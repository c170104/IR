[{"Movie":"Supergirl","Title":"sanvers: all our firsts","Author":"bronwenking4","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12843408","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Maggie groaned, flinging her leather jacket onto her sofa and Running her fingers through her hair, pulling a face as the knots in her hair caught against her fingers. \"dammit!\" She muttered and set about untangling her hair, huffing impatiently when there was no saving it. Resigned to the fact only a shower would help, the young detective stripped down, leaving a trail of clothes from her living room to her bathroom, pulling a cord and pressing the power button. Her shower, which was older than her probably creaked to life, a few droplets sputtering out before a semi pathetic waterfall fell from the showerhead, mildly lukewarm. Mental note to contact her supervisor about that. Stepping under the water, she didn't even flinch as the water came into contact with her skin, letting the water gush over her body. She sighed, pressing her hands flat against the wall, closing her eyes briefly. This was her one safe place where she could be Maggie, not detective Maggie Sawyer, the badass police detective at NCPD who was hard as nails. Maggie, who loved to curl up under a blanket in oversized clothes and eat Ben and Jerrys ice cream from a tub while watching reruns of the L word. Maggie who just wanted to cry after another draining day in the force. She let her mind take her back though the days events. Having been dismissed for firing her weapon and a civilian getting hurt, she was rendered a suspension for a few weeks. Supergirl thankfully had swooped in and given a brief statement staying that the situation was unavoidable and that casualties did happen, pushing her sergeant to only dismiss her for a few weeks. 'At least she did actually do some good' Maggie thought to herself. After at least 40 minutes under the water, having washed and conditioned her hair, Maggie stepped out and wandered naked through her apartment, looking for a towel which she found draped over her dining room chair. Shivering, she wrapped the towel around her and flopped onto her sofa, pressing a button and her TV blared to life. Some reality TV show that she had absolutely no interest in was playing, but it was merely a distraction. Beside her sofa was a bottle of scotch that she'd been steadily working her way through for the last few nights. A hand wrapped around the neck of the bottle and in one swift movement, the screw top flew off, clattering away somewhere across the room. 'Cheers Sawyer, another fine screw-up..' She toasted herself before she touched the bottle to her lips, draining the last of the bottle, ignoring the tears that slowly rolled down her face. Weeks without work? What would she do Now? Days later, at a bar that was known for dealing with aliens, Maggie found herself doing shots, flirting with the bartender as per usual. \"So, how do you like planet earth? Kinda sucks for a planet huh?\" She chuckled darkly as she downed another shot. \"I don't mind it actually I find it quite refreshing.\" Came her voice, leaning provocatively over the counter, being sure Maggie got a full glimpse of her cleavage, much to Maggie's enjoyment. \"The females here are exponentially better than on my planet.\" Maggie's well maintained eyebrow arched, intrigued. \"Is that a fact?\" She looked up, tossing her head back to rid herself off a few stray hairs on her face. \"Oh, definitely.\" The bartender was pretty, for an alien. Aside from the ridges across her nose and her; Maggie squinted slightly. With the amount of alcohol in her system and the terrible lighting in the bar, one could only assume they were gills, aside from that fact, she was pretty. She'd eventually block this night from her memory, once she'd gotten what she wanted. \"I get off in 15 minutes..\" the bartender whispered leaning in close, her lips almost grazing Maggie's ear. Somewhere in her gut, something back flipped. Whispering had something of an arousing effect on the detective. \"I'll meet you outside?\" She asked, not waiting for an answer. Her glass was drained, leaving a lipstick mark on the rim of the glass and shed slipped back into her leather jacket before striding out the door. Outside, it had begun to rain. Turning up the collar of her leather coat, she leant against the wall waiting, shoving her hands deep in her pockets. Now she waited. The alleyway was silent bar a drunk singing to himself, a cat rustling through the bins in search of dinner, bottles rolling away where the wind was blowing. Nothing but silence. Which was just how she liked it. Time ticked by slowly, and Maggie found herself checking her phone repeatedly for a time check. She ignored the several messages from her booty calls as she called them, they were good for nothing more than a one night stand when she was bored. A shout drew her attention. \"Agent Danvers! Stop!\" \"No, I can get him!\" Came a female voice and two figures ran towards, one shrouded in black and one pursuing, a gun raised at shoulder height. Maggie flattened herself against the wall, out of the way of the Chase. \"Stop him!\" Came the females voice again. Not realising she was talking to Her, Maggie didn't move until she felt an arm grip hers with excessive force and she was wrenched from the wall. An arm wrapped around her throat holding her in place. \"Hey, jackass. Get your filthy hands off me!\" Maggie struggled, elbowing her assailant in the 5 main points in the body. Once free of his hold, she flipped him over her shoulder, hearing his body slam against the wet floor. \"Didn't anyone ever tell you it's not right to touch a lady without her permission?\" She spat at the figure on the floor. The second figure, Agent Danvers, slowed her pace, breathing heavily and lowered her gun. \"Thanks. I guess. You know I had him right?\" \"Yeah, sure looked that from where I was standing. You're welcome.\" Maggie muttered, fixing her outfit. Her date would be joining them soon. \"Maggie, Sawyer...' She held out a hand to he figure in front of her. \"Agent Alex Danvers. FBI.\" Alex nodded, holstering her gun and shaking her hand. \"FBI huh? I've never heard of you.\" \"Private sector.\" Alex retorted quickly. \"Completely classified.\" Maggie arched an eyebrow. \"is that so? Well you'll have to excuse me, Agent Danvers...\" She looked her up and down. \"I have a date. She'll be joining me any minute.\" Alex blinked, a little startled at the young woman's sudden abrupt behaviour and the instant admission of her date being a woman. Remarkable how she was so comfortable in her own skin whereas Alex had hidden the fact she was gay for years, forcing herself to date men, but she knew something was missing. \"Right. Well, thank you, Maggie Sawyer. I daresay I'll see you around.\" And Alex grabbed her target, handcuffing him. \"Super girl? You nearby to take this waste of space to jail?\" She said, pressing her earpiece once. \"Copy that.\" Maggie looked around. \"Supergirl? You know Supergirl?\" \"Uh yeah.. actually I do.\" Alex replied shortly before super girl landed, knocking Maggie backwards a few paces. \"Nice job Alex.\" And she was gone as quickly as she came, Alex and her prisoner gone with her. A phone rang, breaking Maggie from her slumber. Grumbling to herself, and untangling herself from her bedsheets, she answered her phone. \"Sawyer..\" Her voice cracking slightly and her head spun as she sat up. \"But sir-\" she stopped. \"I'll be right there.\" And she hung up, sliding from her bed and pulling her jeans on from the night before, her bare-naked ladies t-shirt screwed up from sleeping in it hung over her small frame of a body. A pair of boots and her standard leather jacket and she was out the door. Down at the precinct, she was surprised to see agent Danvers and a guy stood next to Her, dark skinned and broad. \"Agent Danvers.\" \"Sawyer.\" Their eyes met briefly and Maggie could be sworn she saw Alex's eyes darken slightly as they took in her dishevelled appearance. \"Bare-naked ladies? I'm a fan.\" She nodded to her t-shirt causing Maggie to look down. \"Uh yeah. My roommate in college went to see them live once-\" \"Detective Sawyer.\" Came her commanders voice, drawing all their heads. \"Chief.. you called me in.\" She shook his hand, ignoring the throbbing in her head. \"Yes, I'm reinstating you. You'll be working with agent Danvers and her team.\" \"Oh, I uh... Okay? If that's what you want.\" But she gladly took her gun and badge back, clipping her badge to her jeans and her gun strapped back to her hip. \"I want every detail. Nothing gets past me. Understand?\" \"Sir.\" She nodded and turned back to Alex. \"Where do we start?\" \"She is so annoying! She literally thinks she's better than everyone else! I mean-\" Maggie paused to take a drink. \"Okay can I just interject here?\" Lucy chuckled resting her head on her hand. Lucy lane, sister of Lois lane and daughter of general lane was Maggie's closest and most trusted friend. \"It literally sounds like you've got a crush on this chick.\" At that, Maggie nearly spat her drink out \"You're way over the line there Lane.\" \"Am I? Because all you've done is talk about her. Literally. And you've focussed on everything. How she looks, how she moves, everything.\" Lucy stated, sitting up straighter. \"It's okay if you like her y'know.\" She took the bottle from Maggie and took a long swig from it. \"Sawyer, c'mon.. don't look at me like that.\" Maggie rolled her eyes and dropped her gaze. \"It's been a long time since I saw you like this. You've haven't been this way since-\" \"Don't say it. Please.\" Maggie said firmly, grabbing the bottle and taking a swig. \"I don't wanna talk about that, or her.\" \"Okay fine. But I know you like Her, Detective Dimples.\" That earned Lucy a playful shove and them wrestling for a moment, with Maggie coming out the winner. \"You're losing your touch. Daddy not training you any more?\" She muttered as she got off of Lucy, falling back on her sofa. \"Oh he trains me.. I just went easy on you.\" \"Bullshit-\" and her phone rang. \"Speak of the devil...\" She muttered and answered her phone. \"Agent Danvers?\" She had a short conversation and was already pulling her boots on. \"I'm on my way.\" And she hung up. \"Luce, I gotta go.\" She said quickly, kissing her cheek and heading out the door. Down at the docks in National City, Alex was waiting, her arms folded. Her hair lightly curled with her gun strapped to her thigh. \"Didn't think you'd show.\" \"Well you made it sound urgent. What's the problem?\" \"Henshaw, the guy with me yesterday asked me to train you. Make sure you're completely up to speed.\" Maggie raised an eyebrow. \"Right, you're sure /you/ didn't volunteer?\" At that, Alex flushed pink, much to Maggie's amusement. \"Sawyer, let's be professional.\" \"Fine. I just, you just don't seem the type.\" She shrugged and slipped off her jacket. \"My mistake.\" \"What the hell are you doing?\" \"I thought you wanted to spar, to make sure I'm completely up to speed.\" Maggie said quickly, feeling the heat rise in her face, slipping her jacket on. 'Two mistakes Sawyer..' She scolded herself mentally. Alex merely watched her, arms folded with a hidden smirk, showing she was entertained. \"You done? Or do I have to kick your ass another time?\" Maggie's head snapped up. \"You wanna go Danvers? Cuz I swear I'll knock you on your a--\" \"Jeez, calm down. It was a joke Maggie.\" Alex held her hands up in defence. \"We're not spar. I'm taking you for drinks and a game of pool. I know you can handle yourself, you took that guy down easily the other night which was impressive.\" Maggie could feel Alex's eyes on her, looking her over in a way Maggie was familiar with; she did it regularly. Not that it bothered her. She could look all she wanted. \"Thanks. I guess. So, where are we drinking?\" Alex led her to the Alien Bar, a place Maggie was far too familiar with, much to Alex's surprise. \"I'll take a beer, thanks.\" \"Back again, with Alex Danvers of all people?\" the pretty bartender asked Maggie, raising an eyebrow, her eyes darting between the two. Having a power of being able to see the potential future, she foresaw them finding each other and making a couple. \"You stood me up on our date Sawyer. You owe me.\" Maggie rolled her eyes, taking the beer off the counter and popping the lid, not even giving her an answer. Alex raised an eyebrow, at the bartenders statement. \"You owe her?\" \"I was meant to hook up with there that night you ran into me. Plans changed.\" Came Maggie's resigned voice, taking a swing of her beer Not that it was any of Alex's business who she hooked up with but Maggie was sure that Alex had a hint of jealousy in her voice. \"I'll take a beer too.\" Alex muttered. \"So, why have you brought me here?\" Maggie said, four or five drinks into the night, a trail of empty bottles lay scattered across the bar. \"I wanted to get to know you, seeing as well be working together now. I like to get to know my potential work partners. Is that a crime?\" \"No, but it just seems a bit strange that you've invited me for drinks to get to know me. Couldn't you have just run a background check on me?\" \"We have. I know that your name is Margarita Sawyer, daughter to Oscar Rodas. Born in Blue Springs, Nebraska.\" Maggie opened her mouth to interject. \"I know you wear a size 36 shoe, your clothing size is average for a woman of your height and build-...\" \"Okay. Okay. I get the hint. You've done your research at least. You know about me, but you don't know me.\" Maggie retorted quickly. \"Y'know, I'm gonna go home. I don't need the third degree from you. I'll see you on assignments. It's best we leave it at that.\" She said firmly, draining her glass and slipping her jacket on. \"Nice to see you again Danvers.\" She flipped her hair over the collar of her jacket and left the Bar, shoving her hands deep in her pockets. Her temper boiled. Who the hell did she think she was? What gave Alex Danvers, beautiful Alex Danvers the right to grill her only days after meeting her?! Maggie cursed furiously at how startling she found Alex, how beautiful she was. Her eyes, the way they softened when she saw Maggie, her smile, her lips, everything. Slowing her pace as she rounded the corner of the street, she ran into an old flame. \"Emily?\" \"Maggie? You Okay? You've got that look about you. A girl's got under your skin. Hasn't She?' \"W-what? No. Don't be so ridiculous.\" Maggie eventually got out after scoffing. \"Maggie!\" Came Alex's voice. \"You mind telling me what you're playing at?\" She ran to her side, her breath forming a cloud in front of her. \"None of your Goddamn business Danvers. Last time I checked, you weren't my mom.\" Emily looked between the two women. \"Whoa, okay. Listen, I'm gonna go. Uh, nice to see you though.\" And she left quickly. \"Maggie, we're work partners now. That means I have a duty of care to you. Now, what is wrong?\" There was that look, a look that could melt Maggie's heart in an instance. She was already wanting Alex Danvers, a girl who wasn't even gay, who she'd only just met and Maggie wanted her. Alex, with her chocolate brown eyes and her chocolate brown hair. \"It's-\" she paused and shook her head. \"It's nothing. I gotta get home. See you at work tomorrow.\" And she left. \"Maggie...\" Alex sighed and headed to her sister, Kara's, who just happened to be Super Girl. Back in her apartment, Maggie lay on her bed, one arm folded behind her head and her other folded across her stomach, letting the tears roll. Frustrated that people only ever saw the hard faced cop, Maggie turned over, grabbing her stuffed toy and burying her face in the fabric. Since her parents rejected her at a young age, exiling her from the house for being gay, she had trouble trusting people and opening up to others. Afraid of more rejection, Maggie created this facade of being a tough girl, one who hid her feelings away. And somehow, in less than a week, Alex Danvers had reduced her to a mess of emotions.

This is the first part of my series of one-shots. This takes place in season 3 but Mon-el is still on earth and dating Kara. I hope you enjoy it. Cat Grant is also still in the serie. I hate that they cut here out again. she's my favorite character. Oh and Reign isn't Reign yet. This is kind of like what could have happend in 2x17 with a bit of a twist. Kara Danvers is just an ordinary reporter. Or so everyone thinks. In the day she is a reporter at Catco Magazine but at night she is a superhero. Of course the world doesn't know that it's the mild mannered, sweet reporter that is saving them all the time. But something will change that very soon. You see not everyone is a fan of Supergirl. There are tons of criminals who want her death. And one of those criminals has a lot of money. So this criminal has set a bounty on her name, not only for humans, but also for aliens. And one particularly strong mind controller thought of it as a challenge. What will happen? Kara Danvers was working on an article that needed to be done at the end of the day. Which meant she didn't go out to get lunch. Which meant her boyfriend had to come and rescue her. He came in the building carrying chinees, ice and a lot of potstickers. \"Hey sweetie.\" Mon-el said as he set the food on her desk. Kara gasped. \"Are those what I think they are? 'cuz if they are, I love you even more then this morning.\" Kara said. \"Prepare to love me even more than this morning.\" Mon-el answered. She laughed and gave him a kiss. \"How are you doing with your article?\" he asked. \"Oh, it's going okay. I still need to do a lot, but now there's you and food, I think I'll be fine.\" He laughed and saw James and Winn coming their way. \"Hey James, Winn. Is there something wrong? what are you doing at Catco?\" Kara asked while Mon-el also greeted them. \"Nothing, We were going bowling, and decided to ask if you guys wanted to come?\" Winn answered. \"Even though I would really like a break and go with you, I can't. I have a ton of work to do. But I'll see you guys later\" she answered. \"I'm gonna stay with Kara but thanks for asking.\" Before they could leave, Lena, Sam and Ruby were standing Kara's desk. \"Hey guys. What's going on?\" Kara asked. \"Oh nothing really, we just came to say hello and get a copy of some files. Do you mind if Ruby stays here till I get them?\" Sam asks. \"Of course not. Ruby is always welcome.\" she answered while Mon-el gave her a high-five. \"You want something to eat?\" he asked. She nodded and he turned to open a bag, and in doing so, he knocked over some papers. \"Sorry.\" he said while the others chuckled. He leant down to grab them but half way he stopped. \"Mike? (he still has his civilian name at Catco and stuff) are you okay?\" Kara asked while she arched her eyebrows. \"Yeah I'm... I can't move.\" he said. Kara chuckled nervously. \"What are you talking about?\" His eyes became shining blue for a second and Kara immediately stood up. \"Get back.\" she said to her friends. The confusedly backed up. \"Mike? Can you hear me?\" Mon-el looked up and punched Kara in the stomach so she stumbled backwards. \"O my god! Kara I'm so sorry!\" he said. \"I don't have any controle over my body.\" They suddenly had the attention of the whole floor. \"What are you doing Mike?\" Lena asked. \"I don't know. It's not me.\" Sam immediately grabbed Ruby and put her behind her. Winn and James were frozen. As Mon-el threw another punch which Kara dodged she looked at them. \"I think it's a good idea to call Alex and J'onn don't you think.\" she said to the two of them as they sprang to action. A lot of people came to watch what was going on, including Cat. Most of them either backed away immediately or began filming. Mon-el kept throwing punches which she just dodged, over and over again. \"You have to fight it!\" \"I'm trying.\" As Kara became distracted for a second because of a flash from a camera, Mon-el could throw a hard punch on her stomach again. It was so powerful Kara was thrown back against a wall which rumbled and she fell to the ground with a loud bang. There were a few screams but the loudest one was from Mon-el. \"Kara!\" Of course a lot of people didn't expect Kara to get back up again seeing as a human wouldn't just shrug off such a blast. But she did. And when she did, she didn't look like Kara anymore. She had lost her glasses because of the blast. The civilians hadn't put it together yet. Of course Cat Grant did. She had known for years. And she was seriously worried for hero and friend. The floor grew silent. Sam, Lena and Ruby were watching their friend with wide eyes. How could she stand? James and Winn had called the DEO and they were on their way. But would they be on time? \"K-Kara?\" Lena whispered. The eyes of Mon-el turned bright blue again and a voice took over. \"It's great to meet you. Kara Danvers.\" a deep voice said. \"What do you want?\" Kara asked. \"You have a bounty on you're head. And I would like the money.\" \"A bounty? From who?\" she asked. \"I'm sorry. Really fast. Why would Kara Danvers have a bounty on her head?\" Lena bravely intercepted. \"Oh no, I'm sorry, that was confusing. Kara Danvers doesn't have a bounty on her head, but Supergirl does.\" The rest of the floor didn't know what to make of it. If he wanted Supergirl, why would he go after Kara? Cat Grant was about to say something snarky, because she is Cat Grant, but she was cut off by agents who came storming out of the elevator. \"Alex. Finally.\" Winn said. Alex and J'onn ran to the fight with guns in their hands. \"Mon-el? What is going on here?\" J'onn asked. \"Mon-el? Who is Mon-el?\" Sam asked as James explained it really quick. \"Alex. get everyone out of here. I'll deal with this one.\" Kara said. At this point the whole thing was being filmed and live broadcasted by the news. \"And how would you be dealing with him?\" Sam screamed. \"Oh... Oh she doesn't know does she? That's not so nice.\" Mon-el/weird voice said. He turned to her friends and the camera. \"This so called reporter is not who she says she is. This whole life is just a mask.\" he began but Alex charged to him. \"Alex no!\" Kara screamed. Mon-el wanted to throw a punch, but Kara used her super speed to get between her loved ones. \"Mon-el, You have to stop. You have to fight it!\" The bystanders saw what Kara had done and it clicked. The camera had recorded what Kara had done and it was broadcasted live to all of the city. \"K-Kara... You're Supergirl.\" Lena said. After giving her friends an 'I'm sorry' glance she grabbed 'Mon-el' by his collar and ran him in the wall with superspeed. When she stood still again, Kara Danvers was gone. Instead there stood a girl with curly blond hair, a blue shirt, red boots and skirt and an cape. Supergirl. Lena and Sam were shocked. Their best friend was an alien. And not just an alien. She was Supergirl. Ruby had a huge smile plastered on her face. Supergirl... She knew supergirl. And even outside her suit, Supergirl was her hero. Cat Grant immediately ordered the camera's to shut down. She would do everything in her power to make sure this informatie would not leave these walls. Although deep down she already knew she was too late. James and Winn were extremely worried for there best friends and blamed themselves for not doing enough. Alex wanted to slap herself. How could she let this happen? Kara was leaning over Mon-el to check if he was okay. \"Mon-el?\" She was painfully aware of the crowd behind her. The camera. The silence. Her friends. But she couldn't focus on that yet. She shook Mon-el for a second before he woke up. \"Kara? What happend?\" he confusedly asked. She let out a relieved sign and turned around. She saw everyone staring at her. \"You're really her? You're really Supergirl?\" Ruby asked. I gave her a little smile. \"I will talk with you guys about this, but first I got an alien to catch.\" She stepped out on the balcony and took of while communicating with Alex and J'onn. After about an hour of fighting, Supergirl flew in the DEO. Alex and J'onn said that Sam, Ruby and Lena were waiting at her loft. So she flew to her loft and entered through the window. Her friends were waiting at her table. When she flew in they stood up and looked at her with eyes wide. \"Hey guys. Listen I know I have a lot to explain but before you something please know that I really wanted to tell you but couldn't.\" Kara immediately said. Lena walked over to her and gave her a hug. \"My best friend is a alien, who is dating a alien... I'm still processing it.\" Sam said. \"I hope it's not a problem.\" \"Oh no. I don't have anything against aliens, it's just I hadn't expected it from you. Or Mike... Mon-el\" \"I do have to ask. Did you become my friend because I'm a Luthor?\" Lena asked carefully. \"No absolute not. I became your friend because you are an amazing person.\" Ruby looked like she just won a lottery. \"Ruby? Are you okay with this?\" Kara asked carefully as she crouched in front of her. \"Okay? I'm awesome with this. I know Supergirl. You are Supergirl. How can I not be okay with this?\" She said. Kara chuckled. 'I'm glad you think about it like this.\" she answered. \"Listen I have to go for a sec. I gotta go talk to Cat. Are you guys okay with that?\" \"Definitely. Go.\" they said. She flew out of the window again. Cat Grant stood on her balcony as Supergirl landed besides her. \"Hello, Kara.\" she said. \"Ms. Grant.\" \"Oh for god's sake. Just call me Cat. I think you've saved me enough times for that.\" Kara chuckled. \"I'm guessing you're not here for a drink?' Cat asked. \"No I'm not... You already knew, didn't you?\" Kara asked. Her boss nodded. \"Yep. You were my assistant, and I'm Cat Grant. You do the math.\" They looked at the city in silence. \"So what happens now?\" Cat asked. \"Actually, I came here to ask you that.\" the reporter answered. \"You want to know if you still have your job? Well as I see it, you do, but it's up to you really. Do you still want it?\" \"I do. This job is the only normal thing I still have. I would do anything to keep it.\" she answered. \"You can have it if you want, If you promise me one thing.\" Cat said. The hero looked at her with eyebrows arched. \"You give me an exclusief.\" The boss said laughing. A/N Hey guys. this was the first part.

Bravo","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11404066","Passage":"[Chapter 1] SUPERGIRL: LA CIUDAD INFINITA Parte Dos (Escrito por Federico H. Bravo. Basado libremente en \"Ciudad\" , de Ricardo Barreiro y J. Giménez) Resumen de la Primera Parte : Con Superman exiliado en el espacio, su prima Kara intenta rehacer su vida mudándose a Metrópolis. Para su desgracia, el destino arruinó sus intenciones al transportarla a la Ciudad, una urbe fantástica e infinita donde todo puede ser, y donde todas las líneas de tiempo y mundos del multiverso convergen… En la Ciudad, Kara conoce a Helena Wayne –alias \"Huntress\"– la hija del Batman de un universo alternativo, perdida tras la Crisis en las Tierras Infinitas, y juntas deciden marchar tras un objetivo que parece imposible: hallar una salida . Pero el camino no será fácil ni exento de peligros. La Ciudad todavía guarda sorpresas terribles que ambas deberán descubrir. 1 EL CAMPEÓN El largo viaje por la Ciudad acabó llevando a Kara y Helena a un nuevo sector de la misma; un sitio alucinante cuyos edificios tenían un marcado diseño arquitectónico decididamente alienígena. -¿Qué te parece esto? – preguntó Helena, deteniendo el Hummer en mitad de la calle. Kara y ella salieron del vehículo – ¿Tú que crees? -No es terrestre – corroboró la rubia. -¿Kryptoniano? -No. Pero no es terrestre – insistió Kara, frunciendo el ceño. -Ya. Se ve como si George Lucas la hubiese diseñado… es escalofriante. -¿Quién? -¿Qué? -George Lucas, ¿Quién es? -Ay, Kara. ¿Todavía no has visto Star Wars ? -Voy algo atrasada con las películas de la Tierra. -Si algún día se produce el milagro y salimos de aquí (que no creo), prometo llevarte al cine yo misma. La referencia del cine hizo que Kara recordase con tristeza a su fallecida amiga y vecina, Deborah Watters.1 Tuvo bien no decirle nada a Helena al respecto y entonces ambas mujeres emprendieron la exploración de ese sector de la urbe, viendo qué maravillas podría llegar a contener. Mientras las dos chicas atravesaban los edificios de diseño extraterrestre, en uno de ellos, una atenta Inteligencia Artificial las detectó y se dispuso a tomar medidas respecto a su intrusión: -Dos criaturas desconocidas han penetrado en el Sector Z – dijo – ¡El Campeón debe ser despertado! Hubo una descarga eléctrica, un siseo y una cámara acorazada se abrió. Un alienígena alto, con facciones reptiloides y enfundado en una armadura de tecnología avanzada salió, preocupado. -Campeón – le dijo la voz de la computadora – Te necesitamos. -¿Qué sucede? -Detectamos intrusos en la zona – le explicó – Dos organismos de carbono, con cuatro extremidades cada uno. El Campeón frunció el ceño. -Muéstrame su localización – pidió. Un pequeño holograma se desplegó ante él. -Cuadrante 3, Sector Z – dijo la IA. -¿Cómo han llegado hasta aquí? ¿Lo sabes? -En un vehículo primitivo de combustión petrolífera. Pero ahora marchan a pie. -¿Motivaciones? -No las conocemos. Podrían ser o no hostiles. -Si lo son, responderán ante mí – el alienígena comenzó a caminar – Abre la puerta. Una pesada escotilla se abrió. A través de ella, se veía el exterior. El extraterrestre la atravesó, saliendo. -Te has dado cuenta, ¿verdad? – comentó Helena. Kara y ella estaban paradas ante un gran rascacielos – Todo este sitio está cubierto de una sustancia dorada, como una especie de ámbar de origen artificial… Alguna clase de superplastico. -No lo entiendo – Kara tocó la cobertura – ¿Para qué construir algo y luego envolverlo? No tiene lógica. -Coincido. -Tal vez si miramos en su interior… - los ojos de Kara brillaron con fuego rojo. -¿Qué vas a hacer? -Quemaré un poco el ámbar para que… Se interrumpió. Un extraño fenómeno se produjo: todo el recubrimiento del edificio colapso, derretido. -¿Qué hiciste, Kara? – exclamó Helena, preocupada. -¡Nada! ¡Sólo quería abrir un acceso, eso es todo! Parece que esta sustancia es extremadamente sensible. -Bueno, ni modo – Helena suspiró – Entremos y veamos que hay… Así lo hicieron, cuidadosamente. Las luces se encendieron y las dos vieron una habitación alucinante, repleta de máquinas increíbles. -Nadie – Helena resopló – La luz debió encenderse por un sensor de movimiento. Me pregunto qué otras maravillas habrá por aquí… Un proyector holográfico se activó. Aparecieron imágenes del cosmos y sus estrellas. -¿Kara? Esta parece ser más tu área. -Es un mapa estelar de la galaxia – lo estudió detenidamente – Creo que puedo identificar la Tierra aquí… y tal vez el mundo de origen de todo este lugar. -¿Qué hacen aquí? – rugió el Campeón, entrando en la habitación furioso, las armas de su traje activadas – ¿Quiénes son? ¡Respóndanme! -¡Tenemos compañía, Kara! – Helena extrajo una pistola de sus ropas. Efectuó un disparo. La bala rebotó en la armadura del extraterrestre, sin causarle el más mínimo daño. -¡Tú! – el Campeón la ignoró. Señaló a Kara – ¡Destruiste el sello protector, e invadiste una propiedad bajo mi protección! ¡Eres una amenaza peligrosa! -Un momento, un momento – Kara alzó las manos – ¡Fue sin querer! Ese material era demasiado sensible. Pero el Campeón no la escuchaba. Se abalanzó sobre ella, con intención de atraparla. A Kara no le quedó otra más que defenderse: le propinó un puñetazo que lo mandó volando por el aire. No pasó mucho hasta que el extraterrestre volvió a la carga. Impulsado por cohetes adheridos a su traje, se le tiró encima y la empujó. Ambos atravesaron una pared, destrozándola, y cayeron a la calle. Helena se acercó al agujero y observó el titánico combate entre los dos a golpes de puño y patadas… -¿Qué clase de criatura eres? – le preguntó el Campeón, durante la contienda. -¡Ya fue suficiente! – Kara se plantó, negándose a continuar la lucha – No sé quién eres o qué quieres, pero yo no quise… Fue inútil. El Campeón estaba tan furioso que no atendía razones. Le largó una patada y luego, otro puñetazo. Kara decidió eludirlo a supervelocidad. Cuando el extraterrestre menos se lo esperaba, le asestó un gancho directo en el estómago. La armadura protegió a la criatura, pero el impacto la hizo atravesar varios edificios. -¡Kara! – Helena se unió a ella – ¿Estás bien? -Sí, Hel. ¡Pero este tipo no atiende razones! Parece que solo quiere pelear. ¡Ahí vuelve! Impulsado por los cohetes de su traje, el guerrero alienígena había vuelto, listo para un nuevo round. -No sé de dónde vienes, pero no permitiré más destrucción – le dijo y activó sus cañones de plasma. Se disponía a disparar, cuando la voz de la IA lo interrumpió. -Campeón, cesa toda agresión – le ordenó, surgiendo de su armadura – Repito: cesa toda agresión. He analizado a la criatura que combates. Es kryptoniana. -¿Qué? ¡Eso es imposible! – el extraterrestre se detuvo. Observó a la muchacha con recelo – ¿No murieron todos cuando su planeta explotó, hace muchos ciclos? -Es verdad, pero por increíble que parezca, ella es kryptoniana… e inocente. -¿Cómo dices? -Mientras peleabas, he analizado sus acciones y comportamiento. Mi conclusión es que no es hostil. Repito: no es hostil. -¡Es lo que he intentado decirte! – retrucó Kara – Destruí ese material sin querer. Sólo estamos de paso y explorábamos, nada más. El Campeón estaba confundido, pero bajó sus armas y obedeció. En ese momento, cesó todo ataque. -Creo que debemos charlar – dijo la IA a través de su armadura – Campeón, regresa a la base y trae a esas dos hembras contigo. Aclararemos esta situación… 2 LA HISTORIA DEL CAMPEÓN El lugar era igual a todo lo demás que habían visto hasta ahora: alienígena. Había máquinas y computadoras extrañas zumbando y trabajando incansablemente en toda la habitación en la cual ingresaron. Antes de charlar con ellas, como prometiera, la IA mandó al Campeón a reposar un rato. -¿Será prudente? – preguntó el extraterrestre, todavía algo receloso con las dos mujeres – ¿Qué pasará con las hembras? -Quédate tranquilo. Todo está bajo control. Además, tu cuerpo y tu armadura necesitan regenerarse. Entra en tu cámara y duerme, mientras yo me ocupo de los procedimientos de rutina. Cuando el Campeón se marchó y Kara y Helena se quedaron solas, la Inteligencia Artificial se presentó ante ellas proyectando un holograma de su rostro, una cara con facciones similares a las del guerrero. -¿Cómo es que sabes sobre Krypton y su gente? – le preguntó Kara. -Hace varios ciclos atrás, intercepté y descifré transmisiones radiales kryptonianas. Conozco vuestra raza y cultura. Cuando pude confirmar tu naturaleza, detuve al Campeón. -\"El Campeón\"… Háblanos sobre él – pidió Helena – y sobre cómo este sitio acabó en la Ciudad. -El Campeón… En su nombre está explicitó su propósito – les explicó – Provenimos de un planeta muy lejano. Hace años, unos invasores llegaron e intentaron dominarnos… Vencieron nuestras defensas, pero gracias al poder de su armadura de combate, el Campeón los derrotó. Eventualmente, los invasores se vengaron y lanzaron un asteroide a nuestro mundo natal… ni con todo su poder, el Campeón pudo detenerlo ni desviar su trayectoria. El impacto resultante mató a millones y muchos más murieron por el cataclismo. -Que espanto – comentó Kara, sobrecogida. -Los sobrevivientes, desesperados, construyeron cámaras subterráneas para mantenerse en animación suspendida. Todavía están ahí, a la espera de despertar. -¿Y el Campeón? -Fue el único que quedó activo – la holo-imagen suspiró, apesadumbrada – Con mi ayuda, inició la reconstrucción de nuestra principal ciudad y aisló algunos edificios, para que estuvieran listos para nuestra gente. -Sigues sin responder a mi pregunta – insistió Helena – ¿Cómo terminó todo este sitio formando parte de la Ciudad? -Ignoramos las causas exactas. Sólo puedo teorizar. -Adelante. -Fuimos secuestrados. Silencio. -Secuestrados, ¿por quién? -Por el creador de la Ciudad. Kara y Helena se miraron. -¿Hay un creador de este sitio? – preguntó la primera. -He analizado el diseño de esta amalgama de mundos y líneas temporales… mi conclusión es que sí, existe un creador. O creadores. Bien podrían ser más de uno. Respecto a su naturaleza y origen, no sé nada. Pero también puedo teorizar que han de ser poderosos. Las leyes de la física se tuercen en este sitio de posibilidades infinitas. Helena meditó largo rato lo que acababa de oír. Aquello confirmaba ciertas sospechas suyas: existía un poder real tras la Ciudad, un propósito . No estaba allí simplemente por azar. -¿Conoces alguna salida? – inquirió Kara, esperanzada. -Negativo. Pero sigo analizándolo todo. Tal vez algún día, la encuentre. -¿Crees poder ayudarnos? Mi amiga y yo buscamos un sitio seguro en este infierno. Preferentemente, con seres parecidos a nosotras – Helena miró a Kara – Cualquier dato al respecto vendría bien. Otro holograma fue proyectado. Era una representación a escala de la Ciudad: edificio tras edificio tras edificio. -Esto es lo poco que he podido sondear de los alrededores – explicó la IA – Si bien es extenso, la Ciudad se expande más allá de mi alcance. Si siguen esta ruta, podrán llegar a un gran asentamiento compuesto por humanos. -Ok – Helena tomó notal mental del camino – Gracias. Vamos, Kara. Tenemos que seguir. -Pero… ¿Y el Campeón? – la chica se volvió para mirar al holograma de la IA – ¿Por qué no viene con nosotras? ¡Si nos unimos, podremos hallar juntos una salida! -El Campeón tiene su misión, la cual es proteger lo que queda de nuestra cultura, de nuestro mundo – se excusó – Él está donde tiene que estar. Les deseo suerte con su empresa, allá donde vayan. -Vamos, Kara – insistió Helena – Ya hemos perdido mucho tiempo. Tenemos que continuar. A Kara no le gustaba irse así a las apuradas, pero comprendió que su amiga tenía razón: todavía les quedaba un largo trecho por delante y además, ahora sabían que alguien había construido la Ciudad con un propósito. ¿Quién sería? ¿Cuál era ese propósito? Sólo podrían averiguarlo más adelante, si seguían marchando. 3 CASTLEVILLE El Hummer era historia. Luego de llevarlas durante interminables kilómetros, el vehículo dijo \"basta\" y se quedó sin combustible. Sin forma de recargarlo, Kara y Helena lo abandonaron a su suerte y pertrechadas con sus bolsos y mochilas, ambas echaron a andar nuevamente a pie, confiando poder alcanzar el asentamiento humano que la IA extraterrestre les había dicho que existía en esa dirección. -Creo que nunca caminé tanto en mi vida. Y encima, con este condenado Sol – Helena se limpió el sudor de la frente y tomó un trago de agua de su cantimplora – ¿Es mi impresión, o está haciendo más calor? -El Sol está en lo alto – corroboró Kara – Es curioso. Hace bastantes horas que es de día. Ya debería haber anochecido… -Ya te lo dije: la duración de los días y de las noches son relativas aquí, lo mismo que las estaciones del año. Hay sitios donde es un invierno perpetuo y otros, donde siempre es verano. Me pregunto si… Helena se quedó muda, lo mismo Kara. Ambas habían llegado a una gran empalizada con alambres de púas en la cima, reflectores y una reja de entrada. Y una torre con guardias armados. De hecho, estos últimos ya les apuntaban con sus armas… -¡Quietas ahí! – les gritaron – ¡Identifíquense! ¿Amigos o enemigos? -¿Qué tipo de pregunta es esa? – murmuró Kara, desconcertada. -Una hecha por desconfiados – Helena se adelantó. Alzó las manos – ¡No buscamos pelea, soldado! Queremos seguridad, refugio, comida y un sitio decente donde asearnos y dormir, nada más. ¿Conocen un lugar así? Los centinelas vacilaron. Se miraron entre sí. -Entonces, han venido al sitio indicado, señorita – respondieron – Esta es la entrada a Castleville, el único lugar con orden en toda esta maldita Ciudad. Aquí viven todas las personas que tienen un poco de sentido común y quieren llevar una vida organizada. -¿Qué dices? – le susurró Helena a Kara – Suena muy bonito para ser cierto. -Tal vez sea el asentamiento que buscábamos. Estoy usando mi visión de rayos X y mi superoído para saber qué hay tras esa empalizada. Veo y escucho a cientos, quizás miles de personas. -Ok – Helena lo pensó. Volvió a hablar con los soldados – ¿Y si nosotros fuéramos esa clase de gente de la que hablan? ¿Cómo podríamos hacer para vivir en este sitio? Los centinelas conferenciaron entre sí. -Pues… primero tienen que dejar fuera todas las posibles armas que traigan encima y luego reconocer la autoridad del Gobernador. Si así lo hacen y acatan nuestras leyes, serán bienvenidas. Si no, pueden seguir con su camino. -¿Quién es el Gobernador? -La autoridad suprema de Castleville. El legislador de nuestras leyes… -No me gusta cómo suena eso – Helena frunció el ceño. -¡Castleville tiene sus normas! – los soldados alzaron su tono de voz, endureciéndolo – ¡Estamos abiertos a aceptar a gente nueva, si respetan nuestras leyes! La decisión es suya. -Hel… ¿Qué otra opción tenemos? – repuso Kara – Creo que tendríamos que entrar y al menos, ver qué onda. -De acuerdo, de acuerdo. Pero mantén tus súper-sentidos alerta. Podemos encontrar cualquier cosa ahí dentro, tras esas puertas. -¿Y bien? – las acicatearon los centinelas – ¿Qué deciden? -¡Abran el portón! Estamos dentro. 4 DUDAS EN EL PARAISO Del otro lado de la empalizada les aguardaba un barrio totalmente civilizado y densamente poblado. Después de que ambas dejaran –Helena, a regañadientes– sus armas en la entrada, una especie de \"guía turístico\" las llevó a dar un recorrido por la zona a bordo de un veloz jeep… -Espero que decidan quedarse con nosotros – les comentó, mientras manejaba – Castleville es un lindo sitio en el que vivir. Prácticamente, somos como un oasis en medio del desierto. -Eso vemos – sentada a su lado, Helena hojeaba el mapa turístico que le habían entregado, señalando con una lapicera todos los puntos de interés para conocer – Veo que ocupan muchas cuadras dentro de la Ciudad. Casi son una localidad en sí misma. -Es verdad – el conductor sonrió – Todo se lo debemos al Gobernador. Sin su presteza, don de mando e inteligencia, Castleville nunca hubiera podido prosperar. La mención otra vez al gobernante de aquél sitio alarmó un poco a Helena, pero tuvo bien no hacérselo notar al guía. Tenía sus propias reservas al respecto, mismas que eran compartidas por Kara, quien viajaba sentada en el asiento de atrás, observándolo todo con sus súper-sentidos alertas. En ese momento, atravesaron una avenida repleta de vehículos en movimiento y llena hasta el tope de personas paseando. La estampa urbana era similar a la de la Quinta Avenida de Manhattan en pleno mediodía. El contraste entre la actividad mundana de aquel sitio y el silencio y la desolación que reinaban habitualmente en el resto de la Ciudad era evidente. Hasta vieron varios policías rondando por allí, en las esquinas y dirigiendo el transito… -¿Puedo saber sus nombres? – preguntó el guía. -Me llamo Helena Wayne. -Yo soy Karen Star. Helena observó a su amiga por el espejo retrovisor del jeep. Por alguna razón, había decidido utilizar otro nombre y no el suyo propio. \"Chica prudente\" , pensó, \"Aprende rápido\" . -Yo soy Taylor. Mucho gusto – doblaron una esquina – Perdonen si parezco muy curioso, pero… ¿Alguna de ustedes, por casualidad, es médico? -Bueno… No exactamente., pero tengo algunos conocimientos en primeros auxilios – Helena se colocó unas gafas de Sol. Estaba resultando ser un día excesivamente caluroso y brillante – Además, mi abuelo era cirujano.2 -¿Y usted, señorita? -Ah, lo lamento – Kara sonrió – Soy periodista… o en eso estaba, cuando llegué aquí. ¿Hay algún inconveniente con nuestras profesiones? -En absoluto. Pero, como comprenderán, el personal médico no abunda mucho por aquí. La salud es prioritaria y más, habiendo tanta gente. El guía detuvo el jeep. Habían llegado a su primer lugar de destino: un parque de diversiones. -Tendremos que seguir a pie – el conductor se bajó – Vengan conmigo. Les mostraré el sitio. Kara y Helena lo siguieron. Todo en aquél sitio parecía en su lugar: montañas rusas, carruseles, ruletas, juegos de tiro al blanco, algodones de azúcar, payasos, globos… y niños corriendo por todas partes. Un cuadro de felicidad que, en el fondo, a Helena le dio cierto temor. -Tomen – Taylor les alcanzó dos algodones de azúcar – Para ustedes. -Oh. Pero no tenemos dinero… -No importa. Cortesía de la casa. Hoy pago yo. -Caray – Kara probó el alimento y le gustó – Gracias. Humm… Está muy rico… nunca había comido algo semejante… ¿Hel? ¿Qué sucede? Su amiga fruncía el ceño. Miraba a un hombre que se tambaleaba alarmantemente mientras caminaba. Parecía enfermo. De repente, el tipo se desplomó en el piso, presa de violentas convulsiones y echando espuma por la boca. El efecto fue instantáneo: pánico total entre la gente que se encontraba allí, igual a como si hubiesen puesto una bomba. Los padres agarraron a sus hijos y echaron a correr, mientras gritaban \"¡La peste, la peste!\" . -Creo que deberíamos ayudar – Kara comenzó a acercarse al hombre, pero Taylor la detuvo, sosteniéndola del brazo. -No se preocupe, señorita. El servicio de sanidad ya viene a hacerse cargo. Mire, ahí están – señaló a unos tipos que llegaban, vestidos con trajes presurizados de riesgo biológico. Entre todos, metieron al afectado en una camioneta negra y partieron rápidamente – ¿Ven? Nada de lo que preocuparse. Todo bajo control. Ahora, si me acompañan, podremos seguir con el recorrido… -Un momento, un momento – Helena se plantó – ¿Qué está sucediendo? ¿De qué estaba enfermo ese tipo? ¿Dónde se lo llevaron? Taylor vaciló. -Lo lamento – se disculpó – No estoy autorizado a hablarles sobre el tema. No todavía – se apuró a corregir – Si deciden quedarse, tal vez puedan saber más sobre este peculiar problemita que tenemos en Castleville. ¡Pero bueno! Sigamos con el recorrido. Vengan. El guía volvió al jeep. Kara y Helena se demoraron un poco en unírsele para una rápida charla: -No me fio de nada – dijo la segunda – Acá hay gato encerrado… -Opino lo mismo. -Mantén los ojos bien abiertos. Cuando acabe el recorrido y nos instalemos en la comunidad, podremos averiguar por nuestra cuenta qué secretos esconde este supuesto paraíso ideal. 5 INTEGRANDOSE A LA COMUNIDAD En concreto, Kara y Helena tuvieron dos meses para ajustarse e integrarse a la comunidad. Dos meses en los que ambas debieron ganarse la confianza de sus nuevos vecinos de la única manera posible: trabajando . Aportando sus talentos y habilidades al bien común. Como Helena sabía sobre la administración de empresas y de leyes, acabó oficiando de legista en el selecto circulo de privilegiados cercanos al Gobernador. Trabajaba en el palacio, un auténtico castillo ubicado en el centro de la localidad –de ahí venia su nombre, \"Castleville\" –. El sitio era el punto neurálgico donde se dictaban las leyes y se administraba la justicia. Si bien desempeñaba sus funciones prácticamente sin problemas, todavía no había podido ver al misterioso gobernante del lugar. Aquel hecho por demás insólito era habitual para la gente de Castleville. \"El Gobernador está muy ocupado con asuntos de vital importancia\" , solían decirle y todos sus intentos por entrevistarse con él en persona fracasaron… Para Kara, adaptarse a la comunidad fue un poco más difícil. Después de probar ejercer el rol de reportera del único periódico de Castleville –un diario llamado \"El Independiente\" , que de eso, sólo tenía el nombre nada más. Las noticias bajaban directamente del palacio y ninguna hablaba de la misteriosa enfermedad que se llevaba silenciosamente miles de vidas– intentó ocupar el rol de maestra en un Jardín de Infantes. Este empleo era muchísimo más sencillo y si bien descubrió que adoraba a los niños terrestres, también sintió que el tiempo comenzaba a pasar y todavía no sabían qué peste mataba a la gente, quién y cómo era el Gobernador y – más importante aún– si algún día volverían a sus mundos y universos de origen. Al cabo de los dos meses trabajando y viviendo en la comunidad de Castleville, las dos muchachas convinieron en reunirse en un discreto restaurante para comer, charlar y ver los pasos a seguir. -Estoy harta – Helena suspiró. Encendió un cigarrillo y fumó – Las horas de oficina me están matando. Mantener funcionando la burocracia de este sitio es extenuante. -Yo, la verdad, no es que pueda quejarme – Kara jugueteaba con la comida de su plato con el tenedor – Los niños son maravillosos. Siempre están deseosos de aprender cosas nuevas… como yo. -Los niños son lindos… sobre todo, cuando no son de una, je. Silencio. -Hel, no podemos seguir así. -No. -Tenemos que hacer algo. -Lo sé. -Hay gente muriendo ahí fuera, de una peste desconocida. ¡Y nadie hace nada! Ni siquiera hablan de ello. -Lo sé. Todos mis intentos por conversar sobre el tema con mis compañeros de trabajo chocan contra una pared. Es evidente que esta comunidad idílica, este \"paraíso terrenal\" de civilización y orden esconde un secreto. -Tenemos que descubrirlo. -Sí – Helena fumó en silencio un buen rato. Luego, apagó el cigarrillo en el cenicero – Mi plan de integrarnos a la comunidad y pasar desapercibidas para averiguar algo no funcionó. Vamos a tener que ser más drásticas. -¿Qué quieres decir? Helena señaló hacia una ventana. La silueta del palacio de gobierno se recortaba contra el Sol del mediodía. -Creo que es hora de que Supergirl y Huntress vuelvan a la acción y le hagan una visita personal al dueño de este lugar… 6 EL GOBERNADOR Castleville. Noche. Por suerte para Helena, si bien habían confiscado todas sus armas a la entrada a la comunidad, se las arregló para recuperarlas. Vestida con su traje negro, con la capa y el antifaz, Huntress se acercó al palacio de gobierno sigilosamente, al abrigo de la noche. El inmenso castillo permanecía silencioso y bien custodiado. Varios centinelas aguardaban, apostados en todos sus accesos. La Cazadora debió esperar hasta el cambio de guardia de uno de los destacamentos para actuar. Moviéndose a toda prisa pero con la sutilidad de un felino, utilizó uno de los viejos artilugios de su padre para escalar paredes. Mientras subía por el muro, trepándose, recordó cómo le habían dicho había sido construido aquél castillo… La comunidad misma lo había levantado, con sus propias manos. Tardaron cinco años en terminarlo. Cinco años de arduo trabajo duro. Cuando Helena supo esto, comprendió cuál era la relación entre la comuna y el misterioso Gobernador. -Es como un sistema feudal – le explicaría más tarde a Kara – El Gobernador les da sus órdenes y protección a cambio de ellos ser sus esclavos, como en la Edad Media. Castleville tan sólo es un enorme feudo y esta gente, la servidumbre. Volviendo al momento presente y mientras subía por el muro, Huntress sintió el mismo desagrado que aquella vez. Había gente muriéndose de una peste desconocida allá afuera y nadie hacía nada. El Gobernador estaba haciendo la vista gorda y Kara y ella descubrirían el motivo. -¿Por qué tardaste tanto? – le preguntó Supergirl. Estaba esperándola en la cima de la terraza, su capa roja ondeando al viento de la noche y su traje azul con la \"S\" en el pecho ajustado a su bello cuerpo. Helena se sobresaltó. -¡Kara, por Dios! – jadeó – ¡Casi me matas del susto! -Lo siento. Nos hubiéramos ahorrado todo esto si te llevaba volando conmigo… -Y yo ya te dije que volar no es una buena idea en la Ciudad, pero se ve que no entiendes – suspiró – No importa. Vamos. Por trabajar aquí, conozco dónde se encuentran las dependencias privadas del Gobernador. Aunque nunca entré ni me dejaron pasar, sé el camino. Entre las dos, entraron en el castillo y se dirigieron por un largo pasadizo hasta dar con una puerta enorme de madera. Tras ella, estaban las dependencias del Gobernador. -Él está ahí – le avisó Kara, rayos X mediantes – Está parado, bebiéndose un vino y mirando un cuadro mientras escucha música clásica de un gramófono. -Entonces, es hora de hacer nuestra entrada directa y triunfal – Helena sacó su pistola de flechas y la cargó – A la cuenta de tres: Una, dos… ¡Tres! ¡Vamos! De una patada conjunta, ambas derribaron la puerta y quedaron frente a frente con el Gobernador de Castleville. Al verlas, el hombre sonrió. -Bienvenidas. Las estaba esperando – dijo Vandal Savage.3 FIN DE LA SEGUNDA PARTE.

Basado libremente en \"Ciudad\" , de Ricardo Barreiro y J. Giménez) Resumen de la Segunda Parte : Atrapadas en la Ciudad –un lugar donde todo puede ser y donde todas las líneas de tiempo y todos los mundos paralelos se juntan– Kara y Helena acaban viviendo en Castleville, una comunidad aparentemente idílica pero que esconde un terrible secreto… Decididas a descubrirlo, las dos chicas vuelven a ser Supergirl y Huntress –la Cazadora– y se dirigen al palacio de gobierno para confrontar al amo secreto de Castleville: el villano inmortal Vandal Savage. 1 EL INMORTAL Vandal Savage era un hombre alto y fornido, de cabellos largos y de barba. Pese a estar vestido con prendas elegantes propias del siglo XIX y de lucir sereno y educado al hablar, algo de bestial, primitivo y básico se traslucía en él. Todo en su conjunto lo hacía parecer como un demonio contenido, capaz de las peores atrocidades cuando se las proponía. Al menos, eso es lo que Helena sabía sobre él. De hecho, de las dos, Huntress fue quien lo reconoció por lo que era: el más terrible de los villanos. -Vandal Savage – dijo, muy seria. El aludido sonrió e hizo una ligera inclinación a modo de reverencia. -¿Conoces a este tipo? – le preguntó Kara, desconcertada. -Sólo de oídas. En mi mundo, fue uno de los enemigos más grandes y terribles de la Sociedad de la Justicia… -Veo que mi fama me precede – dijo Savage, alzando su copa de vino – Sin embargo, tal y como yo lo veo, el Vandal Savage al que haces referencia debe ser una de mis infinitas contrapartidas esparcidas por el multiverso. Pero yo he oído hablar de ti, Huntress. Y de ti también, Supergirl. Me pareció gracioso cuando ambas llegaron a mi comunidad y pretendieron infiltrarse como si fueran gente normal. Pobres chicas tontas – meneó la cabeza – Estoy al tanto de todas las idas y venidas en Castleville. Si han llegado hasta aquí es porque yo lo permití. Silencio, sólo roto por la música del gramófono. Era un clásico de Beethoven. Savage entrecerró los ojos y lo disfrutó, hasta que decidió que era suficiente y sacó el disco, apagando el aparato. -Queremos respuestas, Savage – Huntress le apuntó con su pistola de flechas – Empieza a cantar ahora, o… -¿Qué? ¿Me mataran? – Vandal rió a carcajadas – Buen intento. Déjenme recordárselo, por si lo han olvidado: soy inmortal . Y creo que después de 25000 millones de años, nadie ha podido dañarme verdaderamente. Pero no se inquieten y siéntense – señaló a unos sillones – Tengo una historia que contarles… una crónica sobre mi llegada a la Ciudad y mi ascenso al poder. Tanto Supergirl como Huntress permanecieron de pie. Savage sonrió y se sentó en un cómodo sofá al lado de una chimenea encendida. -Año 1945. Fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. La Alemania nazi estaba prácticamente derrotada – comenzó – Por supuesto, yo estuve allí, como ya había estado con anterioridad en tantos lugares de importancia histórica sembrando el mal y el caos. A través de los tiempos, he estado en muchos lugares y he trabajado para muchas personas de renombre: Atila el Huno, el Genghis Khan, Napoleón Bonaparte, Vlad Tepes, el emperador romano Nerón, Hitler… De hecho, en este caso, estaba ejerciendo mi santo oficio en el Tercer Reich, ayudando al bueno de Adolf a aplastar a los Aliados y a exterminar judíos… hasta que Alemania perdió la guerra y todo se fue al carajo. Por supuesto, yo ya venía enfrentándome a la SJA, como desde hace siglos he venido enfrentando a todos los autoproclamados paladines del Bien que se han atrevido a cruzarse en mi camino. En este caso, la derrota de Hitler me obligó a abandonar precipitadamente Alemania en un avión. Savage hizo una pausa y bebió su vino. -Tenía planeado aterrizar en algún sitio de Europa, pero el destino intervino y acabé aquí, en este peculiar lugar, donde todos los mundos y todas las líneas de tiempo convergen. Y no estaba solo: más gente también había llegado, de diversos lugares. No me da vergüenza decir que mi nueva situación, si bien no deseable, pronto se convirtió en algo sumamente positivo – sonrió – Con la fuerza necesaria y la disciplina, pude organizarlos a todos y sacarlos adelante en una comunidad lógica y funcional. Así fue como Castleville nació… un oasis en medio del caos. Otra pausa. Las observó a ambas. -¿Entienden? De no ser por mí, este pueblo, esta comunidad no existirían… todos los ciudadanos de mi localidad me están infinitamente agradecidos por mi intercesión. -Sin duda, una actitud sumamente altruista de tu parte – se mofó Helena – Vamos, Savage. Puedes pretenderte todo lo civilizado que quieras, pero ya todos sabemos cómo eres. ¡Un monstruo! ¡Un auténtico y despiadado monstruo! Una bestia sanguinaria y sin corazón. ¡No hay un ápice de nobleza en ti! – lo señaló – ¡Has sumergido a todas estas personas en la más completa servidumbre! Son tus esclavos y tú, el amo. ¡Y no te importa un rábano lo que les pase! Así que no nos vengas con tus historias mentirosas de caridad y bien común. -Yo he impuesto el orden donde antes había caos – retrucó el inmortal – Todo el mundo lo sabe. Sin un jefe, estas personas estarían sacándose los ojos… tal es la naturaleza brutal del Homo Sapiens. -Tú no eres mejor, Savage – insistió Huntress – Te lo repito: sabemos la clase de monstruo que eres . Y también sabemos lo que intentas ocultar a estas personas… -¿Ah, sí? -Sí. ¡Hay una enfermedad suelta diezmando a la población! La gente de tu comuna perfecta está muriendo de una peste desconocida. ¡Y a ti te importa bien poco! -Humm – Savage se acabó su vino – En realidad, la peste a la que te refieres no es tan desconocida… tan sólo es una variedad mutante del cólera… Aunque tarda bastante en transmitirse, mata en cuestión de minutos. El inmortal se levantó de su asiento. Volvió a llenar su copa con vino. -Según estadísticas que manejo, hay unos cinco casos por día. Todos mortales y en aumento, por supuesto – sonrió – Lo más triste es que no existe remedio conocido. -Sí. Sí que lo hay – Huntress lo miró sombríamente – Si la gente se aleja del foco infeccioso, tendría una chance de salvarse. La vida comunitaria aumenta las probabilidades de contagio y favorece la expansión de la peste. Savage volvió a reír. A Kara se le encogió el corazón. Era la risa más perversa que había oído jamás en su vida. -¿Abandonar Castleville? ¿Volver a la Ciudad? No seas estúpida, querida. Mi gente ama el orden por sobre todas las cosas. El orden y la comunidad. Y tienen ambas cosas aquí en cuanto y en tanto sigan mis leyes y me reconozcan como su amo y señor. Son unas bonitas ovejas engordando, felices y contentas, sin preocupaciones. -No entiendo – Supergirl se animó a hablar – ¿Y tú qué ganas con esto? Tal y como yo lo veo, te sientas ahí a ver morir a la gente, sin importarte nada. -Es un sádico – Helena hizo una mueca – Forma toda una comunidad, les da techo, comida y esperanza a la gente y luego, las ve morir sin hacer nada para curarlos… porque a él no le afecta, puesto que es inmortal. -¿Qué esperaban? – Savage se encogió de hombros – Sólo me limito a actuar como el dios que soy. Sigo mi naturaleza, eso es todo. -Basura… -El creador de la Ciudad no es mejor que yo. Recuerden que él (o ellos) nos ha atrapado a todos por igual aquí y le importa bien poco nuestros sufrimientos, así que… -Se acabó, Savage – Huntress alzó su pistola – ¡Esta noche, tu régimen cae! -No, querida mía. Y te explico el motivo. Numero uno: no puedo morir. Esa flecha, una bala, una explosión atómica, da igual. No puedo morir, bajo ningún contexto, así que no pueden hacerme nada. Numero dos: suponiendo que puedan anularme, ¿Qué? La gente de Castleville no querrá irse. Les repito: estas personas aman el orden y la civilización . ¿Serían tan crueles de quitárselo? ¿Qué alternativa ofrecen? Hay miles de habitantes aquí, niños entre ellos. ¿Van a obligarlos a volver a la Ciudad, un lugar peligroso y caótico? Creo que la respuesta es \"no\" – bebió un nuevo sorbo de su vino – Ustedes dos son héroes. No harán nada que atente contra las vidas de estas personas… y lo mejor para ellas es quedarse donde están, conmigo a la cabeza. Silencio otra vez. Kara y Helena se miraron, desoladas y mortificadas por partes iguales. -Ahora ya lo saben – el inmortal suspiró, complacido – Tomen sus cosas y márchense de mi pueblo. Les doy mi palabra de que nadie las detendrá, pero váyanse de aquí, en este instante. Helena y Kara se marcharon de Castleville, como dos sombras en mitad de la noche. Las dos se sentían mal e impotentes. Pero les quedó claro que el maldito de Savage tenía razón: aunque lo dejaran expuesto, ni uno solo de los habitantes de la comunidad estaría dispuesto a abandonarla. Aquel lugar iba a convertirse en su seguro cementerio. Continuaron con su viaje por la Ciudad. Más adelante, les aguardaban nuevos peligros… y revelaciones. 2 EL TEMPLO Llovía en la Ciudad. Kara y Helena, que venían caminando por la calle, quedaron prácticamente empapadas por el diluvio. Intentaron buscar refugio en los edificios vecinos pero todos estaban prácticamente cerrados. Ya Supergirl se disponía a echar la puerta de uno de ellos abajo, abandonando todo rasgo de cortesía y decoro, cuando Helena la detuvo: -Ahí – dijo, señalando a un inmenso templo – Veo luces a través de sus ventanas. A lo mejor hay alguien que pueda ayudarnos. A medida que se acercaron, pudieron apreciar más rasgos del titánico edificio; tenía toda la pinta de una catedral colosal de alguna clase. Era como si quien la irguió hubiese decidido meter en un solo sitio todos los templos de adoración conocidos por el hombre… Con cierta reticencia, las dos muchachas tocaron a la puerta. Pasaron unos segundos hasta que alguien les abrió y les dirigió la palabra: -Entren, entren. Dentro estarán más seguras… Quién les había dicho esto era un misterioso monje encapuchado. Llevaba una antorcha encendida en su mano y se hizo a un lado, dejándolas entrar. Kara y Helena lo miraron con suspicacia. -Tranquilas, hijas mías – les dijo – No hay nada que temer. Aquí sólo vive gente permanentemente dedicada a lo sagrado… para nosotros, es un placer ser hospitalarios con los viajeros. -Gracias. La tormenta es muy fuerte – contestó Kara. Por sí las dudas y disimuladamente, se había parado frente a su amiga, para protegerla si surgía un imprevisto. -Síganme. Me imagino que estarán cansadas y hambrientas – el monje se volvió y echó a andar. Las dos chicas lo siguieron, resignándose. Si bien su experiencia en Castleville las había vuelto más desconfiadas y prudentes, reconocieron que el religioso tenía razón. La alternativa era volver afuera, a la tormenta y a la lluvia. -No conocía la existencia de una religión con estos símbolos – comentó Helena, cuando pasaron junto a un altar lleno de signos raros. -Es que nuestro culto es muy antiguo – les explicó el monje – El primero de todos… una religión primigenia que merece el honor de elevar un templo en la Ciudad Infinita. -¿Y a quién adoran? -A un dios tan viejo que ni siquiera pronunciamos su nombre – el monje las guió por un largo pasadizo lleno de columnas y de antorchas – No en vano, claro – hizo una pausa – Sois afortunadas… nos preparábamos para cenar. Sois bienvenidas a comer con nosotros. El pasadizo terminaba en una gran habitación, donde otros monjes igual de encapuchados aguardaban de pie ante una mesa repleta de comida. -Vaya – silbó Kara, ante tanta opulencia. -Sentaos, hijas, sentaos y comed – les dijeron, cordialmente. -Es todo un banquete – el estómago de Kara hizo ruido, casi a pesar de sí misma. Pero Helena frunció el ceño, desconfiada. -No quiero sonar grosera ni descortés, pero es mucha comida para gente que vive sólo de oraciones, rezos y plegarias. Los monjes se miraron. -Es que nuestro dios no nos prohíbe disfrutar de estos… placeres – respondió otro de ellos – Para nosotros, el comer y beber no es pecado. -Entiendo… pero, ¿no podríamos ver sus rostros, siquiera, antes de sentarnos a su mesa? Perdónenme, pero esas capuchas me ponen nerviosa. -Ningún problema – los monjes se despojaron de ellas. Todos (sin excepción) eran calvos y perfectamente normales. Su aspecto era totalmente humano – Si con esto contribuimos a su comodidad, bienvenido sea. Sin excusas ya a la vista, Kara y Helena se sentaron a la mesa y comenzaron a comer. Los monjes las imitaron y pasado un rato el clima en la habitación se distendió… Cuando la cena acabó, los monjes anunciaron que se marchaban a meditar a su santuario, pero que uno de ellos las acompañaría a sus habitaciones para pasar la noche. Kara y Helena lo siguieron hasta un cuarto bien cómodo, alumbrado por candelabros y velas encendidas y dos camas por separado. -Buenas noches, hijas – dijo el monje, al cerrar la puerta – Dormid bien… Cuando el religioso se hubo marchado, Helena se volvió hacia su compañera. -Aquí hay gato encerrado – le dijo. -Hel, lo mismo dijiste en Castleville… -¿Y no tuve razón, acaso? Estos monjes misteriosos esconden algo. Debemos averiguar de qué se trata. Kara suspiró. Miró con lastima su mullida cama. -Está bien – concedió – Vamos. Veamos qué oscuro secreto esconden nuestros anfitriones. Caminaron despacio por pasillos sumidos en penumbras, atentas a todo. De repente, un ruido las obligó a esconderse. Vieron una procesión de monjes avanzar, velas encendidas en mano, todos en fila. Decidieron seguirlos y no tardaron en llegar a un alucinante altar ubicado en la cima de una torre, un altar adornado por grotescas tallas de monstruos tentaculados y demonios cornudos. -¿Ves? Te lo dije – le susurró Helena a Kara. Ambas estaban escondidas entre las sombras – ¡Sabía que había algo malo en ellos! ¡Y mira! Hay una persona atada al altar… ¡Van a sacrificarla! -Dios mío… La victima del futuro sacrificio –una joven– yacía dormida, fuertemente amarrada por cadenas. Los monjes se habían quitado las capuchas y entonaban un cantico de alabanzas a su demoniaco dios. Uno de ellos –el líder de la ceremonia– esgrimía un bastón hecho de figuras retorcidas y coronado por una joya de color carmesí. -¡Ven a nosotros, oh, Yog-Sothoth! ¡Ven, Morador de Más Allá del Umbral y contempla con agrado la ofrenda roja que te entregamos! – canturreó – ¡Que se haga tu voluntad, así como en el principio, ahora y siempre, por los siglos de los siglos, amén! Otro monje se acercó a la chica, daga filosa en mano. Se hizo evidente su función cuando se dispuso a rebanarle el cuello. Nunca pudo hacerle daño. Moviéndose a supervelocidad, Kara la rescató y se la llevó de allí. Ante el desconcierto y el estupor general de los monjes, Helena salió de su escondite y les apuntó con un par de pistolas. -¡Quietos todos! – les dijo – ¡La ceremonia se ha terminado! -¡Infiel! ¿Cómo te atreves…? – el monje con el cetro lo blandió en el aire, como un arma - ¡Que la ira de Yog-Sothoth caiga sobre ti! Un rayo salió despedido de la joya carmesí. Iba a impactar en Helena, pero a último momento Supergirl la salvó al colocarse delante de ella y recibirlo de lleno. El rayo se reflectó en el cuerpo invulnerable de la chica kryptoniana y volvió a su punto de origen. El monje recibió la descarga y se desintegró en átomos, aullando. Aquello hizo que todos sus compañeros echaran a correr como locos, huyendo. El templo entero se sacudió. Afuera, hubo un trueno y luego, se hizo el silencio. -¿Estás bien? – le preguntó Helena. Kara resopló. -Ese rayo me hizo cosquillas. Vaya cosas… -¿Y la chica? -A salvo, pero apenas despertó, no se quedó donde la dejé. Salió corriendo fuera del templo y la perdí de vista. Iba a buscarla, pero entonces tuve que salvarte, Hel… -Maldición. -Al menos, la hemos rescatado de un destino peor. -Sí – Helena observó el lugar – Está visto que este sitio está consagrado al Mal y a la perdición. Vete a saber a cuánta gente han matado estos sádicos antes de que llegáramos. -¿Qué quieres hacer? -Lo único que podemos hacer: evitar que esto siga – Helena miró a las figuras retorcidas del altar – Lo de Castleville ha sido una lección que no podemos olvidar, Kara. No podemos simplemente mirar para otro lado y encogernos de hombros, como Vandal Savage. El Mal, con mayúscula, debe ser detenido. -Coincido contigo. -Derrumba este lugar. Minutos después, Supergirl destruyó los cimientos del templo con sus poderes. La colosal catedral consagrada a las deidades del Mal colapsó y se vino abajo, reduciéndose a cascotes y hormigón destruido. Las dos continuaron con su viaje por la Ciudad. La tormenta se había ido. La lluvia había cesado. 3 VIAJANDO EN EL METRO Estaban cansadas. Hartas y cansadas de tanto marchar a pie. Tal era así, que Helena estaba reviendo la prohibición que le había hecho a Kara de volar. Y de nuevo hacía un calor agobiante. Moverse entre aquellos solitarios rascacielos era igual a hacerlo dentro de un horno. El Sol abrasaba, casi derritiendo el asfalto, literalmente. -Nada… ni siquiera hay una mísera moto en esta calle – comentó, bebiéndose la poca reserva de agua de su cantimplora. -Hel, mira – Kara señaló a la boca abierta de una estación subterránea – ¿Y si probamos yendo allí? -Y vamos… perdido por perdido – Helena suspiró – Hace tanto calor aquí en la superficie, que me vendría bien algo de fresco. Ambas bajaron por las escaleras, hasta una terminal del metro. Efectivamente, allí se sintieron mejor. El aire era diferente, más fresco, húmedo y limpio. -Creo que lo mejor sería descansar aquí hasta que anochezca… es imposible seguir caminando bajo este Sol – dijo Kara, sentándose en un banco. -Eso, suponiendo que en este sector de la Ciudad existan los días y las noches – Helena hizo una pausa y miró a su amiga – Además, tú puedes soportar calor extremo. Eres invulnerable… -Yo sí, pero tú no – replicó la rubia, con una sonrisa – Y no voy a dejarte. Estamos juntas en esto y juntas vamos a salir de aquí. -Kara… para ya. No existe salida de la Ciudad, te lo he dicho miles de veces. Con suerte, estaremos atrapadas aquí todas nuestras vidas. -No puedes decir eso, Hel. Tiene que haber una salida. Ya verás. La encontraremos. Helena sonrió, con tristeza. -Kara, ¿Cuántos años tienes? Digo, en cifras terrestres. -Pues, creo que 25, si no le erró al cálculo. Pero no sé… mi biología corporal es… diferente. -Ya. Porque eres kryptoniana. -Y soy un clon, no lo olvides. Te he contado mi historia. -Cierto, pero me parece extraño eso de que te replicaran ya adulta y que no empezases siendo una niña. -Pregúntaselo a mi \"creador\" – Kara suspiró – Estábamos en mitad de una guerra contra Apokolips. Lex no necesitaba a una niña kryptoniana… necesitaba a alguien más grande, con sus poderes desarrollados.1 -¿Recuerdas algo de tu vida anterior? Digo, de la otra Kara Zor-El. -Poco y nada. Fragmentos. Sé que me dicen que yo soy lo que ella hubiera sido de vivir, pero… Kara se interrumpió. Un sonido insólito se dejó oír: el sonido del tren . El metro interrumpió en la estación ante la atónita vista de ambas y se paró. Estaba vacío, pero aun así sus puertas neumáticas se abrieron de par en par. -Creo que esta Ciudad nunca dejará de sorprenderme – comentó Helena – Me pregunto adónde llevara… -Creo saberlo, Hel – con cierta emoción, Kara estaba observando un mapa del recorrido empotrado en una pared – ¡Mira! Señaló un punto. Después de atravesar un largo trecho, el tren acababa en un sitio ubicado en el centro de la Ciudad, que decía simplemente \"SALIDA\". -¿Y? ¿Qué me dices? -Que no nos precipitemos. Puede ser una trampa. -O no, Hel. Si esto es verdad… si hay una mínima chance… Era imposible pedirle a Kara que se tranquilizara. Helena suspiró otra vez. Observó la puerta abierta del metro, esperándolas. -Suena demasiado fácil – reflexionó en voz alta – Pero está bien. No hay muchas opciones. Vamos. Las dos subieron al vacío tren. Las puertas se cerraron y entonces la maquina arrancó, iniciando su recorrido. El viaje fue tranquilo y sin contratiempos. Y largo. Mientras el tren avanzaba traqueteando por las vías, las dos chicas mataron el tiempo continuando con la charla iniciada en la terminal: -Yo tengo 30 y pico – dijo Helena, volviendo al tema de la edad – Más o menos, estoy en esa franja. -Mira tú. No te imaginaba tan vieja – Kara sonrió – ¿Te puedo decir \"abuelita\" ? -Muy graciosa. Lo cierto es que hace rato que vengo metida en esto de ser superhéroe… -Ya. Hija de Batman y de Catwoman. No debió ser fácil para ti. -Pues… un poco y un poco. Mamá se reformó antes de casarse con papá. Si me metí en esto, fue gracias a su apoyo. -¿Tu padre no quería? -Al principio, la idea no le hizo mucha gracia. Luego, aflojó. Y me entrenó. Fue una tarea ardua y muy dura… -Con buenos resultados. -Sí, creo que sí. Hice mi parte y combatí al crimen durante un tiempo. Entonces, vino la Crisis y… acabé aquí. -Que deprimente. ¿Extrañas a tus padres? -Muchísimo – Helena se emocionó – Por supuesto que los extraño y que quisiera volverlos a ver. Pero sé que eso es imposible. -¿Por qué? -Durante la Crisis, mi mundo fue destruido. Mi padre y también mi madre, todo lo que conocía, ha desaparecido. Todos han muerto. O peor: nunca han existido .2 Silencio. Kara sintió un profundo pesar por su amiga. -Al menos, tú tuviste padres – le dijo – Yo soy un clon. Y la Kara Zor-El original en la que me baso, fue enviada a la Tierra tras su primo siendo una bebé, así que… -Oye, cambiando de tema… ¿Por qué se fue el Superman de tu mundo? ¿Por qué los abandonó? -Ya te lo dije… no es que Kal-El nos abandonara. Es que lo que hizo en esa otra Tierra lo marcó profundamente. -Ya. Tuvo que matar, dijiste. Para evitar un mal mayor. -Tuvo que matar a un doble suyo. Tuvo que ser juez, jurado y verdugo, puesto que no había otra opción. Y por eso, decidió alejarse un tiempo de nosotros. -¿No sabes cuándo volverá? -No. Espero que sea pronto. Helena asintió. -Sí. El mundo necesita de más héroes como él – dijo – O como tú, para protegerlo. -Me temo que yo no soy ni la mitad de héroe que él es. -Tonterías. Tú eres una digna continuadora de su legado y me consta. Si alguien tiene que llevar el manto de la capa roja y la \"S\" en el pecho, esa eres tú. Eres bien digna. -Gracias por el voto de confianza, Hel – Kara sonrió. -De nada – Helena la imitó – ¿Para qué están las amigas? El tren se detuvo. Las puertas se abrieron. Habían llegado finalmente a su destino. 4 LA SALIDA Alguien las estaba esperando en el andén. Una atractiva chica pelirroja de mirada sexy. El estupor de Kara fue total, pues conocía a esa persona… y hasta donde sabía, estaba muerta. -¿Deborah? – exclamó – ¡No puede ser! Yo… ¡Te vi morir! La rubia comenzó a acercarse a la otra, pero Helena la detuvo. -Yo también la vi morir – le recordó – De modo que no puede ser ella. Deborah –o lo que sea que había asumido su aspecto– sonrió. -Muy perspicaz, Helena Wayne – dijo – Pensamos que esta interfaz sería apropiada para comunicarnos con Kara Zor-El. Conocemos los sentimientos que tenía hacia esta chica. -¿Quién eres? – preguntó la aludida – ¿Qué eres? -Sólo un emisario… enviado por los creadores de la Ciudad… -De modo que era cierto – dijo Helena – La Ciudad fue hecha por alguien. Y es más de uno. -Naturalmente – Deborah asintió – Por favor, síganme. Kara y su compañera fueron tras la aparición, no sin ciertos recelos. Subieron por las escaleras del subterráneo y emergieron al corazón de la Ciudad. Era una zona densamente poblada. Mucha gente caminaba por allí, seres de todas las clases, todos los tiempos y mundos. Para aumentar el desconcierto de la situación, todos se veían (y actuaban) pacíficamente. -Esto sí que es raro de verdad, aunque ya no me sorprende nada de este sitio – comentó Helena, cuando pasaron al lado de tres soldados pertenecientes a bandos opuestos y ninguno se estaba matando a los tiros. -En absoluto – replicó Deborah – Mantenemos a los habitantes tranquilos a propósito aquí, en el centro. Es una medida precautoria. Nos sirve para estudiarlos detenidamente a todos. -Queremos respuestas – dijo Kara, firme. Que aquella cosa hubiera usurpado la forma de su difunta amiga y vecina le caía mal… muy mal. -Lo sé. Pero no estoy autorizada a revelarles todos los secretos de la Ciudad. Apenas algo de información básica. -Pues empieza por hacerlo – la acicateó Helena – ¿Quién construyó este lugar? ¿Con qué fin? ¿Dónde está ubicado? -Los Constructores son viejos – Deborah suspiró – Muy viejos. Alguna vez fueron como ustedes. Seres de carne y sangre. Ahora, luego de eones de evolución cósmica, han trascendido la mortalidad y los lazos de la materia. Ellos hicieron este sitio por motivos y razones que no voy a revelarles. En cuanto a la pregunta de la ubicación exacta de la Ciudad, creí que eso les quedaba claro a ambas – alzó las manos, señalándolo todo – Este es el centro del multiverso. Todos los mundos posibles y todos los tiempos confluyen aquí, en el nexo. Este es el corazón de la Creación. Kara y Helena se miraron. Continuaron caminando entre la multitud de personas pacificadas, siguiendo a la muchacha pelirroja hacia un punto en concreto. -¿Es esto una especie de experimento? – preguntó Kara. -Tal vez – Deborah sonrió, enigmática – Los Constructores son curiosos. Están interesados en ustedes, los seres mortales. -Ellos… ¿Son Dios? – se animó a preguntarle Helena. Kara la miró, enarcando una ceja – ¿Qué? Alguien tenía que preguntarlo. -Ellos están más allá de ese concepto – contestó Deborah – Les sugiero no ahondar más en ello. No he sido programada para responder cuestiones de índole metafísica ni religiosa. Se detuvieron. Había un gran espacio vacío entre la multitud, donde se alzaba un único objeto: un bloque de hormigón con un ascensor empotrado dentro . -¿Qué es eso? -La salida. Helena arrugó la frente. -¿Es alguna broma? -No estoy programada para bromear. -¿Esa es la salida? ¿En serio? ¿La salida a la Ciudad? -Así es. -No tiene sentido – Helena observó a la multitud – Si esa es la salida, ¿por qué toda esta gente no la está usando? ¿Cómo es posible? -Porque ninguno tiene garantías de que sea la verdadera salida a la Ciudad – terció Deborah – Ninguna certeza. De modo que, ante la duda de que sea una trampa, nadie la usa. Pero es la salida – hizo una pausa – Si tuvieran suficiente confianza, la utilizarían. -¿Y nosotras, qué hacemos aquí? – preguntó Kara. -Tú quieres salir, Kara Zor-El. Tu arribo a la Ciudad no fue casual. Pudo parecerte que sí, pero no lo es. Los Constructores están interesados en los superhéroes… en especial, en Superman y los suyos. Ellos querían que vinieras aquí. Y ahora, ellos desean que vuelvas a la Tierra. -¿Por qué? ¿Por qué me trajeron aquí? -Las verdaderas razones y motivos sólo conciernen a los Constructores. Sólo se me permite decirte esto: puedes considerar tu paso por la Ciudad como un entrenamiento. -Un entrenamiento… ¿Para qué? -Para lo que está por venir. Deborah enmudeció. No agregó nada más. Kara temió preguntar al respecto, así que no lo hizo. -Todo esto me parece muy ambiguo – intervino Helena – Estos \"Constructores\", como los llamas, son demasiado misteriosos… y rebuscados. -…De modo que si entramos en ese ascensor, saldremos de la Ciudad… -No, Kara Zor-El. -Pero acabas de decir que esa es la salida… -Y lo es… pero sólo una persona puede cruzarla – la señaló – Tú. -Pero… ¿Y Helena? ¿Me estás diciendo que debo dejarla aquí? ¡De ningún modo! ¡Ella viene conmigo! -Lo lamento. No se puede. -¡No es justo! – Kara protestó, indignada. Helena le puso una mano en el hombro para tranquilizarla. -Calma. Creo entender los motivos – repuso. -¿Qué quieres decir, Hel? -Yo no tengo un mundo al que volver, recuerda. La Crisis destruyó mi Tierra. Por eso, no puedo ir contigo. -No. Helena, no voy a dejarte… no – los ojos de Kara se llenaron de lágrimas. Su amiga la abrazó con fuerza. -Debes ser valiente ahora – le recordó – Y debes subirte a ese ascensor. Tu mundo te necesita. Más que nunca. Ahora que Superman no está, tú tienes la responsabilidad de cuidarlo. -Oh, Hel… Voy a extrañarte. ¡No es justo! -Lo sé, nena, lo sé. Pero creo que en el fondo, ambas lo sabíamos – Helena le acarició el rostro – Ahora ve. Vuelve a casa y vive. Yo seguiré aquí. ¿Quién sabe? Tal vez llegue el día en que volvamos a vernos. Con todo el pesar y el dolor, Supergirl se separó de su amiga. Se miraron a los ojos por última vez y la rubia se dirigió hacia el ascensor. Había un solo botón. Sin vacilar, lo presionó. La puerta se abrió. -Los Constructores te desean suerte, Kara Zor-El – le dijo Deborah – La vas a necesitar. -Que se vayan al diablo – los insultó y entró en el cubículo. Antes de que la puerta se cerrara, vio el rostro de Helena, sonriendo. -Esa es mi chica – la escuchó decir – ¡Esa es la actitud! 6 VUELTA A CASA… Y UN NUEVO COMIENZO La puerta del ascensor volvió a abrirse. Kara parpadeó, sorprendida, mientras salía. Se hallaba en el Daily Planet. Reconoció el lugar: era el pasillo de las portadas de periódicos enmarcadas en cuadros. ¡Había vuelto no sólo a casa, sino que hacia atrás, en el tiempo! Estaba en el momento justo en que Perry White la contrataba para trabajar en el diario. Y allí venia el editor, fumándose su habano, deteniéndose frente a ella y mirando los cuadros… -¿Sabes por qué está eso colgado en la pared? – le preguntó. Kara vaciló. De inmediato, recordó lo que ella le había contestado: -¿Por qué si estuviera en el suelo se correría la tinta? -Que simpática – White suspiró y luego se largó a su discurso explicativo del motivo de enmarcar esas noticias. Kara no lo escuchó. Su mente iba por otros lados, analizando otras cuestiones. Los Constructores de la Ciudad la habían devuelto al inicio de todo, a su intento por seguir los pasos de su primo y forjarse un lugar en Metrópolis. Esto dejaba claro dos cosas… La más evidente, que los Constructores eran terriblemente poderosos. Seres capaces de manipular –incluso, jugar– con el tapiz del tiempo y del espacio no le merecían ninguna confianza. Le hablaron veladamente de cierta amenaza que se acercaba y que su paso por la Ciudad fue para ella una especie de entrenamiento para combatirla. ¿Y si ellos eran la amenaza? ¿Y si ahora decidían meter mano en la Tierra? ¿Entonces? La segunda cosa evidente para ella era que esta vez, sabía a lo que se enfrentaba. Y que no podía seguir actuando ni a la ligera ni ingenuamente. De modo que labrarse una vida como Kal-El era un error. Estaba allí emulando a su primo, siguiendo sus pasos. Era su oportunidad de cambiar. De forjar su propio camino. Su propio destino. Era tiempo de crecer. -…Lo que pretendo de mi personal es que salga a la calle, a buscar la noticia. No quedarse sentados en la redacción, haciendo trabajo de oficina – continuaba White – ¿Crees poder cumplir con estos requisitos? -¿La verdad? No, Sr. White. -¿Eh? -Que no. Lo he pensado muy bien y se lo agradezco, pero no quiero el trabajo de periodista. No va conmigo – Kara le estrechó la mano – Gracias. Gracias de verdad. Se marchó. Perry la observó irse, pasmado. -¡Por las patillas de Elvis! No entiendo nada – se quejó – ¿Acaso se volvió loca? Pero Kara no estaba loca. Tenía un objetivo bien claro. En los días siguientes, visitó las principales bibliotecas del mundo. Leyó todos los libros que tuvo a su alcance, de los más variados temas. Su mente kryptoniana procesó la información a una velocidad pasmosa. Cuando el tour cultural acabó, Kara surgió más sabia y más adulta de lo que había sido. Volvió a la granja Kent, donde se reencontró con Superboy. Le contó toda la historia de su estancia en la Ciudad y sus planes de forjar su propio camino como superheroina defensora de la Tierra. -Hay que aceptar lo evidente, Conner – le dijo, mientras trabajaba velozmente en la confección de un nuevo traje – Kal-El se ha ido. Puede que para siempre. Él ha tomado su decisión, su camino. Yo debo tomar el mío. -Kara, me asustas – Conner la observó, serio – Cualquiera diría que eres otra… -Soy otra – corroboró ella – Mi paso por la Ciudad me cambió. Me hizo reflexionar que ser una mujer sensible y delicada no va a llevarme a ningún lado. Cuando eres así y tienes los poderes que tengo, cometes errores. La gente inocente muere por culpa de esos errores – negó con la cabeza – No. Ya no puedo permitirme el lujo de ser débil ni sensible. No con una gran amenaza en puerta. Tengo que ser enérgica y adulta, decidida. Como lo era mi amiga Helena. -¿Qué estás haciendo? -Confeccionado un nuevo uniforme para mí – le explicó, dándole los últimos toques – \"Supergirl\" es historia. Se veía como un apéndice de Kal-El. Yo no soy apéndice de nadie. Kara se retiró a su cuarto para cambiarse. Cuando volvió, Conner se quedó con la boca abierta. -¿Y bien? – preguntó la chica. Vestía un traje blanco bien escotado y ajustado a su cuerpo, más una capa roja de un estilo diferente a la anterior. La clásica \"S\" no se veía por ningún lado. -Todo un cambio – Conner silbó. No había reparado en lo salvajemente sexy que se veía Kara hasta ese momento. ¡Si hasta físicamente parecía más adulta, con ese uniforme! – ¿Y cómo debo llamarte a partir de ahora? Ella lo pensó un momento. Luego, sonrió con decisión y seguridad al responder: -Desde hoy en adelante, seré… ¡POWER GIRL! EL PRINCIPIO… 1 Ver \"Superman: Earth-2\" para más información. 2 Helena hace referencia a la Crisis en las Tierras Infinitas. Casualmente –o no tanto– ese hecho de suma importancia cósmica para el Universo DC marcó el final (al menos, por un tiempo) de la versión de la Edad de Plata de Huntress . ","Summary":" SUPERGIRL: LA CIUDAD INFINITA Parte Tres (Escrito por Federico H. Bravo. Basado libremente en \"Ciu"},{"Movie":"Supergirl","Title":"Supergirl: La Ciudad Infinita (Parte Uno)","Author":"Federico H. Bravo","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11397166","Passage":"[Chapter 1] SUPERGIRL: LA CIUDAD INFINITA Parte Uno (Escrito por Federico H. Bravo. Basado libremente en \"Ciudad\" , de Ricardo Barreiro y J. Giménez) Nota del Autor : Dos cosas a tener en cuenta. La primera, que Kara Zor-El debutó en mi fanfic \"Last Son of Krypton\" , encontrando allí mismo la muerte de manera trágica a manos del alienígena Brainiac. Pese a que parecía el final total del personaje, decidí traerla de vuelta al ruedo y para ello recurrí tanto a la clonación como a mundos paralelos. La Kara Zor-El que van a encontrar en esta historia es un duplicado de la anterior y es, quizás, lo que aquella Kara debería haber sido, si Brainiac no la hubiese matado. La segunda cosa a tener en cuenta es que esta historia transcurre luego de otra de Superman, titulada \"Exilio\" , un relato corto donde el Hombre de Acero –agobiado por la culpa de los actos por él cometidos en \"Earth-2\", un universo alternativo donde tuvo que enfrentarse con una versión malévola de sí mismo– partió rumbo a lo profundo del espacio, sin dar una fecha aproximada de su retorno. Superman se ha ido… de modo que ahora otros deberán defender la Tierra. Entre ellos, la misma Supergirl. 1 KAREN STAR Metrópolis. Daily Planet. Kara observaba con suma atención la portada del periódico enmarcada en un cuadro. Estaba colgada en el pasillo de entrada a la redacción. Era una imagen de Kal-El, su primo, vistiendo el traje de Superman. Encima de él con letras grandes, el siguiente titular: \"MISTERIOSO SUPERHOMBRE SALVA AL MUNDO\". La chica sonrió. Sin duda, aquél hecho fue uno de los primeros en la –hasta el momento– larga carrera heroica de Clark. El primero digno de mención en los titulares del gran periódico metropolitano. -¿Sabes por qué está eso colgado en la pared? – le preguntó alguien. Kara se volvió, encontrándose cara a cara con el editor en jefe, Perry White. -¿Perdone…? -He preguntado si sabes por qué eso está en la pared – repitió Perry, fumándose un habano. -Oh… bueno… ¿Porque si estuviera en el suelo se correría la tinta? -Que simpática – White suspiró – Mucha gente piensa que cuelgo sus artículos enmarcados para conmemorar los puntos álgidos de la historia del periódico – señaló al pasillo – Si te fijas bien, veras un montón de otras portadas similares. Todas enmarcadas. -Es verdad. -Hago esto en realidad para dejar claro que son noticias viejas – le explicó – Congeladas en el tiempo. Muertas – hizo una pausa y miró la portada del periódico donde salía Superman – Momificadas tras el cristal, como… como… humm… -¿Mariposas clavadas en un corcho? – completó Kara, tímidamente. -Eso es – Perry sonrió y fumó su habano – Noticias antiguas, en fin. Lo que quiero decir es que este periódico siempre les ha ofrecido a sus lectores noticias nuevas y frescas todas las mañanas y eso es lo que pretendo de mi personal, así como lo pretendía mi antecesor, el señor George Taylor. No que se queden a hacer trabajo de oficina. Que salgan a la calle y que busquen la novedad. ¿Crees poder cumplir con ese requisito? -Desde luego, Sr. White. Pondré todo mi empeño en ello. -Más te vale. He estado revisando tu currículo… Bastante impecable. Voy a pensar que Kansas es un semillero de estrellas en franco ascenso. Primero tu primo Clark, luego Chloe Sullivan (la prima de Lois) y ahora, tú. ¿Qué tiene Smallville de particular, eh? Kara sólo se limitó a sonreír, sin decir nada. Por supuesto, el currículo y todos sus papeles –así como documentación y demás– eran falsos. Un favor de la oficina administrativa de la Liga de la Justicia, cuya burocracia les permitía estas facilidades beneficiosas a los miembros inscriptos en su base de datos. -Bueno, señorita Karen Star… oficialmente, le doy la bienvenida a la gran familia del Planet – Perry le estrechó la mano – Comienza ya mismo a trabajar con nosotros. 2 VECINOS Poco tiempo después… La zona de la ciudad no era de las mejores, pero para Kara bastaba. En realidad, no quería llamar demasiado la atención, ahora que se había mudado a Metrópolis, de modo que aquel apartamento que le estaban mostrando le venía como anillo al dedo: era grande y espacioso. Algo húmedo y con la pintura descascarada en las esquinas, pero nada que una buena mano de trabajo no pudiera arreglar. Ayudaba tener superpoderes y moverse más rápido que una bala o una locomotora. -En la parte alta de la ciudad hay sitios más bonitos, pero el precio es otra cosa – le decía el casero, un hombre mayor dueño de una barba muy poblada – Y en la parte más baja… créame, señorita: no querrá pasarse por ahí . -Ya – Kara depositó el enorme bolso con sus pertenencias en el sofá. Luego se sentó ella misma. Era relativamente cómodo – ¿Los muebles están incluidos? -Por 20 dólares más al mes, sí. -Bien… entonces, supongo que acepto. Kara y el hombre se dieron la mano. -Bienvenida al edificio, Srta. Star. -Karen. -Karen, entonces – el anciano sonrió – Soy el Sr. Setrakian. Vivo en el primer piso. Si necesita algo, dígamelo. -Ok. -¿Cuándo piensa mudarse? Kara sonrió. -Ya lo he hecho. Esa misma noche, cuando Kara volvía del trabajo en el Planet –y de hacer las compras en el supermercado– conoció a dos de sus vecinos en el edificio. El primero estaba sentado en la escalera de entrada. Era un triste muchacho de aspecto algo desaliñado pero buenas intenciones. Dijo llamarse Eddie y le dio la bienvenida a su particular estilo lánguido. Kara sintió lastima por él. Era evidente que tenía problemas con la bebida. Por lo demás, parecía un tipo inofensivo. Cuando la chica subió a su apartamento y comenzó a llenar con alimentos su despensa y nevera, conoció al segundo… -¿Sí? – preguntó, abriendo la puerta ante el insistente toque del timbre. De inmediato se quedó sin habla. Una pelirroja impactante le devolvió la mirada, apoyada de manera muy sexy en el pasillo. -Debes ser una chica muy valiente, como para abrir así nomas la puerta sin mirar primero quién es – la muchacha le sonrió – ¿Me invitas a pasar? -Yo… er… ¡Sí! Claro… es decir… -Gracias – la pelirroja no esperó y directamente entró, mirando todo el lugar – Hey… veo que estuviste acomodando un poco el sitio. No está nada mal – se volvió hacia ella y le estrechó la mano – Deborah Watters. Vivo en el 2-B. -Oh. Soy Karen… Karen Star. 2-A. Se hizo un incómodo silencio. Incómodo para Kara. Deborah no dejaba de mirarla con un inusitado y alarmante interés. -El Sr. Setrakian dice que eres reportera… -Sí, bueno, ya sabes… estoy empezando, je. Trabajo en el Planet. -¿De veras? -Sí. -¡Qué bien! Me encanta ese periódico. Es muy bueno – Deborah se sentó en el sofá. Kara parpadeó, sorprendida de tanta confianza por parte de la recién llegada – Tuve un novio que era periodista, ¿sabes? -¿Ah, sí? -Sí, pero no era bueno… lo echaron a los dos meses. -Cuanto lo siento. -Yo no. Era todo un perdedor. Por eso lo dejé – suspiró – Creo que se te derrite. -¿Qué? -El postre helado que tienes en la mano… se va a derretir si no lo pones en la nevera, ¿sabes? -¡Oh! – Kara se dio cuenta que había salido de su cocina con el helado en la mano. Sonrió tontamente – Vaya despiste, je. -No pasa nada – la siguiente sonrisa que Deborah le dedicó fue más amplia – En fin – se puso de pie – Sólo pasaba a saludarte y conocerte… y a ver si querías ir al cine conmigo. -¿Al cine? -Están dando esa peli de los Avengers … dicen que es buenísima. ¿Quieres venir conmigo a verla? -Pues… yo… -¡Vamos! Será una salida de chicas. Luego iremos a por una pizza. Conozco el mejor lugar de toda la ciudad donde la hacen riquísima. ¿Qué dices? ¿Te apuntas? -Bueno… ¿Por qué no? -¡Bárbaro! – Deborah le depositó un beso en la mejilla antes de salir del apartamento – Nos vemos el sábado, entonces. ¡Noche de pelis y de pizza! Hasta luego, preciosa. Kara cerró la puerta y se apoyó de espaldas a ella. Se había sonrojado bastante. Sonrió. -Bueno… miren nada más… que cosas – suspiró. Miró el helado – Vaya. Tenía razón. ¡Se derritió! Diablos. 3 PERDIDOS EN LA CIUDAD Sábado. A la salida de un cine. Al término de la función, Kara y Deborah salieron juntas, charlando sobre la película que habían visto: -No sé… muchos destrozos y efectos especiales – dijo Kara – O sea… sé que es una película de superhéroes, pero me pareció exagerada. Deborah sonrió. Seguía mirándola de aquella peculiar forma suya, mezcla de ternura y autentico interés sexual. -Oye, no te lo pregunté todavía hasta ahora, pero… ¿de dónde eres? -Ah. Smallville, Kansas. -Humm… No me suena para nada. -Es un pueblito chico, muy pintoresco. Un sitio tranquilo. -¿En serio? ¿Existe un lugar así? – Deborah rió – Me encantaría conocerlo algún día. Digo, si es tan idílico como parece serlo por tu tono de voz cuando hablas de él, entonces vale la pena conocerlo. Silencio. Las dos chicas se miraron a los ojos. Kara volvió a sentirse un poco incomoda, aunque la sensación iba rápidamente desapareciendo. No sabía decir todavía si eso era bueno o no. -En fin – Deborah miró a la noche y a la ciudad – Lo prometido es deuda: ¡Vamos por la pizza! Agarró a Kara del brazo y ambas comenzaron a marchar hacia el negocio. -Conozco un atajo para llegar más rápido – le dijo Deborah. Kara y ella torcieron por un oscuro callejón. Continuaron caminando hasta emerger en una solitaria avenida deslustrada. Cuando luego de un rato largo de marchar la pelirroja frunció el ceño, Kara supo que algo no iba bien. -¿Qué pasa? – le preguntó. -Es extraño… -¿El qué? -No conozco esta parte del barrio – Deborah se detuvo en una esquina – Se supone que la pizzería debería estar por aquí… humm… Kara le echó un vistazo al paisaje. Los edificios que las rodeaban se veían lúgubres, oscuros. \" Qué raro\" , pensó, \"Si no supiera que es imposible, diría que esto es Gotham City, más que Metrópolis.\" -Nunca había visto esta calle – Deborah señaló un letrero – \"Av. El Aleph\" – hizo una mueca – ¿Te suena? -¿Debería? No te olvides de que prácticamente, soy nueva en Metrópolis, así que… Continuaron caminando varias calles más hasta que se hizo evidente para ambas de que se habían perdido. -Esto es bien bizarro – Deborah rió, nerviosa – Juro que esto nunca me había pasado antes. ¡Y hoy no he bebido alcohol! No sé bien qué está pasando, pero… -Espera un momento – Kara se detuvo, seria – Mira eso. -¿Qué cosa? -Esa tienda de ahí. -¿Qué tiene? -¡Está saqueada! Fíjate. Las dos mujeres se acercaron. Era cierto: la tienda se hallaba completamente en ruinas. Con los vidrios hechos pedazos, producto sin duda de un acto vandálico. Y no era la única… mirando por toda la desierta avenida, Kara y su compañera vieron más negocios destrozados. Había más vidrios rotos, persianas levantadas y rastros de una huida precipitada. La basura se acumulaba en el piso y el panorama general era desolador. Se parecía más a una zona de guerra que a una autentica ciudad. -Karen… ¿Qué está pasando aquí? – Deborah se pegó a ella – Esto… no es normal – la pelirroja temblaba. -Nadie – comentó la rubia, mirando hacia todas partes – No se ve ni un alma… Ambas se pararon en mitad de la calle. La avenida estaba totalmente desierta. -¡No puede ser! – exclamó Deborah – ¿Qué está pasando? -Volvamos sobre nuestros pasos – sugirió Kara. Las dos comenzaron a retroceder rápidamente, con el corazón latiéndoles a mil en el pecho. De repente, se encendieron las luces de un auto estacionado. Deborah suspiró, aliviada. -¡Al fin, alguien! – se adelantó, sonriendo, acercándose al coche – Espera aquí, Karen. Iré a preguntarles si saben qué rayos está pasando… -¡Deborah! ¡Cuidado! Kara había visto bien al automóvil: no era normal. Se trataba de un vehículo blindado, con una torreta encima. En ella, iba un sujeto con la cara pintada como un militar se pintaría para camuflarse en medio de una jungla, sentado tras una impresionante ametralladora tamaño gigante. Sin mediar palabra, abrió fuego descargando una andanada de tiros sobre la pobre Deborah, cosiéndola a balazos. Paralizada por la sorpresa y el estupor, Kara no llegó a salvarla de aquella horrible muerte. Pero no importaba: ella era la siguiente . Moviendo el cañón de la ametralladora, el hombre de la torreta sobre el auto la emprendió contra ella. Como no podía ser de otra forma, la lluvia de balas la fustigó sin causarle el menor daño. Todos los tiros rebotaron contra su piel kryptoniana invulnerable, limitándose a desgarrarle la ropa, nada más. Antes de que el \"loco de la ametralladora\" pudiera recargarla siquiera, una flecha cruzó el aire y se le clavó en el pecho. El tipo se desplomó fulminado, mientras el conductor del auto blindado volvía a ponerlo en marcha e intentaba arrollar a Kara. Supergirl no lo esquivó. Lo embistió con todas sus fuerzas y lo revoleó por el aire, estrellándolo contra el asfalto. El coche se hizo pedazos y su conductor salió de él arrastrándose. Era sin duda una especie de soldado; llevaba parte de un uniforme militar desgarrado. Le echó un vistazo a Kara y huyó corriendo. -Deborah – con los ojos llenos de lágrimas, Supergirl abrazó el cadáver de la pelirroja – Lo siento… lo siento mucho… -Ya es tarde para tu amiga – le dijo una voz a sus espaldas – También lo será para ti si no te mueves y vienes conmigo. Kara se volvió. Una chica se hallaba parada a su lado. Una chica vestida con un curioso traje de superheroina, con mascara cubriéndole el rostro y todo. Le tendía amistosamente una mano. -Soy Huntress – se presentó – Bienvenida a La Ciudad. 4 HELENA Huntress condujo a Kara al interior de un edificio de apartamentos cercano. Cerró a espaldas de ambas una puerta reforzada por planchas de acero y la condujo escaleras arriba, hacia el sitio al que llamó \"su vivienda\" . Supergirl aprovechó todo el trayecto para explorar con su visión de rayos X el lugar: aparte de ellas dos, el edificio estaba totalmente vacío. -Siéntate mientras cierro la puerta – le dijo la misteriosa justiciera enmascarada, una vez que ambas estuvieron en su apartamento. El sitio se veía deprimente. Más que una vivienda propiamente dicha, cumplía la función de alojamiento temporal. Había sillones, algunos muebles y colchones en el piso, eso sí. Y armas de fuego, de todos los tipos y tamaños. -No comprendo nada de lo que está sucediendo – confesó Kara, derrumbándose en un sofá – Todo esto tiene que ser una pesadilla… hace pocas horas, Deborah y yo salíamos del cine. -Me imagino que entonces habrán tomado algún atajo para el sitio al que iban – Huntress suspiró – ¿Eso es correcto? -Sí. Así fue. -Lo normal. Han entrado sin querer en una bifurcación dimensional… y eso las trajo a La Ciudad. -Sigo sin comprender nada de nada. ¿Qué lugar es este? ¿Dónde estamos? -Ya te lo dije: en La Ciudad . -¿Qué ciudad? Esto no es Metrópolis. -No. Esta parte es más bien similar a Gotham. Pero aun eso es relativo… Para mí, este rincón es lo más parecido a mi hogar natal: oscuro, sórdido, violento y lleno de criminales. Huntress se quitó la máscara. Kara pudo ver que se trataba de una atractiva chica de cabellos negros y rasgos un tanto felinos. -La Ciudad es un sitio fantástico – continuó explicando, mientras se sacaba también la capa – Una urbe monstruosa, infinita y sin nombre, donde todo puede ser y donde tienen cabida diferentes periodos de tiempo… y sus correspondientes habitantes. No voy a mentirte: aquí hay de todo . Hombres, mujeres… alienígenas – hizo una pausa y la miró – Eres kryptoniana, ¿verdad? -¿Cómo lo has sabido? -Por dos motivos. El primero, el más evidente, vi cómo las balas rebotaban en tu cuerpo sin causarte daño. El segundo, digamos que mi padre ha tenido experiencias con kryptonianos a lo largo de su carrera heroica. Y esa \"S\" que se asoma en tu pecho a través de tu ropa desgarrada es, sin lugar a dudas, el símbolo de la Casa de El. Kara estaba maravillada. Le costó volver a hablar, pero tenía que hacerlo. Tenía que saber más… -¿Quién eres? -Mi nombre es Helena Wayne – le chica sonrió con tristeza – Soy hija de Batman y de Catwoman. Pasada la sorpresa inicial y el impacto que supuso conocer la identidad de su actual compañera de desgracias, Kara escuchó de su boca toda su historia. Helena, como dijo, había nacido de la unión del Caballero de la Noche y de la astuta criminal salta-techos. Cuando contó con edad suficiente, su padre –con el apoyo de su reformada madre– la entrenó para convertirla en una especie de sucesora suya. \"Huntress\" , la Cazadora, era en quien se convertía cuando se ponía aquel traje. De civil, tan sólo era Helena Wayne, la hija de uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo y heredera de una fastuosa fortuna. -Pero… Yo conozco a Batman – intervino Kara – y él no tiene hijos. -No el de la Tierra de dónde vienes. En la mía, sí los ha tenido. Al menos, me tuvo a mí. No conozco a otros – Helena volvió a sonreír con tristeza. -Entonces… ¿Vienes de un mundo paralelo? -Muy pronto aprenderás que en La Ciudad, todos los mundos paralelos y todas las líneas alternativas de tiempo se juntan. Aquí, la gran mayoría proviene de alguno de los universos que conforman el gran multiverso infinito. -Suena aterrador. -Ya puedes creerlo: lo es. -¿Y cómo llegaste aquí? Helena volvió a suspirar. -Es una historia algo larga y complicada. Resumiéndotela, digamos que acabé aquí después de atravesar una Crisis Cósmica.1 Se hizo el silencio, mientras Supergirl procesaba a su manera toda la información que había recibido. -Okey. ¿Cómo salimos de aquí? – preguntó. -¿A qué te refieres? -De esta ciudad. -No se puede. -¿Cómo que no se puede? -No se puede. Llevo bastante tiempo intentándolo. Nadie puede abandonar La Ciudad una vez cae en ella. Al menos, no vivo. Este sitio es como el infierno. El sonido de un disparo resonó en el apartamento. Una bala perforadora atravesó una pared y acabó estrellándose contra la otra esquina del cuarto. Helena rodó por el piso y tomó un fusil. A través de una rendija en una ventana tapiada, espió el exterior y luego abrió fuego. Se escuchó un grito ahogado, el sonido de varias botas taconeando el asfalto y después todo volvió a quedar en silencio. -Hijos de puta… – masculló. -¿Qué ha sido eso? -Los soldados. Son un grupo de guerrilleros colombianos que se deben haber perdido en medio de la jungla y que han venido a parar aquí – le explicó – Están ahí fuera. Nunca me perdonaran haber matado a su compañero. Este sitio dejó de ser seguro. -¿Y entonces? -Entonces, nos movemos – Helena tomó un bolso. Comenzó a llenarlo con armas – Debemos dejar este sitio. Puesto que estas atrapada aquí en La Ciudad conmigo, te sugiero que me acompañes. Tal vez tengamos suerte y encontremos un sitio mejor. -Todo esto es una locura, pero veo que no tengo elección… iré contigo. Kara se quitó sus ropas desgarradas por el tiroteo. El traje rojo y azul de Supergirl quedó a la vista. -Mi verdadero nombre es Kara Zor-El – dijo, a modo de presentación – Soy la prima de Superman. -De nuevo, Kara: bienvenida a La Ciudad – Helena le estrechó la mano y luego se ajustó su máscara en el rostro, convirtiéndose en Huntress – Vamos. 5 VISTA PANORAMICA Caminaron durante al menos tres horas, moviéndose sigilosamente entre las sombras del lugar. Kara se sintió medio estúpida: podía volar y con eso, acortar el viaje considerablemente, pero Helena se lo desaconsejó. -Si vuelas, lo único que vas a obtener es atención de más sobre ti – le explicó – Créeme: en La Ciudad, tú no querrás llamar la atención de nadie… ni de nada. -¿Nunca has intentado escapar…? ¿Encontrar una salida? -Ya te lo dije: no se puede salir de aquí . Pero, contestando a tu pregunta, desde que llegué trato de hallarla. -¿Y? -No la hay. De modo que intento sobrevivir como puedo a duras penas – Helena suspiró – No es fácil; La Ciudad es un laberinto infernal… -¡Pero tiene que existir una salida! – insistió Kara, desesperada – Un camino me trajo hasta aquí. ¡Otro podría sacarnos a ambas! -Eres joven, Kara. Incluso, veo que unos años menor que yo – Helena sonrió con tristeza – Supongo que, mientras la esperanza viva, uno vive con ella. Habían llegado a una esquina. El sitio seguía luciendo exactamente igual: vacío y desolado. Sin embargo, algo estaba cambiando. Por el horizonte, el Sol comenzaba a salir. -Es extraño – comentó Kara – Ya amanece. Cuando estaba en mi mundo, la noche recién había empezado. ¡No puede haber pasado mucho tiempo! -Este sitio haría las delicias de Einstein. El tiempo –así como la duración de los días y de las noches– es relativo aquí. Este lugar se ve como la Tierra, pero no lo es. Kara frunció el ceño. -Tengo que calcular hasta dónde llega esta pesadilla – dijo. -¿Qué? -Lo siento, Helena. Sé que me habías dicho que no volara, pero ahora que está amaneciendo, necesito obtener una vista panorámica de este sitio. Y la única manera es… elevándome en el aire. -Sigo insistiendo en que es muy mala idea, pero lo vas a hacer igual, así que adelante – se sentó en las escaleras a la entrada de una casa – Aquí te espero. Sólo que no te tardes demasiado ni te alejes mucho, ¿vale? -Ok. Libre como un pájaro, Kara se alzó hacia el cielo del amanecer. Subió y subió, hasta que consideró que había llegado a una altura aceptable. Entonces dirigió sus ojos hacia el horizonte… Pasmada, descubrió que la ciudad seguía extendiéndose hasta el infinito. La luz solar facilitaba la visión del sitio, lo mismo que la falta de smog y de polución. -No puede ser – dijo, asombrada – No puede ser… Utilizó su visión telescópica. Fue inútil: mirase donde mirase, tan sólo veía edificios de acero y hormigón. Rascacielos modernos y otras estructuras. Y todo, sin un final aparente. Helena seguía en el mismo sitio cuando volvió a bajar. La Cazadora se dio cuenta del desencanto en las facciones de su nueva amiga y le apoyó una mano en el hombro, conteniéndola. -Animo – le dijo – Vamos. Tenemos que continuar. Ambas no tardaron en reanudar la marcha. 6 EL SUPERMERCADO DEL FUTURO Convencida de lo permanente de su situación, Kara intentó amoldarse a su nuevo entorno, manteniendo viva la esperanza de hallar (algún día) una salida de la maldita Ciudad. Habiendo avanzado junto a Helena hacia zonas más luminosas de la urbe, llegó a la conclusión de que Supergirl estaba de más en un sitio como aquel. Se lo planteó a su compañera y ella también estuvo de acuerdo en que Huntress podía tomarse unas vacaciones. De modo que en la primera tienda de ropa femenina que hallaron, ambas cambiaron de prendas por otras de civil y guardaron discretamente en sendos bolsos sus trajes de superheroinas. Además, encontraron un vehículo para poderse desplazar mejor que a pie: un Hummer, guardado en un garaje con las llaves puestas y el tanque lleno. Con él, recorrieron más kilómetros de la interminable ciudad, buscando algún sitio con alimentos y provisiones. -Nada – resopló Helena, al volante – Esta zona parece ser meramente residencial… no se ve ninguna tienda. -Tranquila, Hel – Kara observaba todo, los supersentidos alerta – Tengo cubierto todo. Y ahí está la respuesta a nuestras plegarias – señaló a un gigantesco edificio, un bloque de hormigón sin adornos, con un amplio estacionamiento al frente. -Madre de Dios – Helena silbó, deteniendo el vehículo – ¿Es un supermercado? ¿Cómo lo sabes? -Visión de rayos X. ¿Recuerdas? -Cierto… y es bien grande. Creo que encontraremos todo lo que buscamos ahí dentro. Ambas bajaron del Hummer y se acercaron con cuidado a la puerta. La entrada –una puerta de acero puro– permanecía cerrada. Por su aspecto, parecía inviolable. -Creo que este es un trabajo para… - Kara, quien se disponía a abrirse paso a golpes de puño, no acabó de completar la frase. La puerta se abrió automáticamente, permitiéndoles entrar a un lugar salido de una historia fantástica de ciencia-ficción. -¿Qué es esto? ¿El supermercado del futuro? – bromeó Helena, mientras recorrían sus góndolas cargadas de alimentos. Ella sabía perfectamente que aquél sitio bien podía provenir del futuro distante de la Tierra… -Increíble. Todo está perfectamente ordenado… no hay ni una mota de polvo – comentó Kara – Este sitio debe ser auto-limpiante, sin duda. Este supermercado viene del siglo XXX, el hogar de mi amigo Conner.2 -Siglo XXXI – dijo una voz a sus espaldas. Ambas chicas se volvieron, enfrentándose a un curioso androide de color blanco, igual de inmaculado como todo en aquél lugar. -¿Qué? -Siglo XXXI – volvió a corregir el robot educadamente, en un perfecto inglés – Señoritas, ¡bienvenidas al Hiper-Market! Soy Alpha-1, para servirles. El androide se reclinó cortésmente. Helena y Kara sonrieron, casi a pesar de la sorpresa que aquello les había producido. -¿Qué dices, Hel? ¿Confiamos en él? -Bueno… se ve inofensivo y bastante educado – suspiró – ¿Por qué no? -Necesitamos comida, bebida y ropa… y medicamentos – enumeró Kara. El robot asintió, tomando nota en su cerebro computarizado. -Tenemos todo eso. Por favor, síganme y las acompañaré a recogerlo. -¿Quién lo hubiera dicho? – Helena y Kara siguieron al autómata – Servicio personalizado, cortesía del siglo XXXI. Me imagino que ese mundo sí debe ser interesante de visitar. Con varios carritos repletos de cosas, Kara y Helena siguieron a Alpha-1 de nuevo hacia la salida del supermercado. El robot se plantó al lado de lo que parecía ser la caja registradora y les habló: -Por favor, señoritas, tengan a bien depositar su compra en la maquina lectora a fin de que pueda calcular el importe de sus gastos. Gracias. -Uy – Kara miró a su compañera – Parece que la cosa no era gratuita, Hel. -Lo sabía – se quejó la otra – ¡Hasta en el futuro más distante de la Tierra, hay buitres capitalistas! ¡Demonios! -Curioso dicho, viniendo de la hija de uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo… Helena se encogió de hombros. -Mi madre es Catwoman. Cuando conoció a mi viejo, no tenía ni un centavo. -Peor: los robaba . -Ya, ya. -¿Qué hacemos? Digo, no traigo dinero encima… -Yo tampoco. Ambas miraron al autómata, quien seguía esperando. -No tenemos efectivo – le informaron. El robot se envaró. -En ese caso – les dijo, adoptando una postura más hostil y ya no tan cortés – le han hecho perder el valioso tiempo de utilidad a esta unidad. Devuelvan todo lo que han tomado y márchense. Gracias. -¡Pero mira nada más…! ¡Necesitamos todo esto! -Cumplo con el deber de informarles de que en caso de insistir y continuar con esa actitud belicosa, todo será tomado como una contravención a las leyes de robo y hurto del supermercado… y que se tomaran medidas drásticas al respecto. -¿Ah, sí, hojalata? – Helena arrastró su carrito por delante del robot hacia la salida, sin miedo – Vete al diablo. Vamos, Kara. Simplemente, ignora a este payaso mecánico. -¡ALERTA! ¡ALERTA! – gritó el androide – ¡Violación del protocolo! ¡Iniciar maniobras de defensa! Un ejército de autómatas apareció. Estos tenían el aspecto de guerreros y todos eran de color negro. -Magnifico. Una pelea – Kara resopló – Gracias, Hel. ¿Hacía falta armar todo este escándalo? -Bueno… Necesitamos de verdad todas estas cosas, así que… todo tuyo. Kara se trenzó en una encarnizada lucha a golpes de puño y patadas contra los robots. Mientras ella peleaba, Helena sacaba la mercadería del edificio y la cargaba en el Hummer… Un par de minutos después, en el lugar sólo quedaban montañas de chatarra de los robots destruidos. Kara terminó de hacer pedazos al último de ellos y se unió a su amiga en el vehículo. -¿Me parece a mí, o me usaste para hacer acopio de víveres mientras luchaba contra esos androides? – le dijo. -No puedes culparme por eso – se defendió Helena, con una media sonrisa en los labios – A veces, viene bien tener un kryptoniano en el equipo. No te enojes. -Vaya condenada amiga me he echado en esta ciudad de porquería – Kara resopló – Arranca el auto, antes de que me arrepienta y devuelva yo misma todo eso allá adentro. El enfado le duró poco. Al cabo de un momento, una sonrisa también asomó a sus labios. -¿Sabes? Hacemos un dúo fenomenal, tú y yo – comentó Helena – Deberían llamarnos \"Las Mejores del Mundo\" . ¿Qué te parece? -Como que alguien ha leído muchos comics de superhéroes – Kara rió – ¿Qué tal \"Thelma & Louise\" ? Ese sería mejor. -O \"El Gato y el Zorro\" … -Pero… ¿Quién sería el gato y quien la zorra? -Mi mamá era Catwoman – Helena puso en marcha el Hummer. Abandonaron el lugar – Saca tus propias conclusiones, querida amiga. Silencio. -Hel… -¿Sí? -Eres fatal, ¿lo sabes? -Eso me han dicho. FIN DE LA PRIMERA PARTE. CONTINUARA… 1 Helena hace referencia a la Crisis en las Tierras Infinitas. Esta Huntress es la misma –o una versión similar– a la que existió en la Edad de Plata en el mundo conocido como \"Tierra-2\" . 2 Quien no es otro que Superboy, el Chico de Acero, por supuesto.

Yep! Starting off strong with The Flash! Anyways I'm going with the flow so plz don't judge. Let's get the show on the road! Cisco Ramon x part bird!(like maleficent but you can control bird form)Reader: Cuddles in The Cortex It was very quiet in the Cortex as you and Cisco were quietly doing your work, trying not to look at each other because you had a crush on each other and neither of you new it. Caitlin was off somewhere unknown and so was Dr. Wells. Barry and Felicity were making goo-goo eyes at each other and that meant you and Cisco were alone. Being the goofy person you are, you decided to break the very awkward ice and sing a song perfect for the moment. \"Just the two of us.\" And in a quieter voice to mimic the song \"Just the two of us.\" And Cisco couldn't help but smirk. \"What?\" You asked innocently. \"Nothing…\" he said, still smirking. You went to open your laptop and it started playing \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne. \"Hey hey you you I don't like your girlfriend! Hey hey you you I think you need a new one. Hey hey you you I could be your girlfriend!\" Soon after Cisco started laughing so hard he was wheezing and crying while you were literally blushing as red as a tomato. You really were. You exed out of the tab and began your work while Cisco was still chuckling. \"Oh come on, (y/n)! Your so cute when you make a mistake and blu-\" he cut himself off and realized what he said. At that very moment Barry came in and a bunch of papers flew everywhere. \"Hey guys I was won- what's going on?\" You and Cisco were both blushing at this point. \"Oohhhh I see. Let me help. (Y/n) likes Cisco, Cisco likes (y/n).\" And with that he sped out. You both just sat there blushing and looking away. \"So, you like me (y/n)?\" He did his ever-so-famous eyebrow wiggling and you couldn't help but blush and hide your face. \"Come here. I know what you need.\" You walked over and squealed when he pulled you down into his lap. \"Better?\" You nodded your head and pleasantly sighed when he started kissing the back of your neck as you started to dose off. At that same moment Caitlin, Felicity, and Barry walked in silently and saw them cuddling. (Y/n) was apparently asleep with Cisco kissing her neck so only Cisco saw them. He made eyes that said 'for your own good I am telling you to leave before she kills you for witnessing a very vulnerable moment', so they just silently *awe* and Caitlin snaps a quick photo for Cisco and leaves. *time skip brought to you by pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows* You later awoke in your bed with Cisco with a tshirt and sweatpants and realized he must have drove you home somehow without waking you up. He wakes up and kisses your neck against hoping you'll fall back asleep but you don't. A moment passes and he remembers he got you something last night on the way home. He goes into the entry way and pulls a small(ish) box out. You were standing of the other side of the room when he opens the box and pulls out a very very very sparkly locket. Once you see it bird instincts kick in and you turn into a bird, fly over, snatch the necklace out of his hands, and turns back into a human, eyes fixed on the very shiny and sparkly locket all the while Cisco is chuckling at your behavior. You open the locket and see a picture of you on the left, and a picture of him on the right. Your favorite side. \"If you want to date me you can put the necklace on to show that. If not, you can keep the locket and do whatever with the pictures.\" You gave him a blank stare for about ten seconds before saying: \"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME OF COURSE IM GONNA DATE YOU YOU IDIOT!\" And he chuckled then kissed you. After that he had a rampage on you r neck with his mouth and remarked how sweet the skin on your neck was. The next day at work everyone noticed the hickeys because Cisco wouldn't let you wear anything that would cover them up. You were also wearing your know locket which distracted you so much to the point Cisco took it off you and hid it in his pocket.

From the moment he silenced the mob at the fire, from the moment his thunderous \"BE STILL!\" echoed over the crackle of flames and the swirl of voices and the sounds that could not be quieted of the forest that Max would be the best king, the only real king, the wild things had ever known. (Max, nia Savanto! Max, nia rêgo!) They stand in the ocean long after Max's ship is a spot on the horizon, and Carol waits, his fur matted and salty, long after the others have retreated to shore. Douglas, ever the defender, ever the protector, finds him when he doesn't come back. \"Carol?\" he asks, his voice quiet and hesitant, scared that he'll get himself into a frenzy again. He always does when someone he loves leaves. \"He was supposed to be our savior,\" Carol whispers, and Douglas' heart breaks for his childlike mind. \"I told you. He was just a boy, Carol. He did what he could and it wasn't enough-\" \"But it was! It was enough for a while! We were happy! K.W. was here, Judith was kinder, everything was fine! Why couldn't it have stayed that way?\" Carol's voice thunders through the island, birds in the forefront of the forest taking flight by the hundreds. \"Carol,\" Douglas sighs, \"Let it be. We let ourselves have fun and it's time to stop.\" \"I don't see why we have to stop.\" (Kie vi iri? Kial vi forlasas nin?) \"You have to grow up, Carol. Please, just, come join us by the fire. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. Okay?\" (Kial vi mensogas al ni, reĝo?) \"Come back to the fire, Carol.\" Douglas prods. \"You'll get sick or something out here.\" It is judith's forced howled laughter that tears Carol's eyes away from the horizon that has since darkened and bled into the ocean, the black of the sky and the black of the waves meshing into nothing, the stars in the sea reflected back into the sky so that Carol can't tell if he's even right side up. He turns to Douglas. \"Okay. Okay. Let's go home.\" Douglas smiles and touches the feathers of his remaining arm to Carols hulking stripes ones guiding the dazed wild thing to the fire. The others sit around it and speak in hushed tones. It is Alexander who first notices their return. \"Welcome back, uh, Carol.\" he offers, timidly, and Carol has a hard time blaming him for being so uneasy. (Max, nia tirano. Max, nia ekstermanto.) Bernard sets a heavy black hoof on Carol's shoulder, and Ira nods to him. \"You're going to have to do something with the ruins.\" Judith says, without looking at him. \"I know.\" Carol says, because he really does know. He knows he has to grow up. \"We can help.\" Ira offers. \"If you really need it.\" \"No.\" Carol says, his voice a rumble just fierce enough to vibrate in the ground beneath their large feet. \"I have to. I gotta. You know. Fix what I broke. I gotta take responsibility for my own stuff.\" God knows nobody else will be responsible for you. \"That's very responsible of you, Carol.\" Douglas chimes patiently. Carol nods and collapses in the grass beside Alexander. He tosses a stick into the fire and it crackles. Ira and Judith turn into themselves again. There will be no king to save you, Carol thinks. You have to fix what you've broken on your own. Maybe he did something good after all. (Max, nia instruisto. Max, nia salvio.) A/n Translations! From Esperanto! Max, our saviour, max, our king!

Now he was married with a nine-year-old daughter and taught at the local public high school. His daughter, Rina, reminded Max very much of himself when he was her age, only she was quieter and more introspective. Mostly she kept to herself and drew pictures of fantasy creatures. Max's wife, Caroline, had unfortunately been diagnosed with bipolar disorder about a year ago. When she took her medicine, she was the sweet, warm, friendly mother that Rina was accustomed to. But when her mother began to stabilize, she would slack off on her medication, and scenes like this would unfold… Rina sat at the kitchen table, rubbing the spot on her cheek where her raging mother had struck her. All she could do was stare up at her mother with tears streaming down her face. Rina was so stricken with fear and crushing sadness that she could not even move. \"You eat that grilled cheese or you're not going to Heaven!\" Caroline shrieked at her daughter as she whirled around the kitchen, purposelessly banging pots and pans. Rina didn't even like grilled cheese. Her daddy didn't like frozen corn, and she didn't like grilled cheese. Had mommy forgotten? \"That food is a gift from God!\" Caroline bellowed. \"God has no love in his heart for little girls who refuse his gifts! THERE'S NO ROOM IN HEAVEN FOR UNGRATEFUL BRATS!!!\" Every time her mother raged, Rina tried hard to glimpse a love light in her mother's eyes. She tried this now, and when she could find none, she burst into tears afresh. Her upper set of teeth lost their hold on her bottom lip and she gave a sobbing, \"Uuuh-hhhuuuuuhhhh\" sound. Caroline stopped in her crazed dance around the kitchen to come face to face with Rina. The look on her mother's face was enough to make the little girl wet herself out of sheer fright. Issuing sad moans and reaching out for a mother's care was not allowed right now. \"ENOUGH! You're getting exactly what you deserve!\" Caroline roared savagely, and slapped Rina across her already sore cheek. \"CAROLINE!\" Her father was home! Oh, thank you, God! Rina's father would fix things! He was always able to stop her mother from raging, talking to angels who weren't there, or writing meaningless words on the walls of her bedroom. Horrorstruck, Max threw down his teaching materials and dashed across the kitchen to restrain his wife. Rina wanted desperately to move from her chair to seek comfort from her father, but she still felt too numb to move. \"Rina, go to your room and stay up there until I come to get you!\" Max cried as he secured his wife's fists and fumbled with his cell phone. Rina didn't need telling twice; she leaped off her chair and ran upstairs as fast as her legs could carry her. Max speed-dialed the Our Lady of Peace Crisis Center and frantically yelled into the mouthpiece, \"Hello, this is Max Raymonds, and my wife, Caroline, is having a bipolar rage….\" Rina drew her legs into her stomach and rocked back and forth on her bed. She looked around the room at all of the Wild Thing pictures that her father had drawn for her. When Max had returned from his journey, he had told his mother and sister all sorts of stories about where he had gone. After all, he had made a promise to Daniel the bull that he would say good things about them when he went back, and he made sure he honored that promise. As it turned out, however, Max's loyalty to his furry friends earned him a trial period on Ritalin, at the suggestion of his mother's new husband. Rina stopped rocking and began to think very hard. The home situation hadn't improved since her mother was diagnosed. She didn't smile or sing to Rina as much as she used to, and she just didn't have as much warmth to her anymore. Rina looked over at a picture that her father had drawn of a fuzzy, striped Wild Thing with a pink button nose, feathery legs, and sad, knowing eyes. Max had told her that the creature's name was Carol, and in the picture, Carol was smiling and cradling a likeness of Rina in his warm, comforting arms. Rina clutched at the drawing and wept brokenheartedly for the warmth and tenderness that she would never know. Just then, the door opened, and Max cautiously walked in. He sat down on Rina's bed and pushed the wild, black hair away from her slapped cheek to examine it. \"Did she do that to you?\" he asked her gently. Rina nodded calmly. Max sighed. \"I'm so sorry. I should have been home earlier.\" Rina shrugged and pulled out the drawing again; trying not to look at her father. \"Not your fault,\" she muttered. \"You know, don't you, that I'll never hurt you, Rina,\" Max reassured his daughter. He then scooped her up in his arms and rocked her gently from side to side. \"I'll eat you up, I love you so,\" he whispered to her; echoing the words spoken lovingly to him by KW almost twenty-one years ago. He still had not forgotten her soothing touch, or how she'd saved him from becoming a victim of Carol's violent panic. After a while, he sat Rina down. He looked her in the eyes solemnly. \"Rina, there is something I have to tell you,\" he began. \"Your mother is very sick, and Daddy called some doctors to come get her and keep her in the hospital for a while, until she feels better. She may not be back for a long time; no one knows when she will be back, but…\" Rina was stunned. Her mother had been taken away from her and no one knew when she would return? \"NO!!!!\" Rina cried, wrenching herself out of her father's arms and out of her room, down the stairs, and out the front door. \"Rina, come back! Where are you going??\" Max cried out in panic as he barreled towards the front door to try and catch his daughter. But then he noticed the direction she was running in. She seemed to be running towards the same forest he had run towards when he was just her age. When he realized that, he knew for certain that she would be all right. She would be safe where she was going. \"Oh, thank, you, Jesus,\" he prayed as he knelt and began to sob convulsively. \"Thank you so much…I know she'll be all right now.\" Rina ran further and further into the forest until she came to a clearing with a mass of thin, broken branches near a shoreline. Exhausted from fear and from running, she fell forward and just lay on her stomach for a moment or two, sobbing. Suddenly, she noticed a boat at the water's edge. She looked at it in wonder. Would it take her far away from all the bad things in her life? Should she get into it and go where it took her? Would she find some friends? She then decided that anything was better than staying where she was. So, she stepped into the small boat, hoisted the sail, and drifted away from the shore. She never did notice the name \"Max\" carved into a section of the hull. All she wanted to do was get away. Her voyage seemed to take the longest time. Maybe it was because Rina was at the age when ten minutes seemed more like an hour, but at this point, it felt as though she had been on the boat for a day, a span of weeks; practically a year! Just the same, she waited patiently to see where the boat would take her. As she spotted a mountainous island in the distance, the sky darkened and a thunderstorm began. Waves crashed around Rina and drenched her with freezing cold water. At last, she found an outcropping of rocks; the perfect place to moor her boat while she explored the island! She ducked under the water and pushed the boat up onto the rocks to steady it, and then walked towards the island, panting and shivering. She realized that the only way to get up onto the island's surface was to scale the mountain peaks that bordered it. Rina was nervous about climbing the mountain, but she wanted to explore after having been confined to a boat all this time. Besides, she could hear voices coming from the surface, and she curious to see who lived there. When she finally made it up the mountainside, she was trembling from the cold and her teeth were chattering. She staggered through some brush and brambles until she saw an encampment with several perfectly circular little houses with controlled fires burning around them. Rina walked over to investigate. She didn't notice a thick tree root snaking its way out of the ground, and she tripped and fell forward. She hoisted herself up again, spitting out wood chips and dirt. Then she heard a staccato, gentlemanly voice ask, \"Hey, are you all right?\" Rina looked up, and to her amazement, saw that there was a huge, upright-walking chicken looking down at her with concern. A chicken who was missing an arm that had been haphazardly replaced by a stick. \"Oh, dear, you're absolutely filthy!\" the chicken exclaimed fussily, lifting her off her feet with his one available arm and brushing the grime and dirt away with his feathers. Rina stared at the chicken. He looked familiar…had she seen him in one of her father's drawings once? \"And you're soaking wet, too! It's a good thing I found you!\" the chicken went on. Then he called over his shoulder, \"Judith! Ira! Alex! Come over here; I've found something!\" Then he turned his attention back to Rina. \"Oh, I'm sorry! I should introduce myself! My name is Douglas, and this…\" he went on, gesturing towards the other creatures who were hurrying over, \"… is Judith, Ira, and Alex.\" \"Well, well; look what the huge chicken dragged in,\" cracked Judith, the beast with a lion's mane and a rhino horn. \"Aaaawww, she's shivering,\" murmured Ira, a melancholy fellow with horns and a big nose. \"It won't bite us, will it?\" asked Alexander, a small, white goat creature who cowered behind Judith. Douglas set Rina down. \"Well, what do you think? We LOVE having visitors!\" he beamed at her. It took Rina a while to find her voice. Finally she said, \"M..my name's Rina. It's very nice to meet you all,\" before she shivered convulsively and let out a big sneeze. Judith yelped and jumped out of the way of the snot shower. \"Say it, don't spray it!\" she exclaimed, laughing. \"Oh, dear, you mustn't catch cold! We need to get you warm!\" Douglas fretted. Judith tsk'ed, shook her head, and walked over to Rina. She scooped the little girl up and enveloped her in her warm, fuzzy arms. \"There, this should keep you warm, hun!\" she said soothingly, as she rocked the little girl gently back and forth. She smiled down at Rina. She was starting to feel rather fond of her. A lot of the child's traits reminded Judith of the little cub she always wanted. Those who knew Judith would never guess that she wanted cubs of her own, which was why she kept this longing a secret. Rina eyed Judith's horn and reached up to touch it. Judith frowned and and gently pushed Rina's hand away. \"Ah-ah-ah, don't go touching my horn; it's really sharp,\" she warned the girl. \"Yeah, but it's cool,\" Rina replied, stroking the horn gently. \"You're tickling me,\" Judith giggled, rubbing her horn where Rina had stroked it. \"But it feels good.\" Ira, Alexander, and a huge bull named Daniel who had just now joined the group, were now completely dumbfounded as they watched Judith and Rina interact. They couldn't remember the last time Judith had taken anyone in her arms, warned someone away from danger, or giggled. Usually Judith was turned completely inward, was sassy and pessimistic, and her cure-all solution for any kind of problem was to \"eat it!\" Douglas broke into everyone's bewilderment with his fussing. \"Where's KW? We need a motherly touch over here, and fast!\" he dithered, apparently not realizing that Judith had the situation well under control. \"She's off somewhere…AGAIN,\" came a tough-sounding, yet sniffly and choked-up voice from behind a tree. Douglas sighed exasperatedly and shook his head. \"KW can't just keep wandering off all the time! We need her now!\" Rina looked over at the beast emerging and realized that it resembled Carol from her father's drawing! She fished the drawing out of her pocket and looked at it, then back at the creature. It WAS Carol! \"Hey, Carol! Is that YOU?\" she called over to the fuzzy, striped Wild Thing with the pink button nose, feathery legs, and the sad, knowing eyes. Carol stopped in his tracks and noticed Rina for the first time. \"Yes….it's me,\" he replied, his eyes wide. \"How do you know my name? And where did you come from all of a sudden?\" Rina smiled and handed her drawing to him. Carol took it from her and read what was written at the bottom of the page: \"Carol with Rina- by Rina's father, Max.\" Carol looked up and stared at Rina. \"You're…you're Max's….you're Max's little cub,\" he said weakly. \"Uh, huh,\" Rina replied, taking hold of Carol's paw. All of the Wild Things gaped at the little girl in Judith's arms for a moment. Then they all graced her with soft, sad, wistful smiles. Carol shuffled closer to Rina with a grateful smile, and pressed his face into her stomach and cried happy tears. …………… In all of the rigmarole, Rina's cold had become worse, and Carol had sent Douglas to find KW (wherever she was) and put together some medicine for the sick little girl. Carol crawled into his little circular house with Rina snug in his arms. \"Well, this is my little house,\" he told her, trying to sound cheerful about it. In truth, he'd never cared for the tiny little houses because they kept all the Wild Things apart from one another. Very soon, Douglas showed up. He crawled into the house, breathless. \"I managed to find KW, and she's coming right away!\" he assured Carol. He looked over at Rina and grinned. \"She's so excited to be meeting the daughter of our previous king!\" Rina smiled back, and then sneezed. \"Oh my, not another one!\" Douglas cried, scooping Rina into his one arm. \"That makes your fifth sneeze since you arrived! I've been keeping track!\" Rina looked amused. The Wild Things could be really funny. \"You have?\" \"Certainly I have! You sound just like me when the spring flowers are pollinating! I have this thing where I get hay fever every summer and fall! Do you know what folks do when they get hay fever?\" Douglas asked as a means of engaging the girl. \"Uuuummmm…..they sneeze a lot?\" Rina volunteered. \"Very good! They sneeze a lot!\" Douglas replied. \"And it so happens that when I sneeze, I lose some feathers, and they go all over the place! So, anyone who happens to be near me at the time starts sneezing, too!\" Rina had to laugh at this. \"It's true,\" Carol affirmed with a grin. He rubbed his finger under his nose as if all of this talk about feathers and sneezes made his nose tickle. Just then, KW, a pretty female Wild Thing, arrived at the front of the hut carrying a bowl. Rina looked over at her and smiled. She looks just like she does in Dad's drawings, Rina thought. KW returned her smile. \"All right, you guys; comin' through with medicine!\" she announced. Rina looked at Douglas, puzzled. \"Are you gonna take medicine, Douglas? For your hay fever?\" Carol looked at Rina and laughed. \"No, YOU are!\" he replied, poking her in the chest. \"Me??\" Rina asked. She didn't really care for medicine. \"Yes, you!\" KW answered teasingly as she squeezed inside the house. Douglas realized it was getting crowded and beat a hasty retreat out the door. \"I better go, fellows; it's getting kinda tight in here,\" he said, waving goodbye. \"Yeah,\" Carol replied, more to himself than to Douglas. \"That's one of the issues we have with these small houses…not enough room for everybody.\" KW looked up at Carol when he said that, but quickly looked away as she mixed up the medicine with a pestle. \"Glad you came back,\" Carol ventured, trying to catch her eye. He didn't succeed. Instead, KW turned her attention to Rina. \"So, you're Max's daughter, huh? Welcome to Where the Wild Things Are,\" she said warmly. Rina sneezed. KW gave her a sympathetic look. \"Poor little cub. Not feeling too well, huh? Well, don't worry; this medicine will make you feel better,\" KW assured her. She gently pushed the bowl towards Rina. Rina shied away. \"I-I don't know…\" KW leaned forward and looked into Rina's eyes. \"You know, Rina, this medicine was made from the same recipe my mother used when I was a cub. All those nights when I was sick, and I threatened to wake the herd with sniffles, coughs, and sneezes that seemed to rock the trees, she would get up, no matter what time it was, and find some medicine for me to take.\" Then she smiled and leaned closer. \"And after I had the medicine, I felt much better, and we both fell back asleep, all snuggled up! You and I can do the same thing afterwards, if you want.\" Rina lit up. Her own mother had never said that to her. \"Okay, I'll take it!\" she said, seizing the bowl from KW. \"That-a-girl, Rina!\" Carol cheered. ………………. Later on that night, Rina was just about to drift off asleep next to Carol and KW in the cozy, circular little hut. KW had been right; her cold was much better. How wonderful it was to have friends who really cared for you as a person. She'd return home soon to tell her father, and maybe her mother, about all the adventures she'd had. But not yet. Not yet.

It's for you!\" Her father, Max, called. \"For me? Wow, no one ever calls me on the phone!\" Rina said to herself. Who could be calling her? She didn't have that many friends at school – her only friends to speak of were the Wild Things. She rushed downstairs and took the cordless phone from Max. \"Hello,\" she answered politely. \"Oh, hi, Rina!\" she heard Douglas say. \"Douglas?\" Rina asked perplexedly. \"I didn't know you guys had a phone!\" \"Well, we do!\" Douglas replied. And before Rina could ask any more questions pertaining to where on Earth the phone came from, he went on. \"Rina, we've got an emergency of sorts on our hands,\" he declared. \"Carol's dust allergy is really bad, and he asked me – between sneezes – to ask you to come over, and just… you know…\" \"Sure, Douglas!! I'll be over in the boat as soon as I can!\" Rina said, hanging up the phone. She had an idea as to how she could make Carol feel better, but she was not sure it would work or not. Rina stuck her head into the hall closet and pulled out a small, battery - operated Hoover that her father used to clean out the hard - to - reach crevices in the furniture and walls. \"If Carol did some vacuuming, then maybe he'd feel better!\" Rina said to herself. She rushed out the door, calling, \"Bye, Dad!! I'm going to Where the Wild Things Are!\" Once Rina made it to the spot where the shoreline met the forest clearing, she hopped into the small boat that was moored there and started the journey that semed to go on for a 24 - hour day, then weeks, then practically a year. It was always worth it, though; since she knew she would see her warm, cuddly Wild Thing friends once the trip ended. Once she made it to the shore of the Wild Things' island, she saw Douglas standing there, waiting for her. \"Hi, Douglas!\" Rina called, running over to hug him. \"Thank you for coming, Rina!\" Douglas replied. \"Carol's not been feeling well at all! I'm afraid his allergies are even worse than mine!\" \"Well, don't worry, Douglas!\" Rina answered, holding up the vacuum. \"I think I have an idea.\" Rina crept quietly over to Carol's circular hut and knocked on the outside wall. \"Carol?\" she asked tentatively. No telling what sort of mood he was in. She heard a few moist sniffles and snuffles, and a cough or two. \"Rina? Is that you?\" she heard Carol wheeze. \"Please come in.\" Rina was relieved. It sounded as though with Carol feeling as bad as he did, he just wanted to regress to being a snuggly little cub and be engulfed in sympathy. Rina peered into the hut to see Carol leaning against the wall sadly dabbing at his button nose with a tissue. His nose was typically a healthy, rosy sort of color, but due to Carol's allergy, it had turned an angry, tomato - reddish tinge. His eyes were streaming with itchy tears. Rina became alarmed and flooded with feelings of empathy. \"Awww, Carol, don't cry,\" she said sympathetically as she gently wiped his eyes with a hankie that Douglas had given her. \"I'm here, now, to help you feel better.\" \"Oh, Little Cub, I'm not really crying,\" Carol hastily reassured her. \"My allergies make my eyes all weepy, that's all.\" He sniffled and wiggled his nose. His eyelids fluttered and he began to take gasping little breaths as if he were about to sneeze. His nostrils began to flare and tremor, and a little pearly teardrop squeezed out of each tear duct in his eyes. After this buildup had gone on for about 30 seconds, he waved his paw under his nostrils to somehow help the sneeze along. Five seconds later, he gave up and let out a big breath of air. \"Sorry, false alarm,\" he told Rina, who had her arms up, shielding her head. He tapped her arms. \"You can relax,\" he said with a chuckle. Rina dropped her arms and looked at him. \"For a minute there, I thought you were going to sneeze,\" she confided. \"I thought so, too,\" Carol replied, rubbing at his nostrils with the hanky in order to make the tickly sensations subside. \"I hate when that happens. My nose will start to itch and I'll get all ready to sneeze, and then - \" - he sighed in a whimpering sort of way - \"the urge just goes away.\" Rina looked thoughtful. \"If we had one of Douglas' feathers, we could tickle your nose a little bit, and then you'd sneeze for sure!\" Carol frowned and shifted his body to stare into the distance. \"My nose tickles plenty. Feels like dozens of feathers tickling me,\" he grumbled, rubbing a fuzzy finger under his nostrils. \"That's not the problem.\" Rina began to worry that she'd accidentally made Carol cranky. Carol was one of the best friends anyone could have, and he was huggable and mischievous and very protective and loyal, but it was incredibly easy to put him in a petulant mood, or in some cases, provoke a tantrum. She'd had the idea of vacuuming his hut for him so it wouldn't be so dusty, but now she realized that what Carol really needed at the moment was to be cheered up a little bit. \"You know what I do to make myself feel better when I feel sick, Carol?\" Rina asked, peering at him to catch his attention. \"Oh yeah? What's that?\" Carol asked her. Rina shrank back. \"You might think it's kind of baby,\" she replied. Carol smiled indulgently at her. \"Aaaaww, c'mon. You know you can tell ol' Carol anything,\" he cajoled. Rina smiled. \"Sometimes I sing to myself,\" she replied. \"Aaaww, really?\" Carol asked sweetly. \"Uh, huh. My mom used to sing to me sometimes, but since she went away, I just sing to myself,\" Rina replied, shrugging. \"Gosh, I'm sorry, Little Cub,\" Carol said with a wet sniffle. \"I'm so sorry you're all alone like that. You want me to sing to you? I can if you'd like. I'm not too good at it, but it would take my mind off of how terrible I feel.\" \"Well, actually, Carol,\" Rina began, \"I thought maybe we could sing together.\" \"Really? Um, okay,\" Carol replied. \"What would you like to sing? I don't have a particle... partic - ler...uh, specific preference.\" Rina smiled adoringly at her fuzzy friend. He always got sort of tongue - tied when he tried to pronounce the word \"particular,\" the right way. \"Well, Carol, I know a song that's a great song to sing when you have the sneezes,\" Rina answered. No sooner had Rina said this did Carol start to feel his allergies coming on again. \"AHH - CHOO!\" he sneezed. \"Like right now?\" \" Especially right now!\" Rina exclaimed. \"Well, how does it go?\" Carol wanted to know. Rina hesitated for a moment, then began to sing, \"Down by the meadow in an itty - bitty pool swam three little fishies and a mama fishy, too! Swim, said the mama fishy, swim - \" Carol interrupted. \"I know that song!\" he said eagerly. \"When all seven of us Wild Things were little cubs, we'd sing that song over and over again while the Wilder Things were migrating to a village where the Black Gunkies wouldn't find us! It nearly drove them crazy, but us cubs had a great time!\" \"Really? Great!\" Rina said. She was happy that she'd chosen something carol remembered from his childhood. So the two of them sang together for a while (with Carol providing the sneezing parts due to his allergy), until Carol said, \"Say, Rina, I'm starting to feel somewhat better!\" \"Oh, I'm so happy, Carol!!\" Rina replied, snuggling into his tummy and tickling it. Carol laughed and laughed.

This isn't, strictly speaking, a fic based on WTWTA, but it is a dialogue that takes place between me and WTWTA plushies in a Border's store. It also tells the story of how I made the Judith plushie I talked about in my profile! I don't own any characters or Wild Things in this!! There, now I don't have to worry about lawsuits, LOL! Enjoy! Once, I was in a Borders bookstore while my father was getting a haircut in the nearby salon. I was browsing around in the Children's Section (as it is the least crowded area of the store on a Saturday), and I eventually sat down on a stool next to a display of stuffed Wild Things. I took notice of the stuffed Wild Things and smiled at them. The way they were depicted in the original storybook used to frighten me as a young child, but now that I was much older, I found them quite charming. I walked over to the display and picked up a Wild Thing with a black, shaggy mane and tail, and a broad, mischievous smile. I playfully brought the fluffy tail under its nose and waved it around, tickling the handsome fellow. \"Aaaah! That tickles! Stop it!\" cried the Wild Thing, who had started to giggle and squirm in my hands. I stopped tickling the Wild Thing and gaped at him. \"You're talking to me!\" I cried. \"Stuffed animals can't talk!\" I looked around to see if anyone noticed that I was now deep in conversation with a stuffed toy. Luckily, no one seemed to take any notice. \" We can talk,\" said a female Wild Thing plush with long, red hair and a nervous expression. \"My name is Sipi, but everyone calls me KW. And that fellow you have in your hands is Carol.\" \"Yeah, Carol. Like a girl,\" Carol told me, crossing his eyes. I laughed. Then, a little doll of a boy in a wolf suit approached me, as he rode on the shoulders of a scowling, shaggy Bull – thing. \"I'm King Max!\" the boy doll announced boldly. \"I look after these guys!\" He then snatched a pen out of my jeans pocket and pointed it at me like a scepter. \"Who are you?\" \"Uuumm… I just wanted to check you guys out,\" I replied uneasily. \"I'm sorry if I disturbed you at all. I can go look somewhere else…\" \"No, no!\" cried Carol, sounding as though he might cry. \"Please stay! Please keep holding me!\" \"You mustn't mind Max, friend,\" Daniel, the bull, told me. \"His status of royalty has gone to his head.\" He frowned at the stuffed boy – king who kept fidgeting on his shoulders. \"You may stop bouncing your tiny, firmly – stuffed rear end on my aching shoulders anytime now, your Majesty.\" I had to laugh at the antics of the Wild Things. I was having a wonderful time! Except for just then, I heard the sound of piteous crying. I gently set Carol down and turned my attentions to a shelf populated by other stuffed animals. There, on the far corner of the shelf, sat the most cuddly – looking little stuffed lion I had ever seen. A little pool had gathered under her, and she just cried and sniffled and wiped her eyes with her paws and tail. \"Aaaawww, hey there, sweetheart,\" I said, hurrying over. \"What can the matter be?\" The lion noticed me, and started to say something, but instead gave a violent hiccough from having cried so hard. She began taking deep breaths to calm herself to the point where she could speak clearly, and in order to help, I started patting her silky mane and singing a song that my kindergarten teacher used to sing to me when I needed consolation: Oh, dear, what can the matter be, Oh, dear, what can the matter be, Oh, dear, what can the matter be – \"Judith is feeling so sad!\" the cute little lion finished for me, her voice wavering on the last note. Our poignant little duet had not gone unnoticed. Behind me, I could hear Carol swallowing a lump in his throat, and KW murmured to herself, \"Poor thing.\" Max appeared bored by all the sentiment. I smiled at Judith and cupped my hand under her chin so she could look at me properly. \"Is that your name; Judith?\" I asked her. She smiled faintly and nodded. \"That's a lovely name,\" I said. \"I bet your friends call you \"Judy.\" \"I don't have any friends,\" Judith wailed. \"All the other lions besides me were all bought up.\" Her eyes began to fill with tears again. \"Oh, you must have felt terrible!\" I said empathetically, as I gave her some tissues. \"What I really want,\" Judith continued; her voice sounding congested as she wiped her nose, \"is to be a Wild Thing, like them.\" She pointed to Carol, Bernard, KW, and Max. \"A fine aspiration!\" I commended her, patting her gently on the back. \"The world certainly needs more Wild Things!\" \"But I can't be one,\" Judith cried. \"I'm not allowed.\" \"Not allowed?\" I asked. \"Why ever not?\" \"Well, look at me,\" Judith replied, with a hint of exasperation in her voice. \"I haven't got any horns or claws.\" I thought for a moment, and then I came up with a great idea. \"I think I can solve your problem, Judith,\" I told her. \"You can? But how?\" Judith asked as she stared up at me with soft puppy dog eyes. \"If you come home with me, I can easily set you up with some horns and claws!\" I said. \"How about it?\" \"Oh, yes!!\" Judith cried, vaulting off the shelf and into my arms. \"Thank you so much!\" \"You're welcome so much!\" I replied as she began licking my face. \"So no more crying, okay? Your paws might get wet, and you'd catch a cold!\" \"Hey, can we come, too?\" Carol asked. \"Sure!\" I replied. \"You can all come!\" \"You heard her, Daniel!\" Max squawked at the bull – thing. \"Get moving!\" He thwacked the poor creature on the nose with my pen. Daniel looked at me with a supplicating expression. \"Does he have to come?\" he whispered to me, jerking his head towards the tyrant on his shoulders. \"I heard that!\" Max shrieked, biffing Daniel once more with the pen. \"I will not stand for treason! No supper for you tonight!\" I knelt down so that I was eye – to – eye with Max, and I held out my open hand. \"Your Majesty, if you would do me the honor of returning my pen,\" I said in a very firm voice. Max pouted and handed it over. So, we all proceeded to the checkout counter, where I purchased them, and then I took them all home. While Max and Carol, KW, and Daniel got settled in on a comfortable shelf (Carol finally decided on my bed, which was fine with me), I cut scraps from an old, tattered pair of khaki Capri pants that I had, and sewed a pair of horns and some claws for Judith. I wanted to document the whole meticulous process, so I found a disposable camera and snapped away at regular intervals, while Judith posed. I told her to relax and fall deeply asleep, and then I attached these to her head and paws. When Judith awoke, she was thrilled beyond words. I was quite satisfied with the end results, as well, and showed her to my father, stepmother, and older stepbrother; who all thought that she had turned out very well indeed. How pleased I was to have made someone's day a little happier – even if that someone happened to be nothing but a little stuffed lion! ","Summary":" Where MY Wild Things Are Hello, peoples.

Sheesh, it's not like there's any other goat looking horned creatures in this airport!\" He shook his head and snorted a half laugh at the idea of talking to himself then continued walking along the wide passageway, gingerly weaving around scores of other travelers and their rolling luggage, grateful to have fur and freedom from baggage. He rounded a corner and found what he'd been looking for; a small sign that read \"To Gate 77\". Surprisingly, it pointed down a smaller, narrower hallway that seemed to have fewer people using it. \"Good thing the travel guide told me how to find that hallway\" he said softly. \"I could easily have missed it.\" He started toward the narrow passageway then suddenly froze, causing the man walking behind him to run into his back. \"Sorry about that\" said the man, unable to take his eyes of Alexander's large horns. \"It's OK\" shrugged Alexander, \"Sorry, I shouldn't have stopped so suddenly, but I just saw someone I know.\" Alexander hurried across the wide passageway toward a small café while dodging other travelers, frogger-style. \"KW! KW!\" he shouted, a huge grin spreading across his face. KW, surprised to hear someone calling her name, put down her book and looked up. \"Hey Alexander, where'd you come from!\" she said, standing. They embraced and stood smiling at one another, amazed by the fortuitous meeting but pleasantly surprised their paths had crossed against all odds. \"How's your trip going?\" asked KW as they sat down at the table. \"Oh it's been one heck of an adventure.\" he replied. \"The world is sure a strange and interesting place, and a little frightening. But I am so looking forward to going home!\" \"No doubt\" said KW. \"But what are you doing here, KW? You're also traveling now?\" \"Yeah I decided it was time to get out and see the world, so I took off not long after you left. You were just a few days ahead of me. You know, at the time I didn't think about how to get home and it looks like there aren't many options for us Wild Things. Somehow I found my way to this airport, so I guess the answer is here someplace.\" \"Ha, of all the airports in all the towns in all the world, you walked into mine!\" said Alexander, a crooked grin spreading across his face. \"You're sure right about the getting back part. I wandered for quite a while before I found this place, and I'm glad you found it too. Are you ready to go home now?\" KW cocked her head to one side while absentmindedly twirling a few strands of her long auburn hair. \"Yeah I think so. You know, the more I see of the world the more I realize what a wonderful place our island really is. I think it's like a little slice of heaven or something.\" Alexander nodded his agreement. \"Well, we must be on the same flight\" he said, barely able to contain his joy at the prospect of travelling with KW. \"WTL Airlines, flight J-316. But you know that of course, since it's the only airline that goes anywhere near the island, and there's only the one flight. It takes a special plane that has those floating thingys down by the wheels, so it can land in the water. You must have found out what I did, I mean about the ticket and all. When I read the travel guide and realized what a ticket cost I felt like I'd been hit with a hundred dirt clods! Isn't it amazing the CEO of the airline will give a free ticket to any Wild Thing that knows how to ask him the right way? But we'd better hurry because the ticket agent said that flight can leave at any time, and we don't really know how long we have. Are you ready?\" KW frowned. \"Alexander, I don't know what you're talking about. Why does it matter which flight we take, or even which airline? What is WTL Airlines, Wild Things Limited or something? And what's this nonsense about a ticket? You don't need any ticket.\" Alexander's brow furrowed as he looked at her with a puzzled expression, then snorted a short laugh. \"Oh, you got me! Very funny joke KW, but now we've got to get going. Time to pick up those webbed feet. We need to move it, move it!\" He started to rise. \"Oh, I asked the agent what WTL means and it has something to do with the CEO's son.\" KW remained seated. \"I'm not joking. Why would you think that?\" \"Well…um…I thought you must have been joking because like I said, there's just the one way home. I mean it, I've really searched. You have to be careful because there are misguided people out there that try to tell you about other airlines and flights, but I found the true travel guide that explains everything. The agent also showed me on the electronic sign thingy, and believe me, there is only one flight you and I can take.\" He paused, a look of concern spreading across his face. \"KW, don't you know all this? Have you asked for your free ticket?\" \"Come on, Alexander, you don't really believe everything in that travel guide, do you? Sorry, but you're wrong. You can't know all that, and I think it makes more sense to be able to just randomly board any plane from any airline to get home. Why should we be limited to just one flight or even one airline? Why do we need a ticket? No, you've got it all wrong. There's no need to go to gate 77. We can just pick any plane and I know it'll somehow take us to the island. It makes perfect sense to me.\" \"KW, you're scaring me. If we were trying to get to just any city in the world you'd be right about other flights, but we're talking about our island. It's not like any other place.\" \"Alexander, what you believe isn't fair. What about all the Wild Things that never find the travel guide you told me about, or the ones that read it but don't understand or believe it?\" \"But KW, I found it, and really there are copies of it everywhere. But I don't know, there may be other arrangements for those few that don't have any way to find the info, for whatever reason, but that doesn't apply to us because we do know about it. We have to act on the info we have. What may or may not apply to others doesn't apply to us, once we know about the travel guide. Leave that to the CEO, that's all up to him. Now please, there may not be much time. You need a ticket for flight J-316. I'm telling you the truth KW, there is no other way home.\" She leaned back in the chair and folded her hands on the table. \"Sorry Alexander, I don't agree with that, and I don't think you can change my mind.\" A pained expression spread across his pale face and his shoulders visibly slumped. He lowered his eyes for a moment and picked up a wooden coffee stirrer from the table. \"You're right about that KW\" he said very softly. He raised his eyes and looked at her. \"All I can do is share what I've found, and ask you to take a hard look at all the facts. But I can't get a ticket for you, and I can't make you ask the CEO for one. He won't force you to board the right plane, and I can't drag you to it. You have free will and all.\" As he spoke he turned the small wooden stick over and over in his hands, as if it were a wishing stone. \"I'm glad you understand\" KW said with a hint of a smile. \"And I appreciate you sharing your views with me. I really do.\" \"KW, I care about you and want to make sure you get home safely. When I first saw you here I thought maybe I found you for a reason, but now it seems as if I've made things worse. Please don't be angry with me.\" A few small tears formed at the corners of his pale blue eyes. \"I should have known that you'll have to discover the truth on your own.\" She put her hand on his. \"Alexander, don't be silly! I'll be fine. I think some of the stuff in the travel guide is wrong, or maybe just misunderstood. Everyone will get home, no matter what flight we take. Don't pay any attention to that business about having to find the right flight. You know, I'm not sure the CEO even has the authority to decide what flights go where. I think we should help him by telling others that he doesn't really have any rules or anything, and that we can do as we please and still get home just fine. Otherwise everyone will think he's harsh.\" Alexander looked into KW's intelligent yellow eyes and winced at the realization that she had made assumptions about how the CEO intended to run his airline, despite all the detailed information in the travel guide. He had always admired her sharp mind but now it seemed her sweet nature and optimism had clouded her judgment, and she didn't fully comprehend what he had come to accept; that the CEO had a right to operate his airline the way he thought best. Alexander had always known that KW's intellect was superior to his, yet in his own childlike way he somehow understood the truth. He had studied the travel guide and found compelling evidence that it contained trustworthy information. More than anything, he knew there was no way he or KW could ever hope to pay the price of the ticket needed for the one flight home, and his heart ached to share the good news about how the CEO had gone to such great expense to provide a free ticket to any Wild Thing that would trust him and accept the gift. He tapped the stirrer on the table and tried to think how best to respond. \"KW, if what you say is true why would the CEO have written the travel guide? If you read it carefully you'll see it really has only one message. Is it likely he'll just change his mind and ignore everything he's ever said? He's explained everything very clearly and I don't think it makes sense for us to assume he'll do what we think is best. If that was the reality of it he would have let everyone know a long time ago. I mean, there are rules and all, and that's just the way it is. You can't fly without a ticket, you can't hope to buy one and yet you can have one for free if you know how to ask. The CEO can't just set aside his rules because his word is everything to him, but he did figure out a way for us Wild Things to get home by paying for our ticket himself. The agent told me he had to spend his son's entire inheritance. Really, you can't begin to imagine what it cost him.\" She opened her mouth to speak but stopped and instead took a sip of coffee. There was an awkward silence between them. \"It's been good talking with you Alexander, but you probably want to get going. I know we'll see each other again soon, on the island. You get there your way and I'll find my own means.\" \"KW, it's not my way. I have no means to get there, and neither do you. I don't know the way home from here, do you? We need that plane, and the free ticket to get on it. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with me, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.\" She pursed her lips and looked away for a moment. \"I don't see how you can be so sure you're right and I'm wrong\". He leaned toward her and his voice was gentle but earnest. \"KW, This isn't about who's right or wrong. This is about us getting home. It's about truth.\" \"Truth is relative, Alexander. You keep your truth and I'll keep mine.\" He put down the stirrer and reached into the small knapsack he used to carry his few meager belongings and took out a small book and placed it on the table. \"Here's my copy of the travel guide. Will you at least read it?\" He placed both of his hands on the book and slowly pushed it across the table toward her. She was moved by his sincerity but also a bit irritated at his dogged persistence. Poor Alexander, he was so gullible. \"Thanks for this. I'll read it when I have time.\" The two Wild Things sat in silence for a few long seconds, looking at one another across the small table. People of all creeds, tongues, and nationalities swarmed around them. A few glanced toward the two strange creatures but most seemed not to notice or care. Alexander looked around at the multitude of people, running to and fro, and wondered who they were, where they had come from and where they were going. \"All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned, every one, to his own way\" he said softly. KW narrowed her eyes. \"That's a very odd thing to say. What made you think of it? Besides, it's fine for everyone to do things their own way. Like in that song.\" He started to reply but a sound caught his ear. Looking up he noticed the small speaker mounted on the ceiling above them. \"All passengers with a ticket for flight J-316 will please prepare to make their way to gate 77.\" \"KW, there's even less time than I thought. You heard the announcement. Please, will you walk with me? We'll find an agent and you can ask the CEO for a ticket.\" KW frowned with a puzzled expression. \"What announcement? I didn't hear anything.\" Alexander stared at her in silence, and she was surprised by the look of sadness in his eyes. \"Why the long face?\" she said. \"I'll think about what you told me.\" KW extended her hand and he took it in both of his. \"Make sure you find the way home\" he said softly\" and gave her hand a gentle squeeze. \"Everything's fine. Alexander, we're family and I know you care about me, just as I care about you, but please don't worry about me. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.\" \"OK, KW\" he lied. Not worry about her? He'd rather rip off his horns than imagine the island without her. But somehow he knew the CEO might send agents to help her find the way. If only he wasn't the least of all the Wild Things; perhaps he could do more to help her. He only hoped he hadn't made things worse with his clumsy attempt to share the good news he had found. KW patted his arm with her free hand. \"Take care, Alexander. I'll see you later, at home.\" He forced a weak smile and reluctantly released her hand. \"There's nothing in all the world I'd like more.\" She brushed her long hair away from her face as she stood, then smiled at him warmly. \"Bye for now.\" Alexander stood as she did and watched her until she became lost in the crowded main passageway. \"Bye KW. I love you. Please get home safely.\" He looked down and noticed her half empty cup of coffee on the table, heaved a deep sigh, then picked up his knapsack and turned to make his way toward the narrow passageway, and gate 77. In an office high above the crowded airport the CEO looked at a bank of monitors mounted on one wall. His piercing eyes followed the goat-like Wild Thing as he slowly shuffled along, head down, clearly dejected. The CEO smiled and his kind face shone with benevolence, dignity and all authority. \"Take heart, Alexander\" he said, still looking at the monitor, \"KW is known to me, and I will send agents to help her find the way\". In the narrow passageway Alexander paused and pricked up his ears. Had he heard a voice speak to him? No, there wasn't really a voice, yet it seemed as if someone had spoken to him, and for some reason it gave him comfort. He felt the anxiety draining from him like water through his fingers and knew that KW would not be alone. He looked up and for the first time noticed the skylights above the passageway. The day had been overcast, and as he watched the dark clouds parted and a dazzling azure sky came into view. Alexander closed his eyes and felt the warm sunshine envelope him, the brilliant, golden light seeming almost to electrify his fur into a dazzling white. Peace beyond all understanding fell upon him like a gentle rain. He opened his eyes and thought again of KW, and of the day when they would be together again, at home, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light he saw no shadow of another parting from her. Author's note: The last part of the last sentence is of course borrowed from the closing sentence of Charles Dickens' \"Great Expectations\". It is perhaps my favorite ending to any of his novels and I have long wanted to use it in a story. My thanks to Mr. Dickens (who is currently at home) for the use of the line.

Hello, everybody! this story actually takes place during my upcoming WTWTA fic where Aunt Claire visits and takes Rina shopping with Judith and Ira! I would like to point out that this fic is not a slam against those who like to eat RR, just a commentary on their fry refills LOL! It's just a random idea I came up with when I was having a funny conversation with my dad about healthy eating habits! Disclaimer: I do not own Max, the WT's, or Aunt Claire (Max's sister), but Rina is my OC. While Aunt Claire (Max's older sister), took Rina, Judith, and Ira to the Stallion's Run Mall, Max had taken Alex, Douglas, Carol, KW, and Daniel to the Red River shopping center on the other side of the freeway. Max and Aunt Claire had made plans for the two contingents to meet at a specific time. Happy that Aunt Claire had taken Rina on an outing, he suggested to his group that they break for lunch at the new Red Robin restaurant in the Red River shopping center's food court. Carol, KW, Douglas, and Daniel liked this idea, but Alex was leery of trying new eating places. \"We've never been there before, Max,\" Alex said quaveringly. \"Is it a good place? Do they like big, furry things?\" He was beginning to wish that Judith were there, so he could hide behind her back and snuzzle into her fur. A McDonald's employee once stared at him the whole time he was eating, so he was nervous about going in amongst huge throngs. \"Oh, Red Robin is great, Alex! You're gonna love it!\" Max assured the little white goat Thing. \"Yeah, Alex; don't be such a chicken!\" Carol said. Hearing this, Douglas slowly turned to regard Carol with a quizzical look. Alex still wasn't too sure. \"Judith might want to come, too….\" He murmured as he followed the others. ……………. Twenty minutes later, Max and the Wild Things were sitting at a long table in Red Robin, eating what they had ordered. Alex was beginning to like this new place. He had ordered a hamburger with French fries, and was reaching for some ketchup and salt to flavor them a little bit. Douglas, who was seated near the condiments, noticed this and grabbed some ketchup for Alex, but instead of salt, he snatched up a shaker full of Red Robin's special seasoning. \"Here, Alexander, try some of this! It's their special seasoning!\" Douglas told Alex as he handed the shaker to him. \"I've tried some already and it's really delicious!\" Alex wasn't one to rush into things headlong, however, and he took a taste of the stuff first. He smacked his lips and decided he did like it! He began seasoning his burger and French fries with great enthusiasm. Poor KW, who was seated right next to him, twitched her nose and reached over to unfold her napkin. She held it to her fuzzy little pug nose and sneezed. \"Ah….ah…ah…AHHHH…Ah-CHOO!\" Max, who was sitting next to her digging into some chili, turned around to look at his favorite Wild Thing aside from Carol. \"Gesundheit, KW!\" he said politely. KW sniffled. \"Thanks, Max,\" she replied. \"Alex is getting REALLY carried away with the seasoning over there.\" Max shrugged. \"Well, he seems to have lost his fear of new places, anyway.\" Alex's French fries lasted about three minutes. By this time, all the Wild Things were finishing up their meals, and leaning back in their chairs, belching and patting their furry bellies with satisfaction. Just then, their waiter breezed by their table. Max was about to ask for the check when he discovered that the waiter was carrying a new plate of French fries stacked about 5 inches high. The waiter cheerfully plunked the plate of fries in front of Alex and went on his way. \"...Wow, you get free refills on fries in this place,\" Carol remarked, looking over at Alex's embarrassment of riches. Alex licked his lips and reached for the seasoning. \"Oh, no, not that stuff again,\" KW moaned. \"Alex, don't tell me you're going to eat those, too!\" Max cried. \"That's too much! You'll get a tummyache!\" \"It wouldn't be too much for Judith if she were here,\" Alex retorted. \"Judith can eat as much as she wants without getting a tummyache. She's got the biggest appetite of all of us Wild Things!\" \"She does, too!\" Douglas affirmed. \"Once she got into my house when I wasn't looking, and ate some of the rocks I had stored away!\" KW made a \"Pffft\" sound and rolled her eyes. \"Eaters,\" she muttered under her breath. Max leaned around KW to look meaningfully at Alex. \"Alex, just because they give you a huge thing of French fries doesn't mean you have to eat them! Restaurants always give their customers more than is healthy to eat!\" \"But they're so good!\" Alex said, shaking more spice onto his fries. \"Ah - Choo!\" sneezed KW. Douglas reached across the table to hand her a fresh napkin. Max tossed up his hands and sank into his chair. \"OK, I give up. Eat the fries. If there's one thing I've learned, it's never argue with a Wild Thing! You end up either epically losing or being swallowed whole!\" Carol frowned at Max. \"Golly, Max. You're no fun now that you're a grownup.\" \"Yeah, well...\" Max replied, bracing his hand against his forehead. After Alex finished off his second helping of fries, he began to look and feel a little greenish. Daniel noticed and poked Max in the shoulder. \"What?\" Max asked him. \"HHHMMMMPPppphhh,\" Daniel snorted urgently and pointed at Alex. Max looked over at Alex and chuckled slightly. \"Well, Alex, looks like you overdid those fries a little bit, hmmmm?\" \"Naw, Max, I'm fine, really I- *hiccup* *hiccup* *BURP*- am!\" Alex insisted. \"You've had enough, Alex,\" Douglas said sternly in his best father's voice. \"Hey, Alexander, I didn't know you could change colors!\" Carol gaped, referring to Alex's pallor. At this point, KW started scooting away from the queasy little goat for fear that all his fries would invite themselves up for a visit. \"Okay, you guys, we're going to go meet Aunt Claire at the other shopping mall now,\" Max told the Wild Things. \"Rina, Judith, and Ira are there with them.\" \"Aunt Claire? Isn't she the one who didn't believe you when you told her about us?\" Carol asked. \"I'm not sure if I wanna see HER again.\" \"Don't worry, Carol, I think she's sorry for dissing my stories now that she's seen you guys in person,\" Max laughed. Alex was starting to feel a bit better, so Max paid the check and they all set out for Stallion's Run, to meet Aunt Claire, Rina, Judith, and Ira. Rina came running up to her father with a big shopping bag when she saw him. \"Well, Rina, looks like you did some shopping!\" Max noted. \"Whaja buy?\" Judith came up next to Rina and grinned at her. \"You want to tell him, or should I?\" Rina asked. \"You do it; it was your idea,\" Judith told her. Rina then fished a box of cookies out of the bag. \"Judy and I bought the cookie diet, Daddy!\" she announced. Alex perked up immediately. \"Hey, COOL!\" he said. Max covered his face with both hands. \"OH, NO!\" The End ","Summary":" The Dangerous French Fries!!!!! Hello, everybody! this story actually takes place during my upcomin"},{"Movie":"Where the Wild Things Are","Title":"The Cask of Anorthosite","Author":"Quod scripsi","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6632353","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Edgar Allan Poe ranks among my favorite 19th Century authors. A few nights ago, after reading his 1846 short story \"The Cask of Amontillado\" and then watching the dirt clod war scenes from \"Where the Wild Things Are\" the strangest thing happened. I dreamed that Alexander had at last reached the limits of what he will tolerate from the other Wild Things and decided it was time to repay Douglas for the dirt clod incident – and in Poe Style! Who knew Alexander was so literary and articulate? I always said that goat boy is far cleverer than any of us might have imagined. If Carol isn't careful he may end up under the floorboards, or walled up with a black cat. Good thing Max is out of the picture. Actually, I don't think Alexander has a cruel bone in his body and could never really hurt anyone. Perhaps this is just one of his day dreams. I assume anyone reading this (if anyone ever reads it) has watched the movie. But since the entire premise of the story relies upon one brief scene in the film I'll just mention it for clarity. During the scenes in which Max surveys the perimeter of the fort Carol carries Douglas as a means of measurement and asks him what he has been eating, to which Douglas replies \"rocks\". So, rocks are substituted for Amontillado and other wine since I just can't see the Wild Thinks drinking sherry. If this point is missed the story will make absolutely no sense to the reader…not that it will anyway, but – well, you know what I mean. Disclaimer: The below story is essentially Poe's \"The Cask of Amontillado\" with only a very few revisions. These works is a parody of, and salute to, Edgar Allan Poe, as well as a tribute to my favorite WT, Alexander. I do not claim to have written this story, only to have slightly changed it in order to create a parody. I think \"The Cask of Amontillado\" must be in the public domain, but if I suddenly disappear from the site you'll know FanFiction did not approve. Alexander, Douglas and Max are also not my creations or property, although I do consider Alexander to be one of my best fictional, non-human, semi-goat friends and would very much like to take him to Red Robin for fries and a cup of coffee. Or a salad, whatever he wants. (For those of us that are not geologists, Anorthosite is a type of intrusive igneous rock composed predominantly of calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar…but everyone probably already knew that.) The Cask of Anorthosite By Edgar Alexander Goat The thousand injuries of Douglas I had borne as I best could (frigging dirt clods), but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, and how I can become upset but then just as quickly calm down, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. AT LENGTH I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled - but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. It's a Wild Thing thing, you might not understand. It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Douglas cause to doubt my good will. I continued as was my wont, to smile in his face and not call him chicken, and he did not perceive that my smile NOW was at the thought of his chastisement. He had a weak point - this Douglas - although in other regards he was a Wild Thing to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in rocks. Few Wild Things have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practice imposture upon the non-Wild Thing animals on the island. In not eating things that irritated him, Douglas, like his fellow Wild Things, was a quack, but in the matter of fine rocks he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially; I was skilful in the exotic rocks myself, and bought largely whenever I could. It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the island carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much sand. The bird wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his one good hand. I said to him - \"My dear Douglas, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking today! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Anorthosite, and I have my doubts.\" \"How?\" said he, \"Anorthosite? A pipe? Impossible ? And in the middle of the carnival?\" \"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full Anorthosite price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain. Bob and Terry are not hesitant to practice the art of the hard sell\" \"Anorthosite!\" \"I have my doubts.\" \"Anorthosite!\" \"And I must satisfy them.\" \"Anorthosite!\" \"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Ira. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me\" - \"Ira cannot tell Anorthosite from Syenite.\" \"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\" \"Come let us go.\" \"Whither?\" \"To your goat cave.\" \"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement -\" \"I have no engagement; come.\" \"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The caves are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\" \"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Anorthosite! You have been imposed upon; and as for Ira, he cannot distinguish Syenite from Anorthosite.\" Thus speaking, Douglas possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my horns, I suffered him to hurry me to my abode. There were no raccoon attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned. Little masked bastards, even thought I wanted and expected them to disobey me and depart it still angers me. One simply can't find quality help on this island. I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Douglas bowed him through several suites of huts to the archway that led into the cave. I passed down a long and winding ramp, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Alexanders. The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode. \"The pipe,\" said he. \"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.\" He turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication. \"Nitre?\" he asked, at length \"Nitre,\" I replied. \"How long have you had that cough?\" \"Ugh! ugh! ugh! - ugh! ugh! ugh! - ugh! ugh! ugh! - ugh! ugh! ugh! - ugh! ugh! ugh! My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes. \"It is nothing,\" he said, at last. \"Come,\" I said, with decision, we will go back; your health is precious. You are respected, admired, beloved, and not ignored all the damn time; you are happy as once I was. You are a Wild Thing to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Ira\" - \"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\" \"True - true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily - but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Marble will defend us from the damps.\" Here I knocked off a few grains of fine Marble which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould. \"Take these,\" I said, presenting him the small rocks. He raised them to his beak with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled. \"I eat,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\" \"And I to your long life.\" He again took my arm and we proceeded. \"These vaults,\" he said, are extensive.\" \"The Alexanders,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family - I am the last.\" \"I forget your arms.\" \"A huge goat foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a troll-like creature that looks very much like Carol whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\" \"And the motto?\" \"Nemo caper impune lacessit.\" (No one provokes the Goat with impunity) \"Good!\" he said. The Marble sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the same. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Douglas by the arm above the elbow, which is not easy to do because of all the feathers. \"The nitre!\" I said: see it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough\" - \"It is nothing\" he said; \"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Marble.\" I broke and reached him a handful of de Vermont sand. He downed it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the grains upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand. I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement - a grotesque one. \"You do not comprehend?\" he said. \"Not I,\" I replied. \"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\" \"How?\" \"You are not of the Maxists.\" \"Yes, yes,\" I said \"yes! yes.\" \"You? Impossible! A Maxist?\" \"A Maxist,\" I replied. \"A sign,\" he said. \"It is this,\" I answered, producing a scepter from beneath the folds of my roquelaire. \"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"But let us proceed to the Anorthosite.\" \"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the scepter beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Anorthosite. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame. At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with remains piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of some great city somewhere (you fill in the blank). Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height eight or nine. Just large enough to accommodate a giant chicken like thing (wow, that's handy). It was in vain that Douglas, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see. \"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Anorthosite. As for Ira\" - \"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend (that's hateful!), as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a stick lock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing, I stepped back from the recess. \"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is VERY damp. Once more let me IMPLORE you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\" \"The Anorthosite!\" exclaimed my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment. \"True,\" I replied; \"the Anorthosite.\" As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building sticks and mud. With these materials and with the aid of the scepter, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche. I had scarcely laid the first tier when I discovered that the intoxication of Douglas had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was NOT the cry of one that was drunk. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the scepter, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the wooden barrier, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within. A succession of loud and shrill howls, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated - I trembled. Unsheathing my sharpened stick knife, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the cave walls, running my claws over the rough stone, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the howls of him who clamored. I reechoed - I aided - I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still. It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single bundle of sticks to be fitted and mudded in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon by entire body. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Douglas. The voice said - \"Ha! ha! ha! - he! he! - a very good joke indeed - an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the fort - he! he! he! - over our rocks - he! he! he!\" \"The Anorthosite!\" I said. \"He! he! he! - he! he! he! - yes, the Anorthosite . But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the fort, the Lady Judith, and the rest? Let us be gone.\" \"Yes,\" I said \"let us be gone.\" \"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, ALEXANDER!\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\" But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud - \"Douglas!\" No answer. I called again - \"Douglas!\" No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. I think he had laid an egg. My heart grew sick - on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last sticks into position; I mudded them up. Against the new wall I re-erected the old rampart of bones and horns. For the half of a week no mortal has disturbed them. Of course I'll let him out in a little while. I'm a goat-like Wild Thing, not a cold-blooded murderer. But now let's see if anyone disrespects me! Mess with the goat and you get the horns. In pace requiescat – for at least a few days. ","Summary":" Edgar Allan Poe ranks among my favorite 19th Century authors.

Just a little oneshot very loosely based on my favorite scence from Where the Wild Things Are: when Max talks to Alexander after the dirt clod fight. In my opinion, Max could (and should) have handled the situation much better than he did. My character is a girl, and intended to be older than Max, even though her age is unstated. It doesn't stay true to the plot of the movie, fair warning. Reviews would be tremendously appreciated :) I do not own Where The Wild Things are (book or movie) and therefore none of the rights. The only thing I own is my own character. *** All she wanted to do was to make them happy. To be a source of comfort for them, and to help them pull their scattered lives back together, but somehow it hadn't worked. Now she felt like the best thing she could do for them was to leave. It broke her heart, it left her feeling listless and useless, as if all this time with them would eventually amount to nothing, if it had ever really amounted to anything at all. She'd leave, and eventually, her presence there would fade into the background, and settle into nothing but a periodic absent minded thought that would be quickly brushed away to make room for the more pressing and insistent matters of the present. Where that would leave her, though, was an entirely different matter. Even though things were falling apart, she couldn't stop thinking about them. She loved them; they had truly become her family. She felt at home there, like she belonged, like she was, for the first time, with people like herself; cherished, welcomed, and wanted. She had been wandering, and found herself walking along the beach, and following her feet to a rocky alcove along the shoreline. She meandered inside, hoping to just stop there for a few moments and think. However, it was not long before she realized that she was not alone. Edging past the entrance to the cave, she saw a smallish figure hunched near the back of the pocket of rock. It was Alexander. Slowly, she approached him, cautious of any possible accusations or all-too-deserving insults but, to her surprise, the only acknowledgement he gave was a sidelong glance over his shoulder before he seemed to fold back in on himself again. His general posture and utterly apathetic attitude made her twinge with sympathy. Swallowing a nervous lump in her throat, she approached the goat creature. As she came closer, he gave no further indication that her presence mattered to him. Gingerly, she sat down on the rock floor beside him, close, but not too close. She heard him sigh. Trying and failing to find something profound or generally apologetic to say, she settled on stating the first thing that came to her mind in order to break the stifling silence that seemed to descend between them. \" No one really seems to listen to you much, do they?\" she stated in what she hoped was a gentle voice, meant not to insult him or deter him from possibly speaking to her. Alexander laughed once from his nose, a self-loathing, pitiful sound. \"You noticed?\" he said rhetorically. Anna couldn't find a reply for his simple statement. Fighting to remain calm and passive, she let her eyes roam around the dimly lit little cavern, eventually resting back on Alexander. There, on his right upper arm, the one closest to her, she could see a sizeable area of hair matted down with dried blood. It looked painful, and when she examined his posture further she found that he was indeed favoring that arm. She edged a fraction closer to him, bending her head to look at the wound clearly. \"What happened?\" she asked, even though she was fairly sure she already knew how it occurred. Alexander cocked his head. His voice was small and it cracked. \"When you told them to tackle me,\" he answered. Anna studied him further then, and wondered why she had not thought of the consequences of the act of which he spoke. It was true. Yesterday it had been so good. The sun was out, there was a crisp breeze coming in from the ocean, and they all felt energetic and alive. Running and playing on the shore turned into playful dodging and tackling. Alexander had been watching from the sidelines, and Nora wanted him to get in on the fun, and so she encouraged some of the others to extend their seemingly harmless roughhousing to include him. Even afterwards, Alexander still didn't seem keen on the impromptu game, so Anna had let him wander off, not wishing to push him, but sad that he didn't want to join in. Now that she realized he had abandoned the game for a legitimate reason, it filled her with guilt and regret. \" I'm sorry, Alexander,\" she said softly, knowing that her token apology would not be enough. He seemed so sad, so neglected and alone. She quickly got up, knowing on instinct that he wouldn't be leaving any time soon. As she quickly walked out to the open air again, she began to tear two strips off the bottom of her stretched out t-shirt. Just as she had completed the task, she reached the small freshwater stream she had discovered the previous day. She knelt down and soaked the two strips in the cool, clear water, got up, and quickly returned to the little inlet. Alexander had heard her coming back, and, startled and incredulous, he stared at her returning figure, which apparently proved opposite to his suspicions that she had left him there by himself. Anna came into the cave and seated herself next to him again. Laying the strips of cloth across her lap, she looked again at his arm. \"Can I see?\" she asked softly. Alexander haltingly obliged, angling his upper arm in Anna's direction. She took it gently in her hands, feeling the wiry hairs of his coat thread themselves through her fingers. She took one strip of damp cloth and began to tease the dried blood out of both his coat and the wound. She felt his warm breath puffing erratically out of his muzzle, and she could feel his arm trembling slightly. \"Alright…it's alright,\" she murmured low and soft, and she thought she sensed him relax slightly. The process of cleaning the wound was proving to be a tedious one, as she was trying to wash the dried blood away without scrubbing too harshly, while making sure the area was clear at the same time. Soon, the first strip of cloth was too dirty to use any longer, and she placed it on the ground, and picked up the second. Another ten or so minutes passed, and Alexander's arm was starting to look better. The wound itself, while it was the size of Anna's closed fist, was not deep. However, it had bled a lot, and Anna had found herself cleaning sand and grit out of the injury as well. Finally, the sizeable scrape was clean, and the surrounding hair was again white. There were some clean areas of the second cloth left, and it was still pleasantly cool. She pressed it against the wound, as she was sure the cold sensation of it would feel good to him. She soothingly encircled it with both of her hands, applying a small amount of pressure. Alexander heaved a big sigh, and as Anna looked up at him, she found him to have closed his eyes. Patiently waiting for him to reopen them, she stayed still, her hands softly around his upper arm. Eventually, he opened his eyes, fixing them on her own. \" Thank you,\" he said with a note of surprise clearly audible in his voice. Anna offered what degree of a smile she could muster back to him. \" I didn't know…\" she started. \"I just…I just wanted to make everyone happy.\" Alexander continued to study her face, his large yellow animal eyes curiously tracing her features. \"You're not a queen.\" It was not an accusation. The corners of his wide mouth turned up very slightly. \"That's ok. I don't think they really exist anyway.\" Anna could never explain it, but that simple statement reassured her like no other could have done. She shifted her grasp on his arm, slowly removing the damp piece of cotton. To her relief, the wound had not bled any more. Standing up, she tore yet another piece from her now sadly sacrificed t-shirt. When she was finished, she wound the strip several times around Alexander's arm, ending with a knot, the makeshift bandage keeping the wound clean until it began to heal. Anna then took a step away from Alexander, wordlessly inviting him to stand. As he did so, they both faced the opening of the cave, looking toward the open ocean, with distant white flecks of sea birds wheeling far above the waves. Anna felt the rough warmth of Alexander's coat against the bare skin of her arm as they started to walk side by side to the shoreline. A gentle breeze came in from the ocean, ruffling Anna's hair and Alexander's fur in turn. Anna encircled his waist with one arm as he curled his good arm around her shoulders. \" Will we always be friends?\" she heard him ask. Anna pressed her face a little further into his warm fur. \"Always,\" she replied. ","Summary":" Hey everyone, this is my first story.

Welcome to my official WTWTA fanfic!!! I don't own the WTs or Max, but I own Rina and Tracy. 'K? 'K. Have fun reading!! Chapter 1: The Babysitter The longer the Wild Things stayed with Rina and her father, Max, the more Carol realized that he LOVED….peanut butter. Every morning, quietly as he could manage, he would slip downstairs and go to the pantry, where he knew the peanut butter jar was kept. He'd take out the jar, unscrew the lid, and dip one of his claws in to get a big dollop of the stuff. Max soon found this out and called him on it. \"YUCK! Why is there FUR in my peanut butter?!\" Max demanded one afternoon when he was fixing a quick sandwich. \"It's not your peanut butter,\" Carol said defensively, \"It's all of ours.\" Rina walked over to Carol and tugged on his paw to distract him from a meltdown. \"I didn't know you liked peanut butter, Carol,\" she said. \"D'you like the chunky kind, the smooth kind, or the kind that has jelly or chocolate syrup mixed in?\" \"Oh, all of those kinds sound good to me, Little Cub!\" Carol replied, giving Rina a big hug. Rina snuggled into his warm, soft tickle- tummy. Aside from Judith, Carol was her favorite Wild Thing. He always called her \"Little Cub\" affectionately, and understood her when she was angry or sad; probably because he often felt angry or sad himself. Carol was prone to cycling moods, and even threw temper tantrums when his feelings were hurt, or if he hadn't gotten enough sleep. However, he hadn't suffered a meltdown since his checkup at the veterinarian the week before. \"I have to attend parent-teacher conferences later on, Rina,\" Max announced as he fished long strands of creature fur out of the peanut butter. \"So, you-well, all of you-are going to have a babysitter tonight.\" \"No one's gonna sit on us! If they try, I'll eat 'em up!\" Carol snarled as he held Rina closer. Max gripped the edge of the counter and sighed in a world-weary manner. \"No, Carol, no; a babysitter is someone who comes to look after kids if their parents can't be there.\" \"Why can't all seven of us just stay here on our own?\" Rina suggested hopefully. \"Carol and Judith will make sure I'm safe! Besides, a babysitter won't let us DO anything!\" \"Oh, I think you're way off on that call, Rina,\" Max replied with a sly smile. \"One of my students at the high school is going to be sitting for you. Her name is Tracy, and she's eighteen and graduating at the end of this year.\" \"Is she nice? Will she like us?\" Carol asked nervously. \"We'll see!\" Max replied gaily as he took his lunch into the living room. Carol and Rina exchanged worried glances. \"We have a baby-sitter tonight, guys,\" Rina announced to the rest of the Wild Things. \"Baby sitter? That's not someone who sits on babies, is it?\" Alexander the goat asked nervously. Rina giggled. \"No, Alexander, no! A baby-sitter's just somebody like an older kid who comes over to stay with you when your parents aren't there!\" \"Well, why can't we look after you?\" Judith asked belligerently. \"That's what we do. You're our little cub, not anyone else's!\" \"Judy, please,\" the sweet, mellow Ira soothed the hot-tempered, rhino-cow-lioness hybrid. \"Will the sitter be nice, Rina?\" Rina widened her eyes and let her breath out. \"I dunno, you guys. Sometimes, like on TV, babysitters aren't that nice.\" \"Uh, oh! Maybe we should hide!\" Ira exclaimed, scooting behind Judith and covering his eyes with the brushlike tip of her tail. \"You don't have to tell me twice!\" Alexander bleated, ducking behind the Monsters, Inc. standee depicting Mike and Sully that stood in a corner of Rina's room. Douglas gritted his teeth and swept up Russel, his beloved cat. Before the other five Wild Things could hide, the doorbell rang! Everyone gave a yelp of surprise (Even Judith!), and Russel hissed at the intrusive sound. Rina glanced up at Carol fearfully. Carol looked down at her, unsure of what to say. He was scared, too, but she was his little cub, and needed his protection. Carol knew what had to be done. He cleared his throat, gave a deep sniff, scooped up Rina and placed her on top of his furry head. \"It'll be okay, Little Cub,\" he reassured her. \"If things start to go wrong, I'll eat her up.\" \"Well, hey there, you guys!\" Tracy greeted Rina and Carol at the front door. \"Hi,\" Rina said politely. Carol simply leaned forward and began sniffing Tracy for inspection. Although Ira would have loved to dispute him, Carol knew he had the nose best suited for smelling things. Whereas Ira's was slightly large, Carol's was relatively small, bubblegum pink in color, and sported three scratches on the very tip from an encounter with Richard the raccoon. Despite its small size, Carol's nose was still perfectly suited to sniffing the air for signs of danger, and the occasional sneeze when it happened to encounter dust, squirrel fur, or one of Douglas's feathers. Carol felt Rina fidget embarrassedly on top of his head, but ignored it. \"I-I'm sorry, it's just something he does to get to know people,\" she explained to Tracy, who just stood there smiling as Carol gave her his going-over. \"Oh, I don't mind! I think he's cute!\" Tracy exclaimed. Then, catching Carol completely off guard, she ventured her hand over to tickle his broad tummy. \"Come on, big guy! I can tell you're ticklish! Won't you laugh for me?\" she teased Carol as a giddy, winding smile broke out all over his face. No matter how he tried to fight it, he could feel his tail starting to swish back and forth, his toes start to curl and uncurl, and gooseflesh ripple from the tickled area of his tummy. His tummy was so ticklish. He pleaded for mercy as best he could with his eyes, to no avail. \"Aw, c'mon now, cut that out!\" he squeaked out between giggles and guffaws. \"Pick on somebody your own size!\" \"Holler uncle, hairball!\" Tracy cried playfully as she toppled him over onto his back, where he howled and laughed uproariously and kicked his feet in the air. \"Well, I see you've managed to win Carol over, Tracy!\" Max marveled as he walked in the corridor all dressed for conferences. \"Oh, sure! I LOVE animals, but I can't have any at home because both my parents are allergic to every kind of animal fur!\" Tracy said regretfully. She then looked down at Rina and mouthed the words, \"It sucks,\" and grinned mischievously. Rina smiled. She hadn't expected the babysitter to be as nice as this! Then she sobered and leaned forward to tell Tracy their secret. \"Uh, Tracy? Is it okay if we just keep it a secret that Carol and the other Wild Things are actually real? Till now, we've just told everybody that they're teenagers in Halloween costumes!\" \"Oh, sure!\" Tracy replied, patting her on the shoulder. \"Wow, they're REAL creatures? That's so cool! Where'd they come from?\" \"We sailed here on the boat,\" Carol explained, pulling himself up and trying to catch his breath from laughing. \"The boat that Rina uses to come visit us on our island.\" \"Wow…uh, okay!\" Tracy answered. \"After discovering that there are huge furry beast-thingies that really do exist, I can believe anything!\" Soon, the other six Wild things filed downstairs to investigate the babysitter. \"Rina, have we met your new friend here?\" Judith asked, eying Tracy with an air of suspicion. \"Judy, this is Tracy!\" Rina said, gesturing towards the teenager. \"Oh…My…God, you are SO CUTE!\" Tracy gushed at Judith. \"I LOVE your sad-looking puppy-dog eyes!!!!\" Judith raised her eyebrows. \"I have cute sad-looking puppy-dog eyes?\" she asked, with a fanged smile tickling the corners of her mouth. \"I know, Tracy,\" Ira said, nodding at Judith with a smile. \"I couldn't ask for anything more.\" \"Hello, Tracy! The name's Douglas!\" Douglas exclaimed, bounding over with his paw extended for a handshake. Tracy smiled and shook it. \"My name's Tracy, Douglas, and I'm going to be your sitter tonight!\" she replied. \"Wonderful handshake, young lady, simply wonderful!\" Douglas praised her, laughing. Tracy looked away slightly, smiling bashfully. \"Why, thank you.\" Then Tracy happened to notice Alexander standing off by himself, as though he didn't really know what to make of the new sitter. Tracy smiled at him and said, \"Well, hi there! What's your name, little buddy?\" \"Ummm... Alexander,\" Alex replied, smiling a little bit. \"Hi, Tracy. You won't sit on us, will you?\" Tracy slapped her knees and gave a snort of laughter. \"You guys are so funny! Of course, I'm not gonna sit on you!! The phrase \"baby-sitter\" just means that I watch you guys and do fun stuff with you!\" Alex looked relieved. \"Oh, good!\" Judith leaned over to Tracy. \"Fun stuff, huh? You ever heard of rumpuses?\" Tracy blinked. \"I'm sorry; of what?\" Rina couldn't have been happier. Everyone seemed to be getting along just fine, and now they had made a new friend to share their secret world with.

Welc"},{"Movie":"Where the Wild Things Are","Title":"For Just Being You","Author":"Lil' Pink Coupe","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5946546","Passage":"[Chapter 1] For Just Being You Chapter 1 Author's Note: Yay!! My alter ego gets to go Where the Wild Things Are!! I just wanted to mention that beforehand, and also that the evnts described in the first couple of paragraphs have actually been happening in my life right now. Enjoy!! Pink was always tortured by acute anxiety, especially on the days when her parents approached her, asking to see her grades on the school website. Her parents always tried the hardest to reassure their daughter that it did not really matter if the grades she currently had were good or bad; she would always get them back up again, and when she had reached middle age (as they had) she would look back on the whole circumstance and realize that it had not really been that important. Still, that did not change the fact that all the things Pink worried about were always still there, no matter how much reassurance she was given. In fact, the there – ness of all the things Pink dreaded persisted to the point where she suffered an anxiety – induced blackout on a Tuesday morning; a day when she knew they would ask for her grades. \"College isn't everything,\" Pink's stepmother reassured her. \"Lots of kids stop going after a year or two. My stepson did the same thing! Why, he only went to college because I made him! It's whatever you decide is best.\" I wonder how long she's going to buy her own false reassurances, Pink mused to herself. For years now, her parents had dreamed of her being an academic success. At the age of ten, she was knocked over the head with the threat of her father having apoplexy if she decided anything against their wishes for furthering her education. All this made her wonder at the sudden change in tone. One afternoon, as Pink walked meditatively down the sidewalk near her house, she heard a squeaky sort of noise; such as the kind of noise a duck would make. She looked up into the boughs of the tree she stood next to in order to get a better look at this duck. However, when she looked up into the tree, she did not see a duck, but rather a very cute – looking snowy owl with ruffled feathers. \"Why, hello, you cute little owl,\" Pink greeted it. The owl squeaked two times and cocked its head to one side in order to get a better look at her. \"I'm all right,\" Pink assured the owl. Somehow the owl gave the impression that it wanted an explanation of some kind for her being out for a walk. \"I've just got a lot to deal with right now, and I'm probably a head case, even though no one will come right out and say it. I have fainting spells because I get nervous.\" The owl's forehead seemed to furrow, and it fluffed out the feathers around its neck. \"That's odd,\" Pink observed. \"You seem to be able to understand what I'm talking about. But, I mean, how can you? If you'll forgive me for saying so, you're only an owl.\" The owl stared at her briefly, and then spread its wings to fly out of the tree. As it flew ahead, it looked back at Pink, as though it wanted her to follow behind. \"You want me to follow you?\" Pink asked the owl. The owl squeaked once more in an urgent sort of way, and began to fly off again. \"Wait for me!\" Pink cried, rushing after the owl. \"Where are we going?\" The owl led her to the area of the neighborhood where a creek lay. The owl swooped down under the bridge that lay over it, and Pink followed after it. In doing so, she encountered two surprises: one; there was another owl waiting there for them, and two, there was a small boat floating near the shore of the creek. \"Huh,\" Pink murmured, inspecting the small boat. \"I've never noticed this here before. Maybe some kids left it here.\" The owl that had been waiting there turned to the other owl and said in squeaky owl – speak: She's clueless. She can't be the one that the Horned – Nose saw in her vision. The owl that had led Pink there replied, Don't worry, Bob. I'm very good at following descriptions. I know this is the right girl. Besides, from the way she talked, she needs to do something like this. The other owl rolled its eyes and replied, Okay, Terry, but you know that if she turns out to be the wrong one, the Horned – Nose is probably just gonna swallow us whole like the problems she thinks we are. Pink approached the two perching owls warily. \"Are you two arguing or something?\" Both of the owls squeaked at this, and flew over to the small boat, which they promptly nestled in, side by side. \"Aw, are you two going somewhere?\" Pink asked them, admiring how cute they looked. At this, the first owl gently latched onto Pink's jacket with its talons, and guided her over to the boat. \"Oh, you want me to go with you guys?\" Pink asked. Both owls squeaked affirmatively. Pink sighed. \"Well, okay, but let's not be gone for too long. I have school tomorrow.\" As Pink and the two owls set sail in the creek, Pink glanced down at the hull of the boat and noticed the name \"Max\" carved into it. What in the heck can all of this mean? She thought to herself. ","Summary":" For Just Being You Chapter 1 Author's Note: Yay!! My alter ego gets to go Where the Wild Things Are"},{"Movie":"Supergirl","Title":"Kara: the Early Days","Author":"Maniac Mike","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613169","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Supergirl A few months have passed since Clark and Oliver went away. Kara got through another school year. She continued to fight crime. Thing is, The Teen Titans went away on a mission in Nevada and decided to stick around. As for The Justice League, they have their own assignment in Nevada. Garrison Denton has sent his goons out in droves over there. \"Is he attempting to take over the casino business now?\" Kara asked herself. Her phone rang. Must be Roman. Most people in town know her as Linda. Kara Zor-El is her real name. She comes from Argo City, neighbor to the planet Krypton. Here on Earth she is known as Linda Lee Danvers. On the other end of the phone Roman tells Kara how much she means to him. Roman Gibson knows her secret. As does her parents who adopted her, but love her as their own. Roman was questioning his girlfriend about the identity of the man in the bat suit. \"I love you, I did use my x-ray vision to sneak a peak, just like Kal did, but I can't reveal his true identity,\" she explained. As last seen, the ultra billionaire Bruce Wayne was seen investigating Denton's Nevada situation. At this point his costume resembled the one from Batman and Robin ( 1949). \"The man is a real good detective, can't you tell me anything?\" Roman pressed. \"Yes! The man is on our side!\" Kara responded. \"I suppose that's good enough for me then.\" Kara smiled on the other end of the phone. In her special footlocker, Kara saw that special red cape which was given to her by Clark. As she went for breakfast at the popular diner in Leesburg, she couldn't help but think of Garrison Denton. She placed her order and realized Lucas was there. He is Lex Luthor's half-brother. But unlike Lex, Lucas was actually a good guy. \"What you doing here, young lady?\" Lucas joked. \"Haven't you heard? All the cool kids hang out here.\" Kara grinned. \"And you are a cool kid, Linda!\" Lucas wasn't one of the few who knew the truth about her. Her parents, Fred and Sylvia, have said that Lucas is the only member of that family they trust. ( Note: Season four, episode seventy-seven. ) Kara looked around her surroundings. She can't believe she's been on Earth thus far. Pretty much history for both her and her cousin began too take shape in 1938. Meanwhile, in Nevada, Vandal was enjoying the new contraption which he wished for. A way-back machine of sorts where he can look into the past. Anybody's past. Any planet's past. And so he chose Krypton. Our story starts in 1938 on Argo City. This was before the time the Phantom Zone was created on their main planet of Krypton. The El family fought off villains for years. In 1942 a hero found his way into Argo City. It was Green Lantern. He fought alongside the Els and even trusted them with his secret identity of Alan Scott. By 1945 Scott/Lantern brought an ally called Flash to help matters out. The Els later found out that the Flash is Jay Garrick. By 1950 Argo City was closer to peace. 1955, a young Zor-El begins his training. In 1960 Zor-El joined his older brother Jor-El in battle. \"Green Lantern\" Alan Scott was lost in battle. In 1963 Zor-El met Alura. In 1965 Flash/Garrick returned to Argo with a new Green Lantern, Hal Jordan. The El brothers fought alongside the superheroes. In 1967 Zor-El and Alura get married. By 1970 Argo was completely at peace, but Garrick was lost during the battle. In 1972 Zor-El and Alura had a daughter, they named her Kara. 1975 Zor-El and Jor-El went to Earth to assist \"Green Lantern\" Hal Jordan and a new Flash, Barry Allen. In 1980 the citizens of Argo celebrate ten years of peace. 1982, Kara celebrates her tenth birthday. 1983 Green Lantern ( Hal Jordan ) and Flash ( Barry Allen ) were battling Abra Kadabra and his thugs. After they finally defeated them for good in 1984, they discovered Agamemno had plans for Argo. \"The world will be mine!\" vowed Vandal. \"Is that a wish, sir?\" asked the Genie. \"Not yet!\" Vandal looked on some more. Kid Flash ( Wally West ) joins the two heroes on Argo. Zor-El built an escape shuttle just in case. In 1985 Agony and Ecstacy joined in with Agamemno. 1986 Amazing Grace joined the villain team. In 1987 Amazo was the next villain to join. In Nevada… Garrison Denton was speaking to a casino owner. \"I can take your problems off your hands,\" Denton said. \"I've owned this casino for over twenty years,\" said the owner. \"Just sell it to me and these problems will disappear,\" he told him. \"It was you who did this, wasn't it?\" the guy demanded. Denton smirked. \"All I want to do is help.\" Back in Leesburg… Lucas looked at his phone. \"Linda, it says here Denton just bought the Bob Kane Casino!\" Linda almost dropped her orange juice. \"I don't believe this,\" she said. Lucas shows her his phone. \"See?\" \"What's he up to?\" \"My thoughts exactly.\" Roman had discovered the same thing by looking on the Internet. \"I think I just chose my career suggestion vocational day.\" After breakfast, Lucas walked Kara to the bus stop. Of course she'd prefer to use her super-speed, but Lucas was there. \"I would give you a ride, but I have to be in a meeting real soon,\" Lucas explained. \"No problem, I understand,\" Kara says, with a smile. When Lucas was out of range, Kara removed herself from sight, and used her super-speed. She quickly arrived at Roman's place. Roman smiled when he saw her. \"How's my beautiful super-powered girlfriend doing?\" he asked. \"She's fine,\" smiled Kara. They kissed. \"What did I do to earn such a terrific girl like yourself?\" asked Roman. They continued to kiss and fell into the couch. But with Kara's power the couch tipped over. Elsewhere in the community, we see the return of Lenny. It had been a long road for him. It had been a while since he'd seen Leslie Willis or even spoken to her. He had just about finishing getting over Kara because of Leslie. She was back on the radio, the thing she most loves. Lenny still longed for her. But which girl did he truly long for? \"During the final battle an explosive device was set off. Barry Allen went MIA. Zor-El put Kara into a deep sleep and then into the ship. Green Lantern followed the ship but got lost when an explosion went off. Kid Flash searched for him but couldn't locate him. Moments later Argo blew up.\" That's what she had told him. Lenny sat down on a park bench and a tear fell down his eye. The shuttle was frozen in time. In suspended animation. 1988 Wally West became the Flash and Guy Gardner became the Green Lantern. In 1989 it was Krypton that was destroyed. Lenny hadn't even been aware of the Green Lantern Corps until Linda, or Kara, as he came to know her, had explained to him. John Stewart had become the new Lantern around that time. 2006 Kyle Rayner becomes the Green Lantern and decides to spend some time in Leesburg. 2007 while fighting Angle Man, the shuttle crashed in an empty field, but of course did a lot of damage. After Angle Man was defeated, Lantern checked what the ruckus was all about. He opened it up and found Kara. Lenny decided to go see her. He needed to try. He loves her. Lenny had loved her. And he knew he needed to tell her. At this point we see Vandal Savage with his genie. \"I automatically want to be shaved, showered, dressed, and I don't want to bother using the bathroom, if you know what I mean,\" he ordered. \"Done!\" the Genie replied. Immediately, Vandal was all cleaned up. \"I want Garrison Denton here, now!\" Suddenly, he appeared. \"What the…?\" Denton was shocked, confused. \"Hello, old friend.\" \"Vandal?\" \"None other.\" \"But… how did I get here?\" \"Meet my very own personal genie.\" \"But how?\" Denton grinned. \"Sit and I'll explain.\" As he sat down, Garrison was looking very nervous. At this point Lenny was at the Danvers home. \"Lenny! Long time no see,\" exclaimed Fred. \"Good to see you again, Mr. Danvers,\" Lenny responded. Lenny felt this was a good sign. \"So… Where's my friend? That daughter of yours?\" asked Lenny. Fortunately for Lenny, Roman had karate class, so she was on her way back. And when she did come back home she was sure surprised to see Lenny. \"Hi, Kara,\" he said. \"I missed you.\" \"Lenny?\" she said, shocked. They hugged. \"Good to see you, Lenny.\" \"It's better seeing you,\" he responded. They went to the Danvers living room where they discussed Denton and the casinos. \"Whatever it is that you're going to do I want to help,\" said Lenny. \"You don't have to, Lenny,\" Kara said. Lenny smiles at her. \"But I want to,\" he says, \"I want to make things right between us.\" Kara gave an understanding look. \"We're good, Lenny,\" she said. \"Really.\" \"I still have strong feelings for you,\" added Lenny. Kara was afraid of this. \"But Lenny-\" And he leaned in and he kissed her. Kara, not thinking straight, stepped toward him. She stepped on his foot. \"AAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW!\" Lenny screamed in pain. \"My foot! It's broken.\" Kara checked on him. \"Oh Lenny, I'm so sorry!\" Meanwhile, Roman checked his phone. \"Oh no!\" he said. \"I've got to see Kara right away.\" Of course when he arrived, he was informed she had taken Lenny to the Emergency Room. Roman told Fred that Garrison Denton was once again partnered up with Vandal Savage. And they had collected another casino. Once Roman arrived at the ER he told Kara the news. Roman checked up on Lenny. \"Hi Lenny,\" he said. He was surprised to see Roman. \"Oh, hey.\" \"Listen Lenny, I want to put things behind us,\" he said. Lenny looked over at Kara. He saw that look in her face, in her eyes. He saw how much it would mean to her. So Lenny agreed. They shook hands. Lenny felt bad for himself. Not because of his foot. The doctor said even though it was crushed, eventually it would be fine. Of course he couldn't say that Kara did it. Not that he'd believe it anyway. Still, it would be a while before he'd be using both his feet again. \"Lenny, I am so sorry,\" Kara said. She meant a number of things by that. \"You've apologized enough times. We're good.\" She smiled. Roman gave him books and magazines to read. \"Hmmmm… The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas,\" Lenny said. \"Always meant to read this.\" \"You'll love it,\" Roman said. \"I'll be alright, go get Savage and Denton,\" said Lenny. They were off. \"I am so glad you've convinced me to our renewed partnership,\" Denton said. In the background was a packed house at the casino that was just gained by them. Vandal Savage and his genie just grinned. \"It wasn't exactly without kicking and screaming,\" Savage reminded him. \"Master is correct,\" added the Genie. \"Why look at the past?\" asked Denton. Footsteps are heard. \"Because that'll explain how you'll be spending your future,\" Fred said. \"Well copper, how'd you get to Nevada so quickly?\" asked Denton. This brought a flashback to Fred's first meeting with The Bat Man. Or, just Batman as he got to know him. To think he was about to arrest him. Fred got to see Batman in action against petty criminals and saw he was on the side of good. Batman had earned Fred's respect. And in the process, brought Fred to Nevada. \"You're all under arrest!\" Fred stated. \"Arrested? For what?\" asked Vandal. \"Let's start with your shady business deals, tough guy!\" responded Fred. \"What shady business deals?\" asked Denton. \"Ponzi schemes!\" shouted Fred. The Genie looked confused. \"What kind of scheme?\" he asked. The sirens were heard in the background. \"Good! Back up arriving,\" Fred told them. \"I wish the officer of the law had a toy gun instead,\" Vandal wished. \"Shut up!\" shouted Fred. The Genie granted the wish. Fred noticed the change with his gun. \"What the?\" \"I wish I was a thousand miles away from here,\" said Vandal. \"No wait, take me with you!\" begged Denton. Fred saw Savage and his pal, the Genie, disappear. Fred threw a right hook on Denton's chin. Denton fell down. \"You're not going anywhere!\" said Fred. \"What kind of evidence have you got?\" asked a groggy Denton. Fred smiled. \"Wouldn't you like to know?\" Fred lifted Denton up. Denton saw that Fred had turned his attention towards the door. Denton quickly went to his pocket and pulled out a gun. \"Mine's real, yours isn't,\" Denton said. He pointed it right at Fred. \"Your time is up, Denton,\" Fred told him. Denton panicked. \"I won't be stopped! Not like this!\" BANG! BANG! Fred fell down. Denton made a run for it. While Denton escaped, he thought of a way to steal the Genie away from Vandal Savage. The police charged in and found Fred down. \"Officer down!\" At this point, Kara and Roman targeted Vandal Savage and the Genie. She dodged several surprises that Vandal wished for. Suddenly, Kara used her super-breath to freeze him. The Genie did nothing. \"Remember, I can't do anything unless master makes a wish.\" Roman placed an anonymous call to the police. Her super-hearing picked up a distress call. Tears rolled from her eyes, down her face. \"Kara, what's wrong?\" asked Roman. \"Dad?\" she said. She used her super-speed and arrived at the scene. Fred was unconscious on a stretcher. \"Daddy!\" screamed Kara. Vandal Savage was taken into custody. Fred is in a coma. Kara and Roman went to see Vandal to confront him. \"Who shot my father?\" demanded Kara. \"Answer her!\" commanded Roman. \"Listen, I know your secret, young lady,\" Savage responded. \"I could've spilled the beans at any time.\" \"And what's your point?\" asked Kara. \"I would've surely held your parents captive verses attempted murder,\" he spoke. \"That way you'd be forced to obey me!\" \"So who's done this to him?\" she demanded. \"I have an idea,\" responded Vandal. \"THEN WHO?\" \"Why should I tell you?\" \"You idiot, you're being accused.\" \"And with what proof?\" \"It's him, gotta be!\" said Roman. \"No, it isn't,\" she said. \"You heard my heart beat didn't you?\" \"Denton!\" Kara went back home to see her mom. Vandal went through a long interrogation process and was fatigued. Denton came to see him with papers to sign. \"My entire fleet of lawyers will be at your disposal, partner.\" Vandal signed them. Denton smiled. \"I'll help you, my friend,\" he said. Kara woke up and was still heart-broken about her father, Fred, being knocked into a coma. Both her and Sylvia visited him at the hospital. The Genie went to see Vandal. \"Okay, I've had enough, time to zap me out of this mess,\" said Vandal. \"I can't,\" he responded. \"And why not?\" \"You're not my master anymore.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You signed me away.\" \"I did no such thing.\" Garrison Denton stepped into scene. \"Afraid you did, friend.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You signed over your remaining wishes to me.\" \"WHAT?\" Denton heckled Savage. \"You will not get away with this.\" Denton whispered to the Genie. \"Time for a wish!\" \"NO!\" \"You're going far, far away!\" And Vandal Savage was gone. \"Good riddance,\" Denton said. Play time is over. I am a powerful man. People will continue to fear and respect me. No super-powered person will stand in my way. Today Leesburg, tomorrow? Who knows? I am Garrison Denton! Later on Lucas shared his theory with the Blur (Kara) that Denton didn't escape. \"Genie, tell me about Krypton.\" \"Since I don't know myself I can only zap you up information.\" A computer disk appeared. \"Excellent!\" grinned Denton. Garrison Denton quickly went to his computer. KRYPTON Planet Current status: Extinct. Destroyed.[Chapter 2] Supergirl Season Four Eightieth Episode Garrison Denton learns about Krypton Behind the Computer \"Remarkable!\" Denton said. Garrison Denton was learning about the El's. \"Jor-El, heh?\" At the hospital, Lenny met an executive from \"Deal or No Deal.\" It would be a special Super Deal or No Deal. Lenny agreed to be a contestant. The briefcases would look like this: 1 cent 5 cents 10 cents 15 cents 25 cents 50 cents 75 cents $1 $5 $10 $15 $20 $25 $30 $35 $40 $45 $50 $60 $75 $90 $100 $150 $175 $200 $250 $300 $305 $310 $325 $350 $400 $405 $415 $430 $445 $500 $556 Lenny smiled. $618 $672 $698 $700 Lenny agreed to appear. $800 $900 $915 $1,000 $1,015 $1,025 $1,050 $1,075 $2,000 $2,025 $3,000 $3,050 Lenny saw this as a way to win Kara. $3,075 $4,000 $4,080 $5,000 $5,005 $6,000 $7,000 $8,000 $9,000 $9,050 $9,090 $10,000 $10,250 $10,550 $10,900 $11,000 $12,000 $13,000 $14,000 $15,000 $16,000 $17,000 $18,000 $19,000 $20,000 $20,025 Lenny: Kara will be mine.

Kara was still investigating Denton, wanting to prove he was the one responsible for what happened to Fred. Still, Lenny texted her about his news. She was thrilled for Lenny. Both Kara and Roman want to be there for support for there friend. At least Roman was hoping they could be friends. \"Who's going to host this?\" asked Roman. \"Will it be Howie Mandell?\" \"Nope, they tried to get him, but he signed to be in a new movie.\" Lenny responded. \"Which one?\" Roman asked. \"Vigilante.\" \"Oh, about the old hero?\" \"Correct!\" \"Who's directing it?\" \"The man who directed Friday the 13th in 1980, Sean S. Cunningham.\" \"Is this based on Greg Saunders?\" \"Yup! The original.\" Professional wresting legend, \"The Nature Boy\" Ric Flair will be hosting the Ultimate Deal or No Deal special. No, Howie Mandell will not be playing Vigilante. As a way to hang out with Kara, they got together to make a best of Ric Flair DVD. As they searched through the tapes, Lenny cooked her a nice dinner. Matches put on the DVD. 1.) National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Championship match: \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes vs. \"The Nature Boy\" Ric Flair from September 17, 1981, at Kansas City, MO. 2.) February 9, 1982 in Miami: Ric Flair vs. The Midnight Rider. Rider wins the title, but is ordered by Brad Geigle to either unmask or return the belt. Midnight Rider ( Dusty Rhodes ) returned the title. Lenny attempted to hold hands with Kara. \"Lenny!\" \"I can't help it. I care so much about you.\" The Ric Flair verses Jack Veneno match was then put on. Flair's first three World Titles. \"I really do hope your dad will be okay,\" said Lenny. \"I know you do,\" Kara responded. \"Hopefully Denton will pay!\" \"Oh, he will! I'll make sure of it.\" \"I wish I could borrow your x-ray vision for the game.\" \"Well, you don't.\" \"Perhaps you can take a look into the cases for me and we can have a system.\" \"You want me to use my powers to help you cheat?\" \"We can split the money.\" \"Lenny! I can't believe you'd ask me to cheat!\" \"I can't do that.\" \"Sorry.\" They then recorded Flair's matches with Carlos Colon, Victor Jovica, and Harley Race. Flair's first six World titles. They then put on another Harley Race match, and Kerry Von Erich, Dusty Rhodes, Ronnie Garvin, Ricky Steamboat, Sting, and Tastumi Fuginami. Flair's first thirteen World titles. Lenny fell asleep on the couch as they watched Flair win his fourteenth World Championship in the Royal Rumble. Kara looked at him and couldn't help but feel bad. She knew he still had feelings for and wanted to be with her. She covered him with a blanket. Roman then came over and watched as Flair won World title number fifth-teen from Randy Savage with her. \"Wow, this disk holds a lot of memory,\" Roman said. Kara smiled. Lenny woke up after Flair had defeated Barry Windham for his sixteenth World Championship. As they watched Flair take on Vader for World title seventeen, Lenny said bye to Kara and Roman and went home. Kara and Roman cuddled up together and watched as Flair wrestled Steamboat for the eighteenth World Championship. They kissed. Flair verses Sting for the nineteenth World title. Kara and Roman were heating up together. \"I love you, my powerful girlfriend!\" They were making out. They were getting into it. Flair wrestling Savage for twentieth World belt. \"OUCH!\" \"Oh, sorry, sorry…\" The girl forgot her own strength. Flair-Savage (Twenty-first World Title.) Roman was okay. And he forgives her. They just cuddled on the couch together as Flair took on Hulk Hogan for the twenty-second World Title. They closed their eyes. Sounds of Flair-Jeff Jarrett for World Title twentythree were playing in the background. They're young and in love. Kevin Nash presented Flair with his twentythird World Championship. Now Lenny gets his ultimate opportunity. Lenny is asked to choose a briefcase. He thought of Kara so he chose the case marked K. Flair asked Lenny to choose a case to continue. \"I pick A.\" \"$300.\" \"Pick another one.\" \"0.\" \"$415.\" \"Another one.\" \"S.\" \"$700.\" \"One more.\" \"B.\" \"$1,050.\" The Banker calls and offers Lenny $500 to walk away. \"No deal!\" \"WOOOOOO! Let's continue.\" \"M.\" \"$13,000.\" \"N.\" \"$75,000.\" \"Aw, man!\" \"Try again, brother!\" \"I.\" \"$40 million.\" \"What TA!\" \"Keep it going, man.\" \"C.\" \"$500 million.\" The Banker called again. This time he offered $550 and an autographed Ric Flair NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt. \"No deal!\" \"Let's continue.\" \"K.\" \"$5.\" \"E.\" \"$75.\" \"D.\" \"$800.\" \"F.\" \"$1,025.\" Now the banker called again and this time offered a pay-off of $560, the autographed Ric Flair NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, and an autographed Ric Flair WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt. \"No deal!\" \"Lenny, the Banker wants to know if you're nervous,\" asks Flair. \"No, I'm not,\" responds Lenny. \"OK, let's continue,\" Flair says. \"G!\" \"$5,005!\" \"S.\" \"$15,000.\" \"U!\" \"$350 million.\" \"Oh. Come on!\" \"Next case.\" \"P.\" \"10 cents.\" The Banker calls. The offer this time was $580, the autographed Ric Flair NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, the autographed Ric Flair WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt, and an autographed Ric Flair WWF World Heavyweight Championship belts. \"NO DEAL!\" Then the Banker decided to make a bet with Lenny, separate from the game. If his blood pressure and pulse can remain normal as he's choosing the next set of cases, Lenny will win all three autographed championship belts, along with an autographed Flair wrestling boots and robe. Lenny agrees. \"R!\" \"75 cents.\" \"L.\" \"$30.\" \"O.\" \"$310.\" \"D.\" \"$556.\" Since Lenny's blood pressure and pulse were up to par, he won the Flair prizes. Also the Banker made Lenny an offer of $600 to quit. \"NO DEAL!\" \"OK, next case,\" Flair said. \"J!\" \"$5,000!\" \"H!\" \"19,000!\" \"X.\" \"30,080.\" \"Oh no!\" \"It's not over yet.\" \"Z.\" \"$100,000.\" \"Ugh!\" The Banker calls and offers Lenny $690. \"NO DEAL!\" \"Okay then, let's continue,\" Flair said. \"Q.\" \"6 Million.\" Lenny felt sick. \"Y.\" \"$75 million.\" Lenny was nervous. \"T.\" \"$25.\" \"V.\" \"$90.\" The Banker called and offered him $700 to back out. \"No deal, man!\" \"WOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Flair said. \"W.\" \"$400.\" \"1.\" \"$915.\" \"5.\" \"$16,000.\" \"2.\" \"1 million.\" Lenny felt bad. And so the Banker called again. The offer was $800 to leave. Garrison Denton flicked through the channels. \"Oh yes, young Leonard trying to win big.\" \"4.\" \"One cent.\" \"3.\" \"$100.\" \"6.\" $200.\" \"10.\" \"$1,075.\" The Banker calls. The offer this time was $875 to quit. Lenny refused, again. \"9.\" \"$55,000.\" \"7.\" \"$2 million.\" \"8.\" \"$60 million.\" \"11.\" \"$900 million.\" Lenny was angry. The Banker called again. He offered him $880 to walk away. Lenny didn't do it. And so it continued as Kara and Roman looked on… $10 $50 $618 $10,000 $50,000 $2 million. $90 million. $418 million. All those amounts. They were all knocked out. First a $900 pay off was offered and turned down. Then one for $929 was offered and again turned down. Lenny was shaking by this point. Would Kara even go with him when this is over? How will his life even be like? The next case he chose contained $20. But the other one was for $305. Then it was $1,015. And then $21,000. Lenny really wishes he could see through those cases.[Chapter 3] Lenny continued on in the Deal or No Deal game, hosted by Ric Flair. $900, $4,080, $12,000, and $25,000 had all been taken out. The Banker called. Flair said he was offered $900 to walk away. \"NO DEAL!\" Lenny was nervous, but determined. $350 is eliminated. Then $698. \"Oh Kara, it's you!\" Lenny drifted. $3,075 was next to go. \"It's always been you.\" Now it was $10,250. And the Banker phoned. The Banker made a $950 offer along with an autographed helmet of World War I hero, Lt. Anthony Trevor. He imagined himself with Kara in Gracland together. \"No Deal!\" $325, $672, $9,090, and $20,000 have been taken away. Now it was time to hear from the Banker again. The offer this time was $1,000 and an autographed helmet of World War II hero, Bentley Trevor. Lenny said, \"no deal.\" So the game continued. $56,000, $1 million, $9 million, and $4 million were wiped out. The Banker offered Lenny $3,050 and elsewhere, Vandal Savage and the Genie, and Garrison Denton were causing a ruckus. Yes, Vandal found his way back. Garrison Denton was wondering if there was any way he could get rid of him. It was still season 4. Episode 80. Vandal Savage returned at 1,388 years old. The Genie was elsewhere in the casino and Savage's henchmen dragged Gar in. Vandal threw a piece of paper at Denton. \"Sign it, or he dies!\" Savage demanded. He hesitated. A bullet was fired which missed him by an inch. Garrison quickly signed. So now Denton had control of the Genie again. A Genie that was just attacked by Batman in the very casino he was destroying. But Kara, as the Blur, arrived to help. The Martian Manhunter showed up. \"You've caused enough trouble,\" he said to the Genie. Manhunter zapped him into a black hole, much to the horror of Savage. Roman, wearing a disguise of his own, hit Denton in the back with a karate kick. Denton went crashing down. Vandal Savage was now fighting Batman. Vandal found himself on the losing end. Kara captured the henchmen. After the crisis was over, Garrison Denton was arrested. Kara and Roman spoke to the Batman. They could see that Batman is a good man, one of the good guys. \"What's next for you, Batman?\" asked Kara, as the Blur. \"I'll be returning to my hometown of Gotham City and clean up over there,\" he responded. \"And I'll do my best in Leesburg.\" \"I know you will.\" Later on, Fred was glad to hear Denton had finally been put behind bars. Lenny was still testing his luck. The latest cases he chose contained $700 million, $600 million, and $480 million. The Banker offered him $1000. \"NO DEAL!\" The audience cheered. Ric Flair clapped. \"WOOOOOOOOOOO!\" $15, $80,000, $18,000, and $20,025 were knocked out next. At this point a man in an expensive suit walked in to visit Denton. \"What kept you?\" Denton asked. The man grinned. \"Glad to see you too,\" he said.[Chapter 4] My idea for a live action Justice League movie. (One is slated to come out in 2015.) I have an idea for a live action Justice League movie. The Batman movies have been extremely successful. The Christopher Nolan Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises are classics already. Now there's a new live action Superman movie, \"Man of Steel.\" Now there's a Justice League movie planned out for a 2015 release. Recently there was an Avengers movie. A huge advantage that DC has is while Spider-Man wasn't allowed to be in their movie, Superman is allowed to be in the upcoming JL movie. We see how the formula for The Avengers worked. In Iron Man (2008) Nick Fury made a cameo appearance to hype up the eventual film. Then in The Incredible Hulk (2008) Tony Stark shows up. Of course, the formula continued with Thor, Iron Man 2, and Captain America. The Avengers (2012) was huge due to that momentum and build-up. Smallville was a very successful television series. Ten seasons and now the story continues in the comic book title, \"Smallville Season Eleven.\" Imagine how well a movie version based on Smallville, and following the Season 11 comic book, would do in the movie theaters. Fans will already know the characters and back stories from the TV show. Batman is already introduced into the Smallville universe thanks to the comics. Wonder Woman would fit right in. Smallville fans everywhere would go to the theaters to see a spin-off of their favorite show. Plus it wouldn't affect the new Superman \"Man of Steel\" movie. It's a win-win situation for everybody! Plus, it's something fresh, new, and different. My Cast Idea Superman: Tom Welling Green Arrow: Justin Hartley The Flash: Kyle Gallner Aquaman: Alan Ritchson Cyborg: Lee Thompson Young Black Canary: Alaina Huffman Zatana: Serinda Swan Martian Manhunter: Phil Morris Supergirl: Laura Vandervoort Batman: Eric Winter Batgirl: Hillary Tuck Wonder Woman: Summer Glau Lex Luthor: Michael Rosenbaum The Joker: Barry Watson Maxima: Charlotte Sullivan Jeremy Creek: Adrian McMorran Eric Summers: Shawn Ashmore Metallo: Brian Austin Green Zod: Callum Blue Harley Quinn: Alexis Thorpe Doomsday: CGI Toyman: Chris Gauthier Sean Kelvin: Michael Coristine Chloe Sullivan-Queen: Allison Mack Lois Lane: Erica Durance Lana Lang: Kristin Kreuk Pete Ross: Sam Jones III Perry White: Michael McKean Production Team Idea Mark Gough Miles Millar Kelly Souders Tim McCanlies David Nutter James Frawley Michael Katleman Philip Levens Lawerence Konner Dan Harris Randall Zisk Dan Riba Alan Burnett Zack Snyder David S.

Labs Paradise Island Filming in: New York City New Jersey Hollywood, CA LA Orlando, FL Atlanta, GA Kansas Michigan Montana Providence, RI East Providence, RI Rumford, RI River Side, RI Barrington, RI Tom Welling, of course, is the obvious and important choice to have return to the role and star in the film. Fans would also love to see Justin Hartley return to his role of Oliver. Kyle Gallner was of course an early version of The Flash on the show, as Bart and Impulse. He's been getting a lot of acting jobs and becoming recognizable. It would be a good idea for him to return to this role. Alan Ritchson is the Aquaman/Arthur Curry that Smallville fans remember and should return. Same reason for Lee Thompson Young to play Cyborg in the movie as well. Tom Welling, of course, is the obvious and important choice to have return to the role and star in the film. Fans would also love to see Justin Hartley return to his role of Oliver.

Same reason for Lee Thompson Young to play Cyborg in the movie as well. Alaina Huffman was brilliant as Black Canary on the show. She'll be excellent in a big-screen version. It would only be right to have Serinda Swan come back as Zatana as well. Phil Morris would also be a true credit to the film. Laura Vandervoort on the movie screen as Supergirl? What more is there to say? Now the difficulty is choosing a new live action Batman. Who do you get to play him? No one can fill the huge shoes left by Christian Bale. Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises; that franchise is a masterpiece. If Smallville was able to get a young Bruce Wayne on the program, who would've been chosen to play him? In this case, I think Eric Winter would fit in nicely. Continue the Adventure! Elsewhere... DNA. All living cells contain the nucleic acid called DNA. It's the material of heredity. DNA is the material of a nucleic acid. DNA is a double helix made up of two strands of nuclotides. (The DNA samples collected from Clark, Lex, and Kara in an earlier episode are now being tampered with.) Nucleotides are composed of the five carbon sugar deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and a base. (The lab looks mysterious.) There are four bases. Guanine, cytosine, thymine, and adenine. The two strands of nucleotides are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of the two strands. The base pairing is always guanine to cytosine and adenine to thymine. The double helix is the chromosome and contains genes. \"This has to work.\" Now they needed a virtual mitosis to take place. Mitosis is ordinary cell division whereby one cell becomes two identical daughter cells. The daughter cells contain the same number of chromosomes as the diploid or 2N condition. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle and is made up of four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. \"It'll work.\" And so it begins. Prophase: Chromosomes have duplicated and are joined at the centromere. Chromosomes condense. Microtubules form from centrioles. Nuclear membrane is lost. Now they waited for metaphase. Metaphase: Duplicated chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell facing the poles or centrioles one duplicated member of the pair over the other. The three DNA's are combined. Anaphase: It begins when the duplicated centromeres of each pair of sister chromatids separate, and the now-daughter chromosomes begin moving toward opposite poles of the cell due to the action of the spindle. As this occurs, Lenny still nervously awaits while another case opens up on Deal or no Deal. Ooooo, an $8 million case got knocked out. The Banker makes an offer. $8,000. Lenny turns it down. At this point, Kara as Linda Lee Danvers, shows up in attendance. Just as a $50 million case was eliminated. Lenny just couldn't help but fantasize about her. Yes, he was completely over Leslie now. A $7,000 case, gone, but hey, it was a low amount, right? Ric Flair kept trying to act like his 1983 self. . Thankfully, the case with the quarter also was removed. Lenny even looked over at her in the audience. OOOoooo…. There goes the $95 million case. After the Banker made another offer, which he turned down, Flair noticed Lenny smiling at Kara. Flair asked Lenny if she's his girlfriend. Lenny hesitated, not knowing how to respond. Suddenly, Roman showed up. By her side. \"Well, that settles that,\" Flair said. And just how is Leslie Willis doing? Working for the Denton radio station, she's making an even bigger name for herself. She worked on the air so naturally. She even plugged Lenny's appearance on Deal or No Deal. But, nearby her, in that secret lab, the secret experiment was still in play. A clone. They were creating a clone. It's illegal and immoral. But they clearly don't care. What a ratings story this would be for Leslie. If only she knew. But she doesn't. Meanwhile at the Wayne Mansion, as Bruce Wayne adds upgrades to the Bat Cave, Alfred Pennyworth had the game show playing in the background. A $100 million case was just eliminated. A campaign commercial aired for Harvey Dent. The Banker made Lenny an offer of $80,000. Lenny said, \"NO DEAL!\" Down in the Bat Cave Bruce remembered his date with Vicky Vale. Lenny had a million thoughts racing through his head. By winning all this money, he can have it all. Including the super-powered blonde his heart desires. An offer of $85,500 was made. Man, she was looking fabulous to him. \"NO DEAL!\" screamed Lenny. Lenny knew he'd have to eliminate the case with the nickel inside. Back in Gotham City, the buzz of Harvey Dent running for district attorney was still all the chatter. Lenny chose another case. \"Come on, nickel, nickel, nickel, nickel….\" Ric Flair was flirting with the remaining models. It turned out to be the $200 million case. \"Wow! The Banker made a huge deal. $96,000!\" Ric Flair stated. \"Take the deal, Lenny!\" Roman shouted. Lenny looked at Kara and had an idea. \"NO DEAL!\" Flair was shocked. Lenny was twice as shocked. Kara had a bad feeling. \"I didn't see that one coming,\" Flair said. Lenny looked confident. \"I'd like to call my friend up here and ask her for advice on this next decision,\" he said. Kara walked over to the stage. \"Lenny, what's going on?\" she asked. Lenny whispered in her ear. \"I need to know which case,\" he said softly. \"Don't put me in this situation,\" she said, \"I can't use my powers for selfishness and personal gain…. I won't.\" \"Please, Kara, I'm desperate.\" \"I'm sorry, Lenny.\" \"I'll never ask you again.\" \"This goes against all I believe.\" \"I know.\" Flair was getting impatient. \"Do you want to keep your original case or swap them?\" asked Flair. Lenny looked at Kara for an answer. His eyes were sad. Desperate even. Kara shook her head. She was sorry, but refused to be pushed around or coaxed. She stood her ground. Lenny looked furious. Not like those cases were made of lead. She could see through them just fine. \"Is she usually a lucky charm for you?\" Flair asked. Lenny looked irked. \"Yeah, usually!\" Kara put her head down and suddenly her super-hearing picked up on something. She alerted Roman. They both headed out. Lenny was completely let-down by this. \"Lenny, I'm going to need a response here,\" Flair demanded. \"Well, I suppose I'm keeping my case,\" he said.

It was one of the universe's youngest and greatest suns. The gigantic blue sun shared its overwhelming might without greed, but exaggerated generosity. Touching everything within her vast domains with unimaginable power. Sucking and vaporizing everything bold enough to significantly approach its neon blue-white beauty. Only one of its entrusted worlds was blessed with life. Only one could resist its beautiful power and might, the distant child, the last planet of the system, the beautiful T'areba. S'kriva'h was not just a sun, but also the prime inspiration for T'areba's greatest poets. Often described as 'The World's Supreme Treasure' and 'The Jewel of T'areba's Proud'. She was fifty-five thousand times as powerful as the Earth's sun. A true nuclear gemstone of God, blessed with greatness and strength; a power destined to give itself for the miracle of life; Life for the great planet, at the edge of its domains. T'areba was a true green paradise, a rain forest like garden, whose name 'Green Paradise' justified its beauty and vast life forms and this was the home world of the keen insectoid race, which tamed and protected it. T'areba was a heavenly planet, covered with thick tropical rain forests and vast green crop fields. Small and deep oceans full of life, and endless lakes and rivers cutting through virgin emerald jungles; with huge and low jungle covered mounts and millennial craters. Farming compounds and huge cities were everywhere, but carefully placed and planed to protect and maximize the living potential of the generous ecosystem. Its gifted children were a large and peaceful civilization now united for over four centuries under a single ruling queen council. Now united for development, for seeding their legacy beyond the borders of their beloved S'kriva'h. The first steps were slowly being laid, but a century or two would still be necessary to develop the tools and means to reach the stars the way they dreamed it; the vision they embraced when the first of their kind orbited T'areba on a crude and sturdy space capsule eight decades ago. The low orange clouds dissolved and separated with the growing warmth and delightful light of the blue giant that rose slowly in the distant horizon. L'iusak lifted his insectoid head towards the delicately pinked nimbus swimming above, into the dawning orange sky, and straightening up is 6,6 ft tall biped form at the top of his singing retractile tower. His elegant head looked like a bald-faced hornet's head, but with marked differences. T'areban mandibles were much smaller and elegant, the antennas were smother and extended forward from the back of the head, their eyes were slightly smaller, whit a golden or silver ring around them. The exoskeleton was more stylized, smoother, edgeless and protuberant, more fitted for intelligent living than raw survival. His 2 legs had 3 segments that stood normally in a tilted Z composition. He lifted his two thick long arms and spread his 3 fingers and the bulky opposable thumb. L'iusak's exoskeleton was metalized green with electric purple joints. He was wearing a translucent flexible working exo over his natural armor, his farmer working clothes. The alien garment had intricate light purple designs that explained his line, the community he belonged to and his rank. L'iusak extended his elegant musical spikes at his metallic green back all the way up with religious patience. Slowly and steadily he began to welcome the new morning with the sunrise chant. His intense and high hissing, similar to an earth's cicada, spread like the blue sunlight that was flooding the endless green fields around his huge farming compound, his home, and many others around on the great fields of K'len; also called 'The Granary of T'areba'. Almost instantly, another chant merged with his own, coming from another farmer far away, and then another, and soon many others. The T'areman's chant flooded the vast crop fields creating a passionate and vast chorus. The brilliant sunrise blasted the sparsely clouded horizon in an explosion of color, inviting every life form to admire the indescribable view. S'kriva'h emerged completely at the horizon, reflecting his majestic light in the perfectly polished dark blue walls of the countless alien caterpillar shaped compounds; every one sitting at the center of 4 circular crop fields. The gigantic city in the great lake far away, with its tremendous egg shaped mile high citadels shimmered under the sunlight. Each egg shaped citadel housed an independent city with living facilities, food and hardware distribution centers, medical centers, laboratories, factories and research facilities. Each gigantic building rested on a crafted pedestal that once was a natural island, towering high over the lake's surface, 1000 feet below. Each skyscraper was surrounded at its base by a ring of thick virgin jungle; a living ornament to honor T'arebas's beauty and remember their origins. The chant finished and each singer went back inside their own compounds to prepare for the grand harvest. The weather prophets had announced a glorious day ahead and a rich harvest for the last weeks before winter. L'iusak watched his entrusted crop fields around his compound with growing enthusiasm; he was already geared up and could barely hold his excitement. The long nights sacrificed to perfect the seeding mechanisms, crop feeding and stimulation, and the updated pest control robots had paid of very well; he had by far one of the richest fields of K'len, and at the end of the harvest cycle his family will surely win the summer harvesting prize. He was only waiting for the great moment to begin. His dark purple eyes glinted, his metallic green exoskeleton was even decorated with expressly ornamented farmer jewels his wife had especially prepared for him, for today as an early testimony of the imminent family triumph. L'iusak programmed his harvesting towers, singing the distinctive command in his musical arm wrist computer. A pleasant melody sang back, acknowledging his orders, and the huge compound beneath him began to tremble like the epicenter of a very soft tremor. Four large circular sluices located at the four cardinal points of the complex opened. Slowly, 4 mighty 120 feet high automatic squid shaped alien harvesters rose above the ground and reached their cruise altitude of 100 feet. L'iusak sang the next command; the giant harvesting machines extended their sensor tentacles and optic probes at the base, and advanced forward in a perfectly coordinated pattern. Each machine drifted perpendicular to the other and lowered their altitude to harvest level. The moment had come. The bug hunter robots flew away from the four circular crop fields surrounding L'iusak's compound, back inside their artificial hives to recharge their batteries. One final command and the farming towers slowly began extracting the precious grain in a circular pattern with the help of multiple blue cutting beams from the tentacles and appropriated suction power; closing the circle with each new sweep, like a whirlpool. L'iusak sang satisfied and his antennas shivered with excitement. He barely noticed the beauty of the sunrise as he stared at the perfectly coordinated work of his entrusted farm equipment. The harvesters were doing a great job! Even the repaired one that was malfunctioning the last time and wasted several tons of food before he could deactivate it; now it was back from the food machines production lab and supposedly fully repaired. He wished his city's Master Farmer would have sent him a new one and recycle this one, but the hot headed master decided the huge machine still had some productive lifespan ahead so he had to swallow it. So far, he was right. L'emuk, his neighbor, was staring at L'iusak's progress with his wife at his side, whose female exoskeleton exhibited a wonderful combination of metallic orange and gloss onyx tones, displaying elegantly the creator's choice for their race: males had exos with more cold colors, while females more attractive warm colors. The couple sang deliciously, congratulating their neighbor and sharing their happiness. If only happiness could last forever. L'iusak lifted his insectoid head and glanced up, to the far domains of space, as if a guardian spirit would have moved his head. The spontaneous detonation above and beyond the edge of the atmosphere caught his eyes, and shaped a massive liquid fire bubble. Its form and texture was very unusual and the mesmerizing colors dancing on its surface fascinated every living being on T'areba, catching every eye, amazing every mind, scaring every heart. L'iusak watched the rare phenomena and touched a symbol in his forearm computer, it glowed instantly. His singing tower descended to the ground level of the observation platform in the roof of his farm compound. His wife was waiting for him at the roof observation platform, gazing at the rare phenomenon as well; intrigue and worry dominated her soft features. L'iusak was concerned too. There were no space test programmed for that day in that particular hemisphere, and the shape and glows of the phenomena was nothing he had ever seen before, nor dream about. But he was almost sure of one thing, it could not be natural. \"Go inside, my beloved one, I will follow you soon.\" L'iusak's wife bowed her majestic reddish pink head in a silent nod and quickly went inside. L'iusak secured the complex doors and windows remotely using his forearm computer, and sang the familiar atmospheric sentinel's code. He also signaled the other farmers around to join his conversation in the process. If someone knew something about this, he wanted to hear him. Every farmer and T'areban in the area joined the conversation, much to his surprise with the same doubts and fears. \"Wetter Master V'ereta, we saw a strange denotation, apparently nuclear, near the atmosphere. Did you notice it?\" At the near city, inside the biggest egg shaped building in the center of the lake, a group of climate researchers at the farming weather control stared in muted amazement to the big images displayed in the elliptical monitors at the walls and working nests, with more curiosity than concern. V'ereta, the group leader, watched the phenomena in his individual monitor at his working station. He was sitting at the top of the central multi nest platform where he was commanding his research team. Each member had a nest station below him and the other composite nests around the platform were almond shaped surveillance stations accommodating private weather researchers. The eyes of everyone were on the screens, but their questions were on him, their team leader; the one 'always' in control of the situation. If only he had the answers his personnel thought he had. \"We are processing the circumstantial data girth now, and it is too soon to distill an answer. Please remain calm and transmit any useful information\". Suddenly, the largest screen displayed the most strange and eye catching image everyone at the center had ever seen: the pulsing cocoon that beat like a space giant's heart exploded like a surprise nuclear strike, and multiplied wildly fast. The young pulsating cocoons dispersed evenly across the planet sphere, forming some sort of perimeter. The cocoon's glow changed dramatically from fire red to a metalized sterling purple. The weather guardians watched astonished as the fascinating data displayed in their elliptical neon green screens showing the pulsating eggs blowing up, releasing what appeared to be some sort of organic mass that also seemed to be artificial at the same time. The masses quickly gained their progenitor's shape and pulsing life. L'iusac saw that the mysterious bright dot disappeared in a flash, like if it was obliterated by a nuclear explosion, living only a suspicious ring shaped green aura were it was before. He was about to enter his complex when two, ten, twenty, hundreds of similar detonations blossomed rapidly in the morning sky filling it with their gloomy radiance. The deformed inter dimensional auras reshaped into massive pulsating cocoons, just like the first one, and began placing themselves around T'areba like small glowing full moons. L'iusac watched, impressed and worried at the same time. The phenomena could not be natural, and whatever intelligence was behind it, definitely wanted to present itself fast and without warning; not the caution ways of a diplomat or emissary, but rather the bold massive force display of an attacker. Questions and fears ran from mouth to mouth in the weather control center. No specialist or researcher seemed to have an answer. The chaos was starting to posses everyone, but the leader was not willing to let that happen, not in his watch. V'ereta shrieked loud, his musical spikes fully extended, until everyone shut up. Then, he took over. \"Listen, L'iusak, thousands of strange objects are orbiting T'areba. I believe they are of an unknown intelligent origin. They seem to reconfigure and reproduce themselves alone. Our optical sensors show us they are changing but we do not now into what. This may be the greatest day of T'areba, the answer to the mother of all questions\" He looked at his staff with proud and determination \"The existence of intelligent alien life! I will contact the atmospheric guard and the Scientific Conclave immediately.\" The high fidelity voice distorted rapidly as the rudimentary holographic image from the leader's watch nest became fuzzy, like attacked by a disease. In the next second all images at the station shut down abruptly. \"Control. Control!\" L'iusak feared the worst and lifted his eyes to the morning sky. He scanned the puzzling dots, up and above, until his fear overcame his curiosity. They were like the vertices of an invisible net, but for what purpose? He was about to send a general warning message to all farmers in the territory, when it began... The cocoons stooped pulsating and dramatically transformed into melon shaped bio hives. The Hivor living fortresses had finally mutated to the appropriated battle form. Monstrous moths formed and lifted over their inter dimensional skin and spat a swarm of creatures that rained down towards the planed like a thick dark cloud. L'iusak watched in muted amazement as what appeared to be streams of distant black smoke surged from the dark dots and dove towards the atmosphere, plainly embracing the destructive consequences of entering T'areba's atmosphere at killing speed. The dark smoke descended fast, its composition and nature defined in a couple of seconds. There were not meteors or debris, but literally a swarm formed by thousands of some kind of strange dark creatures. The creatures slowed down before impact, but the crash was still brutal and powerful. Still, they emerged from their smoking meteor crates fresh and angry. Their main combat armor protruded outside like bulging muscles, ripping through their wasted thermal armor. The disposed armor dissolved in the air like burning silk. One swarm crash landed near L'iusaks field. The emerging creatures changed their armors and rushed from their impact craters instantly, like hungry lions. They attacked the floating giant collectors and complexes around them like killer ants, shredding and destroying everything with pure brute force. There was no technique, no plan or strategy, just pure and plain violence. Ironically, many attackers brought their own doom blowing up inside the exploding giant collectors in the crazy attack, sacrificing themselves frenetically for an unknown cause. The closest collector near L'iusak's complex was brutally invaded by the vicious attackers and lost stability and altitude blazing fast. It exploded violently a few seconds later, spiting a wild rain of sparks and twisted metal chunks hundreds of feet around. L'iusak ducked, face down, and covered his head with his arms. When the hot scrap metal rain was over, L'iusak raised his head and crawled towards the roof hatch. A loud and solid impact echoed behind him. He froze. L'iusak hesitated a second, and turned around; if it was going to be his end, he wanted to see the face of his killer. What he saw nearly terrified him to death, his antennas shivered; the quadruped monster looked like a cross between a reptile, an insect and a wolf. It was mostly black, with a flexible armor that looked like exposed muscle tissue in some segments, had broad shoulders, spiked back, big claws and fangs. The creature's phosphorescent green eyes were fixed on him. It approached him, slowly... Like a horrific predator of some ancient child's terror tale. But this creature was real! Its eye catching shape and ever changing tattoos were unlike anything he had ever seen or imagined before. It was the fundamental warrior of the Raman Cult: the feared and lethal Mutalink. The bizarre trans spatial warrior that was not an insect nor an animal, not a living being nor a machine, not even a ghost... but a sinister combination of all of them. A magnificent conquest weapon, whose only purpose was to destroy and conquer; or die fighting. The Mutalink roared; a high pitched roar, strident to the last note. Like a predator before slaying his prey. L'iusak covered his ears, they ringed in pain. He turned around as fast as he could and ran towards the hatch. The glittering mandibles of the Mutalink opened and the glowing heat of its entrails cooked the air, green resinous energy danced among the fangs. The creature's scream shoot forward, seconding several neon green, spiral shaped liquid energy beams trough the jagged mandibles that converged into one drilling beam. The beam went through L'iusak's body as if it was made of air. The doomed insectoid screamed loudly, his body twisted and convulsed painfully as he vaporized in mid air, in torturous spasms. L'iusak's wife scared more than ever before in her life and hid in a domestic grain storage thank when the attack of the farming complex began. Dozens of Mutakliks rammed the metal amour of the main window and ripped through it easily, like breaking through thin glass. Shards of crystal and metallic alloys rained inside the main living room as the swarm rushed inside, they quickly found the female T'areban whit they advance senses and killed her without hesitation or mercy. Immediately afterwards they began destroying everything on their path; ripping furniture and artworks, incinerating rooms, shredding equipments and walls, without discrimination or control. Explosions thundered all over the complex, some of which blossomed powerfully to the outside, others spat fire like geysers of flames. The earth trembled, and a few more seconds was everything the Mutalinks needed to turn the immense place into a massive fire ball. The Mutalink swarms continued to disseminate trough the entire globe rapidly and deadly: trough lakes, rivers, oceans, islands, continents, plains, mountains and jungles, like rampaging killer ants; running and swimming at surprising speeds while whipping out everything organic and artificial on their path, with a brutal and shocking destruction capability. Twenty minutes after the first strike an unspoken command ran through the horde. Groups of five Mutalinks separated themselves from their respective packs and stooped their rampaging momentum; like black seeps abandoning the heard. They silently communicated and combined themselves, forming one massive pulsating inter dimensional cocoon. Seconds later a whole new Mutalink creature, equally lethal in nature, but with a much more sinister purpose than its predecessors emerged from the exploding cocoon. The new and young air warrior jumped high and embraced the sky at supersonic speed, imitated by dozens of others like him, all around the planet; each Mutalink rising above their respective packs after an identical transformation. They were conceived to dominate the skies of T'areban, forever if necessary, but this time their journey would be short; the ultimate order had been given. The flying Mutalinks reached their designated coordinates and graciously dived downwards in an acrobatic roll, straight towards the surface. Close to ground level, they mutated into a dart shaped AP ballistic bio projectile and sunk deep in the ground and the ocean's bottom. The Mutalinks injected themselves into the planets crust until the adequate deep was reached, then... the sacrifice. Without mercy or hesitation, each burrowed Mutalink detonated in a brutal explosion. Each one whit a force of 200 kilotons; destroying the earth, the oceans, the sky... and even their swarming comrades within their blast radius; but that did not matter, only the obedience, only the goal. That was their mission, their destiny... Hundreds of yellow mushroom shaped nuclear blasts erupted all over T'areba, turning the unforgettable paradise into an indescribable hell of ashes and ruble. The Nature twisted into chaos as tons and tons of burned organic and inorganic matter shot upwards, clouding the entire atmosphere, covering the dying atmosphere whit a storming darkness. Almost all life disappeared in that instant. But even after that horrible taste of Armageddon there was no mercy, no calm after the storm. A new swarm of Mutalinks rained down from space, promptly replacing their vaporized comrades; like flying serpent towards the planet from the orbiting Hivors; ripping through the thick storming dark clouds that started to cover the sky completely. The chaotic weather maddened the planet and stole the warmth and majestic light of the blue giant. Blinding purple bolts danced in the spooky clouds, more than one stroke the ground harshly, further punishing the lethally hurt badland. The new swarm literally covered the devastated surface of the planet again, running and screaming over the burned world, ruling between the storm and the fading sorrow of the dying nature. Destroying the few structures and citadels that miraculously resisted the first devastation, like macabre birds of prey. In spite the quick and devastating global strike, one of the reinforced military citadels was marvelously still standing and active. The garrisoned soldiers and military personnel were battling their own emotional war: struggling to maintain order and discipline were hundreds of unanswered questions and impossible orders ruled. It wasn't too long until they realized their world was being obliterated, without explanation or logic. To make things worse their battle fortress was literally blind, so there was not much they could do to understand what was happening beyond their reinforced walls; but someone listened to their prayers and the fortress's badly pounded sensors made their designers proud one last time. With a last struggle, the damaged systems transmitted data streams and images about what was happening outside and who the attacker was. The Mutalinks had already surrounded the military citadel and were roaring fanatically at it, forming a mighty war chore. The remaining T'areban soldiers managed to activate some of the citadel's main defensive armament, just in time. A few shock cannons screamed and fired magnetically encapsulated mini nuclear detonations to the horde, to the ash covered wasteland below, in a brave last defiance. The Mutalinks never tried to avoid the fire, there simply was no point; the war was won, and this desperate attempt to change the inevitable was more amusing than effective. The Mutalink collective mind rapidly chose the warrior who would deal whit this minor inconvenience. A designated Mutalink emitted a telepathic inter dimensional command and a hundred of his comrades ran towards him. They combined in an eye blink to form a new terrifying creature. A warrior whose armor and destructive power was more than enough to doom the desperate last defenders of T'areba once and for all. The new super Mutalink was three hundred feet tall, whit a firepower equivalent of dozens of Mutalinks. The huge warrior jumped and attacked the building, like a stalking tiger attaching his prey, tearing a hole in the smooth polished outer shield of the army's citadel whit its energized claws. The super Mutalink was as precise and fast as his smaller brothers beneath, firing spiked projectiles that drilled trough the massive alloys and imploded deep inside, causing an exaggerated destruction. While slashing and tearing the great combat creature pushed itself inside; his little brothers dug beneath the fresh ruins to take care of the subterranean section. The beast kept forcing its way inside like a giant monster attacking a building; ripping and tearing everything furiously, punishing the damaged structure until it collapsed whit everything and everyone left inside. A Great pack of Mutalinks stooped in the middle of their run as the swarm of destruction finally reached its last target, purposefully spared. It was a reasonable large city in the southern hemisphere protected by an experimental magnetic force field. The beautiful city was now surrounded by a world of ashes and craters that was one of the most beautiful mountain landscapes of T'areba a few minutes ago. The Mutalinks surrounded the city but did not try to break through the intermittent force field, as if waiting for something to happen... Nine hundred feet away from the city the Mutalinks opened a perfect empty circle in the middle of the swarm. And far above, beyond the hurricane winds and the expanding chaotic dark cloud masses, soared the monster, hidden in the darkness; the most devastating weapon of the Raman Cult. The gigantic creature broke through the clouds like a charging predator and landed violently in his 6 bulky legs like an impacting meteor; right in the center of the great circle; crushing the stone ground and sending a massive shock wave all around. The Broom had arrived. The monster was big. No, it was immense! A solid bio technological inter dimensional warrior conceived to crush and conquer; without weakness, weak points or flaws. The huge creature strengthened his massive 6 legs, showing of his proud 1000 yards stature and bulky bio technological body. It was 50 yards taller than the tallest structure in T'areban. The Broohm... The Broohm targeted his objective and prepared to attack. It rose its body in four of his hind legs, rapidly increasing their mass and density, and mutated magnificently in a poetry of changing forms and colors; now it was ready to attack. The combat ready Broohm opened its mount and a liquid red beam shoot out, cutting through the T'arebans greatest defensive achievement as if it was everything but nothing; like a scalpel cutting mist. The Broohm tilted his massive head backwards, allowing his glowing cutting beam to shoot upwards after until it reached 90°, and let it burn the sky for a few seconds; proving everyone its strength and destructive power. The last hope of the remaining T'arebans was no more. The Broohm roared furiously and jumped forward, to the center of the city. It was an incomparable jump; tons or crushed rocks and ashes ejected upwards whit the power of the mighty impulse, following the giant warrior's short flight and spilling all over him. It landed brutally right in the middle of the city, the earth rumbled and shattered and packs of near Mutalinks flew outwards whit the force of the meteoric impact. The giant warrior roared again and extended his 6 arms, each one aiming at a different citadel building. Energy eels germinated from its clawed fingers and crafted a growing black hole. The black balls, one of the universe's most destructive forces, grew until they reached the size of spheres big enough for the gigantic hands to hold. The Broohm opened his palms and released the dark orbs. Each black hole flew towards its intended targets like intelligent missiles and impacted whit full force; the results could not be more devastating. The black holes literally swallowed and disintegrated each citadel they hit whit unimaginable suction power, and surprisingly collapsed in the moment their job was done. The few bold Mutalinks that were to close to the destructive show were swallowed and disintegrated within the massive gravitational pull, but it was irrelevant; for each fallen Mutallink a hundred more were ready to replace it. Now, the once bristling city full of life, dreams and progress, was nothing more than a sad memory; even less... a silent desolation. All buildings were gone except one, only one. Carefully preserved from the annihilation. The Mutalinks flooded the city's perimeter like a tidal wave and rapidly surrounded the big sparred building. Thousands started to climb its smooth and richly carved metalized ceramic walls, while thousands dug beneath it, separating the massive structure from its base in an epic scene. Raising the massive building several feet of the ground with a titanic effort. The countless Mutalinks above and below created a living pedestal and an intricate net around the structure, restricting it for a double purpose: to stop any unwelcome guest, and stop any inhabitant to leave without permission. When the living restrains were complete, an inter dimensional bubble formed directly in front of the building, a hundred yards apart, and inflated like a balloon. The perfect sphere was smooth and massif, covered whit intricate grows and strange symbols everywhere. There was a tone, and then the sphere split in hundreds of symmetrical fragments from both poles to the equator. The fragments flew away, vanishing into the air, revealing five elegant throne like structures that floated inside; each one different and remarkable in its own way. The throne at the far left wing had an elegant and strange blossomed lotus flower form, beautiful to the last detail of its motives, scintillating colors and symbols; mighty and elegant as the humanoid alien general that sat proudly on it: Sindra. Her body was smooth and her skin was dark blue, covered whit symmetrical dots that ran from the back of her neck to the tips of her 3 toed feet. She wore an ornamented Raman Cult's battle gown. Next to her, Dramyu's throne, a majestic nest similar to a jelly fish, whit tentacles that danced graciously in the air around it, transparent as the almost humanoid shaped alien with glowing purple eyes sitting on it. His vast and luminous circulatory system and few trans spatial organs were clearly visible. At the far right wing Shym's throne was like a black pearl whit a chopped tip, whit little red, blue and yellow suns nested in dozens of niches carved around the throne. He seemed to be made of moving molten lava, and constantly changing his form. Little multi colored suns were orbiting around his throne as well, like electrons around the nucleolus. Next to him, at the left of the great central throne, was Dorvakh; the Raman Cult's Judge, Juror, and Executioner. Dorvakh rested his bizarre smooth body, very similar to the alien sitting on the center. His throne was a sculpted giant alien head, similar to his own; an amazing monument to his race's greatest judge and warrior; the head of Morakh. But no one of the four amazingly beautiful and strange thrones could compare to the biggest one in the center. The great and majestic throne had dominated the colossal view from the very beginning. Sitting on a structure that was a monument to power and defeated foes, was the architect of the planet's destruction: Sarakh the Great. His intriguing humanoid shape was like a mix between an insect, a reptile and a human. He was scaring and marvelously majestic at the same time, whit living tattoos running and reshaping all over his massive body, changing and adapting to his moves and moods. The sharp crest in his majestic head rose upwards proudly; a strange fusion between a crown and a combat helm. His exoskeleton, besides being an intelligent living armor, was also a royal outfit. Sarakh gestured to the general at his right; the transparent alien whit thick ostrich kind of legs cried powerfully and pointed at the wall in front of him whit his index. A luminous dot surged in the center of the finger, in a vein, and split into two dots, from two different colors. The shining dots floated to the outside and spin following the finger's circumference. The dots grew a little and shot forward forming a spiraling, two colored, solid beam. The beam hit the wall surface and formed a ring that dragged the thick heavy alloy wall to an endless deep, like a whirlpool sucking water to its center, and disappeared in a tiny flash. Sarakh's throne advanced first to the inside of T'areba's last standing building as a king whit his war cohort behind him, floating above the loud Mutalink frenzy that covered the earth below and formed the mighty platform that held the building up. The conqueror's throne entered the powerless building silently and slowly. The interior was a mix between a high tech hive and city environment, the colors were mostly soft pink and light purple; the ovoid lights were off and the big elliptical corridors were deserted. There were so many smooth angles and curves... The pale colors and the general \"pacific\" ambient contrasted severally whit the sharp edges, fangs, claws, and the shiny dark colors conforming his throne. Sarakh's generals followed him closely, each in his own throne, in perfect tuning, two at each side; representing the order and power levels of the cult. A faint tremor caressed the building from bottom to top as a swarm of Mutalinks flooded inside like hungry dogs, whit orders of searching and destroying any resistance or threat they find. The living tattoo in Sarakh's forehead changed its shape, and his eyes became living flames. An invisible but terribly destructive wave consumed everything in front of him like a big disintegrating ray; doors, walls, equipment, vaporized like burning gunpowder. The destruction stooped when a heavy armored door vanished before his power. Sarakh advanced towards the now revealed gigantic lab whit his generals behind him, his faced flushed whit delight. The Mutalink swarm advanced inside the lab, searching for something, illuminating the darkened place whit newer luminous armor adaptation; they were definitely Sarakh's proud war dogs and one of his finest creations. The lab complex was huge, whit advance equipment and computers carefully organized and placed all around. The ceiling was as high as a skyscraper, sharing its vast space whit suspended analyzers and heavy equipment carefully stored in the amazing darkened heights. The Mutalinks screams soon blended whit an intense pledging and sobbing in an unknown language. Four of them emerged from the fading darkness deep inside the lab, carrying their victim to their master, whit the care of a nurse. \"Help!\" The T'areban screamed and struggled desperately, only until the terrifying attackers held his members firmly enough to cut his movements, but whit a gentleness that seemed unknown to those destructive mandibles. His hands trembled uncontrollably. \"Please stop...\" He had finally realized there was no escape, perhaps only the moment before the kill. He visualized that with as much certainty as he understood that there was nothing he could do to stop it. The Mutalinks strengthened him up and presented him like a living sculpture to their master; a public spectacle of the T'areban defeat and destruction. The T'areban looked into the glowing purple eyes of the mighty terrifying alien sitting on the spooky throne; he had to be the leader, the boss... And he spoke, whit an intense and amazingly clean voice. \"I heard that you banished fear from your race's existence long time ago, because you conquered it. Was it a Lie? Or just another tale to boast your race's pried and moral?\" The T'areban tilted his head slightly, clearly surprised to hear that strange alien creature speaking in his mother thong. \"Your language is known to me. As well as your identity, K'mar. I am Sarakh The Great. I am the one who destroyed your past, your present, and holds the future of your kind in my hands. Know now that your life has little importance to me, and the only reason you still keep it is because you have information I seek. Open your knowledge to me, so you and a few other T'arebans live.\" K'mar knew this nightmare was real, he knew he had no chance of escaping or changing this cruel fate, so he chose defiance. \"If what you have said is true, alien, then the only way I can harm you is by refusing your request. And I want to refuse very much!\" Sarakh roared and laughed at the same time. With a mighty grin in his face he disappeared from his throne, dived between space and time, and reappeared directly in front of K'len. The T'areban scientist was much smalled than him, and was scared to the death. Delighted whit this display of T'areban's bravery, the warlord approached his elegant and ferocious face to his victims eyes. Sarakh's tail was swinging placidly in the air behind him and stoke suddenly, without warning; like a vicious snake. The mutating prehensile member coiled around K'mar's neck with almost enough force to pop his eyes out, the Mutalinks released him. K'mar wanted to scream, but he couldn't, the grip of Sarakh's tail was almost pulverizing his neck. Sarakh walked outside, carrying him in the air behind him, and stooped at the edge of the hole from where he and his minions entered the enormous building. K'mar was gasping and dying slowly in the alien warrior's powerful tail, almost losing consciousness. Sarakh brought him forward and suspended him outside, showing him the unbearable face of his destroyed home world; a burned and rotten paradise. Billions of Mutalinks screamed and swarmed everywhere, apparently whit no direction or purpose whatsoever; while many others stood still and silent, awaiting new orders; watching their leader in the highs stand proud whit his prey in his tail. The Broohm walked among the city ruins, roaring loud from time to time. The sky was a dark gray chaos; chilly hurricane winds and intermittent bolts danced wildly in the massive dark clouds. The temperature was dropping dramatically fast as the few pillars of sunlight that struggled to dive between the whirlpools and the tick chaotic dark clouds were fading. Still, the scarce light left revealed vividly the magnitude of the destruction below. Minutes before, T'areba was 'The Green Paradise', now it was nothing but desolation, much like the moon's surface. K'mar gasped desperately but Sarakh gave him no pause. \"I have consumed your world...\" Sarakh moved him outside a little bit more, allowing him to fully witness the greatness of his macabre work of art. \"Your dreams, your hope, your beloved ones... and everything you had or would have had in this planet is gone. Still, there is something I haven't take from you, the only thing you have left: your life. So, this game as changed now. It's not about conquest anymore, but pleasure. My pleasure... Sarakh turned him around to face him. \"One way or the other, I will get what I want. I always do. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far I have to go, no matter how much I have to destroy... Now, T'areban, there are two paths for you: refuse to cooperate with me, and I will destroy you with all my rage and anger. Tell me what I want, and by pleasing me you will save your sad life and the lives of the 50 male and female T'arebans in this building I have spared so far. If destiny is generous with your kind, you will be able to survive, reproduce, and perhaps... rebuild some of your lost glory and richness. You have ten seconds to decide, K'mar.\" A tense moment followed those horrible words. K'len weeped in silence; he had lost everything. He could abandon all, even his life; for anger, for revenge... But not hope. For the sake of his kind, not hope... K'mar prayed and made his decision, remembering his queen's words: \"If there is life, there is hope.\" His eyes pledged and Sarakh eased the pressure, just enough to allow him to talk. \"I will tell you everything you want, Sarakh the Great.\" Sarakh tossed him inside. The Mutalinks outside generated a force field around the building to make the environment a more comfortable for the weeping insectoid. K'mar abandoned his pride and crawled forward. He knelled down before his conqueror, his tormentor, between endless tears. \"I know you will...\" Sarakh voice was overloaded with sadism; now he could finally begin to claim his real prize. \"I know you were the leader of a group of technicians who have discovered the impossible. Live within the deeps of the inner space. When did this happen?\" \"Ten cycles ago. I was testing a probe with my team; it was the first stage of a series of experiments aimed to determine the possibility of employing the inner space for long distance voyages. Two cycles after the initial dive, the probe detected an unusual radiation that shouldn't be there according to our data.\" \"Solar radiation...\" \"Yes. But very weak, still, we were most certain it was. So we send a second probe whit specialized instruments to study the radiation and its source.\" \"And then you found them... Correct?\" K'mar looked at the powerful alien in the eyes; his tormentor appeared to know everything already; to be always a step forward. But if they were some secrets he wasn't aware of, they were getting close to them now. \"Yes, we didn't know how to deal whit such an incredible discovery at first, but our curiosity was too great, so we made contact with a group of them. I think with the technicians responsible to survey their own reality. It appeared to be some kind of self sustained colony, but the scarce data they provided us about their culture and layout quickly told us they couldn't have been born in the entrails of the inner space. I believe they are a race of beings that started here, in normal space.\" He gestured his surroundings \"And somehow ended there. But they are extremely reserved and only maintained disciplined restricted contact with us; more for cartography and specific data exchange than anything else.\" Sarakh laughed, delighted. \"They haven't change at all! Even after everything they have been trough... Now, K'mar, I want the coordinates to the specific location where you found them. And... If you feel the temptation to remain silent for the sake of an unknown, very soon doomed race, you can convince your conscience by telling it that your life and the fate of your hope will only cost you the unknown fate of an unknown race.\" K'mar hesitated at first, but the endless song of his world destroyed ecosystem thundering outside was the most convincing argument one could ever hear. \"They are here...\" K'mar told him everything he knew, or though he knew, whit trembling words backed whit fear. Sarakh didn't need to use any kind of torture or mid games on him to verify the accuracy of the information. It was very clear that K'mar was spitting the truth; he knew it partially because of the data he already received in exchange of the life of one of the spared T'arebans, K'mar's personal assistant. Everything matched perfectly. Each general grinned in his/her own way and bowed under Sarakh's gaze. Their mission here was over and victory was once more on their side. Sarakh vanished and reappeared in his throne. He sat back relaxed and ordered. \"We are leaving. And may fate be generous whit this T'arebans, for they obeyed the stronger, and thus obeyed the universe.\" Sarakh's throne drifted outside of the punished building whit his generals, and took them and himself to the deepness of the inner space, to the entrails of the Raman Cult's War Temple.[Chapter 2] The Myth The burning gigantic Ranam symbol drifted freely in the breath taking periphery of the Andromeda galaxy, sharing its mesmerizing liquid flaming colors with the vivid rainbow lights and shades of the majestic star garden glowing behind it. The floating bi dimensional symbol was more than a rare inter dimensional singularity. Its amazing diameter of 140.000 km from pole to pole and a thickness of 0 was the nest of the Ranam Cult's War Temple. The surface danced like flames, and the apparent deepness within the burning liquid energy was more than a beautiful illusion, it was the reflection of the Ranam inter-dimensional continuity. Inside, there was another world, another reality. A place no one could enter, and if some one miraculously could... He would disintegrate and the little that was left would drift inside the endless Ranam labyrinth; forever lost between layers of strange dimensions. But the labyrinth was not the only singularity inside, there was much much more... Towards the endless center rose the great land of Ranam, the \"True Paradise\", as the Ranams called it. The place were the many aliens assimilated by the Cult's strength and ideals lived and worked, prayed and obeyed; dedicating their lives and ideals to the progress and expansion of the Ranam Cult. All living in opulence and their own ideal of greatness. Their urban zones and cities were amazing in every sense of the word... The Ranam bio architecture was simply breath taking and splendorous; despite the outward dissimilarities between various temples and palaces conceived by several different alien races assimilated by the cult, beauty and opulence ruled in each one of them. There were also sacred symbols regarded as holy and divine by the cultist's prime religions all over them, symbols which had some degree of similarity with the Ranam's symbolism and philosophy. The meaningful and powerful symbols were clearly visible in the buildings and in their ornamentation, and even in the settings in which they have been placed. Each symbol, pillar, shrine, room or hall was inspired from the religious elements of the Ranam Cult, elements which formed an integral part of the Ranam way of life. The streets were covered with tales and the written history of the Ranam Cult. Tales of greatness and conquests, of delights and learned lessons, and more important, the cult's main commandments were conveniently placed and related to each important historical fact. All streets leaded to one gigantic temple in the center of the urban zone; the religious palace of Cindra, the keeper of the Ranam's way of life and wellness. The alien vegetation growing around the palace courtyard and the color of the courtyard walls declared loudly who was the herald in charge of that temple-palace. In this visual way, every cultist knew the allegorical meanings which the forms, the colors, and the statues in a temple are meant to convey and who was the temple's guardian and ruler. Cindra watched the bizarre bright pink sunset in the endless horizon and the large bristling cities that surrounded her palace whit doubts and concerns. Her slender and radiant gaseous body, now in solid state, was shining delightfully, enjoying the luminous caress of the artificial sun that was gently bathing her. She was fighting many unsolved questions in her heart almost the entire day; questions she didn't dared to ask her Great Prophet, Sarakh. Mainly because he was a true mastermind and the architect of the civilization that was considered one of the greatest powers in the universe. And also because Sarakh's generosity and power was as great as his rage and stubbornness. If he only were more open... But then again, he was, with his brother and confident: Dorvakh. But maybe she could find answers for some of her concerns, with the proper questions... Perhaps he would listen and give her doubts some relief. She told herself over and over she shouldn't doubt Sarakh's decisions. After all, he never failed the cult and always kept his promises; no matter how great or impossible they were. But this time... The cult seemed to be fighting for a cause so invisible and banal, that everything could be nothing more than a ridiculous personal feud from the great prophet; and that would be completely unacceptable. Cindra raised her hand, indicating the alien slaves that were perfuming her body to stop and leave her private quarters. She turned her head 180° with delicacy and told her personal slave to stay for a brief moment. Baku nodded with his long cigar shaped head and knelled down. Cindra walked to him graciously, caressed his head whit softness and went to her floating throne. The throne hall around them was an open balcony with an incomparable view of the impossibly large city surrounding her palace, and was designed to magnified the always impressive voice of the female alien general. She sat slowly and spoke. \"Look around you, at the face of glory, Baku. Look and tell me what you believe of it.\" \"I do not have the words nor the greatness to describe something that only your grace is capable of, my mistress.\" \"I see... and what about you, Baku? Are you complete? Don't you miss something of your past? Don't you feel empty sometimes?\" Baku lifted his head a bit, as much as he could; no Ranam citizen or warrior was allowed to look in the eyes of one of the god-generals, even less to Sarakh the Great. \"I have no reason to keep such attachments my mistress, and only allow myself a few memories to remind me of the desolation and weakness I was saved from. Now, I have everything I have ever wanted, even eternal life. \" Cindra was amazed at her personal slave's confidence and apparent unbreakable loyalty. But his answer was not the excuse her heart was looking for. \"What about your former gods? Don't you miss them? Are you not afraid of their rage?\" Baruk allowed himself a brief smile. \"Why should I fear, my mistress? The true gods, the Ranam gods, conquered me and my world. I pledged my ancient gods back then to save me, to protect me... And they did nothing! Despite everything I did to please them over my entire life! They betrayed my trust and deserved nothing but my rejection! Cindra looked at his slave with surprised eyes; his words shaped her own feelings and doubts. \"You abandoned your gods because you could not trust them?\" \"Yes my mistress, and will do it again without thinking it twice.\" \"I see…\" Cindra took the decision and turned her throne around, her face flushed with determination and courage. \"You may leave now, Baku.\" \"Yes, my mistress.\" Baku bowed ceremoniously and softly left the throne hall. Cindra's throne rose slowly. The richly ornamented hall opened like a blossoming flower, announcing she was leaving her palace. The lights of the great multicultural alien city below and beyond casted a marvelous shades of colorful lights that enhanced her majestic skin and the beautiful flying throne she was sitting on. Glancing upward, she saw the first artificial stars appearing in the young evening sky. Each night in the inner realty of the War Temple was different and breathtaking unique; changing every day to honor the home world's night sky of each race present. These stars were beautiful, but they weren't hers today. The aliens that noticed her throne soaring gently above the city bowed ceremoniously. Soon, every sufficiently intelligent life form bowed or saluted her religiously. She was a Demigoddess after all; a figure to fear and reverence; a model to look at and imitate. She was the guardian and ruler of the Ranam cities and every non military sentient being inside the temple. Beyond the limits of the bristling cities, crossing the sacred Ranam plains and bizarre mountains, was the inter dimensional gate that allowed her to pass to the other universe of the temple; the Mutalink Gardens. The Gate was enormous and made of thousand active mutalinks moving seemingly without pattern, like a wall of ants; but always keeping the perfect form of the gate. Cindra concentrated and an invisible power commanded the mutalinks to open the gate. The thousand little killing machines move to the edge of the gate, opening a circle from were a purple glow blew outwards. A pink mist started to flow from the other side. Cindra hurried up and penetrated the gardens. She gained altitude quickly and flew above the endless mutalink spawning grounds. The field was mostly covered by a giant inter dimensional grapevine plant from which the mutalinks were generated and spawned. Each mutalink slept and developed inside a dark blue fruit, similar to a grape but more ovoid in shape, with many brothers developing in the same cluster. Shym was moving softly among the vines, in an almost liquid form, like a water snake; checking the progress of a new breed of mutalinks. Perhaps the ones the cult will use in its next battle. Beyond the Mutalink Garden was the endless electric blue mantle of the Ocean of Doom. This bottomless ocean was the home and breading world of the most powerful weapon of the cult: the Broohm. Cindra increased her speed and flew considerably above the safe altitude; this place was the scariest of all within the temple for her. Even from far above the surface she could hear the broohm's roars from the ones swimming close to the surface, and occasionally spot one or two jumping high over the water. She could feel Dramuru down there, swimming among his entrusted monsters, ruling a kingdom no one would want to live in. She asked herself many times how could he and Shym live alone, only having the company of the cult's weapons to socialize with; the intelligence of the Mutalinks and the Broohms was very high, yes, but they were just thinking weapons; weren't they? A few ours later at supersonic speed and she finally reached the flying pillar of light floating over the center of the ocean; the bi dimensional doorway to the Altar of Commandments and the Great Propeht's temple. Cindra stooped in mid air and amplified the power of her aura. In an instant she shot out a single invisible power wave; like a perfectly transparent spherical flash. Her power signature reached even the far corners of the War Temple. She had just knocked the Great Prophet's door. Seconds latter, the pillar of light glowed whit unbearable intensity, forcing Cindra to look away, then exploded violently in a blinding flash. The blast morphed into a gigantic alien eye made entirely of multicolored dimensional flames; it looked at her powerfully. The eye's cat like pupil dilated until it became a perfect circle and became dark blue, allowing Cindra to enter the deepest levels of the War Temple; the exclusive domains where only two chosen could live. Inside, she turned her high speed flight into a gentle breeze; respect and obedience to the rules where among the most critical cult's commandments and not even Sarakh with his inter dimensional powers would bend that reality. The misty plains before the altar, far below, were covered by pumpkin like cocoons were the Hivors slept and morphed. The rare endless purple shaded sky around her had no clouds, but hundreds of Keelings flying around like curious ravens; its concentration increased significantly upon her arrival to the altar. The Altar of Commandments was one of the most important structures and the center of the cult's laws and judicial system. Inside it, Dorvakh decides the life and death of any criminal. And it also was the place where all of the cult's litigations were solved. It was an incredibly huge totem like structure that could also be described as a marvelous super tower, divided in ten different segments from bottom to top. Each segment was a deformed representation of one of the ten Ranam gods. But this huge eye catching structure was not her goal; she came to talk to the boss, to the supreme itself. Curiously, she could not sense the presence of Dorvakh inside the altar, even though she was ascending very close to it. The last Ranam deformed god was holding a huge perfectly polished and richly ornamented sphere, covered with symbols that were identical to Sarakh and Dorvakh's tattoos. The Ranam Great Prophet's Temple was the manifested symbol of the Ranam Faith, revealing the strength, power, and truthfulness of the great prophet's revelations. On the other hand, its elements showed respect for the basic beliefs of the cults past and origins; even having incorporated many new features to better represent the universality of Ranam, it was still clearly influenced and bounded to Sarakh's race and culture. The Temple acted as a constant reminder to the followers of Ranam that the path for the many was forever one. The temple complex consisted of the main house of worship; a visitor center, the forbidden library and the palace complex itself, as well as many secret places. Although it looked solid, it was an inter dimensional structure created to accommodate the leader of the cult: the strange and powerful alien that called himself Sarakh. Very little was know about Sarakh or his brother Dorvakh; some cult's legends mention that he and his brother were saved from their solar system's destruction by the Ranam gods and empowered to become the leaders and rulers from all living beings in the universe for they faithfulness. The gods had taught them the path of Ranam and entrusted the responsibility to \"open\" the hearts of every living creature in the universe to follow the path of Ranam at all cost. Those who refused should be return to the nothing, from were they came from and were they were surely end. Cindra waited and prayed to the Ranam goddess of beauty; she was not only her greatest inspiration, but also the source of her courage and strength. The goddess was never among the ten great gods at the beginning of time, but her strength and determination gave her the power to conquer her place among them; a place that was rightfully hers. And Cindra was about to face a challenge as great as that: to question the great prophet's motivations and decisions. It was a very serious issue; Sarakh was the voice of the Ranam gods, they speak through him. How could he be wrong? Cindra hesitated for a second and she was about to turn around, when a circular aperture formed in the giant sphere's south hemisphere. It was too late, or perhaps a sign from the gods… Cindra's throne advanced forward, to the perfectly empty dark interior. When the sphere closed behind her everything around changed marvelously. She was not levitating in a black void anymore, but over the gracefully ornamented floor of Sarakh's throne hall. The place was a completely different kind of reality. Sarakh the Great was sitting in his throne, before the main altar, built on top on the last prophets eternal rest place. There were floating memory symbols from all ages containing the memories of all the cult's previous prophets and the history from the civilizations conquered or destroyed by the cult; the tales of the Ranam gods, and in the small adjoining shrines the first patriarchs of Ranam. The decoration was overwhelming and in some places tenaciously opulent. Cindra quickly descended from her levitating throne and knelled down. Sarakh nodded and allowed her to stand up. \"Welcome Cindra. Is something afflicting your soul?\" \"No my lord, I...\" a cold and scary aura touched hers, it made her skin shiver. She suddenly looked at her right; the power signature was unmistakable. An impressive figure stepped out from the darkness, almost a reflection of the cult's great prophet: Dorvakh. \"So, here he is...\" Thought Cindra, and tried to deduce the reason. She couldn't find one so she left that mystery alone for now. She had a much greater dilemma in her hands: what was she going to tell Sarakh? \"...I was, concerned, about some citizens murmurs... It appears that there are a few Ranams that are asking ridiculous questions about the reasons relating to our battles in the last cycle. I heard some are arguing that our last campaigns had no goal at all. And as your servant I have come to seek your wisdom and guidance. Sarakh looked at Cindra as if he could read her deepest thoughts, and grinned maliciously. \"I could not expect less. Who?\" Cindra bowed deeper. \"I only know about the rumors, my lord. I beg your forgiveness for not identifying the ones yet.\" Sarakh smiled and gestured. \"I understand their concern. And after so many battles and glories in this long path, I wish to let them know how our journey ends.\" Sarakh sit up and a tattoo in his forehead morphed; his throne behind him vaporized. \"Rise Cindra, and celebrate with me the hour of our glory!\" \"Forgive me, my lord, but endless battles and unsolved questions had softened the sweet taste of power and victory in my heart. And I fear than many of your servants may feel the same way...\" \"Nonsense, my dear...\" Sarakh grinned and handled Cindra an alien flower floating nearby; she accepted and took it delighted. Cindra absorbed the flower, allowing its life to penetrate her body and give her an euphoric and pleasant sensation… The flower withered and literally dissolved in her hand. Cindra sighed delighted. \"Delicious, my Lord...\" For the Ranam heralds, the Darfold has always been the most delicious flower; it enjoyed unparalleled popularity throughout the high casts of the cult from the earliest times down to the present day. \"Thank you, my great prophet. It was wonderful...\" she murmured with a soft voice, almost hypnotized by the sensation. Sarakh gave one to his brother and enjoyed to flowers on his own. \"Not as wonderful has the glory yet to come, Cindra.\" \"Tell me about it, my Lord.\" Sarakh turned a bit more serious, but never lost his good humor. \"You usually never disappoint me Cindra.\" \"The stronger will inherit the universe; it is the law of the creation. I am one of them, and my efficiency testifies my superiority.\" Cindra enhanced. Sarakh took the subject in his hands and went deeper. \"Ah... Yes. But, are we already the strongest? Are we one with the gods?\" Cindra smiled, she knew how this little game was going to end, but decided to play it anyway \"We are among the strongest. Ranam is recognized has one of the most powerful forces in the universe. No one as ever dared to challenge your power, great Sarakh.\" \"You know as well as I dear, that to be one among others is not enough. We must be supreme!\" Sarakh pressed. Cindra knew Sarakh was right, but cycles of battles and study have told her that the supreme power Sarakh always referred to was nothing but an impossible dream. Or wasn't? \"Forgive me, my lord, but aren't we already supreme in our own way?\" Sarakh smirked opulently. He walked to the center of the hall and extended his four arms in a spiritual posture. The whole room transformed itself into a huge and advance holographic library were tales and ancient documents, historical images and millennial alien artifacts floated freely, each one more appealing than the other: the Forbidden Library. \"Not without the ultimate power... The ultimate weapon!\" Cindra lurked forward and frowned, more curious than convinced. \"And which is this weapon my lord is so eagerly seeking?\" Sarakh advanced through the holograms and played with them like a painter with the colors. He took the floating data and images and composed a beautiful and vivid story, full of life and drama; like an ideal musical composition where each note was perfectly placed. \"Legends, tales, myths... All information in the universe is composed of truths and lies. But the superior minds...\" He took a couple of ancient pup stories, and after breaking them in pieces, rearranged the data creating an impeccable new historical vision. \"...Can perceive the truths inside each tale and extract them to let them shine and enlighten! What do you know about Ituran, Cindra?\" \"The myth? A tragic story with a tragic end.\" \"Tragic indeed... But believe me, Cindra, there is more inside this myth than just fantasy and exaggerations. You see... There is really no such thing has a myth. All tales, lies or not, have some degree of truth, you just need to see deep enough… Our battles and conquest have paid us well, for they have opened us the knowledge and the path to the ultimate weapon, which indeed, the Iturans created many eons ago as the myth tells us.\" Sarakh went on, showing holograms about a long forgotten civilization; the images were so vivid that it appeared to be a freshly produced documentary. \"Ituran was perhaps the most powerful civilization of the young universe, maybe even the first to reach the stars. But unluckily for them, their pacifism became their demise... This ancient tales explain how they were conquered and submitted. And because of their stubbornness to obey any authority beyond themselves they were eventually exterminated by their conquerors; all of them, except two. Two brothers who managed to escape the talons of death and swore to avenge their civilization and themselves by creating an unstoppable weapon. Two brothers with the same goal, but different visions as the time revealed. But obviously it was impossible to create something better than what the Almighty Creator conceived, so they searched the stars for eons in the hope to find the perfect raw material to reshape it into their dreamed Armageddon machine. And they found it! Both creations had the same based matrix and were 60% identical, but it was that 40% than changed everything...\" Sarakh turned to the impressive holograms of the two alien brothers displayed at his left; they looked almost identical: one was slightly taller and had paler skin, while the other's skin was darker and had more sinister eyes; the ayes of an assassin. Sarakh started with the shorter one. \"The younger of the two, Bertron, was consumed by revenge and could not think on anything else but to eventually destroy the responsible for the horrendous fate of his kind. While Raoron, his older brother, dreamed to recreate his lost civilization out of his \"perfect\" beings, to produce a new life form hat would never be killed again nor conquered. Sharing practically the same goal both brothers worked together fanatically, only until Bertron's hate and Raoron's dream finally separated them. But each one continued their own quest to create their \"perfect weapon\" or \"perfect being\" independently. The final creations of both were as similar as two Darfold flowers, but has different has night and day. Bertron was the first to achieve his goal, for his creation had many less demanding properties. But his weapon was everything it promised to be and more... It was a perfect and sadistic reflection of his twisted heart; an almost immortal monster, brutal in every way. A killing machine, slightly more intelligent than an infant; incapable of achieving any high intelligence level or to experience feelings. \"What happened to that abomination?\" \"It turned to be so powerful and blindly aggressive than it became impossible for Bertron to contain or dominate it. And finally, it killed his own maker\" Sarakh laughed \"How ironic and stupid… to be killed by your own weapon.\" Cindra looked at the monstrous Doomsday creature Bertron had created and a dozen questions arouse in her mind, the most obvious surfaced first. \"And that beast is the weapon we are seeking?\" Sarakh grinned and disappeared the monster's image. \"No, Cindra... Of course not. To manipulate an uncontrollable weapon is like playing with a time bomb. No... We are seeking the true perfect weapon. Raoron's creation!\" Bertron's image vanished, leaving his older brothers hologram to dominate the view in the library. \"Raoron was not a blind vengeful spirit like his brother. But rather a sentimental artist as well as a genius; he created a destructive poetry, a killing flower, merging beauty and endless power in one discreet form.\" Sarakh gestured and two magnificent holograms of a male and a female human like bodies emerged from the data streams aside Bertron. Sarakh's voice could no longer conceal his enthusiasm as he explained. \"Perfectly adaptable, creative and highly intelligent. Two genders, pure and unthinkable power!\" Cindra's face didn't share his master's enthusiasm and gave her away. She was not even slightly impressed, but overly disappointed. If there was a great secret behind this, she decided she needed to know it right now. \"That puny being is Raoron's ultimate weapon? It looks nothing but weak and fragile.\" Sarakh laughed loud \"But of course! That's what makes it even more dangerous! That it appears fragile and harmless... But inside...\" Sarakh revealed her the astonishing data he kept hidden for decades. Cindra's mouth opened in shock, a long dormant feeling woke up for the first time in many cycles: the fear for something or someone beside Sarakh. \"That cannot be true!\" She looked at Sarakh directly in the eyes, violating one of the most important rules of the cult, clearly terrified and worried at the same time. \"But it is! Like Bertron's Doomsday creature, Raoron's creation is also triggered by the stars.\" A beautiful hologram of a young sun appeared between Sarakh and Cindra. \"But his version is much more efficient than Bertron's, and according to the diary of one of his slaves, much more powerful and lethal, but more difficult to master as well; since its full potential can only be achieved under the creature's conscious control.\" The big sun hologram shrunk a little and a young solar system surged around it. \"After Bertron's creation murdered his own \"father\" and eventually escaped the world where it was born, Raoron feared he would eventually face the same fate and took precautions about it. He ingeniously devised a simple and efficient way to keep his exquisite creation under control\" The holographic sun turned red. \"Red sunlight! It would trigger the nature of his creation to turn it extremely weak and dependable. And to honor his death brother, Raoron continued his work in the same world were Bertron's creature was born. The system's red star would keep them week enough to be docile and controllable, has Raoron wanted, allowing him to continue his work with some serenity. Sarakh walked around the red star system's hologram, approaching Cindra has he spoke. \"But after his brother died, and even with all the precautions he envisioned and applied, he was still afraid... Afraid he would receive the same punishment for playing with a power he could not control, and came to a particular moment were he wanted to terminate his creation. But marvelously, his love for his creature and the hope of achieving his dream was greater than his fear. So, he hoped and waited... He watched his living weapons develop a culture; he saw how they procreated and tamed the planet. And very soon, he realized that time and wonder had turned him into more than just a creator overseeing his work, they turned him literally into a god. A god who would decide the course and the history; the life and the death of its custom made civilization called Krypton. And believe me; he enjoyed it for millennia, more than anything else before... Sarakh turned to his brother. Dorvakh stood there, unmovable; with a proud and cold look in his eyes as his brother keep explaining. \"But sadly... All stories come to an end. The civilization he created became very advance, and although religious and social laws prohibited their citizens to leave their own solar system and thus preventing them to achieve their immense power; their probes and AI researchers quickly gave them a vast knowledge about the universe. Raoron had slaves infiltrated has they're rulers and high priests. And the practically impeccable obedience and disciplined attitude of his living weapon hold it in check. But it did not work forever. His personal slave chronicles explain that some of them became violent and rejected the laws and principles their god \"Rao\" gave them, becoming a danger for Raoron's custom created civilization and for the universe if they ever got loose. The slave specified that some reports informed that one particular kryptonian apparently discovered the unimaginable power that lied deep inside him. This slave always suspected that some information leaked and somehow reached him, but couldn't prove it. But the damage was done, and Raoron soon realized that he could lose control. He knew it was a matter of time, brief time, so his fears became alive again. Raoron then decided to terminate his creation and himself, incapable of dealing with the emotional weight and love he had developed for them. He detonated the system's red star, destroying everything and everyone in it.\" Cindra grinned and went to drink another flower that floated nearby. \"A wonderful story...\" She absorbed the flower completely, enjoying every ounce of it, dramatizing the moment before the obvious question. \"So where is the survivor?\" Sarakh generated a floating data symbol between his shiny claws, it glowed like fire. \"Survivors, Cindra... Survivors! A whole pack from which to form an unstoppable army! The army that will kneel the universe down before us and will give me the secret of divinity.\" \"And how...\" Cindra glanced again at the elegant images of the two humans and the impossible data that flowed endlessly beside each one \"...are we going to make such powerful beings our servants? Are we just going to ask them to serve us?\" Sarakh perceived the contemptuous tone in Cindra's voice; he dint like it at all. \"Watch your sarcasm Cindra... You know my cruelty, as well as my intelligence... This pack of kryptonians survived because of an improvisation, a very lucky improvisation! According to the data we recently conquered, a technician in the surviving city was testing a new way of space travel the day their sun was detonated by Raoron. He desperately created a trans-space bubble around most of the city, and managed to drag it to the inner space were they managed to build a sheltered city and the necessary means to survive. They have been there ever sense... With no contact with the appropriated sunlight that would awake they're hidden power.\" Cindra was not afraid of challenges, but if she was going to put her neck against dozens of unbelievably powerful beings, she'd better know everything. \"If they are so advance how come they haven't try to return to normal space and found a colony on another planet?\" \"Culture, religion and fear!\" Sarakh gestured. \"A very powerful combination, don't you think?\" \"So that's what we were looking for... I understand the need for secrecy now, my lord. And now we are almost there?\" Sarakh approached Cindra and stood a mere inch apart from her. \"We are already there! Each and every Ranam, except you...\" Cindra never noticed Sarakh's second right arm moving at her left. Two clawed fingers merged together and a powerful drill shaped beam shot out from it. The liquid energy crossed through Cindra's abdomen and began disrupting her body like fire burning paper. Sarakh roared in her face. An indescribable pain punished Cindra's body and her mind twisted like a pretzel. Her life force burned out and her marvelous strength perished. She shook and cried loud as her body vaporized without remedy. \"Why?\" \"You doubted me! Cindra... And you above all should know that the doubt is the beginning of disobedience, the root of all rebellion! And besides...\" He looked deep into her eyes one last time. \"You choose knowledge over loyalty.\" And let her vanish. Sarakh looked at his brother; Dorvakh chanted a soft prayer to honor the fallen member of the cult. After finishing his brief religious duty, he approached his brother and knelled down ceremoniously. \"Brother, the curiosity in my heart is great. I beg you to release some of it; please tell me how do you plan to control Raoron's living weapon?\" Sarakh grinned and touched a floating symbol. The room transformed again acquiring the unmistakable form of the inner chamber of the Ranam Vault. More than a vault, it was a fortress full of trophies, treasures, and countless data bases from millions of races of the known universe. Sarakh floated forwards, closely followed by his brother, to the most secured and safest place of the War Temple: the inner sphere. The inner sphere was a two hundred yard, richly carved sphere that opened as if were made of liquid metal, allowing Sarakh and his brother to penetrate inside. Entering was like entering a living cell, but the defensive organoids didn't attack them. Sarakh and his brother reached the center with ease. The cult's leader landed on the misty floor and walked proudly towards the core of the sphere; the ovoid safe opened like a blossoming alien flower, revealing several colored crystals floating inside liquid transparent seeds. Sarakh took the green one first. \"Raoron was a genius… That is beyond any question; and an exquisite artist as well. The green gem is the termination instrument.\" He put it back and took the red one. \"And the red gem is the control instrument!\" \"But Brother, how can a puny radioactive mineral control or terminate a living weapon as powerful as those? That makes no sense! They are practically invincible and invulnerable according to your data; a radiation capable of harming them that way, or penetrate their structures simply does not exist!\" Sarakh smiled delighted, giving the answer away before he spoke. \"You are absolutely correct! The true termination and control elements are part of the weapons itself; it is not really the mineral's radiation that does it. Its different kinds of unique radiations are input commands. The commands they generate trigger the functions inside the weapon's beings that controls it, or kills it, or...\" He gestured to the other crystals, delighted. There were so many... Each one exhibiting a different color, each one with a specific function. \"Produces many other interesting effects...\" He grabbed the black one \"We could suppress the positive emotional parameters of the weapon and turn it into a sadistic destructive being, similar to Bertron's creation.\" He put it back and took the purple one. \"Or we could shift them out of this phase and hold them there until we need to use them...\" this time Dorvakh smiled viciously. \"Like carrying one in your pocket until the moment you need it?\" Sarakh laughed loudly. \"Yes my brother! Like having one in your pocket for quick use!\" He grabbed the red one again. \"Or we could just turn them into the obedient triumph weapon they were meant to become in the first place.\" Sarakh's brother smiled elated and knelt proudly before his brother; his heart full of pride, admiration, fear and obedience. \"You are the greatest Prophet in our entire history brother and I am your servant; let this and the known galaxies to tremble before the glory of Ranam!\" Sarakh's ego flew triumphant to the stars with that delightful praise. But... \"Still, my beloved brother, it is complicated in its own way. Even after a long time, I have barely begun to understand the control process of the red crystal. It is very difficult to master and quite elusive; if done incorrectly, the weapon's mind would produce erratic behaviors and undisciplined tendencies. We are close, yes! But we may require more time than predicted after the capture to fully submit them under my control.\" \"So be it! Your orders brother?\" \"Ranam will go to war! Our Divine ascension is near, and when we become gods, the true life will be ours forever!\" With that said he transported both back to the throne hall and sat in his floating throne \"Dive the War Temple inside the inner space brother, and take us to our eternal destiny!\" Sahrak throne sank into the floor, as the room started to change again. Below, a fantastically large hall composed of military structures and colossal platforms, ships, war machines and endless lines of disciplined warriors saluted Sarakh as he hovered above them. \"The time has come followers of Ranam! Now, after countless battles and endless searching we have found the power of the gods! Lets us charge and take what the universe as given to us, to the strongest!\" The endless crowd shouted mesmerized in an orchestra of thousands of different sounds and languages. Sarakh gave them a little more circus. \"You believed in me, and did well! I gave you power, to each of you, I gave you revenge, and all the pleasures you desired!\" The crowd cheered his name without pause. \"But it is nothing compared to the pleasures we will enjoy very soon, endless pleasure and power!\"[Chapter 3] Argo City The darkness of the inner space was deep and cold, quiet and vast, but not omnipresent. Floating nebular lakes and dust clouds of countless colors swam graciously in the endless emptiness. Far beyond one of many invisible clusters of gravimetric currents laid an ocean of colored gas shaped in the form of a gigantic deformed eye; if Jupiter would have been a cloud, it would look much like it. But the power that conquered that infinite solitude, that starless emptiness was not the mighty and scarce phenomena that inhabited it, but a woman flying marvelously in the darkness. The girl was flying and dancing gracefully in the void, soaring towards the near storming cloud, irradiating beauty and kindness. Her angelical face was her most notorious feature. Her eyes, full of innocence, shined in an inhuman aqua blue color and displayed a beauty and youthfulness that was capable of conquering every heart; two living sapphires set in a perfect female face. Her lips were rich, full and pink, emphasized by a triumphant smile. Her long, smooth blond hair cascaded almost to her waist, shining in the darkness like a golden flame. Her nose was cute and her ideal high cheeks had a wonderful natural blush. She was wearing a perfectly elastic and intelligent white full body-suit emblazoned with the symbol of her family in mirror silver, the crest of the House of El. The suit's beauty and complexion was beyond anything humanly conceivable, whose beauty was only exceeded by the perfect female that molded it. She was fit and toned, slightly muscular. Her shoulders were broad and her long legs were perfectly proportioned. Her generous breasts stood proudly on her chest and stretched the shiny symbol above them perfectly. Her abdominal muscles were defined and clearly visible in the tight suit. Her waist was ideally narrow, preceding a pair of perfectly proportioned hips and idyllically defined legs. Everything about her was angelical… She extended her arms like two mighty wings; like years ago, when she conquered the blue skies and swam across countless white cotton clouds of the beautiful blue world their inhabitants called earth. She flew downwards and to her right for a few seconds, then straightened her course and hugged her extended legs and spun like a tornado, displaying a matchless flexibility. She broke the movement suddenly, straightened her body and shooting upwards in a mighty vertical ascension. Twenty stunned pairs of exited little eyes watched her without pause, holding their breaths has her protector continued with her hypnotic cosmic ballet; conquering their admiration. The little boys and girls where all of similar ages, athletic and witty, all wore a similar bodysuit but less showy than hers. Each one smiled elated and cheered her trough their mental link. Kara was, as they kept repeating to their parents, the most wonderful teacher in Argo. Kara Zor-El executed a perfect barrel roll and flew back to her place in the disciplined flight formation of her entrusted students. Their trilling little faces where shining joy, their hearts wishing for her to teach them how to fly in that marvelous way. She went forward and to the center. \"Kara, where did you learn to fly that way?\" Asked the youngest kryptonian girl in Kara's learning conclave; more than hungry to learn her teacher's secrets. Her teachers answer was the same again; the vault from Kara's exiting tales and secrets. \"Earth\" She smiled and blinked at the little girl, giving her another alien gesture she learned in that fantasy world as they continued their short trip. The storming nebula was close now, spiting random eruptions very similar to powerful solar eruptions, but distinctively more violent, blending their warm colors in swirls. Kara stooped at a prudent distant of one of the inner space's class B storm nebula. This one was relatively close to Argo, and curiously near the jump point she used years ago to travel to earth in Zaltar's spaceship. She then turned to her class and began to explain the science behind the constantly changing nebula and the forces inside it, while the kids mentally commanded their Nexus bracelets on their left wrists to harvest and process all data from the phenomena, and also to store Kara's mental knowledge. The Nexus bracelets where one of the many superior examples of kryptonian's marvelous technology, merging all necessary functions to serve and protect the user in all needs from the biologic to the mental spectrum. Each bracelet produced a holographic data bubble around the user, only visible by him or her alone, displaying marvelous and vivid images and oceans of data as well as feeding their minds with all information directly, without relying on the subjects senses. Kara explained about the astonishing eruptions that blasted out from time to time and instructed the kids to get near her; another part of her marvelous field adventure was about to take place. They were going to approach one of the coordinates her Nexus bracelet indicated as an upcoming eruption and observe it closely; as close as safety would allow them to. The kids took their hands and gathered around Kara in guild formation. The young kryptonian teacher drifted towards the exact point in the morphing nebula, close to a vortex of blending colors. Still…there was a beautiful harmony in that seemingly contradictory chaos of forces and extreme visible and invisible energy emissions; it was like watching a blasting cocoon from where a beautiful energy butterfly would suddenly arise. Everyone was watching with great concentration, focused on the information their Nexus bracelets were feeding their minds with, and keeping their young innocent eyes into the growing mound in the cloud. Booomm! The eruption blossomed with such force that the group was blown backwards dozens of miles. More than an eruption, it was like a witnessing the birth of a firestorm, a storm where waves upon waves of dancing energies and matter where propelled to the outside with the strength of a nuclear blast. The kids laughed and screamed in sweet joy with nothing but pure excitement filling their faces. Kara laughed too, and hugged the group around her tightly. The colorful blast engulfed them like a tornado swallowing a formation of intrepid birds, taking them in a powerful and unforgettable ride. The forces around them where vast, spinning and shaking the group rapidly and powerfully, but at that distance the strength of the blast ad already dissipated enough to pose them no harm. When the explosion finally dissipated in the dark infinite, and the group managed to stabilize, the kids could not contain they joy and gratitude. Everyone was laughing and talking about how awesome it felt, and the incredible lights and forces that surrounded them; and of course, about their teacher's wonderful idea. \"Thank you Kara! This was amazing; you are the best teacher in the universe! The little kid, the youngest male, hugged her defined waist in a gesture of pure gratitude. Then the others started a cute symphony of gratitude that blush her dedicated guardian. Kara returned each gesture and thanksgiving with her own ones. She formed the group from the oldest to the youngest, and then she noticed it. \"Where is Ral?\" She looked at the group to check again each little face, and then everywhere. \"Did someone see Ral? Did he return without us?\" Cir, the youngest one denied with her head and spoke before anyone else. \"I didn't see him returning, Kara.\" \"None of us did.\" reassured Jhan-Ar, the oldest of the group. Kara mentally contacted Argo's conscience and requested aid to locate her missing student. The answer was practically instantaneous, and guided her piercing blue eyes to a specific point; dangerously close of the nebula. Ral stood before the monstrous phenomenon's chaotic light opera, closer than her teacher and the rest of his fellow students had dared to be. He was afraid, but the excitement and the curiosity in his heart were much stronger than his fears; so he observed and waited, counting the last instants before the mighty eruption than will give him the ride of his life; as he was expecting; a moment to be proud of and to remember for the whole eternity. His nexus bracelet went wild with readings and warning pulses, jelling at him in its special psychic language, showing him a world of information and data that only his mind could see. Kara spotted him and her bracelet's mind warned her intermittently about her student's imprudence and the dangerous consequences of his disobedience. She called him again through the mental network, with a more severe tone, and flew towards him as fast as she could. He didn't answer, and scared or not stood still anyways, modifying parameters and settings with his bracelet; hoping that he could… Booomm! Ral opened his eyes wildly, like never before, as the enormous detonation literally swallowed him completely before shooting outwards with him in its entrails. Kara halted her futile rescue attempt as close from the magnificent waves of the explosion as she could. It was too late... Ral screamed and spun out of control in the stomach of the blast, his figure distorted progressively until it dissolved into nothing; disintegrated by the powerful waves he foolishly tried to defy and enjoy. Kara stood still and released a long and deep sigh from her angelical lips. Above her, all the remaining students were laughing loud and making jokes and funny comments about Ral's stubbornness and failed experiment. She let the matter go and flew back to her class; the day was only beginning and she already received a terrible problem to deal with. How would she explain this to Ral's parents? They would definitely be very unhappy about it. The return flight back was always special; as one of their poets who made the trip said: \"There is no emotion, no sensation as marvelous and appealing as contemplating the majestic shapes of Argo City growing from a small shiny dot, like a distant star to a luminous gigantic city, bright and majestic like a perfectly shaped diamond\". Argo City was not just a modest kryptonian city resting peacefully over a floating chunk of its home world anymore; breaking the unbreakable void with warm light and life. Not just a humble refuge that once almost experienced extinction years ago when one of the four Omegahedrons that powered her was lost, but a much larger, completely developed inner space city. She now floated in the darkness with pride, like and eternal monument, breaking the unbreakable void with warmth and life. And today she was not more surrounded by four photonic satellites that provided light and warmth, but illuminated by a true small artificial red sun, reduced to fit the city's natural light needs. Argo City, Kara's home, became Krypton's lifeboat for a practically nonexistent margin. It was once the most modern kryptonian city, envisioned as an advanced research and development center on the planet. Now, the pure atmosphere that filled it completely was constantly filtered and reprocessed. The new dome was not the old clear plasti-steel dome that covered the small community when she was 18 but a new heavy resistant crystalline shield reinforced by a dimensional barrier that covered it completely. After the disaster, and the miracle of their salvation, life came back to normal; as normal as it could be. In the new shielded artificial sky, the glow of the artificial red star that surrounded the more developed and elegant city gave the night a magnificent kryptonian twilight show. Life always goes forward... Kara led her class to circumvent the small red star in a close formation, to experience the blessing of the sun's hot red radiation first hand. They laughed and spun, delighted with the tickling sensation of the countless solar energies bathing and passing through them. Then, finally, the star of the show: Argo City; their home… The crystalline metropolis at already reached full standard development two years ago and now could expand and reshape with safety and according to its inhabitants needs. Kara was the first to approach one of the many potential airlocks that could be manifested around the octagonal belt that surrounded the city. Each student closed the smooth and shiny crystalline wall that in some segments appeared to be a fusion between crystalline and metallic matter. She requested the ruling conscious to create airlocks for each of them, and like a father granting a wish to her daughter, the frictionless crystalline surface gained life; opening like intelligent water and assuming the correct shape, with living kryptonian ornaments and symbols around the opening. Kara smiled elated and concentrated one more time; her figure started to vanish, like vanishing mist, reshaping into a small bright crystal as big as a small refrigerator, with elegant curves and symmetrical edges; an inner space mental probe. All children turned into identical crystals that entered the mighty floating city in perfect formation and coordination. The airlocks closed behind them, becoming part of the huge reinforced perimeter wall once again. All probes rested in their correspondent nests and morphed into their fundamental forms, all but Ral's one; pulverized by the might of the inner space storm he dared to challenge. Kara was floating in mid air, in the center of one of the academy's gravity pools, surrounded by her class. Kryptonian academies where like huge futuristic cathedrals dedicated to the accumulation and distribution of knowledge. It had its own mental laboratories and amusement centers, and was not only the place where kryptonians gathered to cultivate their minds, but also their bodies. The gravity pools where special environments where all could exercise and link their minds with probes and AI researchers to travel trough the universe for study and discovery. All eyes opened while smiles and giggles blossomed in every face; the mental fusion between the class and the crystalline probes had ended. To meld your mind with a research probe was a speechless experience; it was like living your body to assume another one, to become a new creature; with new capabilities and possibilities. The artificial conscious ruling the class's physical forces lowered them to the shiny crystalline floor softly, gently turning them to gravity's grip once again, and vanished the inner space's perfect illusion softly; revealing the marvelous celestial hues of the gravity pool's structure. Ral was nowhere to be seen; he ran home as soon as his mind fusion with the probe's AI was broken; unable to bear the weight of his insubordination. Disobedience was a serious sin on Krypton; a crime almost as bad as murdering and severally punished among adults in case of committing it. Kara felt the urge to look for him him, to tell him everything was fine, to forgive him and work it out for his wellness. But she couldn't do it now, she had other responsibilities left. She thought about what the academy's overseer was going to do about it and talked to him mentally trough the collective mind. She explained her version briefly but convincingly. The overseer agreed to let her handle the matter on her discretion; she was, after all, the savior of Argo. Every last kryptonian would have been death right now if it weren't for her. Kara thanked Rao for the power and the influence she had been empowered with since her returning and remembered herself again never to abuse it, and only use it on right moment. Huge 45° tilted crystalline pillars flanked the edges of the pool, two of them reshaped to form a beautifully ornamented exit. But they were not ready jet; there was one more exercise before the last part of the class. Kara adjusted the settings for the gravity field that would be affecting each one individually. Each setting according to the kid's strengths and endurance, and commanded the pool to increase the power of gravity. Her setting was notably high, as high as a kryptonian athlete would use to train if there where athletes in krypton. For the kids the training routine was simple and efficient, consisting on synchronized jumps, short runs and a slow dance that required an elaborated effort of each body part to be perfectly executed, and perfect it was; with an emphasis on complex positions and balance. Kara hover, used a radically different training routine than any other kryptonian; a unique and attractive combination of a traditional kryptonian dance and a human discipline called gymnastic. It was very chic and eye catching; it took the kids as much strong will to perfectly execute their exercises than to avoid being distracted bay Kara's wonderful jumps and her astonishing strength display. Kara's training became vigorously intense in the last part. She was almost constantly in the air, with only momentary contact with the floor. Her final move could only be described as fascinating: she spun and rolled in the air five times, making her body behave like a wild cyclone, and finally landed in a loud thud, extending her arms in a perfect salute, like she saw a human girl make on TV, back on earth. Her shining teeth reflected the brightness of the light around her. The kids were watching every last move, completely hypnotized by the speed and strength of her movements. No one else in Argo jumped or moved like her; Kara was in all senses a unique person, full of surprises and beautiful secrets. Nim-Ar was bold enough to approach and ask the question everyone wanted to make. \"How… How did you do that?\" babbled Nim, with his mouth still wide open. Kara approached him and caressed his hair. Nim always liked that a lot. \"Would you like to do the same?\" Her adorable smile was encouraging and perfect, growing only affection and trust in the heart of Nim. Nim-Ar grinned ear-to-ear and nodded vigorously. Kara sat on her knees and kissed his forehead. \"But only if you promise to teach it to everyone who wants to learn it too. And it will only be possible if you put on it all your will and one big secret…\" \"Which is?\" \"Time and love, Nim. Everything you want to do well need these two things\". \"I will never forget it Kara!\" Nim-Ar hugged Kara with a heart full of joy. Kara lifted him and looked at her class. \"Ready for the most important part?\" \"Ready!\" shouted back all kids simultaneously, with excitement. The group exited the gravity pool and each one of them, from Kara to the youngest, stepped over an octagonal shaped disc in the floor near the pool. Yellow, red and blue shiny symbols glowed powerfully on its surface and a pillar of light surrounded each one. In an instant, the body suits disappeared and everyone was wearing their respective domestic clothing. Kara's all day body-suit was white and her robe bright pink, emblazoned with the symbol of the house of El over her chest. The kids used a similar garment, with the color motif of each family's house and the respective symbol. They walked to a crystal chapel with crystal pillars as high as skyscrapers and huge bright walls that shone with a pleasant light. There was a huge altar in the center of the chapel and a representation of the kryptonian sun god Rao floating over it; it was essentially a huge crystalline sun, bright as the brightest diamond, with a touch of red in the right proportion to give the perfect effect. Kara and the kids formed a circle in front of the altar and sat in the floor. Cir-Ur was more eager to know more about her new teacher and her adventures than to praise her god, and couldn't wait to ask. \"Kara, tell us what is earth like. Tell us again, please…\" Kara smiled graciously. She took the young little girl at her side and sat her on her lap. \"It is a beautiful place, Cir. The sky is majestic and blue as your eyes. At night it is full of scintillating stars and there is a silver moon that shines almost every day. The sun is very bright, magnificent and yellow. When the sunset comes, it turns gold and finally red; just like Rao was back at krypton and like our artificial sun outside. There is so much life on earth that you could spend hundreds of years studying each amazing creature, from microscopic life forms to animals the size of a house… The landscapes are more than breath taking; each is unique and remarkable wonderful, like an ideal musical were each instrument and voice had been perfectly chosen and placed. \"I want to visit earth!\" \"Me too!\" another kid jumped in delight. Kara smiled and looked at each one's eyes with a tender smile. \"Sadly, not everything is perfect. The vast majority of the people who lives there is not as civilized or good earthed as we are. Humans are very selfish, and do bad things to each other, many times without remorse; even to the ones they love...\" \"Why?\" another girl in the group asked, whit her sweet and tender voice. \"I believe because almost always they care more about themselves than they do towards their fellows, Nira. They all need each other as we do, but strangely... Most times, they act as if they didn't.\" \"Did bad people hurt you when you were there, Kara?\" She didn't want to spoil the precious fantasy the kids were starting to dream about earth; \"The beautiful earth.\" she though. But then... she remembered her tears and pains, and decided that the truth was always better than a false dream no matter how pleasant it where. \"Yes, darling. Bad people hurt me back there. More than once.\" \"Why?\" Kara caressed Cir's chin and looked at her innocent aqua blue eyes, staring curiously into hers. \"It is difficult to understand, Cir. Human motivations are strange, confusing and sometimes… scary and dark. But remember that there are many other races in the universe that act in a similar way. And worse…\" Kara smiled again and stood up. The day was beautiful, and she wanted to give the children the happiness and security she felt in them before the sad part of her tale. \"And that's why there is no better or more beautiful place than home!\" She walked to the center of the circle. Every one raised their hands and began the praying ritual, dancing and moving their hands gracefully in the air, in a soft and enchanting routine. Cir-Ur was the chosen for the loud prayer gift today. She prayed loud and delicately, harmonizing her words and movements with her dance. \"Great Rao, we are your children forever. Remember us every day and night. Look upon us with mercy and keep us safe from the darkness beyond your light. Keep us together forever, feed us whit your generous hand and show us your perfect will day after day. Keep us from disobedience and write the eternal words of your laws in our hearts. Do not let us fall in sin and selfishness. We obey you forever, praise you forever, and follow you forever.\" The kids held each other's hands around Kara and looked up, their eyes closed and minds focused. Each prayed personally for his family and Kara. At the end of the ritual the kids hugged Kara and wished her a magnificent day, full of blessings and joy. Kara gave the children a heart touching good bye and went to the small crystal grove at a niche in a far wall and extended her hand. The grove shined and sang a pleasant combination of marvelous musical tones. One of the protruding crystals detached and flew to her hand. She picked it and watched as it changed its long octagonal shape to the well know symbol she was wearing proudly on her chest, the crest of the house of El. She issued a mental command and the small crystalline gem flew to her waist and held position one millimeter at her side, like held by a invisible, but without touching her. She then allowed herself another sigh and looked at her god's tangible representation. \"I will need all the help you can give me, mighty Rao…\" After a silent praying she left the academy and summoned her inner strengths for the task ahead: to save one of her student's present, and perhaps even his future. Ral-Ta had a somewhat difficult temper for kryptonian standards, and that had cost his parents a god night of sleep more than once. They were constantly fearing that their son might develop the same terrible and dangerous behavior patterns of the few but never forgotten criminals of Krypton. He had disobeyed before, but never a direct authority empowered by the science council like her; he was now dangerously close to cross the thin tolerance line his people had over sin. And if that was the case, he would be separated from his parents and held in a special installation for study and treatment; for the first time in many decades. So she had only one last card to play right now: to become his personal mentor. A position that 'The Savior of Argo' could request and get with relative ease due to her very strong influence. But that would mean that their relationship from that point on was going to be close to a mother-son like with special obligations for her; she would be directly responsible for all his achievements… and failures. The law would treat her as his conscience, his second soul and could even punish her severally for his mistakes. And if that were not enough, she would have to invest a considerable amount of time in him. The temple's breath taking entrance was enormous, and the crystalline stairs that lead to the temple's gardens and finally to the street shinned like transparent gold under the red light that flooded the beautiful kryptonian sky above. She looked at the artificial star and the awesome illusion of the long lost sky of their death world; it was simply perfect… It looked exactly like before the cataclysm, a way to help the inhabitants to remember their glorious past and be more comfortable. As she walked past the gardens filled with notorious statues and kryptonian bizarre flowers she received countless request to join in several mental networks, and even a special request for a mind meld from the city's conscious. All information was transmitted in real time among everyone so the information known by one was also known by the group; the where especial safeties to protect each ones privacy and personal information. But even so it could become overwhelming at times. She avoided the teleporting pads at the entrance of the gardens and entered the main crystalline circulatory system of the city; she was one of the few ones who preferred to walk from one place to another, using the teleporters only when necessary. The city's main circulatory system was a series of tubes, tunnels, roads and air ducts that formed an interconnected network within the city. Curiously, there were no vehicles moving around the broad and perfectly clean crystalline streets but many probes and robots that flew at a prudent altitude and everywhere you could see; taking care of the city's wellness and all necessary tasks. Kryptonian streets where not only different than human's ones but very special on their own way; all where equipped with vast amusing areas full of interesting places and refreshment areas, gravity sofas, virtual reality floating crystals that interacted with they Nexus bracelets and teleporters statically design and placed according to their location to mention a few of them. They streets could be better described as amusement parks that connected the different sectors of the city. Each one was unique and remarkable; with enormous structures, statues, sculptures and floating data crystals, as well as shrines where people could pray as desired to a smaller version of their deity; shaped as a perfect sphere; beautiful as a pearl, appealing as a diamond, attractive as a star. A few hundred yards away was the most crowded part of the city; she saw her beloved art malls with many of Zaltar's works, museums, music laboratories, wedding temples, more recreation parks, crystal conception and research chambers, universal cartography chambers, geneticall vaults, biological research and generation centers and much more. Beyond downtown was the long and high \"Bridge of Hoppe\", stretching over the holographic kryptonian horizon. She crossed the amazing crystalline bridge made of thousands of floating octagonal disks that chanted tones and changed their color according to the person stepping on them to cross over the only lake in the city; more than a lake, it was the place where kryptonians could simulate and remember the destroyed krypton's aquatic ecosystem, where they could swim large distances and interact with holographic versions of their destroyed aquatic life forms. She looked above, tears of joy caressed her young checks; above and beyond was another little but breathtaking kryptonian landscape to help the people to remember their past, it looked more than real; the red sun was high in the artificial sky, the colors where the very much like the ones she saw at earth during the sunset. She continued her long walk almost alone, like if she was one of only a few souls in the city; most of her fellows preferred to use the transporters instead of walking like a few exotic kryptonians like herself. Kara crossed another relatively shorter and smaller bridge from where she could delight her eyes with a huge abyssal crystalline canyon. she could see the citadels and temples that where carved within the crystals and the stark white terrain of jagged frozen plateaus, stretching broadly around her. It was also an illusion, of course, but it was still beautifully realistic and a memory to treasure and never forget. Tomorrow, another illusion was to be projected and everybody, including her, where already exited and couldn't wait to see what it would be; but in her brief joy another more urgent matter struggled for her attention and won it: Ral… She noticed a Lysis crystal common to the residential area and knew she was close to Ral's home, close to the moment of truth. Part of her wanted to turn around and go home, letting Ral and his parent solve his dilemma themselves; after all, it was their responsibility, not hers... It was justice...but not mercy, and she wanted to give him mercy. She lost her toughs on the flying crystal again synthesizing in her sharp mind its essence; Lysis crystals were a special digestive crystalline apparatus, generally spheroid in shape. Their name meant 'dissolution' or 'destruction'. These protective crystals were crystalline organelles that flew around the city serving many functions, from hygiene to recycling duties; due to the various tasks they were expected to accomplish they had different shapes and sizes, but shared common characteristics, both esthetically and geometrically; their main purposes were to dissolve or transform damaged or worn out crystals and matter into energy they delivered trough dimensional channels directly to the Omegahedrons, destroy viruses, bacteria or any unwanted organic or inorganic mater. They could fuse whit other crystalline entities to rebuild and change the damaging crystals. Other functions included digesting foreign components (or other forms of waste) that invade the city and help repairing damage to the crystal membrane by serving as a fast patch, sealing the wound in the shield. She cleaned her mind and sighed deeply, looked forward and kept her pace. Entering the residential zone was like entering a fantasy town, whit houses of several sizes and stiles, shapes and functionalities, all molded to suit every families needs and numbers, all notoriously well design and separated: small families had smaller houses for their required lees space and resources, larger ones,had larger houses of course; their were so specialized that even the scientist had specialized micro laboratories in their respective houses, just like the artist had their own private space, workspace and gallery, and so on. Ral's house was a small one; and the reason was as sad as evident for the community; it was somewhat difficult to have secrets in Argo. Ral was the only son for reasons well known around the family circles; his random manifestations of stubbornness and disobedience produced enough fear in her poor parent's hearts to reject the idea of adding a new life into the family. A fear more than justified considering the strict way of her race to deal with criminals or potential criminals. And right now, with her kind slowly recovering their normal liefs after their planets destruction, tat thin tolerance line became even thiner; specially after Zaltar's imprudence. Kara was unsure about how would she handle it. She hesitated again at the door, but then she remembered the Phantom Zone, the dimensional hell she was thrown into once. She remembered her suffering and desperation in that horrible place and her doubts vanished. She called Ral's parents mentally. The door vanished and a elegantly dressed young couple bowed before her. The Savior of Argo returned the kind gesture and requested permission to enter. Ral's father gestured to the athletic blond girl to enter and join them in their family ring. They were expecting her, perhaps the … told them she was coming, and by the looks in their faces she knew they were expecting the worst. Kara sat in the over comfortable gravity chair prepared for her and waited; she wanted to be the first to talk, but couldn't; their tears wouldn't let her. After a tense silence Ral's father courageously spoke. \"This is a very difficult moment for us, Kara. And we understand that Ral did something terrible today, something we wish he had never done; from the bottom of our hearts.\" he stresed, almost sobbing in the process; his eyes became humid. \"But what is done is done, and we...\" her wife rested her crying face on his shoulder \"will accept any decision the academic council takes regarding our son\". His last words barely came out. She couldn't take it anymore; she was crying inside too. \"That is very noble and comprehensive. I simpatize with all your toughs and wanted to said from the beginning that the … gave me complete powers regarding Ral's education from this point on And I have decided to become his … (mentor). \"What?\" Ral's father almost fell of his chair. He could not believe what he was hearing: to become someone's … (mentor) meant literally to risk your future and reputation for someone else (to become someone else's father or mother). Very few kryptonians did that in the past, and more than one went trough a terrible experience for such a decision. Kara was literally risking a lot for his son. \"But Kara...\" Ral's father wanted to thank her, to warn her, to understand her; but didn't now what to do first. \"Why?\" Kara took one of her tears with her left index. \"Because I believe in love. I believe that anyone can change and that Ral can change too. If he needs all my attention and time, then I am more than happy to give it to him. I want him to become the great man Rao wants him to become; if a sacrifice must be done for his future, then I want to do it.\" Ral's mother was literally out of the city, submerged in a deep shock. His father stood up with his face covered in tears and hugged Kara, his wife followed them shortly. Kara allowed the gesture and shared her own tears with his. \"I would like to give Ral the news personally if you allow me.\" Ral's father nodded and hugged her wife thigttly. \"Of course, Kara, we will be more than honored if you do so.\" Ral-Ta was sitting in the floor next to his bed, with his face marked by warm tears. He didn't want to speak to anyone, and had been crying since his arrival. He was just a kid, but even at his young age he knew very well what was expected from him, and the consequences of his fresh disobedience. Now, the weight of his sin was all over him, and he was deeply repented. But he knew very well that it was too late. Kara entered his carefully ornamented room, stood in front of him and waited. Both sets of glassy blue eyes stared at each other, looking for something. Ral's face was defined of sadness and fear, but hers was defined by a soft but encouraging smile. \"Are going to take me to …?\" Kara's throat knotted. She shook her head. \"No, Ral. I came here to tell you how important you are for me, and that I have decided to become your mentor.\" Ral's mouth opened a little as he embraced those marvelous words, a little numb from shock. \"What? Why?\" Kara paused for a brief second and then changed his life forever. \"Because I forgive you, Ral; we all do.\" she extended her hand. \"Please come back with us, everyone is waiting for you, especially me.\" Her smile was powerful and heart touching, her eyes giving away nothing but the truth in those wonderful words. \"Kara!\" Ral jumped up and hugged her muscular legs tightly. Kara sat down with him and hugged him like a mother. Then something she had never expected happened, something wonderful. \"Thank you, Supergirl!\" thanked Ral, with all his heart. Kara froze for a moment as distant memories took her mind far away. The mentioning of a part of her she tough (she would never hear again) was lost (gone) forever awoke powerful feelings in her. \"Where did you hear that word?\" Ral looked for her eyes. \"Your mother told mine once; she said that it was an important name for you. I was close by and I listened. I believed it meant a lot to you...\" He just wanted to homage her savior with something that meant a lot for her. \"Thank you, Ral.\"Kara caressed his hair with pure gratitude; no one had called her that way in years. Kara hugged him maternally one more time and stand up, cradling him in her arms. She laid him down on his bed and asked him to sleep until tomorrow, when she would come to pick him up for a new day. With a swift tough she commanded his bracelet trough hers to render him in deep sleep until the next morning, so he could rest physically and emotionally as well. A brief talk and a promise where all she needed to conclude her visit. Her soul was pumping in joy and she didn't hide it; a beautiful and contagious smile accompanied her all the way out and trough the next walk home. Love and hope had prevailed again. Kara passed trough the marvelous crystalline arches that distinguished her house from all other, the only gift she accepted to keep as the Savior of Argo; as for her, she was only being responsible for her actions. She mentally commanded the door to open and entered home with a large grin plastered on her face. \"Mom, I am home!\" called the gorgeous girl with joy and hope. \"Mom?..\" Kara looked everywhere but she seemed to be the only soul in the house. She tried with her parent's bedroom. \"Mother...\" called again. The room was essentially empty except for a large gravity armchair floating in the air with an elegant and beautiful woman sitting on it; her mother. Alura seemed asleep, but still sitting in a perfect posture, like in a deep meditation. A small shiny morphing crystal that floated a feet above her head was illuminating her body with a cascade of misty light, adding more beauty to the perfect environment. Kara came closer and her smile quickly vanished; her mother's body was sitting in front of her but her mind was far, far away. She was deep inside again; in another reality; a perfect virtual world where krypton still existed and lived as she remembered. The artificial reality was so perfect than many citizens practically lived there constantly, only returning to the real world to participate into specific family and community matters. It all started as a small amusement a year ago, but soon too many became addicted to a noble man's attempt to create a brief escape for his nostalgic spirit. (People nicknamed the addicts, The \"Dreamers\") There was even a formal request from the avid kryptonian group that practically lived in that fantastic krypton to put each and every citizen of Argo in suspended animation after reshaping the city to become a self sustained, fully automatic and evolutive colony. Essentially a giant incubator that will take care of each one's care, including birth and recycle, to allow them and the newcomers to exist into the virtual universe they have created; for the addicts, it was much better than reality, and the place everyone deserved to be. The ruling scientific counsel resolved to study the request and to provide the addicts the means to leave reality if they wanted so only under the condition to return to the real world if the council itself or their family authorities requested so. They agreed, and sadly, her mother was one of them... Alura tried to convince Zor-El and her to join them into the virtual universe, Zor-El refused first, telling his beloved wife that even if the virtual world was as realistic as the real one they have lost, he would always know it wasn't real. And that he preferred to fight for the future instead of escaping reality. Kara was in the middle of a family storm for the first time, both postures had their arguments well based, but even after hearing from her mother that \"My dear, you now that the reality is actually the place where your heart is...\" she was not convinced, somehow, she knew her father was right, and with eyes in tears she turned down her mother's request too. Sadly, Alura didn't resigned to her dream in favor of the normal development of their family life and kept submerging herself regularly into the virtual krypton; each week she passed more and more in there; sometimes even days without interruption. She resisted the impulse to bring her mother back to reality to greet her after thinking it briefly; the last time she did, Alura went mad and they had a very unpleasant argument. She went to her room instead, walking down the short hallway to her bedroom with a melancholic expression; she already had enough problems to deal with and didn't needed to ad her mother's temper to it. She had a happy life, but her hearth also troubled her from time to time with wishes she knew she couldn't make real. Kara entered her room and ordered the over relaxing and stunning VR landscape of a kryptonian dawn to vanish; this one was within one of the most treasured places of her gone world. Her room was a pretty and comfortable kryptonian woman suite with ample space beautiful furniture. She ordered all furniture to melt within the room's ornamented walls and floor except her gravity bed, shaped like a huge ovoid sliced diamond; she sat on it. Her Zaltar's Nexus bracelet commanded the crystal bed and the gravity field to acquire the most comfortable configuration for her, as well as the atmosphere. Kara sighed and lost her eyes and thoughts in the ornamented wall across the room. She had her own dreams; different and often beyond consideration. She concentrated on the beautiful looking wall while gently caressing Zaltar's bracelet. A touch and a wish and the crystalline wall became alive; an intense light dot in the white surface surged and expanded from the inside out as if were a solid wake pushing the wall`s crystal like water, turning the resulting crests into ornamental vines that delightfully enhanced the spectacular view of one of Kara's most beloved treasures; her Supergirl uniform. The tight suit was worn by a crystal statue identical as her; a carefully crafted crystalline reflection of her powerful self from years ago. The majestic symbol of the house of El glowed with a light of its own and the reds and blues of the uniform were shiny and clean, like if the fabric was made of microscopic stars. A wish and the crystalline statue gained life. It walked towards her with natural steps, stopping near her and posing for her. This costume held special meaning for her. The first time she put it on, a magical feeling swept over her. Seeing it again made her heart jump joyfully, her smile arouse beautifully. The day she arrived from earth everyone was speechless, everyone cheered her and named her their savior. Also, everyone thought that her mythical flying powers came from the uncommon, yet hypnotically attractive costume she wore. She never told them, she never needed to; she was back, the Omegahedron was back, Argo City was saved; that was everything that mattered. She continued with her normal life and hid the reality of her powers until she didn't need to anymore; it didn't take long. The first 2 days after her arrival were the most special days; she was constantly receiving gifts and thanks from every citizen, gifts that she gently refused; except the arc in front of their house's entrance. But she enjoyed more her secrets flights in the inner space; those moments were unique… Kara approached the empty probe airlock, quietly and discrete as a soft breeze, floating in the air towards the door to avoid any noise. Inside the chamber, she taped a symbol on the wall that became alive, transforming into many other perfectly enlighten symbols and icons that sprang out and floated around her. The inner door materialized and the decompression began; she smiled innocently, her heart was screaming with excitement. A few more second, and the outer hatch dematerialized, opening her the way to the yet barely explored inner space. Kara took her time, and walked gracefully outside, over the void, like a princess entering her kingdom. Her bracelet communicated her mind that her wish had been granted and her smile arouse; for the city's sentinel conscious she was just one more probe going out on a brief recognizance mission, and nothing else; nothing that could reveal the wonder of a kryptonian doing the impossible. She even took the precaution to go out in the moment were all other probes and recognizance crafts were being evaluated and reformulated. It was pure delight… She was walking over nothing, like stepping over invisible bricks. The magnificent lights and the glow of her home's walls behind her created an iconic environment that, together with the glow of a relatively near storm nebula, produced an enchanting moment. Kara closed her mighty fists and flew forward, straight towards the storming nebula ahead. She reached the uncanny inner space phenomena and smiled delighted. She kept her eyes open and with her marvelous power plunged inside it, diving inside a fresh eruption that could disintegrate an asteroid the size of Australia in a nanosecond. The sensation of submerging into the blast and flying straight to the center of the most powerful singularity of the inner space was unspeakable. She spun, rolled and danced graciously deep inside the singularity, enjoying and laughing about the colossal forces around her that could only amuse her. A moment latter, her curiosity emerged and she couldn't resist the impulse to analyze that energy beast like no one could do it before. Using her superior kryptonian mental abilities she began to decipher and understand the nature and behaviors of the forces bathing her. Satisfied, she relaxed and simply closed her eyes, falling asleep. Kara opened her eyes and stretched among the destructive forces around; it was time to return, for more than obvious reasons she didn't wanted anyone to know. Kara left the nebula and called her Zaltas's Nexus bracelet backup from its dimensional vault. The wrist jewel regenerated itself, carefully following the perfect contour of her left wrist, ornamenting it elegantly. She ordered the intelligent jewel to perform its concealment trick again. The bracelet amazed her yet again and cleverly masked her dimensional signature to hide her from the city's conscious. Zaltar's little present was not just a nice looking bracelet that reacted near a kryptonian power source but a fully functional Nexus bracelet; Zaltar was working together with the team that developed the technology before his imprudence. Kara sighed and closed her eyes; her delicious rides didn't last as much as she wanted: the third time she got outside something terrible almost happened to her. A sensation already forgotten invaded her suddenly, in the middle of her sweet flight, the sensation of being out of air. And if that wasn't bad enough, she felt the sharp coldness of the inner space stinging her body while battling not to lose conscious during her sudden return. She barely made it back and it was scary enough for not to try it again. The deep silence of the main living room was broken by the unmistakable hum of the house's transporter. A well-dressed male figure materialized slowly in a blend of colored swirls; Zor-El. He was one of the most prestigious members of the ruling scientific council in Argo City, Kara's father and brother of the even more famous Jor-El, Kal-El's deceased father. (Zor-El) The brother of Krypton's greatest scientist was experimenting with a new way of transporting matter and energy trough dimensions when the nightmare happened. Memories of his meetings with his deceases brother rained over him from time to time, drowning him in a sea of guilt where there was no island he could rest on. His world's destruction was so contradictory and tragic at the same time. He wasn't sure about his blotters claims; he did several tests himself, and Rao, although an old star, still had several million years ahead. He never believed in him, he couldn't... Who could? But even so…it happened. Just like Jor-El predicted: an impossible catastrophe. That old puzzle still troubled him in his dreams sometimes; how could Jor possibly know that Rao was going to explode? When all and every possible scientific evidence was pointing to the opposite direction! Maybe he had a vision…or something like that. He mourned and prayed in silence to his god, requesting him to tell Jor, wherever he might be, to forgive him for not believing his words. If he only have had more faith in him… Then perhaps both would have found a way to save krypton from the cataclysm. But the best place for the past was in the past itself, so he let it go again. The house's conscience sensed his arrival and saluted him, sharing with him everything he needed to know or requested about his home at a speed only a kryptonian could assimilate. He sensed her daughter's strong emotions and sadness flowing through the family mental ring; she had forgotten to block them with a privacy wall. \"Her mind must have been troubled\" speculated Jor. He went to his dormitory first, knowing his wife was there, following the strict kryptonian family code. Alura was present but only physically; her mind was still in the virtual Krypton. He bowed his head and resigned to ask her to help him with the melancholy of her daughter; after the last time, it was pointless. The scientist turned away from the odd sight of her mind absent wife before him and head towards her daughter's room. The house's conscience already alerted Kara that her father was on his way. She cleared her face from the tears and waited. The crystalline door dissolved and Zor-El entered her dormitory, walking with elegance and softness. He didn't say a word and sat next to her daughter. Zor-El caressed her long smooth hair while staring at the teenage crystalline version of Kara, dressed with the flashy blue and red uniform. \"It is hard to let beautiful things go. Isn't it?\" asked Zor-El, a little awkwardly. Kara nodded, feeling her sadness emerge. Despite her outward discipline and her notable position she was still a normal person. Being raised as a kryptonian had its struggles too; she had learned how to maintain an impeccable appearance like everybody else and to dominate her feelings; but sometimes they wanted to emerge and shout! And right now she was sad, nostalgic and a bit depressed all at once. Glancing at her father, Kara had to fight the desire to ask him to let her visit earth again. But she let it go, like many times before. She knew her place was in Argo, among the survivors of her civilization. Much was expected of everyone. And if there was a still a future for Krypton, then that future laid in her, in all of them. Kara decided not to let her father or herself down; no matter how much she liked the power she had before, no matter the sacrifices she had to do. \"It doesn't really matter, father. There are more important things than my dreams...\" \"Do you miss earth?\" \"Yes and no. It was like living a fairy tale... Like being a mighty princess in a fantasy world full of richness and beauty (beauty and treasures) to discover and enjoy. It became even addictive for me because...there was just so much I could do and see. However, at earth people yell to each other, hurt each other, offend each other, and treat others bad so often... I never heated anyone or anything in my life but there…I learned to hate. And it scares me father. Zor-El reclined her daughter's head on his chest and kissed her shiny golden hair. She opened him her toughs completely. \"Kal's world is the kingdom of contrasts, father; there is unspeakable beauty and goodness, but also so much evil and suffering. In Argo City everyone talks sweet to each other. Our home is always nice and peaceful, and I won't change that for any power in the universe, any feeling or any fantastic world.\" \"You have a very noble heart Kara... Keep it always safe.\" Zorl-El lost his gaze on her uniform again, with hundreds of questions he never asked before. \"For a few days you where the most powerful woman in the universe. How did it feel?\" \"It is indescribable, father. You can accomplish so much...\" \"What about your thoughts?\" \"I was confused at some point and... I must confess you, father, that I was afraid; afraid that it was too much power for me. That I could lose control over and be unworthy or irresponsible with it.\" \"If those where your thoughts, my Kara, then you were in the correct path. We are far from being perfect, even belonging to the most advance living beings in the universe; our limitations can misguide us, and ignorance can destroy us. The only way to stay in the path of perfection is by constantly and wisely question our thoughts and decisions; as well as the principles that rule our lives.\" \"But my questioning can fail me too, father.\" \"That is why we have the word of God to warn and guide us, my dear. Perfection is necessary for any successful development and progress. No life, or system, can be successful built nor rest on imperfection; because if that where the case, sooner or latter those foundations will collapse and the consequent damage may be irreparable. My dear Kara, never rest your confidence neither decide the path of your life based on thoughts or philosophies others then the path of God. Logic is perfect there, and you cannot fail. \"You are right, father; you always are.\" Zor-El laughed a bit. \"Not always, my beloved daughter. Well...\" he caressed his chin a bit \"Maybe 98% of times. What do you think?\" father and daughter smiled contagiously, until a the last long suppressed desire stole most of her recently recovered joy; strong feelings of selfishness washed over her and she felt the urge to let it out of her system; once and for all. \"I became a hero back there; and part of me wanted it to last forever, father. It was so beautiful... But I knew it wouldn't last. Still, I have dreamed many nights with it again.\" she looked deep inside her father's blue eyes. \"Forgive me father. I shouldn't be talking about this; about dreaming to be a hero again. I am so selfish.\" \"That depends, Kara... If you are eager to be a hero for the sake of others then a hero you are, and a hero you should be! Real heroes are the ones who sacrifice themselves for others, the ones who give themselves to others expecting nothing in return. And you sacrificed yourself for all of us when you went trough the unimaginable to retrieve the lost Omegahedron; so you are a hero.\" Kara shook her head. \"Maybe I was a hero back then... But now, it is different; Supergirl is gone. I am not her anymore\" But Zor-El was determined to give her daughter the truth her heart was desperately needing (starving for). \"Why not?\" \"Supergirl was an extremely powerful woman, father. With enough strength to knock planets out of orbit. Now, those powers are gone. I can't help anyone like I did before.\" she gazed down. \"Kara... A hero without powers is a hero nevertheless, just like a musician is a musician with or without his instrument. And even without his tools, a true musician always finds a way to express his art, just like you have expressed your heroism without your powers.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You don't need those extraordinary powers to be a hero, Kara; the truth is that no one needs them. Powers are simply tools, they don't make you a better person or a worst person, they don't make you a hero or a villain; it is your heart that makes you a hero or not. An I can tell you that the moment I saw you fly away in Zaltar's spaceship to retrieve the Omegahedron to take responsibility for your actions, I knew there was a hero in you. And now you have saved Ral's future. Yes, the academy's overseer told me what happen. So, as far as I can see, you are a real hero, my daughter. And I am more than proud to be your father. That suit belongs to you because it is the visible sign, the vivid expression of your heart; the heart of a true superwoman. Please ware it again, for me, for Argo, and for you... \"Father!\" Kara hugged her father as her crystal clear tears illuminated the special moment. She cried in happiness on her father's chest, knowing that his father's words were nothing but the truth. Zorl-El stood up and took his daughters hands, making her stand up too. \"Now come with me, my daughter. There is something important I want you to see.\" Zor-El led Kara to the house's transporter and invited Kara to step on it with him. Rao was long gone in the horizon and the eye catching artificial sky was already dressed with countles of elegant stars, inviting every one of the city's inhabitants to rest for a new day. \"Father, where are we going?\" \"You told me many times that you just love to visit the council's main lab whenever you can. Don't you?\" \"Yes, but...\" \"Well, then allow me to grant you a special visit; just you and me. I promise you will love it!\" \"Are you sure? \"98% of times, my dear.\" Father and daughter shared a warmth hug as their figures vanished slowly in the air. Argo City's core was like a city within a city; elegant and large temples, ruling halls, vast crystalline libraries, art vaults and historical museums where part of it. The science council ruling chamber was within a floating crystalline sphere whose only access was a special teleporter illuminated by a cylindrical pillar of light, that shoot down from the bottom of the sphere, falling like a light waterfall over the impressive device 1 mile below. One level below the ruling chamber was the Smegahedron chamber. A special place with a very special meaning for Kara. It was the first place they visited. Kara asked for permission to hold in her hand a very particular one, nicknamed Selena. Zor-El called the power source and the spinning orb flew from her crystalline nest to the opened hands of Kara. Zorl-El took Kara directly to the center of the core The city's core contained most of the city's data crystals, organized in multiple perpetually growing crystal grove. The data within these crystals were the city's nuclear genome. Among the functions of the core was to maintain data integrity and consistency, also to create and maintain the mechanisms for the data to interact to the various specialized crystals that would be used for different purposes; also to control all of the city's activities by regulating data expression and reproduction. The main structures making up the core were the Nuclear Vault: a double crystal membrane that enclosed the entire nucleus and separated its contents from the city itself and The Crystal Flow: a floating liquid crystal meshwork within the nucleus that added physical support. They arrived to the councils main lab; a true labyrinth of floating holographic data and morphing sections that would turn every being's mind crazy; except the trained mind of one of krypton's greatest scientists, Zor-El. Zor-El started to play with the flying symbols, icons and object in a away only he could understand. \"I have a surprise Kara. Something the science council had been working on for a while; something for everyone.\" exclaimed the scientist, smiling all the way. He touched a holographic icon and waited. \"Brace yourself, my beloved daughter.\" The crystalline floor at the center of the room opened like a blossoming flower. Enchanting tones resounded across the room as one of the councils vaults opened and revealed a tiny shiny crystal that slowly floated upwards and froze a yard above the ground. She knew what it was, a fundamental solar crystal; but for what purpose? Could... could it be? Zor-El reshaped the symbol in his hands and the crystal started to shine brighter and brighter, until exploded in an orchestra of sounds, colors and forms, showing a future taste of a yet not mature reality. A brilliant kryptonian sunrise blasted the unusually clear horizon in an explosion of colors revealing one of their home planet's unforgettable landscapes. Kara couldn't hold back her tears and neither her father. They were standing over one of her most beloved places of her destroyed home, the road of the thousand temples; a valley among breath taking mountain peaks where silver-crystalline roads led to thousand magnificently beautiful temples that spread trough the most famous mountain chain in Krypton. It was summer, so there where flowers and some alien looking vegetation blossoming in carefully crafted niches at the sides and within the road. Zor-El hugged her shivering Daughter as both opened their hearths to each other. He cried in silence holding her close to him, feeling her warm heart. \"It is not completely ready, and we estimate one o two more cycles before Krypton II can start growing. It will be exactly as before, our home, where we belong!\" She looked at her father eyes with her glassy ones, her cheeks were soaked in tears. Zorl-El took her daughter's tears without worrying about his own. And turned to delight himself again with the still imaginary kryptonian sunset; where tears met with old dreams that where going to become true very soon. \"I can't believe it, father! How did you...?\" \"With a lot of time and love, Kara; the key for many things.\" He smiled again at his daughter's angelical face and turned towards the sunset, to let the red light bath his elegant features. \"The crystal is in its final stages of gestation right now. And tomorrow, the council will make it public. A present for all kryptonians. He hugged her tightly. \"A new home; like the one we lost. And this time we will be staying here, in inner space, away from the madness and the chaos of normal space. Our artificial sun will be accordingly augmented and carefully controlled, so that no tragedy ever reaches us again. We may even rebuild our entire solar system if we want... There will be a new future for us, my Daughter. Instead of wandering through the universe to accumulate knowledge, we will be the artists of a new universe inside the limitless vastness of the inner space; we will craft planets, moons, nebulas, galaxies... So that one day, when we are gone, they become the homes and sanctuaries of those that will come after us. \"It is such a blessing...\" she bowed her head slightly. \"It is so sad that where are the only ones that will enjoy this present and not all krypton...\" Zor-El remembered his lost beloved brothers and sisters briefly, and with a gesture, terminated the virtual reality simulation. The fundamental crystal that showed his still developing treasures descended to the vault again, where it continued to sleep and grow. The vault closed. \"It is a strange moment we are living in, Kara. There are sad memories and shines of new futures everywhere, all competing to win our hearts. \"Which one do you think will win, father?\" \"The one we feed most, Kara.\" Karas eyes shined with new hope; there was a way to get her mother out of the virtual world, to save Ral's future. To give everyone…a new tomorrow.[Chapter 4] Lost Paradise The sun was high in earth 's sky, a mist of colored petals from small flowers flew everywhere around, and the near beauty of the majestic mountainous landscape filled the world. Kara smiled with her eyes closed and softly tilted her head to fully feel the soft touch of the warm masculine hand that gently caressed her face. She kissed the hand and opened her bright sapphire eyes to fill them with the handsome face of her true love; but something was different, it was not the face of the human she knew to love called Ethan. Still, she didn't care. She moved her face closed to his' and merged her sweet pink lips with his lips in an unforgettable kiss. Kara opened her eyes abruptly, returning fast from dreamland. She touched her exited lips tenderly. That powerful love feeling was still there, and not only in her lips but in her entire body too, burning in an eternal fire. It was pure love! She had been in love before, but she never felt it this strong… Actually, she never felt anything like this before… And she wanted more, much more. She was shivering, she wanted him; she wanted the man that made her feel it. But…who was he? The strange part was that she never saw him before, and he was definitely not kryptonian, for Kara knew every single man in Argo and none of them had his features. And the curious part was that he wasn't Ethan. Ethan... It was very strange, but the feelings and the passion where over the top; it was so beautiful, so addictive, that Kara believed with all her hearth that it could only be a good omen. \"Yes...\" Kara sat up, her sleeping robe started to morph into her regular home clothing, following her mental command. \"This will be a day to remember. A day that will remain in the history of new Krypton forever!\" she concluded with a marvelous smile. A floating holographic mirror formed before her. Kara commanded it to become a full size mirror, no, even a larger one. When she was satisfied with the size of her reflection she called the statue holding her beloved Supergirl uniform. Kara ordered the living statue to morph into a new form and it reshaped like intelligent water. The statue became an alien makeup kit where the uniform melted like liquid honey; each different part of it entered a separated bubble carefully placed into opened flower buds that formed a crystalline floating flower ornament. She commanded her current footwear to melt away and to levitate to a colored crystal mosaic at the left wall; her regular clothing wardrobe. Kryptonian wardrobes were like makeup kits where the user could mix the different kinds of clothing crystals available and play with its atomic structures to produce the desired colors, textures and shapes; it even allowed the creation of new clothing material, designs and types. The liquefied footwear found its place in the mosaic and turned into a symbol shaped crystal, entering a deep sleep until her future call. Kara turned her attention to the floating wardrobe before her and touched the bubble containing the uniform's boots delicately. She watched as the red shinny liquid moved around her forefinger like intelligent living jelly. She smiled. \"A little shinier uniform would be perfect for the first of all the bright days of New Krypton…\" announced the kryptonian girl, while playing with the liquid in her fingers. With that said, the red matter on her finger and the rest in all other bubbles became shinier, as if the small stars that were submerged on it multiplied according to her desires. Then, she applied the red jelly in her fingers into her right knee and watched amused as the liquid started to cover it completely while transforming into her Supergirl's uniform modified right boot. Satisfied with the shinier look she mentally commanded the rest of her uniform to join her again. The renewed liquid uniform distributed in each bubble turned to vapor that flew and surrounded her like a supernatural rainbow cloud. Kara let the joyful sensation overwhelm her and moved graciously in a slow kryptonian dance while her vaporous uniform solidified over her and her dayly clothes vaporized and turned into another small colored cloud that rested peacefully in her palm. She blew the cloud softly and it traveled to its place; at the wall's wardrobe. Kara closed her eyes for a moment and breathed deeply, allowing the wonderful sensation to overwhelm her. She moved her fingers across the marvelous frictionless tissue covering her left forearm; the kryptonian intelligent tissue had adapted perfectly to her new body size and condition to fit perfectly, just like the last time. She took another deep breath, curved her shiny pink lips beautifully, and exhaled slowly while accompanying the soft blow of pure air with her opening eyes; It felt like she had regained a part of her that had been lost. She looked in the mirror and was amazed by the image that looked back. She realized again how much she had changed. She was no longer a cute eh|dhyv but a real e}Dyv now. From an slender and athletic girl to a gorgeous 6 foot 2 big girl, 140 pounds, long wavy and flaming gold blond hair more intense in color than before, like true solar flames. Her face hoever, was as angelic as always, retaining her adolescent beauty. The gorgeousness of her young body was at full display. Her strong curvy torso was clad in a skintight blue body suit shining as if was made of countless miniaturized stars. Her hips and upper thighs were covered by a short ruby red mini skirt; her feet and tick calves by glossy red boots. A long scarlet cape hung off of her shoulders which were now pulled back, accentuating her perfect breasts sticking out proudly from behind the renowned \"S\" logo. The moment was almost perfect, but something was missing… She issued another mental command through her nexus bracelet and her room produced many holograms created from her memories of earth: trees, flowers, water, singing birds and a heart touching breeze combined perfectly in a dream garden of unmatched splendor. The virtual garden that suddenly surrounded her was so real that they even had controlled substance. She smiled and danced among the fully blossomed flowers; a human looking alien ballerina living her fantasy in a fantastic world. She was so immersed in her stunning dream that she didn't even notice her father entering her room. \"Earth is an incredibly beautiful World, Kara… Their God has surely blessed them very much… Kara was slightly startled by her father's unexpected presence and stopped her dancing. She smiled back at her father's loving smile. \"But our god has blessed us to, Father. I can see his blessings right here.\" She hugged him warmly. Zorl-El returned the hug and caressed her daughters' long wavy hair. \"I wish I could have your heart my dear… Sometimes it is difficult for me to understand Rao's love.\" \"Look father…\" She called his elegant deep blue eyes with hers. \"We are together. Isn't that Rao's greatest blessing? Outside our city the evil still coexists among the goodness in the normal universe, and we are safe from that evil here. Rao allowed our former home to perish but gave us a safer one instead. Isn't that a great blessing?\" He touched her daughter's features tenderly; she looked so much like him… \"I think you are right, my daughter. And also that everyone in Argo deserves to treasure that truth also. Come; let us begin this glorious day.\" Father and daughter entered the main living room and sat in their correspondent chairs in the center; the morning knowledge ring was about to begin. Kara saw her beautiful mother's empty crystal gravity chair and sighed briefly; it has been a long time sense she had joined them for one of the best moments of their advance culture. Their eyes closed and flow of soft light rose from the chairs and their bodies. Kara giggled joyfully as the endless flow of information and sensations flooded her mind; the kryptonian morning ring was the moment where each and every kryptonian shared their last findings, teachings, lessons, experiences and knowledge. While at earth people were teach to compete against each other to progress, the kryptonian way of progress was entirely based on cooperation instead of competition; everyone shared everything with everyone, thus achieving mutual progress; in this way every kryptonian would grow wiser and smarter, and would be able to overcome his/her own limitations for everyone's benefit. Kara opened her eyes and her father stretched a bit. He went to the transporter pad and saluted her daughter while vanishing within the light dance, traveling trough dimensions to the Science Council's lab. She collected all necessary data for today's lesson and walked outside. The day was wonderful… Every day there was another perfect mirage of the missed glory of krypton, the gone home world no one wanted ever to forget, the canyons of Shrikell where now bordering the residential area, with its 8000 km deep abyss, bristling with hundreds of waterfalls and summer cities that looked suspended in the magnificent and bright crystalline groves and fertile flower gardens contrasting the natural beauty of the crystalline formations all around. Kara walked with pride and grace, joyfully smiling back at the sometimes astonished eyes of her fellow kryptonians that watched her well known top form now dressed with \"The Miraculous Suit\" as many of them proclaimed back then. She arrived at Ral's home in no time and picked him up under the bulged eyes of his parents. Ral, by the contrary, enjoyed the look of his personal mentor with more joy that he was able to express; walking at her side with his head up, holding the hand of the \"Savior of Argo\" with pride and enjoying the somewhat perplexes gazes of the his fellow citizens even more than Kara was. Kara took a small detour that took them close to the perimeter of the city; near the same place the Omegahedron was lost the first time. The whole mall was different now; the Cristal shield that contained the city's atmosphere was much more advance and strong than the old version; protecting the small metropolis and its content from casual dispersion and allowing control over the inner environment of the city by avoiding external unwanted matter or energy. It also determined what could enter and leave the city in specific locations; it also detected and bonded specific molecules and atoms so it could get them outside or inside through specific systems. The crystal membrane could also allow the entrance of certain compounds for specific studies; encapsulating them in its crystalline structures at the same time the objects were pushed inside the city. \"Are we going somewhere else, Kara?\" The girl in the super suit smiled \"No, Ral. I just wanted to remember a little bit. We will be in our way soon.\" Without warning a loud bang resounded across the city walls. A large, refrigerator sized, egg shaped purple fireball blasted through the crystal shield, and the kryptonian sky illusion, and impaled itself on the street not too far from Kara, shooting a rain of debris above and around. The new intelligent crystal shield closed immediately after the objects penetration and instantly compensated for any atmospheric loose or alteration. The citizens ducked immediately with the thunderous impact and only raised their heads when the city's perpetual calm seemed to return. What they saw, partially sunken in a molten crystalline crater at the center of the street near the edge was the strangest thing they had ever seen. \"Kara, what's going on?\" \"I am not sure, Ral. Just stay close to me.\" Two young scientists dressed with regular lab robes where the closest to the impact zone and the first ones to approach the strange pulsing egg; their natural kryptonian curiosity had taken over. One was more eager than the other. Don-Ta extended his left palm towards it, approaching his nexus bracelet to the mutalink egg to almost touch it, while his best friend kept his distance. \"Runo, are you analyzing this? It's amazing!\" \"I think we should not approach it until the Cicer Crystals encapsulate it, Don.\" The Cicers were small crystal bubbles with stasis gel for transportation of wounded citizens or living specimens, used when the crystal transporters where inoperable or could not be used. Cicers formed naturally because of the properties of kryptonian organic solar crystals; however most Cicers have specialized functions depending on what materials they contain or carry. Because Cicers tend to look alike, it is very difficult to tell the difference between different types of Cicers without sampling their contents. Cicers, however, were used mainly for storage and transport of materials within Argo. \"They will do it in no time. But right now we should scan it as much as we can. See the light and the pulsing pattern? I could almost feel it is organic, but the readings I receive are... Confusing, even contradictory. What about yours?\" \"I am not taking any!\" \"Don't let fear stop you.\" \"What about prudence?\" \"This is a unique opportunity, Don.\" He turned around his head to encourage his friend with his shiny eyes, bulging from curiosity. \"Com one, my friend, lets unveil this marvelous phenomena first hand.\" He never could. A nightmarish head blasted from the purple pulsing surface and attacked his hand with the speed and swiftness of a snake. Glittering translucent mandibles full of resin bite the curious forearm, gripping it strongly before returning inside the egg with the whole arm of his victim. Don-Ta's shock was so intense that it shadowed the huge pain his limb was experiencing inside the mysterious egg. He struggled and screamed until his arm was released. He pulled it out fast, groaning in pain all the way. His limb was severally burned and deformed; like a dried grapefruit. His legs went numb and he fell on his knees, breathing heavily, seizing his distorted arm with his right hand. His face was pale as paper. His nexus bracelet acted immediately, subjugating his master's pain and starting to reconstruct his severally hurt arm. \"By Rao!\" Runo-Ur back paced without a second though while his friend was collapsing. \"Don, get out of there!\" But he couldn't, the shock and pain combination was too much for him. All nearby citizens that witnessed the macabre attack where either paralyzed from the impression or running away as far as possible from the mysterious object. The egg's pulsations increased dramatically until it exploded in a terrifying organic blast, spiting waves of a strange humid purple mist and gelatinous rests; the creature that emerged from it, was as horrible as impressive; a 12 feet long combination between a lizard and an ant, with a purple translucent exosqueleton that allowed everyone to see its internal constitution partially. The creature's head was repulsive, with 4 glowing yellow eyes that send a message of fear to all who witnessed tem. Runo-Ur froze at the sight of it, paralyzed by the most pure fear he had ever experienced. He had never been terrified before; no one had since the destruction of krypton. The creature walked forward slowly, towards the paralyzed kryptonian. Ral screamed at the sight of it. The creature turned his head and fixed his venomous eyes on the kriptonian kid, hissing at him slowly. Ral and Kara withdrew a few feet and the creature charged at them. Panicked, Kara ran from the monster, holding Ral firmly, but their speed where no match for it and the beast leaped one, two, three times to cut the distance between them and jumped high over both, opening his monstrous mound. Ral was constantly turning back in desperation, and he saw the inevitable attack. With every ounce of strength he had he pushed his strong mentor aside, far enough from the creature's mandibles, a heartbeat before the attack. Kara stumbled and rolled over but quickly managed to get up again, just in time to see the monster eat Rall up to his waist and raise his slim frame upwards to swallow him completely. Kara's mind froze in shock, for one second, and then an indescribable transformation occurred inside her mind and spirit, as if some kind of alternate conscious took complete control over her. Her aqua blue eyes blazed savagely in the most pure fury anyone could conceive, her angelical face was now the face of an enraged angel. She screamed, and charged towards the strange monster still devouring Ral. The creature clearly sensed the treat but decided not to bother about it, but Kara didn't attacked him as it expected; she caught the beast by the neck and applied pressure like a nutcracker, with all the power her muscular arms could deliver, desperately fighting to prevent the creature to swallow Ral completely; hoping to force it to spit him out. The beast fought the choke fiercely, while the strongest arms in Argo struggled boldly for Ral's life with a might born deep inside Kara's heart. But even a bear hug powerful enough to crush a full sized bison's ribcage was not enough... The mutalink growled, more annoyed than angered by Kara's brave but useless struggle to save his victim, and jerked his head and neck violently in a wiping motion, snapping her of instantaneously. Even Kara's mighty grip was clearly not enough against the raw power of the mutalink and embraced the air. The kryptonian girl landed in the floor roughly and rolled several feet before her gymnastic instincts took over and brought her to her feet again in a beautiful flip over a single hand stand. Now Kara could do nothing but watch has the horrific translucent beast finished swallowing the helpless Ral and transformed itself in an egg shaped cocoon a few seconds later. Val was visibly struggling inside, each second lees and lees. Kara clenched her fists strong enough to burst tennis balls. She revealed her perfect teeth fiercely and charged towards the bizarre cocoon like a mother defending is son. She watched Val diving slowly into unconsciousness until she could not stare at it anymore. She viciously hammered the cocoon with her fists, ignoring the pain. Val shivered one last time and froze suddenly. Kara yelled at him, opened her palms and hit the bizarre surface of the cocoon with all her strength, hoping vainly to awake his protégé; to bring him back to consciousness, or back from the death, but she only provoked an even greater pain for herself. Kara cried loud as an incredibly sharp pain attacked her hands; energy covered spikes surged violently all over the cocoon, like a natural defense mechanism, impaling her opened palms in the moment they were hitting the surface. Thick blue blood splattered on Kara's face and stained her hands and the floor below. Kara shut her eyes tight, blinded by a pain she had never experienced before, as if her hands were impaled on red hot needless. She clenched her teeth and screamed at the same time, while pulling her hands out of the needle wall. Kara yelped in more pain when she finally released her hands. She fell on her knees, conquered by a seemingly never stopping and burning pain. She watched her blood stained hands shake uncontrollably until Zaltar's nexus bracelet finally subjugated the pain and started closing the blood covered holes in her hands. She thanked Rao for this technology; it was not only healing her bruises and wounds but also eliminating the poison o whatever those spines injected her system with. She stared at the cocoon again; there was nothing she could do; if she was going to try to rescue Val she needed help, lots of help. She called for help and alerted her father trough the mental channel when the real nightmare began. A rain of mutalink eggs shoot trough the city's perimeter shielded dome like artillery shells; severally damaging everything they hit on impact. The attack of the Ranam Cult had begun. Panicked and sunken in deep chaos, the citizens from the last Kryptonian city ran for shelter and protection as best as they could, looking desperately for a way out of the reach of the terrible creatures that emerged shortly after each egg's impact. The monsters where just like the first one, a few ones had minor differences in color and exoesqueletal ornamentation. Kara ran from the mutalink egg shower like a gazelle in the middle of a meteor shower. The spawning monsters where frenetically attacking and swallowing everyone they caught, in one piece, turning themselves into cocoons identical to the first's one, with their victims imprisoned inside for some unknown purpose. She forgot about everything and everyone in that instant, and focused in one of the many temples of the city that lied ahead. More bizarre screams resounded behind her. She turned around just one second and quickly resumed her run. Dozens of creatures ran through the abandoned city mall, looking for more victims in a thundering stampede. Close to her, the huge doors of the temple where already starting to close like a human iris. She hurried up, demanding her solid leg muscles all the speed they could deliver, and hoped she could make it before the small crowd at the other side of the door sealed it completely. Kara heard quick steps behind her; the creatures where faster than her, a lot faster. She summoned hall her reserves and forced her body to the limit, running like she never did before, praying for the people at the other side of the slowly closing door to help her somehow. Her hopes were answered when a fast low flying Cicer Crystal speeded towards her. Kara measured the time and jumped beautifully, fractions before the crystal rammed her, sliding her fingers gracefully over its frictionless surface. The crystalline improvised projectile collided against her pursuer like a missile, consuming itself and its prey in a resounding explosion of light and power waves that danced in the air. Kara made one, two, three short jumps, and jumped forward as fast and high as she could; stretching her body like a diver passing through the closing iris in a blink. The crystalline doors sealed completely and the scared kriptonians at the other side caught Kara in her fall. Kara was deposited gently in the floor; she sat down slowly conquered by exhaustion, fear and despair. The crowd started to calm down, partially relieved, and started to make the questions no one asked or answered until then. \"Ral…\" whispered Kara with closed eyes. Tears began swelling up at the thought that she had lost him forever. Nim-Ur, the eldest of the group trapped inside the sealed temple stood up and checked every survivor of the attack with bulged eyes. \"By the glory of Rao! What are those things?\" \"I don't know, Nim, but whatever they are they seem eager to consume large organic life forms like ourselves!\" \"Maybe they are an inner space indigenous life form we have never encountered before, and are attacking us to defend their territory!\" speculated another survivor, desperately seeking for an answer and a solution. \"Imposible!\" retorted Nim \"We have explored and deeply analyzed several thousand light years around us; that makes no sense, we should have encountered them long time ago! Why would a creature like that...? Wait...\" Nim stopped his brother's and sister's imminent words with a gesture; another missing peace took place, a crucial one. \"Why did the city's sensor aura didn't warn us of their approach?\" There was a moment of tense silence after that question. The city's senses where so powerful and advance they could even perceive permeations around and within distinct dimensions, and even collect data from thousand light years around their city. \"Good question, It should have, unless…\" A strident bang shook the large circular crystalline door separating them from the unknown terror behind. Van-Or touched the thick crystal and ordered its intelligent matrix to reconfigure itself to become stronger and thicker. More loud blows resounded \"This could be an attack...\" We are under attack!\" \"That is absurd! We are kryptonians, we have no enemies! \"Now we do...\" Kara massaged her perfectly healthy palms as if the pain and the wounds were still there, while barely lifting her head, and merging her terrified face with her brother's and sister's, feeling more than anyone else the weight of her own words. \"All right…\" Nim looked at everyone in the eyes \"Right now we must recover as much serenity as we can, and we need to...\" A thunderous shock wave echoed through the tick door as if it were a drum membrane. The wave pushed the already frightened group of kryptonians away from the beautiful polished surface, forcing them backwards. A scar ran through the polished door and cicatrized equally fast. Van-Or almost jumped to the door and ironed his palm against the frictionless surface, commanding the sealing crystal to reconfigure to become stronger and thicker. The door started to change following Van's commands, evolving visibly into a darker, heavier and sturdier version of her former self. But even with that power in his hands Van knew it wasn't enough and that their shiny hope would soon be broken; the data flowing from his bracelet to his mind was conclusive and unfortunately accurate. \"Run! They will get trough! Get to the core! Our advance crystals could…\" A dense ray of pure incandescent purple liquid energy drilled furiously trough the heavy crystal door, and straight trough Van's hand. Hearts drowned in terror as every eye turned away from the intense glow of the passing beam. Van's nexus bracelet resisted the power that went through it, and fell to the ground, resounding delicately. Everyone ran without looking back, to the praying chamber, hoping they could reach the safety of the city's reinforced core before death reaches them. With one last act of bravery Van-Or took his fallen bracelet and ordered the structure of the ceiling to separate into many loosen layers and fall behind the running group ahead, as well as the crystals of the floor to grow upwards as pillars; blocking the path of the monsters that where consuming the doors of the temple with their energy breaths. He stood up proudly; his nexus bracelet liquefied, traveled and reshaped itself into his right wrist, and started to heal and restore his consumed hand. One of the creatures jumped inside the small improvised cave. He closed his eyes. The mutalink attacked him without delay and swallowed his body in one piece, morphing into a cocoon shortly afterwards. The group reached the praying chamber swiftly; the door was promptly sealed and reinforced. But time was everything they didn't have, and they attackers seemed to have everything on their favor. In the middle of their desperation they hear familiar voices and begs flooding the collective conscious of the city. Everyone closed their eyes. As their minds meld with the city's a wave of paralyzing fear and indescribable terror flooded the heart of each one. The images they were witnessing could only belong to the worst nightmare; in that instant more than one wished he or her had perished with their long ago destroyed world. Every one heard and saw the desperation and the screams of his brothers and sisters. Sharp screams of fear, pain and terror blend together in the horrific spectacle; it was not just the perimeter: the monsters had invaded the entire city! The creatures where attacking everyone; men, women and children without hesitation or apparent reason; transforming their dream city into a creepy garden of semitransparent cocoons with their victims inside. As panic overwhelmed the survivors inside the praying chamber, the words of his fallen brother echoed in their minds: \"Get to the core!\" Some of them where frenetically thinking in a way to achieve that feat facing a crude reality: the nearest transporters where all resting in the middle of the park behind the temple, where a heard of those monsters already cocooned the people in it. The situation was overwhelming and the unknown creatures seemed to be already everywhere. Their purpose was also unknown, as well as their goal or origin. \"They could be feeding from us!\" cried one of them in desperation. Everything about them was a scaring mystery. Where did they come from? How did they find them? Where they perhaps some native inner space life forms? The nexus bracelets gave the survivors tons of apparently contradictory information about those creatures, as if they were natural and artificial at the same time. But they had studied the inner space deeply for many years and never found anything like that, not even clues about something alive anywhere near or far away from Argo. But then again, inner space was as infinite as normal space, and when that number steps into the equation anything was possible. Still… if they could manage to stand their ground, to shield themselves in the core, then perhaps the creatures would leave or end their feeding cycle and then they may have a chance to survive. Destiny seamed to play a cruel joke with their kind again. Kara prayed loud to her god in her heart, begging for answers, help and mercy, peace and a safe life. Had the children of Rao disobeyed their maker? Did they deserve this? They always did what they have been told to, and the ones who do not where living an eternal hell in the phantom zone; as they deserved it. They were not like the inhabitants of earth who seemed to enjoy disobeying their god and local authorities; the vast majority at least... And even so were blessed so much more than they deserved. Mina An-Dor lost all hope and fell to the ground. Lun-Ta fell at her side and hugged her beloved wife; merging his fearful heart with hers, embracing the same path \"This is fate... It is our fate! We should have never survived our beloved Krypton. It has always been the decision of Rao…\" she spoke, in the name of her heart. Kryptonians where a proud race, obedient to the last, pacific to the extreme, intelligent as few others. \"Mina as spoken the truth! Why don't we open our eyes? There is no more greatness waiting for us in the confines of time. No eternal peace, infinite enlightenment or an idyllic future for us in this universe. It is time... Time to accept our extinction and become one with Rao. Time to leave this twisted universe and embrace the eternal pace at Rao's side. I say, that if our time has come, we must face it as true kriptonians, let's accept our destiny and departure from this life with pride and happiness!\" Kara couldn't believe those words, she had to do something; she had to say something. \"How can we know for sure that this is Rao's will or doing? We were saved from the destruction of our home world by a practically nonexistent margin! If Rao didn't saved us back there then who did? And if he did, I refuse to believe it is his will to turn us to these creatures!\" Nim-Ur nodded; proud of the strong will and the heart of Zor-El's daughter. \"Kara is right! We must defend ourselves and find a way out! Survival is part of nature, if we must defend ourselves to claim our place in the universe then so be it! Who is with me? Everyone stood up or approached Nim, allowing their actions to speak louder than any word in that dark our. Everyone except two… \"We are sorry... As for me and my wife, we will accept what Rao's providence has for us. Farewell our beloved brothers and sisters. Rest assure that you memory will always live in our hearts!\" \"Yours too.\" Nim bowed before the couple, and turned to the brave daughter of Zor-El. \"Kara...\" called the elder kryptonian \"You are the strongest in the group and have gone where no one of us has ever gone before and returned victoriously! I trust your courage and skills as much as Rao's power. Would you lead us?\" Despite those encouraging words Kara's fear took control. \"Forgive me, Nim, but I am no leader. I...I can't.\" She lied. She wanted to help, she wanted to give her best and even her own life for the sake of every one in Argo, but the fear of losing someone again under her wing was stronger than her. She lost her gaze on the impeccable crystalline floor. Nim-Ur prayed shortly, in silence, and took the lead. He concentrated and reviewed the situation like witnessing live episodes of the past; measuring their possibilities and looking for a strategy. He focused on the cicer and the other service crystals, still flying around freely, still fulfilling their duties in the attacked city. He narrowed his eyes and a faint triumphant smile arose. \"By Rao! Of course! Listen, listen everyone! The service crystals and our other labor crystals are still active and are being completely ignored by those creatures!\" \"How can that help us?\" \"We will do the same thing we did to help Kara at the entrance, but in a much larger scale! We can fuse our minds with them and command them to ram the creatures or block them! Like a swarm of angry kryptonian squarks!\" \"Yes...\" Kara raised her angelical face; her shiny blue eyes glowed with new hope. \"We could even modify them to counter the invaders!\" \"We may not have enough time for that, but we should keep that on mind too. Let's go!\" The mutalinks roared and waited, as hungry tigers waiting for they prey to fall in their trap, moving softly and menacing all around the majestically beautiful and great alien park, unaware of the hidden improvisation that was ready to attack them; as ghosts lurking in the shadows. One soft tone, delicate and charming, resounded from the temple's back door. The crystal that formed the barrier diminished wonderfully, inverting its amazing growth, revealing a small group of humble and resolved kryptonians determined to fight for their lives and freedom, or die trying... Nim-Ur walked forward, with his eyes fixed on the monstrous being growling in front of him, 40 yards away. The mutalink leading the pack hesitated a few moments; his targets had abruptly modified they behavior pattern, too much. Something had changed… The cult's living weapon scanned his environment quickly and ordered his brothers to do the same. There was an invisible and inaudible answer that echoed within all of them. Without warning the pack leader jumped towards Nim-Ur, so fast and so powerfully, than it was impossible for him to escape or fight his destiny. Or wasn't it? Nim-Ur drew a sweat smirk from deep within his heart. An eye blink before the fierce mutalink touched him a glowing crystalline meteor rammed the falling beast like a bullet train, with deadly accuracy. The impact resounded fiercely in the air, and the most bizarre shriek ever heard, escaped from the badly hurt monster. Nim's smirk changed to a battle hardened face and a brave cry escaped his lips. \"Nooow!\" Every one ran for their lives, for the only possible way out: the transporters. Nim-Ur's and Val-Zar's crystals began to ram, push and ultimately to smash themselves on the confused mutaliks so violently that there was little else remaining from the impact afterwards. The beasts clearly never saw them even as a potential threat, not even minimally; but who would? In a flash of motion, two mutalinks darted towards the fleeing crowd while another two bolted towards Kara from the other side in a pincer movement. Kara felt her tension level skyrocket at the sight of it and quickly commanded 8 crystals to spin around her rapidly, forming an intelligent circular defensive perimeter that effectively hammered every mutalink that tried to catch her or got to close; like meteoric boxing punches; hitting the mutalinks sometimes like rounds of a machine gun, other times like lighting fast jabs, body blows, and finally uppercuts. The daughter of Zor-El moved graciously and smiled; some confidence had gained ground in her heart, reinvigorating her, making her stronger. She was now protected as if by a circle of invisible giant boxers whose punches where the only thing the monsters could see. It was working! Some of the group's attacks were more refined than others, but even the simplest barriers where holding the creatures back or sending them into oblivion. They were going to make it; each and every one of them. Nim-Ur shouted the group to form a diamond shaped formation in order to cover all flanks and to advance relentlessly towards their now close goal: a group of 4 transporters aligned close to a small lagoon. They would need to hold the mutaliks in check a while before all could escape, but given the new odds…that would be no problem. Kara took the rear and tightened her spinning barrier around her. The group became confident, but the battle was far from over. \"Don't let them attack our rear! Once we reach the transporters we will jump in groups of four. Kara, you are doing superbly well! I need you to stay with the last group to be sure. \"Look!\" Nim-Ur saw what confirmed their suspicions even more. The mutalinks stopped charging them and divided into groups that tactically blocked their way to every transporter pad; how could a beast know what that technology was meant for? \"This is surreal...\" babbled Val-Zar. There where two possibilities but only one correct answer, and the gifted minds of every kriptonian in there shouted it loudly: someone was directing those beasts, someone far more intelligent, and with a completely unknown goal in mind. Kara looked all around, trying to find the leader responsible for the creature's tactics and organization with the help of her Nexus bracelet; she couldn't find one. However, who was directing their attack must have a special mental link with this creatures; one she needed to find and block. \"Nim, I am trying to determine the mental channel these creatures are using to communicate among themselves and their leader, but haven't find any so far. How about you?\" \"Nothing...\" Stated Nim between his clenched teeth, without letting his guard down. \"And we may not have enough time right now to discover and cut it, so I suggest we focus on getting to safety. There will be time for that later\". \"Yes, you are right\". The creatures had been completely surprised by the kryptonians smart improvisation, but the joy of the brave defenders didn't last long. The mutalinks had perceived the defenders tactics and switched their own, surprising them in return. The monsters regrouped at a safe distance from the victim's improvised defensive satellites, forming a tight wall between the fleeing kryptonians and their goal. Nim-Ur squinted his eyes fearfully and stopped his run; the small caravan of hope behind him broke their advance as well, carefully holding the defensive line and their positions. The game had changed. \"What are they doing…?\" \"I am not sure.\" The mutalink leader examined the shocked faces of his victims carefully; their expressions gave him all the information he needed. The commanding beast turned around to examine the curiously beautiful disk shaped device behind him that the humanoids where so eager to reach. It scanned it deliberately, roaring all the way, and then attacked the device wildly like a starving lion. Nim-Ur panicked and charged towards the mutalink line like a mad bull, shouting as loud as he could. \"They are going to destroy the transporters! Take them down now!\" Nim released roar so impressive and mighty that surprised even the brave men and women at his command. He instructed all his improvised orbiting weapons to dart towards the mutalinks guarding the teleporters in front of him and to hit them in pairs; as to squash as many beasts as possible with a speed and pattern that would be impossible for them to avoid or whistand. All mutalinks in front of him hissed and roared at the same time; with enough time before the impact they combined themselves in groups of three; like jelly made creatures melting together, turning into a bizarre luminous pool that splashed against the ground and avoiding the mighty kryptonian projectiles. The small lagoons emitted a series of tones and strange luminous patterns and started to inflate; as if someone inside where blowing the gelatinous mass up; turning it into a rare resinous and flickering balloon. Nim-Ur couldn't stop his amazement, but neither his run; determined and angered, her retrieved his protecting crystals and grouped them closer together; preparing them for his enemy's next move. If he only knew... The gelatinous multicolored balloons grew as big as elephants and exploded away their deadly new warriors when the kriptonians where near enough; hundreds of smaller flying mutalinks, mutated accordingly to counter their foe's defenses. Nim-Ur went wild at the sight of the horrendous swarm that engulfed him alive like carnivore wasps, he tried desperately to make the crystalline defense around him to get rid of them; it would have worked with bigger, more massive foes, but not against creatures so small... Even when dozens of mutalinks where mercilessly destroyed by the know larger defensive crystals, more than enough could avoid the rapid spinning barrier and attack him effectively like a furious swarm. In a second, Nim was covered by thousands of small mutalinks that brought him to his knees in the middle of a horrible screams of agony so terrible and fearful, than all other kryptonians stooped death in their tracks, shocked. Nim-Ur was covered with small mutalink insects that appeared to have eaten him alive. A second later the insects formed the same kind of cocoon like the bigger ones produced. Nim was inside, floating like if trapped in an blue greenish egg, possibly death and with his barely visible body covered with terrible wounds. The other balloons exploded as well, liberating their nightmare, unleashing a furious swarm at the now shocked kryptonians. The scene that followed the new mutalink attack was as horrible as desperate; the now poorly adequate defensive crystalline satellites orbiting or floating around the desperate kryptonians could simply not defend them again. And the once full of hope destiny challengers tried everything they could to repel the countless small horde that attacked them mercilessly. Kara's heart was now an empty kingdom where fear was the sole ruler; she backed fast, knowing very well that there was no other way than forwards. Thoughts raced one after the other; her only chance was right there! Right in front of her, if she could only reach it, if she could only shield herself from those creatures… Her heart glowed with new hope as a marvelous and obvious idea sparkled inside. \"Shield!, of course!\" she shouted in her mind. Kara stopped, summoned all her strength and last reserves of bravery, and charged forward, jumping has high and far as she could after a few paces, right towards the transporter platform in front of her and the implacable swarm. She couldn't possibly reach the pad with that jump, and the insects where be all over her in a heartbeat. Then, it happened; something amazing. Kara shut her eyes tightly and concentrated as much as she could, the crystals orbiting her formed each one a perfectly polished piece of a translucent crystalline sphere that close around her in the last instant, protecting her like a shield bubble from the little mighty aggressors. The sphere hovered long enough to cross and opened right over the transporter, before the small mutalinks could devour her clever protection. Kara felt the soft touch of the teleporter's floor under her feet and issued the mental command. Some mutalink insects managed to bite her just before she vanished. A soft and nice tone resounded across the elegant and scarcely furnished living room of the house of Zor-El, announcing the materialization of an individual over the house's teleporting pad. Kara reappeared and stumbled on the ground like a sack of potatoes; she was hurt and in great pain, clenching her teeth and shutting her eyes so tightly she almost felt her eyeballs where going to explode. She did her best to remain silent, but even with all her might she couldn't stop a few groans to escape her. She rolled over and tried to kneel up, she barely could, whatever poison or substance those tiny flying creatures managed to inject her with was literally burning her from the inside out, she was about to give up and scream as crazy and loud as she could when she felt the pain slowly fading away; her nexus bracelet was finally countering the substance poisoning her effectively, although it toke it more time that she expected, she was extremely thankful that it did. Kara opened her eyes and cheeked her surroundings, then rapidly took cover behind her father's large crystalline gravity armchair; as she planed when her foot touched the telepad, she ordered it to transport the little monsters outside the city, and herself to her parent's house. She knew the safest place was the core, but she needed to rescue her mother first; it was highly likely that she was still submerged in the virtual krypton, and if so...she would never see those horrible monsters coming to devour her until it was too late. She rose from behind the armchair slowly. No his or any alien sound was perceived by her ears; perhaps the monsters hadn't reached the residential area... Kara checked the insides of the house trough its conscience and gasped at the sight of one of those beast slowly approaching the armchair where her mother was still peacefully connected to her false reality, like a tiger stalking it's pray. She opened her desperate eyes and looked everywhere, she needed a weapon, a stick, anything! She remembered what her hands where touching. Kara commanded the crystal that formed her fathers favorite armchair to morph and change, transforming into a mighty mace with a massive spherical tip; the first homemade weapon of a civilization that had no place for violence nor war, much less any kind of armament. She gave it as much density and mass as she could, until her impressive muscles bulged proudly, and ran to face the creature with more desperation than courage. The mutalink jumped and attacked the beautiful and peacefully sitting blond woman, swallowing her up to her waist in a horrifically impressive bite, stealing a strange scream from her. Allura was still partially immersed in another reality, with her body releasing waves upon waves of pain to her now semiconscious mind. The creature broke the beautiful armchair she was sitting on with the attack and was holding her in her mouth like a leopard enjoying the last struggles of its prey. Kara entered the room. She only heard the partial scream and found her mother's body almost entirely sunken in the creature's expanded mouth. She went mad and charged the surprised creature. \"Leave my mother alone!\" Kara's desperate cry caught the creature's attention, but the monster was in the process of swallowing Allura and she was already too close to avoid the attack. Kara jumped and hit the mutalink in its mid section whit her crystalline mace with all she had, maximizing the effect as much as she could, hopping to force the beast to release her mother and attack her instead. The blow was tremendous. The gravity of Krypton was greater than earth's, forcing its inhabitants to be stronger than humans and many other life forms in order to live their lives in a normal way; and the artificial gravity at Argo was the same deal. Every regular kryptonian was faster and stronger then earth's greatest athlete; and Kara Zor-El had more than a regular life…she enjoyed the human's sport called gymnastics very much, and trained dally in the gravity pool to become faster and stronger. It was her way to fill some the nostalgic sensations the lost of her powers left her with. She was always in top form, and without a doubt, she was one of the strongest kryptonians in Argo. She even won a simple arm wrestling contest she organized at a kryptonian festival a few months ago. Her blow had enough power to turn a bowling ball into scrap. The resounding thunder was so potent and scary that she closed her eyes and clenched her bright teeth, unwilling to witness the effect. But the mighty blow had a completely unpredicted consequence: the hammer bounced back slightly and the returned energy forced her a few steps backwards. The creature's midsection had been deformed, but it started to reshape itself slowly and steadily, and her beloved mother was still in its mouth. The mutalink tossed Allura aside with such force that the woman flew and landed against the wall, and fell like a rag doll; her unconscious body was full of bruises and begging for relief. The creature then turned to Kara and advanced slowly, new sharp and long fangs, and serrated teeth grew in its mouth. Its claws sunk purposefully in the crystalline floor. There was no mistake about those signs; the monster was furious. Kara readied her mace and the hammered mutalink fixed his furious four eyes on Kara's improvised weapon. She charged again and the creature released a loud roar that turned itself into some sort of solid sonic beam. The sonic beam hit the spherical top of the mace and blasted it away in a million peaces. Kara screamed wildly and fell to the ground covering the right half of her face frenetically; it was badly burnt and hurting crazily. With the desperation of an injured and cornered mouse she started to drag away from the room in a futile attempt to escape the inevitable, then, her body started to vanish. The mutalink roared and jumped to catch its vanishing pray, but could only bite the shiny floor. Kara felt the familiar sensation of being materialized again, somewhere else. \"It worked!\" Zor-El hurried up and helped her daughter to sit. \"Kara, mi daughter, are you all right?\" blinded by concern, he barely noticed the awful burnings that now marked her daughter's otherwise perfect face. When he finally saw them, after checking her general condition with his Nexus bracelet, he scanned them and sighed relieved; her bracelet was already healing her wounds and vanishing her scars, leaving her body as impeccable as ever. Kara managed to speak even with every inch of her body still burning in pain and asked with a fading voice \"Father?\" \"I am here, Kara! Don't worry, we are safe. For now...\" She looked around, hoping to find a familiar face. Her tears started to roll out when that horrible reality hit her, still, she couldn't stop asking. \"Mother...\"she was sobbing; she was desperately praying and looking for a strength she didn't have any more. Zorl-El looked at her hurt, devastated daughter, and shared his own tears with hers. \"I am very sorry my daughter...\" He closed his eyes for a second, forcing out the words he didn't want to speak. \"She was still partially immersed in the Virtual Krypton, and I couldn't transport her here as I did with you. It was an experimental transportation system that only requires 1 single pad. I am sorry I only had enough time to save you and the system is already starting to destabilize...\" \"Where is mom?\" her face was an ocean of tears and fear. \"Where is she, father?\" \"That creature had cocooned her body in or sleeping chambers, my dear. I have scanned her as much as I could but I still can't determine her real condition, for those...things seem to block our sensors and are even causing problems to our transportation technology.\" he explained while tapping, and reshaping floating icons and symbols following him at his right. \"But my futile attempt to save my beloved wife gave me another idea, I have run a test and it will work! Kara, there is a way out. But a terrible one I am afraid. She read his eyes as looking into her father's own soul. \"Father, no!\" She turned him around and paralyzed him with eyes submerged in deep fear, she begged with all her heart. \"Don't do that! Please!\" She had been there, in that indescribable and chaotic hell, obscure, cold; where the only reality was despair, emptiness and desperation. No soul could endure that place to long without breaking down and dry. \"It is our only chance I am afraid! I can program the mouth of the dimensional gate of the phantom zone to respond to one of our nexus bracelets thoughts. It will work for everyone except for yours' Kara, for it was one of the prototypes and lacks some of the last protocols. But I have made you another, while preparing my escape route. Please wear it on your right wrist my daughter.\" \"Your escape route?\" \"I have isolated one specific transporter at the secondary star craft's bay. My personal research pod is ready to fly. And it is the only way, I fear… But this time that sacrifice will not be yours, my beloved daughter. You and the rest of us will suffer…but briefly, I hope. Still, you and our people will be safe from death's stinger. I need you to keep their hearts safe and alive, I need you to give them hope over there; you have the strength, I saw it, you did it once and you can do it again. I have instructed the phantom gateway to expand until it permeates the whole city, submerging every kryptonian; each one of us except me. I am redy to transport myself into the outer space. With enough power, and a bit of luck, I will be able to hide between layers of space time until I am sure those things are gone, then, I will jump to normal space, were there are more than plenty places to hide, and will build a cloaked lab and shelter in there; once properly configured, I will start all necessary researches to build a new phantom zone projector to get you, Allura and our people out to safety; even if it takes me a thousand years!\" \"Safe from death?\" A banished memory returned from the deeps of her mind; one she fought to forget forever: the living images of Zaltar falling into the dimensional storm that almost swallowed both. \"Zaltar died inside the phantom zone, father!\" her tears never left her eyes. \"I saw it and you know that!\" Zor-El sighed. He wished this moment would never come, and looked at her daughter's eyes as much as he could. \"Zaltar is not death, Kara. There is no death inside the zone, only suffering, eternal suffering. He must be drifting somewhere within the phantom dimensional storm; it is also possible that he stays trapped in the storm forever…\" \"You could have told me, father!\" protested Kara, unable to hold back how much those words hurt her; she deserved to know… and instead of the truth, her parents have lied to her. \"Why did you lie to me?\" \"If we would have told you the truth then you would have tried to go back there to rescue him, and then we could have lost you forever too. Forgive me, Kara, but I could not take that chance and neither your mother…\" Zor-El froze suddenly. He rapidly called a group of screens that showed the perimeter around the core, the access points and the situation of his ship; something was terribly wrong. The creatures where already reaching the core and in a few minutes they would be all over them. One more immersive three dimensional hologram appeared, unfolding the terrible reality before their shocked eyes; almost all kryptonians in the city where cocooned but. Kara gasped at the sight and shook her head, still refusing to believe the nightmare that was consuming them. And then, to their horror, a particular hologram showing Zor-El's small ship resting peacefully in a solitary room was flooded with mutalinks. \"Nooo!\" screamed Zor-El while watching the tireless creatures destroying his only hope, brutally fast. The scientist fell in his knees, his hand stretched towards the image of the destroyed ship before him. His hopes collapsed like a sack of rocks. He covered his face and his breathing became vague… The day their civilization was supposed to resurrect had become their doomsday. Kara wanted to say something, to do something…she just couldn't. Both became living statues for a tense minute; petrified by fear and desperation. Zor-El rose up slowly; young tears stroke his cheeks, testifying his defeat. But he still had a last card to play; one he heated more than the creatures that where destroying them and their paradise …but he diced to use it anyways. He turned to face her daughter, with tragic eyes. \"Our time has come, Kara. Providence as spoken, and there is only one more thing to do...\" He gave her the nexus bracelet he especially prepared. She shook her head; she knew exactly what he was going to do. The immersive holograms fused in one and showed the creatures outside the lab; they were fighting to break trough. Zor-El bowed his head. Kara though she would never see her father like this; he looked more than broken, worst than afraid: hopeless. Strangely, in that precise instant, she remembered Zaltar in the phantom zone and for a second she saw her lost friend's face in his father's. Not everything was lost back then… Something happened there that changed fear into hope. Then, she remembered her happy days in Argo and that \"something\" inside her started to awake again. She could feel it, even if she couldn't name it or understand it! She could feel this strange and overwhelming emotion rushing through her body again. She wouldn't give up, she couldn't! Kara looked at the monsters again; they only had a very short gap of time to activate the projector and send everybody inside, there was only one detail left, one that chilled her; one would stay behind. She saw the determination in her father's eyes, and her deepest fears arose again. \"Father..?\" \"Someone must stay behind and destroy the projector. Whoever is behind this attack must not follow us, my beloved child…\" Kara gulped as if she where trying to swallow ice cubes. New tears marked her pink cheeks and dropped on his father's hands holding hers'. She knew her father was going to give his life for her; she wanted to live, but didn't wanted to lose her father. And at the crossroad she remembered her long lost friend's encouraging words: \"Nothing is impossible Kara…\" She remembered something and her eyes glowed with new hope. \"Father… \"Kara hugged her father tightly, carefully controlling the little time they had left in the back of her mind. Zor-El looked at her daughter, sharing with her his love and the eyes of a defeated and condemned victim. Still…something confused him; Kara's angelical face was glowing with a rare strength and fierce determination in the sadness of their last moments together. \"I love you father!\" She cried loud and hugged him even stronger. Zor-El felt her warm tears touch his face and also the potent and peculiar sensation that always accompanied the activation of the phantom zone projector. Zor-El opened his eyes shocked and turned his head around. Kara had activated the projector while hugging him and now the pre-instructed massive phantom gateway expanded like a blasting supernova; permeating everything. For his surprise, he felt his body, his mind, his entire being changing; he was being canceled. The sensation was much more terrible than the greatest pain he could feel; it was real and absolutely unstoppable. He was trespassing the barrier between life and death, but still retaining his essence. He was turning into a living ghost. That sensation could only mean one thing. Zor-El watched in horror as the spare Nexus Bracelet he gave Kara was resting peacefully in his right wrist. He cried loud one last time as the indescribable might absorbed his whole self into the feared eternal kryptonian dimensional prison. \"Kara!\" called Zor-El, desperately fighting to remain in this reality. He was supposed to be the one to sacrifice his life for her daughter, not her life for his! Not again! But in less than a second his entire existence was sucked inside. Kara sobbed in silence as the prismatic dark purple gateway filled the entire city, passing harmlessly trough her. The mutalinks froze suddenly, their senses yelling at them that something was terribly and inexorably wrong. The dimensional gateway passed through everything, including the mighty beasts. They began to shriek and alert his masters telepathically about the unforeseen and still unclear potential danger. But the reason for the astonishing phenomenon became very clear very soon… The gateway permeated the silent cocoons and every kryptonian inside disappeared; engulfed into the dimensional prison, all of them… All of Sarack's wanted super slaves. The living conscience governing the Ranam Temple, overseeing the assault on the last kryptonian city, alerted Sarack at the same time his dimensional senses sprang alive, telling him that something had happened, something bad… \"Dimensional singularity detected.\" dictated a cold voice all over the throne hall. The war lord sat up and left his throne, troubled. \"Impossible!\" roared the warlord, desperately looking for an answer. He was a dimensional warrior, trained to sense and understand every anomaly and singularity in existence, but this…was more than strange, more than just a dimensional distortion. A crafted mystery, with a sinister purpose…A very powerful anti-reality the kryptonians managed to shape, use, and perhaps even abuse from. \"Analysis!\" demanded Sarack. \"Unknown inverted dimensional eruption in progress. I am still incapable to perform a dedicated analysis due to insufficient information and non existing entities.\" \"A simple 'I can't' would have been enough…\" The tattoos in the face of the cult's leader changed dramatically and the dots on them acquire a dark yellow that contrasted with his deep blue skin tone; he was very angry. Kara was alone…alone in the proud laboratory of the last Science Council of Krypton. Her enemies where outside, close to claim her as they did with her brothers and sisters. She looked at the images of the attackers feed directly into her mind by her bracelet with furious eyes; she had 2 more things to do. The kryptonian girl touched the control crystal of the Phantom Zone projector and gave it a very dangerous command. She walked close to the door separating her from the beasts and ordered the floor beneath her feet to grow a special protective crystal that covered her like intelligent water and solidified instantaneously. The creatures cut through the door and attacked the thick crystal covering Kara on sight. She smiled; it was time for some payback… The Phantom Zone projector imploded violently and a powerful singularity sucked all creatures inside an endless collapsing miniverse, and severally deformed the beautiful laboratory. Kara's weakened protective crystal broke into bits right when the implosion ended. She landed elegantly thanks to her gymnastic skills and scanned her surroundings quickly; her nexus bracelet showed her that the remaining beasts where apparently confused by the forces she liberated. It was more than she could have asked for; it was her opportunity. Kara Zor-El send a special command to the main conscience of the lab, one she had access thanks to her father… The roof of the damaged laboratory transformed and opened elegantly, like alien flower blossoming upside down. She watched exited and impatient as the Omegahedrons, nested in light buds, that powered the bright city, descended peacefully to her level. She fixed her eyes in one particular spinning orb; her hope to escape and save her people. \"Come...\" Kara called the small spinning power source, whose power was comparable of that of a small star, with her voice. 'Selena' levitated out of her place and drifted freely, resting gently on Kara's open palm after a swift flight. Kara issued the power source another command and feed it with a radical and risky programming. The orb spun faster and faster, until the groves and kryptonian symbols on its surface disappeared. She closed her eyes a little as the orb glowed brighter and brighter; it was time for the wonder. If that human, Selena, could use the matter and energy manipulation powers of the Omegahedron to mimic a strange power she called magic, then she also could use it to her advantage. Zaltar use it to build and animate things; she could do it too. It didn't matter how dangerous it was; her father's words echoed inside her heart, giving her strength \"You are a hero for me…\" she trusted her father's words. And heroes never turn their back on those in need. The Omegahedron grew smaller, until it was no bigger than a small pearl. Kara gulped and prayed for courage, then she swallowed the mighty little power source, hopping for a miracle with all of her heart. There was a story somebody told her, back at the distant earth, about a woman that turned into a salt statue. If there could be an experience that somewhat could resemble that. Then this was it. Her body experienced a terrible sensation and an intense but brief blast of pain. After it she felt as if her whole being was being smashed from the inside out, and violently transformed into something else, something completely unknown... The sensation was so overwhelmingly horrible that she couldn't even scream, only pray and hope the pain will go away, while struggling with every inch of her being to remain alive and conscious. A few seconds more and the pain was giving away to a disgusting new sensation, she felt like if her spirit was being ripped of her body and being put into another one, a cold and savagely strange one. But deep inside…there was an addictive sensation of immense raw power that stole a smile from her almost transparent crystalline lips. Her change completed fast, and she barely made it alive; she had jumped against all odds into the unknown; it was the only card she had, and it appeared to have worked. Kara straightened her new form and looked at her reflection in the palm of her crystalline hand, there were some barely visible patterns and marks inside that could resemble what had been once the insides of a kryptonian's hand, but only apparently. The change was complete. She screamed and turned around, heading outside of the core; the sounds she made where not kryptonian, but of a new life form. Kara reached the aperture in the core's shield from where the mutalinks entered and gazed to the vastness beyond. There were literally thousands of those creatures everywhere, covering almost everything. She clenched her fists and released another mighty war cry, full of rage. The mutalinks followed with their eyes the fighting declaration of the strange creature that resembled one of their escaped prisoners, but the readings they got from it where very confusing. The creatures hesitated and Kara stormed outside; she needed to get out quickly; her goal was not to destroy all of the creatures but to escape as fast as possible. Although the idea of turning them into piles of ash tempted her more than once, wisdom dictated against it; she only did a very dangerous improvisation to empower herself with the goal to escape in mind; she didn't know if her new powers where going to be enough or if she was going to be able to properly control her new form. Kara aimed at the closest beast in front of her and punched the creature, concentrating all her new strength in the surface of her fist. The result couldn't be more satisfying... The impact was awesome, and besides deforming the mutalink to an weird mass, it send it crashing against all others behind him like a meteorite, opening a clear path for her. The mutalinks behavior showed an unusual level of intelligence for a creature of it characteristics again, and the creatures started to avoid Kara's wild rampage with little to zero success. Until they seemed to organize themselves better to try a counter attack; but it was not even near enough to stop the mighty crystalline kryptonian girl. Kara, on her behalf, avoided to engage any creature not directly in front of her as much as she could, and enjoyed her new powers very much. One of the pack leaders send a command and a chosen one attacked Kara with amazing swiftness. Kara raised her hand, opened her palm and generated a scintillating star she shoot against the creature, sending him message of destruction. But this mutalink reacted fast and dodged it in an eye blink. The star passed at the creature's left. The mutalink roared and let its energetic serrated teeth to glow and invade the ambient light with its own. Kara anticipated the mutalik's intentions and with a triumphant grin ordered the star to explode. The shining projectile detonated right behind the creature. The growing blast struck the rear of the beast and literally disintegrated half of it , severally damaging the rest of the monster as well. Kara stepped aside. The mutalink cried out in pain as it crash landed close to Kara, carving the crystal floor repeatedly in a vain attempt to sink it claws on her. She ignored the perishing creature and faced the endless horde around her. She concentrated her mighty power and transformed her human form into a prism that grew exponentially fast. The mutalink horde attacked, but the crystal grew faster than they could devour or destroy it. The growing crystal peak was close to reach the high ceiling when the growth spur stopped and the small mountain exploded, disintegrating all mutalinks that where frenetically attacking it like an army of angry ants; revealing a mighty and gigantic kryptonian girl wearing a muscle shaped armor that was part of her own body. She looked like a giant ice warrior queen protected by a bio-crystaline shiny armor. When the fanatical beasts charged at her again in all their ways and forms, she unleashed her power at them like an enraged giantess. Kara created two, slightly different in color, vaporous spheres in each hand. She developed the spheres while pushing her arms backwards to build enough momentum and power. When the horde of attackers where close enough she released a cry that shattered the surroundings, and united the spheres in each hand with a clasp. The fused spheres grew even more and exploded in the direction of the attackers, releasing a hurricane of crystalline air that transformed all mutalinks into crystal balls that exploded shortly afterwards. A rain of fragments the size of sand grains flew everywhere. Kara released another war cry and advanced with mighty paces, but the fight was far from over. More mutalinks rushed to attack her from everywhere, as if she had fallen into their very own nest. Kara walked over the countless mutalink swarm at her feet, kicking them like small marbles. The beasts that avoided her mighty paces jumped up quickly afterwards, trying to climb up or attack her hells. But every mutalink that touched her crystalline skin for too long was instantly crystallized; the giantess smiled. Kara kept kicking and hitting the small beasts, sending them in an inevitable collision course against the ceiling, the walls, and the impeccable buildings that formed her precious city. She even blew a crystallizing wind from her lips that turned her attackers into silent transparent statues and covered her giant form with a liquid force field that vaporized the creatures on contact. She was getting close to her goal now, and the creatures looked confused; she drew a faint smile and kept her demolishing advance. The mutalinks stopped their fanatical charge and regrouped at a safe distance from the kryptonian crystalline giantess. Kara stopped too; she saw them adapt to their tactics before and how a rushed imprudence had cost one of her brothers everything. She chose to be like water this time, to adapt to their adaptation. A new mutalink chant echoed across the ruined cityscape and hundreds of small beasts combined themselves to form a huge growing ball of mutalinks that soon turned into a specialized pulsing organ. The grotesque giant object exploded and a new kind of beast emerged; a giant mutalink as big as Kara, even more menacing in appearance as the tinny versions. She could barely scan it for the giant beast charged, jumped and collided against her in a stunning impact, sending both to the deeps of Argo Lake. Tidal waves splashed everywhere and the surface became the face of chaos as the beauty and the beast battled in the deeps with all their might. The giant mutalink struggled violently against Kara's grip to bite her head, repeatedly snapping its monstrous jaws as close as as possible. Kara closed her eyes and turned away her head in desperation as terrible and painful slashes severally punished her new form; frustrated by Kara's strength, the creature had started to use its energy covered claws and spiked tail to harm her in multiple ways. The creature's claws where damaging her torso and legs while the wiping tail hammered her back. Kara screamed loud, held the creature's neck firmly with one hand in a colossal burst of strength, and grew sharp crystalline blades in her left forearm. Slash! A swift motion and the daughter of Zor-El sewered the vicious tail once and for all. The creature went crazy in that instant and shook violently, slashing and contorting itself without pause. Kara had to release it but she wasn't going to let that beast attack her again. The kryptonian giant grew a new crystal in her left palm that transformed into some sort of spear with hydrodynamic surface and vents. Kara swung the weapon and hit the creature in the head, causing visible damage and apparently knocking it down. In that instant she remembered a very interesting earth life form and mutated her spear into an underwater whip that looked like a tentacle. The kryptonian girl hit the giant mutalink with her tentacle-whip weapon and released it immediately. The whip acted as a living tentacle and wrapped itself around the monster, producing many other smaller tentacles from its surface that effectively incapacitated the monster and sent it to the bottom. Kara launched herself upwards and shot out of the great lake. She turned around as soon as her giant feet sunk slightly in the shore and shoot two crystallizing beams from her eyes that turned the water of the huge lake into crystal; trapping the wounded monster forever. Kara turned around, more confident now that she managed to defeat the huge mutalink, only to face two more giant monsters bursting out of their correspondent cocoons. She clenched her teeth and charged towards the already advancing twins. The battle was far from over. She rammed the one at her left, surprising the running creature, and pushing it until she knocked it and fell over a beautiful house in the residential area, turning it into bits and pieces. Kara rolled with the beast secured in her arms, then, she got up elegantly thanks to her gymnastic skills and held the creature up in a powerful bear hug; squeezing frenzy screams out of the monster. One wish and dozens of energy beams shoot out all around her body, liquefying the creature in her arms; she was more than eager to return the favor to these creatures and now she did it. Before she could react the other giant mutalink attacked her from behind, stamping her on the ground. Kara spun around as the beast slashed at her with its claws and tried to bite her head. She used her forearm as a shield and the creature bite it without hesitation. She smiled in spite the pain; a crystallizing aura grew out of her crystalline skin, permeating trough the creature's head all over, causing it to open its yaws and retreat in pain. The creature began to crystallize and the creature's natural defenses fought it unsuccessfully; the new variety of crystalline parasite Kara had produced was faster than the creature's countermeasures and crystallized it completely. Kara smiled and got up proudly, but her victories came with a prize: the giant monsters had managed to hurt her new form too quickly and she needed to be more careful. She was very powerful now, but not invincible. She was close to her goal too, but after reaching the perimeter of the residential area she would need to reduce her size to get to the city's outer ring and the airlocks; that would force her to fight her way against a much greater number of beasts. But with the aid of the Omegahedron's power she estimated she would make it. Two new giant beasts rushed against her in a coordinated attack. One charged to Kara's blind side with ferocity and viciousness, hoping to wound her severally from behind, allowing him and his brother who was attacking her from the front to bring her down effectively. The beast was about to reach her when a very familiar face surged from the back of Kara's head, and faced the incoming beast with enraged eyes. The giant mutalink was slightly surprised and loosed it's momentum, giving Kara the time she needed. It worked... Soon, not just the face but a perfect clone of the kryptonian giantess emerged from her back as if it had been living inside her the whole time. The new giant Kara rammed the beast and applied a submission maneuver that brought both her and the monster to the ground. She was dominating the creature and increasing the pressure applied to the creature's neck and torso until the beast reacted and began to slash at her with its powerful claws as much as it could even in the difficult position. Kara II felt the pain and the wounds the beast was carving on her living crystalline body. She shut her eyes and repeated the maneuver that brought the other giant mutalink down; an aura of aqua blue light expanded from her body, from the inside out, starting to liquefy it. Kara II rose to her feet and held the creature up fiercely, forcing her liquefying aura to consume the creature completely, countering any and every futile attempt the beast was making to free itself from her colossal strength. In a few seconds the alien beast was so badly consumed that it was no longer necessary for her to keep the embrace. She tossed away the dissolving remains of the creature to the other one fighting the original Kara. Kara I managed successfully to use her attacker as a shield that received the dissolving beast tossed from her sister. Both beasts where consumed by the same power an both giant Karas merged again and watched the multitude of enemies that was rushing to attack her. The swarm of mutainks seemed endless, for each mutalink she disintegrated or vaporized a hundred more where replacing it, and the city appeared to be literally over infested with them; from creatures whose only goal, now that all citizens except her had been locked inside the Phantom Zone, seemed to be her annihilation…or painful subjugation in the best case. The mutalinks understood quickly that it would be everything but easy to subjugate or terminate the giant female trough brute force and started to attack her with energy and wave force weapons instead of claws and fangs. Kara produced elegant shields that grew out of her forearms to protect herself while a new specialized bio armor covered her body. The kryptonian girl was quickly overwhelmed with enemy fire from the smallest to the largest creature. Some shots where easier to block than others, and some could even harm her new armored form. Kara enlarged the shields in her arms until she formed two perfect half spheres and encapsulated herself with both halves. The sphere self sealed and took the enemy fire with pride. The creatures intensified their fire to the maximum, and the perfect surface of the transparent crystalline sphere that shielded Kara started to show scars and bruises; her defense was mighty, but not impregnable to such vicious and endless firepower; the shield had started to deform and wear out like a drying fruit. Kara concentrated as much power as she could and when the badly battered shield was close to break down she released the concentrated power. It appeared like the release of a nuclear detonation. The blast turned everything around into a great and blinding void, and severally deformed the basic shape of the city, but thanks to its regenerative qualities and reinforced structure it didn't collapsed. An apparent calm settled down and she allowed herself a few seconds to relax, but never let her guard down, her senses where still at full alert. The city's still alive senses told her about the presence of something as big as Argo City anchored to it outside. The fight could be far from over, but now that she had managed to wipe all of the creatures she was confident that she could reach her exit as planned. The city trembled and agonized suddenly, deep wounds formed inside and outside. It was starting again. Kara looked at the floor ahead with a shocked expression. A huge thing broke the floor in the middle of the residential area and climbed up. It was an incredibly big monster, and it looked much more menacing than even the giant version of the small ones. It had a frightening presence, like nothing she ever saw before. The Broom. This time she took the initiative and attacked first, with her crystallizing beams. The shots hit the unmovable monster with a beautifully effect, but nothing happened. The creature snarled and roared as the faint effect of the beams diluted in its skin, without mayor consequences. Kara clenched her fists and backpacked slowly; that creature seemed to be much more powerful than the others and probably immune to some of her attacks. She was about to try something else when the monster attacked her with an spherical shock bomb. The bomb looked like energy in form of organic tissues and when it exploded the effects were very devastating. The eroding shock waves pulverized everything around and severally damaged Kara's crystalline body armor, sending her flying straight to crash deep into the crystallized lake. Kara was about to try to stand up when the broom landed on top of her, attacking without mercy. The creature held her limbs firmly with his numerous arms and a forest of liquid energy strands surged from its exosqueleton, attacking her like vicious snakes. Kara felt her armor suffering and giving up. She struggled as much as she could but her strength couldn't break the creature's monstrous grip. The attack was even destabilizing her capabilities to the point she could not produce active nor passive defenses anymore; she was in serious trouble... Kara was about to lose hope when the sight of the countless little monsters running around her gave her a marvelous idea, ad like a spark of hope in dark times, that idea reinvigorated her. She roared back at the monster roaring at her face, her giant body became grayish, changing its very own nature. Kara clenched her teeth and concentrated deeper. A small human silhouette delineated in her giant's forehead; it acquired volume and in an instant, the smaller human rose from the surface, jumped down and ran as far away of the struggling giants as she could. The Broom was slightly confused, for the giant Kara in his clutches was still fighting for her life, while a small, sleeker version of her, grew out of her forehead and ran away. The Broom ordered the mutalink swarm to intercept the runner immediately. In that instant the giant Kara under the Brohm broke into thousand pieces, each piece turned into a perfect clone of the small runner. The Broom was surprised by Kara's cleaver move and couldn't react fast enough. The thousand Karas smiled and began fighting their way out, each one with impressive skills; displaying power, grace and cleverness far beyond their enemies. The game changed again and the swarm quickly switched tactics; all mutaliks around hurried to chase down and attack the fast moving clones. Kara regained some confidence in the middle of the battle; the greatest advantage of her new cloned form was that every one of her clones would act and react just as she would, so it was impossible for her enemies to determine which one was the real Kara Zor-El. But the monsters swiftly realized what had happened and the command to hunt down every single clone spread rapidly among the pack leaders. Kara's advantage had worked marvelously. She was running in the middle of a group of a hundred clones staffing towards the academy, and the odds very favorable; her new warrior partners combined their abilities to repel the intruders like a specialized commando unit, using all the Omegahedron's capabilities to neutralize the monsters with stunning efficiency. And it worked. Fortunately, Kara's group was not as heavily attacked as other ones, which worked on her speed advantage. She was about to cry victory in her heart when the headers in her group stopped before a weird sight; about a hundred yards away, a group of fiercely looking mutalinks with different color patters and symbols split to let another kind of creature to emerge from the center of their formation. It was a bipedal creature, but its legs where similar to the ones of an ostrich; it was covered by some curios skin that appeared to be a very powerful natural transparent bioluminescent armor. He had two big neon bright purple eyes that glowed into his transparent featureless face that rested in an oval head, different from anything she had seen before. Kara's shock and fear was momentary overwhelmed by her natural kryptonian curiosity. What kind of being was that? She couldn't recall it from their knowledge libraries so it was highly likely they have never seen nor cataloged them before. But another force, a vital question, quickly subjugated all others: was he or she or both, responsible for the attack? Kara couldn't speculated about as much as she wanted for the elite group of mutalinks preceding the strange alien charged at her group with all their might and speed. Her clones could barely hold their demolishing charge and had to employ everything they had to push them back. The strange alien gave Kara's clone group a strange look and produced four differently colored dual layered energy balls in each one of his four arms and merged them in one, like merging four water balloons; he launched the pulsing sphere at her group with a dramatic gesture. The eye catching orb imploded and exploded in the center of Kara's defensive formation unleashing a furious rain of flashing needles that sank into almost every clone in the group. Kara ducked and dodged the notorious luminous stings as best as she could and commanded her sisters to quickly avoid the mysterious alien, at the same time, she commanded the city to turn into an ever changing labyrinth, effectively insolating the alien warriors and his minions from her and her battle group. Kara looked ahead; the perimeter airlocks where near now and so was salvation. She ran a few yards until a sharp pain in her left side almost knocked her down. She looked down and beneath her armpit; she had been wounded, and could clearly see the remains of one of those light stings dissipating in the air like smoke, but something had gotten inside her, something that infected her new form. Her eyes hurt a little and she started to feel disorientation and dizziness; she thought it was impossible, but if it happened, that creature must have an immense power... And to make things worse, it was not just her, but also all clones around that where hit started to lose coordination as well, as if infected by some kind of disease. Kara shut her eyes tightly and struggled fiercely against the poison inside her and searched for strength in her heart; she remembered her father, her mother, and all other kryptonians whose future lay in her hands. She couldn't give up. She wouldn't! The strong kryptonian girl ignored the breaking pain and commanded the nexus technology in her wrist to counter whatever was attacking her. Kara and her group engaged in a terrible fight against a group of mutalinks that where blocking her way inside the academy and the ones after them. The advance of the group found a brutal resistance at the entrance and managed to get trough after sacrificing more than half of them. Kara split the remaining clones in three groups, and prepared her trap. The other two groups ran towards the nearest and easier to reach transporting pads, while her group went to the gravity pool. Most mutalinks at the academy attacked the first two, just as she expected, even when the transporters where malfunctioning the mind behind the monsters knew of their potential risk and decided to deny her any access to it; fine...she wasn't thinking on using them anyway. Her group stopped in the center of the gravity pool and stood their ground. The mutalinks wasted no time and aggressively fought the clones and Kara, who withdrew from the pool when all the beast around where inside and engaging her clones. She issued a mental command to the pool and the crystal that formed it became red; warning all people inside and outside that the gravity setting being ordered was much above safety levels. A terrible symphony of cracks, bangs and pains screams resounded across the room; all mutalinks in the pool where almost instantly crushed by the powerful gravity field. She grinned and went with her remaining clones to the praying chapel; it was empty. Kara entered and closed the ample room without delay; she called a special crystal from the data grove at the left wall and began reprogramming it for her ultimate vanishing trick. A new group of mutalinks arrived to the perimeter of the praying chapel seconds before the whole building exploded in a thunderous explosion. The beast that where far enough managed to shield themselves from their brother's terrible fate and looked for their target: there were seven clones advancing in seven different directions. The mutalinks split as well, eagerly chasing the runners down, completely ignoring a very special and harmless Ciser crystal that flew high above, among whit other service crystals that where working in the academy. Kara relaxed as much as she could inside the small egg shaped transportation crystal and commanded it to discretely fly towards the nearest airlock. Her nexus bracelet informed her that the creatures where not attacking the fundamental bio crystals inside the confined airlocks; for they could practically never be used as escape pods nor ships, but theoretically...that was another deal. The mutalinks where still chasing and fighting against Kara's clones everywhere in the city, while their real trophy reached her goal unsuspected. Kara's Cicer crystal went through the airlock wall as if it passed through a water wall, and opened like a blossoming flower at the other side, letting its precious cargo stumble to the ground. Kara stood up and touched the big and shiny fundamental bio crystal floating in the center of the small room while issuing similar instructions to all the other crystals in all airlocks around the city. The crystal before her morphed beautifully and became once again one of her secret ways to fly around the inner space unsuspected. It was time to leave, forever...and to face death in a duel of time. Kara fell on all fours as she reverted her transformation painfully fast, and became a normal kryptonian once again; she could have reverted her empowered nature slower, but that was not an option. She spat the shiny power orb into her palm and watched as it grew back to its normal size. The wound at her side burned again, much stronger this time; without the power of the Omegahedron to augment her nexus bracelet capabilities she was more susceptible to the poison that was threatening her life. She didn't know if her bracelet was going to be able to counter it, and even if it could, if it would do it before the poison inside her could claim her life. She summoned her strengths, stood up and gave the powerful kryptonian power source one last command; one last sacrifice must be done; the destruction of everything her brothers and sisters worked and lived for. None of those monsters should remain to follow her. \"Father, mother, my brothers and sisters, please forgive me! Kara shouted loud and threw the collapsing power source deep inside Argo. The baseball size energy power source flew straight through the door and to the center of the city, making its own path like an intelligent missile while Kara entered the restricted space of the crystalline craft and assumed fetal position. the small improvised ship closed herself and produced the life sustaining gel that would protect its passenger and keep her alive. Kara counted the last seconds and ordered all airlocks around the city to open. She launched all morphed crafts at the same time than her own, and thanked Rao for escaping; she only had time for a few tears. The otherwise marvelous sight of her floating home was corrupted by the presence the huge alien hive that was hooked to it. The Ranam Hivor was attached to Argo City with multiple energy suckers; it detected the small crafts immediately after launch and send an equal amount of bio figthers to hunt and destroy each one of the small eluding probes; the attackers resembled alien spiders with spiked legs and bio luminescent membranes that impelsed them to astounding velocities. Kara perceived the imminent danger trough her probe's senses and concentrated at maximum to dodge the imminent attacks; she had no means to defend herself now and her only weapon was time; she counted the last seconds and prayed even more that her plan would work as expected. The Omegahedron arrived near the core of the city, flying above the batlle, and detonated in an explosion that was more beautiful and devastating than anything any kryptonian ever saw before; it was the first time an Omegahedron self destructed and provoked a chain reaction with the others that where still functional. The blast expanded spherically and advanced dramatically fast, consuming everything on its path without exceptions. The Hivor released the perishing city and tried desperately to escape but the fury of the blast was too fast and engulfed the giant nest in a second; a strange scream echoed through various dimensions as one of the Ranam Cult's proudest weapons and a countless horde was mercilessly consumed and turned into nothing. Kara forced her pod to accelerate to damaging point; if she failed at her calculations even for a fraction, her life and hope would be consumed. The super blast kept expanding violently. The last girl of krypton yelled in pain as the wound on her side and the concentration needed to escape destruction demanded everything from her. The bio hunter at her tail tried to escape the expanding sphere of destruction behind it but it was too late, still, in the last possible second fired at Kara's speeding pod and hit it before being consumed. The kryptonian craft shuddered with the impact and momentarily lost control. Her probe had been hurt and the damage was spreading trough it like a rapidly developing disease! Her ship had being attacked by some kind of very aggressive parasite within the shot and it was consuming her escape hope too fast. She merged her mind with the probe's artificial intelligence and instructed it to counter the microscopic invader as best as possible, but the thing had already affected it more than just superficially. She had to make the transition now!There was no time left. Kara commanded the probe and prayed loud. The kryptonian research craft became translucent and drilled trough the inner space reality, drilling straight trough an ocean of dimensional unrealities to the infinitude of the outer space.

Pero no todo puede ser felicidad, veran con la inminente destrucción de Kripton mi familia buscaba la forma de salvarnos. Pero todo fue imposible, el planeta estaba muriendo,ni siquiera mis padres siendo cientificos pudieron encontrar una solución. Ellos en su desesperación, tomaron la decisión de enviarnos a mi primo y a mi al planeta tierra y así poder salvarnos. --Debes ser valiente mi niña-- dijo mi madre -- deberas cuidar de tu primo, no debes de estar triste por nuestro destino, tendras que aprender a vivir con este dolor. --Pe.. pero mamá, no quiero irme -- dije con lagrimas en los ojos -- quiero estar con ustedes. -- No mi niña, ustedes se tienen que salvar -- dijo con la voz quebrada -- No todo es dolor y perdida, encontraras la felicidad y recuerda que siempre estaremos en tu corazón. No podia creer lo que estaba pasando, mi vida como la conocia estaba a punto de terminar, pensaba mientras contenia mis lagrimas. -- Algun dia mi niña, nos encontraremos en la luz de Rao y nunca nos volveremos a separar -- dijo mi madre mientras me metia en la capsula -- Nunca olvides quien eres y de donde eres, lleva con orgullo tu historia Kara Zor-El ultima hija de Kripton. --Mamá.. no... -- no podia formular una palabra por los sollozos que se me escapaban. -- Mi pequeña niña, siempre te llevare en mi corazón -- dijo cerrando la capsula e ingresando las coordenadas -- Te amo. Eso fue lo ultimo que dijo, aunque lo ultimo no lo escuche solo leí sus labios. Mi nave salio del angar donde se encontraba, desde ahí podia ver tal destrucción. Al salir de la admosfera había mucha turbulencia, podia divisar la capsula de mi primo metros más adelante. Teniamos el mismo destino, durante el trayecto entrariamos en un impersueño ya que la tierra estaba en otro Sistema. Todo iba bien entre comillas, hasta que algo golpeo mi capsula, causando que se desbiara y perdiera el curso trazado. Entre en un agujero negro, después de eso no recuerdo mucho. Solo recuerdo el estrellarme en un lugar muy verde y solitario. Estaba desorientada no sabia en donde me encontraba o por que estaba sola, me sentia debil, empeze a caminar buscando algo que me dijera por que estaba ahí. De repente escuche ruido, mucho ruido, me escondí atras en mi capsula, desde ahí vi que aparecieron personas con trajes negros y con lo que parecian armas, buscando algo , acercandose cada vez más a mi. Se dieron cuenta de mi precensia y me apuntaron con sus armas, gritaron algo, no entendia nada, y empezaron a perseguirme. No lo pense dos veces y heche a correr al bosque que estaba a un lado de donde me encontraba.[Chapter 2] Escuchaba sus pisadas y sus voces tras de mi, tratando de alcanzarme y disparando sus armas. No se cuanto estuve corriendo, cuando me di cuenta ya no había nadie persiguiendome, los habia perdido, pense con alivio. Observe mi entorno, había casas y personas caminando y conversando. Segui caminando hasta que me meti en un lugar en donde no había mucha luz, me escondí atras de lo que parecia un recipiente con un contenido que no tenia buen olor. Estuve un rato ahí, sin saber que hacer, veía a las personas caminar sin darse cuenta que yo me encontraba ahí oculta. Empezo a oscurecer y yo aun seguia en el mismo lugar, esperando ver alguna señal de las personas que me estuvieron persiguiendo. Al poco tiempo decidi salir de mi escondite, ya no habia peligro y yo debia de buscar respuestas. Estaba caminando, cuando una señora se acerco y me hablo. Yo me quede viendola, no sabia que me había dicho, no entendia su idioma. --No le entiendo --le dije, ella me miro extrañada y me volvio a decir algo que no entendí, como no dije nada ella me tomo de la mano. El contacto me hizo que me apartara muy alarmada, ella se dio cuenta de mi miedo. Se alejo y con señas me hizo saber que la acompañara, yo no sabía que hacer pero algo me hizo ir con ella, muy en el fondo sabía que ella podia ser de confianza. Llegamos a lo que parecia su hogar, ella me hizo pasar primero. Me quede observando todo, había una mesa y unas sillas, había retratos con personas sonriendo. Ella se me quedo viendo mientras yo analizaba todo, ella me hizo señas para que me sentara. Trato de presentarse, haciendo señas. --Eliza --dijo mientras se señalaba asi misma y golpeaba su pecho, despues me señalo a mi por lo que entendí, queria que le dijera mi nombre. --Kara-- le dije, lo unico que recordaba era a una mujer decirlo, supongo que ese era mi nombre. La mujer me sonrio, era una sonrisa bonita que transmitia confianza. En eso se empezo a escuchar ruido, personas hablando y riendo, Eliza se levanto de su asiento y volteo a ver a los que habían llegado. Tal era mi miedo que brinque de donde estaba y me escondí detras de Eliza, me asome desde detras de ella y vi a un señor mayor acompañada de una chica con cabello castaño rojiso, que me miraba con curiosidad y molestia. Eliza trato de presentarnos, el señor mayor se llamaba Jeremiah y la chica se llamaba Alex.[Chapter 3] Mi acoplamiento con la familia de Eliza los \"Danvers \", fue un poco complicada. ¿Por que ? Bueno se los explicare, para que pueda haber una buena comunicación, tienes que hablar el mismo idioma. Así que Eliza me estubo ayudando a aprenderlo, me señalaba las cosas o hacia las acciones y me decía el nombre que tenian. No fue complicado para mi ya que aprendo rapido, a los pocos meses ya podía hablar su idioma, aun no era experta hablando pero me las arreglaba. Eliza me pregunto de donde probenia, donde estaban mis padres y cosas así. A lo que yo respondi que ya había caido del cielo en una capsula y que era lo unico que recordaba. Eliza Desde que encontre a Kara sentí que debía protegerla, la empece a querer desde el segundo en que ella confío en mi. Cuando la vi camimando sola en la noche, me acerque para preguntarle si estaba bien, ella se me quedo viendo, su mirada transmitia confusión, se le veia tan perdida y sola, cuando me contesto, me quede tan impactada, podia jurar que no era un idioma de la tierra. Asi que decidi llevarla a casa y hacerle unas pruebas, para comprobar si era de este planeta o no. Al principio ella no nos dejaba acercarnos, tenia que ganarme su confianza, le empece a enseñar nuestro idioma, con el paso del tiempo Kara aprendio a hablar, es una niña muy lista aprendia rapido. Cuando nos conto que había caido del cielo en una capsula y que no recordaba nada anterior a eso, senti que debia hacer todo lo posible por ayudarla. Kara Eliza al saber esto me hizo analisis, ella y Jeremiah eran agentes en una organización del gobierno, me pidieron que guardara el secreto, no entendí por que me pidieron eso. Se sorprendieron al saber que provenia de un planeta ya extinto llamado Kripton. Ellos solo conocian a una persona que provenia de ese planeta, lograron contactarlo y le dijeron la situación que había. Estaba sentada en la sala de los Danvers esperando a que llegara la persona que ellos querian que conociera. Tocaron la puerta y Eliza fue a abrir, regreso con muchacho con lentes. --Kara, te presento a Clark Kent-dijo Eliza --Hola Kara- me saludo Clark tendiendo su mano, yo la tome correspondiendo su saludo, tal y como me había enseñano Eliza. --Hola --respondí mirando a Eliza para ver si había hecho bien en responder el saludo. --Los dejaremos solos para que hablen - dijo Jeremiah tomando la mano de Eliza -- es bueno volverte a ver Clark -- dijo por ultimo antes de salir. Despues de eso nos sentamos en los sillones, Clark me miraba, como si tratara de ver a travez de mi, como si fuera un misterio por resolver, en parte lo era. No podía recordar nada, había tenido flash backs de lo que parecia una ciudad moderna, una señora que me abrazaba y fuego mucho fuego, pero era lo unico, supongo que esos recuerdos volveran con el tiempo. --Kara, se que estas confundida-- dijo Clark -- pase por lo mismo que tu, como tu yo no soy de este planeta, llegue en una capsula como la tuya hace 27 años. --¿ De donde vienes? -- pregunte, Clark había obtenido toda mi atención. Me consoloba el saber que no soy la unica por la que paso por esto. Me hacia sentir menos sola. --Yo provengo de un planeta que se llamaba Kripton-- dijo Clark con una mirada triste,-- nunca lo conocí ya que me enviaron muy pequeño, pero enviaron a alguien para que me cuidara -- guardo silencio y despues continuo --me enviaron con mi prima. -- ¿En donde esta? -- pregunté con curiosidad, el se me quedo viendo con algo de nostalgia y tristeza. --Su nave se perdio y no llego a la tierra con migo-- dijo con la mirada en el piso. --¿Como se llamaba? --dije un poco triste por escuchar su historia, el alzo la vista y me observo como si buscara las palabras correctas que diria a continuacion. --Se llama Kara Zor-El -- dijo, me lo quede viendo, procesando lo que había dicho, como no dije nada el continuo --te enviaron a ti... Kara tu eres mi prima.[Chapter 4] Cuando Clark dijo que era su prima no lo podia creer, para empezar si se supone que era mayor que el ¿por que yo tengo 14 y el 27 ?, a lo que el me respondio que mi nave se quedo estancada en un lugar donde no transcurre el tiempo. Tambien me dijo que el sabía de Kripton y de mi, gracias a que nuestra familia construyo lugares ocultos en este planeta, donde ocultaron información de nuestro hogar y que solo nosotros podemos ingresar a estos lugares. Con el paso del tiempo el estuvo ayudandome a adaptarme, controlas mis poderes para así poder encajar. Pero no podía estar conmigo todo el tiempo, puesto que tenia un trabajo, que no podía hacerse cargo de una niña además de que el era Superman y que sólo le estorbaria. Así que decidio dejarme a cargo de los Danvers, mi relación con Alex no era la mejor, solo me dirige la palabra por que Eliza se lo ordena. Ella me decia que habia llegado a arruinar sus vidas. No les negare que eso me hacía sentir mal, muy en el fondo pensaba que tenia razón y seria mejor nunca haber llegado, pero Eliza siempre la regañaba por decir eso y me trataba de consolar diciendome que no era cierto.[Chapter 5] Pasaron 2 años desde que llegue a la tierra y yo seguía aprendiendo las costumbres de los humanos, estudiando en casa, ayudando a Eliza en las labores del hogar, pero hubo momentos en donde recordaba más y más sobre mi pasado. Esos momentos o sueños que tenia de mi vida en Kriptón eran los más dolorosos, cuando los tenía no hablaba con nadie durante días; Eliza decía que me cerraba y no dejaba entrar a nadie, me sugirió no hacerlo, que era malo y que podía contarle lo que fuera y así lo hice le conté como me sentía y los sueños o recuerdos que había tenido. Estábamos cenando, todos en silencio hasta que Eliza hablo --Kara, se que durante el día te aburres mucho --Alex, Jeremiah y yo nos la quedamos viendo esperando a que continuara. -- Así que tome la decisión, de mandarte al Instituto donde estudia Alex. --¡¡Que!!-- dijimos ambas al mismo tiempo -- ¡¡¡Me niego a que metas a esta en mi Instituto!!! ¡¡¡Ya bastante tengo con verla aquí todos los días !!!! --grito Alex levantándose de la mesa y yendo a su habitación muy enojada. --¡Mi decisión esta tomada! --grito Eliza para que Alex la escuchara, al poco rato se escucho un portazo. Los tres nos quedamos en silencio hasta que Jeremiah interfirió. --Estas segura? --pregunto mirando a su esposa. --Si y esta discución acabo, Kara mañana es tu primer día. - dijo por ultimo para seguir comiendo. --Gracias Eliza, prometo no defraudarte me comportare lo prometo -- dije un tanto apenada por todo lo que hacía ella por mi, por un momento pense que podria tener una segunda oportunidad para ser feliz.

However, I've learned that if you love something enough, you can learn to laugh at it, as well. ;) DISCLAIMER: I don't own anything. WARNING: Strong language ahead. Part I Once upon a time, there was this kid named Max. He lived with his bitchy sister and his workaholic mother in a house that was in some lame-ass non-identifiable neighborhood in the state of Who-Gives-A-Fuck. Max was lonely. But like the state's namesake, no one really cared. So one day, Max was building a snow fort/igloo thing (and eating the snow in the process). Um, ew! Doesn't he know what happens to snow on the ground? Good Lord, does he wanna get worms? But, whatever, he was building this kick-ass fort, and he wanted his bitch sister to come see it. So he was all, \"Hey, bitch! Get your ass out here and see my fort!\" And she was all, \"Hell no! I'm on the phone, motherfucker! Go play with your dumbass friends!\" Well, this pissed off Max. Everyone knows he doesn't HAVE any friends. So he vowed revenge! (insert lightning bolts and thunder claps) So Bitchy's friends showed up in their Cash-For-Clunkers-piece-of-shit car, and Max got a brilliant idea! He snuck over to his house and AMBUSHED THEM WITH SNOWBALLS! Oh, no! So the idiot teenagers went into combat, but Max retreated to his snow fort. And then they landed on top of it, practically killing Max with their fat asses. Well, Max was upset. He started to cry. And the teenagers did nothing about it. They just went back to their shitty car. And Bitchy just looked at her brother, and got in the shitty car. And then they drove off. Max wouldn't stand for this! There was only one thing he could do: trash that bitch's room! Yeah! Get it all soaked and shit! That'll teach her to piss him off! But then Max felt...bad. He was sorry he'd trashed her room. So he went and pouted for a while. Then his mom came home and was all, \"How was your day?\" And he was all, \"It sucked. Bitchy's minions wrecked my snow fort. And she didn't stop them, the fucking bitch.\" And she was all, \"Oh, is that all? Wow, you need a life, son of mine who's strangely swearing without my consent.\" And then Max was feeling EVEN WORSE about what he'd done, so he showed his mom Bitchy's ruined room. And she was all, \"What the fuck is this? Why would you do this, you little shit? Dammit, you're a fucking moron!\" So they cleaned up the room with towels. FUCKING TOWELS. Yeah, they didn't use Bounty, the quilted quicker-picker upper. What the hell is this, Spike Jonze? Anyway, later that night, Max went to bother his mom while she was working on her dinosaur of a computer. Then they wrote an emo vampire story together, and published it, and it put Twilight out of business. The next day at school, all the snow was magically gone. Yeah, there was, what, two fucking feet of snow one day, and then the next, it's all gone. What, did Aslan come and make the snow go away? What the fuck? Max was really scared, because his hippy teacher was all, \"Yeah, the sun's gonna die, and we're all gonna die. Just sayin'.\" And Max was all, \"Why are you telling me this, motherfucker? I'm nine! I don't need to hear this shit!\" But the damage was done. Max built a fort that night in order to save himself. And he was all, \"Mom! Come look at the kick-ass fort I made!\" And she was all, \"Shut up! My man whore's over right now, and I'm paying attention to him!\" Max got even more pissed off, so he put on his wolf suit (yeah...his wolf suit...I don't get it, either) and went downstairs to raise some hell. He dissed the dinner his mom was making, and then he refused to get his sorry little ass off the counter. And the mom was all, \"What the hell? Get off the damn counter!\" And Max was all, \"Bitch, feed me!\" So they chased each other around the house, and Max bit her. And she was all, \"Motherfucker, that hurt! You're fucking out of control, you little ass!\" And Max was sad. So he ran away. He thrashed around because he was crazy, but then he found a boat! A fucking boat, out in the middle of nowhere! What the hell, was this kid high or something? Whatever, he got in and sailed away. He was on that boat for WEEKS. And he was BORED. But then he saw land, and tied his boat to a rock. And then he scaled a dangerously-tall cliff and almost died. And then he finally found something cooler that would make his life fucking awesome. But I can't tell you yet. You'll have to read the next part to figure it out![Chapter 2] Part II So, what did Max find, you ask? He found a big bunch of hairy-ass monsters, that's what! They were tearing the shit out of these balls of sticks, and Max wanted to destroy shit, too! So he went and started destroying stuff, but then the biggest monster, a pimp named Carol, stared sniffing him. Well, Max sniffed him right back! No one scared Max! And Carol was all, \"Oh, you're okay! You can help me tear the shit out of our homes!\" So they continued with that. But the other monsters were all, \"Um, what the hell? Why are you doing this, you ugly little bitch-ass?\" And Max was all, \"That pimp told me I could!\" And the others were all, \"Well, we're going to blatantly ignore you said that and eat your ugly little ass, motherfucker!\" But Max was all, \"BE STILL! I'm a king, dammit! If you eat me, I'll kill all your sorry asses!\" And they were all, \"Omigod, he's a KING! A fucking king!\" And so they crowned him king. And then he said, \"Let the wild rumpus start, bitches!\" And then they slammed into trees and lost brain cells and did a bunch of pointless shit, but it doesn't matter! They had FUN! Then they all slept together in a big orgy - I mean, pile! And Max talked to this one female bitch who looked kinda like Carol, and no one really knew if she was his whore or not. Whatever, in the book by Dave Eggers, it states that Max has feelings for this chick, so much that his stomach starts oozing down his legs. I'm not joking! Go check out the book and find it! I swear it's there! What, is he having an erection or something! That's fucking disgusting! Anyway, Carol kidnapped Max the next day, and they walked across the desert and shit. And Max was all, \"Yeah, the sun's gonna die. Just sayin'.\" And Carol was all, \"Hellz to the no, it can't die! I'll beat its sorry ass if it ever tries to!\" So then they found some lame-ass creation Carol made. It was a model city of all the monsters, because Carol is a creeper like that. And Max was all, \"We should do this in real life!\" So all the monsters decided to make a giant fort that looked like the Death Star. Oh, yeah, REAL ORIGINAL THERE! But the the other monsters were pissed. They were all, \"Max, why is Carol your favorite? Are you two together or something?\" And Max was all, \"Oh, hell no! You're just being a bunch of whiny-ass fuckers!\" Then that one bitch was all, \"Yo, let's bring my Harry Potter owl rip-offs to live in the fort!\" And the others were all, \"Fuck yes!\" And Carol was all, \"Fuck no! They suck ass!\" So Max was all, \"Let's have a dirt clod war!\" And the others were all, \"We don't know what the hell this has to do with making a fort, but fuck it!\" So they threw shit at each other, and everyone got hurt. And they were all pissed off again. Then more pointless shit happened, because this movie doesn't really have a plot, but whatever! Carol got scared that the sun would die, and he tore one of the others' arms off! Holy fuck, isn't this a kid's movie? There was no blood, though! There was SAND! That makes it better! Well, now the shit has hit the fan. Carol decided it was time to kick some ass, so he chased after Max to try and eat him. But that bitch ate him instead, to hide him. Yeah...that makes sense! Then Carol felt like shit for doing that, but he wouldn't talk to Max. And Max was all, \"Yeah, I fucked up big-time. I think I'm gonna go back to my crib, suckers!\" So he got in his boat and ditched the sorry-ass monsters. And they howled, because they were sad. Even though Max had ruined their lives, they would miss him.[Chapter 3] Part III So Max sailed for a long time, and he magically made it home THE EXACT SAME NIGHT HE LEFT. Seriously, I think this is ripping off Narnia! Anyway, Max made it home, but he was all, \"My mom's gonna kick my ass for biting her and leaving! Shit, I'm in trouble!\" But the mom was all, \"Yay you're home! I didn't even call the police or try to find you! But fuck that shit, you're home!\" And she gave him food, and he ate it. THE END No, seriously. That's how it ends. Hey, don't get angry at me. I didn't make this. Yeah, yeah, I know...it was GREAT, right? ;) A/N: I really do love WTWTA. It's one of my favorite movies, and I still love the book, too. :) I just thought this would be fun. Review, please! ","Summary":" A/N: Just for the record, I love Where The Wild Things Are.

I hope you like this chapter. More to come. Chapter 1: The secret's out Tess's POV I'm sitting in my office with a million things on my mind. Life was great when I first opened this club, now everything's going down the toilet. First the financial problems hit, then Georgia gets pregnant (thank god we found Ali, to replace her for now though), my stupid ex-husband is trying to get me to sell the club to some developer…then Sean and I spend one drunk night at my place and I wind up pregnant. Nobody knows yet, but I can't keep it a secret any longer. It's closing time now, and most of the girls went home. But when I get up and come out of my office, I see Ali getting ready to leave. I smile when I see her looking at the newspaper clip of her on her make up table, \"Hey.\" She smiles, \"Hey.\" \"You know that's a really good shot.\" \"I'm not used to seeing myself in the paper like that.\" \"Well, you might have to get used to it.\" \"I don't think I ever could.\" You know, I don't wanna come off like the wise old fairy godmother, but, maybe you could learn from my mistakes.\" \"You don't like Marcus, do you?\" \"No, I don't. I don't like him, I don't trust him, I don't think you should trust him.\" Ali looks at me, \"Is that what's best for me, or what's best for you?\" I shrug, \"I don't know. I hope it's best for both of us.\" \"Night, see you tomorrow.\" Ali smiles lightly and walks out. \"Night.\" I sigh. I wish Nikki were like her. \"Oh, there you are.\" a voice from behind me says. I turn around and smile a little. \"These things desperately need your glue gun. Especially this one.\" he says, placing a few outfits in my arms and motioning to the outfit he's talking about. \"Ok.\" I reply, smiling a little. Sean can still tell I look worried. \"You ok?\" he asks, concerned. I try to sound assuring, \"Yeah.\" \"Ok,\" he says, \"She's not going anywhere.\" Sean kisses my cheek and walks away. I walk out into the lounge… \"Hey, Tess!\" Dave, our DJ, calls from his booth, \"I got that track you wanted to rehearse for tomorrow night's show.\" he says holding up a CD. \"Jesus…honey, I'm sorry. I got a million things on my mind and I completely forgot.\" I shake my head a little. \"It's all good. If you want I can come in early tomorrow morning…\" he begins. \"No, let's just get it out of the way.\" I say, taking off my jacket. \"You want a spot?\" Dave asks as I step onstage. I sigh, \"Yeah.\" Sean's POV I'm sitting in the lounge quietly listening to Tess sing… \"Feeling broken, barely holding on. But there's just something so strong, somewhere inside me. And I am down, but I'll get up again. Don't count me out just yet.\" she sings. Her voice is like an angel's, so chocolaty smooth. I could listen to her sing forever. \"I've been brought down to my knees. And I've been pushed way past the point of breaking. But I can take it. I'll be back, back on my feet. This is far from over. You haven't seen the last of me…you haven't seen the last of me.\" she continues. As she continues, my eyes fill with tears. When she sings, she puts so much emotion into the song. It makes me wonder if something really is bothering her… Tess's POV When I wrap up the song, I go outside and start taking the stuff to my car, only to be followed by Nikki. \"Tess, I need to talk to you.\" she says. \"No.\" I say, exhausted. \"Yes!\" \"I'm tired, Nikki.\" \"Well, then you can just listen! We built this club together, and then some girl comes in from out of nowhere who hasn't even paid her dues!\" \"How do you know what dues she's paid? This chick doesn't sing this way because she had it easy.\" I place the outfits in the trunk of my car. \"They don't come to hear us sing, Nikki. Or, or, or is that, is that just bullshit now?\" she questions. \"You know what? You're drunk, go inside and call a cab.\" \"I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs.\" \"Then leave.\" She gasps, \"You would ruin our friendship because of some girl you barely know? So much for loyalty!\" \"Since when did you know anything about loyalty? How many god dammed times have I peeled you off the sidewalk? How many black outs? How many times have I held your head over the toilet bowl while you threw up everything but your memories?\" \"Ok fine! But I will not stand in the back. Tess you've got to fix this…\" \"You think you're my only problem? I'm about to lose my club! I'm about to lose the only thing that means anything to me! I have more to worry about than you pouring tequila on your Cheerios.\" \"Fine. Fine.\" She gets in her car, \"I quit!\" \"I'm glad!\" I exclaim. She starts her car. \"Nikki, don't drive.\" Right before she drives away, \"By the way, I slept with Vince the night after your honeymoon.\" As she pulls away, I become furious and grab my crowbar from the trunk of my car. Then, I shatter her passenger seat window. She suddenly stops and looks at me. \"You crazy bitch!\" she screams. Then she drives off and I sit on the trunk of my car and cry, realizing that I said that the club is the only thing that means anything to me. Now, it the third thing that means anything to me. I feel warm arms wrap around me a few minutes later. \"Hey, it's ok.\" Sean says rubbing my back and rocking me a little. I look up at him with tears in my eyes, \"Sean?\" \"Yeah?\" I hesitate, then blurt out, \"I'm pregnant…with your kid.\" He looks shocked for a few minutes, but then he smiles, \"Really?\" \"Yeah. You're not mad?\" He smiles and shakes his head, \"No…in fact…Tess…I love you.\" I smile, \"I love you too.\" He kisses me, and I smile against the kiss. He really does care. He pulls away, \"Let's get you home. You need to rest.\" \"Ok.\" I sleepily say. I stumble toward the driver's side and Sean stops me. \"What do you think you're doing?\" \"Driving home.\" I reply, trying to get around him. He picks me up and puts me in the passenger side, \"You're too tired to drive. I'll take you home and stay there with you.\" \"You don't have to do that.\" I say, nodding off. \"I want to. I want to be here for you and the baby.\" he says, starting the car and driving off. I smile and start to fall asleep. \"Tess?\" he asks. \"Hmm?\" I reply, half awake and half asleep. \"Will…will you marry me?\" he asks. I smile, \"Yes.\" The last thing I remember seeing was his smile and him kissing my forehead. Then I woke up with him in bed next to me. I'm glad he's going to stick around. Sean is going to be a better father than Vince would be. What do you think should happen next or in future chapters?

It adds to the awesomeness. Read and Review! Enjoy! Sweet love, sweet love, trapped in your love I've opened up, unsure I can trust My heart and I were buried in dust Free me, free us He trailed his fingers up and down my spine. I closed my eyes and sighed. Never had I felt so peaceful in my life. He kissed the top of my head and I smiled. We had spend all day in the pool and half of the night in my bed, and now we were laying on my bed with just a single sheet over us. The speakers roared with music, that filled my room. I snuggled into his arms and let the sound of the music fill my lungs. I found a man I can trust and boy, I believe in us I am terrified to love for the first time Can you see that I'm bound in chains? I've finally found my way He laid back on his back and set my head on his chest. I set my ear to his chest and listened to his heart beat. I put his hand to my chest, to the beating of my own heart, and looked up at his face. He smiled, noticing that our hearts where in sync. I laced our fingers together and laid back on my back. The music helped calm me. It washed all worried away. So much, so young, I've faced on my own Walls I built up became my home I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us Sweet love, so pure It was like he could calm every cell in my body with just a single touch. I rolled over and propped my chin up on my hands and looked at his face. One of his hands started tracing designs on my back. His fingers left a burning sensation over the surface of my skin. It was entrancing to feel. I tilted my head to the side and closed my eyes. The words echoing in my head. It was like I finally found something to hold onto. It wasn't a crutch, it was a string of hope I could hold onto. Hope, that stayed by my side. Hope that stood on two feet. Hope that held his head up. I found a man I can trust and boy, I believe in us I am terrified to love for the first time Can you see that I'm bound in chains? I've finally found my way I am bound to you I am bound to He crooked his finger at me and smiled. I smiled back and wiggled up so that my face is two inches away from his. He kissed me softly on the lips and wrapped his arms around me. I snuggled up closer to him and sniff in his scent, and calm overwhelmed me. Never had I felt so entranced with a person before. He holds all of the love I could give. He is the one thing I know would never leave me. I feel like I can trust him. I feel like I can be myself without being knocked down for it.

Una montaña de papeles descansaba a un lado del escritorio mientras otro montón más pequeño iba creciendo lentamente a su mano izquierda. Tess rompió en varios pedazos el sobre que tenía entre los dedos y lo añadió al montón con los demás antes de llevarse las manos a la cabeza con un suspiro, masajeando suavemente sus sienes. Era un trabajo agotador que, esta vez, ni siquiera podía compensarle con la satisfacción de obtener buenas noticias. Por un momento se le pasó por la mente la idea de dejar todos aquellos papeles ahí mismo y pasar lo que le quedaba de noche pegada a una buena botella de licor. Pero ya había huido de esa forma en muchas otras ocasiones y debía ser responsable al menos por una noche. Ya habían pasado tres semanas y media desde que Alice se había marchado a Iowa. Le había pedido dos semanas de algo así como unas vacaciones para volver al café donde trabajaba y dar algo de apoyo económico con lo que había estado ganando en el club a la que por aquel entonces era su amiga, además de comprobar cómo iba todo sin ella después de casi un año y medio. Y Tess se lo había permitido. ¿Qué clase de persona sería si le negara algo así? Sin embargo, aunque no se arrepintió de ello, no pudo evitar echarla en falta durante todo ese tiempo. Sabía desde el principio que había marcado huella desde su estelar aparición sobre el escenario dejando al público boquiabierto, incluso a ella, pero no se había imaginado que fuera a perder tanta clientela debido a su ausencia. Así que sí, el motivo de que la hubiera echado de menos era, en un principio, meramente interesado. No obstante, debía reconocer que había empezado realmente a preocuparse por aquella chica. Le había dado permiso para irse durante dos semanas, pero ya llevaba una y media de retraso y no había sido capaz de contactar con ella. La puerta se abrió sin perturbar demasiado el silencio en el que estaba sumida toda la sala. Sólo había una persona que podía permitirse entrar en su despacho sin llamar antes. —Hola, Sean —lo saludó, dándose cuenta al instante de que había sonado más cansada de lo que esperaba. El hombre se limitó a observarla desde la puerta apoyado de costado en el quicio y envuelto en aquella penumbra que siempre inundaba la oficina acompañada de esa tenue luz rojiza, con una carpeta entre las manos y una expresión que indicaba cierta reprobación a la vez que compasión. Avanzó unos pasos hasta el escritorio y echó un vistazo por encima a los papeles con los que trasteaba. —Deberías dormir. —Si Alice sigue sin venir seguiremos perdiendo dinero hasta rozar el veinticinco por ciento —habló ella ignorando por completo el consejo de su amigo. Sean había estado con ella en cada momento desde que había levantado todo aquello de la nada y, a pesar de ello, era consciente de que ver insegura a Tess no era habitual en absoluto. Siempre se mostraba firme, y si no sentía esa seguridad se las apañaba por aparentarla, el caso era que ella no se derrumbaba delante de nadie que no fuera él. —Ha resultado ser más imprescindible de lo que parecía, ¿eh? —comentó Sean con cierto deje pensativo—. En la vida de este club y, por tanto, en la tuya. Tess lo miró tratando de mantenerse impasible, pero no pudo encerrar tras su labios la pregunta que llevaba rondándole la cabeza una semana. —¿Y si no vuelve? El tono con el que la pronunció delató su preocupación. Sean le dedicó una mirada a través de sus gafas de pasta y, tras un silencio que acompañó con un liviano asentimiento de cabeza, contestó. —Lo hará. —Sonrió como si eso fuese a darle más credibilidad a sus palabras (sorprendentemente siempre solía acabar dando esa impresión)—. Es de Ali de quien estamos hablando. ¿Tengo que recordarte el día que llegó? ¡Esto es su vida! Los labios de la mujer dibujaron una sonrisa casi imperceptible. Definitivamente ese hombre siempre lograba tranquilizarla. Estiró el brazo por delante de sí misma y él hizo lo propio hasta que se alcanzaron y sus manos se cogieron, para soltarse poco después, mientras Sean caminaba de espaldas hacia la puerta. —Me voy. Y tú deberías hacer lo mismo, Tess. Ella respondió con un ambiguo movimiento de cabeza que pareció significar un sí mientras pensaba \"tal vez más tarde \" y se enfrascó de nuevo entre todos aquellos números. Aun así no pudo desechar de su mente el pensamiento de que algo malo debía de haberle pasado a Alice para que estuviera demorándose tanto en volver.

This film needs more love! As I did originally write this as Georgia/Nikki it's slightly AU, as Georgia never got pregnant/engaged/married. BUT you can see it as a general thing too. So enjoy! And please review! People were fairly well behaved when visiting the Burlesque Lounge. They paid, they drank, they watched, usually too enthralled by the show to do much else. But there was always that one. Not very often, but he was there. \"Hey, gorgeous.\" The one that had to try his luck. Georgia glanced at the man beside her then turned back to Jack, fighting back a smirk when she saw how the bartender was eyeing him. They were closed, and she wanted nothing more than to relax with her drink while she waited for the other girls. \"You looked pretty hot up there,\" She rolled her eyes. Duh . \"What do you say I buy you another drink and we get out of here?\" \"Sorry honey, not interested.\" He laughed, deep. \"What? You think I can't afford you? I've got money, sweetheart.\" Now that got her attention. \"I'm a dancer , not a hooker.\" He laughed again – \"With the way you girls dance, is there much difference?\" – and made to grab for her shoulder, only to be stopped by a hand gripping his wrist. At first Georgia thought it was Jack until she saw him watching, bewildered, out of the corner of her eye. When she turned around she realised the well manicured nails should have been a giveaway. \"Why don't you get out of here before something breaks?\" Nikki all but growled. She twisted his wrist slightly for emphasis and pushed him away. \"I'm guessing it's pretty important to you, what with the way you talk to girls.\" Georgia laughed as he left – ego probably too bruised to continue. Nikki turned to her, giving her a once over. \"You good?\" \"Thanks to my knight in skimpy armour,\" she grinned, kissed the brunette on the cheek (With an exaggerated \"Mwah!\") and skipped off to greet the others. \"Ass,\" Nikki snorted.

He wanted to know everything about her and he wanted to know why I was in love with her. No one will understand why I'm in love with her you can't explain all your feelings in words. Love isn't enough to describe what I feel for her. After the interview I went home and as soon as I walked into the front door someone pushed me against the wall. It was Christina. I could not deny that I wanted this. She wanted me and I wanted her. \"I heard what you said about me in the interview it was so sweet, is your body as sweet as your words?\" she asked with a smirk. \"I don't know… why don't you find out,\" I said. We made love. Me and her were talking for hours on how life is and we talked about what our dreams were. She wanted another kid in the future. I've always wanted kids I just don't want to become a father when I'm in a band and on tour because I want to be able to be there for my baby to make sure she or he gets to grow up with a father. I wouldn't mind if Christina ended up being the mother to my children because I see how she is with Max and I've never seen a mother love her son so much. Being with Christina this night made me happy. I didn't want it to be over until bam I hear a noise of someone's voice. \"Adam wake up! Adam wake up! ADAM WAKE UP!\" I felt someone shaking me. Christina now became blurry then invisible. I closed my eyes then opened them again. It was my manager waking me up. All I did with Christina was a dream. I got pissed as he woke me up from dream that I didn't want to end . \"Adam your interview is in 5 minutes,\" \"What interview?\" \"Your interview with Jay Leno with you and Christina,\" \"You mean I haven't done the interview yet?\" \"No… Man where is your head today? Lala land? And what where you dreaming about… put that thing away,\" he said pointing at my pants. I loved the dream I had. I loved that it was with Christina but I was freaking out because I was with Anne not Christina. Plus I loved Anne with all my heart. Well some because Christina seemed to have the other half. I walked out of the dressing room and waited backstage until Jay told me that I'm on. I walked on stage and saw Christina's beautiful blue eyes looking at me. I got nervous but I knew I had to calm down before she figured out something wasn't right. I waved at the crowd and gave her a hug and I shook Jays hand and the interview started. The couch had to be one of the smallest couches ever because me and Christina sat next to each other shoulder to shoulder. Jay started springing out questions about 'The Voice' and Christina answered them the best as we could. \"So Adam… describe Christina,\" Jay said. I was a little distracted so I didn't hear him. \"S-s-sorry repeat that again.\" \"A little out of it huh? Thinking about Anne? I said to describe Christina\" \"Yeah Adam, describe me,\" Christina said. \"Christina is a beautiful talented woman,\" I said with a smile. \"Oh Adam, you're such a sweetheart,\" she said smiling at me and laying her head on my arm. \"Sexual tension,\" Jay said with a smirk. \"Oh stop it Jay I see Adam as a big bro nothing more,\" Knowing that she only saw me as a brother made me sad on the inside but I just played along and said she was like my little sister. \"So Christina…. Describe your big bro Adam,\" \"He's a muscular, good looking, pain in the butt,\" she said giggling. I flexed my muscle and she wrapped her arms around my arm playfully. Her touch gave me goose bumps but luckily I had a jacket on so she didn't feel the goose bumps. Jay kept springing out questions about 'The Voice' but I couldn't help it to look at Christina's beautiful face. I had my arm around her but everyone thought it was nothing but I thought it was something. I got so lost and I just stopped and right there I kissed her. The crowd gasped. \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Christina said as she slapped me in the face. I stayed quiet. I was speechless. I had no idea why I would embarrass her ad myself like that. But what really left me speechless was her reaction when I kissed her. I knew at that moment that she had no feelings for me. To save any more embarrassment I ran off the stage and drove home. I hoped that Anne didn't see the interview. When I walked in my house I saw Anne packing and I knew in my heart that we were over. \"A-a-Anne umm why are you packing?\" \"Are you kidding? I saw the interview…. I'm gone… I hope you have fun with Christina since she seems so perfect to you!\" \"Anne I'm sorry… I guess… I guess I just fell in love with her but I know you can find someone better than me.\" \"Whatever Adam, screw you.\" She said throwing a bracelet I gave her at me. She left and I sat there in misery. I didn't know what to do. I ruined my friendship with Christina. My relationship was ruined.

To lose the place would be like losing a limb, but that was exactly what was about to happen. In 48 hours this would all be taken away from her, the only thing that had ever really meant something. She carried on, traversing her memories. Her whole life, almost, was mapped out in this room. She had made a name for herself here. The girls had become like a family to her. But that was all going to be snatched away from her. But of course, she wasn't going to just roll over and take it. Oh no, she would fight to the end. Giving up was simply not in her nature, not when it came to something this important. Tess was strong, she could weather anything. But what she really needed now, much as she hated to admit it, was a man. Someone who could hold her and make it all go away, even if it was just for a moment. And not just any man. Sean. He always made her feel better, always put things right. If she was completely honest, she was in love with him. Head over heels. But they could never be more than friends. The best of friends. She knew that their relationship could never be all she truly wanted, but she also knew that he would always be there for her anyway. That was consolation enough.

When Tess walked in to the bathroom of the Burlesque Club she didn't expect to be greeted with the awful sound of vomit. She glanced down at the floor and recognized Georgia's black heels. Tess couldn't handle one of her best dancers getting sick especially since Nikki had been at her all time worst lately. \"Please don't have the flu,\" she said as Georgia emerged from the stall. She shook her head no. Tess then suddenly realized the seriousness of the situation, \"Please have the flu!\" She then took a very scared Georgia in to her arms and gave her a hug. An unplanned pregnancy did not do wonders on a relationship, certainly not one that could be as fickle as the one this poor girl was in, nor did it do wonders for Tess and her club either. She'd have to hold auditions and make sure the new girl knew all the dances without stepping on the toes her newly pregnant dancer. However, this was a time she need to be a mother figure. She comforted the sweet girl as best she could and sent on her way. Being left alone, Tess took the time to check her appearance in mirror. Her hands moved down her sides smoothing down the ruffles in her shirt and her hand ran through her, still dark black (thankfully), hair. Age was a cruel joke. She was once young and carefree just like the girls she worked with. She did the same stupid things, but that was in her past. Tess could care for them, help them learn from the mistakes, but this time her heart went out to Georgia, it was hard and she knew that first hand. Sean was the best man in Tess's life. He was a constant companion and the perfect man. The only down fall, he was gay. However, he always would know how to make her feel better. Tess and her on again off again boyfriend Vincent were currently off again. So Sean's big idea was to take her out of town. They went wine tasting, out clubbing, and by the time they got back to the hotel they were wasted. Tess always being the forward person, she made the first move. It started with a kiss and somehow they made it to the bed. The next day she woke up a pounding headache, cloths thrown across the room and Sean passed out next to her. When they were both sober enough to discuss what happened, the decision was to never speak of it again, and that's what they did. The club was doing well again which meant Vince and Tess were back on again. She was happy again and working hard on new routines for her girls and a solo number for herself, the introduction to be exact. The dancers would follow her every movement as she taught. Suddenly it felt like something hit her right in the stomach; she tried to shake it off, but to no avail, it hit her again this time with nausea. Tess quickly sprinted to the bathroom, Sean soon to follow ignoring the sign on the door. He found his best friend with her head bent over the toilet getting violently sick. His instincts took over and he grabbed her long dark hair. When Tess was done she leaned back on her heels and shook her head, she was obviously sick. Sean picked her up and quickly took her in a hug sensing her embarrassment. He then grabbed her coat and neatly placed her sunglasses over her eyes. They strutted out of the club like nothing happened. Rehearsal was over for the day. Tess couldn't believe it, not possible, not happening she thought as she paced the bathroom. Her eyes wouldn't leave that little plastic stick and that awful pink plus sign. She was not pregnant. Pregnant was bad with out a husband, worse without a steady relationship, and completely insane if the baby is her boyfriend's. Since the restart of their rocky relationship, Tess and Vince was not exactly celibate, but deep inside she knew that it was Sean's baby. In the month to follow after their one night rendezvous she had skipped her monthly cycle. It was always irregular due to the crazy, stressful life she had, so Tess thought nothing of it. Oh, but it was something, alright, something life altering. The first thing she knew was even if it is Sean's baby; she was going to tell Vince that it was his. That night of drunken intercourse was promised to never be brought up again and she wasn't one to go back on her word. Then again, for all Sean would know it did belong to Vince, he was no stranger to his best friend's sex life. However, then came the hard part telling people and then suffering through their reactions. Third on the list was the club. Tess knew she couldn't perform like this since she'd start to show soon. The girls would have to go on without her. Tess sighed, this was one mess she couldn't undo, couldn't comprehend, and couldn't even believe. Telling Vince was scary almost horrific, but he had taken it better than Tess had originally expect. He threw a little fit, then refused to believe it, called her a liar, but in the end owned up to the child. The girls were all ecstatic due to the fact it was a baby, they were naïve in this way. Now, telling Sean was a secret guilt trip. He was overjoyed to hear the news and from that moment on hardly ever left her side. Sean would go to every appointment with her and hold her hair when the morning sickness would act up at work. Tess knew from the start that she was being selfish by not telling him the truth just to save her own relationship, but she also saved his life. Vince would have killed Sean, he was always jealous of the closeness the two shared. Then there was the baby, Tess wasn't about to put a small innocent little life through hell with the mess she caused. It was something she couldn't do. Soon, it was obvious to hide the fact she was pregnant. Tess was big for being only four months along and the girl's couldn't keep their hands off their boss's new baby bump, which drove her crazy. Today was the big day though, the day they'd all find out the gender of the baby. Tess walked in to the club that morning with an envelope tucked under her arm. The girls all stopped and dropped what they were doing, Vince came out from the back, and Sean, of course, was right by her side. The room went silent and they all held their breath as Tess broke the envelope open. \"It's a boy\" She laughed. The room erupted in a giant cheer, then with out hesitation the stomach touching started up again. Sean stood there studying the ultra sound picture and pulled his friend in to a hug only to have her stolen by Vince. He reached around and gave her a kiss. His hands lingered on hers as placed something small into the palm of her hand. \"Vince what is this?\" she said with one hand placed on her hip and the other holding a small diamond ring. \"Tess, sweetie, will you please marry me,\" he dropped to one knee. \"Yes, honey, I will.\" It was late when Tess left the club that night, which was normal for her. She unlocked the door to her car, sat down, and finally relaxed for the first time since the ordeal stared. She laid her hand on her stomach studying the small bump and of course the new ring on her left hand. Then there was a tap on the window. It was Sean. \"Hey baby, be careful, there are a lot of crazy drunk people out tonight,\" he sighed as he kissed her cheek. As he left she started her car and made her way home to her new fiancé. As she crossed though the intersection right outside the club she saw it, a shiny red truck coming right at her little car, and there was nothing she could do. Tess woke up in a hospital bed with an empty feeling. Her hand reached down and touched the bump where her little boy once was. She knew he was gone, she didn't need to be told, a mother always knew. She looked to the foot of the bed expecting to see Sean, but much to her disappointment, it was Vince. \"Tess, Honey, the baby…\" he began to say with tears in his eyes. \"I know\" she managed to choke out before crumbling into his arms. Tess cried for what felt like forever in her world and on her perfect day too. She felt like shit, everything was messed up and it was all her fault, not to mention she ached from head to toe. Vince said he wouldn't leave her side, but she sent home not wanting to see his heartbroken face over a baby that wasn't even his. Then almost like clock work as Vince left Sean entered. He had a vase with pink daisies, her favorite. Unlike her future husband, Sean wasn't going to try to explain what happened or what could have prevented it, he was there for her. Sean took off his shoes and climbed in the bed next to her, resting his head on top of hers and placed his arms around her to hold her close in the silence. Without even looking at him, Tess sighed and whispered \"He was yours, you know,\" fresh tears sprung from her eyes. Sean didn't say anything; it was like she expected him to either. He just pulled her closer and buried his face deeper into her dark hair and sobbed with her. Tess glanced again in the mirror her hand moving over the flat emptiness of her stomach. Quickly she shook off any emotion, and checked her face. She took her time on the way back to her office examining every inch of the club she might lose, she thought of the replacement for Georgia, and replay everything her now ex-husband had told her. Then, as she opened the door to her private office she saw Sean sitting on the couch. Tess took her place next to him and his arms over took her like always and she cried. \"I know baby, I know\" he murmured pulling her closer, \"I love you baby,\" and sometimes that's all Tess needed to hear.

It was a Saturday, and if she got some time to herself, she planned to go see her friends, the seven Wild Things. It was a perfect day for it. She felt around under the covers for her plush Sully from the movie, Monsters, Inc. Rina loved soft, furry creatures that hugged and soothed people, and that was why she loved the Wild Things. Her father, Max, claimed to have known them personally when he was just her age, and would entertain his daughter with stories of how he was made their king, and led them on wild rumpuses. But most special of all was the soft lullaby he would sing to her at bedtime; the one about just closing her eyes and letting the Island of the Wild Things materialize and bring her comfort. Rina dressed herself in a Littlest Pet Shop shirt and Capri pants and went downstairs to see what her father was up to. But first, she had to use the bathroom. So, she went in and out as quickly as she could. When she exited the bathroom, she noticed her tall, tousle-haired father standing right in front of her in the doorway. \"Hi, Daddy!\" Rina greeted him. \"Hey, sweetheart,\" her father replied. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Uh-huh! I had another dream about Judith an' Carol!\" Rina replied, referring to two of her Wild Thing friends. \"Oh, that's great! Nightmares don't dare intrude where Wild Things stake their territory!\" Max answered, deepening his voice to a Carol-like growl and swishing Rina high in the air. Rina screamed with laughter as her father swung her about and snarled playfully. \"RRRAAAaaaaaRRRrrr! I'll eat you up, I love you so!\" Max continued, tickling his daughter under her arms. Then he set her down and his expression became more serious. \"Did you wash your hands just now?\" He asked her. \"Uh….no, Daddy… I guess I forgot!\" Rina replied. Max chuckled warmly and patted Rina on her shoulder. \"Well, try not to, all right? With this new flu virus going around, we all have to be extra careful. I wash my hands, you should wash your hands, Aunt Claire washes her hands when she comes over to do stuff with you…\" \"But, Daddy! Didn't we get shots for the flu?\" Rina asked. Now, that certainly hadn't been any day at the beach, but holding tight to a picture that she had drawn of herself being hugged by Judith had markedly eased Rina's fear of the Walgreen's clinician's needle. \"Yeah, we did; but this new strain is so tough that doctors haven't been able to turn it into a vaccine!\" Max replied. Rina nodded. She wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing. She hated to be sick, but like most little girls, she didn't care much for shots, either. She remembered what had happened when she had escaped to the Wild Things' island, trying to get out of getting an immunization against the standard flu virus: \"Anyone who wants Rina to go back home and get a shot so she doesn't get all sick and miserable 'cause we'd all hate that; raise your paws!\" Carol bellowed; and seven paws immediately shot up in the air. Everyone always did what Carol said. Judith tsk'ed and then said to Rina, \"Sorry, toots; 7 to 1. Go back to your Dad.\" Max turned to go downstairs, but not before tossing a small package of tissues for Rina to catch. \"What are these?\" Rina asked. \"Tissue packs,\" Max replied. \"Be sure to use them every now and then, okay?\" After she had breakfast, Rina walked down to the woods where she knew the boat would be waiting. She was bundled up smartly against the cool weather, and she was carrying the tissues in her jacket pocket. She took them out and looked at them with distaste. Shirtsleeves had always worked just fine for any itchy or runny nose she'd ever had. She was sure the Wild Things felt the same way. At last, when she had found the boat in the forest, she hoisted the sail and began the journey which seemed to progress through night and day, in and out of weeks, and almost a year. When she reached the Island of the Wild Things, she pulled the boat ashore- and noticed Carol and KW standing there ready to greet her! But instead of looking happy to see Rina, they looked worried. Carol, who was never able to stifle his true feelings about a situation, came rushing over to Rina and scooped her up. \"Golly, are we ever glad to see you!\" he panted, as Rina nuzzled him under his furry neck. \"What's the matter, Carol?\" Rina asked, as KW ambled over to say hello. \"We think there's something wrong with Judith! She's been sneezing all morning and we don't know why!\" KW replied. \"Oh, no! Poor Judith! Does she have a cold?\" Rina asked Carol. \"We don't think so; if she did, her tail would be dragging on the ground, like all of our tails do when we're sad or sick!\" Carol answered. \"Well, let's go to her! We gotta find out what's wrong!\" Rina announced. She broke into a run towards the woods and called as loud as she could, \"Don't be scared, Judith! I'm coming to help you!\" As she ran, the packet of tissues was jostled out of her pocket, and KW bent down to recover them and handed them to Rina. \"What are these, Rina?\" KW asked her. \"Oh, those are tissues. My dad made me take them with me.\" Meanwhile, Judith was lying on the ground next to a tree, where Ira was running his claws through her lion's mane in a comforting gesture. Judith heard the sound of running feet, and turned her head to see Rina running towards her. \"Hi, Judith! Don't worry, we'll find out what's wrong and make you feel better!\" Rina announced as she came running over to give Judith a hug. Judith opened her substantially-fanged mouth to say hello to her little friend, but ended up letting loose with a powerful sneeze instead. And that sneeze happened to catch in the folds of Rina's unzipped jacket and sent her gliding backwards about three feet. \"Oh, dear. Pardon me, sweetness,\" Judith said, looking embarrassed and bringing a paw to her nose. Rina was thrilled. \"Wow, Judith! That was fun!\" she giggled. She ran forward again, flapping the corners of her jacket like seagull wings. \"Sneeze at me again! Sneeze at me again!\" At that moment, Carol stepped forward to catch the little girl up in his furry arms and place her on the top of his head, where she would be safe. \"Better zip up that jacket, Rina,\" he said gently. \"Looks like it's gonna be windy.\" \"Yeah, Rina,\" Ira said, joining them. \"When any of these guys gets the sneezes, it's no joke.\" Carol turned his head to eyeball Ira's prominent nose and placed his paws on his hips. \"Well, you're sure one to talk, aren't you?\" he replied sarcastically. With that, he reached over and pinched Ira's nostrils together and went, \"HONNKK!\" \"Oh, you're a scream,\" Ira growled at Carol as he trudged over to tend to Judith some more. \"Judith; aside from sneezing a lot, do you feel sick?\" Rina asked the leonine creature. \"Nope, can't say that I do,\" Judith replied, pawing at her nose. \"I just have this really annoying sort of tickle in my nose!\" \"But you can't just scratch it on a tree, like you do with your horn when your horn tickles?\" Rina inquired, referring to the rhino's horn that Judith sported on the tip of her snout. \"Unh-unh. Believe me, I've tried!\" Rina sighed and began to swing her arms back and forth in a pensive gesture. \"Well, Judith, it looks like this is one problem that you can't just eat in order to make it go away,\" she finally said. \"Yeah, you're probably right,\" Judith replied. \"I haven't the faintest idea how I'm supposed to eat a nose tickle.\" She, Rina, and all the other Wild Things laughed at this. Judith tossed her fluffy mane in the air and laughed at her own joke, and then sneezed again about seven times in a row. Rina and the Wild Things were not quite alone. A nasty, globby little flu virus strain named Pukey Feelgross was watching them. He gave a devious snicker. \"Yes, go on and laugh, you fluffy-puffy hairballs! Everything's just a big joke to you lumbering flea mats! Well, your size doesn't make you totally invulnerable! Nyaah-haahh-haaahh!\" Pukey rubbed his bacterial hands together, and a wicked smile spread from one corner of his mouth to the other. \"Just an innocent little tickle in her nose, she says! That's where she's wrong! I've got a direct in with the histamines in her nostrils! That tickle won't be soothed away easily!\" Just then, the virus's \"pocket\" started to vibrate and and his phone's ring tone of \"Rock the Boat\" chattered on. \"That must be Horn-Schnozz's histamines now!\" Pukey said gleefully, pulling his phone out and opening it. \"Yeah!\" he barked into the mouthpiece as a way of greeting. \"Hey, is this Pukey?\" came the voice on the other end. \"Yep! How's it goin' in there? Is she still sneezing?\" \"Like a train, baby!\" the nasty histamine cackled. \"We never knew how sensitive she was to blossoming trees until we started this! We haven't had this much fun since Josh had his moving-out-of-his-mom's-basement party, dude!\" \"Dude, I know!\" Pukey replied. \"Well, keep up the good work, bro! And hey, y'know what? Next time you have her sneeze, make sure that little girl's in the line of fire!\" \"How come? I thought you-\" \"I like infecting little kids best! Their bloodstreams are easier to swim in!\" Pukey answered, hanging up. If his evil plan went well, he would crawl into Judith's nostrils and be catapulted at whomever she sneezed in front of next. And there was a good chance of the victim being Rina, given how close she stayed to Judith! What the evil virus strain didn't notice was that KW was getting an idea. KW gave Rina a nudge in the arm. \"Rina!\" \"What?\" \"The tissues that you brought! Carol has some books in his workshop about humans, and he read about how they sometimes use tissues to cover their mouths and noses with when they sneeze. They also use them for blowing their noses, too, apparently!\" \"Hey, cool,\" Alexander cut in. \"I might try that sometime; like during a rumpus or something. It sounds like such a nice, noisy thing to do!\" Rina laughed. \"Oh, it is, Alexander! And it's true, KW; humans do use tissues sometimes! But how could they help Judith?\" \"When someone's nose gets all stuffed up, it can sometimes make them sneeze,\" KW explained to the dark-haired little girl. Then she turned to the considerably older female Wild Thing that she sometimes butted heads with. \"Hey, Judith! You say you've tried everything, but have you tried just blowing your nose?\" \"What good would that do?\" Judith grumbled. \"KW thinks your nose is probably just all stuffed up, and that's why you're sneezing so much,\" Rina explained. She pulled the packet of tissues out of her pocket and broke the seal. \"Thank you, Dad!\" she said to herself as she did so. She took out a handful of tissues and handed them to Judith. \"Go on, Judy! You've got nothin' to lose!\" For a moment, Judith just stared st the tissues as though she didn't really know what to do with them (which she didn't). Just then, she felt another tickle in her soft, sensitive nose. She closed her eyes tightly, raised the tissues to her face, and gave a terrific sneeze. \"Aaaahhhh....AAAAAAaaaahhhhh......AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH.......AAAAAHHHHH-CHHOOOOEEEYYY!\" Rina fell backwards onto KW, and clusters of leaves fell from the trees that towered over the Wild Things. Judith gave a mighty blow into her paw-ful of tissues and then looked up. \" 'Scuse me,\" she said, blushing. Rina came over to her. \"How do you feel now, Judy? You feel better? You certainly don't sound as stuffy anymore.\" Judith looked down at Rina and flashed her one of her rare smiles. \"I feel much better now, Rina! Thank you!\" All the Wild Things breathed a sigh of relief. \"Gesundheit, Judy,\" Ira said politely to his girlfriend. Pukey had been watching this whole scene, and he glowered. \"Dangit! I had that little girl in my grasp! Well, never mind! I'll think of something else! But I'm going to infect every living creature on this lousy island or lose a half-life trying!\"[Chapter 2] Ch. 2: Pukey's First Victim Note: OOooohh, who IS Pukey's first victim? Read to find out! BTW, this chapter has lots more Wild Thing sneezes in it, so stand back! - CarolJudithFan With Judith's sneezing problem taken care of, Rina and the Wild Things set about doing what they did best: whatever came to mind. Douglas came up with the idea of showing Rina a section of their island that she'd never seen before. Everyone thought this was a great idea, and they all wanted to come. \"But I want to ride on Judith on the way to where we're going,\" Rina conditioned. Not expecting Rina to announce her preference so frankly, everyone agreed. Even Carol, who liked carrying children on top of his head. As for Judith, she was flattered and pleasantly surprised. When Rina's father had stayed with them, he had avoided Judith to the best of his ability. And on the one-and-only exchange that the two of them did have, it had quickly degenerated into a harsh laughter fight in which Judith had been left in tears. And as if that was not enough, Max made her be one of the \"bad guys\" in the dirt clod fight he'd organized not long afterward. Where did Max get this little cub from? Judith wondered as she looked at Rina. Well, she supposed it didn't really matter now. She finally had a little girl-friend to do things with and talk to. Heck, that was all she had ever wanted. \"You want to ride on me? Okay,\" Judith said to Rina as she crouched down on all fours. \"Now just climb onto my neck, swing your legs over -and try not to get your shoes in my mane, sweet pea- and hold on TIGHTLY to my horns as I stand up.\" Rina followed all these instructions and was soon up on top of Judith's head. At this new height, Rina could see far more than she could on the ground. ……………….. As the Wild Things processed to this new area that Douglas was leading them to, Judith purposely lagged behind in the back so she could talk privately with Rina. \"So, Rina, what made you decide to ride with me in particular?\" Judith asked. \"Usually, you ride with Carol or KW.\" \"I wanted to make sure you're okay,\" Rina explained. \"I want to be able to help you if you start sneezing again.\" \"Oh, you don't have to worry,\" Judith nickered. \"It was probably just a little hay fever. Douglas gets it all the time. Alex, too. I feel fine now.\" \"You promise?\" Rina asked anxiously. \"I promise. I don't even have a nose tickle,\" Judith replied. \"Oh, I'm glad,\" Rina answered gratefully. \"I don't like it when my friends feel bad.\" Would Max have felt the same way about me? Judith wondered to herself as Rina snuggled into her mane. ……………. Pukey had been following the creatures and their human friend in secret. Since all the fun had gone out of preying upon Judith, Pukey had turned his attentions to Carol. Pukey watched as Carol sniffed at some wild mistletoe and sneezed as the fuzzy, feathery pollen tickled his nose. KW snickered flirtingly. \"Gee, Carol, if mistletoe makes you sneeze, then I'll have to find something else to lure you under during Christmastime.\" Pukey was delighted. \"He's got an even more sensitive nose than Horn- Schnozz back there! No way am I passing this up!\" And he skittered over to a tree trunk that Carol was about to brush up against. As soon as Carol's furry arm made contact with the tree, Pukey leaped on and materialized into a vapor that Carol innocently sniffed up. \"Carol, be careful of what you touch out here,\" Douglas warned his friend. \"Rina has been telling me, Alexander, and Ira about the flu that the humans in her world are getting. Folks are dropping like owls hit with rocks from it\"- (KW glared at him for this) - \"and one of the ways that people catch it are from touching things! Dirty things, especially- like trees!\" \"Does this mean I can't put holes in trees anymore?\" Ira asked disappointedly. \"You could if you wanted to, Ira, but just wash your hands afterward!\" Rina advised him. Judith rolled her eyes. Ira and his holes; oh, brother. \"This flu virus that we have in my world is really serious, gang,\" Rina continued. \"It's so terrible, and it's spreading so quickly, that even schools are closing. My school hasn't closed, but whenever someone there coughs or sneezes, everyone around starts yelling, \"Oh, no!! Swine flu! Go home!!!\" I'm glad it isn't like that over here!\" Ira gave Rina a strange look. \"No, no, we don't do that here,\" he replied. Judith spoke up. \"How about that thing I do when I say that I see something on your face, and you lean forward, and then I lick you? That's one of the only tricks you fall for! I'm not giving that up!\" Rina laughed. \"I think we can still allow licking, Judy,\" she answered, patting Judith on the head. Suddenly, everyone heard something that sounded like, \"AAAaaaahhhh…..AAAAaaaaahhhhh…..\" \"Oh, no! Judith, are you going to sneeze again?\" Rina asked the Wild Thing she was riding on. \"Oh, Judy, what are we going to do with you?\" Ira asked. Judith stared at them all. \"Uuuuhhh…that's not me.\" \"Then who…\" Douglas began, and then gasped. \"Oh, no! Carol!\" \"AAAAAHHH – CHHOOOO!\" Carol sneezed, shaking some cherry blossoms loose from a tree. \"Bless YOU,\" KW said, raising her eyebrows and shaking flowers out of her long hair. \"Gee, thanks, KW,\" Carol sniffed. \"All of a sudden, I'm feeling rotten.\" \"Uh oh,\" Rina said. \"Come here,\" Douglas said to his friend, and put his paw on Carol's forehead. He sucked his breath in and jerked his paw away. \"Carol, you're burning up!\" Douglas gasped. \"AAAAHH-CHOOO! AH-CHOO, AH-CHOO, AHH-CHOOO!\" Carol went off into a sneezing fit that caused him to lose his balance and fall into a pile of autumn leaves. \"I'b sdeezig, too,\" Carol added. Rina jumped off of Judith and ran over to Carol. She tried unsuccessfully to pull him to his feet. \"Don't worry, Carol! We'll take you home!\" Rina assured him, grabbing one of his paws. Just then, Carol's eyes opened wide, he slapped his free paw over his mouth; then rolled over quickly on his side. \"BBLLLLEEEEAAAAUUUUGHHH!!!\" \"EEEEEEeeeeeeeeeWWWwwwww,\" said all the Wild Things in unison. Carol rolled over to face Rina again. \"I don't wanna go anywhere, Rina,\" he whined, like a little cub. \"I'm feeling even worse.\" \"Ohhh, poor, poor Carol,\" Rina moaned sympathetically, hugging his face. KW stepped forward. She knew how to improve this situation. Her mother had taught her everything about medicines and curatives that she needed to know. \"All right, everybody, let's make Carol as comfortable as we can. It looks like we're going to be staying here for awhile. I've got some ideas on how to make him feel better.\" Rina started rubbing Carol's belly to calm him down. \"It's gonna be okay, Carol, you'll see,\" she said. \"All your friends are here.\" She handed him a tissue.[Chapter 3] Ch. 3: KW's Idea Note: Hello! In this chapter, KW gets the idea of making some medicine for Carol (like she did for Rina in We Love You So ). Special thanx to my dad for the \"natural remedy\" idea!! - CJFan Pukey turned out to really do a number on poor Carol. The usually strong, agile, resilient beast was now sneezing, wheezing, coughing and sniffling every five minutes or so, not necessarily in that order. Everyone was distraught over how quickly Carol had taken ill, and began to banter ideas back and forth about how to help him. Ira had the first idea. \"We could try giving him healing hugs, like we do for Rina!\" Douglas shook his head. \"Ira, our healing hugs only work with flesh wounds and hurt feelings. Whatever has made Carol so sick is inside him. We could try, but the hugs can't do much with internal causes!\" \"Not even if you guys did it all at once, like a group hug?\" Rina asked. \"I'm afraid not, Rina,\" KW answered. But KW was getting an idea of her own, via a very vivid flashback.... Nighttime had fallen over the Island of the Wild Things, and the parent creatures were tucking their cubs in for the night, singing lullabies to them and washing their faces with long, slimy, tickly tongues. Dana, Carol's father, was playing one last tickle game with his ticklish little cub in order to tire him out and help him transtion to bedtime. Alexander was nursing his mother, Shanae. Bodhi, Ira's father who adopted Judith after her mother was killed, watched as his little cub and the cub he loved as though she were his own snuggle together in their sleep. Douglas' mother Roberta fluffed out her underfeathers so her son could sleep under her warm, cozy down. Daniel's mother Skye held her little bull-calf on her tummy as she rocked very gently back and forth. But Sisti, KW's mother, was having difficulties. Whenever KW lay down and tried to fall asleep, she couldn't stop coughing. Sisti was concerned because she knew her little KW was tired and wanted to sleep, but couldn't. She also knew that her cub's coughing and sniffing would keep the rest of the herd awake as well. \"Katharine, don't you feel well?\" Sisti asked KW. \"Unh- unh,\" KW answered miserably. Her little nose crinkled as she sniffled, and AAAH, AAH, CHOOO! She sneezed so hard that the tree she and Sisti slept under shed some of its leaves. Carol, who was just nodding off, heard the sneeze and looked over worriedly in KW's direction. He was sort of fond of KW, but she never paid much attention to him. But unlike Judith, she wasn't too bad for a girl - thing. Eventually, his concern lost the battle with fatigue, and he fell back asleep against his father's tummy. \"Oh, dear, little Katharine, you are sick, aren't you?\" Sisti murmured sympathetically. She gave a cursory look at the falling leaves her little cub's sneeze had shaken loose. \"Well, don't worry. I'll give you some medicine to help you sleep.\" \"Thack you, Mabba,\" KW replied stuffily. Somehow, the medicines her mother manufactured herself weren't as nasty-tasting as others. But maybe she was just biased. Within minutes, Sisti had thrown together all the necessary ingredients for the remedy - except for one. KW leaned over her mother's mortar and pestle and took a whiff of the mixture. To her relief, the soothing vapors wicked away the cruddy feeling in her nose and throat. But it wasn't fully ready for consumption yet. Her attention was diverted by her mother coaxing a squirrel out of its knothole. The squirrel obediently hopped onto Sisti's shoulder and stared at KW. \"Hi, Christopher,\" KW greeted him. Sisti then dangled the squirrel upside down by its tail as it made indignant chittering noises. \"Don't worry; they like it when you do this,\" Sisti assured her cub. KW nodded. She hoped that someday she would have the same gift of communicating with the woodland fauna that her mother had. Sisti then yanked a tuft of fur from Christopher's tail and tossed it into the mixing bowl. Christopher yowled in pain and bounded out of Sisti's clutches as fast as he could. \"Now here you go, Katharine. Drink it all down!\" Sisti urged KW. KW did as she was told, and began to feel better almost immediately. She snuggled next to Sisti and let herself fall asleep....... \"I know precisely what to do,\" KW announced, startling her friends. \"You do?\" Rina asked, clasping her hands together. If it would help Carol feel better, she would try it! KW smiled at Rina and continued, \"I'm going to make the same medicine for Carol that my mother made for me when I was a cub. But we're going to need to look for a few things first.\" \"You just say the word, and we're there, KW!\" Douglas replied eagerly. \"I'm not sure this'll work, really,\" Judith said gloomily. \"But I can't stand to see the poor fella in such a bad way. OK, I'm in.\" \"HEY, CAROL! DON'T WORRY, 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA GET YOU SOME MEDICINE!!!!\" Ira called over to Carol. Carol whimpered and covered his ears. \"Please don't yell, Ira. It makes my head hurt....Achoo!\" Note: I'll be updating soon! Haha Ira's so cute, isn't he? The \"healing hugs\" thing is actually taken from the video game for WTWTA. I don't really play VG's, but I've done some research on the WTWTA VG, and I know that much about it LOL! Actually, if there are any WTWTA fans out there who have played the VG and can tell me more about it, I'd appreciate it!

This is my first time posting in the Good Witch fandom, and I hope there are some other Good Witch fans out there. I love the show, and I'm a big fan of Catherine Bell in her role as Cassie and also in her previous role as Sarah MacKenzie in JAG. This is a Good Witch story, but there are a lot of JAG references, so it will be helpful if you're familiar with both shows. I hope you like it – thanks for reading! \"Mom, I need your help!\" Cassie Nightingale had just removed a fresh batch of blueberry muffins from the oven when she heard her daughter call out from the front door at Grey House. Worriedly setting the muffins on the counter and pulling the oven mitts from her hands, she hurried into the foyer. \"Grace, what's wrong?\" But Cassie's concern was instantly eased when she saw the twinkle in Grace's eye and the two pretty rose bouquets that she carried in each hand. \"Abigail put these together for the Double Date event tonight at the Bistro,\" Grace explained. \"But Stephanie can't decide which color to use. She wanted me to ask you.\" \"Oh, they're both so beautiful,\" Cassie proclaimed, gently touching the petals and leaning down to inhale the sweet scent. The choice consisted of either deep, vibrant red roses or bright, cheery yellow roses. Each bouquet included a dozen flowers set in a clear glass vase and framed in a bed of green leaves with sprigs of white baby's breath blossoms. \"Mom,\" Grace said sternly. \"Stephanie wants you to pick one .\" \"Well, the red rose symbolizes love, and the yellow rose symbolizes friendship,\" Cassie relayed knowledgeably. She gave Grace a little wink. \"Why don't you ask Stephanie which one she thinks would best capture the meaning of a double date?\" \"I guess I can do that.\" Grace's expression brightened. \"And I'll see you tonight, okay? Everything is going to be so romantic.\" A blush suddenly spread over Grace's face, and her voice rose a couple of pitches in excitement. \"And you know what the best part is? Noah asked me to double date with Nick and Katie.\" \"Oh, Grace, that's wonderful,\" Cassie said sincerely. \"Nick and Katie?\" \"They met on the decorating committee for the school formal,\" Grace said quickly. \"And Stephanie and Abigail are dating these guys they just met at the Bistro last week. Who's your double date going to be, Mom?\" \"Hmm.\" Cassie tilted her head thoughtfully. \"I don't know yet, but I'm sure the right match will turn up just in time…don't you agree, Sam?\" Sam was no longer surprised when Cassie knew he was there before he even arrived. He had come to expect it and discover that it was one of the many things he loved and admired about her. \"Well, I didn't quite hear what I'm agreeing to,\" Sam said, coming up behind his fiancée and greeting her with a kiss. \"But I'm assuming the answer is yes.\" Grace giggled, and Cassie gave him a secretive smile, returning his embrace with a gentle squeeze on his arm. \"Where are you off to today?\" she asked, noticing his T-shirt, sweatpants, and sneakers. \"The gym,\" Sam replied. \"I finally conned Nick into an afternoon of basketball with his old man.\" \"And what does Nick think about that?\" \"Oh, he just adores the idea,\" Sam deadpanned with a dramatic roll of his eyes. \"You'll be back in time for the Double Date event tonight, won't you?\" Grace asked. \"Of course,\" Sam assured her. \"I mean, I wouldn't want to subject Nick to too much father-son bonding all at once.\" He gave Grace a friendly smile and dropped another quick kiss on Cassie's cheek. \"I'll see you both tonight.\" ~*~o~*~ \"Come on, Dad! Where's the defense?\" Nick Radford dribbled the basketball between his legs in a nifty crossover move, sprinted around Sam, and moved in for an open lay-up, only to find himself sprawled on the gym floor after a hard shove from behind. Nick hit the ground with a loud thud as the basketball bounced carelessly out of bounds. \"Hey, Dad, that's a foul!\" \"It was not,\" Sam protested, putting his hands on his hips and panting a little from the exertion. \"What is this? You're telling me you can't handle it when the game gets a little physical?\" \"No, I'm telling you that my dad can't play defense without fouling the other team.\" \"All right, all right,\" Sam grumbled. \"Two foul shots, okay?\" Another man on the sidelines had kindly retrieved Nick's basketball from out of bounds. He had just been passing by with a gym bag and a towel with U.S. NAVY printed in big, block letters slung over his shoulder. \"Nice move,\" he said, returning the ball to Nick in a crisp bounce pass. \"Thanks.\" Nick stepped up to the foul line and swished the ball smoothly through the net, giving his father a smug look. \"You're a good dad for allowing foul shots,\" the other man remarked with a grin. \"Yeah?\" Sam asked, pleased by the compliment. \"Was your dad the kind of guy who always gave his son extra foul shots?\" \"Don't know,\" the man replied somewhat cryptically. \"Never had the chance to find out.\" Nick's second free throw bounced off the rim, and as the friendly stranger reached out for the rebound, his knee buckled underneath him and he let out a loud hiss of pain. Sam instantly transformed into the medical doctor that he was. \"Are you okay?\" he asked with concern. \"I'm a doctor. I can take a look if you'd like—\" The man grimaced as he took a few stiff-legged steps, trying to walk off the pain. \"No, that's okay, I'm fine.\" \"Looked like you might have twisted your knee pretty hard there,\" Sam said. \"If you need medical attention—\" The man waved him off. \"I'm fine. It's just an old injury, and it'll stop in a minute or two.\" He bent down to rub a specific spot on the back of his knee and his expression relaxed as the pain eased a little bit. Sam observed the man closely. \"Mind if I ask what you did to yourself?\" \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" \"I'm a doctor,\" Sam explained with a shrug. \"I've heard pretty much everything.\" \"Well, I dumped an F-14 in the drink, got my leg twisted in the chute when I hit the water, had to cut myself loose, almost drowned, then almost died of hypothermia. It was a long time ago, but my knee still likes to remind me about it every now and then.\" Sam raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"Haven't heard that one before?\" the man asked dryly. Sam laughed. \"Well, not this week at least.\" ~*~o~*~ \"Can I help you find something?\" It wasn't an unusual question for Cassie to ask her customers at Bell, Book & Candle . In fact, customers often spoke of the mysterious way that she always knew what they needed even before they did. But that afternoon, as she stood behind the counter polishing two crystal figurines, even Cassie didn't expect the next customer who entered the shop. She looked up when the bells above the front door jingled, and she found herself catching her breath in surprise. \"Good afternoon,\" she said softly. \"Good afternoon,\" her customer echoed. The two women stared at each other for a long moment, the wonder evident in their eyes as they studied the mirror image of themselves. Having never met her own reflection before, Cassie wondered just what kind of Merriwick magic was at work here. She was the first to snap herself out of the strange reverie. \"Welcome to Bell, Book & Candle ,\" she said kindly. \"Are you looking for something in particular?\" \"Oh, no, not really,\" the other woman replied. \"I was just passing by and something drew me into your shop. I—I can't really explain it.\" \"Ah, well, sometimes magic doesn't always reveal its explanation,\" Cassie quoted wisely. With one last swipe of her polishing cloth, she set the two crystal figurines down on the counter. The tiny pair of birds shimmered, almost creating the illusion of flight as their golden-tipped wings caught the sunlight at just the right angle. \"Those are beautiful,\" the other woman said admiringly. \"Are they turtledoves?\" \"They are,\" Cassie confirmed. \"Handmade by a young, artistic friend of mine. She says that turtledoves symbolize true love and devotion. If they're ever separated, they can always find their way back to each other. Sometimes all we need to fly are a pair of gold wings.\" The woman laughed. \"Please don't ever tell that to my husband.\" Cassie smiled warmly. \"I don't think you'll find anyone more devoted to you than your husband.\" Gracefully, she lifted the turtledoves from the counter and placed them in the other woman's hand. \"For both of you.\" \"Oh, no, I couldn't—\" The woman immediately started to protest, but Cassie held up her hand. \"Consider them a gift. Let me see if I have a box for you. I'll be right back.\" \"Yoohoo!\" The bells above the front door jingled again, and a shrill voice carried across the shop as a familiar customer made her way past the herbs, spices, and other trinkets until she reached the counter. \"Cassie! Oh, Cassie, I desperately need your help. As you know, the inaugural Double Date event is tonight, and as the Mayor of Middleton, I'm supposed to make a speech—\" Martha Tinsdale stopped abruptly as the woman at the counter turned to face her. She had Cassie's kind, beautiful face and chocolate brown eyes, but her dark hair was tightly tied back, and she wore the green uniform of a military officer, complete with ribbons and insignia. \"My goodness, Cassie,\" Martha exclaimed. \"Wherever did you get that uniform?\" \"It's standard dress for the U.S. Marine Corps, ma'am.\" \"Ma'am?\" Martha repeated, laughing heartily as the word rolled off her tongue. \"Oh, Cassie, when did we become so formal?\" \"Hello, Martha.\" \"Cassie!\" Martha let out a loud yelp as Cassie appeared beside her, carrying a small velvet box. \"Oh, my,\" Martha gasped, holding a hand to her chest in surprise. Her eyes darted back and forth between the two women standing at the counter. \"Am I—am I seeing double?\" \"Well, there does seem to be a slight resemblance,\" Cassie remarked. \"A resemblance…oh, um, I see…\" Martha nervously straightened the scarf around her neck and shook her head, as if that would make one of the two women disappear. \"Well, as I was saying…Cassie, I desperately need your help. I'm supposed to make a speech about romance and true love at the Double Date event tonight, but I don't know what on earth I'm going to say.\" \"Well, I'm sure you'll think of something,\" Cassie said with a reassuring smile. \"You always do.\" Martha frowned. \"Yes, but this time I'm supposed to talk about how Tom and I keep our romance alive even while he's in Chicago. He's so far away all the time, but he loves his work, and I don't want to take that away from him, but I miss him so much.\" She paused as she heard a soft chuckle, and Martha narrowed her eyes suspiciously at the Cassie twin. \"I'm sorry,\" the woman apologized. \"But I think you have your opening statement right there. When you're meant to be with someone, even when that someone is far away, it doesn't mean that you stop loving them. And sometimes,\" she added wistfully, \"if you love someone enough, you have to let them do what they love…even if what they love most is landing twenty tons of steel on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean.\" There was a long moment of silence as Martha blinked owlishly, rendered unusually speechless. Cassie just grinned. \"Well, Martha, I don't think I could have said it any better myself.\" ~*~o~*~ \"Wow, Stephanie, the place looks great,\" Cassie exclaimed as she and Sam entered the Bistro later that night. She almost didn't recognize one of their favorite restaurants in Middleton, as the regular lights had been dimmed and replaced with romantic candlelight and each table was set with four places, red tablecloths, and floral centerpieces made of intertwined red and yellow roses. Stephanie's smile was genuine. \"Well, thank you,\" she said. \"And Cassie, I hear that I have you to thank for suggesting both the red and yellow roses. I don't know what I was thinking…this is a double date event, and we should have double the roses, right?\" She motioned towards one of the buffet tables. \"So please come in, take a seat anywhere, try the complimentary hors d'oeuvres, and enjoy a little romance.\" Cassie turned to Sam with a shy smile that brought a faint blush to her cheeks. \"Shall we?\" Sam returned her smile and took his fiancée's arm in a grand, romantic gesture. \"I think we shall.\" As the couple made their way further into the Bistro, they waved to Grace and Nick who were chatting animatedly with their friends. Cassie pretended not to notice her daughter holding hands with Noah, and she was pleased to see smiles on everyone's faces. \"It's nice to see Grace and Nick getting along again,\" she whispered in Sam's ear. \"Well, it's about time,\" Sam muttered in response. \"For my speech? Already?\" Cassie and Sam exchanged a knowing look at the sound of that unmistakable voice. \"Martha,\" Cassie greeted pleasantly. Her smile widened as she noticed the man accompanying her. \"And Tom, you made it.\" \"Well, Martha talked me into it,\" Tom said with a sheepish smile. \"Besides, how could I possibly say no to a romantic double date with my wife?\" Just then, two other young adults approached the group and Cassie instantly recognized them. \"Michael, Vanessa, it's good to see you both again.\" \"Hi, Cassie. Hi, Sam,\" Martha's son said politely, and his recent bride Vanessa echoed the greeting. \"Oh, isn't it marvelous?\" Martha exclaimed, clasping her hands together with happiness. \"My whole family is here to share this special event. Cassie, I guess there's something to be said for what your evil twin told me earlier today.\" Martha paused to reconsider her choice of words. \"Well, I guess she's not actually your 'evil' twin. In fact, she seems very nice and she and her husband look positively radiant together tonight.\" Martha motioned to two guests on the other side of the room, and Cassie caught a glimpse of a brown-haired woman in a red dress, accompanied by a tall, dark-haired man in a gray suit and tie. \"Oh, well, we'll have to go say hello.\" \"Of course,\" Martha agreed. \"Tom, Michael, Vanessa, let's go find a table so you have a perfect view of the podium for my speech.\" She grasped her husband's hand firmly and herded her family away towards some of the empty seats. \"Evil twin?\" Sam murmured under his breath once Martha was out of earshot. \"There's a slight resemblance,\" Cassie admitted. As Sam and Cassie approached the other couple, the woman had her back turned to them, but they could clearly see the tall man come up behind his wife, wrap an arm around her waist, and press a soft kiss to the back of her neck. Recognition dawned on Sam after a moment. \"Cassie, I think that's the guy Nick and I met playing basketball this afternoon.\" Sam craned his neck, but he still couldn't quite see the wife's face, as she had just moved away while making a selection of hors d'oeuvres. He saw her lay a hand on her husband's arm and lean in to whisper in his ear. Just then, the man turned slightly and happened to catch Sam's eye. \"Hey, it's the dad who never fouls,\" he said with a grin. Sam chuckled. \"That's me. How's the knee?\" \"Oh, it's fine. Like I said, it's just an old injury.\" \"Well, it's nice to see you again,\" Sam said, extending his hand politely. \"Sam Radford. This is my fiancée, Cassie Nightingale.\" As the man's gaze fell upon Cassie, his bright blue-green eyes clouded over in confusion. Cassie also stared at him intently, and there was a long silence and an uncomfortable shift in the air. \"You two know each other?\" Sam asked, sensing the unusual tension. It took a moment for the man to find his voice again, and he swallowed hard before he spoke. \"No, I'm sorry, I just…had a moment of déjà vu.\" Sam frowned, a little puzzled by his reaction. \"Sorry, I didn't catch your name earlier this afternoon?\" Still appearing slightly dazed, the man shook Sam's hand, his other arm reaching out to rest on his wife's lower back and redirect her attention. \"Mac,\" he murmured softly, prompting her to turn around in his arms. Now it was Sam's turn to take a stunned step backwards. \"Harmon Rabb,\" the man finally introduced himself, \"and this is my wife, Sarah MacKenzie.\" ","Summary":" Hi, everyone! This is my first time posting in the Good Witch fandom, and I hope there are some oth"},{"Movie":"Good Witch","Title":"Realization","Author":"Rangerbaldwin","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13074745","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author: Lynda M. Author's note: See my profile for a special Good Witch fan group announcement on Facebook! Summary/Timeframe: Season 2/3, after the Festival of Lights and during the time Dr. Radford and Ms. Nightingale are realizing a few things. Where was Sam? Why is Cassie so drawn to him? Realization Doctor Sam Radford sat down on the staff cot slowly, noticing that, as always, the height of the frame seemed to be geared toward 5-year-olds, and not adults. After losing a patient during emergency surgery, he did not know if he COULD sleep, and also knew he NEEDED to lie down. The loss shook him. The doctor felt defeated, and did not expect to sleep but his body gave in quickly to the offer of rest. Sam woke suddenly and consulted his watch. Forty-five minutes of rest, and he was as awake and clear headed as if he had slept for eight straight hours. He had not dreamed and his patient's death was still a fresh memory. \"I need to get out of here,\" he told himself. Pulling out his phone, which was silenced hours ago, he turned it off. He needed to process what had happened. Time to drive. He would grab a coffee on the way out as a keep awake assist. Finding a place midway between home and the hospital, Sam turned off the Jeep in the empty parking lot and sat, thinking. He was the expert, the surgeon, the hero of the emergency room. Sam had always won or achieved at whatever he set his mind upon. This patient was to have been no different. Something went wrong, and then something else. Sam thought he had the patient stable and there was another complication. The memory of the surgery played back in the doctor's mind; every move in slow motion. Finally, it was too late, and the patient was just. . . . gone. Sam started from the beginning playing it out in his head again. And again. Frustratingly, he could not pinpoint exactly where he went wrong, only that the turn for the worse was a sudden one. He could not bear to go home. His practice in Middleton was nothing like the adrenaline rush of the hospital emergency room. Sam was, deliberately, in family medicine since leaving New York. Sniffles, arthritis, laryngitis and diagnostics were his day-to-day dealings. Until tonight, he had enjoyed the fast paced challenge of returning to the ER. He had missed that rush. Until tonight. There was nothing to miss about losing a patient. Right before starting the Jeep to go home, Sam remembered that he had turned off his mobile phone. Not something he usually did, because his son Nick might need something. Nick had friends, more than a year after moving in next door to Grey House. The boy was clever, and he understood what his father did for a living, so he could take care of himself for a few hours. If there was a problem, Nick knew who he should call. Sam was supposed to meet Cassie at the festival the night before, but he never did. Before looking at the phone for confirmation, he knew that she had called, and left at least one voice message. It was her way of being his friend – although to think about it, they were something more than friends by now. Having listened to all five of Cassie's messages, and also reviewing the one text message from Nick, Sam started the Jeep. Nick and Cassie were both worried. His son had school in the morning. Better let him sleep. Sam felt it was too late, make that early - barely sun up - to call Cassie back. Besides, she would probably be . . . Waiting for him when he arrived home, and there she was. He could see her ahead, giving a little wave and then folding her arms across her chest in the cold morning air. She never took her eyes off him as he parked. He was going to have to pay the piper, now. Only, with Cassie Nightingale, it never felt like you were. Today, even if it felt like he was paying for standing her up last night, it would be worth it. This was the reason he did not mind, nay, he HOPED she would be waiting for him. Even though his mood was not good, at all; even though he had not returned her calls or apologized to her. He was hurting from his failure, but seeing her reminded him that not all was lost. ** GW ** \"Yep, that went about how I thought it would,\" Sam told his empty bedroom. Nick had left for school a while before, and Sam was glad he could try to get real rest, in the comfort of his own home. He finished dressing in casual clothes, suitable for a nap and climbed into bed. He considered his most recent conversation with his next-door neighbor. The softness in her voice when she said his name and the calm confirmation that she was certain he had done his utmost – those things made him want to be honest with her, and he was. He told her he was ripped up from the inside out, and before he knew it, she was giving him condolences. She made him feel better, at least a little, and she didn't have to. He knew she meant every word. Cassie always did. He failed to consider how persistent Cassie could be when she wanted to spend time with him. She had the words, the tea, and even, the offer of silence. He was tempted, very tempted. Still, Sam kept his decision firm. He had the night shift tonight, and rest was required for him to be alert later. Not tea. The firm answer to her offer was no. He didn't like how he had expressed his desire to be alone, but there it was again. He, Sam, was only human, and not perfect. Also, he was falling in love with her. He knew that as certain as he knew his heart kept beating and the sun was shining. Who wouldn't love Cassie Nightingale? Her spirit was as beautiful as her body. It's too soon for that , he told himself, you can love her, but you can't fall hopelessly, romantically in love. No way. Get a little distance. Throw yourself into your work. That's the answer right now. The only answer. Be her friend. Give her time and space, too. You're both raising teenagers on your own. Don't rush. On the other hand, you know Cassie. She's going to keep surprising you. That's her way. Her Cassie-ness. If it's meant to be, she'll get into your heart; and you'll get into hers. He still had to convince himself to sleep for a while. Five or six hours would be do the trick. Then up and at 'em, he told himself. Lying on his bed in the morning sun, Sam closed his eyes, to at least think. He was a good doctor. Top of his class, as he liked to brag. He would get back up on the horse, and put in more time at the hospital – volunteer for time he didn't have to put in. He'd prove to himself he was still at the top by seeing more patients, and saving every one. No one else would die on Sam's watch. He would see less of Cassie, although he was sure he would see her some. This would solve two issues at once. He'd be a great doctor again, and his and Cassie's relationship, as it were, would slow down. Sam fell asleep. He didn't know it, but he was smiling. ** GW ** Cassie woke from a doze in the chair before the fireplace. The fire was long gone, although light orange embers still burned. She looked at the face of the grandfather clock across the room. Three in the morning. No Sam, yet. She didn't have a feeling for him at the moment. In fact, all she felt was the usual calm of the house. She considered making a cup of tea, but decided against it, instead relocating to the loveseat. The embers did not need tending in the fireplace. She leaned over on her right side and stared at the orange glow, wondering what kept Sam, and hoping he was all right. Since the single father had moved in next door, he had been an unexpected surprise and a nice change of pace from her previous daily routines. His frequent visits to borrow food or sit and enjoy company had turned from neighborly to friendly to more than friends. How much more? Was she ready? Cassie did not have the answers, and that was all right. Keeping their friendship as simply that made it easy for her to welcome and encourage without reading more into her handsome neighbor. Sam had seemed eager earlier in the week to see her at the light festival. In fact, they were in the midst of seriously considering becoming a couple. Had Sam changed his mind on that? The fact that he had no showed to the festival and had not contacted her was troublesome. Also, it did nothing to mitigate the odd feeling she had yesterday, when she asked him to be careful. Without noticing, Cassie drifted to sleep again. ** GW ** Cassie awoke to the feeling that Sam was nearby. The glow in the fireplace was completely gone, and the clock read seven a.m. The sun was rising, beginning to lift the misty remainders of the evening before. It would not take her fifteen minutes to freshen up, change clothes, and be ready to greet him when he stepped out of the Jeep. ** GW ** After Grace left for school, Cassie sat outside alone with a cup of tea, pondering the day ahead. She was not really expecting guests, but she had that old feeling. And there was Sam. She had tried with him, and now she understood, a little, what he was going through. \"Ah, Sam,\" Cassie said aloud to whatever fauna and flora might listen in, \"You're a tricky one.\" When she saw him a little while ago, he looked terrible – exhausted and pale. She could not hide her annoyance with him until he explained the situation last night. Not that someone dying made her feel any better, that was a tragedy, of course. She was earnestly sorry for what he had been through. Cassie believed such transparency with him led him to tell her more than he planned on saying about it. She yearned to help him past the pain, but he flatly denied her help. Cassie saw why Sam was upset, but for himself, well, he would have to come to certain realizations. One such was that even a top notch surgeon could not control life. Nor could he control death. No matter how much it was his desire. Sam had withdrawn from her a few minutes ago. At least he had talked. Cassie was well aware that if she had not been standing in the drive when her neighbor pulled in and parked, that he would have gone inside the house without a word. He owed her an explanation, and had given it to her. He was hurting, and he needed to cope with the guilt and pain in his way. Cassie recognized that Sam was dealing with something only he could deal with. That was why she offered him both tea and silence. He didn't want to do it her way, and she accepted that. One trait that attracted her to him was that he was not easily swayed to others' opinions and ideas, and he stuck up for his own. At the same time, he respected that she did things her way, too, and he was not out to make her change. Her mind circled once more to her early morning questions. How much more than friends had her relationship with Sam become? The kisses were nice, and a part of her longed for more. Another part of her wanted to keep things the way they were at the moment, in stone. Although that was impossible, because the passage of time meant something was going to change, most likely. The other question came into play. Was she ready for her relationship to change? When Sam first moved next door, Cassie was only friends with Ryan Elliot. Things were drastically fast tracked by the realtor's desperation to show up his ex-fiancée, and Cassie's desire to help her friend stand up to someone who was an absolute jealous control monger. Kissing Ryan had never generated a romantic spark, and both she and Ryan knew that it had been for show. Nothing like what she'd had with Jake. A few weeks passed, and Ryan was pushing her to date him. Oddly, the very same day she told Ryan she was not ready to move on, her heart had changed in Sam's favor . . . which was unfortunately illustrated to Ryan that night. The realtor did not walk in, although the shop door was unlocked. He walked away, downtrodden and friend zoned. There was John Dover, too. Surprisingly, he had been easier to say no to romantically than Ryan. Cassie was overjoyed when she found out John had a long distance girlfriend, but that broke up overnight. Still, John was handsome, and in a way she could see herself with him, traveling the world from dig to dig. The timing was off, she decided. Grace was years from adulthood, and Cassie did not want to leave her behind, or tear her daughter from everything and everyone she knew. The fact remained that change was inevitable. Cassie felt ready with Sam. The attraction was there; had been there since the Heritage Ball, really. Well before their near-miss kiss at Bell Book. In the same spot where Jake had first kissed her. Sam was courteous – he hated interrupting her when she was due to spend time with Ryan, and he'd encouraged her to fly off to the Maldives. He couldn't have known that Middleton had a strong grip on her, along with her family. Sam always encouraged, but never pushed. When Sam planted a kiss on her lips at the lake house, the electric charge between them was something rare. She hadn't told Sam, but there was a slight whisper in the air when their lips parted that originated from neither of them. Cassie knew it was Jake, giving her his blessing to move on. Shortly after the kiss, Sam and she had driven back to Middleton. Not silently, but both of them actively avoiding discussion of the kiss. They both knew they could have gone a lot further than that kiss, alone by the lake, but there was an unspoken, mutual agreement to put on the brakes. For the moment. And now. . . The ball, was squarely in Sam's court. Until she could spend more time with him, she would not know what his exact desires and intentions were. She thought she had a pretty good idea, and it was backed up by her Merrywick intuition, but that intuition did not have the final say. \"Best not to rush,\" Cassie said out loud, and then sipped her tea. It was almost gone. Best not to rush when, for the moment, her relationship with Sam was fine. He needed more time to get through losing his patient. Her relationship with her daughter was fine as well. Since losing Jake, Cassie had cherished her time with Grace, watching her blossom into an intelligent, caring young woman. \"Best not to rush.\" Cassie said again, finishing the tea and smiling. She stood and breathed deeply of the morning air. You never know, Dr. Sam Radford may surprise you yet. ","Summary":" Author: Lynda M.

She tugged at the damp towel around her shoulders and hunched into it further, focusing on breathing in the night's cool air. Grace sighed in content. Something about the night just calmed her, the fresh outdoors soothing her worries—or trying their best. She lived primarily in one of two states: quiet peace, or subtle anxiety. She absolutely adored Sam's lake house—her lake house? Her mom's?—and it could act all it wanted that she was in the peace stage, but it couldn't successfully hide the truth from her. Summer was coming to a close. Which, normally, would stir up excitement for what the new school year held. But things were different this year. After summer ended, she wouldn't be coming home to Grey House every day to do her homework and help Cassie with chores and whatever guest's lives they had magically become a part of. She wouldn't be happily swamped with extracurricular activities and bursting to arrange a date with Noah. None of that would be happening, because she wasn't going to Middleton High anymore. Graduating had been bittersweet. Every molecule of her being was psyched to continue with life and see what she would find, but her brain just wouldn't let up on all she was leaving behind. It constantly nagged at her that choosing a university out of state had been a huge mistake, and that maybe she should just take a gap year and stay in town. Whether staying in town would strictly be for the year off or if it would end up being long-term to further her education, she didn't know. But she didn't want to—no no, she wasn't going to let up on her decision. Someone had once told her she would never leave Middleton, and if this not only proved him wrong but also took her away from him, then she wasn't going back. Not to say her pick of universities had been entirely shaped because of him, but it was just a tad influenced— Grace's back stiffened as her breath caught, simultaneously thankful for and cursing her 'feelings.' Speak of the Devil… She considered calling out his name like she used to, but that was reserved for her friends, and she doubted he'd appreciate it now anyway. But still—what was he doing here? She knew the simple answer. He was Sam's son, her step-brother, and he'd been at the lake house with their new family all summer long. As to why he had come out onto the back porch at eleven at night when it was clear she was the only one out there, she didn't know. They hadn't had a real conversation in over a year. She felt rather than heard his footsteps move closer, wondering if she should say something first. \"I was going to shower.\" His voice was empty, almost monotone, and she couldn't tell if he was irritated or just stating a fact. She started to clear her throat then stopped. Grace straightened her spine and spoke into the open air, \"Sorry if I used up all the water.\" It figured he'd come out to complain to her about her late-night shower. It wasn't her fault he hadn't planned better around her schedule, having known she and her mom were going kayaking and then thrift and antique shopping all day and that she wouldn't be back until late. Of course she was going to shower when she got home. He could have accommodated to her needs just once. \"You didn't,\" he replied, granting her a little emotion in his words. His bare feet made a dull sound as they moved forward, stopping when he dropped into the lawn chair a few feet adjacent her. He tossed two large t-shirts onto the porch floor, a squelching noise sounding as soon as they hit the wood. She caught his raised eyebrow. \"Just took the last towel.\" Her nose wanted to wrinkle playfully, but, one) it would be unwanted, and two) her eyes were stuck on his hair. They might not have been talking-talking, but she saw him more times in one day than she'd ever seen him before this past summer, and she thought she was fairly well-versed in his hair style. Last year he had grown it out a bit more, making her grateful for what she thought was temporary time apart; she really didn't prefer the length. But now, in the faint light from the sunroom that the porch was set off of, it looked different to her. \"Did you cut your hair?\" she asked, the words out before she was aware she was going to say them. They rarely ever started this kind of conversation anymore, and she feared his reaction for a split-second before she grasped the situation. This was small talk. She had asked about his hair, not his deepest fears. He nodded once, pausing only slightly before saying, \"Yeah. I...wanted a change.\" Whoa, whoa; was that code? \"A change?\" Again, she didn't realize she was speaking aloud. Grace cringed. \"For college?\" she added, just because it sounded better. Not like what her stupidly optimistic brain was thinking. There was a pause again, and she was sure she felt his eyes on her arms. \"Sure. I guess.\" This was physically painful. All of his sentences sounded like a bad script reading where the actor just wasn't into the scene. Another gust of wind hit her so she would shiver. She pulled the towel tighter around her body, face firmly staying pointed out to the dock. \"Are you cold?\" \"No.\" She was. But only a little, and she could handle it, just like she'd handled the past year and a half without him. Great. Now she was frowning. \"What time is it?\" she asked quietly, voice coming out much more timid than she intended. \"Grace, I didn't bring out my phone.\" \"I didn't notice, Nick.\" She wanted nothing more than to close her eyes and scream. Who were they? \"Right. You were too busy not looking at me.\" Okay, she scoffed at that, the urge to close her eyes lessening as the one to scream increased. \"Oh, I apologize. Did you want me to do that thing where I announce your presence before you do? I'm sure you'd just love that.\" It was almost as if she could sense him tensing up. \"Do whatever you want, Grace. Nothing you say affects me.\" That stung, and she could tell he knew it by the breath he sucked in directly after. Grace shifted in her seat and let a corner of her towel slide down her arm an inch. They were engulfed by silence for a moment, and she wondered why he didn't just get up and leave. Or why he had stayed in the first place. She wouldn't have. The only time they were alone in the same room was when they set the table each night for dinner, and that was more for their façade than any burning desire to be around each other. Or, at least that's what she told herself. She wasn't sure what it was like on his end. Something about him being just a couple feet out of her reach was getting to her. They used to greet each other with wide smiles and open arms, or no greeting at all when they'd spent the day together. They'd kill hours and days upon days hanging out, her tutoring and teaching him how to cook, him driving them around to parties and her academic decathlon matches if only to make faces at her from the crowd. It was part of the reason why, the April after their fight, when Noah sat her down to discuss breaking things off, she'd been okay with it. She was miserable without Nick, and Noah could tell. He didn't think she was upset about losing a friend anymore. He thought it was something else, something she didn't want to delve into, and so they broke up. She wasn't anywhere near as devastated about the breakup as she was about their fight, and it was that thought that stuck with her through the year and the entirety of Cassie and Sam's wedding, even though, try as she might, she wanted it to go away. Like she needed anymore regretful thoughts. \"What do you want?\" she blurted, twisting in her seat to face him head-on. The towel slid down her arm more. He blinked for a moment. \"Wha—I just wanted to come outside for a second.\" She didn't even say anything. He huffed and ran a hand through his wet hair (something her eyes were drawn to, yet again), continuing, \"I don't know, I guess...part of me kind of wanted to talk before we go our separate ways.\" \"Our separate...\" She knew what he was referring to, but seriously? It had taken him this long to reach this point? She reached it again and again every single day! \"Nick, we've al ready gone our separate ways! What do you think the past eighteen months have been?\" she questioned, hands flying to convey her burst of emotion. His jaw dropped and stayed there for a moment before he could speak again. \"You—we had an agreement, alright? Stop acting like this is my fault, we knew what we were doing—\" \"You're the one who was so dead set on faking everything instead of actually trying to work things out, okay?\" Grace pointed out, one hand gripping the chair's arm. \"That was you, not me!\" \"Well it's not like you tried to challenge me on that front!\" \"Because I was letting you make your own decisions, Nick!\" she countered, eyebrows drawing together in her frustration. She could tell he knew where she was going with this. \"I've been trying to evolve because I've been beating myself up for the past year and a half over some shitty things you said to me, and I wanted to be a better version of myself, okay? Can you say you've done the same? Can you honestly say that?\" She expected him to throw the jab at his narcissistic tendencies right back in her face, to poke and prod at her until they were having another screaming match and storming off in different directions. Instead, all he did was stare at her, eyes soft with astonishment. \"Did you just swear?\" He regarded her in awe openly, the expression akin to how he looked when he comforted her when she was sad. When he said she was unique, and her heart had threatened to flutter its wings and leave for good. Grace didn't know what he meant at first, and then she realized she had, in fact, cursed. And that's all he was focusing on. The latter annoyed her further, and she placed her arms across her chest, the towel barely hanging onto her frame. \"Yes, I suppose I did. Teenagers cuss, okay?\" \"But you don't.\" That was only partially true, because when they were friends, she didn't. That was left up to him. And it pushed another button of hers knowing that the bad habit had likely developed from her subconscious need to be close to him, to have some kind of connection. \"How would you know?\" Her eyes crinkled as soon as she said it. She hadn't been prepared to argue over this tonight. She'd been trying to accustom herself to her Nick-less life, as she had been for awhile now, and this was almost a burden. Almost. If nothing else, her chest would thank her for the weight this was lifting. \"This is a two-way street, alright? You don't know everything that's going on with me either.\" He shook his head. \"God. You're just as pushy as before.\" \"You mean caring? Because I'm not.\" She tried to cinche her arms closer together, but the towel felt uncomfortable and she ripped it off completely, angrily tossing it down onto the pile of t-shirts. \"Not anymore,\" she finished, arms back over her chest. \"To you, at least.\" \"Caring is like knowing what college I'm going to, not shoving your opinions down my throat as always,\" he retorted, his chair making a loud screeching noise when he turned toward her more. Her eyes were crackling as she leaned forward. \"You're going to Middleton, Nick! Which is exactly what you've bitched at me about!\" The chair scooted back at he got to his feet in a flash, body looming over hers. For a nanosecond he seemed dumbfounded, undoubtedly from her vulgarity. \"People change, Grace! I'm not the same guy I was when I yelled at you about that!\" Grace stood up as well and uncrossed her arms, clenching her fists at her sides. \"No shit! So maybe you should stop acting like I'm still that pretentious know-it-all who only wants the best for you because, trust me, I don't care anymore!\" False. So completely, utterly, unbelievably false, and he still looked like he'd been punched in the gut. Her face flared up and she wondered if the house's lighting would catch that. \"Wait,\" she said quietly, hoping she could backtrack. \"That's not what I meant.\" How could he think that was what she meant? How many times had she been lying in bed and heard a car door slam around three am, and her heart would speed up? How many times had she climbed out of bed and carefully drawn the curtains open just enough to see him in his driveway? How many times had she mumbled quiet prayers thanking God that he wasn't drunk and that he was alive and well and had made it home? How many times had she wanted to yell out the window, to talk to him, to fling herself into his arms just so the feel of them around her wasn't merely a memory? She shouldn't have said it, but he shouldn't have believed it. Her mind had been chalk full of him for so long, with so many worries for him, overflowing with wishes for smiles and reconciliations that it was absolutely in sane he hadn't realized any of it. \"No, that's exactly what you meant,\" he supplied, eyes betraying the hurt his body wouldn't show. He stumbled back a step. \"The tables have turned on us, huh? I'm the recluse afraid to leave home and you're the self-centered prick?\" She'd heard him swear before; plenty of times. While watching movies, when meeting obstacles while driving, during their old tutoring sessions—especially those. This wasn't the first time she'd heard that word, not even close, but this was the first time such a word was directed at her, and to specifically wound her too. She stepped forward to fix the gap he had created. \"Do not call me that.\" He was breathing heavily. \"Then don't act like one!\" \"Don't force my hand when you won't be a man and just break up with your girlfriend!\" He made an indignant noise, eyebrows shooting up. \"I never asked you to do that! I was going to break up with her, but just because it wasn't according to your schedule—\" \"Because it made! No! SENSE!\" she exclaimed, coming farther into his personal space. \"You were letting Courtney make plans with you to go to parties and tell me about double dates we'd be having, and I had to listen to her get excited about her boyfriend—her supposedly loving boyfriend,\" she said pointedly, almost glaring but not quite at him, \"who's taking her out on dates and listening to her stories and being a super sweet guy! And I knew that none of that was true.\" He stared down at her, shaking his head. \"It wasn't the right time.\" She nearly laughed. \"You're kidding. Not the right ti—\" \"It wasn't!\" he cut in, angrily locking eyes with her. \"I don't care what you say; there are timely ways to go about shit like that, and you weren't letting me—\" \"You were never going to do it!\" \"I couldn't do it when we were on a date, Grace!\" he yelled, chest almost touching hers when he moved forward. \"You're acting as if there's a good time to do that!\" she said forcefully, stretching to her full height against him. \"Kids?\" a voice called out from inside the house, and Grace's pulse spiked. \"Mom,\" she mouthed at the same time his lips formed the word, \"Cassie.\" It would have been the perfect chance to split off and let their argument simmer down, but Grace looked out to the dock and jerked her head towards it once. He nodded gruffly and they maneuvered around the wet towel and makeshift towels, hopping over the four porch steps and speed-walking down to the dock. \"There's this thing,\" Grace began again, huffing slightly, \"I don't know if you've heard, called sitting someone down. You should've done that. THAT is how you break up with someone.\" \"Nuh-uh, no,\" he disagreed, head shaking. \"That's just your experience with Noah. I don't care if he bought you a bouquet of roses and gave you a handcrafted heartfelt letter summarizing what your relationship was like—\" \"Not that it's any of your business,\" she prefaced, relieved to see they were nearing the dock at a steady pace, \"but he sat me down and we talked, like adults, about what we should do next and why were breaking up, and it was fine, Nick. And e ffective.\" She whipped her head to the side to glare at him. \"What happened, anyway? He get sick of your controlling attitude, too?\" he spat, eyes locked on the water. Her mouth opened and closed and she didn't know what to do because that was sucha far, far cry from the truth that once again she felt like screaming. She came to a stop at the end of the dock and turned to face him, expression open and laying all of her emotions out on the line. \"No, because not every person who gets close to me feels the need to rip my heart out,\" she seethed, unsure of how angry she actually sounded when the truth was still so raw. He finally dragged his eyes away from the water to fix her with an appalled look. \"I was hurt too, Grace! You weren't the only one hurt! You broke up with my girlfriend!\" \"You were going to break up with her anyway!\" she yelled incredulously. \"I can't believe you're still bringing that up as if it's definitive proof I was in the wrong!\" \"I was dating her!\" \"You didn't even like her anymore!\" \"I never liked her to begin with!\" If she didn't remember they were surrounded by water, she would have taken a step back. Her eyebrows furrowed and her thoughts slowed. \"What?\" He seemed to think he had made an error because he did take a step back and divert his eyes. \"What?\" Grace shook her head back and forth as she tried to catch his eye. \"Whoa, whoa, you just said you never liked Courtney.\" \"No I didn't.\" \"You didn't even like her and yet you asked her out and…\" She trailed off, a thought occurring to her and trying its best to work up her fury again. \"Your argument is even more invalid! Why are you still mad at me when you didn't care about Courtney?\" He barely glanced at her, but she still caught the look her gave her. \"I have a lot to be angry about, Grace.\" She let that slip by. \"Why were you dating her, Nick? Why'd you ask her out?\" He was quiet for so long that she didn't expect him to answer at all. When he did, it was in a low voice. \"You know when you do things without thinking them through, kind of spontaneously?\" She blinked. \"That's not what happened.\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Nick, that's not what you did!\" Thoughts started bombarding her, trying to put the pieces together. She knew he was lying, but what did he have to gain from that? So many details of his time with Courtney were burnt into her memory both before and after they were officially dating, and she knew his statement was off. \"Trust me, it is.\" But her mind wasn't fully there in the moment with him anymore, and she started thinking out loud. \"But you were asking me for advice—\" \"Grace, no—\" \"You picked her flowers—\" \"Whatever you're about to say, don't—\" This didn't make sense. None of this made sense. \"That's why you asked me to tutor you, so you could ask to talk the next day—\" His forced-nonchalant tone changed to frantic, if only by a little switch in volume. \"Grace just stop , seriously—\" Something was ringing in the back of her mind and she wanted to go after it, unaware of where it would lead her. \"The tutoring, the talk, the flowers; Nick, you had it all planned out!\" she exclaimed, whipping her now mostly-dry hair around in his direction. \"You were going to ask Courtney out—\" \"I was going to ask someone out!\" he snapped, eyes staring into the depth of hers. Her gaze flickered over his face, brain not making the connection right away. \"Yeah, and that was Court…\" She felt her expression drop just as it clicked. He was still looking at her, pain very evident on his face as she realized what he'd always known. \"Oh, my God,\" she whispered, hand rising to cover her mouth as she looked elsewhere. \"Yeah,\" he said, mimicking her hushed tone. He turned away. Grace could've sworn her face was burning up tremendously as she silently lined everything up. Stephanie might have had little luck in guessing whom Cassie romanticized, but she was a hundred percent right about Nick. She'd read all the signs correctly, and in the end Grace had brushed them aside, and… \"Oh my God, and you—when you tried to,\" she fumbled, the hand hovering in front of her mouth. \"You tried to tell me and I just freaked out…\" The moon was shining around his head like a halo, a dark contrast to how he looked like he currently felt. \"Yeah, you did. But it doesn't really matter now, so…\" He wasn't meeting her eyes. Just then did she grasp the full extent of this situation. This wasn't just some guy saddened by her accidental rejection. This wasn't just Nick Radford, her ex-best friend that she still loved with all her heart. This was Nick Radford, her step-brother, the guy she hadn't talked to like this for over a year, the guy who occupied most of her thoughts, the guy she seriously didn't want as her step-brother, because that made everything so much harder. \"Is...are you mad at me about that?\" she questioned, hand pressed firmly against her mouth and cheek now as she sheepishly looked at him. When they made eye contact, he seemed so sincere. \"Grace…I would never be mad at you about something like that.\" The tenderness that seeped into his voice made her want to cry. \"I mean, yeah, it sucked of course, but—I got it.\" She wondered if he really did, because it had torn her apart. \"If it makes you feel any better, I was really conflicted afterwards,\" she admitted, partially laughing towards the end. One of his eyebrows rose. \"Wait, what do you mean conflicted?\" She bit her lip before beginning. \"Well, it's just that when Courtney came to my house and recounted how she turned you down, she kind of—\" \"Said she thought we had something, yeah.\" He sounded very, very tired suddenly. \"I know. She told me your reaction—in depth, by the way—and how it was 'all a miscommunication.'\" She could practically hear the air quotes, and it pained her just thinking about it. Grace cringed. \"Yeah, that screwed with my head. After she left, I...honestly didn't know if I did the right thing.\" She lifted her eyes and was surprised to find him looking back at her. \"So I'm sorry,\" she finished, mind racing a mile a minute at the blank look he was giving her. She wanted to see the grinning, teasing Nick Radford that had visited her in her dreams the past year and a half. She wanted that Nick Radford in front of her, cracking jokes or engaging in one of their sentimental chats. She just wanted him to be less serious, about this, at least. Normally she was okay with serious, preferred it even, and they definitely needed to have a talk, but it was late and Cassie was probably looking for them and they still might act like this never happened tomorrow and— \"I'm sorry I said all that shit about you,\" he said, eyes never leaving hers. He looked at her intently. \"You always do things for the greater good and to help others, and I didn't see that and only focused on what I was going through instead of what I was putting you through.\" Her mouth felt incredibly dry. He just—it'd been a literal year since they had argued, and now he apologized? She thought they were so far overdo that it would never happen, and now that it had...she was sad. Apologizing and thinking about the other person was one of the simplest tasks to do, and they had spent an entire year apart because they were both too prideful and hurt to suck it up. \"I'm pushy,\" she got out, feeling heat stirring in her stomach. \"I shouldn't have butted into your business and insisted you break up with Courtney when you weren't, like, cheating or anything. It wasn't my place.\" She knew she had a tendency to like the view from behind the wheel much more than from the backseat, but the matter of the fact is that she understood Nick needed to drive his own life, and she hadn't let him do that. He scoffed lightly, a grin quirking his lips upward. What she recognized as butterflies in her stomach flew up into a frenzy. \"Yeah, well I might as well have been cheating,\" he chuckled, eyes shining in the dull moonlight. Grace felt her face contort. \"What do you mean?\" His small grin disappeared. \"Oh, I thought I could joke around about it now, but…\" She tilted her head a little, thinking. \"Do...do you still…?\" He hesitated before answering, \"I did then. During—Courtney. I think she noticed a few times, actually.\" She faked a smile, an uneasy feeling settling in her gut now that he had answered her question in past tense. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Shouldn't I be relieved it's not still going on? \"That must've been awful for her.\" \"I felt bad for Noah,\" he agreed, nodding. \"Every time he would ask if we had a fun time hanging out, I felt like an imposter or something.\" Then again, shouldn't I have been upset when Noah broke it off? That hardly affected me at all. There was an issue at hand, and it was the elephant on the dock, but she wasn't sure if she should go there or not. He had already moved on, and they seemed to be in a really good place even if it was just for the night. This would jeopardize that, and besides; her feelings would still be there tomorrow. That's what made up her mind for her. That was troubling, and she needed to sleep on this after writing everything down in her journal to process it. Tomorrow she may still feel the same, but her brain would already be working to appropriate it and place things into boxes. Before she could say anything, Nick shuffled his feet and decided, \"We should probably head back inside.\" He ran his fingers through his hair and glanced around the dock. \"I...I'm really glad we talked, Grace.\" He offered her a tiny smile, one of the many she loved. Her stomach felt like it was about to tear open and let a kaleidoscope of butterflies hurriedly fly out. She wanted to express her gratitude, even if the future was unknown, when he spoke again. \"And I'm sorry if...things are bit weird, y'know…\" He wound up mumbling and he approached her, head down, and she honestly had no clue how she was still standing. This boy was way too cute for his own good. \"I…\" Love you. Grace met him halfway and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, sighing when she felt the weight of his hands on her back. \"You have nothing to be sorry for,\" she breathed, tensing slightly when the hair on the back of his neck stood up at her words. It was an odd sensation, to know she had the same effect on him that he had on her, but she drank it in regardless. When they untangled themselves and she felt too light without his weight on her, he took initiative and started to walk back up the dock. She sucked in a breath and and willed her legs to follow him—except she couldn't. This didn't feel like the right end to their conversation, not by a long shot. It had taken them several months to work through their fight and right their wrongs and even look at each other for more than five seconds, and now they were just going to head back inside as if nothing ever happened? I'm sorry, but we've been through way too much for just a hug. She wasn't sure what she was doing, just like most of what happened tonight, but still she called out, \"Nick!\" and waited until he stopped to walk after him. He didn't say anything, only looked at her in anticipation. He expected her to say something. She expected her to say something. What was she going to say? The only sound was that of her feet padding across the dock until she reached him, at which point she parted her lips and waited for anything to leave them. He was waiting too, his brown eyes staring into her own orbs with slight suspense. Her mind was whirring and whirring and wouldn't quit—until it did. And she stopped thinking, and leaned up on her tiptoes, her right hand going to his neck and bringing him down to meet her lips. Nothing. She was apparently going to say nothing. He was kissing her back, that much she knew for certain. She felt a hesitant hand on her hip and tasted his lips moving against hers, but otherwise she had no indication this was actually happening. She'd dreamt about this before, despite all her attempts at pushing it away to the back of her mind. It never worked; it always resurfaced anyway, usually when he smiled at her in a way that made her lightheaded, or when he purposely left cinnamon on her nose while they were cooking. She smiled into the kiss, memories flooding her mind fondly. It was dark enough that when they came up for air, her eyes had to adjust to the face right in front of her. It was a distant thought that if anyone were to look out from the lake house, they'd see them. Only two silhouettes backlit by the bright moonlight, but it would be them, and that's when it hit her: this had changed them. This had changed them completely, and she was okay with that. And she could tell he was too, by the way he grinned and whispered, \"Thank God,\" before diving in for another kiss. This time, both his hands made their way to the small of her back, pulling her flush against him while her arms moved around his neck and her hands knotted behind his head, keeping him close. Their mouths pressed against each other feverishly, not because they were impatient but because they weren't. Four years. Four years and they hadn't done this once. Nick inched closer to Grace, and she moved with him—which was a mistake, because the momentum was too much and in the following seconds she was calling out his name as they both tumbled over the dock's edge and into the lake. He surfaced first and shook his hair out, gasping. Any heat they had created had dissolved the second they hit the water. A few moments later, Grace's head popped up and she breathed heavily, a hand wiping at her face to fix her hair. \"Nick!\" she said again, treading water. \"I just took a shower!\" \"So did I!\" he reminded her, shivering. Then he really looked at her and grinned, heart warming. \"You look adorable right now.\" She flushed, but that was all the acknowledgment he was getting. \"Please help me up,\" she pleaded, swimming right beside the dock's side. He nodded and wrapped an arm around her waist, the other reaching up to hold the dock. \"Grab on,\" he instructed, and she latched onto the dock and began pulling her body up. His hand switched to holding one of her legs as he gave her a boost. If he wasn't worried about going under he'd lift her with both hands. Once she was up, she held a hand out to him and together he was sitting beside her, both of them soaked and teeth chattering. He ran his hands up his arms once, the motion not doing anything to ward off the cold. \"That—was freezing,\" she noted, angling her body towards his. They caught eyes and couldn't help but laugh. \"Certainly a kiss to remember,\" he quipped, face burning from both the chill and the smiling. They didn't know who leaned in first, but Grace's head was against his shoulder and Nick's head was resting on hers. It did nothing to stop their shaking, but they didn't care. They only had a little while longer before it'd be unacceptable to be outside, and they were going to take advantage of their time alone. In the comfortable silence that followed, Grace thought back to the beginning portion of their conversation. She tipped her head back and asked, \"Middleton?\" Nick sighed. \"Yeah. I didn't know, but I figured there was a good chance you'd be attending, so I applied.\" Her heart felt so full, and yet it wanted to shatter at the same time. She lifted her head and twisted her body to face him properly. \"But I'm not going to Middleton,\" she explained sadly, eyes soft and melancholy. \"I know. Overheard Cassie mention it.\" He turned to look at her. \"It'll be fine, you know,\" he said after watching her for a few beats. \"We'll get through this.\" Grace let out a weighty breath and commented, \"College is the least of what we'll have to deal with.\" She hated feeling defeated so soon after such a magnificent high, but here she was. They couldn't deny their step-sibling status, or that she would be packed up and flown out of state in just under a week and a half. She wanted to be optimistic, but she was all realist in the moment. Nick nudged her nose with his, a small smile playing at his lips. \"Grace. We'll be fine. Eighteen months to make up for, right?\" God, her heart ached for those months lost. Grinning warmly, she leaned forward and repeated, \"Eighteen months to make up for,\" in agreement before pressing her lips against his again, the already-familiar touch setting her on edge in the best possible way. His hand came up to trace her jawline, and her foot played with his pant leg as they both came alive. This was the summer she hadn't let herself hope for. This was where she wanted to be today, tomorrow, and three years down the line. She was wet, she was cold, and she didn't know what time it was, but none of that mattered, and she was thankful that didn't matter. All she wanted to focus on was the lips on hers and the blissful moan escaping her as Nick opened his mouth. This was definitely what she wanted, and she was finally getting it. 401 got me thinking of a different fic idea, but this one was prominent and isn't based on another \"make take on [insert whatever],\" and my mind got stuck on it, so here we are. i love this so much, and i hope you do too. also on wattpad and ao3. check out my nace vids on youtube (ironicsopsychotic)!

Nothing from the inside contradicted this. Well, not exactly nothing. The owner contradicted this in spades. For instance, she wasn't struggling financially. From the outside there were problems as well. I'm not the kind of good-looking rugged stranger who lives by his own rules alone and lonely and who needs a good woman to make him complete. I mean I am alone and lonely but the odds of a woman, any woman, wanting to make me feel complete seem like long odds. The kind of odds that I'm not willing to bet on. But if I were willing to go all-in on a bet I'd surely lose it would be for the owner of this bed'n'breakfast. A woman only ever known to me as Cassie. I walked in and asked if a room, any room, was available. \"Dave! I've been expecting you! Please come in and have some chamomile lavender tea before I show you to your room.\" How did she know— \"Your name is on the tag on your lapel.\" She said with a twinkle that I would grow to know and love over the next hour. My name tag. I was driving home from a convention a few towns over and decided to stop in this town for the night. I was still wearing my jacket with my name tag. Embarrassed I pulled off the tag and muttered something about sleepless nights and lives wished forgotten... \"Nonsense, if we all wore name tags imagine all the social awkwardness we could avoid. Now sit,\" twinkle \"while I get that tea.\" It was then that I noticed she was wearing a name tag with Cassie on it. The only place to sit was at an antique table with a backgammon board recessed into it. The dice cups were made of old leather well-oiled and the pieces of bakelite. This was an expensive set that would easily fetch thousands at auction. \"Beautiful, no?\" And yes she was beautiful. The light from the kitchen shined behind her making her glow in that unearthly way only angels know how to do while holding a silver tray with two tea cups and various cookies that suggested a comforting bosom that would keep a man warm and safe at night, and smiling a smile that would melt that man's heart regardless of how many times it had been trampled on by cold heartless vixens whose only goal in life was to trample the heart of that man. \"I was talking about the backgammon board.\" Twinkle, a laugh, and a casual hair toss. Once again, my eyes down, muttered something about how not since the dawn of man … \"Come,\" that twinkle \"let's play a game! It's so rare to find someone these days who knows how to play backgammon!\" \"But how did you know—\" The laughter, the twinkle. \"You do know how right? So let's get to it!\" I do know and we did. We rolled to see who would go first and she ended up with a 6-5 and ran her back checker to the safety of her mid-point. \"Ah, the 'lovers-leap' roll. How do you think it got that name?\" She was staring deeply in my eyes. So deeply that I had no way to answer even if I had known the answer. \"I'm sure it was something romantic yet tragical. Anyway, it's your turn.\" I rolled a 3-2. I played the reverse-split putting checkers on my 22 and 10 points. The best move was a normal split but my brain skipped a beat for some reason and I misplayed. Of course she rolled double-5s making her ace and trey points while putting both of my checkers on the bar. I don't remember what I rolled next but I know it wasn't enough to get my checkers back in the game. Everything else after this was a blur. She kept moving her pieces around the board laughing, twinkling, chatting with the ease of a butterfly landing on a sunflower, and filling in her home board. Meanwhile my checkers continued to dance on the bar and each time I rolled I knew what the outcome was going to be so I stopped even looking and instead stared at her as she expertly closed out her board just as my heart was being forever sealed into her twinkling blue eyes. Even at the end when all her checkers were on her ace point all I could roll was double-1s. She ended it all with a 6-6 and squealed with delight while clapping her hands. \"A backgammon! That never happens in real life!\" In real life I never meet a woman like this. \"I love you Cassie! I love you more than I even knew was possible! I love you like a lone and thirsty dandelion loves the first drop of a Spring rain. I love you like the English language loves the pen of Shakespeare. I love you like the human ear loves the Chaconne in d minor. I … I … I—\" \"I know.\" She smiled but did not twinkle. Her head tilted to the side and she looked upon me kindly, a kindliness that shattered my heart into a million tiny pieces of glass that pierced every inch of my soul. And then she touched my shoulder. \"Now get in your car and drive back home to your wife and remember how you used to feel the same way about her and let that memory guide you on your journey together.\" Driving back home I couldn't stop thinking about the game and what Cassie had said to me. How did she know I was married? How did she know that our marriage was in trouble? Did she know about the fight we had before I left for the convention? That there were accusations of infidelity? Questions about paternity? Did she know that that I had bashed my wife's skull in with a stone chess board and left her there dead while I went to the convention? Did she know that my only journey with my wife would be now as I drive my car off this cliff to the ground 1,000 feet below?

Right now it is just a one-shot but I have a few more ideas if anyone is interested in a short multi-chapter fic. So, review and let me know what you think. Disclaimer: I don't own the Burlesque movie or its characters. \"What about this one?\" Ali said holding up another outfit. Clothes were thrown all around the room by Ali trying to fond an outfit. \"They all look amazing. It doesn't matter what you are wearing she will love you anyways, I know it.\" \"Jack, you are no help! I can't just wear anything. I really want her to like me.\" Ali said exasperated. \"And she will. Trust me. Now put on your favourite outfit and we'll go.\" Jack said. He walked over and kissed her temple. 15 Minutes later they were in Ali's car (since Jack still had his motorcycle) and on their way to a small bistro in the heart of L.A. Looking out the window, Ali reminisced about how her life has become what it has. Just a few weeks ago, she was helping Tess save the club and her life has only gotten better since. After the big performance, Ali and Jack made up and have been madly in love ever since. And today they were on their way to lunch with Jack's mother. They pulled up outside the restaurant. Jack got out of the car and went around and opened Ali's door. \"Listen, just be yourself and she will love you!\" \"I just don't want to mess this up.\" \"And you won't. I love you.\" They shared a kiss and walked inside. Jack spotted her immediately, and they walked over to her. \"Jack!\" she exclaimed. She ran the rest of the way to them and hugged Jack. She hadn't seen him in years and was beyond excited. When he told her that he wanted to introduce her new girl she was beyond excited. The way he talked about Ali, she knew that this was the girl for him. When she had met Natalie, she was not a fan. But, she put a smile in her face and was supportive of Jack. \"And you must be Ali,\" said shaking Ali's hand. They all sat down and a waiter was soon over to get their drink orders. \"So Ali, Jack told me that you are the star of the club.\" \"Oh hardly.\" \"Come on Ali, Tess built the show around you when she heard you sing. I still remember that day. Everyone was absolutely speechless afterwards.\" \"Wow, I would love to hear you sing sometime Ali.\" They all made small talk throughout the meal and found themselves continuing to talk after too. Ali felt completely comfortable around Jack's mom and they got along great. When Jack looked at his watch he realized it was getting late and they both had to get to the club soon or Tess wouldn't be happy. \"Mom I'm sorry to say this but me and Ali have to get going, we have to be at the club soon.\" \"Oh Jack don't worry about it, I'm just going to go sight seeing for a bit, and maybe I'll pop into the club later.\" \"That would be wonderful if you did, we are doing one of my favourite sets tonight.\" Ali said. \"If you do, stop by the bar and say hi to me, that is if you can peel your eyes off of Ali for long enough.\" \"Oh Jack,\" Ali said, a slight blush creeping up her neck. \"Well, it was nice meeting you Ali, I would love to get together again while I'm here if you guys aren't too busy.\" \"Not at all, and it was nice meeting you too.\" With that they said their goodbyes and went their separate ways, Ali and Jack to the club, and Mrs. Miller to Sunset Boulevard for sightseeing. When they arrived at the club, Ali went straight to the back to get changed and do her hair, and Jack went to the bar to start setting up. Ali was just finishing up her makeup when Jack came up behind her and kissed her cheek. \"I told you she'd love you, I don't know what you were so worried about.\" \"Shut up,\" Ali said turning around in her seat and kissing Jack. After a not so innocent kiss, Sean walked in and started whistling. They separated laughing, knowing just who would do that. \"I'll come see you later,\" Ali whispered and turned back around to finish her make up. A/N: So what did you think? Review and let me know. Once again, if I get some interest in this story I can continue it.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Jack's POV The club is packed tonight. It has been ever since Ali started singing. Everyone comes to hear her. They changed the show so it's a different set every night of the week and it gets slightly altered every other week so that people can continue to come back and not see the same show. Tonight features some of Ali's favorites. Mostly it has songs that I wrote. Tess worked out a deal that for every song that I write that works she gives me a bonus. With the club doing as well as it is, Ali and I are doing pretty well for ourselves, and growing up where we did we both don't take it for granted. Ali just finished Big Spender, a burlesque classic and I couldn't keep my eyes off of her. I haven't been much help at the bar lately. I never can keep my eyes off her. Coco and Georgia take the stage to give Ali a chance to rest her voice and get changed. I turned back around to make some drinks when I heard a familiar voice. \"You weren't kidding when you said she was amazing.\" \"Everyone comes just to see her...What can I get for you mom, it's on me.\" \"Just a glass of chardonnay will be fine.\" \"Did you see all the sights you wanted to?\" I ask while pouring her wine. \"I saw most of them.\" \"Ali and I can take you on a tour sometime if you like.\" \"Sure, that would be great.' We continued talking while I made drinks for the waitresses to deliver. It was almost intermission and I was hoping Ali would join me down at the bar. Ali's POV I just finished Big Spender, one of my favorites, and went back to my station to change. Coco, Georgia and some of the other girls went on for Dr. Longjohn which gave me time to change. After their number it will be intermission which is about 10-15 minutes long. Sometimes I go down to the bar and others I stay back here and relax. I just finished changing into my next outfit for the number after intermission. I put my hair up into my wig and decided I would go spend my break with Jack. By this time intermission had started and there were usually a lot of people walking around. To avoid everyone I decided to go the long way to get to the bar. I had to go down a bunch of hallways instead of walking through the club but atleast it was quiet. Well until I saw him. Marcus. I hadn't seen him since I was at his house when he picked me up from Sean's. The day Natalie had shown up. He looked angry. \"Ali! Just who I was looking for.\" \"Marcus,\" I said. \"How have you been? \"I'm alright, you?\" I said trying to be civil. In all reality Marcus is the last person I want to be seeing right now. \"I've been better. You know, I was not impressed when I heard Tess got money to pay the banks and is keeping the club. I had a lot of plans for this club and they were all dumped down the drain.\" \"Well, I'm sorry you didn't get your dream building but this club is her baby, I think you can understand why she didn't give it up.\" \"No, I really can't.\" \"Well thats too bad, but everyone who works here is like my family so I'm sorry that I don't have much sympathy for you.\" That didn't make him happy. I saw Marcus get even more angry. He slowly got closer to me and I instinctively backed up. He kept getting closer until I was pressed up against a wall and he was about 2 inches away from my face. It was then that I could smell the alcohol coming off his breath. He was clearly drunk. Jack's POV I guess Ali decided to stay in the back during intermission today. I don't blame her the club is packed tonight and she probably needed some peace and quiet. I check my watch and it's been about 25 minutes. The second half of the show should have started already. The bar has been so busy that I didn't even realize. \"Jack, have you seen Ali?\" Sean asks. He must be looking for her. \"No, I thought she stayed in the back. Where could she be? Aiden cover the bar!\" I yelled I walked out from behind the bar. \"Wow Jack, relax, she's probably in the bathroom. I just thought I would check here first incase you two lost track of time in each other's mouths.\" \"Come on Sean, you and I both know Ali isn't late for her numbers. I'm helping you find her.\" Ali's POV \"Marcus, please let go of me.\" I was scared. Marcus now had me pinned against the wall. He had my arms in a vice grip and I couldn't get out. I was at a loss for what to do. \"Why? So you can run to that bartender who wears more eyeliner than Nikki? What is he going to do?\" \"Marcus please, I'm going to be late for my number.\" I didn't want to delay the show. Tess would be pissed at me. \"No, after everything I did for you. I had producers come meet you just so I could get a chance to get you in bed. And this is how you repay me, telling Tess my plan. I could have made millions, and instead I got distracted by you. Ya know you aren't even that good I just expected you to be easy like the rest of the girls here. But, you are far worse than everyone else. You're a slut, jumping from that loser guy to me and right into someone else's bed.\" By this point I gave up, everything he said I had been fearing for awhile now. I had tears streaming down my face. I was barely holding it together. \"See, you have nothing to say for yourself. I must be spot on, just a nobody from nowhere.\" \"Marcus, please, you're hurting me, please, stop\" I managed to whisper. \"NO, YOU BITCH!\" He yelled before slamming me back into the wall. I heard a crack and fell to the ground from the impact. All I felt was pain in my head. A constant throb that overpowered my hearing. Jack's POV Me and Sean had covered most of the club with no luck. Tess had eventually gone on to keep the show going. We were heading back to the bar with the last strand of my hope barely holding on. That's when I heard it. The sound of someone yelling and a girl crying and whimpering. But not just any girl. Ali. I ran to where the noise was coming from. By the time we got there, I saw Ali on the ground holding her head and Marcus standing over yelling at her. I walked straight to him and punched him. I didn't stop until Sean put his hand on my shoulder. It was like I was snapped out of a daze. I looked down and saw a bloody Marcus, struggling for consciousness. I immediately walked over to Ali. She was still in the same position as when we first got there. Sitting against the wall, her knees up to her chest and she was holding her head. \"Ali,\" I said quietly trying to get her attention. She didn't look up so I tried again. \"Ali,\" I said a little louder. She looked up with fear in her eyes. Her hands never leaving her ears. It took her a second and then she realized it was me. \"Jack,\" she croaked out. I bent down and picked her up. She put her head against my chest and started sobbing. I carried her straight out into the parking lot and to our car. I forgot Sean was there until he opened the car door for me so I could place her in the seat. I sat her down and she grabbed my hand, terrified that I would let her go. \"Ali, I'm not going anywhere.\" I turned around to see Sean still standing there. \"What can I do?\" He asked me. \"First, call the damn cops and have that asshole arrested.\" \"Ok, can I get anything for her?\" \"Yea, yea, get her stuff from her station, tell Tess, and maybe grab a bottle of water.\" \"Ok, be back in 10 tops.\" With that he ran back for the club. I turned my attention back to Ali. While I was talking to Sean she had gone back to holding her head. \"Ali, can you tell me what's wrong, did he hurt you?\" She only nods. \"Okay, what hurts?\" She looks at me and for the first time I notice that she never stopped crying. \"My head,\" she whispers. \"Ok, where?\" \"Everywhere, and I have a massive headache.\" \"Ok, anything else?\" She shakes her head slightly. \"Alright.\" Sean comes running out at that moment with Ali's bag and Tess in tow. \"Is she alright?\" Tess asks. \"I'm not sure right now.\" \"Take care of her, I'll come check on her later.\" \"Ok,\" Sean hands me her things and Tess runs back for the club, she still has a show to finish. \"Listen Jack, when I went back in, I went to see if Marcus was still there and that's when I realized some glass was cracked and had blood on it.\" I could feel the blood drain from my face. I turned back to Ali. \"Ali, sweetie, I need to look at your head for a second.\" And sure enough, after some careful maneuvering Ali had a cut on the back of her head that looked pretty bad. \"Sean, I'm going to take her to the hospital, tell Tess i'll keep her updated. You two will be the first to know.\" \"Alright.\" I got Ali into a somewhat comfortable position and drove her to the hospital as fast as I could. When we got there I carried her inside and someone immediately got her a gurney. We were brought to a room and I told them everything I knew that happened. Through everything I felt terrible for Ali. Every doctor and Nurse that came in and tried to touch her she jumped and freaked out. The doctor said she was just in shock but that didn't make it any better. But soon enough, we were being discharged and on our way home. Ali had to get a couple stitches but other than some shock and bruising on her arms she'll be alright. At Least that's what the doctor said. We were soon home. I helped her change into some pajamas and get into bed. I told her i would be right back before making my way to the kitchen. I got out two glasses and filled them with water. I looked down and drank some. This was the first time I stopped to think about everything that has happened. I gave myself a whole 20 seconds before picking up the phone and calling Sean and Tess. They both were so worried about her. They promised they would stop by tomorrow. I picked up the glasses and made my way back to the bedroom. I put on some sweatpants, pulled off my shirt and climbed into bed. \"Ali,\" I whispered. She rolled over and looked at me with her big, sad eyes. \"I was so scared, I didn't know what to do.\" She whispered with more tears streaming down her face. \"Oh, Ali, its alright. It's over now and I won't let him hurt you again.\" I said while pulling her into my chest. And that is how we fell asleep. Me holding her, while she cried her self to sleep, and I followed shortly after, both of us exhausted from today's events. A/N: So I couldn't get this idea out of my head and had to write about it. I plan to have another chapter or two after this one. I know Burlesque is kind of old at this point and nobody really reads these fanfics but I'm still going to write this for those of there out there who love it just as much as I do. Review and let me know what you think![Chapter 3] Author's Note: This is a bit of a shorter chapter but I was struggling a bit with it and just had to write it. Anyways, let me know what you think of it. And I plan to have about 3-5 more chapters in this story depending on the length of them. Chapter 3 Jack's POV I woke up and Ali was still asleep. It was early and after everything that happened last night, she needs her sleep. I got up and turned on the coffee machine, using some of the instant coffee instead of grinding fresh beans. I want to let Ali sleep for as long as possible. After coffee, I hop in the shower, while scrubbing my body I think about what happened last night. I don't know why Marcus was so mad at Ali, and what he said to her. I don't know if I ever will know because I don't want to make Ali relive it if she doesn't have to. I get out of the shower, dry off and wrap the towel around my waist. I walk into our bedroom to get dressed and notice Ali not in bed anymore. I look in the living room and see that she is sitting on the couch. I get dressed and walk out to see her. \"Hey,\" I say. \"Hey,\" she says back while putting a magazine down. \"What would you like for breakfast, I can cook something or we can go out if you are feeling up to it.\" \"No, I still need to shower and change and I'd rather just stay in.\" \"Alright no problem, let me see what we have,\" I said walking over to the fridge,\"Well I can make eggs or we have the ingredients for pancakes...what do you feel like.\" \"Well I'm not very hungry, but maybe some strawberry pancakes if we have strawberries.\" \"Yep, I'll start it now.\" \"Ok, I'm going to go in the shower then.\" \"Ok.\" Ali's POV I grab a towel from the closet and walk into the bathroom. I look in the mirror and I look like a mess. I have makeup smeared down my face from crying and sleeping with it on. My hair is a giant mess. And to top it all off I have bruises all over my arms. I feel gross. The way Marcus grabbed me yesterday and everything that happened comes flooding back. Everything that he called me: slut, whore, ugly, untalented. They all circle in my head. A few new ones are added to the list when I look in the mirror. Fat, worthless, easy. I look away and go in the shower. That's when I let myself full on cry. The sound of the water masking my sobs. I sit on the floor of the bathtub and sob. The worst part is that everything Marcus said, is something I feared at one time or another. I remember when Tess said that she thought I was spreading myself a little thin. Her exact words were \"Don't you think you're spreading yourself a little thin….Jack, Marcus, whoever?\" On top of that, wearing skimpy outfits on a stage with bright lights and hundreds of people seeing you on any given week, you have to feel confident in your body. I was always quite confident in my body until Marcus said that to me. Seeing myself in the mirror with the ugly bruises, I can easily how he and others see that I am ugly, under all my makeup and fake lashes, it's me. Plain, boring Ali from Iowa. And there really isn't anything special about me. Jack's POV I finish making the pancakes and Ali still isn't out of the shower. I decide to go check on her. I go up to the bathroom door and am about to knock when I hear quiet sobs coming from inside. I walk inside to see Ali sitting on the floor of the bathroom sobbing. \"Ali, are you alright?\" It's like she is snapped out of a daze. She looks over at me with obvious tears streaming down her face, despite the water from the shower. She looked at me and simply shook her head. I reached over and turned off the shower. I grabbed a towel, wrapped her up and picked her up. Sitting on the floor, I help Ali while she cried. When her sobs subsided, I asked, \" Do you want to talk about it?\" \"Not Really,\" she said quietly, \" But you deserve to know.\" \"No, if you aren't ready i-\" I'm cut off by her. \"I need to, or I'm not sure if I ever will be ready.\" \"Okay, if you need to stop though, know that you can.\" \"Ok, I just finished my number and got changed and by that time it was intermission. I wanted to come see you but I knew the club was packed so I took the back hallways around to the bar. Well, on my way, I ran into Marcus and he started asking me questions. When I told him I had to leave he wasn't happy and started backing me into a wall. He grabbed my wrists and wouldn't let me go. He started yelling at me and I realized he was drunk. I could smell it on his breath. Eventually he got so angry with me that he bashed my head against the wall and I think that's when you showed up. But the worst part was when he was yelling at me. He called me things and names and-\" I heard her choke down her sob. I held her tighter against me waiting to see if she would continue. \"And I believe him,\" it came out quietly but I still heard it. She broke down again and was sobbing into my chest. I whispered soothing words into her ear until she calmed down. \"Ali, what did he call you?\" \"Ugly, untalented, slut, you name it he called me it. And why doubt it, I'm everything he called me.\" \"You may be stubborn but you are beautiful, amazingly talented and nowhere near a slut.\" \"Tess and Sean and practically everyone at the club think I'm a slut, and I'm starting to think I am too.\" \"Ali, don't fall down that hole, once you do, it will be so hard for you to get back out. Everyone at the club was simply worried about you, nothing more. Now, my beautiful girlfriend, lets have some breakfast.\" And with that we got up, Ali got dressed and after heating up the pancakes, we ate breakfast. And all I could think of was how much I'm going to have to keep reminding Ali of how perfect she really is.

He felt it like a punch in the gut. Cassandra Nightingale was like a storm – she had battered against his defenses relentlessly (even when he was cruel she was kind), not letting him get to her. Stephanie said something, but he couldn't quite make it out – he was looking at Cassie and was furious . She'd been the one to reach out and now that he was reaching back, she was dancing with Ryan. Ryan, who anyone could see is half in love with her. He dragged his eyes away from the couple (he didn't like it, at all) and tuned back in to Stephanie just as the blonde turned to look at him. He made his excuses, escaping from the house and making it back to his own in record time. Nick was nowhere to be seen (and for the first time since moving here, he didn't feel inclined to chase his son down). He tugged at his tie, loosening the constricting knot and stared out the window, watching as first Stephanie, and then Ryan left. He scowled – the younger man turned to look back at Cassie and waved before driving away – Cassie was still standing in the doorway, still in that stunning dress, with an odd smile on her face and her hair mussed (like Ryan has been running his hand through it). Sam crossed their gardens and was at her doorway before he realized it, his suit disheveled and his tie a far cry from the perfect knot it had been earlier in the day. \"Sam!\" Cassie looked at him with wide eyes, and he thought he might have surprised her for once. Good. His scowl deepened as he returned her gaze and stepped closer to her – she'd kicked off her shoes and he noticed how small she was, compared to his own height. He was crowding her, he knew, but couldn't bring himself to care. She shifted backwards, leaving him room to enter the house. \"Is everything okay?\" Her voice was husky and soft as she reached out to place a hand on his arm. \"Sam?\" He cleared his throat but didn't speak, instead looking around. The house seemed empty, the caterers having left with Stephanie. His eyes tracked through the room before falling back onto Cassie, who had since closed the door and walked further into the room. \"Did he kiss you?\" He demanded suddenly, stepping closer (overstepping boundaries he shouldn't be crossing but he couldn't bring himself to care) so that he could study her face. \" Excuse me?\" Cassie sounded incredulous, and he couldn't blame her. This was none of his business, except that it was . \"Did he kiss you?\" He repeated the question, but his voice was raspier than normal, and his hand was itching to cup the curve of her cheek, to feel the softness of her skin, to delve into the inky cloud that was her hair. \"Sam, what's going on?\" He could see her take a breath to steady herself, to rebuild that cool veneer of calm she normally carried and he couldn't, wouldn't , let it happen. \"Answer the question, Cassandra , did Ryan kiss you?\" He let her name roll of his tongue, relishing the way her eyes darkened the slightest bit, before taking her hand in his and pulling her closer. \"I never did get that dance you promised, Cassie.\" She looked at him, as if searching for something, before she relaxed in his arms, letting her own arms link loosely behind his neck as he dropped his to her waist. The music was soft and they swayed to the gentle strains in a comfortable silence. \"He didn't kiss me, Sam.\" Her voice was soft, as if she was hesitant to talk loudly and break the spell that had fallen over them. \"I kissed -\" \"No, I understand why you did that,\" he broke in, didn't add that he hated it all the same – \"I want to know if he kissed you, afterwards.\" He rubbed soft circles into her waist with his thumbs and he liked the way her breath hitched as she shook her head. \"Good.\" He couldn't keep the satisfaction out of his voice, but he was content to leave it there for now. Cassie looked almost amused, and her dark eyes seemed to glow as she looked up at him. \"Were you jealous , Sam?\" She didn't give him time to respond before she continued, her voice firm. \"Ryan and I are just friends, Sam, but that's all the two of us are, as well. Friends - there's no reason for you to care if Ryan kissed me, and the caveman role does not suit you, at all.\" He saw her point, he really did – but he couldn't help the way he felt. \"What if I want more? What if I want more than friendship from you, Cassandra Nightingale?\" The music was still playing but he drew them to a stop, his hands still anchored around her waist. \"What if I want to be the one who you kiss, the one who gets to hold you like this?\" Sam loosened his hold on her, giving her time to think. He wanted her, wanted the chance to know her, to learn what made her tick but he wouldn't push. He'd put himself out there; let her know where he stood. It was up to her now. ::: Cassie's heartbeat was threatening to deafen her. She stared at Sam Radford, who stood there calmly, as if he hadn't just turned her world upside down. She wasn't ready, despite what she'd told Grace earlier in the night – had her daughter seen this, when she'd told Cassie it was time? Sam's hands were warm on her waist, but he was only resting them there, his hold on her almost non-existent. Cassie couldn't think – Sam had laid a bombshell on her and she hadn't seen it coming at all. At least she'd had some warning of Ryan's feelings (Stephanie had certainly been vocal enough), but this – this had come out of nowhere. Except – you've been flirting with him since he moved in , her traitorous mind whispered, you've both been flirting with each other . \"Sam, I - \" she looked at him, her mind racing. How did she feel about her neighbor? She hadn't let herself think about it, not consciously. He was certainly handsome enough, and there was attraction there, a lot of it, if she was honest. Was she willing to risk it, though? Yes. Keeping her eyes on his, she shifted forward slightly, before using her hands to guide his head closer. \"Sam,\" she started again, trying to put her feelings into words. \"Just give me a chance, Cassie,\" Sam murmured, before dipping his head and brushing his lips against hers lightly. \"Give us a chance.\" She inhaled sharply, looking into his clear eyes. He was so different from Jake, but didn't she owe it to him, owe it to herself , to see if there was something there? She relaxed into his embrace, letting herself settle against his torso. \"Yes,\" she said quietly, feeling a thrill shoot up her spine as his hands settled more firmly on her waist. His smile was breathtaking and she felt a tug in her stomach as her lips curled in response. Cassie tilted her head, initiating another kiss, feeling his lips part under hers as he responded, before pulling away. \"Yes,\" she repeated, more for her own sake than his. It was time.

This is my very first fanfic published here. Since the TV series seems to make them as future stepped siblings and no one really writes about them. I decided to satisfy myself... Well English is not my first language and I'm really terrible at grammars, so please forgive any sentences doesn't make sense. I'm open to all reminders and corrections. Disclaimer: I Do NOT own anything. All rights reserved to TV series GOOD WITCH. 25-year-old Nick Radford couldn't recall what he was like when he was 15 years old. The memory became blurred and indistinctive after entire ten years. Sometimes he wondered how he and his father moved to Middleton exactly. But he just couldn't remember it clearly, including his resistance of the small town at the beginning, his fight with his father that lasted for years, and his waspish temper towards anyone trying to be close to him. It's seemed to people who were around this young man now, who has no idea about his past, that he was naturally born this way: Gentle, patient, courteous and loving. But he was not. Someone has taken years to walk to him, to be close to him, to care him with a full heart, and to push him until he admitted that he wanted to be a better person for her. Grace Russell. His BEST friend. Nick loved his family, both his parents, Cassie and all the Russell family members along with her came into his life; he loved his friends, John, Michael, Dan, and Noah, the coolest and nicest boys he met. He loved his teachers in Middleton High and all those great people in Middleton. But Nick knew there'a difference, a huge difference between the people he loved and Grace. They were part of his life, his grateful life(which he appreciated a lot). But Grace, she's something else. She's the one who he shared life with. When this thought came into his mind, Nick, sitting on a single couch beside the window, could not stop himself from smiling. They had gone through years of awkwardness before they eventually admitted how they felt about each other and their \"friendship\". It's really not easy, speaking in every aspect. They were both too young when they first met and it's hard to judge whether it was a good thing or a bad thing. Grace and he had become very dependent on each other ever since they got close. Almost everyone in the Middleton who know them knew that they were best friends hung out together all the time. So they had learned everything about each other, likes, dislikes, fears, things another was good at, etc. But it was also the problem that they had been together for too long: They had lost the ability to feel excited or allured by one another. (So it's not a lie that Grace and Nick thought they could be and would be stepped-siblings when they heard their parents were dating.) \"We could be siblings by some chances.\"Nick murmured, though deep down inside his heart he knew he did purposely to miss them and would do the same decision a thousand times over if he'd be given a second chance. Courtney, technically his first \"girlfriend\" after he moving into Middleton has crossed his mind. He could barely remember her face by now, but this girl was so impressive, enough to let him recall the name at any time. Honestly, Nick thought (and still insisted) he had a crush on her back in tenth grade. Courtney was pretty, and she had a kind of feminine tenderness in her eyes which was very attractive. Nick was joyful while dating her, from every perspective he had to say Courtney was an amazing girl and a brilliant girlfriend any boys would want. Except him . Because the person who made them encountered and set them up were becoming a problem that dividing them apart. Nick was used to be with Grace, wherever in school, in Bistro, in the library, or at either one of their houses. They were used to meet after dinner in front of the basketball hoop at his yard, chatting about the day at school such as who did they see, what rumor was going around school, or what tests they had or would have in next couple of days. In both Grace and Nick's eyes, this was just the daily routine they had. But when Courtney came into the picture and became Nick's girlfriend, every sharing chat they had seemed unforgivable for being too chummy (Rather guilty, in Grace's word). Nick and Courtney dated for two months, half of the time they were arguing about if Nick should be so close even intimate to another girl rather than his own girlfriend. Eventually, Nick got tired of all the arguments, also couldn't, well, never thought of giving up his connection with Grace. Then the only way left for him was breaking up. Also because of that, he couldn't tell Grace why on earth he decided to break up with Courtney when they were looked like a sweet couple very much in love. And then things turned to a more horrible way than any one of two of them could imagine. Grace got so frustrated her friend would get more hurt with time passing by while Nick was halting, and she kept pushing him to talk to Courtney. In the end, Grace leaked out the message to Courtney when she had no idea she was just right behind her (25-year-old Nick could literally laugh out loud, this was so classic Grace). Nick was so pissed off at that moment for sure, because his best friend, the girl he's defending for all the time just made thing more complicated that made his brain went blank for a few seconds. He went after Courtney quickly and caught her after few minutes. The girl's face was reddened, full of wrath instead of mirthlessness. \"Hey, Courtney, please! I'm so sorry! Grace didn't mean to.\" \"Ha! now you're telling? What am I? Which girl on earth needs to be informed of breaking up from her boyfriend's BEST friend instead of himself!\" Courtney shouted acidulously. Nick still could remember how horrid it was even ten years had passed by. He's popular and he knew it since very early age. He had dated many girls even before he came to Middleton. But he's never good at facing girl's anger. Every time he irritated a girl, his only solution was running to the next girl and started new dates, and never looked back. They allowed him. Because it's New York. In New York, even kids were much more mature than those in other places. Everyone knew they were too young to be serious about anything. These \"dates\" were more like a game they play around. But this one was different, he couldn't run away. \"Look, I'm so sorry! I'm really sorry that I, I didn't tell you earlier. I didn't want to hurt your feelings.\" He looked at her genuinely, \"And Grace didn't mean to hurt you either, she just so worried about you because I hesitated for so long. Please, don't mad at her, she meant well.\" Once he finished the sentences, he realized he's doomed. REALLY doomed. The softness showed in Courtney's eyes after he apologized vanished so quickly as he mentioned the name that making Nick confused if he imagined it. \"Nick Radford! What's wrong with you?! I AM your girlfriend!\" She couldn't stop her anger coming out from her,\"I didn't come to you! It was you. You were the one asking me out in the first place!\" She's looked so exhausted after shrieking. With gasping, she moved her sight from him, looking at street hollowly, muttered, \"I knew it. I knew it!\" \"I'm sorry.\" That's the only phrase he could come out. \"You should be! You lied to me. Both of you. I didn't expect to date you at the beginning, I didn't.\" Courtney buried her face in her hands so that he wouldn't see her tears coming down from her eyes. \"It was you. You gave me the hope I may be special to you. Why did you play me?\" The guilty feeling was overwhelming Nick, made him shivering like he almost couldn't stand by himself. \"I didn't play you. Courtney, please, I didn't play you. Grace and I are just friends!\" He tried so hard to make his voice sounded confident and convincing enough. Courtney sneered. \"I only wonder how your parents could be so blind, believing you two are just friends.\" \"Courtney...\" \"Shut up! You know well you two care each other in the way far beyond the line of simply being friends! Stop saying that rubbish to me!\" She wiped away the tear marks on her face, took a look at his trembling tight fist, and snorted, \"That's it. I'm breaking up with you.\" She walked away without looking back. Nick stood there, feeling dazed as someone hit his head vehemently with a huge hammer. It was a long time ago, Nick sometimes still felt guilty, not only because he had once broken a girl's heart, but also because he remembered her for the way she triggered the biggest and longest cold fight he ever had with Grace. They hadn't spoken to each other for the whole semester. Nick absolutely knew the reason. Grace was too stubborn to apologize for things she thought herself did right. And him, he was in a befuddled state, confounded by Courtney's words about him and Grace. That's the first time he started considering what Grace Russell really means to him. \"Nick!\" A hand patted on his shoulder, Nick turned his head fiercely looking back, he almost a slight sound of broken at his neck. \"God. Are you trying to let me break my own neck?\" He grunted. The girl with honey brown hair, Grace Russell, smirked mischievously, \"Be fair Nick! I called you thousands of times but you didn't hear me.\" She paused for a moment, examining him, \"What did you think about?\" \"You.\" He grinned, not totally lying. \"How's your work today?\" She rolled her eye with his answer, sitting down beside him, playing his fingers while replied to him, \"Nothing special. That means Mr. Lingston is still mean as usual.\" She sighed heavily, \"I really don't know what I was thinking when I took the job.\" \"Money, I guess,\" Nick gloated, then pulled her into his arm letting her sat on his lap. Hugging the girl rested on his chest, he ran his free fingers through her smooth, long hair. \"Well, you said you will stay till Friday. Today is Wednesday, and you are almost there. This weekend we could go back to Middleton and meet with Cassie and my dad.\" \"Yeah, remind me that tomorrow morning again, wouldn't you? I need some hope to strength me going to work.\" Nick laughed, kissing her lips gently. And then Grace wrapped her arms around his neck pulling him closer and closer. That was a long, soft kiss, Grace felt she's melting in his arms. There was something, something warm inside her heart taking over her everytime they kissed. It's like she would never be lost her way home as long as he's there. It reminded something to her. They parted with uneven gasping, Nick moved his lips to her ear, leaving small kisses. He muttered in a low voice: \"You know I was thinking of a secret I never told you before.\" \"Huh?\" She watched him in questioning. \"You remember Courtney?\" There was a moment Grace's face turned dark and ready shot daggers from her eyes any moment as he spoke a single word blaming her. \"Grace!\" Nick found it's kind of funny how defensive she looked like, but he kept going on,\"You remember how we broke up? I never told you what happened after I ran out Bistro after her that night. I caught her, and...\" Nick muttered at her ear, telling her that she's always the priority even when he broke up with another girl. \"She got so mad. I felt sorry, sincerely. But that was really a blurt out without a second thought.\" Grace listened quietly. It came again, that warm feeling overwhelming her. She felt she lost the strength to manipulate her body, all she could do was wrapping his waist tightly like he's the only thing she had in the world. \"I have a secret too,\" Grace said nearly in a childish tone. \"If you remember Noah.\" Nick looked at her in surprise, \"Of course I do.\" \"We broke after my seventeenth birthday, because of you and your present for me.\" She had lost in the memory for few seconds. with a little bit nostalgic expression on her face. \"He suggested it first. I was so shocked at the time 'cause I didn't think we have any problem. Though it turned out we did. He said he couldn't be together with me anymore, he can't watch his girlfriend giving all her attention to another guy, especially that guy is one of his good friends.\" She smiled lightly at Nick who stayed silent. \"Noah said I was happy with him, but in a simple friend way. Every time I was in trouble, your name come out from my mouth first. He guesses that I just like hanging out with him like the way I would do with any friends of mine. But I only feel secure when I'm with you.\" Nick couldn't find any words to speak but only buried his face in her heir inhaling her scent. The sparkling light in her eyes was so bright that he suddenly afraid of them could burn out his heart. \"Another reason I can't regret the contract.\" He murmured. \"That's a lifelong deal I'm afraid.\" Grace was raising her brow, grinning. Grace Russell's seventeenth birthday present also apology gift from Nick Radford, was a contract. \"Mr. Nick Radford, by all means, grants Miss Grace Russell the right to be mad at him. This means no matter under what kind of circumstances Nick Radford will never be allowed to turn his back to Grace Russell or start a cold fight, or pretend to be strangers avoiding necessary responsibility. Nick Radford will always explain any misunderstandings may be occurred between him and Grace Russell, always work his best to gain support from Grace Russell on every incident they faced together and major matters in his life. Under every condition, Nick Radford could not give up on protecting his connection with Grace Russell. This contract will take effect as long as Miss. Grace Russell wants. Nick Radford agrees to abandon his right of withdrawal in all circumstances.\" ","Summary":" Hello everyone! This is my very first fanfic published here.

I deal with enough crazy drama every day, so I write fluff. I obviously don't own Good Witch. The knock at the door came so softly that Cassie wondered if she had imagined it, that is, until the door cracked open. She could see the silhouette of her nearly 18 year old daughter standing in the doorway. \"Mom,\" Grace whispered, \"Are you awake?\" Cassie glanced next to her to see Sam sleeping soundly. \"Grace? What's wrong? Hold on a second,\" Cassie whispered back, carefully untangling herself from her husband's limbs, as to not wake him. Grace closed the door softly as Cassie managed to extricate herself from the bed, grab her robe, and slip her slippers on her feet. Softly padding to the door, she took once last glance back at the bed, where Sam had flipped over, completely covering both sides of the bed. She chuckled to herself. I'm going to have a hard time getting back in there , she thought. She slipped out the door, making sure to shut it gently behind her. Grace was standing in the hallway waiting for her, and the second Cassie had closed the door, Grace pounced on her, clinging on for dear life. Cassie was surprised, but allowed Grace to hold onto her as long as she wanted. When Grace finally let go, Cassie put her arm around her daughter, and whispered, \"Come on, let's go make some tea and talk.\" Grace nodded slowly and allowed her mom to lead her down to the kitchen. Cassie got busy making the tea, and when it was ready, they took their cups in the living room. Sitting down on the large couch, Cassie took a sip of her tea and looked expectantly at her daughter. The clock rang out 2 A.M. Glancing over at the clock that Sam had once wondered about, she smiled before bringing her attention back to her daughter. \"Is there something you wanted to talk about, Grace?\" Grace had been particularly quiet since the upstairs hallway. She took a deep breath. \"Mom, I don't want to go to college.\" Cassie was shocked into silence. Grace had always been a straight-A student, and had been accepted into 8 prestigious universities. The whole family had thrown her a party when she was accepted at her top choice—Yale. \"I mean, I love Middleton. It's my home. My family is here…you're here.\" Grace choked out. Cassie reached out to her daughter and pulled her in close. She knew that Grace was having a difficult time with the idea of college, but she didn't know just how scared her daughter was. \"Grace, you can't let the fear of the unknown stop you from doing what you were meant to do. I know that you've been interested in going into the medical field. Haven't you liked working with Sam?\" Grace sighed. \"I've loved working at Sam's office. I guess that's part of the problem…I don't want to give up what I already have.\" Just then Cassie felt, and then saw, her husband shuffling up behind them. His hair was sticking straight up and he was a little scruffy, but the sight of him always took her breath away. He placed his hands on her shoulders before turning to Grace. \"Sorry to interrupt. I woke up when I realized that there were no icy feet keeping me cold.\" All three of them chuckled. \"I couldn't help but overhear, though. You're thinking no college?\" He stepped around the couch and sat in the chair next to it to give Cassie and Grace some space. \"I've been thinking about you lately, Grace. Back a couple of years ago Nick mentioned that you wanted to go to college, but also that you were more of a homebody.\" Sam continued, \"I could tell that you were a little hesitant about leaving, so I made some calls.\" Grace popped her head up, confused. At this point, Cassie looked at Sam in surprise. Sam just smiled at her and continued. \"Well, you were accepted into Northwestern, correct?\" Grace nodded, still wondering what Sam was going on about. \"Well,\" he continued, \"It turns out that Northwestern just started a satellite branch in Blairsville, and the dean of Biological Science and Research there is an old friend of mine from college.\" A smile bloomed on Cassie's face, as realization dawned on Grace's. She looked between Cassie and Sam, eyes wide. \"You mean that I could still go to college and stay at home?\" Sam grinned as he looked at Grace fondly, \"Of course, if you want to. I mean, you'd have to go to the main campus in Chicago eventually, especially if you want to go further than a Bachelor's degree, but you can knock out some prerequisite classes a little closer to home. I spoke with Jack and explained your internship and he's pretty impressed. He's happy to meet with you if you decide to stay.\" Grace launched out of her seat, surprising everyone, and threw her arms around Sam. He looked shocked for a second before wrapping his arms around his stepdaughter and patting her on the back. He glanced at his wife sitting on the couch, watching them fondly. Grace eventually let go and stepped back with a huge grin on her face. \"Thank you, Sam! I can't believe it. I'm going to accept the offer to Northwestern. They gave me the best scholarship, anyway. I can keep working at the clinic, too, if you need me.\" Sam smiled and nodded. Grace smiled and gave her mom a quick hug. \"Sorry to wake you both up. I couldn't sleep, and I knew I wouldn't until I talked this through. Thanks, guys. \" She gave Sam another quick hug. \"Goodnight.\" With that, Grace skipped upstairs. Cassie and Sam chorused their \"goodnights\" as they rose slowly from their seats, reached for the other's hand, and began their trek back upstairs. \"That was pretty amazing, what you did for her,\" Cassie remarked, amazed. Sam smiled, \"I guess you're rubbing off on me.\" Cassie stopped on the stairs, essentially tugging him back as he tried to continue walking. Surprised, Sam looked back. \"You're something else, you know, Dr. Radford?\" Sam smirked and shrugged before pulling his wife in for a quick kiss. \"'I learned from the best.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer—I wrote this for myself, but I decided to share.

It was 3am, and he had spent all night in the hospital. He been awake for 20 hours, and he could feel his body shutting down, which was why he initially thought he must have been imagining things when he saw a light on in the living room over at Grey House. Shaking his head, he frowned when he realised that the light was, indeed, on, and headed over, concerned that something was wrong. Cassie always left the foyer light on, so that guests could come and go, but the rest of the bed and breakfast was normally in darkness. As he approached, he glanced through the window, tapping on it lightly when he saw Grace curled up on the sofa, fully dressed (including shoes), reading a book. Grace glanced up at the noise, raised a hand in greeting, and slipped to her feet to let Sam in, leading him back into the sitting room. \"Is everything okay?\" Sam asked, as they both took a seat on the sofa. Grace sighed. \"Today will be the 6th anniversary of daddy's death,\" she revealed sadly. \"Oh Grace, I'm sorry, I didn't realise. Are you having trouble sleeping?\" Grace chewed on her lip for a moment, unsure if she should share the real reason for her midnight reading session with the man who had only started dating her mom recently. \"It's mom,\" she revealed eventually. \"The night that dad died, she got a feeling that he had been badly hurt at about four in the morning. She ran out of the house right to where he had been killed. And now, every year, she gets that same feeling. But, it's like she doesn't really wake up. The first year she made it all the way down to Main Street. Luckily, Derek found her and brought her home. The following year, she got on to the front drive, where Brandon intercepted her on his way home from a night out. Now we take it in turns waiting up, so we can get to her before she leaves the house.\" Shrugging, she looked down at her hands, waiting for Sam to ask the questions he wanted to ask. \"Does she know that this happens?\" \"She never remembers it,\" Grace replied. \"We had to tell her because we can't get her back upstairs on our own; she fights us to try and get out of the house until she tires. Whoever is up puts her on the sofa, and stays with her until morning. She didn't know why she was waking up in a different room to where she went to bed, so we had to explain it to her. She's tried everything she can think of to stop it happening; she even went to the Doctor's for prescription sleeping pills! But nothing worked.\" Sam frowned, hardly able to understand how bad it must be for Cassie, the poster girl for alternative medicines, to ask a Doctor for help. As they sat in silence, a shout came from upstairs, and in an instant Grace was on her feet and standing in front of the door. Sam could only watch as a distressed Cassie came running down the stairs, and straight into Grace's outstretched arms, pinning her against the door. Cassie continued to struggle, trying to break free from her daughter's embrace, and the tears started to cascade down the teenager's cheeks, as she mourned the moment that her beloved father lost his life. Sam stepped forward to try and help, but Grace shook her head. If she moved now, her mom would get out. So Sam stood helplessly for another three minutes, until exhaustion flooded through Cassie's body, and she sagged into Grace's arms, who slowly lowered them to the floor, running her hands through her mother's hair as they both wept. Eventually, Grace composed herself, and struggled to her feet. She hooked her arms under Cassie's and tried to pull her upright, but a hand on her shoulder stopped her. \"Hey,\" Sam whispered, \"Let me help.\" Grace nodded, suddenly remembering that Sam had seen the whole thing, and watched as he easily lifted Cassie into his arms, the sleeping woman automatically wrapping her arms around his neck. \"You go to bed, Grace,\" Sam insisted. \"I can look after your mom.\" Too tired to argue, Grace pressed a kiss to her mother's head, nodded gratefully at Sam, and headed back up the stairs. Sam adjusted his grip on Cassie as he considered his options. He could easily carry her up to her bed, but he didn't want to leave her alone, and he didn't feel comfortable just climbing into bed with her for the first time on the anniversary of her husband's death when she was asleep. So instead, he walked over to the sofa and tried to place her down on it, pausing when she wouldn't unclasp her hands from around his neck, forcing him to think of an alternative solution. As the morning Sun lit up the sitting room, Cassie stirred, immediately feeling that she was curled up against a warm body. She couldn't remember whose turn it was to wait up this year. She thought it was Grace's, but the person she was lying on was decidedly more masculine. Brandon, maybe? Confused, she slowly opened her eyes to see Sam looking down at her. She was sat across his lap, with her head resting against his shoulder, one hand over his heart, which she could feel beating steadily. \"Sam?\" she whispered. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Hey,\" he replied softly, running a hand up and down her back. \"I got home late last night and saw a light on so I came over to check everything was okay. Grace told me what today was. I didn't realise; I'm sorry.\" Seeing an embarrassed flush spread over Cassie's face, which she tried to hide by averting her gaze, Sam gently hooked a finger under her chin, encouraging her to look back up at him. \"Hey, it's okay,\" he said. \"I don't like people seeing me like this,\" she admitted. \"It's bad enough that the kids see me, and have to look after me when they're mourning their dad too, but people always see me as someone that they can rely on. I prefer that.\" \"That's still how I see you,\" Sam reassured her, \"But you're allowed to want a bit of comforting too. That's what I'm here for. I won't think any less of you, I promise.\" When Cassie nodded, Sam leant forward and pressed a gentle kiss to her lips, which she immediately returned. As they broke apart, she seemed to compose herself. \"Would you like some tea?\" she asked. Smiling, Sam replied without hesitation. \"As long as it's the one that tastes like coffee.\" A/N: I recently discovered Good Witch on Netflix, and have just fallen in love with the show and the characters, especially Cassie!

The poem was beautiful, the wedding touching and the carriage ride to the country club was romantic. But Sam isn't normally the type to get caught up in a whirl-wind of romance. What happened in Chicago that made Sam reconsider the future of his relationship with Cassie? Disclaimer: Characters owned by Hallmark. I just borrow them now and again! Shifting Gears \"Sam?\" Cassie frowned as she stepped out of the bedroom and tucked her phone into her pocket. The empty wine glasses and remnants of their dinner were on the table now and the fireplace had been turned down, but Sam was nowhere in sight. \"Out here,\" he called, reaching back to slide open the balcony door and gesturing for her to join him on the divan. She paused in the doorway. He looked at home, sleeves rolled up, tie loosened and that familiar cup of coffee in his firm grip. As usual, his blue eyes were observing everything and rarely still as he rested his elbows on his knees and studied the scene below him. From the 20th floor, the lights of Chicago glimmered and the sounds and smells of the city surrounded them. \"Cassie,\" he interrupted her thoughts. \"Everything Ok at home?\" A slight furrow creased his brow. Her phone call had lasted longer than expected. \"Just a little teenage drama, you know.\" \"Oh yes, drama I know all about.\" He nodded knowingly, a wry smile crossing his handsome features. That was something that had drawn them together early in their friendship. With both of them being single parents to teenagers, the challenges of raising kids had been a frequent topic of conversation. But not tonight. Everyone at home in Middleton was safe and Cassie was set to enjoy the peace and quiet of just the two of them for the next hour or so before Sam headed back. She herself would stay in town one more day, wrapping up the last of her buying trip for the store. Cassie slipped off her shoes before settling in beside him and tucking her feet underneath her. She loved sitting next to him, her back pressing into his side and his strong arm slipping around her waist instinctively to pull her closer. Resting her head against his shoulder, she inhaled the smell of his aftershave and the lingering scent of the hospital which created a fragrance that was uniquely Sam. They would sit like that for hours in the sitting room at Grey House, reading, watching a movie or just sitting quietly. No words were necessary, just the feeling of being safe and close in their embrace. They sat quietly for a few moments, listening to the pulse of the city. It was a cool, calm night and the patios and rooftop restaurants were full of hardy folks out enjoying a rare still autumn night in the windy city. The sounds of their revelry buzzed in the distance. \"Do you miss the city?\" Cassie asked. It had been just over two years since Sam had relocated from New York City to Middleton with his teenage son, Nick \"I do, or at least parts of it I do. I miss reading on the commute into Manhattan and I miss catching the Nicks games at O'Leary's pub in between shifts. But I can't say I miss the noise anymore. The first few weeks in Middleton I couldn't sleep because it was so quiet. Now I kind of miss the quiet.\" Cassie heard, rather than saw the gentle smile on his face as he spoke of his new home…their home. It was the same for Cassie. She had travelled the world before inheriting her great-great-grandmother's Grey House and moving to Middleton. In that small town she'd finally found something she'd searched the world over for…..a soul mate in her first husband Jake, 3 wonderful children and a life unlike anything she had ever imagined. The youngest, Grace was a young woman now, almost 17 years old. In a few years, the big house would be empty and for Cassie, resuming her exploration of the world would be a real possibility again. But somehow, she couldn't really imagine leaving Middleton. Jake was gone and her children were almost grown, but there was something else holding her there. She always thought it was the magic of Grey House, the wonderful people she met each day at her bed and breakfast and at her store, Bell Book and Candle. But more recently it was the unexpected joy of finding love again with Dr. Sam Radford. And maybe that was why in the safety of his arms she whispered the words almost without thinking into the night air. \"Sam, please stay tonight.\" She felt rather than saw the shift in his countenance – the slight hesitation in his breathing, the tension in his body. \"Cassie, I don't...\" his voice dwindled and she turned to face him, her dark eyes searching his. He cleared his throat, before looking away. \"I have rounds at noon tomorrow. I should get back.\" \"And I have a meeting at the store so I'd planned to go back early. We have plenty of time.\" But Cassie knew the hospital and the store were just words, excuses. She and Sam had never spent a night together, never expressed their feelings in that way. It hadn't been a conscious decision to wait. They'd always said it was timing and when you had two impressionable teenage kids and a houseful of guests at the house, not to mention her father-in-law George and cousin Abigail, a business and a medical career, there simply wasn't much time. But more than timing, perhaps it was a reluctance on both their parts to open themselves up to that kind of love and the hurt that could come with it. So in that way, Cassie had surprised herself a little, asking him to stay. Their future together was less certain after the events of the last couple of days. Sam had told her quite clearly that marriage was something he couldn't do again. She had witnessed his struggles with his ex-wife first-hand and understood why he would feel that way, but it still hurt. Just because his first marriage had ended badly, didn't mean a future relationship would also end in divorce. Didn't he trust their feelings enough to try again? Or was he afraid that she would hurt him? Her close friend Olympia had mentioned that at tea earlier in the week. Jake had been an undeniable force in Cassie's life and losing him had almost broken her. Olympia had suggested that it was hard for Sam to compete with the memory of a first and all-consuming love and a near-perfect marriage. Cassie had met Jake when she was just 23. She was a dreamer and he a realist – widowed at 32 and raising 2 children. For her it had been true first love – intense, passionate and almost overwhelming at times becoming a step-mother to Laurie and Brandon and eventually giving birth to Grace, not to mention the struggles of fitting into the town of Middleton. For Jake, Cassie had been his second chance. And although he'd loved Jenny very much, there was something special about finding love again when you least expected it. Jake had seized the opportunity by proposing early in their relationship and they'd made the most of the 13 years they'd shared as husband and wife. Although their time together had ended way too soon, there were no regrets. Jake had been her everything and even in death he seemed to be with her at every turn in her life. Jake would have liked Sam, she was sure of it. And more than anything, Jake would have wanted her to be happy. \"I'm not sure this is the right time, Cassie.\" She felt him pull away and she let him go as he placed the empty coffee mug on the floor before straightening and moving to the railing. She stood behind him, wanting to touch him but giving him space. \"Why, not?\" The question was simple, but as he turned to face her, the look in his eyes told her that the answer was not. \"Cassie,\" he reached for her, and she took his hands. He looked at their joined hands before raising his eyes to meet hers. \"I didn't…\" He shook his head, \"I didn't come to Chicago for this. Not that I don't want you,\" he rushed to reassure her, \"Because I do, but that wasn't why I came.\" Cassie waited patiently for him to continue. \"I didn't like how things were between us after the marriage conversation. I love you, and I don't want to lose you over this. I'm sorry, I just…\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Sam,\" she reassured him. \"I am not going anywhere. I got ahead of myself, that's all. This, you and I,\" she gestured between them, \"it's unexpected for both of us and I was rushing ahead. I'm sorry too. Let's just enjoy what we have right now, in this moment. Please stay.\" He studied her carefully. \"Are you sure about this, Cassie? I'm not sure I can step back after tonight.\" He was right. To go back to being 'just friends' or casually dating would be impossible. Tonight was a turning point in their relationship. Were they on the right path? Her gaze fell to his hands, strong, yet delicate, having saved so many lives as a trauma surgeon in New York. Maybe those hands had saved her life, and helped her to move forward. But forward to where? Where were they going? This wasn't a casual fling, there was too much at stake. She wasn't ready to risk their friendship and neither was he. Was she really sure about this? As the questions came, the panic began to rise a bit. Cassie took a deep breath to re-centre herself, closing her eyes and focussing on the feeling of standing with him on the balcony in her stocking feet, her hands wrapped in his. Her thoughts went back to her earlier conversation with Olympia - living in the moment, rather than worrying about what was to come. At this particular moment she really only needed to be sure about a few things, that she was safe in his hands and that she loved him and he loved her. It was really quite simple. She nodded then, smiling shyly as she looked into his eyes. Her confidence increased as he tightened his grip on her, pulling her close. She raised an eyebrow. \"And what about you. Are you sure, Sam?\" The way he looked at her was different than only a moment earlier. It was as if he had left his heart unguarded for the first time. She saw things that she had never noticed before. The way his gaze caressed her face and settled at her mouth before narrowing and returning to her eyes. The change in his breathing. The air between them was suddenly charged and filled with possibilities. \"Yes.\" He nodded, \"I am sure.\" Then his hand was sliding up the length of her arm, to settle at the nape of her neck. He pulled her to him in much the same way he had at the lake house so many months ago. There was a certain desperation in his movement. He needed her the way he needed air. And the first time that had scared them both a little and they had retreated. But things had changed. This time it felt right and there was no question in her mind about where she wanted this night to go. Despite the chilly night air, she felt the familiar heat rush through her body, a combination of his physical closeness and the way he looked at her just now. And then they were kissing. It felt so different than the other times. There was no holding back, his mouth hot and urgent against her lips as she kissed him back. Breathless they parted, foreheads resting against one another, as they held each other tight in the dim light of the Chicago night. She wasn't sure if it was her heart racing, or his as they both spoke at once and then stopped. She laughed, \"You first, Sam.\" He reached for the hem of her sweater, his hands sliding beneath the fabric briefly brushing her skin before settling at the curve of her waist. Her breath caught slightly and she noticed his fleeting grin as she reacted to his touch. She smiled to herself, thinking of the many ways that she could make him pay for that smug expression. \"I was just thinking,\" he began, his voice hoarse, edgy, and she had to say it - extremely sexy. \"That maybe we ought to take this inside?\" ","Summary":" Like many viewers, I was a little surprised by the events of the Season 3 finale.

Or, not too much trouble, anyway. Cassie Nightingale is her family – the Russell children are her family and that still means something to her. So she'll stir the pot, she'll be the bad guy – because Cassie, for everything she knows and can see, is surprisingly blind about what concerns herself. She's in New York when she feels the urge to visit her cousin. So she pulls up roots, leaves her apartment and catches a bus. Sam Radford, Dr. Sam Radford, is one of the first people she runs into, and suddenly everything becomes clear. It takes a bit of effort to stop herself from bouncing a little and clapping her hands excitedly – Sam is a hottie – and exactly what Cassie needs. She makes conversation, feeling him out – he seems only too happy to deliver her to Grey House, and Abigail knows that it's not on her account. Cassie is Cassie – still stunning, still wary and still so blind . Lori is wary, Grace is excited and the Doc's kid is stunned (hey, she can't blame the kid, she is kind of fabulous). She also doesn't miss that his son expects his dad to be next door. It's a great sign. Abigail can barely contain her excitement – it's very rare that she's been a step ahead of Cassie and she is going to enjoy this. ::: Of course, that is before she meets (so to speak) Ryan and Stephanie. ::: Abigail wonders why she ever thought anything to do with her cousin was going to be easy. She's trying to think of the best way to finagle things between her cousin and the love of the rest of her life while she helps Grace and Lori. Okay, maybe meddle , is the better word. Maybe. She decides to make a preemptive move on the Stephanie front and works her way into becoming Sam's new receptionist. Abigail can see the claws come out from a mile off; it's a little hilarious (she has no regrets - that perfume is bitching, Cassie has fantastic taste). She has to admit the muffins are a nice touch (she's not allergic, but has no qualms about making sure they never go anywhere near Sam) – but Cassie is her cousin, and she'll be damned if she lets some bleached blonde bimbo step in on her cousin's turf. Okay, so Stephanie's actually pretty smart; and probably a real blonde. That's completely beside the point, though. She's still not going near her cousin's man. Abigail loves Cassie – so she's willing to sacrifice a heel and delay Sam a little (what's an hour or two in the scheme of things?). If it has the added benefit of Sam crashing Cassie and Ryan's dinner, well, that's just a bonus. A great bonus – the story of beautiful Cassie Nightingale sharing a torte with two of Middleton's most eligible bachelors does the rounds really quickly. She gets home and realizes that her work with Grace and Lori is complete – baby Russell probably won't try to grow up too quickly again anytime soon, and that's a great thing, the girl is really not cut out to be a rebel. Lori's got her big-sister boots on, which will leave Cassie free to pursue something (everything) with Sam. She is awesome . ::: Actually, she sucks. Sam's invited Stephanie over for dinner. At his house. That throws a wrench in her plans before Sam extends an unexpected lifeline. He can't cook. Abigail very generously offers to help, mentioning that one of her exes had taught her everything she knew. Not that she intends to extend that knowledge on to Sam. He's a doctor, so it doesn't take much to convince him that all he needs is a recipe. Men. One disaster averted, she turns her mind on how to knock some sense into Ryan. The man doesn't seem to understand that his friendship with Cassie is the best thing that could have happened to him – taking it any further will destroy that. She's feeling pretty smug when she gets back to Grey House. Cassie tries to sneak up on her (it's a game that Abigail plays, Cassie wins more often than not, which is annoying , considering she doesn't realize she's meant to be playing) and seems to be pretty upset. Aah, Grace 'fessed up. She gets into it with Cassie, is frustrated enough that she blurts it all out. Sam is Cassie's, just as Cassie is Sam's. Her cousin is just too blind to see it. Of course Abigail realizes it's a mistake as soon as she says it. She tries to head Ryan off at the pass, but she hears him come into the kitchen, and shamelessly eavesdrops. Ugh , her cousin can be so frustrating. Abigail isn't giving up though – she may have lost this battle, but there's still a war to be fought. Cassie Nightingale and Sam Radford belong together. She just has to make them see it.

When Nick decides to run and catch up with Grace and Courtney, it's because he sees them laughing. Initially, on the walk from school, he figured he'd let them have some girl time—if Grace was even with Courtney, he thought. She wasn't by his locker waiting for him or just outside the front doors, so he assumed she had found her other friend and took off. It bothered him only a little bit, something he didn't let himself dwell too much on. It wasn't as if Grace could only talk to him, but he pretty much only talked to her; which wasn't a problem until Courtney started hanging around. And that's not even fair, because Courtney's kind and funny and fits right in with them, but Nick has really grown to enjoy the one-on-one dynamic with Grace. He ends up quite a ways behind the two girls, alternating between staring at the sidewalk or at Grace's shoes. (Or Grace . . . no, it's definitely her shoes.) His mind is flipping back and forth from wanting to say 'screw it' and walk with them anyway, and about how lost he is when it comes to his bio homework. Or bio in general. His friends' laughter floats into his eardrums and for a split second, he wonders if they're talking about him. How they feel about him. It's a ridiculous notion, one that he knows is completely false, but his heart still thumps at the thought and his feet still speed up to a jog until he's beside them. When he asks where they're going, it's mostly because the answer is probably 'home' and then he'll have an excuse to stay right where he is, right by Grace's side. And Courtney splitting off immediately after to head to her own home is just the icing on the cake. Nick watches Courtney walk across the street for an appropriate amount of time before turning back to Grace. \"So. What'd you guys do all day?\" His mind wanders to his locker, Graceless. And why didn't you wait for me? Okay, that's stupid. She doesn't have to wait for him. (But he'll wait for her.) She sighs and begins a shortened summary. \"School. Then walking home from school.\" Grace keeps speaking, but Nick barely has enough control to know when to tear his eyes away from her, and his ears tune out a bit to what she's actually saying. Just listening to her voice is enough for him. He hears when she brings up Courtney, and he thanks the chance to slip in inviting him next time. Her \"of course\" puts him at ease. She'll always have time for him. But he knows that he missed her today, and it sets him right back on edge. Why did he miss her? Six hours apart and he has the makings of separation anxiety? The textbooks in his backpack remind him of his other thought before he crashed the Girls' Day. \"Oh, hey, I got a biology test coming up; do you think you can help me study for it?\" Her eyes widen and she stops walking completely. \"Wait.\" Grace turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder before pressing the back of her hand against his forehead. \"Are you feeling okay?\" Nick vaguely realizes that his own hand is rising up to hold her side but then she touches his neck and his mind almost goes blank with buzzing noises. His hand keeps rising until it finds her arm, almost subconsciously. He doesn't even know what she's saying at this point. Both hands are on his shoulders now, and he's looking around, just to make sure the world isn't spinning. Everything looks dull in comparison to her. What's that about studying? Oh. Right. \"Yes, I actually decided I wanna know stuff, alright?\" His laughter continually escapes him and she's still touching him and oh God he doesn't want her to let go but if she doesn't he might lose a few brain cells. She removes her hands to his simultaneous relief and disappointment and begins spouting off when and where to meet her. Taken out of context, it almost sounds like she's planning a date. It's not a date. Shut up. / It's not a date. There are textbooks, and Teacher Grace, and a whole lot of studying—which he expected, because it's not a date— but there's still a part of him that had hoped for something else. It goes about as well as they anticipated, what with him knowing nothing and her knowing everything (and also because this is his second year in bio and she passed it with flying colors two years ago). Only about two (times eight) thoughts of dates and Grace and Grace on dates enters his mind, most of which he succeeds in turning away rather quickly. Sure, she looks absolutely beautiful in the pink jacket she's wearing, and whenever she laughs he's positive an angel gains its wings, and the flowers on the table would look better in her hair, but he's not thinking about that. (He's definitely thinking about that.) He thinks he's had the usual lack of focus thus far throughout their da—study session, and can only hope she doesn't (correctly) assume it's because of her. He genuinely can't stop looking at her and it's fucking with his mind a great deal, but she's still on about studying so as soon as she gets to the word 'eukaryotic,' he's serious and admits (in a less serious way) that he doesn't know what that is. \"There's no way that's a real word, you're making that up.\" \"No, no. It is right here, in the book.\" \"Well lemme see,\" he reasons, leaning a few inches closer to the book, and her, subsequently. \"No peeking!\" Grace's face twists into faux-anger and he works to make his smile gradually appear instead of instantaneously like a love drunk fool, watching her tug the book away from him. \"Come on, let me see that,\" he says, one hand following after the bio text she lifts up. \"No, no, no, you are supposed to know this,\" she teases, holding it just out of his reach and smiling, her amusement noticeable. \"I'd know it if you give me the book, Grace!\" And he makes a mistake. Or perhaps the mistake is a few seconds later. When his chair first moves and his arm stretches around behind her, she's giggling and he files it away as his favorite sound ever. The book is almost in his grasp but her laughter stops and she's looking at him and he stares for maybea second too long because she says, \"No,\" and his arm starts to retreat. There's still a playful lilt in her voice, but he knows something has shifted, and he knows it's his fault. Sometimes he catches himself wondering if she . . . feels the same things he does. It didn't use to be all the time; in fact, it was kind of rare. He found her optimism and knowledge (both natural and not-so-natural) a tad irritating. But somewhere along the line it changed to endearing and admirable and adorable and then how he felt was an around-the-clock type of thing and not just every once in awhile and it's times like these, well. It's times like these that he understands completely why he doesn't want other girls' attention, why it's not a problem he doesn't have a girlfriend or doesn't go on dates because who needs dates when you have this and— He moves away. \"Fine. I give up.\" And he thinks maybe he should, maybe his words ought to have another meaning when she switches the subject back into biology. But \"It's 'cause I got the best teacher in town\" tumbles out of his mouth before he can catch it and she has such a dismissive reaction to the overly-sweet sentence but he knows her, he knows she's pleased and flattered and— Would it really be such a bad thing if this were a date? He has to leave. There's a bit more flirtatious banter before he heads out, and the idea is all but forgotten in his mind. He's entertaining it, and he knows it might be a bad move, but that back there? That's not the only time Grace has seemed like she felt something. It's twenty minutes later when he caves and takes a risk and sends a text, wondering if he'll regret it as soon as it's done. [need to ask you something important. tomorrow okay?] / \"There's this girl that I wanna ask out and I'm…tryin' to figure out exactly what to say.\" Half the battle he has with himself centers around how the hell he's gonna do this. Normally he'd go to Grace with a problem like this, or possibly even Cassie, but the former is out for obvious reasons, and the latter would guess where he was coming from a mile away. He's freaking out and second-guessing himself enough as it is, and while he doesn't want to, it's a necessity to involve someone else in his internal conflict. So his last resort . . . is his father. His dad's old-fashioned advice is to, quite frankly, ask the girl out, but with flowers. The issue with that (besides the old-timey vibe it's sure to give off) is that Grace knows him, and bringing flowers to someone who's been your best friend for two years now seems fake. And anyways, she'd get suspicious right off the bat, and if he is to go through with this preposterous idea, then the element of surprise is his friend. But the only surprise is that it's taken him this long to do something about how he feels. / They're just entering the garden when he manages to get the words \"So there's something I need to talk to you about\" out without vomiting. \"Oh yes, I know. And I know exactly what you're going to say.\" Her eyes are wide and while her demeanor hasn't changed his heart still nearly stops. \"Wh-How can you already know that?\" he fumbles, hoping it's not obvious he's on the brink of emptying the contents of his stomach and hightailing it out of there. \"I mean, I have a feeling,\" she confides in him, eyes flickering to his face for no longer than two seconds. He finds himself forcing out a laugh. \"You and your 'feelings.'\" Dear Lord how did I not think she'd get a 'feeling' about this too? \"Look Nick, we are…you know, you—you mean a lot to me.\" She knows. \"Okay…\" \"And we are really good friends.\" The emphasis may be on another word but he swears he can hear his heart break at 'friends.' \"Yeah, that's why I'm here.\" Because we're such good friends that we could be more. Because we're such good friends I don't want to be just that. Because we're not just that. Can't you feel it? \"Right, so let's say that something were to get in the middle of that friendship…\" She knows, she knows, she fucking knows. He's chosen flight over fight and his mind rewires his statement completely before he can decide whether he wants to just own up to how he feels and suffer the consequences or shut his damn mouth and never try again. \"Ohhh, I'm starting to see where this is going.\" Holy hell, of course he knows where this is going. \"Oh no.\" And he looks at her, really just looks at her, and she seems so scared. So genuinely afraid to lose her best friend and his heart breaks for a second time . \"Oh no no, shoot, Abigail told me,\" she's mumbling now, but he always hears her, \"I was supposed to shift over—\" And he takes the jump, both knowing he'll look back and hoping that maybe this is a sign. \"You think that me asking Courtney out is gonna get in the way of me and you being friends.\" They've stopped walking by now, and it pains him to get the words out, but he knows it's the right way to go. Clearly Grace doesn't want anything to change between them, and the last thing he wants to do it purposely pressure her, but…is this really how he wants to get out of it? Courtney's pretty, and sweet, and from the few times his dad has seen her he knows Sam would approve. Nick likes talking to her, she has a nice sense of humor, and she isn't complicated like someone. He thinks that maybe this is for the best, and that maybe it will end up being way better than what he had originally planned to do today. When Grace turns to him and clarifies, \"You wanna ask Courtney out,\" he can hear the relief in her voice and his twice-broken heart crumbles to pieces. Is the thought of him being romantically interested in her that bad? He bullshits some reason as to why and automatically regrets saying, \"But you don't even think I should ask her,\" when she quickly jumps at the chance to say he should. Yep. The thought's that bad. He gets even worse advice on how to ask someone out from her than from his father, and then she walks off, smile wiping from her face the second she starts to turn away from him. A tiny sliver of him wishes to analyze what that means; did she partially want him to go through with it? Is she jealous? Is she confused? But he shakes the thoughts of his head and chooses instead to wonder if he can just skip over asking Courtney out completely, but he knows he won't. This will be a good distraction from Grace, and who knows? If she says yes, then he could develop genuine feelings for her and have an amazing girlfriend. Except, his brain nags at him, she's not Grace. Shut up. I don't have to be with Grace. Right. He just wants to be. / At first, all he knows is extreme, immense relief. And then it sets in, and he asks what the fuck? He picked flowers. He made sure he looked presentable. And he asked Courtney out (albeit, almost everything was mumbled). Ultimately, he had ended up asking, \"Would you like to go on a date with me?\" and it's the simplicity of it that gets him. He might not have gone into the situation with Grace earlier that day knowing what he was going to say, but it wouldn't have been that. He would have involuntarily started grinning like an idiot, would have complimented her hair or her personality or basically blubbered on and on until all that was comprehensible was just how much he loves her. But with Courtney, it's not like that. There's no way it could be like that. She smiles the whole way throughout his nearly-inaudible proposal, and then…she kindly turns him down. What? It's awkward, to say the least. Not only does she say no to going on a date with him, but he is so unbelievably thankful for it that it's bordering on inappropriate. Of course, leaving someone's house after being rejected is uncomfortable, but the weight being lifted off Nick's chest is incredible. The walk home is full of whistling and thoughts of Grace (as per usual). / When Courtney shows up at his door two hours later, he's so sure he's having a nightmare. He thought he dodged a bullet. He told his dad at dinner that, yeah, he's not going on a date any time soon, but he's okay with that. He spent the past two hours playing video games and scrolling through social media and wondering if it'd be okay to visit Grace over at Grey House yet. He did not foresee Courtney coming over and explaining why she turned him down, and the reason why gives him all sorts of mixed feelings. On one hand, he's grateful that SOMEONE can see the connection he has with Grace, that it isn't all in his head. If her female best friend thought she had feelings for Nick, then there could really be some truth to that and not just a hormonal teenage boy's biased opinion. But as soon as Courtney utters the words, \"Grace cleared it up for me,\" his heart sinks. 'Cleared it up'? Was he nothing more than some insignificant item to cross off her checklist? Maybe all that contemplating he had done after he lied to her was actually over nothing. Grace herself had said she had no feelings for him. She could be lying; after all, he didn't currently have romantic emotions towards Courtney. But Grace doesn't lie. Grace only breaks hearts. Review! ","Summary":" My heart hurts.

Cassie was surrounded by pots, pans and other cooking aids as she finished up dinner in the kitchen. Alexander had tucked himself away in a corner chair by the window, with clear views of his mother and his sister outside in front of the basketball hoop. He liked the sport and might have been out with his sibling, but found more interest and comfort in keeping an eye on his family and his nose in a book. \"Alex,\" Cassie questioned, \"Where's your sister?\" \"Outside. Basketball.\" He said nonchalantly. She chuckled and answered, \"Ok.\" Her twins' apparent indifference for each other bothered Cassie; they had barely spent two seconds away from one another's company since they were born. She heard the familiar sound of a bouncing ball outside and knew he was home. \"Mama! Dad's home!\" Alex said excitedly. \"Oh, good,\" she answered seeing him bound towards the door. \"Wait until he gets into the house before you start bombarding him, alright?\" \"Oh, ok, I will,\" he said stopping in his tracks, looking back at his mother with a minor look of disappointment looming on his face. Cassie chuckled a bit as her son returned to his perch and buried himself back into his reading material. Sam carefully pulled into the driveway, seeing his daughter in front of the hoop. He smiled proudly as she had appeared to continue the Radford affinity for his favourite sport; and, like him and Nick, it had already become a way to vent when she was upset or think when confused. Something had to be on her mind, he thought. Cassie had mentioned to him that she had noticed something different about the twins, now Sam was sure that she was right. Perhaps a talk with his daughter would shed some more light on their concerns. \"Hey princess,\" Sam said closing the car door and placing his hands up for a pass. \"Hi Daddy!\" Elizabeth replied, throwing the ball and running for a hug from her father. He caught the ball and bent down just in time to embrace his daughter. \"I missed you while you were at the hospital today,\" she said out of the blue. \"I missed you too, as always,\" he answered. Catching an unfamiliar look on face, he asked, \"Hey my girl, what's up?\" \"I don't know, Daddy. I…I just…I really miss you when you go to work at the hospital and I'm really…happy when you're back,\" she said hesitantly, as if she wanted to say more but wasn't. \"Well, I'm very, very happy that you're happy when I get home from the hospital,\" he smiled, picked up the ball again and gave it to her. After a moment, he added, \"Lizziebeth?\" \"Yeah, Daddy.\" Looking into her eyes, the same ones that stared back at him every day in a mirror, he continued, \"Any particular reason you're glad when I come home from the hospital? I am happy that you miss me because I miss you when I'm at work even when it's not at the hospital.\" \"Hospitals aren't fun,\" she simply answered. \"People who are hurt or sick go there.\" \"Well, that's true,\" Sam admitted to her, \"but that's why I'm there. I'm a doctor and I want to help make them better.\" \"I know. I just like knowing you're home,\" she said, wrapping her arms tight around his neck. \"Ok, ok,\" he said holding her. \"I like coming home to you, your Mom, brothers and sister too, so we're even.\" They separated and Elizabeth smiled, content for the moment. \"I've been practising,\" she said, \"let me show you.\" \"Ok, quick demo. We don't want to keep your Mama and Alex waiting for us.\" They both eyed the ball and made a dash to see who could get to it first. Cassie listened to the repetitive sound of a bouncing ball and knew that her young daughter's worries had been eased—for the moment. She remembered when her mother had first talked to her about the Merriwicks, and when she had first talked to Grace. It looked like she may to think about it again with Elizabeth, explaining about her namesake and their lineage. Elizabeth may not be the only one, she suddenly considered, looking over to her only biological son. Males of the Merriwick line were rarely mentioned in the stories she had heard growing up. She knew he was smart—as smart as his father; she knew he was kind—as kind as her own father, his namesake; but she was the Merriwick, not her husband, not her father and she could only wonder what that meant for Alexander, if anything, would certainly come as a surprise. For the first time, she didn't know what to expect. The bedtime ritual for the Radford twins took time. Once Elizabeth and Alexander were settled in their room and in their beds, however, it was family time. Sam had stopped working late shifts at Hillcrest when they were born so he could be there for them. The children had never known an evening without their father. \"We finished Seabiscuit last night,\" Elizabeth announced looking directly at her brother. \"Now it's my turn to choose, right Mama?\" \"Yes, Lizzie, it's your turn.\" The little girl rubbed her hands together excitedly and went to the bookcase. She scanned the shelves seriously until her hand landed on the one she wanted. Cassie smiled upon receiving the book. Alex had also caught the title of the book. \"A girly book, really,\" he complained. \"The Tarynsville books are not girly, sport\" Sam cut-in. \"Your brother played the prince when the whole of Middleton was transformed into the town one Halloween.\" Cassie smiled at the memory of that special Halloween. That night she had dreamt of a future with Dr. Sam Radford. \"Nick read these too,\" the boy said, his eyes lighting up at the shock of the possibility and mention of his brother. \"Well, no\" Sam had to admit, \"but he did see the movies and liked them no matter what he says.\" \"Then I'll wait 'til you and Mama let me see the movies,\" he said crossing his arms sternly and looking at his mother and sister. \"Alexander Samuel,\" Cassie said with a firm calmness in her voice that the boy understood immediately. \"You know the rules. Your sister chose this book, just as you chose the last one, and it is the bedtime story. Yes?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good. Let's begin.\" Cassie snuggled around her youngest daughter and began to read while Sam put his arm around his son with a final look that told the boy he was in agreement with Cassie. Surrendering to his parents' rule, he leaned into his father's chest, closed his eyes, and listened to his mother's soothing voice as she read the story about the town that was eternally stuck in Halloween. Elizabeth glanced at her brother, who already seemed like he was asleep. Her father listening intently with a look of pure love for his wife, who brought the story of the young woman and enchantress to life. It was times like this when she was most happy and loved—her family around her. Cassie had finished the chapter and both children were properly tucked in when she and Sam clicked off the lights and leaving, with one last look at their sleeping son and daughter, the door ajar. They walked into the main room, hands intertwined, and settle upon the couch for the evening. \"Something is up with our daughter, love,\" he said to her with concern written all over his face. \"She said an odd thing and it got me thinking,\" he paused. \"What Sam? What did she say? What's got you thinking?\" Cassie fired the questions. Over the years of knowing her husband, she had learned many things about him and one of those things was that he had extraordinary listening skills and could infer certain information from just hearing what someone had to say—perhaps that was why he was such a good doctor, father and person. \"She said she likes it when I am home from the hospital. That she doesn't like it there because people are sick and hurt.\" \"Well, a lot of children are scared of hospitals. That is normal.\" \"There's more. It wasn't just what she said, but how she said it.\" Cassie could see her husband playing the moment over and over in his mind. She loved his tenacity and when it came to worry for his children, it was intensified. \"Cassie?\" He suddenly asked. \"When did Grace begin showing signs of her…Merriwick intuition?\" Getting a thoughtful look on her face, Cassie said, \"I think it's always there. It's just learning what it means and how to act. That's what can take a lifetime.\" She was constantly amazed by her husband. In many ways he was still the sceptic that didn't believe in Eastern medicine, luck or even a bit of magic, but he always believed in her and by extension her daughter. For the first time, she could see, he was considering that maybe their daughter had inherited more from her mother than her compassion and kindness. They both looked at each other. \"Perhaps I should talk with her.\" \"Yeah, I think now might be a good time to tell her about her Merriwick ancestors.\" Sam kissed her on the cheek and opened his book. They both settled into each other and their evening habits. Some hours later, Elizabeth Radford lay in her bed, unable to fall back to sleep. Her twin brother slept soundly in the bed next to hers. A glow from low house lamps illuminated the hall enveloped her in warmth and safety, as it always had. From the moment she could crawl, Elizabeth was a mover. She was curious, adventurous, and always wanted to be someplace where she was not—she had grown up with stories of her mother's and Aunt Joanne's travels after all. At the moment, she wanted to be someplace other than her bedroom, other than her house. In an instant she was out of her bed quietly making her way out the door and over to the B and B that was only next door. Grey House was locked for the night, but Elizabeth knew the code to keypad that guests could use to enter after hours. Clad in pyjamas and slippers she found herself in the cosy Grey House living room staring up at the painting of her ancestor and namesake, Elizabeth Merriwick. Grace had always told her that she thought their mother resembled the Grey Lady, and as Elizabeth Radford stood there by the light of the fire, she couldn't agree more. Suddenly she had a familiar feeling. \"Mama,\" she said without turning around. Cassie appeared by her side. \"Lizzie, what are you doing here at this time of night?\" Her voice was, once again, calm yet stern. Elizabeth was well aware that she had done something she should not have, but also that she was not in too much trouble—at least that was what she hoped. \"I couldn't sleep. I just had to be here.\" Mother and daughter moved to the couch, Cassie letting her continue. \"You and Daddy named me after her, right?\" she said, eyes still fixed on the painting. \"Why?\" \"Well, your Dad chose your name, actually,\" she explained, giggling to herself as the memory came back to her. \"Daddy named me?\" \"Yes, and I named your brother,\" she said honestly. She pulled Elizabeth close to her. \"You and your brother are the best things that your father and I could have ever wished for in our lives.\" \"Mama, you and Grace are always telling us stories about Elizabeth and the other Merriwicks.\" Cassie nodded. \"Why?\" Her daughter was full of questions, Cassie thought. \"Well, they were some women in our family that did some amazing things. It's good to share those stories.\" Her younger daughter sighed heavily, looking at the Grey Lady. Sam was right, she realised, something was going on with their daughter as she saw the same look of concentration from the 8-year old that she had seen in both Sam and Nick at times. \"Elizabeth,\" she finally said. \"Your Dad wanted you to share your name with the Grey Lady because he knows all those stories too. Elizabeth Merriwick was an independent, strong, courageous woman who did some wonderful things while she lived. That's simply what we want for you—to be the best you can be and not let anything stand in your way.\" \"Thanks,\" she said smiling and hugged her mother tightly. \"I just wonder,\" she added pulling away from Cassie's arms \"I just wonder…is there anything …different about the Merriwicks?\" \"Different?\" Cassie questioned cautiously. \"How?\" \"Well, I always know when you, Daddy, Alex, Grace and Nicky are around before you announce yourselves. Alex notices it too and he even noted how Daddy and Nick don't seem to do this, but you and Grace do.\" Alexander, her observant son, Cassie should have known he would make the connection between the Merriwicks. \"So you and your brother have talked about this?\" \"Yeah, he was the first that noticed and told me,\" she admitted. \"Then I couldn't let it go.\" She thought about how much to tell, knowing full well that it would probably get back to her son as well. Not even Grace had been as direct about her Merriwick questions at this age; she had been a bit older. \"Sweet pea, every little piece of who we are comes from many, many people—our ancestors—and that makes us an individual.\" Elizabeth gave her a look and Cassie laughed. \"There, what you did just now. I've seen your father do that. Your tenacity is a Radford trait. You and your brother both share your father's grin and his shining blue eyes.\" \"Mama…\" Cassie raised her hand and continued, \"Your Dad would list all the things that he sees reflected in you from me; all these pieces from me, from him will determine who you are. You are a Radford, a Nightingale, a Merriwick and more. Yes, there are some Merriwick bits that are…special… and as a Merriwick, you may feel those differences, but they are what make you, Elizabeth Marie Radford. \"So, what I feel sometimes, we all have that?\" \"To some extent, yes. Generations of Merriwick women including me, cousin Abigail, my mother, and your sister have felt this way. Let me assure you, it's not something bad, but if something ever makes you worried or scared you can come to me or your Dad, ok?\" \"Daddy knows? He believes in you—us?\" \"He believes in all of us. He always will. That is just one of the reasons I love him so much.\" Cassie explained to her daughter with a knowing smile. Elizabeth, despite being a Merriwick, was also most certainly her father's daughter. \"Ok,\" Lizzie finally said as if her mother's explanation had answered her questions, turned back towards the portrait of the Grey Lady. \"You look like the Grey Lady and I'm named after her…that's pretty cool.\" Cassie laughed and kissed her youngest daughter, \"Yeah, pretty cool. Come on, let's get back home. Your brother will be missing you and your Dad will miss me.\" Quietly, so as not to disturb guests and other members of the family, Cassie and Elizabeth left Grey House. After tucking her daughter back in bed and kissing her son on the forehead, she slipped back into bed. She settled in and Sam rolled over, wrapping his arm around her. \"So, what happened to my two girls?\" he asked groggily. \"You know?\" \"I know my wife and daughter were not where they should be, yes, and you had five minutes before I started looking for you both.\" Cassie kissed him. \"Thank you. I'm sorry. I heard get up and followed her to Grey House.\" Sam looked surprised. \"Grey House. Why?\" \"You were right. She needed to see the Grey Lady and I needed to tell her a bit about her ancestry.\" \"A bit?\" \"Enough of what I felt she should know at this stage. Our twins are very aware of their differences…shall we say.\" \"Both of them?!\" \"Mmhmm.\" Sam lay back onto his pillow. \"Ok, where do we go from here?\" ","Summary":" .[Chapter 2] It was a fine summer day in Middleton.

But, it's more than just wedding jitters that has Middleton's beloved shop and B&B; owner all out of sorts…. Publish Date: September 2018 Author's Note: Just a very short story that has been resting in the back of my mind for quite some time! Enjoy! Monday Evening Grey House Middleton, IL The chiming of the clock rang quietly in the background as Cassie's nimble fingers made quick work of chopping the carrots for her homemade vegetable soup. The farmer's stand, just two blocks from Grey House, always provided the freshest produce, among a plethora of fresh honey, eggs, and cheeses the likes of which had never seen the interior of a big-box grocery store. She'd been a long-standing patronage of the farmer's market, preferring the freshness, as well as the low prices, and the knowledge she was supporting some of the residents of Middleton. That afternoon, she'd made a quick stop to stock up on the essentials, and to procure a bundle of vegetables necessary for soup. She scooped up the carrot fragments, dumping them into the pot of broth that simmered on the stove. With a sigh, she reached into the burlap sack on the counter to retrieve the bundle of potatoes. The distant chime reminded her, as it had the previous hour, and all the hours before, that time was quickly winding down to her wedding to Dr. Sam Radford. Yes, that Sam Radford; the same man who had blazed thru her front door and into her heart. Never mind the fact that he entered with the utmost aire of superiority and arrogance in his disapproval over her preferred home medicinal remedies. He'd blazed thru, all-assuming on what he knew, yet knowing nothing about her, or what made her tick. And yet, she'd allowed him to stay. Welcomed him, more like it. And as the memories of their first encounter swept thru her mind, she realized, with a shake of her head, her attention was focused on everything but chopping the potatoes. In just over a week, she and Sam were set to commit their trust and faithfulness to each other, in front of Mayor Martha, her own family, and some of her dearest friends in Middleton. She was more than ready to join Sam as his wife, her heart having said its final bittersweet, but long overdue, farewell to Jake. He had passed away over six years prior, and in response to his sudden death, Cassie's heart had gone dormant, assuming life would never bring her another man like Jake. And it didn't. Instead, it brought the arrogant, irascible horse's rear-end that was Sam, and she suddenly and inexplicably found herself mired in complicated matters of the heart. But it wasn't the ceremony, or bidding Jake farewell, or Sam moving in that had her heart all jumpy, her nerves frazzled, and her doubting herself. It was…something else. So wrapped up in her thoughts, her steadfast intuition and uncanny ability to sense people coming into the room before she saw them, failed her for the first time in a long while. \"Well good evening, cuz\" Abigail greeted as she breezed through the arched doorway, her sights already set on the tub of Ben and Jerry's® that was tucked on the bottom shelf of the freezer. She had just finished a large order of Gerber Daisy arrangements for Martha's Civics Club luncheon, and as such, it was, in her own eyes, way past time to reward herself with her favorite dessert. She pulled the box from its frozen tomb and grabbed a spoon from the cutlery drawer. Foregoing a bowl, she ate straight from the container. She talked over a mouthful of ice cream. \"Do you have any idea how annoying it is when the Mayor decides to increase her order of table arrangements, at the last minute?\". She sighed theatrically. \"It took me alllll morning to get those done, and not so much as a 'Thank you, Abigail, they look just splendid!' when I delivered them this afternoon\" She leaned against the counter, stabbing the contents of the container in mild frustration. \"All she said was, 'Well, at least you were on time for once! Practice makes perfect, you know!',\" Abigail mocked in her best imitation of Martha's signature high-pitched voice. She rolled her eyes in disgust. \"You'd think I'd get something besides a lecture on how I could improve\". Cassie merely shrugged in response, her brain too swallowed by other thoughts to come up with anything remotely helpful. She heeded her long-standing motto, 'If you can't say anything helpful, simply remain quiet'. In all honesty, she was hoping, for her sake, that Abigail would be too caught up in her own drama to notice the lack of verbal response. Unfortunately, she wasn't so fortunate. Abigail sensed the subdued demeanor of her cousin immediately and she set the container of ice cream aside. Normally, her cousin was upbeat, positive, and always had a line or two of sage advice to dispense. But over the course of the last few days, she'd noticed Cassie had been quieter, more reserved, than usual. She nudged Cassie with her hip. \"Alright, what gives?\". Feigning ignorance, Cassie kept her eyes on the potatoes. \"What are you talking about?\" Abigail pinned her with a deprecating look. \"You know what I'm talking about. For the past few days, you've been quiet and withdrawn\". Deciding that this conversation warranted complete abandonment of her ice-cream foray, she returned the lid to the box and dropped her dirty spoon in the dishwasher. \"What's going on?\" Cassie shook her head and flashed a smile in Abigail's direction, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. \"I've just got a lot left to do for the ceremony, that's all\". Abigail narrowed her eyes. \"Stephanie's providing the food, I'm doing your flowers, and Martha is officiating the ceremony. You've already picked out your dress. What else is there to get ready for?\" She merely shrugged, not sure she wanted to get into a lengthy or in-depth conversation about what exactly was on her mind. \"Cassie…you're not having second thoughts, are you?\". Abigail's own abilities were strong enough to provide her a fair amount of confidence that this was not the case, but something else nagged at her cousin….and she couldn't quite place it. For a moment, she wondered if Cassie was intentionally blocking her. Cassie's eyes went wide, and she relinquished her grip on the knife. \"NO! Oh no, never\". She immediately dropped her voice, fingering the towel she'd grabbed to wipe her hands. \"No second thoughts. I…had a long talk with Jake a few weeks ago\". Abigail rested her hand on her shoulder. \"Cassie, he would want you to be happy. He wouldn't want you to miss out on a second chance…miss out on a man who loves you just as much, if not more, than he did\". Cassie gave a small smile, her heart squeezing at the thought of both men, who loved her so much, and who she loved equally, albeit in different ways. \"I know, and it's,\" she bit her lip, unsure of how to voice her concerns, if she even should. \"It's not that\". Abigail's brow furrowed in confusion. \"If you're not having second thoughts about marrying Sam, then what is it? I've not seen you this…anxious, since he left for his humanitarian mission\". Cassie glanced around, knowing full-well (due to her intuition), the house was vacant for the time being. Yet, she needed the visual reassurance that her and Abigail were indeed, alone. \"Abigail, it's…it's been a long…time\". She didn't know how else to say it…to voice the fears, the insecurities that had plagued her mind the last few weeks. \"And it's okay to let your heart trust again, Cassie. It's okay to risk being loved again. Jake wouldn't want you scared of what the future may, or may not, bring\". A rueful smile tugged at the corner of her Cassie's mouth. Abigail just didn't get it. And she didn't know what to do. Didn't know how to verbalize her most intimate fears. She shook her head, taking a deep breath. She had no one to talk to about this….except Abigail. Despite their difference in age, as well as their personalities, Abigail did have a good heart, and from time to time had good advice to give, especially when it came to serious matters of the heart. When it came down to it, Cassie knew she'd be there for her. She fingered the towel absentmindedly, and her voice was almost a whisper when she spoke again. \"That's not it, either\". \"Then what is it, Cassie?\" Abigail peered at her cousin, who refused to look at her, her eyes darting nervously about the room. What in the world was she talking about? If Cassie was convinced she loved Sam with all her heart, and vice versa, and both were anxious to start their life together, then what was she worried about? Ohhhh….. The sudden epiphany swept over her in a crushing wave, and her heart broke for her cousin, whom Abigail always considered to be so brave, strong, so sure of herself. \"Oh Cassie,\" Abigail sighed, removing the towel from Cassie's trembling grip and tossing it to the side. She grasped her hands, sandwiching them between her own. \"Don't you know he loves you? And it's probably been a long time for him, too\". Not that she really believed the latter part. An eligible bachelor such as Sam, she was quite sure he hadn't been off that market very long prior to his relocation to the sleepy town of Middleton. Cassie nodded imperceptibly, too self-conscious and embarrassed to provide voice to her fears. It had been a long time. Six years, seven months, and 23 days to be exact. Not that she was keeping track, really. It just so happened her and Jakes's last intimate moments together had occurred the morning he'd been cruelly ripped away from her, leaving her to figure out how to put the pieces of her life back together, to finish raising a daughter who so desperately needed her father. Her eyes were watery, her voice trembling with emotion. \"Abigail you don't understand. I haven't…it's been…since Jake\". If Abigail was surprised, she took great pride in that she didn't show it. She had always known her cousin to be far more reserved in that area than herself, and honestly, she'd never really given it a lot of thought as to the status of her cousin's intimate life…or lack thereof, in the years following Jake's death. She felt a stab of pain in her own heart; if only she could be more like Cassie…if only she hadn't given herself over so cheaply to men who cared for nothing more than a one-night stand. She'd brushed these encounters off in a pathetic attempt to convince herself she wasn't hurt by them, wasn't longing for more. But as the years dragged on and the lines began to form in her heart and on her face, Abigail found herself wishing more and more that she had what Cassie had had with Jake, and now Sam: a real, deep, meaningful relationship, built on mutual understanding and a commitment to each other. She was tired of being alone. Tired of being used and discarded like yesterday's sales paper. But now was not the time to dwell on her own mistakes. Her cousin was uncharacteristically reaching out to her, and it was her responsibility to be there for her. She was family. Scratch that: she was more than a family…she was really her sister in heart. \"What if….what if I'm not good…what if I'm not enough?\" she whispered while the voices of anxiety and self-doubt screamed out from within. Abigail tightened her grip on Cassie's hands. \"Cassie, you ARE good enough. For anyone. Especially Sam\". She hooked a finger underneath her chin and gently lifted her face so she was forced to look Abigail in the eyes. \"It will be beautiful, and wonderful, and perfect because it will come from the heart, and because it will be between the two of you. And that's all that matters\". Despite her best attempts, her eyes filled with tears at Abigail's tender sentiments. \"Abigail, what happens if he decides…I'm not what he wants after all? What am I supposed to do, then? I can't…lose him, too\". \"No man worth his salt would do that to you, and I don't think Sam Radford fought to win your heart just to throw it away. Cassie. He loves you. He chose you . Don't cut yourself short\". Abigail went to say more, but stopped when both of them felt the familiar sensation of another person's presence….. \"Something certainly smells delicious in here!\" Sam announced as he entered the room, totally unaware of the intimate conversation taking place. He was starving, having skipped lunch due to a meeting that ran late and a backlog of patients to see. Her soup made his stomach grumble with anticipation! \"Is Cassie making her famous veg-\". He stopped short the moment he sensed something was clearly off, noting, with an element of concern, Cassie's suspiciously moist eyes, and the hesitant way she held herself. \"Everything ok?\" To Cassie's relief, Abigail was quick on her feet. \"Of course. Cassie and I were just discussing the flowers for the wedding, right Cass?\". He eyed them curiously as Cassie did not acknowledge his presence, but instead nodded in response to Abigail's question and turned her attention back to the soup that now bubbled in its pot. \"Oh. I thought we'd already decided on that\". \"You did\". Abigail hesitated briefly, then rushed on, \"I just felt that perhaps, they needed a little more…pop of color. I've got some leftover daises from Martha's Civic Club luncheon. I thought they'd be a great addition\". Sam jerked his head in Cassie's direction, covering the short distance between them. \"I think whatever Cassie chooses will be perfect. You know I don't know much about flowers, except roses are red\". Abigail rolled her eyes. \"Roses come in more colors than just red, Sam\". He kept his eyes on Cassie, who cast a quick glance and a timid smile in his direction. \"I'm sure they do, Abigail\". He stepped closer to Cassie. Ah yes, he noticed the telltale signs of tear marks on her face. Something had upset her, and it didn't have anything to do with the flowers. He gently touched her elbow, his gesture causing Cassie to look up at him. Again, her smile didn't reach her eyes. \"You okay?\" She nodded, gesturing towards the soup. \"Yeah. Um, the soup will be ready in just a few minutes. I'll spoon you up a bowl\". George entered the room at that time, and Cassie blew out a breath of relief at the interruption. \"Hey Sam, just the man I need to see! You mind helping me move some boxes in the garage. My back's been giving me a lot of attitude with all this rain. Of course,\" he gestured towards Cassie, \"I'll need some more of that eucalyptus ointment you made the other day. Whenever you get some time\". Cassie nodded. \"Certainly, George\". She turned the burner to the lowest setting, resting the handle of the spoon on the edge of the pot. \"I'll have some for you whenever you get finished downstairs\". \"Thanks Cassie,\" he grinned, then set off for the garage, a muddled Sam following close behind. Something was certainly off, and ever the quintessential physician, it was his job to figure what was wrong and make it right. : END CHAPTER ONE::[Chapter 2] I've been away from my writing desk since the last week in August: Attended Dragon Con in Atlanta for six days, was home for four days, then left for Europe for work and personal travel.

AU. Set pre-movies. Serious, well-read Sam Radford is finishing up medical school and thinking about the future. Grabbing a coffee between sessions in the library, Sam unexpectedly runs into Cassandra Nightingale. He has never met a woman like her before, and they are about to turn each other's worlds upside down. I know I should be finishing my other Good Witch story (and I will!) but the idea for this one just wouldn't leave me alone. Hope you like it and please leave a review :) Obviously I don't own the characters, but any mistakes are all mine! Chapter 1: Strangers Sam Radford couldn't remember the last time he had slept for more than a handful of hours at a time. Ever since he had come back to medical after Christmas break in his home state of Montana, Sam had been working around the clock. If he wasn't at the hospital shadowing the doctors and surgeons, he was in the apartment he shared with three other students studying for his exams. His schedule didn't allow for much of a social life, so aside from his roommates, the baristas at the local coffee shop and the pizza delivery guy, Sam rarely met any new people. He didn't even want to think about how long it had been since he had last gone on a date. There had been a girl back home he had been quite interested in, and they had shared a kiss under the mistletoe when he had been in Montana at Christmastime but he didn't think he could juggle a long distance romance at this point. He had been awake until four am, highlighting his already meticulous notes. He had worked hard throughout school and college, and he was determined not to fail now that he was so close to finally becoming a doctor. He had finally given in to the need for sleep and now, just before nine o'clock, he felt refreshed if not well-rested. Sam knew he needed a hot shower and a gallon of coffee before he could even face looking at another medical text book. He took care of the former first, relishing the fact that the apartment was empty and there was no one banging on the bathroom door telling him not to use all the hot water. The steamy shower helped his muscles, tense from being bent over his desk for hours at a time, relax a little and he felt better for slipping on a clean dark red t-shirt and jeans. The amount of clothes in his closet was decreasing and he knew that before too long he would have to take some time out of his busy schedule to do some laundry. Picking up his wallet and cell phone, Sam headed out into the early spring morning. There was still a bit of a chill in the air, but he didn't bother with a jacket. Hopefully the fresh breeze would help to clear his head some more. Perhaps, if it stayed dry, he might take his books outside later in the afternoon. He always frequented the same coffee shop, it was smaller and friendlier than the chain shops that were dotted around campus. Those shops might have been cheaper and the service a little faster, but Sam liked forming a rapport with the baristas. It was probably his small town upbringing. Sam pushed open the door and a little bell tinkled; something else that he liked about the place. It reminded him of the high street shops back home. The café was about half full, tables occupied by people of a range of ages. He spotted some students he recognised but whose names he didn't know. There were young moms with babies, older couples sitting opposite each other and, at table in the far corner of the room where she wouldn't be disturbed, was the most beautiful woman Sam Radford had ever seen in his entire twenty five years of living. She seemed to notice him at the same moment, looking up and across at him with the eyes that were both shy and confident at the same time. Sam was enthralled; so much so that he had barely noticed that the line at the counter was moving. He didn't want to break eye contact with her, but it wasn't exactly polite to stare at a woman he had never met before, in public. He was also pretty sure it was evident to her exactly what he was thinking. He managed to get through ordering his coffee, paying for it and collecting it in his normal fashion but he couldn't deny that his heart felt like it was beating twice as fast as normal. Even though he was looking at the barista, the same guy who served him most days for the past two years, in his mind all Sam could see was the gorgeous raven haired beauty at the back table. He wanted to approach the table and try to start up a conversation with her, but she might be waiting for her boyfriend and he wasn't sure he could stand to see her with another guy. He knew he was being ridiculous; he didn't know a thing about her. For all he knew she could be an awful, hateful person but he couldn't believe that. On his way out of the coffee shop, his large takeaway cup gripped firmly in one hand, Sam couldn't resist one more glance back at her. He hoped she'd be there tomorrow, too. By then he might have summoned the courage to say hello to her. He couldn't bear the idea that he might never see her again. Cassandra Nightingale thought she was going to like this area of Baltimore. The people she had met were friendly and she already knew she was going to love her course. After backpacking through China and Vietnam, Cassie was looking forward to being back in the states for a while. She was grateful too, that Johns Hopkins was letting her study with their anthropology department for a semester. She hoped to learn a lot, and that she would be able to bring some of her own unique travel experiences into the mix. As much as she liked being alone and having time to immerse herself in her thoughts, Cassie was starting to feel lonely. Her first class wasn't until later that afternoon and she hadn't met any of her fellow students yet. If she was honest, she was missing her friend and travel partner John Dover. When they had parted, John had been vague about where he was headed next but he had been certain that he wasn't ready to return home with Cassie. Although Cassie loved travelling, especially backpacking through different countries and cultures, she was more than ready to be back on familiar territory. Nowhere in particular was home to Cassie, but she felt a certain relationship between herself and America. It was where her parents had been born after all, and perhaps losing them at such a young age had made her bond with the country stronger. Cassie hadn't been in town long, but she had found time to explore the town. She was happy to see that there plenty of small, independent stores; she had even found a new age shop that had enable her to stock up on candles, incense and herbs. Money was a little short at the moment, so Cassie hoped that she might be able to get a part time job in the little shop or as a barista in one of the cafes. She had fallen in love with a cute little coffee shop on the edge of a small park. It was in a generally student-occupied area of the town, but the patrons were an interesting mix of ages and backgrounds. Cassie had settled in to a table near the back of the room where she was away from the noise and chatter of other people's conversations and hiss of the milk steamer. Despite it being a coffee shop, Cassie had ordered an organic blend of tea and a lemon and poppy seed muffin. She knew that a lot of people relied on coffee to wake them up in the morning and keep them going all day, but Cassie had always preferred tea – especially when she got the chance to brew some herself. The coffee shop made a lovely loose leaf peppermint tea though, so she was sure she would be returning. Although she'd bought a stack of books and a notepad with her, Cassie had to admit that she was really doing more people-watching and soaking up the atmosphere than actual studying. She was pouring herself another cup of tea from the china teapot when she felt compelled to look up; she could all but feel a pair of eyes boring into her. She raised her head, her long raven hair spilling back over her shoulders. The tea cup shook once in her hand before she steadied herself. Cassie was no stranger to feelings, in fact she felt and knew more than most people ever could. Just one look at this young man had her reeling though, but she couldn't understand why. Yes, he was attractive. He was tall and broad through the shoulders, his skin still showing the glow of a summer tan even though it was early spring and his golden brown hair stood up at all angles as if he had towelled it dry and then abandoned it. They made eye contact and their gazes locked, neither of them wanting to be the first to look away. Cassie had never felt anything as intense as that moment between them. She was suddenly aware that she was holding her breath; her entire body frozen in the chair. As quickly as it had started, it was over. Before Cassie had her breathing back under control, he was gone and the coffee shop door has swished shut behind him, sending the bell tinkling again. Cassie sighed and set her tea cup down on its saucer. Her hands were still a little unsteady as she wondered whether their paths would ever cross again. She had a funny feeling, like she did from time to time, that she and the mystery stranger would not remain strangers for very long.[Chapter 2] I Don't Know What to Do About You Thanks for the reviews on the first chapter. This has been really fun to write so far, really enjoying writing the two of them as young adults! I hope you enjoy this chapter too :) Chapter 2: Shook Sam was shaken for the rest of the day. He almost didn't need the cup of coffee, the moment with the mystery woman had given him a jolt that caffeine could never compete with. Although he spent most of the rest of the day poring over his books and his notes, Sam kept seeing her face in his head. He was sure his imagination must be taking over because no one person could possibly be as beautiful as the picture he had in his mind. Meghan, the girl he had been trying and failing to date back home in Montana, was beautiful too but looking at her had never moved him quite like today. He wished he knew her name, he was sure it must be something exotic to go with her beauty and grace. Around five o'clock, Sam sat back in his chair at the library. It was the same spot he always used, being a creature of habit. He would be pissed on the days when he came to the library to find another student sitting at his favourite desk. He stretched out his cramped neck and shoulders, and looked out of the window. It was starting to get dusky outside and his stomach gave a little growl, alerting him to the fact that it was also getting close to dinnertime. He thought about stopping for pizza on his way home, taking some back in case his roommates were around. They all kept such manic schedules that Sam had long since given up trying to keep track. Sam packed up his books, notepads and pens, and shoved them unceremoniously into his backpack. He winced under the weight despite his muscular back and shoulders. The pizza place that he and his roommates often visited was in the opposite direction to his apartment, so Sam decided on the curry house two blocks away instead. The scent of spices wafted to him as he approached, causing his stomach to growl again. He studied the menu on the wall outside, debating how much food to get versus how much cash was currently in his wallet. Still mulling over whether to get bhajis or samosas, Sam opened the door just as someone was coming out. They collided. The paper bag of takeout food that she carried crashed to ground as she tried to steady herself. \"Oh my gosh, I am so sorry!\" Sam bent to retrieve the torn paper bag. He stood up, trying to place the bag into her outstretched arms when he realised that he recognised her; it was the woman from the coffee shop. His face reddened, this was not how he had envisioned running into her again. He had not meant to be so literal about it. \"It's okay,\" She replied, tightening her grip on the bag. \"I wasn't looking where I was going.\" Her voice was almost musical, and Sam realised that he had been listening but hadn't made any reply. He picked up a stray plastic pot of mango chutney and popped it in the top of the bag. \"Looks like you're having quite the feast.\" It was her turn to blush now. \"I'm new in town, and I just wanted to try as many different dishes as I could. I just love Indian food.\" \"Clearly,\" Sam grinned, relaxing a little even though his heart was still beating like a jackhammer in his chest. \"Obviously I do too, or I wouldn't be here.\" She looked at him, meeting his eyes and making him feel like she was staring at his very soul. \"I've really bought too much, you could share it with me if you like.\" Sam stared at her for a moment, needing to make sure she had really said that and he wasn't just fantasising. \"Um, okay, sure.\" It was hardly the smooth reply he had been hoping he'd come up with but his brain was definitely not firing on all cylinders right now. \"I don't even know your name.\" She shifted the bag of food so she was holding it in one arm and offered him her hand. \"I'm Cassandra Nightingale, but everyone calls me Cassie.\" He shook her hand. It was cool, smooth and small in his. \"Sam. Sam Radford.\" He said as if on autopilot. He was busy thinking about how much the name suited her. \"You don't sound like you're from around here.\" \"I'm not. I grew up in Montana, I'm just here for school.\" \"Johns Hopkins?\" He nodded. \"What about you? Where are you from, Cassie?\" He liked the way her name felt on his lips. \"All over the place,\" She admitted. \"My parents travelled a lot, and I've never really gotten used to staying in one place.\" \"You're not at college here then?\" \"Sort of,\" She laughed. \"Just for a semester, with the anthropology department.\" Even though they barely knew each other, Sam felt bitter disappointment in his gut. Just one semester and she'd be long gone while he was beginning his medical career for real. \"What are you studying?\" She asked. They were walking now, Sam having relieved her of the takeout bag. \"I'm in my final year of medical school.\" Cassie let out a low whistle. \"Wow. Can I call you Sam or would you prefer Dr. Radford?\" Sam chuckled. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I've still got to pass my boards.\" They'd walked to the park, near where the coffee shop was situated. It seemed appropriate. They sat opposite each other at a picnic table and unloaded the food. Cassie took out the disposable cutlery and napkins she had tucked into her purse. She'd had a feeling that they might come in handy. Sam saw them and laughed, but didn't comment. He was happy just to look at her, watching as she sampled the dishes and sides, a look of pure delight on her face. Sam's imagination hadn't deceived him, she really was as striking as he remembered. Her long dark hair was tied up in a ponytail now and somehow it made her look younger, drawing attention to her cheekbones and her full lips. He'd never been so struck by someone; so blown away that it was an effort to remember to breathe. Somewhere deep down, he knew that no other woman was ever going to compare.

Serious, well-read Sam Radford is"},{"Movie":"Where the Wild Things Are","Title":"Going Wild","Author":"A Piece for Some Peace","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5799893","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Max? Max?\" A knock rapped on his wooden door, but he gave no response. Though it may have been rude, Max could not be entirely blamed for ignoring his sister. At eighteen, Max was coming into his own. Unlike many of his fellow friends, he was going to graduate, even if it only meant skimming by with mostly C's and B's. His successes and failures were to be credited (or blamed) for his latest trend. Halfway through his high school sophomore year, he had taken up smoking pot. \"Max! Max! Wake up, it's dinner time.\" Called his sister Claire. Again, he chose not to respond. Currently, Max resided in a nest of dirtied clothes and school papers. Illustrations from previous hours of meditation lined his walls. From the closet adjacent to him toys and childhood mementoes peeped down him. Faded octopus and teddy bear faces frowned in a way of disapproval. As time wears, all children grow away from their tools that help them learn. Finally, the door to Max's room burst open. Claire had forgone politeness to retrieve her brother. \"Max it's time for Thanks-.\" Halfway through her semi-lecture, Claire paused, smelling the fragrant smoke. Saying nothing, she looked to Max's illustrations as away to escape tears. She wanted to protect her brother, but she knew speaking to him would only push him away. \"Dinner's ready Max, please come down now.\" She said in a soft, ragged voice. Carefully, she backed out of the dark room and into the brightly lit hall, and closed the door gingerly. Max stayed where he lay, not wishing to move. He saw the disapproval in Claire's eyes, and he feared what she might say to mother. Not that mother would do anything, but Max did not like to discuss his affairs. Pot was just his way to think clearly and sort things out, his key to meditation. It was not a problem, nothing serious. Through the smoke and the mind-numbing waves, Max found that he was able to avoid those pesky daydreams, and just lay still for a while. Ever since he was young, Max had stupid visions that kept him from being himself, from being normal. All of those fantasies he held, those other worlds, they stopped him from being in this world, and Max was fed up. Now he had many friends, people liked him, and most of all; he was not burdened by his dreams anymore. So there he stayed, half-asleep in a protective cocoon of thoughts, clothes, and a grounded mysticism. Downstairs, Claire and his mother, Connie, sat around their dinky table, a petite banquet set up to celebrate being thankful. Off in the kitchen, Mark, Connie's husband, cut up the turkey. They were not so thankful this night. Claire choked back tears as her mother poured wine for each of them, even a little for Max if he would just come down. \"Do you know how long it has been since Max has written anything?\" Asked Connie. Claire shook her head, recalling Max's excitement for storytelling. \"I'm sure he has written something.\" Offered Claire. \"No, I am sure he has, but he has not read anything to me.\" Connie said, feeling less than hungry as she scooped some mashed potatoes from her serving dish. Placing some turkey on everyone's plate, Mark took a seat. \"He's just going through a hard time.\" Mark suggested, not very close to Max. Instantly discrediting his words because of this, Claire turned to her mother. \"Is… Max okay?\" She asked. \"Oh, he is fine I suppose. He is not sick, and he is doing okay in school, but he just is not the same.\" His mother said, frustrated. \"I mean… is he doing anything?\" Asked Claire once more, hoping that her mother would catch what she was hinting at without having to spell it out. \"That.\" Answered Connie, finally catching on. \"He reasoned to me it was nothing to be worried over, and I believe him. I only worry it is slowing him down.\" Mark turned over his food, not wishing to be involved in this. Having smoked pot as a teen himself, he saw it as just something done occasionally with friends at parties. According to Mark, it was nothing to worry over. \"What do you mean? Are his grades slipping?\" Claire asked, growing concerned. \"No, no, not at all, Max is just… not as in the clouds as much as he used to be.\" Explained Connie, seeing a look of confusion spread over her daughter's face, she thought to clarify, but was interrupted by Mark. \"It is for the best. Think about it, Max does not get in trouble like he used to. That boy has always needed to be brought back to Earth.\" He said with an unintentional insensitivity. A flame rose in Connie and Claire regardless, eager to defend their boy. Connie calmed down before she said something too rash. \"That may be, but he just is not the boy filled with wishes and questions anymore.\" Retorted Connie, sipping her wine. It was the end of the discussion. Small talk was made over weather and Claire's time off at college. The room felt so empty for a place so tight. Perhaps it was that neither Claire nor Connie could not help but imagine the simple wooden stools being jumped on by Max. Even though he was a teenager, they still expected half of him to run down in his wolf suit and knock things around while exploring and adventuring. A stomping came from the stairs. The two women wanted more than anything to see Max declaring he was king again, and wished sending Max to his room could still be considered a punishment. \"Max, you're here.\" Greeted Connie warmly. Lines like that of tree rings mapped out in red waves the contours of where his face had met creases. Like a billowing fire, his hair stuck almost straight up in patches from the tossing and turning he had done. Through bloodshot eyes he looked at the forlorn faces at the table and felt a little resentment. \"Hey.\" He greeted, not wishing to say too much. Right now, he cursed his hunger. Taking a seat at the table, the equilibrium brought on by false happiness was lost, and silence reigned. The wall clock billowed loudly with its ticks, causing a great sense of discomfort and agitation. \"So how has school been?\" Asked Claire, using a bit of enthusiasm she hoped would bolster the overall spirit of the room. The fork of Max dug into his porcelain plate, causing an unsightly screeching. The family dog rose and left the room, even the promise of food was outweighed by the din of the silverware. Staring down at his food, Max's mind swirled. School, school, how had school been? \"Good.\" Max offered, unwilling to say much else. His lack of a meaningful response had the desired effect of stumping Claire, if only for a little while. The broken family returned to taking small bites of food. \"Have you written anything lately?\" Claire asked, pressing on. Max slowed his eating slightly. This was not a matter he was entirely proud of. \"No, no I haven't.\" He answered, feeling a bit defeated. At this point, no one was eating. Eating utensils stayed midair, swirling to fake purpose. \"What about school?\" Connie asked, joining in the conversation. \"There haven't been any creative writing prompts since I was in the fourth grade.\" Scoffed Max. His bitter words only served to show that he had no solid excuse. \"Max, we're worried about you. Is there anything wrong?\" Asked his mother. Taking it as a criticism, Max laid down his fork with enough force to cause a stir. \"What is this about? I am fine.\" He asserted quite angrily. \"No you are not.\" Mark broke in. \"Your mother is very worried about you.\" Mark played a dangerous game, Max hardly saw him as a father, and his words only served to push Max closer to the edge. \"Ugh, shut up Mark. Like I said, I am okay. You don't understand.\" Max shouted in a mixed tone. Slightly on the offensive and partially on the defensive, Max felt so outnumbered by the inquiring stares of his family. \"From what I have seen, you aren't yourself at all.\" Claire said, trying to sound reasonable, but coming off accusing. \"Ugh, fuck you!\" Grinding his teeth, Max stood up. \"Fuck all of this.\" His chair slid behind him against the unruly oak floors and knocked over, hitting the wall. A couple pictures feel from where they hung, causing the frames to break and glass to crack in a startling volume. The slam of the chair frightened the dog enough for him to bark in warning. Taken aback, the small family stared on in a fearful stupor, unaware of Max's next move. Seeing the looks marring his favorite people, Max felt a wave of self-loathing and pity all at once. Backing away, he ran out the door for the second time in his life. Gathering her wits, Connie rose. \"Max!\" She yelled. \"Max! Max, come back!\" Exiting the home, Max had slammed the door a couple inches from his mother's face. Sinking to the ground, his mother sobbed. All over again, she had lost her boy. Claire dialed the cops as Mark came out to comfort his wife in the living room. Nothing could ease the nerves they felt, each fearing Max would never return to them. Panting, Max ran further and further away from the prison he had once called home. His lungs begged for mercy, but Max had none to show. Before he would stop Max wanted to be far away from his cage. Rounding fences and yards, Max found shelter in a familiar wooded area. No one would find him here. No one would look for all he knew. It was such a cold night, they would expect him back soon enough, not that he was coming. Feeling spiteful, Max ventured further into the woods.[Chapter 2] In a wooded area, Max grabbed his lengthy hair in frustration. He screamed knowing no one would hear him. Anything within arm reach was annihilated or tossed into the brush. The strenuous activity made all of his grievances seem to explode and collide. Nothing mattered, all Max had to do was destroy and his mind could relax for once tonight. At the same time, he was not relaxed in the least. He needed to move around. Sitting here would only make his brain explode. As a way to let his tiring muscles rest and run away from his creeping thoughts, Max started to push forward in the woods. Before him stray branches would brush roughly across his face, leaving tiny scratches and causing his eyes to water. \"Fuck…\" He hissed, but recoiled at the sound of his voice. Max felt slightly stupid and self aware by talking to himself. Coming back into a conscious thought process, Max found he was at a familiar body of water. In the cloudy night it did not shimmer as brightly as it had previously in his last visit. Rocking back and fourth at the banks was his old boat, with some wear and tear of course, but nearly the same. His name was still scratched on the side crudely, and the mast carried a damaged sail. Knowing what to do, Max climbed aboard, and set sail. Very smoothly he slid across the water at first, but as he went along he started hitting some resistance. Max held tightly to the rope at the mast and peered over the shoddy portside to see what was fighting him in the water. Astonishingly enough, he revealed there to be guitars and drums floating past. Hitting his ship, drums would let out loud beats and guitars would wail. It was like going through a rock ballad. Overhead, storm clouds assembled in their traditional patterns, and Max braced himself for what he knew to be ahead. Wind rushed, blowing Max's hair back. Looking toward the oncoming weather, Max squinted as the boat hopped along the increasingly high waves. The rocking of the boat and the intensity of the waves sent the musical instruments at a new grotesque type of wail with each smash of wood and musical tool. Soaring upon one wave, the boat rode alongside its curls like a surfboard at a ninety-degree angle. \"I'm going to die.\" He thought frantically. \"God damn it… I am really going to die.\" Impressively the boat rode up the wave as Max clung gallantly for life onto the mast. Having made it over one wave, hit boat only met another, and another after that. It was like some horrific rollercoaster. Under different circumstances, this would be something Max would greatly enjoy. With each new crest Max had to bat away some guitar, triangle, or violin like a fish flopping out of water. \"Ugh...\" Grunted Max. He moved to the wheel of the boat in order to gain some control. If he remembered correctly, this whole thing would be ending soon. Fate had something else in store for him however, as only more waves came to him as if only out of spite. At one point on this ever increasingly terrifying travel the boat fell beneath the crest of a wave and was overtaken. Max's outcry was smothered by an onslaught of seawater. Choking on the waves, Max slipped on the wet deck and hit his head on a bench. The cool air and violent storm were not enough to keep him awake at this point. It seemed the boat would have to take control now. The period of his sleep was just as tumultuous and trivial as his waking Odyssey, for his dreams only carried him to darkness and worries. Instead of relieving him of the fearsome storm of the outside world, he was stuck in the entrapments of his pessimistic mind. In his mind he was home again, unable to find his drugs, unable to find his family, and all that he could find was his pathetic wolf suit, worn from countless trials. Never before had he been so happy to wake. Upon his waking, he was much displeased to find no relief from the storm. The waves were still rocketing him to terrifying highs and lows. At this point, a milky fog had set around him, so not only was he being turned around and around on this sickening sea, he was completely blind to where the storm was taking him. Max wondered if his dreams were so awful after all in comparison to this hell he found himself in. This trip had become some kind of purgatory, and here Max was, in the middle of nowhere. How was he to know if a day had passed or not? The sun and moon could not pierce the thick clouds ensnaring Max. With no outlet for his mind to wander, no book, no computer, no TV, no pot, Max was stuck within the confines of his mind, a place he rarely wished to explore. Guilt and anger among other emotions he had suppressed for so long had wormed their way to the surface in the nothingness. Why did everyone ask so much of him? It was unfair, he was only a kid, and nobody even bothered Mark. Max started to weep, and eventually started to sob, no longer wishing to deal with these feelings. \"Damn it, damn it, damn it!\" He yelled, slamming his fist against the mast. Unfortunately for Max, he had drastically underestimated his strength and overestimated that of the boat. Under the force of his fist, the mast cracked and fell, and the sail no longer caught wind. Beneath the boat Max heard the scraping of instruments. A new fear overtook him, if the boat could not take his beatings, how would it do for the remainder of the storm? He could not run about in fear, but was trapped at his seat once again with his thoughts. Frantically, Max gathered up the rope from the mast and sail and attempted to tie the ends of wood together, only to see them fall to the floor of the vessel all over again. Sliding down beside it, Max clutched his head in absolute dread. He knew it, and he had predicted the future. Max knew it was his fate to die out here in the nothingness. Salty tears mixed in with the wet hull of the boat. Max curled into a ball and listened to the instruments rap along the bottom of the vessel, their noises lulling him to sleep. Unlike before however, Max did not allow such an escape to envelop him. Quietly like a mouse he remained awake, listening to the crash of waves and soaring beats. For hours, days, and weeks this must have gone on until finally after an eternity, there was a scrape of the boat hitting the rocky shore. As he had done so eagerly before, Max hopped out of the small vessel into the water, and pulled his boat to safety. Carefully Max tied his boat down out of the way of the surf, and began a trek along the shore. Treasured memories and terrifying memories alike came to him. He was at his island, where he once reigned, the Island of the Wild Things. Here Max had ruled, only to fall disgracefully out of power. Would they allow him to rule again? It was night, just like his first day of arrival. Similar to home, the stars were shielded by dull mauve clouds, but he could see the eerie glow of the moon struggling through. Behind him Max saw the fog retreat out to foreign seas. \"Hello?\" Bellowed Max, his voice shot through the dark, up the rock walls and down the beach. No reply. Nine years had a lot of give, and although he remembered things quite vividly, Max had some trouble recalling where he had made a home with his Wild Things. So, in the only way he knew how, Max set out down the beach. Some things struck him as familiar, but that was probably only due to the fact that this place had so few recognizably different features. One rock looked like another, one hill had no other traits than the next. Reaching the crest of a sizable hill, Max prepared to call out again, but was interrupted by the sight that lay before him. \"Hel-\" He began, but stopped, seeing a singed earth bellow him. His mouth lay agape as he looked upon once golden knee high grass singed brown and black with a few sparing embers glowing in the night. Fearful for his wild friends, Max ran down the hill, not sure what he would find. His mad dash was short lived however, as the hill's incline had run out and Max was anything but an athlete. At a walking pace he was able to truly take in the carnage. The beauty of the land had been lost to perverse fires, in all likelihood started by Carol. Max frowned, wondering what had sent Carol over the edge on this occasion. Beneath his feet, Max kicked some dirt around to pat down the coals. Oddly enough, some of the embers were glowing green and blue. It was such a strange sight, and something he had yet to see from Carol, and suddenly had made Max quite fearful. Who could have done this to his friends, to their home? Max took up running once more, and despite the heavy protest of his lungs kept running. \"Hello?\" Max called out, more frantically this time, his voice almost catching in his throat. He called again and again, building volume. \"Hello? Hello?\" He kept pace, and kept calling, eventually reaching something of a cliff. Unable to slow himself, Max felt himself creeping over the edge falling from the plateau to his doom on the rocks bellow. The loosely compacted dirt at the edge gave way to his heels speeding up his descent. A terrified scream found its way out Max's throat, just as a warm hand took hold of his ankle. Max fell forward, head hanging to look down at the rocky floor bellow. His whole body rocking back and forth, Max saw the completed fortress he had built so long ago, up in a purple blaze. \"Help!\" He stuttered out, swinging his arms. \"Shh…\" Was the response, quieting Max. Once completely quiet, the massive creature pulled Max entirely up into the safety of its arms. Wrapped in warmth, Max looked up. \"K.W.?\" He asked, confused. K.W. looked lovingly upon him, with a tinge of sadness as well. \"Oh Max.\" She said. \"Is that you? It has been so long. We really need you here now.\" \"What has happened?\" Asked Max, feeling like a little boy all over again with his childhood companion and protector here with him. \"So many things Max. Everything has changed. It is so good to have you back.\" K.W. tightly held Max to her chest in another embrace, squeezing him close to tears. Abruptly she stopped, growing grave. She looked down at Max in her arms and said quite seriously, \"Max, we can't stay here long, we're not safe you know.\" Max drew in a tight breath. A creeping fear took over him as to what had become of his favorite place.[Chapter 3] K.W. had taken Max, still small in comparison, in her arms. \"You need to be quiet, it isn't safe here.\" She whispered with all sincerity. The gravity of her words silenced Max. Feeling the cold of the night's air on his wet frame, Max held tightly to K.W.' s warm and soft body. His mind spun, wondering what had happened to the land of his fantasies. Through the burnt grass plains they went, to a charred forest. It was a place Max recalled to once be lush, though mostly leafless in the fall of his mind. The further along K.W. took Max the less he saw smoldering embers. Finally, at a certain point, K.W. lowered Max to the ground, littered with dead leaves and twigs. \"See that tree?\" She asked Max, pointing to a medium sized pine tree. He nodded. \"Go to the base, there is a hole we can slide down, to our home.\" Max examined K.W.' s features briefly, and then did as instructed. Pushing aside some of the decay, Max found the entrance K.W had spoken of. Despite his misgivings, Max did as was asked of him, and plummeted forward into a dark tunnel that was much deeper than anticipated. \"Whoa!\" He cried, falling into the black expanse. Behind him Max heard K.W. jump into the entrance with him, her fur and hide catching on roots poking out in the dark. With her passing sounds of loose dirt rolling could be heard along with the snapping of pesky branches. Falling and falling, it seemed like an eternity of it, and Max found himself getting queasy from either the constant motion or the lack of light he so longed for, he could not quite tell. Before he could ask, K.W. gave a small, reserved howl of sorts. \"We're here Max.\" She said, her voice hushed. Together the paired fell into an open space, lit by a sizable fire in one corner in a makeshift fireplace. The room was warm, like a bed after being slept in all night. In the center of the shelter support beams from tree trunks supported the compacted dirt ceiling. Around the room were special rocks and objects assembled by K.W. or some other wild thing, their meanings secret to all but their owners. Richard the raccoon scuttled over Max's feet and up an adjacent tunnel, off to important matters. By the fire, there were some logs arranged for seating, each varying in size for their respective wild thing, but all large nonetheless. On two of the logs sat Alexander, his eyes entranced by the flame, and Bernard the bull, who was looking towards Max and K.W. silently. Max felt nervous in such a small space, especially under the scrutinizing gaze of Bernard. Horrifying still, Max noticed Alexander was missing an arm and Bernard had no eyes. Much effort was required in order for Max not to stare. \"Hi.\" Max greeted pathetically, waving his arm only to feel dorkier. Bernard, just as Max had remembered, remained characteristically silent. Sitting on his log, Alexander looked over to Max with a twinge of disdain, and looked back to the fire. After a short pause and a disgruntled cough from K.W., Alexander finally gave a brief hello. \"Hey… King…\" He muttered, with an emphasis on king for an effect of sarcasm. K.W., next to Max, frowned. Regardless of all Max had gone through over the years to fit in and feel welcomed, Max had yet to feel so exposed as he did then. Alexander's general nihility and apathy unsettled Max. This was the perfect opportunity for Alexander to get his word he always craved in, and yet he was silent. K.W. put her paws on her hips and let out a low growl. \"That is way rude Alexander.\" She scolded, lowering her gaze. Alexander finally gave his full attention to K.W. Bernard looked on, or at least had his head lifted in their direction his emotions virtually illegible upon his gruff face. Max tugged on K.W.' s arm, very much like a little kid. \"It's fine. It's perfectly fine.\" He muttered lowly, feeling the judging eyes of Alexander upon him. Never before had Alexander carried this much power over Max, and a part of him was definitely enjoying such a change. Alexander turned to the fire dramatically dark, and then in an exaggerated motion turned back quickly, leveling a hoof Max's direction. \"It's his fault you know.\" Alexander accused, directing his words at K.W., who was glowering down at him in return. She stepped closer. \"You know that's not true, this is all of our fault really.\" Explained K.W. Alexander rolled his eyes, but delighted in seeing Max look on confusedly between them. \"Uh… what am I responsible for exactly?\" Asked Max, getting a bit defensive. K.W. angled herself towards him while Alexander gave a short and humorless laugh. This only served to provoke K.W. and irritate Max. \"Well?\" Asked Max, swinging his hands. \"Tell him K.W., tell him. Tell him why all of these fires even started in the first place. Tell him why the sun is gone and everything is turning to dust.\" Instructed Alexander with fury; replacing the joy he had ultimately felt. All of the pent up emotions he'd felt these years was finally finding a release, at Max's expense. Feeling affronted, Max put up the disguise of being angry, really feeling rather worried. K.W. gave a bit of a sigh and looked to Max. \"I think we should sit down.\" She said, worrying Max. K.W. took a seat by Bernard, and patted the space beside her, motioning for Max to come closer. All the while Alexander watched with a critical glare from his spot by the flame. Even Bernard waited eagerly for him to take a seat. In the back of his mind, Max wondered if there was time to get away, or at least something to take his mind off things, and return to the confines of his room. The thought of his enraged family yelling his ear off kept him in place, neither coming nor going. \"Sit Max.\" Instructed K.W. again. This time Max obeyed, and took up the space left beside K.W., who allowed him to nestle in at her side once more. In a very professional way, K.W. cleared her throat in preparation for a long story. Intercepting her long speech, Alexander interrupted with a bit of a laugh. \"Tell him about the fire!\" He chuckled. K.W. shot Alexander a glare for what felt to be the fiftieth time in such a short period. \"Shut up.\" She ordered, kicking Alexander at the shin. Recoiling and letting out a shout, Alexander was silenced. Waiting for him to finish, K.W. was allowed to carry on. \"After you left, everything was like, so perfect, you know? Carol was so sweet, and Bob and Terry hung around for the longest time without any problems. We even finished your fort, though we never got robots or anything fancy.\" Hearing this, Max smiled. Anxiously Alexander waited for K.W. to carry on. \"Things were great for awhile, but then Bob and Terry just went missing.\" \"Missing?\" Asked Max. K.W. nodded. \"Yeah, just like, gone,\" She said, snapping her fingers on poof. \"Just like that and they were gone. It totally destroyed me you know? My friends were just gone all of a sudden. It really sucked, and even though everyone helped me look, we could not find them. The only one not looking for them was Carol. It was like, well, it just had to be him. I knew he had done something. With my entire soul I knew Carol had done something.\" \"But why would Carol do that?\" Asked Max, wishing the best for his friend and bewildered at the thought of Carol doing such a thing. K.W. looked sadly down at Max and shrugged her shoulders quite sadly. \"I don't know, I just feel he had something to do with their leaving. Maybe he did not hurt them physically and all, but who knows, maybe it was something he said. They're sensitive you know.\" K.W. gazed into the fire and sighed and looked back towards Max. \"So all of this stuff is going on, I'm mad at Carol, he's mad at me, typical sort of thing, and then something new happens. Normally we just would make up and move on, but Carol never came back to me, never apologized or said anything at all.\" Listening intently, Max wondered where Carol was now, and what any of this had to do with him. K.W. proceeded on with her story. \"One day, out looking for Bob and Terry, I found something, something like, completely scary. It was your name Max; your name was burned in the woods on every tree I walked past. It was so freaky. The further I walked along the more of your name I saw, burned on tree after tree. All the leaves were singed off. It was totally weird. That's when I found Carol.\" K.W. paused, looking at Max, gauging his reaction. Seeing he was listening intently with keen interest, she carried on. \"Carol was bleeding all over, something cut into him. There is something evil going on Max, and it's destroying our home.\" \"What do you mean?\" Asked Max. \"I am not sure how to describe it, but something is changing things around here. Like, taking friends over, making them do bad things, and then hurting them.\" K.W. said, rubbing her arm to comfort herself. \"I don't know how this started, but I know it has to do with Carol and his anger. Max, we need your help, I know you can do something about this.\" \"I bet he could pretend he can.\" Muttered Alexander. K.W. promptly kicked him in the knee, silencing him effectively following a yelp. Shifting uncomfortably, Max avoided K.W.' s pleading eyes. \"I,\" he said, trailing off, looking for an appropriate way to decline, \"do not think I can do anything. Sorry.\" Shoulders slumping, K.W.' s eyes contorted into a dismayed shape. Her wide mouth fell into a hard-pressed frown. On the spot, Max felt like crap. Now, more than ever, he wanted to leave. Faced with disappointment from someone he had so looked up to was even less appealing than a shouted out lecture. Standing up, he brushed away the immense amount of mud on his jeans. \"I would help, but I have to go home. Sorry.\" He said, repeating his apologies. \"Let me guide you out.\" Offered K.W. Giving no time for a refusal, K.W. pushed away some of the wall, revealing a hidden passageway. \"A shortcut to the beach.\" Together they walked through the tunnel, Max feeling indignant with K.W. treating him like a child. As the burrowed exit widened and it became easier to see, K.W. offered Max her hand for support. A small part of Max wanted not only to take her large hand, but to also embrace her tightly. He was so afraid in actuality, or at least very uncomfortable with what had become of his world. A greater part of Max wished to come off as an adult; he wanted to be someone who was left alone. So, instead of taking her hand, he ignored her offer, playing it off as if he had not heard her. Following some time, hours it seemed, of walking the hidden path, Max and K.W. came upon a boulder. Seams of light filtered in through the cracks between the boulder and what was apparently the opening to the outside. Pushing the boulder lightly, the exit was opened with ease by K.W. Allowing Max to pass by; K.W. rolled the large stone back into place, concealing the opening. \"What happened?\" Asked Max, staring with confusion at his once pristine boat. All that remained was the charred skeleton of his watercraft and ashes that whipped up with the breeze of the beach. K.W. walked up beside him, keeping with her typical steady pace. Sickened by the burnt wreckage, her eyes widened in abject horror. \"Max, that force, it knows you're here. You need to get out of here.\" K.W. urged. \"How? Where? My boat is destroyed.\" Replied Max, discovering that hiding his fear was becoming more challenging. K.W. shook her head, rolling her eyes to the hazy violet sky for answers. When none came, she looked back to him. \"We really need your help. You're the king, can't you just stay and try?\" Pleaded K.W., bringing up the issue once more. Opening in closing his mouth, Max resembled a fish more than an arrogant teenager, fearful of the confines of his mind. Struggling with what to say, he felt so entirely stupid. \"I…\" he started, pausing to think of something, anything to say, \"I…\" Max would not finish his sentence however, because at that moment there was a resounding boom. Sand shot up into the air, splashing with a swishing noise into the ocean lapping on the shore. In the horizontal crater that had formed, a figure rose. Its fur, matted and torn, blew every which way in the soft gusts of air. Looking to its face, Max was so repulsed he could almost throw up. The face of the creature had tears running across it. Rotting flesh hung from gaping wounds, probably being the source of the malodor. In a moment of shock and terror, Max recognized his aggressor. \"Ira?\" Asked Max, his knees quivering.[Chapter 4] Ira, towering above Max, was far gone. This was no friendly beast in love. \"Ira?\" asked Max again, his voice shaking. With a low growl, Ira raised a large fist. Cowering, Max shielded himself in vain with his arms, knowing that he would be crushed. \"Ira, stop!\" ordered K.W. Ira slammed his fist to the earth with a gnashing of his teeth. Barely missing Max, Ira had destroyed the skeletal remains of Max's boat. Lowering his face to meet the face of Max, Ira's eyes bled tears. \"You can't leave Max.\" He said. \"Not until you save my Judith.\" K.W. came before Max, acting as a guard. Her arms spread wide; Max could barely see the defeated looking Ira. Sobs carried across Ira at this point, his entire figure shaking. With a wave of his mighty claw, Ira tossed K.W. aside. K.W. howled as she was sent digging into the sand, her arm absorbing the impact with a sickening sound. The path now, cleared, Ira approached Max. \"You can't just leave.\" He pleaded. \"You're the king, you can do something.\" \"What can I do? I'm just some kid. I don't have powers or anything like that.\" Max argued, feeling for his wild former friend. Knowing he was no match for someone of Ira's size, Max took calculated steps away from Ira. It was the end; Max prepared for his demise and regretted his choice to return to his long forgotten hide out. Ira raised a great and ragged claw, wishing it would allow Max to see the light, but not realizing how it would surely do away with the former boy-king. \"Stop!\" came a desperate cry. It was Alexander, with Bernard in tow. When Ira ignored him after a short pause, Alexander became frustrated, tired of the usual way of things. K.W., taking advantage of the quick distraction, took her place in front of Max once more, serving as a shield. \"Bernard, stop him.\" Bernard looked to Alexander silently, and then obeyed, running towards Ira with surprising speed for someone of his size. Having much more strength than Ira, Bernard made quick work of his deranged friend. Crashing to the ground, Ira let go of his aggressive stance. Seeing this, K.W. yielded and allowed Max a better view of Ira. The feeling was incredibly cold on the beach. The small patches of smoldering wood left from the boat did nothing to stifle the chilled air. No one said anything for a long while. The sky, cleared of its previous clouds, was a deep violet where stars wearily winked at them. Reflecting on the distant memories, it was K.W. who decided to speak. \"You're the king Max, you do have magic. Why else would you be here? There's something bigger than us at work here.\" \"Like what?\" asked Max, still full of doubt. K.W. shook her head. \"You don't understand. It's bigger than us Max, bigger than you… king.\" She said. Ira nodded. \"She's right, only you can find Judith and save this world.\" Their logic made very little sense to Max, someone who had for so long ached for grounded reality. Words such a destiny and fate had given way to things such as obligation and duty. Ruefully, Max looked to the husk of his once proud boat. \"If I help, will you make me a new boat?\" He asked of the group. Looking to one another sheepishly, it was clear none of them possessed the skill. \"We could… try?\" offered K.W. \"As if that would amount to anything.\" muttered Alexander, always a skeptic. \"That's not the spirit!\" scolded K.W. \"Well it's true, we could make a raft I guess.\" conceded Alexander. Regardless of the suggestion, it was apparent the group held strong doubts about their abilities. Max, seeing the unraveling situation, knew he was the only one who could lead at this point, it was frustrating. \"Come on, Ira, you're the best tunnel maker I've seen, and you, K.W., you're so smart, I'm sure you can do something about this. What about you Bernard? You're so strong, you could help get supplies. As for you Alexander, well, I mean, you could help.\" Max could not believe himself, how was he expected to head the group when he had no idea what he was even doing. Regardless, his words seemed to rouse some confidence. \"Alright,\" Max began, \"if we're going to fix this place, we'll need to do this as a group. Who are we missing?\" \"Judith,\" said Ira, lifting his heavy head. \"Carol and Douglas,\" added Alexander. \"Bob and Terry too,\" concluded K.W. Max nodded. Each of his long lost friends looked to him with baited breath, awaiting orders. \"Who should we look for first? Do we know where anyone is?\" asked Max, hoping to inspire some assistance. Ira was the first to make a suggestion. \"Judith, it has to be Judith.\" \"You don't even know where Judith is.\" Alexander said in misgiving. \"I do, she's in a place I can't get to. Only the king can.\" \"How?\" asked Max, stepping in before another fight broke out. Ira smiled, knowing he was one step closer to retrieving Judith.[Chapter 5] Max shivered, he was riding on Ira's back, going through a smoky forest with thin, wispy birch trees. Why he had come this far with them, Max was still in wonderment. The last thing he wanted was trouble, but when he saw how much he was relied upon by his friends, he felt a compelling obligation. So here he was, aiding his friends in the search for Judith when he could be with his human friends, kicking back and hanging out in a warm, if not a little messy, room. Playing video games and drinking what they could get their hands on was far less of a challenge than this. It was too much for him to dwell upon, so he kept those wishful thoughts away for the time being. Because there was no path set in place, Ira had taken the lead, his massive body snapping branches and setting aside a way for the others to follow. It was impossible to see anything further than five feet ahead of them. Though Max was comforted knowing K.W., Alexander, and Bernard were keeping pace behind he and Ira, he could only make out their silhouettes vaguely. The further behind they were, the less crisp their figures seemed. Turning back around, Max swallowed, trying not to allow the fear overtake him. \"My feet hurt.\" Max heard Alexander mutter somewhere behind him. \"How much farther?\" said Max asking Ira. Grumbling beneath him, Ira said something to the effect that he did not know. This seemed to please Alexander for the time being, who was quite wise in not upsetting Ira. The silence was ominous, neither bird nor beast made a noise on their journey. Wondering what kind of creature could overpower someone as powerful as Judith, Max was full of questions. At that moment, Max deeply wished he was back at home, in the arms of his mother and the care of his sister. Hell, it didn't even matter if Mark was there too. He knew that it was not time for him to leave though, for he was king, and his friends needed him. From behind him, Max heard Alexander cry out, then Bernard, then K.W., and finally Ira, who tumbled forward after having K.W. collide into him. \"Sorry.\" mumbled Bernard. \"What was that?\" called K.W. in disgust. There was a frantic feeling amongst the group. Their vision inhibited, panic set in with the unknown. \"Someone tripped me!\" cried Alexander, who had been the first to fall. A new fear set in. \"What?\" asked Ira. \"I was tripped I swear! Something grabbed my legs!\" Alexander cried. The group huddled closer, their eyes set intensely on the ground, looking for the hands or traps of the enemy. \"I don't see anything.\" Max said with finality. \"We shouldn't stay here too long though.\" \"What do you think it is?\" asked Alexander, his voice fraught with concern. Alexander cried out, but no one came to his aid, seeing that Bernard, strong and silent, had lifted him from the forest floor. \"You'll be safer up there.\" Said K.W. \"Alright, you heard the king, let's move forward.\" And so forward they pressed, each with heightened awareness of the surrounding area. Ira and Max still carried the lead, Ira knowing where Judith was being held. Either love or some other force allowed Ira the sense to find his wife in the gloomy area with no stars or moon. Behind them was K.W., and following her were Bernard and Alexander. \"I found her a while ago king,\" Ira said, his voice low, \"Judith was sick, and I couldn't help her. They had her, and I couldn't do anything.\" The pain in Ira's voice was evident, and so lost in his sorrow, he let out a howl. Echoing through the forest, it spun around them, growing more rueful and forlorn with each spin. Though the mood of their trip had hardly proved jovial, the group suddenly felt incredibly crestfallen. Ira's heartbreak was felt by each member of the group, and pausing, they were silent with sympathy, no one in the group ever having felt the kind of love Ira shared with Judith. In the distance, another howl returned. This was not Ira's howl coming forth, but another's. \"Judith?\" called Ira. The howl rose again. It was hard to pick up on a direction in the confusing woods through the haze. Again, a pained howl rose from the woods, heartbreak filled the wail of the caller. It is the type of baying one might wish to do when overcome with grief, but oftentimes feels too foolish to do so. \"There's no mistaking it,\" Ira said over his shoulder, \"it's Judith.\" \"How can you be sure that it's Judith calling? It's just howling.\" asked Max, who would never admit that the howls sent shivers down his spine. His mind reeled at the idea of pursuing such unearthly sounds, and yet his heart was drawn to the far off pleas. \"That's the power of love.\" Answered K.W. Wise and understanding, her word was taken as law. Behind her from Bernard's back, Max could see Alexander shaking his head. \"Love is crazy.\" Alexander muttered. As usual, Alexander's dismissive comments went unnoticed, much to his dismay. Though much had changed on their island, certain things would always remain the same. When another howl pierced through the woods, Ira returned it with a howl of his own. \"Judith!\" called Ira into the winding forest. Another howl came, even more distressed, but its volume diminishing rapidly. \"King, we must find her.\" \"Call to her again,\" urged Max, \"I think she heard you.\" Letting out a piercing howling that rocked through Max's ears, Ira looked from side to side in anticipation. No one dared speak fearing that they might miss her cry back. When Ira's howl was returned, he bounded off in its general direction, paying no heed to those following him or what lay in front of him. Those who were left behind tried to keep pace in vain and were forced to following the path he had laid out for them with a hastened speed. \"Judith!\" cried Ira, bounding through the twisty vines of the birch trees. Under his weight they snapped like twigs, and with every wailed reply from Judith his strength grew. Max did everything in his power to cling to Ira's back and watch the mysterious and expanding forest ahead. The further along they went, the thicker the fog became. Soon, all that was left to remind Max that his friends were still in tow were their shouts calling after them. \"Ira, we should wait for them.\" Pleaded Max, feeling sick from the speed at which they were travelling. Beneath him, Ira gave a dismissive grunt. All Max could do was hold tight to Ira, and pray that Judith would be before them soon. Eventually, Ira and Max had reached a point where one could only see about a foot ahead of them. Begrudgingly Ira had to slow down. His steps calculated, Ira and Max remained silent, their ears in tune for Judith's cries. None came. \"She's here.\" Ira whispered over his shoulder. \"How do you know?\" asked Max. Ira lifted Max from his shoulders, but kept Max's hand in his, which was so petit in comparison to his large claws. \"Her scent, it's here, it's faint, but it's here and it's everywhere.\" Ira told him, his gaze shifting around, seeking Judith's location. Behind them, an out of breath band of friends finally caught up, too tired to chastise. The fog, thick and winding, was overpowering and all that anyone could see. Max felt something creep around his leg. Crying out, his call was interrupted when the force attempted to pull him to the earth. Ira, feeling the pull, lifted Max up once more. \"What was that?\" demanded K.W. anxiously, examining the silhouetted form of Max. \"Something grabbed me!\" Max replied. \"I told you I wasn't lying.\" Muttered Alexander from the safety of Bernard's back. \"No one doubted you.\" assured K.W. The fog they had been enveloped in for what seemed like an eternity started to withdraw. Fear, which had been overwhelming Max for so long on this journey, was absent at this moment. Instead, Max felt empowered, excited even. Warping and packing together, the thick fog formed a cloudy monster. Where there was once fog was now a dark forest, and it was revealed that the group had found a clearing. \"It's Judith!\" declared Ira. Indeed, in the center of the foggy creature was Judith, wrapped in billowing, evil fog. \"What shall we do?\" asked Alexander, still atop Bernard. Max knew it was he who was being called upon. The massive fog creature growled in front of them, readying for battle. Drawing in a breath, Max charged forward, dropping Ira's claw. \"Attack!\" he cried. Behind him his friends rushed to his side, growling and gnashing their teeth in a terrifying manner. Max was never more proud or happy to have them on his side. Meeting the fog beast, the group was careful to avoid hitting Judith at its center. To their horror, they found their blows went straight through the creature. Ira let out a snarl more vicious than one could expect coming from someone as mild mannered as he. \"King, what's happening?\" Ira asked. Persisting with blows to the beast in vain, Max was stuck for ideas. It was then the fog creature's turn to attack. Raising its great arm, it struck the group and sent them back with a gust of wind. Falling back, Max saw his friends break the birch trees with ease, even Alexander knocking down several before he could regain control. Max on the other hand felt dizzy upon hitting one, his focus going in and out. It was clear they needed a plan. Ira rushed forward. \"Grab Judith!\" called Max. \"Of course.\" replied Ira. Reaching for his love, Ira found the fog creature's core was pulling her back, fighting for control. An idea struck Max. \"Blow it away!\" said Max in realization. The group, aside from Ira who was still working to free Judith, looked to him with confusion. Without further explanation, Max ran forward and started to flap his hands at the creature to no avail. It was Alexander, the typical skeptic, who was first to join. This seemed to have some effect, as the creature started to dispel around its arm. Too absorbed in its fight with Ira, the beast did not fight back. K.W. and Bernard rushed to their aid, Bernard's strength especially working well. While the beast found itself broken up, Ira was able to free Judith with greater ease. He clung to her tightly, silently weeping from joy. When they had successfully dispelled the creature, Max and his friends joined Judith and Ira. In exhaustion, they plopped down ready for sleep. The fog had gone, and now one could see the night's sky that was coated in stars and seemed so warm but distant. \"Well that's that.\" Said Max with a yawn. For the remainder of the night they rested in a warm pile. For the first time in a great while Max felt that he could rest safely with his friends. In their arms, he was able to forget momentarily the challenges that lay in wait, and simply dream under the glowing stars.[Chapter 6] The light was soft rising above the isle of the wild things. Sitting in the long grass, Max watched over his slumbering friends in contemplation. It was sunrise, bed time for those on the wild side. They were in a grassy plain surrounded by low hills and jagged cliffs just outside of the forest they had escaped. Things were strange here, stranger than ever before. Max paced about, reminiscent of his princely days as royalty on this island. Friends had gone missing, and wounds and scars covered the ones he had found since then. Noticeably though, the fur coats of his friends had become smoother and softer, and their tense bodies seemed to ease. Something was happening here, and it was far bigger than any temper tantrum or loss of a king. Max let out a low growl, frustrated with overwhelming thoughts. \"Why me?\" he thought selfishly. As if on cue, K.W. stirred. Her massive brows furrowed in puzzlement, which caused Max to feel remorseful leading him to embarrassment and eventually to thoughts of his mother and sister. Smoothing his hair back, Max prepared to walk away when K.W. finally spoke. \"Max, why are you up? It's late man.\" She said, shielding her eyes from the increasingly present sun. \"I'm okay,\" he said in a non-answer. K.W. frowned, but said nothing. Max always had trouble escaping that K.W. saw to his core and through his excuses. Somehow he knew that she understood his thoughts, but nonetheless she allowed him his peace. \"I'm sorry. I'll go to sleep soon, I just need to, I don't know, think for a minute.\" Nodding, K.W. returned to her seemingly calm sleep, and Max felt envy at her ability to sleep so easily. He said nothing of his insomnia that kept him awake at odd hours and sent him to bed for brief moments of relief. At first he had taken cold medicine from his mother's cabinet to do what his body could not, but the task had started to feel dirty once his mother had noticed the missing pills. Mark had suspected him, but his mother, idealistic to a fault, came to his defense and washed Max with overwhelming guilt. Now he rode out the storm of the drowsiness that would never allow sleep. These thoughts, the troubling thoughts, were the ones that plagued him endlessly and kept him awake. Deciding it was more relaxing to think of the task at hand, Max wondered what was next for him and his friends. \"K.W., Ira, Judith, Alexander, Bernard, Carol…\" he whispered, counting off his friends on his fingers. Supposedly, K.W., Bernard, and Alexander knew where Carol was, so that left one accounted for. Then there was Bob and Terry, who had gone missing awhile back, Max guessed K.W. would want to seek them out next. There was one missing though, and pausing, it took only an instant for the memories of the peacekeeper to return. Yes, it was Douglas, fun-loving and masterfully calm; his missing presence had gone unnoticed by Max until now. If possible, Max wanted to find him next, knowing that Douglas could be key in suppressing Carol's temper. A plan set, Max drew closer to his friends. Resting at Bernard's side, Max still felt no sleep coming. He was caught off guard when Bernard's great arm drew him in closer in a tight but cozy hug. Alexander too was near and his breaths rose soothing in steady. After a while Max's attempts at sleep were less forced, and he fell into a shallow sleep. When Max woke up, it was not on his own accord, but the violent shaking of his shoulder. His eyes opened rapidly in panic, fearing the worst. A vast shadow swept over him and the one shaking him. Dead center in the sky was the sun, which meant it was noon, too early for wild things to wake in normal circumstance. \"Get up king!\" urged Judith, who had been the one shaking them. \"What's going on?\" he asked. \"They've found us. Oh, I should have known this would happen! Nothing ever goes right; I don't know why I was so stupid to come with you. I'm really foolish sometimes.\" answered Judith, whose response had suddenly taken shape into a slightly self-effacing rant. Looking around, Max spotted K.W. wielding a boulder. Beside her Ira flung a log towards a nearby cliff. It was then that Max realized that they too were being fired upon. Flaming rocks were being hurled their way. He watched as Alexander narrowly dodged a particularly large in size flame engrossed rock. \"Watch it!\" he called up to the cliffs. Beside Alexander Bernard held a massive rock of his own, seeking a target. Upon the hills were catapults, operating on their own somehow. Max turned to Judith who had stayed by his side, deflecting any fire-rocks that came their way. Missing a rock, it barely made it past Max without colliding into him. \"Shit.\" He cursed, seeing his singed shirt. \"Oh king! This is why I'm no good at these things, but then again, that was your fault you know. You can't always rely on your subjects; you should jump in front of me dramatically and save me. That is what a good king would do any-.\" \"There's no time for this Judith, we need to get out of here.\" said Max. \"Right, you tell us how and we'll make it happen.\" She said. Looking about, Max felt helpless and did not know what to do. They were on low ground, their invisible enemy having the advantage. From what Max had seen in war movies, this called for two options, either retreat for safety, which meant returning to the woods, or rushing up the hill at the ones flinging the fiery rocks, which could be dangerous. It was clear either way was perilous. Having gone through the forest before, Max did not feel particularly up to traversing through again. \"K.W.! Bernard! Alexander! Ira!\" he shouted, getting their attention along with Judith's. Looking to him eagerly, they awaited for him to unveil his plan. Instead, Max let out a howl to be much applauded by any amongst the wild things and charged up the things. Behind him Judith let out a yowl, following him with claws and sharp teeth bared. Ira followed his lover with a holler, his feet pounding at the ground. K.W., Bernard, and Alexander wasted no time of their own following Max up the hill with their wails rocking the surrounding trees. The rocks from the hills subsided until they were no more. By the time they had all reached the crest of the hill, the enemy was gone. Max could not suppress his excitement, and with a yell he jumped in the air. \"Yeah!\" he cried. His friends joined him in celebration at their small victory. Not once did Max think it stupid to show such emotion, for right then it was a show of honest exhilaration. Ira picked him up and swung him once around causing Max to laugh. \"We did it!\" said Judith. \"I didn't think we could, but we did, you're amazing king!\" \"He's not a king.\" Muttered Alexander, knowing whatever volume his protests were, they would fall on deaf ears regardless. \"What now king?\" asked Judith. \"He's not a king.\" muttered Alexander again. At first Max was silent, his attention on the ground where the once stood moments ago. Debris left over from their attackers left scorch marks in their wake on the earth. In the center of the flames Max noticed that the fires were not carried by rocks, but by heads, gigantic teddy bear heads. Their beaded eyes reflect the sparse blazes almost like tears ready to fall, and Max could not help but feel a little bit disturbed. \"Strange.\" He murmured. \"King?\" called K.W. \"He's not a king.\" muttered Alexander once more. \"Yes?\" asked Max. \"What's next then? Well, I've been thinking, where's Douglas?\" The expressions of his friends became very somber. Even Bernard's stoic face bared a hint of sorrow and guilt. So they did know where Douglas had gone to. This would make things easier, Max supposed, and would mean that Douglas would be their next friend to find. \"He went,\" K.W. thought of what to say, \"He was the first to disappear after Carol became what he is now.\" \"He wanted to see what was causing things to turn to dust.\" added Alexander, always the blunt one. \"He wouldn't let us go with him because he thought it might be dangerous, but he never returned. Before anyone could go after him, Bob and Terry went missing too, and then the fires started. It was a complete mess, you know?\" explained K.W. \"Do you know how to get to him?\" \"To the dust?\" asked Ira. \"Of course, it is growing every day.\" \"Where?\" asked Max. \"The north, king.\" said Ira. \"He's not a king!\" muttered Alexander. This time, to Alexander's dismay, the entire group heard his comment. If wild things could blush, Alexander would be very red. He did not like this much attention, no matter how much he yearned for it, Alexander never felt quite prepared or ready for it. Twiddling his hands and moving his weight from one leg to the other, he grew very small with the added attention. \"How could you say that?\" asked Judith, Max too taken aback to say anything. \"Well he's not king.\" said Alexander. \"He's our friend.\" Max's face was intangible; stepping forward he looked to Alexander who looked unsure of himself or how Max might react. \"Well, do you know how to reach the dust?\" asked Max. Alexander nodded, and Max broke into a great smile. \"Then lead the way. We'll follow and protect you, friend.\" said Max. \"Now, let's find Douglas.\"[Chapter 7] \"Carol!\" called Douglas, \"Carol! Carol!\" The whipping winds that carried the sands were Douglas' only reply. The weeks that he had been searching for Carol had slipped into months, years even. As he walked he continued to call through the hazy red daylight. \"Carol!\" he called. His voice did not travel far over the winds, so he had to strain his lungs to reach an adequate distance. No reply came. Wiping the sand away that clung to his wooden arm, Douglas pressed on over the sandy plain. It was his responsibility to restore order, and the first priority was to find Carol and set things right. This task proved to be tricky with seemly infinite plains of sand that multiplied day by day in their eternity. So long as Carol was missing, Douglas was sure that they would continue to expand until their island was no more and the sun, strained by its efforts, would surrender and extinguish. How this journey had started and how it had spun so wildly out of control, were thoughts that prevailed constantly with Douglas. \"Carol!\" he shouted once more. Wind whipped the sand, blinding him. His heavy feet shoved into the loose sand, slowing his journey. Regardless, he pushed forward calling out, thinking only of the past and the future. The present was too grim and sandy. He thought of Bob and Terry, those damn foolish birds. They had much to say, but when it came to the feelings of others, their intuition was moot. There was a chance Douglas could come across them too, assuming they had not become sand. It was perfectly possible; Carol had not finished them off, thinking The End would find them. \"Carol!\" Douglas called. Before he could call once more he swore he heard the familiar howl of his lost companion. White noise made him unsure. The End was playing tricks. Douglas flopped down on the ground where he had stood, lying motionless. The wind coated him with sand only to clear it just as quickly. The endless wind and lack of food pulled at his core. All he had left was his final memory of Carol before The End had become so overwhelming. The disappearance of Bob and Terry, the suspicion that drove their once tightknit group apart, and one by one, the unraveling of his friend's. It was because The End, because Carol was so easily overcome with its feelings of darkness. With a roar Douglas lifted himself from the sand. He had to carry on; he had to find Carol, if not for Carol, for himself. ","Summary":" \"Max? Max?\" A knock rapped on his wooden door, but he gave no response.

Vincent hated burlesque and he hated the club. Her club. He only worked so hard to save it because he didn't want to admit that he'd failed at something. But he didn't save it. Ali did, the waitress from Iowa turned out to be Tess' s saving grace. He nodded and flashed a smile. \"I even paid admission.\" \"Good for you, I'm glad you approve. Now if you don't mind.\" She grabbed her bag and an arm load of costumes and moved towards the door. \"I'm going home. \" \"You should be celebrating, Tess you're back on top, Baby!\" He clapped his hands together gleefully. The sound echoed in the small space. \"And you're loaded. You stink like stale booze and I know nobody here served you. I did my celebrating the night I handed over that check.\" \"With Sean?\" He asked harshly. \"Maybe! Why the fuck do you care? We're divorced, I don't have to answer to you. \" She threw her hands in the air. Now go downstairs and call a cab. \" \"Come on, Tess just have a drink with me. \" \"You've had enough for one night, Vincent. \" She shoved past him and he caught her arm. His lips covered hers before she could respond. Her mouth melded against his with a mind of its own. She pulled back for breath, \"what the fuck, Vincent!\" She shoved him by the shoulders. Her boots gave her a couple extra inches, so she towered over him. \"It's like Fight Club.\" He said simply. \"What? Get away from me, now before I call the cops. You don't kiss your exe's like that!\" \" You wouldn't call the cops if I punched you in the face. You definitely won't call them over a kiss.\" He had her there. She could take a punch as easily as a kiss. It wasn't worth tarnishing the club's reputation; but let someone lay a foul hand on one of the girls or Sean and she'd call the Army if she had to. \"You got me. Now get out.\" \"Everything that happens tonight is like Fight Club.\" \"Nothing is happening tonight!\" \"This is just like when we were married, \" he huffed. \"You were never any fun. You danced for money in front of hundreds of men in a week but I couldn't make you dance for me.\" \"Well I'm not a stripper! I don't give lap - dances and you never understood that. \" \"I was lucky to get a blow job before you left to come here.\" \"You poor neglected thing,\" she said in mocking pity. Her bottom lip pouted slightly, \"if I'm so dull then explain to me why you're so Hell bent on sleeping with me now. \" \"I don't want a relationship, Tess. \" \"That's a good-damn thing.\" She scoffed, \"believe me, I didn't divorce you because I enjoyed your company as stimulating as this conversation is, I'm done. Call a cab and a hooker. \" She breezed past him stalling on the top stair. \"What's that line in your opening number? Everyone is buying, put your money in my hand...I forgot the rest. \" \"You're starting to piss me off, Vince. \" She turned around and he was standing behind her. \"I'll leave you alone if you just sing it for me.\" He was starting to sober up and she didn't like it. \" Everyone is buying put your money in my hand, if you're got a little extra, give it to the band. Satisfied? \"Not that line. The other one.\" \"Alright, fine. You're an assshole. The question is, were you born that way?\" \"I like to think I was cultivated, now sing the line like a lullaby. Picture Georgia ' s baby as you're singing. \" \"You're nuts.\"She rolled her eyes, \"this isn't winning you any points. \" \"Just do it and I'll leave you alone.\" \"Fine.\" When she sang, she slowed the tune the lyrics spilled from her lips like a gentle smoke coming from a fireplace on a cold day. \"Everyone is buying, put your money in my hand, if you want a little extra, well, you know where I am. \"You're a real piece of shit, Vincent. \" \"And while we're on the subject of the obvious, that line makes you sound like a whore. Whose idea was that? \" \"I'm fed up with your shit, Vince. I wrote the song! My club doesn't cater to kids, I'm an entertainer and I don't have to be politically correct! Now you said you would leave me alone. \" \"Everyone is buying, your ex husband doesn't quite understand, but he's got a little extra and he's just a man,\" He sang. She laughed and said, \"you can't carry a tune in a bucket. If this is your idea to try and win me over it won't work. \" \"You will dream of Vincent, \" he continued, butchering her lyrics. \"Do it at your risk, it's not the end of time. It's just your body on top of mine. \" \"Smooth.\" She laughed, \"if you give me another good one I'll give you what you want. But,\" she held up one finger. \"It has to be in-key.\" \"You'll really do it?\" \"Sure. Across the desk in my office. \" \"Bareback?\" He arched his eyebrow hopefully. \"Fuck no, I don't know where you've been! Condom. Now sing.\" \"So I guess the third time, really is the charm. I got Tess to say yes, what really is the harm?\"He grinned. \"Cute, but no.\" She smiled, \"keep trying.\" She teased. \"You were way off.\" \"What does 'in-key' even mean? \" He chuckled, \" Just shut up and kiss me.\" \"This doesn't change anything, \" she said as his lips crashed on hers again. \"No, it doesn't.\" \"Hold on a minute.\" She held up one finger as they stepped into her office. \"You want something special?\" \"Hell yes.\" His smokey gaze drank her in. She opened the door of the closet and closed the door. \" Stay there. \" She wanted this, she deserved it. She slid down the zipper on her dress. A slinky, glittering, bandaid of a dress; but it wasn't enough tonight. The sound of hollow metal and sliding hangers filled the large closet as she assessed each costume before deciding. One night of pure fun with a familiar face and she could cross another item off her bucket list. \"Ta Da!\" Leaned against the door frame she let Vince have his fill of her; clad in a charcoal colored corset with red lace accents, silken fish-nets and pumps. \"Damn,\" he hissed, \"this is worth waiting for.\" He caressed her hair, brushing the pin - straight locks away from her breasts. Clothes were shed; and on a covering of ostrich feather fans, surrounded by glittering costumes and fake pearls, together, they reached nirvana.[Chapter 2] \"We didn't even make it inside the office.\" Vincent stretched his arm over his head, fully satiated, glitter shinning on his chest hair; with Tess' s curtain of ink black hair spread over his chest. \"Kinda feels like our honeymoon.\" \"No it doesn't. You can't tell Sean what we did in here, he'd kill us both if he knew how we violated his props.\" She said, rolling away from him. The whole room reeked like sex, cheap booze and sweat. She wanted to clean it up and go home. \"I'm sure one of his boy - toys can arrange something as a replacement. \" He said with a snort. \"Consider yourself lucky that corset is still in one piece. \"Why are you so caught up on Sean? We need the props for the show, he has every right to be upset, but I'll spring for the dry cleaning bill so he'll never know. \" \"We said this is like Fight Club, Tess.\" He stretched and his back popped as he got to his feet. \"Do you want a ride home?\" \"No, I'm fine here, you should call a cab.\" She said, picking up his pants from the floor and handing them over. \"Is this your way of saying it's over?\" He handed over her bra before pulling his shirt on. \" It's been over, Vincent, a long time before this.\" The kicker was, she didn't even feel bad. She wasn't ashamed, she wasn't angry. She wasn't anything. Nothing, she felt absolutely nothing for this man that at one point she pledged to spend her life with. \"You're right.\"He grabbed his coat from the floor. \"I'll see you. \" And the door closed, the sound of footsteps on the metal staircase abated. She shoved the feather fans in the corner of the closet and doused the room in air fresher. \"Bye.\" She said to the empty room. She went down to the bar, they had closed the club hours ago. All the girls left after the final number. Tess reached across the bar and poured a shot of tequila; drinking alone wasn't all that bad. Fuck Vincent. Fuck his cheating ass and who gives a fuck if it was years ago. He still cheated on her, he still stumbled in drunk every other day of their marriage. He couldn't drink at the club and support her, oh no he had to stick his dick in everything that walked while she worked to keep the place going. Part of her knew he enjoyed humiliating her with every thrust inside some bar fly. Okay, maybe she was a little bit ashamed of herself. She downed another shot, straight from the bottle. Fuck the glass, too. Maybe she was a little angry, a little bitter. Everything he did was payback, she deserved it for running a business instead of her household. Fuck that, twice. \"Hey, Gorgeous.\" Like clockwork, Vincent left and Sean entered. \"Got enough for two?\" \"Always.\" She slurred, her head rested on the cool stone bar-top. \"Too bad. \" He reached for the bottle and screwed the cap back on and replaced it on the other side of the bar. \"You're cut off, now what's with the liver abuse?\" \"I thought you left.\" Without saying goodbye, never. Now tell Sean all about it.\" He began massaging her shoulders, trying to remove some of the weight they carried. \"I hate my ex husband, Sean I hate him more than anyone in the whole world!\" \"Honey, I hate your ex husband, everyone hates him. What happened tonight?\" \"I hate him! I hate how much he hurt me, he never wanted me or the club; he only stuck around when it was good for him.\" He leaned in close, \"he's a selfish prick, Tess and he didn't deserve you.\" He said in her ear. \"I fucked him!\" She confessed, \"all over the closet, he kept going on and on about how boring I was when we were married and I just-I don't know- I wanted to prove to him that I'm not.\" Sean stopped massaging, \"you don't have to prove jack shit to him, Tess.\" \"I know-but-\" She raised up to look at him with glassy eyes. She didn't deserve this, her tears were too special to be wasted on a piece of shit like Vincent. \"Clearly you don't know, now come on and let me drive you home. I won't let you sit here and puddle over some man whore who gave you a ring. \" \"Why are you being so fucking mean, Sean?\" \"I'm not. It's not a judgement, it's the truth. Now come on, we're going to sober you up and you can sleep it off.\" \" Look here, Sean Boy, I may be drunk off my ass, but I know my house is in the other direction. \" Tess said from the back seat of Sean's car at least her mood was improving. \"We're going to my house.\" He lowered the window on her side, the cool summer breeze whipped through the car as he drove down the interstate; \"just sit back and relax.\" \"Just shut up and take me home. \" He parked on the curbside and opened her door, chivalry isn't dead after all. She looked up, lifting her head from her lap. \"What's your plan?\" \"You're going to eat and sleep and I'll take you home tomorrow. \" \"When did you become such a mother hen?\" She asked, stepping, more like falling out of the car. He caught her arm, \"when you decided it was a good idea to slam half a bottle of tequila in twenty minutes.\" He helped her up the steps, she kept a death grip on the railing. \"As fabulous as those shoes are, consider them confiscated until you can see straight.\" He said and unlocked the door. \"You are way too good to me. \" She said and sat down on the sofa, her head lolled to one side against the arm. \"Everyone is entitled to a night of reckless sex, \" He called from the kitchen; heating a pan and cracking eggs into a bowl. \"Not me, \" she countered and propped her hand under her head to stay upright. \" My entire marriage was nothing but a giant mistake.\" Sean reappeared with two steaming plates of scrambled eggs and buttered toast. \"The good thing is-\" \"We didn't have kids.\" \"I was going to say at least you got to keep the club.\" He sat next to her, putting their plates on the coffee table. \"We would have done a number on kids, I'd be paying therapy bills until the day I died.\" He pulled her close until her head was leaned against his chest. \"Stop feeling sorry for yourself and eat your eggs. \" \"Stop bitching at me.\" \"Everything will look brighter in the morning, \" he said and began to play with her hair. Screw the eggs, he'd rub her back while she slept, like he always did when shit hit the fan and make breakfast in the morning.[Chapter 3] \"Will you please stop throwing food at me.\" Tess moaned, trying to shield her eyes from the sunlight streaming through the living room window. Another plate of eggs sat in front of her, an omelet with broccoli, ham and cheese. \"Sorry. \" Sean slid the curtains closed and sat a trash can by her feet. \"Do you think you'll be sick?\" \"I don't know, Honey, I haven't drank that much in forever.\" \"Tess, you can do a full show in four inch pumps after twice as much vodka. I've seen you do it.\" \"That's vodka, \" she said flatly, \"with a chaser and food; but in all fairness, you did try to feed me.\" \"True. \" \"Thanks for taking care of me last night.\" He could have left her to puddle at the bar, she'd wake up on the floor with no clue how she got there. \"Any time.\" He wanted to tell her not to make a habit of sleeping with her ex in the dressing room of the club, but thought better of it. \" Now if you don't eat this, I'll start to think you don't like my cooking.\" \"That's because it sucks,\" she joked and speared a small bit on her fork. \"It's better than yours, \" he countered and smiled. \"Good point,\" she was lucky not to burn water; thank God for the pizza place two blocks from her house otherwise she would probably starve. She caught him staring, his inquisitive eyes bore into her cheek. \"I'll be alright, Sean,\" She said softly, \"I've done a lot worse things.\" \"I know. \" He brushed it off, like he wasn't concerned about her well being. \"I was just making sure you weren't going to puke on my couch. \" She smiled and kicked the wastebasket away. \"Don't worry about that either. \" She was so lucky to have him and he knew it. \"I'll take you to get your car when you're ready.\" \"Thanks, Ali busted out of her costume last night and I have to fix it before we open.\" \"Are we sure Niki didn't rip it?\" He asked dryly. Tess laughed, \"Give her some credit, she's been nicer.\" \"I should have busted out her window a long time ago. \" He was the only person she told about that and she wasn't about to apologize for it. \" That is so beneath you. \" He snickerd and said, \"I know, but it's true. \" -'- Tess plugged the hot glue gun into the wall, piecing together the glittering chains that, when attached to a leotard, made up the golden costumes for the first number. They were hand made and had to be hand sewn and repaired. Her head was pounding, if she drank tonight she would definitely have a hang over in the morning. The night before still sparkled in her memory, Vincent wasn't any different than the day she divorced him, but it was fun and safe. She could be herself with him, exactly who she was and he wouldn't hate her. She could hate his guts and she told him so, frequently; but he still gave a shit. He tried to save the club for her, but he didn't see any other options. Could she hate him for giving up so easily, yes. She could and she did. But reckless sex had nothing to do with business and she could do that without fear of losing anything because you can't lose what's already gone. Piecing together Ali's costume helped her piece together her life, maybe Fight Club, wasn't such a bad idea. But could she do it without hating herself? Would she need tequila after every time they were together? Probably not, eventually, she would switch to vodka and spare herself the hang over. She lifted the receiver from its hook on the desk and dialed. He picked up on the first ring. \"I've come to a decision,\" she greeted cooly. Confidence and excitement fizzled through her body. \"And what would that be?\" he wondered. His curiosity was peaked. \"Fight Club is an excellent idea.\" \"Tess, I love the way you think. So, I was thinking... You and me. After the show. What do you say? We'll sneak off,\" he suggested. \"Not back into the closet,\" she deadpanned. \"I was thinking about the Hilton.\" She rolled her eyes, but there was a smile on her face. \"Big spender.\" \"Never. But I'm not cheap, either. Unlike you.\" He caught himself a moment too late. Shit! His ex wife had called him out of the blue and agreed to casual sex, with him - no less! - and he called her cheap. \"God, Tess,\" he tried to apologize. \"That was wrong. I'm an asshole, I didn't mean it like that.\" For a second, he thought she had hung up on him. But then he heard her breathing on the other end. \"Yeah, you did, you prick,\" she returned evenly. \"And for that, you're springing for room service.\" \"Deal.\"[Chapter 4] \"Going somewhere? \" Sean asked, Tess was sitting at her mirror backstage, the curtain had already fallen for the final time that night and all the girls were headed home. She pulled out her lipstick from her purse and swiped the color across her lips. \"Maybe, \" she responded vaguely. It wasn't really any of Sean's business, \"why?\" \"Because you look excited, \" he said, gushing. He was almost one of the girls at times, with a feather boa slung across his shoulders, leaving a pink feathery trail in his wake. \"By the end of the night you're ready to pack it in and go home, not tonight, huh?\"She caught his eyes through the mirror, he looked worried. His eyebrows knitted, bringing attention to his bald head. \"No, not tonight. \" She applied another coat of mascara and dipped the wand back in the tube. \"I have a date.\" \"And?\" He pressed, \"where's he taking you? Somewhere lavish, I hope. \" She laughed, \"The Hilton.\" \"Nice...\" he nodded his approval, \"penthouse suite? \" \"Probably not. \" \"Darn. Too bad.\" He pouted, \"The Queen deserves nothing but the best. \" She shook her head in amusement and got up. \"You're so full of shit, Sean. Good night!\" She waved slightly and headed for the stairs her 4 inch heels clacking down the metal staircase. \"Have fun! \" He called, \"don't do anything I wouldn't.\" \"And what would that be? Learn his name?\" \"When in doubt, say, Mike. \" He could hear her laughing as she walked down the stairs. God, he loved her and she knew it. -'-'- Tess pulled in front of the hotel, with butterflies soaring in her stomach. Why this was different, she couldn't figure out; but it was and she loved it. The man she was married to would have never taken her to The Hilton, he wouldn't buy meat if he could avoid it. Although, she thought bitterly, he could afford to have multiple affairs. The thoughts entered her mind before she could stop them and unshed anger pierced her gut. Damn him. She shook her head and tried to clear her thoughts of the past. She didn't need it, holding onto it wasn't helping. A tap on the window startled her. \"Holy shit!\" She jumped and slammed on the horn. \"Vince, don't do that!\" She pulled the door handle and stepped out of the car allowing the valet to take over. He was laughing, clutching his ribs. \"Did I scare you?\" \"No,\" she said defiantly. Her hand came up over her heart, accentuating the V that dipped down her dress. \"What's in that?\" She nodded towards the bag in his hand. \"You'll see,\" he teased and grinned mischievously. \"If you think you're hand-cuffing me to anything, I'm out of here,\" she warned. He shook his head, \"it's nothing like that, Tess. I promise, you will love it. He reached inside and held the package out just long enough for her to read the label. \"Thanks!\" Something unfamiliar spread through her, he didn't forget. \"I remember, it was your favorite when we were married. \" He took her arm and led her towards the hotel. \"It was. \" She smiled brightly, \"I guess I forgot that I wasn't the only person in our marriage.\" \"You weren't the only one who liked good sushi either. \" A beat of silence and he said, \"I never forgot the good times, Tess. \" \"Problem being, \" she said and he cut her off with a response of his own. \"There weren't very many? \" He cracked a smile to let her know he was kidding. His arm settled around her back and she didn't pull away. \"I hate valet parking, \" she grumbled. \"Why? Because you can't make a quick getaway? \" He asked, holding open the door to the hotel. She laughed and shook her head, \"when did you get so paranoid? \" \"About the same time you became fun.\" He handed over his credit card to the pretty girl across the counter. \"Reservations for Scali, Vincent.\" She ran the card and he could feel her eyes drilling into his face with a come hither gaze. \"Of course.\" She flashed him a bold smile. \"I have you right here in the deluxe suite. \" He pulled Tess closer in a possessive grasp. He was a taken man tonight and the pretty thing behind the counter wasn't going to ruin that. \"We'll need some champagne and strawberries sent in as soon as possible. \" The other woman nodded and handed over their key cards. \"Enjoy your stay in room 406.\" Tess couldn't help herself as she hit the button for the elevator. \"Good job, Vince,\" sarcasm rolled off her tongue. \"What? \" Confusion colored his tone. \"You restrained yourself.\" She nodded, he deserved a reward for that. \"What are you talking about?\" He asked as they climbed into the elevator. \"Oh please, even I could see her panties melting as soon as you walked in the door,\" she scoffed. \"Well you should know, you're a professional Panty Melter.\" \"Awe... such a compliment. Do I make your panties melt, Vince?\" She teased. They stepped into the hall and the elevator doors slid shut behind them \"Every day.\" She couldn't stop the smile that spread across her face. \"You're not right in the head, Mr. Scali. \" \"I never claimed to be, \" he shrugged his shoulders and slid his key card in the door. \"But I married you, didn't I?\" He caught himself a second too late. \"Oh dammit...Tessa...I'm a dick. I didn't realize how bad that came out. \" \"Up yours. Do you ever think before you talk or does this stupid shit just fall out of your mouth? \" He swallowed sheepishly, \"I really didn't mean it,\" he said softly. \"I think you're still bitter that I divorced you,\" she replied smoothly and began toying with the miro-buttons on her dress, the creaminess of her breasts was enhanced by her hands against them. \"Now that I'm back on top, without.\" She revealed her black lace bra. \"Your help. \" Vincent couldn't keep his eyes off of her. He kicked the door with the heel of his foot and it slammed closed. \"You're trying to backtrack. And if you think, \" she stepped in close to him and opened the top button of his shirt. \"That you're getting any part of my club or my money.\" She opened his fly and hit her knees. \"You're out of your mind.\"[Chapter 5] The sound of a blaring phone threw Tess into the land of the living. With one arm flung over her face and the other hand underneath Vincent's head. \"Good God, make it stop! \" \"Alright,\" Vincent growled and picked up the phone, \"who ordered the wakeup call? \" he didn't drop the surly tone. \"Uh huh. Tess, wake up.\" He nudged her lightly and covered the receiver with his hand. \"Who knows that we're here?\" \"Just Sean.\" She yawned and pulled the blanket tighter around herself, to cover her best assets and settled back in bed. Of course, he thought to himself; Tess told him everything. Too much, in his opinion. \"Yeah I know who it is,\" he growled. \"Send him through. \" \"Sleeping Beauty, you have a phone call.\" He passed her the receiver. She rolled her eyes and crawled closer to the cradle. \"Somebody better be dying.\" \"Tess?\" Tears filled the other woman's voice. All earlier tiredness forgotten, Tess sat up straight. \"Georgia? What's wrong?\" \"I need help.\" The sounds of a baby crying split through the phone. \"Damon's useless, I've been awake for days. \" Georgia sobbed, \" all Chloe does is cry anymore!\" \"Is Sean still there?\" Sympathy filled her tone. \"Yeah,\" she hiccuped. \"It's alright, let me talk to him. \" An ear splitting shriek filled Tess' ear. \"Sorry to crash your morning,\" Sean said dryly. \"What the hell is going on there?\" Tess asked, aggravated; how could he be so sarcastic at- what time was it? She reached for the alarm clock next to the phone. 7AM? \"I got a distress call from Damon, Georgia's at the end of her rope with this parenting thing.\" \"Well who has Chloe?\" Tess heard the 3 month old in question scream in answer. \"Me.\" \"Good. Take her into the bedroom, eventually she'll cry herself out. Give Georgia a break and let Damon bring you endless bottles of formula and clean diapers like the bump on a log that he is.\" She reached across the bed for her bag sidestepping the case to the dirty movie Vince brought and the empty sushi takeout box from her favorite restaurant in L.A. \"I'm on my way.\" \"What was that about?\" Vincent asked. She hung up the phone and pulled on her panties. \"I have to go. Sorry Vince, maybe next time we won't have to-err-try so hard. \" \"Look, it's not my fault.\" He said indignation filled his tone, \"I'll get a prescription. \" \"We got old, no hard feelings. \" She plucked her dress off the floor and slid into it and stuffed her feet back into their pumps. \"Zip me up?\" She bared her back to him and he slid the zipper in place, laying a kiss on the side of her neck. \"Where are you rushing off to?\" He rubbed his beard against the tender skin. \"Damon called Sean, Georgia's having a hard time with the baby. \" \"So why did they call you?\" She pulled away from him, frustration rolled off of her. \"Who did you call when you were young and in trouble?\" \"My parents. \" She gave him a look as if to say, 'yeah, stupid.' Frustration filled her tone, \" and I'm pretty much all that girl's got in that department. \" Georgia was 18 and chasing Hollywood stardom when her parents kicked her to the curb. She came to the club and hadn't left. \"Why you?\" \"Why not me?\" She fired back, \"I've played nursemaid, shrink and mother to every one of those girls.\" \"That's rich,\" he laughed dryly, \"you don't have a maternal bone in your body. \" Hurt crossed her features, what a nice thing to say to someone who you wanted to start a family with once upon a time. \"You really know how to make a girl feel good.\" God, what was wrong with him? He just couldn't keep his mouth shut. He had to do something to salvage the situation. He reached toward her tenderly brushing her arm with his fingertips and she pulled away. \"I'm sorry, Tess but you know it's true.\" \"You don't think I know that! I don't need you to tell me that but who else does she have?\" \"Whatever.\" He shrugged, \"I'll book this place for another night if you want to come back.\" \"No.\" She shook her head, her black hair swished around her face. \"Go see your doctor and I'll think about it; but I won't let you talk to me with such disrespect; Vince you've been a complete asshole since yesterday; with your backwards compliments. I'm going to take care of this and as for you and me, I'll think about it. \" ","Summary":" \"Hey. \" Tess turned around to see Vincent standing in the door of her office. \"I've been looking"},{"Movie":"Burlesque","Title":"Heart of Stone","Author":"givemeafeather1026","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7603931","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Any characters you see you recognize are not Rose is my creation. *Two years earlier* Sean: Hey Tess! Tess:What? Sean:I hear Ember has a performance tonight. Mind if I tag along? Tess:Sean,I would love for you to but, you know how Vince gets when you are involved in something to do with Ember. Sean:Yes I know but, I also know that Ember is my child as well and I should be able to see her perform at least once in her life. Tess:Shh, not so loud she may hear us. And hear them she did. *1 Year Later * Stagehand:Ember you are on in 10 Ember:OK, thanks. \"OK so Ember you wanna go over the set list or are you ok?,Ember? EMBER!\" \"What?,oh yeah I am good to go on the setlist.\" \"Sure? You seem a little distracted tonight\" \"Yeah I'm fine. I was just thinking about my parents is all.\" \"Oh honey, I know you miss them,but just remember that they are now in a better place\" \"Yeah, a better place\" \"Yep,mom is happily married to Vince still and Sean is still my moms best friend whom she is secretly in love with and I am nothing but a blur in their memories,a simple ripple in the little game they have going between the three of them.\" This is what I wanted to say to my manager Elyse,but I quickly remembered that I had originally told her that my parents were killed in a carwreck,and that is why she took me in and began to manage me. \"Ember you're on!\" I stepped up to the mic and it felt as though the lyrics just flew out of my mouth. It was if I was singing directly to my mother and I was singing I noticed a blonde woman in her late 20's early 30's walk into the did I know that that chance in counter would change mine and many other lives forever.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Welcome back to burlesque. As I was walking off the stage after the last song I was greeted by the blonde I had seen in the back at the start of the show. Aly: Hi, Ember is it? ER: Yeah what do you need? Aly: I just wanted to tell you how good you are I mean you are awesome. ER: Thanks, Aly: Your welcome. ER: Well you wanna hang out? Aly: You just met me and you wanna hang out?

Aly : yes you know she asked me if I worked for you and I told her I did. Tess: you wouldn't know how to get in touch with her would you? Aly: yes actually she gave me her number. Tess: Can you give it to me? Aly : sure why? Tess:Just do it!

Its your mom\"... TBC Please note that once I get at least 2 reviews I will update[Chapter 3] Sorry I have not updated lately but school has been crazy so today seeing as I am sick and bored my muse has thankfully decided she should come home *WARNING* Some sight language nothing too bad. Ember had been preparing herself for the call ever since she had asked Aly about Tess, although it seemed as though she had not prepared herself well enough as as soon as she heard her mom's voice she panicked and dropped the phone. Tess heard the clammer of the phone and she waited to see if someone would pick the phone back up but no one did. Ember Rose sat in her room at Elyse's house, who had become sort of a motherly figure to Ember once she told her the lie about her parents, wondering what she should I go see her or should I stay spent the rest of the evening debating the pros and cons, but sadly it seemed as though they were equal in number. * The next day.* Tess sat in her office crying, something she did a lot since her daughter had run away. \"Tess?\" Tess jumped at the sound of Sean's voice and turned around. \"Yes?\" Tess said tearfully. \"What happened?\" \"I don't know she picked the phone up and when I told her that it was me it sounded as though she dropped the phone. \"Oh I'm sorry honey, but I mean think of the shock it must have been for her\" \"For her? Excuse me but if anyone knows about shock it would be me I'm the one who found that damn note that said that she hated me and that it was my fault that she left.\" \"Look, I'm sorry ok didn't mean to upset you\" \"No I'm the one who should be sorry it's just that I thought that maybe this time I could finally find our little girl.\" \"What do you mean YOUR little girl?\" Vince had walked into the room unexpectedly scaring both Tess and Sean. \"I knew there was something going on between you two you little slut how could you?\" Vince walked over to Tess and slapped her across the face leaving a hand print behind. \"You keep your hands off of her!\" Sean told Vince his face becoming more red with rage by the second. \"She is my wife and I can do whatever the hell I want to to her!\" \"The hell you can!\" Sean reared back and punched Vince in the jaw knocking him to the floor. \"STOP IT ALL OF YOU!\" The three adults turned around and their jaws all dropped as they saw Ember standing in the doorway. \"THIS is why I left to begin with!\" Ember shouted at them all. Ember turned to attempt to leave and Tess followed after and caught up with her and grabbed her arm. \"Baby please!\" \"I'm not your baby anymore frankly I don't know what the hell I am anymore cause it seems as though my entire freaking life is nothing but a freaking lie.\" \"Please just give me a chance to explain!\" \"Fine\" TBC. *Must have at least 2 or more reviews please!*[Chapter 4] Chapter 4. Ember sat in a chair in her mom's office as she had done so many times before starring at her visibly shaken mother,however,unlike before she noticed how her mom had started to adorned the walls of what was once just a cold dark office with photos of her lost child. Tess sat with tears in her eyes trying to muster up the courage to talk to this sulky, yet beautiful teenage who at one point was her bright blue eyed jet black haired baby her blue eyes had darkened and her hair made that even more Tess opened her mouth and began to talk more or less. Tess:Ember,baby I am so sorry you had to see that,but I just want you to know that Vince isn't my husband anymore and I..I.. I am sorry baby I really am,about everything you have no clue how sick I've been ever since you ran away and I just don't know where to start or what to start with.. ER: How about starting with why you chose not to tell me Sean was my dad?Or why you didn't leave Vince when he began to drink why you were never there when I needed you. Tess:Ok the reason I didn't tell anyone other than Sean about him being your dad is because of what happened just now,because I knew abuse was to follow and I guess judging by my still tingling cheek I was the not leaving Vince thing goes the same way as well I was afraid he might hurt us seeing as how violent he always became when he was I'm not sure I follow on the not being there. ER:Well let me see you never showed up at any of my recitals or choir concerts and you never came to anything school related was I to think? Tess:*sigh* OK you have got me there I was a horrible mom in that aspect,but in my defense I do have everyone of them recorded. Ember looked at her mom and rolled her eyes and bit her cheek to keep from grinning. ER:Yes, I know that mother,but WHY? didn't you come? Tess:To be honest it was because I felt out of place you know here I was your mother in a room full of the other moms all of which I could have been the mother of.I mean come on how would you have felt if you were a 50-something year old in a room full of women half your age with your first child while some of them were working on their 3rd or 4th babies. ER: So you're saying that because of your own insecurities with your age you have made it to where I have felt inadequate my whole life? Tess:Sounds that way huh? ER:Um kinda. Tess:Ok I understand that,but what I don't understand is the note you left when you left I mean why so harsh on me and why not Vince too? He hasn't always been the worlds best dad. ER:Wait the note? I don't remember the note. Tess: Oh well here it is. Tess reached over to her drawer where she kept the info on Ember's disappering and handed it to her. Ember read over the note and slowly remembered writing it. It had said: To my dearest mother, I wish to inform you that today the day of my 15th birthday I Ember Rose shall leave and never return I also want you to know just how angry and hurt I am with you.I hate you and for as long as I live I shall never return to you no matter what so farewell and have a nice life you filthy tramp. Ember stifled a laugh at her dramatic little self. Tess: I am really sorry about whatever it is has made you hate me other than your dad and my not being there,but... *BEEP* Embers phone began to ring. Ember:Yes? Elyse:Where the hell are you? ER: I'm at my moms club talking to her Ember cringed at what had just come out of her mouth. Elyse:Wait what..? Ember quickly hung up and turned to Tess and said \"I am so gonna be dead in a few minutes. If only Ember had been lying... TBC. I will tell how AND why as soon as I get 2 reviews so read enjoy and review please![Chapter 5] Ember Rose stood up to leave her moms office at the same time that Vince appeared at the door. Vince: YOU! Your the reason my wife left me, your the reason my life is in shambles and your the reason that I started to drink in the first place! Tess: Vincent you know that she didn't cause any of those things, it was my choice to leave, your choice to ruin your own life and you are the one who started to drink because of your issues not because of Ember. Vince:How could you? Tess, how the hell could you with that wife stealing homewrecking jerk. Tess:Damnit Vince, can you not see that I don't love you I love Sean? While you were off getting drunk off your ass he was here helping with the buisness and during the let's see THREE times I put you through rehab he was here for me and you are so very wrong if you think that Ember had anything to do with this. ER: Okay you two please just stop. Ember was nearly in tears at the sight of Tess and Vince fighting once again. Vince:Okay I'll stop. I'll stop everything, begining with your LIFE! Out of nowhere Vince pulled out and gun and before Tess could stop him he shot Ember point blank in the head. Tess couldn't believe what she had just seen as her only child had just been murdered right before her own eyes. Or had she?

La participación de Supergirl ha sido escasa en general, independiente que la hayan dedicado en algunos cómics, en una película, muy desagradable para muchos; o en algunas apariciones, tanto en el seriado de Smallville, como en la Liga de la Justicia. En otros términos, Supergirl era un personaje secundario (y como decimos en Colombia, un personaje de relleno), dejándome bastante confundido y decepcionado. Por lo cual, decidí escribir estos fanfics bajo mi propia imaginación, para que en un futuro no lejano Supergirl tenga su propio programa, sea en dibujos animados (inclusive anime, bajo permiso de DC Comics), un seriado dramatizado o una película que valga la pena. PRIMER FANFIC: SUPERGIRL Y LA FUERZA ENERGÉTICA Es claro que este fanfic está basado de la película que fue realizada en 1983 y lanzada en 1984, producida por Alexander e Ilya Salkind y protagonizada por Helen Slater. No obstante, hay varios aspectos y situaciones que no están claras ni han sido relatadas en la película. Cabe aclarar que Supergirl fue creada por Mort Wersinger, Otto Binder y Al Plastino, para las historias de los números de Action Comics; actualmente, Supergirl es propiedad de DC Cómics. PRIMER CAPÍTULO: LA CASA DE EL EN KRIPTÓN. Todo empezó en el Planeta Kriptón, donde conocemos de las diferentes historias y relatos, sobre la difícil situación que sucedió a los habitantes de aquel planeta, antes de su destrucción. En primer lugar, algunos consideraban que Zor-El, hermano de Jor-El, era una persona malévola quien intentó realizar sus propios objetivos, sin el consentimiento de su hermano mayor; en ese mismo sentido, quería entablar una relación amorosa con Lara, esposa de su hermano. Sin embargo, toda esa versión no era cierta. Otros consideraban que Zor-El era una persona pacífica, de buenos sentimientos; un kriptoniano interesado en las decisiones de su hermano ante el Consejo Superior, para colaborar en sus trabajos y experimentos que eran benéficos para aquel planeta. Algunos decían que los integrantes de la Casa de El viajaron antes al Planeta Tierra, para analizar sobre la posible idea de traslado entre planetas, caso que era cierto. Aunque nunca tuvieron inconvenientes en ello, algunos habitantes de la Tierra vieron la aparición de una que otra nave en los cielos, de hecho, los kriptonianos tenían una tecnología avanzada para no ser detectados por la tecnología humana, rudimentaria de aquella época. Regresando a Kriptón, Jor-El se enteró de la rebelión del general Zod, quien quería provocar una guerra; decidió ir junto con los Guardianes Kriptonianos en dar captura, encarcelarlo y enviarlo a la Zona Fantasma. Al siguiente día, en la Casa de El, Zor-El estaba preocupado de lo que estaba investigando, avisó a su hermano, quien a su vez analizaba algunos asuntos. -Hermano, tenemos que hablar-. -Por ahora no tengo tiempo– respondió Jor-El caminando. -Es de suma importancia… es sobre nuestro planeta– insistió Zor-El. Jor-El no tuvo más remedio que escuchar a su hermano: -¿Es importante lo que me quieres decir?-. Zor-El lo llevó hacia la parte más profunda de la casa, indicó con el índice de su mano derecha el movimiento frecuente del suelo, causando grietas grandes que poco a poco comenzó en abrir, saliendo un líquido de masa incandescente. Al ver, Jor-Él lo presagió. -Tienes toda la razón, sabía que por diferentes causas que acontece en estos momentos, nuestro planeta tendrá el riesgo de chocar con el sol rojo dentro de poco tiempo- . -¿Cuáles causas?– Preguntó preocupado Zor-El. -Lo de Kriptón es algo que se podía corregir ante la rebelión de Zod, con su manipulación a los cristales…– manifestó Jor-El, quien a su vez confesó –no obstante, la otra razón es que alguien diferente a nosotros, a quien conozco, solamente por un simple deseo que tuvo en revivir a un ser amado bajo su propia magia, vulneró varias dimensiones del Universo y no puso caso de mi advertencia, ocasionando que el planeta Kriptón vaya en curso directo hacia el sol rojo y no en su curso habitual–. -No puede ser, ¿cuánto tiempo va a chocar nuestro planeta?– Insistió intranquilo Zor-El. -Creo que en pocos meses– respondió reflexivo Jor-El. -Entonces debemos que hacer algo de una vez, hay que evacuar a todos los kriptonianos y trasladarnos a un planeta seguro– aconsejó desesperado Zor-El. -Imposible… primero, porque no tenemos lo suficiente para evacuar a todos, y segundo, porque El Consejo Superior prohíbe esa operación– dudó Jor-El. -Pero hermano, eres consejero…– exhortó Zor-El –es importante que los convences sobre esta situación tan crítica que podría pasar, si no prevenimos, podíamos morir-. -Haré lo que esté a mi alcance en persuadir a todo el Consejo; si ellos no nos creen, trataremos de evacuar entre nosotros– Jor-El concluyó y marchó hacia el Consejo Superior. Mientras tanto, Allura, la esposa de Zor-El, avisó alarmada sobre otro acontecimiento. -¡Ya nacerá el niño!-. -Mi hermano se fue hacia el Consejo Superior– expresó impresionado Zor-El, sabiendo que Jor-El estaba pendiente del nacimiento del primogénito –lo único que podemos hacer es atender el parto de Lara– y ambos fueron en su auxilio. Mientras Jor-El expuso ante los miembros del Consejo Superior las razones del posible choque de Kriptón, el parto de Lara era complicado por las fuertes contracciones que sufría, no obstante nació el hijo sano. Por su lado el Consejo Superior, al escuchar los alegatos del ilustre kriptoniano, dio el dictamen negativo advirtiendo que si apelaba sobre ese asunto lo condenarían como traidor, con pena de presidio en la Zona Fantasma. Decepcionado y ensimismado, Jor-El regresó a casa, donde sus familiares lo recibieron felices por el nacimiento de su hijo, pero al verlo reservado, preguntaron sobre lo ocurrido. -El Consejo reprochó a mis argumentos sobre la destrucción de Kriptón, me advirtió que si apelamos sobre este asunto, nos encarcelarán; no hay nada de qué hacer…-. Zor-El, Allura y Lara se entristecieron, a pesar de eso, Zor-El obtuvo una idea: -Si el Consejo no quiere, nosotros iremos con nuestros amigos y vecinos-. -Imposible…– negó su familiar –si arriesgamos, nuestra familia quedará deshonrada por el Consejo-. -Hay que hacerlo, así sea a escondidas de ellos y sus Guardianes– Insistió su hermano. Cuando comenzó la fuerte discusión entre hermanos, el hijo de Lara empezó a llorar; Jor-El paró la discusión, vio al niño en los brazos de su amada y se calmó. -¿Este es nuestro hijo?– Curioseó Jor-El. -Sí Jor-El– reveló optimista Lara, entregando el bebé a los brazos de su ser querido, quien se contentó y lo alzó hacia arriba, haciendo que el bebé sonriera. -¿No crees que nuestro hijo yacería como otra víctima más de este posible desastre?– Insinuó Lara, Jor-El negó con la cabeza –entonces… vámonos todos-. Jor-El pensó otra vez y adquirió una idea. -Para no tener contrariedades, te propongo que vayas a la ciudad de Argos, allá debes escoger y fabricar grandes barreras de plomo resistentes, para encerrar toda la ciudad lo más pronto posible. Estoy seguro que con eso podrán resistir ante la explosión, aunque los efectos de la misma los llevarán hacia una dimensión diferente– sugirió Jor-El a su hermano. -Acepto tu propuesta– asintió Zor-El, surgiendo una duda -¿Nos acompañarán?-. -No…- la negativa de Jor-El dejó desalentado a su hermano. -¿Por qué?– Inquirió con voz alta Zor-El. -Tengo algo pensado para mi hijo… a quien lo llevaré hacia el Planeta Tierra– contestó Jor-El, dejando abrumada a Lara. -¿La Tierra?– ella indagó. -Así es…- respondió Jor-El, explicando –es hora de que nuestro hijo debe cumplir algo muy importante en ese planeta, para que allá no ocurra lo mismo que está ocurriendo a nuestro planeta; transmitiré toda la sabiduría en una nave, controlado por el poder de los cristales-. -Pero es imposible– reaccionó desconfiada Lara, quien exclamó -¡no podrá sobrevivir!-. -Lara, por favor…– Jor-El trató de sosegarla –nuestro hijo es la única esperanza para prevenir que los habitantes de La Tierra no cometan el mismo error de nosotros-. Después de la discusión, Zor-El y Allura se despidieron tristes de Jor-El y de Lara, luego marcharon hacia la ciudad de Argos, donde dialogaron con un conocido de la familia, su nombre era Zaltar. -¿Entonces su hermano quiere que esta ciudad sobreviva de la explosión?– preguntó investigando Zaltar. -Así es– respondió Zor-El. -Entonces no hay tiempo que perder, ayudaré en lo que vas hacer– expresó decidido Zaltar. Pasó el tiempo en la construcción de las barreras. Días antes de la explosión, Zor-El contactó a su hermano. -¿Han hecho lo que requerí? – Preguntó Jor-El. -Sí, nos falta algunos detalles de forzamiento de la ciudad, todos acá nos están colaborando y el Consejo de esta ciudad decidió apoyarnos– reconoció Zor-El. -Qué bueno por ustedes, estoy seguro que se salvarán; cuando mi hijo sepa que Argos City exista, los buscará y los ayudará, aunque será difícil para él– comentó prudente Jor-El. -Lo sé… hablando de ello, ¿pudiste construir la nave para Kal-El?– Cuestionó Zor-El. -Claro, a escondidas del Consejo Superior, concluiré la nave– contestó Jor-El. -¿Cuándo tiempo falta?– preguntó Zor-El -¿para que este planeta choque contra el sol?-. -Mañana…- reveló sereno Jor-El –solamente quiero comentar algo…-. -¿Cuál?– Preguntó Zor-El. -Cuando decidan tener un hijo, espero que en un tiempo lejano pueda conocer a Kal-El y compartir con él en La Tierra en la misión que él cumplirá cuando sean adultos, si lo hacen, protegerán a La Tierra, eso es lo único que quiero – expuso Jor-El. -Si eso es lo que quieres, se hará, nosotros estaremos siempre unidos, te aseguro hermano que no desfalleceremos en conocer a Kal-El cuando haya crecido– dijo Zor-El, añadiendo al final –Nunca olvidaré todo lo que hemos hecho y compartido-. -Hasta siempre… hermano– despidió Jor-El. Zor-El quedó triste, tomó un respiro, se tranquilizó y fue a terminar de fortalecer las barreras en la ciudad de Argos. Pasó un día, los kriptonianos de Argos City supieron sobre la destitución a Jor-El del cargo de consejero por parte del Consejo Superior, sin embargo, Jor-El y Lara metieron a Kal-El dentro de la nave para lanzarlo hacia el viaje. Minutos después, el planeta se acercó hacia las llamas del sol rojo, comenzando a tener constantes sismos y la subida del magma incandescente a la superficie; provocando un gran pánico a todos los kriptonianos. Los habitantes de Argos City se agacharon, con un semblante de miedo y temor reflejado en sus rostros. Todo estaba perdido, Kriptón explotó. Minutos después, la ciudad de Argos sufrió fuertes movimientos y grandes golpes en las barreras de protección, luego todo se calmó. Horas después Zaltar ordenó el retiro de las barreras, al retirarlas se abrió un campo de energía en los enormes arcos que rodearon a la ciudad, todos vieron la plena oscuridad que envolvía. -¿Dónde estamos?– preguntó Allura. -Estamos en una dimensión diferente– la respuesta de Zaltar dejó aturdidos a los sobrevivientes –creo que estamos en el Espacio Interior-. -¿Y ahora, qué haremos?– indagó una kriptoniana, mirando estremecida al lugar. -De ahora en adelante viviremos, no hay nada que temer en esta dimensión- indicó Zor-El, quien pidió a Zaltar -necesito que me entregue las fuerzas energéticas como son los cristales, la energía solar sustraída y el Omegahedron–. Mientras Zaltar entregaba a Zor-El las fuerzas energéticas para ponerlas en funcionamiento y dar vida a la ciudad, Allura avisó a Zor-El. -Quiero contarte algo-. -¿Te refieres a Kal-El?– Indagó Zor-El. -No es sobre él, es sobre nosotros– comentó Allura con disimulo. -¿Qué me quieres decir?– Preguntó Zor-El. -Tendré un hijo tuyo…– las palabras de Allura agradó a Zor-El, olvidando de todo lo que aconteció abrazando a su esposa, quien sugirió sonriente –no me aprietes tanto–. -¡Mi amor!, es la mejor noticia que he escuchado en toda mi vida– expresó alegre Zor-El –cuidaremos nuestro hijo con todo nuestro cariño, con él formaremos una nueva familia-.

SEGUNDO CAPÍTULO: GRAVE SITUACIÓN EN ARGOS CITY. El viaje del pequeño Kal-El era rápido, cuando llegó a la Tierra, el niño tenía 12 años de edad. En el Espacio Interior, el tiempo transcurrió lentamente. Durante el desarrollo del embarazo normal que tuvo Allura, sentía leves contracciones. Sin embargo un día, en plena reunión con los kriptonianos sobrevivientes, Allura sintió con gran dolor las siguientes contracciones, sus gemidos alertaron a todos los presentes. Zaltar y Zor-El ayudaron en el parto, llevando a Allura al otro sitio, donde ocurrió el nacimiento de una niña. -Es muy hermosa Allura– expresó alegre Zor-El. Zaltar cargó la niña en sus brazos y se lo dio a Allura, quien estaba acostada y cansada del parto; la pareja mostró inmensa alegría en sus rostros. Cuando miraron en el sistema para saber sobre la vida de Kal-El, cuando éste tenía 15 años, Allura sugirió a Zor-El: -Como es una niña se llamará Kara, ya que recordaremos siempre de Jor-El, de Lara y de Kal-El… Estoy segura que cuando crezca, será inteligente, sabia y con fuerza de voluntad para proteger a todos los seres queridos y tomar sus propias decisiones-. Zor-El alzó la niña y manifestó sonriente. -Así será. Hija mía, a ti te llamaremos Kara-. El tiempo pasó, se hicieron adecuaciones en el manejo del tiempo en Argos City para que sean similares al uso de horario de la Tierra. Las niñas y los niños de Argos City entraban a recibir enseñanza general y elemental. Kara era una de ellos, con 7 años de edad llegaba tarde a las enseñanzas en varias ocasiones, por ese motivo, tuvo un nivel de conocimiento bajo, de ahí que, siempre se distrae por cualquier cosa que miraba, más, si son cosas raras creadas por Zaltar para que se vea bien llamativa la ciudad. La maestra de trigonometría hexadimensional llamó la atención a Kara: -Kara, ¿por qué tienes que distraerte de nuevo? Me preocupa que llegues tarde– preguntó preocupada la maestra. -Perdón maestra, estoy sorprendida por las figuras y objetos que crea Zaltar– contestó apenada Kara. -Pero Kara, si sigues así, no podrás desarrollar tu capacidad intelectual ni desarrollarás tu madurez– advirtió la maestra. -No se preocupe maestra, me comprometo a ser más dedicada en mis conocimientos– Kara se comprometió. Horas después de terminada la enseñanza, Kara fue a ver a Zaltar, quien estaba creando una enorme escultura con una vara especial para crear objetos; ella como cualquier niña inocente, echó un vistazo y preguntó sorprendida. -¿Qué es lo que estás creando Zaltar?-. -¡Un árbol!– reveló exclamando Zaltar. -¿Un árbol? Muy raro…- comentó Kara, mirando la figura de arriba hacia abajo. -¿No sabes qué es un árbol?– cuestionó extrañado Zaltar. -No, ¿qué es?– contra preguntó Kara. -El árbol es un ser viviente del planeta Tierra, es parte de un reino natural denominado reino vegetal…- cuando Zaltar explicaba, a Kara le recordó algo. -Perdón Zaltar, pero ¿no es el mismo planeta en donde vive mi primo Kal-El?-. -¡Exacto!– expresó sonriente Zaltar. -Y… si el árbol es un ser viviente, ¿cómo va a estar viva acá?– la inquietud de la hermosa niña sirvió para que Zaltar mostrara el Omegahedron. Al verla Kara se inquietó, por lo tanto sabía qué era. -Zaltar, ¿cómo conseguiste el Omegahedron? ¿Acaso lo robaste a espalda de los Guardianes?-. -No, para nada, pedí prestado el Omegahedron a los Guardianes, solamente para cobrar vida a éste árbol– desmintió Zaltar. -¿Entonces el Omegahedron cobra vida a todo objeto?– siguió indagando Kara. -Bueno, esta fuerza energética no cobra vida a cualquier objeto, por eso todo es una ilusión– respondió Zaltar. Él tomó la vara, lo acercó cuidadosamente al Omegahedron y recibió suficiente energía en forma de esfera en el momento de resplandecer. -Para que inspire…- recitó concentrado Zaltar. Kara repitió la frase, viendo que Zaltar acercaba cuidadosamente la vara hacia la figura, del cual, destelló totalmente y cobró algo de vida. -Qué bello…- exclamó asombrada Kara, a quien le surgió otra cuestión: -¿Es difícil viajar hacia el Planeta Tierra?-. -¿No has aprendido de manera exacta sobre la trigonometría hexadimensional de los planetas y espacios?– Zaltar inquirió extrañado, Kara lo pensó y como no tenía idea, Zaltar explicó: -Mira, estamos en el Espacio Interior, el Planeta Tierra está en el Espacio Exterior, viajar desde cualquier planeta hacia la Tierra es de manera fácil y rápida, de ese modo, la distancia está medida en años-luz; sin embargo, desde el Espacio Interior es más complejo y difícil llegar hacia cualquier planeta, aunque, tengo algo que podrá funcionar en llegar a la Tierra-. -¿Cuál es?– curioseó Kara. -Es una nave, la llamaré cápsula binaria, sobre ella tengo varios análisis de diseño y formas de manejar; todos ellos registrados en una base de datos compiladas en uno de los cristales, solamente, me falta construir la nave y experimentar su velocidad y resistencia. Con ella, ¡podré llegar a la Tierra en menos tiempo que una nave en el espacio exterior!-. Cuando Zaltar continuaba explicando, Allura los distinguió acerándose hacia ellos, mientras, Kara continuaba con su inquietud. -Pero es riesgoso ir sin saber de lo que puede pasar-. -¡Con esta nave, llegaré como un rayo!– Alegó Zaltar –además, llegaré sano y salvo, no tendré inconvenientes-. -¿Y cómo podrás regresar hasta acá, desde allá…?– en el momento en que Kara preguntaba, Allura llamó a voz alta. -¡Kara! ¿Dónde estás?-. Kara se volteó y miró a su madre. -¡Aquí estoy, con Zaltar!– respondió Kara, levantando su mano. Allura se acercó hacia Kara, la abrazó e indagó con tierno tono. -¿Por dónde andabas hija?, pensé que regresarías temprano después de las clases-. -Tranquila Allura…- interrumpió Zaltar, mostrando su sonriente rostro – Kara está bien, conmigo, solamente vino por curiosear, ya que estoy mostrando milagros–. A la vez, pidió a Kara que mostrara su antebrazo izquierdo, ella lo hizo y con la vara, Zaltar creó una bonita pulsera de cristal en la muñeca de la mano izquierda; luego prestó la vara. -Tome firmemente la vara, apriétala y vaya creando sus propios objetos, que no sean tan grandes ¿eh?- indicó Zaltar. Al entregar la vara, Kara se alegró, presionó la vara y corrió hacia el rincón de la ciudad. -¡No te alejes y prueba tu propia imaginación, inténtalo!– solicitó Zaltar con voz alta. Cuando Kara estaba en aquel rincón, Allura habló con Zaltar. -¿Es cierto que tienes planeado salir de acá?-. -Si…- contestó Zaltar. -¿Por qué? Si bien sabes que nos ayudaste con la protección de esta ciudad, además, te ofrecieron para que formaras parte del Concejo – instó Allura. -Allura, soy un viajero de otros mundos, es difícil estar tanto tiempo sedentario; como cualquier ser, tengo mis propias decisiones, mis errores y mis problemas – confesó Zaltar. -Pero nosotros te reconocemos como un ser sabio y protector…-. Mientras Allura y Zaltar seguían conversando, Kara por su parte creó una figura muy rara, era un mosquito mediano y puntiagudo. Para que Allura no se enterara del Omegahedron, Zaltar metió de manera cuidadosa la fuerza energética por atrás, lo detuvo con su pie derecho y con el talón de aquel pie, lo golpeó para que rodara hacia el rincón, donde estaba Kara, sentada y concentrada en realizar su figura. Al terminar la figura, sintió que le llegaba un objeto esférico, se volteó y se asombró que era el Omegahedron; pensó en devolverlo a Zaltar, pero decidió usarlo para dar vida a su figura. Cogió la vara, la acercó lentamente al Omegahedron para que absorbiera algo de energía, luego aplicó a la figura, tocando sus alas. Poco a poco la figura cobró vida, moviendo sus alas para empezar a volar, dando varios giros alrededor de una Kara contenta, no obstante, esa alegría duró poco, de modo que el mosquito fue directamente hacia una de las múltiples ventanas-muro de la ciudad, como voló más rápido, chocó contra la ventana y la rompió. El choque ocasionó una fuerte succión de aire desde el Espacio Interior, alarmando a todos los habitantes de Argos City, entre ellos Allura y Zaltar, quienes asustados corrieron hacia Kara. -¡Kara, la fuerza energética!– el grito de Zaltar era tardío. El Omegahedron era succionado, pasando al Espacio Interior sin rumbo; Kara estaba asustada, como no se apoyó en algo, también fue succionada por el agujero. -¡Auxiliooo! ¡AAAHHH! ¡Ayúdameee!– gritó Kara, llorando amargamente, agarrando con dificultad en uno de los marcos del muro. Afortunadamente, Zor-El llegó a tiempo para socorrer a su hija del desperfecto y la llevó a los brazos de Allura; al mismo tiempo, Zaltar cogió la vara y reparó el daño. -¿Qué pasó Kara? ¿Estás bien?– examinó Allura, tranquilizando a su hija. -Madre… perdóname… cuando estaba creando mi figura, encontré el Omegahedron que estaba en el piso y lo usé para hacer volar; éste dio vueltas y de repente rompió el muro de vidrio…- expuso sollozando Kara. -¿Y el Omegahedron?– indagó preocupado Zor-El. -Desapareció, succionado hacia el Espacio Interior– reconoció resignado Zaltar. -No puedo creer que usted haya robado el Omegahedron– señaló enfurecido Zor-El. -El Omegahedron no lo robé, solo pedí prestado– alegó disgustado Zaltar. -¡AH!– profirió enérgico Zor-El – ¡Además de ladrón, mentiroso!-. -¡Basta!– interrumpió lloriqueando Kara –Por favor no peleen, yo tengo la culpa de usar el Omegahedron como una ignorante-. -¿Y ahora, qué va a pasar con la ciudad sin el Omegahedron?– preguntó Allura angustiada, teniendo a Kara en sus brazos. -Por ahora no pasará nada– indicó un poco sereno Zaltar – pero en los siguientes años, la ciudad perderá energía; cuando se agote, todos morirán– la oración dejó preocupados a todos los habitantes de Argos City. -¿Y cómo podemos encontrar el Omegahedron?– preguntó sollozando Kara. -Pequeña, la única forma es buscarlo en el Espacio Interior y tal vez en el Espacio Exterior– contestó Zaltar. -¡Imposible!– Interrumpió Zor-El –No podemos salir de esta ciudad, ¿cómo podrás encontrar y traer de regreso a esta ciudad?-. -Es posible que cuando tenga lista la cápsula binaria, podré buscar y encontrar el Omegahedron– propuso Zaltar –además, la pulsera que di a Kara será buena herramienta para detectarlo-. -En ese caso, usted no va a buscar el Omegahedron, porque estás arrestado– indicó Zor-El en tono seco. -Si es así– expresó Zaltar –entonces aceptaré mi arresto y mi prisión en la Zona Fantasma-. -No quiero que te vayas…- volvió a llorar Kara, Zaltar la tranquilizó. -No llores mi niña…– luego se dirigió a los demás –estoy seguro que ustedes van a sufrir dentro de algunos años, pero mi sufrimiento será de por vida a partir de este momento-. Los guardianes arrestaron a Zaltar y lo llevaron hacia un cuarto cerrado impenetrable. Al día siguiente, antes de ir a las enseñanzas, Kara caminó a donde estaba encerrado Zaltar. -Perdóname Zaltar…– dijo triste Kara –por lo que cometí–. -No es necesario que pidas perdón mi niña– respondió Zaltar en tono dulce – estoy seguro que la fuerza energética no está lejos, es posible que podría llegar al Planeta Tierra, solo espero que ningún ser vivo de aquel planeta lo toque, porque si lo hace, la maldad dominará sobre el juicio de aquel ser para dominar o destruir dicho planeta-. -Tengo que impedir– expresó resuelta Kara. -¿Cómo lo impedirás?– Cuestionó Zaltar –si aún eres una niña y no tienes la suficiente madurez ni la suficiente sabiduría de un adulto para tomar esa clase de decisión– Kara no sabía qué hacer, quería buscar el Omegahedron, a pesar de eso Zaltar tuvo razón. -Zaltar, te prometo que cuando madure y tenga sabiduría, buscaré y encontraré el Omegahedron, lo haré cueste lo que me cueste– prometió Kara. -Kara… - indicó cariñoso Zaltar – si quieres cumplir con lo que prometes, deberás cumplir, eso sí, tienes que cuidarte mucho cuando seas más grande. Si vas a La Tierra, experimentarás lo mismo que está experimentando tu primo, porque la densidad molecular de la atmósfera del sol amarillo te hará ser más fuerte, más rápida, podrás volar, tendrás grandes poderes usando todos tus sentidos, aunque deberás ser inteligente y responsable en tomar tus propias decisiones–. -¿Algún día volveré a verte?– preguntó Kara. -Quién sabe…- respondió pensativo Zaltar –pero estaré apoyándote en lo que harás, de todo corazón-. Esa fue la última vez que Kara habló con Zaltar en Argos City. Tiempo después Zaltar era llevado a la Zona Fantasma, donde permaneció el resto de su vida. El tiempo fue pasando, cuando Kara más crecía, más se hacía hermosa; era más inteligente, destacada entre los jóvenes de Argos City por sus conocimientos y por su dedicación; a pesar de que aún mostraba su distracción y torpeza, se sintió madura cuando cumplió sus 15 años. En eso entonces, Kal-El comenzó a trabajar como periodista, mostrando una falsa identidad como Clark Kent; sin embargo, cuando se convertía en superhéroe, era conocido por los humanos como Superman, realizando sus aventuras y hazañas para proteger a la humanidad y al planeta. Todos esos acontecimientos fueron vistos por Kara desde Argos City, quien estaba entusiasmada en querer conocer a su primo y compartir la misma misión que él hacía. En ese momento, la ciudad cada vez perdía más energía por consecuencia de la ausencia del Omegahedron, la situación era más grave de lo que todos se imaginaban. Por consiguiente, el Concejo convocó de carácter urgente una reunión para definir soluciones ante el grave problema que estaba pasando. Entre quienes asistieron a la reunión, estaban los padres de Kara. La discusión se hizo más tensa en aquella reunión, por el motivo que no llegaba a un acuerdo para dar medida a la situación. Zor-El estaba indeciso sobre la propuesta de la Cápsula Binaria, puesto que él mismo la construyó, siguiendo las instrucciones y parámetros de los datos que dejó Zaltar en el cristal, realizando pruebas de resistencia y de velocidad con la nave. -Zor-El– dijo Allura cuando él aún pensaba de esa posible solución –es mejor que expongas a todos, antes que ellos tomen la decisión sobre la ciudad-. Zor-El se mostraba indispuesto y pensativo, pero al echar un vistazo a una Allura sonriente para generar confianza, se armó de valor, pidió la palabra y se dirigió ante todo el Concejo. -Señores, sugiero que es momento de enviar a alguien de esta ciudad para buscar el Omegahedron, si esa fuerza energética está en la Tierra, tendremos que pedir ayuda a Kal-El para que nos ayude en la búsqueda-. -¿Se puede saber cómo vamos a enviar a uno de nosotros para allá?– interrogó sensato uno de los integrantes del Concejo. -En el proyecto que dejó Zaltar, saqué los datos para construir una nave, con ella hice experimentos y soy optimista que funcionará– la respuesta de Zor-El generó gran discusión en todo el Concejo. -Pero usted decía que es difícil salir de esta ciudad– debatió otro de los concejeros. -Analizando sobre la nave, es posible realizar el viaje– confesó seguro Zor-El. -Si es así como planteas, ¿quién va a ir en ella? ¿Usted Zor-El? – puso en tela de juicio otro integrante del Concejo. -Zor-El no va, pero sí nuestra hija Kara– impugnó Allura, evitando a lo que iba expresar Zor-El. -¿Cómo vas a sugerir a nuestra hija?– inquirió extrañado Zor-El a Allura. -Porque ella me confesó que prometió a Zaltar en buscar el Omegahedron, está totalmente dispuesta y tiene suficiente madurez para asumir esta responsabilidad– apuntó austeramente Allura. -¿Es cierto lo que insinúa, Zor-El?– preguntó otro de los concejeros, Zor-El discutió en voz baja con Allura. -Si sugieres a nuestra hija, no podrá solucionar con esto-. -Confía en mí, estoy segura que todo saldrá bien– alegó Allura con tranquilidad. Zor-El dio un gesto de aceptación ante todo el Concejo, ellos comenzaron en analizar la propuesta y al terminar deliberaron. -Zor-El, su idea será aceptada, siempre y cuando su hija se entere y tome la decisión ante esta misión, si es así, prepare y condicione la nave para que ella viaja–. De inmediato, Allura salió corriendo a donde estaba Kara, quien veía en uno de los vidrios de cristal lo que hacía Kal-El en la Tierra. -Kara, es importante que me acompañes– avisó Allura. -¿Para qué madre?– indagó Kara. -Para que tomes una decisión, del cual has querido prometer– indicó Allura. Kara aceptó y fue con Allura directamente al Concejo; allá se encontró con Zor-El para que los tres caminaron al centro de la reunión. -Kara, un paso al frente– Kara obedeció y avanzó -¿aceptarás cumplir con la misión de encontrar el Omegahedron y traerlo de vuelta a Argos City?-. Kara miró a sus padres, quienes se entrelazaron sus manos para mostrar confianza, luego tomó un respiro y respondió de frente. -Acepto la misión-. -Entonces su misión empieza ahora, vaya a la nave que construyó su padre, el futuro de nuestra ciudad está en sus manos-. Tras la decisión unánime del Concejo, Kara tomó otro respiro, se dirigió a sus padres y los abrazó. -Gracias por confiarme, no los decepcionaré y regresaré lo más pronto posible con el Omegahedron hasta acá– agradeció Kara de manera alegre. -Kara– aconsejó Zor-El –la pulsera que traes te servirá para sentir la energía del Omegahedron, además, con esa misma pulsera podrás comunicar con nosotros desde cualquier lugar, nosotros estaremos pendientes de ti– y la abrazó, luego Kara abrazó a su madre. -Hija, sé que es muy difícil dejarnos a tu temprana edad, pero estoy segura que conseguirás lo que has prometido a Zaltar– dijo Allura con algo de melancolía en su rostro. -Tranquila madre– expresó Kara – estaré bien, me cuidaré y regresaré pronto-. Después de abrazarlos Kara caminó hacia la nave donde se acomodó, la nave se cerró automáticamente y en seguida despegó. Sus padres la siguieron caminando a pasos rápidos, al verlos la chica se despidió con su mano derecha y con una bella sonrisa en sus labios. -¡Kara, no te olvides de nosotros!– Gritó Allura; la nave salió de la ciudad sin inconvenientes –espero que regreses– continuó Allura, quien al lado de Zor-El, caminaron de nuevo al Concejo. Kara miró desde la nave si aparecía el Omegahedron, aunque recordó algo: \"Lástima que no avisé que mi primo se fue del Planeta Tierra para una misión hacia otros planetas, a pesar de eso, cumpliré sola en esta misión\". Revisó su pulsera para sentir la presencia del Omegahedron y cuando lo sintió, dirigió la nave más allá del Espacio Interior. Escrito inicialmente el domingo, 3 de enero de 2010.

Se preguntarán ¿a dónde llegó el Omegahedron? Pues bien, hace algunos años el Omegahedron llegó a la Tierra, tal como pronosticó Zaltar. En uno de los parques naturales cerca de Smallville, una pareja de jóvenes universitarios acamparon a orillas de un río, desde allí realizaron silenciosamente sus lecturas de obras literarias, compartiendo experiencias. Ambos querían saber más allá de la vida existente. Cuando la universitaria leía, su novio la contemplaba. -¿Por qué no experimentamos como el resto de los jóvenes?– curioseó el joven. -Porque no quiero tener esa clase de locuras en rumbas, cantar canciones de rock, o burlar de las tonterías que hacen los profesores; por lo tanto, esas locuras no van conmigo– refutó la señorita, concentrada en su lectura –siempre me ha gustado la magia, los mitos, las leyendas y todo lo oculto-. -Pero Selena, por lo menos podemos disfrutar igual que ellos– sugirió el joven juguetón, sacando lentamente las llaves del automóvil, puesto que ella era la propietaria de dicho auto -¿por qué no jugamos algo, por ejemplo, buscar algún objeto?-. -Por favor Nigel– objetó Selena –yo no tengo ganas de jugar, además, debemos que preparar para el examen de mañana en la universidad-. Cuando Nigel quería matar el tiempo con Selena, ambos vieron que algo salió de las aguas del río, como si fuera una bala, provocando a que ambos salieran corriendo. Un objeto esférico y brillante cayó en uno de los platos de comida. Al ver lo que estaba cayendo, Selena se fascinó. -¿Qué es eso?– curiosa, la chica cogió el objeto esférico, comenzando a resplandecer en frente de ella. Selena se quedó maravillada, ella y Nigel no dijeron ni una sola palabra en 5 minutos, en ese momento, Selena sintió que algo fuerte la atraía desde su alma, mientras que Nigel la contemplaba. -¿No crees que esta extraña esfera tiene un poder oculto de magia?– indagó Nigel, pero Selena no reaccionaba, empezando en preocupar al joven acompañante –Selena, ¿me estás escuchando?-. -Claro que te escucho– contestó Selena, quien agregó –pero, ¿no ves? Esto me va ayudar mucho en lo que siempre he querido experimentar– la ávida contestación de Selena aumentó más la preocupación de Nigel. -Si quieres, nos vamos de una vez – aconsejó Nigel de manera pícara, sin que Selena lo supiera. Ella aceptó, ambos recogieron sus cosas y la joven entró al auto; influenciada por la brillante esfera, cerró la puerta olvidando de Nigel, quien aprovechó para realizar su juego, acercando a la ventana del auto. -¿Se te olvidó algo?– preguntó travieso Nigel. -No… no encuentro las llaves del auto– alegó Selena, buscando entre sus objetos personales. -Te sugiero que si no me das ese objeto extraño que tienes, no te daré las llaves– Esa frase hizo enojar a Selena, quien se calmó cuando tocó a la esfera. Al acercar la esfera hacia el timón, Selena se maravilló cuando el auto comenzó a encender por sí solo, dejando callado a Nigel, a quien no lo despidió. -¡Selena, no te vayas!– gritó Nigel, extrañado por el raro comportamiento de la joven. Por la noche, Selena llegó a su casa llevando consigo la esfera, en ese momento, su aspecto juvenil se transformó al de una mujer madura en un instante. Sin avisar a sus padres, se encerró en su alcoba para comenzar en hacer hechizos a escondidas. Al paso del tiempo, los familiares de Selena se sorprendieron cada vez más por la actitud tan cambiante de la joven, quien día tras día empezó a planear sus asuntos: para conseguir riquezas, o para querer dominar el mundo; aunque, consideraron que estaba haciendo locuras sin sentido. -Algún día… todas y todos pagarán por lo que me han hecho sentir– pronunció en voz baja Selena desde su alcoba, acariciando a la esfera. Años después, Nigel era profesor de matemáticas del Colegio Femenino, asimismo, era hechicero a disimuladas para que nadie se enterara; de igual manera, fue a una lujosa casa donde estaba viviendo Selena, quien a su vez, compartía con su amiga Bianca las pruebas de hechicería, teniendo amplios conocimientos en las ciencias y las artes ocultas. Ahora, quiero referir a otros personajes que están en esta historia, me refiero a Lois Lein y a Jimmy Olsen, quienes trabajaban en The Daily Planet con Clark Kent (es decir, Superman). Clark tuvo que ir, con el pretexto de realizar un reportaje en África, sin que nadie supiera la verdad en que Superman iba en una misión, que consiste en ir a los demás planetas, llevando un mensaje de paz de parte de los habitantes de la Tierra. Lois realizaba su reportaje sobre la crisis económica que afrontaba Estados Unidos, mientras Jimmy quería ir de nuevo a Smallville, puesto que, la secretaria del director pidió que recogiera algunos objetos personales que dejó en aquel pueblo, además de reclamar algunas fotos que dejó olvidado Clark en la granja de los Kent, sobre la celebración de los ex compañeros de preparatoria. Cuando Jimmy se preparaba para ir, habló con Lois. -Lois, necesito hablar contigo– avisó Jimmy. -Dime Jimmy– respondió Lois, quien escribía un artículo. -Iré de nuevo a Smallville, pero me gustaría avisar a su hermana Lucy, para poder visitarla – sugirió Jimmy. -¿De nuevo quieres estar con mi hermana?– dudó Lois, un poco enojada. -Si…- contestó sonrojado Jimmy. -Mire señor Casanova– señaló sarcástica Lois, observando a los ojos del joven -recuerda que eres muy joven para conquistar a chicas de la edad de mi hermana. Si lo vas hacer, yo te mato y no lo digo en sentido figurado-. -Tranquila Lois– Jimmy expresó con temor –yo no haré ningún daño a Lucy, al contrario, la cuidaré como alguien más de la familia-. -Más te vale Jimmy…- advirtió Lois, dando la bocina del teléfono –avise de una vez, en estos momentos Lucy está en pleno almuerzo en el colegio-. Jimmy llamó y habló con Lucy, la conversación fue corta y amena, después colgó el teléfono. -¿Qué te dijo Lucy?– inquirió Lois, escribiendo en su computador. -Que estará pendiente de mi llegada– manifestó sonriente Jimmy. -Pues te deseo buena suerte… ¡ah!– exclamó Lois. -Sí, que tengo que cuidar de Lucy…- comentó un poco molesto Jimmy. -No es eso…- negó Lois -¿supiste algo sobre Clark en África?-. -La verdad, no…– respondió Jimmy –yo creo que se va a demorar, ya sabes que a Clark no le gusta que lo llamemos cuando está de viaje-. -Verdad… Ese Clark sí que sale con sus cosas… Bueno Jimmy, cuide bien de Lucy, pero eso sí, cuidadito en tener relaciones más allá de ser amigos– advirtió Lois. Jimmy lo tuvo en cuenta, despidió de Lois y se fue de viaje a Smallville. Al fondo del Planeta Tierra, en las profundidades de las aguas venía la nave donde estaba Kara, quien revisaba la presencia del Omegahedron con su pulsera, sin embargo, vio algo luminoso en el fondo oscuro del profundo mar, sintiendo algo extraño con sus sentidos al percibir poco a poco los rayos del sol. Cerró un momento sus ojos, más tarde los levantó, conociendo impresionada que su vestido plateado se convirtió en un traje similar al de portaba su primo. Cada vez que la nave se acercaba más rápido, se abrió automáticamente desde las aguas; en ese instante, Kara miró arriba, levantó lentamente sus brazos y saltó desde la nave con gran rapidez, saliendo de las aguas; percatando el aire puro del lugar de los bosques, el mismo lugar que, algunos años atrás, Selena y Nigel notaron sobre el Omegahedron. Como Kara no sabía usar sus grandes poderes, cayó mareada al suelo. Minutos después, notó todo alrededor cuando se levantó. Alzó su cabello rubio, observó el piso, cogió una roca para tocarla, rompiendo fácilmente con su mano derecha. En seguida, sacó una flor con los pétalos cerrados, fijó su mirada en ella emitiendo rayos de calor de sus ojos para abrirla cuidadosamente. La hermosa kriptoniana dio media vuelta, acercó la flor con su nariz, respiró profundamente sin saber que se elevaba. Sonriente, dejó sus preocupaciones de lado, brincando de piedra en piedra, haciendo piruetas en el aire, contrastando con los inmensos árboles del bosque. Más adelante, descendió su vuelo hacia el río para tocar el agua con su mano izquierda, arrancando su alegre vuelo, cada vez más alto para recorrer montañas, cascadas y praderas. Estaba feliz apreciando los vientos de las nubes, de la misma forma, abrió sus brazos emulando el vuelo de un ave. Pero al sentir la adrenalina y sus poderes, Kara se olvidó de su misión, recorriendo por el ancho mar hacia el otro lado. Llegando como un avión a las costas arenosas, vio de lejos una cordillera de montañas, nevados, árboles y animales diferentes; miró casas rudimentarias, pequeños pueblos y ciudades. Al pasar por la sabana al lado de las playas, decidió bajar pisando en un camino polvoriento, miró que todo era distinto y caminó en ello. Recordando su misión, revisó su pulsera para sentir la energía del Omegahedron, a pesar de eso, el resultado fue negativo. Voló de nuevo buscando un lugar para saber dónde estaba, encontrando un pueblo pequeño donde se detuvo en medio de la calle principal, contemplando que estaba desolado. Quería preguntar a alguien, aun cuando no había respuesta. Cuando quería reiniciar su vuelo para seguir buscando, escuchó el llamado de una niña. -¡Hey! ¡Espera!-. Kara miró de nuevo a ambos lados y encontró a una niña de rasgos trigueños. -¿Quiero saber cómo te llamas?– preguntó la niña, Kara se impresionó cuando le hablaba en un idioma diferente, aunque podía entenderla. -Me llamo Kara– respondió la joven, arrodillándose para ver a la niña -¿y tú cómo te llamas?–. -Tania– contestó la niña. -Tania… ¿tú sabes cómo se llama este pueblo?– preguntó cariñosa Kara. -Se llama El Salado– indicó Tania, un poco nerviosa. -¿Conoces una ciudad que se llama Metrópolis?– preguntó Kara. -La verdad… no la conozco, es la primera vez que escucho ese nombre– negó Tania. Kara no sabía qué hacer, se mostraba perdida, de repente una señora gritó atemorizada a Tania. ¡Tania! ¡Ven para acá! – el grito hizo reaccionar a la niña. Tania corrió a donde estaba la señora, dejando extrañada a Kara quien examinaba a los habitantes del pueblo, refugiados en sus casas, temerosos que les podría ocurrir algo malo. La niña llegó a donde estaba la señora. -¿Qué haces afuera?– cuestionó enojada la señora -¿No te das cuenta que es peligroso hablar con extraños?-. -Si mamá, pero ella está buscando una ciudad– cuando Tania confesaba, su madre avisó al resto de los lugareños a que salieran. La mayoría salieron pavorosos, algunos sacaron palos y machetes. Al verlos, Kara no entendía lo que estaba sucediendo. -Disculpa, me encuentro perdida, quiero saber ¿dónde queda la ciudad de Metrópolis?– los habitantes del pueblo no quisieron responder, pensaban que era un engaño para matarlos. Como no obtuvo ninguna respuesta, Kara suplicó: -Es cierto que tienen temor, pero vengo tranquilamente en son de paz-. -Si es así señorita, ¿por qué no regresa de donde vino? – discutió uno de los habitantes. -Porque no sé en dónde estoy– reveló sincera Kara. -¿Has venido de los grupos armados para masacrarnos?– interrogó otro habitante. -Para nada– manifestó atónita Kara – ¿a cuáles grupos se refieren? No entiendo-. -Nos referimos a los paracos, guerrilleros, narcos, militares y policías– explicó la madre de Tania –además, tememos que usted sea una de ellos– todos estuvieron de acuerdo y comenzaron a protestar. Como Kara no encontró respuesta de ellos, no tuvo más remedio que reiniciar su vuelo buscando otro lugar, sin embargo, un grupo de niños y jóvenes corrieron y gritaron. -¡No te vayas!– Al escucharlos, los adultos se enfurecieron y les increparon, advirtiendo cualquier clase de castigos. Kara aún estaba confundida. -¿Tienes el mismo traje de Superman?– indagó un joven. -Si…- contestó Kara. -¿Y tienes los mismos poderes que él posee? – insistió el mismo joven. -Así es– la afirmación de Kara generó gran sorpresa a los niños y a los jóvenes; ella preguntó al joven: -¿Cómo te llamas?-. -Edwin, un ferviente admirador de Superman, me gustaría que él viniera para acá a defendernos de esos delincuentes-. -Te confieso que soy prima de él– al momento de reconocer Kara, los niños se maravillaron pero a los adultos les irritaron más. -¡Esa señorita está loca! ¿Acaso quiere burlarse de nosotros? – vociferaron algunos de los habitantes. -Sé que ustedes no tienen confianza en nadie, pero por lo menos créame, porque lo que digo es la verdad– alegó serena Kara. No obstante, los habitantes se alarmaron cuando escucharon la llegada de siete camperos modernos, en cada campero venían varios hombres armados. -¡Son los paracos! ¡Escóndanse todos!– el grito de uno de los jóvenes hizo correr desesperadamente a todos los habitantes a esconder en sus casas. La señora sacó a Tania en sus brazos y Edwin quedó al lado de una Kara involucrada. Los hombres que venían camuflados de militares de manera vulgar se pillaron en ver a la bella joven rubia y al joven en medio de la calle. -Vaya, vaya… ¿Qué tenemos ahí? ¿Una turista disfrazada de Superman en este pueblito?– curioseó el comandante de aquel grupo, fumando tranquilamente un cigarro. -¿Puedo saber señorita el motivo de su valiosa visita en este feo y arruinado lugar?-. -¡Puede ser feo y arruinado, pero ustedes son unos lobos hambrientos de poder!– gritó Edwin. -Deje de lamentar chiquillo, ¿O quieres que te reclute en nuestro glorioso grupo de valientes? – insinuó burlón el comandante. -No es bueno que convenzas de esa manera al joven– indicó Kara al comandante. -Bien, bien, hablas en nuestro idioma– sonrió el comandante, preguntando sensualmente: -¿Por qué no te unes y te diviertas con nosotros? Puedo darte grandes lujos y riquezas-. -Me da pena con usted, pero vine en una misión, en el cual su grupo no podrá ayudarme– rehusó Kara, añadiendo – ¿Por qué no entrega sus riquezas a los habitantes de este pueblo?-. -¡AAAAHHH! ¿Con qué no te gustó mi oferta?– Exclamó disgustado el comandante –Si no quieres aceptar mi propuesta a las buenas, entonces te convenceré a las malas– a su vez llamó a tres de sus hombres para que la atrapara. Ellos bajaron del campero sin llevar armas para caminar a donde estaba la joven, pero Edwin se interpuso en medio para interrumpir el paso, a pesar de eso, ellos lo golpearon tirando al suelo, en seguida, se acercaron hacia la joven enfurecida y la rodearon. -Señorita, no queremos hacerte daño– apuntó uno de los hombres. El trío caminó lentamente alrededor de ella, con un apetito de acoso. -Dígame la verdad, ¿ustedes quiénes son?– inquirió Kara, observando a cada uno. -Somos integrantes del cuerpo de las Autodefensas, si quieres, puedes formar parte de nosotros– reveló el segundo hombre, mirando de pies a cabeza a la chica. -No me interesa formar parte de ustedes– rechazó Kara en forma tajante. -¿En serio? Entonces aténgase a las consecuencias–. Al momento de decir, el tercer hombre se acercó lentamente para tocarla y besarla; sin embargo, ella cogió el rostro de aquel hombre con su mano derecha y lo apretó, causando lesión con gemidos de dolor, después lo lanzó tumbando de una vez al segundo compañero. Todos se quedaron anonadados, los niños comenzaron en aclamar. El primer hombre, al ver temeroso a sus compañeros caídos, sacó una navaja de su pantalón, acercó a Kara con cuidado; pero ella al ver la navaja, emitió rayos de calor de sus ojos hacia el arma, causando un fuerte ardor en la mano derecha de aquel hombre quien dejó caer la navaja, éste reaccionó atacando a donde estaba Kara para matarla, al contrario ella reaccionó, pateando con su pie derecho al rostro de aquel hombre, lanzando por encima de los demás compañeros inconscientes. Enardecido, el comandante tiró su cigarro al piso, ordenando a sus hombres. -¡Abran fuego!–. Tras ver a los 200 hombres alistando sus ametralladoras, Kara se alarmó por Edwin quien estaba en el piso inconsciente; al momento que ellos dispararon, corrió con una extraordinaria velocidad para sacar a Edwin del suelo y en milésimas de segundo lo llevó a donde estaban escondidos los habitantes. -Cuidan al joven, por favor– los habitantes comenzaron en confiar en Kara, quien fue de frente a los hombres armados. Los camuflados dispararon con sus armas, pero las balas no afectaron a Kara, quien tranquilamente cruzó sus brazos. -¿Eso es todo lo que tienen?– provocó Kara a los hombres armados. Los tiroteos se hicieron más frecuentes hacia la chica, lanzaron granadas y dispararon morteros, a pesar de todo, Kara seguía tranquila. Al disparar una bala del mortero, ella cogió con su mano izquierda con agilidad, luego dobló con sus manos y botó por un lado. Era el turno de la kriptoniana, quien dio un gran soplo formando un fuerte remolino, del cual dejó volando a la mayoría de los hombres; en seguida dio grandes saltos, golpeando a todos en forma de artes marciales con bastante velocidad, dejando en pie al comandante inmóvil, sin saber qué hacer viendo a sus hombres tirados en el piso, más adelante vio de frente a Kara, quien lo alzó arriba con su mano derecha. -¿Qué vas hacer?- interrogó Kara – ¿Dejarás vivir tranquilas a todas estas personas?– el comandante aceptó la sugerencia. Kara tiró al comandante, al mismo tiempo, con una larga cuerda que estaba en uno de los camperos, amarró a todos los hombres en círculos con una asombrosa agilidad, atando al final en uno de los grandes camperos para colocarlos todos dentro de él. Los habitantes se alegraron, por eso, entre llantos y aplausos gritaron con júbilo el acto heroico de Kara, los niños y los jóvenes corrieron para abrazarla, quien los recibió con una sonrisa en su rostro. -Gracias Kara– agradeció Tania. -Qué bueno que formas parte de la familia de Superman– expresó emocionado Edwin. -Gracias por sus mensajes, pero ahora tengo que llevar a estos delincuentes ante las autoridades– indicó Kara, quien preguntó a los habitantes: -¿Dónde habrá un puesto militar más cercano?-. -Está a unos 30 kilómetros al nororiente de este pueblo – respondió uno de los habitantes. Cuando Kara estaba lista para llevar a los hombres, Tania interrumpió. -¿Qué pasará con nosotros?-. -Tranquila Tania, convenceré para que ayuden al pueblo– reveló Kara, añadiendo a los demás: –Vendré pronto con una respuesta, confíen en mí– dicho eso, Kara alzó el campero con sus manos y lo llevó volando rumbo al batallón. No muy lejos del pueblo, en un batallón militar, uno de los soldados vio sorprendido que llegaba de los cielos un campero, llevado por una persona quien volaba. -Un momento, ¿ese quien viene no es Superman…?– Sobó sus ojos y tomó los binoculares para ver más claro: –no es él, es una chica con un traje idéntico, voy avisar a mi capitán-. El soldado circuló y avisó al capitán, quien al escuchar, lo tomó como una broma. -Por favor soldado, ¿estás alucinando?– preguntó el capitán. -Es cierto mi capitán, si quieres, compruebe usted mismo– contestó nervioso el soldado. -Bueno, voy a ver, pero si no es cierto, de castigo tienes que hacer 100 flexiones de pecho y dar 10 vueltas alrededor de la cancha– advirtió el capitán, quien con otros cinco soldados se acercaron a la ventana y se impactaron en ver a la chica quien volaba, llevando el campero. Kara, al ver la base, aterrizó en la mitad de la cancha, dejando el campero lleno de los 200 hombres amarrados. -No lo puedo creer…- se asombró el capitán, quien corrió junto con los soldados hacia la cancha en donde estaba Kara. Todos se maravillaron al ver a la hermosa chica, quien demostraba los mismos poderes de Superman. -Disculpe, ¿Quién está al mando de este batallón?– indagó Kara. Todos se quedaron estáticos y mudos, la joven insistió. -Es importante, porque capturé a estos 200 hombres, quienes dicen ser de las Autodefensas, con ellos está el comandante quien lideraba– ante las palabras de Kara, el capitán caminó al campero y reconoció los rostros. -Pero si éstos son los que estábamos buscando, ellos tienen orden de captura por narcotráfico, homicidio y secuestro– en seguida, el capitán se volteó y miró a Kara – ¿usted misma acabó con este gran número de hombres?– Kara respondió acertadamente con su rostro. -Los encontré cuando atacaron a un pueblo que se llama El Salado– manifestó Kara, no obstante, el capitán dudó. -Pero nosotros patrullamos ese pueblo y lo encontramos vacío-. -Se equivoca capitán– negó Kara –los habitantes de aquel pueblo han perdido la confianza en ustedes– y añadió –es importante que vayan a ese pueblo, porque ellos necesitan ayuda médica, alimentaria y presencia de seguridad de manera urgente-. El capitán ordenó a sus soldados para que llevaran a los malhechores, al mismo tiempo, pidió a Kara que se quedara un momento y fue a una cabina de telecomunicaciones para hablar con el comando central del ejército. Después de contactar, fue a donde estaba Kara. -Señorita, lo que nos solicitas es urgente, por ende, me dieron la orden para que enviemos ayuda humanitaria de inmediato, de hecho, tendremos nuestro personal listo para ir al pueblo-. Más tarde, el personal médico y militar se montó en los cuatro helicópteros, los demás se quedaron en el batallón, haciendo una despedida con gesto militar a Kara, quien emprendió su vuelo, agradeciendo con el mismo gesto militar y guió a los helicópteros rumbo al pueblo. Dos horas después, los niños divisaron la llegada de Kara, acompañada de los helicópteros que venían, los niños se alegraron y avisaron a todos los habitantes del pueblo: -¡Allí viene Superchica!-. Todos los habitantes salieron a las calles, vieron a Kara saludando y se alegraron; mientras ella aterrizaba, haciendo señas a los helicópteros para que descendieran de manera segura en el pueblo. Los militares bajaron, llevando alimentos; lo mismo hicieron los médicos para realizar atención hospitalaria, posteriormente, inspeccionaron el pueblo y trataron bien a los habitantes. Tania y Edwin se acercaron alegres hacia Kara. -No sé cómo agradecerte amiga– dijo Tania –definitivamente si cumpliste con la promesa-. -Y lo hice Tania– reconoció Kara –espero que con esto sirva al pueblo para que tenga confianza en las autoridades-. -Gracias Kara, o deberé llamarte Superchica– expresó Edwin, dejando impresionada a Kara –porque nos salvaste del abandono y del miedo-. -¿Cómo me dijiste? ¿Superchica?– preguntó sonriente Kara. -Sí y no me arrepentiré de lo que te llamé– al momento en que Edwin revelaba, Kara abrazó con cariño a ambos niños en forma de agradecimiento, a continuación, fue a donde estaban todos los habitantes, militares y médicos: -Es importante decirles que prometí y cumplí, pero tengo una misión importante del cual vine, por eso debo ir, pero nunca los olvidaré– al decir, todos aplaudieron a Kara, a quien le surgió un interrogante: -Ahora quiero saber, ¿dónde queda la ciudad de Metrópolis?-. -Metrópolis queda en los Estados Unidos, al norte de este pueblo, pasando por el Mar Caribe– indicó el capitán, a quien se le ocurrió regalar a Kara una brújula: -con esta brújula, podrás encontrar el norte en la dirección de la flecha, espero que la uses bien para que puedas ir a todos los lugares de la Tierra-. Kara aceptó, lo cogió y al momento de elevar, se volteó y con su mano derecha, se despidió de todos. -¡Gracias a todos!–. -¡Gracias Superchica!– expresaron todos los habitantes. -¡Espero que nos encontramos algún día no lejano Kara!– gritó Tania. Kara consintió con una sonrisa en sus labios, emprendiendo su vuelo al norte, viendo la brújula para orientarse. Ella salió del pueblo denominado El Salado, ubicado en el norte de Colombia; pasando por el Mar Caribe con velocidad supersónica rumbo a los Estados Unidos. Llegando las primeras horas de la noche, Kara llegó a los Estados Unidos, averiguó con su pulsera, sintiendo poco a poco la energía del Omegahedron, en seguida, fue hacia la ciudad de Metrópolis, en donde se sorprendió de ver la cantidad de luces y de grandes rascacielos. Como no pudo sentir la energía del Omegahedron, llegó en un bosque a fueras de Metrópolis, para descansar de su búsqueda por la fuerza energética.

Esa misma noche, en una lujosa casa a fueras de Smallville, se realizó una fiesta de disfraces cuya anfitriona era Selena, quien al lado de su amiga Bianca, estaban mostrando su hospitalidad en aquella fiesta. En ese momento, uno de los asistentes era Nigel quien charlaba con varios de los invitados, de repente, se tropezó con una jovencita de anteojos. -¿Se encuentra bien señorita?– preguntó Nigel. -Sí, estoy bien– tras responder, la señorita vio a Nigel y recordó sorprendida - ¿No eres aquel profesor de matemáticas y de sistemas en el Colegio Femenino? -. Nigel miró fijamente a la señorita y se acordó: -¡Ahh! Claro que me acuerdo, pero dígame señorita Spencer, ¿por qué estás en esta fiesta? ¿Estás averiguando sobre lo que hago cuando no soy profesor?-. -La verdad no…– contestó la joven – pero siempre admiro su curiosidad y forma de ser-. -A ver, se supone que debería estar en casa, estudiando o descansando, no en asistir a esta clase de fiestas– advirtió Nigel. -Lo que pasa es que quiero manifestar algo…- en ese mismo momento de confesión de la joven, apareció Selena portando un hermoso vestido azulado, de ahí que, quería ser el centro de atracción. Al ver a Nigel y a la jovencita se amargó, pidió un plato de pasabocas a Bianca y fue hacia ellos, interrumpiendo. -No puedo creer que viniera una curiosa en nuestro evento, aun cuando me acordara si la invité o no–. -Selena…- la señorita reveló con temor –solo quería reportar un artículo para el periódico escolar-. -Lástima… esto no es para jovencitas– dijo despótica Selena, incomodando a la señorita. -Por lo menos, la señorita quería hablar algo importante conmigo– aclaró Nigel. -Nigel– alegó Selena – si quieres hablar con tu estudiante, ¿por qué no lo hacen en clases o en descansos? Porque aquí no se puede– luego se dirigió a la señorita –Si quieres estar en esta fiesta, tienes que ser mayor de edad, de tal manera que, te invito a que salgas de mi casa-. Dicho eso, la señorita sollozó, saliendo de la casa de Selena, dejando disgustado a Nigel. -Selena– el hombre agarró el brazo derecho y la llevó hacia el pasillo –es increíble que te vuelves a ser más soberbia y egocéntrica, no eres la misma desde que cogiste esa rara esfera-. -Nigel, mi amor…– expresó Selena acariciando las mejillas a Nigel –soy la misma, pero más madura y con total capacidad para manejar los poderes ocultos, gracias a esa esfera-. -Por eso…– instó Nigel –debes que ser más comprensiva y entendible con los demás-. -No necesito de tus consejos– refutó Selena –quien verdaderamente me aconseja es Bianca y tú cada vez te vuelves más cansón-. Disgustado Nigel quiso retirar, no obstante advirtió. -Si encuentro sobre el origen y uso de la esfera, te la quitaré- dicho ello, Nigel salió irritado de la casa de Selena. Horas después de terminado el evento, Selena habló con Bianca en la sala. -Es hora de definir nuestro plan…– dijo Bianca –sabemos que Superman marchó al Universo, es el momento de comenzar con lo que quieres-. -Es cierto– recordó Selena –debemos empezar con el control de mentes a los policías y autoridades del pueblo–. -¿Cómo?- inquirió Bianca. -Sencillo, cuando tengamos lista la poción para borrar las mentes, necesitamos un voluntario– explicó Selena. -¿Cómo lo conseguiremos?– indagó Bianca. -¿Te acuerdas del Colegio Femenino?– contra preguntó Selena. -Claro…– resonó Bianca –allá fui estudiante, actualmente Nigel está como profesor-. -Llegaremos mañana por la tarde, allá estaremos notando a quién lo podemos convencer- expuso Selena –por ahora, preparemos todo, aliste los ingredientes para la poción, mientras yo analizo la esfera-. A la madrugada siguiente, cuando aparecía los primeros rayos del sol, Kara levantó sus ojos después de dormir en el bosque, mirando a un conejo quien comía en frente de ella. -Hola, buenos días… - saludó Kara con ternura. Más adelante, cayó una pequeña pelota hacia los arbustos, seguidamente, llegó una jovencita vestida de beisbolista, quien la recogió y regresó corriendo. Kara se acercó a ver, para conocer que era un partido de softbol. Quienes estaban jugando eran estudiantes de un colegio, la kriptoniana echó un vistazo a otras estudiantes del mismo colegio vestidas de uniforme, mirando detalladamente a cada una de las prendas. Luego surgió una idea: caminó entre los grandes árboles para convertir su traje en uniforme del colegio, su larga cabellera rubia se transformó en cabellera de color marrón hacia los hombros, además de traer un morral similar al que portaban las estudiantes. Cuando caminó por el lugar, se tropezó con un joven que hacía labores en los jardines de aquel colegio, cayendo ambos al suelo. -¡EEEYYY!– Se quejó el joven, quien al verla se dispensó –discúlpame señorita– el joven era corpulento y con buen semblante en su rostro juvenil. -No, perdóname en no fijarme bien– excusó la joven. -¿Te conozco de algún lado?– preguntó el joven. -Para nada, es el primer día que vengo a clases en este colegio– respondió la señorita. -Ahh, claro– expresó el joven -¿me imagino que andas buscando la oficina del director Danvers?-. -Eh…si…- contestó confundida la joven. -Mira, vaya subiendo en aquella colina, allá encontrarás el edificio, eso sí, cuidado con los carros y buses que pasan por el camino. Cuando cruces, vaya entrando al edificio, camina por el pasillo principal y buscarás la oficina de la dirección del colegio– indicó el joven. -Gracias…- al agradecer Kara, el joven añadió. -Ethan, me llamo Ethan, soy jardinero y estoy arreglando estos jardines… a propósito ¿cómo te llamas?-. -Me llamo… Linda– Kara sabía que si decía su verdadero nombre, tendría problemas. -Linda… que bonito nombre– dijo sonriente Ethan –encantado de conocerte, si quieres, nos hablamos luego-. -Claro…- tras agradecer, Linda (es decir, Kara) caminó hacia el edificio. Pasó por el pasillo y subiendo por las escaleras, preguntó a dos estudiantes que bajaban. -Disculpen… ¿Dónde está la oficina del director?-. -Mire a ésta– cuestionó altanera una de las estudiantes -¿cómo es que vienen más estudiantes nuevas?, como si no se cerraran las inscripciones y matrículas en este colegio-. -Está al lado derecho, al fondo– respondió la compañera, Linda les agradeció, pero las dos estudiantes no contestaron, siguiendo su rumbo. Al llegar a la puerta de la oficina, abrió y entró; en ese mismo momento, el director Danvers tomaba una pastilla para controlar su estrés. -Buenos días director, mira…- cuando Linda saludaba, el director se incomodó. -¿Usted no sabe que es mala educación entrar a una oficina o aula de clase sin golpear la puerta?-. -Disculpe señor director– apenada, Linda cerró la puerta. -¿Señorita, ahora qué haces si ya entró?– cuestionó el director, Linda golpeó tres veces la puerta y el director negó con su cabeza. -Adelante, señorita-. -Ahora sí, buenos días, mira quisiera…- a pesar de eso, el director la interrumpió. -Espera un momento…- el director se levantó de su escritorio –nunca la he visto en este colegio, ¿usted es nueva?-. -Sí señor, soy nueva– contestó Linda. -¿Se puede saber cómo se llama?– investigó serio el director, Kara manifestó con el siguiente nombre. -Me llamo… Linda Danvers– la contestación dejó asombrado al director. -¿Linda? ¿Eres familiar cercano o lejano?– curioseó el director. -Pues mira, lo que pasa es que mis padres fallecieron cuando era muy pequeña, después la familia Lee me adoptó, ya que, eran oriundos de la ciudad de Metrópolis. Seguramente, soy pariente lejano suyo, señor – mintió Linda. -A ver… - dudó el director -¿Sus padres fueron de Minnesota?-. -No me acuerdo… yo creo que sí…- timó Linda –ya que era muy pequeña y no tenía uso de razón-. -Entiendo…- apuntó el director –ahora, lo que quiero saber es ¿si tiene carta de recomendación?– ese interrogante dejó pensativa a Linda. -La verdad es que…- no obstante Nigel interrumpió, entrando a la oficina bastante enfadado. -¡Director Danvers! Esto es insoportable. Esas alumnas hicieron una broma pesada durante mi clase, ¡están colmando mi paciencia!– al escucharlo, Linda sonrió, suspirando de alivio. -Profesor, ¿qué sucede?– indagó el director. -Esas chiquillas maleducadas cerraron con clavos y pegante el escritorio; donde están los exámenes que estaba inspeccionando. Necesito urgentemente que me acompañes y tome correctivos de inmediato– Nigel esperó en el pasillo. -Lo haré de una vez, no quiero que la imagen de nuestro colegio se caiga al piso por esos comportamientos infantiles– dijo el director, quien avisó a Linda: -Señorita, le pido que se quede en la oficina mientras soluciono ese problema. Seré fuerte como una roca– y acompañó a Nigel para afrontar el inconveniente. Cuando Linda estaba encerrada en la oficina, comenzó a redactar la carta rápidamente en la máquina de escribir con una increíble velocidad y precisión, de otra manera, si redactaba en el computador tendría problemas; después, sacó la carta hecha, limpia, sin errores de ortografía; con esa misma agilidad abrió el archivero de la oficina, buscó la carpeta con la letra K, la colocó en la carpeta y se sentó; todo ello en menos de dos minutos. Cinco minutos después regresó el director. -Bueno, ¿en qué quedamos?– preguntó el director. -En la carta de recomendación…– recordó sonriente Linda. -Ahh si, ¿y entonces?– cuestionó el director. -No sé si llegó a su oficina por correspondencia una reciente carta que envió mi primo, recomendándome– comentó Linda. -La verdad no me acuerdo, pero lo buscaré- el director se acercó al archivero para revisar, Linda siguió dialogando. -Seguramente está con la letra K de Kent–. -¿Kent?–. El director buscó en las carpetas, encontrando la carpeta, sacó la carta, se sentó y la leyó: \"Respetado señor Danvers. Envío esta carta para recomendar a la señorita Linda Danvers, para que termine toda la secundaria en el Colegio Femenino. Por consiguiente, ella tiene grandes cualidades y con buena formación. Fue adoptada por la familia Lee a temprana edad cuando sus padres biológicos murieron en un accidente. Espero que acepte esta recomendación. Estaré totalmente agradecido. CLARK KENT Reportero THE DAILY PLANET\" Al leer, el director se maravilló. -Bueno, esta carta tiene toda validez, de una vez la aceptamos para que ingrese en nuestro colegio, en este sentido, tenemos el mejor nivel académico de los colegios de la región en estos últimos años, lo que es más, no recibimos fácilmente a cualquier estudiante -. -Gracias señor director…- agradeció Linda. -Espero que estudies bien, de tal manera que, estamos en continuos y permanentes cambios en este diminuto planeta– advirtió el director. -Claro, lo entiendo…- reconoció Linda. El director vio con buenos ojos a Linda, por eso, explicaba sobre todo el proyecto educativo del colegio, dando indicaciones para que se adaptara. Así las cosas, ambos salieron de la oficina, mostrando los lugares y sitios del colegio, llegando a las habitaciones de las estudiantes, explicando sobre las materias del estudio. -…En nuestro colegio, enseñamos: matemáticas, filosofía, lenguas extranjeras, historia, física, trigonometría…- dejando una gran incógnita a Linda. -¿También trigonometría?–. -…cálculo, artes y química– enseñó el director, añadiendo –Eso sí, una advertencia: los pasatiempos y el ocio que no tengan que ver con la cultura de nuestro colegio será erradicados; por lo tanto, tenga cuidado en lo que vas hacer en su tiempo libre… Bueno, llegamos-. Cuando llegaron, las estudiantes que estaban ejercitando y otras tapadas de toallas se asustaron al ver llegar al director, decidieron correr a sus respectivas habitaciones. El director entró con Linda, buscando una habitación. Al recordar una, fue directamente al que quedaba en un rincón, desde ahí golpeó la puerta. -Señorita Lein, sé que estás ahí, responda… - citó el director. Lucy, hermana de Lois abrió la puerta asustada. -Director Danvers, por ahora no estoy presentada– respondió aterrada Lucy. -¡Y no lo estarás! chiquilla embustera…– el director entró viendo el desorden que estaba en la habitación, posteriormente indicó a Linda, quien miraba por todos lados –A ver señorita, no tengo tiempo en esperar–. Linda entró en la habitación, Lucy reaccionó inesperada por el ingreso de una nueva estudiante. -Pero director, si estoy bien sola en esta habitación– expresó sorprendida Lucy. -Tendrás que compartir su habitación, recuerde que las decisiones endurecen nuestra piel– respondió radical el director, presentando a Linda con una Lucy refunfuñada –Lucy Lein, le presento a Linda Danvers, viene desde Metrópolis, recomendada por su primo quien es reportero del Daily Planet-. -Hola– saludó seca Lucy. -Hola, ¿cómo estás?– respondió contenta Linda. Lucy extendió su mano para estrecharla con la de Linda, ella no entendía qué era un apretón de manos y en vez de preguntar, aceptó el saludo. -¡Ahh!– recordó algo el director –si no me acuerdo, su hermana también trabaja en ese periódico, además, siempre me llama varias veces para saber sobre usted… ¿cómo es que se llama su hermana?-. -Se llama Lois– manifestó Lucy. -Correcto– tras decir, se retiraba el director –las dejo solas para que comiencen a compartir la habitación– en el momento de cerrar la puerta, dijo en voz baja a Lucy –espero que esta vez trate bien a su nueva compañera, porque le recuerdo que tiene matrícula condicional– dejándola enojada, quien dio una ojeada a Linda, se sentó en su cama y se tapó su rostro con una revista. Linda se quedó parada, contemplando a su nueva compañera. -¿Cómo se llama su primo?– preguntó Lucy. -Se llama Clark Kent– contestó Linda, Lucy admiró. -¿No te creo?-. -Es la verdad– reveló sonriente Linda. -No puedo creer que Clark tenga un pariente, eso nunca me han dicho ni mi hermana ni él-. -Me imagino, porque la verdad comparto muy poco tiempo con mi primo, por estar casi todos los días estudiando. Cuando me queda algo de tiempo, arreglo mi anterior cuarto en Metrópolis– mintió Linda. -¿Eres juiciosa con sus quehaceres?, que bien…– Inquirió Lucy, mirando a Linda desempacando pertenencias de su morral –Veo que no tienes suficiente ropa para estar buen tiempo por acá-. -Lo que pasa es que tengo que comprar ropa…- sin embargo, Linda miró con exhalación que detrás de Lucy estaba pegado un afiche en la pared de la habitación, era la foto de Superman (es decir, su primo) –¿Conoces a este personaje?-. -¿Que si lo conozco?– Expresó contenta Lucy – ¿A Superman? ¡Claro! Mejor dicho, es un gran amigo de todos, especialmente de su primo y de mi hermana– Linda se acercó hacia el afiche y lo contempló fijamente, mientras Lucy continuaba hablando –Si quieres, te presto mi ropa, ya que hay pocos almacenes de ropa en Smallville. Sinceramente me caes bien Linda, espero que seamos buenas amigas-. -Gracias Lucy, te lo agradezco mucho– al agradecer, Linda tocó suavemente con su mano derecha la fotografía de su primo. \"Espero algún día poder verte Kal-El\", pensó sonriente. Varias horas después, Linda entró a clases de la tarde, la última hora antes de anochecer era clase de trigonometría en el aula de sistemas, por ende, el profesor era Nigel. -Bueno señoritas, hoy veremos una de las interesantes lecciones, analizaremos sobre una de las inquietudes que ustedes dejaron cuando les di la tarea de solucionar ecuaciones…- mientras tanto, Linda hablaba en voz baja con Lucy. -Voy a tener dificultades con esta materia-. -Tranquila Linda, yo te explicaré con todos los detalles– indicó Lucy en voz baja. -¡Atención señoritas! Si durante la clase de hoy se portan bien y entenderán perfectamente el tema; les revelaré un secreto de la forma rápida en solucionar la ecuación- advirtió Nigel. Cuando Nigel explicaba durante la clase, afueras del colegio llegó un automóvil donde venían Selena y Bianca; ambas echaron una mirada detenidamente a las estudiantes practicando deporte. -Selena, ¿encontraste a la persona indicada para nuestros planes?– preguntó Bianca. -Estoy mirando a cada una, pero ninguna me sirve- negó Selena. De repente, ella notó que el cofre negro en donde estaba guardado el Omegahedron comenzó a mover bruscamente, el automóvil que estaba moviendo lentamente se prendía y se apagaba a la vez; asustando a ambas. -Esto no me está gustando Selena, estoy segura que es esa extraña esfera– señaló nerviosa Bianca. -Claro…- Selena volteó a ver al otro lado –Bianca, apague un momento el auto…– y vio a Ethan cortando ramas de hojas marchitas de un árbol –creo que este joven apuesto nos servirá, además, me gustaría que él sea mi esposo-. -Lástima– Bianca también dio su ojeada –yo también lo quiero…-. -Pues lo cogí primero, asimismo, prepararé una poción diferente, uno de amor para que ese joven se enamore de mí– expresó pensativa Selena. En el transcurso de la clase, Linda percibió que la pulsera brillaba y la observó con disimulo. Sabía que el Omegahedron estaba cerca, volteó su mirada hacia la pared usando rayos x de sus ojos, notando un automóvil con las dos señoritas que iba a otro lugar. \"Estoy segura que ellas lo tienen, tengo que recuperar el Omegahedron…\" cuando Linda pensaba, se levantó de su puesto, en ese momento, Nigel se percató cuando Linda fue hacia la puerta. -Señorita, ¿puedo saber para dónde va si no ha terminado la clase?– curioseó Nigel. -¡Ay!… perdón profesor– contestó apenada Linda. -¿Sabes en dónde estás ahora?– inquirió serio Nigel. -Acá estoy, en La Tierra señor…- la respuesta de Linda produjo risas de sus compañeras. -Y si estás acá, entonces ¿me imagino que entendió muy bien la clase de hoy?– preguntó Nigel. -Si lo entiendo, lo que pasa es que yo…- mientras Linda trataba de explicar, Nigel interrumpió. -¡Qué bueno! Entonces escuchamos a Linda, diciendo cuál es el resultado total de la ecuación-. Linda se sentó, revisó sus apuntes y como era sencillo respondió correctamente, dejando en silencio a toda la clase. En minutos las compañeras volvieron a carcajear. En ese momento, sonó el timbre avisando que terminaba la clase, Lucy aprovechó la situación para avisar a Linda. -Tenemos que ir, antes que el profesor te llame la atención -. Nigel revisó el problema, por lo cual, el resultado que sacó del computador concordó con la respuesta de Linda, se fastidió y la llamó. -¡Linda!–. -Dime señor profesor…- respondió Linda. -¿Usted estaba espiando la respuesta?– inquirió enojado Nigel. -No, para nada señor…– expresó temerosa Linda. -Entonces, ¿por qué acertó en semejante respuesta?-. -Porque… es…- al momento de contestar Linda, Lucy interrumpió la conversación. -Es por los constantes rayos que estamos expuestas, por ese motivo, nos dejan más inteligentes y capaces, esperamos no incomodar señor profesor–. Aunque la respuesta era tonta, Nigel pensó si era cierto lo que explicaba Lucy, quien por su parte, sacó a Linda del aula de sistemas. -Gracias Lucy por salvarme– agradeció Linda, respirando hondo. -¿Cómo es que sabías sobre semejante respuesta?- preguntó sensata Lucy. -Pues sinceramente no soy tan buena en la trigonometría hexadimensional, pero esa ecuación me pareció fácil- reconoció Linda. -Mira…- aconsejó Lucy –es mejor que no te vayas a mostrar lo superdotada que eres, porque seguramente varias de nuestras compañeras pensarán mal de ti-. -Pero si respondí bien…– insistió Linda. -Linda, eres muy diferente a cualquier estudiante de este colegio, pero bueno, ya todo pasó…- dicho ello Lucy se fue, dejando pensativa a Linda. A la mañana siguiente, en los pasillos de las habitaciones, la mayoría de las estudiantes realizaron a escondidas la forma de hacer el desayuno entre ellas. En seguida, Linda salió de su cuarto para ir a la biblioteca del colegio, llevando sus cuadernos. -Hola Linda, ¿Quieres desayunar con nosotras?– invitó Lucy. -No Lucy, quiero adelantar mis trabajos– rehusó Linda. Sin embargo, se levantó una de las compañeras arrebatando los cuadernos de Linda al piso, pronto, algunas se rieron sobre el hecho. -Le pido que levantes mis cuadernos– pidió seria Linda. -Dime la palabra mágica y te devuelvo tus cuadernos– contestó la joven, sin mirar. -Por favor, le pido que devuelve mis cuadernos…- solicitó Linda. -Y entonces ¿por qué no lo levantas tú misma, princesita?– contestó burlona la joven, quien miró la cara enojada de Linda, a Lucy no gustó la broma. -Mire Mayra, devuélvale lo que arrebataste– exigió Lucy. -¿Quieres inducirme?– al mismo tiempo de la provocación de Mayra, llegó una señora quien administraba las habitaciones de las estudiantes. -Señoritas, ¿Quién les dijo que en los pasillos de las habitaciones se hacen comida?– eso alertó a todas, quienes se levantaron. Linda aprovechó la circunstancia para recoger sus cuadernos –Si quieren desayunar, que lo hagan en la cafetería, pero no acá, porque si las veo de nuevo con eso, reporto a la Dirección para que tome correctivos al respecto-. -Tranquila señora Murphy, no volveremos a cometer el error– expresó Mayra. -Entonces, ¡recojan todo de inmediato!– las estudiantes acataron la orden, mientras Linda se acercó a Lucy. -No sabía que se comportaran de esa manera-. -Si supieras, Mayra y Geraldine son las que mandan. Te advierto: si te enfrentas, tendrás bastantes problemas– aconsejó Lucy –bueno, hoy tendremos práctica deportiva, jugaremos jockey sobre ruedas, espero que nos acompañes-. -Claro, termino en adelantar mis trabajos y vendré a jugar– respondió Linda. Horas después, todas las alumnas jugaban jockey, así mismo, como Linda no sabía jugar bien trató de quedar en la defensa, mientras Lucy, Mayra y Geraldine jugaban en la delantera. En el momento que Lucy recogía la pelota, Mayra la despistó golpeando su palo en uno de los patines haciéndole caer al suelo, preocupada Linda socorrió a su compañera. -¿Estás bien?– examinó alarmada Linda. -Si… estoy bien– contestó golpeada Lucy. Mayra y Geraldine se decían al oído. -Muy bien Mayra–. -Eso apenas comienza– murmuró sarcástica Mayra. Cuando reanudó el partido, Linda señaló al oído de Lucy. -Ellas lo hicieron a propósito-. -Tranquila Linda, eso siempre pasa…- reconoció un poco resentida Lucy, aunque Linda sabía que su compañera no estaba bien. El partido continuó en su curso. En un saque, Mayra miró pícara a Lucy, luego, en vez de pasar la pelota a Geraldine, alzó su palo lo más alto posible y golpeó fuerte a la pelota en dirección al rostro de Lucy. Linda, al ver la jugada, rápidamente abrazó a Lucy, recibiendo de espalda el fuerte impacto. Todas se aterraron, suspendieron el partido y se acercaron para ayudarlas a ambas. -¿Qué pasó? ¿Están bien?– indagaron varias compañeras, Linda se volteó, sabiendo que no le afectó el fuerte golpe. -Estoy bien, es mejor pedir cambio de jugadora para que Lucy descanse–. Geraldine y Mayra se sorprendieron ante lo ocurrido. -Esta Linda sí que es entrometida– refunfuñó Mayra. -Lo más raro es que a cualquiera le dolería con ese tiro que hiciste, pero no pasó nada a ella– consideró Geraldine. Terminado el partido, todas las estudiantes entraron a los camerinos, menos Mayra y Geraldine, quienes planearon una broma pesada hacia sus compañeras, especialmente a Linda. -Linda, agradezco mucho que me salvara, pero ¿te dolió?– preguntó Lucy. -Para nada. Siempre hago ejercicios de gimnasia y pesas, la verdad me acostumbro en recibir esa clase de golpes– mintió Linda. Más adelante en las duchas, Lucy armó conversación con las compañeras. -Oigan todas, ¿se acuerdan de aquel nuevo jardinero que está cuidando los jardines del colegio? Pues supe que él es soltero… cómo me encantaría enamorarme de ese guapo jardinero -. Mientras Lucy hablaba, Linda disfrutaba del agua caliente, por ende, era la primera vez que se bañaba en la ducha. Ellas no sabían que en la parte de las tuberías y calderas entraron Mayra y Geraldine, llevando una llave de tubería para alterar las llaves y afectar al resto de las estudiantes. En seguida, Mayra manipulaba una de las válvulas. -¿Es necesario hacer esto para contentarte y conseguir a que las demás culpen a Lucy y a Linda?– cuestionó Geraldine. -¡Claro!– Exclamó irónica Mayra –si no consigo esto, entonces ¿qué hago? ¿Que me quede sin conseguir lo que quiero?-. Linda disfrutaba de su baño, sin embargo, sintió en sus oídos la conversación de Mayra y Geraldine al otro lado de la pared. -…además, ella no sabe con quién se mete, pero lo va saber– comentó Mayra, apretando la válvula. -Pues espero que esto salga…– indicó Geraldine. Tras escuchar, Linda fijó sus ojos hacia la pared, emitiendo rayos x al otro lado, de repente, conoció que Mayra forzaba la válvula con la llave, apoyada por Geraldine. -…porque si no lo conseguimos, dejarás de ser la mandamás de este colegio– continuó Geraldine. -De ninguna manera, no me dejaré, haré la vida imposible para que sufra esa princesita…- dijo rabiosa Mayra. Eso disgustó a Linda, quien aprovechó en mirar establemente a la llave emitiendo rayos de calor de sus ojos, penetrando fácilmente a la pared para recalentar la llave que tenía Mayra. Al sentir el fuerte ardor, Mayra soltó sus manos gimiendo; al mismo tiempo, la válvula no aguantó la presión, dispersando el agua de los tubos por todos lados, mojando por completo a las dos entrometidas estudiantes, quienes descubiertas por el resto de sus compañeras, corrieron horrorizadas. -¡Espero que hayan disfrutado de su baño vestidas, porque se ven muy bien mojadas para tomar una foto! – carcajeó Lucy. Todas estallaron de risa y aplaudieron, sin preguntar lo que aconteció. Horas después, en las habitaciones de las estudiantes, Linda se puso el uniforme, se arregló y mostró feliz a Lucy. -Mira, ¿cómo estoy?– Linda pensaba que se sentía muy atractiva con el uniforme puesto. -La verdad…- pensó Lucy en voz alta –te ves como siempre, como una estudiante común– desilusionando a Linda, quien se sentó en la cama –si quieres ser atractiva y llamativa, tienes que poner otros vestidos adecuados, lo que es más, podrás ponerte aretes y pendientes en tus orejas -. -¿Cómo así?– dudó Linda -¿solamente en perforar las orejas de aretes servirá como atractivo?-. -Por supuesto– expresó Lucy –solo hay que perforar en donde no haya dolor, colocas los aretes y listo, todos los hombres se caen rendidos–. A la vez que Lucy contaba, Linda vio en la cama un brassier, como no sabía qué era lo colocó sobre su cabeza, posteriormente, lo puso por encima de su chaqueta de uniforme, colocando pañuelos en ambos lados, para ver cómo quedaba. Lucy notó y se extrañó lo que hacía Linda. - ¿Qué haces con mi brassier?- cuestionó extrañada Lucy. -No, nada… solamente ocurrencias, no me pongas caso– manifestó apenada Linda. -Como te iba diciendo, estos días que vienen serán tres días de descanso, espero que me acompañes y disfrutes todo lo que te voy a mostrar. Hay lugares donde hacen tatuajes y percings muy buenos– contaba Lucy, a pesar de eso, Linda recordó su misión. -Emm…, me encantaría ir contigo pero no podré ir, quiero aprovechar mis ratos libres por acá– mintió Linda. -Lástima– manifestó Lucy alistando sus cosas –más adelante vendrán varios amigos míos, entre ellos uno que tal vez conozcas, me refiero a un amigo de tu primo, se llama Jimmy Olsen, el camarógrafo del Daily Planet; el vendrá mañana porque quiere pasar buenos ratos conmigo-. -Te deseo buena suerte con Jimmy y mándale saludos de mi parte– expresó Linda. Al día siguiente, la mayoría de las estudiantes se fueron con sus familiares a sus casas. Lucy se despidió de Linda, quien estaba analizando los planos y mapas de Metrópolis, Smallville y ciudades cercanas. Cuando todas se fueron, Linda analizaba un plan para la búsqueda del Omegahedron, no obstante, cuando caminaba directamente a su habitación, era observada por el director Danvers, ocurriéndole una idea. -Señorita, ¿Por qué no viene su primo? – el director pilló aturdida a Linda. -La verdad… es que mi primo está de viaje por largo tiempo, desafortunadamente, no podré estar en la finca de los Kent, por eso decidí quedarme acá en estos días– mintió Linda. -Si quieres, puedes pasar estos días de descanso en mi casa, que queda a pocos kilómetros del colegio– invitó el director. -No lo sé… ¿Todo el día? – dudó un poco inconforme Linda. -Pues le llevo hasta acá por la noche y no hay problema; entonces, ¿aceptas mi invitación? – insistió el director, entre tanto Linda pensó y tomó una decisión. -Bueno, acepto– tras expresar Linda, el director preparó todo, luego, llevó a Linda en su automóvil y se marcharon hacia la casa de los Danvers. Durante el trayecto, Linda pensó en el Omegahedron. Escrito inicialmente el día lunes, 25 de enero de 2010. Editado para el Sitio Bagatela el sábado 10 de julio de 2010.

En una casa, a pocos kilómetros del Colegio Femenino, llegaron el director Danvers y Linda en automóvil, de tal manera que ambos se bajaron del auto. Al frente de la puerta los recibía la esposa del director. -¡Hola mi muñeco!– salió sonriente la señora Danvers. -Hola mi bombón– respondió el director, en ese momento ambos se dieron un leve beso. -Veo que tenemos compañía– expresó la señora mirando a Linda. -Ahh, claro– recordó el director, avisando a Linda quien miraba todo alrededor –Linda, ven que mi esposa te quiere conocer– la joven fue a donde estaba la señora Danvers, quien saludó. -¿Cómo te llamas, encantadora jovencita?-. -Me llamo Linda Danvers– la respuesta de Linda dejó asombrada a la esposa del director. -No me digas ¿eres pariente nuestra? – curioseó la señora. -Lejana, soy más cercana a la familia Kent– mintió Linda. -Conozco a la familia, en verdad nunca me habían hablado de ti– inquirió la señora. -Linda vivió varios años en Metrópolis junto con la familia Lee, ya que sus padres fallecieron cuando era muy pequeña, además, comparte en algunas ocasiones con su primo Clark Kent– expuso el director. -El reportero del Daily Planet, entiendo… bueno Linda, encantada en saludarte y bienvenida a nuestra casa– saludó alegre la señora Danvers. -Gracias, el gusto es mío– retribuyó Linda. Los tres entraron a la casa, allá pasaron conversando sobre sus vidas, almorzaron y después Linda ayudó amablemente a la señora Danvers en lavar la loza. -¿Ustedes se conocieron cuando eran jóvenes?– sondeó Linda. -Por supuesto, George siempre hacía locuras en el momento de conquista y yo no aguantaba con sus locuras– sonrió la señora Danvers. -El director sí que tiene sentido de humor, pero Helen ¿el es drástico?– siguió indagando Linda. -No tanto. Es amable, amigable, comprensible y cariñoso, mira…- Helen aprovechó en aconsejar –si quieres tener novio y que la relación perdure, debes conocer todos los aspectos, tanto en los positivos como en los negativos; además, puedes querer y amar verdaderamente, demostrando tus verdaderos sentimientos, eso me pasó con mi esposo y nos funcionó-. -Agradezco tu consejo, lo tendré presente– apuntó sonriente Linda. Después de lavar platos, el director estimuló a Linda en jugar ajedrez. -La verdad es que nunca juego– negó Linda, por ello, Helen comenzó en mostrar el juego. Cuando Linda entendió, Helen había ganado a George. -Ahora voy yo– decidió Linda en jugar. George pensaba que podía ganar, pero se sorprendió que en pocas jugadas no pudiera ganar a Linda. -No lo puedo creer señorita– comentó atolondrado el director. -Creo que tuve suerte en mi primera vez– confesó retraída Linda. -Ahora iniciemos de nuevo, esta vez será en serio– arriesgó el director. A pesar de las ganas de arrollar, no entendía de los movimientos sencillos que jugaba Linda en el ajedrez, seguidamente el director realizó una jugada de desesperación para acercar a una de las fichas importantes, aunque, Linda volvió a ganar. -Veo que no es tu día George– dijo sonriente Helen. -No entiendo… Linda, definitivamente eres muy inteligente y buena en jugar ajedrez, cómo me gustaría que representaras al Colegio Femenino en los juegos estatales– propuso atónito el director. -Agradezco mucho, pero me da pena en aceptar, porque el ajedrez no es uno de mis pasatiempos favoritos– confesó Linda. -Pese a esto, ¿me imagino que te gustó jugar por un momento al ajedrez?– indagó Helen, a quien Linda sonrió acertando con su cabeza. Llegando el atardecer, George llamó a Linda para regresar, más tarde, los tres caminaron hacia el portón de la casa. -Espero que hayas disfrutado con nosotros este rato, si quieres, puedes venir en cualquier día libre– sugirió contenta Helen. -Les agradezco mucho en acogerme en su casa – manifestó Linda quien se despidió, subió al auto junto con el director y ambos se marcharon al Colegio Femenino. Llegando al colegio, el director dejó a Linda en la portería de las habitaciones, ambos se despidieron y el director fue hacia su casa. Linda se quedó en la portería para que no fuera vista por la señora Murphy, en el momento que la mujer se fuera, caminó hacia el bosque. Era las horas de la noche, dentro del boscaje Linda se sentó, sacó el mapa y la brújula de su maleta, indicó las ciudades que andará y al tener claro, no perdió de vista al sentido oeste; en seguida emprendió a correr, cambió su uniforme rápidamente por el traje similar de su primo; sacó la peluca corta y castaña, dejando su cabellera rubia. Al instante, miró su pulsera y la brújula a la vez, arrancando su vuelo hacia los alrededores de Smallville y de Metrópolis. Durante la búsqueda entre la noche y la madrugada, Kara no percibía la energía del Omegahedron en su pulsera, de tal manera que estaba preocupada. Insistió en la exploración hacia el amanecer, apareciendo los primeros rayos del sol; en eso entonces, decidió parar la búsqueda, retornando a Smallville para entrar en un tubo de alcantarillado en construcción. Allá se cambió de nuevo para poner su vestido de estudiante, sin que nadie se diera cuenta. Esa misma mañana, Ethan recibió una llamada para que fuera hacer un arreglo de jardinería doméstica, fue al lugar donde indicaron la dirección, encontró una casa lujosa, avanzó y timbró en la puerta. -¿Quién es?– preguntó una señora, acercando su ojo izquierdo al agujero de la puerta. -Soy el jardinero, para hacer un arreglo al jardín de su casa– respondió Ethan. -Espera un momento, en el momento abro–. Aquella dama se acercó a uno de los cuartos en donde estaba su compañera, quien estaba preparando una pócima con los ingredientes preparados. -Ya vino nuestro apuesto jardinero– avisó la señora. -Que bien Bianca, ahora tengo todo listo– reveló Selena. Bianca salió del cuarto y fue directamente al portón, lo abrió, saludó a Ethan y lo llevó hacia la sala. Por su parte, Ethan echó un vistazo, sorprendido por el contraste de los colores oscuros entre las paredes y los muebles. -Puedes sentar. ¿Quieres tomar algún refresco antes de comenzar con el arreglo del jardín?– preguntó Bianca, Ethan acertó con su cabeza –entonces me esperas un momento y avisaré a mi señora– dicho ello, Bianca se retiró. Ethan miró curioso toda la sala, pareciera raro que el lugar tuviera una tonalidad oscura. Minutos después apareció Selena. -¿Me imagino que te llamas Ethan, el jardinero que pedí para que arregle mi precioso jardín?– saludó preguntando Selena. -Por supuesto– respondió Ethan parado del sofá –quiero que me indiquen el jardín para empezar mi labor, porque, por la tarde tengo que ir a continuar en otra parte, donde trabajo actualmente-. -Claro, no te preocupes, pero antes te enviamos el refresco– acto seguido, Selena avisó a Bianca para que trajera la pócima. Bianca entregó la pócima a Ethan, quien lo probó, sintiendo un sabor agridulce. -¿Esto qué es?-. -Es un jugo tropical traída del Brasil, espero que te guste– indicó amable Selena, Ethan tomó el refresco de una vez y terminó. -Pues nada mal está el refresco, las felicito– agradeció Ethan. -Gracias– respondió Selena –ahora Bianca te revelará el jardín para que comiences en arreglar, espero que el arreglo sea muy original-. Mientras Ethan y Bianca entraron al jardín, Selena no perdía de vista desde su habitación. En el momento en que Ethan hacía su labor, Bianca se presentó a donde estaba Selena, quien miraba inmutablemente. -¿Cuándo va a surtir efecto la pócima?– indagó Bianca. -Más o menos… unos 30 minutos– manifestó mesurada Selena. Pasaron los 30 minutos, Ethan sentía dolor de cabeza junto con constantes mareos, miraba que el jardín oscurecía, de las ramas y las flores surgieron ojos y manos que lo atrapaban, el joven resistió débilmente, pero cayó al suelo. -Ya es hora Bianca, necesito que lleves a Ethan hasta la sala, acuéstelo en el sofá y esperamos que despierte. Cuando él levante los ojos, me mirará directamente y se enamorará de mí– expresó optimista Selena. Ambas fueron al jardín, recogieron con delicadeza a Ethan y lo llevaron al sofá de la sala, luego Selena lo esperó con la esperanza en que su plan resultara. Una hora después, de manera extraña Ethan abrió levemente sus ojos, sintió mareos frecuentes, no echó un vistazo a Selena y tambaleó lentamente por toda la casa; Selena comenzó a desesperar, ya que no estaba funcionando su plan. -Ethan, es mejor que descanses– demandó Selena. Pero Ethan no puso caso, sintió miedo y decidió buscar una salida sin decir nada. Selena trató de controlar, aunque Ethan salió de la casa hacia la calle; en ese instante, Selena partió en busca de Ethan, notando sorprendida que en la puerta estaba Nigel. -Hola Selena– saludó el hombre –veo que estás preocupada-. -No tengo tiempo en atenderte, tengo un importante asunto por solucionar– respondió enojada Selena, pero Nigel la agarró bruscamente del brazo izquierdo. -Es hora que hablemos sobre la esfera, y no me iré hasta que aclaremos sobre eso– dijo osado Nigel. Ethan por su parte, caminó tambaleando por el camino, viendo que era un lugar raro y desconocido, a su paso interrumpió el tránsito de los automóviles, autobuses y camiones, donde los conductores suscitaron en gritos e insultos para que el joven saliera del camino, sin embargo no los escuchaba, siguiendo en vaivenes directamente a Smallville. Allá, en una de las hamburgueserías, estaban: Lucy, sus amigos y Jimmy, quien había llegado al pueblo. La señorita comía con la vista a la ventana y se alegró en ver a Linda quien caminaba por las calles del pueblo, de una vez se levantó. -Me esperan un momento, porque hallé a mi compañera Linda, ahorita vengo con ella para que todos la conozcan-. -¿Quién?– curioseó sorprendido Jimmy – ¿No es aquella prima de Clark?-. -Si…- reconoció Lucy. La joven abandonó por un momento el lugar para salir a la calle, distinguió a Linda y la llamó: -¡Linda! … ¡Hey, Linda!– Linda escuchó sorprendida, ubicando su sonriente rostro a donde estaba su compañera. -¡Hola Lucy! ¡Ahorita cruzo!– la estudiante echó una mirada a los lados y cruzó la calle para encontrar con Lucy. -¿Dónde andabas?– indagó Lucy – ¿Te aburrió estar en la habitación del colegio?-. -Para nada, lo que pasa es que pasé por poco tiempo en la casa del director Danvers– confesó Linda. -Entonces era bastante aburrido, ¿por qué estuvo por allá?– siguió averiguando Lucy. -Porque soy pariente lejana del director– la contestación de Linda resignó desconcertada a Lucy. -Como dicen, hay roscas de familiares del director…- comentó indignada Lucy. -No te enojes por favor, además, quiero plasmar mi vida por mis propios medios, mas no requiero de otras personas– objetó Linda. -Bueno…- Lucy tomó un respiro y cambió de tema –pues te cuento que estoy con un grupo de amigos en la hamburguesería, uno de ellos es Jimmy, si quieres los presento para que conozcas-. -Pero no tengo permiso, además, tengo puesto el uniforme del colegio…- dudó apenada Linda. -¿Cómo así que no puedes?– cuestionó Lucy –eso no es pretexto, solamente nos acompañas en un momento y luego regresarás-. -Definitivamente te agradezco mucho Lucy– expresó sonriente Linda. -Para eso somos las amigas– al mismo tiempo, las dos se voltearon a la calle, donde escucharon varios alaridos de personas encolerizadas. -¡EHH, mira a dónde vas!-. -¿Este está ebrio o se hace el loco?-. -¡Quítese que estorba!-. Estos y demás bramidos eran dirigidos a Ethan, quien no escuchaba, por ende, estaba inconsciente caminando sin rumbo fijo. -Mira a este borracho– expuso extrañada Lucy, cruzando sus brazos. Linda observó y se dio cuenta que era aquel joven jardinero, con quien se encontró en el primer día que estuvo en el colegio. -¿No es éste el joven jardinero?– examinó preocupada Linda –A propósito, ¿qué es un borracho?-. -¿No sabes?– Lucy explicó brevemente –un borracho es quien se pasa tomando licor casi todos los días, luego se va tambaleando y mareado por las calles hacia rumbo desconocido-. -Pero debemos que ayudarlo– propuso Linda. -Puede ser– aproximó Jimmy hacia las dos jovencitas –aunque es mejor no ayudar, seguramente puede traer una arma blanca o una arma de fuego y nos meterían en graves aprietos– después se presentó –a propósito, me llamo Jimmy Olsen, mucho gusto-. -Me llamo Kara…- la respuesta seria de Linda sorprendió a ambos. -¿Kara?– se preguntaron Jimmy y Lucy al unísono, Linda ojeó a ambos y se apenó. -Es decir… con la cara preocupada y confundida– contrarió Linda. -Es mejor que entremos, seguramente la comida que ordenamos se va a enfriar, allá nos acompañas y hablemos tranquilamente– sugirió Jimmy, las dos aceptaron y entraron a la hamburguesería. Mientras tanto en la casa lujosa, Selena no perdió de vista de los pasos oscilantes de Ethan, Bianca se inquietó. -Debemos que hacer que el joven vuelva hasta acá–. -¿Pero cómo?– indagó Selena. -¿Por qué no usamos el cofre negro donde está la esfera?– propuso Bianca. -Buena idea–. Angustiada Selena, dirigió a donde estaba el cofre negro, lo cogió y la imagen de Ethan se desvanecía; inmediatamente, sacó el cofre y cayó boca arriba, con el cofre negro en forma de pico en sus manos; haciendo que el Omegahedron, que estaba dentro del cofre, comenzaba a mover bruscamente, reapareciendo la imagen de Ethan en el espejo. -¿Qué pasó?– interrogó Bianca -¿estás bien?-. -Estoy bien…– manifestó Selena –pero necesito llamar la mente de Ethan, para que él regrese a mí-. Selena empezó a invocar, usando el Omegahedron para atraer la mente de Ethan; no obstante, del hechizo hizo prender a una máquina traga-tierra que estaba en un sitio de construcción de vivienda. En ese lugar, los obreros se asustaron al ver a la máquina prenderse por sí sola, rompiendo la cerca de madera que delimitaba la zona de construcción con la calle, partiendo directamente hacia Ethan, quien caminaba en medio de la vía. -Me sorprendes Selena…- expresó Bianca. -En verdad no era lo que deseaba, pero con eso atraparé al apuesto joven…- reconoció Serena, mirando atentamente al espejo. La máquina llegó de manera rápida a Ethan, quien abrió un poco más sus ojos, viendo borrosamente la figura de un monstruo que quería comerlo, en seguida se asustó y corrió en forma de meneo en medio del camino, cayendo varias veces. Cuando el chico buscaba a dónde esconder, la máquina lo perseguía, rompiendo las fachadas de varias casas y tiendas, provocando pánico a los habitantes del pueblo que transitaban; Ethan no podía andar y cayó al suelo; dejando que la máquina, con sus dientes de acero, lo recogía y lo llevaba en dirección hacia la casa de Selena, rompiendo más fachadas a su paso. En una estación de gasolina estaba estacionado un automóvil, cuyos ocupantes era una familia, quienes llegaron para tanguear el auto. El niño miró desde la ventana a la máquina que se acercaba y llamó a su mamá. -Mamá, se acerca una máquina-. -Michael, ya te dije que no compraré más juguetes– alegó desconfiada la madre. -No es eso mami, es una máquina de verdad y se acerca hacia acá– intimó el niño. -Si sigues insistiendo, no compraré tu helado– la mamá dio una ojeada en la ventana, se asustó y gritó a su esposo -¡Amor! ¡Prende el auto, rápido!-. El esposo miró al otro lado, se alarmó y trató de encender el vehículo, aunque éste no prendía. La máquina rompió la columna, chocó de manera violenta contra el auto, causando que el señor se golpeara de frente, quedando inconsciente; la señora, su hijo y el bebé gritaron y lloraron desesperadamente. La manguera que estaba conectada con el auto cayó al piso y derramó gasolina por todos lados, el techo de la estación desplomó por encima del auto, cediendo a los avisos publicitarios que derribaban. La máquina continuó su rumbo, rompiendo un poste de luz que bajó al suelo, cerca de la estación de gasolina. Los desesperados habitantes gritaron pidiendo auxilio. Bianca temía algo y expuso a su amiga: -Selena, tengo un mal presentimiento con toda esta situación, sería bueno que lo hiciéramos para otro día…-. -De ninguna manera, estoy convencida que está saliendo muy bien– rehusó Selena. A pocas cuadras de la estación de gasolina quedaba la hamburguesería, donde estaban comiendo: Linda, Lucy, Jimmy y los demás jóvenes. La conversación era amena, hablando de lo que hacían los jóvenes en sus ratos libres, dejando desconcertada a Linda quien no sabía qué decir al respecto; pero dicha conversación era interrumpida por los fuertes ruidos, golpes y explosiones; todos se levantaron y miraron desde la ventana de la hamburguesería lo que estaba acaeciendo. La máquina llevaba a un joven encerrado, Linda fijó su mirada microscópica y se sorprendió de quien estaba atrapado era Ethan, sin embargo, no decía a nadie. Lucy decidió en arriesgar, para tratar de subir y montar a la máquina. -¡Lucy!, ¿Qué haces?– exclamó Linda. -Voy tras Lucy para ayudarla– decidió Jimmy en apoyarla, llevando su cámara fotográfica para tomar las fotos y a la vez en tratar de ayudar a Lucy. -¡Pero es muy peligroso!– advirtió Linda. No obstante, divisó a los alrededores la destrucción que dejaba la máquina: varias casas destrozadas, heridos y muchos en pánico. Mientras Lucy trataba de subir a la máquina y conducirla hacia un lugar más seguro para poder pararla, Linda escuchaba en sus agudos oídos los gritos de clamor de la señora, su hijo y el bebé en llanto desde aquel automóvil atrapado en la estación de gasolina. Sin pensar dos veces, la chica decidió correr rápidamente hacia el baño del establecimiento, cerró la puerta, se quitó el uniforme de estudiante y se puso el traje similar al de su primo; pasando por la ventana del baño directamente al tejado de la hamburguesería. Desde allí contempló la situación: por un lado, Lucy no podía manejar la máquina, por el otro lado en la estación de gasolina, los bomberos no lograban controlar las llamas que llegarían a donde estaba la gasolina derramada, amenazando en rumbo hacia el poste caído, donde prendía chispas de cortos de los cables sueltos. En ese instante, Kara vislumbró fijamente hacia los cables sueltos, emitiendo rayos de calor de sus ojos para neutralizar los cortos y las chispas, luego emprendió su rápido vuelo hacia la estación de gasolina, donde sopló un fuerte viento frío para apagar el incendio. Como los bomberos no alcanzaban a distinguir nada y los habitantes huyeron, nunca se enteraron que Kara estaba en la estación de gasolina. Allá levantó el techo derrumbado de la estación y lo hizo caer en la calle donde no había nadie, cuyo fuerte retumbo del desplome alarmó a los bomberos, quienes se alejaron del lugar pensando que la estación podía destruirse. La hermosa joven fue hacia el auto, arrancó ambas puertas del lado derecho del auto con sus manos y los tiró de lado; sacó al hombre, luego a la señora con el bebé en los brazos y en seguida al niño. Ellos estaban inconscientes por aspirar el humo de las llamas, por lo tanto, a cada uno los acostó cuidadosamente en el piso, posteriormente fue a sacar el auto. En ese momento, el niño abrió sus ojos lentamente y conoció a la joven, pensando: \"Que raro… una señorita vistiendo el mismo traje de Superman…\"; de repente trató de levantar, pero Kara se percató dejando fuera de peligro al auto, acercando a donde estaba el niño. -Gracias…- agradeció el infante, Kara tocó con sus dedos índice y corazón de su mano derecha para callar tiernamente al niño -…quiero saber ¿cómo te llamas?...–. -Soy una amiga… pero te pido un favor, no cuentes a nadie que estoy acá, quedemos como un secreto, ¿prometido?– pidió Kara. -Te prometo… amiga…- contestó sonriente el niño. -Recuéstate, pronto vendrá la ayuda para ampararlos– después de recomendar, Kara voló. En ese instante, dio cuenta que Lucy sufrió un golpe estando sentada en la máquina, el cual, la dejó inconsciente; como hubo bastante fuego por casi toda la calle, vio un enorme tanque de agua, voló hacia allá y con velocidad supersónica lo traspasó, abriendo dos grandes agujeros que al instante cayó agua, controlando gran parte del incendio. Más adelante, fue a donde estaba la máquina, levantando con su rápido vuelo todo el humo y polvo del piso, dejando sin visión en minutos a todos los presentes. En el instante que Kara llegaba a la máquina, Selena se pasmó. -No puede ser… - expresó Serena mirando la situación, Bianca también lo notó. -No creo que sea Superman, ¿quién es? – cuestionó Bianca. -Es una chica, vistiendo un disfraz de Superman… tal vez la llamen Supergirl– declaró Selena. Kara agarró entre la caja y las ruedas de la máquina, frenando con bastante fuerza para que la máquina perdiera velocidad; pronto, arrancó la caja en donde estaba atrapado Ethan con sus manos, llevándolo hacia una zona de hierba. Al voltear, miró que la máquina continuaba a paso lento con Lucy dentro, voló rápidamente antes que la máquina destrozara una vivienda, se detuvo en el andén y con sus manos paralizó con fuerza a la máquina. Inmediatamente, sacó a Lucy de la cabina, dejándola en el piso con cuidado y al ver que Lucy estaba bien, se elevó de nuevo a donde estaba Ethan. Jimmy alcanzó a ver lo que hizo Kara, trató de llamarla pero ella se marchó, al instante corrió a donde estaba Lucy. -Lucy, ¿estás bien?– examinó preocupado Jimmy, ella reaccionó abriendo sus ojos y cogió sus manos en la cabeza. -Estoy bien…gracias Jimmy por salvarme…- manifestó Lucy. -No me agradezcas, más bien agradézcale a una chica, vestida de forma similar a Superman, quien te salvó– aclaró sonriente Jimmy. -¿Cómo…? – indagó Lucy, sintiendo un pequeño dolor en su cabeza. -Sí, vi que te salvó. Creo que hay más personas del planeta que vino Superman, tal vez a ella la llaman Supergirl… Pero me alegro que estés bien– afirmó Jimmy. -¿Crees que ella forma parte de aquellos sujetos que acompañaron a Zod? – preguntó Lucy. -No creo, más bien puede ser amiga o familiar de Superman, si vino acá es para salvar vidas. Es mejor que te lleve a casa para que olvidemos de este incidente– con esas palabras, Jimmy levantó a Lucy en sus brazos y la llevó directamente hacia la casa de la familia Lein. Por su parte, Kara llevó la caja hacia los lados cercanos del hospital del pueblo, allá abrió los dientes de la caja fácilmente y miró a un Ethan inconsciente; en poco tiempo, éste reaccionó y abrió sus ojos poco a poco. Cuando Selena los vigilaba a través de su espejo, intentó en decir: \"No la mires, no le digas…\". Pero Ethan, al abrir completamente sus ojos, vio a una hermosa joven rubia con rostro angelical y ojos de color azul profundo, pronto creyó haber visto a un ángel. -Todo está bien, no sufriste de golpes fuertes– explicó Kara. Ethan, al verla, se enamoró a primera vista. -Te quiero…- esas palabras dulces de Ethan dejó extrañada a Kara. -¿Cómo me has dicho?– preguntó confundida Kara. -Te amo, nunca he visto a una chica tan hermosa en este mundo– reveló Ethan levantando y poniendo en frente de Kara. Por su parte, a Selena no gustó nada. -¡NOOOO…!– vociferó con bastante enojo Selena, cogiendo su cabeza. -¿Me amas? Pero no te conozco…– osciló Kara. Pero Ethan se acercó y la besó en sus labios, después se desmayó en los brazos de la joven, quien pensó confundida y sonriente: \"Será mejor que lo lleve hasta aquel hospital para que lo atiendan\"; dejó a Ethan en el suelo cuidadosamente (en ese momento Selena no quería saber ni ver nada en el espejo), se vistió de nuevo con el uniforme del colegio, alzó a Ethan en sus brazos y lo llevó hacia el hospital, disimulando que cargaba algo pesado. -¡Necesito un médico! ¡Llevo un joven herido!– los alaridos de Linda eran atendidos por uno de los médicos. -¿Cómo se accidentó?– preguntó el médico, preparando la camilla con la enfermera. -Lo encontré inconsciente y golpeado en un accidente– respondió Linda. La atención en el hospital era inmediata, entrando al hospital lo llevaron al quirófano, Linda los siguió hacia la puerta donde no dejaron pasar y la enfermera tomó los datos, interrogando a Linda. Posteriormente, Linda quedó esperando hacia del atardecer en el hospital, averiguando sobre el estado de salud de Ethan, ya que sentía algo raro a partir de aquel primer beso que recibió.

Saliendo del hospital rumbo a las habitaciones del internado del Colegio Femenino, Linda pensaba una y otra vez sobre el beso que dio Ethan a sus labios, cuando ella lo salvó como Kara; en verdad, era el primer beso que recibía, sintiendo una paradójica sensación hacia aquel joven jardinero; sin embargo, ese suceso consintió su felicidad, acariciando sus labios con los dedos de su mano derecha. Selena, por su parte, se indagaba una y otra vez sobre la aparición de aquella chica. -No entiendo sobre ella, tampoco sé de dónde llegó, lo que si sé es que robó a mí apuesto jardinero y eso no la voy a perdonar-. -Selena, tienes que ser fuerte, seguramente todo ser humano se enamora realmente de quien le guste…- Bianca trató de tranquilizar a Selena. -¡Pero yo quiero tener a ese joven en mis brazos!– insistió Selena. -En definitiva no lo amas, solo quieres experimentar con él– trató de meter en razón Bianca, aunque Selena omitió caso, preparando algo de inmediato. Sacó el cofre negro donde estaba el Omegahedron y elaboró un conjuro para encontrar a Supergirl y destruirla. Entre las frases de su conjuro, mencionó. -Ordeno que encuentres a aquella jovencita quien usurpó a mí querido… cuando la encuentres, elimínela…-. Bianca no estuvo de acuerdo, más bien, decidió no interrumpir; ya que sabía que Supergirl tiene los mismos poderes de Superman y era dificultoso que Selena controle la magia para acabar con aquella adolescente. Recitado el conjuro, salió un fuerte remolino desde el cofre negro, mostrando la apariencia de un monstruo invisible quien rompió una de las paredes de la habitación de Selena, dejando horripiladas a ambas. -Creo que se me fue de las manos– comentó Selena. -Claro, si lo hicieras el conjuro afuera, no ocurriría esto– aseveró Bianca. -Pues mañana pediremos que arreglen la pared, mientras veré en el espejo para encontrar a esa chiquilla entrometida– dicho eso, Selena partió a ver lo que pasaría. El monstruo franqueó con pasos agigantados buscando a Supergirl, destruyendo todo lo que transitaba: árboles, carros, tierras, muros. Linda llegó a su habitación, se acostó en la cama e imaginó lo que haría si se enamorara de Ethan. Podía llevarlo a todos los lugares, compartiría con él en todas partes, hasta acompañar en aventuras de enamorados. Sin embargo, los fuertes ruidos desde afueras la hizo despertar, la estudiante se levantó de la cama, caminó hacia la ventana, abrió las persianas viendo un fuerte remolino que arrasaba todo lo que encontraba, rompiendo el muro y dañando un auto cerca de las instalaciones del Colegio Femenino. Linda se enojó, sin pensar se lanzó de la ventana, cambiando de repente a Supergirl, volando hacia la calle cercana al colegio, donde se detuvo haciendo una señal de alto con su mano derecha. -¡Alto ahí! ¡No destroces más!– gritó Kara. Selena, al ver que apareció la joven, se encolerizó. -Por fin la encontré… quiero saber ¿dónde está mi amado?–. La pregunta de Selena sonó como una orden al monstruo invisible, quien atacó a Kara, lanzándola con sus extremidades hacia la pared del colegio, quien sufrió un golpe a espalda y cayó al suelo. Enfurecida Kara se levantó y atacó de una vez, pero fue interceptada por el monstruo, quien la golpeó contra el suelo. -Así se hace Selena– alentó Bianca. Selena se concentraba en dar órdenes al monstruo, quien al instante lanzó a Kara hacia una malla de protección, luego la arrojó contra un poste de luz, golpeándola con bastante fuerza. Kara trató de pensar, miró el poste y ocurrió una idea: rompió el poste, se escapó del monstruo y voló hacia las nubes oscuras, donde aprovechó en atraer los rayos con el poste de metal. En ese momento, Bianca celebró. -¡Por fin, lo logramos!-. -No… creo que no – señaló Serena en tono serio, no descartaba que Supergirl tuviera una estrategia para vencer al monstruo. En efecto, la bruja tuvo razón. Tras recibir bastante energía eléctrica en el poste, Kara voló hacia el colegio, encontró al monstruo, se puso de frente; extendió el poste y expulsó la energía eléctrica directamente al monstruo; a quien lo dejó descubierto, neutralizado y reducido por completo. Selena, al ver que su monstruo era vencido, se irritó. -¡Rayos! ¡Es increíble!, si el trabajo de salvar a este mundo no lo hace Superman, lo hace esa chiquilla entrometida de Supergirl-. -Tenga paciencia Selena, es posible que haya otro método para aniquilar a Supergirl…– tranquilizó Bianca, quien sugirió -Si a Superman lo debilitan con una roca de meteorito, llamada kriptonita, podemos hacer lo mismo para amortiguar a Supergirl-. -No me parece, quiero exterminarla con mi propia magia, usando bastante energía de esta esfera, tendré otro método– rehusó Selena –además, si a ese joven jardinero lo llevaron al hospital de Smallville, pues allá estaremos y a él lo convenceré para que sea mío y de nadie más -. Después de vencer al monstruo, Kara pensó caminando en el pasillo: \"¿Quién está detrás de todos esos sucesos? ¿Acaso ese alguien está manipulando la energía del Omegahedron para conseguir sus propios planes?\". Cuando la hermosa joven llegaba a la entrada de las habitaciones, olvidando que debía entrar como estudiante, la señora Murphy se percató desde el cuarto en donde estaba viendo la televisión. -¡Vaya! Señorita, usted no es alumna de este colegio, ¿qué estás haciendo por acá a estas horas de la noche?-. Kara se asustó y recordó. -Pues verás, lo que pasa es que yo…-. -Y viene con este atuendo tan sensual, ¿acaso hoy es día de disfraces? Por lo menos, deberías venir bien vestida y no con esos trapos- la señora interrumpió seria. -Perdóname señora, no volveré a cometer imprudencias en venir a estas horas de esta manera– disculpó apenada Kara. -Puedes entrar, pero la próxima vez no vengas con esos trapos tan ridículos, ¿acaso se cree familiar de Superman?-. \"Sí, soy su prima…\" pensó Kara, quien se tapó el escudo de su pecho con su mano derecha, yendo rápidamente hacia su habitación. Mientras Kara se cambió para vestirse como Linda, Selena analizó sobre la energía del Omegahedron de manera cuidadosa durante toda la noche. Una hora después, Linda consideró decepcionada por no encontrar el Omegahedron. Sentada en su cama antes de dormir empezó a recapacitar, sacó la pulsera de su mano izquierda tirándola contra el suelo, sintiéndose resignada por que era imposible encontrar la fuerza energética. Sin embargo, en el momento que quería acostar la pulsera brilló, en ese momento, Linda escuchó que alguien la llamaba: \"Kara, ¿estás ahí? Necesitamos que nos puedas responder…\". Linda pensó que era un sueño, aunque, el segundo llamado la despertó al instante: \"Kara por favor, respóndanos…\". Linda echó un vistazo a su pulsera y escuchó las voces de sus padres, cogió la manilla plateada, entró al baño y la colocó en la muñeca de su mano izquierda. -¿Mamá? ¿Papá?– tras averiguar, el brazalete resplandeció, proyectando el haz de luz al espejo del baño. El aspecto de Linda se transformó al semblante de Kara. -Si hija, somos nosotros… La situación por acá empeora poco a poco, estamos respirando con bastante dificultad y la energía escasea, por esa razón, todo lo que usamos está paralizado y varios de nosotros estamos enfermos…– las palabras de Zor-El entristeció a su hija. -Kara, sabemos que estás triste por no encontrar el Omegahedron, pero tienes que ser fuerte. Tampoco queremos que te desesperes, sabes muy bien que si te encolerizas, podrías perder la razón y la calma que siempre te caracterizas…- alentó Allura. -¿Pero cómo madre?– Indagó triste Kara –cada vez que la pulsera percibe la energía, lo único que encuentro son monstruos y espectros creados por un ser humano que está usando el Omegahedron -. -Esa persona sabe que estás en el planeta Tierra y te está buscando… - reveló Zor-El –solo para destruirte, pero estamos seguros que puedes derrotar a esa persona y encontrar lo más pronto posible la fuerza energética para traerla de regreso…-. -Ánimo Kara…- incitó Allura –nosotros resistiremos, demuéstrate a ti misma que puedes cumplir con tu misión… sabemos que sí puedes… esfuérzate mi querida Kara… nosotros te acompañaremos siempre, desde el fondo de nuestros corazones…-. Luego de ver a sus padres, el resplandor reflejado en el espejo se desvaneció, la hermosa joven se tranquilizó, tomó un respiro y miró al espejo. -Tengo que lograr, estoy segura que todo va a salir bien, voy a cumplir con mi misión– mirando a la pulsera, recordó a sus padres y a Zaltar – no se preocupen, efectuaré con mi deber, nunca los defraudaré-. Dicho eso, Kara salió del baño y se acostó en la cama, pensando en lo que hará en el siguiente día, sin embargo, pensó: \"Aunque antes, visitaré por la mañana a Ethan en el hospital, como Linda, después de eso, continuaré averiguando sobre el Omegahedron\".

Comenzando el siguiente día, a las horas de la mañana, Lucy visitó de sorpresa al colegio, quería saludar a Linda y saber si no le pasó nada malo después del incidente que ocurrió en Smallville. Cuando llegó hacia las habitaciones, encontró de sorpresa a Linda, quien estaba apenas de salir, vestida de particular. -Hola Linda, ¿cómo estás?– saludó Lucy. -Bien, gracias– respondió pasmada Linda. -¿Dónde estabas cuando ocurrió ayer en Smallville?– preguntó extrañada Lucy. -Lo que pasó es que huí de la hamburguesería, tenía miedo que me pasara algo…- mintió Linda. -¿Por qué? ¿Tenías bastante miedo?– indagó Lucy –Hoy día, todos los jóvenes no tememos ante el peligro-. -Sé que en todo lugar hay peligros, pero la situación de ayer era diferente– Linda siguió desnaturalizando. -Vaya, ¿y no era que habías vivido gran parte de tu vida en Metrópolis? Porque si no me acuerdo, allá pasan cualquier clase de riesgos, todos controlados por Superman… Ahora que lo pienso, ayer no estuvo él, por consiguiente, según lo que me contó Jimmy, cuando yo estaba inconsciente, alguien me salvó…- relató Lucy mientras ambas entraron a la habitación y se sentaron encima de la cama de Lucy - …y según, quien me salvó era una chica, de la misma edad que tenemos nosotras, así mismo, se vestía con un traje similar al de Superman…-. Espera…– interrumpió Linda –se supone que Superman era el único sobreviviente del planeta Kriptón, ¿o me equivoco?-. -Si Linda, pero lo que me refirió Jimmy es cierto, creo que hay más sobrevivientes del planeta de donde vino Superman-. -¿Y qué trama con ello? – inquirió Linda. -No lo sé, pero Jimmy está indagando sobre todo lo acontecido ayer, por eso él está en el hospital para averiguar con los heridos del accidente– la contestación de Lucy no gustó a Linda, no obstante, ella estaba atenta –y creo que va a indagar al joven que estuvo atrapado en la máquina y rescatado por la extraña chica-. -¿Será que podremos acompañar a Jimmy?– curioseó Linda. -Claro, me imagino que para eso te alistabas– manifestó Lucy. -Pues estoy lista– dijo Linda. -¿Y entonces qué esperamos? Vamos– expresó Lucy, ambas se levantaron y salieron de la habitación. Saliendo de la puerta del edificio, se sorprendieron que en los alrededores estaba el director Danvers dialogando con la señora Murphy sobre la situación deteriorada de lo que sobrevino: varios postes destrozados, la malla rota, los autos destruidos, el muro deteriorado y la calle desordenada con tanta tierra y basura. -Buenos días director Danvers, ¿qué pasó por acá?- examinó Linda. -No lo sé señorita, pero ocurrió algo, de igual manera, la señora Murphy no sabe nada, ¿usted sabe algo sobre esto?– interrogó el director. -La verdad es que me asusté porque hubo una gran tormenta, seguramente eso pasó– falseó Linda. -También me acuerdo que, a esas horas de la noche, vino una joven vestida con un traje de Superman y me explicó que vino para visitarte, señorita Danvers– relató seria la señora Murphy. -Sí, es cierto…- contestó Linda – lo que ocurrió es que ella era amiga mía, además vino confundida, vive en Metrópolis, es una fanática de Superman y quiere hacer sus cosas, ilusionada que podía hacerlo -. -Pero un momento…- aguardó Lucy -¿esa chica no era la misma que me salvó aquella vez por la tarde en Smallville?-. -En realidad no lo sé Lucy… - mintió Linda con disimulo –lo que si estoy segura es que estas situaciones son muy sospechosas-. -Por esa razón, queremos visitar al hospital, porque nos enteramos que el joven jardinero era uno de los heridos de aquella tarde– indicó Lucy. -Perfecto señoritas, entonces examinaré para la reparación de todos los daños, nos veremos en clase pasado mañana– despidió el director Danvers y ambas compañeras caminaron directamente al hospital. En una habitación de hospitalizados, Jimmy habló con Ethan sobre lo ocurrido aquella tarde. El joven no recordaba de lo que pasó en la casa de Selena, mucho menos de los problemas que transitó en plena calle del municipio. -Entonces, ¿solamente vio un monstruo que lo atrapó?– interrogó Jimmy. -Si, eso es lo que recuerdo…– reconoció Ethan, sentado sobre la cama -asimismo, cuando me atrapó sentía muchos mareos, hasta me quedé dormido atrapado; de repente, alguien abrió la boca, era la chica más hermosa del mundo, tiene cabello rubio, largo y lizo, ojos azules profundos como el cielo, labios de color rojo carmesí y rostro angelical; era un ángel quien me liberó del monstruo-. -Interesante…– escribió Jimmy en su cuaderno de apuntes –pero, ¿usted alcanzó a ver el traje que traía aquella joven?-. -Si… portaba un traje azul con capa roja, eso era lo único que recuerdo– reveló Ethan – igualmente, si quieres, puedo esbozar un retrato de ella-. -¿Eres dibujante profesional?– curioseó Jimmy. -Profesional no lo soy, aún cuando soy un pintor empírico, ya que la pintura es uno de mis pasatiempos– confesó sonriente Ethan. -Me parece bueno– Jimmy prestó su cuaderno y su lápiz a Ethan, quien comenzó a trazar el rostro de su salvadora. Lucy y Linda llegaron al hospital, preguntando por la habitación donde estaba Ethan. -El paciente está recibiendo una visita, si quieren verlo, tendrán que esperar su turno– señaló la enfermera que estaba en la recepción. Ambas señoritas se sentaron en la sala de espera. Pasando más de una hora, Jimmy salió de la habitación, llegando hacia la sala de espera donde halló a sus amigas. -Hola, ¿cómo están?– saludó Jimmy. -Bien Jimmy– contestó Lucy –cuéntanos ¿cómo está el joven jardinero?-. -Está mucho mejor, el médico me dijo que solamente sufrió de algunos golpes leves, seguramente lo darán de alta a las horas de la tarde– respondió el camarógrafo. -¿Habló con Ethan?– preguntó Linda. -Sí, él me contó lo transcurrido, me dijo que estaba en la casa de una señorita, de nombre Selena, pero después se sentía mal– detalló Jimmy –después de eso no recordó nada-. -¿Expresó algo más?– insistió Linda. -Veo que estás muy interesada de ese joven, Linda…- apuntó en voz baja Lucy y Linda se apenó un poco. -Si– respondió Jimmy –expuso que era rescatado por aquella chica, a quien yo la vi también, me sorprende que Ethan dibujó un retrato de ella, aquí me dejó el bosquejo– y mostró el retrato dibujado. Linda miró detalladamente el dibujo y se alegró en el fondo. \"Sinceramente no sabía que Ethan me plasmó bien, con eso el siente algo por mí\" pensó contenta la joven, mientras Lucy y Jimmy continuaban dialogando. -¿Será posible ver al joven para hablar con él?– inquirió Linda. -Por supuesto, puedes hablar con la recepción y le dirán en dónde queda la habitación– indicó Jimmy. Linda fue a la recepción en solicitar entrar a ver a Ethan, la dejaron entrar y circuló hacia la habitación donde estaba Ethan. El joven, al ver ingresar a Linda sonrió. -Hola Linda– saludó Ethan. -Hola…- tras simple ver y escuchar a Ethan, sentía que estaba enamorada, por lo tanto, manifestó de manera tímida -…escuché que sentiste un percance, ¿cómo estás?-. -Estoy bien, gracias por preocuparme– respondió el joven. -Espero que te recuperes pronto… porque la verdad… quiero que termines con los arreglos de los jardines del colegio– reveló timoratamente Linda –quisiera hacerte una cuestión, ¿es cierto que distinguió a una hermosa chica, quien te salvó? -. -¿Cómo se enteró?– interrogó sorprendido Ethan -¿supo también lo ocurrido ayer?-. -Si lo supe, además, Jimmy me contó de lo sucedido y me mostró un retrato que dibujaste sobre ella– respondió Linda. -Esa hermosa chica me cautivó, puedo decir que me enamoré perdidamente de ella– esas palabras de Ethan le latía más el corazón a Linda, aunque ella contuvo sus sentimientos, tomando un respiro. -Qué bueno…- expresó Linda. -Cómo me encantaría volver a verla y declararle mi amor– manifestó ilusionado Ethan, Linda también quería expresar, sin embargo, tuvo que aguantar para ocultar su secreto. -¿Pero cómo es posible Ethan?, ya has visto un día a esa chica y ahora ¿le declaras el amor así de simple? ¿No será que exageras?– cuestionó Linda, presumiendo que estaba enojada. -Puede ser, pero Linda, tienes que saber que nunca me he enamorado de una joven tan especial como ella, sé que es diferente a cualquier mujer del mundo, de lo anteriormente dicho, si encuentras a ese ser amado te darás cuenta que sentirás lo mismo, como yo siento por ella-. La respuesta de Ethan facilitó cierto valor a Linda, quien especuló: \"Ethan, yo también siento lo mismo por ti, revelaría mi identidad, pero no puedo hacer…\". -¿Qué piensas Linda?– indagó Ethan. -Nada, es sobre mis estudios que debo hacer– mintió Linda –bueno, vine a saber cómo estabas, espero que te recuperes lo más pronto posible, estoy segura que aquella chica también sienta algo por ti-. -Linda, gracias por visitarme y por sus palabras, las tendré en cuenta– al momento de que Ethan agradecía, Linda se despidió de él y se fue directamente hacia la sala de espera. Sin embargo, cuando caminaba por el pasillo del hospital, la joven sintió la energía del Omegahedron, revisó la pulsera de su mano izquierda, vio que resplandecía cada vez con más fuerza, asomó frente la ventana del hospital y miró que llegaba el mismo auto que lo distinguió aquella vez en el colegio. Del auto se bajaron dos mujeres, una de ellas llevaba un extraño cofre negro en su bolso. \"Estoy segura que esa señora lleva el Omegahedron, tendré que estar alerta y cuidadosa, para saber en cómo recuperar el Omegahedron\" pensó Linda. Selena y Bianca llegaron a la sala de espera y hablaron con la enfermera jefe en recepción. -Buenos días enfermera, queremos saber en cuál habitación está hospitalizado un joven, quien sufrió el percance de ayer– saludó Bianca. Selena apreció que el cofre se movía bruscamente, sin enterar que Linda llegaba a la sala de espera, no obstante, cuando trató de controlarlo, se colisionó con Lucy, quien esperaba a Linda. -Fíjese para dónde va jovencita…- insinuó enojada Selena. -Perdóname señora…- disculpó Lucy. -Ninguna señora, señorita– refunfuñó Selena en voz alta, Jimmy intervino para controlar la discusión. -Perdona a Lucy, esperamos no tener inconvenientes – disculpó Jimmy, Selena se movió media vuelta y caminó junto con Bianca sin decir una sola palabra de respuesta al joven camarógrafo. Cuando la enfermera avisó a Bianca para poder ingresar, Selena estuvo pendiente. -Ya tienes el permiso, espero que puedas convencer a aquel joven– habló Bianca a Selena. Selena caminó hacia la habitación donde estaba Ethan, en ese instante, Linda halló a Lucy y a Jimmy. -¿Quiénes son esas señoras?– preguntó Linda. -No lo sé…– respondió Jimmy. -Pero esa \"señorita\" es bastante grosera, no sabe disculpar– expresó indignada Lucy. -Temo que esas señoras traman algo raro– sospechó Linda, ocultando la verdad. -Es cierto, se ven muy raras, pero cuéntame Linda ¿cómo te fue con Ethan?– examinó Jimmy. -Bien…- Linda usó su visión de rayos x entre los muros del hospital, para notar a Selena quien caminaba por el pasillo –solo espero que le den de alta, está alentado… ahora bien, él quiere volver a conocer a aquella chica, ya que me dijo que está enamorado de ella, yo creo que él está loco-. -Bueno, ¿qué podemos hacer con Ethan?, enamorado de una salvadora a quien no la conoce con exactitud, lástima que esa salvadora no fuera yo…– comentó Lucy, no obstante, Jimmy interrumpió. -Ahora vas a decir que tengo la culpa de que estés enamorada de Ethan-. -Para nada Jimmy, sabes muy bien que te quiero mucho– dispensó Lucy. -Muchachos, es mejor que estemos pendientes de esas señoras, porque hay algo que no me gusta - exhortó Linda. -Si quieren, averiguo sobre aquella señora quien entró, por lo tanto, no pierdan de vista a la otra señora– indicó Jimmy, quien fue tras Selena. Selena pasó por el pasillo de las habitaciones del hospital, encontró la habitación en donde estaba Ethan, quien al saber que entró la mujer, se enojó. -Se puede saber ¿usted qué está haciendo acá?– inquirió Ethan. -Solamente vine a verte, porque tenemos algo pendiente… - manifestó sonriente Selena. -No quiero hablar con usted– negó Ethan –si no me acuerdo, usted me dio algo que casi agonizo-. -Eso no es cierto Ethan– falseó Selena en tono suave –lo que quiero decirte es que estoy enamorada de ti, asimismo, lo hice porque quiero ofrecerte más de lo que tienes-. -No me incumbe sus caprichos– alegó Ethan –prefiero vivir y ser como soy, de tal manera que, estoy enamorado de una chica angelical y no de una que tiene cierto parecido a una arpía-. -¿Me dijiste arpía?– sonsacó altanera Selena, quien se levantó de la cama –ahora verás cómo soy yo cuando alguien no me quiere-. Moviendo de manera firme su mano derecha, cerró la puerta de la habitación de aparatosamente; en ese mismo momento, Ethan saltó rápidamente de la cama y Selena jugueteó con él, quien en seguida la empujó, golpeándola contra el suelo, corriendo hacia la puerta. Al escuchar aquellos ruidos, todos en el hospital se alarmaron, en seguida, varias enfermeras y médicos averiguaron qué estaba ocurriendo; encontraron a Ethan y lo atraparon, de repente apareció Selena, quien formó un hechizo usando el cofre negro. Linda se percató, circuló por el pasillo y echó un vistazo. Se alarmó cuando todos los aparatos flotaron directamente hacia quienes estaban en el hospital; pronto fue hacia la sala de espera, revelando a todos: -¡Salgan todos! ¡Es urgente!– Lucy, Jimmy y todos los demás salieron desconfiados hacia la puerta de salida del hospital, seguidamente Linda fue con ellos, quien por su parte, no podía intervenir en frente de todos como Supergirl. Tras escuchar los fuertes golpes y estruendos, todos cayeron al suelo, llegando a la calle. -Pongan atención lo que les digo, quédense aquí y no hagan nada, yo estaré cerca tomando las fotos de este acaecimiento– advirtió Jimmy, quien alistó su cámara. -Pero podrías lastimarte– insinuó preocupada Lucy. -Tranquila Lucy, sé cuidarme solo, lástima que no esté Superman para ayudarnos– al expresar, Jimmy fue hacia una de las esquinas del hospital. Dentro del lugar, Ethan corrió por las escaleras, huyendo de una máquina de electrocardiograma controlado por el hechizo de Selena. -Es mejor que no huyas, sé que esto no te gusta Ethan, pero es lo que deseas– insinuó la mujer, concentrada en su brujería. La máquina casi alcanzó a Ethan cuando él llegó a la terraza del hospital, cerrando la puerta para que no avanzara la máquina, aunque ésta la rompió en un santiamén. Linda y Lucy miraron lo que ocurría en la terraza, donde Ethan no podía mover, sitiado en la esquina de la terraza por la máquina. Linda escuchaba en sus oídos lo que sobrevenía. -No aceptaré sus pretensiones– rehusó Ethan, tratando de salir de esa situación. -Lo aceptarás, porque estás bajo mis condiciones– alegó Selena, saliendo de la puerta. La hechicera movió su mano derecha para que la máquina avanzara rápidamente hacia Ethan, por su parte Linda no resistió ver la situación y de manera disimulada, sin avisar a Lucy, corrió velozmente; encontró una tapa de alcantarilla, la sacó ligeramente y se bajó saltando. Dentro de los conductos de la alcantarilla la chica se convirtió avivadamente en Supergirl, llegando hacia la otra tapa de la alcantarilla que quedaba al otro lado del hospital, de ahí, salió volando sin que nadie la distinguiera. Ethan eludió de la máquina que partía por encima, pero ésta cayó a donde estaba Jimmy. -¡Cuidado Jimmy!– gritó asustada Lucy. A pesar de la caída del aparato, alguien voló rápidamente para cogerlo, salvando la vida de Jimmy y sorprendiendo a las miradas de la gente que estaba alrededor del hospital. Jimmy no podía creer, era la misma chica a quien vio el día anterior. Al bajar la máquina en un lugar seguro, sacó al joven rápidamente de aquella esquina del hospital y lo dejó donde estaban Lucy y los demás. -Gracias…- agradeció estupefacto Jimmy. Todos se sorprendieron sobre la presencia de Supergirl, quien miró hacia la terraza, en donde Selena acosaba con su magia a Ethan. -Esto no es bueno…- señaló Kara, quien después miró a todos –Jimmy está bien, solo les pido que se alejen de este lugar, yo me encargo de esta situación–. Dicho eso, Kara se elevó de forma supersónica hacia la terraza, derribando a Selena contra el suelo de la terraza y sacó a Ethan con sus brazos, lejos de la bruja. -Eres tú, mi amor– susurró Ethan. -Vine a salvarte, de nuevo– confesó Kara –es mejor que te lleve a un lugar seguro, ¡Sujétate!– y lo llevó en dirección al occidente. Selena, al levantarse del suelo y viendo que no estaba Ethan, buscó a Bianca, quien llegó a la terraza. -Debemos que seguir a esa chiquilla, ella sacó a Ethan de mis manos– avisó enojada Selena. -Pero vendrá la policía en arrestarnos– advirtió Bianca. -No me importa si me busca la policía, el FBI, la CIA o el ejército– negó enojada Selena -debemos que desaparecer sin levantar sospechas, vámonos a casa, allá analizaré en cómo destruir a Supergirl y recuperar a Ethan-. Los policías y los guardias de seguridad llegaron minutos después a la terraza, hallando que no había nadie; por lo tanto, no encontraron evidencias ni rastros de los causantes del pánico a todo el hospital. Abajo, en la calle todo volvió a normalidad, no obstante, Lucy buscaba por todos lados a Linda -¡Linda! ¿Dónde estás?– vociferó por todos lados junto con Jimmy, quien hizo seña con la cabeza de no encontrarla. -Lo que me parece raro es que aquella chica, mejor dicho Supergirl, nos haya salvado la vida– analizó Jimmy. -Si…- respondió Lucy pensativa –además Linda se desapareció, ella nunca me avisó cuando salió-. -Eso también pasa a Clark, cuando Superman apareció él no estaba, que coincidencia, pero no creo que haya más allá de ello– apuntó pensando Jimmy –lo importante es que estamos a salvo, además, toca investigar sobre estos sucesos, que con mayor gravedad están atravesando, creo que todo eso ocurre cuando esas dos misteriosas mujeres causaron todo lo que está pasando en estos últimos días, llamaré a Lois para que me ayude en esta investigación– con ello, Jimmy y Lucy continuaron buscando a Linda. Dos horas después, ambos jóvenes se fueron hacia la casa de la familia Lein, para avisar a Lois por vía telefónica sobre ese caso. Escrito inicialmente el día miércoles, 10 de febrero de 2010.

Por su lado, Kara tenía que buscar algún sitio seguro para dejar salvo al joven. -¿Por qué no vamos a un lugar para compartir juntos?– la pregunta de Ethan sacó la preocupación de Kara. -Porque es peligroso, seguramente esa mujer puede causarte más daño– expresó Kara. -Es mejor que descansemos allá– Ethan señaló un abandonado parque de diversiones– además amor mío, deberíamos que presentar y conocernos un poco– a Kara le sonó la idea, llevando a Ethan hacia aquel parque abandonado, donde miraba por todos lados. -Bueno, pero podemos estar poco tiempo– comentó Kara, mientras Ethan la miraba con ternura. -¿Quieres sentarte conmigo para que charlemos?– el jardinero sugirió y la kriptoniana aceptó, por lo tanto, ambos se sentaron al frente de un carrusel. -¿Quiero saber cómo te llamas? para recordarte siempre el resto mi vida– interrogó Ethan. -Me llamo Kara– respondió. -Kara… ¿De dónde vienes?–. -Vengo de Argos City, en verdad no estaré tanto tiempo por acá, debo recuperar algo muy importante para regresar a Argos City, si no lo hago, seguramente todos los habitantes, incluyendo mis padres, morirán– confesó Kara. -Entiendo…- Ethan sentía algo de frustración –sin embargo, podré ayudarte en la búsqueda-. -Es difícil…– reconoció Kara –pero agradezco tu interés-. -Me llamo Ethan, vivo acá en Smallville, soy jardinero y aspiro a ser un empresario en la floricultura. Seré sincero contigo: nunca he visto a una chica tan hermosa como tú– eso dejó sorprendida a Kara -…además, estoy perdidamente enamorado de ti y quiero estar contigo durante el resto de nuestras vidas-. -Me dejas sin palabras Ethan…- contestó tímida Kara –yo también siento algo por ti, pero prefiero no mostrarte este sentimiento, por ello, es la primera vez que siento algo tan raro y tan diferente, dado que, no es lo mismo sentir por el cariño que tengo hacia mis padres-. -Hermosa Kara…- dijo Ethan en tono suave –es cierto que vivimos en mundos diferentes, no obstante, nunca debe ser un impedimento para demostrar nuestro amor-. -Estás completamente loco Ethan…- comentó Kara, disimulando su sonrisa –asimismo, si estas situaciones no pasaran, yo no estaría por acá-. -Pero ocurre y estás aquí conmigo, inclusive, podemos formar nuestra familia cuando regreses– instó Ethan, convenciendo para que Kara aceptara. -No me entiendes Ethan…- alegó Supergirl –dudo mucho en volver, además, si regreso nos olvidaríamos-. -Eso no será cierto…- refutó Ethan –porque estoy seguro que regresarás-. Mientras continuaban conversando Kara y Ethan, ambos fueron encontrados por Selena, quien llevaba consigo al Omegahedron en frente del gran espejo de su casa. -¡Los encontré!– exclamó en voz alta Selena. -Pues vámonos para allá- apuntó Bianca. -Tengo que impedir que se enamoren otra vez– dicho eso, Selena manipuló el Omegahedron para que tele-transportaran rumbo al antiguo parque de diversiones. En el momento que Ethan convencía a Kara para que se enamoraran y se besaran de nuevo, la pulsera de Kara resplandeció con gran fuerza. -¿Qué pasa mi amor?– preguntó Ethan. -Percibo una energía que viene hasta acá– respondió Kara, mirando por todos lados. -¿A qué te refieres?– Ethan no entendió. -¡Qué escena tan romántica!– exclamó de manera seca Selena, sorprendiendo a la pareja, quienes miraron para atrás –lamento interrumpir su momento, pero ahora es mi turno-. -Kara, es mejor que no vayas, seguramente te tiene una trampa– advirtió Ethan. -Tranquilo Ethan, sé cuidarme sola– al decirlo, Kara se levantó y caminó hacia Selena, advirtiendo a Ethan –solo quiero que huyas, porque esto va a ser peligroso-. -Será imposible para él– indicando, Selena cogió su artefacto oscuro como báculo, sacando a Ethan de donde estaba y al instante lo llevó en donde estaban los carros chocones, haciendo enojar a Kara. -¿Quién es usted?– interrogó. -Me llamo Selena, seré la dueña de este mundo y tú chiquilla haz cogido algo que me pertenece– contestó. -Para su información no soy ninguna chiquilla, me llamo Kara, vengo de Argos City, no solo para recuperar algo que pertenece a la ciudad, sino también para dejar claro que dejes en paz la vida de Ethan– expuso enfurecida Kara. -Si no te das cuenta, esta poderosa esfera me pertenece, con ella te puedo vencer, ¿acaso tienes miedo de mi magia?– retó Selena. -No le tengo miedo, además, lo que tienes no es suyo, es el Omegahedron, una fuerza energética proveniente de Argos City y del cual es necesaria para ellos, por eso vine– reveló Kara. -Ya verás lo que hago con Ethan– dicho ello, Selena movió con sus manos para realizar un conjuro, haciendo prender los coches al instante para ir directamente a Ethan y golpearlo, él se levantó rápidamente y los esquivaba para no dejar. Kara fue a donde estaba Ethan, pero Selena, de manera astuta, se multiplicó para formar un muro humano en forma de círculo, lanzando energías para debilitar a Kara con su báculo oscuro. Inicialmente lo lograba, no obstante, poco a poco Supergirl los detuvo. Cuando vio a un Ethan resignado y fatigado de eludir de los coches y montando en uno de ellos, para que los demás coches se lanzaran hacia él; Kara saltó bastante alto, saliendo del círculo formado, inmediatamente, viendo unas varas de metal, los cogió y con gran agilidad las lanzó directamente hacia Selena, quien se sorprendió en estar atrapada por un círculo de varas paradas alrededor de ella. Después Kara saltó rápidamente a donde estaba Ethan, quien no sabía qué hacer con la estampida de los coches. Supergirl llegó rápidamente al lugar y viendo que se acercaran azarosamente los coches, alzó fuerte el coche en donde estaba montado Ethan y voló, cargando el coche, rompiendo la carpa, dejando inconsciente a Ethan, llevándolo en dirección al sur con gran velocidad hacia un lugar tranquilo y fuera de peligro. Bianca se acercó a Selena y preguntó: -¿Cómo vas a deshacer de las varas?-. Enfurecida, Selena recitó un conjuro y las varas se doblaron. -Estoy completamente furiosa, voy de una vez para eliminar a Supergirl-. A las horas de la tarde, Kara llevó al coche directo a las orillas del río, en ese instante, Ethan despertó durante el vuelo. -¿Qué pasó mi amor?– indagó Ethan. -Recibiste un golpe y desmayaste, pero ya estás bien– respondió Kara –ahora estamos lejos de Smallville, inclusive lejos de Metrópolis-. -¿Bastante lejos?– inquirió Ethan. -Sí…- manifestó Kara –pero si quieres, te bajo hacia las orillas del río-. -Por favor Kara…- pidió Ethan y Kara lo bajó a donde estaba una playa amplia, dejando el coche. -Kara, es importante que platiquemos– propuso Ethan. -¿Es algo de lo que habíamos hablado?– averiguó Kara -¿o al menos entendiste?-. -Creo que si– reconoció serio Ethan –mira, seré sincero y espero que tú me entiendas…- pese a lo que iba a escuchar, Kara miró que desde una palmera a lo lejos salió lanzado un coco hacia Ethan, golpeándolo detrás de la cabeza, cayendo inconsciente al piso. -¿Ethan? ¡Ethan!– tras verlo caer, Kara lo recogió y trató de reanimarlo, pero Ethan no respondió, aunque tenga intactos sus signos vitales. El coco fue movido por la magia de Selena para evitar que Supergirl fuera más lejos con Ethan. Kara acostó a Ethan en el coche, cogió el coco partido, lo probó, y luego pasó el agua de coco cuidadosamente a los labios de Ethan con sus dedos. Mientras tanto, Nigel llegaba enojado a la casa de Selena, reclamando por aquella esfera. -Selena, ya colmó mi paciencia contigo, es mejor que me entregues la esfera de poder de una vez por todas– obligó enojado Nigel. -¿Sabes? – Selena eludió ante la insistencia de Nigel –Te propongo algo… ¿por qué no me ayudas a sacar al joven jardinero para continuar con mis planes? Si me ayudas, te daré el Omegahedron y estaremos a mano-. -¿Me ofreces el objeto mágico a cambio de sacar a ese simple conejillo de indias?– dudó Nigel -¿Con qué fin?-. -Con el fin de obtener lo que siempre he deseado: poder, riquezas y obediencia de todos los habitantes de la Tierra; recuerde que Superman no está, solamente está un simple estorbo de esa Supergirl, por lo tanto, estoy segura que si lo solucionamos podré sacarla de mi camino– respondió Selena, convenciendo a Nigel. -Bien, te ayudo en lo que pides, espero que cumplas con nuestro trato– y sacando una araña de la cáscara de nuez, hizo que Ethan se despertara de repente. -¿Dónde estoy?– preguntó Ethan cogiendo su cabeza con sus manos. -Estás aquí, conmigo– respondió Kara, a quien Ethan la miraba. -¿Qué me pasó?– examinó Ethan. -Te cayó un coco en la cabeza– reveló Kara. -Kara, ¿será que puedo pedirte un favor?– indagó Ethan. -Dime-. -Te pido que me lleves de regreso a Smallville, porque no quiero esconderme– apuntó serio Ethan. -Pero es peligroso, igualmente, no sabemos que estará planeando Selena– negó preocupada Kara –ella puede tramar algo y estaríamos cayendo en una trampa, por esa razón, tengo que impedir que ella adelante sus planes-. -Si eso es lo que vas hacer, perfecto, pero quiero regresar– insistió Ethan. Kara miró su pulsera que respandecía, mientras Ethan emprendió a caminar, alejando de ella, quien se enojó. -¡Hey, Ethan!– Kara brincó un gran salto por encima de Ethan, lo alcanzó y se paró de frente –Espera un momento, tengo que decir que…-. -Has saltado increíblemente sobre mi cabeza, es ¿real o alucinación?– interrumpió curioseando Ethan. -Es real– respondió Kara. -Entonces, todo lo que haces en salvarme demuestra que eres familiar de Superman, ¿cierto?– preguntó Ethan. -Es cierto, soy la prima de Superman– contestó Kara. -Además de todo, ¿puedes ver a través de paredes y objetos brindados?– siguió interrogando Ethan. -Si– respondió sonriente Kara. -¿Y doblas elementos de acero?– indagó Ethan. -Si- respondió Kara en tono grueso. -¡Vaya!– exclamó Ethan –nunca me imaginé encontrarme con una verdadera superheroína-. -Mire Ethan– expuso Kara –tengo que ir por Selena y recuperar el Omegahedron, antes que ella te capture-. -No me hagas enojar de nuevo– negó serio Ethan. -Por favor, confía en mí– para tranquilizarlo, Supergirl se acercó de frente –además, siempre me has pedido que yo exprese mis sentimientos hacia ti y voy a responder de una vez tu petición– Kara se acercó más a Ethan, poco a poco sus labios tocaron son suavidad con las del joven, besándolo de una manera romántica, con ello, ambos se olvidaron de todo lo que les rodeaban. El beso era largo y cuidadoso, en el cual, Kara expresaba sus sentimientos. Por su lado, Selena y Nigel preparaban un hechizo, Nigel cogió la vara oscura y Selena el Omegahedron, ambos los acercaron hacia el gran espejo. En ese instante, la esfera se movió, surgiendo una gran energía. Terminado el beso, Ethan se sintió más tranquilo. -Oh Kara, definitivamente me amas– expresó Ethan en tono suave. -Si, te amo Ethan, es mi sentimiento que siento hacia ti– manifestó en tono dulce Kara. En el momento que ambos se acercaron de nuevo para dar otro beso, Ethan desapareció. El hechizo surtió efecto, Ethan apareció sobre la cama del dormitorio de Selena, encadenado y con la mente en blanco. -¡Qué maravilla, lo hicieron muy bien!– exclamó Bianca. -Bueno Selena, cumplí mi parte, ahora debes cumplir tu parte– exigió Nigel. -Claro, además soy tuya, pero antes, quiero mostrarte algo de lo que aprendí– tras decir, Selena cogió el Omegahedron y con la vara oscura los extendió hacia Nigel, recitando un conjuro para envejecerlo, dejándolo sin fuerzas. -Bianca, lleva a Nigel y métalo entre las rejas, de tal manera que, no me sirve para nada– ordenó Selena y Bianca llevó a Nigel, quien miró a la bruja. \"Que astuta eres, me traicionas, que desilusión…\" pensó Nigel \"pero estoy seguro que sus caprichos no van a durar mucho…\". Cuando Kara abrió sus ojos, se sorprendió que Ethan desapareciera, miró y buscó por todos lados de la orilla. -¿Ethan? ¿Ethan?-. Miró su pulsera, sintiendo cada vez más fuerte la energía, \"Ethan desapareció, pero estoy segura de quién lo hizo…\" especuló, emprendiendo su vuelo con velocidad supersónica directamente a Smallville. Lo que Kara no sabía era que Selena le tendía una peligrosa trampa. Escrito inicialmente el martes, 16 de febrero de 2010. Editado para el Sitio Bagatela: jueves 7 de octubre de 2010.

Tercera corrección: lunes, 15 de septiembre de 2014.[Chapter 9] PRIMER FANFIC: SUPERGIRL Y LA FUERZA ENERGÉTICA NOVENO CAPÍTULO: ZONA FANTASMA Después de capturar a Ethan, Selena decidió en coger desde el gran espejo de su casa a varios líderes, entre ellos presidentes y primeros ministros de los importantes países del mundo, quienes se reunieron en la Asamblea Anual de las Naciones Unidas; conjurando un hechizo al secretario de las Naciones Unidas y a los gobernantes de USA, Reino Unido, Japón, Francia, México, Alemania, China, Brasil y Sudáfrica; el acaecimiento causó pánico y hermetismo a todos los asistentes, preguntando por aquellos gobernantes. Minutos después, en uno de los grandes televisores que fueron instalados para la transmisión de la Asamblea, la señal fue interrumpida por la imagen de Selena. \"Estimados señores, sé que ustedes quieren definir un nuevo rumbo para este planeta, para ello, sin la presencia de Superman convenceré a los presidentes de los importantes países del mundo y al Secretario de las Naciones Unidas, en una idea que les van a encantar. Me refiero que, de ahora en adelante, yo misma regiré los destinos de la Tierra. Si alguien se opone, sufrirá las consecuencias…\" Las crudas palabras de Selena generó miedo a todos los delegados, quienes sin tener solución diferente aceptaron de manera unánime el nuevo mandato de Selena, quien añadió: \"para concluir, levantaré la única sede de mi gobierno, que consta de un majestuoso castillo, ubicado en la carretera entre la ciudad de Metrópolis y el poblado de Smallville, en el antiguo país de los Estados Unidos\". La declaración generó incertidumbre y desesperación a todos los habitantes de la Tierra. En la sede del Pentágono, Bianca apareció en cuerpo presente, a escondidas de las autoridades, para ingresar en una cafetería y en una cocina, siendo así, a los jugos y gaseosas agregó la pócima que preparó Selena, dichas bebidas fueron tomadas por los altos mandos militares minutos después, como si nada pasara; más adelante, ellos fueron cegados por los efectos de la pócima y fueron atraídos por las órdenes de Selena. Una de ellas era cerrar todas las sedes de los gobiernos de cada país, en seguida, ordenó enviar un gran batallón de tropas para custodiar hacia su casa afueras de Smallville; allá usó el Omegahedron para formar un gran temblor de tierra, destruyendo varias averías entre los conductos de luz, la carretera y los cultivos que estaban alrededor, creando una gran montaña, cuya cima formó un majestuoso castillo rocoso resistente. Todos los presentes se sorprendieron y se preguntaron: ¿por qué los dirigentes y líderes mundiales cedieron los poderes gubernamentales ante esa desconocida mujer? A las horas de la tarde, los curiosos no sabían que Supergirl llegaba en velocidad supersónica, directamente hacia el castillo. Allá entró en el gran portón, miró todos los monumentos y estatuas de figuras de monstruos, muebles dorados y lugares llenos de riquezas, provenientes de cualquier lugar del mundo. La chica de acero buscaba a Ethan, no obstante, echó un vistazo a unos personajes encerrados entre las rejas. Eran los presidentes, los primeros ministros, los líderes mundiales y el Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas. -¿Ustedes fueron capturados por Selena?– preguntó Supergirl. -Sí, esa señora por capricho se tomó el poder de gobernar a la Tierra– respondió el presidente de Francia. -Un momento señorita, ¿usted viene con el traje de Superman?– dudó el presidente de los Estados Unidos. -Sí, como mi primo está en una tarea encomendada por ustedes, aquí estoy, cumpliendo otra misión, que se supone es confidencial– la contestación de Supergirl dejó escépticos a todos los encarcelados, quienes siempre confiaron en Superman. -Sé que ustedes no confían en mí, a pesar de esto, les pido su confianza, porque tengo una pronta solución para sacarlos de acá– sin embargo, cuando quería romper los barrotes, escuchó el sonido de unas cadenas, se volteó y vio de frente a una persona encadenada por las extremidades -¡Ethan!– gritó ilusionada; Ethan no respondía y Supergirl caminó hacia él –ahora los libro, porque necesito rescatar a alguien especial-. Lo que Supergirl no sabía era que, al acercar a donde estaba Ethan, poco a poco se sintió mal, sus poderes comenzaron a disminuir, al mismo tiempo, sintió fuertes dolores y cayó al suelo. Tratando de echar una mirada arriba, distinguió que hubo un gran campo de energía, dicha energía no era del Omegahedron. -Qué bueno que comparecieras de visita Supergirl, veo que te está pasando lo mismo que a tu primo cuando te expones ante la kriptonita– saludó sonriente Selena. -¿Dónde estás… Selena? – indagó con dificultad Supergirl. -Estoy aquí– Selena apareció al lado izquierdo de donde estaba encadenado Ethan. -¿Qué… me has… hecho?– inquirió débil Supergirl. -Deberías saber que tu punto débil es exponer ante la kriptonita, afortunadamente lo conseguí, ya que soy la emperatriz de este mundo, con medio de la magia creé este campo de energía en frente de Ethan, para demostrar que eres vulnerable–. Paso siguiente, Selena extendió su báculo rompiendo las cadenas que tenía atado Ethan, él la miró fijamente y se acercó para besarla ciegamente sin decir una sola palabra. -No lo hagas… ¡Ethan!– pero los gritos de Kara no llegaron a los oídos de Ethan, cegado por la magia de Selena. Supergirl trataba de alejar del campo de energía, pero no pudía, estaba bastante débil para oponer resistencia. -A propósito, quiero darte un boleto para que vayas a la Zona Fantasma, que llegará en cualquier momento– Selena abrió el techo del castillo, atrajo a un enorme panel, del cual, llegaba hacia la débil Supergirl, en pocos segundos el panel la absorbió –Disfrutes de su prisión Supergirl, por siempre y para siempre-. Dichas las palabras, Selena besó a Ethan y carcajeó. Encerrada en el cristal, la joven kriptoniana lloró y gritó, golpeando al panel que la llevaba fuera de La Tierra en rumbo desconocido, hacia la Zona Fantasma. Cuando el panel llegó a un lugar oscuro, lleno de tierra negra y barro, chocó contra una de las grandes rocas, se rompió y Kara cayó al suelo. Ella se levantó y desesperada trató de volar, pero no podía; luego cogió una roca puntiaguda, trató de romperla presionando su mano izquierda, pero en vez de lograr, su mano se sangró por primera vez, sintiendo un gran dolor. Vio por todos lados y no había nada, solamente oscuridad y soledad, en seguida se arrodilló y lloró amargamente. -¡¿Dónde estoy?!– Kara preguntó llorando, su pulsera resplandeció levemente y llamó a sus padres. –Perdóname… fracasé con mi misión… si no pasaría todo esto, estoy segura que no estaría acá…- de repente la pulsera resplandeció un poco más de intensidad, Kara lo vio con su rostro oscuro y desolador. -Kara… hija…- las voces venían de la pulsera –No te preocupes por lo que pasó… sabemos lo que has hecho… nunca es tarde en rendirte…-. -Madre, perdóname…- expresó Kara, llorando amargamente. -No llores… mi Kara… esos lamentos tuyos y tu manera de rendir no son la solución… vaya a una cueva, seguramente encontrarás a alguien que te ayude en salir de esa zona… Ánimo Kara… todo está en sus manos… - era todo lo que indicó Allura. Kara secó sus lágrimas con sus manos, se levantó y fue en busca de aquella cueva, caminando en forma de zigzag y en pasos lentos sobre las piedras, tratando de no caer. Sin embargo, al momento de acercarse a la cueva, Kara fue vista por un personaje oscuro quien se acercaba. -¡Alto ahí kriptoniana! – vociferó el personaje. -¿Quién eres? – preguntó Kara. -Supongo que eres familiar de la familia El, porque detesto a esa familia – el personaje colérico eludía la pregunta – yo hago las preguntas, ¿eres familiar de Jor-El y de Kal-El? -. -Sí, soy familiar de ambos, pero ¿por qué me preguntas con tanto rencor? – confesó confundida Kara. El personaje se acercó hacia la confundida y asustada joven, luego cogió el brazo derecho con fuerza y después la agarró de los cabellos a Kara, quien gritó amargamente. -Todos los descendientes de Jor-El deben morir, por lo tanto, veo que este es mi momento, si no pude con Kal-El, lo haré contigo – con ello, el personaje tiró a Kara al piso, luego la golpeó y la lanzó hacia un lago de fango y lodo. -¿Quién… eres…? – trató de indagar Kara quien no se movió ni opuso resistencia. -Deberías saber que soy el general Zod y creo que contigo tengo un buen plan para acabar con ese detestable de Kal-El – esas palabras del general Zod hizo recordar algo a Kara, ya que, ella supo que Zod fue derrotado por Kal-El hace algunos años en la Fortaleza de la Soledad. Cuando Zod colocó la cabeza de Kara en el lodo para ahogarla, otro personaje lanzó una piedra hacia la espalda de Zod, quien se volteó adolorido y tiró a Kara al lodo. -General, es mejor que deje a la niña tranquila – advirtió el otro personaje. -Lo conozco… eres otro de los que no se merecen vivir… - desafió furioso Zod. -¿Me conoces? Bien, por lo menos no has cambiado nada en su arruinado aspecto… Es mejor que me entregues la joven – exigió el otro personaje. -¿Y qué harás si no lo hago, Zaltar? – cuestionó un poco sonriente Zod. Zaltar se balanceó hacia Zod, luego, con una roca puntiaguda lo golpeó bastante fuerte en el rostro del general, quien cayó al piso, después lo lanzó al otro lado y cayó inconsciente. -Sufre… - fue la contestación de Zaltar. Al ver a Kara con su rostro boca abajo en el lodo, la sacó con delicadeza y la llevó hacia la cueva. En La Tierra, las tropas del ejército y los comandos de la policía, manipulados por la magia de Selena, controlaban en cada rincón del mundo por la fuerza a las múltiples protestas de rechazo en contra del mandato de Selena. Una de las grandes concentraciones de manifestantes estaba en Metrópolis, donde varios de los manifestantes fueron desplazados de Smallville. El alcalde de Metrópolis, el gobernador de estado y las directivas de The Daily Planet organizaron una fuerte movilización. Entre los manifestantes estaban Lucy, su hermana Lois, Jimmy, George y Helen. Aquella manifestación pacífica era a pie hacia Smallville, estacionando el grupo en las faldas de aquella montaña-castillo, donde estaba Selena. Al observar la manifestación, Selena envió a Bianca para que fuera con un grupo de policías en persuadir a los manifestantes. -Señores, ¿Cuál es el motivo de la manifestación? – preguntó Bianca a los manifestantes. -¿Y cuál será otro motivo que no sea a favor de Selena? – Cuestionó indignada Lois - ¡Es increíble que personas obsesionadas del poder quiten todos nuestros derechos, especialmente, del débil argumento para cerrar todos los medios de comunicación, entre ellos al Daily Planet! -. -¿No están satisfechos de nuestro gobierno? ¿Acaso quieren hablar directamente con ella para que les diera dádivas y beneficios? – indagó Bianca. -No lo estamos, queremos que Selena renuncie inmediatamente, si no lo hace, nosotros iremos a sacarla del poder – manifestó el director Danvers. Todos los manifestantes vinieron por encima de los policías y la situación se volvió más densa; de ahí que, Bianca corrió a donde estaba Selena, quien leía sus libros de hechicería. -Selena – avisó desesperada Bianca – esos manifestantes quieren que renuncies, no están de acuerdo con tu mandato -. -¿En serio? – cuestionó burlona Selena. -Completamente – contestó Bianca. Selena llamó a Ethan y los tres bajaron, montados en un automóvil lujoso. En ese momento, los manifestantes cerraron el paso de salida. -¡Selena, renuncie! – increparon en unísono varias veces los protestantes. -¡Alto! – gritó Selena - ¿Con que ustedes piden que yo renuncie? -. -¡No seas hipócrita Selena! – Exclamó Helen – ¡Queremos que acepte sus errores y renuncie por el bien de todos! -. -¿Y quién es usted para pedirme semejante acusación? ¿No están contentos por lo que hago? – consultó Selena. -¡Es una ciudadana, quien protesta de justificada manera y pide justicia por lo que has hecho! – gritó Lucy. -Por favor Lucy, no arremetes por favor – Jimmy trató de tranquilizar. -No me voy a calmar, hasta que esa bruja reconozca sus errores, desde los accidentes que causó aquella tarde en Smallville con aquel buldócer, luego, en querer destruir al Colegio Femenino, después, causaste alboroto en un hospital; pero si no fuera por alguien quien nos salvó hasta ahora de esos desastres, esto sería un caos mayor – argumentó Lucy, de manera airada. -Si no se dan cuenta, ni Superman ni su prima están acá, seguramente, ellos no vendrán en salvarlos porque ustedes están bajo mi yugo… - reaccionó Selena. -Además bruja, has desaparecido a varias personas inocentes como mi compañera Linda, a quien no la he visto en estos días cuando usted se apoderó de este mundo – siguió alegando Lucy, Selena volteó y miró a Bianca. -Es hora de darles una lección a estos manifestantes – paso siguiente, ordenó a los policías para que atraparan a todos los manifestantes y los metieran en los camiones para llevarlos directamente al castillo. En seguida, Selena habló al oído de un Ethan, cegado por la magia: - Aprendas esta lección, hay que ser mano dura frente a los demás, si ellos se oponen. De ahora en adelante serás el príncipe Ethan – y ordenó al chofer del auto para que los llevaran de vuelta al castillo. En la Zona Fantasma, Zaltar llevó en sus brazos a una Kara inconsciente hacia la cueva, allí la dejó en una piedra plana, en forma de cama. Cuando Zaltar preparaba algo, Kara levantó levemente sus ojos, vio que estaba adentro de una cueva, se paró, miró a su alrededor imágenes y figuras y se asustó; no sabía que pasó. Cuando caminó alrededor del lugar, trató de recordar lo último que pasó, pero, al hacerlo dolió su cabeza, lo que no sabía era que Zaltar se percataba, se acercó, extendiendo su mano detrás de ella, tocándola levemente su cabello arruinado y sucio, después tocó el hombro, Kara se volteó asustada y vio a alguien a quien no lo veía hace varios años. -¿Zaltar? – preguntó espantada Kara. -¿Quieres? – Zaltar le mostró un líquido en forma de atomizador. -Zaltar, ¡eres tú! – exclamó con alegría Kara. -Creo que no quieres, bueno… - Zaltar dejó el líquido, Kara lo pidió, le entregó el líquido y como sabía agrio, escupió. -Que amargo… - manifestó Kara, quien trató de recordar – Zaltar, pero si soy yo, Kara. -No te creo – contestó jocoso Zaltar – si fueras Kara, no estarías en esa débil condición, la Kara a quien conozco era hermosa, limpia en su aspecto exterior y limpia en su conciencia -. -Claro que soy yo, pero vestida con el traje similar al de mi primo Kal, eso sí totalmente sucia, pero créame Zaltar – insistió Kara. -Dime ¿encontró a tu primo? – preguntó Zaltar. -No… – respondió Kara con amargura. -¿Me imagino que no pudiste encontrar el Omegahedron? – siguió interrogando Zaltar. -No… - Kara resignó y se sentó en el suelo. -Lo lamento… - Zaltar se sentó al lado de la joven – mira, te muestro algo… – y enseño una figura hecha de barro – si quieres, es tuya, te lo regalo -. -¿Qué es? – curioseó Kara, tras recibir la figura. -Es un caballo, supongo. Los caballos son seres vivos que viven en La Tierra – explicó Zaltar. -Es muy bonito ¿lo creaste con la vara para realizar figuras? – siguió preguntando Kara. -No, es una figura que hice de tierra y barro de acá. Escucha, todos los seres vivos nacen de la tierra en forma viva, luego, cuando viven por buen tiempo mueren y sus cuerpos regresan a la tierra, sea en forma de polvo o comido por microorganismos – argumentó Zaltar. Mientras Zaltar y Kara conversaban en una cueva en la Zona Fantasma, en el castillo Selena persuadía a los gobernantes que estaban entre las rejas. -Señores, quiero dejar claro que mi intención es mejorar este mundo, si ustedes consideran, les podré dejar en libertad, con la condición de que trabajen para mí en la construcción de varios proyectos que todos tenemos pensado -. -Nos da pena con usted, pero de mi parte no quiero colaborar con una mujer loca, además, hemos tenido tantos problemas de enfrentar contra gobernantes desquiciados y con villanos que siempre quieren conquistar el mundo, ¿para que ahora trabajemos para usted y ensuciar nuestro desprestigio con nuestros pueblos?– cuestionó el presidente de los Estados Unidos -Señores, reflexionen – trató de convencer Selena – mi propuesta es para bien de ustedes, de sus familias y de sus naciones -. Los gobernantes hablaron en voz baja y llegaron a un acuerdo con el secretario de las Naciones Unidas, quien tomó la vocería. -Mire señora, preferimos mantener nuestro compromiso en gobernar bajo nuestras leyes, nuestros derechos y nuestro compromiso; en mantener nuestros mandatos al margen de propuestas de corrupción y destrucción como la suya – la respuesta del secretario causó el enojo de Selena. -Perfecto, si esa es su decisión, entonces haré justicia sobre todos los habitantes de este mundo, de hecho, les mostraré una prueba de mi propia justicia – al decir, Selena extendió su báculo oscuro e hizo aparecer varios personajes enjaulados en jaulas en forma esférica: Lucy, Jimmy, George, Helen y Nigel. Al contemplar esa escena, todos los presentes se sorprendieron y se asustaron, menos Nigel. -¡Uuuhhh!, qué espectáculo Selena, ahora nos enjaulas como pajarillos, fuiste muy bajo con tu magia, si que das pena – exclamó negativo Nigel. -¿Quién es ese señor? – preguntó Jimmy. -Es mi profesor de matemáticas y sistemas – respondió Lucy. -¿Nigel? – inquirió sorprendido el director Danvers. -Sí, soy el mismo – contestó. -Sabía que no eras de confianza, sospechaba que estabas detrás de toda esta situación, nunca me gustó su forma de ser – indicó Helen. -A ver, no entiendo – trató de entender el director Danvers. -Es una larga historia, que si contara, ya estaría despedido del colegio – habló arrepentido Nigel. Los gobernantes vieron con bastante preocupación sobre los cinco enjaulados. -Para que lo sepan, por rebelarse contra mí, ellos recibirán su castigo que será la muerte, eso les pasarán también a ustedes si no aceptan mis peticiones, por eso, los dejaré pensar para que cambien de opinión – advirtió Serena, quien salió. Los mandatarios se alegaron y se lamentaron, pensando en un milagro, en alguien quien los salve. En una de las cuevas de la Zona Fantasma, en medio de la conversación Kara preguntó a Zaltar. -¿Te acuerdas que tenías la vara para realizar figuras? -. -Claro que me acuerdo, además, aún la tengo – respondió Zaltar – pero no funciona acá en la Zona Fantasma -. -Cómo me encantaría que vivieras en La Tierra creando figuras hermosas y sorprendentes… - dijo Kara con cierta ilusión. -Me imagino que estuviste allá… - comentó Zaltar. -Es tal y como me dijiste, pero más sorprendente e impresionante de lo que me imaginaba, además, los habitantes de La Tierra en su mayoría son gente trabajadora, amable y pujante, ellos aprecian mucho a mi primo. Quería pasar de incógnito, pero algunos ya me reconocen por salvar vidas y solucionar problemas… - contó Kara, quien luego entristeció – sin embargo, mi misión de buscar el Omegahedron fue bastante difícil de lo que pensaba, ya que, una humana quien lo tiene está conquistando al planeta, me debilitó, no solo con la magia, manipulando el Omegahedron, sino también con la kriptonita, por ello, no pude hacer nada y ahora estoy acá… -. -Kara, a la edad que tú tienes, tu primo aún estudiaba en secundaria y no era el salvador de La Tierra, en ello lo superas, aunque, aún no sabes usar correctamente tus poderes; además, no todo está perdido mi niña… tengo una idea, pero no creo que seas capaz de afrontarla… - las palabras de Zaltar llamó la atención a Kara. -Dime Zaltar, ¿sabes cuál es la salida de esta zona? – preguntó ilusionada Kara. -Lo dudo, es imposible que puedas salir de acá, podrías exponerte ante un peligro inminente y seguramente podrías morir – negó Zaltar. -Por favor Zaltar, es mi única oportunidad para recuperar el Omegahedron, salvar La Tierra y salvar a Argos City – persuadió Kara. -No puedes – rehusó Zaltar – no podrás salir de la Zona Fantasma, eso lo saben todos los villanos y malvados en esta zona, hasta algunos perecieron en el intento -. -Es increíble que me decepcionas por completo Zaltar, pensaba que me ayudarías con esto y me sales con ese pesimismo, ahora todos están sufriendo por mi culpa: mis padres, los habitantes de Argos City, los habitantes de La Tierra, mis nuevos amigos y hasta alguien a quien amo; todos sufren, ¿y te parece mejor resignar? ¿Dejando que todos mueran? – alegó Kara con tono duro y enérgico, levantando de donde estaba sentada, Zaltar trató de tranquilizarla. -Sabía que me dirías eso y me merezco pagar por ese grave error ¿Por qué no tomamos este líquido refrescante? Estoy seguro que con esto te tranquilizas -. Kara tomó un respiro de desilusión, cogió la botella y antes de tomar hizo un improvisado brindis. -¿Sabes? Voy a brindar por el dolor, al final y a cuentas no me importa que todos sufran bajo el imperio de Selena; además, cuando mi primo venga sufrirá el mismo destino que yo sufrí, ¡Salud! – antes de tomar, Kara miró de reojo a Zaltar, quien pensaba de repente. -Sería buena idea realizar el intento – razonó Zaltar en voz alta. -Por supuesto, estoy segura que podemos salir hacia adelante. Vamos, no hay tiempo que perder – avisó sonriente Kara. Kara dejó el líquido, levantó a Zaltar quien cogió la vara y ambos salieron de la cueva directamente hacia un lugar en condiciones de vientos fríos y bruscos; ambos se cogieron de sus manos para no perder. Durante la larga travesía por la Zona Fantasma, Zaltar indicó a Kara un lugar extraño, referente a un vórtice que conducía hacia el exterior. En el vórtice estaba un alto desnivel rocoso empinado para escalar. Al ver la pendiente, Kara temió y cambió de decisión. -¡Tengo miedo, es peligroso! – gritó Kara. -¡Tienes que vencer el miedo! ¡Es la única forma de salir! – Insinuó Zaltar, quien recordó la vara y le dio a Kara como regalo - ¡De ahora esta vara es tuya, toma, te servirá! -. Ambos continuaron avanzando en el vórtice, cuando empezaron a subir, apareció un remolino en el centro del vórtice que no se movía por los lados. La presencia de Kara con Zaltar en el vórtice reaccionó al instante al Omegahedron en el castillo, cuando Selena trazó sus planes para extender su conquista a todos los países del mundo, Bianca vio preocupada la reacción de la fuerza energética. -Selena, el Omegahedron está reaccionando con bastante fuerza – avisó Bianca. Selena y Ethan se acercaron hacia una forma de piscina negra, donde vieron a dos personas en el vórtice, Selena se enojó. -No puedo creer, es esa chiquilla de nuevo, acompañada por una persona a quien no lo conozco – reaccionó Serena. -Seguramente es un amigo de Supergirl – aseguró Bianca, Ethan también los contempló detenidamente y recordó vagamente a Supergirl. -No permitiré que ellos lleguen hasta acá – Selena fue a donde estaban los libros de hechicería y buscó un conjuro de manera desesperada – lo encontré, enviaré bolas de fuego para bajarlos -. Kara y Zaltar avanzaron poco a poco hacia la mitad de la pendiente empinada, la joven estaba al frente de su tutor, quien la impulsaba hacia arriba, en igual sentido, Zaltar indicó con el dedo de su mano derecha una luz al final del vórtice. -¡Zaltar!, ¡No puedo más, estoy agotada! – increpó Kara. -¡De ninguna manera! ¡Si puedes! ¡Demuestre valor! – reiteró Zaltar. Ambos siguieron avanzando, pero observaron de repente que desde la salida expulsaban bolas de fuego y se protegieron; sin embargo, Zaltar era golpeado por una de ellas, en seguida Kara reaccionó, cogiendo con su mano izquierda para que su amigo no cayera. -¿Estás bien? – preguntó asustada Kara. -Sí, pero no te preocupes por mí, siga adelante que estaré contigo… - contestó Zaltar y ambos seguían subiendo. Tras ver su fallido conjuro, Selena buscaba con desespero otro conjuro más eficaz y poderoso para eliminar a ambas personas, en ese sentido, sonrió por lo que encontró. A pocos metros de llegar a la salida, Kara comenzó a percibir la energía del Omegahedron en su pulsera. -¡Zaltar! ¡Por fin siento la energía del Omegahedron! – gritó Kara. Lo que ambos no sabían, era que el remolino comenzó a mover por todos lados del vórtice con vientos bastantes bruscos, dejando en dificultades a ambos. -¡Avanza Kara! ¡No hay tiempo! – advirtió Zaltar, dando otro empujón hacia arriba. Cuando Kara llegó a la salida, miró hacia abajo y se aterró cuando Zaltar se quedaba resignado, viendo llegar al remolino. -Recuerde mi niña, yo siempre estaré contigo… - dicho eso, Zaltar fue llevado por el remolino, cayendo lentamente del vórtice. -¡Zaltar, NOOOO! – Kara lloró, perdió a su gran amigo y maestro, una persona quien la quería mucho y le enseñó sobre la vida. Supergirl no quería soportar, pero, tras recordar de la misión por cumplir, no lamentó más y se concentró en subir hacia la salida para que no fuera alcanzada por el remolino. Llegando hacia la luz, sintió que su fuerza y sus poderes regresaron de nuevo, alzó sus brazos y saltó fuerte para emprender su vuelo, decidida en vencer a Selena y recuperar el Omegahedron.

En ese momento, Supergirl salió del vórtice y en vuelo supersónico, pasó de la piscina negra y se volteó para ver a Selena. -¡Selena! Su momento y su juego terminó ¡Ríndase! – dijo seria Supergirl. -¡Jamás! – Negó Selena – Un paso más pajarito azul y sus amigos sufrirán -. Con su báculo de bambú africano, bajó las jaulas esféricas hacia unos grandes cristales puntiagudos que contenían altas temperaturas, en ese instante, algunos enjaulados comenzaron a temer. -Jimmy, tengo miedo, soy muy joven para morir – sobrecogió Lucy. -Tranquila Lucy, todo saldrá bien – envalentonó Jimmy. Supergirl no se sorprendió de esa maniobra y advirtió a Selena. -¡Déjalos en paz! ¿Acaso quieres hacer eso con todos los seres humanos? Si yo fuera usted, no lo haría -. De repente, Supergirl se volteó y dio un fuerte soplo de aire frío para romper los cristales, antes de que Selena con su magia soltara las jaulas. Los cristales fueron destrozados y los enjaulados cayeron ilesos, Supergirl fue hacia las jaulas y las rompió con la vara que le regaló Zaltar, todos salieron corriendo. -¡Salgan a un lugar seguro, rápido! – Instó Supergirl, al tiempo, todos fueron hacia una esquina, Supergirl avisó a Lucy – Lucy, toma esto – le dio su vara – presione la vara, con ello romperás las jaulas y podrás liberar a los demás prisioneros y sacarlos de aquí – Lucy lo cogió y se fue hacia los demás capturados, Jimmy la acompañaba. Enojada, Supergirl se acercó a Selena y la desafía. -Selena, devuélvame el Omegahedron, ¡Ahora! –. -Si quieres tener el Omegahedron, lo tendrás – respondió irónica Selena. Usando su báculo oscuro, Selena creó de nuevo el campo de energía con la kriptonita, causando de nuevo el malestar de Supergirl quien caía al suelo, a la vez, Selena abrió el piso en cuadros móviles por la lava incandescente. Supergirl no podía mover, se sentía débil por los efectos de la kriptonita. Ethan, al ver sufrir a Supergirl, encontró la kriptonita que estaba al lado del Omegahedron, al mismo tiempo que Selena se sorprendía ante la reacción del joven. -Ethan, ¿Qué haces? – cuestionó furibunda Selena. -Ahora recuerdo todo, no quiero ver sufrir a Supergirl por sus caprichos, Selena – dicho ello, Ethan fue hacia la ventana y lanzó lejos la kriptonita. Poco a poco Supergirl recuperaba sus poderes, en igual sentido, el campo de energía se desvaneció; sin embargo, Selena lanzó como un látigo un haz de energía a una de las estatuas, para que cayera directamente a Supergirl y mandarla a la lava incandescente, Cuando vio tal acción, Ethan gritó. -¡Supergirl, cuidado arriba! -. Selena escuchó el grito del joven y realizó un hechizo para tirarlo al piso y dejarlo inmóvil. Supergirl eludió la caída de la estatua, en seguida, vio lo que pasó con Ethan y lentamente se levantó, dejando iracunda a Selena. -Selena, reconsidere, ya no tienes amigos a quien apoyar, es mejor que se resigne – exhortó Supergirl cruzando sus brazos. -Puede ser que perezcan todos los que viven, incluida tú, por lo cual, serás la primera en sucumbir – alegó Selena. Bianca, al ver que todo salió de las manos a Selena, se retiró lentamente. -Es mejor que salgo de acá, si me permiten, porque la verdad no quiero saber nada de esta situación – Selena la escuchó y encolerizada envió un haz de energía para estrellar a Bianca contra la pared – Bueno, bueno, tú ganas Selena, no iré de acá. Por otro lado, Lucy corrió hacia las rejas, allá Jimmy encontró a Lois. -Señores, ¡Apártense! – gritó Lucy. Todos los prisioneros, incluyendo Lois se apartaron y Lucy presionó la vara para ablandar la cerradura y romperla, después todos salieron. -¡Todos salgan del castillo! – vociferó Lucy, pero Lois y Jimmy decidieron quedar. -Es mejor que nosotros nos quedamos, para ver si servimos de ayuda a Supergirl – expuso Louis a su hermana. -¿Están seguros? – inquirió Lucy. -Como no, recuerdas que somos periodistas, nunca abandonamos el lugar de la noticia – manifestó Jimmy. -¿Y qué esperamos? – avisó Lucy y los tres fueron al lugar donde estaba Supergirl. Selena recogió más energía del Omegahedron y preparó un poderoso hechizo, del cual, consistía en separar un ser similar a ella misma, pero de aspecto oscuro, dejando confundida a la chica de acero. -¡Selena, es mejor que no hagas más locuras! – Supergirl saltó a donde estaba Selena, pero aquel ser oscuro se abalanzó contra la kriptoniana, golpeándola con una fuerte patada del pie derecho, tirándola al piso. Supergirl estaba en problemas con aquel personaje, ya que, ese ser tenía una fuerza igual al de ella, con una agilidad y una rapidez de reacción. El ser oscuro se enfureció y partió hacia Supergirl para acabarla con sus letales golpes; al principio, Supergirl los eludía y los bloqueaba con sus brazos; a pesar de todo, la velocidad de los golpes del personaje la dejaba confundida, logrando el objetivo en arrojarla contra una de las paredes del castillo. Selena disfrutaba de la pelea, ordenando a su personaje en matar de una vez a Supergirl. El personaje acató la orden y comenzó en ahorcar con sus manos a Supergirl, quien no sentía su propia respiración; sin pensar dos veces, la hermosa joven trató de golpear fuertemente con su codo izquierdo varias veces al abdomen de la figura del personaje oscuro, causando bastante dolor. El personaje oscuro no podía estrangular más al cuello de Supergirl y cayó al suelo; haciendo irritar más a Selena, quien usando más energía, capturó a Supergirl con un fuerte haz en forma de una cuerda a todo el brazo, para halar con fuerza; en seguida, ordenó al personaje que se recuperara y cogiera el otro extremo del haz de energía en forma de cuerda y ambas comenzaron en halar desmesuradamente, causando más dolor a una débil Supergirl. -No puedo… - negaba en voz baja Supergirl – no puedo… -. A pesar de ello, una voz salió de su corazón: \"Claro que puedes, sea fuerte Kara, demuéstrales lo que eres…\", era la voz de Zaltar quien hizo fortalecer. La kriptoniana agarró con sus manos la cuerda, trató de reponer sus fuerzas, halando a Selena y al otro ser hacia de frente para golpearlas: -¡Si puedo! – Vociferó Supergirl, quien expulsó energía de sus manos al haz de energía, tumbando a ambos contra el suelo. El personaje oscuro recobró y fue por encima de la joven, no obstante, ella la golpeó con una fantástica patada voladora de su pie derecho al rostro, enviando directamente hacia la piscina negra. Selena se levantó y volvió a llamar al ser para que regresara, aunque, Ethan llegó arrastrando en el suelo hacia el cofre, al cual lo tumbó para que cayera al suelo, Selena vio lo que estaba haciendo y caminó hacia Ethan para matarlo. -¡Es el momento Supergirl, enfréntala de una vez! – gritó Nigel. Supergirl, viendo que Selena fue hacia Ethan, voló hacia ella y realizando círculos rápidos en forma de remolino, impidió la pretensión de Selena en matar a Ethan; además, el remolino absorbió a Bianca y a ambas mujeres las llevó hacia la piscina negra, en donde estaba la Zona Fantasma; luego, el remolino desvaneció, apareciendo la figura de Supergirl con los puños de sus manos en la cintura frente a la piscina. Todos los presentes, sorprendidos por la heroica hazaña de Supergirl, se alegraron y aplaudieron; menos Nigel, quien buscó por todos lados el cofre, sin saber que Ethan lo cogió para entregarlo a Supergirl. -¿Buscabas esto? – sonriente, Ethan enseñó el cofre, Supergirl lo abrió y cogió con toda delicadeza el Omegahedron. Cuando Supergirl quería agradecer a Ethan, la interrumpieron los mandatarios. -Supergirl, eres digna pariente de Superman, no sabemos en cómo agradecer – dijo con satisfacción el presidente de los Estados Unidos. -No me agradezcas señor presidente, pero tengo prisa, seguramente mi primo regresará y estará con ustedes, yo iré a devolver el Omegahedron a donde estaba – respondió sonriente Supergirl. -Antes de que vayas, quiero saber ¿qué pasó con Selena? – preguntó Lois. -Ambas fueron enviadas a la Zona Fantasma, donde estarán junto con los demás delincuentes, de allá no saldrán– contestó Supergirl. -¿Y qué pasará con este castillo? –siguió cuestionando Lois. -Creo que desaparecerá y todo volverá a la normalidad – argumentó Supergirl, requiriendo – quiero pedirles un favor a todos ustedes, que no digan en público lo que hice en este planeta, es importante que esto quede entre nosotros de manera confidencial, ya que, vine de paso cumpliendo solamente esta misión -. -No se preocupe Supergirl, de nuestra parte no diremos que estuviste por acá – prometió Jimmy. -Además, ni te hemos visto por estos lados – añadió Lucy, mostrando algo de su preocupación – solamente espero que Linda regrese –. Al escuchar, Supergirl abrazó a Lucy, quien se sorprendió. -Linda está bien, estoy segura que regresará, porque creo que ella fue a otra ciudad por temor, no te preocupes – mintió Supergirl. -¿Entonces tendré que eliminar el registro de la señorita Danvers de los registros de estudiantes del colegio? – consultó el director Danvers. -No, sugiero que guarde el cupo hasta que Linda regrese – tras responder, Supergirl se acordó de Ethan y habló – Ethan, quiero agradecerte que me hayas salvado en mi misión y compartir buenos momentos en esta aventura que tuve… -. -No me agradezcas Kara – desmintió Ethan, agregando algo en voz baja, con tono dulce – sin embargo, no me arrepiento en enamorarme de ti… Espero que llegues sana y salva por allá… Algún día esperaré tu regreso, para que podamos compartir juntos – en seguida, Ethan tocó suavemente el mentón y los labios de Supergirl con sus dedos – te quiero mucho, siempre te recordaré–. Supergirl sonrió tímidamente, tocando suavemente sus manos con las mejillas del joven. -Yo tampoco te olvidaré Ethan, estoy segura que regresaré pronto… -. Lucy recordó en devolver la vara a Supergirl, quien sonriente se despidió de todos emprendiendo el vuelo, llevando consigo el Omegahedron. Las puertas del castillo se abrieron, la chica de acero salió del castillo; minutos después, la montaña con el castillo desaparecieron, todos se alegraron en ver que estaban en el pueblo de Smallville, Lucy y Jimmy se besaron sin que Lois se percatara, los policías acompañaron a los mandatarios, custodiándolos en los camiones brindados para llevarlos de nuevo a Nueva York, en medio de un furor total de todos los habitantes de Smallville. Nigel, pensativo sobre lo sucedido, decidió olvidar, no obstante, encontró de sorpresa con una de sus estudiantes. -¡Nigel! – Gritó aquella joven – qué bueno que estés bien, ¿no le pasó nada malo? -. -Señorita Spencer… – respondió Nigel –estoy bien, si quieres hablemos en la cafetería y le explico lo que pasó, espero que cuando crezcas, seas buena estudiante y nunca caigas del error que cometió Selena – dicho ello, ambos caminaron hacia la cafetería. Lucy y Jimmy vieron a todo su alrededor, Lois los sorprendió cuando ambos se cogían de las manos. -Los pillé, par de tortolitos… - las palabras de Lois dejó muda a la pareja – espero que este suceso no sea un pretexto para que estén juntos -. -Lois por favor, si quieres iremos a Metrópolis, pero necesito hablar algo importante con Lucy, y es en serio – respondió tímido Jimmy. -Más les vale, por ahora nos veremos en la casa – cuando Lois se retiraba, Lucy charló con Jimmy. -Has mostrado que me quieres mucho, espero que lo nuestro perdure… - contó Lucy. -Si quieres nos tomamos unas fotos… - sugirió Jimmy, aunque, Lucy interrumpió. -Es mejor después, ¿te parece Jimmy? –. Cuando Lucy y Jimmy conversaron, Ethan se montó en su camión, en ese instante, divisó a la pareja, se despidió de ellos y todos cogieron rumbos diferentes. Por su parte, con bastante alegría Supergirl llevaba el Omegahedron resplandecido en sus manos, llegó hacia el río, sumergió en él y entrando en las profundas aguas, encontró la nave, del cual se abrió. La kriptoniana se acomodó y dirigió la nave hacia el espacio interior, rumbo a Argos City. Tras acercarse la nave a la ciudad, el Omegahedron dio su máximo resplandor y brillo, iluminando a toda la ciudad. Los habitantes de Argos City se mostraron complacidos y alegres con el regreso de Kara. Después de ingresar a Argos City, Kara pensó del amor de su vida, Ethan, a quien no lo abandonará: \"Algún día regresaré por ti Ethan, algún día…\". FIN Escrito el día jueves, 25 de febrero de 2010.

I am a big fan of the book, but it didn'tnreally instill the fanfiction vibe that the movie did. Max let out a deepnbreath, along with a puff of smoke, as he leaned against the wall ofnthe baseball dugout. The smoke from the cigarette in his hands mixednwith the steam from his breath as he closed his eyes. It was a cold,nNovember day, and he could feel that it was about to snow, no matternhow much he wished himself to be wrong. The sixteen year old tooknanother long draw from his cigarette, finishing it off. A sigh escaped thenteenager's lips as he dropped the cigarette to the ground, stampingnit out with the toe of his black converse shoe. Max pulled his blacknsweatshirt around him tightly as a cold wind blew over him. He hadnskipped Chemistry and now he had to wait until his class was overnbefore going back into the school so as not to draw attention tonhimself and the fact that he had been absent without leave. He reached into thenpocket of his baggy jeans, pulling out his phone to check the time.nFour more minutes. Not enough time for another cigarette, but toonlong to be comfortable standing in the cold. He pulled his lighternand cigarettes from his sweatshirt, deciding to smoke half of ancigarette, maybe more, and then stamp it out incomplete. Just as henwas lighting it, however, someone stopped him. \"Mr. Cordon.\" Mrs.nEllis, the gym teacher, rounded the corner, glaring at Max. \"Inthink you had best come with me.\" \"Shit.\" Maxnsighed, stamping the cigarette out. \"Shit is right, Mr.nCordon.\" Mrs. Ellis frowned, tapping her foot. \"Come along now –nthis century!\" The woman glared at Max and the teenager reluctantlynfollowed. He was moving slowly, having slept badly last night, thensame nightmares that had plagued him as a child having recentlynreturned, making his already ambiguous life more confusing. That morning, aroundnthree, Max had awoken from a dream in which Judith had come to hisnhigh school and kidnapped him, declaring that Carol would not calmndown until their 'king' returned. Of course, Max had come tonterms with the fact that the wild things, which he had believed to benso real when he was a child, were just part of a long, realisticnnightmare, but they still clouded over his dreams, sometimes asnfriends, others as foes. \"Mr. Cordon, what isnit this time?\" The principal's secretary rolled her eyes as shensaw Mrs. Ellis walk in, Max in tow. \"He was skippingnclass – smoking behind the dugout.\" Mrs. Ellis looked furious. \"Alright.\" Thensecretary sighed. \"Max, you know what to do.\" \"Sure.\" Maxnnodded, taking a seat, waiting while the secretary called his mother.nHe pushed his brown hair from his green eyes as he tapped his fingersnagainst the arm of the chair. Twenty minutes later,nhis mother walked through the door. \"Max, what was it this time?\"nShe approached her son. \"Nothing,\" Maxnmuttered. \"Skipping class,nsmoking, the usual.\" The secretary shrugged. \"He's suspended.\" \"How long?\" Max'snmother sighed, used to this sort of thing happening by now. \"Until Monday –nbut Ms. Cordon, the next time this happens, he's out. This is thenthird time this year, one more and he's out.\" \"Thank you.\" Max'snmother sighed as she grabbed Max's arm, pulling him out of thendoor. \"Max, what is your plan, exactly?\" She frowned at her sonnas they reached the car. \"This is the only high school in thisntown, public, at least, and none of the private schools are going tontake you if you get expelled. If you get kicked out, Max, you'llnhave to go to the military academy.\" \"I know,\" Maxnmuttered, getting into the passenger's seat. \"Max, this isn'tnsomething that we can just tiptoe around! With Claire away atncollege, I had hoped that you would see things a little more clearly,nbut you're just as bad as you were – worse, even. I just don'tnunderstand what's wrong with you, Max.\" She sighed. \"You usednto be such a good kid – at least most of the time, now I'm luckynif I can get a full sentence out of you! Hell, I spend more timentalking to your principal than I do talking to you.\" Max didn't respond.nHe simply slumped against the chair as his mother rambled on and onnabout what a disaster he was. He hated the way that she talked aboutnhim, but he couldn't argue it, because he knew that she was right.nHe was a difficult teen, he knew that he caused more trouble than henwas worth sometimes, but he didn't care, and that almost made himnfeel guilty. Almost. \"Max, hand it over.\"nMax's mother sighed as they both got out of the car upon reachingnthe house. \"What?\" Max lookednover at his mother, raising an eyebrow as he slung one strap of hisnbackpack over his shoulder. \"Lighter,ncigarettes, hand them over.\" She held her hand out, palm up. \"Fine.\" Max rollednhis eyes, handing her the lighter and the nearly finished pack ofncigarettes. \"All of them.\" Hisnmother narrowed her eyes. \"FINE!\" Max pulledna second back of cigarettes from his pocket and threw them at her. \"You know, I don'tneven know when you got like this.\" She sighed, unlocking the doornto the house. \"We used to be so close.\" \"Yeah, and it'snall my fault that we're not anymore.\" Max's voice dripped withnsarcasm as he entered the house, dropping his pack on the hallwaynfloor. \"What's thatnsupposed to mean?\" \"It means that maybenif you spent just a little less time with Mr. Right and a little morenpaying attention to what actually happens in this house, you mightnhave noticed that I started smoking in the seventh grade – but no,nit took you until two months ago to realize that I was going throughnmore than pack a day!\" Max turned, stomping towards his room. \"What?\" Her jawndropped as her son headed up the stairs, an angry blur ofnangst-ridden teen. \"Max, come back here!\" \"NO!\" Max slammednthe door to his bedroom, flopping down on the bed. He grabbed hisnheadphones, jamming them over his ears and turning on his iPod,nclosing his eyes as the loud, steady beat of the trumpet mixed withndrums, trombone, guitar, bass and whatever else composed ska musicnfilled his ears. At this point, music was the only thing in his lifenthat was easy and he was desperate to keep one thing in his life fromngetting out of hand.[Chapter 2] \"I just don't know what to do about him – recently he's just been more to handle than I could ever imagine him being. I knew that things would be rough when his father died, but I never imagined that he would be this out of control!\" Max frowned as he leaned up against the wall in the hallway outside of his mother's bedroom. He hated it when his mother talked to her 'new' husband about him – he hated that she spoke to him as though Max was his son, as though he actually had a clue when it came to Max. \"Diane, you're doing everything right.\" The man put his arm around Max's mother. \"He's a difficult child – perhaps you should send him to the Military Academy no matter what – I hate to say this, but I don't like watching you bend over backwards in support of a lost cause. Max clearly needs discipline that we can't give him.\" That was about all that Max could take. His stepfather's words made his stomach turn – he was NOT a child, nor was he a lost cause. This man had no right to come into his family and say those things. Max knew that he was grounded until Monday, but he needed a cigarette badly and there was no way that he was going to get his back from his mother. He went into his room, locked the door, and hoisted himself out of the window. Over the years, Max had become an artist of sneaking out. He hated being stuck in the house at night – listening to his mother and stepfather and until last year, Claire and her friends, her boyfriend, so he had learned to lock his door from the inside, climb out the window, down the drainpipe and to the sidewalk, where he could wander around the neighborhood until he was ready to go home. The second that Max's feet hit the pavement, he felt a little bit better. IF he wanted to, he could take off, just run away from a family that, once again, held no place for him. Max shoved his hands into his pockets as he began to walk, ignoring the cold air, pretending that he didn't care about the knit cap lying left behind on his dresser. He had, however, brought fingerless gloves with him, though that was because he had forgotten to remove them from his pockets earlier and not that he had remembered to bring them along. Max slipped the gloves over his hands, pulling his fingers through the tops of the black gloves, which he had cut away himself. The second that his gloves were on, he covered his ears with his headphones, allowing the carefree sounds of Reel Big Fish to take over his world. The convenience store nearest his house had to be passed up, as they checked the ID of any young person attempting to purchase cigarettes. Normally, this annoyed Max, but that night, he was glad for the extended walk – it gave him more time to just breathe, to drive his stepfather's words from his brain with the pointless words and upbeat sounds of the personal soundtrack that he had spent more time than necessary creating. \"Hey.\" Max walked up to the counter. He grabbed a cheap, plastic lighter, and tossed it onto the counter before speaking to the bored looking clerk. \"I need a pack of cigarettes.\" \"What kind?\" the man asked, standing to get what Max had asked for. \"Just whatever's cheapest.\" He shrugged. Brand didn't matter to him – just as long as he got what he needed from the item – warmth, nicotine and relaxation, the design on the box couldn't have mattered less. \"Ok then.\" The clerk threw a pack next to the lighter, ringing up Max's total. The teenager paid and took his purchases, leaving the store immediately, desperate to satiate his needs. As Max took the first drag on the cigarette, he felt a wave of relief wash over him. He leaned up against the side of the building, his eyes closing as he let the nicotine mix with the ska music still pounding through his headphones – the ultimate cocktail for relaxation. When he was finished, Max stamped the butt of the cigarette out against the side of the building, beginning to walk back towards home as he lit a second. However, Max dropped both cigarette and lighter no more than a block from the store as a stabbing pain shot through his head. Max let out an anguished cry, stepping on and crushing the cheap lighter as stumbled forwards. He tore off his headphones, gripping his forehead in an attempt to soothe the sharp, sudden ache. The pain refused to subside, and Max found himself falling to his knees, meeting the sidewalk with a hit that seemed mild in pain compared to that which was shooting through his forehead. Seconds later, Max was on the ground entirely, writhing in the pain of the splitting headache. \"Max…\" As he squeezed his eyes shut, a voice filled his head. \"Max, come back to us! We need you Max!\" No sooner than the voice had spoken, images filled his head. Carol was standing on the beach, calling to him. \"Max, we need you to come back to us, please!\" \"Max!\" K.W. joined in. \"Max, please! Help us! We need you!\" Max let out a strangled cry as his head continued to feel as though it were about to split in two. Tears that he was unaware of streamed down his cheeks and he pulled his legs tightly to his chest, curling up into a tight ball. He didn't understand what was happening to him. \"Max!\" Carol looked outwards with pleading eyes. \"We need you! Come back to us, please, Max, we need your help!\" \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" Max managed to shout, the images taking over his mind. \"You're not real! YOU'RE NOT FUCKING REAL!\" \"Max, how could you say that?\" K.W. frowned at him. \"Max, we need you! How can you deny us? Please, Max! We can't make it without your assistance!\" Carol and K.W. continued to plead with him as pain continued to sear through his head. Carol was walking further out into the water, Max felt as though the beast were getting closer and closer to him, and then all of a sudden, the images were gone, the voices were gone and the pain was gone – in fact, everything around him disappeared as Max fell from consciousness.[Chapter 3] A/N Hey, I'm sorry that this update took me so long to get to you! I was really busy this past week and I am afraid that updates will continue to be slow, as NaNoWriMo starts tomorrow and I will still be juggling at least three fanfics while working on my NaNo. Thank you for your impending patience, and thank you for reading! I love you all! When Max opened his eyes, his vision was blurry and his ears were filled with the cliché beeping of the hospital room. He struggled to remember what had happened that would have landed him in the hospital, but all that he could recall was a headache and traces of an nightmare. He looked around, frowning as he took in the bleak room. \"Max, my god!\" Max jumped slightly as his mother swooped down on him. \"What happened to you?\" She put her hand on Max's forehead. \"How do you feel?\" \"I feel fine.\" Max shrugged. \"And I don't know what happened – just had a headache, then I woke up here.\" Max pulled away from his mother's hand. \"The doctor said that you passed out on the sidewalk.\" She sighed as she pulled up a chair next to Max's bed. \"When the hospital called, we didn't even know you were out – we thought you were in your room.\" \"Shocking,\" Max muttered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Max, something could have happened to you! I mean something did happen to you, but it could have been a lot worse, you can't just sneak out like that!\" \"Mom, I'm fine.\" Max rolled his eyes. \"Leave me alone.\" \"I'll just…I'll just get the doctor then?\" She stood up, leaving the room, returning a couple of minutes later, doctor in tow. \"Hello, Max, I'm Dr. Schwartz. I'd like you ask you a few questions.\" Max just shrugged, so the doctor continued. \"Can you tell me what you know about how you got here?\" The doctor sat down and Max barely even looked up as his mother back out of the room, leaving the two alone. \"I had a headache, then I was here, now I'm fine.\" Max shrugged again. \"That's it.\" \"So just a headache?\" The doctor asked. \"No seizing?\" \"Not that I know of…\" Max shook his head. \"Alright then, just a headache?\" \"Just a headache.\" Max nodded. \"So can I go?\" \"Well actually, Max, I'd like to run a test or two. I don't mean to scare you, but headaches that lead to unconsciousness aren't normal and they can occur as symptoms for some pretty serious things.\" \"Whatever.\" Max shrugged yet again. He didn't want any sort of tests run on him, but he knew that his mother would force it upon him anyways. \"Good.\" Dr. Schwartz smiled. \"We'll just do a routine CAT scan, make sure that everything's how it should be, and if that comes up normal, we shouldn't need to do anything else.\" \"Ok.\" Max nodded. \"Fine.\" CAT scan. He'd heard of that. CAT scans found brain tumors, serious head injuries, things that could be fatally serious or absolutely nothing at all. Thoughts of what could be wrong with him filled his mind, though he chose to mask his fear, hiding behind his monotonous 'whatever' attitude. *** \"Well, Max.\" Dr. Schwartz smiled at the boy as he entered the room, carrying with him the results of the CAT scan. \"It looks like you really are perfectly healthy.\" \"Ok.\" Max kept his relief shrouded in nonchalance, shrugging to emphasize how little he cared – or how little he pretended to care. \"So, I can go?\" \"I don't see why not.\" The doctor nodded. \"Your clothes are on the chair behind me, you can dress while your mother checks out.\" \"Ok.\" Max pulled himself into a sitting position. \"Goodbye, Max, I hope never to see you again.\" Dr. Schwartz joked, laughing at his own cleverness as he vacated the room. Max got to his feet slowly, taking time putting on his plain white shirt, loose jeans, socks and sneakers. By the time he had pulled his sweatshirt on, he had realized that, while he had his wallet and phone, his iPod was gone. He assumed that the device had fallen onto the sidewalk when he had passed out, and who wouldn't have picked up a stray music playing device? Max let out a deep sigh, knowing that he would have to revert to the use of burnt CDs and his old disc man until he received Christmas money from his grandparents in the mail. When Max got home, his mother ordered him to bed, and the boy was too overwhelmed by a mixture of confusion and fatigue left over from his 'accident' that he did not have the strength to argue. He went to his room, flopped down on the mattress and crawled beneath the blankets. Max lay on his bed for hours, afraid to try to sleep, afraid to close his eyes, even, though he was not sure why. The next several days were spent in his room, in bed, sleeping little, despite his knowledge that lack of rest would hinder his healing process. He would stay awake for as long as he could, entirely unsure of what he was dreading should he drift off. During the time he was asleep, he found himself captured in a nearly comatose, dreamless, motionless state, which, aside from its physical aid, soothed the teen little. He knew that there had been something that had caused him to pass out that night, something strange about the incident that he couldn't quite remember, something important. He knew that there was a large piece to this puzzle that he was missing, and if he could only recall it, he would be able to understand what happened to him, perhaps. Max spent hours of his time in bed pulling at his brain, begging himself to remember any small detail that might bear any impact on what had happened, yet he found that, as he so often was in his life, he grasping at the empty straws of a memory repressed for his own protection. What Max did not know was that when that memory broke free of its confines, it would reign over him once again.[Chapter 4] \"You've got good taste.\" Max closed his locker on Monday morning to see a boy leaning up against the locker next to his. The boy had shaggy brown hair and brown eyes. He wore baggy jeans and a short sleeved plain white shirt, but the casual look was upgraded by the black vest left unbuttoned over his white shirt and the black fedora with the checkered band perched on his head. The boy also had a checkered sweatband around his left wrist and most noticeably of all, a British accent. \"What?\" Max frowned as he looked at the boy. He had never seen him before in his life and it was odd that anyone would be talking to him, as he didn't have many friends. \"You've got good taste,\" the boy repeated, reaching into the pocket of his loose jeans. He pulled out an iPod, holding it out to Max. \"You're missing the Mighty Mighty BossTones, though, thought you might want to know that.\" \"What?\" Max grabbed his iPod. \"How did you get this?\" \"The EMTs left it behind when they took you to the hospital.\" The boy shrugged. \"Wait…\" Max frowned, shoving the music player into his own pocket. \"You were there?\" \"Fucking yeah I was.\" The boy nodded. \"I mean how did you think called the paramedics? Did you not remember?\" \"Remember?\" \"You spoke to me! You were writhing around, screaming on the sidewalk, yeah? Then you passed out and I checked you for signs of life, called for an ambulance and you woke up for a couple of minutes, said you had to help Carol, said that 'they' were in trouble…whoever 'they' are.\" The boy shrugged again, and confusion soared through Max. \"I've never seen you before in my life…\" Max gulped. \"I wondered if you'd recall, suppose you didn't, but it's no matter, really.\" The boy held his hand out to Max. \"I'm Liam, just moved here from Liverpool.\" \"Um…Max.\" Max hesitantly took the other boy's hand, shaking it loosely. \"Good to meet you, Max.\" Liam smiled, reaching into his backpack, pulling out a blank CD in a clear plastic holder. \"Here you are.\" \"What's this?\" Max looked even more confused as he accepted the CD. \"I told you,\" Liam stated. \"You're missing the Mighty Mighty BossTones.\" \"Oh.\" Max transferred the CD to his own backpack. \"Um, thank you?\" \"You're welcome – I mean, not that it takes long to burn a CD, that's just one. If you like it, though, I've got all of their other ones, I'd be happy to make you copies.\" \"I meant thanks for, you know, calling the ambulance and returning my iPod, but yeah, the CD's cool too.\" \"You don't need to thank me for the other two.\" Liam shook his head. \"Just did what anyone should've. I mean I probably shouldn't have gone through the iPod, but it wasn't like it could hurt to see what you listened to.\" \"Don't worry about it.\" Max pulled his backpack onto his back. \"Well…see ya.\" He walked off, leaving the boy behind. Max knew that he was being rude, but he didn't care – what else was he supposed to do? A lot of things were still confusing to him and now this Liam guy was saying that he had been talking about Carol. That part of Max's life was over…or at least it was supposed to be. In class, Max sat in the back as he always did, but instead of doing nothing and staring at the wall, he pulled his pencil out and began to scribble in the margins of his notebook. At first, it was just a tiny doodle, one tree and some earthy ground, but it soon grew into a forest, trees dancing all of the way across the page. Before he knew it, a figure joined the trees, then another and yet another and Max became completely lost in the drawing. \"Oi, chill out there!\" As the bell rang, Max jumped as he was jarred from his artwork, and a newly familiar voice filled his ears. \"It's just the bell.\" \"I know that,\" Max snapped, getting to his feet. He moved to close his notebook, but Liam was faster, snatching it away, eyes scanning the drawing. \"Whoa…\" Liam let out a deep breath as he looked at the sketch. \"This is really, really good, mate! These monster things, they're well brilliant!\" \"Give me that.\" Max grabbed the notebook, shoving it back into his pack. \"Whoa, no need to get your knickers in a twist!\" Liam looked hurt as he backed away from Max a few inches. \"I was just admiring your artwork.\" \"It's not artwork.\" Max shook his head. \"Then what would you call it? Because to me, that was a fucking amazing drawing. I mean I've just begun to try my hand at drawing, but I'm no good, maybe…maybe you could help me out?\" \"If I do, will you stop grabbing at my things?\" Max asked. For some reason, this boy was persistent to speak with him, refusing to let it go, and while Max normally would have brushed him off, ignored his presence entirely, he did feel as though he owed Liam something. After all, had Liam not been around, Max would have been laying on the sidewalk unconscious for a lot longer and far worse things could have happened to him. \"Fair deal.\" Liam nodded. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a folded up piece of paper. \"Take a look at this for me, yeah? I mean I don't know what it is, it just sort of came to me in the middle of class, it's just a doodle, really, but I like the image, I'd like to maybe try and draw it for real, but I'd like some help.\" \"Alright.\" Max took the paper and unfolded it. A sharp gasp escaped Max as his eyes fell upon the drawing of a boy in a white wolf's suit, a crown on his head. He dropped the paper to the floor, his hands beginning to shake, followed by the rest of him. Liam looked around the classroom, which had emptied around them, then back at Max. \"You alright?\" Liam frowned as Max began to shake more violently. Seconds later, Max emitted a cry of pain and his hands flew to his forehead as he fell to his knees. \"Max?\" Liam's eyes widened as Max began to scream, pain taking over his body. \"Somebody help!\" Liam got to his knees, putting his arms around Max as he continued to shout for assistance, trying to steady the seizing boy. Someone called 9-1-1 as Liam attempted to move Max, who was flailing about like Liam had only ever seen in the movies. It was blatantly clear now that Max was having a seizure and from classes Liam had taken, he knew this wasn't a good thing. He put his hands on Max's head, knowing that this was the most important thing. Once he had the boy semi steady, he rested the boy's head in his own lap, pulling his soft, leather wallet from his pocket. He slid the wallet into Max's mouth, trying to keep him from swallowing his own tongue. \"I've got you, you're going to be ok,\" he whispered, holding Max as steady as he could, waiting for the paramedics to arrive. After almost a minute, Max stopped shaking, falling unconscious in Liam's arms.[Chapter 5] \"Back so soon?\" Max woke up to Dr. Schwartz standing over him, clucking his tongue. \"Where is he?\" Max asked, sitting up instantly. \"Where is who?\" Dr. Schwartz asked. \"Liam,\" he stated. \"British kid with a fedora.\" \"Oh, the boy who rode in the ambulance with you?\" Dr. Schwartz asked. \"He's not family, we sent him home.\" \"Good.\" Max fell back, relaxing slightly. \"Why?\" Dr. Schwartz asked. \"He said you just started seizing in class…did he do something to you?\" \"Yes, I mean no, I mean…I don't know.\" Max shrugged. \"Can I just go home?\" \"No.\" Dr. Schwartz shook his head. \"Max, something is going on with you, and I've run every test that I can think of and nothing's coming up.\" He bit his lip. \"At least nothing physical.\"' \"What do you mean?\" Max asked, frowning at the doctor. \"I mean that sometimes when teenagers start to experience things like this, intense headaches, passing out, it's because they're under a lot of psychological stress, lack of sleep, social anxiety, things like that.\" \"I'm fine,\" Max argued. \"You're clearly not,\" Dr. Schwartz stated. \"And before you leave, I'd like you to talk to one of our psychiatrists. You don't have to leave this room, she'll come here to speak with you, if you like, or you can go to her office.\" \"I don't to talk to anyone,\" he stated. \"Max, you're 16 years old,\" the doctor stated. \"Your mother agrees with me, she thinks you need help, and since you're still under her control legally, she has asked me to keep you here until you talk to someone.\" \"That's kidnapping!\" Max stated, feeling instantly outraged. \"No, it's not.\" The doctor shook his head. \"If she thinks you're in danger physically or mentally, she has every right to want you to stay here. We'd have to move you to a different wing, of course, but you need to talk to someone or stay here where we can keep an eye on you.\" \"That's blackmail,\" Max hissed. \"Maybe so, but it's necessary.\" The doctor sighed. \"It's for your own good, Max.\" \"Fuck you,\" Max spat. Dr. Schwartz just looked at Max, one eyebrow raised. \"Fine,\" Max stated, glaring at the doctor. \"I'll go see your stupid fucking shrink if it gets me out of this room.\" \"Good.\" The doctor smiled at Max. \"I'll have a nurse take you down there.\" \"I can find it by myself,\" Max snarled. \"I'm afraid that's against hospital policy.\" He shook his head and disappeared. A nurse came in with a wheel chair a few minutes later, and begrudgingly, Max got in, allowing himself to be taken across the hospital to a small but cozy office. \"Hello.\" A woman rose, walking over to them. \"I'm Dr. Danielle Sparks, you must be Max Cordon.\" \"Yeah,\" Max grumbled, getting out of the wheel chair and flopping onto the couch. \"That's what they tell me.\" \"What they tell you?\" Danielle asked, sitting in the chair across from him. \"Dude, are you seriously going to analyze everything that I say?\" Max asked, folding his arms across his chest. \"That is my job, yes.\" Danielle nodded. \"Perhaps it would be useful for you if I explained what I do?\" \"No.\" Max shook his head. \"I don't want to be here, I don't need to be here, my mom's forcing me to do this, and since I know you can't talk to her about these sessions, I'm not gonna say anything.\" \"You're right, I can't tell her anything you tell me,\" Danielle said softly. \"But that should give you all the more reason to trust me. I hear you've been in the hospital twice for falling unconscious, both accompanied by dreadful headaches and once by a seizure?\" she asked. Max just shrugged. \"Yet your records show that you are perfectly healthy, so there has to be something going on in your mind that's impacting the way your body is functioning.\" \"There's nothing wrong with my mind,\" Max snapped. \"I didn't say there was anything wrong with it,\" Danielle shook her head. \"I merely said that there is something going on, something out of the ordinary.\" \"Yeah, well your guess is as good as mine.\" Max shrugged. \"So there's nothing that you see as a reason for any of this?\" Danielle asked. \"Nothing that's changed in your life recently?\" \"Nope. I'm fine.\" Max shrugged. \"But you've been to therapy before,\" she stated. \"I was like, a kid then.\" Max rolled his eyes. His mother had taken him and his sister to grief counseling when his father had died, and again to family counseling after she got remarried. \"It was nothing, just family bullshit.\" \"Your father dying and your mother remarrying is never bullshit.\" Danielle shook her head. \"I know that you don't believe that.\" \"You don't know anything about me,\" Max stated. \"The things that you have written down in your file, that's not who I am, that's who they say I am.\" \"When you say they, who are you talking about?\" Danielle asked. \"My mother, my stepfather, Dr. Schwartz, the other shrinks, who the fuck did you think I was talking about?\" he asked. \"Sometimes people think that there are people out to get them, sometimes people say \"they\" as a way of referring to someone they don't know but feel is watching them or trying to hurt them.\" \"I'm not a fucking head case,\" Max declared. \"I'm not crazy and I'm not paranoid, no one's following me, no one's out to get me, my mom just wants me to be someone I'm not, and until I turn into that person, she's gonna send me to you.\" \"So you feel anger and resentment towards your mother?\" Danielle asked. \"Fuck you,\" Max stated, standing up. \"I don't need this bullshit.\" \"Max, I'm just trying to help you,\" Danielle stated, getting to her feet as well. \"Please, you have a full hour, I'd like for you to stay for that entire time, if you don't, I'm afraid your agreement with your mother will not be honored.\" \"So you're in on the blackmail too?\" Max asked, turning around and slumping back down on the couch. \"Fine, I'll sit here and wait.\" He looked at the clock. \"While you wait, will you tell me how you felt right before you passed out both today and last week?\" \"No,\" Max stated. \"Will you tell me about this Liam boy? Dr. Schwartz wrote that you said you didn't know if he had done something to you, can you explain that for me?\" \"No,\" Max said again. \"Are you going to talk to me at all?\" Danielle asked. \"No.\" Max shook his head. \"Fine.\" Danielle nodded, setting her notepad aside. \"Then we can just sit here for the next 37 minutes.\" \"Fine by me,\" Max snapped. He would rather sit and wait this out than talk about anything with this person. She wouldn't understand him, hell, if he told her what had really been happening with him, she'd probably have him locked up in some asylum faster than you could bat an eyelash. If this shrink thought that he was going to cave in and speak, she was sadly mistaken. The hour passed and Max said nothing else. \"Alright, that's the hour,\" Danielle stated finally, getting to her feet and opening the door for Max, who stood, heading for it swiftly. \"I'll see you next week?\" she asked. \"What?\" Max shook his head. \"Hell no.\" \"I'm afraid that's part of the deal, Max.\" Max looked up to see his mother. \"What?\" Max frowned. \"No, mom!\" \"Something's going on with you, Max,\" she whispered. \"And if you won't go see someone about it, I'm going to have to insist you go to a treatment center.\" \"What the fuck?\" Max frowned. \"What are you saying.\" \"I'm saying you need help.\" \"No.\" He shook his head. \"You're saying it's Dr. Interrogation or it's an insane asylum.\" He frowned as he stared at his mother. \"You think I'm crazy, don't you.\" \"Max…\" \"Don't you?\" Max shouted. \"Max, I don't know what to think anymore,\" she said with a sigh. \"You don't talk to me, you don't have any friends to talk to, and you need to talk to someone, so what's it going to be?\" she asked. \"Dr. Sparks or a treatment center?\" \"Dr. Sparks,\" Max hissed, knowing that he'd rather spend an hour in silence every week than time in a treatment center being watched nonstop. \"Good.\" His mother nodded. \"Come on, let's get you home.\" Max didn't say anything, he just followed his mother to the car, sitting in the front seat, his head resting against the window. When they got back home, his mother parked the car, but didn't get out. \"Look, Max, I know that you're mad at me, but I just want what's best for you…\" \"Yeah, right.\" Max scoffed, stepping out of the car and grabbing his backpack. \"Max, I'm serious,\" his mother said softly. \"I love you.\" \"Yeah?\" Max shrugged. \"Well that's too bad, because I hate you.\" He entered the house and ran up to his room, slamming the door shut and locking it. He lay down on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. What the hell was happening to him? Why did he keep passing out? More importantly, who the hell was this Liam guy and why had he drawn a picture of Max in his wolf suit? A/N Okay, so I have no idea if anyone is still reading this, but I had an urge to work on it again after like, about a year, so here goes...hopefully I'll finish it this time around. Let me know what you think - sorry if this isn't the way you saw things going with Max, he's kind of a wildcard.[Chapter 6] Max's mother kept him home from school for the next few days, deciding that he wasn't strong enough physically or mentally to be in a crowded place right now. He didn't really like being at home, but it beat being at school, and he just stayed in his room the whole time listening to music and reading. It had been three days since he had left the hospital, and he had been having nightmares and headaches every day and night since. He didn't tell his mother, though, because he knew that if he did, she would just take him in for more testing, and that was the last thing that he needed right now. \"Max?\" his mother knocked on the door, and he instantly shoved the lighter that he had been playing with under his pillow. \"Max, honey, there's someone here to see you, says he's a friend of yours from school.\" \"I don't have any friends,\" Max stated, but it was too late, his mother had already opened the door, showing Liam inside. Max's eyes widened as the boy entered his room, and he was going to ask his mom to show Liam out, but she left before he got the chance. \"Hey.\" Liam leaned against the wall, giving Max his space. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" Max spat. \"I came to see if you were alright…\" Liam frowned. \"You had a seizure in class, they wouldn't tell me anything at the hospital, so I thought I'd come by and see for myself if everything was alright.\" \"Is this some sick game to you?\" Max hissed, standing up and walking over to Liam. \"Max, what are you talking about?\" Liam backed away slightly, looking confused. \"Coming here? Why would you think that was alright with me? Why would you tell my mother that we were friends? We're not friends.\" Max shook his head, glaring at Liam. \"Look, I just thought…\" he bit his lip. \"Just thought what?\" Max asked. \"That it'd be fun to fuck with me? I know you're hiding something from me, Liam, I just don't know what it is.\" \"Max, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about!\" Liam's eyes widened with fear, and he backed up even more. \"Oh don't play naïve with me,\" Max snarled. \"You've been around me both times I've passed out – are you trying to tell me that was a coincidence? That you just happened to be there both times I've had these weird attacks or episodes or whatever the hell they are?\" Max shook his head, frowning at the boy. \"Not a chance in hell.\" \"Max, I don't know what you're on about, I wasn't there when you passed out the first time, I came across you after the fact!\" Liam was backed up against the far wall, but Max was still moving forwards. \"Max, you look crazy right now!\" \"Is that what you want people to think?\" Max asked. \"That I'm crazy? Did he put you up to this?\" \"He who, Max?\" Liam asked. \"I have NO idea what you're going on about! Really, I don't!\" \"Jacob,\" Max stated. \"My stepfather, did he put you up to this? I know he'd love to see me end up in an institution, then he wouldn't have to fucking deal with me.\" \"I've never met your stepfather, Max,\" Liam stated. \"I'm not trying to hurt you, what the hell is wrong with you?\" \"The picture,\" Max hissed. \"The picture you drew in art class today, what the hell, man?\" \"What do you mean?\" Liam asked. \"Why did you draw that?\" \"I don't know, I told you! The idea just came to me, I thought it was kind of cute, you know, a little kid in a wolf suit with a crown?\" \"I don't think it's cute at all,\" Max hissed. \"I think it makes you a fucking stalker.\" \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Liam asked, his eyes growing even wider. \"You've been stalking me, haven't you?\" Max accused, jabbing a finger into Liam's chest. \"Why? I want to know why.\" \"Max, I have NO idea what you're talking about, how many times do I have to say it?\" Liam asked, his voice shaking with fear. Max looked insane to him and, in this moment, a little on the dangerous side. \"Max, I'm not stalking you, why would you say that?\" he frowned. \"Like you don't know,\" Max scoffed, rolling his eyes. \"I honestly don't!\" Liam stated, a lump rising in his throat. \"Oh yeah?\" Max turned away from Liam and went through his closet, digging through it for several minutes before he produced the wolf suit. It was ratty and dirty, but it was very clear that it was the one from the picture. \"Oh.\" Liam frowned. \"Well I must have seen it on some kid somewhere or something.\" Liam shrugged. \"You don't need to freak out, I'm sure a lot of kids have the same suit hell, maybe I had one when I was younger and I don't remember it.\" \"No.\" Max shook his head, tossing the suit aside. \"No, you didn't, and you didn't see it on anyone else because my mom made that for me. We didn't buy it some store where there were a hundred other costumes just like it, she made it for me, it's one of a kind. The kid you drew in class, that kid was me, now I'm just really, really curious as to how you knew about that if you've just moved here from Liverpool.\" \"Max, I swear to god I don't know,\" Liam stated, his eyes widening as Max spoke. \"Do you believe in god?\" \"Well, no…\" Liam bit his lip. \"Then what weight does swearing to him have?\" \"Max, I promise you, I have no idea how I got that image, I just moved here, I had no idea that was you in the suit, that you even had that suit. I told you it just came to me and it did.\" \"How can I believe that?\" Max asked. \"It's too much of a fucking coincidence to be true. \"Max, trust me.\" \"Why should I? I don't know you!\" \"You know what? Fine.\" Liam shook his head, heading for the door. \"I just came by to see if you were okay, to see if you liked the Bosstones CD, but clearly, you're a head case just like everyone's saying. I won't be back.\" Liam opened the door and walked out, slamming it behind him. Max fell back onto his bed, breathing heavily. What the hell was happening? What the hell was going on? Did Liam really not know where that image came from? And even if he had stalked him, how would he have known about the crown. \"Maxwell Cordon, what the HELL just happened?\" his mother stormed into the room. \"That boy, your friend just left the house in tears!\" \"I told you, mom,\" Max stated, lying down on the bed. \"I don't have any friends.\" A/N So yeah, felt like working on this some more - I'm sick, so it's probably not very high quality, not that it ever is. :P Just curious to see if anyone's reading, what do you guys think of Max? Of Liam? Do you like them? I know Max is a bit of a basket case right now, but I dunno...I kind of like it, I want to know what you all think![Chapter 7] \"So.\" Danielle sat in the chair across from Max. \"Your mother told me that a friend came to visit you and you sent him out of the house in tears.\" \"He wasn't my friend,\" Max stated, rolling his eyes. Of course his mother would have mentioned the incident to his fucking shrink. \"Well regardless of that, she said that you made him cry.\" \"Yeah, so?\" Max shrugged. \"Why did you do that?\" She asked. \"Look, I didn't mean to make him cry, okay? It's not my fault he's really sensitive or whatever! He came over to my house, I didn't want him there, so I told him to leave and he got upset. He's a transfer kid, so he's like, trying to make friends or something, I guess.\" He shrugged. \"Max, I'm a trained psychiatrist,\" Danielle stated. \"I can tell when people are lying to me.\" \"Okay, so maybe I just don't want to tell you.\" Max sighed. He really didn't understand why he had to be here and do this every week. He didn't want to talk to this woman and he wasn't going to. \"Look, Max, if you don't start talking to me, your family is going to have to take further action. A lot of teenagers go through rebellious phases like this, especially when one of their parents remarries, but from what I've heard, you're out of control in both your actions and your health. There is help out there for you, but you have to be willing to accept it.\" \"I don't need help,\" Max stated. \"Yes, you do.\" Danielle looked at Max. \"What you're going through, a lot of people go through it. If you open up about it, the things that are bothering you, I can help stop them.\" \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" Max shook his head. \"No one else is going through this shit, you don't know what you're talking about at all, do you? I knew psychiatry was bullshit, but I didn't realize that it was full of little fucking liars.\" \"Max, please calm down.\" She sighed, leaning back in her chair. \"I can't understand your unique situation if you don't explain it to me. From what I can see, you're just really angry, but if there's more to it, Max, I need to know so that I can help you.\" \"Why would you want to help me?\" Max asked. \"Because you make like 200 bucks an hour off of getting me to talk? Because it'll help make you look good at your next head shrinking convention? Huh?\" He tilted his head to the side. \"I know that it's not because you care about me.\" \"How do you know that?\" Danielle asked, maintaining her calm, smooth voice. \"How do I know? Are you serious?\" Max stood up, throwing his hands in the air. \"You don't know me!\" he shouted. \"You don't know me at all, and you can't fucking care about someone that you don't know!\" \"But I'm trying to get to know you, you're shutting me out,\" Danielle countered. \"I would really like to get to know you, Max, but before I can do that, you have to decide that you want to let me get to know you.\" \"Why would you want to get to know me?\" Max challenged. \"It's because you're paid for this! You're paid to get me to spill my guts to you so that you can put it in a file and scribble down some medication name on a piece of paper, something that will get me high enough to forget about the shit that's happening! I know that you don't care about me, and you won't care about me, even if you do get to know me – in fact, you have a better chance of caring about me before you get to know me,\" he shouted. \"No one fucking cares about me and especially not people who have gotten to know me! Just ask my sister, my mom, hell, my stepdad is a prime example. He wants me out of the house, he thinks I'm a danger to their perfect fucking family! Ask them, see if they care at all about me.\" \"Max, if they didn't care about you, you wouldn't be here.\" Danielle shook her head. \"Your mother wouldn't insist that you see someone, that you get help, if she didn't love you.\" \"No, you're wrong.\" Max shook his head. \"She's got me here, she's doing this because she thinks that if she does, people will stop fucking talking about what a lunatic the Cordon boy is, about what an emo kid he is. She wants a popular son with good grades and a fucking smile on his face, a son who's happy to have some deadbeat taking his father's place, and when she found out that wasn't me, she sent me here.\" He sat back down on the couch, folding his arms across his chest. \"Wow.\" Danielle made notes quickly. \"How do you feel right now?\" She asked, looking up at Max. \"I don't know.\" Max shrugged. He felt worn out and his voice felt sore, but having finally said all of those things out loud, it kind of actually made him feel a little bit better, though he knew that he wasn't going to admit it. \"Tired, mostly,\" he lied. \"Okay.\" Danielle nodded. \"You can be done for today if you want to be,\" she said softly. \"But the hour's not up,\" Max stated. \"You can go early. If you want to stay and talk, of course you're welcome to, but if you want, you can go home now.\" \"Well fuck that.\" Max stood up, grabbing his hoodie and iPod, heading out of the door. He wasn't aware of just how much he had opened up to his therapist, but he was aware of the fact that he felt a little better, a little calmer. Granted, he didn't trust Danielle farther than he could throw her, but she had gotten him angry enough to tell the truth, and that was something. It scared him, but at the same time, relieved him. He got on the bus and grabbed one of the rails, not caring that there was no place to sit. He was about halfway home before a splitting pain arose in his head. He cried out, pressing his hand to his forehead, but it did no good. A second latter, another stabbing pain shot through his head and collapsed to the ground, seizing. \"Max…\" he heard far off voices talking to him – Carol and KW. \"Max, we need you…\" \"No, no you don't!\" Max shouted as writhed on the ground. \"Leave me alone! You don't need me! Leave me alone, just let me be!\" \"Max, only you can save us!\" Alexander's voice said. The pain in his head seemed to worsen, and that, combined with the seizing became too much for him. He shrieked in pain, gripping at his head for a couple of minutes, trying to block the voices before, for the third time, he fell unconscious.

This story takes place 2 months after Kara has returned to Argo City with the Omegahedron. Having tasted life as a human, she longs for the excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longing for the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness of their daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her go visit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earth proves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more about the people she had once left behind. Returning To Earth Kara lay in bed looking at the group picture that Jimmy Olsen had taken at Popeye's. They all looked so happy and carefree and she knew that they were probably wondering why she had never tasted fried chicken before. The picture was taken a half hour before the runaway tractor, before she saved and met the man who woke up her feelings of young love. Setting the picture on her chest she closed her eyes and tried to recall Ethan's eyes, smiling at her, his lips saying he loved her. She could not help but wonder if he still remembered Linda Lee and her alter ego Supergirl. He had found out her secret before she returned to Argo and she wished that she had more time to be able to get to know him and her human friends. Jut like Zaltar had told her when he was still living, humans were indeed a very complex breed of creature. She had met a few of the lunatics like Selena, and made friends like Jimmy and Lucy. Earth was truly a magical place where everything had life and excitement. She felt alive while she was there. Now, back at Argo, she missed her adventures on the planet and wished for more. She dozed off to sleep with these ideas running through her mind. Alura watched her daughter toss and turn on the bed through the door port. Once again she was having a fitful night of sleep and seemed to be calling out to someone. A person she did not know. \"Ethan!\" She heard her daughter giggle as if she was being tickled. \"Lucy, this shirt is wonderful!\" Indeed, Kara had changed since she came back from Earth. Her moods switched from melancholic carefree all the time. Alura was sure that her daughter missed the planet and its people. But, would it be safe to send Kara back for a visit if Kal-El was a trillion miles away still trying to get that peace treaty signed? Kara had told her about the powers that she developed while she was there. Maybe the visit would do Kara some good. Zor-El, Kara's father agreed that the trip to her cousin's planet changed their daughter for the better. After recovering the Omegahedron for Argo City, Kara now displayed a more mature outlook in her life. Although still filled with her adventurous and fun loving nature, she now also proved to be a responsible member of the House of El. After seeing how the omegahedron could be abused by non Kryptonians, Kara seemed to have appointed herself the guardian of the orbs that provided their city with life sustenance. She never wanted her city to lose the orb again. She worked closely with her father to make sure that it would never again be \"borrowed\" by anybody the way Zaltar had done in the past. A \"borrowing\" that almost cost the city inhabitants their lives. As responsible as she had become, nothing changed the fact that Kara was also a young lady who needed to learn more about life and the world beyond Argo City. Alura and Zor-El both knew that eventually, the power sources for Argo would run out. Zaltar had estimated a 20 year life span for the power sources and they were now a year away from that deadline. Kara would be forced to start a new life for herself without them beyond the inner space they lived in now. It was only logical that they allow Kara to return to Earth for a few days so that she could continue to establish ties on the planet that could help her in the future. Classes had ended at the small Kryptonian school that the parents on the planet had established to help teach the children who were born in the new city about their home planet and lessons that were of vital importance to every Kryptonian. Now would be the best time to send Kara back to Earth for a while. As Kara and Alura cleared out what remained of Zaltar's quarters, her mother told her of her impending return to the planet. \"It will only be for 3 days. Your father believes the vacation will do you well.\" She could not believe her luck. Kara had resigned herself to never returning to Earth since she destroyed the podcraft when she first landed on the planet. \"Much as I would like to return mother, I have no way to do so. I can only fly when exposed to the yellow sun.\" she replied trying to hold back her smile. \"Your father has made the proper arrangements. You leave in the morning.\" 3 Argo days are equivalent to 7 Earth days. Plenty of time for Kara to once again assume her identity of Linda Lee and assimilate once again with the Earthlings. Kara wished that she had some way to get in touch with Lucy Lane before she got back. She doubted that the Midvale School For Girls would allow her to \"attend school\" after all this time. She would need a place to stay and the only other place she knew on Earth was Selena's abandoned carnival. There was absolutely no way she was going to stay there. She had no idea how to reach Ethan either. On the day of her departure, her parents accompanied her to the launching pad to help her prepare for take off. \"Turn on this monitor as you approach Earth and input the name of the person you want to find. I already scanned your friends pictures into the computer for pinpoint matching accuracy. \" Zor- el instructed Kara. The monitor was equipped to help the hyper-pod land at the closest area to the person Kara wants to meet. \"Wear the wrist version when you disembark and never lose it. It is the only way to make the craft visible to you and will allow you to re-enter it. And don't forget to turn on the cloaking switch before you leave the craft. You know how humans are afraid of aliens and alien invasion. Try not to destroy this hyper-pod like you did the first one.\" she was warned. \"Where shall I place this?\" her mother asked holding up the familiar red and blue skirt suit that Kara first wore on Earth. \"In case you need it.\" With everything in order,and a wish of a safe vacation for their daughter, her parents disembarked from the craft and the doors sealed Kara safely inside. Finally, Kara excitedly began her trek back to Earth.[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Keeps withinnthe Supergirl movie (1984) universe. Summary: This story takes place 2 months after Kara has returned to Argo Citynwith the Omegahedron. Having tasted life as a human, she longs fornthe excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longingnfor the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness ofntheir daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her gonvisit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earthnproves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more aboutnthe people she had once left behind. A Lovely Surprise Thenhyper-pod came to soft landing in a grassy area of the forest nearestnthe lake where Kara had emerged from for the first time as Supergirl.nAfter donning her earth clothes under her alter ego uniform, shenbegan locating her friends using the monitor. She spoke the name LucynLane into the microphone and almost immediately the familiar face ofnher friend came up on screen. \"Lucy Lane. Currentnlocation: Midtown mall in the town center of Midvale. Approximately 2nminutes by flight.\" the computer relayed. \"Transferringninformation to remote tracer.\" \"Next trace, Ethan.\"nshe instructed. \"There is no Ethan on file. Please repeatninquiry.\" Of course he wasn't on file. He was not in the picturenZor-el had scanned. His only image was the one she carried with hernin her mind. How was she going to find him? Where was he? Had he leftnMidvale? Would her heart break a second time? Leaving him onnEarth to return to Argo was hard enough for her. When he touched hernface at the mountain castle after her long battle with Selena, shenhad almost lost her will to return home and help her people. Maybenthat was love? She felt like her return to earth was a complete wastenalready. Setting the thoughts aside, she reminded herself that shenwas there to do more than just see Ethan. He was not the mission.nWell, okay, he was half the mission. It would be nice to learn morenabout this thing he called love. After snapping the braceletnonto her wrist, Kara hurriedly stepped out of the pod and had justnflown up when she looked back and saw the pod still appearing beforenher eyes. Flying down closer, she pressed the red button on thenbracelet and saw the pod magically vanish before her eyes. \"Nownto find Lucy.\" She seemed to just blink before she found herselfnhovering over Midtown mall. Using her x-ray vision, she spotted Lucynsitting among friends in the foodcourt. Kara would have to hurry ifnshe wanted to meet her, they seemed to be almost finished eating. Shenhoped that after the events at Selena's mountain castle, Lucy wouldnhave kept in touch with Ethan and she could help her find him. Afternspeed changing into normal clothes, she joined the rest of the crowdnin boarding the elevator down to the foodcourt. She got pushed to thenback of the well crowded cubicle. A normal person would have feltncrushed by the number of people inside but not Kara, they felt likendown pillows pressed against her. She wondered why she felt the fanninduced air in the cubicle passing under her feet. Looking down, shensaw the floor had a space between her feet and the place where thenboards should have met. She was floating! Holding on to the railingnbehind her she pulled herself down and held on till she got to hernfloor. She checked to see if anybody noticed and saw a little girlnwhose hand was being held by mother and the other holding an icencream cone staring at her open mouthed. Kara smiled at the child andnwaved to show she meant no harm. The door finally opened onnher floor. People spilled out into all directions while Karanhurriedly walked in the direction of Lucy's table. She could alreadynhear her friends shrill voice over all of the people there, and shenwasn't even using her super hearing. \"Mommy, mommy! Thatngirl flew in the elevator!\" the little girl excitedly saidnpointing to Kara. \"No honey, there is no such thing as anSupergirl, only a Superman.\" the mother said tugging on thenchild. Kara had used her laser vision to cut her hairnhopefully back to the bob cut that she had a few months back. Now,namong the earthlings, she was Linda Lee again, cousin to Clark Kent,nand an orphan. Just as before, her human form sported jet black hairnand a shy, uncertain demeanor. Lucy could not believe her eyesnas she saw the woman walking towards her. It had been almost 3 monthsnsince her room mate suddenly disappeared on her. Supergirl had simplynexplained it as Linda needing to go home in a hurry. But she thoughtnLinda had no home. She was supposed to be an orphan. And yet, therenwas no mistaking the identity of the person walking towards her, anbeaming smile on her face. \"Hello Lucy. Do you remembernme?\" \"Ill be darned! Linda! Linda Lee! Where did youndisappear to? Where are you staying? Who are you staying with?\"nshe motioned for her friend to get the new girl a seat. \"Heyneverybody! This is my former room mate, Linda Lee.\" Thesengathering sessions of humans often confused Kara. She could notnunderstand how they could understand each others thoughts whenneveryone was speaking at the same time and almost shouting to getnthemselves heard. In her mind everything was difficult to comprehendnand she was most thankful to have her super hearing that helped herndiscern who was saying what. Eventually, the group broke up and Lucynand Linda were left to talk on their own. \"Supergirl saidnyou had to go home suddenly. I thought your parents were dead?\"nLucy asked as they walked along the mall window shopping. \"Theynare. Supergirl is a friend of mine, I had her deliver the message. Inwent home to my cousins to fix some things about my family affairs.n\" \"You went home to Clark?\" Lucy queriednfurther as she pulled Linda into one of the stores to look atndresses. \"No. Some other cousins in Metropolis. \"nLinda replied going along. Lucy seemed to try on every dressnat the store and Linda did not have the heart to tell her that notnall the clothes she tried on looked good on her. When Lucy caught herneyeing one dress in particular, she insisted that Linda try it on.nThe white summer dress fit her to a T. \"You have to buynit.\" Lucy prodded her. \"No. I can't. I do not havenmoney.\" Linda explained as she took the dress off. \"So?nGet a job. That is what I am doing this summer.\" \"Anjob? Summer? You are not studying?\" \"Linda, I amnbeginning to wonder about what happened to you when you disappeared.nDon't you remember? Summer vacation. No classes.\" \"Sonyou aren't staying at the school right now?\" This was somethingnnew about the humans that she was learning. \"Nope. I amnstaying at home with my folks. Lois says she might come home for anvisit but we really doubt that because she on assignment in Paris. Ohndid you know that Clark took 3 months sabbatical from the DailynPlanet?\" Clark was the alter ego of Kal-El on earth. So,nKara would not meet her cousin afterall. Her parents would bendisappointed. They had hoped that she would meet him and learn aboutnlife on the planet from him. \"Yes, I did. I think he isnsuffering from writer's block or something.\" she feigned. \"Henis out of the country as far as I know.\" \"Anyway,nback to the dress. We can have it placed on lay away and you can comenwith me now to apply for a job at Frostee Burgers. You can pay fornthe dress from your salary.\" \"Frostee Burgers?nSalary?\" \"Linda!!!\" This was going to bentough. She had no idea what a salary or a job was because on ArgonCity, the omegahedron provided for all of their needs and nobodynexcept the scientists seemed to do anything else but wait for thensupplies that the omegahedron provided for them. \"I'll gonwith you Lucy.\" she was sure her father would be pleased to knownabout how she learned about Frostee Burgers, what a job is, and whatna salary is for. ********** Frostee Burgers turned outnto be an eatery that most of the teenagers of Midvale hung out atnduring their free time. Lucy told her that most of the kids thatnworked there usually came from families around the town. Since it wasnlocated inside the shopping mall, it was a very busy eatery. Thenmanager of the place was a young man who was probably no older thannLucy and Linda. Somehow he reminded Linda of Ethan. Ethan. Hernheart felt pain. Why? She had an urgent need to see him. But wherenwas he? Where would she start to look for him? The guy's namenwas Dean. He had a body builder's body and well chiseled facialnfeatures. He seemed to know Lucy and he hired Linda on the spotnbecause, according to him, Lucy said hiring Linda was worth it. \"Wenstart at 11 AM sharp tomorrow. Do you want me to pick you up or willnyou meet me here instead?\" Lucy wanted to know as they exitednthe mall. \"I'll meet you here instead.\" Lindanreplied remembering her father's warning about humans and alien spacenships. The last thing Linda needed was for Lucy to freak out at thensight of the hyper-pod. \"Okay. Say, where are you stayingntonight?\" \"I've got a place. Don't worry aboutnit.\" \"See you tomorrow then. I go down this way.\"nLucy indicated the road to the left of them. \"See you. Inam going this way.\" Linda headed straight ahead. As soonnas she was sure that nobody was looking, the Supergirl outfit came onnand up into the sky Kara went. She was very tired by the time she gotnback to the hyper-pod. Alura had packed some Krptonian food for hernto eat. It was lonely eating alone. Her parents thought it best tonnot give her a communicator to reach them so that she would not blownher cover. She felt so alone and afraid. This work thing wasnsomething new and she hoped she could pull it off. ********** Whennassignments were handed out at the start of their shift, Lucy gotnassigned to the kitchen while Linda got counter duty. \"Bringnon the pimples!\" Lucy declared as she fired up the burner andnplaced round slabs of beef patties onto it. Linda's job wasneasy enough, take down the order, prepare it on the tray, take thenmoney and give the change. The cash register would do all thencalculating for her. A good thing since she knew nothing about thenAmerican Dollar. As the lunch crowd began to pack in, it tooknall of Linda's efforts not to use her super speed in serving thenclients. She was beginning to feel the strain though as the demandsnof the clients began to pile up. From extra tissues to extra catsup,nLinda was beginning to understand why Lucy said that working was \"anvery learning experience for us kids. Or at least that is what mynparents said.\" Finally, the crowd was gone and Linda hadnsome time to breathe and rest. She was just about to go into the restnarea at the back when the now familiar door opening bell rang.nWithout even looking up she automatically got the tray from under thencounter, placed the designated number of napkins and catsup packetsnon the tray, picked up the order pad and took the pencil from behindnher ear. \"Thank you for coming to Frostee Burgers, hownmay I serve you?\" She absentmindedly flipped the pad to the nextnclear sheet. \"Linda?\" the young man's voice made hernskin hairs stand on end. Could it be? \"Linda? I can'tnbelieve it!\" Linda began to feel hot under her uniform as thenidentity of the voice began to sink into her. She suddenly feltnovercome by giddyness, shyness, and excitement all at once. Shenlooked up from the pad. The young man leaned across the counter andngrabbed her, kissing her with all the might of a man who pined for anlost love. By the miracle of Kryptonian gods, she had found Ethan.[Chapter 3] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs for the excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longing for the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness of their daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her go visit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earth proves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more about the people she had once left behind. Questions And Answers Allura and Zor-El had the capability to monitor Kara remotely using the wrist computer that she wore as a bracelet. Watching her on the monitor from their home in Argo City, they could not help but smile as they watched their daughter engage in the human act of reciprocating love. \"I did not realize that she was on Earth long enough to make an intimate friend.\" Allura said as she watched the screen in amazement. \"I think she is too young to engage in such human acts.\" Zor-el was intently watching the screen. More concerned about the man who had his only daughter, the last daughter of the House Of El, in his tight grip. His concern was more for his daughter's welfare during this trip. He had hoped that Kara would fall for a fellow Kryptonian from another ruling house. Judging by what he saw on screen, it seemed his daughter had other plans. \"Should we let this continue or send her home immediately?\" Allura was concerned that such activities would make Kara too human to remain on Argo much longer. \"Let her stay. You and I both know that this training is of vital importance to her future survival.\" \"But....\" \"Listen to me Allura, the time will soon come when Kara will be left without a choice. She must learn how to handle herself and make decisions on her own.\" \"She needs our guidance at this point.\" the monitor showed that the people in the restaurant were starting to clap at the scene unfolding before them. \"We will always be with our daughter. But the last daughter of the House of El must be prepared when the time comes. We may not want it to happen, but we cannot prevent it.\" \"Are you sure that Zaltar's prophecy holds true?\" \"The power sources are displaying the signs. There is no mistaking it. It will be upon us sooner than we expect and there is no way we can prepare for it.\" Allura pulled her eyes off the screen and wept. \"Oh my poor child.\" ********** Linda felt light headed as she allowed Ethan to touch her lips with his own. She instinctivly grabbed for the counter in case she started to float again. She slowly relaxed her grip and allowed one of her arms to wrap around Ethan's neck. She was not going to deny him this moment, a moment she too had long dreamed of returning to. The hoot calls and clapping in the restaurant brought them both back to reality. Lucy poked her head from behind the kitchen area to see what what going on. Dean came out of his office where he was working on the supply order sheet for the next day. \"Linda Lee ! Stop that immediately!\" Dean barked at her. \"You go Linda!\" Lucy encouraged her friend. Waving the spatula in the air. The noise penetrated the deep recesses of her mind, where she felt safe and secure. Remembering the first time Ethan planted a kiss on her in the grassy area after she had saved him from the tractor claw. She pushed him away a bit too hard. Ethan flew over a table and crashed into a vacant seat. \"Ethan! I am so sorry. Did I hurt you?\" Linda threw down the pad and pencil, and with a giant leap over the counter, made her way to him. Totally forgetting all the warnings of her parents about using her powers in public. Her only concern at the moment was that she could have possibly severely damaged a person who was special to her. He got up from the chair and started massaging his neck. \"Nothing a neck brace won't fix.\" \"Linda, we do not go around assulting our customers!\" Dean said loudly. She waved him off \"It's okay. He is a friend of mine.\" \"Take is easy next time will you Linda?\" Ethan said with a smile that would brighten the darkest Argo night. He crawled to his feet and headed back to the counter. \"Back to work everybody! The show is over.\" Dean barked. Lucy and the others went back into the kitchen while Linda resumed her post. After preparing Ethan's order, she tallied up his bill. \"$7.50\" she held out her hand for his payment. He placed a $10 bill in her hand and pulled her closer to him. \"What time do you get off? Can I wait for you?\" he whispered. \"4:00. You can wait if you want.\" \"I'll eat slow.\" ********** \"What was that all about?\" Lucy asked as she and Linda finally took a break. \"You remember Ethan.\" Linda replied as she tasted her first soft serve ice cream sundae. One of the perks of the job was having one free meal of any kind. This was her chance to familiarize herself with human food. She did not have time to even taste the fried chicken Lucy had ordered for her the first time. \"I remember him from the time when Selena tried to take over Midvale. But I don't recall ever seeing the two of you together.\" \"I met him over the 3 day week-end. Remember? I stayed in school. He was the grounds keeper.\" \"Oh. That explains a lot. But the lip lock?\" Lucy bit into her Bacon burger. \"That is a long and confusing story.\" 'Look Linda, you are my friend and I do not want to see you get hurt. But he seems much older than you.\" \"Older than me?\" \"He is at least 21. I don't know if Clark would approve of it.\" \"Lucy, don't read so much into it. We are just friends.\" \"Friends don't let their friends kiss them that way. Something is going on with the two of you Linda Lee.\" Lucy teased. ********** Ethan had never gotten the sudden disappearance of Linda on that day. Even though he told Supergirl that he knew about Linda, he had to admit that he did not know anything about her. If his doubts were true or not. He tried to put her out of his mind by growing his gardening business and attending college at the same time. This was his way of preparing in case she actually did return to his life. He wanted to be worthy of the boarding school girl who stole his heart and took it with her, wherever it was that she disappeared to. He had never eaten so slow in his life. The manager had been throwing him dagger looks as his tray cleared and he made no move to leave the table. Instead, he got up and ordered some coffee, with the free refills. Dean glared at him as he returned to his table with the drink, he would be there all day. Linda was clearing tables and cleaning the trays already. She was refilling sugar jars and straw holders. Each movement seemed like a ballet dance to her. One fluid movement after another that he forced himself to commit to memory. In case he never saw her again. 4:00 finally rolled around and Lucy joined them for a short walk to the movie house in the mall. She had a date with Jimmy Olsen and she was sure that he would be glad to see Ethan and Linda again. Since they all shared that horrific Selena episode in their lives. Lucy vowed never to attend another carnival again for as long as she lived. \"Care for some dinner? Or do you just want to walk?\" he asked Linda after the greetings had been done and the group broke up. 'Whatever you want to do. I don't really have any plans.\" \"Let's walk to the park. Talk. Get to know each other. I have so many questions for you.\" \"I might not be able to answer them all.\" she feared that there would be no explaining Supergirl. She remembered what he had told her that day she left him. \"I know about Linda.\" he softly whispered to her before she took flight. They stopped to buy a hotdog sandwich and a soda from the park vendor. Linda watched intently as she learned how to buy a sandwich from Ethan without giving away that she was clueless about how to do such things. Sitting in on the grass in the middle of the park, Ethan kept staring at her as she devoured her hotdog. \"What's wrong?\" she asked licking her lip. \"I just can't believe how lucky I am. After all this time, I tried to look for you. I thought you were just around Midvale.\" \"You said you knew about me. I thought you understood.\" \"I understood you were special. I did not understand that you were leaving me for good.\" \"I am here now.\" \"Yes. You are here now, that is all that matters.\" he crumpled his soda can and threw it aside, obviously trying to forget something that had occurred to him. \"Is something wrong? You seem distracted. Can I help?\" she asked wiping her mouth with the table napkin. \"No Linda, this is one time you can't help me.\" he stared into the night as if he was at his wits end. \"It's late. I have to be at work tomorrow.\" Linda got up and held her hand out to help him up. \"Okay. I'll see you home.\" \"No, don't bother. Linda can take care of herself remember?\" \"But I want to...\" \"Ethan, do I have to drop a coconut on your head?\" she giggled remembering the first time she flew away with him unconscious in a bump car. \"Linda...\" \"Kara says Linda will be fine.\" She said trying to muster up an authoritative voice. \"Okay, okay. You don't need to get all Kara on me. Do me a favor though?\" He asked pulling her closer to him. She tilted her head instinctivly. \"What?\" \"Let me see you again?\" he took her hands and held it to his chest. She felt her heart throbbing against her chest. He wanted to see her again and it made her feel special. She just knew she was beginning to blush. \"Tomorrow. Let's have dinner. Pick me up at Frostee's?\" \"I'll be there.\" She slowly pulled away from him and walked into the trees. He heard a loud boom and looked up into the sky. \"There goes my girl\" he smiled to himself. Kara floated all over the hyper pod that night. Her emotions getting the better of her. She was too happy to realize that she was floating above her bed with a smile on her face. ********** Ethan walked back to the mall and picked up his motorcyle from the parking building. He was late getting home and he was not in the mood to have to explain himself to anybody. He was too happy. Linda was finally back in his life. Parking the motorcyle infront of his apartment building, he made his way up to his unit. Unlocking the door, he heard the familiar sound of cooking coming from the kitchen. \"Is that you honey? Dinner will be ready in 10 minutes love. You have time for a shower.\" came Jenna's voice from the kitchen. \" You know what honey? I am not so hungry. I ate before coming home. I just need a shower and sleep right now. I'll see you in the morning\" he replied.[Chapter 4] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs fornthe excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longingnfor the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness ofntheir daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her gonvisit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earthnproves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more aboutnthe people she had once left behind. Loven& Heartbreak Ethanntossed and turned in his bed all night trying to understandneverything that had happened to him that day. He had spent a betternpart of the 2 months after Linda had left trying to rebuild himself .nHe was a mess after she left. His business almost failed and he tooknto the bottle at every chance. Nobody wanted to believe his talenabout there being a Supergirl and that she mingled with humans justnlike any other person. Eventually he thought he must have been losingnhis mind. After all, no girl would just up and leave a guy hangingnthe way Linda did. He knew that when he first met her, he was undernthe love spell that Selena had cast to ensnare him into becoming hernlove slave. But he saw Linda first. Speaking in sonnets andnShakespearean lines, he wondered if it was just the spell that madenhim fall for her. Did any of that happen at all? \"Linda,nLinda... Don't go. No, Kara!\" he called out as he slept. Hisnmemories of their first meeting haunting him no end. His armsnflailing and reaching out to someone who was not there. Jennanflicked the desk lamp on and tried to wake him. They had met a weeknafter Linda had left him a broken man at the mountain castle. She wasnthe bartender at the club he frequented to try and forget about whatnhe had experienced. This was the same bar that he tried to seeknshelter in when the mystical tractor of Selena tried to capture him.nThe bar facade was completely destroyed and needed to be rebuilt. Henoften found himself there as he supplied it with daily floralnarrangements. He often stayed after deliveries to try andnerase the memories with bottle after bottle of beer. When he got toondrunk one night, she took him home and tried to help him sober upnfrom that moment on. He eventually allowed her to move in with him onnthe condition that she would be acting as his \"sponsor\" tonstop him from drinking after she was evicted from her apartment. Thendeal was that she could stay until she got a new place. He gave hernthe couch pull-out bed to sleep on but somehow they ended up sharingnhis bed anyway. Sharing his bed without any intimacies that is.nSomehow, even with Linda long gone, he could not bear to benunfaithful to her memory and this was his way of honoring it. Jennanhad other ideas though. Even though she was sure she was in love withnhim, she knew he did not feel the same way. Every time she thoughtnthey had made a connection, he would push her away. There wasnsomething about this woman who left him that she could not competenwith. It was a memory that hung over their budding relationship. Shenhad hoped that by coaxing him to open up to her about what henexperienced, she would find a key towards winning him. Hencould not tell her about what happened to him at first. But later onnshe heard his story and could not believe it herself. Over time, shenbelieved that she had convinced him that Supergirl never existed, thenreality was only Superman. Although he told her he was over that partnof his life, there were times that he would dream and speak aloud.nEach time that happened, she was crushed inside. Tonight was nonexception. \"Ethan, wake up! Wake up!\" she shook himnto consciousness. \"Linda!\" he screamed opening hisneyes. For a moment he saw her on the bed next to him. He dove in tonkiss her. Jenna pushed him away. \"There you go again!nWhat will it take to convince you that Linda is not real? There is nonLinda, there is no Kara. \" she wailed. Although she didnnot know it, one of the reasons that Ethan allowed her to move in wasnthat she shared some physical characteristics with eyesnwere the same intoxicating shade of blue. They shared the same hairnand skin color, and physical build as well. But Jenna was a selfnassured woman who knew what she wanted in life and fought to have it.nLinda was meek and did not have a clue about life. What wasnactually bothering Ethan was that he loved Linda without knowingnanything about her. He was sure that the first time he saw her, whennhe was under the love spell, it was black magic at work. He hadncaught up with Nigel later on and he explained that the spell shouldnhave broken when he cracked the walnut open and let the spider out.nBut Linda still occupied his every thought and waking moment. So itnmust be love. \"I know you don't believe me Jenna, butnLinda and Kara do exist. They are one person.\" he tried tonexplain as he got out of bed and headed to the kitchen to grab anbeer. \"If she exists then where is she Ethan? Show her tonme. Let's get this over with!\" Jenna kicked the covers offnexasperatedly and followed him. \"We are not arguing aboutnthis Jenna. Just let me be alright? I need the space right now.\"nHe grabbed his jacket and keys as he headed out thendoor. ********* \"I know you like this guy a lotnLinda but I really think that you are going too fast into thisnrelationship. You barely know him. What do you know about him? I meannthe most we both know about him is that he was the school groundsnkeeper and he was there at Selena's castle. That does not sound likenmuch of a personal history to me.\" Lucy discussed with Linda asnthey changed into the uniforms in the locker room. \"Therenare some things that you don't know about him. Like how he likes tonrecite poems and the fact that he is very concerned about me. I justnknow instinctively that he is a good person. I can trust him.\"nLinda tried to explain while trying to figure out how to tie up thenapron. She had kitchen duty today and she was trying to not let onnthat she had never seen a stove in her life. Lucy had foundnLinda strange the day that she showed up at the dorm room and evennmore when she put her bra on the outside of her school uniform. Itnwas pretty obvious that Linda had a very sheltered upbringing. Shenthought that maybe her friend was raised in a cult or something. Butnshe was Clark's cousin so that would not be possible. Anyway, shenknew that Linda had nobody to watch out for her in Midvale and Lucynwas not just about to let her fall flat on her face without anwarning. It was perhaps the meddlesome Lane blood in her. \"Justnmake sure you don't let him all the way into you just to get to knownyou.\" she warned. \"What do you mean?\" \"You'llnfind out. Time to get to work\" she slammed the locker theynshared shut and pushed Linda out the door. Working in thenkitchen was a new experience for Linda. She enjoyed the smell of thenfood cooking on the grill, the lessons she learned in how to make thenperfect burger or sandwich, and most of all, she learned that shencould also cook at home. According to Lucy, she should try itnsometime. All women cook. Today was a busy day for thenrestaurant. All the employees were also excited about something. Theynseemed very happy. \"Pay day today Linda. We should getnyour dress before your date.\" Lucy told her when they went onntheir break. \"Is this when we get our salary? I can buynthe dress now?\" \"Linda, I really wonder what planetnyou come from sometimes.\" Lucy rolled her eyes at her friendnwhile she stuffed a handful of french fries into her mouth. \"ArgonCity.\" Linda unconsciouly replied as her thoughts trailed off tonEthanland. \"What?\" \"What? I did not saynanything. Are you eating that?\" she said grabbing the picklenfrom the tray and putting it into her mouth. She choked on thensourness of it. Lucy handed her the soda glass to wash thentaste away while shaking her head. This was going to be a long nightnfor her innocent friend. ********** \"C'mon Linda !nWe got to get to my house, get you ready, and get you back herenbefore 7 PM.\" Lucy hurried her friend as Linda lagged behindnwith the dress bag, a new pair of shoes, and other matchingnaccessories that Lucy insisted she needed to complete the outfit.nLinda had spent half her salary by the time Lucy was donencoordinating her outfit. Jumping into Lucy's car, they joinednthe rush hour traffic in the city and immediately got stuck in thensame spot for the next half hour. There was absolutely no way theynwould make it to and from in time the way things were going. \"Inhave to go make a phone call. Tell Ethan I will be late.\" shentold Lucy. They had passed a phone booth a few meters back. It wasnjust an excuse since Linda had no idea how to use a telephone but shenhad heard some girls saying it at the restaurant and figured she hadnto remember it just in case. \"Go ahead. Traffic doesn'tnlook like it will be moving soon. But if it does, just walk down thisnroad and I will park somewhere alongside to wait fornyou.\" \"Ok.\" Linda ran normally to thentelephone booth but ran into the bushes behind it instead of inside.nWith one super spin she had ditched the human clothes and was now innher familiar red and blue outfit. Launching herself into the air, shenspotted Lucy's car in the crowded street and landed beside her. Thenpeople in the nearby cars gawking at her and wondering who or whatnshe was. She knocked on the car window to catch Lucy'snattention. \"Linda got in touch with me. I lent her a handnand took her to your house already. Would you mind if I flew the carnas well? Seems the two of you are in a rush.\" Lucy had givennLinda her address on paper and she used the remote tracer to plot thenfastest route to the house before hand. Lucy started spoutingngibberish and then decided that a simple nod of the head would be ansufficient answer. She was home in the blink of anneye. ********** Linda could not help but stare atnherself in the mirror. She could not believe how different she lookednin the empire waist dress that Lucy picked out for her. It was stillnwhite in color but properly accessorized now with the fancy jewelsnthat they had picked out at the store. This was a far cry from thenburlap type gowns that she wore back on Argo. \"You looknlike a princess Linda.\" Lucy told her as she smoothed out thenlines of the dress for her friend. There was a knock on thendoor. It was Mr. Lane. \"Are you girls ready?\" he wasngoing to drive them back to the mall to drop Linda off. \"Almostnready dad.\" \"Coming Mr. Lane. Thank you so much forndriving us back.\" Mrs. Lane stopped them at the door withnher Polaroid camera in hand. \"You can't go on your firstndate without a picture souvenier Linda. Get back up on those steps.\"nMrs. Lane handed her the picture as it developed. The processnreminded Kara of the holographic technology they had on Argo butnthought it was best she did not mention it. ********* \"Infeel under dressed.\" Ethan said when he saw how fantastic Lindanlooked that night. He was just planning to take her out for pizza andna movie but looking at her now, he knew that he had to make thisnnight very special for both of them. \"Are we havingnhotdogs again? I like hotdogs.\" she told him as he took her handnand led her to the promenade area of the mall. That is where all thennice restaurants were located. \"Nope. Tonight we willnhave something special. How do you like Italian?\" \"Indon't know. I never had it.\" \"Then you shall have itntonight.\" he led her into Restaurante Pesto and signaled thenreceptionist for a table for 2. Having never seen spaghettinnoodles in her life, she thought that he was making her eat worms andnpushed the plate away when it was served. He had to show her how toneat it and reassured her that it was not going to turn into worms.nSelena was too deep in the Phantom Zone to do them any harm now.nLinda slowly relaxed as the night progressed. She felt happy andncontent. She also knew the feeling would not last. She had to leavenin 2 days. How would she tell him that? Could she tell him that? Thenrest of the night was spent cuddling in the park and sharing kisses.nKisses that would have to last Kara a lifetime since she knew thatnher father would not allow her to go back to earth after thisnvacation. As they sat on the park bench not far from where thenhyper pod was located she nestled into his arms and tried to figurenout how to say what had to be said. \"Ethan, I have to asknyou something.\" \"Ask away.\" He replied touchingnher hair. \"All of this, what we are doing, is this whatnlove is all about?\" \"Part of it. Love is an ongoingnprocess. It is something that grows over time. Yeah. You might saynthis is love. But the early stages. It gets better.\" \"Evennbetter than what I am feeling now?\" she looked up to him andnreceived his kiss. \"A thousand times better.\" Hendraped his jacket over her, thinking she was cold when shenshuddered. This was going to be even harder than she thought.nShe could not tell him. They would both suffer if she told him thisnsoon. She chose to close her eyes and remain still in his armsninstead. It did not take long for them to fall asleep. Ansudden flash of light disturbed Ethan's slumber. He was blinded whennhe suddenly opened his eyes. He tried to focus on the image ofnJenna's hysterical voice as she aimed the flashlight directly intonhis eyes. Linda jerked out of his arms and sat upright. A look ofnwonder on her face as Jenna berated her for whatever reason. \"Shutnup Jenna!\" Ethan warned her, getting up from his seat andnpulling her away from Linda. More for Jenna's protection thannanything else. \"You man stealer! Who the hell do younthink you are? Are you even from around here? Why don't I know you?\"nshe continued to scream at Linda. \"Ethan, who is she?\"nLinda called out confused. \"She's nobody Linda. Waitnright there for me. Stay there!\" \"I am nobody?nNobody! I live with you and take care of you, and I am nobody??? Inlive with him! He is my man!\" She stared as they walkednaway from her. What had happened? If Ethan already had a woman, whynwas he acting that way around her? Why did he arouse these emotionsnin her? She felt a stabbing pain in her chest and the strangest thingnhappened. For the first time in Kara's life, tears flowed out of herneyes. She dragged herself to the invisible hyper pod door and letnherself in. She needed time to process everything that justnhappened. The one thing that she knew was that she did not wish tonsee Ethan again. Without knowing it, Kara had just experienced lovenand heartbreak all in one night. \"So, this is what lovenis all about. Love is all about being happy and being hurt at thensame time.\" she realized as she felt anguish deep within whilenwatching Ethan walk away from her without ever looking back.[Chapter 5] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Kara's return to earthnproves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more aboutnthe people she had once left behind. AnnAlien In Midvale? Karanfelt too alone and sad to sleep in the hyper-pod. She had a host ofnemotions rushing through her system and she was lost as to how tonreact to all of it. A part of her wanted to return home to Argonimmediately and never see the yellow sun of the Earth again. But shencould not bear to leave her friends the same way she did before. Thenrude realization that she had only 2 earth days left on the surfacenhit her so suddenly that she let out a pained scream. A scream thatncarried beyond the hyper-pod and carried over the nearby mountains,nrippling the still waters in the lake. Changing into hernSupergirl outfit, she launched herself into the clear night sky withna sonic boom. The tears were still stinging her eyes as she flewnwithout direction. Had she looked down even for a moment, she wouldnhave seen the small figure of Ethan, rushing back to the bench wherenhe left her. She should have also looked back before taking flight.nPerhaps she would have discovered that she forgot to cloak thenhyper-pod. It was standing in the middle of the field in full view ofnanybody who managed to walk deep into that area of the woods. Henlooked up after the sonic boom and realized that Linda had given waynto Kara. Linda or Kara, all he knew was that he loved her and hencould not bear to lose her again. He would wait all night if he hadnto. She was bound to come back. If not, he would stalk her at worknuntil she threw him out of the place. As he sat on the bench, henrecalled the conversation he had with Jenna as he dragged her out ofnthe park that night. ********** \"Who was that slutnEthan?\" Jenna angrily demanded to know. She was seething deepninside at his, what was the term? Infidelity? But they were notnmarried. Disloyalty? Unfaithfulness? Maybe. Whatever the proper termnfor it was, nothing changed the fact that he cheated on her and shenwanted to scratch the other woman's eyeballs out. \"Shenisn't a slut Jenna. I would tell you who she is but you have to calmndown first and promise to listen to me.\" He decided to FiremannCarry her over his shoulder because she kept trying to run back tonwhere Linda was. \"Just tell me Ethan! How could you hurtnme this way? You know I love you. I would do anything for you!\"nShe pushed and kicked in the air, trying to get free of hisngrip. \"Jenna, don't make this any harder on yourself. Younknow the truth. You know I never wanted to hurt you. Now sit down,ncalm down and listen to me. \" He dumped her into the next benchnthat they passed. They were far enough from where Linda was for himnto put her down. \"This better be good Ethan. You know hownI get mad.\" She seethed at him. \"Open your mindnJenna, think, who do you think that woman could be?\" He hopednthat by letting her realize the answers to her own questions, henwould avoid hurting her further. \"Who is she? I havennever met her. You always tell me about the women you meet. I knownall of them by face. All of those women except...\" her voicentrailed off at the realization. \"Exactly. Linda. That wasnLinda.\" \"Linda isn't real Ethan! How many times do Inhave to tell you that? What a great excuse. Use a fictitious personnso that I will forgive you!\" \"I don't want yournforgiveness and I am not making excuses! She is Linda and nothingnwill change how I feel about her!\" he was beginning to lose hisntemper so he stood up in front of her instead. \"How aboutnme? Your feelings for me!\" \"Jenna, we have alwaysnbeen clear about one thing. YOU have feelings for me. I never led younin any way to believe I had the same feelings for you.\" \"Butnyou let me move in! I slept in your bed.\" she pleaded with him.nTrying to bring him to his senses. \"I never touched younJenna. You know that. Nothing ever happened between us. No feelings,nno kisses, nothing. You moved yourself into my apartment and into mynbed even after I told you I had no plans of getting intimate withnyou. I never asked you to do anything for me. You knew all alongnthere was only one woman I ever wanted and needed!\" Shenbegan to sob at the realization of what was happening between them.nJenna was getting a dose of the awful truth that she tried to blindnherself to. \"Look, you can stay in the apartment till younget another place to stay. But I won't be going back there till younleave understand? I don't want to hurt Linda.\" \"Thisnis not the end of this Ethan. Linda will pay.\" \"Youndon't know anything about Linda. Leave her alone Jenna. Don't say Indid not warn you.\" He walked away from her, heading back to thenbench where he hoped Linda still waited for him. ********** Hernparents watched her with sadness once again. Even as her mother wasnpleading with Zor-El to use the emergency frequency they had encodedninto the bracelet tracker, he was constantly refusing to intervene.nIt was his belief that the situation was merely part of thenhumanizing process of their daughter. A very important step if shenwere to survive alone on a strange planet. \"We will notnalways be here for her Allura. You must understand that. If we takenher out of there now, we will deny our daughter the chance tonunderstand how human's deal with heart ache and pain. Indeed, here atnArgo City, nobody will dare hurt the Princess of the House Of El. Butnshe is not a princess on Earth.\" he reasoned as he prevented hisnwife from accessing the emergency communication switch. \"Shenneeds us Zor-El. Can't you see? She isn't ready. We should have toldnher the truth. We should have waited for Kal-El to return in order tonguide her.\" \"There is no time for that Allura. Wenwill explain everything to her when she comes back to us. In thenmeantime, we can only be observers.\" ********** \"Wherenare you going Kara?\" her bracelet computer was set to remind hernto set a destination the minute it sensed her in flight without andestination. A safety feature her father had built-in exactly fornsituations similar to this one. The idea was to train Kara to alwaysnkeep a clear head and think before taking any course of action. Shenwiped the tears away and crooked her right arm in front of her so shencould speak into the bracelet. Where was she headed? In earth time,nit was probably 11 PM already. Would the Lanes still be awake? Couldnshe drop in on Lucy? It was worth a try. \"Lane residence.nCheck for the availability of Lucy. Inform me if she isnawake.\" \"Lucy Lane is awake and dancing to music innher room. Lane residence approximately 5 minutes away.\" Lucy'snstreet still had some people walking out of their homes, taking outnthe trash and making small talk with neighbors. Kara had no choicenbut to circle the block as high as possible until the street clearednout. Once in a while, a few of them seemed to be looking up at her.nCould they actually see her? She finally landed on the sidewalk atnthe corner of Lucy's house. Changing back into the dress as she speednwalked to the house. She rang the bell and heard the voice of Mrs.nLane answer. \"Why Linda. What happened?\" Mrs. Lanenasked when she saw the tear stained face of Linda. She pulled her innfor a hug. \"Everything will be okay honey. Lucy! Get downnhere. Linda is back!\" ********** \"I knew it.nI told you he was bad news when I first saw him. Remind me to spit innhis drink the next time he comes to Frostee's.\" Lucy fumed asnthe 3 of them sat around the kitchen counter drinking their hotncocoa. \"Did the woman hurt you?\" Mrs. Lane askednchecking Linda for any markings of a fight or struggle. \"No,nno. Ethan took her away before she could do anything to me.\"nLinda related sadly. \"That jackass!\" \"Lucy!\"nMrs Lane barked disapprovingly. \"Well what else would youncall him?\" She asked her mother. \"Principal Danversnwould love to hear you talk that way.\" She frowned. Asnthe night grew deeper, it became obvious to the Lanes that Lindancould not be left alone that night. She was offered the old room ofnLois to sleep in. An offer that Linda gladly accepted. The bednwas warm and the family was welcoming and helpful. How she wished shencould live with them instead of at the cold and unfeelingnhyper-pod. ********** \"Linda! Linda! Wake upnLinda!\" Lucy knocked on her door the next morning with a hurriednexpression in her voice. Something was wrong. Linda rolled outnof bed and opened the door. She was wearing Lois' old pajamas thatnwere 2 sizes too big for her so that the shoulders were constantlynslipping off her own. \"What's going on?\" she askedntrying to rub her eyes clear of sleep. \"Jimmy was on thenphone a few moments ago. He said to turn on the TV. You won't believenwhat the police found. Jimmy is on his way here right now. He thinksnI should try and write up a report for it in the local paper.\" Thentelevision set in the living room was already on. Lucy's parents werenglued to the screen. A look of constant amazement pasted on theirnfaces. \"The space craft carries the familiar S emblem ofnSuperman on the very top. Early morning joggers came across it todaynand informed the police. As of now, there has been no activity comingnfrom the ship.\" Linda did not even have to look at the TV set tonknow that she had forgotten her father's most important edict becausenshe let her emotions get in the way. \"We have justnreceived word that the air force will be arriving soon to take thenship away to a high security facility as we await the return ofnSuperman whom they hope will be able to shed light on thensituation.\" Jimmy walked into the room at that verynmoment. Unnoticed by most of the people in the room. His attentionnalso centered on the news report. Nobody noticed Linda slip out thenback door and fly back to the scene of the problem. \"Okay,nI don't think that Superman has a moving Fortress of Solitude.\"nhe said. Lucy smacked his arm. \"The appearance of thisnship coincides with last nights reports of a woman in flight in thennight sky, similar in outfit to our beloved Superman. Today Midvalenasks \"Who is that flying woman? Is she connected with thisnship?\" \" \"We better get some breakfast readynbefore the two of you set out. Go get Linda.\" Mrs. Lane saidngetting up from her seat. \"She's right here.\" Lucynsaid turning in the direction where Linda was originallynstanding. \"Linda? Linda?\" Lucy went to check everynroom in the house. \"She's gone.\" \"Whatndo you mean she's gone?\" Jimmy asked. \"I mean shenslept here last night, came down with me this morning and justndisappeared. I tell you that is one mysterious girl. Never mind, I amnsure she will be at work later.\" ********** Karanlanded as close to the pod as she safely could without drawingnattention. Mingling with the crowd that was already circling thenspace craft, cut off by yellow tape and armed soldiers, she wonderednif she could hit the cloak button, make the ship vanish and then slipnin without anybody noticing. Arms suddenly wrapped around her waist.nIt was Ethan. \"Not a word Linda. Just come withnme.\" \"What are you doing here?\" She was stillnangry at him because of Jenna and tore his hands away without effort,npushing him away with calculated strength this time. He threw justnfar enough away from her to still keep his grip strong on hernhand. \"Trying to stop you from becoming an alien DNAnexperiment. Just follow me. Don't be a hero right now. They havengreen kryptonite handy just in case. \" She knew all aboutnthe effects of green Kyrptonite on her cousin. She did not doubt thatnit would have the same effect on her. Plus, she was sure that hernparents would not appreciate her learning a lesson about death duringnthis trip. She followed Ethan without question and was just thankfulnsomebody knew her secret and was willing to help her. \"Wenneed to find Lucy and Jimmy. And Linda, you may need to tell them thentruth.\"[Chapter 6] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs for the excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longing for the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness of their daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her go visit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earth proves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more about the people she had once left behind. A Breach In The Phantom Zome Lucy listened intently to the radio as Jimmy drove to the Midvale National Park. There was something that bothered her. The flying woman, the Supergirl, she was the one who flew Linda and Lucy the day before. Why did they know each other? Why did Supergirl seem so familiar to her? And why did Supergirl always show up only when Linda was around? \"There have also been reports that the woman everyone is now calling Supergirl was first seen yesterday picking up a car stuck in the middle of rush hour traffic and flying off with it. The woman is said to be of about 19 years of age, with long blonde hair, dressed in skirt ensemble similar to the Superman outfit \" Lucy had her suspicions since that day that Linda and Supergirl disappeared at the same time 2 months ago. Strange that they would also reappear at the same time. Until she confirmed her suspicions though, she thought it best to keep things to herself. ********** The Phantom Zone alarms resounded all throughout Argo City. Something had gone terribly wrong and a portal was slowly opening from the zone into Earth. Since the last portal that opened up was to let Kara back into Midvale, the coordinates were still set for her return. Thus leaking the Phantom Zone slowly into Earth. Zor-El was in the thick of things at The Council. He knew that Kara had banished her mortal enemy to the Phantom Zone and the portal problem now posed a security threat to his daughter's stay on earth. Everyone in the room knew of the danger Kara would be facing if the portal was not sensors indicated that witchcraft was being used to tear the portal open. A strong type of witchcraft that seemed to be sucking on the power of the Omegahedron as well. \"We need to shut down the is the only way to weaken the witchcraft so that we can intervene with the White Power. \" Zor-el insisted over all the bickering voices at the conclave. \"Shutting it down is not an option. You will recall that we all almost died when Kara lost the air thinned to the point of poisoning our systems. She barely got back in time for us to survive during the restart.\" An angered conclave member stated. \"Surely a few hours would not have such adverse effects on our population. That is truly better than letting those evil forces out of the zone.\" Zor-El reasoned as the monitor on the wall displayed a slowly enlarging red glow. Indicating the portal opening and its progress. \"We know that the evil force causing all of this now is the person your daughter banished to the zone. Obviously, she has found a way to tap into the power of the Omegahedron from that desolate place. We understand the danger she poses to Earth, as well as to Kara. But the Omegahedron power system is no longer that stable and hence, harder to control these days. In any event, we cannot afford to have a crisis should the Omegahedron fail to restart. There must be other options.\" Da- To, the council technical adviser stated. Everyone else concurred. Shutting down any other reasons Zor-El may have thought of voicing out. ********** A woman in her late 50's with matted brown hair and nails as long as barbecue sticks stood before the now partially open portal. Her eyes closed as she summoned the powers of the Alpha and the Omega to do her evil bidding, she was gesturing before the hole that seemed to bend to her ever order. It would only be a matter of time before Selena exited the portal and rained her revenge down on the woman who banished her to this forsaken place. She had survived the trek through the bogs and killer tornados, and climbed to the top of the Phantom Zone only to find the portal blocked by heavy White Magic. This was the same portal that Supergirl exited through during their battle. Selena had no doubt that the girl's white forces were strong and recognized by the portal, hence how she escaped the phantom zone. But Selena's belief in all things evil was unshakable. She was going to use every black magic summoning charm she knew to open that portal and return to Midvale, never realizing that the portal was already set to the return coordinates for Kara's hyper pod. She had lost her only friend and accomplice during this trek. Bianca had been sucked into the vortex as they climbed the cliff-side, she was always a clumsy side kick anyway. Selena needed a stronger, more determined to succeed assistant once she got out of the zone. Surely that would not be a problem for her. After all, the people of Midvale were such simpletons that any of them could become her minion with very little convincing. ********** \"Ethan please stop. We have been going around in circles for hours. Lucy isn't here yet. I could have told you that 2 rounds ago if you just let me.\" Linda pleaded with him as she sunk unto the ground to rest. The pod was still within their sight but there were almost no people where they were. \"Linda, I told you, Kara has no place here right now. It is dangerous for anybody to find out who you really are.\" He tried to explain as he squatted in front of her. \"Do you really know who I am? If you did, you would have waited for me to return.\" she asked him with hurt in her voice. \"Wait, who am I talking to right now? Kara or Linda?\" \"Does is make a difference?\" \"Not really, I love YOU, regardless of who you are because Kara or Linda, those are just names. It doesn't change what I feel for you. I just want to have a heads up in case you plan on tossing me aside and doing something super stupid like charging into the hyper pod.\" \"That is something I wanted to ask you about. You were under a spell Ethan, how can you still have loved me after it broke?\" \"I asked myself the same thing honey.\" Linda looked taken aback by his term of endearment. He took the opportunity to lie with his head on her lap. She did not fight him. \"But I spoke to Nigel about it. You remember him right? He still works at the school and we come across each other sometimes when I maintain the greens. He explained that the spell is good only for one day. But, if during that one day, the woman I was destined to fall in love with crosses my path, the spell will not have mattered. The spell will only magnify the true love that was awakened within.\" He reached up behind her neck and slowly lowered her face to his. Kissing her tenderly, he allowed her to feel the honesty of his love. That he was pure and true, not meaning to hurt her, but not knowing how to treat her either. He was now familiar with the way she always traced his lips after a kiss. The first time she did it, he thought she was just reviving him after had been knocked out by a rogue coconut courtesy of Selena after Kara helped him get away from bump cars running amok. As far as Ethan was concerned, it was a mesmerizing touch that brought him to the pinnacle of feelings he never knew existed within him. To Kara it was a Kyrptonian symbol of love, purity, and promise to the one she loved, even more special than any of the kisses they could ever share. \"Why do you always do that?\" He asked holding onto her fingers with his lips. \"Where I come from, where Kara comes from, tracing the lips signifies that I offer you my body, mind, and soul. It is a promise that I will save myself and always wait for you. No matter how long it takes.\" \"I'm saving myself for you too Kara.\" Kara, hearing her call her by her real name made her eyes well up with tears that she fought back. \"Say it again.\" \"Say what?\" \"My name.\" \"Kara.\" \"Again.\" \"Kara... Kara... Kara...\" she closed her eyes and basked in the sweetness emanating from his voice as he said her name. Her super hearing suddenly zeroed in on the voice of Jimmy, they were not too far away and were looking for traces of Superman in the area. \"They're here Ethan.\" Kara rolled him off her lap and shook herself off. 'Where?\" he looked around questioningly. He did not hear anything nor see anybody. Kara raised the bracelet \"Trace. Jimmy Olsen and Lucy Lane.\" 'Jimmy Olsen and Lucy Lane, 100 paces to the north.\" the bracelet responded. \"What the heck?\" Ethan held the bracelet arm disbelievingly infront of him. \"It's a wrist computer. Let's go.\" She walked on ahead of him. ********** Lucy interviewed most of the bystanders while Jimmy took as many pictures as he could, hoping for a Daily Planet front page. Without Lois and Superman around, he had a dry season and really needed the money such a picture would bring. As he circled the area, something in beyond the bushes caught his eye, it was a glimmer that looked like a rip in the middle of the forest. \"Lucy, c'mere.\" he tapped her should and signalled for her to follow him. \"What is it?\" \"Something in the bushes. Could be a high profile shot.\" They crept their way towards the area behind the ship. It seemed that nobody had seen it yet and they would be the first people there. \"Jimmy! Lucy!\" Linda half whispered when she saw the pair pass near the spot where she and Ethan were hiding. \"Linda! Why did you take off like that? What is that louse doing here?\" Lucy asked concernedly, eyeing Ethan with a disapproving look. \"I'll explain everything later. Right now, we need your help.\" \"What are you talking about.\" A ripping sound caught the ear of Ethan who turned to see the portal opening up, black smoke emanating from within. \"Uhhh Linda... I think we better scoot.\" \"What's wrong?\" she turned to see what he was looking at. \"Hide!\" he ordered everyone as an image slowly stepped out of the hole. \"Oh my god!\" Lucy let out a screamlet. Jimmy immediately covered her mouth to muffle the sound. She looked like a hag who had been through Iraq and back but there was no mistaking who was standing almost infront of them. Only a thick bush seperated their group from, Selena.[Chapter 7] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs for the excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longing for the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness of their daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her go visit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earth proves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more about the people she had once left behind. Selena's Revenge They watched in silent horror as Selena performed a silent incantation that slowly and eerily restored her to her former high priestess self. The same mean look in her eyes had returned, as well as the boasting carriage that can be expected of a women who considers the world hers for the taking. A chill crawled up Kara's spine as she was forced to remain motionless as her arch nemesis walked out into the open space and mixed with the people ogling the hyper-pod. Selena heard everything the people were discussing. So, the hyper-pod belonged to a super being who was not Superman. \" Velieris Mihi ! \" Selena commanded the dark forces that she felt were strong around her. She disappeared from sight and walked past the barriers, examining the craft up close, looking over the S emblem on its top as she levitated by uttering \"Levi! , looking for a way in. Indeed Selena had learned many things while she was at the Phantom Zone. The scientists and Elders of Krypton who were banished there for their crimes against Kryptonopolis were very helpful in helping her learn more about the dark side, the capabilities of the Omegahedron and how she could command the dark forces even while trapped in the zone. However, she learned how to get out of the Phantom Zone on her own. By combining what she knew of dark magic and the mystical powers of the Kryptonians, stolen from those she killed with her bare hands, she was able to disguise her true intentions and trick the white magic that guarded the zone gates. Surely there was an incantation that would open the gates of this magnificent machine. She would need to do this later, when the crowds were gone for the night. In the meantime, it was time to look for the wimp who banished her to the Phantom Zone. Indeed, Selena knew Linda's secret, and she was not going to stop until she had destroyed both Linda and Kara. She no longer wanted Ethan, but she was going to be damned if She, the Lady of Dread and the Mistress of Slaughter would allow herself to be defeated in a battle. This machine would be her ticket towards getting rid of Supergirl and dominating Midvale, before she took over the world. Using her X-ray vision, Kara saw everything that Selena was doing but did not want to alarm her friends nor give away her secret. \"What do you see Linda?\" Ethan asked in a hushed tone, noting the fear and concern registering on his girlfriend's face. \"Let's get out of here. Fast.\" she told the group. \"Why? What's wrong? We need to keep an eye on Selena.\" Lucy protested. \"And fight her with what Lucy? You know what she did the last time. Do we look like we can defeat her? Do you see Superman around? I'm with Linda on this one. \" Jimmy answered. \"But where will we go?\" She feared that no place in Midvale was safe from Selena. The witch had after all, burned an old man for asking her to bring the phone lines back up and froze a young woman for demanding her ouster from Midvale openly. \"She hasn't started attacking anybody yet. Let's head to Frostee's. We need to pretend she isn't here until we can figure something out.\" Linda ordered. The last thing she needed was for her friends to be caught once again in the battle that she knew she would have to fight soon. This was certainly not the earth visit she had envisioned. ********** Zor-El and Allura were huddled in conference in their quarters. Their daughter needed help. With Selena back on earth and still seemingly connected somehow to the Omegahedron, it would be next to impossible for Kara to do successful battle with her. It was a relief to both them and the council when, after Selena exited the portal, it closed itself and did not allow any others to pass through. \"Our daughter needs her cousin beside her right now Zor-El. But he does not know her and we have no idea where in the galaxy Kal-El is.\" Allura worried as she continued to watch the screen that allowed them to monitor Kara, now dressed as Linda and working her shift at Frostee's. He continued to tinker with some sort of wand like communicator device beside his wife. He knew that a day like this would eventually come and he had long before been working on the communicator, a request from his brother Jor-El that was never put to use because Kyrpton exploded before he could finish the father and son communicator device. He had modified the equipment to now broadcast from inner space into hyperspace at a frequency that only Kal-El would be able to hear. \"Give me time Allura, I am working on a solution that will be of sure help to Kara. In the meantime, trust in Kara. We have to believe that she will be able to care for herself.\" \"But Zor-el...\" \"I am working as fast as I can!\" he picked up the device and left the room. He headed to the binary chute and recorded a message into the device before hurling it into inner space. \"Kal-El, if you can hear this, I want you to know that you are not alone. There is another Kryptonian on Earth right now. Your cousin Kara. She needs your help. You must go back to Earth immediately and assist her. She is facing the battle of her life Kal-El. I am Zor-El, your uncle and Kara's father. I beg you to help my daughter. The two of you are the last remaining descendants of the House Of El. It is your duty to protect her just as it her duty to protect you. Hurry Kal-El, Kara does not have much time.\" The wand flew through inner space with a blast of light and made its way through outer space with a mission to fulfill. But would it find Kal-El in time? ********** Selena walked through the city without any real direction. The carnival had been destroyed during the battle with Supergirl. She had morphed the carnival into the mountain castle that disappeared instantanously when Supergirl banished her to the Phantom Zone. At that very moment, she had no ally, and no place to stay. She needed a place to think and plan her next moves. The Greasy Wrench Bar was the only other place that seemed to attract her. Maybe because her heightened sense of smell due to exposure to the acrid vapors of the zone led her to smell that Ethan was at the bar as recently as 5 days ago, although he was not to be seen in the bar that day. The person who was there was Jenna, telling the gathered folk about how Ethan had wronged her and left her for a slut. A group of off duty policemen were at the bar and discussing the space craft amongst themselves and other bar patrons. Selena used mind meld methods and her charm to get them to buy her a drink. Interested in gathering more information, she asked about their suspicions regarding who owned the craft. This was when she heard of the sightings of a flying girl and the craft had just magically appeared along with her, as it it was landed in that specific place for a reason. Since Superman was not around, they had no way of telling whether the craft was friend or foe. Just the same, they prepared to battle the alien with Kryptonite. Hoping that the same weakness of Superman would be shared by this alien. Her mind meld with the group was broken before she could charm one of them into giving her the key to the box. A group who had had one drink too many at the bar started a brawl that they had to break up. Causing them to get distracted from their interest in her and breaking the psychic connection. Selena had long heard about the effects of Kryptonite from the Kryptonian criminals who were with her in the zone. She was absolutely sure that this green stone would be the key to finally defeating both the wimp and Supergirl. Using her mind control powers, she got the officers to hand her the box of Kryptonite and a gun. Both of which she hid inside her long sorceress gown. \"Aren't you the fortune teller? What are you doing here?\" Jenna asked Selena who had just sat at the bar, trying to open up the box she had appropriated earlier. \"I have just returned from a very long and nasty trip. Now leave me alone before I turn you into a cat.\" she snarled as she tried different unlocking incantations on the padlock. \"Well, can you tell me my future while you are here? I want to know if I will get my boyfriend 's a free drink in it for you.\" Jenna stated. Selena looked up from the box and accepted the beer. Drinking it slowly and savoring the flavor that was quenching 2 months of parchment for her. \"Now, answer my question.\" Jenna requested. This was way below the witchraft that Selena was now capable of but she was in need of a side kick and she could sense the anger eating away at the soul of this woman. She made the perfect prey for someone like Selena. \"Let us do this in a more private place.\" \"There's an office in the back we use as a rest area. Follow me.\" Jenna lifted the bar countertop to let Selena in. ********** The two men sat at the back of the restaurant and promised to order as many food and drinks as it would take for them to wait for the women to go off duty. Linda and Lucy were an hour late to work and Dean was in no mood to be nice because everyone in Midvale seemed to have disappeared to the park and there were no clients at the restaurant except for Jimmy and Ethan. \"So tell me, what did you do to piss off Lucy that way?\" Jimmy wanted to know as they sat eating their lunch of burritos and chili con carne. \"If I am not mistaken, Linda told her something about what went wrong on our date last night.\" \"That explains why she slept at the Lane's.\" \"No kidding? I spent the whole night looking for her too.\" Ethan explained between mouthfuls of food. Jimmy looked at the girls serving the few clients that were coming in for a late lunch. \"I wish they could have taken the day off.\" ********** \"Your boyfriend, is he the town gardener by any chance?\" Selena asked fishing for information as she cleared a wall in the back office. \"Yes. We've been going together for 2 months. Then that Linda came along and...\" \"Linda? Wait a minute. The wimp is still here?\" Selena felt anger rushing through her blood. So, Ethan and Linda were still together. She would take great pleasure in ending both their lives in the near future. \"Do you know them?\" \"Mi sequere !\" Selena commanded. With a wave of her hand, the images of Jimmy, Lucy, Ethan, and Linda enjoying the girls breaktime at the restuarant appeared on screen. \"That's the bitch! And my man is still with her.\" Jenna declared in an angry voice. 'That bitch is Supergirl. She is also the wimp. Not to worry, they won't be happy for long. Are you willing to do anything to get your man back?\" Selena saw the apprehension appear on Jenna's face. Unsure of what she meant by \"do anything\". She lightly held her index fingers to her temples and muttered \"I will do anything to get Ethan back. Even if it means killing the wimp.\" Jenna's face went blank as Selena took over her person and mind. \"Mihi hoc da!\" Selena pronounced. Effortlessly pulling away the padlock from the box, she loaded the biggest rock into the specially made lead lined gun then placed it in Jenna's hands. \"I will be right there to help you.\" she prodded Jenna out the door. ********** As Selena watched Jenna walk zombie like to the mall, her brain was busy at work plotting a disturbance that would force Kara away from Ethan long enough for Jenna to successfully do what she was programmed to. What would it be? A bank robbery? A fire? Even better, an explosion at the mall parking lot. That should injure enough people and keep Kara busy for a very long time. Rummaging through the odds and ends strewn about the room, she found a model of an F-1 Renault racer strewn among the items. An even more thorough search produced a half used matchbox and an almost burned out candle. \"Perfect!\" Lighting the candle inside the beer mug she had just finished drinking, she held the model car over the flame until it began to melt away. as she dropped the car into the mug, the cars at the mall began to blow up one after another. Sending people scrambling for cover or safety as fires engulfed each floor of the parking building. The fire alarms went crazy inside the mall, forcing an evacuation. Ethan and Linda looked at each other as the sound reached Linda's ears first. \"Get them to safety Ethan.\" \"What about you?\" He pulled her back as she hurried away from the table. \"You know I have to do this.\" She communicated what she really meant with her eyes. Kara needed to help the people. \"Is something wrong?\" Lucy asked as people started running past them. \"Jimmy, grab your camera and let's go.\" Ethan ordered. \"What about Linda?\" Lucy worried for her friend who had rushed out the door before all the panicking started. \"She'll be fine. She said to meet her outside.\" he lied. ********** Flying up the parking building, Kara surveyed the damage and tried to pinpoint what was causing the cars to explode. She sensed that Selena had something to do with this. She just hoped that she was strong enough to end what Selena had started. Flying through the fire and punching through cars soaring through the air, she picked up as many injured as she could and flew them to the open parking lot where people were gathered trying to make sense of the events. \"Look! It's Supergirl!\" a voice in the crowd shouted. Jimmy grabbed his camera and started taking pictures of the rescue. He had finally found his money shots. \"Supergirl! My friend Linda, she's still in there!\" Lucy shouted. Looking back at her friend who obviously had no idea that Linda was hovering above them, she waved and said \"I will take care of her.\" Kara flew through every floor of the building and sucked out the fires with her super breath. She had already put out the fire by the time the fire trucks came. All that was left was to assess the damage. Satisfied that she had done well, she flew back to her friends. Now dressed as Linda again, Lucy hugged her friend with tears pouring down her face. \"Where the hell did you go! If Supergirl had not shown up...\" \"I told Ethan I would meet you all here. I needed to make sure the restaurant was secured first.\" \"You missed Supergirl Linda!\" Jimmy excitedly told her. \"I did?\" she looked at Ethan who winked at her and smiled. ********** \"Supergirl! Show yourself! Face your worst fears! Selena is back!\" the voice of Selena broke through the noise of the firetrucks and police cars arriving at the was no way Linda could break away from the group again. She was hovering above everyone in the afternoon sky, pinpointing Ethan in the crowd and aiming her arms at him in a wandlike manner. \"Come out, come out wherever you are... it won't take much for me to turn your boyfriend into pink mist!\" she thought silently, conveying the same to Kara as she hoisted Ethan up into the air by raising her arms. \"Wha--- No! Put me down!\" Ethan screamed. His body felt bound by unseen ropes as he tried to move his arms or legs. \"Ethan!!!\" Linda cried out trying to stop him from lifting off the ground without flying after him. \"You've got only one chance at this Supergirl. \" Selena warned Kara seriously through thought transference while Ethan continued to lift into the air. Linda felt her heart pounding like it never pounded before. She had to help Ethan. She had to fly up there and get him even if it meant letting Selena win this round. She began to break away from the group. \"Are you crazy! Stay right here. Supergirl will come back. \" Lucy demanded. \"You don't understand Lucy!\" Linda cried out in desperation. \"I do understand. Clark will kill me if anything happens to you! Now stay put!\" \"You won't show yourself? Fine, say goodbye to your loverboy.\" She heard Selena's thoughts. \"No!\" she cried out breaking away from Lucy and running at super speed. Lucy lost sight of her immediately. \"Kara!!!!!\" Ethan hollered as he felt himself dropping out of the sky. He could only hope that she would know where to catch him. \"Trace coordinates for Ethan's landing.\" she screamed into the wrist computer as she tried to beat time and gravity. \"Stop right here.\" The voice commanded her. She held out her arms just in time for Ethan to fall safely within. Her heart pounding in fear and anxiety. Tears began swelling up at the thought that she had almost lost him permanently. \"How did you do that?\" Lucy and Jimmy came running towards them. Setting Ethan on his feet, Linda was ready to tell them the truth. \"There is something the two of you should know about me.\" A shot rang through the air hitting Linda just above the heart. She looked down at it. The bullet should have ricocheted off her but instead, there was a hole in her chest with blood gushing out of it, a green glow pulsing from within her. Kryptonite! She fell to her knees without a word. Her power draining out of her, her surroundings turning dark, she felt her life ebbing away. \"Linda!\" Lucy screamed in horror as she caught the falling body in her arms. \"It came from over there!\" Jimmy hollered. Ethan turned to see Jenna drop the gun and run. \"Why Jenna? What made you do this!\" he screamed. Turning his thoughts to securing Linda instead of chasing after the shooter. \"Ethan.... Ethan.... I am so sorry. I messed up again. I always put you and my friends in danger. I am going to die. Nothing any of you can do will help me. If only Kal-El were here...\" Her voice was barely a whisper in his ear. He wondered why he was able to pick her up without realizing that the Kryptonite in her system had rendered her mortal. He started walking briskly away from the crown. Not really sure of where to turn, what to do, or how to help Kara. Jimmy and Lucy frantically tried to keep up as he ran like a mad man for God knows where. \"Don't worry Linda, I won't let you die! Don't speak. Just rest. We've got to get her to the hospital.\" \"What happened? What's going on?\" Lucy began sobbing as Jimmy supported her weight as they ran. \"Stay with me Linda! You are not going to die on me! \" Ethan kissed her as her body went limp in his arms. ********** In the deep recesses of outer space, a lone flying figure is seen flying hurriedly in the direction of Earth holding the device that Zor-El had cast into nothingness in the hopes of finding him. Kal-El sped forth hoping that he would not arrive too late to help his cousin.[Chapter 8] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs for the excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longing for the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness of their daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her go visit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earth proves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more about the people she had once left behind. The Return Of Kal-El Alura and Zor-El watched helplessly as their daughter was loaded into Jimmy Olsen's car. Alura was inconsolable at the thought that she might have caused her daughter's demise by sending her to Earth. Zor-El however remained strong, trying not to think that his only child and heir would leave this life before they did. \"What have we done Zor-El?\" Alura asked as the car she was watching began to speed away. \"Kal-El is on his way Alura. All is not lost yet.\" he reassured her. The wand had been designed to send a beacon back to Argo city the minute it detected the Kryptonian DNA of Kal-El touching it. The beacon had arrived 10 minutes before Kara was shot. ********** Linda was drifting and out of consciousness in the back seat of the car. Her head rested on Ethan's lap while he lovingly stroked her hair. Lucy was doing her best to control the bleeding as Jimmy struggled to get the car out of the traffic jam that the fire had created. \"Jimmy, we should just run with her.\" Ethan suggested out of exasperation. \"Moving her will make the bullet go deeper into her.\" Lucy warned. \"It's not a bullet Lucy, it's Kryptonite and there is no hospital on this planet that can get that out of her!\" \"Ethan, calm down! We are not the enemy! And what is this about Kryptonite? You are not making any sense. Kryptonite only affects Superman. Keep your wits above you man!\" Linda began coughing and he held her head higher to prevent her from choking on her blood. As the coughing got worse, Lucy rubbed her eyes in disbelief. Was her friend transforming before her very eyes? In her weakened state, Kara could no longer control the human aura of Linda. It took immense concentration and power on her part to keep her alter ego look in place. Now, with the Kryptonite coursing through her system, her natural instinct allowed Kara to surface. The short black hair gave way to long, wavy, blond locks. the Frostee's uniform that was now soaked in blood seemed to be melting off her skin, revealing a blue long sleeved sweater type blouse. Lucy gulped in disbelief when the red skirt and boots appeared on her friend's body. Finally, the S emblem stared her right in the face as it sat in the middle of her friends chest. \"Oh my God!\" she screamed. \"What? What's going on back there?\" Jimmy was trying to see to the back seat through the rearview mirror. \"Jimmy, get to the hospital as fast as you possibly can. Make this car fly you hear me!\" Lucy ordered. \"Is Linda getting worse?\" he asked worriedly as Ethan tried to cover Linda with his leather jacket. \"I don't know about Linda, but Supergirl just showed up.\" Lucy said, still trying to believe the transformation of her friend. \"What????\" Jimmy almost jumped to the back seat to get a good look. He had to content himself with adjusting the rearview mirror instead. \"She wanted to tell you.\" Ethan began to explain. \"You knew all along? And you never told us?\" she asked. \"It was not for me to tell. She was about to tell you...\" \"But your ex gunned her down. That does not matter. Linda or Supergirl, she is still my best friend, and I won't let my best friend die on me. \" \"Her name is Kara.\" \"Kara? So she was the one you were callling....? And I stopped her!\" He thought of whipping out his camera and taking a picture of Supergirl but then decided against it. The world needed more Super people and tearing down Supergirl in the eyes of the world would not do anyone any good. This was a Pulitzer price winning picture he chose to forgo. What everybody needed now was for her to get well and protect Midvale from Selena. Jimmy continued to listen intently to the conversation. So, Superman was not alone after all. He could not wait to see the reaction of Clark and Lois when he told them about this scoop. Traffic finally eased up and he was able to get onto the highway headed for the general hospital. ********** \"Kal-El, Kara has been hurt by Kryptonite, you must hurry. She is dying. Only you know how to cure her. Hurry my son.\" Zor-El telepathically communicated with Superman. \"I am only 1 light year away from earth. How will I find her?\" Superman thought. \"I am activating the tracking beacon on her bracelet. Follow the sound signal. It shall lead you directly to my daughter. Please Kal-El, don't fail us.\" Superman leaned into his flying even more to pick up lightspeed. Familiar with the Kryptonite effect on his own system, he knew that his cousin had only an hour at the most to live. He needed to get to her side immediately. ********** The tracer on the bracelet began emitting blue and red lights accompanied by varying degrees of sound. \"Should we take it off? Lucy asked Ethan. He stared at the bracelet and recalled what Kara had told him before. \"Leave it on. I think it is calling for help. It is a tracer. Somebody will come.\" ********** Selena was now back at the park, waiting for a chance to get closer to the hyper pod and enter it. The crowds only seemed to be getting thicker as the afternoon progressed. She needed to get those people out of there. With Supergirl out of the way, there was nobody to stop her from gaining access to the pod. Finding a secluded spot in the forest, she began to call upon the dark forces to aid her in her quest. \"I am the Queen of Darkness, commander of the evil forces of nature, upon my command, send forth a cyclone storm, let darkness fall upon this place to serve as my shield as I break into the space.\" Picking up a handful of soil, she blew lightly onto it, sending it swirling up into the sky where the dust particles began forming into a formidable weather disturbance. Dark clouds immediately covered all of Midvale, hurricane gusts of winds began to uproot trees and knock people off their feet, flying into the sky. The continuous attacks of bad weather and elimination of the people eventually lifted to reveal Selena, standing before the hyper-pod, no longer cut-off by the police tape. \"I am the living Omega, a fifth of its power to exist on this planet, none shall stand in my way. By the power of the Omegahedron, these doors shall open and this ship shall obey only me !\" The bottom door of the hyper-pod slowly dropped open and closed as Selena walked up its steps. ********** \"Guy's there is absolutely no way the car is moving in this traffic. We will need to make a run for it like Ethan said.\" Jimmy slammed his hands hard on the steering wheel in desperation. They were now caught in highway rush hour traffic that showed no signs of easing up. Kara began to desperately clutch at Ethan. Gasping for breath, she opened her eyes and tried to speak. He hushed her and begged her to just close her eyes and rest. He was getting desperate and wished he could do something for her. But what can a simple man do when his injured girlfriend is not from this planet? \"I just wish Lois were here! She has helped Superman recover from Kryptonite before. She told me the stories.\" Lucy tried to fight her tears. Her friend was dying before her very eyes and all they could do was wish. The flashing lights on Kara's bracelet grew brighter and brighter, the sound was beginning to become deafening. \"Get out of the car. I think help is here.\" Ethan said instinctively recalling how the first bracelet Kara wore reacted the same way each time she was near the Omegahedron. Hurriedly jumping out of the car, Jimmy heard a sonic boom overhead and looked up. The man of steel was flying directly towards them. \"Superman stop! It's Kryptonite!\" Jimmy hollered up into the sky. They saw him suddenly veer off direction and never turn around. Where was he headed? In what seemed like the longest minute to ever exist, they saw him returning, holding a lead box the length of Kara's body. He dropped it a safe distance away from them. They all instinctively knew what he wanted them to do. Jimmy opened up the box while Ethan picked up Kara who was now semi-conscious. Placing her inside the box, he kissed her tenderly for what he hoped, would not be the last time. She opened her eyes, her piercing blue eyes gazing sadly upon him. As she reached out for him, he began tracing her lips in the manner that she had often done to him. She softly kissed his fingers as he passed it over her now bloodied lips. \"Come back to me. I will wait for you.\" he cried as he sealed the box. Superman swooped down almost immediately and took the box. There was only one way to cure Kara. He would have to fly directly into the sun and open the box within. Not even noticing the heat that the core of the sun emitted, he opened the box and took the unconscious young woman out of it. Letting the box drop, he held on to his cousin and watched as the gemstone was ejected from her gaping wound and into the sun's atmosphere. Her wound healed itself and she almost immediately felt her strength return. Within a matter of minutes, Kara was flying on her own alongside Kal-El, on a return path to Earth. ********** The 3 friends remained where they stood, looking up into the now threateningly dark sky. The gusting winds were not strong enough to knock them off their feet yet. \"I just know Kara will survive!\" Lucy hollered over the howling winds. The men continued to watch the sky as Lucy shielded her eyes from the dust particles swirling around. \"Is that what I think it is?\" Ethan tapped Jimmy's shoulder and pointed at a ball that was zooming across the sky. \"Christ! Don't tell me Selena got her hands on the hyper - pod!\" Ethan shouted angrily. \"Look!\" Jimmy pointed towards 2 figures that seemed to be falling from the sky. Superman seemed to just reach down and grab Lucy and Jimmy from the ground. Kara swooped Ethan up as well. How Kara managed to fly while Ethan was showering her face with kisses left Kal-El impressed by his cousin's flying skills. \"Superman, Selena has Kara's hyper-pod !\" Lucy reported. Superman simply nodded at her. \"Kara, follow me.\" Kal-El instructed her. \"Where are we going?\" \"To the Fortress of Solitude. We need to plan how to get your spaceship back.\"[Chapter 9] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs fornthe excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longingnfor the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness ofntheir daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her gonvisit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earthnproves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more aboutnthe people she had once left behind. ThenBattle Begins Thenparty of 5 landed on the surface of the Fortress of Solitude withoutnknowing what their next move would be. Being on an ice slab the sizenof a small city in the middle of the North Pole was not easy on the 3nhuman friends who were now close to hypothermia due to the freezingntemperature. \"Who are these people Kal-El? Why is thatnwoman wearing your clothes? \" The voice of Jor-El echoednthroughout the fortress. \"Father, I present to you Kara,nthe last daughter of the House Of El, daughter of your brother, mynuncle Zor-El. The others are our human friends. We are facing a longnbattle with a sorceress who almost cost Kara her life. Right now,nthis is the safest place for everyone to be right now.\" \"WelcomenKara. You were but a seed in your mother's womb when Kryptonnexploded. It gives me great pleasure to know that my brother and hisnfamily survived the tragedy even as my own family, save for Kal-El,ndid not.\" \"Thank you Uncle Jor. My parents oftennspeak fondly of you as the most brilliant scientist to ever live onnKrypton.\" Kara replied weakly, leaning on Ethan for support. Henfelt like a lead brick was being pressed against him but saidnnothing. \"Kal-El, you must let Kara rest. My scannersnindicate that she is recovering from the effects of Kryptonitenexposure.\" \"Yes, father. Kara, you have to lie down.nYou will be weak for hours.\" \"I am fine cousin. Injust need to get my knees steady and I will be ready to fly again.\"nshe tried to let go of Ethan and stand on her own only to have himncatch her as she began to feel faint. \"H-h-how do you getnsome w-w-w-warmth in this place?\" Lucy asked shivering andnrubbing her arms through what she thought was an already thicknsweater. \"Oh sorry.\" Superman replied walking overnto the crystals table and rearranging a few of the sticks to bringndown the temperature inside. Kara was wobbling as she walkednover the icy floor. Ethan tried to support her every step of the waynbefore remembering that she would probably knock him over and pin himndown if she fell now that her powers were back. He was only able tonlift her when she was wounded because the gemstone rendered hernmortal for as long as it was in her body. \"I'll be finenEthan.\" she assured him as he wrapped his arm around her waistnto keep her steady. \"Not until you can walk a straightnline.\" he steered her towards an ice covered rock slab to sitnwith him. Finishing up at the crystal table, Superman walkednover to where Kara and Ethan were resting in each others arms. Hentowered over both of them and Ethan thought for a split second thatnSuperman was going to slug him for getting too cozy with hisncousin. \"Can I borrow her for a while?\" he askednwith a smile on his face. \"Sure, sure Superman.\"nEthan croaked his answer. He sounded like he swallowed his voice boxnin fear. Holding his hand out to Kara, the two super beingsnflew into the isolation chamber of the fortress in order to have anquiet place to talk. They had a lot of catching up to do. \"Innever thought I would get to meet you. The legendary Kal-El, Son ofnKrypton and Savior of the Earth\" Kara said with awe in hernvoice. \"I never thought I still had family out there.\"nKal-El replied brushing the hair off her face. \"We havenalways known about you. We worship your accomplishments at Argo City.nIn fact, you are my role model and one of the main reasons I havenreturned to earth.\" \"Returned to earth? You havenbeen here before?\" \"Yes. 2 months ago. But you hadnleft for outer space. That was when I met Lucy, Jimmy, andnEthan.\" \"I am familiar with the other 2. You ofncourse know that my alter ego is Clark Kent?\" \"Yes.nBut I do not think Lucy has made the connection yet.\" \"Well,nLois kind of guesses so I would not put anything beyond Lucy. Now,nabout this Ethan...\" \"Are you about to act like anbig brother?\" \"No. It's just that I am responsiblenfor you while you are here.\" She looked at himndisbelievingly. \"I did quite well the first time I was herenwithout you and I did okay this time around until I gotnshot.\" \"Kara, you do not know anything about humansnand yet you allowed yourself to fall in love.\" \"Haven'tnyou? Lucy tells me you have something going on with Lois.\" shendefended herself, standing up from her seat. \"That'sndifferent.\" \"How different?\" \"Itnjust is. Listen, I won't stop you from discovering what thisnrelationship you have with him is about but I want you know that Inwill be here for you if ever you need an older brother to leannon.\" \"Thank you Kal-El. However, I won't be here fornlong. My father only allowed me to stay here 6 earth days. I shouldnleave as soon as we get the hyper - pod back.\" Kal-Elnpulled out the wand from under his cape. \"Your father sent menthis. This is a communicator that will allow us to talk to yournparents in Argo city. We should do this together. Let's go.\" Henled her out of the chamber and back to where the others and thencrystal table were located. With all his might, he stuck the bluenwand into one of the few vacant crystal chambers on the table. Itnbegan to glow a cool, icy blue hue before Zor-El appeared beforentheir very eyes. \"Kara, my daughter, I am relieved to seenthat the help we sent was not too late. Now, listen to me carefully.nYour pod is under the control of Selena. She escaped from the PhantomnZone and our sensors indicate that she is using the pod to make hernway to Argo City. We suspect that she is coming to take thenOmegahedron. You and Kal-El must stop her. There is only one way tondo this. You must force her back into the Phantom Zone.\" \"Father,nI cannot do that, I do not have the prism slab here.\" \"Thenprism will not be a problem. I shall instruct Kal-El on how to buildnone using the crystals in his fortress. In the meantime, if you feelnwell enough, you must go and retrieve your pod. The safety of Argoncity depends on it.\" \"Yes father.\" She lookednat her friends, wondering what to do with them. \"You maynleave your friends in the safety of the fortress. Do not worry, theynare in the safest place on the planet at the moment. Now gonchild!\" Kara turned and was about to fly off when shenremembered something. Landing in front of Ethan, she traced his lipsnand hugged him. \"Be careful. Don't ever scare me likenthat again.\" He begged her. \"Now Kal-El, I need younto collect...\" she heard her father's voice as she flew back tonMidvale. ********** She could not understand why thencomputer was no longer responding to her commands. The only thing shencould think of was that Selena had placed the pod under a spell thatnerased Kara's control over the pod. She would have to fly over thencity for hours at this rate and still not have any idea where Selenanwas. Then, something caught her eye. A severe weatherstorm seemed tonbe cast over a part of the city. Within the thundering roars andnsharp spikes of lighting, she saw the familiar glow of hernpod. Closing her eyes, she tried to make a mental connectionnwith Selena. She was not going to let her get away from Midvale. \"Inwon't let you get to Argo City Selena.\" she thought as she flewndirectly into the storm. \"You cannot stop me Supergirl. Inam in control of the ship. I control everything. Including thenOmegahedron.\" \"You cannot control the Omegahedron.nIt is a force for good and will never be influence by evil.\"nKara tried to slam into the window of the pod but hit a force fieldninstead. \"The Omegahedron is bound to me and my powers. Inmade sure of that when I first got it. How do you think I got out ofnthe Phantom Zone so easily?\" Selena boasted from the throne thatnshe had magically created within the pod. \"Dream onnSelena. That is all you have.\" Kara goaded her. \"Youndare doubt the power of the Mistress of the Dark? Be it light or benit dark, storm warrior, seek her out!\" she chantednloudly. Almost immediately the heavy rain clouds gathered tonform her weather monster. It constantly tried to swat Kara out of thensky but she was too fast for it. It eventually gave up chase and thennresorted to another way of attacking her even as she tried to flynover the pod. Kara's plan called for her to be able tonreconnect with the computer and have it remotely fly the pod to thenclosest and safest area to do battle. So concentrated was Karanon her task that she failed to see the storm monster re-form in frontnof her as she stood on top of the pod roof. With an enormous blast ofnlighting, Kara was struck in the middle of the chest and thrown off.nFalling at top speed to the ground, it took a lot of her energy tonredirect herself to fly into the direction of the monster. However,nshe flew right past and out of the earth's atmosphere. ThinkingnSupergirl was defeated, Selena whooped for joy inside the pod.nCommanding it to fly faster towards Argo City. \"I willnsoon be the mistress of the universe !\" Selena laughednmaniacally. Kara flew back to the burning planet that isncalled the sun. Retrieving 2 firey boulders from its surface, shenflew back to earth hoping that her plan would work. The storm monsternwas still waiting for her when she got back to the flight path of thenpod. Before it could fire off another lightning bolt, shenthrew one boulder after another with all her strength into thendirection of the monster. As the monster absorbed the heat, it begannto lose strength and eventually exploded, scattering a hurricanenstorm upon Midvale. \"No!!!!!\" Selena cried out innanger. She gazed upon the control switches in front of her.nSurely one of these was a weapon of some sort. All the signs were innKryptonian scribe and were useless to her at the moment. Karanlanded as lightly as she could on the roof of the ship and closed herneyes. Willing the ship's computer to listen to her and obey herncommand. \"Computer, listen to me. I am Kara of the Housenof El. Your one true mistress. Why do you disobey me so? The womanninside is an impostor. If you continue on this path you shall causenthe destruction of Argo City. Activate the DNA clearance sequence ifnyou don't believe me.\" She pleaded with the computer. Thendata processing lights inside the ship suddenly lit up with activity.nConfusing Selena who tried to over ride the system by pressing thenvarious lit buttons. \"Identity confirmation required.nPlace your eyes within the scanner. \" A binocular looking piecenof equipment slowly rose in front of Selena. \"I am thenmistress of this ship. Obey only me.\" Selena commanded. \"Doesnnot compute. Please prepare for retinal scan.\" 2 beams of rednand blue spewed from the camera and detected Selena's irises. \"DNAnis non Kryptonian. Unauthorized access. You are not the Mistress Karanof the House of El.\" \"Open access hatch.\" Karanordered the computer that was now back in her command. The Snemblem on top of the ship slowly drew aside to reveal a hole fromnwhich Kara slipped into the ship. \"Leave my ship alonenSelena. Your battle is with me.\" She stood defiantly before hernarch - enemy in a stance that reminded Selena of their first battlenat the mountain castle. The computer, having detected Kara onnboard opened the alternate entry way in preparation for the ejectionnof Selena. \"You can no longer beat me Supergirl. I am nownone with the Omegahedron. I can destroy Argo City and command thenOmegehedron to come to me right now.\" \"Evil willnnever win over the good that lives within the Omegahedron Selena.nThis is a battle you will not win.\" \"ReallynSupergirl? You would rather do battle with me than save those punynentities of Midvale? The city will be washed away in a matter ofnminutes. Millions will die. Do you want that on yournhands?\" ********** Back at the Fortress ofnSolitude, Kal-El and the others study some outlines on an icy wall.nThe plans for building a reinforced Phantom Zone prism. \"Cannwe build this in time?\" Ethan wondered as everyone got busyncollecting the crystal slabs needed.[Chapter 10] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Having tasted life as a human, she longs for the excitement she had as Supergirl while at the same time longing for the company of Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan. Seeing the sadness of their daughter, Alura and Zor - El decide that maybe letting her go visit the planet will help lift her spirits. Kara's return to earth proves to be a learning experience for her as she learns more about the people she had once left behind. Triumphs & Promises The town was overwhelmed by the sudden weather change. Homes were being ripped apart like cardboard by the wind, water from the rains hammered the dam so that it overflowed into the streets and washed away cars, light posts, and had people fighting for their lives as they drowned in the water. Some people were lucky and were able to make it to higher ground before things got worse. But the reality of the situation was that Midvale would be erased from the map if Selena was not stopped soon. Kara knew that the only way to end the horror happening to the humans below her was to stop Selena. She needed to overcome the dark magic that she possessed and place her in the prism. What was taking Kal-El so long? She needed help. For all the super strength within her, the enchantments that Selena could perform prevented her from even getting close to her. She was like a ball bouncing off the walls of the pod as Selena merely needed to wave her hand to prevent her from flying forth. Selena took immense pleasure in seeing her slam into various control panels onboard the pod, usually setting off an explosion and rendering the controls useless. It did not take long for Kara to figure out that the power she was battling was the very power that kept Argo City alive. Selena had said that she controlled the Omegahedron and therefore could command all its powers. There was only one thing to do, prevent the functioning of the Omegahedron from Argo City. But how would she be able to accomplish that? There as absolutely no way she was going to allow the pod to reach Argo City with Selena in it. ********** As if hearing his daughter's thoughts, Zor-El was speedily walking through the halls of the city to the conclave of the Elders and ranking Guardians of the Omegahedron. He would have to demand that they convene as the followers of all that is good in magic in order to bind the powers of the Omegahedron. That was the only way he could help his daughter defeat Selena. The only way that she would be powerless enough to be once again, imprisoned in the Phantom Zone prism. \"By doing what you suggest Zor-El, you realize that we will have directly contributed to the speeding up of Zaltar's prophecy?\" 'It is a prophecy that cannot be prevent from being fulfilled. It all began the day Kara lost the Omegahedron. If we choose to do nothing, Selena will arrive at Argo City and destroy us, taking the sphere with her. Then the prediction will have been for naught.\" he pleaded with them as the wall map outlined the travel path of the hyper pod. \"How can we be sure that the Omegahedron shall still respond to what is good if it has been this heavily influenced by evil?\" Ban-Or, the head of the conclave questioned. \"The sphere has done nothing to harm the city and its inhabitants. Therefore, the evil it possesses does not fully consume it. But the closer Selena gets to us, the more consumed it shall be and I do not doubt that it shall turn on us.\" The group began to get noisy as they openly argued about the recommendation. Time was being wasted as Kara continued to battle a losing fight for the moment. 'Listen to me! Listen to me!\" Zor-El waved his hands about the group in a loud, booming voice. \"My nephew Ka-El, known as Superman on Earth is preparing to help Kara defeat Selena as we argue. With him on our side, we can only succeed. With Kara's help, their success if inevitable.\" A hushed silence fell over the room. If Kal-El was involved, then they had no reason to doubt Zor-El's actions. This was a winning gamble as far as they were concerned. For Kal-El's exploits on Earth was familiar to ever person in their city and they believed he was the savior of the planet Earth and now hopefully, he would be able to help Kara save Argo City as well. \"You have our approval. Shut down the Omegahedron. But, if you fail Zor-El, it will mean our lives.\" he was warned by Gui-Le, the head of the Guardians. \"The House of El shall not fail you.\" he swore as he got up and rushed out of the room. ********** The prism was now standing well balanced in the middle of the fortress. Lucy, Jimmy, and Ethan all could not help but wonder as to how such a thin sheet of glass could manage to imprison anybody. \"There as just some things that human's are not meant to understand.\" Superman explained to them as he prepared to fly to the moon with the slab. Zor-El's instructions were very order to reinforce the slab and insure that Selena would never be able to escape the Phantom Zone, he would need to fly to the darkest side of the moon and coat the crystal slab with the dust granules that darken the earth during a solar eclipse. This would freeze Selena inside the frame and bind her powers permanently. \"Kara and I shall return here once it is safe to take all of you back to Midvale. Don't worry and don't be afraid. This will all be over very soon.\" He assured them. Jimmy and Ethan helped him get the slab loaded onto his back where he held it in place. Taking care not to hit anything within the fortress as he flew out and up towards the moon that was now beginning to glow over the night sky of Midvale. The moon was a very cold, dark and dusty place. Due to the intricate instructions, Superman needed to take extra care and attention in the binding of the sand particles to the prism. Using his heat vision, he melted each sand particle until it was embedded into every space of the crystal prism. The sand seemed to have a voice and thoughts of its own. The pained wails he heard as he scattered the particles manually over the frame were probably enough to make a normal person's ears bleed. The sand particles emitted a banshee like wail as he poured it by hand upon the crystal slab. Coating it evenly until he was satisfied that not a drop would fall off. Fying back to Earth, he tried his best to ignore the deafening shouts the prism was emitting. The noise was deafening even to a super person but he ignored it for the sake of the Earth, Argo City, and his cousin. ********** Retrieving Zaltar's wand and book of Kryptonian history from the storage room of their cabin, Zor-El and Alura set out for the Omegahedron control room. There was a tremendous sense of urgency in their every step. They had seen their daughter trying her best to overcome Selena to no avail while the prism was being prepared. Only if Selena could once again be confronted by her demons would their daughter have a chance of beating the sorceress. They had never told Kara the truth about one almost fatal weakness of Kryptonians, something that could kill them just as well as Kryptonite could. Kryptonians were prone to succumb in failure and death to witchcraft. Only a very strong belief in one's self and the determination to have good triumph over evil would be able to beat such evil. Although it sounded very easy, many a great Kryptonian warriors had died in the process of battling witchcraft, and they were not willing to allow the last remaining children of the House of El to be swallowed by that trap. \"Power down the sphere.\" he ordered the guardian on duty whose job it was to make sure that the sphere was constantly working at optimum level in order to light up the 4 energy panes that powered the city. \"At once.\" the man replied, fiddling with the knobs and switches in front of him. The Omegahedron slowly winded down in speed and its lights began to flicker. \"Leave us.\" he commanded. The man left the pair in the room to do what they needed to do. As Zor-El aimed the wand at the sphere, Alura opened the book to the page pertaining to re-establishing the connection of White Magic to the Omegahedron. \"By the blessed power of our ancestors, we call upon all that is good within the Omega. Now possessed by a demon soul, the destruction of Argo City is its aim. Through this plea we denounce Selena, Sorceress of the Dark. Banish her power from the sphere and restore all that is good within.\" They chanted together. The wand began to shake in Zor-El's hands causing Alura to help him hold it steady. The sphere seemed to be battling the white light that was escaping from the tip of the wand, causing an earthquake within the city. As the people ran to their rooms for protection, the sphere seemed to be growing in size. Black smoke began billowing from within the sphere, trying to beat the white light. Suddenly, a huge white ball zoomed towards the gathering smoke, creating a funnel effect around the smoke, it absorbed the evil being released before crashing into the sphere. Sending Zor-El and Alura crashing into the wall behind them. The sphere had now returned to normal size and had the familiar hum of good that was familiar to all of them. \"It is done.\" A breathless Zor-El told his wife. \"We have helped Kara and Kal-El the best we can. It is all up them now.\" Alura wiped the sweat from her brow. ********** Selena felt something rip inside of her, causing her to fall to the floor in dizziness and pain. Her magic and chants had lost its power and Supergirl was now flying directly for her. Realizing she was no longer bound to the Omegahedron, she reached into her skirt and pulled out her last remaining weapon against the woman of steel. Swiftly standing aside as Supergirl passed her, she grabbed her by the hair and pinned her to the ground as best as she could. Slapping her across the face with unforeseen evil strength, Supergirl opened her mouth. An opportunity that Selena took to force the remaining Kryptonite into her mouth. Covering her mouth, Selena willed Supergirl to swallow the stones. The effects were immediate and yet Supergirl was able to muster the strength to push Selena off her and move away from her. Spitting out the Kryptonite, she crawled across the floor trying to get away from the stone that was sapping her strength once again. \"Father, I cannot do this! It shall be the death of me !\" she cried out in pain. Blood began to spew from her mouth as Kryptonite dust remnants inside her mouth burned her tongue and gums. Zor-El, who had been watching the battle with the elders used the emergency frequency of the pod to communicate with his daughter. \"Kara, believe in yourself. Use what you know to be true as your strength. The purity of life and love will strengthen you.\" his voice echoed throughout the ship. Selena turned around to pick up the Kryptonite. Supergirl was ready for the death blow. Kara lay on her back, visibly weak and seemingly defeated. Breathing hard and unable to swallow due to the effects of the gemstone. \"The purity of life and love will strengthen you.\" she recalled her father's voice. Closing her eyes, she saw images of all those to mattered to her. The images of her mother, father, Kal-El, Lucy, and Jimmy entered her mind. The pictures of the purity of her life. Then suddenly Ethan -- their time together, their kisses, her near death, all images that proved the purity of their love. Holding on to those images for her strength and using sheer willpower and determination, she forced herself to fly towards Selena who was walking towards her, Kryptonite in hand. In a blur, she had dragged Selena out of the ship. Selena dropped the Kryptonite when she realized what had just happened. The chant that would have helped her float in the air seemed to be erased from her mind. Making her realize too late that all her power and magic was not hers, but the Omegahedron's. Whirling around at the sound of the now familiar sonic boom, Supergirl saw her cousin flying towards her, holding the prism in front of him like a shield. Dropping Selena in mid-air, Supergirl flew down after her, grabbing her by the leg, Kara swung Selena around seemingly winding up for a baseball pitch before hurling her towards Kal-El. Selena's scream of agony and defeat filled the skies as she made contact with the specially coated crystal. The sound of the banshee screams immediately froze her between life and death inside the crystal that exploded upon contact. It took a few moments before the weather cleared up totally. Surveying the damage done to the town together, Kara and Kal-El decided to help with the repairs before returning to the fortress to pick up their friends. ********** Having helped Supergirl explain to the police and townsfolk that she was not an enemy and that her ship was not an instrument of evil, the town of Midvale embraced Supergirl, the cousin of Superman and adopted her as a member of their population. After all, what was there not to trust about a woman who was equal with Superman both in strength and love for humankind? Kal-El returned to Metropolis with a promise made to Kara that he would one day visit Argo City and meet their remaining relatives. Now dressed as Linda, Kara worked what would be her last shift at Frostee's. She would be leaving for Argo City that night and she needed to explain herself to her best friend. \"Why the sad look Linda? Why are you emptying out our locker?\" she asked, fearing the answer and already feeling her tears building up. \"Lucy, I need to go home. This was just supposed to be a visit. A learning experience.\" Linda was also fighting off the tears now. \"But why? You have not learned much from us yet.\" she pleaded with Linda. She blocked the locker so that Linda would have to stop what she was doing. \"I know, but I only had 6 days here. I have to go back to my family.\" \"We are your family too Linda. You can stay with us. Mom and dad would love to have you. \" Lucy's voice cracked. \"Yes, you are. You all are Lucy. I will miss all of you. But my family needs me at Argo City. \" Linda broke down in tears. \"Will we ever see you again?\" \"I promise you, I will come back.\" \"And I promise you that your secret will be safe with us.\" Lucy hugged her friend for the last time. ********** Somehow Ethan knew that something was wrong with Linda when she got back from the triumphant battle with Kal-El. From the minute they had returned from the fortress, Linda had a sense of sadness that never lifted. Would she be leaving him again? Could he handle being separated from her again? He found himself back at The Greasy Wrench and being served by Jenna. He needed a drink before he went to see Linda again. Somehow he thought that the beer could ease the impending heartache he was sure she was going to leave him with again. \"Tonight is my last night here.\" she informed him as she served his beer. \"What do you mean?\" \"I need to get over you Ethan. I allowed a witch to possess and use me because of my jealousy. My memories are fuzzy at the moment but I believe that I shot some girl while i was and i both know that I am not that kind of person. So I have decided that in order to get over you, I have to leave everything that reminds me of you behind. I have to find the me that I lost when I fell in love with you.\" \"You did hurt a girl. But don't worry, she won't press charges. Linda understands.\" he explained to her. \"Linda? So she is real after all. All this time I believed I was competing with a ghost, a creation you used to keep me away from you. I understand now. I cannot compete with her.\" He looked at her and smiled sadly. He hoped to become friends with her again. Ethan was the kind of person who did not like to have enemies in life. But he also understood that in order to become a good friend, Jenna had to find herself first. Bidding her farewell and assuring her of their friendship should she choose to return to Midvale in the future, he took his beer and headed to the park. He knew Kara would be waiting for him. ********** The lights of the hyper-pod were all lighted when Ethan arrived. He walked up the steps and saw Linda, now dressed as Kara, sitting at the control panels and making some adjustments. She seemed to be lost in her own thoughts. Sadness was clear on her face. He already knew what she was thinking even before her spoke. \"What's going on? Are you Kara again? Have I lost Linda? Or have I gained Kara? \" he asked her, dreading her answer but already anticipating it. \"The ship controls are completely destroyed. I cannot fix it and I have to...\" her voice cracked as she spoke. Giving away her emotions. \"And you have to go home.\" Ethan crumpled the beer can and threw it against the useless control panel. \"Ethan, please try to understand...\" \"I love you Kara. Stay with me. Please...\" \"I love you too Ethan. But I have my family to think about. My father trusted me to come here and return home at the end. I cannot destroy that trust. Even if I am dying inside because I have to leave you.\" \"I became a mess the first time you left life was almost ruined. You can't just keep coming and going out of it. I don't think I can deal with a second time.\" He hugged her close, willing her to stay with him. \"Ethan, you know I will always be with you.\" \"How do I know that? How do I know you will come back and still love me?\" \"Ethan...\" she tried to speak but his lips were already stopping her. She tried to create a memory of this very moment in time. It would be the one thing of Ethan that she would be able to take back with her. She laid her head on his shoulder as he hugged her tightly after the kiss. Then she saw the glowing bracelet. Taking it off, she took Ethan's wrist and slipped it on. \"You know that I am saving myself for you. Take my bracelet as proof of that. Each time you look at it, believe that I will find my way back to you somehow.I just need you to be patient and believe in everything that our love stands for. \" she said with love filling her voice. Looking at the bracelet, he looked up at her and tried to speak. But she began touching his lips once again. Weakening his anger inside but deepening the sadness that he felt at this bittersweet time. \"My Karalinda.\" he combined her two identities into what was now his nickname for her as he as she lovingly adjusted the bracelet on his wrist. \"I will always be yours Ethan. Believe and trust in it. I will find a way back to you.\" \"And I will wait for you to return Kara.\" he kissed her with as much love and care that he could muster for what he hoped would not be the last time. ********** Kara was flying high above the sky when her now useless hyper pod zoomed past her and into outer space. Looking back, she saw Kal-El catching up with her in flight. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked him in wonderment. \"Going to visit relatives.\" He smiled at her. Now together, the two super beings disappeared into the night sky, each one innocent of the adventures that their futures held for them.

I'll miss you,\" ten-year-old Jessica Sinclair said as she gave her friend Laura Dupree a big hug goodbye. \"I'll miss you, too, Jess,\" replied Laura as she tried the hardest to not cry. Laura and Jessica were best friends and they had been so ever since they were in Kindergarten together. They had also been neighbors up until now because Laura's father had just been transferred to a new position of his job in the state of California which was so far away that Jessica wouldn't see Laura again, at least not for a very long time to come. Laura then reached into her pocket and took out a tiny golden ring in the shape of a crown with a red ruby in the center of it and handed it to Jessica. \"This is for you,\" she said emotionally. \"It's a friendship ring. So you'll always remember me.\" Jessica was now too choked up to speak at all as she simply accepted the ring. \"Well, goodbye,\" said Laura one last time. \"Hopefully we'll see each other again someday.\" And then Jessica watched with anguish as Laura turned around and stepped into the open door of the car her parents were in. Then as the door closed and the car started and began driving away down the street and a moving van followed close behind it. Jessica watched until the car was out of sight. Then she felt as if something had struck her fragile heart and had broken it into a million little pieces. She gave a heavy anguished wail as she rushed into her house with tears streaming down her face. She ran all the way up the stairs and then ran into her bedroom, slamming the door closed behind her. She leaped onto her bed and clutched at her pillow as she buried her face into and began sobbing her heart out like she never had before. It was just so unfair! Why did Laura have to leave so suddenly like this? After all they had talked about staying together forever, going to college together and being maids of honor at each others' weddings and having their children be best friends with each other. They had always thought if ever they moved to another place it would be together. And now it seemed all of their dreams of those things were completely shattered. She remained sobbing for a long time. She was almost asleep from the exhaustion of it when suddenly she heard her mother call to her from downstairs. \"Jessica, are you awake! Max is here to see you!\" She got off her bed very slowly and wiped away the remaining tear stains from around her eyes which actually hurt a bit now. She went downstairs where she found Max, who was a boy who she went to school with and who also lived in the neighborhood. He stood at the bottom of the stairs. \"Hi, Jessica,\" he said very softly as he looked at her face. \"Hi, Max,\" she replied dryly. \"I wanted to tell you I'm sorry about Laura leaving,\" Max continued. \"I knew how you two were best friends and... well... I just feel like I know how it feels to leave someone you love behind.\" \"Really?\" asked Jessica with a sniffle. \"Max, you sure have changed since last year. Before then you were such a...\" \"I was a brat, yes I know,\" admitted Max. \"Actually I was gonna say a wild thing,\" said Jessica. \"What happened to you? You're so different now. So caring.\" \"Well...\" Max paused for a few moments. \"I don't know if you'll believe me,\" he continued. \"Last year I ran away from home and I found a sailboat by the ocean and I sailed in it to this big island and there was these big, hairy, and wild things living on it. They made me their King and I promised them to make things better for them but I only made things worse and so I had to leave. I learned about being caring and understanding of others while I was there.\" Jessica listened to his story with wide eyes. Now she was silent as she didn't know whether or not she should believe it. Though she couldn't deny he had changed since last year and also that he looked and sounded quite sincere in his telling of how. \"I wish I could go there,\" she said at last. \"Well, maybe you can,\" said Max. \"I did leave the sailboat by the ocean when I came home.\" \"I don't know if I'd want to leave my family though,\" she said. \"They're all I've got.\" \"I realized that too when I was with the Wild Things,\" said Max. \"Though they did become like a second family to me.\" Max went home shortly after. Then a few hours later that evening, Jessica was in her bedroom and trying to get her history and arithmetic homework done, which were actually her two worst subjects, when suddenly she heard her mother coming up the stairs with heavy footsteps. She then threw the door open and entered. Her face wore a not too pleased expression. \"Jessica Sinclair,\" she began heatedly. \"I have just received a call from you teacher. She says your grades are so poor you may have to repeat the fifth grade next year if they don't start improving before next semester. And until then you are grounded.\" \"What!? But Mom!\" Jessica began in horror. \"Get back to your homework!\" her mother said and with that she slammed the door closed behind her. Jessica was furious now. Why was her life so unfair now! First her best friend leaves, and now she was grounded and also facing the possibility of repeating the fifth grade next year which not only meant that she wouldn't be in the same class as any of friends were but also that she would still have the horrible Mrs. Burcus as a teacher again. She was so upset that she ripped up the pages of homework sh e had started on and then stomped on top of them. She then opened her door and rushed downstairs. She opened the front door and ran out of it. She then kept on running and running. She was soon leaving the neighborhood behind and heading into the forest that surrounded it. She ran through breathing heavily with her heart racing a mile a minute as she darted around trees and bushes and leaves and sticks crunched under her feet. She finally reached the edge of the forest at which she met with the ocean and she stopped there. She noticed the tiny sailboat sitting beside the edge of the water. She knew at once it was the same one Max had used to go to the island where the Wild Things were and back. A thought suddenly occurred to her. Maybe if such an island really existed maybe she could to it and maybe she could also find a happier life there away from here. She stepped carefully into the sailboat which was only just big enough for her to sit in, hoisted the sail, and shoved it out into the sea. She sailed onward for a whole night and most of the following day with no trace of land in sight. Then as she woke up the next day after a long and weary sleep she looked out ahead and saw the edges of the cliffs on an island far in the distance. As she got closer she thought she also saw something big and hairy standing on top of the lower cliffs. She then heard it give a loud hooting sound and then run away. When she at last reached the edge of the ocean she parked the sailboat on the sandy beach and then stepped out of it and started to walk around the cliffs. As she did she suddenly heard a loud raucous of voices coming from ahead of her. She looked in their direction and saw a band of huge and hairy things running toward her. She stopped in her tracks and waited for them to come. \"He's back! He's back!\" the big heavy one in front of them was exclaiming. \"I told you he'd come back! I told you! I knew it! I just...\" he stopped abruptly as he stopped just a few feet in front of Jessica and the others all stopped behind him. Jessica now had a good view of them. She saw the one in front of them looked rather like a tigon with horns. There was one that looked like a bluish gray bull, one that looked like a sad eyed troll, one that looked like a giant goat walking upright, and also there was one that looked like a giant bird walking upright. There was also one that had long red hair and rhinoceros horn on its nose, and one with long brown hair who was rather pretty looking. Finally the big tigon looking one spoke in a deeply sad and disappointed voice. \"Aw darn it, it's not him after all!\" \"I told you so!\" said the rhino horned one in a high feminine voice. \"Well, what is it then?\" asked the one who looked like a goat. \"I don't know,\" said the troll like one. \"I've never seen anything like it before.\" Jessica realized these must be the Wild Things that Max had told her about. She smiled as she stepped forward and introduced herself to them. \"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Jessica Sinclair. I'm sorry I wasn't who you thought I was. Were you hoping I was Max, by any chance?\" \"Max! Yes, I was hoping he had come back to us!\" said the giant tigon. \"Did you know him?\" \"Yes, I do know him,\" said Jessica. \"He was once our King,\" said the tigon. \"What about you? Are you a King, too?\" \"No,\" said Jessica, \"because I am girl, and I am a Queen.\" \"A Queen?\" repeated the tigon. \"What's a Queen?\" \"A Queen is like a King,\" said Jessica, \"only it's a female's, a girl's position. She rules over everyone around her and helps them and makes life good for them.\" \"Really?\" said the tigon. \"We could really use something like that around here. And if you knew Max you must be a good Queen for us to have here. Would you do us the honor of staying with us and being our Queen?\" \"I would be delighted,\" said Jessica with a big grin. \"Then come with us and we'll lead you to your throne,\" said the tigon. \"My name is Carol, by the way,\" he added and introduced the others in turn, \"and this is Douglas, this is Alexander, this is Ira, this is Judith, and this is KW.\" When they were further onto the island they came to what looked like a huge fortress made entirely of sticks. \"Wow! Did you make this?\" asked Jessica in amazement. \"Yes, we did, with the help of King Max,\" replied Carol. Carol then went into the fortress for a moment and then returned carrying a golden crown and a scepter. He then placed the scepter carefully in Jessica's hand and the crown on top of her head and it fit her just as if it had been made especially for her. Life here is gonna be good, she thought[Chapter 2] \"So, as Queen, what is your first order of business?\" Carol asked Jessica. Jessica thought about this. There were actually so many things she wanted to do with these big, hairy, and sweet creatures. Finally she said the first thing that came into her mind. \"Let us all play a game!\" \"What kind of a game?\" asked Ira. \"How about Tag?\" Jessica suggested. \"What is Tag?\" asked Judith. \"It is a game in which you have to touch someone to make them chase after you,\" Jessica explained. \"And then you run away from them as much as you can and then if they get to touch you that means that you're it now and you have to chase after them while they run away from you.\" \"Well, that sounds like fun,\" said Judith. \"Is it dangerous in any way?\" asked Alexander. \"No,\" said Jessica, \"just as long as you watch where you're going and you don't tag anyone to roughly.\" \"Okay then, let's play!\" exclaimed Carol. Then Carol tagged Douglas. \"You're it!\" he said. Carol then ran away from Douglas as Douglas began chasing after him. Then Alexander tagged Ira. Then KW tagged Judith who tagged Jessica. Then in a few seconds they were all running after each other and away from each other at the same time. They all laughed as they ran around and dodged trees and rocks and shrubs. At one point Alexander rammed into a tree with his horns. \"Ow! I hate when this happens!\" he exclaimed as he pulled his horns free and left marks against the bark of the tree. He was just about to start running again when Ira caught up to him and tagged him on his shoulder so that then he was running in the opposite direction after him. \"Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! You can't catch me!\" Judith laughed as she ran in leaps and bounds away from everybody. Then all of a sudden Douglas jumped out from behind a tree and tagged her squarely on her rhino horn. \"Hey, no fair!\" she exclaimed as she furiously chased after him now. Jessica was running after Carol at full speed. She couldn't remember having this much fun in so long. Finally she caught up with him just enough to tag him. She then quickly turned around as he began chasing after her with a huge grin on his face. They ran and ran all around the forest for an hour or two and then they all ended up running in the same direction at the same time and then ended up colliding into each other in a huge heap of laughter. \"TAG!\" they all exclaimed together at the same time. Then they all sat down and rested for a while to catch their breaths. Then Carol said, \"Whew! That was fun! The most I've had in a very long time!\" \"Who knew that running away and chasing after someone could be so thrilling!\" exclaimed KW as she rested her head back against Carol's shoulder. \"So what do we do now?\" asked Douglas to Jessica. Jessica thought about this for a while and then said, \"I know! We can play hide and seek!\" \"What is that?\" asked Alexander. \"It's a game in which one of us closes our eyes and counts to about twenty while the rest of us all hide somewhere and then the one who is left finds us,\" she explained. \"That sounds like my kind of game,\" said Ira. \"Mine too,\" said KW. \"So who wants to count while the rest of us hide?\" asked Jessica. \"ME! I DO!\" exclaimed all of the Wild Things at the same time. Jessica chuckled and said, \"Alright, I guess I'll be the one to count so you all better run off and find yourselves some good hiding places.\" And they did. Jessica closed her eyes and began to count to twenty. She could hear sounds of shuffling and scuffing coming from places around her. When she at last reached twenty she called out, \"Ready or not, here I come!\" She opened her eyes and could see not anyone in sight. She began running around the forest looking for everyone. The first one she found was Douglas as he was hiding behind a tree that was big and thick but didn't conceal him completely. Then they found Ira hiding in between two large bushes. Next they found Alexander hiding behind a large boulder. They then found Judith hiding in a small part of the Fortress. Next they found KW as she was hiding underneath a pile of sticks. Then after much hard searching they finally found Carol. He was standing underneath a cliff by the edge of a lake. \"You had the best hiding place of all, Carol,\" Jessica said congratulating him. \"That was kind of boring though, the waiting part,\" said Carol. \"Well, the next time you can be the one to count to twenty for us,\" said Jessica. \"Well,\" said KW, \"It's getting kind of late so we should be getting to sleep about now.\" They all agreed. \"Where do you usually sleep?\" asked Jessica. \"Usually just on the ground,\" said Carol. \"Though we used to these houses but they sort of... fell down.\" \"Well,\" said Jessica. \"Why don't we all sleep close together to keep warm. And then tomorrow we'll build new houses for all of you.\" They were very pleased with this suggestion. And then they all huddled together on the ground in a big pile with Jessica in between them and they all fell fast asleep. The next day they set about building new houses for each other. They gathered up all the sticks they could find and began wheedling them together. It was taking a long time but Jessica told them that if they just put their hearts into it and their minds to it they could accomplish this. And so that's what they did. When the first couple houses were nearly completed KW, who was working alongside of Jessica, said to her, \"You are the best Queen we have ever had, even if you're the only Queen we've ever had.\" She gave a lighthearted laugh. \"You have a very nice laugh,\" said Jessica. \"Really? That is what Carol says too,\" said KW blushing a bit. Then she asked, \"Were the Queen where you came from?\" Jessica hesitated for a moment and then replied, \"No... at least not for very long. You see, I was exiled from my land.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked KW confused. \"I mean,\" said Jessica, \"I was banished to live on my own outside of my homeland where I was born and raised.\" \"But why?\" asked KW gently. \"Because... I can't do arithmetic,\" Jessica said weakly. \"What is that?\" asked KW. \"It's sort of like counting,\" said Jessica. \"Only it's much more complicated and complex and makes your head hurt when you try to do it right.\" \"Well, if it makes your head hurt then you shouldn't do it,\" said KW. \"Good point,\" said Jessica. \"But where I came from nobody seemed to realize that.\" \"And so you left?\" said KW. \"Yes,\" said Jessica sadly. \"No one wanted me there anymore. Everyone who did had already left.\" \"Who were they?\" asked KW. \"They were my best friend Laura,\" said Jessica weakly feeling a lump rising in her throat. \"She was taken away actually though.\" \"By who?\" asked KW. \"By her parents,\" said Jessica. \"What are parents?\" asked KW. \"Those are really mean and annoying big people who like to make your life miserable for you even when it already is and take away all of the fun in it,\" said Jessica bitterly. \"Oh,\" said KW. \"Well, you don't have them anymore now. You have us. And we'll be your family for you if you like.\" \"I would like that,\" said Jessica. \"I really would.\"[Chapter 3] \"So where are we going?\" Jessica asked KW. KW had been leading Jessica through the forest and out of it and into a great vast dessert. She had said she wanted to show her something. \"We're going to go see Bob and Terri,\" replied KW. \"Who are they?\" asked Jessica curiously. \"You'll see soon enough,\" replied KW. \"Well, are they big and hairy and wild?\" asked Jessica. \"No, not at all,\" KW replied with a laugh. Just then she stopped and reached down to pick up two small stones. Jessica looked up and saw two large snowy white owls flying just overhead of them. Then the next moment she was shocked when KW hurled one of the stones toward one of them which struck it under its left wing and it feel into the sand with a soft thump. KW then did the same with the other owl. Jessica watched as KW went over to the fallen owls and picked them up one after the other and held them under her arms. She went back over to her and said cheerfully, \"My Queen, I'd like you to meet Bob and Terri,\" she nodded toward each owl on either arm. \"They're my two dear friends on this part of the island.\" Jessica looked at the two owls and thought they were the cutest owls she had ever seen. \"Hi,\" she said smiling. Bob and Terri then made squeaking noises which she couldn't understand. KW said, \"They're glad to meet you.\" How can she understand what they're saying when I can't? Jessica wondered to herself. She then remembered something her grandmother had told her before she had died a few years ago. 'Listen with your heart to understand someone who is strange or different from you', she'd said. And so she decided to give it a try. She then asked the two owls, \"Did you mind when you got knocked out of the sky? Did it hurt any?\" The two owls began squeaking to her again. She concentrated with all her might to listen to them rightly. Then she started to make out words from the squeaks and then at last she understood them completely. \"They said they didn't mind at all because I'm the one who did it,\" KW said. \"I know,\" said Jessica. \"You mean you can understand them?\" asked KW in surprise and delight. \"Yes, I can,\" Jessica said. \"I just listened to them with my heart.\" \"Oh, I'm so glad!\" exclaimed KW ecstatically. \"I just wish Carol would too.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Jessica. \"I mean, Carol can't understand them. He's actually the only one who can't understand them around here. And I just don't know why not,\" replied KW sadly. \"Well, why don't we bring them back with us and I can teach Carol to listen with his heart,\" Jessica suggested. \"Um... I don't think that would be a good idea,\" said KW hesitantly. \"Why not?\" asked Jessica. \"Because Carol doesn't seem to like Bob and Terri,\" KW admitted unhappily. \"And I can't understand why, and I probably never will.\" \"Carol doesn't like Bob and Terri and you don't know why? They never did anything to him, did they?\" asked Jessica in confusion. \"No, never, ever,\" said KW. \"In fact they only met him for a moment last year when I brought them for him to meet.\" Bob and Terri then hooted sadly, saying they wished Carol could come to like them. \"Well,\" said Jessica thoughtfully. \"Here's what I think we should do. We should go back by ourselves and I'll talk to Carol about Bob and Terri and see if I can get through to him about this.\" \"Okay,\" said KW. \"Though I must warn you, he is not an easy guy to reason with, or sometimes to even talk to.\" \"Well, what makes you say that?\" asked Jessica. \"Well, because whenever we argue over anything at all he starts yelling at me and sometimes threatens me and once he even said he wished I would go away and leave the island,\" said KW miserably. \"But does he like you, do you think?\" asked Jessica. \"Yes, I think he still likes me,\" she said. \"At least he says he does. But I'm not always so sure of it,\" she added. \"Well, I'll have a word with him and see if anything comes of it,\" Jessica promised. \"Thank you,\" said KW. 'Maybe since you're our first Queen you can get through to him where I haven't or has anyone else.\" She then opened up her arms and let Bob and Terri go and they flew away into the sky again. Then they headed back through the dessert and into the woods again. They soon found Carol sitting just outside of his hut. He looked up when he saw them approaching and asked, \"Hey, where have you two been?\" \"Jessica wants to talk privately with you,\" KW said coolly. \"Now, if you'll excuse me.\" Then as KW turned around Jessica came up to Carol and sat down beside him and said, \"KW just took me to see Bob and Terri.\" \"Oh. Did she?\" asked Carol sounded quite downhearted. Jessica nodded. \"And I just adored them. They're so nice and sweet.\" \"Are they?\" asked Carol in a cold voice. Jessica nodded again. \"They are, but KW says you don't seem to like them or even understand what they're saying and she doesn't know why not. So I wanted to ask you why.\" \"I don't know why I can't understand them,\" Carol admitted. \"And I don't like them because... I just don't!\" \"Come on, you have to have a reason for not liking someone,\" Jessica insisted. \"Did they ever do anything to you?\" \"Well... yes, they did!\" said Carol. \"What did they do?\" asked Jessica. \"They tried to steal KW away from me!\" Carol said bitterly. \"What do you mean they tried to take her away from you?\" asked Jessica in confusion. \"I mean one day she went off on her own and she met them and stayed away a long time. And then she kept on going away for long periods of time. They started getting longer and longer, and then finally one day I told her never to go see them again and to stay with me. And then she went away and said she wouldn't come back, and then I kind of went out of control and I... destroyed our houses. But she came back anyway and then she brought Bob and Terri here to live in the fortress we'd made for King Max and I told her they weren't welcome here and then she went away and swore she would never come back. Then since last year I haven't been seeing very much of her. In fact since you came is the longest she has been on this side of the island.\" \"I see,\" said Jessica beginning to make sense of everything. \"But why don't you want KW to be friends with Bob and Terri? I mean, they're just a couple of cute white owls.\" \"That's just it!\" said Carol rather loudly. \"Because they're different! They're not like us at all! All they eat is worms! I find that disgusting! And KW seems to be able to understand them better than she has ever been able to understand me! But I can't ever understand them and their stupid squeaking! I could just eat them up! One of these days I'll... OW!\" Jessica had slapped Carol on his nose as hard as her hand would. \"Hey! You hit my nose and now it hurts!\" he said sounding both very hurt and angry at the same time. \"I had to!\" Jessica yelled. \"It was for your own good! You can't hate Bob and Terri just because they're different from the rest of you! And don't you dare even think about eating them! That would just hurt KW more and keep away from you forever and ever!\" Carol stopped rubbing his nose and said slowly, \"You're right. I didn't think of that.\" Jessica calmed down and spoke softly now. \"Bob and Terri like you and they want you to like them, just as KW does. And KW says you told her you liked her but she isn't sure of it now. So I'm asking, do you like her?\" \"Yes, I do!\" said Carol. \"I like her a lot. In fact I like her more than I've ever liked anyone or anything before. I... I love her!\" Jessica smiled. \"And what is it that makes you love her?\" \"Well, it's how nice and sweet and gentle and caring she is all the time. And how she seems to understand so much about all of us, including me, most of the time anyway.\" \"Well, I really think you should tell her all of that,\" said Jessica. \"Why don't you?\" \"Because... I'm worried she won't believe me. That she'll laugh in my face and go away again,\" Carol admitted miserably. \"But I'm sure she wouldn't,\" Jessica assured him. \"She wouldn't if she is all that you say she is, I'm sure. And as for Bob and Terri, instead of being so selfish toward them you should open up your heart to them and try listening to them with your heart to understand what they're saying. That's what I did and I understood them well.\" \"Gee, I never thought of it like that, either,\" Carol said in surprise. \"It just might work.\" \"And,\" Jessica continued, \"in fact, I think you and KW go very well together. That is she completes you and fills in the empty parts of your heart. And so you two should get married to each other.\" \"What does it mean to get married?\" asked Carol. \"You don't know? It means you stay together forever and always love each other no matter what happens or whatever comes between you, and I think that is just what you and KW both really want but you're both just afraid you can't have it. Well, now you can, because I am your Queen around here and I can arrange for you two get married as soon as possible.\" Carol's eyes lit up and he started smiling. \"Could you really? That would make everything better again. You truly are our Queen that we've been waiting for!\"[Chapter 4] Jessica and Carol then went to find KW. When they found her Carol approached her and said, \"KW, Jessica just gave a good talking to and she also knocked some sense into me,\" here he rubbed his nose slightly, \"I'm sorry for all the times I got mad at you and at Bob and Terri. I just could never understand them or why you liked to be around them a lot instead of with us. Jessica said I could understand them if I just tried listening to them with my heart. She also said that you and I should get married if we really love each other, and you do still love me, don't you?\" \"Yes, I do,\" KW said. \"And I want us to be together. But I also love Bob and Terri, just in a different way. I love them because they are my friends in a different way than the rest of you, they understand everything about me and always want to listen when I have problems. In fact, the last time I left here to be with them they told me the best thing to do would be to go back to you and forgive you.\" \"They did? Really?\" Carol asked much surprised at this. \"Yes, they did,\" replied KW. \"And I decided they were right. I just didn't know how to stay together with you.\" \"Well, I know how you can,\" said Jessica brightly. \"You just have to get married.\" \"What does getting married mean?\" asked KW curiously. \"It is when you two stand together in front of all your friends and you recite the vows of love and togetherness to each other, and then someone who is in power, such as a Queen like me, pronounces you to be husband and wife and then you stay together for always even when you're apart form each other because you have your hearts connected with each other.\" \"I really like that,\" said Carol. \"That is just what I've always wanted with KW.\" \"So have I have with Carol,\" said KW. \"And since we'll be inviting all of our friends to our wedding can we please invite Bob and Terri to it also since they are my friends too?\" Then for just a brief moment Carol had a rather uneasy look in his big eyes, but then he glanced at Jessica who nodded approval, and then he said to KW, \"Of course we can. In fact, why don't we go and invite them right now?\" \"What a good idea,\" said KW smiling. \"It is about time you got to know them properly anyway.\" So then they went through the woods and headed out toward the dessert once again. Along the way Carol, asked, \"So what else happens at a wedding?\" Jessica had been to a wedding once before for her cousin's and so she knew very well about them. 'Well,\" she began, \"the groom, that is you Carol, gives the bride, and that's you KW, a ring and she gives him one to symbolize their unity of togetherness. They also choose which of their friends will be the best man and the maid of honor for each of them. The bride also has a bouquet of her favorite flowers. And there is also a wedding feast of their favorite foods. And then there is dancing and sometimes singing.\" \"Well, I suppose Judith should be my Maid of Honor,\" said KW. \"After all, she is the only other female around here. She also has a pretty good singing voice, too.\" \"And I think I would like for Douglas to be my Best Man,\" added Carol. \"As he and Judith always seem to go well together. In fact, I think they should probably get married someday too.\" \"Well,\" said Jessica with a smile, \"after the wedding, the bride throws the bouquet at the guests and the one to catch is the next one in line to get married after them.\" \"Then we better hope Judith or Douglas catch it,\" said Carol very seriously. \"As for the wedding feast, what do you usually have at it?\" asked KW a bit uneasily, \"You seem I am a vegetarian and the only one who is among us. I just won't eat anything of meat I think it is wrong. And so I just eat plants and fruits there are on the island.\" Jessica smiled reassuringly. \"Then I think that is exactly what the wedding feast should be made of. Since you are the bride, KW, everyone ought to respect your wishes for your wedding.\" KW looked much relieved at this. Then she said, \"And as for the bouquet, we do have lots of kinds of flowers on the island around here and there. Although we have to be careful when we find and choose them as Carol is allergic to some kinds, and so am I.\" \"Okay,\" said Jessica. \"And as for the dancing I can teach you all you need to know about it.\" It was then that they finally had reached the dessert area of the island. They then began to look for Bob and Terri. KW soon found them and picked up to stones and threw them at each of them one after the other. Then they fell from the sky and she rushed up to them and picked them up and brought them over to Carol. \"Bob, Terri,\" said KW, \"this is Carol. Carol would you like to say anything to them?\" Carol stared at the two snowy white owls for a long moment before he finally muttered, \"Yes, I want to say I'm sorry for mistreating you two.\" The two owls then began squeaking at him. Carol looked confused for a moment and then Jessica whispered to him, \"Remember, try to listen with your heart.\" And so he closed his eyes and concentrated. It took him a long time, but then finally he opened his eyes and smiled as he said, \"They said they forgive me!\" \"I know,\" replied Jessica. \"You guys really are nice,\" Carol said to Bob and Terri. \"But then I guess I should have known you were all along if you were always friends with KW. I should have realized that all along and just tried to understand you guys instead of being such a big selfish brute!\" Jessica and KW nodded their agreement. Then KW said to the two owls, \"Now me and Carol are going to get married and we want you to come to our wedding. You will come, won't you?\" Bob and Terri then both squeaked and hooted their happy agreements. \"Wonderful!\" said KW. \"You can come back with us now and help us make the wedding preparations.\" So then they all headed back out of the dessert the way they had come. Carol looked around at the vast and seemingly endless sand surrounding them and said, \"It just seems like this dessert gets bigger and bigger every time I see it.\" \"And you know it is only going to keep getting bigger,\" KW told him gently. \"Because nothing lasts forever.\" Carol then looked up toward the sky with the sun at its highest peak on it. Then he turned to Jessica and asked, \"King Max said the sun is going to die someday. Is that really true?\" Jessica glanced at the sun briefly and then replied, \"Well, yes. But not for a long, long time. And I'm sure none of us will be around when it does. And,\" she added, \"Some things are forever, like love.\" \"Don't I know it,\" said Carol as he looked adoring at KW, his soon to be bride. Just then Jessica heard something shuffling along in the sand on a hill above them. She looked up and saw to her surprise a giant sized hairy gray and white dog-like creature roaming in the dessert. \"What is that up there?\" she asked pointing to it. \"That is the big dog,\" replied Carol absently. \"Just leave it alone.\" \"Why don't we invite him to our wedding too?\" suggested KW. \"Well... uh?\" Carol began. \"I think that is a great idea!\" said Jessica. She then ran up the sandy hills toward the dog in spite of Carol's protests of it. \"Hey!\" she exclaimed as soon as she was beside its big floppy ears. \"How are you?\" The dog looked quite startled as it turned around to look at her. It then stuck its long wet tongue out and panted and wagged its tail at her as its huge blue eyes sparkled with delight. \"Would you like to come to the wedding for Carol and KW?\" asked Jessica. The dog then at once bent its head down and licked her face. Jessica giggled and said, \"You would? Great! You're a good boy, yes you are!\" she said as she stroked and petted the big dog's long, thick, wavy fur. \"Oh boy!\" sighed Carol in exasperation.[Chapter 5] Jessica went with Carol and KW along with Bob and Terri with the big dog following behind them back to the main part of the island. Once they were all in the forest clearing once again Carol put two fingers to his mouth and blew a very loud whistle. Then all at once all the other wild things came running up to them. \"What is it, Carol?\" asked Judith a bit impatiently. \"We know you only do that when there is something very important we should know.\" \"There sure is now,\" Carol said smiling. \"We have an important announcement to make. Tell them KW?\" \"Carol and I are going to get married,\" KW announced happily. \"What does that mean?\" asked Alexander curiously. \"It means, according to Queen Jessica, that we'll stay together forever and ever in our hearts,' answered KW. \"Well, that is certainly good news to hear,\" said Daniel. \"It's about time you two stayed together instead of chasing each other away all of the time.\" \"That is just what Queen Jessica said, and I realized it was true,\" said Carol humbly and KW nodded her agreement. \"And there is more good news to it. You are all invited to our wedding and so are Bob and Terri as they are now officially my very good friends, and so is the big dog you see behind us.\" Everyone cheered and applauded and shouted \"Hurray!\" at this. Then Douglas asked, \"What exactly is a wedding?\" \"It is a special ceremony at which Carol and KW will become husband and wife by the power invested in me as your Queen,\" Jessica explained to them. \"And Judith,\" KW said as she turned toward her, \"I would like for you to be my Maid of Honor.\" \"Really? Why, I'd be so honored,\" said Judith sounding flattered. \"And also because you have such a lovely voice you can sing at the wedding for us,\" KW added. \"Really? I can? Oh gosh, thanks!\" Judith said overjoyed. \"And you, Douglas,\" Carol added turning toward Douglas, \"will be my Best Man.\" \"Me? Your Best Man? Aw, gee, Carol! I'm so touched,\" said Douglas a bit emotionally. \"Okay. So now we should probably all start getting ready for the wedding,\" said Jessica. \"First of all, Carol, it is usually customary where I come from for the groom to be separated from the bride for a little while before the wedding begins and to just be with other men while the bride is just with other girls. So I'll go with KW and Judith to make preparations for the wedding while you go with Douglas and the others. We'll get the flowers for the bouquet while you guys get the food for the feast. And there's no need to worry,\" she added, \"We'll take good care of her.\" And so Carol went with Douglas, Daniel, Alexander, and Ira to another part of the island to the left while KW went with Judith and Jessica to another part to the right. \"So,\" Jessica said, \"I suppose first we should start looking for the right flowers for K W's wedding bouquet. How about roses?\" \"Oh no!\" said KW quickly. \"Carol is just insanely allergic to them.\" \"Oh. Okay. Well, how about tulips?\" suggested Jessica. \"Oh no!\" said KW. \"Those are the ones that I am allergic to.\" \"Alright,\" said Jessica. \"How about magnolias?\" \"Those will do,\" said KW. \"Except for one thing,\" said Judith. \"What's that?\" asked Jessica. \"Those are the ones that I am allergic to,\" Judith replied. \"Then how about marigolds?\" suggested Jessica. \"Those could do,\" said KW thoughtfully. \"Except,\" she added, \"we don't have any of those on the island.\" \"Well,\" said Jessica, \"can you tell me what kind of flowers you do have on the island that none of you are allergic to?\" KW and Judith thought about this for a while and then they both replied in unison, \"Violets.\" \"Okay,\" said Jessica. \"Those should do just fine. Where can we get some?\" \"There is a whole patch of them not too far from here,\" said KW. \"It's very pretty.\" KW then led the way to the patch of violets and, sure enough, when they reached it they found a huge lot of purple and blue violets growing in a clear area of nothing but green grass and a few sparse trees. \"This place really is beautiful,\" said Jessica. \"It's the most beautiful place I've seen on the island yet,\" KW said. \"I have an idea,\" said Jessica. \"Why don't we have the wedding right here? It's looks so perfect for it.\" \"I love that idea!\" said KW happily The three of them then set about picking a huge lot of violets and putting them together for K W's bouquet. As they were doing so, KW asked Jessica, \"Is there any more about weddings we should that you can tell us?\" Jessica thought about it for a moment and then answered, \"Yes, after I pronounce you husband and wife you must have your first kiss.\" \"What is a kiss?\" asked KW. \"It is when two people put their lips together and they rub against each other for a long time, and sometimes they put their tongues into each others' mouths when they do it,\" said Jessica. \"Eww, that's disgusting!\" said Judith as she stuck her tongue out in disgust. \"I think it sounds sweet though,\" said KW. \"I'd like to try it with Carol.\" \"And then traditionally after the wedding you and Carol should go someplace else for a while to just be alone with each other and privately celebrate and plan for your new life together. This is called the honeymoon.\" \"That sounds so romantic,\" said KW dreamily. \"I'd love to go someplace special with Carol. And I'm sure he'll have some place very special in mind.\" After they had gathered enough flowers for a large wedding bouquet, Jessica started on her way back to the other side of the island to meet back with Carol and the other guys to tell them where the wedding was to be held. When she finally found them she saw they all had gathered very large armfuls of juicy looking fruits and savory looking plants for eating. \"Hi, guys,\" Jessica greeted. \"I see you all pretty much got all the food we'll need to have a proper wedding feast.\" Carol nodded. \"So how's KW?\" he asked. \"She's doing fine,\" Jessica assured him. \"She is really excited about the wedding, which we've decided we'll have today at sunset over by the violet patch where there's just clear open space.\" \"Okay, that sounds good,\" said Carol pleasantly. Then as Jessica began helping them load the fruits and plants into heavy wooden baskets Carol asked, \"So how do you know so much about weddings and getting married?\" \"Because I was at one once before and I learned all about them then,\" Jessica explained. \"I see,\" said Carol. \"And was it like you tell about it?\" \"Pretty much, yes,\" said Jessica. \"And how is it that you will have the power to bring me and KW together and keep us together?\" Carol asked next. \"No offense,\" he added, \"I'm just curious about that.\" \"Well,\" said Jessica, \"I think it's because I'm the Queen around her and because seeing you two together seems so right. I remember though,\" she added thoughtfully, \"that when I went to my cousin's wedding there was this guy in white who claimed he had the power invested in him by a God.\" \"What is a God?\" asked Carol curiously. \"I guess it's like a King, sort of,\" replied Jessica, \"except its much bigger and much more powerful. And you can never see it because it lives in the sky and its invisible.\" Carol laughed and said, \"How can something so big and powerful be invisible, and how can something live in the sky?\" \"I'd always wondered about that too,\" admitted Jessica. \"And the idea of such a thing always scared me too because its supposed to watch over you all the time and judges you constantly and if you make it mad in any way it punishes you horribly.\" \"Then I guess it's a very good thing that there is no such thing,\" said Carol. \"Yeah, I guess you're right,\" Jessica said with a smile. Then as they began carrying the heavy baskets filled to the brims with the wedding feast Jessica mentioned to Carol, \"After the wedding, you and KW will go somewhere together where you can privately enjoy each others company and plan for your future life together.\" \"I really like that idea,\" said Carol. \"And I know just the place to go, but I'll need a boat to get there.\" \"You can borrow the one that I came here in,\" Jessica said generously. \"Really? Thanks!\" said Carol. \"Then how long should me and KW go there?\" \"For about a week or two at most,\" replied Jessica. \"Excellent!\" said Carol. They then made their way to the violet patch and met up with Judith and KW again. Then as the sun was slowly setting in the sky overhead, Jessica stood up on a stone just big enough to hold her and instructed Carol and KW to stand close together in front of her and for Douglas to stand beside Carol and Judith to stand beside KW and the others to stand in a row behind them which they all did and so then she began the ceremony. \"Dear friends, we are gathered here today to witness the unity of our two friends, Carol and KW.\" She then turned to Carol and asked, \"Do you, Carol, take KW to be you wife? To love, honor, and cherish, and remain faithful to her alone, come what may? For better or for worse, in sickness and in health?\" \"I do,\" Carol said simply. Jessica then turned to KW and asked, \"And do you, KW, take Carol to be your husband? To love, honor, and cherish, and remain faithful to him alone, come what me? For better or for worse, in sickness and in health?\" \"I do,\" KW said simply. Jessica smiled as she said, \"Then by the power invested in me as your Queen I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.\" Then everyone watched in awe as Carol and KW put their lips together and nuzzled against each other. \"You know,\" said Carol after they had ended the kiss, \"you taste pretty good.\" KW then threw her wedding bouquet at their friends and Judith caught it instantly much to her delight. Then as the sun made its final descent over the horizon, the others got the boat and Carol and KW went down to the river that separated the island in two halves and got into the boat waving goodbye to their friend who were wishing them well as they headed off onto their honeymoon.[Chapter 6] It was two weeks later when Carol and KW returned from their honeymoon on the other side of the island. They rowed up the river and were welcomed back happily by their friends and their Queen. \"How was your honeymoon?\" asked Jessica. \"It was wonderful,\" said KW. \"And so romantic.\" \"It was a dream come true for me,\" added Carol. \"I got to know KW like I never did before and I found out how much she really does love me and how much I really do love her.\" \"I thought you would,\" said Jessica smiling. \"Thank you, my Queen,\" said Carol as he bent down to hug Jessica. \"If you hadn't come when you did me and KW wouldn't be so happy with each other right now.\" \"Hey, that is just what us Queens are for,\" replied Jessica grinning. Then it was a few weeks later when Jessica and the other wild things were playing fetch with the big dog with Douglas throwing a fallen tree through the forest for it to go get when Carol came running up to them quickly and waving his arms out frantically. \"Jessica! Jessica!\" he was calling out to her loudly. \"Come with me quickly!\" \"Hey, calm down, Carol,\" said Jessica. \"What's wrong?\" \"It's KW,\" Carol said breathlessly. \"I think she's sick!\" \"Sick? What do you mean sick?\" asked Jessica with concern. \"All she wants to do is lay in bed this morning,\" Carol explained. \"And last night she ate a whole lot of stuff like she never did before and when she woke up today she threw it all up. She also keeps holding her stomach and saying she feels cramps in it. I just don't know what's wrong with her or what to do about it!\" Jessica looked thoughtful as she placed a calming hand on Carol's arm and said, \"I think I know what's wrong with her though, and if I do then there is no need to worry about her. Though I will have to see her before I can be sure of it.\" And so Carol led Jessica to his and K W's house as they were now living in one together. She entered it and found KW laying down in a rather uncomfortable looking position on a bed of leaves and clutching at her stomach and moaning and groaning weakly. \"Hey, KW. It's me. I've come to see you,\" Jessica said soothingly as she approached. \"Ohhh... Jessica,\" wailed KW. \"I don't know why but I feel so sick all of a sudden. Do you think it could have been all of the stuff I ate last night?\" \"Shh... lay still now,\" Jessica said softly. \"I have a feeling I know what is bothering you, but I'll have to feel of your tummy to be sure of it.\" And so saying Jessica laid her hands on K W's stomach and she could feel a very slight yet noticeable bulging in the middle of it as well as feel something else. Then she knew her suspicions had been correct. She looked up at KW and smiled brightly at her. \"Carol, come in now!\" Jessica called to him from inside. Carol came rushing in asking, \"What is it? Is she okay?\" \"KW is going to be just fine,\" Jessica assured him gently. \"You see, she isn't really sick at all. She's just pregnant!\" \"Pregnant? What does that mean?\" asked Carol in confusion. \"It means she is with child now,\" Jessica explained. \"It means she is going to give birth to a baby that is now growing inside of the womb in her stomach. And the pains and morning sickness and food cravings she's been having are only natural things for this early stage in her pregnancy.\" Carol and KW looked much relieved as well as delighted about this information. \"So you mean I'm going to be a Daddy?!\" Carol exclaimed excitedly. \"Yep,\" said Jessica, \"just like KW is going to be a Mommy.\" \"Yay!\" Carol exclaimed and let out a loud howl of happiness. \"How long do I have to wait until the baby comes?\" asked KW. \"Well,\" said Jessica. \"Where I came from babies typically come after being in the womb for nine months or sometimes a little sooner. Though I admit I don't know how long it will be for you. But in the meantime Carol and I will take care of you and give you everything you need to get through this pregnancy.\" And so they did. They and the other wild things attended to K W's every wish and need. They brought all and every kind of food she wanted and Carol was there to help her through her morning sickness and try to keep her comfortable. KW would also have mood swings in which she would tell Carol that she just wanted to be left alone in their home. Jessica assured him that this was also a natural thing for her and that it would come to pass soon. And it did and as the baby continued to grow inside of her her stomach swelled to the size of a watermelon and she became quite giddy with eagerness and anticipation. Carol though he showed happiness for KW about the baby, also seemed a bit nervous and even a touch of melancholy showed in him whenever they talked about and Jessica was quick to notice this. So one day when she was able to be alone with Carol she asked him. \"You seem a little sad. Aren't you happy about the baby coming? Don't you want to be a Daddy?\" \"Well, of course I am, and of course I do,\" Carol assured her. \"It's just that... I'm not sure I'm ready to be a Daddy now. I don't know if I can be a good one. I mean you know how I was with KW and her her two owl friends before we got married. I'm afraid of having the same behavior towards my baby for some reason or another someday.\" \"I understand,\" Jessica said gently as she placed her hand on his arm. \"But you shouldn't have to worry about that, you really shouldn't. Because as long as you love KW you will also love your baby when it comes, and in fact you already do, I can tell. And if you will just use that love for good purposes and put into your child's best interests whatever they may be then you will be the best Daddy that your baby could have. All that matters is that you do your best, and also that you'll have KW with you to help you through it all the way.\" \"I guess you're right,\" said Carol. \"And KW is truly going to be the best Mommy ever to our baby.\" Then it was only a month later, which made for a total of five months since KW had become pregnant, that she woke up and let out a scream as she clutched at her stomach. She had screamed so loud that everyone heard her and they all rushed out of their houses and gathered around the couple's to see what was wrong. \"It's coming! It's coming!\" KW cried out in agony and ecstasy. \"The baby is being born!\" So then everyone went a little crazy at hearing this. Fortunately, Jessica was there to settle everyone down. \"Quiet now! Calm down!\" she said. \"KW is in a lot of pain and she will be for a while now and so she needs your care and attention and cooperation.\" She then instructed everyone on what to do. \"Carol, you just stay beside her and hold her hand. Judith and Douglas, you go get some water. Ira and Alexander, you two get in front of her and help her push out the baby, and Daniel, you catch it when it comes out.\" And so everyone did as she instructed them to, and then in a few hours KW had given birth to an adorable baby. It was a boy and it had a face that resembled both of his parents and had little bits of dark brown hair around his face and a short tuft of hair growing down his back and two small lumps on his head which would eventually grow into horns. \"Hey, he looks just like you, Carol!\" said Douglas. \"And he has his Mommy's eyes, too!\" added Judith as she tickled the baby under his chin and made him giggle. \"What is his name?\" asked Ira. \"How about Carol?\" said KW. \"Carol Junior, and CJ for short.\" Carol looked lovingly at his wife with tears brimming in his eyes as he just knelt by his wife and son and nuzzled them in his arms, too choked up for words. Jessica looked on smiling. She was really very happy for them. She saw a new family appear right before her eyes. Yet at the same time she also felt a mysterious sense of sadness added in. she tried to ignore it though.[Chapter 7] In the months that followed the birth of CJ, Jessica helped his parents and the other wild things raise him. She would rock him to sleep during his crying spells, and she would help KW bathe him, and she would find the best wild berries which KW would mash up to feed him. CJ actually seemed to grow much faster than she knew regular babies did. In fact, he seemed to reach a year old with each passing month. After the first month he learned to walk and run and to speak a few simple words as well as the names of those around him. After the second month he was eating more solid foods and was always eager and ready to play games with anyone who was willing. Jessica taught him how to play tag and hide and seek and she also played horsey with him in which she would carry him on her shoulders and run all around the island with him. Jessica felt she couldn't have been happier living with the wild things on their island and ruling over them and at the same time being their friend. It was the kind of life she always dreamed of having. Then it was on one night after she had tucked CJ into his crib and gone to sleep beside Carol and K W's house in her makeshift bed of leaves that had she had the dream. She dreamed of her parents. She saw her mother crying and wailing over her being gone for so long and her father was blaming her for it and yelling at her and then she started crying harder and yelling back at him. \" She's gone, and she's not coming back! I just know it!\" her mother was sobbing. \" Well, you know it's all your fault, don't you?!\" her father was yelling. \"If you had just let her have homeschooling last year like she and I wanted this never would have happened.\" \" But I never expected anything like this to happen!\" her mother retorted. \"Why are you being so cruel at a time like this? I wish I'd never married you!\" \" Well, you know what? I wish I'd never married you, either!\" her father retorted and with that he left the room and slammed the door behind him. Jessica tossed and turned over in her sleep as these terrible words exchanged between her parents filled her mind. She began muttering to herself in her sleep, \"No, no, no! I'm alright!\" and then she was also crying loudly in her sleep. Carol and KW heard her and went at once to her side. KW picked her up and held her in her arms as she rocked her soothingly as she did with CJ in times like this. \"Jessica, wake up,\" she said. \"You're just having a bad dream. There now, why don't you tell us all about it?\" she asked as she began wiping away Jessica's tears with her fingertips. Jessica woke up fitfully and tried to calm sown as she looked into K W's loving and motherly face, and yet somehow seeing only made her cry even more. \"I saw Mom and Dad,\" she wailed in agony. \"Mom was crying about my running away. And Dad was yelling at her, and then he left her. And he might not come back. And it's all my fault! I should have never run away from home! Never!\" \"There there now,\" KW said soothingly as she held Jessica against her shoulder. \"We all love you here. And we need you. If you hadn't come we wouldn't be as happy as we are now. You've made life for all of us better, and no King ever did that for us.\" \"I want to go home!\" Jessica wailed loudly. \"I just want to go home!\" KW continued to rock and soothe Jessica until finally her tears stopped and she fell back to sleep again. \"What are we going to do?\" KW asked Carol worriedly. \"We can't afford to lose her. She's the best and only Queen we've ever had.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" Carol said to her reassuringly. \"She just had a bad dream and she'll soon forget all about it when morning comes.\" \"I hope you're right,\" said KW. However, when morning came Jessica did not forget about her dream at all. When she woke up she continued to just lay in her bed and didn't feel like doing anything with anyone. She even refused to play with CJ when he came up to her and begged her to play with him. \"Please, Jessica, please play with me!\" he begged in his soft babyish voice. \"No, CJ,\" Jessica said miserably. \"I don't feel like playing today.\" \"Why not?\" asked CJ worriedly. \"Are you sick?\" \"Yes, I am,\" Jessica replied as she turned over onto her side. \"I'm homesick.\" CJ then became very worried and rushed into his house to get his parents for her. \"Mommy! Daddy! Jessica is sick!\" he exclaimed loudly. Carol and KW then came quickly to her and knelt by her side as KW felt of her forehead and said, \"Are you sick? You don't feel warm to me.\" Jessica just nodded and said, \"I'm homesick. I miss my parents and I miss my friends back home. I want to go back home to them.\" \"You mean you want to leave us?\" asked Carol sounding upset. \"But you can't. We need you here. We depend on you. If it hadn't been for you KW and I wouldn't have gotten together and we also wouldn't have CJ with us, either. Please don't leave, you're very important to us and we love you so.\" Jessica now looked at Carol and KW in tears. \"But what about my Mom and Dad? If I don't come back they might leave each other.\" Carol didn't know what to say. So KW spoke instead. \"Well, if you really feel you need to be at home with your parents then we cannot keep you from leaving I'm afraid. We'll go get the boat ready for you.\" Then KW and Carol left to do so. Along the way Carol said to her, \"KW, what do you mean by letting her go like this? I thought you agreed with me we need her here?\" KW just sighed and said, \"I do, Carol. Really. But didn't you see her face. Her heart is breaking and I know what that feels like as I could feel my heart breaking for us when I thought I had to leave you.\" Carol was silent for a moment as he remembered it all too well. \"I know,\" he said softly. \"And I could feel my heart breaking too.\" \"But I still came back every time,\" KW reminded him. \"And, who knows, maybe Jessica will eventually come back to us too.\" \"And maybe so will Max,\" added Carol wistfully. Jessica was left alone as she waited in silence. She was deep in thought as she wondered why she had had that nightmare when she did. Could it mean anything? Could it possibly have even been real? She felt torn between her desire to go back home and to stay here with the wild things. But she knew she couldn't do both. Her thoughts were interrupted when Douglas and Judith came up to her. \"I heard that you're leaving us,\" Judith said. \"Is it true?\" Jessica joust nodded sadly. \"Well,\" said Judith hesitantly. \"Before you go, can you do me and Douglas a favor and marry us?\" Jack smiled in spite of herself as she replied, \"Of course I will.\"[Chapter 8] \"By the power invested in me as your Queen, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride,\" Jessica said to Judith and Douglas in conclusion of their wedding. Judith and Douglas then kissed and after a moment Douglas pulled back and exclaimed, \"Hey, you stuck your tongue in my mouth and touched mine!\" \"I just wanted to see what that feels like,\" said Judith defensively. \"Well, I have to admit it did feel pretty good,\" admitted Douglas. \"I guess I'll just have to get used to it.\" Jessica smiled as she went up to the newlywed couple and said to them, \"I hope you two will be happy together and stay together as long as you live, because marriage is such a special and precious thing to have. Remember that always,\" she added with a slight hint of melancholy to her voice as she remembered about her parents in her dream. \"We will,\" Douglas promised her sincerely. \"So will we,\" agreed Carol. \"Especially now with our little addition,\" he added as he nuzzled CJ who was in his arms. \"Well,\" Jessica said with a sigh. \"I guess now I should be best heading back to my real home now.\" And so saying she took off her crown and put down her scepter. Then Carol quickly went up to her and placed the crown on her head again and handed her back the scepter as he said, \"No, keep them, please. You are the only Queen we've ever had, but you're still the best Queen we could have ever asked for. You and King Max are really very special to us.\" Tears came to Jessica's eyes as Carol had said this. She threw her arms around him in a big hug as she said with her voice all choked with emotion, \"Thank you so much, Carol. I love you, and all of you, too!\" She then went up to KW and hugged her goodbye as well and kissed her cheek. Then she did the same for CJ as she picked him up and rocked him back and forth her arms. CJ let out a little wail and said, \"Please, Jessica, don't go!\" \"She has to go, CJ,\" KW said gently as she took her little one back into her own arms. \"She has a family across the sea just as you have here with me and Daddy.\" \"Will you ever come back and see us again?\" asked CJ tearfully. \"Sure, I will,\" Jessica promised. \"Cross my heart, I will.\" Everyone cheered up then. They then all led Jessica to the edge of the sea where the boat was waiting for her. As she climbed aboard the tiny vessel Carol helped her in and when she sat down in it he gave the boat a gentle push out into the water. Jessica hoisted the sails and began to sail away from the island. She looked back at her beloved friends as they all waved goodbye to her and she waved back to them. She heard Carol call out to her, \"If you see Max when you get back, tell him we love him and we miss him!\" \"I will!\" Jessica called back to him just as her boat sailed into the deep part of the sea and drifted out away far from the island. Jessica sailed for the day and night and half of the next day. Then she came up to the shore of her own home at the edge of the woods. She docked the little boat and then got out of it and darted through the woods and then ran swiftly through her neighborhood. She didn't slow down an instant until she finally reached her house. She opened the door as it was unlocked and went inside. \"Mom! Dad! It's me! I'm home!\" she called out. Then she felt herself being instantly enveloped in her mother's embrace as she picked her up and squeezed her so tightly she almost stopped breathing. \"Jessica! Where were you? Me and your father were so worried to death about you!\" her mother said as she kissed her face. \"I'm sorry I ran away, Mom,\" said Jessica, although that wasn't quite true as she knew if she hadn't run away she wouldn't have met the wild things.\" \"You've been gone for almost eight months!\" her mother said as she slowly released her grip around her. She stood back a bit and looked her over, \"and you've grown so much since then.\" Jessica really felt her mother was right about that. There was still one thing though, \"Do I have to repeat the fifth grade when school starts again?\" she asked with dread. \"Yes,\" he mother replied, \"But,\" she added quickly, \"you won't be actually going to school ever again. I've already made arrangements for you to have homeschooling starting in September.\" Jessica felt so relieved and she hugged her mother again. \"Thanks, Mom! I love you!\" Then Jessica went to see Max and she told him all about her experience of meeting his friends the wild things. \"They said they really miss you and they want you to come back to them,\" she told him. \"And I promised them that I would come back to them someday.\" \"I would really like to go back to them someday,\" Max said. \"Hey! Maybe someday you and I can both go back there! I would really love to meet CJ.\" \"That sounds great!\" said Jessica. \"And the boat is just big enough for two.\" And one day Max and Jessica would indeed go back to the island of the wild things and learn many new things about their friends. But that is another story. ","Summary":" \"Goodbye, Laura.

LOL I know this isn't a very bright idea, making a new story since I've got two other to update and all, but I was brainstorming last night, and I thought that this would be a fun idea. So I'm gonna try it, and in the event that no one likes it, I'll remove it and say that I at least made an attempt. Since inserting Bella the Vampire into my other WTWTA fanfic, I had the idea to write a story about her life as a character inside Max's creative mind. I know that this is treading on dangerous grounds because: 1) Bella has some Mary-Sue tendencies, and 2) going into Max's brain means creating other characters to live there. I assure you that I'll try my best at this, and like I said, if no one likes it, I will delete this. DISCLAIMER: I don't own WTWTA or the movie or the book or anything related. But I do own all the OCs that I create in this story. And I don't own the title, either (which was inspired by Alice in Wonderland ). SUMMARY: Bella the Vampire's life in Max's drawings was the perfect balance of adventure and happiness. Then the fateful day comes when he locks her away in his mind. There she stays for four years, unhappy and lonely, until she finds the door to freedom and escapes. Now she must face Max and the Wild Things, and in a course of startling events, their lives are changed - forever. Enjoy![Chapter 2] This takes place when Bella is playing Titanic in her tree house and Max wants to play with her, but she, obviously, tells him off. This is what happens after he leaves. Prologue: A New Start Max sadly walked to the backyard, dropping his toy dump truck with a thud. His older sisters were, once again, ignoring him. Claire had gone off to with one of her friends, and Bella had vehemently denied him the chance to climb up in her tree house. Was there something wrong with him? Was there a reason no one ever seemed to want him around? No one wikes me anymow… he thought to himself sadly, starting to cry. Don't cry, Max… came a voice out of nowhere. Max looked up. \"Who said dat?\" he asked in his toddler drawl, whipping around. \"Belly? Claywa?\" No one came out. Max figured that the person was scared of him, and, this realization being very hard on him, cried some more. Please don't cry… came the voice again. Max peeked through his fingers. \"Why can't Maxie see you?\" he asked. I'm a little shy, the voice said. But if you look really hard, I'll bet you'll be able to see me. Max scrunched up his eyes, having the strange feeling that only he knew what this person looked like. He imagined brown hair, hazel eyes, pale skin… He opened his eyes and saw a girl in front of him. She looked to be about Bella's age; in fact…she looked like Bella, too… \"Who awe you?\" Max asked. \"I'm your imaginary friend,\" the person said, smiling. She even sounded like Bella. Max became angry. \"No yow not,\" he said. \"Maxie doesn't wanna see Belly wite now.\" The person didn't go away. \"Who's Belly?\" \"You awe,\" Max said. \"You don't wike me. You hate me.\" The person sighed, then was suddenly gone. Max was happy that she'd disappeared, and went back to playing with his truck. His happiness didn't last long. Five seconds later, the person was back. \"Is…is Bella your sister?\" Max nodded. \"That's you. Now go away. Maxie wants to be by hisswelf.\" \"Max, Bella is still in her tree house. I'll show you.\" She held his hand, and before Max knew it, they were standing at the base of the huge tree in the front yard. Up in the tree house was Bella, humming to herself. Max was confused. \"But…why do you wook wike Belly if yow not her?\" \"I'm your imaginary friend,\" the person reminded him. \"You made me look this way.\" She looked up at Bella. \"I think you miss her.\" They returned to the backyard, where Max broke down in a fit of crying. \"Why does Belly hate me?\" he asked. \"Maxie nevew did anyfing to her!\" \"Max, calm down,\" the person said, putting a hand on his shoulder. \"It's gonna be okay.\" Max looked at the person. \"Wiw you be my sistew instead?\" The person giggled. \"No, I'm afraid I can't. But I can be your friend, and I can play games with you.\" Max liked this idea of having a friend. \"Weely?\" \"Uh-huh. Whenever you wanna play, all you have to do is think of me, and there I'll be.\" Max nodded. \"OK.\" He looked at her again. \"Awe you a pewson or a angel?\" The person frowned. \"I don't know. I'm whatever you want me to be. It's your imagination.\" Max thought for a moment. \"I want you to be…a vampiwe!\" The person nodded. \"Okay.\" She opened her mouth, and suddenly two fangs appeared. \"Cool!\" Max exclaimed. \"What else can you do?\" \"That's up to you,\" the person answered. \"Um…you can eat both peoples and aminals! And…yow weely fast, and stwong!\" \"Sounds good,\" the person said. \"Are you gonna give me a name?\" \"Uh-huh,\" Max said. \"Yow gonna be…Belly.\" \"Bella?\" \"Yep.\" Max's smile grew. \"Belly…the Vampiwe!\"[Chapter 3] Thanks to CarolJudithFan for reviewing! - CHAPTER ONE: HAPPY BIRTHDAY! It was dark. That was all she knew. The dark that she'd been in for so long. It was back. She felt around, trying to find some sort of light. That's what it was called, wasn't it? The glowing brightness that made it easier to see. She had heard Max call it that…or maybe he'd called it something else… Her hand brushed over something. An opening of sorts. What was it doing here, in the dark? She made to push it open when she hesitated. What was waiting on the other side? Something that would eat her? Whatever was there, it couldn't be any worse than the dark. She hated the dark. It was where she'd been changed only a few moments ago. She'd been a mere soul, floating, waiting to become something. She had felt herself take the form of a ten-year-old girl, and suddenly, there she was, on soft green stuff and in front of a little boy. She had no idea what to say to him or what to do; it had all just come to her somehow. It was like someone was putting words into her mouth, and she was saying them. She thought about her life as a soul. It was a simple sort of life, just hanging in space, not doing anything. Humans were much different from souls. They were loud, and very unpredictable. Bella wasn't sure she wanted to be shaped in the form of a human. She took a deep breath, and pushed the door open. On the other side were two massive oak doors, with gilded handles and intricate carvings on its panels. Light – she was sure that's what it was called – poured from under the doors, illuminating the small room she had just entered. In front of the doors was a boy in white, with big fluffy things coming out of his back. \"Welcome to the world of Max's Mind,\" he said. His voice was very nice, almost like music. Bella stared at him. \"Mind?\" she repeated. \"Yes. This is Max's Mind.\" \"What is a Mind?\" The boy looked at her as though she'd sprouted a second head. \"You don't know what a Mind is?\" \"No.\" \"It's a Brain. A Cranium. The place where Thoughts are born.\" Thoughts… Thoughts were in the head, so that meant that this Mind had to be….She pointed to her head. \"You've got it. This is the Mind of Max. Actually, the Mind is on the other side of these doors. I'm the gatekeeper, Matthew. I am an angel.\" \"Angel?\" She had heard that word once before. Max had asked her if she was one. Was she? \"An angel? White clothes, huge wings?\" He pointed behind him at the fluffy things. \"Sweet and angelic?\" Bella cocked her head. Matthew sighed. \"I can see that you have much to learn about this world. Can I at least have your name? You do know what a name is, right?\" Bella nodded, trying to remember what that was. It was an address, something a person knew you by. What had Max named her? Bellow…Belly…Bella…Bella! \"My name is Bella,\" she said, then added, \"Bella the Vampire.\" Matthew raised his eyebrows. \"Vampire, huh? Can I see…you know…\" He pointed to his mouth. \"Fangs?\" She remembered Max using that term. \"Yes. Fangs.\" She opened her mouth, and he looked in. \"Very cute fangs you have there,\" he commented. \"Thank you.\" She wasn't sure what \"cute\" was, but it sounded like he liked her teeth. \"What do you eat? Humans? Animals?\" What had Max told her she ate? Wasn't it humans and animals? \"Both,\" she finally said. \"Any special abilities?\" \"I can…run…fast,\" she recounted slowly. \"And I'm…strong, too.\" Matthew nodded. \"What type of Being are you?\" \"A vampire…\" She wasn't sure why he was asking this; he already knew. \"Oh, no,\" he said, laughing in a kind way. \"A vampire is the type of species that you are. A Being is like a Thought, a Feeling…\" Bella shook her head. \"I'm…I'm not sure…\" \"What was the first thing you told Max when you appeared?\" Bella's eyes widened. How had he known about that? Despite her fear, she remembered her words and repeated them. \"I'm his imaginary friend.\" \"An I.F.,\" said Matthew, more to himself than to her. \"First one. Oh, they are going to love you.\" \"Who?\" \"The other Beings in the Mind,\" Matthew said. \"Surely you didn't think there was just me?\" \"How many are there?\" Matthew shook his head, laughing. \"I can't even keep track of how many Beings come in and out of Max's mind each day. There are just too many. You'll see what I mean.\" He turned around and pushed open the great oak doors. It hit her so fast she wasn't sure how she was going to take it all in. There were very tall, boxy things, with clear square openings dotting them everywhere, outlining a blue sky with fluffy clouds. There were gray flat things where big clunky machines rode on. And people. People everywhere. No, not all of them were people. Some had three heads, some had four eyes; multiple limbs, different skin colors. And the noise. The air was full of it. Honks, beeps, yells came from every direction. \"Welcome to Max's Mind,\" said Matthew proudly. \"I'll give you a tour after your initiation.\" \"What?\" Bella asked. She hadn't heard him over the roar of the noise, and she also didn't know what this in-ish-ee-ashion was. \"Hang on,\" Matthew said. He led her to the middle of the boxy things, where a wooden square stood. They climbed on, and Matthew pulled a stick that stuck out of the bottom. They began to rise in the air, like magic. The Beings looked up as the square lifted into the air. Bella was too frightened to wave, so she just stared at all of them, trying to memorize their shapes and colors. Matthew took a gray stick and started to talk into it. \"Attention!\" came his voice from the little box at the top of the stick (more magic!). \"Attention the Beings of Max's Mind!\" The noise instantly died away. All were watching the two of them. Bella didn't know if she liked this. \"This is Bella the Vampire!\" Matthew told them. \"The very first Imaginary Friend!\" A roar came from the creatures below. They looked to be smacking their hands and tentacles and claws together in approval. \"And you all know what that means!\" Matthew said. The Beings all started chatting excitedly as big multi-colored bubbles began to appear on the wooden square. Out of nowhere came a colorful rectangle with the words \"Happy Birthday!\" on it. Matthew moved his arms, and everyone began to sing a song called \"Happy Birthday To You.\" Bella wasn't sure if she should be flattered or not. \"Blow out the candle!\" Matthew whispered as one single stick burned with a little light. Bella looked at him. \"What's blow?\" Matthew made air come from his mouth, and Bella copied him, accidentally making the light on the stick go out. \"I broke it!\" she exclaimed. \"No, that's what was supposed to happen!\" Matthew said as the Beings slapped their hands together again. \"We're celebrating your birthday!\" \"Birthday?\" \"You know…the day you were born? From the Hall of Thinks?\" Bella stared blankly at him. \"Like I said, you have a lot to learn.\" He handed her a piece of the rectangle. \"Birthday Girl gets the first piece.\"[Chapter 4] Hey! Thanks to everyone who's reviewing and reading! It means so much to me! P.S. The idea about the paper airplanes - called messages from the Brain - are a reference to those cute little airplane things at the Ministry of Magic in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. But I obviously don't own that. If I did, I'd be worth more than the Queen of England (or so I've been told that's how much Rowling is worth...). Enjoy! - CHAPTER TWO: THE MIND OF A TODDLER After eating two slices of cake (the colorful rectangle), Bella was given a tour of her new home. She couldn't believe how huge it was. Beyond the city (the huge boxy things) were endless green valleys, numerous little villages, dark forests, and modern-day suburbs. There was even a castle where some of Max's more royal creations lived. She learned that each particle from Max's Mind came from the Hall of Thinks, which was what a Being was called before it actually took a distinct form. Matthew showed Bella the little floating orbs that were patiently awaiting their exciting new lives. She even saw a few disappear, and Matthew explained that they had appeared somewhere else in the Mind, depending on what they had become. She learned all about the different types of Beings. The majority of Max's mind was filled with Thoughts – haphazard human children running every which way, dressed in different colors, depending on if they were a Good or Bad Thought. When they were bumped into, they stated their names, which varied in length. The one Bella remembered distinctly was a little boy dressed in gray. \"My-sister-doesn't-like-me,\" was his name. Feelings, or Emotions, were easier to spot. All of them looked like Max, and were dressed exactly like he was. They were a bit crazier than Thoughts were, and talked of their business whether anyone cared or not. \"They think highly of themselves,\" Matthew muttered. \"Being Max's Emotions and all.\" The colorful monsters and humans that lived in the city were the Nerves. They sent what Matthew called Impulses to Max's Feelings. \"What will happen is one of the Nerves will receive a message from the Brain,\" Matthew told her, pointing to little paper airplanes zooming in the air. \"And it will say what Max is feeling. The Nerve will then take one of the Impulses\" – he held up an arm band – \"and send it to that particular Feeling. The Impulse will wrap around the Feeling's wrist and connect back to the Center of the Brain.\" The Beings who didn't live in the city were merely Characters, like she was. They had played a part in Max's drawings and stories, and were going to be used sometime again. \"The ones he doesn't use anymore go to the House of Retirement.\" Matthew gestured to a big house sitting atop a hill. \"Every time a Character is no longer needed in Max's life, he or she is sent there.\" \"It looks kind of small…\" Bella said, thinking about all the discarded Characters there had to be. \"It's bigger on the inside, and it grows when there's a new arrival.\" \"What do they do in there?\" Matthew shrugged. \"I think they party or something. I don't know, once they go in, they never come out.\" Bella stared at him. \"They can't leave?\" \"Oh, no, they can if they want. They're allowed to visit current Characters. It's just that doesn't happen all that often. From the ones that have talked to me, I think they must really like it in there.\" Bella noticed that like the roads (the gray flat things on the ground), there was a string of flat squares – called screens – that ran in different directions. Each screen had buttons on it. \"These are Memories,\" Matthew said. \"They're accessible to any Being in the Mind. They're labeled, and all you have to do is press the 'Play' button.\" He picked one that bore the name, \"Playing with Claire #6\". In it, Max was playing tag with an older girl, whom Bella guessed was Claire. She quickly learned from the Memory that this was Max's eldest sister. From what she saw, she decided that Claire was much more pleasant to be around than the real Bella. \"What are those?\" Bella pointed to four-legged barking animals that bounded after each other, decked in either angel wings or devil horns. \"Those are Dreams,\" Matthew explained. \"Modeled after Max's dog, Stumpy. The ones with the wings are Good Dreams, and the ones with the Horns are Bad.\" \"Can you get rid of Bad Dreams?\" Matthew nodded. \"We have something called a Wizzo-Shooter. You load one of the Bad Dreams in, and…WHAM! Out they go!\" \"Where do they end up?\" Matthew frowned. \"Hard to say. We don't normally get the same Dream in here more than three times, so I'm guessing they go out one of the Exit doors.\" A blur flew by, and a smack was heard. Bella turned to see that a boy, about two years older than she was, had run into a nearby tree. His light-brown hair was cropped short, and he had medium-sized biceps bulging out of his shirt. He began to rub his head, clearly disoriented. \"Are…are you alright?\" Bella asked. \"Just a scratch,\" the boy said, waving her off. \"I'm okay, really.\" \"You're certain?\" she asked, although she could see that there was no bump or anything on him. \"Well, considering vampires don't get nicked up too often…\" \"You're a vampire?\" Bella's eyes widened in surprise. The boy, now standing, shrugged. \"Um…was it that obvious?\" \"No. Was it supposed to be?\" The boy looked at her in a way that reminded her of Matthew. \"You're new, aren't you?\" Bella nodded. \"I just got here. I'm Bella,\" she said brightly, sticking out her hand. \"I'm…Dan…\" He shook her hand, and looked over her shoulder at Matt. \"She's an Imaginary Friend,\" Matthew informed Dan. \"She's…she's not up to snuff, let's just say.\" \"Oh.\" Comprehension dawned on Dan's face. \"Yeah. I was like that when I was new.\" He smiled at her. \"Pretty scary at first, huh?\" Bella shook her head. \"You have no idea…\" Matthew coughed. \"I believe that you've had enough excitement for one day,\" he said. \"It's almost nighttime in the Outside World, anyway.\" \"Where am I going to live? And sleep?\" \"I can show her where our clan lives,\" Dan offered. \"I'm sure they'd love to have her.\" \"Okay, then.\" Matthew waved. \"I'll come tomorrow, and we can finish the tour.\" He nodded at Dan. \"Take care of her. She's the first I.F., you know.\" - \"So…this is where I'm gonna live?\" Dan had taken her to a small circle of cottages on the edge of one of the forests. It was two levels, with the bedroom being on the top floor. \"Yeah. I know it doesn't seem like much, but vampires spend a lot of their time outside,\" Dan said. \"Max likes to write about us a lot.\" \"Writes? What's that?\" Dan laughed. \"You'll see tomorrow. I gotta get back to my own place. Don't wanna be out when the Dreams are loose. They're pretty crazy.\" \"Yeah…\" \"Well…good night.\" Dan nodded and walked out of the room. \"Good night,\" Bella answered, and as soon as she lay down on the bed, she fell asleep.[Chapter 5] Hey, everyone! Sorry I haven't updated in a while. The computer at my house was being used by someone other than me for a VERY IMPORTANT research paper...and y'all know my policy of school comes first. *sheepish grin* But the good news is that this week I'm off from school, and since I'm a loser with no life because I'm not going anywhere fun, I have time to update all three of my stories! YAY! So here's another chapter! Enjoy! - Chapter Three: SOS Bella awoke with a joggle – a jerkle – a jerk – the next morning. She sat straight up to see Matthew and Dan on either side of her bed. \"What…what are you doing here?\" she asked. \"Did something happen?\" \"Nothing's wrong,\" Matthew said. He seemed almost amused. \"I just came to get you for your first official day on the job.\" \"This early?\" She pointed out the window, where the sun was rising through dusty rose-colored clouds. Dan nodded grimly. \"Max had a Bad Dream. Based on how long it took to get it into the Wizzo-Shooter, it's a doozy.\" \"What does this have to do with me?\" \"Do you feel anxious?\" Matthew asked all of a sudden. \"What?\" Bella had no idea how this was supposed to help. \"Do you feel anxious?\" Matthew repeated. \"Like you need to leave right now?\" Bella thought for a moment, and finally nodded. \"Yes. Now that you mention it, that's…that's exactly how I feel.\" \"I see.\" Matthew gave her a knowing smile. \"That's good.\" \"It's good?\" Bella couldn't see how wanting to leave this place was a good thing. How was this supposed to help Max? \"All it means is that you're being called by Max,\" Dan explained. \"What about his mother? Or his sisters?\" \"His sisters are still asleep,\" Matthew informed her, \"but his mother's already calmed him down. I think it's just getting him to go back to sleep that's the problem.\" Bella looked at the two of them skeptically. \"And he wants to see me?\" \"I don't think it's a matter of want,\" Dan said honestly. \"I think Max needs you.\" Bella took this in. \"Oh.\" She had seen how his little face had been when his sister wouldn't play with him, and how badly she'd worked at making sure he'd felt better. That same feeling was now present once again, and she felt herself wanting to leave and help Max. \"Come on,\" Matthew said. \"Let's get to the Exit.\" - \"You're sure this will work?\" Bella asked. They were standing in front of a plain-looking door, with the words \"Exit\" above it in red letters. \"Yeah. Just open the door, and there you'll be.\" \"Will…will I come back?\" \"Of course you will!\" Matthew laughed. \"When Max is feeling better, he'll send you back here.\" \"Alright.\" She gave a little wave. \"See you later.\" She opened the door, and out she went. - She was sitting in a strange-looking room, filled with little figures of people and buildings. Outside the sky was still dark with little tiny holes of light poking through. In front of her was Max, crying profusely into his covers. \"Max? What's wrong?\" she asked. He looked up. \"Belly?\" \"It's me,\" she said. \"I'm…I'm back.\" \"Awe you the nice Belly?\" Bella thought for a moment before nodding. \"Um…yes.\" Max's eyes bubbled with wet. \"I had a bad dweam.\" \"I heard. What happened in it?\" \"Belly told me she didn't wov me anymow,\" Max said. \"And Mommy and Claywa and Daddy said so, too. They left me aw awone.\" The wet began to fall down his face. Bella was fascinated for a moment. She didn't know humans could leak. \"Are you broken?\" she asked. \"Huh?\" \"Your eyes. They're leaking wet. Are they supposed to do that?\" \"I'm cwying,\" said Max. \"We do that when we'w sad.\" More of the wet rolled down his cheeks. Bella reached out, transfixed. She caught one of the round drops on her finger and stared at it. \"It's beautiful,\" she said. \"Cwying isn't pwetty. It's bad. I don't wike it.\" As he said this, more of it came forth, as if he couldn't help it. Bella felt her chest begin to clench. \"Do you need a hug?\" Max nodded, unable to talk. Before she could do so, he threw his arms around her waist, crying into her sweater. He made soft noises, and his breaths were deep and heavy. She carefully put her own arms around his shoulders and started to rock back and forth. \"It's alright, Max…it was only a dream…\" \"I want Mommy and Daddy to not fight anymow,\" Max said. \"I want Claywa and Belly to wike me.\" Bella continued to rock him, not sure what to say. \"I know, Max…I know…\" - \"Great job!\" Matthew said when she came back through the oak front doors. \"It went better than I thought it would.\" \"It did?\" Bella didn't think so. Max had gone back to sleep, but she couldn't help but worry for the poor boy. His parents were separated, and his older sisters weren't paying much attention to him. He was lonely and seemingly unappreciated, something she felt that no child his age should go through. \"Is…everything alright?\" Matthew asked. \"You seem pale.\" \"I already am pale…\" \"I mean paler than usual. Did Max say something?\" \"He just told me about his family.\" \"Oh, yes.\" Matthew cringed. \"I'm aware of his situation.\" Bella sighed. \"I wish there was something I could do to help.\" \"There's nothing more you can do than what you just did,\" Matthew assured her. \"We may be a powerful part of Max, but we can't change the way things are.\" \"Even if we wanted to?\" \"Even if we wanted to,\" Matthew said regretfully. \"So when Max makes all those wishes…I can't fulfill them?\" Bella asked, already knowing what the answer is. \"Well, you're no fairy godmother,\" Matthew joked lightly. \"They don't exist in the Outside World.\" He gave her a reassuring smile. \"You're doing fine. Trust me. If there's something more you could do, I'll let you know.\" \"Okay,\" Bella said, still very unconvinced. \"Come on,\" Matthew said. \"We can finish your tour, and then you'll meet your new family of vampires.\" But even as he said this, Bella had started to tune everything out. There had to be someway to help Max. And whatever that way was, she was going to find out.[Chapter 6] The name Mahree I got from this awesome Disney Channel Original Movie called \"The Color of Friendship\" that talked about discrimination and learning to accept other people despite the color of their skin. Mahree is one of the main characters, and she and her family live in Africa. Chapter Four: Not One of Us \"Well…this is us,\" Dan said, waving his hand. \"This is my clan.\" After seeing the rest of her new home, Dan had taken Bella with him to meet the other vampires. They were standing in front of what looked like a juice bar, with a dozen or so children their age sitting on stools or leaning against the counter. Some of them were holding cups with a red-looking liquid in them. \"Don't be shy,\" Dan told her. \"They're all really friendly.\" She could tell that there was uncertainty in his voice, but she wasn't going to let that bother her. \"Hey, Danny Boy!\" one of the boys called, a smirk on his face. \"Where've you been? Picking flowers in the meadow again?\" Bella felt Dan tense up. The boy who had addressed him had dirty blonde hair and was dressed in a charcoal-black suit with a tie that matched the liquid in his cup. His eyes were a smoky gray with flecks of gold. \"None of your business, John,\" Dan said angrily. The boy called John leapt from his perch on a stool and approached them. He fixed his eyes upon Bella. \"Who do we have here?\" he asked menacingly. \"Don't tell me you picked up another—\" \"This is Bella,\" Dan cut in. \"She's Max's Imaginary Friend.\" Bella noticed that John seemed surprised at this, but ploughed on anyway. \"So you came here to gloat about how she's your new girlfriend?\" A few of the vampires snickered behind John. Bella saw the others look concerned. One in particular, a girl with pretty blonde hair and sparkly blue eyes that were the same color as her dress, seemed hurt by John's comment. \"No,\" Dan said through clenched teeth. \"She's a vampire. I figured she could live with us.\" John snickered and shook his head. \"Dan, Dan, Dan. Poor, troubled Dan. I thought that, as you were the, and I quote, 'last vampire', we weren't accepting any newcomers into our clan.\" Bella looked at her friend. \"Dan? Is that true?\" He didn't answer. He looked like John had slapped him in the face. \"I didn't think Max would make anymore vampires. I forgot about our pact.\" \"Oh, it's true, all right,\" John answered. \"So I'm afraid that you, my dear, will have to go back where you came from.\" \"I have nowhere else to go,\" Bella said. John's face feigned sympathy. \"Oh, no. That's just too bad.\" He rolled his eyes and turned around. \"Dan, you best take her back to Matthew. I suddenly feel…hungry…\" \"You know the rules,\" the blonde vampire said gravely, standing up and facing John. \"We cannot feed on one another. It's impossible to do, anyway.\" \"It. Was. A. Joke,\" John said meanly. \"Chill, Mahree.\" \"How can I 'chill' when you're threatening to do something that goes against our laws? And to someone as innocent as she is?\" John laughed harshly. \"I should have expected you'd say something like this. After all, you would stand up for the weaklings.\" \"And you would eat all of them.\" The vampires who had snickered made sounds in their throats that almost sounded like growls. John's cocky smile fled from his face. \"I can't help the way I'm wired to live,\" he told her seriously. \"And neither can you.\" He moved his glare to Bella. \"Dan, I want you to keep an eye on this one. She may be a vampire, but she's not one of us.\" He nodded to those who had been growling, and they left. Bella stared after them, unable to move and too shocked to speak. This was supposed to be her new family? \"Sorry about John,\" Dan said to Bella. \"He thinks he's Max's gift to the Mind just because he feeds on humans.\" This was something that had been bothering her. \"When you say feed…do you mean…\" \"He drinks blood, Bella.\" Bella knew what blood was. It was the sticky red stuff that helped humans live. But if vampires drank blood, did that mean… \"We kill people. And animals. We drain their blood. Don't we?\" Dan seemed uncomfortable. \"No, I wouldn't say—\" \"What, then?\" Bella was angry now. \"It's our life source. It's how we survive.\" \"How we survive?\" Bella cried. \"We're monsters!\" \"Not all of us.\" The blonde girl had come up to them. \"Some of us don't hunt for our food.\" \"Then how—\" \"That's what the juice bar is for.\" She held up her cup. \"Always supplied with all types of blood - both human and animal. They carry O- now, actually.\" \"Where does the blood come from?\" Bella demanded. The girl shrugged. \"It's just there. I think Max is aware that some of us don't like the idea of…\" She didn't finish, knowing it was a very touchy subject. \"Then how do the others...\" \"Max creates humans and animals for those who like to hunt, but he doesn't give them brains or feelings. They're just...there. They don't feel anything when they're killed. And although I feel uneasy about it, I'll admit that it's almost humane.\" \"Oh. Well, that isn't so bad, I guess.\" The girl smiled. \"You're very cute,\" she said. Bella frowned. \"Cute? What's that?\" Matthew had said her fangs were \"cute\", but she didn't know what it meant. \"She's new,\" Dan explained. Bella saw his face was beet red. \"She…doesn't understand everything.\" \"That's all right,\" the girl said. \"We all are a bit confused at first.\" She held out her hand. \"I'm Mahree.\" \"I'm Bella.\" \"Nice to meet you, Bella.\" Dan cleared his throat rather loudly. Bella was about to ask him why on earth he was doing this when Mahree spoke. \"It's good to see you…making friends, Dan.\" \"So you're gonna listen to John?\" Dan asked, his face turning a deeper shade of red. \"I'm just helping Matthew show her the ropes. I swear.\" \"Oh, no, I believe you,\" Mahree assured him. \"It's just…you're not very good at making friends.\" \"I am too.\" Bella could tell he wasn't really angry. Mahree giggled. \"Whatever you say.\" Her face was turning red, as well. Bella wasn't entirely sure, but she thought it looked like Dan and Mahree liked each other. \"What did he mean by I'm not one of you?\" she asked. Mahree sighed. \"John doesn't like newcomers. Come to think of it, he doesn't like most people. He thinks that those who feed on human blood are the 'real' vampires. To him, humans aren't living, breathing souls with something to give in this world. They only exist to be eaten by his kind.\" Bella took this in, and quickly went to her next question. \"What about the ones who feed on animals?\" \"He thinks were weaker, not as tough. He calls us squeamish because we can't stand the thought of drinking blood of the beings we were modeled after. Also, animal blood isn't as potent as human blood.\" \"And the ones who drink both?\" Mahree frowned in confusion, then comprehension dawned on her face. \"There aren't many of those. But I'm guessing you're one.\" Bella nodded. \"Well, including you…there are only two in existence.\" \"Who's the other?\" Dan looked down at his feet. \"Me.\" Bella gasped. \"You drink both, too?\" He nodded. \"John's had a bone to pick with me since Max created me. To him and his buddies, I'm dangerous, because I can stomach both human and animal blood. They think I'll be more powerful than they are.\" \"That's not fair!\" \"A lot of things aren't,\" Mahree said with a sad smile. \"But all of that's gonna change. Matthew announced that we're gonna vote for a new Head of the clan soon.\" \"He did?\" Dan asked. Mahree nodded, excited. \"This is our chance to make a difference. John and his followers have been bullying us way too long – all because we haven't had a Head reinforcing rules. And since the majority of us don't like those goons, we're sure to be rid of them.\" \"I don't know…\" \"I'm sure Bella wants a change. Don't you?\" Bella wasn't sure how to answer. She'd known John for all of two seconds, but already she found him rather unpleasant. And if he was as bad as Mahree and Dan said, then she hoped he was put in his place. \"Yeah. You guys don't deserve to be put down. We're all one big family. You guys might have disagreements, but that doesn't mean you need to hate each other.\" Even as she said the words, Bella realized what needed to happen with Max's family. They needed to look beyond their arguments and fights and see that, at the root of it all, they were family. And no one messed with family. Not even its members. \"Bella? What are you thinking about?\" Dan and Mahree were peering at her curiously. \"Nothing. I just…I think I might have found a way to help Max with his sister.\" Both of the other vampires seemed interested in this. \"Poor Max could use some assistance,\" Mahree finally said. \"He's always so depressed about things.\" \"Come on,\" Bella said, happier than she had been a moment before. \"I'll tell you about it over some blood.\"[Chapter 7] A/N: Hey! Sorry I haven't been updating any of my stories! I'm once again faced with a full schedule, in which writing fanfics falls WAY DOWN the list, unfortunately! But in a couple of weeks, I should have ample free time to write. So don't lose faith! I'll update ASAP! About This Chapter: I'm introducing a new character. Her name is Juniper, and she is the Seer of the Beyond in Max's Mind. She has visions of what is to come for Max and the Beings in his mind. She passes them on to no one other than Matthew, and using them as a sort of roadmap, he then tells those in charge of the Mind so they can regulate what goes on there (and prevent any potential malfunctions and stuff). The downside of this is that Juniper must stay isolated from the other Beings, for reasons that are revealed in the chapter below. Enjoy! - Chapter Five: They Have Me Trapped \"You really think talking to him about working things out is going to work?\" Dan asked uncertainly. \"It has to,\" Bella insisted, sipping blood from her straw. \"I mean, I spend almost every day with him, and sometimes he likes to simply sit and talk about what's been going on.\" \"You have to take into account he's only three,\" Mahree put in. Bella sighed. \"I really don't like talking down to him. I know much less about the world than he does. It seems wrong. And I think he's aware of a lot more than anyone gives him credit for.\" Mahree nodded. \"I have a feeling you're right, Bella. But I'm just not sure. Matthew knows from experience that we're not here to solve Max's problems for him. All we do is play parts in his stories, and maybe nudge him in the right direction now and then, but we cannot outright state something he needs to do.\" \"She's right,\" Dan said. \"I don't think this is a good idea. No one's ever done something like this before.\" Bella knew how her friends felt, but she had a nagging in her mind that told her she needed to do this. \"There's always a first time…right?\" - Try as she might, Bella was beginning to feel the burden of being a figment of Max's Imagination. She would hint at what she thought Max should do about his family, or sometimes say it out of the blue. Each time, it was as if Max hadn't even heard her. To him, it felt like a sudden wind picked up and blew by, disappearing as fast as it had come. She became discouraged after that, and stopped suggesting things to him. His crying fits came faster and bigger. Bella found herself getting very little sleep at night. Don't complain. You're Max's Imaginary Friend. You're doing your job. You're doing your job… - A beautiful redhead was sitting under her favorite tree, gazing at the birds as they soared by. Her sea-blue eyes pinpointed all of her surroundings in detail. She carefully smoothed the wrinkles of her white halter dress, waiting patiently. She finally saw him. He landed in front of her, his big white wings folding behind him. His red hair was a bit messy from the wind whistling through it. She smiled. \"I was beginning to worry about you,\" she said, her voice melodic. He began to brush himself off. \"You know I'm very busy, Juniper,\" he replied. \"I'm Keeper of the Gate, after all.\" \"And my job is a simple task? The last time I checked, being clairvoyant wasn't exactly easy.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Leave it to my younger sister to hound me about working.\" \"I was just teasing, Matthew. You do a very good job at what you do.\" He gave her a warm smile. \"I know you were joking. But thank you, anyway. So…what's this important business that you told me we need to talk about?\" Her face creased in concentration. \"I'm concerned for one of Max's Characters. A vampire. Her name is Bella. She's his Imaginary Friend.\" Matthew nodded. \"Nothing I don't already know. I've personally seen that she adjusts properly to our world.\" \"She's been trying to persuade Max into working things out with his family.\" Matthew sighed, perturbed. \"I suspected as much. I've been watching them through the Sneak-O-Scope, and from Max's perspective, she doesn't say much. It's all censored out because of the restriction.\" \"Yes…the restriction.\" \"Is that a bad thing?\" Juniper's eyes gave a momentary flash of fear. \"You know where I stand when it comes to influencing Max in the right direction. There has to be some other way.\" \"Juni…who better to be his Conscience than a version of Max himself?\" \"He's too young. He's not even all human.\" \"And you aren't?\" She rolled her eyes good-naturedly. \"You're missing my point. His wild tendencies might not be a good influence on Max.\" \"He'll grow up. We all have to at some point.\" She stared up at the golden branches of her juniper tree, ignoring what her brother had said. \"My concern is that he'll discover Bella's attempts at stealing his job.\" Matthew shook his head. \"She doesn't know she's doing that.\" \"I know she doesn't. But he doesn't know that she doesn't know.\" Matthew tried to make sense of what she'd just said before continuing. \"So what do we do about it?\" \"For right now, leave them be. I've seen the future, Matthew. Things will turn out. They will become good friends in time. I just wish I could tell everyone else…\" \"You know you can't do that. It'll just give them false hopes. Empty promises. Because…\" \"…my visions aren't always correct,\" Juniper finished for him. \"Or they don't explain the whole picture. That's the curse that comes with the power, I suppose.\" \"Are you kidding me? Juni, you're the best Seer of the Beyond we've ever had.\" Juniper gave a sad smile. \"She's very feisty…full of energy.\" \"What?\" \"Bella, I mean. She's a lively one. It's a shame she's trapped.\" \"What do you mean, trapped?\" \"She wants to help Max, but she's unable to. Just like I'd like to visit the other places in Max's Mind, but I'm forced to stay here.\" Matthew closed his eyes. \"Juni, not this again.\" \"Matt, you're sure they won't let me out? You know they have me trapped in this meadow.\" \"I can try to ask again, but I don't think it'll work. They don't like the Seer to leave her position for fear that she'll tell everyone of her visions.\" \"Well, then. You should tell Bella that she'll be successful.\" \"In what way?\" Matthew asked. \"I'm not sure. But I have seen that she will go far.\" \"Juni?\" \"Matt, she'll go far,\" Juniper repeated, lost in her vision. \"The question is…how far?\"[Chapter 8] Chapter Six: The Super Wolf and the Warrior Bella was walking through a meadow a few days later, trying to let her mind wander away from Max and his situation. She didn't like the helpless feeling she had when he talked about his mom and dad and sisters. A twig snapped. Bella's vampire instincts kicked in as she whirled around, looking for the source of the noise. There appeared to be nothing there, but her vampire senses were going into overdrive, the way they usually did when John or one of his cronies would try to pull a sneak attack on her. She sniffed. The scent was definitely not a vampire. It was a mixture of the smell Max gave off and the scent of a dog, or whatever it was Max was so fascinated with. She walked on, but kept herself alert. She sensed scrambling behind her. She squared her shoulders and pretended not to notice anything. It was better if whoever was stalking her thought she was unaware of them so she could catch them by surprise at the last moment. Then came the running. The pad, pad, pad of feet through the grass and flowers. Bella couldn't fight her curiosity and decided to turn around earlier than she planned. She needed to see what this strange creature looked like before she did anything. She was sure her mind was playing tricks on her. This creature had to be a figment of some crazy dream. Barreling towards her was something she didn't know even existed, let alone lived in the same world she did. It looked to be a wolf – a white one, with large, sharp ears and long, wiry whiskers. But as it drew closer, Bella could see that this thing was also a human. At least the face part was. Its hair was a dark brown, as were its eyes, and its mouth was curled in a snarl. It came closer still. She could now tell that it was wearing a suit of sorts, which explained why it smelled like a dog-wolf-thing. It was actually a human, like Max. She figured that she should start running, but for some reason, she didn't want to give chase to this thing. She was interested in what it was, and wanted to ask it questions. So she stayed put. When it finally realized she wasn't running away, it stopped, but continued to growl. It hunched over, like vampires did when they were being defensive. \"Are you the one they call Bella the Vampire?\" Bella nodded. \"Yes. That's me,\" she said politely. It wasn't having an effect on the creature. It didn't move an inch. \"I've been informed that you've been helping Max with his…family problems.\" \"I've been trying,\" Bella explained, saddened by the mention of the subject. \"But every time I try to tell him what I think he should do, he doesn't hear me. It's like there's some sort of whooshing in his ears.\" The creature's growl deepened. \"That's because there is a whooshing in his ears! He cannot take advice from anyone in his Brain other than his Conscience.\" \"Oh…what's a Conscience?\" The creature shook its head. \"It's the voice that tells Max what's good and bad, you ridiculous girl! It guides him in the right direction! That's why he doesn't hear you when you talk about that stuff. You're not his Conscience.\" \"Oh. That makes sense.\" Bella frowned. \"Well, then…who is his Conscience?\" The creature straightened itself proudly. \"I am.\" Bella stared at the thing. It looked no older than Max himself. This thing kind of looked like Max, too, now that she thought of it… \"You? But…you're so young.\" \"What's that got to do with anything?\" the thing asked angrily. \"I was made from Max's image. I know what's best for him.\" Bella nodded, understanding. \"That's really neat.\" The thing didn't seem satisfied. If anything, it seemed to be angrier than before. \"It's my job, and my job alone. What I don't get is why you , a Character of sorts, would try to steal it.\" \"What?\" Bella took a step backward. \"Why would I do that?\" \"You've been trying to tell Max what to do for a while now,\" the thing said. \"And that's supposed to be my task. If I were you, I'd back off pretty fast.\" A shock of fear went through her. \"Why?\" \"I'm half-wolf,\" he said, his voice growing into a growl. \"And when I'm angry…you don't wanna stick around.\" He crouched lower, his teeth bared. Bella didn't know what to do. Her vampire instincts were telling her to fight back, to teach this little twerp a lesson. The regular part of her was screaming at her to hightail it out, or otherwise she'd be in some deep water. Her feet refused to move, grounding her where she was. \"What part of leaving don't you understand?\" the boy-wolf-thing asked her. \"I don't want to hurt you. That's why you'd better get out of here. When I get angry, I'm not always able to control my outbursts.\" Feet. Move. Now. Nothing. She closed her eyes, waiting for the imminent pain. \"Unhand that lady, foul beast!\" came a cry from the other side of the meadow. Bella turned to see a boy with black hair standing with a sharp object in his hand. He ran toward them, looking ready to take on anything. She found herself unable to look away. The boy slowed when he reached them. \"Max! What are you doing here?\" he asked, putting the sharp thing in his belt. The wolf stood up and faced the boy, clearly annoyed. \"Trying to take care of things, Chris,\" he said, trying to maintain his composure. \"I finally found out who was stealing my job.\" He pointed at Bella. The boy frowned. \"This is the 'horrible monster' you were talking about?\" Bella's eyes widened. Is that what this \"Max\" had called her? \"Yes.\" Max stamped his foot. \"And I was almost ready to tear her to shreds when you showed up and ruined everything!\" he whined. The boy rolled his eyes. \"Max, you're only, what, three?\" \"And-a-half!\" he added. \"Believe me, I was ready to do some hard-core fighting.\" \"I'm sure.\" \"This from Mr. Dramatics?\" The wolf-boy deepened his voice, imitating his friend. \"'Unhand that lady, foul beast!' Where did that come from?\" \"Touché.\" The boy suddenly turned his piercing blue eyes on her, and her breath caught in her throat. \"Sorry if he was giving you trouble. Max can overact sometimes.\" \"Hey! So do you!\" \"I'm well aware of that.\" The boy stuck out his hand. \"I'm Christian. I'm a Warrior.\" Bella took his hand, feeling a tingle up her arm. \"Warrior?\" The word was strange to her. It sounded dangerous and exciting at the same time. \"Yes. We train for battle, in case there is any need for it.\" His eyebrows knitted together. \"And you must be a vampire, am I right?\" She nodded, unable to say anything. Her heart was going faster than it usually did, but she didn't know why. \"Well, it's custom that Warriors and Vampires hate each other. Surely you know that.\" \"Right.\" She didn't know that. She was disappointed. This boy seemed very interesting. \"But you're nothing like what the other Warriors say about the Vampires,\" Chris said quickly. \"I've never seen one up close before. The others tell me they're vicious and merciless.\" Bella was about to defend her kind when Chris looked at her. Really looked at her. \"But…not you.\" She felt a warm feeling in her face. \"Thank you.\" Chris turned to the wolf. \"Max?\" \"What?\" \"I think you have something to say to…?\" \"Bella,\" Bella said. \"Yes…Bella.\" The thing called Max came forward and hung his head. \"Sorry I was mean,\" he said in monotone, clearly not the least bit sorry. Chris ruffled Max's ears. \"That wasn't so hard, was it?\" Max growled and said nothing. \"Okay, then.\" Chris suddenly became uncomfortable. \"I'll just…um…leave, then.\" \"Really?\" Bella asked, a bit disappointed. \"I was training when I got a message that someone was in trouble.\" He gave a pointed look at Max. \"My little friend sets off our alarms very easily.\" \"Alarms?\" \"Well, that's how we know when someone needs our help. That's the other thing we do. We rescue those in need.\" \"That's…\" Bella wanted to say a hundred great things right then. But she never said a single one. \"Bella!\" Mahree and Dan came running up to her. \"Hi, guys,\" she said. \"Is everything okay?\" Mahree asked, concerned. She took notice of Max and Chris for the first time, and immediately went into vampire mode. \"Are you sure you're alright?\" \"I'm fine…\" Bella assured her friend. \"What are you doing here?\" Dan inquired Chris. Bella saw that Dan was also looking very defensive. \"I'm on duty,\" Chris informed them coldly. \"I was sent to save your friend Bella from…Max.\" He gestured to the boy in the wolf suit, who was now content chasing a butterfly. Mahree and Dan exchanged looks before looking at Bella. \"You're sure he didn't try anything funny?\" they asked. \"No, of course not,\" Bella said. \"Why would he?\" \"Vampire and Warriors don't really get along,\" Dan explained. \"I figured…\" Bella said flatly. \"But why?\" \"A sense of pride,\" Mahree told her. \"We're both very powerful species of Characters.\" \"You mean…you guys fight just because each group thinks it's stronger than the other?\" Dan nodded. \"Something like that.\" \"Well…what's wrong with Max?\" \"Guilty by association,\" Dan said. \"It's ridiculous, really,\" Chris admitted. \"I really don't like the rules, but…\" \"You Warriors think you can bend the rules, do you?\" Mahree sneered. \"If you think you're so tough, why don't I just go and let Matthew know you were bothering us…?\" Chris got the message. \"I was just leaving, anyway. Come on, Max.\" He looked right at Bella. \"I'm glad you're safe now.\" Max waved begrudgingly before trailing after him. \"Let's go, Bella,\" Dan said. \"You shouldn't be out by yourself around here.\" Bella hardly heard him. Mahree noticed her friend seemed a bit spacey. \"She's probably still shocked. Just give her a little time to calm down.\" In truth, she was shocked. But not because of the reasons Mahree thought. Those words would ring in her head for a very long time: \"I'm glad you're safe now.\" Bella didn't know it yet, but what had happened in the meadow was going to spark a chain of events that would change everything. ","Summary":" Hey, everyone! LOL I know this isn't a very bright idea, making a new story since I've got two othe"},{"Movie":"Good Witch","Title":"Gray Days","Author":"Swftrain","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12770616","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Short Story: Gray Days *Disclaimer: I don't own anything, least of all Good Witch. Just playing for my own sake The house was quiet. It was the first thing Grace noticed as she rolled over in bed. Her clock read 7:15. While that was still early for most people on a Saturday morning, it was unusual not to hear her mother in the kitchen. Grace spared half a thought that maybe her mother was outside with Sam instead of in the kitchen. That scenario had recently begun to be as familiar and comfortable as her right arm. So, without another thought she crawled out of bed and began to head downstairs. Halfway down the hall something made her pause. She slowly turned and looked at her Mothers closed bedroom door. An uneasy feeling was crawling its way into her chest. Ok, Mom's door is closed, she thought. Unusual, but not unheard of, especially after the insanity that this week had brought. But still, maybe her door was just closed. She was probably outside with Sam or in the living room reading, or potting plants in the alcove. That had to be it. But as she crept down the stairs the feeling of unease intensified. It was eerily quiet in both the living room and the alcove. The kitchen held the same result as the sinking feeling grew into a fully blossomed pit in her stomach. Everything looked as it had last night when they went to bed. Laying her hands on the kitchen counter Grace closed her eyes and tried to sense her mother. Nothing. No happiness radiating from outside or any other part of the house. The only thing she could pick up on was a heavy ache suspiciously coming from the upstairs family bedrooms. Opening her eyes and heaving a sigh, she set out to make tea, resigning herself that today might be a rare gray day. Honestly, now that she thought about it, she supposed it was only a matter of time. She had never really thought about how few days like this there were. As she grew older she began to recognize how well her mother hid her pain and grieved in silence, keeping her emotions hidden. Since her father had passed away, she had been so consumed by her own personal grief that she often forgot that Brandon, Lori, and especially her mom, had lost him too. They all had bad days missing him, but whenever it was any of the kids her mother always knew how to help, be it in silent support, a hug, or sharing happy memories. But when her mom showed her grief it came in the form of a haunted and blank stare or a sad smile. It was very rare for her mother to let her emotions be visible to anyone for more than a minute. As the months and years had passed, Grace, Brandon, and Lori were private witnesses to a few rare occasions when Cassie let her grief shine through. They referred to these as gray days, the days when the grief and longing latched on and was unforgiving. \"You're the only one down here? Mom's door is still closed.\" Grace glanced up as Lori wandered in the kitchen. \"Have you seen or heard her this morning?\" Grace shook her head and sighed. \"I am afraid today might be a gray day\" Lori sighed too as she leaned a hip on the counter watching Grace make a pot of tea. \"We were probably due, especially after this week. It's been a long time since we've had a gray day\" \"Yes it has\" Grace agreed. \"We probably should text the others as a heads up\" Lori silently nodded and picked up her phone, sending out a quick coded text to those in the \"need to know\" circle, knowing everyone would respond quickly and do what needed to be done on a gray day. Grace strained the tea she had been brewing and began to prepare a tray to take upstairs. Unsure what, if anything, her mother would want to eat this morning. \"I don't think she is going to want to eat yet Grace\" Lori said as she watched Grace search for something to put on the tray. Lori's phone chirped with several responses, Abigail would mind the store, Stephanie would make lunch and dinner and deliver them this afternoon, and Brandon and Tara would be over in an hour. All essential gray day members reported in, taking on the duties necessary to get through today. Lori fiddled with her phone and glanced at Grace. \"Should we tell Sam?\" It made Grace pause. Her mother's relationship with Sam was complicated for several reasons and she honestly didn't know how to respond. Would her mother want Sam to see her in her grief for her deceased husband? They have been dating quite a while now but Sam had never been privy to a gray day. And before today, he hadn't been considered part of the \"need to know\" circle that came with this particular family pain. Lori watched Grace as she stilled her movements. Lori knew this might be challenging and she also, honestly, didn't know what to do. Though gray days were rare, they had been happening for years now and they had a system. Sam added a new cog to the machine, a different dynamic, and she wasn't sure of the outcome. But as usual, fate had plans unbeknownst to them as Sam stepped through the back door at that moment. \"Good morning girls! It's a beautiful crisp morning out there! Where's your mother? I figured she'd be half way through her daily chores by now\" The girls shared a look and neither spoke. Resting her hands on the counter and sighing a little, Grace looked up at Sam and gathered as much courage as she could. \"Sam.\" She paused to glance at Lori. \"Sam\" she tried again. She didn't know what to say. Thankfully Sam picked up on her unease. \"Is everything ok? You guys look like something is wrong\" \"No we are ok. Everything is ok\" Lori answered \"Its just going to be a difficult day I think\" she said gently \"mom isn't up yet.\" Sam glanced between the two girls again. They didn't look panicked but there was pain. He'd never known Cassie to sleep in. She was up with the sun everyday without fail. \"Anything I can do?\" he asked quietly, unsure of the issue but if Cassie wasn't out of bed, something was indeed wrong \"Is she ok? Is she sick? I can take a look at her.\" \"No, no\" Grace shook her head, \"she's not sick. She's ok. Kinda.\" She glanced at Lori, \"its just a gray day. She will be ok.\" she repeated. Sam kept quiet and just observed the girls. She wasn't sick but something was up. \"Are you sure she's ok?\" \"She will be\" Grace repeated, \"I'm going to take her some tea and she'll need a few hours but she will be ok.\" Grace picked up the two mugs of tea she poured, \"check in this afternoon Sam, something tells me she'll be ready by then.\" She gave him a slightly watery but gentle smile. \"I'll call Brandon and Tara. It might be a photo album kind of day,\" Lori offered, \"I'll get them caught up and be up in a few.\" Grace nodded and turned to head upstairs. \"Lori?\" Sam questioned quietly. Lori shook her head, \"She's not sick Sam but I don't think she is ready to see you yet today. Maybe by this afternoon\" Sam began to feel uneasy. Not ready to see him? Did he do something? \"Did I do something? Is it me?\" Lori shifted her weight, \"you didn't do anything and its not you directly but it is related to you.\" She paused, \"just give her a few hours. Like Grace said, maybe by this afternoon she'll be ready. Just,\" she smiled, \"give her a little time and space. It'll be ok Sam. I absolutely promise.\" Sam didn't know entirely what to do. The girls were being quite cryptic and though something seemed to be really wrong, that apparently may have something to do with him, it didn't seem as though the girls were willing to let him see Cassie to find out. And they seemed to have it handled; he could be patient he guessed. He took a breath, \"ok. Well I guess give her a kiss from me and I'll check back in later. But Lori, please call me if you, or she, needs me. I'll just be at home\" he turned and headed out the back door with one glance over his shoulder. Lori watched him go, a small smile on her face. They were lucky, she thought. Their family was close and they supported each other through everything, no matter what. And she knew Sam was close to being a full time member, already ready to support in any way he could. She sighed and began to fix breakfast for George and the guests, waiting a few minutes to call Brandon and update him on the plan for the day. Today was a gray day, but that was ok. They loved and supported each other and Sam, their new element, might just make this gray day easier. Grace gently padded up the stairs, concentrating on not spilling the tea in her mugs. Just as she reached the landing George came out of his room and stopped mid stride. Silently he noted the two mugs of tea, her direction of travel, and Cassie's closed bedroom door. His face fell immediately and he stepped forward to press a kiss to Grace's temple, \"gray day?\" he asked. Grace nodded; she knew Lori would fill him in when he got downstairs. Giving her cheek a gentle pat he turned toward Cassie's door, \"Give her a kiss for me\" he whispered as he opened the door for Grace. Grace nodded quietly and stepped into the master bedroom as George pulled the door shut behind her. Her mother, her beautiful, strong, independent, loving, extraordinary mother, lay on her side in the middle of the bed, curled into a pillow, wearing her father's old college sweatshirt. Normally she was the sunshine in every room, the brightest star wherever she went. While she still radiated light and love today there was a large gray energy encompassing the entire room. She was awake, Grace knew that, but Cassie didn't stir. Quietly Grace padded across the room and placed the mugs of tea on the nightstand. She turned toward the bed to see her Mother's deep brown eyes watching her. \"It's a gray day momma\" Grace whispered as she pulled back the covers and slid into the bed, snuggling right up to face her mom, giving her two quick kisses on the cheek murmuring \"from me and grandpa.\" She gazed into her mother's eyes and gave her two more quick kisses, \"from daddy\" she paused and took a chance, \"and Sam.\" Lying nose to nose with her daughter Cassie closed her eyes and sighed. Grace thought she heard her mother mutter, \"my baby\" before she slowly slid her arm around her daughter, pulling her to her chest. Grace closed her eyes and relaxed in her mothers arm, content in her presence. Today was a gray day, but the sun would come out later, she just knew it.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: George quietly entered the kitchen seeing Lori working on breakfast and speaking on the phone, it seemed, to her brother. \"Yes Brandon. Yes that sounds good. Could you please ask Tara to bring those albums too? It might be an album day. I'll probably already be upstairs but just check in with Grandpa when you get here. Ok, see you guys in a bit.\" Lori hung up the phone and glanced at George as he settled into a bar stool. \"I saw Grace upstairs with tea,\" he reported, watching Lori. Lori nodded in comprehension. \"Yeah, a gray day it is\" \"Honestly she's probably been due for quite a while but I'm not surprised this week put her over the edge\" He picked up a piece of toast Lori had placed on his plate. Lori paused for a minute and looked at George, \"Sam came in a few minutes ago looking for her.\" George paused the toast halfway to his mouth, \"what happened? What did you tell him?\" George said, knowing this could be complicated. \"Grace and I told him she was ok but would need a few hours before he could see her. He was concerned but seemed to understand, said to call if we needed anything.\" George nodded, Sam is a good guy he knew, Cassie had been really happy since they started dating. He is hoping this gray day doesn't derail anyone. \"Grandpa, can you finish breakfast for the guests? Brandon and Tara are coming over in a bit. I told them to check in with you. Maybe send some food up with them? Maybe she'll be up to eating something by then.\" \"Sure honey, no problem. Go be with your mom\" George nodded, and stood to take over the eggs Lori had started in the pan. Lori smiled, handed over the spatula, gave George a kiss on the cheek, grabbed a book, and headed upstairs to join her sister and her mother. The room was quiet; she didn't hear any voices coming from Cassie's room as she approached. Gently she eased the door open and was greeted by the sight of her sister and her mother snuggled into Cassie's bed, both eyes closed, just relishing in the comfort of one another. Lori stepped into the room and felt her heart ache, filled with love for her family. Cassie opened her eyes and silently watched Lori as she walked over to, and climbed into bed behind Cassie. Lori leaned over Cassie and gave her two quick kisses on her cheek, \"from me and daddy\" she paused, glanced at Grace, added one more quick kiss, \"and Sam\". She settled into bed with the girls, sitting up against the headboard with her right side pressed against Cassie's back. She cracked the book she had brought and brushed a hand over her mother's head. Though Cassie wasn't her biological mother, she'd been her mother in all the ways that count, plus a thousand more, for more years that she could count. When she brought Cassie home to her father, she had known this woman would mean more than anything to her. And she had never let her down. Life isn't fair, there is great devastating pain but also great and devastating love and Lori always felt that on gray days, she felt more great and devastating love. It brought them all together to relish in each other and their happy and sad memories. She felt a hitch in Cassie's breathing and watched a tear track down her cheek, \"Momma\" she breathed. She leaned down and pressed one more lingering kiss to her mother and lightly smoothed out the wrinkles on her forehead. Slowly she sat back up, opened to one of her favorites and spoke aloud, \"Our light reading today brought to you by Walt Whitman. Our favorites.\" She glanced at Grace and Cassie, offered a smile to a grinning Grace, and saw the tiniest of smiles begin on Cassie's face. Content with her choice she began to read aloud. Today is a gray day, but the sun would shine soon, Lori just knew it.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Brandon opened the front door, carrying a box of albums in his arms while Tara brought in a large bouquet of flowers, fresh from Abigail's shop. George was still in the kitchen, washing dishes and putting away left overs from breakfast with the guests. Luckily the groups of guests were quiet and relaxed, no one was high maintenance right now. He wasn't sure they could all handle any of that today. \"Hey Grandpa\" Brandon placed the box of albums on the counter. \"Hey Brandon, Tara. Do you need a vase?\" George asked Tara as she opened the paper wrapping on the flowers. \"Yes I do, thanks. I was thinking the large purple one we normally use at Easter\" Tara replied. \"How's everything going Grandpa? Have the girls been back down at all? Has mom been down?\" Brandon asked, trying to get the lay of the land on how the gray day has been progressing. George glanced up, \"No unfortunately. Both the girls went up and have not returned. Cassie hasn't been down at all this morning. Lori took the Walt Whitman book up with her when she went but she asked me to send up some snacks with you when you go in. Maybe you can get your mother to eat something\" Brandon just nodded; he hated gray days. He felt so helpless, and he would do anything to fix it. Usually the girls did a better job than he did in comforting Cassie but he tried to support as much as he could. \"Any ideas on food?\" \"Well Cassie did make cinnamon rolls yesterday but I thought that might not be a good idea. So maybe just some fruit and cheese\" Brandon watched his Grandfather pull out a plate he had started preparing. Yeah, Cinnamon rolls weren't a good idea being Dad's favorite and all. No point in rubbing salt in a wound. \"I think I might just stay down here a while and help George with the guests and cleaning the kitchen\" Tara stated as she arranged the flowers in the purple vase. She glanced knowingly between both men; sometimes gray days meant Cassie just needed time with her kids. Brandon just nodded. \"Ok, I'll try and get her to eat something and I'll take the box of albums with me\" Gathering up the box and balancing the plate on top he took a deep breath and headed upstairs. He expected to hear Lori reading Whitman when he approached the room, but everything was quiet. Wondering the state of his family he balanced the box and reached for the handle. Luckily the box wasn't too heavy and he was able to open the door on his own, and as he did he was greeted to the sight of his mother and two sisters curled together in the bed. It didn't look as though Grace or Cassie had moved in quite some time and Lori was sitting up a little further, draped across the pillows just above their heads, her arm resting on Cassie's exposed upper arm and shoulder. Whitman was still open, resting on Lori's lap, clearly having been abandoned in favor of a snuggling nap. As he entered the room all 3 pairs of eyes watched him. He met Grace's eyes and mouthed, \"has she spoken at all?\" and thought he saw the slightest shake of her head. Regardless the expression in all their eyes told him the answer was no. Ok. It was an album day, he was glad he brought those. He set the box down on the rocking chair and approached the bed. \"Momma\" he whispered as he leaned over Cassie and gave her two kisses, \"for me and Tara\". She reached up and hugged him tightly. \"Thank you. I love you\" Cassie whispered, and internally all three kids smiled. The darkness seemed to be breaking and Brandon clearly understood that his sisters had done some magic up until now. Standing back up he returned to the plate and box on the rocking chair. \"I brought up a plate of cheese and fruit when you decide to eat something.\" Reaching into the box he pulled out one album and handed it to Lori, who, sitting up, gratefully accepted it. Making himself comfortable he pulled the chair closer to the bed and sat down, kicking his feet up onto the bed. Leaning back he closed his eyes for a minute, sighing and just revealing in the strength of not only his mother, but his sisters as well. He had much of the same thought process as Lori when it came to Cassie. She was not his biological mother but she was his mother in all the ways that count. And always had been. She was the only mother that he remembered really. Since he and Lori had lost their mother when they were little, and then losing their father, their step-mother and Grandfather are the only ones left. And she was the strongest person he knew, which made the gray days so devastating. Rubbing his hands over his face he opened his eyes again to see all three women still watching him. No one spoke as he reached into the box for his own album and Lori opened hers to begin flipping through it. Quietly Cassie closed her eyes again and both he and Lori lost themselves in childhood memories while Grace just stay snuggled up with her mother and watched everyone. Everyone just absorbed the comfort of each other for at least the next 30 minutes. Lori and Brandon traded photo albums while Grace and Cassie stayed snuggled together. Grace could tell her mother was warming, light was returning, sometimes all it took was the comfort of each other. Cassie shifted a little and let her eyes travel slowly between all three kids, keeping a light but reassuring hand on both Grace and Lori. Suddenly Lori bust out laughing, \"Oh my goodness! I completely forgot about this photo! Oh my gosh!\" She looked up quickly to Brandon. \"This was when we had that mud fight because you had slipped into the mud pile and I laughed, which you didn't think was funny, and threw a huge mud ball at me for it! I was COVERED in mud. Which of course lead to a full on mud war\" Lori turned the photo album around to show Brandon the photograph, which showed a sulking Brandon with Jake and Lori, everyone covered in mud, with faces of pure joy and mischief laughing loudly at the camera. \"I don't think the stains ever came out of that shirt,\" Brandon replied, \"that was my favorite shirt!\" Lori showed the photograph to Grace and Cassie. They had all seen these photographs several times before but Grace liked to hear the stories that went with them. \"Where were you mom?\" Cassie smiled a small smile and glanced at Lori. \"She was taking the picture\" Lori replied, \"she was pregnant with you and did NOT want to be involved in the mud fight. I think she got most of the stains out of all our shirts but those clothes forever became out muddy outdoor clothes.\" \"Everyone looks so happy\" Grace mused and Cassie's smile grew just a little bit bigger, nodding her head in agreement. \"Do you want an album mom?\" asked Brandon. Secretly he hoped she did, active participation was always better than passively listening. Cassie's eyes guarded a bit, but she shook her head yes with a small nod and soft smile. \"Here! This is the album with Grace's baby pictures in it. You guys can share that one.\" After a little shifting, both Cassie and Grace sat up against the headboard, all three girls still snuggled together, but with two photo albums between them now. Quietly they all continued to flip through the albums, each smiling to themselves. A quiet laugh escaped Cassie as she turned the page. \"Is that me?\" Grace laughed \"what is that face?!\" The photograph depicts a baby Grace bawling, a young Brandon with a horrified expression and Jake with a very amused laughter face in the background. Cassie nodded, \"It is. You were not happy because you wanted your diaper changed and Brandon tried to calm you down, but I think he caught a whif. You can see your father in the background laughing.\" \"Ok you had really smelly diapers Grace\" Brandon defended himself. Cassie smiled, \"so did you Brandon.\" \"Ha!\" Grace laughed and smiled. The spell was broken and they all felt it. Cassie spoke freely about this photo for the first time in hours and they all knew the corner was turned. \"Guys\" Cassie started glancing at all her children. She paused, looking down into her lap, trying to find the words. She hated these gray days too, especially as she couldn't help needing her children around. They were debilitating and, some would consider humiliating to need people around to help, but mostly they just felt draining. \"We love you mom. More than anything and you are the strongest person we know.\" Grace started as she laid her head on her mother's shoulder. \"Yeah Mom, I mean we lean on you for everything. Absolutely everything, you help us literally every day. To need a day of quiet lay-in surrounded by your loving and wonderful children? There's no shame in that\" Lori added. Brandon just smiled and shook his head. \"I don't know where we'd be without you\" Cassie just shook her head. She had the best children in the world. There wasn't really anything she could say, but she needed to try. \"I love you guys. You are my life. I just,\" she let out a quiet laugh, \"I miss your father I guess.\" She sniffled and wiped her eyes. \"So do we Mom. Every day.\" Grace paused, unsure if she should continue, \"Mom.\" She glanced at Lori, \"Sam came by this morning and found Lori and I in the kitchen. We kind of had to explain, vaguely, you weren't available.\" Cassie sighed. She knew not only that this day would come, but also that she owed both her kids and Sam an explanation. She fiddled with her hands in her lap. How was this so difficult when love should be easy? When she looked up she noticed all of her kids just sitting, and watching her. They always knew how to make her feel better, cheer her up. It didn't make the ache go away and she still missed Jake more than she could possibly explain. How do you tell your children that you love another man while still loving and missing their father? How does it all feel ok to love both men with your entire heart? How does it not feel like betrayal of someone? And how do you not only explain that to yourself, but to your children too? Grace smiled, watching her mother struggle. \"Mom.\" She looked at her siblings, \"We know you love Sam. Heck WE love Sam\" Brandon and Lori both nodded eagerly. \"I'd think Dad would love Sam too\". She smiled, \"for many reasons but mostly because he makes you happy.\" Cassie looked at Grace with awe. She knew she passed her gift to her daughter but sometimes it really did un-nerve her how much she has grown in it. She quickly glanced at Brandon and Lori, both wearing large encouraging smiles. \"You deserve it more than anyone mom\" Lori said, \"loving Sam doesn't mean you love Dad any less. Please don't ever think we think that either.\" \"You've been happy Mom. I mean you are happy, you have lead a really fulfilling life. But you've lit up even more in the past year with Sam. Something we haven't seen since Dad. But Mom, YOU are our person. The most important in the world to us, and we want you happy. Dad knows that, we know that, you just have to believe that too\" Brandon shrugged Cassie glanced around at her children. Her wonderful, beautiful, loving children, all of whom she has because of Jake. Brandon and Lori are perfect examples that family is what you make of people you love, whether you are related to them or not. Cassie ran her fingers along Grace's cheek, then Lori's, nodded in acceptance, and pulled the girls tight against her. Brandon smiled, watching from his perch in the rocking chair. \"Feel up to eating anything?\" he approached hesitantly. She turned her head, still resting on Grace's, to gaze at him. Her eyes were filled with such love he tried to show his back as best as he could. \"Maybe later. But I'd like to head downstairs I think. Go outside\" Brandon nodded his head, not surprised. Outside in the air, near her plants, was where she connected best. \"We'll go make you some more hot tea to take outside,\" he said as he stood to gather the mugs of tea from the night stand. He stooped to kiss her head and gently nudge Grace, \"Let her get dressed Grace. We'll meet you downstairs.\" Reluctantly Cassie released her girls, watched her children stack the albums in the box, and head downstairs, leaving her alone in her room once again. Sighing she eased out of bed and went to her closet to find something comfortable but appropriate to replace her pajamas. She needed to figure this out, how to release herself from the guilt in her heart. And she owed Sam an explanation. She needed to go outside, she'd think better there and could clear her head and heart. George and Tara watched the three children enter the kitchen quietly. It was about noon, George thought they must've done a pretty good job to be down here by noon. George held out his arms to Lori and she walked right in, giving him a big hug. \"She loves you guys more than anything. You guys did her good this morning. She ok?\" He gently probed, running a hand down Lori's back. Lori sighed and kept quiet. It was Grace who answered. \"I think so. She's struggling. She didn't talk at all for the first few hours. I think she's trying to figure out how to love them both. And make sure we're ok too,\" she sighed. \"I don't know how to help her,\" Lori muffled in George's shirt. \"I just want her to be happy. Dad wants her to be happy.\" She heard a sniffle and turned her head. Cassie stood at the bottom of the steps wiping her eyes. She stepped to Grace and ran her hand along her back, looking at all her family members. \"I'm working on it. I promise. I'll figure it out,\" she sighed. \"Momma,\" Grace started, \"You love him. Don't lose him\" Cassie nodded. \"We'll bring you tea outside if you want to go out.\" Brandon said gently Cassie ran her hand down Grace's hair once more, leaned down and gave her a kiss, and grabbed her coat, heading outside looking for her favorite spot. The leaves crunched under her boots and she zipped the sides of her coat together against the chilly, crisp breeze. She took a deep breath and let the air fill her lungs and drag the dark ache out. The breeze picked up and tossed her hair around her face, lifting her spirits and smoothing the wrinkles. She never doubted her connection to nature but in these times it was a balm like nothing else. She knew he'd come, not immediately, but soon. She was ready but would soak up the silence and solace, easing into her peace as smoothly as she could. The energy around her sparkled and sparked and she finally felt the blue hues of forgiveness, acceptance, and love, for herself. She knew she could love Jake with her entire heart for the rest of her life, because he had given her life purpose and family, and home. He had loved her first like no one had before, and that was never something that would leave her. She walked into life with Jake like an explosion, diving in head first. Love with Sam was different; more of a slow wading into the water with all of her baggage, until she was submerged, eyes wide open. She could love and respect and pay tribute to Jake through her children, their children, and grow into a life with Sam as the person she is now. A person created out of the life she'd had with Jake. He'd be there everyday, just as he had been, supporting her and pushing her to be better. She felt him enter the garden and a small smile graced her face. She could feel his hesitation overshadowing his confidence, and she waited. He eased onto the bench next to her, resting one hand on her back, and gently sliding his other hand into hers, not saying a word. She kept her eyes closed as they leaned together, soaking up the presence of the other. Feeling the calm and clarity wash over her she turned her face to his and pressed a kiss to his lips, smiling as he kissed her back. \"Are you ready?\" He asked. She nodded. She was. She was facing forward, eyes wide open, stepping into the next stage of her life, carrying her past with her. Inside Grace leaned against the counter and watched her mom and Sam from the window. She felt it, her mom had passed into a new stage and happiness flowed fully from the garden. She couldn't help the giant smile that graced her face. They were ready. The past was not forgotten, it was celebrated, into all stages of life. That didn't mean there wouldn't be gray days, but the sun was shining. They had a new \"need to know\" circle member. One that would stay. They didn't say much, just leaned together relishing in the cool breeze and the company. Sam had done some thinking this morning after he left Grey House. He knew Cassie was working up to talking so he kept silent, giving her time and space. But he thinks he has an idea of what set her off. This week was tough, he knew that, everyone was tired and as usual, Cassie gave more of herself than anyone.[Chapter 4] Lori walked into the kitchen, joining Grace at the counter, watching Cassie and Sam in the Garden through the giant window over the sink. They were leaned together on the bench in Cassie's favorite spot. \"They are going to be ok,\" Lori commented. Grace just nodded. This was all so complicated; she understood that. Lori and Brandon probably understood it better than she did, Lord knows she's still struggling. She's only ever known her mom with her dad. Lori and Brandon knew their parents, then accepted Cassie into their lives to be with their dad, and now only have Cassie, and trying to let Sam into their lives. Grace likes Sam, she really does, but she also understands her mom's struggle, partially, from a different perspective of course. \"How did you do it?\" Grace asked, bumping Lori's shoulder. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean losing your mom, gaining my mom, losing dad, gaining Sam…how do you handle accepting someone new into such an important position in your life without feeling like you're replacing someone.\" Lori sighed, turning to sit at the table, Grace following her, leaving Cassie and Sam sitting together in the garden without an audience. \"I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Sam, and I think he is great for mom, but,\" Grace shrugged, unable to say it. \"He isn't dad\" Lori finished. \"Right\" \"Honestly I don't know; other than I never, ever, thought of them as replacing someone. I loved your mom from the moment I met her. She wasn't like anyone I had ever met and she just drew me in. I gravitated toward her and she supported and loved me and never let me down. That's really all I thought about. I mean the moment I met her she was saving me from an angry dog and patching up my busted knee. She wasn't replacing my mom, just adding a parental love to my life in any way I needed. But after a while, she'd been in my life for so many years she really has been my mom. I just got two mom's I guess. And I couldn't have needed her more than when we lost dad. But I never ever questioned that she would continue to be my parent, no matter what. I guess I just think of it as adding a loving and guiding soul, and trying to feel lucky to have the opportunity to love and learn from so many different people.\" Grace nodded, it was probably the best way anyone could explain it. She was shaped by the love and loss in their family, but would continue to grow with the love of others, without forgetting who they came from. \"Thanks Lori. I guess that's how I already think of him, as my adult friend and a great partner for mom. But after this morning I was thinking if they got married he'd be my step dad\" she shrugged, \"and then the word dad felt really weird.\" Lori nodded, \"yeah it is strange, but I think that's why I think Cassie grew into the role of my mom. I was younger than you though and needed a mother and she loved me unconditionally so I think it was inevitable. I think I will see Sam differently than that, more of a partner for mom instead of a dad. But still as someone who loves us and would do anything for us in this complicated and unruly world.\" Grace nodded. She understood why Cassie was struggling, figuring out roles, relationships, and family positions in everyone's lives while respecting people lost from those roles. It wasn't about replacing love, it was about finding the right mindset to make the past and future merge in harmony. They heard the front door open with Tara and Brandon emerging a minute later with boxes and bags from the Bistro. \"Stephanie sent rations,\" Brandon stated, laying a box filled to the brim on the table. \"And this is just lunch.\" \"She said she's bringing dinner by later, just so we don't die of starvation,\" Tara added dropping her bags on the floor. \"How many people is she trying to feed?\" Grace exclaimed, standing and sorting through bags, shocked at the staggering amount of food she was finding. \"You know her, she cooks when she's stressed, and gray days are always stressful. Plus she can't be here yet so she's compensating, which I, for one, am going to take advantage of,\" Brandon said as he dug into every container Grace was opening. \"You'd think I didn't feed him at home.\" Brandon grinned through a mouth full of noodles and winked at Tara. \"Healthy appetite gives one energy for all sorts of activities my dear,\" he mused as she blushed, Grace and Lori exchanged a look and rolled their eyes. \"Anyone seen Mom since we left to get food?\" Brandon questioned, still munching on the contents of yet another container. Grace looked toward the kitchen window, \"She and Sam were quietly sitting on the bench outside about 15 minutes ago.\" Brandon paused, fork halfway to his mouth, \"Sam?\" he questioned, surprised Cassie was ready to talk already. This could be the fastest gray day they've had, record time actually. He glanced toward the kitchen door, streaks of sunlight filtered through the window pane but gray clouds were still hovering. Things weren't quite settled, the pot still stirred, was this the eye of the storm?[Chapter 5] First of all, THANK YOU, to everyone who has just read, or read and reviewed. I am not a writer by any means but this show and story line just wouldn't leave me alone. So I appreciate the support! Secondly, I seriously struggled with this chapter. I re-wrote it at least 10 times from different perspectives until I could get even remotely close to what I wanted. This isn't perfect, but its as close as I could get right now. Third, I am unsure if I am going to continue this story line. It was really only ever supposed to be a one-shot but somehow it morphed. I have other ideas on continuing chapters but they don't flow quite right yet so I don't know if they will make print. This story line is so out of character for many of the characters involved that I am now having difficulty bringing them back. Plus I'm working on two other stories for Good Witch that have grasped my attention. Fourth, I have only the utmost respect for everyone involved with Good Witch and though I wish I could also be part of that team, I am not. I am just playing with characters that have captured my attention. Thank you again. I hope you enjoy it at least a little. Without further adieu... Chapter 5 They'd been sitting together for at least 20 minutes, Sam thought. Neither of them had said much and that was okay with him. He was perfectly happy just to sit with her; he knew she would talk when she was ready. Cassie closed her eyes and leaned further into Sam as he slid his arm from around her back to her shoulders, pulling her in. He was such a solid human being, steady with silent support; she really did love him she thought. He and Jake were similar in many ways but different in just as many. \"Sam,\" Cassie started, lifting her head, brushing her nose against his neck to breathe in his very unique scent of coffee and bleach from sterilizing his office. She chuckled to herself, those two smells really shouldn't go together and yet they made something uniquely Sam. She supposed something like their relationship, they really shouldn't work, and yet they did, better than she could have imagined. Sam felt her chuckle and smiled. She was quiet, and struggling, he knew but she was here and very willing to lean on him and that was the best thing he could ask for. She started, trying to pull the words out from the fractures of her heart. She didn't need to explain, she knew that, it wasn't owing him that, but more that this may be one of the last pieces of her soul she had yet to bare and it was time, time for open arms, open hearts, and trust. Trust that with great love came great risk, risk in baring ones otherwise fiercely protected soul. Here we go. \"It would have been easier to sit around feeling bad, looking for people to blame and complain to, rehashing what I could have done to make things happen differently. Or what I would have done if I only realized before it happened. And I was angry, Sam. I was angry, devastated, and furious at the world. I had just lost my love, the first man to really understand and accept me for me in a world that hadn't been overly kind to me. I had just lost a man who represented a once-in-a-lifetime love and a piece of my heart died with him. But, I had my kids to take care of, my beautiful kids who had just lost their father. For Lori and Brandon this was the second parent to have died, how do I allow myself to feel the weight of losing Jake when the world was falling apart for my kids? I spent most of my days holding it together for them, working through my emotions by pouring everything I had into them. I grieved, I still grieve, mostly its hidden and inside my own heart and brain without an audience. Rarely it shows to the outside world, like today,\" She paused, sneaking a glance at their hands still lightly joined, feeling his body devoid of stress or tension, feeling concern and empathy projecting from him. \"Sometimes its something little that sets me off like seeing a sale on his shaving cream, or baking cinnamon rolls by myself in the morning hours before the sun comes up. No matter what Jake is with me, around me, here, with us, in so many ways. And I know I couldn't have gotten to this point without that. He is the first half of my journey, my first true love, the father of my children, he always will be. But Sam,\" She paused and shifted to face him, bringing a hand to cup his cheek, \"I love you. I love you with all my heart. And I've been struggling on how that makes sense, how I handle that, how to carry my past with Jake into my future, with you, both of you holding my heart in very different ways. To me you're similar, but,\" She laughed, \"But very, very different at the same time. And I guess I need you to know that. You are my future, my next journey and I'm ready for it. But I have baggage, and he comes with me.\" She took a breath glancing toward the house, she could feel Grace searching for her, alert to changes in Cassie's emotions, and tried to project a calm exterior to her daughter. She knew Grace wouldn't go for it, her daughter was as intuitive as she was and though she'd wait, she knew her daughter would come looking for her eventually. She looked back to Sam and started again, \"I am ready to take our next step, to move forward, it is what I want. But there will be days like this when he's around more than others, when I do wake up thinking about him, and I need to know you are ok with that. For my sake, for your sake, and our kids sake. I don't want to lose you Sam, and I,\" she paused, uncertain. Yes she decided, it was true, \"I am scared because I can't move forward without him and I don't want to move forward without you.\" She stopped abruptly, afraid she was saying too much but needing him to see her fear, understand her struggle and conflict. What Sam had said at the Tarynsville festival resonated with her, she did have a lot left in her journey yet to go and though she'd never walk it alone, I mean she did have 3 fabulous kids, eventually those kids would all be involved in their own lives and her journey would change again. Her kids were her life but at some point, she wanted more, she needed more, and she had more to give, hopefully to Sam. She was committed, albeit with baggage, she was laying herself bare, trusting him and taking a chance. Sam kissed her immediately, once, twice, three times, and rested his forehead on hers, waiting a minute to respond, gathering his thoughts. How does one express how much love he had for this woman while also expressing how ludicrous it was that she was afraid he'd leave? He would never walk away from Cassie Nightingale, ever. He smiled and couldn't help the chuckle that escaped his lips. God he loved her. He laughed again and could feel her tension rising. Pulling back quickly he grasped her face in his hands. \"No, No I'm sorry. This is not in the least bit funny but hell Cassie. I'm never leaving you, or us, or our kids. I'm here babe. To stay for every miraculous day, and every day we both want to run for the hills, when we're fighting about tea and medicine, and baseball, and history and everything in between. Its an absolutely absurd thought in my brain to think I'd walk away from this, or you. So absurd its funny. My life is with you, with us, I wouldn't know how to function otherwise. Ok funny isn't the right word,\" shaking his head he tried to readjust, he was getting off track. But she was blushing and had a small smile that not only told him she understood but the relief was evident on her face. \"It isn't fair Cassie. Life isn't in the least bit fair. You don't deserve it. You didn't see it coming. You didn't plan for it. You have so many feelings and frustrations you don't know what to do with, or if you want to do anything at all. I've never known loss like that and I hope I never will. And I can honestly say I don't know if I could've handled any of it with half as much grace as you. I can't promise its going to be easy, I'm sure there will be days when I get frustrated, or probably feel inadequate. We are both strong minded, red-blooded people who are passionate. But I can promise you that I will always trust you to know what you need, to find me if you need my support and to tell me when you need space. I promise to beg for forgiveness when I need it for doing something stupid and trust your intuition at all times. I love you Cassie, we both have our baggage, and lord knows you've dealt with mine in more ways than one. I'm here for you in any way you need. I know he's your past and honestly, I can only thank him for loving you as much as he did, for helping you find your home in Middleton, for Grace and Lori and Brandon, and for being apart of you. Because I love you Cassie. All of you. And he's apart of you. I just wish I could thank him for that.\" Cassie couldn't thank the universe enough for this dear, sweet, and very understanding man. A man who not only loved her, but loved her enough to see her grieve her husband years later and understand that it didn't diminish their own relationship, only strengthen it. And for that, she could only love him more. She closed her eyes for just a second, sighing deeply and trying to let the quiet soothe her soul. \"Actually I wish I could've met Jake. I have a feeling I would've liked him.\" \"You would've. And Jake would've liked you. You both have such caring, beautiful, committed, and protective souls.\" \"You good? Are we good?\" She nodded vigorously, brushing her nose against his, \"We couldn't be better Sam.\" \"I'm pretty sure your children are watching us from the kitchen window,\" Sam smiled as he said it. Cassie smiled and chuckled, imagining the faces of her precious children pressed against the glass, intently trying to read her mood based on her body language. \"I'm sure they are, they are hovering, and just concerned. I could feel Grace earlier and I tried to reassure her but everyone's a bit punchy today,\" Cassie replied after a quick glance at the kitchen window, no children in sight except the very end of Grace's ponytail as she quickly turned away from the window. Yes, she was absolutely sure they were watching them. Suddenly the back door opened and Grace stepped out, dressed in walking boots and a jacket, Cassie could see Lori shrugging into her coat behind Grace and Brandon fussing with containers on the kitchen counter. \"Mom?\" Grace slowly advanced on her mother and Sam, who were still seated together, grasping hands, trying to read them both. \"Its ok honey,\" she glanced at Sam and smiled, \"We're ok.\" She released one of Sam's hands to reach for Grace, offering her reassurance as Grace glanced back and forth between them, still gauging the situation. Grace reached for Sam's now free hand too, completing their triangle. Yes, she thought, they were ok, stressed and tired, but calm and content. \"Lori and I wanted to know if you wanted to go for a walk?\" Grace asked, not able to look away from them for fear that it was all a rouse. On cue Cassie heard Lori close the back door, striding toward them with purpose. \"That sounds wonderful,\" Cassie agreed. Squeezing Sam's hand, \"do you want to come Sam?\" He smiled at her, \"No I think this is a walk for you guys on your own,\" he looked Cassie in the eye, \"But I'll be here when you get back,\" reassuring her, \"I'll be right here.\" She nodded and smiled, looking at Sam, then Lori, and Grace. She closed her eyes for just a minute, silently revealing in and thanking the universe for her family, all of them. She felt the soft swirling of energy surrounding her, filling her, pulsing, and knowing he was present, she pushed up and stepped to the girls, holding Sam's hand for one last second before releasing him but both of them with her, combining her past love with her present; steadily. Just steady. ","Summary":" Short Story: Gray Days *Disclaimer: I don't own anything, least of all Good Witch.

When Grace and Nick get a chance to go away on a field trip for the weekend, Cassie and Sam look forward to some time alone. But will the weekend go as planned? Probably not. Some references to sex, but no actual sexual content. Part 1: Cassie Nightingale was peeling vegetables for dinner in the kitchen at Grey House when Grace arrived home from school on a snowy Tuesday afternoon. \"Hi Grace,\" Cassie greeted her daughter without looking up or turning around from the kitchen counter or the bunch of carrots in front of her. \"Hey mom,\" Grace shrugged out of her coat and pulled the purple beanie hat off her head. \"Dinner smells wonderful.\" \"It'll be about another hour,\" Cassie replied, nudging the cookie jar toward her daughter. \"Did you have a good day?\" Grace nodded, taking a large bite of almond cookie and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket at the same time. \"Miss Harris gave us these today,\" Grace said, waving the letter in her mother's direction. \"Our whole class have been invited for a weekend away snowboarding and skiing.\" \"Oh wow, Grace, that's great.\" Cassie was pleased for her, but Grace's new obsession with risk-taking hobbies ever since she had become friends with Courtney made her feel a little nervous. \"It's in two weeks' time,\" Grace reached for another cookie. \"I just need you to sign my permission slip.\" Cassie wiped her hands on a dishtowel and took the letter from Grace. She read it through, took a pen from one of the kitchen drawers and signed her name at the bottom. \"We'll go shopping at the weekend; pick you out some new winter clothes.\" \"Thanks mom,\" Grace leaned up and pressed a quick kiss into Cassie's cheek. Clutching the other half of her second cookie in her hand, Grace turned away to head upstairs to her bedroom. \"Grace,\" Cassie called after her. \"Is Nick going on the trip as well?\" \"Yeah, as long as his dad agrees.\" Cassie smiled as she turned back to the vegetable preparations. She would miss her daughter – they hardly spent any time apart especially since Jake had died, but the idea of having a weekend alone with Sam was certainly appealing. \"Hello Sam,\" Cassie said a while later, sitting in the living room with a cup of tea by her side. \"One day…\" Sam began, but there were some mysteries about Cassie that he was sure he'd never understand. \"Did Nick give you the letter about the field trip?\" Cassie asked, moving aside on the couch so that Sam could squeeze in next to her. \"A whole weekend without our kids, what on earth will we find to do with ourselves?\" Cassie laughed, leaning her head on Sam's shoulder. They had been dating for a while now, but between their teenage kids, Abigail and the guests at Grey House, it was hard for them to ever really have any time alone together. \"I'm sure we'll find some way of occupying ourselves.\" Sam's hand cupped her face and he gently ran his thumb of her bottom lip before moving in to kiss her. Cassie let herself give in to the kiss, wrapping her arms around Sam to pull him closer. She was so lost in the moment, that she didn't notice her cousin enter the room until Abigail let out a quiet cough. \"Sorry to interrupt,\" Abigail began, trying not to grin at the sight before her. \"I just thought I'd let you know that I'm going on the field trip with the kids.\" \"Really, why?\" Cassie asked. As far as she was aware, Abigail wasn't the biggest fan of children or teenagers. \"A free weekend away just to keep an eye on a few teenage girls – who was going to turn that down?\" Cassie smiled, that sounded more like the Abigail she knew and loved. \"I'll leave you two in peace now,\" Abigail smirked and slipped back out of the room. \"We really will have the weekend all to ourselves.\" Sam commented once Abigail had gone. \"I can hardly wait.\" Cassie echoed this sentiment by pressing her lips to his again. Just over two weeks later, Cassie, Sam and the two kids had breakfast together at Grey House before Grace and Nick left for their weekend away. Their bags and gear were in the hallway, and they were both too excited to each much breakfast. Abigail joined them a little later, dressed in jeans and an oversized sweater. \"Where's your skiing things Abigail?\" Grace asked between mouthfuls of oatmeal. \"You don't think I'm actually going to be joining in any of these activities, do you?\" Abigail laughed. \"No, I'm perfectly happy to watch. I've got my iPad and a stack of books.\" They laughed and finished breakfast together. It was soon time for the three of them to leave, and Sam was needed at his office. She walked him to the door while Grace and Nick collected their bags and Abigail put her boots on. \"I'll see you back here later, about six o'clock.\" Sam said, taking both of Cassie's hands in his. \"Looking forward to it.\" She leaned up and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips before going inside of say goodbye to her daughter. Cassie was distracted at the shop, which was unusual for her. She was preoccupied by worrying about Grace and also looking forward to spending some quality time alone with Sam. Tara noticed that Cassie didn't seem like herself and offered to close up for her. Cassie was grateful, picking up a few different bottles of essential oils and an extra canister of Sam's favourite tea-that-tastes-like-coffee. \"Have a lovely weekend, Cassie.\" Tara said as Cassie put her coat on and prepared to leave the Bell, Book and Candle. \"Thanks Tara, you too.\" Cassie decided to walk home along the cold, frosty Middleton streets. It gave her some time to centre her thoughts and prepare for the evening ahead. She had already prepped the dinner as much as possible; she didn't want to waste precious time with Sam by being in the kitchen. She stopped off at the bistro to pick up a bottle of wine and some of Sam's favourite cakes. Stephanie had it all ready for her in a to-go bag. \"Such service,\" Cassie smiled as she handed over a twenty dollar bill. \"It's on me,\" Stephanie replied, holding up her hands. \"You go on and have a lovely night with Sam. You're always doing things for other people, it's time you had a night to yourselves.\" \"Thank you, Stephanie.\" Cassie replied warmly. \"Now get on out of here before Martha comes in, or you won't be home before Grace gets back from her trip!\" Cassie picked up her bag, wished Stephanie a good weekend and headed back into the cold. \"How many more appointments have I got this afternoon, Eve?\" Sam asked his receptionist between patients. He loved his job; loved being a doctor and being a part of the community but the day was dragging. He just wanted to go home to Cassie and get their weekend started. \"Old Mrs Robbins is in at four o'clock, and then you've got twenty minutes. Dana Harford is in after that. Your last appointment is at five fifteen.\" \"Thanks, Eve. Let me know if anyone gets here early, I'd like to be out of here as soon as possible today.\" \"Yes, boss.\" Eve replied. \"Have you got something planned?\" Sam smiled. \"I'm spending the whole weekend with Cassie.\" \"Oh, of course, Nick and Grace are away on that trip…I can call and cancel your last appointments if you want?\" Sam's smile grew to a grin at this. \"As great as that would be, I don't want the whole town knowing I ducked out of my job early to go and spend it with my girlfriend.\" \"Your girlfriend?\" Eve smiled. \"Cassie's your girlfriend.\" \"Yes,\" Sam realised he'd never referred to her as such, and definitely not out loud. \"I guess she is.\" Finally Sam waved off his last patient of the day and took off his white doctor's coat. He dismissed Eve for the weekend and locked up the offices. It took a while for the car windshield to defrost and he turned the heat on high as he drove back home. It was strange to see the house in darkness; normally Nick would be there doing his homework or watching TV with Courtney when he got home from work. In contrast, Grey House looked warm and welcoming. He knew Cassie would be in the kitchen, cooking something that looked amazing. They would eat together, share a bottle of wine and then later… Well, perhaps it was best not to think of that just yet. Wishing he had stopped for a bouquet of flowers, and then remembering that the flower market was closed because Abigail was away too, Sam made his way into Grey House. \"Hey Sam,\" Cassie greeted, her face flushed from the steam of the curry she was cooking. He stopped in the kitchen doorway, unable to say anything. She was dressed in fitted navy blue jeans and a v-necked black sweater, but she had never looked more breathtaking to him. \"Everything alright?\" She asked, stirring the sauce and lowering the heat underneath. \"Yes, it's great.\" His voice was a little rough and Cassie noticed. She stepped away from the stove and crossed the room to him, wrapping her arms around him and pressing her lips to his. He pulled her closed to him, their bodies pressed together as the kiss deepened. \"Sam,\" She broke away reluctantly. \"I'm going to burn our dinner if we don't stop.\" Sam took a deep, steadying breath. \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" \"Sure, you can set the table and open the wine, if you like.\" Glad to have something to do that took his mind off the way that Cassie felt in his arms, Sam set about laying out cutlery and pouring the deep burgundy wine into two glasses. They had the whole weekend together, there was no sense in rushing anything. They ate dinner together, followed by a large slice of cake washed down with the rest of the red wine. They washed up together in the kitchen, just like an ordinary couple. It was nice to just do normal tasks together without being interrupted by one of their kids, Abigail or a needy guest. Cassie found another bottle of wine in the cupboard; not as good as the one Stephanie had given her but drinkable or the same. They took the bottle and two glasses into the living room and curled up on a couch together. They sipped the wine and exchanged slow easy kisses, until Cassie climbed into Sam's lap. The kisses got deeper; sloppier; messier and more frenzied. Sam's hands rested on her sides, but began to slip up under the material of her sweater to dance over her soft flesh. Cassie shivered and it was nothing to do with the coolness of Sam's hands. She climbed up out of his lap and held out her hand to him. He let her lead him up the stairs to her bedroom, his heartbeat thundering in his ears. And when they laid down on the bed together, he realised it; he loved her. A while later, Cassie padded downstairs wearing nothing but Sam's shirt. It was too big in the shoulders and it barely grazed her thighs, but it felt good and smelled of him. She poured herself a glass of water while she waited for the kettle to boil. She'd make them to some tea, take it back upstairs and they could drink it snuggled up together in her bed. The thought gave her another little thrill. As the kettle whistled, Cassie was suddenly aware of another presence in the house. She hadn't noticed it before but then she had been so preoccupied with Sam that she might not have noticed if the house had burned down around them. She went through to the living room, the bottle of wine and two half-filled glasses still sitting on the coffee table. \"Lori, honey, what are you doing here?\"[Chapter 2] The Weekend Thank you for the reviews/favs on the first chapter. I haven't written for Good Witch before so I'm still getting used to writing these characters! This story is sort of set during season 2, Liam and Noah haven't moved to Middleton yet but Nick and Courtney are together. As for George, I'm not sure where he is! I thought I was so clever getting rid of Abigail so that Sam and Cassie could have their weekend together, but I forgot all about George (which sucks because he's one of my favourites!). Hope you enjoy the next part :) x Part 2. Cassie's stepdaughter was curled up in one of the easy chair, her face pale and her eyes red from crying. She looked much younger – like the little girl who had been scared of monsters when Cassie had first met her. \"I'm sorry that I just turned up,\" Lori said, wiping her eyes with a balled up tissue. \"I should have called you first, but I didn't know where else to go.\" Cassie opened her mouth to reassure Lori that it was okay; that she was always welcome at Grey House no matter what but she was interrupted. \"Hey Cassie, can you make me some of that tea-that-tastes-like-coff…\" Sam had entered the living room, dressed in his boxer shorts and undershirt. Unlike Cassie, he had assumed that it was still just the two of them at the house. \"Oh, Lori, hi.\" Lori looked over at Sam and back at Cassie, realisation dawning on her. She rushed to her feet, nearly knocking the chair over in her hurry. \"Oh my God, I'm so sorry.\" \"Sam, please can you go and make us all some tea,\" Cassie said calmly, and he quickly and quietly left the room. \"Oh Cassie, I'm sorry. I didn't think…I didn't realise.\" Cassie shook her head. \"It's not your fault, please don't apologise. I should have told you that things had moved along between Sam and I. I hope it doesn't upset you too much.\" \"No, it's… I like Sam. He's a good guy and he cares about you, but…\" \"It's weird seeing me with someone other than your dad?\" Lori nodded, feeling the tears welling up again and not trusting her voice. \"It doesn't change anything. I'll always love your dad, until the day I die. But I think he'd want me to be happy; I think he'd approve of a man like Sam.\" Lori nodded again. \"He would.\" She stepped closer to Cassie and wrapped her arms around her. \"I'm so sorry for ruining your night.\" \"It's okay. You caught us on the weekend that both our kids and Abigail are away.\" \"It did seem awfully quiet.\" Sam came back in with three cups of tea on a tray and set it down on the table. He picked up his own cup. \"I'm going back upstairs, let me know if you need me.\" \"Thanks,\" Cassie smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. \"Now,\" Cassie said, once they were alone. \"You're going to tell me all about what brought you're here tonight, Lori.\" Just over an hour later, Lori was tucked up in bed in her old room and Cassie went back to her bedroom. She thought Sam might be asleep, it was after midnight now and he had had a long day at the office. It was nice to come upstairs and find him in her bed. It had been a long time since she had shared it with another man and there had been times when she wondered whether she would ever have another lover. Jake had been her whole world and she had never known love could be like that until she had met him. Losing him had been incomprehensible, especially with Grace being so young. Sam reminded her of Jake in some ways, they were both strong, loyal men and loving fathers but they had their differences too. \"Oh, you are still awake.\" Cassie whispered as she pulled back the bed covers and slid under the sheet. \"Is Lori okay?\" Sam asked, rolling over towards her and pulling her into his arms. \"She will be,\" Cassie replied, resting her head on his chest so she could hear his heartbeat, sure and strong. \"Boy trouble.\" She said simply, suddenly too tired to talk about and she wanted to respect her stepdaughter's privacy too. \"Men,\" Sam said, rolling his eyes. \"I said it was okay for her to stay this weekend, I hope that's alright?\" \"Of course,\" Sam was disappointed, it was so rare that they ever got a chance to be together without being interrupted, but he knew that Cassie needed to be there for Lori. \"I'm not kicking you out though, Sam, I want you to say too.\" \"Are you sure? It can't have been easy for Lori; seeing you with someone that wasn't her dad?\" \"No, but she likes you and I plan on you being in my life for a long time so she'll have to start getting used to you being around.\" \"Oh really,\" Sam replied, pulling her closer to him and pressing a kiss onto the top of her head. They drifted off to sleep like that, wrapped up in each other's arms underneath the sheets. Cassie slipped out of bed and left Sam sleeping the next morning. It was hard to leave him; he looked so peaceful and so adorable tucked up in her bed. Him being there just looked and felt so right. She couldn't find her feelings for him anymore; there was no denying it – she was in love with him. She took off Sam's shirt and dressed in her nightgown and robe. The house was quiet as she started cooking breakfast and setting the kettle to boil. Lori appeared as she was stirring the oatmeal and began to set the table without being asked; settling back into an old routine. \"It seems strange without Grace here,\" Lori commented as she tore off paper napkins and set them beside the three place settings. \"I know, we hardly ever spend any time apart. I miss her.\" Cassie sighed. \"I'm sure she's having a great time though. \"Oh, she is. My phone was bursting with pictures this morning.\" She smiled. \"She'll be sad to know she missed a visit from you.\" Lori bit her bottom lip. \"I'm thinking about moving back to Middleton again, L.A. just doesn't really suit me. I know I keep chopping and changing, but my heart has always been in Middleton.\" \"Well, if that's what you decide is best for you, then we'd be more than happy to have you back.\" Lori smiled, feeling better for talking to Cassie the same way she had since she was a little girl. \"I'm going to see Brandon and Tara later, I'm going to ask if I can stay with them tonight. It's not fair for me to gatecrash the one weekend that you and Sam finally have alone together.\" \"It's okay Lori, this is your home too and I'd hate to think that you felt you weren't welcome here. Sam and I can always go to his place, then I'll only be next door if you need me.\" \"Something smells good,\" Sam said, walking into the kitchen. Lori noticed how at home he seemed at Grey House. It was certainly strange seeing Cassie so intimate with another man, but she knew it was time. Cassie deserved to be happy more than anyone she knew. \"Morning Sam,\" Cassie smiled, and Lori could see the joy in her shining eyes. The three of them ate a companionable breakfast together, talking about stories Lori had worked on but carefully avoiding anything that related to her broken heart and bruised pride. When the breakfast things were washed and tidied away, Lori excused herself to go and see her brother and his wife. \"You're amazing, you know,\" Sam said, taking Cassie into his arms. \"I'm still in my nightdress!\" Cassie protested, but she didn't stop him when he lowered his head to kiss her lips. \"But you're still beautiful,\" He said, when they broke apart for air. \"Sam…\" \"Cassie, I love you.\"[Chapter 3] The Weekend Part 3 Lori walked to Brandon and Tara's place - enjoying the crisp morning and soaking up the Middleton atmosphere again. When she had left L.A. it was barely cold enough for gloves, but here the snow was still piled up on the sidewalks. She walked up to Brandon and Tara's building and stamped snow from her boots. She waited patiently for the door to open and was almost swept off her feet by Brandon. \"Lori! What a surprise! I didn't know you were coming for a visit.\" \"Surprise,\" She replied weakly, and then broke down in tears, shocking them both. \"Tara, Lori's here! Put some coffee on!\" Brandon shouted, leading his sister inside and shutting out the cold winter morning. Tara had just finished getting dressed and was putting her hair up in a ponytail. She looked as surprised as her husband when Brandon led Tara into their kitchen. \"Lori, it's great to see you, but were we expecting you?\" She handed her sister-in-law a box of tissues and waited for Lori to stop crying before she fired any more questions at her. Brandon and Tara had a silent conversation made up entirely of facial expressions over the top of Lori's head while they waited for the coffee to brew and for Lori to get herself together. I love you. The words echoed between Cassie and Sam in the big, empty kitchen at Grey House. I love you. No one had said that to her in a very long time; not in the way Sam was saying it. Grace told her she loved her all the time; Abigail too and her step-children but no one had said I love you like that since Jake. So many emotions bubbled to the surface at once that Cassie froze; Cassie Nightingale who always knew exactly the right thing to say; the right thing to suggest was suddenly incapable of saying a word. \"It's okay if you don't feel the same,\" Sam continued, while Cassie stood staring at him. \"I just wanted you to know and I hope it doesn't change anything between us.\" \"Sam…\" \"It's okay, just pretend I never said anything and we'll just focus on enjoying our weekend…unless I've gone and ruined it now.\" \"Sam,\" She said, a little firmer now. She remembered how she had felt last night when she and Sam had gone to bed together; the reverent way that he had held her and how gentle and passionate he had been. She had never thought or expected to fall in love again after Jake, but it was different with Sam but no less potent. \"Sam, I love you, too.\" His face broke into a grin. \"You do? You're not just saying it because you feel bad for me because I just mad an ass of myself?\" Cassie laughed. \"I love you all the more for that.\" She reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling his face down to hers. They kissed, gently at first but increasing in passion. They had planned on going out for a walk, before going to the bistro for a late lunch but before either of them knew what was happening they were making their way back upstairs to Cassie's bedroom again. Brandon, feeling a little out of place in his own home while Tara and Lori chatted, decided to go for a walk. The two women sat on opposite ends of the couch, a mug of coffee each. \"Have you talked to Cassie about what happened?\" Tara asked. Lori swallowed her sip of coffee and nodded. \"It was a little awkward though, I didn't know she had Sam staying over at Grey House.\" Tara raised her eyebrows. \"Well, Grace and Nick are away for the weekend so it makes sense.\" \"I didn't know that until I almost walked in on them,\" Lori blushed. \"So awkward. I should have called first but I was so upset over what happened with Darren that I just climbed in my car and drove straight to Middleton.\" \"Has he tried to call you since?\" \"I turned my phone off.\" Lori admitted. \"I don't know what he thinks he can say that will make it better. \"Is there any chance that you maybe got the wrong end of the stick?\" Lori shook her head. \"What is there to misinterpret about coming home and finding your boyfriend in bed with another woman?\" \"Fair enough. You're better off without him. What about your job though?\" \"I'm going to call in sick on Monday and start looking for something else. I'm thinking about moving back to Middleton again, permanently this time.\" \"It'll be good to have you back.\" Lori and Tara toasted this by clinking their coffee mugs together and Lori smiled genuinely for the first time since she'd been back in Middleton. \"Wow,\" Sam sighed, rolling onto his back and trying to catch his breath. \"We're getting pretty good at that.\" Cassie led on her back, pulling the bed cover backs up over her and smiled like a cat with a lifetime's supply of cream. \"Doesn't mean we shouldn't keep practicing, though.\" Sam laughed. \"You'll have to give me a little, I'm not as young as I used to be.\" \"You're as young as you feel, Sam.\" \"Well, right now I feel pretty good.\" \"It's been a long time since I've laid in bed in the middle of the day.\" Cassie said, moving over to rest her head on Sam's shoulder. \"Me too. It's been years.\" \"How are we going to work this out when Grace and Nick get home?\" She pondered. \"They're at an impressionable age. Their friends will start having sex soon, if they haven't already. We can hardly forbid them from it, if we're doing it ourselves.\" \"I think Nick and Courtney might have already experimented…\" \"Grace hasn't had her first kiss yet. I thought she and Anthony mind end up becoming more than friends, but then he moved away.\" \"I guess we'll just take it one step at a time. Maybe have a few weekends away at the lake house, just the two of us. I'm sure Abigail or George would be happy to keep an eye on the kids.\" \"Sounds perfect. It was where we had our first proper kiss after all.\" Grudgingly, Cassie sat up in bed. \"Now we'd better get to the bistro for lunch, or we'll be the talk of this town.\" \"Cassie, we already are.\" Thanks again for the reviews/favs. I hope you enjoyed this chapter too :)[Chapter 4] The Weekend Sorry for the delay in updating - I've been watching some of the Good Witch movies and it's hard to write Cassie/Sam when you've just watched Cassie and Jake get married! Thanks again for the reviews, I hope you like this chapter. Part 4 When Cassie and Sam arrived at the bistro, Brandon and Tara were already occupying one of the larger tables. Brandon waved his stepmother over and, after greeting Stephanie, Cassie and Sam joined him and Tara. \"Where's Lori?\" Cassie asked, unwinding her scarf from her neck as she sat down. \"She ran into an old friend from high school; she'll be along in a minute.\" Brandon replied. \"Was she okay when she was with you?\" \"She was quite upset,\" Tara replied. \"But once she'd had a good cry, I think she felt better. She's awfully embarrassed that she interrupted your weekend together though.\" Brandon suddenly found his iPhone very interesting during this part of the conversation. It wasn't that he didn't want Cassie to be with Sam; but at the end of the day she was his stepmom and there were certain things about her life, particularly her love life that he really didn't need to think about. \"She can stay with us tonight, if you like?\" Tara continued. \"That would be nice,\" Cassie considered. \"But I don't want her to feel like she's not welcome at Grey House; it's her home, too.\" \"I'll suggest it like a girly night in,\" Tara replied. \"Brandon is on duty tonight anyway.\" \"That settles it,\" Cassie smiled, relieved that this plan seemed to work out for everybody. Normally it would be her smoothing things out for everybody else, but she just seemed to be too close this. Maybe her feelings for Sam were clouding her abilities. \"That settles what?\" Lori asked, appearing at the table and choosing the empty seat opposite her stepmother. \"Lori, how would you feel about coming over tonight? Brandon's working tonight so we can order a pizza, watch a crappy movie and paint each other's nails or something?\" \"That sounds great,\" Lori replied eagerly. With that settled, they ordered their food and ate together companionably as a happy, extended family. \"Do you trust me?\" Sam asked later that afternoon. After indulging in far too much of Stephanie's wonderful lunchtime special at the bistro, they had decided to take a walk around Middleton. It was still freezing cold, but they were wrapped up warm against the chilled wind. \"Of course I do, what kind of a question is that?\" Cassie laughed. \"Ah yes, but do you trust me to cook for you tonight?\" Cassie had a flashback to when he had attempt to cook before and felt slightly uneasy. As nice as it was that a man wanted to cook for her, she'd rather just do it herself or order a takeout. \"Maybe we could cook together?\" She suggested diplomatically. \"That could be fun,\" Sam replied. \"But you're always doing things for other people, I wanted to do something special for you.\" \"This weekend has been so special so far Sam; I couldn't have asked for a better one.\" \"Me neither,\" Sam linked his gloved hand with Cassie's. \"Well, maybe without your stepdaughter walking in on us in our underwear!\" Cassie laughed. \"Yes, that wasn't exactly part of the plan.\" She squeezed Sam's hand. \"It's nice that she's thinking of coming back to Middleton again, I've missed her.\" Sam released Cassie's hand and wrapped his arm around her shoulder instead, pulling her closer. \"I love you, Cassie.\" It was still so new; the feelings and saying them out loud but it felt so right, too. \"I love you, too.\" She smiled up at him and, for the first time since Jake had died, she felt really, truly happy with her life. Abigail Pershing was bored. It was only Saturday afternoon, but it felt like she had been away from Middleton for far long than that. She had thought, seeing as she was doing her cousin and Sam a favour by staying out of town for the weekend, that she would at least enjoy herself a little bit. Teenagers were definitely not as interesting as they had been when she was one. She already knew that Grace was a good girl of course, but she had expected as least some of the students on the trip to be at least a little bit rebellious. Even Nick, who had been a bit difficult and liked to act out when he first arrived in Middleton, had now mellowed. Abigail thought this was probably something to do with Grace, and by extension Cassie. She was starting to miss the flower shop. Saturday afternoons were usually quite busy and had been so successful recently that she was thinking about taking on some extra help at the weekends. With a sigh, Abigail reached for her latte and took a sip, looking out over the snowy landscape. It was warm inside the hilltop cafe but Abigail shivered looking out at the expanse of snow. \"I think you've got the better idea,\" A male voice said from behind her. \"Staying in here with a hot cup of coffee.\" Abigail turned around to see a tall, fair-haired man holding a tray with a cappuccino on it. At that moment, a snowsuit-clad teenager went speeding down the hillside making Abigail wince and grip tighter to her coffee cup. \"I think so, too,\" She agreed, giving the stranger another closer look. The cafe was quite busy, mostly filled with parents who were waiting for the children to finish skiing or snowboarding lessons. \"You can join me if you like.\" The man smiled, taking the vacant chair opposite Abigail. \"I'm Harry, by the way.\" He offered Abigail his hand. \"Abigail,\" She replied, impressed with his warm, firm handshake. \"What brings you out here to the snowy middle of nowhere?\" \"I'm supervising some students on a school trip,\" He replied. \"Me too,\" Abigail smiled. \"But I discovered I'm not really a snow person.\" Harry smiled, too. \"After the third time I fell over in five minutes, I decided it wasn't for me either.\" Abigail was starting to change her mind; maybe this trip wouldn't be quite so boring after all. Sam and Cassie went to the market together, to pick up ingredients for dinner and another bottle of wine. \"If I'm cooking,\" Sam said, while Cassie examined the fresh produce. \"I think that means you're on clean up duty.\" \"If you're cooking?\" Cassie teased, knowing that it wouldn't be long before she ended up taking over from him. \"Yes,\" Sam replied, proudly. They continued their shopping, stopping every now and then for Cassie to exclaim over something or pick up a herb she was getting short of. They were so caught up in each other that they didn't notice what a domestic picture they painted; talking, laughing and occasionally holding hands as they walked up and down the aisles. Neither of them mentioned it, but they both realised that they would happy doing this every Saturday afternoon for the rest of their lives.[Chapter 5] The smell emanating from the kitchen in Sam's house was pretty delicious. Cassie had taken over most of the cooking duties, as she had expected (and secretly hoped) would happen. Sam was in charge of boiling the pasta water and setting their places at the table. He realised too late that he had meant to ask Cassie for some candles from her shop to set the mood. Of course, Cassie being Cassie had already thought of this and two slim candles were currently hidden away in her purse. Cassie added a sprinkle of several different herbs she had found in Sam's kitchen cupboards; herbs he was pretty sure he had never bought for himself. Where Cassie was concerned, he had learned there were some things it was better not to question. The water in the saucepan was still determined not to boil, despite the burner being on full blast beneath it. Sam took this as an opportunity to close the distance between himself and Cassie at the stove. He stood behind her, his hands resting gently on her hips. He leaned forward a little, breathing in the scent of her dark hair. He was beginning to realise that if he didn't breakaway from her soon, their dinner would be the last thing on his mind. \"Sam!\" Cassie protested, but she was laughing when she turned her head to capture his lips with hers. He slid his hand into her hair, cupping the back of her neck as he deepened the kiss. \"Sam...\" Cassie breathed as they broke apart a little unsteadily. \"Water is boiling.\" Muttering under his breath, Sam went back to his original position and added the salt and pasta to the pan. Cassie was smirking to herself as she turned her attention back to the sauce. After her coffee date with Harry, Abigail was feeling better about the whole trip. They had made plans to meet up again the next day and Abigail had found out that the school where Harry worked wasn't all that far from Middleton. She was feeling quite pleased with herself as she headed back to the chalet where she was supervising a group of teenage girls, including Grace. Grace looked radiant after a day of skiing on the slopes with her friends. At least Abigail assumed that was why she looked so happy, but her Merriwick intuition told her differently. Maybe this trip wasn't going to end up being boring at all. Lori and Tara sat up talking for hours while Brandon was at work. They had a lot of catching up to do, and Lori was interested in how Tara was adjusting to life in Middleton and working for Cassie rather than pursuing her PhD. Lori knew that she would be limiting her career options by choosing to come back home to live, but she couldn't deny that it felt right. She hadn't been Cassie's stepdaughter for this long without being able to trust her own initiative. It was a shame that initiative had been lacking where her ex boyfriend had been concerned. Would she have stayed away on assignment in L.A. for so long if she hadn't been in a relationship with him? It did her no good to wonder about these things now. She trusted that she had been brought back to Middleton for a reason, and time would tell what that reason was. For now, it was enough to catch up with her family and friends. When Brandon came home from his shift he found his wife and sister asleep on the living room couch. Smiling fondly at both of them, he took the blanket from the back of the couch and draped it over the two women. Pressing a kiss to Tara's cheek, he went through to his bedroom and left the women sleeping. Later that evening they led cuddled up in bed together, the room bathed in the warn and fragrant glow of Cassie's candles. \"I'm really going to miss sharing a bed with you once the kids come back.\" Sam said, absentmindedly stroking Cassie's silky hair. It was only their second night together but it already felt normal and natural. \"Me too,\" Cassie replied. \"I don't think we're ready to live together yet though, and I definitely don't think Grace or Nick are.\" \"You're right,\" Sam sighed, unable to come up with a scenario that would suit everybody. He was determined not to let it get them down or spoil what was left of their weekend together, though. \"Have you heard from Grace?\" He asked. \"Yes, she's having a wonderful time. I'm trying not to think about all the terrifying things she told me she's done already.\" \"Nick texted me this afternoon, sounds like he's having fun,\" He paused. \"I just can't picture Abigail on skis though.\" Cassie laughed as she tried to conjure up the mental picture. \"If I know my cousin, I doubt she's set foot outside for more than ten minutes.\" Sam frowned. \"What did she agree to go then?\" Cassie smiled at him, one eyebrow arching up. \"Ohh...\" It dawned on him. \"I'm leaving her the biggest tip next time I'm in the flower shop. Who knew she was such a romantic?\" \"She likes to keep it a secret, I wouldn't mention it.\" \"My lips are sealed.\" He leaned down to kiss her lips instead. Cassie sighed and let the feeling of his kiss and his body pressed to her's carry her away. They were both dozing when the front door of Sam's house burst open as if a storm had blown through sleepy, snow covered Middleton. \"Sam!\" A woman's shrill voice broke through the haze and Cassie vaguely wondered what the chances of having both of their nights together interrupted by unexpected visitors. At least she had been happy to see Lori. \"Linda?\" Sam said groggily, seconds before the bedroom door was opened. He was suddenly overwhelmingly regretting letting his ex wife have a key. \"Sam! What are you doing in bed at 8pm on a Saturday?\" It was then that she was that Sam wasn't alone. \"Cassie.\" \"Linda.\" She replied as casually as she could. \"What are you doing?\" Sam demanded, sitting up in bed and glaring at his ex. \"Haven't you heard?\" Linda's voice was close to cracking. \"It's Nick. He's been in a terrible accident!\" I had been thinking about wrapping this story up, but I got some inspiration to continue. Hope you enjoyed :) ","Summary":" The Weekend Summary: Cassie/Sam.

Yo te tengo- finalmente recogió a Kell y voló a un lugar seguro -Kara, ¿qué- qué?¿Cómo?¿Qué hiciste ?¿Cómo hiciste eso?- espetó el chaval- Gracias Kara, me salvaste la vida... podría haber muerto...Dev-Em, él me empujó... fue Dev-Em. ¡Fue él! Kara se despertó bruscamente en una cápsula con una sustancia viscosa anaranjada en una nave espacial y vestida de una camiseta y pantalones blancos y dijo -Sólo fue un sueño Se levantó y preguntó en voz alta -¡Hola! ¿Por qué nadie me despertó? Más tarde, se cambió de ropa , escuchó un sonido extraño y fue a investigar. Llegó a la cabina de los pilotos y preguntó: -¿Por qué tenemos que seguir el curso? Nunca sabremos que encontraremos allí afuera. No hubo respuesta por ninguno de ellos -Dac, Dac- siguió insistiendo-¿Dac puedes escucharme? Le giró hacia ella y se encontró con el cuerpo putrefacto -! Dac!- se asombró a ver el cádaver y miró a su compañero que también estaba en descomposición- ¡Kexx, no! -Estuviste dormida por mucho tiempo...- dijo una voz masculina -Esa voz..., tú- ella sabía quien era -...Pero, me alegra que estés despierta. Hola, Kara El hombre era de pelo rubio,alto y con una cicatriz en la cara -¡Tú...Tú ibas a ser ejecutado Dev-Em!¡El Consejo de Ley te dio pena de muerte!- dijo Kara con asombro -Je, digamos con acuerdo...No todos en Consejo de La Ley estaba de acuerdo con mi ejecución...Era más fácil para ellos escaparme que destruir los valores de Krypton que pasó cultivando y aún mejor arrojar la evidencia de su indescreción- explicó Dev-Em -¿Y mi equipo? -Después del primer día, me di cuenta que la forma de entrar en el almacén de comida era con las huellas de la mano. El Oficial Kexo...pero al final... la mano fue mía. -Perdiste la cabeza -¿Así le hablas a tus viejos amigo, Kara? -No eres mi amigo. Eres un asesino condenado, que mató para abrirse camino para entrar una nave... -¡Y ahora estoy en la nave!¿El plan de Lord Rao no es grandioso? Mientras el villano parloteaba, la capitana intentó huir -¿ A dónde vas? Tuve 10 años para explorar esta nave, Kara... Dev-Em pulsó los botones del asiento y las compuertas se cerraron -¡No!- Kara gritó desesperada - 10 años para aprender a controlarla con la autorización de las huellas de Kex de todo. Encontré comida, un lugar para dormir. No tenía nada que ocupar en mi mente. No complentamente, así que sólo... Vi pasar las estrellas... Los ví dormir , los ví soñar. Kara, eres tan bella cuando duermes. Finalmente me di cuenta que estaba solo...Así que desperté algunos. Ho-Paa no estaba segura de seguir mi liderazgo al principio, pero... En un momento de despite Kara le golpeó con el casco sangrando la cabeza del malo y le obligó -Quédate ahí, Dev-Em, no quiero pelear -Tú...Tú ¡Me lastimaste!- masculló Dev-Em. Después se lanzó contra ella y rugió: -¡Tú y yo estamos destinados a estar juntos!¡Sólo quedamos nosotros dos!¡Ibamos a poblar el Sistema Solar con innumerables Kryptonianos!¡Íbamos! Dev-Em golpeó la pared de la nave y espetó cuando vio el bollo que provocó -¡El Sistema Solar nunca fue nuestro destino!¿A dónde nos trajiste?- Kara le corrigió mientras seguía golpeando -¡A dónde tenía que ir!- aventó a Kara Después se acercó hacia la chica y la amenazó: -Me seguiras...¡o seguiras a tu equipo a los brazos de Rao! -Yo.. no ...lo creo. La chica impulsó con sus piernas el cuerpo de villano provocando una fuerte explosión en la nave Una voz femenina robótica sonó y dijo: -¡Advertencia!¡Estabilizadores dañados!¡Sistemas de navegación dañados!¡Sistema de control dañados!¡Buscando sitio más cercano para aterrizaje de emergencia! Kara recupero el equilibrio cuando Dev-Em le agarra del cuello y expresó: -¡Arruinaste mi vida de nuevo, Kara Zor-EL!¿No ves el futuro que podríamos haber compartido juntos? No importa. Una vez que active el códice de crecimiento y cultivaré nuevos Kryptonianos. En ese momento Kara sacó una caja le contestó: -No Dev-Em...¡No verás nada del fúturo del Krypton! Ella le clavó en la mano del malo una piedra y escapó hacia una cápsula. -¡Sitio para aterrizaje de emergencia encontrado!El daño de la nave es incalculable comenzando procedimiento aterrizaje de emergencia ahora- dijo la voz robótica -¡Computadora , esta es la capitana Zor-El!¡Dame los controles!- la chica la ordenó -Procedemientos de aterrizaje de emergencia abortado. Los controles están activos ahora. -¡Gracias!Ahora reconfigura nuestra trayectoria a... -Alerta, Alerta, fuego en panel de cont... -No... -Auto reparación iniciada... La cápsula estaba cayendo sobre La Tierra, en un momento desesperado Kara intentó controlarlo -¡Muévete, muévete!- dijo a la nave -¡Advertencia ! Impacto en 3, 2,1 -Kell, ayúdame... La cápsula chocó contra la Tierra. Varios Años Después Pasaron mucho tiempo cuando la cápsula de Kara aterrizó sobre La Tierra unos hombres de la NASA, unos hombres llamó a su jefe -¿Señor? -¿Qué sucede Robinson? -¡Es el satélite , señor!¡Detectó una señal! -Si es lo que hacen Robinson. Los satélites de observación de la Tierra monitorean todo el planeta, desde señales de radio hasta patrones de tiempo. es diferente a cualquier cosa que hayamos visto antes. -Ponlo todo en la pantalla principal. ¿Cuándo comenzó y de dónde viene? Salieron la pantalla y Robison siguió -20 minutos atrás tuvimos un problema precisando la ubicación, pero parece que la señal se origina en isla Ellesmeré, señor, Canadá -Hicimos una expendición en helicóptero el año pasado .No hay nada más que hielo -La señal viene de debajo del hielo -Esas capas tienen miles de años. ¿Qué podría hacer abajo? -¡Y aun más importante!...¿A quién le estaba enviando el mensaje? Esto es más un resumen del cómic para la segunda parte será versión propia[Chapter 2] Capítulo 2: Descubrimiento Varios soldados desesterraron un montón de capa de nieve y un helicóptero aterrizó en la base miltar. En el vehículo salieron un hombre y 3 personas jóvenes (2 hombres y 1 chica) Uno de los militares exclamó: -¡Teneís que iros de aquí! -Lo siento, pero no podemos irnos, vosotros habeís encontrado algo. Yo me llamo y ellos Ethan, Billy y Mary- corrigió el anciano -Mejor entremos adentro.- sugirió el general Entraron en un refugio y el Doctor explicó: -Venimos a investigar a la excavación y he traido algunos de mis alumnos. -Sabemos que los neardarthales, dibujaron una figura del cielo-suguió Ethan que enseñó las fotos con el dibujo de una capsula espacial. -Recibimos una señal de la NASA, hemos desenterrado grandes capas de hielo y hemos algo parecido a una fortaleza- explicó un General -Tenemos pensando entrar.- dijo Mary -Si vais a entrar tendreis que ir acompañados por soldados. Mientras tanto Kara estaba paseando por con Kneel cuando Dev-Em cuando le tira por el barranco -¡Kara, ayudame!- gritó Kneel desesperado -Dev-Em ,¿qué haces?- preguntó Kara -Sólo lo hago por ti... porque quiero que esté conmigo.- respondió Dev-Em -Estás enfermo. Dev-Em se acercaba y dijo: -Más quisiera... pero no si quieres unirte, acabará cómo él. -Kara, me resbalo.- desesperó Kneel Dev-Em se lanzó contra la chica pero ella le da una patada y el cuerpo del malo cayó al barranco -No puedo más - dijo Kneel El chico se soltó de la mano y Kara saltó hacia él gritando -¡Nooo! La chica atrapó y se lo llevó a un lugar seguro. -Gracias, Kara, sin tí estaría muerto... muerto. Kara se despertó de la cápsula y dijo: -Es un sueño. La chica se levantó y preguntó para ella misma: -¿Dónde estoy? La chica estuvo en shock y recordó: -Recuerdo que me escapé de Dev-Em e hice un aterrizaje de emergencia... Kara llamó a su intercomunicador. -¡Aquí la capitana Kara Zor-EL, ¿ me reciben alguien?... Cambio No hubo respuesta. Indagó por el camino y asombrada dijo: -Esto parece Kryptoniano. Mientras paseaba se encontró con un robot y ella preguntó: -¿Quien eres? El robot no respondió. En ese momento, se escuchó un ruido y el robot se fue a la zona -¡Espera!- gritó Kara El grupo de estaba en la Fortaleza y Billy exclamó: -¡Increíble!, nadie diría que fuese alienígena -Mejor sigamos buscando. Se encontraron con 2 caminos y sugirió Dr. Hamilton -Mejor que separemos. se fue con un grupo de soldados y los alumnos se fueron con otro grupo de soldados. El grupo de alumnos se fueron por la zona donde estaba las cápsulas y Mary miró en el interior y se asustó: -Un muerto. -Parece que el alien tiene aspecto humanoide- comentó Billy -¡Mirad!- exclamó uno de los soldados -Parece que algo o alguien salió de la nave Por detrás apareció el robot -Ese robot puede que haya salido de la cápsula- musitó otro soldado -Venimos en Sol de Paz...- gritó Billy para entenderse El androide miró las armas de los soldados y sacó una unas cuchillas cortantes giratorias. -¡Dispara!-gritó uno de los soldados Mientras los soldados dispararon , los alumnos se escondieron. El robot mató a los soldados y cuando se acercó a los chicos; Kara pensó -Tengo que salvarlos Se acercó al androide y gritó: -Deja a ellos en paz El robot atacó a ella, le hizó un arañazo y con sus tentáculos la agarró, sus cuchillas se acercaron a la cara y dijo: -Déjame en paz Ella lanzó el robot contra la pared y espetó: -¿Cómo lo he hecho? Se marchó, sorprendida, y los chicos preguntaron -¿Quién es esa chica? -No sé pero tenemos que decirlo al Doctor En el pasillo, la joven Kryptoniana pensó : -Esto no puede estar pasando. De repente, escuchó varios sonido en su cabeza y Kara sufrió: -¡Mi cabeza! Segundos después, se concentró y escuchó: -¡Increíble!¡Este lugar es mágico!-el doctor se asombró -¿Qué has visto?- preguntó un soldado -Eso es como un zoólogico. Kara pensó: -¿Cómo estoy haciendo esto? Tengo que ir a mi cápsula. Mientras tanto el grupo de alumnos llegó a la sala y gritó al profesor. -Hemos descubierto algo.- expresó Ethan -¿Y el resto?- preguntó el Doctor -Hemos sido atacado por un especie de androide, mató a los soldados...- dijo Mary -... pero una joven nos rescató- siguió Billy. -¿Quién es esa chica?- preguntó Dr. Hamilton -Sea lo que sea, tenemos que capturarlo- comentó uno de los soldados -¡Es una niña!- respondió Mary En ese momento, apareció un monstruo gigante que rompió el cristal. -¡Atención, disparar!- uno de los militares dio una orden EL cuerpo de bicho era imprenetable, y con su más de 200 toneladas acabó con varios soldados. -Vamos, a morir- dijo Mary asustada Dr. Hamilton intentó escapar pero el rabo del ser le dejó inconsciente. El monstruo se acercó a los alumnos, su boca estaba abierta; pero cuando pensaron que iba a morir, Kara le agarró de la cola y lo aventó. -¿Acaba de lanzar ese ser de más de 200 toneladas como si nada?- espetó Ethan -Hay que llevar a un lugar seguro al Doctor- se desesperó Mary Mientras los alumnos llevaban a su profesor, la joven luchó contra el bicho. El bicho se lanzó pero Kara esquivó con facilidad y el monstruo chocó contra la pared. -Esto parece fácil- masculló la joven La cola del monstruo atrapó a la chica apretando su cuerpo, pero salió Billy para dispatar: -¡Eh, bicho asqueroso! Cuando el monstruo giró la cabeza, la Krypotiana se zafó, levantó el monstruo y lo tiró a la otra sala. El monstruo se cansó y abandonó el lugar Mientras los alumnos estaba con su profesor: -¿Cómo está ?- preguntó Billy -Está muy malherido, tenemos que llevarle a un hospital.- respondió Mary -Mira... allí- dijo Ethan El grupo volteó la cabeza y apareció segundos la joven; ellos no sabían que hacer pero finalmente se acercó e intentó hablar con ella: -Buenas... venimos en Sol de paz... yo me llamo Ethan... ella Mary... el otro es Billy; ¿cómo te llamas? - No hace falta que hables así, te entiendo perfectamente y soy la capitana -Kara Zor-El -¿Cómo?- espetó Mary -Tengo un traductor universal que pueda entender a cualquiera de toda la galaxia -¿Cómo has podido derrotar a ese monstruo?- preguntó Billy .Ese monstruo es un ser de las tierras grandes de Kandor y yo tampoco entiendo... de repente, me desperté y tengo una superfuerza y unos poderes sobrenaturales. -¿Eras tú de la cápsula?- preguntó Ethan -Sí, una pregunta; ¿cuántos tiempo llevo aquí? Esperaron varios segundos y finalmente Ethan respondió: -Mucho tiempo - Perdóname, por ser descortés pero tenemos que ayudar ... - comentó Mary -Os acompañaré, no puedo quedarme aquí hasta que me encuenten -Hay un problema, si te ven va a capturar- explicó Billy -Creo que tengo una idea- solucionó Ethan Ethan quitó la ropa militar de un soldado y ella sintió: -Tengo algo de respeto con los muertos. -Lo siento, pero no hay más remedio. La joven Kryptoniana se cambió de ropa y ésta dijo: -¿Cómo estoy? -Maravillosa- respondieron todos El grupo se llevó a Dr. Hamilton y llegó a la salida; en ese momento Kara se inclinó[Chapter 3] CAPÍTULO 3: La Salida -¿Qué te pasa, Kara?- preguntó Ethan -¡Mis ojos! De los ojos salieron una visión calorífica explotando varios vehículos haciendo varios soldados saliesen -¿Qué ha pasado? -¿Cómo han explotado? -¿Dónde están las motos? -¿Está bien,Kara?- preguntó Mary -Estoy bien -Vámonos,antes de que se den cuenta. El grupo se llevó al doctor a la enfermería -¿Qué le ha pasado?- preguntó el doctor -Hemos sido atacado- respondió Billy -¿ Y los demás? -Todos muertos- dijo Mary - Llevadle a una camilla- el doctor mandó para sanarlo Mientras curaba al doctor, los demás esperaron en un refugio -¿Cómo está?- preguntó Kara -Bien, sólo toca esperar- contestó Mary Ethan se acercó y le dieron varios vasos de chocolate caliente y le dijo a Kara: -Ten, esto para calentar un poco el cuerpo...Cuidado, no te queme. -¿Qué es? -Chocolate caliente. La joven sopló su vaso para enfriarlo pero descubrió que se había congelado. - Mejor que lo dejes- dijó Billy con sorna Llegó el general y gritó: -¿Qué ha pasado todos mis hombres a muerto?¿Y por qué está el doctor en la enfermería ? -Hemos sido atacado por seres de otros planetas...- explicó Mary -Los militares murieron y el pobre Doctor quedó inconsciente- siguió Ethan -Soldado,¿ por qué no tiene tu arma?- el general se dirigió a Kara - No tuvo remedio, tuvimos que salvarnos- Billy mintió para no descubrir -Que lo diga ella- dijo con un tono amenazante. La tensión se palpó en el ambiente y finalmente Kara respondió con tono firme: -Señor, no pudimos; las armas se quedaron sin munición. Segundos de tensión, pasaron y finalmente el General dijo -Vale, te creo. El general se marchó del lugar. -Creo que se lo ha creído- masculló Ethan -Te has manejado muy bien- Mary felicitó a la joven Kryptoniana. -Gracias; aprendí algunas técnicas militares en mi mundo. -¿Cómo es tu planeta?- preguntó Billy -Es un planeta encantador, tienes las bellas criaturas y unas bonitas vistas... El doctor entró y dijo: -Podeis entrar. Los chicos entraron y se encontraron con el y Mary comentó -Veo que estás bien -Sólo me ha dado un fuerte contusión...¿Cómo habeis salido del peligro? -Hemos tenido suerte.- respondió Billy -Veo que os acompaña alguien..¿Cómo se llama?-el Doctor preguntó mientras miraba a la Kryptoniana -Se llama Kara, ella nos ayudó a sacarnos de allí- contestó Ethan -Encantada-la joven extraterrestre saludó -Chicos, me teneís que llevar mi investigación al Instituto Nacional de Metrópolis mientras me recupero -Tranquilo, se la llevaremos-aceptó Mary Minutos más tardes Los soldados se llevaron los aparatos del Dr. Hamilton a un avión militar y un militar indicó: -Nos vamos en 5 minutos. -¿Iremos en esa máquina?- chilló Kara mientras sonaba el fuerte sonido del aparato - Tranquila, no pasará nada- Ethan intentó calmarla Los jóvenes entraron, se sentaron y se pusieron los cinturones pasaron varias horas mientras sobrevolaba en el cielo Más tarde, el avión sufrió unos problemas -¿Qué ocurre?- preguntó Mary asustada -No pasa nada, tal vez sea turbulencias- Billy intentó calmarla En el avión, explotaron uno de los motores. -¿Qué ocurre?- preguntó Kara asusta -Ha explotado unos de los motores- respondió uno de los soldados De repente, se abrió un boquete succionando al militar. -¡Dios mío!- se asustó Billy. Otro motor explotó y el aparato iba cayendo contra la cima de una montaña. Kara se quitó el cinturón y se acercó -¿Qué vas a hacer?- preguntó Ethan -Intentaré de frenar este cacharro- respondió la alienígena -¿Cómo? -Improvisaré. Salió al exterior por el agujero del techo, se acercó a unos motores que estaba ardiendo y lo enfrió. En un descuido, Kara resbaló y cayó desde 3000 metros en su momento pensó: -Yo voy a caer pero ellos van a morir, por mí culpa... No pienso hacerlo En ese momento Kara estaba volando y se aproximó al aparato Mientras tanto, en el avión, el piloto: -Tenemos un problema. Cuando el aparato iba contra la cima, llegó Kara, dobla la cola del avión haciendo que se dirigiese a un terreno sin explorar. Después saltó y se puso delante para frenar con su mano derecha. El cacharro se frenó en seco, dejando incosciente al piloto; segundos después arrancó la puerta que abría el avión militar y preguntó -¿Estais bien? -Estamos bien, no te preocupes.- respondió Mary -¿Cómo se encuentra el piloto?- preguntó Billy -Está bien,sólo una pequeña contusión- contestó Kara. Salieron para indagar el camino -¿Dónde estamos?- preguntó Billy -¡Je, que casualidad!- Ethan dijo con sarcasmo - estamos en Medville, en mi pueblo natal. Tengo allí mi casa. -¿Y qué pasa con los experimentos de ?- preguntó Mary -Creo que está bien, tengo un amigo cercano que los puede llevar. -Pero antes, tenemos que llevar al piloto al hospital- comentó Billy -Tranquilo, estoy bien- respondió el piloto que salió del avión- ¿Qué ha pasado, yo no pude manejar los mandos si no funcionaban? -Nada, será suerte del destino- ironizó Mary -¿No deberías ir al hospital?- preguntó Billy -Estoy bien, llamaré a mis superiores para saber mi posición- respondió el piloto -Vale, nosotros estaremos aquí. El grupo se marcharon y Ethan agradeció a Kara: -Gracias, por salvarnos. -No me las dé, ¿qué vamos hacer ahora? -Vamos a mi casa, a descansar y ya veremos.[Chapter 4] Una chica en La Tierra \"Diario de Bitácora: Han pasado 3 meses desde que me he despertado en este planeta con unos poderes sobrenaturales. He estado viviendo en la casa de Ethan, con Mary y Billy; los únicos amigos de este lugar. Investigué su historia, su música, sus costumbres y aprendí usar su idioma me parecen fascinante. No duermo,todavía sufro las pesadillas de la última vez que dormí y me ocupo entrenando mis poderes todas las noches Todavía no sé cuando volveré; he estado llamando varias veces pero aun no me responden... Espero que no hayan pasado nada\" En una noche Kara que esta vestida de una sudadera con capucha roja,camiseta blanca, un pantalón chándal azul y unos cascos puestos entró en una pequeña tienda y preguntó al depediente que era muy mayor. -¿Buenas, tienes una botella de bebida enegértica? -Claro,¿ cómo es que está tan tarde durante esta noches? -Hago un poco de ejercicio. -¿No es un poco peligroso? -Sé, cuidarme de mi misma -No lo dudo- dijó el depediente de una forma irónica- Son 1$ Unos segundos entraron unos criminales, interrumpiendo y grito uno de ellos: -¡Quieto todo el mundo!¡Tú, el viejo dame todo el dinero! -Sí, no tengo nada... Otros compinches le golpeó en la cabeza dejando incosciente para luego robar de la caja. -Pero, ¿qué haceís?- Kara gritó -Tranquila, muchacha, tu vienes conmigo- masculló otro de los criminales que se acercaba a la chica En ese momento, alzó el cuerpo del criminal para luego lanzarlo. -Veo que eres díficil- comentó otro de los criminales mientras sacó su navaja En ese momento, ella calentó el arma con visión calorífica haciendo que soltase la navaja y uno de ellos dijo: -¡Disparad! El grupo dispararon contra el cuerpo de la muchacha sin hacerle efecto. -Tenemos que salir- chilló uno de ellos. El grupo salieron de la tienda hacia un callejón oscuro donde estaba su coche, detrás suya seguía la Kryptoniana Uno de ellos le golpeo con la culata del arma contra su cabeza, pero solamente se rompió el arma y luego fue arrojado a un contenedor vacío de una patada. El resto se metieron en el coche y uno de ellos ordenó: -¡Atropelladle! El vehículo se lanzó contra la muchacha pero fue parado en seco, -¡Sigue dándole al pedal!- se desesperó uno de ellos -Lo estoy haciendo. Las ruedas se desgastaban con el fresno y finalmente se caló el motor del coche. Kara arrancó uno de las puertas y sacó a uno de ellos Los chavales salieron asustado, pero la joven atrapó a dos de ellos y los echó al contenedor vacío. Otro intentó atacar por la espalda pero fue zafado y lanzado, también al contenedor. Finalmente quedaba uno de ellos que se escapó pero la Kryptoniana , lo atrapó y se llevó a una azotea. La joven sostenía de la camiseta del criminal fuera del borde y éste preguntó asustado -¿Qué eres? -Sólamente una chica- respondió con un tono amenazante -¿Qué quieres? -Sólo un aviso... si veo algunos de vosotros, haciendo daño a alguien; no seré muy amable. Dejó al criminal en el suelo del edificio y rápidamente desapareció del lugar. Mientras en la tienda, el dueño se despertó del golpe y miró a Kara: -¿Estás bien? -Yo, bien...¿Cómo se encuentra usted? -Yo, bueno, con un pequeño golpe...¿Qué ha pasado? -Ellos destrozaron su tienda, pero yo me he ocupado de ellos... Siento, por el desastre y ten aquí tiene su dinero. -No te preocupes. Mientras Kara se preparaba para marchar, el dependiente exclamó: -¡Espera!... ¿Cómo lo conseguiste? -Ya le dijé;... sé cuidarme sóla- respondió con una sonrisa Al marcharse del lugar, se encontró con un edificio en llamas y en su interior se escuchó: -¡Socorro! Kara entró en el viejo rascacielos y en una habitación se encontró una mujer asustada y acorralada por el fuego. En ese momento, los escombros iban caer sobre encima de ella pero la Kryptoniana llegó para evitarlo y gritó: -¡Sal, si quieres vivir! La mujer dudó: -¿Cómo...? -Ahora eso no es importante, sal si no quieres morir. La mujer salió de la zona y Kara soltó los escombros. Después explicó a la mujer: - A su izquierda, está la escalera... -Mi hija está dentro... -Tranquila, yo me ocupo...¿cómo se llama su hija? -Se llama Jenny, sólo tiene 5 años. -La encontraré. La mujer saló del lugar mientras la joven seguía buscando y gritando: -¡Jenny! En una habitación, se escuchó una voz masculina gritando -¡Auxilio! Ella entró y vio un hombre en el rincón y en el suelo había una gran grieta. La joven Kryptoniana le explicó: -Es mejor que saltes... -No, puedo estoy asustado... El suelo se rescrabejó y el tío se cayó pero fue atrapado y subido con facilidad por la muchacha y preguntó: -¿Has visto una niña de 5 años? -Lo siento, no la he visto. -Marchése, a un lugar seguro Kara siguió buscando y llamando a la niña -¡Jenny! Usó su superoído y oyó a la niña llorando en una habitación. Kara entró en la sala y preguntó: -¿Eres Jenny? La niña no respondió porque estaba asustada y dijo -¿Mamá? La joven intentó calmarla: -Tranquila... tú madre estás a salvo, yo te puedo sacar aquí... La chiquilla dio unos pasos hacia atrás pero la chica insistió. -¿Estás asustada?... Yo también estuve, pero confía en mí, no te vas a pasar nada. Al final la niña aceptó y Kara cogió a la niña con cuidado y le pusó sus cascos: -Ten esto, así no escucharás nada... Y no mires... Salieron de la sala y se fueron a la escalera pero se derrumbó: -¡Maldición! - pensó negativamente Kara. Intentaron escapar por otra salida y sólamente había un montón de escombros. Miró, finalmente, a un pasillo y preguntó a la niña: -¿Confías en mí? La niña asistió. Ambas salieron por la ventana entre las llamas y aterrizaron en la calle. La madre vio a ambas y espetó de alegría: -¡Jenny! -¡Mamá! Ambas se reencontraron y la madre preguntó: -¿Cómo puedo agredecerte por lo que has hecho? Pero finalmente desapareció la alienígena, antes de llegar los bomberos. Más tarde, llegó a la casa de Ethan y entró por la puerta del jardín; en ese momento se encontó con sus amigos -¿Dónde has estado?- Ethan preguntó con un tono de enfado. -Nada, sólamente he estado un tiempo a fuera. -¿Qué te has pasado la ropa?- preguntó Mary -Nada, complicaciones. -¿Qué clase de complicaciones?- preguntó Billy -Nada, importante. -¿Te han visto alguien?- preguntó Ethan seriamente -Bueno... me han visto pero no me quedaba más remedio -¿Sabes que no estás poniendo en serio peligro? -Lo siento..., pero no tenía remedio; ¿ que quería que muriese? -Tienes razón- expresó Ethan ahora en voz calmada- pero si la gente te viese estaríamos en serio peligro. -Sé, que estaís en peligro por mi... pero, tranquilos, yo no pondré en peligro... -De todo modo, es mejor ocultar tu identidad...- comentó Mary En ese momento salió Billy e indicó a los chicos. -Chicos, el nos ha llamado para que mañana vayemos al Instituto de Metrópolis. -¿Por qué motivo?- preguntó Mary -Algo sobre Krypton.. -Si es sobre Krypton, iré con vosotros...- respondió Kara -Vale, saldremos por la mañana- explicó Ethan - Y Kara, ..te ayudaré en el asunto de tu identidad...- dijo Mary Los jóvenes se fueron a su cuarto a descansar, menos Kara que estaba observando el paisaje por la ventana[Chapter 5] Capítulo 5: Descubrimiento El grupo llegó al instituto en un coche -Creo que este es el lugar- comentó Ethan Salieron del coche y entre ella estaba la joven Kryptoniana que iba con una pequeña minifalda negras, unos tacones negros,una camisa blanca con chaqueta negra ,unos anteojos y una peluca morena y tuvo una pequeña queja: -No me agrada mucho llevar minifalda y con estos tacones. -Es un poco incómodo, pero te puede acostumbrar- Mary respondió con una pequeña sonrisa Entraron en el Instituto Nacional y se acercaron al recibidor de Información, en ella estaba una mujer cuya etiqueta ponía Linda. -Buenas, teníamos una cita con el Doctor Hamilton- dijo Ethan -Sí, está en la 3ª planta, a la derecha Ambos fueron a la sala, llamaron a la puerta. -¡Adelante!- dijó el Dr. Hamilton. -Somos nosotros- habló Ethan -Puede pasar Entraron en la sala y entre ellos había un montón de origén Kryptoniano -Buenas, señor Hamilton. Hemos venido porque nos ha llamado- saludó Ethan -Sí, es verdad...Os he llamado porque sé algo más. Mientras Dr. Hamilton explicaba miraba sus reliquias. -Sé que proviene de un planeta muy lejos de nuestra galaxia,... tenía una tecnología superior de este planeta.. Mientras miró en una caja de plomo -Cuidado, no toques eso -¿Por qué es frágil?- preguntó Mary Kara abrió la caja y de repente se puso enferma: -¡Kara!- gritaron los compañeros Los compañeros le ayudaron y ella musitó -La roca... Resultó que era una Kryptonita, Billy rápidamente guardó en la caja.. -¿Estás bien?- preguntó . -Sólo un poco de mareo.- Kara mintió mientras se recuperaba siguió: -El planeta estaba cerca de un Sol rojo... -¿Dónde está ese planeta?- preguntó Ethan -Estaba... -¿Cómo ?-Espetó Kara con gran asombro -Hace millones de años que fue destruido... La Kryptoniana mostraba cara de tristeza -¿Qué te ocurre?- preguntó Ethan -Nada, sólamente quiero esta un minuto a solas.- se marchó un lugar pensando en los momentos duros como la muerte de su amigo enKrypon ** FLASHBLACK ** En Krypton, se celebró el funeral de Kneel , estaban sus familiares y amigos y entre elllos estaba Kara y su familia. Ella sintió tristeza y dio el pésame a sus padres. -Siento mucho, lo que pasó...Tenía que haberle rescatado y no pude La madre de Knee lepusó la manoen el rostro yde KAra y tranquilizó: -Hiciste lo que pudiste,te agradecemos por intentarlo En ese momento El Cura recitó: Kneel fue un joven aventurero que tomó un horrible descelance. Le echaremos de menos Llevaron el cuerpo del joven a una pila funeraria y quemaron su cadaver: **FIN DE FLASHBACK** En la actualidad Los amigos de Kara estaban en la calle buscando a ella - ¿Dónde Kara - Preguntas Ethan desesperada -Dentro del edificio dijeron que no se encontraba- respondió Mary -¿Por qué nos separamos y a lo mejor está a los alrededores?- sugirió Billy -Tal vez, sea buena idea.- aceptó Ethan El trío se separaron a buscar a Kara y MAry entró en un callejón sin salida. De repente, se levantaron varios individuos -Perdona, me he equivocado- dijo Mary que se dio medio vuelta. -¿Por qué huyes sino te vamos a hacer nada?-masculló unos de los hombres Ellos se acercaron hacia la muchacha. -¡No os acercaís a ella!- gritó una voz muy familiar que resultó ser de Kara. -¿Otra muchacha? ES nuestro día de suerte- expresó el otro criminal mientras se acercaba a ella La joven le dio una patada que le lanzó contra la pared Los compañeros del criminal se asombraron, pero uno de ellos agarró una barra de hierro y le golpeó contra la cabeza de la chica sin causarle efecto. -¿Pero qué? Recibio otra patada igual que la de su compañero -Mejor me voy ...- masculló el criminal que quedaba Kara agarró del cuello y masculló: -¡Tú no vas a escapar, casi iba a hacer daño a mi amiga! -Lo siento, no sabía que era tu amiga. Los ojos de Kara estaba encendidos -¡No, Kara, no lo hagas!- gritó Mary La Kryptoniana no reaccionó pero su amiga insistió: -Kara, entiendo lo que está pasando... pero si lo haces perderás a tus amigos. La alienigena soltó al hombre y ordenó: -Vete de aquí y llevate a tus amigos. El criminal se llevó a sus amigos del lugar Ethan y Billy llegaron al lugar y Ethan preguntó -¿Que ha pasado aquí? María le contesto: -Kara me salvó de unos criminales. La joven kryptoniana se disculpó -Siento que os preocupeis por mi y no quise daño a vosotros... -No tiene que pedir disculpas... Te entendemos- Billy intentó calmar Mary intentó animarla y sugirió -¿Qué tal hacemos una cosa? Un noche de chicas, tú y yo -No quiero ser un incordio - Tranquila, Kara... Nosotros iremos a la casa en tren, vosotras podreís coger el coche- Ethan le dio las llaves a Mary y ambos grupos se separaron[Chapter 6] Capítulo 6: Una noche de chicas \"Diario de Bitácora. Mi mundo ha sido destruido, todo lo que había creido se fue como dice en este planeta : \"Al Desagüe\". No me queda nada de mi hogar, tendré que empezar una vida. Mary intenta con buena intención animarme pero eso no cura en un día...\" En una heladería Kara y Mary quería hablar a solas mientras pidieron helados. Un camarero le atendía -¿Qué quereís? -Yo quiero un helado de Brownnie y,¿tú... Linda?-Mary pidió primera -Yo quiero un helado de 3 sabores- repondió Kara -Vale, enseguida se lo damos- el camarero se encargó de sus pedidos Mientras las chicas charlaron. -¿Cómo te sientes ?- preguntó Mary -Sola- respondió tristemente Kara -¿Por qué lo dices? -Mi planeta ... ha sido destruido y si había alguna esperanza de que alguien de mi planeta, ya lo he perdido -Puedes que hayas perdido tu mundo, pero ahora puedes crear otro nuevo El camarero linterrumpió y le entregó los helados en la mesa. -Sus helados. -Gracias- agradeció Mary Mientras en otro lugar En unas excavaciones unos obreros estaban haciendo unas obras cuando uno de ellos llamó a su capataz -Jefe,hemos encontrado algo -¿Qué es?-preguntó el capataz -Ven y acercase El capataz y varios empleados se acercaron una vaina y de ella salió una mano... Mientras en la carretera En el coche circularon Mary y Kara por la carretera y la joven Kryptoniana agradeció: -Gracias Mary -¿Por qué? -Por ser mi vida mejor En ese momento se pararon en medio de un control -¿Perdona, qué esta pasando?- preguntó Mary a un guardia -Nada, grave. En seguida, les atiendo- contestó el guardia Kara observó a un guardia hablando por el Walkie-Talkie y escuchó con su superoído -Sí, tenemos la nave...¿La chica? Está aquí. Cuando oyó le bisbiseó a su amiga: -Mary, pase lo que pase no salgas del coche La joven salió del coche y uno de las guardias le indicó: -¡Alto! Ella agarró del brazo y lo aventó, después otro guardia intentó disparar pero una patada lo expulsó del lugar -No te muevas, te llevamos buscando tiempo...-ordenó otro guardia que le apuntó con su arma Cuando por detrás, le golpeó con una pequeña tabla en la cabeza dejando incosciente -¿Qué es lo que está pasando?-preguntó Mary -Es mi culpa... no tenía que pasar-respondió Kara -¿Qué hacemos con ellos? -Tengo una idea La Kryptoniana cogió los parachoques , los ató y dejó unas instrucciones -Si se mueven, apunta... -¿Tú que vas a hacer? -Arreglar las cosas-Kara se marchó rápidamente a la casa. En la casa Un grupo de militares estaban sacando del sótano -Sacad con cuidado- ordenó de los militares Kara llegó y dio una orden a ello: -Dejad lo que no es vuestro, sino quereís sufrir las consecuencias -¡Es ella!- gritó uno de los militares Tiraron una red sobre la alienígena y descargaron una carga eléctrica arrodillando el cuerpo de la Kryptoniana -Os avisé- masculló Kara Rompió la red con facilidad y se acercó directamente -¡Cogedla!- gritó uno de los militares. Con su pierna derecha, dió una patada a uno de los militares rompiendo una de las después, otro soldado intentó atraparla pero un codazo rompió la entrada. -¡A la mierda!- gritó otro soldado. Él disparó una ráfaga de balas contra ella pero no le hizo efecto, después la chica le envió un gancho atravesando la puerta del jardín. Más tarde, alguien arrojó una bomba de humo, la alienígena estaba tosiendo del humo. Un grupo de soldados rodearon a la chica pero se escuchó varios golpes -¿Cómo?- espetó El humo se disipó pero no había nadie y Kara avisó al soldado: -¡Aquí! El soldado ojeó al techo y estaba Kara que con su puño noqueó al militar. Después escuchó la voz de Mary gritando: -Kara Salió al exterior y vio a su amiga dentro de un coche -Mary- gritó Kara desesperada Corrió hacia un árbol y la lanzó contra la carretera, el conductor descontroló y provocó un accidente. -¡Mary! Llegó al vehículo y arrancó una de las puertas y resultó que era un honograma. El conductor del vehículo se despertó, la Kryptoniana enfadada atrapó y frunció su ceño: -¡Dime dónde están mis amigos! -Cree que tienes el derecho a mandarme- le respondió Ella destrozo la mano con su fuerza -¡Tienes otros 205 huesos, sigue así y te quedara ninguno! -Vale, te lo diré. Le enseñó la tarjeta y Kara agradablemente congeló la mano destrozada: -¿Por qué me ayudas?- espetó el militar -A pesar de lo que me habeis hecho, siempre veo algo de bondad en las personas... Después se marchó del lugar[Chapter 7] Capítulo 7: El Rescate \"Es mi culpa, mis acciones cometieron que mis amigos fueron capturados. Corregiré para no cometer el mismo error como con Kell\" * Flashback* La joven estaba sóla llorando en su habitación cuando Allura entró: -¿Estás bien, hija? -Sí, lo estoy- mintió Kara -Sé que no me estás diciendo la verdad... Te conozco -Debí haber desconfiado Dev-Em , no tendría que dejar sólo a Kell... -Tú no tienes la culpa...Lo intentaste -Lo intenté... pero no lo conseguí... -A veces, no puede conseguir todo lo que pueda pero es bonito ayudar a los demás... Mira, Kara, sino quieres ir al funeral te entiendo. -No, iré.. Lo haré por sus padres *Fin de Flashback* La joven Kryptoniana estaba escondida y camuflada con una sudadera roja en un recinto bien vigilado y pensó: -Tengo que provocar una distracción Llegó en seguida un camión en medio de una barrera. -Tengo que dejar en el almacén- dijo al camionero al guardia -Ya lo tengo-pensó para ella misma Los rayos caloríficos derritieron los neumáticos -¡Mierda!- espetó el conductor -¿Qué ha ocurrido ?- preguntó el vigilante -Se me han reventado los neumáticos -Tal vez algún compañero le pueda ayudar El vigilante y el camionero se marcharon del lugar, mientras la joven aprovechó para robar la tarjeta del vigilante. Más tarde, entró con la tarjeta en el almacén y un vigilante observó vió a la chica y llamó a su compañero que el vigilante de la barrera y preguntó: -¿Sí? -¿Dejaste a una chica rubia entrar? -No, ¿por qué? -Porque está adentro En una sala aparte , Kara entró en la sala y vió su traje Kryptoniano en tubo cristalizado Un soldado preguntó a un científico -¿Qué tenemos? -El traje tiene un tejido irrompible y tiene una elasticidad increíble... En ese momento, interrumpió noqueando al militar y ella dijo: -No quiero hacerle daño, pero, por favor dime ¿dónde está mis amigos? -No te lo puedo decir...-respondió asustado el científico Después explotaron unas probetas vacías y la Kryptoniana tenía los ojos encendidos -Mira, friki, me molesta que tú me estés tocando mis cosas... A la siguiente, te carbonizo la cabeza... Mientras los vigilantes y militares llegaron a la puerta. -Dicen que la chica es peligrosa. -No debemos dañarla Cuando ella entró no había nadie ,sólo estaba la sala destruida , el militar malherido y el científico sin ningún rasguño. Kara busco la puerta donde estaba sus amigos cuando un vigilante le llamó la atención: -¡Alto! Ella dio una patada que atravesó otra puerta. -¡Maldición!- espetó la Kryptoniana Los vigilantes y militares llegaron y ordenó: -¡Estáte quieta! -Sólo quiero saber estar mis amigos- respondió Kara con las manos mientras se acercaba. Uno de ellos, le disparó sin sufrirle daño alguno. -Veo que no me queda remedio Ella sopló un aliento derribando a ellos. Un vigilante corrió hacia la chica pero se topó con el brazo que le hizo caer. Ellos dispararon contra ella sin hacerle,ella poco a poco lo derrotó. Uno agarró por detrás pero ella se zafó volando chocando los cuerpos contra el techo. Después otro la agarró por delante, pero se libró de una patada. Por último, dos vigilantes estaban de frente, uno de ellos intentó agarrar a la chica de acero pero ella noqueó estampando su cabeza contra el techo y con su mano derecha expulsó al otro vigilante. Cuando terminó, entró en la sala pero por sorpresa, había Kryptonita. La chica no sabía que pasaba y se desmayó en la sala.[Chapter 8] Capítulo 8: Revelaciones y preparaciones Kara se despertaba de un habitación sentada cerrada con varios vigilantes y una mesa delante suya: -Malditos, estais contento, teneís mis amigos y mis cosas. Y encima me teneis atrapada.- se mostró enfandada con los puños apretados En ese momento entró una mujer y dijo: -Debería calmarse, señorita Kara -¿Quién eres ? ¿Cómo sabe mi nombre? -Soy Tess Mercer... Te hemos están espiando- respondió mientras se sentaba -¿Qué habeis hecho con mis amigos? -Tus amigos está bien... Sabes has sido una buena rival para mis mejores hombres -¿Mejores hombres? ¿Entonces cómo serían los peores?- ironizó la joven -Necesitamos su ayuda...Tú entiendes las cosas de tu planeta -¿ Y si me niego? La señora le enseñó unas fotos: -Estas fotos fueron sacado de una gasolinera... ¿Recuerdas que asustate a unos criminales? ¿Qué pasaría si le enseñó estas imágenes a la prensa? Los militares te atraparían y te encerraría en el Área 41. La chica miró las fotos y se lo pensó -¿ Y bien?- preguntó Tess -Lo haré... pero cuando esto termine, me dejareís en paz. -Acepto el trato. Más tarde Tess explicó a Kara: -En el desierto de Nuevo México estaba construyendo una fábrica de LexCorp pero después fue destruido -¿Y eso qué tiene ver conmigo? -Esto lo que se ha descubierto entre los restos. En la foto apareció una cápsula como de Kara -¿ Y qué opinas?- preguntó Tess -Tal vez tenga que ir a investigar. Minutos después: En otra habitación, unos científicos explicaron a Kara: -Hemos mejorado dado un poco de color a su traje, y el tejido de tu trjae hemos creado una minifalda. La chica de acero se lo probó en una habitación aparte y después salió -¿Entonces te gusta?-preguntó uno de los científicos -Me encanta, gracias, me hizo recodar a mi planeta- respondió Kara con lágrimas en la cara -Lo siento.. no quería- -No te preocupes... -Señorita Kara, ¿hay gente que viene a verle? En la otra habitación estaban sus amigos: -¡Ethan, Mary, Billy!¡Estais bien!- la joven mostró su alegría dando un abrazo. - Estamos bien... pero si te importa nos está asfixiando- balbuceó Ethan -Lo siento- Kara soltó a sus amigos y se disculpó- ¿Creía que os habia hecho daño? -Eso creíamos.. pero nos explicó lo que pasaba- respondió Mary -Nos dijo que tendría descrubir por tí misma- siguió Billy En un cambio de tema, Ethan comentó: -Me gusta tu traje. -Gracias... Me lo mejoraron.. -¿Qué vas a hacer ahora?-preguntó Billy -Voy a hacer una misión... -¿Una misión? ¿Eres demasiada joven?- espetó Mary -En verdad soy una anciana... pero tranquilo que cuando esto termine, me quedaré con vosotros Un vigilante interrumpió la reunión: -Kara, es la hora - Voy. El vigilante se marchó y Ethan murmuró: -Cuídate. -Tranquilo lo haré En el hángar Tess le explicó la misión a la joven que estaba en un avión militar: -Tiene que ir a observar que es lo que ocurrió allí -¿ Y por qué tengo que ir con tus vigilantes?-preguntó Kara - Ellos te ayudarán en la misión, si tiene problemas -Los \"problemas\" que tú dices no están preparados El vigilante interrumpió: -Tess, es la hora -Vale, Kara tengo que irme El avión despegó de la zona y se fue a su destino[Chapter 9] Capítulo 9:En Nuevo México/ \" Diario de Bitácora:He recibido mi primera misión en la Tierra...parece que no er la única en salir de la nave y me necesitan\" La chica estaba sentado en el avión miliar rodeada de soldados y parloteaban -Jason, vamos a ver la tumba de E.T ¿ qué te parece? -Genial,Matt, si acabamos lo buscamos Kara se molestó y dijo: -No es divertido reirse de los muertos Jason se disculpó: -Lo siento, Kara, ¿te has creído que es real? -Si, sentimos, haberte ofendido por haber confundido unos cartuchos de videojuego con un cuerpo.. -¿Videojuego?- espetó Kara Sí, resulta que era un videojuego tan malo que enterraron los restos del cartuchos en el desierto- explicó Jason -Provocando la caída de los videojuegos. de 1984.. pero gracias a Nintendo se recuperó la idea- siguió Matt -Interesante... no me había enterado de esa historia y eso que he estado 3 meses en La Tierra.. Más tarde Ellos llegaron a su destino y Matt preguntó: -¿Y bien?¿Qué hacemos? -Ireís a investigar y si veis algún superviviente. Advisadme.- explicó Kara El grupo se repeló para investigar y ella usó su visión de rayos X para encontrar un superviviente entre los hierros quitó los objetos y ordenó al grupo: -Aquí hay uno. -¿Eres amiga del hombre? -pregunto el tío asustado. -¿Qué hombre? -Era un hombre alto, grande, tenía una mano como recuerdo y una capa.. La chica recordó quien era y dijo al hombre: -No es mi amigo...Él también me hizo daño. Los militares se llevaron al tío al avión y uno de ellos descubrió algo inquientante. Él se acercó y vio una mano pero alguien de entre las sombras le acechó -¿Qué ocurre, Kara?- preguntó Matt -Estoy preocupada... pienso que ya sé quien és- respondió Kara En ese momento, se escuchó un grito de dolor, corrieron para averiguar y descubrieron el cuerpo descuartizado del soldado: -Por aquí, ha pasado un trolebús- espetó Jason -¡Atención, esté atentos!- Kara dio una oren Los soldados se colocaron alrededor de la Kryptoniana, pero rápidemente desaparecieron.. -¿Tú?- masculló Kara -Veo que no era el único en sobrevivir-masculló un voz masculina Era Dev-Em vivo pero esta asombrado y ella le recriminó: -¿Qué haces aquí? La última vez que recuerdo es que mataste a mi tripulación -Recuerdasque dije que quería tener Kryptonianos -Sí... Yo te respondí que no te dejaría.. -Pues, para ti necesito el aparat o pero no lo tengo.. -Por suerte, para la humanidad es mejor.. No creas...cuando me desperté, soy más fuerte y rápido que nunca...Este mundo será mío gracias a Rao.. La chica le envió un puñetazo que atravesó una pared y masculló: -El mundo no es de nadie y no te permitiré que esté a tu mercé.. Él espetó: -¿Tú también tienes superfuerza?... Yo te acabaré contigo Dev-Em se lanzó contra Kara y juntos aterrizaron en una zona petrolífira del desierto. -ES innevetibale que caiga el planeta en mis manos ni tú ni nadie...- siguió Dev-Em mientras golpeaba en la cara de la joven -Eso hay que verlo-replicó Kara Ella de una patada le lanzó destrozando contra la máquina que estaba apunto de caerse sobre la gente pero ella lo atrapó y exigió: -Por favor, corred. La gente huyeron yentre los escombros, Dev-Em golpeó con una viga contra ella que cayó en un camión de gasolina. Ella se levantó , elevó, agarro el vehículo y estalló. Su enemigo no le resultó dañino para él y espetó -¿Vuelas? ¿Pero Cómo? -Con mucho entrenamiento y concentración Ella le dió un golpe haciendo que cayese en un tubo de plomo, él agarró el tubo y dijo: -Es hora de acabar con esto -Lo mismo digo. La chica derritió con sus rayos caloríficos el tubo cayendo la sustancia sobre él y después con su aliento helado lo congeló.. En un intercomunicador: -Kara, repota: -Vuelvo a la base... Tenemos que hablar, Tess. Dio unos pequeños pasos y descubrió un cartucho de juego de E.T ,se lo llevó y después se marchó. Dev-Em estaba neutralizado pero sacó una mano[Chapter 10] Capítulo 10: En Brasil Tess discutió con la joven de acero en una base: -Kara, ¿qué demonios ha ocurrido? Tus compañeros han desaparecido y ...¿qué demonios es eso? -Es una reliquia de este planeta... Me he topado con un viejo conocido -¿Y cuál es el plan? -Su deseo es injertar varios Kryptonianos... pero necesitas la llave para cumplir sus deseos. -¿ Y sabes dónde está? -Mi amigo está paralizado en Nuevo México, conociendo como es mi cuerpo , creo que está vivo y la llave´me dijo que cayó cuando aterrizó en este planeta. -¿Habrá algún modo de encontrarlo? -No sé, pero usaré con mis poderes para investigarlo -Creo, que no hace falta..-interrumpió un científico -¿Por qué?-preguntó Tess -Porque según mis informes, parece que había caído un trozo de la nave en Las Amazonas -¿Amazonas?¿En Brasil?-espetó Kara -Yo tengo un compañero que nos puede ayudar- comentó Tess -Se llama Paolo y trabaja para mí en los asuntos de Brasil -Gracias... Más tarde Kara habló por teléfono con Ethan: -¿Qué te vas a Brasil?- espetó Ethan -Sí, así es... -¿Sabes que es un sitio conflictivo? -Sí,... pero ellos deben preocuparse por mí -Me he enterado lo de Nuevo México... Siento que te haya encontrado con un viejo amigo -Ese no es mi amigo y debo hacerlo para que nadie lo pueda hacerlo por su propio interés.. -Dicen que tienes una reliquia -Si tengo el videojuego de E.T , cuando terminé la misión te lo puedo entregar. -Gracias, tendré que coger mi vieja Atari para jugarlo -Buenos, te dejo... Kara estaba en el cielo sobrevolando mientras en la calle de Brasil un chico estaba caminando cuando un camión estaba a punto de atropellarlo llegó rápidamente. La joven con su supervelocidad sacó al chaval del peligro. -Tranquilo, te he salvado la vida.- Kara intentó calmarle -Muchas gracias- agradeció el chaval con un perfecto inglés -¿Hablas inglés? -Sí,¿tú debes ser Kara? -¿Y tú Paolo? -Sí... Tess me dijo que una chica \"especial\" quiere que le ayude -Sí es verdad, te explicaré todo por el camino Mientras las instalaciones de Tess Los amigos interrumpió en una sala -Tenemos que hablar..- entró Ethan sobresaltado -Déjanos hablar a solas-Tess ordenó a su empleado-¿Qué ocurre? -¿Por qué mandó a una joven a un sitio tan peligroso?- preguntó Ethan en plan cabreado -No está sola, tengo a alguien que la acompaña ... Y además, ella es bastante fuerte para esos peligros.. -Por eso, queremos que nosotros queremos estar en la misión- contestó Mary -¿Estaís seguros, es un sitio peligroso? -Seguros al 100 x 100. En Amazonas La Kryptoniana y el brasileño estaban navegando en una barca a motor mientras ella escaneaba el lugar -¿Así que todo es todo es por una llave..? -Esa \"llave\" puede que destroza este planeta si lo coge en malas manos... De repente, la chica observó algo que la llamó la atención -Para aquí Paolo se acercó a la orilla, se adentró un poco más adentro y era un trozo de la nave enterrada. Ella la sacó del subsuelo y lo dejó al lado -¿Es esa tu nave?-preguntó Paolo -Sí... ha pasado durante mucho tiempo,sólo está un poco dañada Entraron en la nave y Kara empezó a recordar: -Aquí, recuerdo, todo lo que estaba en la nave... -Recuerda de qué tenemos que buscar una \"llave\".. -Sí, es cierto.. Kara y Paolo indigaron por el camino cuando en el asiento del capitán tenía un mensaje. Ella pulsó el botón y estaba su madre Allura: -Kara, si recibe este mensaje... estaré muerta. En Krypton, está teniendo un problema grave y tu tío y tu padre está intentando salvar el planeta Un guardia Kryptoniano interrumpió: -Allura, es la hora.. -Si, un momento, recuerda Kara siempre será una Zor-El El video terminó y la chica estaba en tus lágrimas y el brasileño preguntó: -¿Estás bien? -Sí -¿Es esa tu madre? -Seguimos buscando- interrumpió la conversación Más adelante, Paolo tropezó con un objeto y llamó a la alien: -¡Kara! Ella llegó rápidamente y Paolo le preguntó: -¿Es esta cosa? -Haga lo que haga, no toque con agua.. Paolo guardó el objeto envuelto y guardado en una mochila. Ambos acabaron y salieron pero se toparon con una tribu apuntando con su lanza[Chapter 11] Capítulo 11: Con las tribus El líder de la tribu les hablaba: - Whaka jekeaa uka (No entiendo el lenguaje amazónico) -Perdonad, pero no os entiendo nada- Kara espetó -Tranquilo, yo te puedo ayudar- respondió Paolo -¿Sabes hablar su idioma? -Sí, mis abuelos fueron parte amazónicos El líder y el chaval traducía: -Dicen que ¿por qué le atacamos su tierra? -Diles que no quiero atacarles, sólo estoy aquí para recuperar Otro índigena replicó y la traducción de Paolo: -Dicen que somos las personas que destrozaron nuestro poblado -¿Qué personas? En ese momento, varias máquinas destrozaban el bosque. Una de ellas eran una excavadora que se topó delante de un niño de la tribu, abrió la boca pero Kara lo bloqueó y destrozo la máquina. Un buldozer siguió destruyendo pero la Kryptoniana paró en seco, el conductor salió para golpearla pero ella lanzó su gancho derecho. Varios obreros iban armados, dispararon a la joven pero no la hizo daño. Ella con sus movimientos y rápidez noqueó a los trabajadores. Acto seguido, agarró a uno de ellos y amenazó: -Nombre para quien trabajas... -Trabajamos para el gobernador, él nos dijo que talemos y que ocupemos de los indígenas -Ahora, quiero que te vayas y si encuentro algunas de esas máquinas, acabará mucho peor y no querrás saberlo Dejó escapar y la tribu se acercarón hacia ella y la felicitaron por ayudarles \"Diario de Bitácora: Hoy me he encontrado con una de las tribus más antiguas de este planeta, no conocen la tecnología que fueron avances ni idiomas. Todo lo que he sentido es paz, me recordó unos días en Krytpon... **Flashback** Un Kryptoniano índigena corrió por la selva pero se encontró armado con una especie de escopeta espacial y armadura, éste apuntó con su arma -¿Qué ocurre ?- gritó una voz femenina -Tenemos un intruso- el Kryptoniano respondió -¿Quién es?- preguntó Thara -No sé, pero haré hablar- el Krytponiano levantó al índigena y amenazó-¡ Responde !¿Quién eres? -No tolero que trate así, te ordeno que le deje en paz- Kara ordenó a su compañero armado -Lo siento, capitana, corrió y se chocó delante mía Kara se acercó al indígena y dijo: -Perdonad, por mi amigo, es un maleducado, ¿por qué corrías? De repente, un monstruo gigante con escamas y plumas apareció de repente -Knell, llévate a los demás- Kara dió una orden a su novio -¿Qué vas hacer ?- preguntó Knell -Sólo necesito un arma...dame tu arma- ordenó al Kryptoniano armado que le dió su arma sin rechistar Ella distrajo con la escopeta y llamó la atención de la criatura. Corrieron por la selva hasta que ella vio un precipicio, la joven se lanzó y el monstruo la siguió ambos cayeron -¡Kara!- todos espetaron -Lo siento, Kara, ha sido una buena capitana y una buena amiga.. -Todavía no debeís de echarme de menos- gritó una voz familiar La capitana estaba agarrada una roca y siguió: -No debeís quedar mirando y dadme una cuerda. Le lanzaron una cuerda, ella lo agarró y subió mientras sus amigos les ayudaban. El índigena dio un abrazo: -No te preocupes, todo paso. .. Nosotros te llevaremos a tu casa **Fin de Flashback** Un grupo de mercenarios ( el conductor afroméricano, un chaval joven, un caucásico de 30 años y musculoso, y unamujer armada) se acercaron y mientras hablaban parloteaban -Es hora un poco de juerga -Dicen que una chica es peligrosa -Sí, es peligrosa...Yo me ocuparé de ella- respondió una chica armada Unos indígenas estaban en la zona y el conductor masculló: -¿Podreís practicar un poco? -Tiene razón, mejor practiquemos El grupo de mercenarios acribillaron contra los miembros de la tribu pero se toparon con la Kryptoniana que paró con su cuerpo las balas. -¿Es ella?- espe´to el chaval -¿Paró sus balas con su cuerpo?- se asombró el conductor -Pues utilizamos artillería pesada- la mujer cogió un lanzamisiles y le arrojó un cohete contra ella Le alcanzó un cohete pero de la humareda apareció la joven sin ningún rasguño -¡¿Qué?!- espetaron todos La Kryptoniana corrió , arrancó la puerta y sacó al conductor Salió el músculoso con su lanzallamas lanzado fuego pero ella congeló, y dio un gancho izquierdo -¡Maldita perra! ¡Te mataré!- exclamó la mujer que se lanzó con dos katanas La alien esquivaba con rápidez hasta cansar a la mujer y un con sólo golpe de dedo, le lanzó lejos. El joven intentó escapar pero se topó con Kara y masculló: -No te escapes, sólo quiero hacer unas preguntas. Más tarde: El gobernador y el empresario parloteaban: -¿Crees que podrá acabar con la chica? Señor Gobernador -No creo que sea un gran problema De repente, se escuchó un grito: -¡Socorro! Era Kara que tenía al joven mercenario atrapado y le lanzó entrando por la después ella también entró. -Veo que tú eres la joven que has trastocado los planes- comentó el gobernador Kara no hablaba pero escuchaba al político. -Hablamos con mal pie, tal vez piensa que soy un capullo, pero eso puede remediar El empresario le entrega un maletín con dinero y el gobernador le enseñó un fajo de billetes y siguió: -No creo que me negará, esto puede recompesarte...Además podrá comprar zapatos y vestiditos El fajó de billetes fue quemado por los ojos de Kara y ella replicó: -¿No te das vergüenza? Destroza las casas por dinero Mientras Kara estaba hablando con el político, el empresario intentó escapar por la puerta de atrás pero la joven lo atrapó: -¡Alto ahi!- indicó Kara que lanzó al americano contra una silla- Tú también está detrás de esto - A mi no me asustas por ser muy peligrosa, yo tengo el poder - contestó el gobernador -¿Crees en eso?-Kara preguntó con ironía Ella se acercó a una figura y con su mano pulverizó la estatua cuyo interior había una cámara -¿Qué es eso?- preguntó el gobernante con incredulidad -Es una cámara, mientras vosotros haceís planes, me ocupé de poner cámaras \"prestadas\" por una amiga -¿Crees que me puede chantajear, maldita yanki asquerosa? -No, creo. Pero puedo enviar este vídeo por las redes sociales tus votantes te rechazarán y los periodistas se acercarán hacia tí y perseguirá por toda tu patética vida En ese momento el político, no tenía mas argumentos y preguntó: -¿Qué quiere que haga ? -O bien o dimite y dejas de molestar a la tribu o hac lo que plazca mientras tus votantes vean el video. La joven de acero salió por la ventana mientras el político brasileño pensaba con sus pensamientos Media hora más tarde Kara estaba sentada con el resto de la tribu y Paolo dijo: -Veo las noticias que el gobernador dimitió por asuntos personales...¿Tienes algo que ver? -Me alegro que haya tenido una buena decision Una niña de la tribu se acercó, dijo algo a Kara y la Krytoniana preguntó: -¿Qué dice? -Te pregunta ¿por qué eres tan poderosa? -Dile porque entreno todos los días La niña se marchó con una pequeña sonrisa. El jefe de la tribu habló con el resto de la tribu y Kara y Paolo se levantaban y la chica preguntó: -¿Qué ocurre? -Creo que es una reunión- respondió Paolo El jefe habló mientras el chaval explicaba -Queridos hermanos y hermanas, los hombres de la ciudad no molestará mas y gracias por los espirítus que nos dío a su Diosa por habernos ayudarnos con su presencia. -Gracias, pero no me considero ninguna Diosa- respondió la alienígena que a su vez el brasileño lo tradujo Un miembro le dijo algo y Paulo tradujo: -Además es modesta Pero en ese momento, los árboles se desplomaban y miembros de la tribu se prepararon pero unos rayos caloríficos quemó uno de ellos., Kara uso su aliento helado para enfriarlo y espetó: -No puede ser Era Dev-Em y estaba furioso -¿Qué haces aquí Dev-Em, no te había detenido?- preguntó Kara con sorpresa -Las noticias vuelan, Kara... Escuché que has estado molestando a varias personas Kara susurró a Paolo: -Llévate, a la gente de aquí El brasileño se llevó a la tribu del lugar,mientras Dev-Em ordenó a Kara: -Ahora , dame la llave La chica se lanzó contra él mientras golpeaba con sus puños le dijó: -No vas a coger la llave, ni vas a tocar a los humanos... En ese momento, Dev-Em sacó una daga y la clavó en el pecho de la jven que cayó al suelo desplomada y su enemigo masculló -Pobre, Kara.. Vas a morir y ningún familiar te ayudará. Dev-Em estaba a punto de decapitar cuando se escuchó -¡Alto...! Era Paolo y Kara gritó: -¡Paolo,no! -¿Qué quieres, maldito humano?- preguntó Dev-Em con el ceño frucido Paolo le da la llave y Kara chilló: -¡Paolo no lo hagas! -Lo siento,Kara-el brasileño se disculpó -Gracias, humano...,- agradeció DevEm-y tu Kara para que sepas lo haré donde tú vives... -¿Qué hiciste, Paolo?-dijo la joven que cayó desmayada[Chapter 12] Capítulo 12: La Pelea Final * FLASHBACK * El chico llevó al grupo por el camino -¿Dónde nos llevan?- preguntó Thara El niño le llevó a una tribu que estaba haciendo sus haceres pero al ver al grupo de Kara, se asustaron -Creo que se asustan de nosotros.- comentó Knell El niño entró en la choza y segundos después, salió su líder y varios hombres -¿Quién de vosotros habeís matado la criatura?- preguntó el líder La capitana dio un paso adelante y respondió: -Yo he sido, siento si he sido una molestia... Pero entonces, el líder le dio un abrazo a la chica y les agradeció: -Gracias por haber salvado a mi hijo, como obsequio os invito a mi choza -No queremos ser un incordio -No es molestia, es un gran día para nosotros El grupo entraron en la choza y vieron a la gente como drogada: -¿Qué está pasando con estas personas? - espetó Thara -Está en medio de un trance de sueño, según mi tribu ven el fúturo- respondió el jefe -Me gustaría hacerlo- Kara se mostró curiosa -No me gustaría que te hiciera daño-Knell se negó -Tranquilo, Kneel no me pasará nada -¿Estás segura de lo que vas a hacer?- preguntó el jefe -Sí, lo haré -Pues que así sea Segundos después, prepararon para la ceremonia el dejaron un suelo para tumbarse. La capitana se tumbó y uno de los tribus le entregó un mejunje de un recipiente -Con esto, te permitirá ver lo que sea de tu futuro Ella lo bebió, se tumbó y cerró los ojos. Segundos después apareció en una zona de vegetación seca, se levantó y vio una criatura parecía como un cervatillo -Hola, criatura- intentó acercar al ser. Pero éste salió corriendo, la joven se acercó y vio el reflejo de un charco su traje estaba cambiado tenía una chaqueta de cuero roja, camiseta blanca y uno pantalones vaqueros después giró su cabeza y vio una gran ciudad. Después notó que estaba flotando del suelo y empezó a volar pasando por varios lugares -Kara... Kara...Kara - una voz le llamaba * FIN DEL FLASHBACK * -Kara.. Me alegro qué estés bien- exlcamó Mary junto a Ethan y Billy -¿Dónde estoy?- preguntó Kara estaba aun inconsciente -Está en un hospital de los laboratorios de Tess- respondió Billy -Tengo que levantarme...-Kara intentó levantarse de la camilla -No, aún estás débil- Ethan insistió -Lo siento, no pude ayudar -No te preocupes,Kara, lo sabemos- comentó Mary -Ahora descansa- siguó Ethan -No puedo, tengo que impedir que Dev-Em destruya LaTierra En ese momento Paolo interrumpió y preguntó a Kara -¿Podemos hablar? -Chicos, ¿podeís dejarnos unos segundos?- Ella pidió asus amigos que se fueran Ellos se marcharon y la alienígena criticó al brasileño: -No te da vergüenza venir aquí, debería convertirte en ceniza -Sólo vine para pedirte disculpas -¿Disculpas? Si te ví entregar la llave ¿Por qué lo hiciste?¿Por poder, dinero, fama? -Por amor... Yo.. te...quiero Kara se sonrojó y preguntó: -¿Qué? -El día en que me salvaste, tuve un flechazo pero cuando ayudaste con la tribu me enamoraste -No lo sabía -Sé que me odia, así que me daré la vuelta... Kara le pusó la mano sobre el hombro y le dio un beso. Después se preparo y dijo: -Todavía no es tarde para pararlo -¿Y cómo lo vas a conseguir? Casi te mata -Tengo un plan y necesito que me ayudes. En Medville -Es la hora de que todo lo qu me pertenece- masculló Dev-Em que arrojó la la lave en el embalse del pueblo -¡Dev-Em!¡Para de este desastre!- Kara llegó y dió una orden -Llegas tarde, Kara, dentro de unos 5 minutos acabaré con este mundo -No si se puedo evitarlo Ella se lanzó contra Dev-Em dando varios golpes pero él lo esquivaba. -Tonta, recuerda la última vez que pasó- Dev-Em amenaó sacando su arma Él intentó atacar fue rápida yde un golpe le lanzó contra el embalse. -He aprendido de mis errores. Abrio una brecha y rápdiamente se rompió el embalse: -¡Maldición!- espetó la joven La ola del agua se estaba llevando todo por delante. Un padre y su hijo paseaban por el bosque cuando vieron que el agua le iba llevar por delante, el padre protegía a su hijo; pero de repente, l chica se pusó en medio y sus ojos vaporizó todo el agua -¡Maldita, estúpida!¡Has arruinado los planes!¡Otra vez!- gritó Dev-EM Ella ordenó al padre: -Llévatelo , lejos -Eres débil, Kara, te preocupa demasiado con los humanos- recriminó Dev-Em -¡No!Krypton fue destruido pero no quiero destrozar la Tierra- contestó KAra que le envió un gancho derecho llevando a las afueras de los laboratorios de Tricell- -¿Sí así lo quieres? Pues lo tendrás- masculló Dev-Em Él cogió un camión y se lo arrojó contra Kara pero ella lo paró; después la rubia con su supervelocidad creó un tornado dando puñetazos contra el villano, pero él atravesó el muro.Más tarde la chica cogió un trozo de ciga y golpeó al malo varios veces En el edifico los amigos de Kara escucharon ruidos -¿Qué son esos ruidos?-espetó Mary Ethan miró la ventana y se asombró: -Es Kara y está peleando contra alguien En las afueras, Dev-Em cogió una bocanada de aire y sopló todo por delante , la chica salvó rápidamente a la gente y usó su visión calorífica para contra el villano pero él se acercó , cogió la joven por el pescuezo y la ahogaba lentamente. Pero en ese momento;a Dev-Em le olpeó un objeto y eran los amigos de Kara -Suéltalo, bola de cebos con patas- ordenó Ethan al malo -Ethan- Masculló Negro -Eso son tus amigos...-bisbiseó Dev-eM Agarró a Billy y Mary y el villano siguió: -Tu fe en la humanidad te nublas, no ves lo que pasa en este planeta. Nosotros podemos arreglarlo y si no vas conmigo te destruiré junto tus amigos -Tienes razón, ya estoy harta de ser quien soy es hora de seguir lo que debo ser- comentó Kara mientras se puso de pie -¡Kara, ¿pero qué dices?-Ethan se acercó pero la joven le empujo que llegó contra la pared -¡Ethan!- gritaron los dos que fue soltado por Dev-Em que espetó -Kara, al final, por la grandeza de Rao... Nunca creí que final entraras en razón -He abierto los ojos de DEv-Em...Tengo grandes planes pero debemos irnos de aquí -Te seguiré dónde haga falta Ambos Kryptonianos se marcharon del lugar y Ethan preguntó para si mismo: -¿Por qué hace esto Kara? -Lo acogimos como si fuera nuestra familia y nos hace esto-Mary se indignó Paolo ha salido y respondió: -Lo hizo por amor a vosotros -¿Cómo que por amor?¿Acaso no viste lo que pasó con Ethan?- replicó Billy -Si quereis saber la verdad, aquí están las respuestas El brasileño le enseñó un video del Smarthphone -Hola, amigos, sé qué esto es parte de un plan. Siento los problemas que he podido causar pero mi pasado me persigue. Os agradezco con toda mi alma y juro que este planeta no será como en Krypton. En Canadá: Los Kryptonianos estaban sobrevolando y estaban cerca de la Fortaleza y Dev-Em comentó: -Hay muchos humanos aquí, mejor que los destruyamos ahora. -No...Dev-Em- negó Kara- no queremos llamar la atención , conozco una zona para pasar desapercibido Entraron por una entrada secreta y el villano espetó: -¿Qué lugar es este? -Este lugar sería como mi casa ... He estado dormido milllones de años desde que llegué aquí -¿Millones? Espera ... dices que hemos dormido mucho tiempo -Sí... Ven, sígueme KAra le indicaba el camino y Dev-Em sintió curiosidad: -¿Dónde me llevas Kara? -Me gustaría que vieses algo Le llevó a una zona como de control remoto donde había unas llaves: -Con estas llaves convertiremos este planeta en un Nuevo Krypton- explicó la joven -¿Cómo sabrás la llave indicada? Ella cogió una llave , abrió un agujero de un portal e indicó: -Sólo tenes que entrar en el portal -¿Tú no vas a entrar? *FLASHBACK*** Lo que no se vió en la nave de Brasil era que en el video Allura explicó a su hija: -...Habrá enemigos poderosos que tendrás enfrentarte en tu vida, y en caso de que los derroté, necesitarás algún sitio para encerrarlos. Para eso tendrás que ver un puente del mando y en una de las llaves estará o que bscas y yo sé que sabrás cuál es ***FIN DE LA FLASHBACK*** -Kara, ¿no vienes?- repitió Dev-Em Ella dió marcha atrás y replicó: -No vas hacer daño más, Dev-Em, este es tu fin El agujero succionaba al enemigo y éste gritó -Maldita ignorante, me has engañado -Sí, por mis amigos, lo he hecho... -Pues te llevaré conmigo. Dev-Em cogió la capa del Kryptoniana y se la intentó llevar al agujero. Pero Kara recordó lo que dijo su madre: -Recuerda eres una Zor-El -Me llamo Kara y soy una Zor-El. Dio una patada al malo que terminó en ela gujero que luego se convirtió en cristal y finalmente voló sobre el espacio Kara estaba en paz ya terminó su pesadilla, pero luego escuchó los sonidos de comunicaciones -Aqui Argo City, ¿me recibe alguien? KAra cogió una radio de las cápsulas y respondió -Aquí la capitana Kara Zor-El, estoy en el Planeta Tierra¿ Me atiende alguien? -Sí, te atendemos, ¿nos escucha? -Sí, os escucho . Necesito que alguien me recoge,¿ podeís traerme una nave espacial? -Lo lamento..Ahora no podemos, porque... La señal se cortó y pensó dubitativa[Chapter 13] Capítulo 13: Epílogo 2 días después Han pasado varios después de la invasión de Dev-Em en La Tierra, Kara estaba arreglando el embalse y dió un último retoque. -Creo que esto puede aguantar durante un terremoto Después llegó una camioneta y de ella salió sus amigos -Kara, ¿estás aquí?-preguntó Mary en voz -Sí, tened cuidado. Los amigos llegaron donde estaba la Kryponiana y esta dijo: -Me alegro de que sigaís vivos -Veo que has hecho grande cosas- comento Billy -Gracias, Billy, seguramente los obreros hubiese durado 2 años pero yo lo he conseguido en 2 días -Me alegro que este bien- dio Ethan que aún caminaba en muletas -Lo siento, Ethan, pero tenía que hacerlo...- la alienigena se disculpó con su amigo -No te preocupes, KAra, si yo estuviese en tu lugar haría lo mismo.. En una semana me recuperaré -Vamos a casa ¿ vienes con nosotros?- preguntó Mary -Voy.. pero antes tengo que hacer un par de cosas -Vale, pues nos veremos después. La rubia voló y con sus rayos calorifícos dieron algunas nubes porque sabía que si le diese calor a un estado gaseoso pasaría al estado líquido Después se marchó a los laboratorios de Tess, allí estaba la jefa y su novio PAolo: -Veo que has llegado- masculló Tess -¿Teneís lo que pedí?-preguntó Kara -Claro, teníamos esto antes de que llegase -Gracias, Tess, siento lo de pasó en el exterior -No te preocupes, Kara, hiciste bien...Si hubiese transcurrido en pueblo o ciudad sería muy grave -¿Podemos hablar,Kara?- preguntó Paolo -Os dejaré un minutos a solas- dijo Tess que se marchó de la zona -¿Estás segura de que deseas ir?- siguió el brasileño -Sí, Paolo...Debo saber con mi planeta -Me temo que cuando te vaya, no te volveré a ver- dijo Paolo con a cabeza caída La alienígena le dio un beso en los labios y respondió: -Aunque encuentre parte de mi prometo que volveré a verte La rubia se preparó para irse y el chico brasileño dijo: -¡Cuidate! La nave despegó y salió del hángar En casa de Ethan, estaban todos con sus haceres pero un ruido extraño salía de la casa -¿Qué es ese ruido?- espetó Mary El grupo salieron y se encontró con la nave de Kara y ella saludó: -Hola, compañeros...Estoy de vuelta -¿Qué es eso?- preguntó Billy -Una nave espacial -ya, ¿por qué tienes una nave?- preguntó Ethan -Verás, he venido a despedirme..He encontrado señales de mi planeta natal y no quería irme sin decir adiós -¿Te volveremos a ver de nuevo?-preguntó MAry -Nunca diga nunca jamás...Antes de paso, os dejo este regalo, y es cierto lo que dice es una mierda -Kara entregó el videojuego de ET Después despego hacia su destino \"Diario de Bitacora: El día de hoy es que morí como la capitana Kara Zor-El... porque en La Tierra nací como Supergirl\" Los amigos de KAra volvieron a su casa pero en la pantalla de TV, se emitía borrosa la imagen y decía: -¡No estás solo! Segundos después la voz de un hombre se escuchó: -Mi nombre es General Zod...Desde hace tiempo, su mundo ha protegido a uno de nosotros. Pido que devuelva a este individuo a mi custodia. Al Kal-El le digo lo siguiente: ríndete en 24 horas o verás este mundo sufrir las consecuencias ","Summary":" SUPERGIRL: LA ÚLTIMA HIJA DE KRYPTON Capítulo 1: Orígenes Kara Zor-El estaba en Krypton cuando un c"},{"Movie":"Supergirl","Title":"SUPERGIRL THE MOVIE","Author":"jman007","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8095820","Passage":"[Chapter 1] SUPERGIRL THE MOVIE Originally created by Otto Binder for DC comics Screen play by jman007 Cool storyline by jman007 Imaginary Special effects created by jman007 Directed by jman007 Produced by jman007 And the great civilization known as Krypton is no more… during the rise of General Zod several Kryptonians fled their home world when Zod and his followers were defeated these refugees returned home, but the high council would not allow it and so Zar'El younger brother of Jor'El lead these refugees to the planet Argos where they built Argo city And thus Krpton was destroyed and all that remain is Kal'El of earth and refugees of Argo Argo city in many ways resembles Krypton with its snow and ice atmosphere. In the center of the crystal city lay a dome where the high council of Argo city meet. SCENE 1: Zar'El dressed in his white robes stood before the high council holding a blue crystal \"Members of the council as you know our beloved Krypton is no more…\" Some of the members squirmed in their seats when he mentioned Krypton, because there was a deep seated resentment towards their former kinsmen. \"…before its destruction my brother Jor'El sent me a message…\" He raised a blue crystal high then placed it in white terminal. \"I would like to play that message for you now…\" Two rings rose up from a circled symbol on the floor and they began twirling horizontally to each other. A hologram of Jor'El appeared in the rings, \"Zor'El my brother… If my calculations are correct then you will receive this message even though I do not know where you have gone… I am glad you spoke up for the refugees… Perhaps a small part of krypton will survive with you and them… Our calculations were correct… Krypton will destroy itself… The council in its arrogance has refused to listen to me… I have sworn to the council that I and Lara will remain here on Krypton… That word did not include our son Kal'El… I have sent him to a primitive world called earth… I ask you my brother to reach out to him and let him know that he is not alone in the universe…\" The message ended and as the rings returned to the floor Zor'El removed the blue crystal from the panel. One of the council members looked at the others who seemed unwilling to speak, \"How long have you had this message…\" \"I have had it for the past ten years… It is my desire to travel to earth and bring him back here to live among us…\" The council burst into an uproar, \"SILENCE!\" Council Tal'Sar said. Council Hyra'Un spoke up, \"Does your nephew know of his Kryptonian heritage?\" \"He does… The humans know him as Superman… Jor'El chose earth because of the effect their yellow suns have on our molecular structure… Some know him as Clark Kent… The house of Kent raised him… Only his closes allies know him as Kal'El… I have watched him for the past six years… He is an honorable man…\" \"As you say… but living with humans could have corrupted him…\" \"Not so… He is a beacon of light to the humans… An inspiration to them…\" \"I am sorry Zor'El but the answer is no… Your brother stood by silently as the high council denied us access to Krypton…\" \"With good reason… You all would be dead had you remained on Krypton…\" Zor'El's longtime friend and colleague jumped up, \"I cannot sit still no longer… How can any of you dare deny Zor'El this request… If not for him we would still be wondering this galaxy… and it was he who laid the very foundations upon which Argo city now stands… and when this council was formed he refused to lead it or take a seat… We are an ungrateful people…\" In shame the other council members looked at each other and it was Joa'Xi who spoke. \"Your words are true Ner'Ve… Allow us to reconvene later and give you our answer on the morrow…\" \"So say one so say all… Dismissed…\" \"Thank you my friend…\" \"Think nothing of it…\" \"Would you join me for lunch at my home… I know Kara would like to see you…\" \"I will accompany you but I have business elsewhere in the city…\" The two men walk up some steps to a platform the circle on the floor glows white and a crystal ball surrounds them. The ball takes off through the city towards Zor'El's home.[Chapter 2] Scene 2: Argo city resembled Krypton in many ways, with its glass and crystal spires and its advanced technology based on crystal-tech. The planet was protected by a crystal shield and the security force was trained by Zor'El himself. The orb Zor'El and Ner'Ve flew across the city to the blue district. His house unit was three stories a dome shaped edifice that was white with the emblem of El in gold. Kara was in the simulator fighting with a Karo staff against eight Taz warriors. The Taz were a race of aliens the Kryptonians fought during the great war. She blocked left and swept the alien's feet from under him, then she struck the hologram warrior in the chest and it vanished. Kara spun into another and bashed it in the head, as another attacked her behind. She planted her staff into the floor and used it to raise her feet and kick it in the chest. Then she bashed that warrior in the head. There was a chime as the remaining warriors rushed. \"Brainiac freeze program…\" The first warrior was in mid swing and the second was diving at her in the air. The last was in a roll coming towards her, Kara was surrounded on all sides. She left the simulator just as her father entered the foyer of their house. \"Father…\" She beamed wrapping her arms around him. \"Did the council say yes… are you going to earth…\" \"Calm down child you haven't even greeted Ner'Ve…\" \"It is quit alright…\" She bowed, \"Lord Ner… Welcome… you are staying for lunch…\" He kissed her on the forehead, \"Apologies no… I have business else where in the city…\" \"So what did the council say…\" He smiled, \"They said they would think about it…\" They sat down to eat and as they did Kara asked, \"Father if the council says yes may I come with you to earth…\" \"Kara…\" \"I want to see the stars… I want to see earth…\" As Kara spoke she was very passionate. He wiped his mouth, \"I will think about it… Now what were you doing in the simulator…\" \"All life is conflict and we need to be prepared father…\" \"You sound like Laen'Ki… and he is Zodest…\" \"Father that is unfair he just wants us to be prepared as a people… The Dujar are on the war path…\" \"Nothing or no one can get past the shield… Argo is well protected… we have the tech no one need die for nothing…\" \"Father fighting for one's family and friends is not nothing…\" He sighed, \"Enough I have work… go practice your remak…\" Zor'El placed his hand on the wall after he stood up and went into his private lab where a star ship was perched for take off. The Crystal sphere had large spikes poking out and it shimmered. The interior had crystal panels and controls with red cushions. \"Brainiac reconfigure the ship for two…\" \"Reconfiguration will take seven petons…\" \"Begin process…\" While the ship reconfigured Zor'El placed two new crystals inside the ship. A Dujar warship carry the emblem of General Zod approached Argo. The entire crew was made up of Dujar with the exception of the five members of the command crew. They were Kryptonian and the Dujar had agreed to fight for Jaxer who was a pupil of Generl Zod. Jax'Ur was the only man to ever escape the phantom zone without outside help or an accident like n explosion in space. \"Scan the planet…\" Jax'Ur ordered. \"General I am detecting Kryptonian based technology… It is definitely a crystal shield…\" The man speaking was a Kryptonian scientist named Col'Xin. \"We will never penetrate that shield…\" Mala said, she was his right hand and lover. Mala is dressed like Ursa from Superman II. She has a sword strapped across her back and a blaster on each hip, all weapons are of Kryptonian design. \"Mala my dear… As I learned from General Zod… There is always a way… Doctor send the signal…\"[Chapter 3] Scene 3 Argo space control was monitoring all activity in the system, they were tracking a comet passing by the edge of the system. A meteor from Krypton that destroyed a planet in the system and a spacial anomaly. The walls and floor were white and in the center of the room two circles of light spun in opposite directions of each other while the operators sat around it observing the holo-screen in the circles. Laen'Ki entered the control room, \"Report…\" \"Nothing special sir… except for a spacial anomaly that appeared at the edge of our system…\" Laen'Ki: \"Show me…\" Laen'Ki pulls out a x-49 Kryptonian disintegrator and started vaporizing the control room personnel. \"General… this is Laen'Ki come in…\" \"This is General Jax'Ur go ahead…\" \"General the shield will be down in moments… You may begin your attack… Hail General Zod…\" As the planetary shield deactivated Jax'Ur's ship decloaked and they began firing on the city. Hyra'Un \"Zor'El… It is because of you that we are alive and that we have Argo city… as such this council has decided to grant your request…\" Zor'El smiled, \"I thank you for your wisdom in this matter…\" Council Tar'Sal: \"Not so fast Zor'El… We have conditions… There must be no coercion on your part… You must present the facts to Kal'El and he must agrre to accompany you of his own free will… and there must be no further communication with the planet earth… Any Kryptonian tech given to Kal'El by his father must leave earth as well…\" Zor'El sighed in disappointment, \"Very well I shall agree to your terms…\" The Council froze at a whistling sound. \"Incoming…\" The roof was blown in and several members of the council were killed by the falling debris. Ner'Ve: \"Brainiac what hs happened to the shields?\" Brainic computer: \"The Shields have been disabled. Ner'Ve: \"By whom…\" Brainiac: \"Unknown…\" The citizens of Argo ran and screamed in panic as the blasts tore up the city and destroyed buildings. Zor'El and Ner'Ve ran through the streets towards Zor'El's home, \"Kara!\" Kara ran into the room a little frightened, \"Father what is happening?\" He took her by the arm and led her to the wall revealing his secret lab, \"Get in the ship…\" Kara: \"But father I can fight… I want to help…\" Zor'El: \"Don't argue with me!\" She reluctantly boared the ship and he sealed it, then Zor'El grabbed his belt. Plasma bolts rained down on the city for what seemed like an eternity. Dujar Warship: Jax'Ur: \"Mala take two legions down to the planet surface… Kill the council members and bring Zor'El to me alive… and unharmed…\" \"As you command my General… Hail Zod!\" The Dujar warship is 1200 meters long and five hundred wide. The bulky hall is spiked on the forward an aft hall. Two fins protrude from the top and bottom while another two from the sides. Mala' ship touched down and she began issuing orders, \"Find the council members… kill them all! Round up the citizens… You men with me…\" The Argoans fight back, but not for long as the city is over run by Dujar troops. Dujar troops wear spiked armor and their reptilian faces are covered by full helmets. Twenty soldiers stand at attention as Jax'Ur walks down the ramp, they all drop to one knee. \"HAIL JAX'UR!\" They all shout. Mala drops to one knee, \"My lord… I give you Argo city…\" He touches her chin and directing her to rise, \"Mala you are as beautiful as you are deadly…\" \"Laen'Ki wishes to present himself to you milord…\" He was on one knee, \"Hail Zod…\" \"Arise Laen'Ki…\" He obeyed, \"General… I give you Zor'El…\" Two Dujar warriors drag Zor'El forward and made him kneel before Jax'Ur, \"Zor'El at last… It has been a long time…\" \"Not long enough…\" \"Ah yes the phantom zone… Well I escaped it and I have joined the Dujar… or should I say they recruited me to lead them to victory… I gave them so many victories that they gave me my own ship…\" \"To bad they don't know you the way I do… otherwise they would have shot you on sight…\" \"Now Zor'El you will free our brother's and sisters from the phantom zone…\" \"You are out of luck Jax'Ur I don't have anymore xu-crystals…\" \"Then make me some…\" Zor'El grunts and looks at Laen'Ki, \"Tell me Ki what did this dog promise you to turn you…\" He smiled, \"I have always been a loyal follower of Zod…\" \"Make my crystals Zor'El and I swear your passing will be quick…\" \"You are out of luck… because Zod is dead…\" \"He lies!\" Mala yelled slapping Zor'El. \"Do I… by the name of Tor'El founder of the house of El I swear on the Sutaph that Zod, Ursa, and Non are all dead… and may Rou take me if I lie…\" \"If what he say is true then this dog is useless…\" Mala barked, \"Kill him!\" \"No Mala… He can make us weapons and build us a brainiac interface… or an omegahedron…\" \"You may as well kill me because I am not doing any of those things…\" \"He has a daughter… A pretty little thing, just turned seventeen…\" Laen'Ki said. \"A daughter! Bring her to me my men can make a woman of her…\" Zor'El shoved one of the warriors to the ground and attacked Laen, as they struggled he pressed the s like symbol on his belt. \"I will kill you Laen… You traitor…\" Laen rubbed his bleeding lip, then he stood up. \"Hold him!\" He punched Zor'El in the stomach and sent him to his knees. When the Dujar troops entered the house they smashed through the wall to the secret lab, just as the ship was taking off. They barked orders into their wrist COMs but the warship could not shoot it down. \"Where is the ship going Zor'El?\" Jax'Ur demanded. \"You are a smart man… one eye… figure it out…\" Jax'Ur smiled, \"Tell me, where do you Els get this sense of nobility from… I tell you what… I have been saving this crystal for a special occasion and sense you and your retched brother built the phantom zone I will let you see it first hand…\" Jax'Ur pulls out a violet crystal and twists it open up a phantom zone glass he shoves Zor'El into it and it flies off into space. \"Lets see if Zor'El left us any toys to play with… Laen… begin the mining process…\" The Argonians were enslaved and forced into manual labor…[Chapter 4] Scene 4 As this narration is going on the music from Superman I is playing the music when baby Kal'El is traveling through space to earth Kara was in the crystal starship and was put to sleep as the ship speed through space. A voice spoke to her as she slept, \"This ship is programmed to travel to the planet earth… Earth is a primitive planet inhabited by beings who live in different countries… A diverse planet in culture beliefs and government… The more powerful countries of the planet have trade agreements in trade and other matters… These people have a lot of potential but lack direction as a whole… Kal'El the only son of Jor'El and Lara was raised by two humans named Jonathan and Martha Kent… on a small farm in an area of the Americas known as Smallville… They adopted him and named him Clark Kent… This dual identity serves Kal'El well as he interact with the human species… There are few who know his real name trusted friends… Because of the yellow sun Kal'El's dense molecular structure have gifted him with the ability to defy gravity… He is invulnerable to harm and his physical strength and speed are boundless… He can see in every known range of vision known to science and his eyes can produce extreme heat… A heat vision if you will… Any Kryptonian traveling to a planet with a yellow sun will absorb the radiation emitted by that sun… Which is one of the chief reasons my brother sent him to the planet…\" As the ship traveled the auto-voice expounded on many aspects of quantum science, stellar math, galactic politics, and the social aspects of earth. The ship finally arrived and streaked across the sky as it entered the atmosphere and tore up the ground near the Kent farm. \"Jonathan…\" Martha Kent shook her husband in the bed next to him. \"Jonathan get up…\" It was one thirty in the morning, \"What is it…\" He asked sitting up yawning. \"Something hit in the yard… it shook the house…\" The dog was barking. Jonathan put on his robe and went downstairs, the dog was on the porch barking at something. A crystal looking object lay smoking in a ditch it had made, Jonathan Kent carefully climbed down into the trench. He gasped when he saw the S looking symbol of the top of the diamond shaped ship. \"Martha! You better come take a look at this…\" She joined him twenty minutes later, \"Jonathan do you think…\" \"I don't know Martha… Clark said that Jor'El told him he was the only one except for those people in the phantom zone…\" They opened it and inside was teenage girl wearing white clothes with a black and white S symbol on the front. \"Help me get inside then I'll drag this thing in the shed and use the tractor to cover up this mess…\" Kara was dreaming of her people nd her father, she heard her father's voice and sat up screaming and breathing heavy. She looked at the primitive surroundings she was in and finally noticed an elderly looking man and woman sitting next to the bed she was on. She pulled her sheets up to her neck and addressed them in Kryptonian. \"Ke'Xata… Lin Rama..Nu deya hi un Zar'El mevola Te'Kara…\" Jonathan and Martha looked at each other, \"I'm sorry but do you speak English?\" Kara cleared her throat, \"Me… no… Am I sorry…\" She sighed and closed her eyes, \"I… am… sorry… Is this… earth…\" \"Yes…\" They answered at the same time. \"I learn to speak language while coming here… Me name…\" she sighed again, \"My name is Kara…\" \"Well I am Jonathan…\" She beamed, \"Jonathan and Martha Kent…\" The Kitchen: \"You see there were refugees who fled Krypton and my father lead them to Argo… where he built Argo city… My mother died giving birth to me… Our planet was attacked… my father had me hide in ship… He must have launched it by remote… That is how I came to be here… I need Kal'El's help…\" Martha was getting coffee, \"That might be a problem… Here…\" Jonathan handed Kara a newspaper. The headline read Superman travels to distant star system to negotiate a treaty on behalf of earth. \"He's gone?' Kara asked. \"He left four days ago… Um as an excuse for Clark he told everyone he would be on assignment in Afghanistan…\" \"Is there is someone he trusted that I can speak with…\" Martha sits down, \"What about that Professor Hamel at Star Labs…\" She asked. \"Professor Hamel…\" They call him, \"My name is Kara and this is going to sound weird but Superman… is my cousin…\" He hung up on her. \"He hung up…\" \"I don't blame him…\" \"You are going to have to go to Metropolis and see him face to face…\" Martha said. \"Yeah and since you are related to Clark and come from the same place can't you fly and do all those things…\" Jonathan said speaking up. Kara focuses on her cup, her eyes glow and she heats the coffee. Then she goes outside and leaps into the air, she flips around laughing not being used to flying and smashes through the roof of the barn. Martha and Jonathan run into the barn and she smiles, \"I'll fix that…\" \"You are going to have to practice…\" Jonathan said[Chapter 5] Scene 5 Metropolis Three weeks later: \"That will be thirty dollars ma'am…\" The cab driver takes forty and gives the teenage girl back her change. A shy looking brunette goes to the desk and asks for Clark Kent's apartment, the security guard lets her go up. She is about to enter the apartment when Jimmy Olsen comes up to her. \"Laura… Laura Lee… I'm Jimmy Olsen… I talked with you on the phone…\" \"Oh yes… Its nice to meet you...\" They shook hands. \"Sorry I didn't meet at the airport… Traffic in this city is ridiculous… Here let me get that for you…\" They enter the apartment and Jimmy shows Laura around. \"I can't believe Mister Kent forgot that you were coming in town…\" \"Well yeah that is cousin… I spoke with him and he said I could stay here until he get's back…\" \"Sure… well look I spoke with Mr. Perry and he said he has a job for you in the mail room if you want it…\" \"Thank you… Um can you tell me where Star Labs is…\" \"Yeah its on star drive a block off Superman lane…\" \"Superman Lane?\" Daily Planet: \"The outgoing mail goes here… the incoming mail here… When the mail is sorted you will take it to each floor… everything but this it goes strait to correspondence room… Any questions… good…\" A burly man with a balding head said. \"And look I don't care who your cousin is you screw up and you are out of here…\" \"What a delightful man…\" At lunch Laura called professor Hamel, but again he hung up on her. Then she called Jonathan and Martha Kent to let them that she was fine. \"Yeah I know… I am going to have to go up there and show him who I am…\" Star Labs: \"Professor are you alright…\" His assistant asked \"Yes… some woman keeps calling claiming she is related to Superman…\" They laughed, \"That is a first…\" Daily Planet: Jimmy comes down to the mail room, its closing time and people are getting off. \"Hey Laura me and some friends are going out to paint the town… You want to come…\" \"Perhaps a rain check… I have other plans…\" \"Alright catch you later…\" Laura went home and decided to see Hamel in person. She flew off the balcony across the high above the skyscrapers so that she wouldn't be seen. Hamel was just leaving the Star Labs and drove home. He lived in a penthouse apartment downtown and switched on the lights he got a drink from the fridge and as he returned to the living room he notices a woman dressed as superman with a skirt floating by the window. She waves at him and he drops his drink. \"You're the one from the phone… you weren't kidding…\" \"My name is Kara and yes he is my cousin…\" \"You're a supergirl…\" She blushed, \"I was sent here by accident… My people were attacked and my father had me hide in a ship he was going to use to come to earth and ask Kal'El if he would join us on Argo… but now… I need his help to save my people from the invaders… Is there anyway to contact him…\" \"Superman gave me a way to contact him in case of an emergency… Um his ship is still in hyperspace it will take another forty-eight hours then I will be able to contact him…\" \"Well in two days I shall return…\" Kara stood up to leave and flew out of the window. Hamel just stood there watching in disbelief as she flew off. As Kara flew through the night sky a cry pierced her enhanced hearing and she descends on the park, where a man was forcing himself on a woman in a car. She pauses as a woman dressed as Superman lands in by the car and rips the door off. She grabs the man and lifts him in the air like he is paper doll, \"Holy Shit!\" \"The lady said no!\" She throws the man to the side and attempts to help the woman in the car. \"Look out!\" She screams. The man hits her with a large branch from a tree that shatters on impact against her back. Kara kicks the man in between his legs and carries both of them off. \"Excuse me officer…\" She lands carry two people, the man is in the fetal position. \"This man tried to force himself on this young lady…\" Then she takes off into the officer looking in disbelief. As Kara is flying she hears sirens off cop cars chasing a runaway bus, \"We are live from channel nine news chopper and as you know the Metropolis Metro just fired a bunch of people… Well one of those workers stole a bus and is driving at high speeds with several passengers in the bus…\" A blue flash whizzes by the chopper. \"What the hell was that?\" The pilot asked. \"My God a woman dressed like Superman just landed in the path of the bus… Incredible this Supergirl is holding her hands out and my God she stopped the bus and she is turning the bus over… People if you watching this live there is actually a Supergirl in Metropolis… She shattered the glass and she is pulling the driver from the bus and now she has tied him up in a chain link fence…\" Kara flies up to the bus and waves at the camera and then she flies off. A building is burning and Kara x-rays the building there are two people still trapped inside she flies into the building and flies out with two people. She leaps back into the air and flies round the building creating a vortex putting out the flames.[Chapter 6] Scene 6 Argo City: The Argonians were put to work as slaves mining Argo while Jax'Ur enjoyed his power over his Kinsmen. He sat on a throne with Mala at his side while the nobles of Argo presented hi with their prized possessions. Col'Xin burst into the throne room with a crystal, \"Milord you need to see this…\" He placed the crystal in the control panel after all the Argonians were made to leave the throne room. A hologram of Jor'El appeared in the center of the twirling rings. \"Zor'El my brother… If my calculations are correct then you will receive this message even though I do not know where you have gone… I am glad you spoke up for the refugees… Perhaps a small part of krypton will survive with you and them… Our calculations were correct… Krypton will destroy itself… The council in its arrogance has refused to listen to me… I have sworn to the council that I and Lara will remain here on Krypton… That word did not include our son Kal'El… I have sent him to a primitive world called earth… I ask you my brother to reach out to him and let him know that he is not alone in the universe… Farewell my brother and may Rou watch over you all…\" \"Where is the earth?\" Jax'Ur asked. Col'Xin placed another crystal in the panel and a map of the known universe was displayed. \"There is the milky way galaxy… Third planet from the yellow star… Terron sector… These people have a primitive space technology… They can send robot probes to a planet they call mars… They will be easy to conquer…\" \"I am not interested in conquering this back water planet… I want the children of El… Laen!\" A few minutes later Laen'Ki came to the throne room. \"Its time for you to prove yourself again… The daughter of Zor'El has gone to a primitive planet called earth… Also on this planet is Jor'El's heir Kal'El bring them both to me alive and unharmed…\" He saluted, \"I will not fail you milord… Hail Zod….\" \"No Laen… Hail Jax'Ur…\" \"Hail Jax'Ur…\"[Chapter 7] Scene 7 Earth/The Daily Planet: Laura/Kara is walking towards the Daily planet and she stops to watch the news report. \"And the whole world is a buzz about Supergirl and her latest save as she brings a sinking ship to shore saving everyone on board…\" She smiles and heads into the Daily Planet building and strait to the mail room. Jimmy Olsen: \"Hey Laura did you hear about Supergirl…\" Laura/Kara: \"I sure did…\" Mail Room boss: \"Hey Olsen get out of here and let my star worker work…\" Jimmy: \"Alright I'm going… Hey Laura are we on for the night…\" Olsen: \"We sure are…\" Lex Corp: Lex Luthor \"Unbelievable…\" Mercy: \"You know what they say Lex while the cats away… but the cat left another to keep the mice in line… Are we canceling the project…\" Lex tapped a pen on the desk, \"I don't think so… This Supergirl showed up four days after Superman left… She the real deal… and she wears the same emblem… She may come from a system similar to Krypton and she probably has the same powers… During Zod's short rule of the earth he always hinted at other Kryptonians who survived the destruction of the planet…\" Mercy was sitting on the edge of the desk: \"So what… She is a phantom zoner…\" Lex: \"No… Zod tried to overthrow his people… civil war can be a scary thing… So what if a group Kryptonians left the planet during the war…\" Mercy: \"And the big S… she wears…\" Lex: \"Each family f Krypton has its own family crest… She wears the S because she is related to our big blue alien friend… The one thing that escapes me is… Why she is here…\" Mercy: \"Accident…\" Lex: \"Noooo… She wants something from Superman… anyway we will continue as planned, but I want something extra done I want to see if she is as strong as Superman…\" Night Club: Laura is walking up the street Jimmy: \"Thanks for coming this is Chloe Sullivan my fiancée… and this is Ethan Bale…\" Ethan: \"Wow I mean wow…\" Laura smiles and they shake hands/Jimmy: \"So lets go in…\" Ethan: \"You want to dance…\" Kara/Laura: \"Sure…\" They dance while Chloe and Jimmy remain at the table. Chloe: \"They make a great couple… What does he do anyway…\" Jimmy: \"He is just as secretive as Laura that is why I put them together…\" Chloe: \"Jimmy Olsen… match maker…\" Ethan's phone rings: \"Excuse me I have to take this…\" Laura uses her super hearing to listen in, \"What now… Well when do I meet this boss… Okay fine… Its no problem and neither will the cops be a problem…\" Ethan returns to Laura and takes her to the table, \"Hey guys I am sorry, work I got to go… Um Laura I'll catch up with you later…\" Three hours later eight men are dressed in ski masks, dark clothing and heavily armed. They burst into national art museum and grab tons of stuff, but Supergirl shows up. They start shooting but the bullets shatter and ricochet off her, Supergirl: \"Your kidding right…\" In a flash she disarms the men and they try to escape in an armored vehicle, but Supergirl grabs the truck as it tries to pull off. She flips the truck over and punches a hole in the metal side. Then she rips open the side and stumbles back as one of the men hold out a green glowing rock. As she stumbles backwards she grabs the man mask off and gasps, it is Ethan. Supergirl: \"Ethan… What are you doing?\" She starts breathing heavy and feeling weak. Thug: \"Come on lets go the cops…\" Ethan drops the rock by Supergirl so they can get away. The cops help her by removing the rock and she thanks them and flies off. Daily Planet: Laura slams her purse on Jimmy's desk. Jimmy: \"Laura I thought you were off today… So tell me you had a good time last night…\" Laura/Kara: \"Wonderful… What do know about him…\" Jimmy: \"About as much as I know about you… I though the two of you would hit it off… He is good guy… Why did something happen?\" Laura/Kara: \"No I just wanted to know more about him… I have somewhere to be catch you later…\"[Chapter 8] Scene 8 Supergirl flies to Star Labs to meet with Professor Hamel: Hamel: \"A lot of people are asking about you…\" Supergirl: \"I know… I will make a statement to the press today…\" Hamel takes a crystal from the wall vault and places it in a small white octagon looking device. A few minutes later Superman's image appears, \"Professor…\" Hamel: \"Superman… Meet Supergirl…\" Supergirl addresses him in Krypton: \"Greetings Kal'El… Can you understand me…\" He nods yes, \"My name is Kara… Zor'El is my father the younger brother of your father Jor'El… After the civil war with Zod… My father lead a few refugees to the planet Argo and built Argo city… Recently our planet came under attack by Jax'Ur a Zodest… and we were betrayed by Laen'Ki… During the attack my father had me hide in a ship he was planning to use to come to earth and ask you to live with us on Argo… He must have used a remote with me and sent me here for my safety… I have powers like you, but I need your help to return to Argo and free my people… I know your father gave you a lot of crystal tech… We can build weapons and ships to free my people…\" Superman: \"Kara I believe you, but I just arrived and the people of New Genesis will take great offence if I just leave… I will hurry these negotiations as fast as possible… In the meantime I have a fortress in the northpole… You can go there if you need too…\" Supergirl: \"Thank you for the offer, but your earth parents helped me to get in your apartment as Laura Lee the cousin of Clark Kent… I work in the mail room at the Daily Planet…\" Superman: \"Good I will be back as soon as possible… Start making the weapons and ships for our journey… Farewell Kara of Argo…\" The image vanished, Hamel: \"Well you could teach me to speak Kryptonian…\" Press Conference: Hamel: \"Ladies and gentlemen…May I present Supergirl…\" She walks to the podium and clears her throat, \"Good morning everyone… You must have many questions for and I can answer them all with one phrase… Yes I am Supergirl and Superman is my cousin…\" Lex Corp: Lex Luthor is watching the news: \"Ha… What did I tell you Mercy…\" Mercy: \"Hells a freeze Lex… I got some good news and some bad news… Supergirl showed up and our friends say the rock worked… She has the same weakness as big blue…\" Lex Luthor: \"So what is the bad news…\" Mercy: \"Ethan Bale… He is an uncover cop FBI agent…\" Lex Luthor: \"Do they have anything on me?\" Mercy: \"No… but this Ethan is too close…\" Lex Luthor: \"Terminate our association with everyone…\" Kara/Laura's apartment: Ethan knocks at the door, Laura opens it and sees Ethan, \"Its me why haven't you returned any of my calls…\" She shuts the door. \"Come on Laura at least tell me what I did…\" Laura/Kara: \"Go away…\" Ethan: \"I am staying right here until tell me what I did…\" Thugs: \"No you're not cause you and your girlfriend are coming with us!\" The Thug shoots Ethan with a stun dart. While they drag him away another group bursts into the apartment. Supergirl: \"Who are and why are you here…\" Thug: \"Oh shit its her… where did she come from…\" Thug 2: \"Who cares blast her…\" He fires a grenade launcher at Supergirl, the explosion leaves burn marks on the floor, walls, and furniture. Supergirl ties the thugs up and flies over the city following the van. Hide Out: Thug: \"Wakey… wakey… Mr. FBI…\" Ethan: \"What are you talking about…\" He asks in a groggy tone. Thug: \"Yeah we know all about you and now you die…\" Ethan: \"Maybe another time…\" He jumps up while tied to the chair and smashes it on the floor. With the leg of the chair still tied to his calf he spin kicks the first thug, head butts the second guy, and tackles the last. When he stands up thug 4 is pointing a machine gun at him. The thug fires, but Supergirl lands in front of Ethan blocking the gunfire. She fires heat beams from her eyes and melt the gun, as the cops arrive she flies off with Ethan. Ethan: \"Okay I'm not found of heights put me down…\" They land on the roof of a building/Supergirl: \"Big baby…\" Ethan: \"Thanks you saved my life…\" Supergirl: \"Why didn't you tell me you were an FBI agent…\" Ethan: \"Um we just met…\" Supergirl smiles: \"Close your eyes…\" Ethan: \"Why?\" Supergirl: \"Trust me just do it…\" He does and as his eyes are closed she turns into Laura, \"Okay open them…\" Ethan gasps: \"Laura? Are you…\" He motions with his hands. Laura: \"Yes, but you can't tell anyone…\" Ethan: \"Well I like Laura better… She is hotter, but can I kiss you in the Supergirl outfit…\" She smiles: \"I should be mad at you, but that was beautiful and since I am the same person…\" She pulls her blouse open and the skirt turns red and her brown hair turns blonde…\" They Kiss…[Chapter 9] Scene 9 Pentagon: Station Worker: \"Copy that… Sir NSA is picking up an unidentified object pulling into a stationary orbit of our planet… The Russians are tracking it as well…\" The General picks up the phone: \"Get me the President… I don't care what he is doing get him on the line now!\" Earth Orbit Alien Warship: Laen'Ki: \"Full stop…\" Dujar Operator: \"Sir we can't get a complete scan of the surface… To much interference from all thise satellites…\" Laen'Ki: \"Never mind that scan all frequencies of the planet and disrupt the signals… Then broadcast…\" Every station on earth was interrupted by the alien signal/Laen'Ki \"People of earth My name is Laen'Ki…\" Laura/Kara was watching the TV at work. \"I serve High General Jax'Ur your planet is too primitive to conquer… Kara… Kal'El… I know the two of you can hear me surrender… give yourselves up or I will use this ship superior weapons and turn the cities of this planet to ash… You have one hour…\" People all the earth started to panic and scream, governments all over tried to issue emergency alerts, but the aliens controlled all broadcasting signals. Kara went to the Janitor closet and flew up and out of the venting system as Supergirl. She landed on the roof of the Daily planet and spoke into a wrist band. Supergirl: \"Laen… I am here you need not harm these people… I surrender…\" Her voice could be heard all over the earth. Ethan drove in his car like a madman trying to get to the Daily planet. When he was three blocks away he started running. Dujar Warship: Pilot: \"Commander we have her…\" Laen'Ki : \"Show me…\" The screen zoomed in on Kara standing on the roof of the Daily Planet. \"Bring her to me unharmed…\" Daily Planet: Ethan had just made it to the roof: \"Supergirl!\" Supergirl: \"Ethan… What are you doing here?\" Ethan: \"Don't do it…\" Supergirl: \"I must… If I don't then they will kill innocent people…\" Ethan: \"I love you!\" Supergirl smiled: \"You love me…\" He nodded, \"I love you too…\" A shuttle was landing on the roof as they kissed and Dujar warriors got out. \"Do not worry I have a plan…\" Dujar warrior: \"Stand back human…\" They shackle Kara and lead her back to the shuttle and it takes off. Laen'Ki: \"I have one Argonian… Now where is the Krytonian…\" The doors swoosh open and they bring Kara before Laen'Ki. \"Ah Kara…\" She uses her x-ray vision on him and can tell that Laen has absorbed yellow sun but he is unaware of his power. \"…It nice to see you again…\" Kara: \"Where is my father?\" Laen'Ki: \"The phantom zone where you soon will be… unless you agree to become my consort…\" Kara: \"I would rather marry a Tuvolian Murgbat…\" Laen'Ki smiled, \"Who was that human you were kissing I don't think your father would approve perhaps I should kill him and everyone in the city…\" Supergirl: \"I have a better idea…\" She snaps the cuffs they bound her with and kicks Laen in between his legs, then she punches him with all her might. A shockwave shatters all the glass on the bridge and Laen goes flying across the bridge and through eight walls. The Dujar bridge crew start shooting plasma bolts at her, but they have no affect. She throws one of them into the view screen and another she slams into the wall and flies through the ship making a hole. She flies into space and grabs the ship and throws into deep space away from earth. Kara watches the ship until it is too far away to return without first making repairs. Warship: Laen'Ki staggers to get up as the kick to the groin was painful and the punch afterward was even more shocking. He looked in disbelief at the holes he made and even more shocking was the destruction on the bridge. He shocked himself by grabbing the fragmented metal and bending it back in place. The crew just stared at him in disbelief as well. Then he flew up and sealed the hole in the ceiling. Laen'Ki: \"What is happening to me… Damage report…\" Bridge Officer: \"Sir the main view screen is damaged and the lateral controls not functioning… We have main power… All weapons are offline… Um she grabbed the ship by the main thrusters it will take several hour to repair…\" Laen'Ki: \"Get started… What about communications?\" Bridge Officer: \"Damaged beyond repair sir…\" Earth: Kara watched them and listened as she floated above earth, \"They will be back… I need a plan… Kal'El where are you?\" Kara flew back through earth's atmosphere and headed to the north pole after the Dujar warship left, she flew to the fortress of Solitude. Two ice shards in front of the fortress reshaped and became Ice drones. \"Identify yourself or be terminated…\" The ice drones demanded. \"I am Kara daughter of Zor'El and Alura of the house of El…\" The Ice drones scanned her body and then they scanned the emblem on her chest. \"You may enter daughter of El…\" The drones replied then they returned to two ice shards. Kara floated through the fortress and finally came before the white control panel and an array of crystals. She chose a clear crystal and placed it in the panel. \"Kal'El my son…\" It was a hologram of Kara's aunt Lara, she smiled and removed the crystal. Then she chose another, \"Kryptonian memory bank 77-0B… The anti-life equation…\" The image vanished when she removed the crystal. This time Kara picked up a green crystal. Brainiac: \"I am brainiac artificial module 1-009… I contain all known technology of Krypton and information spanning nine of the major Galaxies including New Genesis and Apokolypse… What do you wish to know Kara…\" Kara: \"You know who I am?\" Brainiac: \"I am brainiac I know all that goes on around me…\" Kara: \"Earth is danger and I cannot fight five Kryptonians alone and the entire Dujor war fleet… Can I build a planetary shield using earth and Kryptonian technology…\" Brainiac: \"One moment please… You will need the following things to create an absorbtion shield array… You will need four large dish satellites… and another four space satellites… You will need eight Ero-5 crystals to radiate the dishes with… each dish must draw power from a nuclear rod… The dishes must be placed at even four quadrants across the planet… The space satellites must be placed in orbit at parallel coordinates to relay the signal… Then you will have your planetary shield array…\" Kara: \"Thank you Brainiac…\" She removed the brainiac crystal from the panel and left the fortress of solitude.[Chapter 10] Scene 10 The White House: Secretary of Defense: \"Mr. President If the aliens return I recommend a full nuclear strike…\" Four Star General: \"These aliens have superior weaponry… Firing nukes may only provoke them…\" The secretary walks in: \"Mr. President… Supergirl is here…\" The President: \"Show her in…\" Supergirl walks in they shake hands The President: \"Supergirl… can you help us if those aliens return…\" Supergirl: \"First Mr. President… They were after me… and yes I can help you… My plan is to combine Kryptonian technology with your technology… There are some things I need from you…\" President: \"Tell us…\" Supergirl: \"I need four large ground dishes… and another four space based dishes…. And I will handle the rest…\" The Secretary of defense: \"Supergirl we need you to make a statement to the press and calm the people…\" White House Press Conference Room: Superirl: \"Ladies and gentlemen… The aliens that threatened your planet were after me… I stopped them for the time being but they will be back… I have with spoken with the President and using our combined resources we will create a planetary shield to protect earth from this threat…\" Lois Lane: \"Supergirl… Lois Lane for the Daily Planet… has their been any word from Superman…\" Supergirl: \"Yes I spoke with him and as soon as his negotiations are complete he will return to earth…\" Reporter: \"Supergirl… Supergirl… Alex Riley from the chronicle… This shield will affect our atmosphere…\" Supergirl: \"No it is safe… Now if you will excuse me I have work to do…\" Mount Rushmore: Supergirl is flying towards Mount Rushmore carrying large dish by the base to the mountain. She sets the dish down and then sets a nuclear rod to a Kryptonian device to power it. Then she lined the dish with a crytal, when placed the crystal on the dish it spread across the surface of the dish and then she activates it. An invisible shield spread across the entire planet engulfing the moon as well.[Chapter 11] Scene 11 Argo: Laen'Ki and his men shamefully walk into the throne room. Jax'Ur: \"Where are the children of El…\" Laen'Ki drops to one knee, \"My Lord forgive me… I have failed you… Kara… she threw my warriors around like they were nothing and… and I flew… and I had the strength of a thousand men…\" Jax'Ur: \"What non-sense is this…\" Col'Xin: \"I can explain…\" He said scanning Laen'Ki's body, \"This planet has a yellow sun… Our dense molecular structure can absorb the radiation of yellow stars… They give us immense physical power… Molecular enhancement… Of course that is why Jor'El chose the planet for his son…\" Jax'Ur: \"These powers would we have them as well…\" Col'Xin: \"Any Kryptonian exposed to a yellow star would have this power… We would all the five of us have this power…\" Mala stepped forward: \"Five against two are better odds…\" Col'Xin: \"Perhaps we should do some recon on the planet and see what we are dealing with… I can send a star probe… maybe we can even find an ally among the humans… Someone who will help gain advantage over this Superman…\" Jax'Ur: 'Very well Professor Xin I leave it to you… Mala kill the Argonians we can't risk them going to earth…\" Earth: The star probe scanned the planet and found a planetary shield based on Kryptonian technology. Then it scanned the planet and secretly hacked earth's systems. Lex Corp: Lex Luthor stood on the balcony of his office watching the planetary shield via his advanced optic scanner. \"Isn't a thing of beauty Mercy…\" Mercy: \"It is…\" Lex Luthor: \"Can my science teams get close to the shield generators…\" Mercy: \"They are being guarded by US soldiers… all over the world…\" A holographic image appeared behind them. \"Uh Lex…\" Probe: \"Lex Luthor… Greetings I am an advanced probe sent by the High General Jax'Ur… General Jax'Ur is a former student of General Zod… If you help us take over this planet and defeat the one known as Supergirl we shall give you powerful position in the new order…\" Lex Luthor: \"I have always had an affinity for beach front property… Make me the ruler of Australia…\" Restaurant: (To all my readers I should have been calling Laura/Linda… So from this point on she will be referred to as Linda) Linda: \"This is nice what is the occasion…\" Ethan: \"The occasion is you… Linda… I have never met someone like you before…\" Linda: \"You mean a girl who can lift a tractor trailer with one arm…\" Ethan: \"No someone who is smart and intelligent… Someone who is fun to be around… Forget the fact that you can fly and that you are related to Superman means nothing…\" Linda blushes: \"Yeah right…\" Ethan: \"I want to know everything about you… How old are you… what was your planet like… What is your mother and father like… Will Superman break me half if he doesn't like me… What is your real name…\" They laugh and Linda sighs, \"Well Kryptonian women aren't as vain as earth females… In earth time I am seventeen… In Argo time I am one hundred and seventy years old…\" Ethan gasps, \"Well I like older women…\" Linda smiles: \"Argo is a lot like Krypton… A frozen ice surface… glass and crystal spires… I wish you could see the frozen oceans of Argo… My mother died giving birth to me…\" Ethan: \"I'm sorry… If you look anything like her she was very beautiful…\" Linda: \"Thank you… My father is strong and noble man… He'd like you… As for Kal'El he reminds me of all the men in our family… He'd liked you…\" Just then Linda places her hands over her ears because of a whistling sound, \"Hello… Mike check… This is Lex Luthor… Only one person with less than four legs can here this and that's you Supergirl… I thought it was time we met… Your cousin and I are old friends… You probably will try to ignore me… That is why I placed ten pounds of chemical compound on a ship and I will detonate it if you don't come to my office in the next ten minutes… See you soon blondey…\" Ethan: \"Are you alright?\" Linda: \"Something has come up… I have to go…\" Ethan: \"I can help you…\" Linda: \"Tell the authorities that Lex Luthor has placed a chemical bomb in the city…\" She dashes to women's bathroom and flies out the window as Supergirl. Ethan: \"Lex Luthor… Chemical bomb… Its trap…\" Ethan rushes to his car and speeds up the street. Lex Corp: Mercy: \"Here she comes…\" Supergirl is flying by the window and lands on the balcony, she kicks the door down and enters. Supergirl: \"Lex Luthor…\" Lex Luthor: \"Supregirl… Its nice to finally meet you… This is my personal assistant Mercy Graves…\" Supergirl: \"Where is the bomb?\" Lex Luthor: \"There is no bomb… Your just like cousin all muscle and no brain… You're a blonde so you got two things against you…\" Supergirl: \"Making me angry is something you really want to do…\" Lex Luthor: \"Actually this is a distraction while my mercenary friends disables one the shield generators… Mercy!\" Mercy pulls out a green rock and Supergirl falls to the floor weakened, \"Its called Krytonite… You see you have the same weakness as your cousin… Oh I am not going to kill you… just keep you on ice while your friends take over the world… Don't feel bad your cousin fell for the same trick…\" Shield Generator: \"We need back up!\" A soldier screamed, but a mercenary fires a rocket at the dish blowing it up. Jax'Ur's personal fleet is approaching earth and as the fighters fly across the planet destroying military outposts. Within hours the planet is under the control of Jax'Ur's warriors. Lex Corp: Ethan bursts into the office with his gun drawn, \"Let her go and you Lex Luthor are under arrest…\" Mercy drops the Kryptonite by Supergirl and raises her hands. Lex Luthor: \"You must be Ethan the FBI agent…\" Ethan: \"Put the rock back in the box…\" Mercy rolls to the floor and kicks the gun from his hand, then she kicks Ethan in between his legs and clips him with her feet. She rolls again and grabs the gun just as the Dujar arrive. Lex Luthor: \"Don't kill him I want him alive…\" he says as the Dujar warriors take him prisoner. Supergirl: \"Ethan…\" She cries in her weakened condition. The commander places an orb on the floor and it projects an image of Jax'Ur, \"You have done well Lex Luthor ruler of Australia… Commander…\" The Dujar commander takes out a phantom zone crystal and casts Supergirl into the glass prison. As it floats off into space Ethan screams for Supergirl. The commander then places the green rock in the led box and the five Kryptonians come to Lex Corp. They all fly out of the window and head towards the White House. Mercy: \"You didn't tell them about the fortress of solitude Lex…\" Lex Luthor: \"Of course not… I intend to travel to the north pole and take all of Superman's secrets… Then I will send them to the phantom zone as well…\"[Chapter 12] Scene 12 White House: When Jax'Ur arrived at the White House the secret service let him pass at the President's orders. Jax'Ur: \"Mr. President… It is an honor…\" The President: \"How did you get pass the shield?\" Jax'Ur: \"I think you already know the answer to that question…\" The President: \"You will fail… When Superman returns…\" Jax'Ur: \"Ah yes your Superman… The five of us possess the same power as he does… We have already taken care of Supergirl… You think he can stand before five… Now kneel before Jax'Ur…\" The Phantom Zone a prison of the mind and body, the body is held in a glass- crystal prison while the mind is sent to an artificial astro-plain. Kara awakens in the phantom body her transparent body felt real, but it was not. She tried to fly and fell to the ground. She tried to crush a rock in her hand, but she couldn't. \"Hello…\" Phantom Zoner: \"Hey little pretty…\" Phantom Zoner 2: \"Look at that symbol… She is a daughter of El… Kill her!\" Phantom Zoner 1: \"No lets have a little fun first…\" Supergirl: \"No…\" She screams as they force her to ground. Phanton Zoner 1: \"Just relax baby…\" Phantom Zoner 1 is grabbed from behind by a robed man and stabbed in the back. Then the rescuer grabs the second man and slits his throat. The robed man bends down to Kara's side. \"You are safe now child… Come with me…\" Kara: \"Father?\" Zor'El places his finger over his cowled mouth, \"Shhhh!\" Hut at the base of the mountain: Kara: \"Father earth is danger I have failed…\" Jor'El: \"You haven't failed child… I failed… I should have recognized Laen\"Ki for the traitor he is…\" Kara stood up, \"When Kal'El returns to earth he will walk into a trap…\" Zor'El looks at her confused, \"Returns?\" Kara: \"When I got to earth I missed him by four days… He left for New Genesis to negotiate a treaty with them…\" Jor'El smiled, \"The people of New Genesis are powerful they will make great allies for earth…\" Kara: \"Not if Jax'Ur wins… Father I have to try and get back…\" Zor'El smirked, \"There is no back this is the phantom zone…\" Kara: \"If Jax'Ur can escape then so can we… I mean you and uncle built this place… There must be a way…\" Zor'El: \"That won't matter for me… My body is in space traveling through Argo's system… Even if I got back to my body I would die in space… unlike you… The yellow sun will sustain you…\" Kara: \"Well show me how to get out and I will free you after I defeat Jax'Ur…\" Zor'El stood up and gave her something poncho like to wear with a hood. \"The house of El is responsible for most of the people and creatures imprisoned here… So walking around dressed like that is not a good idea… Come with me…\" They treck across the vast wasteland towards the mountains where the sky and gound merged into one, the edge of Phantom Zone. A few people sat staring in the distance ignoring them. Others watched them brave the rocky path to edge of eternity as it was called. Kara slipped and tore her poncho revealing the S like symbol beneath. \"El!\" Someone screamed. Zor'El: \"Run I shall hold them off!\" Kara: \"But father!\" Zor'El: \"Run don't argue… You are the one who must make it or earth is doomed…\" She ran up the path and as she did Zor'El created a land slide. Kara was stopped by three Zoners, she gritted her teeth and charged them. Kara kicked the first man in his knee breaking it then clipped the legs of the second man and the last man was tackled by Zor'El. They struggled and the man stabbed Zor'El in the side, but Kara grabbed him by the head and broke his neck. Kara: \"Father you are injured…\" Zor'El: \"That doesn't matter now… When you reach the summit you will see yourself and several other images pass before you... The great rings move fast, but if you time right you will make it… Return to your body and the glass will shatter… Go no…w… my dau…ghter… Kaaa…ra I… lo… y…u…\" he died in her arms. Kara buried his intangible mind in the mountain then she climbed up to the summit and hid watching the rings as they zipped by, she saw her image flash in the massive glass. Kara calculated the distance and speed by the rotating cylinder rings that were fifty feet wide. They broke apart every fifteen feet leaving a teen foot space to jump in between at her image. Then she had to wait and see when her image would pop up. Ten minutes passed when her image came up again. Kara took three large breaths and dashed from her hiding spot. Kara dove through the rings just as her image came up, her mind reconnected with her body and the glass shattered.[Chapter 13] Scene 13 Supergirl flew through space undetected by the fifty Dujar warships orbiting earth. She x-rayed the ships then she scanned the planet in infrared. She flew to the docks to a scrap metal yard in Metropolis. Workers: \"Its Supergirl…\" They all screamed. Supergirl: \"Gentlemen I need to borrow your chains…\" Worker: \"How many Supergirl?\" Supergirl: \"All of them…\" Supergirl gathered many chains together and melted the ends so that they were linked together. Then she flew up into space with the huge chain trailing behind, She smashed through each warship and spun the entire fleet around and threw them into the sun. Then Supergirl returned to earth and flew towards star labs. Supergirl: \"Professor Hamel…\" Hamel: \"Supergirl…\" Supergirl: \"I need your help…\" The Daily Planet: The press is gathered so that Jax'Ur can address the world, but Laen'Ki whispered into his ear. \"Find out what is wrong fool…\" Jax'Ur returned his attention to the reporters as Laen'Ki flew off. \"People of earth… I am High General Jax'Ur your…\" A whistling sound made everyone look up as Laen'Ki fell into a news truck crushing it and the people cheered as Supergirl floated down out of the air. Supergirl: \"Hi General… I am back.. . care for round two…\" Mala: \"Let me kill her…\" Supergirl flew into Jax'Ur and they smashed through the glass entryway of the Daily planet. He put his feet down and they slid across the floor. They stopped in front of the elevator. She kicked him in between the legs and they wrestled onto the elevator. The doors opened on the editor's floor and Supergirl jumped up and stuck her feet out kicking Jax'Ur onto the floor. Mala bust through the floor of the elevator and grabbed Supergirl, they flew up smashing through the roof of the elevator with the other four Kryptonians following. They came up through the roof and Supergirl grabs Mala by the hair and throws her into the Daily Planet globe. Both she and the globe go rolling across the roof and over the side. She is about to fly off when Xin tackles her from behind and they fly into the adjacent building. As Xin is holding her the other Kryptonian punches her in the face, Supergirl blows her ice breath in his face. She head butted Col'Xin in the face and flew backwards with him still holding her and smashed Xin through the wall and down the side of the building slamming him into the sidewalk. Mala and the last Kryptonian came flying towards her she shot the other Kryptonian with her heat vision and as Mala came up to her they both swung at each other. Their punches caused a shockwave that shattered glass, Supergirl flew backwards flipping and landed on all fours. She looked to watch Mala smash into a bus, it turned over as Jax'Ur landed behind him. Jax'Ur: \"Your good girl… join us…\" Supergirl: \"Your going to have to kill me…\" Jax'Ur: \"If that is your wish…\" She tried to kick him in between his legs but he caught her leg. \"Nice try…\" Supergirl poked him in his one good eye. Jax'Ur howled, bending over and she kicked him in the face. People screamed and Supergirl spun around to find Mala picking up the bus, \"No you don't…\" She flew across the street and tackled Mala who dropped the bus, Mala grabbed Supergirl by the hair and smashed her face into the electric box and threw her onto a car just as the driver jumped out of the car. All four Kryptonians landed at the same time and surrounded her. Jax'Ur: \"Surrender its over… Supergirl…\" She sat up breathing hard and looked at them all, \"You will have to catch me first…\" She flew off the car and into the air with all five Kryptonians following her. She flew as fast she could with them following her across the state, the country landscape north. They followed her to the frozen north where the fortress of solitude lay. Jax'Ur caught with her and punched her in the back, Supergirl went smashing into a spire of the fortress and into the front steps of the fortress. Supergirl stood up and looked at them, \"All right I give up… PROFESSOR NOW!\" He came from inside the fortress and flung a phantom zone crystal at them, \"Noooo!\" They all screamed as they were cast into the glass prison that went spinning into space. Supergirl: \"Thank you professor…\" Hamelton: \"You are quit welcome Supergirl…\" Lex Corp: Linda sneaks in the building disguised as Mercy Lex Luthor: \"Mercy you are here early… If we move quickly we can still get to the fortress of solitude…\" She walks up to him and knees Luthor in the groin, \"…W …hat… arrrrr…you doing…\" She becomes Supergirl in front of him. Supergirl: \"Perhaps I have a little brains aye baldy…\" Mercy arrives and finds Luthor at his desk, \"Lex we are good the authorities can't tie us to the mercenaries…\" Lex Luthor/Supergirl: \"And our FBI friend…\" Mercy: \"He is on his way out to sea… It will look like he got lost and the boat will sink…\" Luthor stood up and punched Mercy knocking her out, then he became Supergirl and flew out the window. The boat was sinking in the sea and Ethan was tied up on the inside. The water began to recede as the boat was lifted into the air and brought to the beach. Supergirl entered the boat and released him from his bonds, they kiss passionately.[Chapter 14] Scene 14 The White House: Supergirl addresses the world with the President at her side: \"Ladies and gentlemen of earth… It is over and you are safe for the time being… You are not alone in the universe and the people of earth need to come and stand together or be left behind in the grand scheme of things…\" Everyone is engulfed in a bright light as a crystal orb descends on the white house front lawn. The diamond shaped ship opened and Superman exited the ship. He hugged his cousin and the people cheered, \"Thank you…\" He whispered to her. They flew off together waving to the people below. Argo two weeks later: Kara and Kal'El walked through the ruins of Argo city, the dead littered the streets and there were no survivors. Kara fell to her knees crying and Kal'El placed a hand on her shoulder. \"You can return with me to earth… There is always a place for you there…\" She smiled, \"Thank you…\" Earth: Ethan: \"I see you decided to stay…\" Linda: \"My people are all dead… Kal'El… Superman is my only family now…\" Ethan: \"I am sorry…\" Linda: \"Would you come to dinner with me… My cousin wants to meet you…\" Ethan hesitated: \"Superman…\" Linda: \"He has another name… Its Clark… and my real name is Kara…\" He kissed her, \"All your names are beautiful…\" Supergirl flies off and into the sunset waving.[Chapter 15] Credits Supergirl/Kara/Linda Lee portrayed by Laura Vanderport Zor'El portrayed by Christopher Lee Jax'Ur portrayed by Ron Perlman The Argo council members portrayed extras who nobody cares about The President portrayed by Danny Glover Superman portrayed by Tom Welling Ethan Bale portrayed by Daniel Goodard Mala portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter Emile Hamel portrayed by the guy from Smallville (Sorry) Dujar warrior designs by ILM Special Effects by ILM Story by jman007 sound effects by Skywalker Sound written by jman007 directed by jman007 Screenwriter: High if you liked or hated my version of supergirl I'd appreciate your reviews… ","Summary":" SUPERGIRL THE MOVIE Originally created by Otto Binder for DC comics Screen play by jman007 Cool sto"},{"Movie":"Supergirl","Title":"The Arrival of Supergirl","Author":"GoldRedeemer","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5399019","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The glowing power source that Kara had been hunting was no longer in her sights. All she could see through the glass of the sphere shaped craft was what appeared to be deep green water, surrounding her, and the craft was heading up, diagonally toward the distant surface. Kara shifted in her cushioned seat with excitement, wondering what kind of world or dimension she would find at the end of her journey. She even wondered if she would possibly meet her cousin Kal- El. Maybe he could even help her to locate the Omegahedron and return it to Argo City. But Kal-EL was on Earth, and Kara was not certain if Earth was exactly where the small ship was transporting her. Faster and faster, it continued to lift Kara up and up. Kara knew very little about Earth, but it had always been her dream to venture there. She had once heard her father speaking about her cousin and the special powers he possessed there. If she also went to Earth, would she have those same abilities? Kara felt the hair on her neck stand up as the water turned to a much lighter green and eventually a medium blue. She stared up through the glass, her nose almost brushing against it. A warm sensation around Kara's body shifted her attention down to the cushioned seat beneath her. The red, yellow and blue blanket material was glowing! Mesmerized, Kara reached down to touch the Kryptonian material, feeling a powerful energy rush through her fingers and up her arm. The feeling was unlike any she had ever experienced in her young life. She felt strong, energetic, and full of confidence as she pulled the entire blanket around her body. Kara was enveloped by a sudden bright flash as the ship sped further toward the light. In place of Kara's Kryptonian gown was a special uniform complete with a long red cape, a red skirt and boots with yellow piping, and a snug, blue top. What appeared to be a stylized red S with a yellow background was designed in the middle portion over Kara's chest. On the back of the cape, another \"S\" was designed, but entirely yellow. Kara's new clothes represented her heritage and background,. Only another fellow Kryptonian would understand this, as no human would. As far as humans would be concerned, if they had seen Kara, more than likely they would associate her with her cousin, known on Earth as Superman, after witnessing a full demonstration of her super powers. The top of the craft began to open, as if it were a blooming flower. Kara braced herself, lifting her arms toward the light above her. She was immersed in energy as the red and blue suit rested on her now indestructible body. Kara had a feeling that the power source was not going to be very easy to locate, but she had to find it. She must find it. With that, Kara stood up in the opening ship and shot up toward the sunlit surface. The lakefront appeared to be deserted, with the exception of a few squirrels and birds, but even they would not have understood what was about to take place. If anyone had been present, he or she would have witnessed a beautiful blonde girl splash upward out of the middle of the lake. But more fascinating would have been the fact that the young woman could defy gravity and wore what looked like a Superman suit for a female. Kara emerged from the lake, landing a bit clumsily on the nearby shore. She took in her surroundings as if she were a small child. \"Such a beautiful world this is,\" she thought to herself. \"Very different from home.\" A large rock rested on brown soil near her. She reached down to pick it up and it was then that she noticed her new clothing. Kara realized that she must indeed possess identical powers as her cousin, so she decided to put it to the test. With the stone in her palm, Kara applied little pressure and it crumbled to dust. Her strength was like that of no other being on Earth, besides her cousin. Kara felt that she was going to enjoy this place very much. All around her were trees and flowers. Back on Argo, Zaltar had created artificial trees and flowers that could have passed as being real. Kara knelt down and picked a sunflower to examine it more closely. As she gazed at the flower, two narrow red beams shot from her eyes to the flower, causing it to bloom! Kara smiled and sniffed the sunflower, enveloped in its scent. When she looked down toward the ground, she discovered that her feet no longer touched the soil. She was floating! \"Oh!\" she gasped. Kara danced around in the air above the forest preserve, doing flips, gliding and soaring. The feeling of not being restrained by Earth's gravitational forces was one that Kara wanted to experience for the rest of her life. To fly as free as a bird. Nothing could top that feeling. Kara landed back on the shore of the lake, gazing into the orange setting sun. She glanced at her Argonian bracelet. It had stopped glowing, which could only mean that the Omegahedron was a good distance away. She began to understand her one purpose here on Earth. Her vital mission to save her world. Argo would not survive long without the power source, and Kara understood the severity. The Omegahedron must be found. A red and blue streak lined the air and Kara's eyes shot up toward the darkening sky. \"Could it be?\" she thought. Her question was answered when the red and blue streak landed a few feet on the ground in front of her. Superman stood before Kara, not speaking, but only staring at her. From what Kara could see, the red and blue clad man appeared to be in a state of disbelief, even shock. Kara extended her right hand toward him. \"Hello,\" she said calmly. Kal-El accepted her hand, suddenly very close to tears. As he stared at the red and yellow symbol on her chest, it occurred to him immediately that this young blonde girl was kin to him. Not only a fellow Kryptonian, but his cousin. The arctic sky appeared to glow a reddish orange , as two super beings wearing identical colored clothing sped toward a large crystal looking structure, with pillars pointing in almost every direction. Kara and Kal-El flew through a secret opening of the Fortress of Solitude, landing in an immense ice chamber. Kara was mesmerized by the beauty of her cousin's fortress. It reminded her of Argo, but in a different way. Kal-El stood close to Kara. \"This is a very special place to me. The only reminder that I have of my real home. Our home. Krypton.\" He turned to his cousin. \"I'm not alone after all . There are other survivors. In inner space. I will do anything that I can to help you, Kara.\" Supergirl gave a grim smile. \"We don't have much time, maybe less than three days, Kal-El.\" She continued speaking. I've come here to Earth to find a power source known as the Omegahedron. Without it, Argo City will slowly perish.\" Superman motioned Supergirl to a separate chamber with walls of pure crystal. A large flat screen monitor was displayed on a far wall inside of the chamber. It flicked to life as Superman approached it. A clear view of the planet Earth was shown. Superman touched a single button beneath the screen, and the Earth made a complete rotation, then halted. \"Zoom,\" said Superman. The picture zoomed in, revealing more detail of lands and cities. A red dot was blinking on and off over an area in the state of Illinois, near the city of Chicago. \"The power source is somewhere in a town called Midvale, not very far from Lake Michigan, where you first emerged to Earth, Kara.\" Superman produced a small hand held device from a tiny compartment in the chamber. \"This is a high energy detector from Krypton. It can detect any source of power not from this Earth. We can track down the Omegahedron with it.\" Superman placed a hand on Supergirl's shoulder. \"Don't worry,Kara. We will find it. Together.\"[Chapter 2] Midvale, Illinois. Not exactly whatnpeople would call a big city, but more of a small town on thenoutskirts of Chicago. Midvale was not known to be fast paced, notnlike The Windy City. It seemed more laid back and comfortable. On anlocal street, a group of children played a game of tag as a whitenCadillac rushed by in quite a hurry. Sitting behind the wheel was anwoman named Selena. To be more specific, the woman was a practicingnsorceress/ witch. She scowled at the children as they ran about innthe street and on the sidewalk. \"Filthy brats,\" she thought. \"IfnI had my way everyday, I'd turn them into gerbils.\" Selenanlaughed at the thought as she pulled into the midway of her GhostnTrain home. Very soon, she would be living much better than this.nMore in style when she would become ruler of all and everything. \"Biancaa? I'm home.\" Selenanwas greeted by the echo of her own voice. She knew that her bestnfriend and fellow advisor was home. She hardly ever left the housenwhile Selena stayed away. \"Biancaaa?!?!\" A woman answered,n\"Whaaaaaaaat?\" in a tired sounding voice. To Selena it soundednmore bored. \"Show your face. I have a surprise for you.\" From hernshawl, Selena produced a diminutive round glowing object, thenOmegahedron! Its new home would be inside of the coffer of shadow,nwhich the power source fit perfectly into. Bianca strode into thenroom, displaying much irritation, complaining about the hot waternbeing turned off. She was a handsome woman, not especially beautifuln, but mildly attractive. \"I figure the only way we're gonna paynour bills next month in this dump is to go ahead and start our ownncoven.\" Selena stood and pranced around thenroom, holding the coffer of shadow in the palm of both hands. \"Nonlonger necessary.\" Bianca grew curious as she watched her friend. n \"What's that you have in the coffer of shadow? And where'snNigel?\" Selena smiled to herself. \"Nigel, my dear, is ancientnhistory. Along with the water department, and everything else. Younname it, dear Bianca! I have finally been chosen. This world willnsoon be mine.\" Bianca puffed on a cigarette, wide-eyed. \"So tellnme. Whats the big secret? I'm your best friend, come on, spill it, nSelena babes.\" Selena petted the coffer of shadownas if it were a tiny kitten. \"No more questions, Bianca. All younneed to know is, I have the POWER.\" She pulled back a dusty rugnwhich concealed a secret compartment that stored Selena's specialnbooks on witchcraft and various magic spells. In the compartment, shenplaced the coffer of shadow. \"The world is at last my oyster.\" On the other side of town, Nigelntrotted along a dirt road near the spot where he and Selena had theirnpicnic earlier that day. Never before had the man felt thisnirritated, besides all of the other times when he was forced to dealnwith the students at a private school for girls in Midvale. Thenlittle glowing ball that had spoiled their picnic was the main reasonnhe was now walking home, still a good ten miles away. Thank goodnessnthat the sun was beginning to set. Earlier he had been drenched innsweat, literally carrying the entire picnic on his back. Anyways, henwould make it home eventually. That little ball. Where had it comenfrom? What was it? Why had Selena become so totally bewitched by it?nThe only way he would find out, would be through Selena. He demandednan explanation. \"The nerve of that bitch to leave me stranded likenthat.\" Nigel knew that Selena was no angel, but he never realizednthe woman could be capable of such cruelty. Once he made it back tontown, he would hail a cab, which made Nigel feel a bit better. Thennext morning he had school, which he was not looking forward to. Butnbeing quite the example setting adult, he would not miss one day ofnteaching his class. A noise above him, in the evening sky interruptednhis thoughts. Nigel stared in bewilderment as twonred and blue forms streaked across the sky faster than a bird. Henknew that one of the forms more than likely belonged to Superman, butnwhom did the other belong to? And.. wait a sec…. Was that a rednskirt? Nigel stood in place for what seemed like minutes as thenflying forms in the sky sped away, leaving the teacher down below tonwonder about what he had just seen. \"Superman must have familynmembers,\" he thought. \"Or a new girlfriend.\" Stillncaptivated by the speeding shapes in the sky, Nigel turned, ncontinuing on his long trek back to Midvale.[Chapter 3] The tiny gem on Kara's bracelet began to glow, emitting a high pitch beeping sound. Kal-El suggested that the two of them should separate to look for the Omegahedron, which would give them a better chance at locating it. \"If you happen to find the power source before I do,\" stated Superman, \"then don't hesitate to immediately return it to Argo.\" Supergirl nodded as she watched him fly off ahead of her. The girl of steel smiled, feeling more than proud to have met her long lost cousin. This world be a complete disaster without him. Supergirl flew high over the city of Chicago, scanning buildings and homes with her Super X-Ray vision. Finding nothing, she decided to land directly in the center of Midvale. Kara strolled down the middle of an abandoned street, admiring the strange looking landscape, building structures, and automobiles. The bracelet on her wrist was glowing stronger now, an indication to Kara that the Omegahedron was indeed somewhere closeby. All of a sudden the glowing ceased, and Kara stopped moving. Again, she scanned a few buildings, only to find nothing of great importance. She turned around, preparing to jump back into the sky when a loud horn sounded behind her, somewhat startling the girl. She turned to face the noise, becoming bathed in bright lights. \"What sort of creature is this?\" Supergirl thought. Whatever it was, it was gigantic, with two round bright bulbs that looked like eyes, and a large grill in the center, as if it were an immense mouth. The thing was moving closer to her, but stopped about fifteen feet away. As Supergirl watched, the lights suddenly died and two humanoid beings emerged from both sides of the interesting looking machine. Both were male, dressed in what appeared to be civilian clothing. They were truck drivers. One of them, who was a bit more pudgy than the other, spoke. \"Now this I like.\" Supergirl stood before the men, sizing them up, trying to determine whether or not they were a threat to her. She decided they were not and smiled, speaking in her most pleasant sounding voice. \"Hello.\" The pudgy man, who wore a jacket, t-shirt and wrinkled baseball cap, glared at the blonde haired girl hungrily. The other man, more lanky and frail than his partner, returned the greeting. \"Well, hello to you sugar dumpling.\" Kara smiled even greater now, happy that she was getting acquainted with Earth humans. \"I was wondering, do you think you can tell me exactly where I am?\" The men looked at one another with fiendish eyes. \"We sure got ourselves a fresh one here. What do they call this place, Eddie? Lovers Lane, isn't it?\" Eddie spoke while chewing loudly on a pink wad of bubblegum. \"You got it, Hilly Billy. Lovers Lane.\" Still, Supergirl did not feel threatened, only somewhat puzzled. \"Oh, well you see what I mean is… this.. city, I suppose. What is it called?\" By now, Billy was standing behind Kara, eyeballing her as if she were on display. He reached down and pulled up her cape. \"Yo, Ed, ya gotta love the great view from back here. How nice is that?\" Supergirl quickly spun around to slap Billy's hand away. \"Stop that!\" The man backed away, raising both hands in a peaceful gesture. \"Heeeey,\" he said almost drunkenly. Both men couldn't help but notice that the young woman wore a suit very much identical to Superman's. Eddie's curiosity got the best of him. \"So are you a good friend of Superman's or something?\" Kara turned back to face Eddie. \"No. I'm his cousin. I'm here searching for the Omegahedron. It's very critical that I find it and return it back to Argo City, my home.\" The men obviously were not buying it, but it made no difference to Kara. She was here on a mission, and she would allow nothing to prevent her from carrying it out. Billy stepped forward. \"Is that so, cutie?\" Once again, Kara turned back to look at the rude man. \"Me and my good buddy, Eddie, are on a little mission ourselves , ya know. We're looking for a good ole time. And you have just gladly volunteered to help us on our 'little mission'.\" Kara felt more than puzzled now. She became totally confused and started feeling threatened, especially during the moment when Eddie stepped up close behind her, stroking her long blonde hair. Surprised by this, she turned to look at his smiling unshaved face. Kara reached her hand up and touched Eddie by the chin. Not only did she touch him, she lifted him completely off of the ground, by his chin! After she released him, Eddie stumbled back, watching his gum fall to the ground. Billy looked on in amusement. \"Well, well! This chick works out. We always love a challenge, baby.\" On Argo City, this type of behavior was uncommon, and never tolerated. Strange beings there are, on this planet. \"Why are you doing this?\" Kara did not want to hurt these men. She was here on a mission of peace. But they left her no choice. Eddie was upset now. \"It's just the way we are, honey.\" He started toward Supergirl. What happened next, could not be explained by either of the men. Supergirl inhaled and blew out a huge whiff of Super Breath, sending Eddie flying backwards to crash through a wooden fence. That ought to teach him some manners. Billy's mouth dropped open. \" This chick is some kind of freak!\" Out of his jacket pocket, he produced a switchblade knife, holding it up at Kara. \"Babe, I gotta tell ya, that was a really bad idea.\" Supergirl glared at him as he circled her on the street with the glittering knife. She didn't have time for this, so she focused a red blast of Heat Vision rays at the knife. Billy felt a searing heat touch the skin of his hand, forcing him to suddenly release the blade. He stared at it in shock, as the ruined weapon rested on the ground. \"Ohh okay,\" Billy said as he attempted to tackle this \"super chick\" to the ground. \"You must really wanna play hardball now. Show me what you got, blondie.\" He stood in a boxing stance, while Kara stood with her back straight, and hands at her sides. She appeared as calm as ever when Billy swung his fist hard at Supergirl's face. The blow would have knocked any ordinary human to the ground with a bloody nose, but unknown to him, this young female was far from ordinary. The girl didn't even so much as flinch when the fist made contact with her face. However, Billy sank to his knees, cradling his right hand, moaning in complete agony. The trucker felt as if he had just punched a solid wall of brick. \"What in the heck are you?\" Billy tried to rise to his feet, attempting to stagger away from the red and blue clad woman. Supergirl responded by turning her back to him. She lifted both of her arms, and jumped into the air, flying away into the starry night. Eddie had seen it also, full of nothing but pure confoundment, but when he shifted his vision back to the ground, he could see his friend lying passed out on the street, apparently having fainted. \"Billy? Hey Billy, I think we should, umm, not tell anybody about this. You agree?\" But Billy only lay sprawled out in the middle of the street, motionless.[Chapter 4] After Bianca had gone to bed, nSelena stayed awake for the remainder of the night, admiring hernnewfound prize. The amateur sorceress remained confident that shenwould soon be in control of the entire planet. The little glowingnsphere seemed much more powerful than she expected. Selena believednthat it had come from a place quite far from Earth. She rememberednhow it had automatically started the engine of her car, back at thenlake, and from that instant, Selena had fallen completely in lovenwith the small sphere. It quite possibly had no limits as far as itsnpower was concerned. It was due for another test run. \"How could something so smallncontain as much power as this?\" She dared not underestimate thenball, but she carried it over toward a white refridgerator, removingnan uncooked chicken. \"We shall soon find out.\" Selena carefullynplaced the meat on a nearby table, then sat down in front of it.nHolding the Omegahedron in her left hand, she placed her left palmnover the cold meat on the saucer. Selena closed her eyes, picturingnthe dish in her mind. The chicken began to cook right before her, asnif it were inside of an oven! Selena opened her eyes, gasping innamazement. The chicken sat on the dish, fullyncooked. \"Astonishing,\" the witch said. She held the Omegahedronnup in front of her, admiring it, a small smile forming on her rednlips. \"I'll say,\" said a voice behind her. Selena whirlednaround to see Bianca standing in a doorway dressed in a purplennightgown. Selena stood, clutching the ball protectively to hernbody. \"How long have you been standing there?\" Bianca grinned.n\"Long enough. Smelt something cooking.\" She turned her attentionnfrom the steaming chicken to the little round object within Selena'sngrasp. \"So, that's what you've been hiding from me huh?\" TonBianca's amusement, Selena began to blush ever so slightly as hernbest friend approached the table. \"That thing is pretty amazing.nHow did it do that?\" Selena placed the Omegahedron backnin its proper place, in the coffer of shadow, while Bianca sat at thenkitchen table sampling the chicken. \"Your little prize there is annoutstanding cook. Who needs a stove anymore, right?\" She stuffednfreshly cooked pieces of meat in her mouth as she spoke. \"Ohhhhh,nI know. Why don't we create a nice little buffet, right now?nCouldn't hurt. Besides, I haven't eaten a thing all day.\" nSelena didn't appear to be listening to her friend. She placed thencoffer of shadow back into the secret compartment under the dustynrug, then laid herself down on a queen size bed, a million thoughtsn and ideas dancing around inside of her brain. She could almostnfeel the energy radiating from the coffer of shadow, directly intonher veins. \"Yes. I can hardly wait. This pretty world is going tonbe all MINE.\" The sudden buzzing of the frontndoorbell shattered Selena's thoughts like glass breaking as Biancanapproached from the kitchen. \"Who on Earth could that be at thisnhour?\" The person on the other side of the front door began tonknock impatiently. \"Selena? It's your beloved mentor.\" A verynfamiliar voice. Selena fiercely rolled her eyes up to her forehead. n\"Don't answer that,\" she whispered. \"Maybe he'll go away ,nseeing that no one will answer.\" Outside, Nigel chuckled. \"Toonlate my dear. I've already heard the sound of your sweet, wickednvoice. There's no way you could possibly have a proper slumber,nnot with that little mystifying ball around you.\" Selena could haventorn out her own hair, but didn't, as she stood up to approach thendoor. She had something in store for dear old Nigel. But in thenmeantime, it would be saved for much later. Maybe he would even knownsomething about her mysterious \"charm.\" Afterall, whenever nNigel wasn't teaching in Midvale, he was a part time warlock. \"What is it that you want, dearnNigel?\" Selena faced the silver haired man as she stood in thendoorway, blocking his way in case he thought of entering. Nigel wasnexhausted, but he did his best at not making it appear too obvious asnhe spoke. \"Well, I won't bother to recap on the way you treatednme back at our romantic late lunch by the water, so I'll just getnright to the point.\" Bianca joined Selena at the door as Nigelncontinued. \"That ball you possess. Where is it, Selena?\" The rednhaired woman shrugged slightly. \"It's safe. What does it matternto you?\" Nigel grinned. \" You don't even know what it is. nSelena, you haven't even managed to grasp a full understanding ofnthe arts of sorcery. You couldn't possibly understand the realnpurpose of that…. ball.\" Selena knew what Nigel was trying tondo, and she refused to fall for it. She wasn't that gullible.n\"Allright then, Nigel. Tell me,\" she said as she folded hernarms. \"What is IT?\" Nigel tried to enter but Selena blocked hisnway. \"I must see it in order to fully determine exactly what it nis. You need me.\" Selena threw her head back and laughed nheartily. \"You're making a complete fool of yourself, Nigel, sonplease go home, before I lose all of my patience with you.\" Thendoor shut in the man's face, but he remained on the stoop. \"I'mnwarning you, Selena, you have no idea what you're getting into.\"nHe began to shout. \"YOU'RE JUMPING INTO THE DEEP OCEAN WITHOUT AnLIFE PRESERVER!\" Selena waited near the door,nlistening to see if Nigel had given up and left. When she heardnnothing, she dug the coffer of shadow from out of its secretncompartment. Her new power toy was safe. No one was going to take itnaway from her, ever. Selena's thoughts went back to Nigel, butnwith great annoyance. She scoffed. \"You think he would have gottennthe hint when I abandoned the old geezer at the lake.\"[Chapter 5] Kara awoke to the sound of birdsnchirping, and the warm feeling of the early sun's rays gleaming onnher face. She sat up to look around, admiring the breathtaking view.n After failing to locate the Omegahedron after half a night ofnsearching, Kara had spent the night on a high grassy cliff justnoutside of Midvale. She inhaled the fresh morning breeze into hernlungs as she admired the skyscrapers of Chicago off in the distance,nbut there wasn't time for any childlike admiration of thesenbeautiful sculptures. Supergirl had to continue with her mission,nso without wasting anymore seconds or minutes, she stretched, nstood up and gracefully launched herself into the air towardnMidvale. On the other side of town, Kal-Elnwasn't having the best of luck himself. He had searched the entirennight without any rest, relying on his superhuman endurance to keepnhimself awake. He flew east over Midvale, spotting an alley downnbelow where Kal-El landed to transform into his civilian suit,nbecoming Clark Kent. He brushed off the dark blue suit and adjustednhis black rimmed glasses as he exited the dirty alley. He wonderednhow his cousin was doing, but he knew that he would eventually meetnup with her again sometime today. Clark didn't worry too much,nknowing that Kara could take care of herself, but she was still verynnew to Earth. Many things she would not know of or understand. In anway, Clark regretted having split up with the girl of steel. He knewnthat she wanted her presence on Earth to remain as a secret. Wouldnshe understand that she would require a disguise during the day, andnnot to allow her super powers to draw unwanted attention to herself? At eight forty seven am, Clarknstrolled down the sidewalk, pretending to read a newspaper. Behindnit, he held a travel size Krypton Energy Detector, trying to get anfix on the lost power source. No luck yet, so Clark continued on,npassing a few people on the street who paid no attention to himnwhatsoever. He turned a corner, almost bumping into a young brunettenwearing what appeared to be a school girl uniform. Clark was relievednthat he hadn't bumped into her, but he did accidentally step on hernfoot. \"Oh my gosh! You're foot! I'm incredibly sorry.\" The npretty girl simply smiled. \"Oh, it's allright, really. I'mnfine.\" Clark tipped his hat to the young woman, wishing her a goodnday. But something suddenly occurred to him. The girl's foot shouldnhave been crushed when he had stepped on it. He stared at her for anmoment, then whispered, \"Kara?\" \"Kal-El?\" Kara smiled, happy tonbe back with her cousin. If he hadn't been on Earth, she would bentotally alone or even lost. Clark was almost dumbfounded. \"Indidn't even recognize you. That \"look \" suits you, uuhhh,….\"n The Argonian female completed her cousin's unfinished sentence.n\"Linda. Linda Lee, for the time I'm here on Earth.\" Linda and Clark sat in a booth of ansmall café called Myra's Kitchen. Kara explained how she came upnwith the idea for her disguise, passing an all girl private schoolnand observing the clothing of the students. Clark sipped on hotncoffee while Kara studied her pancakes, intrigued. Food andnnourishment was very different back on Argo City. When she finallyndecided to eat, she could not stop. The breakfast was delicious,nafterall Clark had recommended the pancakes. The two heroes sat, discreetlynplanning their next move on how they could find what Kara had comento Earth to search for. \"There were some periods during lastnnight,\" Kara said, \"when my bracelet had a fix on the nOmegahedron, but just as soon as that happened, I would lose itnagain.\" She took a sip of cold milk. \"It's as if the powernsource was somehow, turned off, I suppose. But it's not possible.\"nClark thought to himself before responding. \"There's no reason nnot to think that it may have fallen into someone's possession.\"nHe studied the small energy sensor. \"It's probably being kept nor stored inside of a special receptacle. If so, it has to benconstructed from lead. That has to be why the sensor isn't homingnin on the Omegahedron.\" Clark paid for the breaskfast, whilenLinda stood outside, scanning buildings, automobiles and peoplenwalking along the street. Nothing. She felt a firm hand on hernshoulder as her cousin motioned her along. The Kryptonians decided tonsplit up again. It was the best and more hopeful method. \"We'llnmeet back here in four hours.\" Clark stated. \"We will find itnKara. It's here in Midvale, somewhere.\" Kara remained just as optimistic asnKal-El when they parted ways, walking in opposite directions. Shenhad to rely on hope for the sake of Argo, it was all she had. That,nand the help of Superman.[Chapter 6] Ethan Mitchell held nothing but pure repugnance for his job, even though it kept the monthly rent paid for his one room apartment. Never had he imagined that he would end up working a full time job as a window washer. Being more than twenty stories up high each day never seemed to put him on edge, he never possessed a real fear of heights. Besides, Ethan had a spectacular view of downtown Chicago. At twenty-five years of age and single, Ethan still held an optimistic view of his future. He played the guitar professionally and very soon he had plans to start his own solo career in the music business. Having written more than twelve songs already, he would be on the roll pretty soon. He daydreamed while cleaning a scummy window clear with a squeegee, forty- five stories up. He peered through the thick glass into an empty office, probably belonging to a rich doctor or dentist. \"Some people are just born lucky,\" he thought to himself. Ethan failed to notice that the rope on the left side of the scaffold had not been secured properly. Linda Lee walked along the streets of Midvale, now and again glancing at her bracelet. It had been three hours, and still nothing. She refused to give up hope, remembering that her teacher and friend on Argo, named Zaltar, had taught her that. Ahead of her, some miles away, Linda could see the skyscrapers of downtown Chicago. She wondered if Earth also possessed a special type of matter wand similar to Zaltar's, used to create such beauty. It absolutely captivated her. But she had no time to stop and admire the city, and most importantly, Argo City's inhabitants probably had less than three days to survive. As Linda turned away from Chicago, her ears picked up a cry of terror which originated from a good distance away. People continued to stroll past the young girl as she stood in place on the sidewalk, now staring back toward downtown. Linda focused on the distant buildings, using her Super Telescopic Vision to locate the source of the scream. A dark haired young man was in trouble, hanging on to dear life from a scaffold, secured by some type of rope or cable to the top of a high rise building. His screams filled Linda's Super Sensitive ears as if he were right beside her. Without drawing any unwanted attention, Linda Lee ducked into a nearby dead end alley. His face and hands moist with perspiration, Ethan continued to cling on to the rope of the scaffold, with one end of it pointing directly toward the deserted street many stories below. There were no passer bys or people on the street that possessed any idea he was in a very serious predicament. \"HEEEEEEEELLLLP! PLEASE HELP MEEEEE!\" He could feel his sweaty grip on the rope loosening, so he tried climbing the rope to bide him more time in case rescue would show up. But deep inside, he knew that rescue would not be coming anytime soon. Ethan made the fatal mistake of looking down, further inducing his panic. One final time, he screamed as loud as his vocal chords would allow, and that was when he lost his grip on the braided rope. Ethan plummeted towards the Earth screaming in terror. A terror that he had never known before in his young life. Visions flashed before him and mercifully, he suddenly passed out from shock. Thirty feet above the ground, a strong pair of arms clad in blue caught the young man in mid air. Supergirl carried Ethan over her shoulder, flying upward along the tall gray building. She grabbed hold of the scaffold with her right hand, carrying it up to the roof of the skyscraper, setting it near a maintenance shed. In seven seconds she and the unconscious Ethan were back down on the sidewalk near the building. Quickly, Supergirl rounded a corner, changing back into Linda Lee at Super Speed. She knelt down to look at the man she rescued. Linda softly stroked the man's hair and sweaty face as he lay on a bench she had placed his body on. Slowly but surely, Ethan began to come to. Linda gave him room to breathe as he tried opening his eyes. She found him to be very handsome, as the man tried focusing on her very form. Ethan opened his eyes to bright sunlight glaring down on him, but the light was suddenly blotted out by a shape very close to him. As his vision returned, he believed that he was in heaven due to the very bright light, and the extremely beautiful brunette looking back at him with the sweetest smile and the most amazing eyes he had ever seen on another human being. An angel? \"You're going to be allright. There's no broken bones.\" For some reason, Ethan felt paralyzed, so all he could do was return the smile, as if he were a seven year old child. He passed out again. Sirens filled the air a short distance away. Linda knew that they were still some blocks away from her and the dark haired man. He would be well taken care of, so Linda took one last look at his face, and silently fled the area. Some minutes later Ethan opened his eyes to a paramedic and Chicago policeman leaning over him. Behind the two uniformed men, he could see red lights flashing from an ambulance van and two police cars. \"Say, buddy? You allright? What happened to ya? We received some reports of someone screaming for help.\" Ethan had not the slightest clue of what had transpired within the last ten minutes. The last thing he could remember was hanging from the scaffold high above the city. He expected to be singing with the angels in heaven by now, but low and behold, he was alive and well, lounging on a sitting bench next to a bus stop. \"I…I think an….angel… sa….saved my… my life!\"[Chapter 7] Clark Kent stopped at a pay phone just a few blocks away from a Popeye's Chicken fast food restaurant. He produced a shiny quarter from the pocket of his blazer, inserting it into the coin slot of the public phone. He was due at work back in Metropolis at the Daily Planet in two hours, but today he wasn't going to make it. Fortunately, his boss Perry White was out on vacation, which left Lois Lane in charge. More than likely, she would be more understanding than their cigar chomping boss. Inside of the Daily Planet, in Perry White's office, a black phone rang loud enough to wake the dead. Lois had just arrived back from a fast food joint called The Hot Seat. She rushed into the office with a warm paper sack held by her white, almost perfect teeth. She answered the call in her most professional working manner. \"Perry White's office. Miss Lois Lane speaking.\" On the other end, Clark smiled, almost goofily. \"Hi, Lois. It's Clark. Listen, I'm not going to make it to work today. I have to take care of a, ummm, family problem.\" Lois pulled a fresh, wrapped hamburger from the paper sack as she sat down behind Perry White's desk. \"Family problem, huh? Hmmm, you're slipping, ole Clark Kent. But I guess I'll let you slide this once.\" Clark smiled, knowing how much Lois Lane enjoyed giving him a hard time. \"How is everything going there, Lois? Have your hands full, I bet.\" Lois chuckled. \"The only thing I have my hands full of right now, is a large juicy burger. YUMM. Things are fine here, Clark. Just don't stay away for too long.\" Clark was about to respond when the Krypton energy sensor emitted a sudden high pitch beeping! \"Hey, what's that noise, Clark? You at a casino or something?\" Clark adjusted his glasses, holding the phone with one shoulder. \"Uhhh, it's my pager Lois. I've got to go. I'll call you later.\" \"Since when did you have a pa..\" Lois stopped speaking into the phone, realizing that Clark had hung up on her. \"Hmmm, I never knew that Clark carried a pager. Oh well, we all have our secrets.\" Lois laughed to herself as she unwrapped her lunch, intending to devour the delicious looking hamburger. The power source was close, Clark could feel it, and this time he refused to lose track of it again. He jogged in the direction where the signal was strong, knowing that if he used his Super Speed, he would pass up the location of the Omegahedron. So instead, Clark ran at a normal pace. Soon the beeping became a long, monotonous tone. Clark looked around. He was no longer in downtown Midvale, but in a more deserted section of the little town. A small, abandoned amusement park on a midway awaited him, about twenty feet away. Using his X-Ray Vision, Clark scanned the inside of the building painted with the words \"Ghost Train.\" What he saw inside, prompted him to dash toward a small junkyard not far from the midway. There, he changed into his true form of Superman.[Chapter 8] Inside of the ghost train, Bianca stood in a dim corner, watching her best friend, Selena, hovering four feet above the floor. She dared not speak, not wanting to break the red haired woman's concentration. \"My God\" she thought to herself. \"She really IS a witch!\" Selena's black robed body slowly spun Bianca's way, flashing the frightened woman a sinister, red lipped grin. The omegahedron gleamed brightly in Selena's outstretched hand, casting an eerie glow about her. A sudden wind that seemed to originate from nowhere, tore through her long red hair and silk robe. The woman looked absolutely evil. Kal-El knew that Superman would be a much better candidate for the job of convincing the strange earthling to give up the omegahedron than the mousy Clark Kent would. Everyone in the world knew Superman, not Clark Kent, and Superman was known to be pretty persuasive. The floating woman could be dangerous, and Kal-El was not immune to magic. But it appeared that the woman had gained power from the glowing sphere that spun delicately on her right palm. Hopefully, confiscating the omegahedron from the strange woman would be an easy task. \"It seems that we have company,\" Selena stated as she turned to see the red and blue clad figure standing in the entrance of her ghost train home. \"Welcome, Superman. I possessed the strangest feeling you would show up sooner or later, and I must say…. You are much better looking in person than in the newspapers.\" Selena lowered herself back to the floor as the man of steel stepped forward with his arms folded up to his chest. \"Pardon me ma'am, for intruding. But you have something that doesn't belong to you. That, what rests in your right hand.\" Selena glared at Superman, not surprised by his statement. \"Wrong, blueboy. You see, this does belong to me. It was sent to me, bestowed upon me as a gift. You better believe that I'm not giving it up without a good fight. Hahahaha.\" As Selena stood laughing, Superman rushed toward her, almost with the speed of light. The omegahedron disappeared from the witch's hand, now resting in Kal-El's. This prompted Selena to laugh even harder. \"Poor man of steel. Not too bright, are you? Look at what you have in your hands, fool.\" Superman looked down at his left hand, which he thought gripped the small round power source. Instead, he held a shiny red apple, which he squashed into nothing. Selena lifted an arm at Superman, pointing a shiny red fingernail directly at him. \"Never fool with the great Selena, ultimate siren of Endor.\" A lightning bolt shot from her finger at Superman, who cleverly dodged the attack. His patience was wearing thin with this 'Selena', who had more tricks up her sleeve than his other known arch-enemy called Mxyzptlk . \"Enough! There is a dying city which requires the power source for survival. Many lives are at stake! Can you not understand that?\" \"Understand this, Superman. I'll make it very simple for you, even a two year old would understand.\" Multiple images of Selena appeared around the room, making it difficult for Superman to determine which one actually belonged to the real witch. \"Finders keepers, loosers weepers.\" Every one of the 'Selenas' began to chant strange words that sounded very alien to Kal-El. Using his X Ray vison, he scanned through the images of the witch, looking for the true form which contained the vital organs of earthlings. He spotted her, standing very close by. Superman rushed forward, but he came to a sudden, complete halt, as if a solid wall had appeared out of thin air. Actually it was a wall, but a wall of clear, impenetrable glass. Kal-El realized that he had been trapped within what was known as The Phantom Corridor, a doorway to The Phantom Zone. He tried breaking out, but his powers had been completely neutralized by the corridor. Superman watched as Selena strode up to the glass of his prison, smiling ever so sweetly. \"Now, Super spandex. I would send you to a very faraway place, marooning you there forever, to keep you out of my hair. But…. I have something much better in mind. I'm sure you'll enjoy it soon enough.\" Kal-El repeatedly pounded the glass with his fists as Selena and Bianca laughed at him. \"You best behave, or I WILL send you to The Phantom Zone,\" Selena stated. \"Just relax, you'll most certainly love being my personal servant, slave, whatever I wish. Even my lover. Hahahahah!\" Superman sank to his knees inside of The Phantom Corridor. There had to be a way out of this. Kara was still out there. If only there was a way to send her some type of distress signal. But inside of this glass prison, he was powerless. Meanwhile, Linda Lee returned to Myra's Kitchen, where she and Clark had breakfast earlier that morning. She entered the cozy restaurant and sat in a small booth, waiting patiently for her cousin. Somewhat discouraged, she hoped that Clark had been more successful with his hunt for the omegahedron. Maybe he had some type of lead on the power source, which would explain why he still had not returned to the restaurant. Linda waited for nearly an hour and when Clark didn't show up, she became a bit worried. Something must be wrong. She couldn't shake the feeling that something indeed was. The bracelet on her wrist came to life in a glow, causing Linda Lee to stand up from the booth to rush out of the door of Myra's Kitchen. She quickly ducked, unseen, into a large conduit, emerging from the opposite end, dressed in her red and blue suit as Supergirl, flying straight up in the sky like a red and blue bullet.[Chapter 9] Kara's bracelet continued to beep, even as she landed in what looked like an old amusement park. She cautiously approached a set of double doors on a small building beneath a large sign that displayed the words Ghost Train. As Supergirl stepped closer, her foot touched something on the ground, like solid metal. She bent down, seeing the energy detecting device that belonged to Superman. Kara felt even more sure now that her cousin was in trouble. Supergirl stood up to enter the building and without warning, the doors swung open. Superman stood in the doorway, before the girl of steel. \"Kal-El!\" Kara said. \"You're allright! I thought that something happened…\" Supergirl never finished her sentence as Superman's blast of red heat vision struck her in the chest, sending her flying back twelve feet. She crashed into a carousel, destroying a horse made of plaster. Stunned and surprised, Supergirl looked at Superman in utter disbelief. What's happened to you? It's me, Kara!\" She struggled to her feet as Superman began to approach her. Kara faced him, with her back straight, arms at her sides. \"Kal-El, STOP!\" He back handed her so hard that Supergirl flew backward onto the street, striking a curb that crumbled into dust. Superman laughed. \"You're pathetic. You don't deserve to wear that Crest on your chest. Madame Selena, does.\" \"Selena?\" Kara thought. Someone was obviously controlling Superman's mind, maybe with a spell or magic. At Super- Speed, Kara rushed back inside of the park and came to an abrupt halt, standing before her cousin, once again. \"I will not fight you, Kal-El.\" Superman raised his fists over his head, preparing to strike. \"Then die, fool!\" Supergirl acted quickly, delivering a brutal uppercut to Superman's chin. The blow sent him sailing high above the amusement park and the town of Midvale, almost colliding with an airplane. Kara sensed that the real enemy waited for her inside of the Ghost Train, so she entered before Superman came back, wanting to continue the fight. She stepped into darkness. \"Ahh. Another red and blue bird,\" a voice said aloud. Supergirl could see a red haired woman dressed in black, sitting on a gold throne with her legs crossed. In her left hand, there rested something round and shiny. \"The Omegahedron!\" Supergirl rushed forward, but something stopped her, something that she could not see, but only feel. She was trapped, sealed inside of a polygon of impenetrable glass that neutralized her Super Powers. It was the doorway to the Phantom Zone! \"What's the matter, Supergirl? Feeling a little, boxed in?\" At that moment, Superman returned, kneeling before Selena, his mind completely subdued by her control. Supergirl kicked frantically at the glass containing her, as Selena looked on in pure amusement. \"Enjoy your prison, Supergirl, FOREVER and EVER.\" Superman rose to his feet and kissed the red haired sorceress. Kara screamed inside of her glass prison. \"NO, KAL-EL! DON'T DO IT! WAKE UP!\" All at once, everything started spinning. Kal-El and Selena seemed to be moving farther and farther away, and Supergirl realized that the glass prison was departing, up, up, and away. The last sound that she heard was Selena's wicked laughter.[Chapter 10] The spinning glass polygon transported Supergirl away from the Ghost train, away from Midvale, away from Earth. She watched in despair as the blue and green planet disappeared from view. The polygon continued floating away into outer space with Kara trapped inside, helpless. She wasn't sure how much time had passed, but it felt as if she had been trapped for almost an eternity. Kara thought of her mother and father, about what would happen to them if she did not get back to Earth in time. The glass polygon exploded, impacting with solid, rocky ground. Supergirl was thrown to her knees, her red cape flapping about in the wind. She looked up and around, seeing a dark and depressing landscape. There seemed to be no sky, only darkness above her. There were large pools of what looked like dark mud in the rocky ground. Dirt swirled around her. Where was she? Kara stood up. She would leave this place, fly back to Earth to save her cousin and get the Omegahedron back to Argo City. She lifted her arms and jumped into the air, but she only crashed back to the ground. She couldn't fly! Kara made a second attempt to fly away from this awful world, but failed. She picked up a black rock and tried to crush it with her hand, but it fell away, unmarred, leaving her with a bloody palm. She tried testing her other powers, her heat vision, Super Breath, but nothing happened. All of her Super Powers were gone. The wind picked up around her, stronger. Kara pulled her cape around her body, holding herself as she screamed. \"WHERE AM I?\" She was answered by the echo of her own voice. She walked, not sure of where she was heading, but she couldn't just sit around. Somehow, she would find a way to escape, but that seemed impossible without her extraordinary Super Powers. Her once beautiful long blonde hair became dirty and tangled in the dusty wind swirling around her. Her red and blue clothing no longer appeared crisp and brand new, now dirty and torn. Kara continued walking as dirt filled her eyes. She became temporarily blinded, so she lifted her hands to her face, not noticing a large pool of mud right before her. Kara took another step and she stumbled into the loose, oily mud, splashing it in every direction. She cried out in disgust and agony. The agony of being trapped on this lifeless world, of failing her parents and her home. The agony of failing to save her cousin, Superman. Kara crawled through the mud towards the other side of the pool, reaching for the rocky ground. She pulled herself free, laying near the edge of the pool, not wanting to move anymore. Kara closed her eyes and lost consciousness. Back on Earth, Selena had gained total control of the town of Midvale with the help of Superman. With the aid of magic and the Omegahedron, she created an immense castle at the top of a giant cliff in the middle of the town. Everyone in the town was in utter confusion. Selena had created an invisible barrier that prevented anyone from leaving or entering the town. She wanted more slaves and would have them in due time. Ethan Mitchell watched as the chaos unfolded from an alley, trying to stay hidden from Selena's worshippers. He only could think of two things. The woman or angel that had saved his life yesterday, and eluding Selena. \"Oh, my angel,\" Ethan said. \"Wherever you are, I need you.\" Something tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around. He was greeted by the site of a large red S resting on the blue chest of a tall dark haired man. \"Superman! My angel has answered my prayers!\" The Man of Steel grinned at him with the most diabolical smile ever. Ethan had no idea that his nightmares were only just beginning. His angel was a long way from Earth.[Chapter 11] Kara laid on the rocky ground, motionless. Half of her legs were still in the pool of mud, but she did not care. She was not even conscious to realize it. If there were any inhabitants on this world that happened to walk past, Kara would have looked to them like a dirty, blonde haired angel clad in red and blue, banished to this hellish landscape. She certainly looked like she didn't belong here, with her bright colored and cheerful clothing. A figure shrouded in ragged cloth knelt over the girl, turning Kara's body over on her back. She was pulled out and away from the mud pool, and the figure picked her up, carrying her away. When Kara regained consciousness, she found herself in a damp, filthy and dark dwelling. It looked like a cave of some sort, with eerie greenish lighting. She looked down at herself, noticing that her clothes were cleaned of the mud from earlier, but not entirely. She stood up, gasping at something that looked like a rotted skeleton. Kara knew that she was still trapped wherever she was. She still had no powers. There were odd and interesting sculptures all around the cavern. There was something familiar about them to Kara. Something unique. As she thought about this, a hand reached from behind her, reaching out to touch the back of her. Kara whirled around, coming face to face with a rugged looking man, perhaps in his mid fifties. Kara glared at him for a second and then smiled for the first time since she landed on this dark world. \"Zaltar!\" Kara felt slightly better knowing that she wasn't alone here. The man produced a thin dark green bottle that was filled with some kind of liquid, offering it to Kara. \"Squirt?\" he said. Kara only looked at him. \"Zaltar, it's me. It's Kara.\" Zaltar smiled grimly. \"I know. Squirt?\" Kara accepted the bottle, squirting oily liquid in her mouth, but quickly spat it on the dirty floor. \"What is that? Where are we, Zaltar?\" Zaltar took the bottle from Kara's hands. \"Nowhere.\" Suddenly, Kara realized . \"The Phantom Zone.\" \"It's lonely here, my dear Kara. So sad.\" Zaltar had changed a great deal since leaving Argo City. He seemed sad, pitiful, and hopeless, no longer ambitious and full of brilliance. \"I've been here forever, and I shall stay here forever.\" He turned his back to Kara, trotting away as she shook her head in disappointment. \"Zaltar, we have to get back to Earth. We have to get the power source and return it to Argo before it's too late!\" She continued. \"The person who has the Omegahedron tricked me. She's taken my cousin, Kal-El, and she's controlling him somehow, with something called magic. Zaltar, we have to stop her!\" \"She sounds like a force to be reckoned with, my girl.\" Zaltar leaned against a wall, painting symbols from mud. \"There is no way out of here. We are both banished here, for all time. There is no escape. That is the point of the Phantom Zone!\" Zaltar turned to look at the young blonde girl. \"Give up, Kara. There is nothing you can do now. All is doomed, and we will suffer for it, for all eternity.\" Kara was suddenly filled with a burning rage. \"I WILL NOT!\" she shouted. \"I WILL NEVER GIVE UP! I WILL NEVER SPEND MY ENTIRE LIFE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS! I WOULD RATHER DIE FIRST.\" Zaltar gave a half smile in the dimly lit cavern. \"Strong words, my girl, but there are far worse things than dying.\" Kara paced around the room, thinking. \"You always taught me to have pride, Zaltar,\" she said. \"There's always a way out. If there's a way in. there's a way out.\" Kara could see that Zaltar was about to reveal something to her, but he quickly shrugged it off. \"Kara, come. I'm having some company in a short while. My neighbors, banished here like me. Criminals. Zod, Ursa and…\" Kara turned away from him. \"Zaltar, please.!\" He finally gave in, impressed by her courage. \"There is a way. I could do it.\" Kara smiled again. \"Then please, teach me how.\" Zaltar continued. \"There's nothing to teach, girl. No practice. You only get one chance.\" \"Are you sure you won't have a squirt, Kara? Once you get used to it, I think it's delicious.\" Kara bit her lip and took the bottle from Zaltar. \"You're right, Zaltar. Absolutely right. I mean what is the point anymore. There's enough doom and gloom in the air. Accepting defeat is better than taking a chance to try and redeem ourselves by saving our city, Superman, and all of the people on Earth, who are going to be made to suffer by this wicked sorceress, thanks to us. CHEERS!\" Kara put the bottle up to her mouth for a squirt, looking at Zaltar with pleading eyes. \"We could die trying.\" Kara dropped the bottle and rushed up to Zaltar. \"But we won't, Zaltar. We won't. Come on.\" Full of joy, Kara rushed up the damp stairs leading to the surface. Zaltar followed a moment after.[Chapter 12] In a spectacular bathroom inside of the immense fortress, Selena lounged in a grand bathtub, with servants at her side, offering her slices of fresh fruit. Before her, stood a large ,gold rimmed mirror reflecting her image. Beside the mirror, stood Superman, with folded arms. He smiled at his master lovingly, completely unknown of the fact that he was under a spell. \"The world will be all mine,\" Selena said softly. \"No one will stop me.\" Her reflection in the mirror suddenly faded, displaying something else. Selena's eyes grew wide. \"What's going on here?\" The mirror displayed an image of a dark and dirty landscape. As she looked closer, she could make out two figures, one of them dressed in red and blue. \"HER! I won't allow her to escape!\" She slapped a tray of fruit from the hands of one of her servants, furious. \"Bianca! Bring me my Book of Shadows!\" Selena stepped out of the tub, allowing the servants to dry her body. She then stepped into a robe and exited the bathroom with Superman following close behind. Ethan sat helpless in a small cage. He could not tell where he was, but he knew that he was inside of the castle. He heard a voice nearby. \"Boy, I tell you, that Selena is something else. The old dangling in a cage routine. How pathetic.\" Ethan turned to see a man dressed in a dirty suit locked in a separate cage. He recognized the man as a math school teacher in Midvale, yet he looked, different. As if he had aged by twenty years. Selena had cast some type of spell on him, causing him to look as if he was rotting, or decomposing. It definitely didn't look pretty. Ethan began to panic. \"I have to get out of here. I have to find my angel.\" Ethan was an expert at picking locks. Lucky for him, there was a paper clip in his shirt pocket. He took it out and desperately set to work, intent on escaping. In the Phantom Zone, Kara and Zaltar struggled against the fierce winds. It seemed as if the wind had picked up even more now, blowing dirt all around. Kara stumbled and fell, but Zaltar caught her, lifting her back to her feet. \"We must press on, girl!\" Kara shouted above the howl of the wind. \"How far is it, Zaltar? How far? We have been walking forever!\" Zaltar pulled the girl along. \"We're approaching the Quantum Vortex! This is it, Kara! Are you ready?\" Kara's hair whipped around her face. \" Zaltar, I'm scared!\" They came to a rocky, steep mountain. \"Accept your fears! Confront your demons! You will win, girl. You will win! CLIMB!\" Kara and Zaltar edged their way around the mountain, tightly gripping the rock so that the wind would not take them. There was so much wind. It seemed as if escaping would be impossible, but they kept climbing. Soon, Kara could no longer see the base of the mountain. Instead, she saw a red and blue maelstrom, swirling fiercely beneath her and Zaltar. Kara climbed, scraping her bare knees against jagged rock, as her cape flapped around her. \"Zaltar, I can't!\" He reached for her. \"You can!\" His hand grabbed hers and they clung to each other, fighting against the savage wind. The ascent continued and soon, Zaltar pointed to something at the top of the mountain. Kara could see an intense bright light blazing out of a large circular hole. The way out! Excited by this, Kara and Zaltar climbed faster.[Chapter 13] \"Ahh. This is what I want!\" Selena had changed into a sparkling white gown of silk, now sitting before a very big book of spells in a large dining room of the castle. Bianca stood at her side, glaring at the magic mirror. Superman stood nearby watching the scene unfold in the Phantom Zone. \"Selena ran a long red nail along a page of her magic book. \" Thesalian Fireballs!\" She began her spell by chanting strange words while glaring at the mirror with the Omegahedron closeby in the coffer of shadow. Kara continued climbing, with Zaltar at her side. They were almost there, not much farther to go. The white light shined brightly down at them, as if inviting them toward it. Something large and searing hot blazed out of the bright light of the hole, sailing past the two of them. \"What was that?\" Kara asked aloud. Another fireball shot toward them, just over there heads. A third grazed Zaltar's shoulder, causing him to loose his grip on the rock. Kara screamed and grabbed his arm, but he slipped from her grip. Luckily, he was able to grab hold of part of her cape, and Zaltar climbed back up, once again clinging to the rocky mountain. Selena began to panic. Supergirl was getting too close. Something had to be done right here and right now. She flipped through the book for a more powerful attack. Bianca urged her on. \"Better find something and fast, maybe like an Atom Bomb?\" Ethan continued his attempt at picking the lock on his cage. He had been at it for nearly a half hour, but he wasn't ready to give up just yet. This wasn't a very simple lock to pick, but he would continue trying anyway. It was better than just waiting around. Nigel looked on with interest. \"You'll never get free, Johnny Appleseed,\" he said. \"These cages are locked by a spell.\" There was a soft click and the lock sprung open. \"Hmmmm,\" Nigel said. \" I stand corrected.\" Ethan pushed open the door of the cage and jumped out. Nigel grabbed the bars of his own cage, shaking them back and forth. \" How about me, Johnny Appleseed?\" Ethan turned to face him. \" Only if you'll stop calling me that, old man.\" Selena seemed to be out of breath as she stopped flipping the pages of her book. \"I found it,\" she panted. \"Summoning the Demon Storm!\" Bianca looked on with a big smile, as did Superman. \"Higher girl! Higher!\" Zalter pushed Kara up higher on the mountain. She could feel the heat from the blazing white light. \"Come with me, Zaltar!\" He shouted behind her. \"I AM WITH YOU! ON GIRL!\" Soon, Kara sat at the top of the mountain before the blinding light. The heat was intense. She looked back for Zaltar, but he was not behind her. The man clung to a cliff, ten feet down. He was too tired to continue on. His goal all along had been to aid Kara in reaching the exit of the Phantom Zone. He had succeeded in his mission. Now, he could just let go. Kara screamed as Zaltar was taken from the rock by the mighty wind of the vortex. His body whirled around and around in the air before he was sucked into oblivion. Kara sat there, mourning her friend and mentor. Zaltar was gone, but not forgotten. She would have to save her tears and grief for later. A look of sheer determination formed across her young face. Kara turned toward the bright light, Slowly she began to stand before it, raising her arms, like a bird preparing to take flight. She stood so close to the intense light that it seemed to burn into her. She could feel her Super Powers returning to her body. YES! The scar on her palm was disappearing. The inhabitants of Argo city were going to survive after all, because Supergirl had been born, once again. She dived into the bright light, leaving the Phantom Zone behind.[Chapter 14] Ethan and Nigel crept silently down a long corridor with marble floor and glass sculptures lining the walls. As Nigel glanced at the figures of the sculptures more carefully, he realized that they were of Selena. \"We have to somehow remove that magic ball from her possession,\" he whispered to Ethan. \"The woman has gone insane ever since it landed right on our picnic.\" Ethan turned to look at him. \"You're what?\" Nigel brushed him off. \"Oh, never-mind, let's just keep moving. We have to find her before I rot away into nothing.\" Neither men realized that they were under surveillance, by a familiar red and blue clad figure standing just on the other side of the corridor. Supergirl flew at an incredible speed through a dark blue dimension, her blonde hair and red cape streaming out behind her. She had succeeded in escaping her prison of the Phantom Zone, but her mission was not yet finished. This Selena person still had to be dealt with, not to mention saving Superman and the Omegahedron. Supergirl crashed through a large panel of glass, realizing that she had been trapped inside of Selena's mirror. Shards of glass littered the floor of Selena's grand dining room. Bianca jumped, taking cover behind a pillar near the wall. Selena gasped and dashed for the coffer of shadow and her Burundi Wand. Supergirl landed in the middle of the dining room, turning around to face the wicked Selena, who stood about fifteen feet away, holding her grotesque looking wand. Kara stood with her hands on her hips and red booted legs spread apart. Her uniform looked brand new again, her blonde hair shined as if it were in sunlight. The red and yellow crest displayed on the chest of her blue shirt seemed to gleam with exuberance. The young girl from Argo City literally glowed from head to toe. \"It's over, Selena!\" Kara said in her most confident voice. \"Playtime and games have ended!\" The witch smiled. \"Oh, bluebird. Far from it. You may have managed to escape your prison, but you'll never be able to defeat me now.\" She raised the Burundi wand. \"I have the power, girl!\" Suddenly, Superman entered the dining room, holding Ethan and Nigel in each hand. Supergirl whirled around, immediately recognizing Ethan as the man she had saved from falling to his death. \"One false step, Supergirl, and I'll have my boy in blue, snap these two!\" Selena threw her head back and laughed as Superman lifted the two men up by their throats. Kara had to act quickly, before her cousin snapped their necks. \"I'm sorry Kal-El,\" she said. \"But I can't allow you to kill innocent people.\" Supergirl directed a beam of heat vision from her eyes to Superman's foot, burning it. The man of steel dropped both Nigel and Ethan, clutching his foot, obviously in pain. At Super Speed, Kara gathered up the two men in her arms, flying them to a far corner of the large room. \"You will be safe here. No more harm will come to you.\" With that, Supergirl sped back toward Superman, executing a sleeper hold grab on him. \"Kal-El, you must wake up. Selena has you under a spell! You can resist her! WAKE UP!\" Supergirl was thrown off by the Man of Steel, crashing into a pillar. Slightly dazed, she quickly jumped to her feet, standing ready for Superman. He approached her, clenching and unclenching his fists, ready to pulverize Kara. \"I'm going to crush you, once and for all!\" He was suddenly upon her and he raised his fists to deliver the fatal blow. He struck, leaving a hole in the floor, but Supergirl was suddenly behind him. She grabbed him by his red cape, spinning him around and around at such a speed that a red tornado had formed. All of a sudden, Kara released Superman. He sailed through the walls of the castle as if they were nothing but paper, and out into the sunlit sky. \"Now,\" Kara said to Selena. \"The Omegahedron. \"I have come for it. I want it!\" Selena simply ignored her and continued laughing. \"Ohh, quite a show. I must say, it was a delight to watch. Ohh dear Bianca, do come here.\" Bianca approached, holding a small box made of lead. Supergirl quickly turned, ready for anything, but she wasn't fast enough. The box opened, radiating an intense green light. Supergirl gasped, suddenly experiencing great pain and growing weak. \"Noooo,\" she breathed, now on her knees. \"Yes, my dear,' Bianca exclaimed. \"Kryptonite! Just for you, honey. Please enjoy it. HAHAHAHAHA!\" Selena joined in with her own laughter. \"You're finished Supergirl!\"[Chapter 15] Kara had thrown her cousin with such mighty force that Superman went sailing through the solid walls of Selena's castle, and out over the town of Midvale. The Man of Steel ended up landing in a heap on the shore of the exact same lake that Supergirl emerged from to Earth. Nearly dazed from the rough landing, Kal-El, in a steaming rage, jumped back into the sky, leaving a few stunned fisherman and citizens on their picnic, behind. They stared in awe at the red and blue figure speeding away, faster than a jumbo jet. Supergirl's energy was draining at an unbelievable rate under the green rays of the deadly Kryptonite. She could barely hear the awful laughter of the two women, Selena and her partner in crime, Bianca. Kara's consciousness was fading fast and the green rock would surely kill her, unless someone intervened. If only Superman could just snap out of his weird trance, but that was impossible. Despite their incredible super powers, Kal-El and Kara were not invulnerable to magic. An explosion rocked the castle, knocking Selena and Bianca off balance. They both stumbled, falling to the marble floor of the immense chamber. The green Kryptonite rolled away from Bianca, who in surprise gasped, \"Ooops!\" Ethan lunged for the Kryptonite, only to come face to foot with Selena, who had placed her white pump over it, preventing him from obtaining the rock. \"Not so fast, handsome.\" Once the dust cleared, an additional hole in the castle walls was visible, along with Superman, who stood in the opening with a look of pure hatred on his face. Nigel watched, realizing that Superman would once again attempt to destroy the blonde haired girl. Even though she was no longer exposed to the green radiation, Supergirl was still weak, but steadily recovering. A visible, thin coating of perspiration glistened on Kara's face. Nigel had to move fast, or all hope of stopping Selena would be lost. \"Destroy her!\" Selena shouted to Superman, who in response, grinned. He approached his teenaged cousin, who rested on her knees, attempting to stand. Supergirl was suddenly on her feet, held from her neck by the deadly grip of Superman, who cocked his other fist back. Supergirl could barely speak, but she tried anyway to somehow reach her cousin. \"Kal-El, nooo,\" she breathed. As Superman prepared to deliver the death blow, his fist suddenly froze! A puzzled Selena shouted, \"What are you waiting for? Finish her!\" Kal-El, with a bewildered expression on his face, released Supergirl. \"Kara?\" He knelt down beside her, putting his arms around her shoulders as Selena watched, horrified. She whirled around to see Nigel standing beside her gold throne. In his hands, she could see a small empty nutshell that once contained the black spider that completed the spell cast over Superman. Selena was livid. \"You fiend! HOW DARE YOU BETRAY ME?\" Nigel only smiled in reply. ","Summary":" The glowing power source that Kara had been hunting was no longer in her sights. All she could see "},{"Movie":"Where the Wild Things Are","Title":"Alexander Ruminates, or The Goat's Tale","Author":"Quod scripsi","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6628371","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dear Reader, Thank you for visiting. Alexander is my favorite Wild Thing - I'll just get that out of the way right up front - and the purpose of this story is to share the awesomeness of Alexander with fellow WTWTA enthusiasts. However, even if Alexander is not your favorite Wild Thing I think you may still enjoy this retelling of the story (with a few added details) told from his point-of-view. I ask that you please consider posting a review, whether good or bad, as I very much want to know what you think of the story. To the best of my knowledge it is not necessary to sign up or log in to post a review. Thank you and I hope you enjoy \"Alexander Ruminates\". Disclaimer: I did not create nor do I claim ownership of any of the characters mentioned in this story, and rights for all Wild Things no doubt belong to Mr. Sendak, Mr. Jonze, Mr. Eggers, Hr. Hanks, Warner Brothers, Legendary Pictures, Village Roadshow Pictures, Play tone, their lawyers, their lawyer's wives and husbands, their lawyer's wives' and husband's tennis partners and many, many other people. I own nothing. Much of the storyline is a retelling of Spike Jonze's movie as told from Alexander's point-of-view but I have added a few details not seen in the movie and taken some liberties with the characters.[Chapter 2] If you really want to hear about it (and with my luck you probably don't) the first thing you might want to know is where I was born, and what my kidhood was like, and about my parents and so on. Well join the club, because that makes two of us. I really want to know all that David Copperfield crap about myself, but I don't even know if I had parents or a kidhood. Never mind if I wonder \"whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or if that station will be held by anybody else\"; I just wonder where in the hell I came from and why I don't know things I should know but know other things I shouldn't. There's just never a third-person omniscient narrator around when you need one. Typical. But if I'm going to do this writing I've got to start someplace, and since I don't really know where to begin I'll just start with something basic. My name is Alexander and I'm a Wild Thing. Well, I'm not completely sure about that. Not the part about my name, I mean about being a Wild Thing. I'll try to explain. As far as I know I am a Wild Thing, but since I'm not altogether certain what a Wild Thing is how can I know for sure if I am one? But if I'm not a Wild Thing, than what am I? You'd ask that question too, if you ever met me. Whoever said \"know thyself\" could have been a bit less cryptic and a lot more helpful and provided at least a few basic clues how best to crack that little chestnut of an aphorism. Seriously, shouldn't a major philosophical cornerstone be something more than a sound bite? I do better with \"I think, therefore I am\" but that's not really the issue. I'm not questioning my existence, just by origins and taxonomy. Of course I was created – but by whom, and to what end? This crisis of identify is a recent development, and if a certain person hadn't stumbled into my world I might never have wandered down the yellow brick road of self-awareness. But now that I've nibbled on fruit from the tree of knowledge, so to speak, I want to try for a bigger bite of the apple. I'm just not sure how to go about it. Hopefully this writing will help me sort things out. Another reason for this writing is because I sometimes have trouble remembering the way things were before. Sure I remember the recent past, but all the time before Max seems almost like waking from a dream or recovering from amnesia. But it can't have been amnesia since I never forgot who I am, or anyone else is, or ended up on a soap opera or anything. It's not easy to explain, and just being able to write things down is comforting. \"Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart.\" That's Wordsworth. I guess he really knew the worth of words, given what they called him and all. Getting back to Wild Thing; when I see a cat I know it's a cat, and when I see a dog I know it's a dog (by the way don't feed the dogs, they'll only follow you around). But when I see my reflection in the pond I don't know exactly what I am. I'm the only one of my kind there is. In fact, all the Wild Things are like that – just one of each of us. Honestly, accept for KW one each of the others is more than enough for me, thanks very much. If Wild Thing isn't a species, what is it? How can each of us be a Wild Thing when we're all so different from one another? I guess you've figured out there are others here with me (I'll tell more about them later). Is Wild Thing just a generic label of convenience or is it intended to actually describe us? If so, what is being described? Our physical characteristics? Behavior? State of mind? Diet? Emotional quotient? Tendency to ask too many questions? My guess is some combination of all these things. Or maybe something completely different. Who knows. The Wild Thing FAQ hounds me like…like…well, like a hound I guess, and uncertainty stalks me like…a…big…stalking thing (damn I need to work on my similes). But the answers are conspicuously MIA. It reminds me of the little blurry specs I see when looking into bright light; try as I will to bring them into focus they scurry to the edge of my vision and remain fuzzy, indistinct specs of who knows what. I think they're actually in my eye but they might as well be a mile away, for all the good it does to try and see them clearly. Why is life long on questions and short on answers? Honestly, I've never thought of myself as particularly wild. Sure I've been wild and woolly once in a while, sowed a few wild oats and even played the wild card when it suited me, so I suppose the saying \"wild is as wild does\" may apply a little. But wildness is in the eye of the beholder, and one thing's wild is another thing's mild. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the search for truth and meaning would end up a wild goose chase. I sure loaded up on sayings and idioms in that paragraph, but now that I've written it wild horses couldn't get me to change it. I'm not wild about editing. So where did we come from? None of us knows, although we do have a few theories pieced together from dreams and things that just come to us. Douglas has the odd notion we were all supposed to have been horses. Ira thinks we used to have different names which are now forgotten. And I have a reoccurring dream in which a strangely familiar but far away voice says \"all are my family – all accept goat boy, of course\". Even in my dreams I get no respect, I tell ya, no respect! As I said, I don't remember being a kid (but if I was a kid bet I was adorable), and can't really recall a time when I was much younger or any different than I am now. Of all the things I don't know not knowing the beginning of things is particularly frustrating. I'm not talking about a general which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg beginning of the universe or anything (and obviously the chicken came first, that's a no-brainer), but about my beginning, and of the other Wild Things here with me. It's like walking along the beach on a foggy day and trying to see waves on the horizon before they reach the shore. I just can't do it, no matter how hard I concentrate. I can see the waves breaking on the shore and know they existed long before, and at a greater distance, but the unrelenting mist conceals all but the nearest. Of course it's easy to do on a clear day but that sort of ruins the analogy, and I couldn't think of anything else. So by all means, call me a Wild Thing. Or a Wildish Thing. Or the Thing formerly known as Wild - but of course then you'll have to call me by this little symbol: ©. After all, what's in a name? Better yet, just call me Alexander. Please don't call me Alex, or even worse, Alec. My name is Alexander. Yes I know my name, but don't when and by whom it was given. That remains a mystery, as does the source of many of the things I know; in fact, most of the things I know. It makes no sense not to know where I came from or even much of my past yet have knowledge of places and things I've never actually experienced. True, much of that knowledge is sketchy and incomplete, but it's still pretty amazing. Sometimes I wonder if my brains were cut out and mixed up with brains of other beings from distant places, then poured back into my head while I was sleeping. Just thinking about it sends a shiver down my back, from the tip of my horns to the soles of my feet. I should mention that having my brains cut out is one of my worst fears. But if it did happen I guess it wasn't so bad, since I don't remember it. Thanks Max, for putting the idea into my head – I really appreciate it! By the way that last thing I wrote is called sarcasm. I like sarcasm because it's easy to do and really get's the point across. I'm trying to explain that I and the others have what we call \"mysterious knowledge\" (MK for short). We don't understand where it comes from or why we have it (unless I'm right about the brain mixing). Really, much of it arrives in dream form. We all dream a lot – some are lucky, some are not. At other times things just pop into my mind in response to something I see or hear, or even for no apparent reason. It's very interesting but also a little frightening. Even Wild Things can be afraid of the unknown. Along that line, I know about someone called Durkheim who hypothesized a collective consciousness, and someone else called Jung who theorized about the collective unconscious (you'd think they might cancel each other out). Here at least the mysterious knowledge may have explained itself to some extent. Sometimes at night I see what look like stars falling from heaven; maybe the knowledge falls on us the same way. I don't know. One thing I do know is that what had been a trickle of MK turned into a flood once Max arrived, so it's clearly linked to his world, and apparently even to Max himself. Just wish I understood how. I can almost hear you say \"there are more things in heaven and earth, Alexander, than are dreamt of in your philosophy\". Don't I know it![Chapter 3] Returning to my name; I know it's derived from the Greek, Aléxandros, which roughly means \"protector of men\". But I'm not really sure what Greek is. And until very recently I knew almost nothing about men. Mysterious knowledge can be frustratingly incomplete and often without context. Before Max arrived I had only a vague, shadowy idea of men, compliments of MK. Greek is still Greek to me, to borrow from the bard (that's not MK, everyone everywhere knows about him ), but not so of men. I now have direct knowledge of men. To be more precise, in the singular: about a man. Really a man-cub, also called a boy. But a boy is a kind of a man. Writing is new to me and I've already gotten things out of order and mentioned Max several times before he comes into the story. I'll definitely tell more about him later. After all, it was Max's arrival that motivated me to do this writing in the first place. Max plays a big part in much of what I plan to write so I guess in a way you could call this a record of Max. No, that doesn't sound right. Just call it Max's record. Yeah, that's better. I learned new things while Max was here – good and bad things – and also finally understood some of the things I already knew. For instance, I now realize my name is ironic because I didn't do much to protect Max while he was with us. I hate to admit it but I was snarky to him a few times and even tried to make trouble once or twice. I'm still a little ashamed when I think about some of the things I said and did. If only I could have a second chance – I'd do many things differently! I wonder if anyone else has ever felt that way about anything. I did try to protect him a little near the end, but I could have done more. I should have done more. Before continuing I suppose it makes sense to provide some basic information about myself. I'm male but as you've already figured out, not a man. I'm also not really an animal, at least not any sort of animal that has even been classified. But than again since I'm neither vegetable nor mineral I guess I am technically an animal. As for age, I don't know how many years I've lived, but I'm still young. Call me a young adult. Judith says I can be very immature but I don't think she was talking abut my age. Hell, I might as well be honest. Yes, I can be immature and it's something I really want to improve. My physical appearance has been called goat-like, and of course everyone knows that a goat is \"any of various hollow horned, bearded ruminant mammals of the genus Capra\" to cite the definition. At least I know it. Unlike an actual goat I stand upright and walk on two legs, not to mention being able to think, speak and write. I do have two rather impressive curved horns but can't tell if they're hollow – and I hope to God never to find out. I am bearded and my fur is grayish-white, somewhat shaggy, and conveniently extra long in a certain strategic location that needs no further comment. Ruminant suggests vegetarianism, but since that brings up a thorny topic I'll just skip diet for now. Mammal hints at sex but that's getting a bit too personal, although I opened the door by declaring myself male. And yes I do know \"Wild Thing\" is a euphemistic song by something called a Tone Lōc, but if you think I'm going to write about that sort of wild thing you can just guess again. But I am male, trust me. Mammal also suggests live birth, but sadly I have no maternal mammary memories. Also unlike a goat I have forward looking binocular vision and I think my eyes look more human than anything else. Real goats have eyes more on the sides of their heads which I think is a little creepy. Goats can also be quite ornery and I don't think that applies to me at all. Maybe I seem irritable now and then, but really, I'm actually quite sunny on the inside. Now if you want to see an ornery Wild Thing just wait because I'll tell you about Carol a little later. I suppose I'm about six feet tall, but our only unit of measurement on the island is a Douglas and since I don't have a handy conversion chart I can't really say how tall that is; probably tall for a man but short for a Wild Thing. I'm pretty sure my astrological sign is Capricorn, but I don't really take much notice of all that zodiac stuff. Besides, the idea of a sea goat just sounds too fishy to me. Just thought I'd toss it out there in case you find that sort of thing interesting. Capricorns are supposed to be self-conscious and timid while still craving attention, so just looking at me should tell you how phony it is. Anyway, Max kept calling me a goat, and being called a goat really used to get my goat, but it doesn't bother me anymore. Especially since I know about something written in an important book called the Bible. In one part a prophet named Daniel wrote about a he-goat and his horn (guess he only had the one – the goat I mean, not Daniel), and the goat represents a kingdom and the freaky uni-horn a king called Alexander the Great (supposedly a real king), who conquered just about everybody when he wasn't much older than what I probably am now. I'll bet everyone listened to him. It's an interesting connection to my name and appearance, so now being called Alexander the Goat is fine with me, assuming Alexander the Great was a true king and not just regular. By the way, I don't know the origin of the idiom \"gets my goat\" as used to express irritation, but feel free to look it up. Not to brag, but I'm fairly intelligent. Even Carol once said so and he never says anything nice about me. Now that I think of it he actually said I'm too smart for my own good. Wait, was he being sarcastic? This might also be the right place to point out that it's not impossible to be both intelligent and gullible. It'll make sense later when I tell about our first meeting with Max. Thinking of that, if anyone ever claims to have a double re-cracker I suggest you demand to see it on the spot. Please learn from our mistake. It's not easy to describe myself when there's so much about me even I don't know or understand. Honestly, I wish I didn't care about knowing these things. Ignorance is bliss, and all that. I think I'm fairly interesting just on my own, but since I've inherited so many bits and pieces of knowledge from who-knows-where I'm even more so. It's a cliché but I'm definitely one of a kind. Well, the others also have mysterious knowledge, so I'm not one of a kind in that way. I'm not like the others in most other ways. Not just physically, I mean in other ways, too. Skip it, I don't know how to explain. That's all I can think to tell about me for now. If anything else comes to mind I'll just put it in later. But just to tie up a few loose ends, I realize my knowing things I shouldn't know may not be easy to accept, but that's just how it is. If it bothers you think how it makes me feel! But I'll bet many people know things without knowing how they know them. Anyway, if by some chance you're familiar with the term \"willing suspension of disbelief\" it might make things much easier. I'll try to keep this writing orderly and logical but please be patient if I sometimes get things out of order or digress now and then. Don't stand up and start yelling \"digression!\" at me because for one thing I won't hear you, and for another if I could hear it wouldn't help me in the least. Cut the goat some slack. Because this writing is partly to help me make sense of things I really hope it ends up a factual, organized account and not some sort of non-traditional, hallucinatory Spike Jonze-type narrative. Just because I live on a mysterious secluded island in an uncharted ocean, possibly in another dimension, or even as a figment of someone's imagination doesn't mean I can't at least try to figure out my place in the universe. I'm jonzing for some truth! Like I said, writing is new to me. I didn't even know I could write until I saw Max making marks in the sand with his scepter and asked what he was doing. He explained about letters and writing, and to everyone's surprise I picked up a stick and started writing as well. I actually wrote \"Max, owner of this world\" which just came to me out of the blue. I guess at the time I was still trying to please Max in the hope he would be my friend. Max's language is called English and he said I and the others are probably speaking a different language called Wilderian, and that in an amazing coincidence the two are exactly the same. That sounded right to me because I remembered something about a Kang or Kodos coming up with a theory of duplicate languages. I think it was called the Simpson Theory. Anyway, it's not important and I only mentioned it because something popped into my mind about a problem if a fox reads this. Silly because I don't know if anyone will ever read this and I don't think the foxes on the island even know how to read. The mechanics of writing are a bit difficult given that I have large claws rather than actual fingers, so once I write something down it's going to have to stay written because editing is too much work. \"Quod scripsi, scripsi\" and all that. When I asked Max how to improve at writing he said a teacher told him to remember \"there is no good writing, just good re-writing\", but I'm pretty much going to ignore that. After all, this writing is for me, to work through things, so if this ends up as one of those horrible stream of consciousness things, so be it. Besides, I don't know if anyone will ever read it. But I'm pretending someone is reading because it helps me concentrate, and I really like the idea of being listened to and not interrupted. Max told me about paper and after trial and error I was able to make a few sheets by taking thin strips of sticks and soaking them in the pond for a few days, then pressing the mushy mess together and sleeping on top of it to make it flat. Then I trimmed the sheets with my sharpest claw and dried them in the sun. I'm very glad the sun didn't die. Gee, Max, I really appreciate your telling us it will die someday. Yes, more sarcasm, I do love it. By the way paper is really delicious and I ended up eating about half of what I made. It's high in fiber, too. Pens can be made by heating the pointed end of a stick in the fire, but each one only writes for a little while so I had to make a ton of them. Luckily I'm good at finding sticks. Oh, if anyone ever attacks you with a pointed stick you can use fresh fruit to defend yourself, unless you happen to have a revolver handy. Another reason I'm not changing this writing is because I never figured out how to make an eraser. I tried using a slug once but it made one hell of a mess. Is it normal for my claws to start to ache about now? I wish there was some sort of machine to make writing easier. Maybe I'll try to build something. For some reason apple tree sticks come to mind. But there are plenty of other kinds of sticks that might work, down in the dell. But I think apple tree sticks are just superior.[Chapter 4] I've mentioned a few of the others here with me, and I should probably tell more about them. They are the other Wild Things on the island, and we are seven: Gilligan, the Skipper too, the millionaire and his wife, the movie star, the Professor and Mary Ann. I'm the Professor. Carol can be Mary Ann. Just kidding. I guess that last bit could be a goat pun…but it's not. I'm just giving another example of the spectacularly useless bits of info that, for some reason, I have in abundance. But what the hell is a Gilligan? Did I mention I like to joke around? Yes, this writing project is serious but I plan to try and have some fun with it. I have a pretty good sense of humor; I have to in order to deal with the others and constantly being belittled and ignored. I swear it's a miracle I'm so well-adjusted and still sane. By the way, I wrote a few knock-knock jokes about the others; maybe I'll tell them later. I think our island is amazing, almost like a mini continent. It has spectacular diversity of scenery – verdant forests, sandy beaches, arid dunes, rocky canyons – and all within convenient walking distance. It even has a really cool giant red rock thingy in the middle. There are other non-Wild Thing animals here with us, but really they're like extras. Oh, Douglas has a cat named Timber. He's a good cat. As I was saying, there are seven in our…herd? Or is it pack? Colony, drove, pride, murder? What is the collective noun for Wild Things? I'll go with tribe. So, seven in our tribe: Carol, KW, Judith, Ira, Douglas, the Bull and yours truly. I guess we're a family of sorts, although we're more different than alike. KW says we put the fun in dysfunctional. I want to tell more about the others but I'm afraid my own likes, dislikes, prejudices and experiences may creep in. However, I'll do my best to be dispassionate, factual and unbiased. Carol is an obnoxious jackass. Not that he looks like a donkey, because he doesn't, but in that he sometimes acts like an unadulterated, first-class, dyed-in-the-wool jackass. Unlike some of us he doesn't resemble any animal I can think of, unless a hideous troll is an animal. He is very tall, extremely strong and surprising agile given his size. To be fair, when it comes to designing and building things he has some talent. Apparently he built an impressive model city but has not offered to let me see it (not that I wanted to). I suppose Carol has a few good traits but I've rarely experienced any of them, and most of the time he just ignores me. And that's OK because frankly he scares me a little. Katharine (or KW as we call her) is wonderful. Since I know she'll never read this I can confess I really love KW and dream of spending more time with her. I've tried to let her know how I feel but just end up saying the dumbest things when she's around. The night Max arrived I was nervous and actually suggested she could carry me like a little baby! What the hell was I thinking? I envy Bob and Terry when she carries them around. Why does she like her stoner friends more than me? Despite my attempts to get to know her better she seems disinterested in me. She very slightly resembles Carol but is much better looking, and also does not bring to mind any animal comparisons, with the exception of her water fowl feet. I think she's beautiful. KW often leaves the group (I mean tribe) for long stretches, something I think about doing but almost never do. Judith is the only other female. She can be a bit intense and won't hesitate to tell you what's on her mind. We have a special bond and I know she cares about me, even thought she often ignores or interrupts me as much as the others do. I've never known for certain what a mother is but for some reason there's something at my core that makes me want to have a mother, and Judith is the closest thing I'll probably ever know. One time when Max was talking with KW I overheard him telling her about his mother. I almost cried. Anyway, Judith is extremely outspoken and can also be a real downer sometimes. She looks fierce, certainly like what a Wild Thing should. Picture a rhino-inspired center horn along with two head horns and a large number of very sharp teeth. She does have beautiful long hair. I used to like Douglas well enough, until he nearly killed me with dirt clods the size of Connecticut. Dirt clods my furry ass, those things had rocks in them! Actually, I'm not angry about it anymore, not really. And he was just following orders. Avian clearly describes Douglas, but not in a good way. Think chicken rather than eagle. Still, he's level headed and a great builder of things. He's smart and I think he was the only one besides me to work out something was rotten in Denmark (I mean about Max). I've wanted to ask him just what he knew and when he knew it but never have. I only wish he wouldn't yield to Carol so much; but then again, look what happened the one time he did stand up to Carol. Many times I was tempted to take a stand but after what poor Douglas got it's unlikely I ever will. This goat is very fond of his appendages, and although I like sticks I don't want to adopt one as part of my anatomy. Something terrible happened to Douglas which I'll explain later. Let's just hope his arm really will grow back. We tell ourselves it will. Ira is…I don't know – in the background? For the most part he is kind and gentle, and he's a good influence on Judith. In fact, they've become very close. I can't fully explain it but I sometimes feel resentment toward Ira. Just like I've never known a mother I've also never known a father (where did I came from?), but I can't help feeling Ira is attempting to replace my non-existent father, which makes absolutely no sense. Ira tends to offer unsolicited advice which, while well intentioned, irritates me to no end. In some ways Ira is the most human looking in the group (sorry, tribe) and I can't think of any animal comparisons, other than perhaps a big-nosed bear with yak fur instead of bear fur. For some weird reason he is obsessed with making large holes in trees. I hate trees so he can put holes in all of them if he wants. Is it odd that I like sticks but don't like trees? I never thought about it until now. The Bull somehow lost track of his right name (I think it's Daniel), but then again the Bull suits him just fine. He certainly looks more like a bull than I do a goat, except for his goofy non-bull feet. It's funny how we can live around someone and yet know very little about them. I've only ever heard him speak about two dozen words and he keeps to himself more than KW, but without actually leaving the group (I mean tribe). Really, he's just part of the scenery most of the time. But he doesn't seem to care if we don't notice him. Maybe I should make an attempt to get to know him better. After all, he doesn't ignore me any more than he does the others, which is a good sign. He's shy and tends to groan quite a lot, probably more than he realizes. But I think he pays closer attention to things than we sometimes give him credit. I may as well mention that everyone is taller than me; two by a little and the other four by quite a lot. Thankfully my horns add height. At least when Max was around I was taller than someone for a change. Trust me, being the shortest gets old. I'm constantly having to look up at the others and can perfectly describe their nostril interiors in exquisite, nauseating detail. It's like I'm an ENT. If somewhere there is a truly evil handkerchief that commits murder or something and needs to go to handkerchief hell it can just be sent to Carol's nose. I'm not only the shortest in our group (I mean tribe) I'm also the smallest and certainly the thinnest. Seriously, you don't want to be at the bottom of a pile with them on top. As far as looks go it's not that the others are ugly or anything, but my rugged goat looks are hard to beat. I'm not vain, just truthful. It's my narrative and I'll damn well write what I want. It's not like any of the others will ever see this, and I'll keep it well hidden. I'd look a lot better if someone would lather me up from head to foot with Mane 'n Tail shampoo and then give me a good brushing. My fur could be as soft as Mohair. And my ear fur needs trimmed. That's probably too much information…let's move on.[Chapter 5] I think that's enough background. Now it's time to talk of cabbages and kings. That's an odd phrase, and I don't know what they have in common, other than both are edible. Ever had king slaw? That's a joke. Read on, I'll get to menu items a little later. Anyway, I want to write about the night we found our once and former king. Well, not really night but pre-dawn morning. We're nocturnal much of the time. And technically Max found us. Sorry, none of that even matters. It was the time Carol went off the rails even more spectacularly than usual. I mean it was the craziest I'd ever seen him…up till then. I still don't know what his major malfunction was but it started when KW suddenly left. I think they had an argument. The rest of us were also a little miffed by her wanting to spend more and more time with her new friends, Bob and Terry (we hadn't yet met her owl friends and I'll tell more about them later), but Carol really had a problem with it. So he very kindly decided to make everyone suffer. What a sport. Living on a remote island means no real creature comforts (in fact, it's as primitive as can be), but being a Wild Thing means you tough it out. We had built a few simple mud and stick huts which weren't going to end up on the cover of Better Huts and Gardens but which were reasonably comfortable. I liked my hut. We put a lot of work into them, and I know I gathered up about ten million sticks during the build. Did I mention I'm good at finding sticks? I probably shouldn't because it's really not much of a talent. There are tons of them just lying around and you'd have to be blind not to find them in the woods. I think I like sticks because they're parts of trees that have fallen off. Getting back to what I was saying; Carol was mad as hell and decided he wasn't going to take it anymore and the best way to work through his problems with KW was to smash the huts. I never really thought it was much of a plan, but I try to fit into the group (I mean tribe) whenever possible and hoped humoring him might somehow redirect his anger away from the huts. So against my better judgment I offered to help. Looking back I can see it was a bad idea. I don't like to admit it but I sometimes have trouble saying no, and this might have been a good time to have started. But then again, if I had tried to stop him I might now be missing a horn or have something like a large garden gnome inserted deep inside me. Who knows where Carol's faulty thinking might lead. At one point he very literally accepted my faint-hearted offer to help and hurled me against a hut. Have I mentioned Carol can be a jackass? Carol's tantrum was bad enough but the night was about to go from chaotic and stressful to full blown weird. Other animals can't normally sneak up on us very easily since most of us have excellent hearing and keen senses of smell, and I guess it happened because we were distracted by Mr. Jackass and his braying. I mean that guy should have someone named Balaam riding around on him, or be booked to open Hee Haw . Seriously. Without warning a strange little creature smashed through the back wall of a hut and into the center of the clearing! This of course was Max. Since I've already mentioned him a few times I sort of lost the opportunity to fully develop any drama at this point, but I can tell you it was pretty damn dramatic at the time. However, none of us could have imagined how different everything would be from that moment – including Max. Just as he destroyed that hut wall he would in many ways destroy our world, our perceptions and to some degree, our hearts. I don't mean he literally destroyed all these things. I'm just trying to be dramatic here since I screwed up the chance to do it earlier. But he did change everything. I want to take a moment to set the record straight about this event just in case you may have somehow heard an alternate version. I did not scream like a terrified schoolgirl as was suggested by one or more of the others present that night. I vigorously sounded the alarm with great purpose, and if it looked like I was shrieking in terror when Max suddenly appeared then all I can say is that in the confusion of the moment my actions were misinterpreted. At least that's how I remember it. Now let us never speak of it again. At this point we had no earthly idea what the thing was, where it came from and what it might do next. It walked on two legs, like us, instead of on four, but didn't really resemble anything I'd ever seen. Actually (and this is a strange thing to admit) for a second it almost reminded me of myself because of its size, slender build and light colored fur, but of course without horns (can you imagine not having horns? – freak show!). Anyway, it almost looked like a smaller version of me, but as I said without horns and with a longer tail. Wait, I didn't say anything about the tail. But now I have. By the way my tail is a little on the short side, like a goat's tail. I have no idea what a tail is for, but it does cover my…never mind. The thing's body was fury but the face part was smooth and pinkish, like my paw pads, and it didn't have any claws on its hands. It had small pointy ears, crooked black whiskers and strange little round things down its front. Honestly, my next impression was that it was a giant mouse or hamster. It ran around screaming and whacking things with a big stick before running into a hut and knocking itself down. For about half a minute everyone was dead quite. Then Carol walked up to the thing and it made a noise that almost sounded like \"hello\". Carol sniffed at the creature and it sniffed back. We all watched in silence as Carol and the thing looked each other over. I was relieved when it didn't shoot venom or a stink spray or anything. It's interesting to note Carol seemed drawn to it from the very beginning. Next he chuckled and told the thing he liked its demo work – and the thing clearly said \"thanks\". Now I wondered if it was a large talking mouse. I think a large talking mouse is about the very last thing I ever hope to see. That would be one icky mouse! There was at least one silver lining to the creature turning up; it had distracted Carol from destroying the huts and two or three (including mine) had survived. But knowing Carol I shouldn't have been surprised when the very next thing he did was challenge the creature to a hut smashing contest. Great, not only would the remaining huts also be destroyed it would be done by a weird talking rodent thing. So Carol ran in one direction and the creature – you know I'm just going to start calling him Max since I already mentioned his name about ten times already – then Max ran the other way and tried to smash The Bull's hut. When The Bull came out and groaned at him Max finally stopped acting crazy and stood still. Douglas started asking questions and got a little sharp with him, and Judith asked if he was Bob or Terry. Once Judith got involved I knew what the probable outcome for Max would be. We started circling which is when I think Max realized he wasn't in Kansas anymore. Everything really went south from there, thanks mostly to Judith. She never gave Max a chance to explain who he was and why he had come. Judith doesn't like to try to resolve conflicts and her default solution is basically to eat anything she'd rather not deal with. I think there's a time and place for at least trying diplomacy but Judith's idea of finding middle ground is to make sure anything she doesn't like or trust finds her middle ground – from the inside. I mean her stomach, in case that was sort of unclear. Again, it wouldn't be my recommendation to immediately ingest any new arrival without at least attempting introductions. But at the time I didn't have any reason to stop it and probably couldn't have even if I'd wanted to. Guess there was a little something like mob mentality at work. I know what you're thinking: \"don't tell me that you're innocent, because it insults my intelligence\". Hell, there may be some truth to that.[Chapter 6] Earlier I said anything having to do with eating was a thorny issue, and now you know why. Wild Things are near the top of the food chain on the island so we really don't think about what it's like to have someone eat you for just about any reason, or even no reason. I'm afraid we're a little to hasty to chow down first and ask questions later rather than attempt real problem solving. I mean, piss us off (especially Judith) and wham – down the hatch. Not so much me because remember I'm not as wild as the others, and anyway I prefer a good salad most of the time. But to tell the truth I've participated in a few eat-something-rather-than-deal-with-it incidents in the past. It's not something I'm proud of and I don't plan to do it again. I should check out EA or something. Really, we'd never eaten anything like Max. Well, there was this one hideous, semi-man looking thing a bit smaller than Max that kept talking about precious something or other. It was clearly evil and needed eating. It tasted a little middle-earthy. I remember a large, silly white rabbit that went on and on about kids stealing its tricks or some such nonsense (like young goats would even care about some crazy, wild hare). It did stay surprisingly crunchy in milk. Lets see, a crab with a phony accent that washed up on the beach and really irritated Judith by singing some awful song about living under the sea (we know you lived under the sea, you were a crab). What else…a large, pear-shaped purple lizard that was clearly in denial because it kept saying it loved us, and we loved it, right up until the end. Sure, Judith loved it but not the way it meant. I thought it tasted sickeningly sweet, like treacle. There was the lackadaisical bear with a serious honey habit and a little piglety thing that showed up with a depressed gray donkey. We let the donkey go, he was just too sad to eat, and we liked his dry sense of humor. Of course Carol could never have eaten the jackass – professional courtesy and all. Ira said the bear thing tasted a bit dungy so I'm glad I skipped it. That's about it…other than a couple hundred small marshmallowly blue things with white tops and bottoms which tasted like berries and never stopped screaming gibberish that sounded like variations of one word. Something about surfing. I guess they went out of season because I haven't seen any in a while. I've made my point; we'd never eaten anything like Max before. Possibly because we'd never seen anything like him, but I prefer to think in the end we would have realized he was too interesting to eat. But Max believed we planned to eat him which is what led to the start of all our problems. Poor Max, when I think about it from his perspective I can understand why he did what he did. I don't completely excuse it, but I understand it. Still, the joke around here is \"how can you tell when Max is lying? His lips are moving\". That's a little Wild Thing humor. Rather than go gently into that good night Max somehow summoned his wits, and in a more commanding voice than we ever expected cried out two words I'll never forget – \"be still!\" We all froze and I don't know who was more surprised, Max or us. Even Carol who hadn't joined our flanking maneuvers took notice and began to walk toward us. For whatever reason Max's tactic had worked to buy him time, and he used that time to decide how to survive. If only he'd been honest and told us he was just a boy, and appealed to our better nature. I know we would have spared him, and probably even looked after him. But his decision was to lie. And I don't mean little white lies like when I tell the others I don't think Carol is a jackass, I mean great whopping lies that grow and multiply until the truth is trampled into dust. But it's easy for me to say this when I wasn't standing where Max was. Really, I don't know what I would have done in his place. In a way we brought all this on ourselves by letting Max think we would eat him…and then not actually eating him. I mean, if we had carried through that would have been an end to it right then and there. Huh…well that ship has sailed. Judith asked why shouldn't we eat him, and I thought well that's it, he's a goner now for sure. Max hesitated, but only a moment. And then he told us about his powers from another land, from ancient times – and that he was prepared to show us. I didn't like the sound of that. Max talked about terrible giants called Vikings (the bastards wore horned hats and I don't want to think about how they got the horns) which he had single-handedly defeated while defending his ice fortress. He exploded their giant heads! Even we can't explode giant heads. I don't think we can explode regular size heads. How could we compete with power like that? Then came the thing that saved his bacon and really got Carol's attention; he used the \"k\" word – king. I still had my doubts but when Max told us he had a double re-cracker which could blast his power through anything in the universe I started to wonder if he might be telling the truth. It sounded plausible, and who would lie about having a double re-cracker? A regular single re-cracker, maybe, but a double? I mean you just don't expect any reasonable person to lie about something like that. Still, even a little doubt is enough, and I wanted to ask a few follow up questions but decided to wait and see what developed. Judith started to ask more questions and also seemed skeptical but Carol shut her down, and she actually kept quiet. Crazy king craving Carol coveted a king – and at last he was going to have a real one. Douglas asked Max if he could keep out all the sadness, and when Max said he had a sadness shield big enough for all of us and could also explode loneliness, we all heard what we wanted to. The tender seeds of belief had sprouted and would grow until plucked up, roots and all. That last part is figurative; Max didn't actually bring any seeds or plant anything. But that little voice in my mind still whispered maybe all this was BS, and despite the risk of crossing Carol I decided to say something. I said Max didn't look like a king, and if he could be king then maybe so could I. Not that I wanted to be king, or even thought we needed a king – I was just making a point. I'll never forget the look Max gave me when I said that. It started the two of us out on bad terms and Max would certainly remember my questioning his kingship, and even repay me a little. But Judith quickly shushed me. I never asked if she was just interrupting me out of habit or trying to protect me from Carol. It can be hard to know when Judith is being nice. Max really piled it on and told us he had been a king in his land for 20 years. At the time we didn't know he was just a boy. He was the first human we'd actually met, don't forget. The first live one, anyway. Were we naïve? Does a one legged duck swim in a circle? But in our defense it's not too difficult to deceive a bunch (I mean tribe) of Wild Things that live a simple life on an isolated island. At one point Max pushed back the fur from his head and the attached ears and whiskers with it. It really freaked me out but then I realized he didn't actually have fur but was wearing some sort of costume. I think it was supposed to be a dog or wolf. That should have given us another clue. I mean, how many kings run around in what looks like a homemade wolf suit? But hindsight is 20/20 and all. KW came back just then which seemed a good omen. Maybe Max did have powers and could pull off this king business. I shouted hello to her but as usual she didn't seem to notice me. She asked about Max and I stuck my foot in my mouth and said I'd tell her about the new king if we went for a walk, and that she could carry me like a baby. It was a feeble attempt at humor but ended up sounding awkward, not to mention a little creepy. If you've ever said something that came out wrong and then immediately regretted it than you know what I mean. Then she asked about a missing stick and instead of cutting my losses and keeping quiet I blurted out I was good at finding sticks and would help her look for it. I thought she was talking to me since she knows I'm good at finding sticks. We've established it's not terribly difficult but I am still the best at finding them. Anyway, KW was in time for the coronation of King Max I. Although I don't think we knew his name then; in fact, I can't think when he told us his name which is odd because I distinctly recall KW shouting \"look out, Max!\" when Carol nearly jumped on him later that morning during our wilding in the woods. Well it's not important and may be just a continuity error in my memory. We all just called him king much of the time. Carol and the Bull walked Max toward the fire pit as the rest of us stood together and watched. Ira seemed almost giddy with excitement and said Max was going to make us happy, and Judith answered with something that sounded odd, something like happiness wasn't always the best way to be happy. At the time it didn't make much sense to me…and frankly it still doesn't. I should ask her to explain. Then Judith seemed to read my mind and said Max was small for a king. I tried to remind them I had said the same thing not five minutes before, but Judith just told me to be quiet. No one ever wants to hear what I think. I swear, Mister Cellophane shoulda been my name. The Bull and Carol retrieved the scepter and crown from the fire and in doing so uncovered something that clearly gave Max an unpleasant surprise. I'm talking about the skeletons in the fire. Max nervously asked if the bones were prior kings and for one long moment all seven of us collectively held our breath. Carol's eyes darted back and forth as he stammered out the lamest explanation imaginable. He told Max the bones were there before we arrived and he didn't know anything about them – and then immediately contradicted himself by adding he had never seen them before! It was so bogus I rolled my eyes until they hurt. I watched Max, just waiting for him to run like hell since it was obvious Carol was lying about the bones, but to my surprise he seemed to buy Carol's feeble explanation. Carol, crown in hand, asked if he was OK and Max actually smiled and said he was. I guess that stupid pointy crown went to his head. Up till then he seemed fairly bright but now I wondered if he suffered from Clue Deficit Disorder. I shrugged and thought how gullible Max was, which of course in hindsight is unbelievably ironic considering the bill of goods he had just sold all of us. So apparently we can all have CDD now and then. Wait, I need to review my prior writing for a second. Damn, I need to explain about the bones! Keeping things organized while writing is harder than I expected. I wish Dave was here to give me a few pointers. Now I have to do a flash back thingy.[Chapter 7] I like to take long hikes in the mountains on the far side of the island, and one day about six months before Max arrived I lost my way and ended up in an area I'd never been to before. Long story short, I found a small hidden valley and decided to explore. While looking around something shiny caught my eye, so I took a closer look and found a strange object partially covered by vines. What I saw scared me a little so I didn't want to get too near the thing. Later I ran into Douglas and told him about the strange thing in the valley and the next day we decided to investigate. We returned to the valley, and after clearing away the vegetation found the strangest object we'd ever seen. It was made of some kind of metal and had a few openings in the sides. The main part was hollow and looked something like an elongated hut. It had a large flat fin or wing-like thing attached to one side, and on one end was a pointy thing with two smaller arms which were bent in a strange way, like it must have been moving in a circle and hit something. It looked very old, like it had been there for a long time. We knew the thing was some sort of flying machine, and after looking at it for a few seconds both said almost simultaneously \"air plane\". Good old mysterious knowledge for the save. Then I pointed and shouted \"ze plane! ze plane!\" and we laughed – I have no idea in the hell why. We peeked inside and saw something that made us jump. Bones! In fact, many bones, some of which were still connected to each other. It was a skeleton. No, two skeletons! And not like any animal skeletons we'd seen. The head bones were rounded and without horns. The teeth were small and fairly smooth. Clearly these things had walked upright on two legs like us. On the hands where the claws should have been were a cluster of small but complicated looking bones. Of course I now know what these poor things were, but at the time we had no idea, only that these dead beings had made the flying thing and crashed it on the island long ago. As we studied the bones I couldn't help but think what Carol would say when we told him. It was kind of funny how all this time he'd been waiting for mystical beings to appear and when it finally happens, they're dead! Suddenly an idea came to mind. Why not use these bones to stop Carol talking about finding a king? Wait, now I have to tell about something that happened before the part I'm writing about now. A flash back within a flash back – is that even allowed? We had tried different forms of self-governance but everything attempted was a dismal failure. You might not understand unless you live in a place with an out-of-control government made up of belligerent, backbiting Wild Things that spend all their time and energy jockeying for power in order to advance their own special interests at the expense of everyone else. For the most part all of us agreed Carol should just take over leadership (I wasn't thrilled about it but he is the strongest), but he never really tried very hard. Then he decided the only solution was to find someone else to be king, someone powerful, wise and outside the group (damn it, tribe) that could save us from ourselves. We thought it was just a phase he was going through but he was like a dog with a bone. It was king this and king that until we were all sick and tired of hearing about it. Only Carol seemed not to realize that no magical king was going to miraculously appear and agree to rule over a pack (sonuvabitch! TRIBE!) of squabbling, unruly Wild Things with a history of eating anything that even hinted at conflict. We were all weary of him harping about a king, and when Carol wasn't around talked about ways of making him deal with our problems now, on our own, with him as leader. But no viable solution even came to light and there didn't seem to be a way we could convince Carol to take his leadership role more seriously, at least nothing all six of us could agree on. Now I'm returning to the first flash back. I told Douglas we should take the skeletons with us because I had an idea that might just get Carol to shut up about the whole king thing. At first he didn't want to go along with it (he is Carol's best friend), but in the end he agreed. I think his motives were purer than mine, and he only wanted to make Carol take his leadership role more seriously. I have to admit my motives were at least a little ulterior; the thousand injuries of Carol I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon ignoring me all the damn time, and so on. Anyway, for whatever reason Douglas agreed to try my plan. The bones had flat ropes holding them in place and since Douglas couldn't fit through the openings in the side of the plane he said I had to go in and loosen the ropes. I didn't want to and suggested we find Richard or another raccoon to help but Douglas called me a chicken, and being called chicken by someone that looks like a big chicken is just something you can't back down from. It was creepy but I managed to get inside and loosen the flat ropes. I found a few large sticks and made a stretcher to hold the bones and we carried them to our side of the island and hid them near the huts. Luckily Carol was at his sanctum sanctorum, playing with his toy city or whatever, and didn't see us. I should have explained Carol often spends time away from the tribe (ha!) in his private studio place a few miles from the huts (sort of hypocritical of him to complain when KW went away for a few days). Anyway, whenever he was away for a day or two the first thing out of his mouth when he saw us again was how we needed a king. I swear it made me think about head-butting him in the gut with my horns. Not that I ever would, he could snap me like a twig. I'm stronger than I look but am no match for Carol. Getting back to the plan; Douglas and I knew we had to take the others into our confidence which was problematic because we didn't know if they would go along with it. And if they did want to, I wasn't certain they could all keep the secret. I don't know why conspiracy theories are so popular because really, a conspiracy with more than two or three conspirators is almost always doomed to fail. But it had to be all or none for this plan to succeed. We approached KW first and she readily agreed to join. She said it was time the rest of us tried to do something as a team and thought it would be a good joke, if nothing else. Also, I think she was a bit irritated with Carol at the time. I told the plan to Judith and at first she just put her hands on her hips and scowled at me with that what-the-hell-are-you-talking-about-Alexander look that she does so well. Then she smiled and said she was in. Of course she went on to say it probably wouldn't work, would be a disaster and that we might all end up maimed or dead, but she would give it a go. She can be a downer. Once Judith agreed Ira came onboard without a word. That nose ring is well and truly in place. I told the plan to the Bull but it probably wouldn't have made any difference if I hadn't. He just silently went along with us and never commented or asked any questions. Like I said, part of the scenery. Later we all got together and went over the plan in more detail. We all agreed it was a long shot but still thought it worth a try if it might stop Carol droning on about a king and step up to the plate as leader. And if it failed…well, I for one would be moving to the far side of the island for the foreseeable future. If Carol found out I had masterminded the plan I might just get to find out if my horns are hollow. Or worse. Alexander's Great Caper was mission ready! That's clever you see because \"caper\" is Latin for goat, and I worked in \"great\" plus a military reference. To suggest I'm like Alexander the Great because he was a good strategist. Of course he wasn't Roman so it doesn't completely work. No? Nothing? Crickets chirping…and there goes tumbleweed. OK, moving on.[Chapter 8] Just before sunrise we cleaned and polished the bones to make them white again, then sprinkled on a little blood and gore like they had just been killed and…you know. Yes, it's gruesome, and the poor weird creature Douglas found and…um…harvested for the…material certainly didn't like the plan. It was green, very foul tempered and washed up in a round metal container. Good timing for us, bad for it. But I swear to God, we didn't eat it! Partly because it smelled funny. Anyway, we prepped the bones and put them near the fire pit with the crown and scepter. Judith and Ira went off on their own (which they often do to make goo-goo eyes at each other), and the Bull left for his usual mud bath in the ravine. This would leave the hut area seemingly deserted and ensure Carol would be the one to find the bones. Douglas, KW and I waited until we saw Carol coming down the hill from his studio and then hid behind one of the huts. At first Carol went to his hut for a while but soon came out into the clearing and looked around. I guess he wondered why the place was deserted since at least a few of us were usually at the huts, especially in the morning. Carol yawned, scratched himself a few times, then finally looked toward the fire pit – and froze. He stood there not moving a muscle for at least half a minute, his mouth open and his eyes big and round. I had to almost cram my fist into my mouth to keep from laughing. It was the first time I ever saw Carol shocked and it was so satisfying. KW looked at me with an expression I didn't quite understand. But I couldn't ask her what she was thinking because Carol might overhear. Carol composed himself and very slowly walked toward the skeletons. He sniffed them and then hesitantly picked up the crown. He turned it over in his hands a few times, just staring at it in disbelief, then dropped it and sat down – almost fell, really – onto one of the big logs near the fire pit. It was priceless! Now it was time for Douglas to open our little drama. He walked toward Carol, sort of whistling nonchalantly, and when Carol quickly stood up Douglas pretended to be startled, as if he hadn't seen Carol and didn't expect him to be there. Then Douglas started his performance in earnest, and I must say he didn't lay an egg. He was very convincing. Douglas quickly stammered something like \"Carol, what…why are you back so early? I…I didn't expect you for a while! I thought I had…time...to…\" and just sort of trailed off in mid-sentence. It was great! That bird is finger lickin' good. I mean about his acting – what did you think I meant? Carol of course wanted to know about the bones and Douglas sort of looked at the ground and ran his hand over his head feathers, but didn't say anything. Carol was visibly shaken and I didn't like the look in his eyes. He can loose control at the drop of a hat, and even though Douglas is his best friend I started to worry what Carol might do. Time for Alexander to enter, stage right. I swallowed hard, flashed the crossed claws \"good luck\" sign to KW, slipped silently from behind the hut and stealthily skirted around the perimeter to enter just behind the fire pit. At this point I started to think maybe the plan wasn't such a great idea, but it was too late now. The curtain was up and I had to go on. Besides, I couldn't leave Douglas twisting in the wind. I approached at an angle that deliberately kept Carol behind a tree and out of my line of sight but allowed me to see Douglas, and him to see me. As I got closer I said in a loud, frantic whisper \"Douglas, come on, we've got to clean everything up before Carol…\" and then stopped suddenly and sucked in my breath real hard when I saw Carol step around the tree. I even took a few steps back and put my hands to my mouth like I was stunned and afraid to see him there. To tell the truth, it wasn't all acting. Carol was now fully wound up and shouting at both of us. He demanded to know what in the hell was going on and implied that Douglas and I might seriously regret what could happen next if we didn't start explaining. Up till that time Carol had made threats but never actually resorted to physical violence, but it was frightening nonetheless. I put my hands up, and in my best timid, cringing voice said \"Carol, please…please calm down! We're sorry! It just happened b-before we knew what we were doing! We're so sorry!\" I hammed it up quite nicely. Douglas said \"Alexander, be quite!\" which was very realistic since he and the others say that to me all the time. \"Let me handle this\" he added. Then Judith and Ira wandered in and both did a decent job of seeming shocked and surprised to see Carol so angry and shouting at Douglas and me. Douglas looked at Carol for several seconds, sighed, and then shook his head like he just couldn't bring himself to speak. Judith fidgeted and said she and Ira had only stopped by to get something from her hut and they both turned to leave, but Carol snorted and then growled a little which stopped them in their tracks. Then I realized KW hadn't yet joined us. While going over the plan we had decided Douglas would take the lead but that all of us would straggle in once he had started talking to Carol. I looked toward the hut where I supposed she must still be hiding but didn't see her. At last Douglas started talking. I don't recall word for word what Douglas said but he started by reminding everyone that Carol had spent the night at his studio. He then set the stage for the rest of the story by telling Carol that while we was away something very unusual had happened to the rest of us at the hut compound. The story was this: while the six of us were sitting around the fire talking about how much we admired Carol and wishing he would take his leadership role more seriously, a bright light flashed overhead and something that sounded like a million buzzing bees descended from the moonless sky. A vertical shaft of blue light appeared in the clearing and from it emerged two of the strangest beings any of us had ever seen. One was about my height, the other a bit shorter, and they stood upright like us. The taller one was covered with gold and silver fur. On its hornless head was a crown and in its clawless hand it help a scepter. It was frightening but regal in appearance. The other alien closely resembled the first but had less impressive looking fur and no crown or scepter. It seemed to be an attendant or something. Now, had strange beings like these actually appeared in the middle of a dark night I'm fairly certain we wouldn't have all just stood around calmly looking at them; at least I know I wouldn't have. I think you would have seen six Wild Thing-shaped blurs disappear into the night. Luckily Carol didn't question our make-believe bravery and seemed utterly transfixed by Douglas' tale. Our fictional alien beings glided toward us and the one with the crown said \"behold, I am your king, come to reign over you. Take me to the one called Carol for I must challenge him in mortal combat for control of this kingdom.\" Douglas did an excellent job rendering the being's otherworldly voice and I could see Carol was buying the story, unbelievable as it was. At one point I had to pretend to cough to keep from laughing. Douglas paused and looked away like he just couldn't tell what happened next, and the rest of us also looked away or down at the ground. I tugged nervously at my beard and tried to look guilty. Douglas ran his hand back and forth over his head feathers. Judith sort of kicked at the ground in a fidgety way, and Ira put his hands up to his eyes like he was trying hard not to remember something. The Bull had silently joined us and now stood at a distance, groaning in a way that sounded almost remorseful. Only KW was missing and I was getting nervous. Where was she? Carol looked at each of us, read our body language and then gasped. His eyes widened and he looked toward the bones. \"What did you do? What did you do ?\" he finally stammered. He tried to look each of us in the face but seemed unable to take his eyes away from the skeletons which now glistened in the early morning sun. Finally I saw KW approaching from behind the hut. Carol quickly turned as he heard the steps and looked at her with a nervous, pleading look. She met his gaze for a moment, cleared her throat as if to speak but said nothing. She slowly walked past Carol without looking at him again and joined the rest of us standing opposite. At last Douglas resumed the story. He said that after regaining his composure he had taken a few steps toward the alien and demanded to know why it thought it had the right to be our king and challenge Carol to a fight. Douglas added that Ira, Judith and KW had also advanced while asking questions, as did I a moment later while keeping my distance. I didn't appreciate Douglas adding that little detail because it made me sound like I was afraid. But to be honest it's probably what I would have done if actually in that situation because I'm smaller than the others and often guard the rear. I'm not a coward, just very practical, and keeping Judith between me and any danger just makes good sense. Call it goat sense. Carol listened with rapt attention and seemed not to doubt any part of the story so far. Douglas continued and said the alien king narrowed its evil, reptilian eyes, scowled and pointed the scepter at us, shouting something like \"how dare you question your king? Bow before me or I will exact a terrible penalty! As for the one you call Carol, I will destroy him so that I may reign over you lesser creatures without fear of reprisal\". Douglas paused while we all looked at Carol. I saw only astonishment in his eyes. I could just imagine what was going through his mind; he had wanted a king and against all odds one had arrived – but not the benevolent, gracious king he had supposed but an arrogant tyrant willing to destroy the very Wild Thing that had longed for a king in the first place. That is, if Carol was buying the fantastic story now unfolding, and by all appearances he was. I should mention that as Douglas told the story Judith, Ira and I made little noises and one-word declarations of confirmation which seemed to convince Carol he was hearing the truth. But much of the credit goes to Douglas. Really, he did a far better job of it than I might have expected. In fact, all of us did a pretty good job in the drama department. Only KW remained silent. Otherwise it was a flawless opening night for The Wild Thing Community Theatre. Douglas, having paused for effect, resumed the story. In a voice filled with energy and emotion he said that when the would-be king dared to threaten Carol all of us reacted in an instant. We roared our terrible roars, gnashed our terrible teeth, rolled our terrible eyes and showed our terrible claws (Douglas was in fine form now), and fell en masse upon the aliens and tore them to pieces! Then he sort of suggested that some frenzied…um…banqueting might have gone on. By the way, our roars, teeth, eyes and claws really aren't that terrible; especially mine. But then again I suppose we would look pretty fierce to humans. Humans don't have much in the way of roars, teeth, eyes or claws, so I suppose in comparison to them the name Wild Thing applies to us at least a little. Thanks to the mysterious knowledge a strange little drawing popped into my mind. Two fat alligators are sunning along a river bank next to a broken boat and bits of torn cloth and other debris. The one alligator says to the other \"that was incredible! No fur, no claws, no horns, no scales…just soft and pink!\" Disturbing but true, because if all humans are like Max I imagine they run the risk of being eaten all the time since they're like little hors d'oeuvres with no way to defend themselves. You can just stop yelling \"digression\" because like I said before, I can't hear you.[Chapter 9] Douglas paused to give Carol time to process what he had just heard. Carol looked at each of us in turn, then at the bones, and I saw something that looked like tears at the corners of his eyes. He was buying this! And he was moved to think we selflessly fell upon alien beings with potentially awesome powers – one of them a frigging king no less – and possibly at great risk to ourselves, in order to protect him. My plan no longer seemed so outrageous. Carol sniffed a couple of times, then sighed and shook his head softly. He asked why we hadn't come to tell him what had happened, and why we wanted to hide the evidence and keep the whole thing a secret. Douglas hesitated for a moment and to my surprise Ira jumped in and said we were afraid to tell him because we knew how badly he wanted a king. Judith said this alien looked to be a real bastard and had threatened to kill Carol, but even so once we regained our composure we worried about how angry Carol would be at our having dispatched a possible king, since he had been wanting one so badly. Each of us then made little agreeing statements along this line, but always adding that we did what we did on instinct, and to protect Carol. All but KW; she still hadn't spoken a word. I was puzzled why. Douglas put his hand on Carol's shoulder and said that he accepted full responsibility for what had happened. This display of selfless sincerity was the icing on the cake and Carol visibly relaxed. He sniffed, wiped his eyes with a quick motion as if hoping we wouldn't notice, and actually tried to smile a little. Clearly he was touched to think his family cared about him so much. I actually felt a little guilty. But who knows – maybe we would have done something like that for him if the opportunity actually arose. Carol looked at the bones again and said he couldn't believe we had sacrificed a king just to protect him. Douglas quickly said we wanted nothing to do with a king who made threats against any of us, and that as far as we were concerned Carol was the only leader we needed. I looked up at Carol with what I hoped was an admiring expression and added that as long as he was there to lead us we would be just fine (now that was acting). Ira and Judith murmured their agreement and the Bull groaned something that sounded like affirmation. At last KW spoke. \"It's true\" she said in a barely audible tone. For a while nobody said anything. I don't know why but at that moment I felt closer to the others than I had in a long time. And I was seeing a side to Carol I never knew existed. A vulnerability he had always kept hidden, or which perhaps even he never knew existed. I was having mixed emotions about the plan, and sensed KW was as well. But we must all hang together, so to speak. And not just at that time, but forever. I hoped KW hadn't had a change of heart but my goaty sense was tingling, and I feared she had. Carol sighed and took a few steps toward the fire pit. After looking at the bones one last time he kicked them into the fire, then picked up the crown and scepter and tossed them in after. He turned and looked at us with a sad but understanding expression. He said that while he wished none of this had happened, what was done was done, and he couldn't fault us for our actions. He got a little choked up before quickly regaining his composure, then added had he not been away when the alien king appeared he would have accepted its challenge and fought to the death because we deserved a leader that was willing to fight for us, no matter the risk. All of us moved toward him, talking at once and saying we were sorry about what happened, that we knew he would have done all he could to protect us, and that we never wanted a king anyway. Carol thanked us but said we still needed a king, and for a moment I thought the plan had failed. Could he really still hope for a king after all this? Carol said we would recognize our true king when he appeared. I sighed. The plan had failed. But then he said he would try to be a better leader because we had no way of knowing how long it might be until a true king arrived, and that until it happened he wouldn't talk about it anymore. The plan had worked! I tried not to smile. I glanced at KW and was surprised to see how sad she looked. I also felt a pang of regret but it quickly passed as I thought about all the times Carol snapped at me or made me feel overlooked and forgotten. Besides, what harm had we done? As long as Carol never found out it would be OK. Even if he did find out we could possibly pass it all off as an elaborate prank. Carol mustered a weak smile and said he needed to be alone for a while to think. Douglas nodded and, stepping forward, patted Carol on his upper arm. Carol leaned in and gave Douglas a quick half hug, and they slapped each other on the back a few times. KW put her hand on his shoulder and tried to smile. She and Carol looked into each other's eyes for several seconds and then shared a long embrace. When they separated KW quickly turned away and I could see she was trying hard not to cry. Ira extended his hand and Carol took it in both of his, patting it a few times. Judith started to put her hand on his shoulder but then stooped, but Carol touched her arm and they quickly hugged, after which she pretended to punch him in the jaw. Each managed a weak smile. Then Carol turned to me. I mustered all my courage and looked him in the eye, hoping that nothing in my face would betray me. He gently grabbed my horns and playfully waggled my head back and forth a few times before putting his hand on my shoulder for just a moment. Et tu, Alexander , I thought to myself. He turned and started toward his hut and the Bull stretched out his arm. They brushed claw tips as Carol walked by. The six of us watched him walk to his hut. Once he was out of sight we turned toward one another and stood silently together, each no doubt wondering what the others were thinking. No one spoke but all instinctively knew we would never talk about the events of that morning again. For a few long minutes we remained standing together in the glaring angular rays of the rising sun, the lengthening shadows of nearby trees falling between us. Flies buzzed around the fire pit. My heart grew sick; it was the sight of the bones that made it so. One by one the others turned and walked away without a word, leaving me alone with my victory. My hollow little victory. Hollow as a goat's horn.[Chapter 10] Sorry about the flash backs – I promise never to do it again. But like Lucy chided Ricky \"he had some 'splaining to do\". I mean about the bones of course. Yeah, I may be a Wild Thing but I'm not a monster, and that goes for the others as well – even Carol. By the way, after starting to make more paper the thought of handwriting the rest of the story made my poor claws twitch. I knew there must be a better option, and it took some time but I managed to build a writing machine! I'm very pleased with it. I was right about using sticks from the apple trees and they worked great for building the machine. Think I'll call it an Apple. But then I had to figure out a system to run on the machine and do the actual writing, and it turned out willow sticks worked best because they're very small, slender and pliable. I call it Microsoft Wood. I'm all set now – no more stick pens and writer's cramp. I just have to pay a few squirrels to keep running on the wheel that powers the machine. They work for nuts so it's fairly easy to do. If I run out of nuts I'll just threaten to eat them. I won't of course, I'm trying to reform – but they don't know it. But about the plan…I can't help thinking I forgot to mention something. Oh well, must not be very important if I can't think of it. Never mind. Before I flashed back we were about to crown Max king. I was a bit perplexed he wanted to go ahead with it after Carol's feeble explanation of the bones. But I guess many of us try to ignore disturbing things we don't fully understand in the hope that blind optimism will carry the day and all's well that ends well. That's why I'm not much of an optimist. I'm not actually a pessimist or anything; call me a realist. So here we are, at the coronation, not long after Max arrived. Carol gently lowered the crown onto Max's head and said \"you are the king, and you will be a truly great king\". I certainly hoped it was true but a sliver of doubt stuck in my mind like those prickly little burrs stick in my fur when I walk in tall grass. As I watched the coronation the words \"uneasy lies the head that wears a crown\" popped into my mind. If Max only knew! If any of us could have known! As it turned out the phrase should have been \"uneasy the lying head that wears a crown\". I've forgiven Max, but as you may have noticed I'm still a bit hurt when I think about the lies he told us. No doubt it will pass with time. I was starting to warm to the idea of King Max and allowed myself to get caught up in the excitement of the moment. Besides, the others were keen to have a king and I didn't want to be a stick in the mud. Remember I said I try not to go against the grain. I have an independent mind but that doesn't mean I don't want to belong and all. Still, given that only six or so months earlier I had fabricated the story about a king suddenly turning up it's at least a little odd the six of us accepted Max's story without asking more questions. But Carol had taken the lead and it was easier to just follow along. Have you ever looked back at something that seemed to make sense at the time and kicked yourself for not seeing how things really were? Well, there you are. The Bull picked up Max by the scruff of his wolf suit and nearly brained him on a tree before setting him down on a ruined hut. It wasn't very dignified, but it was funny. Max seemed to take it in stride and didn't swear or anything. Hell, I would have. I like to swear just a little because it helps me cope with the frustration of being ignored all the damn time. See, it just creeps in. I guess it becomes habit. The others started hooting and hollering their satisfaction and chanting \"king\" but I didn't join them. Now that I think of it, neither did KW. Yeah, I was cautiously hopeful but still not ready to start cheering. Carol asked Max what his first order of business would be and I expected him to say he planned to set up court or maybe convene a committee to begin formulating a few laws and regulations. You know, something practical like that. But instead he paused for dramatic effect, raised the scepter above his head and shouted \"let the wild rumpus begin\". Wait…no, he said \"let the wild rumpus start\". That's strange, it seems like he should have said \"begin\" instead of \"start\". Never mind, it's not important. Sure we had had rumpuses before, many times. But never by royal decree, and the others went wild. It's not how I would have started my reign if crowned king, but I suppose there are worse things a new king might command. At least he didn't order us to build a gigantic white elephant of a fort or separate into warring factions and try to kill each other with dirt clods. That's called foreshadowing. And really, the fort was OK. In fact I actually came to love the fort. I wasn't so wild about the war thing. Now that's probably too much foreshadowing, and I'm getting my tenses mixed up. Forget about that stuff for now. Anyway, you don't have to tell us twice to rumpus and Max kicked it off by leaping onto Carol's head and then bouncing onto Ira. I'll skip the details of the next several minutes of frantic rumpusing, but looking back I'm reminded of what a famous critic once wrote when reviewing a certain comedy team: \"The Marx Brothers and their various relatives ran around the stage for 20 minutes; why, I have no idea.\" It was pretty much like that. All that was missing was a soundtrack featuring \"Rump Shaker\" by Wreckx-N-Effect. I'm not saying it wasn't fun to watch, but I didn't join in much. KW also stood by and only watched. I guess she and I just aren't so quick to jump into what the others are doing. Soon the sky showed the first faint light of day and Max ran off into the woods and called for us to follow. It felt good to run flat out through the trees, my heart pounding and lungs filling with the cool morning air. Everyone was whooping and laughing, and at one point we made circles around a large tree and raked it with our claws sending showers of bark and splinters everywhere. Take that you stupid tree! Hey, I wonder if that's what tree hugging means? Max led the way toward the cliffs overlooking the sea, with Carol and Ira right behind him. The rest of us joined them, and everyone began howling into the rising sun. Now I was fully caught up in the euphoria of the moment and howled and yowled every bit as much as the others. \"I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength.\" Even Max managed a few respectable howls, for a non-Wild Thing. In keeping with his costume he sounded a bit wolfy. Looking back, I have mixed feelings of contentment and loss when remembering that morning. How wonderful to have stood at the very edge of our world, howling at first light with my kin and king, the sea-salted air blowing through my fur. At the time I felt so alive and full of promise, as if some shining new epoch had arrived with Max and the dawn. If only that moment could have lasted forever. \"For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: 'It might have been!\" Tell me about it.[Chapter 11] The satisfied howling continued for several minutes. Suddenly Carol stopped howling and bounded away, calling for Max to follow him. Leave it to Carol to spoil the moment. Gradually we all stopped howling and I saw Max running after Carol, and soon both disappeared into the woods. I decided to follow. As I caught up I saw Carol showboating to Max by jumping high into the air. OK Carol, so you can jump. Good for you. Sadly, I can't. White goat-like Wild Things can't jump. But Carol's attempt backfired and he smashed his head into a tree branch which sent him careening to the ground with the branch on top of him. Good for you, tree. Carol got up and tried to make a joke out of it. I was a little irritated with him for ruining the moment at the cliff, and with Max for so quickly abandoning the rest of us to run after Carol. I know it was a bit kiddish but as I walked by I made a snarky remark along the lines of \"look, everyone wants to be friends with the new guy\" to let them both know what I thought. Of course when I said \"everyone\" I really meant myself since I wanted Max to be my friend too. Then to my horror I realized I had a small tree branch stuck on my head. How frigging embarrassing. Judith, Ira and Douglas were all abusing trees so I decided to show Max that I could do the same. I shouted for everyone to watch and then ran as fast as I could toward one of the larger trees. I think I shouted \"I hate this tree\" to psyche myself up or something. For some reason I assumed I could knock it down or at least make a large hole in it like Ira and Douglas do. Well I was wrong. Despite my sturdy horns and best effort I just bounced off the tree and crumpled to the ground. Now I know what seeing stars means. If only I had picked a sapling. Well so much for impressing Max. And now you know why I hate trees and all. While on the ground recovering I saw Max and Carol talking with Douglas. Then Carol threw Douglas high into the air (more shameless showboating) and as Carol walked away from Max Ira stepped up behind. He introduced himself to the king and they shook hands. I stood up, shook my head to clear away the stars and called Judith hoping she would check me over and make sure I was OK and not spurting blood out my ears or any other orifice. When she didn't come I started walking toward Max and Ira. Now I saw the best thing to do was just walk right up to Max, give him my best smile, put out my hand and introduce myself like Ira had done. Judith got there before me and Ira introduced her to Max. Even better, I thought, I'll have Ira introduce me which would seem more casual and keep me from looking too eager or needy. I peaked around Ira and suggested he might introduce me to the king, but he and Judith just ignored me. So did Max. What a surprise! Alexander ignored! But really, it makes sense. After all, a largish goat-like creature with big curved horns and white fur shinning in the sun is so hard to see. I felt my face getting warm, and it wasn't the sun. Douglas and his cat Timber decided to play \"timber\" (a game in which the object is to knock over a tree and crush anyone nearby; look for the exciting home edition), and they nearly got Max and Ira. At the time I wouldn't have minded seeing Max squashed like a bug, but now I feel a little bad for having thought that. After a little while Max decided to jump KW which got my attention, because KW doesn't like that sort of thing. I wondered if she might bite his head off or something. Perhaps Max's reign would be shorter than anyone expected. But surprisingly KW laughed and didn't commit regicide or anything, and again I wondered if Max might actually have special powers after all. Carol was so amazed to see KW laughing and roughhousing with Max that he leaped on them and in his haste nearly squashed Max, but KW yanked him out of the way just in time. Well I knew where this was headed. Yep, real pile time. We hadn't had a real pile in ages. Ira or Douglas leapt next, can't remember and not important anyway, and since I can't leap like the others Judith picked me up and hurled me onto the pile. I had to laugh despite my prior irritation because I love being thrown by her and flying through the air and all. Of course that sudden stopping part at the end isn't as fun. Judith leapt after throwing me, and the Bull sort of flopped on top. It was a real pile, no doubt about it. We had been awake all night and now began to feel very sleepy in the comfort and warmth of the pile. I could hear KW and Max talking but couldn't make out everything they said. I heard Max asking questions but KW shifted the conversation back to him and got him talking about where he came from. I only heard some of it and what I did hear didn't make much sense; something about frozen corn, and Max having no plans to eat anyone. Like he could eat us! But if he really did have special powers, perhaps he could. Naw, he was far too small for that, unless the double re-cracker had some sort of food processor function. I heard several of the others yawn and knew they were also tired and ready for sleep. Carol wished KW goodnight and each of us said our goodnights in turn. Thankfully no one said \"goodnight John Boy\" because I hate that joke like hell! I kept waiting for someone to wish Max goodnight, but nobody did. At first I thought well I'm not going to say goodnight to him, but then I relented. No point in making him feel left out, and I hoped to get on the right track with him later. I said \"goodnight king\" and the others realized the oversight and added their own \"goodnight king\" as well. It was good to be in a pile again, and despite all the excitement of having a new king my eyes grew heavy and I had to close them. Soon I drifted off to sleep and dreamed all manner of strange dreams. But none were as strange as the reality of the preceding few hours – or of the things to come. No, not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the things to come![Chapter 12] I don't know how long we slept, but when I awoke the sun was high overhead. For a split second I wasn't sure why I had been sleeping in the woods rather than my hut, but in an instant everything came back to me. Max's arrival and all the craziness that followed had gotten mixed up with my dreams, and for just a moment I wasn't sure what was real and what had been in my dreams. But reality soon pushed and shoved its way to the front, as it always does. I yawned, carefully rubbed my eyes (given my claws I always think of that stupid Captain Hook joke) and tried to recall the details of the dream. But as so often the case the particulars fled like chaff before the wind, and what had made sense in dream form now seemed vague and incoherent. There had been a strange, cold place with a rectangular building that looked like a giant hut but with smooth walls, lots of color and a bunch of bizarre looking objects all around. Later in the dream I heard a woman's voice frantically calling Max's name and felt panicked and afraid as I listened. Then a small sailboat tossing on an endless ocean was coming toward the island, and another voice said something like \"sleeper, awake\". And then I woke up. Most of the dream had already faded away but I knew parts of it had been ominous, like something terrible might happen. I tried to put it all out of my mind, and in the warm light of midday I easily shook it off, and in no time it all seemed irrelevant and even a bit silly. As I got up I saw Max and KW were still asleep, curled up next to each other with Carol next to them but awake. Ira and Judith had already left the pile and were talking together in hushed tones, I guess so as not to wake Max. Douglas and the Bull were nowhere in sight. Carol saw me get up and put his claw to his lips signaling me to keep quiet. I stretched and walked over to where Judith and Ira were sitting but they took no notice of me. After a few minutes I realized KW was now awake and saw Carol whisper something to her. She nodded and Carol very gently lifted Max and cradled him against his shoulder. With Max still asleep Carol started walking toward the interior of the island. The king was certainly a heavy sleeper, unless we had crushed him to death as we slept. To my relief I saw him move his hand a little. I asked Judith and Ira where Carol was going with Max but they ignored me. I asked again but Judith only shrugged and turned back toward Ira. I started to follow Carol but KW called my name so I turned back toward her. She told me Carol wanted time alone with the new king, to give him a tour of the island, and said I shouldn't follow. I asked why I couldn't go with them but she just made a face that seemed to say \"you know Carol\". Great, now Carol was going to keep Max all to himself and I would never have a chance to make friends with the king. KW must have seen the disappointment in my face because she got up and put her hand on my upper arm and gave it a gentle squeeze. Of course I felt better right away. She suggested we go to the beach which was thoughtful of her because she knows I love rolling in the warm sand. In fact we all enjoy doing it and the sand helps clean our fur and all. Judith and Ira said they'd join us and as we walked by the ruined huts we saw Douglas and the Bull there surveying the damage. We told them where we were headed and they decided to come along, and soon all six of us were headed toward our favorite strip of beach. After a few hours Douglas whistled to get our attention (he can do any bird call; you should hear his spotted whistling duck impersonation) and pointed toward one of the dunes. Max was kneeling in the sand making marks with his scepter as Carol looked on. We followed Douglas and as we got within earshot I heard Carol say something about not eating his feet off. I had no idea what in the world he was talking about but Douglas just asked why, as if he understood, and Carol said Max had decided we would build a fortress. So it looked like the king was finally starting to put some grand plans into action. Max had drawn a crude sketch of the fort in the sand and was excitedly describing everything he planned to build. I have to be honest, much of it sounded ridiculous and I started to seriously question his knowledge of basic architectural design and construction. I mean, it sounded like something a kid would come up with, not a king that had reined for 20 years. One thing he wanted to build was a swimming pool. Really? A pool? We were standing next to the ocean and he was talking about building a pool. Coals to Newcastle. I won't even mention some of the other things Max suggested, and most of them went right out of my head anyway when I heard him say the fort would automatically cut out the brains of anyone that wasn't supposed to get in. Security is one thing but this sounded a bit extreme. I wondered who Max meant by \"anyone\" and just exactly how the building would know which brains to cut out and which to leave alone. It seemed kind of important so I asked the question out loud but no one commented, or even acknowledged having heard me. I had a horrifying mental image of casually strolling into the fort one day only to hear alarms sounding \"Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert\" just before a set of automated knives descends to slice off the top of my head and scoop out my poor brains. I order the fort to stop but an eerily calm voice says \"I'm sorry Alexander, I'm afraid I can't do that\" and a split second later I'm de-brained and ready to vote Democrat (and you know how I feel about jackasses). Why would anyone want to build something so horrible? Max went on to describe other crazy stuff I don't remember while drawing in the sand, and at one point he bumped the Bull's foot with the scepter. The Bull looked down and for a moment we all paused and starred at him to see if he might actually say something for once. I wanted him to ask about the brain cutting machine and thought \"come on you silent bastard, back me up! Maybe they'll listen to you!\" but he just groaned (ooh, what a surprise) and Max continued talking and drew around his foot. Wait, I just realized why the fort tower looks like a crescent. Never mind, not important. I stood there in disbelief. Max was asking Ira a question but I tried to interrupt and said I didn't want my brains cut out. I assumed the others didn't want their brains cut out either, but again they all just ignored me. In fact, Ira said the fort was already making him happy. What the hell? The idea of a building that might turn on him faster than a Rottweiler and rip his head open was making him happy? I'm used to being ignored but normally Judith or someone would tell me to be quiet which showed they had at least heard me make a sound. But now they were ignoring me to the point of absurdity, and for a second I wondered if a hole had opened in the space-time continuum and was absorbing the sound of my voice. That's it, I'd had enough. Screw them if they wanted to play Russian roulette with their brains! Whatever happened would be on their heads, literally. Just don't come crying to me when you're lying in a pool of blood and goo with the top of your head off and your brains oozing into the dirt. I made a mental note to build some sort of hardhat out of the toughest sticks I could find. But of course I never had to make the hat because later I realized Max was only brainstorming about the brain cutting device and we never built it. I'm just telling what I thought at the time because it's all part of the story. One good thing that came from the whole experience with Max is that I'm now far less gullible than I once was. Max finished his excited description of the fort, paused, and asked us what we thought. It was nice to be asked but I also knew it was a mistake, because if you ask the seven of us what we think you'll get a dozen opinions. Surprisingly, this time only Judith spoke up and said she didn't think it could work, but then sounded a more positive note by adding she liked sleeping in a real pile. Not that it had anything to do with the fort. Max looked at Carol and earnestly asked if he would be in charge of building the fort. Well it wasn't as if he was going to ask me. But I didn't want the job and wasn't the best choice anyway. I'm excellent at stick weaving and small, detailed work but don't have experience with big building projects. Nope, I have to admit either Carol or Douglas was the obvious choice, and of course Douglas always plays Mr. Smithers to Carol's Mr. Burns. He hesitated to accept but I knew it was probably just posturing. Believe me, Carol loves calling the shots. Douglas said Carol was the only one that could pull off the project, and while I knew he wanted to encourage and support his best friend I thought it sounded a little like sucking up. Douglas is always trying to make Carol feel important. I have no idea what it must be like to have someone in your corner all the time. Max asked KW for her opinion and she said Carol was the only one that could handle the build. Naturally Carol agreed with them. Judith cinched it when she threatened to take on the job if Carol didn't. I'd like to see that. I love Judith but she's to impulsive to pull off something that complicated, and the moment a problem arose would most likely loose it and bludgeon the nearest person with whatever object was at hand. Carol finally accepted and didn't waste any time getting started. That very afternoon he, Douglas and Max began surveying the perimeter while the rest of us gathered materials. Naturally I was posted to the stick finding detail because (say it with me) I'm good at finding sticks . Wow, I feel like someone is actually getting to know me for once. Too bad I picked up a bundle of sticks with a wasp's nest in it. I can just imagine how funny it must have been to watch a big (well, biggish) bad Wild Thing madly swatting away at tiny little insects, but it beats getting the living hell stung out of you. All of us are very strong, but the Bull and Carol are probably the strongest and they worked on gathering the large tree trunks and rocks we needed. Ira worked at digging the tunnels while KW broke larger tree branches into smaller beams. All of us are actually pretty good builders and after only a few hours the construction area showed considerable progress. As we worked on what was already a massive project Max continued to ramble on about all sorts of wacky features he wanted added to the fort. If we had tried to build exactly what he wanted it would have taken us forever. To their credit, Carol and Douglas just focused on what could actually be done with the materials and time available. It was purely a shake n' bake operation, and I helped. But I won't go into all the details of the build. Just picture lots of quarrying, lifting, carrying, digging, shifting and other verbs ending with \"ing\" related to a major building project. It was amazing how much of the fort we completed in a surprisingly short (and unspecified) period of time. There must be some written equivalent to a visual montage but I have no idea how to do it, so anyone reading this can just fill in the gaps as best they can. The fort was shaping up nicely and I for one thought it was beautiful. The basic design was inspired by our rounded huts but the scale was unlike anything we'd ever attempted. My stick weaving added a dynamic, organic appearance to the fort, and was some of my best handiwork if I do say so myself. And I just did. But my favorite contribution was the hundreds of red flowers we added to break up all the earth tones. Yeah that was my idea. Plus we could snack on them. Sometimes you have to take time to stop and eat the flowers. No doubt about it, the fort was a great idea, and I looked forward to living in it. Hell, I was even ready to forgive Carol for destroying the huts. But of course that was before I knew he would soon want to honor us with an encore performance of his hackneyed and poorly received Magnum Opus , Out of Control Concerto No. 1 in A-flat-hut major, but this time featuring the fort. When it comes to uncontrollable rage and senseless destruction Carol is quite the maestro. Yeah, a regular Ludwig van Jackass.[Chapter 13] At the end of my last writing I screwed up and mentioned something about Carol wanting to destroy the fort. Sorry for the spoiler. I really like the foreshadowing thingy and have already used it a few times, but letting you know the fort might be in danger even before we finished building it might have been a bit clumsy. Anyway, now you know Carol had (or from your perspective, will have) another conniption fit that could threaten the fort. But put it out of your mind for now because it's in the future. Well, not really the future since it already happened; I mean in the future in this writing, but my past. I never thought about it but this writing thing is almost like a form of time travel. I can zoom backward and forward through all the time I've ever known and drop you down wherever and whenever I want. Behold the awesome power of Alexander! I'm like H.G. frigging Wells or something. Just kidding. As a reminder, \"kidding\" is NOT a goat pun, and I just say that to let you in on my stupid little jokes. I try never to do puns; remember what Oscar Wilde said about them being the lowest form of humor or whatever. Actually, I'm a little like Oscar Wilde on account of my dry wit and all (would that make me a Wilde Thing?). But of course without the gayness because I'm a straightgoat. No, not scapegoat , straightgoat. Well I am sometimes made the scapegoat when anything goes wrong around here which is practically all the time. By the way, goatscaping is when I groom my fur, but let's not go down the TMI road again. I should probably dial down the goat references, since I'm only part goat and part…well, we don't really know, do we? Back to the writing-as-time-travel-thing; anyone can do it, if they know how to write. I was the first to take to writing but I think a few of the others have also figured it out. I saw Carol practicing writing in the sand once but he rubbed it out when he saw me watching and pretended like he was digging for clams or something. Hey buddy, good luck making paper and a squirrel powered writing machine! I'm way ahead of you there. What the hell was I going to write about before I got so distracted? Oh right, the fort. Work on the fort continued at a frenzied pace and I have to admit Carol and Douglas did a great job keeping things on track. Everyone did their bit; well, mostly everyone. Max helped a little, but really his strength and building skills are just nothing like ours. I guess you can say he supervised, which is a polite way of saying he pretty much just talked the entire time, drank coffee and watched us work. That's management for you. Just kidding about the coffee, we don't even have any here. But since the fort was Max's idea I guess he did do his bit after all. Now I'm thinking about coffee, which is odd since I've never even seen any (more damn useless MK). But for some strange reason I almost feel like I've tried it before.* Maybe we can grow coffee and hire Juan Valdez to come pick it for us. He can leave his donkey at home and just saddle up Carol instead. I could really go for a cup of java right about now. And I mean real coffee, not some ridiculous fru-fru monstrosity like a septuple Ristretto Espresso Macchiato, brewed from über-organic beans grown in the ruins of Palenque and picked at the seventh hour of the seventh day of the seventh month by red-haired Pygmy virgins, ludicrously hot, sub-skinny free-range unicorn milk with polyhedral honeycomb structured foam, organic Saguaro and Eucalyptus syrup, layered, and stirred with a splinter from the Ark of the Covenant. Give me a break! Max also helped by humming tunes and singing songs for us which kept the mood upbeat and everyone's spirits high. I'm just thankful he didn't whistle while we worked as that would have been a bit too much. Although a legion of little laboring woodland creatures would have been damn useful, especially birds to fly in building materials. I asked Douglas if he knew the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow since I wondered if we could use them for transporting sticks or something, but he asked if I meant an African or European swallow and for some reason I was afraid to answer that. Speaking of birds, duck tape would have really come in handy. One song Max sang that I really liked had the line \"All is Love\", and I like to think we built the fort with love. I'm speaking figuratively there because we built the fort mostly out of tree trunks, about a zillion sticks, mud stucco and nipa palm glue. I love the smell of nipa palm in the morning! Max's type of music was new to us, but we already had our own kind of music before he arrived. During those rare times when the seven of us aren't bickering and KW is around we sometimes harmonize our voices for hours. We don't sing words or anything, like Max showed us, but just sort of blend our voices into melodic tones that are actually very complex. † Think J.S. Bach counterpoint complex. We can only do it when all seven participate. We performed for Max one night at the fort and he seemed genuinely amazed and said it was one of the most beautiful things he'd ever heard. One afternoon as work on the fort began to slow something happened that really rained on our parade. Everyone had been getting along since Max decreed the fort, and for the most part it had been a happy couple of days. Even Mr. Grumpy Carol was more like his old self. I had also been almost cheerful, except for that time everyone ignored the hell out of me when I tried to warn about the brain cutting thing. Anyway, most of the others were on a break, but since I often had to wait until the heavy beams were in place to do my stick weaving I was still working on top of a wall and had a good view of everything. Judith and Ira were resting together at the tunnel opening and the Bull was working on the tower just above them. Douglas was somewhere at the other end of the fort and KW was away gathering sticks. Max and Carol had just finished installing hundreds of red flowers along a perimeter wall and were reclining together admiring their work. The flowers were my idea but of course I meant they should go in after the fort was completed, but at least they had half way listened to me. I'll take what I can get in the \"OK, let's grudgingly acknowledge that we heard Alexander speak and not ignore him to the point of absurdity so that he will wonder if a hole has opened in the space-time continuum and is absorbing the sound of his voice\" department. Even the dogs are happy to eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table and all. The pace had slowed and as the day moved into late afternoon the place had a general atmosphere of quiet relaxation. I chuckled to see Carol had a flower in his mouth, and noted that with Max around he seemed truly at ease for the first time in a long while. I even allowed myself to forgo my usual skepticism about things improving and strayed into cautious optimism, wondering if we might actually begin to enjoy a new era of unity and harmony with Max as our king (poor self-deluded fool that I was!). That damn goat sense comes and goes without so much as a by-your-leave-sir. Max took Carol by the hand, and using one of his claws began scratching on a large log at the base of the wall. At first I was puzzled but then realized he was carving something into the wood. Carol seemed curious and just let Max guide his hand, and a moment later Max finished. Carol looked at the log, smiled, and began to carve something of his own. Later I went to see what they had done and found a capital letter \"M\" surrounded by a heart shape. I can only assume Max wrote his initial and Carol added the heart. Elementary, my dear Watson. Getting back to what I was saying, after Max saw what Carol had carved he grinned like a Cheshire cat and threw his arms around Carol's neck. Carol closed his eyes and put his arm on Max's back. For a second I wasn't sure what the hell to think and was afraid Max would say something like \"oh Carol darling, you've made me the happiest king in the world! I shan't ever forget this moment\" or something equally disturbing. Kidding again, I knew it was some sort of father/son bonding moment. Or maybe favorite Wild Thing/king. Something like that anyway. But to tell the truth the next moment that green-eyed monster, jealousy, began clawing at my mind and I felt my anger rising. From the very beginning I had suspected Max favored Carol, and now there could be no doubt. Thanks for rubbing it in, you thoughtless bastards. I started to shout \"get a room\" at them just to be hateful, but didn't. Then Carol did something that stopped my anger cold. He began to howl, and it was unlike any sound I'd ever heard him utter before. It was similar to the howling we had all done together at the cliff the morning Max arrived, but there was something in it that I just couldn't put my claw on, something somber, soulful and full of warmth. That howl and the expression I saw on Carol's face sent the green-eyed monster packing, and all my anger and resentment fled like mice from a burning hut. Sure, I wished Max cared about me like he did Carol, but even though I was on the outside looking in I couldn't help but be moved by the way they seemed to connect at that moment. Damn I'm such a softie, don't tell anyone. Then I noticed Judith starring at them with an annoyed look and knew in an instant the green-eyed monster had found alternate prey. As Max and Carol returned to work I watched Judith and didn't like the way she kept glaring at Max. I know her, and feared what she might do. The others seemed oblivious; Ira nuzzled her shoulder, Bull worked on the tower, Carol was now preoccupied with a large tree trunk and Max messed with a pile of sticks near a wall. By the way his stick weaving left a lot to be desired and I had to redo about half of all his work. I'll let you guess if he ever thanked me. After a few minutes Judith made the \"psst\" sound to Max and he looked in her direction. She held up a hand and made the \"come here\" signal with her claw, and I wondered if Max would just imperiously ignore her or oblige and approach. Max sort of narrowed his eyes, scowled and then made a show of looking all around before saying \"you talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Then who the hell else are you talkin' to?\" Naw, he didn't say that, it just popped into my head as I watched. But I almost wish he had said it. Max hesitated but then slowly walked toward her. Ira seemed disinterested and the Bull just watched and said nothing. Why did I even mention that? Of course he only watched and said nothing, that's what he does. Sometimes it really irritates me and I don't even know why. I was too far away to hear the conversation but could see Judith talking and gesturing at Max, and from his body language it was clear he wasn't pleased with what she was saying. Judith scowled as she talked and Max fidgeted a bit. Then she appeared to laugh, but not in a pleasant way. Max imitated her laugh which seemed to really tick her off. I hoped Max would take the high ground and refuse to spar with her. Judith curled her lips and sarcastically laughed again, and Max responded in kind. Each exchange was louder and longer than the last, until they were all but shouting at each other. Then I noticed Carol had stopped working and was also watching, just standing there still holding a large beam. He looked upset but said nothing. Judith opened her mouth wider with each retort, as did Max, and their loud, sardonic cries of \"ha ha ha\" echoed throughout the canyon. Max wasn't going to back down after all, and at one point he actually leaned in close to Judith's open mouth while shouting at her, which was brave but also incredibly stupid. Careful Chum, she's like a Great White, and if you want to get that close you're going to need a bigger boat. In a tone reminiscent of his aforementioned \"be still\" command Max managed a final volley of mock laughter that actually silenced Judith, and her face registered genuine surprise. But Max's victory was short lived, and what I had feared now came to pass. Judith totally went off on him, and this time I caught some of what she said, despite their distance from me. She shouted something about it being her job to get upset, and that it was his job to let her eat him if that's what she wanted to do, and other such nonsense. Max said nothing and stood with his head slightly down. It looked like Judith had gotten the better of him. No one said anything. It was an uncomfortable moment and I felt bad for him. Was this any way to treat a king? And why did he put up with it? I remembered his stories about exploding giant Viking heads and powers from ancient times, but at that moment he didn't look very kingly or invincible. Once again I found doubt gnawing at my mind. I hadn't noticed KW return but suddenly she was there, just in time to witness the final exchange between Max and Judith. KW said something to Max and he turned toward her, then both started to walk away. Judith lunged, grabbed Max by the ankle, held up her hand to his face and said something to him, but I couldn't hear it. My muscles tensed, as if preparing me to spring into action, but I was too far away to do anything and remained as I was. KW pulled Max away while stomping her foot down on Judith's wrist just hard enough to make her let go. Judith shouted and released her grip, allowing Max to take a few steps back. KW leaned in and said something to Judith, but since KW remained calm the whole time and never shouted or anything I couldn't hear what she said. As KW and Max walked away Judith shouted after them, and this time I heard her just fine. She said \"you think you have power, KW?\" or something similar. KW just ignored her and kept walking. Judith shouted \"I'm talking to you\" but KW made no sign of having heard her, but Max turned his head and looked back. \"No, not you – still talking to KW\" shouted Judith, which was actually a little funny when I look back at it. Remember when I said my name is ironic because I didn't do much to protect Max? Well this was one time when I could have at least tried. But Carol also just stood there and said nothing. That really surprised me because it seemed like he should have been the first to defend Max. All of us just sat there and did nothing. I've seen Carol stand up to Judith plenty of times, so why not then? KW never said another word and just walked with Max out of the fort toward the woods, her head held high. \"She walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies; and all that's best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes.\" I don't think I ever loved her more than at that moment. Judith seethed. Ira put his hand on her shoulder but she flung it away. Carol remained standing exactly as he had been the whole time, still holding the large tree trunk, a pained expression I couldn't quite read spreading across his face. He blinked a few times then slowly lowered his head and looked at the ground. Perhaps he felt ashamed, or was just upset to see someone else ruin the peace instead of him. I can understand if that's what was going through his mind; but I can't judge him without condemning myself. Carol sighed, dropped the beam, and slowly shuffled away. Judith and Ira slipped into the tunnel and out of sight. The Bull had descended from the tower without my having noticed and I caught a glimpse of him in the distance as he climbed out of the ravine. I was alone. For several minutes I sat, unmoving, listening to the mournful sound of the wind howling through the skeleton of the uncompleted fort. Then I picked up a stick and halfheartedly began to weave it into the wall. * Alexander is correct; he has had coffee before. In an alternate universe while in Max's world he discovered coffee in all its caffeinated splendor.

This is my first try to a good witch- story. I've only watched the series and not the movies. And this story is AU after the last episode of series 4, \"Tossing the Bouquet\" So anything in the Halloween Special that has aired or in the future doesn't matter. Okay? Well, this story starts at Nick and Grace's graduation from high school. And I don't remember it mentioning where Nick and Grace were going to college so I made something up. That's about all you need to know about that… … And too. I have an Instagram account where I put up pictures about the fanfictions I work on, if you want to find it, it's called \"Linneagbfanfiction\" and I put up updates on what chapters I'm working on and stuff. And a bit ago it was let's see now… twelve years ago since my grandma passed away. And she died from liver cancer. And I already have a couple of stories for Epilepsy awareness and I mentioned I wanted to write something for Liver cancer awareness and show that it does happen and it doesn't just happen to alcoholics and drug addicts (Not saying anything insulting about those)… And I also wanted to write something for good witch and here we are. I hope you like it. This first chapter is told from Sam's point of view. Future chapters it might switch in between different people's pov. But I'll always let you know when it changes so I hope it won't be a problem. The cover photo is my photo, and the same as for the story \"Love is stronger than hate\". That story doesn't have anything to do with this one. But I thought the picture suited with the title. I think I shot it at church once about a thousand years ago. Okay, now I'm done. \"So… Nick decided he wants to be an electrician…\" Cassie mentioned while she and I were searching for seats in Middleton High School's auditorium to watch our children graduate. \"…That's not a bad profession is it?\" \"Not at all. Here…\" I found a line of chairs were there were two empty seats next to each other, led Cassie in first and then sat down at the end myself. \"Not as good as being a doctor. But Nick faints at the sight of a needle so I guess I let go of that hope by the time he was little and had his vaccines…\" I couldn't help but smirk- I couldn't give any less about what profession Nick chose as long as he was happy and healthy. \"The college was called Winterville I think. It's in Chicago… kid's longing back to the big city. At Winterville he would also has a chance to play football so I think it's going to be perfect for him.\" \"Grace isn't going quite so far away. She's only going to Bayshore College of medicine. Where they spend their first year of college looking into all professions in medicine. And then for the second year and the rest they choose one and then they study- a lot!\" \"And we both know which medical profession is the best and correct one to choose.\" Cassie lightly hit my arm and laughed, I couldn't help but laugh to. How I had learnt to love these two girls- apart from Nick the two most important parts of my life. \"It's about to start now.\" I cleared my throat (as if I would have needed to do that) and sat up properly when Principal Charles Whitlock walked over to the microphone that stood on the stage, glanced towards the curtains on the stage leading to the hallway. In which all the students about to graduate stood in their graduation caps and gowns. Talking in between parents and siblings died out and the large room fell quiet. \"Thank you.\" Principal Whitlock started at last. \"Now, I know none of these parents, grandparents, siblings or other families can wait to see your child, grandchild, sibling come out. Or whoever you came here to see. But just a second- I am Charles Whitlock and I am the principal for you who don't know that. People call me Charlie but you... may not! And here we go.\" He riffled in some sheets of paper he held. \"There's a big screen behind me and you have all sent in old pictures from when your graduates were younger. And I sure hope some of you sent the most embarrassing ones. Now let's start from the beginning shall we?... Leonard Aaden.\" A tall, red haired boy came walking onto the stage. Behind him on the big screen showed a photo of him at two- or- so- years- old, with a big smile, the look in his eyes as if he knew he had done something he shouldn't have, and a big thatch of hair- as red as it still was now. With a smile, now he took a diploma from Principal Whitlock. Held it up and turned to the audience, and then half ran with big steps off the stage on the opposite side he had come in from. \"Shelly Abrams\" Since both Nick and Grace were on \"R\" I and Cassie knew we'd have to wait for a bit. Still, while I noticed there were people who didn't- we clapped and cheered as big for both Leonard Aaden and Shelly Abrams and everybody else that came up on stage until… \"Nicholas Radford.\" Never have I ever been an as proud father as when the picture on the screen on the pack of the stage showed two year old Nick, with wide- open hazel eyes and his finger up his nose. I could have watched that photo all day long. Then I saw my Nick come onto the stage in front of all these people, take the diploma that meant he had mastered all of his classes. And as he held it in the air and then hurried off the stage. Another second passed by and then a photo of two year old Grace turned up on the screen, with short, dark hair, a sweet smile, in a yellow dress end with a bouquet of flowers almost as big as her I couldn't help but feel a smile grow on my lips. A smile of another kind then the slight laughing at Nick's photo. \"Grace Russell.\" Clapping as hard as I possibly could I watched as Grace came onto the stage, smiling and with her dark hair- partly covered under the graduation cap flying after her as she made her way over to the Principal, took her Diploma and shook his hand. Held it up while I photographed from where I stood and then left. \"Maxwell Samuel.\" The graduation continued, during clapping and cheering until our arms and palms were warm and sore. But how could we not keep clapping and then have to choose for who he wouldn't? \"William Zachary Jr.\" Middleton's high school didn't have more than a couple of thousand students. Still, the seniors graduators' names reached all the way from A and at last to Z. When a young African- American boy came on the stage before we could finally stop clapping and let our arm fall towards the arm rests between the seats. \"Now…\" Principal Whitlock whipped his forehead pretending to be exhausted after all of those names that had to be called. \"Family, friends and enemies… Can I ask all the graduates to come out on stage again?\" He took the microphone and moved it to the very front of the stage before the teens walked back out. \"Is it me getting older or do the graduates get younger and younger for every year. Time for the graduation speech by one student who has done exceptionally well in all of her classes. Welcome forward, Grace Russell.\" \"Did you know she was going to do this?\" I leaned close to Cassie and whispered in her ear, she only shook her head back at me. Well, that must be a first for when somebody wanted to surprise her… That surely wasn't an easy thing to do. \"Hello everyone…\" Grace said into the microphone, I faced forward again and listened close to every word. \"…Since I found out I'd get the chance to do this I tried to think of something to say… And I wrote this really long speech. Then found one sentence I didn't like and I ended up throwing the whole thing away. And also, I think I'm talking for all of us when I say I really wouldn't mind the short kind of speech.\" I couldn't blame Grace for seeming more insecure and nervous than I'd ever seen before, and I could see her look around until at last she found her mum- and me who showed her two thumbs up and hope that she could see it in the dark. Even at the distance I could see a smile form on her lips and she raised slightly before she continue. \"…Then we could get out of here as soon as possible. And then I suddenly remembered that first day. Almost four years ago. When we were in our homeroom and the four years of high school ahead of us seemed like an eternity. And then time only flew by and here we are. After four years of high school. And during those four years… my God. Everything that's happened!... We made friends, we met bullies… we met new parts of our family…\" She looked to her side towards where Nick stood. \"There were bad days and good, during the beginning, before we found our way through the labyrinth of these hallways we ended up… a bit of everywhere really. We had A's… and B's. We complained over teachers and tests or other students we didn't like… we laughed and then we watched \"the impossible\" and at least half of us cried. We made relationships… we ended them again and at last. We are here today with four years of so many memories it seems like it must have been an eternity at least. And then I wondered how this could just be the end and then I realized…\" Grace made a pause, and for a moment I couldn't help but to feel a frown for in my forehead. It wasn't obvious if the pause was intentional or not and she almost seemed to be swaying dizzily where she stood. \"…And then I realized…\" Before I had the time to really worry Grace started again. \"…That I haven't even turned eighteen yet. And some of us are going to college… we'll keep in touch. And maybe in a whole lot of years some of us will meet up and maybe some of us will have children at the same age as we are now. And then I thought that with all that, and everything I don't know ahead of me… this can't be the end. It can't be the end because this is only the beginning.\" Grace stopped talking and glanced over the group ahead of me. \"Thank you for your time.\" Grace turned and walked back to the group to stand next to Nick, principal Whitlock had been standing right next to her and clapped along with the rest of us for Grace's speech. \"I think I'll have to agree with Grace on the one that I think no one in here would mind if we made this short. So… after those four years you lot…\" He stepped to the side and turned a bit so he could see at least some of the students. \"All luck in the future, off you go.\" A loud roar of cheering from all directions went through the auditorium, our teens ran in all directions since they would know all the ways out of here. So there was a whole lot of stumbling, excuse me's and pushing before we had found our way out on the school yard. And by then accompanied by both Linda, Brandon, Lori and Tara- well, that would make everyone except for our graduates. \"Lori…\" Grace suddenly came hurrying up to us. \"…Brandon, Tara. What are you doing here? Bran, you said you had to work…\" \"I couldn't miss my favorite sister's graduation could I?\" Lori pretended to be hurt. \"Congratulations Grace.\" They hugged tightly. \"Hey Sam… And congratulations to you too Nick.\" Nick just came walking up to me. \"Hey… I liked that old photo of you. Do you remember when it was shot?\" Brandon broke down laughing and had to lean towards Tara's shoulder not to fall. \"Very mature Brandon.\" Nick and Linda were both glaring at me for choosing the photo, especially at all Brandon's laughing and Tara's comment for it Nick turned as red as the graduation gown he was wearing. \"I'm not ashamed to admit I chose the most embarrassing one.\" Jokingly, Cassie slapped the back of my head and I couldn't help but laugh either. Brandon thought it was funny more than anyone else of us thought and was wiping tears from his eyes. \"You only think it's so funny because there's a picture of you that's just the same.\" Grace's comment had Brandon himself turning just as red as Nick was at this point. But then, Brandon didn't have to show his photo for several hundred people all at once. And it only had him laughing more. \"Aha, urgh, haha. Yep. I admit it. There's one just the same of me…\" Brandon said when he could breathe enough to talk again. \"Now. I wish I could come celebrate with you at whatever but I have to get to work…\" He hugged Grace one more time. \"We've got a present for you but we forgot it to make it in time. See you guys.\" I knew that after what happened to Jake, Cassie and Grace. As well as Lori always felt insecure when Brandon got his police- jacket on and left for work. And I always wanted to say something to at least get their mind on other things. \"I guess… should we get home and have some celebration. With you, me, you, you, you…\" I pointed to Cassie, myself, then Grace, Nick and Linda. \"And George was on his way too and I guess whatever people are at the hotel right now.\" \"I have to go. I have to work too. Congratulations dear.\" Linda hugged Nick tightly one more time. \"See you some time.\" With that she left too. I tried not to look at her- away from the risk I would make this moment about her and me. Tara was leaving too to get a ride of Brandon, so she gave Grace a quick hug and then ran after him… \"Actually… I know we've been spending as good as every day all the time together lately but… The class has come along about putting an end to it with a late lunch just about now. And everybody's going…\" With a hopeful glance in her eyes Grace looked to her mum. \"…I can go, can I? If you want to have some sort of celebration we can have it… later…\" \"Of course you can go. We can do that anytime. Have fun, what about you Nick?\" \"Oh. I'm eighteen. I don't have to ask for permission, I can just go. Especially after you just showed everybody that old picture.\" And I would probably never hear the end of it now. \"It was your mum who shot it.\" Nick just rolled his eyes at me, but I could see a small smile that had formed on his lips- he might or might not be as embarrassed as he was acting. \"Have a great time you two.\" I just smiled while Nick and Grace were about to walk away. \"And don't worry about anything. You'll have plenty of time for that for the rest of your lives but not tonight. Okay?\" I and Cassie had walked to the school not to have to worry about finding a parking so we started walking back. \"It feels good that when my daughter walks away like that I don't have to worry that she'll come home in a police car in the middle of the night or get drunk or do drugs or anything. I don't even have to mention it- she knows to make the right choices.\" I smiled- I trusted my son by now but by the time back we lived in New York it had been a whole other stories… We didn't say anything to each other on the whole way back, I on one side was re- living a bunch of memories from my own graduation and Nick's whole childhood. Right on my left I'd guess that Cassie was doing the same but about Grace up until we walked up to Grey House and found a small family we hadn't met before in the hallway. In form of two young adults, one man and a woman. And a young girl about four or five. \"Welcome to Grey House. I'm so sorry. Have you waited for long?\" \"Not at all. We just got here. And I'm sorry. We said we were going to be here in two hours first so it's not your fault we ended up here… well… we could go around and around about this all day. But we're all here now and no harm done.\" Cassie got behind the small reception desk she had. \"The name's Clover. Victor Clover.\" \"And as you may know my name is Cassandra Nightingale but you can call me Cassie.\" The little girl Victor Clover had sitting on his hip was wearing a smile from ear to ear and that look on her face of a child that was never silent for long. \"And my name is Candelaria Eloise Clover.\" \"What a beautiful name.\" Cassie smiled brightly at the young girl with a big, teal bow in her dark hair. \"Candle, healthy or sun and Clover… sounds like your whole name will bring you luck.\" Candelaria only toothlessly smiled just as bright back while Cassie took the right key from the drawer in front of her. \"Room number five. Just up the stairs here and to the left. If there's anything you wonder then I'm here and…\" We could hear footsteps coming up the driveway and without looking up when he came in Cassie greeted \"Hey George- you can ask him too if there's anything you wonder about, he knows everything there is to know about this house. Do not fear. Rather ten questions too many than one too little. The kitchen is over there and feel free to use whatever you can find in there. Although that part of the house…\" She pointed in the other direction. \"Is our living area so don't come in there unless you are invited and with one of us. Was that everything?\" Since I was rarely here when new guests arrived I sometimes forgot how much there was to remember when another new one came to stay and even I, who lived here every day had forgotten about half of what she had said already. \"Should I help you carry your bags…\" \"My name is Candelaria Eloise Clover. And you can help me carry my backpack…\" Mr. Clover let his daughter down to stand on her own two feet and started pulling her backpack off, Mr. Clover himself took each big trunk in each hand and looked as if about to say something. \"And I'm George.\" He helped Mrs. Clover take one bag and took the little, frozen- themed backpack and threw it over one shoulder. \"George O 'Hanrahan.\" \"That's a weird name!\" I had to bite my lip not to laugh at the little girl's comment. How many times hadn't I thought the same? Children and their honest ways… \"Candeleria!\" Mr. Clover scolded. \"That isn't a very nice thing to say is it? And…\" He took the small backpack from George's shoulder and gave it back to Candeleria who pouted. \"Oh no. You packed yourself and wanted all of your toys with you. So you can carry that one yourself as well.\" Candeleria was pouting still, and I still had to bite my lip not to make a sound while I looked away and tried to take a breath. It wasn't exactly made any easier when George leaned down so only the little girl would be able to hear him- I heard it too as I was standing right next to them. \"Actually…I agree with you. I have a very weird name! But I do think your name is very pretty.\" The little girl only smiled back (I was starting to think she always smiled- but knowing kids her age, probably not), pulled her backpack on and before her parents and George made her way up the stairs. \"What a lovely little girl.\" I nodded agreeing and watched the Clover's move up the stairs with their little one first and her pink backpack bumping back and forth towards her back. \"It feels like only yesterday Grace was about that age.\" \"Grace?\" George turned around at the top of the stairs. \"It feels like only yesterday my Jenny was about that age. When Grace was feels like it should have been only minutes ago.\" Something sad always got into George's voice when he talked about his daughter. For a parent to lose a child was the worst thing that could ever happen to a person, no matter what age. And I could feel something squeezing my heart while I turned to Cassie who was wearing a frown I just recognized way too well. \"What? What's going on?\" \"I just have such a weird feeling something is about to go wrong.\" I raised an eyebrow- since when couldn't Cassie place the exact feelings as what was about to go wrong or who it was standing behind her or anything? \"I know. I know. When people come into the store I just know. But when it's about someone I love- you, or Grace or Nick… then it's not as clear. I just get a feeling and I had that feeling the night Jake died and…\" Without finishing the sentence she closed her eyes and drew a deep sigh. \"I'm sorry. It's probably nothing. I just watched my daughter graduate so what shouldn't I feel for the moment being?\" \"And that you're right about.\" George came down the stairs. \"I remember… sorry. I don't want to get into that when its' Grace and Nick's graduation day…\" \"I have to go.\" Before neither I nor Cassie could say anything else George disappeared. Cassie shook her head and I could see she tried to ignore the feeling. \"I just have to do some paperwork back at the clinic. I won't be gone for long. An hour or two at the most.\" I leaned forward and kissed Cassie's cheek. \"Try not to worry so much. The kids are just having fun. We'll be able to celebrate a bit more someday… I'll be back soon.\" And when I left Grey House that afternoon. Little did I know that those couple of hours of \"soon\" would be the first few whiles of something that made everything change. Candelaria and her parents looks like Scout Larson, Kristoffer Polaha and Lodovica Comello. Random fact (I leave one or more of these in every chapter I put up) I really wanted to come up with something better for Grace's graduation speech. But what is here is what I came up with and hopefully you guys don't think it was too bad. And at last, English is not my first language. If you see any faults in grammar or anything could you be so kind and write it in a review or a pm and I'll try to make it better next time I use it? Thank you. (And please, write what is the problem and not just there's a problem. Because if you do the latter I can impossibly know what it is- thank you!)[Chapter 2] Hello! And thanks to Rangerbaldwin for reviewing. Some of you might have seen the new notes I put up with the first chapter a couple of days after I put the chapter up. But I'll be deleting those, because I thought that maybe they sounded a bit rude. When I wrote it I had once again been reminded that my English isn't as good as I'd like to believe it is. I was hurt and annoyed (fanfiction is pretty much everything my life revolves around so…) and it was in the middle of the night so very tired. Upon that I had also misunderstood parts of the review I'd gotten. And when I realized this I felt really bad. But then… (I'm sorry about all these long Author's notes). Well, as I've already said English isn't my first language. And I'd like for people to point out my mistakes. For one thing- I did not know there was a difference between the word \"Headmaster\" and the word \"Principal.\" They've been changed now and I'm going to make sure I stick to the correct one. Another mistake I am actually very aware of is \"Mum\" instead of \"mom\" and that is because when I was new here I was confused and trying to use the right one and then I ended up using one about every other time and the other the rest. Do you get what I mean? Anyway, I stick to \"mum\". And I hope all people can be happy with that. Do you think that the difference in between British and American English is obvious and I'm stupid? Well to me the difference in between Swedish and Norwegian is obvious. While for a person who doesn't understand neither it might not be. Do you get my point? I'm also aware that Grace and Nick's ages might be a bit wrong. But if so, look at it as if a teeny tiny bit AU. Anyway. Those are the A/N's for this time. And I'd still like for people to point out my mistakes please. Those one or two hours I was going to be at the clinic ended up being five. I just wanted all of that paper work done so I could really have a weekend off for once. And finally, late in the afternoon I could drive home to Grey House. When I stepped over the threshold drawing for a deep breath, it felt like the world being lift off my shoulders. Unknown to me was the fact that things were only minutes, if not only seconds from changing. \"Something smells good.\" I made my way into the kitchen where Cassie stood by the stove sorting out dinner. But she didn't answer me. \"Hello? Earth to Cassie.\" I teased her and smirked, she turned and looked at me but still didn't say anything. \"What's up?\" I suddenly remembered what she had said about the feeling she'd had but didn't have the time to ask anything more before she interrupted. \"Sorry. I'm just a bit…\" It seemed unlike Cassie when she couldn't find the words to finish the sentence. \"Grace came home about an hour ago. She said she wasn't feeling well and went to bed.\" She laid a hand towards the side of her stomach- right underneath her lowest rib but right then I barely noticed it. \"Can you go check on her? I just have a feeling and I can't figure out what it is about\" I had learnt by now that Cassie's feelings should be taken seriously. But still, she was a mother. And from what I knew about those they didn't always need a reason to worry as much as they sometimes did. Or even at all. There would be no reason for me, nor Grace nor anybody else to worry too much before we even knew a smidge of what was actually going on. I patted Cassie's shoulder on my way through the kitchen and then made my way up the stairs and to Grace's bedroom door. \"Grace?\" I knocked on the door but couldn't hear any reply at first. \"Are you awake? Can I come in?\" I waited for another second, with still no answer I carefully pushed the door handle down as quietly as I could and barely opened the door just a little. Then leaned ed in just enough to see if Grace was asleep. If she was I'd do this later but she seemed to be just waking up, rubbing her eyes and sitting up. \"Can I come in?\" \"Yeah… Sorry I didn't answer.\" \"No worries. Your mother said you weren't feeling well. And she asked me to check on you.\" I stepped into the room and closed the door after me. \"How are you feeling?\" Without any further ado I pushed her fringe away and felt her forehead with my palm. \"…You don't feel warm. I don't think you have a temperature. Are you in pain?\" \"No.\" Grace shook her head. \"It's just my stomach. It doesn't hurt. It just feels very strange and I feel a bit nauseas.\" \"Should I get you a bucket?\" She shook her head again. \"Well, this couldn't hurt. Or well, it could. But you must understand I'd have to make an examination at this. As for any other patient. Lay down, roll onto your back and pull your shirt up.\" Grace didn't protest and did as I told her right away and didn't make a sound when I started feeling and pressing different points of her stomach. My hands working more on muscle memory than that I was actually concentrating. Myself, I was more concentrated on Grace herself because I had a feeling even if it did hurt she might not tell me. But then, feelings were about Cassie's thing and not mine. I just knew what Grace was like. \"I will tell you if it hurts. I promise.\" And then there was that thing with Cassie and Grace always somehow knowing what I was thinking. I ignored it for the moment and just continued with what I was doing. But still Grace wasn't making a sound at all and I could only hope she was keeping her promise. \"Have you heard about any of your friends getting food poisoning from something you've been eating at a restaurant?\" Grace shook her head once more when I started asking questions. \"Or any of your not- so- much- friends?\" She just rolled her eyes at me but couldn't hide a small smile forming on her lips. \"Have you been having any constipation or diarrhea?\" \"Sam!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Sorry but I have to ask.\" Still no reaction about anything and I was starting to wonder if this would come to a result when suddenly the picture of Cassie only a few minutes ago passed by for my inner vision and how she'd put her hand to her side. Was it possible? No… She was just… It was just body language and… no… Barely knowing about what I was doing I moved my hands further up along Grace's stomach. She seemed a bit embarrassed after what I had just asked and everything. I just wanted to get this done as soon as possible. Even though more for Grace's sake than my own… \"OW.\" At last, when I pressed the upper, right part of her stomach Grace flinched and hissed. Right away I stood up straight and lifted my hands. I didn't need more than that at this moment. \"There are a whole lot of muscles and tendons right there. If you've been cheering with holding your arms over your head or something like that, you might have strained something.\" I rubbed my neck- not sure whether I should continue this or not. \"I don't think it has something to do with how you're feeling. If you're asking me- which your mother is. I think you're just exhausted after a whole lot of years in school. And now you've got the summer off before college. And then you've just relaxed and then you're feeling like… this. I'm saying we should leave this now hold on for a few days. If you're still feeling like this then I'll run some tests. If you're better we can move on with our lives. Okay? Does that sound like a good deal?\" \"It does.\" I smiled at her and meant to turn around and leave to share with Cassie what was going on. Cassie was still Grace's guardian- but I still wanted for Grace to give her \"okay\" and if she'd like to come with me and talk herself. But then something changed. And that was at the moment I and Grace looked each other in the eyes. \"Hold on a second. Just lie absolutely still Grace.\" I took a few steps back, turned the lamp in the ceiling off and then the smaller one by her bed on so I could see her eyes clearer. Also the color of them. \"Your eyes…\" I didn't finish the sentence while I carefully laid a thumb towards her eyelid and pulled it up so I could see her Sclera's better. \"What does my eyes have to do with anything?\" \"The sclera's are looking slightly yellow.\" Before having turned the ceiling lamp off I thought what I had seen was just a reflection. But as it was turned off and the bed lamp turned away the yellow tone was undeniably still there. I could feel something clench in my stomach when I just had to admit it really was. \"What does that mean?\" \"Has it happened some time lately that you've eaten something somebody else has made or someone else have been setting the table?\" \"Yeah. A lot of times. What about it?\" \"I think… Have you ever heard about hepatitis?\" I was trying to work out how exactly to explain- this wasn't my expertise. \"Well… I think that we should go to the hospital. You and I, now. Just to get some blood tests that will show us if you've got it. And if so we'll just have to make sure it doesn't spread. For a young person with a good immune system like yours it shouldn't be any worse than a normal flu. But for small children, old or sick people. It could get much worse so we just need to know.\" Grace nodded and reached for her long- sleeved shirt that laid on a chair next to the bed. \"Should I go and tell your mum or do you want to come with me?\" \"I'm coming.\" Grace got up, stumbled a bit. I held out my arm and Grace took it and supported on me. \"I'm okay, just a little dizzy.\" I didn't let go, if Grace wanted and needed to hold on she could. \"So you… You wouldn't think it's anything worse than that would you?\" \"Anything else that could cause this is very rare among anybody else than newborn babies or old people. So no. I wouldn't think there's anything worse.\" When I looked to my side and down to her she didn't look so reassured. \"There's no reason to believe it's something else. And if it is, we'll worry about that when we get there. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"And now. Don't forget. I have contacts. I can make sure we get help at the moment we arrive at the hospital and then we can probably leave before we get the answers and only wait for them wherever we are. We could go home because they probably won't come until Monday or so. And sitting in a hospital waiting for time to pass by is terribly boring…\" Then at last, a small smile formed on Grace's lips and I felt her relax slightly. \"Cassie?\" She was still in the kitchen cooking and Candelaria Clover had joined her, currently sitting on the kitchen counter watching over what Cassie was doing. \"I'm going to take Grace to the doctor's.\" I had expected Cassie to look surprised. She looked more like she had already known which I should have understood. \"Her eyes are a bit yellow. I think she might have hepatitis. And if so I have an obligation to report it to make sure it doesn't spread. But I'm sure she's going to be fine.\" Cassie's worried expression didn't fade. But she did let Candelaria stir in the casserole and then reached into a cupboard for a bag of candies. \"Here.\" Cassie reached them to Grace while I tried to understand what on earth they were. This didn't seem like the time for sweets. \"It's pieces of dried ginger. They'll help against the nausea.\" \"Thanks mum.\" I took up my phone from my pocket and searched up the number to reception of the ER in my contacts. \"If Sam's doing what I think he's doing I don't think this would take a very long time.\" I could see Grace was obviously very tired and not feeling well. Cassie was very worried and with the feeling that something was wrong. But they were obviously both trying to fight against it, smiled at each other and then shared a hug. While I spoke to the receptionist on the phone I knew these were my family whether it was yet on paper or not. And I was set to care for and protect them. \"Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?\" Cassie asked once I hung up. \"I can come with you. George and Candelaria can take care of the dinner.\" \"Mum.\" Grace shook her hand. \"Seriously. I'm seventeen. I don't need you to hold my hand during a blood test.\" To finish that subject Grace stuck her hand down the plastic bag Cassie had given her, pulled up a piece of ginger and put it in her mouth. \"These are enough of you for the moment. They're really good.\" I had let go for a bit while we were still, now laid my arm back around Grace's shoulders and she laid hers around mine for support when we made our way outside to my car and left Grey House for the moment being. Grace was very quiet when I drove us towards the hospital. When I pulled over in my usual parking space behind the large building I would have thought she'd fallen asleep if she hadn't reached to unbuckle her belt before I'd turned the motor off. \"This way.\" I showed her through the back door. \"I was talking to some of my friends and one of them was going to be ready for us at the moment we arrived.\" I held out my arm again when Grace swayed and she took it sternly, once again supported towards me when we made our way through the staff entrance, the hallways in the cellar and then into the emergency room. \"And here we are…\" I could spot one of the receptionist's I'd been talking on the phone to earlier and she pointed to one of the examine rooms. \"THANK YOU… And… Grace. This is Mandy. Mandy this is Grace. And you've already got the info you needed right?\" \"Yes.\" Mandy nodded where she sat by the computer. \"Just wait here for a minute. I need to go and get some test tubes of the right kinds. You can just roll your sleeves up and then wait…\" Grace once again did as she was told right away. \"And here we go. Are you afraid of needles?\" \"No.\" \"That's good.\" I stroke her shoulder for even though she wasn't afraid a blood test wasn't exactly comfortable. \"I'm not either… well… that's as long as I'm not the one who needs it. If someone needs something of my blood...\" I just grimaced and didn't finish the sentence. \"I never knew that.\" Grace laughed tiredly. \"You spend your days giving people shots and drawing blood like this and yet you're the one who can't stand it?\" I only smiled and shook my head slightly. \"And you were teasing Nick about it?\" She flinched and hissed slightly when Mandy had poked a needle through her skin without giving a warning, I stroke her shoulder again. \"…I'm okay. I just wasn't ready. Sorry Nurse Mandy you did nothing wrong. I just whoa…\" Suddenly she blinked and swayed a bit where she sat. \"Sorry. I'm just a bit dizzy.\" \"Maybe you should lie down.\" \"No. I'm okay. It's gone now.\" \"And this is finished.\" With a number of test tubes filled up Mandy pulled off the tourniquet from Grace's arm and pulled out the needle. \"I'll look the results over today if I get the time. You should get them tonight or by Monday. During the weekend it will be wise if you follow the hygiene rules that comes with having hepatitis A as that's what we're suspecting. Make sure to wash your hands properly after going to the bathroom and before cooking. It's even better if you don't cook at all for anybody else- not even make a sandwich or set the table. Just common sense really. It can't spread through the air like a regular flu… And if there's anything more then you've got Dr. Radford there. And he'll be ready to answer any questions. So… You're fine to leave.\" Grace swayed again when she stood up but walked on her own two feet without leaning on me back through the hallway and to my car. And once there, she had been so silent yet awake when she drove here. I didn't notice when she just kind of slipped away until I pulled over in front of Grey House and turned to her. \"Is there anything I can… oh.\" For a moment I wondered about what would be the best thing to do. I turned to look behind me and down the driveway again. Then turned towards Grace who was slumped in her seat and with her cheek and forehead leaned against the cool window. For a moment I just sat there and watched how peaceful she looked sleeping before I had to make a decision. It had seemed so obvious I would have to get her inside… maybe I could carry her- she could impossibly be too heavy. And then something told me what the right thing to do was. I put the backing gear in and hit the gas pedal again to back out of the driveway and back down the street. Grace still didn't move an inch. There weren't many minutes after I'd driven away from Grey House until my phone that laid in between my seat and the shotgun seat lit up and started buzzing and ringing. \"I just saw you pull over into the driveway\" Cassie sounded worried when I heard her on the other end of the line. \"And then you waited. And then you disappeared again. Is everything alright? What are you doing?\" \"I am currently driving… I might actually be doing that for a while from now on. Grace is fine. She just fell asleep when we were going back. And she just looked so peaceful I didn't have the heart to wake her up even for a second to go inside. And then I remembered what Nick was like when he was little. Until he was five or so I and Linda would spend every single night on the roads.\" \"Aw.\" It did sound in her voice as if like Cassie had actually never loved me as much as in that very moment. \"Oh my. I'd almost forgotten by now... Jake used to drive around and around for hours when she was little. Most of the time she was a pretty calm baby. But some nights she just wouldn't sleep and then getting her warm and comfortable in the car seat and driving was the only thing that calmed her down…\" Cassie gave a short laugh. \"This is really kind of you Sam. I'm sure Grace appreciates it… or at least she will. When she wakes up.\" \"I don't mind.\" I stopped for a red light. \"But I don't want to wake her up from talking and I'm not too fond of talking on the phone while driving. So I'll hang up now and then we'll be back some time before bedtime. Okay?\" \"Okay… But… I still have a feeling something is ought to go wrong. Will you turn your phone off while driving please? Just so one risk is gone and away?\" \"I can do that honey.\" I hit the gas pedal again when the traffic light turned to green. \"See you later.\" \"Drive safely.\" I turned into the side for a second to do as I was told and turn my phone off. Grace stirred a bit and moaned when I hit the curb, but didn't wake up. And if it hadn't been for her eyes being yellow. At that moment I would have been surer than ever that she was actually \"only\" exhausted. The clock was ticking closer and closer to the moment I knew Cassie would at least want to go to bed. (Although I knew very well she wouldn't before we were back) Then at last, ten minutes before that Grace moaned, stirred and sat up straight. \"Where are we?\" She mumbled drowsily. \"What's going on? This isn't anywhere in between Grey House and the hospital is it?\" \"No it's not…\" I chose a bit back and forth if I should even tell her at the moment. \"You fell asleep when we were driving home. And I didn't have the heart to wake you up to get inside so I've actually been driving around for almost four hours. But don't worry. I've been driving around and around so it won't take us long to get back. Just try not to fall asleep again.\" \"You didn't have to do that. I'm sorry. Have you talked to mum? She must be worried now.\" \"I've talked with her. I just promised her we'd be home before her bedtime. Don't worry. You have nothing to be sorry for. I could use that practicing of driving… Are you feeling any better now than you did before?\" \"Yes. A little.\" She stretched as much as she could sitting with the belt and then rubbed her eyes. \"I'll try and stay awake now. But if I don't, then just wake me up when we get back. I never wanted you to have to drive around half the night for my sake.\" \"Don't worry about it.\" It wasn't more than a few minutes before I could turn in on the right street and over to the right house. \"I would do it all again. Do you need help getting out?\" She shook her head. I hadn't expected that despite the late night Cassie would have gone to sleep before we got back. And I was right, she knew we were coming in and was in the hallway when Grace stepped inside first and I right behind her. And then started with hugging her daughter tight while I turned my phone back on. Then couldn't help but frown when I saw the number that had tried to call me but ended up sending me a voice message. \"Hey. Dr. Radford? This is Mandy.\" I quickly showed Grace and Cassie to come closer and turned the speaker on, on my phone. \"I had a break and had the time to look over Grace's blood tests.\" But why call so soon? \"It doesn't look as if she has hepatitis. But there is something wrong. I still think there might be something wrong with her liver or her kidneys. I sent it to the lab. They'll check more closely and I'll make sure they call you whenever they know more. I hope you have a good weekend.\" My phone clicked and beeped with the end of the message. I turned it off, and could see moving in the corner of my eye while I looked to the floor trying to go through what I had just heard and how this could be explained except for hepatitis while I pushed my phone down my pocket. I was used to Grace and Cassie to both always being calm and steady. Cassie was still but I could see the worry shining from her eyes and Grace had started trembling. All of her was shivering from head to toe. \"I…\" I tried to say anything that would calm them down. \"I don't…\" My mouth had gone dry and I couldn't even think of the right word. \"I'm ill.\" Grace stated and interrupted whatever I could have said. It wasn't a question. \"I'm ill. Like really ill. I'm not just exhausted I'm not just over- stressed. I'm ill… really ill.\" What was I supposed to say? Grace had some medical knowledge including everything she'd been told tonight. But I was supposed to be the expert in this. So what was I supposed to say? \"I don't know.\" I'm thinking Principal Whitlock who was in the first chapter looks like Peter Graham- Gaudreau. And Nurse Mandy like Hallee Hirsh. I know the line \"It did sound in her voice as if like Cassie had actually never loved me as much as in that very moment.\" Is a bit weird. But there will be something later into the story referring to it. Random fact Okay. So here's the thing- I'm making as much thinking and reading and now I can't find the right word… about all the medical parts in this story. But some parts are and will be written a certain way to suit a storyline. Or they'll just be wrong, happening in some way they wouldn't. But this is the world of fanfiction and thinking about all wrong that goes on here (\"Cough\" Mpreg for example \"cough) I hope you can live with a fault, or a hundred in this story.

It felt strange it hadn't even been a week since graduation. Flashback On Monday after graduation I was called back from the hospital. On Tuesday I was half- lying on a hard hospital chair, with my shirt pulled up to my chest and an ultrasound transducer put towards my stomach. A man by name Dr. Peterson held onto it and watched an ultrasound screen right next to me in silence, Sam stood right behind me. His eyes fixated on the ultrasound screen too. It was so silent I could hear my own heart beating. And it was beating hard and loud. \"Excuse me…\" I tried after a while. \"Maybe… if it's not too much trouble. I'm not sure what I'm seeing at all. But I know you do, maybe you could tell me a bit what you are seeing and maybe… what does it mean?\" Dr. Peterson sent me a glare, he was obviously not too fond of the idea of having to speak about what he did. Then he looked up over the top of my head and on Sam. Then with a deep sigh he started…. \"Do you see this?\" Dr. Peterson pointed to the ultrasound screen while holding the transducer to my stomach. \"This is your liver. This part is great, and this part, and this part. But this part is not. And we've already drawn some blood tests and could see on them that your liver is not doing what it should. Here also… this part is not supposed to be here. Or here…\" \"Dr. Peterson…\" Sam interrupted. \"…Please.\" \"Please what?\" Dr. Peterson asked quite rudely. \"I'm only answering questions.\" He turned the ultrasound off and hung the transducer on the side of it. \"Now. We can do next in two different ways- I can get the equipment needed and take a sample of a tiny little, itsy, bitsy piece of your liver. Or you can go home now. And some medical secretary will call you up about a time for an appointment to do it. And you'll probably get that quite soon. But it's your choice.\" \"It's okay.\" I answered and was quite surprised at how weak my voice sounded. \"You can do it now.\" The quicker the better. The last few days felt like a million years. On Friday I had graduated, and gone home after going out with Nick and the others. Then had some blood tests taken. We had gotten the results that evening and then more on Monday. And here we were on Tuesday… My whole head was spinning around and around and for a moment I couldn't even think straight… Sam handed me some paper and I wiped off my stomach of the oil that was put to make the ultrasound pictures better. But still I was doing it almost without thinking. \"I'm not going to ask if you're okay.\" Sam said and patted my hand slightly. \"I know you're not… But…\" He looked towards the door, Dr. Peterson had gone to get his equipment. \"You know if you have any questions. Or you have anything you want to say… then don't hesitate. I'd rather hear you ask the same question ten times than one that you're carrying not being able to ask. Every question is alright- even if you have to wake me up in the middle of the night to ask… Okay?\" \"Okay…\" My voice was still sounding weirdly weak and almost as if I heard it from the other side of a wall. \"I don't… I know… I… What does this mean? Please… tell me this doesn't mean what I think it means.\" Sam didn't answer- but I could see the answer in his eyes. But I didn't even dare to think the word now. Still knowing both I and him and Dr. Peterson knew what this was already. Maybe I had known all along since Sam got that phone call on Friday. \"Dr. Peterson went to get some equipment it takes to take a test on the liver.\" Sam said at last. \"It means that you'll have to lie down on your side. He will give you some local anesthesia. It won't hurt but it's not going to be comfortable. While the anesthesia does it work he's going to stick a larger needle into your side, towards your liver. It will only take a few seconds, but while he does the test you need to hold your breath and lie absolutely still.\" Suddenly Dr. Peterson came back in the room, slammed down some things on a rolling metal table and then left the room again. Sam gave a sigh and sat down again. \"I know he can seem a bit cold and rude. Taking everything a bit too fast for your taste but… Dr. Peterson is one of the best doctor's around… I had my reasons when I made sure it would be him meeting you here today.\" \"You did?\" Sam shrugged with a slight smile. I should have known he had something to do with how fast this was going. \"I just want to figure what's wrong as soon as possible so we can help you and make sure it gets better.\" Sam said, but with a slightly ashamed look on him. \"I'm sorry… If there's anything going on too fast you can tell me. Okay? I'm just trying to make sure you're getting the best care possible but you know… Sometimes I end up helping a bit too much and I don't want to make anything bad for you. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" Just as I gave my okay Dr. Peterson came back into the room and sat down on his rolling chair while Sam showed me to turn over on my side. \"It's okay. I... I know nothing's going to get better by having long waits in between everything. Rather make it worse actually so… thanks.\" \"You're welcome.\" I had gotten needles before in my hands, arms and shoulders- the most common kind of needles really, but I'd never been afraid of them. This was a first to get first a needle into my side, and then the huge one I could see from where I laid at the same spot… End of flashback \"Now that's almost it Grace.\" I could hear one nurse's voice in the headphones I had gotten to shut out the noise of the MRI machine I was lying in. \"You've done very well. If you had moved we would have had to take new pictures but everything looks clear and good here. So there's only about twenty minutes left. And that is for your head, your brain. And for that you can get a mask that goes over your forehead and your chin to hold your head still. We can get you out of that machine, put it on and then you can be lead in again. Or we can just continue now if you promise to keep your head absolutely still.\" Twenty minutes felt like an eternity. But I just wanted this done and a mask didn't sound too comfortable. \"I can stay still.\" \"Great. I'll turn the radio on again now. Almost finished now.\" The radio in the headphones was turned again, but it didn't help much. BOOM! CRASH! BOOM! BURRRRRR Or the tries I made to shut the sounds out. I looked in the small mirror over me where I could see through the windows to the room where they controlled this machine. There sat two nurses by computers and Sam stood right behind them. Then just as I looked up Sam pointed to something at the computer screen. Now, that was it. Whatever he pointed on it must be bad. I could just as well go and lie down and die right away. He was pointing at something in my brain… This was definitely bad. \"And that's it.\" I hadn't even noticed that the radio in my ears had been turned off and so the MRI. \"Just lie still and we'll get you out.\" I could hear something happened and the gurney I laid on started moving out of the tube until I was all out again. Wow, sitting up knowing that was finished was a good feeling. I just wished I hadn't forced my mum to stay at work today. I had more or less forced her to stay back at the store. Told her that Sam could come with me and he was the doctor. That I didn't need her there. At last she had agreed on the one condition I'd come straight to the store when we were finished. \"Grace.\" Sam came in. \"Hey. It's okay.\" For a moment he sat down next to me and laid his arm around my shoulder. \"You have to breathe, now you're hyperventilating. Come on.\" He stood up again and I shook his arm off. \"Try to breathe now.\" He squeezed my shoulder a bit. \"That's it. Well done. But I know it's not so simple. Hey guys, we'll hear from you later… Let's go outside and away from this stupid hospital smell… Maybe that will help if something at all.\" I wasn't so sure I was meant to hear that last. But when I tried to concentrate on getting air into my lungs and then out again. Tears were burning in my eyes but I forced them away, knowing crying now wouldn't help and shook Sam's arm off when he tried to put it around my shoulders again. \"Sorry… I know… I'd like to just… don't touch..\" \"Whatever you need Grace.\" He told me calmly. \"Now let's get out of here.\" I let him lead me through the hallway through the x-ray corridor, into the stairs, through a cellar corridor where there were less people than there would have been if we had used the corridor from the entrance. We weren't talking but I was grateful Sam made it like this. \"Sam?\" I had one question I wanted to ask. I wanted an answer. But at the same time I didn't because I already knew it. I just needed it confirmed. And suddenly I heard myself calling out to ask Sam once and for all… \"Yes?\" \"I know you're saying you'll be telling me later when you know more and everything… but I'm not a child. I do understand when something's going on. And something is now.\" I swallowed and tried to fight the lump in my throat. \"There's only one question I have to ask…\" when I asked, once again my voice sounded weirdly weak and almost as if I heard it from the other side of a wall. \"I have cancer. Right?\" Sam didn't answer, but I could hear him sigh and saw him in the corner of my eye. I didn't dare look him in the eyes, I knew that would be enough for an answer. And that even before when I finally heard him take a deep breath in and answer me. \"Yes.\" Random fact I actually had fun trying to write about the sounds an MRI x-ray makes. I'm happy as long as I don't have to do it. But some of it was taken from my experiences from three and three and a half years ago when it was me . First when I did when I had a lump in my stomach (turned out to be harmless) or when I was diagnosed with Epilepsy and it had to be checked if I had a brain tumor. (I didn't) And let me tell you- MRI's are loud… and you can't wear glasses (well duh! You can't wear metal glasses in a giant magnet)… and it sucks.[Chapter 5] So… some more author's notes. I'm sorry but I just wanted to say to you there's another couple of stories, and another couple of oneshots finished. So soon, soon I'll have more time for this story and the others that will be left. I'm sorry it's been a while since I last updated. Something happened a couple of weeks ago… Well, actually my dear uncle died from prostate cancer. And it's hard. I'm not going to pretend it's not but somehow the world just kept on going and the clock went tic toc tic toc… Anyway. I have decided to add a character in this story that will be written in memory of my uncle. He'll have some similarities, and some changes of course to make him into his character. And… I hope this isn't a bad idea. I actually don't think my uncle would find this a bad idea- he sort of liked random ideas like that Anyway, my uncle's name was Svein. And the character will be Stevie or Steven. And the rest about him will turn out in the story. I'll probably write notes- either by the chapters or on my profile what things are similarities to my uncle and what is not. And well, at last before the chapter. Rest in peace. Here we go. \"The good news are…\" Dr. Pennington from the oncology apartment told me as he held up the pictures from my MRI. \"…We caught this early. Liver cancer is often without any symptoms and therefore spreads all over the place before we find it. Now we can see no indication of that this have spread anywhere. Which is the best news we could have hoped for. The tumor is here, which have caused that the blood can't flow through like it's supposed therefore. And therefore the jaundice at an early stage. You might not feel like it but you've been very lucky. If we couldn't have found this when we did it could have spread and be very hard to treat. Now we can and then you can have a long and healthy life.\" I sat with my elbow on the doctor's desk and my hand wrapped in my hair. I was taking in every word he said and I'd already known I had cancer for quite a few days. Still I could only understand pieces of it. At least Sam had come with me and he could tell me everything I'd missed piece by piece instead of all at once like this. \"We'll start with chemo soon. And for that you come to the oncology department on the third floor…\" The doctor pointed in the direction it was from his office. \"You should get a call from them later today or tomorrow and the appointment for that within a few days. I'll sort out more appointments. With chemo you usually come here, come for three or four days or so. And then let some time pass by to let the body heal. And then, as soon as you feel better it's time for the next round and then you're going to feel like shit again.\" Dr. Pennington made a pause and riffled in the papers he had lying on his desk. I had to move my elbow when I held it right onto a pile of sheets. When I leaned down I felt it was heavy and slow, like every second was an hour long. A week and a half ago I had held the speech as the top student of high school. And now I had cancer. High school felt like it must be a whole lifetime ago. \"Actually…\" I heard Sam interrupt and I was sort of grateful for that. \"There's a bit too much now. Maybe we could go now and I could inform Grace about what will happen at home. I can take a folder or three but I think I have everything in my memory.\" Dr. Pennington searched through the drawers in his desk and handed Sam some brochures about what would happen next. \"Thank you. Come on Grace. I think… Maybe it will feel better if you can take it easy for a moment and then I'll tell you everything you need to know but at a slower pace. Then your mum will also be there... If you want to of course. Thank you, Dr. Pennington.\" The doctor raised his hand in a wave but didn't say anything more while I and Sam left his office and continued back towards the back parking lot where Sam had left his car. \"I know this is a stupid question Grace. But are you okay? I had a feeling that if we stayed in there we'd come home and you wouldn't remember a thing about what he said anyway.\" \"Yeah…\" I was confused so I barely even knew what I should have said. \"I mean no. I wouldn't have. Thanks…. Oh dear… Maybe we don't have to do it straight away when we get home. I just… It's not going to change anything but I could just need a minute to breathe. And maybe then I could understand everything better… Also… If you don't mind. \"I'd like for my mum to be there too.\" \"Of course I don't mind. And even if we do start and you need a break then just say \"stop\" and we will. This is about you… unfortunately. But it is. And therefore you are the one that needs to be in charge over how everything happens. We're all here for you- I, Cassie, Nick and probably a whole lot of people that I won't mention by name… Noah for example. And Brandon, Tara and Lori.\" Brandon and Lori… \"I didn't get a change to talk to any of them. There's just been so much…\" \"Don't worry about that… Once again, this happens at your pace and nobody's going to blame you for doing anything too slowly. If you need help with anything then just ask… And I know I'm nagging about it. But I have a feeling that needs to be done.\" Sam silent at last when we got into his car. In fact, there wasn't a single word in between us on the way home. And neither during the time we got into Grey House and I went upstairs and into my room. Then at last, when I could hear mum coming home I slowly got up and with heavy steps came downstairs and into the kitchen where Sam and mum were already standing with each cup of coffee or tea, talking too quietly for me to hear about what. But what I could hear was that it was about me. \"Guys… Please… Don't walk on egg shells around me. I… I can take this okay? Whatever it is. And I'd rather know you're being honest with me than not knowing exactly what's going on because you're trying not to scare me.\" I stopped talking, I didn't want to hurt them or anything but it was just that I wouldn't be able to stand not knowing I was hurting them even more by trying to cover things up for my sake. \"Can you tell me… Can you tell us what's going to happen now? Did you hear anything else from the doctor's or you… Or should I hear anything from them?\" \"I'm not so sure who of us will be called when they've got news or need to call us to come. From one side, they know me so that might be the fastest way to do it. But considering you're not eighteen yet your mum is still your legal guardian. Even though you are seventeen and can take things and… I don't know… Anyway, what's going to happen now.\" Sam sat down and I next to him. \"As we already know cancer is a mean disease. And therefore we also have to fight it with even meaner medicines. Most people have heard about chemo and see in front of them how all hair falls out and you can't eat because you just throw up. But the side effects, as for any medicines can be very individual. Hair loss and an upset stomach are among the common ones yes. But… We don't have to worry about them now, before we even know if that's where we're going to be.\" As on a given signal, once he breathed for the first time in minutes Sam's cellphone started calling out loud. He sighed, pulled it up. Then straightened once he saw who it was calling. \"Dr. Pennington?\" He answered, for a second time I hoped he'd put it on a speaker phone but he didn't. \"Yes… Already? Yes… I understand. That sounds good… I'll tell them now… Dr. Pennington have already scheduled your first dosage of chemo… And he wants to start as soon as possible…\" Sam made a pause. \"He sort of scheduled your first visit for tomorrow.\" Tomorrow already? \"I guess…\" I shook my head and did my best to hold my head up high. \"…I guess it's good if we just do what the doctor orders.\" It took everything there was in me and my strength to say exactly what I said. I knew it was always the best to go with what doctors and nurses said. But at the same time this wasn't anything I wanted to do in a million years. That whole night I laid awake staring into the ceiling. I had to know what was coming tomorrow. Yet I didn't. I didn't have any control of what happened next and it scared me. Everything that sort of meant something was that about five in the morning mum tip- toed into my room. Without saying anything or touching me she sat down on my bedside, and with her by my side I finally managed to relax and drift off. I woke up three hours later, and she was still there. And she was still calm all through the morning while Sam seemed stressed over nothing and everything already before and after coming to the hospital. \"I haven't met her before but there was some nurse named Amber who would come to meet us up when we first come to the oncology department. Coop… Dr. Pennington will probably pay a visit. You will get an IV and it will go on for four hours. When we start chemo you always start light at first. So it's just tomorrow and then one week off and what you get might not give you any side effects at all. Did I… Is there anything else you're wondering about?\" I shook my head, barely I could feel that mum had kept her arm around my shoulders and while that was nice it felt as if I was in my own bubble cut off from the rest of the world. And it wasn't exactly made any better by the word \"oncology\" on the door that Sam opened for us and then an dark- skinned woman in nurse scrubs coming to meet us. \"Hello. You must be Grace. I'm Amber and I will lead you through this today. Come with me and I'll show you around.\" She spoke quickly and smiling all the time while she shook hands with also Sam and mum. \"Usually in hospitals there is one apartment for adults and old people, and another for children. For the oncology apartment here we have put them all in one place. Through this hallway is a whole lot of rooms of one or two beds, for you to go into if you want or need privacy. If you feel better or don't want to be alone then you can go out here, into the living room.\" She showed me onto a big, open space that seemed like a combination of a living room and a kitchen. A few people sat around it in big, soft arm chairs- all of these people seemed in their seventies. Except for maybe one guy who might be just a little bit younger. All of them were bald from their medicines and wearing different hats or beanies. The younger one was wearing a cowboy hat and looked at me with a smirk as if trying to be funny. I doubted I could have found a million cowboy hats or smirks or any other jokes funny right now. \"And here we go...\" Amber sent a glance to the small group of people in the lounge. But still, turning to go I could hear the man in the cowboy hat say something to his friends around him. \"It just breaks my heart whenever someone young comes around here.\" \"And if you want privacy.\" Amber pushed one of the doors in the hallway open. \"Then here's a double room. The bed closest to the door is yours and… Are you okay Tim?\" \"Eurgh.\" A boy about twenty or a bit older sat Indian style on the bed nearer the window. His elbow leaned against his knee and his bald head in his hand, in his hand a sick bag that looked quite filled up. Right now he seemed worn out and was half- covering his face… I couldn't help but think that that would be me very soon. \"Here.\" Sam had grabbed a clean sick bag from a hanger on the wall, then gave it to the boy while he took the used one- he was quite used to this I'd have to guess. From all his working at hospitals, but still grimaced slightly at the smell from the bag and closed it before he threw it in the trash. \"Thanks.\" The boy said weakly. \"You look like you're quite used to that… but you didn't have to.\" \"I'm a doctor. So even though not working right now I can still act like one.\" Sam came back to mum and me while I hung my jacket on some hooks right by the door. \"…I'm Dr. Radford… Or Sam if you prefer that. This is my soon- to- be- wife Cassie. And her daughter Grace.\" \"I'm Tim.\" The boy looked up and his eyes gazed over the three of us for a second before he looked down again. \"Talk to you later.\" He didn't seem much of a talker, or it might have been because he started heaving. Or it might have been because I was showed to get up on my bed while the nurse hung my IV bag onto a hook attached to the bed. \"Are you ready?\" Sam asked while mum hugged me with one arm from the side. \"We won't be starting this until you are… I can do that.\" He took the needle from the nurse's hands. \"If anyone asks. She did this. This needle is usually called a butterfly. We'll stick it into your hand…. But like I already said. We won't start until you're ready.\" I hesitated. I then realized I'd never be ready so I might as well get it over with as soon as possible. \"Ready!\" And here we go. More in the next chapter. It will probably be up soon after new year's. So merry Christmas and happy new year- or as I usually call it. God jul och gott nytt år. I noticed their names are very similar. But Dr. Pennington- who is an oncologist (a cancer doctor) is not the same person as Dr. Peterson who is a… liver doctor. I don't know what that's called haha. Anyway. Yeah, they're two different characters. Random fact My computer broke while writing this chapter and I was only lucky to managed to email this from that one so I could put it up in my mum's computer and keep on writing- anyway, it would have been up days ago if everything had worked out like I thought it would.[Chapter 6] Hello everyone. Happy new year. I hope everybody had great holidays and that you'll all like this chapter. Here comes the explanation for the story's title. Enjoy This chapter is told from Sam's point of view. But it changes towards the end of the chapter. \"Grace.\" Almost as soon as we came inside the door at Grey House after taking Grace to her first chemo Candelaria came up to us. Holding in her hands a candle. \"I have noticed something. I noticed you seem sad a lot. And sometimes when I feel sad mum says everything's dark when you get sad.\" Candelaria held up the candle to Grace. \"So we light a candle… And then, when I'm not so sad any more then we can blow the candle out. And when the candle's burning I know it's not so dark and that makes me feel just a little bit better. So I wanted to get a candle all for you, and I got it at her store…\" She pointed at my mum. \"…All for my own money.\" Grace took the candle slowly, Candelaria lowered her hands and smiled up brightly towards the older girl. How was she supposed to say no to this. \"I don't think it's that simple…\" Grace almost whispered and then looked down on the younger girl, the time seemed to stand still for a moment. \"But that's a clever idea. Maybe I should try it.\" She looked around. \"Maybe I should put it in my room.\" \"No. Don't put it there. Put it somewhere where people can see it. They don't have to know why it's lit but it looks nice. And there's a corner in the living room where the lamps just can't reach. That corner is really dark and a candle could light it up and…\" \"Candelaria.\" Candelaria's mum- Aurora suddenly turned up from her side. Then started talking to her- but in Spanish… I didn't know Spanish. \"Sí…\" Well I did know that one word that Candelaria said, yes. \"I… my mum thinks now when I've told you my idea I don't have to keep on babbling about it. So… I don't have to. But I gave you that candle now. And I know candles always makes me feel better. You know… Candle… Candelaria… My name means candle…\" Her mother said something else \"ya voy mami\" I still didn't know Spanish but with the annoyed tone in Candelaria's voice while she stomped away I could guess what it was about. I turned to Grace who was holding the candle in her hand, then we both just had to go into the living room glancing towards the corner Candelaria thought was dark. I had never thought about it but she was right- it was like no lamp's light reached into it to light up the small table that stood there. \"Huh.\" I just had to make a sound. \"Candelaria was right about that corner. Maybe she could have a point with that… candle in the dark- theory. Giving it a try won't hurt.\" \"I think I have the exact right candle holder for it.\" Cassie studied the pale blue, swirling pattern towards the white candle. \"I'll go get it. Wait here.\" \"Hello…\" Cassie wasn't the only one around here who could turn up out of the blue in this house. I jumped when suddenly George was right by me and greeted. \"Sorry. I didn't mean to make you jump. I just thought I*d let you know that while I was taking care of everything in the hotel today not much happened. Two boys left- those Englishmen. Nobody arrived, and that little girl is absolutely adorable… How are you Grace? Oh… Candelaria wouldn't tell me what she was doing with that candle.\" \"Here. Found it….\" Cassie was panting slightly when she came back, holding onto a black candle holder with thin metal bars twisting from the bottom and to the top. \"Does this look any good?\" Grace barely looked at it, but gave a nod and Cassie found a lighter that she took with her. \"Come on…\" Grace didn't seemed all too enthusiastic about everything. But she did follow her mum and then put the candle in the holder and lit it up. She showed us an obviously forced smile and then hesitated about what to do next. \"Well…\" Grace said at last. \"There's a candle in a dark tunnel… I mean a dark corner… Sounds poetic if nothing else… I'm really tired. I'm going to bed.\" \"Already?\" I didn't want to interfere with anything Grace or Cassie said right now. But still I was frozen… \"If I know today's happenings right…\" I started, just so it wouldn't be so quiet. \"The chemo has got its side effects despite you not getting the strongest and the most right away. And then of course. At the hospital are a lot of new impressions. Doctors and other staff and patients and then all of that new equipment… I can see that you're tired. So unless there's something you need or want first then I think you can and should go to bed.\" \"Not anything I can think of…\" Grace looked around as if waiting for me, Cassie or George to say something. \"How did it go while we were away today grandpa? Has someone trashed the place an partied all day…\" \"Oh yes. I barely had the time to sort everything out and clean the place before you three came home again.\" George smirked. \"Everything's fine. None of you worry about it. Oh… Just one thing…\" George now sounded careful. As if he said it too fast he would hurt someone. \"Brandon passed by here earlier today and was looking for you. I think he had the gift you were supposed to get on graduation day. I didn't tell him, he asked me where you were but… Well. He said he was free tomorrow so I'm guessing both he and Tara and Lori will come by…\" \"Tomorrow?\" \"Yep.\" Grace sighed slightly, but she probably wanted to do more even though she didn't want us to see it. Then before anything else she nodded and hugged her mum. \"It's okay… They're going to have to know sooner or later so might as well be sooner.\" Cassie POV In the evening, a few hours after Grace's first round of chemo I was still sitting in the living room. A few times I went upstairs to check on my daughter, but she was sleeping tightly. Just as I had been able to feel within me. Then at last, with a deep sigh I knew I couldn't sit here all night. That it would help neither myself, Grace nor anybody else during the day and I got up from where I sat and into the bathroom. When I came out and was about to go to bed I would have if I couldn't suddenly feel that there was someone else here. Somewhere closer than the guests, Grace and Sam. And when I looked into the living room George was standing there. Before I came closer and he sniveled I could feel to myself that he was crying so I took a tissue from the kitchen. \"George?\" I tried softly. \"Is there something I can do for you?\" He shook his head. \"I'm a part of a generation that never thought boys or men should show any feelings.\" I handed him the tissue and he sighed before he rose it to his face and wiped his cheeks. \"…But… sometimes he just has to anyway.\" George then cleared his throat but it didn't help much when new tears came rolling down his cheeks. I laid my arm around his back and then stood close… It seldom made anything better in fact. But sometimes it felt like it did… It didn't feel like that now. \"Is there really no way for me to change? I see what Grace is going through now and I just wish… I can feel with all of me that I want to be able to take it. So that I could have cancer, so that my own body could have turned against me… So that I could be here each and every day- even in the future. Until I wasn't anymore… I'm an old man. I'm supposed to be ill. I'm supposed to… I'm supposed to die.\" Just as well could he have stabbed me right in the heart. But I could too see his point of view. Everyone would know that was what it was like and it was heartbreaking when it didn't. But that wouldn't make it any less painful if George would be the first of us to pass away. \"People aren't supposed to die after their children… I never knew how people breathe after they do. Then I had to see the way it hurt Brandon, Lori and Jake to lose Jennifer. At the same time as it broke my heart but… I had to take care of them. Then had to watch it all over again when you, Grace, Brandon and Lori all lost Jake… And meanwhile- I'm still here. I'm still breathing. And now Grace might… she's ill and she might…\" I suppressed a sigh and forced my own tears back. I hadn't even dared to think about it even though I knew that George was way too correct. And no less during the silence that followed while both I and George watched the candle still burning slowly. \"Sorry. I didn't mean to say that. Of course she won't. Luckily they caught this early and Grace is young and strong and… She won't.\" It wasn't that simple and we both knew it… That didn't make it any easier. \"I guess I'll go home then. Goodnight Cassie. I'll see you tomorrow.\" He had left before I had the time to react. And how was I supposed to have a goodnight? During waken nights came the thoughts one didn't dare to think about. During day time it was so easy to shove them away with everything else that needed to be done. Then it ended with tossing back and forth all night when they couldn't be ignored. \"Have you slept at all tonight?\" Sam asked when we were on our way downstairs in the morning. \"I thought there was a lot tossing and turning on the other side but I was half asleep… Huh? That's strange\" Sam seemed confused while walking over to the otherwise dark corner where I and Grace had put the candle from Candelaria making sure it wasn't in the way for someone making their way in our out or through the room. \"Shouldn't the candle be burning out… It's exactly as high as when we put light on it yesterday.\" I glanced over it slightly. Of course, today was a regular day at Grey House and I had to go on like if it was another regular day for me too. Maybe I should close the hotel for just a few months… or until Grace was healthier or… \"Maybe something's wrong with it.\" I raised an eyebrow at him and realized I hadn't answered. \"What? It could happen.\" I just shrugged and then followed him into the kitchen. \"Can you make me some more of that tea that taste like coffee… oh. Hey Grace.\" My daughter stood leaned against the kitchen counter. She had a cup of tea in her hand but only stared down into it without drinking. \"Good morning.\" \"Are you already up?\" I had asked before I could stop myself. \"It's barely even light outside…\" She shrugged. \"Are you feeling alright?\" \"Yeah. I just went to bed early- very early so I woke up early too. And… I suppose I could use some getting ready until Brandon, Tara and Lori gets here.\" She poured out what was in her cup and then put it on the counter. \"But… We must tell them. I must tell them about…. You know…\" I could feel the way she suppressed a sigh and the empty, given up feeling that was filling her up. I had just always used to know what to say- but seeing my daughter like this and I was in a complete loss of words. Yet I must be feeling nothing to how Grace was right now… \"Tea that tastes like coffee?\" I asked at last when I remembered. \"Yeah, sure. Just a minute.\" Ya voy mami means I'm coming now mum. Candelaria have and will say a few things in Spanish if talking to her mum. Short sentences and words will be written like that, while if they say more then it will be written… And I'm going to put on Facebook and ask… How do you say \"XXX\" in Spanish? And then hope that whoever answer me actually do know Spanish. The description of the candle holder doesn't make any sense. A picture will be up on the Instagram \"Linneagbfanfiction\" Random fact I would have made things so much easier for myself if there was a guest who spoke Swedish or Norwegian or even Danish at the hotel… Why did I make someone speak Spanish? (Answer. I wanted to use a name that meant candle)[Chapter 7] This chapter is told from Grace's pov Guess what?! I finished another story. Actually two more stories but last night I finished \"Dancing in the rain\" which always had very long chapters to work on and I always felt a bit pressured to make that story as good as possible while the chapters took weeks to finish. I've had fun writing it but I still am so happy it's over. I also finished my O. C- fanfiction \"The little girl\" so that's nine stories left, among them two that will be finished soon. Pictures of everything in Grace's graduation gift is up on my Instagram \"Linneagbfanfiction\" I hadn't been downstairs and into the kitchen for many minutes before I went back to bed. Whether it was a side effect from the chemo or it was just from stress my head was pounding and the only thing that helped just slightly was to turn the lights off so it was dark in my room and then lie down and close my eyes. \"Grace?\" What felt like a second later someone was shaking my shoulder. \"Grace? Come on little sister. Why are you sleeping in broad daylight?\" \"What?\" I turned and looked up to Brandon who was standing right next to me, and then Tara and Lori right behind him. \"What are you doing here?\" I pushed myself up on my elbows and then my hands to push myself up towards the headboard. \"Well hello to you too.\" Brandon smirked and sat down on the side of my bed. \"We brought your graduating gift since we forgot all about it on graduation day. And it's almost noon so we thought you'd be awake by now.\" Well, maybe you would too after getting in your body what I just got… I shook my head, I would need a better (or not so rude) way to tell them about what was going on. Hopefully that wouldn't be today. But still Brandon was more concentrated on the big, purple trolley bag that Lori was holding. \"And yes, I and these two now can't wait anymore.\" He laid the bag in front of him and between him and me. \"We were going to give you this on graduation but there were still things to sort out. So now… open it…\" Opening the big part of the bag and not the side pockets or the front the first thing I saw was a grey denim- like backpack with another several side and front pockets. \"Well, look inside of it.\" I did open the backpack first and found four books of the titles \"Everything you need to know before college\", \"Grow the f*ck up\", \"college hacks\" and \"100 things everyone should know how to do\". And before anything else I gave \"Grow the f*ck up a quick riffle- well a book with that title and a picture of a teddy bear on the front ought to be interesting. Quietly, as if I did it too fast or loud it would all disappear and turn for the worst once again, I laid the books to the side and took a pack of different colored pens from the side pocket of the backpack. While I took it and then a pink, knitted blanket from the big bag I thanked and nodded as I should have. But clearer than them in front of me was the scenario on the inside of my eyelids about what I should say and how they would react to everything that was going on. \"It looks beautiful.\" I said about the pale pink blanket. And running one hand over the soft fabric I thought to myself that at least this one would come to good use whether I went to college or not. But before I had the time to say anything my brother had started again. \"So as you can see your gift from myself, Tara and Lori is a whole, big bag of things to bring with you for college. Because together we have thought out things that we thought were necessary and also asked some friends and…\" He picked up a small, yellow item from the bag. He handed it to me and I saw it was a small power bank for my phone. \"I wish those had been around when I went to school. And besides, we tried to find things that weren't too boring. Here.\" He obviously thought I'd been doing it too slowly and picked up a plastic cup with a straw. And while the cup was see- through a yellow flower was painted on it with my name in matching, yellow print. I guess yellow flowers would always remind me of my dad. And Tara, Brandon and Lori knew all about that. I breathed in and turned away from the bag, but I didn't have the time to speak this time neither… \"And here…\" Brandon looked down in the big bag again. \"I'm not going to pick them all up. But there is a lifetime supply of Oreos in here. But I don't know with you because I've never met anyone who loves Oreos as much as you do. They might last you only a week or so…\" I let my arms fall lax towards my sides and into my lap. There was something about saying that I'd have a lifetime supply… \"Brandon…\" When I interrupted my brother he did have a brain in his hands. Holding up two halves it was split in and made book support. \"…Lori… Tara… Look! There's something I have to tell you guys.\" Silently some of the most important people in my life looked frowning back at me, and brainstorming for the best way to say this I realized I just had to say it right out or I'd never get through this. \"I have cancer.\" Brandon had picked up something that had laid in the bag. Ironically enough one of an organ of the body but in the shape of a brain and not liver. It was split in half and could support books or paper sheets in between them. I waited for any of them to say anything and Brandon especially would have quite some fan at that book stand. \"So…\" I continued when the silence was to thick. \"I won't be going to college. Not this fall at least.\" Maybe not ever. \"No.\" Brandon threw the brain bookstand to his side and towards my bed. \"No, of course you don't have Cancer. You can't have cancer. You're young and you're going to college. You're…\" He held up the books and a box of Oreos. \"You're going to college.\" The silence returned and I just shook my head when he could just as well have punched me in the gut over and over… \"Not right now I am… But when… if I do ever go I'll have all of these things, they're not going anywhere. And the blanket and the cup and the Oreos I could use now and I think… Well. They're all great things and maybe if I can't use all of them right now thank you so much for all of them…\" A part of me wanted to break down and cry and beg them to stay by my side through all of this. That this maybe I wouldn't get through but especially not without my family by my side, people I had known and loved as long as I could remember. But I didn't, and second after second ticking by the silence in between us was ear- crushing in the way it had been after the night had died… \"Well…\" Tara seemed more hesitant than ever and dug in the back of the bag for something I hadn't spotted yet and picked out a photo frame I hadn't yet seen yet. That she turned and showed me the picture before I could take it. \"Happy graduation and early happy birthday Auntie Grace.\" The white frame held a black and white sonogram picture, as those usually looked with the blurry but obvious frame of a baby still inside… \"Oh Tara…\" I could feel my chin dropping. \"…I… Tara, are you pregnant?\" Well the answer was quite obvious wasn't it? It was also obvious that this was a moment when we should have been nothing but happy and smiling and hugging and nothing else. I'm so happy for you two But I just couldn't say it. Not even with the framed photo I could feel happy. How was I supposed to be happy and caring and everything that should have been for this photo and the still very slight bump visible under Tara's shirt when I might not even be here to see my little niece of nephew in real life. I shook my head making a failed attempt to shake those latest thoughts away… Then I looked down on the photo again and could feel my heart melting. How could I ever have known I would love anyone so much as I did in right that second. \"Well…\" Tara started again and she looked as in loss of words as I felt. \"…I'm four months into the pregnancy and keeping it secret to anyone so we could keep it for this gift hasn't been easy… Some women grow huge during their pregnancy and from a few weeks into it there is no way of hiding it so… It quite suited… anyway…\" Tara wrapped her fingers around Brandon's while holding the other palm on her belly. \"…It's a girl.\" I looked down on the photo again and once again it was as if my heart just melted and I felt the strongest, purest love… But no, I couldn't be happy. Not in the middle of all of this. I hoped I would be, I hoped I would even be there to see my niece apart from on a photo. But I didn't even know if I would be and for the first time that thought really struck me without giving me a chance to shake it off. And while I fought them away tears were closer than ever of knowing that I might not be here… Random fact An important person of my life told me she was pregnant like that a few years ago with putting the framed sonogram photo up and… well. That was how it happened and at first I just didn't know how to react and then I looked at the photo and here I didn't even know how to describe it but I promise you it felt as if my heart just melted. And I never knew how much I could love someone before I saw that photo.[Chapter 8] This chapter is told from Grace's pov Well, hello you guys. I didn't finish another story since updating this last, but I did write two oneshots, one glee and one Anne of Green Gables. And I've got one chapter left of one story and two chapters of another, so very soon I'll have more time for the stories that are left and then I hopefully won't be leaving stories for as long as I do now without updating. \"How can that candle still be burning?\" Standing in the living room and staring at the candle that Candelaria had put up I could see the small flame reaching up, burning as brightly now as it had ten days ago when she had put it up. \"I don't know.\" I shrugged towards Nick and his question, weird things did happen in this house and this whole town but this was something out of the normal. \"It's kind of beautiful though. Don't you think? It's like it's… burning, burning, burning even during the night when it's dark… Yeah, sorry… You were going to go see Noah, were you?\" Nick nodded. I suddenly felt such a gust of jealousy it could have knocked me right over. Nick was dressed, packed and on his way to go to New York to help Noah set his new place in New York ready and stay there for a week. It had been planned for so long that I was going to come too. Maybe I could have if it had been last week or next, in between rounds of chemo when it still was as \"light\" as it was with less risk of side effects than it would be in a few weeks. \"Don't tell Noah about this, okay?\" I asked Nick. \"I want to tell him myself, I'll call him… soon.\" I had been saying this ever since I had the diagnosis, then wanted to wait until after the first round of chemo, then until I'd started getting more side effects… Then I just had enough to think about without that one phone call I never would have expected I would have to make. \"Hey guys. Nick, are you ready to go?\" Mum and Sam came into the room, Sam to take Nick to the airport. And mum to take me to the hospital. Or at least she would in a while, we didn't have to go just quite yet. \"Well then, I'll see you in a week.\" Nick smiled at me. \"Try not to cause any trouble.\" Well, I already had cancer. What worse trouble could there be? \"I'll do my best.\" I said instead of say something I'd regret. \"But you know me…\" Nick smiled as if not sure if I was being funny or not. Then walked out into the hallway, grabbed his trunk and made his way outside. Sam stayed rubbing his hands together… \"I'll see you later. I'll come to the hospital.\" Not that I knew why. Hospitals were just as depressing for doctors as for everybody else. But whatever he wanted… I was just too into everything else to be able to protest. I suddenly thought back to the graduation day, when I had felt something was wrong for the first time because I got so dizzy. It was only a couple of weeks ago but it felt like it must be a lifetime. At then I had been looking forward to travelling to New York this day… \"I'll…\" I just felt I needed to say something. \"I'll go rest for a bit. I'll be in my room if you need me for anything.\" \"I won't… and you need all the rest you can get so that sounds good.\" Mum did have a way with smiling so that I- and everybody else would feel all calm and like everything was good in this world. But not even that helped right now, and I felt it already when I made my way up the stairs, then wrapped myself in the blanket that Tara, Brandon and Lori had gotten for me, hugging the pink blowfish hard to my chest. Like a little child almost believing that a stuffed animal could take everything away. \"Grace.\" It didn't feel like a second later when mum came upstairs and came to get me, I looked up and rubbed my eyes, I hadn't meant to fall asleep. \"It's time to go now.\" Couldn't I just have kept awake so time wouldn't have passed by so quickly? \"I made these.\" She held up a bag of ginger biscuits when I came down and into the car a few minutes later. \"They might help if you get nauseas. And the risk for that might be bigger now than the last time… but well. I guess you already know what will happen.\" I gave a small nod and buckled the seat belt. Looking down on the bag of cookies I felt less like eating than I ever had before… Not like talking either for that matter. And the silence was thick all until we were up at the ward and Amber the nurse came up to me. \"Hello Grace. If you want to be in your room you'll be in the same as the last time, or do you want to sit in the lounge this time?\" I looked down the hallway towards the lounge, there seemed to be only one person there right now. The same guy in the cowboy hat that I'd seen the last time I was here. \"I'd like to go into my room please.\" Amber nodded and showed me to follow her, I tiredly did and mumbled a thank you when she held the door open to me. \"Hey…\" \"Hi again.\" The same boy as I had met for the first chemo session sat at the exact same spot as he had then, thankfully looking brighter today. Or at least he wasn't throwing up- for the moment. \"I'm sorry, but I didn't catch your name the last time we met.\" \"Grace.\" \"I'm Tim. Timothy actually, but only my mum says that and only when I've done something I shouldn't have… Winter.\" \"Winter… what do you mean Winter?\" \"It's my name- my last name. Winter. Tim Winter.\" \"Grace Russell.\" \"And you?\" He looked up at my mam. \"What's your name?\" \"Cassie Nightingale.\" \"Oh my. That is such a cool name… If I were you I would just shout it out to everyone before anyone had the chance to ask. Nightingale… wow!\" Mum smirked and shook her head- sometimes I could just know what she was thinking. And she was by no means going to tell him her birth name. \"So here we go,\" Amber suddenly spoke from right by my other side than the one nearest Tim. \"Pushing the needle in now, it will just feel like a mosquito bite.\" I didn't move or say anything when I felt the thin, sharp object go through my skin. \"Die cancer, die.\" \"How many times do I need to tell you Ambs?\" I heard Tim from the other side of the room. \"That joke isn't funny for anyone over ten years old… And if you don't mind me asking… Is it the… the first time… or… did you relapse?\" \"First….\" \"Oh damn. Sucks! I relapsed, fourth time. Doctors tell me this will be the last time and I won't make it through. But so they did the last time and the time before that so I don't really trust them anymore.\" Tim gave a shrug, Amber on my other side was working out with the IV bag and setting it ready… I would have wanted to ask if this was something I would ever get used to. Tim, if anyone should know. But I didn't want to worry my mum more than what I already had so I just leaned back and looked towards the needle in my arm that was soon going to push medicine into my body. \"Tim is a patient who has been going in and out of here so many times none of us can count. And as you notice, talking about cancer to him isn't any harder than talking about the weather. Some people appreciate that, and some do not. If you don't then you can ask him to be quiet…\" \"Or even easier- shout at me to shut up or else…\" \"Timothy Winter in a nutshell…\" Smiling to herself and rolling her eyes she hung the IV bag on the pole by my bed and gave me a smile. \"You just press that red button if you need anything. Or do you need anything now?\" She grabbed a sick bag from a hanger on the wall and laid it on the bedside table. \"The medicines you get is still as light you might not feel it at all. But just in case.\" I gave a nod, wanted to ask mum to come up and sit next to me on the bed instead of on the chair next to it but it was like all words had just left my brain. Something that hadn't left my mum's brain though was that way she always knew everything. And without a word she stood up and crawled up on the bed, I moved a bit to the side so she'd get some space and then she laid her arms around my shoulders and I leaned my head against her shoulder. I would have expected Tim to start talking about something soon, he seemed like the person who could talk forever and ever. But when he didn't, I glanced across the room, and he sat there with a book opened on his lap… \"Harry Potter?\" I had questioned before I had the time to stop myself. But here has to be something else than disease and medicines wouldn't there? \"Have you read them?\" \"No.\" I shook my head. \"I've been thinking about it and I like reading but I never really got around to. I don't know why…\" \"You should…\" He gave a smile, then looked down on his book again when I turned my vision forward again and leaned my head back towards mum's shoulder. \"Hello you two.\" I was half asleep when a voice I recognized as Sam's reached through and I looked up. \"Are you doing alright?\" I nodded and stretched, mum stepped down from the bed… \"Do you want me to stay like that?\" I shook my head slightly and made myself more comfortable. \"Hey Sam. How did it go at the airport?\" \"Nick's on the plane and it lifted like it should. That's all we know for now- he'll call once he's got his feet on the ground again. How are things going over here? Tired?\" I nodded barely. I didn't have to tell them I hadn't slept for a second last night… But I just needed to be left alone for a single second so trying to act like I was more alert and feeling better than I already was and maybe I could… One part of me wanted for them to leave and leave me alone, another part of me wanted to wrap myself in my mum's arms and never ever let go… There was only one option that could do well for the both in front of me though… \"You should go down to the cafeteria and have some lunch… Only you two…\" I looked up at the IV pole that could be rolled… \"I'm not very hungry. But it's past lunch time and as far as I know, you two haven't gotten the chance to eat anything.\" \"If you feel like something else than staying in here we could go out into the lounge.\" Tim said, with a meaning look towards me, he'd probably explain it. \"They're great people! I'm on first name basis with several of them.\" \"I guess we could. Maybe in a bit….\" I said and realized he had done it to stay by my side and mum and Sam would have one reason less to worry. \"Who's the guy in the cowboy hat? I remember seeing him the last time I was here too. Does he always sit in that spot in the lounge? Does he always wear that cowboy hat?\" \"That's Stevie.\" Tim told me. \"He's been here in and out for years… Yes and yes. I don't really know what's up with that hat though. Except of course…\" Tim pulled his beanie of his own, bald head and stroke a hand over it. \"…Nicest haircut, isn't it?\" \"You two seems to have made friends…\" Mum said, as if I'd been six years old. \"…Maybe we can go then.\" I hadn't quite looked away from Tim, suddenly having realized that within maybe a month at the most my own dark, tresses would be long gone. \"Grace? Can we go or do you want me to stay?\" \"Go! And don't worry about me. And don't rush back. Promise me those two lasts, please?\" Mum leaned forward and kissed my forehead., but didn't answer verbally or promise me anything. \"You just have to call one of us if you need anything at all.\" \"I know.\" I held up my phone. \"I'll be fine. The nurse herself said I shouldn't feel anything yet. And I've got these if I do.\" I held up the bag of ginger biscuits. \"And if I know you right they will help… Now go. Have a date…. Or well, something close to it. Life is what you make of it isn't it?\" Sam smiled as if mischievous and laid his hand on mum's shoulder. Mum was still hesitating but I gave her a meaning look and then finally backed towards the door. Barely had they left the room until I suddenly felt my stomach twisting, and with a hand on it I bent over in pain, panting. When I looked up, I could see Tim had dropped his book and was watching me… \"What?\" I couldn't help but wonder. \"What is it? It stopped now anyway…\" As if it was talking itself that did it my stomach twisted again, even harder and harder. Before I even knew about it I couldn't help but feel the heaves pushing up my throat and I quickly reached for the sick bag. Again and again, so fast I didn't get the time to catch my breath one heave after the other ran through my body… I closed my eyes. Vomiting was bad enough, seeing what came up of what I'd eaten mixed with sour bile was the worst of all. I could feel someone taking the bag from my hand and then barely knew that he or she put a new, clean one to replace it… \"Grace…\" I heard a voice, but it was far away and as if I heard it from the other side on a wall. \"…Grace? Can you hear me? Can you try and take a breath, okay? It's gonna be alright, it's gonna stop. Just try to relax and take a breath…\" Relax and take a breath, that was easier said than done. And all of a sudden everything was spinning. It felt as if I was tumbling around and still vomiting I could feel it staining my shirt barely knowing what was going on or what I'd do about it. I could feel myself collapsing flat on my side towards the sheets and heard an alarm going off. Then all of a sudden, everything turned black… Random fact When she starts being in pain, from the start Tim was going to ask if she was okay. But the answer's quite obvious so I made him not do it. Then I couldn't come up with anything else and he didn't say anything else.[Chapter 9] Thanks to baru11 for reviewing. Some months ago I had a number of stories that were almost finished. Last week I finished the last two of them- break broke broken trust and how far I'll go. I also wrote another oneshot, this one for Degrassi and called go round and round. So now, with all of those finished I finally do have more time for the stories left. And hopefully it won't take months in between every update. \"Grace?\" All of a sudden a voice reached through the dark. \"Grace… can you hear me?\" Briefly, as if in another world I felt something touch my hand… or was it my arm or my wrist. \"Mhm…\" \"That's it Grace. Try to come back to us now.\" I moaned and forced my eyelids open, one by one feeling the sour taste in her mouth of vomit, something sticky around her mouth, on her face, in her hair and everywhere. \"Mhm.\" I moaned again and could barely open my eyes before they heavily fell closed again. \"Wha' abe?\" \"Don't mind about that. Here, sit up.\" The nurse who sat right next to me laid her hand on my back and helped me sit up, then handed me a glass of water. \"Drink this. It'll make you feel better.\" My head was pounding and when I took the glass it span so bad I almost dropped it and had to lower my hand to lean the glass against the mattress I sat on and close my eyes. \"Try to stay with us now, Grace.\" I heard the nurse's voice. \"Only so we can change the sheets.\" I forced my eyes open and then looked around me and on the sheets stained with vomit, then looked down and wanted to find something to say that wouldn't make this quite as embarrassing. And right then the door to the room flew open and mum came rushing in with Sam right behind her. \"What happened?\" I shrugged and then carefully and shakily lifted the water glass to my mouth. The nurse was correct… well. Almost. It didn't take away the headache and it didn't make me wake up from whatever half- unconscious state I was in. But it felt clean somehow and it washed away some of the sticky, sour taste in my mouth. \"What happened?\" Now both I, mum and Sam had asked and the nurses still hadn't given us an answer. \"Tim was here too. And he can explain this just as well as we can, now please stand up so we can change the sheets into ones that haven't been puked on.\" And nope. The nurse's voice didn't make the pounding in my head any better either. But she was only doing her job and I carefully turned, put my feet towards the floor and shakily and weakly stood up while mum hurried to me and supported me from the side. \"It's okay…\" I closed my eyes when I leaned my head against her shoulder before she tried to lead me to a chair. If I sat down there was no way I'd be able to get up and into bed again. \"But yeah… Tim? What did happen?\" I opened my eyes slightly and glanced to the bald boy across the room. He had to hesitate and seemed insecure for the first time since I had known him. \"It was kind of scary, really. I've seen most things that goes on in this place. But she was alright and then she started throwing up and then she just collapsed.\" I couldn't help but to let hear a small whimper across my throat. What was this? Only a few weeks ago I had been the health itself and now I was here and a boy who had never been and maybe would never get the chance was describing to me exactly what had happened when my unhealth had showed clearer than ever. \"Tim! Don't scare her.\" \"I'm sorry. But you gave me a question and I gave you a truthful answer. I hope you'll feel better soon now Grace.\" I could just get up on the bed again and lay down my head. It didn't stop the pounding, but it made it less… heavy in a sort of way. \"Chemo sucks.\" \"It sure does!\" I had to agree. \"I could never have imagined exactly how much.\" Tim suddenly looked weird, as if he was hesitating about what to say next. \"I was never given the chance of imagining exactly how much.\" I looked up towards the IV bag hanging by my bed, filled with fluid that would make me Christ knows how ill before it was empty. It was my second- but how many had Tim experienced during the times he had cancer and then relapsed and relapsed again? \"I'm so sorry.\" Was the only thing I could think of to say. \"It's so… it's just so sad that you… and some people don't even get a childhood.\" \"Sorry?\" Tim obviously didn't agree with me. \"I had a quite alright childhood actually. I always got a lot more attention than my twin sister Sam. We were sort of the twins from hell and played mischief everywhere we went and no one would ever suspect it was us. I just played the cancer- card and she was… pretended to be the nice, well- behaved girl… Which she was as long as I wasn't anywhere to be seen.\" He smirked. \"And I have no trouble with calling it playing the cancer- card because damn! That's exactly what I did. And then I had another sister, Sophie. And then another one, and when the other one was born I had just relapsed for… I think that was the second… yes it was the second time. And then… I almost died. It looked really bad. And my mum and dad asked if there was one single last thing I wanted and I told them… I told them I'd like to name my sister Faith. And that way, even if she couldn't know me like Sam or Sophie could- she'd always have a piece of me. And as for Faith, and Hope and… well Grace of course. Those are important and I decided that Faith made the nicest name…\" Tim pulled up his phone, scrolled on it, then stood up and came and showed me a photo of him and three girls, obviously his sisters. And all standing right next to him, in the works of happily and jokingly shaving his hair off. \"That's the latest time I relapsed… Right after this photo was taken we shaved all hair of their heads too. I swear to you I have never laughed so much in my life… Life's what you make it. Right? Well I'm sure as hell not going to make it any more boring than what it has to be.\" My head was still pounding as bad as ever, but something in how Tim was talking to me eased on the feeling of everything falling to pieces. \"My point is, I lived, I laughed, I... didn't cry so much. I was furious, I played and did… well, most of my homework… And all along I knew better than most others how quickly life can change. How quickly it could all change. How soon it could all be over. I had quite an alright childhood if you ask me. And I'm now fighting cancer for the fifth time…. I promise you, I'm not going to give in and leave this place before I'm at least a hundred years old.\" \"And if anyone at all can make that...\" Nurse Amber, whom I had met earlier when I came here had come into the room. \"…It's Tim Winter. And that's a fact! Is there anything I can get you honey? You do look very pale. But then… well, you know.\" Can I get something for the headache? The simple question I could ask was on my tongue, but I just couldn't get around to speak it out loud. \"You do get that look in your eyes Grace.\" Mum sat down on the edge of the bed and stroke the fringe away from my forehead. \"The one when you're in pain but don't want to show it… It's okay. Where does it hurt?\" I knew there was no certain look in my eyes, mum could feel what I felt just as I felt a gust of her worry inside of me. \"My head.\" I managed to squeak out at last. \"I have a headache.\" \"I'll get an aspirin for you.\" Nurse Amber said with a smile. \"I'll be back in a second.\" I tried to show mum a slight smile, but I couldn't even force the smallest one. It seemed far away. And even further away when today's dose of chemo was done and Tim was leaving just as nurse Amber was pulling a needle out of my hand. \"We think it would be for the best if you stay here overnight. Just tonight. This round of chemo is for today, tomorrow and the next day. So if nothing happens tomorrow you can go home and then come back for the last. But… just in case.\" My stomach clenched and I would have liked to scream and cry and shout at her, at all of this and refuse to stay where I already sat. \"I have to go and sort out some guests and rooms on Grey House. But I can come back when I'm finished. It will only take a little while. And I can pack some things in your bag as well. I'll do that anyhow. You could need your phone charger I guess, and maybe something to wear when you go home instead of that hospital gown. Is there anything else you want me to get?\" The pink blowfish was the first thing I could think of. To just have something- someone to hold tight during one night that would most likely be the loneliest of my whole life, the first few ones after my dad died included. I hadn't been quite as lonely then though. I and mum hadn't gone back to sleeping in our own beds for weeks afterwards… \"No. Just take what you think will come in handy.\" Mum pushed her hand over my forehead. A move that I knew was meant to feel if I had a temperature. I wondered how many times she had done this when I was little and how many parents out there who did the same pretending it was only a move for comfort. \"I might as well get up.\" On stiff and shaky legs I stood up. \"Tim's not here anymore but… sitting back in this room and sulking won't do any good for me and not for anybody else for that matter.\" Mum nodded agreeing. It wouldn't make me any healthier. It wouldn't have taken away the cancer. The hallway and lounge was empty except for one person when I walked down the hallway and looked around. In a chair nearest the window sat the man I had seen before wearing a cowboy hat. Steven or whatever his name had been. \"Well hello young lady.\" I jumped when I had walked over to the window and looked outside and then he started talking to me- I thought he was asleep. \"I would say it's nice to meet you but it's not nice being in a place like this so why would I? I'm Steven Wembley by the way. But everyone calls me Stevie.\" He took his cowboy hat off, revealing a head as bald as Tim's and nodded slightly. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd be just as bald in a few weeks. \"Grace Russell.\" Stevie put his hat back on, then watched me for a few seconds in a way that made me uncomfortable. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare at you like that. It's just that… It breaks my heart when new people come here. Especially when it's young people. I'm sixty two if you're wondering but I don't think you are… How old are you, if I may ask?\" \"Seventeen.\" Stevie gave a sad kind of smile, with his head leaned back against the next support of the chair he sat on he turned away from me and I almost thought he'd fallen asleep before he opened his eyes and then smiled childishly and hit his hands towards the edges of the arm supports as if a move to show that he wasn't going to stay sitting for much longer. \"Time to get to work then, dinner time. Did you know I make the best meals around? I was never a good cook before, but then I… I wanted to help people here so I started using things like ginger, oregano, garlic. All of those things from the nature's own pharmacy, while also the staff here wants you to eat as much fat as possible so butter, cream, oil… Chicken's on the menu today. Maybe you would like some too? Hungry?\" The mention only of food, and those fatty things made my stomach ache, but at least I didn't feel as nauseas as I had done earlier. And while I felt better I still hadn't eaten since… Well, when was it actually? \"Some of us feel a bit better after eating.\" Stevie told me. \"With only a few bites or however much you can get down… Well, at least that's saved me from that horrendous dry heaving I don't know how many times.\" I leaned back in the chair and watched Stevie as he took spices out of a cupboard, chicken files and garlic out of the fridge and then some. I couldn't help but to quite enjoy myself only watching him. It all just seemed so normal only meters away from IV poles and hospital rooms. He must be right though. Maybe it could make me feel better (and save me from dry heaving if I got sick again) if something except for empty and bile in my stomach. Well, chemo sucked, so did this hospital and cancer over-all. But to quote a certain friend of mine- I wouldn't have to make this any more boring than what it would have to be. \"Yeah. Why not?\" Random fact I mentioned this before I think but the character of Stevie was made up and planned right after my uncle Svein passed away from prostate cancer. Several things will be based on Svein, the name, the age, the cancer. At least some of the personality. And I first wasn't going to tell my mum about it because I was afraid she wouldn't like it. But I did and she told me that this was an idea that my uncle would have really liked. Although… she said that Svein wouldn't have taken on a cowboy hat for anything in his life. That was all my idea.[Chapter 10] \"This is good actually.\" By the time Stevie had finished dinner most others who had been here during the day had left to go home for the night. He had also taken some plates of the oregano chicken he'd made into people's own room and around the big table in the lounge were me and him, nurse Amber and a doctor I couldn't remember the name of. \"Nature has its own kind of pharmacy… Oregano counts too… I've been cooking different kinds of food with different kinds of goods from that pharmacy and every time I say this is the best. And every time I seem to impress myself.\" \"You're impressing me too.\" Nurse Amber said. \"We're always hoping we'll get to work the shifts when Stevie Wembley is cooking dinner.\" I nodded slightly, what Stevie had made of the chicken and oregano reminded me of whatever mum would make with all of what he called the pharmacy of the nature itself. It did taste good just at the nurses were saying. But still, every bite was harder to get down than I had ever experienced anything being before. \"I can see the look on your face Grace.\" Stevie said all of a sudden. \"You don't have to eat it all. I know what you're feeling like.\" I might not have felt as nauseas and knocked out as I did earlier today. And I couldn't exactly like the fact that my mum and stepdad had gone for the evening and night. Of course, they hadn't wanted to- I had talked them into it. And. Unless something happened during the night that they I'd need my mum for it they'd come back in the morning. Leaving the table I walked over to the window in the bottom of the hallway. There was one parking lot outside the room I and Tim had been, another one for the staff of the hospital here. And then one building I couldn't recognize right over. Where a young boy- around my age stood looking back at me. \"That's my son. Do we look alike at a lot you think?\" I never could have said they looked alike, even from here I could see the boy in the window had a darker skin color than Stevie- to say the least. \"I know you can see it…\" Stevie chuckled. \"…I never married you know. But I did adopt Aaron and two other children and two other children and I had a farm and I made a pretty good life. Now, Aaron is adopted from Somalia. What you can see right over here is the patient hotel where sometimes patients or their families goes to stay when we can't leave the hospital. And when I'm spending the night here they're always staying here at least one of them… Sometimes I go to see them there or in the restaurant… Sometimes we send a couple of text to each other and then we just stand here and grimace at each other. And then compete at who can make the worst grimace.\" \"Steven Wembley. What have we told you about scaring these new people away with all your grimaces?\" Stevie looked back at the nurse and then stuck his tongue out at her. There was something in me that wanted to laugh. While something still kept me from doing it when Stevie raised his hand in a wave towards his son and then went to sit down in a chair by the window. \"Well. I have three children. None of them are biologically mine. But the boys I had since they were so little I was able to give them their names. And the girl I had since… I think she was one when I went to wrap her in my arms and take her with me from that awful children's home.\" Stevie grimaced at me to show what he thought about the place he first had met his daughter on. I didn't know what to say and did not have the time to figure anything before Stevie had pulled up his phone and gotten up a photo of his three children. \"There's Aaron. He's thirty, then it's Piti, from Thailand. And then, once they were teenagers I was sort of longing for a baby again and there was Seth from Nigeria… Seth isn't so much older than you… He's been single for a while.\" Stevie smirked and put his phone back into his pocket. \"And you know… anywhere in this world I could have decided to search for adoption and yet I ended up with the best ones…. But Seth is…. A personality… I think maybe you'd like him.\" Maybe an exactly as big personality as Stevie himself was. \"I have a boyfriend, sorry.\" As soon as I mentioned it I remembered I still hadn't told anything of this to Noah. I had even asked Nick not to tell him. I wasn't so sure what to say or where that sorry came from. I was happy with Noah. Even though Stevie maybe seemed I would be happier with someone else. \"Don't say you're sorry.\" He smirked at me. \"I know how all of this seems. I just… When I get here it's nice if someone thinks and talks about something else than cancer. Or medicines or my Gosh those side effects… Sometimes it's just easier to talk about that homework is such a pain in the butt or damn it my whole yard smells terrible. I wish there was a way to get away from it.\" At that moment I knew exactly what Stevie meant and somehow I could feel a small smile form on my lips. Even though, from Stevie it seemed to be gone for today. \"Cancer sucks… Is this your first round of chemo?\" \"Second.\" Stevie looked at me and that's where he kept his vision for long enough to make me uncomfortable. As if to get away from it I pulled my arms into my sleeves and hugged myself before I could see in the corner of my eye how he leaned his head back against the neck support \"I was going through it and I know at least some others do it at the very start, when you just found out you have an illness like cancer. Or going through the type of chemo or whatever medicines you get- from the beginning you just don't feel like it's real. It's like something in you doesn't want it to be…\" I gave a few silent nods. Stevie put words on something that I couldn't help but feeling. \"But then of course. We don't get away from it no matter how we try why we're here. And the more we know about each other and whatever we're going through. The easier it is to help. I hope you don't mind me asking. What kind of cancer have you got?\" I hesitated for one second, it had only been so real for a while. Even more real than it had ever been before. I knew the answer very well but I couldn't get it out. \"Ehrm…\" \"Maybe if it's easier for you to say it if I say mine first. It is for some people. But I can give you a promise that you cannot get the same kind of cancer of you do so I guess you're safe. No pressure of telling me but I just know what people around here are like. I also have prostate cancer.\" I hesitated for another second before I answered in one single word. \"Liver.\" \"Oh damn. That sucks!\" I couldn't help but to pull for my breath at those comments. Those were the ones that made this all so real. While Sam, mum, Nick and George seemed to be walking on eggshells around me I knew very well I might not get out of this alive. \"Grace.\" Stevie interrupted my thoughts and I got a feeling he knew exactly what I was thinking. \"I'm sorry for that! But you're young, and… well. You still have all your hair left so I'm going to take a guess that you just started this?\" I nodded. \"No worries are worth taking out before we even know what's going to happen. And even then it simple isn't worth worrying. Look at me for example. I have prostate cancer in my whole damn body. And do you know exactly how much that sucks?\" I couldn't help but a small chuckle- the first ones in weeks escaping me. \"Now, that's better… But promise me one thing. That no matter how bad this gets- you won't give up. Promise me that?\" I wanted to answer him that I wasn't going to. I wanted to answer that no matter what I would be okay. But there was that voice in the back of my head that I had tried to shove away all I could and… I could feel my mum coming up behind me before she had made one single noise. \"Hello Grace.\" She said as she sat on the arm support of the chair I sat in. \"And hello Mr. Wembley.\" \"Just call me Stevie. Please, everyone does.\" Both mum and Stevie gave each nod and I suddenly thought that my mum still hadn't told Stevie about who she was as she usually did first time ever meeting someone right away. \"Well, Stevie. This is my mum.\" \"Hold on…\" Stevie pointed to my mum. \"Isn't you that one in town? I think my daughter went to yours with those terrible period pains she had and never heard about them again… Thank you so much!\" \"That could be me.\" Mum nodded. \"And… Piti Wembley, I don't think it was only period pains but headaches and tense muscles in her neck and shoulders from stress and… she just put a lot of pressure on herself.\" \"Now…\" Stevie suddenly sat up straight and turned grey. \"…I think you'll have to excuse me.\" \"Do you need a sick bag?\" I heard from the lounge around us while Stevie more or less flew to his side. \"Nope. Other side.\" He half jumped half ran down the hallway and luckily he was in one of the rooms closest to the lounge. The nurse that had asked him if he needed a sick bag sort of grimaced towards us. \"Well, one can't say he's too shy with his problems.\" She rolled her eyes and continued with her job with checking on every patient down the hallway while I turned to my mum. \"You came back.\" It sounded more happily and relieved than I had meant it to. Now mum wouldn't ever leave me alone for this no matter what I thought or wanted about. \"Thank you for coming back.\" \"I'll put up the sheets of the second bed in your room Miss Russell. That way you can both stay here all night, both of you in a soft bed instead of a hard stretcher.\" \"It just didn't feel right leaving you here on your own. And Sam agreed with me anyway. He and George will take care of Grey House for the night. And for other nights… If you think I should then… maybe I should close it down until you're better. \"No.\" I sat up straight and looked straight into her eyes. \"No. That's the last thing I would want you to do. I know how much it means to you and every room is booked for months forward… You can't close it even for one night. Let alone until I… feel better.\" It was a bit hard to understand or even believe I ever would. And I quickly I brainstormed for another idea than to shut off what mum loved as much as to run Grey House. And then the idea just came to me. Just there as if I had planned it all from the beginning. \"I can write a letter. I can write a letting that we put on the door or in the reception on grey house. That way people will know what's going on. And they will know it's not contagious… I guess that's the most important part. If they don't want any sickness around then they can just go to another hotel or BnB… \"Actually.\" I'd like Tim or Stevie here- they would have known what to say. \"That's not a bad idea.\" \"I have a notebook and a pencil in my bag.\" I got up from the chair and stumbled a bit. \"Whoa… no. I'm okay, I'm okay. I just stood up a bit too quickly.\" We made our way down the hallway and to the room I had earlier shared room with Tim, now the nurse was just putting on new sheets on the bed for my mum to stay. I grabbed the notebook and pencil from my bag and scrabbled down a letter Hello everyone who comes to stay at Grey House. My name is Grace Russell, I'm the daughter of Cassie Nightingale and I live here. So it's a promise more than likely that you will see me while staying here. I just wanted to let you know that I have a type of cancer, in my liver. I'll be out and in the hospital some days so you won't be at risk of being bothered at all. Other days I will be home and getting sick. Or needing peace and quiet after getting heavy kinds of medicines. If you have any questions then you're free to ask any one of us. I and mum are usually around. But also George, Sam or Nick are here most of the time and will be able to answer your questions. We're hoping that if something while I'm sick, that you can please respect the wishes we might have to make. Other than that I hope you'll have good stay here at Grey House. Sincerely Grace \"Is this good?\" I handed the sheet of paper to mum and pulled my quilt around me and laid down while mum read through the letter several times. \"I really don't want you to have to close grey house… not because of me.\" \"Grace.\" Mum pulled a hand through my hair as if to feel if I was ill. \"Don't think anything like that. You mean so much to me and that is so much more than Grey House or the store or any costumer… I'll put this note at by the entrance. But if you want me to close it down- for some time or for just one night. Then please, don't hesitate to tell me.\" I didn't even mind answering, we both knew I wouldn't tell her or anyone else no matter how bad I felt. \"Are you two going to bed already?\" The nurse came into the room once I couldn't keep my eyes open. \"Well… a lot has happened so I guess if you're tired. Anyway. You know where we are if you need anything. Goodnight.\" I didn't mind answering my mum or the nurse. They both knew I would pretend I was fine even through the worst of days. But I could always hope and the last thing I thought was for this today to turn into a better tomorrow. Stevie's children- whereas only one actually takes play in this chapter. Are Aaron, portrayed by Corbin Blue, Piti portrayed by Brenda Song and Seth portrayed by Deji Olatunji More about Stevie's children will come up later in the story and I really hope none of it will seem racist… And yeah, that's about all I have to say now. Random fact I can never remember what is a pencil or a pen. Because in Swedish both are called Penna. Tuschpenna/ bläckpenna/ blyertspenna and so on.

The House Of El In the darkness of inner space, ArgonCity stands in an almost crystal like dome surrounded by 4 powernpanes. But there is something different about the gleaming energynbeing emitted by the panels, it now lacks the strong glimmer andnflashes of light that once radiated from the power mills of the city.nWhile the remaining scientists tried to find other ways and means ofnkeeping the city alive by adding power sources, Zor-El and Alura arenpreparing their only daughter Kara to deal with the prophecy that thenelder sorcerer Zaltar had secretly entrusted to them before henbanished himself to the Phantom Zone. The extent of this prophecynwould have a life changing effect on Kara and the future of the citynsome of the residents called New Krypton. ********* ThenHall of Learning was the largest room in all of Argo City. Here, thenhistory of Krypton and its people were kept in ancient crystalnscrolls that they managed to escape with when their home planet ofnKrypton exploded. Although Jor-El had managed to store most of thencrystals in his son Kal-el's spaceship when he was jettisoned tonEarth, Zor-El collected those which were left behind and took it withnhim when Argo City detached from Krypton. Zor-El and Kara were nownhuddled over the crystals, carefully studying the contents of eachnone before placing it inside special blue and red boxes carrying thenS emblem. The room had been sealed off from the rest of thenpopulation ever since the Omegahedron began showing diminished powernoutput. Only the members of the House of El --- Zor-El, Alura, andnKara, were allowed to enter the hall ever since. \"Father,nwhy do we have to pack all of the record crystals? Do the elders knownwe are doing this?\" she asked as she sealed another container ofncrystals and carried it to the other boxes now lining the hall. \"Ofncourse they know my child. Do you think we would be doing thisnwithout their approval?\" \"Injust find it strange that they would ask us to do this under suchnsecrecy. They even have me attending special classes about Kryptoniannhistory and science, I have taken so much notes in class that I feelnlike they want to turn me into a historian.\" Zor-Elnlooked up from the crystals laid out before him. He ran his handsnthrough his daughter's hair with a visible sadness on his face. \"She is too young.nThis should not be happening to her.\" he thought to himself. \"Just rememberneverything that you are being taught is your family history,nyour heritage. You have to keep it alive within you.\" Atnthat moment, the heavy sliding door covering the entrace opened tonreveal Alura carrying a tray of food and refreshments for her family. \"Time for a breaknZor-El. Kara, put those crystals down and wash up. I brought some wetntowels for both of you.\" she found a clear spot on the tablenthat practically spanned the whole room and put down the tray. \"Finally! I amnfamished!\" Kara put the crystal she was holding into a holdernthen joined her mother at the end of the table. Zor-Elnseemed absent minded as the family shared the meal. He wasnpre-occupied with thoughts of how to best break the news of thenprophecy to Kara. It had been over a year since Kara last went tonEarth and it was probably much different from what she remembered. Henwould have to send her back there soon. He could only hope thatnsending her back after so long would prove to be the right thing tondo in the end. Sensing her husband's troubled thoughts, Aluransignaled for him to join her at the boxes. Pretending to read the boxntags, he asked her if she had heard anything more from thentechnicians at the power center. \"Itndoes not look good Zor-El. They don't know how much longer they cannkeep it stable.\" Henlooked away from the boxes, glancing in the direction of hisndaughter. \"I wouldndo anything for Zaltar's prediction not to come true.\" \"Younknow there is no way to stop it. Zaltar paid for his mistake with hisnlife. It is unfortunate that we must all be involved in thenrepercussions of his actions. I just pray that he is wrong. That mostnof us shall survive and can join Kara when she departs from here.\" Zaltar's prophecy wasnknown only to Alura, Zor-El, and the ranking elders of Argo city. Hisnprediction was that due to the loss of the Omegahedron, an evil forcenshall come to possess the power ball and deplete its powers on manynoccasions. These events came to be true since Kara had previouslyndone battle with the sorceress Selena on 2 occasions, the last onencosting Selena her life. The prophecy stated that at the endnof the life cycle of the orb, all of Argo City shall be destroyed,nthe sole survivor of the catastrophe shall come from the House Of El.nA prophecy that Alura and Zor-El took to mean that only Kara shallnsurvive. The exposurento black magic caused the once solely white magic possessed sphere tonmalfunction on many occasions since then. It had taken the fullncooperation of the elders and vast amounts of white magic to bringnthe ball of power under control. Each time the ball malfunctioned,nits power drained at an alarming rate. Argo City was a place livingnon borrowed time. It was only the capability of the elders to projectnand control illusions that prevented everyone else, including Karanfrom actually seeing the truth. Argo was a dying city and the timenwould come when the Omegahedron would finally destroy the city itnonce gave life to. \"Wenwill have to tell her sometime Zor-El. We need to prepare her.\"nAlura reminded her husband who was now busy realinging some boxes. \"Mother, father,ncome and eat with me.\" Kara signaled for her parents to join hernat the table. \"SoonnAlura. The time will eventually come. In the meantime, let ourndaughter remain innocent for as long as she can.\" he took hisnwife's hand and kissed it as he led her back to the table. ********** Havingnretired to their family quarters for a night's rest, Kara was nownalone with her thoughts as she sat on the corner of her bed with anbox open before her. Before her were the mementos of her last visitnto Earth. She smiled as she held up the blouse of her Frostee'snunform. She remembered how Lucy Lane had helped her get the job andntaught her how to cook hamburgers and fries. Jimmy Olsen had givennher an old camera of his to take back with her to Argo City when henfound out she was leaving. She never did get to use the camera. Therenwas no need for such things on Argo City. The moving images of peoplenwere stored on the crystal sticks and viewed as wall projectionsnwhenever one wanted to. Kal-El had given her the communicator wandnher father had used to contact him. All of these brought backnwonderful memories of the people she had once called her friends onnEarth. However, there was one bittersweet item in the box that alwaysnbrought her near tears when she looked at it. ********** Jimmynhad taken a few pictures of her in the guise of Kara being held closenby Ethan while they enjoyed a boat ride during the picnic in the parkna day or so before Kara left for her home planet. Staring at thenpicture, she held it close to her heart as she closed her eyes,nwilling herself to relive the day the picture was taken. Opening herneyes and shaking away the tears, she picked up the picture of Ethannthat Jimmy had taken at her request. Itnwas already late afternoon when she asked Jimmy to do her the favor.nShe and Lucy were busy putting away the picnic basket and they couldnhear the two men arguing over how Ethan should pose for the picture.nEthan had jumped onto the hood of Jimmy's car and pulled his leg upnto balance himself. Jimmy was worried about his boots ruining thenpaint finish on the car. Ethan just wanted him to hurry up and takenthe shot. The women hadnfinished packing up the picnic basket and were on their way back tonthe car when Ethan suddenly looked up and saw Kara walking towardsnhim, smiling and glowing. A look that he matched with his own beamingnsmile. She remembered it well. Jimmy had said \"Hold that smilenman.\" and took the picture that was now resting in her hands. She wondered a lotnabout Ethan since she came back. Was he still waiting for her tonreturn? Would she still be able to find her way back to him? Would henstill love her? Or had another Jenna come his way and taken him away? \"Stop thinkingnlike an insecure girlfriend!\" she pretended that it was Ethannscolding her as she stared at the picture. \"Inknow you will wait for me.\" she told the image in the picture.nAfter lovingly tracing the lips of Ethan in the picture, she placednit under her pillow, a practice she began upon her return to hernparents home and then touched the wall behind her head to turn outnthe lights. ********** Lightnyears away from the inner space of Argo City, Ethan is working in thenMidvale School for Girls grounds. As he rode the lawnmower across thenLacrosse field, Lucy called out to him and waved while she headed tonher next class with a group of classmates. Waving back, he rememberednhow much he longed to be with Linda again. Reaching into his pocket,nhe pulled out the bracelet she had given him and touched the crystalnin the middle to his lips, tracing it the way he remembered Linda do.nWhen would he see her again?[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Summary: Chronicles the destructionnof Argo City and the inner turmoil that Kara must now battle in ordernto finally embrace Earth as her new home. The story is set 1 yearnafter Kara last returned to Earth. A Prophecy Fulfilled Whileneveryone else in Kara's class spilled out of their makeshiftnclassrooms after a day of rigorous classes had ended, she had to staynin the room and wait for her special lessons to begin. She reallynhated having to stay after class when she could already be at home,nhelping her family with the seemingly endless crystal packing, orneven spending some time with her childhood friends in the commissarynenjoying an after school snack and playing Kryptonian mind games.nKara never won the games because her sense of mental problem solvingnwas simply too slow for an average Kryptonian. However, she observednthat on Earth, she was one of the brightest in her class at thenMidvale School For Girls. Shenfound her mind wandering towards her Earth adventures while hernspecial tutor, Lai-La begun the lecture on the various Kryptoniannelements that continued to exist after their city survived thendestruction. There was a 3 dimensional rendition of Silver Kryptonitensitting on her desk which she absentmindedly poked. She was only halfnlistening to the lecture. \"SilvernKryptonite has various effects on Kryptonians who have been exposednto the yellow sun. But the most disturbing effect is paranoia andnpsychosis that possess our kind once exposed to...\" Lai-Lannoticed that her student's eyes were fighting sleep. Thensudden rapping on Kara's desk brought her out of her half sleepingnstate. \"Kara!nPay attention! Do not waste time!\" Lai-La scolded her. Shenslammed the projector shut and glared at the erring student. \"Inapologize. I am just so tired already.\" Kara yawned andnstretched out. \"Youndon't have time to rest Kara. Time is of the essence in your lessons.nWe have so much to cover...\" \"Why?\" \"Whynwhat?\" \"Whynis time of the essence? Why do I need all these special lessons?nThere are more girls in my class who are better equipped to handlenthese sort of thing.\" Unsurenabout how to properly answer the question, Lai-La thought it best tonskirt the issue instead. Her instructions were clear, she was not tonspeak of the prophecy to the girl until the Elders and her parentsndetermined that she was fully prepared to receive the news. \"Younbelong to a special breed Kara. The elders have agreed that you mustnbe prepared to be the Secret Keeper of Kryptonian History.\" \"Butnisn't that what Kal-El's Fortress of Solitude is for?\" shenquizzed her tutor as she got out of her seat to walk around a bit andnstretch her legs. 'Kal-Elnhas some of the knowledge. You on the other hand, shall come tonpossess the remaining knowledge that , when combined with the othersnin his fortress, shall tell the complete story of a once noble race.\" \"Younspeak as if our race is going to be annihilated in the future.\"nKara replied with concern in her voice. \"Nonrace can remain forever my child. We have been lucky to have foundnthis home when Krypton was destroyed by indifference and powernstruggles. There is nothing permanent in any world.\" \"Don'tnsay that!\" Kara gathered her things and headed towards the door.n\"I am done for the day.\" Lai-Landid not try to stop her from leaving. Everyone knew that Kara hadnchanged immensely during her last trip. She seemed to have a longingnto be more human than Kryptonian. She often acted in ways that werenuknown to them and was attributed to her exposure to human kind. Thisntemper tantrum was one instance. \"Didnyou see that?\" Lai-La turned to the wall behind her andnaddressed it directly. Zor-Elnand the Council of Elders suddenly projected onto the wall. \"Thisncannot go on much longer Zor-El, you must talk to Kara as soon asnpossible. The child must be prepared and in full understanding ofnwhat is to come.\" Bang-Or insisted as the council members noddedntheir heads in agreement. \"Itnis not easy to tell Kara about what is to come. She has done so muchnto insure the survival of Argo City.\" he addressed the gatherednmembers of the council. \"Andnnow she must insure the survival of our species and the protection ofna heritage. Tell her Zor-El. Do not defy this council.\" Bang-ornordered. \"Inndue time Bang-Or.\" \"Younhave been warned. We do not know how much longer we can keep thenillusion alive. The sphere is already functioning at minimal power.\" ********** Thenfamily sat in silence as they had their dinner. Kara somehow knewnthat she was in trouble and yet her father was not calling for anynsort of disciplinary action after she stormed out of her class. Henseemed to be very sad over the past few days. Ever since they startednpacking up the crystals. Even her mother seemed to be pre-occupied atntimes. She often saw her wiping away tears when she thought Kara wasnnot looking. Whatever the problem was, she hoped that they would justncome right out and say it, the way her human friends did. Thenfamiliar hum of the omegahedron that filled the Argonian air suddenlynstopped. The lights in the room visibly dimmed. Her parents looked atneach other in fright as Kara wondered what the problem was. A citynwide announcement came over the public address. \"Wenhave lost power to the 4th and 3rd power panel. Adjust your powernusage accordingly.\" \"Father,nI know something is wrong. Lai-La said something during my classntoday. Please tell me how I can help.\" Henlooked at her with confusion in his eyes. How do you tell your childnthat she is destined to live a life on a strange planet without thenparents who raised her and gave her the love and care that made hernthe strong young woman she now was? Mennsuddenly appeared at the door of their unit. Using a security pass tonopen their private door, they were the dressed as the SpherenGuardians. What would they want with the El's at this time of thennight? \"Zor-El,nyour presence is required at the chamber, bring Kara with you.\" \"What?nWhy ? The Elders have never asked to see me before.\" Karanwondered aloud. She gripped her fathers hand, her sense of fearnrunning through him. \"Comenwith me child. Everything will be alright. We will be back shortlynAlura.\" He assured his wife and child as he led the way. ********** ThenChamber of Elders reminded Kara of the Fortress of Solitude. It wasnall white and had no real seats to speak of. Merely large bouldersnfashioned out of the sides of the cave like room. The Elders were inndiscussion when they arrived. \"Zor-El,nthere is nothing more we can do. Panes 3 and 4 have died while 1 andn2 only has enough power to last us another day. You must send Kara onnher way.\" Bang-Or reiterated. \"Wait...nwait... panes dying? Power for one day? Where am I to go? Father,nwhat is going on?\" the fear and confusion could be heard in hernvoice. \"Havenyou not told her yet? What have you been doing all this time? \"nBang-Or addressed Zor-El directly. Zor-Elnplaced his hands on the back of his head. He threw his head back andnraised his hands in defeat. \"Thisnwas not how I wanted Kara to find out.\" He pleaded with thencouncil. \"Timenis of the essence.\" a voice from another elder reminded him. \"Inrealize that! But my daughter is not prepared...\" \"Shenwill have Kal-El to guide her.\" Karanlooked around in bewilderment. \"Time,nKal-El...\" It sounded like she was going to be sent on a missionnto Earth. A very delicate mission to Earth. \"Father,njust tell me.\" she tried to sound calm as she stood up andnapproached the makeshift council table. \"Kara,nthe sphere is no longer able to sustain life.\" Bang-Or began \"Bang-Or!nStop!\" Zor-El screamed in anger. \"Younhave left the council with no choice. Her ship is being prepared asnwe speak.\" \"Mynship? What? Father, please! Just tell me!\" \"Tellnher Zor-El!\" Henlooked at the council, his eyes filled with defeat and brimming withntears. \"Kara,n\" he began, choking on his words as he spoke. \" BeforenZaltar... went to the Phantom Zone... before he... died, he left usnwith a prophecy about the Omegahedron. One that is now seeingnfruition.\" \"Pleasenfather, be honest. Tell me the truth.\" \"Thenprophecy stated,\" he continued. \" that the sphere shallnfall into evil hands that shall drain it of its ability to sustainnlife and all that is good. It shall be the destruction of Argo City.\" \"No!nThat's not true!\" Kara cried out hugging her father. \"Itnis true my child.\" he kissed her cheek. \"Even though wencannot prevent the destruction, Zaltar had given us enough time andnwarning to know that you, Kara, my child, will be the one chosen tonsurvive the chaos and death. But in order to survive, we must sendnyou to Earth.\" \"Earth?\"nthe dawning of a new understanding hit her. \"The visit, thenbattle with Selena, the learning of the human ways, my extranlessons...\" \"Allnpreparations for your eventual departure.\" Bang-Or stated withnsadness in his voice. \"Younand Kal-El shall be the last children of Krypton. There shall be nonenmore to follow. However, we feel that regardless of how the two ofnyou shall live your human lives, you must somehow impart Kryptoniannknowledge upon your future heirs. Within their hearts Krypton andnArgo City shall live on.\" \"Wait?nYou said there is time, one day. We can still...\" \"Wenhave tried to keep the illusion alive for as long as we can Kara. Itnis time to accept our destinies.\" Another elder explained. \"Whatnis the true state of Argo City?\" she asked. \"Looknat the wall.\" she was told. Beforenher she saw the panels outside the dome. 2 were already dimmed ofnlights and the remaining 2 were flickering against the darkness. Karansuddenly sensed what she did not feel before. The air in the room hadnchanged. It was thin. Almost unbreathable. She started taking shallownbreaths. \"Thisncan't be happening.\" she said trying to deny the truth that wasnnow before her. The room was no longer as white as she first thought.nHer father seemed much older and looked tired. The temperature in thenroom was now freezing cold. Breakingnaway from her father, she tried to leave the room. This was notnhappening. She had to go home, go to her mother. She would makeneverything alright. She would tell her this was all a bad joke hernfriends were playing on her. Hernmother was standing outside the door when it slid open. The look onnKara's face confirmed her worst fears. \"Younknow.\" she cried. \"Mother,ntell me it isn't true. Tell me I can save the city.\" \"Zaltarnhas never been wrong my child.\" Bang-Ornand Zor-El were at their side and leading the way to the power sourcencenter. The Elders were now too tired to continue the charade. Peoplenwere beginning to walk around excitedly, wondering about what wasngoing on. Why had the power suddenly been cut off? Why was the airnthinning? All questions that they knew the answer to but could notnbring themselves to tell them. *********** Thensphere was now one thousand times larger than Kara remembered it tonbe. It seemed to want to break free of the constraints that stoppednit from slamming into the walls of the room it was held in. Duento its enormous size, the Elders had to create a special holding roomnthat would allow it to spin freely inside while growing in size, butnstill be viewable to the people who strove to control it. \"Whennit explodes, everything is over Kara.\" Bang-Or explained. \"ButnI don't understand. Why can't we cure it? You said you used the magicnbefore.\" She tried to understand all the information thatnBang-or and her parents were flooding her with. \"Selenanharmed the sphere Kara. When she bound herself to it, used it fornevil, she unleashed the most evil element of Kryptonian nature withinnOmegahedron.\" Zor-El explained. \"Whatnelement?\" \"Rednand Silver Kryptonite. The selfish and evil flames has kept the orbnbalanced with the white magic that we hoped would power the spherenfor many decades to come.\" Alura explained. \"Sonyou are telling me...?\" \"Kara,nyou are the chosen one. Just as Kal-El was the chosen one fromnKyrpton. Zaltar had said that the one to survive shall be the womannfrom the House of El who shall have seen the power of the yellow sunnupon her being.\" Her father finally finished telling her allnthat the prophecy contained. There was no mistaking Kara's fate andndestiny anymore.. \"Butnthe children...\" Kara sadly emphasized. \"Oncenexposed to the Red and Silver Kryptonite, everyone here, shall fallnprey to the same power struggle and psychosis that destroyednKrypton.\" \"Inwon't let that happen to you. Come with me!\" she begged hernparents. \"Enough!nYou will gather her things and meet me at the binary chute.\"nBang-Or ordered. ********** Thenhyper speed whirling of the sphere was now strongly felt throughoutnArgo City. People were running in panic. Not really understandingnwhat was going on. As the family ran back to their quarters, they sawnpeople dropping like flies as their systems could no longer processnthe air that surrounded them. Areas of the city were now covered inncomplete darkness. There was no power in their home either. \"Bang-Ornshall take care of packing the crystals into the ship. Take only whatnis necessary Kara.\" her father advised her. Hernparents busied themselves putting together what momentos the could ofntheir family for Kara to treasure them by. Takingnher souvenir box from under the bed, she could not bring herself tonjoin her parents in the main room. Exactly how does a child deal withnher parents declaration that they are willing to die so that she cannlive? What use was living if she had no family? There was no sense innreturning to Earth. \"Father,nmother, I am not going. I shall stay right here with you and acceptnthe inevitable with the you and the others.\" she begged them. \"Kara!nNow is not the time!\" He carried her over his shoulders andncarried her out the door. \"Nonfather! Please! Let me stay!\" she begged as she tried to squirmnout of his grip. \"Zor-El!nYou are hurting her!\" Alura blocked him from getting out thendoor. Henset Kara down on the floor. Tears streaming down her face. Her eyesnpleading for understanding. Turning to his wife, he saw the samenlook. \"Mynchild! My child! I am so sorry! Forgive me!\" he hugged herntightly. Alura came over and hugged her family as well. \"Younmust live Kara.\" Alura pleaded with her daughter. \"You willnnot be alone. Kal-El will always be your family. We will always benwith you, in your heart and mind.\" \"Ohnmother!\" Nobodynnoticed the guards show up at the very door they were standing at. \"IsnKara ready?\" Withnher parents eyes upon her, she nodded weakly. If this was their dyingnwish, she would honor it with the strength and maturity that isnexpected from a descendant of the House Of El. ********** Thenship was ready to depart when they arrived at the binary chute. Thisnship was bigger than the last one she used and tightly packed withnthe crystal boxes. Kara never realized there were that many boxes innthe hall. \"Alwaysnremember who you are and where you came from Kara.\" Aluranwhispered to her daughter as they hugged for the last time. \"Mother...\"nher voice broke as she fought back the tears. \"Listennto Kal-El Kara. He is your family now. He will care for you. Give himnthis crystal, it will explain everything to him.\" Zor-El handednKara a greenish gold crystal that held the story of Argo City fornKal-El to understand. Thendome ceiling suddenly shuddered and produced cracks. It was going tonexplode any minute. \"Hurry!\"nBang-Or ordered, pulling her parents away from the loading dock sonKara would be forced to board the ship. \"Wenwill try to hold the city steady long enough to get you into thenpathway. Once inside, the path will implode behind you. There is noncoming back. Do not even try.\" \"GonKara!\" her parents ordered her in unison. Shenturned and boarded the ship. Floating almost immediately into thenchute path, the dome began to cave in. The prophecy had begun. ********** Nobodyncould explain why pond was suddenly frozen over. The weather changenhappened suddenly that morning. The temperature in the down droppednto below freezing. Everyone in MIdvale was bundled up in winternclothes in the middle of Spring. It was now the middle of the nightnand the only beings at the lake were the rabbits, deers, and othernanimals that were seeking shelter from the cold. Atnthe same time that the Omegahedron exploded in Argo City, Kara's shipnburst through the pond packed solidly in something that looked likenpowdered, sticky snow. The impact of the ship on the ice covered pondnsent the ice crystals flying upward, reaching into the sky as thenKara tried to control the ship that was now flying crazily throughnthe dark skyline. Snownbegan to fall over Midvale as the remnants of Argo city and thenOmegahedron blew up into the sky. Immediately condensing, it frozenRed and Silver Kryptonite within its molecules that fell to then instantly into a water upon hitting anything solid. Anconcentration of the rocks fell around the pond grounds, the restnburned up upon hitting the trees and other rock forms in the forestndue to the sudden changes in temperature. Had the town not beennasleep, the residents would have witnessed an inexplicable weathernchange and fireworks display. Crashingnthrough an abandoned farming field, the ship burst into flames,nmelting the snow around it. Kara was thrown out of the ship and laynunconsciously in a puddle not far from the flame ridden ship. Shenawoke moments later, dazed but in full control of her senses, seeingnthe chaos around her, she screamed in desperation. Realizing that hernparents and everything she held dearest to her were now gone. She wasnalone. The last of her kind. \"Whatnnow Kara? Where do you go?\" she asked herself. Thenanswer was clear. There was only person on Earth who knew how to makenher feel safe and secure. He would know what to do. Withoutndonning her alter ego suit, she took off with only one destination innmind. ********** Ethanntried to get warm under the covers as he prepared to sleep. Keepingnthe school grounds well manicured always left him exhausted. Lucynoften asked him why he kept his contract live with them when it wasnalmost impossible for him to tend to the grounds alone. They bothnknew the answer to that question. He felt closest to Linda at thenschool, knowing that this was the first place she called home onnEarth. He was always frequenting the places that reminded him of her.nHoping that one day, she would surprise him the way she had done atnFrostee's. Henalmost failed to notice the faint glow coming from the bracelet onnhis night table. Realizing that it never glowed for him until thatnnight, he felt an excitement at the thought that maybe, just maybe,nLinda was back. How did it work again? The closer the Kryptonian, thenbrighter the glow. Well then, this glow was beginning to blind him.nMaybe, just maybe...? Henfollowed the glow as it began to hum and the blue and red bands begannto glow. Reaching his front door, he opened it and looked out intonthe dark night. \"Ethan...\"nhe seemed to hear a faint female voice calling him. \"Linda?\"nhe asked. Nonanswer. He closed the door and decided that the bracelet must benacting up. But the voice seemed real. He treturned to bed and ried tonsleep but the bracelet was still emmiting all sorts of sounds and thenlights would not turn off. Gettingnout of bed and grabbing his jacket, he headed out the door. Maybe anquick jog would get his body warm enough to fall asleep and ignorenthe bracelet. Henheard a rustling sound in the bushes near the compound exit. \"EthannI'm here...\" There was simply no mistaking that voice he sonlonged to hear. Pryingnthe bushes apart, he finally saw her, wearing the dirtied customarynwhite gown of Kryptonian women that signified her coming of age innKryptonian society. She was floating slightly above the bush in ordernto see him. He wondered where the familiar costume she once told himnwere her clothes were. \"Linda!nI mean Kara! I mean...\" He called out to her, slightly confusednas to what to really call her in his excitement. Shenlanded softly in front of him and without either of them thinking,nfell into each other's arms, sharing the sweetest kiss they had evernexperienced till then. Atnthat moment Kara knew, she was loved and safe for the moment.[Chapter 3] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

As they slowly parted,nhe noted her wet cheeks and a look in her blue eyes that he had nevernseen before. This was not the same Kara who left him a year ago.nSomething had changed. Hernbody was shaking in his arms. Something that he knew was not normalnsince the freezing temperature of Superman's fortress did not bothernher at all. He wrapped an arm around her and led her up to hisnapartment. She seemed so weak, defeated, lonely. ********** \"Drinknthis...\" he handed her a hot cup of cocoa to warm her up. \"Linda,ncall me Linda. Kara is no more.\" her tears began to build upninside again. \"Whatnare you talking about?\" Ethan wondered aloud as he sat besidenher on the couch. \"Karanis from Argo City. Argo City is gone. Destroyed. The only home I havenever known is gone. My parents are dead.\" she said fighting awaynthe emotions that threatened to surface as tears as she stared intonthe cup. Henpulled her closer to him and hugged her. \"Younhave a home here with me Linda.\" \"Inknow Ethan. I feel safe with you. I feel loved.\" His loving armsnseemed to encourage her to let go of her emotions. He wiped away herntears with his handkerchief and lay her head on his shoulder. \"Thennyou will stay with me?\" he asked hopefully. \"Staynwith you on Earth? Yes. But I will live with Kal-El, it was mynparent's dying wish.\" she wiped her wet cheeks with the palm ofnher hand. Hensmiled brightly at her. That was a good enough answer for him. Henknew what it was like to lose parents, having lost his when he was innhigh school. They died in a plane crash and left the gardeningnbusiness to him. He needed to make the business work and hisneducation was sacrificed. He still hoped to go back to school onenday. Sleepnfinally came over her. She yawned as she placed the empty cup on thencoffee table. \"Younbetter get some sleep now. We can talk in the morning. Take the bed.\"nHe pointed towards the pull out bed he had set up against the wall innhis studio apartment. \"Wherenwill you sleep?\" she asked him wondering if he would be sleepingnnext to her. Henpatted the couch that they were sitting on. \"This is prettyncomfortable.\" he smiled at her. ********** Lindanwas still asleep when Ethan called Lucy to come over to his place. Henknew that she would be thrilled to have her best friend back. Therenwas also this gut feeling that told him Linda would need a woman tontalk to. \"HinMrs. Lane. May I please speak to Lucy?\" he whispered into thenreceiver. \"Lucy,nit's Ethan.\" he heard her call for her daughter. \"Ethan,nit's Saturday morning. Have you ever heard of sleeping in?\" Lucynscolded him as they heard her mother put the extension phone downnwith a click. \"Inknow, but I have some great news. How soon can you get here?\" henwhispered as he watched Linda stir in bed. She had been fitful allnnight and barely let him sleep with her soft crying. He wondered ifnshe slept at all. \"Twonhours.\" Lucy was being sarcastic. \"Makenit two minutes. And Lucy, bring some breakfast for 3.\" \"Firstnof all, who do you think I am? Kara? I don't fly. Second of all, younwill owe me for breakfast. And lastly, who is the third person? \" \"Justnget here.\" he insisted before putting the phone down. ********** Lucynclimbed the stairs to Ethan's 2nd floor apartment with an armful ofnFrostee's breakfast meals. She was mumbling about having to get up onnsuch a wet day. Little did she know about the midnight snowfallncourtesy of Kara's return. The snow was now just slosh in the streetsnand everybody who was up that early was wading through semi-floodednstreets. \"It'snsupposed to be Spring!\" she mumbled miserably as she pressed thendoorbell. Nobodynopened the door. \"Ethan!nIt's Lucy!\" she hollered. Shenheard an excited thud from within. Linda had jumped out of bed a bitntoo heavily upon hearing her friend's name. \"Great!nHe probably tripped over something.\" she thought to herself. \"Lucy!\"nLinda excitedly opened the door and took the bags from her bestnfriends hands. \"Ohnmy god! Linda!\" she squealed in delight running into the room. Afternminutes of hugging and loud voices, Ethan, who had been standing bynthe kitchen entry watching the two women cleared his throat. \"Hownabout continuing the reunion over breakfast?\" he asked them asnhe set out the food on the coffee table. His apartment was so smallnthat his coffee table doubled as a dining table for when he hadnguests. Afternthey had finally settled down, Linda told Lucy all about why she wasnback on Earth. Lucy immediately suggested contacting Superman. Theynwere in luck she said, Lois was staying with the family and Clark wasnwith her. They both knew how to contact Superman. Lucy stoppedntalking and stared at Kara, as if remembering something for the firstntime. \"Itncan't be... but that is the only logical... Clark is Kal-El isn'tnhe?\" she waited for her friend to confirm what should have beennpainfully obvious to her one year ago. Karansimply nodded her head. \"Inbet Lois knows.\" Lucy thought aloud, a bit annoyed at thenpossiblity that her sister had kept a huge secret from her. \"So,nwhere will you be staying in the meantime? Mom and dad would love tonhave you over again if you haven't got a place.\" she asked Lindanbetween bites of her sandwich. Lindanlooked over at Ethan. He nodded at her. He was not going to push hernto do anything she did not want to do. At least not at this time. \"I'dnlove to come over for a few days.\" she answered. \"Well,nI'll only be at home until Sunday. We should get you enrolled atnMidvale School again.\" she suggested while dipping her pickleninto catsup. \"But,nI never finished the last term...\" \"Don'tnworry about that. I'll have my dad ask Principal Danvers to give younan equivalency exam. We can both be Seniors! You'll love the dance!\"nLucy enticed her friend. \"I'mnnot sure. Have to ask Kal-El...\" \"Henwill say yes even if Lois has to force it out of him.\" Lucynassured her. ********** Thenfamiliar truck of Ethan drove onto the abandoned farm where the shipnhad crash landed. The remnants of the ship were still smoldering asnthey approached. The boxes of crystals were nowhere to be found. \"Ohnno! Where is it?\" Kara wailed as she started to dig into the hotnground. \"Woah!\"nStop it Linda!\" Ethan pulled her back in a panic, forgettingnthat the extreme heat could do not physically hurt her. \"Thencrystals! My parents entrusted it to me!\" \"Whatncrystals?\" Lucy wanted to know. \"Mynheritage. Those crystals are my responsibility.\" \"Inhave them Kara.\" they all turned to see Kal-El landing behindnthem. \"Kal-El!\"nshe ran to her cousin and hugged him, crying once again. \"Inknow Kara. I found the crystal.\" his voice cracked as henacknowledged the fate of his last remaining relatives. \"Didnyou..?\" \"Thencrystals are safe in the fortress.\" he assured her. \"Uh,nexcuse me, Superman... how did you know?\" Ethan asked him tryingnto avoid standing too close to the Man of Steel. \"Thenweather disturbance. I was trying to find the source. When I saw thenburning ship and Kara was not in it, I knew she would go to hernfriends since she did not know where to find me. That is why I camenback today. I knew she would come back here with you guys for thencrystals.\" he explained. Lucynand Ethan stayed in the truck while Superman and Linda, who had nownchanged into her alter ego outfit, worked together to bury thenremnants of the spaceship so deep into the earth that the two whonwere watching thought dinosaur bones would be unearthed. \"Cannthe three of you be at the Lane's for the barbecue this afternoon?\"nKal-El asked. Kara had told him that Lucy already figured out hisnalter ego. \"I'llnbring Linda, I mean Kara, this is going to get confusing.\" Ethannlaughed at himself for not figuring out what to call his girlfriend. \"Youncan bring Linda over with you at 3.\" Lucy solved his problem fornhim. ********** \"Thengang's all here!\" Jimmy announced when Linda and Ethan finallynshowed up at the poolside of the Lane home. He threw a beer at Ethannwhich he caught with both hands. \"Linda,nget over here, I want you to meet Lois.\" Lucy tugged on hernfriend's arm so that she would let go of Ethan. \"Gonon Linda. I'll shoot some pool with Jimmy.\" he encouraged her.nShe had been so sad since they got back from the farm that he knewnshe needed this get-together more than he did. This was simply hisnway of taking care of her. Loisnwas busy mixing drinks at the mini-bar. She was dressed reallyncasually now that the weather had finally returned to normalnspringtime temperature. Aside from an early morning news report aboutnthe sudden weather change, it seems nobody knew about the snow fall.nKara and Kal-El preferred it that way as well. \"Thisnis my best friend in all of Midvale.\" Lucy introduced Linda tonLois. \"Hi.nI heard you are Clark's cousin.\" Lois started on the small talk. \"Cutnit sis. we both know who Clark really is.\" Lucy winked at hernsister. \"Thenndon't let the whole world hear you.\" she warned the youngernLane. \"Speakingnof which, where is he?\" Linda asked. \"Younknow your cousin, there is always something that needs fixing in innsome part of the world...\" \"Thenworld can always use extra supers.\" Clark whispered to Lois,nplanting a kiss on her cheek. Somehow they all knew that the gentlenbreeze that passed overhead was him. SincenLois figured out his secret, their relationship both as work and lovenpartners had been easier for them to handle. With the addition ofnKara, Clark would finally get the family and grounding that thenLane's offered him a little of. \"Lunchnis served!\" Mr. Lane announced as he got the last steak off thengrill. Mrs. Lane had also walked into the area with some freshlynboiled sweet corn. \"Everybodynmove to the table.\" Mrs. Lane announced as she set down thenplatter. ********** \"Inwas planning to enroll Linda at the school for girls. She alreadynstarted a term there but she had to pull out.\" Clark repliednwhen Mr. Lane asked him what his plans were for his cousin. \"ButnLinda is too bright to be a junior. She should be a Senior in mynclass. I can't have my best friend in the subordinate level at thendorm.\" Lucy complained. \"Thenprincipal owes me a few favors. Let me see what I can do.\" Hernfather told her. \"ThanksnDad!\" \"SonLinda, where are you staying at the moment? Clark lives in Metropolisnbut you've always seemed to be a Midvale girl to me.\" \"Inspent the night at Ethan's.\" she answered truthfully. Thenolder Lanes looked at her in shock. She did not know why. There wasnnothing wrong with what she said. If they had asked her, she wouldnhave told them about the separate beds. Kryptonian women never sleptnin the same bed as their mate until after they were bound by the lawsnof science and the land. \"Seperatenrooms. We don't do that. We made a promise to each other. Not tillnafter we are married.\" Ethan assured them as he took Linda'snhand under the table and held it from where she sat beside him. Henmeant what he said. He was never going to pressure this delicatenyoung woman into anything she did not want to do. Not because henfeared what she could do to him, but because he respected everythingnabout her, and that included honoring her Kryptonian heritage as henslowly learned about it. \"Nicento hear the young ones talk with conviction about avoidingnpre-marital sex.\" Mrs. Lane responded as she passed the cornntray to her husband. She was not sure if she believe them but ifnLinda was anything like Clark, she was not going to do anything thatnshe might eventually regret. \"Innthe meantime, Linda can stay with us.\" Mr. Lane sounded like henwas giving an order instead of offering a favor to Clark. \"Inwould like that.\" Linda smiled. \"Wencan all sleep in Lois' room until she leaves on Monday. It'll be likena sleep-over.\" Lucy told her excitedly. ********** \"Kara,nwalk with me.\" Kal-El told his cousin after the family hadnretired to the house for some dessert. \"Whatnis it cousin?\" she asked him as they sat on the edge of the poolnand dipped their feet in. \"Inwanted to give you this. I found it amongst the ruins.\" henproduced the box that her parents had packed for her from his pantsnpocket. Thenbox that was the size of a ring box expanded once she held it in hernhands. The top had the emblem of the House Of El and opened afternKara passed the hand biometric scan. \"It'snwhat's left of our ancestors.\" she tried to blink away herntears. Kal-Elntook the box from her and looked at the contents. This is what thenonce mighty Kryptonian race had been reduced to. A box full of Snemblem souveniers. Nothing that made sensento Kal-El since everything was written in Kryptonian symbols. Shenopened mini box using a biometric scan of her hand.\"This is anlock of my childhood hair.\" she took out the sealed silvernsee-through container that held her brownish hair to show him. \"Thesenare the crystal plates of our family tree. You can see these betternat the fortress. It expands when you place it on the proper crystal.\" Shenlooked at Kal-El with sadness in her eyes. \"Donyou want me to keep it at the fortress for you?\" he asked. \"Please.\"nKara replied. ********** Thenweek-end passed so fast for the 3 young women. Lois and Lucy tooknturns giving Linda a make-over. Lucy also helped her get her old jobnat Frostee's back. Dean still rememebered Linda as his most efficientnemployee before she disappeared on him. She made a promise that shenwould not up and leave without telling him this time before henfinally agreed to hire her back. \"Nownthat we are workmates, the only thing left is to become room matesnagain at Midvale. I have a single again this year. But I would gladlynbump it up to a double for my best friend.\" Lucy told her as then3 girls had a snack in the food court after a day of shopping. \"Shenhas to pass the equivalency first. \" Lois pointed out. \"That'snnothing. Ask her how many people will exist in America by the yearn2010.\" Lucy bragged remembering the question that Linda hadneffortlessly answered in computer class when they were Sophomores. \"SorrynLinda, Lucy has always wanted a baby sister, I guess you are it.\"nThey all laughed at Lois' statement.[Chapter 4] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

StartingnAnew Clarknand Mr. Lane were both at the school that Monday to help pleadnLinda's case with Principal Danvers. Since Linda had abruptly leftnthe school previously, she was considered to have been dropped andnblack listed from the school roster. Sitting in his office, the 3 mennseemed to be at a stalemate. \"There is absolutely no waynI can let her back in after the last time. She never completed any ofnher assigned work and she escaped from the school as well. She is anrebel and has no place in our upstanding educational system.\"nthe principal stated resolutely as Clark and Mr. Lane took turnsnpresenting their case for Linda's re-admittance. \"Lindanis not a rebel Mr. Danvers. I already explained to you that I had tonpull her out at that time for family matters. You know her parentsnhad just died at the time and I needed her help in getting theirnaffairs in order. I am sorry for not being able to formally informnyou. Everything happened so suddenly.\" Clark explained. \"Mr.nKent, I understand that perfectly well. If I were not bound by thenschool regulations, I would probably have agreed to let her back in.nBut it is too late in the term to admit her...\" \"Wenaren't asking you to bend any rules that can't be bent Fred. You didnit once for Linda, why can't you do it again? You'd do it for anynother girl who took leave from school mid-term as well.\" Mr.nLane prodded his friend. \"She is a really bright girl.nYou just have to give her a chance.\" Clarknadded. ********** Linda was sitting outside the officentrying not to use her super hearing to hear the conversation inside.nShe was not really sure if boarding school was the right place fornher to be at the moment. She longed for a chance to properly grievenfor her parents. It made her wonder how humans dealt with matters ofndeath. If she were in Argo City, there would be a day of city-widenmourning. Since everybody knew each other, the grief caused by deathnwas something that everyone shared and dealt with openly. It was okaynto cry out in the open, something she was embarassed to do on Earthnbecause of her unfamiliarity with the social norms. She wouldnprobably be organizing the transfer of her parent's Crystals ofnKnowledge to the Hall Of Learning by this time. Indeed, she knewneverything about grieving the Kryptonian way, but how was it done onnthis planet? A shrill sound permeated the air as studentsnbegan to fill the corridors. It was time for morning break. She hopednthat Lucy would be able to make it to the office for a few minutes sonshe could have some company. She felt so alone and uncomfortable asnthe secretary stared at her for some reason. \"Not you twonagain... What did you do this time?\" she heard the woman whinenas two girls entered the room. Lindanrecognized them instantly. Myra and Muffy were standing in the roomnchewing gum and trying to look tough as usual. Of course their toughngirl act had no effect on Linda who had already taught them a lessonnthe first time they tried to bully her. They were going to scald thengirls who were taking a shower after a La Crosse game but thanks tonKara's super hearing, x-ray vision, and heat vision, they got the hotnshower of their lives instead. \"What are you doing backnhere runt?\" Myra practically growled her words at Linda. \"Inhave no problem with you. Please Myra, leave me alone.\" shenturned her back to them from her seat so as to avoid anynaltercations. She did not see the two girls start to whisper behindnher back. Lucy came bouncing into the room at that verynmoment. She saw the two other girls but chose to ignore them sincenthey were practically stock holders in the principal's office. \"Anynnews yet?\" Lucy was giddy with excitement as she took a seatnbeside Linda. \"Nothing. I do not think this is going tonhappen.\" Linda's super hearing was giving her the impressionnthat Principal Danvers was not going to budge on hisndecision. \"Don't worry, Dad and Clark will think ofnsomething.\" she seemed to be assuring herself more than hernfriend. At that moment, Clark and Bill Lane stepped out of thenoffice with mixed expressions on their faces. ********** Ethannwas busy cutting off the excess tree branches that were hanging overnthe softball field when he heard Linda hollering his name. Henwondered if she used super voice projection because he could not seenher anywhere. She finally appeared in his line of sight,nrunning very fast with a gleeful expression on her face. He hurriedlynstepped off the ladder, trying to clean up his arms and shake off hisnshirt as best as he could. He was all sweaty and messy from the worknhe had been doing all morning. \"I'm in! I passed thenequivalency test!\" she announced as she hugged himntightly. \"That's fantastic Linda! I knew you could donit.\" he took her arms off from around his neck. He saw the hurtnin her eyes. She did not understand why he did that. \"I'mnsweaty Linda, and stinking. I don't want to get you dirtied up.\"nShe seemed so sensitive these days. Something that he chose tonattribute to her having to deal with the abrupt loss and unimaginablenchanges happening to her at present. \"Tell you what. Letnme finish up my work for the day and get cleaned up. How about I picknyou up tonight around 6:30? We can have a celebratory dinner.\" \"Thatnsounds great. I have to move my things into the dorm immediatelynthough. Pick me up here. Lois and Lucy will help me move in all day.\"nshe gave him a quick kiss then ran off. Ethan saw Clark signaling fornher to come over to where he was standing with Mr. Lane andnLucy. ********** \"Lois and I will take care ofngetting your school supplies. In the meantime, Lucy has promised thatnyou can borrow her books.\" Kal-El told Kara as they had lunch atnhis apartment in Metropolis. They had flown together after Mr. Lanenwas out of sight and Lucy was back in school. Linda playednwith her food. She was not really hungry for some reason. All shenwanted to do was curl up into a ball and cry. \"Suck it innKara. You can't live everyday this depressed. You have to move on.\"nhe advised her as he cleared the table. \"You don'tnunderstand how I feel Kal-El. You never met your parents exceptnthrough the knowledge crystals and you did not spend enough time withnmine to actually care about them the way I do.\" Kara explainednas she moved to the kitchen and helped him load thendishwasher. \"That's not fair of you to say Kara. We havensuffered the same loss. We both have no family now. We are both nownpart of a lost heritage. Don't make this all about you. I am grievingnas well.\" he told her. After turning the knobs on thenwasher, Kal-El proceeded to his living room. Kara followed him andnsat beside him. She cold not believe he was grieving. He showed nonsigns of it. Or maybe this was how the humans did it? After all,nKal-El was more human than Kryptonian having grown up on earth. Shenmust have fallen asleep on the couch because the next thing she knew,nLois was waking her up and tellng her to get ready to go clothesnshopping. Kara had a very limited supply of human clothes. The pairnof pants and blouse that she was wearing was a hand me down fromnLois. \"Let me talk to her Clark. She needs a woman tontalk to.\" she heard Lois advising Clark while she freshened upnin the bathroom and got ready to leave. \"I don't know hownto handle this Lois. I will appreciate the help.\" he toldnher. Kara stepped out of the bathroom and went into the livingnroom where Lois and Clark were discussing her. \"I am ready to gonLois.\" ********** Kara was amazed at how manynthings Earth girls needed in order to survive. There were clothes,njewelry, cosmetics, shoes, night gowns, underwear... everything madenher head spin. At least she now understood the concept of money. Shendid not understand why she needed to have it the last time she camento the planet for a visit. \"Linda, you do know that youncan talk to Clark, Lucy, me, or just about anybody in the family ifnyou need to get some things off your chest right?\" Loisnand she were seated at a coffeehouse in the mall. This was Linda'snfirst taste of coffee. It tasted bitter to her. Lois suggestednadding more cream and sugar to the mix. It improved the taste enoughnto make the bitter beverage bearable for her. Linda sadly understoodnthat she would have to get used to these strange tastes now. Shenwould no longer be able to go home for Alura's version of home cookednmeals. Those were now just memories for her. \"I know thatnLois and I thank you for the offer. I just need to deal with thisnprivately for now.\" Linda explained. Hownwould it be possible for her to tell Lois that she wanted to just benleft alone to scream and scream and cry and cry until she wasnemotionally spent? Then maybe, she could get on with her life. \"Justnremember, you can't handle everything alone. Sometimes, you need tonlet other people help you and understand what you are feeling.\" \"IfnI need somebody to talk to, Lucy will just be in the next bed.' Lindanreferred to the sleeping arrangement in the dorm at MidvalenSchool. \"And you can always fly to Ethan anytime.\"nLois teased her. Lighting up at the mention of Ethan's name,nLois knew that Ethan would be the key to helping Linda get throughnthis change in her life. She just hoped that Linda's boyfriend wouldnbe up to the super challenge. \"Look at the time. Wenshould get you back to the school.\" She gathered the bags andngot up from her seat. \"I need to get one of thosenthings.\" Linda said pointing to the watch on Lois' wrist. \"Anwatch? Let's pick one up on the way out.\" \"Whatnabout the money? I have not started work yet and you have alreadynspent so much.\" \"Clark has spent so much. Don'tnworry about it. We want to take care of you. \" Lois winked atnher. ********** \"Sit still Linda! I don't want tonpoke your eye out!\" Lucy said in exasperation. Shenwas trying to help Linda prepare for her date. Ethan was due at thendorm to pick her up in a half hour and so far, the only thing thatnwas ready was Linda's casual slacks and blouse that Lois picked outnthat day for her to wear on the date. \"Do I really neednto put all of this on? I mean, Ethan already loves me without allnthese things.\" \"Girl, you have a lot to learn. Ifnyou want to keep Ethan, you gotta up the volume on the X-nFactor.\" \"X- factor?\" \"Remind me tonget you some fashion magazines. That will explain everything.\"nher friend said as the intercom on the wall buzzed. \"Linda,nThere is an Ethan Logan in the reception area for you.\" \"ThanksnJulie. Tell him Linda wil be right down.\" Lucy answered the callnfor her. Julie was the head girl of their dorm room. \"Tellnher to hurry. Ethan is a hunk.\" \"Don't mind her. Shendid not mean that.\" Lucy told Linda who had just slipped intonher clothes. \"Don't mind what?\" \"II'llnexplain it to you some other time.\" Lucy then realized that hernfriend had not idea about what flirting was. After a few morenfashion adjustments. Linda was out the door. \"I set yournwatch to chime at 9:30. That is to remind you that dorm curfew is atn10. Now go and enjoy your date.\" Lucy cheered her friend on asnshe went down the stairs to meet Ethan.[Chapter 5] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Whethernhe agreed or not, Ethan had already gone ahead and done it anyway. Hentook the pocket of time Linda spent with Lois and Lucy over the pastncouple of days to make his choice and list the talking points henwould use to convince Clark that he wasn't going to abuse the trustnhe and Linda had placed in him. He believed that his plan would makenLinda very happy and help her adjustment process. Provided Clark didnnot change into Superman and pound him into the ground for evennsuggesting it. He called up Clark who was back at work at ThenDaily Planet and asked him meet him at a diner near Ethan's Midvalengardening office. There was no sense in him driving all the way tonMetropolis when Clark could easily meet him anywhere. As they sharedna sandwich and coffee snack, Clark seemed to be listening intently tonhis suggestion. If everything went according to plan, he would benable to present Linda with his surprise during their date that night. \"I see what you mean Ethan. After all, that is why Increated the Fortress of , I am concerned about hownKara would take to it. It is a tremendous departure from Kryptonianntraditions. She may not like it. \" Clark seemed to have an opennmind about the idea. \"We won't be breaking anyntraditions. I just want to make sure that she will actually have anplace on Earth. Somewhere she can feel secure and know that it is anpermanent part of her life.\" Ethan assured Clark, he was gladnthat Clark did not go all super on him and instead accepted hisnsuggestion. \"If Kara is okay with it. I don't see why Incan't let her try it. After all, if you even try to harm a hair onnher...\" \"I plan on living to a ripe old age Clark.\"nhe assured the man of steel. ********** Dinner had gonensmoothly for the pair. Raiken was a new Japanese restaurant at thenPromenade that they decided to try out. Linda enjoyed the food butndrew the line at Sushi. She was not sure if her system was ready toneat raw earth food. After a shared Green Tea ice cream forndessert, Linda was ready to call it a night. She was tired from allnthe activities of the day and, even though she wanted nothing morenthan to stay in Ethan's company all night, she had to get back tonschool. \"One more stop then I promise to take you back tonschool.\" he handed her the extra helmet for her to wear. Sincenthey were riding in tandem on his motorcycle, she had to wear thenhead shield. Even though there was no motorcycle accident that couldnpossibly turn her into pink mist, she still wore the helmet becausenthe law of the land dictated it. Ethan could be arrested if he wasnseen with an unprotected back seat passenger. \"Okay. Butnlet's not stay wherever it is too long alright? I have an early classntomorrow.\" She put on the helmet and got behind him. Thenroar of the motorcycle as it sped away from the parking lot wasndeafening for most people who heard it. Linda held on tight to hisnwaist not because she was afraid of falling off, but because shenliked the feel of being so close to his skin. She liked the smell ofnwhat she found out was called aftershave lotion on him. It remindednher of the smell of morning dew on the grass that she smelled thenfirst time she came to earth. They turned into a middle classnsuburb of Midvale. The streets were lined with identical double storynhouses. She wondered what there would be for them to do there. Shendid not know anybody who lived there. Well, the Lane's lived about 5nminutes away from the area. But in Linda's mind, they did notncount. He pulled the motorcyle into the driveway of a simplenlooking house. The exterior paint was cream and looked like thosenhomes she saw in the magazines that were in Lois' room. The light wasnon in the living room. \"This is a nice house. Who livesnhere?\" she asked after Ethan had turned off the engine and hencould finally hear her speak. \"You'll find out.\" hensmiled mischeviously at her as he walked up to the door and unlockednit. \"C'mon.\" he told her as he held the door opennfor her. The house was simply furnished inside. It was nothingnas elegant as the Lane's house. This one had a very small backyardnand a kitchen just big enough for 2 people to move around in. Thendining table was only good for 4 people. \"Take a looknupstairs.\" he encouraged her by taking her hand and leading thenway. There were 2 bedrooms. The first one she opened remindednher of the way Ethan's apartment was set up. In fact, the bed seemednawfully familiar to her. What was going on? After accidentallynopening the door to the only bathroom in the house, the next door hadnher gasping in surprise. Some of the clothes that she and Lois hadnbought were lying on the bed. Some of the shopping bags were on thenfloor. The dresser in the corner of the room held the memorabilia boxnthat she had asked Kal-El to keep for her at the Fortress ofnSolitude. \"Do you like it?\" Ethan asked her. Henpulled her by the waist and hugged her from behind. \"Whynare your and my things here? What's going on? \" she asked,nalmost guessing the answer. She felt excitement building up withinnher as she anticipated his explanation. \"I wanted us tonhave a place to call our own. Where we can both live comfortably andnnot have to worry about living space. Where we can each have ournindividual spaces but still be together when we want to be. It's justna rental. \" He began to explain. \"Inwanted you to have a place to call home. After all, Clark has thenfortress and his apartment. All you have is the dorm and that is notnever going to be home for you.\" he reached into his pocket andnpulled out a silver necklace that had a silver key attached as thenpendant. \"We have a saying on earth, \"Home is wherenthe heart is.\" My heart is at home here and I am hoping, thatnyour heart will be at home here with me.\" He cleared Linda'snneck of hair and clasped the necklace with great care around hernneck. She went over to the dresser mirror to see what he hadnplaced around her neck. The key was engraved with the name \"Ethan\".nShe could not believe it. What did he think they were going tondo? \"Mine says Linda. Our key's open the door to thenhouse.I figured it was symbolic. Our hearts could both find a homenhere.\" \"You promised me that you were not going tonpressure me.\" she reminded him as she sat on the bed and triednto understand what was happening. \"No pressure Linda.nLook, we have seperate rooms. We won't do anything you don't want tondo.\" he assured her. \"I have to talk tonKal-El...\" \"He said if it was okay with you and Inswore not to do anything stupid with you, he would not pound me intonthe center of the earth.\" he told her sitting beside her andnlifting her face up to his as he spoke. \"Are younmad?\" \"Not mad. Just confused. I don't know...\" \"Injust thought that you would want a place to call home. A place toncome to when you need to be alone. I will be at work most of the daynand you will be at the boarding school 5 days out of 7. You can'tnstay at the Lane's every week-end.\" he reasoned. \"ButnKryptonian tradition dictates certain things.\" she tried tonexplain. \"Kal-El told me. I understand. I just want tontake care of you Linda. Won't you let me do that?\" he appealednto her. He wanted to take care of her. She wanted to be takenncare of. She wanted a place to call home. A place to call her own.nEthan was willing to give that to her. No strings attached. Why notngive it a chance? \"Linda, my family died when I was veryn helped me out. I had nobody to take care of me. Mynrelatives eventually got tired of keeping me in their homes so Ineventually had to make a life of my own before I was actually ready.nI have always had to take care of myself. I don't have any othernfamily. When you came into my life, you changed that. I wasn't alonenanymore. Believe me when I say I know what you are going through. Younneed somebody to take care of you. Let me be that person.\" So,nhis parents had died. He knew what she was going through. Maybe thisnwas what she needed at this point in time. Maybe he could help herngrieve. \"Promise me you won't pressure me into anythingnelse? No sleepwalking? Lucy and Lois can come over for sleepovers?n\" Linda had this way of saying yes in a very round aboutnmanner. He knew what she was leading up to. \"Lock yourndoor if you want to be extra safe when you are here. You can donanything you want my Karalinda. This is your house just as it isnmine. \" he told her before kissing her deeply. Theirnarms locked in a tight embrace. Their lips met and their sensesnfilled with a need to just surrender to the moment. Neither of themnseemed to notice as their bodies sank onto the bed. The alarmnwent off on the watch at that very moment. Bringing Linda to hernsenses, she pushed Ethan away. \"We've got 30 minutes to get backnto the school.\" She got up and headed down the stairs.nSomehow Ethan seemed glued to the bed and unable to move. He sanknonto the bed instead. \"Let's go.\" shenhollered. \"Coming!\" he answered breathing heavily.nHe rolled off the bed and walked in a hunched over manner to covernwhat was going between his legs. Henhad a yearning for Linda that he knew she would not submit to at thatnmoment. However, he knew that such a time would eventually come andnwhen it did, it would be on Linda's terms. ********** \"Hendid what??? And you accepted???\" Lucy screamed when Linda showednher the key to the house. \"What's wrong with it?\"nLinda asked as she changed into her nightshirt. \"I can'tneven begin... and Clark said yes!\" Lucy was exasperated at bothnof them. She did not know who was dumb and dumber between the twonsuper cousins. \"But I won't be sleeping there alone withnhim. We can make it like our own fortress of solitude. Like thenclubhouse we have here in school. We can chill and hang around.\"nLinda explained trying to hide her fear at the reaction of hernfriend. \"My parents are not going to like this the leastnbit.\" Lucy told her as she got under the covers. \"Thenhouse is 5 minutes away from yours. One minute by flight.\" \"Indon't know Linda. If I am too young for that kind of room matenarrangement, you are not just too young, but too stupid too.\" \"It'snEthan, not like I am rooming with a total stranger.\" Linda feltninsulted that Lucy would not trust Ethan the way she did. \"Inknow you love the guy Linda but you have to be very careful.\" \"Whatnis the worst he can do to me? You know I can take care of myself.\"nLinda discreetly reminded her that she was not just Linda but Kara,nthe Supergirl. \"Just promise me that you won't donanything stupid ok? If he does anything to make you feelnuncomfortable, you will hurl him all the way to the moon, never to benseen again?\" \"I'll make sure he lands in the PhantomnZone.\" she assured her friend as she turned out the lamp lightnon her bedside table. Shenfound herself having to fight off a sense of deep sadness and pain asnshe remembered that even the Phantom Zone was no more. It too hadnexploded and merged with the dust particles of the inner space wherenArgo City once stood.[Chapter 6] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain thenproperty of DC Comics, Inc.

The Housewarming The school week seemed to fly by sonfast for Linda. The classes in science, math, computers, and othernsubjects that she was forced to study now seemed so elementary tonher. Indeed, the lessons were only elementary lessons for Kryptoniannchildren and it was difficult for her to pretend that she did notnknow what the class was being taught. Although her equivalency examnindicated that she could readily move on to a college education,nClark has insisted that she finish her senior year in high schoolnbefore attending college. He said something about the final year ofnhigh school being the most memorable event in a human's life. As farnas Kara was concerned, she still had to find that memorablenevent. Her days were filled by running from class to classnwith Lucy, who was trying to help her make more friends with thenother girls while totally avoiding the path of Myra and Muffy sincenthey carried a grude against Linda for having stopped their plans tonknock out Lucy during their Phys. Ed. class 2 years ago. They seemednto always be following Linda around but they could never catch hernalone. If Linda was not with Lucy, she was in the school gardennwaiting for Ethan to drop by for his daily visits. This wasnthe first week-end Linda was going to spend at the house. She wasnthrilled at the idea of having a place to call home even though Lucynthought she was crazy to go into it. They even argued about it beforenLucy left the dorm for her parent's house \"You are crazynLinda, you can't just rush into decisions like this.\" Lucynwarned her as she helped her pack up her week-end study guides andnbooks. \"Lucy, you have to understand my situation. Younhave your parents and your home to go to when things get rough. Theynwill support you. Be there for you. You have a sanctuary to run tonwhen you feel like your world is crumbling and you are all alone.nClark, even though he is my cousin, barely knows me and is too busynwith his job and his own relationship to have to bother about mynproblems and worries. I don't have anyone else, I don't have anynplace else. Ethan is it for me. He wants to take care of me. What isnso hard to understand about that?\" she reasoned as she zipped upnher bookbag and placed it near the door with her overnight bag. \"Inam just saying Linda, you have barely been here a month and the firstnthing you did was shack up with your boyfriend. It isn't done.\"nLucy pretended to be busy packing her own overnight bag asnwell. \"What would you have me do Lucy? Where would I go thisnweekend? Back to your house? Stay with your parents? I had parentsnLucy. They are gone now and they raised me to know how to take carenof myself. Don't you think Clark would have said no if it was anreally bad idea?\" \"Clark is not 17 Linda!\" \"Itnis not like I am, what did you say the tradition was called? It isnnot like I am marrying Ethan.\" \"And that is what Inhave a problem with! That is what most people will have a problemnwith when they find out that you are a 17 year old living with a 19nyear old guy! Nobody will ask if you sleep in separate rooms. Nobodynwill care. They will only see and understand what they want to seenand understand.\" \"What is the big deal? You saidnhaving room mates was normal.\" Linda was beginning to feelndistress at all the new social norms she was having to learn in thisnsociety. It seemed to her that everything she had done so far hadnbeen wrong and only upset her best friend each time she found outnwhat Linda was up to. \"Room mates Linda, means 2 boys orn2 girls in the same house. Not a teenage girl who has no parents butna guardian who seems to be more lost than you are with regards tonhuman ways, and a man who happens to be just above the legal age.nThat totally changes the equation.\" \"I have a hardntime understanding this concept. It is alright for me to fall in lovenwith Ethan but it is not alright for me to stay in the same house? Ifnthat is so, then why am I allowed to fall in love with him? How comenwe can go out on dates and nobody minds? \" Linda was close tonthe breaking point. She felt a headache coming on as she tried tonforce herself to process the information that only left her with morenquestions than answers. \"Relationships are complicatednhere on earth Linda. It is something you will have to learn aboutnover time.\" \"Lucy, your car is here.\" Mrs.nMurray's voice over the intercome interrupted theirnconversation. The friends looked at each other without sayingna word. Neither of them wanting to say something the other mightnregret. \"I'll see you on Monday.\" Lucy told hernfriend as she headed out the door. Linda closed the doornbehind her and looked out the window, waiting for the familiar sightnof Ethan on his motorcycle. Tears were starting to swell out of herneyes. ********** Ethan noticed that Linda was listlessnwhen they finally got back to the house. Whatever it was that wasnbothering her left her so preoccupied that she did not even noticenthat he was taking a shower when she came into the bathroom to set upnher toiletries. Ethan had this habit of taking a portable radio tonthe shower with him. He liked to listen to music and sing along as henscrubbed himself off. It was no wonder that he did not hear thendoorknob turn and the door open. \"Linda!\" He shoutednwhen he opened the curtains and saw her standing at the bathroomncabinet, her back turned to him. He almost slipped on the wetnpavement as he grabbed for his towel to cover himself up. \"Huh?nEthan? Ethan!\" she glanced behind her, froze at the sight of hisnnaked body before her then realized what she was seeing. She turnednon her heels in a hurry. She dropped the bag of toiletries on thenfloor and ran out of the room. Burning with some sort of feeling thatnshe could not explain. So that was what he looked likenunderneath the clothes. Why did she suddenly feel strange? What wasnthis urge that seemed to suddenly have built up inside of her at thensight of Ethan in a state of undress? She could not decide if it wasna good or bad feeling, or even if she should act upon what was slowlynbecoming an impulse within her. What was going on within her? Wasnthis desire she was feeling a human or Kryptonian emotion? How couldnshe tell the difference? Was there a difference? Was she becomingnmore human now and less Kryptonian? She shuddered at the idea ofnlosing her Kryptonian heritage and becoming almost all human likenKal-El. She was not ready to let go of that which made her uniquenjust yet. She could not explain why she started to smile atnthe thought of what had just happened. She went into her room andnlocked the door behind her. The feeling seemed to be growing intenseninside her. What was she feeling? Maybe Lois could tell her what thisnwas all about. Or maybe not. The last thing she needed was anothernLane mad at her. There was a knock on the door. \"Linda,nopen up. It's me.\" Ethan was now fully clothed withndripping wet hair. She had run out of the bathroom so fast that henwas absolutely sure she used super speed. If he was right about hisnsuspicions, he had to explain some things to her. She openednthe door just a crack. \"Sorry. I did not mean to walk in onnyou.\" \"My fault. I should have locked the door. Arenyou done unpacking? Do you need any help?\" \"I'mnalmost done. What time is it?\" \"3:30. Let me in. Wenhave to talk about what just happened.\" \"Ethan, it'snalright. There is nothing to explain. I understand human anatomy.nAlthough, this is the first time I've seen a man in without thenclothes on. \" She was already used to seeing other women innvarious states of undress over at their dorm. The female anatomy was of no big dealnto her after discovering that the female human and Kyrptonian femalenanatomy were not different from each other in terms of looks becausenof her dorm mates. From what she had studied and seen in the books ofnKryptonian Anatomy, the human male was no different either. Annawkward pause followed. \"I'll just remember to tell younif I'm gonna use the shower. And, I'll remember to lock the door.\"nhe told her. \"Okay. go on down. I will just finish upnhere then we can head out for dinner ok?\" she chose to ignorenwhat had happened earlier since she saw no point in discussing it.nShe figured that if they were both careless with their bathroomnduties, accidents like that would always happen between them so therenwas no need to blow it out of proportion. \"Yeah. Right.nDinner.\" he said sheepishly. He did not know to treat her. Shenwas the first woman he ever met who did not consider what happened asnan invitation to something more intimate. ********** \"Thisnisn't the way to the Promenade.\" she shouted over the roar ofnthe engine as they sped towards the town proper of Midvale. \"No,nit isn't. There is some place we have to go first.\" he hollerednback at her. They turned onto the parking lot that had thensign \"Honest Abe's Used Cars\" towering over it. \"Arenyou getting a car?\" she asked him after he had parked thenmotorcyle. \"We are getting a car. Linda, remember this,nthere is no you and I, there is only us. There is only we.\" hentouched his thumb to her upper lip to remind her of what they meantnto each other. Her skin tingled at his touch. She sighed inncontentment. She could not ask for more out of her new life. She hadna man who loved her and cared for her and she had Clark and the Lanesnto call her family. \"But what for? We have thenmotorcycle.\" \"Well, I can't keep picking you up innthis. I barely got your overnight bag to stay on. A car would also bena more comfortable ride for you when you prefer not to fly.\" henwinked at her. Anchoring an arm around each other's waist,nthey made their way to the display lot. An hour later, they drove offnin a Volkswagon GTI. ********** \"We need to stopnby the grocery and pick up some food.\" She told Ethan afterntheir meal. Much as she liked eating out, she never forgot what Lucyntold her. That men like having women cook for them. After everythingnEthan had done for her, it was the very least she could do fornhim. \"Can you cook?\" he asked her, somehow he sawnher flipping a pancake and sending it through the roof instead ofnimagining what her cooking would taste like. \"We willnfind out.\" she teased him. She wondered if it would be possiblento duplicate a typical Kryptonian meal on earth. Well, whatever, shenwould have to learn to cook because the expense of eating out everynweek-end was something she did not relish since Ethan refused to letnher go dutch. Clark had given her some money the last time they werentogether and he told her to use it whenever she needed to. But Ethanntold her that taking care of her meant he spent for whatever they didntogether. Eating being one of those things they didntogether. ********** There was a strange buzzing soundnthat threatened to wake Kara up from her deep slumber the next day.nWhat was that offensive noise? Was that Kal-El she heard downstairs?nWhatever, she was too sleepy to find out. Ethan had kept her up halfnthe night regaling her with stories of his childhood which shencountered with her own stories. It was almost daybreak when they madentheir way up to their respective rooms. \"Linda, wake up.nYou need to come down. We have guests.\" Ethan knocked on herndoor. He tried the handle but it was locked. Kicking off herncovers she got up and opened the door. \"Who is it?\" \"Younwon't believe me if I told you. Just get dressed okay?\" Ethannhad not planned on having a housewarming party and had no idea thatnClark and Lois had prepared a surprise for them for their firstnweek-end at their new house. \"Fine.\" she yawned.nShe made her way to the shower with her eyes still halfnclosed. ********** As she took her shower, her supernhearing kicked into gear and she heard Lois and Clark downstairs.nSomebody was cooking in the kitchen and Jimmy was making somethingncalled O.J. \"There you are!' Lois greeted her when shenfinally made it downstairs. \"Hi Lois! What's up?\"nLinda greeted her. \"What's up? What does it look like?\"nLois smiled at her. \"You making breakfast.\" Therenwas that sound again. She wished it would go away. \"Doorbell.nGet the door Linda.\" Lois told her almost as if she guessed thatnthe noise was puzzling her. \"Hey there girl!\" Lucyngreeted her with a casserole pot in her hands. \"Lucy,nwhat are you doing here? I thought you were mad at me?\" \"C'monnnow. You're my little sister. I could never stay mad at you. Get thisncrack pot into the kitchen. I have to help mom and dad with theirnhousewarming gift.\" \"Housewarming?\" \"It'sna human thing. A new house always needs a party. Coming mom!\"nLucy turned and walked back to her parent's car. \"BTW,nLois told our folks, they are cool with it.\" \"Okaynwith it? They don't think I am doing something scandalous like younsaid?\" \"Nope. They figure if Clark gave his consentnthen there must be something to it. Besides, they promised Lois andnClark that we will look out for you on week-ends. By the way, did younknow that you can legally get married if Clark signs a consent formnfor you?\" she teased her friend as she walked backwards towardsnher parents, almost slipping off the first step. \"Lucy, Inalready told you...\" \"Hey no pressure on you two. Inknow you will both do the right thing. I'm just putting it out there.nGotta look out for my sis.\" she smiled then turned and ran tonthe car.[Chapter 7] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain thenproperty of DC Comics, Inc.

Troubled Hearts Frostee'snhad not changed much physically since she last worked there. Therenwere new employees working with Lucy whom Linda had to get to knownbut everything was still pretty much the same. Dean was still inncharge and pretending to be as strict as possible. Lucy told her thatnhis family owned the restaurant now and Dean was almost unbearable asnan employer because of it. But Lucy never quit because the place paidnwell and her parents, who raised her as an army brat, believed thatnshe had it within her to learn from this work experience. So far allnshe had learned was that she wanted to give Dean a fat lip each timenher ordered her around as if she were a foot soldier. The twonL's are Dean called them collectively were working different shiftsnat the food joint. Lucy had the afternoon shift which began at 3nevery afternoon and ended at 6. Linda had the evening shift thatnstarted at 6 and ended at 9. Ethan would often pick her up after worknand take her home to the dorm except on Friday nights when they wentnhome to the house. Linda had already cleaned the restuarantnand refilled all the dispensers that night. Ethan usually arrivednaround 8:30 and waited for her shift to end but he was late gettingnto her for some reason. It was already 9:30 and there was still nonsign of him. The only other person left at the place was Dean who wasnbusy working on the day's sales report. He invited her to sit withnhim while she waited. This was the first time that Dean everngot to spend any relaxation time with any of his employees. As Lindansat infront of him reading his charts, she pointed out hisncalculation mistakes to him which left him astonished. She was doingnit all without the aid of a calculator and she did not even know thenformula he was using and yet she got all the answers right when hencomputed it himself. Setting aside his work for the night, he decidednthat he should get to know this bright young woman, after all, theynwere of the same age and would probably be hanging out as friends ifnthings had been different. Kal-El had helped Linda come upnwith a plausible story for her background in case anybody asked her.nHer parents were to have died in a plane crash that left her as thenward of her cousin Clark. The rest of her story, about coming to livenin Midvale to study, was all true. \"You're a strange onenLinda Lee.\" Dean said as he sat fascinated by her story and whatnhe noticed now, were he intoxicating blue eyes. She smiled andnacknowledged him. The alarm on her watch reminded her of the time.nWhere was Ethan? Dean took the chance to tell her all aboutnhimself next. Linda could not help but compare the background ofnEthan and Dean. One brought himself up in life and the other hadneverything handed to him because his family was rich. He wanted thisnrestaurant so his family bought it for him. He also had lofty dreamsnthat he convincingly talked about. \"Eventually, I plan tonattend the Harvard Business School and get my degree in Management. Inthink it will come in handy when I start to expand.\" he relatednwhile he offered to refill her soda glass from the dispenser. \"Sonyou have plans to leave Midvale?\" she asked. \"Eventually.nI mean, what kind of loser would want to spend his whole life in thisnhum drum town? Nothing ever happens here. Except for those few timesnSupergirl was around.\" He recalled Kara's past 2 visits withoutnrealizing that Supergirl was sitting right in front of him. Ethannseemed like he had no plans of leaving Midvale, did that make him anloser? What did Ethan have planned for his future? Was the gardeningnit for him? Nothing more? Would she be stuck in the dead end town asnwell? \"What's going on in that pretty head of yours?\"nDean complimented her in such a way that she felt herselfnblushing. \"I was just wondering about some things thatnwould probably bore you.\" she looked outside the glass door andnused her distance vision to see the Volkswagon finally making itsnapproach. \"I better get my stuff together. Ethan will benhere any minute now.\" she got up from her chair and headed fornthe locker room. Ethan was rapping on the glass door when shengot back. He watched from the other side as Linda said goodnight tonher boss. Dean did something strange that night that bothered Ethan.nHe gave her a goodbye kiss on the cheek. He could not understand whynLinda allowed it. She was his girl. Or did she not understand whatnthat meant? \"What happened to you?\" she asked himnwith great concern. His face was still red with jealousy. \"Carnproblems. I would have called but I figured Dean would not let youncome to the phone.\" He explained. ********** \"Willnyou let it go Ethan? Please. I am tired and all I want to do is go tonbed right now.\" she pleaded with him as they walked into thenhouse. He had been badgering her with questions since she gotninto the car. What was it that was so wrong with allowing Dean tongive her a buss on the cheek? Even Mr. Lane gave her a kiss on thencheek and he never acted so jealous before. \"You justndon't get it do you Linda? You are my girl. My girlfriend. You havencertain duties and responsibilities. You have to act a certainnway!\" \"No Ethan. I don't get it. You will have tonexplain it to me.\" she answered as she put her things on thenshelf near the entryway. She headed straight to the couch to rest herntired feet. If only Ethan were not too busy picking a fightnwith her he would have noticed that she was feeling tired. Somethingnthat was not common to Super beings. Linda knew that there wasnsomething emotionally wrong with her. But she did not have theninclination to bring it up with Ethan at the time. She just wantednhim to leave her alone. \"I am going to my room now.\"nshe told him. Leaving him to vent and seethe on hisnown. ********** Over the next few weeks, Ethan observednthe change in the employer-employee dynamic between Linda and Dean.nAll her stories were now punctuated with quotes from Dean and what hensaid and did or whatever. It was driving him up the wall withnjealousy. Dean was competition and he was stealing away his girl, andnLinda did not realize it. Everything came to a head betweennLinda and Ethan the day that she told him to go home instead ofnpicking her up after work. She had accepted an invitation to have ansnack after work from Dean. \"You don't go around havingndinner with other guys when you have a boyfriend!\" he scoldednher over the phone when she called him at his office to tellnhim. \"He's not a guy, he's my boss.\" Lindanreasoned. \"Is Lucy coming with you?\" \"No.\" \"Thennit's a date Linda. \" \"It's just one meal Ethan. Ansnack. Don't read anything into it!\" she was shouting into thenphone already. Linda was sick and tired of spending the past monthnhaving to defend her friendship with Dean. Lucy encouraged thenfriendship because she said that Linda needed to meet other mennbefore settling down with just one for the rest of her life. Withoutntelling her, Lucy was secretly hoping that Linda would go out withnDean when he asked her. Her friend needed to learn how to play thenfield before settling down. \"Ethan, this is not a date.nIt does not entail the same preparations I do when we go out.\"nshe tried to hold her temper in and lwoer her voice as the othernemployees began to look in her direction because of her loudnvoice. \"You don't have to do all those things for me whennwe go out.\" \"But I want to. Lucy said I need to upnthe beauty factor with you.\" \"Beauynfactor?\" \"Nevermind.\" \"Look, justntell me where you guys will at least be so I can pick you up.\" \"Thatnwon't be necessary. Dean said he would drop me off at home.\" Wasnhe planning to size up his competition? Ethan made just one requestnof Linda before he conceded his stand. \"Tell him you arenalready in a relationship with a wonderful guy who is crazy about younalright?\" \"I think he can already tell that.\"nhe could not see her smiling at the thought on the other end of thenline. ********** He was like a nervous father waitingnfor his daughter to come home from her date that night. He hadnwatched all the cable show there were and drank all the juice withinnthe house. He wished he had stashed away some beer but Linda wasnagainst his drinking habit after she found out that he had become annalcoholic after she left him for the first time. As he thought aboutnwhat else he could do to stay awake while waiting, he saw headlightsnshine against their front door. He looked out the window and saw anstylish 1986 Honda Acura pull up. Watching them through thenfront door peephole, he suddenly opened the door when he saw Lindanrelax on the porch and Dean sit on the steps talking to her with hisnback turned. With the green eyed monster getting his way, he pushednDean from the back, causing him to fall forward on the steps. \"Ethannstop!\" Linda cried out in surprise. \"Stay away fromnmy girl man!\" he shouted at Dean who turned and tried to throw anpunch at Ethan. Linda placed herself between the two men. Shenbegged Ethan to go back in to the house. \"Get him out ofnhere.\" Ethan snarled slamming the door behind him. Shenstood frozen in her spot for a moment. Ethan had never been like thisnwith her. What had she done to make him so mad? \"Are younalright?\" she turned to Dean who was picking himself up off thenground after Ethan's second punch to his jaw made contact. \"I'mnfine. I think you better go in and talk to him.\" Dean was tryingnto shake off the pain he felt by rotating his lower jaw around. \"Younneed help.\" He smiled at her. How he wished she were notnin this undefined relationship with Ethan. That way he could have anchance at winning her over. She told him all about it during theirnmeal and seeing how caring she was right now, made him realize evennmore what a lucky man Ethan was to have her. \"I'll benfine. Now go.\" he told her. ********** He alreadynhad his house and motorcyle keys in hand when she came into the door.nHe was standing beside their brick-a-brack shelf that held their keysnand other small items. \"Ethan, we need to talk.\" shentold him. \"I don't want to talk. Not right now Linda.\"nhe told her as he started towards the door. \"Ethan...\" \"Don'tnwait up for me. I don't know if I will be back tonight.\" henwarned her as he slammed the door a second time in hernface. ********** Linda lay in bed awake that night.nListening for signs that he was finally home. She heard the birdsnbeginning to wake up. The sun was slowly creeeping into hernwindow. \"Isn't your heart at home here anymore?\" shencried silently as she realized that he had not been home all night.nHe had left her alone. The last thing that she ever wanted to be.nWhat had she done? Was it wrong to have other male friends aside fromnhim? Why? Shenneeded to understand. She needed someone to talk to. She was alonenwith nobody to turn to. Clark was on assignment with Lois and Lucynwas at her parent's house. Flying over to her would not be a goodnidea at 2 in the morning. She would wake the whole household and itnwas bad enough that they did not trust Ethan to do right by her inntheir current set up. She did not want to damage him in their eyes. \"My heart can't be at home anywhere without you Ethan.nPlease come back. I need you. I love you.\" she whispered softly.nHer tears stained the pillow that her head rested upon.[Chapter 8] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Time for breakfast.\" Jimmy threw his wet bath towelnat the figure sleeping on his couch. Ethan stirred but did notnopen his eyes. He came over to Jimmy's from the house looking fornbeer. Something that Jimmy had in stock, well, not much of afternEthan and he were done. He heard a phone ringing somewhere in thenhouse. \"He's here. I'll take care of everything.\" henheard Jimmy say. Who was that? Linda? Lucy? \"Yo Ethan!nEggs and bacon on the stove now! Piping hot coffee in the pot. Getnup!\" Ethan mumbled something but still continuednsleeping. The next thing he knew, he felt his face getting splashednwith ice cold water. His shirt was dripping wet. He choked as thenwater entered his nose. \"Now that I have yournattention...\" Jimmy said holding a dry towel out to his soppingnwet friend and placing the drinking glass on the coffee table. \"Man,nI was going to get up in 5 minutes.\" Ethan complained as hendabbed his face dry. \"Linda is worried sick. Why did younstorm out on her like that? That was not cool Ethan.\" Jimmynstood up and got two TV trays from behind his bookshelf. Jimmy'snapartment looked a lot like Ethan's old pad with the exception thatnLucy had declared war on the disarray that existed and set out tonorganize everything in the house. She was about halfway done at thisnpoint and the woman's touch in the place was becoming evident. \"Intold you, I was jealous. That Dean is bad news.\" he got up andnheaded to the small kitchen to pour himself some coffee. \"Lindanis worried sick Ethan. She has called everybody you bothnknow.\" \"Good. Let her worry.\" \"Ethan...\" 'MaybenDean can help her find me. She did not even fly after me ! That saysna lot about how seriously she is taking this relationship.\" thenjealousy in his voice was quite evident. He picked up the coffee andnimmediately scalded his tongue. \"Serves you right. \"nJimmy replied with sarcasm. \"Whose side are you on?\"nhe asked Jimmy. \"Neither. Look, you have to understandnsomething. Linda is new to everything happening around her. Shendoesn't know anybody except us. Why deny her the right to make newnfriends?\" \"Dean is jockeying for more thannfriendship.\" he stabbed the bacon with his fork to make ansandwich. the meat fell off and he had to stab it a few times beforenstayed on. Jimmy set up his own table and sat across from hisnfriend. Wondering what had happened to the Ethan who would give upnhis life for Linda. He hoped that he would never be that way withnLucy. \"It's bacon Ethan. Don't take your jealousy out onnit.\" Jimmy reminded him as he cracked his sunny side up egg withnhis slice of bread. \"Ethan, go home. Talk to Linda. Thisnis not the time to zone out. Whatever the problem is, work itnout.\" ********** \"Linda, are you alright?\"nLucy was worried when she arrived at Linda and Ethan's place with thenfront door unlocked. Her friend was sitting on the couchnlooking like she had been crying all night. She had gone downstairsnto try and wait up for Ethan as the sun began to come up. It wasnevident that he was not coming back to the house anytime soon so shengot on the phone calling everyone she knew the minute her wrist watchnbeeped 9 AM. The usual wake up time at the dorm. Lucy hadnbarely sat down when Linda threw herself crying into the arms of hernfriend. \"He left me Linda. He promised me he would never donthat! He said it would always be us could he have liednto me? \" \"Wait a minute. Get a hold of yourselfngirl. Start at the top. What happened? Who left?\" Lucy drove outnto the house when she heard Linda sobbing and talking incoherently onnthe phone. No questions were necessary between the two women whonconsidered each other sisters. When one of them needed help, thenother would definitely come. \"Ethan. Last night. I camenhome with Dean after dinner and we were sitting outside talking thennEthan stormed out and punched Dean in the jaw.\" \"Younwent out? On a date? With Dean? Are you crazy! You have a boyfriend!nto make it worse, you brought Dean back here! \" Lucy scoldednher. \"Why do you and Ethan keep calling calling it andate? We had dinner, we talked. We are friends. We forgot the time sonhe took me home because it was late and I wasn't just about to flynoff and let him know who I really am. Besides, Clark told me tonalways bring my friends home. This is my home. I brought my friendnhome. That was all I did!\" \"Linda, at a certainnpoint, you and Ethan will have to sort out this living arrangement.nThis will get far more complicated in the future. As for Dean, I knewnsomething was wrong when he started calling you Linda Lee at work asnif it meant something to him.\" Lucy recalled. She had hernsuspicions about Dean trying to strike up a relationship of sortsnwith Linda but never thought that Linda was actually encouragingnit. \"We don't have a relationship!\" Linda insisted.nShe got up from the couch and headed to the kitchen. She poured somenorange juice into two glasses and offered one to Lucy who hadnfollowed her. \"Did you tell Dean that? Have you toldnEthan that? Linda, this is exactly why I did not want you to move innwith Ethan.\" Lucy was just plain exasperated with her friendsninnocence now. Shenknew that Linda would be attracted to other men eventually and shenhad hoped that she would be able to help her friend learn how to playnthe field. Instead, Linda got deeper and deeper into a relationshipnshe did not understand. \"He did not want to talk. Get thencheese and butter from the fridge will you please? \" Lindananswered. She put the glass down and brought out the loaf bread fromnthe bread box. \"Do you know where he is right now? Wenshould go to him. You two need to straighten this out.\" Lucynsuggested as she opened the fridge. A thought suddenlynoccurred to Lucy, \"Why didn't you fly after him?\" \"Thenway he looked at me last night, the anger and hurt in his eyes...nsomehow I knew that the last person he wanted to see or talk to wasnKara.\" she replied as she continued to fix their cheesensandwiches. They were halfway through their breakfast whennLinda's super hearing heard the approaching roar of Ethan'snmotorcycle. \"He's here.\" He entered through thenkitchen door and saw the two women finishing up their meal. \"HeynLucy! Think you can give us some privacy after you finish?\" \"Nonproblem. I was just leaving.\" Lucy gathered her keys from thentable and motioned to Linda to talk to him as shenleft. ********** They sat across from each other at thendining table. Looking deeply into each others eyes, they both knewnthat somebody had to say the first word but neither of them seemed tonwant to take the step. Why was it so hard for them to talk to eachnother now? \"Ethan, I...\" Linda began but he held upnhis hand to interrupt her. \"You did not do anything wrongnLinda. I spent the night at Jimmy's and we talked. I understand now.nI was wrong. I forgot that you need to make other friends. I forgotnthat you would not have brought Dean to the house if you did notnconsider him a friend. He is somebody I should have considered anfriend too.\" \"Why did you hit him Ethan? That wasnnot necessary. I told you, it was an innocent dinner. Betweennfriends.\" He sighed and moved his chair closer to her. Itnwas somehow very important for him to see the look in her eyes whilenhe explained himself. \"I'm crazy in love with you Linda.nI thought I was losing you.\" \"Losing me?\" thenwonder that filled her eyes pained him. He never realized how wrongnhe was about everything until that very moment. \"I wasnjealous. Look, who wouldn't be? Dean is a businessman whom everybodynin town knows has a chance to go off to the big city and study atnsome big fancy college. He can be somebody. I am just a gardener. Incan't offer you anything else but what I already have. I can'tncompete.\" \"Oh Ethan!\" she cried as she pullednhim closer to her. Hugging him tightly. \"How could you benso insecure? Remember what I told you? Remember who owns this?\" shenplaced his hand over her heart. \"Whyncouldn't you trust in what we have. When I went back to Argo City, Inplaced my trust in our love. That you would wait for me and continuento love me even if I was not around to keep you reassured of how Infeel for you. Why couldn't you trust in my love for you the samenway?\" she asked. \"Linda, I am only human. I haventhoughts, emotions, and impulses that you won't alwaysnunderstand.\" \"But I am willing to learn andnunderstand. If you would only talk to me instead of hitting peoplenand storming out, you could teach me about how a relationship works.nWhat you expect of me, how I should act. I could tell you how I feelnabout things. You scared me last night when you left and said younwere not coming back.\" she answered as he pulled away fromnher. \"You told me that home is where the heart is. Whennyou left last night and did not come back, I wondered if your heartnno longer felt at home here. I thought you were not going to comenback to me. You are my home Ethan. My home is always going to benwhere ever you are. With you I feel safe. I take security in the lovenyou offer me. Your understanding and care is my protection on thisnstrange planet.\"her voice cracked as she tried to explain tonhim. But he chose to turn away from her. He wasn't going tonlook at her. He was not going to weaken. But his heart won over hisnmind once more. Within him, he knew that she had a lifetime to learnneverything that would make her human. Clarknhad warned him about it before giving his blessing to the room matenset up. He thought he could handle it. Clark knew all the human ways.nHe was practically human since he grew up on Earth. Kara on the othernhand, what she knew, all that she knew about life would be useless tonher now. She would need help in easing into the norms of her new homenplanet. She was sure to stumble and fall along the way, but she wouldnlearn from it. After all, that is what made everybody human, learningnfrom mistakes. Now he had to prove to Clark and Lois, and anyone elsenwho told Linda that they thought this set up was a mistake or wouldnnot work that he was in this with her for the long haul. That wasnwhat their love was all about. Turning once again to face her,nhe saw her crying like a child. Wiping her eyes and nose with hernhands. \"You will never lose me Linda.\" \"Thennpromise me you will never do that again. Promise me! My heart is atnat home only where it knows you will also be. \" she was gaspingnfor breath between sobs. He slowly raised his thumb to hernlower lip. Her lips felt soft and supple at his touch. Her stiff andnnervous body almost immediately relaxed as he wrapped an arm aroundnher. He began slowly circling her lips with his thumb before touchingnhis lips to her now closed and wet eyelids. \"No morentears my Karalinda. No more tears. This will never happennagain.\" Instinctively, Linda's own fingers searched fornhis lips to caress before submitting her own lips to his tearsnflavored lips. They let the answering machine answer thenringing phone. \"Kara. It's Kal-El. Pick up the phone.\"ncame her cousin's voice over the speaker. Ethan relaxed hisngrip to let her go. \"I have to take this.\" she toldnhim as she let go of him and went to take the call.[Chapter 9] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Kara Comes Of Age Kal-El had flown to the Fortress Of Solitude in order to get away from his mankind protection duties for a while. The problem he had with living in Metropolis was that crime never seemed to take a rest so that between his crime fighting and reporter duties, he never had a moment of peace. The fortress was the only place on the planet that provided that for him. One of his favorite past - times while he was there was to review the crystals that Jor-El had placed into his crystal pod when he was jettisoned to earth as a child. This was how he learned about the traditions and culture of a race that was now extinct save for him and Kara's existence. He had been reviewing some of the crystals that Kara had taken to earth with her. So far he seemed to be learning more about the social rituals of Krypton and how their traditions were carried out. One crystal showed how Kara, as a child, was baptized as the Princess of the House Of El. She was probably around 6 years old and was participating in the dressing ceremony headed by her mother. There was Alura changing her clothes to the burlap looking white gown that females under the age of 17 wore on Krypton. Later on, he found the crystal recording showing the dress ceremony of Kara during her coming of age, this time, she dressed herself in the white gown while Alura and Zor-El looked upon her with pride in their eyes. According to what he had watched, Kara was now officially one of the young leaders of Argo City. If Argo City had not exploded, she was in line to become the one of the city leaders and sit on the Elder Council because she was the only remaining member of the House of El in their location. Kal-El was ready to turn in for the night and had just lowered the power within the fortress when he saw a bright pink glow emanating from one of Kara's crystals. Curiousity getting the better of him, he took the crystal out and inserted it into the viewer. A shot of pink light darted out of the crystal tip and filled the room with its color, blinding Kal-El for a moment. He needed a few minutes to adjust to the new color in the fortress. As he blinked to remove the glare, the familiar voice of Zor-El reached his ears. There standing before him were Alura and Zor-El. He knew it was a recording emanating from the crystal. He was sad that Kara was not there to witness this. \"Kal-El, if you are watching this, that means that Argo City has seen its destruction and Kara is now in your care. Therefore, there are a few things you need to know. \" Zor-El seemed to be looking at him directly. \"This crystal was designed to glow on the day that Kara is to turn 18 by human years. Our research has shown that this is an important age for earthings and is part of their development process. Kryptonian age is calculated by a different formula and therefore, even though Kara is only 17 by our standards, she actually turns 18 within 2 Earth months.\" Zor-El continued. \"We would like Kara to experience this human tradition. We beg you to see to it that she has a debut party worthy of the Princess Of The House Of El. She will have plenty more to learn before actually becoming a human being such as you have become due to your exposure on earth. Assist her during this important first step.\" Alura explained. \"We trust that as her guardian, you will know how to do this and explain this tradition to her. Do not fail us Kal-El.\" Zor-El ended as the figures began to fade away. \"Oh great! Lois better know how to do this because I sure don't know what to do.\" he told himself as he set aside the crystal. He would deal with it in the morning. ********** \"But I don't want to have a party Kal-El! I don't even know what a debut is all about.\" Kara protested while she was seated in Kal-El's apartment in Metropolis. He had asked her to fly there after her classes in order to tell her what her parents had asked him to do. \"Kara, we have to do it. Your parent's want you to do it. We must honor it.\" he explained to her while he cleaned his glasses. \"I realize that. It is just that...\" \"I've spoken to Lois and Lucy. They are more than happy to help us organize everything. The Lanes have volunteered to host the party at their house.\" he was not going to let Kara talk him out of this. Somehow, her presence in his life had struck a caring cord within him that he could not explain. Just as Ethan took care of her, he too cared for her like the sister he never had. Over the months, she had come to blossom in front of him. But the fact that she refused to talk to him about what she saw during the demise of Argo City bothered him. He was sure that she needed to talk about it but chose to ignore it instead. The door to the apartment opened. \"Where's the debutante? We have a lot of work to do if we are doing this in a week. \" Lois asked excitedly as she came into the room. \"A week?!\" Kara looked at Kal-El with an incredulous look on her face. There as absolutely no way this was happening in a week's time. \"So, I talked to the press that prints invitations for our family occassions and I got them to agree to a rush print job for the debut. How many will we be needing?\" She asked Kara. \"Do we know if you will have a gown made or are you buying one off the rack?\" \"I have no idea about anything you are asking me. \" Kara hoped that these people knew what they were doing. ********** \"Will I be needing a tux?\" Ethan asked her after she told him of the debut preparations. \"What's a tux?\" she asked. They were cooking spaghetti in their small kitchen and were constantly bumping into each other. \"Formal menswear for parties like that.\" he explained. \"I dunno. I guess so.\" she replied as she held up the sauce laddle for him to taste. \"More salt.\" he brushed her cheek softly with his arm as he reached for the salt dispenser on the shelf. \"You don't seem excited about this.\" he told her. \"I am Ethan. It's just that...\" He looked at her when she suddenly went quiet. \"I wish my parents were here. Clark said this was a big deal among earth parents and their daughters. I just wish...\" her voice cracked and she immediately dabbed the corners of her eyes to stop the tears. Taking off the cooking gloves, he pulled her into his arms and just held her. \"Let it out Linda. Cry if you want to.\" ********** \"So, I spoke to my mom and she says that we can use the car this week-end to find you the perfect gown. She already called her favorite botique and set up an appointment for us. What time should I pick you up?\" Lucy told Linda as they sat down to lunch at the school cafeteria. \"Your dad won't be driving us?\" Linda remembered that Mr. Lane drove them around the year before. Lucy was not allowed to drive at all. \"You kidding? I got my license last year after you left. I can drive wherever I want to now. It is kind of like flying for you.\" she whispered the last part to her friend. \"Oh. I see. So I could drive if I wanted to ?\" \"Sure. After you take lessons and pass the test.\" \"I think I will fly instead. Human's do too much studying for my taste.\" Linda joked as she ate the mashed potatoes on her plate. \"Ditto. Will you be eating that?\" Lucy agreed as she took the cupcake from Linda's lunch plate. ********** Linda knocked on Dean's office door before she left for the day. \"Come in.\" Dean acknowledged. \"Hi Dean.\" Linda greeted him upon entering the room. \"Linda, come in.\" he beamed at her. \"I don't want to bother you. I just want to drop this off. I hope you can come. All my friends are invited. \" she dropped the invitation on his desk. He picked it up and opened the envelope. He looked up at her and smiled. \"Got an escort yet?\" he had a mischevious gleam in his eyes. \"Ethan.\" she replied. \"Got room for one more?\" he asked hopefully. \"Nope. Just Ethan. Unless you want to get slugged again.\" she kidded him. He pretended to laugh at what she said. His jaw hurt for over a month and he could only sip soup for 2 weeks after that punch Ethan gave him. \"See you there.\" he told her. He was not going to force the issue. At least not yet. ********** Ethan had spent the whole week looking for the perfect gift for Linda. Whatever it was he gave her, it would have to be something she would treasure for the rest of their lives. What could it be? \"We've been walking for 4 hours now Ethan. Will you just pick something already.\" Jimmy complained as they rounded the mall for the 4th time that day. \"I don't know what to get her. What kind of gift can I give to Supergirl? \" Ethan admitted. \"Fer crying out loud Ethan, what is it that women love the most?\" Jimmy asked him to guess. Ethan looked at him blankly. \"Jewelry.\" Jimmy pointed at the display window of Stylus Jewellers. \"I need something for an 18 year old. Something that looks uncommon and special.\" he told the female jewelry store attendant. \"We just got something in today.\" the woman left the room and came back with a closed jewerly box. \"If your aren't on too tight a budget, this heart shaped Ruby gemstone with a Topaz insert silver necklace would make a wonderful gift. \" she continued her sales talk while the men looked at the necklace. Neither of the men actually understood what the woman was saying. The only thing that caught Ethan's attention were the colors of the stones. \"It looks expensive.\" Jimmy warned. \"Yeah. But Jimmy, look at the colors. It would actually mean something to her.\" Ethan hinted. \"Oh right...\" he replied remembering that the colors in front of him were the standard colors of both Superman and Supergirl. \"Do you take cards?\" Ethan asked the woman, dreading to hear the price. ********** Linda spent the day of the party at the Lane's house. Mrs. Lane insisted on hiring a professional hair stylist and make up artist for her while Lucy and Lois helped her get dressed. Things were so hectic that she forgot to have lunch. \"Drop the sandwich!\" Lois screamed when she saw Linda sneaking a snack in the kitchen. \"I haven't eaten all day Lois!\" Linda protested bringing the sandwich to her mouth. \"Do you want to fit into the gown or not?\" she grabbed the bread out of her hands and set it aside. \"Lois, this is me we are talking about.\" she tried to reason. \"I don't care. We will not risk you gaining even an inch before that dress is put on.\" \"Linda! Get up here. You can't eat with that make up on. You will ruin it! Wait till the party!\" she heard Lucy hollering from upstairs. Why were they more excited than she was? \"Coming Lucy.\" she dragged herself out of the kitchen and back up the stairs. ********** Linda was finally ready for the party. She was wearing a light pink, off the shoulder formal gown that Mrs. Lane helped her pick out. Her shoulders were clearly defined even though she never exercised as she had a typical Kryptonian female body structure. Her hair was set in a bun and held up by a bejeweled butterfly clip that Lois had lent her for the occassion. If only her parents could see her now. Her parents. She had been fighting the guilt that had been growing inside of her since Clark had told her about the party. It wasn't fair that they were no longer with her to enjoy this momentous occassion in her life. If it was so important, then they should have been there. They should have left Argo City with her. There was a knock on the door. \"Kara? Are you ready?\" Kal-El asked. \"Come in Kal-El.\" she pulled a tissue out of the box and blotted the tears before it could make her masacara run. \"It's time.\" he told her, his jaw dropping as she stood up and turned to him. \"You look exquisite Kara. A beautiful living doll.\" he complimented her as he offered his arm to her so he could escort her downstairs. \"Thank you Kal-El. Is Ethan here yet?\" she had not seen him since the day before because Mrs. Lane insisted she sleep at their house to save on travel and preparation time. \"He's downstairs waiting for us.\" *********** \"Ladies and gentlemen, students of the Midvale School of Girls, Principal Ed Danvers, it is my greatest pleasure to present to you, our debutante, Ms. Linda Lee, escorted by her cousin Clark Kent.\" she heard Mr. Lane introduce her while she and Kal-el waited for their cue to come down the stairs. Ethan immediately looked up the steps from the corner step where he was standing. He was not sure if it was just his eyes but Linda seemed to have been spotlighted by an almost heavenly glow. She looked so happy as she walked down the stairs. Her beauty filled the room much to the envy of her classmates and others there. There was only one word to describe the beauty that emanated from within her that night -- ethereal. She had her eyes locked upon him as she walked down the stairs. He was clean shaven and dressed in a rental tuxedo similar to Clark's. Where Clark looked like her respectable older brother, Ethan looked every bit the part of the young man who had captured a very special young lady's heart. Together, they looked very much like a youthful couple enjoying the love they shared together. Nothing else in the world existed for them except each other. \"Her official escort for the night...\" Mr. Lane continued. \"is Mr. Ethan Logan.\" The room filled with applause as Ethan and Linda worked the room to welcome the guests. \"Linda, I have never seen you more beautiful than you do tonight.\" he breathed his words into her ear as they made their way to the debutante's table. She squeezed his hand to let him know she heard what he said. The eyes that looked at him were filled with so much happiness that night. A far cry from the sadness that had existed just a week ago when she stood crying in their kitchen. ********** \"May I cut in?\" Dean asked while Clark and Linda shared a slow dance. \"Of course. But remember, she has a boyfriend.\" Clark warned him. \"Clark!\" Linda was officially embarassed. \"No worries.\" Dean assured him taking his place. Linda glanced in Ethan's direction and looked at him in a way that told him to back off. The last thing she wanted was for the male egos to ruin her night. \"Happy birthday Linda.\" He tried to kiss her again on the cheek but this time she avoided him. \"Dean, you are a very good friend.\" she began to explain. \"But I am with Ethan and I don't want to do anything to make him mad. He has accepted you as my friend. Please don't push it.\" \"But won't you even entertain the notion that you could love someone else?\" he asked her as they danced towards the door leading to the pool where others from her school were dancing. \"I can't Dean. I'm sorry. You can't understand our relationship.\" she tried to let him down easy as they got closer to the pool. \"Then at least stop teasing me and give me a kiss.\" he lunged for her lips. She pushed him away and turned to walk away from him. \"Oh no you don't!\" he grabbed her by the arm. With a burst of strength, she broke free of his grip and walked into the at Linda's table saw what happened. Jimmy held Ethan back from approaching Dean. \"Bad. idea.\" he warned. \"Let me handle this.\" Lucy told him. She got up and followed Linda who had gone up to the rooms. Lucy found her in her bedroom which they were using as the dressing room for the night. \"What happened back there?\" she asked. Linda was sitting infront of the dresser table and staring at herself. \"Lucy, you were right. I made a mistake thinking Dean was just a friend. He wants more. Something that I can't give him.\" Linda turned toward her friend and starting letting her hair out of the bun. \"The party isn't over Linda. You can't change your clothes yet.\" She approached her and fixed up the hair again. \"I'm not in the mood anymore. Dean will be causing problems and Ethan will need to be restrained again.\" she complained. \"How about if I talk Dean into leaving the party?\" Lucy suggested as she clipped the bun again. \"Isn't that rude?\" \"The beauty of owning the house the party is held in is that I can send the troublemakers 's go. You can stay at the table while I sort this out.\" she told Linda. Dean was dancing with a girl from Midvale School when Lucy found him. \"Dean, a moment please?\" She led him away from the dance floor and to an area where Linda could see them from the table. \"You have to leave Dean. You upset Linda with your actions.\" \"Upset her? She upset me! That flirt!\" \"Watch it Dean. You are on thin ice.\" \"Tell you friend I am not leaving and if her boyfriend doesn't like it, he can go jump in the lake.\" he started back to the dance floor. \"I'm warning you. Don't try to break them up.\" Lucy blocked his path. \"Who's gonna stop me from breaking them up?\" Ethan sneered as he pushed Lucy aside. Linda had heard enough. She decided that Kara needed to deal with Dean. Excusing herself from the table, she snuck into the bushes and set upward in flight. Kara rounded the sky over the Lane residence, picked out Dean from the crowd by sight and swooped down on him. Lifting him into the sky with her. \"What? Supergirl?\" he asked in disbelief. \"Dean, why can't you take no for an answer. Linda already told you she did not want to get serious with you. Why not just take the friendship she offers?\" \"Are you kidding? My parents own this town. There is no girl here that I can't have. \" he bragged. \"Well, Linda has made it clear that you can't have her. So deal with it.\" Kara said irritatedly. \"That's what you say. But I can change her mind.\" he replied overconfidently. \"Look, leave Linda and Ethan alone. They are my friends and if you do anything to ruin their relationship...\" \"Your friends? Since when? Nobody even knows who you are.\" he argued. \"Dean, just listen to me and back off. I won't be responsible for anything that happens next.\" Supergirl warned him. \"What will you do?\" he goaded her. \"This!\" she dropped him directly into the center of the swimming pool. Splashing water that thankfully did not wet too many guests. Hearing the splash in the pool, everybody rushed out of the house. \"Where's Linda?\" Clark asked after seeing Dean swimming to the steps of the pool. Lucy pointed upward to the sky to answer his question. \"Oh Kara.\" Clark muttered while holding back a laugh. Indeed, Kara looked every bit of a woman already but she was still a child at heart. This would be a long growing up process for her. Clark decided he would have to talk to her about how she used her powers from now on. ********** The party finally ended about 2 A.M. but Ethan and Linda had a small party of their own when they got back to their house. They were cuddling on the couch for a while before going up to their respective rooms. Linda was still very excited over the nights events and could not stop talking about it. Ethan had to produce the box that he had hidden in the pantry to make her keep quiet long enough for him to say what he needed to tell her. \"My gift has a personal meaning Linda. That's why I waited till now to give it to you.\" he told her producing the ribbon trimmed jewelry box. \"Ethan, you did not have to get my anything. You've done so much for me already.\" Linda tried to refuse the gift. \"Open it.\" he placed the box in her hands. And clasped her fingers over it. Smiling brightly at him, she tore open the wrapper and fumbled with the box till she found the clasp that unlocked to open it. \"It's wonderful!\" He took the necklace out of the box and clasped it around her neck. \"It is just something to remember this night by.\" He explained as she let the hair that she held up settle back down. \"I love it Ethan. I think I can guess why you picked the color gemstones and setting. I will always treasure it. Now I will always be reminded that your heart is always at home, here with me.\" she told him contendly as she sank into his loving arms.[Chapter 10] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain thenproperty of DC Comics, Inc.

The Proposal Monthsnpassed and seasons changed within Kara's life. She saw the springnthat gave birth to lovely flower blossoms and bright green leaves onntrees that came to full bloom during the summer. Then she experiencednthe dreary Fall weather that turned the tree leaves brown andncluttered their small backyard with leaves and branches at the end ofnits life. As the Winter season approached, Ethan marveled at how muchnhis life had changed during the time that Kara had become a permanentnfixture in it. He was a changed man because of her. His desirento make sure that she was cared for and never wanting taught him thenvalue of saving his money instead of spending it on vices like henused to. In all the time they had been together, he never once letnher spend on anything they needed. No matter how hard it was for himnto finance their needs. Somehow he always managed to provide. Maybenit was because Kara had no desire for things like the other women henknew. Maybe it was because she was really satisfied with what hencould provide. But there was still something missing. Thenpromise he made to honor the Kryptonian traditions in their set upnwas really beginning to get to him. He wanted more from her but wasnafraid of what she would do if he pressured her. She was not the kindnof girl one took lightly and played with. The more he learned aboutnher and their ways, the more he realized he had to do right by her ifnhe wanted to have more of her. As they prepared breakfast thatnmorning, he found himself staring at her more intently while shenprepared the coffee and he set the table. Had she blossomednovernight? She would be graduating from Midvale School that Summer.nMaybe the timing was just right? He was almost sure that he hadnanother visit to Clark in order. She set the coffee pot on thentable and sat down next to him. He watched her eat. Was now the rightntime? \"Don't be crazy Ethan. Everything has to be justnperfect when you do this.\" he told himself while he took a sipnof his coffee. Kara looked his way and smiled, offering him anplate of scrambled eggs. \"Deep thoughts?\" \"Justnthoughts of you.\" he lightly ran his finger on her cheek beforenhe took the plate. *********** \"Linda!nWait up!\" Lucy hollered in the dorm hall as she tried to catchnup with her friend. They had both just returned to the school afternthe week-end. \"Did you see the announcement?\" shenasked while Linda unlocked their room. \"Whatnannouncement?\" Linda pushed the door open and let Lucy go innfirst since she had more bags on hand. \"The ChristmasnDance. It's in 2 weeks. Then we have the rest of December off untilnfir first week of January for the holidays.\" \"Indon't know how to dance.\" she told Lucy while changing into morencomfortable clothes. \"You don't know how? Doesn't Ethannever take you out dancing? Wait a minute, you danced at your debutnand you were fine.\" Lucy reminded her. \"I lookednlike a headless chicken. Don't deny it. I saw the video.\" Lindanreplied cringing at the memory of her odd dance routine during hernparty. The guests were kind enough not to laugh at her. \"Well,nyou have to forget that and get ready. We are going to a ball. So younbetter tell Ethan to clear that Friday night and rent a tux. Tell himnJimmy is waiting for his call. They can get a 2 for one rental atnthis place Jimmy knows. Mom says she can help us pick out a dress fornyou since she assumes we will be shopping together.\" Lucyncontinued as she crashed onto her bed to rest. \"I wish Indid not have to bother your mom every time.\" Linda was reallynembarrassed that Mrs. Lane was always being drafted into caring fornher. \"Hey, don't let mom hear you talking that way. Younare the daughter she never had and the sister I wish I had. In othernwords, you are family. An honorary Lane.\" ********** ThenChristmas Ball would be the perfect time for Ethan to set his plansninto action. But he was not going to talk to Clark until he was surenthat he could pull it off by then. First he needed to find thenperfect accessory for Linda to wear. He knew exactly what he wantednto get for her but somehow the jewelry shops at the mall could notnprovide his vision. As luck would have it, his job took himninto the Midvale Park for some tree pruning for the cold months.nWorking near the Midvale pond, a glimmering stone caught his eye. Itnwas an odd but nice shape for a silver gemstone that was stuck withinnthe bark of a tree he was cutting down. He had a hell of time tryingnto pry it out of the tree bark, none of his cutting equipment seemednto be able to free the stone. Everything was worth the effort whennfinally pried out and the saw the whole stone out in thenlight. \"Perfect.\" he smiled as he held it up againstnthe light. It shimmered so brightly that it made his eyes hurt. Henslipped it into his tool-bag pocket for safekeeping. He pullednhis truck up at the the mall on the way home. Back at StylusnJeweler's he asked to see the best ring settings they had for specialnoccasions. Finding one setting he liked in particular, he producednthe stone from his pocket and laid it on the glass counter. \"Cannyou turn this into that in 2 weeks?\" henasked. ********** \"Every time you ask me to meetnyou without letting Kara know I get nervous.\" Kal-El told Ethan.nThey were having lunch at Popeye's on Ethan's invitation. \"Whynso?\" he asked between bites. \"The last time we metnlike this you asked for permission to take care of Kara for me. Younmoved her into the house, became her room mate and her boyfriend atnthe same time. I think I know what comes next.\" \"Sonthen you know what I am thinking?\" \"I think so. Inalways thought Lois and I would do it first but I don't mind Karanending up with you if that is what you both want. You've been throughna lot together.\" he replied before taking a sip of his soda. \"Inhaven't done a shabby job have I?\" Ethan asked. \"You'vendone a great job.I don't think she would have gotten over her griefnwithout you there. She seems to take strength from knowing you arenthere for her. I just wish that Kara was not so pigeon holed intonthis relationship. I mean, she still has her life ahead of her. Shencan still go to college and experience more of life. As far as I amnconcerned, it is too soon. But then the final decision isnKara's\" \"So you would rather I don't propose to yourncousin?\" he had hoped the conversation would not turn out thisnway. \"No. Go ahead and propose. It is her decision. Just,nlet me talk to her before you do it okay?\" If Kara was going tongo and get engaged, Kal-El was going to make sure that she knew whatnshe was getting into. \"That's fine with me.\" Ethannassured him. He dunked the fried chicken into the gravy and took anbig bite. \"When do you plan to do this?\" \"Nextnweek at the Christmas Ball.\" ********** \"Kal-El,nopen up. \" Kara knocked on the window to Kal-El's apartment.nSince Kal-El had limited the use of her powers to non flyingnemergencies, the only chance she had to improve her flying abilitynwas when he asked her to come to his apartment. Kal-El dealt with allnemergency situations that required flying because he was afraid thatnthe recklessness he observed during her battle with Selena would hurtnan innocent. He was just being cautious he told her. Eventually, shenwould fly side by side with him in battle again. She floated for anfew minutes before he finally came an opened the window so she couldnglide in. \"I know I am late but Dean has been giving menhell at the restaurant ever since Supergirl dropped him into the poolnat my party. Plus, I have that dance committee volunteer thing thatnLucy signed us for. I don't seem to have much time these days.\" \"Wenalways knew he was a jerk. I am glad to know you have other socialnactivities though. Keep it up kid.\" Kal-El answered motioningnfor her to take a seat on the couch. He turned off the tv set innorder to have absolute quiet. \"So, why do you need menhere?\" \"I picked these up for you today. You mightnwant to read it over and decide on your future.\" he pointed tonthe college information packets on the coffee table. \"Collegenapplications? You mean I am not yet done studying?\" She wonderednhow many years humans actually spent on their educational process. InnArgo City, she would have been considered an Elder apprentice by now.nOne of the most learned people in the city. \"You justnturned 18 Kara. You have at least 4 more years of college to gonbefore you can stop.\" Kal-el explained. \"4 morenyears???\" \"That is how long it takes to becomenspecialized in a field of study on Earth. I studied Journalism for 4nyears. Do you know what you want to be?\" This was the talk thatnhe had promised Ethan he would have with Kara. Obviously, it was notna conversation to convince her to get married. \"I don'tnknow Kal-El. What more can I be?\" she wondered aloud while shenscanned the pamphlets. \"Whatever and whoever you want tonbe Kara. There are no limitations for anybody on this planet. Takenthose home with you. Read it, study it. Ask me, Lois, Lucy, ornanybody if you have any questions.\" \"I am sure Ethannwill help me sort this out.\" \"Let's not let Ethannknow about this just yet. You may want to surprise him.\" Kal-Elnadvised her. ********** The school gym was convertedninto a Winter Wonderland for what turned out to be a Black and Whitenball as all the women paraded in their black gowns and the men showednoff their white suits. Ethan seemed extra nervous that night.nHe fidgeted each time Linda rested her head upon his chest when theynslow danced. He tried to hold her away from his body each time shengot too close to him. She wondered if she had offended him in somenway. He seemed preoccupied and anxious. \"Are you reallynpopping the question tonight ?\" Jimmy wanted to know while theyngot drinks for the girls at the refreshments table. \"Yep.nThere's no better time than tonight.\" Ethan repliednnervously. \"So why do you look like you are about to takena test that you forgot to study for?\" \"I am justnafraid she might say no.\" \"She has never said no tonyou Ethan. She said yes to moving in with you, without the perks, shensaid yes to getting a car... Wait a minute, are you just proposingnfor the perks?\" \"You have got to be kidding menJimmy. You should know by now that it never figures into ournrelationship. I have held out this long for her, I can hold out somenmore.\" \"So what makes you think she might saynno?\" \"I saw some college application forms in thencar. She's got other plans.\" he explained in a worriedntone. \"Well, Lucy is going off to college too. So it isnonly logical that Linda would probably do the same.\" \"Indon't want to lose her man.\" \"You don't know thatnfor sure.\" Jimmy handed him the punch cup he had ladled out fornLinda. ********** They joined Lucy and Jimmy for anmidnight beach walk after the ball. Linda recognized the beach as thenone where she flew Ethan to the first time she was on Earth. He gotnknocked out in the bump car that he had sought safety in after Selenanused him as bait for Supergirl in the carnival. She landed them onnthis very beach because it looked so safe and serene to her. It wasnthe same feeling she was having at the moment. The night was justnperfect. As they walked hand in hand along the shoreline, theynstarted talking about their future. What they saw their lives like inn5 years and all those things that young people in love dream about.nHe told her that his plans all depended upon her own. That he feltnthat their lives were permanently intertwined now and they would bentogether for life. \"Kara, I need to know you will alwaysnbe in my life. No more flying off and leaving me a broken man.\"nhe told her as the waves lapped at their toes. Their clothes werenalready wet from sitting in the path of the waves. She got andifferent kind of warmth from hearing him call her by her birth name.nIt reminded her of she really was and that in their relationship,nnames did not matter. \"I'll always be with you Ethan. I am notnleaving you anymore.\" she assured him. \"Are younsure?\" \"Positive. I love you too much to leave younever again.\" she answered. She lay her head on his shoulder andnyawned. There was silence between then for a while. Each onenof them seemed to be lost in their ownnthoughts. \"Kara?\" \"Humm?\" ********** Lucynand Jimmy were walking towards them with a torch lamp in hand. Theynsaw Ethan stand up and then get down on one knee. \"Oh mynGod! Jimmy! Is he! Will he?\" Lucy could not find a way to finishnher sentences in her excitement. 'Yep. He's been planning itnfor weeks.\" ********** \"What are you doingnEthan?\" Kara had seen scenes like this in the movies and onntelevision shows before but she never imagined being involved in onenherself. \"Kara, I know that we've been so happy togethernthat it scares me. I have proven myself to you. I have kept my wordneach time I made a promise to you. You always tell me how happy Inmake you. I have never been happier and so content in my life asnwell. We make a good team. Somehow I know that we are meant to bentogether for the rest of our lives. After everything we have beennthrough, we deserve nothing less. The thought that I might losenyou... So I was thinking, why don't we make it official? Let's bentogether forever, bound by the laws of God and man.\" he got downnon one knee and immediately sunk into the wet sand. He had to stop tonbalance himself on the slippery surface. He was going to get thisnright even if it drowned him. \"Are you under a spellnagain?\" she joked nervously referring to the time when he keptnproposing marriage to her while he was under the love spell thatnSelena had cast. He told her then that a simple gardener could make anrich girl very happy. If he only knew how happy he made her by justnbeing with her. Now, he was proposing again. Was it something she hadnto take seriously? \"I'm not kidding Kara. I'd marry younunder Kryptonian Law except I don't know anybody who can do thenceremony. Kal-El hasn't the faintest idea of what to do for such anceremony. That's how serious I am about this.\" Henreached into his breast pocket and produced a small velvety soft box.nOpening it before her he asked \"Kara Zor-El, will you marrynme?\" Kara looked at the ring and then at Ethan. Thenexpression on her face betrayed what was going on in her mind. Whatnjust happened? Was he really proposing to her? Was this what shenwanted in her life? Or did she want more? What was the rightnanswer? Somewhere along the shoreline Lucy's screams ofnexcitement could be heard.[Chapter 11] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain thenproperty of DC Comics, Inc.

Indecision Karanknew all about the duties that would be expected of her if shenaccepted his proposal. something inside her wanted to say yesnimmediately but the voice of Kal-El broke through her thoughts . \"Youncan be whatever and whoever you want to be Kara.\" So nownthe question before her was \"Is this what she wanted to be?\"nWas she willing to dive headlong into marriage at this point in hernlife? Had she possibly experienced everything that a human couldnexperience in so short a time? Was she ready to be all human andnsurrender that which made her special? No more Supergirl? No morenusing her powers? In her mind, that is what it meant to be human. No,nthis was not a decision she could make sitting on wet sand. Thenexpression on her face showed her indecision. \"Linda, I'mnasking you to marry me.\" Ethan explained. He chose to call hernby her earth name in order to signify that he did not care who shenwas and what her name was. \"I know Ethan. I know.\"nshe looked away from him, not really knowing what to say. \"It'snjust a yes or no question Linda.\" he closed the box and put itnback into his breast pocket. \"Nothing is ever that simplenfor me. You should know that.\" she stood up and shook off thensand from her wet skirt. Something told her to walk away fromnhim. \"What's the problem? You said you were never goingnto leave me right? So, let's do it. What's stopping you?\" henwalked after her. \"Kara! Will you wait a minute and talknto me?\" Ethan grabbed her by the wrist and forced her to facenhim. \"It's not you Ethan. It's me. I don't know if Incan...\" \"What is there to know? Nothing changesnafter we get married.\" He reasoned. \"Listen, I knownthat we are practically married. I mean, we live in the same house onnweek-ends and do everything together except for engaging in physicalnintimacy. This is a big deal for me. You are asking me to give up whonI am.\" she tried to contain all her emotions while shenspoke. \"Give up who you are? What the hell are yountalking about? How can I change who you are? That is impossible!\"nHe had never spoken so roughly to Kara ever since they met but theirndiscussion was starting to really irritate him for some reason. Hennever asked her to change anything about her. He loved her exactlynthe way she was. What would make her think such things? \"Ethan,nplease try to understand. I have only been human for months comparednto your lifetime. I have a lot of things to reconcile between my pastnlife and this new one. You can't expect me to changenovernight.\" \"You're not making any sense Linda!\"nhe pulled harder on her to make her stop walking away. But she wasnusing her strength against him now and nothing he did to keep hernwhere he could talk to her was working. \"Somehow I feelnlike you are asking me to choose between becoming human and remainingna Kryptonian You can't make me choose!\" she finallynsaid. \"Nobody is asking you to choose between anything!nWho filled your head with all these ideas?\" he sounded reallynexasperated as he rubbed his face in frustration. \"That'snanother thing. I think I want to go to college before I do anythingnthis serious. I've been considering it.\" \"Linda, youncan do all of those things. You don't have to give up anything fornme. I have never and would never ask that of you.\" Thenwaves thrashing upon the beach seemed to mimic the tempers that werenabout to flare up between the two of them. \"Kal-El toldnme I can be anything I want to be. Be whoever I want to be. But I amnnot sure being your wife is who I want to be.\" \"Ifnyou are trying to hurt me Linda, you are doing a pretty goodndemolition job!\" he shouted at her for the first time in theirnrelationship. \"Ethan, you know I would never hurtnyou!\" \"Really? So what do you call this?\" \"Ethan,njust because I said yes to everything you decided for us before doesnnot mean that I would never say no. \" she tried to explain. \"Sonyou are saying you won't marry me?\" He was shaking inndisappointment. Or was it anger? Why was she choosing to hurt himnthis way? \"No, I am not saying that... Don't confusenme!\" \"Linda!\" \"Ethan! Until I sortnout who I really am, if I am willing to be just Linda and give upnbeing Kara, I cannot answer your question! Right now, right thisnminute, I am Kara!\" she broke out of his grip and ran away fromnhim, changing into Supergirl in the process and taking flight. Jimmynand Lucy came over to him when they saw him lose strength and fall tonhis knees. He looked up at them and said \"Kara or Linda, itndoesn't matter to me. She will always be the girl I love.\" \"Let'snget you home pal.\" Jimmy helped him up. ********** Kal-Elnwas also in the sky at the same time. He was flying home afternstopping a bank robbery at the Metropolis National Bank when he sawnthe familiar figure of Kara zooming through the air headed for hisnapartment. He sped up to catch up with her. \"Kara!\"nHe called out to her. She pulled back in mid-flight and hungnin the air as she waited for him. Taking a moment to wipe her tearsnaway with her sleeves, she knew that he would lecture her for takingnflight with her mind pre-occupied if he saw the tears. But he didn't.nHe seemed to be expecting her. He signaled for her to fly beside himntowards his home. \"I take it Ethan proposed?\" henasked her as he helped her step into the room from the windownsill. \"You knew Kal-El?\" the surprise in her voicenwas evident. \"Do you really think he could have withoutnmy permission?\" he asked her as he disappeared into his room tonchange into his pajamas. \"I wish you had told me.\"nshe complained when he came back with an oversized shirt for her tonchange into. Her gown had soaked her flying clothes through thensecret pouch within her skirt where she kept her alter ego clothesnduring necessary times. \"Tell you what? Kara, I cannotnmake decisions for you. Nor should I influence them. I can merelynadvise you.\" he explained as she disappeared into the bathroomnto change. He went into the kitchen to make them some hotndrinks. \"But that is what I came here for tonight Kal-El.nWhat should I do?\" she pleaded with him for help. \"Whatnshould you do? You are the only one who can answer that question. Itnis your life Kara. You will have to live it. The choice is yours.\"nhe handed her a cup of hot cocoa. \"My choice? My choicesnare, to be human or to be Kryptonian. That was not what I was told bynmy parents when they sent me here.\" \"You don't havento choose to be one or the other Kara. You can be both. That was thenchoice I made.\" \"But, I was entrusted with thensecrets of our race when I was sent here. My duty was clear. To keepnthe traditions of Krypton alive within my heart and being.\" shenexplained to him as she opened the cookie jar and took one out. \"Andnyou have done that Kara. You will continue to do that. Believe me,nyou will.\" \"So why don't I feel like Incan?\" \"Indecision is a human trait. You are becomingnmore human than Kryptonian I guess.\" \"But what if Indon't want to stop being Kryptonian? What if I don't want to be Mrs.nEthan Logan Morrison? What if I want to go to college?\" \"Remembernwhat I told you?\" \"I can be anything I want tonbe?\" \"Exactly.\" \"You are notnhelping! I don't know who or what I want to be!\" \"Therenis only one thing you can do to help you decide.\" he began tonsuggest. It was a risk that he hoped his cousin would be willing tontake. \"I am open to all suggestions.\" she soundednfrustrated. \"Leave Ethan.\" \"What?\" \"Leavenhim. Move out. Stay with me or the Lane's. You have to get away fromnhim in order to clear your thoughts and think properly. Staying withnhim impairs your judgment because of your feelings for him. You neednneutral territory.\" he told her matter of factly. \"Indon't know if I can. That would be like asking me to cut out a partnof my heart.\" she felt a lump in her throat at the thought ofnnot being able to go home to the house and see Ethan smiling at thenbackyard door greeting her when she landed on Friday nights. This wasnher home they were talking about. Her heart's home. \"Yournchoice. Nobody can force you to do anything. Will you be sleeping onnthe couch?\" he asked her. ********** Lucy andnJimmy did not leave Ethan's side. Niether of them contradicted himnwhen he asked them to stop at the convenience store to pick up somenbeer. Jimmy told Lucy that this was one time his friend deserved anfew rounds. He was venting his frustrations at them. Accusing Kara ofnbetraying their love, using him, and a host of other unfoundednaccusations. \"He's too drunk Jimmy. We need to get Lindanback here to take care of him.\" Lucy whispered to Jimmy whennEthan went back to the kitchen for another six pack. \"Gotnany bright ideas about where she flew off to?\" \"Justnone. Try to make him stop drinking okay? I'll be right back.\"nshe scurried up to Linda's room to use the extension phone. \"Clark,nis Linda there? Tell her she needs to come home. Ethan needs her. No,ndon't let her sleep over. She needs to come back here and fix this!\"nLucy put the phone down before Clark could utter anothernword. ********** Jimmy had helped Ethan get changed andninto bed by the time Linda made it back home. Lucy brought her up tondate with Ethan's situation before bringing her to his room. \"Ethan,nLinda's home.\" Jimmy whispered to his half asleep friend. \"Who?nOh her.\" he said as she stood over his bed. Concern filled hernheart as she realized how broken he had become in just a few hours.nShe wondered if he was devastated the same way the first time shenleft him. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked hernturning his head away from her. \"Ethan...\" \"Inthought you did not want to be with me?\" \"I nevernsaid that Ethan. What's wrong with you?\" she signaled to Jimmynand Lucy that she would take it from there. They slowly backed out ofnthe room and closed the door. \"What's wrong with me? Younbroke my heart Linda. I never thought you could hurt me this way. Notnafter everything we went through. Not after everything I did for you.nI thought we meant more to each other.\" he turned over in bed sonthat his whole body faced away from her. \"I told you, Injust need time to sort myself out.\" she tried to explain as shensat on a corner of the bed. \"Do whatever you want. Indon't care.\" \"What happened to \"no pressure\"nEthan?\" she asked him. \"I thought you werenready.\" \"You were obviously wrong.\" Henwas silent once again. The same way he was when they argued aboutnDean. She was now reliving one of the worst fights they had in hernmind. Only this time, she knew they were not going to make up. Shenknew that Kal-El was right. \"Ethan, give me the ring.\"nshe requested him. \"What?\" he sat upright in bed. Ansmile slowly brightening his face. \"Give me the ring.\"nshe repeated. He stumbled out of bed and fumbled with his coatnpocket. Producing the ring he sat next to her and took her hand. Henlooked at her long, slender, and graceful fingers before slipping thenring onto it. He did not see the sadness registering on her face asnhe went through the motion. She held her hand out in front ofnher and stared at the ring. A cold feeling suddenly swept over her. Ansense of forboding that she never felt before. \"What'snwrong?\" Ethan asked her as he nudged her out of her hypnotizednstate. \"Nothing. Nothing.\" she stood up and tried tonthink of the best way to tell him what she had to do. For herselfnmore than anything else. \"Ethan, I will wear this ringnbut, I am not saying that I will marry you.\" He lookednlike he was going to burst in anger at her. \"Wait! Wait! Let menexplain!\" \"I am listening.\" he toldnher. \"There is a reason I asked to wear the ring. I willnbe moving out for a few days. I need to think. I will stay with thenLane's. Lucy will tell her parents to expect me when she gets homentonight. I will move out in the morning. I just need a few daysnEthan. Please try to understand me.\" she felt a distinct stabnthrough her heart as the words escaped her lips. She knew a portionnof her would always stay in this very house no matter where she movednand for whatever reason she needed to leave. Ethan sat on thenbed without moving or talking. He just stared at her. Would this benbest for them? What if she met someone? What if Dean took advantagenof his absence? Regardless of his fears, he would have to trust her.nTrust in their love. Only by taking the pressure off her would he benable to prove that they were meant to be together. \"Hownlong will you be gone?\" the sadness in his voice pained Linda tonhear. He was not even going to try to stop her. \"A fewnweeks. I will be back before exams. This is the only place where Incan study in peace.\" she assured him. Could he survivennot seeing her for a few weeks? \"Promise me you will be herenwhen I come home?\" \"Where else would I be Linda? Ournhearts rememeber? This is the only place where...\" \"Ournhearts are at home because our love lives here.\" she rushedntowards him, kneeling in front of him, willing him to kiss her fornwhat might be the last time. It was a kiss so pure that she almostnchanged her mind about taking time to think about his proposal. Hisnkisses always had a way of clouding her mind and judgment. \"Comenback to me Linda.\" He whispered in heartbreak as she disappearednbehind the closing door.[Chapter 12] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain thenproperty of DC Comics, Inc.

At The Crossroad Ethannwas still asleep when Linda slipped out of the house to move to thenLane's. She felt it was the best way to get away from him. She knewnthat her resolve to follow Clark's advice would be melted the minutenhe looked at her with his doe like eyes. She was hurting more than ifnhe had been the one to hurt her physically and emotionally. Beingntorn between who she was, who she now was, and who she could be leftnher afraid. Afraid that she would make the wrong choices in her lifenon a planet that was not her own, in a life that she had yet to fullynunderstand. Why did he have to go and propose to her? Their life wasnfantastic before he did that. Now, she was lost again and worse, shenhad lost the only person who was her beacon during her dark nights.nWould she ever be able to correct this? What was the answer toneverything that was boggling her mind? Taking only thenschoolbooks that she needed to complete the week-end homework, shenflew to Lucy's place without even peeking into Ethan's room. They hadnmade plans for her to land in the backyard before her parents woke upnso that they would not see her in her alter ego identity. \"Younflew in just in time. They will be up in an hour.\" Lucynwhispered to her as Kara came to a soft landing beside her. Takingnher friend's schoolbooks, she pointed to the cabana and told her tonchange her clothes there before coming into the house. Breakfastnwas a noisy affair at the Lane's. Linda and Lucy sat in the livingnarea while her parents set about making breakfast. \"Rememberingnsomething?\" Lucy nudged her when she noticed Linda staring atnher parents who were setting the dining table not too far from thenliving area. She was remembering something. Ethan would be awake bynnow too. She should be at home helping him make breakfast. He couldnnever get the toaster to work right. The bread slices always came outnas charcoal bricks. \"Girls! Breakast!\" Mrs. Lanenhollered from the kitchen where the smell of freshly brewed coffeenwas permeating the air. Turningnoff the tv, the two young women made their way to the dining room forna breakfast that made Linda remember Ethan even more. Coffee andnscrambled eggs with toast. His favorite. While the family gotninto an active discussion of how Lucy would celebrate her graduationnwith a disco party at the house, Mrs. Lane noticed that Linda wasnstaring into her plate. Her mind was obviously not in the room withnthem. \"Linda dear, you haven't touched your food.\" Shencontinued to stare, not hearing anything. \"Linda...\"nLucy elbowed her friend back to reality. Lucynwas already dreading the school week. If her best friend was going tonbe stuck in a catatonic state in every class, she would have to runninterference at every turn. And with exams coming up... \"Oh,nsorry. The eggs are delicious.\" Linda smiled at her hosts,ntaking a big forkful of eggs into her mouth. The couplenglanced at each other with a pitiful look meant for Linda. Lucy hadnalready told them what had happened the night before. Allowing Lindanto stay with them was their way of helping her. They knew she did notnhave any real parental figure. Clark did not know anything aboutnraising a girl. Otherwise he would not have agreed to let her becomenroom mates with her boyfriend. They still had their doubts about thatnset up but kept it to themselves. Now Linda needed parents and theynhoped that by having her stay with them, they would be able to helpnher sort things out. ********** Lucy invited her tontake a swim before they buckled down to their schoolwork. Linda wasnapprehensive at first because she had never swam before and she didnnot have a suit. \"You can wear Lois' suit, you are almostnthe same size. Don't worry about swimming, it is just like flyingnonly you move your legs up and down like scissors and you move yournarms in a circular motion. It's a piece of cake for somebody likenyou.\" She was right, Linda did super laps in pool withoutnrealizing it until she heard the water start to splash out of thenpool. \"Sorry!\" she told Lucy who was sitting on thenledge of the pool now and shaking water out of hernears. ********** Mrs. Lane had ordered her to take annafternoon nap in order to recover from lack of sleep from the nightnbefore. She did not know that Linda never got tired. So when shenpeeked into the room of Lois that Linda had comandeered for thenduration of her visits, Linda was just lying on the bed with her eyesnwide open. She had a look of confusion and despair on her face, shenhad never seen such a lovelorn face on a young woman before. \"Linda,nare you awake?\" she pretended to ask. \"Oh, come innMrs. Lane.\" Linda replied as she pulled herself upright on thenbed. \"I was wondering if there is anything younneed?\" \"Well, if you don't mind, I need advice.\"nLinda told her. \"About Ethan?\" \"Him andnwhat I should do with my life.\" Linda added. Mrs. Lanentook her place by the window seat, signifying that she was there tonlisten if Linda wanted to talk. \"I am just so confused!nClark thinks I should go to college and Ethan wants us to getnmarried, and I have no idea what I want out of this life that I nownhave. There is so much pressure, I have a family tradition toncontinue and I don't know how Ethan can figure into Clarknis right, maybe I should just break up with Ethan and go off toncollege.\" she sounded very desperate. \"I can see whynClark would advise you to get away from Ethan and go off to college.nBut the only thing that matters right now is you, what you want andnhow you want to do it.\" Mrs. Lane answered. \"That isnjust it. Why do I have to choose? Why can't I be everything all atnonce?\" \"You can be if that is what you want to do.nIt will be hard but if you put your mind to it, I don't see why younshould fail.\" Mrs. Lane encouraged her. \"I can gonoff to college, become a journalist like Clark, carry on a familyntradition and still be happy in love?\" Linda asked inndisbelief. \"Of course. You don't have to go out of statenfor college, you are 18 now. If you want to get married, nobody cannstop you. You can study right here in Midvale if you don't want Ethannto leave his job. You can be in love, married, with a family, andnhave an education. You can have it all if that is what you choose tonhave.\" \"But how do I do it?\" \"Thatnis something only you can answer.\" Mrs. Lane advised while shengot up from the seat and began to straighten out the study table thatnheld Linda's unfinished homework. \"Mrs Lane, how did younknow that it was time for you to get married? How did you know Mr.nLane was the one for you?\" she asked hoping that it would answernall the doubts she had in her mind. She turned to face Lindanthen with a motherly look on her face. She felt sorry for Linda. Shenwas an orphan who needed her parents most at this time. Not thatnClark was not trying to do his part. But there were just some thingsnin life that a young woman needs her mother's advice on. Things likenlove and marriage. Shensat on the bed beside her. \"Mr. Lane was going to join the armynat the time. Lois and Lucy spent most of their lives as army bratsnyou know. Well, the week before he was to go off to the Vietnam war,nhe proposed to me. I thought it was very sweet of I was alsondisturbed by the proposal. We had only been dating 3 months beforenthat and I was still a college junior. \" \"So how didnyou know it was the right decision?\" she queriednhopefully. \"When he went back to the camp and I was alonenin my room. I imagined my life without him and realized I did not seenmy future as clearly if he were not in it. When you can't seenyourself living apart from Ethan, then you know you are ready.\"nshe gave Linda a motherly hug before she left the room. \"Mrs.nLane! Did you finish college?\" Linda called after her as she openednthe door to leave. \"Withnhonors my dear.\" Mrs. Lane winked at her before walking out thendoor. ********** \"Can I see the rock?\" Lucynasked when they got back to their dorm the next day. She refrainednfrom asking to see the ring before they got into their room so as notnto have the girls all giggling and crowding around Linda andndemanding details of the proposal. Her parents had not realized thatnLinda was wearing an engagement ring because it did not look like onenand she had told them that it was a gift from Clark. Lindandropped onto the bed slugishly before holding her hand up for Lucy tonogle. \"What rock is this? It isn't a diamond.\" \"Indon't know Lucy, I did not have the time to ask him.\" shenreplied pulling her hand back. \"Wait!\" Lucy caughtnher hand before she could fully pull away. \"Did you know he hadnyour S emblem carved into it?\" \"What? No. I haventried not to look at the ring.\" Linda thought that the gesturenproved even more that Ethan loved her no matter who she chose to benand accepted who she really was. \"You can see it clearlynif you hold the ring at an angle. Otherwise, it looks just blended innto the gemstone. Can I try it on?\" Lucy asked. \"Sure.\"nLinda offered her hand back so Lucy could take the ring off. Theynwondered if the ring was the wrong size because Lucy could not pullnit off. Not even Linda, with all her super strength could takenit off. She grabbed the ring by the setting and tried to pull it off.n\"Ouch!\" she suddenly let go of her hand. She felt like shenhad been stung by a Kryptonian warrior ant. He finger carried a rashnthat burned deeply into her. \"What happened?\" Lucynwas concerned. The only other time Linda ever registered pain wasnwhen she was shot with Kryptonite. \"I don't know my ownnstrength.\" Linda kidded. The sense of forboding seemed to benstronger now. ********** Ethan was torn betweennvisiting Linda at the dorm and giving her the space she was askingnfor. He was on the school grounds doing his work and he saw Lindanrunning between classes. Usually, she would come over to him firstnand talk before she ran to her class. Checking to make sure he didnnot forget to eat, insist that he change his sweaty shirt, ornanything that let him know how much she cared for him. She was hisnfamily. He never knew caring that way until she came into his life.nBut now she was obviously trying not to glance his way. She knew henwould be standing there like he always did. Is this what shenhad reduced him to? Looking at her from afar and her acting like shenwas being stalked by him? If he had only known that their perfectnlife would have changed this way, he would never even have tried tonpropose. He realized now that it wasn't the marriage that mattered tonhim. It was not physical intimacy, it was her, Kara, she was all thatnmattered in his was her love that kept him going. If he couldnonly take the proposal back... As he heard the lunch bellnsound, he knew that she would have the afternoon off since it was anWednesday. Usually, she flew to the house just to get some quiet timento herself. He would often drop in on her and keep her company untilnit was time for head check at the dorm, then she would fly back. Henwasn't going to last a few weeks this way. He needed her in his life.nHe needed to win her back. He had to tell her to forget the proposal.nHe would tell her it was a stupid move on his part and ask her tonforgive him and take him back. He got into his truck and returned anfew hours later with an armful of pink roses for her. Julie buzzednher room for him. It was Lucy who came down to talk to him. \"Ethan,nyou know she asked for time away from you.\" Lucy reminded himnwhile they talked at the front desk. \"I know, I know. Injust need to tell her something. If I could just have a moment withnher?\" he tried to coax Lucy. \"No way Ethan. Let hernhave her time. It will be best for both of you. Don't worry, I willnlook out for her.\" Lucy assured him. He took a deepnbreath and looked at the flowers. \"Will you make sure she getsnthese?\" \"You got it.\" Lucy took the flowersnfrom him and headed back to the room. ********** \"Ethannbrought these for you. I told him you were not ready to see him yet.\"nLucy placed the flowers on the dresser table where Linda was gettingnherself ready to go to the cafeteria for dinner. Linda did notnsee the flowers that Ethan had handed to Lucy. What sat on the tablenwere a bunch of black roses. Death roses. Why would Ethan give herndeath roses? How dare he! She picked up what she saw to be wiltednflowers and threw it into the trash. \"What did you donthat for!\" Lucy shouted at her. She bent to pick up the flowers.n\"You are wasting perfectly good flowers!\" \"Flowersnof death? Black flowers? What does he think he is trying to say?\"nLinda was visibly angry at Ethan. Lucy looked at the flowersnagain and wondered what was going on with Linda. \"If you don'tnwant it then fine. I will put these in some water.\" \"Thrownit away!\" Linda demanded. She stormed out of the room and didnnot talk to Lucy for the rest of the night. ********** \"Indon't know what came over her last night.\" Lucy was explainingnto Ethan about Linda's reaction to his flowers. She went on tonexplain that Linda had been acting like a brat all day and hernpatience was really wearing thin. They were seated in the receivingnarea of the dorm without knowing that Linda was watching them throughnthe floor from their 2nd floor room using her x-ray vision. \"Indon't understand her. What did I do to make her so angry at me? Inguess she really is serious about cooling off our relationship.\"nEthan said sadly as he stood up. It was obvious he would not benseeing Linda tonight either. \"Ethan,nLinda doesn't know the first thing about the intricacies of humann only knows and understands what you show her andnwhat I explain to her. Don't judge her too harshly.\" Linda warnednhim, hurt that he would doubt the love her best friend carried fornhim. \"Make sure she at least reads this?\" he handednLucy the envelope. \"You bet.\" she replied as theynexchanged good bye hugs. \"Howncould they do this to me? How long have they been cheating on me?\" Linda'snmind was showing her a picture different from what was actuallynhappening. Her thoughts were filled with anger and jealousy at thenthought of her boyfriend's and best friend's betrayal. Howncould Ethan hold Lucy that way and kiss her with the lips that Lindanfelt belonged only to her. She pretended to busy herself withnhomework when Lucy returned to the room. \"Mail callnLinda.\" she dropped the envelop on top of the book she wasnreading. She opened the envelope. \" DearnLucy, I love you --- Ethan.\" \"OhnLucy! How could you do this to me?\" Linda dropped the card andnjumped out the open window, flying off without a destination. \"Whatndid I do?\" Lucy ran to the window shouting. She picked up thencard and read it. \"MynKaralinda, I miss you. My heart is waiting to come home -- Love,nEthan.\" Lucynwas now definite that something was wrong with her best friend. Itnwas time for her to talk to Clark. She left the room and went to thenpayphone outside the dorm building. They were not allowed to havenprivate lines in the dorm rooms. \"Hello,nClark? Lucy here. We have a problem. It's Linda. I do not think shenis coping with the break up as well as we expected her to. Can youncome over?\"[Chapter 13] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc. Movie copyrights and trademarks are owned by Alexander & Ilya Salkind, Warner Bros.

Silver Kryptonite Clark was standing in Mrs. Murphy's office filling out a overnight pass so that Lucy could leave the dorm with him. It would have been impossible for them to discuss the situation in the open area of the receiving room. They were on their way out when Clark spotted Ethan's car coming up the driveway. The car stopped beside them. \"What happened to Linda?\" He asked. One of his greatest fears was that she would once more be hit by green kryptonite and fall deathly ill as she had once in the past. \"That is what we are trying to figure out.\" Lucy answered. \"What do you mean?\" he asked with growing concern. \"Ethan, you are welcome to join us. I think you will be able to answer the question. Can we go back to your house?\" Clark asked. \"Hop in.\" Ethan replied unlocking the back door of the car. ---------- Clark untied his necktie and hung it on the dining chair. Their group had been thinking for more than 2 hours about what could have caused Linda to fly off the handle the way she had. This was more than just confusion. She was disillusioned with her friends for some reason and it seems, more disgruntled with her life. \"Lucy, are you sure Linda never said anything when she was at your place? This is simply not Krptonian behavior. \" Clark wanted to be sure that they had not missed any warning signs from Linda. \"She talked to my mom about Ethan and college, but my mom just advised her about it. Mom says she looked very troubled when they were talking.\" she hoped the information would be able to help. \"This is all my fault.\" Ethan covered his face with his hands. What had he done to her? Why could he not have just left well enough alone? \"Don't say that buddy. We don't really know what happened. One thing for sure is that Linda is not on drugs. Human vices have no effect on us.\" Clark assured them. \"I should not have proposed. The ring, I should not have given it to her. It probably drove her mad to think about all the decisions she had to make.\" Ethan continued to blame himself. The ring. \"Lucy, didn't you say that all of this happened after Linda touched the ring?\" Clark suddenly had a suspicious feeling. \"Yes. It was really strange. She said she did not know her own strength. But I noticed a rash appear on her hand soon after.\" Lucy recalled as best as she could. It was almost midnight and she really wanted to go to bed. But her friend needed her right now. Sleep would have to wait. \"Ethan, the ring, where did you have it made?\" Clark turned to Ethan who was balancing the chair akwardly off the floor. \"Stylus Jewelers. They made the ring specially for me. I found this gemstone in the forest during a job and --\" \"Do you have the shavings or excess stones?\" a light seemed to switch on in Clark's head. \"Yeah. They gave me parts they cut off. Why?\" \"Get it for me. While you are at it, dress warmly and lend Lucy some sweaters to wear too. You're both going with me to the fortress.\" he had a sense of urgency for some reason. \"The fortress? Why?\" Lucy asked worriedly, completely forgetting that the next day was a school day and she only had an overnight pass. \"I need to be sure first. My analyzing tools are there. I hope my suspicions are wrong.\" He explained worriedly. \"Give me 10 minutes to get everything together.\" Ethan told them. He jumped out of his seat and ran upstairs. --------- \"Father, I need your help.\" Kal-El spoke to awaken the Fortress of Solitude. Bright white and green lights turned on in response to his voice. \"What is it my son?\" the voice of Jor-El boomed across the hall. \"It's Kara. Something seems to be driving her to madness. We need to know what is causing it and how to stop it.\" \"There is only one reason that a Kryptonian can be driven to madness. But it is impossible for that component to be found on this planet. It is something that existed only in Krypton.\" \"Tell me father, what component is that?\" Kal-El asked as he signalled Ethan to hand him the plastic with the stone shavings inside. \"Silver Kryptonite. It causes severe psychosis in our kind by magnifying fears, pain, grief, and sadness. Many exposed Kryptonians were driven to end their own lives because of severe exposure. \" Jor-El explained in a monotone voice. Being careful not to touch the shavings, Kal-El emptied the contents into one of the crystal vials, sealed it and placed it into the reading machine he had created in order to safely study the various types of kryptonite he had come into contact with over the years. Silver Kryptonite was something new to him. It took only minutes for the results to come out. Kara had indeed been exposed to Silver Kryptonite. \"No!\" Ethan screamed in pain. If Kara ended up dead he would never forgive himself. \"Father, please. I know there is a cure. Tell me what it is! the Silver Kryptonite is being worn by Kara on her finger. \" Kal-El pleaded with the voice of his father. \"The only cure would be to have 2 Kryptonian men subdue her to unconsciousness. During this time, you have only 5 minutes within which you must force her to subconsciously face all the fears and pain that she has been keeping inside her. If she defeats her inner demons, the ring shall fall off by itself.\" \"But I am the only other Kryptonian on this planet!\" Kal-El was desperate. How could he save his only remaining relative? She was his last link to a past he never knew. She was the reason he now understood more about what it meant to be Kryptonian more than he ever could by studying the crystals that surrounded him. No, he would not accept that he could not save his cousin. He had saved her once before, he could do it again. Lucy began sobbing upon hearing that the solution was unattainable. Linda was just beginning to live her life. They were sisters. \"Kal-El! We have to try something! Anything!\" Ethan sank onto an ice slab. Feeling defeated and hopeless. He had sentenced the woman he loved to definite death. There was nothing more that could be done. Unless... \"Your father said 2 Kryptonian men right?\" he asked Kal-El as an idea formed within him. \"Yes. and unless you know where a stock of Krptonian beings are collected like mice for experiments, that plan won't work.\" \"What if it were possible for me to gain Kryptonian strength? Would that work?\" he asked, almost sure that the solution was almost on hand. \"Maybe. It is worth a shot. What are you suggesting?\" He looked up at Kal-El. \"We need to go see Nigel.\" --------- \"Are you sure this wizard can help us? He sounds like a quack to me.\" Clark asked as they drove over to Nigel's estate. Nigel had cashed in on Kara's first visit to the planet and struck it rich. He had sold his story to the tabloids and news shows by showcasing his story as a mentor turned prisoner in the hands of Selena. Earning so much from the sales of his books chronicling the rise and demise of his former ward, he had gained enough wealth to quit his teaching job and be free of the \"young hooligans\" as he termed the students of Midvale School for Girls. Now he lived in the a very secured manor located on the outskirts of town. Ethan could only hope that he would talk to them. There was a private road leading to the manor. Getting in was difficult as Nigel had an intercom buzzer at the gate. Those in the media who had visited him there for interviews always complained about the game of questions that was involved before he would unlock the automatic gates to allow others to enter. Ethan pressed the buzzer and hoped for the best. \"Who dares disturb my slumber? Do you wish to turn into a human frog?\" Nigel finally answered on the 6th buzz. \"Nigel, It's Ethan. You know you can't turn me into a frog. Who would tend to your gardens? Let me in. I need your help.\" \"Ah! Ethan! Of course, come in young lad. My lawn has been looking a bit brown lately.\" they heard the strong magnets holding the gates lock release and fall open. ---------- \"You mean, that mousy haired classmate of yours is Supergirl?\" Nigel could not believe the story that Lucy and Ethan were telling him. More unbelievable was that they wanted him to believe that the man standing before him in a coat and tie was actually Superman. \"Believe us Nigel. We would not lie to you. We really need your help. She needs our help.\" Ethan told him. They were seated in his receiving room surrounded by sculptures of gargoyles in various poses that struck so much fear into Lucy that she latched onto Clark and never let go even after they had sat down on the antique looking leather sofa. \"I don't know anything about alien magic. I cannot help you.\" Nigel replied wondering why Ethan thought he could magically turn him into a Kryptonian. He went about straightening his books of spells and magic hoping to get an inspiration that might help them. \"Nigel, please, think. There must be something we can try. You know what we have to do. I believe in your capabilities. In your magic. We can't let her just go mad and die.\" Ethan pleaded, bowing his head in frustration. Scanning the rest of his books, Nigel wondered if Ethan would be strong enough to survive the only solution he could think of. Nobody had successfully used the potion yet. Most of them ended up either driven to madness or dead. \"There is a plant that can probably give you what you want.\" He took out one of the leather bound books called \"Mystical Plants of Witchcraft\" and began to scan the pages. Finding the necessary page, he read it quickly and put the book down on the coffee table. Walking over to the fireplace, he inverted the gargoyle head on the left side. A clicking sound followed and a hidden drawer slid into view below the gargoyle. He chose one bag of seeds and took it out of the holder. \"These are Virtus seeds. I acquired them during a trip to ancient ruins in Africa. Follow these instructions to the letter. With any luck, you will have the strength you need within 48 hours.\" Nigel was busy scribbling instructions for Ethan to follow. \"Fantastic!\" Ethan said hopefully as he took the seeds and instructions from Nigel. \"Strength is one thing. How do you get her to confront her fears?\" Lucy reminded them. \"That is where you come in Lucy. \" Nigel addressed her as he held out another bag of seeds. \"These are bluebell, bleeding heart, and snapdragon leaves. Boil it and collect the smoke in a personal item of Kara while saying this spell: \"Take the pain from within, it cannot remain here anymore.\" \"Ethan, you will have to say a variation of the spell as you slam the item into her forehead. I have it written down for you. Hold it there until she is rendered unconscious. Do not let her go no matter how she struggles and becomes heavy to subdue and carry. That is very important.\" Nigel instructed him. As the group headed out the door, Clark spoke to Nigel. \"It is my hope that these things you gave us will work. It is important that Kara survive this darkness.\" \"I feel guilty about Kara. Had I not encouraged Selena...\" \"It was nobody's fault. This is her destiny. She must survive in order to live the life intended for her.\" Clark told him as they got into the car. ---------- As the car drove away, nobody noticed Kara step out from behind the trees. She was beginning to look haggard having flown all over Midvale without any destination in mind. There were voices in her head. Voices that she tried to drown out by flying as fast as she could. Now she could hear the voices telling her Lucy had betrayed her and turned Kal-El against her. \"Lucy shall pay for stealing Ethan from me. I wonder if Jimmy knows about her unfaithfulness. I must tell him. Why was Kal-El with them? How easily she turned him against me.\" she thought as she flew off without direction yet again. She had heard everything they discussed. She would not let them touch her. She was not insane and she would prove it to them even if she had to fight Kal-El and Ethan to her death.[Chapter 14] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain thenproperty of DC Comics, Inc.

Darkness Descends Thenpain inside her head was excruciating. She had two voices battlingnfor control of her deep first one was telling her tondestroy her friends and end the life of the man she loved for hisnbetrayal. It was this voice that she tried to push out of her mind.nShe tried to remind herself of how much her friends had put up withnin the past in order to protect her. How much Ethan had done to savenher when she had almost died. These were not people who wished to donher harm. \"Get outnof my head!\" she screamed as she spun out of control whilenflying. The voices were getting louder with the passing of time. Sonloud that it had turned into a tormenting pain for her. \"Ethanndoesn't love you. He wants to hurt you. He wants to kill you so hencan go with Lucy. All his past decisions were wrong. He has seen thatnnow. Kill them both! They don't deserve to live!\" an evil sounding version of her own voice was echoing in hernthoughts. \"I won'tndo it! I won't hurt my friends! No!\" she screamed as shenstruggled to regain control of her flying. \"Younhave to! You want to stay alive? Then destroy them!\" \"No!nI would rather die!\" \"Thenndie you shall Kara... die you shall!\" she felt as if her brain was going to explode. Shenheld her temples as she tried to stay conscious. Closing her eyes andnstanding up in mid-flight, she began grasping and pulling on her longnblond locks in an effort to relieve the pressure that threatened tontear her apart. Tryingnto regain control of her senses, Kara pushed herself to remember whennshe first started feeling this way. When did the voices start? Afternshe had grabbed the gemstone on the ring. After the rash that nowncovered and reached up to the middle of her arm appeared. The ringnhad something to do with it. Taking hold of the object on her finger,nshe poured all her effort into taking it off. She spun into aerialncartwheels in an effort to force it off but nothingnhappened. Hurlingnthrough the sky while battling the pain, Kara wished there were somenkryptonite on hand that she could stab herself with in order to endnher suffering. Maybe Kal-El, Ethan, and everyone else would be betternoff without having to constantly worry about her after all. Weakenednby the mental anguish,she could not steer herself out of thenthunderstorm forming above the clouds. Flying directly into the pathnof a thunder strike, she was hit square on the back, knocking hernunconscious body out of the sky. ********** Theynhad slept in shifts, taking turns watering the Virtus seeds every 3nhours while it sat over a flaming charcoal pot. The instructions werenclear, they had to plant the seeds together with the amulet that theynwere going to use to make Kara face her pain. It was difficult tonawaken every 3 hours even though Clark kept the coffee coming andninsisted that he did not need any sleep. Such was the schedule thatnthey would have to keep for the next 24 hours if they were to have anprayer of saving Kara from herself. Thenclock struck 9 AM. Clark excused himself to go back to the school tonformally get the girls excused from school for a few days. He wouldnworry about dealing with the Lane's later. The important thing nownwas to get everything ready for the battle that lay ahead ofnthem. Jimmy was justnabout to knock on the door when Clark opened it. \"Lois asked mento come over with breakfast.\" \"Theynneed that more than I do.\" Clark said showing Jimmy in. \"Couldnyou hang around and lend them a hand till I get back? I have to go tonthe school for a bit.\" he requested Jimmy who was setting thenfood down on a table before the sleeping pair of friends. \"Nonproblem. I called in sick with Perry today.\" \"Thanks.nOh, wake up those two in an hour. Have them show you what to do.\"nClark instructed loudly as he walked towards thendoor. ********** Ethannleft Lucy and Jimmy to tend to the plants. He was going throughnLinda's dresser drawers looking for her small box of memories. Innorder to make the plant flourish at exactly noon, the spell callednfor the crushing of the person's childhood hair into the soil. Afternwhich the plant would grow to full size and blossom in a few moments.nThe effect would help the afflicted remember the past and offer anglimpse into the future. \"Gotnit!\" he said triumphantly when he found the S-emblem bearing boxnat the bottom of her shirt drawer. Now the problem was how to opennit. It would only open up for Kara as far as he could tell. Henremembered that she had to touch the palm of her hand to the outlinenon top of the box before it would open to full size and reveal itsncontents. \"Onenproblem down.\" he announced dropping the box in front of Lucy atnthe dining table. Jimmy was feeding more coal bricks into the stovenwhile Linda showered the soil with more water. There was a green bulbnbeginning to show above the dark potting soil. He glanced at hisnwatch. They had 2 more hours to go. \"Jimmy,npass me that piece of paper.\" Lucy told him indicating theninstruction sheet from Nigel that was being held down by the coffeenpot. Reading the rest ofnthe instructions, Lucy decided that she and Jimmy would have to leavenEthan to keep up the watering of the seed and feeding the flame sonthat they could get the necessary \"freshnwater from a source that has not passed through a water pipe.\" That closest source would be the Midvale Lake. \"Takenthe box with you. If you see Linda, figure out a way to get her tontouch the box and come back here as soon as you can.\" \"Whyndoes it have to be here childhood hair! I really doubt that Lindanwould be willing to touch this for me right now.\" Lucyncomplained. \"Wellnif Clark could do it, we would not need to have Linda would we?\"nEthan was being sarcastic. \"Whatever.\"nLucy snatched the box from him. \"Injust have this gut feeling that Linda is out there watching us.\"nEthan explained. ********** Karanhad fallen face first onto the ground near Midvale Lake. The soundsnshe heard as she came to scared her. She opened her eyes and saw anhuge rat in front of her trying to nibble on the ring. She drewnherself upright and ran. When she looked back again, a gray furrynrabbit was sitting where she had seen the rat. \"Inam going crazy! I need help! \" Kara cried out. Almostnimmediately, the voices were back. Hearing familiar voices by thenedge of the forest, she peeked from within the bushes and saw Lucynscooping up water with Jimmy holding the water jug open. \"Nownis your chance Kara. Tell Jimmy. He needs to know.\" the voice coming from the recesses of her mind prodded. \"No!nYou are wrong!\" she shouted loudy, catching the attention of thenpair. \"That wasnLinda.\" Jimmy said. The voice was even louder now. Who was Lindanarguing with? \"We'vengot to help her.\" Lucy said without a second thought. Droppingnthe dipper, she pulled Jimmy towards where they heart thenvoice. \"Give me thenbox.' she told him. Karanwas locked in a battle with herself. She saw a shadowy image suddenlynattack her as she tried to shake the voices out of her head. Thenentity held her neck in a lock. Strangling her as tightly asnpossible. Kara was trying to fight it off. Rolling all over thenground and slamming into the trees. WhatnJimmy and Lucy saw proved to them that the psychosis was gettingnworse. Linda was strangling herself with her own bear hands. Lucynreached her first and pried Kara's hands off while Jimmy tried tonhold her down. \"Lucy!nHelp! I don't know what's wrong with me!\" she cried out in anmoment of sanity. \"Kara!nStay with us Kara!\" Lucy cried out as she watched her friend'sneyes roll within its sockets. Jimmy continued to hold her down asnbest as he could while her body convulsed. Hernattitude had changed completely by the time the convulsions werenover. Her eyes looked like she had not slept in weeks, clothes werensoaked with sweat even though she did not normally wet her clothesndue to her different metabolism. She opened her eyes and laughedndiabolically at them. \"Donyou really think you can hold me down Jimmy?\" She held his legnnearest to her and shoved him backwards. The impact of his body onnthe tree sent chunks of tree bark flying through the air. He writhednin pain. His spine had hit with such tremendous force that he feltnlike his back had broken in at least 3 places. \"Didnyou know that Lucy was cheating on you Jimmy?\" she told himnwhile he reeled from the impact. \"Kara,nI never did anything of the sort!\" Lucy defended herself whilenshe ran to Jimmy's side to tend to him. \"Ohnno? I saw you with Ethan. You were kissing him! And what about thencard he gave you?\" She came over and picked up Lucy with onenhand by her throat so that she could not answer. Tossing her aside,nshe slammed into a boulder that was sticking out of the ground. Lucynfelt the ligaments in her arm tear. She screamed in burning pain.nLinda was walking towards her. Ready to hurl her once again. Thisnwas her chance. Holding the box upright in front of her, she grabbednLinda's hand before it could touch her and slammed it onto the box.nIt reacted instantaneously. \"Whatndid you do?\" Kara asked in surprise, totally not recognizing hernheritage box. Feeling a sudden rush of fear she turned and kickednupwards to fly away from them. \"Kara,nwhere are you going?\" Lucy wanted nothing more than to stop hernfriend from running. \"Tonfind Kryptonite and be with my parents!\" Kara shouted as shendisappeared with a sonic boom. \"Wenneed to get to the hospital.\" Jimmy was panting his words innweakness. \"First,nwe need to get these things to Clark and Ethan.\" Lucy saidnholding onto her injured arm as she tried to getnup. ********** Clarknflew the injured to the hospital and returned to see Ethan almostnfinished with the preparations for the potion and amulet. Thenseed came to full bloom as he watered it at exactly noon. Thenyellowish brown blossom had the petals of a daisy formed like a rosenblossom. The green gel like center held the pollens that he was tonmix with the washing of the charcoal ashes and drink in order to gainnthe equivalent of super human strength. \"Arenyou sure you want to go through with this? I think you forgot to readnthe fine print\" Clark asked him. Ethanntook the instructions from him and read the bottom of the page. \"Thenpower will last only 2 hours. If you fail to subdue the inner demonnof the possessed at the end of 2 hours, the elixir shall turn into anpoison within you. Releasing your own inner demon to feed upon yournsoul resulting in a slow and painful death.\" Hencould die. Was he willing to die to save Kara? There was no doubt innhis mind as to the answer. Yes. \"Herengoes nothing.\" Ethan said putting the smoking glass to his lips.nIt tasted like cigarette ashes. He almost threw up the first fewngulps of the tonic. He will never be able to explain how he was ablento hold down the full glass. \"Donyou feel anything?\" Clark asked him. \"Nothing.\"nEthan replied sadly. He had failed. \"Maybenit just takes a little time.\" Clark said trying to pacifynhim. \"Kara doesn'tnhave time! I have to save her! She is all I have Clark! She is mynfamily and my life!\" Ethan punched the table top and broke it innhalf. A look of shock crossed his face. \"Ohnyeah, I think you are super now.\" Clark patted him on thenshoulder. \"Now youngo to the backyard and learn how to control that power and make itnfast. Let me work on the amulet.\" \"Inalready worked on that while you took them to the hospital. Let's notnwaste time Clark.\" Ethan pleaded. He produced the necklace henhad given Kara for her birthday from his back pantsnpocket. \"Alright.nAre you ready to take flight?\" Clark was amazed at the bravadonthat Ethan was displaying. Ethannheaded to the backdoor and opened it. \"After younSuperman.\" ********** Nothingncould compare to the feeling Ethan had while he soared through thenskies with Superman. So this was how it felt to take flight. He feltnso free and happy up in the clouds. It was no wonder that Kara lovednto fly every chance she got. Henwondered how strange he looked wearing his everyday clothes next to anSuperman. They were flying high enough not to be seen by thentownsfolk because there would be no way to explain how the townngardener was able to fly like Superman. \"Wherendo we look for her?\" he asked Superman. \"Lucynsaid Kara told her she was going to find green Kryptonite so she cannbe with Zor-El and Alura. There is only one place she might be ablento find that.\" \"Thenfarm. She is going to dig up the earth to look for Kryptonite.\"nEthan replied grimly.[Chapter 15] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

The Strength Of 2 Kryptonian Men As the two men flew over the Midvale sky, Ethan made a request of Kal-El. \"Let me handle Kara. I know I can get through to her without hurting her.\" \"The problem is not our hurting her Ethan. The problem is her hurting herself. I will back off and let you handle her when you think it is time.\" Kal-El assured him. There was no mistaking that Kara was burrowing deep into the farmland as Kal-El and Ethan approached. The soil that the cousins has so carefully laid back into the ground after burying her ship was now billowing upward like a tornado as she sped in circles underground trying to find any sign of Kryptonite that had attached to the ship or perhaps been strewn into the soil when she crashed. Kal-El signaled Ethan to wait for him. He would fly into the hole and force Kara out. Ethan could then grab her and try to help her regain control of her senses. Flying headlong into her, Kara threw a punch that sent him reeling out of the hole. \"She is insanely strong. I don't think she had found the kryptonite yet. I am going back in. \" he warned Ethan. \"Kal-El, please, make the voices stop! It's telling me hurt you!\" she cried out when she saw her cousin coming towards her as she flew out of the crater. She was slipping in and out of sanity at this point and was only being held together by her will power to stay in the realm of reality. \"Fight it! Clear your mind Kara! Let us help you Kara. Don't fight us! We can help you!\" \"I want you to help me. But the voices won't stop!\" she flew away from him and directly into an oak tree. She broke the tree in half when her head hit the trunk. She wanted to injure herself badly to make the voices stop. Where was that Kryptonite? Bang-Or told her it would scatter over Earth after Argo City burst from the destruction of the Omegahedron. It was the only way to end her suffering. Landing on an undug part of land, she fell to her knees and began speed digging into the soft soil. \"Kara stop it!\" Kal-El tried to pull her away from the area. If she found the Kryptonite, all would be lost. She started to feel weakness. \"I found it!\" she exclaimed, slowing down as she neared the toxic stone. Kal-El fell to his knees as the greenish glow began to surface. \"Kara, stop!\" he begged her as he slumped beside her. Ethan recognized the sign of Kryptonite poisoning and immediately flew down to aid them. The elixir he had drank did not actually make him Kryptonian although it mimicked their powers. Exposure to Kryptonite would have no effect on him. \"Drop the crystal Kara!\" he hollered at her as he landed nearby. \"Ethan, please, let me go! I don't deserve to be here. I don't deserve your love. I know you don't love me. I don't want your pity.\" Kara pleaded with him as she raised the crystal above her head. \"Kara, listen to yourself. Nothing you are saying is true. It is the ring that I gave you. Let me help you. Let me take it off.\" \"No! This is the only memory I will have of you after I take Kal-El with me back home to Argo City.\" she started shivering, a sign that she was going to start having seizures soon. \"Kara...We can't go back. There is no going back. Argo City has been destroyed. Earth is our home now.\" Kal-El tried to speak weakly. \"That's not true Kal-El. Together, we can find another portal home. Argo City is not destroyed. Mother and father are waiting for us.\" Kara held the rough blade like side of the crystal to her wrist. These delusions were part of the final stages of Kryptonian psychosis according to Jor-El. There was not much time left. Alarms from Ethan's watch filled the air. It had been an hour since they first landed here. He would be losing his powers at an accelerated rate very soon. \"Kara, don't leave me. Don't you remember? I am your home. My heart is your home. You don't need to go back to Argo City.\" he slowly inched his way closer to her. He would have to lunge for the Kryptonite before she slit her wrists. \"We were never in love Ethan. We don't even know each other was all just an illusion.\" She pressed the edge against her wrist. \"Kara, don't be a fool. Earth can be your home if you choose to accept it.\" Kal-El tried to reason with her. His chest was starting to feel heavy. Breathing was becoming difficult for him. What was Ethan waiting for? \"You don't understand! I don't deserve to live. I allowed my parents to die! I did not even try to stop the explosion! I did not try hard enough to convince them to leave with me!\" the pain of guilt and suffering could not be masked in her voice. \"Just keep talking Kara, I need you to recognize your inner agony.\" Ethan thought to himself. He looked at Kal-El who was trying to crawl away from the Kryptonite. Nodding at Kal-el, his message was clear, he would take over from that point. \"I destroyed my own people! I caused their death! All because I was careless with the Omegahedron! It is not fair that they should die and I shall continue to live.\" He tried to ignore the almost regular beeps from his watch that signaled the impending end of the elixir effectivity. But he needed to let her talk so he could get near her and that took time. Ethan preempted her from dragging the blade across her wrist. Lungin for her, he grabbed her hand with his own and enclosed her in a vise-like grip with his other arm. Flying upward, he slammed her hand against her side until she let go of the Kryptonite. He caught it and hurled it as far away as possible from the farm. Giving Kal-El some time to recover and join him in subduing Kara. \"Let me die Ethan! Let me go home! My parents are waiting for me!\" she kept shouting as she tried to break free from his embrace. \"Linda! Kara! I won't let you die like this! We've come too far. You have to live, live for me because I would be better off dead without you! I am nothing without you!\" He kissed her on the cheeks as his alarm went off again. He had 10 minutes left with which he could either save her life or meet his death. \"I should have died with them. I have to pay for my sins Ethan. Please! The voices are right. Nothing good will ever come of my life because I have killed by my own hands. My death is the only atonement.\" she began to cry. She was willing him to let her go. This was the only way she would be able to see the parents she ruefully missed. She was beginning to drift in and out of consciousness as they hovered in the skies that were now turning red as the sun began to set. \"It wasn't your fault Kara. You could not have stopped those things from happening. \" he tried to hold her steady as he reached into his back pocket for the necklace. She continued to struggle as he tried to press the gemstone pendant hard against her temple. He was breathing hard and feeling his power beginning to drain as he recited the spell that would cast her inner demons out. \" Behold this woman suffering from unspeakable pain. Her days and nights are filled with nightmares of days and lives past. Take all that troubles her. Banish her pain and guilt. These have no place within her now mended heart. In its stead, show her the future bright. \" A blinding glow began to seep through the sides of the pendant. He felt her stiffen in his arms. Her face registered immense anguish. Eyes shut tightly, a soundless scream emanated from her lips. Her breathing seemed to have been cut off. Within the subconscious mind of Kara, she began to see everything clearly now. Everything happened for a reason. This was her destiny. One that her parents had no bitterness about. They helped her survive in order to help Kal-El. Kal-El needed family just as much as she did. She saw them flying side by side across the Midvale sky as they worked to protect those who needed it most. But there was something else. A vision of the future. A future that was filled with love, hope, and a happy home. As a smile appeared on her face, 2 things happened. The light from the pendant began to subside and the Silver Kryptonite ring slipped off her finger. Falling into the crater that she had created earlier. Ethan slumped over her shoulder as his powers drained away. He felt a searing heat emanating from within him. The elixir was now turning into poison. He blacked out but still kept a tight grip on her. The two unconscious bodies were now free-falling in the sky. Kal-El, barely recovered from the effects of Kryptonite flew as fast as he could towards them. \"Kara! You must wake up! Kara! Kara-El!\" Kal-El shouted into her ear. She awoke with a start. \"Oh my god! Ethan! Wake up Ethan ! Kal-El, what happened?\" Kara was just realizing that she was wrapped securely in Ethan's arms. How did he get her up there? She did not recall flying them up. What was Kal-El doing there? Breaking free of his grip, she manouvered his body so that he ended up lying on her back as they flew to safety. Kal-El knew that Ethan was going to die if he did not move fast. Ordering Kara to drop Ethan's body, he flew down alongside it. Freezing the body with his super-breath in the process. Maybe, just maybe it would stop the spread of the toxins within his system until they could figure out how to render the elixir harmless within his system.[Chapter 16] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

It can't be!\" Kara cried upon learning of what had happened. She could not remember anything beyond showing Lucy the ring in the dorm room. Ethan's body lay in the fortress of solitude, unmoving and seemingly lifeless. \"Kal-El, help me! You told me before, you turned back time for Lois, you saved her life! Tell me how to do it.\" she beseeched him. \"Neither of you must interfere with the human ways. Death must never be prevented.\" Jor-El's voice warned them. \"Father, she loves him.\" Kal-El pleaded for permission to tell her the secret to turning back time. \"No Kal-El. Do not disobey me. You already altered the future when you saved Lois. It must never happen again.\" Kara was visibly devasted. She had injured her friends so badly that they were confined in the hospital and now this. Ethan could not be dead! She refused to accept that he had given his own life for her. This was not what she saw in her vision! \"He does not look dead Kal-El. I cold swear he was just sleeping.\" she told him when he came over and put a hand on her shoulder. She had his body cradled in her lap while she touched his hair. \"Maybe he isn't dead Kara. I did something when I told you to drop his body. I put him in the Kryptonian equivalent of a cryogenic freeze.\" Kal-El told her. She looked up hopefully at him. \"You mean he is just sleeping?\" \"Maybe. I can't be sure what the status of the elixir was when I froze him.\" \"How do we find out?\" \"Heat vision. Thaw him out Kara. But be careful. The heat should be strong enough to render the poison in his system non toxic after being frozen for so long. But, you should not use so much heat that you burn his internal organs as well. Too much heat and he dies. Too little heat and he dies. It is a tricky procedure.\" he explained to her. Kal-El lay Ethan out on an ice slab and positioned Kara at his feet. \"This will work Kara.\" He encouraged her. \"It will work.\" She suddenly sounded and felt hopeful. She remembered what she had seen in her mind earlier. \"Why do you know?\" \"Because Kal-El, I've seen my future.\" she replied as she unleashed her heat vision on Ethan. Starting at his head going down to his toes. ********** There was still no movement from Ethan even after he had been thawed out. She sat beside him, holding his hand and willing him to awaken. She could hear his heart beating. The procedure had worked afterall. But he seemed to be in a comatose state. All she needed was for his big brown eyes to open up and smile at her. She held his hands tightly in hers. Kal-El had gone into his healing chamber in order to get over the effects of the Kryptonite exposure and left her to tend to her unconscious boyfriend. He saw her lay her head down over her arms. She too was exhausted from what had happened to her and needed to rest. But she did not want to leave Ethan's side. She wanted to be right there when he woke up. Hours had passed and the lovers remained asleep. Kal-El had flown out to get food in case Ethan woke up. He was sure to be famished. So there was nobody to notice when his eyelids began to flutter. He felt cold instead of heat. Was he in heaven? Glancing around, he recognized the fortress. He couldn't move his hands. Looking down he saw Kara pinning his hands underneath her head. \"Kara?\" He whispered weakly as he tried to move his hands from under her. Was she dreaming? She thought she heard Ethan's voice. \"Kara, wake up.\" There is was again. Slowly opening her eyes, she lifted her head and saw his brown eyes smiling lovingly at her. \"Ethan!\" she yelled. Her fingers impulsively touched and traced his lips with an urgent need. \"Ethan! I love you! I don't know what happened! I don't know what to say to make up for you risking your own life for me\" she began stammering. \"It was all my fault Kara. The ring, it was Silver Kryptonite...\" he explained as he slowly got up from the ice slab. \"I know. Kal-El explained it all to me.\" she replied while pulling him in for a passionate embrace. \"Ethan! You are awake! It worked afterall! .\" Kal-El had just flown back in with an armload of burgers for them. Jor-el's voice interrupted their merry making. \" You have both defied fate for your personal reasons. It should never be done. Both of you do not understand what the repercussions of your actions are. You have unleashed the unknown upon yourselves.\" he warned. \"Oh father, for once in your after life can't you just be happy for everyone here?\" Kal-El asked jokingly. \" Happiness is a fleeting experience my son. You have both chosen to become human to an extent. All your actions will have sad repercussions in the future. There is a now a danger to both of you that Zor-El, Allura, your mother, and I never foresaw nor took into consideration when we all decided that the Earth would be the best place to send the last two of the Kryptonians.\" Jor-El seemed to be relaying a cryptic message to Kara and Ka-El that fell upon deaf ears. ********** They visited Lucy and Jimmy in the hospital a few days later. Linda was hesitant to visit after being told of everything she had put them through during her psychosis. She could not even work up the nerve to speak to the Lane's who had been so kind to her in the past. \"Ethan, tell her to come in. She can't hide from us forever.\" Lucy told Ethan when he had told her that Linda was waiting outside the door. Afraid of what her best friend might say or do to her. \"She won't come in Lucy. You know her.\" \"I know she can hear me. If she doesn't come in here, I am taking this cast and IV trolley and going out to her.\" Lucy threatened. The door broke open and the familiar face of her best friend showed up. Unable to look directly at the people in the room. \"I can't Lucy. Not after I banged you and Jimmy up real bad.\" \"That wasn't you Linda. We understand what happened. Don't we Jimmy?\" Lucy asked Jimmy who was in the next bed. They had a semi-private room. \"But the injuries...\" \"Will heal. And our friendship will never change. This just made our gang stronger.\" Jimmy finished Linda's sentence for her. \"Now get in here girl!\" Lucy demanded with a soft giggle.[Chapter 17] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

All the girls were busy getting ready and packing up their things in the dorms. Everyone was bursting with excitement and looking forward to attending college in the Fall. Everyone that is, except Linda. As Kara, she spent her recovery time at the Fortress of Solitude under Kal-El's watchful eye. When she gained enough strength back, she, as Linda, went and stayed with Clark at his apartment for the rest of her senior term. Not once during all that time did she ever go back to the home she once shared with Ethan. Taking Clark's advice to heart, she fought the urge to go to Ethan even when she saw him on campus. Something that tore her apart because she had reassured him of her love at the fortress before. Somehow, Ethan seemed to understand her need to stay away even without her saying a word. They were on amicable terms, greeting each other when they crossed paths, even waving at each other when they were too far apart to say hello. The length of time that it took for graduation day to arrive seemed so long to Linda. What if, during all the time that he had honored the space she asked for, he had fallen out of love with her? Could she handle that? What if her future did not lie with him afterall? What if her vision was only what she wanted to see, but was not the reality of her future? \"Just enjoy the day will you Linda? Don't rain on our parade. We have all worked really hard to get here.\" Lucy encouraged her as they checked each other's turqoise toga outfits. \"But what if he did fall out of love?\" Linda asked worriedly as she brushed off her friends shoulder. \"Then you will grieve a little but life will go on. Ethan will not be the end of your world Linda\" Lucy reassured her. \"All seniors report to the main quadrangle. The graduation march will start in 15 minutes.\" Came the voice of Principal Danvers over the sound system. \"Grab our caps and let's get outta here!\" Lucy instructed Linda. Ethan watched from a distance as he continued to prune the bushes near the quadrangle. How he wished that he could be a part of Linda's big day. He was staying away for a reason and he could only hope that she understood how much it hurt him to pretend to be a mere friend to her. How hurt he was that he could not be there with Clark and the Lane's in the audience to watch her receive her diploma. As if she sensed that Ethan was nearby, Linda suddenly turned and looked in his direction. He knew that she could see him clearly and that she would hear him if he spoke. \"Congratulations Linda. You have come very far. I am sure your parents are very proud of the woman you have become.I know that I am very proud of the woman whom I love with all of my being.\" he whispered in no particular direction. The smile that she threw his way was enough to make him feel like he had actually participated in her graduation festivities. He had no idea about the life altering surprise Linda had in store for him. This was Linda's first visit to the Daily Planet office. Jimmy wasn't around and somehow she ended up conversing with the Editor in Chief while waiting for Clark to come back to his desk. \"Clark, some kid looking for you. Calls herself Linda. Says she is is your cousin.\" Perry White ducked into the copy room where he was running drafts of his report. \"Yes she is. Thanks Perry. I'll be there in a bit.\" Clark replied. \"Never thought he had family. Never spoke about parents or anything. This Kent is really a strange one. Cousin my foot. Looks more like his daughter to me.\"\" Perry was mumbling under his breath. Clark chuckled at what he heard through his super hearing. Maybe he did look like Linda's father. After all he had been through to save her and protect her, from death, Selena, and now psychosis, he did have a sort of fatherly feeling for her. \"If you are sure that is what you want to do and be, you have my full support\" he told her as she explained her detailed plans for her future life. Clark could tell that she had given the matter a lot of thought and somehow, he believed that she had found a way to glimpse into her future. \"In a way Clark, Earth has always been my home like you said. It has always treated me well and provided for me. It gave me the most important people in my life when I thought I would be all alone or dead. I can learn to become human without abandoning who I really am. Kara and Linda can live alongside each other. Kara is my heritage but Linda is who I am now. With your guidance, I know that I will eventually learn how to continue to be both human and Kryptonian. My future has always been bright. I just refused to see it.\" She told him as they walked together out of his office. Clark put her in a cab and waved her off. He looked in her direction long after the cab had disappeared form human view. She was headed into a future that only she knew about and understood, and he would always be right beside her with unwavering support. ********** Ethan could never get used to living in the house alone. Linda went home to Clark's apartment after resting at the fortress. Without her in the house, it was simply too big for him. Every nook and cranny of the house held a special, now painful memory for him. She had kept her distance from him during the graduation party Clark had thrown for her. He would have to accept that everything had changed between them now. It would never be the same again. He was about to go up to bed when he heard some rustling noise at the front door. Hearing the door unlock, he opened the hallway closet and got his baseball bat. He swung the bat the minute the door opened. \"Ethan! It's me!\" Linda caught the bat in midswing. Crushing the wooden rod like a hard boiled egg in its shell. \"Linda! What are you doing here?\" he felt a sudden rush of happiness. Linda was vacationing with the Lane's as far as he knew. Just until her college studies began in the fall. \"I need to talk to you.\" she had a note of uncertainty in her voice. \"What's wrong?\" He asked as he followed her into the living area. \"Can I move back in?\" she asked with the fear of a negative answer visible on her face. \"You know you can.\" he beamed at her. She smiled at him and kissed his cheek. \"I'll move back in as soon as I can. There is just one thing.\" \"What's that? All your stuff are still in your room.\" \"I don't want separate rooms anymore.\" she was shaking in nervousness while she spoke. Deep inside, she knew she was ready. This was the right thing for her to do. What? Was he hearing right? \"Clark would tear me limb from limb if I allowed you to do that.\" he could already imagine Clark going into superman mode if he caught them doing a horizontal dance in bed. \"He knows my plans.\" Linda teased Ethan. \"Plans?\" His interest was teased. Exactly what was she leading up to? \"Ethan, a wise woman once told me that I know I am ready for marriage when I can't see my future without you beside me.\" \"And?\" he was waiting for the rest of her story with baited breath. \"And ---I've come to realize that I can be everything I want to be. I can achieve everything I ever dreamed of but, I won't be able to do it alone. I won't be happy. I won't be a complete person without you by my side.\" \"So....?\" \"So, Mr. Logan, I'm asking you to take me back. As your best friend, your girlfriend, your lover, and your wife. Will you have me?\" She was still wondering if it was normal for Earth girls to propose marriage but decided that since he proposed first, she should not expect him to do it again. She had looked away from him in embarrassment. Her cheeks were flushed from the anticipation she felt for the answer to her question. What if he said no? What if she had totally blown her chances to win him back ? What would she do without his love to guide and support her? \"Kara, look at me.\" he touched her chin and guided her face back so that she faced him. His eyes were filled with happiness and love. Using his thumb, he lightly traced her soft lower lip ever so slowly so that she took slow deep breaths while sighing in rhythm to his motions. The answer was clear as he held her face up to his so that their lips met once again. The electricity they both felt within the kiss told them both what they already knew but needed to confirm. Ethan would never leave her. Their hearts will always be one and at home within each others souls. Kara's heart was now finally home and would never be separated from Ethan again. When they finally parted, Ethan could not bear to let her leave the house again. \"Spend the night in your room? Don't leave me tonight. \" he practically begged her as he buried his face into her neck. Taking in the scent of the woman he had missed for so many days and nights. \"Make sure you don't sleepwalk.\" she reminded him as their lips came together for another deep kiss. ********** The civil ceremony was held at City Hall with their closest friends and family in attendance. They made for a small group. Just the Lane's and Clark with Jimmy along. For safety purposes, the rings ran through Kal-El's Kryptonite scanner before the wedding. The bellboy helped them get their things into their honeymoon suite at the Metropolis Hotel that night. Ethan did not even try to carry Linda over the threshold. The bellboy had a questioning look on his face as he and Linda walked into the room hand in hand. \"I have a bad back.\" Ethan lied as he handed the bellboy his tip and sent him on his way, closing the door behind him. \"You have a bad back?\" Linda pushed him onto the bed and jumped on beside him. \"Oh yeah, it really hurts.\" he kissed her softly while he leaned over her and reached to turn off the main light control switch. Linda was already messing with his shirt buttons at the same time. The desires that they controlled within for each other over the years they were separated first by location and then by differing social traditions burst forth like a tidal wave. They acted upon their urge to unite their bodies and souls in the ultimate act of love and possession. The starlit night glimmering just outside their window bore witness to the explosion and satisfaction of the desires that bound them in life and in love.

Moviencopyrights and tr"},{"Movie":"Burlesque","Title":"Welcome to Burlesque","Author":"I-love-u-long-time","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305502","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is just something I thought of last year after seeing Burlesque, I saw it and just thought 'there really isn't enough Alan Cumming in this' 1 minute and 20 seconds is far from enough, especially when he's supposed to be one of the people starring in it, ANYWAY before I start rambling this is an Alexis/OC fic, please R&R;! This is my first Burlesque fic so please no flaming, if there's any criticism then please make it constructive Disclaimer: I don't own Burlesque or any of it's characters, I do however own Tina and around half of another character who will be introduced in later chapters She was like a perfect porcelain doll, bright eyes shining under dark grey-brown makeup and thick, lengthened eyelashes, waves of sunlight gleaming through her long, dark brown hair, that killer teasing smile, framed by a profound scarlet. Her petite body bent over with her backside swivelling seductively, pulling the audience (the majority of them being men) further into her bewitching dance with the two women beside her, as if they were drunk on the simplicity of seeing her before them, and further still when her body brushed against those of her companions. He had his back held firmly against the windowless wall, with his arms crossed over his chest, and watched her, as he would anytime he had the opportunity, not daring to take his eyes way from her, and found himself leaning toward the stage each time she swung her ass or slowly pulsated her chest. He saw her eyes flicker to him, and they shared a loving smile, as he eagerly waited for her dance to end, impatiently wanting to fulfil his nightly desire to have her long, luscious legs wrapped firmly around him. As the music intensified she looked back out to the audience with a flick of her hair and a sway of her waist, keeping an eye out for any man who appeared would spend extra for a private performance. Her eyes glazed over when her thoughts took over, and she smiled lightly to herself when they turned to him, and she thought of how lucky she truly was, to have found a love such as hers, to have his full support over her career choice and whatever decisions came with it, and that she was able to see him both at their home and at work. He shifted himself back against the wall with a muffled chuckle, only to feel his heart race with relieved excitement when her movements began to slow down. He wove himself between the few people passing by the bar after stealing a final glance at her captivating form, willingly making his way to meet her backstage. She gave the audience a final teasing smile as the music gradually slowed to a stop, and gave them a flirtatious wink when she struck a rather intimate pose between the two girls, listening to the cheers and applause as she graciously stepped down from the stage and pushed past the waiting performers at a quick pace so she could desperately meet her lover in the change rooms. A childlike grin played across her face when she spied him before her vanity, staring down at her makeup and an unfinished glass of whiskey and gin, no doubt left by Nikki. She made her way over to him, silently but for the sound of her heels against the floorboards, and draped her arms around his, planting a soft kiss at the back of his neck, before she was pulled in front of him and embraced into a tempting, much more passionate kiss.[Chapter 2] Hope you all enjoyed the prologue, I don't really have much to say about this chapter except don't ask about the nickname, it's all I could think of, hope you enjoy it. Please review! :D Sean briskly pushed through the girls, looking for one girl who seemed to have vanished in the last 10 minutes, and beginning to worry until he had found one of the few girls who would know where Tina had gone. \"Georgia!\" he called out to the small red head, \"Yeah?\" she responded, leaving her conversation, and quietly cursing as Coco and Jessie started laughing hysterically, \"Where's Tina? She has to step in for Nikki. Three guesses why,\" he sighed, rolling his eyes at the mention of Nikki's name. \"I saw her go up to the change room before, with Alexis,\" she giggled with a playful wink, \"Oh no, she's going to become another Nikki,\" Sean groaned, before climbing the stairs. After the two years he'd had to get used to catching the two together after one of Tina's routines, he wasted no time preparing himself for the worst when he heard soft moans erupting from the entrance to the change room, though after two years he wasn't sure what he considered the 'worst' anymore. Sean crossed his arms over his chest with a raised brow when he found Tina pinned against the wall, her leg held around Alexis' waist as he kissed her neck, his pants down around his ankles beside Tina's underwear, which had been dropped to the floor, and he cleared his throat, stealing their attention. \"Sean!\" she cried, flustered, as she unwillingly pushed Alexis away and hurriedly pulled on her panties, careful not to hook the thin material around the thin heel of her shoes, a small, embarrassed smile spread across her smeared red lips when she saw the mocking concerned look Sean had given them. \"Get dressed, you're on in two minutes,\" he stated, gesturing toward the lingerie appearing costume decorated with black lace and silver silk Nikki had carefully hung over the top of her vanity mirror. \"You might want to clean yourself up a bit first.\" Finally finding the ability to use her legs without stumbling, Tina quickly followed Sean through the hall, \"But, I've always done the more complicated dances, what-what if I stuff it up?\" she nervously pleaded, not noticing the sickly smug smirk on Nikki's face, or that she had pulled at a loose thread hanging from the side of her corset as they'd passed her. \"You'll be fine,\" Sean assured her, \"it's nothing new. Just get out there, dance, mouth the words and keep looking gorgeous.\" With that, he pushed her forward with a persuading pat on the behind and watched as she put on a flashy smile while the audience cheered excitedly, and more so as the slow jazz number began to quicken. Her body twisted and turned in flirtatious patterns, secretly pleased that she did not have to share the spotlight with anyone else, before moving toward the edge of the stage, lifting her leg high and slapping her ass with each step. Adding playful smiles for a more innocent look, and throwing her head back when the vocals gasped. Her hands started sliding along her body, not knowing that the thread Nikki had loosened had gotten caught under her nail until less than half of her side had unravelled. She immediately held her arm across her chest before her corset could fall, and looked down out of embarrassed instinct, though she quickly saved herself by hiding her naked chest behind one of the ostrich feathered fans before reaching her hand through and wagged a finger at the audience as if it were a part of the performance, relieved when they began to laugh cheerfully, before grabbing a second fan and using it to cover her bare back if she were to turn it on them. Nikki's lips pursed when she leant her weight over to one leg, viciously angered that Tina had worked her way around her attempt to humiliate her, and those idiotic people watching her from the floor were buying it! Honestly, you have to be the stupidest person on earth not to notice the whole fan act was not a part of the act! She thought as she rolled her eyes and turned away with a loud huff, catching sight of Alexis watching Tina close behind her, \"I see that slut's ruined two of our nights,\" she mused bitterly, taking in his not too familiar frustrated expression, which quickly faltered into an annoyed sigh, \"What do you have against her? Honestly, how is it you can find a fault in every single person you meet?\" he asked her, clearly tired of listening to her constant bitching, \"Are you serious? She's a stuck up bitch who's stealing my job-\" \"Because she doesn't get here an hour late and smelling of whiskey and gin every night,\" Alexis cut in, \"You really are the most hypocritical person I know,\" \"Oh please,\" Nikki scoffed, rolling her eyes, and made to leave for the bar, \"Yeah, you are. All you do is sit on your ass, drink and sleep with the guy who's trying to buy us out,\" \"Just look at that,\" she cut in, staring at the silver haired middle aged man reaching out for Tina's thigh, \"she's not even trying to stop him,\" \"Look at that . All you ever talk about is how great you are and shit talk about everything else,\" he stated, \"Whatever,\" Nikki purred, brushing a lock of her dark chestnut hair behind her ear, \"Just tell your precious little Tina to keep her disgusting hands off my songs,\" she responded sharply, before storming off with another childish huff. Feeling a strange adrenaline rush flowing through her veins, Tina boldly left the stage, flicking a few stray hairs back over her shoulder, clutching the torn corset to her chest, with an aggravated frown she marched her way to Sean, who until then had been checking on the following dancers, \"Sean! That creepy pervert tried to feel me up again!\" she exclaimed, stamping her foot as if she were a child having a tantrum, \"I thought you said you were going to ban him from the club,\" \"I know, Tina bear, we're trying. He keeps finding a way of getting back in. Looks like you've gotten him hooked.\" \"Well, how can I un hook him?\" she demanded, \"How could anyone let you get away?\" he claimed, perking her head up higher, \"Come here.\" He grabbed her by the wrist and lead her upstairs, seating her at her mirror, \"Look there,\" Sean muttered, holding her hair back out of her face, \"you have a beautiful face, you should show it more often.\" Blushing lightly, Tina smiled, he dropped a hand to her shoulder and lowered his head closer to her ear, \"There we go. I thought we lost you for a second.\"[Chapter 3] Slight spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet in this chapter! I'm not too happy with how it turned out, but there's always that one chapter you don't necessarily (omg I think I spelt that RIGHT for once! :D) like, you know? But yeah, the next chapters are better, in my opinion. Please review! Tina let out a deep, exasperated sigh as she threw herself down across the bed, finally able to get off her feet, and allowed herself to sink into the mattress. She closed her eyes and let out a pleased moan, but found she was far too comfortable to move, though her feet were killing her. She groaned slightly and stretched her neck over the blankets beneath her, \"Alexis!\" She heard the distant sound of heavy footsteps leading to the doorway before he was seen leading against the frame with a tired raised brow and his arms crossed over his chest. She batted her eyelashes as she looked up at him with a young, innocent smile, \"Take my shoes off?\" She giggled at his unchanged tireless expression, but closed her eyes again when he gave in, letting out a pleasured sigh when she felt his hands on her skin. Her eyes shot open at his hand now gripped tight around her wrist, and she screamed a spirited laugh as she was swiftly pulled face to face with his kneeling figure, \"No! My feet hurt!\" \"You aren't on your feet,\" he countered, an amused smile spread across his lips, a light blush crept up t her cheeks at her mistake, \"Well they hurt anyway – are you wearing my eye shadow?\" she questioned, eyes narrowed suspiciously as she saw the familiar dark blue over his eyelids, \"You know I couldn't find one of my bras today. You wouldn't happen to have taken it behind my back, would you?\" \"Do I look like I need your underwear?\" he chuckled lightly, \"You never know. Your look's gotten so much more feminine lately,\" she stated, looking wy with a mischievous smirk, and lightly pushed him away. \"I'll have you know that this look is just as manly as anyone else's,\" \"Yeah? Tell that to my missing bra.\" Her words were cut when he brought his lips to hers, she smiled into the kiss as she slowly moved her arms behind his neck and parted her lips, her eyes fluttered shut one final time, and in those few elongated moments, she felt all worries she might have held wash over. She sprawled herself on her back, her shirt and shorts now in a small pile close to his, and both on the floor by the foot of the bed. \"I missed you, baby,\" she murmured, breathless, and smirking when his lips rejoined hers. She held her arms over his and dug her nails deep into his back with a panted gasp when she felt him course through her with a strong, confident thrust. Her head turned when he slowly moved down her neck, brushed against his hand delicately, felt as though heroin had been rushing through her veins. His other hand slid down to her waist, and he cupped her side. Her body clenched as his rhythm pulsed, before it eased and she arched her back, grinding against him, jaw dropped wide, nails still piercing his back, screaming anticipated moans as he pushed further. One last groaning, gasped moan as the warmth of his shuddering breath brushed against the side of her neck and his weight collapsed against her. When he moved, she wrapped herself around him, her head against his chest, cradled in his arms. The sunlight beamed over Tina, Georgia, Coco, Scarlett and Jessie as they stood before the choreographer, watching as she showed the five a new dance, a fast paced number Tess had called Wagon Wheel Watusi. She had a certain glow to her appearance, and was in a way relieved that she had been chosen over the other dancers, though not surprised. She had after all been one of the few girls who'd worked at the club since the start, and one of the most talented. The light flickered once as she waited outside the toilet cubicle, a saddened look of pity as she listened to Georgia heaving what sounded like all of her stomach's contents, \"Honey, are you alright? Do you need me to hold your hair back?\" Tina asked, concern evident in her voice, \"No-no...! I'm fine,\" Georgia groaned between coughs and chokes, before the flush was heard and she staggered out, with a pained, uncomforted look as she harshly coughed. \"You know you have to tell him, and Tess. They're going to notice eventually,\" Tina stated, \"I know, and I-I will,\" Georgia anxiously stuttered, \"just give me some more time,\" \"I'll tell you what, don't think about it tonight. Go out there and be your usual happy self and when you're ready talk to Tess about it. She'd know what'd be best.\" She sat before her vanity, stroking a light pinkish-red blush across her cheeks while Sean combed back her hair, tying a small knot at the back of her head to give her a small poof-like look. When he stepped back, she got to her feet, modelling the silver sequined dress which ended mid-thigh, excited that they would be dancing the debut for Wagon Wheel Watusi after Tess begun the night, \"How do I look?\" she asked him, her voice filled with childish enthusiasm, \"Gorgeous,\" Sean answered, looking Tina over, head to toe, admiring his work, \"Just one thing,\" he muttered, before carefully picking a fallen eyelash from her cheek. \"There, perfect.\" An amused smile crossed his lips when she cheerfully hopped on the spot, her heels clicking against the floorboards, when the club owner's feint singing subsided. She downed the last of her vodka and coke to calm herself and shared a friendly kiss on the cheek with him, careful not to rub any of her lipstick off onto him, before eagerly bounding down the steps.[Chapter 4] This here's the start of the movie's plot, with the introductions to Marcus (f**king dick) and Ali :D please review! The spotlight beamed over her, reflecting off the silver of her dress, making the sequins gleam and glitter brightly, showing the dimly lit silhouettes of the four girls behind her, not perfectly seen until the band sped up. Looking out to the audience with her signature smile, she saw the regulars, the people who came every so often, though over at the opposite side of the floor there was a new face – a young, blonde, her naive appearing innocent face watching them closely with interest. She made her way between the tables to the bar, never taking her eyes away from them until Jack took her attention. Tina shook the thoughts, the girl was only another person who found their dances intriguing, nothing new. She looked down to the table in front of her, her eyes glaring daggers at the greying haired man, sitting back with two women on either side, smirking and winking at her. She rolled her eyes slightly, though her smile never faltered, and simply ignored him, as always, wishing that somehow his drink ended up being poisoned. She burst through the side door, her face contorted into an annoyed frown as she stormed up to the 34 year old ass in front row. \"What the hell do you want, Marcus?\" she demanded, hands on her hips, \"You know what I want, beautiful. But since you asked, a scotch on the rocks would be great,\" he answered, an arrogant smirk on his face, \"Then tell one of the waitresses or get it yourself,\" she retorted, \"I could do that...\"Marcus began, leaning towards her, \"But then I wouldn't be able to talk to you.\" \"Well see the problem there is, the other person has to want to talk to you. Bummer,\" she groaned in mock disappointed, giving him a brief insensitive look before turning her back to him. \"Wait, wait, wait. Why don't you let me take you to dinner tonight?\" he suggested, moving to stand. \"You can't be serious,\" Tina scoffed, raising a disbelieving brow, \"Can you not see just how much I hate you?\" \"Oh, I am, and I can. But it's never too late to change your mind,\" \"I disagree. It is far too late to even consider thinking any more of you,\" she said, walking away from his table, rolling her eyes when she heard a hurried 'I'll be right back' and his chair scraping across the floor,. \"Come on, Tina. Let me take you out,\" Marcus pleaded, a playful innocent look on his face, \"I will not take no for an answer,\" \"Really? Well, someone's going to be surprised tonight,\" she sighed, \"Nothing has to happen. We can have a little get-to-know-each-other night out.\" He stepped in front of her, and gave her his otherwise perfect smile that, for any other girl, would seal the deal, but she simply raised her brow waiting for him to finish, \"Are you done?\" \"Come on. I want to take you out. I only want the best,\" he murmured, inching towards her, a sincere glint in his eye. She pushed past him, and called over her shoulder as she went backstage. \"Then your best girls must change all the time.\" She sat at the side, with Coco and Jessie and a glass of tequila, lemon, lime and a small amount of absinthe, talking about Marcus, throwing in the occasional insult, \"He asked me to dinner again,\" she moaned, taking a small sip of her liquor. \"Again?\" Jessie exclaimed, \"Mhmm. And get this,\" Tina started, crossing her legs, \"He said – he said he wanted to take me out, and that he only wants the 'best' of anything,\" she claimed, \"as if that would make it any better for him.\" \"He's the guy I've ever met in my life,\" Coco cut in, \"No wonder Nikki has the hots for him,\" Tina blurted, \"it's physics. Assholes and players attract bitches and sluts. They're perfect for each other.\" She opened her mouth to continue when the blonde from the front room nervously walked by them, attracting the attention of anyone who took the time to notice her. \"Who is she?\" Jessie hissed in a low voice, \"I don't know, and I don't care,\" Coco mused. They quietly murmured between themselves, stopping only when the girl looked at them, a shy, yet suspicious expression filling her eyes. When she caught the last few drops from her glass on her tongue, Tina stood, brushing down the front of her dress, and placing a hand on Coco's shoulder when she began to sway, \"I don't know, but she seemed to be getting close to Jack,\" she announced with a mischievous grin. \"Anyway, I'm going to see Alexis.\" She laid back across the bar, her legs dangling over the edge, once again dressed in the dress she had arrived in, noting the few men who tried to peek up her legs, with a new emptied shot glass by her knee. The sound of a door closing took her attention, without moving she looked behind, and quietly let out a groan when she saw Marcus strutting to her. She hastily swung herself around and sat up, and, grabbing the front of Alexis' shirt, who had only just passed her arm's reach, and pulled him between her legs, dragging one up and down his body, wrapping her arms behind his neck, letting the fingers of one of her hands grasp his hair, moving her lips to his ear. Whispering in a light breath, \"Take me home,\" while sparing Marcus a gaze as if only just realizing he was there seeing it all with a grim, envious frown. And finally, sliding down to her feet and following her lover outside.[Chapter 5] I've been watching Sucker punch today and almost immediately thought of a new thingy to put in this and based a new character off of Blue Jones, the fantasy version, with the moustache (most moustaches are hot!), except not as angry or you know, gun friendly. If anyone doesn't know who he is there's a link to a picture of him on my profile. Reviews people! Disclaimer: I still don't own anything from Burlesque, and around half of new guy (I'm deciding between two name choices, so far Johnny is winning) The following night, the blonde, Ali, a girl who Tina learned had moved from a small town in Iowa, was seen once again, working as a waitress, wearing a revealing all black outfit. She made her way backstage, and, seeing the two staring between the curtains, went up to Sean and Nikki to see just what they were watching. \"What's she doing here?\" Nikki demanded in a hateful voice, as she glared down at Ali working her way through the tables, stopping to hand out the drinks that filled her tray. \"I want her gone now!\" \"What'd she do to you?\" Sean asked her, poring over a failed body suit having lost interest on the floor, \"..She called me a man,\" she grumbled, \"Can't be the first time that's happened.\" He paused to give Tina a quick look when she failed to hide a giggle. She rolled her eyes when Nikki flicked back her hair and left in a tantrum. \"So how come you're here? Alexis unable to perform tonight?\" he asked, giving up on the so far unfixable costume, \"For your information he is too busy to perform,\" she replied, \"Half of the crowd seems to have all come at once,\" \"You should be used to that,\" \"Bitch,\" she smirked, hitting his arm playfully, crossing her arms when he gave her a strange look. \"Of course, have we met?\" Ali carefully balanced the once again full tray on one arm as she slowly opened the side door, serving the drinks one at a time as she saw the dancers, though unable to lose the last. \"Excuse me,\" she said softly, tapping one of the girls' shoulder, unsure whether it was a good choice when she received an warning look, \"Um, have-have you seen Tina?\" she asked, curious, but confused, when the girl's displeased look quickly changed to an amused smile and pointed to the stairway. \"She's up in the change room.\" She peered around the stairway's railing, gazing into the change room's entrance when she heard the sound of playful laughter, and overheard a voice giggling with a pleasured murmur, \"Mmm, you've never done that before,\" and a man's quite groans. Letting curiosity take the best of her, though bracing herself for what she could be seeing, Ali carefully began to creep her way closer to the voices. She silently thanked god when she saw a woman come into her view, fixing the lower half of her outfit, and untangling parts of her hair, recognising her as one of the lead dancers from last night, and realised what she had missed when a heavily made up man soon followed her. \"Are you Tina?\" Ali asked shyly, \"The one and only,\" the girl answered, confidently striding her way, \"That for me? Thanks, honey, you're a doll,\" she grinned, taking the glass before Ali could answer her. 'Uh, were you – were you two just...\" she began, unable to finish, \"Didn't your mom ever tell you it's rude to eavesdrop?\" Tina exclaimed, wiping at the corners of her mouth, \"I'm sorry, it's just hard to ignore when you have to go to the source,\" Ali muttered, scratching the back of her head, \"So, Tess really doesn't care that you – you know?\" \"Tess? She stopped caring after the second week when she realised it wasn't going to stop,\" she stated, \"Look, honey. If you can't even talk about it, then this really isn't the place for you.\" Since she hadn't had another dance until later in the night, Tina spent the remainder of her time at the bar, face in her palm as Jack dried off a shot glass, \"So you and Iowa, hm?\" \"What?\" Jack asked through nervous laughs, \"It's obvious you have a crush on her,\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" \"Come on, whenever she's around you can't keep your eyes off her,\" she stated, grabbing a number of bottles and a glass from beneath the counter. \"I don't have a crush on her,\" Jack retorted, \"I'm getting married to Natalie,\" \"Please, she's been in New York for how long now? Almost two months? I can guarantee that she has hooked up with at least one guy since she got there,\" \"She wouldn't do that. Anyway, back to the point. I just met Ali last night, we're friends.\" \"Oh, Jack you poor baby. You can be so adorably clueless,\" she smiled, pouring the alcohol into her glass without looking what she had taken after pinching his cheek lightly, \"Whatever happens, as long as you're happy. Just don't get hurt.\" Black laced lingerie, fishnets held up by a garter belt around her trim hips, tall, black heels strapped around her ankles, black gloves reaching her elbows, dark make up for her eyes and lips. Her look was finished by the diamonds clasped around her neck and her wrist and the stage smile which glowed under the bright blue light that showered over Georgia and herself, though the former position would normally be filled by Nikki who had once again arrived late and drunk. They shared an encouraging smile before Marilyn's voice was heard throughout the room, starting their dance filled with split rolls and high kicks, and capturing the audience's undying attention. She looked through her long black eyelashes, her eyes smiling suggestively as she bent down low in front of Georgia, her legs separated, feeling the tops of Georgia's thighs pressed against the sides of hers, and her arms wrapped around Tina's waist, holding her up, and kept that pose. She gazed out to one of the front tables, occupied by five new people, all but one of them being men, though her eye was immediately drawn to one; a dark brown haired man, at most in his mid thirties, a long pencil moustache over his lip; and stayed on him. She was certainly familiar with men's eyes lingering over her, that was well known even before working at the club, but not in the way his eyes were fixated on her. Never leaving her or her body, never flinching, never taking as much as a blink, as if he was taking all that he could of her into his memory, and keeping her in the back pits of his mind. Even when the lights were out and you could not see her clearest detail, he never dared take his eyes from her black silhouette until she had stood upright. She kept watching him as she followed Georgia backstage, watching as he went and spoke with Jack. She worked her way between the girls rushing to get ready, and passed by Sean, ignoring his attempts to stop her, and pushed through the side door, keeping an eye out for that man who seemed to feel as though they were the only two in the building, wanting to find out who he was. Feeling disheartened and disappointed when she'd seen he had disappeared. \"Jack!\" she called, not knowing how loud she's been speaking through her dazedness, \"who was that?\" He looked up from pouring himself a drink, his brow furrowed slightly, \"I don't know,\" he shrugged, \"He just came and asked who to talk to about private dances,\" \"And?\" \"That's it, I told him to talk to Tess and he left,\" Her eyes fell, looking straight ahead into the mirror behind him, \"Huh.\" \"You should talk to her if you want to know any more.\" She looked back to him with half dead eyes, and mumbled a hushed \"Yeah,\" to herself mainly, as she turned away.[Chapter 6] Right, first off I would like to give a special thank you to MarineDevilDogWife for the wonderful reviews! Keep them coming, let me know wht you all like, what you don't, all that jazz. Secondly, this here had Blue's first bits of dialogue :D and thirdly, there is some quite graphic adult happenings at the end of this chapter. So hope you're all enjoying this so far, please review! \"Tina!\" She stopped in her tracks, pausing to look through the few people in front of her to Tess' office, and saw Sean waiting for her a short distance from the door still slowly swinging back and forth. \"Congratulations, Tina bear,\" he stated when she reached him, a sincere proud smile on his lips, \"you've hooked another one. He's inside with Tess, demanding to have a private performance from you,\" he said in a low voice so as not to be overheard by them, taking in Tina's curious expression, \"They're negotiating a price now. Tess won't go a dime under 60,\" \"That much?\" she asked, her voice dripping with shocked surprise at how much her employer thought she was worth, \"You're the star of the show, baby, you work hard enough to get to the top it starts paying off. By the looks of things when I left, I'd say he's about to crack.\" \"Wait, I have another dance soon. I can't go with him now,\" she remembered, shaking her head as she began to back away, \"I know, we'll work it out,\" he assured her, \"Can't you get someone else to dance for him?\" He shook his head no, \"He's refused anyone else Tess suggested, he only wants you. He's enamoured with you.\" He looked over his shoulder, making sure they were completely out of earshot, then added, \"I'm jealous, this one's a looker.\" Her eyes set on Tess' door, as if she could see the two of them through it, and narrowed slightly, \"Yes he is.\" With his back to the bar, Alexis leant against the counter, keeper a watchful eye out for any sign of Tina, becoming confused and tense when he could not find any, and more so when Georgia had gone out instead. \"Hey, Jack? You were talking to Tina before...you know where she went?\" he asked, unsure whether he should worry, \"She's in Tess' office. Some guy wants a private session with her, he seemed sort of, attached to her too,\" Jack mentioned, a warning grimace over his face, \"I'd keep an eye on him if I were you.\" Alexis' jaw dropped to argue against him, that Tina wouldn't have agreed to dance for some suit, when he saw her leading a man to the backroom, no doubt the one Jack was talking about. His face hardened when he saw the guy's eyes concentrating on her back, and, unknowingly, his fingers clenched around the edge of the counter when they repeatedly fell to her waist, down to her hips, to linger on her ass. \"It's fine, perfectly fine,\" he said through gritted teeth, he could almost hear the intentions running through that clearly overly narcissistic guy's head as Tina closed the door behind them, he turned away from them with a spiteful glare, \"give me the strongest drink you have.\" \"Alexis. Tina's a smart girl, nothing's going to happen with them, she'll know that what you have would be way better than what he could give her,\" Jack told him, \"I've known guys like him my whole life and they're all the same. Used to get anything they want when they want it, if they don't get it they start crying to someone who'd give it to them. She wouldn't want that.\" He responded with an uncertain, sarcastic \"Sure,\" before pushing himself upright, \"Forget the drink. Don't worry about it.\" He sent the backroom another hating glare before leaving for the front desk, not sparing anyone the gratification of a backwards glance. She leant against the wood of the door, her arms behind her back as she locked it, and keeping her seductive stance and flirtatious smile, she stepped out to the middle of the room, which but for the old small leather sofa backed against the wall, speakers in all four corners, and a standing lamp that filled the room with a dim orange light, was otherwise empty. \"Tess has told you the rules here? No violence or any actions that may cause harm to any of the dancers, no unwanted and/or offensive catcalls, and of course the one man of the men have trouble following, look but don't touch,\" she stated, briefly dropping her suggestive manner as he followed her with a keen grin, \"Now...\" she regained her alluring demeanour with her hands on her hips, \"Make yourself at home,\" she purred, pushing him down to the sofa before starting the music, and stood before him, close enough that he could reach out and touch her thigh if he chose. She smiled, though whether it was because she had the chance to earn more money or that she was pleasing him she was not sure, and her chest heaved, along with her legs, until he got to his feet in an overwhelmed rush and pulled her face to his, forcing her into an overpowering, lusting kiss. Her hands grabbed the back of his hair, and though he'd taken this as a sign to go further and push his tongue between her lips, she held his head further from hers. \"Have you already forgotten the rules?\" she asked him, shocked, uneven breaths escaping from her as she gained her professional composure and backed away from his towering form, \"Look but don't touch.\" He grabbed her by the arms and pinned her to the wall, ignoring the surprised grunt that came from her, \"Tina, right?\" His voice was smooth, though a hint of danger was evidently hidden deeper within. She closed her eyes, taking in a firm breath as she felt a strange new pleasure from being held beneath his strong hands, something she was not used to from Alexis. When they opened, she allowed herself to show her pleasure with a manipulative smile, \"And you are...?\" She raised an expectant brow at his increasingly desiring smirk, \"Blue Jones,\" he finally answered her, not bothering to hide his self importance. Once again he'd attempted to kiss her, and once again she'd had to pull his head back, \"You have one more chance, Blue. If you break the third rule one more time I'll be forced to have you thrown out,\" she purred, looking him in the eye. \"There are no windows in this place, right?\" he claimed, brushing the back of his hand down her cheek, causing her to shiver slightly under the cold metal of the ring around his little finger, \"no one has to find out.\" \"Unless I decide to tell them,\" she retorted, giving him a brief smug smirk. He brought his hand to her face and snatched her jaw, keeping her eye on him, \"I paid good money for you,\" he stated, inching closer to her lips, \"So until you get out there again, you're mine,\" \"You paid for a dance from me,\" she corrected, keeping her bold yet calm serenity, \"And I'll be deciding what you'll be doing,\" he finished, running a hand along her arm. Her eyes narrowed as she though it over, but eventually she recoiled and nodded curtly, \"What dance do you want?\" she asked him, though knowing what his answer would be. He grabbed her hand and dragged her after him, spreading his legs and pulling her down between them when he fell back to the sofa. With the music still playing she gave him another suggestive smile and positioned herself over him, holding her hands against his shoulders, feeling his hands cup her waist, swinging her hips side-to-side, grinding them across his legs, his thighs, to meet his. But removing herself when she felt him stir between her legs, muttering in a single flustered breath, \"Your-your time's up,\" and bolted out to the front room. Not noticing the reluctance to let her go in his eye when he stood to go after her, or the pained pleasure as he slowly sunk back down and opened his fly, and slipped his hand down the front of his pants.[Chapter 7] I'm not too happy with how this chapter ended up, for the most part, there's one part of it I do like, that I had quite some fun writing. Wrning, there is one mid length light graphic loving in this chapter, other than that it's fine, and other than that there is no Blue in this one. Please review! Let me know what you like, what you don't, you know. :D She'd found Alexis in the main hall, his glassy eyes looking at the pictures covering the walls without really seeing them, for a second they'd dropped when he heard the clinking of her heels hitting the wood of the floor. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked him, worried that he hadn't been in the front room, wrapping her arms around him when she saw he was anything but happy, \"What's wrong?\" she asked softly, propping her chin onto his shoulder, groaning in surprise when he'd wrenched himself away from her, \"Alexis, what's wrong?\" \"Nothing. Everything's just fine. Just dandy,\" he spoke in a flat voice, taking a brief, emotionless look at her, \"Don't tell me you're fine. You are not fine. So talk,\" she snapped, immediately following him when he pushed past her, \"Alexis!\" She grabbed his wrist, holding him back with a concerned frown when a thought crossed her mind, \"It's because I danced for that guy, isn't it?\" \"I hate it when you take them to the backroom!\" he finally exclaimed, making her jump in shock at his sudden outburst, \"I hate it. I hate sitting back, knowing what they'd rather be doing with you – but unable to do anything about it. And...and I hate that you let it happen,\" he admitted, lowering his voice toward the end, \"You hate it when I go to the backroom?\" she questioned, \"Why? You don't trust me. Is that it?\" \"No. You could walk in here wearing nothing at all and I'd trust you. It's them I don't trust,\" \"If you did trust me then you wouldn't hate it, because you'd know I wouldn't do anything with them. I love you , Alexis, not them,\" she assured him, letting out a relieved sigh when he kept her hands behind his neck, though a jealous anger still filled his eyes. She took a step back and ran one of her hands through her hair, \"Look. Let's just go back out there for the last half hour, we'll go home and we'll relax – we'll just..lay in bed for the rest of the night or something.\" He didn't say anything, but he gave her a weak forced smile and a single curt nod, and though she knew he was still silently raging, she smiled childishly when his arms hesitantly grabbed her. His lips left a burning sensation on hers when he kissed her, the insinuation of cigar smoke washed over his wet tongue as it took over her mouth. His hands, which had been cupping her breasts, fell loosely to her waist. His touch made her blood rush excitedly, violently. She bit his lip, before throwing her head back with a dropped jaw, her hands pressed down into his shoulders, her bent back leaning over him, otherwise silent moans passing her lips when her hips began to rock with a slow, though stronger, rhythm. Her arms wove behind his back and she pulled him up to face her, holding both of their sweat ridden bodies together. He brought his lips to her neck while his confident hands travelled lower, grasping the back of her thigh, trailing kisses down to her shoulder, to her collarbone, before firmly planting them on her chest. She found herself winding around him tight, closing any gap that may have been between them, her fingers clenched in his hair. He held his head back, revealing the intensely pleased smirking face, not Alexis', but Blue's. A moment went by where they looked into the other's eyes, but it was ended when she brought her hand to his cheek, and held her lips against his in a meaningfully passionate kiss. Her eyes opened and she brought her hand to her forehead, only to remove it when she noticed her skin was hot and wet, relieved to find herself in her own bed. The dream had left her with mixed emotions, she had to admit that she found Blue attractive, though he was clearly a dangerous man, to those on bad terms with him at least, his confidence, charm, smooth talking and danger drew her to him, had her interested. Those fifteen minutes, which seemed to have been noticeably prolonged, had been more than enough to capture her curiosity, and more than enough for her to crave his tense, violent intimacy. When she found herself sinking further into her thoughts of Blue, she turned to her side, wanting to talk to Alexis to distract herself. She cried out quietly when she saw she was alone, somewhat distraught as she thought he may have left her while she slept, though she quickly dismissed it when she remembered he had decided to spend the night on the sofa. She peeked out into the living room from the open doorway, and saw him laying peacefully on his back, before silently creeping across the cold wood floor to stand beside him. She knelt down and desperately shook his arm, all the while hissing, \"Alexis!\" Not stopping until she saw his uncomfortable stirs. \"What?\" he groaned, furrowing his exhausted brow, appearing to have forgotten his crisis. \"Come to bed,\" she pleaded, \"I'm lonely. I need to talk,\" \"What time is it?\" he asked, slowly sitting up, \"I don't know, early,\" she shrugged, \"we need to talk,\" \"Now?\" \"Yes,\" \"Tina, I'm tired, it's still dark out,\" he complained, yawning, \"We need to talk about us. And earlier,\" she stated softly, but firmly, \"Alright,\" he sighed in defeat, giving her an insensitive smile, \"go ahead.\" \"You can't keep getting jealous, you're getting worked up over nothing. Those guys, all they are is extra money, they aren't getting any special treatment. It's my job, I go out there, look pretty and dance. And if the time calls for it I give them a private performance. You know their limits and so do they, all this...\" she blurted, gesturing to the sofa, \"is unnecessary. Alexis, it's only going to be you and me, no one else, for the rest of our lives. But if you can't keep yourself from reacting like this we can't stay together.\" She got to her feet, a solemn look on her face as she stared down at his blank expression, \"I don't want to leave, but it you can't even stay in the same bed as me because of your jealousy I'll have to. Unless you want me to, then it would be much easier for to just tell me than to wait for me to get fed up and go.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" he quietly responded, \"No?\" \"No. I don't want anyone else,\" he admitted slowly, softly choking as he struggled to find the right words, \"I'm, sorry.\" \"You'll try to control your anger?\" she asked, a determined behaviour now taking over, \"Yes,\" \"So will you come to bed?\" she held her hand out and waited for him to take it, letting out a sigh of relief when he had. \"You know Blue means nothing to me, right?\" she murmured, resting her head on his arm after she'd helped him up, \"Yes,\" \"Good.\" She breathed, who it was she was trying to convince she didn't know, whether it was Alexis, or herself.[Chapter 8] I know it's been AGES since my last update, school, bad mood swings and unhappy and stressed moods are not a good mix. But I finally hve chapter 7 up, and I'm currently working on chpter 8, hopefully I'll have that done and up soon. Anyway, there's some not so romantic, but hot action between Tina and Blue ;) it'll get better as it goes on, and that goes for Alexis as well lol. Also, I realized that Ali hasn't been in it that much, so to make up for that she's back in this one :D. Reviews please! Let me know what you like, what you don't, what I could improve on, all that jazz! :D Disclaimer - I don't own anything from the movie Burlesque or the character Blue Jones, I only own Tina She hadn't been able to get back to sleep after retrieving Alexis, causing her movements to become noticeably slower, and much less graceful, than the music, despite her many efforts to keep it otherwise. As expected she found Blue seated front and centre, his eyes stuck to her in a knowing smirk, but she ignored him, and kept her mind on keeping an attractive smile and making the correct steps, or if she were offstage, to keep her mind at ease. Though every so often, she found him creeping through the barriers of her thoughts and she would share a swift look that lasted no longer than a second She struggled to keep still when the band struck its last chord, feeling her legs and her arms begin to shake uncontrollably. But she fought the urge to straighten her back and forced herself to stick to it until she was allowed to stagger offstage, where she made her way to the bar, \"I need something to wake me up. Give me something with caffeine,\" she drawled between a yawn, not watching as Jack mixed her drink, though she recognised the smell of vodka, gin and coke when she raised the shot glass to her lips, but her sip was cut short when she felt a hand on her shoulder strain her around to see into the angered face of Blue. She smiled and raised her glass in a greeting, \"It's always good to see regulars. Well, most anyway,\" she claimed, stealing a quick side glance at Marcus laughing with his usual group of women half his age, rolling her eyes when he caught sight of her and gave her a casual wink. She took a long gulp of her drink, the alcohol mixed with the lack of sleep already making her feel tipsy, \"So serious,\" she grumbled, furrowing her brow playfully, \"did someone wake up on the wrong side of bed?\" she asked him, speaking as though she was with a child when his anger hadn't faltered, \"What's gotten you so unhappy?\" He took her free wrist, not noticing or caring about the warning glare Jack threw at him when he led her to the backroom, the one place the music would drown out almost all noise they would be making. He locked the door behind him, and swaggered over to her, snatching the glass from her when she made to drink from it, \"Hey! Give that back now!\" she shouted, swinging her arms out to take it back, though he simply moved his hand back out of her reach, further with each of her attempts, \"You can have it back when we're done,\" he stated in a less than comforting voice. He placed the glass on one of the sofa's flat arms, then pinned her to the wall with her arms over her head, held in one of his hands, before she could grab it. A menacing grin stuck to her face when she felt his grip tighten, and the alcohol begin to flow to her head. \"You want another little kiss?\" she purred against his opened lips, keeping her face inches away from his, \"Okay, but you should know I have a boyfriend just out there so we'll have to be quick.\" Her brow furrowed in confusion when he refused to claim her mouth. \"You know, when you ignore me, especially after a long, fucking hard day, it's disrespectful, and very upsetting,\" he told her calmly, running a hand down her cheek, keeping her face in place, \"But you aren't a disrespectful girl, are you, Tina?\" A gratified smirk played over his face when her body shifted beneath him, twisted with an arousing pleasure when his fingers closed around her jaw and let his lips hover over hers, gave a breathy, alluring laugh when she felt his hot breath hit them, pushed her waist back to the wall, \"Not unless you want me to.\" \"Exactly. And you know I'm not a man to be messed with. The one time you fuck up, it's over, I don't give anyone second chances, you're gone,\" he murmured, lightly brushing his lips against hers, \"And frankly, I don't give a shit if you have a boyfriend. I told you last night, as long as I'm here you're mine...you're mine.\" An excited moan was silenced when he kissed her, their open mouths mirroring each other's movements. His tongue licked her lip before roaming her mouth, leaving her with the mixed taste of cigar smoke and a number of mixed alcohol when he broke the kiss, far too soon, just as he had begun to slow down with tempting desire, just as her disoriented want was beginning to be fulfilled. Only realising now that his whole body was pressed against her, standing between her legs. \"Don't forget that, baby doll,\" he scolded, dropping his hands from her, allowing her arms to clench around his neck. She pulled back with his lip between her teeth, her eyes sparkling devilishly as she peered into his dark brown ones. \"As long as you're here, I'm yours.\" She clumsily made her way back to the bar, every few steps pausing briefly to keep herself from crashing to the floor, finding Ali laughing with Jack. She cleared her throat, gaining their attention, \"What?\" she snapped when the waitress looked at her curiously, trying to figure her out, \"Aren't you in relationship with the host?\" she was asked, the blonde's voice soaked with confusion, \"What's it to you?\" Tina demanded, crossing her arms over her chest, \"So why are you going into the backroom with some other guy?\" Ali then asked, \"And leaving with your lipstick smeared over half of your face?\" \"Listen here, Ali . I was dragged into the backroom, I had no choice in the matter. And it's none of your damn business what I do with my personal life. Besides, it's just a little fun,\" she remarked, with an amused smirk, \"It's not like you can talk anyway, look at you, flirting with an engaged man,\" \"We weren't flirting, Tina,\" Jack told her over his shoulder, \"we were having a perfectly innocent conversation,\" \"Oh come on, Jack! Stop denying you like the girl,\" she slurred, \"What did you put in my drink?\" \"Just vodka, gin, coke and lemon. You know you shouldn't drink when you're tired, it only makes you drunk faster,\" Jack claimed, \"I'm not drunk. I'm just – still tired,\" she cut in, \"And drunk,\" \"And drunk,\" she nodded, \"wait...no, not drunk. I'm not drunk. I will climb onto the bar and show you all how not drunk I am!\" she stated, slamming her palm flat on the counter before attempting to use a stool as a step, though unable to keep her unbalanced feet from slipping from the finished wood of the seat. \"Oh yeah, you're completely sober,\" Ali mused, a judging smirk on her lips as Tina looked back to her, \"I am,\" she huffed, \"I don't have time to waste trying to get you to believe me. I have to get changed for the next song.\" \"Don't go out there again, Tina, you could hurt yourself,\" Jack started, \"Take a rest in the change room and sleep this off,\" \"I'm not drunk! I'm tired, but when I get out there I'll be awake,\" she slurred, backing away from them, \"so you, two..stay here, and don't try to stop me!\" \"Where the hell are you, Tina!\" Sean muttered under his breath as he searched for the girl, \"You have one more minute before I get – Tina! There you are!\" he cried, bringing a hand to his chest as he calmed himself, \"Here I am!\" she announced, almost tripping over her feet, \"I'm not too late am I? What's wrong?\" she asked him, now seeing the stern frown on his face, \"You're drunk,\" he said, \"Not you too!\" she complained, \"I'm not drunk. I can prove it, just let me go out there and I'll prove it,\" she exclaimed, \"No, no. You'll only ruin your fabulous reputation. Go to the change room and – sleep it off until you're better,\" \"But – \" \"No buts,\" he scolded, pausing to stop a passing Coco, \"Coco puffs, go out there for Tina, will you? And you,\" he then said, turning back to her, \"Go.\"[Chapter 9] I'm quite proud of myself, I didn't expect to get this chapter done tonight, I stayed up lter than I'm supposed to to get this done and I have school tomorrow so I think I deserve a few reviews for this, don't you? Anyway, this starts the further storyline between Blue and Tina, finally, so yeah. Reviews! Please! :D Disclaimer - I don't own anything from the movie Burlesque or the character Blue Jones, I only own Tina A hand on her arm shaking her vigorously had her regain consciousness, and her eyes fluttered open for her to find Jessie standing over her. She sat up, only to clutch her forehead when a throbbing pain shot through her head, \"How are you feeling?\" she asked her softly, \"Not too good. Alcohol and exhaustion is not a good mix,\" Tina groaned, \"what time is it?\" \"A few minutes before midnight. We're just starting to clean up. You should get dressed,\" \"I was out for three hours?\" Tina asked, incredulously, \"Shit!\" \"It's alright,\" Jessie smiled, \"Tess was a little annoyed, but Sean told her how you had a bit of a um..rough night last night,\" \"Huh. Is-is Alexis still downstairs?\" \"Yeah. He's waiting on the floor. Are you good to get dressed? Do you need any help?\" \"No, thank you.\" She pushed herself to stand, holding herself up with her mirror. \"Oh, and before I forget,\" Jessie started when she made to leave the room, \"There was a guy asking for you earlier, he said to tell you a uhh...Blue Jones was looking for you,\" she said, producing a folded strip of paper, \"he said to give you this. I think it's his number,\" she giggled, a child-like glint in her eye when Tina grabbed the paper from her hand. \"The girls and I are going to get some sushi. You want to come with us?\" Tina brushed down the front of her jeans, carrying herself as she gently swayed when she changed her heels, and tied her shirt around herself, \"No, thanks. I'm just going to go home and go to bed.\" She let out a slow, relaxed breath as they shared a small smile, \"Well, get better soon, sweetie.\" Heated water rushed over her bare skin, dripping from the ends of her hair, steam rising in the air, filling the closed in room with no way of escape. She was pressed to the wall of the shower, held by him, her leg around his waist, held in his hand. His lips, switched between being held against her own lips and her neck. Her nails clawed his back, dug deep into his skin, as she held him against her, and felt his pulsing rhythms heaving inside her legs, varying the amount of her he filled with each powerful thrust. When she woke she clenched her fists, throwing them against the mattress in aggravated frustration. And flipped herself onto her stomach, draped over Alexis' body, a suggesting smile set firmly upon her face when he eventually joined her. \"Tina? What do you want?\" he yawned, looking down at her through unmade eyes, spying the fun loving fire burning within her own. She bent down to meet his lips, touching them with a light, enticing brush of a kiss, breathing against them in a low murmur, \"I want you.\" She ran a finger along his chest, and kissed him, biting his lip with a satisfied laugh, but let go when she felt his hands on the sides of her face remove her mouth. \"Now? What is it? 2:00 in the morning? Aren't you tired?\" he sighed, struggling to keep up his effort to keep her back. \"I was asleep for most of the night at the club, I've had my rest for tonight. Until we're done,\" she grinned, carefree, yet rebellious and stimulated, and laid her hands to rest just below his shoulders, and kissed him, and he let her, and hesitantly let his hands travel down the sides of her body, slowly removing both sets of underwear. Turned her onto her back. Listened to her giggle as his lips slid down her neck, making sure he hit every mark. Listened to her moan as he slipped inside. Watched her as her eyes shut, and her head drift into his pillow when he sunk deeper. Lifted her from her back with a grunt as he made his first thrust. Lifted her from the bed and held her against the wall as he continued. Felt her fingertips sink into his flesh when his movements grew stronger. She threw her head back, opened eyes scrunched as she moaned and gasped helplessly, and finally groaned breathlessly, \"Blue...\" He came to a sudden stop, immediately pulling away and sinking between the bed sheets, and turned away from her with a blank emotionless stare. \"What's wrong?\" she breathed heavily, \"You said Blue,\" Alexis remarked darkly. Her eyes widened, silencing her alarmed anxiety, thankful for the fact he could not see her. \"-No I didn't – \"she stammered, sounding less confident than she would have liked. \"Yes, you did. You said Blue,\" he sneered, shifting further from her. \"No, I said 'you',\" she claimed, though she knew he didn't believe her, \"I was saying 'you are amazing'.\" \"Please, how stupid do you think I am? Just admit you said another guy's name, it's not a big deal,\" \"If it's not a big deal then why are you getting so mad?\" \"Because you're lying about it, it's actually insulting that you think I'd believe it when it sounds nothing like 'Blue',\" \"Baby...\" she made to wrap herself around his side, but her arms were held back before they could properly grasp him. \"No. You stay there, dream about Blue . And I'll be here.\" \"Alexis – \" \"Just say that you like the guy, admit it,\" he snapped, suddenly turning back to her. \"I don't like him. I don't like anything about him! How many times do I have to say it? I don't like him ,\" she told him, her voice sharp with building annoyance. \"Why can't you say it? It's the truth, we can all see it, admit it,\" \"Fine! I admit; there's a part of me that finds him attractive!\" she yelled. She hadn't planned on saying it to him, she hadn't planned on telling anyone, but the growing jealousy and the blazing anger that came from it had finally become far too much for Tina to live with a second longer. \"But that's it. It's nothing, I don't want to be with him, Alexis, I want to stay with you!\" She moaned when he stayed silent, simply lying on his back, staring into the ceiling with the same deathly glare from the start. \"You need to talk! There are going to be more problems between us the longer we stay together, and if you don't start talking to me they aren't going to be fixed, they'll only get worse until they're too difficult for us to handle. So start talking!\" \"You want me to talk? Fine, I'll talk. I don't believe it, you think he's attractive, I don't believe that's it. I don't want to see you with him anymore,\" he growled dangerously, \"It's my job! I'm a dancer! I can't just refuse to dance for someone just because you don't like it, if I did that I would've been fired years ago. You can believe whatever you like, it's the truth. I don't like him, he's a revenge crazed ass, he said so himself earlier, I don't want to do anything with him and I never will. I want to stay with you, Alexis, but if you can't let it go I'll leave through that door right now. You say you don't want me to go, but if you didn't then you would believe me over anyone else, if you didn't you wouldn't be acting like this, so make up your mind. Do you want me, or not?\" she demanded, preparing herself to remove herself from him. \"I want you to stay. But I don't want to see him again,\" he finally answered, slowly beginning to soften, \"We can't ban him from the club, he hasn't done anything wrong, he knows it. You're going to have to live with him being there,\" she stated, laying back, though turning her back on him. \"I'm going to sleep. You can do whatever you want tonight.\"[Chapter 10] This chapter annoyed me quite a bit in the last few weeks, writers block is quite the b***h. But eventually I came up with an ending, sort of, I could have made this one longer but if I did it would've gone on for AGES, so I've put it into two parts, and I admit, I rushed the ending to this part a teeny bit, I want to get to the Blue romancing as quickly as possible! The song in this chapter is from the musical Nine (which I absolutely LOVE), and you would all be better off if you saw the actual performance on youtube to see the whole 'dance' actually goes. Anyway! If you want to review that would be most helpful, this is one of my stories that your opinion could improve. AN - I saw The three musketeers yesterday, and the minute I saw Orlando Bloom as the Duke of Buckingham I just HAD to write something for him, and I've also gotten a HUGE Lord of the Rings obsession (for the millionth time) and am thinking of writing a Legolas story along with that. So the updates for this story may be even worse than they've been lately. But who knows? We'll have to wait and see. Disclaimer - I don't own anything from Burlesque, I don't own Blue Jones (but god, if I did...) and I don't own the song 'Take it all', I do however own Tina and any other new characters you see here \"Please, Tess. Let me do 'Take it all', I need this. Surely you've been on the verge of killing a guy!\" she begged, following the mother figure like a lost puppy, \"Please! I need to let out my emotion!\" Those were the words which got her in front of her mirror, wearing the simple black dress that hugged her small curves, and her strong hips perfectly, and the silver elbow length gloves along her arms. A cold look in her eye as Sean pinned back her hair. \"Trouble in Tina's paradise?\" he asked her over the chatter of the girls behind them, \"Worse than ever,\" she growled, \"That's an understatement, her and Alexis have been at it for the last four nights,\" Nikki cut in, outlining her eyes, \"I don't blame him, I'm surprised he's lasted this long with you,\" \"Stay out of it, Nikki, no one asked for your opinion,\" Scarlett shot, elbowing the back of her head when she passed her chair, though Tina paid no mind to the brunette. \"Is it Jones?\" Sean softly whispered, quiet enough that no one but Tina could hear. She stayed silent for a moment, focusing on straightening her dress before answering in a dangerously flat voice. \"It's everything. He gets jealous over everything lately and I'm sick of it.\" She turned to face him, her face blank, \"So now I'm going to give him something to be jealous about.\" Music flooded the room, a slow swing beat carrying throughout, but no recorded voice. \" Not with the recording,\" Tina commanded Tess, her eyes filled with a determination. \" You can't be serious,\" the club owner scoffed, hoping that it was only an act, \"You can do the song, but you aren't singing.\" The older woman stood to leave, but the younger girl grabbed her wrist and pulled her back around, \" Tess,\" she spoke before the woman had a chance to shout at her unacceptable behaviour, \"I have to do this!\" The lights shone red, reflected off the mirrors behind her, making it seem like the flames of hell dancing around her. And her eyes, filled with a scorching fury, burning with the frustrated hatred, similar to the raging hatred she revealed when she began to sing. A feint hint of a sinister smirk crossed her as she refused to give even a passing glance toward Alexis, not gracing him with her acknowledgement, knowing the intensity of his own anger boiling inside. Loving the feeling of ecstasy as she could almost feel it growing while she danced, with an elegant seduction, and let her hair down when she'd stripped down to her racy lingerie, and fed Alexis' anger with a teasing smile aimed at the man he hated most. Unfastening her brassier, hiding a satisfied laugh when he moved closer to her, his eyes concentrating more than ever, silently begging her to remove her arm from her breasts. His desiring gaze never faltering from them until she was out of sight, brassier in hand. The men's jeering whistles and cheers becoming louder when she had bent down to grab it, exposing the swells of her breasts bulged over the sides of her arm. She had stormed out of the spotlight almost immediately, needing to get out of any man's proximity, or any man who spend countless hours reattaching sequins and lace to bits of eye grabbing cloth. She didn't stop to answer anyone who asked whether she was okay, just continued to stomp upstairs, a flat blank glare remaining, to slip a light silk robe around her shoulders and let herself fall to the small seat by her mirror. Elbows leaning on the desk, she buried her face in her hands, unable to fight the mixed tears threatening to envelop her. She sat upright when she heard a set of light footsteps at the doorway, expecting to see Coco, Jessie or Georgia, and wiped her hands beneath her eyes before her makeup could properly run down her face when she saw Ali. \"What do you want?\" she demanded with a sniff, \"you want to insult me? You know, kick me while I'm down? Make me feel worse? Too late, I already feel like complete shit.\" \"I just thought you might want a drink?\" the blonde said, holding out a glass of clear liquid for her. \"Is this a joke? You wait for me to take it and then mock my drinking?\" Tina snapped, pausing to stop new tears from shedding, \"That's not it, I saw that you were pretty unstable out there so I thought you might want some . . . support,\" the blonde coaxed, \"You want to talk about it?\" Her voice was soft, comforting, as she stared down at her with a pitying glance. \"What would you know about it? You're just a small town girl,\" Tina grunted, \"You probably had the perfect life and perfect guy,\" Tina sobbed, eventually snatching the glass, \"You glamorize us small town girls way too much,\" Ali mentioned with a small laugh, \"There's a reason I left Ohio.\" \"Yeah? And what was that?\" \"I was stuck at a dead end job that would have taken me no where, I wanted to be a dancer and there was no way I could do that there,\" Ali started, \"But that's not the point. You know I once had this boyfriend who was an absolute ass. I mean, I couldn't even go out with a couple of friends because they were guys and he'd get jealous and possessive. I knew that we wouldn't work so I go up to him with my bags packed and I tell him that I'm leaving,\" she pulled up a seat beside Tina, \"So he tries to win me back, saying that he'll change, but I don't listen and slam the door in his face without another word. Not all relationships work out, no matter how hard you try.\" The corner of her mouth flicked to a quick smile as Tina nodded slowly, barely moving her head. \"So how are you and Alexis going?\" the blonde then asked, laying a gentle hand on Tina's arm, who let out a saddened sigh, \"Terrible,\" she answered before draining her glass' contents, \"I love him more than anything, but sometimes I . . . sometimes I wish we never got together.\" Her eyes widened when she realised how she had just sounded, \"I mean, the last week have been worse than anything we've ever been through, it'd kill me if we ended it. If we never got together we wouldn't be here now, and I wouldn't be sitting here and slowly getting drunk.\" She locked eyes with the blonde for a short moment and left her glass alone on her desk when she turned herself to face her. \"I want to fix things between us, but I don't know what to do,\" Tina cried, letting Ali move a comforting arm around her shoulders. When a knock interrupted her sobs, she dabbed at her eyes, thankful to see Georgia approaching her with open arms. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yeah, I'll be okay. Ali's helped me,\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes,\" Tina smiled weakly, \"I'll be fine.\" \"Okay. If you want to talk about it you know I'm here,\" Georgia assured her, though an uncomforted look quickly replaced her smile, \"Blue's asking for you. It looked like he was ready to get you himself when I saw him.\" \"Tell him I'm busy, I can't see him now,\" Tina groaned, fighting the temptation to hide away. \"I tried my best, but he won't listen. He's demanding to see you. I only just got him back to his seat. But, I don't think you want to go out there right now . . . \" the red head said. \"Why? What's happening?\" Georgia hesitated, unsure what to tell her, \"Well – after you left the stage, Tess was talking to Alexis - \" she started, though was cut off when Tina suddenly stood and marched out of the room.[Chapter 11] Chapter 9 is now officially complete! :D Yay I've finally recieved a new reviewer! Thank you so much SleepyWolf2365, I am so glad you hate Blue, he was just made to be hated, except he was actually one of my favorite characters in Sucker Punch :S lol Anyway! I have plans for the next chapter, and I will start writing it ASAP! Though I may throw out one or two of the points, we'll see how it goes, I may write a little hidden chapter sort of thing. So! Much appreciated if you want to review. I'll do my best to reply to as many of them as I can. Disclaimer - I don't own anything from the movies Burlesque or Sucker Punch, I do however own Tina and any other new character you see She knew what she was about to see, still she had not prepared herself, to see Alexis holding himself firmly against the two contortionists, putting himself into incredibly intimate positions with them. She found her breath escaping in short wisps, her anger flared, and shattered her newly regained common sense when she saw him twisting into every possible arrangement one could imagine, and just over half they had achieved together, to the audience's amusement. She lost herself in an animalistic rage. She wanted to hurt him, every fibre of his being, and she knew how she could when she saw him, laughing away with the rest of the crowd. A sinister smile crossed her lips as she strode to him, and sat across his lap with her bare legs crossed and her hands linked behind his neck. And without a second wasted she leant in to him, crashing her lips over his. And all she could hear was the sound of the music mixing into the laughter as she sunk every bit of effort and passion into the heated kiss. At first Blue was shocked, having been taken by such an immediate surprise, but within a moment he had settled, and placed his hands on her; one at the back of her head, gripping he hair tightly, while the other trailed up her thigh, beneath the folds of her robe. She quivered when his thumb rubbed the inside of her leg, but her moan was muffled by his tongue. She could taste him, along with the whiskey and smoke. She grasped his hair and pulled away at the light but shrill twang of a triangle, and spoke in an alluring breath against his ear, \"You're taking me home tonight.\" She went backstage with the intention to corner Alexis and let out the last bits of her anger, before her rational mind could take the opportunity. She caught him by the staircase, and when he faced her she struck him, with as much strength as she could muster, across the cheek. \"I hate you, I really do,\" she exclaimed, without caring who had heard, ignoring the few people she had attracted, \"After that I despise you! What the hell was that? I was going to apologise and suggest we find a way to work us out. I regretted everything that happened, but now.\" She paused to give him a scathing glare, \"You can just go to hell for all I care.\" He shook Georgia away when the red head tried to restrain her, \"Wait, you're getting mad about what I did out there?\" he asked her, \"Why? It's just job, isn't it?\" \"No, Alexis. You're the host. You let people in, let them out when they want to leave, and kick them out when they get out of hand. You don't perform.\" \"Tess asked me to, I had to,\" he said through gritted teeth, \"Oh don't give me that shit! You went out there to get back at me! And you know it.\" She screamed at him, causing the small crowd gradually grow around them. \"You think that you're a better person, and that you're more mature, but really you're no better than I am. You're a child, and I can't deal with it anymore!\" she cried, now allowing Georgia to leave a hand on her shoulder, \"If this is how it's going to be between us, we aren't going to work out.\" He dropped his gaze for a moment, but when he looked back up he was no longer angry, but hurt, \"So what do we do now?\" \"We need to take a break.\" \"So, that's it? We're over?\" She shakes her head, blankly, \"We've been over since the start, we've just been too stupid to notice.\" She turned away from him, unable to deal with the rush of emotion building up inside, leaving her head spiralling out of control, and left him before she could see his final reaction, to find the one woman who could help her calm her nerves. She was found there, sitting behind the desk of her office, pouring over papers with her fingers through her long black hair, a near empty glass beside her elbow. \"Tess?\" Tina's voice had become soft, her vulnerability clear as she slowly stepped toward her. She let out an exhausted sigh when she looked up at her, revealing light tear stains beneath her eyes, \"It's nothing for you to worry about,\" she choked, answering Tina's unasked question, \"What do you want?\" \"You're the strongest woman I know, Tess. You haven't had a man since Vince and you're perfectly fine with that,\" Tina started, \"So you wanted advice on your own love life,\" the older woman finished for her, \"So you two finally ended it?\" The brunette blushed lightly, \"You heard that?\" \"Honey, I think the whole club heard you,\" Tess laughed quietly, with a weak smile, \"Oh.\" Tina sat down in front of her, embarrassed and confused, \"Well, yeah. I need your advice. Tell me what to do?\" she begged, her eyes pleading for her help. \"Blue's caught your eye, hasn't he.\" Her smile faded with that statement, being replaced by a stern frown, \"You don't like him.\" \"I don't trust him,\" Tess told her, \"There are good men out there, who want to keep you happy, and safe, and loved. And there are bad men, like Blue. You'll learn who you can trust and who you can't. I know I can't tell you what to do with your personal life, but I want you to be safe. If it were me I would stay as far away from him as possible, but you're a smart girl, you'll make the right decision for yourself.\" Tina nodded slowly, sadly, \"What about Alexis?\" \"That's all up to you. Can you see yourself with him in the long run? Maybe get married and pop a couple of kids out with him?\" She laughed softly, \"I used to, but now . . . no, not anymore.\" The older woman gave her a comforting smile, and reached over with a motherly hand. \"There's your answer.\"[Chapter 12] Have you ever thought that you'll eventually get over a guy, but then that one moment you see him, no matter how long or short the moment is, you realise you never will and all you want is to be with him? Well that is made much worse when you're sure he doesn't feel the same, and IMO, that hurts much more than if you were to get together and break up for whatever reason. But enough of my recent feelings and occurences, this here is chapter 10! Done and ready for your viewing pleasure :D Nikki is back! :D God I used to hate her, but now I just love her! (lol) Anyway! As always, if you want to review it would be much appreciated SleepyWolf2369 - Nawww you like Tina x Alexis! Well, don't worry because I'm sure you're going to like how it all ends out. Now I'm going to stop talking before I reveal the whole thing lol He'd watched her, as she was taken through the club in the shielding arms of Sean, who had been muttering soft words of comfort to her as impassive tears rolled down her cheeks every now and then. Nikky was with him, flirting her heart out in a way that was on the verge of becoming desperate, though he wasn't listening to her. He hadn't seen that other man; who had taken every bit of her free time for himself, anywhere near her, and it brought a self-assured smile to break out across his face. Raising a hand to scratch his chin through the stubble over his jaw, he left Nikky before she had a chance to finish talking, and made his way to her when they stopped at the bar, and Sean had to leave. She hadn't seen him lean his arm against the counter; to which Jack turned a sneering eye from him the second he'd seen the man, staring at the side of her head intently, as if burning a hole through her skull, until she noticed that he was beside her, where it quickly changed to an inquisitive smile. \"Can you not give me a moment of peace?\" she growled, rolling her eyes as she crossed her arms, \"Honestly, do you have some kind of radar on me? Tina might be feeling shit, it's time to sweep in and make it even worse?\" \"What?\" He chuckled amusedly, \"No, no. I came here to talk,\" \"Oh please!\" she scoffed. \"Look, I couldn't help overhearing your little . . . falling out, with Alexis earlier -\" \"In this case meaning, you heard our fight and pulled up a seat right outside?\" She turned a cold glare onto him, \"I wanted to take you out,\" he continued, ignoring all of the derogatory insults Tina could throw at him, \"You need to go out, have some fun,\" \"I need to relax,\" she countered, \"You can, when you get home. But first, come on.\" She stayed quiet, she wanted to argue, but she was in no mood for it, so with a defeated sigh she surrendered. \"Fine! But no flattery, no touching, nothing that might be taken in the wrong way.\" He went to grab her hand, but she immediately pulled it back, \"I'm serious, Marcus. The second you try anything with me you will lose your little friend,\" \"I get it. Nothing will happen between us,\" he assured her, taking her hand when she allowed him to lead her outside. \"It'll be a night for you to loosen up, where we can get to know each other.\" It was no later than 9:30, but the night sky was already pitch black when they reached his car. The wind lightly brushed through her hair, and she shivered as it hit the bare skin on her arms and chest, it had been a warm day, and she hadn't expected to leave the club early, so she hadn't worn anything other than a thin wrap around shirt with a pair of jeans. \"You cold?\" Marcus asked her, smiling amusedly when he gave her his jacket. \"Thank you,\" she said, just above a whisper, as she draped it over her shoulders. Her hair ripped through the breeze as they sped through the streets. She ran her fingers through it before facing him, \"Can we just make one quick stop first?\" A sneer was plastered over Nikki's face as she sat by her mirror, cold hatred filling her veins as she stared at her reflection. The brown haired slut had stolen her rightful place as the Burlesque Lounge's star, a position she had worked hard for, and Marcus from her. Even Tess, one of the few people from the club she considered a friend, was beginning to stray. Their friendship meant a lot to her; it had been Tess who picked her up before she could land in the street when she had no one left, Tess who had taken her into her home and cleaned her up, Tess who had given her a job. Tess who forgave her for being a complete bitch, and allowed her to stay at the club. She knew that she would not be able to cope without the older woman, and she knew Tess knew it too. She was like Nikki's mother, though if she ever told Tess that, she knew she would most likely lose her head. An anxiousness crept into her eyes as she delved deeper, if she didn't have Tess' friendship she would have nothing, she would be nothing. She knew that the club owner's tolerance with her actions was beginning to crack, it was only a matter of time before she could no longer deal with her all together, and if that were to happen she did not know what to do with herself. She was a professional dancer, perhaps she could use her experience to find herself another job, however, she knew that the chances of another employer settling for her catty and stubborn ways wasn't high. A hand reaching for one of the lipstick tubes from her vast collection tore her from her worries, and she turned to the side to see Jessie, \"Can I borrow this for tonight?\" An irritated and angry glare suddenly lit up her features as she snatched the golden tube out of the blonde's hands, \"Don't touch my stuff!\" She sat back against the leather seat, a small, blank sheet of paper in her hand while Marcus dropped the last of the boxes into the trunk of his car, the backseat already covered. She had wanted to leave a note for Alexis, but when the time had come she realised she had no clue what she wanted to say, or even if she wanted to resort to as much as writing to him, and she had decided to leave it for Alexis to find the house emptied of her belongings instead. She shivered lightly when a sudden wisp of the cold night air hit her body, and pulled Marcus' jacket tight, closing it around herself. He smiled, softly, as he took his seat beside her, \"You okay?\" His voice had taken on a soothing murmur, instead of the eagerness he'd had when he was persuading her to spend the night with him. She took in a breath, before nodding and facing him, \"Yeah,\" a bitter frown returning to her, \"Just get me out of here.\"[Chapter 13] So it's been a little while since I last updated, but I'm over the writer's block, and now I have two new chapters :) Blue isn't in either, but he will be back in the chapter after next. I got a new reviewer, so thank you so much! You guys are the best, and the more I get the more inspired to continue I am :D Disclaimer - I don't own anything from the movie Burlesque, only Tina, but god I wish I owned Alexis ;) She sat in front of him, looking out at the numerous other couples around them with a disappointed scowl, as she unwillingly waited to be served. \"Why did you take me here?\" she grumbled, turning her unhappy gaze to Marcus, \"I thought you were taking me out.\" \"We are out,\" he said with a laugh, taking a moment to look back over his shoulder to see if a waiter was coming their way, \"I thought you meant a club, or at least a bar,\" she pouted, grabbing the wine glass that was placed before her, \"You expect me to drink nothing but wine till I get home?\" \"How long do your dinners last?\" he laughed at her immature glumness, \"We won't be spending the whole night here,\" \"You could have just taken me to the bar just down the road from the club.\" She slumped back into her seat, \"You have to eat something,\" \"I can eat when I get back to Georgia's,\" her arms crossed over her chest, \"I'm starting to regret going out with you instead of Blue. He would have just taken me out drinking.\" \"The pretty boy? I'm sure he would've,\" he agreed with a small grin, \"There's a bar across the road, we can go after we eat,\" \"God when did you become my father?\" she exclaimed, rolling her eyes, annoyed, \"Fine. I'll eat something, but the second I'm finished I'm going there, with or without you.\" One hour, and four glasses of wine later, she stepped through the bar's doors, knocking people out of her way as she marched, swaying on her feet lightly, to collect her prize. \"Give me a vodka martini, shaken. And keep them coming.\" I turn away from the bartender as he begins mixing the alcohol, turning a blank stare to Marcus when he takes the stool beside me, \"You weren't lying when you said you'd leave with or without me,\" he breathed a chuckle, \"Did you suppose I'd wait?\" she raised a brow, \"I'm still here with you because I want to have one night without caring about anything, that doesn't mean I hate you any less.\" She nodded a thank you when she took her drink, \"If you got to know me you wouldn't,\" he stated with an arrogant smile, \"Really?\" she questioned, sarcasm dripping from her lips, \"And why's that, Marcus?\" \"We're two very similar people.\" At that her eyebrows disappeared beneath her hair in disbelief, \"It's true, name something and I guarantee we share that little feature.\" \"Oh please, we have nothing in common. I actually want meaning in my life, I want a loving relationship with someone who cares about me, someone who will love me despite my faults and who respects that I won't be changing for anyone,\" she started, lifting the toothpick from her glass, and tapping the liquid from the olive, before slipping it between her teeth, \"You on the other hand go out having one night stands, and never call the poor girl who spent a night with your bigheaded ego after you've kicked her out of your bed.\" \"There's a good reason for that,\" he told her, leaning his elbow against the counter, \"And that is? You can never find someone you care about going about the way you are,\" \"Exactly,\" he granted, \"and there's no way for me to get attached to whoever I'm spending the night with. You don't get attached to someone you don't get hurt if they ever leave. And the sex is always a plus,\" he grinned, roguishly. \"You don't want to find someone you could spend the rest of your life with?\" she asked him, her brow furrowed. \"If it happens it happens, if it doesn't I don't let it bother me,\" he shrugged, \"How can you not care about being alone? Are you that self-centred you don't care about living your whole life without anyone caring about you? Maybe even loving you?\" \"I don't see the point, I mean, why look out for love when I have cold blooded hatred right here? A light hearted laugh escaped from her as she exchanged her empty glass for a new martini, \"But still . . . You haven't ever fallen for anyone? Never?\" \"Of course I have, but as hard as I've tried I can't get over them,\" he muttered, \"Who is it?\" she asked him curiously, choking on her drink when he gave her a meaningful look, \"Please . . . that isn't going to work on me,\" she said between coughs, \"You don't love me, you love my body.\" He let out an annoyed groan when she refused to look at him, \"For once can you believe that I'm not just thinking of myself and actually telling the truth?\" \"I'm afraid I can't. I've seen too much to believe you.\" \"I care about you, Tina,\" he cut in, \"I don't know how I can make you realise it, but I know you have some sort of feelings for me, whether or not they're the same as mine.\" For the first time since she had met him, Marcus had left her speechless. She took the toothpick between two fingers, stirring it through the alcohol. \"Just get drinking.\" She didn't know how many drinks she'd had, but before she knew it, her normal calm sentences had become loud shouts and obnoxious laughs. They'd moved from the bar to a club further inside the city, howling out thunderous laughs when either fell to the sidewalk, and she was now throwing herself to the vigorous beat of the music. Keeping close to Marcus, and clutching onto his shirt tightly so he couldn't escape. His arms wrapped around her, and she closed her legs around his waist as the last of the alcohol took her over. She snatched his jaw, closing the space between them, and crashed their lips together, holding onto his face while trying not to dig her nails into his skin. His tongue slipped into her mouth, which she allowed, and greeted by licking it with her own until they both pulled away. And staggered outside to his car with eager intentions to get to a bedroom.[Chapter 14] So this chapter was inspired by HowlynMad's review, hopefully all of you Alexis/Tina fans enjoy it, it starts off the later chapters I have planned, which I won't go into further detail because I know I will give away WAY too much (lol). So as usual, reviews will be loved :D Disclaimer - I don't own anything from the movie Burlesque, only Tina She woke with a groggy start, grunting painfully as she covered her eyes with her hand to block the sunlight, and rolled onto her side, surprised when she felt empty space beside her. She opened her eyes, flinching as the result of her drinking kicked in when she sat up, confused as to why she was in a room that was not Alexis', until the memories of the last night came flooding back to her. Of course she wouldn't be with Alexis, not after they broke up, not after the fight they'd had. Certainly not after what she had done. And she felt a new feeling crossing her, an emptiness she hadn't experienced in years, and a guilt she hadn't felt for even longer. She regretted how she'd acted last night, and the recent nights leading up to it, she should have listened to Georgia and stayed back, where she was safe from any angered rampages. She should have listened to Jack, and Ali, and kept herself at a safe distance from Blue. Blue, the second the name passed her mind she bit back a growl. It was his fault, if he hadn't have asked for a private dance in the first place she wouldn't be in this mess. If he hadn't pushed her further she wouldn't believe that Alexis didn't want a thing to do with her now, though she didn't blame him if she was right. Though she knew that she was just as much to blame herself, she should have gone to Tess about him. If a problem ever rose within the club Tess could get rid of it. And more than anything she should have kept her thoughts of him strictly professional, hell she shouldn't have thought of him at all, with the same no-strings-attached basis she had with anyone else who entered the club. \"You're up.\" A gentle voice grabbed her attention, and she looked up to see Georgia smiling softly, her hair lightly tangled and a cup of coffee held between her hands. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Terrible,\" Tina choked, her voice hoarse, and her throat feeling as bad as she was sure she looked, she assumed it was from her throwing up her whole stomach overnight. \"What happened last night?\" \"You left work early. And came home late, at 2:00 in the morning, I think,\" she sat at Tina's feet, \"You were with Marcus.\" \"Oh, god!\" the brunette groaned, bringing a hand to her head as a new throb of pain passed, \"I don't remember anything. Nothing happened did it?\" \"No, you were out cold when he brought you here. He said you passed out in his car,\" the redhead assured her. \"You had quite a night.\" \"Yeah . . . \" Tina mumbled, looking down at her hands. \" . . . How's Alexis?\" It was the one thing she didn't want to ask, talking about it meant it had anything but a terrible dream. Georgia hesitated, biting her lip awkwardly as she looked away for a short while, \"He's just as bad, maybe worse. He went straight to the front desk and didn't say a word to anybody. Except a few tense goodbyes when the regulars left. Everyone else got the cold shoulder.\" \"Oh god . . . \" Tina slid down to her back, feeling as though she was about to throw up the remaining contents of her gut right then and there. \"He hates me . . . \" \"He doesn't hate you,\" Georgia assured her, \"His heart's broken, he hates Blue because he thinks you're in love with him. You meant the world to him.\" \"Like that's any better . . . \" Georgia stayed quiet after that, but she gave her a comforting smile and placed a hand on her foot. \"I have to talk to him,\" the brunette said, looking up at the other with a low frown. \"Not today, you need to take a day to relax. I'll be out with Damon for a few hours, so get your rest, and if you need anything you can call.\" The redhead got to her feet, and sent her friend a final comforting gaze before leaving the bedroom, though not before she heard a gravelly shout, \"I'm going tomorrow.\" Tess sat at her desk, with her head in her hands, with Sean being her only source of comfort while she heard the audience outside her office becoming rowdy and agitated without Tina on the stage for their entertainment. \"Don't worry about it,\" Sean had told her, \"It's one night. Before you know it, she'll be back and shaking her assets for the crowd. Till then they'll have to get used to her not being here.\" He smiled feebly when he'd gained a weak laugh, even if she knew it was a lie. Neither of them knew how long it'd be until Tina's return, it was obvious that she'd been much more stressed than her usual state during this one week, neither of them knew whether it'd take a day or two, or as long as another week until she had calmed herself. And she worried that during that time the crowd would become smaller than it was already, until it eventually deteriorated into nothing. No crowd meant no money, no money meant she had no way to pay off her most recent, and highest, mortgage on the building, and if she failed to pay it off, she'd lose her club, and the girls, who she'd grown to love as her own children, some closer to her than others, and who she could never imagine losing, along with it. \"Tell me we're going to be fine,\" the older woman pleaded, on the verge of tears as she lifted her head to face Sean, who had moved up beside her and placed a consoling hand on her shoulder. \"We're going to be fine,\" he said, taking the bills from her line of vision, \"We'll find a way to pay it all off.\" She wiped the few tears that had dropped from her eyes, and regained part of her strong composure, \"Tell me a new lie.\" \"You're not gorgeous,\" he murmured. She allowed a small crooked smile pass as she lowered her head back into her arms, \"You're an asshole.\" He smiled, and left her to gain some time to herself, only until she needed a shoulder to cry on. And she knew that she could rely on him to settle her rampant nerves whenever she needed him to. Sean was the one person she could ever reveal her true vulnerability to, and for that she was truly grateful. ","Summary":" This is just something I thought of last year after seeing Burlesque, I saw it and just thought 'th"},{"Movie":"Where the Wild Things Are","Title":"Where I Went For Acceptance","Author":"wildrumpusstart","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9082911","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 : Emily My name is Emily Benson, I'm 18 years old and no matter what my family might tell you. I'm not a moron. I just...I'm gonna be quoting what a resident at a nursing home complimented about me, \"You have an imagination the size of the moon!\" And I have to agree with her, I mean, I knit, I draw, I write, I read, and my inspiration comes from movies and music. One book I remember reading was...oh God, I can't remember the name, but it had these fuzzy monsters and this kid in these pajamas that I asked my mom over and over to buy for me. And the monster I loved the most was the stripes one with the diamonds on his legs and the cat tail. I was once told his name was Moishe, but when I was little, I had my own name for him...it's silly, please don't laugh -Carol. From then on, he was my imaginary friend, we ran through our 10 acre land in the yard and in the woods. When I was sad, he'd be there to cheer me up, when I was angry he'd make me laugh and when I was scared, he'd comfort me. A lot of times, however, in my dreams, I'd be on this small white boat sailing up to this island and I'd feel like there was something...or someONE waiting for me there. I will admit it...I'm in special education, I'm ADHD, I have an EI (or emotional impairment, meaning I don't usually think like I'm my age) and I also have been diagnosed with organic brain syndrome. It's frustrating being like this because...no one takes you seriously! I mean, with my family, every time I have an opinion, and I say it, they look at me like I don't have any pants on. I have two younger siblings named Erin and William, Erin is one of the smartest people I know... I mean put us in a crowded room and she looks like an Einsteinette...I however, look like that loser fat kid that gets picked last on the little league. My brother, William, or Will, he's got problems as well, he's been diagnosed with everything from aspergers to bipolar to ADHD. And his condition is not kind to me or my mother especially, he cuts us down on a daily basis, me especially. Calling me worthless, pig, lard-o, ma-dah, piece of crap etc. etc. It's pretty much like jail rape...the first time, all you can do is lay on the floor, cry scream and hope for it to be over but by the tenth time, you just lay there, waiting for it to be over. Here's another thing I'll admit...I'm adopted. I was adopted when I was 4, and I still have some bad memories from that time. I was molested by my birth mother's boyfriend Mike, who I hate with every fiber in my body. He did that, beat me with a cutting board, and one time, duct taped my hands, feet and mouth together and shoved me under the bed for hours. I can still remember the musty smell of the dust and how I was crying and trying to call for help, but no body came, because no one could hear me and Mike was the only one in the house. Now my birth mother, Dee...I want to go Salem Witch Trials on her! She tried to abort me when she got pregnant with me! She didn't even go to a specialist either! She tried to abort me herself with cocaine! A lot of you are probably thinking I'm over reacting, but you don't know what that feels like, that you're own mother tried to kill you, that she didn't even want you in the first place! By the time I was born...she was addicted. I want to tie her to a post and burn her alive, or crush her under rocks until...well, you know, but I can't. One, I'd go to jail and two she's re married with another daughter and I couldn't deal with that on my conscience, that a child is going through life without a mother because of me. But, on the upside, I still get to see my fun, eccentric grandmother Maggie. She's taken me on an Alaskan cruise, Houghton Lake, Dayton Ohio to see Lion King on Broadway, and when I graduate, she's taking me to Boston, Salem and The Lizzie Bordon house. My mom tells me to be cautious...because she might want to try and get me and Dee back together. I have been wary, I mean, she has talked about Dee and Katie around me, Katie is the girl's name. I told Gramma and I made it very clear that I'm fine with seeing Katie, but, not Dee. And she said, \"You can't have one and not the other right now.\" And so far, she has respected my wishes, but my adopted mom, that's a different story. We get into these heated debates about my birth family and how I don't know this and I don't know that and yadda yadda yadda. But I know she's looking out for me a my interests though she seems like she just doesn't care about what I want in life. And a lot of times, she's just plain rude to me, she'll comment on my weight when I ask to go on the computer or when I'm reading, writing, watching TV, playing on the Wii, drawing, and just minding my own business and I'll hear, \"Can you do anything useful?\" I can't tell you how much that stings, when your doing something that someone prided you for and they ask you that,I feel like I'm being stabbed in the back! Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a very easy person to get along with. I'm naturally bubbly and giggly and I like Blue Collar Comedy jokes and I love to tell them to make people smile, laugh, and make someone's day. Trust me, spend an hour with me...you will not be bored. Though with my quirks, it comes with a price, I'm dangerously single, I don't have any close friends, I mean, the last time I was invited to go shopping, I came back looking like a slut. Hardly any phone calls to invite me to hang out, I went to prom and my date told me that he liked me and I really liked him already. I told him that and we've seldom spoken since and I still have the same feelings now. Even at 18 I still run to Carol for help, I've been to a lot of therapists asking me about Carol and telling me to let him go...I pretend to have let him go, but when no one's around, I talk to him. And on those days at night, I step onto the island and see him in person and I see he's not the only one on the island, there's a white rooster who is the peacekeeper and very kind and wise, this is Douglas, there's a goat who's around my height his name is Alexander and if he were human, he could easily be my age and he basically wants attention and I'm the only one there who acknowledges him. And I actually feel nervous around him. In a good way not a bad way. Then there's Ira, he's got an aura of bad posture, grey fur, and a huge Pinnochio long nose that's a little distracting. There's also Daniel who's' literally a giant bull with human feet, he doesn't say much but there's a sort of silent communication between us. Then there's the girls, first there's Judith...Ira's wife who's' brutally honest and sometimes harsh. And finally my favorite out of the two, KW...she's the sweetest one out of all of them, she's gentle and open hearted and sees the best in everyone. KW is Carol's wife and I can easily see why he fell for her. I talk to them, play with them, sing to them, ask for advice-all in one dream and before I have to wake up they send me back in the boat. I hug them all goodbye, Carol kisses my head and places me in the boat and says softly, \"I'll eat you up I love you so.\" Then off I would go, happy tears filling my face as they disappeared in the distance and I would wake up. I've always been curious if this place ever existed because this has been my childhood. And when I leave in the boat, looking back at their faces, there is only love and affection in their expressions. The strongest is Carol's, I can tell he cares about what I have to say, he wouldn't do or say anything to purposely harm me and my feelings reflect his. I want to come so bad, but, that's the problem with dreams...in your dreams you know instinctively what to do, and where to go. But in the real world, you can't remember, no matter how hard you try.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 I Give Up! I woke up that morning and went downstairs, Saturday ugh, I hate weekends. Because I have to put up with chores chores chores and more chores. While my sister rks on next month's homework and Will hogs the phone talking to his girlfriend. I sat on the sofa and put on Animal Planet and watched Must Love Cats...I was tired and bored and no one else was up yet. Then my dad, John was up, he fed our 5 cats then sat in the recliner. As everyone else got up, the more I stayed silent, if I said one word, they'd ignore me and I'd end up hurt. Mom had me walk our dog Oreo around the backyard then I did dishes, folded laundry, sorted laundry, folded laundry again, scrubbed the bathroom, walked Oreo again, had lunch, did the dishes, took scraps out to the garden...ten times, set the table for dinner, had dinner, did the dinner dishes, got my shower and went to bed. And during the course of that day I got a total of a half hour of me time. When that happened, my mom would say, \"Get up off your lazy ass and do something!\" But that night, I overheard something that quickly made me make up my mind to leave. I was in my room, reading East By Edith Pattou when I needed to go to the bathroom and I heard my parents talking. \"We could send her to a home,\" my mom said. \"You mean like an independant living home?\" Dad asked, agreeingly. \"Yeah, I mean, she doesn't have an income, her grades are down the toilet, I have to ask her to do work, I have to waste my gas for her appointments because she refuses to learn to drive the tractor for us to pay for her driver's ed, and she's not paying for her room and board. Oh, and let's not forget how she's living in a fantasy world and all she wants to do is sit. She's a huge dissapointment and burden on us all and you know it.\" Burden? Disappointment? Choking back tears, I strode upstairs to my room, acting like I didn't hear a thing. After my door was closed, I collapsed on the bed and wept into my pillow and clutching my stuffed panda, Pandi. The cry I made was the kind where every sob hurt to let out and hurt to keep closed inside, the kind where every breath felt like it was going to tear you to shreads, the kind where you feel like your the only person in this land of misery. After I was sure that everyone was asleep, I made up my mind...leave. Leave this world where nobody appreciated me or my talents, hated me for being myself, wanted to change me into the complete opposite of me, where being a few pounds overweight is such a crime, where I'm not free to be me, I'm in a tug of war between two families and where I'm a dissapointment and burden to my own family. 'Well, I won't be a burden to them financially anymore,' I thought to myself. I got my schoolbag, dumped out the crinkled, old, and finished worksheets, bindersand other school related materials and placed in some changes of clothing, my bear throw blanket, a couple of my favorite books, and Panel inside. Then, I got my Aeropostale bag and put in my journals, my MP3 player, my Wolf Suit I made in sewing class and my knit version of Carol that I made. Then I put on my brown parka with fur lined around the hood, my sneakers, and my bags and left for good. I was giving this life up and I wasn't coming back. Anywhere is better than here.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 The Wild Things I ran down the street with tears in my eyes, I felt betrayed, un loved and of course un wanted. I ran until I was at the lake and I saw a boat, an average sized one and a bone white. I recognized it from my dreams, I took it as a sign and stepped in and pushed away from the shore. A night went by...then days, weeks, months, years ! I don't know! One day, I finally saw land, I was starving and I knew that where there was land...there'd be food! I had to go through rapids to get to land but both me and the boat made it in one piece. Once ashore, I felt dizzy and light headed. My face felt hot and my body felt hot even though it was freeze your butt off cold. I tried to walk and it was more like stumbling. When I got into the forest, I fell multiple times...I could feel blood flowing onto my pant legs from the cuts I got when I fell. And when I'd been trekking for what felt like hours...my legs finally gave out. I tried to call for help, but my voice didn't go above a whisper, my throat felt like it was clawed out. All I heard was a THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP on the ground as I cried, I looked up and saw a dark shadow over me before I passed out. I felt myself being picked up and carried through the woods. A few minutes later, I heard an overlapping conversation take place. \"What is that?\" a cranky female voice asked. \"Get KW, Now!\" the one who was carrying me demanded. He had a sort of Jersey accent to him. I felt him laying me down, my head lolled from side to side. A few heartbeats went by and I heard someone come in. \"Carol?\" a sweet warm female voice asked. \"I found her in the woods.\" \"She's white as death!\" She gasped. \"What is it?\" a male teenager voice asked. \"I think it's a her ,\" a dopey sounding male voice responded. \"Whatever it is, she's in rough shape,\" the Jersey accented one said as he dabbed my forehead with something cold and wet. My eyes opened a little, it took a minute for my eyes to adjust and when they did, I thought I was having an out of body experience. I saw 7 hairy monsters all around me, they all looked concerned for me. \"Here,\" the cranky voiced one said as she handed the kind voiced one a wooden cup. \"Here honey...don't worry, it's water.\" She put the cup to my lips and I drank the clean, unsalted water. \"What's your name?\" the jersey accented one asked. I had to try hard to find my voice, but it was still raw and sore. \"Em-mily...\" I croaked. The jersey accented one's eyes widened as the kind voiced one's claws ran through my short hair soothingly. \"Is there anything we can do to help you?\" I had to find my voice again to say, \"So...so...tired.\" \"Ssh...alright-go to sleep.\" She turned to everyone else and said, \"We have to keep her warm.\" \"How?\" the cranky one asked. \"We can pie on top of her,\" a southern gentleman voice suggested. I then felt them piling over me, being careful not to crush me. I was in la la land right before they were, I could never remember a day where I loved being sick.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 A Day With Carol I have no clue how long I slept, but when I suddenly became aware of the voices talking around me. \"Why are you attached to her Carol?\" the cranky one asked. \"I told you Judith, I've known her since she was a kid!\" My eyes fluttered a little, Carol? Judith? \" Why do you care?\" \"Hurt her, I'll hurt you.\" Judith left and Carol knelt by side and another figure came to his side. \"How long has she been out?\" the female with the sweet voice asked. \"3 days.\" 3 days ?! \"Wow, what do you think she's like.\" \"I know what she's like, she's smart, funny, creative and adventurous. Trust me, you'll love her KW.\" KW? I suddenly found my voice, \"Car-ol...K...W..\" They turned to me instantly, \"Em? Emily? Can you say something else?\" Carol asked. My eyes fluttered open, and I saw them...just like in my dreams. I smiled, \"Hi.\" They both laughed in relief, \"Hey,\" Carol said. \"How are you?\" KW asked. \"I'm OK.\" KW laughed softly and said, \"So you're Emily...Carol's told us so much about you.\" \"Really?\" I said looking at him. He looked down; if he were human, he'd be blushing. My next question was to make sure they weren't joking earlier, \"How long was I asleep?\" Carol sighed, \"3 days, and you really had us worried there for a minute.\" \"Seriously?!\" I sat up too quickly and my head spun. \"Whoa...\" I groaned. \"Easy, easy,\" Carol said calmly. Then Judith came in and commented, \"Oh, good, she's up! for a while I thought we'd be dragging your body to an unmarked grave.\" Carol shot her a look and she gave him a testy look back and left. Carol and KW then supported me as I stood up. And soon after, I was walking. I felt like a newborn foal, about 5-10 minutes after birth...they're walking, running and jumping. Carol offered to take me out for a special day...an offer I accepted. I walked by him through the forest in awe of the colors in the trees. They were shades of green, brown, burgundy, yellow and orange. Here, it was still autumn with soft baby pink and baby blue flower petals brushing my face in the wind. I looked up as I walked beside him, but I finally had to stop. I couldn't help it, I reached up and spun around slowly. I was catching leaves and petals as I did this. I was in a trance when he snapped me out of it. \"Having fun?\" \"Yeah-sorry...I just-I only saw this place in my dreams and could never touch it.\" \"Don't worry, I get it - come on, I wanna show you something.\" He then let me ride on his shoulders; it reminded me of being a little girl riding on my dad's shoulders with a fudge popsicle at a car show in summer. Carol secured my legs and I clamped into the fur on the back of his head. I felt their fur before when they piled over me to keep me warm. It's soft, a bit wiry, but plush at the same time. \"So did you sail here?\" he asked. \"Yeah, but unlike in my dreams, I had to do it by guesswork.\" \"Wow! You learn fast!\" \"It depends on the subject.\" I took in the scenery, at Carol's height and everything was richer, clearer and more luminescent. \"Do you always see like this?\" I asked. \"Being me has it's perks.\" \"Like not feeling cold?\" \"Or pain...well up to a point.\" I laughed. \"Do you know any jokes?\" he asked. \"How many cockroaches does it take to make the sun come up?\" He paused to think of an answer, \"I don't know - how many?\" \"Can't tell, when the sun goes down, they scatter!\" Carol boomed a laugh that made me vibrate. \"That's a good one! I'll remember that one!\" There was a silence then he asked, \"Why'd you come here?\" \"Well, you know how it is with my family - they're trying to change me.\" He scoffed in disbelief and I continued, \"I heard them talking about sending me to a special home.\" \" What kind of home?\" \"It's for people who can't fend for themselves, whose parents just quit on them and whose brains don't function right - people like me .\" He paused to think of how to respond; then said, \"I'm sorry that happened to you Em.\" I twisted a smile - he sounded like he really meant it. We then were walking in a desert that looked as if it shouldn't be there. Carol let me down and walk beside him. When we went uphill on the dunes my foot sank into the sand. And when that happened, he took my hand and helped me up. We arrived at a series of cliffs and he helped me to climb them. Once we were at the top, he let me take a breather before continuing on. \"Ready?\" he asked after 5 minutes. I nodded, got up and followed him. He led me to a room with a visibly repaired table that had an assembly of mountains, canals and carvings of the rest of the group. It reminded me of Venice Italy, everyone there travels on gondolas on rivers. \"You made this?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\" said with a prideful, blushing voice. \" I can't even do this...this is amazing.\" \"Thanks - hey, wanna see a street view?\" \"Sure.\" He pointed to a hole in the side, \"Crawl in here.\" I pointed to the hole, \"Here?\" He nodded, \"Right here.\" I crawled in and stuck my head through a hole and I was at street level. Everything was higher and I felt like I'd been shrunk down. \"Now watch this.\" He tilted a jug and water filled the streets; a small boat glided by with carvings of Carol and KW in it. \"You're incredible, I think you really have a gift.\" I crawled out and he was looking at me solemnly. \"Em, I have to tell you something...something very important, okay?\" \"Okay.\" He took my hand and led me to the entrance and we sat on the top step. He looked at me with sincere honesty. \"Em, I've known you your whole life and once you came here, KW took a motherly role over you. And me...I...ugh, how do I say this?\" \"Just say it Carol.\" \"I've taken the fatherly role over you. Look, I know what they were going to do to you. They were going to send you somewhere so they wouldn't have to deal with you anymore. I would never ever ever ever do that to you; you know that. I'll never send you off like that or even think of it.\" I smiled at him and he soothingly scratched the back of my head. I was feeling drowsy again as we watched the sky turn pink - sunset. The last thing I remember was laying against Carol's fur before everything went dark.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Rumpus The next morning, I woke up to find that I slept between Carol and KW last night. Now that their true feelings were out there, I loved it here. I felt them breathing as I lay there and it made me fall asleep again. When I awoke again a couple hours later, it was from the feeling of Carol and KW wanting to get up. I could've slept a little more, but I didn't want to miss what we'd be doing that day. Douglas had the perfect idea, he told me to yell a certain phrase as loud as I could. \"Really?\" I asked him a little confused. \"Yeah.\" \"What'll happen after?\" \"Just trust me, it'll be great!\" Carol approached us then and said cautiously, \"Douglas, I don't think that's such a good idea.\" \"Why not? She's fast, right?\" \"Yeah, I was captain of the track team! Douglas, I can't even run without finding something to trip on.\" Carol laughed at my sarcasm because he knew it was true. I was then looking into the eyes of 7 excited monsters, so I yelled at the top of my lungs, \"LET THE WILD RUMPUS START!\" They were then hooting and howling and then began running to the shore. I tried to run after them but I wasn't fast or coordinated enough. I tripped 3 times before I got completely lost. I ran in a daze, calling everyone's name; hoping someone would hear me. I then stopped; now I was inwardly freaking out. Then I heard someone say beside me, \"Need some help there?\" I looked and it was Alexander. \"How did you find me?\" I asked. \"When you didn't show up at the beach, we got worried.\" He then turned around offering for me to ride piggyback. I got on and he rand me in the right direction. He ran as fast as a chipmunk and had better coordination than me ! We came to the shore and he let me down. I ran up with them and we began howling, I felt like a kid again at that moment. After that, we went back into the forest and began uprooting trees, batting each other with them, jumping around, jumping or diving off of trees and I watched them either laughing, worried or both. Judith approached me and said, \"Whoa! What'd you do to your face?\" I put my hand on the side of my face to see what it was. \"No, let me see...whoa what's that? No, don't worry, let me see..\" She then licked the entire side of my face! \"Ew! Gross!\" I exclaimed wiping the saliva off of my face. \"I'll have to remember not to fall for that one!\" After a while, Alexander approached me shyly and said nervously, \"Carol mentioned you were pretty, but he didn't say you were this pretty...\" He then caught himself, \"No! He didn't say you were ugly or anything it's just...you're different - I mean that in a good way! Not a bad different a - a good different, the kind where you're - I'm gonna shut up now.\" I laughed at his attempts to compliment me, I thought he was sweet and funny and he was like an older brother to me...I think. After a few hours of rumpusing and fun and whatnot, one by one we all got tired and they all piled over me again with Carol and KW at the bottom. But as we drifted, I (for some odd reason) began singing 'A Song for Mia' by Lizz Wright. It went: I went down to the water , all night long I'm putting my feet in ,all night long And I went down to the water , all night long And I'm putting my dreams in , all night long And what you think of me ,I can't say I'll take these bad dreams and I'll drove along the way I'm at the shore now , the shadows at my back I can feel the waves coming there , heavy and black But I can't turn away now 'cause I They're singin' a song And I , I'm in harmony I'm singing along And what you did to me I , I can't take no more I'll take these bad dreams and I'll lay them at the shore The end of the ocean I'll never see I stare out in the distance and it's looking back at me And I'll look down to the water all night long And I'll put my feet in , all night long And I'll put my dreams in , all night long And I'll put my tears in , all night long I went down to the water Then there was the sound of 7 snores and they put me to sleep like a lullaby; comfortably warm, I smiled in my sleep.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Houses Within a week, I had almost everyone (i.e. Judith) wrapped around my finger. Carol and KW were on my side from the beginning, Alexander looks at me like a fat guy looks at tacos, Ira was like that funny uncle you can't wait to see at Christmas, Douglas reminded me of Carlisle from Twilight and I respected him, Daniel was mostly silent but he always brought me a flower and tucked it behind my ear and Judith...well...we don't exactly see eye to eye. I mean, I tried to be nice to her but I usually left crying. One day, I concocted a plan with Carol, after I saw the remains of their former village...I could help them rebuild new houses like the ones they had and they could be built near the fort. Carol was already on board, \"You're a good thinker Em...even better than me! And I don't say that to everyone!\" he said. When I told everyone else, they agreed. Although, Judith was silent for some odd reason. But, immediately, we got to work. The fort would be more of a hangout area and the houses for when we want to be alone and sleeping. Total, we would create 6 houses, 3 on one side of the fort and 3 on the other side. I would assist with 5 and Carol and KW would work on ours and Douglas would teach me how to build them correctly and that I stayed hydrated and fed throughout the work hours. And at night I sang a song for them, I sang through 5 nights: Deep In the Meadow by Sting The Riddle by Five For Fighting No One by Alicia Keys Safe and Sound by Taylor Swift Gaelic Lullaby by Judy Collins It took 6 days to make 6 houses, the one Carol and KW created was big enough for the 3 of us. Our celebration of the completion of our houses was a bonfire and listening to my singing. I could tell that Judith was miffed by this because Carol complimented in front of her that he loved my singing voice and she gave me death stares. I knew that she wasn't making my life here any easier, but I decided to keep my head held high no matter what she said. I mainly just avoided her and she did the same with me. I loved it here, the freedom from my cage and the love that surrounded me. Everyone (except Judith) made me feel wanted and heard and I made sure I heard their opinions as well in return. Carol even added a new carving to his model city - me. He brought me there to show it to me blindfolded. His craftsmanship has never ceased to amaze me. And also during my time here, my hair grew longer. My hair started out at jaw length and grew to my shoulder blades; KW took advantage of this by braiding it every morning. She liked my hair long and even wove Daniel's flowers into the braids. I never wanted to go back to the home where I was nothing, unappreciated, and unheard.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: A Day With KW One morning, I had a nightmare about my family. I was sitting on the beach, the waves soaking my hands and legs; then I feel someone watching me. I turn around and see them; their eyes are a pearly, milky white and they say in unison, \"Why did you leave us?\" \"Because you were going to send me away anyway...I had to leave.\" \"You selfish, selfish girl!\" \"Reason #2 why I left! You always have to find a reason to insult me!\" \"Selfish! Selfish! Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish girl!\" I jolted awake like a current of electricity went through me. It woke up both Carol and KW, \"Em, you okay?\" Carol asked. \"Nightmare...I'm fine.\" \"Em, you're crying,\" KW stated. I just then noticed that my eyes were moist, KW then dried them off. It was still in the middle of the night so she sang a Scottish song I taught her...it was the lullaby from Brave. I taught it to her and after going over it twice, she sang it perfectly, it went: A naoidhean bhig, cluinn mo ghuth Mise ri d' thaobh, O mhaighdean bhàn Ar rìbhinn òg, fàs a's faic Do thìr, dìleas féin A ghrian a's a ghealach, stiùir sinn Gu uair ar cliù 's ar glòir Naoidhean bhig, ar rìbhinn òg Maighdean uasal bhàn She sang it until I was asleep again and my sleep this time was dreamless. That day, KW took me out for a special day since the houses were finished. She took me to her beach where she introduced me to 2 owls named Bob and Terry. After an hour of me asking them questions and KW translating the answers we began walking along the shore talking; while I snacked on an apple I picked on our way over. \"What was your dream about last night?\" she asked as I bit into the apple. I didn't want to answer that one because I didn't want to offend her. \"I can't answer that,\" I responded after I swallowed. She didn't press me; instead, she asked, \"Are you planning on going back?\" \"Definitely not.\" \"Why?\" \"They - didn't want me in their lives anymore so...I gave them what they wanted.\" She nodded, \"You like it here?\" \"I love it here.\" \"Good.\" She pulled me into her side and kissed the top of my head. We walked and talked toward the shore by the fort; she asked about what I liked to do, what I didn't like to do, my childhood, pets things I loved and things I hated. I asked her the same questions after I answered them; she liked to have fun, she didn't like to be bossed around, she loves beaches and hates lizards. She remembered nothing of her childhood, and for pets she has Bob and Terry. She was very kind, easy to make laugh, and funny and has a sort of motherly touch to her. Her and Carol are the most likeable of the group next to Ira, Douglas, Daniel and Alexander ( not in that order!) We reached the shore by the fort when I felt a drop on my nose. The drop was warm, I looked up and around; Bob and Terry were on a nearby dune, so it wasn't owl feces, thank God. \"The warm rain is coming in,\" KW observed. \"I've never been in a warm rain.\" \"Wanna see what I like to do?\" \"Sure.\" She turned away from me and offered me her back, I linked my arms around her neck and let my legs hang. She adjusted me so I wouldn't choke her and wait for the rain to come down harder. The rain felt like a warm shower with fat droplets splashing onto my skin and clothing. I was bare footed and wearing a white tank top and a baby blue A-line skirt that went to my knees. \"Ready?\" she asked. 'Yeah,\" I said excitedly. She then spread her arms open and began to spin around. My legs flung out as she went faster and I squealed like I was on a roller coaster. This was better than the swings at the fair. The ones that spin you around while your in a seat. My squeals gained us an audience, Carol and the rest of the group ran over the dune in hysteria. They probably thought one of us was hurt; but when they saw us laughing in our dervish spin they were relieved. KW stopped and let me down as Carol approached us. I was soaked to the skin and my hair clung to my head. My skirt was sopped and plastered to my body, I used it to catch the rainwater and toss it on my face. \"What's going on here?\" Carol laughed. I caught some more and splashed it on Carol, then I bolted as he playfully ran after me, \"C'mere you!\" He picked me up from behind and threw me in the ocean. I resurfaced and stood up in the knee deep water and splashed him, he splashed me back and splashed KW. Alexander came up and I kicked some water at him and he did the same back. Then I jumped backwards into the ocean and resurfaced by sitting up. Douglas and Ira joined in while Daniel and Judith hung back. Daniel wasn't into this kind of stuff so I understood - I just could never get Judith. Too drunk with the water to care I continued to sing and dance in the rain. I sang until I grew hoarse and my body tired out and sat on a dune, hugging my knees and watching the sunset.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: The Dirt Clod Fight Two days later, everyone was bored, so Carol got up and said, \"Hey! Who's up for a dirt clod fight?\" I looked at him stupidly as everyone looked like they were silently said, ' Oh boy.' \"A what?\" I asked. \"A dirt clod fight - we basically pummel each other with dirt clods.\" KW then spoke, \"Carol, I don't think that's a good idea - she's smaller than us.\" I felt the cage coming again, so I said, \"I can handle it - besides, I'm bored and it's nice out.\" \"See? She's up for it!\" KW and the others only had wariness on their faces. I saw it as being as harmless as paintball, which I never tried so that's why I was up for it. I selected my other teammates - Carol and KW of course. Carol insisted on Douglas - so I picked him, though originally I was going to pick Alexander. Then we began. Carol struck the first blow and I tried to throw another blow but I ended up hitting the ground while Carol's hit Ira's shoulder. 'Curse my terrible aim!' I thought. Then we hid in a bunker fashioned out of a fallen log and a small plateau. Douglas barreled a clod at Judith while the other team's ammunition was exploding on the log. I could see why Carol insisted on Douglas - he's got an arm like iron ! \"Good arm!\" I told him. \"Thanks.\" We were trapped, we were volleying dirt over to the other side and they were volleying back. I then had an idea, I would go out as a distraction and they would try to hit me and the other 3 would be free to fire at them. I explained my idea to them and they looked at me like I had a 3 headed Chihuahua on my head. \"Are you insane?!\" Douglas exclaimed. \"If I can just distract them for a while then - \" \"Em...be realistic here!\" Carol said through his teeth. \"I am !\" Still, no one was on board. \"Look - it's the only chance we've got !\" I tried to reason. With a wary and thoughtful look, Carol nodded, \"Be safe.\" \"I'll try.\" Bent over, I walked to the end and nodded back to them to get into their position, they did and I jumped out waving my arms, \"Hey! Over here!\" It caught their attention and I ran and dirt and rocks came from the bunker I left. I heard yells coming from the other side. I kept running; I turned and saw Judith running after me. \"That wasn't fair Em!\" She yelled as a dirt clod missed my head by a hair, another one hit a tree trunk by my arm and I moved as fast as I could without stumbling. Then, I felt something hard hit my left side and I was on the ground. I wasn't screaming but the pain was excruciating. I can't even begin to explain it, but I knew some things were broken. \"Ha! Gotcha!\" Judith said victoriously. I wanted to pound her face in, but I couldn't move. \"Em?\" A cry finally came out and she went into panic mode. \"Oh my God! Oh God! CAROL! Get over here! Help! Emily's hurt!\" The world outside my pain was absent, I felt someone pick me up and carry me to the fort where Carol, KW, Daniel, Judith and IRA waited outside while Douglas got to work on re breaking the bones on my lower ribcage. Alexander was there to hold my hand through this whole ordeal. After I was bandaged, I was allowed to rest before being moved to the hut. The healing process took 2 months and neither Carol or KW left my side for a minute.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Truths After the bandages were off, Judith didn't apologize - two weeks after - still nothing. In fact for 2 weeks straight she didn't speak...period. When 3 weeks went by and she still wasn't speaking, we all started to get worried. Ira even came up to me and asked me to talk to her. \"She's just not...her. You know? I know she feels horrible about your ribs - please just talk to her.\" Feeling worried for her as well, I agreed to do it. I found her at the beach outside the fort grounds sitting on a dune. I slowly approached her from behind. \"Judith?\" \"If you're coming for an apology, you're not gonna get it.\" Impatient, I tried to start again, \"Alright Judith, I don't know what I did to make you hate me so much-\" \"Hate?\" She turned to face me and continued, \"I don't hate you, I don't particularly like you, but I don't hate you. Em, I was trying to drive you away from here to protect you from Carol.\" \"Why? I've known him my whole life.\" \"You only know one side of him.\" \"What do you mean?\" She patted the sand next to her, \"You might want to sit down.\" I sat next to her warily, and she began, \"It all started with Max, he said he was a king with magical powers and we bought it. Carol took him under his wing; as did KW and when Carol found out he was a fake king he went ballistic! It was thanks to KW that he escaped. When Carol began having dreams about you, I knew it was going to be Max all over again. He'll never let you leave or let you out of his sight.\" \"I wasn't planning on leaving anyway-\" \"Em, you're a replacement - can't you see?\" That made me boil , I knew she was right...I felt used . \"I have to go.\" I got up and walked back to the fort grounds. I angrily stormed up to Carol, \"Why did you care about me?\" He looked at me confused, \"What?\" \"Is it true about Max?\" Judith came up from the shore, Carol looked at her as his eyes widened, \"You told her about Max?\" \"She deserved to know.\" \"What is wrong with you?!\" \"Carol, is it true?\" I interrogated. \"Yes, but it's not like that-\" \"Why should I believe you? You lied to me! I'm just another Max to you aren't I?\" He lightly took my forearm, \"Em-\" I harshly wrestled out of his grip, \"\"Don't touch me Carol!\" I pushed him away from me and his face was visibly stung as I yelled, \"Don't...touch me!\" He made no movement towards me; the others were frozen where they were in shock. I then stormed off to the woods. \"Em-\"Carol began to call and follow after me, but KW stopped him. \"Carol, I think she needs to be alone right now.\" Carol didn't argue with her as I entered the forest and walked until I reached the shore where I first arrived. The boat was still in the same place where I left it. I then felt the urge to cry, I dropped to my knees and cried a chest shaking sob that made me go on my side and turn the sand into mud. I felt lost, confused, scared and I was barely holding it together. I actually had half a mind to go home, but I got up and started walking again.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Cliffs I walked until I reached the cliffs and the wind caught my hair. The wide expanse of the ocean glittered in pre sunset. I remembered the freezing temperature of the water, but it didn't stop my clouded thoughts. \"Emily!\" I heard Carol call. I took off my slip on shoes, if no one wanted me for me...why am I here? \"Emily!\" KW called frantically. I took a step forward, then ran and flung myself off of the cliffs. \"EMILY!\" I heard KW scream. I screamed out of adrenaline, as a final goodbye to the world. Then, the current caught me; it twirled me, flipped me and tossed me. I didn't know which way was up or down, left or right, and forward or backwards. Then I was thrust against into the rocks. I lost consciousness and felt the water flood down my throat; it was a choking, burning feeling and I welcomed it. I was leaving this life; I felt myself sinking as my body went limp. Then, I knew I was dead, my head resurfaced. I knew I was floating to heaven, but I didn't float any further. Maybe I would become a part of the sea? Like Neptune...or a mermaid maybe - at least I'd be beautiful. I tried to open my eyes but couldn't - that was when I felt fur. \"She's unconscious! But I think she's still alive!\" I knew that voice - Carol? Someone grabbed my ankles as Carol wrapped his arms around my chest. I was carried a few yards and laid on the sand as I heard a scream of mourn, terror and shock. Not KW's - Judith's. I then felt a rock slamming my chest repeatedly, the water was gushing up in rhythm. The salt burned my throat and nose, someone was trying to save me. \"C'mon Em!\" Carol said through gritted teeth. I didn't know if it was him pounding my chest but I couldn't live; I didn't want to live. I had no purpose in this life whatsoever, if I did - what is it and why am I alive? I'm better off dead at this point. \"Em? Hun...can you hear me?\" Carol asked. With 3 more thrusts, I coughed up all the water in my lungs; with a series of coughs my eyes opened. I saw Alexander at my side, Carol over me, Douglas comforting KW, Ira doing the same with Judith, and Daniel holding his head in his hands in relief. \"Em? Hun, can you speak?\" Carol asked. \"I...didn't. Wanna. Be. Saved.\" I croaked. \"I didn't have time to ask permission - sorry,\" Carol said tearfully. He combed his claws trough my bangs, \"What would we have done if anything happened to you?\" \"What. You were. Doin'...before me.\" \"You make that sound easy,\" Alexander laughed. I lifted the corner of my mouth in a grin. I was surrounded by this love - Judith was wrong...I should've known better than to listen to her. I felt sobs like before come up; Carol then sat me up and pulled me into a bear hug. This is when I cried harder, \"I'm so sorry ! I didn't mean what I said!\" He then rocked me from side to side like a small child, \"Ssh, it's okay - I'm here.\" I was shivering violently from the cold, and he kept me warm and realized how judgmental I was. But, if this was the life I was going to choose...what about my former family? This was the last question in my mind before Carol picked me up, KW took my hand and we went home.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11: Contemplation I hardly slept that night with these thoughts in my head. Should I go home? Should I stay? What would happen if I did this? What would happen if I did that? Would I turn into one of them if I stayed? And what about my family? I know they treated me like total garbage, but...isn't there a saying that you can't pick your family? This isn't my situation - I have to pick a family. I have to choose between: the family that raised me or the family that made me feel wanted. Then I came up with a plan, I would check on them and if they're the same as always - I would come back and stay for good. I just don't know how Carol's going to react to it. I remembered what Judith said when found out that Max was a fake king and shivered, he wouldn't do that to me ! Would he? What if he did? If Carol turned on me - there'd be no stopping him! He...will... kill me! Carol will be the last one to tell at this point, I'll start with Daniel, then Douglas, Ira Judith, Alexander, KW, then Carol so at least I'll have protection if Carol goes nuts. I imagined their hurt but understanding faces and felt tears swell up. I let them glide down both sides of my face - this is the emotional journey; I already went through the physical journey. Now my problem was how to tell them; I had to do it gently. It would be like breaking up with someone and telling him that we should see other people. I had to be gentle, but firm - not harsh, firm. The next morning, after everyone was awake, I pulled Daniel aside and told him. At first he was confused and sad, but was fully understanding that I had to be sure that I was going to be treated differently. \"If it's the same, I'll come back...if it's different, I'll still come back and visit.\" Daniel then tucked a daffodil behind my ear and pulled me into a bear hug. I then told Douglas with the same result, then Ira. I told them if they could spread the news amongst the group, it would make it easier for me.[Chapter 12] Chapter 13: Alexander's Confession It was the day before my departure that I decided to spend some time with Alexander. we were going through the forests, silently, when I remarked awkwardly, \"It's so pretty here, I'm gonna miss this scenery.\" He didn't respond for a few footfalls, \"Are you gonna...miss us ?\" I stopped and turned to him, \"Of course! I'll definitely miss all of you.\" He smiled awkwardly, looked around and said, \"I've been wanting to say something for a while now...I imagined a different setting but - it'll have to do, I'm running out of time.\" I looked at him confusedly, \"What are you talking about?\" \"I may not have known you personally but I knew you through Carol's stories and you've seen... me right?\" \"Yeah, why?\" He took a deep breath, \"Here it goes...Emily...I am in love with you Em. Emily, I love you. And I want you to stay, I don't you to leave. I know you have to, but-It would be like hanging from a cliff and waiting for someone to rescue you.\" I couldn't think of a response, no one has ever said any thing like that to me before. \"Em? Are you alright?\" \"Yeah...I'm fine.\" \"Are you sure? I mean did I say something-\" \"No, I mean...it's just-no one's ever said anything like that to me before.\" He smiled, \"But I'm not gonna be able to stop you am I?\" I shook my head. \"At least you know your options.\" \"I'll keep you in mind, when I have to decide.\" \"How long are you planning on waiting over there?\" \"A day.\" \"That's a year for us!\" \"Alex...\" \"I'm sorry, that was selfish.\" We then sat down and we napped for an hour with me in his arms.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13: Alexander's Confession It was the day before my departure that I decided to spend some time with Alexander. we were going through the forests, silently, when I remarked awkwardly, \"It's so pretty here, I'm gonna miss this scenery.\" He didn't respond for a few footfalls, \"Are you gonna...miss us ?\" I stopped and turned to him, \"Of course!

He looked angry, I've seen him happy, in pain, remorseful, and even prideful...but never angry and that face has been branded in the back of my mind. \"Carol, are you okay?\" I asked a little frightened. \"Who knows? Maybe I know, maybe I won't tell...like you didn't tell me you were leaving, are you really going?\" I nodded in hysteria, he found out. His face softened, \"Don't.\" \"I have to.\" \"Why? Why are you going back to them ?! the ones who treated you like...like...this!\" He picked up a handful of dirt and let it slide through his fingers. \"Did I do something wrong? Is this about Max ?!\" I said nothing, I merely stepped backwards a few steps and Carol matched each stride. \"Answer me!\" he yelled. \"No! I just-\" \"Don't feel safe here, because of me, don't feel like hurting over me...what about all that about feeling wanted and loving it here, where did that go?\" \"Carol, you're scaring me!\" \"I'm scaring you? I'm scaring you?! Good! Then it'll make it more enjoyable when I prevent you from leaving for good!\" He's not saying what I think he's saying! \"I'll eat you up!\" Carol lunged and missed as I ran of into the woods screaming, \"Somebody help!\" I darted through a dense thicket, too small for Carol. I then had a head start when someone pulled me off the path, I looked up and there was Alexander. \"Listen, keep going, I'll go get help okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"Go!\" I bolted and he ran in the other direction. I ran until I felt like I could run no more, then I was bounced off of something like a trampoline, I landed on my back and saw KW. \"Come on,\" She said as she took my ankle and dragged me into the brush. I could hear Carol storming through the forest like an angry giant and I was now scared out of my mind when KW said, \"Here, get inside!\" I looked at her confused, \"What?\" \"Get in! Crawl inside my mouth, I'm gonna hide you!\" I looked at her like she was crazy, \"Again, what ?\" Carol was getting closer, I had no choice now. I put my foot in her mouth and stepped in. \"Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!\" She then pushed me further in and I was dropped in a sack of slimy fuzz, I realized the only air I was getting was from when she breathed, \"KW, do me a favor and breathe through your nose!\" \"Got it.\" Then Carol same through the thicket, \"EMILY!\" I overheard their conversation as I hyperventilated. \"Where is she?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Where is she?\" \"I don't know!\" \"I can smell her! Don't make me ask again!\" \"You leave her alone Carol!\" \"I wasn't really gonna eat her...I just...\" \"What?\" \"Overreacted!\" There was a slight pause, \"Am I really that scary?\" \"Carol, just go home.\" \"I just wanted a daughter.\" I was pained inside as I heard Carol leave. \"Are you alright in there hun?\" \"Well I'm being constricted and it doesn't exactly smell like a basket of roses in here.\" I felt and heard her snort a laugh, \"Here\" I was then pulled out and I fell asleep on her lap as she combed through my damp hair.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15: A Sad Parting I awoke to the sound of waves. I saw KW carrying me to the boat, she saw me waken and she put me down. And standing in a line was the rest of the group, with a look of desperation; everyone was there - except Carol. I started at the beginning of the row, with the bull, Daniel, and he spoke for the first time. \"Don't wait too long, please?\" \"I wont.\" I then said my tearful goodbyes to the others Alexander last of all, who let a golf ball sized tear drop on the top of my head. I then began to walk away when I turned and kissed the side of his face then we hugged and we parted. KW then lifted me into the boat and said, \"Don't go...I'll eat you up I love you so.\" She then hugged me and pushed me into open water. As the tide took me out, I saw a figure come out of the woods like a frantic maniac...it was Carol. His arms flailing, he was running toward the shore and a pained look came across his face when he saw that he was too late. In his face, I only saw sadness, no anger, just sorrow and regret. Then, almost as if he were in a trance he walked into the water, with no clue as to where he was. Then, once he realized I was too far he could do nothing but howl. I howled back in forgiveness, and this was all Carol wanted. He was overcome, his eyes a mess of tears, the others joined in and this too, made me tear up a little. Then I was headed towards the sunrise home. And they were gone. RIP JAMES GANDOLFINI 1961 - 2013[Chapter 16] Chapter 16: Where Home Is When I arrived home, it was about an hour after I'd left, midnight. I suspected that I'd been there a few months. But the next day, nothing changed for the better, I was still treated like a servant. It was the same thing, go do dishes, go do laundry, you'll never be successful at anything and all that other crap. And at dinnertime, I made an excuse to go walk up the road for exercise, telling them I wasn't hungry, but really, I was going back to the boat docks. And I knew...there was no turning back, I imagined all of my belongings and photos fading as I walked past the houses that made up the neighborhood where I grew up. I arrived at the docks and climbed in as the sun was setting and pushed away from the shoreline. I must have sailed for over a year back to my new home and I fell asleep as soon as I stepped in and curled into a ball on the floor and I slept the whole way back. And I dreamt, about anything and everything that happened in my life, from when I left the island to the day my birth mother first held me as a baby. It was like a video slideshow that was never ending, it went on and on until it started to slow down and I was coming awake. I felt myself on the beach as I heard my birth mother's heart beat and then, I felt the powdery sand under me. When I opened my eyes everyone was over me on the shore. I looked down to see claws and fur...I had a new life, as one of them...a wild thing. I sat up as I realized that I was accepted here, some say you have to leave home to find it and that's what happened to me. I was willing to give up everything to come here and start a new life...a life that accepted me, this is where I went for acceptance.

Where it was formerly a small town populated by people who seemed to know each other by their first names, it now held a large number of city folks who had relocated to the area. The old timers in the town believed that the increase in the town's population was brought about by the public knowledge that Supergirl had taken the residents under her protective wing. Something that everyone had seen happen to Metropolis when it became known that Superman was often seen in the area. The existence of the two super beings seemed to give the 2 places a higher sense of security and safety. The safety confidence of the public in Midvale was such that the small town saw its population double in size over the past 3 years. The economy of the town was also booming because of the new residents. Just like with any town that had a real estate boom, there was a high demand for excellent landscapers, and Ethan was one of the best in town. His business had now tripled and he found himself employing other landscapers under his company. He was a big boss now who still dressed in simple jeans and t-shirts. Gone was his old beat up Chevy pick up. He now had 5 Ford F-150 trucks registered to his company along with the 4 extra men who were now working for him. But being the boss never changed the way he did business. He still had a special roster of original clients whose horticulture needs he personally attended to. The Midvale School For Girls was still a regular client of his. The school held special meaning for him and he would tend to their gardens for free if they asked him to. One of the things that irritated him about the Midvale Boom, as the local newspapers called it, was that traffic went from non-existent to nightmarish almost overnight. As he sat in his air conditioned truck waiting for traffic to move so that he could ease his way onto 42nd street where his new office was located, he could not help but envy how his wife of 3 years never had to deal with traffic. All she had to do was fly. How he wished that he could do the same as Linda, in her alter ego form did. He looked anxiously at his watch, panic started to fill his eyes. He was going to be late getting home at this rate and she would definitely be furious with him if he showed up late today. He lowered his window and shouted at the ineffective traffic cop who stood in the middle of the road pretending to direct traffic. Traffic in Midvale streets usually flowed a lot smoother when the likes of him weren't trying to direct the vehicles on the road. \"C'mon buddy! Move the elephant!\" he hollered impatiently at the officer who glared at him. It took a good 10 minutes before he was able to get himself off the traffic ridden road and parked into the last available slot in his office compound. The other four trucks were already in for the day as well. He hurried into the office and picked up the only avaialable phone at the front desk. \"You're late. Why on earth did you choose today to work on the Bloom project.\" Vicki, the warm chestnut haired receptionist who was about the same age as Ethan warned him. \"I won't be late. I have time.\" he sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than the receptionist. A look of relief spread over his face as the answering machine at the house picked up the phone. \"Morrison residence. Tell us why you called and we will call you back when we can.\" said the giggling voice of Linda over the line. She wasn't home yet. He just might make it home before her. \"Linda, I got stuck in a monster traffic jam. No worries, I am on my way home. I won't be late.\" He replaced the reciever and hurried to his private office. He only had enough time to chuck his equipment into his locker before he raced out the door. Throwing the key to the front door at Vicki. \"Lock up after the others. I'll see you all at the house. \" he instructed her as he rushed out the door. **** The tall brunette woman was walking briskly out of the College of Arts and Sciences building of Midvale Community College. Having her classes finally end for the day did not make her feel any more confident that she would get home on time. She always seemed to have to make a few stops along the way that usually cost her valuable travel time, even though she could fly. Actually, flying was the main reason she often ran late getting home. \"Now remember Linda, go straight home. Mom is probably already there helping the caterers set up. Try not to stop for any reason. \" the hazelnut haired woman walking with her instructed as they headed for the school parking lot. \"I'll try Lucy. But, you know I cannot ignore anybody who needs my help.\" Linda explained as they reached Lucy's Peacock Blue Mitsubishi Lancer. \"Supergirl has to learn to chuck it once in a while my dear friend. You can't be late for your own event.\" she responded before getting into the car. \"I will go pick up the cake before heading to your place.\" \"Okay. And Jimmy will be there at what time?\" \"He took the day off from work today to make sure he would have enough time to set up at your house. He could be there by now.\" Linda closed the driver's door as Lucy started the engine. \"I'll see you there. In case Ethan gets home ahead of me, tell him we left at the same time and I should be there soon.\" She watched as her best friend drove off. \"I should ask Ethan to teach me how to drive one of these days. Lucy makes it look like so much fun and it seems that I am the only one on campus without a car. Not that I need one...\" she thought to herself before turning around and heading off to a deserted part of the campus where she could take flight without any notice. **** Kara was very happy that Kal-El had finally decided that he had trained her enough in the way of saving humans from the often dangerous and precarious situations that they always managed to get themselves into. There was a time during her training when she could only go on rescue missions with Kal-El, limiting her rescue immersion activities to Metropolis and, during the times when he was in Midvale as Clark Kent, a few non consequential rescues by Supergirl under the direct supervision of Superman. Midvale was more peaceful than Metropolis so during Kara's reconnaissance flights, she had time to just enjoy the flight and indulge in one of her favorite activities, the flying ballet. Usually her missions involved helping put out fires in the forest during the summer, or, once in a while, stopping a robbery in progress. The police department even gave her a plaque of appreciation a few years ago thanking her for her efforts in keeping Midvale residents always protected and safe. She was flying westward on her way home when the voices of children in trouble reached her ears. The conglomeration of voices seemed to be coming from the southern part of Midvale. The children were in a panic and crying as far as she could hear. Their collective voices reached her super senses. Causing Kara to lean into her flight. Going faster before it was too late. \"Help! Supergirl! We're going to fall!\" she heard the collective cries of children being carried through the air. The party would have to wait. Ethan would understand. He always did. He knew that just like Kal-El, she would sacrifice her personal happiness and safety for the good of those under her care. She saw the bus hanging dangerously on the edge of the bridge barrier. It would have fallen straight into the raging waters of the river below had the back tires not gotten caught on the wreckage of the steel barrier that the impact had destroyed. Using her x-ray vision, she surveyed the interior of the school bus. The police and rescue teams were already in place to save the kids but the position of the bus tied their hands. If they tried to open the back door of the bus, it would tilt even further and crash into the river for sure. There would not be enough time to get all of the children out of the bus safely before the inevitable happened. But that was the human way. Everyone applauded the sight of Supergirl appearing within the skies above the bus. The police got on their megaphones and asked the crowd to make way in case Supergirl needed the manouvering space. Her first instinct was to fly by the windows so the children inside would know that she was there. She noticed that whenever she or Kal-El were present at an incident, people involved calmed down a lot faster. The children who were crying began wiping away their tears and smiling at her with hope in their eyes. They knew she would save them. She smiled back and held her thumb up to let them know all would be well. Flying to the front of the bus which was hanging off the bridge, she took a strong hold on the stainless steel bumper before she hoisted the vehicle overhead and placed it safely on the pavement of the bridge. The children exited as fast as they could into the anxious arms of their parents. Kara checked on the bus driver whom she noticed did not move during her inspection. He was slumped over the steering wheel and had turned ashen in color. The paramedics came over and extricated him from the driver's seat. they tried to restart his heart on site but were unable to do so. They would take him to the hospital and try to revive him further there. \"It will take you 15 minutes to get to Midvale will be faster if I flew him in. His condition cannot wait.\" she told them as she slipped her arms under the fifty something man's body. **** They had moved into the new house on Arbor Street two years after they got married. Since the rent on their previous home was being raised, and Ethan's business was starting to pick up, it made more sense for them to put down a payment on their first home. It was the typical American family's home, complete with the white picket fence and step up porch. The color of the house was creamy yellow on the outside and off white on the inside. The roof tiles were basic blue with a few solar panels alongsidethe gutter to make the house energy efficient. Linda was very excited when they first moved in. It was a moderately sized compact house that easily housed the pair for they did not have own much in terms of material things. Just the bare neccessities as it were. The house had 4 bedrooms and two and a half baths. Too big for only two people but Ethan had insisted that he needed to have an office at home and Linda needed to have a seperate study room as well. He parked the Honda Accord in the driveway and made his way into the main house. The voice of Mrs. Lane instructing the rented staff boomed across the hall from the main door. \"Now make sure there is enough champagne in the chiller. We do not want to make a toast with warm , show him where to place the other boxes\" she instructed her husband who was trailing the delivery men who lugged in the cases of wine. He wanted to make sure they did not ruin the carpet that he had gifted Linda and Ethan with during their housewarming. \"Hi Mrs. Lane, Mr. Lane\" Ethan smiled at the woman who was like a mother to him. Time had aged her and her husband very gracefully. Aside from a few white hairs on both their heads, nobody would be able to tell that they had a successful journalist daugher and another one in her junior year in college. \"Ethan, Linda isn't home yet.\" he was told as he hung up his jacket in the hall closet. \"She probably had to make a few stops on the way home.\" he reasoned. \"And probably saved a few lives along the way.\" he silently thought. It took Ethan a good thirty minutes before he was finally ready to go downstairs and await the guests. He wondered what could be keeping Linda. \"Don't look at me. You know there is only one thing that could delay Linda.\" Lucy told him when he asked her why Linda wasn't home yet. He knew that they started off for home together everyday. The two steadfast friends always shared the same class schedules so that they always had their \"sister time\" on a daily basis. **** The man Kara had flown to the hospital was finally revived. The doctors said he had suffered a major heart attack while at the wheel of the bus. He was lucky that Supergirl had been there to fly him in otherwise, it would have been too late. He was admitted into the hospital for observation. Since everything seemed alright, Kara was about ready to leave and head home. She was already an hour late for the party. \"He wants to speak with you before you go.\" The female doctor in charge of the man told her when she mentioned she was leaving. The man, whose chart said his name was Alfred, had his eyes closed when Kara came in. He stirred only slightly and opened his eyes. He was attached to all sorts of monitoring devices that Kara was afraid to come near him for fear of accidentally disconnecting something. \"Thank you.\" he told her in a weake voice. \"I owe you my life.\" \"You don't owe me anything.\" Kara replied softly. \"Now close your eyes. Rest, and you will feel better tomorrow.\" \"Please Supergirl, stay with me till I fall asleep? Make sure that I will wake up? \" he requested her. How could she say no? \"His next of kin card says he has children. We already contacted them but they will have to drive down from Metropolis\" the nurse who was adjusting his IV drip informed her. Without even thinking about how Ethan would feel about her very delayed arrival, or if she would even make the party at all at this point, she pulled up a chair that was leaning against the wall near the door and sat down. \"I am not going anywhere. I will make sure that you wake up and that I am here with your children when you open your eyes. \" Supergirl had to kill time with his son and daughter for 2 of the 3 hours he slept before he finally opened his eyes. **** The party was well underway after seven p.m. and Linda was still nowhere to be found. What was keeping her? Ethan was visibly upset because her absence meant that he had to deal with all the guests alone. By seven p.m. he had had enough and pulled Clark aside to speak to. \"Can you go find Kara and bring her home? This is her party too and she is missing it. \" he asked. \"No need Ethan. I hear her already.\" Clark pointed upward and they saw Kara flying into the master's bedroom window which they always left open for her inconspicious arrivals. \"It's about time!\" Ethan declared before taking a big gulp of red wine. She came down to the party wearing a simple straight cut white dress. Mingling with the visitors who were composed of her classmates and his business associates, Ethan and Linda portrayed the image of a young couple very inlove with each other and starting out in life. What they did not see however, was that underneath the veneer of love, Ethan was slowly starting to resent his wife's dual identity. The secret identity that only a few people knew about. Who was loved by all but now irritating him. Normally, he did not mind having to share Linda with the rest of the nation whenever Supergirl was needed. But tonight was special for them. It was their 3rd wedding anniversary and the party was almost over when she arrived. Who could blame him for not even kissing her back when she greeted him after getting home? \"Ethan, you can smile better than that. It's your wedding anniversary\" Jimmy prodded him after the party was over and the immediate family, including the Lanes, posed for souvenier pictures. Jimmy, who had just begun hiring himself out as a party photographer to earn extra income, was their offical megman. \"Give him some loving Linda! Lucy teased while Clark and Lois smiled as they watched nearby. **** \"Why couldn't you have let the emergency services handle the situation?\" he asked her as they prepared to go to bed after the party. She was in the bathroom getting ready for bed and he was seated on the lazy boy as he flipped channels. \"They could not have done it without me Ethan. You know that there are some things only Kal-El and I can do. This was one of those things.\" her muffled voice came through the closed bathroom door. \"I know that Linda. But does it always have to be at my expense?\" he asked her as he finally settled on the basketball game on the tube. \"What are you talking about Ethan? You know you are number one with me.\" she opened the door and stuck her head out. \"I am number one with Linda. With Kara... I am not so sure.\" he sounded like a little boy throwing a tantrum. \"I am Linda. I am Kara. Regardless of what I am wearing and what color my hair is, I am still only one woman, the one you married. Your wife.\" she explained to him as she got into the sleeping outfit that she had bought earlier in the day. That was going to be her anniversary present to him. She came out of the bathroom and stood in front of the tv screen in her light blue silk robe. \"I'm watching the game.\" Ethan complained as he signaled her to step aside. \"You would rather watch the game than celebrate our anniversary?\" she asked him as she slowly undid the silk ribbon that held her robe closed. \"Party's over. I did not enjoy it.\" he complained trying to focus on the screen. \"So I take it you won't enjoy this?\" she dropped the robe in front of him to reveal a skimpy white negligee that covered very little of her body underneath. He swallowed hard at the sight of his wife clad skimpily infront of him. Linda was not usually one to make the first move. \"Nah.\" he pretended not to look at her. She took the remote control out of his hand and set is aside before floating only inches away from his lap. \"Then I guess you don't want your anniversary gift.\" His eyes registered a look of bewilderment. This was something new. A different side of Linda, or was it Kara? That he had never seen before. Tracing his lips in that sensous manner that only Kara could do, the kiss that followed made him completely forget why he was mad at her in the first place. He began devouring her lips and getting what was left of her coverings out of the way. \"Karalinda.\" he moaned as his manly urges made him hold her closer and tighter to his still clothed body. He could not remember how he unded up only in his briefs. Superspeed perhaps? \"I knew you couldn't resist.\" she teased him as he carried her to their bed.[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Heritage Island Daybreak was just about to begin as Linda and Ethan finally shut their eyes for some sleep. Their bodies spooning in satisfaction from their numerous acts of shared love that night. She was just getting used to the rhythm of Ethan's breathing as he exhaled unto the back of her neck. He held so tightly that she could not unwrap his arms from her waist so that she could roll over to her side of the bed. \"Kara...\" she heard the voice of Kal-El like a whisper in the winds. She shrugged and adjusted her position as best as she could within Ethan's grasp. Placing her hands on top of his. \"Wake up Kara. There is a power plant meltdown in Chicago. I need your help.\" Kal-El's voice was urgent. \"Kal - El? Where are you?\" she asked in a whisper. Careful not to wake Ethan. \"Waiting outside your window. Hurry.\" She glanced at the clock. 6 A.M. Ethan would be up by 8. After the way he acted the night before, flying off on another mission while he slept was not the way to make his mood any nicer. But what choice did she have? As a super being, this was her duty, to protect the weak and innocent. Prevent disasters when she could. \"But Ethan and I have not had any sleep yet. It is our anniversary.\" she tried to reason out. \"Kara-El, this is your duty. It is all the planet that gave you a home is asking for in exchange for all the good graces you have received. Surely Ethan will recognize the value of that. Now stop making excuses and get dressed.\" Kal-El ordered her sternly. Using controlled strength, she got out of his clutches and pulled off the 2nd blanket layer over her naked body. After getting into her Supergirl outfit and speedily writing a note to Ethan which she left on the bed, she flew off with Kal-El to deal with the problem. As if sensing that Kara had slipped away from his grasp, Ethan stirred in bed. Opening his eyes, he saw her jumping out the window. Kal-El flying beside her. \"Kara! Where are you going? \" he called after her. The paper she had placed on her pillow on the bed rustled as the wind from her flight breezed through the room. He opened the note and read the familiar handwriting of Linda: Ethan, Power plant emergency in Chicago. Kal-El needs my help. I knew you were tired so I did not wake you anymore. Sorry about not being able to make breakfast for you. I will make up for it tonight. I promise. Kara He crumpled the note and threw it out the window in disgust. Wishing the piece of paper to catch up with the superbeings and hit his wife on some part of her body. Maybe it would make her come back. What right had Kal-El to bring her on a mission without asking him first? He was her husband and he wished he would defer to him when it came to activities concerning his wife. **** The cousins flew directly to the Fortress of Solitude after cleaning up the toxic near disaster in Chicago. They were so attuned to each other's thoughts and movements that the rescue and clean up operation was flawless and accomplished in almost no time at all. However, due to the nature of the situation, neither of them wished to go back to their \"normal\" lives before undergoing the decontamination procedure that Kal-El had developed. Kara had just finished going through the decon cubicle and was just waiting for her Supergirl clothes to finish the same process. She was dressed in a similar attire as what she used to wear on Argo City. Only this time, she was actually wearing a dress made from burlap. She asked Kal=El to let her wear a similar attire when he first asked her to bring some clothes to the fortress in the event that she would need to change into human clothes while their outfits were \"fumigated\" as Kal-El termed it. The burlap gown was something she wore to honor her roots. It was customary for Kara to wait for Kal-El to get ready to leave on the days when their missions fell on a school day and he would most likely need to sign her excuse letter or personally make excuses for her at the college. He would still need a few minutes in the isolation chamber before they could be on their way back to Metropolis and Midvale respectively. She took the time to walk around the fortress and marvel at how it all evolved from a single Kryptonian crystal that Kal-El had plunged into the ice waters of the North pole decades earlier. She envied how he had this special place where he could be in touch with his Kyrptonian roots while she had lost all connections to Argo City during the explosion. Sometimes, she would sit in the backyard of her home and close her eyes, trying to recall everything about Argo City and her parents. Willing herself to never let go of the memories for that was all that she was left with. Those were the memories that defined who she had now become. Something seemed to be different in the fortress that day. Kara felt as though there were a pair of prying eyes watching her every move. The winds blowing through seemed to be whispering her name. Perhaps she was just hearing things? There was no one else in the fortress. It was protected by strong Kryptonian science from discovery by the mortal world. \"Kara...\" a female voice in the wind seemed to be calling to her. A familiar voice that she could not place. \"Hear us calling you Kara...\" another voice, was it a male voice? \"Uncle Jor-El?\" she called out for the only other worldy voice that was often heard in this isolated area was his. Her attention was called by the crystals that Kal-El had stacked neatly into their place holders in the supply area of the fortress. Each one was aglow with a color of the rainbow. These were the very same crystals that her parents had her bring to earth with her. She had never seen the crystals reacting to her presence this way before. Without any warning, a reddish blue crystal floated out of the holder and into her hand. \"Insert it into the reader. All shall now be revealed.\" the male voice that she was now sure she had heard before instructed her. Her hands trembled as she inserted the crystal. There was no mistaking it. The voices belonged to Alura and Zor-El. Why had they not told her about this crystal before the explosion? The images of her parents now stood before her. Standing tall and proud just like they did in life. A look of pride on their faces as they addressed Kara with love in their voices. \"We stand before you now, proud of the woman and protector of mankind that you have become. The activation of this crystal means that Kal-El has completed your training and now, the two of you are ready to take your places of honor as the Elders of a forgotten race. For you Kara-El and Kal-El are the Princess and Prince of Krypton.\" her father began to explain. She could not help but cry upon seeing her parents after all the years that had passed. It almost killed her to have to accept that they had died so violently and refused to have her save them. She tried to control her emotions. These were just projections. They were not real. Her parents were gone forever. Kara Did not notice Kal-El walk up behind her after seeing the lights bouncing off the icicles and walls. He too did not know why the crystals suddenly went active. He lightly touched her arm to let her know he was beside her. \"Take the Crystal of Heritage.\" the voice instructed. Immediately, a yellow green crystal floated towards them. Kara caught the prism and examined it carefully. These were the crystals her parents had packed. She had never seen these before. Somehow they both knew what to do with the crystal. Without another word, they flew off towards the center of the Pacific Ocean. Below them they saw dolphins and whales frolicking happily in the waters. They seemed to know that they had company. As if instructed by an unseen power, the two swam in a strange pattern. Creating an outline that reminded Kara of the Omegahedron. Without even thinking, Kara flew into the water towards the ocean floor. There she slammed the crystal as hard as she could into the sea bottom. Disturbing the sand and sending it in an upward spiral that thrust her out of the water as Kal-El watched on. **** Lucy glanced nervously at the clock as the bell rang to signal the start of the Creative Writing class. She was probably out saving the day somewhere and would be late for class as usual. She could only hope that Linda could still make the class before it was over. Professor Lucila Leighton was a stickler for attendance and Linda already had enough tardies for Leighton to have her within her sights. \"Logan, Linda Lee.\" Leighton had already reached the L's in the attendance roster. The woman who was in her late 40's lowered her oval shaped eyeglasses as she looked up from her record book towards the absent students seat. She was known as the best creative writing professor in the school who ran her classes like boot camps and was definitely not for students with only half an interest in her class. She placed the book on the table and looked directly at Lucy. \"Miss Lane, if your friend cannot attend my classes regularly, it would be best for you to advice her to drop my class. She is obviously not interested in what I have to teach and I am not interested in teaching students such as her.\" \"She'll be here Ms. Leighton. You know how married students are. They tend to get caught up in all sorts of stuff before class.\" Lucy tried to make a joke out of the situation. \"No I do not. She had no business marrying so early if she wanted to have a college education.\" she replied sternly. \"Yes ma'am.\" Lucy hated the days when Linda did not make it their classes. It was difficult for her to constantly have to come up with excuses for her. Oftentimes, she found herself wondering if Linda was just bad at juggling activities she should be good at multitasking at, or if Clark himself was the same way when he was in college. She made a mental note to discuss the situation with Clark if she ever got the chance. It would be useless to talk to Ethan about it since he never set foot in a college classroom in his life. \"We shall begin the lesson with a recap of our last topic. Now, who can tell me what a 2 dimensional character is? Mr. Lovitz? \" The class had officially begun. After what seemed like forever, the class finally ended with a short story writing assignment. Professor Leighton called Lucy over to her table when she passed by on her way out. \"Have Ms. Logan come to my office tomorrow after her classes. I wish to discuss one of her papers with her.\" she requested. \"Yes ma'am.\" Lucy replied. What trouble did Linda get herself into? Leighton never called a student to her office unless she could prove a paper was plagiarized and Linda would not even know the meaning of the word. **** Ethan arrived at the office with a dark cloud hovering above him. He was still mad because Linda left him with only a note as an explanation. As her husband, he felt and knew that he deserved more than that. When they were first married, he understoof why she had to suddenly fly off and do things without asking for his permission. But after 4 years of marriage, he now felt that she at least owed it to him to wake him up before jumping out the window to fight God knew what. The fear of her being exposed to the kryptonite rocks that were strewn all over Midvale always occupied his mind when he knew she was engaged in battle. \"What? No anniversary romp in the hay? \" Joel, his senior horticulturist kidded him upon seeing him walk into the office with a scowl that told everyone to lay off him. \"What goes on in my bedroom is my business!\" Ethan flared. He slammed the door to his office with a thud that shook the advertising posters off the walls. \"What's eating him?\" Joel asked Vicki who looked up from her work desk after the thud startled everyone within hearing distance. She was about to say something in jest about Ethan was obviously filled with sexual tension for some reason when her intercom sounded. \"Vicki, get me anything from the pantry for breakfast and a cup of hot coffee please.\" Ethan's voice came over the system. \"2 day old doughnuts ok?\" she asked, pressing the talk button on the machine. \"It'll do.\" he replied. \"There goes Vicki, the office wife.\" Joel kidded. She gave him a meaningful look as she stepped away from her desk. \"I won't be an office wife for long if Linda keeps this up.\" she muttered to herself as she prepared the food tray. **** A vortex the size of 3 football fields whirled fast and strong in the middle of the ocean where Kara and Kal-El stood hovering. The Crystal of Heritage seemed to be reclaiming land from the ocean. Sand was coming up and settling in a solid manner. Within a matter of hours, a circular tropical island had been formed. They flew in for a closer look at the Kryptonian technological marvel. \"Just as Kal-El has the Fortress of Solitude to call his home and share with you Kara, this island shall be your fortress to share with you Kal-El. An island where the history of our people and lessons learned by Kryptonians while on Argo City shall be stored for both of you to learn from and use whenever you need to. Kara, Kal-El, welcome to Heritage Island.\" the voice of Zor-El explained to them. On the island was a structure that reminded Kara so much of the Omegahedron. this was a dome held together by frames in blue and red. The House of El emblem distinctly seen in the middle. Flying closer, the emblem proved itself to be a hatch that opened up for them to fly through. Inside the structure carried the similar lay out as Kara's family unit in Argo City. Only on a larger scale. It had crystal readers and other equipment that were similar to what Kal-El had at the Fortress of Solitude. \"Father, why can I hear you? Where are you? Are you alive?\" Kara's voice was filled hope. \"It's computer generated Kara. They recorded their voices into the computer to help you respond better to the system. Just like my father did.\" Kal-El explained as he was familiar with the technology his father used to keep him in communication with his son from beyond his grave. \"We shall never die for as long as you live Kara. For our love for you and our constant protection exists within you.\" Alura's voice echoed through the hall. As they examined the place, they noticed that the crystals that were at the Fortress of Solitude began to magically materialize into holders in the command center of the dome. It became apparent that the crystals recognized their respective masters and Kara's knew to follow her to this place. For this is the place where the crystals belonged. \"Ethan and Lucy will never believe this.\" Kara's voice was awestruck as they flew back to Midvale in the early hours of the evening. She had officially missed all her classes that day. The cousins took one look back before continuing their flight. They saw the island sink into the water. Keeping itself protected from outside detection until one of them needed to use it again.[Chapter 3] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

The Mysterious Professor Leighton He was trying to concentrate on the paperwork strewn all over his office desk when Vicki walked in with the coffee and doughnuts. Placing the tray before him, she knew from his body language that there was trouble in the Logan household. \"What did Linda do this time?\" she asked him as she poured him some coffee. \"Nothing you would understand Vicki. Linda is a very complicated woman.\" he reached for the cup being held out to him. Vicki could never understand why Ethan always said that his wife was a complicated woman. As far as she knew, if anybody could explain the complexities of a woman to a man, it would be another woman. But the way Ethan treated Linda and spoke of her, you would think she were from another planet. In her opinion, he let her get away too many emasculating ways. She knew he was hurting from the way Linda had barely made the party the day before. But he always seemed to understand and shrug it off. if there was one thing Ethan was good at doing, it was making excuses for the constant irresponsibility of his wife. Why couldn't he just be honest and speak his mind about his wife's shortcomings? What made Linda so special that he would let her get away with anything, including constantly hurting his emotions? \"Sometimes I wonder why you married her. She isn't the marrying kind. Ethan, you deserve better.\" \"Please don't talk about my wife that way. You barely know her. \" he warned. \"Look, there is obviously something going wrong with your marriage. I mean, how many men would come back to work after their wedding anniversarry with a cloud of gloom hovering over them?\" she sat in the guest chair in front of his desk. She wasn't going to leave till she got some information that could be useful to her in the future. \"My marriage is doing fine Vicki. Linda and I are strong. We love each other.\" he insisted before taking a sip of coffee. \"Sometimes love isn't enough to keep the fire going in a relationship Ethan. Look, we all know you were both too young to understand what marriage really is all about when you jumped into it. Maybe you are regretting it now?\" He wasn't going to sit there and listen to all this poison talk. \"Please leave my office. You have no idea what you are talking about.\" \"Maybe you are tired of Linda? Maybe you want to try something new?\" What he wanted was for her to get out of his office before he told her anything he might regret about his wife. \"If you don't talk about it, your marriage will crumble.\" Ethan was too preoccupied with thoughts of all the times Linda had placed him second in her duties as Supergirl. At that moment, Vicki hit a nerve. \"I want my wife to stop putting me second to everything else! Is that what you want to hear? Are you happy now? Will you get off my case?\" he blurted out, slamming the coffee mug on the table. Vicki was stunned. She had never seen Ethan this upset before. He hurled the mug at the wall and then left the room. \"What was that all about?\" Joel popped his head into the room to ask her. **** Dinner was hot and ready by the time Ethan got home that night. She knew that he was going to be mad when he walked through the door. The one thing he had recently begun asking of her was that she stop flying off while he was asleep. He wanted to just once wake up with her still wrapped in his arms. That was what she tried to do that morning. Why did her duties always have to get in the way of her personal life? Were all married couples like this? Or was their situation quite different because of who she was? Glancing at the clock, she realized that she would be hearing his car coming down the road soon. She cocked her head in anticipation of the familiar hum of his engine. As soon as she heard it, she poured out a glass of lemonade for him and then went to wait for him by the door. \"Hi honey. Dinner is ready. Do you want to take a shower first?\" she handed him the glass which he did not accept. He still had a scowl on his face. \"I left you a note didn't I?\" she tried to explain. \"I was awake Linda. All you had to do was nudge me. You did not have to sneak out that way. \" he sat on the steps leading up to the rooms and took off his shoes. He always wore slippers at home. Explaining that he looked tired and she wanted him to have enough rest before having to go back to work, specially after all the drinks he had at the party were not enough to convince Ethan that Linda just preferred he catch up on sleep than worry about her. \"Did it ever occur to you that I would worry more when I woke up and you were gone? Kara, you know how dangerous it is for you to be flying around the city, more so when you are with Kal-El. His enemies are nothing like you are used to dealing with.\" Midvale did not really have any real criminal minds ever since she killed Selena. The worst kind of criminal she had faced so far was a simple bank robber. And he surrendered after he figured out that his bullets were only tickling Supergirl's skin. \"Ethan I...\" \"Let's just eat and go to bed okay? I am really tired tonight.\" He placed his shoes in the hall closet shelf and went on ahead to the dining area. **** Darkness had fully enveloped the city and only the bright moonbeams lit the dark street leading to the abandoned carnival. The gates that had no visible wiring system magically parted to let a red Toyota Corolla drive past. Parking in front of the decrepit horror train ride, Prof. Leighton alighted and walked up the now rickety wooden steps leading into the house. An eerie, wicked laughter greeted her as opened the door. \"Is that you Lucila?\" a husky female voice asked. \"It's me. I'm taking a shower and heading straight to bed. Don't bother with dinner.\" she instructed. A figure stepped out of the darkness of the kitchen. She was dressed in a red cloak and did her best to shield her face from the professor. She seemed afraid of Lucila for some reason. \"Did she come to school today?\" \"No. But I told her friend to make sure that she meets me before classes start tomorrow. Do you think you will have the strength to go with me?\" Lucila walked over to the minibar that was embedded in the floor and poured herself a glass of red wine. \"I will be there. I want to see the person who caused me so much pain and allowed an unjust punishment to be bestowed upon me without proper reason.\" \"I also won't let her get away with what she did to my mother. She made me an orphan and I will never forgive her for that.\" Even though she was already in her early 40's, Lucila still believed that she could have learned a lot more from her mother if only they were given the chance. \"Get me my mother's diary. I wish to read it before I go to bed.\" she instructed the woman who dragged her left leg as she walked about. Taking the book from the top of the refrigirator, the hand that held out the brown, velvety covered book to her was frost bite gray. **** They slept with their bodies turned away from each other that night. She knew that he was merely pretending to be asleep to avoid having to talk to her. How did Kal-El manage it? How could he have a life and still be able to do everything that their super duties dictated? Did he have episodes with Lois like she was having with Ethan more frequently now? Linda could not fall asleep. She needed to be in his arms, feeling safe and secure, like he did every night with her. He would hold her so close to him that she could hear the every beat of his heart. She knew his heart rhythm so well that it was like a lullaby for her. This was the first time, in the history of all the fights that they had, where he refused to hug her while they slept. \"Will you keep still. I am asleep over here.\" he requested as he continued to feign sleep. She did her best to lie in the prone position without moving, but then she felt a terrible pain in her stomach. It was as if Kal-El had kicked her during one of their training sessions. The pain made her sit up in bed. Something was wrong. Linda never pain like this before. It was only a little less than the pain of a Kryptonite shard embedding into her skin. \"Ethan... Ethan, I need your help.\" she hunched over in pain, her breathing labored. \"Let me sleep.\" he rolled over in bed so that his back was now facing her. The pain began to subside and was replaced by a strange sensation in her stomach. What was going on? She would need to fly to the island the next day and ask if her parents knew anything that could make her feel ill. **** \"Better head to Leighton's office before class starts.\" Lucy told her as they took their seats in class. \"Did she say why?\" Linda took out a handkerchief and wiped her brow. She was really worried about the human tendencies that she had been displaying since the night before. Something Ethan did not notice because he left for work without having any breakfast or saying goodybe to her. She just heard his car drive off while she was in the shower. \"What is the matter with you Linda?\" \"I haven't the faintest idea. Maybe this is how somebody sick feels? \" she leaned back into her student chair in the hopes that the dizziness that she was beginning to feel would go away. \"Sweat and illness are the two things that are not expected of Linda Lee Logan or Clark Kent.\" Lucy was visibly worried as she tried to feel her friend's forehead for her temperature. \"I'm fine. Just accompany me to Leighton's office will you?\" \"We've got 10 minutes before class. We better hurry.\" Lucy assisted her out of her seat. ***** Prof. Leighton's office was located in the Willis Faculty building 5 minutes away from where their classes were held. Linda did her best to compose herself before knocking on the glass door that bore the name of their teacher. \"Come in.\" Prof. Leighton immediately set aside her mother's diary in the right hand drawer of her desk. \"You wanted to see me professor?\" Linda continued to sweat heavily. She was not beginning to look ill. \"Yes. It's about this short story you wrote for our class, \"The Adventures of Arak in Orga City.\" I like what you wrote. It shows a lot of imagination and a strong grasp of the science fiction genre. I want you to enter it in the school's creative short story contest.\" she began, taking out the short essay from a pile of other papers on her desk. \"Professor, I never meant for that to be...\" \"Don't tell me it never occurred to you that you really have the talent for this.\" Leighton held out the application form to her. She was obviously not going to take no for an answer. \"I haven't. I mean, I don't think I can compete. It's only my first written story...\" \"Piece of advise Ms. Logan, when your professor tells you to go for it, you are supposed to say, thank you for the opportunity.\" she forced the application form into her student's hand. Linda held the form in her hands and stared at it for a while. \"Thank you Prof. Leighton.\" \"Now then, I will see you in class.\" \"Yes Ma'am.\" she got up from her chair and turned on her heels out the door. The professor got up from her seat and closed the blinds in her office to block out the morning sun. The familiar cloaked figure materialized within a cloud of a lightly swirling fog in the middle of the room. \"Was that her Bianca? Is she the one who can lead me to my mother's killer?\" \"Yes Lucila, that is \"the wimp\" as your mother called her. It is only a matter of time now.\"[Chapter 4] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

The Seeds of A Legacy Selena Rebecca Stanwyck had always been interested in the occult as a child. Maybe it was because her mother allowed her to watch all those comical witch shows back in the day. Influenced by shows like Bewitched and I Love Jeannie, she found herself being drawn more and more towards the possible actual basis of the magick andf occult that she saw performed on the show. It was later on life when she met and fell in love with the man who would become Lucila's father, a drifter who taught Selena how to read tarot cards and tea leaves. After leaving her stranded with their child near Lake Tahoe, Selena fell into the company of Nigel who brought her back to Midvale and introduced her to Bianca. The Vinzenzo Circus was owned by the family of Bianca Maria for many generations. The business came into Bianca's hands eventually and collapsed under her mismanagement. Nigel hoped that by having Selena as part of the circus would help her out. Afterall, Selena's talent as a seer and magician was known far and wide in Lake Tahoe. Try as the women did, Selena had simply arrived too late to save the circus. Choosing to live with Bianca so that she could continue her training with Nigel, she sent Lucila to live with her grandparents indefinitely. **** \"I did not hear much from her mother after I left. She never asked to see me and would not even let me visit her during the vacation periods. I grew up practically an orphan Bianca. I never really knew my mother. Even her own parents would rather pretend she did not exist because they said she was the worst possible kind of rebel. I would not have even known that she had died so violently in the hands of that freak if her death were not openly spoken about here in Midvale when I returned to look for her.\" Lucila related over a cup of tea with Bianca. They were back at the abandoned circus now and poring over Selena's old journals and Book Of Shadows, hoping to find a clue as to how to finally kill Supergirl. For that was the revenge that she longed for. \"These journals speak of a magical sphere called the Omegahedron and a place called Argo City. Mother said the ball taught her about the most powerful magick in the world and the location of the center of power, Argo City.\" as she slowly scanned the rest of the pages, a slow dawning came upon her. She had read these depictions before. But as a fictional place. Could it be? Bianca cringed at the mention of the Omegahedron and Argo City. After the vortex had sucked her and Selena into the Phantom Zone, they had done their best to find their way back to their real plane. It was during one of these quests that Bianca had fallen to what Selena probably thought was her death. Falling for what seemed like an infiniti, Bianca's body had frozen in the frigid temperatures of the Phantom Zone where she was held in suspended animation until the explosion of Argo City. Her frozen status had prevented her death as she was thrown through the packets of time and space until she came to rest in the forest of Midvale, physically broken but mentally alert. She had dragged herself barely alive back to the carnival where she used whatever herbs, potions and spells she could remember to help her heal. It was only a year ago when Lucila had returned to the place and discovered her existence, helping to nurse her to the point of recovery that she was now at. Her whole body was blackish gray in color due to frostbite. The hands and feet she had were only slightly functioning thanks to the potions that Lucila regularly mixed for her to drink. Lucila took out a file folder from her briefcase and leafed through the pages, searching for one paper in particular, the 2nd short story that Linda had submitted to her just a few days ago in class. Finding the paper, she set them side by side on the table. Comparing the contents. Was this a case of plagiarism? Or was it something else totally? \"Bianca, read these, then tell me who copied whose work.\" she held out the documents for her to take. Reclining in her chair, she gave the woman enough time to finish reading and analyzing the documents. \"Well I'll be...\" Bianca's mouth gaped open in amazement. \"Linda Lee Logan's work is not fictional.\" Lucila's jaw visibly hardened as she realized the implications of what she had just uncovered. **** \"Aaaaahhhhhh! Ethan!\" Linda suddenly sat up in bed as the pain in her stomach became more unbearable by the minute. Startled by her actions, he sat up in bed and instinctively cradled her in his arms. He liked the feeling she gave him each time she called out his name because she needed him. He competely forgot who she was during these vulnerable moments. All that mattered to him was that she needed him and not Kal-El. That there were actually times in her life when she needed her husband more than her cousin. \"Shhhhh... It's okay Linda. I'm here. It's okay baby. \" he gave her a kiss on the cheek and tried to massage her back. He thought she had had another of her nightmares about the implosion of Argo City. For all the strength that she possessed as Kara, she was weak when it came to the memories of her past life. \"No Ethan... the pain... I don't know why... Is... is there any sort of kryptonite around?\" His body went numb. Who would bring Kyrptonite into their house? Did anybody know that Linda and Supergirl were... Wait. Linda did not think that he would... Would she? Whatever differences they had at that very moment were forgotten. He loved her so much and the idea that she thought he would do that to her... \"No honey, there is no Kryptonite in our home. You are protected here. I will protect you. Always. I love you. \" he reassured her. \"Then why do I feel this way?\" Her sweat had already drenched her nightshirt to her underwear which was now very visible under her thin shirt. \"You're burning up.\" he touched his hand to her forehead and immediately drew it back. \"Lie back. I'll go get the ice pack.\" \"No Ethan! Don't leave me!\" Linda grabbed his arm in fear as he dropped out of their bed. \"You'll be fine Linda. Don't worry. I'll only be a minute.\" **** Her body heat melted the icepacks so fast that the ice melted and the water evaporated upon contact with her skin. Nearing his wits end, he begged her to get up from bed and go to the bathroom. She barely had the strength to walk but still managed to drag herself into the bathtub which he had filled with ice cold water from the tap. \"Urrrk..\" she threw her head over the side of the tub and vomitted a brownish red gel like substance. Ethan knew he was in over his head. There was nothing he could possibly do for his wife. It was time to call for help. Using the bedroom phone, he dialled the all to familiar number that he always called when Linda was late getting home from a mission. \"Clark Kent.\" came the sleepy voice on the other end of the line. \"Clark, it's Linda. She is throwing up and having stomach pains.\" \"Have you checked for Kryptonite exposure?\" Clark immediately switched into Kal-El mode. \"No, this is nothing like Kryptonite poisoning. I don't know what to do. Should I take her to the emergency room?\" \"What good would that do? No, just wait for me. I will be there in 2 minutes.\" **** \"Kara, Kara - El can you hear me?\" Kal-El lightly slapped her cheeks as she lay back, listless and seemingly unconscious in the tub. Ethan had kept the cold water running through it because her body temperature was causing the stocked water to boil. \"My stomach... I can't...\" she whispered loud enough only for him to hear. Touching her submerged stomach he realized that it was distended and larger than it had been the day before when they had visited Heritage Island. Could she have caught some sort of Kryptonian illness there? \"I can't help her here Ethan. I need to take her to the fortress.\" Kal-El explained upon seeing the status of his cousin. She was slumped over the edge of the tub now, too weak to move or even acknowledge his presence in the room. \"Can't we just...\" \"Ethan, you know very well that no human medicine or doctor can help her. I need to get her analyzed by our equipment.\" The anger on Ethan's face was slowly replaced by helplessness at the realization that for all the love he shared with this woman, he would always be too helpless to actually do anything for her once her life became endangered. He would have no choice but to let Kal-El take her once again to save the day. He nodded his head in exasperation as Kal-El picked up Kara without any effort. Something that he envied because he could never lovingly pick her up. Even though Kara was svelte in build, the reality was that as a Kryptonian, she weighed far more than the most obese human being. \"I will come back and let you know how she is doing.\" Kal-El assured him before he took off with Kara from the backyard. **** \"Father, we need your help.\" he called upon the database that Jor-El has stored into the computers of the fortress. \"What is troubling you my son?\" came the voice of his father as he placed Kara on the examination table in the middle of the room. This was the same table that he lay on each time he needed to heal after being exposed to various sorts of Kyrptonite. The analysis helmet immediately came up and enclosed the top area of Kara's head. Other sensor wires also came up and automatically attached to various parts of her neck, arms, wrists, and legs. His vital signs monitor immediately powered up and began monitoring his cousin whom he hoped was asleep and not unconscious. \"Kara is ill. I need to know why and what is causing it.\" he ordered. \"Impossible Kal-El. There is no way that Kyrptonians can ever fall ill on this planet. This place was specifically chosen for the two of you because of the invincibility the exposure to the earth's gravity and yellow sun offered. \" Jor-El explained even as the sensors began analyzing Kara's weakened body. \"Well something is making her sick father and I fully intend to find out what it is.\" \"There is nothing in my database to explain why her stomach would bloat and expand that way Kal-El. My records were not set up to handle the female anatomy of our race.\" \"Mother, help me mother!\" Kara cried out as she began throwing up the substance again. Her stomach seemed to be much bigger now and worried Kal-El even more. Without even thinking twice, he picked her up and flew off in the direction of Heritage Island. Maybe Alura and Zor-El's records held the key to the cure. **** \"There is a strange DNA strain coursing through and attacking her system. Her antibodies are trying to destroy it.\" Alura's voice explained as various laser lights passed over Kara's body. Without warning, the green laser stopped at her stomach and turned into various shades of red and blue as the scanner deepened its scan of her system. The monitor was showing him her reproductive system now. Kal-El could not believe what he was seeing. \"No, this is impossible. Our studies indicated that the human system is highly inferior to ours. There is no way this could have happened.\" Alura's voice was filled with amazement at the discovery. \"No amount of coitus with a human being should have produced this result. No human is capable of doing it. Our studies have never been wrong before.\" Zor-El's voice interrupted. \"Your studies neglected to take into consideration the power of love between two people. Love is what creates a new life. Love is what Ethan and Kara have been overflowing with for each other since the day they first met.\" Kal-el reasoned out. \"This is what is making our daughter ill.\" she explained to Kal-El who was staring at the screen in utter confusion and amazement. So it was possible after all. Lois would be pleased to know this bit of news. \"How do we cure her?\" he finally asked. \"Her system will eventually adapt to the ongoing changes. This will all go by very quickly. Kal-El, you must be prepared to deal with it. Where is the husband?\" Zor-El asked. \"I shall bring him here immediately.\" Kal-El immediately flew off. Leaving the resting Kara on the island. **** Ethan was sitting in the backyard with a cup of coffee in hand. The sun was about to come up and he still had not had any sleep. How could he sleep when he did not know what was wrong with his wife? The soft rustling of the bushes told him that either Kal-El or Kara, or both had finally come back. He hoped to see his her smiling face when he looked up. Instead, it was the jubilant face of Kal-El that greeted him. \"Come with me.\" He picked up Ethan by the arm and flew off. \"Is Linda going to be alright?\" \"No worries. She will be fine.\" \"What was wrong?\" \"Nothing was wrong. Everything is alright. Everything is perfect.\" He smiled proudly at his cousin-in-law. **** With the help of her parent's technology, Kara finally overcame the worst of her pains and had fallen asleep. Her body had finally sorted out the changes happening within her and soon would be ready to perform the task that it was due to complete. \"Meet your parent's in law Ethan.\" he introduced Alura and Zor-El to Ethan as their holographic images presented themselves when they landed in the dome. \"What? Where am I?\" he tried to collect his wits about him. He was still trying to get used to the idea of the Fortress of Solitude and now Kal-El had taken him to a new and strange island. \"You are standing on Heritage Island. Kara's own private piece of Argo City on Earth.\" Kal-El explained while Ethan tried to take in as much of the dome as he could. \"What are we doing here?\" \"Ethan, you have done something that our Kryptonian science said was impossible. Your relationship with our daughter has rendered eons of human study on our part in error. \" The image of Zor-El flickered as he spoke, Alura standing by his side with an expression of deep concern on her face. \"Where's Kara?\" Ethan began to worry. He had not seen her since they arrived. He seemed to not have heard a word they said. She had been placed in an isolation chamber to help ease her pains as her stomach steadily grew in size. It was only a matter of time now. \"Ethan, there is something you need to understand.\" Kal-El began to explain as he led the way to the isolation chamber. \"Wow! What the hell is happening to Kara! What did you do to her?\" Ethan was both surprised and angered by the status of his wife. She was now pale gray in color and seemed to be sapped of all strength. The one thing the isolation chamber could not cancel out were her painful moans at she entered the final stages of the process. \"She's pregnant Ethan, and in labor.\" The words struck him hard. \"What???? What the hell are you talking about?\" he leaned back against the glass wall of the room for support. His legs seemed to suddenly lack the strength to keep him standing. \"You are about to become a father.\" Kal-El stated matter of factly. \"No. Kara told me it wasn't possible. That's why we never used protection. Human's can't get Kryptonians pregnant and vice versa!\" he wasn't sure what to feel at that moment. \"It's possible. Look at the monitor.\" Kal-El pulled the touch screen closer to them to show Ethan the progress of the fetus. It was now a full term baby ready to join the world. \"All the stomach pain and throwing up, it was her system going haywire because of the human DNA that fertilized her egg. The zygote made her sick because your DNA is a foreign body. Her system came under attack as it speedily developed into an embryo. The system did not know what to do with your sperm. We were finally able to stabilize her system enough to allow the fetus to develop without doing her further harm. \" \"But the infanticipating process takes 9 months.\" Ethan tried to recall his human reproduction lessons in high school. \"For humans. But in Kara's case, it was sped up. Everything about her is different here. Normally, a Kryptonian pregnancy takes 5 months. \" Alura's voice spoke out of nowhere. \"Who said that?!\" \"That was your mother in law.\" Kal-El explained. \"Kara's parents survived?\" \"No. These are just computer reproductions of their voices.\" Ethan looked confused and dumbfounded more than ever. \"Kal-El, it's time!\" Zor-el's voice had a sense of urgency to it. The monitors attached to Kara were also sending off deafening warning signals. \"Wait here!\" he ordered Ethan as the glass door before them slid open. Ethan watched as Kal-El cut Kara's nightshirt open to reveal her over extended stomach that looked ready to explode. Kara lay a sweating heap on the table, grimacing in pain. \"Ethan! I need Ethan!\" she screamed as Kal-El marked the area he was going to cut through with the sanitized crystal blade. \"Talk to her.\" Alura prodded him. \"She can't hear me.\" he felt creeped out to be speaking to the disembodied voice of his mother-in-law. \"She can and she will. Trust her. Trust what you feel for her to connect the two of you.\" He took a deep breath before thinking of the words he wanted to tell her. \"I'm here Kara. You are not going through this alone.\" the words raced through his mind. To his amazement, he heard her answer the same way. \"I did not know... Are you happy? I told you it could never happen. I was wrong. We never discussed starting a family...\" He saw Kal-El use his gloved hands to pry her stomach open. Taking the child out of the placenta, he cut the umbilical cord and turned away with the child in his arms. \"The two of you have now come full circle. You have a family now. A healthy child.\" He heard Kal-El's thoughts as well. There was something strange about this island as far as Ethan was concerned. People seemed to communicate only by thoughts and spoke to people who were dead. But he was not going to dwell on that now. They were thrust into a role neither of them were ready for. Was Kara ready to be a mother? Was he ready to be a father?[Chapter 5] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

The two men allowed Kara to rest after the ordeal she had just gone through. Kal-El took charge of cleaning up the first child in the new generation of Kryptonians, a baby girl whose looks duplicated that of her mother with a slight hint of her father's genes. She had Kara's strong jaw line, mouth, and eyes to prove her Kryptonian heritage while also embodying her human father through her nose structure, skin, and hair color. It was still too soon to tell how much of the Kryptonian traits the child carried... or not. Kal-El had gone back to Metropolis to let them know the good news and ask for their help in preparing the Logan household for the new arrival. Ethan stood over the makeshift crib in what seemed to be Kara's bedroom on the island, watching his daughter sleep in the crib that Kal-El had fashioned out of the stalactites hanging in this cave that sheltered them. The child was wrapped in a blanket that carried the House Of El coat of arms, the all too familiar S emblem. He still could not believe that he and Kara had brought this child into the world in such an amazing way. He was still in disbelief at the thought that he was now a father and Kara, a mother. They had no time to prepare. How did one act as a parent? More importantly, how does one parent a child whose mother was not of this earth? Surely the child would have the same skills has her mother and uncle. Was Ethan ready to have a child who could whip his butt if he so much as scolded her for missing curfew? All too suddenly, he began feeling emasculated. Now he not only had a wife who could whip him with one hand tied behind her back and blindfolded, but he had a child, whose abilities were still unknown, who could toss him around their house as a form of child's play. But as he watched her sleeping, so helpless and serene, at that very moment, the one instinct that overtook his being was protectiveness. He knew that for a portion of this child's life, she would need a father to protect her and love her unconditionally. His protective feelings were further heightened by the realization that she would probably be less prone to the negative effects of Kryptonite exposure because of the human genes within her. But nobody really knew anything at this point. How human was she? Or was she all Kryptonian? All of these thoughts and mixed emotions were running through his mind. There was very little he could do to process it all constructively. \"Ethan? Honey, come and lie beside me.\" Kara's voice was still weak from the effects of the cesarian section Kal-El had performed on her. The cut had healed almost immediately but she still needed time to regain her strength. Slipping into bed next to her, he pulled her closer to him so that her head now rested on his shoulder. She closed her eyes in contentment. Wishing that they could just stay on the island and live that way forever. \"Kara...\" he whispered her name as her breathing began to indicate that she was falling asleep. \"Huunh?\" \"I love you and our child more than either of you will ever know.\" he professed in a very low voice so as not to wake the child. \"I know Ethan.\" she breathed her reply as she began to doze off. He too felt tired from taking care of Kara all night. After a long yawn, he began to nod off to sleep as well. For a long time, all was perfect on Heritage Island. The line of succession had been insured and the Kryptonian legacy was sure to pass onto the next generation of children. Even if they were only half breeds, the House of El's existence was insured. **** Kal-El had flown all the way back to the Kent family farm in Smallville to get all of his childhood furniture for his niece. Flying to and from the Logan house with the speed of light, he had managed to transfer all the things needed within a matter of minutes. Taking the spare key from he bottom of the fake rock in the patio flowerbed, he entered the house and got on the phone. \"Lois? Clark here. I need you to round up Jimmy and Lucy then come down to Linda's place. There is something we need to do for them. Tell you guys all about it when you get here.\" **** \"So you are telling me that you are now an uncle?\" Lois asked him as the group moved the furniture out of Linda's study and into Ethan's office. Since her study was closest to the master's bedroom, it was decided that it would serve the higher purpose of being a nursery to the child. \"I am now a proud uncle of a first generation Kryptonian.\" Clark beamed as he lifted the book shelf, with all the books intact, off the floor and into the next room. \"Does she have a name yet? I hope it isn't something cheesy like Frangipani.\" Lucy asked while wallpapering the room with sky blue wallpaper adorned with running puppies and kittens. \"I happen to like the Frangipani blossom.\" Lois countered as she set down the basket of baby supplies she had picked up on her way to the house. \"No, no, they haven't chosen a name yet. Linda is still resting.\" \"Can we visit her? Where is she? At Midvale Gen?\" Jimmy asked while continuing to smear the walls with paste. \"Well... it's kinda complicated.\" Clark began. **** The soft cry of their daughter woke the sleeping couple. Their faces registered confusion and wonder as they looked into each others eyes, looking for a clue as to what to do now that the child was awake. \"What do we do?\" Ethan reached for his shirt at the foot of the bed and put it on. Unlike the arctic freeze temperature at the Fortress of Solitude, Heritage island's climate reminded him more of Hawaii. She leaned against the wall and thought back to her Kryptonian biology lessons. She was a mother now. What did the lesson say? \"Ethan, bring her to me.\" she finally figured out why the child may have been softly crying. \"I can't pick her up!\" Ethan complained for two reasons. First of all, he had no idea how to carry a baby and second, he was not sure the child would be light enough for him to carry since he could not even carry her mother in his arms. \"She hasn't been exposed to the yellow sun yet. You can do it.\" she encouraged him. \"Please try?\" \"So that is where all your power comes from? Our planet's sun? Then why don't you weaken at night?\" He never really did understand where the cousins got their power from. He never bothered to ask Kara and she never bothered to volunteer information about it either. \"We take our power from two sources, the yellow sun and the earth's gravitational pull. Now please, get our daughter before she starts getting louder.\" Kara motioned towards the crib as the soft cry was beginning to turn into a wail. He was surprised at how light she was when he took her into his arms. Gingerly supporting her head, he held her as close as possible to his own body while taking her back to the bed. As if knowing that she was in her father's arms, the little one curled her baby lips into a smile. Ethan could not help but smile back at her and give her a loving kiss on the forehead. Kara carefully took her and held her close to her chest. The sound of her heartbeat seemed to have a soothing effect on the child who nuzzled up to her and then opened her smiling eyes at the woman who had just given her life. Her tongue darting in and out as Kara playfully tickled her chin. \"I think she's hungry.\" Kara surmised as the child began to cry again. \"Hungry... right... how do we... how do you... we don't have anything to feed to her!\" Ethan was feeling exasperated. What a mess they had drawn themselves into. \"No,no.. we don't need anything except this.\" Kara dropped the left shoulder of her gown low enough so that she could offer her exposed breast to the baby who took to her nipple almost immediately. \"How did you know?\" Ethan wondered. The last thing he imagined was that Kryptonian women breastfed their young. \"Isn't this what Earth mother's do? This is how it was done on Krypton and Argo City.\" \"Yes, it's just that I never thought...\" \"Our people carry more similarities than just love and sex Ethan.\" she smiled lightly at him. Coming closer to his family, he thought about how perfect their life was now that they had their unexpected bundle of joy. She was the culmination of their love. The bond that would forever join their hearts and souls no matter what happened in their lives. But they could not go around the rest of their lives referring to the baby as \"her\". \"We need to name her already.\" he suggested. \"We can't keep calling the baby \"it\" and \"her.\" \"I know honey. Have you got any ideas?\" Kara adjusted her holding pattern to make the child and herself more comfortable during the feeding process. The child cooed as she adjusted the feeding position after the nipple slipped out of her mouth. He thought for a while before replying. \"I'm drawing a blank. If we had a son, I know what his name would have definitely been. \"Ethan Logan Jr.\" Kara replied as she lovingly lowered her head onto his shoulder. The baby was beginning to fall asleep again. \"That's it! The perfect name for our baby!\" Kara pronounced excitedly after a few moments of silence between them had passed. 'You can't name her Ethan!\" he began to protest. \"No silly! We'll name her after me.\" The baby finally closed her eyes again and let go of her mother's nipple. Kara took the opportunity to cover up her exposed breast with one hand. \"Which name?\" \"Both.\" \"Kara Linda? Nice.\" \"No. Not 2 names. Just one.\" \"Karalinda.\" Ethan smiled as he said his petname for his wife. It was a term he used when he was just overflowing with his love and desire for her. \"Exactly. Karalinda. She is the final outcome of my humanization Ethan. She is whom I wish to be, just one person. She is the hybrid of all that makes me Kryptonian and human. The combination of my two personages in one being.\" \"Karalinda....\" Ethan seemed to think about it for a moment then smiled. \"I like it.\" \"Our little Karalinda.\" Kara lovingly placed the child on the space between them so they could continue to watch her as she slept. \"She's Kali. To me, you will always be my Karalinda.\" he reached over to the back of her head and slowly brought her closer to share a kiss. \"Come to mother Kali.\" Kara lovingly picked up the child after they parted. **** Lucila drove up to the front of the Logan house with the full intention of being invited inside so she could stake out the enemy territory and figure out how to attack Linda at her weakest moment. She needed to know if her mother was speaking the truth. That the wimp and Supergirl were one and the same person. She needed more proof than just the similar creative writing stories that Linda was submitting in class. \"I'm sorry we can't invite you in.\" Clark informed her. \"Linda and Ethan are not here and we are trying to get some repairs done before they get back. \" \"Will she be back in school on Monday?\" she asked. \"If she can get some help around the household, she will be.\" Clark responded. He stepped out of the door and closed it behind him. \"What kind of help? Maybe I can be of assistance?\" \"No, really, it is a family problem.\" He was referring to the babysitting problem that Linda would be facing when she got back from the island. \"Well, if you need any help at all...\" \"Actually, \" Clark cut her off so that he could get a word in edgewise. \"It would be great if ou could give Linda some time off from school. Maybe give her homework instead?\" \"Whatever for Mr. Kent? She is doing wonderfully in class.\" \"She just needs the time. There is a big adjustment happening in her life right now.\" \"I am sure Linda can explain such a request to me. I will be back tomorrow to talk to her. Please let her know.\" Lucila knew when something was not going her way. \"Of course. I'm really sorry you missed them.\" Clark replied. **** \"Did you do it?\" Bianca asked Lucila upon her return. She was itching to begin exacting their revenge on Linda Lee Logan and Supergirl. \"No. She wasn't there and her cousin would not let me in. There will be another chance.\" Lucila walked over to the fridge and took out a can of beer. \"Catch.\" she threw the other can towards Bianca who caught and opened it. \"What are we toasting to?\" Bianca wanted to know as she took a long sip to stop the foam from spilling out. \"The beginning of the demise of Supergirl.\" Lucila held her can up in the air as a toast.[Chapter 6] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

A Painful Revelation Havingnregained her strength, Kara was now busy preparing for the flightnback home. As she straightened up the quarters, she could not helpnbut wonder at the miracle of life that came out of her not more thann48 hours ago. Watching Ethan carry Kali in his arms, he looked soncontent, happy, and fulfilled. She wondered when the last time wasnthat Ethan looked at her with those eyes filled with love andnadmiration. The baby changed a lot between them. Now they had anothernlife to be responsible for. Their lives had changed without warning.nLittle did Ethan know that Kara was filled with dread at having to gonback to their normal lives in Midvale. She was filled withnapprehension at the thought of what powers Kali might accidentallyndisplay in public. Did she have any powers? Was her daughter halfnKryptonian or all human? Seemingly hearing her thoughts, hernmother's voice echoed throughout the room. \"Kara, Ethan, please go tonthe communication center. Zor-El and I have some things to explainnbefore you leave. \" \"On our way mother.\" Karanresponded. Making a motion to take Kali from Ethan, she signaled fornhim to follow her. The cave was huge and confusing to those who didnnot live on Argo City in the past. \"I can handle her.\" Ethannturned away from Kara, refusing to give up the child in his arms. She smiled at him. Letting him enjoynhis daughter in his arms was the least she could do for him. Afternall, he had done everything he could to help her ease into the humannworld during all those years when she needed someone to give hernunwavering support. Now, they would both need to be very supportiveneach other as they faced the lifelong task ahead of them. The huge monitor in the room had beennturned on and showed an animated growth chart which Kara understoodnwithout any explanation. The computers had projected the changes thatnKali would undergo the minute she left the island and was exposed tonthe yellow sun. She felt extreme sadness as the thought that Ethannwas going to be disappointed with matters that he was powerless tonchange. A pair of wide rocks jetted out ofnthe walls within the solid rock floor. It reminded Kara of the seatsnthey had back on Argo City. Perhaps this is why her parents chose toncall this place Heritage Island. Everything about it made her feelnvery comfortable and at home. It was like being back on Argo City andnbringing her new family with her for a visit. Everything that made the islandnspecial to Kara was actually beginning to get on Ethan's nerves. Itnwas only slowly beginning to dawn upon him that he knew nothing aboutnhis wife's past life. Where she came from, what it was like there,nwho she was there. All he knew about her was who she chose to becomenon Earth -- Linda. All of a sudden, he felt like he did not know thisnwoman who had given him this child. Zor-El's voice floated from an unseennsource as the monitors in the room magically came to life. \"There are some things thatnthe two of you must understand about Kali before you leave thenisland. She is not an ordinary baby and special care andnunderstanding will be required, most specially of you Ethan. Sincenyou are not familiar with the Kyryptonian ways. \" \"Whatnis it that I need to understand? Is my child an alien?\" henasked. A moot question since Kara was not of the human race either.nBut she looked, felt, and acted as a human. She was human in everyneay as far as he was concerned. She just wasn't born on earth. Hisndaughter was, she was human, more human than Kryptonian then. \"Ethan,nwhen Kara first came to earth, she was only 12 years old. But thenlength of time it took to travel to earth from innerspace and hernexposure to the sun and gravity of the planet rapidly aged her by 3nyears. She was the equivalent of a 16 year old earthling when you metnher. The same thing is going to happen to Kali when you leave thisnisland. What we cannot predict, is how much aging will happen whennshe is exposed to the same elements because of her human DNA.\" Zor-Elnexplained. Ethan had no idea that Kara hadnrapidly aged when she entered the earth's atmosphere. But since itnwas a thing of her past, he concerned himself more with the future ofnthis daughter. What were they trying to say? \"So when we leave here...\" \"Thenatmosphere of the island is equal to that of Argo City. Here, shenwill age as any normal child would. But when you leave, she willnundergo a rapid aging process and we do not know how far advanced shenwill be in mental and physical development by the time you land atnyour home.\" Thenanger that registered on Ethan's face was one that Kara had nevernseen before. He looked like he was ready to explode as he looked uponnKali. \"Talk to me Ethan. Honey...\"nshe held him when she noticed his body begin to shake. He allowed hernto take the child from his arms at that point. He felt cheated. So, his daughter wasnnot human after all. He would be cheated out of the important eventsnin her life by alien science. There as nothing about the child thatnwould be a part of him. \"...Butneventually, the rapid aging should cease as her human DNA begins toncompletely merge with the Kryptonian genes within the child.\" Ethan no longer heard Zor-El's words. All he could hear was that hisnchild was not normal. She wasn't going to grow like a human child andnhe would be cheated out of being part of her everyday development asna child. \"No! My child is normal! Ournchild is normal! Tell me the truth Kara! Tell me Kali is human innsome way!\" He demanded of his wife who was overcome by thenshocking anger in his voice. \"Ethan... I... I don't know... Incan't....\" She stammered as she tried to find the right words tontell him. \"Shencannot tell you anything Ethan. This is the first case of ancross-breed child in the history of our race. Kali is the first ofnher kind and therefore, we should all learn that the unexpectednshould be expected.\" Thendrone of the computer generated voice made Ethan want to hurlnsomething at the console in disgust. The dome above slowly opened up tonallow Kal-El to fly in. \"Everyone ready to go back to Midvale?\" \"In a minute Kal-El\" Karantugged on Ethan's shirt sleeve to lead him back to their room. \"Ethan, please, don't be thisnway. Kali is our child. Regardless of what powers she displays orndoes not display, she is still half of me and half of you.\" shentried to reason with him. Placing the child into his arms, shenwatched as he went over to the bed and sat down. He was staring atnthe baby with sadness in his eyes. This was not what he was expectingntheir family life to be like. He at least expected her to have annormal childhood. To build up memories of her growing up and swappingnstories with his other employees who already had daughters of theirnown. \"I just need time to let theninformation sink in Kara. Please don't rush me.\" **** Kara cradled their daughter in hernarms as they flew back to Midvale. He thought was filled with worrynas Ethan displayed signs of rejecting their daughter because of thenunexpected revelation. She could only hope that he would eventuallynget on board and realize that Kali still needed her father's love,neven if she was not totally human. Just as Zor-El had predicted, Kalinhad aged by one year before they were able to land in Midvale. Thenchild that she had cradled in her arms upon taking off from HeritagenIsland was now sitting atop her mother's back and holding on to herncape. \"Here's the new family!\"nLucy declared as the group touched down in the backyard of the house.nThey had put together a small spread and a small cake with the wordsn\"Welcome to the World Baby Logan\" printed across it. \"Woah! That's no newborn baby!\"nJimmy declared upon seeing the little girl disembark from hernmother's back. The clothes of the child needed changing as it hadnripped all over her body during the rapid aging process. \"Kara! What happened? Rapidnaging only happens...\" Kal-El asked in surprise. \"Father explained that there wasnno way we could predict what would happen to Kali when we left thenisland.\" She looked at Ethan as she tried to explain why thennewborn baby was now taking toddler steps with her help. \"Who cares Clark?\" Loisninterrupted. \"What matters is that everybody is fine and in thenpink of health.\" The room fell silent as they watchednthe little girl grasp her mother's hand and then stick her thumb intonher mouth. \"I think we should go get what'snher name dressed.\" Lucy broke the silence that could have beennsliced with a knife. \"Karalinda. Her name isnKaralinda. But we call her Kali. \" Kara explained. \"What a sweet name.\" Lucynresponded. \"Has anybody seen Ethan?\"nLinda asked. The sound of a car door opening andnthen closing reached her super hearing. She did not need her x-raynvision to know who it was. Ethan had left the premises without evennwelcoming the guests or his daughter to their home. **** Lucila had walked around to the backnof the house after nobody answered the doorbell after 4 rings. Shensaw the party ongoing and realized that something important must havenhappened in the life Linda aka Supergil. Whatever it was, she needednto be in on it. Taking a deep breath, she knocked on the wooden gatenand caught the attention of Linda. \"Ms. Leighton, what a pleasantnsurprise.\" Linda remarked as she unlatched the gate to let hernteacher in. \"What brings you over?\" \"I wanted to deliver the newsnpersonally. Your short story is a finalist in the competition.\"nHer eye was suddenly caught by the precocious little girl who wasnbouncing off Clark Kent's lap and laughing heartily at the game. Shencould not have been more than a year old and yet the child seemed tonbe far advanced in physical development for her age. \"My daughter.\" Lindanexplained as she led the way to the picnic table where the food andndrinks were placed. \"The reason why your cousin saidnyou will need time off this semester?\" \"If it would be possible, Inwould like to take home the lessons and turn it in for a grade on thendeadline. My child, she is at that stage...\" \"Say no more. \" Lucila cutnin. \"I have always admired mother's who try to do it all forntheir child. Have you given any thought to a nanny for her?\" \"Her name is Kali and no, Inthought I could try and do it all myself for a time.\" \"Interesting name. Tell younwhat, I will let you have all the time you need to complete yournclass requirements. Would you consider using a nanny I recommend?nJust so you can still go to school on the days when you absolutelynhave to. \" \"I could definitely use one.\"nshe replied appreciatively. \"I will send her over tomorrownthen. She is between jobs now and this would be a blessing for her. \" **** She had an extra bounce in her stepnwhen she returned to the carnival. She never thought it would be thisneasy to gain the confidence and trust of Linda. Now, they were in andncoudl finally plot how to exact vengance upon her. Bianca opened the door for her. \"Ingot you into the Logan household. The rest is up to you.\"[Chapter 7] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

He had just witnessed his daughter age a full year before his very eyes. He smiled as he remembered how much Kali looked like her mother. Even her hazelnut hair color was a sure sign he would have a blonde haired daughter in the future. He was sure that the color would lighten even further as she grew. Maybe he was wrong to have walked out on them. Maybe he should have given his daughter a chance. She could not be all Kryptonian right? Somehow, there should be a part of her which was still his to claim, a human part. Maybe... maybe... He pulled into Sal's Joint and ordered a draft. this place held a lot of memories for him. This bar had been rebuilt from the ruins of the runaway tractor that had attacked Ethan all those years ago when he was under Selena's love spell. It was the place he always returned to after Kara had left him to go back to Argo City. Now it looked like a typical restaurant bar that served pretty decent fast food. It was basically the cheapest place to have a drink or meal in Midvale. This was just the place he needed to be at right now. He needed to think about everything that just happened. Just as Linda was not ready to be a mother, he had no idea about how to be a father. Being a father to a human baby was one thing, a Kryptonian child on the other hand, was way over his head. Maybe he could think better here. With a cold glass of beer in one hand and a smoke in the other. Joel and Vicki walked into the bar while he was drinking his fourth mug for the night. Most of the people in the area went there because they could have a beer and a meal at the same time. Ethan was not a regular there as far as they knew. He was always in a hurry to get home to his wife. \"We missed you at the office today Ethan. You did not even call in. Luckily we had a slow day and Vicki and I were able to field the calls and inquiries...\" he began as he took a seat next to Ethan at the bar. Vicki had already taken a table for 3 in case he decided to join them. \"Thanks for doing that. Linda and I had something important to attend to. I did not have the time to make arrangements. Anyway, I don't think the business will implode if I leave it unattended for a day or so.\" Ethan explained. His tone of voice told Joel that he wanted to be left alone. \"Is there a problem Ethan? You looked troubled. Anything we can do to help?\" \"No. I am just celebrating. I'll have another one.\" Ethan lifted his draft mug towards the bartender for a refill. \"Well don't celebrate alone. If you are celebrating. Nobody should drink alone boss.\" Joel led him to the table where Vicki sat patiently waiting for them to join her. **** Lucila was hunched over the kitchen table working on a mix of roots and herbs. If she was to successfully get Bianca into the house of Linda, she would need to be able to disguise herself for hours at a time and have full use of her arms and legs. She needed Bianca to be seen as a normal person. She hoped that the spell she found in her mother's Book of Shadows would do the trick. It sounded like a simple enough incantation but in Bianca's severely weakened state, she wondered if her mother's former apprentice could somehow muster the energy to make it work. \"You just work on getting the potion right and let me worry about the energy to make it work.\" she was told as they shared a simple dinner of chicken and mashed potatoes. They both had a lot riding on Bianca successfully getting into the Logan household. Selena had mentioned her doubts in her journal about how she believed that Linda and Kara from Argo City were one and the same woman. By having her under constant surveillance, Lucila hoped to prove her mother right or wrong and get her revenge accordingly. Kara would pay with her life for what she did to Selena. The potion was finally ready. She transferred one dose into a shot glass and made Bianca drink it. \"If this works, we are on easy street.\" It was difficult for her to drink the greenish goo that smelled like a combination of moldy old socks and a wet dog. Pinching her nose, Bianca opened her mouth and drank it all up in one gulp. \"Where's the spell?\" she asked. She had only one minute to say the spell to make the potion effective. Otherwise, she would just throw up. Lucila held up the paper to Bianca's face and listened as Bianca recited the incantation. \" Witches great and witches wise, shield me now from watchful eyes, let them look and let them see, the image of that I wish to be! \" In a matter of seconds, Bianca was transformed into a petit red head of eighteen years. Gone were the battle scars from her fall, her hunch back disappeared and in its place was the sexy figure of a college freshman. The image of Bianca from her younger years was now magickally restored to its full glory. There were absolutely no traces of the almost beaten Bianca from a few moments ago. \"Wonderful! Your talent for spells and potions is comparable to your mothers. \" Bianca complimented Lucila as she admired her new incarnation in the full length mirror standing in the corner of the kitchen. Lucila beamed with pride. To her, the highest compliment she could ever receive in life was to be told how much like her mother she was. \"I'll whip up a larger batch so you can carry it in a flask with you tomorrow. I have no idea how long the spells I create will last.\" she responded, turning once again to the potion pot. \"Just listen to my instructions. Your mother taught me the art of almost permanent spell casting. Now, I am going to pass it on to you.\" ***** \"Where is your husband Kara?\" Kal-El wondered as Jimmy began setting up the photo area in the living room. Kali had just learned how to super run and kept her mother quite busy chasing after her. Right now, Kara was trying to feed the child some baby food. Most if which was ending up on her shirt. \"I don't know Kal-El. He left without a word after we got back. I think he is mad at me for some reason.\" \"Why? Did something happen at the island that you forgot to tell me?\" \"My parents spoke to us. About the way Kali will develp faster than the other kids here.\" She looked sadly at her daughter who was struggling to get out of the high chair that Kara had tied her into. Luckily, she did not have super strength yet and the towel binding held her in place. Kal-El smiled as he remembered how suprised the Kents were at how fast his physical and mental development was after they had taken him from the wreckage of his transporter pod. So, his niece would undergo the same thing. But Ethan still had no reason to leave Kara without backup. Afterall, Kali was his child as well. \"I remember how my human parents freaked out over the powers I began to display when they found me. I lifted the jeep over my father's head when I was only a little bigger than Kali is now. I think they lived most of their lives afraid of me as a child because of it. But they loved me wholeheartedly just the same. Will this be a problem for Ethan? Do you want me to talk to him?\" he offered. Lois entering the dining room interrupted the cousins talk. \"Time for you and Kali to freshen up Linda. Better give Ethan a heads up as well. Where is he? I haven't seen him since you guys got here.\" \"We'll be ready in 5 minutes!\" Lucy hollered while she helped Jimmy adjust the lighting in the room. Kara looked up helplessly at Kal-El. She wanted to go after her husband and talk to him. Find out what was going on within him and hopefully, help him get over whatever was troubling him. \"I'll bring him home.\" Kal-El squeezed her shoulder lightly as he bent over to reassure her. \"Come with Auntie Lois Kali. Mommy needs to rest and freshen up before the pictures are taken.\" she picked up the little girl and carried her to the playpen, ignoring the fact that her question remained unanswered. Whatever Linda and Ethan were going through, she was sure Clark would tell her about in due time. \"Thank you.\" Linda mouthed to Lois as she motioned that she was going up to take a shower and change into fresh clothes. ***** Everyone at the table decided that Ethan was mumbling nonsense about his marriage producing a super child who aged from a 2 day old child to a year old overnight by simply being exposed to the yellow sun. With his speech beginning to slur and being unable to stand on his own, they wondered as to who could take him home since they all brought their cars with them. \"I can take him.\" Vicki volunteered, snatching his car keys from the table. \"Help me get him to his car.\" \"That won't be necessary.\" a strange male voice instructed. Clark emerged from the smoke filled area of the bar entrance. \"Mr. Kent. Always a pleasure.\" Joel held out his hand for a handshake. \"How many drinks had he had?\" Clark was visibly concerned. \"He's had about 20 's kind of getting to him already. But he looks like he can still have a few more rounds. \" Joel volunteered. What they did not realize was that Clark's concern was more for what his cousin-in-law may have said about Kara and the baby to his companions. He did not think that they would believe his tall tales but he would rather not take any chances. Afterall, everybody knew that Supergirl was real. Where she stayed and who she really was, that was the mystery most people wished to unravel. \"Did he say anything about why he did this?\" \"Yeah. Something about siring a superchild of sorts. Of course we all know that can only happen if he knocked up Supergirl... and that will never even knows how she shows up when she does.\" \"If they only knew.\" Kal-El thought. \"Let's go Ethan.\" \"I am not going home to that freak show.\" Ethan slurred his speech as he spoke. He downed his 16th mug for the night and banged it on the table, a signal for another mug to be served. \"No more drinks for you get us a large coffee, black, to go please? \" Clark told the waitress who came forward to refresh his drink. \"Ethan, don't make me pull you out of that chair.\" there was a warning tone in his voice as he spoke. Ethan was on thin ice with him. Not only was he stupidly telling others their family secret, but he also called Kara and Kali freaks. It took a lot for him not to hurl him across the room with one hand at that point. \"No Kal-El. I am not going with you. Leave me alone! Go back to wherever it is you came from!\" \"What did he call you?\" Vicki asked. She had been silently listening all this time. Trying to figure out Ethan's weakness that she could exploit to her advantage. \"Nothing. It's a family nickname. C'mon Ethan.\" he picked up Ethan by the collar of his shirt and pretended to have a hard time hoisting over his shoulder as they left the bar. **** \"Drink this. There is no way I am taking you home in this state. \" Clark held out the large styrofoam coffee cup to Ethan. He sat Ethan on the hood of the car, hoping to sober him up enough to drive back to his house alone. Otherwise, he would have to fly the car back with Ethan in it. \"I told you, I don't want to go back!\" he pushed the hand away from him. \"Damn it Ethan! Why are you doing this? This is not the way I thought you would be as a family man.\" Clark held back his flaring temper. \"Family? I just found out that I knew nothing about the woman I married, my parents in law are bodiless voices, Kara has an island only she and Kali can get to at any given time, and my child is a freak of science and nature!\" \"Stop it Ethan! Don't say another word. I am warning you. You will regret it!\" Clark warned him, the contempt for the man Kara married was becoming evident in his voice. He would not think twice about putting this man in his place if it became necessary to do so. \"I have no place in this \"family\"! I was used! I was just the babymaker! The sperm donor ! The...\" Without warning and almost unseen due to its speed, Kal-El's fist made contact with Ethan's jaw, sending him flying off the car and into the brick wall of the deserted parking lot. His body fell to the ground with a loud thud. Ethan felt the power of the punch course through his body. He ached all over. His jaw felt like it was going to fall off. \"That is it! I have had it! I am a man too Kal-El! Give me some respect!\" He tried to throw a defensive punch when he finally got to his feet. Kal-El merely caught his fist and forced it down to Ethan's side. \"I don't want to hurt you! You are my cousin's husband! Don't force me to hit you again!\" \"You don't want to hurt me? You don't even respect me as Kara's husband!\" \"Ethan, stop it! You don't know what you are saying!\" Walking drunkenly towards his car, he dropped the keys as he fished it out of his pocket. \"I am going to go home. But only to get my clothes. I can't deal with any of this right now. You people, you Kryptonians, you don't know what it is like, being taken for granted at every turn.\" He closed the door and sped off. Kal-El ran at superspeed while changing clothes. He needed to beat Ethan to the house. He dreaded what would happen next. **** Jimmy had stepped outside for a smoke while waiting for Ethan to get back for the shoot. He crushed the cigarette under his shoe when the familiar car pulled into the driveway. \"Where'd you go buddy?\" he did not notice that Ethan was drunk when he stepped out of the car. \"Don't start Jimmy. Where's Linda?\" he took a few steps towards the patio and fell forward. Jimmy caught him just in time. \"Are you okay?\" Jimmy smelled the beer on his friend immediately. Linda was not going to like this. Ethan began vomiting over Jimmy's shoulder. The acidic smell of beer and semi digested food filled the air. **** \"Just remember Kara, you need to give him space. Let him leave if he wants to. He needs to sort this out on his own. We cannot help him.\" Kal-El had arrived 20 minutes earlier than Ethan and was already talking to Kara in the office when they heard the car pull up. \"But why? What happened? What did I do?\" Kara did not think that things could escalate this far so fast and so badly between them. \"You have done nothing Kara. This is all just too much for an ordinary human being to take in all at once. He will come around. Just be strong.\" Lois advised. Kal-El had asked her and Lucy to join them in order to give Kara a human female perspective on the situation. \"I just don't understand why he could shun us in this manner. This is not his personality at all.\" \"I told you the two of you had rushed into this whole thing way back in high school!\" Lucy reminded her best friend. \"You barely knew him and he did not know you at all.\" \"That's enough Lucy. She feels bad enough as it is.\" Lois scolded her sister. \"What's going on back there?\" Kara stood up and headed to the front door. She picked up on Ethan's wretching with her super hearing. She stopped in the hall where Kali was learning to walk on her own. Surrounded by her hand me down toys, she was holding on to the coffee table as she tried to pull herself up from the floor. Seeing her mother standing at the entrance to the room, the little girl smiled widely and held her arms out as she took baby steps towards her. Kara picked up the child and gave her a kiss. \"No matter what happens Kali, your dad and I do love you.\" **** She helped Ethan up to their room while everyone cleared out for the night. He reeked of beer and cigarettes, two habits which he swore off when she came to become his housemate 5 years ago. What happened since then? Why had their relationship fallen apart in so short a time? They were so happy before, but after she took on more duties as Supergirl, he seemed to become insecure. Now, the arrival of Kali had changed the dynamics of their relationship even more. \"Talk to me Ethan...\" she begged him as he continued to pack his things silently. She sat on the corner of the bed trying to control the mixture of emotions that were running through her heart and mind. \"There is nothing left to say Linda. I just need to get away. I can't be here right now. I cannot handle this. Not yet. I am not ready. I don't want this life right now.\" He did not even bother to stop and look at her as he spoke. \"What makes you think I am ready for this? I did not even know I was pregnant!\" she resented the insinuation that he was the only one taken by suprise by the birth of their child. \"It's different for you. You are her mother. Kali is more Kyrptonian than anything else. I just need to to reconcile everything in my mind and in my heart. That's why I need to leave.\" \"Why can't we do it together? Why can't we go on this journey together? I don't know the first thing about parenting. We should be helping each other.\" her explanation fell on deaf ears. \"You don't need me Kara. You never did. All you ever needed was Kal-El. He is your true family. He knows what to do for you and Kali. I don't belong in your lives.\" his voice cracked as he turned to look at her. She was wiping away her tears as he came over to her. Seeing her in this state melted his heart but his mind was made up. \"Don't cry my Karalinda.\" he tried to pull her closer to him but she shoved him away. \"Don't call me that if you don't mean what you are saying!\" \"I mean it Kara.\" \"Then don't leave me. Don't leave us! We need you!\" All the while, Kali was in the next room, taking a nap in her crib. The little one awoke as her super hearing picked up on the emotions of her mother. Something was wrong. As if sensing the trouble between her parents, Kali found herself floating out of the crib, straight through the open door, and in front of her parents room. \"Mamam? Dadad?\" they heard her little voice on the other side of the door. \"That's Kali.\" she said getting up from the bed. \"Please Ethan, don't go. Not for me. Don't do this to Kali.\" She opened the door and the little girl floated into the room. \"Is she flying???\" Ethan asked in surprise. She was not really flying, she was only a few inches above the floor but Kara did not feel any need to explain to him.  \"What does it matter to you? You won't be here to see how special your daughter will be as she grows up anyway.\" Kara spoke out of hurt. \"Kara, I...\" he closed the suitcase and picked it up off the bed. \"I promise, I will come back. I will come home. I just need time.\" He stopped to kiss his daughter before heading out the door. Kara turned away from him when he tried to kiss her. \"Dadad!\" Kali cried out to her father. There was not much Kara could do to stop the little one from crying. In her innocent little mind, she somehow understood that her father was abandoning them. Was it possible to explain the situation to such a young child? Ethan disappeared out the door and never looked back. Just like that he had chosen to leave their lives. It seemed like a very easy decision for him to make. No amount of Kara's love could make him stay. It led Kara to think, maybe he did not love her afterall? \"Hush little one. Mamam is here for you. I won't ever leave you.\" Kara tried to console Kali by rocking her to sleep.[Chapter 8] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

It was her turn to open the office today and that meant being there an hour before everyone else so that she could tidy up the place and prepare all the daily equipment that the field workers needed. She was surprised to find that the office had been cleaned and the equipment neatly stacked on the open supply shelf. The smell of freshly brewed coffee was coming out of the pantry area. She glanced at her watch. 7 a.m. Who would be in at this hour? They all hated having to open up the office so it could not be any of the regular staffers. \"Whoever you are, I've called the police and they will be here any minute.\" she said making her way towards the pantry to investigate. If all else failed, she would do what everyone in Midvale had been known to do when caught in a dangerous situation, scream \"Help Supergirl!\" at the top of her lungs. \"I warn you, I am armed.\" she lied as she neared the doorway. Ethan walked out of the pantry with a coffee mug in one hand and a sandwich in the other. \"Vicki, you don't even own tear gas.\" he laughed as he set his breakfast down on the breakfast counter. \"Care for some coffee?\" \"What are you doing here so early? Is there a meeting I did not know about?\" she heaved a sigh of relief and set her bag down next to his backpack. \"Going hiking?\" \"None of your business!\" he snapped at her. \"Wow! Take it easy. What's wrong with you? You've been acting really wierd lately.\" she went into the pantry to pour herself a cup of coffee. Ethan knew exactly what was wrong with him. The problem, was that there was nobody he could tell without being hauled off to the looney bin. The only man he could have spoken to, Clark, was the one who caused the bruise. \"Did you get into a fight?\" she was staring at the knuckle prints that were clearly visible on the right side of his jaw. \"That looks really nasty.\" \"I think so. I don't remember... I think I was drunk.\" he lied. She took his empty plate and mug along with hers to the sink. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw him yawn. Now that she had a chance to really look at him, he looked worn out and, obviously, had not gotten a decent nights rest either. \"Why don't you go stretch out in your office while I tidy up? You look like you need it.\" she washed the cups as she spoke. \"I think I will.\" he stretched out his arms before getting up from his seat. **** Linda stirred in bed as she heard Kali's baby talk noises piercing her consciousness. What time was it? Was Kali really not going to let her get any sleep? It seemed to her that all she did was run after her hyperactive daughter since they got home. How she wished she had some assistance. If only Ethan had not left. Ethan. The thought of his leaving cut through her very being. How could the miracle of life turn out to be such a dividing event in their lives? This was not how she thought starting a family with him would end up. Had she known that there were even a possiblity of her getting pregnant... Had she known beforehand that the child would be almost totally Kryptonian... If only Ethan had told her how he really felt about having children with her... She would not have chosen to not bear any child if it meant losing him. \"Mama? Wake mama? Kali gry gry.\" Kali's vocabulary was ever growing. It took only a few hours in front of the TV set watching Sesame Street for her to understand that Mamam was wrong and mama was right. She was obviously a highly intelligent child by earth standards. Kal-El expected her to be speaking in complete sentences by the end of the week at this rate. But there were still some words that escaped her ability to pronounce. Linda's anger at the situation of her family life was such that she was choosing to keep her eyes closed and hoped that she could ignore Kali enough to make her leave her alone. She was angry, angry at her daughter for making Ethan leave. She did not want anything to do with the child. Kali was the reason she was so unhappy now. \"Mama, peayse. Mama wake wake!\" Kali was pushing her now. Their equalized physical strength prevented her from pushing Kara off the bed where she was now sitting beside her mother. Kal-El's voice seemed to be coming from inside the room. \"Kara, wake up. Your daughter needs you.\" \"Unca Clak!\" Kali jumped off the bed towards a surprised Kal-El. \"Unca Clak, wake Mama, Kali gry gry!\" she begged him in childish desperation. \"Okay, okay little one. Go to the kitchen. Mama and I will follow.\" he set her down on the floor and gave her a little pat on the back towards the door. \"No floating Kali!\" ever since the Kali learned how to float the day before, she had been trying to float higher and higher, making Kal-El fear that somebody would see her and blow their cover. \"Unca Clak no float Kali. Kali walk, walk.\" he followed her with his x-ray vision as she disappear down the steps. She sat on every step and lowered herself unto the next one in order to reach the stepboards. \"Good girl Kali.\" Linda still lay on the bed motionless. She did not want to talk to anybody. Most specially Kal-El. He signified what was wrong with her life now. That she was not human and would never be. \"Get up Kara. We have to talk.\" he pulled the covers off her. \"I don't want to talk to anybody Kal-El. I just want to be alone.\" she pulled the covers back. \"You are not going to wallow in self pity Kara! I will not let you!\" He wondered if this was the equivalent of Kyrptonian post partum depression. \"I am not wallowing!\" \"Then get out of bed and take care of your daughter!\" She kicked the covers off angrily and sat up in bed. \"I don't want to! I lost Ethan because of her! I am lost without him! I don't know what to do. How do you raise a child?\" \"Listen to yourself and tell me you are not wallowing.\" he sat on the corner of the bed. \"Kal-El... I...\" He cut her off. \"How can you be so selfish? What happened to you Kara? When did Ethan become your whole world? Don't deny Kali a mother just because Ethan doesn't know how to be a father.\" She began to sob uncontrollably. \" Help me Kal-El.\" He pulled her close and hugged her tightly. \"Let it our Kara. Cry as much as you want. But after this, you need to get your act together. Kali can't raise herself. I promise you, you won't have to do this alone.\" The doorbell sounded just then. \"Mama, door. Kali open?\" \"No! No Kali! Mama is coming!\" she wiped her tears away and smiled at Kal-El. \"We'll be alright.\" **** \"Linda Lee Logan?\" A red headed young woman of no more than 18 asked when the door opened. \"Yes...\" \"Aneles Vinzenzo. Prof. Leighton sent me. The babysitter?\" she explained as Linda stood there with a questioning look on her face. \"Oh right. Come on in.\" she led the way into the kitchen where Kali was safely ensconsed in her uncle's arms, the only way they both knew to keep her from displaying any powers in public at this point. \"This is my cousin, Clark Kent.\" \"Oh yes! I've read your work. You and that Lois Lane make a good writing team.\" Aneles shook his outstretched hand. Linda found herself staring intently at Aneles. She reminded her of somebody. Somebody dangerous. A sense of foreboding seemed to overcome her whole being. She tried to shake it off. \"Is something wrong?\" Aneles asked when she noticed Linda. \"No... no... it's just that... you remind me of someone.\" She smiled at Aneles and offered her some orange juice. \"I guess this little girl will be my ward?\" Aneles motioned towards Kali who was following her every movement silently. As she saw more and more of the dual personalities unfolding before her, she began to register fear in her little round blue eyes. Somehow, both Clark and Linda failed to see what was happening before their eyes. \"Yes, this is Kali. Say hello to Aneles Kali.\" Linda instructed. Kali was not sure about how to react with this woman. Why were her mother and uncle being so nice to this creature? While everyone else saw a young woman, Kali's innocence showed her what it was that she was trying to hide. The broken body of Bianca. \"Hello Kali.\" the woman came over to her and tried to touch her. Kali burst out into tears out of fear. \"Mama! Mama! Faid mama! Munstay! Munstay!\" Linda took Kali from Clark to calm her down. \"It's alright Kali. Mama is here. No... no... there is no monster. Mama won't let any monster hurt you.\" \"See what I mean Linda?\" Clark whispered to her. \"Aneles, let's go to the living room and get the interview started.\" **** \"Linda! Look at the time, you can't be late again! We've got mid-terms today!\" Lucy tried to hurry her friend with whom she had breakfast that day so that they could carpool to school. \"I'm trying to get everything fixed before I go. Why isn't Aneles here yet? I told her about my mid terms.\" Linda muttered under her breath as she sped around following Kali around the house, picking up and replacing the things she was hurling to the floor in glee. How could Linda teach her that throwing things was not a game? How she wished Alura were still alive, that way she would have a mother who could guide and instruct her in the ways of motherhood. Kali seemed to enjoy having her mother constantly chasing after her. Having just learned how to float higher than just a few inches above the floor, then hurl whatever she got her hands on towards the floor. Had Linda not been quick in using her super powers, the house would have been a total wreck by now. \"Can't you control her!\" Lucy screamed as the flower vase that was on the 3rd row of the kitchen brickabrack shelf was hurled mere inches above her head. She had ducked away just in time. Linda was a blur in Lucy's eyes as she sped off to catch the vase before it hit the wall. \"Do I look like I am not trying to control her? Kali! That was bad! We do not hurl things at people!\" Linda finally caught the child in mid float and hugged her close to make her stop. \"Mama, ouch!\" Kali squirmed as Linda forgot her own strength and fell into Kara mode. \"What if she does that out in public? What if she hurls her baby sitter out the window?\" \"Don't be so overly dramatic. Kali is just a kid. She doesn't know how to do those things.\" \"I still think you are taking a risk leaving her with a stranger. Lois and I were willing to take turns watching her.\" Lucy was seriously concerned for the welfare of Kali. At least around them, the child could be herself without worry. \"Can you get that please?\" Linda motioned for the door when the buzzer sounded. Aneles had arrived on time. Biance was taken by surprise when Lucy opened the door. She was not expecting to see her at this house. She remembered her from the final confrontation at the mountain castle. Seeing Lucy brought back the painful memories of being sucked into the Phantom Zone vortex. The horor of becoming part of the living dead in a place that was neither of earth nor space. She did her best to regain her composure. Hoping that her facial expression did not betray her. \"Mrs. Logan is expecting me. I'm Aneles Vinzenzo. The baby sitter.\" she introduced herself. \"Lucy Lane. Her best friend. We were just getting ready to leave for school. C'mon in. \" she could not help but feel that there was something familiar about this woman. If only she could put her finger on it. \"We're heading out the door. Thanks for being on time Aneles.\" Linda placed Kali into the playpen in the living room and gave her a kiss. \"Mommy will be back in a few hours. \" she assured her when she saw Kali curl her face up, ready to cry again. \"Mama, no go. Kali faid. Munstay!Kali go wi mama! Peayse mama peayse!\" her little body shook as she pointed to Aneles. \"Stop it Kali! Be good. YOu will stay here with Aneles. I won't be gone long.\" she warned her and then turned away. \"Her food is in the fridge and the emergency numbers are on the magnetic board in the kitchen. She'll be okay. She just doesn't know you yet.\" Linda instructed. \"Don't worry Mrs. Logan.\" \"It's Linda.\" \"Okay. Don't worry Linda. Prof. Leighton told me I could call you at her office if it is really necessary.\" she put her shoulder bag down on the coffee table and settled into familiarizing herself with the list Linda handed her. \"No classes today?\" Lucy was suspicious. Aneles was supposed to be a college freshman. \"Oh, I have some personal experience essays to write.\" Aneles explained, pulling out a few writing sheets from her bag. \"We're gonna be late Lucy.\" Linda hurried her friend out the door. \"See you in 4 hours. \" she told Aneles. **** Lucy could not shake the feeling that she had seen Aneles before. There as something eerily familiar about her. It so preoccupied her thoughts that she almost missed the turnoff to the main road heading for the college while driving. \"Bianca! That's Bianca!\" she slammed hard on the brakes.[Chapter 9] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Bianca could not have survived the explosion of the Phantom Zone. Now floor the gas, we've got 15 minutes before the test starts.\" Linda told her friend who almost threw both of them out of the windshield with her sudden brake. \"No, no. Just think about it. Doesn't Aneles remind you of somebody? She could be like Bianca's daughter.\" \"Lucy, we don't have the time...\" \"I am telling you, there is something untrustworthy about that woman. She gives me a bad feeling. It is as if she knows me. You have to watch her like a hawk. \" Lucy released the brakes and set the car into motion again. \"You are being too paranoid. Bianca is dead.\" Linda felt a tug at her heart as she remembered the explosion of Argo City. Here she was 4 years later and she still could not get over the pain of her loss. The existence of Heritage Island was helping her to cope better with the loss of her parents though. At least now she had a place to retreat to when she felt like she needed to be in touch with her roots. Something that, because of the events of the past few days, she felt she would have to do as soon as her exams were over. She would take Kali \"home\" for a visit with her. \"That is what we thought about Selena too, and she almost succeeded in killing you.\" **** Aneles had prepared Kali's morning snack with the hopes of putting her to sleep after so that she could snoop around the house without any distractions. The child was constantly crying and running away from her so that it took all of her strength to not simply zap the child into a statue or something. \"Kali, time to eat.\" she hollered towards the living room where the child had ensconsed herself in her playpen. She did not dare come near because the cries that emanated from Kali were so loud that it forced her to cover her ears. \"No. I won't eat ! Wait for mama.\" Kali protested when Bianca showed up with the feeding tray. She was taken aback by the image of the child before her. Had Kali aged a full year since the time she had arrived at the house? Even her speech pattern had changed. The baby talk seemed to have lessened. This was certainly a strange child. \"Kali, your mama left me in charge of you. So you have to eat when I tell you to eat.\" Aneles tried to reason with the child whose head was now taller than the playpen she sat in. \"I don't like you.\" Kali hurled a building block at Aneles who was unable to avoid the projectile. It landed in the bowl of mashed potatoes which splattered across her chest and face. \"Kali, the goddess of destruction. What a fitting name.\" she muttered under he breath as she set aside the tray on the coffee table. \"Don't be so hard headed Kali. Your mama will be mad at you when she gets home and finds out you have not eaten. \" she cleaned herself up with the table napkin that was on the tray. \"No! Monster! Stay away!\" Aneles was amazed at how such a small child was able to jump out of the playpen and disappear from her sight so fast. Where did she go? Could it be? Could this be a super child? She needed to find proof of this child's history. Could Supergirl and Linda Lee Logan really be the same person? Was Selena right all along? She called after the child as she climbed the stairs. \"Where are you Kali? Be a nice little girl and don't give Aneles a hard time.\" She heard the small, afraid voice of the little girl coming out of one of the rooms. She found that the door was locked when she tried the knob. \"Open the door for Aneles Kali. It's okay if you don't want to eat. We can just play a game.\" Aneles tried to coax the child. In truth she preferred that Kali lock herself out of the way so that she would have the freedom to search the house without having to worry about her getting in the way or discovering what she was doing. \"No! Kali will only come out when mama gets home! You bad! You have 2 faces! Monster! Monster!\" \"What do you mean I have 2 faces?\" she tried to peek into the keyhole to see what the child was up to. Admittedly, if anything happened to the child under her watch, it would ruin all the plans she and Lucila had carefully drawn up. \"Go away! Mama! Daddy! Help me!\" Kali started hitting her head against the wall that she sat up against. \"Stop it Kali! Stop it!\" Aneles decided it was time to open the door whether the child wanted it or not. \" Powers that control the portal to all worlds, Powers that have the ability to unlock the arc of the covenant, Unlock this door before the child within comes to injury.\" With that chant, the door she stood before opened up to reveal the child standing on the ledge of bedroom window. \"Kali don't!\" she froze in horror as the child dangled her foot off the ledge where she stood. She wasn't going to really make that jump was she? As if challenging Aneles, Kali stepped off the ledge and floated in mid - air. \"A Super child!\" Aneles was sure of it now. But who was her mother? Linda or Supergirl? And the father? Superman? Kali glanced towards the driveway as she heard the hum of a car driving up towards the house. She saw her father's car pull up the driveway. She smiled at the thought of her father coming home to protect her. In her mind, she believed that he had heard her calling for him. She had no idea that Ethan was not like her and her mom. This was just a coincidence. \"Daddy!\" she cried out in joy as she floated down to the window sill. \"Daddy?\" Aneles was getting more confused by the minute. The child's father was not Superman then?her father was an earthling? But the strength and self confidence that the child was displaying... **** He had just stepped into the hallway when he heard Kali calling out from the top of the stairs. He turned just in time to see her take off from the topmost step of the stairs. He dropped his keys and lunged towards her. Completely forgetting that it would take more than a fall from the stairs to hurt his daughter. Kali had not learned how to fly yet so that when she jumped off the step, she lost control and spiralled wildly downward towards her father. \"Kali!\" he shouted as she landed squarely on his stomach where he had fallen in the hopes of breaking her fall. \"Ooomph!\" he felt the wind get taken out him by the pressure of her body leaning on his own. \"Daddy! Home! Daddy come home!\" she wrapped her little arms as tightly as she could around his neck and refused to let go. \"Kali, Kali, where is mommy?\" he asked her as he tried to untangle her arms from his neck so he could stand up. \"Mommy at school. Home soon.\" \"Who is with you Kali? Clark? Lois? Jimmy? Lucy?\" he called out as he took her hand and led her to the living room. He saw the uneaten food and wondered who had prepared it. Why was there a building block in the bowl? \"Mr. Logan?\" Aneles showed herself. She stood at the top of the stairs where she had watched the events unfold. Seeing how Kali flew wildly through the air only convinced her further that Supergirl was somewhere in that house. \"Who are you?\" he asked while Kali clung to him in fright at the sight of Aneles. \"I'm the baby sitter. Aneles Vinzenzo.I started today.\" \"Oh right. Linda told me about you.\" he lied. He decided it was not Aneles' business to know that he and Linda had not spoken for days and he was only there to pick up some fresh clothes. He would have to play along and pretend to know what Linda had been up to with regards to Kali all this time. \"I was expecting Linda to be home by now.\" she explained. \"She should be here soon. I just came by to pick up some things I need at the office. Don't bother telling her about my coming home will you?\" he was not yet ready to talk to Linda. He still did not know what he wanted from her or what to expect of this situation. Until he sorted things out for himself, it would be best for them to not see each other. \"Daddy, monster.\" Kali pointed to Aneles once again. Hoping that he could see what she was seeing. He did not. \"That is not a nice thing to say about Aneles Kali.\" he bent down to pick her up and was surprised to discover that, even though she had gained height and weight, she was still light enough for him to pick up. He wondered how much longer she would keep her human traits before he lost her forever to a heritage he did not understand. \"No daddy, look! Please daddy!\" she was pointing to the mirror now that was behind Aneles at the top of the stairs. Had Ethan not been so busy humoring his daughter he would have seen the gray cloaked burned woman who hunched over as she stood before them. Kali rubbed her eyes and yawned. She was so tired from running away from Aneles all morning. She wanted to sleep. But she somehow knew that she would not be safe if she went to sleep. \"C'mon little one.\" Ethan carried her up to her room. \"Go have a snack. I'll put her to bed.\" he instructed Aneles as he closed the door on her. \"Daddy, don't go away. Daddy stay with me? Mommy home soon. \" Kali was begging her father as he tucked her in. \"Daddy will stay till you fall asleep.\" he turned on the cassette player on the bookshelf and played a tape of nursery rhymes to help her fall asleep. He sat by her bed and stroked her arm till she dozed off. She looked so peaceful as she slept. He wanted nothing more than to dote on her. But he was held back by his inhibitions about who she really was. Was there any part of her that he could actually say belonged to him? He closed his eyes and imagined what kind of father he would be if Kali had become a normal human child instead of a half breed. What a perfect family they could have been. He kissed the top of her head before heading out towards the master's bedroom. He took a long shower and packed another overnight bag full of clothes and other things he would be needing while he lived out of his office. His eyes fell upon the silver photo frame that held their wedding picture. He could not help but smile as he remembered the day that Linda became all his. The day that she chose to live as a human being. He took the frame and tossed it into his bag. **** Linda sat staring at her exam paper. She had finished the test in 10 minutes but had to wait for Lucy to finish before she could turn hers in. Linda was worried about all the cries that she had been hearing coming from Kali. She simply refused to allow Aneles to get near her. Maybe it was too soon for her to be returning to school. Maybe she should have stayed home a full month. Or at least until Kali became comfortable around strangers. Things would have been easier if Ethan had been around to do his part. She tuned her hearing towards the range of Kali's voice while waiting. She could hear her breathing evenly. \"Aneles got her to take a morning must be very tired.\" she thought with a smile. Lucy got up and signalled Linda to turn her paper in. They joined the other Creative Writing students in turning in their work to the teaching aide. Prof. Leighton did not come to adminster the exam to them. She had called in sick and allowed her teaching aid to supervise the procedure instead. \"How's Kali doing?\" Lucy asked worriedly as they made their way to the parking lot. \"She seems to be sleeping right now.\" Linda replied as she strapped herself into the seat. \"We best get home then. I sure hope she did not freak out Aneles.\" Lucy still did not believe Aneles was on the level but if Linda trusted the woman, she would have to go along with it and hope Linda was right. **** Kali's super hearing alerted her to her father stepping out of the front door. Not wanting to be left alone with the being that she feared so much, the little girl got out of bed, locked the door to her room and opened the window. She stepped out and floated onto the top of Ethan's car just as he passed her window. Nobody noticed that she lay on the roof of the car as it passed the busy intersections of Midvale. The yellow sun continuing to increase her powers and rapidly age her. Making her taller by nches in a matter of seconds before stopping. Now, Kali looked like a 3 year old child. She had fallen asleep again by the time Ethan pulled into his office lot. **** Aneles heard Ethan leave the house. Confident that the child would not be wandering out of her room at least until her mother got home, she began searching the rooms of the house for evidence of Supergirl's existence. She could not find anything to link the two women and the child within the rooms she had searched so far. She felt anger rising up inside of her. The identity of Supergirl needed to be uncovered. She owed it to Lucila to bring her mother's killer to justice. But where would she find the evidence she needed? Taking a chance, she entered the master's bedroom. Everything in the room looked like normal everyday items. Nothing out of the ordinary. She went through the drawers, careful to replace everything just as she found it so as not to arouse suspicion. Even the clothes cabinet was unremarkable. It was only by accident that she happened to grab onto the clothes rack when she lost her balance. Her weight pulled open the secret room behind the wall. The fake wall held the answer to the secret that she had been looking for all along. Beyond the wall was another room that was only slightly smaller than the master's bedroom in size. Within the walls lay all the items that could directly link Supergirl to Linda Lee Logan. Everything was here. From the numerous sets of Supergirl uniforms to the old Midvale School for Girls uniform of Linda. The various pictures of Linda Lee as a student at Midvale School and then in various states of undress as she changed into the Supergirl costume. Photos that were taken during playful moments with Ethan when he was trying to make her stay home instead of going off to save the day with Kal-El or on her own. Pictures that, if the world ever saw, would remove the anonymity of Kara forever. These were more than enough to prove that Selena was right. Linda and Supergirl were indeed one and the same person. Taking a foldable film camera out of her back pocket, she took as many pictures of the room as she could. Lucila would be very interested to learn of her mother's vindication. Now, they could plot how to destroy Supergirl and her child once and for all. **** \"Kali baby, mommy's home.\" Linda said loudly as she and Lucy walked into the house. When she did not hear Kali's voice respond, she started up to the nursery to check on the child. \"Aneles? Where are you?\" she looked at Lucy with a worried look on her face. \"I'll check the kitchen.\" Lucy could only hope to find Aneles with Kali there. Having heard the women arrive, Bianca had used magic to transport herself from the secret room to the kitchen where she was now feigning sleep as she slumped over the breakfast nook. \"Aneles, Aneles? Wake up.\" Lucy nudged her lightly. \"Hummm...? Oh Lucy. I must have dozed off.\" \"Where's Kali?\" \"In her room. Mr. Logan was here earlier and he told me he would put her to bed for me. She clung to him the minute he walked into the door.\" \"Lucy!\" Linda's voice was in sheer panic coming from the nursery. She broke into a sprint up the stairs. \"Please god don't let it be!\" she prayed. \"Kali's gone!\" Linda exclaimed as Lucy appeared at the door. **** Vicki walked into Ethan's office just as he was unpacking his overnight bag. She had the laundry that he had asked her to do for him. \"Is there anything else I can do for you?\" she placed the laundry bag on the couch and opened it up. She took his folded shirts out and lay it in one of the filing cabinet drawers that she had emptied out for him. \"Maybe some lunch? I haven't had time to grab a snack all morning. I was at the house.\" he took out the wedding picture and placed it on his desk. She felt a tinge of jealousy upon seeing the picture. But she was confident in the knowledge that his marriage was in trouble . Ethan never said a word but all the signs were there for her to see. She would have to be a fool to not take advantage of it. \"Any particular requests?\" \"Just something to tide me over. Maybe a BLT?\" \"Coming right up.\" **** \"Don't panic Linda. I'll get Clark to come over.\" Lucy tried to calm down her panic stricken friend. \"No, no. Don't tell Clark. This is something I have to deal with on my own.\" Aneles came into the room to find out what had happened. She had been so busy in the secret room that watching Kali completely slipped her mind. \"Where were you? How could you let this happen?\" Linda tried to control her anger from surfacing. She had entrusted her daughter to this woman. \"Mr. Logan told me to go have a snack and relax...\" she began to explain. \"Mr. Logan? Ethan was here?\" The thought that Ethan chose to come to the house when Linda would not be around added to the hurt and worry that she was already feeling. \"He told me not to tell you but under the circumstances...\" \"Go home Aneles. I'll call for you if I need your services.\" Linda signaled Lucy to see her out of the house. It was only then that she noticed the open window in the room. Using her x-ray vision, she saw the imprints of Kali's shoes on the ledge. She could almost guess what had happened and where her daughter was. \"Lucy, stay here till I get back.\" Linda got up on the window sill as well. \"Where are you going?\" \"I know where Kali is.\" she jumped off and flew upward in the direction of Ethan's office. **** Ethan flexed his shoulders as he ate his lunch. Vicki had drawn the blinds in the office so that he could wear more comfortable clothes while he ate. \"How about a massage?\" she offered. \"I'd love one. Linda has been too busy lately to give me one.\" he appreciated her gesture. She came over to him and began massaging him through his shirt. He smelled of Spring Fresh soap. His scent filled her senses so that she could not properly massage his shoulders with his shirt on. \"I can't reach the knots in your shoulder blades.\" she told Ethan who was now lying on his chest on the couch. Without even thinking, Ethan whipped his shirt off and threw it towards his desk. His rippling muscles were now exposed for Vicki to see and enjoy touching. She felt herself feeling hotter than ever as she continued to massage his shoulders and back. He was enjoying the massage too much to ask her to stop. It had been months since Linda had any real time to take care of his physical needs. Their anniversary night was more of an exception that a norm. \"Ethan?\" she called out his name softly. He rolled over and reached up to Vicki's face for a soft and tender kiss. She returned his kiss with an unexpected passion. He was unsure as to whether to push her away or just enjoy the moment. It did not take long for him to simply go with his emotions of the moment. Just as things were beginning to get serious between them, Linda burst into the office. \"No Ethan! Stop it!\" she screamed in anger and pain. How could he do this to her? How easily he cheated on her. He thought nothing of making love to another woman just to spite her. He pushed Vicki off of him and grabbed his shirt. \"Linda! It's not what you think!\" Vicki straightened her clothes out as she left the room. She smiled as she thought about how close she had been to getting what she wanted from Ethan. There would be another chance. She would make sure of it. \"What the hell Vicki?\" Joel asked her when he saw her coming out of the room. \"He's a married man.\" \"An unhappily married man Joel. Unhappily married.\" **** \"Linda I...\" \"Don't. Don't talk Ethan. Don't say anything at this point. Please. I beg you. Don't hurt me any more than you already have.\" she tried to control her emotions as she spoke. \"You're the only one Linda.\" \"Then what were you doing with your secretary!\" The power of her fists slamming into his table broke it in half. \"Look at what you made me do!\" \"Linda...\" She held her hand up to stop him from speaking. Turning away from him, she saw his employees haggling for a position between the slots of the venetian blinds. She drew up the blinds mostly to help her control her temper than anything else. \"It was just a massage Linda.\" \"Since when did a massage include lip service from a woman who isn't your wife Ethan?\" \"Linda.. it's been so long since you took care of me.\" \"What do you mean? What more do I have to do for you? I can't understand you anymore Ethan!\" He approached her with the intention of hugging her to calm her down. \"Don't touch me. Don't make me hurl you at the wall in front of your employees.\" she warned him. \"That! That is what I want to see! Get mad Linda! Let me see how human you are!Get mad at me! At least if you are mad at me I can feel that you still love me! That I am still a part of your life! No pretenses!\" \"I never pretended to be anything with you Ethan! I am human!I I love you! You are the only one I ever loved! I risked my life to have your child!\" \"No you're not! You've changed Linda! You are no longer the woman I married! All I ever wanted was you! You were enough for me. I did not need anything else. But you never gave yourself fully over to me! I will always own only half of you, just like I my child will forever be only a half human!\" he cried out. \"You've changed Ethan! When did you start hating who I really am? Kali is not a half breed either. She is our daughter. She is a part of me and a part of you. Regardless of her abilities. We have a very special child Ethan. Love her, love me, love us!\" He was struck by her words. He did not hate who she really was. He loved her no matter who she was. She was his Karalinda. The love of his life. His soul-mate. The other half of his being. Kali was his own flesh and blood as well. But why couldn't he accept her as half Kyrptonian? What was wrong with him? What was happening to them? \"We need to work this out Linda. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to break up this family.\" his voice cracked as he spoke. \"I don't want to lose you either Ethan. But we don't have the time to sort this out now. Kali is missing.\" \"What?\" \"Aneles said that you tucked her in for a nap this morning.\" \"I did. Before I left. She did not want to let me go. She kept saying something about Aneles being a monster. I had to calm her down first.\" he explained. \"Well she disappeared soon after. I was hoping she was with you.\" \"No. I would have known if she had snuck into the car.\" \"Not unless she floated or flew after you.\" she reminded him. \"Oh right. My daughter isn't an ordinary child.\" Linda thought she detected sarcasm in his voice but chose to ignore it. **** Kali awoke upon picking up on her parents voices coming from the building in front of the car. Slowly climbing down, she made her way into the office building. \"Mommy, daddy?\" she asked every person whom she passed in the room. Everyone was too busy to notice her. Everyone except Joel who was running copies of a landscaping job specs on the copying machine when she wandered into the copy room. \"Well hello there. Whose kid are you?\" he asked her. **** A knock on the door interrupted their discussion. Joel poked his head through the door. \"Sorry to disturb you guys but there is a kid wandering the office halls....\" he began. \"Mommy? Daddy?\" \"Kali!\" her parents jumped at the sound of her voice. They rushed towards her in relief. Linda picked up her daughter and hugged her tightly. \"Don't scare mommy that way ever again Kali.\" \"Mommy, monster. Daddy went away. Left me with the monster. I followed daddy.\" she smiled triumphantly at her mother. Kali was proud of her accomplishment without realizing the dangers she had exposed herself to because of it. The recklessness of a child. Linda would need to have a serious talk with her when they got home. Linda looked at Ethan with sadness in her eyes. Was it really too late for them? Could he really hate his flesh and blood so much that he could not spend a few hours with her when she was afraid? \"Mommy and daddy?\" Joel sounded confused. \"She's our daughter Joel.\" Ethan explained. \"That is all you need to know.\" He closed the door in Joel's face. \"Daddy's here Kali. I am here for you.\" He took her from her mother and hugged her tightly. \"Don't make promises you can't keep Ethan.\" Linda warned him.[Chapter 10] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Plans Set In Motion Lucila sat at the dining table with the pictures that Bianca had taken of the secret room spread out before her. This was all the proof that she needed to be sure that her mother was right. Linda Lee Logan and Kara, daughter of Alura and Zor-El were one and the same woman... the woman who killed her mother. \"Tell me Bianca, what would mother have done in this situation? What spirits would she have called upon to destroy Kara?\" she picked up one of the pictures and crumpled it into a lump. \"I can tell you what won't work. Kara is a powerful alien. She can withstand even the strongest Shadow Monster. There is no magick that has been created which can weaken her or drive her to madness. From what I learned from the evil entities in the Phantom Zone, there is but one way to beat the members of the House Of El.\" Bianca was already walking towards the area of the room where there was a lose floor board. She took out a heavy steel container box from it. Lucila stood up and helped her hoist the heavy box into the table. \"This is the Coffer of Shadow. It is the only container on this planet that could contain the Omegahedron. The most powerful magickal ball to ever exist. Your mother was its master for a while. Until Kara came and ruined everything.\" \"What's inside it now?\" Bianca took a cloverleaf shaped key from underneath the box and unlocked it. The strong green glow of Kyrptonite blinded them almost immediately. \"This is the the one element in all the galaxies that can kill both Kara and her daughter. All it takes is just one small stone for each of them to end their lives.\" she placed the glowing stones in Lucila's hands. **** Ethan watched from his office window as Linda and Kali left the premises. He knew that Linda had flown to his office and wanted to see how she planned to get home with the little girl who was bursting with excess energy as she hopped and skipped alongside her mother. They looked so normal from afar. A young mother and her child making their way through the city. Nobody would have guessed that these two beings were special. One was destined to protect Midvale and the other, born to continue the legacy of her mother and uncle when the proper time came. Was he really willing to ask Linda to sacrifice her duty for his sake? Was he being selfish because he entertained the thoughts of wanting to have a normal family life with her and their daughter? From the stories Kal-El had told in the past, it would be very possible for him to have what he wanted. All it would take was a visit to a special chamber in the Fortress of Solitude. \"Ethan? Have you got a minute?\" Joel's entry disturbed his thoughts. \"Yeah, yeah. What do you need?\" he turned from the window and signaled for Joel to sit down in the guest chair. \"If you don't mind, this isn't about work.\" he began. \"Then what is it?\" Ethan took his own seat and set aside some papers in front of him so he could place his arms on the table. \"It's about Vicki.\" \"What about her?\" \"I like her Ethan. But I won't have a chance unless you stop leading her on.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I am talking about your wife walking in on you and Vicki. What the hell Ethan? Isn't Linda enough for you? Isn't she a good wife? Why are you putting your family on the line this way? And with that daughter of yours, we never even knew Linda was pregnant. Don't ruin it Ethan. Not over Vicki. She isn't worth it for you.\" Ethan sat there listening to his friend as he held the mirror up for him to see his faults. But it wasn't all his fault. Linda had lost time for him, she produced a child whom he could not relate to, this was all her fault. \"Joel, you don't understand my marriage. It isn't a normal marriage. Not by human standards. Linda is... she's special. She does some things which I can't understand. Our daughter is something else entirely. And don't even get me started on the pregnancy.\" his thoughts drifted back to that night Kara went into labor, when he had almost lost her. \"And Vicki? What is she to you? A hole you can plug into?\" Joel's tone was becoming argumentative. \"She was a moment of weakness. I don't love her in the way you are thinking Joel, I swear upon my daughter's life. I love my wife.\" \"Then go home to her man. Stop with the floor leader act. Work it out.\" \"How do you work out the fact that my wife is an alien and my daughter is a half breed?\" he thought silently. \"You're a very lucky guy Ethan. Linda is a treasure. Everybody likes her and that isn't because she is the boss' wife either. She is endearing.A friend to everyone. Never has a chip on her shoulder... very likeable person. You are a fool to even consider fooling around with a wife like that. \" Joel added. \"Listen man, let me figure out my marital problems my way. In the meantime, go and chase after Vicki. I don't want her. I don't love her.\" he assured his friend as he got up from his chair. He walked over to the framed wedding picture that sat on the coffee table in the middle of the office. \"I'll hold you to that Ethan.\" Joel got up himself and headed for the door. He picked up the picture and stared at their ecstatic faces. They were so happy that day. Everything was perfect. Things could be perfect for them again. Linda never asked anything of him. But he always asked of her and she always gave what she could without question or pause. Would she be willing to make the supreme sacrifice if he asked her? Did she love him that much? As far as Ethan was concerned, it was the only thing that could save their family. It was worth a shot. \"I've got a family to save.\" he said. **** \"Mommy, let's float.\" Kali asked her mother as they walked the streets that would lead them home. She had been controlling the urge to float since they left the office and it was building up inside of her. Without knowing it, she started to elevate from the ground. \"Kali! No!\" Linda tugged on her daughter to make her touch the ground again. Luckily, nobody had seen Kali's display. It was late afternoon and most of Midvale was asleep. \"Why not mommy?\" she looked at her mother with hurt in her eyes. Why was it that even her Uncle Clark would not let her float? \"Not everybody can float Kali. So it would be best to not let other people know that you can do it.\" she explained as she picked up the pace of their walk. \"But why can't everybody float?\" Kali was beginning to make Linda feel uncomfortable with her questions. \"Just because Kali.\" \"Because what mommy?\" \"Kali, you are too young to understand.\" \"Tell me mommy!\" Kali stomped her feet with such force that the ground they stood on shook with the intensity of a mild earthquake. \"Stop it! We will discuss this at home.\" \"No mommy! Talk now!\" Linda wondered if Kali had inherited her temper from her father. \"Calm down Kali. Nobody is arguing with you.\" \"Mommy!\" Kali jumped into the air and awkwardly began to fly. \"Mommy! Help! What's happening?\" \"Kali!\" With quick glance around, Kara confirmed that nobody was in that part of the city at this dead hour. The sun was beating down on them and anybody out at the height of this Midvale summer day was asking for a severe case of heatstroke. With a light jump, she flew after her daughter in the guise of Supergirl. Grabbing onto her daughter's flailing hands and arms, she tried to calm down the panicking child. Kali was clambering into her arms. Afraid of what had just happened to her. Not really understanding anything she was experiencing. Kali felt much different now than a few moments ago. She felt stronger, older, more mature. \"Don't let me go! What 's happening to me? I'm scared mommy!\" she begged as she held on tightly to Kara's neck. Fear struck her even more when she realized that the woman she was holding on to sounded like her mother but looked different from Linda. \"Mommy, what happened to your hair? Your clothes?\" Kali was suprised by the way her speech pattern changed. Her light lisp was gone. \"Calm down Kali. I will explain everything to you. After your flying lesson.\" Kara had just come to the realization that her daughter had rapidly aged yet again. \"I can fly? Can daddy fly too?\" Kara wished that the time for the explanation would never come. But now that she had to do it, she wondered if this meant that there was no longer a chance for her and Ethan to rebuild what they once had. **** \"Kal-El, once again you are going to meddle with the way of the humans. Why do you never listen to me? You must not interfere.\" the calm voice of Jor-El was transmitting across the fortress. \"I will interfere where the happiness of Kara is concerned. I will not allow her to end up divorced. She does not deserve any more sadness in her life father.\" Kal-El continued to work on something that looked like a car engine on his work slab. \"This is dangerous my son. You do not know about the future events that you might change for the worse.\" \"I will be here with Kara to make it right. I am the only one who can help her father. We are the only ones who can understand each other. I was lucky that Lois is more open minded that Ethan.\" he put down what looked like an oil filter wrench next to the motor before picking up a socket wrench. \"But this technology...\" \"Will save my cousin's marriage. Please father. Kara and I know how to best deal with our lives on this planet. We will not do anything to jeopardize our home and the people we love. \" \"I hope so Kal-El. For both your sakes. You have to realize Kal-El, Kryptonian technology in the hands of any human is a highly dangerous thing. These people have an evil streak within them that they cannot seem nor want to control.\" **** \"Vicki, come into my office please.\" Ethan's voice came over the intercom on her desk. She was expecting him to call her back in to finish the business they had started earlier. Her grin made her officemates stare at her in disgust. They all knew she was targeting Ethan. She sat seductively on his desk thinking that he wanted to be seduced. If it was sex that would win him over, then that is what she was going to give him. \"Get off my desk.\" He told her. He stood up and went to the other end of the room. He sat on the sofa facing Linda's high school graduation picture on the corner table. Sitting next to him, she tried to pull him towards her so they could take care of their unfinished business. \"Will you stop it! I am a married man!\" \"That is not what you were saying before your wife interrupted us.\" she tried to sound seductive. \"I love my wife. I do not love you.\" he gave the bad news to her straight. \"You are just saying that.\" she whispered into his ear. He took her arms off from around his neck and pushed her away. \"Clear out your desk and pick up your salary. I can't have you working here anymore.\" he headed for the door and opened it. His message was clear. \"Joel.\" Ethan called out while making sure that she would not get near him again. He had a wondering look on his face when he entered the manager's office. \"Make sure she clears out her desk by the end of the day. She is all yours.\" with that Ethan turned Vicki over to Joel. If he was really in love with her, now was his chance. **** \"Get me the bat's wing skin and bitterroot.\" Bianca instructed Lucila as she stood hunched over the makeshift stove that held the boiling cauldron. \"Anything else?\" Lucila asked as she dropped the ingredients into the pot. \"Pulverize the kryptonite. We are doing this tomorrow. Just make sure to keep Linda and Lucy apart. I need to get Lucy alone for a few hours or nothing we discussed will work.\" she reminded her.[Chapter 11] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

He picked up the office phone and dialed the familiar Metropolis number. The phone rang a few times before a familiar female voice on the other end picked up the call. \"Daily PLanet. Lois Lane speaking.\" she answered absentmindedly as she tried to concentrate on the phone call and Jimmy asking her to choose a photo to headline her news story with. \"Lois, Ethan here. Can I come over? I need your advise.\" he picked up the picture frame on his table that held a studio shot of Linda dressed in her debut gown. \"Sure. What's up? \"There is something I need to discuss with you. It's about Linda.\" he was careful to use Kara's Earth name in case somebody was listening in on their conversation. \"Shouldn't you be talking to Clark then?\" \"This is one problem I need your opinion on. Clark, he wouldn't understand.\" What kind of problem relating to Linda would Clark not understand? Lois hoped that their marital problems were not coming to a head. \"Meet me at Popeye's around 4?\" she suggested while she signed some forms. **** Kali was slowly gaining confidence with her flying abilities as her mother gave her more and more distance with which to hold onto to her. She was now a full 2 arms length from Kara. With her daughter's left hand tightly clasping her own right hand, Kara remembered her own experience flying for the first time. She was an innocent when she first landed on Earth. She did not realize that earthlings were very different from her at first. She clumsily flew out of Midvale Lake and landed in a heap on the shore nearby. It took a while for her to learn to control her flying abilities because Kal-El was not on the planet at the time. She had to learn it all on her own. Crashing into trees headlong and miscalculating her distance from the water so that she almost drowned taught her that flying looked easier than it actually seemed. Her first encounter with the male of the species was not exactly a thought she liked to go back to. She had been forced to hurt them in order to defend herself. These were stories and thoughts that she knew she had to shieild Kali from if she were to learn how to take her duty as the protector of the planet seriously when the time came. Ethan and Lucy were the 2 most important people who helped her settle in on the planet. Lucy was the first person to actually welcome her on Earth. Funny as it sounds now, Lucy sort of mothered her for a very long time. She was her mentor and best friend. She taught Kara everything she knew about life, and relationships. \"Kali, listen to me honey.\" Kara spoke softly. \"I am going to let your hand go. If you feel yourself losing your center, I want you to thrust your arms in front of you. Make a fist to give you something to concentrate on. Keep your arms centered. Do you understand me?\" There was uncertainty in the child's eyes but she trusted her mother to not allow her to get hurt. \"Yes mommy.\" She flailed her arms in front of her the minute she was released from the grasp. Kali could feel herself begin to fall. \"Mommy!\" \"Hold your arms out in front of you! Center yourself Kali!\" Kara ordered as she followed her daughter's path downward, refusing to grab her daughter into her protective arms. \"I can't do it mommy!\" \"Karalinda, listen to mommy. You can do this. Just concentrate. Listen to mommy's voice. Don't be afraid. You were born to fly.\" her mother instincts took over as she tried to soothe Kali's fears away. Without really understanding how she did it, Kali's flying began to straighten out. Her tattered clothes which ripped apart during her growth spurt whistled as the air passed between the holes. \"Mommy, I'm flying!\" \"Yes you are sweetie.\" \"This is so cool! I can't wait to show daddy!\" Kara felt a lump build up in her throat at the mention of Ethan's name. Would he ever get to see Kali fly? Did he hate Kali? Would he ask her for a divorce? \"Mommy, where are we going?\" Kali disturbed her mother's thoughts. \"Oh right. Well, where do you want to go?\" \"Somewhere you can tell me the story of why we can fly.\" Kara immediately knew where to take her. \"Follow me Kali.\" They veered towards the direction of Heritage Island. **** Lois sat intently listenting to what Ethan had to say. She tried not to register her actual feelings on her face as he explained to her what exactly his plans were to save his marriage. She thought about how lucky he was that it was she who was sitting across from him at the table and not Clark. If he ever heard what is cousin in law was saying... \"Wait, are you saying that you want Linda to give up who she really is? You want her to surrender that which makes her special and loved by the world just because you want to have a normal family? Ethan, that is the most selfish thing I have ever heard you say.\" she took a sip from the soda cup before continuing. \"You know very well that there is no way that can happen.\" \"Why not? Clark did it for you at one time. He loved you enough to give up his powers. If Linda really loved me, she would do the same thing.\" he explained as he took a bite out of his fried chicken leg. \"The repercussions were severe. Crime ran rampant, those evil Kyrptonians took over the White House... It was armageddon Ethan. We both know that I would not be sitting here talking to you today if Clark had continued down the path to humanizing his total being. We need Kal-El and Kara just as they are. You have to understand that. There is something bigger at stake here.\" She tried to reason with him. How could she get him to understand that just as she had to learn to share Clark with the world, so would he have to learn to share Linda, and maybe later on, even Kali, with the world? These three beings were not meant for an ordinary human life and they seemed to embrace that duty willingly. Or at least she hoped Kali would embrace the responsibility just like her uncle and mother did. \"See, that is where you are wrong.\" he defended himself. \"You very well know that they can get the powers back anytime they really need to.\" \"It's a one shot deal Ethan. Clark did it only once and he can never do it again. The chamber will allow them to perform each transformation only once. It is not like a costume that they can put on and take off whenever they want.\" \"Then she will just have to choose.\" She could not believe what she was hearing. How could Ethan have become so self centered and unreasonable? \"Do you even hear yourself? Do you have any idea of what you are about to ask of your wife? Ethan, have you ever stopped to consider her feelings? You are going to ask her to cut off her past completely and pretend Kara never existed !\" \"What's wrong with that? We have a family now. She does not need to go flying off at the drop of a hat to save some person she does not even know. I am fed up with worrying about her and always having to take the back seat in her life!\" Exasperated, Lois found herself shaking in disgust. \"Can I have a coffee please?\" she asked the passing waitress. She needed to look away from Ethan for a bit to regroup her thoughts and word what she was about to say very carefully. \"Ethan, when Kal-El and I spent that week at the fortress, I took the time to study, understand, and try to relate to his culture as a Kryptonian. I made the effort to understand where he came from, what and who he was, and who he had to become. Which is why I understand why he can never become totally human. Have you ever tried to do that for Kara?\" He turned his face away from her. \"I never felt a need to.\" \"Then you are the reason the marriage is failing. Who Linda really is has nothing to do with it. You can't ask her to do this Ethan. I know you are better than that. Don't be the selfish jealous husband. Be the man Linda needs you to be right now. She is under enough pressure as it is.\" **** \"Mother? Father, I am here with my daughter.\" Kara awoke the sleeping computer system with her voice. \"Kara, my child. Where is the little one?\" Alura's holographic image appeared before them on the wall screen. \"Mommy, what is this place? Is she a monster like Aneles?\" Kali clung to her mother, afraid of what she was seeing. \"We are on Heritage Island. The place where we can use all our special abilities without having to worry about being seen. Kali, I told you, Aneles is not a monster and no, that woman is not a monster. She is Alura, your grandmother.\" \"And I am Zor-El, your grandfather.\" the holographic image spoke as it too came online. \"Why are you both here my child? he asked. \"Kali has some questions and I do not know how to answer her. I am not prepared to explain such a complicated matter to her. I was hoping that you could help me make sense of everything for her.\" \"We understand. She has developed just as our calculations had predicted. She needs to know about where she came from. It is of vital importance that she be prepared to continue the legacy. Kara, go get the yellow crystal from the shelf behind you. \" Zor-El instructed as a transparent shelf holding crystals of various sizes and colors came out of the wall very slowly. \"Mommy!\" \"Don't worry Kali. This is the safest place where the two of us can ever be.\" Kara returned with the crystal and held it up to the images. \"Insert it in the slot. \" He referred to the round tube that seemed to have come from under the floor. \"Kali, it is time for you to understand what makes you a special being in the world of mortals.\" Alura explained as the lights in the room dimmed and images of Argo City in its prime began to appear on the wall. **** The trophy for the Creative Story Writing winner sat on the shelf where Bianca and Lucila were working on a potion meant to keep Supergirl oblivious to the presence of Kryptonite on the award. Lucila had already been informed that Linda had won the top prize. The award was going to be presented to her as a suprise at the next day's student assembly. \"Get the trophy Lucila. The Kryptonite is ready.\" Bianca instructed as she carefully filled the Coffer of Shadow with the lethal powder. \"Are you sure Supergirl will not know that the trophy has Kyrptonite? Her x-ray vision can pierce through anything.\" Lucila wanted to be reassured that she would indeed be able to inflict lethal harm upon Linda Logan during the awarding ceremony the next day. \"She can see through everything except Lead. That is one of their weaknesses. The banished elders of Argo City told us that magick mixed with a dash of Krptonite would be instant death for their like. \" \"I don't know... I hope we have enough Kryptonite powder...\" \"Lucila, I have been with those who wished nothing more than the destruction of the House of El. They spared no secrets when Selena and I asked them for information. Their only request was that we set them free from the Phantom Zone after we had killed the clan members. Alas, Argo City was destroyed before I could continue the legacy of your mother. We will avenge her and all those who wished to see the likes of Kara -El dead.\" Bianca declared self-assuredly. She took the coffer in her hands and immediately felt the evil power coursing through its structure. It seemed to dislike the Kryptonite within, shaking crazily and almost breaking free of the grasp of Bianca. \"Don't just stand there! Help me!\" she ordered Lucila as the coffer pulled her in all directions. After much of a struggle, the two women finally regained control and aimed it's nozzle at the trophy. \"Join me in the chant.\" Bianca instructed. Together they chanted: \"Coffer of Shadow, coat this trophy with your venomous powder. Make the powder invisible to the sight of those whose powers are not of the magickal realm. Transfer your life sucking sediment onto the body of the woman we seek to destroy. Render her incapable of resisting her imminent death, For there is no greater power on this Earth, Than that which the coffer possesses. \" A strong, blinding light emanated from the tip of the coffer. Silver and green specks mixed with the air that seemed to be encircling the trophy. Within minutes, the Kryptonite was absorbed and coating the inner body of the steel trophy. \"We shall be victorious Lucila.\" Bianca could not help but smile as she studied their handiwork. There as not even the minutest speck of Kryptonite on the exterior of the item. **** Linda and Kali lay on the bed that she used to share with Ethan. They had gotten back quite late from the island and Kali had grown tired while flying. She slept in her mothers arms during the return flight. She heard the familiar hum of Ethan's car coming up th driveway. Dreading what he might have to say to her, she still somehow found the inner strength to get out of bed and meet him. She hoped that he would be in the mood to discuss their situation. He was sitting on the living room couch when she came down. She could hear his unsteady breathing. His heart was racing and she sensed that his body temperature was nearing fever levels. What was wrong with him? \"I knew you would come down to me.\" his voice was serious as she stepped into the dark room. He reached over to the nearby side table and turned on the lamp. \"I need to talk to you.\" \"I'm listening.\" she told him as she took the seat directly across from him. She wanted to sit beside him like she normally did but she was not sure if he wanted her anywhere near him at the moment. \"First, promise me that you will hear me out and you will consider what I am about to ask you to do.\" he wiped his hands on his pants. He was very nervous. Unsure as to how Kara would take to his request. \"Do you want a divorce?\" she asked him point blank. Her voice trying to sound unfeeling but the slight crack in her tone gave her away. \"No.\" She heaved a sigh of relief. Whatever it was he was about to ask her to do was going to be easy to hear out and possibly agree to. \"Linda....\" he began. \"No. I am not making this request of Linda.\" he stopped himself. \" Kara, listen to me. I love you. I love you and I love our daughter. But I can't live this way. I need normalcy. I need you to be my best friend, my wife, my lover, the mother of my child. I need my child to be normal. I need a normal family. \" The implication of his words struck her thoughts even before he could voice it out. \"No! Don't ask that of me! Not the transformation chamber!\" she exclaimed. \"I would not ask if it was not important to me.\" \"You are asking me to give up who I am. What my heritage is. The duty I was born to do. You are asking me to take my daughter's birthright away from her? You are asking me to forget my heritage! How can you be so selfish? The world needs me!\" \"The world has Kal-El!\" \"The world is a much better place with Kal-El and I protecting it!\" \"And you would just as soon lay our daughter's life on the line as well? This does not have to be her future. Don't dictate who and what our daughter should be.\" he reasoned. \"This is her heritage Ethan. The legacy of our people is to protect the innocents of this planet. It is our duty.\" she tried to explain. \"What about your duty to me? Kara, I no longer know where I fit in your life. If I fit in it at all. I don't even have a place in my daughter's life!\" \"You made it that way Ethan! You chose to remove yourself from our lives! Don't blame this on my heritage! You knew who I was when you married me. I never hid anything from you. You knew what our life was going to be like! You promised me that it would not bother you! Why the sudden change?\" \"Because we are a family now! Because I want to know that I don't have to keep worrying that my child or my wife will be killed one day because one of you ran into Kryptonite and did not realize it! Because I can't understand who either of you are anymore! Because I don't know if I can still keep you happy even though I am an ordinary human being!\" his voice cracked as he defended his stand. \"Ethan... you once told me that a poor gardener could make a rich boarding school girl happy. You know all about my past. My happiness always came from knowing you accepted who I was unconditionally. You have always made me happy. I was at my happiest when we became a family. You chose to destroy that happiness. You chose to destroy what we had as a family.\" \"Will you do it for me?\" he wanted to know. \"I don't know if I can. You are asking too much of me Ethan.\" \" I have never asked anything of you Kara.\" \"And when you did ask of me, you chose to ask me to become something I am not. I love you but I do not know if I can do it even for you Ethan. This is all that my parents left me with. This is all that reminds of my treasured past.\" \"Kara, I...\" \"Go away Ethan.\" the tears began to stream down her face. \"I don't want to see you for a while. You can visit Kali if you want to but you have to tell Lucy first so that I can leave. Do you understand what I am trying to say?\" \"You won't do it? Not even to save our family? Don't you love me anymore?\" \"I don't know if I can love a man who is asking me to forget everything about my past and pretend that the past 21 years of my life never happened.\" She stood up and opened the door for him. \"Give me time to think and decide.\"[Chapter 12] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Meet Ethan Logan Asnthe front door closed, Kali, who had been sitting at the top of thenstairs, listening to her parents conversation, ran back to the roomnand took her place on the bed. Her eyes shut as tightly as she couldnwhile she tried to process everything she had just heard. How couldnher father have turned out to be such a mean man? Why was he askingnher to stop protecting the people that her grandparents told hernthey, the members of the House Of El, were born to protect? What wasnwrong with what they were destined to do? Her mother had been doingnit for a long time now, why was it now a problem for her parents?nWould he force her to give her powers up too? Well, that simply wouldnnot do. She just would not allow him to do such a thing to her, andnshe knew her mother would not do it either. **** Thendoor to her sanctuary slid open as she flicked a hidden lightswitchnon the backwall of her clothes closet. Kara needed time to be alonenwith her thoughts. The bedroom was not the best place for her to donthat right now with Kali sleeping soundly on the bed. This was thenplace she often ran to when she felt the pressures of her double lifenbeginning to bear down upon her. If anybody had told her long beforenshe met Ethan that she would be leading the life of a hero and annordinary human being at the same time, she would have told thatnperson what a crazy idea that was. Now that she was living it though,nshe wondered if she had made the right decision in getting married sonearly. It was really just something she did because it felt right atnthe time. After everything Ethan had been through to save her,nmarrying him seemed to be the right kind of payback. She did love himnwith all her heart and being, but now it seemed like they had bothnrushed into the decision. Lust and libido ruled over logic perhaps? Who knew that being married wouldnhave become such a herculean task for her? Was it this difficult fornall married people? Or just those married to aliens from destroyednplanets? Was Kal-El having the same problems now that he too wasnmarried to Lois? Having the child was totally out of the equation.nWho would have been able to predict that Ethan would ask her for morenthan she was willing to surrender either? How much was she willing to give upnfor him? Did she really have it within her to turn her back on hernheritage? Where was Kal-El when she needed him? Why was he doing thisnto her? Was he right? Did she really willingly endanger herself?nWould she be willing to see Kali hurt in the process of fulfillingnthis legacy? Was she forcing an enormous responsibility upon herndaughter ? When would the self-sacrifice on the part of the House OfnEl ever end? Would they always have to endanger their own lives fornthe sake of mankind? When did their responsibility to the legacy endnand their personal commitments to their relationships begin? These were the thoughts runningnthrough Kara's mind as she perused the memories of her life on earthnas captured within the various pictures and souveniers that she hadncollected over the years. Ethan insisted on this room being built fornher when they renovated the house. It was a project he undertook withnKal-El because they obviously could not hire contractors for such andelicate task. \"When did everything changenbetween us Ethan? What should I do?\" she whispered as she pickednup the recent portrait that Jimmy took of them at the party. Ethannhad his body turned away from her in it. He did not look happy atnall. She fought back the tears as she remembered how angry he wasnthat day. She should have seen the signs that their marriage was inntrouble but she chose to ignore it. Hoping it would resolve itselfnlike all the other problems they had faced in the past. **** Through her half closed eyes, she sawnher mother disappear into the closet. What was behind the wall? Herncuriosity getting the better of her, Kali slowly got out of bed andnheaded for the now closed closet door. \"Mommy,nwhere are you?\" shenheard Kali's muffled voice beyond the walls of the room. \"I'm in here Kali. Open thencloset and float up a bit inside. There is a light switch near thenceiling, flick it and the door will open for you.\" sheninstructed. She wiped away her tears as she heardnthe pressurized door opening. She had made up her mind the day thatnEthan left them that Kali would never see her crying. Whether Kalinknew it or not, she was the only thing holding her mother together atnthat point in time. \"Wow! What room is this mommy?\"nKali rushed over to the rack that held her mother's Supergirl suits.n\"I want one mommy!\" \"It'sna game to her.\" Kara sadly realized as Kali grabbed a cape and ran around the room,nholding it behind her. It was obvious to her that Kali still did notnfully grasp the responsibility of being a Supergril. \"You will wear those suits whennyou get older Kali. In the meantime, just enjoy learning to use yournpowers. There is no rush for you.\" She lept lightly onto her mother'snlap and settled in as Kara wrapped her arms around Kali's waist. nThey used the cape as a blanket to snuggle under as they satntogether. \"Mommy...\" \"Yes sweetie?\" \"Does daddy hate us?\" She choked on her own breath at thenquestion. What would ever drive Kali to ask such a question? \"Don't be silly Kali. Daddynloves us both very much.\" \"That's not true mommy. I heardnhim.\" \"Heard him say what?\" \"Mommy, why doesn't he want usnto be Supergirls?\" So that was it. Kali had heardneverything. She should have known that Kali's super hearing wouldnhave become active the same time as all her other powers. She shouldnhave been more careful. Maybe warned Ethan and took him out of thenhouse to talk to him. \"Mommy?\" \"It isn't that he doesn't wantnus to be Supergirls Kali. He is just worried that we could get hurt.nThere are some people out there who do not like us. They want to hurtnus so they can continue to do the bad things that we stop them fromndoing. Daddy just doesn't want to see us being hurt because he cannotnprotect us the way that we can protect him.\" \"Why doesn't he talk tongrandfather and gradnmother? They can explain it to him like they didnme.\" \"It isn't that simple Kali. Yourndaddy isn't like us. He is a full blooded human he does notnunderstand about our powers and responsibilities as well as we do.nThat we were born to protect all of those which have a life. Be itnanimal or human Kali, we protect them equally.\" \"So Daddy does not want us tonprotect him or the animals or mankind? That is mean!\" \"He isn't being mean Kali. Younare just too young to understand what is going on right now.\"nHow could she explain that he was being protective of them andnnothing more? That is what was making Ethan angry, the fact that henremained powerless to protect them from certain dangers that hisnworld posed to the people he loved the most. \"Kali, are you sure you want tonbe a Supergirl like me? You don't have to be if you don't want to.\"nShe was going to give her daughter the choice that was not given tonher. \"I want to be a Supergirl mommy.nGrandmother says that I can do plenty of good things. I can continuento protect the world when you and uncle Kal-El get too old to do it.nMommy, this is who we are. I understand it. I am not an ordinarynchild. I understand and accept that.\" \"Okay. Just remember, you cannstop being a Supergirl anytime you want to.\" she would leaventhat door open for her. This was a legacy she could turn her back onnif she wanted to. Only Kara really had a sort of payback attached tonthe legacy and she was willing to fulfill that. But her daughter, shenshould be free of the legacy if she wishes to be. Just as Ethannwanted. \"Mommy, promise me something?\" \"Promise you what Kali?\" \"Promise me we won't ever stopnbeing Supergirls? I want to protect the planet. I want to be justnlike you and Uncle Kal-El.\" \"I can't promise you that Kali.\" \"Why not mommy?\" \"Well, your father is asking menfor something else.\" \"Daddy is selfish! I don't likenhim anymore!\" \"Karalinda Lee Logan! You willnstop talking about your father that way!\" she warned her. \"Nonmatter how bad it sounds to you, he has only our best interest atnheart! Do not ever forget that!\" \"Henhas only our best interest at heart.\" Her own words resonated within hernthoughts. She needed to talk to somebody who could understand whatnshe was going through. Who would know what she could best do in thensituation. She needed her parents. **** Lucy was half awake when she showednup at Linda's door around midnight. Linda had suddenly called hernover and Jimmy was kind enough to drop her off even though he hadnjust gotten hom from work and looked like he was ready to fall intonbed. They were living together in her apartment until she becamencomfortable enough with the idea of being married to him. Lucy was annew aged woman who did not believe that marriage was necessary innorder to share your life with the man of your dreams. Seeing what hernbest friend was currently going through was not helping to change hernmind regarding her opinion of marriage either. \"This better be good Linda. Inwas already dreaming of my first job at the Daily Planet when younwoke me. You are lucky Jimmy came home otherwise I do not know how Inwould have gotten here. You know I cannot drive half asleep.\" \"I really, really apologize forndoing this to you Lucy. But you are the only one I can leave withnKali on short notice without her throwing a temper tantrum. I need tongo to Heritage Island for a few hours.\" \"Is something wrong?\"nLucy's voice suddenly filled with concern. It was never good forneither Kal-El or Kara to need to go to their respective littlenKyrptons on Earth. That always meant a big problem brewing. \"No. Nothing is wrong. I justnneed to talk to my parents right now. There is a decision I have tonmake and I cannot make it without hearing their opinion first.\"nShe was leading Lucy up to the master's bedroom. \"Shouldn't we take her to hernroom?\" Lucy knew Kali was too heavy for her to lift. \"Shenhas to learn to sleep in her own room.\" she continued in anwhisper. \"Kali can stay here tonight.nJust sleep with her and explain to her that I left for a while inncase she wakes , if she says anything negative about her dad,njust ignore her alright?\" Linda walked over to the window andnopened it. \"I should be back in a few hours.\" \"What did Ethan do this time? \"nLucy was pretty much fed up with what she perceived to be his temperntantrum and wished he would just get over it already. She had no ideanof the real gravity of the situation that Linda and Ethan'snrelationship was facing. The silence between them was enough for Lucynto understand that Linda troubled and needed space right now. \"We'll be here Linda. Just... bencareful out there alright? Don't get distracted while flying.\"nshe somehow still could not shake the thought that some evil forcenfrom the past was hovering around her friend, who smiled at hernbefore flying off into the chilly fall night. Lucy hurriedly closednthe window after her to preserve the warmth in the room. **** Kal-El screwed on the last piece ofnthe puzzle that would help the newly built motor function the way itnwas designed to. All he needed now was Ethan's car to mount it into. \"Ethan will now be a real membernof the House Of El father.\" he smiled as he spoke to thendisembodied voice once again. \"Ethan will forever be human nonmatter what you or Kara do. No amount of technology or magick willnchange that. You will soon see what kind of folly you have creatednKal-El.\" \"Can't you be supportive fornjust once father? If you can't be a part of the solution, thennplease, I beg of you father, do not make the problem any worse.\"nKal-El threw down the greasy rug he was holding and went to lie downnon a slab of ice for a while. He had been working non-stop for thenpast 3 days and needed to clear his thoughts. How could he get Ethannto lend him his car? **** The island emerged like a whalenamidst the darkness of the sea. It welcomed Kara into its lovingnembrace, seemingly responsive to the mixed emotions she had withinnher at the time. Everything came to life as she walked through thenhalls of the dome towards the hall of records where the computernbearing her parents images was housed. The holographic images came tonlife as the sensors picked up on her entry into the room. \"What is troubling you my child?nOur sensors indicate a hieghtened sense of sadness, worry, andnindecision within you.\" Alura asked. \"Mother, I don't know who tonturn to. I need advise. I am at a point in my life when I am beingnforced to choose between who I am and who Ethan wants me to be.\"nshe did her best to control her emotions as she took a seat infrontnof the image console. \"He wants you to complete thenhumanization process?\" Alura seemed to be expecting thensituation. \"Yes mother. But I do not knownif I can, or if I should. I know Kal-El did it before....\" \"Kal-El did it once before fornall the wrong reasons. He was being selfish at the time and chose tonstop honoring the memory of his people in the name of his heart. Thatnis something that we had hoped we had prepared you to decide aboutnwhen the time came. However, we did not expect it to come this soon.\" \"Tell me what to do mother.\" \"Nobody can tell you what to donKara. This is one time when you must follow the dictates of yournheart. Listen to it. What does it tell you to do? There is no wrongnor right answer this time my child. Do what you believe will be bestnfor you and Kali. For your family.\" \"My heart tells me to benselfish. But I was raised better than that. The council had told menthat the Kryptonian blood will continue to run within the veins of mynchildren and our duty would be to honor that great past from which wenall came from.\" \"Will that decision make younhappy my child?\" \"My sense of duty transcendsnpersonal happiness mother. I cannot willingly surrender our familynlegacy in the name of love.I can never lose sight of who I truly amnand what my role is in this world. Kal-El has trained me well, justnas you said he would. He helped me understand how much normalcy I cannhave in my life by human terms. I cannot and should not expectnanything more. Having Kali, this family, it was an added bonus.Anreward if you will.\" the sadness in her eyes was evident. Shenwas saying what she knew would make her parents happy to hear, evennthough it was tearing her up inside to sacrifice her relationshipnwith the only man she would ever love. \"Duties aside Kara, you cannotnsacrifice your personal happiness in the name of our family legacy.nNobody could and would expect you to make such a sacrifice.\" \"It is a sacrifice I am willingnto make mother. It is the only way I know to keep the memory of ArgonCity and Krypton alive. I just wish Ethan would understand that. \"nthe frustration in her voice clued in her mother to the difficultiesnher daughter was experiencing. \"Do you understand why Ethan isnasking you to make such a supreme sacrifice? Surely his opinions werenshaped by some things in his life.\" \"Mother, we cannot carry on anconversation without arguing. That is why he moved out of the house.nHe refuses to discuss anything with me unless I am in total agreementnwith him.\" It suddenly occured to her that Zor-El had not madenan appearance yet. \"Is something wrong with father's hologram?\" \"He is here. Listening to you.nHe asks that you get some sleep for now and allow us to help you innthe morning. The sleep will help you clear your thoughts.\" **** Ethan was sleeping on the sofa bednwhen the now familiar voice of his father in law pierced hisnsubconsicious. The voice was probing, looking for clues as to why henhad a sudden change of attitude towards his wife's family history.nSurely the answers lay somewhere within the deep recesses of hisnmind. Among the memories he wanted to forget or keep hidden from thenprying eyes of the world. \"You must remember Ethan.nRemember where you came from. Remember why you fell in love withnKara...\" Zorl-El's voice seemed to be instructing him. \"I don't want to remember. Itnhurts too much. Don't make me!\" he was pleading loudly as henslept. Suddenly he was ten years old again.nHe was sitting on a swing in the school playground during recess. Thenprincipal came over to him with a grim look on his face. This was thenday he learned that his parents had died in a firey car crash whilenon their way to a school reunion in Smallville. He saw himselfnrunning away from the principal. He kicked the school security guardnin the shin and swung himself out of the school gate. He was runningnat top speed now. Out of breath by the time he got home, the scenenbefore him changed as he entered the hallway. It was now after hisnparents funeral. His uncles and aunts were in anconclave inside the house while he sat on the steps of the porch,nwaiting for his fate to be decided. Who was he going to live with?nDid any of them really want him to come live with them? The nextnthing he knew, he was packed up and leaving the only home he evernknew to live with his uncle, his mother's brother. Ethan saw his life pass in reviewnfrom that point. Now he was remembering and seeing how he had beenntolerated by his relatives but not really loved nor welcomed intontheir family. They never wanted him to live for a long time with anynof them. They treated him like a nuisance who needed to be put upnwith until some other relative came and took him away at the requestnof his previous caretaker. He was always an outsider looking in andngetting by on their pity. He never really had a home after hisnparents died. Nobody really cared about him. He was a teenager now. Running aroundnwith the wrong crowd while in high school saw him land in jail a fewntimes. He had done it all. Petty theft left him with a juvy recordnthat luckily, remained sealed and was eventually erased. He learnednto drink around the same time too. So oftentimes he would be passednout in the street or sleeing in his own vomit at a friend's house.nEthan was not really a bad kid. He was just looking for acceptance. Anplace to call home. People who loved him instead of just toleratingnhim. After coming out of Juvenile Hall atnthe end of one of his exploits, his relatives chose to disown him.nThey had enough of him and no longer wished to be bothered withntrying to raise him. They were convicned he would never become annupright young man who could be an asset to society. They even took upna pool to see how long it would take before he landed in juvy again.nLater on, they decided to turn over what was left of his parentsngardening business to him and told him to grow up. Without anybody tonlean on for support, guidance, or understanding, that was exactlynwhat he was forced to do. But the rebel within him did not reallyntake his job seriously. If nobody wanted to help or love him, then hendid not want them either. Then he came to the day that changenhis life. Linda's eyes staring at him as he was held captive insidenthe tractor basket. He would never forget the way he felt that day.nThe way her sea blue eyes calmed him down and reassured him. The loventhat it held for him when they shared that moment in the Wurlitzer.nThe pain it held when she left him all those times not because shenwanted to, but because she belonged to a different world back then. \"Please, I do not want tonremember any more. Stop it Zor-El!\" \"Remember why you love myndaughter Ethan. Do not destroy the special relationship that the twonof you have. Being a family has nothing to do with heritage ornlegacies. You have to see, you have to understand. Yours is the mostnspecial family on this planet. Do not forsake what has been entrustednto you by the forces of the universe.\" he forced him tonremember more than he was willing to recall. Kara had turned his life around. Hernlove forced him to grow up in ways his relatives never realized hencould. He wanted her to be proud of him, and proud of him she was.nShe loved him without condition. Even though he could never measurenup to how special she was, she never let him feel anything other thannthat he was the most important part of her life. She gave him thensense of security and love that he longed for ever since his parentsndied. She provided him with a family that never shunned him nor madenhim feel merely tolerated. She had given him a new lease on life andnyet there he was, willing to throw away everything she offered him.nWhat a fool he was! Kara loved him. He was always hernpriority. He just refused to share her with the world because he wasnafraid she would run out of love to give him. Now, with Kali aroundnand her heightened duties as Supergirl, he feared that she was justntolerating him. That he had lost his place in her life because allnher activities would make her tire of him. That is why he wanted hernto stop being the special person that she was. He refused to acceptnthat she had a heart that could love everyone equally. But that henwas always that one special person whom she would love the most. Henwas her life just as she was his. She loved him with an intensitynthat he always tried to equal. She loved him more than her own life.nShe would do anything he asked of her to prove it. Why did he notnrealize that sooner? Why did he want to test her loyalty? Why did henwant to push their love to its limits? Recalling everything they hadnbeen through, he realized how their love was the one constant thingnin their lives that would never waver or change. He sprang from bed drenched in sweatnfrom fighting the memories Zor-El had forced him to relive. \"Whatnhave I done? God! What have I done?\" Holding his head in his hands, henbegan sobbing like a man who had just realized that his family hadndied all over again. Through his closed eyes, he saw the eyes ofnKara, the innocence and warmth that he loved to see within her doenlike eyes was replaced with hatred and anger. A look that he hadnplaced there because of his selfishness. \"Is it too late?\" he askednZorl-El. \"Nothing is ever too late mynson.\"[Chapter 13] DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

He looked up towards their bedroom window and saw it was open. What emergency was Kara attending to now? He decided not to go into the house so as not to wake Kali. Kara would see his car in the driveway anyway and she was sure to come and talk to him. If she didn't, then he would walk up to the door and ring the bell. He rolled down the car windows and reclined the driver's seat so he could close his eyes a bit. Thanks to the subconscious visit from Zor-El, he had come to realize that the problem between them was not that she was a super hero, but rather, that they understood very little about their family backgrounds. All these years, they had survived only on the love they felt for each other. A love that was based solely on the time they had spent together and what they knew of each other until that moment. Neither of them really bothered to delve deeper into their pasts in order to understand how they each got to the current point in their lives. With the birth of Karalinda, the time had finally come for them to discover each others past. Not only because it would help strengthen their relationship as husband and wife, but because Kali deserved to know everything about her Kryptonian and human family sides. A soft, cooling breeze passed through the open car windows as Kara landed outside his door. He met her with a loving smile on his face. \"What are you doing here? What else do you want me to do?\" her voice had a demanding tone. \"Don't get mad. I came to talk to you. But not here.\" he opened the car door and got out. \"Walk with me?\" his voice was soft and uncertain. He had hurt her so much already that Ethan knew he would be lucky if she did not pick him up by his jaw and hurl him through the air. A manuver she often used on the drunken men she needed to put in their place during her missions. \"We don't have anything else to talk about. I told you to leave me alone for a few days. What you are asking me to do is not easy.\" her face was stern as she spoke. \"Please Kara. There is something you need to know about me.\" he held her hand and led her away from the driveway. Her emotions could not help but soften at his touch. Damn him! she wanted to stay mad at him, to make him feel the same pain that she had been suffering at his hands lately. But all she could really do was follow him. She was weak when it came to Ethan. She loved him so much that she would do anything he asked, including completing the humanization process at the expense of the family legacy. That was the decision she had come to that morning before flying from the island. If she were not so angry with him, she would have probably told him that already. \"Where are we going?\" she asked as she slowly changed into her street clothes as they neared the end of the driveway. \"There are some people I want you to meet.\" he replied. Lucy watched them from the master's bedroom. She had heard the rustling leaves and knew that Kara had returned but had not entered the house. \"Work it out you two. For Kali's sake.\" she muttered as Kali stirred in bed. **** They walked in silence for most of the trip but never let go of each other's hands. Each afraid that the other would let go, they gripped each other so tightly that Ethan's knuckles had turned white from the restricted bloodflow to his hand. They soon turned into a well manicured gate of the Midvale Memorial Park. \"What are we doing here?\" Linda asked. Why would Ethan take her to a cemetery? \"The people I want you to meet, they are here.\" he explained as he led her around a rotunda and down a street that read Avenue A on the signage. \"I don't understand why you would want me to meet them here.\" she wondered. \"Because Linda, I want you to meet -- my parents.\" he walked up to a tombstone and knelt before it. Eric Logan Morrison Cathy Morrison Loving parents of Ethan. Gone too soon. She knelt beside him and cupped his face lovingly in her hands. This was a side of him that she had never known about. It was no wonder that he helped her the way he did when she came to him after Argo City had been destroyed. He knew exactly how she felt. \"You never told me about them.\" she whispered. \"Why is their surname Morrison and yours Logan?\" \"You never asked me Linda. Just like I never asked you about yours. None of these information seemed important at the time. I did not want you to ever know about them.\" \"What do you mean? Our parents are important Ethan. I never asked because I thought that you would eventually introduce me to them. When you were ready. It never occurred to me that they were dead and that is why I never met them.\" \"I know Linda... It's just that... Zor-El, he came to me last night. He helped me realize some things. I need you to understand...\" he began to ramble. \"Ethan, you're not making any sense.\" \"Don't know how to tell you...\" his whole body began to shake. \"Ethan, what's happening? Are you ill?\" She hugged him and rubbed his back to warm him up. \"He doesn't want to remember Kara.\" she heard her father's voice in her mind. \"What doesn't he want to remember father? How can I help him?\" she asked worriedly. \"Should not tell you...Car crash...Ruin my image... Zor-El called me \"my son\"... family loves me...\" Ethan's eyes rolled in its socket before her fell to the ground. \"Ethan!\" Linda cried out in confusion as the morning sun beat upon them. **** Kal-El's long range vision zeroed in on Ethan's car parked in their driveway as he flew over Midvale. He also noted that only Lucy was in the house with Kali thanks to his x-ray vision. \"Perfect!\" he exclaimed as he leaned in the direction of the Logan house. Lucy opened the door when he rang the bell. \"Tell Ethan I borrowed his car. I will bring it straight back.\" he instructed as he hoisted the car over his head and flew off with it. \"Kal-El! You don't know how to drive!\" she hollered after him before realizing that he had flown away with the car upon his shoulders. She simply smiled and then closed the door. \"Aunt Lucy?\" Kali was standing at the top of the stairs wiping the sleep from her eyes. \"Where's mommy?\" \"She'll be back soon sweetie. She had to go with daddy for a bit. Do you want some breakfast?\" **** \"Kara, listen to me, I will help you understand Ethan the way I helped him understand himself. Do everything I say.\" Zor-El Instructed. \"Yes father.\" she replied with worry in her voice. Ethan lay at her feet unmoving. His face registering pain for some reason. \"Carry him to the shade and lie beside him.\" Picking him up effortlessly, she lay him under the shade of the tree a number of steps away from the tombstone of his parents. \"Lie beside him and hold his hand. Concentrate on hearing his thoughts my daughter. Be prepared for you will enter his subconscious world. You will see things he has hidden away for so long. \" \"I understand father.\" she placed herself in the position as instructed and soon found herself drifting off to sleep. She was standing in front of a modest bungalow now. Laughter was emanating from within the open front door. She entered the house and followed the sound of happy bantering. In the backyard of the house, she saw a young man of no more than 20 and a woman even younger than him working in the garden patch. A little boy who had the under developed features of Ethan was busy alongside the man, digging up holes in the ground with his mini shovel. \"Ethan!\" she exclaimed as she watched the happy family repotting various flowers and bulbs. The little boy was overcome with happiness and was playfully throwing soil towards his father's work area. \"Stop doing that Ethan.\" Eric playfully warned him as he scooped up the little boy and shook him around to drop his shovel. The boy laughed heartily as the shaking seemed to tickle his funny bone. \"Stop it you two or we will never get this done before nightfall.\" Catherine warned them with a smile on her face. Ethan had an equal share of his parents looks. His father's eyes and his mother's smile combined to create the most striking facial features she had ever seen in a man, kryptonian or human, before. \"He was so happy as a child father. How can I see more?\" \"Be patient Kara. He has to want to show you more.\" Soon, the scene before her had changed. He was getting out of his parents car at school. They were saying goodbye and reminded him that they would be home on Sunday evening. He was to follow the instructions of the baby sitter to the letter and not give her any grief. \"Is this the day father?\" \"Yes Kara. It is.\" He was riding in a car with a man she had never seen before. He had a family resemblance that reminded her of Eric Logan Morrison. She could only surmise that this was perhaps a brother of his. \"But they promised to come home on Sunday!\" Ethan reasoned out between sobs as he sat in the front seat of the car. \"They are dead Ethan. Now suck it up and deal with it like a man.\" the stranger said in a very harsh tone. \"Oh Ethan...\" Kara cried softly, sensing the grief and fear of the child. \"Who will I live with now?\" \"That young man, is the problem. We all have more than enough children of our own to deal with without having to worry about an orphaned child of our brother's.\" In what seemed like a whirlwind of visions, she saw him being bounced around from home to home within his immediate family. Neither one of them actually paying attention to his needs nor helping him to grieve the loss of his family. In one particularly vivid memory of his, it was Christmas morning and the family of the sister of his father had gathered around the Christmas tree to open presents. Ethan had been sitting in a corner, completely ignored by the family. Not a single gift was passed on to him. He had been effectively forgotten by the family until lunchtime came and they remembered he was in the house. She watched as he silently cried in his corner, calling out for his mom and dad. She made a move to go and console him. \"Do not interfere my child. You must not to anything to alter his memories. You could change the future time line for yourself and him.\" Zor-El warned. \"But look at him father.\" she pleaded. \"No Kara. Stay put.\" Suddenly, Kara's head was spinning from the sound of Ethan's voice as a young man. His voice broke as he screamed in sheer pain. It took a while for her vision to center on what was happening to him. He was reliving a moment. A moment that made him grip her hand so tightly and cause his body to have convulsions as he lay unconscious. \"That will teach you to fail in school!\" A different man, but still with the family face of Eric, was hitting him as hard as he could across the knees with a wide belt buckle. Ethan's pants were pooled at his feet as he stood there wearing only his shorts and a very worn out jersey shirt that was at least 4 sizes too big for him. \"Stop it Uncle Nick! I am begging you!\" Ethan cried out as his knees gave out from under him. He tried to grab onto his uncle for support but he tore his hands away from his body. The man picked him up from the floor by his shirt cuff and punched him in the stomach. Ethan curled up in a heap on the floor from the impact. Blood trailed out from the corner of his mouth. \"Waste my money on your useless education! You are just like my brother! You will never amount to anything! You crappy piece of dung! You should have died with them! You are a leech sucking on the Morrison family! A disgrace to the family legacy!\" She could not help herself any longer. Kara ran forward and tried to grab the man who was hurting him but her hands passed through him as if she were a ghost. \"Do not intervene! Just listen and understand.\" she was warned angrily by her father. \"Mom! Dad! I can't take it anymore! Help me! Take me! I will welcome death just so this suffering will end!\" Ethan prayed when his uncle finally stopped beating him and walked away. Leaving him to medicate his wounds and welts on his own. \"Do not help that freeloader unless you want to be beaten yourself.\" his uncle warned his children who had began to approach Ethan to help him. Kara finally realized what his greatest fear was. Ethan could never tell when he might die and her insistence on rescuing the people of Midvale, of earth, could one day leave Kali without any parents early on in her life. He did not wish for Kali to undergo the traumatic events that he went through. It was a pain no parent would ever willingly allow a child suffer. As if reacting to the painful memories, he forced himself to recall his safe place. His happy place where he felt most secure and loved. His memories were all of his moments with her. She was his safe place. Now that she had seen his life and his fears, she finally understood where he was coming from. **** She felt his body relax as he recalled more and more of their moments together. It did not take long for Kara to wake up beside him at the very same moment that he too opened his eyes. It was almost mid day. They stared at each other, communicating without words. It was Kara who broke the silence. \"The way those people treated you, I can understand why you dropped the Morrison from your name.\" \"Logan was my father's middle name. I couldn't continue using Morrison. Not after all the things they made me go through. When my parents died, I forgot what it was like to love and be loved. Then you came along...\" Ethan explained before an awkward silence came between them again. \"Let's go home hon. I understand everything now.\" she gently took his hand so they could stand up together. All of their altercations were now forgiven and forgotten. Understanding and compromise were now in its place for both of them. He gripped her hand ever so tightly. Afraid that she would let him go. Somehow, she understood the message he was trying to convey to her. \"I'll never let you go. I'll always love you, no matter what happens. I am the one constant in your life.\" she reassured him the only way she knew how. By tracing his lips with her thumb. He closed his eyes and felt the heightened sensation that her touch awakened within him. Taking a deep breath and pulling her closer to him, he smelled her strawberry scented hair as she lay her head on his chest. \"Love each other forever?\" he lifted her face closer to his. \"For eternity.\" she parted her lips just slightly to allow his lips to envelop hers with such a passion that they both knew their love could overcome any problems that may come their way.[Chapter 14] The Monster Revealed Lucy could not believe how fast the little girl was growing up. She knew that Kryptonians developed faster than humans but being a half breed, she expected Kali to slow down to an almost human pace of development. From the looks of it, the human DNA had nothing on its Kryptonian counterpart. For all physical intents and purposes, nobody would have said that this little girl had been born only a few days ago. She had all the physical attributes of a six year old child, which led Lucy to wonder as to whether she had the mental abilities of the same age as well. After playing one game of scrabble and chess with Kali, Lucy found her question answered. The child was far more advanced than any Earth child. It seemed to her that Kali absorbed instructions like a sponge and had the analytical ability of a super computer. She found herself exhausted after playing all the board games that they could find in the house. \"I'm tired Kali. Let's rest while we wait for your mom and dad okay?\" she suggested when asked what they would be doing next. \"But I'm not tired Aunt Lucy. I'm bored.\" Kali whined as she turned the knob manually on the TV set. \"Oops! I broke it!\" Lucy turned around from the shelf where she was putting away the games in the lower cabinet. Kali stood there holding the television knob in her hand. \"I can't stick it back in. Can't change channels. Will mom be mad?\" the child said worriedly. \"Didn't Kara teach you to control your strength?\" Lucy took the knob from her hand and put it on the shelf. \"Your dad will just have to fix this when he comes home later.\" \"She did. But I often forget.\" The child walked over to the window and tried to see if her mother was flying in yet. \"Dad is never coming back. He doesn't want us.\" Kali told her. Lucy did as Linda had instructed her and ignored what the child said. She knew that the child was wrong and Ethan loved his family. He just needed time to embrace and fully understand the situation. Kali was surprised to see that she could see so far ahead of her that her vision focused on the playground 20 blocks away. A group of little girls were playing Lacrosse on the small field. \"Aunt Lucy, what are they playing?\" \"What is who playing?\" Lucy replied absentmindedly. \"Those girls.\" \"Where?\" Lucy went over to the window to see what Kali was asking about. \"There's nothing there Kali.\" \"Yes there is. Girls like me. they are running around throwing a ball into a stick with nets. \" Lucy recognized the sport, Lacrosse. The very sport that Linda and she played on the team of at Midvale School for Girls. Had it really been that long already since they got out of high school? So, the child had an interest in sports just like her mom. Now she knew how to fill the rest of the child's time while waiting. \"It's called Lacrosse. Your mom and I used to play that game in high school.\" A thought suddenly occurred to her. Did Kara know that Kali's long distance vision was was now active? \"The Lacrosse field is 20 blocks away. Why don't we walk over so you can watch them play? Maybe they will let you play with them.\" she coaxed. \"I don't know. I was told never to leave the house without mom or Uncle Kal-El.\" \"We will leave her a note. C'mon kid. Linda won't mind. You will be with Auntie Lucy.\" **** The first time Kara had flown away with Ethan in her arms, she had been a new visitor to the planet and she was trying to save his life as he lay unconscious in a bump car. This time, she was flying with him alongside her, wide awake and smiling at her. It seemed to her like a heavy load had been lifted from him and he could not wait to get on with their life as a family. \"So, Kali can fly now? How old is she in human years?\" he struggled to make himself heard over the roar of the wind current passing over them. \"Yes. She is quite excited to show you what she can do. She's almost like a mini-me.\" Kara pulled him closer so she could talk into his ear. \"I'm excited to show her how much I love her and how proud I am of her.\" he noticed Kara's face turn to sadness before she smiled at him. \"Ethan, Kali loves you. But, there are some things she still has to understand about you. She heard you say some things... If she she resents you at first... Just be patient okay? She's our daughter. She will come around.\" Kara hoped that Ethan understood what she implying. \"It was all my fault Kara. When I first held her in my arms, I let her feel my love. Then I shunned her and ignored her all because of my personal views. My selfish motives. I ignored her because I did not know how to treat her. I have a lot of mending to do with her.\" **** Since Kali was not used to being around other children, she was apprehensive about stepping into the park and talking to other kids. Choosing to sit on a bench near the playing field, Lucy did her best to coax her to try mingling with the other kids who were there to try out for Lacrosse Little League. \"Don't be afraid Kali, go ahead and talk to them. Just don't use your powers okay?\" she encouraged her while one of the players got together an extra set of equipment for Kali to borrow during the game. \"But I do not know how to play.\" Kali reasoned out as Lucy tried but failed to pull her off the bench. \"Please don't make Aunt Lucy pull an hernia Kali. Just try it. Humor me?\" The little girl heaved a sigh before finally standing up and walking silently towards the rest of the girls on the field. With a little coaching from one of the mothers who acted as the team coach, Kali was well on her towards helping the team win their practice game. She was throwing the ball into the goal with the greatest of accuracy and stealing it from the other team even before they knew she had passed in front of them. \"Pace yourself Kali! Not too fast!\" Lucy urged her to slow down when the game entered into a time-out. \"Does she play for any little league team?\" the coach asked Lucy after the game. \"We sure could use somebody that fast and accurate on our team.\" \"No. This is actually her first time out on the field. I guess she takes after her mother though. She used to play for Midvale School for Girls.\" \"Whose her mother?\" \"I don't think you know her. She used to be Linda Lee. She's Linda Logan now.\" Lucy volunteered the information. \"Nerdy Linda Lee? The gal who broke the Lacrosse ball on her back?\" \"How did you know...\" \"You're Lucy! I almost did not recognize you! The two of you were inseparable at school! I can't believe she's a mother now too! You have changed a lot over 4 years. Don't you recognize me?\" the woman put on her glasses, hoping it would jog Lucy's memory. Now that Lucy stared at the woman before her, memories from high school came back to her. Somehow she saw this woman fatter, wearing glasses, trying to torment Linda in the school hallway... It couldn't be! But it was -- Muffy! \"Muffy? Muthilda? Is it really you?\" She could not believe her eyes. The school bully was now a little league coach. Who would have thought that she would work for the Midvale School for Girls? \"Yep! It's me. Is there any chance I can talk to Linda about getting that kid of hers on my team? She plays just like her mother.\" Muffy complimented Kali. \"I dunno. Linda doesn't even know that we left the house.\" Lucy replied uncertainly. \"Well, maybe I can convince her. After all, the kid will be playing little league for our alma mater. She is going to enroll in school this year right?\" \"I don't know....\" she glanced over at Kali who was sharing an energy drink with the rest of the practice team. She seemed to take to the social situation better than her mother did. As a student at Midvale, Linda was always reserved and quiet in her own little corner. She wasn't comfortable among the other students or people if she wasn't there with at least one person she trusted. Usually Ethan or Lucy. Maybe it was because Linda was caught between two cultures for a very long time. \"Look, give her my card. Have her call me. Tell her I am no longer the bully that she knew. I'd love to catch up with her.\" Muffy handed Lucy a small slip of cardboard that contained her contact information. \"Principal Danvers isn't going to believe this.\" \"Is he still the principal?\" Lucy was surprised to hear the familiar name of their tormented high school principal. **** They flew into the open window of their bedroom, tired but happy. Ethan sunk onto the bed and moaned. He missed sleeping on the soft mattress that contoured to his shape as he stretched out. His aching body looking for comfort and relaxation. \"Lucy, we're back. Can you bring Kali up here please?\" Linda hollered downward of the stairway as she held their bedroom door open. \"Lucy?\" no response. \"I'll be right back.\" she told Ethan. Just as she was about to panic at the thought that something horrible had happened to her child and best-friend, she spotted something stuck to the door of the refrigerator with a magnet. Linda, I took Kali to the park. She got restless while waiting. Did you know her long distance vision has already kicked in? Be back as soon as I tire her out or she craves lunch. Which ever comes first. Lucy Taking the note in her hand, she returned to the room. \"Looks like Kali and Lucy are out till lunch. I better follow them and bring her back. Who knows what powers Kali has accidentally displayed by now?\" She passed by the bed absentmindedly as she used her own long distance vision as she stood by the bedside window to see what her daughter was up to. She was just about to zero in on their location when she felt Ethan sensuously wrap his arms around her. \"Worry about them later?\" He asked as he wrapped his arms around her. Wanting to keep her by his side for as long as he could. She felt the heat of his half naked body sear through her own clothes. She froze where she stood as she came to realize what would happen next, and she would willingly submit to everything he desired of her. For now she understood that her first responsibility was to him and their family, to take care of him and Kali, assure them that she would never take them for granted. If this was one of the best ways to prove her love for him each time he may have his doubts, then she would never withhold it from him. Within moments he had her out of her clothes and he was out of his remaining coverings. Her forgiveness poured out for him as they proved their love for each other while in bed. She was not going to hold back. Their family could now be mended, because their love was now healed. Lucy saw the master's bedroom window closed with its curtains down as they approached the house. She smiled a knowing smile. \"Kali, let's go have some ice cream first okay?\" **** He opened his eyes and saw her still locked in his arms with her back turned. She was breathing steadily in her sleep. \"You did not leave?\" he asked her. Her eye fluttered open as she smiled at the sound of his voice waking her. \"I would never leave you Ethan. All those times I had to... You have to understand, just like I understand now. My family is my priority but when Midvale or any other part of the world needs me, you will have to learn to share me okay? Don't worry about me. I will always come back to you, safe and sound. Our love will protect me.\" She reassured him as she turned over in his arms to face him. The clock struck noon. She jumped upright in bed, throwing his arms off of her in the process. She was late! \"School! I'm late. Leighton will have my head!\" She covered up with the blanket and headed to the bathroom to freshen up before leaving. \"I would offer to drive you but I know you can get there faster if I don't.\" Ethan grabbed his pants and pulled over his shorts. \"I didn't see your car in the driveway when we arrived honey.\" Linda kissed him before grabbing her shoulder bag and heading out the door. \"You didn't? I wonder if Lucy borrowed it?\" \"They went to the park, not the mall.\" They headed down the stairs together just as Lucy and Kali were walking into the hallway. \"Kali!\" Ethan was very happy to see his daughter. He made a move to hug her but she sped away from them towards the kitchen. The two women looked at Ethan pitifully. \"It will take time Ethan. Just keep trying to get through to her.\" Linda reminded him. \"Lucy, heading to school?\" \"Not till 2. I can stay and sit with Kali till then. So Ethan can go to work.\" she volunteered. \"Did you bring my car back?\" Ethan asked Lucy. \"Oh, about your car. Kal-El borrowed it.\" she explained. \"He said he would bring it back straightaway.\" \"What would Kal-El need with my car?\" he addressed Linda who just shrugged her shoulders. What would her cousin need a car for anyway? \"I'll take the bus then. Please tell Kal-El to bring the car to the office when he is done with it?\" he instructed Lucy. \"You bet.\" **** Kali had gone up to her room on the insistence of her mother. Lucy helped her get cleaned up before tucking her into bed for a mid morning nap. She then went into the kitchen and whipped up some lunch for both of them. The doorbell rang just as she was about to put some instant cream of mushroom soup on the stove. \"Who is it?\" she asked as she peeked into the peephole. \"Aneles. Kali's baby sitter.\" came the voice from the other side. Lucy unlocked the door and let her in. \"Where's Linda?\" she asked upon seeing Lucy at the door. This was going to be easier than she thought. \"At the school. She did not tell me that you were coming.\" Lucy was obviously distrustful of Aneles. Something really spooked her about this woman. \"Kali! Your sitter is here!\" \"No!\" Kali came speeding down the stairs. She hugged Lucy's legs tightly. \"Don't leave me with that monster! Please aunt Lucy! Take me with you!\" \"Kali, Kali, let go of my legs.\" She untangled the child and lovingly hit her but to send her up the stairs. \"I will call you later.\" \"I think you and I have to talk.\" she told Aneles, leading the way to the kitchen. \"Certainly.\" Aneles followed her. Lucy did not notice her take out a small drawstring back and empty its contents out onto her hand. They sat at the counter facing each other. \"Now what is it you want to talk to me about?\" Aneles asked. \"I was just wondering, have I met you before? You seem awfully familiar.\" \"I don't think so.\" she lied. \"Are you sure? With somebody named Selena? You look like that woman who... Wait a minute. Aneles... Selena.... Bianca!\" Lucy screamed as she saw the reflected image from the stainless steel stove. Lucy scrambled from the kitchen, she needed to protect Kali. Why didn't she believe her when she kept saying Aneles was a monster? \"Congelo!\" Bianca froze Lucy where she stood with the command of her voice. Lucy was trying to fight the spell that had been cast upon her. Her very minute movement could still be seen by Bianca. \"Don't fight it. You don't have what it takes.\" Standing in front of Lucy she blew the dust up the young woman's nose. \"O peror ut Inquam vacuus defici! Do as I say, without fail!\" Try as she might to not breathe, Lucy could not help but inhale the dust. She felt her body go numb, her mind seemed to go blank. She had no control over her body. All she could hear was Bianca's sinister laugh piercing her consciousness. \"First you, then the child, and then... Supergirl.\" **** Kali heard the front door close moments later. \"Is she gone?\" she asked upon seeing her aunt stirring the soup pot that was now brownish instead of creamy in color. \"What smells bad?\" \"Yes. That's just the soup. The color isn't so good but I know you will like it. Now sit down while I get our lunch ready.\" Lucy assured her. Kali did not notice the glass eyed looked in her aunts eyes. She followed everything she said because Kara had told her to do everything Lucy said. Kara would soon learn how wrong she was to tell her daughter to do that. For within the hallway coat closet, Bianca lay in wait to take the child with the help of her unwilling foot soldier, Lucy.[Chapter 15] Anathema ! The potion enhanced soup had the desired side effect on the little girl. She lay on the couch, curled up in a fetal position beside Lucy who was slowly feeling the effects of the controlling dust wear off. She had a headache that felt like Kara had given her a super slap across the face that left her vision blurry. Her ears also had a high pitched ringing sound within that she could not shake. She tried to stand up and head to the bathroom to wash her face but ended up slumping into a nearby chair. Bianca continued to watch the activities of the two from the safety of the coat closet. When she was sure that they would not hear her, she pulled a small compact out of her satchel and opened it. \"Connect my voice and image through time and space to Lucila, daughter of Selena, rightful heir to the titles Diodenes of Catania, Priestess of Sekhnet, Ultimate Siren of Endor.\" At the other end of town, in Lucila's office, her glazed wall frame mirror began to shake unsteadily, it seemed like the mirror would fall off its hook at any moment. Lucila immediately stood up from her desk where she was signing some grade sheets. Holding the mirror steady with one hand she saw Bianca's real image come into view. \"We got lucky.\" Bianca began. \"I did not have to over power the child. Lucy was still here so I cast a spell upon her instead. It did not take long for me to get control of the situation.\" \"Very good. I was worried that I would have to send that useless creature on a wild goose chase just so we could separate her from Linda.\" She glanced at her watch. \"The ceremony will begin in a half hour. Do you think you can really sway the child to help us with our plans?\" \"There is no way she won't help us. Our plan is fool-proof. We shall be there before the awarding is finished.\" she closed the compact and opened the closet door. Binding Lucy's hands and mouth with duct tape, she dragged her into the garage and locked the door that led into the house. Trying to be as quiet as possible, she stood before Kali, who was kicking in her sleep and calling out for her mother. With a low voice, she called upon the; \" \"Witches great and witches wise, shield me now from watchful eyes, close this child's third eye so that she may only look at and see the image of whom I wish to be!\" Smoke billowed from beneath her feet as her transformation slowly began to take effect. Closing her eyes, she envisioned the person she wished to become. With neck length brown hair, a small build, mid-pitched voice, and an exact replica of her clothes, Bianca had transformed into the only person Kali was told to trust at that very moment, Lucy ! \"Kali, Kali...\" she slowly nudged the child to wake up. \"Ungh! Wanna sleep...\" \"Wake up Kali, your mom wants me to bring you to our school.\" \"Mommy?\" she turned over and began to wipe the sleep out of her eyes. \"Alright Aunt Lucy. I am coming. Let me change clothes first.\" **** Linda wondered what had the students talking so excitedly as she entered her college building. They were all tapping her on the back and congratulating her for something. She missed the announcement over the sound system. No school for the rest of the afternoon. Instead, a student assembly was going to be held. She joined the other students heading for the auditorium. \"Linda.\" Lucila pulled her into her office as she passed by. \"You won't be sitting with the other students. You can walk with me to the auditorium.\" \"What's going on professor?\" Linda asked as she watched Lucila take a small flask out of her desk before signaling that they should leave the room already. \"Classes have been canceled for the rest of the day. The awarding ceremony for the creative writing contest starts in 15 minutes. The winners are supposed to walk in with their creative writing professors.\" she explained as she locked the door to her office. She took a big drink from the flask and offered it to Linda. \"I won? I won!\" Linda's joyously declared. \"Yes you did. Now I want you to try this drink. It's being served at the party tonight. Even though she had apprehensions about drinking liquids offered to her by strangers, she did not want to offend her professor. She took the flask and took a small sip. \"Drink it up. Don't you like it? It's my own concoction, Raspberry juice with a hint of mango extract.\" Lucila told her, refusing to take the flask back. \"It tastes good.\" she lied. The taste reminded her of a very thick chocolate milkshake with rough crushed ice mixed into it. Swallowing it gave her an uncomfortable sensation in the throat. She felt momentarily wierded out before regaining her composure. Linda held the flask to her lips, hoping she did not have to drink the rest of it. But Lucila stopped walking and waited for her to finish the drink. \"That's more like it.\" she had a sinister glint in her eyes when she finally took the empty flask back. Linda was so busy basking in the thought of her big win that she failed to notice the look on the professor's face. \"Can we stop by the pay phone? I need to call my husband. He should be here with me.\" \"Of course.\" Lucila motioned with her head for Linda to walk on ahead. \"He should be here to witness the special treat I have in store for you and your family.\" she thought. **** Kal-El flew directly to Ethan's office. Leaving the car in the parking slot, he was Clark Kent by the time he reached the front door of the office. Everyone there was so used to seeing his cousin in law speed walking through the office that nobody paid him any attention anymore. Knocking on Ethan's office door, he turned the knob and let himself in. Ethan abruptly ended the phone call he was on. \"I hope you brought my car back.\" \"It's in the parking lot. Can you come with me? There's something I need to show you.\" \"I'm headed that way anyway. That was Kara on the phone. Her classes have been canceled for the day. She is accepting an award and she wants me to be there. It would be a treat for her if you could be there to.\" he grabbed his brown leather jacket from the back of his chair on their way out. **** The winners paraded across the auditorium stage with their respective mentors who soon left the stage after taking an honorary bow with their student. Lucila made sure that she would always be within close proximity to Linda by managing to convince the other judges to allow her to host the ceremony. Linda was beginning to wonder about the contents of the drink. there was something about the drink that made her feel physically heavy. This was a different sensation from her pregnancy symptoms. She tried to shake off the sensation by concentrating on the audience door entrance, Ethan would be walking in any minute now. In the meantime, she pretended to listen to the opening remarks of their college dean. **** \"Ethan, there are a few things you need to know about your car now.\" Kal-El began as the engine roared to life. It's okay Clark. I can understand that you need to learn how to drive.\" he assured him. \"No. It isn't that. You know I don't need to drive.\" he paused before asking Ethan to pull over. \"No, I will not pull over. We have to be at the school in 15 minutes Clark. Whatever it is can wait.\" \"But...\" \"Later. The car is running fine. Zip it.\" **** Lucy awoke as the coldness of the garage pavement began to seep into her skin. She tried to shout but then only heard a muffled sound escape from her lips. Realizing that she was gagged and bound, she kept rolling on the floor until she hit the wall. Maneuvering herself in an awkward fashion, she finally managed to get upright and then eventually into a standing position. Almost falling a few times as she skipped across the floor, she reached the sawing table of Ethan that he used for building plant boxes which he sold to his clients. Very carefully, she began rubbing the duct tape that bound her hands behind her across the protruding blade. As soon as her hands came free, she ripped off the tape from her mouth and tried to get into the house through the connecting door. Finding it locked, she hit the automatic door button and ran to the front of the house. Luckily, Bianca had not locked the door when she left with Kali. \"Kali? Kali! Karalinda!\" Lucy felt her sense of panic rising when she received no response to her calls. She hoped that her woman's intuition was wrong and Kali was not with Bianca. Only God knew what Bianca would do to the child. Kara! She needed to get to the school. Kara would know what to do. She ran out of the house and jumped into her car, burning rubber as she peeled out onto the street. **** \"Thank you for your inspiring words of wisdom Dean Stanton.\" Leighton addressed the dean as he made his way to his seat at the bottom of the stage. \"Now, we shall proceed with the awarding ceremony. Professor Chancey shall hand the winners their trophies and gift certificates from the Midvale Mall.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Linda saw Ethan and Clark walk into the room. Waving at them, she smiled and pointed them over to the seats reserved for them 3 rows away from the stage. A few awards and thank you speeches later, Linda's category was finally up for announcement. \"The next award is for the Best Science Fiction Short Story category. The winner, has written a compelling essay about the adventures of a young woman named Arak who left her home on Orga City to come to earth in search of a powerful life source which was lost to her people. While on earth, the woman learned about the dark arts, the human ways, and first love. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, one of our most promising Senior Journalism students, Ms. Linda Lee Logan.\" Professor Leighton introduced her. Standing up from her chair on the stage, she accepted the trophy from Professor Chancey. As soon as her hands grasped the statuette, Linda felt her strength being sapped out of her. Had the professor not been there to help her, she would have dropped the trophy. \"Something is wrong.\" Ethan noted as soon as he saw her almost drop the trophy. \"I know. We need to get to that trophy. I don't like the looks of this.\" Kal-El added. Before anybody knew what was happening, a hurricane force wind swept through the auditorium, crushing seats and throwing the spectators against walls and out of the door. Holding on tightly to Ethan, Kal-El super glanced around the room and saw that Leighton was standing off to a corner of the stage, seemingly entranced as chaos enveloped her surroundings. \"The professor is doing this!\" he spoke clearly into Ethan's ear. \"Kara!\" Ethan exclaimed as he saw Linda changed into her costume, using the flying debris as her cover. She tried to make her way across the stage but was thrown against the wall by the wind gusts. Taking off his necktie and belt, Kal-El secured Ethan onto the nearby steel flagpole before springing into action. \"Kara! Are you alright?\" He asked as he helped up from the heap she had landed in. \"I'm fine Kal-El. Now let's end this.\" she brushed herself off and kicked off in order to fly. She landed on the floor with a thud. \"What's happening?\" Looking back towards Ka-El, she saw him start to fall to the floor. She suddenly felt herself weakening as well. She knew what was going on. She and Kal-El were being poisoned. They needed to get away from the Kryptonite. But where was the Kryptonite? Crawling her way towards Kal-El, she lost her strength and stopped. Turning onto her back in order to help her breathe. \"Kara... The Kryptonite. Where is it? Ethan, Ethan can help us.\" he weakly whispered. Their super hearing still intact, she could only nod weakly at him and try to call out for her husband. The last image that Kara and Kal-El saw was that of the professor kneeling over Kara, holding a glowing green switchblade. \"Professor, what have you done? Why are you doing this?\" she asked through her labored breath. \"What have I done? What am I doing this? Come on Linda, or should I say Supergirl? You and Superman took the life of somebody very dear to me. I am avenging her death.\" she held the blade high above her head before finally plunging it into Kara's stomach. \"It wasn't hard to plot your destruction once I had the proper help that I needed. Bianca survived the Phantom Zone you know. with her help, I had access to the Kryptonite I needed, which is in the trophy you held, and the dust of the Phantom Zone, that sapped you of your strength. You will not survive this time Supergirl.\" Lucila laughed diabolically as she watched Kara squirming on the floor, trying to get away from the trophy that was only 2 feet away. \"This is the anathema of Selena! I will take your life in exchange for my mother's life!\" she bellowed as she twisted the dagger within. The Kryptonite, having taken its desired effect on the skin elasticity of Kara, allowed the sharp blade to cut through as if it were ripping paper apart. \"Kara!\" Ethan found the strength to break through the constraints and run to his wife's side. Lucila was long gone before he finally made it to the stage. \"Ethan... Ethan... it hurts honey. It hurts really bad. Kal-El. Look at Kal-El.\" she placed her hand over the aching part of her body. She saw her own blood on her hand. \"Kara.... Kara.... no. I'm not leaving you. This isn't supposed to happen! You are super beings!\" he felt his tears begin to swell. Feeling hopeless, he pulled Kal-El nearer to Kara's position. \"Tell me what to do Kal-El!\" \"The trophy, it's the trophy. Get rid of it.\" Grabbing the trophy from the floor, Ethan hurled it as far as he could out the broken window of the auditorium. \"What now?\" he asked Kal-El urgently. \"Take the knife out of Kara.\" \"Ethan.... I can't, I can't hold on much longer.\" Kara's voice was almost an inaudible whisper now. Taking a deep breath, knelt before his dying wife and used both hands to pull the dagger out. Blood spurted from the gaping hole and sprinkled all over his shirt. \"Dad! What have you done! What have you done?\" He heard Kali's voice from behind him. He spun around to explain to her. The bloodied dagger still in his hands. He did not notice \"Lucy\" standing off to a side of the stage. \"Kali, it's not what you think...\" \" You killed them! You killed mom and uncle Kal-El!\" Kali turned away from him and ran towards \"Lucy\". \"Kali!\" \"Ethan! Forget her. Deal with Kali later. Kara, her vital signs are weakening. I can still hear her heart beat but it is slowing down.\" Kal-El was slowly beginning to regain his strength now that the Kryptonite was out of the area. \"Damn! How do I get you both to the fortress? Can you fly Ka-El?\" \"No, no, I am too weak. This is precisely why I wanted to talk to you about your car.\" \"What about my car?\" \"Drive it to the front. Hurry.\" Kal-El slowly scrambled to his feet. \"I will try to take Kara out of here.\" \"But my car can't get to the fortress.\" \"It can and we are going to Heritage Island instead.\" Ethan stood there wondering about how exactly the car would make it to the middle of the ocean. \"Don't just stand there like an idiot! Hurry!\" **** \"Let's stay here until we are sure your father has left.\" Bianca, as Lucy suggested to the child. They entered the unlocked office of Lucila and settled in. \"I can't believe he would do that! I thought he loved us! Mom told me to believe in his love for our family! She told me that he would never do anything to hurt us!\" \"You can't believe everything your mother says Kali. You must remember, humans do not understand your kind. If they ever found out you existed, they would kill you too. \" she planted the seeds of doubt in the child's mind. \"But we are not here to hurt anybody. We are the protectors of this planet.\" Kali explained in her unique child-adult manner. \"They won't understand that. So the only thing you can do is destroy them, before they kill you like they did your mother.\" \"But mom said...\" \"Your mom is dead Kali. Your father will kill you next. You have to protect yourself because there is nobody left to protect you. I can help you destroy those who wish to destroy you. Just listen to me. I am the only one on your side now.\" **** Kal-El dragged his feet as he made his way to the front door with Kara limp in his arms. She had stopped talking and was no longer responding to the calls of her name. He heard her heart beat every other second. She was fading fast. The car spun to a stop in front of them. Jumping out of the car, he helped Kal-El load Kara into the back seat. \"Kara, talk to me honey. Hang in there. We will get you help.\" he promised. \"Get in Ethan!\" Kal-El hurried him. Slamming the door behind him, he looked wonderingly at Kal-El. \"The side panel, hold your left hand against it.\" \"Why?\" \"Just do it!\" He nervously held his left palm against the empty portion of the side panel. The car seemed to suddenly come to life. \"Super car activated. Welcome Ethan Logan. Car transformation commencing.\" a voice similar to Kara's came out of the car speakers. The steering wheel sunk into the dashboard and its place, a blue and red pilot like control wheel sporting the House of El emblem appeared for Ethan to now control the car with. The car expanded in size both in and out as it took off towards the skies. The white car was now sporting a turquoise blue paint job with red sidewall tires similar to the colors of the super clothes. The dashboard was replaced by a control panel similar to the one in Kara's hyper-pod. Everything was now voice or biometrically activated within the car. \"Transformation complete. Ready for next command.\" \"Kal-El?\" he glanced over at his passenger, unsure of what he had just witnessed. Talk about souping up his ride! Kal-El's head was resting on the window glass. \"You know where to go Ethan.\" he whispered. \"Proceed to Heritage Island.\" Ethan spoke up. \"Coordinates set. Arriving at Heritage Island in 5 minutes.\" \"That's too late. Ethan say \"Super car, activate super flight.\" Time is of the essence.\" \"Super car, activate super flight.\" Ethan commanded. \"Manual flight disengaged. Super flight activated.\" the car responded. Within a flash, the familiar dome was now appearing before them. Seemingly acknowledging the car by opening up the entry hole wide enough to accommodate the car. \"It's Kara, she's hurt. We can't stop the bleeding and she is not responding to our calls. Her heat is beating every 30 seconds.\" Kal-El reported to the images of Zor-El and Alura while Ethan got Kara out of the car and onto the examination table. \"I cannot detect any vital signs at the moment.\" Alura's holographic image declared. **** \"Lucy, is this the child you were telling me about? The daughter of Linda Logan?\" Lucila pretended to ask when she entered her office to see the child and Bianca in disguise. \"Yes she is.\" \"Is she ready like you said?\" \"She is ready.\" Kali was sitting off in a dark corner of the office mourning the loss of her mother. Her anger at her father eating away at her inside. She wanted nothing more than the avenge her mother's death. Humans would pay. She would make sure of it and she would start with the man who caused her mother and she all this pain, her father.[Chapter 16] The Turning Of Kali Thentown was in a state of panic as news spread across the town aboutnthe inexplicable tornado that hit the community college. People werentrying to leave town as severe storm clouds gathered over thenhorizon. The gusty winds were beginning to cause steady rainfall thatnseemed to get stronger by the hour. Hurricane like winds were takingnout the power and phone lines. Nobody realized that black magick wasnat work courtesy of Lucila and Bianca. People were panicking andnsearching for guidance and leadership. The townsfolk all had the samenquestion on their lips. Where was Supergirl? Why was she not helpingnthem? What had they done to cause her to forsake them? Safenwithin the confines of the carnivalnfun-house, the two women watched, a highly pleased look on theirnfaces, as the child worked herself into a grieving frenzy. Bynallowing her to lose control of her emotions, she would fall directlynunder their control. \"Gonahead Kali, release your emotions. Get angry! Throw things if younwant to. Destroying things will help you feel better.\" Biancanencouraged the child. Encouragednby the words of the person whom she thought was her aunt Lucy, Kalinpickednup the flimsy looking dining table and ripped it in half with hernbare hands. She was panting heavily. Obviously trying to control hernemotions and strength like Kara had taught her. \"I want to confrontnmy father! He may have gotten away with shunning me, but I will notnlet him get away with killing my mom! He will pay with his own lifen!\" she declared angrily. Neither of the womennstopped her when she picked up the glass of milk Lucila had given hernto help her calm down and hurled it across the room. The glassnshattered. Milk created a white puddle in the middle of the floor.nBianca went to get a mop to clean it up. Lucila smiled and noddednat Bianca. Kali was now ready to subconsciously do their bidding.nWith Supergirl and Superman finally dead, nobody stood in their waynanymore. Finally her mother's dream would become a reality. TodaynMidvale, tomorrow the world ! **** Kara'snunmoving body lay on the cold slab where she had given birth to Kali.nThe laser pointers continuously scanned her from head to foot.nStrange looking hoses and pipes seemed to magically appear from thenceiling and connected to her through her temples, nose, and mouth. Ethan was sitting withnKal-El in the chamber. Waiting for the results of the tests. Neithernof the men could believe that Kara could be killed that easily. Itnwas impossible! She was Supergirl ! She was of the House Of El. Shendid not scare easily and could not easily be beaten by simple humanntactics. Even if it was Kyrptonite that she was stabbed with. Karanwas not the kind to go without a fight. No, she wasn't dead.nSomething deep within them told them to believe it. Kara was notndead. She couldn't be. \"Analysisncomplete. Kara is neither dead nor alive. She is in a state ofncryogenic freeze created by her mind to help preserve her life forcenand restrict loss of blood.\" The voice of Alura explained to them. \"Is it possible tonwake her or does she have to pull out of this state on her own?\"nKal-El asked. He held Ethan back with one hand to prevent him fromnrunning into the sanitized chamber. The last thing they needed wasnfor Kara to pick up an infection. Although her stab woundnlooked visibly healed, she still needed a few hours before even thendeepest recesses of her body's flesh could totally heal itself. Atnthis point of her recuperation, she was still prone to picking upnhuman borne viruses which could mutate in her body and cause her tonfall deathly ill. \"Inwant to be with her Kal-El!nIknow that she needs me. I can sense it.\" Ethan tried to removenthe hand that was holding him in place. \"No Ethan! We neednto be careful. She isn't dead now, but she will be if younaccidentally infect her.\" Kal-El explained, loosening his gripnon Ethan's shoulder. \"Incan't be here justnwatching her die! We can't all be helpless. There has to be somethingnI can do. Something we can do for her!\" Blood seeped out of hisnknuckles after his fist made hard contact with the solid wall of thenholding room. \"Then shut up andnlet me handle this. Talk to me Alura.\" Kal-El continuedndiscussing with the computer. It took a few more minutes before thenvoice of Kara's mother was heard once again. \"All of ournmedical procedures have been completed. She should be awake and lucidnby now. Our sensors indicate that she is fighting the wake upnprocedure. She does not want to wake up. She has locked herself in anstate of past awareness. Refusing to come to the present.\" \"We have to pull hernout of it. What is the procedure for manual over ride of the wake upnprocess?\" Kal-El wanted to know as Ethan stood up and leaned hisnhead against the glass wall that divided them from the woman he wouldngive his own life for if asked. \"There is a way.nHowever, it is a far dangerous procedure as it requires thenparticipant to come to the point of death himself in order to speaknto the other's psyche.\" \"Prepare the cryonchamber. I will do it.\" Kal-El commanded. \"No you won't. She'snmy wife. I will save her.\" Ethan countered. \"You might notnsurvive... your physical composition is not made to withstand thenextreme temperatures that Kyrptonians are used to.\" \"For Kara and mynfamily, I will survive anything.\" Ethan held his hand up to thenbiometric scanner that opened the door to the isolation chamber. A horizontal metal drum,nsimilar in look and set up to an iron lung, slowly rose from thenfloor. The cold smoke coming from its bottom reminded Ethan of drynice when mixed with water. He burned his fingers when he tried tontouch the zero temperature chamber. \"Don'tnbe a fool Ethan. There is no way you will survive this.\" Kal-Elnwarned him. \"This is not like the strength of 10 Kryptonian men.nThere is no magickalnway for you to survive this if you make a mistake.\" \"Is this what I amnsupposed to wear?\" Ethan picked up a burlap looking fleshncolored gown hanging from the side of the chamber. Not even waitingnfor an answer, he began to undress and change into the clothes he hadnfound. \"Ethan! Are younlistening to me?\" Kal-El demanded. \"Kal-El! You wouldndo the same thing if it were Lois in this position! She is my wife,nmy love, my other half. I am nothing without her! You have to acceptnthe fact that there are going to be times when I will have to step upnto the plate. You cannot always be there for Kara, but I can!\"nEthan pleaded with his cousin in law as he tried to figure out how tonget the drum open. Realizingnthe truth in Ethan's words, Kal-El helped him with the finalnpreparations before henlay down within the chamber. The door automatically sealed andnpressurized when Ethan lay on the icy slab. All bio sensors wentnonline as the temperature within began to rapidly fall. \"Remember,nyou both have to be awake in an hour or you are both dead.\"nKal-El'snvoice entered the chamber through the built in communications device. \"We'llnbe out in 45 minutes.\" Ethan replied confidently as he lowerednhis protective goggles before covering himself up in a silver blanketnsimilar to the one Jor-El had wrapped the infant Kal-El in beforenjettisoning his pod to Earth. Thenlow andnsteady humming sound of the chamber indicated that everything wasnfunctioning normally. Ethan's vital signs came on-screen. His bodyntemperature began to slowly lower to a cryo freeze state. Kal-Elnheard him shivering over the speakers. He soon sounded like he was innsevere pain, his body rhythm became erratic before finally settlingndown. Ethan was now in a self induced comatose state just like Kara. \"Donyou think he will survive?\" Kal-El askednas he monitored the sensors. \"The Prince Consortnof the House Of El cannot fail.\" Zor-El's voice answered. \"What did you callnhim?\" Kal-El asked in surprise. **** Kali finally succumbed tonsleep after releasing only a portion of her anger upon the fun-house.n Although the bed had different sheets and was now in a differentnpart of the fun-house, it was still the same bed where Selena hadnbound Ethan with chains in the past. How ironic it was that hisndaughter now lay on the bed, under the spell of a witch as well. They placed an enchantednblack candle at every corner of the bed, being careful not to wakenher as they lit each of the wicks. The candles signified the girlsndesire to take the lives of those who had wronged them. Next, theynencompassed the bed in a circle using the remaining sand from thenphantom zone. An act which they hoped would allow them total controlnover the child and her powers. When everything was finally in place,nBianca walked over to the loose floorboard in the room and producednNigel's old Burundi wand. They clasped their handsntogether over the wand and began to chant ; \"Forces ofndarkness heed our pleas, Grant us total controlnover this child and her powers. Allow her wrath tonblind her senses and emotions So that she shallnwillingly do our bidding, and destroy those whomnwe dictate upon her. Kali, Goddess ofndestruction Heed our plea. Bring to fore thenhatred this child feels, allowing us to use itnto our advantage in all our deeds.\" A flash of lightningnwithin the room was followed by a strong air current that rained thendust particles unto the body of Kali. \"Are you sure thisnwill work? The Phantom Zone dust is supposed to bind her powers.\"nLucila asked as the dust settled and seemed to be absorbed by thenchild's skin. \"The wiccans of ArgonCity and Krypton were very specific. She had been telling them allnabout the Burundi wand and its pure evil powers and how she had usednit to defeat Supergirl once. They taught her that such things cannfurther be strengthened by the use of the Phantom Zone dust upon thenEl's. They developed that spell together a few days before shenescaped the Phantom Zone. We will have full control of her when shenawakes. It is the spell we cast which shall change the effects of thensand upon the child.\" Bianca confided as she withdrew thencurtains to let the full moonlight in. \"The child shall benunder our full influence.\" \"How soon can wenbegin?\" Lucila asked excitedly. She was eager to get on with thendestruction of Midvale and her assumption to the magickal titles thatnher mother once held. \"Let the child sleepnfor now. We can wake her after we have finalized our plan of attack.\" **** He awoke covered in ancloud of smoke. Coughing heavily as he stood up, he felt like he hadnhust pulled out of a severe bout of Sleep Apnea. Where was he? takingnsmall steps as he got his bearings, he found himself in a place thatnreminded him of a futuristic eutopia. As he approached whatnseemed to be the center if the premises, he came across a little boynrunning towards a group of other youths who seemed to be studying anpiece of neo-art which was magically created by a tall and lankyncaucasian man of indeterminable age. \"Woah! Can you tellnme where I am?\" he caught the boy by the shoulder of hisnclothing. The boy squirmed left andnright trying to get away. \"Let me go! I'm late for class! ComingnZaltar!\" the boy hollered towards the lanky man who was dressedndifferently from the rest. \"Zaltar?\" Ethannwondered as the boy broke free. The man was holding a stick andndrawing through the air. The next thing he knew, the statue of antrain was standing before the group. As the children gazed on innamazement, the man animatedly gave a talk on the steam train as anform of human transport \"The Matterwand!\"nEthan gasped. He suddenly realized where he was. \"It can't be.nBut could it? No way! Is this Argo City?\" If this was indeed Argoncity, where was Kara? Why would she choose to come back to the placenthat had brought her nothing but unhappiness? More importantly, hownwould he find her here? How would he make his way around the city? **** \"Lucy! Where thenhell have you been? I have been worried sick about you! Hurry, helpnme pack up!\" Jimmy barked as Lucy walked into their apartmentnwith a worried look on her face. She had spent the whole day tryingnto find Linda, Ethan, and Kali to no avail. The city was alreadynexperiencing the first stages of a hurricane storm and Jimmy wasnalready in disaster preparedness mode. \"Jimmy, did you seenLinda or Ethan today? Did you see them anywhere?\" sheninterrupted him as he hurriedly packed their pantry supplies into anpicnic basket. \"No, even Clark wasnMIA today. Lois is trying to find him because the people may needntheir help to survive this hurricane.\" he replied with a note ofnirritation in his voice. \"Don't worry about them. They will bensafe. Us on the other hand...\" \"I lost Kali.\"nLucy confessed. \"Bianca took her.\" Jimmy froze upon hearingnher words. \"How exactly does one go about losing a super childnLucy? And what is this about Bianca? She died in the Phantom Zonenages ago.\" \"She survived Jimmy.nYou gotta believe me. When Kali was screaming Monster, she meant thatnshe was seeing Bianca in disguise.\" Lucy felt like kickingnherself for not listening to the child when she could have. Now itnwas too late. \"Lucy...\" \"Jimmy, I am tellingnyou, Bianca took Kali. We need to find her parents and tell them.nOnly Kara can get her back.\" \"First we get tonsafety and wait for this storm to pass.\" Jimmy advised. \"No! We need to findnher before the storm!\" Lucy headed out the door and into thencrazy weather. \"Lucy! It's toondangerous! Come back!\" Jimmy grabbed his raincoat and followednher into the treacherous night weather conditions. **** His search for Kara lednhim to the higher floors of the city. In what seemed to be thenresidential area, he came across a group of people who seemed to bendoing some sort of yoga based exercise. \"Hello citizen,nwould you care to join us?\" one of the young and robust teenagenmen in the group invited him. \"Oh, no thank you. Inam looking for Kara.\" he responded. Hoping that the person wouldnnot notice that he spoke differently from them. For some strangenreason, this man seemed familiar to Ethan. Had they met before?nImpossible. He had never even heard of Argo City until he met Kara anfew years ago. Yet somehow... \"Kara is a verynenergetic woman. She is never in one place long enough to be found.\"nthe man explained. \"Even I have a hard time keeping track of hernnow that we are promised to each other.\" \"Promised to eachnother?\" Ethan wondered aloud. Did the term mean the same thingnon Argo City as it did on earth? \"Where have you beennhiding citizen? The Princess Kara has been betrothed to me since wenwere born under the same moon.\" Ethan felt jealousy buildnup within him. Was this all a dream? Was Kara really involved withnsomeone else before him? Why had she never told him? He hoped that henwould still have this memory when he awoke. This was something henfelt that he needed to know about. \"Kara can marry younif she wishes to. Your parents arranged it after all. But I doubt shenwould want to marry such a pompous and self centered being such asnyou of her own free will Olrac.\" a man with what Ethan thoughtnwas a hint of a British accent spoke from behind him. He turnednaround to see Zaltar, his Matterwand in hand. \"Be on your way. Inshall assist the citizen in finding Kara.\" he dismissed thenyoung man with a wave of his hand, boredom evident in his voice. \"You must benZaltar.\" \"And you are Ethan.nI know who you are.\" Zaltar surprised him. \"You know me?\" \"I knew you wouldnfollow Kara. I have been hiding her since you got here. She isnashamed to present herself to you.\" \"Wait a minute. Whatnis going on here? Why do you know me? Are her memories all mixed up?\"nEthan wondered. \"She is trying tonkeep you away. That is why you are seeing her secrets. She doesn'tnwant you to come after her. She feels she has failed to live up tonher promise. That is why she has not awoken.\" \"But we need her tonwake up. Her daughter needs her, I need her.\" Ethan pleaded withnZaltar. \"Ethan, she has doneneverything you have asked of her and yet you have done very little tonunderstand her. \" \"What are yountalking about? I have always understood her.\" \"It is best that thentwo of you talk this over. Come with me.\" Zaltar took his handnand, in what seemed to be the blink of an eye, they were inside annenormous hall. Kara sat at the end of a very long table. Intentlynstudying crystal tubes. \"Where are we?\"nEthan whispered, not wanting to disturb Kara. \"The Hall ofnLearning.\" Zaltar responded. \"Why is she here?\" \"Ask her yourselfnEthan.\" Zaltar pushed him towards Kara. She seemed to sense theirnpresence in the room. Looking up from the crystals, her facenregistered a sad smile on her face. \"You followed me.\" shenstood up and turned her back to him. She pretended to choose otherncrystals for her studies. Ethan turned to look atnZaltar who had disappeared into thin air. \"What were younexpecting me to do?\" he came closer and turned her around tonface him. \"I failed you Ethan.nI don't deserve to live. Leave me here. In this state.\" \"You are talkingncrazy! How did you fail me?\" he demanded. \"I promised you Inwould not allow myself to be fatally harmed, and yet Prof. Leightonnwas able to get to me. \"Forget that! Younare healed Kara. All the analysis proves it. You have to wake up!\" \"You were right.nKali needs to be normal. She needs a parent who isn't going to takencrazy risks like I do.\" \"Will you stop it!nCome back Kara! We need you!\" \"I should havenstayed on Argo City...\" \"Stop talking crazy!nYou can't live in this figment of your imagination forever! EvennZaltar knows that.\" \"He wasn't supposednto bring you to me!\" she began to break down. Her voice wasngiving away her emotions now. \"Why not? Becausenyou regret having married me? Do you prefer to stay with Orlac now?nDo you think things would have been different if you married himninstead?\" Ethan was just being hurtful now. \"Orlac is a part ofnmy life that you will never understand because you never ever showednan interest in learning about my past. The life I had before I wasnthrust into a role I never asked for! Now leave me where I am most atnpeace! Where I am among my familiars!\" Kara pushed him away sonshe could pass. \"The only place I amn going to leave you in is over in the real world with me!\" hengrabbed her with all the strength he could muster to keep her by hisnside. \"Ethan let me go! Inam setting you free! Let me be! Find somebody who can give you thensecurity and family life you always wanted. I can't do it! I can't benthe person you need me to be and still be the person I am destined tonbe. Try to understand. I am doing what is best for us, for Kali.\" \"How is leaving Kalinwithout a mother what is best for her? What do you think will happennto her without you? I can't raise her without you. The 3 of us, wenare the family I always wanted. I know that now. I don't want anyonenelse Kara! It's you I love. Sure our family life isn't ever going tonbe perfect. You will always take risks with your life. But that isnwho you are and I can't change that. But, if you will give me anchance, I can learn to accept it. Just as I learned to accept thatnKali will never be the kind of daughter who will need me to scare herndates into treating her right. That Kali will never be the kind ofndaughter who will run to Daddy asking him to defend her because shencan do that herself. I am going to understand everything in duentime.\" he tried to reason with her. \"Ethan!\" shenwas about to say something else when an ear piercing shrill soundnpierced the walls of the hall. \"Stop it the two ofnyou!\" Zaltar suddenly appeared before them. \"What in the blazesnis that?\" Ethan screamed. \"Kara, you must gonback. Stop wallowing in self pity! You are better than this. You neednto rely on your inner strength. Trust that it will never fail you.nRemember when we were in the Phantom Zone? What was it that I toldnyou then?\" Zaltar asked her as he struggled to be heard over thennerve wracking sound. \"That you shallnalways be with me?\" she answered. \"And always with younI shall be!\" he shoved a bunch of crystals into Ethan's handnforced a large crystal box that held the Matterwand into Kara'snpossession. \"Now, go my children! There are lives that need tonbe saved!\" **** The emergency sensorsnwere going wild all over the island control center. Midvale was undernattack by unknown forces. The city was being attacked by storm surgesnand fires were erupting all over the city. Kal=El was working doublentime to find the source of the strikes that seemed to be naturenbased. \"Zor-El, I need morenpower. Something is blocking the sensors.\" Kal-El ordered. \"I have given younall available power sources Kal-El. Until Ethan and Kara awake, Inneed to reserve the power that keeps the cryo freezers operational.\" \"How many morenminutes till the deadline?\" \"Ethan hasnapproximately 10 minutes before his body falls into an irreversiblenstate of hypothermia.\" \"Dammit! He told menthey would be out of there in 45 minutes!\" Kal-El returned tonthe medical area to check on the couple. Ethan's cryo-freezer wasnundergoing its defrosting procedure at the very moment that Kal-Elnstepped in. He quickly checked on Kara who was slowly coming to asnwell. She was still weak, but already alert. \"Where is the attackncoming from?\" she wanted to know. Her voice was only slightlynabove a whisper. \"That is what we arentrying to figure out.\" Kal-El responded. \"Kal-El, thensituation is worse. People need to be taken to higher ground.\"nAlura's voice interrupted. He turned to his cousinnfor help. \"Do you think you can fly now?\" \"I need to energizenfirst.\" she meant that she needed to fly directly into thencenter of the sun in order to reboot her super powers. \"I'll help. I'llntake the supercar. \" Ethan volunteered. He was still shiveringnfrom his frozen experience. The crystals Zaltar had handed him lay onnthe slab he had just gotten up from. \"What are those?nWhere did you get it?\" Kal-El asked. \"Zaltar gave them tonme. Where's the Matterwand\" Ethan asked Kara. \"It's somewherenhere.\" she was still disoriented when she replied. \"Source of attacksnpinpointed. Placing it on the monitor now.\" Zor-El cleared outnthe medical sensor screen in the clinic and replaced it with a realntime video of a place that was all too familiar to Kara. Standing at the highestnpoint of the roller coaster track stood Prof. Leighton and Bianca,nbetween then, bound in chains and a headpiece that reminded everyonenof a lighting rod stood a crazed looking Kali. \"Kali! No! What havenyou done!\" Kara cried out, her knees buckling under her. Kal-Elncaught her just in time. \"I need tonrecuperate.\" Kara urgently told them as she regained hernbalance. \"You do what younhave to do honey. I'll go help the townsfolk as best as I can.nKal-El, stay here and monitor the situation. I will need your help. Inhave no idea what the car can do.\" \"Alright. The car isnsimple enough to use, but you need to get used to it first. Kara,njoin Ethan as soon as you can.\" \"Lucy! What aboutnLucy, Jimmy, and Lois?\" Kara worried. \"I'll find them.\"nEthan assured her. \"Now go get well.\" She was just about to flynoff towards the dome chute when Ethan held her hand tightly. He didnnot notice what she did. That he was able to fight her strength.nTurning around, he gave her the most loving kiss that he couldnmuster. \"Don't worry honey,nwe'll get through this. We will get our daughter back.\" henwhispered assuringly into her ear. \"I hope you're rightnEthan. I would hate to think of what we might need to do to savenKali.\"[Chapter 17] Zaltar's Crystals The Honda subcompact which was now in Super-car mode pitched from side to side as Ethan did his best to maneuver it safely through the lighting bolts and claps of thunder that seemed to be assaulting him from all sides. He felt more secure about his decision to assist Kara and Kal-El before he left the island. Now that he was almost in the thick of the action, he was almost certain that he was losing his nerve. He jumped at every clap of thunder and found himself shaking all over with every lightning bolt that seemed to enter the car from the exposed windows. He flicked on the rear-view communicator panel in near panic. Was Kal-El absolutely sure the car could withstand all of the extreme conditions it was faced with? After all, the car was only a made in Japan from human technology. Souping it up the way Kal-El did did not exactly make him very confident since he did not understand Kyrptonian science. \"Relax Ethan. That car is the safest place to be in Midvale right now. It can withstand a 500 megaton nuclear blast.\" Kal-El assured him. \"I'm not so sure about that. \" Ethan's body shook as a lighting bolt seemed to pass directly inside the car cabin. \"Do you want me to drop a nuclear bomb on you to prove my point?\" Kal-El asked jokingly. \"No!\" Ethan bellowed. \"Not cool man.\" \"Sit back and let the on-board computer take over until you get your nerve back.\" he suggested to his obviously panicking cousin in law. \"I'm more of a hands on driver...\" \"You've got more things to worry about than driving or flying that car right now. Pull up the emergency situations list and see which ones you should prioritize.\" \"How do that I do that?\" Ethan wondered aloud. The control panel in front of him was all touch screen and in English but with all the buttons, everything just seemed to be in Greek to him. \"Talk to the computer.\" \"Oh right. Okay.\" Ethan switched off the communicator for the time being. \"Computer, I need the list of emergency situations. In order of priority and accessibility.\" \"Collating list. Please wait.\" the computer replied. Within moments the long list of emergency scenarios began to scroll before him on the windshield monitor. God it was a long list! A fire at the oil depot, the water dam showing signs of strain and cracking, a storm surge at the breakwater, floodwaters rising, people sitting on the roofs of their homes, hoping to be evacuated to safety... How was it possible for these two super-beings to be able to attend to all of these situations all at the same time? \"You can't help them all Ethan. You have to prioritize and help who you can. Then hope that everyone else can hang in there till you get to them.\" Kal-El's voice came over the speakers. Was he a mind reader? How did he manage to read Ethan's thoughts? \"Okay. How do I do that?\" \"The computer...\" \"Oh right! I keep forgetting. Sorry. Computer, calculate our proximity to the nearest emergency situation then set your coordinates for that location.\" \"The Midvale map indicates that the closest emergency situation you can respond to is the oil depot fire. The winds have caused the blaze to reach Delta status. Workers have been evacuated. However, the flames are spreading like wildfire and threatens to set fire to Midvale Forest.\" the computer indicated. \"Then that is where we will go.\" Ethan ordered. **** Kara was flying slowly towards the Earth's atmosphere. She was still severely weakened by the stabbing and was trying to conserve her strength by flying at a tempered pace towards the sun. She hoped that the direct exposure to the power source of the super beings would jump start her healing process and allow her to concentrate on getting her daughter back from Bianca and Lucila at the soonest possible time. She was also worried that Ethan had gotten in over his head with all this rescue business because Kal-El had given him a new toy to go pretend to be a super-being in. What was Kal-El thinking when he did that? Ethan was most certainly not a Kryptonian and no amount of bells and whistles that he could install in the car would change that. Her skin began to turn a roasted shade of red as she approached the heat source. Without a second thought, she put more effort into her flying and, forcing herself into a standing position, allowed the sun's gravitational pull to suck her into its inner core. The healing and energizing was practically instantaneous. It took only moments for her to return to \"normal\", in the sense of every Kryptonian being. She was now well on her way back to Earth. If Ethan can only keep his wits above him just a little longer, she would soon be able to take over from him. **** \"Lucy! We have to turn back! The floodwater is rising too fast. \" Jimmy grabbed hold of her as they slipped and slid over the knee high waters that threatened to knock them any minute. \"No! Not without Kali! I have to find her! She is my responsibility!\" she tried to make herself heard over the sudden whistling gust of wind. \"You don't even know where to start looking!\" Jimmy reasoned. \"Besides, a super child can very well take care of herself!\" \"You don't understand! I lost her! I let Bianca take her!\" \"What? What do you mean? Bianca has been dead for years!\" The floodwater was chest high now. Jimmy was beginning to feel a panic attack coming on. \"Just that! She didn't die! She got out of the Phantom Zone! She was in Kara's house! She was the baby sitter!\" \"How did that happen? Wait! Shouldn't we be telling Kara about this?\" \"Yeah Jimmy. How do you propose we find them? From what you told me, Kara and Kal-El have their hands full. We have to find her ourselves.\" \"But where? Do we even know where Bianca might be hiding?\" \"There is only one place I can think of. The abandoned fair grounds. It was never really demolished. She could still be there.\" The floodwaters are now slightly above their chest. \"I guess we'll have to swim for it.\" Jimmy took Lucy's hand and dove into the murky floodwater. Oh the things he did for the super-beings. **** The oil depot fire was raging out of control by the time There were still a few people trapped within the premises. Ethan's car hovered over the fire as he watched the panic unfolding within the blaze that was threatening to engulf the forest within 10 minutes, he wondered what he could do to put the fire out. Would it be possible for him to evacuate the people as well? \"Computer, do you have any water on-board?\" \"Water is on-board. However, water cannot put out a gasoline based fire. My data indicates that the best course of action would be to suffocate the fire.\" \"Right. Suffocation. With what?\" Kal-El appeared on-screen at that exact moment. \"Ethan, use the suction function of the car exhaust. It's the red button in the uppermost right hand panel.\" \"Thanks for letting me know.\" he did as instructed. \"What about the people Kal-El?\" \"Do you see the manual gearshift?\" Kal-El had converted the stick shift to serve a higher purpose than just speeding up the car. \"Push it forward. It will lower a rescue basket. Pulling the shift pulls the basket up to a safe point. You can let them out wherever you think they will be safe.\" The rescue efforts of Ethan went like this for a couple of hours as he learned how to use the on-board gadgets under Kal-El's tutelage. He felt his adrenalin pumping during the whole time. He felt useful, in the game, and even, dare he say it? Super. The grateful cries of thanks from below seemed to feed him the energy and confidence he needed to complete the task before him. For the first time in a very long time, he felt very good about himself. **** \"Ethan, I have Lucy and Jimmy on the monitor. They are in trouble. Near drowning in the vicinity of the abandoned fair grounds.\" Kal-El informed the hero in training. \"I'm on it. Computer...\" \"I am receiving the data now. Proceeding to new location.\" The floodwaters had now reached the rooftop of most of the single floor houses and establishments. The pair were all wet and scared as they sat on the rooftop of Popeye's. \"I-I-I t-t-t-old you this was a bad idea\" Jimmy's teeth were chattering. \"S-s-s-sorry, I just wanted to do the right thing.\" Lucy said before hearing the roar of a powerful motor overhead. The supercar created its own waves in the running flood waters. \"What the hell is that.?\" Jimmy pointed to the car as it came to a hover over their exact spot. It seemed to be low, too low for comfort. Before they could even try to understand what was going on, a hatch opened in the bottom of the car. Ethan's face was worriedly staring down at them. \"What the hell were the two of you thinking?!\" he admonished them as he held out his hand to help Lucy and then Jimmy into the car. **** Kara flew purposefully towards the abandoned fair grounds. Her daughter needed her help and she had to stop whatever plans Lucila and Bianca had in store for the town. From what she could tell, they seemed to be hell-bent on eradicating Midvale from the U.S. map. Kal-El had just finished mentally reporting the most recent events to her. Time was of the essence. Kali had to be stopped before their town became the next Atlantis. She closed her eyes as she flew and visualized her daughter. Trying to complete the mental connection that all the El's had with each other. Kali was still a child by human standards but everything else about her was pure El. She had nothing but the highest confidence that her daughter would be able to weed out any excess thoughts and voices in her head and be able to hear her. **** Somewhere in the deep recesses of her mind, Kali began to hear her mother's voice. Seemingly coming from a deep hole in space. She tried to block out the voices of Bianca and Lucila which were controlling her actions. Could her mother be alive after all? \"Mom, is that you? Where are you? Why can I hear you?\" the child shut her eyes tightly in order to force her concentration. \"Kali, what have you done? Why are you helping these people? They are evil. Why are you hurting the people we swore to protect?\" \"Aunt Lucy said daddy killed you and that when the people find out who I am and what I can do, they will kill me too.\" \" Aunt Lucy? Kali, Lucy would never say such a thing.\" \"Yes she did. She is right here. I can ask her. \" \"She can't be with you Kali. Your father just saved her from drowning in this storm that your anger has created.\" \"Kali, who are you talking to?\" The voice of \"Aunt Lucy\" broke through her mental connection to Kara. \"Mommy.\" the child replied. \"She isn't dead.\" \"Don't be silly child. She is dead. You saw your father kill her yourself.\" \" I don't know what to believe.\" the child whined out of confusion. \"Kali, listen to mommy, she isn't Lucy. Remember the monster you always saw in the house?\" Kara was now desperate to get her child out of the mental clutches of the witch. \"That person is Aneles. Her real name is Bianca. Fight her Kali. Don't let her control you.\" \"I don't.... Ouch! My head! Pain! Can't handle the pain! Too much! Mommy! Help me!\" Kali was slowly coming out of the control of Bianca and Lucila. The pain was meant to be the witches defense mechanism. It was supposed to break the child's spirit and allow them to continue to control her thoughts and powers. \"Kali! Listen to me, listen to me!\" Just at that moment, the mother felt her mental connection broken with her daughter. She leaned into her flying even more. Nobody can hurt her daughter and get away with it. **** Having safely deposited Lucy and Jimmy on the island, Ethan was ready to head back to Midvale. But Kal-El stopped him before he could board the car. \"What now?\" Ethan's nerves were frayed from all the chaos that was going on and the fact that nobody seemed to know how to get his daughter back from her captors. Kal-El held out a half circular tube that had lenses in the middle. The sides of the tube were slim and contoured. \"For you to wear on the missions.\" He took the contraption and stared at it. Unsure about what the exact purpose of the item was. Where was he supposed to wear it? \"Remember, I wear glasses so nobody can recognize me? It's made from the same material. Only you have to wear it during your missions.\" Kal-El smiled at him. \"Missions?\" \"You are a part of this family are you not?\" Kal-El's voice held a note of seriousness in it. \"Yes. But I am not sure....\" \"You will eventually get used to it. Don't worry, we won't let you fail. You are the best back up we can have.\" he reassured the worried looking Ethan. \"Does Kara know?\" \"She will. \" He slipped the glasses on and his face immediately changed in contour. Even his voice changed to a higher pitched tone. \"I'm off.\" he gave Kal-El a mock salute before closing the car door. **** \"Kal-El, I need your help. Kali is being hurt.\" Kara tried to connect to Kal-El's mind. \"I know Kara. I can see everything on the monitor. Ethan is on his way.\" \"Ethan??? He is not prepared! Why did you have to get him involved Kal-El?\" \"There is a higher purpose in store for him. He has to earn it Kara.\" Kal-El had been appraised by Zor-El and Alura as to why he was addressed as Prince Consort. Kara had no idea about what was going on at the island yet. \"What is going on there Kal-El?\" \"You will find out soon enough. Now go get your daughter back and get this weather back on track.\" **** The witches were ready to have a face off with Supergirl. They would use her weakness on her, the child. The pain that Kali had been feeling earlier only escalated in discomfort so that it reached the point where the child had no other choice but to pass out from the pain. As soon as she did, Lucila cast a sleeping spell on the child to keep her in her weakened state without waking. They soon saw Supergirl flying closer to the roller coaster tracks. Using her mother's wand, Lucila recited the Floating spell that she had found in her mother's journals. the body of Kali began to float in mid-air like a puppet on a string. Flying directly for her daughter, Kara was not prepared for what happened next. \"One child times two, Two children times infiniti, Never will the original child be found.\" Pointing her wand directly at the child, a silver spark of light struck Kali and produced an innumerable number of copies of Kali. All of whom where knocked out and being manipulated through the air like paper planes. Each time Supergirl flew closer, Lucila would release one of the mirror images, sending the mother flying down after it. Only to have it vanish into thin air. Just as Kara was beginning to feel defeated, the super-car showed up. Ethan had been monitoring the situation from the surveillance screen in the car. This was one job that would require both the car, himself, and Kara to handle. But in order to actually be able to help his wife, he would need to be able to fly. Kal-El never mentioned anything about him being able to fly. At that very moment, the crystals Zaltar had handed him while he was in Argo City materialized, now on necklaces made of a clear material appeared on the dashboard. Zaltar's voice filled the cockpit. \"The crystals of power are given to the man who proves to be the equal of the Princess of the House Of El in every way. You have proven to be that man for Kara Ethan. As such, you are allowed to emulate Kryptonian powers whenever needed. Use the crystals carefully. You have been entrusted with a super human task.\" The voice of Zaltar spoke to him out of nowhere. \"What? I don't understand. Zaltar, what are you saying?\" Ethan was getting used to talking to these disembodied voices already. \"You need to fly. Take a crystal and place it around your neck. Tell the crystal what power you need and it shall be granted for an hour. Remember, you will need one crystal for every power you will require.\" Zaltar's voice trailed off. Without thinking twice, Ethan took a necklace and draped it on his neck, Pressing the button that opened the roof hatch of the car, he set the car on auto pilot with preset instructions then zoomed out of the car. \"You're flying!\" Kara exclaimed upon seeing him. \"But how?\" \"Zaltar. Long story. Tell you later. You handle the witches, I will get Kali.\" he instructed his wife. He wondered where he got the confidence to order Kara around. He felt and knew that he was changing. He just did not know if it was his paternal instinct or if it had anything to do with all the bells and whistles the El's seemed to be giving him lately. Kara immediately flew upward towards the witches. The car flew directly into the crowd of Kali's, dissipating each of the illusions until only the real Kali was left. In retaliation, Lucila sent the child plummeting to the ground. Ethan flew after the child and urgently grasped her in his arms. Kali was now safely ensconced in her father's embrace. The car came around and opened the hatch for them to enter. He flew the car back towards the island, leaving Kara to take down the witches.[Chapter 18] The Matterwand Kara had a definite feeling that she was flying into a battlezone wherein she was set up to lose. She was now up against 2 witches whose knowedge of the magickal ways far outnumbered the little information that Zaltar was able to impart to her once upon a time. All she had to back her up was her strength, logic, and the desire to end the fued that Lucila was never supposed to have been involved in. She could see the smugness on Bianca's face as she stood behind the woman who was once her teacher and mentor. Kara coul not help but wonder about how everything was going to end. Kal-El and she had banished Selena back to the Phantom Zone in the past. Now that the prison for all that was evil in their world had been destroyed, what were her options? She had no desire to inflict pain upon this woman. Lucila was someone whom she respected. It would not have made any difference to her who Lucila's mother was for she believed that the sins of the parent should never be taken out on the children. If only Bianca had not turned her evil... If only they had not gone after Kali... If only they were not currently trying to destroy Midvale... Bianca no longer hid her disfigured image from the world. She viewed the young hero with disdain as the image inched closer to where they stood at the top of the tracks. Consumed by the thought that the time for revenge had come, she raised her hands and, in the blink of an eye, streamed a steady flow of fire towards Supergirl. Kara's hair was partly singed as she made her way between the firewave. The flames were landing on the wet structures in the carnival. The intense heat caused the wet wooden structures to become tinder. A quick look back on Kara's part showed her that the town could be engulfed in fames if she did not act fast. \"What are you doing? We never agreed on burning down the town!\" Lucila angrily tried to stop Bianca. With each raise of her hand the fire seemed to be swallowing the floodwaters. In its place was a wave of fire that nobody would be able to escape. Kara made an instantaneous decision to forego the battle and help the people instead. She did her best to evacuate them to safety but she could only help so many people at a time. She was distracted and no longer concentrating on protecting herself. \"Now Lucila! She is at her most vulnerable. Strike her!\" Bianca influenced her companion. Lucila felt a tinge of guilt as the results of their rampage dawned upon her. Was she really this evil person? Did she have it within her to kill innocents in cold blood as Bianca was currently doing? Was it right to avenge Selena's death by taking more lives? \"Lucila!\" Bianca warned. \" I can't do it.\" came her weak reply. \"What?\" \"I can't kill her. I can't kill these people!\" she declared forcefully. *** Ethan stroked his unconscious daughter's hair as the car flew them to safety. What ever made him think that he could have turned his back on her? The child had suffered emotional trauma because of him. Fallen into the wrong hands because she did not know his love nor trust him. If she had come to irreparable harm because of his stupidity... The car had come to a soft landing within the Dome of Heritage. Lucy, Jimmy, and Kal-El met him at the hatch, a look of concern painted clearly on their faces. Ethan surprised himself by being able to lift Kali without the slightest effort. They gathered around her in the medical room. It did not take too long to heal her visible wounds using the advanced technology available to them. What did bother them though was that Kali did not stir even once during the process. ALthough Alura and Zor-El assured them that she was mereky sleeping, they could not help but worry. \"You need to go help Kara instead of pacing all over the place.\" Kal-El advised. \"I can't leave her.\" Ethan responded. \"Sure you can. She is at her safest here.\" \"But I have no idea what to do. How to help Kara. I am not a superhero.\" Kal-El could not help but smile inwardly as he listened to Ethan. There was no reason for his uncertainty, but he was not in a position to point that out. All he could do was help him come into his own in a world that he was never a part of before. \"A superhero is not just about having powers Ethan. Anybody can be a hero provided that his heart is in the right place. You have always been right there fighting the good fight alongside Kara and I. You have helped good triumph over evil with every chance that you got. Not because Kara made you do it, but because you have always had a good heart. You are a superhero Ethan. You do not need the perks that extraordinary abilities presents to prove that.\" Kal-El coaxed him into remembering all the battles the House of El had fought since Kara had come to earth. At the end of each lengthy battle, Ethan always stood proudly beside his wife while celebrating the triumph of good over evil. Now Ethan was equipped to help Kara. To fight alongside her as somewhat of an equal. His daughter lay silently on the bed, the reason why he hould and must find it within him to fight the good fight. What kind of human role model would he be to her if he did not do his part to help his own race? Midvale needed him as a savior just as much as they needed Supergirl. \"Let me gas up the car.\" he declared as he walked purpoefully towards the take off area. \"Don't be silly Ethan. Do you really think I would let you use a supercar that needed gasoline? The exhaust fumes from a similar natural power from Krypton helped to destroy my planet. Your car runs on something else. I fixed it to run on both solar and lunar power already.\" Kal-El explained. \"Excellent!\" Ethan headed for the launch pad with a new energy in his steps. **** \"Lucila, do not force me to kill you as well!\" Bianca sent a warning blast of lighting towards Selena's daughter which she evaded with a hand shield spell. \"We don't have to kill these people Bianca! They are not the ones who killed my mother! The only person we should concentrate on is Supergirl!\" \"These people dared to defy your mother when she was in power! They deserve to die unless they submit to our leadership, which we know they will not!\" \"Bianca! I don't want to turn on you but I will if I have to!\" Lucila pleaded as she tried to bind the hands of Bianca to prevent her from casting any more destructive spells. \"Then you are against me! I have no use for traitors!\" with that declaration, Bianca waved her arms widely and called upon the powers of darkness to deal with Lucila. \"Powers of darkness take this woman from consciousness Render her in suspended sleep. So that I may continue and accomplish the task which has been laid out before me, the annihilation of Midvale, and the death of Supergirl.\" Lucila let out a wail of pain as a black spiral of wind engulfed her person. As the wind covered more of her body, she felt the life ebbing away from her until she could no longer keep her eyes open nor breath. However, she was not really asleep nor dead. She could hear everything going on around her. Her body floated into a perpendicular position as if she were lying flat on a bed. \"Listen as I kill the very people you should have helped me destroy. Their deaths shall cause your own slow death until I feel that you are ready for the final blow.\" Bianca laughed like a maniac. Kara saw everything that happened from not so far away. She had been bringing the last of the townsfolk to safety when her super hearing picked up Lucila's screams. Seeing everything unfold before her very eyes as she flew back towards them, she wondered what may have happened to make them turn on each other. She covered her mouth to muffle her own scream when she saw Lucila being eaten up by the vortex and then floating not far away from where Bianca still stood. Taking advantage of the further distractions that preoccupied her nemesis, Bianca made a bow and arrow materialize out of thin air. At the tip of the single arrow was a green, glowing stone -- the one thing that could finally put an end to Supergirl. \"Arrow of great flight, arrow of great might. Fly swift and sure, resting deeply where it is sure that the venom possessed shall take her life.\" She repeated the chant over and over as Kara flew nearer, finally releasing the arrow when she sensed that the arrow would not miss its target at the existing range. Kara tried to fly away and around the arrow when she realized what the attached projctile was. Yet she could not shake the arrow for some reason. It was almost like a heat seeking missile, flying swiftly towards its intended target. There was no way it was going to miss its her. By the grace of the Kryptonian gods, Ethan, riding the supercar came out of nowhere and struck the arrow down. The sheer thickness of the super car's body and frame was enough to protectively shield Kara from the effects of the Kryptonian rays that emerged from the explosion. \"Thank you honey.\" He heard Kara's thoughts in his mind. \"Is Kali alright?\" \"She's fine. Don't worry about her. Now, let's end this fight Kara. So we can go home.\" Kal-El had quickly taught him how to let Kara hear his thoughts while riding the car before he took off. In case he needed to communicate with her while she was outside of the car. An enraged Bianca was casting spell after spell towards the couple in the expectation that one of the spells would hit them and have the desired destructive effect on them. It was everything that Kara and Ethan could do to keep avoiding the spell strokes while trying to get nearer to their target. \"This is impossible!\" Kara cried out in frustration. From within the recesses of Ethan's mind, he heard Zaltar's voice, instructing him on what to do. \"Give her the Matterwand.\" the voice commanded. \"But I don't have it here.\" Ethan thought as he scanned around the car. \"Yes you do.\" Zaltar assured him. A low humming sound was emitted by one of the control panels in the car. Turning his attention to it, Ethan saw the Matterwand slowly materialize. Now, glowing in all its silvery glory before him, all he had to do was find a way to get it to Kara in order to give her a fighting chance. Then he remembered the crystals. \"Give me the power to fly.\" he commanded as he took the wand and opened the floor panel. After stepping out of the car, he felt himself floating in the air, he made a dash for Kara who was flying erratically as she evaded the spells. \"Kara!\" he held the wand out to her. She flew towards him. \"Zaltar said for you to use this.\" She glanced at the wand. Remembering back to the lessons she had with Zaltar on Argo City. She smiled as she took the wand from him. \"This will do the job.\" she gave him a quick kiss as she took off directly in the direction of Bianca now. **** Using the Matterwand as shield, she began to deflect the spells being cast. Sending the same spells back to Bianca who could not move fast enough to dodge the recasting. Each of the spells that backfired weakened her further and further until she reached the point where one final spell would spell her death. Kara knew that she could also easily use on of the spells Zaltar had taught her to go for the final kill and rid herself of the problem. But Kara was no killer. No, she would do the proper thing and bring Bianca to justice. For that was both the Kryptonian and Argonian way. She flew up to a severely weakened Bianca and floated before her. \"Why don't you end it Supergirl? I am ready to die.\" \"No Bianca. I do not kill anybody or anything for any reason. You of all people should know that. What happened to Selena, it could not be helped. She caused her own demise. But you, you can still change. Take this chance at a second life. Please.\" Supergirl explained as Bianca's knees folded so that she was sitting on the tracks already. Kara failed to see Bianca pull out the last remaining Kryptonite stone from within her long dress. Taking strength from an unseen source, she lunged upward at Supergirl, holding the stone to the center of her forehead. \"Die Supergirl!\" Ethan was at their side within seconds. Ripping Bianca away from his wife, she somersaulted and while holding the Matterwand, recited the chant that she never want to use. \"You must pay dearly for all the evil you have done in this world. For taking a life, you must pay with your own. For taking many lives, You shall die the same number of deaths. Until you can breath no more.\" Then she aimed the wand at Bianca who was being held up infront of her by Ethan. Ethan felt Bianca's body overcome with a severe heat from within her until flames rose from her mouth and smoke exited from her ears. In less than a minute, she had been reduced to smoldering ashes, flying harmless downwards toward the town. The battle was finally over.[Chapter 19] The Legacy Continues Kara and Ethan stood floating in mid-air as the smoke cleared between them. The weather was beginning to clear up and the flooding beneath them seemed to immediately subside. But the clouds remained dark above them. Ethan floated closer to his wife and held her close to him. \"It's okay honey. It's over.\" He stroked her hair and kissed her cheek to calm her down. Her body was visibly shaking and her grip on the Matterwand was loosening. He placed his hand on its exposed area and took it from her. Within minutes, the wand had de-materialized and returned to its hiding place between planes until it was needed again. She let out a low wail as the tears began to spill out of her eyes. \"Ethan, what have I done? How could I have used the death spell on her? A spell that on Argo City, we used only on those who tried to assassinate the Elders and Guardians? What has happened to me? I've become a killer...\" \"Hush... Stop it Kara. No. You haven't become a killer. You are still the same Kara who was sent to Earth to help protect it. You did what you had to do.\" \"But first I killed Selena... now Bianca....\" \"They left you with no choice. They tried to kill you. Bianca tried to kill our daughter! It was your mother's instinct that drove you to protect the family. I would have done the same thing to protect both of you.\" Ethan tried to explain to her as he guided her towards the Super car. Kara was obviously in no position to be flying and he felt his flying power starting to fade. Lucy and Jimmy stayed at the hospital with Lucila until she regained consciousness. \"Who are you?\" she asked weakly upon gazing her eyes upon the sleeping pair beside her. \"Lucila, you're awake.\" Lucy responded by pressing the nurse button as she cleared the sleep from her eyes. Jimmy continued to doze off on the seat next to her. \"Is that my name?\" \"Don't you remember who you are? You are professor Lucila Leighton. You teach Creative Writing classes at Midvale Community College.\" she tried to remind the woman. \"I don't remember anything....\" Lucila's voice had a tinge of panic in it. Lucy began nudging Jimmy to wake up as the nurse came into the room. \"Thanks for coming. We need the doctor. There seems to be a problem.\" Lucy explained. The nurse nodded and turned to fetch the doctor on duty. \"Jimmy wake up!\" Lucy finally punched him in the shoulder to wake him up. \"Youch!\" Jimmy yelped. \"What? A simple nudge would have been better Luce.\" \"Lucila's awake. She can't remember a thing.\" she brought him up to date while the patient stared blankly at them. \"Oh... That can't be good.\" Jimmy responded. \"You think?\" Lucy was being sarcastic. \"What the heck happened during that battle?\" \"Who really knows? Ethan and Linda won't tell us anything.\" They just stared on as the doctor came in and began to check on Lucila. Ethan would be picking them up soon to return to the island. Over the past few days, the island was starting to become their groups hang out as they all spent more and more time there than at the house in Midvale. The dome over Heritage Island opened up to allow Ethan's entry onto the premises. He had been flying in at the end of his work day in order to spend time with Kara and Kali who were staying on the island in order to allow Kali more freedom to discover her powers and learn about her Kryptonian and Argonian past from the crystals and simulations that the technology of the island provided. But there was something different about the island today. He sensed it the minute the car door opened. Kara was not around to greet him as she customarily did. Even Kali was not around to jump into his arms when he got out of the car. Strangely, he found that he was almost their equal when they were on the island. It was almost as if he were Kryptonian instead of human. He found himself capable of doing things that he could not do when he was back in Midvale. In fact, he too was being educated on the history of his wife and cousin in law's origins. He understood them better now and he loved his wife more than he ever thought it would be possible to love a life partner. The lights in the dome suddenly darkened and red and green lights filled the room. \"Ethan are you ready?\" Kal-El asked him. He came out of the shadows dressed in the traditional all silver suit that his father wore as the leader of the House of El. \"Ready for what Kal-El?\" \"She's got a case of Amnesia.\" the doctor explained to Jimmy and Lucy. \"I will need to run some tests in order to determine if this is a short or long term situation.\" \"But how could she have gotten Amnesia? She did not hit her head.\" Lucy wondered. \"Trauma to the brain isn't the only reason a person develops Amnesia.\" the doctor began to explain. \"A severe traumatic experience can also do it.\" Lucy and Jimmy looked at each other. Nodding at each other in silent agreement as they acknowledged the cause of the situation to one another. The battle. The door opened up to reveal Linda at the entrance. Kal-El had sent her back to Midvale to pick up their friends. Lois had already gone ahead to the island with Kal-El. \"Are you guys ready to go?\" She asked without realizing that Lucila was staring hard at her. \"Who is she?\" Lucila felt fear beginning to grip her. Linda looked wonderingly at her friends. \"She can't remember a thing.\" Lucy explained. \"Amnesia.\" she whispered. Linda nodded sadly as she walked over to the bed. \"Hi. Professor, do you remember who I am?\" she tried to jog the woman's memory. \"Should I?\" the woman wondered aloud. \"I am one of your students. I am Linda Logan.\" The mention of the name brought some snippets of memories of the battle to Lucila's memory. But she could not recall them as a reality. Rather, she thought of the images of Linda in the guise of Kara as a strange dream. \"I remember something... a dream.. you were dressed in blue and red. You were flying...\" \"You must have been dreaming.\" the doctor explained. \"Or been a witness to the latest battle that Supergirl saved the town from.\" \"Supergirl...\" Lucila wondered why the name sounded familiar to her. As their attention was mainly focused on Lucila, none of them noticed the thin black smoke that entered the room through the open room window and settled underneath the patient's bed. \"I'm sorry but you will all have to leave now.\" the doctor instructed as he pointed to the clock on the wall that signified the end of visiting hours. \"We will visit you again tomorrow.\" Linda assured Lucila as she squeezed her hand in a friendly gesture. Lucila had dozed off after the visitors had left. So she had no idea that the smoke underneath her bed had begun to leak out and begin to take a ghostly shape. A shape that would have been familiar to her if she had any memories at all. The figure floated towards her and nudged her awake. \"Hello Lucila.\" the other worldly voice of Bianca penetrated her consciousness. At that very moment, all the memories of Lucila came flooding back. But she was powerless to fight off the dark presence in the room. She opened her mouth to scream. An opportunity that Bianca took to take control of Lucila's body instead. Lucila writhed in pain as she tried to fight the being that insisted on taking over her body. \"No Bianca!\" she screamed as she lost the battle. Her own consciousness driven to a dark area of her mind as Bianca's self took full control of her body. \"Just as your mother was a weakling, so are you Lucila. Weaklings always lose.\" Bianca's voice came out of Lucila's mouth. \"This body is mine. The battle isn't over Supergirl.\" Ethan was now dressed in an updated version of the Guardian uniform that Zor-El wore during his lifetime. Pacing the floor, he was worried and excited at the same time about what was going on. Kal-El had told him that something big was going to happen that day and that the uniform was part of the event. Kal-El was holed up on the Hall of Knowledge for most of the day as he prepared for the forthcoming event. As the last remaining male Kryptonian, it was his duty to install Ethan into his rightful place within the House of El. \"Ethan, please go to the Hall of Knowledge. They are awaiting your arrival.\" his mother in law's voice instructed him. \"As you instruct.\" he replied in the manner that Kal-El had educated him in. The great giant doors of the hall opened upon sensing his presence. Marching into the hall, he saw Kara and Kali seated at the end of the walkway in what seemed to be some sort of thrones. They were both dressed in what he had come to learn were the outfits of the Queen and Princess of the House of El. Kal-El stood at the top of the step before them. Holding a crystal bejeweled sword before him. \"Ethan Logan. Step forth and kneel before the House of El\" Kal-El instructed when Ethan stopped walking as he was overtaken by the sheer beauty of the people before him. They looked like they were part of a painting instead of reality. Images of Kal-El and Kara's parents projected unto the sides of the platform. Jor-El, Zor-El, and Alura all stood proud and mighty as the newest son of the House of El came forth to accept his destiny. Lois, Lucy, and Jimmy lined the sides of the walk path. \"Ethan Logan, son of the planet Earth, husband to Kara of the House of El, and father to Karalinda, Princess of the House of El, do you accept the responsibility of becoming guardian to the secrets of the universe, Kryptonian power, and Argonian heritage that your wife and daughter were born into?\" Looking up from his bowed kneeling position, he looked upon his wife and child, both gazing upon him proudly. He smiled at them as he came to realize what was being asked of him. \"I do with all my heart pledge to be the Guardian of these universal and worldly secrets.\" he looked Kal-El straight in the eyes. \"Stand before me and hold out your hands.\" He was instructed. Raising the sword between them, Kal-El locked Ethan into his gaze. Seriousness evident in his voice and eyes. \"By accepting the Sword of El, you submit yourself to becoming a protector of all that is innocent and threatened. You swear to protect all beings and creatures who are too weak or unable to protect themselves. Do you understand what is being asked of you?\" \"I do.\" Ethan replied as he accepted the sword into his hands. Raising it and placing it diagonally on his left chest, he completed the vow. \"For this planet and its inhabitants need protection from the evils of the world and universe, I swear to aide the House of El in the constant and vigilant protection of the planet that we all call home to the best of my human and acquired extraordinary abilities.\" With that Kal-El stood aside to reveal an empty throne between Kara and Kali. \"Then come and take your rightful place in the House of El as the Prince Consort of Kara, Queen of the House of El.\" Lois, Lucy, and Jimmy could not help but clap and whistle at the end of the ceremony as the House of El stood before them, now complete and starting anew. One week later Moving boxes lined up outside the Logan home. There was a flurry of activity as Linda, Ethan, and Kali busily packed away their belongings. It was moving day for them. Ethan had just come into the garage with more sealed boxes while Kal-El tried to figure out the best way to fly out with the boxes. \"I'm flying off with these boxes. You can pack the rest into the car and Linda and Kali can fly with the rest.\" Kal-El explained as he strung boxes of various sizes atop each other. \"Okay. We will see you there.\" Ethan assured him. He waved off the super being laiden with about 40 boxes that no human would have been able to handle but Ethan knew was nothing to Kal-El. \"Honey, take a break?\" Linda had followed him with a glass of Lemonade. A welcome drink during that hot afternoon. He gulped it down in a few swallows. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" Linda's voice was uncertain as she watched him drink. He touched the cold glass to his forehead before answering. \"This is what will be best for our family Linda. We are not an ordinary family and never will be. I have accepted that now.\" he explained as he handed the glass back to her. \"But living on the island?\" \"Is what will help keep our family secure and intact. We will not be safe living in Midvale while Kali grows into her powers.\" he stated matter of factly. \"But you work here.\" \"And will continue to work here for as long as the Super car exists.\" He pulled her close and kissed her teasingly and lovingly at the same time. \"Don't worry.\" \"I'm ready mom, dad.\" Kali interrupted the tender moment between the couple by pulling on her mother's skirt. \"Yeah, right.\" Linda broke from the kiss first. \"Let's get into our flying clothes. She took Kali by the shoulders and turned her around heading back into the house. They were back in the blink of an eye. \"Ready guys?\" The roar of the Super car coming to life under Ethan's command greeted them upon their return. \"Yeah dad.\" Kali smiled at him, excited about where they were going. \"Then let's go.\" Ethan took off with his wife and child flying alongside the car. Their destination? Their new home on Heritage Island. With the House of El now fully reinstalled and the birth of the first in the next generation of El's, the legacy of the House of El and the protection of planet Earth was safely insured. The End A/N: I have a prequel to the Supergirl story planned. I am still working on the details but I hope to start work on it by June or July. It will be all about how Linda and Ethan have been meant for each other from the very start. Even before they even met. Stay tuned for more :-) ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER: Characters in this story remain the property of DC Comics, Inc.

Voices, laughter, music, and general good cheer could be heard in the distance. It was New Year's Eve and Nick Radford found himself in a position he never wanted to be in—alone. For someone who had grown up in this city until he was a teenager, Nick looked upon the place he once ached to return with different eyes. A knock at his door and his mother's voice interrupted his introspection. \"Nicky, honey, please come out. Talk to me,\" Linda Wallace pleaded with her son. Nick could barely recall a time in his life when his mother and father were together, much less happy. They had divorced by the time he was eight years old and he had been raised by his father, with occasional visits to his mother, ever since. The only time he recalled all three of them together with minimal fighting was when his mother had come to Middleton. Looking back, Nick now realised that his father must have made a great effort to ensure he had the opportunity to be with his mother. No wonder his dad had spent so much time next door, he thought with a smile, he was grateful that Cassie had entered their lives and made Sam happy. \"Nicky,\" his mother knocked again. He reluctantly opened the door, \"What?\" \"What has gotten into you?!\" she asked incredulously. \"You've always enjoyed my New Year's Eve parties, but now you are rude to my guests—my friends—, cause a scene and take off to your room without an explanation or apology! I thought your father would have taught you better manners.\" Nick shook his head. \"I'm sorry Mom, I can't stay here anymore. I'm packed. I'm going home.\" \"Home. To Middleton. To your father and his wife,\" she said, the jealousy evident on her face. \"Yes, home,\" he simply answered. Sliding past her as he headed towards the door, Linda's motherly instincts kicked in. \"But it's 10 at night and a nine hour drive to Middleton!\" \"I won't be able to sleep tonight and I need to get out of here.\" Nick could see the change in demeanour in his mother's eyes as they began to water. \"I'm sorry Mom,\" was all he could say as opened the door of the condo. \"But why? Why won't you explain this to me?\" \"You don't know? Your friend's didn't tell you what they said?!\" The look on her face had given them his answer. \"Ah, I see how it is.\" And, with that he left his mother behind, without saying another word. Grey House was buzzing with activity and looking as festive as ever for the upcoming New Year. Guests, townspeople, friends and family had gathered for the first New Year party Cassie—and Grey House—had ever hosted, and as with all her events it was going off without a hitch. With two hours left in the current year, Dr. Sam Radford returned downstairs after checking on their one year old twins, Alexander Samuel and Elizabeth Marie, in his wife's sitting-room. It was the only private, family area left in the B&B; after Cassie and Grace, much to his surprise, moved into his house after their marriage. He looked around hoping to spot his wife, but just as their eyes met his phone rang. Grace appeared next to her mother's side and asked her, \"Mom, has Sam heard from Nick?\" Cassie noted Grace's face was full of concern at the mention of her step-brother, \"I have a feeling we need to contact him.\" Returning her gaze to Sam she said, \"No, he hasn't heard from him, but I have a feeling you're right.\" Sam's caller ID had come up 'Linda' and, for him that was never good news. He answered the phone sounding as cheerful as possible despite his gritting teeth, \"Linda, how can I how help you? \"Sam,\" she said answered anxiety and worry in her voice. \"I'm sorry to interrupt your New Year activities, but I had to tell you…\" She paused for a moment and Sam could hear her take a deep breath. \"Nick has left New York. He said he wanted to go home, he had his bags packed, and walked out of the condo. I have tried to call him, but he is not answering his phone.\" As Linda shared the news, Sam's knees buckled and he stumbled to sit on the stairs. The next thing he knew Cassie and Grace, as if out of nowhere, were at his side. They watched as concern and worry took over Sam's face. \"What? Left?\" he asked, trying to grasp the news. \"Why? What happened? He loves spending New Year's with you in New York.\" \"I know and I don't know what happened,\" she explained. \"I was in the kitchen talking with the caterers—they had messed up royally on the hors d'oeurves…\" \"Linda…our son…\" Sam brought her back. \"Of course, yes. I was talking with them and all of the sudden I heard Nick's voice booming from the living room. He was cursing at my guests. I heard him mention you and Cassie in his loud rant as well. By the time I got out there to see what the matter was, he had already gone to his room. I don't know what's come over him, Sam.\" Cassie could tell by the lines forming on his forehead and look in his eyes that her husband was having trouble believing and processing the information he was receiving from his ex-wife. \"You're telling me Nick went on some kind of rant, was swearing loudly and mentioned me and Cassie? And, now he has left?!\" \"Yes,\" Linda replied simply and emphatically. \"OK, do you think he is headed back here?\" There was a pause before Linda answered. \"Yes, he said he was returning to Middleton.\" Sam had doubted most of Linda's version of events, up until now. Something in her voice told him this bit of information was the truth. \"Well, I am sorry he left,\" Sam consoled. \"I will have a talk with him and have him call you.\" \"Ok,\" she replied. \"Bye.\" With those final words, he hung up and put down his phone, immediately comforted by his wife and step-daughter. Nick sat at a red light in his father's Jeep trying to get a hold of his emotions. He phone had rung several times, but he didn't answer. His Mom. Later, Grace. They had both left messages; his mother still slightly pleading for him to return yet also scolding him for 'yelling' at her guests. His step-sister, on the other hand, was clearly worried about him: \"Are you alright? Nick, please call me. I have a feeling something's up.\" Ever since he had met Grace she always had her 'feelings' and usually they were, unbelievably, spot on like knowing he didn't want to go to Hong Kong or New York when his mother first came to Middleton, his backing out of London, knowing he was going to ask out Courtney and she was right again. No doubt he would soon be hearing from his Dad. Cars honked. The light had turned green while he was lost in thought. He shook his head. \"I have to get home,\" he said out loud to himself. He turned on the radio and a country tune belted out of the speakers; Nick made a face, changed the station and focused on the road ahead. Cassie knew Sam wasn't in the mood for celebration anymore. \"Why don't we go home,\" she suggested. \"George and Abigail handle Grey House, and Martha can preside over any other aspects that pop up.\" \"No, no,\" Sam insisted. \"You stay, but I will go home. This is the first New Year party at Grey House. The hostess should be here.\" Sam looked at her and she knew he would not give in. He wanted it his way; she would let him have it, for now, she decided. \"Ok, if that's what you want,\" she said, speaking to her daughter with just a look and letting her know she wasn't staying much longer. \"Why don't we all take Alex and Lizzie back to the house, so they can sleep in their own room\" Cassie began. \"And,\" Grace continued. \"I will stay with you, Sam, and wait for Nick to call.\" Sam nodded, agreeing with his Merriwick women's plan.[Chapter 2] Nick was on the freeway when cars began honking and making a racket; he wondered what had happened. He looked at the clock and it dawned on him—midnight and a new year. He had only been on the road two hours, but he decided he had better find a resting place and call his family to let them know he was alright. He was certain his mother had called his father by now. He pulled over to a 24-hour service station to find truckers and travellers resting along their journey, just like him. He turned on his phone, a picture of him and his family stared back at him. A recent Christmas photo: his Dad and Cassie holding the twins, Grace, Brandon, Tara, Lori, George, and even Abigail. Many of them weren't biologically related or even by the marriage, but they had accepted him and his Dad immediately as part of their extended family. It was a feeling he had never known, nor thought he would ever experience, but Middleton had changed all that; Cassie and Grace coming into their lives had changed all that. It had changed him and he was certain of it, now. He knew he would have to explain to his parents eventually, but at that moment he wanted to talk with his best friend and stepsister, Grace Russell. He hit her number on the phone and heard it ring on the other end. With 30 minutes left until the New Year, Cassie excused herself from the festivities and walked the short distance home. She walked into her warm house and was engulfed by the sound of her husband playing a soothing tune on his guitar and her daughter enjoying the moment. \"That was wonderful, as always,\" she said as she made her way to Sam giving him a kiss. \"I am so glad you decided to begin playing again.\" He smiled, \"Me too.\" \"Any word from Nick?\" she queried. \"No,\" Grace responded as Sam nodded his head in the negative. \"I was hoping we'd hear something by now,\" he said visibly concerned. She sat down next to Sam putting her arm around him, keeping him close. She was worried, and she knew whatever she felt was worse for her husband. A faint cry through the monitor reminded them that other members of the family also wanted attention. \"I'll look in on them,\" Grace smiled at her parents and went to Alex and Lizzie's room. \"Sam,\" Cassie reassured, \"Nick will be alright. He will make it home.\" The confidence and sureness in her voice made him feel better, yet his wife could still sense his tinge of worry. She hadn't seen him like this since he had lost a patient that first time since arriving in Middleton. Grace came into the living room with her sister, Elizabeth, in her arms. \"Mom, Sam, I tried but she doesn't seem to want to calm down. She's dry, I tried to feed her a bit, but she just won't settle.\" \"Aw,\" Cassie said taking her youngest daughter from her eldest. \"Sweetie, what's wrong?\" she whispered as the little girl calmed a little. Elizabeth saw her father and reached for him immediately; Cassie obliged her daughter's wish. Firmly settled in Sam's arms, the little girl finally calmed down her head relaxing on her father's shoulder, his arms wrapped around her little body. Cassie and Grace went to the kitchen to grab a bottle and looked at Sam holding his daughter as if she might slip away. \"Do you think she had a feeling, Mom?\" Grace asked. \"Yeah, maybe she did, honey. Maybe she did.\" Cassie smiled. She wasn't sure how much, if any, of the Merriwick gifts were passed to her son and/or daughter, but whatever it was that had brought Elizabeth to her father, it was just what he needed. Grace looked at her watch. \"Oh, wow,\" Grace exclaimed. \"It's almost midnight!\" The clock struck twelve. \"Happy New Year! Mom, Sam.\" Cassie and Sam kissed each other. \"Happy New Year.\" They said. Just then Grace's phone rang. They all looked down to see a picture and the ID 'Nick'. Sam nodded for her to answer. \"Nick, finally! Are you alright? Where are you?\" \"Hey, Sis. Happy New Year.\" Nick had begun calling her 'Sis' as a joke at first, but now she was beginning to think he actually liked it. And, that was fine with her because, in a way, she liked it too. \"Happy New Year Nick,\" she replied. \"And I'll ask again, where are you and are you alright?\" \"Yes, I'm fine,\" he answered. \"Our parents are right there, aren't they?\" \"Yes. So, you are ok?!\" \"Yes. You can tell them I'm alright.\" Grace mouthed that he was ok to her worried parents and gave them a thumbs up. \"Good. Where are you?\" she continued to question. \"Look why don't you put me on speaker phone as long as everyone's there,\" he relented. \"I don't think Dad will yell at me with you and Cassie in the room.\" Grace shook her head and chuckled, hitting speaker phone and setting the receiver on the coffee table.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: \"Nick?\" Sam asked. \"Dad, Cassie,\" came Nick's voice from the phone. Sam let go of the breadth he hadn't noticed he was holding. \"Nick it's good to hear your voice,\" Cassie began. \"We're worried about you.\" Her use of the present tense not going unnoticed by Sam. \"Nick, where are you? What happened?\" he continued. \"I'm on my way home and I really don't want to go over this on the phone though I am sure Mom called you.\" \"She did and I want to hear your side,\" Sam replied. Nick was grateful that his Dad didn't make any snap judgements. \"Ok Dad.\" \"Uh, Nick,\" Cassie interjected. \"Wouldn't you want to stop at a hotel and continue the journey tomorrow morning?\" Sam perked up. \"Yeah Nick. Cassie is right. You shouldn't be driving at night.\" \"Dad, Cassie, I appreciate the suggestion, but I am pumped up on coffee now and really just need to be home.\" Sam, Cassie and Grace all looked at each other. His last statement hadn't been lost on them. \"OK,\" Sam said reluctantly. \"But give us a call when you're an hour outside of town, got it?\" \"Yes, and drive safely,\" Cassie added. \"Ok guys, I will. I promise,\" Nick replied. With that Grace picked up her phone again and placed it on private mode. Sam and Cassie went to put a sleeping Lizzie back to bed. \"Ok, Nick. It's just me. What happened?\" Nick chose his words carefully. \"Let's just say I've seen my mother in a new light and understand why my Dad always becomes 'Mr. Gritty-teeth' when she's around.\" Grace couldn't help but crack a smile at Nick's description of his dad, but she knew that whatever he had learned had fundamentally changed his feelings towards his mother. \"Ok, well I'd better let you get back on the road. Be safe Nick.\" \"Thanks, sis. See you soon\" And, with that, the line went blank. Cassie came back out just as her daughter had finished her conversation. \"Sam went to get ready for bed. He's drained, emotionally and physically. But, Lizzie and Alex are good; sleeping peas in their pods.\" Grace smiled, but her Mom read more on her face. \"What?\" \"Mom, there's more to this story.\" \"I know. Things have changed. Nick's not a boy anymore, but when he's with his mother that changes.\" Grace nodded, \"Nick the adult, the one we know, is not necessarily the one his mom knows.\" \"There we go. You're on the right track,\" Cassie said. Grace was understanding. She'd be there to help her step-brother. This time she wouldn't mess it up. With her new found sense of confidence, her mother kissed her goodnight. Cassie Nightingale entered her bedroom to find her husband in bed behind the latest copy of The Lancet . \"Happy New Year, handsome,\" she said. The journal lowered to reveal a face that was tired, but at ease. \"I can't sleep,\" he said. \"I don't think I will until he's safe at home.\" \"Of course,\" she said slipping into her side of the bed, snuggling up close and kissing him softly. \"Then why don't we stay up together.\" That first night of the new year Cassie and Sam stayed up together talking, taking care of their kids, and simply being with each other. Nick continued his way on the quiet interstate, a million thoughts going through his mind. He thought back to the first time he took this road, with his father, what seemed like an eternity ago. On that trip, he was angry: at his dad for leaving without warning, at Noah for leaving him behind at the beach house, and at his mother—suddenly, it like a ton of bricks it hit him and he pulled over to the side of the road. He was angry at his mother for letting him go. He knew Geoffrey hadn't lied that night when, having had a bit too much to drink, he blurted out to Nick that his mother took a job in London rather than stay to work out custody all those years ago. It was his mother who had lied; his father had never 'stole' him from her as she had claimed. His father, he thought, had not been truthful either when he said that they had come to the conclusion together. His mother never fought for him, he realised. Tears began to well up in his eyes. He couldn't stop it. He didn't stop it and the tears fell. Like her parents, Grace hadn't been able to sleep. She was worried about her stepbrother; she was impatient to talk with him again, but figured another phone call would only irritate him. Instead, she got up to make tea and met her mom in the kitchen, who had had the same the idea. \"Can't sleep either,\" she said getting another cup for her eldest. \"No, I can't help thinking about Nick,\" Grace said taking the cup and pouring the hot water into the Brahmi tea leaves. \"I can't shake the feeling that he's hurt.\" Her mother looked concerned. \"Not physically, Mom. We both know there is more than one way to get hurt.\" She knew Grace had a connection with her siblings and Nick was no exception. \"You are a good sister to Nick. You always have been.\" Grace smiled, \"Thanks Mom. He's always been there for me too, even though he won't admit it.\" And with that she kissed her mother and went back to bed. \"This I know,\" Cassie said smiling and returned to her husband. The sun and the Radford twins had been up for a couple of hours when Nick pulled into the familiar street and finally into the driveway. The basketball hoop that he had spent uncounted hours in front of in high school looked as alone as he felt, but he was happy to be back in Middleton. He walked into the quiet house, and looked around. He had never noticed the slight changes that Cassie made upon moving in: the red decorated mugs and baby bottles drying on the dish rack, the painting of Grey House and the family done by the painter that had stayed at the B&B;, teas and spices scattered about the kitchen for Cassie's delicious culinary crafts, and family photos: his Dad and Cassie's wedding, himself with Grace and the twins, holidays with just the four, then six of them, and all the family. This house had certainly become a home. Knowing his dad, he guessed his parents hadn't slept much that night either and he went to the fridge to grab some juice. Turning around, there stood Grace with their little brother in her arms. He shook he head, \"I still don't know how you do that, but I gotta say always cool.\" She smiled while Alexander reached for his brother. \"You want your big brother now,\" Nick added. \"He's glad he's home,\" Grace finally spoke up. \"I'm glad he's home too,\" said Nick taking the boy into his arms and giving him a hug. \"Hey, little bro, I missed you.\" He headed toward the couch with his one-year old brother firmly in his arms. Grace followed with a bowl of plain Cheerios for all of them. Nick sat, obviously exhausted, but he played with Alex while munching. \"So, ready to talk,\" Grace queried. Nick took a breath, \"Yeah, I finally think I am.\"[Chapter 4] Nick placed Alex in the play area next to the couch and made sure he was occupied before turning his attention to an eager and patiently waiting Grace. \"Well, you know\" he began. \"Since my mom came to Middleton that one time I've spent the last part of winter holidays with her in New York.\" Grace nodded in understanding. \"This year was going as good as normal,\" he continued \"until the party last night.\" Approximately 12 hours earlier in a stylish New York City condo: Linda Wallace was frantic; her caterers had completely messed up. \" Relax, Mom,\" Nick said trying to calm the oncoming storm he knew the catering company was going to experience. \"Why don't I run to the shop down the street? Maybe they have some frozen appetizers or…\" Linda stopped her son. \"Nicky, don't finish that sentence. What has your father and step-mother been teaching you about hosting?!\" She asked rhetorically. \" Actually,\" Nick answered honestly. \"Stephanie always caters Cassie and…\" Nick saw his mother's glare and decided it was best not to continue. \"Never mind. How can I help?\" \" Nick, I'm sorry. I just need some space to get this fixed.\" \" Right. Ok.\" Not quite noticing the slight disappointment in her son's response, she continued, \"Go ahead and mingle. Chat. I am sure someone would be interested your history stuff you're studying at university.\" \" It's my ancient civilisations course, Mom.\" \" Right, yes. That!\" \" Ok.\" He shook his head. \"I'll be in the main room, if you want me.\" But Linda had already moved on to another catering catastrophe. Nick rolled his eyes and went to join the rest of the guests. Some were friends of his mother from when she was married to Sam, but many were business acquaintances, new and old. But, there was one face he certainly recognised, Geoffrey. He had heard they had gotten back together not long after Linda's return from Middleton, but he had not seen him since before leaving New York. Geoffrey's big smile gleamed at Nick from across the room. \"Hey, Nick,\" he called out from across the room, waving him over. Reluctantly, Nick made his way to his mother's on-again-off-again boyfriend. \"Hey, Geoffrey, how are you?\" \" Better now that your mom's back,\" he said, clearly a bit tipsy from his consumption of alcohol. \"Everyone, this is little Nicky Radford. Linda's son.\" Nick didn't appreciate Geoffrey's introduction, but smiled nonetheless. \"Oh, I didn't Linda had a son,\" said a voice. \"Yep, he lives in Smallville, USA now with his dad and evil stepmother, well according to Linda,\" they laughed. Nick frowned. \"It's Middleton and Cassie is a great stepmother,\" he said trying to hold off his growing annoyance and anger. \"Oh, sorry. Nicky does wuv his step mommy,\" Geoffrey taunted drunk. They laughed louder this time. Anger was beginning to bubble over within Nick, and the adolescent games continued. \"What kid would defend a stepmother over his own mother,\" Geoffrey challenged. \"Good thing she didn't waste time over a custody battle all those years ago when she has such an unappreciative son.\" \" What's that supposed to mean?\" Nick bit back. \" Oh, you don't know.\" Geoffrey smugly replied. Nick got impatient. \"If you have something to say, go ahead, say it,\" he challenged loudly. \" Well little Nicky, when your mom and dad divorced all those years ago, your mom decided to take a job in London rather than stick around battling it out with your old man over who got custody,\" he said smugly. \" You take that back!\" Nick said loudly as he launched himself forward to come face to face with Geoffrey. Nearby guests had already stopped their conversations and were focusing on the brewing argument, but the stares intensified. \" Why? Your mom told me herself when we first starting dating.\" \" You're a liar!\" Nick yelled. This time the room stopped, the attention on him and his mother's boyfriend. Geoffrey saw his opportunity to end the conversation. \"You didn't know, did you? Well…\" \" You are a f—king liar,\" Nick said sternly. However, by this time his mother had also noticed the confrontation happening between her son and Geoffrey and was right there to hear his final word. \"Nicholas!\" She cried, stunned. \"What are you doing?!\" Nick had not noticed his mother enter the room and was speechless for a moment. \"Mom? I…He…\" he finally stumbled. \" How dare you speak to Geoffrey like that,\" Linda admonished. \" But, Mom he…\" \" I don't want to hear it, Nicky. You apologise, please, right now!\" \" Me? Apologise? Don't you even want to know what happened? What he said?\" He pleaded. \" I don't care what he said,\" she scolded. \"I only heard what you said and that was enough.\" Nick glared at his adversary and then at his mother. \"No. I won't,\" he said and took off towards his room. Nick fell silent after his story. Grace waited, taking it all in. \"She lied,\" he finally said, breaking the silence. \"I believe him. She lied.\" \"Your mom?\" Grace queried. \"Yeah, she told me my dad 'stole' me from her. My dad said they came to the decision together. They both lied, I guess, though my mom's was more severe,\" he confessed. \"So, you believe Geoffrey told the truth?\" \"Yeah. She essentially gave me to my Dad after the divorce. She took a job in London rather than wanting to take care of her son,\" he said looking dejected and bent down to pick up his brother. \"You, little bro, are lucky that your mom loves you so much. Don't take that for granted.\" Alexander smiled, reaching out to touch his brother's face, giving him a burble for an answer. Nick pulled him to his chest, hugging him. Grace could see the pain in his eyes, though he didn't say anything. \"Nick, I am sure that was difficult to hear, but…\" \"Grace,\" Nick interrupted. \"Don't. Your Dad loved you, heck, my Dad loves you. You don't understand. No one would.\" With that, Nick seemed to shut down. He took Alex, a few toys, and headed toward his room. \"Thanks for listening, but I think I want to be alone now.\" Grace opened her mouth to object, but Nick stopped her. \"Ok, not alone. Alex is coming with me,\" Nick retorted grabbing the boy's play crib. Grace pondered the story and situation. The revelation had clearly hit Nick hard and she knew she couldn't help him—not on her own anyway. She was lost in thought when Sam and Cassie came into the room, Elizabeth in her father's arms. \"Grace, I thought you had Alex?\" Cassie asked her eldest. \"Uh, yeah. Nick is taking care of him,\" she said still lost in thought. \"Nick's here?\" Sam spoke up. \"Yeah, he's been back for a bit.\" \"How is he?\" \"Where is he?\" He said looking around the room. \"In his room with Alex.\" \"Grace, why didn't you let us know?\" Sam asked. \"Well, I just felt he wanted to talk to me first,\" she explained simply. Sam had learned to trust Grace's 'feelings' as much as her mother's. \"Ok,\" he said nodding with understanding. \"Did he tell you anything?\" Cassie asked. \"Oh yeah. He told me everything.\" \"And?\" Sam queried. \"Long story, short.\" Her parents nodded. \"He said his mother took a job in London rather than work out custody all those years ago, Sam.\" \"Oh dear,\" Cassie said.[Chapter 5] Sam stood, stunned. Anger, pain, concern seemed to cross his face in an instant. He sat next to Grace and she took her sister from his arms. He put his hands in face and started shaking it back and forth. \"No, no, no,\" he repeated like a mantra. Cassie sat on the other side of her husband and pulled him to her side, her arm wrapped around his. \"I remember when you said you never told him because you said it would be hard on him, but his is an adult. He will work through it, Sam.\" Sam looked at Cassie and managed to crack a smile. \"I believe I said it would kill him to find out.\" \"That you did. Though, even back then, I thought you were exaggerating just a bit,\" she teased by making a small gesture with her thumb and fore-finger. Sam gave her the look she knew so well, showing her he knew she teased him. \"Maybe a bit,\" he admitted. \"Grace, how did he seem?\" \"Upset.\" Grace said getting that look in her eyes. \"Grace?\" Her mother asked. \"Don't worry, Mom. This is big, but I'm wondering…\" Grace got up giving her sister back to Sam and kissed her mom on the cheek. Cassie and Sam smiled at each other. \"Well, she is her mother's daughter so I trust her instincts, but I still want to see if Nick will tell me the long story,\" he said getting off the couch. \"You take Lizzie?\" \"Of course,\" she said taking her youngest daughter from Sam. \"Hello, my sweet girl.\" Elizabeth squealed happily as Sam handed her to Cassie and went towards Nick's room. \"Your older brother is having a hard day. Maybe you can cheer him up later, eh girlie?\" Knowing she couldn't do anything else at the moment, Cassie left a note for her family that she and Lizzie had gone to Grey House to check on guests, and perhaps visit with Grandpa George and Abigail. Sam stopped at Nick's door before knocking, wondering if he could really help his son. He knocked, deciding his son needed to hear the story: the truth. \"Nick, can I come in?\" Nick answered, shushing his Dad, pointing his sleeping brother. \"Hey Dad,\" he said quietly. \"Hey,\" Sam replied walking into the room glancing at his other son, sleeping soundly. \"Grace told us what happened, well a short version. You wanna talk?\" Nick stayed silent. \"Ok, you want to get mad at me? Yell?\" \"No,\" he smiled. \"I did that to Geoffrey and Mom. Besides Alex is asleep.\" \"Ah, Geoffrey,\" Sam answered with a knowing look. \"Yep. He let a skeleton out of the closet.\" \"Right. Anything I can tell you?\" \"The truth. Did Mom really give me up, let you have me, not even try for custody?\" Sam's heart broke. His son asked him the question he had always dreaded answering. Even though Nick was in university, for Sam, he could have been 10. \"I'm sorry son. The truth is she didn't counter me on custody. I wanted you full time and would have gone to the mat for you, but she decided to take the job in London in the end. No custody issues.\" \"So she did lie. You did too, kind of,\" Nick stated plainly. \"You didn't come to the agreement together, and you certainly didn't steal me from her, like she said\" \"Well, no I guess it really wasn't decided on together; it just was. And I certainly didn't steal you, like she claimed. I am glad, at least, you know that. I'm sorry, I just wanted to protect you from…feeling like this.\" Sam said, hand on Nick's shoulder. \"What else can I do? How can I help you through this?\" \"There's nothing else to say or do, Dad. I want nothing to do with her.\" \"Now Nick,\" Sam countered. \"You don't mean that. She's your Mom. Your family.\" Nick looked at his sleeping brother and motioned for them both to leave the room, shutting the door. \"Yes I do Dad,\" he said, gradually getting angrier. \"My family is here. In Middleton. I don't want to see her anymore. She didn't want me then, I don't need her now!\" With those final words, he grabbed the basketball and headed to the familiar basketball hoop, now situated outside Grey House. Grace walked into the Bistro looking for a familiar face, but not finding it she took a seat at the counter as Stephanie walked up to greet her. \"Hey there college gal,\" Stephanie said cheerfully. \"How's the future Dr. Russell?\" Grace smiled. She had recently declared her pre-medicine major at the university, but was keeping her future ambitions quiet for the moment. She was sure, however, both her mother and stepfather would approve. \"Pretty good.\" \"Well then, what can I get ya?\" \"Er,\" she glanced about again, \"how about tea and pie.\" \"Looking for someone?\" Stephanie asked handing her the pie and a cup of tea. \"Yeah, my old friend from high school. You remember Anthony?\" Stephanie nodded as Grace continued. \"We lost touch after his parents divorced. I've always regretted it and I hope this is an opportunity to fix it a bit.\" \"Well, your chance just arrived,\" she responded, gesturing towards Anthony who had just walked in and was heading to sit down in the plush leather couches of the Bistro. Anthony was surprised to receive Grace's email. They had not spoken since their freshman year in high school when Nick Radford had moved in next door and, for Anthony that was the moment he had lost his friend. He was curious as to why she had contacted him particularly since he had learned through the Middleton grapevine of Sam and Cassie's marriage. The person he considered a cretin was now a permanent fixture in Grace's life. To say that he was jealous would have been an understatement, so he avoided the Bistro when he and Grace lost touch. Now he found it to be so different that he almost didn't recognise it! Grace let him settle and ordered another slice of pie and coffee, then sliding of the stool, moved to join her childhood friend. \"Hey,\" she said nervously. \"Hey,\" Anthony answered non-committedly, barely looking up from his textbook. She sat across her old friend, unsure how to begin. They both sat in an uncomfortably thick silence until Stephanie brought over the pie and coffee that Grace had ordered for him. \"Tea, coffee and two desserts,\" Stephanie announced. \"Good to see you again, Anthony. It's been a while.\" \"Thanks Stephanie. The Bistro looks…nice.\" \"Well, thank you.\" And, looking at Grace as if to wish her good luck, she left the two of them alone. Grace took her chance to jump right in. \"Anthony, thanks for agreeing to meet me. I know it's been a long time and that we haven't really spoken much since high school,\" she explained, as if needing to justify their meeting. \"And, well, I am sorry that we drifted apart.\" Silence lingered between them again, but this time it was a little lighter. Anthony sighed, \"Apology accepted.\" Grace smiled back. \"Thank you.\" \"I forgave you a long time ago. I know things changed, for both of us, friends drift apart,\" Anthony admitted. \"They do, but they shouldn't.\" \"Well, life happens.\" \"That it does,\" Grace thought about the past few years since Anthony had left her life. Brandon and Lori continuing to live their lives as adults (most of the time without her), her tumultuous friendship with Nick and then becoming the closest of step siblings, her Mom and Sam dating followed by their marriage and the birth of her newest little brother and sister. Her mother had often told her fate and the universe played a lot with what could happen in a person's life and Grace could certainly believe it. \"Life sure changed for you,\" Anthony continued, pulling her out of her reverie. \"Your Mom and Nick's Dad getting married. That must have been…interesting.\" \"It was actually wonderful,\" she smiled, \"Mom and Sam are amazing together. Sam is a great stepfather, I have a stepbrother and another brother and sister, only we share our mother rather than our father. And, I am the older sister this time.\" The pride and love for her family written all over her face as she talked about them. \"Well, then you got lucky,\" said Anthony less jovially. \"I got to go through a rough, lengthy and sometimes mean custody battle. It was finally decided on joint custody, but the majority of time was spent with my dad. My mom got remarried, but my stepdad, well he's not like yours.\" Grace listened to her old friend; sad for him and what he went through without their friendship. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Yeah. Thanks.\" \"That sounds like it was an awful time for you. I am sorry I wasn't there for you,\" she said sincerely. \"Look Grace what happened, happened. You shouldn't feel bad for not being there. Yes, it was an awful time, but I lived through it. Now I spend more time at school than either of my parents' place,\" he explained. Grace decided this was her moment. \"You know, that would sure help Nick to hear.\" Anthony scoffed. \"Yeah, sure. Just what I want to do. Tell my sob story to help my ol' buddy Nick. Come on, Grace.\" Grace sighed. \"Anthony…\" He stopped her immediately, shaking his head back and forth. \"Grace, when was your stepbrother ever civil, much less eager to talk to me,\" he argued. \"The one time I did try to connect with him, he blew me off!\" She knew he had a point. The winter storm and being stranded in the library with the both of them was something she would never forget. Anthony knew a Nick that was not the one she knew. \"You're right, but he's changed. Grown up,\" she tried to convince him. \"Just do me a small favour and try to talk to him. Tell him about your experience. It may help him see his situation…more clearly.\" Anthony laughed. \"Sorry, Grace. I…just can't.\" Grace closed her eyes in disappointment and he continued, \"Look, I appreciate your apology and I forgive you . I know he's your stepbrother now and you are trying to help him, but to me he will always be…a cretin.\" He smiled at the word they both agreed on as freshman, but he knew Grace didn't feel the same anymore. She clearly loved her brother. \"Right,\" she whispered before getting up. \"I get it, but if you could forgive me for letting our friendship go, maybe you might forgive him for not ever letting one start. Well, I do hope you don't stay away too long. Keep in touch, ok?\" \"Sure, Grace,\" he answered, and looked down at his books knowing how he had disappointed her. \"I'll let you get back to your…\" she paused. \"Studying,\" he clarified. \"Studying,\" she said, waving goodbye. Once again, her attempt to help had been for naught. As Anthony watched her leave, he immediately began to regret how he treated her. Her final words hung in the air, and in the back of his mind.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Nick crossed the driveway over to Grey House; a short trip he had taken many times since he and his father moved to Middleton. His old basketball hoop had now found a new home in front of the Bed and Breakfast. He hadn't felt the need to pound the ball against the hoop, so he didn't care that it had relocated, but he needed it today. He was happy it was there and threw the first shot, just as his Dad had taught him. The ball swished through the net hitting the base and sprang into the side yard of Grey House. Chasing after the ball, Nick smiled when he saw his little sister toddling over to the ball that had lost its momentum upon hitting the grass. Elizabeth Radford had reached the rolling orange object and, finding it fascinating, began rolling it around and picking it up as if trying to dribble it already. Nick laughed at seeing the next Radford basketball star in the making and made his way over to her. He bent down to her level and said looking around, \"Hey my little Lizzie, where is mama, huh? I can't imagine she would have let you wander off like this?\" Seconds later, he heard Cassie's concerned call, \"Lizzie? Lizzie!\" she cried. \"Elizabeth?\" came George's call. \"She's here,\" Nick answered immediately, getting up so both adults could see him as his sister was still entranced by the round, orange orb before her. They were there in a matter of seconds, Cassie sweeping her youngest daughter up in her arms. \"Elizabeth Marie Radford,\" she said holding her tight. \"You had Grandpa George and I scared to death. No more running off, young lady.\" Cassie noted a small look of longing in Nick's face. As much as she loved and got along with Nick, she figured part of him would always have that sense of longing for a relationship with his mother that she had with her children. However, she wasn't Linda but, with the help of their family, she would work to make sure he had the best possible one with his mother. \"Thank you for finding her, Nick\", George said. \"Cassie and I were discussing Grey House business, we put her down and the next minute we look she's gone off somewhere.\" Looking to Cassie he continued, \"You and Sam are going to have to keep an eye on this one, I think.\" Cassie smiled and nodded, \"It looks like we might.\" George excused himself, Cassie promising they would continue their business at a later time. Nick picked up the ball and was about to return to the hoop when Cassie stopped him. \"Nick, you haven't needed to shoot the basketball in a while,\" she said gesturing to the ball. \"Shall we take a walk?\" Nick nodded. Cassie's perspective on things usually made him see things differently. \"Sure,\" he agreed. They walked in complete, but comfortable, silence for a bit. Cassie carried on what she could of a conversation with her daughter and Nick admired his surroundings. The trees around Grey House were like none he had ever seen. They hung low and close to the ground, wrapping everyone who walked around them in their magic. They were actually a source of calm whenever he was stressed. \"Listen,\" she finally began. \"Grace told your Dad and me what you learned yesterday.\" \"Oh yeah, it was so fun to learn my Mom lied to me and was so selfish that she never even considered raising me,\" he said dripping with sarcasm. \"Well,\" she admitted. \"it actually wasn't such a surprise to me.\" Nick looked at her questioningly. \"Your Dad had told me the situation when your mom came to town that first time and wanted to take you to Hong Kong.\" \"Dad told you.\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"I can't say I'm surprised. He is lucky to have found you. We both are,\" he said truthfully. \"Aw, thank you Nick. I am quite lucky too,\" she smiled. \"You know, your Dad knew this would be a difficult thing for you to understand and process, he was trying to protect you.\" \"Yeah, I know. He said that. But, if he had told me I wouldn't have had to felt so blind-sided when Geoffrey blurted it out in a room full of people I barely know. My Mom wouldn't have had the option to save face with her friends; she would have had to face up to it!\" He said in frustration. \"Besides I've got Dad, you, Grace, Alex and Liz now. Even Brandon, Tara, Lori, George and Abigail. You are all my family. She lied, she couldn't admit to what she did and so…that's it.\" Placing her hand on his shoulder Cassie said, \"Now Nick. You don't mean that.\" Nick chuckled. \"You and Dad are rubbing off on each other. He said the same thing.\" \"Well, then maybe there is something to it.\" Cassie said, smiling at the thought of her and Sam giving the same advice to their kids. \"And, I can always tell when you two are thinking about each other,\" he added with his sideways grin, \"You both always get a huge smile on your face.\" They both laughed. A sparkle came to Cassie's eyes. \"You know, Nick, I ordered a cake from the Bistro for all of us as a dessert, and Stephanie texted earlier to say it would be ready this afternoon. Would you mind making a trip with Lizzie to pick it up?\" she asked. \"I've still got to finish speaking with George about Grey House matters and I know your Dad has hospital work to get done, so I will likely be the one to watch Alex so he won't have any interruptions.\" \"Uh, sure, no problem.\" A walk might do just as good as shooting hoops, he thought. \"Come on, little Lizzie,\" he said taking his little sister from her mother's arms and kissing her on the cheek. \"Let's take a walk and get some yummy cake for dessert, yeah?\" \"'Ummy!\" Elizabeth said excitedly clapping her hands. \"Well, I guess we'd better go then\" \"Thanks Nick,\" Cassie said unable to stop smiling at the sight of Nick with his little sister. \"No problem,\" he said waving good-bye with Elizabeth. Cassie waved back and laughed. There was no greater joy for Cassie than to see her family together. Sam, with Alexander happily settled on top of his shoulders, was making his way over to Grey House when he spotted Nick and Elizabeth. \"Hey, Dad,\" Nick said, while Elizabeth also got excited seeing her father and brother. \"Dadadada,\" she said. Sam kissed her cheek. \"So, where are you two headed?\" he asked his eldest son. \"Elizabeth and I are talking a walk into town to pick up tonight's dessert at the Bistro, right Lizzie?\" \"'Ummy!\" she responded. \"Yes, yummy,\" Nick and Sam both chuckled. \"Cassie asked me,\" he clarified. Sam grinned and nodded. \"Ok then. Sounds good.\" \"'Izzie?\" Alex questioned. \"Yes, there go your brother and sister. They will be back soon,\" Sam responded. \"Now, let's go see Mama, huh?\" To which Alex happily replied, \"Mamamama!\" Cassie had returned to the kitchen after her conversation with Nick and was prepping the small afternoon tea she offered to guests when she got that feeling that always brightened her day. \"Hello handsome husband and son,\" she said smiling to herself and turning to see Sam walking through the back door with Alex on his shoulders, both wearing the same grin. \"I will never get tired of you doing that,\" he said kissing her then carefully lifting Alex from his shoulders to a high chair that Cassie had prepared. \"Tea that tastes like coffee?\" she offered her husband with a glint in her eye. \"Of course,\" he replied gratefully taking the cup from his wife. \"I saw Nick with Elizabeth on the way over. He said he was going to the Bistro for cake?\" \"Yeah, I asked him,\" Cassie replied. \"I figured a trip to the Bistro might prove more fruitful than occupying the basketball hoop.\" Sam chuckled, \"Yeah, better to be out with his sister than getting angrier at his mother.\" \"Sam,\" Cassie began, taking his hands into hers. \"Nick knows you were trying to protect him by not telling him about his mother's custody decision, but he mentioned to me that he felt a bit blind-sided and felt that he would have been more prepared if you would have told him about it.\" She could sense Sam growing uneasy and uncertain at the direction of the conversation, but continued. \"He's angry at his mother, but perhaps if he had known the truth at an earlier point in time…\" Sam stepped back slightly and said, \"That this could have been avoided. Is that what you're saying?!\" \"That is not what I am saying Sam,\" Cassie countered seeing that her husband was beginning to get upset. \"You did what you thought was best. And, that is because you love Nick.\" \"Then what are you saying?\" he relented, his anger fading. \"Our past makes us who we are; it's part of who we become. You know as well as I do that he can't abandon his mother without harming his future,\" she said, prepping a bottle for Alex who had begun to get noisy. Sam nodded in understanding and agreement. \"So, we need to help him forgive his mother even if it means I take some responsibility for not telling him the truth.\" Cassie picked Alex out of the chair, walked past her husband and gently squeezed his arm before placing their son back in the play area. \"I think it would help.\" \"Duly noted.\" He turned to face her. \"You were thinking this when I told you everything the first time, weren't you?\" He saw Cassie's grin, yet she stayed silent. \"How come you didn't tell me then?\" Putting her arms around his neck and pulling him close she said, \"It wasn't my place. I was there to listen to my friend—and feed him—so that's what I did.\" Sam smiled and kissed her. \"Well, thank you for being there, then and now.\" \"And always,\" she finished. \"I love you,\" he said simply. \"Love you more,\" she responded sealing everything with a deep kiss. \"Doggie,\" Alex cried interrupting his mother and father's reverie and reaching for the stuffed dog that had fallen out of the play area. They both laughed as Sam bent down to retrieve the well-loved stuffed animal. \"Of course son, we can't have you missing your dog.\" As he handed the toy back to his one-year old son, his phone rang—a familiar name on the screen.[Chapter 7] It was a crisp, but sunny, winter day in Middleton. The kind where the sky reminded Nick of the bright, blue waters that surrounded the Maldives. That trip, he realised, was a big reason he was studying history and anthropology in university. He knew he needed to take advantage of the nice days, the snow would come soon enough. Nick pushed a stroller with his sister down Main Street toward the Bistro. Passing people said 'hello', stopped to admire Elizabeth, ask about his parents, or even ask about his own studies. This never happened, nor would it happen, in New York he thought to himself. Walking into the Bistro, he was immediately greeted by Stephanie's typically perky welcome. \"Hey there! It's two of my favourite Radfords! Hi Nick, Hello Elizabeth,\" she said tickling the girl and making her laugh. \"Hi Stephanie. Cassie mentioned you had a cake…\" Nick began. \"Oh, yes! But, it is at my catering shop,\" she said with a slight hint of regret. \"Stay here, have something to eat, and let me get it for you.\" \"Ok, sure thing,\" he replied grabbing a muffin from the counter. \"Lizzie and I will share this blueberry muffin.\" Grateful that they would wait, Stephanie handed Nick the muffin and darted out the door promising she'd be back in a jiffy. Nick shook his head and chuckled giving a piece of the muffin to his sister. \"You know Lizzie, you are quite lucky to be growing up in Middleton. I wish I did. I actually hated it here at first,\" he said handing her another piece. \"But, it has grown on me.\" Anthony had been at the Bistro since his conversation with Grace earlier that day and had witnessed Nick interact with his little sister. Maybe Grace was right, he thought, maybe the cretin had changed—grown up. \"'Ummy,\" Elizabeth said pointing over Nick's shoulder. \"Yes, Lizzie, Stephanie's getting our yummy dessert,\" he reminded his sister. She continued pointing past his shoulder insisting there was something 'yummy'. When Nick finally looked over to see the sweet that had caught her eye, he saw a face he hadn't seen in a long time. \"'Ummy,\" Elizabeth insisted, pointing to Anthony's piece of cake. \"Ok, Ok. I get it Miss Elizabeth. I can already see that you are lot like our sister,\" he smiled, getting up to make his way over to his old high school acquaintance. \"Nick,\" Anthony said. \"Anthony,\" he responded. \"Sorry about my sister. She has quite the sweet tooth even if she doesn't have that many teeth.\" Anthony chuckled and smiled slightly. \"No problem,\" he replied. \"Sit down, if you want, I don't have the plague or anything.\" Nick sat down and took Elizabeth out of the stroller placing her on his lap with a bottle. \"She can have a bit my cake,\" Anthony offered. \"Thanks. Maybe later. Cassie doesn't like to give her too many sweets.\" Nick turned his attention to his sister once again, unsure of where to take the conversation with Anthony. He had recalled how he treated him in the past. \"You're really good with her,\" Anthony finally said. \"Oh, uh, thanks,\" he replied, surprised. \"I always wanted siblings, but never really thought it would happen after my dad and mom got divorced, but now I have three.\" \"Yeah, I heard about your Dad and Grace's Mom and the twins through the Middleton network,\" Anthony said. Nick laughed, \"Yeah, I guess there are no secrets in this town.\" \"Well, luckily there are still some,\" Anthony had said barely audible, but Nick did. \"Care to elaborate?\" Anthony quickly backtracked, shaking his head, \"oh, no you don't want to…\" Nick cut him off. \"Look, I was a jerk to you in high school. I was going through some things and I was just…stupid.\" \"Yeah, you were. That's big of you to admit,\" Anthony said somewhat shocked. \"Well, a lot has happened between then and now. I'm sorry,\" he finally said. Anthony studied him, looking for any hint of sarcasm or insincerity, but failing to find any answered, \"Thanks. I appreciate it.\" \"Well, I mean it. Really,\" Nick said honestly. \"Now, spill.\" Anthony laughed and nodded. \"Wow, if I didn't know better, I'd think that you and Grace were actual siblings. It's like a bit of 'Grace-ness' has rubbed off on you.\" Nick smiled and tickled his little sister, \"Yeah, well there's something about those Merriwicks.\" Sam gave Cassie the look that he had every time the subject of his ex-wife arose. Reluctantly, he answered his phone, \"Hello, Linda.\" \"Sam. Has Nick arrived back in Middleton?! He hasn't called me,\" she said in a slight panic. \"Yeah, he arrived early this morning.\" He took a deep breath. \"And, he told me what he learned last night.\" The other end of the line went silent. \"Linda?\" he enquired. \"Yes, I'm here,\" she answered. \"So, can you tell me just how Nick found out about the real outcome of our custody arrangement and reasons behind it?\" Linda could tell Sam's question was question was more rhetorical than actual, so she decided to be honest. \"Geoffrey¸\" she answered simply. \"Uh huh,\" he replied, happy that she had told the truth. \"Well, I can ask him to call you, but I won't make him. He's an adult. I let him make his own decisions.\" \"Sam,\" she persisted, \"You have to insist he call me. I've tried calling him, but he won't answer!\" \"Your relationship with Nick is up to you to maintain now,\" retorted Sam. \"He's hurt and a bit angry.\" \"Angry?\" \"Yes, Linda. Angry,\" Sam said, frustration visibly growing in his body language and tone. \"Do you happen to recall that you told him his father stole him from you and bullied you?\" Cassie rubbed his shoulders and he calmed slightly. \"Look, he's not happy with me either for not telling him the truth, but at least I didn't have it thrown in his face in front of strangers. That was Geoffrey, and you let him do that.\" \"That is why he won't return my calls,\" she finally said. \"Yep.\" \"Well, what should I do?\" Sam sighed heavily, \"I don't know, Linda. You need to figure this out on your own.\" \"Ok, well, thank you so much for your help,\" she said sarcastically. \"I've always thought it was important for Nick to have a relationship with you. You know that,\" Sam retorted. \"I thought it was pretty good…until now.\" \"It was,\" Linda admitted. \"Then find a way to get it back that way, and who knows, it might be even better now that this is out.\" \"Right. ok.\" she relented. \"Ok?\" he asked, wondering if she really meant what she said. \"You're going to do what you need to do and leave me out of it.\" \"Yes, Sam. I am a big girl,\" she smirked. \"Ok, I will tell him to call you, but whether he does is his choice.\" Sam warned. \"Understood,\" she replied. \"Bye, Sam.\" \"Goodbye Linda.\" Sam hung up his phone looking like a weight had just been lifted off his shoulders. \"I think she may finally be out of my life.\" \"Sam, she's Nick's mother. She will always be part of our lives in one way or another,\" Cassie said calmly. \"Perhaps,\" Sam said putting his arms around her. \"But you, Cassandra Nightingale, are my beautiful, kind and compassionate wife. The mother to our son and daughter, Alexander and Elizabeth Radford; and Grace Russell, my amazing step-daughter. And, a wonderful step-mother to Nick as well as Brandon and Lori. You are my life. Now and always.\" \"You, Samuel Radford, know exactly what to say to make my heart melt over and over again,\" Cassie smiled. \"I am so lucky to have found you. I love you.\" \"I love you too and I was just as lucky to find you,\" Sam answered, kissing her deeply.[Chapter 8] Anthony decided he would give civility, maybe even friendship, with Nick another try. \"So, you want me to elaborate on something not all of Middleton knows…\" Nick replied carefully, \"Only if you want to.\" \"Ok, then,\" Anthony said, moving forward and speaking in a hushed voice. \"Middleton may know that my parents divorced and my mom remarried.\" Nick nodded—even he had heard that. \"What is not known is how awful it was for the kid in the middle. I mean, I don't want or need a pity party or anything, but it was not a fun time.\" Nick was silent, somewhat stunned. He had not expected a confession like that. After what seemed like ages to both boys, Nick said, \"I'm sorry to hear that. Can I ask what happened?\" Anthony considered Grace's words and Nick's own recent actions and decided to give it a shot. Anthony recounted the tale of his parents' divorce and custody hearings that he had told Grace just hours before. Nick tried to imagine what it may have been like if his mother and father had actually gone through that process—he couldn't. \"Wow that must have sucked.\" \"It did,\" he continued, \"and in the end I ended up spending most of my time at my dad's. My mom remarried about a year later but, well it sounds like Grace probably got a better deal in the step-dad department.\" Nick smiled at the mention of his father and, looking to Elizabeth, said, \"Yeah, I guess we're pretty lucky to have our Dad, huh Lizzie?\" \"Dadada!\" she answered, seemingly in agreement. Both boys laughed, but Nick got serious again. \"I am sorry you had to go through that. I can't even imagine what it must have been like.\" \"Well, consider yourself lucky that you didn't then,\" Anthony said. Nick simply nodded. Just then Stephanie came in, \"Ok, sorry to keep you waiting. Here's the cake. Cassie already paid, so you're go to go!\" Nick placed Elizabeth back in the stroller and the cake safely down in the basket below. \"I hope you enjoy it,\" she smiled. \"'Ummy!\" Elizabeth said. Nick gave his sideways grin and said, \"I think we will. Thanks.\" Stephanie waved at them both and went back behind the counter. \"Bye Anthony. I'm…I'm glad we talked. Don't be a stranger.\" Grace was right, Anthony concluded, Middleton had changed Nick, he had grown up. \"Bye Nick. Yeah, I'll see you around.\" He looked at Elizabeth and gave her a little wave, \"Bye, bye Elizabeth.\" Bye, bye, bye,\" she repeated, waving her hand all about. Grace, upon leaving the Bistro, had gone to meet Courtney and catch up with her for a spell before heading back home. She soon felt another presence coming up behind her and she stopped, turning to see her step brother and little sister. \"Nick,\" she called out. \"Hey Grace!\" he answered pushing the stroller faster, much to the delight of his smiling sister. \"What are you two up to?\" she asked, with a smile and kiss for the smaller Radford. \"'Gace,\" Elizabeth smiled and clapped her hands. Nick explained. \"Cassie asked me to take Lizzie into town to pick up this dessert from the Bistro.\" \"Oh, really,\" Grace responded slyly. \"And, you'll never guess who we ran into…\" \"Well, if I'll never guess you'd better tell me.\" \"Your old friend Anthony.\" \"Anthony? Really?\" \"Grace,\" Nick smiled. \"Thank you. It was really good to talk to him and…apologize.\" \"And you're thanking me now?\" she questioned. She hadn't expected Nick to apologise to Anthony, but she was glad it had happened. Nick had changed and she loved the brother he had become. \"Well, that was really good of you. Really good.\" \"Yeah, well I was a jerk to him. He didn't deserve it.\" The step-siblings and best friends looked at each other, Nick gratefully believing his sister had pulled some of her 'magic', and Grace simply happy that she could finally help people dear to her, just like her mom. Arriving to their street, Elizabeth began to get excited and want out of her confines. \"Howse,\" she exclaimed pointing to Grey House. \"Howse!\" \"All right Miss Elizabeth,\" Grace said taking her out of the stroller. \"We are almost at Grey House.\" \"Tell our parents that I'm dropping the cake off at home. I'll see everyone at dinner.\" \"Ok, later.\" Grace answered. Nick headed off towards their house while Grace and Elizabeth made their way towards the Bed and Breakfast. \"Come on, Lizzie, let's go see Mama.\" \"Budder.\" she stated looking next door. \"Yes, you went on a walk with your big brother, and I have a feeling you may have pointed him in the right direction too,\" she smiled kissing her little sister on the cheek and walking through Grey House's front door. Nick walked into the house. All was quiet. His parents must have still been next door. He put the cake away and thought about his encounter with Anthony. Knowing his mother and father, he was certainly grateful there hadn't been any custody hearings. His phone rang and he saw 'Mom' appear on the caller ID. His mother had already called several times, so he decided he'd better answer. \"Hi Mom,\" he answered flatly. \"Nicky,\" she responded. \"Finally. Why haven't you answered my calls?! This is no way treat your mother. You—\" \"Mom, mom please,\" he cut in. \"What do you want?\" \"What? What do I want?!\" she answered in a shocked tone. \"I wanted to know what possessed you to act the way you did last night. Your father said you're angry…\" \"Yes Mom, I'm angry. Finding out from Geoffrey that you didn't even counter Dad on custody, yet telling me he stole me from you. Would you expect me not to be angry?!\" \"Nicky, I…\" she tried. \"No. I don't want to hear it, Mom. My life has changed. I have a family. A little brother and sister. A step-sister, who is also my best friend. And, I am surrounded by people who are actually interested in me and what I am studying at university. You don't even really know that and you're my mother,\" Nick argued. \"Nicky, I am sorry. It wasn't fair of Geoffrey to corner you like that. He had no right to say that.\" \"No, that was your job Mom and you didn't. If it was up to you, I would have probably never found out, right?\" \"Well, your father…\"she tried to counter. \"Don't bring Dad into this. This is something you did and you can't change it.\" \"Nick, come on,\" she said seriously. \"There has to be something I can do to show how sorry I am.\" \"Listen Mom, you don't need to worry about me anymore. You can continue with your career and your life. No need to concern yourself with me. I have a family who cares about me. Go to London, go to Hong Kong, or stay in New York, whatever. Your life is your life again, ok?\" \"My life is my life again?\" She repeated with a tinge of sadness. \"Yeah,\" he continued, tears unknowingly welling up in his eyes. \"Good-bye Mom.\" The line went blank on Linda's end. She slowly sat down, shocked and numbed by the conversation that had just transpired. Had she really just lost her son? Nick hung up on his mother. He couldn't believe he actually hung up on his mother. Wiping the tears that had gathered in his eyes, he took a deep breath. \"It's done.\" Later that evening, all of the family had returned to the house next door and the smell of dinner began to fill the Radford household. Grace and Nick were in their rooms preparing for the upcoming new semester. Alexander and Elizabeth played contently in front of the kitchen while their mother and father finished dinner preparations. \"Mmm, smells wonderful as usual, my love,\" Sam whispered in her ear, giving her a kiss on the neck. Cassie loved it when her husband was so attentive; he wasn't one for a lot of public displays of affection, but when they were alone, it was certainly a different story. \"Chili,\" she informed him. \"Care for a preview?\" He gratefully accepted a spoonful of her infamous chili and a big grin spread across his face. \"Excellent.\" Sam walked over to the twins and picked up Alex. Cassie followed just behind him taking Elizabeth into her arms and both parents sat down to enjoy a quiet moment with their children while the chili simmered to perfection. \"I haven't seen Nick since this afternoon,\" Sam mentioned as he lifted Alex up and down making him laugh. \"Did he stop by Grey House?\" \"No, Grace came by with Lizzie and said he had come home. He'll resurface for food. He always does.\" Cassie answered keeping a sharp eye on their Elizabeth wandering 'round and around the coffee table. Sam laughed, \"Yeah, I think he is quite grateful that you are the cook in this family. I think pasta and cereal for dinner was beginning to wear thin.\" \"I love that we cook together,\" she said getting up to intercept her youngest daughter from wandering too far from their sight, giving him a kiss on the cheek at the same time. \"And, that you do dishes.\" Sam smiled, getting up to set the table as Cassie prepped the chili for serving. Once dinner was ready, Nick and Grace emerged from their rooms. They each served themselves and sat down, discussing the day, while Sam and Cassie fed the twins in between their own bites. \"Nick\" Cassie enquired, \"Was Lizzie ok on your walk this afternoon?\" \"Oh, yeah, fine,\" he said, looking up from his food and speaking for the first time. \"She just likes to move around so much I was worried she might start fussing before you made it to the Bistro.\" Nick cracked a smile. \"We made it before that happened. And, I saw Grace's old friend, Anthony, there. We talked and I, erm, apologised,\" he admitted. \"I was a jerk to him in high school.\" Sam looked at his eldest son, impressed. \"I am proud of you Nick. That took a lot of maturity.\" Cassie smiled and added, \"Nick that was very good of you.\" Nick smiled, slightly embarrassed from his parents' praise, \"Thanks Dad, Cassie.\" Grace smiled and Cassie gave her a knowing look. Nick spent the rest of the meal in silence, his whole family aware of his demeanour. When the main meal was done being enjoyed, Sam and Cassie prepped the familiar, special dessert while Grace cleared the table and Nick watched over the twins. \"Something's still up with Nick,\" Sam informed his wife when they were out of earshot. Cassie nodded in agreement, \"I have a feeling the issue with his mother is far from resolved.\" Sam shook his head. \"I hate this,\" he said, cutting the dessert into pieces and bringing them to the table.[Chapter 9] Happy Good Witch Halloween Movie Day… Yellow cake with chocolate frosting. It was one of the few treats that Cassie knew would be a welcome delight for her husband as well as her two youngest children who had apparently inherited an affinity for it as well, they both ate their bits as enthusiastically as their father, and the other three members of the family watched the scene grinning amongst themselves. \"Uh, Dad\" Nick said after finishing his dessert. \"I know Mom still tends to contact you sometimes so I thought you, well everyone, should know that I won't be going back to see Mom at New Year's or any other time. She called and I told her how I felt, how…how I don't want to see her anymore.\" Sam was about to challenge his son, but Nick cut him off, \"You all know more or less why. Please don't try to change my mind. I know you all care, but this is my choice.\" He got up and cleared his plate. \"Nick,\" Sam attempted. \"Dad please,\" Nick pleaded. Cassie looked at her husband and he nodded in understanding, \"Ok.\" And, without another word, Nick went back to study. \"For now,\" Sam finished. The weather turned colder, the snow would soon fall. Days passed and things seemed to return to normal. Nick and Grace began their classes at the university again and, while it appeared as if he had gotten past the break with his mother, his family knew better. Grace felt her step-brother was only putting on a normal front, while Sam and Cassie stayed in a general state of concern. Finally, winter had arrived. Middleton was covered in snow. Sam and Cassie walked out of the Bistro, thankful for the date night and the offer from Nick and Grace to baby-sit their brother and sister. The underlying issue, however, continued to linger in the Radford household, Sam and Cassie both at somewhat of a loss of how to make it right again. Zipping his heavy coat and making sure his wife was equally warm, Sam said \"Well, Stephanie did it again. Another wonderful dinner and one we certainly needed.\" He grabbed Cassie's hand and held it tight. They began to walk along Main Street, just as they had since they had begun dating; a way to relax and stay connected. It was something they tried to do often, but admittedly got harder and harder. \"Any inspiration about our little problem,\" Sam asked hopefully. Cassie shook her head, \"Some things take a bit of time to work out, Sam. This will too…eventually.\" \"But in the meantime…\" said Sam tilting his head the way that Cassie loved. \"In the meantime, I hate seeing a member of our family so clearly troubled.\" Sam nodded in agreement. He had seen it too. No matter what Nick said aloud his decision had continued to weigh heavy on him. They walked together and the snow fell silently, Middleton quietly buzzing around them. They were pulled out of their thoughts by familiar voices. \"Sam, Cassie!\" Brandon and Tara called from behind them. They both turned around to find the young couple running to catch up to them. \"Brandon, Tara. How are you?\" Cassie asked. \"I know I see you at the shop, Tara, but we hardly ever see you together.\" \"Well, the same could be said about you and Sam,\" Brandon said. \"Yeah,\" Sam agreed. \"We need to do better about seeing everyone apart from birthdays and holidays.\" Cassie looked at Sam and nodded. \"Well, the past week or so have been a bit…worrisome for Sam and me.\" A look of worry and concern flashed across Brandon's face. \"Grace, Nick, the twins?! They're alright?\" \"Oh yeah, physically everyone's fine. It's just…\" Sam struggled at how much to say. \"Nick is having a bit of a hard time with his mother. That's all.\" \"Ah, sorry to hear that.\" \"Yeah, we're just trying to help as much as possible.\" \"Let us know if we can do anything,\" Tara said. \"Thank you, both,\" Sam said moving back and forth to keep warm. \"We'd all better move before we freeze.\" \"That's a good idea,\" Cassie agreed. The girls hugged and Sam patted Brandon on the shoulder, and all four continued their way home. The January snow continued to fall in Middleton and Cassie's afternoon tea was a popular offering with Grey House guests. In her kitchen, she happily talked with her youngest children while baking and boiling water for tea. It was one of those days where everything passed like a whirlwind. Departing guests were already missing their days in Middleton, newly arriving ones eager to see what awaited them and two one-year old twins causing mischief for their family. With Sam at the hospital and Nick and Grace still in class, Cassie was grateful the Tara had returned to working part-time at the shop as well as George's ever continual and steady help in running Grey House. Alexander and Elizabeth Radford, though they were fraternal twins, were still quite different. Physically they both had their father's sparkling blue eyes, which Cassie adored looking into every day, but otherwise there weren't two kids who were a near physical mix of both their mother and father. And, although their personalities were still forming, Cassie could tell she had two very different and unique children on her hands. Alexander could sit quietly with his stuffed dog and play with books, puzzles, or anything that consisted of concentration. Elizabeth was an explorer; like her mother and Aunt Joanne, she could not sit still and was constantly curious in discovering her new surroundings. Cassie knew early on that this particular Merriwick would be a mover. So, it didn't surprise her when she cried, \"Ma, out!\" \"Alright Lizzie, one moment,\" she said taking out the last of her baked goods from the oven and then picked up her daughter, who had been eagerly waiting with her arms up high. Putting her down for a moment to check on Alex, Elizabeth took the opportunity to dash towards the foyer of the B&B.; George came in at the instant and Cassie, just managing to see the little girl toddle away, said, \"Oh, George, there goes Lizzie again! Alex?\" George, understanding immediately, watched as she chased after her youngest daughter. She caught up with her just in time to see a silhouette at the door. Elizabeth noted it as well and stopped in her tracks, pointing to it. \"Howse?\" she said. Cassie was sure all the guests who were expected today had already checked in. \"Yes, it looks like we have an unexpected visitor to Grey House,\" she said, picking up her daughter. She opened the door, prepared with her greeting, \"Welcome to…\" The visitor turned around. \"Linda.\" \"Hello, Cassie.\" \"Welcome to Grey House,\" she finished, opening the door further to welcome her in. \"Thank you. I was hoping that you might have a room. I don't have a reservation,\" she asked a bit uneasily. \"Of course there's room. Do you know how long you plan on staying?\" she answered, going behind the desk to check her in. \"Until I fix things with my son?\" she said almost hesitantly. \"I think that can be arranged.\" \"I take it this is Nick's sister,\" remarked Linda, her weak attempt at small talk. Nick had told his parents about his telephone conversation with his mother, but Cassie still found Linda's behaviour slightly uncharacteristic from the woman she encountered when her husband first came to Middleton. \"Yes, this is Elizabeth.\" \"She has Sam's eyes,\" Linda remarked in awe. \"Yes, she does. Her brother, Alexander, does too.\" \"That's right! Nick told me his brother and sister are twins,\" Linda remarked as if it was some great revelation. \"Yes, just like Sam and Joanne are,\" Cassie replied calmly. \"Right,\" Linda replied with a touch of smugness in her voice. Cassie had never asked her sister-in-law what she thought of her brother's ex-wife, but she now considered that perhaps Joanne and Linda were not the closest of relations. \"I suppose Nick could have had a twin.\" Linda's eyes grew wide and Cassie could see that that would not have been a good scenario for her. \"Maybe he could have had,\" she said with a small grin, finishing up the check in and giving keys to Linda. \"Well, it's nice that your schedule is so flexible to work around two young children especially with Sam having such a workload between patients in Middleton and being Chief of Staff at Hillcrest.\" There was the Linda with whom Cassie was so familiar. \"Sam balances his family life and work schedule just fine,\" she said sternly and confidently. After giving her directions to her room and the welcome she would give any guest, Cassie added, \"You came just in time for tea. I will be here for a few more hours, if you need anything.\" \"Thank you,\" Linda said. Sensing she could not rattle Cassie, she took the keys and headed upstairs. \"That, my girl, is Nick's mommy. She makes Daddy a bit crazy and even gets on Mama's last nerve, but if I teach you anything, it will be kindness,\" she whispered to Elizabeth. \"Howse.\" Elizabeth repeated. \"Yes indeed, my darling, Grey House will be a very interesting place the next few days,\" she said, walking back to the kitchen. That afternoon Cassie had returned to the Bell, Book and Candle, with both Lizzie and Alex in tow. The bell above the door rang constantly as customers came and went through the shop all afternoon. Tara watched with fascination as Cassie tended to her children and the shop all with seamless ease. Currently, she was bouncing Elizabeth in one arm, selling tea with the other, and bringing it all to a close by directing her sale back to Tara at the register. A wave of relief and happiness ran through Cassie's face when she got a familiar feeling and Sam walked through the door. \"Sam,\" she said leaning in to kiss him. \"Hey,\" he said lingering in the kiss, then stroking his daughter's cheek. \"How has your day been?\" \"Busy. Grey House is fully booked and, as you can see, the Bell, Book is quite busy as well.\" \"I have the afternoon off from the hospital and no patients at the office. Do you want me to take Alexander home?\" he asked glancing at their son quietly playing behind the counter. \"Please. Our poor boy has been a gem this afternoon,\" she said with a tinge of guilt. \"But, Lizzie has demanded so much of my attention. Daddy-time would be a wonderful reward for him.\" Sam grinned. \"Ok, I'll take him home. We'll shoot some hoops or something.\" With kisses for the road from his wife and daughter, he went to his young son and took him into his arms. \"Hey sport, your Mama tells me you've been a good boy today.\" \"Mamama,\" Alex replied. \"Yeah, Mama's sorry she is busy today, but that means I get to teach you what all Radford's need to know—how to hit the perfect jump-shot.\" He waved good-bye to his wife and daughter, making his way back to Grey House. Pulling into his garage, Sam searched for the basketball. \"Baball,\" said Alex. \"Sorry son, we are going to have to find the basketball at Grey House. \"Howse,\" he repeated. Sam flew through the Bed and Breakfast, conversing with his son about names of the bones on his small hand, when he was brought to a halt by a familiar voice. \"Sam?\" the voice questioned. He stopped in his tracks and turned around slowly as if the person might not actually be there. She was. \"Linda, what are you doing here?\" he asked, clearly surprised at her presence in Middleton and Grey House. \"It's been awhile.\" \"Yes, it has,\" she agreed. \"Last time I was here you weren't married to your neighbour with two more children.\" Sam bit on the urge to snap back at her. He knew it would do no good. Instead he sat down, Alex on his lap and replied, \"You're right. And, my wife owns this place, so what are you doing here?\" Linda's demeanour suddenly changed. \"I'm here to see Nick, of course,\" she explained. \"Did you know he told me he doesn't want to see me anymore?\" Tears beginning to form in her eyes as she continued, \"I came here to speak with him, to fix things, to make sure he stays in my life.\" Sam nodded. \"Nick told us about his decision. I'm glad you've come to fix things with him. As much as he doesn't want to admit it right now, he needs you and loves you.\" \"Thank you, Sam, for understanding.\" \"Of course. You are part of his family.\" Alex played with his father's tie catching Linda's attention and curiosity. \"So this is…\" she paused, looking at the scene before her. \"My younger son, Alexander,\" Sam answered. \"Right. Yes. Your other son.\" \"Younger son,\" he responded firmly. \"There is no one or the other in my family. Only older and younger.\" \"Of course. Sorry,\" she apologised and after a moment added, \"You always wanted more kids. I am glad you got the chance to be a father again.\" \"Thank you,\" he said, bouncing Alex on his knee. \"Alex and Elizabeth were…unexpected surprises, but Cassie and I sure can't imagine our life without them.\" \"Then, I am happy for you, Sam. Really.\" Sam studied his ex for a moment. \"Thank you, Linda,\" he finally said. \"Nick usually gets back from university pretty late. I would try to catch him on campus, if I were you. He has a 10am anthropology class three days a week, but stays there for lunch.\" \"Ok, thanks for the info.\" \"Sure, and I hope you're able to make things right with our son.\" \"I plan on it.\" \"Good,\" Sam said getting up. \"Now, I need to continue teaching the next generation all there is to know about basketball.\" Linda smiled and waved good-bye as he continued his search for a ball. Quietly he said to himself, \"I forgive you, Linda.\"[Chapter 10] Later that night when sleep had taken over their younger children and study the older, Sam and Cassie sat on the couch holding each other close. Like many winter evenings, they cuddled together watching an old movie. This particular evening it happened to be one of their favourites, a romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Kim Novak. Sam particularly liked the fact that Stewart's character started as a neighbour to his love interest, just as he had. Whereas Cassie felt a certain kinship with the shop owner portrayed by Novak. They both loved the title of the film: Bell, Book and Candle. \"So, you didn't name the shop after the film?\" Sam asked with a slight smirk, as he did every time they watched the movie. \"No, Sam,\" she answered, as she did every time, giving him a slight nudge at the jest. \"I did not.\" \"Ok, but I am still not quite convinced,\" he chuckled. Cassie, simply shook her head at her husband's regular joke. Turning more serious he said, \"Oh, I, uh, literally stopped in my tracks today at Grey House when I thought I heard my ex-wife call my name.\" Cassie feigned a look of innocent surprise. \"Turns out, it actually was her.\" \"I didn't tell you she was staying next door?\" She asked innocently. \"No. You didn't.\" He deadpanned. \"Oh, I meant to, but must have forgotten with the shop being so busy, you know,\" she responded. \"Ah, ok, right\" Sam answered, knowing what she was doing. \"Well, I was certainly surprised.\" \"You spoke with her then?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"A full conversation which didn't end with me gritting my teeth, but actually, uh…forgiving her.\" \"You've forgiven Linda,\" Cassie exclaimed, genuinely surprised. She hadn't seen that coming and loved how Sam could surprise her in just about every way. \"Yeah. How many years ago was it now that you told me I should,\" he asked rhetorically. \"Can't say I didn't listen to you,\" he said smiling. \"Granted, it wasn't to her face, but it still happened and I can admit that it actually feels good.\" Cassie put her arms around her husband. \"I'm glad and I'm proud of you,\" she said giving him a peck on the lips. \"My wife is proud of me,\" Sam smiled. \"What more could a husband want?\" \"To finish one of our favourite movies in each other's arms?\" she suggested. Sam simply nodded and hit 'play' on the remote. Cassie, listening to Stewart and Novak and wrapped in her husband's arms, could only hope her step-son wouldn't take as long in forgiving his mother. The light of the early morning crept through the curtains of Sam and Cassie's room and the language of a one-year-old came through the baby monitor, waking a mother and father from their slumber. Sam felt his wife begin to move. \"No, no, no, I'll go,\" he said unravelling himself from her, and slowly making his way towards the children's room. Elizabeth had woken up and was sitting up in bed holding a conversation with herself while her twin continued to sleep soundly. \"Hey princess good morning, let's go see Mama so you won't wake your brother,\" he said taking her out of the crib and going to the kitchen where he knew Cassie would be before heading to Grey House to serve breakfast. He reached the kitchen, their daughter in his arms, and Cassie making coffee, tea and a bottle. She grinned knowing her husband and younger daughter were heading her way. Their family morning routine had begun. \"Good morning, my love,\" Sam said taking the coffee in one hand, while still holding their daughter in his other arm. Cassie pulled him in for a morning kiss. \"Good morning, handsome,\" she said after their lips parted. \"And, good morning, my sweet pea,\" kissing their daughter on the forehead. Taking Elizabeth, she put her in the high chair and gave her a bottle and bits of a banana. \"So, Cassie,\" Sam said in between sips of coffee. \"I'm sorry, but I won't be able to help out at Grey House this morning because it is the only time we could schedule a meeting with all the department heads at Hillcrest.\" Since the beginning of their marriage Sam helped her with breakfast preparation for Grey House guests; a way to make up for all the food he ate while they were dating, he had said jokingly. Cassie suspected it was just another way to for him to spend time with her and, really, she loved working together with her husband—in any capacity. \"That's alright. I think I'll be ok,\" she said, a particular look forming on her face. Sam poured himself another cup of coffee and sat down next to his daughter, urging her to eat. Grace walked into the kitchen, Nick not far behind her. \"Good morning Mom, Sam,\" Grace said cheerily, passing by her parents. \"Good Morning, little sister,\" giving her a shake of her small hand. \"Morning Dad, Cassie,\" Nick said sleepily. Clearly not quite awake yet. \"Morning little Lizzie.\" Sam and Cassie looked at each other, silently amused by their older children. \"Hey, can either of you help Cassie out at Grey House this morning?\" He asked. \"Sam…\" Cassie interjected after reading the looks from Grace and Nick. \"Uh, sorry,\" Grace quickly answered. \"I've got an 8am biology class. Can't miss. Gotta go.\" Giving a quick peck on the cheek to each of her parents and sister, she headed out the door. Nick's eyes shifted between his father and step-mother. \"Ok,\" he said slightly reluctant. \"What do you need, Cassie?\" A cry rang out from down the hall. \"I'll get Alex,\" Sam volunteered. \"Thank you,\" she said caressing his arm as he passed. Turning her attention back to Nick, \"All I need is for you to set everything up. George is there to help after he goes to the Bistro. As soon as your Dad and I get the twins ready, I will be there.\" \"No problem.\" \"Thanks Nick,\" Cassie said as Nick headed toward the front door and Sam entered with Alex in his arms. \"You think that was a good idea,\" he asked his wife as he set Alex next to his sister. \"And whose idea was it?\" She retorted, wrapping one arm around him and caressing her son with the other. \"Yeah, I've been around you way too long,\" he grinned. \"And, I couldn't be any happier,\" she answered, kissing him quickly before they both got back to feeding their kids. Nick made the short trip to Grey House. Walking through the backdoor of the kitchen, he saw George. \"Hey there, Nick!\" George exclaimed. \"Hey,\" he answered. \"Are you helping your Dad and Cassie out this morning?\" \"Actually, I am filling in for my Dad. He's got something at the hospital early this morning.\" \"Ah, well, I am making a trip to the Bistro for pastries and muffins. I'll be back,\" he said taking his coat and heading out the door. Nick smiled and opened cupboards to gather the dishware for guests. Plates, glasses, mugs, cutlery were all soon set out ready for use. He stepped back to admire his work; he was actually enjoying what he was doing. Deciding to continue, he went to the refrigerator to gather the items Cassie had placed there the night before and began to cut fruit just as he had seen her do many times before. He had just set out a bowl of melons when he turned around to find himself face to face with his mother. \"Mom, what are you doing here?!\" \"What do you think, Nicky? I am here to see you. We need to talk.\" \"No. No, we don't. You have said enough. I…I can't even…\" Not even finishing his thought, he stormed out of the house Back next door, Sam was saying good-bye to his wife and the twins for the day. \"Sorry, I can't help you with breakfast.\" \"That's ok, Sam. It's not like meetings like this happen every day.\" \"No, they don't. Not if I can help it,\" he grinned, kissing his wife and kids good-bye. Just as he was about to get in the car, Nick stopped in front of his parents. \"You knew,\" he said, looking back and forth between his father and step-mother. \"You both knew. How could you? Both of you.\" Watching Nick head towards the house, Sam and Cassie sighed heavily. \"Now I am really sorry I have to go,\" Sam said, his voice full of regret. \"Don't worry. Let him cool off. He always does,\" Cassie said as he got in his Jeep. \"Yeah, you're right,\" he agreed. \"Have a good day. I love you.\" \"Love you more.\" \"Love you all the most,\" he smiled, waving at Cassie, Alex and Liz as he drove away. , \"Come on, you two,\" she told her kids. \"Let's go to Grey House.\" \"Howse!\" they both replied happily. George had returned from the Bistro a few minutes after Cassie arrived at Grey House, Elizabeth and Alexander contently playing together around her. \"Nick was here earlier helping out,\" he said. \"Yeah. Sam and I saw him head back to the house,\" she said, a bit deflated. Just then Linda walked in with an empty plate of food. \"Linda,\" Cassie said. \"Cassie.\" George knew his cue to let the two women talk. \"Um, Cassie, I'll just take the tykes upstairs to the sitting room and read them a story.\" \"That sounds perfect, George. Thank you.\" Cassie turned back to Linda. \"Sam and I ran into Nick outside.\" \"Yeah, I came downstairs for breakfast. He wasn't happy to see me. You and Sam didn't tell him I was here, I take it.\" Cassie shook her head. \"No, we didn't. We actually hoped he would run into you and you might be able to talk.\" \"Thank you, but it didn't work,\" Linda said disheartened. \"Now that he knows, he will certainly avoid Grey House.\" \"Well, don't you avoid him.\" \"Right, yes. Sam mentioned his university courses.\" \"Yeah,\" Cassie said getting a look in her eyes, completely missed by Linda. \"I think I will take a wander around town today. I have to know what to say once I have his attention.\" \"I've always found the truth is the best place to start,\" Cassie suggested. \"I'm not sure that will help.\" \"You never know,\" she said with a knowing look. \"Well, as all is set down here, I'd better help George out. Alex and Elizabeth can be a handful.\" \"Cassie,\" Linda interjected as Cassie began toward the stairs. \"I know I haven't always been…well, let's face it civil with you and...I'm sorry,\" she said truthfully. \"Linda…\" Cassie began. \"No, no please. I have had a lot of time to do a lot of thinking and I know that from day one even before you and Sam were…married…you were there for Nick.\" Cassie could see how difficult that had been for Linda. \"Ah well, it's really no problem and it's always been my pleasure. He's a good kid and a wonderful step-son. I'm proud to have him as part of my family.\" Linda nodded and managed a small smile, \"Well, thank you…for being here for him.\" \"Sure,\" she said placing a hand on her shoulder as she went towards the stairs. Linda knew from her how her son talked about his family in Middleton that they were important to him. At first she was jealous, but now she finally realised that her ex-husband and his wife were, in fact, intent on keeping the connection between herself and her son open.[Chapter 11] A/N: Thanks to those who have left comments! Always encouraging and glad to know it is being enjoyed not only by me ;) On with the story… The next few hours had passed with relative calm in Grey House. The twins went down for their nap after games and stories with their mother and honorary grandpa. Cassie now sat in the calm, sipping tea as she caught up on Grey House business. She had just gotten up for a refill when Brandon walked through the door. \"Hello Brandon,\" she said smiling. \"Hi Cassie,\" he said hugging her. She was as proud of Brandon as she was of all of her children. Most of the family had been concerned when he began working for the Middleton Police department, but she was sure his mother and father were just as proud about how their son's life has turned out. He was working his way up the ranks, following in Jake's footsteps, and she felt he would become chief one day, just like his father. \"So, how are things?\" Brandon asked trying, unsuccessfully, to sounds casual. He had been worried about his family ever since he had run into Sam and Cassie with Tara. Cassie's pride swelled even more as Brandon's protectiveness for his family so clearly, and easily, extended to Sam, Nick and the twins. \"Well, not much has changed for the better since we last saw you.\" \"Ah, sorry.\" Brandon sat on the kitchen barstool, picking up a scone and began picking at it. \"Mmhm, and to make matters a bit more sticky, Linda is in town. Sam and I thought it might be good to get him to encounter her here, uhm, unexpectedly…\" \"And, that didn't work,\" Brandon finished. \"No, it didn't.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that, Cassie. I wish I could help you guys out.\" \"Actually, Brandon,\" she said. \"Could you do me a favour and get these textbooks to Grace and Nick at the university?\" She took some course books from the next counter. \"Sorry, to ask this on your day off. The twins are asleep and I think Nick and Grace really need these for their next class\" \"No, that's ok. If you think it will help…\" \"Oh, it will,\" she said, a small smile on her face. \"Ok. I'll get right on it then.\" \"Thanks, Brandon,\" she said as he grabbed the books and headed out. Linda strolled down Middleton's Main Street. The town hadn't changed that much since she had visited all those years ago, even if so much else had. She passed shops that were familiar and others which were not. Looking through the window of the Bell, Book and Candle, her encounters with Cassie came flooding back. What was I thinking, she thought to herself . She had seen the connection between Sam and Cassie. She had even told them, and yet she still tried to keep them apart. Suddenly she realised just how wrong and futile all those attempts had been. Walking further along she noted the Bistro. Still the only real restaurant in town , she thought. The interior seemed to have doubled in size from the last time she had been there and large, leather couches replaced the tables that had once graced the front space of the eatery. It was just about lunchtime and a rush had already begun. At the counter she saw a familiar face talking rather intimately with the women behind the counter. \"Liam,\" she said approaching him. Sam's friend turned around, surprised by who he saw. \"Linda! What are you doing here? Do Sam and Cassie know?\" he said in surprise. \"Yes, Liam, they both are aware of my presence here,\" she answered, slightly annoyed. \"I am staying at Grey House.\" He wasn't going to seek any further explanation from his best friend's ex. He would catch up with Sam later and grill him instead. \"So, you've made the move to Middleton too,\" Linda stated. Liam only nodded in response. \"Sarah had told me you moved to the Midwest with Noah, but she just couldn't remember the name of the town.\" \"Well, Sarah and I haven't been in much contact since her marriage to Jason. She only stays in touch with Noah, really.\" Liam said simply. \"Right,\" she paused for moment, then continued. \"She said he's at Fordham on a full baseball scholarship. You must be proud,\" she said. \"I am,\" Liam smiled. \"You're still friends with Sarah, then?\" \"Of course,\" Linda said, surprised by the question. \"We all did spend some time together back in the day.\" \"Yeah, I guess we did. How some things change, huh…\" he said poignantly. Just then Stephanie appeared looking from Liam to Linda. \"Linda, this is my fiancée, Stephanie. Sweetheart, this is Linda…Sam's ex-wife.\" \"Oh, hello,\" Stephanie said, her voice thick with reserve. \"I recall you came to town a few years ago, but I don't think we ever formally met.\" \"No, I don't think so. I came into the Bistro once, but one of your employees treated me quite rudely,\" Linda said looking around. \"But, I see she no longer works here.\" Stephanie stifled a laughed, but a small grin spread across her face. Abigail , she thought. \"Well, feel free to look at the menu,\" she said giving Linda a menu and pulling Liam off the stool and around the corner. \"What is she doing here?!\" Liam shrugged his shoulders. Linda had been one of the many reasons Stephanie decided to give up on pursuing a relationship with Sam when he first arrived in Middleton. From what she had heard through the grapevine, she wasn't thrilled to see her back and talking with her fiancé. Liam, sensing Stephanie's distress, said, \"Stephanie, don't worry. Sam and I have been friends a long time and that means we know our exes quite well. She is still friends with Sarah. This was just chit-chat. She is obviously here for a particular purpose and I am going to find out from Sam as soon as can.\" She let her guard and worry down. \"Alright, but I've got my eye on her.\" \"I do too, Sweetie, I do too\" he said smiling and giving her a kiss. They both returned to the front counter and Stephanie took Linda's order while Liam headed back to the brewery. Grace and Nick sat in the university student union. When their schedules permitted, they met for a lunch break. \"I just can't believe it, Grace,\" Nick vented. \"What were our parents thinking?\" He had updated her on the unexpected encounter with his mother at Grey House and subsequent frustration with their parents. \"Mom and Sam, are only trying to help, Nick, you know that,\" Grace rationalised. \"You do realise that not speaking to your Mom…\" \"Grace, please,\" he cut her off sharply. \"I know,\" he added, more calmly. \"Right, ok,\" Grace relented. She had learned to tread softly with her step-brother on some topics. \"Just don't be mad at them,\" she stressed. \"Our parents love you…we all do…and they want to do what's best.\" \"I'm not mad at them.\" \"Good,\" she said, her hand rubbing her step-brother's shoulder. As their class time drew close, Nick rummaged through his bag. \"Oh, brilliant,\" he exclaimed. \"I must have left my book for Professor Dover's class at home. I could have sworn I had it. I made notes in it.\" \"Oh, you don't need notes for your Archaeology class. You know that stuff inside and out.\" \"Yeah, maybe,\" Nick smiled at the compliment and continued rummaging. \"But, I still like to have them and could have sworn I had it.\" \"Uh, Nick,\" Grace questioned. \"What time is your next class again?\" \"Aw, crap, I'm going to be late if I don't hurry,\" Nick said glancing at his phone's clock. \"I gotta go, sis. See you at home.\" \"At home,\" Grace repeated as Nick raced out the door. Going to her bag, Grace rummaged through it and realised her Anatomy book was missing as well, and she would have bet that she had placed it there last night before she went to bed. Brandon pulled into a parking spot. A trip to the state university in Blairsville wasn't what he had planned on doing on his day off, but he was always happy to help Cassie and it seemed there was always another reason for an errand given by her. He knew it was a stressful time for his step-mother's family so he was happy to help in any way he could. With Sam's ex-wife staying at Grey House, and Cassie saying that there was some kind of strife between mother and son he knew something was definitely wrong, but everyone was keeping the details unusually close. He walked onto the snowy campus. Suddenly he realised Cassie had not given him any information on Grace's schedule and he wouldn't be able to give her the books without it. He began to text Grace when he suddenly heard someone cry out. \"Watch out!\" He looked up just in time to see Nick slip on a patch of ice and was currently sliding toward him at quite a speed. Brandon braced himself, but it was too late and Cassie's step-sons both found themselves on the cold, hard ground. A small crowd gathered, making sure the two fallen 'brothers' were alright. They ensured the bystanders they were fine as they both brushed off snow and dirt from their clothing and checked for scrapes. \"I'm so sorry, Brandon. I'm late for my archaeology class, it's all the way across campus, and I wasn't looking were I was going…\" Nick rambled. \"Nick, Nick,\" Brandon said in an attempt to get him to stop talking. \"It's alright besides it looks like you might miss it anyway. We should get you to the student medical centre to get yourself checked out.\" \"No, no. I'm fine. I swear.\" \"Ok, but be sure to tell your Dad and Cassie if you're not feeling well,\" Brandon said reluctantly. \"Right,\" Nick said looking at the clock on his phone. \"Well by the time I make it to class it will be halfway over and not worth it. Damn.\" \"Sorry you've missed your class.\" \"Oh, it's not really a problem,\" Nick answered. \"I can ask my classmates for notes or speak with Professor Dover.\" \"Well, then why don't we grab a coffee, maybe some food? I'll buy. Besides I've got a couple things from Cassie that I am sure you and Grace will be happy to have,\" Brandon pulled the textbooks out of his bag. \"Huh, I could have sworn I put that in my bag.\" \"Yeah, apparently you two would leave your heads behind if they weren't attached to your body.\" Brandon pat Nick on the back and handed him his course book as they headed toward the student café. \"Thanks Brandon,\" Nick said holding up the cup of coffee in gratitude. Looking at Nick, Brandon could see why Sam and Cassie were concerned; he looked as if he were half a world away. \"Oh, I hear your Mom is visiting,\" Brandon said breaking the silence while nudging Nick for information. \"That must be nice.\" Nick looked up from his coffee, \"No, not really. She and I aren't…really…getting along at the moment. In fact, I wish she would just leave, get out of my life.\" Then it hit Brandon. He knew why Cassie had sent him on this particular errand. It was more than textbooks. \"You know Nick, in my eyes you're quite a lucky guy.\" Nick wasn't feeling particularly lucky. \"Yeah?\" he challenged. \"How's that.\" \"You have both your mother and father. Granted, they've been divorced for a long time and that couldn't have been easy, but just think about it, at least you have them …\" Brandon let the words hang a bit. The silence encouraged him to continue; maybe Nick was listening. \"I mean Lori and me, we had our Dad and then Cassie came along not too long after our mother passed away. And, we were both living our own lives by the time our Dad died, but that doesn't mean we don't miss them every single day and wish they were here to see how our lives have turned out.\" Nick felt foolish. He hadn't even considered that he had both his mother and father, alive. \"I'm sorry. I didn't even think…I don't even want to imagine what it would be like if my Dad, or even my Mom really, were gone. For good. And Grace, I remember when she told me that her Dad had died.\" Brandon sighed heavily. \"Yeah, it's not easy. Like I said, Lori and I were lucky that we had Cassie, and Grace is lucky she has Sam.\" \"Yeah, I guess she is,\" he responded absent-mindedly. \"It has taught me that you can't take your family for granted; any of them.\" Nick sat silent. Brandon felt like he could see the young man thinking and considering his words as lines seemed to form on his forehead. \"Thanks, Brandon,\" he finally said. \"Hey, what is a step-brother, once removed, for\" he said with a grin, getting up from the table. \"Take care, Nick. And, please, have your Dad take a look at you. I may stop by to see him too, just to be sure.\" With that he patted Nick on the shoulder and left him to his thoughts. It was time for him to find Grace and finish his errand, though he figured he had already done the bulk of it already. If he could help Nick in some small way, he thought, it was all worth it.[Chapter 12] Thanks again to those who comment! It does keep one writing. Here it is. The chapter. The last chapter I actually wrote (yet not the last of the story). I wrote it last because I had to see where the story was taking me, where Linda took me really—. I knew how I wanted this all to play out, but I wasn't quite sure how to get there until everything else had been written. It has certainly turned out to be longer than I expected! I hope it stays true to both the characters of Nick and Linda as we know them from the series, but also shows something new in each. The next day Linda walked along the snowy campus, thinking about what Liam had said—how things had changed. She had apologised to Sam and Cassie, and that felt right. Now to fix things with her son. The change in Nick hadn't escaped her. She had noticed it almost from his first visit to see her in New York. Slowly but surely he was accepting, even enjoying, his life in Middleton. During those visits he would update her on his life: a two week trip to the Maldives to help on an archaeological dig, Cassie and Sam dating, Halloween Harvest and Lights festivals, Cassie and Sam's engagement and marriage, his decision to stay near Middleton for university, and the arrival of his twin siblings. It was hard, at first, for her not be just a little jealous of her ex-husband's new life and how her son's affinity for Middleton grew, yet she also knew he appreciated their time in New York—until a few weeks ago, that is. According to the schedule Sam gave her, Nick's Biological Anthropology class was just about finished. They wouldsit down and talk she had decided. She came upon Douglas Hall, a main campus building, and watched as students filed in and out. Only a few minutes had passed before she saw Nick and a girl walk out of the building. \"Nicky,\" she called out. \"Can we talk?\" Nick was, once again, surprised to see his mother, but not completely taken aback. He had had a long conversation with his parents and they had both suggested he, at least, hear his mother out before going through with his plan to cut ties between them. This was as good as time as any, he concluded. \"Uh, Molly, I gotta talk with my Mom. I'll catch up with you at the gym later.\" \"Sure, Nick. See you,\" she said smiling. Linda approached Nick as if he might flee if she came up too quickly. \"Mom, what are you doing here?\" \"Like I said, we need to talk and I am not leaving until we do,\" she said, determined. \"Fine,\" he reluctantly answered. \"I have some time.\" They walked toward the Student Union, snow falling and students rambling all around them. Each taking a seat with a cup of coffee, Nick stared at his mother. \"Well,\" he asked. \"Well,\" she said in return. \"Nicky, what is all this? Where is this coming from?\" Nick laughed and shook his head. \"You still don't know. You have no real idea?!\" \"No, of course I get that you're angry about what Geoffrey did on New Year's Eve and that you are upset that your father and I didn't tell you the full truth about how your custody was decided...\" \"No Mom!\" He cut her off somewhat loudly. \"Dad may not have told me the full truth , but you…you flat out lied. Dad never stole me from you, bullied youlike you said. Why? Why did you lie?\" A silence lingered between them. Nick continued, \"Why did you give Dad full custody?\" And finally, almost pleading with her for an answer. \"Why did you let me go?\" Linda looked at him. She saw the pain and confusion of a little boy in the face of her grown son. Her heart went out to him. Reaching out and taking his hands, she said somewhat rhetorically, \"Oh Nick, how do I start this so you will understand?\" \"Start with the truth,\" he answered simply. \"Well,\" she considered, \"as unreal as it may sound, your Dad and I did actually get along at one point in our lives.\" \"Yeah, he has said as much to me,\" Nick confirmed. Linda nodded. \"Yes, well, we were young, newly married in New York and both focused on our careers. Your Dad in the hospital and me working my way up in mergers and finance. Both of us actually making quite the waves in our respective jobs,\" she recalled smiling. Perhaps, she considered silently, that their differences had already begun as early as that early success, but she quickly put it out of her mind. \"And, when did I come in?\" Nick asked, bringing Linda out of her thoughts. \"You, well you came in a couple years later,\" she smiled. \"When you were both beginning to 'make waves', as you put it.\" \"Yes…and no. I mean we were doing well financially. You had all the best toys, clothes, stroller, whatever was 'in' at the time, you had it,\" she said, a slight look of pride forming on her face. \"Whoopee for me,\" he said, unimpressed. \"Nick,\" she scolded. \"Mom,\" he retorted. \"I was a baby. I can tell you I didn't care, I don't even remember, that I had the best crib or whatever, but obviously you did.\" \"Parents' prerogative,\" she tried to joke. Nick's eyes rolled. \"You have to know you brought great joy to our lives, Nicky. Nothing you did caused our divorce.\" \"I know. Dad told me that a lot when I was little.\" \"Well, it's the truth.\" \"Then why did you choose London over me?\" he persisted. \"It's not that simple,\" she said. \"It is for me, Mom!\" he said loudly. Linda looked around, but no one seemed to notice, to her relief. \"Your Dad and I, in the end, wanted different things. Opportunities for growth at my job were booming. I was getting more projects, more responsibilities. I simply didn't want to let these chances pass me by, and your father and I began to…disagree…on how to move forward.\" Nick sat quietly not saying anything, but taking in every word. She continued. \"As time went along things seemed to get more difficult. Our disagreements turned into arguments, arguments turned into fights, and they…well, that led to…\" Linda couldn't finish. There wasn't more she felt Nick needed to know. \"The divorce. No custody issues.\" Nick finished for her. \"Nicky, London came along when it should have. You probably don't remember much, but towards the end things were not fun.\" \"Oh, I remember Mom. You'd be surprised how much I remember,\" Nick said. \"It seemed like you and Dad were always fighting.\" \"Yes, well, as I said London came along at the right time,\" she took a deep breath, \"It was…\" \"It was…\" he repeated. \"It was the best way to settle things between your father and me, really. The best choice to finish a bad situation.\" \"A bad situation,\" Nick echoed his mother again. \"It was a once in a lifetime career opportunity and it solved a lot. The only awful part of the whole scenario was leaving you.\" Nick continued to just sit, in silence, as if in shock. \"The best choice out of a bad situation, Mom,\" he finally said. \"Is that all I was a 'bad situation'.\" \"No, no, not you. You're not understanding.\" \"What I understand, what I see, is that you were…selfish,\" Nick began getting up from his chair. \"You were fighting with your husband, going through a bad divorce, trying to figure what to do with a child who was cramping your style and then here comes this 'job opportunity' and it solved everything.\" He shoved the chair back in its place. \"So, you thought why I don't just take this job, leave my son in his father's custody, and problem solved!\" He said angrily. \"That's not true. That never…\" Linda began, but she was cut off. \"No, more explanations please,\" Nick said beginning to walk away. \"Nicky…\" \"And, don't call me Nicky. It's Nick!\" With that final request, he walked out of the cafeteria, a few on-lookers whispering to themselves. Linda got up slowly, tears on the verge of spilling, leaving the witnesses to their speculation. Once out the door, Nick began to run, hard and fast. He hadn't run like this since his mother and father's divorce. He didn't know where he was running, he just ran. He ran off campus and into nearby woods. Finally, he slowed down as he crossed a wooden footbridge over a small creek that led to a magnificent waterfall. Not being a hiker of any sort, he wasn't familiar with the natural beauty that surrounded the area. He decided to stop and admire the site when he turned and was suddenly face to face with Abigail.[Chapter 13] \"Hey Nick,\" she said in typical Abigail fashion. \"Abigail,\" he said with a Sam-like quality that made her burst out in laughter. \"That is exactly how your Dad used to say my name when he was slightly annoyed with me. Usually because I had interrupted a moment with Cassie,\" she reflected. \"Ah, well I understand the feeling, but probably not for the same reason,\" he smirked. \"Right. So, how have I annoyed this particular Radford?\" she asked amused. \"I just want to be alone right now, Abigail.\" \"Sorry, Nick,\" she said more seriously. \"You're related to Merriwicks now. Don't you know we never leave people we care about alone?\" Nick smiled a bit and crossed the bridge sitting on a nearby bench overlooking the falls. Abigail followed. \"You know, you and I have something in common,\" she said as a matter of fact. \"We do?\" he said doubtfully. \"We do,\" she reaffirmed. \"We both have a parent who let us go.\" Nick looked at her realising what she meant. He had heard of the return of her father after 22 years. Though he was fighting with his step-sister at the time, his father had kept him up to speed on what was happening next door. \"Yeah, I guess you're right,\" he acknowledged. \"Your dad had left you, didn't he? Just like my mom left me.\" \"Yeah, my Dad, like your Mom, made a conscious decision to let me go.\" \"So, you understand why I want nothing to do with my Mom. You get it!\" \"I do Nick. I even told people he was dead.\" Nick nodded. Happy that someone finally seemed to understand how he felt. \"But,\" she continued. \"The best decision I made was to eventually mend that fence because I knew I would regret it if I went through the rest of my life without a father, even if it took me a while to get over what he did.\" \"My Mom lied. Her job was more important than her son,\" Nick explained. \"Yeah, my Dad had lied as well and couldn't even be completely honest when he returned, but I still eventually forgave him. Our relationship isn't perfect, but I have him in my life, if I want.\" She put her hand on Nick's shoulder. \"After my mother died, I had neither parent, but you, you've got a lot. Don't exclude your mom from your family circle simply because of the past. You will end up regretting it if you do. Take it from someone who knows.\" She got up and began to make her way down the rest of the path. \"Abigail,\" Nick called out. \"Was it worth it? Forgiving your father?\" \"Forgiveness is always worth it.\" After her confrontation with Nick and a long walk, Linda had returned to Grey House recomposed. Upon entering she noted Sam, Cassie and other members of the extended family deep in discussion. Sam approached her, Elizabeth in his arms. \"Linda, what happened?!\" He questioned. \"Grace said she heard from a friend of Nick's who said he cancelled meeting her today, and he never does that.\" \"Sam, I tried. I tried to explain everything he wanted to know—truthfully—but it didn't work.\" She explained, tears on the verge of falling again. \"Where is he?\" Sam pressed on, as Cassie came up behind him with Alexander. \"I don't know, but he wants me to go, so I think maybe…I should,\" she said sadly. Cassie looked to Sam hopefully despite Linda's words. \"Thank you both,\" she said honestly. \"I think I'm too late. We've done all we could.\" With those words, she went upstairs. Cassie and Sam looked back to the rest of the family looking concerned, all save for Abigail. Nick looked to the waterfall taking in Abigail's words realising they sounded a lot like something his step-mother would say. When he turned to thank her, she was already gone as if she disappeared into thin air. He sat back down on the bench and looked around him—he had learned to love the small, Midwestern town his father had dragged him to all those years ago. Middleton was his home, he knew this now. Lost in thought, he considered Anthony, who had faced a custody battle between two parents, never really feeling at home with either. He thought about Brandon and Lori, who had lost both their mother and father. And finally, about Abigail whose father had also left, yet she still found it possible to forgive him. Then he considered himself: he was raised by a loving father who put him first, and because of his mother's decision never went through a custody battle. He now had a wonderful new family that made him happy and, he knew, loved him. And, he had both his mother and father who loved him each in their own way, even though they weren't together. Nick realised he was pretty lucky and his life had been pretty good so far. Perhaps what his mother had done had been a bit selfish, but in the end, everything turned out as it should have—for the best. In an instant he was running towards his home, hoping he would be able to stop his mom from leaving, possibly for good. He returned to the end of Grey House's driveway. His father and step-mother were talking to his mother. Behind them a few yards away on the steps of the B&B;, he saw the others. They were all there, all of his family. Sam and Cassie were attempting to convince Linda to not give up on fixing things with Nick, but weren't having any luck when Nick ran towards them. Upon seeing him, Sam and Cassie retreated to join the rest of the family. \"Mom wait!\" He said, almost out of breath. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. Don't go…not yet.\" \"Oh no Nick,\" Linda said. \"I'm the one who's truly sorry. I should have been honest with you. I shouldn't have let Geoffrey say that like he did. I should have…been a better mother.\" Nick sighed. \"Mom, you did what you thought was best for you and for me. And…it's ok. Everything turned out ok.\" The worry faded from Linda's face. \"Though,\" he added, a small smirk on his face. \"I could have really done without Geoffrey spilling the beans the way he did.\" \"You're right. Geoffrey had no right to tell you that. Your mother and father should have, and we're both sorry we didn't do that,\" she said glancing at Sam. \"I know I am not a perfect mother Nick, but I do love you.\" \"I know. I love you too. And, you can call me 'Nicky' if you want. Only you,\" he said giving his signature sideways grin. Linda wiped the tears that had been falling and embraced her son. It was the longest hug Nick remembered receiving in recent years. They separated and she said, \"I'll call you when I get back to New York?\" Nick nodded. \"Yeah, do. Bye Mom.\" \"Bye Nicky,\" she said kissing him on his forehead then getting in her car. As she drove away, he watched her car leave the driveway, once again. Turning around, he saw the rest of his family waiting for him and he smiled happily, bounding up the stairs to join them. Sam lagged behind, his daughter in his arms, waiting for Nick \"Are you alright?\" he asked seriously, the last time Linda had driven out of his older son's life clearly on his mind. \"Yeah Dad, I am. I realised I am very lucky to have my family. All my family,\" he said giving a knowing smile to his father and tickling his little sister and making her laugh instantly. Sam and Nick joined Elizabeth in her laughter and the rest of their family as they all gathered together inside their Grey House.[Chapter 14] AN: I couldn't end it there. One more look at Nick, Grace, Cassie, Sam, and the Radford twins. Epilogue: In late summer, the lake glistened in the August sun reflecting the clear blue sky above. The colours of the summer leaves and grass surrounding the Radford lake house like a comfortable carpet. Boats, water skies, and all forms of aquatic entertainment spattered about on the water. Nick and Grace pulled up next to the house, happy to have finally made it to their destination and excited for what was to come during their family vacation. He couldn't wait to get out on the boat with his Dad and brother, and she was looking forward to some quality Merriwick-time with her Mom and little sister before her big move. They were both looking forward to the family evenings beside the outdoor fire pit eating hot dogs or marshmallows while Sam played a song on the guitar, everyone singing along. The last few months had been a busy time in their household and every member of the family was looking forward to some time away from the daily grind. \"Well, I guess we beat our parents here,\" Nick said looking out across the lake. \"Yeah, I imagine a car ride with two four-year olds isn't the easiest,\" Grace reflected. \"Alex is fine, but Elizabeth knows how to push his buttons, even at this age.\" They both laughed and went to work unloading the car. \"Nick?\" Grace called out from her room upstairs in the house. She went across the hall and glanced through his open door only to find his room empty. Going downstairs she called again, \"Nick!\" All the work being done, she looked out at the view of the lake and found what she was looking for outside. Nick sat at the dock. Shoes off, his feet dangling just enough to touch the cool lake water below. He loved the view and the memories it already brought back. It felt like he had just been there a few minutes when he heard a voice behind him, \"Hey, bro.\" Grace was sat beside him. \"Hey sis,\" he smiled. \"All unpacked?\" \"Yep,\" she affirmed, proudly. \"All done.\" \"I was just thinking of the first time we came up here with our folks,\" he said looking nostalgic. \"Yeah. Parents engaged, you and I doing our best to avoid each other…fun times\" Grace recalled and joked. \"And not being able to do that very well, if I remember,\" Nick chuckled and paused thoughfully for a moment. \"You came to rescue me from being stranded at Turtle Point. You sure saved my skin that night.\" \"You've done the same once or twice for me too.\" Nick nodded. Turning to face his step-sister, he said, \"You know, you have been the best friend, and sister, a guy could have.\" Grace blushed, slightly embarrassed. Nick wasn't one for having his heart on his sleeve so she knew he was sincere. He continued, \"I…I'm going to miss you while you're at Georgetown. What will I do without all your…magic,\" he said with a knowing smile. \"You will do fine. I know this.\" \"Yeah? You think so,\" he questioned. She nodded positively. \"Well, you too. I have my own Jedi-like instincts and I can see you're anxious about leaving Middleton.\" Grace looked down into the water swishing her feet back and forth. \"You are going to do great, Grace. Medical school and a Master's degree specialising in…what was it?\" \"Integrative medicine. Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\" \"Yeah that, Dr. Russell. Our parents are sure proud. We all are.\" \"Thanks Nick,\" she smiled. \"And you, you were so keen to leave Middleton when we first met and now…\" \"I know, I'm the one staying,\" he acknowledged. \"I realised a while back that Middleton is my home. My family is here and Molly is too. Moving here was the best decision my Dad ever made, second to marrying your Mom of course. I'm glad he did both.\" Grace smiled at her step-brother's admission. \"I think I will be quite happy taking on some work at Grey House, now that it is becoming a bit harder for George to get around and working with Professor Dover in the archaeology department at the university for a while…after my trip to New York with Molly.\" \"Ah, introducing your girlfriend to your mother. Big step.\" Grace joked. \"Yeah, Molly has been warned,\" he added smiling. \"The more things change…\" Grace said. \"Nick! Grace!\" Two small voices called out from the distance. They turned around to see their two younger siblings bounding towards them. They got up and met them halfway, Nick lifting his little brother in the air and Grace sweeping up her little sister with a kiss. They all went into the house and saw Sam and Cassie, settling in themselves. \"Ah, there are all four of our wonderful children,\" Sam said smiling as he walked up to the main room from downstairs, Cassie just behind him. Beaming she said, \"They couldn't wait to see you guys. They're crazy about their big brother and sister.\" \"Then it is good we came. Mom, you and Sam need any more help?\" \"Nope, we have everything handled, but perhaps if you two could hang out a bit longer with your siblings, it would make things a lot easier,\" Cassie hinted. \"Sure Cassie,\" Nick responded looking at Grace. \"Why don't we show these two the joys of gaming?\" \"Ok, bros, you're on!\" Grace challenged. \"And, the girls are taking you down.\" Sam and Cassie laughed and smiled at each other as their kids left the room. \"I love our family,\" she said sighing. \"I couldn't have said it better myself,\" Sam kissed her and went outside to prep the fire pit for their traditional first-night dinner: hot dogs. Later that night, the stars blanketed the sky and a crackling fire illuminated the yard of the lake house. The family of six sat around the fire roasting marshmallows and singing well into the night. Cassie smiled knowing that the following days would bring new memories and happy times for her family. Fin. Author's note: Grace's program of study at Georgetown actually exists. I did some research thinking that something like this had to be possible. Curious? Here is a link: .edu/about-the-program. ","Summary":" Good Witch: A New York Minute The New York City skyline sparkled outside the window. Voices, laught"},{"Movie":"Good Witch","Title":"Good Witch - Nick and Grace Come to Town","Author":"Daniel Sullivan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13172932","Passage":"[Chapter 1] May, 2018 – Somewhere in the Antioquia Province, Colombia It was the perfect storm. Somehow, Grace Lashield had wound up right in the middle of it. She pulled the special forces coin from her pocket, a reminder of a hellish time she had lived through more than two decades earlier. If she could live through that, then she could certainly make it through this, bad as it was. Heavy rains combined with a disaster at the Hidroituango Dam on the Cauca River caused massive flooding downstream, displacing thousands of people, and triggering mass evacuations. Continued rains had precipitated landslides that further complicated the matter. Relief agencies worked round the clock to evacuate people, but they could only do so much. Armed groups operated in the area, only adding to the dangers. Grace Lashield had signed on with one of the relief agencies that worked to evacuate the locals. It was a challenging and dangerous job. But, compared to the hell she experienced in the South China Sea twenty-four years ago, this was a cakewalk. So far, none of the armed groups in the area had interfered in the evacuations. Grace suspected that they were more concerned with not becoming victims of this disaster, though the idea of mercenaries raiding relief agencies for medical supplies was hardly unheard of, making Grace happy that she herself was armed. Placing the coin, her only reminder of Nick Gunar, back into her pocket, Grace turned her attention to helping with the evacuation. Right now, things were merely bad. Thankfully, there was a break in the rain, but a large group of displaced people living in tents with little to no security and only a bunch of volunteers to help them was bad under any circumstances. At any second, they could go from bad to worse. Shannon Calderon was the physician in charge, and Grace had taken to aiding her as she worked to keep these people healthy and to deal with illness and injury. It was overwhelming. Grace was no doctor, but she knew basic first aid and there was always a need for volunteers, if only for another pair of hands. The past few days had been harrowing, but with the break in the rain, today was merely bad. Shannon, however, looked positively happy. \"Win the Powerball back in the states?\" Grace joked. \"I hear you can win a few hundred million.\" \"Something better,\" Shannon replied. \"Doctor Sam Radford.\" Grace looked around and nodded. \"Another doctor is always welcome, but what makes him so special?\" \"He's the top trauma surgeon in the United States,\" Shannon explained. \"Chief of staff at a prestigious hospital, and due to arrive here any minute.\" Grace made a whistling sound. \"How'd we rate such a bigshot?\" \"Sam's done work with our agency every year for quite a while.\" Shannon laughed. \"For a medical adrenaline junkie like him, this is heaven.\" \"So, you've worked with him before?\" Shannon shook her head. \"This will be a first. But I know of him. We're very lucky.\" As if on cue, a sand colored Toyota Land Cruiser pulled into the camp, and Shannon began walking toward it. The front passenger door opened, and a tall man stepped out carrying two duffle bags and wearing designer outdoor wear that probably cost more than most of these people made in a year. Must be nice , Grace thought. Sam Radford looked to be in his early fifties, and he wore his age well. She imagined he was a bit younger than old Nick Gunar. Grace absently wondered how the old Swede was doing. He had to be almost sixty by now. Was he still alive? Would she even recognize him? Grace shook her head. Nick Gunar was the smart one. He stayed with Loki back on the island, raising her son as his own and living in a tropical paradise. Nick had put his demons to rest and found his happily ever after. Grace was still hounded by hers, and happily ever after? Only when she watched Disney movies and romcoms. She turned her attention back to this American doctor. Sam Radford was fair skinned, blue eyed, and light haired, everything the locals were not. He was no soldier, that was for sure, but he carried himself like someone who had seen disaster areas and in spite of his obvious suburban wealth, he somehow did not look out of place. American doctor. Grace laughed at her thinking of him that way, as though he was American, and she was a local. Grace Lashield was as American as Doctor Radford. She had not set foot in the land of her birth in the more than two decades since working with Nick, and her Spanish was probably better than her English by this point, but she was an American; a nice white girl from a suburban neighborhood before she joined the military in the eighties. Enough memory lane , she thought. Doctor Radford was here, and seemed to be getting right to business, much to Shannon's delight. Grace went back to her tasks, most of which involved helping to load the many things that needed loading onto the trucks so that they could get these people away before things went from bad to worse as they inevitably would. The wind was blowing strong, and sky looked ominous. Grace knew the signs. She redoubled her efforts with the others to get the trucks loaded before returning to the medical tent to lend whatever hand she could. As the wind kicked up and the skies began to darken, Grace's thoughts turned again to Nick Gunar. What happened to you, you old Swede?[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 The rain and the wind came in hard, and it was all they could do to get people out in time. As he fixed the saline IV to his dehydrated patient using the Gray House medallion, he looked up and there, plain as day, was Cassie. She was wearing army fatigues and had a pistol at her side. She smiled at him approvingly. He blinked and shook his head – there was no way that Cassie was here in Colombia. When he looked again, she was gone. Sam was a rational man, a man of medical science, and prided himself on being a bit of a skeptic. But his fiancée often did things that defied logical explanation. The way she just knew things amazed him. Could Cassie actually project herself thousands of miles away just to reassure him? If anyone could, it was Cassie, but Sam was still inclined toward a more rational explanation. Cassie often befuddled him, but always in a good way. The care package she had given him was a perfect example; each and every item had proven to be perfect for very specific needs, almost as if she knew exactly what he would need before he even got to Colombia. How did she do it? At the same time, Cassie was often blinded to things that would affect her negatively, often obvious things, and would end up being blindsided. Ryan's near, though accidental betrayal had almost cost Cassie her shop, and according to Brandon, she had almost been swindled out of Gray House while she was married to Jake, who proved instrumental in saving it. It often seemed to come down to her believing that things would ultimately work out, and that people would rise above their baser nature and do what was right. He smiled and shook his head. Sam's fiancée was both an open book and an inscrutable mystery. She was the most amazing person he had ever met. The fact that she had fallen in love with him was yet another mystery, one that made him the happiest man alive. All because he had chosen to move to Middleton. The truck bounced and jostled everyone as it rode over rough terrain, but his patient's saline IV stayed in place. After using the Gray House medallion to hang the IV for the dehydrated woman, Sam Radford had officially lost everything Cassie gave him. Even the flashlight had escaped him. As the truck rolled away, he lamented the loss of her gifts, but did not regret it. Everything had been given away to help people with far less than either himself or Cassie, and he was certain she would understand. Only the Gray House medallion really bothered him, but there was nothing to be done – the IV would never hold without it, not on an eighty-mile journey to the new location. Once there, things should settle down and Sam would soon be on his way back to Middleton. Cassie had been so worried. He had never seen her like this before, and he wanted to get back to her as soon as possible. Thankfully, he had been able to do what he had come to do. Sam Radford had helped people. It was why he became a doctor in the first place. He leaned back and took a moment to rest. All he could think about was how Cassie had just appeared before the trucks rolled out. He would have to ask her about that when he got home. For now, he could relax and enjoy the bumpy ride. GW With the camp moved out of the floodplain, the people were safe. Doctor Radford had gone home, and the worst was over. Grace Lashield went to Doctor Calderon to see if there was anything else she could do. Before she walked into the tent, a teen girl tugged at her sleeve. Grace recalled that the girl's name was Maria. Doctor Radford had helped Maria's family, including setting up a saline IV for Maria's mother, Rosa. Before they left for this location, Grace had stopped at the truck and watched as Doctor Radford helped Rosa. She could not help but smile at the sight. Then the doctor noticed, and Grace had promptly gone back to loading the trucks. In Spanish, she asked, \"How's your mom doing?\" \"Much better, thanks to Doctor Radford,\" Maria replied, also in Spanish. \"I was hoping you could help with something, though. My mother wanted to return this medallion to him, but he's gone. Could you get it to Doctor Calderon? She might know where to send it.\" \"Sure thing, kid,\" Grace promised in English. \"See you round.\" \"Thank you,\" Maria replied, also in English. Grace laughed and then looked at the medallion as Maria walked away. It had a picture of what looked like an old Victorian era mansion. On the back, it said, \"Gray House.\" \"Oh, Grace, there you are.\" It was Doctor Calderon. \"I wanted to thank you for all your help. I wish we could compensate you better, but ….\" \"Keeping me fed while I was here is thanks enough,\" Grace remarked. \"More to life than money. I learned that lesson twenty-four years ago. Almost cost me my life. Say, what's a Gray House?\" \"Gray House?\" Calderon looked confused, and then she said, \"Ah. Gray House. It's the bed and breakfast Doctor Radford's fiancée operates back in Middleton.\" \"Middleton,\" Grace mused. \"Yeah; Sam says it was the place where he found peace and joy. To hear him talk, it's the happiest place on Earth.\" \"Happiest place on Earth ….\" Grace suddenly knew what she had to do. Sam Radford would get his medallion back. Grace Lashield had spent the last twenty-four years being anything but happy. Radford was a good man, good in a way that few people she had met were. In a weird way, he reminded her of Nick Gunar, though without the whole tormented soul thing. Nick Gunar had found happiness in the arms of Loki in the South China Sea. Perhaps Grace could find happiness in a small town in middle America, at a B&B; called Gray House.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Grace Russel sat at an outdoor table out front of the Bistro. Stephanie had just served her a sandwich and latte, and Grace thought it would be a great day to enjoy the outdoors while looking at options for college. She had wanted so badly to go to Haverhill, but after learning that her attendance would have meant taking a place away from her best friend, Courtney, Grace had given up the opportunity so that Courtney could attend. She had no regrets – Courtney was truly deserving, and Grace would do anything for her friends – but now, she had to figure out her own college plans. The aroma of coffee prompted her to lift the cup to her lips and drink. She smiled as she placed the cup back on the table. A perfect cup, as always. \"Grace!\" She turned to see Courtney half walking/half running towards her, an Asian man of short stature following her. Grace practically leapt from her chair to embrace Courtney. \"Courtney!\" \"Grace,\" Courtney replied, hugging her tightly. \"This is Kam Gunar, professor of Asian history at Haverhill. I know your mom travelled all over the world, so when I told him about Cassie, he really wanted to meet her.\" Grace nodded. Cassie. Everyone knew Cassie or knew of Cassie it seemed. She smiled, happy to be more anonymous than her mother. Still, Courtney also brought Professor Gunar – and this man certainly did not look like a Gunar – over to meet her. Grace nodded and smiled at the professor, extending her right hand. \"Grace Russel.\" He shook her hand firmly. \"Professor Gunar; but everyone calls me Kam.\" Professor Gunar reminded her a bit of an action actor in one of those chop-socky films Nick liked to watch – what was his name? Then she remembered: Tony Jaa. He was only about five and a half feet tall, with a very traditional short haircut. A pair of stylish glasses and his wearing dockers and a sport coat made him look more professorial than the action star he resembled. He had leading man looks, which made Grace slightly jealous of her friend. \"School hasn't even started yet. How did you meet Courtney?\" \"At the college tour,\" Kam explained. \"I just ran into her here by chance, but she insisted I meet you.\" Courtney nodded her head vigorously. \"This guy is so cool! He's from this island in the South China Sea, and he came to America with his father right at the turn of the century!\" Kam nodded. \"My adoptive father, actually; my birth father died when I was very young. I have no memories of him, but my mom remarried later, and when he brought me to America, he adopted me formally.\" \"That's so sweet,\" Grace exclaimed. \"Your mom must really love him!\" \"She did,\" Kam replied, his expression taking on a tone of grief. \"She was killed when I was twelve. That's why Nick brought me to the states.\" \"Oh ….\" Grace did not know what else to say. \"It's alright,\" Kam assured. \"We still miss her, but she's always with me.\" \"I … I'm glad you've been able to move on,\" Grace said as supportively as she could. \"My father was killed when I was eleven. My mom and I took a long time to come to terms with it. If it helps, I do know what you're going through.\" \"Thank you, Grace. Courtney said you're very kind. It's my father that concerns me, though.\" \"Oh?\" She remembered her mom's ordeal in the wake of Jake Russel's death, and could hardly imagine the grief that Kam's poor father must feel. Cassie was a remarkable woman whose insight seemed to guide her through even the darkest times. Grace doubted that Nick Gunar had that kind of insight.\" \"My dad blames himself,\" Kam explained. \"He's former spec-ops. He felt he should have seen it coming … but he didn't. I told him we all knew it was a possibility, but he still blames himself. I've been trying to get him to move to Middleton – the man deserves some happiness. I've finally gotten him to come visit me here, and I plan on making reservations for him at Gray House.\" \"I'll make sure my mom has a room for him,\" Grace assured. She wondered what \"it\" was that should have been seen, and that others on the island had known was a possibility, but she opted not to pry. \"Thank you, Grace,\" Kam replied. \"I keep telling him that he deserves happiness, and Middleton is the happiest place on Earth.\" \"Isn't that Disney World?\" Courtney asked. \"Nah,\" Kam replied with a laugh. \"That place is nice, but it's so … artificial.\" Grace beamed at this. Her instincts to stay local were just affirmed. Under the right circumstances, she might be enticed to attend college further away, but still, Middleton was her home, and Grace could not imagine being far from it for long. \"Middleton really is the happiest place on Earth,\" Grace assured. \"Says the girl who's never left,\" Courtney chided. Grace laughed. \"True, but still – Middleton is special, and Kam's dad will have not one, but two Merriwick women pulling for him.\" \"I appreciate this more than you can imagine,\" Kam said softly. \"My father has had a rough life, both before he met my mother, and after her death. I truly believe that the only time he's been happy in his life was his time with my mother and me on the island. I hope that he can make a new start here in Middleton.\" \"If he's looking for a place to start fresh,\" Grace assured, \"Middleton is it.\" Before Kam could reply, the air was split by a loud, \"Yoo-hoo!\" Martha Tinsdale marched over to them, with her usual purposeful stride, waving. \"Did I hear you saying that my Middleton is the happiest place on Earth?\" Martha joined them and gave Grace a warm smile. \"It warms my heart!\" \"But don't you now live in Blairsville?\" Courtney asked. \"Oh, pish-posh,\" Martha said dismissively. \"That's all because of some form of dastardly underhanded tomfoolery, and when I figure out a way to fix this, you can rest assured that Martha Tinsdale will be running for mayor once again!\" \"I look forward to that, Madam Mayor,\" Kam said. Martha beamed at this, while Grace and Courtney just giggled. \"Martha,\" Grace announced, \"this is Kam Gunar; professor of Asian History at Haverhill.\" \"My alma mater,\" Martha gushed. \"And thank you for addressing me by my once and future title!\" With the \"once and future\" comment, Grace wondered if Martha planned on pulling a sword from a stone. In her own way, Martha was as formidable a woman as Cassie, and if she said she would find a solution, Grace had no doubt that a solution would be found. Then, Abigail would have a run for her money in the next election. That thought truly made Grace smile.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Cassie set up a new crystal display on the table. She loved crystals and wished that people had a greater appreciation of their positive benefits. Sam certainly did not. Much as she loved Sam, appreciation of alternative and holistic medicine was something he lacked, though he had developed an appreciation for her ability to help others with her treatments, and no longer tried to disprove everything she suggested in that area. Perhaps that was their great strength: Sam and Cassie had very different beliefs in some areas that were fairly central to who they were as people. They did not believe the same, but they believed in each other and looked past the differences. As she placed the last crystal onto the display, she stood and smiled, saying, \"Hello Stephanie.\" Stephanie was unsettled, and her off balanced energy preceded her into the shop. Cassie turned to offer her friend a smile. Whatever it was, she was sure that she could settle Stephanie's jitters. \"Cassie!\" Stephanie shook her head and wrung her hands as she made her way into the Bell Book. \"Ryan is at it again!\" Cassie shot her friend a puzzled look. \"Ryan? What could he possibly be …?\" Stephanie pulled a piece of paper from her purse and placed it on the counter. \"Take a look and you'll see.\" Cassie went to the counter and picked up the paper. It looked like a screen shot that Stephanie had printed. \"Grand-Mart comes to Middleton.\" It took a moment for the words to sink. Then, her eyes widened. \"They plan to put this in the old Tybanks warehouse. That's ….\" \"That's the death knell for … almost every small business in Middleton!\" \"Death knell?\" Cassie wondered if perhaps Stephanie was just being overly dramatic. \"Cassie, they have a Java Shack, a Barnaby's, a Yankee Candle, and a Life-Books!\" Stephanie shook with rage. \"The first two will kill the bistro, and the last two will kill the Bell, Book & Candle.\" \"Life Books? I'm not familiar ….\" \"They're a new chain bookstore that focuses on self-help and self-improvement, as well as best sellers! Cassie, you're the only game in town with books. If they open that Grand-Mart, all your foot traffic will disappear!\" \"Surely, our customers ….\" \"Will not be loyal,\" Stephanie interjected. \"Every time big box stores open in small towns, all those supposedly \"loyal\" customers leave for cheap prices and one stop shopping. They'll put us under, Cassie.\" Then she added, \"They even have an in-house florist! They'll put Abigail out of business too.\" Unfortunately, Stephanie was right. Cassie had read all of the stories and statistics about big box stores coming to small towns. And a Grand-Mart … this really would be devastating to Middleton's local businesses. She felt completely blindsided … just like the last time Ryan got involved with Jones's real estate deals. \"But … why would Ryan do that?\" Cassie tried to put the pieces together. \"Ryan … loves Middleton. He agonized over the thought that I would lose my store, and he … he loves the Bistro.\" Stephanie shook her head in disbelief. \"I don't understand why he would do this to … something he loves.\" \"Maybe …\" Cassie realized as she spoke, \"maybe it's not him.\" Stephanie looked at Cassie with befuddlement. \"I don't understand.\" \"Well, Ryan ended up going back to work with Jones,\" Cassie explained. \"Jones has him working closely with his daughter, Frankie. The two of them have Ryan's ear twenty-four/seven.\" \"Yeah,\" Stephanie huffed. \"They say, 'jump,' he says, 'how high?' No wonder you dumped him for Sam.\" Cassie shot Stephanie a disapproving smile. \"It wasn't like that. Ryan … really pushed me … tried to get me to see things that weren't there. Ryan was in love with me … and he wanted me to feel the same. He wanted it so badly that he convinced himself that I did … but that I just couldn't see it.\" \"You don't think he's doing this to get back at you … do you?\" Cassie shook her head. \"I can't see that. I can't think that of him.\" Ryan was many things, but vindictive had never been one of them. The thought that Ryan could turn on her in such a way that others' livelihoods would be destroyed sent a chill through her. Ryan had been her rock through Jake's death. He had been the friend she needed. Cassie had told him time and again that she was not ready to date. Ryan never heard her. Was their friendship based entirely on Ryan's infatuation with her? Had it all been just an elaborate rebound for him? The answer did not matter. This had to be stopped, and the only person she could think of who could stop it … was Ryan.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Middleton. The images on the computer monitor looked so idyllic. Everyone looked happy. Nick Gunar stared at the smiling image of Mayor Abigail Pershing against the backdrop of the cozy little town. It was a tourism website for the town, so Nick expected everyone in the pictures to look happy, but his son assured him that Middleton was the real deal. His son. Gunar laughed. Kam was not really Nick Gunar's son. The young Haverhill professor's father was dead before Nick ever met the boy and his mother, Loki, on an island in the South China Sea in nineteen ninety-four. He had gone to the island with his handpicked team to do a job, never expecting to meet Loki and fall in love. In fact, Nick had been hired by a company called Nitro-Mine, and he and his team were paid to go to the island and either force the natives to sell to Nitro-Mine or drive them out if they refused. Nick had been personally recommended to the job by his old commanding officer, Colonel Merrick. Nick was down and out at the time, so he took the job. What did he have to lose? In the end, he lost everything. Lost? No, for the first time in his life, Nick had not lost everything; he sacrificed it for something better. As it turned out, Nitro-Mine intended to strip mine the island, utterly destroying it in the process – all for bat guano. It sounded insane, but apparently, they could extract nitro-methane from millions of years of built up bird droppings. People who had lived on the island for hundreds of years would be displaced. All for money. The love of a widowed native woman, Loki, and the encouragement of one of his team, Grace Lashield, helped him to acknowledge the truth that he already knew – it was time to fight for something greater than himself. Instead of driving out the locals, Nick turned on his employers and sided with the locals to help them keep their land. Half of his team sided with him. The rest joined the reinforcements that Nitro-Mine sent to finish the job. Nick, Grace, and Jamaal were all that remained of his team in the end, but they triumphed. The locals fought alongside them, and they won. After years as a mercenary and a soldier, always looking for, but never finding peace, Nick Gunar had at last found the tranquility that had long eluded him. He stayed with Loki and her five-year-old son, Kamnan, marrying her according to the local customs and raising the boy as his own. It was paradise. Nick Gunar and Loki had found their happily ever after. He should have known better. Happily ever after only existed on the Hallmark Channel. Seven years later, Nitro-Mine returned. The remnants of the company had been bought by an unscrupulous investment group and this time, there was no pretense of attempting to buy the land. They sent in a much larger force to take the island, and without the aid of his team or any kind of meaningful arsenal, Nick Gunar and the locals were forced to retreat and seek egress from the island. Loki was killed during the fighting and Nick barely escaped with Kamnan and some of the other locals. A widowed single dad, Nick Gunar returned to Chicago – the very place he was living down and out when Colonel Merrick recruited him. This time, he had a son to raise. Gunar still had a few remaining connections, and he was able to legally adopt the boy and get him U.S. citizenship. Nick did local security and bodyguard work and put Kamnan through school. The boy proved to be brilliant, and excelled, ultimately being accepted at a small but prominent college, Haverhill. The college was near Middleton, but apart from touring the school with Kamnan, Nick did not take in the local sights. He returned to Chicago. With Kam off at school, Nick poured himself into his work to pay the young man's expenses, even doing some K&R; (kidnap and rescue). Kamnan now had a doctorate in Asian history and had returned to Haverhill to become a professor. With the work of raising the boy done, what was there for him to do? His son still needed him – that would not change – but he no longer needed Nick as a parent to take care of him. Kamnan needed a supportive parent who could serve more as a mentor … but Nick had no idea how to be a professional mentor to his adult son. Kamnan was a college professor now, while Nick was … what Nick Gunar had always been: a man of war. Nick was tired of fighting. He was tired of being the soldier. He was sixty-one, and the life of a bodyguard and K&R; work were vocations for the young. Nick was not even young at heart. For seven blissful years, he was able to leave that life behind. Then Loki's death pulled him right back into it – it was the only life he knew, but it was a life he could no longer live. Middleton. Kam wanted so badly for his father to live there. There was a reservation at a B&B; called Grey House waiting for him, courtesy of Kam. He resolved to go – it would make his son happy – but what then? If he was going to make a life in Middleton, he would need to find work. But what kind of work would Middleton have for a man of war? He idly clicked on the \"Jobs in Middleton\" link, and to his surprise, the small town's police department had an opening. It seemed that the department was bidding farewell to Officer Jan Thompkins, wishing her well in her move to the Chicago PD. \"Barney Fief could do this job,\" Nick said with a chuckle. In spite of his age, he was still in fantastic shape. Nick looked at the photo of Chief Derek Sanders and Lieutenant Brandon Russell. The chief looked like he belonged in a police comedy, and Brandon looked like he was barely out of high school … or maybe Nick was just old; he could no longer tell. Nick Gunar was probably more durable and able to handle himself than anyone on the small town's force. \"Why not?\" He filled out the online application, attached his resume, and hit the send button. If the department was willing to give him a shot, he thought maybe, just maybe, he could make a life in the idyllic little town with the smiling mayor.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Doctor Sam Radford walked to the lobby with his last patient, the one and only Martha Tinsdale. Martha was on about … something. Sam had tuned her out a while ago. When Martha was on a mission, she was single-minded and forceful. When she was not, the former mayor was a font of useless gossip and rambling declarations that carried little or no meaning to anyone but her. \"I'm sure it will all work out, Martha,\" he assured. \"Doctor Radford, have you even been listening to me?\" Martha glared at him indignantly. \"Oh, yes, Martha – how could I not?\" \"Oh,\" she sighed, \"I don't see how it possibly could. Now that I live in … Blairsville ….\" She practically spat the name of Middleton's rival town. \"You'll find an answer, Martha,\" Sam assured. \"You always do.\" She smiled. \"I do, don't I?\" \"Every time.\" \"Oh, thank you, Doctor Radford! You're so supportive – no wonder Cassie is so taken with you. Well, I must carry on. Ta-ta!\" \"Just be careful, Martha – that knee of yours is still a bit tender. \"Of course, of course,\" she replied. Before she could say more, however, the front door to Sam's lobby opened. Cassie stood in the door, and a look of anxiety cast a shadow over the woman's beautiful visage. \"Sam ….\" It was all she said. It was all she needed to say. Sam went to her and took her in his arms. \"Cassie, what's wrong?\" \"Oh, Sam … I just learned from Stephanie that a Grand-Mart is coming to Middleton,\" Cassie explained. \"It kind of came out of nowhere. I tried calling Ryan – he's the one spearheading it – but I can't get through. It just goes straight to voicemail. It may not seem like much, but I have a terrible feeling about this.\" \"A Grand-Mart?\" Martha half asked, half exclaimed. \"Why, that would put half the local businesses in Middleton out of business!\" \"I'm sure Abigail can keep this from happening,\" Sam assured. \"She is the mayor after all, and she's a shopkeeper too.\" \"Indeed,\" Martha interjected. \"Abigail needs to put the kybosh on this! Toot sweet!\" \"That's just it, Martha,\" Cassie sighed in frustration. \"Abigail is firmly against it, but Jones has spent the past year wooing the town council. It seems that money talks and keeps them from talking – they're practically ready to let this happen, and they've gone to great lengths to keep his plans from Middleton's business leaders and from Abigail. We're both Merriwick's Sam … and we were both blindsided.\" \"Why would Ryan do this?\" Sam shook his head. \"Didn't he fight Jones on doing this exact same thing a couple years back?\" \"I'm afraid we don't really know Ryan anymore, Sam. I have some connections.\" Then she smiled. \"And I'm sure that with the help of two former mayors, Abigail can put a stop to this.\" \"Oh, Cassie,\" Martha said with a smile, pleased to be included. Sam smiled approvingly. Martha was a strong woman, one of the strongest he knew … and Cassie had just given her a mission. \"Well between the two of you, they don't stand a chance,\" Sam assured. \"I'll do some digging too and see what I can options I can turn up.\" \"Thank you, Sam,\" Cassie said, hugging him once more and kissing him. \"Anything will help.\" \"In the meantime,\" Martha declared, \"I will contact the local business owners and we will gather to strategize!\" As she began to walk out the door, she called back, \"Come, Cassie! We have work to do!\" \"You'd better go with her, Cassie,\" Sam said with a resigned grin. \"Martha's on a mission.\" \"Yes, but she'll need more than just determination.\" She kissed him again. \"Thank you, Sam.\" \"For what?\" \"I knew that if I came here, I would know what to do next – and now I do.\" Cassie smiled that beautiful smile that lit up Sam's world. \"Good bye, Sam. I love you.\" He kissed her and said, \"I love you too, Cassie. I'll see you at dinner?\" \"Yes. I also have two guests due in late this afternoon – one of them is the father of a Haverhill Professor.\" \"I'll look forward to it. In the meantime, I'll see what I can dig up about this Grand-Mart.\" \"Thank you, Sam!\" With that, Cassie walked out the door. Sam allowed his gaze to linger on his fiancée's graceful figure as she left. Once Cassie was gone, however, his smile turned to a frown and his brow furrowed. Eve walked over and joined him as the door closed behind Cassie. \"They have a clinic in there too,\" the receptionist noted. \"And an eyeglass store,\" Sam added. \"I probably won't be affected – my regulars would likely stay loyal. Even if they didn't, being the chief of staff at the hospital, I'm not in such a precarious position. Doctor Sterling down the street, though, she won't be able to compete with Grand-Mart on prices for glasses. They'll put her under.\" \"If your practice can't stay open, Doctor Radford, what will I do?\" \"My recommendation will net you a job anywhere. Heck, I could probably find you a position at the hospital. But not everyone is so fortunate. We need to get this resolved. I'm just not sure if Abigail will be able to stop it, even with Cassie and Martha's help.\" Sam looked out at the town. He could see the Bistro and Abigail's Flower Market from his front door. The Bell Book & Candle was not in his field of vision, but he thought about Cassie's shop. Then there were the various little boutiques, a toy store, greengrocer, sporting goods, and other specialty shops whose services would all be mimicked in the Grand-Mart. Sam was a man who never let go of a problem. Cassie would do her part, and whatever part that was, it would be crucial. But for Sam, Middleton had just become his patient, and there was no way he would let this patient die on the table.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Brandon brought the squad car to a stop in front of Harvey's Hardware store, its siren making one final authoritative blare as he shut off the car. He and Officer Jan Thompkins practically leapt from the cruiser, guns drawn. They were responding to a two-eleven in progress, the fourth this month. They went in with caution, though by the time they got there, Brandon suspected that the robbers were gone. Still, his father died responding to a two-eleven in progress very similar to this one. \"Police,\" Brandon called, careful to stand away from the glass front door. \"They're gone,\" Harvey called from inside. Brandon and Jan went inside and found Harvey half sitting, half lying on the floor, leaning against his counter. The left side of his face was swollen, the eye already beginning to darken. The hardware store owner had always presented himself as a rough and tumble DIY guy, always wearing flannels and sporting a thick beard. The man lying on the floor was but a shell of the man Brandon knew. Harvey just cried as he lay on the floor of his shop. There was no pretense of masculine toughness – just a middle aged, slightly overweight man no taller than Brandon laying on the floor, beaten down by an armed assailant. The two officers knelt to aid the sobbing Harvey. \"He pistol-whipped me,\" the shopkeeper cried. \"I let them take all the money, and the big one … he just kept hitting me ….\" \"Did you see what they looked like?\" Jan asked. Harvey shook his head. \"They wore ski masks.\" \"Were they both armed?\" Brandon asked. Harvey nodded at this but said nothing. \"Was one about five eight and the other about six feet?\" Jan asked. Harvey nodded again as they helped him to his feet. \"We'll call you an ambulance ….\" Brandon began but Harvey cut him off. \"No – I want to go to Doctor Radford.\" \"Sure, Harvey\" Jan said. \"Don't worry, Harvey,\" Brandon assured, \"we'll find them.\" \"Just … just keep them away from me.\" Brandon and Jan nodded. There was nothing more for them to say. They stepped outside, to discuss the crime. \"Same two guys,\" Brandon declared. \"Gotta be. Same M.O, same description.\" \"Quick smash and grab,\" Jan agreed. \"And beat up anyone who gets in their way.\" \"We're lucky they haven't shot anyone yet,\" Brandon noted. \"Clearly, they're violent – and It's not just the larger one who beats on people either.\" \"Fourth two-eleven this month,\" Jan noted. \"By Middleton standards ….\" \"It's a crimewave,\" Brandon finished. \"Lucky me,\" Jan observed sarcastically. \"I'm finally leaving for the Chicago PD, and we start having gunplay in Middleton.\" \"We need to catch theses guys before someone gets seriously hurt.\" Brandon looked in through the front door at Harvey. The poor guy looked like he was about to collapse to the floor again, curl up in a fetal position, and just cry. GW Derek sat at an outdoor table at the Bistro nursing a cup of coffee. They thought the three robberies earlier in the month had been the work of two perpetrators who were just passing through and that the storm had passed. Clearly, this was not the case. On top of that, he was about to lose a good officer to the Chicago PD and her replacement was likely to be a young rookie. People with experience tended to go to larger towns where the pay was better. He had his tablet on the table next to his coffee and reviewed the resume he had just received over the internet. Nick Gunnar. Unlike the batch of resumes from young hopefuls, this man had experience – lots of experience – maybe too much experience. He read through what looked to be over forty years of experience. While none of it was law enforcement, it was all relevant experience; special forces, mercenary work, K&R;, security, and body guard duty. The Swedish born Gunnar had come to the United States in his teens, joined the Army and became a Green Beret. After that, had actually fought in Angola as a mercenary – all in the nineteen seventies! It took Derek a few moments using Google to even figure out that Angola was located in Africa. After that was a long list of mercenary work, time in the French Foreign Legion, and a return to the United States Army later in the eighties. He fought in Desert Shield and Desert Storm, got out in nineteen ninety-two, and then returned to Mercenary work in nineteen ninety-four. Brandon was not even alive in nineteen ninety-four! Derek scratched his head, idly wondering if resumes longer than six pages were the norm back then. What would he do with this guy? Why was this guy even applying? He had to be pushing sixty. Admittedly, Middleton was an easy enough town that Gunnar's age would probably not prevent him from doing the job, but it seemed odd that this man of war would even be interested in Middleton, much less wanting to join its police force. \"Looking at Nick Gunnar's resume?\" Grace Russell peered over the tablet at Derek, her winsome smile and knowledge of this old mercenary catching him off guard. \"How do you know about him, Grace?\" \"He's Professor Kam Gunnar's dad,\" the Merriwick girl explained. \"Kam's a professor at Haverhill, and he wants his dad to move here from Chicago. I told him I'd do whatever I could to help.\" If Grace was here to \"help,\" that meant that Cassie probably sent her, If Cassie had sent Grace as he assumed, then Derek knew better than to say no. Middleton's resident enchantress was rarely mistaken about anything, and her judge of character was the best Derek had ever seen. Cassie had uncanny insight, and if she was in favor of hiring Nick Gunnar, then who was Derek to say no? \"Okay,\" he declared as he set down his tablet and smiled. \"I'll ask him to come in for an interview.\" Grace gasped in surprise. \"Oh, thank you!\" Derek grinned and gave her a thumbs-up. \"Kam will be so happy!\" Grace sauntered off, leaving Derek feeling happy about how things ended up … though he could not quite figure out why.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Cassie sat with Sam on the love seat in the living room of Grey House, waiting for her guests to arrive. He had just finished telling her about treating Harvey, the owner of the hardware store, for minor injuries after the store was robbed. Brandon and Jan had been the responding officers. Apparently, the perpetrators pummeled Harvey into submission before robbing the place, and then pistol whipped him and pummeled him some more. Harvey had refused the ambulance ride in favor being treated by Sam. Cassie shook her head. \"Sam, this … this is terrible! That poor man ….\" \"And he's not the only one,\" Sam noted. \"The same two men have hit three other shops in Middleton this month, treating the clerks the same as they treated Harvey. I feel like I should just have icepacks and aspirin in the waiting room.\" \"Sam … how come I'm just hearing about this?\" \"Well, we have been busy with wedding preparations, and you were visiting Olympia in Chicago at the beginning of the month. A lot can happen during a week away, and the first three robberies happened while you were gone.\" \"But I talked to Brandon on the phone while I was away.\" \"Cassie, if you're out of town, do you really think he's going to tell you that there's armed gunmen going on a crime spree in Middleton?\" Then she felt the color drain from her face. \"Sam, if he had gotten to the hardware store just a few minutes earlier, he could have been shot at … or … shot!\" \"But he wasn't,\" Sam reminded her. \"I'm going to give you some of your own advice; don't worry yourself over what might have happened if.\" She nodded. Normally, she would not worry over the 'could haves,' but Jake died in the line of duty doing much the same thing that Brandon was doing now. \"Well, I saw Brandon earlier this week. I'd think he'd have said something ….\" \"Cassie, Brandon doesn't want you to worry.\" Sam squeezed her hand. \"Nothing had happened for almost two weeks. He probably would have mentioned it, but after a week of quiet, they probably thought it was over. Besides, weren't you two talking about his relationship with Tara?\" \"I know, Sam, but ….\" Cassie felt her heartrate rising and struggled to calm herself. She was certain that had it been anyone else in the room, they would not have realized how upset she was … but it was Sam, and he instantly knew that she was practically beside herself. He pulled her close and enfolded her in his arms, and she began to calm. It was the same with Jake. She paused in her thoughts to be thankful to have once-in-a-lifetime twice in Jake and Sam. \"What will we do, Sam? Should I maybe close the shop earlier? And Tara ….\" \"They're hitting during the day, likely taking advantage of the small police force in Middleton – nobody right on hand to chase them. Maybe I should check in and visit you a little more frequently?\" She purred at that thought. Suddenly, a strong feeling of positivity washed over her. This would all be alright. Brandon would be safe, and there would be no more shopkeepers and clerks beaten at the hands of these robbers. \"I'm always happy to see you at the Bell Book, Sam. Just as long as it doesn't take you away from your patients.\" \"Cassie, you're my priority. You, Nick and Grace come first; we are going to be a family, and that begins now, not after we're married. Besides, you know I enjoy going to see you at the Bell Book as much as you love me to visit.\" \"Then it's settled,\" she said, flashing him a smile. \"I'll make sure to have some extra special treats waiting for you when you get there.\" \"You mean besides your eyes and smile?\" Cassie responded with a passionate kiss. It was one of those perfect moments that she loved with Sam, a moment in which she felt completely loved. Cassie wanted that moment to last forever. But it was interrupted by the doorbell. Cassie leaned back, smiled, and said, \"Grace.\" \"Grace … but she's not even in the house yet,\" Sam protested. \"How could you possibly ….\" \"Not that Grace,\" Cassie said as she stood and went to the door. \"One of my afternoon guests I was telling you about.\" George was making his way down the stairs to help with the guest's luggage. He reached the foyer as Cassie reached the door. She opened the door, a broad smile upon her face. \"Welcome to Grey … House ….\" \"Cassie,\" George exclaimed, \"there's … two of you!\" \"Apparently so,\" replied the guest. Upon hearing Cassie's voice trail off and George's expression of shock, Sam stood from his seat and went to join his fiancée at the front door. As soon as he made it to Cassie's side, he understood the confusion. Standing in the doorway wearing black fatigues and carrying a rucksack was a tall woman with long dark hair pulled into a ponytail. Atop her head was a black military style cap, and Sam was certain that the woman was armed. But it was not her garb or her gear that had so captured George and Cassie's attention. No, it was the woman herself. Every curve of her face and body was familiar to Sam. The woman's eyes, the curve of her lips, and even the bemused but puzzled facial expression were all familiar. She looked exactly like Cassie. \"Ah, Doctor Sam Radford,\" the woman said with a smile, her voice rough and gravely, but still similar to Cassie's. She reached into her pocket and pulled out the Grey House medallion Cassie had given him over the summer – the medallion that he had needed to use for Rosa's saline IV. \"I believe this belongs to you.\" Suddenly, he made the connection. \"You were in Colombia working with the evacuation efforts! I knew I wasn't hallucinating.\" He took the medallion and held it lovingly. \"I thought I'd lost this.\" \"You said you'd used it for a woman's I.V,\" Cassie said, still puzzled. \"He did,\" the woman said. \"Her daughter, Maria, asked me to see it returned to the doctor who helped her family so much. Whatever I was expecting when I came to Grey House, an identical twin was not it.\" \"The resemblance is uncanny,\" Sam noted. \"Downright spooky,\" George corrected. \"I think it's amazing,\" Cassie said with a smile. Now that the initial shock had worn off, she seemed to have regained her composure. \"And you were there, watching over my Sam.\" \"Grace Lashield,\" the woman said, extending her right hand. Cassie took Grace Lashield's hand and shook it. \"Cassie Nightingale.\" \"And your fiancé was watching over us, not the other way around,\" Grace corrected. \"Never seen anyone so dedicated or so caring. You've got a good man, Cassie Nightingale.\" \"Well, Grace Lashield, won't you come in?\" Cassie stepped back as a woman who looked like she just stepped out of an action movie walked through the front door of Grey House. George offered to take her bag, but Grace Lashield smiled and shook her head. \"Might be a bit heavy for you, old man.\" Sam chuckled while George grimaced. Cassie could hardly believe what she was seeing. This woman was like an identical twin, but her energy was different from anyone Cassie had ever met. She idly wondered if Grace Lashield might also be a Merriwick. Cassie had a lot of old paperwork, journals, and stuff in the attic and basement of Grey House and had done a fair amount of research herself. What would she learn about Grace Lashield? Was she indeed a Merriwick? Or did she just have an uncanny resemblance to Cassie Nightingale?[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Nick was on his way to Grey House, walking with a spring in his step. He was on his way back from the Botanical gardens where he had spent the afternoon with Katie and looked forward to the pastries and treats that he knew Cassie would have on hand. Besides, his father would probably be there, so he could put in the obligatory appearance, say hello to his future step-mom, and check in with his dad. \"Hey, Nick.\" It was Grace, who hurriedly joined him in his walk home. \"You look happy.\" \"Any reason why I wouldn't be?\" Grace giggled. \"None that I can think of. How did Katie like the Botanical Gardens?\" \"She loved it,\" Nick replied. \"We were checking out the Middleton Merriwick when – hey, wait a minute! How did you know?\" Grace flashed him a very Cassie-like grin, and for a moment, Nick thought she was going to say that she had a feeling. Instead, Grace pulled her phone from her purse and gave him a response that was more Sam Radford than Cassie Nightingale. \"Easy; Katie and I are friends on Facebook.\" Holding up her phone, Grace continued. \"She checked in at the Botanical Gardens with Nick Radford. It came up in my feed.\" Nick offered Grace a subdued smile. \"Yeah, I was with her at the Gardens.\" \"So, was the Merriwick in bloom?\" \"No – isn't that more of a spring thing?\" \"I suppose,\" Grace replied, now sounding more like Cassie. \"But with a Merriwick in Middleton, you never know.\" Nick chuckled at Grace's 'Merriwick' logic. Unlike his father, Nick was not the eternal skeptic. Cassie had a magic about her. There was no other way for him to describe it. She was like a Jedi, but without the martial arts, lightsabers, and celibacy vows. Grace had it too, though she was not quite so gifted as Cassie. Certainly, Cassie's magic had changed his father. It had also helped his mother to see things clearly and helped Nick to see things clearly on many occasions as well. \"I wish I'd treated you better when we first met.\" Grace looked at him with befuddlement. \"Not that I disagree – I wish you had too – but where is this coming from all of the sudden?\" He shrugged and offered her a sheepish smile. \"Just thought it was time to say it, that's all. I mean, you're going to be my sister and all ….\" Grace nodded, pondering his words momentarily as they walked. She had a particular expression when she was pondering. So too did Cassie. It was the same expression. Then she smiled. Grace's smile was different from Cassie's. It made Nick wish he had met Jake Russell so he could see how much of the late police chief was in Grace. It was easy to see Grace as Cassie's mini-me, but that would ignore the girl's uniqueness. There were things about Grace that were nothing like her mother, things that made her distinctly Grace. One of those things was that Grace was a bit of a detective. She had a tenacity that reminded him of his father. When Grace got a hold of a mystery, like the puzzle of Martha Tinsdale's ancestor Douglas Endicott, she did not let go until she had an answer. It reminded him so much of his father. \"Grace, do you think your dad was what my dad would have been like if he'd been a cop?\" \"That's a weird question.\" Grace put on her pondering face again. \"In some ways … but their personalities were really different. My dad was … quiet, reserved. He was more introspective I think than Sam. Your dad … he's a man of action. The one common trait I see is that they care very deeply about other people. My dad was more contemplative, while yours is very out in the open. That, and they both grab hold of problems and won't let go until they figure it out. Sam may not be a cop, but I think if he was, he'd be a good one.\" \"You kind of remind me of my dad,\" Nick noted. Then he quickly added, \"In all the good ways.\" \"Yeah,\" Grace agreed. \"I don't do the dad-jokes.\" Then she looked at Nick for a moment and said, \"Actually, you remind me a bit of my dad.\" \"Really?\" Nick found that hard to believe. \"Yeah. He was very introspective like you, kind of quiet. He didn't have that moody broody thing that you do …\" Nick laughed at that observation. \"But he had a quiet intensity like you. I think that's what attracted Katie to you.\" \"That, and lots of man-hours spent decorating for the dance,\" Nick reminded her. Grace giggled, nodding. \"Yes, that did make a huge difference.\" By now, they were walking up the steps to the front door or Grey House. Nick opened the door for Grace, but suddenly, she stopped and stood, a look similar to her pondering expression, but this look was different. She was puzzled, confused. \"Grace? You okay?\" \"Yeah … just … something's not right. Not bad … but not right. Come on; we need to get to the bottom of this.\" Grace hurried inside, Nick following. He hoped that Grace was not about to experience some gut-wrenching heartbreak or major life complication. He still had trouble interpreting Grace's gift and was glad to be along with her for this. They hurried into the kitchen, expecting to find Cassie in the early stages of preparing the evening meal, Nick's dad either helping her or just keeping her company. What they saw instead made them both stop and do a double-take. \"Mom?\" Grace's jaw dropped and her eyes were as wide as saucers. \"Cassie?\" Nick had more of a bemused grin. This was different. Really different. Standing in the kitchen was the form and figure of Cassie Nightingale, cracking open a can of Miller Genuine Draft – but it was Cassie as Nick – and apparently Grace – had never seen her before. \"I was just getting ready to kick back in the … whatever you call it with all the books.\" Cassie wore not one of her usual flowing dresses or casual outfits, but black paramilitary gear with a pistol nestled in a holster at her right hip. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail and her voice sounded gruff. \"Mom! That's … that's a gun!\" \"Looking rugged, Cassie,\" Nick said approvingly. \"Never thought you could pull off the action hero look, but you really rock it.\" \"Thanks, kid,\" Cassie replied. \"Mom!\" Grace shook her head vigorously. \"Have you taken leave of your senses? You're walking around Grey House armed!\" Cassie took a deep swig from the beer can and set it on the table. \"Open carry state, kid. And I'm not your mom.\" \"See?\" Nick looked at Grace reassuringly. \"Not your mom.\" He was starting to wonder of maybe Cassie had banged her head and developed a second personality. \"I think your mom's out back with Doctor Radford,\" not-Cassie explained. \"The name's Grace; Grace Lashield. And you must be Grace Russell and Nick Radford.\" \"Oh, hi, Grace! I didn't see you come in.\" This time, it was Cassie – the real Cassie. \"Hey, Nick. This is Grace Lashield. She worked with your dad down in Colombia back in the spring.\" Cassie began busying herself in the kitchen as Sam came into the room. \"Hey, Nick. Cassie has a mission for me. Want to come along?\" \"I'm out of potatoes and some other ingredients.\" Cassie kissed Sam's cheek. \"Your dad has kindly volunteered to go get it for me.\" Cassie and Sam looked radiantly happy together. Nick could not help but be happy for them. But they were not getting rid of Nick Radford that easily. This was way too interesting for him to duck out now. \"But … you might need my help in the kitchen,\" Nick offered. Cassie grinned, walked to the counter, and picked up a basket that resided by the stove. \"But I packed these for you to take with you.\" She handed Nick the basket which was filled with cupcakes – chocolate with chocolate frosting – brownies, and other baked treats. Score! Nick nodded while offering Cassie a satisfied grin. \"Thanks, Cassie. I'll make sure dad doesn't get lost on the way.\" \"Fat chance of that,\" Sam said as he put on his sport jacket. \"Apple Car-Play. Come on, Nick.\" \"See you, Cassie,\" Nick called as he left with his father.\" Cassie waved good bye, but before he was out the door, Nick called back. \"Hey, Grace – the tall expendables looking Grace – if you like beer, you should check out the microbrew. We know the owner – top shelf.\" Cassie's paramilitary doppelganger offered a crooked smile and a nod. \"Thanks, Nick. I just might do that.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 Tara was about to go for a dinner break when a car pulled up in front of the Bell Book, screeching to a stop. Two men in ski masks, guns drawn jumped out. It was the Middleton Bandits as they had come to be called. Her life flashed before her eyes as the gunmen approached. She locked the door and was backing up when she heard the siren. It was Brandon. She could see his squad car pull up abruptly, boxing in the robbers' car, a white Subaru Forrester. Brandon opened the driver's door of the squad car and took partial cover behind it, pointing his service pistol at them, shouting, \"Police! Freeze!\" His partner, Officer Jill Thompkins, took cover behind the squad car's right front fender, pointing her weapon at the two robbers. The Middleton Bandits immediately began firing, prompting Brandon and Jill to duck down as they attempted to return fire. Tara shrieked as she watched helplessly while her husband was being fired upon. Brandon had never faced any criminals like this during his brief career as a police officer. Even Jake's killer had not been the kind of threat posed by these two men. The robbers continued firing, moving out into the street. As a passing car approached, one of them stepped into the street and pointed his gun at the windshield. The car stopped, and the smaller one went to the driver's door as his partner in crime gave him cover fire, keeping Brandon and Jill pinned down. The smaller man pulled the driver, a middle-aged man, out from behind the wheel and tossed him roughly to the ground. Commandeering the car, the robber drove it forward and allowed his partner to get in on the passenger side. As they sped off, Brandon and Jill fired at the stolen car – a black Mercedes. The larger robber returned fire from the getaway car's passenger side window, striking Jill in the upper left chest, blood spraying as the bullet exited her back. The stricken officer cried out as she fell to the ground. \"Shots fired! Officer down! Officer down!\" Brandon's shouts into his radio were loud enough that Tara could hear him clearly from inside the Bell Book. \"Requesting an ambulance!\" The black Mercedes sped off leaving a possibly dead Officer Thompkins and a carjacking victim in the street. \"I'm still here,\" Jill's voice cried faintly from the other side of the police cruiser. Tara breathed a deep sigh of relief, and then went outside. \"Brandon!\" \"Tara, stay inside!\" Brandon allowed her to quickly embrace him before sending her back into the building. She did as her husband directed but continued to watch from the front window. Then, she saw the carjacking victim stand up looking dazed and confused, as Brandon went to Jill's side. The man was none other than Cassie's old friend, Ryan Elliot. GW As his father drove. Nick was absorbed texting with Katie. Suddenly, he heard two loud popping sounds. It sounded like gunfire. \"Dad, did you hear that?\" His father nodded as he drove, taking a left turn. \"Sounded like gunfire.\" Suddenly, Sam had to swerve sharply as a black Mercedes flew past them, partially on their side of the road. Nick was fixated on the drivers of the black car, and for a brief fraction of a second, he and the driver made eye contact. The driver and his passenger wore ski masks. It was the Middleton Bandits. Nick felt the Jeep speed up as his father depressed the accelerator sharply. \"Dad?\" \"Shots were fired,\" Sam noted. \"We'll be there before an ambulance.\" Nick just nodded as Sam sped to the scene. It did not take long to find – Brandon knelt on the ground next to a down officer – Jill Thompkins if he recalled – and Ryan Elliot stood by, looking like he wanted to help, but having no idea what to do. Sam Radford parked the car and jumped out, Nick racing to keep up. \"Nick, go into the Bell Book and check on Tara while I take care of Officer Thompkins!\" Nick nodded and did at his father bid. Then Tara burst forth from the Bell Book and ran to Brandon's side. \"Doctor Radford,\" Brandon called. \"Thank God you're here!\" Nick stood with Tara and Ryan and watched as Sam got to work. Clearly, Doctor Sam Radford knew what to do – Nick would have been surprised if his father did not, but Nick had rarely seen his father in action outside of a hospital setting, and then it was usually treating sick patients or people with injuries from falls or sports accidents. A gunshot wound was totally out of Nick's experience, but given that Sam Radford was a trauma surgeon, he imagined that his father had treated shooting victims more than a few times. \"Chest wound,\" Doctor Radford declared. \"Missed the heart … looks like it missed her lung … but it went clean through and she's bleeding badly. Nasty exit wound too. I'm more concerned with the bone fragments from the bullet's passage, which may have caused more internal damage.\" \"I … I feel faint,\" Jill said groggily. \"Am I gonna ….\" \"Make it?\" Sam smiled and nodded. \"You have my word.\" Nick watched as his father directed Brandon and made use of what he had on hand, which was not much, to keep the woman alive until the ambulance arrived. His father was so cool under pressure. It was like Sam Radford found his Zen in treating gravely wounded patients. For the first time, Nick regarded his father's profession with amazement. The ambulance pulled up, along with another squad car. Chief Derek Sanders jumped out and ran to Brandon and Jill. \"Brandon!\" Derek appraised the situation as the EMTs came over to take charge of Jill. \"She'll be alright,\" Sam assured. \"Nick, I need you to take care of Cassie's shopping list. I'll ride with Officer Thompkins. I'll call ahead to the hospital and get an O.R. prepped.\" He then tossed the keys to his Jeep to his son. \"Sure thing, Dad,\" Nick assured as he caught the keys. Brandon stood, but he shook. All the color had drained from him, and he looked like he might faint. \"Brandon?\" Tara went to him. \"You okay?\" \"I've never been in a gunfight,\" the young officer confessed. \"I … I've never even had to fire my gun except at the range. I've never been so scared in my life.\" \"Cassie's gonna freak when she hears about this,\" Derek exclaimed, his eyes wide. \"Not just Cassie,\" Tara reminded him. \"Grace and Lori ….\" \"Yeah,\" Brandon said as Sam left with Jill and the Paramedics. \"Grace is really gonna freak.\" \"Well, we have their car,\" Derek noted. \"Once we run tags ….\" \"I'm betting that's Hattie Berman's car,\" Brandon said. \"It was reported stolen yesterday. Same make and model, and I bet that once you run the tags, it'll come up as hers.\" \"That's one crime solved.\" Derek said with satisfaction.\" \"What about my car?\" Ryan finally spoke up. \"We'll do what we can,\" Derek assured. \"I've got an APB out on them. They won't get far.\" \"That's the problem,\" Brandon interjected. \"They don't seem interested in getting far. They're staying around here because we're easy pickings. And we weren't expecting to lose Jill for another two weeks. Now, by the time she's recovered, she'll be off to Chicago, and we still don't have a replacement.\" \"Actually, I'm interviewing someone tomorrow,\" Derek revealed. \"He's a piece of work, but he might be just what we need.\" Brandon suddenly remembered. \"Derek, is this that old guy with the twenty-page resume?\" \"Ten,\" Derek corrected. \"And yes, it is. But Grace says she has a feeling about him, so ….\" \"You know Grace isn't Cassie,\" Ryan reminded him. \"Yeah, but Grace has good instincts about people,\" Nick interjected. \"If Grace has a good feeling about him, I'd listen.\" Brandon nodded, but Ryan made a scoffing sound. Derek then looked at the realtor and folded his arms across his chest. \"What was that Ryan?\" \"Well,\" the realtor said, shifting nervously now that all eyes were upon him. \"Grace is just a kid. Sometimes ….\" \"Sometimes that kid has great instincts,\" Tara finished. \"Just like her mother.\" \"Coming from the guy that's about to cost half of Middleton's small businesses their livelihood,\" Derek said sardonically, \"I think I'll put my faith in Grace's instincts instead of your dismissals.\" Ryan opened his mouth, but Brandon held up his hand. \"Stop, Ryan. Just stop! I'm glad you're okay, and we'll do all we can to get your car back, but don't come around here shooting your mouth off like you're one of us; you're not!\" \"I grew up here,\" the realtor protested. \"Yeah, then you went off to work with Jones,\" Nick noted. \"And now, you're helping him put in a Grand Mart.\" \"Grand Marts are hugely popular,\" Ryan insisted. \"Everyone will love it!\" \"Not everyone,\" Nick corrected. \"The people whose shops go under probably won't be happy. But hey, I'm just some kid from New York, so ...\" he shrugged flashing his crooked smile, \"what do I know?\" Ryan looked from Nick to Brandon to Tara to Derek, desperately seeking an ally, but everyone just glared at him. Nick actually felt sorry for him. It was not as though Ryan was doing this maliciously; he was a realtor, and he was just trying to do his job the best he could. It seemed that Ryan often had blinders on until the truth was pointed out to him by Cassie … but that was not going to happen this time. Cassie had rejected Ryan in favor of Sam, and though they may have smoothed things over, Nick knew that heartbreak did not go away overnight. Ryan would not spend enough time with Cassie to hear what she had to say. Nick was more concerned for the well being of the people of Middleton, himself included. So far, these robbers were bold, striking in broad daylight, and they were not the least bit hesitant to use their weapons. This was way out of Brandon's league. Derek's too. It probably was out of Jake's league, but not having met the late police chief, Nick could not really say. He just hoped that these men would either move on or slip up and get caught before anyone else got hurt. GW Grace sat at the kitchen table while her mom cooked dinner when the phone rang. Grace could not help but smile as her mother's face split into a grin. Cassie Nightingale clearly already knew who it was as she answered. \"Hello Sam. You and Nick having trouble finding the ….\" Suddenly, her mother's face drained of color and her body went rigid. \"Sam … is she going to be ….\" Cassie listened as Sam spoke, and then nodded. \"What about Brandon and Tara?\" The Merriwick matriarch nodded as she listened, seeming relieved. \"Thank you, Sam. Do what you can. Call me as soon as you know.\" She nodded again. \"I love you too.\" \"Mom?\" Grace went to her mother's side. \"Is everything alright?\" \"The Middleton Bandits were about to rob the Bell Book when Brandon and his partner showed up,\" Cassie explained. \"They … there was a gunfight.\" Grace gasped, her hands going to her mouth. She thought her heart would explode, it was racing so fast. \"Brandon is alright, but his partner – she's badly injured and Sam is about to operate on her now.\" \"What about Tara?\" \"She's okay, Grace … but I almost lost Brandon the way I lost …\" Cassie took a deep breath. \"Your father.\"[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 Grace Lashield had found her way to the Middleton Microbrew and sat at the bar doing tequila shots. Middleton. The town was everything she had never had. It was this idyllic little place that could almost be like Heaven. She felt like she had walked into some kind of alternate reality where people did not really suck, and everyone was looking out for everyone else. She wondered if that could have happened for her and Nolan. Could things have worked out for them? Nick Gunar found his happily ever after. Had things gone differently, could Grace have found hers too? Sadly, the opportunity to find out was taken from them. She downed another shot, the painful memories refusing to leave her mind's eye. \"Cassie?\" A man took his seat next to her. She had no idea who he was, but clearly, he thought Grace was Cassie Nightingale. \"Go away,\" she slurred. \"I don't want company.\" \"Cassie … you're drunk!\" \"My prerogative, now go away.\" The man shook his head, looking at her incredulously. \"Is this about Brandon almost getting shot? Believe me, after what you've been through, I understand. But if it's about the Grand-Mart ….\" \"Are you really that dense?\" Grace shook her head. \"Hate to disappoint you, but I don't even know who you are, let alone whatever nonsense it is you're whining about.\" \"Cassie, it's me – Ryan! Are you that drunk?\" \"Not yet,\" Grace replied, \"but I'm working on it.\" \"Cassie ….\" \"I'm not Cassie, and we've never met.\" Grace downed a sixth shot. \"Now, scram before I decide you're harassing me and do something about it.\" Ryan backed away and presumably left – Grace did not bother to see if he actually left the building or just sat elsewhere. She looked back at the bartender. \"Hit me again – seven's my lucky number.\" \"Sorry ma'am,\" the African American man behind the bar replied, \"but I think I need to cut you off. If you need a ride, I can call an Uber or Lyft for you, but I can't let you drive.\" Grace made a scoffing sound and shook her head, a mirthless smile on her face. \"No, I don't suppose you can.\" She contemplated taking him up on the ride, but then a shrill voice caught her attention, calling out that name again. \"Cassie!\" Grace's shoulders slumped. It seemed like everyone in Middleton knew the owner of Grey House. How could anyone be that popular? She turned around slowly and saw a shapely blonde woman who looked to be about five foot four, though without heels, Grace estimated her to be about five feet. \"You talkin' to me?\" \"Cassie,\" the woman exclaimed, immediately taking the seat next to Grace. \"What is wrong? I've never seen you like this, not even when Jake died!\" \"Cassie's probably never been like this,\" Grace replied, slurring her words. \"The name's Grace Lashield. You are?\" \"Stephanie – I own the Bistro.\" Stephanie studied Grace for a moment or two, and then said, \"Huh; you really aren't Cassie. But the resemblance ….\" \"Yeah, separated at birth, I know.\" \"Were you really?\" Grace laughed. She knew that if she said yes, Stephanie would believe it. She could string Stephanie along with whatever crazy tall tale she felt like telling. Instead, she mentioned the Bistro. \"Cassie recommended your place – the Bistro, that is.\" \"Where are you staying, Grace Lashield?\" \"Grey House. Why?\" \"Because you're in no condition to drive. I was just heading home. Would you like a ride?\" Grace nodded. She had had about enough of the bar at this point. \"Sure. Why not?\" Stephanie helped the taller Grace to her feet and the two of them left. As they passed Ryan, who had found a table, he stood. \"Stephanie ….\" \"Do not speak to me,\" the restauranteur scolded. \"We are not friends!\" \"But Stephanie ….\" \"No buts, Ryan – your plans are going to put me under! Me, and half the shops in Middleton!\" \"You want me to kick his ass?\" Grace offered. \"You're drunk,\" Ryan scoffed. \"Wouldn't be much of a fight.\" \"Probably not,\" Grace agreed. \"I'm a mean drunk – might actually put you in the hospital.\" \"Come on,\" Stephanie directed, pulling Grace along with her. \"He's not worth the effort.\" Ryan let out a frustrated sigh and Grace giggled at the sight. He was truly pathetic. He reminded her of those two yuppie scum-buckets who ran Nitro-Mine. \"No, he's not.\" GW Cassie sat in the kitchen enjoying a glass of wine. It was late, but she felt as though her presence was needed. Grace and George had both turned in early and Sam was still at the hospital saving Officer Thompkins' life. Dinner had gone well enough – Nick had returned with the things Cassie had asked for, after which, Grace Lashield had called an Uber and headed to the Microbrewery. Cassie's other guest, a Nick Gunar, had not checked in, though she had a feeling that she would see him tomorrow. Now, the day was done, and Cassie remained up. Somebody needed her, and she knew exactly who. As if on cue, she heard the key turn in the lock on the front door, and then heard the front door open. Stephanie's voice. \"Here we are, Grace. Come on – I see a light in the kitchen. Cassie's up.\" Moments later, Stephanie helped a visibly drunk Grace Lashield into the kitchen. Cassie rose and pulled out a chair for the inebriated woman. \"Oh, my,\" Stephanie gasped. \"You two really do look alike!\" \"You confused me for Cassie already,\" Grace slurred. \"Of course, we look alike.\" Cassie nodded. \"Good things come in pairs.\" \"I found her at the bar,\" Stephanie said. \"Liam's bartender cut her off, and Ryan was acting like jerk, so I gave her a ride back here.\" \"Thanks, Stephanie,\" Cassie replied. \"I have just the thing.\" \"Well good,\" Stephanie said approvingly. \"I have to be up early, so I am off to bed. See you at the Bistro tomorrow?\" \"On my way to the Bell Book,\" Cassie confirmed. \"See you then.\" As soon as Stephanie left, Cassie began boiling water in the kettle. A nice chamomile tea should do the trick, she thought. \"So, Grace, how was the Microbrewery?\" The drunk woman shrugged. \"Nice enough. They cut me off before I was finished. One more shot … that might have done it.\" \"Done what?\" Grace looked down at the table in silence for a few moments, and then the kettle whistled its readiness. Cassie prepared a cup of chamomile tea for her guest and then placed it before her, taking the seat to Grace's right. \"For you, Grace.\" Grace Lashield, in addition to looking like Cassie, was the same age. According to Cassie's daughter, Grace, the two women even shared the same birthday. The two women had so much in common, and yet, could not be more different. While Cassie was happily engaged and looking forward to her second once-in-a-lifetime, Grace Lashield carried a deep sadness in her eyes. She had a lot of miles on her body too – hard miles. While Cassie relied entirely on her intuition, intelligence, and compassion, Grace kept her emotions close and carried a gun. Grace looked up at Cassie, tears in her eyes. \"I was jealous of you, you know? You have this … perfect life in this perfect town. You have a perfect man. I can see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice – he loves you more than life itself.\" Cassie nodded. \"It hasn't always been so, but right now, I am content.\" \"You get it,\" Grace declared. \"You … lost someone. Stephanie thought I was you … that I was drunk because of … I don't know why, but she said you weren't like this even when Jake died.\" Cassie nodded again, then leaned in close. \"You've lost someone too, Grace, haven't you?\" Cassie's look-alike nodded, tears now streaming down her face. The tough-gal façade cracked and fell away, and Grace Lashield began to sob. \"We never had a chance. They … blew his head off right after he kissed me. I watched his head … his blood sprayed all over me!\" Now, her eyes were on fire and her face twisted in grief and rage. \"They killed him all for fucking money! They killed him 'cause we wouldn't let them just kill the natives! I never got to find out if it would work! All I wanted was just a little happiness. Is that too much to ask?\" \"No, it isn't, Grace.\" Cassie put her arm around the sobbing merc and sat quietly as Grace Lashield cried her eyes out. Finally, the tears receded, and Grace took a sip of the tea. \"My husband was the police chief here in Middleton,\" Cassie said. \"A man shot him dead after robbing a convenience store.\" She shook her head, the memory bringing tears to her own eyes. \"Jake wasn't even on duty. He was stopping off to pick up Slurpees for the kids. He just … walked into it, and the man killed him.\" \"That's terrible,\" Grace said flatly. \"It nearly killed me,\" Cassie confessed. \"But … years passed, and things got better. I found my way, and then, just when I thought I was content having had my once-in-a-lifetime …\" Cassie smiled. \"I met Sam, and once-in-a-lifetime happened again.\" Grace offered a tearful grin. \"Thanks for listening. I hate gettin' all maudlin, but …\" She downed the tea. \"I guess I needed that. Haven't told anyone that since I left the island back in ninety-four.\" Cassie gasped. \"You've carried that inside for twenty-four years? Oh, Grace.\" Cassie gave her a hug. \"I'm honored that you chose to share that with me. It was deeply personal and could not have been easy.\" Cassie's doppelganger smiled back at her. \"I couldn't have told that to anyone except maybe Nick Gunar. But you're easy to talk to.\" \"Nick Gunar?\" That got Cassie's attention. \"Yeah.\" Grace laughed. \"The old Swede hired me on for the job – we were supposed persuade the natives to move off an island in the South China Sea. Found out we were workin' for the wrong side and the mission changed to defending the natives. We won, but it was costly. Nick stayed with a native girl named Loki, and her son – Kamnan, I think it was.\" Cassie nodded, realizing that this woman's background went well beyond the military or security. She was a gun for hire – a soldier of fortune. The woman looked like she belonged in the cast of the next Expendables movie. This also confirmed that Nick Gunar was the same Nick Gunar that had missed his check-in; Grace Russell had gushed about meeting Kam Gunar earlier the day before. She imagined that Nick Gunar was probably a lot like Grace Lashield – a hardened mercenary. \"I imagine that was a difficult decision on your part.\" Grace shook her head. \"Not my decision – Gunar made the call. We were all free to leave if we didn't want to join him. Thought he made the right call, so I stayed. Half the team left and came back with reinforcements for the people who originally hired us. Nolan figured out they were scum real fast and switched back to our side.\" She wiped her eyes again. \"They killed him for it. I almost bought it myself.\" Cassie nodded again, appreciating the full scope of what happened. \"What happened to Nick?\" \"Don't know. Still on the island far as I know. Not like there's any cell service there.\" Grace took a few more sips of the tea. \"What did you do after that?\" \"Got real picky,\" Grace explained. \"After seeing Nick stand up for what's right, I couldn't go back to my old life. Did some K and R ….\" \"K and R?\" \"Kidnap and Rescue,\" Grace explained. \"Got into security for relief organizations and stuff like that. Thing is, the good guys usually don't pay all that much and rarely have steady work. Bounced from place to place, guy to guy …\" she laughed mirthlessly. \"Lots of guys who think no means yes. Tried going from girl to girl ….\" Cassie's eyes widened slightly, and then she nodded understanding. \"Yeah.\" Grace made a scoffing sound. \"I met some real prizes doing that too, if you know what I mean.\" \"I think I do,\" Cassie replied with a nod. \"Never found what I was looking for. Lot of people happy to use me, but … nobody who really wanted me. Nolan did – he was different. Now, he's dead. Seemed like drinking was the only thing that helped.\" Cassie leaned close. \"Grace, I think things are about to change for the better. I went through some hard times before I came to Middleton, but I found what I was looking for – twice. Sam was going through a lot when he came here, and he found me. My cousin, Abigail came here, and she found a home too. Now she's the mayor.\" The mercenary scoffed. \"Really? You think I'm here in Middleton and all my problems will just magically go away? Get real, Cassie – that ain't how life works.\" \"Middleton is filled with magic,\" Cassie countered with a smile. \"Stick around – you'll see.\" Grace looked at her dubiously. \"You believe in magic? Really?\" Cassied nodded. \"With all my heart, Grace. And I believe something magical will happen for you.\" Grace shrugged and offered Cassie a reluctant smile. \"If it happens, I won't complain … but I ain't holdin' my breath.\" \"I promise you won't turn blue.\" The two women laughed, and Cassie poured Grace another tea and herself another glass of wine. She pondered the mercenary whose face was a mirror image of her own. Was Grace Lashield a long lost Merriwick? Could she be lost family? If so, this might prove a magical experience for everyone.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 Brandon walked into the station house, the fate of his partner, Jill Thompkins, still on his mind. Sam had saved her. According to the paramedics, had it not been for Doctor Radford's timely arrival, Jill would probably have died before she ever made it to the hospital. Nick had said that as soon as they heard the gunfire and Ryan's stolen Mercedes blew past them, Sam really stepped on it to get to the scene. Brandon shook his head, smiling in spite of himself. Sam Radford drove into the crime scene, not away from it, and jumped right in as soon as he arrived. Tara had told him that Sam flew to Colombia in the spring to assist evacuations during the heavy flooding. Sam Radford may not be a policeman, but Brandon was very impressed with the man's courage and selflessness. In a few very important ways, Sam Radford reminded Brandon of his father, the late police chief, Jake Russell. He talked with Cassie and Grace on the phone last evening, and while Cassie seemed to be fairly calm about the whole thing, he imagined that inside, she was beside herself. For all her intuition, Cassie worried. She knew that her intuition was blind to certain things. Jake was killed, and neither she nor Grace ever saw it coming, and what happened yesterday was a whole level above that. Not only had Brandon been in danger, but so was Tara. Shootouts simply did not happen in Middleton, and a shootout involving Brandon with Tara right nearby had to have terrified her. \"Brandon!\" It was Derek. The police chief walked hastily toward him, more like he was both trying to get to Brandon quickly, and get away from something quickly. \"Hey, Derek. What's going on? The Bandits didn't strike again, did they?\" \"No, but we did find Ryan's car – they ditched it, just like you thought they would. And another car has been reported stolen not far from where we found Ryan's car, so ….\" \"So, they're still in the area,\" Brandon finished. \"Anything other new developments?\" \"Yeah; Lori's here,\" Derek warned. \"Oh ….\" \"Yeah,\" Derek agreed. \"She's covering the Middleton Bandits for the Eagle. But I have an assignment for you, and you need to do it before you see Lori.\" \"Oh?\" Brandon was not sure he liked the sound of that. \"Yeah. I'm having you interview our applicant, Nick Gunar. If we still like him, then I'll give him a second interview.\" \"You're not trying to skate out of interviewing him, are you?\" \"No … but I thought maybe since I'm grooming you for lieutenant, it would be good to make you part of the hiring process.\" Derek was serious, but it did not take Cassie's intuition to know that Derek was also trying to get out of it for some reason. \"Derek, what's going on?\" \"Louise will get you the deets.\" Brandon looked at Derek with puzzlement. \"Deets?\" \"Details,\" Derek explained. \"I'm trying to sound more youthful. Is it working?\" \"I don't know – maybe?\" \"The new receptionist, Louise,\" Derek explained. \"I want to appear professionally aloof, but I also want to be approachable. It's something Cassie's really good at. I'm hoping maybe I can impress her enough to get her to go to dinner with me sometime. I chatted with her a little, but then I got nervous, so I wanted to look like I had something important to do ….\" \"And if I go to interview Gunar, that occupies her for long enough for you to find something befitting your rank to do.\" Derek grinned. Brandon smiled and nodded. \"Alright, Chief. I'm on it.\" \"Thanks, Brandon. Here …\" Derek handed Brandon two twenty-dollar bills. \"Take Tara to dinner tonight on me.\" \"Thanks. I will.\" Brandon walked into the lobby and over to Louis's desk as he contemplated where he might take Tara after work. \"Ah, Officer Russell,\" Louise called. She was a pleasant enough woman. She was attractive and had a nice, wholesome quality about her. Louise's straight blonde hair fell to her shoulders, and she looked up at Brandon from behind a large pair of thick glasses. \"Hey, Louise. What's going on?\" \"There's a really big older guy over by your desk. Derek said you'd know what it was about.\" Brandon shrugged. \"Thanks, Louise. I'll get right on it.\" He imagined a really big older guy to mean a stocky older guy with a beer gut. When he got to his desk, he saw broad shouldered blond man seated opposite his own chair. \"Nick Gunar? I'm Brandon Russell. Pleased to meet you.\" The large man wore khaki Dockers pants, a dark red shirt, and a brown sport coat. He turned in the chair to face Brandon, and the younger man realized that Nick Gunar was almost as tall as he was while still seated. Nick Gunar nodded and stood. Brandon found himself looking up and up as Nick Gunar's form ascended. At his full height, Nick Gunar was noticeably taller than Derek. Even taking into account the chief's slouch, Derek was a tall man. Nick Gunar was taller and had posture that screamed military. Gunar had to be a solid six foot five, and instead of being portly with a bear gut, he was lean and muscular. Even wearing the jacket, there was no hiding the man's massive shoulders and bulging chest. Brandon estimated Gunar to weigh something in the neighborhood of two-forty, all of it muscle, sinew, and bone. Gunar's face was lined from age, but still looked like it was carved from granite. In his younger days, Brandon imagined that the man had looked like Ivan Drago. \"Nick Gunar,\" the man said in a low growl of a voice. Brandon accepted Gunar's handhake, and took note of the big Swede's massive hands. He imagined that Nick Gunar could palm a basketball with one hand, and probably had the strength to deflate it. The man's hands were like steel and the knuckles were enlarged, as though he had spent many years using his fists. Knowing what was on Gunar's resume and seeing the man standing before him, Brandon had a new appreciation for the applicant. Nick Gunar was a hardened, seasoned man. Now, he knew why Derek had really wanted to get away. While Brandon had only been a police officer for about four years, he could see that Gunar was a dangerous man. \"Won't you have a seat?\" Brandon tried to stay cool. Gunar was not here to shoot up the station, after all; he wanted to join them. In spite of his age, the man was certainly fit enough for Middleton. Gunar and Brandon sat and began the interview. Brandon took a brief moment to look at Gunar's job application which Derek had conveniently left in a folder on his desk. He noted Nick's date of birth – November first, nineteen fifty-seven. That made him sixty-one years old. \"Thank you for applying to the Middleton Police Department,\" Brandon began. \"My first question is this: why would a man your age be looking to begin a career in law enforcement?\" Gunar shrugged. \"Been a soldier all my life. My son is a professor at Haverhill and wants me to move to Middleton; says I'd like it here. So far, it looks nice, but a man's got to work. The only thing I know how to do is be a soldier. I've done bodyguard work, security work, and mercenary work. Been in the Army ….\" \"Yeah, special forces, I see.\" Gunar nodded. \"Yup. Look, Officer Russell; I appreciate that you cut to the chase instead of beating around the bush – I prefer to talk straight. So, let me get right to the point. You can use me. I have the experience, and I have the skills. I've fought wars on twelve continents and done security in the most dangerous places on the planet. I didn't know about your bandit problem when I applied, but I can handle myself in a shootout. Not only am I an expert marksman, but I can handle your squad-cars, I can ride police bikes, I can drive boats, and fly choppers and planes. And I guarantee you my hand to hand skills are more than up to the task.\" Brandon nodded, surprised at how much he found himself agreeing with the man. Certainly, if even half of what Gunar claimed was true, the man was way overqualified. If he had a son teaching at Haverhill, clearly, Gunar had raised a fine young man and had skills that went beyond just killing people. He wondered what Cassie would think of Nick Gunar. He decided that she would see the best in the old Swede and would welcome him with open arms. Cassie had been a mom to him for longer than Jennifer Russell, Jake's first wife, had been, and by now, was his primary maternal figure. What would Cassie do? What would Jake have done? Brandon decided that since Derek had already done all of the prep work and the only thing they were really waiting on was the background check, he would not be the one to stop Nick Gunar. If the man wanted to settle in Middleton to live near his son and enjoy a quiet life, who was Brandon to say no? If the background check came back clean, then Derek could bring him in for a second interview. \"You make a strong case, Mister Gunar. I think we could use you. Once the background check comes back, we'll be in touch.\" Brandon stood and Gunar stood with him, towering over the young police officer. The two men shook hands, Nick Gunar offering an approving but faint smile. \"I appreciate the opportunity.\" Brandon watched as the large merc walked away. As much as Gunar was dangerous, Brandon did not feel nervous around him. Certainly, picking a fight with Nick Gunar would be a mistake, but there was a gentleness about the rough looking merc that surprised the younger policeman. A lot of people came to Middleton for a chance at a new life. Brandon hoped that Middleton could give that to Nick Gunar. GW Lori stood as Brandon rounded the corner. It was like déjà vu. The last time they had a conversation like this, Lori was angry at Brandon's decision to join the police force. Now, she was genuinely worried for his safety, but had no interest in dissuading him from police work. \"Brandon,\" she called as he walked to her. Brandon never got over how childlike his sister had remained. Though older than Grace, Lori was a few inches shorter than Cassie's daughter, and her voice still sounded the same as it had back in the eighth grade. Lori had remained very slender and never really filled out, making her look like a high school girl rather than the twenty-six-year-old journalist that she was. \"Hey, Lori. How's the Eagle treating you?\" Lori responded by hugging him tightly. \"When I heard you were in a shootout … all I could think of was Dad.\" Brandon held her. \"I know. But I knew I would be alright. I thought for a moment that I heard his voice. I know it sounds crazy, but ….\" \"We grew up with Cassie,\" Lori noted. \"I believe it. I'm just glad you're alright. How's Officer Thompkins?\" \"Thanks to Sam, she's alive. Beyond that, I won't know until I go over to the hospital later this morning.\" Lori nodded. \"How was your interview? Derek said you were interviewing someone for the force.\" Brandon thought for a moment and then smiled. \"Pretty good, actually. I was kind of skeptical about the guy, but I think he'll be a good fit.\" Lori smiled back at him. \"I'm glad to hear. Now, I need to get to the official reason I'm here: I'm covering the robberies. I've already talked to Derek, but I wanted your take.\" \"Well, the robbers are violent. I don't think they're locals gone bad, though I suppose anything's possible. Thing is, they don't seem to be leaving. We think they're staying in the area precisely because of our small-town police force. The same kinds of crimes went down in Blairsville a couple of months back, but there were three of them. They think the third one was killed in a shootout, but the crooks got away.\" \"So, they came here because we're smaller than Blairsville.\" Brandon nodded. \"That's the theory. Between this and Ryan's real estate schemes with Jones, a lot of people in Middleton are nervous.\" \"Yes,\" Lori agreed. \"The Grand-Mart. I imagine that would have everyone nervous.\" \"Yeah; even Cassie. They have something called a Life-Books in their store. It's like a chain version of the Bell, Book & Candle, complete with Yankee Candle Company merchandise, new age and world music, and all kinds of pseudo-mystical self-help books.\" \"But no Cassie,\" Lori said with assurance. \"Nobody can duplicate Cassie.\" \"That won't matter,\" Brandon countered. \"People will already be in this place. It has a Java Shed, a pharmacy, an optometrist, and copies of pretty much every small business in Middleton. Everywhere a Grand-Mart opens, the local shops go under and everyone ends up working for Grand-Mart part time at minimum wage with no benefits. If this thing goes in, it'll be really bad for us.\" \"That's very astute of you, Brandon. Can I quote you?\" \"Sure.\" \"Thanks.\" Lori smiled and hugged her brother again. \"I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Let me know as soon as you hear about Jill. She was a classmate of mine. We weren't close, but … she's a nice girl. I hope she's okay.\" \"Soon as I know, I'll call.\" \"Thanks.\" They hugged one last time and Lori left the station, her mission accomplished. Brandon was glad that their reunion had been without any of the tension that they had when he joined the force. He only hoped that this recent bout of danger would not upset Cassie and Grace too much. Brandon still had not seen them in person since the shootout, but later today, he planned to stop by Grey House. Then, they would almost certainly let him know how they felt.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 It was ten in the morning, and Cassie opened the Bell, Book & Candle for a new day. She had given Tara the day off – the near-robbery of and the shootout between her husband and the robbers left Cassie's part time help more than a little shaken. Somehow, the robbers had been kept from Tara. Cassie smiled at that. Perhaps the Bell Book really did have a charm against the negative. Her cell phone rang, and she looked at the caller ID. Seeing Sam's picture, she answered. \"Please tell me you have good news!\" \" Jill will be alright ,\" Sam assured. \" She should recover and even be able to go on and take the position in Chicago. How's Tara doing? That was pretty intense yesterday. \" \"She's shaken up, Sam. To tell you the truth, I am too; I almost lost Brandon.\" \" But you didn't ,\" Sam assured. \" Life is unpredictable, Cassie. Believe me, I know. But you don't usually get caught up in 'what-ifs' and 'could-haves.' I know this hits close to home, but don't start down that path; it'll never end .\" Cassie could not help but smile as Sam took on the roll that Cassie normally played. She loved that he could be that source of encouragement and calm for her that she tried to be for everyone else. She was about to tell him how much she loved that about him. She was about to tell him how much she loved him. Instead, she gasped as a late model Honda Accord screeched to a stop in front of the Bell Book, two ski-mask clad men jumping out, guns drawn. \"Oh, my God, Sam! They're back!\" \" Cassie …. \" \"Call 911 for me!\" \" On it. \" Sam hung up to do as Cassie asked, but she hardly felt reassured. The two men barged in, the smaller one heading straight for her while his partner began looking for merchandise to take. \"The till and the safe – now!\" The smaller one, about Cassie's height, was now right up in her face, leaning across the counter, gun pointed at her. With his free hand, he deposited a plastic bag on the counter. \"Fill it!\" She briefly wondered if this was how Jake felt right before he was killed. As Cassie began to open the till, she noticed the front door open briefly. A large blond man stealthily made his way inside, avoiding the notice of either of the robbers, and proceeded to disappear behind one of the free-standing display cases. Cassie simply nodded and began emptying the contents of the till into the bag. \"Faster!\" The smaller man was screaming at her. He began cursing and making like he was going to hit her. Cassie simply nodded and sped up just slightly. As the larger robber walked by the free-standing display case where the third man had hidden, the blond man popped up, grabbed the robber, placing his hand over the man's mouth, and pulled the robber down behind the case in eerie silence. As she continued to load the bag, the blond man stood from behind the case. He was tall, taller than her adventurous admirer, John Dover, and John was about six-three or six-four. The tall man approached, his steps making not a sound. He moved with sinuous grace, closing the gap between himself and her assailant. Then she heard the sound of sirens. \"Scott,\" the robber shouted, \"she's got the bag loaded! We gotta roll, man!\" When Scott did not answer, he shouted, \"Scott?\" When Scott failed to answer a second time, he turned around, finding himself face to face with the large blond man. \"You're not Scott!\" \"And you're not very smart,\" the blond man growled with a bit of a sneer. Before Cassie even saw him move, the blond man grabbed the robber's weapon hand, and with some kind of jujutsu technique, took hold of the gun. With a sudden counter clockwise twist of his body and sharp downward pressing of his hands, the large man broke the robber's wrist with a loud crack and took the gun as the robber fell to the floor. The blond man then followed up by bringing a massive booted foot down on the robber's face, knocking him out cold. He then walked over to the first robber and picked his gun up from the floor and then returned to the counter, placing both of the robbers' guns down atop it. Then he looked at Cassie, and his eyes widened. \"No way ….\" \"Excuse me?\" She looked at him with puzzlement, unsure of where this was going, her heart still racing from the ordeal. \"Of all the places,\" he said with visible surprise. \"I never thought I'd see you again. You alright?\" Who was this man? Cassie had never seen him before, though she was very thankful for his timely arrival. His gruff voice had a slight accent – Swedish? \"Yes … I … I will be,\" she assured, her voice still trembling. \"Right now, I'm ….\" \"It's alright,\" he said casually, placing his massive right hand on her shoulder reassuringly. \"We've been through worse.\" Cassie looked at him with puzzlement. \"Excuse me?\" \"Grace Lashield – you don't remember me … do you?\" He shook his head and made a slight laugh. \"You really have changed, haven't you?\" Now Cassie understood. \"I'm not who you think I am.\" He raised his left eyebrow in puzzlement. Cassie just smiled and extended her right hand. \"Cassie Nightingale.\" The man accepted her handshake, his massive hand enveloping hers. His grip was firm – a good business handshake – but not bone crushing. \"Nick Gunar,\" he said. \"I thought you were ….\" \"I have a look-alike. Grace Lashield is staying at Grey House.\" Then she smiled again. \"And you missed your check-in last night, Nick Gunar.\" \"Grace? She's here?\" Middleton's enchantress nodded. \"She is. I think seeing you will do her good.\" Before they could continue the conversation, two squad cars pulled up, and Brandon and Derek jumped out, guns drawn. The two of them practically burst through the door of the Bell Book. \"Cassie!\" Brandon ran to her, hugging her tightly. \"You okay?\" \"Thanks to Nick Gunar, yes.\" Derek looked at the two unconscious robbers. \"I'd say so.\" \"No shots fired,\" Cassie assured. \"Nobody's in danger.\" \"Nick,\" Brandon, said, \"you weren't kidding about your hand to hand skills.\" \"I think we've got a new man on the force,\" Derek said with a huge grin. Nick Gunar nodded, a look of pleasant surprise on his face. \"Thanks. Didn't think you guys were gonna hire me cause of my age.\" \"That, and you're really scary,\" Derek said with a sheepish grin. \"But Brandon said he liked you, and clearly, you can do your job, so … when can you start?\" \"Soon as your background check says I can,\" Nick replied. Cassie smiled and let out a deep sigh of relief. The Middleton Bandits had been caught and nobody had been killed. She picked up her phone and called Sam. \" Cassie! \" \"It's alright, Sam,\" she assured. \"A guardian angel happened by and Brandon and Derek are taking custody of the Middleton Bandits. I'll tell you about it when you get here.\" \" I'm driving now. I'll be there in a few minutes .\" \"I know.\" \" How? \" \"You're on your car speakerphone,\" she said with a giggle. \"Kind of a give-away.\" \" I love you, Cassie .\" \"I love you too, Sam. See you in a few minutes.\" Cassie hung up the phone and looked up at her large rescuer. \"So, Nick, when are you checking in at Grey House?\" \"This afternoon,\" he replied. \"Right now, I'm meeting my son for brunch at the Bistro.\" \"Sam will be here anytime. Need a lift?\" The big Swede shrugged. \"Sure.\" True to form, Sam arrived minutes later. He ran into the Bell Book calling, \"Cassie,\" before hugging his fiancée tightly. \"I'm okay, Sam,\" she replied. \"Thanks to my timely rescuer, Nick Gunar.\" Sam looked up at Nick Gunar. It was the first time Cassie had ever seen her fiancé crane his neck to look another man in the eye. \"Nick, this is Doctor Sam Radford; my fiancé.\" \"You have my thanks,\" Sam exclaimed, shaking Nick's hand. \"Cassie is my … she's the most amazing woman in the world. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone differently.\" He shook his head, seeming to shudder at the thought of losing Cassie. \"If there's anything I can do for you ….\" Gunar shrugged. \"Cassie says you can drive me to the Bistro. Beyond that, I'm good.\" \"We could use you, Sam,\" Derek called. \"Both the perps are unconscious, and I think one has a broken wrist.\" Sam nodded and Cassie waited patiently as Sam tended to her would-be robbers. Her future husband woke them up and worked to keep them awake. \"I need to know what you did to them,\" Sam said, looking at Nick. \"Did you knock them both out?\" \"Just the one,\" Nick replied. \"Put the other in a sleeper.\" Sam nodded and resumed treating them. Soon, the ambulance arrived, and Doctor Radford stood. \"I've set his wrist as best I could,\" Sam instructed the paramedics as they came to take charge of the concussed robber. \"Keep him awake – he's suffered a concussion. He has a broken orbital and possible skull fracture from the boot to the head.\" Cassie winced at Sam's assessment. Even though the men had tried to rob her, she still found the violence against them distasteful. They were human beings. They were still people in need of care. Whatever their crimes, she hated to see them injured. The paramedics looked over at Nick Gunar. \"His boot?\" one of them asked of Sam. Doctor Radford nodded. \"Thanks, man!\" The paramedic went over and shook Gunar's hand. \"One of these goons pistol whipped my sister at her shop.\" \"Just did what I had to,\" Gunar replied. \"Did you have to stomp on his head?\" Cassie asked. \"Yes.\" Gunar did not sound like he enjoyed it, though it clearly did not bother him. His response was matter of fact. \"The threat needed to be neutralized and I didn't want to kill him.\" Cassie nodded with a reserved smile. \"And I appreciate that nobody was killed in my shop. Thank you, Nick.\" Gunar gave a slight nod. \"You're welcome.\" Derek and Brandon took statements from Cassie, Nick, and Sam, and were about to leave, when Martha Tinsdale burst into the shop. \"Cassie! I came as soon as I heard! Those brutes didn't manhandle you, did they?\" Martha was out of breath, as though she had walked as fast as she could to get to the Bell Book. \"Thank you, Martha,\" the Merriwick matriarch assured. \"Thanks to Mister Gunar, I am safe, and the robbers are in police custody.\" \"He's joining the force,\" Derek added. \"Martha Tinsdale, meet Nick Gunar.\" As though noticing the six-foot five inch man for the first time, Martha suddenly looked at Nick, and then looked up and up. \"Oh, my,\" she said with a chuckle. \"Somebody ate their spinach.\" Then she gave Gunar's left arm a couple of pats. \"Strong stuff!\" Martha extended her hand. \"I am Martha Tinsdale, head of the Concerned Citizens League, and former mayor. Let me be the first to welcome you to our fair town.\" \"Don't you live in Blairsville?\" Derek asked somewhat condescendingly. \"Only because of that insipid border issue!\" Martha looked at Cassie for support, but it was Nick who spoke. \"Home is where the heart is, Chief Sanders.\" \"That's right,\" Middleton's former mayor exclaimed. Gunar shook the Martha's hand with a nod and a slight smile. \"Thanks for the welcome, Mrs. Tinsdale. Good to finally meet you.\" Mrs. Tinsdale grinned at this. \"You know of me then?\" \"Yes,\" the big Swede affirmed. \"My son is a professor at Haverhill – Kam Gunar. He met you earlier in the summer.\" The former mayor looked confused. She looked from Cassie to Derek, then back to Nick. \"You don't … look like him.\" Gunar just laughed. \"His mother was from Southeast Asia. I legally adopted him after I married her. After she passed away, Kam and I came back to the States.\" \"Oh.\" Martha paused for a moment. \"Sorry for your loss, Mister Gunar. However …\" Then she beamed. \"We're glad to have you here in Middleton. Now that I've confirmed that all is well, I must be off – I have a meeting with your cousin, Cassie. We have to stop Ryan.\" \"So, I hear,\" Cassie agreed. \"Then you know the urgency. I must vamoose! Ta ta!\" With that, Martha marched from Cassie's shop, off to see Mayor Pershing. Sam looked from Cassie to Nick. \"Well that was interesting. So – lunch; shall we?\" \"We shall,\" Cassie said as she looped her arm round Sam's. \"Coming Nick?\" Gunar nodded, and the three of them left, Cassie locking the shop behind her.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 The ride to the Bistro with Nick Gunar was brief – it was just a couple of blocks away. Gunar was not the talkative type either, so there was little conversation. \"I'm just glad you were there when you were,\" Sam said, filling the silence. \"You have my thanks.\" Gunar just nodded and said, \"You're welcome.\" As they rode in silence, it was Gunar who spoke next. \"Your Cassie is a dead ringer for an old friend of mine – an old friend who's staying at Grey House.\" \"Oh, Grace Lashield,\" Sam replied. \"We've met, and you're right; they're like identical twins.\" \"How's she doing? Grace, I mean.\" Sam nodded. \"Seems alright. We didn't officially meet, but she was with the security team earlier this year in Colombia when I was working with the relief agency after the floods.\" \"So, she's still working.\" \"Looks that way,\" Sam agreed. \"Don't know what brought her here. She returned something I'd lost, but I get the feeling that's not the real reason she traveled hundreds of miles to Middleton. Unless she's looking to be a cop, there's certainly no security work to be had.\" \"On that, we agree,\" Nick said as the Jeep came to a stop in front of the Bistro. \"Thanks for the lift, Doctor Radford.\" \"You just saved my fiancé,\" the doctor replied. \"Please, call me Sam.\" The two men shook hands. \"You got it, Sam. If you're at Grey House when I check in, I'll see you then.\" \"You play basketball?\" Nick nodded. \"I live next door to Gray House. Have a hoop in the driveway. If you're up for a pickup game ….\" \"Might take you up on that.\" With that, Nick Gunar exited the Jeep and headed for the Bistro. Sam grinned at the prospect of a game. It had been years since he had played with anyone truly capable, and Nick Gunar was tall enough to be a challenge on that front alone – and Sam loved a challenge. Nick Gunar stood outside the Bistro for a moment, just assessing the place. It was an old habit, but a good one; even in a place as idyllic as Middleton, there could be trouble. The Middleton Bandits had proven that. Of course, now that Nick had taken them out of commission, the biggest threat to Middleton was the spectre of Grand Mart. Nick hoped that the deal would fall through – he hated Grand Mart. The Bistro was well maintained and nicely appointed, having the look of a European café. The outdoor garden seating was enclosed by a wrought iron fence with nicely manicured shrubbery about the base, and the building's brick façade was that nice red brick that was rarely seen in modern construction. Walking up and down the sidewalk and seated at the outdoor tables of the Bistro were nice. Suburbanite folk; moms, young children, professionals on their lunch breaks, and retirees. It was unlike any place Nick Gunar had ever lived. Now, he had a job with the Middleton Police Department and a temporary residence at Grey House. He had enough money to stay there for more than a month, but he would hate to wear out his welcome. A familiar young man smiled at him from one of the tables and waved him over. It was his son. Nick nodded and opened the wrought iron gate and stepped into the outdoor seating area, and immediately, people took notice of him. He was dressed in casual clothes, but everything about him, from his world-worn features to his posture to his imposing physical size made him stand out. These people were just regular people; soft and pleasant. Nick Gunar was a killer, and no matter how dressed up he might be, there was no hiding it. The people did not know why he did not fit in; only that he did not, and that he made them nervous – just like he had made Chief Sanders nervous. People standing or making their way back to their tables gave him a wide berth as he made his way to his son's table. Once there, he took his seat. \"Kam.\" His son laughed. \"Man of few words as always, Dad.\" Nick smiled slightly. \"The less I say ….\" \"The more my work gets done,\" Kam sang, completing a verse in an Elton John song. \"Not what I was going to say, but that works.\" Kam laughed again. \"I understand congratulations are in order. Oh, I ordered for you by the way – coffee; black, and the best Philly cheesesteak you've ever had.\" A waitress brought the coffee, and said, \"You're sandwich will be right out, Sir.\" Nick nodded then turned back to his son. \"Yeah; I start work with the Middleton Police Department as soon as the background check clears.\" \"Really? That's awesome! Totally didn't see that one coming!\" The old Swede raised an eyebrow. \"What were the congratulations for?\" \"I heard you took down the Middleton Bandits.\" Nick nodded approvingly. \"Word travels fast.\" \"Martha blew through for her coffee and baguette – couldn't stop talking about it. Mentioned you by name. Said you like a middle aged He-Man.\" Then he laughed. \"The woman even held up a plastic knife and called out, \"by the Power of Grayskull\" with the whole place looking on. It was totally hilarious!\" The old Swede chuckled at the image. Having met Martha, he could completely imagine what it must have looked like. \"Martha was interesting,\" Nick finally said. \"I like her.\" \"Really?\" Kam looked surprised. \"A lot of people find her to be … an overbearing micromanager.\" Nick shrugged. \"She's not afraid of me.\" \"Dad, it's not like you're walking around with that bazooka.\" Then Kam looked worried. \"You … didn't bring that thing with you … did you?\" Gunar shrugged. \"Not yet, but when I find a place to live, yeah; it'll be coming with me.\" \"So, who's afraid of you?\" \"Chief Sanders for one,\" Gunar said. \"Huh.\" Kam looked puzzled. \"Wonder why. He's a pretty big guy and a cop.\" \"Same reason everyone else is,\" Nick explained. \"I'm a killer, Kam; a predator. I might not live that life anymore, but it's what I am, and on some level, they know that – and it scares them.\" \"Come on, Dad; you were a soldier. Soldiers sometimes have to kill people.\" \"I was a soldier,\" Nick agreed. \"But after serving a couple of tours, I became a soldier of fortune – a mercenary. Colonel Merrick didn't hire me because I was a nice guy. He hired me because he thought I could strongarm your people into leaving the island and knew that I'd kill if I had to.\" \"Well, you did kill,\" Kam reminded him. \"Just not the people he intended.\" \"Exactly,\" Nick replied. \"Your mother saved me. She made me something I could never have been without her. Then she died. Thanks to her, I could be a father to you, but just because a tiger can raise a deer doesn't make it any less of a tiger.\" Kam nodded, the analogy making sense to him. \"Sorry, Dad. I remember when you came to the island. I was young, but I remember. I was never afraid you.\" Nick smiled. \"I know. Neither was your mother.\" \"How did things go with Brandon? His little sister's going to be one of my students this fall.\" Kam then added, \"Apparently, she put a bug in Chief Sanders' ear. I think it got you the interview.\" \"I'll have to thank her when I meet her,\" Nick noted. \"Lieutenant Russell was nervous at first, but once we broke the ice we got along fine.\" \"Yeah. You've met their mom, right?\" \"Not sure. Who is she?\" \"Cassie Nightingale,\" Kam explained. \"Cassie is Brandon's mother?\" \"Stepmother,\" Kam clarified. \"Grace Russell is Brandon's half-sister.\" \"Cassie Nightingale,\" Nick mused. \"She looks just like Grace.\" \"Well, Cassie is her mother.\" \"Not that Grace.\" Kam looked puzzled, but Nick just smiled and chuckled. \"Doubt you remember her – she was on the job that brought me to the island.\" \"Vaguely.\" Kam looked unsure. \"Grace Lashield,\" Nick explained. \"She fought on my side when things went south. Haven't seen her since. Then her doppelganger tells me that Grace Lashield is staying at Grey House.\" Before Kam could respond, the waitress brought their sandwiches. The Philly Cheesesteak smelled delicious. Nick took a bite and nodded in approval. \"You're right,\" the big Swede declared. \"This really is the best Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had.\" \"Told ya.\"[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 \"What is it Martha?\" Abigail sighed, already frustrated with the recent turn of events. She put on her pre-packaged smile as Martha Tinsdale entered her office. The former mayor looked about, as though trying to locate some electronic monitoring system. \"How did you know I was ….\" \"What can I do for you, Martha?\" Abigail's voice was filled with a sweetness that was as artificial as her smile. \"We must strategize!\" Martha twirled her 'r's as she spoke, projecting her voice as though talking to a larger gathering, and gesticulating so as to look like she was either pantomiming or casting a Harry Potter spell. \"Grand-Mart; we must figure out how to put a stop to this infestation that threatens our town!\" Abigail sighed again, as Martha hit upon the very thing that had been frustrating Middleton's newest mayor. \"They've been courting the Town Council aggressively,\" the mayor shared, \"speaking the honeyed language that all small-town politicians find irresistible; money.\" \"Hmph,\" Martha said with a scowl. \"I'm surprised they haven't courted you.\" \"They have,\" Abigail replied. \"I turned them down. Why do you think they're wooing the Town Council, each with twice the money they tried throwing at me?\" \"Oh.\" Martha sounded both surprised and apologetic at Abigail's answer. \"I must admit, I am somewhat surprised that you turned them away.\" Abigail shook her head. \"I've dealt with enough devils in my life, Martha. I know one when I see one.\" \"Ryan Elliot is behind this,\" Martha groused. \"He needs to be stopped!\" \"As I recall, Martha,\" Abigail reminded her, \"it was you that he had to stop – back when you had similar plans as mayor. Honestly, I'm surprised to see you wanting to fight against the very thing that you once were trying to accomplish during your tenure as mayor.\" Martha deflated at Abigail's intentional jab. \"I've learned a lot since then,\" the former mayor said with a sigh. \"I had such grand plans back then – another term as mayor, then possibly governor.\" Then she shook her head. \"But I see things differently now. I'm back with the Concerned Citizens League …\" \"Even though you live in Blairsville,\" Abigail interjected. \"Yes, well – I've gone back to my roots. Who knows? Maybe I'll reopen Martha's Sweet Beginnings.\" \"Not if we have a Grand Mart,\" Abigail lamented. \"They have a bridal department too.\" Martha sighed. Abigail just nodded. This was a mess, and she was completely ill equipped to deal with fending off a corporate giant alone. \"Martha, Ryan had two crazy real-estate ventures with Jones that needed to be stopped. How did he get turned around?\" \"Cassie,\" Martha said with a sigh. \"She made him see the light.\" Then the former mayor's face lit up. \"Cassie! If anyone could do it, she can!\" Abigail shook her head. \"This is bigger than Ryan, Martha. And even if it wasn't, they're friendly acquaintances at best. They may have smoothed things over after she started seeing Sam, but they haven't spoken since.\" \"I know.\" Martha sighed again. \"But I still think Cassie's our best hope.\" \"I've been pounding my head against wall with this,\" Abigail confessed. \"Maybe you're right, though …\" then she smiled as an idea came to her, \"but not in the way that you think.\" Martha tilted her head and looked at Abigail with puzzlement. \"I don't understand.\" Abigail grinned, this time, a genuine smile. \"No, but you will.\" ","Summary":" May, 2018 – Somewhere in the Antioquia Province, Colombia It was the perfect storm. Somehow, Grace "},{"Movie":"Good Witch","Title":"A New Life","Author":"storyfan45","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12761964","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer—I obviously don't own Good Witch. Cassie walked into Grey House in a daze. The news that she received that afternoon had sent her into a kind of shock. She had spent the last hour or so driving around, trying to make sense of everything. Entering the kitchen to start dinner, she began pulling random things out of the cupboards. Just then, Grace walked in. \"Mom…\" No answer. Grace raised her voice, \"Mom!\" Cassie's head popped up and her eyes widened. \"Oh, hi, sweetheart. I'm just getting dinner ready.\" Grace looked around the kitchen at the random assortment of food on the counter. \"Mom, are you okay?\" she asked, as she placed her hand on her mom's shoulder. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\" Cassie nodded. \"I'll be okay. I think I'll go lie down for a bit, though. I'm not feeling very well. Do you mind making some chili for dinner?\" Cassie climbed the stairs slowly before entering her bedroom and sitting on the end of the bed. What was she going to tell Sam? How was he going to react? Maybe I should practice this, she thought. \"Sam…I have to tell you something,\" Cassie began. \"No, no,\" she cleared her throat, \"I have a surprise.\" She sighed and stared into the mirror across the room, the object that had replaced Sam while she was practicing her speech. \"Sam…I have some news.\" \"Some news?\" a deep voice rang out as the man in question entered their bedroom. \"What kind of news?\" Cassie jumped when he spoke, and turned around to face him. He stood there waiting for her response. When she didn't say anything, he spoke again. \"I just got home. Grace told me that you aren't feeling well. What's going on?\" he asked, concerned. She stared at him for a minute, trying to come up with words to tell him the news that would change their lives. \"Um…we're having chili for dinner tonight,\" she stammered, looking away. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and sat down next to her on the bed, taking her hand in his. \"Cassie, is everything alright? You've been a little jumpy for the past couple of days.\" She looked into his light blue eyes and nodded slowly until the look of concern on his face caused her to shake her head. She started crying and turned towards him, burying her face in his neck. He immediately wrapped his arms around her and held her gently against him. When she looked up into his face it was so full of alarm that she felt she had to tell him everything…and now. She took a deep breath. \"I just got back from my doctor and…,\" she stopped, unable to complete her sentence. Sam's eyebrows shot up close to his hairline. Being a doctor himself, he was uncomfortably familiar with all kinds of news that could come from a doctor's office. She was hesitating to tell him, so it must be really bad, he thought. Sam put his finger under her chin and lifted it up, bringing her eyes up to lock with his. \"Whatever it is, Cassie, we'll deal with it. What did your doctor say?\" he prompted gently. \"I'm pregnant,\" she blurted. Sam sat back, stunned. His mouth popped open as he stared at her, unable to form any words. Of everything that had been running through his head that could be going on with her, THAT wasn't even on the list. Cassie just sat there watching his reaction, giving him time to digest this life-changing information. \"Pregnant?\" he repeated. She nodded before placing her head in her hands. \"I'm too old for this! It's not safe for the baby or for me! There are so many things that could go wrong!\" she stammered through her tears. The sound of fear and panic in her voice snapped Sam out of his trance, and he held her closer. Finally, he smiled and pulled her hands away from her face, causing her to look up at him. \"Cassie. This may be some of the most insane and wonderful news I've ever heard. It's true that there are more POSSIBLE complications related to your age, but you've always been healthy. Even if there are complications, we'll deal with them, just like we have with every other challenge we've faced. Plus, I'm even older than you! I'll be 70 before this kid leaves the house!\" he said with a laugh. She looked up at him with a small smile on her face and he grinned. \"What a way to keep me young,\" he said as he bent down to kiss her softly. When he pulled back he chuckled. \"Well, I always did want a baseball team.\" Cassie laughed and swatted at him. All of a sudden his face got serious as he placed his hand on her abdomen, noticing for the first time the tiny bump that resided there. \"Seriously, though. A little bit of you and a little bit of me. You're giving me the greatest gift anyone could ever give,\" he whispered, beginning to tear up. Cassie covered his hand with hers, thinking about their little nugget that was growing underneath. Sam was right. They would be okay. They would ALL be okay.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer—I still don't own Good Witch, I still write fluff, and I love to explore the relationship/friendship between Grace and Sam. Sam woke up even before the soft morning light began peeking through the frosted window in his bedroom. It was still early, so he was happy to see Cassie still sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he carefully climbed out of bed and headed for the kitchen for some coffee. He hadn't had a lot of sleep the night before; his normally logical brain was rattled with anxieties. The news of a new family member was incredibly exciting, but terrifying at the same time. He was leaning against the counter sipping his coffee when Grace entered the kitchen. \"Oh, hey, Sam. Couldn't sleep?\" she asked, as she reached for the tea kettle. He gave her a small smile in greeting and shook his head. \"Not really. What are you doing up this early?\" he queried, as he nursed his coffee mug between his hands. \"We have finals this week, remember? Nick might be blissfully sleeping without a care in the world, but I can't stop thinking about my Biology final later this morning.\" she replied. Sam chuckled. \"Why doesn't that surprise me? It's amazing how different you two are, but that you were still able to become good friends,\" he said, as he drained the last of his coffee and reached for the pot to pour some more. Grace grinned as she grabbed a mug from the cupboard. \"Kind of like you and mom?\" He laughed and nodded. While she was waiting for the water to boil, she eyed him carefully. He had dark circles under his eyes and he looked exhausted. \"Sam, what's going on?\" she asked. \"Is there something wrong that I should know about?\" Sam sighed. He and Cassie agreed to tell the kids together, and soon, but they hadn't figured out how to broach the subject. It was going to be a shock to both of them. \"Everything's fine,\" he said, unconvincingly. Grace walked over and put her hand on his arm. \"Mom and the baby will be okay,\" she said, looking pointedly at him. His eyes grew wide as he looked at her in shock. \"What…?\" She shook her head and smiled, causing him to narrow his eyes and quirk an eyebrow. \"Did your mom tell you?\" he asked. Grace grinned mysteriously and shrugged her shoulders. \"Hmm…sure,\" she said. Sam shook his head. He would never understand the \"gift\" that his wife and stepdaughter had, but had decided a long time ago that he would just go along with it. \"Have you told your mom that you know?\" he asked, taking another gulp of coffee. She shook her head. He sighed. \"We have had no idea how to tell you two. It's not really a typical conversation—'Okay, we know that you're about ready to graduate from high school, but surprise! You're about to have a baby brother or sister!'\" he said, looking again into his coffee mug. Grace furrowed her brow. \"Sam, are you not happy about this baby?\" Sam looked at her in alarm. \"Oh, I'm thrilled. I've always wanted a big family, and I got that when your mom and I got married. Everyone just welcomed Nick and me into the family with open arms. We definitely don't have the typical family, but it's amazing. One more person makes it that much better,\" he said with a smile. He took a deep breath. Opening up to anyone was not in his nature, but Grace had inherited Cassie's talent of making him spill his guts. \"However…I'm also terrified. I'm not exactly a 'spring chicken'. How can I be a good dad to a brand new kid when I'm old enough to be his or her grandpa?\" he said sardonically. Grace stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him, completely taking him by surprise. When she pulled back, she looked him straight in the eyes. \"Sam, even though he might not always show it, Nick is so lucky to have you as his dad, just as I'm lucky to have you in my life as well, even before you and mom got married. You don't need to be really young to be a good dad, you just have to be someone who will always look out for his kids… and you do. This baby is really lucky, just like the rest of us.\" Sam flushed slightly and smiled. \"Thanks, Grace. Seriously, you are becoming more and more like your mother every day,\" he laughed. She gave him a grin as she walked to the whistling tea kettle. Sam took another sip of his coffee. \"So…how long have you been standing there?\" he asked quietly. Cassie stepped around the corner of the doorway and laughed before wrapping her arms around his middle. \"Long enough to see and hear things that make me love you more, even though I didn't think it was possible.\" She reached up and gave him a soft kiss. \"So, she already knows, huh? I should have figured. She's right, you know…about you. You are an amazing dad, and you will be to this one, too,\" she whispered as she placed her hand on her stomach. He placed his hand on top of hers and smiled. \"I will certainly try my best.\"[Chapter 3] Disclaimer—I still don't own Good Witch, and I still write fluff. There will be time jumps, but I'm just going to write random snippets about the pregnancy/birth/baby/family life. Thank you to all of you who have reviewed. I hope you enjoy, and Merry Christmas! It was Christmas time, and in Middleton, that meant more decorating. While many cities and towns around the world decorated for Christmas, Middleton took it a little further. Stores around town had been preparing for weeks to get their small town in the Christmas spirit. Cassie, however, had been stricken with a bout of morning sickness (which didn't just happen in the morning) every day for the past few weeks. She was already 5 months along and should be past that stage, but it was stubbornly hanging on. They had told everyone in their immediate circle about the baby—obviously Nick and Grace, but also Brandon, Lori, George, and Abigail and they were all excited to welcome a new family member. Even Nick, who they were most worried about, told Sam and Cassie that he had always wanted a little brother or sister, but had always assumed it would never happen. The rest of the town had no idea, and it became increasingly difficult to hide it from them, especially Martha. \"Cassie, you are usually the first one to put up your Christmas decorations! Why don't you have anything up in your shop yet?\" Martha bugged, for what seemed like the millionth time that week. Cassie sighed. She had been feeling sick off and on, but also extremely tired. The thought of decorating her shop was overwhelming at best. \"I promise I'll get to it, Martha. I've just had a lot going on with the shop, and at home,\" Cassie (kind of) lied. \"Well you better!\" Martha huffed, \"A Middleton Christmas is not the same without your shop decorated for the holidays!\" She left in a hurry, leaving Cassie shaking her head. She looked around her at the enormity of the job ahead and sighed again. Suddenly the bell on the door rang and she looked up to see Sam walking in with two paper cups in his hands. He walked up and handed her a cup before kissing her gently. \"How has your day been? Are you feeling any better?\" he asked quietly. Cassie shook her head. \"The tea will help, though, so thanks.\" She replied. He nodded before pulling some crackers out of his bag that he was carrying with him. \"Make sure you eat something, too,\" he told her. Cassie grinned, despite how lousy she was feeling. Typical protective Sam. \"Yes, dad,\" she whispered. He smiled and wrapped his arm around her. \"Was that Martha I saw rushing out of here?\" he asked. \"What is she in such a tizzy about? This time, I mean.\" He smiled into his coffee cup as he took a drink. Cassie shook her head. \"She's just rushing me on the Christmas decorations. Apparently I haven't decorated quickly enough for her taste. I just don't feel up to it right now.\" Sam looked around and finally noticed the lack of Christmas decorations. They had had them up at Grey House for a week or so, but everyone had pitched in to help there. Maybe that was necessary here, too. Cassie leaned against him and closed her eyes, relaxing into his body as he held her. \"Cassie, maybe you should go home,\" Sam said, worried. \"Do you want me to call Tara to cover for you?\" She shook her head. \"I'll be okay. It's not too bad right now,\" she assured him. Sam stayed for another 15 minutes or so before he had to head back to the office. While he was there, he ran into Grace who had continued her internship at his office. \"Grace, do you think you could do something for me?\" Sam asked, while juggling patients' charts. \"Can you round up the family and have them meet at Bell, Book, and Candle tomorrow morning? Your mom has been feeling pretty rough lately, so I want to surprise her and see if we can get the shop decorated so she doesn't have to worry about it anymore. I had Eve shuffle some patients around to give me the morning off and Tara is going to cover for your mom so she can rest at home.\" Grace smiled and nodded before pulling her phone out and sending out a mass text to her entire family. Cassie didn't put up much of a fight the next morning when Sam told her that he'd made arrangements for Tara to cover for her. Sam had called the school and excused Nick and Grace for the day for personal business, so after saying their goodbyes to Cassie (who was curled up on the couch with a book and a cup of tea), they pretended to leave for school. In the house, Sam sat down on the couch and wrapped his arm around his wife, pulling her close. \"I hope you take it easy today,\" he said, gently. \"You take care of everybody all the time, now you need to take care of yourself, and our little guy or girl.\" He placed his hand where his son or daughter was growing, once again marveling at the idea of it. Cassie smiled and squeezed his leg. \"I promise.\" He gave her a quick kiss goodbye and headed for his car, where Nick and Grace were waiting for him. By the time they got to the shop, Tara already had it opened and had retrieved the Christmas decorations from the back of the store. It was Brandon's day off, so he and George were there, beginning to string lights. Abigail joined them an hour or so later when her part-time employee, Sarah, arrived. Together, they made quick work of the decorations, getting help from Tara or Grace whenever they weren't sure what to do. By lunchtime, they were finished. Sam took a step back to admire their work. \"This looks great. Thank you for doing this. This will be a huge relief for Cassie,\" he said. \"I called her a couple of minutes ago and she's feeling a lot better so she's going to be here in a few minutes. I hope you can all stay to surprise her. I've also ordered some food to be brought over from the Bistro for lunch.\" They all grinned and nodded. The food arrived shortly before Cassie did, and by the time she arrived, their small gathering had turned into a party. Stephanie had brought the food over, curious about why everyone was at the shop, and Martha had stopped by to see how decorating was coming along. Pleased to see that her favorite shop in town was now appropriately decorated for the holiday, Martha helped herself to an extra sandwich. Cassie's reaction was priceless. Normally a very calm person, she had tears running down her cheeks as she thanked each of her family members, saving Sam for last. \"I can't believe you all did this for me,\" she said, her face in his neck, as he hugged her to him. \"You're pretty popular around here,\" he quipped with a smirk. She chuckled and brought her face up to meet hers in a sweet kiss. \"No interruptions this time.\" A few minutes later, Stephanie and Martha came up to the couple, demanding to know what was going on. Sam and Cassie looked at each other and Sam shrugged his shoulder. Cassie smiled and reached for Sam's hand. Taking a deep breath she spilled the news and explained why the family was all there. The looks on their faces were priceless, and they hugged Cassie and Sam, congratulating them. \"I'm so sorry I've been so worried about the decorations,\" Martha said, chagrined. \"I had no idea.\" Cassie smiled and put her hand on Martha's shoulder. \"It's okay, really. Look at what everyone did here. I have a pretty amazing family.\" As people trickled out of the store to go on with their day, Cassie hugged each one and thanked them again. Sam was the last one to leave. \"I guess the cat's out of the bag now,\" Sam said. \"Neither Martha nor Stephanie can keep a secret. By this time tomorrow, the whole town will know.\" She laughed and hugged him to her, reveling in his closeness. \"I'm glad. It feels so much more real now,\" she said. \"Now we just need everyone to help decorate the nursery,\" she said with a grin.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer—It's still not mine, I still write fluff, and I'm still on Christmas break (so I have some time to write). J This isn't my best work, but I'm trying to rush through my stories a little bit—I have more to write, and I'm back at work on the third of January. Cassie was now just over 5 months pregnant, and the day of the ultrasound came. She and Sam had discussed finding out whether the baby was a boy or a girl and, no surprise…they disagreed about it. \"Come on, Cassie…it would make it much easier to get ready. We wouldn't have to worry about buying everything in yellow or green,\" Sam argued. Cassie sighed. \"We talked about this, Sam. There are so few surprises left in life, why can't we just wait?\" Sam looked at her dubiously. \"Seriously? No surprises? I think this baby's existence at all is the biggest surprise I've ever had in my life.\" Cassie laughed. \"I guess that's true. I get where you're coming from. How about we decide when we get there? If everything looks good with the baby, we'll discuss it then. And no bribing the ultrasound tech or the doctor!\" Sam grinned. \"No guarantees!\" He dodged to the side as Cassie's hand came up to smack him in the arm. \"Okay, okay…no bribing this time. I promise!\" he said, laughing. Cassie looked at the clock. \"It's time to go,\" she announced. The jovial mood of the room suddenly took a turn as they looked at each other and silently acknowledged the anxieties that they both carried. They both knew the risks associated with an \"advanced maternal age\" pregnancy, and today they would get the first look at their baby to check for potential complications. \"Sam…what if…\" Cassie started. He grabbed her hand. \"I said it once, and I'll say it again…we can handle anything that is thrown our way,\" he assured her. Cassie smiled and squeezed his hand, and led them both outside to the car. When they arrived at the office, a radiologist met them with a handshake and a smile. In a normal pregnancy, ultrasound techs do the ultrasound and send the results to the doctor. This being a special case, and honestly, because of Sam's insistence and his position as chief of staff at Hillcrest, the radiologist would be in the room to review the ultrasound in real time. \"Are you ready?\" she asked. Cassie and Sam each took a deep breath and nodded as they headed into the room. They were both silent as the ultrasound was being set up. As soon as the whoosh whoosh of their baby's heartbeat broke the silence, they both released a breath that they didn't know they were holding. They had heard the baby's heartbeat before, at a routine appointment and through Sam's stethoscope, but to see his or her little heart pumping normally was reassuring. The tech went on, measuring every inch of the baby, checking its heart, brain, and other organs. The radiologist took notes to compare them to normal ranges for development of the baby's gestational age. Sam's doctor brain was on alert as well, looking for anything he could see as an abnormality. Before the tech could move on to measure the baby's legs, she stopped. \"Did you two discuss whether you wanted to find out whether it's a boy or a girl?\" she asked. Sam and Cassie looked at each other. Cassie smiled, \"I don't really like yellow on babies that much. I'd much rather buy pink or blue.\" Sam grinned. \"Are you sure? We don't have to.\" She nodded, both at Sam and the ultrasound tech. \"Are you hoping for one over the other?\" the tech asked as she expertly guided the wand over Cassie's abdomen. Cassie and Sam both shook their heads. \"I have a daughter, and he has a son, along with a stepson and stepdaughter from my first marriage,\" Cassie explained. \"This baby will be a tie-breaker of sorts,\" she said, smiling. The ultrasound tech stopped. \"Last chance to back out,\" she said. They both laughed. As the technician told them the sex of their baby, tears welled in Cassie's eyes. \"Perfect,\" she said, looking at Sam. He grinned at her and squeezed her hand. When the ultrasound finished up, they were assured by the doctor that everything looked completely normal for this stage of pregnancy. Relieved, Cassie and Sam held each other for a moment, as their fears slipped away and the joy came. \"I knew everything would be okay,\" Sam whispered. \"It just had to be.\" When Cassie checked out, the office gave them printed pictures and a dvd of the ultrasound. On a whim, they stopped at the store on the way home and bought two onesies to help announce their news to the family. That afternoon after Nick and Grace were home from school and Abigail from work, the family excitedly crowded into the living room to watch the ultrasound. They had assured everyone that the baby was perfectly healthy, so the atmosphere was that much more joyful. Just before they got to the part where they found out the sex of the baby, Sam stopped the dvd and Cassie handed Nick and Grace each a package. When they unwrapped the boxes and pulled out dark blue and grey onesies that read, \"Little Brother,\" everyone cheered and congratulated them. Even Grace, who had secretly wished for a little sister, was excited. A little boy around the house would be fun, too. \"Any ideas on a name for this handsome little guy yet?\" George asked. Sam and Cassie looked at each other with raised eyebrows. They hadn't even discussed names yet. Given their vast differences, it would be a monumental task to name this baby. But, that was a disagreement for another day.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: Fluffy, fluffy, fluff on the way. If you don't like it, don't read it. It's as simple as that. (4 months later) Cassie woke up in the middle of the night. The pains she had had off and on throughout the day had gotten more frequent and painful, and it was time to wake up Sam. Before she could, a wave of pain hit her and she cried out, biting her lip in an effort to conceal it. This was enough to wake Sam from the deepest sleep. He looked confused for a second before noticing Cassie hunched over next to him. He recognized almost immediately what was going on. \"Oh, Cassie,\" he said as he put his arm around her, \"Why didn't you wake me up? Let's get you to the hospital!\" He hurriedly got out of bed and threw some clothes on. Just as he was grabbing some clothes for her, Cassie was racked with another pain, this time accompanied by her water breaking. Cassie and Sam looked at each other with wide-eyes. \"How many minutes apart?\" he whispered. Cassie just stared at him with fear on her face. \"Not enough,\" she stammered. Sam took a deep breath. \"Cassie, I'm going to check you really quickly. If my instincts are right, we might not make it to the hospital.\" Cassie nodded, but scrunched her face in pain again as another wave hit her. Sam was a professional, but this was his wife and baby. He swallowed his panic in an effort to hide it from her. Both of them needed to remain calm. As he checked on her progress, he noticed that the baby was already crowning. His jaw dropped as he looked at his wife. She knew. \"Okay, Cassie, you're having the baby here. I'm going to go wake up Nick and Grace and have them get some things ready and call 911. Hold steady for a minute. Don't push!\" he ordered as he ran out of the room. He ran down the hall, pounding on doors as he went. Grace was the first one out of her room, followed quickly by Nick, and then George. They all looked at him, alarmed. Sam took a deep breath in an effort to calm himself, \"The baby's coming! Too quickly for the hospital; I'm going to have to deliver him. Nick, get my medical bag, Grace, call 911, and George… get me some clean towels!\" They all ran off to do their duties, as Sam ran back into the bedroom. Cassie was breathing heavily and clutching her abdomen. Sam ran to her side and helped her sit up a bit before positioning himself at the end of the bed. \"Okay, Cassie, the baby's almost here. I need you to push for me.\" Cassie did, and the baby's head descended a little more. Suddenly there was an urgent knock on the door. \"That's right, that's it. You're almost there. Let me just grab my stuff, and we'll be ready for this baby!\" Sam flung open the door and found Nick and George there with his medical bag and the clean towels. \"Thank you!\" With that, he shut the door again and returned to his wife, pulling gloves on as he did. \"Okay, Cassie, one more big push should do it!\" He told her. With extreme effort, Cassie bore down and pushed with all of her might. \"That's it…that's it…the baby's head is out. Hold on for just a second, I need to clear the airway.\" He grabbed the bulb from his medical bag and cleared out the baby's nose and mouth. \"Okay, Cassie, one more gentle push and the baby will be here!\" Cassie was sweating as she gathered the last bit of her strength to push the rest of her baby out. All of a sudden, a wail was heard in the room. Sam looked at Cassie with a grin on his face and held up the baby for her to see. \"Well, it's officially a boy,\" he said, before wrapping the precious baby in one of the towels. Luckily his instruments were already sanitized and ready to go, so he clipped off the umbilical cord and cut it. With that, little baby boy Radford was ready to see his mom. He had calmed down a little, but settled down completely when he was placed in his mother's arms. Sam sat on the edge of the bed next to his wife, watching with a soft smile as she traced a finger around the newborn's face. When she looked up at him, he could see the tears in her eyes. \"He's beautiful,\" she whispered. Sam couldn't agree more. He put his arm around his wife and kissed her softly before returning his attention to his son. The baby yawned before blinking his eyes open. Cassie smiled as she saw two light blue eyes looking up toward her. \"He has your eyes,\" she remarked, \"In fact, he could be your clone.\" Sam looked down at the beautiful baby in her arms. \"He has your chin and ears,\" he said, as he brushed his son's cheek with his finger, \"And hopefully your remarkable spirit and personality.\" He could hear the wail of the ambulance in the distance as he took care of the afterbirth and helped his wife clean up a bit. Luckily, they had been prepared. There was a bassinette, diapers, and baby clothes sitting ready in the corner of their room. He would get his first bath later, but the baby needed to keep warm, so Sam grabbed a diaper and a hat to cover his matted, dark brown hair. When the baby and Cassie were situated, Sam opened the door and called Nick, Grace, and George into the room. They weren't far away. \"You have a new brother and grandson,\" he announced with pride. Grace was the first one in the room, giving Sam a quick hug before sliding past him to go to her mother's side—sitting on Sam's side of the bed and scooting as close as she could to her mom. Nick and George both hugged Sam, before George went down to let the EMTs in. Nick slowly entered the room, trying to get a glimpse of his new baby brother. Sam stood next to his son and put his hand on his shoulder. \"It's okay. Go see him.\" Nick half smiled and looked down at his feet. Cassie looked up, \"Nick. Come see your brother. It's okay.\" Nick walked slowly to the side of the bed and looked down at the baby in his stepmother's arms. \"I told you I always wanted a brother or sister,\" Nick said softly, \"Now I have a lot of them, biological or not. That's thanks to you, you know.\" He told Cassie shyly. Cassie looked up and met Sam's eyes, both smiling. She glanced back at Nick, who was examining his baby brother. \"I'm pretty happy you're here too,\" she told him softly. The next few minutes were a little chaotic as the ambulance arrived and the EMTs strapped Cassie and the baby onto a gurney. Before Sam climbed into the ambulance after his wife and son, he yelled at George, Nick, and Grace to drop off his car at the hospital, and that they would be home as soon as Cassie and the baby were checked out. A couple of hours later, after Cassie and the baby had been given a clean bill of health, they were given the all clear to head home. Luckily, they had installed the car seat the weekend before and had a bag packed and ready to go in the trunk of Sam's car. When Cassie, Sam, and the baby arrived home, they found a banner stretched across the entry way that said, \"Welcome Home Baby Radford!\" They grinned at each other as Sam carried the car seat into the living room, took the baby out, and rocked him gently in his arms. The family gathered around, Cassie seated on the couch, as they formally introduced their new addition. \"Okay, did you two ever decide on a name?\" George asked. Sam glanced at his wife, \"Do you want to tell them?\" he asked as he placed the baby in her arms. \"Everyone, meet William Alexander Radford,\" she said. \"William after Sam and his dad, Alexander after mine. We'll call him Will.\" The baby opened his eyes and blinked sleepily, seemingly ready to meet everyone. They passed him around to each family member, Grace being the first to hold him. She took the little cap off his head and ran her fingers through his now-clean hair. \"His hair is so soft,\" she said. \"It's kind of like a mix between both of yours—not as light as Sam's and not as dark as Mom's. His eyes are all Sam, though.\" Nick was a little more nervous to hold the baby, but soon relaxed as his baby brother snuggled into his arms. \"He seems pretty chill, though. Much more like Cassie than Dad,\" he teased. They all laughed quietly and watched as baby Will blinked up at Nick, completely at ease with so many people surrounding him. Even Brandon and Tara got to hold their new little \"brother\". By the time he got back to his parents, Will had fallen back to sleep. Cassie looked down at her little boy snuggled in her arms and smiled. He was absolutely beautiful, and she could sense an amazing spirit coming from him. She glanced at Sam, who had also been watching their son, and they smiled at each other. This would be an interesting ride, but one they would be on together, and she couldn't imagine it any other way.[Chapter 6] I am going to keep this as an open-ended story. While I won't be posting as often once school starts again, I feel like there are a myriad of stories that could be told with these characters. They will likely be short, as I prefer to write single topic stories, but I'll try to update as often as I can. Also, thank you to everyone who has reviewed. To be honest, I write these for myself, but have decided to post them in hopes that other people will start to post some of their own stories. Sam was pulled from the depths of sleep by a shrill wail coming from the end of the bed. His sleep deprived brain took a few seconds longer than usual to realize what was going on, and he was reminded again that life with a newborn is not for the weak. Glancing beside him, he realized that Cassie hadn't even stirred. She had been taking most of the night feedings lately and was absolutely exhausted. Slipping out of bed, he quickly walked to his 3 month old son's bassinet and lifted him to his shoulder to calm him. His normally quiet and easy-going son was very vocal when he was hungry or needed to be changed, so it wasn't too hard to guess what he needed. Quietly exiting the room, he carried Will to the kitchen to warm up a bottle. While it was heating, he expertly changed the baby's diaper and swaddled him up again, nice and snug. It calmed him down a bit, but he was still whimpering with hunger. When the bottle was ready, Sam proceeded to the living room to feed his son. \"Mmm…that's good, huh?\" he asked Will, who was sucking down his bottle. He yawned. \"You need to start sleeping through the night, little guy. You're wearing everyone out.\" Will gurgled as he continued eating. Sam started talking to his son about whatever he could think of, eventually describing the process of diagnosing various ailments and describing different bones in the body. The whole time he was talking, Will was staring up into his face, seemingly riveted by what Sam had to say. He was an unusually focused baby and he loved it when people talked to him. When Will was finished eating and had been burped, Sam lay down on the couch and placed his son in the crook of his arm in hopes that cuddling would help him fall back asleep. That is exactly what Cassie found 30 minutes later when she woke up and realized that both her husband and son were missing. After searching the usual places…the nursery (they used the rocker in there sometimes) and kitchen, she found Sam fast asleep on the couch, feet hanging off the edge, with a sleeping Will snuggled up to him. The sight made her smile and she quickly grabbed her phone and took a picture. The sound woke Sam from his light sleep and he quickly glanced down at Will to make sure he was okay. \"I was wondering where my men were,\" Cassie said, startling Sam in the process. \"I woke up and found myself alone for the first time in…a while,\" she continued. She walked toward them and gently picked the sleeping baby out of Sam's arms. He didn't stir. \"Boy, when he's asleep, he's really asleep,\" she said, chuckling. \"Remind you of anyone?\" Sam narrowed his eyes playfully. She had been teasing him since they got married about how hard he was to wake up, but even more so since Will was born. That was one of the main reasons why Cassie took most of the night feedings. \"Yeah, well, he also 'talks' in his sleep…I wonder if I know anyone else that does that?\" he said jokingly. Cassie grinned. \"Well, it's almost time to move him out of our room and into his nursery, anyway. Then you'll only have to sleep through one person talking to you instead of two,\" she said with a laugh. Sam laughed quietly and rose from the couch slowly, stretching his limbs as he did. \"Into the nursery, huh? That's a big step for him… and for us,\" Sam said with a glint in his eye. Cassie grinned, looking behind her as she started up the stairs. \"Maybe we can give it a test run tonight. Everything is set up and ready to go, and he's dry and full.\" Sam's eyebrows shot up and he hurried up the stairs behind her. After Cassie placed Will in the crib and turned on the baby monitor, she stepped back into Sam's arms. They stood there for a few minutes, just watching their son's even breathing before Cassie leaned back and kissed Sam softly. \"I still can't believe he's ours,\" she said, amazed. Sam nodded in agreement. \"I know. I don't know how we got so lucky,\" he said. Cassie turned in his arms and kissed him again, before taking his hand and pulling him out of the nursery and into their room next door. Will slept soundly in his new crib for the rest of the night, giving his parents some much needed alone time together.[Chapter 7] Sam opened the door quietly, slipped into the dark house, and silently made his way up the stairs. He came to the nursery door and hesitated before entering, torn between wanting to see his son and not wanting to wake him up. An inspection of the crib found the one-year old boy to be sleeping soundly, so Sam ran his hand over Will's head before dragging his fingers through his own hair in exhaustion. He had been so busy running the clinic and being chief of staff at Hillcrest, that it felt like it had been ages since he'd spent any time with his family. Quietly shutting the nursery door, he finally entered his and Cassie's bedroom. Through the darkness he could see Cassie's form curled up on her side of the bed and he sighed. It had been an exhausting day. He had just gotten home from a long day at the office when he had gotten an emergency call from the hospital. Cassie had been feeding Will at the time, and he was getting food all over himself, Cassie, and the high chair. She smiled, as usual, but he had seen the strain on her face as he kissed her goodbye…again. These long hours were becoming more and more frequent, and something had to give. He was missing out on the most important moments in his son's life…again. The bed looked awfully inviting, but he walked past it to the bathroom first. Looking into the mirror, he noticed the haggard man looking back at him. He looked wore down and weary. Walking into the bedroom and slowly undressing, he slipped under the covers and reached for his wife. She stirred and turned to face him. \"Long night,\" she said groggily. Sam rubbed his face, \"Long day, too.\" She searched his face for a clue about what he was thinking. \"Cassie…\" he started. She looked at him expectantly. \"I can't do this anymore.\" Her face was the picture of confusion, and he sighed. \"When I took the Chief of Staff job at the hospital, I knew it would be hard. I knew there would be long days and nights. What I didn't know is how much it would keep me away from my family. I was single then, Nick was practically grown, Will obviously didn't exist, and it was an exciting challenge.\" Cassie raised her eyebrow. \"What are you saying, Sam?\" He ran his hands through his hair. \"Well, I've been thinking about it, and I think I want to resign as chief of staff. I have enough going on with my practice and here. I don't want to feel like I'm missing out on anything. I have too many things pulling me toward home.\" Cassie eyed him. \"And you're happy with that decision?\" Sam cracked a smile, remembering when he asked that same thing of Cassie when she decided not to go to the Maldives. \"Yeah. The chief of staff job is…tempting , but…\" \"Home,\" Cassie cut in. \"Even more so. \" He finished. She smiled back and reached for him. \"Well, I'll try to make your decision to stay worthwhile.\" She kissed him softly and he grinned before whispering, \"Yeah, you better.\" He kissed her again before pulling her close and snuggling into his pillow, falling asleep almost immediately. The next morning, he woke up before Cassie for a change. He leaned over and kissed her shoulder before snuggling up closer and wrapping his arm around her. Her arm came up and she laced her fingers with his before turning over to face him. \"Good morning,\" she whispered before giving him a soft kiss. \"Every morning I wake up with you in my arms is a good morning,\" he replied. \"Are you really okay with your decision to resign? I don't want you to feel pressured into doing anything,\" Cassie told him. Sam gently traced patterns up and down her arm and gave her a soft smile. \"You, Will, Nick, and Grace are more important to me than any job. I have hardly seen any of you at all in the last couple of months and I'm not okay with that.\" Cassie smiled and kissed him again, enjoying the peaceful moment until they heard high pitched squeals and singing coming from the baby monitor. They glanced over at the monitor and began laughing. Cassie started to get out of bed, but Sam put his hand on her shoulder, stopping her. \"I'll get him,\" he offered as he pulled the covers back and slowly got up. Cassie stretched and snuggled back into her pillow before hearing, \"Dadadada!\" through the monitor. She smiled as she heard the excitement in her son's voice. Even more endearing was the excitement in Sam's voice as he began talking to Will. \"Hey, buddy! Daddy's missed you. Have you been a good boy for Mama?\" She could hear Will's attempted response, and then shrieks and giggles. Sam's deep laugh joined in the mix. She closed her eyes and smiled, listening to the sounds of her husband and son playing together, when suddenly, the sounds stopped. She turned towards the door just in time to see Sam bounding through it with Will stretched out in his arms, flying around the room like an airplane. The giggles echoed off the walls and Cassie couldn't help but start laughing herself. When Sam finally placed the boy in the middle of the bed, the joy on both of their faces was shining through. \"Mama!\" Will cried, before jumping on her. She chuckled and snuggled her son up to her, all the while watching Sam. He was still grinning from ear to ear, and he seemed 50 pounds lighter. His countenance had brightened, and he seemed…happier. This would be a good change for them, she thought. He caught her eye and smiled. \"My decision is already worthwhile,\" he said softly, before pulling his wife and son into his arms.[Chapter 8] After writing this chapter, I realized that it had even more fluff in in than usual. Proceed with caution. The inspiration for this chapter comes from my own experiences with my nieces and nephews, particularly when they were younger. When someone showed them a little extra attention, they kind of became obsessed with that person and wanted to spend every moment with them. I can imagine that if Will were real that he would get A LOT of attention, not just from his family, but from the entire town. I also like to tie in things that were said in the actual show. The episode referenced in this chapter is Somewhat Surprising from Season 3. \"Will! Get back here!\" Cassie yelled after her 2 year old son as he ran streaking down the hall from the bathroom. He had managed to escape her grasp as she was trying to dry him off from his bath, so he was a very naked little toddler. \"Mama can't catch me!\" he giggled as he darted from side to side. Nick, who was home from college for the holidays, happened to be walking down the hallway and caught his little brother by the arms and held onto him until Cassie could wrap the towel around his squirming body and pick him up. She smiled gratefully at Nick. \"This reminds me of that story that your dad told about you running around the house after your grandma would give you a bath. Do you remember that? That day we were looking at all the pictures?\" she laughed. Nick chuckled. \"Yeah, I remember that. Now this little rascal is keeping it in the family,\" he said, reaching out and tickling Will, who giggled and again tried to squirm out of his mother's arms. He then flung himself forward toward Nick, reaching his arms out. \"Nicky…hold me!\" the little boy said as Cassie struggled to keep her grip on him. Nick reached out and took Will out of Cassie's embrace. As soon as he got what he wanted, Will was calm and gave Nick a huge grin. \"Nicky my favorite brudder,\" he said as he put his head on his shoulder. Cassie laughed. \"Will, we need to get you dressed,\" she said as she reached back for him. Will shook his head back and forth. \"No. Nicky!\" Nick laughed and looked between his brother and stepmother. \"If you give me his clothes, I'll get him dressed if you want,\" he offered. Cassie smiled at him gratefully. \"Thank you, Nick. You're a wonderful big brother.\" She gently poked Will's belly with her finger. \"You be good for your brother, mister. I'll be right back with your clothes.\" Will giggled again. Nick grinned at the little boy in his arms, just as Grace came up the stairs. Seeing Nick holding a towel-clad Will, she raised an eyebrow and chuckled. \"Did he run off after his bath again?\" she asked, laughing. Nick laughed and nodded. \"Gra-Gra!\" Will yelled, leaning out toward her. Nick passed him off. \"It seems I'm no longer the favorite here,\" Nick said with a smile. Will looked back and forth between Nick and Grace. \"Nicky favorite brudder, Gra-Gra favorite sissy.\" They were still laughing when Cassie came back with Will's clothes. \"So now you've attached yourself to Grace, have you? Who do you want to help get you dressed?\" Cassie asked, laughing. Will thought hard for a few seconds. \"Nicky AND Gra-Gra!\" Later that night, when everyone was home, Cassie told Sam what happened. He laughed. \"How fitting that Nick was the one to catch him this time,\" he said, glancing at his older son. Will, knowing they were talking about him, grinned and jumped into his father's arms. \"Daddy, Mama gave me a bath today. Nicky and Gra-Gra helped.\" Sam tousled his son's hair. \"I heard that, Will. Why did you run away from your mama?\" he asked. Will grinned. \"Me and Mama play games. I fast!\" he said proudly. The whole room burst out into laughter, including Will, who seemed surprised and pleased to have made everyone laugh. He leaned over and reached out to his mom, so Sam passed him over to Cassie and put his arm around her. \"He fast!\" Sam repeated with a grin. Cassie laughed and snuggled the little boy close to her as he laid his head on her shoulder. \"He does love to run,\" she said with a smile. Will pulled his head up and looked at her, putting his hand on her cheek. \"Fun game, Mama. You fast, too.\" Nick watched this exchange with a smile on his face. He loved his mom, but he had serious doubts that she was as loving and calm with him as a little boy as Cassie was with Will. That boy won the lottery, he thought. Will had put his head back on Cassie's shoulder and was dropping off to sleep as she rubbed his back. \"Come on, baby, let's go get you in your pjs and I'll tuck you in,\" she said softly as she moved toward the stairs. Will shook his head and yawned. \"No. I want Mama, Daddy, Nicky, AND Gra-Gra to tuck me in.\" She looked over at the other occupants of the room and they all grinned and joined her in climbing the stairs. After getting him changed into his pajamas and tucked into bed, each person leaned down to say goodnight and give him a kiss on the cheek or head. Nick and Grace left the room first, heading off to hang out with friends while Nick was in town. Sam and Cassie stood watching their son as he drifted off to sleep with a smile on his face. He had been surrounded by the people he loved most, and he couldn't be happier. \"He sure loves his brother and sister,\" Cassie whispered. \"He's been attached to them even more than usual today.\" Sam pulled her close. \"We have some pretty amazing kids. And this one is getting kind of spoiled with all of the attention,\" he said with a soft chuckle, nodding toward Will. Cassie smiled and nodded. \"He is a little spoiled, but he's spoiled with love from everyone he knows. I can't imagine anything better.\"[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: It's still not mine, but I do enjoy \"borrowing\" the characters for a little bit. I also jumped around (perspective wise) in this chapter. I made up information about the Merriwick line, but…this is all made up, so I hope it doesn't matter to anyone. Happy reading. Cassie was just falling asleep when she heard the door creak open. \"Mama? Daddy? Can I sleep in here with you?\" the frightened voice of her three-year old asked. She sat up and glanced toward the door. \"What's wrong honey?\" Will ran to his mother's side and pulled back the covers, sliding in. Crawling over her to lay in between his parents, he snuggled up to Cassie and held on tight. \"I had a bad dream,\" he said in a quiet voice. Sam stirred and blinked groggily. \"Will? What's going on?\" he asked, looking between his son and Cassie. Will launched himself at his dad and held on for dear life, his tears wetting the front of Sam's shirt. Sam's arm automatically went around his son and his eyebrow quirked as he looked at Cassie. What's going on? He mouthed. She half shrugged and frowned. Concerned, Cassie rubbed the boy's back and gently tugged on his shoulder to pry him away from Sam so he would look at her. \"What was your bad dream about, baby?\" Will sniffed and wiped his face with his hand. \"It was tomorrow and Daddy and Gra-Gra got hurt in the car.\" Cassie's eyes went wide. Sam was taking Grace to Chicago in the morning to meet with one of his former colleagues that was doing work with gene therapy. Grace, who was fascinated with the subject and was trying to decide what Master's or PhD program to apply for once she finished her Bachelor's degree, had been enthusiastic when Sam offered to set up the meeting. Cassie had been excited for her daughter…until now. With Will being one of the few boys born on the Merriwick line, she was unsure of whether or not her son had inherited her gift. While it was assumed that it was passed from mother to daughter, that hypothesis was largely untested. Was this a typical nightmare or a premonition of things to come? She looked at Sam who shrugged in response. Cassie held her boy to her and furrowed her brow. She hadn't known that Jake was in trouble until after he was killed. Was it possible that something was going to happen to Sam and Grace and she couldn't feel it? Will looked up at her with tear-filled eyes. \"Mama? Are Daddy and Gra-Gra going to be okay?\" Cassie smiled, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. \"Of course, honey. It was just a bad dream. Go back to sleep. You can sleep in here with us tonight if you want.\" Having gotten the reassurance that he needed, Will quickly nodded off to sleep between his parents, one hand on each of them. Seeing the concerned look on his wife's face, Sam reached out and cupped her cheek with his hand. \"Hey…it's okay. It was just a bad dream. He just heard us talking about it tonight at dinner. Plus, I'm the world's best driver!\" he cracked, attempting to make her smile. Cassie gave him a half smile. \"I wish I knew that for sure,\" she whispered, looking down at Will. Sam leaned over Will and gave her a quick kiss. \"I promise we'll be careful,\" he said. Cassie nodded and wrapped her arm around Sam with Will in between them, holding them both as closely as she could. The next morning before they left, Sam reassured Cassie once more that everything would be okay. \"I know we'll be driving a lot today, but I promise that I will call you when we get there and when we leave. Would you rather us stay there tonight and come back tomorrow morning? I have patients tomorrow, but I will have Eve push them back if you want.\" Cassie shook her head. \"Just go and come back. I want you back here tonight so I can stop worrying about it.\" Sam nodded and kissed her goodbye before turning to Will and hugging him gently. \"It'll be okay, buddy. I'll be home in time to help tuck you in tonight, okay?\" Will nodded and returned to his breakfast. He was very trusting, so if his daddy told him it would be okay, it would be. \"Bye, Daddy. Bye Gra-Gra,\" he said through a mouthful of pancakes. Grace gave her mom a quick hug goodbye before following Sam out to the car. \"It was just a dream, right?\" she asked Sam as they were getting in the car. \"What Will saw?\" Sam gave her a smile and started the car. \"Absolutely. We'll be just fine.\" The day went by slowly for Cassie. Sam had called to let her know that they'd gotten to Chicago okay and that he would call her again before they left in a couple of hours. She was able to breathe easier knowing that they'd made it, but there was still a 3-hour drive back. She and Will were spending most of the day at the store where she was working on new ordering. After Will was born, she had converted a small storage room in the back into a playroom/office, so she was able to get some work done while Will played. Today, however, her thoughts were elsewhere. She looked up from her paperwork to see Will playing with his toy airplane. \"Hey, Will, come here for a minute,\" she called. Will walked over to his mom, still flying his plane in the air. He looked up at her questioningly. \"Mama? You okay?\" Cassie picked him up and placed him in her lap. \"You're such a sweet boy. Yes, I'm okay. I have to ask you a question, though. Honey, have you ever felt anything…funny before? Have you had a feeling that something would happen and then it did?\" Will tilted his head. \"Funny? I feel funny when people tickle me,\" he said, confused. Cassie smiled. He was obviously a little too young for this conversation. Either that or he didn't have \"the gift\". Time would tell. For now, she would have to wait patiently for Sam and Grace to return home and she would stop worrying about it for a while. Half-way through her stack of paperwork, Sam called to tell her that they were on the way home. After working for another hour, sensing that both she and Will needed a distraction, she gathered him up and headed to the Bistro for some tea and a visit. Stephanie made her usual fuss over Will, showering him with hugs, kisses, and way too many sweets, while Cassie sipped her tea and had a chat with her old friend. \"So, Sam and Grace are in Chicago today, huh? She came in yesterday for lunch and told me the news. She seemed pretty excited about it,\" Stephanie said, while placing another chocolate croissant in front of Will. Cassie raised an eyebrow at the second croissant, but didn't say anything. Instead, she sighed. \"They are. They should be home in a couple of hours.\" Stephanie looked at her, concerned. \"What's wrong?\" Cassie didn't know what to say. She couldn't really talk about why she was concerned—she wasn't sure whether Will had just had a bad dream or if he had had a premonition. Just as she was about to answer, her phone rang. Seeing Grace's name on her phone, she quickly answered it. \"Grace, is everything okay?\" she asked quickly. Grace's reply nearly stopped her heart. \"Mom, there's been an accident….\" **To be continued… (I have Monday off, so I'll try to post again then)[Chapter 10] Part 2- \"Grace, is everything okay?\" she asked quickly. Grace's reply nearly stopped her heart. \"Mom, there's been an accident….\" Cassie opened her mouth to say something, but was cut off by static. \"Accident…highway…Sam…\" \"Grace? Grace? You're cutting out. Are you okay?\" Cassie's voice rose in pitch as she walked around the Bistro in hopes of getting a better signal. Her stomach twisted as she tried to understand what was happening. \"I'm okay…but Sam…Mom …hear me? Sam…call…\" Cassie stepped out of the Bistro in a panic. \"Grace? I can't hear you. What about an accident and Sam?\" she said desperately. This time, the voice on the other end was crystal clear. \"There's been an accident on the highway. Sam wanted me to call and let you know we would be a little late so you wouldn't worry.\" Cassie's whole body sagged with relief. \"Are you two okay?\" she asked. \"We're good. We're just passing the accident now…it doesn't look good. The traffic looks like it's clearing up past the accident, so we should be home in about 2.5 hours,\" Grace responded. Cassie thanked her daughter for calling before ending the call and stepping back inside the Bistro. Stephanie and Will were both looking at her, alarmed. \"Everything's fine,\" she said, \"there was an accident on the highway, so they're going to be about half an hour later than expected.\" She sat down and put her head in her hands. Will reached over and patted her arm. \"Mama? Daddy and Gra-Gra are okay?\" She looked over at her son and gave him a smile, pulling him onto her lap. \"Yes, honey. They're okay. Let's go home and make them some yummy dinner and dessert. You can help.\" His blue eyes lit up and sparkled. \"Cake?\" Cassie laughed and nodded. \"If that's what you want. We'll make Grace's favorite chocolate cake.\" She and Will said their goodbyes to Stephanie and headed home. When Sam and Grace walked into the house a couple of hours later, the smells wafting from the kitchen drew them in. Will was the first to notice them. \"Daddy! Gra-Gra!\" he shouted as he ran toward them. Sam picked him up as he got closer and swung him around before hugging him close. Cassie gave Grace a long hug before turning to Sam and giving him a kiss, with Will squished between them. \"I wasn't sure…\" she started, relief evident in her voice. \"I know,\" he said. \"We're home, though. Safe and sound. \" Will was reaching for Grace, so Sam passed him over and held his wife close. \"Gra-Gra…Mama made cake. I helped!\" he told his sister excitedly. Grace laughed and tickled him. \"Oh, yeah? Did you eat it all without us?\" she asked, wiping at the frosting smeared on his cheek. \"No, Mama wouldn't let me,\" he said with a little frown. \"I helped with the frosting.\" Grace continued her conversation with her little brother, attempting to give her mom and Sam a minute alone. She knew that her mom had been worried, but especially after the phone call. While her mom hadn't heard her, Grace had heard every word that her mom said, and could hear the panic in her voice. She couldn't imagine what her mom was thinking. Since Grace was the one who had called, she was obviously okay, but her mom had already lost one husband; the thought of losing Sam, too, would have been unbearable. Seeing her mom and Sam smiling now, she knew that he had made her feel better about it. That was one of the things that she appreciated about Sam. He was unfailingly loyal and always seemed to know exactly what her mom needed to hear. Her mom did the same for him. No matter how different they were, they were great for each other. Cassie finally stepped out of Sam's embrace and walked toward the food on the stove. \"I hope you're hungry. I made your favorites… Chicken Alfredo for Sam and chocolate cake for you,\" she said, looking at Grace and glancing at the lumpy- looking cake. \"Will helped frost it,\" she said with a laugh. As they sat down for dinner, Cassie asked how the meeting had gone. Grace glanced at Sam, who gave her an encouraging smile, and then looked back at her mom. \"Great! He offered me an internship. It's an incredible opportunity, so I've decided to apply for the program at Northwestern in the fall,\" Grace explained. Cassie smiled. She was happy for her daughter, but it was bittersweet. She had enjoyed having Grace continue to live at home while she worked on a Bachelor's Degree, but knew the day would come that she would have to move on. \"That's great, honey. Congratulations. I'm proud of you!\" After dinner, dessert, a quick bath for Will (who had managed to get chocolate cake all over himself), and putting him to bed for the night, Cassie and Sam finally found themselves alone. Sam poured some wine and they sat closely on the couch. \"So…how well do you know this doctor that Grace is going to internship with?\" she asked casually. Sam raised an eyebrow and looked at her incredulously. \"Cassie…he's one of the best in his field. He's also one of the best people I know. He and his wife are raising 3 kids; the oldest is also a student at Northwestern,\" Sam replied. Cassie held up her hands in surrender. \"Okay, okay. You can't blame me for wondering. Especially since Grace is going to be working so closely with him,\" she said with a sigh. Sam wrapped his arm around her. \"I know this is hard for you. In fact, it's hard for me, too. But you have to know that I'd never do anything to hurt Grace, that includes introducing her to people I didn't deem worthy,\" he said. He took a deep breath. \"Honestly, when we were at Will's ultrasound, I was secretly hoping for a girl. While I wouldn't trade Will for anything in the world, I've always wanted a daughter. I'll never have one of my own, but Grace comes awfully close.\" Cassie smiled softly at him, amazed at how lucky she was. Sam had been wonderful with Grace ever since he and Nick had moved to Middleton. He taught her how to drive, listened to her complain about boys, and even helped her with her homework. The love that he showed for her daughter made Cassie love him even more. She gave him a lingering kiss. When they pulled back for air, he looked at her questioningly. \"That's for loving Grace like your own,\" she said before kissing him again. \"And that's for the amazing father you are to Will and Nick.\" \"And this…this is because I like you a little bit,\" she whispered and winked as she pulled him into a tight embrace, kissing him passionately. By the time they pulled away, the air around them felt charged with electricity. She stood, reached for his hand, and led him upstairs. They both hoped that there would be no nightmares tonight.[Chapter 11] Fluffy, fluffy, fluff, fluff. :) It was \"bring your son to work day\" for Sam. Cassie was out of town for the afternoon picking up items for her store and she couldn't bring Will with her. This wasn't the first time Sam had brought Will to the office, but a doctor's office is not very baby/toddler/preschooler friendly, so it didn't happen very often. Usually he just came to the office when Cassie stopped by, or for an occasional hour or two while she needed to get some things done, sans her precocious 4 year old. Preschool had been cancelled that day due to the teacher's illness (one of Sam's patients, in fact), so Will would be at the office all afternoon. \"Okay, Will,\" his mom said as she dropped him off, \"remember that you need to be on your best behavior. Some people are sick and they're here so Daddy can help them. You can't be running around. If Daddy's in a room with the door closed, you can't go in there. You need to wait until he comes back out.\" Will nodded and gave his mom a hug. Cassie kissed the top of his head before giving Sam a proper kiss goodbye. \"I love you. I'll be back as soon as I can.\" The first part of the afternoon went slowly for Will. His dad had a lot of work to do and Eve was busy, too. He quickly got bored playing with the toys in the waiting area and began to wander around the office, looking for something to do. Sam was with a patient and Eve had gotten a call, so he was able to sneak back to one of the free exam rooms. He found one of his dad's lab coats and put it on, letting it trail back behind him on the ground. Then, sneaking carefully past Eve's desk, he entered the room he had seen his dad go into. \"Well, Mrs. Jacobs, it looks like you're doing well. I…\" Sam stopped as he saw his son enter the room. \"Will, what are you…?\" he started before taking in the whole picture in front of him. He grinned and picked Will up. \"Excuse me, Mrs. Jacobs. I hope you don't mind, but I've called in a consult for you. This is Dr. William Radford.\" Will giggled. \"Daddy! Mrs. Jacobs knows me! She's Mama's friend!\" Mrs. Jacobs smiled at the scene in front of her, father and son in matching lab coats with identical grins plastered on their faces. She walked up to Will and tickled him. \"What a handsome new doctor you have here, Dr. Radford,\" she said, looking at Sam and then back at Will. \"Adorable.\" She straightened \"his\" lab coat and grinned as she walked out of the room. Sam put Will down on the chair and looked him in the eyes. \"Buddy…I love your doctor look, but remember what Mama said about coming into the room when there was a patient in here?\" he said gently. Will looked down. \"I'm sorry, Daddy. I just wanted to show you!\" Sam smiled and scooped his son back into his arms. \"You look like the real deal! We'll have to get you your own little lab coat. Would you like that?\" Will's eyes lit up. \"Really?\" Sam laughed. \"Sure, why not. But, if you're going to be a doctor, you need to dress the part even more. He went to his closet where he kept some extra clothes, just in case, and took out an old tie. He slung it around Will's neck and tied it, tucking it under the collar of his dark blue shirt. Sam then rifled through the drawers of his desk until he could find an old stethoscope that he put around his son's neck. The stethoscope hung close to his waist and the tie went almost to his knees, but Will didn't care. He was thrilled. \"Look, Daddy! We match!\" Just then, Eve came running into the room. \"I'm so sorry, Dr. Radford. I had a phone call…\" She trailed off when she realized what she was seeing. Grinning broadly, she addressed Will. \"Dr. Radford…Mr. Richards called to cancel his appointment. He rescheduled for next week.\" Will grinned and looked at his dad, then back at Eve. \"Eve…it's me…Will!\" he said, waving. Eve blinked, as if coming out of a trance. \"Will? But…what about Dr. Radford? Where is he?\" \"Daddy's right here, silly!\" he said, poking Sam in the chest. \"But I'm going to be a doctor just like him,\" he said with a grin. Sam swelled with pride. Nick had never shown any interest in what he did. Even as a young boy when his mother would bring him to the hospital, he was more interested in the toys in the waiting room than he was with the hospital. While he was immensely proud of Nick and his accomplishments, he was thrilled that one of his sons was showing an interest in his life's work. Granted, a four year old shows interest in almost everything, but still… The rest of the day passed by smoothly, with Will keeping his doctor's garb on the whole afternoon. After the last patient had left, when Sam was busy filling out some charts at the front desk, the door opened and Cassie entered. \"Mama!\" Will yelled, as he ran to her. Cassie was surprised, but smiled widely when she saw Will running toward her in his \"doctor outfit.\" She picked him up and hugged him close to her. \"Well, Dr. Radford. You are the cutest doctor I've ever seen!\" she said. Sam had looked up from his paperwork as soon as Cassie had walked in. \"Hey! I'm offended,\" he said with a smirk. \"Sorry. Tied for cutest,\" she said, smiling, before walking over and giving him a kiss hello. \"Mama! Daddy told me I could be a doctor when I grow up. I looked at a big book with bones in it and he told me some names! He even showed me how to use his…skefasope.\" He grinned, taking the stethoscope from around his neck and showing her. \"Really? What do you do with it?\" she asked. Will put the ear pieces in his ears and held the metal end to his mom's chest. He listened for a few seconds before smiling broadly. \"Mama, your heart is loud!\" Cassie and Sam laughed. \"That's because my heart is happy. I have you, your daddy, Grace, Nick, Brandon, and Lori. It is very happy.\" Cassie said as she kissed his cheek and hugged him tightly. Will put the stethoscope to his own chest. \"My heart is loud, too…and happy!\" he exclaimed. Sam and Cassie smiled at each other and she kissed his cheek once more before setting him down. \"Okay, Dr. Radford. Time to take all of this doctor stuff off so we can head home,\" Cassie told her son. Will removed the lab coat with a slight pout on his face. Sam removed the tie, but returned the stethoscope to around his son's neck. Will's face lit up. \"I can keep it?\" Will asked with delight. Sam smiled and nodded, taking his hand and leading him to the front where Cassie was waiting. She took Will's other hand, and they walked out into the cool evening air together. Will squeezed his parents' hands. \"You have big metacarpals,\" he said with a grin. Cassie and Sam looked at each other shocked, eyebrows raised. Their son was definitely a precocious 4 year old.[Chapter 12] -Thank you to everyone who has reviewed this story. I appreciate you taking the time to let me know what you think. It took me a while to decide what I wanted to write about for Will's 5 th year, but I decided to play the school card (I AM a teacher, after all). I have a gifted nephew whom I have patterned Will after in this particular chapter. - April 29 th is getting closer and closer! I'm excited to see where our favorite characters go (hopefully down the aisle )! Enjoy! Cassie stood outside of Middleton Elementary School awaiting Sam's arrival. She had received a call from Will's kindergarten teacher asking for a meeting that afternoon. She had called Sam, who was able to rearrange some appointments, but who was running a little late. Suddenly, his car pulled up and he jumped out, jogging over to her. He gave her a quick kiss in greeting. \"Hey, sorry I'm late. My last appointment ran a little long.\" Cassie smiled and took his hand, walking toward the building. Sam looked over at her. \"Any idea what this is about? Is he in trouble?\" he asked. Cassie shook her head. \"She said he's not in trouble, just that she wanted to meet with us as soon as possible. She said she would explain more when we met.\" Sam nodded and held the door open for Cassie to pass through before following her inside. School was over for the day so it was pretty quiet. Will's teacher, Ms. Brown, asked to meet with them without Will, so Cassie had arranged for George to watch him for a little while that afternoon. Making their way down the hallway to the kindergarten classrooms, Cassie smiled at the work that was displayed on the walls. The students had written a single short sentence about their families and had drawn pictures above. One boy named Jack had written, \"Mi famale is fun.\" The crooked writing and stick figures made her smile wider. When she spotted Will's name, she stopped. He had drawn a cute picture of their family—Cassie, Sam, Nick, Grace—and included Lori, Brandon, Tara, George, and Abigail. What really caught her attention was under the picture. He had written, \"My family is the best! My moms nam is Cassie and my dads name is Sam. They love me a lot. My mom is amasing. We like to go on woks and make cookees. My dad is awsum! He teeches me a lot about being a docter and he is teeching me how to play baskitball. I have one brother named Nick. He is funy and he maks me laf. I have one sister. Her name is Grase. She is one of my favrit peple. We like to play games and bild forts in my room. Grandpa George lives with us. He is the best grandpa ever. Brandon Tara and Lori are my extra family. They are grat. Abigail is my moms cusin. She tikles me a lot. I love my family!\" Cassie looked over at Sam, who had also been reading Will's work. He was glancing back and forth between Will's paper and the other kids', eyebrows raised. He finally looked at her with a smirk on his face. \"Well, I think I know why she wants to meet with us,\" he said with a chuckle. They entered the classroom and greeted Ms. Brown, whom they had just met a month or so before when Will had first started school. She directed them toward some chairs that she had set up for them right by her desk. \"Ms. Nightingale, Dr. Radford, thank you for coming in today. I know it was short notice, but I feel like the sooner we get this process taken care of, the better.\" Cassie and Sam looked at each other, confused. \"Sorry, what process?\" Sam asked. Ms. Brown smiled. \"As you know, Will is an exceptionally brilliant child. He is already reading on a third grade level, and his writing and math skills are far beyond the beginning of kindergarten. I have spoken to the principal, counselor, and other teachers and I wanted to ask you for permission to have him tested. I also want to talk to you about the possibility of having him promoted to first grade, effective as soon as possible.\" Cassie and Sam looked at each other. Of course they had known that their son was smart, but they didn't know just how far above his peers he truly was. \"He hasn't mentioned anything to us about being bored in class. He has mostly talked about the friends he has made. I want to talk to him to see if he would even want to move up. I don't want him to have to leave his friends if he doesn't want to,\" Cassie said. Sam nodded in agreement. Ms. Brown smiled. She liked these two. \"Absolutely. That was one of the reasons why I wanted to get this process started soon. If he DOES move up to first grade, the beginning of the school year is the best time to do it. It would be an easier transition for him.\" Cassie and Sam spoke to the teacher for a little while longer and signed the paperwork agreeing to have their son tested. As they were leaving, Ms. Brown shook their hands. \"Thank you for coming in today. We will have our School Psychologist test him this week, and we will call you with the results. Those results will determine if he should move up to first grade. In the meantime, why don't you go home and talk to him about it. See what he thinks, and we will chat later.\" On the way to their cars, Sam stopped. Cassie glanced back at him with a questioning look. He bit his lip, and his forehead was creased, \"If we do this, he'll go off to college a year earlier. He'll only be 17. We have to think about that.\" Cassie smiled and took his hand, squeezing it. For someone who was so concerned about being an older father, Sam had thrived since Will had been born. \"We'll talk about it, and we'll talk to him. Nothing's going to be resolved tonight, so don't worry about it right now.\" When they got home, the sounds of high pitched and deep laughter met them. Will and George were sitting at the table playing a game. When Will saw his parents enter his eyes lit up. \"Mama! Daddy! You're home! I just beat Grandpa at checkers!\" He rushed up to them, hugging them both together. Sam and Cassie smiled at him and hugged him back. \"Did you both have fun?\" Cassie asked him. Will nodded. \"I finished my homework, too. It was really easy.\" Sam and Cassie glanced at each other. \"Will, go wash up for dinner, please,\" Cassie told him. As he scampered off to the bathroom, Sam turned to Cassie. \"If we don't do this, will we be holding him back?\" She lifted a shoulder in a half shrug. George looked between them questioningly. \"How did the meeting go?\" he asked. Cassie sighed. \"His teacher thinks he needs to be moved to first grade. We need to talk to him about what he wants to do.\" George smiled. \"I'm not surprised at all. He is an extremely bright boy. I didn't even let him beat me,\" he said sheepishly, nodding toward the checkerboard. After dinner, Cassie and Sam sat Will down in the living room for a talk. \"Will, how do you like kindergarten so far?\" Sam asked him. Will shrugged. \"It's okay.\" Cassie frowned. \"You told us last week that you like it. You said that you have friends in your class that you have fun with.\" Will shrugged again, but this time he looked toward the floor and tears were welling up in his eyes. Cassie reached for him and pulled him toward her, hugging him to her side. \"What's going on?\" she asked softly. \"I don't think my friends like me anymore.\" He sniffled. Sam raised an eyebrow and placed his hand on Will's shoulder. \"What do you mean? Why not?\" Will lifted his head. \"One boy, Joey, started calling me 'smarty pants' and now all of them do. They keep following me around at recess calling me that. They never do it when the teacher is looking, and I don't want to be a tattle tale.\" He looked at Sam. \"You told me that I need to do my best, but not make other people feel bad when they can't do something. I tried, but they don't like me anymore.\" Cassie and Sam glanced at each other, as Cassie pulled Will closer and rubbed his back. Will buried his face in his mom's side and hugged her tightly. Sam raised his eyebrows at her and she nodded. He placed his hand on Will's shoulder and gently turned him to face him. \"Will...has kindergarten been too easy for you?\" He hesitated, then nodded. \"Why didn't you tell us?\" Cassie asked. \"Well, because you told me I need to be…humble…\" he said, searching for the word. Cassie and Sam chuckled. \"Oh, buddy,\" Sam said with a smile, \"Being humble means that you don't brag about what you can do and talk about how much better you are than everyone else. You can always tell us how you're feeling.\" Will searched his dad's face, took a deep breath, and nodded. \"Okay. It's too easy. The rest of the class is learning about the sounds that letters make. I already know how to read chapter books. I'm so bored. Ms. Brown is really nice, though. She gives me harder things to work on and she has let me tell the class how I solve math problems.\" \"We had a meeting with Ms. Brown today,\" Sam said. Will nodded. \"I know. Mama told me before she left. I'm not in trouble am I?\" he asked softly. They smiled. \"No, you're not in trouble,\" Cassie said as she poked him gently. \"Why? Did you do something we don't know about?\" she asked teasingly. Will perked up and grinned. \"Well…\" he joked. They all laughed, breaking the tension that filled the room up to that point. \"Will, what do you think about going to first grade? Ms. Brown said that kindergarten is not the right place for you, and I'm beginning to think she's right. If you do this, you would start first grade in the next couple of weeks,\" Sam said. Will thought about it. \"First grade? Really? That means that I would be in the same grade as Jenna!\" Jenna was Will's best friend, the daughter of one of Cassie's friends. \"You would be,\" Cassie said with a smile, \"It would be a little more of a challenge for you.\" Will sat up straight and puffed out his chest. \"I think I'll be okay. I might be smarter than some of the other kids in my new class, too,\" he said with a grin. Sam and Cassie bit back smiles and Sam reached over and poked Will gently in the shoulder. \"Now THIS is what I meant by being humble and not bragging,\" he said with a soft smile. Will pursed his lips, holding back a smile. \"Sorry,\" he said. The mischievous spark, however, remained in his eyes. Cassie stood up and reached for Will's hand. \"Well, your daddy and I need to talk about it, but let's get you to bed. We will talk more about it in the morning,\" she said. Sam stood up and joined them for Will's bedtime routine. When they were tucking him in, Will bit his lip and looked at his parents. \"Mama? Daddy? Do you think I'll make new friends in first grade?\" Cassie smiled and leaned down to kiss his cheek. \"Oh, honey, of course.\" Sam grinned and gently tickled Will's side. \"Of course. You have a mix of the Radford and Nightingale charm. I think it'll be okay,\" he said with a chuckle as he bent down to kiss his son's forehead. It was. The next week saw Will's testing come back and he started first grade the week after, ending up in the same class as his best friend. She introduced him to the rest of her friends in the class, and Will was happier than ever. While Cassie and Sam were still concerned about their future 17 year old son going off to college, their little 5 year-old boy was happy, so they were too.[Chapter 13] Happy reading! The doorbell at Grey House rang out, and Will ran to the door before anyone could stop him. \"I'll get it Mama!\" he yelled. He opened the door to find an unknown man standing there. \"Hi. Welcome to Grey House. Do you have a reservation?\" Will asked, repeating what he had heard his mom say dozens of times. The man shook his head and smiled down at him. \"You must be William,\" he said. Will's eyes narrowed slightly, trying to figure out how this man knew his name. Just then, his mom came walking around the corner. \"Will, what have we told you about answering the door? That could be…\"she stopped. \"Ryan?!\" Cassie exclaimed, shocked. \"Wow. What are you doing here? How is London?\" she asked, as she pulled him into a brief hug. Ryan smiled. \"I was in Chicago on business, and I thought I'd check in with some old friends,\" he said. \"London has been great. The real estate market is booming there, and I've been making a lot of sales.\" His eyes drifted to Will, who was still standing by the open door. \"So… is this your son? William?\" Cassie smiled. \"Yes, Will. Will, this is my old friend Ryan. He used to live here in Middleton.\" Will smiled, showing a single dimple in his cheek, and shook Ryan's hand. \"Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Will. William Alexander Radford,\" he said with confidence. \"My initials spell WAR, but I'm really nice.\" He said with a grin. Cassie and Ryan chuckled and Ryan bent down to examine Will more closely. \"Wow. He's like a little Sam, isn't he?\" he said, eyebrows raised. Cassie nodded, smiling. \"If you only knew,\" she said. \"You know my dad?\" Will asked, looking at Ryan. Ryan hesitated. \"I know him a little. He had only lived here in Middleton for a year or so before I moved away,\" he said, glancing at Cassie. Cassie gave him an awkward smile and shifted her eyes. Ryan caught her hand, squeezing it gently. \"No, no. I don't want you to feel guilty about that. Things have worked out well…for both of us,\" he said, glancing at Will. Just then, Sam walked into the entryway. \"Cassie, have you seen…\" he stopped suddenly, spotting Ryan and immediately eyeing Cassie's hand in his. Ryan dropped her hand and reached out to shake Sam's. Sam automatically shook it. \"Ryan. I didn't know you were in town,\" he said, looking at Cassie questioningly. Cassie shrugged. Ryan smiled, watching the nonverbal communication between the two. \"I didn't tell anyone. It was kind of a last minute trip.\" Sam nodded and glanced at Will, who was watching the interaction between his parents and this man with fascination. \"Daddy? What are you looking for?\" Will asked. Sam looked at his son, confused. \"What do you mean?\" Will gave his dad a perplexed look. \"When you came into the room you were asking Mama if she had seen something, and then you stopped. Why did you stop?\" Sam shut his eyes briefly, inwardly cursing his son's highly observant nature. \"Oh. It doesn't matter, buddy. I stopped because I hadn't seen Ryan in a while and I was surprised.\" Will was about to ask another question, but Cassie broke in. \"Ryan, we were about to have dinner. Would you like to join us?\" Ryan looked between Cassie, Sam, and Will, all with different expressions on their faces. Cassie looked friendly and hopeful, Sam was wary but not unkind, and Will was still trying to figure him out. He laughed. \"I'd love to. You don't mind?\" he said. \"Of course not!\" Cassie said. You're always welcome.\" She wrapped her arm around Sam's waist, and led them all into the dining room. \"I hope you don't mind lasagna. It's Will's favorite,\" she said. Ryan glanced at the boy, who was bouncing up and down, grinning. He couldn't help but be charmed by this kid, and he chuckled at his exuberance. Will bounced up to him. \"This is my seat, this is Mama's and Daddy's. You can sit here,\" he said, pointing at the chair next to Sam's. Meanwhile, Cassie and Sam had entered the kitchen to get the food and an extra place setting. Sam glanced back toward the dining room. \"Did you know he was coming?\" he whispered. Cassie shook her head. \"No. I haven't heard from him in a while. He's working in London now and he said he's been in Chicago on business,\" she said, as she handed Sam the lasagna and placed an extra place setting, along with garlic bread and salad on a tray to carry in to the dining room. \"That was a little bit of a cold greeting you gave him out there,\" she said, eyeing him. Sam looked at her incredulously. \"How did you expect me to react? I hadn't seen the man in 9 or 10 years, and when I did, he was holding my wife's hand. It was like a weird time warp,\" Sam whispered. Cassie sighed. \"Sam, he grabbed my hand to tell me that he doesn't want me to feel guilty about what happened between the two of us. He said that things worked out well for everyone, which I believe as well.\" Sam took a deep breath. \"Sorry. Ryan brings up unpleasant memories for me…\" Cassie smiled and took the lasagna from his hands, setting it back on the counter. She wrapped her arms around his neck, holding him tightly to her. \"There's no need to feel like that. Ryan and I were good friends, but nothing more. You and I…are obviously something way more. Proof of that is currently sitting in the dining room, probably badgering Ryan with questions,\" she whispered. They both chuckled before coming together in a lingering kiss. When they pulled apart, she lightly swatted his shoulder. \"Now let's get back in there before our son gets Ryan's life story.\" Sam laughed and picked up the lasagna, following Cassie back into the dining room. \"So, you sell houses? What kind of houses do you sell? Are they expensive? Do you make a lot of money? Wait…sorry…Dad said I can't ask people that. Do you like it? What kind of people do you meet?\" Cassie and Sam had walked into the Armageddon of questioning: Will was peppering Ryan with question after question, not waiting for a response. \"Will,\" Sam said, getting his attention. \"Give Ryan a break. Let's eat.\" Ryan looked at him gratefully and he grinned. \"Will likes to know everything. Give him an evening of your time and he'll be an expert in real estate before it's over.\" Sam explained. Ryan looked over at Will, who had quieted down now that dinner had arrived. He was staring at his plate that his dad was dishing up. \"Do you want to sell houses when you grow up?\" he asked Will. Will looked surprised and shook his head. \"No. I'm going to be a doctor like my daddy. I already have my own lab coat and stethoscope, and I'm asking for a microscope for Christmas,\" he told Ryan with a smile, getting his plate of food that his dad handed him. Ryan nodded. \"I'm not surprised,\" he said. \"Daddy even said that we could dissect a frog together when I get a little older,\" Will said as he was eating. \"Will, use your manners please. Don't talk with food in your mouth, and we don't talk about cutting apart dead animals during dinner,\" Cassie scolded, looking somewhere between amused and disgusted. Sam hid his smirk behind his fork and decided to change the subject. \"So, Ryan…what's new with you? I mean in the last 10 years or so,\" he asked. Ryan swallowed his garlic bread before replying. \"Oh, things are great. I am engaged to a wonderful woman. Her name is Anna. We met at work and just clicked.\" Cassie and Sam both congratulated him. \"I'm glad you found your right person,\" Cassie said with a smile. She glanced at Sam, who reached out his hand to squeeze hers. Will looked up from his lasagna. \"Mama…\" Cassie looked at her son expectantly. \"What do you mean by right person?\" he asked, with a curious look. Cassie thought for a second. \"Right now, you just worry about having good friends who make you a better person. When you're older, you'll want to find that person who makes you feel like you always want to be around them.\" \"But I always want to be around you and Daddy,\" Will said, his eyebrows pushed together. Cassie laughed and leaned over to kiss his cheek. \"We want to be around you, too. Just trust me when I say that you'll find out when you're older.\" Will shrugged and continued eating his dinner. Cassie looked back at Ryan. \"Do you have a place to stay tonight?\" He nodded. \"I do. Thanks for asking, though.\" Will spoke up, \"May I be excused? I'm almost done with my book, and I REALLY want to know what happens.\" Cassie nodded. \"Put your dishes in the sink first and come and say goodbye to Ryan before you go upstairs.\" He nodded and headed into the kitchen before returning a short time later. He walked up to Ryan. \"It was nice to meet you,\" he said. Ryan gave him a smile and patted him on the shoulder. \"It was nice to meet you, too, Will. You seem like a pretty awesome kid.\" Will smiled and half shrugged. \"Thanks. Bye!\" He looked at his parents and grinned before leaving the room. Ryan turned back to Cassie and Sam. \"He really is a great kid.\" They both nodded. \"Thanks. We think so,\" Sam said. He got up and began taking the dishes to the kitchen to get the dishwasher started. When Cassie started to get up, he held out a hand. \"I'll take care of the dishes tonight and go get Will ready for bed. You go visit with Ryan for a bit,\" he said, leaning over and giving her a quick kiss. Straightening up, he walked over to Ryan and held out his hand. \"It was good to see you, Ryan. Congratulations again on your engagement.\" They shook hands and Sam continued to clear the table while Cassie and Ryan went to the living room to chat. A couple of hours later, Cassie had said goodnight to Ryan and went to check on Will, who was sleeping peacefully. Entering her room, she noticed that the bedside lamp was on, but there was no Sam. \"Sam? Are you in here?\" she asked, as she entered the bathroom. He was standing at the sink, shirtless, brushing his teeth. \"Hey, how 'as or 'isit?\" he asked, toothbrush in mouth. Cassie wrapped her arms around him from behind, smiling when she felt his abdominal muscles contract. \"It was good. It was fun to catch up. I told him all about what's going on here, and he kept saying how impressed he was by Will. He said he's getting married in a few months, and that he'd like to bring her to Middleton to visit in the next year or so.\" Sam put his toothbrush back in the holder and turned in her arms, so he was facing her. \"I'm glad he found someone. You know, in a way, we have Ryan to thank for us meeting and being together,\" Sam said. Cassie looked confused. \"Really? Why?\" Sam smiled. \"Because he sold me the house next door,\" he whispered in her ear as he pulled her closer, \"And, something WAS wrong with that combination lock.\" She laughed and pulled his face down to hers in a kiss. \"That number 13 ended up being lucky…for both of us,\" she said. \"My new favorite number,\" Sam said, drawing her in for another kiss.[Chapter 14] For Ana—thanks for the request. Hopefully this is similar to what you were looking for. Disclaimer—I don't presume to know how Cassie receives her \"inspiration,\" but visions worked best for my story. I also realize that Will acts older than what I'm writing him as—that has to do with my belief that Cassie's and Sam's son would be brilliant and well-adjusted, as well as have an exceptional vocabulary and social skills. Cassie felt Will's presence right before he entered the kitchen of Grey House, and she could tell he wasn't happy. She looked up just in time to see him slam the door shut and run upstairs. She was dumbfounded. It was rare for her normally calm and stable son to react so emotionally. She stared up the stairs in the direction he had gone, wondering if she should go after him or if she should give him some space. She decided on the former. After making the short climb upstairs, she paused at his bedroom door and knocked softly. \"Honey? What's wrong?\" \"Nothing!\" came the teary reply. Cassie stood outside the door, torn between honoring his wishes and ripping the door open to comfort her baby. \"Are you sure?\" she called back. \"I can make some hot chocolate, and we can talk.\" \"No thanks, Mom,\" he said brokenly, \"I just want to be alone.\" She turned away from the door, worry gnawing at her insides. What had happened at school that caused him to react in such a way? George stepped out of his room. \"What's going on with our boy?\" he asked. \"I head the door slam from up here and the sobbing as he came up the stairs. Cassie shrugged, a concerned look crossing her face. \"Did he tell you anything was happening at school today? We didn't miss anything did we? A field trip or something?\" she asked. George shook his head. \"Not that I know of. He normally talks about that stuff for days or weeks before it actually happens.\" Cassie shook her head. \"He doesn't want to talk, but I'm going in there to try to pry something out of him. This is totally uncharacteristic of him, so it must be something big,\" she said. She knocked on Will's door again, but opened the door before he could reply. \"Will?\" she said, stepping into the room. \"Mom…go away. Please.\" She walked over and sat down on the edge of his bed, where he was lying face down, hands over his head. \"Not until you tell me what's wrong,\" she said, running her fingers through his short, dark hair. \"It hurts me to see you like this.\" He rolled over so he was staring up at the ceiling, but he still didn't look at her. \"What happened?\" she asked simply. He sighed, covering his face with his hands. \"Some of the older boys at school were teasing Jenna at recess. I told them to knock it off, but that made them mad and they turned their attention to me. They told me that they heard I was an…accident. That you and Dad didn't want me, but you got stuck with me anyway. They said that you were both old and didn't want any more kids, but I came along and you couldn't get rid of me.\" He finished, finally looking her in the eye. \"Is that true?\" Cassie was horrified. She reached for her son and dragged him to her. He was a little too big for her lap, but she did the best she could to hold him as tightly as possible. \"Oh, honey. Of course it's not true! Yes, you were a surprise addition to our family, but very welcome, and definitely not an accident. Just because we have surprises, it doesn't mean that they are bad. Those boys were being mean and vindictive, and they have no idea what they are talking about. Our family has been the source of gossip for this town for years, and it seems like it has now spread to the younger generation. I'm so sorry,\" she said, cradling him in her arms like he was a baby. \"Really?\" \"Yes. Now do you want to hear the real story?\" she asked. He nodded. She placed her hand on his cheek and began. \"Well, it all started 8 years ago. Your dad and I had been married for about a year, and we were both very happy. One day, though, I started to feel a little…different… \" FLASHBACK- 8 YEARS EARLIER \"Mom! Have you seen my permission slip? I need it signed and returned today!\" Grace called into the kitchen. Cassie found the slip on the side counter and held it up for her daughter to grab. \"Thanks!\" she called as she rushed out of the house with Nick in tow. Cassie chuckled. \"Have a good day, you two!\" she called after them. As soon as the door closed, a powerful vision swept over her. She could see a little boy knocking at the door…the same door that Grace and Nick had just walked out of. She couldn't see his face well, but he was knocking frantically—she could tell he was sad and scared. It startled her so much that as soon as she came back to her senses, she checked the door. No boy. Confused, she went around to the front door, just to be sure. Still no boy. Just then, Sam came walking down the stairs, tying his tie. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, noticing her expression. She shook her head. \"Nothing, everything is fine. You look handsome today. You know that's my favorite tie,\" she said softly, wrapping her arms around his neck. He gave her a brilliant smile. \"I know. That's why I'm wearing it.\" He gave her a quick kiss. He pulled back to look at her. \"Are you sure you're okay. You look a little shaken.\" She nodded and smiled. \"I'm sure. Have a good day. I love you.\" He kissed her again. \"I love you, too. Have a good day at the shop.\" After Sam left, Cassie couldn't stop thinking about the little boy at the door. He was young, maybe 6 or 7, and had dark brown hair. She hadn't seen his face clearly enough to determine eye color. Was there a new family in Middleton that she hadn't met yet? Was this boy going to be a guest? The questions continued to plague her throughout her work day at Bell, Book & Candle. She had had many feelings and visions over the years, but for some reason, this one hit her hard. She wanted to help the boy, but didn't know what to do. Who was he? She began to feel sick just thinking about this boy, all alone and possibly scared, knocking at her door. Where was his family? Was he lost? All of these thoughts continued to race though her head as Martha stepped through the door. \"Cassie? Cassie?\" She finally looked up. \"Cassie…I've been calling your name for a minute now. Are you okay? You don't look like you're feeling very well.\" Suddenly, Cassie had an overwhelming urge to throw up. Clamping her hand over her mouth, she ran to the back restroom and emptied the contents of her stomach. Cleaning up at the sink, she looked into the mirror. What was going on with her? Was she so concerned about this vision that she made herself sick? How did that explain the tired eyes looking back at her in the mirror? Come to think of it, she thought, I have been pretty tired lately. Maybe I should bring that up at my wellness visit with Dr. Long tomorrow . The rest of the day at Bell, Book, & Candle passed by smoothly. When she got home, Grace was baking cookies in the kitchen. \"Hey, honey,\" she said, kissing her daughter on the side of the head. \"How was your day?\" As Grace told her about what she did at school that day, an unpleasant smell hit her. Nausea overwhelmed her once more, and she found herself running to the bathroom for the second time that day. When she returned to the kitchen, Grace looked worried. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, concerned. Cassie nodded. \"I think I picked up a stomach bug somewhere. It's not too bad, though.\" There was a knock at the door and Cassie froze. In her mind she could see the little boy again, but this time she heard his voice. \"Mom! Dad! Let me in! Please! I'm scared and all by myself.\" The vision faded in time for her to look up and see Brandon coming through the door. \"Hey, Grace, hey Cassie. I just…\" he noticed Cassie's wide eyes staring back at him. \"Is everything okay?\" He walked up to her and placed his hand on her arm. \"You're really pale, and you look like you've seen a ghost!\" Cassie nodded and gave him a weak smile. \"I'm just not feeling too well. Did you need something?\" she asked. Brandon shook his head. \"I'll talk to Grace about it. You should go lie down.\" Cassie smiled at him gratefully and walked into the living room. She stretched out on the couch, pillow behind her head, and promptly fell fast asleep. She woke an hour later to Grace gently shaking her shoulder. \"Mom, Sam texted and said he would be about 15 minutes late. Are you feeling better?\" Cassie stretched and nodded. \"I am. Honey…\" Grace looked at her questioningly and she hesitated, \"Can you not tell Sam about this? You know how he worries about things. I really am feeling better.\" Grace was conflicted. On one hand, her mom did seem to be feeling better, but on the other hand, if she was still sick, Sam could help her. Reluctantly, Grace nodded. \"Okay. I'm going to grab Nick and we'll get dinner ready tonight. You just rest, Mom.\" Cassie gave her a grateful smile as Grace walked out of the room. One word struck her- \"Mom…\"The words of her last vision came back to her. A little boy was all alone and looking for his parents, and he was knocking on HER door. All of a sudden, reality washed over her as 4 little words wriggled their way into her brain. He… is… YOUR… son. Shocked, she sat back heavily against the couch cushions, mouth open. She was pregnant. It would explain everything—the visions, the nausea, the smell sensitivity, the tiredness. She had always wanted another child, but she was too old to have a baby—wasn't she? Panic seized her. She was in her late forties with a daughter who was almost an adult. Could she really raise another child? Just then, the vision returned, but this time she could see the boy's face and she knew that this was her son. He was a beautiful combination of Sam and her. In her vision, the door that the boy had been knocking on opened and an arm…her arm… pulled him close. Peace enveloped her as the vision ended. She looked up just in time to see Sam walk through the door, loosening his tie. Should I tell him? she thought. No. I'd better get it confirmed at my doctor's appointment tomorrow. Then, if it's really true, I'll figure out how to tell Sam . When she had her pregnancy confirmed the next day, it became real for Cassie, and the shock returned. When she told Sam, her emotions got the best of her and she panicked. By the end of their conversation, however, peace settled in. Peace turned to excitement as she felt the baby grow inside of her. She never did tell Sam about the visions, nor was she surprised when she found out that she was having a boy. As Will grew, he looked more and more like the boy in her vision. She could never forget his face. Then, one day when Will was over at Jenna's house for too long, he accidentally got locked out of the house. Cassie heard the frantic knocking from upstairs. As she came closer to the kitchen, she heard familiar words that had been rolling around in her brain for 7 years, \"Mom! Dad! Let me in! Please! I'm scared and all by myself!\" She had flung the door open and drew her now familiar and wonderful son toward her. \"Don't worry, honey. I'm here. We're together,\" she said, holding him close. END FLASHBACK Will looked up at her in amazement. \"So…you saw me before I was born?\" Cassie nodded. \"I did. I loved you from the moment I realized who you were. Now, that doesn't mean I wasn't scared, that's absolutely normal, but both your dad and I loved you and wanted you more than anything.\" \"Really?\" he questioned. \"Really. In fact, we were so excited, that I had to hold your dad back from buying every baby product ever made,\" Cassie recalled, laughing. Will gave her his crooked grin that she loved so much, and he reached up to hug her. \"I love you, Mom. I couldn't imagine being in any other family.\" Tears pricked in Cassie's eyes, \"I love you, too, honey. I can't imagine life without you.\" \"It wouldn't be the same without you,\" they heard Sam say from the doorway. They both looked up at him. \"You're a very important part of our family. Oh, and I didn't want to buy EVERY baby product. Just the really cool ones,\" Sam said with a smirk, as he walked over and sat next to his wife on the bed. Both Cassie and Will laughed. \"How long had you been standing there?\" Cassie asked. \"Long enough. It's the first time I'd heard that story, so I was riveted, just like Will,\" he said. He rubbed his son's shoulder. \"George told me that something happened at school. I want to hear about it later, but for now, you need to know that you are one of the most important people in our lives, and I wouldn't change that for a second,\" Sam said as he drew his son in for a hug and wiped a stray tear from his cheek. \"Now,\" he said with a grin, \"I do believe you challenged me to a game of one-on-one this morning. Are you up for it?\" Will's eyes lit up and he nodded, jumping off his bed. \"I'll go get the ball!\" he yelled behind him as he ran out of his room. Cassie laughed and leaned her head against Sam's shoulder. \"He was the best surprise I could ever imagine,\" she said softly. Sam kissed the top of her head and drew her close. \"Well, one of the best, at least,\" he said with a soft smile, looking straight into her eyes. She smiled and kissed him gently. \"DAD! Come on!\" they heard from somewhere down the hall. They broke apart and grinned at each other before joining their son in front of the house for some basketball.[Chapter 15] Disclaimer: Not mine, but I have fun playing with the characters. Be warned—this one gets a little \"sickly sweet\". Also, I can't wait until April 29 th ! \"William Radford, what is going on?!\" Cassie exclaimed as she walked into kitchen. She had come home from a long day of work to find her 8 year old son chasing frogs that were hopping around all over her kitchen. She stood there in shock for a second before turning to Will, who had the presence of mind to look ashamed. His mom didn't full-name him very often, so he knew she wasn't happy. \"Sorry, Mom,\" he said, \"I was just trying to use them as test subjects for my new experiment, but they got out.\" She helped Will capture the rest of the frogs and put them back into the box. \"Will, next time you want to use live creatures in one of your experiments, please do it in the garage,\" she pleaded. Will nodded his head and made his way to the garage to set up his \"laboratory\". Once he was gone, Cassie chuckled and shook her head. That boy was just like his father. He was always creating little experiments and helping his dad at the clinic. However, he also had the softest heart of anyone she had ever met. While he had not inherited the \"Merriwick gift\" (that was generally passed down from mother to daughter), he had an amazing ability to read the people around him. He was definitely a unique and special little boy. The smile left her face when she looked around and realized that she would have to sanitize every inch of the kitchen. Sighing, she picked up her cleaning spray and rag and went to work. Will came back a few minutes later and helped for a little while, which gave her the opportunity to ask him about his new experiment. His face lit up, \"Well, I'm not going to dissect them this time like Dad and I did. I'm going to test their reflexes by…\" he continued. Cassie's thoughts wandered as her son continued his detailed explanation about control groups and just how he was going to test the reflexes of the frogs. She thought about Sam. He had been gone for a while now, and she missed him like crazy. Everything she saw around her reminded her of him…the little dimple in Will's cheek when he smiled and his bright blue eyes that seemed to be able to see into her soul when he looked at her, Sam's toothpaste that still sat on their bathroom counter, his pillow that still smelled so much like him that she snuggled with it every night. Her thoughts were brought back to her son when she realized that he had stopped talking. He was watching her with a sad look on his face. \"You miss Dad, don't you?\" he asked. She nodded. \"I do, too,\" he frowned. Cassie gathered her son in her arms and gave him a squeeze. \"It's okay to miss him. It just means that we are lucky enough to love someone enough to miss them when they're gone,\" she told him. He nodded. \"Well, then we're really lucky, right?\" he asked. Cassie grinned and put her hand on his cheek. \"That we are.\" Cassie thought for a moment and then began to move around the kitchen with a purpose. Will watched her closely and perked up when he realized that she was getting baking ingredients out. \"I think we need a distraction,\" she said. \"Are you making Christmas cookies?\" he excitedly asked. She grinned. \"No, WE'RE making Christmas cookies! Go wash your hands really well. You've been touching frogs.\" As Will ran off to the bathroom she called, \"WITH SOAP!\" \"Okay!\" he yelled back. Cassie had just started measuring the flour when she heard the door open and felt the familiar presence behind her. She grinned as strong arms wrapped around her waist and hugged her from behind. \"I'm home,\" a deep voice whispered in her ear. She grinned and turned around, flinging her arms around his neck and hugging him tightly to her. \"Sam! I thought you weren't going to be home until tomorrow!\" He chuckled. \"The last day of the conference didn't pertain to me, so I decided to surprise you and come home early,\" he said before kissing her soundly. \"Well, you definitely surprised me. There's someone else who will be excited to see you too!\" she said, pulling away just enough to look him in the eyes. Just then Will came into the room. \"Okay, Mom. I promise that I washed WITH soap…\" Will trailed off as he noticed his dad in the room. \"DAD! You're home!\" he yelled as he ran up to him. Sam easily picked his son up and hugged him. \"You've been gone for forever!\" Will complained as Sam set him back down. Sam chuckled, \"Wow. I've only been gone 5 days and it's seemed like forever. I guess I am pretty popular around here,\" he joked. He looked down at his son, whose arms were wrapped around his middle, then glanced at Cassie whom he had put his arm around and hugged close. Cassie smiled and kissed him softly. \"Yes, you are.\" Will broke the hug and grinned brightly. \"Dad, you're just in time! Mom and I were about to make Christmas cookies!\" Sam smiled at his son's excitement. \"Ooh, I LOVE Christmas cookies,\" he said with slight exaggeration, poking Will in the stomach. He hung up his coat on the rack and grabbed his luggage. \"I'm going to take a quick shower and I'll be down to help decorate.\" Will nodded and went to work helping his mom measure the ingredients for the cookies. When the first batch was in the oven and the timer set, Cassie charged her son with keeping an eye on the time. \"I'm going to upstairs for a minute. If the timer goes off before I come back, come and find me,\" she said, heading upstairs. When she walked into their bedroom, Sam was just coming out of the bathroom, fully clothed, toweling his hair dry. \"Hey. Are the cookies done already?\" he asked, flipping the towel into the hamper. She stepped closer and wrapped her arms around him, breathing in the scent of his soap and shampoo. \"Not yet. I just wanted a minute alone with you. I missed you,\" she said with a smile. He held her closer. \"I missed you, too. Next time I go somewhere, I'm taking you with me!\" he said with a laugh. Cassie grinned and pulled his head toward hers, kissing him. \"Ewww! I don't want to see that!\" They broke apart to see Will standing at the door with a scrunched up face and his hands covering his eyes. They laughed and walked to him, pulling him into a group hug. Cassie treasured these moments. She knew that Will was growing up quickly and would soon no longer want hugs from his parents, but for now, she held both of them close to her like a lifeline, never willing to let go. That is, until the smoke alarm went off.[Chapter 16] Disclaimer: I still don't own Good Witch. Sorry for the delay. I am a teacher, and the last couple of months of school are…rough. I'm on summer break now, though! Yay! \"Cassie, we're here!\" Nick called out to his stepmother as he led his fiancée, Lauren, into Grey House. He and Lauren had been together for about a year and a half. They worked at the same advertising firm and hit it off, bonding over a shared history in the Midwest (she was from Milwaukee). He had proposed to her 6 months earlier, and their wedding day was rapidly approaching. Even though they lived and worked in Los Angeles, they both wanted to get married at Grey House. Cassie stepped away from the stove and gave Nick and Lauren hugs. \"Oh, welcome home! I'm so happy you were both able to come a couple of days early to spend some time with the family before the wedding. I've been looking forward to it, and I know at least a few other people who feel the same way,\" she said, glancing toward the door with a smile on her face, laughing when her 9 year old son burst through. \"Nick!\" Will yelled out, as he ran toward his big brother. \"You're finally here!\" He wrapped his arms around Nick and squeezed, causing Nick to glance up at Cassie with a grin on his face and return his brother's embrace. \"Good to see you, too, little bro,\" Nick said, softly punching Will's shoulder. He raised his hand up toward the top of Will's head. \"Holy cow, kid. You've grown even more since I saw you a couple of months ago at Christmas! You'll be taller than me soon,\" he said playfully, pushing down on the top of his little brother's head in an attempt to make him shorter. Will laughed and shook his head. \"Mom said I might even be as tall as or taller than dad when I grow up. Then I'll definitely beat him at basketball!\" he said with a small smirk. Just then, Sam entered the room. \"Hey, watch out. I'm still bigger than you,\" he said laughing, pointing a finger at his younger son. He gave Nick a quick hug and kissed Lauren's cheek. \"Good to see you guys. I'm glad you were able to come a couple of days early to spend some time with the family before the wedding,\" Sam said. Nick and Lauren looked at each other and burst out laughing. Sam cocked his head toward Cassie, his face a mask of confusion. She just grinned at him. Nick smirked at his dad. \"You two are starting to think alike,\" he said, glancing between his dad and Cassie. \"Those were the exact words that Cassie said when we first got here.\" Sam laughed and walked over to his wife, wrapping his arm around her. \"Boy, did you ever think that someone would say we thought alike? Especially when we first met…\" he asked Cassie with a grin on his face before kissing her cheek. Cassie laughed and shook her head. \"Definitely not, but like all great things, practice… and a lot of patience helps,\" she said, holding back a smile. Sam gave narrowed his eyes playfully and opened his mouth to retort when Will cut in. \"Mom! You said that Grace and Luke were supposed to show up before Nick and Lauren. Where are they?\" Will queried, referring to his sister and her husband of 2 years. \"Right here, baby brother.\" Will whipped his head around toward the dining room. \"Grace! I thought you'd never get here!\" he yelled out, giving her a similar hug he had just given his brother a few minutes earlier. He released his sister only so she could give out hugs to the rest of the family. Grace's husband Luke came in and set their suitcases down, greeting Cassie and Lauren with hugs, and Sam and Nick with handshakes. He then turned his attention back to Grace, wrapping his arm around her. \"I brought a brand new baseball glove, but I think it might be a little too small for me. Do you know anyone who might enjoy it?\" he said with a wink, before turning to Will. Will's eyes lit up. \"Seriously? I just outgrew my old one!\" he said before hugging him. Grace and Luke had met at Northwestern. He had played college baseball as an undergrad before focusing his attention on his studies for his PhD in Pharmacy. They had both been done with school for a few years now and lived and worked in Chicago, calling a modest 1 bedroom apartment home. Being so close, they were able to come home to Middleton frequently to see her family. Luke and Will had bonded over their love for sports. While Will's number one sport was still basketball, he had grown to love baseball, especially with Luke coaching him on the finer points of the game. Will pulled at Luke's arm in an attempt to nudge him outside where he had his baseball stuff ready. \"Hold on, Will. Before you steal my husband, we have an announcement…\" Grace said with a smile. Luke stepped up and wrapped his arm around her middle, a smile quickly growing on his face. Cassie grinned and glanced at Sam, noting his understanding dawning. He whipped his head toward Cassie, eyebrows raised, before looking back at Grace. \"You mean…\" he started. Grace laughed. \"Yes, we're going to have a baby.\" A cheer went up throughout Grey House as the family whole heartedly welcomed the news. Grace held her hands up. \"Wait…there's more,\" she said with a grin. \"You're not having twins are you?\" Nick teased. Grace laughed and shook her head. \"Nope, just one.\" She cleared her throat and glanced at her husband. He gave her an encouraging smile. \"We've known about this baby for a month or so now. We just wanted to wait to tell you until the family was all together.\" Everyone nodded. She continued, \"Well, when we found out, we both realized that we didn't want to raise a child in Chicago. It's a great place, but Middleton is even better.\" Gasps rose up from the other occupants in the room. Cassie put her hand over her mouth, tears starting to form in her eyes. \"Does that mean what I think it means?\" she asked Grace hopefully, squeezing Sam so tightly he winced. Grace nodded and her mom rushed toward her, enveloping her in a hug. When they pulled back, Grace explained, \"Luckily, there's a spot open in Blairsville for the same company I work for now. It's a relatively new branch, so I'll be helping to open it up for research. Luke found a new job at Hillcrest Hospital, thanks to someone we know…\" All eyes flew to Sam, who had a sheepish look on his face, as if he'd gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. \"Hey, I may not be Chief of Staff anymore, but I still have connections,\" he said. Noticing the slight glare he was receiving from his wife, he held up his hands in surrender. \"Hey, it's not my fault! She told me not to tell!\" He looked at Grace, eyebrows raised, silently begging her to rescue him. Grace laughed and hugged her mom to her. \"It's true. I wanted to surprise you, since it's so hard to do. I'm just surprised that you didn't figure it out. Sam's not exactly hard to read,\" she said with a chuckle. The whole room laughed and Sam shrugged and reached over to give Grace a hug. \"The baby's a surprise, though. Congratulations,\" he said with a big grin on his face. Grace smiled. \"Thanks, Sam.\" She looked between her mom and Sam. \"You guys are going to have to decide...grandma and grandpa, nana and papa…there are a million different names.\" Sam's eyebrows lifted and he looked at his wife in surprise before looking away, eyes beginning water. She smiled and put her hand on his arm and squeezed before looking back at Grace with a grin. Will, who had been watching these interactions quietly, walked up to Grace and gave her a hug. \"Congratulations,\" he said in a soft voice. \"I'm going to go play some basketball. I'll see you later,\" he said, making a quick exit. Sam and Cassie looked at each other, concerned. They both started to go after their son, but Grace put her hands up. \"I'll go,\" she said. \"I think I'm the one he needs to talk to right now.\" They nodded and let her go. As she left in the direction Will had gone, Nick turned toward his parents. \"Well, Pops, how does it feel to know that you're definitely old now?!\" he said with a grin. \"Or is it Grandpa?\" Sam laughed and poked his son in the side. \"Watch it! Old or not, I can still beat you on the court!\" Laughing, Nick put his arm back around Lauren. \"I think we should find our rooms and get settled in. I want to test this theory of Dad's that he can still beat me, even at his ancient age,\" he said with a wink to Lauren and a grin at his dad. Luke nodded. \"I think I'll do the same. Not beat Sam, but get our stuff put up,\" he said with a laugh. The three of them left the kitchen, leaving Sam and Cassie behind. Cassie glanced toward the door where her son had gone. \"I wonder how that's going?\" she said. Sam shrugged. \"Grace always knows what to say to make things better. I wonder where she gets that from…\" he said with an adoring look at his wife. Cassie smiled and gave him a long kiss. \"Hmm…I don't know…Grandpa,\" she said with a teasing look. Sam grinned. \"Well, GRANDMA, if you figure it out, you let me know,\" he said, kissing her again. … When Grace caught up to Will, he was pounding the basketball into the backboard, similar to what Nick had done all those years ago when he was upset with his Mom and Dad. \"What did that backboard ever do to you?\" she asked in a light, teasing voice. Will turned around and gave her a small smile. \"What are you doing out here?\" Grace put her hand on his shoulder, stopping his next shot. \"Will, what's going on? Are you upset about the baby?\" Will shrugged. \"Not really. It seems like everyone is happy. I just…I don't know.\" \"What? You can tell me,\" she prodded, gently. \"Are you and Luke still going to want to hang out with me after the baby is born? Joe…in my class…his mom had a baby last year, and he said that she doesn't spend any time with him anymore. It's all about the baby now,\" he blurted out, embarrassed. Grace hugged him to her. \"Oh, Will. It's true that I'll be spending a lot of time with the baby. He or she will need a lot of attention. But that doesn't mean that I can't still spend time with you. You're my favorite little brother,\" she said with a grin. Will looked up at her with his signature smirk. \"I'm your only little brother.\" She nudged him. \"Plus, you're going to be an amazing uncle. Think of all the things you can teach this baby. I'm sure you'll have a miniature basketball in his or her hands before their first birthday. Unless Sam beats you to it…\" she said with a laugh. Will's smile grew. \"You think I'll be a good uncle?\" Grace nodded. \"Of course. This baby is going to love you. I know I do.\" She hugged him again. When they pulled back, Will was grinning. \"I love you, too. I'm going to be the best uncle in the whole world.\" Grace smiled. \"I don't doubt it.\"[Chapter 17] Disclaimer—Still don't own Good Witch. If I did, we would have more than 10 episodes a year! :p I've been working on this chapter for a while. It's not the best, and there's not much plot, but it's more a \"day in the life\" kind of chapter. I didn't write Brandon, Tara, and Lori into this for a reason—I'm not so great at including a lot of characters. You can pretend that they're there if you want :). Anyway, hope you enjoy. The 4th of July had always been Will's favorite holiday. His family celebrated it at their lake house playing on the water, having a barbecue, and watching the fireworks go off over the lake. This year they would be adding one more person to the celebrations—Grace and Luke's 9-month old daughter Kinley. He just couldn't wait. \"Dad, when are we leaving for the lake house?\" Will asked for the 10th time that hour. Sam huffed in frustration. \"I'm pretty busy trying to get all of this stuff packed in the car, Will. Why don't you go help your mom pack up the coolers? We might get out of here sooner if you do.\" As he walked into the kitchen, he saw his sister helping their mom while trying to calm a crying Kinley. The baby was in her high chair reaching for her mom and wailing. When Grace saw Will, she smiled and looked at her daughter with big eyes. In an exaggerated voice she said, \"Kin, look who it is! It's Uncle Will!\" Kinley stopped crying and looked in the direction her mom had pointed and gave him a watery smile. Will walked up to his niece with a big grin on his face and tickled her. \"Hey, Kinny! What's the problem, huh? You want your Uncle Will?\" he cooed. When she reached for him, he picked her up out of the high chair and started dancing around the kitchen. Grace sighed with relief and went back to helping with the coolers. \"Thanks, Will. She's feeling kind of cooped up right now as we're trying to get ready to go.\" Will smiled at her and walked over to his mom, bouncing Kinley as he went. \"Mom, Dad said that I should help you with the coolers. Did you get the hot dogs put in there? What about the chocolate for s'mores? Are you almost done? How much longer will it be? Dad seems like he's in a bad mood, so I hope not too long.\" Cassie glanced at Grace with a small smile on her face before turning to face her son. \"Will, why don't you take Kinley into the living room and play for a little while? You can help her play with that toy basketball hoop that your dad got for her. We won't be too much longer.\" Will nodded and left, leaving Cassie and Grace laughing. \"Hmm, I wonder why Sam is in a bad mood,\" Grace said with a grin. She glanced in the direction her little brother had gone. \"He's such a good kid, but boy, when he gets something in his head…\" she continued. Cassie nodded and finished getting everything in the cooler, just in time for Sam to come through the door. She walked up to him and wrapped her arm around his waist. \"Someone told me you're in a bad mood,\" looking into his face with a smirk. Sam sighed. \"Trying to get everything in the car was like losing a giant game of Tetris, and he wouldn't stop asking me when we were leaving. Ten times, seriously. I counted.\" He looked at Cassie and the smirk on her face grew larger until finally he broke out into a chuckle. \"Well, he'll be happy to know that once we HOPEFULLY get these coolers in the back seat, we'll be ready to leave.\" He turned to Grace. \"Are you and Luke all packed up?\" Grace nodded. \"Luke just went to fill up the car before we left. Once he gets back, we're all set. Have you heard from Nick and Lauren? I texted him a little while ago, but he hasn't answered yet,\" she asked Sam as he was reaching down to pick up a cooler. \"Oh, Nick called this morning and said that their flight was delayed, so they are just going to meet us there,\" he said as he headed toward the door. \"They should be there sometime tonight.\" Grace nodded again. \"I'm going to go get Kinley changed and tell Mr. Impatient that we're almost ready,\" she said with a wink at her parents. They all laughed as Sam and Cassie headed outside with the cooler and Grace retrieved her daughter from Will's basketball tutelage. A couple of hours later, they had settled into the lake house, and, much to his son's delight, Sam had gotten the boat ready to go shortly after arriving. Will was the first one to join his dad, life jacket strapped around him tightly, clutching the tube that would pull him around the lake. The look of pure excitement on his face made Sam smile, and he patted his son on the shoulder. \"You're going to have to hold on tight. I'm going to be kicking up some waves for you back there.\" Will looked up at his dad with a grin. \"I can't wait!\" Sam threw his head back and laughed, before looking up at the sky with a frown. Turning to his son, he broke the bad news. \"Will, I know you don't want to hear this, but I don't think we'll be out there for too long. Those clouds look awfully menacing,\" he said. Will looked up and frowned, disappointed. Before the rest of the family could join them, the skies opened up into a torrential downpour, soaking both of them to the skin. After tying the boat to the dock, Sam and Will ran into the house and were met by Cassie at the door, who handed them both towels. \"Yikes! That rain is cold!\" Sam exclaimed, toweling his hair dry before wrapping it around his body. His hair stuck up in every direction and Cassie grinned before turning to her son. \"Will, go take a nice warm shower and change. I'll start a fire in the fireplace, and we can make S'mores.\" Will nodded and gave her a half smile before walking off down the hall. Cassie turned to Sam, who was watching the sadness in Will's face as he walked away. \"Hopefully the storm will pass soon. At the very least, I hope we have good weather for the 4th tomorrow. He looks forward to this every year,\" she said with a frown. Sam nodded, slinging the towel around his shoulders. \"I hope so. He was so excited about going out on the boat.\" Cassie looked him up and down, smiling softly. \"Not that I'm not enjoying the view, but you'd better go shower, too, before you get too chilled,\" she said with a glint in her eye. Sam lifted an eyebrow and glanced around. Noting that they were alone, he suddenly scooted a little closer to Cassie. \"Well, I know of some other ways to warm up,\" Sam whispered in her ear. Cassie laughed. \"Alas, that will have to wait,\" she whispered back, winking at him before glancing across the room. Just then, Grace came strolling in, carrying Kinley. Noticing how closely her mom and Sam were standing, she shook her head. \"You guys…there are children present,\" Grace said in a teasing voice, playfully covering Kinley's eyes. When she noticed that Sam was soaking wet, she glanced outside where the rain was still coming down. \"Oh, no. Poor Will.\" Cassie nodded. \"We'll just have to come up with some fun things to do here in the house for the time being.\" Turning to Sam she said, \"You go, and I'll start the fire. By the time you and Will are back, it should be nice and warm and ready for s'mores.\" Sam nodded and began walking toward the master bedroom before turning around briefly to give her a small smirk. She tilted her head and gave him a smile before softly chuckling and shaking her head. He grinned and went to do what his wife requested. Grace had taken Kinley over to the window to watch the rain, so as Sam left the room, Cassie joined her daughter. \"Do you think the rain will stop by tomorrow?\" Grace asked. \"We haven't been up to the lake house yet this year, and I was hoping Kinley could go on her first boat ride.\" Cassie gave her daughter a mysterious smile. \"Oh, I'm sure these clouds will clear out soon enough, and Miss. Kinley,\" she said, tickling her granddaughter's feet, \"will get to do all sorts of new things.\" Cassie grinned as Kinley began giggling. True to her word, when Sam and Will returned, Cassie had a good -sized fire blazing in the fireplace and s'mores ingredients ready to go. Will's eyes lit up as he looked around, momentarily forgetting his bad luck with the rain. Nick and Lauren had shown up just in time, and the family enjoyed their night together playing games. When everyone was heading to bed, Will stood at the window, watching as the rain continued to pour down. Cassie walked up to him and hugged him to her side. \"We'll have good weather tomorrow, you'll see,\" she said, squeezing him a little. \"Do you think so?\" he asked hopefully, turning toward his mom. She smiled. \"Absolutely. Now go get some sleep. You're going to have a big day on the lake tomorrow,\" she said with a wink. Will grinned and hugged her. \"Thanks, Mom! Oh, and Dad…I want to be on the lake by 8 tomorrow morning!\" he yelled as he ran to his room. Sam's mouth dropped open as he watched his son run out of the room. \"8?\" he questioned, before shaking his head and laughing. He looked around the room and once again noticed he and Cassie were alone. Sidling up to his wife, he wrapped an arm around her. Cassie grinned and held him close. \"I'm feeling a little chilled,\" she said with a glint in her eye. \"Any ideas of how I can warm up?\" Sam laughed and kissed her. \"I have a few,\" he said mischievously. The next morning, Will looked outside to find clear, blue skies, just like his mom had said. Throwing on his swimming suit, he ran downstairs to find that his parents were already up making breakfast. \"You were right, Mom! It's gorgeous outside today!\" he said excitedly, hugging his mom. Cassie just nodded, smiling. Will turned to Sam. \"Dad! Are you ready? I'm already dressed and ready to go!\" Sam, who had just taken a bite of a breakfast burrito, lifted an eyebrow. \"I thought you were joking last night, Will. It's still a bit chilly out there,\" he said, chewing his food and nodding his head toward the lake. Will's face dropped, and Sam glanced at Cassie before sighing. \"But, it should warm up soon. Grab something to eat, and let's get the boat ready to go. Will grinned and jumped on his dad, squeezing him. \"Thanks, Dad! I promise I won't complain about the cold!\" Sam laughed and wrapped his arm around Cassie while Will shoved a burrito down his throat. \"Done! Let's go!\" Will practically jogged out of the house toward the boat. Cassie reached up and gave Sam a kiss. \"You're a really good dad,\" she said with a soft smile. \"Have fun out there. The rest of us will be ready in a couple of hours,\" she said with a laugh. Sam threw his head back and laughed, giving her a quick peck on the cheek before running to catch up with his son. By the time the rest of the family joined them later, Sam and Will had already been around the lake a couple of times. Stopping by the dock to let everyone else on, Sam helped them onto the boat one at a time. Grace handed Kinley to him before grabbing the railing and pulling herself on. When she went to take Kinley back, Sam had taken her to the front of the boat to show her the wheel. \"Look, Kinny! That's how we're going to steer the boat. Do you want to drive the boat with Paw-Paw?\" he asked, tickling her neck under her life jacket. Kinley giggled, eyes shining at Sam. He grinned and kissed her cheek before turning and seeing Grace standing there smiling at them. \"Come here, Kinley,\" she said, reaching for her daughter. \"We'll let you drive the boat with Paw-Paw when we're away from the dock. Everyone's on now, Sam.\" They all had a great time on the lake, with Kinley \"helping\" Sam steer the boat when the water was particularly calm. Will and Nick had a competition to see who could stay on the tube the longest. Due to some particularly choppy waves that Sam created for Nick, Will won. He enjoyed teasing his brother about it for the rest of the day. Once they had had their fill of the boat, they headed back to the house for a barbecue and to wait for the fireworks over the lake. As the sun set, they got their chairs and blankets, and headed out in front of the house to watch the fireworks. Will, pulling his chair up next to his mom's, leaned over and hugged her arm. \"This was the best day ever, Mom! Thank you.\" \"You're welcome, but thank you for what, honey?\" she asked with a smile. Will smiled and narrowed his eyes slightly and tilted his head, giving her a questioning look. \"I'm not sure, really. All I know is that it was supposed to be stormy today, but you told me it was going to be nice and it was. So… thanks, I guess.\" The rest of the family laughed softly, with Sam and Grace exchanging knowing grins. Cassie smiled and placed her hand on her son's cheek before pulling him to her side in a hug. Just then, the fireworks started over the lake. Looking around, Cassie saw Grace holding a fascinated Kinley while Luke and Nick had their arms around their respective wives. Cassie, still holding her son to her, reached to her other side to grab Sam's hand, smiling softly at him. He looked over and smiled back before they both returned their attention to the fireworks. She sighed softly. Family. ","Summary":" Disclaimer—I obviously don't own Good Witch. Cassie walked into Grey House in a daze.

PLEASE TELL ME ON WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF MAX WANTS TO GO BACK TO THE ISLAND OF THE WILD THINGS OR NOT, AND WHAT IF THE WILD THINGS COULD GO SEE MAX ON HIS ISLAND, JUST LIKE WHAT MAX DID TO GO TO THEIR ISLAND. I AM REALLY HOPING FOR A SEQUEL TO WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE MOVIE. THIS IS FOR SPIKE JONZE, MAURICE SENDAK, MAX RECORDS, TOM HANKS, AND FOR THE OTHER CAST AS WELL. ENJOY!) Prologue: Here's what I think for a sequel of Where The Wild Things Are Movie (2009), I am hoping that maybe Carol who will still be voiced by James Gandolfini and KW who is voiced by Lauren Ambrose will maybe get married and maybe have a baby together (Mmmm), and maybe we will see Carol and KW kissing with the other Wild Things watching, which will still be voiced by Paul Dano as Alexander, Chris Cooper as Douglas, Forest Whitaker as Ira, Michael Berry, Jr. as the Bull (Daniel) and Catherine O'Hara as Judith, along with Max Records as Max, with Catherine Keener as Max's mother name Connie, and the girl that played Max's older sister name Claire. For the sequel to begin, I will like it to take place on the island of the Wild Things, with a beautiful blue clear sky, not a cloud in it as well, with a beautiful bright sun, then, the camera will move down, till we see the Warner Brothers sign, along with the other signs for production, and then, we'll see the title called WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE 2 till we get to see the blue ocean until we come across the island of the Wild Things, which still looks the same when Max saw the island of the Wild Things for the first time. Once we come to the island of the Wild Things, we'll see the names of the same cast that came from the first movie in Carol's secret hideaway cave where he made his model city, then, we come out of Carol's secret hideaway cave, we come across the sandy desert and the big dog walking along, minding its own business, then, we come across the forest where the Wild Things' old huts were destroyed by tearing them down, and then, finally, we come across the fortress with all seven Wild Things inside of it; the Wild Things are; Carol, who is the leader with the dark and light brown stripes, feathery legs, golden eyes, a pink-button nose, a dark brown mane around his face, and two small half-moon horns. KW, she is the loner and Carol's true love, she is very pretty, she has auburn hair, with beautiful golden eyes, red or orange fur, with duck or chicken feet, but in this sequel, she and Carol are married and they are now expecting a baby into their family. Douglas, who is the bird-like Wild Thing, and he has white feathers all over his body, and he is Carol's right hand man and best friend. Ira, Alexander and Judith, who are the troll-like Wild Thing, goat-like Wild Thing, and rhino-like Wild Thing, Ira has a big oval nose, and looks like a sad-eyed troll-like Wild Thing with two small horns, who is good making tunnels and puts holes in trees, and who is very friendly, and lover to Judith, who is a rhino-like Wild Thing that has a two long horns on top of her head which she has long brown hair, with golden fur, and a horn on her nose, and she's a downer, while Alexander is the goat-like Wild Thing, who seems to be the youngest and wants attention from everybody. The Bull or Daniel is the black bull-like Wild Thing with two human feet, who is also the quiet one and stands to the side who wants to be alone, and not get involved, but for this story, I am going to let him…talk, so he could say anything he wants, just like what he did in the ending when he talked to Max. This sequel will be about when the Wild Things are about to go to Max's island and see Max, so that way they could see what is like to live with Max and his family, and be part of his life and his family, so the bond that both Carol and Max had shared is still with them, so their bond will keep on growing a lot stronger, so Carol could see what is like to be a father-figure to Max since Max needs a father in his life since right after his father and mother got a divorce and went their own separate ways. (This is part of what I think for a sequel of Where The Wild Things Are Movie to happen, someday, because…On the Where The Wild Things Are Movie Study Guide, under the category called \"SEQUEL\", it says; \"Maurice Sendak has never written a sequel to his book, but for the movie studios, they say there MIGHT be a sequel.\" Please review!)[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 1: BIRTH OF WILD THING AND FIND A WAY It was spring-time on the island of the Wild Things, all seven Wild Things; Carol, KW, Douglas, Alexander, Ira, Judith, and Daniel are all inside the fortress that they all build together with their old friend and once their king name Max, however, right after Max left their island, KW told Carol that she was expecting their very first cub. Inside the fortress, KW was giving birth to her first cub, with Carol to support her by putting KW on his lap, while she pushes her baby out. \" Come on, KW, darling. You can do it. One more big push. For me.\" Carol said, giving KW some support. KW used all of her might to push her baby out. The other Wild Things were watching while KW pushes, however, Alexander covers his eyes and says, \" Oh, I can't watch.\" Then, a big pop fill the room with a gash of water on the ground, and then, all of the sudden, a baby cry fill the entire fortress, Carol and KW both looked at each other with warm smiles, they both look down and saw their beautiful baby cub on the ground, Carol picks it up in his furry arms, and looks at his cub with tears rolling down his face. Then, he takes a little look at the gender of his cub, and looks to the others and says, \" We have a beautiful baby girl.\" All of the Wild Things howled together with excitement. Carol stares at his beautiful baby girl for the first time. She has the same golden eyes as KW, auburn hair as KW, orange legs from KW, and dark and light brown stripes like Carol with a ticklish tummy, along with a pink-button nose like Carol, and two small humps which will soon grow into horns. He turns to KW with a warm smile, while KW rests her head on Carol's chest and looks at her cub with a little tired and warm smile upon her face. \" She's perfect. What are we going to name her?\" Carol asked. KW thought about it, and a smile came to her face and looks at the baby. \" Angel.\" She said. \" Yeah. I guess Angel is a wonderful name.\" Carol said, and he heard agreements from his friends with smiles upon their faces. He turns to his beautiful baby girl and says softly, \" Hello, Angel. I'm your daddy, and this is your mommy. We will take good care of you and teach you everything on how to survive, because this is a very wild place. I am sure that we will protect you and we will love you more than life itself.\" And with that, he bent down and gives Angel a kiss on the forehead. Douglas goes over to Carol and KW, and pats Carol on the shoulder to assure him that he's proud of Carol and KW, all of the sudden; the other Wild Things go over to the happy couple and give them hugs by showing them their love and support. As the months pass by, all of the Wild Things all have huts re-made, while KW was playing little Angel, Carol was making arrangements on their hut, until, one day, a memory of Max hit his mind, and causes Carol to feel a little sad on missing his best friend and their once wonderful king. He just couldn't believe that he almost ate him on the way Max lied to Carol and the other Wild Things about him being a Viking or a king, and that he's just…a boy, just a boy. Carol has been thinking about Max, and wants to know if he's going to come back to the island and see the Wild Things again, because he has not got a chance to resolve things with Max, and he wants to see Max again. KW noticed Carol's sad little face and goes over to him with Angel in her arms and about to nurse her with her arms folded. Carol looks at KW and gives her a kiss and bents down to kiss Angel till KW says, \" What's the matter?\" Carol sighed and says, \"I just been thinking about our friend; Max, and I wish I could see him again, because I miss him so much.\" \" I know. I miss him too. But he's still in our hearts.\" KW said. \" Yeah, I guess you're right about that. But I just wish we could see him again.\" Carol said and he knows exactly what to do. Then, one night, while the other Wild Things were sleeping, Carol just kept staring at the ceiling with the fire lighting up, he just kept thinking about Max, and kept thinking of a way to go see Max, he starts to close his eyes for a little sleep while thinking on how Max came to their island. After a few moments of sleep, an idea came to him. \" Since Max is from another land, and he traveled here by a small boat that took him to our island. Maybe if he could travel by a boat, we could travel by a boat too. And I think I know exactly what to do.\" He thought to himself, and then, he quietly gets up and tiptoed out of the hut without waking up the others. He goes out of the hut, and goes into the forest and picks up a lot of wood, and goes down to the beach, and he starts to build a huge big boat that will fit all Wild Things and that it will not be weak or sink. Carol has been working on making a boat for a short-time, and he also made a few rooms, Captain's quarters, a dining room and bedrooms for everyone. One room for himself and KW, one for Ira and Judith, one for Alexander, one for Douglas and his cat, and one for Daniel. He also had to make sure that the boat will float, so it will not feel weak for their weight, and gets too heavy, for the dining area, he brought lots of fruits and roots, so it will not attract sharks. Around mid-night, Carol finished with the boat and looks at it. \" Wow. Now that's what I called a very good job for a Wild Thing like me to handle.\" He said, until, his stomach starts to growl. \"Ooh. My stomach is growling, looks like I have working on this boat a bit longer than I thought. Well, since the boat is all finished, I might as well get a snack and go back to the family to get some sleep. But I have got to keep quiet, so I won't wake up the others.\" He added. Carol starts to tiptoe through the forest and goes to the island's interior and found lots of fruit trees, and he goes over to his favorite fruit tree and picks lots of apples, but he didn't take off the steam or wash them in water, but…without thinking, he puts all those apples into his big mouth, he was so hungry, and he let out a little loud burp. \" Boy that was very delicious. BBBBUUUURRRRPPPP! Oh, excuse me. Well, since I have my snack, I can go back to the family and get some sleep for the rest of the night.\" He said, and starts to head back to his hut, and get some sleep for the rest of the night, he lays down, gives KW a kiss on the forehead, starts to give Angel a little kiss on the head, and goes to sleep. Early around the next morning, Carol was still sleeping for the rest of the morning, and then, he woke up one afternoon, and he starts to go into a nice hot spring with warm water with steam coming up, he starts to relax in the hot spring while watching KW playing with little Angel, Douglas resting with his cat, Judith knocking Ira with trees, Alexander eating green grass, and Daniel sitting by a tree with his arm resting on his knee and with his eyes closed. Carol just let out a big sigh while relaxing in the hot spring, and he looks at KW with little Angel playing with a dandelion. He thought it will be fun to watch, he gets out of the hot spring, starts to shake all the water off his fur, spraying water everywhere till he was a big ball of fur with a big poof. He pushes his fur down, so he won't look like a big ball of fur, and he starts to go over to KW and Angel. For Angel, she looks up and saw her father, she uses her tiny arms to reach out to him, and so she could get picked up by him. Carol smiled at Angel, and he picks her up and holds her in his soft furry arms. KW looks up and saw Carol holding Angel, she smiled and she got up, then she spoke, \" Hello, Carol. How are you feeling?\" she asked. \" I am feeling a lot better now, thank you for asking me, my beloved. And the reason why I have slept all morning is because…well, you might think it's crazy.\" Carol said, feeling a little shy on how to tell KW that he builds a boat last night, so he could take all the Wild Things with him to go see Max. \" I won't think it's crazy at all. Try me.\" KW said, while putting a hand on Carol's shoulder to show him some comfort. \" Well, okay, if you say so…Last night, I have been thinking about Max, and…I have made a big boat that will take all of us to Max's island, so we could see Max again. The reason why is because…I believe that my bond with Max is still with me, along with Max, and it gives me the courage to tell Max that I want to apologize for trying to eat him, and that…I love him, like he's my own son. And I believe that he sees me like I'm his own father to him.\" Carol said, looking down. KW was surprised and in shocked on what Carol had said to her about him building a boat to take all Wild Things with him to go see Max, and that their bond is still with them. She thought for a good minute or two, and she starts…to smile, and gives Carol a kiss upon his cheek, and she says, \" I am so proud of you on what you said to me, Carol. And I don't think you're crazy about it either. I mean, when I was with Max while we're all sleeping a big pile, me and Max start to talk on why he come here to this island, and that he has a family, but he didn't eat them, and I believe that…I see Max like he's my own son as well, and I also believe that Max sees me like I'm a mother-figure to him. On what you just told me, I start to believe you, in every word you said.\" Carol was surprised as well on what KW said to him back, and he starts to believe in her as well, just like what she believe in him on what he told her about his idea on taking all Wild Things with them to go see Max on his island. He starts to smile and gives KW a kiss on her soft red lips, and gives Angel a kiss as well; and he spoke, \" I'm glad that you like my idea. And I bet that the boat that we're all going to ride on to get to Max will definitely work and be safe as well. Come on, let's go tell the others and see what they have to say.\" He takes KW by the hand while he was holding onto Angel in one of his arms, and they all head back to the huts, so Carol could tell everyone about his wonderful idea, so he could take all of them with him to go see Max. He's going to see Max, no matter what, and nothing is not going to stop him. (This is the first chapter that I did; Carol is my favorite Wild Thing, and if Spike Jonze, Maurice Sendak, Max Records, Tom Hanks, James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose and many more see my story, I hope they won't be too disappointed, because I am still hoping for a sequel to Where The Wild Things Are Movie to happen.)[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 2: TELL THE OTHERS AND BEING HUMAN Once Carol and KW got back to the huts, they saw everyone is outside their huts doing their things that they like to do, all of the sudden; Carol put two of his fingers into his mouth and let a big loud whistle to signal all of the Wild Things to go to him. They all heard Carol's whistle and they all go over to him. \" Alright, Carol. We all know that you did that since you have something important to tell us.\" Judith said while rolling her eyes. \" Yeah, Carol. What is it that you want to tell us?\" Alexander asked. Carol and KW both looked at each other, KW nod her head, and Carol smiled at KW and he turns to the others and said, \" Guys, I have been doing a lot of thinking, and…well….I have been thinking about our once great king and good friend; Max. However, I kept on hoping and wishing that we could all see Max on his island, because I believe that my bond with Max is still with the both of us, cause we all have a very good friendship, which gives me the courage to help me build a big boat for all of us to ride on, so we could go to Max's island and see Max again and be part of his life once again.\" Carol said. Douglas looks very surprised and he smiled at Carol and starts to believe him since Max is very close to Carol, just like Carol is to him. Ira starts to believe in Carol as well, since he doesn't know Max that well, and that Max likes the tunnels that Ira gets to make during the construction of the fortress that they all build together, and that he is very friendly to Max as well. Alexander also believe in Carol as well; since Max did apologize to Alex from getting hit by a dirt clod during the dirt clod war, and he knew that Max is not a king at all, that he's just a regular human boy, and that he believes there's no such thing as a king who can do anything that Max says, which Alexander doesn't care about it. He was also happy that he is going to see Max since Max is like a younger brother to him. Judith was a bit shocked at first, then she got her anger to calm down, and she starts to feel happy since she knows that she was being too harsh on Max for \"playing with favorites\", and that she's a downer, but deep down; she still likes Max. For Daniel, he seemed to be in thought and seemed happy about going to see Max, because since right after Max was about to leave the island, Daniel starts to talk to him, which made Max happy that Daniel can talk, however, Daniel asks Max if he's going to say good things about the Wild Things, and that Max says that he will say good things about the Wild Things, which Daniel really appreciates so much. And then, all of the sudden, he spoke, \" Hey, Carol.\" Carol looked at Daniel, feeling surprised to hear him talk. \"Yeah.\" He said. \" Since we're going to see Max, what do you want us to do for now?\" Daniel asked. Carol smiled at Daniel and goes over to him and pats him on the back that he was so happy that Daniel can still talk and he says, \" For now, we're just going to get everything we need for our journey to Max's island, and once we get everything all set, we'll be ready to get Max's island.\" All of the Wild Things all agreed about going to see Max, and they all got started on getting everything all packed for their journey. KW was picking lots of dandelions and cotton fluff to make a blanket for Angel, all of the sudden, her two owl friends; Bob and Terry came to her and squeak to her, she looked up and saw them and she waved at them and continue with her work while Carol was off taking care of Angel. Douglas picked up his cat and got his bag of everything that he need and goes over to Carol, while the others got everything going as well, and they also bring lots of fruit, roots, plants, and water for their journey. Once they all lined up behind Carol, and they all matched their way to the beach where Carol built the boat, once they all got to the beach, they were all amazed at the sight of the boat that Carol had created all by himself. They start to congratulate him, and Carol got to the wooden microphone and says, \" Okay, everybody. Now we got everything that we need, it is now time for our wonderful adventure. Now let's get going.\" They all got inside the boat with Carol steering the boat in the Captain's quarters. This is the first time that the Wild Things get to be off the island, and off to a new unknown world. Inside the rooms, KW is resting on the bed with Angel on her chest, nursing, while KW is making a dandelion fluff blanket and looking out the window and saw the blue ocean. Douglas is in his room, cuddling with his cat, and he says, \" We're going to go see Max. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, we are. We are.\" Judith and Ira are doing their best to get Alexander all calm down, which causes him to vomit out the window, and feel dizzy and panic on what's going to happen to the boat if they didn't make it to Max's island. \" What if the boat sinks? In the water, what if sharks come and eat us?\" Alexander said while still in panic mode. \" Alexander, will you please calm down? The boat will not sink, and it fits just right for our body weight, just like what Carol says, and we don't have any meat on the boat, all we got is fruits, roots, and plants, so it will not attract sharks. Please, calm down.\" Judith said, feeling tired of watching Alexander panic and vomit out the window. Daniel is resting the bed, with one of his knees up resting his arm on his knee and have his eyes closed for a little rest. Up in the Captain's quarters, Carol is steering the boat looking out into the ocean, with a blue clear sky, not a cloud in it as well with a nice bright sun. He starts to take a break from steering and studies himself in a mirror and says, \" Ooh. You look a bit scruffy there, Carol. Oh, well, a little push down on my fur, and a little combed, and…there, much better.\" Then, he continued to steer the boat. When night came, Carol parked the boat, and head down the steps to go to bed. Once he got into the room, he saw KW and Angel sleeping, he goes over to the bed, gives KW a kiss on the lips, and caresses Angel's little rosy cheek, and goes to sleep. Around the next morning, Carol woke up feeling funny, he gets out of bed, with a big yawn coming out of his mouth, he goes over to the mirror to rub the sleep dust out of his eyes, however, when he opened his eyes, he had his eyes wide open when he looked at himself in the mirror, and he realize now that he's now…a human. He had amazing tan shaped body with muscles built, brown eyes, and brown wavy hair, and he's wearing orange tank up with navy blue shorts. All over the floor are clothes everywhere. When he turned around and looked at KW and Angel, he almost flipped over when he saw KW as a human as well. For KW, she has a very beautiful tan-shaped body, with long auburn hair that matches her red pretty lips; she is wearing a red lacy as her night-gown. Angel is very cute, she has brown hair, pink rosy cheeks, when she opened her little eyes, and she has these beautiful brown eyes. When KW woke up, she looks at her body, and she almost flipped when she saw Carol as a human as well. \" Oh my goodness, Carol, you're a human.\" She said and looks at her body. \" Yeah and so is Angel. But if we're human, then that means…all of us are all human.\" Carol said, he goes out of the door and shout to everyone to wake up. \"Everybody, get out here. Wake up, everybody, wake up.\" He shouted. All the Wild Things heard Carol's shouting and they all got out of their rooms, and they realized that Carol, KW, and Angel are all human. When Carol saw everyone came out of their rooms, he was surprised to see that everyone is all human. Alexander is a bit short, he has green eyes, white skin, blonde hair, and he's wearing a white t-shirt with white shorts. Ira is very tall, he has a big nose (human size), he has grey hair, black skin, brown eyes, and he's wearing a dark grey shirt with dark grey pants. Judith is a bit shorter than KW, she has brown hair, brown eyes, white skin, and she's wearing a green lacy that covers her legs. Douglas is a bit similar to Alexander, he has white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes, and he's wearing a white shirt that covers his arms, and navy blue pants. Daniel has white skin, black hair, short in the front and long in the back, and he's wearing a black shirt with black pants. When KW and Angel came out, KW is wearing a red tank top, with a navy blue skirt, while Angel is wearing a little pink dandelion outfit. \" How did this happen?\" Douglas asked. Carol is in some thought, and something hit him on the back of his mind. \" I think I know how this happen. Wait here, everyone.\" He said, then heads upstairs to the Captain's quarters, and finds his human annual book, so he could learn more about humans. He found the page and scanned it. The page says, \"Human Change: If a Wild Thing is off its island and goes to another world, that Wild Thing will stay human for a little while and once it gets close to the new island, it will soon wear off. The Human Change will wear off in a few days.\" Carol let out a big sigh of relief and goes down and tells the others the good news. \" Good news, guys. This is called Human Change. It says it will wear off for a few days once we're getting closer to Max's island, okay? Let's get going. We got a long ride ahead of us.\" He said and goes back up to the Captain's quarters and starts the boat and steers the boat back out into the ocean for their journey to Max's island. (This is the chapter on when Carol tells everyone about going to see Max, and once they're in the ocean, they were all human and wear off in a few days. Do you believe that Max really wants to see Carol and the other Wild Things again? Please review! Thank you very much!)[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 2: BACK INTO WILD THINGS AND UNITED WITH MAX All seven Wild Things along with Angel are all getting used on being human kind-of thing since they never been human before. They have to wear clothes, eat food, and many more that a human can do. Out on the horizon in the ocean, the Wild Things saw an island far in the distance, which they believe that they're getting close to where Max lives, but they're getting close though. KW with Angel in her arms are out on the front of the boat watching the beautiful sun-set with the sun changing colors, like; red, orange, yellow, and pink. KW is wearing one of Carol's shirts which is tied close to her belly-button and her tan back. Angel is close to her mother close to her chest, and falls asleep as well. Carol came up to the front without a shirt on, just a pair of navy blue jeans, he was looking at KW at her amazing body wearing one of his shirts, he has this amazing body while showing his muscles. He goes over to her when she was about to lean on, so he lets her lean on his chest with his arms around her, and they all start to look at the beautiful sun-set together. When the sun went down, then the moon comes up, stars start to appear; KW starts to fall asleep in Carol's arms, while Carol looks at the stars and found a wishing star twinkling in the night-sky. \" Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. Wish I may, wish I might. Have the wish I wish tonight…I wish…I wish that me and our family change back into Wild Things again, and I also wish that we get to Max's island by morning, and that we could all be part of Max's life and part of his family, that way, I could be like a father to Max. Please, grant my wish, wishing star. Thank you.\" He thought to himself and closed his eyes to make his wish come true. All of the sudden; Carol picked up KW and Angel in his arms and take them to their room and get some sleep for the night. Early the next morning, Carol starts to wake up funny just like what he felt when he was turned into human, he got off the sleep dust out of his eyes and looks at the mirror, and he gasp that he's back into his Wild Thing self again, which he seems happy about it. KW woke up as well, and saw that she's Wild Thing again, and smiles at Carol, which he goes over to her and kisses her. Once Carol goes up to the Captain's quarters, he saw that everyone is back into their Wild Thing selves again, he got to the steering wheel, and starts the boat, and off to Max's island, but still getting close to Max's island though. Later, Max is sitting by the bay with his dog; Stumpy, it was summer, he has no school, which he is very glad, and his mother has no work either, because she quit her job and starts to do something else, so she could see Max and Claire every single day. It was a beautiful Friday afternoon, Max has been eating his breakfast, fool around in the back-yard with his dog, ate his lunch, and now, he's in the forest, sitting by the bay fiddling with a stick. Out on the horizon, Max could see a big boat coming close to shore, it looks like a big wooden yacht, but yachts and cargo boats don't come to this particular bay. The only boat that comes to this bay is the tiny boat that took him to the island of the Wild Things and back. The boat was getting bigger and bigger and closer and closer as it came to view, however, Max blocks the glare of the sun, which is very hot and bright, and he could make out a figure that is steering the boat. It was big, furry, has horns on its head, and looks rather familiar. Max could see it a lot better. It can't be… \" No, it couldn't be, it's impossible, no, it can't be. Couldn't be?\" Max said to himself and starts to feel shocked and starts to hide behind a bush. Once the boat came close to duck, and once the doors are open, out came Carol and the other Wild Things. Max covered his mouth, because he is afraid that he's going to scream. He knew he hasn't got a chance to resolve things with Carol, and he doesn't know on what he will do if Carol sees him or smells him. Only Carol or KW could sense his smell whenever Max is hiding, however, whenever the Wild Things weren't looking, he came out of his hiding place. The Wild Things were all shocked on seeing Max coming out of his hiding place, when Carol came to the group, he locked eyes on Max, and so did Max who locked his eyes on Carol. Stumpy starts to bark, Max got Stumpy to quiet down, which starts to sit on the ground. He continued to look at Carol, who kept staring at Max. Douglas was right all this time, Max is not a Viking or a king at all, Max is just a boy, a little boy. Carol goes over to Max with his face with a mixture of happiness, surprised, awe, and wonderment, and he spoke, \" I-it's you, it's really you.\" \" It sure is.\" Max said while looking at Carol, who starts to sniff Max. It was his smell, but only cleaner, Max was wearing some navy shorts with a white t-shirt, but it was his smell. Carol cried happy tears and bears his face on Max, and he says, \" I'm sorry that I almost eat you, I didn't know, and I'm sorry. I love you, Max. You're like a son to him.\" Max goes up to Carol and bears his face on Carol, and he says, \" It's okay, I know how you feel, my father left me and my family a long time ago.\" Carol looked at Max and saw himself. Max looked at Carol and saw himself. They were looking each other; they were looking at each other. (This chapter talks about Max and the Wild Things are united. Do you see Carol as a father-figure to Max? And do you see Max as a son-figure to Carol?) Please review![Chapter 5] Chapter 3: Meet The Family and Out For Dinner Carol and Max have been staring at each other for a long time. They were still looking at himself in a mirror, just like when you're looking at yourself in a mirror without anything that changed you with outer interest. Max just smiled and nuzzled onto Carol's soft dark and light brown fur into a big hug, Carol is like a big teddy bear who wants to be cuddled. Max looks at the other Wild Things, and saw KW; she is like a mother-figure to him, so he goes over to her with tears in his eyes and gives her a warm embrace. \" KW!\" he cried with his arms around her. \"Hello, Max. My, you have grown. This is Angel, since right you came, I was pregnant with her. She can wave now. Angel, sweetie, can you wave to Max?\" KW said, and then, Angel had a little smile and she did a wave. Max and the Wild Things all laughed at seeing Angel waved. Max then turned to Judith, because back at the island of the Wild Things; he and Judith don't get along on the way she treated him, but deep down, she still loves Max. Then, Max smiled up at Judith and gives her a hug. \" Hello, Judy.\" He said, and Judith just smiled and says, \"Hello, Max. It's so good to see you again.\" Max greets the rest of the Wild Things with happy smiles and hugs to be happy with them. They all decided to catch up at Max's place. \"We should all catch up at my place, come on, I will let you guys meet my family, anyways. Come on, Stumpy.\" He said, taking the leash of his dog, and had the Wild Things follow him into the neighborhood and into his house. \" This is called a neighborhood, which is a block filled with lots of houses and people, which they are close to each other, and they soon became your neighbors which they live next to your houses.\" He said. \"Ohh!\" All Wild Things said at the same time. They all marveled Max's house when it got closer to it. \" I was wrong about his house being funny-looking, but this looks amazing.\" Ira said while looking at Max's house. \"Thanks, Ira. I'm glad you like it. Come on, guys, I want you to meet my family.\" Max said, and got the door open, and walked inside with the Wild Things behind him. \"Hello? Anybody home? I have someone for you all to meet.\" He added while calling out to his mother and his sister. \" Hi, Maxie. I'll be out in a second.\" Max's mother called back from the kitchen. Max's sister name Claire came down the stairs, not looking up, and sat on the bottom step, texting on her cell-phone, she was wearing a tight blue jean with a light blue tank top. Max's mother came out of the kitchen, she was wearing black shorts with a red t-shirt with white sandals, and then, she walked to where Max is, until she looked up and saw the Wild Things. She starts to turn white with a very shocked look upon her face. \" M-Max? What in the world-?\" she asked while looking at the Wild Things. \"Mom, you know I have been telling stories on where I went…well…the Wild Things came…it's a long story, but it can wait, but first; let me introduce you to the Wild Things. Guys, this is my mom; Connie. Mom, say hello to the Wild Things.\" Max said. Max's mother forced a hello out of her mouth, but shook her head from almost fainted to the floor. Max's sister; Claire looked up and saw the Wild Things with her mouth a little open and eyes wide. \" Max, you were right, they are real.\" She said while staring at the Wild Things. \"Yep, and they're looking at you, eh. Guys, this is my older sister; Claire. Claire, this is the Wild Things. They will introduce themselves to you all.\" Max said and lets the Wild Things introduce themselves. \" My name is Carol, I am the leader of the Wild Things, this is my wife; KW, and our beautiful daughter; Angel. And I am also Max's best friend when we first met on our island.\" Carol said, introducing himself, KW and Angel to Max's family. \"It's nice to meet you, Carol. I say your daughter is adorable.\" Max's mother said. \"Thank you.\" KW said. \" My name is Douglas; it's a lovely to meet your acquaintance!\" Douglas said and extended his good arm for Connie and Claire to shake. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Douglas. You can call me; Connie.\" Connie said, smiling at Douglas. \"And you can call me; Claire.\" Claire said. Ira, Judith and Alexander came next; Ira gently let his hand out for both Connie and Claire to shake as well. \"We haven't formally met. It's nice to meet you; Connie, and you too, Claire. This is my wife; Judith, our adopted son; Alexander. I'm Ira.\" Ira said gently while giving Connie and Claire a smile. Connie and Claire both smile at Ira, and they believe that the Wild Things are friendly. Then, all of the sudden, Daniel the bull came up to them, and he gently shook Connie's hand and Claire's hand, and he says, \"Hello. My name is Daniel. And…I am the quiet one of the family.\" Claire smiled at Daniel, and she says, \"My name is Claire. It's nice to meet you, Daniel.\" Daniel smiled at Claire and says, \"Same to you too, Claire.\" And so, Max showed the Wild Things around his house and took them all to his room to show them everything, including on where the Wild Things going to sleep at as well. \"This is my room, I know it's not too much, and I know it's a little cleaner, but a little messy as well too. That thing that you see there; that is my laptop.\" He said, pointing to his laptop on his desk. \" What's a laptop?\" Carol asked. \"Well, it's…a thing when you press buttons to make words, and it also gives you information on anything you need to know. You could also watch videos on there as well. Oh, to know what a video is; it's like a moving picture that takes you to one picture to another with different or the same people as well.\" Max explained. KW goes over to Max with a smile and says, \"You should have changed since right after we first saw you, Max. It's been a while. What have you been up to lately?\" \" Oh, nothing much, I have no school for the whole summer, my mom quit her job and decided to do…something different, so that way she could see me and Claire every single day. My mom broke up with her boyfriend, and she's now single and not ready for another boyfriend just yet.\" Max said. \"So, anyways, what's up with you guys? Obviously a lot.\" He added and gestured to the giggling Angel. \" Well…\" Carol started. \"We re-made our huts, me and KW are married, and KW had her baby in the spring-time. Um…you know…nothing much…really.\" Max nodded and smiled up at his best friend. Later, when Max's mother is trying to decide on what to do for dinner since the Wild Things are in her home, Max had decided to go to his favorite restaurant that was only a couple blocks away. Max begged for his mom, by bowing down to her, and kissing her feet, and worshipping her on telling her that he'll do anything that she says. \" Come on, mom. Please, please, please, please, can we go out for dinner? I will anything that you say. I will clean my room, take care of the chores and I will rub your feet for it, because I love you so much. You're like a Queen to anything in this entire world. Please, can we go, please?\" Max begged his mother, which she starts on laughing and gives in as if she was reluctant. \" Oh, okay, okay, we can go.\" Connie said while laughing at Max. The Wild Things were laughing seeing this as well. Max could definitely put on a great show. \" He's starting a very great show, our king.\" Carol said while giggling. \"Wow! This guy gets things done.\" He added, while the other Wild Things were still laughing. \"Boy this is amazing.\" Ira said. \"Yeah, that is amazing.\" Judith said. \"That is true, Judith. Max is really funny, and made us laugh.\" Douglas said. For Claire, she wasn't so hot on the idea, but she decided to get used to it since it was the same place that she and her boyfriend broke up there. \" I guess I have to get used to that place, but I will go, for Max's sake.\" Claire said. \"That's the spirit, sweetie.\" Connie said and puts a hand on her shoulder. They all left for the restaurant and once they got to it, they all stepped inside. It looked to be some sort of casual dining restaurant. It smelled like pizza and pasta, a very good smell, just like when you're in Italy, and eating pizza and pasta from an Italian restaurant. They all sat down in a long booth, which is like this; KW, Angel, Carol, Max, Douglas, Connie, Judith, Ira, Alexander, Claire, and Daniel. KW gave Angel a piece of bread to occupy herself with. Angel squealed and giggled as she chewed on the piece of bread. Carol grinned and stroked his little girl's hair. He wrapped his arm around KW and she rested her head on his shoulder and they both looked at the menu together. Meanwhile, Alexander had raided the bread bowl. He had swiped every single piece of bread and deemed to eat them all. Once Alexander reached for another piece of the garlic toast, Judith caught him swiping it. \"Alex!\" she exclaimed. He dropped the piece of bread and began whistling and looking at the side while Judith just rolled her eyes. Douglas had been looking down the menu at every single item on there. He carefully read them over and analyzing cholesterol, fat, and calories, while he writes the numbers down on a napkin. Max just stifled a little laugh while covering his mouth with his hand with a smile upon his face. The Wild Things were so ignorant of the human world that it was almost too funny to watch them. KW was biting the forks, Carol had been sniffing his water glass, and Alexander was using a napkin as a blanket. It was too hilarious. All of the sudden, the waiter finally came to their table and was completely taken aback. (Who wouldn't be if you saw eight giant fuzzy…hairy things would it?) \" Um…err…what do you uh…people want to uh…order…?\" the waiter said EXTREMELY nervous. (You would be nervous too if it was your first day on the job and you had to encounter all THESE guys.) Max spoke up. \" Will you be so kind to get us an extra-large supreme pizza for our table, please? And everyone will like some cream vanilla coke soda, please.\" He said. The waiter wrote it down on his note-pad and scurried away. Max just shrugged and turned back to the group. Angel rested against her mommy and fiddled with her tiny claws. KW smiled down at her and put her in the crook of her elbow. Angel fell fast to sleep. \" Max, you said that you're going to tell me and Claire on how you met the Wild Things.\" Connie said while looking at Max. \" Oh, right. Well, as I said before; it's a long story. It all started when I run away from home after you yelled at me, I kept on running till you couldn't find me, I went to the forest, which leads me to a beach where I hear waves coming up to shore, which is when I found a tiny boat. I start to ride on the tiny boat and I was sailing out into the ocean, which I have been sailing for days all the way to about a year, until all of the sudden, I found a mysterious island far in the distance. Once I got closer to what the island is all about, it was starting to rain, because there was a storm coming from there, which at the same time, I saw light coming from up one of those cliffs. Shortly after I parked the boat to the biggest rock to tie the boat to, I start to climb up the cliffs to get to where the light is coming from. I was walking quietly, so no one could hear me, once I got closer to where the light is, I realize it was fire that was lighting up, and that's when I saw a huge furry figure throwing something, which I looked and saw a circular hut, which somehow got destroyed. Once the big furry figure came out of the dust, I saw it was a Wild Thing, and it was Carol.\" Max said and he continued on. \" I also realized there was more of Wild Things there, while KW was somewhere during that time. When I came out of hiding, Carol saw me came in smashing their houses, which somehow amazes him, and he likes the way I destroyed stuff, and it was a good technique, and says there's a spark to my work that can't be taught, which I appreciated it. I started to help Carol on smashing more huts, until Douglas, Ira, Alexander, Judith, and Daniel all stopped me, and they were about to eat me, and I told them to be still, which they all stopped and Carol came over to the group. I start to tell them that I had powers from another land from ancient times and that I show these Vikings once, and told them that the Vikings attack me and my ice fortress, and that they made me their king for 20 years. And the Wild Things made me their king, since I overheard that Carol wants everyone to be together, and I decided to help him, which is at the same time, me and Carol shared a very good bond, like he's like a father to me, and that I…like a son to him. Because on what Carol said to me was going to be a place where all the things you want to have happen would happen. And if it doesn't happen, Carol will end up eating his feet off, which I don't want him to do that. And the reason why I lied to them, including Carol is because…I was afraid that I was going to get eaten, and that I was trying to keep everyone together, but they all still love me though.\" Max said while looking at Carol, which he smiled back and pats Max on the head. Connie was surprised on what Max has been going through when he was with the Wild Things, but she did smile that both Carol and Max shared a good bond with each other, like they're father and son to each other. Later, Carol looked over at Claire who was texting on her cell-phone…again. \" Hey, Claire. What's that thing you're holding?\" he asked. \"It's called a cell-phone.\" Claire said while looking up at Carol. \"How does it work?\" he asked. \"You basically type messages to your friends or call them. You could also listen to music as well.\" Claire said. \"Amazing. I might need one of those someday.\" Carol said. Claire just scoffed. Alexander tapped his claws against the table. \"How long do we have to wait, Max?\" he asked. \"It'll come soon, Alex. Just be patient.\" Max said while rolling his eyes. Alexander groaned. Finally their food came. The Wild Things were marveled by the pizza and the vanilla coke soda. Max sliced it and flipped a piece onto everyone's plate. Carol, of course, had to inspect the new food specimen. He sniffed it and looked at it suspiciously. Claire had a smile upon her face with a little giggle and took a picture of it and posted it on her face-book of her cell-phone. (That was sure to get a laugh out of some people.) KW, however, was starved and just ate the pizza anyways. She rolled her eyes at Carol, who was really getting to be annoying. \" Carol, its fine, just eat it.\" KW said. Carol tried the pizza. His eyes lit up and he smiled and took another bite. \"Wow! That's good, Max!\" he exclaimed. Max grinned and says, \"Glad you like it.\" He said back and continued eating his pizza and drinking his vanilla coke soda. The Wild Things have never had or tried soda before, so this was definitely all new to them. Ira stared wide-eyed at the foam of the soda. \"WOOOOOOOWWWW!\" he marveled at it. Max grinned. Connie giggled. Claire had a little giggle and took another picture and posted it onto her face-book, stifling guffaws. Daniel grunted and began sipping the soda. He obscurely smiled and drank some more, and he turned to Claire, which she looked at Daniel and says, \" Is that soda taste good, Daniel?\" Daniel smiled and nodded his head, as if by saying, \"The stuff tastes so good.\" Claire smiled back and winked at Daniel, which somehow made Daniel blushed. After dinner, they all went out to get some ice cream for dessert. The Wild Things, again, had never had or tried ice cream before, so this is also all new to them as well. And Claire got pictures of it all whenever they had brain-freezes, shouting, \"AAHH! My brain hurts. Why is my brain so cold?\" And then, they finally went home. It was still early in the night-time, so Max got out his DVD box and looked around it. He finally pulled out The Pink Panther and The Pink Panther 2 and walked downstairs where everyone was on the couch and other pieces of furniture all talking about what they have experienced. Max trotted downstairs. He stuck it into the DVD player and pressed play. He quickly explained. \" This is a movie. Which is also a moving picture. So just uh…watch and enjoy the show.\" Max said and then, he hopped onto the couch and sat next to Carol. He rested his head against Carol's shoulder and Carol wrapped his soft arm around Max. The Wild Things had ended up enjoying the movie very much. They will laugh at the scenes that are funny and pretty much talked about it the whole night. Since it was only Friday, they all stayed up, except KW who had to go to bed, because of Angel. Finally, they all crashed in Max's bedroom, and they fell fast to sleep. (This chapter is when Max gets to let the Wild Things meet his family, and they all went out for dinner. I bet that the bond that Carol and Max both had shared together will grow a lot stronger. What do you say about that? Please review!)[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 5: A BOND WITH CAROL On that same night, Max woke up in his room with only KW, Angel, Ira, Judith, Alexander, Daniel, and Douglas in his room which they all are sleeping peacefully, until he didn't see Carol in his room either. \"I wonder where Carol had gone to.\" He thought to himself, and then, he got up quietly without waking up the others, and he tiptoed out of his room and went downstairs. Once he got downstairs, he went into the living room, and there…he saw Carol, sleeping on the couch. Max smiled and looked at his best friend sleeping. He starts to tiptoe towards Carol, and climbs onto the couch and lies down next to Carol without trying to wake him up from his slumber. Max starts to fall fast to sleep right on Carol's striped tummy with his arms around Carol into a hug along with a blanket to stay warm. The ceiling fan was on since it was summer-time. While Max was sleeping on Carol's tummy, Carol opened one of his eyes, and looks down and saw Max sleeping on his striped tummy; he starts to smile at his best friend and puts his arms around Max to make sure that Max doesn't fall off. He gently gives Max a kiss on the head and he whispered, \" Good night, Max. I love you, like my own…son.\" Max smiled while hearing on what Carol had whispered to him, and he whispered back, \" Good night, Carol. I love you too, like my own…father.\" Carol smiled as well, and they soon went back to sleep for the rest of the night. Later, Connie woke up and gets out of bed to make herself some warm tea, once she came downstairs, she was about to go into the kitchen to start the kettle, she paused and looked into the living room, and there…she saw Max and Carol sleeping on the couch together. She smiled, and she realized that Carol is really Max's best friend, and that Carol took good care of Max while he was on the island of the Wild Things. She sneakily went to her closet and got her some digital camera, and she softly took a picture of Carol and Max sleeping together. She smiled and went back to the kitchen once the kettle starts to beep. She pour her tea into a cup and walked to where Max is and she gives him a kiss on the head, and pats Carol on the head and she felt the fur on Carol's head as well that it feels so soft that you could just cuddle with him and give him a big hug. She whispered, \" Thank you for taking care of Max for Carol. You are truly a wonderful friend. Thank you. Good night, Carol and Max. Sweet dreams.\" And then, she went back upstairs and went to sleep. When morning came the next day, Max woke up with someone caressing his hair, it was Carol, who was sleeping with him last night, and that he just smiled and made Max smile as well. Max slowly opened his eyes and looks up and saw Carol, looking down on him. He spoke, \" Good morning, Max. I didn't wanna wake you up, but maybe you could show me around that you do on this island.\" Max smiled and says, \" Good morning, Carol. Of course I can show you everything. That's what friends are for. And we're still friends, right?\" \" Yeah. Of course, we're still friends. Nothing could separate us.\" Carol said. Max smiled and gives Carol a good morning hug, which at the same time, Carol hugged Max back. Later, Max got dressed and showed Carol everything on what Max did in his home, and around the island. While walking through the neighborhood, they all sat together by a huge oak tree to stay in the shade from the hot boiling sun. Max spoke, \" Well…since right after I came back home with my mom and Claire, I was afraid to tell my mom on where I went, but I was afraid that she thinks that I was telling stories, but I decided to tell her when you guys showed up here.\" \" Wow. And what did you do then?\" Carol asked. Max thought about it for a minute or two and then, he looked up at Carol and says, \" Since right after I came home, when I went to bed that time, I have been thinking about you guys, and I was afraid that you won't talk to me again when you said when you're about to eat him.\" Carol smiled a little, and then he took Max's hand and puts it onto his knee, and he says, \" Max, the reason why I said that I was going to eat you is because…it just slipped and that's why I said it. But…I just want us all to be together…and…I know that I didn't mean to be that way, Max. I was just scared, and that I don't know what else to do.\" Max looks up at Carol with little tears in his eyes, while Carol looks at Max with a little smile, and then, without thinking, Max wraps his arms around Carol into a tight hug, and that he really likes his best friend, and doesn't want to lose him, and doesn't want Carol not to eat him. Suddenly, they both got up, and they were standing underneath the oak tree, and Carol lets Max use one of his claws and Max craved his initial on the oak tree, and then, Carol craved his initial on the oak tree, along with a heart around it, as if by saying, \"M+C Forever.\" Max smiled and looked up at Carol, and Carol opens his arms for a hug. And then, they both howled quietly together, as if they were father and son together to show each other some love and tenderness, and their kindness as well. \" You know…I wish I could let my mom let you guys live with me and my family. But I'm not sure on what we're gonna do about that.\" Max said. \" Yeah…but I am pretty sure if I talked to your mom about it, and see what she has to say and if she will let us live with you, and I am pretty we could work something out as well.\" Carol said. Max nodded his head, and says, \" That might sound like a good idea, Carol. And you are a genius.\" Carol just looked at Max and says, \" Really?\" \" Yep, as you once told me before; I like your brain, Max. But to me, I will say; I like your brain, Carol.\" Max said with a chuckle. Carol chuckled as well, and lets Max ride on his back while Max holds onto his horns, just like what Carol did to give Max a tour of the island. And they all head back to the house safely and peaceful. (This chapter has to do with Carol and Max, it's just like they're sharing a wonderful bond with each other, just like on what they did back on the island of the Wild Things. Do you believe that Carol should talk to Max's mother about letting the Wild Things live with Max? And do you believe that Max's mother will let Carol be a father to Max on the way he treated Max back on the island of the Wild Things? Please review!)[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 6: A TALK WITH MAX'S MOTHER Once Carol and Max came home from their walk, the other Wild Things looked up and saw Carol and Max coming inside from the front door. Connie smiled and looked up at Carol and pats him on the shoulder, and she leans forward to Carol's ear saying that she wants to talk to him…alone. Carol looks at Connie with a smile and nods his head, and he followed her into the back-yard while the others were in the living room or upstairs in Max's room. Once Carol and Connie were out in the back-yard, they both sat by the bench on the back porch, while watching the sun go down. He turns to Connie and says, \" So, what do you want to talk to me about? Is something wrong?\" Connie looks at Carol and says, \"There's nothing wrong, I just want to get to know you, since you're Max's best friend, and a very good father to your daughter. Since last night, I saw you and Max sleeping together, and since right Max run away from home, and when he first saw you, I would have to say is; thank you for taking good care of him, and that you're such a very good friend to him. And that I appreciated it so much.\" \" It's no problem at all, madam. When Max came to me and the others for the first time, I start to believe that I just…saw myself inside of him, when he starts to look at me for the longest time right after we first met, and I believe that he overheard everything on what I said about keeping everyone together, as a family. After Max declared a Wild Rumpus, I start to introduce Max to the family, and that I told him that my name was Carol, and that I am the leader, and always keep everyone in track on what they were doing and that they all stay together. Then, there was Judith and Ira, they were in love, Ira is good at putting holes in trees, while Judith gets to hit Ira with tree trunks, there's Alexander, who wants attention, but don't give him the satisfaction, but he's the youngest who doesn't like being ignored, there's Douglas, who is my right hand man, and best friend, I always count him for everything. If I was stranded on a desert, I can take only one thing; it'll be Douglas. We can share him if you want.\" Carol said and he continued. \" There's KW, who is my true love, and wife, because I love her so much, but we always work on anything when it comes to our friendship, she became friends with two owls name Bob and Terry, but all I could hear is their squeaking, because I couldn't understand them on what they're saying, KW is very good on medicine whenever one of us gets sick and makes medicine on anything that her mother gets to make. There's Daniel, he's the quiet one and stands by himself, and doesn't get involved, but he doesn't talk that much. As for what we do as Wild Things or monsters, we sometimes tear trees down, and we always get to eat foods that are…chewable, because we are…carnivores, which means wild animals that eat meat, but I will never ever eat Max, but I almost ate him, because I just can't believe that he lied to me. But I don't see any problems with Max though, because he seems like a very nice kid, and that he's doing his best to keep us all together, just like what I always dreamed of.\" Carol said while looking at Connie with little tears coming out of his eyes. Connie realized on what Carol has been going through when Max came to them. When she saw the tears coming down on Carol's face, she used her thumbs to wipe the tears away from his eyes, and Carol just smiled down at Connie and gives her a warm hug to make him feel better. Connie says, \" I didn't know on what you're going through. And I believe that's what Max really dreamed of as well, about all of us staying together. I just curious; do you and the others want to stay with me, Max, and Claire? Because I bet that you're here to make Max happy, because you all missed him so much, and you all looked like a second family to him. That's why I see you as a father figure to him, while KW is like a mother figure to him as well, along with Angel, who could be like a little sister to him, along with Alexander like a brother to him too.\" Carol looks at Connie and says, \" Do you really think so?\" Connie smiled up at Carol and says, \"I do.\" Carol just blushed, and holds onto Connie's hands in his hands to feel her smooth skin on her hands. Connie just felt on how soft Carol's paws were, and she gives Carol a kiss on his cheek, which Carol just froze as if by saying, \"Oh!\" and he just smiled. And all of the sudden, Connie and Carol both walked back inside when it starts to get dark. Upstairs, in Claire's bedroom, Claire, Alexander and Daniel are having a nice chat, by talking about their-selves, so they could get to know each other a lot better. \" So, Alex, what do you do on your island?\" Claire asked. \" Well, on the island, I am good at finding trees whenever everyone is a hard time looking for the right stick that they're looking for. I sometimes want to help the others, but they always ignore me, but I don't like being ignored.\" Alexander said being a little shy on talking to a pretty girl, who is also Max's sister. \" Oh, poor Alex. It's okay for being ignored, but I know how you feel, because when I was a little girl, my parents were always busy with everything, but they don't pay attention to me, because all they talk about is Max, because my mom was pregnant with Max around that time, and they don't have time with me. So that's how I know how you feel.\" Claire said while giving Alexander a smile, who smiled back at her. Then, Claire turned to Daniel and says, \" Daniel, what do you do on your island?\" \" Well…I sometimes do little stuff with everybody whenever they need my help. But…I am usually the quiet one, because I always stay by the side and not get involved, but when Max was about to leave the island, I start to talk to him for the first time.\" Daniel said quietly to Claire. \" What do you said to Max back on the island?\" Claire asked. \" I asked him if when he goes home, I asked him if he's going to say good things about us, and…he says he is going to say good things about us. Which I feel appreciated about it. I don't talk that much.\" Daniel said. \" Wow. That's very sweet to hear that from you, Daniel. I have never met anyone like you, Daniel and Alex. I mean…you both realized on what Max has been going through, and both understand the world than anyone that I have known.\" Claire said. \" You really think so?\" Alexander asked shyly. Claire just smiled and says, \"I really do.\" And with that, she gives both Alexander and Daniel a kiss on their cheeks, which made them somehow blush. Claire just smiled and giggled and took a picture of them blushing on her face-book. \"Looks like I made two new friends.\" She thought to herself. (This chapter talks about Connie having a nice talk to Carol, and I also put Claire getting to know Alexander and Daniel a lot better. I do hope for a sequel to happen. Oh, I do, I do, I do, I do. Please review, pretty please.)[Chapter 8] *AUTHOR'S SPECIAL LETTER* Dear Mr. Spike Jonze (director), Tom Hanks (producer), Mr. Maurice Sendak and Dave Eggers (authors), Max Records (Max), James Gandolfini (Carol), Lauren Ambrose (KW), Paul Dano (Alexander), Catherine O'Hara (Judith), Forest Whitaker (Ira), Chris Cooper (Douglas), and Michael Berry, Jr.(Daniel) (actors) , My name is Rochelle Norlund, but I love to be called; Chelle. I just want to say to you all is; I do like the live action movie of Where The Wild Things Are, because it all looks similar to the book that Maurice Sendak had written a long time ago, including the one that Dave Eggers had written as well. During the whole movie, when I first saw it, I was completely shocked to see that the Wild Things look like GIANTS, like when we're on the island of the Wild Things, we get to meet them, talk to them, hug them, tackle with them, and sleep in a GIANT Wild Thing Sleeping Pile, which somehow made me very impressed with everything that you all did together as a happy family. In WTWTA, I bet that I can picture James Gandolfini and Max Records had a very good friendship in all the scenes that has to do with Carol and Max, however, not to make you all think that I am crazy; I start to believe that Carol could be like a father-figure to Max, KW could be like a mother-figure to Max, while Max could be like a son figure to Carol and KW, because I also believe that the Wild Things could all be like a second family to Max, it's just in the story called James and the Giant Peach, when a young boy name James gets to go inside a giant peach and meet these giant bugs, which they all like a second family to James, since his mother and father were killed by an evil rhinoceros and was raised by his two mean and nasty aunts; Sponge and Spiker. However, there's another reason why I am writing this special letter to you all is; well…I am hoping for a sequel to happen, because I bet that if everyone loves the movie of WTWTA, I bet they're hoping for a sequel as well, because I want to find out on what will happen to Max, if he's going to back to the island of the Wild Things or not, and what will happen to Carol, if he's going to have a chance to apologize to Max for trying to eat him, and if he wants to see Max again. Well, if you're all still thinking of a sequel to WTWTA, here's what I think you all should do; If you all go to .net, go to search and type Where The Wild Things Are 2, which is my story and idea for a sequel to WTWTA, that way you all will think of some ideas on what to do for a sequel. I hope I didn't rush you all into things, because I am just hoping and praying for a sequel to happen, because you all did a wonderful job on the movie, because I do like on where the movie takes place, the designs of each scene, and the giant Wild Thing Suits, I would say that you should give WTWTA a chance since it didn't do so well on the box-office. But I always give WTWTA movie credit, because I believed and hoping for the best to happen. Maybe, just maybe…you could use my story as a screenplay for the sequel of WTWTA, and you could get the same voice actors to do the voices of the Wild Things, like James Gandolfini as Carol, Lauren Ambrose as KW, Paul Dano as Alexander, Chris Cooper as Douglas, Catherine O'Hara as Judith, Forest Whitaker as Ira, and Michael Berry, Jr. as Daniel. What do you say? I hope you all will like my story for a sequel to WTWTA, because I will always believe. As KW will say, \"Don't go…I'll eat you up, but I love you so.\" And as Max will say, \"LET THE WILD RUMPUS START!\" Thanks, From a very good fan of Where The Wild Things Are Movie, Rochelle Norlund.[Chapter 9] CHAPTER 7: BE PART OF MAX'S LIFE When night came again, Max, his family and the Wild Things were all sitting by the table, having dinner together. They were having a big steak, with baked potatoes, corn, and dinner rolls, and for dessert is a double chocolate fudge cake, which this is all new to the Wild Things. They all sat down, say their grace and dig in on their peaceful meal. When the Wild Things saw the meat on the table, they all ate very fast like they're wild animals. After their dessert, Max looks up at Carol, who is sitting right next to him on the table, and who is also looking at Connie by asking her if she could let the Wild Things live with Max, and let them be part of his life, and they're getting used to the human world for the first time. \"Since right after what Max had told me on what he's going through for his life since right after he left the island, Max had asked me if we could all live with Max, including you and Claire. Because I could see that your daughter is getting to know Alexander and Daniel, Judith and Ira liked on what you all had, the same goes for Douglas, and as for KW and Angel, they both like the view that you all have around the house.\" Carol said to Connie. \" Oh, really? What about you, Carol?\" Connie asked. Max looked up at Carol with a little smile. \"Well, for me, I like…everything, including Max as well. Because one time, he took me to a very special place where he always has time to think to himself. The reason why he took me to that place is he told me that he has been thinking about me and everybody, and kept hoping that I will come to this island and see him again. I like him like he's my own son, just like I like Angel, who is my beautiful daughter. The other reason why is that is because, well…I believe that the bond that Max and I had shared together is still within us, because Max is my best friend, just like Douglas is my right hand man and best friend.\" Carol said. Douglas just smiled at Carol, and so did Max smiled at Carol, and pats him on the leg, which Carol looks down at Max with a smile, and puts a soft arm around Max's shoulder into a hug. KW just smiled at Carol, Connie, and Max now having a very special bond, and she gives Carol a kiss on the cheek, which made Carol blushing and smiles at KW back and kisses her back. Judith just made a little face while sticking her tongue out as if by saying, \"PLAH!\" Ira just smiled at that sweet touching moment, while Alexander smiles at Max who is still getting along with his mother, and still best friends with Carol and says, \"I say this is a very sweet touching moment, but…Connie, are you going to let us live with you, along with Max and Claire?\" Max and Claire both looked at their mother and nodding their heads, as if by saying, \"Yes, please, mom?\" Connie looked at Max and Claire, and then she looked back to the group of the Wild Things, and looks at Carol for the longest time, just like what Max did before back on the island of the Wild Things when he told them that he's a king with magical powers. She thought about it for a minute or two, and she starts to…smile, and looks at Alexander and gives him a kiss on the cheek, which causes Alexander to blush, and says, \" Yes, I will let all of you live with us, and you all such a wonderful job on taking care of Max when he's with you guys on your island.\" Max and Claire just looked at their mother, and go over to her and give her a hug and they both said, \" Thank you, mom.\" Then, Max looks up at Carol and goes over to him and gives him a big hug, and Claire goes over to Daniel and Alexander and gives them a hug as well. Max also looks at Douglas, KW, Angel, Judith and Ira, and gives them a hug as well by welcoming the Wild Things to his family. He also gives Angel a kiss on the forehead, which both Carol and KW smiled and they both looked at each other and smiled, and they lean forward to get ready for a kiss. All the Wild Things, including Max, Claire, and Connie saw Carol and KW kissing, and they all said, \" Awwwwwwwww!\" When Carol and KW were finishing kissing, they all looked at the others, which they just saw them kissing, and then, they start to blush in their faces. Max smiles up at Carol, and goes over to him and sits on his lap while Angel is in KW's arms. Connie smiled at that moment, and she sneakily goes to her closet and grabs her digital camera, and took a picture of Max with Carol along with KW and Angel. And she smiled, and she looked up at Douglas with a smile, and she says, \" This is my digital camera; it helps me take pictures of special moments to keep as for memories.\" Douglas just nods his head with a smile, as if by saying, \"Ahh!\" Connie looked at the rest of the group with a smile, watching the sweet touching moment that made Max so happy that he is so happy to be with Carol again. \"My sweet Max, so happy being with his best friend again after for so long.\" She thought to herself. When everyone go to bed that night, Max decided to sleep on the couch with Carol, so KW could use his bed to sleep on. He got himself all tucked in on the couch while Carol is still sleeping, however, the shocking part is; Daniel is sleeping on one of the furniture and all of sudden, Claire got out of her bed and goes downstairs and sleeps right next to Daniel. Max opens one of his eyes and saw his sister sleeping next to Daniel; he just smiled and realized that his sister really likes his friends, and then he goes back to sleep while using one of Carol's arms as a soft pillow. In the background, Connie saw Claire sleeping right next to Daniel and she used her digital camera and took another picture of that sweet touching moment, just like what she did with Carol and Max sleeping together as well, and goes back to bed. (This chapter talks about Connie now lets the Wild Things be part of his life and live with the family. I wonder what it be like for the Wild Things to sing if they're into music, what do you think? Please review!)[Chapter 10] CHAPTER 8: A VERY SPECIAL SONG TO SING The Wild Things were all sitting on the back porch looking at the nice view of the house, and all of the sudden, they heard something that is coming from inside the house. \" Hey. What's that special sound that I'm hearing?\" Carol asked, listening to the sound. \" I don't know, but I heard it too.\" Ira said. \" It sounded like someone or something is singing.\" Douglas said. \" It sounded so nice. I wish we could sing just like that.\" Alexander said. \" Let's go check it out.\" Judith said, and then, when they are about to go inside, but what came outside to be with the Wild Things; Max, along with Connie and Claire. They were singing to a Country Music song called LIFE IN A NORTHERN TOWN, singed by Sugarland, Jake Owen and Little Big Town. The Wild Things were all amazed by their singing and they seemed to enjoy it, and watch them sing. Once the song ended on the CD player, the Wild Things start to cheer, and Max, Connie, and Claire looked at the Wild Things cheering, and they start to take a bow. \" Wow. We didn't know that you all could sing. That was very good.\" Carol said, congratulating Max and his family. \" Yeah, it all sounds very good and wonderful.\" Alexander said with a smile. \"Hey, we're only doing it for something like a…competition. And that competition is called The Talent Competition that is taken place in town. And…we were all wondering if you all want to join us, and we could all sing together. Would you guys like to join us, please?\" Max and Claire asked at the same time. \" Kids.\" Connie said with a little surprised look upon her face. The Wild Things were all like…speechless, and they just don't know what to say. Carol start to say, \" I…uh…that's very nice of you two to say that to us. For me; if I do anything for a good friend of mine, I would be honored to join in. But, I'm not that good at singing, but I will give it a try.\" Max and Claire smiled up at Carol and give him a hug in both of his arms. Douglas patted their backs, as if by saying, \"I will like to join.\" The others all came over to Max, Claire hugging Carol still and they all did a group hug, as if by saying, \"We will like to join you as well. Because we're family.\" Connie smiled at the moment, and she sneakily took her digital camera from her pocket and took a picture of Max, Claire and the Wild Things in a group hug and says, \"Aww!\" \" So, when is the Talent Competition?\" Judith asked. \" It's on next Saturday.\" Claire said. \"Not to worry, we still got plenty of time to get ready, we just have to practice our song, and we'll be ready to win first prize.\" Max said. \"It's also a family group for each talent, and I thought singing might be a very good talent for all of us. And I am sure you all are good singers too.\" Connie said. \"Well, I suggest that we should join them, and see what we can do, and hopefully we'll win first prize. Right, guys?\" Carol said to the other Wild Things. \"Yeah, I think that's a wonderful idea, since we're all in a family and all part of their lives.\" Douglas said. \"That's the spirit, everybody. Let's get started.\" Carol and Max said at the same time, which they both looked up with surprised looks upon their faces on what they both said together, and they both smiled. \" So, uh, what song you all were singing?\" Alexander asked nervously. \"The song is called Life in a Northern Town, which is a Country Music song that is singed by two groups called Sugarland and Little Big Town, and Jake Owen, it's a very good song, and it's also singed by an 80's group called Dream Academy. They singed that song from a long time ago.\" Connie said. \"Ohh.\" All Wild Things said together. \"That sounds wonderful.\" KW said. \"It does sound incredible, right.\" Ira said. \"Wow. Looks like we're all in for a competition. Max, since you and your family told us all about it, I think you should teach me on how to sing, so all of us could get better. What do you say?\" Carol said, looking at his best friend. \" Anything for a good friend of mine, and yes, I will help you with singing, Carol. That's what friends are for.\" Max said with a smile while looking up at Carol. \"I will teach you how to sing too, KW. And you too, Alexander, and Daniel.\" Claire said, looking at Alexander, KW, and Daniel. \" That will be nice.\" Alexander said, feeling shy. \"Thank you for teaching us how to sing, Claire.\" KW said nicely. \"I will love to sing, and thank you for asking me, Claire.\" Daniel said quietly. \"And I will teach Douglas, Ira and Judith how to sing too.\" Connie said. \"Thank you, Connie.\" Douglas said. \"Yeah, thanks.\" Judith said. \"I bet you will sound wonderful, Judy.\" Ira said to Judith. \"Yeah.\" Judith said while looking at Ira. When the week went on, and when Saturday came, Max, his family and the Wild Things were all getting ready for the Talent Competition that is taking place in town, and whoever wins first place will win $20,000 and a magnificent trip to anywhere around the world for that special family. It was the big night for the Talent Competition, and Max, his family and the Wild Things were all on stage, getting prepared. Right after the next few contestants were finished with their talents, and now…it's their turn to do their talent. \" Our final contestants are: Max Records with his mother, sister, and his second family; The Wild Things.\" The Announcer said and the audience start to cheer when the lights start to go a little low, when the green lights and pink lights start to show on the stage and the music starts to play. Connie: A Salvation Army band played/And the children drank lemonade/And the morning lasted all day, all day. Douglas and KW: And through an open window came/Like Sinatra in a younger day/Pushing the town away, away. Chorus: AH-HEYA MA MA MA, INTO THE NIGHT-AHH/HEY-AH MA MA MA, HEY-AY-AY-AY, AH Carol: Life in a northern town Chorus: AH HEY MA MA MA MA Carol: They sat on the stony ground/And he took a cigarette out/And everyone else came down to listen.

And he believes that he won the winner. He goes onto the stage and goes to the microphone and says, \" Alright, that is quite a show and a very good performance. And I would say that we just found our winner, and please give a wonderful applause to Max Records, his family, and the Wild Things.\" All the people start to clapped for them, and they give Max the trophy, and $20,000, and passports to a magnificent trip to anywhere around the world. Max was very happy, and he turned his head around and looks up at Carol, who just smiled at him, and Max just smiled back at Carol. And all of the sudden, Max, his family and the Wild Things all howled with excitement, after the competition is over, they all head out for some ice cream to celebrate, and after that, they all head back home. But…on the ride back home, Max starts to fall asleep, Carol starts to carry Max and puts him on the couch, and he starts to lay down on the couch with Max, without thinking, Carol leans down to Max's head, and gives him…a kiss on his forehead, and they soon fall fast to sleep. (This chapter here, I put a song to it, which is called Life in a Northern Town, singed by Sugarland, Jake Owen, and Little Big Town, if you're all fans to Country Music that is. Please review!)[Chapter 11] CHAPTER 9: TALKIN' ABOUT MEMORIES AND NEWS Around late in one morning, Connie got out of bed and she was about to start on making breakfast, when she got to the kitchen, she saw Max and the Wild Things in the back-yard having a nice chat. She is hearing talking about memories on what Max did with the Wild Things on what he can remember. \" Oh, Carol? Do you remember when you bumped your head on a tree branch when you're about to show me on what you're doing?\" Max asked looking up at Carol. \" Oh, yeah. I do remember that. But what I was doing back then was; I was trying to catch that tree branch with my mouth, but I know I accidentally bumped my head on the tree branch and made me fall hard to the ground making a huge dust cloud.\" Carol said with a laugh. The other Wild Things were laughing on hearing on what Carol had said about him bumped his head on a tree branch. Connie just giggled watching that moment and kept on watching. \" HA HA HA HA, very funny, guys. But, yeah, that was very funny.\" Carol said. \"Yep, it sure is funny. I do remember we all helped each other building a fortress, and how we had a dirt clod war, which it was kind-a fun, but there were lots of good stuff that we all did together, like sleeping in a big pile and tackle with each other, that was very fun.\" Alexander said. \" So, Max. Since right after you left us, what did you do after you got home?\" Ira asked. \" Well, Ira. I know I told Carol this once, but I will tell the rest of you guys. It all started after I first came home from the boat that took me to see you guys. Once I came through the front door, my mom saw me came in, she ran over to me, and we embraced for a long time, and she give me food, because I was hungry. Once I was finishing eating, my mom starts to fall asleep, and I decided to go to bed as well, because I was so tired from my long journey. However, the thing is; while I was in my room, laying down on my bed, I have been…thinking about you guys, because I know I missed you guys so much, and you guys are all like a second family to me. Since then, I have been helping my family a lot and do my best on anything, just like what we did our best to build the fortress. As the months went by, I just kept been thinking about you guys, and that I want to see you guys again, and kept hoping and praying that you guys will come and see me, just like what I did to see you guys from before. Well, that pretty much on what I did until you all showed up.\" Max said, and he swallowed his gut so he won't show any sadness in his voice. Carol goes over to Max and puts an arm around his shoulder to give Max some comfort on everything on what Max had told Carol, and on what Max had told the other Wild Things. The other Wild Things just give Max a small smile to show him their comfort, Max looked at them and Carol gratefully and he smiled as well. \" Oh, Max.\" Carol said with open arms, and lets Max into his arms, and let him cry on his shoulder. Max tries to fight back the tears, but let them fall right onto Carol's soft fur, and Max starts on sobbing. \"Shh, shh, shh, it's okay, Max. It's okay.\" Carol whispered to Max while caressing Max's head. The other Wild Things now realized on what Max has been going through since right he left the island, and how much he really missed his friends so much. And then, Carol starts to sing… Sorry/Is all that you can't say/Years gone by and still/Words don't come easily/Like sorry/Like sorry/Forgive me/Is all that you can't say/Words don't come easily/Like forgive me/Forgive me/But you can say baby/Baby can I hold you tonight/Maybe if I'd told you the right words/At the right time/You'd be mine/I love you/Is all that you can't say/Years gone by and still/Words don't come easily/Like I love you/I love you/But you can say baby/Baby can I hold you night/Maybe if I'd told you the right words/At the right time/You'd be mine/Baby can I hold you tonight/Maybe if I'd told you the right words/At the right time/You'd be mine… Inside the house, Connie just overheard Carol singing, and she starts to smile on how much she loved his singing voice, and made her and her heart smile. And then, she goes over to the stove and starts to cook breakfast for everybody. Once breakfast is all ready, the Wild Things and Max all head back inside, and they all sat down by the table and the Wild Things just marveled at the breakfast, which is eggs, toast, bacon, orange juice, and cinnamon rolls, this is all new to them, just like the pizza and ice cream from before their arrival. At the table, Connie looks at Carol eating breakfast, and she realized that she saw white frosting on Carol's chin, and she starts to laugh. \" What's so funny?\" Carol asked. \"You got white frosting on your chin, Carol.\" Connie said with a giggle. Carol looks down at his chin and saw the white frosting on his chin, and then, he uses his tongue to lick the frosting off his chin and looks down at Connie. \" That's better. Um, I heard you singing, Carol.\" Connie said while drinking her coffee. \" Oh, you did? Well, uh, I guess I just learned it from Max when you're all singing for the competition, and I just didn't know I had it in me.\" Carol said, feeling bashful. \" Max is lucky to have a good friend like you. Oh, speaking of the competition, I heard that the competition is still on, and it's going to be on…next Friday, and this time, it's going to be in…individually.\" Connie said. \" Y-you mean, by doing it…separately?\" Alexander asked. \" That's right. But not to worry, we still got plenty of time for the next competition. However, there's two competitions, one is the group singing competition, and the second one is individual, and you all still got plenty of time to do a song on what you like to sing. And…whoever wins the two competitions, will get to win $20,000 and will get to go on an amazing trip to anywhere around the world.\" Connie said. \" Wow. You all really wanna do this?\" Carol asked, feeling speechless. \" Yeah. That will be amazing.\" Judith said. \" I think we'll win those two competitions.\" Douglas said. \" Alright, let's do it.\" Connie said. \"YEAH!\" Max and the Wild Things all said at the same time. (This chapter talks about when Max and the Wild Things were talking about some good times on the island, and I put a song for Carol to sing, which is called: Baby Can I Hold You, singed by Tracy Chapman. Please review and tell me what you think, please.)[Chapter 12] CHAPTER 10: THE COMPETITION As the days passed for Max, his family and Wild Things, and the competition was getting closer and closer as it seemed. They all each practiced singing their songs on what they're going to sing in the competition, so they could be able to win that $20,000 and a marvelous trip to anywhere around the world. When Friday came, the competition took place at the Coliseum in town, and there are lots and lots of people there. Once the announcer came to the stage, everyone went quiet and says, \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second part of this wonderful singing competitions.

Please review, please, please, please review!)[Chapter 13] CHAPTER 11: GOING FISHING WITH CAROL Since right after the singing competitions were over, Max had decided to take Carol to the lake when he goes fishing with his dad before. Once they got to the lake, Carol was amazed at the sight of the beautiful lake. \" Wow. This place is beautiful.\" He said while admiring the beautiful sight of the lake. \"Yeah, my dad found this place once when me and my dad were about to go fishing to catch some fish to bring the fish home for dinner. However, I do remember is; whenever me and my dad go fishing, my dad always this song once, and it goes like this… You know a dream is like a river/Ever changin' as it flows/And a dreamer's just a vessel/That must follow where it goes/Trying to learn from what's behind you/And never knowing what's in store/Makes each day a constant battle/Just to stay between the shores/And, I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/Like a bird upon the wind/These waters are my sky/I'll never reach my destination/If I never try/So I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/Too many times we stand aside/And let the waters slip away/'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow/Has now become today/So don't you sit upon the shoreline/And say you're satisfied/Choose to chance the rapids/And dare to dance the tide/Yes, I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/Like a bird upon the wind/These waters are my sky/I'll never reach my destination/If I never try/So I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/There's bound to be rough waters/And I know I'll take some falls/But with the good Lord as my captain/I can make it through them all/Yes, I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/Like a bird upon the wind/These waters are my sky/I'll never reach my destination/If I never try/So I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/Yes, I will sail my vessel/'Til the river runs dry/'Til the river runs dry. Carol just smiled on the song that Max was singing, and he pats Max on the shoulder and says, \"That is a beautiful song that your dad sang, it's lovely. I will have to say this lake is very beautiful.\" \" Yeah. So, let's go fishing.\" Max said, and they got to the boat and they all sailed into the lake, and found a perfect spot to go fishing. Once they stopped the boat in the middle of the lake, Max toss the line of his fishing pole into the lake, while Carol did the same, but this time with a big fishing hook, a big piece of rope tied to the end of a long stick, and toss it out into the lake. When Max saw what Carol did with his pole, he just giggled that Carol just used a stick as a fishing pole. They waited for a little while for fish to come, until all of the sudden, something caught on the end of Carol's line. \" Whoa! I got one.\" He said, and pulls his line as hard as he can, and then, he got a very big fish, which is big, just like Carol, and it was blue. \"Wow! You got a big blue sea bass.\" Max said, and then, the end of his line got something as well. \"Holy Smokes! I got one too.\" He added, and wined by his line, until he got a medium size blue fish. Carol looked at Max and laughed, and says, \"Wow, you got a medium size fish, but there's plenty more fish in the lake. Alright, you catch fish that side, I'll catch fish on this side. See you can catch fist fast, okay?\" Carol said. Max looks up at Carol and says, \"Okay.\" Then, Carol says, \"Go!\" And they all start on catching more fish in the lake on who could do it the fastest. Max had caught some many sized fish in all colors and sizes, and for Carol, he caught so many kinds of fish in all shapes, sizes and color. When the sun was about to go down, they put all the fish into the big cooler to keep all the fish in, and they start their way back home. \"Phew! Looks like we got a lot of fish today, right, Max?\" Carol said. \"Yep. We sure did. I bet that everyone is going to go crazy when they see the sizes of all the fish, but I bet that they're going to love us.\" Max said. \"Yeah, let's get home, so we could have fish for dinner.\" Carol said, and they all head back to the house with lots of fish to fry. On the way home from fishing, Carol had a song in his mind that made him that he wants to sing, so he singed softly… There's so many things/I didn't say/And even though/It may be too late/I want you to know/I still love you so/Evert car I meet/Looks like your car/Every movie I see/You play the leading part/You're on my mind/Can't leave you behind/When I close my eyes/You're all I see/In the dark of night/You're in my dreams/Throughout the day/You're easy to find/You're always there/When I close my eyes/In my mind I know/You're far away/But here in my heart/Nothing has changed/I'm still holdin' you/Like I used to/On a busy street/In a crowded room/Wherever I go/It's just me and you/Together again/Girl it never ends/When I close my eyes/You're all I see/In the dark of night/You're in my dreams/Throughout the day/You're easy to find/You're always there/When I close my eyes/You're always there/WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES! They got back to the house with lots of fish, when Connie, Claire, and the other Wild Things looked up; they saw Carol and Max with lots of fish in their hands. \"Dinner is here!\" Max said. \"WWWWOOOOWWWW!\" The Wild Things, Connie, and Claire said at the same time when they go to the cooler and saw all the fish that both Carol and Max had caught from their fishing trip to the lake. They ate all the fish, and then, Carol let out a big and loud burp. \"BBBBBBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!\" Everyone just stared at Carol with mouths wide-opened when Carol just had his paw on his mouth that he let out a big and loud burp, he start to blush and says, \"Oops. Excuse me.\" Then, there was laughter, and it was from KW, she believes it was funny when Carol made a burp. \"You're funny, Carol, hahaha.\" Carol just smiled and gives KW a kiss on the cheek and KW kissed him back on the cheek as well. \"You're really funny, Carol. That was good one.\" Connie said. \"Thanks. Man, I'm stuffed.\" Carol said rubbing his stomach. \"Me too. I ate like a bull.\" Daniel said. \"Daniel, you are a bull.\" Claire said. \"Oh, yeah.\" Daniel said. \"Boy, that fish is very delicious. I couldn't even eat another bite.\" Judith said. \"Me neither, Judy.\" Ira said. \"Same here.\" Alexander said. \"I agree on that one. Thanks for bringing dinner, Carol. And you too, Max.\" Douglas said. \"You're welcome.\" Carol and Max said at the same time. While everyone was sleeping, Carol looks out at the window of the night sky with a full moon, in the living room; Max was sleeping on the couch, and then, Carol starts to sing softly and goes over to where Max is sleeping and starts to caressing his hair with his paw; Maybe I took for granted you'd be around/To pick me up on my way down/I thought my feet were planted firmly on the ground/'Til one day my whole world came unwound/Like a ball of yarn kept neatly on a spool/You held the life together of this broken hearted fool/And what once was the exception…now seems to be the rule/And there's a burnin' question on a fire in my mind/You always had the answers to the ones I couldn't find/So all I'm askin' is/Where are you now/What father time would sell me I'd take it all/If only you'd be back around/But better times expel me who am I to take the call/But there's no way of knowin' where I'm bound/So here it comes another fine mess I've gotten to/And if I knew which way to turn I'd still turn to you/So if everything is said and done what am I supposed to do/That's the burnin' question on a fire in my mind/You always had the answers for me time after time/So all I'm askin' is/Where are you now/All I'm askin' is/WHERE ARE YOU NOW! After Carol sang the last words, he starts to lay down on the couch and goes to sleep right next to Max to keep Max warm from getting frost-bite, and Max starts to put his head on Carol's shoulder while Carol puts his arms around Max and they both to fall asleep. (This chapter talks about Carol and Max going fishing, and I put three songs that both Carol and Max get to sing, they are called; The River, singed by Garth Brooks, When I Close My Eyes, singed by Kenny Chesney, and Where Are You Now, singed by Clint Black. This is what I called; Father and Son Moment. Please review!)[Chapter 14] CHAPTER 12: A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT WITH CONNIE & CAMPING Around three o'clock in the morning, Connie woke up in her bed, because she wants to make sure that both Max and Claire are both doing alright. When she first went downstairs, she checked on both Max and Claire, and they were still sleeping with Carol and Daniel on some pieces of furniture. She just let out a sigh of relief that both her kids were doing fine, and so she go to the kitchen to make herself some tea, however, she saw KW who is already up nursing little Angel with arms folded. \" Good morning, KW. I see you're already up.\" She said coming into the kitchen. KW looked up and saw Connie. \" Good morning, Connie. I am just in here feeding Angel. She was crying, and I didn't mean to wake you up.\" KW said. \"Oh, it's alright, KW. You're fine. I just know exactly on how you feel. Everything's fine. Can I get you anything?\" Connie said. \"Oh, a cup of tea will be nice.\" KW said. \"Coming right up.\" Connie said and starts the kettle and took out two cups. She starts to sit down at the table and looks at Angel in KW's arms. \" Your daughter is still very adorable. She's cute.\" She said. \"Thank you. She is mine and Carol's first cub.\" KW said. \"When was she born at?\" Connie asked. \"She was born in the spring-time.\" KW said. \"I had Max in the spring-time while I had Claire in the winter.\" Connie said. \"Ah. I saw Max and Claire sleeping with Carol and Daniel when I first came in here.\" KW said. \"Yep, I saw them as well. I think that is a very sweet touching moment with a boy, a girl along with their Wild Thing. That's why I took a picture of them with my digital camera.\" Connie said. \"Aw! That way you will have for memories.\" KW said, and she starts to sing softly… Don't lose your way/With each passing day/You've come so far/Don't throw it away/Live believing/Dreams are for weaving/Wonders are waiting to start/Live your story/Faith, hope, and glory/Hold to the truth in your heart/If we hold on together/I know our dreams will never die/Dreams see us through to forever/Where clouds roll by/For you and I/Souls in the wind/Must learn how to bend/Seek out a star/Hold on to the end/Valley, mountain/There is a fountain/Washes our tears all away/Words are swaying/Someone is praying/Please let us come home to stay/If we hold on together/I know our dreams will never die/Dreams see us through to forever/Where clouds roll by/For you and I/When we are out there in the dark/We'll dream about the sun/In the dark we'll feel the light/Warm our hearts, everyone/If we hold on together/I know our dreams will never die/Dreams see us through to forever/As high as souls can fly/The clouds roll by/For you and I Connie smiled while pouring the tea into the two cups and they both sipped their tea enjoying their wonderful moment. And then, they both went back to bed for the rest of the morning. When Connie woke up with a bright sunlight, she saw the Wild Things in the living room having a wonderful peaceful breakfast. Carol looked at Connie with a smile, and using his eyes as if by telling her, \"May I have a word with you…alone?\" Connie smiled and nods her head, and saw Carol getting up from his spot and they both head out the front door to take a little walk. While they were walking, Carol says, \" Connie? Max told me if it's okay to go out camping. Max also told me that the lake that we went to go fishing, it will be a perfect spot to go camping.\" Connie seemed surprised and she looks up at Carol with a smile, and then, she sneakily starts to hold onto his soft paw. Carol seemed shocked when he felt Connie's hand in his paw, and then, he uses his thumb to feel Connie's hand. \"I think camping is a wonderful idea, Carol. I mean…we didn't go camping in a long, long time.\" Connie said while looking up at Carol. \"Really?\" Carol asked. \"Yeah…the reason why we didn't go camping in a long, long time is because…well, it reminds me on how Max and his father always go camping while me and Claire always have the whole house, and that Max always brings in snakes or some other animals into the house, which is a little freaky. But I know you're an animal, and you seemed more like a human as well, but I like you for who you are.\" Connie said. Carol just smiled, and gives Connie a kiss, and he starts to sing… I'm gonna change my ways of doin' things around here/I'm turning over a new leaf, gonna get myself in gear/'Cause I've got a woman who's better then most/And I've made a mess of her plains/Starting today, all I'm gonna be is her man/'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter/Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter/I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures/I'm even more than I can stand/But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man/I'm gonna give it all back, cause all I've done is take/Well I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make/But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me/A second chance again/And startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man/'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter/Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter/I've been misadventures, I've even got pictures/I'm even more than I can stand/But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man/I'm a little bit late but I'm wisin' up/Now I'm takin' her by the hand/And startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man. Connie just smiled and then, she gives Carol a kiss on the lips, which somehow made Carol very surprised, and then, Carol starts to smile, all of the sudden, they start to walk back to the house. Around the weekend, they all went to the lake to go camping; however, Carol and Max go to the boat and starts fishing to get some fish for the dinner. When night came, they all ate their dinner, and then, Carol says, \" Hey, Douglas, Ira, Alexander, and Daniel. Do you remember we always get to sing a song around the camp-fire? Because I remember the song.\" Carol said. \" Oh, yeah, Carol. I do remember that. But what does the song go?\" Ira asked. \" Huh, I think it goes like this…We're your friends, we're your friends, we're your friends to the bitter end.\" Carol said. \"Ah, I remember that song. That song is called That's What Friends Are For.\" Douglas said. \"Oh, so that's the song.\" Carol said. \"How about us four sing that song, for Max's sake?\" Alexander asked. Daniel nodded his head, and then, Carol said, \"Okay. Hey, fellas…are we his friends?\" And then, they all singed their camp-fire song… Douglas, Ira, Alexander, Daniel: We're your friends/We're your friends/We're your friends to the bitter end. Carol: To the bitter end. Alexander: When you are alone Carol, Douglas, Ira, and Daniel: When you are alone Douglas: Who comes around? Carol, Ira, Alexander, Daniel: Who comes around? Alexander: To pluck you up Carol, Douglas, Ira, and Daniel: To pluck you up Douglas: When you are down Carol, Alexander, Ira, and Daniel: When you are down Alexander: And when you're Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Ira, and Daniel: Outside, looking in/Who's there to open the door? Carol: That's what Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Ira, and Daniel: That's what friends are for!/Who's always eager to extend/A friendly claw?/That's what friends are for!/And when you're lost in dire need/Who's at your side at lightning speed?/We're friends of every creature/Comin' down the pike/In fact we never met an animal/We didn't like, didn't like Carol, Douglas, Alexander, and Daniel: So you can see/We're friends in need/And friends in need/Are friends indeed/We'll keep you safe/In the jungle forevermore Ira: That's what friends are for! KW, Judith, Claire, Max, and Connie all clapped for their performance, and all of the sudden, Carol, Ira, Douglas, Alexander, and Daniel all took a bow together for their performance. Carol starts to sit right next to Max, and looks down at Max with a smile, and then, Max just puts his head on Carol's knee and rests his eyes for a while, Carol smiled, and rubs Max's back and caresses his hair. And then, Carol looks up at the night sky and saw the same wishing star twinkling in the sky. \"Thank you for granting my wish, and now I can be with Max forever. This is like the best life that I ever had. Thank you.\" Carol thought to himself, and then he turns to Max, who has fallen asleep right on Carol's knee. Carol starts to lean on an oak tree that is close to shore, and closes his eyes while Max rests on Carol's side while using Carol's arm as a soft pillow on a very nice starry night while doing camping. (This chapter talks about KW and Carol having a special moment with Connie, and of course going camping. For this chapter, I put a few songs to it, they are; If We Hold On Together, singed by Diana Ross, Her Man, singed by Gary Allen, and That's What Friends Are For, from Disney's The Jungle Book. Please review and I hope you'll like it. Thank you!)[Chapter 15] CHAPTER 13: CAROL, CONNIE, KW AND MAX MOMENT As the days went by; Max gets to spend a lot of time with Carol, including KW and Angel, who is learning how to crawl. Max has been a very big help to Angel on how to crawl, and she starts to get the hang of it, which somehow made Carol, KW, and Connie very impressed with Max, and how much Angel has grown from a baby to a toddler. Carol smiled at that sweet touching moment, and he noticed that Connie took her a picture with her digital camera, and then he looked at KW, who somehow smiled at Carol, and he smiled back, and he softly sings to her; Carol: Every morning I watch you walk in to the office with your business suit and matching shoes/With your hair pulled up neatly, you tug at your glasses and you sit down, just two desks down/I watch you in the fluorescent glare, and my mind drifts away somewhere/And I see you in a different light, with your hair falling down and love in your eyes/In my mind, you're a beautiful sight, I see you, in a different light/Just the way I saw you last night. KW: The other girls in the office, the guys always notice when they walk by, but you're not the type/They don't know what I know, some things just don't show in tailored tweed, that's fine with me/Let them all think what they want to, as for me when I look at you. Both: I see you in a different light, with your hair falling down and love in your eyes/In my mind, you're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light/Just the way I saw you last night/I see you in a different light, with your hair falling down and love in your eyes/In my mind, you're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light/Just the way I saw you last night/It's you in a different light, with your hair falling down and love in your eyes/In my mind, you're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light/JUST THE WAY I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT! Connie smiled at Carol and KW singing together on that beautiful song, she took a picture of both Carol and KW together in her digital camera and smiled at that wonderful couple. Max smiled at them too along with Angel in his arms, which she start to hold onto Max's little hand into her little paw. \" KW, you are so beautiful. And I will always love you forever and for always. And I can't wait to have more cubs in the future, so Angel could have a brother or a sister someday.\" Carol said and gives KW a kiss on her beautiful red and soft lips. KW smiled and she says, \" I can't wait to have more babies someday either, Carol. And I think that we could let Max be part of our family, since you and I are like parents to Max while we're still parents to Angel.\" KW said which somehow made Carol, Connie, and Max smile at the same time. \" I think that will be very sweet, KW. I am pretty sure I will let Max be part of your lives, since you all took such good care of him when he first came to your island, which I appreciated so much, and I thank you for that.\" Connie said. \" Well…it was nothing, Max took care of us, just like what he promised, and we took care of him too.\" Carol said, and then, he cleared his throat and changed the subject, \" So, Connie, what are we going to do today?\" He asked. Connie smiled and thought for a little moment or two, and she thought of an idea. \" Carol, how will you like to help me bring everything down from the attic?\" She asked. \"Sure, I will like to help, but…what do we need to bring down from the attic?\" Carol asked. \"Well, we're going to bring down some old photos, and I am going to put some of my new photos that I took with my digital camera and put them into a new photo album…and maybe we could start thinking on what to do with the twenty thousand dollars that we have won at both singing competitions that we attend last weekend.\" Connie said. \" Oh, okay, that's fine by me.\" Carol said. \"Do you need my help, mom?\" Max asked. \"Uh, no, that's okay, but thank you for the offer.\" Connie said. Max nodded his head, and he continues on playing with little Angel while KW is knitting another blanket for Angel. Inside the attic of the house, Connie and Carol start to help with each other by bringing stuff down, however, Connie did show Carol the attic on what they put in there. \"Oh, whoa!\" Carol cried. \"Yeah…this is the attic where we put old stuff from a long time ago.\" Connie said. \"I didn't know you put old things up here. This is amazing.\" Carol said looking around the attic. \"Let's start over here right next to the book shelf.\" Connie said and had Carol following her to the book shelf. They went through a lot of books, until something caught Carol's eye, and he turned around and found a photo of Connie and her ex-husband getting married, and holding hands. \" Connie?\" Carol asked. \"Mm-hm?\" Connie asked while looking at Carol. \"Is this a photo of you and your husband getting married?\" He asked. Connie looked at the photo and she recognized it was her wedding photo of her and her ex-husband. \"Actually, that is a picture of me and my husband. However, that's my ex-husband.\" Connie said. \"Ex-husband?\" Carol asked. \"Yes, we both got separated probably right after Max was about…a year to two years old when we got separated, which is called a divorce. The reason why we got separated is because…well, my ex-husband who goes by the name of Todd, he was being very abusive to Max, Claire and myself.\" Connie said. \" Oh, I see. What's divorce mean?\" Carol asked. \"It means by getting separated by your spouse or mate, if you put it that way, however, if someone ends up getting separated from having an argument or some kind, they won't love each other anymore. But I know that you and KW still love each other, I can tell.\" Connie said. \" How can you tell?\" Carol asked. \"Well, I can tell that you always give KW lots of kisses, caressing her long beautiful auburn hair, and that you seem like a wonderful father to Angel, and a very good friend to Max. But I also know you love me as well too, Carol. The reason why I can tell is that; you seem like a very nice friend whenever I need someone to talk to whenever something's bothering me or something.\" Connie said. Carol just smiled while he watched Connie taking care of boxes of old stuff to bring downstairs, and then, he gazed at the wedding photo, and he starts to sing softly to himself; I hear you just got married/Had a month long honeymoon/And you were all smiles at the wedding/And you cried when you kissed the groom/I got no invitation/I guess that mailman didn't bring it to me/But I see the whole thing in slow motion/Every night as I try to sleep/My buddy John said you looked real pretty/And you acted like you were in love/He said the preacher asked for objections/And he thought about standing up/I told John he must've been crazy/'Cause you were just about to say I do/He just gave me a wink and said all he could think/Is it could've been me with you Carol continues to help Connie with the boxes while bringing them down the stairs, and he continues to sing; It could have been me standing there with you/It could have been me and my dreams coming true/But those dreams move on if you wait too long/It took me till now to see it could have been me/I don't guess I ever told you/That I went out and bought you a ring/I even carried it around in my pocket/Waiting to say the right thing Carol still continues to help Connie with boxes, and then, he suddenly kept gazing at the wedding photo inside the box that he was carrying, and he could imagine himself with Connie, Max, Claire, KW, Alexander, Angel, Ira, Judith, Douglas, and Daniel all getting married. He could imagine himself getting married to KW, while Connie is getting married to Douglas, while Judith and Ira are getting married with Max being the best man, along with Alexander, and Daniel, and Claire as the main of honor and Angel as the little flower girl. Carol continues to sing; I pulled it out the other day/But the diamond had lost its shine/Well I know how it feels 'cause my eyes grow dim/When I think you could've been mine/It could have been me standing there with you/It could have been me and my dreams coming true/But those dreams move on if you wait too long/It took me till now to see it could have been me/Oh, I called her just in time to be too late/You know those dreams move on if you wait too long/It took me till now to see (It could've been me) Carol still gazed at the wedding photo, and he could also imagine him, the other Wild Things, along with Max, Claire and Connie becoming a one big happy family since they're now part of Max's family and part of his life, and now…he has Max as his own…son. He continues to sing; It could have been me standing there with you/It could have been me and my dreams coming true/But those dreams move on if you wait too long/It took me till now to see it could have been me/IT COULD'VE BEEN ME/IT COULD'VE BEEN ME/IT COULD'VE BEEN ME/IT COULD'VE BEEN ME! Carol and Connie together came down the stairs with lots of photos in boxes, and Max came over to them and help them with the boxes, while Carol just kept on looking and smiling at Connie, and back at KW, and then, at Max. \" So, Carol, buddy. What did you and mom found in the attic?\" Max asked. \"Oh, just some old photos. However, we haven't decided on what to do with the twenty thousand dollars that we have won at the singing competitions, but we're pretty sure that something might come up, but we'll see.\" Carol said. \"Ahh, I see.\" Max said while nodding his head, and helps Carol with the boxes. KW smiled at that sweet touching moment with Carol and Max helping each other with the boxes of old photos, and then, she continues knitting a blanket for Angel. When night came again, while the whole family was sleeping, Carol couldn't get much sleep that night, because he has been thinking on what will be like if he could marry Connie and maybe still be a good husband to KW still, however, he let out a little sigh and goes over to the window and looks at the moon, which is very full that is very big that you could almost reach out and touch it. He closes his eyes and starts to imagine himself being with Connie and KW, and has Max as his own son, because of the friendship and bond is still growing a lot stronger every single day. Then, while imagining himself being with Connie, KW, Max, Claire, Angel, and the other Wild Things, a song came to his mind while he was still thinking about the two women that he really cares, including Max. He starts to sing softly to himself; She's like the wind through my tree/She rides the night next to me/She leads me through moonlight/Only to burn me with the sun/She's taken my heart/But she doesn't know what she's done/Feel her breath on my face/Her body close to me/Can't look in her eyes/She's out of my league/Just a fool to believe/I have anything she needs/She's like the wind/I look in the mirror and all I see/Is a young man with only a dream/Am I just fooling myself/That she'll stop the pain/Living without her/I'd go insane/Feel her breath on my face/Her body close to me/Can't look in her eyes/She's out of my league/Just a fool to believe/I have anything she needs/She's like the wind/Feel her breath on my face/Your body close to me/Can't look in your eyes/You're out of my league/Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe)/She's like the wind/(Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe/(She's like the wind) Just a fool to believe/ (Just a fool to believe) She's like the wind/(Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe/SHE'S LIKE THE WIND! Carol sang the last few words, and starts to head off to bed, and goes to sleep right next to Max, along with KW and Angel in the dining room, however, Max starts to sleep right next to Carol while using Carol's arm as a pillow and his other arm to hold onto, and turns it into a warm embrace. Carol smiled down at Max, and leans down and gives Max a kiss on the head and then, goes back to sleep for the rest of the night. (This chapter talks about having a special moment with Connie, Carol, KW, and Max, however there's a little love romance between Carol and Connie, but deep down; Carol is still in love with KW, and still cares about Connie, KW, and Max dearly. I put three songs into this chapter, they are called; In A Different Light, singed by Doug Stone, Could've Been Me, singed by Billy Ray Cyrus, and She's Like The Wind, singed by Patrick Swayze. Please review and hope you like my story and my other stories, if you look onto my profile.)[Chapter 16] CHAPTER 14: ON A DATE WITH DOUGLAS As the months passed by again, Connie has been seeing Carol and KW are still together, and taking care of their baby, which Angel is still adorable by the way. However, Connie has also been seeing…Douglas, who seems to have a crush on her, however, Douglas was nervous to admit his true feelings to Connie, and he doesn't know on what to say. Douglas had asked Max and Carol some good advice on how to ask Connie on a date, and they said just try to be yourself and follow your heart that way you'll know for sure. Douglas had agreed, and then, he goes over to Connie and says, \" Hi, Connie…I, uh…I was wondering if you like to, y-you know, go out to dinner with me, i-if that's o-okay with you?\" Connie seemed flattered that Douglas had asked her to go on a date, and she smiled and says, \"I will like that.\" And so they were on their date, and then, a song came to Connie's mind, and she starts to sing softly to herself while she is getting ready for the date with Douglas… Spare a little candle/Save some light for me/Figures up ahead/Moving in the trees/White skin in linen/Perfume on my wrist/And the full moon that hangs over/These dreams in the mist Connie and Douglas went out the door and they turned around and saw Max, Claire, Carol, KW, Angel, Ira, Judith, Alexander, and Daniel smiling at them, and hoped for the date to go well, both Connie and Douglas smiled back at them and head out. Connie continues to sing softly to herself… Darkness on the edge/Shadows where I stand/I search for the time/On a watch with no hands/I want to see you clearly/Come closer than this/But all I remember/Are the dreams in the mist Douglas and Connie went out to a nice seafood restaurant by the docks with a nice full moon, and once they finish eating their dinner, they had some very nice dessert, which is a nice apple cinnamon whip cream pie, and then they head out into the park. Connie continues to sing… These dreams go on when I close my eyes/Every second of the night I live another life/These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside/Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away/Is it cloak n dagger/Could it be spring or fall/I walk without a cut/Through a stained glass wall/Weaker in my eyesight/The candle in my grip/And words that have no form/Are falling from my lips/These dreams go on when I close my eyes/Every second of the night I live another life/These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside/Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. Douglas heard Connie singing to herself and he decided to help her, and he starts to sing as well… There's something out there/I can't resist/I need to hide away from the pain/There's something out there/I can't resist/The sweetest song is silence/That I've ever heard/Funny how your feet/In dreams never touch the earth/In a wood full of princes/Freedom is a kiss/But the prince hides his face/From dreams in the mist Douglas and Connie start to look at each other, and Douglas says, \"Connie, there's something that I have to tell you…I—I'm in love with you, Connie. I guess I have been in love with you since right after me and the others first arrived here to see Max, but…I just don't know on how I feel, and you seem like a very nice woman and a very good mother to Max and Claire, but I do know that you see Carol as a father figure to Max, which I totally understand, because I don't want to disappoint Carol, because he's my best friend, and he always count on me for everything…Ugh, too much?\" Connie just smiled, and she says, \"Douglas, I…I just don't know what to say, but I guess I have been in love with you whenever you're singing your song from the competition that we all entered in, and I say that your singing voice is very amazing and wonderful, and you seem like a very good friend to Carol, which I like him as a very good friend, but I do like you…a lot. For what I'm trying to say is…I'm in love with you, Douglas. I really do.\" Douglas just smiled, and Connie smiled back, and then, without thinking, they had their very first…KISS right on the lips, and Douglas was amazed on what a kiss feels like right on his beak, and then, they both finish the song they're singing… These dreams go on when I close my eyes/Every second of the night I live another life/These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside/Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away/THESE DREAMS GO ON WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES/EVERY SECOND OF THE NIGHT I LIVE ANOTHER LIFE/THESE DREAMS THAT SLEEP WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE/EVERY MOMENT I'M AWAKE THE FURTHER I'M AWAY! Once they made it back to the house, they all saw Carol, KW, Angel, Daniel, Max and Claire sleeping in the living room, and they looked at each other and they shared a nice romantic kiss on the lips and they all head off to bed for the rest of the night. \" Good night…my sweet Douglas.\" Connie said. \"Sleep well and sweet dreams, my beautiful Connie.\" Douglas said. They shared one more romantic kiss, and they head off to bed. When Connie went upstairs to bed, Douglas just smiled, and then, without notice, he fainted to the floor and says in a whisper, \"YES!\" Early the next morning, the other Wild Things, Max, Claire, and Connie all gathered around Douglas, who just fainted from last night. They were like; \"Douglas, Douglas, are you alright?\" or \"Wake up, Douglas.\" Then, Douglas woke up and then, he starts to blush in his face, and says, \"I'm in love with Connie.\" The other Wild Things, Max, and Claire were all amazed and very shocked that Douglas is in love with Connie, which somehow causes Connie to feel bashful in the face as well, since she is in love with Douglas. \" So, how did the date go?\" Carol asked while patting Douglas on the shoulder. \"Oh, it went wonderful. It's like a wonderful dream come true that I never felt before, and I just feel so wonderful.\" Douglas said while smiling. \"Wow. Way to go, Douglas. We're so proud of you and you too, mom.\" Max said with a smile. \"Thanks, Maxie.\" Connie said with a smile. \"This is so amazing, I—I feel like…like I can sing out to the world and jump for joy.\" Douglas said and he starts to sing while shaking around to the beat and then Carol, Max, Ira, Alexander, and Daniel start to shake to the beat as well… Douglas: Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line/Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time/Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line/Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time/My girl's name is Senora/I tell you friends I adore her/And when she dances, oh brother! /She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather.

Connie, KW, Claire, and Judith were all laughing and they start on clapping for the song that Douglas gets to sing with help from Carol, Max, Alexander, Ira, and Daniel. And they just took a nice bow and smiled, and Douglas just said, \"Phew! That was the longest song I get to sing when I'm feeling so happy and jumping for joy, hehehehehe.\" Connie just smiled and gives Douglas a kiss, and the other Wild Things, Max, and Claire were all like; \"Awwwwwww!\" Good thing, Claire used Connie's digital camera and took the picture of it, which Daniel and Alexander both looked at Claire on what she was holding. \" Oh, this is my mom's digital camera; it helps her to take so many pictures to have as memories.\" Claire explained. \"Ahh!\" Alexander and Daniel said at the same time while nodding their heads as if they understand. \"What do you know, Judy? Douglas is now in love with Connie. Isn't sweet, Judy?\" Ira said to Judith. \"Yeah. It sure does look very sweet, just like Carol and KW.\" Judith said. \"Judith…stop, please.\" Max said, eyeing Judith. \"Sorry.\" Judith said. \"It's fine.\" Max said. Connie and Douglas have been kissing for a long time, and without noticing, Carol and KW start on kissing as well, along with Judith and Ira kissing as well. \"Oh my, lots of kissing. This will be sweet.\" Claire thought to herself and took more pictures of Carol and KW, Judith and Ira kissing as well. After Connie and Douglas stopped kissing, they were blushing when everyone was watching. Connie says, \"I do like your song, Douglas. It was very amazing and totally wicked.\" \"Um, thanks, Connie. I really appreciated it.\" Douglas said feeling bashful. Carol just smiled at Douglas, and that he is very proud of him that he had found someone to love, just like he fell in love with KW, and soon became good friends with Max, and start to love him like Max is his own son, and he is glad that everyone is happily together forever and for always. (This chapter talks about Douglas has now fallen in love with Connie, and he starts to admit his true feelings, and he has his first kiss, which he hasn't felt what a kiss will feel like, and then, he jumps for joy on singing a very good song. The two songs for this chapter are called: These Dreams, singed by Heart, and Jump In The Line, singed by Harry Belafonte. Please review!)[Chapter 17] CHAPTER 15: SAILING BACK TO THE ISLAND OF THE WILD THINGS As weeks went by since Connie doesn't know on where to go for a vacation along with Max, Claire, and the Wild Things, because she has been thinking all day and night and nothing didn't seem to come to her. The Wild Things were also thinking as well, until…it came to Carol's mind. \" Why don't you all come with us on our boat, so we could take you all to our island? Will that work?\" He asked. Connie and Claire were shocked about it, however for Max, he just smiled, and he goes over to Carol and wraps his arm around Carol into a hug. Connie and Claire both looked at Max hugging onto Carol, KW, and Angel, and they both looked at Douglas, Daniel and Alexander since they're good friends with them, and they're also good friends to Judith and Ira, since they don't know them that well, which they will make seem happy to get to know Judith and Ira, along with the other Wild Things a lot better on what they do on the island. They both smiled at each other and they said, \" We'll be honored to go with you all to your island, since you all did such a wonderful job taking care of Max when he first arrived on your island. And maybe we could get to know you all a lot better on what you all do on the island.\" Carol, Douglas, Daniel, and Alexander smiled, along with Judith, Ira, and Max, and then, Carol spoke, \" Alright, that settles it, we'll leave at dawn.\" And so they all agreed, they all got their early sleep on that night while Connie helps the Wild Things get everything packed for their trip to the island of the Wild Things, she did got a little of help from both Carol and Douglas, while KW, Judith and Ira were helping Max, including a little help from Angel as well, and Claire got some help from both Alexander and Daniel. It's a good thing that both Connie and Claire brought their digital cameras to take pictures of the island of the Wild Things, and everything on what the Wild Things do on the island. When dawn came, they bought lots of food and water for their journey, both Claire and Max were feeling sleepy, so they were both carried by Carol and Daniel while Connie was holding onto Stumpy by the leash. However, they head down the forest which leads them to the beach where they hear the waves coming to shore, and then, all of the sudden, both Connie and Claire were both amazed of the sight of the boat that Carol had created since right after the Wild Things arrived to see Max again. Then, Carol spoke, \" Uh, I hope you all don't mind on sharing our bedrooms, if you're still feeling sleepy, which is fine by us on sharing our bedrooms. Anyway, let's get going!\" Then, they were all boarded on the boat; Carol starts to boat and starts to stir the boat, and they were off the island and out into the ocean and out to an unknown world once again. On a nice sunny day, the Wild Things were doing their usual stuff on the boat, but this time with Max, Connie, and Claire. Max was up in the Captain's quarters with Carol helping steering the boat, while Claire is spending time with Daniel and Alexander, while Connie was in the dining area with Judith and Ira, along with Douglas and his cat. \"Wow! This is so incredible. Isn't guys?\" Connie asked. \" Yep, it sure is, Connie. Right, Judy?\" Ira asked. \"Yeah. I just can't wait to get back home, but I know Connie said that we're welcomed into her home since we all did a wonderful job on taking care of Max, and that, both Max and Claire really wants us all to stay.\" Judith said. \"I totally agree with you, Judith. Connie did said that she is going to let all of us stay.\" A voice came from behind, and it was KW, nursing Angel with her arms folded. \"Hello, KW. How are you feeling?\" Connie and Douglas asked at the same time. \" I feel fine, thank you. I am just feeding Angel, because she was getting fussy, so I am feeding her.\" KW said. Both Connie and Douglas both smile and nod their heads as if they understand on how KW is feeling, and they both smile at Angel since she is still adorable as a toddler. \"Say, KW, mind if I ask you something?\" Connie asked. \"Sure. You can ask me.\" KW said. \"Have you thought of having more babies with Carol?\" Connie asked. KW was in thought about that question that Connie had asked her, and she looked up and says, \"I am not quite sure if we want more babies, but I will have to ask Carol about that and see what he has to say. But I don't know, but we're just going to have to wait and see what happens for our future.\" Connie smiled and nods her head, and she also said, \" Do you still love Carol? If yes, what do you love best about him?\" KW smiled and says, \"Yes, I do love Carol with all my heart and soul. On what I love best about Carol is…well…he's a very nice person with a bit of a temper, but I know he was like that sometimes whenever we argue or fight over something, he's very attractive, and handsome, but I do like his personality, because I always look up to him as a very good husband and a very good father to our daughter and also a very good leader on what he does to keep everyone in track on what they're doing.\" \" That's true, KW. I totally agree with you. Carol is also my best friend, and he always counts on me for everything. If Carol was stranded on a desert island, he could only take one thing, it'll be me. I also know that Carol still loves you, KW. No matter what, right?\" Douglas asked. \"Yes. No matter what, we'll always love each other.\" KW said. On one late afternoon with a bright sun, all the male Wild Things were all cleaning the boat, it's just like they're sailors sailing on an open sea, and they all start to sing a sailing song, with a little help of Max on the singing… Carol and Max: I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue/And it's hail to the starboard heave-ho/Look up, man a mermaid be waiting for you/In mysterious fathoms below. Alexander, Carol, Daniel, Douglas and Ira: Fathoms below, below/From wence wayward westerlies blow/Where Triton is king and his merpeople sing/In mysterious fathoms below Alexander, Daniel, Douglas, Ira and Max: Heave-ho/Heave-ho Alexander, Carol, Daniel, Douglas, Ira and Max: Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho/IN MYSTERIOUS FATHOMS BBBEEELLLOOOWWW! When night came, Connie is sleeping with Douglas and his cat, along with Stumpy, while Claire is sleeping with Daniel, and Max is sleeping on Carol's striped tummy with KW on the other side of Carol with Angel in her arms. However, when the Wild Things woke up the next morning, they all looked at their selves and they realized now that they're back into their human forms, just like what they did before, which they also realized that the Human Change will wear off in a few days, which they told Max, Claire, and Connie not to worry and not to panic as well and they were off into the ocean again. As days went on, the Wild Things were back to their Wild Thing selves again when the Human Change start to wear off and they were getting closer to their island. While Max, Connie and Claire were at the front of the boat, both Connie and Claire used their digital cameras and took a picture of the island and they were amazed as well. Max just smiled and remembered on how he came to the island of the Wild Things and how he met the Wild Things for the first time, and he turned around and looked up at Carol with a smile, which Carol had smiled back at Max, and Max turns his head back to the island. Carol just sighed and thought to himself, \"Boy, I am so proud of you, Max. I will still be like a father to you, because of our friendship and our bond is still within us, I love you, Max, like you're my own…son.\" Once they got to the island, they all got off the boat, which Carol had parked the boat to shore right next to the BIG rocks and they all helped Carol tie the boat into a few knots to make sure the boat is tied…tight without coming loose. Carol sniffed the air in the atmosphere and says, \"Home sweet home. Connie and Claire; welcomed to our island. Let us show you all around. Follow me!\" And so, Max went up ahead with Carol and they had Connie, Claire and the other Wild Things follow behind. And then, Connie starts to sing with help from Claire, KW and Judith… Connie: Oh ain't life wonderful/When everything is right/But sometimes wonderful Claire: Can fall apart sometimes/When your troubles knock you down/Pick yourself up off the ground and… ALL: Walk on/Walk on/Nothing ever stays wrong that long/Walk on/Oh walk on/Don't just stand there in the storm/Walk toward the light till you find the sun/And you'll be better off in the long run/And walk on. KW: Oh it's a heartache when love comes to an end/But even though your heart breaks/You know it's gonna mend Judith: Keep the faith right through good-bye/And don't you ever break your stride ALL: Walk on/Walk on/Nothing ever stays wrong that long/Walk on/Oh walk on/Don't just stand there in the storm/Walk toward the light till you find the sun/And you'll be better off in the long run/And walk on *Instrumental break* Walk on/Walk on/Nothing ever stays wrong that long/Walk on/Oh walk on/Don't just stand there in the storm/Walk toward the light till you find the sun/And you'll be better off in the long run/And walk on/Walk on/Walk on/Ohhh walk on/Walk on/OH WALK ON! They all head up the cliff and then, they saw the huts that were still standing, which is right next to the fortress that the Wild Things and Max had built together. \"Wow! Did you all made this?\" Connie asked. \"Yeah, yeah, we sure did. With help from Max.\" Carol said. \"It looks very good.\" Claire said. \"It's beautiful.\" Connie said. \"Thanks.\" Carol said. Both Connie and Claire were still amazed of the fortress that the Wild Things and Max had all built together, and that they are going to get used to being on the island of the Wild Things. (This chapter talks about when Connie and Claire were honored on going with Max and the Wild Things to go to the island of the Wild Things, so they could get to know the Wild Things a lot better on what the Wild Things do on the island. The two songs for this chapter are called: Fathoms Below, from Disney's The Little Mermaid, and Walk On, singed by Reba McEntire. Please review!)[Chapter 18] Chapter 16: The Tour of the Island Once Max, his family and the Wild Things all made it up the cliffs and they all go down to where the fortress was still standing. \"Wow. This is like taking a trip down memory lane, isn't Carol?\" Max asked. \"Yeah, it sure does. Anyway, let's give your family a tour of the island. Come on, Douglas, Ira, Alexander, and Daniel; let's go show Connie and Claire the whole island. Max, you could come along if you want.\" Carol said. \"Sure. I will like that.\" Max said. \"Me too.\" Ira said. \"Same here, Carol. That sounds like a perfect idea.\" Douglas said. \"Same here.\" Alexander said. \"Ditto.\" Daniel said. \"Alright then, let's get going. Judith and KW, we'll be back shortly, just don't start anything without us, just try to get yourselves comfortable while we're gone.\" Carol said. \"Alright, Carol. We'll be fine. And take your time.\" KW said. During the tour of the island, Carol, Alexander, Douglas, Ira and Daniel all showed Connie and Claire everything around the island, including the holes in trees that Ira gets to do, including the crashes that Alexander did when he runs into trees, including the wooden chips that Daniel gets to do as well, and also the crashed trees that Douglas gets to do since he has the best arm, and then, shortly after, Carol took Connie and Claire to his secret hideaway cave where he had built his dream model city made out of sticks, clay and rock. Then, a song came to Carol's mind, and causes him to sing… Carol: Sure I think about you now and then/But it's been a long long time. Douglas: I've got a good life now I've moved on/So when you cross my mind. Alexander, Carol, Daniel, Douglas, and Ira: I try not to think about/What might have been/'Cause that was then/And we have taken different roads/We can't go back again/There's no use giving in/And there's no way to know/What might have been. Alexander: We could sit and talk about this all night long/And wonder why we didn't last. Carol and Douglas: Yes they might be the best days/We will ever know/But we'll have to leave them in the past. Alexander, Carol, Daniel, Douglas and Ira: So try not to think about/What might have been/'Cause that was then/And we have taken different roads/We can't go back again/There's no use giving in/And there's no way to know/What might have been. Daniel: That same old look in your eyes/It's a beautiful night/I'm so tempted to stay. Ira: But too much time has gone by/We should just say good-bye/And turn and walk away. Alexander, Carol, Daniel, Douglas and Ira: And try not to think about/What might have been/'Cause that was then/And we have taken different roads/We can't go back again/There's no use giving in/And there's no way to know/What might have been/No we'll never know/WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN! Connie and Claire all smiled at the Wild Things, and they all each give them a hug to make them so happy, which however, they were amazed on the sight of Carol's dream model city. \"Wow! Did you make this?\" Claire asked. \"Yeah, yeah.\" Carol said. \"It's very good.\" Claire said. \"It looks beautiful, Carol. You are very creative.\" Connie said. \"Thanks…I showed this to Max once, and I told him that we were going to make a whole world like this, but…everyone used to come here, but you know…You know what it feels like when all your teeth are falling out really slowly…and you don't realize…and then you notice that, well, they're really far apart? And then one day…you won't have any teeth anymore.\" Carol said. Connie and Claire both looked silent for a moment, and Claire says, \"Yeah.\" \"Well, it was like that, however, I love building things like this. I just…want to make them feel real, and…I also want to make them on what to be part in, like this…Claire, come here.\" Carol said. Claire took a step toward Carol, both Connie and Douglas both watched when Carol enveloped Claire into a nice warm hug. \"How does that feel like?\" Carol asked while looking down at Claire. \"Um, warm…furry…soft, and very good.\" Claire said. \"That's right. I also once told Max that this was going to be place where the only things you wanted to have happen…would happen. Right after I told Max that, I was going to end up eating my feet off, which is when Max told me about building a fort for all of us to be together as a family, however, Max lied to me, because…I believe that Max was still afraid that I was going to eat him, but that sort-a slipped right out of my mouth, but I didn't mean to scare him off like that, but I know I didn't mean to be that way, I was just scared and that I didn't know that Max was not a king at all, and that…Douglas was right.\" Carol said. \" I was?\" Douglas asked softly. \"Douglas was right about Max not being a king, and that Max was just a boy, just a boy who has gone through tough times, and he wants to know if I still like Max for who he is, is by being himself, but I really do like him for who he is, and he was like a son to me, and that I love him so much. But no matter what happens, Max will always be my best friend, just like I am to everybody else, including you, Connie, and you too, Claire.\" Carol said, feeling tears coming out of his eyes, and tries to fight them off. Connie just looked surprised on what Carol has been going through, and that Max was trying to make Carol's dream come true, but having a tough time, she looks up at Douglas, who just nods his head, and she goes over to Carol and takes his hand. \" Carol, I know how you feel, and from back at home, I—I just want to apologize to you from kissing you on the lips, but I just don't know what came over me, until I start to lay eyes on Douglas whenever you and I start on talking about everything, including all the problems you had when you're with Max and all, and…I just want to apologize, and I hope that we could be friends. After all, I really do want you to be part of Max's life, and you're like father figure to Max, because I can tell that you and Max had such a very good friendship and nothing could ever keep you two apart, but you both will always have each other, no matter what.\" Connie said. Douglas, Alexander, Ira, Daniel and Claire all smiled at Connie, and they all looked up at Carol, and they smiled at him also. Carol just looked at the others that were smiling, and then, he smiled at Connie, and gives her a warm embrace. \"Thank you; for being a very good friend, and a very good mother to Max, and yes, I will definitely be a father to Max, just like I am to Angel. Speaking of which, we all should probably head back to where KW and Judith are at, I bet that they are making a wonderful supper. Let's go!\" Carol said, and they all followed Carol out of the secret hideaway cave and all head back into the desert, back at the forest, and right back to the fortress. Once they all got to the fortress, they all sit by the fire, having a wonderful dinner, and then, another song came to Douglas' mind, and he starts to sing and got Carol to start singing also… Douglas: I take off time to time/With those crazy friends of mine/Head out on steel horses/With wheels and we ride. Carol: We burn up that road to old Mexico/Blend in with the desert/Just we amigos/And we roll… Both (Carol and Douglas): Cowboys like us sure do have fun/Racin' the wind, chasin' the sun/Take the long way around back to square one/Today we're just outlaws out on the run/There'll be no regrets, no worries and such/For cowboys like us. Douglas: We talk about livin', babies, and women/All that we've lost and all we've been givin'. Carol: We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done/Drink one more cold, come mornin' get up/And we roll… Both: (Carol and Douglas): Cowboys like us sure do have fun/Racin' the wind, chasin' the sun/Take the long way around back to square one/Today we're just outlaws out on the run/There'll be no regrets, no worries and such/For cowboys like us/Cowboys like us sure do have fun/Racin' the wind, chasin' the sun/Take the long way around back to square one/Today we're just outlaws out on the run/There'll be no regrets, no worries and such/For cowboys like us. Douglas: COWBOYS LIKE US! The other Wild Things, along with Max and his family all clapped for Carol and Douglas sing a duet together on that western song, both Carol and Douglas looked at each other, and they both pat each other on the shoulders to show each other their friendship. Max, KW, and Connie go over to Carol and Douglas, and they all give them a warm embrace to congratulate them on their performance. \"Speaking of which, I think we should all get some sleep, it's getting late.\" KW said. The other Wild Things all agree as well. \" Where do you all…usually sleep?\" Claire asked. \"We sleep in our huts, and we sometimes sleep together in a pile, like we did with Max to keep each other warm. Since you're all of our guests on this island, I suggest that we should all sleep together in a big pile, and try to get warm, and we could find out on what we can do together on the next day.\" Carol said. And he all heard agreements from Max, and the other Wild Things, and they all looked at Connie and Claire with pleading eyes, and Connie just smiled and give in. \"Alright, let's all sleep together.\" She said. \"Okay.\" Claire said, and so, they all got into a big pile with Max sleeping right next to Carol and KW, Connie sleeping right next to Douglas, and Claire sleeping right next to Daniel and Alexander, along with Judith and Ira. And they all are exchanging their good nights to each other. \" Good night, KW.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Carol. I love you.\" KW said. \"Good night, Ira.\" Carol said. \"Night.\" Ira said. \"Good night, Douglas.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Carol.\" Douglas said. \"Good night, Alexander.\" Carol said. \"Good night.\" Alexander said. \"Good night, Judith.\" Carol said. \"Good night.\" Judith said. \"Good night, Judy.\" Ira said. \"Good night, darling.\" Judith said. \"Good night.\" Alexander said. \"Night, Alex.\" Judith said. \"Good night, Max.\" KW said. \"Good night, KW.\" Max said. \"Good night, Alex, and good night, Daniel.\" Claire said. \"Good night, Claire.\" Alexander said. \"Good night, Claire.\" Daniel said. \"Oh, good night, Max, and good night, Claire.\" Douglas said. \"Yeah, good night, Max, and good night, Claire.\" Ira said. \"Good night, Carol, Daniel, Alexander, Ira, Judith, Douglas, Claire, and good night, Max.\" Connie said. \"Good night, Connie.\" All the Wild Things said at the same time. \"Good night, mom.\" Both Max and Claire said at the same time. \"Boy, this is nice. Very nice.\" Douglas said. \"Good night, everybody…everybody, sweet dreams.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Carol, and I love you.\" Max said. \"Good night, Douglas, and I love you.\" Connie said. \"Good night, Alexander and Daniel, I love you both.\" Claire said. \"Good night, Max, KW, and Angel, I love you all very much.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Connie, and I love you.\" Douglas said. \"Good night, Claire, and we love you too.\" Alexander said. And then, they all start on getting some sleep for the night to keep warm from getting frost-bite, and become a one big happy family. (This chapter talks about Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Daniel, and Ira were all showing Max's mother and sister the whole island, and Carol shows them his secret hideaway cave that he showed Max once before, and Connie starts to apologize to Carol for kissing him on the lips back at her home, and she knows that Carol is STILL in love with KW, no matter what, and that Connie has Douglas, and that she feels happy for both Carol and KW that they are still together no matter what. Oh, I forgot; the two songs for this chapter are called; What Might Have Been, singed by Little Texas, and Cowboys Like Us, singed by George Strait. Please review!)[Chapter 19] (Sorry for keeping you all waiting, I was busy, trying to take care of everything around my place, and I was also kept thinking of a new chapter to my WTWTA story, anyhow, enjoy this new chapter.) Chapter 19: Carol and Max Together Since right after they all had dinner around the camp-fire, while the Wild Things, along with Max, Claire and Connie were sleeping in the pile, Max just kept staring at the night sky in the pile, and just saw a shooting star that was shooting very fast all across the night sky. \"Star light, star bright. The first star I see tonight…wish I may, wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight…I wish Carol could be a father to me.\" Max said to himself and closed his eyes to make his wish come true. Then, all of the sudden, Max starts to tiptoe out of the pile and starts to sit right by the fire to get warm with his mind full of thoughts. However, once he got to the camp-fire, he saw Carol sitting by the fire as well. Max smiled and goes right next to his best buddy and sits right next to him with his head on Carol's feathery leg. \"Hey, Max.\" Carol said softly, trying not to wake up the others. \"Hey, Carol.\" Max said softly as well. \"You okay?\" Carol asked feeling concern for Max. However, for Max, he just looks up at Carol with a smile and says, \"Yeah. I'm okay. How about you? You okay?\" Max asked. Carol smiled back and says, \"Yeah.\" \" So, how do you like my family, Carol?\" Max asked. \"I like your family, Max. They're very nice, and they're lovely too…However, back at your place, I had a nice talk with your mom, and…we both start to get to know each other, and she told me that she really appreciates for taking care of you since right after you came to this island.\" Carol said. Max was a bit surprised about Carol having a nice chat with his mom, and then, he starts to feel…happy that Carol and his mom were starting to get to know each other and became good friends, but deep down, Carol still LOVES KW, no matter what. \"Someday if we all go back to my place again very soon, I really do like you to be a father to me, Carol.\" Max said feeling a little shy and blushing as well. Carol was very surprised on what Max had told him, and then, he looks down at him, smiles, and starts to rub Max's back, and then, Max starts to climb onto Carol's lap and Carol wraps his arms around Max to keep him and they both stare at the night sky, looking at the beautiful sparkly stars twinkling in the sky. \"You know, Carol. You're still very soft.\" Max said with a smile. \"Yes, I'm big and fluffy! You can hug me as long as you wish. Cause I love hugs.\" Carol said with a smile and gives Max a nice warm tight hug. When morning came, KW, Connie, and Claire were making a very big breakfast, until a song came into their minds, and they start to sing… Claire, Connie, and KW: Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah/Hoah, ooh KW: Sun kisses the windowsill/And I am still on my second cup of pity me Connie and KW: Yeah, it's been a long night chasing ghosts/But at the most, it's been a rude awakening/That all too late I finally see (I finally see), I see/That it's- ALL (Claire, Connie, and KW): My loss, my lonely/My mistake, mine only/Mine all, mine all, mine (mine)/Hoah, and it's my bad, my broken/All my should haves left unspoken/Mine all, mine all, mine KW: Hoah hoah hoah yeah/I drove you to the edge of the map/And after that, I pushed you off just to watch you/Fall Claire and KW: You never were the bounce back kind/But boy, this time you've proven me wrong after all/No I'm the one who's gonna crawl/Cause it's- ALL (Claire, Connie and KW): My loss, my lonely/My mistake, mine only/Mine all, mine all, mine (mine)/Hoah, and it's my bad, my broken/All my should haves left unspoken/Mine all, mine all, mine KW: Always thought I'd get to sorry/But the chance has come and gone/So if it finds its way back in/I'll hold on, hold on, hold on ALL (Claire, Connie and KW): My loss (that's my loss)/My lonely (my lonely)/My mistake (my mistake)/Mine only/Mine all, mine all/Mine all, mine all/Mine all, mine/It's mine all mine/Yeah it's mine all mine/All mine, all mine/All mine, all mine! \" Ooh. What smells so good?\" Carol asked. \"Breakfast!\" Connie said. \"Wow. You girls sure made a whole lot of food this morning.\" Ira said feeling so amazed and his mouth feeling watery. \"Thank you, Ira. Okay, everybody, help yourselves, and dig in.\" KW said. They all start to get everything they can on their big leaves as plates and they all sit together and eat their breakfast. Claire starts to go over to where Daniel is sitting at, and they both start to eat their breakfast together. \"Did you sleep well last night, Daniel?\" Claire asked. Daniel looked at Claire with a smile and says, \"Yes, I slept very well last night. How about you, Claire? Did you sleep well last night?\" Claire just smiled and says, \"Yeah. I slept well.\" Daniel just smiled and says, \"Good.\" And then, they both continued to eat their breakfast. Later, while the Wild Things, along with Max and Connie were all doing their normal things, however for Connie, Douglas took her to a very nice valley where the Wild Things had such very beautiful flowers to pick from, while Douglas just picks lots of fruit from fruit trees nearby. Claire was also having a little fun with Daniel at a nice beautiful lagoon, while Carol is teaching Angel how to swim, KW just smiled along with Max watching Carol teaching Angel how to swim while Alexander, Judith and Ira were just floating on the water of the lagoon, until Claire and Daniel both went through the water-fall and sat down on some big rocks underneath the water-fall and looked at each other quietly without saying a word. When Carol, Max, Alexander and Ira were watching Daniel and Claire looking at each other underneath the water-fall, a song somehow came into their minds and they all start to sing… Carol: It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen/A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams/The ties that once bound her now are broke away/And she's like a baby, just learning how to play. Max: She never thought that love could ever end so soon/Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon/When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay/And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday. ALL (Alexander, Carol, Ira, and Max): Now, she's a lady down on love/She needs somebody to gently pick her up Carol: She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound Max: To a man who would love her and never let her down Alexander: Well, I know a lady that's down on her love/'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch/But work took me away from home late at nights Ira: And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights/Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust/And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust. ALL (Alexander, Carol, Ira and Max): Now, she's a lady down on love/She needs somebody to gently pick her up Alexander: She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound Ira: To a man who would love her and never let her down ALL (Alexander, Carol, Ira and Max): NOW SHE'S A LADY…DOWN ON LOVE! KW and Judith just looked at the boys watching Daniel and Claire sitting on some big rocks underneath the water-fall looking at each other quietly. \"Wow. That moment is very beautiful, isn't it, Judith?\" KW asked. \"Yeah. I say that both Daniel and Claire are starting to become lovers, that's what I think, but I know that Alex really likes Claire as well, but they are best friends.\" Judith said. \"I totally agree with you on that, Judith.\" KW said softly and starts to nurse Angel with her arms folded. Carol just turned his head and looks at KW with a smile, which KW looks at Carol and she smiles at him back. Ira turns his head around and looks at Judith with a smile, which Judith looks at Ira and she smiles at him back as well. Max and Alexander just looked at the others smiling at their mates and they continue to look at Daniel and Claire still sitting on the same big rocks underneath the beautiful water-fall of the beautiful lagoon. (This chapter talks about Carol and Max being together, along with Connie having some alone time with Douglas in the valley, and Daniel and Claire having some alone time underneath the water-fall of the lagoon. The two songs I put for this chapter are called: Mine All Mine, singed by SheDaisy, and Lady Down On Love, singed by Alabama. I hope you all will like this chapter, and I hope you will review. Please review, thank you.)[Chapter 20] (Hi, everyone. It's me; ChelleNorlund. I am so very sorry for taking so very long on finishing this story; Where The Wild Things Are 2, the reason why is because my computer was not working, all because of my fire-wall, and that I was up in Washington State to go see my dad and stepmother, and that I was also doing chores around my place as well. So I am going to try to finish the story, if not then…I'm sure you guys get the idea that I'm going to be busy. Anyway, enjoy this new chapter.) Chapter 20: Connie and KW moment and Making Necklaces When morning came to the island, Carol and Max were having fun at the lake, like catching fish and swimming, while Judith, Ira, Alexander, Daniel, Claire and Douglas were all relaxing in the sun and playing the water as well. As for Connie and KW, they were watching everyone playing the water, because KW is nursing Angel in her arms, and they both are having a nice chat about Carol and Max being as father and son figures to each other. \" You know, KW. I say your husband; Carol really does love Max.\" Connie said with a smile. \"Yes, he sure does. Because I see the two of them becoming good friends when Max first arrived here for the first time. Ouch!\" KW said when she felt the pinch on her breast while nursing Angel. \"Yeah, I agree. When Max first came home, I was so worried sick about him running away, and…when he came back home, I was so happy that he came back and that I apologized to him for yelling at him, and he apologized to me for biting me. However…earlier around the next morning, Max told me about all of you guys, and that…I was very thankful that you all took such good care of him when he's with you guys.\" Connie said, and then…KW starts to smile at Connie, while Connie smiled back, and then…they both start to sing… KW: I know there's someone somewhere Connie: Someone who's sure to find me soon KW: After the rain goes there are rainbows Connie: I'll find my rainbow soon KW: Soon it won't be just pretend Both (Connie and KW): Soon a happy ending Connie: Love, can you hear me KW: If you're near me Connie: Sing your song KW: Sure and strong Both (Connie and KW): And soon… Later, back at the fortress, Max, Connie, Claire and the Wild Things were all having a wonderful dinner, which is fish that both Max and Carol got from the lake, and that everyone is proud of Max and Carol for catching a one huge fish from the lake to have for dinner. After everyone ate the fish, there was a huge loud burp, and that burp came from…Carol. \"Oops…excuse me.\" Carol said while covering his mouth with a leave that was on his lap with his face turning red. \"You're excused.\" Connie said with a smile. Douglas smiled and put his arm around Connie's shoulder, while Connie relaxed with her head on Douglas' arm. Then, all of the sudden…snow start to fall from the sky, and that the Wild Things all had a fire-place inside the fortress to stay warm. When everyone went to sleep in the pile, all except for Max and Carol, they're just looking at the night sky and watching the snow fall from the sky as well, until…they start to sing… Max: I know there's someone somewhere Carol: Someone who's sure to find her soon Max: After the rain goes there are rainbows Carol: She'll find her rainbow soon Max: Soon my breaking heart will mend Both (Carol and Max): Soon a happy ending Carol: Troubles behind her Max: I will find her Carol: Homeward bound Max: Safe and sound Both (Max and Carol): And soon….. When morning came to the island once again, Carol, Alexander, Ira, Douglas and Daniel all start walk along the beach looking for some shells to make something very nice for Max, Angel, Connie, Claire, KW and Judith on how much they all love them very much. And then, they got all of the shells and other things they found on the beach and they all went to Carol's secret hideaway cave to make the best necklaces for Max, Angel, Connie, Claire, KW and Judith, all of the sudden…they all start to sing… Carol: Leaves fall in the cool October air Douglas: Days grow short and I can't remember Alexander: Where I saw you last Daniel: Turned against the summerlight Ira: Walking off on that final August night ALL (Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Daniel and Ira): I was there on my knees all alone/In a world where nothing ever stays the same/I am left with only things I cannot change/You're gone away/And left me things I cannot change Carol: Smoke will rise and the fire always burns Douglas: Sands will drift and tides will turn Alexander: And I can't wrestle with the sea Daniel and Ira: Rearrange the sky or fight against the wind ALL (Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Daniel and Ira): Anymore than I can bring you back to me/In a world where nothing ever stays the same/I am left with only things I cannot change/You're gone away/And left me things I cannot change/So far away and left me things I cannot change/Left me things I cannot change/Left me things I cannot change… When noon came to the island, Carol, Alexander, Douglas, Ira and Daniel all got back to the fortress and they saw Max, Connie, Angel, Claire, KW and Judith on the beach, waiting for the others to get back, and then, they all saw Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Ira and Daniel coming towards them, and then…Carol, Ira, Alexander, Douglas and Daniel all showed Max, Angel, Connie, Claire, KW and Judith some necklaces that they all made. \"Wow. For me?\" Max asked, looking at the necklace that Carol made for him, which has his initial and Carol's initial as well. \"Yes, I made it for you, Max, because you're my son.\" Carol said, and Max gives him a hug, while Carol goes over to KW and Angel. \"I made this necklace for you, my little Angel.\" Carol said while giving Angel a kiss on the forehead, puts a little pearl necklace around Angel's neck, which made Angel cooed, and Carol starts to give KW her necklace as well, which has roses and rubies as well. \"Awwwwww, Carol, you're so very sweet, darling.\" KW said with a smile, and then…Carol and KW shared a wonderful loving kiss on their lips. \" I made this necklace for you, my Judy.\" Ira said, giving Judith a necklace, which has violets. \"Awww, Ira, my love, I love it. Thank you.\" Judith said, gives Ira a kiss on the lips. Douglas gave Connie a necklace which is all white with lots of pearls and white soft shells. \"Awwww, Douglas. That is so very sweet of you, I love it.\" Connie said with a smile and gives Douglas a kiss on the cheek, which made Douglas blush and giggled at the same time. Together Alexander and Daniel both made necklaces for Claire, because they both love Claire as a very good friend. \"We made these necklaces for you, Claire. Because you're very sweet to us, and we cared about you as well.\" Alexander said, giving his necklace to Claire, which has lots of pearls and white shells, while Daniel gives her his necklace, which is all black with roses as well. Claire smiled at the necklaces that both Alexander and Daniel gave her, and then she starts to give them both hugs and kisses on the cheek, which made them blush. \"Thanks, Alex and thanks, Daniel. I love them. Thank you.\" Claire smiled, and when night came to the island again, Max, Connie and Claire all slept with the Wild Things in a one giant Wild Thing sleeping pile underneath the night sky filled with lots of twinkling stars shining in the sky. (This chapter talks about Connie and KW have a wonderful moment together while watching the others playing in the water of the lake, Carol and Max looking at the night sky together, and also…Carol, Alexander, Douglas, Daniel and Ira making wonderful necklaces to Max, Claire, Connie, Angel, KW and Judith, which is very very sweet. The songs \"Soon\" and \"Soon Reprise\" is from the movie called Thumbelina and the song \"Things I Cannot Change\" is singed by the Mavericks. I hope you all like the chapter to this story, and please be sure to review this chapter as well. Thank you.)[Chapter 21] (Hello, everyone. I'm sorry for taking such a very long time to get back to you on this story. I was doing job training at this center called Woodrow Wilson Rehab Center; anyway, this chapter is going to be a nice Christmas special. This is when Max, Connie, Claire, and the Wild Things get to celebrate Christmas for the first time back in Portland, Oregon. Please be sure to review this chapter, and I hope you all will love it. Please…Enjoy!) Chapter 21: Christmas Time At Home A few weeks ago, Max, Connie, Claire and the Wild Things all have decided to spend time with each other for the Christmas Holidays in Portland, Oregon, which the Wild Things all agreed on going with them to celebrate Christmas together, and it'll be also Angel's first Christmas too. When December came to Portland, Oregon, Max had no school for his Winter break, and he was glad too. Connie got a head start on going shopping to get everything to wrap and put under the Christmas tree that they put up earlier since after Thanksgiving. The Wild Things were all at Max's house, wrapping presents, and also decorating the house from top to bottom filled with Christmas decorations. However, the problem is…KW has not been feeling herself lately, she has been feeling nauseous, dizziness, cramps nearly everywhere around her body, and she has been vomiting as well. Connie, Judith and Claire start to feel sorry for her, same with Carol who had noticed as well, including Max too, because they all hope that KW will get better though. \" Well, all the presents have been wrapped, and are ready to be opened until Christmas Day. Oh, I almost forgot…The Christmas Pickle Ornament.\" Connie said while pulling out a small box that has the Christmas Pickle Ornament. \"What's a Christmas Pickle Ornament?\" Douglas and Carol asked at the same time, which they looked at each other, and they pat each other on the shoulder with a smile. \" Well, Douglas and Carol. I am glad that you both asked…A Christmas Pickle Ornament is an ornament that a nice holly jolly figure named Santa Claus puts on the tree every Christmas Eve. Because on Christmas Day, whoever finds the Christmas Pickle Ornament that is on the tree, will be the first person or Wild Thing to open a present first and also gets the Pickle Gift. It's a special tradition that me, Max and Claire did on every year for Christmas.\" Connie said. \"Ohh.\" The Wild Things all said at the same time, thinking that is a very special Christmas tradition. \" Connie…may I speak with you for a moment?\" KW whispered. \"Sure.\" Connie said and she stood up and walks over to KW. \"What's going on, KW? Is something wrong?\" Connie asked feeling concern for KW. \"Well, you know I have been feeling sick lately, right?\" KW asked. \"Yeah, I did notice it, and Carol noticed it too. He was worried about you.\" Connie said. \"Well…I did have those symptoms when I was…carrying Angel.\" KW said. \"You mean?\" Connie asked, thinking on what KW is going to say. \"Yes…I'm pregnant with Carol's second cub.\" KW said. \"Really? That's wonderful news, KW.\" Connie said with a smile and gives her a hug. \"Thanks, Connie.\" KW said with a smile. \"How far along are you into the pregnancy?\" Connie asked. \"Oh about seven weeks. Maybe due sometime in the Spring.\" KW said. \"Wow. This is wonderful news.\" Connie said. \" Yes, but there's more…I may be pregnant with…twins.\" KW said. \"Aaaah! This is so wonderful, KW. You're going to be a mommy again. When are you going to tell Carol?\" Connie asked. \"I am thinking maybe on Christmas Eve, and I will tell everyone on Christmas Day.\" KW said. \"That's a wonderful idea. I bet Carol is going to be so surprised to hear the news.\" Connie said. KW smiled and gives Connie a hug and they went back to the group, seeing everyone is putting up Christmas decorations all over the house from top to bottom. Then, all of a sudden, music started to play on the CD player, it's a song from a group called: Band-Aid, singing to a song called: Do They Know It's Christmas, then, Max, Connie, Claire, and the Wild Things all started to sing to the song… Douglas: It's Christmastime; there's no need to be afraid At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade Connie: And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime Carol: But say a prayer to pray for the other ones At Christmastime It's hard, but when you're having fun KW, Claire and Judith: There's a world outside your window And it's a world of dread and fear Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears Max, Alexander, Ira: And the Christmas bells that ring there Are the clanging chimes of doom Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you Carol and KW: And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime Judith and Ira: The greatest gift they'll get this year is life Claire and Alexander: Oh, where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow ALL (Max, Connie, Claire, and Wild Things): DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMASTIME AT ALL? Carol, Max, Douglas, Ira, Alexander: Here's to you Bull: Raise a glass for everyone KW, Claire, Connie and Judith: Here's to them Bull: Underneath that burning sun ALL (Max, Connie, Claire and the Wild Things): DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMASTIME AT ALL? FEED THE WORLD FEED THE WORLD FEED THE WORLD LET THEM KNOW IT'S CHRISTMASTIME AGAIN FEED THE WORLD LET THEM KNOW IT'S CHRISTMASTIME AGAIN… Max, Connie, Claire and the Wild Things all cheered and clapped for the song, like they sound very good on singing to that Christmas song. \"Wow, Whoo! That was very good.\" Max cheered. Carol picks up Max and spins him around in circles, which made Max laugh. \"I so agree with you, my boy; Max.\" He said, which made Max smile up at Carol and gives him a hug. Later, Claire accidentally bumped into Bull and Alexander, which they were somehow…under the mistletoe. \"Wow, what's that hanging up there?\" Alexander asked, looking at the little leaves tied together with little white flowers attached as well. \"That is mistletoe. It's when two people are under it; they have to kiss each other for a short time.\" Claire said with a smile. \"Ohh.\" Alexander and Bull said at the same time with a blush on each other's faces. Claire smiled at both Alexander and Bull and goes over to them under the mistletoe and gives each of them a kiss on the cheek. \"Awwwww.\" Carol, Max, Connie, KW, Judith, Ira and Douglas said at the same time looking at Claire given Alexander and Bull a kiss on the cheek. Christmas Eve came by; Max is so excited about Santa Claus coming and wants to get everything all set for Santa's arrival. So, he made the Wild Things a one simple list on what they can to get ready for Christmas Day. \"Alright, Wild Things. We've got a lot of things to do for Santa's arrival. We have to make sure that the house is all neat and clean and all sparkly and squeaky. Here's a list of the things that you guys can do to help.\" Max said while giving the Wild Things each a list on what they can do to get ready for Santa's arrival. \" Wow, this is a very good list, Max. We'll be honored to help out around the house.\" Carol said. \"Yeah, I agree.\" Douglas said. \"Me too.\" Alexander said. \"Me three.\" Ira said. \"Same here.\" Judith said. \"Of course.\" KW said. \"I'll help too.\" Bull said. \"Where's your mom and sister, Max?\" Carol asked, feeling curious to know where Connie and Claire are at. \"I think they went a bit of shopping, so it's us here at home. I'm sure they'll be back soon enough.\" Max said. \"Oh, right. Anyway, let's get started on the list on what we can do around the house.\" Carol said. \"Good thinking.\" Max said with a smile. So they all got started on the list of the things on what they can do to help around the house to get ready for Santa's arrival on Christmas Eve. KW and Judith work together on cleaning the kitchen from top to bottom, Angel was watching her mommy and auntie doing all the cleaning, and clapped her little paws, which somehow made KW and Judith smile at that sweet little moment. Ira and Alexander work together on cleaning the dining room by dusting, sweeping and mopping, including cleaning the windows. \"Wow, this dining room is all dusty, and dust makes me sneeze.\" Alexander said while rubbing his nose to get rid of the dust out of his nose. \"Yeah, but it will soon be all shining and clean though.\" Ira said. Bull and Douglas work together on cleaning the bathroom, which is a bit small, but the shower and bathtub are big, they also cleaned the mirrors, toilet, sinks, and the shower and tub as well. As for Carol and Max, they work together on cleaning the bedrooms, by dusting the furniture, cleaning the mirrors and windows, fold all the clothes, put the dirty clothes in the laundry room to be washed, and they also made the beds. They also work together on putting up more Christmas decorations all over the place. They also vacuum the floors, including the carpet from the living room, stairs, and bedrooms as well. Max and KW work together on sweeping the porches, Carol and Douglas work together on cutting the grass, so the ground will be ready for snow to come. Alexander and Bull work together on cleaning the garage while KW and Judith get to play with little Angel. When Connie and Claire came back, they were both surprised to see what Max and the Wild Things did together on cleaning the house and taking care of the yard. \"Wow, this looks wonderful you guys. Thank you.\" Connie said with a smile and feeling so overwhelmed. \"Well, we did it because to show you our love and also got into the Christmas spirit.\" Max said with a blush upon his face. \"I see. And I noticed that you cut the grass too. It looks very good.\" Connie said. \"Thank you.\" Carol said with a blush upon his face. Later, when night came, Connie got to the computer and found the Track Santa Claus website and found out where Santa Claus is at. \"Whatcha doing, Connie?\" Carol asked. \"Ah! Oh, Carol. You scared me.\" Connie said. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to…I just want to know on what you're doing.\" Carol said. \"Oh, I'm just checking on Santa Claus to see on where Santa Claus is at.\" Connie said. \"Oh. Um…do you know on what's wrong with KW?\" Carol asked. \"I think so, but I'm sure that she'll tell you on what's wrong with her. Because I did noticed that she's been feeling sick lately and not sure on what's causing her to feel sick to her stomach though.\" Connie said. \"Right. But maybe KW could tell me, maybe.\" Carol said. \"Yeah, maybe.\" Connie said. When it was time to open one Christmas present for Max and Claire, KW looks at Carol thinking on what to say to him about her pregnancy, and so, she took a deep breath and starts to go over to Carol, holding her paw out to him, which Carol smiled and stands up and holds her hand. \"Carol honey, there's something that I have to tell you.\" KW said. \"What is it, sweetheart?\" Carol asked, feeling worried. \"Close your eyes.\" KW said with a smile. Carol closes his eyes gently, then, KW starts to put his paw on her stomach to feel the babies move or kick in her stomach. When Carol felt the kick and move from her stomach, his eyes open fast and he had a little gasp with a smile. \"I'm pregnant. There's more…I'm pregnant with twins.\" KW said. \"Really?\" Carol asked with a smile upon his face. \"Yep.\" KW said. \"I can't believe it. I'm going to a daddy again.\" Carol said with a laugh and gives KW a hug and a kiss. \"Angel is going to have baby brothers or sisters or both. Oh, KW…this is the best Christmas surprise ever.\" He added, and then he turned to Angel and picks her up with a smile. \"You hear that, Angel sweetie-pie? You're going to be a big sister; you're going to have two little siblings to play with. And Max is going to have two other Wild Thing siblings as well.\" They went over to the group, and they went to Max, Carol picks him up in his soft arms. \"Whoa!\" Max said with a smile. \"Max…KW and I, we have something that we want…to tell you.\" Carol said. \"Really? What is it?\" Max asked. \"Well, Max sweetie…You're going to have…two little Wild Thing siblings.\" KW said. \"Really?\" Max asked feeling surprised to hear the news that KW and Carol are expecting two little baby Wild Things. KW and Carol nod their heads. \"Wow! This is wonderful news, guys. I'm going to be a big brother.\" Max said with a smile upon his face and gives Carol and KW a hug and a kiss. \"We're glad that you're happy about the news, Max. We both love you so.\" Carol said with a smile and gives Max a hug. Connie goes over to Carol, KW and Max and she says, \"I see you told Max the news, did you, KW?\" \"Yep. Me and Carol sure did tell Max the news. And we'll tell the others the news tomorrow on Christmas Day.\" KW said. \"Good idea. Anyway, I just want to let you know that Santa Claus is coming. He's heading towards America, so I think its best that we should all get some sleep before Santa Claus comes. Max, care to do the honor on left out three cookies and a nice cup of cold milk out for Santa, please?\" Connie said. \"Yes, mom. I will do that.\" Max said, and goes to the kitchen, grab some oatmeal cookies and a nice cup of cold milk from the fridge and put it on the table in the living room, so Santa Claus will see it. \" All done.\" Max said. \"Good job, Max. I'm proud of you. How about you go along and go to bed? Good night, Max. Sweet dreams and I love you.\" Connie said. \"Sweet dreams to you too, mom. And I love you too.\" Max said and heads to bed with the Wild Things which they all end up in a one big sleeping pile. \"Good night, KW.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Carol.\" KW said. \"Good night, Ira.\" Carol said. \"Night.\" Ira said. \"Good night, Douglas.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Carol.\" Douglas said. \"Good night, Alexander.\" Carol said. \"Good night.\" Alexander said. \"Good night, Bull.\" Carol said. \"Good night, Carol.\" Bull said. \"Good night, Judith.\" Carol said. \"Good night.\" Judith said. \"Good night, Judy.\" Ira said. \"Good night, darling.\" Judith said. \"Good night, Max.\" KW said. \"Good night.\" Max said. \"Oh, good night, Max.\" Douglas said. \"Yeah, good night, Max.\" Ira said. \"Good night, Max.\" Carol said. \"Oh, this is nice on a Christmas Holiday.\" Douglas said. \"Good night, everybody. And everybody sweet dreams.\" Carol said. And they all went fast to sleep. Christmas Day came, and it started to snow from outside. Max was the first one to wake up, and noticed it's snowing outside, and he got up from his bed, and shouted, \"Hey guys, wake up, it's Christmas!\" The Wild Things woke up with Max's shout and they smiled and saw snow falling from the sky and its Christmas time. Max goes over to Claire's room and say, \"Claire, wake up, it's Christmas.\" And Max quietly wakes up his mom and tells her it's Christmas. She woke up with a smile, and they all went downstairs and saw lots of presents all over the place. \"Wow…I bet that Santa Claus knows that we're here, and I bet he left us presents too.\" Douglas said seeing all the presents. \"I believe so. Anyway, it's time for the Christmas Pickle tradition. Whoever finds it first, will be the first one to open a present first.\" Connie said. They all went over to the tree and search for the Christmas Pickle Ornament, until…Carol spotted the Christmas Pickle Ornament. \"Hey, I found the ornament.\" He said holding the ornament in his paw. \"Good job, Carol. Since you're the first one who found the ornament, you'll be the first one to open a present first.\" Connie said. \" Thanks, Connie. Also, everybody, me and KW, we have a very special announcement to make.\" Carol said with a smile. \"Max, care to do the honor to tell everyone the news, please?\" KW asked. \"Of course…KW is pregnant with twins.\" Max said to the other Wild Things. The Wild Things squealed and howled on hearing the special news that Carol and KW are expecting twins, and they all went over and did a group hug, and then…they all start on opening presents and did the stockings as well, and they got wonderful gifts from the holly jolly Santa Claus on Christmas Day. (This is a Christmas Special, and I hope you all will love it. The song Do They Know It's Christmas is singed by a group called Band-Aid, it's one of my favorite Christmas songs during the Christmas holidays. Please be sure to review this chapter, and there'll be more coming very soon whenever I'm not too busy. Also…this story is also for the one and only…James Gandolfini, who had passed away by a heart attack on June 19 th of 2013, which was very devastating to lose a favorite actor or family member by a heart attack, and do hope for God to have the power to bring back loved ones from the grave and wish that James Gandolfini was alive. Thank you.)[Chapter 22] (This is my new chapter for my Where the Wild Things Are 2 story. This is when Max introduces the Wild Things to the internet & also introduces them to a website that we all have or don't have, that is Facebook. My name; Rochelle is going to be in this chapter, who is a very good & supportive fan of Where the Wild Things Are movie & loves the scenes that has to do with Max & Carol, my boyfriend's name Marvin, including a good friend on Fanfiction; Krissy Brooke Alford (RaphLeoDonnieMikey4ever) is going to be in this chapter as well…Sorry for the long absence, I was busy throughout the whole time, because I had lots of stuff on my mind, like job training at Goodwill that I'm going to start in June or July, which I am nervous about, including my family may try to get me kicked out of the house if I don't do the job training. I've been helping my family taking care of the house & taking care of my great-grandmother who is in the last stages of Alzheimer's. Still, I hope you will like this chapter to this story, I still hope for a sequel to happen for the movie, as a special dedication to Maurice Sendak & James Gandolfini to honor them in their memories. Please be sure to review this chapter & I hope you will like it. Enjoy!) Chapter 22: Facebook & A New Friend The Wild Things have all stayed with Max & his family in Portland, Oregon; they all became a one big family. KW was getting close to her due date since she's pregnant again with Carol's cub or cubs which they are due in the springtime. However, Max was in his bedroom, sitting at his desk, takes out his laptop, turns it on, puts his password in, starts to go to Internet Explorer, then starts to go his Facebook account. When Max was on Facebook, Max saw that he has a new Friend Request, which someone send him a Friend Request to be accepted & be good friends with. He saw that the name of that person is Rochelle Norlund, a lovely lady who is a nice & supportive fan of the movie; Where the Wild Things Are directed by Spike Jonze himself. \" Wow, this Rochelle Norlund person sounds very good. She is very very supportive of the movie, and...What do you know? She also says she likes the scenes that have to do with me & Carol since me & Carol are like father & son figures to each other &….Wow, she is hoping for a sequel to happen for the movie. Wow, I bet she'll make a wonderful friend to me.\" Max said to himself, then starts to click the word; \"Confirmed\" & then starts to accept her. Later, Max told Carol & the other Wild Things about Rochelle Norlund; they start to feel very happy that they got a nice wonderful fan who likes the movie. \"Wow, this Rochelle person sounds very nice.\" KW said with a smile. \"Wow, that's incredible.\" Ira said. \"Wow, we all have a fan.\" Alexander said with a smile across his face. \"That sounds so very sweet.\" Judith said. \"This Rochelle person sounds too good to be true.\" Douglas said. Bull just smiled thinking that this Rochelle person is so nice & that she's a very good fan of the Wild Things & the movie. \" Wow. I can't wait to get to know this Rochelle Norlund.\" Carol said with a smile. \"Get this, guys…Rochelle says to me that Carol is her favorite Wild Thing.\" Max said. \"Ohh!\" KW, Judith, Ira, Alexander, Douglas & Bull all said at the same time & looked at Carol, who was looking down with a small nice smile. (If he was human, you'll notice that he'll be blushing.) \"Wow, I didn't know that I'm her favorite Wild Thing.\" Carol said with a smile & feels warm inside as well. \"Well, I was thinking; since I have Facebook, maybe I could let you guys be friends with her.\" Max said. \"Facebook? What's Facebook?\" Ira asked, feeling curious. \" Well, Facebook is like a huge website, which is on my laptop, &…Facebook is when people get to meet new people from other places. This Rochelle Norlund person is from Hampton, Virginia, she became interested in the movie that we did, which is Where the Wild Things Are since it came out on DVD in 2009. When she saw the movie, she was amazed by it & starts to believe that the island that you guys live is like a real place & feels so real, she was very amazed & surprised to see you guys up close while watching the movie. Also, the movie is based on the story book, written & made by Maurice Sendak, who is the author. He made & wrote the story book since back in the 1970s or 1980s & became popular.\" Max said. \" Whoa. I didn't know that there's a story book about us. I knew there's something special about this Rochelle person. I told you guys.\" Carol said, feeling so amazed on how Rochelle liked the movie. \"Also, Carol?\" Max asked. \"Mm-hm?\" Carol said while looking down at Max. \"Rochelle did tell me that she likes the scenes that have to do with you & me, because…she believes that we're like…father & son figures to each other. I believe that she's right, we are like father & son figures to each other, because we had such a very good friendship together.\" Max said. \"Aww. That's so very sweet. I can't wait to meet this Rochelle person on this Facebook website.\" Carol said with a smile. \"Come on, I'll help you get your first Facebook account.\" Max said then Carol starts to follow him upstairs to his bedroom. While Max & Carol were on the laptop, Max starts on helping Carol to make his own Facebook account, start on typing his personal stuff on what he does for a living, where he's from & many more, until, Carol starts to send Rochelle Norlund a friend request & Rochelle starts to accept him. \"Wow. This Rochelle Norlund is too good to be true. She is very supportive. Wow, look at all those photos of me & Max. Max is like my little human boy. Wow, she sends me a message, it says; Dear Carol, My name is Rochelle Norlund, I am a very good fan to you, you're my favorite Wild Thing, because in the movie that you & the other Wild Things did with Max, I always love the scenes that has to do with you & Max, you both are all like father & son figures to each other, both actors; Max Records & James Gandolfini did such a very good job on playing you guys for the movie. Not to make it sound crazy, I'm hoping for a sequel to happen for the movie. The problem is; Maurice Sendak says he won't do a sequel at all & tells people to go to h-e-l-l & also says that a sequel is a boring idea when he was on this show called; The Stephen Colbert Show. Still, to me, I think it's wrong for Maurice Sendak to say that, because I think a sequel is a wonderful idea & it's not boring at all, because I believe that all the people who also like the movie & storybook are curious to find out on what happens next with Max & the Wild Things & also are curious to find out if Max is going back to the island & see the Wild Things again for the second time. Still, I hope you & I can be very good friends, Carol. You're still very soft & very cuddly. However, we need someone to watch out for us. We humans have been looking for someone to love…a Wild Thing. We got to have faith, we got to believe in ourselves, look inside ourselves. The paw-prints of a Wild Thing can be a love, just like the footprints of an angel as well. If you step on the paw-prints of a Wild Thing, marvelous things can happen. I have seen it before when I watched the movie of Where the Wild Things Are. Sincerely, Rochelle Norlund. Carol was very surprised to read Rochelle's message that she sent to him on Facebook, he start to smile on how supportive she is to him & was also very shocked to hear that Maurice Sendak won't do a sequel to his book, just like Spike Jonze won't do a sequel to his movie either. He also starts to feel like Rochelle was right; the paw-prints of a Wild Thing are a love, just like the footprints of an angel. He starts to believe in himself, & starts to message her back, he says, Dear Rochelle, Thank you for the friend request, Max has told me & the other Wild Things about you, on how supportive you are to us & that you also love us as well, including hoping for a sequel to happen for the movie. I'm hoping for a sequel to happen too, I like your brain, Rochelle. Also, you do have a good heart & a good soul, you're very supportive & I love it very much. Of course we can be very good friends, also I will love you no matter what, because I am glad to have a nice fan & a wonderful friend like you. I love you so, Love, Carol. Carol finished his message & sends it to Rochelle on Facebook & lets out a nice peaceful sigh & heads out of Max's bedroom & spends some time with the other Wild Things. When Angel saw her daddy coming down, she gently lift her arms out ready to be picked up, Carol saw her & starts to pick her up & give her a kiss on the forehead. \"Daddy loves you, sweetie.\" Carol cooed at his little girl. KW, Claire, Judith & Connie smiled at that sweet touching moment, until, Claire starts to feel music coming into her mind & she starts to sing… Claire: Can't eat, can't sleep All I do is think about you KW: Hold on, what's this feelin' That's okay my baby, I don't want it back Connie: What's this chemistry, such intensity Judith: And good emotion gettin' through ALL: It's your sweet love, I'm feelin' it Can't get enough, go figure it Madly, deeply, baby I'm fallin' Head over heels, I'm livin' it Heart and soul, you're givin' it I'm thinkin' it I'm diggin' it Claire: Come on keep it comin' Think you're on to somethin' KW: So strong, so right, it's gotta be real Connie: You're beakin' down the walls and fences There's a powerful sense of Judith: Good emotion gettin' through ALL: It's your sweet love, I'm feelin' it Can't get enough, go figure it Madly, deeply, baby I'm fallin' Head over heels, I'm livin' it Heart and soul, you're givin' it I'm thinkin' it I'm diggin' it Claire: Ohhh!

Carol, Douglas, Alexander, Bull, Ira & Max were all surprised to see KW, Claire, Judith & Connie sing a very good song, they all start to cheer for them. \"Wow, that's a good song.\" Alexander said. \"Bravo.\" Douglas said. \"Wonderful.\" Ira said. \"That's incredible.\" Max said. \"Wow, girls. That's very good. You girls sound very good singing.\" Carol said. Bull just smiled & nods his head, as if he likes the song. \"Aw. Thank you, guys. It's just a song that came to Claire's mind.\" Connie said. \"Yeah, it's just a good song that came to my mind from my childhood days. Still, it did bring good memories.\" Claire said with a smile. Max starts to look up at Carol & whispers into his ear, \"What do you think of Rochelle?\" He asked. Carol whispered back, \"I say Rochelle is a very sweet wonderful woman & a very good supportive fan. I was very surprised that I'm her favorite Wild Thing. She did this, \"We need someone to watch out for us, we humans have been looking for someone to love…a Wild Thing. We got to have faith; we got to believe in ourselves, we need to look inside ourselves. The paw-prints of a Wild Thing can be a love, just like the footprints of an angel. If you step on the paw-prints of a Wild Thing, marvelous things can happen. Just like how you came to us for the first time & became a king to us all Wild Things.\" Max smiled on what Carol had told him on what Rochelle told Carol on Facebook, and then he believes that Rochelle is right as well. As the months went by, the Wild Things all have their Facebook accounts, thanks to Max who helped them, they became friends with so many people who love them & the movie as well, they also became friends with Rochelle's boyfriend; Marvin Deloatch Jr. who is also a very good fan to them as well. When spring came to Portland, Oregon; KW was getting close to her due date to have the cubs, until later, she starts to go into labor. KW says to Carol that it's time for the cubs, which causes Carol to get the other Wild Things, along with Max, Claire & Connie. \"Claire, stay here & keep little Angel entertained, while the rest of us help KW.\" Connie said. \"Sure. Come on, Angel, let's go have some fun.\" Claire said while holding Angel in her arms to go into the living room. Inside Carol & KW's bedroom, KW was on the bed, holding onto her stomach, breathing through the contractions which they have become intense & become stronger. Carol is holding onto her paw throughout the contractions, Max is on the other side holding onto her other paw to give her support. Ira & Alexander were holding her legs to give her baby cubs space to come out, Connie is in the middle between of KW's legs while sitting on Douglas' lap, so she could help KW get the cubs to come out, Judith & Bull were holding the blankets to get the cubs wrapped & cleaned. \"Okay, KW, do one big push. One…two…three. Push!\" Connie said while KW starts on pushing. Later, KW gave birth to two beautiful cubs, a boy & a girl. The boy looks just like Carol & has two small humps on his head which will soon become horns; the girl looks just like KW & has red hair. \"Wow, this little boy looks just like his daddy.\" Douglas said while holding the baby boy. \"This little girl looks just like her mommy.\" Judith said while holding the baby girl. Carol & KW looked at each other & shared a lovely kiss, until, Connie & Douglas hand over the happy cubs to their lovely parents. \"Have you guys thought about names?\" Max asked while looking at Carol & KW. Carol & KW looked at each other with a smile upon their eyes & looked at the other Wild Things, Max & Connie. \"We got good names. For the little boy, we'll name him; Marvin Maxwell. And for the little girl, we'll name her; Kristen Rochelle. We name them after our friends that we've met on Facebook, they are; Rochelle Norlund, Krissy Brooke Alford, Marvin Deloatch Jr. &…after you too, Max.\" KW said with a smile. Carol smiled at his beloved wife with small tears coming out of his eyes & nuzzled his wife. Claire bring in little Angel to meet her little siblings, Claire hand over Angel to Carol for her to meet her siblings. \"Angel sweetie, mommy & I want you to meet two special wild things…This is your baby brother; Marvin Maxwell & your baby sister; Kristen Rochelle…Marvin Maxwell & Kristen Rochelle, this is your sister; Angel.\" Carol said while holding Angel & little Marvin Maxwell. Angel gasped & starts to give her baby siblings a kiss on the forehead. \"Awwwww.\" The Wild Things, Max, Claire & Connie said at the same time when they saw that sweet touching moment. \"Max?\" Carol asked. \"Mm-hm?\" Max said while looked at Carol. \"You're still like a son to me, KW & I want you to be the big brother to Angel, Marvin Maxwell & Kristen Rochelle. Because I bet you still look up to me like a father figure.\" Carol said. \"Awwww, Carol. You're sweet.\" Max said with a smile & starts to give Carol a hug & starts to hear Carol purr. Carol was hugging Max with a smile upon his face & while purring as well. (This chapter has to do with the Wild Things start to have Facebook & KW gave birth two beautiful cubs; Marvin Maxwell & Kristen Rochelle. There's one song in this chapter, it's called: I'm Diggin' It, singed by Alecia Elliott. That song brings good memories of my childhood when it comes to Country Music. Please be sure to review this chapter, I hope you all will love it. Thank you.)

Wow, it's been a while since I've posted anything. But, luckily for me, the poll on my profile page was a success (sorta). And after two votes saying yes, I have decided to post a fanfic for Where The Wild Things Are. I thought that maybe it'd be interesting if Max had an older sister and see what her part in the story would be. But then I found out that he already has one in the movie. So after a few days of thinking I'd have to scrap this, I finally decided to work around it. So now he has two older sisters. His other sister (my OC) is named Bella (the name inspired after my amazing friend Isabella from a camp I attended last summer, not Bella from the Twilight series), and the story is pretty much the ups and downs of their life from the time Max is born to sometime after the movie ends (plus his already existing sister is older in this story). Most of this will be told from Bella's POV, but a few chapters will be from Max's, and maybe one or two will be when he's on the island with the Wild Things. Trust me...this story is more along the lines of family relationships, and please know that the story probably won't have a lot of action (i.e. it doesn't get more exciting than family fights and Max biting people), so please BE NICE. This is a first for me, and like I've said in some of my other stories, please no flames or bashing. Constructive criticism is encouraged. And in the event that this story totally sucks and no one likes it, I will remove it. No questions asked. Yes, parts of the movie will be in this story. But there are parts before, during, and after that I added in (hence being original). DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANYTHING. All rights belong to Maurice Sendak and Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers and all those other cool dudes who made this awesome story into what it is today. So…what are you waiting for? Read on and enjoy![Chapter 2] Prologue: Lucky? When her mother and father told her she was going to be a big sister, the excitement that welled up in young Isabella Carson was almost overwhelming. Being six at the time, she thought it was going to be the best thing ever. Until it actually happened. ... It was only a few weeks after she'd received the news that her excitement level began to decrease. All anyone wanted to talk about was the baby, or something related to the baby. Her mom and dad were both busy with work and preparations for the baby. Even her older sister, Claire, seemed mildly enthused. And she made sure that if anyone talked about her new sibling – which was often – that she was in her room or in her tree house, where she wouldn't have to hear anything. It wasn't fun at all. Claire, her only companion, wasn't bothered in the least. \"I had to go through it when you were born,\" she said. \"It only gets worse from here, so get used to it.\" To make things worse, her parents came home one day with the exceptional news that the baby was a boy. Automatically, Bella knew that she and the baby weren't going to get along with each other. Her best friend Tori had two little brothers, and she got along with them as well as a flea gets along with an itchy dog. So for the next nine months, she anxiously awaited her baby brother's arrival. ... She was exactly seven years, three days and eleven hours old when Max finally came into her life. She always remembered exactly because her mother wouldn't let her soon forget it. She claimed that their birthdays were \"lucky\" – Bella was born on October 13 th , then three days later, Max was born on the 16 th , and they would always be seven years apart. Whatever having \"lucky\" birthdays meant, it didn't have any special meaning to Bella. If anything, having a little brother like Max was un lucky. Everyone thought he was so cute and perfect, and all during the get-togethers people had for his birth, Bella was off in the corner, sulking that she was getting no attention. \"You just gotta suck it up until it all blows over,\" Claire would tell her, \"so get used to it.\" Like Bella had predicted before he'd been born, Max was always getting in the way, and she seemed to get blamed for a lot more than she had before he came along. And though her mother would make her play with him on occasion, it wouldn't be long before the two of them would need to be separated. Her mother claimed it was \"just a phase\" and that \"you'll appreciate each other more when you're older, Isabella\". Bella thought she knew enough about grownups to realize that her mother was just trying to appease her. But as the next nine years of her life played out before her, she never would have guessed that she could actually get along well with her new little brother.[Chapter 3] Hola! Thanks to Pricat for reviewing! I'm really glad you liked it! I don't know how often updates will be...it depends on homework and my after school stuff, but since I've already got a rough copy of the first few chapters done, the first couple of updates will be on pretty fast. Enjoy! ... THREE YEARS LATER... ... Chapter One: Complications \"Guys, don't fight. It's a tricycle built for two. Or…one built for two-and-a-half…\" Two men on an Aqua Bike struggled to keep their balance, and then promptly flipped it over, tumbling into the water. Bella couldn't help but letting out a shriek of her obnoxiously loud laugh. \"Bella! Could you please keep it down? Your brother's trying to sleep!\" \"Okay, Mom,\" Bella called back, turning back to the TV. \"…by watching something frivolous, like people spinning to classical music! Yeah…that'll be good…\" Once again, Bella couldn't stop herself from laughing uncontrollably at the home videos of different people and animals spinning in circles, all set to a classical tune. America's Funniest Home Videos never failed to entertain her. A chubby little boy toddled out and stood with his hands on his hips. \"Hey!\" he said. \"Mommy said stop it! I'm twying to sweep!\" \"I'm not even being that loud, Max. Stop being such a baby and go back to bed.\" \"I can't!\" He stood right in front of the TV. \"Yo not being vewy nice! I'm telling Mommy, and she gonna put you in time-out!\" Bella rolled her eyes. At three years old, her little brother didn't grasp the concept that she was too old for \"time-out\". \"Max, move. I'm trying to watch.\" \"No!\" He folded his tiny arms in defiance. \"Max,\" Bella said, getting angry. \"Move your fat butt outta here!\" \"Mommy!\" Max called, tears forming in his little brown eyes. \"Belly called me fat!\" \"He's not moving! He's blocking the TV! He's being annoying, like he always is!\" Their mother, Connie, came down the hallway, a frown crossing her face. \"Bella, that's no way to talk to your brother.\" She picked him up and continued to glare at her daughter. \"He was blocking the TV again—\" Bella started. \"He's just a baby! He doesn't know any better! And he needs his sleep. Now turn off the TV and go to bed. I'll be there to tuck you in in a few minutes.\" Bella pounded her thumb on the power button as she watched the TV flicker off. She stormed up the stairs and down the hallway and got ready for bed, angry thoughts running across her mind. Stupid Max…why did Mom and Dad have to have him in the first place? He's not that great…he's just an annoying little nuisance! After brushing her teeth and putting on her pajamas, she got into bed and pulled the covers over her head. A few minutes later, she heard Connie come through the door. \"Bella?\" Bella didn't move. \"Bella…\" She stayed perfectly still, saying nothing. \"Isabella Kaye,\" came her mother's stern tone. \"What?\" Bella asked. She knew that if Connie was using her full first name and middle name, she meant business. She felt the covers be removed from her head. She looked up and saw Connie. \"Bella…I'm sorry.\" \"Whatever. Just…leave me alone.\" Bella rolled over. \"I don't wanna talk about it.\" Connie sighed. \"I know it's hard, with Daddy being away…\" Bella wished she would just leave. She hated it when her mother brought up her father. \"But he and I are…going through a tough time at the moment. And I know how hard it is for you kids to live here without him.\" Just stop talking about it…please… \"I hear you guys on the phone at night,\" Bella said quietly. \"You keep telling me that you're working things out, but it sounds like you're just yelling at each other and not fixing anything. And Claire says that you're gonna get a…D-Force…\" She tried to work her way around the strange, new word. Connie was silent before she kissed Bella on the forehead. \"It's a divorce , honey, and Claire shouldn't say things like that. I'll have a talk with her about it. I promise you, Bella, things will turn out in the end,\" she said. \"Even if it doesn't seem like it now…it will soon.\" She turned out the light and shut the door. Bella rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling. Being practically ten-and-three-quarters, she was smart enough to know that grownups always said things would \"turn out in the end\" just to calm down their kids. But Bella knew better. She'd heard her parents on the phone. And she knew where this would end.[Chapter 4] Thanks again to Pricat for reviewing! Any real-world franchises I may use (like AFV)...I obviously don't own them. Trust me...if I did, I wouldn't be on this site...jk, jk... Enjoy! Chapter Two: Making Adjustments The next morning, Bella sat at the breakfast table, exhausted from tossing and turning half the night. Claire was looking at a gossip magazine while she munched on some toast, and Max sat in a booster seat, eagerly banging his spoon on the wood of the table. \"Maxie want seal-ial!\" he chanted. \"Maxie want seal-ial!\" Bella glared at him, but said nothing. \"Heard you got in trouble last night, Iz,\" Claire commented, using a nickname Bella did not particularly like. \"None of your beeswax, Claire,\" Bella grumbled. \"Well, I'll have you know that I, unlike you, went straight to bed when I was told last night. In fact, Mom says I get to stay up a half-hour later now that I'm older.\" Claire smiled to herself in satisfaction. \"Wow, a whole half-hour,\" Bella said sarcastically. \"Quick, someone call the newspaper! We wouldn't want the whole world to live without the knowledge that Claire Carson gets to go to bed later than usual!\" She could never resist the urge to talk back to her older sister. \"You're just jealous,\" Claire said. \"Mom says I have responsibility, as oppose to you.\" \"I'm responsible…\" Bella defended weakly. \"Let's think…I'm a whole two years older than you. That means I have two years of experience over your head, Iz. Let's face it: I'm much more responsible.\" Bella hated it when her sister got technical with her. She used to be fun, always willing to play Barbie dolls or house whenever Bella asked. But ever since Claire had started middle school, she had become a snob and decided that she was too good for her younger sister (she would be willing to play with Max for a certain amount of time each day, but Bella knew that when Max got older, Claire would ignore him, as well). \"Good morning, sunshine,\" Connie said to Bella. \"I made you your favorite: chocolate-chip pancakes and bacon.\" The plate of steaming food was set in front of her. \"Nepotism…\" Claire sang in Bella's ear. \"Claire…\" Connie warned. \"Bella had a hard time sleeping. She needs her energy today.\" Max eyed Bella's plate hungrily. \"Maxie want what Belly's having!\" he declared. \"Sweetheart, you can't have pancakes. You get mashed bananas.\" \"Maxie tiwed of bo-nan-as! Maxie want pamcwakes!\" \"When you're older, honey,\" Connie said tiredly, giving Max a bowlful of mashed-up bananas. \"Maxie no want bo-nan-as!\" Max shrieked, banging the bowl on the table. \"Maxie want pamcwakes!\" \"Max, please,\" Connie said, tying his bib on. \"Eat your breakfast.\" \"NO! MAXIE WANT PAMCWAKES!\" Max threw the bowl across the table, where it landed on Bella's head. Max started laughing. \"Belly has a new hat!\" \"Banana yellow isn't really your color, Iz,\" Claire said, stifling a giggle. \"Max!\" Connie scolded. \"That's a no-no! We do not throw our breakfast, Max!\" Bella fought to keep her anger inside, but found that it was near impossible. \"Max, what the heck?! You always have to make things harder, don't you?\" \"Bella, it was an accident,\" Connie said, wiping the bananas off her daughter's face with paper towels. \"Everything with him is an accident,\" Bella growled. \"No, let me take that back. He is an accident!\" \"Isabella!\" Connie said. \"Don't say that.\" \"Mommy,\" Max asked, \"whas a axweeden?\" \"It means that you didn't mean for something to happen, but it did,\" Claire said, her eyes on her magazine. \"Thank you, Claire,\" Connie said, rolling her eyes. \"Bella, say you're sorry to your brother.\" Bella couldn't believe what she was hearing. She hadn't done anything. Connie had it the wrong way around. Max should apologize to her . \"No.\" \"Bella…please tell him you're sorry.\" She wasn't going to let it go that easily. \"Isn't it pointless?\" \"And why would it be pointless?\" \"Because I'm not sorry I did it!\" Bella exclaimed. \"I honestly meant what I said.\" She wouldn't give up without a fight. It was Max's fault this time. Anyone could see that. Anyone, apparently, except her mother. \"Okay, that's it. If you're going to act like a two-year-old, I'm going to treat you like one.\" Connie pointed upstairs. \"Go get in the bathtub and wash the bananas out of your hair, and after that, go to your room and don't come out for the rest of the day.\" Bella got up and pushed her chair in, hoping to make a dent in the side of the table. She walked out of the room. \"See ya, Iz,\" Claire called after her. \"Bye, Belly!\" Max said cheerfully. Bella almost turned around and threw the mush from her hair at them, but Connie followed her, and wouldn't stand for any more brawling. After finally getting all the bananas out of her hair, Bella changed into her day clothes and sat on the floor, sticking her lower lip out. \"Are you satisfied now?\" she asked Connie. \"Satisfied with what?\" \"Ruining my life.\" Connie sighed and sat next to her. \"Bella, this can't go on. This constant talking back…and fighting with your brother and sister…you need to control yourself.\" \"At least I'm being civil. It's not like I'm running around like a crazed maniac.\" \"You know what I mean,\" Connie said. \"You need to start shaping up. I'm honestly worried about you. You're going to have a hard time in life if you keep this up.\" \"Dad said it was good that I stand up for myself,\" Bella said, looking at her mother out of the corner of her eye. \"Not when it comes to your elders, sweetie. You need to respect them.\" \"Even if they're wrong?\" \"Even if they're wrong.\" Connie stood up. \"I'm going to leave you alone to think about what you did.\" She walked out of the room, and Bella heard her footsteps on the stairs. Bella had no intention of \"thinking about what she did\". She was older now; her mother couldn't keep her in her room all day. In about an hour, she'd be out of here.[Chapter 5] Hey! This chapter's kind of a filler...Idk, I just thought it'd be interesting. Oh, and if you haven't noticed, a lot of this is a bit angsty. Sorry if it is. And if this one totally sucks, please let me know and I can avoid making future chapters like this one. Oh, and I don't own the following movie. Trust me...if I did, I'd be a gazillionaire right now...lol. And sorry if this is super long... ... Chapter Three: Ship of Dreams Wait. Watch. Hope. Nothing. Repeat. Bella laid her head against her doorway, wishing her mother would come by to tell her that she could come out. She had been in her room all day. She was too old for this kind of punishment. \"Can I come out now?\" she'd ask, feeling like a toddler. \"You know the rules, Bella,\" her mother would call. Hours passed, and she was fidgety. \" Please can I come out?\" \"No, Bella.\" More time went by. \" Now can I come out?\" Her mother didn't answer. She was most likely tuning her out. \"This isn't fair!\" Bella slammed her fists on her bedroom floor. Giving up her watch post, she sprawled out on the floor and began to sob. \"Belly?\" Max appeared suddenly. \"Why awe you on the flow like that? Are you twying to be a angel?\" Bella turned to face him, her eyes burning with hate. \"Max, get out.\" \"Maxie want to play, too!\" He lay on the floor and spread his arms and legs wide. \"Look, Belly! Maxie a angel, too!\" \"Go away, Max!\" She shut the door. A few seconds later, he knocked. \"Maxie want to come in!\" \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" Bella screamed at the top of her lungs. She heard Connie's footsteps outside. \"Max,\" came the sound of her muffled voice. \"Leave your sister alone. She's not in a good mood right now.\" \"I heard that!\" Bella called. Connie opened the door. \"Bella, please. He didn't know any better.\" \"Well, let me know when he starts to know better. Cause when he does, then he can actually get in trouble.\" \"If you keep talking like that, you'll stay in here longer,\" Connie warned as she closed the door and walked away. Bella got up off the floor and crawled onto her bed. She laid face down and cried some more, and before she knew it, she was fast asleep. ... It wasn't until close to nine at night that Bella woke up. She looked around and saw that it was dark. Still a bit sleepy, she dug out her pajamas and put them on. She was about to go brush her teeth when she remembered that she wasn't allowed to leave. Maybe I should just do it. It's just brushing my teeth. Mom'll be happy that I'm concerned with keeping my mouth healthy. Besides, it'll be nice to get out of here… She sighed. Her face still felt stiff from crying, which reminded her of what had happened earlier. She didn't want Connie to have another reason to be angry with her. It would just mean more time in her room. I'll just ask. Mom will appreciate that…I think, she thought as she snuck downstairs. She was shocked by what she saw. Displayed on the TV was a young red-haired woman with a fancy dress on. She was hanging off the edge of a boat, positioning herself to jump. She was really high up, it looked… \"Mom! What are you watching?\" Bella exclaimed, terrified. Her mother hit the pause button on the remote and turned around. \"Bella, what are you doing out of your room?\" Bella suddenly remembered. \"I wanted to know if I could go brush my teeth.\" Connie gave her a look. \"Was that just an excuse to come out?\" \"No,\" Bella said, knowing that her mother's accusation was half-true. \"I honestly wondered if it would be okay.\" \"Of course it is. Mundane things like that are always okay. But as soon as you're done, it's back to your room,\" Connie said. \"Alright, Mom,\" Bella said as she walked back up the stairs. As she brushed her teeth, Bella couldn't shake the terrible image she'd seen. What was that lady thinking? She's going to die if she jumps off that boat! Why would Mom be slightly interested in something like that? She was about to go back in her room when she stopped. Maybe she could sneak back down and watch a few more minutes of the movie. It wouldn't hurt…how long could it be, anyway? ... \"Belly?\" Bella turned to see Max standing on the stairs next to her. \"Shhh!\" she hissed. \"Not now, Max! Go back to bed!\" \"Is Belly hiding from Mommy?\" Max asked loudly. \"Max! Keep it down!\" she whispered. \"Mommy! Look! Belly's on the staywas!\" Bella groaned as her mother turned to look. \"Isabella Kaye! What do you think you're doing?\" Bella froze on the steps, where she had been sitting for a while. \"I'm…um…\" she stammered. She couldn't cover up for this one. \"Go to your room right now! This movie is not appropriate for you!\" How so? she wanted to ask. All that had happened while she had been watching was a spitting contest, a boring formal dinner, and a wild party. At most, the movie looked like it was PG. \"As for you, Max,\" Connie said, taking on a gentler tone. \"You need to go to sleep.\" \"But Maxie want to see, too! Maxie wants Barney!\" \"In the morning, Max,\" Connie said, picking him up and carrying him back to his room. Bella slowly made her way back up the stairs after them, somewhat annoyed that she'd been busted. The movie was actually really interesting; she didn't know its name, but she was sure it was based on something that had happened a long time ago. She lay in bed for a while, waiting for the perfect moment when her mom would pause the movie – and Max was asleep – so she could sneak back down to watch more. ... \"Mother, don't you get it?\" Rose, the red-haired lady, said to an older woman that looked like her. \"There aren't enough boats. Half of the people on this ship are going to die!\" \"Not the better half…\" a smooth looking man beside her mumbled. Bella gripped the railing. Things were starting to look bad for the people in the movie. Now that the ship was sinking and there weren't enough lifeboats, she was almost compelled to go back to her room. But something kept her there on the steps… ... After Jack froze to death, she decided enough was enough. She once again trudged up the stairs, very upset indeed. A while later, Connie was in her room, tucking her in. \"Mom? What was that movie you were watching?\" \"You mean we ?\" Bella didn't meet her mother's gaze. \"How'd you know?\" \"You should've been more quiet coming down the stairs the third time,\" she answered, smiling. \"And, to answer your first question, Titanic . It's based on a true story about a ship that hit an iceberg and sank on its first voyage.\" Bella vaguely recalled learning about the ship in the first grade. She had thought it was a bit depressing, but now that she'd seen all those people fall off the ship or catch pneumonia…it was almost more than she could take. \"All those people died?\" \"Not the actors in the movie, but yes, a lot of innocent people died on that ship. It was a very sad thing to happen.\" Bella was now a bit worried. What if she went on a boat as big as the Titanic ? What if it hit an iceberg and there weren't enough lifeboats? Would she die going down with the ship? Or freeze to death in the water? \"Bella, it happened a long time ago. They've made sure that something that tragic won't happen again,\" Connie explained, as if reading her thoughts. \"Don't worry.\" \"Okay,\" she said, sounding unsure. \"Good night,\" Connie said, kissing Bella on the forehead. \"If you need me during the night, my room's right down the hallway.\" Bella nodded, knowing that by the end of the night, she probably wouldn't be in her own bed.[Chapter 6] Hey! Sorry it's been a while! This week's been kinda busy for me. And sorry if this is a bit choppy...it's a filler... ... C hapter Four: The Tree House It dominated her thoughts for a whole week. Bell tried to think about other things, but she finally found that to be useless. Every time she thought of something, it always led back to that stupid movie. Pancakes. Syrup. Drowning. Water. Titanic . Max. Playing. Legos. Boat. Titanic . Family. Forest. Lake. Swimming. Titanic . She couldn't shake the spooky feeling she got every time she thought about it. She considered telling her mother, but was afraid Connie would say, \"I told you that movie wasn't appropriate for you.\" After a while, though, she began to find that she was growing fond of the film's music. She checked out the CD from the library and listened to it every afternoon. Her favorite song was the Love Theme, and she was thrilled to find that half of the songs contained the haunting, beautiful melody. For the first time in a long time, Bella felt genuinely happy. Her family – save Max, who was too little to understand – was a little concerned with her drastic change in behavior, but she didn't pay them any mind. As long as she was in her own world, it seemed as if nothing horrible could ever happen. ... One Monday morning later that summer, Bella walked downstairs to see that the living room had been emptied of all of its furniture. Connie then explained to her three children that some men were coming to clean the carpet today, and the furniture needed to be moved. This also meant that they needed to stay outside for a good portion of the day. Bella sat on the front steps, wondering what to do, because there was no one to play with. She would have walked the four short blocks to be with her best friend, Tori, but she'd gone to Arizona for the summer. She wouldn't even bother with Claire; her older sister had already stated she was going out with her friends. She thought of Max, but then chastised herself for even considering him as an option. She looked up at the old oak tree that dominated half of their front yard. Sitting in the crooks of some of the branches was the tree house her dad had built when she turned five. It was made of old wooden boards and even had a deck, and made a creak-creak sound when she walked on the floor. It'd been a few years since she'd been up there. Why not? I have nothing better to do… She climbed the rungs that were nailed into the tree, and stood on the deck, staring out over the housetops and into the distance. It was as if she were flying… She smiled to herself. She knew exactly what she was doing today. ... \"Bella, why the heck are you up there?\" Bella opened her eyes and dropped her arms, annoyed that Claire had crashed her train of thought. \"I'm trying to have fun.\" Claire raised an eyebrow. \"Looked more like you were being weird, but, whatever. If Mom asks where I am, tell her I went off with Dana and I'll be home later.\" \"Don't you wanna stay here? We can play Ship. I can go get our dolls, and then we can save them from sharks and stuff.\" \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" Claire said, turning onto the sidewalk. \"See ya, Iz.\" Bella wondered what she'd been thinking, what had made her suggest playing with Claire. They both wanted their space, and it was a good thing not to get involved with that. \"I am Victoria Sanford,\" Bella said out loud to herself. \"The richest lady on board the great Titanic . None shall tell me what to do. I make my own rules.\" She spread her arms wide, like an eagle, imagining the vast ocean beneath a gigantic ship hull. This must be what it was like for Rose and Jack— \"Belly?\" Bella looked down to see Max, toy truck in hand. Her mind went blank for the second time that day. \"What, Max? Can't you see I'm busy?\" \"Claywa isn't hewa,\" Max said. \"Whew she go?\" \"She went to go play with her friends,\" Bella told him. \"Now, can you please go back to your trucks? I'm busy.\" \"Can I come up?\" Max asked eagerly. \"Maxie want to fly, too!\" \"This is a big kid's game, Max,\" Bella said. \"It's not for little kids like you.\" \"But Maxie has no one to play with!\" Max started to pout, dropping his truck and folding his arms. \"Maxie wants to play with Belly.\" \"Not now, Max. Mom says it's dangerous for you to be up here.\" \"Maxie want to come up!\" He stomped his foot. \"Maxie want to fly like Belly!\" \"Go away, Max!\" Bella barked, losing her temper. \"I don't want to play with you!\" Max's eyes suddenly grew big. He picked up his truck and hung his head, all the while sniffling. He trudged into the back yard, looking back only once. Good riddance. He needs to learn when to quit. Bella resumed her position, leaning her head back, almost feeling the sea air fly past. She began to hum the song that she now knew by heart. She didn't have the best voice, which was why she usually refrained from singing and left all of the musical aspects to Claire, who was much more talented. But today, she wasn't Bella. She was Victoria Sanford. Let anyone hear her and think what they wanted. She could order them to walk the plank or be thrown into the lower compartments of the ship. \"I am invincible,\" she whispered to herself. And as she sailed on her imaginary ship for the rest of the afternoon, things finally seemed to be going right.[Chapter 7] Hey, y'all! Sorry...this week's been sooooooo busy for me! I feel horrible about not updating! The story's gonna change pace just a bit now. If you guys think that this story's going to fast, just let me know, and I'll try to slow it down a little. Happy Halloween! =) ... A FEW MONTHS LATER… ... Chapter Five: A Promise Made Bella sat quietly in her brother's room late one night, listening at the closed door. Her parents were fighting in the kitchen, and she felt better sitting with someone else in the room. She could hear them, all right…but she couldn't make out what, exactly, they were saying. All she knew was that it wasn't good. True to her previous guess, her parents' fighting had gotten worse over time instead of better. Bella would find herself up in the middle of the night, awakened by their angry voices. The only way she got back to sleep was to hum the soothing Love Theme to herself. But even that hadn't worked this time. \"You had to go and be selfish…\" she said out loud to herself. \"Belly?\" came a voice quietly from the closet. The voice startled her. Bella cautiously walked over and opened the closet door to see her little brother curled up in one of the corners. His face was wet from crying, and his nose was running slightly. Normally, seeing him like this would cause eye rolling and scoffing, and maybe even a \"What a baby\" if she was extremely aggravated. But, somehow…under the circumstances…the sight of him caused the anger to be slowly sucked out of her, leaving her with an aching heart. She was no longer focusing on the things he did ; she was really seeing him for the first time. \"Max?\" He stared up at her with his big brown eyes and said nothing. \"Max…\" \"I heard yelling,\" he said in a small voice. \"I got scared. I heard feetsteps, so I'm hiding.\" Bella felt guilty for a second. Max had probably heard her footsteps in the hallway coming towards his room, mistaking them for their parents'. She had been so scared herself she hadn't even thought to check if he was awake or not. \"Max,\" she said again. \"No one's coming. Mommy and Daddy aren't coming to yell at you, okay?\" Max didn't look convinced. \"They don't love me anymore, Belly,\" he said as more tears fell across his face. Bella felt the pain in her heart worsen. \"Max, they don't hate you.\" \"Then why are they fighting on my birfday?\" Bella couldn't say anything. It was true that today was Max's forth birthday – a milestone in a person's life, according to their mother. And since Bella's had been three days earlier, it had been decided that there would be a joint party. Their whole extended family had been invited, including their dad. It had all gone somewhat smoothly – until everyone left and the five of them remained. Claire, Bella and Max had been sent to bed early, and a few hours later was when Bella had heard the argument and had moved to her brother's room, knowing Claire would not enjoy company this late at night. \"That's why they're yelling. They don't love me,\" Max repeated. \"Max…\" Bella climbed into the closet and sat next to her brother. \"Mommy and Daddy love you. They love the three of us.\" He said nothing. He just looked at her, his eyes flooded with tears. \"Would you feel better if I slept in here?\" He didn't move for a minute. Then he nodded. \"Alright. Let's go.\" She got up and crawled out of the closet. \"But…what if they don't stop?\" \"We can't do anything about it,\" Bella said grudgingly. \"All we can do is try to get to sleep.\" He sat in the closet for a moment longer before coming out and crawling into bed. Bella walked to the door. \"Where are you going?\" Max asked, clutching his blankets. \"I'm gonna go get my stuff. I'll be right back, okay?\" Max nodded, the fear in his eyes still prominent. Bella tiptoed out of the room to retrieve her pillow, a blanket, and her plush dog Sally. She tried not to listen to her parents as she went on her errand, but it was hard not to. The more she tried, the harder it became. So she made sure she was quick. When she came back, Max was sitting straight up in bed, looking at her. He kept watching her as she laid her stuff on the floor. \"What are you doing?\" \"Max, I'm not sleeping on that bed. I'm too big. And there's not enough room.\" She watched in astonishment as he grabbed his pillow, a blanket, and his teddy bear and set them up on the floor, similar to how she had hers. \"I don't wanna sleep all by myself,\" he said. \"Would it be okay if I was down here?\" \"Of course,\" Bella said, shocked. \"Why wouldn't it be okay?\" Max laid down and looked up at her, tears already forming in his eyes again. \"You're like Mommy and Daddy. You don't love me.\" The pain in her chest was like a fire now. Usually, she would disregard this comment. But she wasn't like that any longer. She stared dumbly at him, speechless. \"W-What?\" she said, finding her voice after a minute. \"You never give me hugs,\" he said simply, tears gently falling down his face. \"And you yell a lot, too. I hear you talk to Mommy sometimes. And you sound mean. You sound like you don't love me.\" Bella couldn't breathe. This was what her baby brother thought about her? \"Max…\" Her voice was barely a whisper as she wrapped her arms around him. \"I'm sorry. I…I know I sound that way…but it's only because I get angry.\" \"You're angry a lot, then,\" Max decided. \"Yeah,\" Bella said, the thought finally dawning on her as she let go. \"I am, aren't I?\" Max blinked, his tears slowly disappearing. \"You just have to remember that everyone gets angry sometimes. Grown-ups like Mommy and Daddy get angry. Brothers and sisters, and even grandparents get angry. But that doesn't mean they don't love each other. I promise you that no matter what, Mommy and Daddy and Claire and I love you very, very much, Max.\" Max still didn't look completely convinced, but he seemed to be understanding. A small smile appeared through his crying. \"I love you, Belly,\" he said, giving her a quick hug before lying down. \"I love you, too, Max,\" she answered, getting comfortable. She quickly wiped away the tears she realized were sitting at the rim of her eyes. As she tried to tune out her parents' excessive bickering, she sensed something was different. She opened her eyes to see her little brother snuggled up to her, fast asleep. She kissed him on the head. \"'Night, Max,\" she said, drifting off to sleep.[Chapter 8] Hey! Sorry about the delayed update...finals were this week, and I had a ton of other stuff going on, leaving me no time to update, obviously. But, luckily, I have a three-day weekend, so I'll have time for some updating! Yay! P.S. I'll apologize in advance if this chapter sucks. I typed this in a drowsy state of mind (a.k.a. I had just woken up and my mind hadn't really caught up with me), so if it sounds like I was drunk, you now know why. P.P.S. This is the first chapter from Max's POV. I tried to get into the mind of a four-year-old, but considering I don't live with a four-year-old boy, it was a bit hard. But I tried my best. And once again, if I completely screwed it up, I'm always open to suggestions. ... Chapter Six: Family Secrets \"Where is she?\" \"How should I know?\" \"You're her father!\" \"And I'm supposed to do everything?\" His parents' yelling rudely awakened Max. He had been having a very pleasant dream; he'd been fighting off a dinosaur, and there had been a band of vampires behind him, ready to intervene at any given moment. Now that he was fully awake, he was suddenly fearful. He didn't like it when his mom and dad fought like this. He didn't understand why they couldn't be nice to each other, like he and Bella were. He took in his surroundings, realizing he was on the floor. He remembered last night, and smiled. He no longer had to be afraid of his older sister. Now they could be friends, and she could play with him and Claire, and they could all be together. Why couldn't his mom and dad be like that, too? Max looked over and saw that Bella was still fast asleep. He wondered why she wasn't awake, why she wasn't bothered by the fighting. He figured that she must have been very tired from being up for a good portion of the night, listening to their parents. \"Why are you guys so freaked?\" came Claire's voice from the hallway. \"Claire, your sister has apparently gone missing,\" Connie informed her. \"And, your father has no idea where she's gone.\" \"The kids live with you , Connie. You should know where she is!\" \"Geez, you guys!\" Claire exclaimed. \"She's in Max's room!\" Silence filled the hallway. Max took this as a good thing. \"What?\" \"She's in Max's room,\" Claire repeated. \"I heard her sneak in there last night. She's been in there ever since.\" Her footsteps were on the stairs now. \"Probably went in there to escape your bickering.\" No sound came from the hallway. Max breathed a sigh of relief. It didn't last for long. The doorknob to his room was slowly turning, signaling that his mom and dad would be there in a matter of seconds. Max knew that if they saw he was up, they'd start asking him questions. He didn't like it when they did that. Most of the time, they used words he didn't understand. So he lay back down and snuggled closer to Bella, pretending to be asleep. Right on cue, his parents came in. Or, at least, he heard them come in. \"Oh, my…\" Connie trailed off. \"Would you look at that?\" his dad said. \"They're…\" \"…not fighting,\" Connie finished, amazed. \"This is…a miracle.\" Max was happy that his parents weren't yelling anymore. And he also felt proud of himself for making peace with Bella, for it seemed to stop the fighting. \"Should we wake them up?\" his dad asked. Max almost expected his mom to start yelling again, but she didn't. \"No,\" she said quietly. \"We'll wait for them to wake up.\" \"But…I'd like to talk to Bella—\" \"We'll wait for them to wake up,\" Connie repeated firmly. Their footsteps sounded again, and then the door closed. Max opened one eye, then the other. They were gone. It was safe to sit up now. As he did, Bella began to stir. She opened her eyes and looked up at him. \"Hey, Max,\" she said sleepily. \"Hi, Belly,\" he said. She smiled. \"You sleep okay?\" \"Yeah. Did you?\" \"Mmm-hmm,\" she fibbed, yawning and stretching. \"I woke up a few times, but I went back to sleep eventually. Were Mom and Dad in here? I thought I heard someone.\" \"Yeah. They just left. They were scared. They didn't know where you were.\" \"Oh.\" Bella looked guilty. \"I'd better go tell them what happened.\" She got up. \"Come on, Max.\" Max got up and scurried after his sister, hoping things wouldn't get too out of hand. ... The rest of the morning passed very smoothly. Their parents apologized for upsetting them, and promised to keep their tempers low around them. Max noticed that Bella was about to say something to their mom, but closed her mouth before she said anything. Breakfast was fairly quiet. Max had graduated from mashed bananas to cut-up bananas, and he couldn't wait for the day when he was ready for what he called \"people\" food. He spent the rest of the day drawing monsters and dragons and anything else he could think of. Connie was in her office, working, and Claire had, once again, gone off with her friends. His dad had taken Bella out that day for special \"father-daughter\" time. When they got back, Max raced to meet them. \"Daddy! Belly! Come look at what I drawed!\" His dad was very impressed with Max's drawings, but Bella seemed very sullen. And even after his dad left, Bella wouldn't talk to anybody. She stared at the ground, or zoned out, deep in thought. Max was worried. What if she was sick? Or maybe she was going to live with their dad and wouldn't come back? Burdened with these questions, he decided to ask her. \"Belly? Is everything okay?\" She blinked a few times, signaling that she was a bit surprised at his approach. \"Oh. Yeah. Sure.\" \"Are you sure? You seem sad.\" \"I'm alright, Max.\" She gave him an unconvincing smile. \"Really.\" He stared at her. He wasn't going to leave until she gave him an answer. She sighed. \"I'm fine. It's just…Daddy told me a lot of things today, is all. He gave me a lot to think about.\" Max interpreted this as the following: \"Dad told me a lot of grownup stuff that you can't hear because you're too little.\" Bella seemed to know how he felt. She ruffled his hair and smiled sadly. \"I promise I'll tell you all about it someday. That sound good?\" \"Yes,\" Max conceded, knowing that it was useless to pry anything more out of her. And as he walked away, Max began to wonder what other secrets his family was keeping from him. And – when he was old enough – if he'd ever learn them.[Chapter 9] Hey! Here's another \"filler\" chapter. Sorry if it's boring... ... Chapter Seven: Sick Day \"Bella, I'm sorry. You'll have to stay in bed today.\" Bella opened her mouth to protest, but all that came out was a series of coughs. She had been up half the night with a runny nose and a sore throat, and now she had a bad cough, to top it all off. \"But, Mom…\" Bella said when coughing subsided. \"It's the weekend…*cough, cough*. I wanted to…*cough, cough, cough*…go out and play in the…*cough*…snow.\" \"I'm sorry, sweetheart. You're sneezing, you have a sore throat, and you're coughing up a lung.\" She thrust a thermometer under Bella's tongue and looked at it a minute later. \"You're also burning up.\" \"But…\" Bella started, trying to sit up. \"No buts,\" Connie said firmly, walking out the door. \"You can move to my bed for today, but I don't want you getting up too much.\" Bella glumly got out of bed and followed Connie to her room. This was usually where the kids went if they were sick because they could have the luxury of lying in bed all day while still being able to watch TV. \"I'm going to call in sick,\" Connie said, reaching for the cordless phone. \"You can't be home by yourself in the state you're in.\" She walked out of the room, dialing the number of her work. Bella reached for the TV remote and turned on SpongeBob. Every time she tried to laugh, all that came out was excessive coughing. A soft knock came from outside the room. \"Bella?\" came Max's voice. Bella tried to tell Max to go away, but she once again began to cough. Max opened the door and walked in. \"What's wrong? Are you sick?\" Bella nodded and emitted a sneeze. \"Do you need a Kleenex?\" Bella nodded again, trying not to stare at her hands, which were now covered in green. Max went out of the room and came back with a Kleenex box. \"Here, Bella,\" he said, handing it to her. \"Thanks,\" Bella said quickly, afraid that she'd start coughing if she tried to talk anymore. \"Bella? Is it okay if I stay here with you?\" Max asked, toeing the carpet. Bella shook her head. \"I'm sick,\" Bella said, restraining herself from coughing. \"I can take care of you,\" Max said, looking up at her with his big, brown eyes. \"I can ask Mommy to help me make you some soup.\" Bella was about to tell him that she'd think about it when Connie suddenly reappeared. \"Max, you can't be in here today,\" she said, herding him out. \"Bella's sick, and we don't want you getting sick, either.\" \"But—\" \"No buts,\" Connie said firmly. \"Today this room is off-limits, okay?\" \"Okay,\" Max conceded. He turned and waved sadly. \"Bye, Bella.\" Bella caught a sneeze in a Kleenex before waving back. Connie shut the door behind Max and then turned to her daughter. \"What's gotten into you two?\" Bella was confused. \"Huh?\" \"You two have been getting along fine for the past two months,\" Connie said, folding her arms. \"You've only had about...what, five minor disagreements at the most? This is the first time since…Max was born that you've been nice to each other.\" Bella shrugged. \"I don't know,\" she said, once again restraining a cough. \"Maybe you were right about it being a phase. Maybe I've grown out of it.\" \"Bella, it's not good to do that,\" Connie remarked. \"Go ahead and cough.\" Bella nodded and let herself cough, and what started out as one or two turned into a coughing spasm. When she was done, her chest hurt. \"I'm gonna try to find some medicine,\" Connie said more to herself than Bella. She walked out of the room and closed the door. ... The day was very uneventful after that. Bella slept for a few hours and watched TV the rest of the time. Her meals were brought to her on a cookie tray, and all she drank was water. She would look out the window now and then, jealous of the kids who got to go out and play (although she was happy that there wasn't any snow just yet). In the middle of the afternoon, Bella heard someone at the door. She thought it was Connie at first, but she quickly realized it wasn't when she heard the light pattering of feet on the hallway floor. She got up and saw that the door was still closed, but someone had slipped a piece of paper under the door. Bella got up to retrieve it before settling back into bed. She felt a smile spread across her face when she read what was on the paper: Dear Bella, Please get well soon. I miss you. Love, Max Under the note was a stick figure drawing of Max and Bella, fighting off a dragon. Max was portrayed as a wolf in a superhero outfit, wielding a sword, while it looked as if Bella had fangs protruding from her mouth and was karate-kicking the dragon. Next to the two stick figures were the words Max the Super Wolf and Bella the Vampire . Even though she still didn't feel one hundred percent healthy, Bella sensed that she was now feeling a little better. She'd have to thank Max later for curing her loneliness. ... A week after getting over her cold-flu-whatever-it-was, Bella started to have an itch. It came in red bumpy patches; it would start one place, and then it would jump to another part of her body. All day at school, Bella felt itchy, and found herself scratching excessively. \"Bella,\" Tori said at lunch, \"your neck is all red and spotty.\" \"I know,\" Bella said, flinching from the pain of scratching. \"And so are my arms and my legs and everywhere else.\" \"You should go see the nurse. You might have chicken pox.\" \"I already had that when I was five. Besides, it keeps moving.\" \"Huh?\" Tori cocked her head, confused. \"Like, my arms will itch, then it'll stop, then my feet will itch, then it'll stop, and—\" \"Okay, I get it,\" Tori said. \"I don't care what it is. You need to see the nurse.\" ... It turned out that she had hives. Both the school nurse and the doctor she was taken to said that it was most likely and after effect from whatever she had had the previous week. Bella was told that she needed to keep the rash from worsening by keeping cool and taking Benadryl, along with staying away from wool and polyester until she got better. Although the hives only lasted a few days, Bella was miserable the whole time. She quickly learned that hives could be very unpredictable, and often found herself rubbing the bottoms of her feet on the carpet or clawing at her elbows. She knew that scratching only made it worse, but it was much too hard to simply let the Benadryl take effect, especially since it only lasted for four hours. The day after she was feeling better, Bella found another drawing lying on her bed. This one read: Dear Bella, I'm glad you're feeling better. I really missed you. Maybe tomorrow you and I can play together. Max Accompanying this note was a picture of Max the Super Wolf, fighting off red spots that looked an awful lot like her hives. In the background was Bella the Vampire, smiling and covered with various Band-Aids, indicating that she was all better. Bella smiled. Her mother had a rule that if anyone in the house was sick, they needed to wait at least three days before getting back to their normal schedule. But this time, she was determined to break the rules. Max wanted - needed - a playmate, and she was determined to fill that spot. Her mother would understand…eventually.[Chapter 10] Hola! Again, I'm really sorry about not updating sooner! School and extra-cirriculars are taking over my brain...LOL not really, but I'm super busy this weekend, so I'm guessing this is the only post I'll be able to do. But, I have days off for Thanksgiving in a couple weeks, so that means more posting! WHOO! Oh, and here's a little anecdote about the mood for this chapter: I was watching some Where The Wild Things Are behind-the-scenes stuff this morning on YouTube, and there was a video about all the kids they had on the movie set. They were all sooooo cute, running around and doing goofy things! So it motivated me to make this chapter very uplifting. Enjoy! ... Chapter Eight: A Day With Max Carson Munch-munch-munch. Claire looked up from her homework and gave a warning look. Munch-munch-munch. Claire simply ignored her. Munch-munch-munch. Claire slammed the book shut. \"Could you please go do that somewhere else?\" Bella shoved more animal crackers into her mouth. \"Mom always says that I can't leave the table unless I've finished my food.\" She made certain that the tiny bits stuck inside her mouth were visible. Claire rolled her eyes. \"Please tell me you have something better to do today.\" \"Hmm, let's see…\" Bella tapped her chin, making it look like she was considering her options and actually caring that she was bothering her sister. After a few seconds, she stopped. \"No.\" She began to munch loudly on a lion and a rhinoceros. \"Now I know you're feeling better,\" Claire muttered as she gathered her things and moved into the living room. \"You have the energy to annoy me to my wit's end.\" Bella watched her walk away. \"Love you, too, Claire,\" she said snidely. \"Bella!\" Max came running down the stairs. \"Look! Look what I made!\" He proudly beamed as he held out a structure made of Legos. \"Wow, Max, that's really cool,\" Bella said, really meaning it. She wasn't skilled when it came to making things. She always needed help with arts and crafts at Girl Scout Camp, whether it be beading or widdeling or even rope tying. \"It's a boat, see?\" Max pointed to his construction. \"It's really strong and can get through anything!\" \"That's really neat,\" Bella said. \"You've really got a knack for building things, don't you?\" \"Uh-huh.\" Max nodded his head up and down excitedly. \"You wanna do something today, since I'm feeling better?\" \"Yeah!\" Max was practically bouncing off the walls. \"Let's go play!\" He grabbed her arm and dragged her towards the door. \"Okay, okay!\" Bella was gasping for breath from trying to keep up with him. \"Slow down, buddy!\" \"We're going out to pla-ay! We're going out to pla-ay!\" Max sang, retrieving his tennis shoes. Claire looked at them from the living room. \"Oh, good. You're going outside. Don't be afraid to stay out there long. I'm gonna need some peace and quiet – for once.\" Bella walked out the door, shaking her head. Claire, being the snake in the grass that she was, took advantage of Bella and Max's newfound friendship. She continued to go off with her own friends and find excuses why she couldn't play with them, only spending time with the two of them once a week now. \"What are we gonna do, Bella?\" Max asked, still bouncing up and down. \"You wanna go to the park?\" A few blocks away, there was a park, complete with a playground and jungle gym. \"Sure. Let's go. But you have to hold my hand when we cross the street.\" \"Fine.\" Max grabbed her hand impatiently. \"Let's just go !\" When they arrived at the park, no one else was there. There hadn't been any snow yet, but it was still a bit cold outside. Max immediately ran to the playground and went down the biggest slide a few times. Bella couldn't help but start laughing. \"Geez, Max, where'd all this pent-up energy come from?\" Max didn't answer her question. \"Come on, Bella! Go down the slide!\" She climbed the ladder and went down the metal slide. Although it was the biggest slide on the playground, it was also the slowest, and wasn't very fun. \"Whee…\" she said, trying to sound enthused. \"That was pathetic!\" Max exclaimed, surprising Bella with the last word. \"You gotta do it like this!\" He climbed up the ladder and went down again. \"WHEE!\" he cried. He landed on his feet and looked at her. \"Now you try it.\" \"Max…\" He pointed to the slide. \"Do it.\" This time, Bella made sure she sounded excited. \"WHEE!\" she said, mentally cringing at how stupid she must have look. \"That's more like it!\" Max said, now hanging from the monkey bars. \"Look, Bella! I'm a monkey!\" He hung by one arm and waved. \"Max, you gotta be careful on those things!\" Bella said, but couldn't help but giggle. \"Whoo!\" Max swung back and forth, finally climbing on top of the bars. \"I'm King of the Playground!\" he declared. Bella was laughing now – her loud, unladylike laugh that could upset birds nesting in the trees. \"What's so funny?\" Max demanded. \"Nothing,\" Bella said. \"It's just…I didn't think you could be so…lively!\" Max looked thoughtful for a moment. \"Your turn!\" he said, climbing down from the monkey bars. \"My turn for what?\" \"Well, I showed you how to slide down a slide. Now you have to show me how to do something.\" Bella sighed. \"Max, you know I'm not good at that kind of thing.\" \"Show me!\" Max stamped his foot and folded his arms. \"Remember, I'm King of the Playground, and if I want something, I get it. Or I'll have to put you in jail!\" He pointed to an alcove just under one of the smaller slides. Being put in jail wasn't the worst thing that could happen, but Bella knew that Max would have her stay there for a while, and just sitting under a slide wasn't all that fun. She racked her brain for something – anything – that would impress Max – and maybe calm him down a little. \"I got it,\" she said. \"Follow me.\" She led him around the playground first, just to keep him entertained. The idea she had was a bit boring, but it was all she could think of. She finally led him to the tallest point of the playground. \"Okay, Max. You ready?\" Max nodded. \"First, close your eyes.\" Max did so, but quickly opened one of them. \"No peeking.\" Max sighed, but did as he was told. \"Good. Now, give me your hand.\" \"You're not gonna push me off this thing, are you?\" Max asked. Bella was shocked. \"No. Why would I do that? Just give me your hand. I promise I won't let you fall.\" Max seemed a bit reluctant, but let her guide him to the edge of the tower. She noticed that the wind was gently blowing, which made doing this even better. \"Okay. Now spread out your arms.\" He tentatively did. \"Now open your eyes.\" As he did, he began to look around. Bella was afraid that he wouldn't get what she was trying to show him, but what he said next changed all that: \"I'm flying, Bella!\" \"Yeah, it feels like that, doesn't it?\" \"No,\" he said in his commanding King voice. \"I'm really flying.\" \"Yeah,\" she said. \"You are.\" ... \"Where'd you learn to do that?\" Max asked, later that day. \"Mom,\" Bella said, knowing that her answer was partly true. \"It was really cool,\" Max said. \"It's even cooler in my tree house,\" Bella remarked. \"You…you wouldn't wanna go up and try it, would you?\" She loved seeing Max's face light up like a Christmas tree. She knew Max had wanted to go up in her tree house for the longest time, and after today, she knew that he was ready. When they got up there, Max was in awe. \"Wow,\" he said, looking around. \"This is…wow!\" \"I knew you'd like it.\" He stood on the deck and looked out over the neighborhood, spreading out his arms airplane-style. \"You're right,\" he said. \"It is better up here.\" Bella smiled, and after a minute, spread out her arms and flew away with Max.[Chapter 11] Hi! Sorry it's been so long! I have school...and homework. Plus last night I finally got some of my guy friends to watch Twilight ...and they think it's a decent movie. Anyway, this is a filler chapter (and the next couple will be, too...sorry), and I know it's not even Thanksgiving yet, but what the heck? They already have some Christmas music on the radio station...so why not? Enjoy! ... Chapter Nine: Spirit of the Season \"Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the waaaayyy!\" Max half-sang, half shouted. \"Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleeeiiiggghhh!\" The song ended, and Max clapped his hands. \"That was fun! Let's do it again!\" \"Let's not and say we did,\" Claire said from the front seat, clearly disgusted. \"Mom, can we please change the station? You know how I feel about Christmas music.\" While Connie explained to Claire how it was tradition to listen to Christmas music at Christmastime, Bella stared out the window of the car. Everywhere she looked there was snow – blankets of snow, all lying on the ground and on the roofs of the buildings and on the streetlights. There was only two weeks left until Christmas Eve, and this year, they'd been lucky to have snow before that day rolled around. Soft piano music filled the car's speakers. \"Oh, I love this song!\" Connie turned the volume up. \"This isn't that shoe song, is it?\" Claire grimaced. \"So what if it is?\" Connie asked. \"It's such a good song…it makes me want to cry every time I hear it.\" \"It makes me want to barf,\" Claire muttered. \"Well, it's my car, and we're listening to it.\" Connie gave her a playful smile. \"When you're old enough to drive, you can listen to what you want in your car.\" \"I don't like this song,\" Max piped up from the backseat. \"It's boring. I want Jingle Bells!\" \"They won't play that for a few more hours,\" Claire informed him. \"Until then, we have to put up with this .\" She gestured with her hands to the speakers. A man's husky voice was now coming out of them. \"This guy can't sing!\" Max exclaimed. \"I want Jingle Bells!\" \"Stop complaining, you two!\" The radio switched off, and the car stopped. \"We're here.\" ... It was known throughout Bella's family that Connie always did her shopping at the last minute. Not that Bella minded; she loved the feeling she got when she saw all the Christmas trees and paper snowflakes in the store windows. It also gave her and her siblings a chance to sneak a peek at their presents – if they were quiet enough and Connie didn't catch them. Looking in the girl section at Toys R Us, she saw this year's Holiday Barbie. She hoped to herself that her grandparents didn't get her one this year. It wasn't that she was against Barbie or anything, like her mother; or that she was too old for dolls, like Claire. She just wasn't sure what to do with stuff like that anymore. Special edition dolls were \"collectibles\", meant to gather dust in a box or on a shelf until their owner got older and sensible enough to put them on eBay. \"Bella!\" Max called. \"Bella, come look at this!\" She found him in the Lego aisle. He was excitedly pointing to a huge box with a spaceship on the front. \"Look! That's an actual spaceship!\" he said. \"It's huge!\" \"Sure is,\" Bella said, mildly impressed. \"You think Mommy's gonna get it for me?\" \"I don't know, Max,\" Bella said, knowing that they were standing in front of one of Max's presents. \"Mom keeps that kind of thing to herself. It's hard to say.\" \"You know, don't you?\" Max looked at her in mock annoyance. \"You know what I'm getting!\" \"Maybe I do, maybe I don't.\" Max shoved her playfully. \"No fair!\" \"If I told you what I knew, it wouldn't be all that fun when you open your presents, now would it?\" Max considered this. \"Fine.\" The music over the intercom changed to a cheery, upbeat tune. Max's eyes lit up. \"Jingle Bells!\" he said happily, skipping off. Bella shook her head, laughing and trying to keep up with him. ... \"Presents! Presents! Presents!\" Max sat eagerly by the tree, eyeing all the brightly wrapped boxes. \"Hang on, Max,\" Connie said, holding a video camera. \"I want to film everyone opening their presents.\" \"Mom!\" Bella covered her face with her pajama sleeves. \"That's lame! Who does that anymore?\" \"Bella, if you can't say anything nice, keep your mouth shut.\" She looked toward the stairs. \"Claire! Come on! It's Christmas! You can't sleep all day, honey!\" Claire came down the stairs in a sulk, clearly not happy to have been woken up at seven in the morning. \"Can we hurry this up? I'd like to go back to sleep.\" \"Hang on a second,\" came their dad's voice from the kitchen. He'd decided to spend Christmas with them this year, despite the fact that he and Connie weren't living together for the time being. But Bella and Max were happy to notice that the two of them were tolerating each other and hadn't had a fight for a while. \"Okay.\" Connie hit the record button. \"Go see what Santa brought you!\" Max tore into his presents in a frenzy. \"Which one should I open first?\" \"Open the ones from Santa, sweetie,\" Connie said. \"No, not all at once!\" Max got some toys and games (and the Lego spaceship), which he opened immediately, ignoring Connie's pleas not to. Claire got some CDs and a pair of nicely made headphones, which she immediately ran up to her room, so Max wouldn't get too crazy and break them. Compared to Max's excitement level, Bella's wasn't nearly as high. She was grateful for her presents from Santa – a set of Harry Potter books, a Madame Alexander doll, a Cranium board game, the Finding Nemo movie – but try as she might, she just couldn't match Max's happiness. \"Time to open Grandma and Grandpa's presents,\" Connie announced. Max got more toys and stuffed animals, and Bella and Claire got some clothes. Bella also received a journal, and Claire got some jewelry and stationary. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" she asked, holding up a pack of paper. \"Who uses stationary anymore?\" \"Claire,\" their dad said, sipping his coffee and opening one of his own presents. \"Your grandparents were nice enough to go out and get you something. I'm not saying you have to use it—\" \"Of course she's using it,\" Connie cut in. \"To write her thank-yous. Right, Claire?\" \"Fine.\" Claire tossed the pack aside. \"Bella, I think I see something else from Grandma and Grandpa under there,\" Connie said. Bella reached for a square-looking package. The gift tag read To Bella. Merry Christmas! Love ya, Grandma and Grandpa. She tore the wrapping from the box. It revealed a blonde figure in a green velvet dress, surrounded by snowflakes and a gold background. \"Gee,\" Bella said, trying to maintain her disappointment. \"It's a…it's a…\" \"It's a Holiday Barbie!\" Connie said, also trying to sound happy. \"Aw, look! She's so…festive. We'll have to make sure that you send a very nice thank-you to Grandma and Grandpa for that.\" Their parents got them similar gifts, along with an extra-special present. Claire's was a digital camera (which she also ran upstairs to her room), and Bella was surprised to receive an American Girl doll. But compared to his bounciness earlier, Max was at an all-new level when he opened his present. \"A WOLF SUIT!\" he exclaimed. Connie glanced at their dad, and Bella could tell that this hadn't been what her mother had wanted to give Max. \"I wanna put it on!\" Max tried to fit into the suit, but it was much too big for him. \"I'll get some pins and tape,\" Connie said, handing the video camera to her husband. \"I figured that he'd grow into it,\" he said, holding up his hands in defense. \"I didn't think it'd be this big on him.\" \"Look, Bella,\" Max said. \"I'm a wolf.\" He growled, showing his teeth. Bella giggled. \"You're one scary-looking wolf. I wouldn't wanna mess with you.\" Satisfied with her answer, Max smiled. He hugged her. \"Merry Christmas, Bella.\" She ruffled his ears, realizing that this Christmas hadn't been as bad as she'd initially thought. \"Merry Christmas, Max.\"[Chapter 12] Hey! Sorry about not updating sooner! School's trying to kill me...and so are my teachers (jk, jk...). Anyway, this chapter's a bit more on the angsty side, and I apologize if you guys don't like it. P.S. Obviously, the classroom scene was based off of the one in the movie, and I got the idea for the dialogue from my copy of The Wild Things by Dave Eggers. I don't own either one. Enjoy, and Happy Thanksgiving! ... Chapter Ten: A Not So Good Day Max refused to take off his wolf suit for the rest of Christmas vacation. \"I'm a wolf! Wolfs need fur!\" he'd insist when Connie would try to convince him to take it off. She eventually gave up the battle and let him wear it, but finally got him to leave it at home as soon as they went back to school. Bella hated school. It was just another place where she didn't quite fit in. Most of the kids in her grade thought she was weird; the only friend she really had was Tori, who was in the other class. \"The sun,\" Mrs. Wertben explained, \"is the center of our solar system.\" No response came from the students. They were doodling in their notebooks or flicking pen caps at each other or sleeping. Bella was trying to read a book under her desk. \"This is so lame,\" said Gerry Anne from beside her. \"I want to go home and sleep.\" Usually, Bella disagreed with Gerry Anne. She wasn't someone Bella tried to be nice to, and vice versa. But today, Bella found she was thinking the same thing. \"The sun is the highest source of energy,\" Mrs. Wertben said. \"However, what few people realize is that, like everything on earth, the sun isn't immortal. Like everything else, it will eventually die.\" Bella dropped her book, her eyes shooting to the white board. \"What will happen is the sun will first expand, like this.\" Mrs. Wertben turned to the drawing she'd done on the white board, gesturing to it. \"Then it will envelop the planets – including Earth. Like I said before, the sun is the highest source of energy, but that energy will eventually run out.\" She looked up at the florescent lights. \"Can someone tell me what happens when a light bulb runs out of energy?\" The class gave her blank looks. They thought that her question seemed to be the dumbest thing ever. The teacher, in reality, had the rapt attention of only one of her students, whose hand rose slowly in the air. \"Yes, Isabella?\" \"It…burns out?\" \"Correct. And that's precisely what will happen to the sun's light, and when that light goes out, the solar system will go dark…permanently.\" Permanently? That word bounced across her mind, unable to sink in. Bella refused to believe that the sun was going to die. She half-expected some camera people to jump out at any second, and then Ashton Kutcher would tell the class that they were on TV and had just been \"punk'd\". \"Of course,\" Mrs. Wertben continued, oblivious to her unresponsive class, \"that won't happen for another four or six billion years! By then, the human race will be gone, extinct from either war, global warming, natural disasters, disease, the vile takeover of technology…\" And this is supposed to make me feel better about the end of the world? Bella was sure that she'd start crying any second now. Mrs. Wertben looked at the children and smiled. \"Wow, don't I sound like a real ray of sunshine! But let me assure you all that by the time the sun goes out, we'll all be dead and gone. In fact, the human race will most likely be forgotten by then…and all of our accomplishments, also.\" The bell rang, and the students bolted out of the room. \"I really wish I'd stayed in bed today,\" Gerry Anne said. ... Bella sat quietly in her seat, looking out the bus window. The sun shone brightly in the sky, showing no telltale signs that it would one day perish. \"Hey, Carson!\" a boy across the aisle called. Bella turned her indifferent expression to Randy Hazrow, a boy in her grade. He terrorized her daily on the bus, whether it was with threats or his dirty jokes. She usually had a witty comeback or retort to say to him, but after class today, she didn't have the energy. \"What, Randy?\" \"Aw, did I upset you?\" Randy pouted and made puppy dog eyes. \"Does the poor baby want her momma?\" Bella turned back to the window. \"Hey, Carson! If you don't answer me, I'm gonna knock all your teeth out.\" \"I'd like to see you try that, blockhead,\" Bella muttered. Randy looked at her. \"What did you say?\" Bella tensed up. \"Nothing.\" \"You called me a bad word, didn't you?\" \"No, I didn't.\" A smile crossed Randy's face. \"I'm gonna tell the bus driver!\" Bella groaned inwardly as Randy stood up from his seat. \"BUS DRIVER!\" he called. \"BELLA SAID *$#^!\" \"So did you, loser!\" an older kid called from the back. \"Shut up!\" \"BUS DRIVER!\" Randy said again. \"BELLA CALLED ME A *$#^!\" The bus driver, a middle-age woman with dyed-red hair and black Crocks, pulled her intercom device from the wall. \"Sit down, Mr. Hazrow,\" she commanded. \"But Bella's swearing back here! She called me a—\" \"We are all aware of what happened, Mr. Hazrow. Please take your seat, or I'll pull the bus over.\" \"I didn't say anything! He's lying!\" Bella wasn't going to put up with this. \"She's bullying me! Someone help!\" \"STOP IT!\" She took her lunchbox and smacked him over the head. He fell on his seat, shielding himself from another blow. \"Knock it off back there!\" the bus driver was angry now. She shifted her gaze – concealed by sunglasses – to Bella. \"Miss Carson, I'll be speaking with you when we arrive at your stop.\" Randy gave her a grin. \"Ooh, your in trouble.\" \"Thanks a lot, Randy,\" Bella said, leaning her head against the window. \"Any time, Carson,\" he said. \"Anytime.\" ... The moving blur of houses began to become clearer, finally revealing her home. Bella got up from her seat and walked down the aisle. It seemed as if the front of the bus was moving further away with ever step she took. \"You didn't say anything to Mr. Hazrow, did you?\" the bus driver asked in her sharp voice. Bella nodded, staring at her feet. \"That's what I thought. But it wasn't smart to smack him on the head like you did. I'm gonna have to separate you two from now on. And if anything happens like this again, both of you will be suspended from the bus. Remember: riding the bus is a privilege…\" \"…not a right,\" Bella finished. \"Exactly.\" The bus doors open. \"Have a nice day.\" Bella got off the bus and practically ran into the house, slamming the door behind her. \"Hi, honey,\" Connie said. \"How was school?\" \"Oh, you know…\" Bella said. \"It was okay.\" ... Bella was very quiet for the rest of the night. No one questioned her about it, and she liked it that way. But she knew that, sooner or later, at least one member of her family would ask her; the tolerance level for secrets in that house was almost zero. Sure enough, while she was staring out the window, a knock came at her bedroom door. \"Come in,\" she called. The door opened and Max came in. \"Hi, Bella.\" \"Hey, Max.\" She made room for him on the window seat. \"What's up?\" \"You didn't have a good day at school, did you?\" Bella tried to act like this shocked her. \"What makes you say that?\" \"You were happy when we left this morning, and now you're sad.\" Max's face was filled with genuine concern. \"I don't like it when you're sad. It makes me sad.\" \"Max, I'm not sad.\" She tried to smile. \"School today just wasn't as great as it could have been, is all.\" \"Are you gonna be okay?\" \"I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.\" Max looked at the floor and held out a piece of paper. \"I made you this. I hope you feel better.\" It was one of Max's signature drawings. Instead of being Max the Super Wolf, he was King Max, and he held a glowing sword. He was fighting off a school bus – or, at least, it looked like a school bus, only it looked more like a big, yellow dragon. Looking out one of the windows was Bella the Vampire, crying for help. \"This is so nice,\" Bella said. \"Thank you.\" \"Don't worry about Bella,\" Max said, pointing to the picture. \"King Max is able to get her out of the evil dragon.\" \"That's very reassuring,\" Bella said, looking out the window at the starry sky. \"Bella?\" \"Yeah, Max?\" \"We're…we're not gonna die in a few years…are we?\" \"No.\" She furrowed her brow, contemplating this. \"Why?\" \"A few kids at my school said that there's gonna be a date called 666, and we're all gonna die.\" His brown eyes widened with worry. \"It's not gonna happen, is it?\" \"It won't happen then, Max. They're just trying to scare everybody.\" \"But…will it happen eventually?\" Bella wished he wouldn't have asked her this. She didn't want to talk about it, or think about how the sun was going to die. \"I don't know, Max.\" She took him in her arms. \"I really don't know.\" He didn't question her further, and they sat in the peaceful silence, both hoping for a miracle, a long life, and for the next day to come.[Chapter 13] This one's kind of a bit depressing, but I couldn't think of much else. Sorry if it's not that good. ... Chapter Eleven: A Very Unfortunate Event The girls' high-pitched laughter filled the house. It reached Bella's ears, reminding her that she would do anything to join in their fun. Today was March 25th – Claire's thirteenth birthday. Now that she was a teenager, she was much too mature to have Bella hanging around. So this year for her birthday party, Claire had decided to invite all her friends – and disinvite her sister. \"Who needs them?\" Bella said out loud. \"I can have my own fun.\" She sat on her bedroom floor, looking around the room for something to do. What's the point? I've already done everything there is to do in here. She stared at the ceiling, trying to think. After a few minutes of just staring at the bland white stucco, she finally gave up. Her door opened suddenly. \"Hi, sweetie,\" Connie said. Bella wasn't about to let her mother in on her boredom. She put on a fake smile. \"Hi, Mom. How's the party going?\" \"Fine.\" She stood in the doorframe, looking lovingly at Bella. \"I just wanted to see how things were going in here.\" \"I'm a-okay.\" Bella widened her already-phony grin. \"Nothing out of the ordinary going on in here.\" Connie sighed. \"You've been sulking in here this whole time, haven't you?\" Bella slumped her shoulders, knowing that it would be useless to lie to her mother. \"This isn't fair. I've been to all of her other birthday parties. Why is this one different?\" \"She's growing up.\" Connie gave her daughter a sympathetic look. \"I wish I could do something, Bella, I really do.\" Bella didn't know what to think anymore. She knew her mother had the authority to force Claire to allow her to come to the party. But she also knew that Connie didn't want to get involved in something as petty as that, so she allowed Claire to do whatever. \"Do you want me to bring you a piece of cake?\" Connie asked. \"It's ice cream cake. I know it's your favorite.\" Bella shook her head. \"I'm not hungry.\" Connie walked in and sat herself next to Bella. \"Sweetie,\" she said. \"I know you're upset. And I'm sorry that there's nothing I can do about that.\" Bella looked at Connie. \"I just wish there was something fun I could do.\" Connie looked thoughtful. \"Hmm. That phrase sounds familiar.\" \"Familiar? How?\" \"Oh…maybe it's because that's exactly what a four-year-old boy just said to me five minutes ago.\" Bella felt a pang of guilt. \"He…he did?\" \"Mmm-hmm. He's been in his room all day, depressed that his older sister hasn't bothered to play with him.\" Bella looked away. The thought had never occurred to her to go and spend time with Max. She'd been too busy grousing about Claire that she'd completely forgotten about him. \"You know,\" Connie said. \"I'm sure that if you apologize enough, he might come around.\" Bella gave a sad smile. \"I guess it doesn't hurt to try.\" ... Max lay upside-down on his bed, feeling all the blood rush from his body to his brain. He was a bat – a vicious, bloodthirsty vampire bat. He slept during the daylight hours, and only came out at night to hunt his prey. He felt his vision start to go blurry around the edges. Hanging upside-down like this made him dizzy, but at least he was doing something. It took his mind off of his sisters – and what they'd done to him. Max still couldn't believe that Claire had failed to invite him to her birthday party. He'd gone to the one the year before; all of her friends fussed over him and thought he was the cutest thing they'd ever seen. He was quickly annoyed with this after a few minutes, but at least he'd gotten some cake. This year, though, Claire had made a specific demand that he and Bella were banned from coming downstairs until after the party was over. Max was somewhat put out about this, but it was more because of the fact that he wouldn't get any cake than not attending the actual party itself. Max's anger quickly shifted to Bella. She was more upset than he was about missing the party. He didn't mind that she was, because he figured that since they both were stuck up here for the day, they might as well make the most of it and do something fun. But she hadn't come in once today; she was in her own room, most likely pouting. It confused him that she'd forget he existed so easily. They were each other's best friend, and did almost everything together. Yet today marked an event that rocked Max's way of thinking so hard, he wasn't sure if he'd ever view his sister the same way again. I don't need Bella and her stupid girl brain, he told himself as his head pulsed with blood. I'm a bat. Bats are loners, always on alert. And if she comes in here, I can suck her blood, and she'll be sorry she ignored me. As he was thinking this, the door to his room slowly creaked open. He saw Bella's head peek in. \"Max? It's me.\" He glared at her – or, tried to glare at her. It was difficult when there was so much blood pressing against his face. \"Go away,\" he said. \"I'm a bat, and I'm provoked easily.\" \"I just came in to see if you wanted to go down to the park.\" She sounded hopeful and apologetic. He guessed that Connie had just had a talk with her. \"Too bad. Like I said, I'm a bat. I sleep during the day.\" He awkwardly folded his arms over his face, pretending they were his wings. \"We can play bats at the park, Max. It'll be fun.\" \"If you keep bugging me, I'll suck your blood,\" he threatened. \"I'll eat you for dinner.\" \"Max.\" Her tone was hard, but her eyes revealed that she was miserable. \"I'm sorry I didn't come in here sooner. I was too caught up in thinking about Claire.\" He looked at her through his \"wings\", but quickly looked away. \"I don't care if you're sorry. I'm mad at you.\" \"I know you are. I don't blame you for being mad at me.\" She took a step toward him. \"Just know that I'm really sorry, Max. I don't wanna fight.\" Max quickly went through the pros and cons of staying mad at Bella. On the plus side, he would be alone in his room for the rest of the day. He liked the idea of being by himself; it gave him time to think. But he didn't want to pass up a chance to go down to the park. Connie wouldn't let him go by himself yet since he was only four. And he didn't want to be mad at Bella, he really didn't. Now that Claire was getting older and seemed to think she was Miss Independent, Bella was the only one who would play with him. Like he'd established before, she was his best friend. \"You…you really mean it when you're sorry?\" Bella nodded. \"Of course.\" Max slowly brought his arms from his head and let them hang limp. He heaved himself upright, feeling the blood drain from his head back to his body. The light-headed feeling vanished. \"I'll play with you,\" he decided. \"On one condition.\" \"And what's that?\" \"You have to do whatever I say,\" Max said. \"You need to prove yourself worthy.\" Bella giggled, seeming to see through his anger. \"Alright. You wanna head down to the park now?\" Max nodded, sliding off the bed. ... \"Okay, Mr. Bat,\" Bella said, curtseying. \"What must I do first?\" \"I'm not a bat anymore,\" Max said in his kingly voice. \"I'm King of the Playground. And I hereby order you to go across the monkey bars.\" \"No sweat,\" Bella said. \"On your feet.\" Bella gulped. \"You mean…climb on top and walk across?\" Max nodded. \"But…that looks really dangerous.\" \"Who's the King of the Playground?\" Max questioned. Bella sighed. \"You are.\" Max nodded again. \"Go on.\" Bella nervously walked to the monkey bars. She climbed the ladder and hoisted herself on top. She shakily stood up. Max watched her the whole time. It's okay, Bella…it's not so bad up here. Just walk across and— Her foot slipped, and she momentarily lost her balance. \"You okay?\" Max called. He seemed worried now. \"I'm good,\" Bella assured him. She was careful to take slow steps, for fear she'd fall and fracture something. She went along like this, aware that she could fall again. It made her incredibly scared. Now, you may think that Bella was scared to be up on the monkey bars because she was afraid of heights. She was actually very indifferent to being up high; it didn't bother her. Her real fear was the clumsiness she had inherited from her father. She was notorious for being unable to keep her balance, and that was why Max, knowing this, had challenged her to do this task. Don't fall…don't fall…don't— It happened again. Only this time, she teetered sideways. She heard Max take in a sharp breath. Her arms flailed as she tried to maintain her balance. Then that awful feeling in the pit of her stomach came. She knew she was falling towards the ground. She needed to be quick; grab onto something. Anything. Her hand found a monkey bar, and she curled her fingers around it. She hung there, watching her feet dangling just inches above the ground. She saw Max's eyes grow to the size of flying saucers. She tried clambered back up to the top, determined to finish her job. But her hands slipped again, and down, down, down she fell. She hit the mulch, hearing the sickening pop of something underneath her. Bella fought not to scream. Her leg was suddenly shooting with pain, but she couldn't scare Max. She couldn't scare herself. Max ran to her. \"Bella! Are you okay?\" She winced slightly. \"I'm fine, Max.\" She tried to stand up, but collapsed back on the ground. \"You hurt your leg!\" Max's eyes were filled with tears. \"This is all my fault! I'm sorry! You could've DIED!\" \"But I didn't,\" she said. \"I'm fine, Max.\" She got up, but had to use the monkey bars for support. \"We've gotta get home,\" Max said. \"We gotta tell Mommy.\" She nodded, fighting the tears she knew would come soon. \"Yeah…let's go.\" \"You can't walk by yourself.\" He put one of her arms over his shoulders. \"Come on. You can lean on me.\" Bella was too bewildered to argue. She leaned lightly on Max, and together they gradually made their way back home.[Chapter 14] This chapter is dedicated to Nausicaa of the Spirits for the idea that inspired Bella's dream. Thanx! IMPORTANT NOTE: Keep said dream in mind, it may pop up later...*wink, wink* ... Chapter Twelve: To The Hospital Connie was, of course, experiencing two thousand different emotions at once. \"I honestly don't know what I'm going to do with you, Isabella,\" she kept repeating. Each time hurt more than the last, and Bella now felt her chest start to throb. The party, of course, had to be cut short. Connie let Claire's friends use their phone to call their parents, and after phoned the hospital to let them know they were coming in. Claire didn't utter a word the whole time. Bella guessed that her older sister was angry with her for being the indirect cause of her short birthday party. But Claire continued to sit in the living room, looking at the floor as if something interesting was written across the hard wood. Max stayed by her side. He kept trying to explain to Connie that it was his fault Bella had broken her leg, and each time Bella refuted it, saying that she could have refused to do what Max had said. Connie seemed to side with Bella, and kept reassuring Max that he was not to blame for \"any of this mess\". After all of Claire's friends had left, Bella was carried out to their car and laid across the backseat. Max climbed into the very back, careful not to bump her leg. The drive there, although fast, was uncomfortably quiet, everyone following Claire's lead in being silent. ... The hospital wasn't at all busy, but they waited for at least an hour. Connie grumbled about the staff being slow at the worst of times, and then went through all of the parenting magazines that were laid out on the table. Claire was, again, interested in the floor, and Bella could see her blue eyes overflowing with anxiety. Finally, a nurse came to get them. Connie was the only one allowed past the doors with Bella, although Max refused to leave his sister's side. It took a lot of convincing to make him stay put. As Bella was being put into a rickety wheelchair, Claire spoke for the first time since they'd gotten back from the park. \"Make sure you didn't break that leg too bad, now, okay?\" she mumbled, almost incoherently. Bella nodded, trying to give her sister some form of comfort. \"As soon as they're done, I'm coming in there,\" Max insisted. \"You come get me when you're done fixing Bella, okay, Mom?\" \"Don't worry, Max,\" Connie said. \"You can come see her when they're finished. I promise.\" Bella was suddenly being wheeled toward the swinging ER doors. She looked back and gave her siblings a sad smile. Claire looked up and nodded once before looking back down. Max followed them to the doors and then watched as they disappeared down the hall. The doors slowly swung shut, leaving him outside like a lost puppy. ... Bella didn't even try to keep up with what was happening. Her leg felt like it was on fire, and the sooner the doctors fixed it, the better. She learned that an orthopedic had been called to do the surgery, which was why the wait had taken so long. The nurses and doctors kept testing her leg, which did nothing to help ease the pain. They also kept asking Connie how, exactly, she'd broken her leg; Bella thought it was ridiculous that her mother repeat the story over and over again. \"It's so they know I didn't abuse you, dear,\" Connie explained. Bella thought this reason was even more ridiculous than the actual asking. After a whirlwind of doctors, nurses, and X-rays, Bella was finally given some medicine to inhale. She slowly felt her eyelids start to droop, and didn't try to fight the sleep she knew was coming on. It would do her good to escape from all the craziness that she now called her life. ... My Weird, Crazy Dream – Part I As told in 1 st Person by Bella Carson I'm in a boat, sailing on the sea. Nothing surrounds me except water. I would have been scared, but since it's a dream, I don't really feel scared. Instead, I feel bored, because there's nothing to do. After sailing for a long time (but in my dream it felt like only four seconds), I see something in the distance. It looks like an island. So I magically steer my boat over there, and after somehow surviving this wickedly harsh storm and keeping the boat and myself from sinking, I dock on the island – but it takes me, like, FOREVER to tie a knot, since I can't do that to save my life. So I eventually give up tying the stupid thing (but the boat stayed there, anyway – hey, it's a dream!). I turn around, and I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go. And it's nighttime, too, so I'm pretty much freaking out. Then I see a fire coming from somewhere inland, and I follow where it leads. What I find is truly amazing. There are seven beasts standing in a clearing, destroying what look like upright bird nests. They all look fearful, yet cuddly at the same time. I find myself feeling the urge to help them in their merriment. I suddenly leap forward, and there I am, standing among them. They stop what they're doing and come forward. They search me over with their eyes and sniff me with their noses. Finally, one speaks. \"She smells like human,\" it says. \"She looks like the King,\" another puts in. \"King?\" I ask. \"What King?\" The circle parts, and in steps a little boy in a dirty wolf suit with a golden crown sitting on his head. Max. \"Oh, good, you're here,\" he says, but he sounds drunk (like everyone does when you're dreaming). \"They were gonna eat me, but now they can eat you instead.\" \"What?\" I stand there as the biggest one picks me up with its claws. I squeeze my eyes shut. I feel myself slide down its throat. I'm surprisingly not afraid. Suddenly, I feel as if I'm underwater. It sounds like I am, at least. I hear bubbles, and I feel like I'm floating. Slowly, I open my eyes. Yes, I'm underwater now. The water is a brilliant blue. I want to stay here, even though I know I will drown if I don't surface soon. I hear a faint voice calling to me. \"Bella, wake up,\" it says. \" How?\" I want to ask. I'm already awake, aren't I? \" Bella, wake up.\" Something touches my arm. I jerk awake. ... Bella blinked. Her vision was blurry, but she couldn't move her arms. After a few dozen blinks, everything came into focus. She was in a hospital room, with her leg propped up and in a plaster covering. Her arms were hooked up to IVs, which explained why she couldn't move them. She still felt sleepy; part of her wanted to go back to sleep, and the other part wanted to stay awake, scared to start dreaming again. \"Bella?\" She turned her head slowly to her left. Sitting in a chair was Max. She felt relief wash over her as she realized that he wasn't in a wolf suit or wearing a crown. \"Hey, Max,\" she said. Her voice sounded miles away. \"Are you feeling better?\" She tried to nod. \"Yeah…\" Max smiled. \"That's good. I thought they'd never get done.\" \"How…how long did it take?\" Max shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he admitted. \"But it took a long time. Mommy made me and Claire go to Daddy's because she wanted us to go to sleep.\" \"So…what time is it?\" Bella asked. \"It's morning,\" Max offered. \"You've been sleeping for a really long time.\" \"Oh.\" Connie came into view. \"Hi, sweetie.\" She kissed Bella on the forehead. \"You just wake up?\" \"Mmm-hmm.\" \"Well, try to get some rest. We'll leave you alone.\" Max looked up at Connie. \"Do I have to?\" \"She needs to sleep, honey. It's been a long night.\" Max looked at the ground, and then at Bella. \"Okay. Bye, Bella. I can come in as soon as you're done sleeping, right?\" Bella nodded. \"Of course.\" This seemed to make him happier, and she saw his smile returning as they left the room. And although she willed herself to keep awake, Bella found herself slipping back to sleep.[Chapter 15] Hola! Agh, I'm countin' down the days til' I'm off for Christmas! Which not only means spending time with my family, eating crab legs and going shopping, it also means I can update! And I'm guessing I'll be getting to the movie part of the story (a.k.a. the part of the story that covers the plot of the movie). P.S. Sorry if this is really angsty...I was kinda angsty today about something... ... Chapter Thirteen: Max's Temper Tantrum Bella was able to go home the next day. Because her leg wasn't too badly broken, she only had to wear a cast for six weeks. She was required to use crutches for support, but Tori had happily offered to help her at school. The cast wasn't exactly fun, but her classmates had all signed it. Everyone held doors open for her and asked her how she was doing. All of a sudden, everyone wanted to be her friend. \"How's your leg?\" Gerry Anne would ask. Bella would give her a funny look and say, \"Well, aside from the pain, it's okay.\" Gerry Anne would laugh. \"Oh, Bells, you're soooo funny! I've always liked that about you.\" Bella would nod and try to walk away quickly, but it was somewhat hard with her crutches. She found it creepy that her practically-arch-enemy was being nice to her. Even Randy was experiencing strange behavior on the bus. \"Did it hurt when you fell on your leg?\" he asked the first day she came back. \"No,\" Bella said with heavy sarcasm. \"It felt so great to feel my leg shooting with agonizing pain.\" \"Did you cry?\" he asked, ignoring what she'd just said. \"Not right away—\" \"Whoa. You're pretty tough, Carson.\" \"Sure…\" She turned away from him, shaking her head. Her popularity faded after six weeks. As soon as her cast came off, everything toned down a bit, eventually going back to normal by the next week. Bella was relieved that Gerry Anne ignored her and Randy was back to cracking his usual dirty jokes. The same happened with Claire. She was willing to help Bella while her leg was in the cast, but as soon as it was gone, so was her benevolent attitude. Unlike her classmates at school, Bella found that she would miss the kind side of her sister. The kindness from her classmates and sister wasn't the only thing that disappeared with her broken leg. She quickly learned that it was also the force that had kept her parents from fighting for the longest time that she could remember. It started up shortly after the cast came off, and Bella found herself in Max's room for the rest of the spring and most of the summer, comforting him and trying to make him stop the flow of tears. ... \"Why won't they stop?\" Max blubbered one night. \"They said they would! They told me they would!\" \"It's okay, Max,\" Bella said. \"They're going to stop…\" \"No, they're not!\" Max got a gleam in his eye, one that was unfamiliar to her and didn't seem to fit his young age. \"Calm down, Max…\" \"AAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!\" He wasn't Max now. She wasn't even sure what to classify him as. She could only sit as he trashed around the room, knocking into things and breaking others. \"You've gotta stop, Max—\" He stomped with a purpose, screaming at the top of his lungs. Angry tears were coming by the dozens, but he was too busy wrecking his room to notice. \"Max!\" He was making too much noise now. He picked up a baseball and hurled it across the room. It barely missed her head and went right to the wall, making a huge bang sound. She was done with words. He wouldn't listen anymore. So she decided to fight fire with fire – sort of. She had him on the ground, but he was thrashing against her. \"LET GO OF ME!\" he cried, trying to wriggle free. Bella only made grunting sounds. She was determined to restrain him from breaking anything else. The door flew open. \"What's going on in here?\" Connie asked. Max went back to screaming. Bella let go, and off he went, thrashing even harder. \"MAX!\" He stopped, turning to Connie. His tears turned into wails, and he scrambled to her. She took him in her arms, where he fell apart. \"Bella, what happened?\" Connie inquired. She was speechless. Everything had been so sudden, she hadn't been able to keep track. \"He just…went crazy.\" Connie looked from her daughter to her son and back again. \"Does this have anything to do with…\" \"What do you think?\" Connie shook her head. \"I'm sorry, you guys. This is all my fault.\" She sniffled, something she rarely did. \"Mom…don't cry.\" Bella knew things were bad when her mother started to cry. \"Mommy, stop,\" Max said, breaking away. \"I don't want you to feel bad.\" She sighed, wiping away tears that hadn't fallen yet. \"Still…this isn't the way to handle things. Daddy and I…we're acting like toddlers.\" You can say that again… Bella thought. \"Did Daddy and I make you do this?\" Connie asked Max. He didn't answer. \"Yes,\" he finally said. \"I was mad because I don't want you to fight anymore.\" He looked up at her. \"I want us to live together again.\" Bella knew where this was headed: more tears, hurt feelings, and everyone staying up until three in the morning. She turned away, not wanting to have Connie and Max see that she herself was starting to cry. ... Nothing happened that night. Their dad left for the night, and Bella and Max were tucked in before ten. As she was saying goodnight to her mother, Bella suddenly remembered something she had wanted to ask her mother for the longest time. \"Mom?\" \"Yes, dear?\" Her mother looked tired and worried. \"It's not about what happened tonight,\" Bella said, and she saw that Connie slackened with relief. \"Oh. Then…what is it about?\" \"Well, back in January, my teacher was talking about the sun. And she said that it's gonna eventually die. Once you and me and everyone else dies. But she put it in a way that was…well…\" \"Not the friendliest?\" Connie offered. \"Yeah.\" \"Well, she's right that it won't die for a very, very long time. So you don't have to worry about that.\" Bella knew that, but still wasn't reassured. \"I know…but…what if the world ends? Or something happens?\" \"Bella,\" Connie said, \"you can't think that way.\" \"It's hard.\" \"I know it gets hard, but what if everyone in the world went around being scared about that type of thing? No one would get anything done, would they?\" Bella had never thought of that. \"No.\" Connie kissed her on the forehead. \"Just think happy thoughts, okay?\" She smiled. \"Love you, Bella.\" \"Love you, Mom.\" \"And…I'll talk to Daddy about…us fighting around you kids. It's not fair to you, and I know we were doing so well…but things happen.\" Well, duh, things happen. \"Just know that we're trying to get through this, okay?\" Bella nodded, too tired to think of much else. ... That night, she dreamt that everything was okay with her family. Her mother and father weren't fighting, Claire was kind to everyone, and Max wasn't wild. And there she was, quiet and shy, not at all like she was in real life. But life was happier. The way she wanted it to be. This was one dream she knew she didn't want to wake up from. ... And when she did the next morning, she found that Max was on her bedroom floor, clutching his teddy bear tightly. Her fear of his temper tantrum slowly ebbed away as she climbed out of bed and sat beside him, watching him sleep until he woke up.[Chapter 16] Hola! Last chapter until we skip ahead a few years to when the movie takes place! (Although I'll have a few \"setting up the scene\" chapters before I actually get to the movie part...but just know that I'll get there in time for the holidays.) Enjoy! ... Chapter Fourteen: Sailors of the Sky Bella stared at her Capn' Crunch, slowly growing soggy in the bowl. She was in absolutely no mood to talk to anyone this morning, not even Max. She glanced at Connie as she walked past. Guess I was wrong when I thought that grownups never lie , she thought, almost wishing that Connie could read her thoughts. The night of Max's first real fit was nothing compared to what had happened the previous night. Bella's father had been at the house, and he and Connie started arguing about something stupid, she couldn't even remember what it was. Once again, the kids had been sent to bed early, and for once, she was glad that she was able to keep to herself. She plugged her headphones in, almost going deaf from trying to block out the voices and the banging, the latter coming from Max's room. \"Bella, eat your cereal,\" Connie instructed. \"It'll get soggy.\" \"Maybe I want it to,\" Bella grumbled. \"Maybe I like it like that. Just like you seem to like your marriage soggy.\" Connie stopped and stared at her middle child. \"Bella, if this is about last night—\" \"You promised me.\" She was surprised tears were welling up in her eyes. \"You promised the three of us that you wouldn't fight when we were here.\" \"I know,\" Connie said. \"You're right. I'm sorry you needed to hear what we said last night. It wasn't fair to you.\" Bella went back to staring at the golden-yellow gunk that was now her cereal. \"That's what you always say. You say you'll do one thing, but then you don't even do it. Don't even try to make it up. It won't work this time.\" \"Okay. If that's what you want…\" Connie had that tone of voice that said, We're gonna do something fun today. You sure you want to miss it? \"It doesn't really matter what I want. You'll just do whatevery you want.\" \"So I take it you're going to stay home while I take Claire and Max to the apple orchard today?\" Bella fought to keep her excitement inside. The apple orchard was one of her favorite places to go, especially in the fall. It was the ideal family outing – even Claire remembered that she had younger siblings for a few hours. \"You're…going today?\" she asked skeptically. \"But it's Labor Day. We don't usually go until November.\" \"I figured that we should go early this year,\" Connie explained. \"Before the crowd gets too big.\" Bella narrowed her eyes. \"You're not trying to bribe me, are you?\" \"Where did you pick up a word like that?\" \"Why are you ignoring my question?\" Connie sighed, taking the bowl of cereal. \"Go grab a banana from the kitchen,\" she said. \"And get ready. We're leaving in an hour.\" ... The car ride was devoid of talking, as it always was. Connie had the radio on and was listening to a talk show; Claire and Bella both had their headphones in; and Max, exhausted from his tantrum the night before, was asleep. \"Girls?\" Connie's voice was sudden, and made Bella jump. \"Can I speak with you, please?\" \"Aren't you doing that right now?\" Claire asked. \"Don't get sassy with me, Claire,\" Connie said. \"Take your headphones out.\" Claire carefully removed hers and set them in her lap. Bella yanked hers out and flung them to her side. \"I'd like to talk to you about your father.\" Bella stared out the window. She tried to focus on the trees and the huge houses that dotted the landscape. \"I know I keep saying that he and I aren't gonna fight in front of you three anymore…\" Ooh, I like that house…if I ever grow up to be rich, I'm gonna live there… \"…things come up, and it's hard to deal with them without disagreeing on something…\" And that one can be my second house… \"…want what's best for you…\" Maybe I can build a barn and have some horses… \"…it'll end soon, I promise…\" I hate that word. Promise. It's just empty and hollow. It doesn't mean anything. \"Bella!\" \"What? What, Mom?\" \"I said, are you okay?\" Was she really? At the moment, she just wanted everyone to disappear. She wanted to be by herself, her life simple and not burdened with family problems. But she couldn't be selfish. Not at a time like this. \"I'm fine, Mom,\" she lied, going back to watching houses. \"I'm fine.\" ... The assembly line was up and running, and Bella considered it a good excuse as any to sneak away from her family. Much like house watching, she studied each apple carefully as the workers picked the good ones to put in baskets and let the bad ones fall into a bag. That one looks really good. Oh, wait. It's got a huge bruise. Never mind. Ooh, that one's gonna be picked for sure. But I'm not so sure about the one with the funny leaf— \"This is what you call fun?\" Claire was leaning on the railing beside her. \"Why do you care?\" Bella asked, her eyes on the apples. Claire got right to the point. \"You weren't listening in the car, were you?\" Bella shook her head. \"I've heard it all before. It's just a bunch of empty promises.\" \"You ever think that Mom's working her butt off to try to keep us together?\" Her sister's tone of voice was serious. Bella had never heard her use it before, and it was a bit frightening. \"That's crazy, Claire—\" \"If you'd been listening, you'd know that it's not. She's trying to get along with Dad, but it's hard, because they've still got taxes to pay, and Mom's job doesn't pay nearly enough—\" Bella didn't like it when anyone talked about not having enough money. She didn't want to think about what would happen if her family lost all their money and had nowhere to go. \"—and they want us to be happy. So I was right. They probably will get a divorce. It's the only way things can work, the way I see it.\" \"Shut up!\" Bella snapped. \"No one wants to hear what you think, Claire!\" Claire stepped back. \"Well, excuse me for trying to explain things!\" She huffed off, clearly angry. \"Good riddance,\" Bella mumbled, looking back to the assembly line in time to see it shut off and the workers carry the apples away. ... \"Who's picking apples back there?\" screamed the tractor driver. Bella smirked as the teenagers sat back down on the tractor, rolling their eyes at the driver. \"No picking apples off the trees while the tractor is in motion!\" the driver barked. \"It's against the rules!\" Tell that to the idiots at the back, Bella felt like calling. There was always someone on the tractor ride that didn't follow the rules, and that caused the driver to turn around periodically to make sure no one was trying anything funny. Unfortunately, it had gotten worse each year, so the driver now watched the passengers much more than he watched the road. Which wasn't helping anything, considering they were right about to run into a tree— The tractor bumped, and everyone flew into the air. Bella came down hard on her backside. \"Okay…ow,\" she said. The driver began to swear under his breath, turning around. \"This is why you kids shouldn't be allowed on this thing!\" he shouted. \"Make things worse…\" Welcome to my world, dude. ... Bella finished her apple turnover and stared moodily at the pond that was right next to the railroad tracks. The same idiots who had been on the tractor were now pushing each other, falling into the pond and laughing. Claire had gone to join them, finding them hilarious. Bella turned away from them. She didn't need to be reminded of what her sister had told her earlier about their mother and how they were having trouble paying bills and taxes and how— \"Hi.\" Max was sitting across from her, fiddling with a now empty candy apple stick. He wouldn't meet her gaze and stared at the ground. \"Hey.\" \"Did you hear what Mommy said in the car?\" \"Yes,\" Bella fibbed. \"Did you?\" \"A little,\" Max said. \"I was just waking up.\" She could tell that what Connie had said upset him. \"She's not mad at you,\" Bella said, not even trying to be comforting. \"It's her problem, and it doesn't concern us.\" Max looked at her. \"What if they get a…D-Force?\" He whispered the last word, as if he didn't want anyone to hear it. \"They're not gonna get a divorce, Max.\" Bella didn't want to talk about it anymore. \"Everything's gonna be fine.\" Max bent his stick. \"I don't know…\" \"Let's not talk about it anymore, okay?\" Bella tried to smile. \"We're here to have fun, remember?\" Max nodded, the hint of a smile on his face. \"I guess.\" Suddenly, the sun was blocked by a cloud. Or, she thought it was a cloud. But then came a peculiar sound, one that sounded like someone trying to blow up a balloon. \"What is that?\" Max asked. Bella looked up, and there, floating over the apple orchard, was a hot air balloon. It was huge, and she was awestruck by its size. People on the ground waved at the people in the basket. Some even took pictures. Max's eyes were huge. \"Is that a balloon?\" he asked excitedly. \"Yeah…\" Bella said. \"It's a hot air balloon. I didn't know they had rides here.\" \"They look like they're sailing!\" Max said. They stood for a moment, hypnotized. Then Max took off in a fast sprint. \"Let's follow it!\" he called. ... They came to an open field and found two more balloons prepping for flight. Other people had gathered to watch, admiring the balloons and jokingly complaining about how jealous they were of the people who got to ride in them. \"I wanna go on one!\" Max said. \"I'll go ask Mom for some money,\" Bella told him. \"These things probably don't cost too much…\" \"I wouldn't be so sure,\" said a woman standing nearby. Bella gave her a puzzled look. \"What do you mean?\" \"You wanna go on one of these things?\" the woman asked. \"Can we?\" Bella asked, still confused. \"Yeah, can we?\" Max's eyes were filled with excitement. \"I want to go sailing in the sky!\" \"Sorry, young man, but if you wanna ride one of these things, you gotta cough up some serious cash.\" She snapped a picture with her camera. \"I'm still saving to do so myself, and I started about half a year ago.\" \"How much do they cost?\" Bella asked, her heart sinking. \"Depends. They change the price all the time, but I'm guessing it's in the hundreds. So good luck finding money to ride in one.\" Bella turned away and looked at Max. He looked up at her. \"You don't think Mommy…\" Bella saw her mother across the field with Claire, watching the balloons. After all she'd learned today, Bella couldn't bring herself to even broach the subject of hot air balloon rides with her mother. \"Not today, Max,\" Bella replied. \"Now's not a good time.\" Max looked crushed. \"Oh.\" He looked up as a balloon took off and the people around them cheered. \"Don't worry, Max,\" Bella said. \"We'll ride in one of those balloons someday.\" \"Promise?\" She still hated that word, but couldn't find another way to put it. \"I promise, Max,\" she said, and they watched the balloon float away until it was out of sight.[Chapter 17] Hello again! Geez, third chapter this week...I guess it helps that I don't have a lot of homework! WHOOO! Anyway, the opening scene in this chapter is based on the opening scene in the movie (when Max and the dog are running around), and I don't own the movie, obviously. Also, the part at the end of this chapter concerning the Swine Flu...please note that I don't find it a humorous subject. Someone actually wrote that sentence in an English class of mine once, and we all found it pretty funny. So...yeah. Enjoy! ... FOUR YEARS AND A FEW MONTHS LATER... ... Chapter Fifteen: Reverence vs. Sarcasm Boom. Bang. Slam. Crash. Stumpy's frantic bark rang through the house. Max growled, close on Stumpy's heels, fork in hand and clad in his wolf suit. The pounded down the stairs, the noise escalating as they went. \"Max?\" Bella looked up from reading. \"Please tell me you're not—\" The duo was in the living room now. Bella leaped off the couch just as Stumpy flew onto the cushions, Max following. They bounced across and landed on the floor, continuing the epic chase. \"Max, come on!\" Bella was clearly not amused with this. \"You know how Mom hates it when you chase the dog around the house!\" He wasn't listening, as usual. All he cared about was the exhilarating rush he got from this, his wild side unleashed for a few precious moments. Bella caught him, pinning him down on the couch. \"SERIOUSLY.\" She looked him in the eye. \"You have got to stop this, Max. You're going to break something.\" The anger he radiated was prominent. \"Why can't you let me do what I want?\" He wiggled in her firm grasp, trying to break free. \"What you want is total destruction,\" Bella said. \"Things are different now.\" He twisted free and resumed his chase. \"ARRROOOOO!\" he howled. \"Max…\" She stood in the living room, motionless. How had her brother gotten so out of control? \"Bella!\" Max called. What could he possibly want? \" Isabella!\" Huh? Since when had he… ... \" Isabel! \" Bella jerked out of her daydream and saw Senora Walden standing in front of her, arms folded and eyes disapproving. Bella got this look often – it told her that she was in trouble. Again. \" Lo siento, Senora, \" Bella mumbled. \"I'm sorry.\" \" Tu no puedes dormir en mi clase, \" Senora Walden trilled angrily. \" No es aceptable! \" \" Yo se, \" Bella said. \"I know.\" But she didn't know. She had no idea what her teacher was saying. But, then again, maybe that was a good thing. The bell rang, and the students exited the classroom, some giggling at Bella's blunder. She grabbed her backpack and sadly trailed behind them. \" Isabel… \" Bella turned around, cringing mentally. \" Nesecitamos hablar, por favor. \" Bella sighed, and walked over to her teacher's desk, defeated. \"Can you tell me why you're here?\" Senora Walden asked in English. \"Because I sleep in class?\" \"Yes. Isabel , I know you're an intelligent young lady. You were doing so well in this class when you started out. And now you're down to a C. No es bien. \" \"I know it's not,\" Bella said. \"I try not to, I swear.\" \"Is everything okay?\" \"What do you mean?\" Senora Walden gave her a pointed look. \"What I mean, Isabel , is are you doing okay at home? I know your mother's been busy. Are you sure you're alright?\" Bella didn't appreciate it when people asked if she was alright. In truth, she wasn't. Her mother was too busy with work to spend time with her or her siblings; her father lived in the city and didn't call or visit as much as he used to; her sister was still as much of a witch as she'd been in her childhood; and her brother was growing restless, acting wilder and crazier each day. But she didn't feel like sharing this information with the world. Instead, she gave everyone the shortened, abridged version. \"Everything's fine, Senora ,\" Bella said. \"Well, one more instance like that in class, and I'm going to have to call your mother. You're grade is slipping pretty quickly.\" Bella nodded. \"You're in tenth grade now. Time to grow up, you know?\" Bella nodded again and hastily left the room. ... \"She said, 'one more instance like that in class, and I'm going to have to call your mother',\" Bella quoted. \"And then she told me to 'grow up'. This is so lame!\" \"She's always hated kids,\" Tori assured her. \"It's not your fault.\" \"Whatever.\" Bella sighed. \"My life is complicated enough without her telling me I'm close to flunking her class.\" \"Did something happen?\" Tori asked. \"Yeah,\" Bella said spitefully. \"My family happened.\" ... School dragged slowly. Economics was torture, as it always was. Bella fought to keep awake today, but found it difficult. Her mind wandered to Max and his startling change in behavior. Choir was better, but not by much. Bella was seated next to Rachel McEvans, who had a beautiful voice – and mad sure everyone knew it, too. \"I can't believe you're in Women's Choir,\" she said to Bella each day. \"I mean, no offense, but you're not good .\" \"I'm aware of that, Rachel,\" Bella said, growing angry. Rachel sighed dramatically. \"I suppose we all can't be as talented as I am.\" Bella fought the urge to push Rachel off her seat and into the piano, but knew it would result in detention, or worse, suspension. She kept her hands in fists the whole time. English was Bella's favorite class. The teacher, Mr. Patterson, actually knew what he was doing, in her opinion. It also helped that she liked to write. She had started a journal for story ideas the past year, and was always jotting a knew idea in it. \"I'm going to give you a piece of paper,\" Mr. Patterson told the class. \"On it is a tone word. When I say 'go', you're to write as much as you can on your paper using that tone.\" Bella looked at her slip. It said reverent , which meant respectful and worshipful. Bella was hoping for a darker tone, like melancholy or scornful . \"Everyone ready? Go.\" The students began to write. Bella knew she needed to first think about what to write before she started. But her pencil started to fly across the paper, anyway. My family is the best family ever, it wrote. No, Bella…don't do that. She couldn't do this now. My mother works so hard to provide for us. I only wish I could give her something in return. Why are you dwelling on it? Talking about it won't solve anything. My older sister is so wonderful. She's always helping out, and is the sweetest person anyone could ever meet. This is so dumb. Erase this and write something else. You still have time. My younger brother is adorable. He's so well behaved and mature for his age. Stop. Stop now. The pencil wouldn't hold still. Bella wrote furiously, almost making a hole in the paper. I only wish everyone could know how great my family is. \"Stop,\" Mr. Patterson said. Bella slammed her pencil down. She looked at her paper and groaned. She should have stopped when she had the chance. \"Who wants to read theirs out loud?\" Mr. Patterson asked. No one dared raise a hand. He scoped the room, looking for the perfect target. \"Isabella?\" Great. \"Um…I don't think it's very good…\" \"You'll never know unless you read it,\" Gerry Anne's shrill voice said from across the room. Bella felt her hands clench into fists, much like they had earlier in choir. \"Okay, I'll read it.\" Bella took a deep breath and read her paragraph, trying to disguise the disgust that was prominent. After she finished, Mr. Patterson nodded. \"Excellent. Anyone want to guess what tone she was using?\" Surprisingly, some of the students started to guess. \"Wistful?\" \"Whimsical?\" \"Reverent?\" Bella nodded at the third, although she desperately wanted to say, \"Sarcastic.\" Mr. Patterson nodded. \"Anyone else want to read?\" \"Greg does!\" Randy Hazrow pointed across the row to his buddy Greg.\" \"Yeah, Greggy!\" the other jocks whooped. \"He's got a really good one! It's hilarious!\" Greg shook his head. \"Dudes, no way! It sucks!\" \"I'll bet it's not that bad.\" Mr. Patterson took the paper and read the first sentence aloud. \"'It was summer. School was finally over, and already two of my friends had died from the Swine Flu…'\" The class erupted in fits of laughter. Bella cracked a smile, the first, it seemed, in a long time.[Chapter 18] Man, I'm on a roll with this! It's kinda scaring me. (jk, jk) This chapter's got a lot going on, so sorry if it's choppy. DISCLAIMER: Some of the aspects of this chapter (the character of Pamela, the character of Peter and his actions, the character of the man at Connie's work, the character of Gary and what Max does to him) are based off parts of the book The Wild Things by Dave Eggers. Which I don't own. Well, I own a copy, but I didn't write it. So I don't own the content. ... Chapter Sixteen: Through the Years \"Bella! You have a letter in the mail!\" \"Who's it from?\" She took the envelope eagerly. \"Your father.\" Bella quickly sat down at the dining room table and tore the letter open. She became momentarily frustrated, because she could never open an envelope properly. She always ended up ripping it to shreds. Bella scanned the letter, pleased that her father was doing well at his job (whatever that was – no one would tell her what his occupation was). She was, however, concerned that he was still dating Pamela, some bleached blonde bimbo who threw herself all over her father in a sickening way. He went on to ask how school was going, and if she was still hanging in there. Bella felt like telling him everything, but restrained herself not to do so. It would kill her to know that she was making things worse for her family. Then again…she wasn't the one who'd gotten a divorce. ... After her hot-air balloon promise to Max, the fighting began increasing rapidly. It reached an all-time high halfway through September, at which point their father packed the remainder of his things and declared he wasn't coming back. There was a lot of shouting and yelling, and a good portion of it was crying. She'd escaped and ran to Tori's that night, abandoning the broken remains of her family. \"I'm sure it wasn't that bad,\" Tori said. \"Tori!\" Bella sobbed. \"He's leaving!\" \"Maybe it won't be for a long time…\" \"He told my mom he's not coming back.\" Tori seemed to understand now. \"Ever?\" \"Ever.\" Tori became quiet. \"I'm so sorry, Bella.\" She put an arm around her best friend's shoulder. ... Bella went back the next day to salvage what she could, planning to head back to Tori's as soon as possible. This was when Connie dropped the bomb and told Bella what was to happen. \"We're getting a divorce.\" She said it evenly, no hitch in her voice. She didn't seem pleased or angered. She was calm about it, doing the crossword in the newspaper as she said it. Connie would get the house while their father was forced to find someplace else to live. Both felt that their children should be as far away from the divorce stress as possible, so Bella was allowed to stay at Tori's, Claire was going to stay with her friend Dana, and since Max was still very young, he would stay with their mother's parents. ... \"NO! I'M NOT LEAVING!\" \"Max, it's okay!\" Grandma Abby picked him up. \"We're gonna have fun at our house, aren't we?\" \"I CAN'T LEAVE!\" He looked at Bella, his eyes flashing with fear. \"BELLA, DON'T LET THEM TAKE ME!\" \"It won't be for long, Max,\" she mumbled. \"We'll be back home soon enough.\" \"BUT I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MOMMY AND DADDY! THEY CAN'T GET A DIVORCE!\" Tears streaked down his face and he shuddered when he breathed. Claire came down the stairs with a suitcase. \"I don't know how Mom and Dad can go through this,\" she said hurriedly as she hugged Bella and Connie goodbye. She ran out the door and climbed into the back of a pick-up truck. It was gone before anyone could blink. \"Max, you'll have fun at Grandma and Grandpa's,\" Connie said. \"They have all sorts of toys there, and you can watch TV—\" \"Bella's coming with me, right?\" Bella shook her head. \"I'm going to Tori's, Max. I…I need some time by myself. To think.\" She didn't want to look at Max, because she was sure that what she'd just said was breaking his little heart. And the worst part about it was that her words were true. \"Time to go, Max,\" Grandpa George said. \"Say goodbye.\" \"No! I don't wanna leave!\" He reached out for Bella. \"Bella, don't let them take me!\" She held his hand for a moment, looking into his sad, brown eyes. She felt torn; she could change her plans and tell Tori that she was staying with her grandparents, so Max wouldn't feel lonesome. But at the same time, she knew that going to Tori's was going to pay off in the long run. She needed time away from her family…her entire family. Her grandparents were walking out the door now. Max began one of his tantrums, pounding his fists against the seat of their grandparents' old car and screaming to be let out. The car started up and backed out of the driveway. As it drove away, Max looked out the back window, looking at her, pleading in his silent way. Bella waved and looked at her shoes. ... She spent almost two months at the Mikes' house. They treated her like she was their own, and even Tori's brothers were decent. Bella felt relieved to forget about her problems. Connie checked in every day to make sure she was alright. Bella was at first reluctant to talk to her, but tried not to focus on her anger when she did talk to her mother. Deep down, she knew she missed Connie and her siblings, although she wouldn't admit it to anyone, not even herself. ... After what seemed like eternity, Bella was finally able to come home. She learned that she and her siblings would primarily live with Connie, and they could see her father during the holidays and for a month and a half in the summertime. He had secured a house in the city, which was only about a half-hour drive away. Her mother was completely changed after that. She looked happier than she had in months, years even. A month after the divorce was final, she started to date again. She picked the strangest people to date, too. There had been Dave, the punk rocker; he had a billion tattoos and a nose ring. But he'd only lasted two weeks. His loud music woke up the three siblings at night, and Connie had deemed him a jerk, as well. After him had been Chris, a seemingly normal person. He was there for a month before Connie realized that he was gay and had only been dating her to figure this out. Bella remembered her mother wasn't too happy about that. Then came Peter, some random old guy. Bella was sure that he had been out of pure desperation. He gave Max a plant for a present, which the five-year-old promptly got rid of. After Connie broke it off at the two-month mark, he'd come by one night and started to sing under Connie's window, begging her to take him back. Everyone in the neighborhood had woken up at the sound, complaining to call the police. Connie forgave him and went out with him again, but only for a week. There'd been a few months of no one, and everyone, save Connie, was thankful. Then Connie had started to go out with someone at work, even though she denied it. Claire had even started defending her. Bella hated it when Claire and Connie had secrets between them. It made her feel left out. This one had lasted almost a year, but Connie found that he'd been cheating on her, and promptly broke it off. After that, she decided not to bring her dates home, so Bella had a hard time keeping track. However, after about three years of complete failure, her mother had secured a boyfriend. His name was Gary, and he'd been around for over a year. He was a few years younger than Connie, and a complete bonehead. He tried to be \"relatable\" to Bella and her siblings, but it only made him sound stupid. He was also not the sharpest knife in the drawer, and a thoroughly gullible person. In short, it was like having another kid around the house. Connie hadn't come out right away and told them she was dating Gary. She claimed he was \"just a friend\" of hers. She'd told the truth to Claire first, then to Bella. But she'd delayed telling Max for the longest time. Bella didn't understand why. Connie had started to date Gary when Max was about eight. That was a reasonable age to distinguish a friend from a boyfriend. However, in Connie's book, Max was still a baby, and his brain couldn't process this information properly. Bella got so sick and tired of her mother playing this game, that she came out and said exactly what she was thinking one night at dinner. ... \"Bella, sweetie.\" Connie stopped by her daughter's chair as she cleared the table. \"Is something wrong?\" Bella glared up at her mother. She couldn't take it anymore. \"When are you gonna stop pretending?\" Connie looked surprised. \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about this whole Gary business, Mom,\" Bella stated, as if it were obvious. \"Aren't you gonna tell Max what it's really about?\" Max looked from Connie to Bella, sensing something was wrong. \"What's she talking about?\" \"Nothing, Max,\" Connie insisted, glaring at Bella. \"Yeah,\" Claire mocked. \"Bella's just having one of her mood swings.\" \"I am not! I hate having to keep quiet about what goes on in your life, Mom, just because you think Max isn't old enough to deal with it! Well, news flash! He's almost eight! That's old enough to know about how you and Gary are dating!\" When Bella said the last sentence, Max's eyes went wide as he continued to look back and forth. \"She's…what?\" he asked, his voice cracking. \"Oh, this got so much better…\" Claire said to herself. \"Isabella Kaye!\" Connie was angry now. \"When were you gonna tell him, Mom? Seriously? When he's my age? When you've already gotten married to him?\" \"That's enough out of you, young lady!\" \"He's not a little kid anymore! You told me and Claire about it—\" \"Because I knew you could handle it! Now go to your room and stay there for the rest of the night!\" ... Max hated Gary the moment they met. Max sided with Bella on the fact that he was a moron, and went to extra lengths to give Gary a hard time when he was over. He'd hide the coffee and other things Gary needed when he stayed at their house, and Gary still hadn't picked up that Max was the culprit. Needless to say, Bella's life wasn't going how she'd planned it to. Everyone in her life was changing: her mother, her father, Claire, Max, even Tori, who'd started to date a self-proclaimed \"bad boy\". Bella began to spend more and more time by herself, trying not to face her problems head-on. She would soon learn, however, that this tactic was going to backfire.[Chapter 19] Hey all! Three days left until my holiday break! (And two more quizzes...yuck!) But I'm happy, anyway, cause I'm probably gonna have tons of time to update (under the circumstances that I'm not doing anything fun...LOL!) This chapter's kind of an oddball...it explores the girly side of Bella (something I wasn't originally planning...but it just kinda came out that way). I think the next one's gonna be from Max's POV (which means RESEARCH!), and I'll have it on as soon as I can. Happy Holidays! ... Chapter Seventeen: A Lucky Omen \"All right, everyone. Do you see a parabola?\" Bella unfolded her patty paper. This was the sixth time she'd tried this, and she still couldn't see a parabola. All she saw were a bunch of creases. She glanced out of the corner of her eye and saw that about half the class was in the same boat as she was. Whatever…I was never artistic, anyway… Her math teacher, Ms. Anderson, had told them the previous week that they'd be entering into the hardest chapter of Trigonometry today – and Bella could now see that she'd been right. She couldn't believe her mother had made her take something as difficult as this. Then again, Bella couldn't think of one time her mother had let her do something she wanted to do. All her life, it seemed like her parents had control over what she did, and she never got to do anything fun. She knew it sounded selfish, and that it wasn't entirely true, but as of late, it applied to her life perfectly. Bella shook herself out of her thoughts and tried to pay attention as Ms. Anderson droned on and on about how important parabolas were and how to find a parabola's focus, directrix, and other things. Bella wrote the notes down but didn't really absorb any of the information. Trig was her last class of the day, and she usually tuned out right about— BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Everyone groaned as the fire alarm continued to screech in the hallway. The school's alarm system was malfunctioning, and because of this, the students experienced at least three fire drills each week. The school refused to have it fixed, and why they did this was beyond Bella's thinking. \"Do we have to go outside?\" someone complained. \"Not unless they tell us to,\" Ms. Anderson said. \"Attention!\" came the voice of the principal. \"This is a fire drill. Everyone is to proceed outside immediately.\" A louder groan sounded through the students. Bella grabbed her coat and followed her teacher outside. ... Everyone huddled together on the sidewalk, trying to keep warm. Bella felt especially sorry for the kids who'd been in gym class; they looked extremely uncomfortable in their t-shirts and shorts. \"This is so dumb,\" Bella muttered to herself. \"You can say that again,\" said a boy behind her. Bella turned around and forgot to breathe for a second. Behind her was Nick Hunter, a tall lanky boy with brown hair who was in Claire's choir (a.k.a. the \"talented\" choir). He was a junior – a year older than Bella – and completely off-limits to someone like her (not that she wanted a boyfriend, anyway). It didn't mean, however, that she couldn't get tongue-tied around him. \"Um…oh…\" she said, feeling her face grow warm despite the cold. \"You're Claire's little sister, right?\" Bella tried to form words, but no sound came. Come on, Bella, do something! She started to nod, her mouth still open. \"Claire talks about you sometimes,\" Nick said. \"Um…yeah.\" He looked away, and Bella instantly knew that Claire hadn't been exactly nice when discussing her home life. \"She's no picnic, either,\" Bella blurted. She immediately wished she'd never said that. What if Claire had said that she was a brat? Simply stating something like Claire wasn't all peaches and cream would come off as a brat tendency, she was sure. Nick started to laugh. \"I know,\" he said. \"Mr. Henderson has to keep telling her to turn off her cell phone. It's practically glued to her hands.\" Bella emitted her loud laugh, and many people near them turned to look. She looked at her feet. \"Weirdo,\" she heard Rachel say. \"Hey, it's alright,\" Nick said. \"I think your laugh's kinda cute.\" Bella looked up. She couldn't talk again, only smile, and she was sure she looked completely ridiculous. The bell rang, signaling for everyone to go inside. \"So I'll see you around, right?\" Nick asked. \"Huh?\" she asked dumbly. \"You're in Women's, right?\" \"Yeah…\" \"Well, we're having auditions for show choir to anyone who's interested. You thinking about trying out?\" \"Show choir?\" \"Yeah. It was Mr. Henderson's idea. Didn't Claire tell you about it?\" Knowing Claire, she would have withheld this information from Bella because she was convinced that her younger sister could not sing and, therefore, wouldn't make it into show choir. Bella was determined to prove her wrong. \"No, she failed to tell me that,\" Bella said, surprised she was able to say a full sentence. \"But I'll think about it, I guess.\" \"Cool.\" Nick smiled. \"See ya.\" He walked away, hands in his pockets. Bella stood numbly on the curb. \"See ya,\" she said, and quickly hurried in when she saw that everyone else was gone. ... Bella was relieved when the final bell rang. She rushed out of the classroom, trying to beat the huge rush of students. Being in a huge high school with a ton of kids was never fun. Both stairwells were congested every day when school got out, and it took her forever to get to the bottom and walk all the way to the other end of the building to her locker. As she was walking through the commons, she spotted Claire talking with some of her idiot friends. Bella decided to ask her about show choir, since she'd neglected to tell her about it. \"Hey, Claire,\" she said, walking toward where the group of older teens were hanging out. The people around Claire started to snicker. Claire simply rolled her eyes. \"And you're talking to me because…?\" \"We're related, remember?\" Bella hated it when Claire played this game with her. \"Do we have to go over this again?\" Claire wore a cold smile on her face. \"I'm a senior, you're a sophomore. We don't associate. Ever .\" The subject of show choir fled from her mind. Bella frowned, even though it was practically invisible through her thick brown bangs. \"Why do you have to be so mean?\" was all she could manage to say. Claire's friends laughed even louder. \"What are you, five?\" Claire tossed her head as she turned her back to Bella. \"No, but I think someone else is,\" Bella muttered angrily as she walked away. Her older sister had never, unfortunately, grown out of her unkind ways, although Bella had secretly hoped she would. Her pocket vibrated, and Bella took out her phone. FunnyGrl297: Where r u? Leave it to her best friend to save the day. Bella sighed as she sent a text back to Tori. IzzyB13: I just got done talking to the Wicked Witch of West 4 th St. Where do you think I am? FunnyGrl297: Hrry up! I have fbulus nws! Knowing Tori, she guessed it had to do something with either boys or her hair. This was the perfect opportunity to tell her about her encounter with Nick. Bella quickly made her way to her locker and saw Tori waiting there. \"Oh. My. God. Guess what?\" She bounced up and down, her jet-black hair moving as she did. \"You got a haircut?\" Bella supplied, trying to sound excited. \"Well, yes, I did, actually,\" Tori said, fingering her glossy locks. \"But that's not it! Guess who's going on a date with Joey on Friday?\" She started squealing and bouncing, both at once. Bella's heart sank as she received this news. \"Seriously? I thought you two broke it off a week ago.\" \"We did…but then Joey called, and one thing led to another, and…\" Tori seemed too happy for words to continue. Bella didn't know what to say. She had a very strong opinion on her best friend's love life, especially when it came to her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Joey Gregson, who was known as a two-timing heartbreaker. However, she knew her friend's feelings were more important than anything she had to say about the relationship, so she kept her mouth shut. \"I'm happy for you,\" Bella fibbed, twirling the combination lock on her locker. \"I really am, Tori.\" \"Oh, I knew you would! That's why I'm glad you're my friend. Everyone else would say forget about it. But not you. You support me, no matter what. That shows true friendship.\" \"Thanks…\" Bella pretended to search for something in her locker, guilt eating at her insides. \"So, I saw you and Nick talking to each other today…\" A sly smile crossed her face. Bella tried not to blush. \"Yeah…so?\" \"So? You've been crushing on him since ninth grade! And he finally talked to you!\" \"Tori, I don't like boys…and boys don't like me.\" She slammed her locker door shut and faced her. \"He only knows who I am because of Claire.\" \"It's a start.\" Tori put on a fake pout. \"A lucky omen!\" \"Only in your dreams, Tori,\" Bella said. \"Are you doing anything after school?\" Tori began texting someone on her keyboard phone, her fingers moving swiftly up and down the keys. \"Yep. My mom wants me and Claire out by the car pool line as soon as possible,\" Bella answered, walking beside Tori. \"We're picking up Max at his after school daycare thing. It's some new deal that we'll be doing for the rest of the year.\" \"Max?\" Tori said the word as if she were trying to get a bad taste out of her mouth. \"You mean your bugger of a brother who's out of control?\" \"I wouldn't say that,\" Bella defended. \"He's just going through a difficult time in his life.\" \"You mean he started puberty early?\" \"No.\" Bella gave Tori a funny look. \"I have no idea what's going on in his head. He just seems troubled, is all.\" She paused. \"I kinda missed how it used to be.\" \"Ugh, it sucks that you have to pick him up!\" Tori said, returning to the topic. \"Tell your mom that you can come home with me on the bus and hang out for a while, and then you could walk home after. I mean, we only live four blocks away from each other.\" \"Thanks…but…my mom doesn't like me going over to friends' houses on school nights,\" Bella said, swimming for an excuse that wasn't entirely a lie. \"She says it does no good for my grades.\" \"Well, whatever! We're gonna convince her that you should come over.\" \"It's gonna take a lot of convincing,\" Bella said as they pushed open the doors of the school. \"Hello! I'm taking debate this semester. I knew it'd come in handy sooner or later.\" A horn honked, and the girls turned to see a sleek black SUV in the front of the car pool line. \"That's my mom.\" Bella gave Tori a quick hug. \"See you later.\" \"I'll text you!\" Tori called after her friend as Bella hopped into the SUV.[Chapter 20] Chapter Eighteen: Rocky Relationships \"So…how was school?\" Connie, asked in the car. \"Sucked,\" Claire mumbled, playing with her Sidekick. \"You know I hate that word,\" Connie said sternly. \"Whatever.\" \"How about you, Bella?\" Connie looked in the rearview mirror at her other daughter. \"It's school, Mom.\" Bella tore her gaze away from the window. \"Nothing happens at school except homework. And how exciting is that?\" \"I'm just curious,\" Connie said. \"The three of you never talk about what goes on there.\" \"Well, if it helps, we started the hardest chapter in Trig today.\" Claire snorted from the front seat and plugged her headphones into her ears. Bella ignored her. \"And what would that be?\" Connie asked. \"Parabolas, circles, ellipses…that type of thing. And it's HARD.\" \"Sounds interesting.\" Bella couldn't believe her ears. \"I just said it was hard, Mom. Not interesting.\" \"Can't it be hard and interesting?\" \"No.\" Connie shrugged. \"Okay, if you say so.\" Bella folded her arms. \"I still can't believe that you made me sign up for that class. You know I've never been good at math.\" \"By taking challenging classes, you learn, sweetie.\" \"You won't be saying that when I flunk out.\" \"You won't flunk out.\" Bella sighed. Sometimes her mother could be completely clueless. Connie turned to Claire. \"Claire, when are those auditions for show choir?\" \"Tomorrow,\" she said. \"Oh, that's right,\" Bella piped up from the backseat. \"There's auditions for show choir! Guess who didn't tell me about that, Mom?\" Connie was silent. Claire turned and gave a nasty look to Bella. \"Maybe I didn't tell you because I knew you'd get like this,\" Claire said. \"No, you didn't tell me because you know I'm a lousy singer. And you didn't want me ruining your precious show choir.\" \"Girls, please,\" Connie said. \"Can't you just try to get along for once?\" \"Uh, no,\" they said in unison. Connie shook her head. \"Why can't you both try out for show choir?\" \"Because she's my little sister!\" Claire complained. \"I don't want her tagging along everywhere I go!\" \"And you also think I can't sing,\" Bella added. \"Would you let that go?\" Claire snapped. \"I could care less if you can sing or not!\" \"I said, knock it off!\" Connie shouted. The two siblings fell silent. \"Okay, it's not the crime of the century if Bella—\" \"Why are you taking her side?\" Claire asked. \"That's so not fair!\" \"I'm not taking anyone's side,\" Connie said. \"All I said was—\" \"Yeah, she's not taking a side, Claire,\" Bella said smugly. \"So shut up!\" \"BOTH OF YOU BE QUIET!\" Connie yelled. Silence engulfed the car a second time. \"You can both try out for show choir. There's no law against it.\" \"But—\" Claire began. \"End of story,\" Connie said firmly. ... Max didn't like his after school daycare. Most of the kids there were younger than him, and he couldn't tolerate little kid things for very long. Instead, he sat at one of the low tables, trying to concentrate on his homework – something that greatly scared him (since he usually blew off his homework until the last minute). As he was trying to figure out how many bananas five monkeys could each have if there were 35 bananas in all, he felt a tug at his sleeve. \"Max! Come on and play!\" This was Gabbie, one of the more annoying children. Max had no idea why she was compelled to ask him to play – it was very clear that he didn't want to do so. Bella had suggested that Gabbie had a crush on Max, but he thought that it was a ridiculous idea. Besides, Gabbie was only six. She didn't know what a \"crush\" was. \"Not now, Gabbie. I'm busy.\" \"Please?\" She tugged harder on his sleeve. \"I'll play tomorrow,\" Max said, knowing it was an empty promise. \"I'd like to get this done. Please go away.\" \"PLEASE, Max!\" Gabbie was persistent, clasping onto his arm and trying to drag him away. \"Let go of me!\" Max jerked his arm out of her hold, causing her to fall. Oh, no… Max thought. Along with being one of the most aggravating human beings he'd ever met, Gabbie was also the most prone to crying fits. He prayed silently that she wouldn't start one now. \"Gabbie, please don't…\" It was too late. Her wails were high-pitched, and they probably would have broken some windows if the person in charge, a recent college grad named Betsy, hadn't intervened. \"Gabbie, what's wrong?\" she asked gently. \"Max pushed me!\" \"I did not!\" Max protested. \"She was bugging me and I told her to go away.\" \"Did you get hurt?\" Betsy asked, completely ignoring Max. Gabbie sniffled and nodded. \"Come on, we'll go get some animal crackers,\" Betsy said. She turned to Max. \"I'd like to have a word with you when your mother gets here.\" ... Max sat in one of the free chairs in Betsy's office. Next to him were Connie and Bella (Claire had volunteered to stay in the car), and behind the desk was Betsy. \"Mrs. Carson,\" she said. \"This is the seventh time this month that Max has caused a disturbance in the delicate balance of my after school class.\" Delicate balance…what a bunch of baloney! Please tell me Mom's not buying this… \"What did he do?\" Connie asked. \"Well, today he pushed down one of the other children—\" \"I pulled my arm away! I didn't push her! She was annoying me and wouldn't stop!\" \"Not according to Gabbie,\" Betsy said. \"Gabbie's always making stuff up! I would never push anyone over!\" \"He's right,\" Bella said quietly. \"Pushing someone over doesn't sound like him at all.\" Thank God for Bella. Even if she was starting to distance herself from the rest of the family, Max knew he could count on her. \"Betsy, I'm terribly sorry if Max did anything wrong. He's usually not like this,\" Connie said. \"One more instance, and he'll be suspended for a month,\" Betsy said. \"This disruptive behavior cannot continue as long as I'm around.\" \"I understand. Thank you.\" Connie got up, and Bella and Max followed to the car. ... \"Max, what's gotten into you?\" Connie asked on the drive home. \"I don't know,\" Max answered honestly. \"Mom, he's too old for that daycare,\" Bella said. \"Can't you move him to an older center?\" \"For your information, Iz,\" Claire said, \"Mom can't afford it at the moment.\" \"Claire, please,\" Connie cautioned. \"I can handle this.\" She sighed. \"Bella, we don't have the money right now to switch Max out, okay? It'll happen. Just not in the near future.\" Max stared out the window, off in his own world. He wanted today to end so that it could forever be in the past and never come back into his memory. ... In Max's room was a globe, one of the really nice ones you could get at a consignment shop. On the nameplate it said, To Max: The Owner of the World. Love, Dad. He'd received it for his eighth birthday, the last one with both of his parents. Max stared at it now, wondering how one could be an \"owner of the world\". Did you simply have to own a globe? Or did you have to rise to power and be a monarch? All this thinking made him confused. He heard singing coming from the room next door. It was Bella, practicing for some choir she and Claire were going to be in. Claire, of course, thought Bella couldn't sing, and therefore didn't believe she'd make it in. And knowing Bella, Max guessed that his sister was going to try her hardest to show Claire up. He spun the globe once, watching the countries blur into one, then slowly separate out. He did it again, loving how each unique shape blended and then came apart. Bella was suddenly in the doorway. \"Hey,\" she said. Max turned. \"Hey.\" \"Um…I was just wondering if…\" It's about that dumb singing thing, isn't it? Max himself didn't really like to sing, unless it was for the purpose of annoyance. But his sister needed his support, and he was going to give it to her. It was the least he could do after she'd stood up for him that day. \"…would that be okay?\" Max looked at her blankly. \"Huh?\" \"Would it be okay if I sang a little bit?\" she repeated. Max nodded. \"Okay.\" A blush crawled up her face. \"I don't know why I'm so nervous…I'm usually not when I sing at home. But I guess now that I have to try out, and I probably won't make it—\" \"You don't know that,\" Max said. Why doesn't she just get it over with? \"Okay.\" Bella took a deep breath and began to sing on \"ah\". The minute she started, Max knew what she was singing. He tried not to cover his ears. It was the dreaded Love Theme, something Bella sang all the time. What's so special about that stupid song? Sure, it's soothing…and kinda nice…but totally stupid! Ugh! Stop singing! Why don't you stop singing… Max had heard it so much, he'd grown accustomed to it. But now that Bella was singing in front of him and not behind the wall, it sounded…almost pretty. When she was done, she looked at him expectantly. \"Well?\" \"It's nice, Bella,\" he said honestly. \"I liked it.\" Now please get out so I can be by myself. \"You really think so?\" Max nodded. \"Yeah.\" Why won't she leave? \"Thanks, Max,\" Bella said, walking over to him and hugging him. \"That means so much.\" Max sat for a moment, completely disgusted. Why did girls have to be so emotional? It didn't make any sense to him. But soon he found his own arms coming around his sister, and that he really needed a hug after the day he'd had. And after Bella had gone to sing for Connie, Max found himself wishing that she'd never left.[Chapter 21] Here's another chapter! Happy Holidays! =) ... Chapter Nineteen: Grounded ISABELLA CARSON VARSITY CHOIR SOPRANO II That image would be etched into her head for the rest of her life. Even as she sat in the choir room for her first day of show choir, she still couldn't – no, refused – to believe that she had made it into the \"good\" show choir. After auditions, Mr. Henderson, the choir director, had announced that since so many people had tried out for show choir, he was splitting it into two groups – a Women's and a Varsity (both men and women). According to most of the student body, the Varsity was supposed to be the better of the two, with Women's being for anyone who wasn't talented to get into the former. Claire was already sitting in the front row, talking with Rachel and a few others Bella recognized from Claire's choir. They all watched her sit near the back, giggling as they went back to their conversation. Typical Claire-and-posse response , Bella told herself as she took out a book. Can't let it get to you. \"Hey you!\" Bella looked up to see a tall girl standing right by her chair. The girl had her arms folded and was frowning. \"What?\" Bella asked. \"You're new here, aren't you?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, you're new to singing, right?\" Bella shook her head. \"I'm…I'm in Women's Choir.\" \"Oh. Well, I'd suggest you put that book away.\" the girl said, \"The serious singers don't read when they're in here. Unless, of course, you won't mind if everyone who walks in here thinks you're a freak.\" \"Too late,\" Bella sighed, casting a glance to where her sister sat. \"My sister's already taken care of that.\" \"You're Bella?\" The girl seemed astonished. \"You're a lot nicer than Claire says you are.\" Bella nodded. \"So I've been told.\" She made a mental note to get Claire back later. \"My name's Tiana,\" the girl said. Bella waved. \"It's very nice to meet you.\" Tiana peered at her quizzically. \"You don't wanna be here, do you?\" Bella shifted uncomfortably. \"What makes you say that?\" \"You're not making eye contact,\" Tiana stated simply. \"Dead giveaway. So why is it that you don't wanna be here?\" \"It's not that I don't wanna be here,\" Bella explained. \"It's that I shouldn't be here. I can't sing; it's a proven fact. During tryouts, I sounded horrible. And I didn't know that show choirs had to dance.\" \"That's why it's called show choir,\" Tiana said, clearly unimpressed. \"I wasn't thinking at the time. Anyway, I can't dance to save my life, and I screwed that up, too. Yet somehow here I am.\" Tiana sat down next to her. \"Mr. Henderson must think you're worth something. Either that, or he's getting sick and tired of Rachel and Claire and their mansion-sized egos and decided to put someone pleasant in his choir.\" Bella shrugged. \"I'll ask him once we're done.\" Tiana looked nervous. \"I don't think that's—\" \"Oh, no.\" Bella saw Nick enter the room and quickly put her book in front of her face. \"What? It's just Nick.\" Tiana waved. \"Yo Nick!\" Nick waved back and came over. \"Hey, Tiana. Who's your friend?\" \"This is Bella.\" Tiana removed the book from her face. \"Oh, hey,\" Nick said, his smile growing. \"I forgot to say that I loved your face at tryouts.\" Bella felt her face reddening. \"Oh, yeah…you taught us the dance…\" she said stupidly. \"And…then you watched…\" Nick laughed. \"Well, let me just say that you were so hilarious. You looked so determined when you were dancing.\" He imitated the way she'd looked. \"I swear, I was laughing for two hours after auditions were over.\" Bella noticed Tiana getting a sly smile on her face. She wasn't sure if she liked it. \"Hey, we'll talk afterward, okay?\" He went to sit in the front row. \"See ya, T.\" \"See ya,\" she said, still smiling. ... Bella stayed afterward to talk to Mr. Henderson. He wasn't very tall, but he had an air about him that made him seem bigger and tougher than he was. \"I was just wondering why you put me in choir,\" Bella said. He was shifting through papers at his desk and didn't look up. \"Um, I think you made a mistake.\" \"I never make mistakes,\" he said. \"Not when it comes to my students.\" \"But I can't sing. And I can't dance. It doesn't add up to where I am right now.\" \"And where would that be?\" \"I'm in regular Women's Choir and Varsity show choir. But I don't think I should be there.\" Mr. Henderson looked up for the first time. \"Are you saying I should switch you out?\" Bella nodded. \"I guess that's what I'm trying to say.\" Mr. Henderson sighed. \"Look, Miss Carson. I wasn't lying when I say I never make mistakes about my students. And I most definitely haven't made a mistake with you. You're exactly where you're supposed to be.\" \"But I—\" \"Let me finish,\" Mr. Henderson interrupted. \"I've heard you sing solo before. And I believe you have untapped talent, my dear.\" \"You do?\" Bella blinked, unable to believe that he'd said that. \"Yes, I do. So I hope that answers your question.\" Bella nodded, unsure of what to say. \"Yeah. I'll…just go now.\" \"See you tomorrow,\" he called as she shut the door. ... Claire was giving her the cold shoulder. It was normal for her species to do so when they were extremely angry. \"I'm glad that both of you made it,\" Connie said at the dinner table that night. \"Thanks, Mom,\" Bella offered, annoyed that Claire was acting stupid. \"Subject change,\" Claire muttered. \"Oh, Claire, be a good sport,\" Connie said. Claire rolled her eyes. \"Whatever.\" Connie turned to her youngest. \"Max, how was school today?\" Max played with his food, spellbound by his mashed potatoes. \"Max?\" He looked up. \"Oh. Yeah. It was fine.\" \"Anything interesting at all?\" \"No.\" Connie looked worried, but ploughed on. \"How was daycare?\" Max's grip tightened on his fork. \"Decent,\" he finally got out, although it was clear that his experience had been anything but. \"That's nice,\" she said, distracted. She cleared her throat and said, \"Are any of you doing anything on Friday?\" \"Dana's house. Duh,\" Claire said. \"I'm not doing anything,\" Bella said. \"Why?\" \"Gary's coming over for dinner.\" Bella's shoulders went slack. Claire rolled her peas around the plate. Max looked as if he were about to stab somebody. \"Be nice,\" Connie warned them. \"He makes an effort to be nice to you kids…\" \"More like he is a kid,\" Bella mumbled. Connie gave her a look. \"Bella. Not now.\" \"You know it's true, Mom.\" Connie got up from the table. \"Bella. Kitchen. Now. \" Bella followed her mother into the kitchen, her arms folded. \"What have I told you about opening your mouth about Gary?\" Bella looked at the floor. She wasn't going to answer. \"I've told you a thousand times not to say anything. It's rude and demeaning.\" \"So I don't like the guy. Big deal.\" \"It is a big deal if you keep making it into one.\" Connie shook her head. \"I honestly don't know what to do with you, Bella, I really don't.\" Like I haven't heard that one before… \"Sorry if I'm such a hassle to be around, Mom,\" Bella said sarcastically. \"That's not what I said—\" \"Excuse me for ruining your wonderful life.\" \"Isabella, don't get smart with me—\" \"Because it's obvious that Gary's more important than your own daughter.\" \" Isabella Kaye. \" Bella stopped, pursing her lips to prevent any more of her thoughts from escaping through her mouth. \"This behavior is obviously not going to go away, so until you can rejoin us like a normal human being, you're grounded. Bella looked at the ceiling, not really caring. \"How long this time?\" \"The weekend.\" Bella looked at her mother. \"I have no plans, anyway,\" she pointed out. \"Well, then, it works out.\" Her mother brushed past her and went back to the dining room. ... My Weird, Crazy Dream – Part II As told in 1 st Person by Bella Carson Well, there I am again, in the middle of all those…monster things. And there's Max, in his wolf suit and crown. But instead of ordering me to be devoured like last time, he narrows his eyes. \"What are you doing here?\" he asks. \"I have no idea,\" I admit. \"You shouldn't be here. We don't want you here, do we?\" He turns to the creatures for solace, but gets none because they're all busy sniffing me. \"She smells funny,\" says one with a horn on its nose. \"She looks funny, too,\" says another that looks like a goat. \"How do you know her?\" asks the largest, one with a striped body and horns on its head. \"She's my vampire sister,\" Max says disgustedly. \"And she hates me.\" ... Later that night, when she'd awoken from her crazy dream, Bella lay awake in bed. She let out a frustrated sigh and let angry tears roll onto her bedspread. She was used to being punished for running her mouth, especially since the groundings had been more frequent as her feelings continued to spin out of control. She didn't know why she was so upset about this one time; it was just like all the other times she had spent – and would spend – in her room on the weekends. The door opened, and hall lights spilled into the room. \"Bella?\" came Max's voice. Bella sat up. \"What? What happened, Max?\" \"I had a bad dream,\" he said. \"Oh.\" She allowed him to climb onto the bed. He laid his head against her shoulder, hugging his teddy bear. \"You got eaten by a monster,\" Max said. \"And I was there, and I was scared and I didn't do anything. But I tried. I really did.\" \"I'm sure you did,\" she said, rubbing his shoulder. He looked up at her. \"Bella…you're not going anywhere…are you?\" She shook her head. \"No, I'm not, Max. I'm right here. It's okay.\" \"Can I sleep in here?\" Bella nodded. \"Yeah. Go ahead.\" He lay down and pulled the covers up to his nose. \"Can you sing?\" \"Um…sure…\" Bella had no idea why he was asking her this. She knew for a fact that he wasn't too fond of singing. \"It'll help me sleep,\" he said. Bella nodded again, and began to quietly hum the Love Theme. Before she knew it, Max was fast asleep. She tried to fall back asleep, but didn't do so until much later. She was still plagued with thoughts about her punishment. Usually she wasn't sorry about what she'd said when she got grounded. But this time she had a sickening feeling that this time had been a huge mistake.[Chapter 22] Hey! I finally made it to the movie plot! *crowd cheers* It took me two months, but I finally did it! I would've been there sooner, but you guys motivated me to extend this story out, and I'm honestly astonished by the support I'm receiving! Thanks everyone! Enjoy and Happy Holidays! ... Chapter Twenty: The Snow Day Igloo Tuesday and Wednesday blended into one: school, then home, then school, then home again. Bella figured that it didn't matter anymore considering she was grounded for the whole weekend. Thursday, however, would be the real start of the conflict. It had snowed the night before, and it was everywhere; in people's yards, in the streets, some had even fallen in a few chimneys. They'd gotten over a foot, so school was closed, and the younger kids in the neighborhood were already outside making the most of the snow day. Bella hated it. Because of school being cancelled, today counted as a \"weekend\" day in Connie's book. Bella was to stay in the house and do her homework, and under no circumstances was she to go outside. She tried to act like she didn't care, but inside she desperately wanted to go out. She sat at the window seat, the afternoon sun lighting her room. She was stuck on another Trig problem, and tried to stay focused. But it was hard. She would much rather observe what was going on outside. Since Claire had watched movies all morning and had made plans with her friends for the afternoon, that left Max to entertain himself however he wanted. Today he had decided to build an igloo. Bella had watched him work diligently the whole day, and she found herself wishing she could go and help with the construction. In fact, she could go and build an igloo herself, with Max's help. Then they could have a huge snowball fight, and do all the fun things they used to when they were younger— Bella stopped herself. She needed to focus on something else. Claire would be up to check on her any minute now, ready to bust her for not finishing her homework. I wish Max had someone to play with, Bella thought to herself. Claire's obviously not gonna do it. She pushed the idea out of her head, going back to her impossible math problems. ... Max stepped back and looked at his masterpiece. It was truly an amazing fort, and he felt proud to call it his. If only his sisters could see it… He ran to the kitchen window. Inside, Claire sat talking on the phone. \"Claire!\" he shouted. \"The snow plough left a huge pile of snow across the street!\" Claire didn't acknowledge him. \"Claire! I made a fort! You gotta come see it!\" \"Max, not now. I'm on the phone,\" she said impatiently. \"Go play with your friends.\" Max didn't have any friends who lived in his neighborhood. And he couldn't bike over to the ones who lived close, not in this weather. He knew he'd been defeated. He unhappily looked up at the second-level windows of the house and saw Bella looking at him. She'd been watching him the whole day, and now was the time to summon her out of her homework stupor. \"Bella! Open your window!\" Bella pulled up the window locks and pushed it open. \"What, Max?\" she called down. \"You wanna come see my fort?\" He pointed across the street. \"The snow plough left it last night! Isn't it amazing?\" \"Sure is.\" He could tell that Bella had an itching to go over and check it out up close. \"You wanna have a snowball fight? Or I can be a general and you and the fencepost can be soldiers!\" The list of possibilities was endless. \"Sorry, Max,\" Bella said. \"I'm grounded today.\" Max felt his heart sank, but quickly covered his disappointment with annoyance. \"What for this time?\" he asked, his eyes rolling. \"Talking back to Mom about Gary. What else?\" That explained why she'd been in her room most of the week. It was normal for Bella to be there nowadays. Max looked up at her empathetically. \"Oh. Well, when are you gonna be able to come out?\" \"I don't know. Probably after the weekend's over.\" \"Well, when you're done, and if there's still snow, then will you come out and play?\" He suddenly wanted to be like the knights in his books, to rescue his sister from the house and bring her to the safety of his igloo. Bella shrugged. \"Maybe. I might be busy. We'll talk later, okay? Mom doesn't want me talking to anyone while I'm punished.\" \"But—\" \"I promise, Max, I'll talk to you later.\" She shut the window abruptly, cutting off the conversation. He slowly trudged back to his fort, alone. He found the perfect stick and a plastic bag rolling across the street. He tied the bag to the stick and declared the igloo to be his official lookout. He ordered the fencepost to do his bidding while he sat in the comfort of his fort, making snowballs. He suddenly had a brilliant idea. ... A while later, a beat-up car pulled into the driveway, rap music blasting from its speakers. High school boys and girls piled out, loud and obnoxious as they always were. Something wicked this way comes… Bella thought. She turned back to her homework. Now that Claire and her friends were in the same place, they'd somehow find a way to ruin something, and she didn't plan to watch them do it. A splat was heard outside. Max was smiling happily, standing by his igloo. And snow was now dripping down the face of one of Claire's friends. Bella started laughing her incredibly loud laugh. She found it very funny that Claire and her high school posse were being taken down by a nine-year-old boy and his snowballs. But in the midst of her amusement, Bella had completely forgotten that some of Claire's friends were high school boys. Senior high school boys. Stupid senior high school boys. And they took challenges seriously. No sooner had she stopped laughing that the snowballs started flying like crazy. Poor Max had to dive into his igloo for shelter, but the young boy – and the igloo, for that matter – didn't stand a chance. The bigger boys tore through it, trying to find him. The snow caved in and fell on top of him. He was completely submerged. Bella felt her heart bottom out. The high school boys dug through the snow, and out came Max, cold and wet. The boys went back to the driveway, where Claire and the others stood. Claire, instead of going over to help Max, had an angry look on her face. Bella got up from the window seat and stormed down the stairs. This had to end. \"Claire!\" she shouted as she stood in the doorframe. \"What was that all about?\" \"Chill, mini-dudette!\" one of Claire's friends said. \"We were just havin' some fun with the kid.\" Max stood in the midst of his ruined fort, tears pouring out of his eyes. Bella saw this and gave the group of older teenagers the Death Glare. \"Oh, yeah. He's having the time of his life.\" \"Seriously, Bella,\" Claire said, clearly irritated. \"Don't you have homework to finish? And aren't you supposed to be inside today?\" This caught Bella off-guard. \"I…I'm technically inside. I'm standing in the doorframe. That…that doesn't count as being outside.\" \"It will to Mom…\" Claire flashed her younger sister a glower as the girls started to snicker. They piled back into the car and drove away. Bella rolled her eyes and was about to shut the door when she stopped. Max continued to stand by his destroyed igloo. He stared after the car, and Bella could see Claire glance back at him, giving him a look that almost made her run at the car and throw a brick through the windshield. Max shook his head, his body tremoring with anger. He practically knocked into her as he bolted into the house. He pounded up the stairs, and a moment later, a door slammed. Bashes and slams came from the upper level. Bella closed the door, bewildered. Everything had happened so fast, she didn't know what to make of it. All she knew was that Max was upset. But she couldn't blame him. Claire could be a witch sometimes. Her friends were complete idiots. There was nothing anyone could do to change that. However, this time, they'd gone too far. Bella wished she could do something, but knew it was hopeless. Claire had been like this for years, and they were way past the point of no return. All Bella could do now was go up the stairs, back to her Trig homework. Ten minutes later a note was slid under her closed bedroom door. Bella picked it up. It was on construction paper and in crayon, two things that immediately told her that this note was from Max. She opened it, big red letters hitting her full force. You could have stopped them. You didn't help me. I HATE YOU.[Chapter 23] Thanks to CarolJudithFan for helping me with this chapter. You rock my sox! ... Chapter Twenty-One: What Max Did Bella promptly crumpled up the paper and dropped it. Max didn't mean what he said. They told each other \"I hate you\" all the time, but in a joking manner. She needed to take into account that he was still upset about Claire. She found his door shut and knocked. \"Max, it's me.\" \"Go away!\" She folded her arms. \"Max, seriously. Open the door.\" \"No!\" \"I'm coming in…\" she warned, her hand on the doorknob. The door swung open to reveal a blotchy-faced Max in his long underwear. The contempt in his eyes almost convinced her that the note had been for real this time. \"I told you to go away!\" he said angrily. \"And I told you to open the door, which you did,\" Bella pointed out. \"So at least we're getting somewhere.\" Max said nothing, his mouth pursing in frustration. \"You know I'm grounded,\" Bella continued. \"Claire's probably gonna bust me for merely standing in the threshold with the door open, because apparently that counts as being outside.\" \"Well…\" Max seemed unable to say anything for a moment. \"Now do you get why I couldn't help?\" \"Just standing there yelling at them didn't do anything!\" he practically shouted. \"We learned at school the other day that if you let someone be bullied, it's just as bad as doing the actual bullying! You saw them practically kill me! Why didn't you help?\" \"I just explained this to you!\" Bella said incredulously. \"I was grounded—\" \"I would have told Mom everything!\" Max interrupted. \"Claire would've gotten to her first, and besides, you know how Mom gets when she knows that we've been fighting.\" Angry tears rolled down her brother's face. \"Just go away.\" He began to shut the door. \"Max…\" She caught the door with her foot. \"Don't bother coming in here anymore. You wouldn't care, anyway,\" he said as he shut the door. Bella groaned inwardly. She knew it was no use arguing when Max got like this. She once again found the only solution was to go back to her homework, and try to avoid talking to her mother about the day's fiasco. As she walked down the hallway, she noticed melted snow on the hardwood floor. There was a trail of it leading to forbidden territory – Claire's room. She rarely went into her sister's room. It was certain death even thinking about it. But her curiosity got the better of her. She couldn't help opening the door to take a quick peek. The melted snow prints and broken Popsicle sticks were all she needed to see. After making sure Max's door was closed all the way, she tiptoed into the room and looked around. After a few minutes, she finally recognized the Popsicle sticks as a valentine Max had made Claire the year before. Only now it was a pile of sticks and paper. And on top of that, her room was trashed, water soaking the carpet. Oh, Max…you were doing so good at not losing your temper like this… It was true. As he had gotten older, Max's behavior became more severe. He'd do something completely stupid, whether it be on accident or on purpose, and then later regret doing it in the first place. And it was often very extreme, and it scared Bella to know that he was capable of doing things like that. She often wondered how her brother's mind worked and why he'd get so upset over things. As of late, he'd kept his outbursts in check – until ten minutes ago. Although she didn't blame Max for being angry with their older sister, it didn't give him the right to destroy her room like he had. ... Unbeknownst to Bella, Max had snuck into her room right after he'd trashed Claire's room and took the one thing he knew she cherished most: the dragon claw necklace he'd gotten her for her birthday a few years ago at the renaissance fair. He planned to do away with it like he had with Claire's room; only this time…he'd do something even worse. He held a hardcover book, poising it just above the marble part of the necklace. Paper and a messy room could be put back together, but marble would be too difficult to do the same. He'd show Bella that he could be mean, too. Max tried to bring his arms down, but he found he couldn't do it. Just staring at the necklace made him think about how wrong his actions were – not just what he was about to do, but what he had done only a few minutes before. What was the purpose of all this? His actions frightened him, and he immediately wanted to go into Claire's room and somehow extract all the water and fix the valentine. But there was no going back now. What was done was done. He looked at the dragon claw and realized what he had to do. I'll just sneak into her room and put it back— An ear-shattering scream came from down the hallway. \"MAX!\" Too late. Hoping not to get in trouble, he stuffed the necklace up the sleeve of his shirt just as he heard to doorknob turn. She burst into his room, furious. \"Did you take my dragon claw necklace without asking?\" Max sat still, frozen with fear. \"You did, didn't you?\" \"Bella—\" \"Where is it?\" Max shrugged. As he did, the necklace came out of his sleeve and clattered to the floor. Bella scooped it up, clearly angry with him. \"First Claire's room, and now this? I swear, Max, sometimes…you can be so stupid!\" She threw the necklace at his arm. \"You know what? Keep the dumb thing! Do whatever you were gonna do with it! It's all yours!\" She stormed down the hall and slammed the door, leaving Max feeling awful. ... \"I'm home!\" Connie called. I'm dead, Max thought to himself as he lay in bed. He held Bella's necklace close as Connie cracked the door open. \"Hey, sweetheart,\" she said, sitting on the edge of his bed. \"You have a good day?\" The day's events smacked him in the face. Tears poured from his eyes as if he'd turned a faucet on full blast. His sisters hated him – and it was all his fault. \"Max? What's wrong?\" Connie rubbed his arm assuringly. \"Claire and her stupid friends wrecked my igloo,\" he said. \"Oh, Max…\" \"I worked all day on it.\" Connie looked at him sympathetically. \"Her dumb friends almost killed me. Claire didn't help me. And neither did Bella.\" \"I would have helped,\" Connie said reassuringly. Max looked at the window. It had started to snow again. He hoped that Claire and her friends had driven into a snowy ditch and were stuck in the middle of nowhere. \"Where's my little songbird?\" Connie asked, referring to Bella. \"How was her day?\" Max thought for a moment. \"Cramped,\" he finally said. \"I'll bet. Not being able to go outside…but she did it to herself.\" Connie quickly asserted her decision before she changed her mind. \"She should think about what comes out of her mouth before she says anything.\" Max nodded, concealing the necklace from his mother's view. \"What's that?\" Connie asked. Busted. He showed her the necklace. \"Is that Bella's?\" He nodded. \"I stole it.\" He hadn't wanted to say that, but it had come out anyway. Connie's eyebrows came together. \"Max…that wasn't very nice.\" \"I was angry with her. But then she got angry with me for taking it. Then she said to keep it.\" Connie sighed. \"Max, you can't go around doing things like that to your sister. She's…going through a rough spot. And she doesn't need you worsening her situation.\" Max now wished that he could disappear off the face of the earth, never to bother anyone ever again. The world would be a lot better off without him ever existing. He was riddled with guilt, and now knew what needed to be done. He sat up and looked at his mother. \"Mom? I…I have something to show you…\" ... Connie walked on the carpet of Claire's room, which was now soaked with water. She started in horror at the waterlogged contents of her eldest daughter's room. \"What happened in here? Did you do this?\" Max nodded slowly, deciding his feet were more interesting than looking at Connie. \"Max…\" She shook her head. \"What have you done? What the hell were you thinking?\" \"I don't know,\" he mumbled. She walked past him and ran down the stairs. She came back up with towels. \"Come on,\" she said. \"We're going to clean this up.\" ... There was a knock at Bella's door. \"Come in,\" she called. \"Hey,\" Connie said quietly, walking in. She came over and sat on the edge of Bella's bed. She held up a sopping-wet towel. \"Max told me what happened today.\" Bella restrained herself from getting angry at the mention of her brother. \"How much?\" \"It started with a snow fort and ended with a missing dragon claw,\" Connie said wryly, but Bella could see the worry lines on her face. Bella rolled her eyes. \"I really don't wanna talk about it, Mom.\" \"That's fine, honey. Then I'll talk and you can listen.\" Bella had had a feeling that she'd say that. \"Bella, I would have been angry at first that you disobeyed your punishment, but I would have understood if you'd gone out to help your brother today.\" \"Oh, so now it's my fault?\" \"I didn't say it was. I'm just saying that if you had decided to stand up for him, I would have understood.\" \"So basically it's all my fault.\" \"Please stop being dramatic, Bella. I didn't say that.\" \"And I suppose Claire's getting off the hook as usual?\" \"Your sister does not get 'off the hook' with everything. I called her, and she's already been talked to about what she did.\" \"And what's the punishment?\" Connie paused. \"If you needed to know, I'd tell you. But you don't.\" Bella tried to keep her anger in check. \"She's let off with a warning, right?\" \"Bella—\" \"That seems fair that she can still go out this weekend and I have to stay put.\" \"Isabella! This is why I grounded you! This…saucy attitude has got to stop!\" Bella folded her arms. \"Now, I'd like you to please come and help Max and I mop up Claire's room.\" \"Why should I? I didn't do it.\" \"It'd be a big help.\" \"Why am I being punished for something he did?\" Connie handed her a clean towel. \"Please don't question me, Bella. Just come and help. And tomorrow, I would like you to apologize to Max for yelling at him.\" \"What about him? Shouldn't he apologize to me?\" \"I've talked to him, too, and he's doing the same thing tomorrow, as well as Claire. All three of you are going to stop acting like this and start being a family.\" \"Why do I have to apologize? I didn't do anything.\" \"Bella, please—\" \"Mom! Seriously! You come up with these stupid excuses as to why we need to be sorry for things!\" \"Stupid excuses? Bella, what about your attitude as of late?\" \"I haven't done anything wrong!\" Connie stood up. \"This conversation is over. Now come and help,\" she said coldly as she left the room.[Chapter 24] Thanks for everyone who's sticking with me! You guys rock! P.S.: I know I said that Bella is based off a good friend of mine whom I met last summer at theater camp. However, I will be making some references to Bella Swan just for kicks. ... Chapter Twenty-Two: Late Night Story She wasn't talking to him ever again. It was official now. While cleaning up the Witch's room, she'd declared it in her mind that she'd stop talking to Max. He was obviously not going to improve, and neither was she. It didn't do any good to try to contradict it. Along with this, she was also going to stop interfering with things. Her big mouth was a menace to her family, and got her into an enormous amount of trouble every day. All she had to do was stop meddling with everyone's business and she'd be home free. She'd figured it all out while she sat alone in her room, eating dinner. It was perfect, and it was foolproof. The question was would it work with the screwed-up relations she called family. Bella distracted herself from her harsh plan by trying to read the Twilight books, but it was no use. Stephanie Meyer's dark, seductive world couldn't suck her in at the moment. Besides, it was bad enough that some of the kids at school were calling her \"Vampire Girl\" and \"Edwina Cullen\". Despite that, she was relieved to find that there was school the next day, on account of the streets were now ploughed and there would be a rain storm that would wash a good portion of the snow away. Anything to get her out of this house. She needed it; they all did. ... Max snuck into Connie's office later that night. She was at her computer, talking on the phone with one of her co-workers. She looked tired, a sight that was often displayed on her face after a hard day at the office. So Max decided to cheer her up. He began his impression of the robot, making his limbs stiff and bumping into the wall, then into a cabinet. Connie began to laugh, amused by her son's dance. Max purposefully knocked once more into the cabinet and lay on the floor, suddenly exhausted. She hung up the phone and looked down at him as he played with the panty hose on her feet. \"Hey,\" she said quietly. \"Hi,\" he said. \"I could use a story.\" This was something they did together often. After a long day at work, Max would cheer her up with one of the many stories he would make up off the top of his head, and she'd type along. \"Once there were these really tall buildings…\" he began. \"And they could walk. There were also some vampires.\" Connie was now typing on a blank Word Processing page, following along with Max. \"The vampires lived in the buildings.\" It was coming clearer, faster now. \"The leader of the vampires was very pretty and very smart. Her name was…\" He sighed, not wanting to continue, but knowing he had to. \"Scratch what I said, Mom. About the vampire leader. Delete it.\" Bella the Vampire had gone into oblivion for quite some time – ever since those books about the vampires had come out. Bella had made it clear to everyone that she was not thrilled that she shared the same name as the main character, especially after the kids at her school began to make fun of her for it. Max, respecting her wishes, hadn't drawn a picture of his sister's alter ego in a long time. He'd tried to release her from the vault of his mind. She needed some air, he'd decided. But not tonight. \"The vampires wanted all the buildings to be made into vampires, too,\" Max continued. \"So they attacked. One of the vampires bit the tallest building. And…all his teeth fell out. Then he started to cry, because they wouldn't grow back.\" Connie seemed to get a worried look on her face, but continued to type. \"The other vampires asked him, 'What's wrong?'. He said, 'All my teeth fell out.' They said, 'Well, it's okay, because those were just your baby teeth.' And he said, 'No, those were my grownup teeth.' He couldn't do anything else without his teeth, so they left him. And he couldn't be friends with the buildings because the vampires had killed them all. The end.\" Connie pulled away from the keyboard and smiled sadly at him. He knew that it wasn't the most uplifting story he could think of, but he still felt hurt from what had happened earlier. But as Connie continued to smile at him, he felt his own face crack, and a small smile appeared. He somehow knew that everything was okay now. ... Trying to sleep with so much on her mind was difficult, so after tossing and turning for a while, Bella got out of bed and walked quietly down the hall to her mother's office to apologize for earlier. As she did, she heard Connie say, \"I could use a story.\" She froze in the doorway when she saw Max laying on the floor by Connie's computer desk. She backtracked a few inches and knelt by the wall, peeking in ever so slightly. Connie began to type as Max started a story. Bella couldn't help but smile. This was something Max and Connie loved to do together. She had always wanted to join in, but she didn't want to spoil something that was very special and didn't concern her. Connie looked worried now. Max's story wasn't going to be the stroll-in-the-park that their mother had envisioned, Bella decided. Max had stopped talking, and Bella guessed that his story was over now. Max and Connie smiled at each other, communicating in that special way that only a mother and son can understand. Even if she would never be a part of something like that, their smiling indicated that Connie was no longer mad about the incident. She'll still make us apologize, though, Bella reminded herself as she walked back down the hallway. And as she got into bed, she realized a horrible thought. Max and Connie may not have been mad about what had happened anymore, but as she finally fell asleep, she knew that she herself wasn't willing to let go of her bad feelings for Max just yet.[Chapter 25] Chapter Twenty-Three: Torn Inside The next morning, the breakfast table was absolutely silent. The only sounds were the crunch of cereal and clinking of silverware on plates and bowls. Connie cleared her throat. The three siblings looked at her, and she nodded her head. Claire sighed and turned to Max. \"Max, I'm sorry that my friends destroyed your snow thing yesterday. I'm also sorry that I didn't stop them and that I didn't help you.\" Bella noticed that her sister's voice was clipped and forced, like it usually was when she apologized and still thought she had done nothing wrong. Claire then turned to Bella. \"Bella, I'm sorry for threatening to rat you out to Mom. It wasn't right and it prevented you from helping Max.\" Connie seemed to approve, then looked at Bella expectantly. \"Claire, I'm sorry that I'm always so snappy with you. I should try to work on thinking before saying anything so I won't hurt anyone's feelings.\" She looked at Max, anger still burning at her insides. \"Max, I'm sorry I didn't help you when Claire's friends attacked. I should've known that Mom would have understood my actions.\" \"And?\" Connie prompted. \"And I'm sorry I yelled at you for stealing my dragon claw,\" she muttered. Connie once again smiled in approval. She finally turned to look at Max. \"Bella, I'm sorry that I got mad at you. And that I wrote the note. And that I took your dragon claw.\" He looked at the table the whole time, his face the image of shame. \"Claire, I'm sorry I ripped up your valentine,\" he went on. \"And that I made a mess in your room.\" Although the three of them looked completely aggravated by what had just taken place, Connie seemed satisfied. \"Now was that so hard to do?\" \"Yes,\" Claire answered automatically. \"Can I please go now? Dana's gonna be here any minute.\" \"Go ahead, Claire. Be safe. And remember: be home—\" \"—by ten tomorrow. Got it!\" Claire hastily got up from the table and ran to the front door. \"BYE!\" she yelled as the door slammed behind her. A moment later, the honk of a car horn sounded and the screech of tires could be heard on the street. \"Okay, kids, get ready,\" Connie said, getting up, as well. \"I'm taking both of you to school today.\" She walked out of the room, leaving Bella and Max alone. Bella didn't look directly at her brother. She stared at her now-empty plate, knowing that if she looked at him again, she wouldn't be able to control the anger she harbored for him. Maybe if I stay quiet, he'll leave me alone. \"Bella?\" Max piped up. Well, so much for that. \"What?\" Even though she wasn't talking to him, she couldn't be rude when he directly addressed her. Please don't say anything about the stupid necklace. I'll seriously kill you if you do. \"Are you mad?\" \"Mad about what?\" \"That I took your dragon claw?\" Dang it. \"Can we please not talk about it?\" Bella got up from the table, taking her dishes with her. She groaned inwardly when Max trailed behind her. \"But I don't wanna fight anymore,\" Max insisted. \"I'm really sorry about what I did.\" \"Well, sometimes—\" \"Sorry isn't enough,\" he finished, rolling his eyes. \"I know, I know. Like I haven't heard that from Mom.\" Shoot. He's not as ignorant as he looks. Bella loaded her dishes in the dishwasher. Not speaking to him was obviously not going to work, she could see. It was too difficult to ignore him. \"Let it go, Max. It's not worth it.\" Max got The Look on his face. Now she was really in deep water. \"Is there a reason why you hate me?\" \"Max, don't say that. I don't hate you.\" \"Then why are you so mean to me?\" Bella gave a frustrated sigh. \"I really don't wanna talk about this.\" \"Just like you never wanna talk about anything,\" Max mumbled. \"Okay, that's so not true…\" Bella said, knowing full well that it was. \"It is, too!\" She held up her hands. \"Let's just please not talk about it! So I'm still a bit angry with you! Big shocker! Everyone gets angry sometimes! It's not the end of the world!\" Max's eyes were huge. \"Oh…I didn't know you felt that strongly.\" Even though she knew they could never go back to the way things were, she could still see traces of her brother from when he was younger. She decided to focus on those remnants. \"Max, remember what I told you when you were little? About how people get angry and fight sometimes?\" Max nodded. \"It doesn't mean that we don't love each other just because we have one stupid fight.\" She smoothed his hair away from his face. \"I'm over it now, okay? I accept your apology. And…ditto with Claire.\" The ghost of a smile lingered on his face. \"Okay.\" He hugged her. \"Thanks, Bella.\" \"Anytime, Max.\" She stood in the kitchen and watched as he ran up the stairs to get ready, and stayed their long after he'd disappeared up the stairs. ... The ride to school wasn't nearly as pleasant as their encounter in the kitchen. Bella and Connie still had an unsettled disagreement going on, and the three of them knew it. It was visible on Max's face that he was relieved when he emerged from the car and ran into school. As soon as they pulled away, Connie dove right in. \"I'm glad you apologized this morning.\" Bella glanced at her. \"Oh. Cool.\" \"But I know you didn't really mean it.\" Well, thanks for stating the obvious. \"I know it's hard on you kids to be under the circumstances that we're in…\" Oh, no… \"Mom,\" Bella interrupted. \"This has nothing to do with that. Can we please not talk about it?\" Connie stared at her. \"You know, Bella, it'd be nice if you'd let other people talk once in a while.\" \"Since when has this conversation have anything to do with me and my talking habits?\" Bella asked incredulously. Connie sighed, frustrated. \"Never mind.\" She stopped in front of the school. \"Have a nice day.\" ... \"So,\" Tori said, sitting down. \"How was your snow day?\" Bella angrily stabbed at the watermelon on her lunch tray. \"Sucked,\" she said, the word dancing on her tongue. She felt the guilty pleasure of defying her mother. \"What happened?\" Bella looked up. \"I was stuck inside all day, because of Mom's great policy of 'Snow Days Count as the Weekend'. Max built an igloo, and then Claire had to go and let her friends ruin that. And I got blamed for it.\" \"Oh, my gosh! So, like, your mom thought you destroyed it?\" \"No. I stayed inside while they destroyed it. But she still thought that I should have gone out and helped, even though I wasn't allowed to go outside.\" \"Oh.\" Tori was silent for a moment before talking again. \"Oh. My. Gosh. So my mom took me shopping yesterday, and I got the cutest pair of Uggs!\" She stuck out her feet, proud of her suede boots. \"You would do that,\" Bella muttered angrily. \"Do what?\" \"You would change the subject to something other than what I'm talking about,\" Bella said. \"It's what you always do.\" Tori laughed nervously. \"Bella, come on…\" \"No, I'm not gonna 'come on'. You always have to change the subject so we're talking about you.\" Bella didn't know why she was telling her best friend her innermost thoughts, but it felt good to get the weight off her chest. \"I do not.\" Tori was beginning to get defensive. \"Yes, you do!\" \"Joey would never talk to me this way,\" Tori said huffily, talking about her boyfriend. \"And that, too! You're always talking about Joey or something stupid! Well, is Joey more important than me? Your best friend?\" Tori glared at Bella and said nothing. \"So, what did you do yesterday besides shop for overpriced footwear? Go on a date with Joey? Because he's so special that he'd break your heart how many times!\" Tori now had tears rolling down her face. \"What's with you, Bella?\" \"What do you mean, what's with me?\" Bella practically shouted, feeling the urge to speak her mind. \"What's with you ? You're the one who decides to go ahead and date some player without even consulting me—\" \"What's the big deal, anyway? Why do you care so much?\" \"I care about my best friend, that's why!\" Other students were beginning to notice that the two of them were in a fight. Tori tried to keep her voice down. \"Well, has it ever occurred to you that maybe you should care about what makes me happy instead of what makes you happy?\" she angrily whispered, more tears welling up in her eyes. \"My going out with Joey shouldn't concern you. It's my deal, and you should be happy for me!\" Bella angrily glared at her friend, not bothering to be quiet. \"Well, if you didn't pick such a bonehead to date, maybe I wouldn't be so opinionated.\" Tori was sobbing now. \"He's changed, okay? He promised me!\" Bella looked at her skeptically. \"Right. I'll believe that when pigs fly.\" \"If you'd just give him a chance, maybe you'd see that he has changed! I've been trying to tell you that all week, but all you've been doing is complaining about something!\" \"You have not!\" \"Yes, I have! You were too busy talking about something else to notice!\" The words brought memories of the past few days back, and Bella vaguely recalled that Tori had tried to mention something about Joey being a different person. But she'd been talking about other things: her mother's stupid boyfriend, her sister's obnoxious attitude, and her brother's rambunctious behavior. Realizing this brought a cold sensation over Bella. \"Tori…I'm sorry,\" she said, reaching across the table to her best friend. \"I had no idea…\" \"Well, of course not,\" Tori said coldly. \"How could you? I mean, you're so busy whining about your life…\" Bella jerked her hand back as if she'd just touched a burning stove. \"Tori, I…\" \"Have you ever stopped to consider who you are, Bella?\" This made no sense. \"What do you mean?\" Tori paused. \"If you don't know, then figure it out. It's not too hard.\" \"Tori, now's not the time to be all cryptic.\" \"I'm serious. Figure it out. It's not rocket science.\" She paused again, a serious look coming over her face. \"The Bella I know would have gone out and helped Max, punishment or not.\" Bella balled her hands into fists, hating to be wrong. \"I'm not talking to you anymore.\" She picked up her lunch tray, turned on her heels, and walked away, tears fighting their way down her flushed face.[Chapter 26] Chapter Twenty-Four: Hideaway Max was thankful that Claire had gone over to a friend's house to spend the night. He needed the car ride home to be silent; his thoughts were jumbled and he wanted to sort them out. Today had been a worrisome school day for Max. His teacher had told the class that the sun was going to die, and that the world was going to end. The words were still bouncing across his mind: \"The solar system will go dark…permanently.\" Something about those words sent a shudder of fear through the nine-year-old. He had enough problems to deal with without having to worry about the end of the world and the sun dying. There had to be some way that everything could go back to normal… \"Something wrong?\" Connie asked. Yeah…everything, Max almost answered, but before the words came out, he realized his mother wasn't talking to him. \"No. Everything's fine.\" Bella, sitting in the front seat, leaned her head against the window, looking out at the rain-soaked world. \"You're not texting Tori, like you usually do.\" Connie looked at her daughter in worry. \"Did you two have a fight?\" Bella nodded. \"I don't even know how it happened. We were talking, and then I started to say things I didn't want to say, and then we were yelling at each other…\" She sounded choked up, and had to stop recounting the events. \"Best friends fight sometimes,\" Connie said consolingly. \"It's part of a healthy relationship.\" \"She's not going to forgive me this time,\" Bella said. \"I told her things I'd never say to her face, but once I started…it was hard to stop.\" \"I told you…\" \"Mom.\" Bella held up her hand. \"Please.\" Connie turned back to the road, clearly concerned. It was probably a good idea to hold onto the news that the world was going to end, Max decided. ... He wasn't going to panic. Now was definitely not the time to do a silly thing like that. Instead, he'd take the more rational approach. He gathered as many blankets as he could and tried to recreate the fort that had rudely been destroyed the day before. It wasn't as sturdy, but he was sure it would withhold floods and storms and whatever else would be thrown his way. Inside was safe and warm. He wondered why his life couldn't feel this way. He didn't feel safe or warm anywhere anymore, or with anyone. Claire repelled him, Connie was always busy, Bella insisted on playing hide-and-seek with her emotions, and his dad was never around. As for Gary…Max couldn't even begin to fathom why he'd even consider his mother's numbskull boyfriend. But none of that mattered. He was all alone, and he needed someone to play with. Someone to talk to. Someone to save from the dying sun. \"Mom! Come up here! You gotta see this!\" he called down the stairs. \"Can it wait, Max? I'm busy!\" Of course. No surprise. \"Please, Mom? It's really cool!\" \"I'll see it after dinner, okay?\" She was probably watching TV with the idiot. How could she focus on canned audiences and her boyfriend at a time like this? It apparently wasn't very hard, because he heard the two of them laughing at something on the television. Fine. Let them laugh at people in that stupid box. Let the dumb thing save them when the world ended. He wouldn't feel sorry in the least. Claire wasn't home, so she was automatically off his list. That meant taht the last person in the house he could try was next door, locked up in her room, doing her homework and sulking about her argument with Tori. She loved his forts, and he knew she couldn't resist this one. He ran out in the hallway and knocked. \"Bella? You in there?\" No answer. She was humming to a tune on her iPod, most likely. \"Bella! Come on! I made a fort!\" The humming was louder, telling him that she was ignoring him on purpose. Max stormed back to his room, ready to scrap the whole idea. He'd tear down his fort since no one really cared, anyway. He needed something – anything – to do tonight, since the end of the world was no longer a major concern. His eyes fell on his wolf suit hanging on the back of his door. He'd grown into it, like his dad had predicted. It now fit him perfectly, and he wore it often to chase Stumpy around the house (if Stumpy wasn't hiding in the basement, which was his usual stakeout). He felt his face light up as he reached for the suit. It cured his loneliness, was there when no one else was. He needed some brightening up tonight, and as he slipped on his practically-a-friend, he was once again struck with an ingenious idea. ... Bella was thankful, for the first time in what seemed like years. It was after school, and she could be in the comfort of her bedroom for two-and-a-half days without virtually any interruptions. She held off on her homework at first and decided to read. It was difficult; her mind wandered back to how she and Tori were still arguing. Why had she said those things? She hadn't wanted to, but her emotions had seemed to take over her body, and out came thoughts she'd never dreamed she'd say to her best friend's face. After realizing reading wasn't going to stimulate her, she gave in and started on her homework. She easily got bored with this, but she didn't want to drag it out over the weekend, like she usually did. She plugged in her iPod headphones, knowing that her ears would be happy, at least. Through the music, she heard movement in the room next door. It was most likely Max, building something completely amazing— STOP. She turned back to her homework, sure that the intensity of her eyes would bore a hole into her Spanish textbook. She wasn't going to bother sparing thoughts for her brother. She was done messing with her family, done being grounded. Done with upsetting a lifestyle that was obviously being corrupted by her presence. A little while later, she heard him calling to their mother to come upstairs. Judging from the headlights that had spilled into her room an hour before, Gary was over, and Connie was too busy spending time with him to pay attention to Max. Sure enough, a knock on her door came a few seconds later. \"Bella?\" Max called quietly. Don't bother… she told herself. It's so not worth it. He wasn't going away. \"Bella! I made a fort! You gotta come see it!\" She turned the music louder, drowning him out. She didn't hear anything after that, so she figured he'd gone back to his room. Her stomach growled. Dinner was going to be soon, but she couldn't wait until then, she knew. \"Shut up, stomach,\" she said. It rumbled again. There was no use resisting. \"Fine,\" she conceded. \"I'll go get some fruit.\" ... She walked down the stairs and peaked at the living room. Connie and Gary were drinking wine and being gushy with each other. Bella expected her eyes to explode and her lunch – what she'd eaten of it – to be making a trip back up her throat at any time. But as she observed them longer, Bella found her disgust ebbing away. Connie was smiling and laughing, and she looked like she was having fun. She was…happy. And all because of Gary. No matter how much she hated him, Bella wouldn't deny that Gary made her mother happy. That was what really mattered…right? Bella shook the thought from her head as she tore through the fridge. She found an apple ( How ironic is that? ) and hungrily bit down. \"Psst! Bella!\" Bella turned from the fridge, apple still in her mouth, and saw Max in his wolf suit, looking up at her with his big brown eyes. Surprised that she was still somewhat mad at him, she wanted to make this encounter quick. \"What, Max?\" she asked, shutting the fridge door and setting the apple on the counter. \"I need your help,\" he pleaded. He pointed around the corner. \"I'm gonna try to get rid of him.\" Bella frowned at him. \"You're not serious.\" Max blinked a few times. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" Bella looked from side to side. \"Max, this isn't a good idea. I wouldn't do it if I were you.\" He looked dejected. \"Didn't you tell me that I should go after the things I want?\" he asked, referring to a phrase she'd told him when they were younger. She knelt down to his level. \"This isn't what I meant. You…\" She sighed. \"It's different, okay? This isn't some sort of game of yours. It's Mom's life.\" He shook his head. \"What happened to the two of us being on the same team when it came to him? You know how much of an idiot he is. We have to save Mom. Please.\" He looked her in the eyes. \"Can't you do this for me? I'm you're brother. 'You jump, I jump', remember?\" Bella hated it when he did this. He knew Titanic was her weak spot. But she wouldn't back down that easily. \"Max…I can't get involved in something like this. I'm in enough trouble as it is. I'm not gonna give Mom more reason to punish me.\" She hadn't meant to let anyone on to her plan, but it had come out. She stood up, and the two of them peeked around the corner once more. Connie and Gary were telling each other how cute the other one was. While Bella was secretly enjoying what she saw, she noticed Max wasn't as jubilent. He looked upset, and she quickly turned him around to speak to him. \"You saw them in there,\" she said. \"I was wrong about him, okay? Mom looks really happy. This is the first time I've seen her look genuinely happy in a long time.\" Max folded his arms in defiance. She knew he wasn't going to be persuaded that easily. But she didn't have the energy to tell him otherwise. \"Okay, fine. Go ahead and do whatever. Be a wild thing or a wolf or whatever you had planned.\" She grabbed the apple and walked away. \"Just know that I'm not supporting it.\"[Chapter 27] Hey! I don't know if I did well with this chapter...I tried to do a trick I've seen in books where the author frequently switches viewpoints. I don't know if it'll be confusing or not...so sorry if it is! Oh, and this chapter is like the definition of angst. Just thought I'd warn you. Enjoy! ... Chapter Twenty-Five: Capsized Max felt his feet stick to the kitchen floor as he listened to his sister's feet on the stairs and her bedroom door close. He gritted his teeth and emitted a low growl – a sound that contained all of his emotions: pain, anger, and frustration. It was the only thing he had left to mask his broken heart. He glanced around the corner. His mother and Gary were still displaying their affectionate gestures, and Max felt his stomach churn. There was always someone else in his mother's life – someone that wasn't him. Her own son, unimportant. \"Hey, Maxie,\" she said as she walked past, ruffling his wolf ears. He didn't even look at her; his anger was festering, boiling like a vat of hot poison within him. \"Bella! Come get your CDs off the table!\" Connie called, forgetting, once again, that Max was there. ... Max was reminded why he was doing this as he followed his mother into the kitchen. He wanted everyone in the house to know he existed. He was through being the good little boy who did what his parents told him and never uttered a word to anybody. He was a crazy wolf, and could eat them all if he chose to do so. \"Mom, what is that?\" Max asked, pointing to something on the stove that looked like beige cheese. \"It's pate,\" Connie answered. Max wrinkled his nose and climbed onto a chair. \"Gross.\" \"When you have your own house and can provide for yourself, you can have whatever you want,\" she answered, her back turned to him. She didn't say this in her normal joking voice. She sounded tired, annoyed. \"Max, can you please tell your sister to get her stuff off the table?\" Max narrowed his eyes. He turned around and mustered all the sound he could. \"BELLA! MOM SAYS TO GET YOUR STUFF OFF THE TABLE!\" \"I could have done that.\" Connie frowned at him. \"Don't yell.\" Upstairs, Bella reluctantly slammed her textbook shut. Couldn't she get some peace and quiet for once? Didn't her family see that she was trying to stay out of the way? She got up from the bed and walked down the stairs, not wanting to face them, knowing that if she did, something would slip and she'd be faced with more punishment. \"Why, hello, Isabella,\" Gary said from the living room. \"Hey,\" Bella answered passively. She didn't look at him, having the sudden urge to dump water on his head. Upon arriving in the kitchen, she noticed her mother was making dinner. Max, still clad in his wolf suit, was kneeling on a chair by the island, looking disdainfully at the food that lay there. \"Why do we have to have frozen corn? What's wrong with real corn?\" Max was complaining about dinner, something he often did. \"Frozen corn is real,\" Connie answered absently, working on something that was on the stove. She turned around. \"Bella! Get down here NOW!\" \"Chill, Mom, I'm right here,\" Bella said, an edge in her voice. Max tore his gaze away from the corn to glare at his sister. Go away. No one wants you. He wished he had telepathy, or some sort of mind power to will Bella to go back upstairs. \"Go get your stuff off the table, dear,\" Connie said. Go on… Bella urged herself. Get your dumb CDs off the table and leave…don't bother with these people… Get your stuff and leave, Max thought. No one likes you. Just go. \"Fine,\" Bella said, leaning against a cabinet. \"I'll do it in a minute.\" She had just gotten there, and even though she wanted to get back to her room as soon as possible, part of her couldn't resist the urge to watch how well her mother was handling her little wild thing. \"No, you'll do it now ,\" Connie said. Bella didn't move. Max turned away from them and looked at the island. What if he…? While Connie and Bella were having their conversation, Bella noticed out of the corner of her eye that Max was now towering over them. Oh, no… \"Max, get off the counter,\" Connie commanded. He stared down at the two of them and he growled deeply, sounding like an animal. Don't come any closer. I'll tear off your heads. \"Bella, please get your belongings off the table,\" Connie said, her gaze on Max. Bella went to the dining room table and gathered some of her CDs in a pile. She started for the stairs when things started getting out of hand. \"Woman!\" Max demanded of Connie. \"Feed me!\" He loved that he sounded so powerful. \"What the hell, Max?\" Bella said without thinking as she passed. It wasn't like him to say things like that. \"Isabella Kaye!\" Connie averted her eyes to her middle child. \"Sorry…it slipped.\" Bella set her CDs at the foot of the stairs before standing next to her mother. \"It'd better not slip again. As for you, Max,\" Connie said, \"I told you to get off the damn counter.\" Bella almost pointed out that her mother had used profanity right after she had, but decided against it. Remember…no interfering… \"Never!\" Max declared. He wasn't going to obey someone as inferior as Connie. He no longer listened to her. \"Bella, tell him to get off the island, please,\" Connie pleaded. \"He obviously won't listen to me.\" Bella now stared up at her brother, looking into his brown eyes. They were no longer filled with the innocence and kindness they once had. Instead, they burned with pain, anger, and frustration. You can't tell me what to do, Max thought. You're too weak. No interfering, Bella… She shook her head. \"I can't do this.\" She walked towards the stairs. Ha! Max smiled smugly to himself, proud that she could be turned away so easily. \"Bella!\" Connie had a disbelieving look on her face. \"Mom, this isn't my fight. I can't get involved.\" \"Go help your mother,\" Gary said, still watching TV in the living room. Bella was surprised to hear his voice so…firm. She approached him, an incredulous look crossing her face. \"Excuse me?\" \"Go help her control him.\" \"And who are you to walk into my house and boss me around?\" Bella put her hands on her hips. She wondered what had suddenly compelled him to sound like someone his own age. \"I'll give you to the count of three to GET DOWN FROM THERE,\" Connie shouted. \"One…two…\" \"I refuse to eat frozen corn!\" Max shouted back. He was really getting angry now. \"Max, get down! Bella, just come and help!\" Connie called from the kitchen. \"I'll eat you up!\" roared Max. \"You heard your mother,\" Gary urged Bella. \"Go help her with the little monster.\" \"I don't have to listen to you,\" Bella told him. \"You're not my father.\" Gary snorted. \"Yet.\" That did it. Bella's temper had reached its breaking point, and there was no telling what she'd do now. The thought of water crossed her mind again. She looked around the living room, seething mad. Her eyes fell on an open wine bottle. How do you like them apples, Gary? Before she knew what she was doing, wine was staining the couch violet red and Gary was trying to get the liquid out of his hair and off of his clothes. \"Look what you did!\" he cried. Connie came in, leaving Max in the kitchen. \"Isabella Kaye Carson!\" she screamed. So much for not interfering… \"You are sixteen years old , not five! What were you thinking, young lady?\" Bella gave her mother an ugly glare, tears streaking down her cheeks. She didn't even care that it had felt good to dump wine on Gary. All she cared about was that Connie would side with Gary and that she'd be grounded for the rest of her life. You have to control yourself… \"Like you care!\" Bella shouted. Before she could say anything more, Max suddenly appeared, howling like a wolf and running around insanely. They were ignoring him again, and he wasn't going to have any of it. \"ARRROOOOOOO!\" he howled. Connie started to chase him, leaving the other two in the living room. She caught him in the entryway and grabbed ahold of his arm. \"You need to calm down!\" she fiercely told Max. Gary pushed past Bella, going out into the entryway, as well. Bella saw this as her chance to sneak away before she made things worse for everyone. Max wriggled and twisted in his mother's grip, but she wasn't letting go. Gary looked upon him with disapproving eyes, which only made him squirm harder. Before disappearing, Bella looked one last time at Max. His eyes hadn't changed as he screamed at the top of his lungs, clearly unhappy. He was still a wild thing. But somehow…he wasn't hers any longer. \"You're an out of control wild thing.\" She knew it was something Connie would say, but it was all she could come up with. \"You're not mine anymore.\" She ran quietly up the stairs, slamming her door as she heard her mother yelp and Max emit sob after sob. Gary said something about Max's behavior, but Bella didn't want another reason to go back down and confront them. She threw her school things on the floor and flopped on the bed, hating the world and wanting her family to disappear. ... Bella's words hit him with an intensity he couldn't take in. His anger boiled over him, and he focused all his energy onto Connie. His head went towards her and he bit down on Connie's arm – hard. She yelped and pulled away. \"MAX!\" she screamed. He hadn't wanted to do that. He'd just done it without thinking. Knowing he'd done something to hurt her made him start to cry. \"What happened?\" Gary asked, even though he'd been standing right there. \"He bit me!\" \"You shouldn't let him treat you that way!\" he said lamely. The two of them were talking at once now. Max cried harder. \"You're out of control!\" Connie said. Hearing this was the last straw. Max, putting all his trust in his emotions, turned around and bolted out the door, running out into the night.[Chapter 28] Last chapter of the year! (Get it? Since it's the last day of 2009...) Happy New Year! ... Chapter Twenty-Six: Think Like Max This is so boring, Bella thought as she kept rereading the same sentence in her Economics book. Trying to do homework when she was this upset wasn't the best way to get things done. She shook her head. Was Max mental or something? She still couldn't believe he jumped up on the island and growled at her and Connie. She was being sarcastic when she had mentioned a wild thing; she hadn't been serious. Then again, she shouldn't have been complaining. Dousing Gary with wine wasn't a very wise thing to do, even if he was a jerk. And now that she knew that not interfering with things wasn't the way to go, she felt lost and confused about what to do about her big temper and even bigger mouth. It's been ten minutes. Maybe I should check if Mom's tamed the beast. She shut her textbook and started to walk downstairs. \"It's so late out…\" she heard Connie say. \"How are we going to find him?\" Bella stopped mid-step. She suddenly had a bad feeling in her stomach. \"I'm sure he hasn't gone too far,\" Gary said to Connie. \"He seemed so upset after he bit me…he could be anywhere by now!\" \"Maybe he just needs some time to think about things. But if it'll make you feel better, I'll go start up my car and go look for him.\" He paused. \"Should we tell Claire and Isabella—\" \"No,\" Connie interrupted. \"Don't tell them. Claire's at a friend's tonight, and she doesn't need a reason to worry and drive home this late. And as for Bella…she may be angry with everyone, but if she hears about this, she'll be heartbroken.\" She sighed. \"Just please find him. I'd rather they never find out about this.\" Bella sat down on the stairs, staring numbly at the wall. She really couldn't believe this. All anger that had been in her ebbed away, making room for panic. Max was gone? But when? How? Why? She remembered hearing something downstairs a few minutes before…her mother yelping, Max crying, and Gary saying things no one really cared about. After that, Bella had made so much noise sobbing herself, it was impossible to hear anything. And after calming down, she had tried to do her homework to forget about things. The yelp she had heard from Connie must have been from Max biting her. Gary had probably said something stupid, like how Max was acting wild and Connie was in the right. And Max was so upset with everyone, his actions finally sank into his brain, causing him to cry. Then he…ran away. She slowly made her way back to her room. But instead of going there, she took a detour through Max's room. As her fingers passed over his possessions, she recalled an old saying she'd heard once. You don't realize what you have until it's gone. She'd lost so many people in her life: her dad, her sister, her mother, her best friend…and now Max. Blankets covered her younger brother's bed. She carefully climbed through the opening and sat for a moment. This was what he'd been trying to show her. She was so occupied with being selfish and dramatic and carrying out her stupid plan that she'd completely neglected him. How many times had instances like this happened? Ten? Fifteen? Eighty-four? She'd lost count, but knew that the tally was much too high. Max's stuffed animals watched her with disdain, recognizing her as one of the perpetrators who'd driven their owner away. She allowed them to study her; she wasn't focused on them. She was soaking up the remains of her brother, the ghost of his shadow still lingering in the abandoned fort. How she wished he were there at that moment...to show her this great work of his...to hear how sorry she was for all she'd done... The plastic eyes became too much. She exited and walked back to her room. She sat at the window seat, staring up at the full moon, trying to wrap her head around everything. Max was gone. He was outside. At night. Alone. With who-knows-what prowling around, looking for innocent kids like him to… Bella shook her head. She couldn't think like that. She needed to be positive. Everything would be fine. Gary would get in his car and find Max, and then bring him home. Then everything would go back to normal. But Gary, no matter how many times he would deny it, hardly even knew Max. He didn't know how to think like a nine-year-old, or where his favorite places around the neighborhood were. Gary would be out there all night, driving around in circles, not making any progress. Gary didn't know Max…like she did. Bella looked around her room and made up her mind. If Max was going to be found soon…she'd have to find him herself. ... She packed her warm jacket, mittens and a scarf, ear muffs, a bag of fish crackers, two bottles of water, her cell phone, her iPod, pepper spray, and a flashlight. She luckily had her knitted boots in her room so she wouldn't have to go downstairs and draw attention to herself. She was ready. The hard part now was getting outside. Bella had never snuck out before. Sure, she had thought about it once or twice in her life, but she had been brought up to know that it was a very risky thing to do. But she also grew up learning that family was important, and that outweighed the dangers of sneaking out. She opened the window that lead out to the roof. She leaned out as far as she could and dropped the backpack. It fell to the ground, hardly making a sound. If she had been looking up at her window now, Bella would have thought that the drop wasn't too bad. But now that she was about to jump, she realized that it was much higher than she had previously assumed. She sat on the window, trying to urge herself off. She was once again afraid of being clumsy and making noise. Connie and Gary would surely then discover her and bring her back inside and tell her to be a good girl and wait until Gary brought Max home. Max. She had to do it for Max. Bella closed her eyes and jumped. She immediately knew closing her eyes was a bad idea. Although the drop wasn't bad, she hadn't landed on her feet. Instead, she'd inelegantly caught her foot in the gutter, scraped her hands on the pavement, and fell on her backside. Silence came from the house, followed by footsteps fast approaching the front door. Bella grabbed her backpack and ran to the tree, trying to conceal herself. She heard the front door open, then close a few seconds later. She peeked around and saw that no one had come out. Letting out a sigh of relief she quickly ran to the end of the street and stood by the streetlight. Catching her breath, she looked out into the night. There were other streetlights scattered here and there, and some homes had their outside lights on. But even this wasn't enough to comfort her. Bella had always been scared of the dark, especially the streets at night. She had long ago abandoned all thoughts that a serial killer with a hockey mask and a chainsaw was lurking in her closet, but after being informed by the evening news that gangs hung out on dark streets, she refused to sleep without a nightlight. Bella hugged the streetlight. She couldn't go out into the blackness. It would swallow her up and she'd never come out again. Someone or something was creeping around, watching her every move, waiting for the right moment to pounce. What if that happened to Max? The thought struck her like a wrecking ball, and her legs felt numb. If that ever happened to Max…she didn't know what she'd do. She'd been so horrible to him over the past few months. They all had been, really. All his feelings had been bottled up, and because they never really talked things over, he'd finally been shaken and had exploded. She felt bad that she'd made Max feel this way. And that was why she needed to find him. To set things right not just for her, but for everyone. She cautiously took one step, and then another, making her way into a world unknown.[Chapter 29] Chapter Twenty-Seven: Hitting The Streets Max awoke to the rosy light of dawn on the horizon. He sighed, knowing that today would be like its many predecessors. After bolting out the door, he'd bolted into the forest and found a boat at the shore of the lake. He got in and sailed away with a second thought about it. He'd been sailing for days, weeks, months even, he was sure. He stared at the endless stretch of ocean as he carved his name into the side of the boat with a loose nail. The never-ending hours of being in that tiny boat were getting to be unbearable. He'd tried to keep himself entertained, but it was difficult. His mind always wandered back to what had happened that night when he'd gone insane: his mother's horrified face; Gary's awkward words; and Bella's cruel actions. Claire hadn't even been there, but just the basic memory of her had been looming over the house. They all hated him, and he was glad that they wouldn't have to be bothered with him anymore. Max started to hum impulsively. It was slow and sad, yet had power and beauty. He couldn't remember where he'd heard it before; maybe someone had taught it to him a long time ago… It reminded him of when Bella had taught him to fly. That day had been amazing; it was when he knew that his friendship with his older sister was real, and that she was going to be a loyal friend to him. Even though it'd been a while ago, he felt as if it had just happened recently. Max shrugged to himself. He didn't have much else to do. And no one would be watching him, waiting for him to fail, as there always seemed to be. So he stood up, went to the bow of the boat, spread out his arms and closed his eyes. When he opened them, adrenaline rushed to the pit of his stomach. The wind blew past him, spraying him with salt. His head went back and he let the sun warm his face, feeling free. She was right , he thought grudgingly. This still feels amazing . He stood for a moment longer, reveling in the freeness he felt. When he opened his eyes, he saw something that was like drinking cold water on a hot day: land. He turned his boat towards the speck on the horizon, hopeful for the first time since he'd embarked on his journey. ... My Weird, Crazy Dream – Part III As told in 1 st Person by Bella Carson Despite the fact that what Max just said makes me feel like I've been hit in the stomach with a huge kickball, I ignore his remark about me hating him. I focus on making myself known to the creatures...monsters...whatever they are. \"You're a vampire?\" asks the one that looks like a rooster. \"Uh…I guess.\" Even as I speak, I can feel two sharp teeth in my mouth. Fangs. \"You feed on humans or animals?\" the one with the horn on her nose asks. Her voice is sharp; I can tell that if I answer wrong, things won't be good. \"Um…both?\" I take a stab at it, not knowing what to say. Max scoffs. \"Yeah. She hunts all the time. She's a vicious, bloodthirsty killer!\" The beasts all stare at me for a minute before going up in roars and chatter. It sounds like they think I'm pretty cool. \"Wow, Max!\" the striped one says. \"You're sister's amazing!\" Max glares at me, folding his arms and shaking his head. \"We should introduce ourselves. I'm Carol,\" the striped one tells me. \"I'm Douglas,\" the rooster says, sticking out his…paw (?) for me to shake. \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" \"I'm Ira,\" a big, bulky gray one says. \"I put holes in the trees. This is Judith.\" \"Hey,\" the one with the horn says casually. \"I'm sort of a downer, so don't get offended if I say something rude.\" \"I-I'm Alexander,\" says the small goat thing. He's shaking like crazy, like he's cold or something. The one with human feet and the face of a bull grunts. \"That's…that's the Bull,\" Carol introduces. \"He doesn't say much.\" Obviously , I think to myself. I mean, all he does is makes noises. \"I'm KW,\" says the last one. She has red hair and kind eyes. Her nose looks a lot like Carol's. I can tell she's a very gentle creature. Max steps in front of me. \"Okay. Now we've all met. Can she please leave now?\" \"What's the big rush?\" Carol asks. \"Yeah, what's the deal, King?\" Judith inquires. \"She's your sister. She's just as powerful as you…right?\" Max slumps his shoulders in defeat. \"Yeah. Whatever.\" The beasts – wild things, I guess is more accurate – go up in cheers again. They raise Max on their shoulders and I try to keep up. \"This is gonna be great!\" Carol says, clearly excited. \"We've got a king, and we've got a vampire. Now things are gonna be okay.\" ... He wasn't at the playground. But even she had seen that coming. All the same, Bella looked everywhere on the premises: the jungle gym tubes, the slides, the forest bordering one side. She grabbed her backpack and headed off to the next place – whatever that place may be. She didn't get it. He wasn't on the bench on the corner of Cypress St. with the ING logo; he hadn't been in any of the neighbors' yards (or houses, for that matter; she'd been extra sneaky in peeking in the windows); and he definitely wasn't staked out under any of the parked cars lined up along the curb. She wanted to go back and check in her tree house, but her instincts told her that Max wasn't hiding there. Where could he be? She was beginning to worry. It'd been a half hour, and she was sure she'd have found him by now. What if he really was kidnapped? Or worse? Something kept nagging at the very back corner of her brain. It persisted in telling her that Max wouldn't be anywhere she looked. He was no longer in this world… She stopped herself. He wasn't dead. She was sure of that. He was a strong kid. They'd taken a karate class for a while, and he'd been a fast learner. He was probably doing a lot better than she was right now. Bella remembered her weird dream that she kept having. Something about it just seemed so real…all those wild things…and her brother being upset with her… Max is with the friendly wild things, she thought as she went off down the street. They'll take care of each other…wherever they are…[Chapter 30] Hey, y'all! Agh, I'm sorry it's taking me so long to update! I'm back at school, and finals/really difficult math tests are creeping up on me pretty soon. And school always comes first...with the exception of family. Anyway, with that plus extra carriculars AND a bunch of other stuff, I'll probably hold off on posting in a couple weeks. Oh...and the scene with KW and Max...I got the dialogue from a YouTube video (it was a scene from the movie). I can't remember who posted it, but thanks whoever did! ... Chapter Twenty-Eight: Unexpected Strength Max waited…and waited…and waited. Sleep just wasn't in his system at the moment. He felt buzzed and energized, as if he'd just consumed a gallon of Mountain Dew. He was in the middle of a pile – a huge, furry pile. These were his new subjects, creatures that he identified as wild things. He'd live with them, and they'd play nicely (and wildly). But most of all, they'd care for each other, like friends were supposed to. Max recalled the memories of the past few hours in his head. He'd arrived on the shore of the island at sundown, tying his boat to some nearby rocks. He'd then scaled a dangerously tall cliff, following a trickle of smoke that was hanging in the air. It had led him to a clearing, where various fires were burning and the wild things had been. They appeared to be smashing nest-like structures, and Max, the wild thing in him coming forth, had rushed forward and joined in. The biggest one, a striped beast named Carol, had enjoyed his enthusiasm. The others, however, were much less forgiving. They told Max that the nests were their homes, and because he'd ruined them, it made him fit to be eaten. Max, in a moment of genius, prevented the wild things from eating him. He'd bluffed about being a king from another land with magic powers, and that he was strong enough to keep the group together. The beasts had been impressed, and crowned him king. After that, everything had been fast-paced. Max had declared a wild rumpus, and that's exactly what had happened. They howled, they ran, they smashed into trees; the beasts had executed anything Max commanded of them. It was exhilarating, but it was tiresome. Which was why they were now in a pile, resting. It hadn't been comfortable at first, though. Max was at the bottom, a canopy of fur overhead. That, and his foot was painfully stuck under someone's leg, causing his toes to fall asleep. He'd tried to pull it free, but it was useless. These beasts outweighed him by tons. \"Need help there?\" Max turned his head to see one of the creatures watching him. It was KW, the wild thing with the soft eyes and the iron-straight red hair. There was a quality of secrecy about her. He didn't know much about this creature, but she seemed kind, willing to listen. \"Yeah,\" Max said, answering her question. \"My foot's stuck.\" \"I see that. Hang on.\" She effortlessly pushed the leg off. \"There you go.\" Max smiled as his foot woke up. \"Thanks.\" He was still in awe at the beasts' strength. \"I'm KW,\" she said. \"I'm Max,\" Max said. \"So, what's your story?\" she asked him. \"Why'd you come here?\" Max had to think for a second. Telling KW about why he was really here would seem too…boring. Like she really wanted to hear about that. \"Well…\" Max said, thinking on his feet. \"Well, I'm an explorer, and I travel a lot.\" \"Mmm.\" She seemed to be buying it. \"And…I travel by sea.\" \"Right…\" \"I used to travel by air.\" \"So obviously you have no home or family,\" KW concluded. It always came back to that. Max saw no way around talking about it. He wondered if his family was missing him…he'd been away for so long. He sighed. \"I have one of those, but…\" Max trailed off, remembering what had happened that fateful night. \"But you ate them all?\" KW supplied when Max didn't talk for a few seconds. \"No!\" Max was startled. \"No, I just bit one of them is all, and…I went crazy.\" After a long pause, he added, \"I don't like frozen corn.\" Maybe he could have been a bit more…understanding. Maybe he could've turned it down a notch and not been so…wild. Connie would've appreciated that a lot more, obviously. And, as much as he hated to admit it, acting civilized could have saved Gary from looking so out of place. And Bella would have— Bella. He had forgotten about her. She was probably still in her room, not even knowing – not even caring – that he was gone. \"And…living with a vampire for a sister's a bit of a challenge,\" he finished. KW looked sad. \"Oh. I'm sorry if that's the way you lived.\" But it's partly my fault…I acted horribly… \"I act like I'm a bad person,\" he said, thinking out loud, his face matching his depressed state of mind. \"Are you?\" \"I don't know.\" Bella's harsh words were still plaguing his mind. Go ahead and be a wild thing…you're not mine anymore… \"I don't know.\" \"Well… I'm glad you came,\" KW said, smiling. \"It'll be good to have someone around here who doesn't eat everybody.\" I'm guessing that happens a lot, then… Max thought, a smile of his own tugging at his mouth. \"I mean, you just bite everyone. But biters aren't so bad. Eaters are the ones I just can't stand.\" \"I have no plans to eat anybody,\" Max assured her. \"All right, good,\" KW giggled. \"Good night.\" ... Max had wormed his way through the heap until he was at an opening. He stuck his head out so he could breathe, and so he could gather his thoughts. And here he was, reliving events he was sure he'd never forget. This is the best day ever, he thought as he finally drifted off to sleep. ... Bella sat on a street corner bench, trying to think of her next move. So far the temperature had continued to grow colder, and Bella felt as if her face was frozen. But she wasn't going home, no matter how cold it got. It was going to take a lot more than sub-zero temperatures to make her head back home. She was going to find Max…wherever he was. Headlights were visible from the next street over. That's weird, she thought, her brow furrowing. Who was out here this late at night? No one in their right mind would be outside in this weather. Keeping this in mind, she went to investigate. There was a car parked along the side of the road, the driver's door open. The streetlights were off on that street, and although the headlights lit up the front of the car, it was hard to make out the rest of it. But by the full moon, she could see the silhouette of a person near the vehicle. That's got to be the driver. A sick feeling came over her, and she had the desire to get out of there. Gripping her backpack straps tighter, she turned to walk away. \"Hey!\" The person had called to her. It wasn't a voice she recognized. It sounded agitated. She picked up her pace. \"Hey!\" It was a man. Oh, God. She felt a pressure on her arm. She turned and saw, from the light of the moon, that there were fingers enclosed around it. She refused to look at the face of this guy; she knew that if she did, she'd have nightmares about it for the rest of her life. Think, Bella! DO SOMETHING! \"You're not getting away that easily,\" the man said. She panicked, but in that moment of terror, she found her solution. Her foot moved by itself, somehow, and connected with the man's shin. He let go to hold his leg, and she was off. Run, Bella. Just run. He must have recovered faster than she'd thought he would, because there he was, grasping her arm again. She kicked him, but she was too slow this time in her getaway. From the ground, he held onto her foot, and down she went onto the pavement. Out of her backpack came the fish crackers, a bottle of water, the flashlight, and the pepper spray. \"You're too slow, little Philly,\" the man said, trying to catch his breath. Seriously? She grabbed the nearest thing to her, which happened to be the pepper spray. She aimed the nozzle in his face and pressed the button. He let go in a second. She quickly gathered the scattered items and put them back in her backpack before running for her life. She could hear him cursing as she rounded the corner. She didn't slow down, because she knew that he'd be following her. And she was right. She saw the lights illuminating the path before her. Faster. You have to go faster. And faster she went. She easily hid in the shadows of a dark street, and to her relief, the car roared past. But she still didn't feel safe. She took out her flashlight and sprinted down the street, distancing herself as far as she could from the assaulter. And even when she knew he was probably gone, she didn't stop. The stakes had just been raised, and now she was more determined than ever to find her younger brother. What she didn't know was that her troubles that night were far from over.[Chapter 31] Hey, everyone! OMG I have some bad news. My computer has yet another virus (this being the third time)! My mom's taking it in, but I don't know when I'll be able to post anything. I'm typing this from a school laptop, and if anyone finds out I posted this from school property, I'm in HUGE trouble (cuz we're supposed to be working on a Spanish project LOL). I hope to get some computer access this weekend somewhere, and if I don't post for a while, you now know why. I feel so bad that I can't do anything, but please know that I'll do whatever I can to update. Thanks for everyone who's reviewing! You guys are amazing! And I promise I'll try to update soon! ~Elphie[Chapter 32] Hey! I'm at the library, getting computer access! And I may get some more this weekend! WHOO! So, anyway, since I haven't typed in a while, I made sure to make this one long! Enjoy! ... Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Search Continues Geez! You'd think they'd put some salt out here! Bella thought as she slipped, once again, on a patch of ice. The rain that had fallen earlier had melted most of the snow, but it had also left ice all over the place. The neighborhood where she was currently located had been hit pretty hard, and every few steps she found herself sliding and trying to keep her balance. Well, better that than being persued by Crazy Guy. She'd run into him twice already after their first encounter. She'd made sure she was hidden, though; as far as he knew, she was safe at home, never again to walk the streets at night. She was determined not to have another episode with him. To keep her mind from the chilling thought, she forced her thoughts onto other, more important matters: Max... I feel bad about...X Things just happen sometimes, and...X I just wanna say that...X UGH! Bella kicked a nearby snowbank, and once again found herself struggling to stay on both of her feet. She hadn't expected that making up a speech would be this hard. When she found Max - if she found him - she planned to apologize profusely. First she'd express how happy she was to see him; then she'd get into the wrongdoings she was sorry for; and finally, she'd sit back and pray that Max would forgive her. Would he want to, though? His attitude lately clearly explained that he wasn't thrilled to be her brother. Maybe, when she found him, he would refuse to return home with her. Maybe he'd found someplace better to call home. She felt pained at the thought, but figured that anyplace was better than their home life...at least, until everything got straightened out. I wish I could be wherever you are right now, Max...it'd be a huge improvment from this... She shivered, trudging along the slush-covered and ice-lined sidewalk. She suddenly had a strange feeling. It felt as if she knew what Max was up to at that moment. He was...putting his creative mind to work. He was going to build something...perhaps a fort of sorts. That wouldn't end well. Based on the past two days, forts didn't exactly go hand-in-hand with Max. Both attempts had ended in failure. She hoped this potential third wouldn't end the same. Goodness, Max...you'd better not get yourself into too much trouble...I don't know what I'd do if that happened... ... My Weird, Crazy Dream - Part IV As told in 1st Person by Bella Carson The wild things, Max and I rumpus for a while, then fall asleep in a huge pile. Only dream sleep lasts for, like, two seconds in my dreams. So one minute, I'm sleeping, and the next, the wild thing called KW is shaking me awake. We walk through the woods to the part of the island with rocks and stuff like that. In the middle of it all is a huge fort - a structure that the eight of them have built. It's phenomenal. The outside looks like a giant bird's nest, with thousands of sticks and twigs woven together. There's a tall, cresent-moon structure near the fort that serves as a look-out post. The inside of the main building is roomy and spacious, with underground tunnels running under the front room. A door on the right side of the room catches my eye. It looks small and secretive - definitely an invention of Max's. \"What's that?\" I ask. This is obviously not a topic the wild things like to discuss. They grow uneasy and exchange anxious looks. \"It's a secret door,\" Max answers quietly. I notice that he also looks a bit off-color. \"A secret door for the king.\" \"Oh.\" I stare at the opening for a while. \"Why do you need a secret door?\" \"He claims he needs time away from us,\" Carol offers bitterly, glaring at Max. \"Really?\" I'm not surprised. These things are big, and so are their teeth and claws. Although they look cuddly, I'm still a bit wary of their tempers. \"Yeah. Apparently the king doesn't like us anymore,\" Judith puts in. \"I never said that...\" Max says. \"Implying it with a secret door is just as bad,\" Judith shoots back, folding her arms. I notice that Ira, the bulb-nosed one, is knawing on her. \"You know what? You're secret door isn't big enough, King,\" Carol says. He walks over and angrily plunges his claw into the hole, making it bigger. \"Is that big enough for you?\" The hurt in his eyes is almost unbearable. Max only stares at the ground. The wild things grumble and trudge away, exiting the fort. I start to follow them when I hear sniffling. Max has climbed into that secret door of his and is now crying. \"Max?\" I stand at the hole, peering in. He looks up at me. \"Go away.\" \"Max, I'm not leaving. Not when you're upset.\" I pause, contemplaing the situation. \"They don't like secrets, do they?\" Max shakes his head. \"It's so hard to please everyone. Carol likes it when I spend time alone with him, but the others get angry when I do that. Judith thinks I'm playing favorites, Ira needs something other than her arm to chew on, and...\" He trails off, disolving in his tears. I climb into the hole and hold him close. \"It's okay, Max.\" He looks up at me. \"I don't want to be king anymore. I want to go home.\" ... Max was in a bad mood. Well, he hadn't been five minutes ago. Five minutes ago he was helping Carol put flowers onto the awesome fort that they and the other wild things were building together. Max had taken Carol's claw and carved an \"M\" in the side of the fort, for Max; to declare to the world that he was the ruler of this fort. After that, Carol had drawn a heart around the \"M\", to show that the wild things would always love their king. Max didn't think his day could get any better than that. In truth, it couldn't; it was going to get worse. Judith had called him over and was now questioning his motives, while Ira knawed on her arm. \"I don't like the way you're ruling us, Max,\" she told him. \"I think you're playing favorites.\" \"What makes you say that?\" He wouldn't meet her eyes; he wasn't going to admit that that was true. \"Well, you're always off with Carol. Why don't you go off with me? Or with-STOP.\" She yanked her arm away from Ira's mouth. Max wasn't going to answer that. \"I think I'm doing fine.\" She scoffed, laughing her annoying laugh. Max laughed right back at her, mocking her. They continued like this, taking turns laughing at each other, mocking each other. After Max had done the loudest laugh he could muster, Judith gasped. \"What?\" Max asked her. \"You're not supposed to do that; you're the king.\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"You're supposed to care for us. If I wanna go off and spend time with you, you say, 'Okay, Judith'. And if I get hungry, you have to say, 'Okay, Judith. I love you, so it's okay if you eat me'.\" Where's Bella the Vampire when you need her? Max thought as he took in what Judith said. Suddenly, he felt someone beside him. \"Come on, Max,\" KW said. \"Let's go get some sticks.\" Max gratefully turned to follow KW, when Judith grabbed ahold of his foot. \"You'd better have heard what I just said, King,\" she said as quietly as she could ( LOL you guys know that Judith is always loud, so this task is kinda hard for her... ). KW stepped on Judith's paw, and she let go. \"Yeah,\" KW said, annoyed. \"Everyone always hears you, Judith.\" ... \"Thanks for that,\" Max said. They were ten minutes into walking through the desert. \"No problem.\" KW had been quiet, looking thoughtful. \"What? Is something wrong?\" \"No. I was just thinking about what you told me the first night you were here. About your sister.\" Me and my big mouth. Max didn't want to talk about his sister, but at the same time had been wishing someoen would bring her up. \"Yeah. Is she really a vampire?\" Max nodded. \"Yeah. She's got the sharpest fangs ever. And she can eat both humans and animals.\" KW's yellow eyes went wide. \"Wow. She must be some vampire.\" Max nodded. \"She's the fastest, strongest, smartest vampire there is. And she's really pretty, too. She's even better than...than...Edward Cullen!\" \"Who's that?\" Max shrugged. \"Some other vampire who thinks he's all that. He's really annoying. My sister and him have duels all the time. And she wins.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" Max was getting excited now. \"The last time they dueled, she poured a whole bucket of blood over his head! He was really angry with her, but it was so cool. I think he's still got bloodstains in his hair.\" \"She sounds like an interesting person,\" KW said, smiling. \"You should invite her to visit sometime.\" \"Oh, yeah...I should.\" Max walked on, suddenly realizing that there was a hole in his heart that hadn't been there before. And he was surprised that he knew that it wouldn't be filled until he saw his family again.[Chapter 33] Hey everyone! OMG I'm sorry I'm taking so long to update...again! Our computer is (possibly) fixed, but my mom still needs to call and see when we can pick it up. Also, I'm not so sure I want to go near that thing for a while, considering I'm the one who broke it....Anyway, just wanted to give you guys an update. I may be able to get access this weekend, but I'm not sure becaue I'm gonna be busy with theater committments and family matters (not to mention seeing Percy Jackson on Monday since the libraries are closed...XP). Hang in there! I promise to get the next chapter on as soon as I can! Oh! I just created a new poll on my profile page, too! You guys can vote, if you want...I'm debating if I should create a new arch in the story, but I'm leaving it up to you guys to decide. Please vote! Happy Valentine's Day! =) ~Elphie[Chapter 34] Hey! I'm back! I hope this chapter doesn't mess anything up...if it does, I can always go back and change it. P.S. The outfit Bella the Vampire wears is, obviously, the one Bella wears in New Moon . I thought it was cute, so I had her wear it. Enjoy! ... Chapter Thirty: The Other Bella Max still couldn't believe this. KW was standing in front of him, with two of the cutest owls he had ever seen. They were white, with huge yellow eyes and sweet little hoots that came from their beaks. These were the infamous Bob and Terry. \"You really think they'll help make the fort better?\" Max asked. \"I know they will!\" KW said brightly. \"They have an answer for everything . Only…\" \"Only what?\" \"Well, you have to remember to ask your question in exactly seven words.\" \"Oh. Right.\" Max remembered asking them a question a few minutes before and keeping track of the words on his fingers. He wasn't sure if he liked asking everything in only seven words. \"You wanna go live in the fort?\" KW asked the owls. \"Meep!\" said Bob. \"Meep!\" said Terry. \"Good!\" KW said. \"Let's go!\" She was about to lead the way back when she stopped and looked down the beach. \"What? What is it, KW?\" \"There's something coming toward us,\" she said simply. Max looked to where KW was watching. Sure enough, there was something coming up the beach. Max backed up, somewhat fearful of what it was. \"It…looks like a person,\" KW noted. \"Like you, Max.\" Max realized that KW was right. Walking towards them was a human girl. And…she looked really familiar somehow. Her hair was dark brown and fell a bit past her shoulders. Her eyes, from where he stood, looked hazel. She wore a green dress accentuated with black flowers, a black sweater, and black tennis shoes, similar to the ones he wore. Her skin was very pale, and seemed to glow in the sunlight. \"Hello,\" she said when she reached them. Max thought he was dreaming, but for a second he had seen fangs in her mouth. \"Hi,\" said KW. Bob and Terry hooted their greetings. Max was at a loss for words. He now knew who this was. She'd been in a countless number of his drawings, co-starred with his alter egos in stories he would make up. She'd been locked up in his mind for who knew how long. And now here she was, standing right in front of him. \"I'm Bella,\" the girl said. \"Bella the Vampire.\" \"Oh, Max, is this your sister?\" KW asked him excitedly. Max nodded. \"Yeah. This is…this is my sister.\" Bella gave him a funny look. \"You told her I was your sister?\" Max nodded again. \"Yeah…I did.\" She processed this information and turned back to KW. \"Yes. I'm his sister.\" \"I'm KW,\" KW said. \"And these are my friends, Bob and Terry.\" \"They're so cute!\" Bella squealed, scratching the owls on their heads. \"We were just heading back to our fort,\" KW informed her. \"Would you like to come with us?\" \"I would love to. Thanks,\" Bella said. \"Let's go, then.\" KW took the lead and started walking towards the desert, Bella and Max trailing behind. \"It's good to stretch my legs,\" Bella commented. \"Yeah,\" Max said vaguely. \"You know, since I've been locked up for so long.\" Max looked at his feet. \"Sorry about that. I didn't want to, but…my sister—\" \"Your real sister?\" \"Right. Look, I just told KW that because...because it seemed more interesting if she were you than if she were...herself.\" \"So you lied?\" \"No...well...maybe...\" She was putting words into his mouth, and he didn't like it. \"I can see you've already stretched the truth enough, but don't do it again.\" She sighed. \"Anyway, so your real sister - the real Bella - what didn't she like?\" \"She didn't like that stuff anymore. The vampire stuff. Those books ruined it for her, she even said so. I wanted to keep her happy.\" \"Oh.\" Bella seemed to understand. \"Why would you let something like that hold you back?\" \"I don't know. It's…complicated.\" \"How do you think I felt about it? Being locked away in your mind for four years?\" Max gulped. \"It's…not that fun in there?\" She shrugged. \"You have your good days and you have your bad. Mostly there've been bad days. Bad thoughts, bad plans…and I see your mom and your sisters a lot when you think like that.\" Max didn't say anything to that, feeling guilty about the things he'd thought about Connie, Claire and Bella. \"Kind of hard being a family, right?\" Bella asked him. Max glared at her. \"So what made you decide to finally break free?\" he asked, changing the subject. \"Well, I'm here for two reasons. The first is that you miss your family. I know you do. So when you were talking to KW about me earlier and started to realize that you really were longing to go back home, I was released to help ease your homesickness.\" \"I'm not homesick,\" Max lied. Bella shrugged. \"Okay.\" \"What's the second reason?\" \"I wanted some time away from my clan. They just kicked out one of our vampires because all his teeth fell out.\" Max felt a cold rush chill him. \"Really?\" \"I wanted him to stay, but I was overruled by everyone else, and we haven't seen him since. I can't believe they'd do that to him.\" \"Vampires can be cruel like that sometimes,\" Max said quickly. \"You should know.\" Bella stared coldly at him. Max realized he'd offended her. \"Sorry,\" he said to the sand, unable to meet her eyes. \"I didn't mean…\" \"I know what you meant,\" she said. \"I'm still a bit touchy after what the others said when I took my leave.\" Her eyes hardened. \"They called me a coward and a softy, and that I cannot possibly be a vampire because I'm too sensitive.\" She shook her head and sighed. \"I can change them, if you want,\" Max offered. \"I created them, I can just as easily make them nice.\" Bella shook her head. \"You don't have to do that. Besides, I'm not here just for me. I'm here mostly because of you.\" Max's eyebrows came together in confusion. \"Why me?\" \"I'm worried about you. Or should I say, your sister is worried about you. Since you made me in her image, I have a connection with her, and I can feel her emotions. She's very concerned that you're in trouble.\" \"Yeah right,\" Max scoffed. \"She's probably grateful that I'm gone.\" Bella's face went slack and her tone softened. \"I'm not kidding around, Max. She really is fretting about you.\" Max laughed. \"'Fretting'? What kind of word is that?\" Bella rolled her eyes. \"Okay, so maybe my vocabulary isn't all that modern. But you get my point. I wouldn't be surprised if she's out looking for you.\" \"Sure she is,\" Max said, running to catch up with KW. Bella had no choice but to close the subject for the moment and follow them. ... My Weird, Crazy Dream – Part V As told in 1 st Person by Bella Carson Later that day, I find Carol sitting by himself, overlooking the sea. I tentatively walk up to him, afraid that he might thrash out at me. \"Hi, Carol,\" I say. He turns to me. \"Oh. It's you.\" He turns back to the ocean. \"I thought it was Max.\" I sit down next to him. \"You know, Max isn't all that bad.\" He snorts. \"I'll bet he told you to say that.\" I shook my head. \"He didn't.\" I sigh. \"Carol…you have to realize that he's just a kid. He can't do everything you ask of him.\" \"But he's the king!\" Carol protests. \"He's supposed to have all these magical powers and he said that he would help us stay together!\" Max, you're such an idiot, I think. \"I know he promised all that stuff to you. But…he expects as much from you as you do from him.\" Carol looked at me. \"I…I never thought about it that way.\" His eyes become sad. \"I guess he really isn't all that good of a king.\" I shrug. \"Well, I can't comment because haven't been here for even a whole day.\" \"Is he this bad at home?\" I take a while to answer this. \"He's very impulsive,\" I finally say. \"But he's not a bad person. I just think that maybe if we all calmed down…we could figure something out.\" Carol looks wary. \"I don't know…\" \"Think about it?\" Carol reluctantly nods. \"Okay. I'll think about it.\" \"I know it's difficult,\" I say. \"But we can't lose faith in him now.\" At this, Carol grunts and once again looks unsure. I realize that persuading him further won't do any good, so I get up and go off by myself, wondering what to do next. While I do this, I hear an argument that the others are having, and it's pretty brutal. I even hear some physical violence taking place. This sparks in me a solution, and I race back to the fort. I now know what Max and I must do.[Chapter 35] Chapter Thirty-One: Trouble on the Home Front Wait…does that Lovejoy guy end up getting off the ship? Wasn't he with Cal? He had to be…but then they got separated, I think…and then he somehow got blood all over his face. Yeah! And then when the boat split in half, he falls through the hole! So he technically did get off the ship…but then he dies. Bella shook her head, trying to clear the mental image of a middle-aged weirdo falling into the icy depths of the ocean. Death was one thing she definitely didn't need floating around in her mind at the moment. She had to admit, Titanic was pretty amazing. There was a perfect balance of historical events woven into the story of Jack and Rose. It somehow always had her rapt attention; no matter what was going on in her life, she could always count on that movie to help her through the rough spots. She closed her eyes and sighed. Why was she thinking about a ship? She kicked some snow in front of the bench, watching it turn to water on her boots. Her little brother was still out there. She didn't know how long she'd been searching…surely the sun would rise any moment now. Or perhaps it had only been a few minutes, the fear of anxiety stretching it out to seem like hours. Think about something else…you can't worry forever… She conceded with herself. Thinking about other things wouldn't hurt, right? It would help her with the frustration she felt towards not finding her brother as quick as she'd thought. And something like that wasn't going to harm anyone. What had she been thinking about? Oh, right. The movie. She loved the movie. But she didn't love James Cameron, the director. For a while, she'd thought he was pretty cool. But then came the fateful day she'd heard on the radio that he was a jerk and had been married about six times. He was very demanding, and had called Kate Winslet \"Kate Weighs-A-Lot\" to her face when she hadn't fit into a size 0 dress for Titanic . Claire had claimed she'd known his true self all along. \"It's all the same with celebrities,\" she'd said. \"Everyone in that business is cracked.\" Bella had then pointed out that Claire had a huge crush on people like Channing Tatum and Sterling Knight. \"So?\" Claire had asked. \"I think they're hot. Big deal. Just because I have a crush on them doesn't mean I ever want to date them.\" Suddenly Bella missed her sister's snide comments. What would she say when she came home tomorrow and found out that Max had run away? Would she even care? She would have to. Max was her brother. Even if Claire couldn't stand him most of the time, she'd have to be a tiny bit concerned that he'd left. All this wondering was making Bella weary and hungry at the same time. She had already downed all her fish crackers and one-and-a-half bottles of water. She couldn't go back home until she found Max, so she had to ration out the remaining half-bottle. Bella looked at her watch and decided to work out exactly how long she'd been out here. It was eight-thirty right now. Dinner would have been at seven. Max had started to cause chaos at six-fortyish, and had run away around six-fifty-fiveish. She'd probably left the house at around seven-ten or seven-fifteen. So she'd been searching for approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. It hadn't seemed all that long before. But then again, she'd been weighed down with thoughts of what had happened at home. She suddenly felt like kicking herself. What had made her act so stupid to everyone? Life would have been much easier if she hadn't decided to make up plans and act like a moron. If she hadn't done all that, maybe she wouldn't be out here in the dead of night in the middle of winter, searching frantically for the one person in her life who truly understood her. Wow…that's some deep stuff. Maybe I should write a book or something… The street was alight with white and orange. Bella turned to her left. Coming down the street was a car. She couldn't really tell what kind of car it was, but it seemed familiar… \"I knew I'd find you…\" said a voice from the open window. Bella felt her blood run cold. It couldn't be… \"Now get in the car like a good girl,\" the man said, his face obscured in the darkness. She had ditched him a while ago, she was sure of it. How had he caught up? It didn't make any sense to her. \"Get in the car, and maybe I'll be nice,\" the man said. She could tell he was getting angry. Bella sat, dumbstruck. What should she do? She couldn't get in that car. That much was clear. But what would happen if she didn't? Should she call the police? Should she run and tell one of the neighbors? \"Just get in the car!\" He began to unbuckle his seatbelt. You gotta think, Bella…he's getting out of the car! She reached into her backpack and pulled out the first thing that her hands grabbed. A few seconds later, her half-full water bottle was knocking the guy in the face. Bella didn't hang around long enough to revel in the guy's injury. She started to run, making sure she got as far as she could before ducking around a corner. Once again, the car didn't seem to follow her. But she wasn't going to take any chances. She again tried to distance herself as far as she could from the car, hoping that she wouldn't run into it again that night. ... Max jumped over the sand dunes and found Carol sitting on the beach. There were a million things he wanted to say to his friend, but he didn't know where to start, exactly. He was sure that bringing the owls – and the addition of Bella – to the fort wouldn't cause a lot of problems. Bob and Terry were KW's friends, and they seemed…interesting enough. And Bella was something out of his mind, his own creation; it was only right that she be let in. Boy, had he been wrong. The others had thought Bob and Terry were very adorable, and Bella was easily a favorite. Even Judith, who was always hard to please, definitely thought the newcomers were something special. It had all gone smoothly. Until Carol opened his mouth. \"Max,\" he'd said conversationally, \"I think the fort's broken.\" \"What? What do you mean?\" \"I thought you said that if someone we didn't like came in here, the fort would automatically cut their brains out.\" Carol looked at him as if expecting Max to will the fort to detach the three brains on the spot. \"Well…it's okay that they're in here,\" Max said. \"I want them in here, so their brains don't have to be cut out.\" It was lame, but he didn't know how else to clarify things. To make matters worse, Carol shortly left in a huff, leaving a very awkward mood over everyone. Max had forgotten that Carol was easily threatened by outsiders, and also wasn't too thrilled that KW had friends other than him and the others. Why hadn't he remembered? He could have saved that whole confrontation if he hadn't been so forgetful. Bella was on his case the minute Carol was gone. She had pulled him outside and given it right to him. \"Why didn't you mention that Carol has issues with new people?\" she demanded. \"I…I didn't think it'd be a problem,\" Max said honestly. \"Oh, of course you didn't.\" She heaved a sigh and folded her arms across her chest. \"Max, I swear…sometimes…you don't think.\" \"Well…maybe I could think if you weren't hounding me about things!\" Max shot back. \"I don't need your input. You're just a figment of my imagination! I wish I'd never let you out!\" Bella just stared at him. \"Okay, then. I'll...I can just leave. And not come back.\" \"Fine. Go ahead. This is exactly why I left in the first place. No one ever listens to me! Everyone always blames me for everything! And now you're doing it, too! You're just as bad as she is!\" With that, he'd taken off, knowing that if he stayed, he'd say even more things that would be much better off unspoken. Now he cautiously approached Carol, who was covered in sand and wearing one of the saddest expressions Max had ever seen. \"I can't believe KW,\" Carol said, apparently noticing Max's presence. \"I mean…what does she see in those bird things? They're so…weird!\" He looked at Max. \"I couldn't understand a word they said.\" \"It's okay,\" Max said. \"I really couldn't understand them, either.\" \"And…and what about that…leech thing?\" Carol accused. \"How do you know she doesn't eat creatures like us?\" Despite his anger for her, Max knew Bella didn't deserve to be called a leech. \"She told me she doesn't hunt creatures like you. She's friends with your kind.\" Carol didn't seem convinced. \"You're gonna help us, right, Max? You're gonna fix everything, aren't you?\" Max was prepared to answer this question. While searching for Carol's whereabouts, he'd come up with a brilliant idea to try out on his new friends. \"Of course,\" Max said, smiling at his idea. \"I know exactly what to do.\"[Chapter 36] Hey! Here's a chapter that's totally dedicated to a crucial part of Bella's weird, crazy dream! Enjoy! P.S. Some of the ideas/themes came, once again, from The Wild Things by Dave Eggers. And I don't own that. ... Chapter Thirty-Two: Vampire Are Breakable My Weird, Crazy Dream – Part VI As told in 1 st Person by Bella Carson Well, I can't really tell Max what the plan is, because the wild things could be listening. And if they hear me, I know they won't be very happy. They'll probably get so angry, they'll try to eat me, like they did in the first part of my dream. So all I can do is go to bed by the fire in the fort, troubled by the huge creatures surrounding my brother and I. I'm having a dream within a dream (ha, that sounds weird) about Max sailing in his boat when I jolt awake. \"Wake up, everyone! Wake up! Get out here!\" It's Carol. He's acting really, really strange. Like he's scared of something. Everyone gathers to where Carol is standing. He's looking up at the sky. \"It's not there! It's supposed to be right there!\" \"What is?\" Ira asks sleepily. \"The sun! It's not there!\" The wild things look at each other like Carol's gone insane. I glance at Max, who's become considerably paler… And then I remember. That one day he told us that he'd learned in school that the sun was going to die someday. I wasn't here when it happened, but I'm pretty sure that Max passed this information on to Carol. Not the smartest idea. \"I think it's still nighttime,\" Douglas gently explains. \"No! I've been up all night! It's morning!\" Carol insisted. \"But…but it's still dark out,\" Alexander said. \"That's the point! It's morning, but where's the sun?\" \"Maybe it's late?\" suggested Douglas. \"Or hiding from you,\" Judith mumbles. \"That's stupid! The sun is never late! You know what I think? It's…it's dead!\" Oh, no. Now things are gonna get ugly. \"That's not gonna happen for a very, very long time!\" Max said, but I can see him starting to worry that the sun really is dead. (I don't know...it's a dream, so for all I know, something crazy like that really did happen.) \"This is all your fault, Max!\" Carol shouts. \"You're a terrible king!\" \"He's not a king,\" Douglas says quietly. Carol whips around. \"What?\" \"He's not a king,\" Douglas repeats. I stare at Douglas in disbelief. Why is he doing this now? He's just making things worse. I make my way over to Max, just in case I have to intervene. \"You're lying!\" Carol says. \"No, I'm not. He's just a boy pretending to be a wolf pretending to be a king.\" Stop, Douglas , I plead in my mind. Too bad I don't have telepathy or whatever. \"You're lying! Everyone's lying! AAAAGGGGHHHHH!\" Carol runs at Douglas and rips his arm right off! Instead of blood coming out, sand pours forth. \"Carol, look what you did!\" Douglas says. He doesn't sound very angry at all. \"That was my favorite arm!\" Carol looks confused, but that's quickly replaced with a look of dawning comprehension as he glares at Max. \"You did this!\" \"Me?\" I can feel Max start to tremble beside me. \"Is this what you wanted?\" Carol asks forcefully. \"Did you want the sun to die? Did you want to make secret doors? Did you want a bloodsucker to come to the island?\" At this remark I can't help myself. I bare my fangs and arch protectively over my younger brother. No one calls me a bloodsucker and gets away with it. \"Did you want Douglas's arm to get ripped off?\" He's acting like Max actually did that, and that makes me angry. That was all him, the big buffoon! \"It's not my fault,\" Max pips up unhelpfully. \"What, so it's my fault, then? Everything you did, it's my fault?\" Carol growls as he inches towards us. \"No—\" \"That's what you think, isn't it?\" He comes towards us, but I get in front of Max before he gets there. \"Don't come any closer, Carol,\" I warn. \"Get out of the way, leech,\" he snarls. \"I'd like a few words with our king.\" \"I'm not letting you near him.\" I have no idea why I'm so brave. Inside, I'm screaming at myself, telling myself I need to get out of there because Carol looks like he's about to eat someone. But I can't leave Max alone with these beasts. It's too dangerous. \"You'd better move, or I'll throw you out of here. Or worse.\" He shows his teeth and growls deeply. \"I don't care what happens to me,\" I say, baring my fangs right back at him. \"You're not going to hurt Max.\" \"Who says I was gonna hurt him?\" Carol takes another step, but I stand my ground. \"Isn't it obvious?\" \"So it's obvious that I'm a big, destructive monster?\" Carol says, his voice rising. \"Bella, get out of here,\" Douglas instructs me. He's still holding the stump that used to be his arm, and he looks deadly serious. \"No,\" I answer Carol. \"It's obvious that you wanna do more than just 'talk' to my brother.\" \"Oh, and that's any different from me being a monster?\" Carol looks very angry now. \"Bella, get out of here,\" Douglas repeats, more urgently. \"Take Max and run.\" I want to. No one knows how bad I want to do what Douglas is telling me to do. But I know that I can't back down from Carol, no matter how scary he is. I have to do this. He needs to know that what he's doing is not okay with me. \"You have to calm down, Carol,\" I insist. \"You're getting out of control!\" This pushes him over the edge. He raises his claws, but not before I push Max out of the way. I feel sharp, shooting pain all over my arms, and suddenly in my back. I'm on the floor, sticks and twigs raining down from where I hit the wall. My arms are a different color. They're redder. Carol is still breathing hard, but eventually calms down. He walks out of the fort, looking frightened and upset. Douglas goes off to fix his arm, and the others leave, as well, for reasons unknown. Max and I are the only ones left. I manage to sit up, and try to hide the pain on my face. Max doesn't need to see that I've been weakened. He sits beside me and bursts into tears. \"This…is all…my fault…\" he sobs. \"No, it's not,\" I say soothingly. I want to hug him, but I'm afraid of getting blood all over his wolf suit. Bandages magically appear beside me (Hello! I'm in a dream, remember?) and I quickly wrap up my arms. \"We need to leave, Bella…\" he says quietly through his tears. \"I have a feeling that if we stay, Carol's gonna do something bad to everyone.\" \"I've got it covered,\" I say, telling him my plan. \"When they're all sleeping, we can sneak away in your boat and go home.\" \"No, we can't,\" he says. \"What do you mean?\" \"The boat got away.\" He looks at me sadly. \"The knot wasn't tied properly. I don't know where it went.\" That would happen to me , I think angrily. Dumb knots. Ugh, I can't believe this! So we're stuck here. I mean, I can run fast, but not over the water. (No, not even in my dreams.) And it's not like I'd magically know which way to go. (With my luck, we'd end up on some crazy island…well, crazier than this one, anyway.) \"What are we gonna do?\" Max starts to cry again, and begins to sob into my shoulder. \"Don't worry, Max,\" I say, hugging him gingerly. \"We'll figure something out.\"[Chapter 37] Hey! Sorry I didn't update sooner! I was having a lot of fun this week - and I didn't even go on vacation for break LOL! Plus I wanted to get the DVD first in order to be accurate with the dialogue and events. And guess what? I GOT IT! TODAY! I'm super happy! ^-^ And I was able to watch the scene I needed for this chapter! DISCLAIMER: I don't own this movie. Obviously. P.S. This is a Max-centric chapter, so no Bella (but there is some Bella the Vampire...) P.P.S. This chapter's extra-long, since I haven't updated in forever. Enjoy! ... Chapter Thirty-Three: The Dirt Clod War \"Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna have a war!\" Max exclaimed. \"And we're gonna completely clobber each other!\" He had gathered the group in the middle of the woods to explain his brilliant plan. The only ones absent were KW and Bella. KW had gone off to bring Bob and Terry home, while Bella had mysteriously disappeared somewhere. Max hoped KW got back in time to play with him and the others, but his feelings for his sister's alter ego weren't completely mended, and he hoped she stayed away from him for the time being. \"Clobber each other?\" Ira repeated, interested. \"Yeah, with these dirt clods,\" Max held up a ball of dirt so everyone could see. \"I used to do it a ton when I was a little kid.\" Of course, I'd always do it with Bella and Claire… \"We…we haven't had a dirt clod fight in a long time,\" Douglas remarked. \"It's the best way to have fun together,\" Max went on. \"Life was simpler back then with the dirt clods…\" Ira said fondly. \"So who wants to be a Bad Guy?\" Max asked. The wild things looked at each other, no one saying anything. Typical response. No one ever wanted to be a Bad Guy. \"Okay, then. I'll pick one.\" He looked around the group. Who would be best at being bad? His eyes fell on Judith. She didn't like him much, and she irritated him a lot, so that automatically made her his opponent. \"Um…okay, you're a Bad Guy,\" he said, pointing at her. \"Yeah, saw that coming,\" she said sarcastically. Max ignored her and continued to look. Alexander went into consideration. He was always underfoot, saying random stuff no one cared about. He got on Max's nerves almost as much as Judith, and suddenly Max wanted Alexander to be a Bad Guy. \"You're definitely a Bad Guy,\" Max told him. \"What?\" Alexander looked disappointed. \"Aw, man.\" \"And you can pick one other,\" Max said, trying to make the playing field even. \"I'll be a Bad Guy,\" Ira said, raising his hand. \"I wanna be bad.\" Judith looked at Max. \"Okay, we pick you.\" Max saw what she was trying to do, and was ready to refute it. \"No, I can't be a Bad Guy,\" he said, laughing. \"I'm the king. I'm a Good Guy.\" \"I'm a Bad Guy!\" Ira chanted, his hand rising higher. \"I'm a Bad Guy!\" \"Okay, you can be a Bad Guy,\" Max agreed. He didn't care where he placed Ira, and if Ira wanted to be on the Bad Guy team, then Max would let him be on it. \"Judy! I'm on your team!\" Ira said excitedly. \"Yeah, I heard,\" she said, still upset about being a Bad Guy. \"And you…\" Max looked to where the Bull sat behind everyone else. \"He's…he's with you.\" Max didn't know the Bull very well, and was still a bit scared of him. \"Am I a Good Guy, then?\" Douglas asked Carol. \"Of course! You've got the best arm!\" Carol answered proudly. Max smiled. He had the sensible people on his team. Douglas was smart (and he had a good arm, from the sound of it), and Carol was really aggressive. Now that only left one more person to be on their team… \"Hey!\" Judith called sharply. \"Where were you?\" Everyone turned to see KW coming towards them, an indifferent look on her face. \"Just making sure Bob and Terry still have their brains.\" She gave a pointed look at Carol. \"They do.\" \"KW!\" Max called, running to where she was. This was perfect. She could be on their team. \"Hey, KW!\" Alexander said. \"You wanna be on my team? We're the Bad Guys!\" He almost sang the last sentence, trying to make it sound cool. \"No, no, no! No! You're with us!\" Max said, taking her paw in his hand. \"You're a Good Guy.\" \"Yeah, come on, KW,\" Carol mumbled, almost incoherently. \"Be a Good Guy.\" \"Okay, so you're on my team,\" Max explained as they approached Carol and Douglas. \"You and me and Carol and Douglas.\" \"Hi, KW,\" Carol said awkwardly. She looked sideways at him before turning back to Max. \"Okay, so what we're gonna try to do is kill the Bad Guys,\" Max told his team, \"by beating them in the head with these dirt clods.\" KW and Carol looked at each other, a bit wary. Douglas nodded, seeming to understand. \"And we're gonna try to find the biggest pieces so—\" A big dirt clod hit him in the head. Carol caught him before he could fall over. The war had officially begun. \"You didn't see that coming!\" called Alexander. Judith and Ira followed his lead and threw dirt clods towards them. \"Run for cover!\" Max yelled. \"You'd better run!\" Judith shouted. Off they went. Max ran right behind KW, Carol and Douglas leading as dirt clods landed and exploded all around them. They made it to the desert part of the island. The Bad Guys had run off Carol and KW; Max was alone with Douglas. But they were still being pursued, Max knew they were. And with this knowledge, Max started to laugh. This was how things were supposed to be. \"Look out for the Bad Guys!\" came Ira's voice. A shower of dirt clods and tree branches rained down. A huge boulder was hurtling towards them. Max was frightened for a moment. What if— He reappeared ten feet away as the boulder landed where he'd just been. What had just happened? He was about to be crushed by a boulder…and now he had magically been put out of harm's way. He could have sworn he heard someone call jokingly, \"Get your head out of the clouds, Max!\" He found Carol and KW behind a huge log. \"We've got them pinned down!\" Carol informed them as Douglas ran up. \"They can't even move!\" About thirty feet away were the Bad Guys hiding behind another huge log, cowering from the dirt clods being hurled by the Good Guys. \"Fire on three!\" Max commanded. \"Okay!\" Douglas said. \"One…two…THREE!\" Dirt clods went shooting over, showering Judith and Ira with dirt and rocks. Max giggled with giddiness. \"Wait…wait,\" he said through his laughter, holding off an attack from his team. \"I have an idea.\" They stopped to watch him. \"Come out!\" Max called. \"No!\" Judith answered, peeking out from behind the log. \"Why not?\" \"Uh, cause you're gonna hit us in the head with dirt!\" Judith said, as if it were obvious. \"Max, how is this helping?\" Carol's brow furrowed in confusion. \"Hang on, okay?\" He turned back to the log. \"Come out!\" he called again. \"No!\" was the response from Judith. \"Why not?\" \"Because when I said you're gonna hit us in the head with dirt, you didn't say anything! That means you're gonna hit us in the head with dirt!\" Max's face fell. \"Man…they really got us figured out.\" It only took him a moment to come up with a new plan. \"Okay, let's go!\" he called to his teammates. \"CHAAAARRRGE!\" They hurled dirt clods at Judith and Ira, who retreated quickly. Explosions and screaming started up again instantly. \"Good shot!\" Ira called. \"I'm gonna get you!\" Huge dirt clods fell dangerously close to where Max was. Strangely, he wasn't hit with the bigger ones. But he didn't have time to puzzle how this was so. He and Douglas slid into a ravine, closely followed by Carol and KW. They threw more balls of dirt at the opposing team, hitting them almost every single time. Max let out a new fit of giggles. A raccoon appeared on the ground, hissing viciously. \"Hey! Who threw Richard?\" Carol asked, picking the animal up. \"He's on our team now!\" He threw the raccoon, and he landed on Ira's huge nose, clawing wildly. \"No throwing animals!\" Ira cried. \"Get it off! It hurts! It really hurts!\" Max saw Alexander sneaking his way to where his team was staked out. Now was the time to rack up a few more points for the Good Guys. \"Hey, Douglas,\" Max said. \"Get the goat.\" \"Okay,\" Douglas said. \"Knock his legs over,\" Max said. \"Got it.\" Douglas grunted as he hurled a dirt clod at Alexander's legs. The small wild thing did a back flip and landed hard on the rocks. \"Ow, you guys! That hurt!\" Max tried to stifle a giggle. Seeing Alexander this angry was making him happy all over again. \"I'm not playing anymore!\" Alexander exclaimed, walking away. \"Come on!\" Judith yelled. \"Fight with us!\" \"No!\" \"Do it again!\" Max said to Douglas. No sooner had he said this, another dirt clod hit Alexander square in the back, knocking him down. \"That's not fair! That's cheating! Are your crazy?\" Alexander screamed, clearly upset. \"You're supposed to get hit!\" Judith said. \"It's a war!\" \"That wasn't fair!\" Alexander existed. \"Douglas hit me when I was hurt! You're not supposed to hit someone when they're hurt!\" He turned around. \"I quit!\" \"Get back here!\" Judith barked, growing angry. Max slid further into the ravine, a bit embarrassed that he'd caused a fight among the Bad Guys. \"Alexander, don't you cry!\" Judith shouted. \"Alex, count to ten! Everything'll be fine!\" Ira suggested. \"If I count to ten, will you be gone, Ira?\" Alexander spat. \"Don't you dare talk to him like that!\" Judith yelled. \"Knock it off!\" Max shouted. He couldn't take this anymore. He threw a dirt clod willy-nilly. \"Ow!\" Judith cried. \"That's my eye!\" The war quickly forgot about Alexander, and Max wanted it to stay that way. Judith flew through the air, letting loose a legion of smaller dirt clods. The Bull was hit a few times, but that was sufficient enough to make him fall over. The Good Guys migrated out of the ravine. Carol tripped and fell on his back, while Max tripped over Carol's body. Douglas was right behind them, and he tripped over the side of Carol's head. \"Oh, Carol!\" he said. \"I'm sorry!\" KW came by, jumping on Carol's face and knocking into Douglas. \"What's the matter?\" she asked Carol playfully. \"Someone step on your head?\" Carol got up, but instead of laughing like KW, he looked irritated and angry. \"What are you doing?\" he asked her. Max realized suddenly that Carol wasn't pleased with being stepped on. He froze where he was, not knowing what to do. \"What?\" KW asked. \"Don't step on my head!\" KW looked at him funny. \"What do you mean? It's a war . Douglas just did it.\" \"Yeah, but he did it on accident! You did it on purpose!\" he said, pointing at her accusingly. \"And he didn't step on the face part of my head!\" Max hid behind a few tree roots, clinging to them, fearful of what would happen if this fight spiraled out of control. He felt the pressure of reassuring hands on his shoulders, but he was sure no one else was there. \"It was a joke,\" KW said quietly, becoming angry as well. \"I was just joking.\" \"Like you aren't always looking for the opportunity to step on my head,\" Carol growled. \"Cause that's what you do.\" Max held his breath, almost wanting someone to throw a punch or…something. Anything to end this tension. Although he did admit the invisible hands on his shoulders were a bit comforting. \"Fine,\" KW said. \"Fine. You know what? This is exactly why I don't wanna do anything with you anymore.\" She laid down on her back and pointed to her head. \"Go ahead. Step on my head.\" Carol considered it for a moment before restraining himself. \"Forget it. I'm not gonna step on your head just to make you feel better.\" Explosions were heard, but they seemed far away now. Carol turned to where Douglas hid behind a pile of rocks. \"Come on, Douglas, let's go,\" he said. \"Carol, I thought you did the right thing,\" Douglas said weakly as the two friends walked away. Max noticed that the coast was clear. Before going over to KW, he turned around. He was sure someone had to have been there. But he saw no one. It made him confused, but he couldn't think about that right now. He slowly walked to where KW lay. He carefully put his right foot on her forehead, hoping that it would make her feel better. \"Thanks Max,\" she said sadly. \"But…I'm done. I don't know why I came back here. Glad I met you, I guess.\" Max didn't know what to say. He didn't want KW to leave, but at the same time he understood why she wanted to. He decided not to tell her how he felt about the situation for fear of worsening it. \"Where's your sister?\" she asked. \"She leave, too?\" Max nodded numbly. \"She's angry with me. She needs time by herself.\" \"That's what I need,\" KW said. \"You get that, right, Max?\" He did, but he wasn't about to say so. Right then he wanted to rewind the day and pretend none of this ever happened. ... Unfortunately, the others weren't about to let Max forget what he'd done. They were in the spot where they'd picked teams for the war, sitting in a circle and grumbling to each other as the sky grew dark. Max hugged his knees and tried not to make eye contact. He knew that everyone was upset with him, but he didn't want to look at their faces. It would just make him feel worse. \"So, King, what's goin' on?\" Judith asked, breaking the silence with her aggravating voice. \"This is how you rule your kingdom? Everyone fighting? The Bad Guys feel bad…heck, everyone feels bad.\" Don't you think I realize that? he wanted to scream. He kept quiet and tried to hide beneath his matted brown bangs. \"I still feel dizzy,\" Ira complained quietly. \"My eyeballs feel loose.\" \"Oh, can it, Ira,\" Judith snapped. \"Everyone's eyeballs feel loose.\" Max wanted to do something. But what? He was just a pathetic little boy, unable to do anything. Why couldn't he have powers like Max the Super Wolf? \"No,\" Carol said. \"Max can rule his kingdom. He'll keep us all together. He has powers. He told us.\" He turned his hopeful gaze to Max. \"Right, Max? Show us. Please.\" Max had run out of ideas. He was scared out of his wits. He was in a circle of huge beasts who were prepared to eat him. What was he going to do? There had to be something. A trick of some sorts, maybe? Or…yes! Yes, it had to work! It always made people feel happy back in his old home. Why couldn't it work here? Max got up and promptly started to execute his robot dance. They all stared in awe. Max thought it was because they were impressed. But he would soon learn the reason for their intent looks. \"Uh, oh,\" Ira said. \"Somebody broke the king.\" He slowed down a bit, but didn't stop. This had to work. \"I don't get it,\" Judith said. This made him cease his movements. Maybe it wouldn't work. \"Oh, wait. I do,\" Judith stated. \"It's stupid .\" Max looked around the circle. Alexander sighed and turned away. Ira and Judith were still fixed on him. Douglas was drawing in the dirt. The Bull was staring at a nearby tree, oblivious. Carol gave him a look worthy of making Max's heart crack further. \" That's what we waited for?\" Judith asked. Max didn't know how to answer. He was stuck where he was, unable to move. The temperature dropped, and snow began to fall. The group looked up at the sky, taking this as their sign to ditch the meeting and leave Max alone with his thoughts. Before they disappeared, Carol looked back. Max pleaded with him silently, begging him not to leave. Carol shook his head and turned away, following the others as they made their way back to the fort. They couldn't leave him out here all alone. He wanted to follow, but wasn't sure if he should. \"CAROL?\" he called, his voice echoing off the nearby trees. He got no answer. Or rather, he did get an answer to whether or not he should return to the fort that night. It was as clear as if he'd asked a magic eight ball: No. He started to shiver, and the snow continued to fall. He made his way to a tree with huge roots and snuggled into them, trying to keep warm. His dirty wolf suit wasn't going to be enough to shut out the cold. He was drowsy and wasn't concerned if he was freezing or not. He just wanted to go to sleep and escape all the mistakes he'd made, the trouble he'd caused for these creatures. It was all his fault… The feeling of arms came over him, and he was sure that the same hands who had comforted him earlier during the war were with him now. He didn't mind; they were familiar, and made him feel safe. \"It's okay, Max…\" someone whispered. \"Everything's okay.\" He wanted to say something back, but was too tired to answer. And Max Carson finally fell asleep on that cold, snowy night, on the island where the Wild Things are, with Bella the Vampire watching over him.[Chapter 38] LOL the part about Bella (the real Bella) was inspired by the four-five pages in the book New Moon dedicated to showing how long Bella went into her depression because Edward had left. .......... Chapter Thirty-Four: Facing Another Day She wasn't going to take much more. She'd been outside for two-and-a-half hours now. And it was getting to her. Bella was starting to wonder if Max was just hiding from everyone. He was probably following her, making himself hidden from view, thinking he could mess with her. He thought he was being funny, wasn't he? Stop thinking like that. You know he wouldn't do that. But what if he did? Max was so unreadable these days, he could have taken a plane to Denmark tonight, for all she knew. She found another bench on the corner and sat down. She couldn't believe that after this long, she still hadn't found him. Knowing this, a horrible feeling came over her. Somehow, she knew she'd be going home tonight without her brother. Bella didn't move from the bench, and she didn't feel anything when a wave of depression came over her and she went down, down, down into the depths of sadness. ... 9:45 ... 10:00 ... 10:15 ... 10:30 ... It was around 10:35 when Bella fell asleep. .......... The next morning, Max awoke to a thick layer of clouds. At first, he thought he was in heaven, but then he realized that it was only fog. He slowly got up and stretched, seeing that all the snow from the previous night had melted, meaning that today would probably be warmer. Without warning, he remembered all that had happened to him on the island. He swallowed, knowing he was in huge trouble with everyone. Now he really did wish he was some sort of king or a super wolf or something more exciting than just a regular boy. How had things gotten so out of hand? That was an easy question to answer. It was him. He ruined everything. Nothing he ever did came out right. His family was broken, the wild things were disgruntled and petulant, and his mind was thoroughly in shambles. So…what happened now? He got up and trudged through the woods, not knowing what lay ahead. He felt like a zombie, going wherever his feet took him and not processing anything. He finally came to the edge of a cliff, and before he blindly walked off into the ocean, he stopped. Out before him lay the sea. The wind was blowing, brushing his disheveled hair from his face. The salt stung at his eyes, which he found were already tearing up on their own. He spent about an hour by himself, thinking about what needed to happen to make things better again. He heard someone behind him. It wasn't one of the wild things; the footsteps were too cautious and small to belong to any one of them. He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, to some extent afraid of the confrontation he knew was about to happen. Bella the Vampire stood beside him, staring into the space beyond. He could see that tears were forming in the corner of her eyes, as well. He was about to say something when she beat him to it. \"There used to be a cliff just like this,\" she said. \"Me and the others would go there all the time. I miss it so much.\" \"What happened?\" Max asked, his curiosity taking over. Bella shrugged. \"Too many earthquakes…a lot of rainstorms…everyone became scared of his own shadow. No one goes out anymore.\" \"Because of me?\" Bella looked at him. \"What?\" \"I caused all that, right? The earthquakes, the rainstorms…your vampire friend being kicked out. It was all me. Wasn't it?\" She didn't say anything. It didn't make him feel any better. \"You don't have to lie. I know it's me.\" \"It's not your fault, Max,\" Bella said gently. \"All that stuff happens because of what happens around you. Your mind adjusts to your surroundings.\" \"I ruin my surroundings.\" Max looked up at her. \"I ruin everything.\" \"You don't, Max.\" She put an arm around him. \"You don't know how special you are.\" Special? She thought he was special ? How could she think good of someone like him? \"We have to go back to the fort,\" he said in response. \"We?\" Bella smiled sadly. \"Max…this might be a long shot, but…I'm pretty sure that after what happened yesterday, I won't be welcomed back to the fort again.\" \"I don't wanna go alone.\" Max became panicked. \"I don't wanna be eaten.\" He felt Bella's grip on him shoulder tighten. \"I'll keep close tabs on you, alright? No one's gonna eat anyone. At least…not while I'm here. And if those guys try anything funny, or you really need me, I'll go in, alright?\" Max managed a smile. \"You sure I can't trade one of my sisters for you?\" .......... A while later, Max trudged through the back entrance of the fort. He made sure he was as quiet as possible, lest he disturb any of the wild things. Although Bella had assured him that she was right outside the fort and would intervene if he needed her, he still couldn't sooth his pounding heart. Halfway across the room, he spotted Alexander, sitting on a log and watching the sun slowly make its way up through the sky. He didn't seem angry; he seemed sad. \"Hi,\" Max said quietly before he could stop himself. Alexander looked up. When he saw who it was, he went back to watching the sky. Max cautiously went and sat beside the goat-like wild thing. Neither said a word for a few moments. Max saw that there was a deep gash on Alexander's back. Instead of looking red, it was a brownish-black color. \"Is that from the dirt clods?\" Max asked. \"Yeah,\" Alexander said. \"It's from when you had Douglas hit me.\" The memory came back, and Max felt very guilty about doing that. Only the day before, he hadn't cared all that much about Alexander. Now he seemed to relate more to this particular wild thing than ever before. \"Sorry about that.\" Alexander shrugged. \"It's okay.\" Something hit Max right then. \"No one really listens to you, huh?\" \"Oh, you noticed.\" Alexander laughed a little. \"Yeah, I guess you're not used to that. Being a king and all.\" Except that I'm not. Max said what was on his mind. \"I really messed this place up.\" Alexander looked at him in a funny way. \"You're not…really a king…huh? You're just regular.\" This surprised Max a bit. He hadn't expected Alexander to figure that much out so soon. But after all that he'd gone through, he didn't feel like lying anymore. So he shook his head. Alexander sighed. \"I knew it.\" He stared at the wall. \"I don't even know if there is such a thing as a king that can do all the things you said.\" Max was a bit nervous about what Alexander would do now that he knew the truth. But when the goat continued to sit there, he became confused. Wasn't Alexander angry? \"Look,\" Alexander said. \"I don't care. Just…don't ever let Carol find out.\" Right. Carol. .......... That night, Max was allowed to sleep in the fort. He thought that maybe being back with the others would be a lot better than sleeping all by himself in the cold. He soon learned he was mistaken. Again. Poor Max kept waking up, but it wasn't because he himself was having bad dreams. Carol kept talking in his sleep, clawing at the ground in a ferocious way. \"Max…come here…king…\" he mumbled over and over, growling the whole time. Max inched away from where Carol lay and pressed against the wall. He was seriously thinking about making a run for it when he turned and saw that Bella was right behind him. He jumped and let out a yelp, but luckily he did not stir the others. \"I thought you weren't coming in here,\" Max said. Bella rolled her eyes. \"Unless I had to intervene.\" She pointed to where Carol was still grunting and clawing. \"And I'm guessing this is a very good reason to do so.\" Max nodded, yawning. \"You didn't have to do that…\" \"I don't care.\" She narrowed her eyes at Carol. \"He's not doing anything to you. I promise, Max.\" He didn't have time to tell her how much he hated that word. As soon as her arms came around him, he fell back asleep. .......... While he was sleeping, Max came up with a plan that could keep him safe. Unfortunately, he didn't have time to run it by Bella, because she had already left by the time he had woken up. So he had to put his plan into action alone. He found the perfect stick, and began to draw a rectangle in the side of the fort – Max-sized, of course. He was working on making the lines thicker when he noticed Carol walk in. \"Max,\" Carol said. The wild thing noticed the drawing on the wall. \"What's that?\" Max had been hoping to avoid this, but all he could do now was pray that Bella wasn't too far off. \"Um…well, I was thinking that we needed a place…where the king's secret…like a, like a secret chamber for the king.\" Carol was starting to look hurt, but Max could tell his friend wasn't grasping the whole concept. Which was good. Maybe. \"Well…I don't understand, what…?\" \"Well…you know, like…like a small place…with a door that's…not so big…\" This wasn't coming out right. He could tell. Carol's face told all. \"Whoa,\" Carol said after a moment. \"I didn't picture it with secret doors.\" Max hadn't, either. But if he wanted to save himself from potential harm, this was the only solution he could come up with. He just couldn't tell Carol that. He'd most likely hurt his feelings. \"What if it were a big place?\" Carol suggested hopefully. \"With big secret doors?\" \"Well…that's…that's not really…how it would be done,\" Max explained softly. \"It's more like…\" It didn't matter what Max was about to say. Carol's paw plunged into the side of the fort, creating a round hole. Max ducked as twigs and sticks flew overhead. \"About that big?\" Carol asked. He was holding back either a growl or a crying fit; whichever one it was, Max couldn't tell. He wouldn't find out, either. Carol stormed away before he did anything else, clearly upset. Max didn't need a secret door any longer. He sprinted out of the fort. What he needed now was something he never thought could be possible. He needed to find Bella. He needed to tell her what had happened. But more importantly, he needed to ask her something that had been burning him with interest ever since she'd arrived here. He wanted to know where his sister was.[Chapter 39] A/N: Bella (Max's sister) won't be showing up for a couple more chapters...LOL I'm giving her some time to rest and think about things. ........ Chapter Thirty-Five: I'm Done \"Bella!\" Max called. She wasn't anywhere he looked. She'd promised she would stay close by. So why wasn't she here? What could have made her disappear like this? He went back to the fort and knelt in front of his secret door. Now that he saw what it would look like, he couldn't believe he'd wanted it in the first place. Nevertheless, he climbed in and snuggled in the small space, happy for the momentary comfort it provided him. He found himself suddenly angry at Carol for making the hole. He had to overreact to everything, didn't he? Carol was so immature…so thickheaded… So…much like himself. He pushed the thought from his mind. Why had Carol come into the fort, anyway? Max was sure that everyone – save Alexander – still harbored harsh feelings for what he had done a few days before. Carol was probably coming in to tell him what a horrible job he'd done in ruling everyone. Now that he thought about it, Carol had seemed a bit disgruntled about something as he'd entered the fort. It could have easily been about what Max had done, but he had a feeling that whatever Carol was upset about was something completely different. That's when he remembered something. Climbing into the hole he'd seen a smear or two on the walls of the fort. He climbed out to see if he was right. There they were. He hadn't been seeing things. Bits of red streaks surrounded the hole. Bits of red … Max remembered seeing red covering Carol's claws. And that red certainly didn't look like finger paint. And although Carol could have clawed anyone on the island, Max was sure he knew who the victim had been. His stomach dropped. Oh no… He took off running, not knowing where he was headed, but knowing he needed to run. …… He finally found her sitting by the beach where Bob and Terry lived. She was wrapping cloth around one of her arms, and from where he stood, he saw that it was red. Just another thing he could chalk up to his wonderful way of ruling the island. But at the moment, all that mattered was that she was alive. He approached her, suddenly shy. \"Bella?\" He was out of breath from running. She jumped. \"Oh, hey, Max,\" she said quickly. \"What happened?\" She looked at her arm. \"Oh…this?\" She shrugged. \"I, um…was running really fast and I…smacked into a tree.\" She shrugged again. \"You know how clumsy vampires can be.\" Except vampires don't get hurt all that much. They can only bear injury if they're harmed by…by a Wild Thing. Max sat beside her. He wasn't sure if he should be happy or angry that she was trying to hide her wounded arm from him. She was putting on a brave face, something she'd been doing ever since she'd gotten here. He figured that someone else needed to stand in her place for a while. \"I know it was Carol.\" Bella glanced anxiously at him before sighing. \"He caught me sneaking around his secret hiding place. I found it by accident, but I figured it had to belong to him.\" She smiled for a moment. \"He's so much like you, Max. I see so much of you in him.\" Her smile faded as she went on. \"Anyway, I wanted to talk to him about possibly being friends. I hate the fact that he hates me. It puts a strain on everything. So I was looking through the desert and the rocky part of the island when I found his secret room. Then he arrived shortly after. I was afraid he'd catch me, so I hid. But he's got a great sense of smell, just like me. He knew I was in there, and…\" She paused. \"You can tell me,\" Max said, not sure he wanted to hear what happened next. \"Carol's got a very bad temper, Max. I'm sure you've noticed that.\" \"It's not exactly inconspicuous,\" Max admitted. \"I got to see it firsthand. He was livid with me. He thought you'd told me about it and that I'd gone there just to get on his nerves.\" She looked down at her arm. \"The next thing I knew, I was slammed into a wall and my arm was bleeding. He told me if he ever caught me there again…\" Max shook his head. \"You still think none of this is my fault?\" \"I don't have anything to say to that.\" \"Because you know it's my fault!\" She was so annoying when she did this. He could tell Bella was getting annoyed, too. \"Okay, you know what? I'm gonna come out and tell you exactly what I think.\" She stood up. \"Ever since you decided to lock me away, I've been extremely angry with you. All those storms and earthquakes…yes, they were your fault. Whenever you had a tantrum is when they happened. They destroyed everything. And it took forever to put everything right again. \"The worst part about it is that you just don't seem to care. You'll do whatever you want and not even stop to think about how everyone else feels! It's your fault that KW and Carol are fighting, it's your fault that everyone hates you, and it's your fault that I'm out of my comfort zone, trying to help you! EVERYTHING IS YOUR FAULT!\" Max was stunned. He didn't know if he should point out anything she'd done wrong. \"You know, I miss the way you used to be,\" Bella said, her voice softening. \"What happened to the Max who was always so friendly and loving?\" \"He…he grew up.\" He said it harshly, but inside, he knew it was the truth. Bella frowned at him. \"You think growing up means acting like a jerk?\" \"Well…what about you?\" Max asked. \"It's not like you're a perfect little Cullen! You nag me every day about what I need to do, what you think is the right thing. You think I'm the only one who doesn't care?\" \"You're the one who wanted to hear it!\" \"You didn't have to say yes!\" Max shot back. Bella heaved a frustrated sigh. \"You know what? This was a horrible idea. I think the best thing to do is for you to let me back into your Mind—\" \"What makes you think I want you back in there? So you can take over and become my Conscience and make me do the things you want? I don't think so.\" \"Fine.\" She looked down the beach. \"Then I guess I'm really leaving.\" \"Go ahead and leave. No one wants you here, anyway.\" That night when things went wrong came back to Max suddenly. He'd thought in his head that no one wanted his sister, Bella, there. \"Okay. I'm done. Goodbye, Max.\" She began to walk away. \"Wait!\" he said. He remembered he wanted to ask her something. She turned around. \"What?\" He saw that she was beginning to cry. \"I want to know where my sister is. My real sister.\" Bella glared at him. \"You really wanna know where she is? You tell me.\" \"What?\" \"Where do you think she is?\" \"Isn't…isn't she out looking for me?\" Max was confused. \"That's what you said, right?\" \"I wouldn't know. Her brain is asleep, and when she's asleep, my connection with her isn't that strong. So I have no idea where she is.\" Max figured she was at home, sleeping, not even worrying about him. \"The last time I could track where she was going, she was…sitting on a bench. So be happy at least one person cares enough to look for you.\" In a flash, she had turned around and used her vampire running abilities to disappear. Max stared after her for a long time. So it really was true. The real Bella was out looking for him. She was worried something bad would happen. She really did care about him. And even though he'd just had a huge falling-out with one of his best friends, he kept the knowledge that Bella still cared about him close, finding that it was enough to comfort him as he started to cry.[Chapter 40] Hola! Sorry I haven't been updating! You know me...I'm super busy at the end of the school year. XD So I'm trying my hardest to do what I can. This chapter was heavily influenced by that wonderful novel The Wild Things by our pal Dave Eggers. And, no, I'm not saying that sarcastically...it really was an awesome book and Dave Eggers is a freakin' amazing author. Anyway, the reason I based this off of the book was because I really liked his take on the part where Carol chases Max and KW hides him in her stomach. It was interesting to see Carol actually try to pull Max out of KW's stomach; it made the whole thing seem much more scary. And I also thought it was interesting when KW won't let Max out of her stomach and keeps saying he can live in there. Plus I didn't want to make this exactly like the movie, because that part is coming up next! ^-^ Sorry that was so long! Happy reading! ......... Chapter Thirty-Six: Losing Him Twice My Weird, Crazy Dream – Part VII As told in 1 st Person by Bella Carson So I'm about ready to fall back asleep, when guess what happens. THE FREAKING SUN DECIDES TO RISE RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT. And of course Carol isn't anywhere to be seen. Awesome. Well, Max and I know we're not gonna get anymore sleep, but I can tell that Max wants some time by himself. So I tell him to go off to wherever he was planning to go and that I'll catch up with him later. I'm not entirely confident with this decision, but I know it needs to happen. There's only so much of Bella that any one person can take. Now that I have all this free time to myself, I go to the beach to sit and think for a little bit. How had things gotten this way? Was there anything I could do to make things right again? These were the questions I'd asked myself a billion times, but that I still don't know the answers to. After a while, I give up and just stare at the waves lapping at the shore. Suddenly the sunlight goes a bit dim. At first I think the sun really is dying for real this time, and I'm about to start panicking when I notice what's blocking the sun: two identical birds, flying in a circle. They descend and land next to me, one on either side. They seem vaguely familiar. I remember that KW had told me about how she's friends with two birds – well, owls, if you want the specifics. What were their names again? Shawn and Sherri? No…Tom and Jerry? No…Don and Mary? No. Again. Was it…Bob and Terry? Yes! That was it! \"You guys are Bob and Terry, right?\" I ask. At the moment, I'm so distraught I don't even second guess talking out loud to a couple of owls. \"Meep!\" says one owl. \"Meep!\" says the other. \"I'll take that as a yes…\" I say. KW failed to mention that these things are obviously impossible to understand. So this should be fun. I try to figure out which one is Bob and which one is Terry. The bigger one on my right seems masculine, so I guess that it's Bob, leaving the smaller, petite one on my left to be Terry. I'm about to ask when I remember that all I'll hear is a bunch of hooting. What else did KW say about these things? Oh, right. They knew the answers to everything. I'm not sure what she meant by the term \"everything\", so I guess that it literally meant everything. And that's when I have a thought. Maybe I can ask Bob and Terry what to do about my situation. And if I try hard enough, maybe I can understand what they're saying. It's worth a shot. I mean, I have nothing to loose, really. \"Hey, can I ask you guys a question?\" \"Meep!\" says Bob. \"Meep!\" says Terry. \"What do you think I should do about…well…everything?\" \"Meep, meep, meep-meep!\" advises Bob. \"Meep, meep-meep, meep-meep meep!\" adds Terry. \"Um…thanks!\" I say. \"You guys really are smart.\" \"Meep!\" says Bob. \"Meep!\" says Terry. But I still have no idea what they've said. ……… Bob and Terry leave a few minutes later, and once again I'm sitting by myself, as confused as ever. I begin to blame my mother for the mess I'm in; soon I also blame Claire, then my dad, then Gary, then Tori, then Max, and finally myself. And as I'm playing the Blame Game in my head, I find something very curious. My family hasn't talked in a while. And I mean really talk. Like about our feelings and stuff. We haven't done that in a long time. Not since…the divorce. We've been kidding ourselves for long enough and pretending everything's peachy keen, when really we're all hurting inside and want to let our emotions out. We're all like shaken-up pop bottles, waiting for the perfect moment to explode. That's when I realize that Max already has. This is the moment I grasp what it is that I need to do – not only with my family back home, but also here on the island. I need to find everyone, and we all need to talk. Because it's only a matter of time before one of us can't take the pressure anymore and completely bursts apart. ……… Considering my luck with controlling my dreams, I'll bet you're guessing that I wasn't quick enough to stop the next pop bottle from…well, blowing his top. And your guess is right. Since I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep the night before, I fall asleep at the beach and wake up to see that the sun was low in the sky. I figure there's only about a few hours left of sunlight, so I decide to go back to the fort. That's when I get this awful feeling in my stomach. And what's worse is that it's even stronger because I'm a vampire. And, no, it's not that I'm starving like crazy (which I'm not, because vampires can go a long time without eating). It's that Max is in trouble. Yes, it's obvious that that's the most cliché thing that could happen in my dream, but it happens. So I turn on the vampire speed, suddenly frightened. ……… I first run toward the fort, because I think that that might be the site of the conflict. But as I draw nearer, I can hear deafening roars coming from the woods I'm running through, accompanied by whimpers and cries that are almost too quiet to hear. My worst fear is happening. Max is being pursued by one of the wild things. And I'm not even there to do anything about it. Since my human-half is freaking out like crazy, my vampire-half is having a hard time detecting where Max is. I'm running blindly through the trees, the only thing helping me are the roars and cries getting louder and louder. Go faster! I yell at myself. My feet are actually starting to hurt, something I'm not accustomed to. The roars are still ringing in my ears, but the whimpers are gone. That can't be a good sign. Up ahead is a clearing dotted with trees. I stop to rest momentarily, looking around wildly in the process. I will my vampire senses to find my brother, but my human instincts are going into overdrive, and my worry is overpowering something that would normally speed things up a little. Carol bursts through the brush. I should have known this had something to do with him. There was always something about him that didn't sit right with me. Right then I want to provoke him for real. I want to get back at him for all the times he called me names; I want to rip him limb from limb for injuring my arm (which, by the way, is still in a sling). I want him to pay for trying to harm Max. But the image of what happened last night with my arm hits home with my human-half, and I cower behind a tree instead. I watch in horror as Carol starts to climb a nearby tree, all the way up to a platform sitting at the top. I notice for the first time that KW is up on that platform, as well. \"Where is he?\" Carol demands, breathing heavily from his climb. \"I don't know,\" KW says. \"Don't play games with me, KW! You know where he is!\" \"I don't know!\" she repeats. Carol sniffs the air. \"I can smell him!\" He shoves KW toward the edge of the platform, but she comes back and shoves him. That's when I know what's happened. KW has eaten Max. She's turned against him, just like Carol. I don't want to accept this, but I can't deny it. Why else would Carol and KW be having a shoving match and Carol say something like, \"I can smell him\"? My anger simmers and boils, and my vampire-half suddenly takes over. Tears streak down my face, hot and angry. My brother is gone. He's dead. I'm never gonna see him again. This sends me over the edge. I let out a cry that contains all of my emotions: heartbreak, loss…and sheer anger. At that moment, I want to kill KW and Carol for childishly fighting over who gets to eat Max. They've ruined my life, so it's only fair that I ruin theirs in turn. I run to the tree, but it takes me a while to climb it. (Hey, I'm no good when it comes to climbing, and my arm is still sore; I mean, we can't all be Edward, can we?) When I get up there, KW and Carol are still pushing each other. \"Give him to me!\" Carol shouts. \"I don't have him!\" KW insists. \"I know you do!\" \"You don't know anything!\" Carol stops, and then the most ferocious glare I've ever seen runs across his face. He shoves KW so hard, she almost falls off the platform this time. I can't take it any longer. I heave myself onto the platform and grab a handful of Carol's fur. \"Get away from her!\" I shout, even though I'm seething with rage at KW. Carol turns around, focusing his glower on me. \"You helped, didn't you?\" he sneers. \"You know where he is!\" \"Yeah, I know where he is!\" I shoot back before I have time to think. \"KW ate him!\" Just from the way KW looks at me I can tell I might as well have kicked her in the face. But I guess my answer is good enough for Carol, because, quick as lightning, he takes his paw and shoves it down KW's throat. \" I know he's in there!\" he cries. KW struggles away from Carol, trying to get his claw out of her mouth. I pound on his back, trying to get him to stop. He stops and then turns to me. He picks me up effortlessly and drops me off the platform. I'm living one of my most feared nightmares, the one where I'm falling a long way, and right before I hit the ground, I wake up with a jerk, screaming. I'm determined not to get to the end. I reach out my good arm and hold onto a tree branch. I hang there as I strain to hear what else is going on up above me. My answer comes when Carol falls off the edge of the platform. Branches crack from under his weight as he clumsily smashes into them. I move inward and hug the trunk of the tree as he passes my branch, narrowly missing him as he crashes past. He eventually lands on his back on the ground, moaning in pain. I feel sorry for him, and part of me wants to help him. I'm about to when KW jumps off the platform and onto another tree, heading away from Carol. The memory of what she's done comes back, and I make the decision to follow her. ……… She finds another clearing, this one surrounded by trees and littered with pine needles. She sits on a log, trying to calm her breathing. \"He's gone,\" she says. \"You're okay now, Max.\" What? Why would she be talking to Max? He's…he's… KW sniffs the air. \"I know it's you, Bella,\" she says, a hint of coldness in her voice. I storm out from my position behind a tree, suddenly a bit shy. \"What have you done with him?\" I ask, tears threatening to spill over. \"If you took a moment to consider things, you'd know I'd never eat him.\" She spits the word \"eat\", making me unexpectedly shamefaced. \"I hid him in my stomach in order to save him from Carol.\" The pieces finally click together in my mind. I know KW is the most gentle of all the wild things, and that she would never try to hurt Max. While Max had been running from Carol, she had expertly hidden him in her stomach before Carol had gotten ahold of him, but Carol had guessed where he was. And I'd helped him. \"I'm sorry,\" I say, feeling absolutely awful. \"I didn't…I didn't know…\" KW holds up a paw to quiet me. \"Don't worry about it.\" She pauses for a minute, then says, \"Of course it's okay if you talk to her.\" I'm confused why she says this, but then I realize that Max is talking to her from inside her stomach. Sure enough, she motions me to come closer. \"Put your ear to my stomach,\" she says. I cautiously do so. \"Bella?\" comes a quiet voice. \"Max?\" I can't help the tears that flood from my eyes. \"I'm okay, Bella. KW saved me.\" \"I know she did,\" I say, feeling worse than ever. Max doesn't say any more, and I can tell from his shallow breathing that he's about ready to pass out. \"I can't breathe that well in here,\" Max says to KW. \"Can you get me out now?\" I pull my ear away and straighten, waiting for KW to pull Max out of her stomach. But she sits on the log, looking thoughtful. \"KW?\" Max calls. He's so loud I can hear him now. \"KW! Please get me out!\" She keeps sitting there, not doing anything. I find my anger welling up inside of me again. Why won't she get him out? He can't breathe in there! I turn on my vampire hearing so I can hear what he's saying. \"KW?\" he asks. \"Yes, Max?\" she answers tenderly. \"Can you please let me out? I need to leave.\" \"You don't have to leave, Max.\" I stare at her like, What? Are you insane? \"But I need to.\" \"But what if Carol decides to eat you again? I can't protect you if you're out in the open.\" I can see where KW is coming from, but Max could die in there. And I can't stand the thought of losing him again. \"KW, he needs to get out of there. He can't live in your stomach.\" \"He likes it in there,\" she persists. \"Don't you, Max?\" \"No, I don't,\" Max tells her. \"I need to get out.\" \"I can't let you go,\" KW says firmly. \"You have to,\" I say, my anger surfacing. \"You're gonna kill him!\" \"I am not!\" she says. \"He can live forever with me and not have to worry about being killed!\" \"I can't breathe in here,\" Max says again. \"But you can't go, Max. I love you too much.\" \"I have to go, KW,\" Max says sadly. KW looks at me. I want Max back so dreadfully that I can't help but let more tears run down my face. KW relents and puts her own paw down her throat. When it emerges, Max is at the other end, gasping for air and covered with slime. But I don't see a little boy coated with stomach goo, looking weaker than I've ever seen him before. I see a little boy who can survive anything. He sees me and tries to smile. I walk up to him and gently hug him, careful not to squeeze him too tightly. I sit next to him as KW smoothes out his matted hair. Max looks up at KW. \"Bella and I have to go home now,\" he says, his voice barely a whisper. Then he lays his head on my shoulder and falls asleep.[Chapter 41] Hey, everyone! I have good news and bad news. The good news: I have Internet access again because we got a brand-new computer! Yay! The bad news: it doesn't have Microsoft Word, and in order to install that, we have to pay a lot of money. So I downloaded the last chapter I typed from a USB key. I have other documents on my fanfic account, though, so I could just clear those out and use that free space for this story. Anyway, here's the new chapter! Hope it's not too depressing. I got the dialogue from the movie. Which I don't own. Oh! One more thing: If my OCs are taking up too much attention and hoggin the spotlight, just let me know. I have a tendency of doing that...so if it gets to be really annoying, just tell me. Enjoy! ... Chapter Thirty-Seven: No Way Out That night, Max was haunted by horrible nightmares. He kept waking up from images of terribly tall waves, ferociously sharp teeth, and malicious wild things. His breathing never calmed and his heart never rested. Right before he tried to fall asleep again for what seemed like the hundredth time, he heard a noise outside. He feigned sleep, opening his ears for the slightest movement. Footsteps filled the room, small and cautious. She was back. What a surprise. Part of him wanted to throw her out. He still wasn't over what had happened that day. She blamed him for everything, and some of it wasn't even his fault. But he knew her; without him, she was nothing, no more than a figment of his imagination. She needed him. Just like she thought he needed her. Go figure. Annoyed and tired, he let her enter, slightly hoping some of the wild things would wake up and attack, so that he wouldn't have to worry about her anymore. She lay beside him, and he kept his eyes shut, desperately trying to fall back asleep. He tried not to let her presence get past his tough exterior. It was difficult, because he kept seeing dancing unicorns and sailboats with legs… … \"Get out here!…Wake up!\" Max sleepily raised his head. For a minute, he thought someone had been shouting… \"Everybody wake up!\" Nope, it was real. And the funny thing was, whoever was shouting sounded just like… \"Carol?\" Douglas asked, somewhat delirious. \"Everybody get out here!\" Everyone else was waking up, and no one looked pleased. Judith was grumpy, no surprise; Ira looked confused; Alexander was back to his jittery ways; and the Bull…well, nobody ever knew what he was feeling, so he just stood there. Out of the corner of his eye, Max saw that Bella was no longer trying to conceal herself from everyone. She right out stood in between Alexander and Judith, looking genuinely troubled. \"Everybody wake up!\" \"What does he want?\" Judith asked, looking very cranky. \"Uh…\" Ira tried to answer, but he was too tired to finish. \"It's all wrong…\" Carol mumbled madly to himself, over and over. He glared at the opening of the fort. \"WAKE UP AND COME OUT HERE!\" \"Carol, what is it?\" Douglas asked, starting to become conscious. \"Everybody get out here!\" Carol commanded again. \"I can't even look at it!\" \"Carol, what's wrong?\" Douglas inquired. \"The fort!\" Carol said, as if Douglas should have known what he was talking about. \"What?\" \"We have to tear the fort down!\" \"Carol, I don't understand…\" \"It wasn't supposed to be like this!\" Carol stated. \"Ca rol …\" Douglas complained. Carol turned to look at Max. \"You said we were all gonna sleep together in a real pile. We haven't done that since the first night you came here. And now you want a secret room! And KW's gone for good!\" Max was awake now, and starting to become scared. \"And now, on top of that, I have to worry if the sun is gonna die!\" \"What?\" Douglas exchanged glances with the others, who looked just as perplexed. \"It didn't come up! Look! It's dead! It's not here!\" \"Judith…\" Alexander whimpered. \"Oh, my God,\" Ira said. Max couldn't let this happen. He couldn't let Carol's tantrum get beyond anyone's control. \"Carol, stop!\" he said, feeling next to powerless. \"It's not there! It's dead!\" \"Carol, you're scaring everybody!\" Including me. He thought that Bella had come up behind him, ready to intervene as she had promised. He didn't have time to tell her to back off, or to even notice that Bella wasn't near him; instead, she was cowering behind Judith. \"It's morning!\" Carol wasn't going to give up. \"The sun's not dead! It's just nighttime!\" Carol gave him the meanest glare he'd ever seen. \"I can't trust what you say,\" he said in a low voice. Max took a step back, shocked. \"Everything keeps changing.\" Carol turned to Douglas. \"Come on, Douglas, we're ripping it down.\" \"Carol, we're not ripping the fort down!\" Max told him. \"It was supposed to be a place where only the things you wanted to have happen would happen!\" he reminded Max. \"Come on , Douglas, do as I tell you!\" \"No!\" Max exclaimed. \"We all live here! Not just you!\" He wondered for a split-second why those words sounded so familiar. \"It's everybody's! Judith's and Ira's and everybody's!\" \"Oh, finally !\" Judith remarked. \"You were supposed to keep us safe!\" Carol yelled. \"You were supposed to take care of us! But you didn't! You let the bloodsucker back in! I'll bet she'll be eating every one of us at any moment!\" \"No, she won't! She wouldn't hurt anybody!\" \"You weren't supposed to let things like this happen, Max!\" \"Carol,\" Douglas said. Max didn't know what else to say. He felt tears perched on the edge of his eyes, teetering precariously, preparing their descent down his face. He hardly noticed Bella was done hiding and was now crouching protectively, baring her fangs at Carol for calling her names again. He hardly noticed that the others were now huddling together, almost making a protective barrier against Carol. This was something he had done to them. Another mistake he'd made. \"I'm sorry!\" Max said it to Carol, but meant it for the others, too. He felt simply awful. \"Carol!\" Douglas said a little louder, trying to get his friend's attention. \"That's not good enough!\" Carol said to Max. \"You're a terrible king!\" \"Carol!\" Douglas shouted above the noise. \"WHAT?\" Douglas looked sadly at his best friend. \"He's not our king.\" \"What?\" Carol repeated. Douglas…why are you doing this? Max was too dumbfounded to tell him to stop talking. \"There's no such thing as a king,\" Douglas explained. \"Don't say that,\" Carol said angrily. \"Don't you dare say that!\" The others began to mumble, just as surprised by the news. \"I should have listened to myself,\" Max heard Judith say. Max looked at Alexander. The smallest wild thing gave him sad eyes and an even sadder smile. \"He's just a boy pretending to be a wolf pretending to be a king,\" Douglas said. \"That's not true. Don't you say that!\" Carol warned. \"It's true, Carol.\" \"Douglas…\" This growl came from Bella, her teeth still showing. Both wild things ignored her. \"No! That's not true!\" Carol shouted. \"Look, I just went along with it because I knew how much you wanted it,\" Douglas continued. \"DON'T SAY THAT!\" Carol hollered, grabbing onto Douglas's arm. \"No, Carol! What are you doing? STOP!\" Max cried. His voice was drowned out by many voices crying out in unison. Nothing could prepare them for what they were about to see. With a mighty grunt, Carol pulled on Douglas's arm. It came off as easily as if he'd picked a dandelion. Sand came out of the hole that remained. OH MY GOD! Max screamed in his mind, his eyes growing huge. This wasn't happening. This couldn't be happening! \"Oh, Carol! That was my favorite arm!\" Douglas said, trying to stop the flow of sand. \"I didn't pull it off!\" Carol insisted. \"I was just holding onto it! You pulled away!\" He didn't want to believe he'd just done something that drastic. \"Carol, stop it!\" Max pleaded. Something seemed to sink into Carol's brain. \"You lied ?\" \"Carol, don't come any closer!\" Bella warned him, at this time protectively crouching over Max. \"I don't take orders from leeches!\" Carol said, pushing her over. She fell on her injured arm, but quickly sat up, breathing heavily from the pain and glaring at Carol. \"Not so powerful now!\" Carol taunted as Max saw painful tears roll down Bella's face. \" Stop it!\" Max cried, standing in front of her. \"You're hurting her!\" \"So? It doesn't matter! You lied about her, too, didn't you? She's not your sister! She's not a vampire! She's meaningless!\" \"Just stop, Carol! This isn't some sort of game of yours!\" \"Games? You think I'm playing games? You lied to me!\" \"You're out of control!\" Max echoed words he'd heard long ago. \"I'm not out of control!\" Carol's eyes were brimming with tears. \"You were supposed to take care of us! You promised!\" Max felt his breathing quicken, his mind frozen, not knowing what to do. \"I'LL EAT YOU UP!\" Carol roared loudly, raising his claws threateningly. Now he knew exactly what to do. He hurried away from the wild things, away from Bella, and away from Carol. It was the only thing that could keep him alive now.[Chapter 42] Hey, everyone! Sorry it's taking me so long to update my stories! I just got finished being a counselor at a theater camp, and that was SUPER draining! Plus I have summer reading...yuck! Anyway, I have three weeks off before I have to do another camp, so I figure this is a good time to catch up. This is the second half of the Carol-chasing-Max episode (the KW-eats-Max part). I happen to have read some negative comments about this part of the movie, and all of them say the same thing: Why in the bleep did Max hide in KW's stomach? That really makes sense: he escapes getting eaten by Carol by getting eaten by KW. This movie is stupid and gay, blah blah blah. This is what I say to them: IT'S A MOVIE! I think the ironic factor of Max hiding inside KW gives the movie more personality. It lets Max and KW have another cute little moment together. And, in my opinion, it's a take on the statement, \"I'll eat you up, I love you so.\" Oh, and Max's revelation about families: yes, I got it from the trailer of \"The Last Song\" (don't know if the movie's any good, but the book was AMAZING!) When I first watched it, I thought about how much it related to the message of this movie. And I was trying to find the perfect character to say it and the perfect time for said character to say it. And when I was typing this, I finally found the who and the when. Okay, enough of my rants about the movie. Here's the next chapter! Enjoy! ... \"Sometimes you have to be apart from people you love. But that doesn't mean you love them any less. Sometimes, it even makes you love them more.\" - The Last Song ... Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Revelation OhmyGodohmyGodOHMYGOD! Max pushed aside the low hanging branches of the forest trees, trying to adjust his eyes to the darkness. He could hear crashing not far behind him. He didn't know this forest all that well. At the moment, it didn't really matter. Whatever he ended up running into, it couldn't be worse than Carol. He couldn't recall why he was running from one of his best friends. The screams filling his ears - Were they Carol's? His own? Both combined? - were enough to erase his memory. He kept running, but Carol was faster than him. Soon, the wild thing would catch up, and Max would be eaten. \"Come back here, Max!\" Carol roared angrily. Max tripped, but quickly picked himself up. His side was starting to ache, but he pushed himself to keep going. He wasn't going to get eaten. Not now. \"MAX!\" He turned his head, fearful that he might see Carol. While watching behind him, he ran into something. As he fell over, he was afraid that he'd run into Carol. \"Come on!\" a female voice said urgently. Max looked up into the face of KW. Her hair was a mess and her fur was streaked with dirt, but there was no mistaking the alarmed look on her face. \"Come here!\" she said, exasperated. She pulled at his foot, and dragged him into the underbrush. Max was perfectly still, choosing not to fight. Carol's screams sounded closer by the minute. Max huddled closer to KW. \"Quick, get inside!\" she said, gesturing to her mouth. Max stared at her. What? \"Get in!\" she said hurriedly. \"Crawl inside my mouth! I'll hide you.\" Max wasn't sure he wanted to do that. He was already running from one wild thing's mouth. For a second, he wasn't sure what he wanted to do: face Carol or follow KW's instructions. Max had a revelation. KW was helping him. She wasn't going to hurt him - not on purpose, anyway. He kept telling himself that as her mouth opened wider and wider. It was dark inside, and all he could see were her sharp teeth. He hesitated. A growl reached his ears. He jumped into KW's mouth and slid down her throat. He let out a yelp of disgust. It was slimy in her stomach, and very hot. But at least he was safe. He noticed a raccoon sitting next to him, eating something. \"Hi, Richard,\" he said. \"MAX!\" Oh, no. Carol was here. Max tried to quiet his breathing and movements. \"Where is he?\" Carol asked quietly. The sound was muffled-sounding. \"I don't know.\" \"Where is he?\" Carol asked louder. \"I don't know!\" KW repeated. \"I can smell him!\" Silence. Max froze, trying not to breathe but finding that quite difficult, for there wasn't a lot of air inside KW's stomach. \"I just wanna talk to him!\" Carol said, breaking the silence. \"You're out of control!\" KW told him. \"I'm not out of control!\" Carol sounded as if he were sick of hearing that phrase. Max knew he himself was. \"You were gonna eat him!\" KW said tersley. \"No, no I wasn't...I wasn't going to...\" Carol stuttered. \"I don't know, I just said it!\" Silence again. Max wasn't sure what was happening now. \"Am I as bad as he says I am?\" Carol asked. Max felt his heart starting to split down the middle. Carol really sounded sorry for chasing him. \"Just go away,\" KW said. \"I just...wanted us all to be together.\" Muffled footsteps sounded outside, getting fainter and fainter. Max felt KW sitting down. \"Can you believe him?\" she asked, still angry. Max found his voice, which was small and weak. He wasn't sure if it was from being in KW's stomach or if it was from being scared. \"He doesn't mean to be that way, KW. He's just scared.\" KW sighed. \"Well, he only makes it harder. And...it's hard enough already.\" Max had a momentary flash-back to his own family. His workaholic mom, his conceited eldest sister, his sweet yet loud middle sister. And then him: wild and out of control. All different personalities living under the same roof. A lot of the times it was difficult to live with those three - and it didn't help that they were all girls. \"But...he loves you. You're his family.\" KW sighed again. \"It's hard being a family,\" she said simply. She's right. It's very hard. But...families fight sometimes. Or a lot of the time. And...sometimes we have to be apart from each other to figure things out. But that doesn't mean we love each other any less that we did before. Sometimes...it makes you miss them...and love them even more. For a moment, Max was stunned at this advice he'd given himself. He finally knew what needed to happen. But first things first. He was starting to pass out in here. \"I can't breathe that well,\" he said breathlessly. \"Can I come out now?\" She seemed to pause. But then he saw her claw reach down, and out he came. He started breathing heavily, thankful he finally had some oxygen in his lungs. She set him down next to her and started smoothing out his slime-covered hair. \"I wish you guys had a mom,\" he said quietly. Things were a lot easier with moms around, even if they were annoying sometimes. They smiled sadly at each other and didn't say anything for a minute. Then Max worked up the courage to tell her what he was going to do. \"Me and Bella are gonna go home now.\"[Chapter 43] We're getting closer to the end of the movie section of this fanfic! I know, it's kind of sad...but that means it gives me more room to express my creativity lol! About the first part of the chapter: After watching this movie for the billionth time, I wondered why Max never really \"made up\" with any of the other Wild Things (besides Carol). It kind of felt out-of-place, in a way. So I tried to formulate as best I could what conversation Max might have had with the others telling them how sorry he is for screwing up. ... Chapter Thirty-Nine: I'm Going Back Although he knew that leaving the island as soon as possible would be the best option, Max also felt that he owed the Wild Things an apology at least. After all that had happened because of him, he wanted them to know how sorry he was and how he wished he could take all the pain and suffering he caused them away. Even if they did hate him, he didn't want to leave them without tying loose ends. Everyone - save Carol and Bella - was sitting quietly in the fort when he and KW returned. They looked up when they heard footsteps, but didn't look away when they saw who it was. \"Um...hi,\" Max said. He was answered with silence. \"I just wanted to say...I'm sorry,\" Max said, tears threatening to pour from his eyes. \"I know I've said that a lot lately, but I'm sorry. For everything. It didn't turn out the way I thought it would.\" \"Ooh, shocking,\" Judith remarked. \"Judith,\" Douglas scolded. \"Let him talk.\" Max noticed for the first time that Douglas's right arm socket was now being occupied by a stick with three prongs on the end that looked like fingers. He nodded at Max to continue. \"I'm not a king. I'm not a superwolf. I'm just a regular boy...I'm me. And I know that compared to who you thought I was...well...Anyway, I just wanted to let you guys know that...I have to leave now.\" This caught everyone attention. They muttered among themselves, confused and surprised. \"Do you really have to?\" Alexander asked. \"Yes,\" Max told him. \"If I stay...there's no telling what else might happen. I seem to ruin everyplace I go. But maybe...maybe if I leave, I can have a part in putting things right again here.\" There was another silence. But this one was more stunned than the first. \"So, yeah. I, um, am leaving...and I really am sorry.\" He turned and exited the fort, taking deep breaths as he did. KW followed him. \"Thanks for that, Max.\" He turned. \"It was bad, wasn't it?\" \"No.\" She gave him a smile. \"I really think they needed to hear you say that. Coming from you, not from...the King or...you know.\" Max nodded. \"Well, there are a few things I still need to do before I leave.\" \"What's that?\" He looked beyond the rocks. \"I have to find Carol and Bella.\" ... Max breathed heavily as he ran through the desert. The sun wasn't very high, but it was hot, and Max desperately wanted to take his wolf suit off. (He didn't, however; underneath were his sweater and jeans, and he didn't see how much better it would be simply wearing those.) He climbed the rocks to Carol's secret place, hoping his friend was there. He'd looked everywhere else he could be, but it seemed as if Carol had taken off without leaving a trace behind. \"Carol!\" Max called as he entered. He felt his heart sink as he stared at his surroundings. Carol had been here, all right. The whole place was wrecked. Max tried to picture how it had been before: a scale-model of the perfect world, with tall mountains, waterways running through the roads, tunnels below. Now all that was in pieces. The mountains were cut in half, the water was drained, and dirt lay everywhere. The figures of the Wild Things were either smashed or broken. Max willed his feet to move through the damages, trying to find something that hadn't been destroyed. He had no such luck. Carol, why? Why did you do this? Max remembered the day he wrecked Claire's room. It hadn't looked as bad as this, but he had asked himself the same question: Why? Because of my temper. Because I was angry. Because Claire hurt me and I wanted to teach her a lesson. But it was only hurting myself more. Bella was right. He and Carol were a lot alike. Max thought some more about everything that had happened, and decided what he needed to do. He left something for Carol before leaving the once-safe place, hoping he could find the Wild Thing before he left. ... He was sitting with Douglas on a ledge overlooking the fort. They were talking about something. Max slowed down, cautiously walking up to them. He knew Douglas wasn't going to attack, but he wasn't so sure about Carol. The two of them watched as he approached. Carol looked dejected, and his eyes were red. Douglas stood up. \"Max.\" Max sat down, taking this as a cue that they were about to be left alone. \"Well...um...yeah.\" Douglas patted Carol on the shoulder. \"Yeah.\" Sure enough, Douglas walked away right then. Max and Carol sat in an uncomfortable silence for a minute before Carol broke it. \"So...whatever happened with you and the Vikings?\" He had almost forgotten about that story he'd fabricated. Max knew he had to appraoch this topic gently, because he didn't know if Carol was still angry. \"Well, in the end...I had to leave.\" \"Why?\" Carol looked at him, pleading him not to go. Max knew part of him didn't want to leave, but the other part told him he had to. He went on, forcing himself not to sound too sad. \"I'm not a Viking, or a King, or...or anything.\" \"So what are you then?\" He paused and looked up at Carol. \"I'm Max.\" Carol looked away. \"Well,\" he said, getting up and walking away. \"That isn't very much, is it?\" ... He wandered to the cliff in the woods, not very surprised that his sister's alter ego was sitting there already. She had her eyes closed as if she were meditating, and he tried not to make a sound. \"Hello, Max.\" He stopped midstep. He sat down and braced himself for a reprimanding that was sure to be brutal. She opened her eyes, not looking at him. She didn't say anything, so he assumed that he would be talking first. But she beat him to it. \"KW told me about what happened last night. I thought I was going to have a conniption.\" It looks like you already did. Max could tell from the black running down her face and her bloodshot eyes that she must have been hysterical. \"I would have followed him and made sure you didn't get hurt, but the others wouldn't let me. Douglas and I went through the Judith treatment-\" \"Judith?\" Max couldn't believe his ears. Bella finally turned to look at him. \"She's a lot more caring than we give her credit for. And, yes, she fixed both of us up, with help from Ira, Alex, and the Bull. After, I still wanted to go after you, but Judith said it wouldn't be smart. Carol's too unpredictable when he gets that way.\" You don't even know the half of it... \"So when morning came, I figured you were dead by then. So I ran off in the woods to be by myself. A few hours later, KW showed up and filled me in on what happened. She said you would come and find me and tell me what we were going to do. So here I've been most of the day, waiting for you.\" Max waited a moment as that soaked into his brain before he started. \"Bella...I'm sorry.\" Her mouth turned up at the corners a little. \"I know you are. And...I'm sorry, too.\" \"You don't have to be. I really screwed up. The Wild Things...I ruined their lives. I pretended to be something I'm not, just because of...\" He couldn't say it; he couldn't talk about his family yet without crying. Bella sighed. \"I shouldn't have expected as much as I did from you. I knew what was happening, but I didn't let it sink in. I was too busy holding a grudge against you for keeping me in your brain for so long.\" Max smiled. \"Well, if I had to sit in my brain for four years, I think I'd be the same way.\" They laughed, and Max knew that Bella was okay now. \"We're going home now, aren't we?\" she asked. \"It's the right thing to do,\" Max said. \"I can't be here any longer. And I...you were right the first day you were here. I've been homesick for a while now. I miss my mom and my sisters so much. But I wasn't about to admit that to myself.\" \"Bella must be worried sick,\" Bella said. \"I mean, she's been out in the cold, looking for you.\" Max shook his head. \"I can't believe her sometimes. She's so impulsive and she doesn't think. She could catch something if she's not careful.\" \"She sounds a lot like someone I know...\" Bella gave him a knowing look, and Max smiled. \"She's lived long enough with me,\" he said jokingly. \"So...you ready to go home, Max?\" Max looked out over the ocean, imagining his house and his family. \"Yeah. Definitely.\"[Chapter 44] Hey! This may sound like I'm on crack, but if the past few chapters haven't been good, you guys can seriously let me know! I don't bite. I've been working on a \"personal fic\" for The Last Airbender , and I've been around all that wooden dialogue for a while. So if I put some of that in my writing by mistake, you guys can tell me, and I'll fix it. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK! No one's been reviewing in a while... Oh, and a little information about this chapter: this is the final part of Bella's dream, intertwined with what happens on the island. Here's a key to help: STUFF IN ITALICS: What's going on in Bella's dream STUFF IN REGULAR TYPE: What's going on through the eyes of Max Oh, and the very end was inpirsed by The Lovely Bones . I don't own that. This was probably the hardest chapter to type. This part of the movie is always so bittersweet. It makes me cry! Enjoy! ... Chapter Forty: Fly Away Home My Weird, Crazy Dream - Part VIII As told in 1st Person by Bella Carson The next day, all the Wild Things are gathered on the beach, looking a little sad. And then it hits me. Max and I are really going home. And I notice, for the first time, how much I miss my mom and Claire and Tori and everyone back home. I notice how much I want to go back. I know Max feels the same way. He must be exhausted and ready to go back to the real world. But I can never be sure. My brother can choose to be unreadable when he wants to be. But by the way he's looking around at his friends and wishing he could stay, I know that inside, he really wants to go home. ... Max walked down the beach, closely followed by KW and Bella. The Wild Things were there: the Bull standing off by himself; Judith, Ira, and Alexander in a group; and Douglas preparing the boat for its journey. Max felt his chest clench with sadness. Saying goodbye was yet another thing he wasn't really good at. When he was little, he'd always cry; as he got older, it was became awkward, because he never knew what to say to anyone. Now he felt a strange sense of confidence welling within him. These beasts had taught him something about life. This time he was determined to do this right. ... I go around and give a quick hug to everyone. I didn't know them for very long, so I don't really know what to tell them except for the standard, \"Bye.\" Max takes longer than me; with each one, it's different. I smile as I head toward the boat. ... They walked by the Bull first. Max was going to nod in recognition when something surprising reached his ears. \"Hey...hey, Max.\" He looked up. The Bull had finally spoken. It was quiet and shy, not at all like he'd pictured it. \"When you go home,\" the Bull said, \"will you say good things about us?\" Now that he thought about it, this voice fit the Bull perfectly. Max smiled a little. \"Yeah,\" he told him. \"I will.\" \"Thanks, Max,\" the Bull said. Bella stared up at the Bull before startling him with a hug. \"I'm glad you finally talked,\" she said. Max then appraoched Ira, Judith, and Alexander. Ira was smiling, but Max could tell that he was trying not to cry. Max gave him a hug, burying his face in Ira's fur. \"You're the first king we haven't eaten,\" Judith said quietly. ( Yes, I know! She finally did it! ) \"Yeah,\" Alexander piped up. \"It's true.\" \"Thanks,\" Max said, although he was sure it wasn't audible. There was a pause. Max could feel the awkwardness, and groaned mentally. But Judith's voice cut through it. \"See ya,\" she said lightly. \"Bye, Max,\" Alexander said. \"Bye.\" Bella lagged behind to give each Wild Thing a hug. \"You know,\" Judith said. \"You're pretty cool. For a vampire.\" Bella smiled. \"Thank you.\" \"Thanks for not eating us,\" Ira chimed in. \"You're welcome.\" \"Bye, Bella.\" Her smile grew a little at his simple words. \"Bye, Alex.\" They continued their walk to the ocean. Douglas was standing by the boat, waiting for them. ... Carol growled, angry and confused. Why would Max just leave him like this? It wasn't fair. He walked through the remains of his model, coming to a stop. There, on the floor, was something he'd never seen before now. It was a pile of twigs arranged in the shape of a heart. And in the middle of the heart was the letter \"C\". For Carol. Carol sat down. Max had been here and left that for him. After all the terrible things Carol had done, Max was willing to remind Carol of the friendship they still had. Carol sobbed, clutching his head. Now Max was gone, and he couldn't tell him how sorry he was. Or...was he? ... Carol ran across the desert, hoping it wasn't too late. ... Douglas and KW push the boat into the water, lifting Max and me in as they do. I give each Wild Thing a hug, and then Max shakes hands with Douglas and shares an embrace with KW. Max looks up the beach, and I know he wishes Carol were here. ... Douglas, Ira, and KW pushed the sailboat into the water. Ira backed away, joining Alexander and Judith, who were hugging each other. The Bull continued to stand by himself. Max looked up the beach, hoping to see Carol. But the Wild Thing wasn't there. Max told himself not to be disappointed. He didn't blame Carol for not coming. But he still wished that he could see his friend one last time. KW lifted Max into the boat, Douglas doing the same for Bella. She gave Douglas a hug and told him thank you. KW's yellow eyes were filled with tears. \"Don't go, Max,\" she pleaded. \"I'll eat you up, I love you so.\" She hugged him, and they stayed like that for a few minutes. Finally, KW let him go, and Bella stepped forward. \"Thank you for saving him,\" she said, hugging KW. \"And for being so kind.\" Then KW pushed the boat, and it started to float away. ... The boat begins to drift out. Suddenly Carol comes around the bend. He wades into the water, giving Max and I one of the most heartbreaking looks I've ever seen. He begins to howl, and Max takes up his lead. The others and I follow. Then Max and I turn our backs on the island, setting sail for home. ... Max heard labored breathing on the shore. He jerked his head, and there was Carol. He ran all the way to the water, wading out leg deep. He was still crying, and he didn't say a word. But Max knew he didn't have to. Carol wanted him to stay. His tear-filled eyes told him that. As he began to cry himself, Max gave Carol a smile, full of sorrow and hope. Bella took one of his hands. Howling filled the air. It was coming from Carol. It was the sound of a life that would never return. Max joined his friend, quietly immitating his cries. He could hear Bella doing the same. Soon, the other six Wild Things added their voices, and the sound, although mournful, was weaved with light and the hope of better things. And even though the sound started to fade as the boat went further out, the chilling meaning was still strong. ... The ride back felt a lot faster than the initial. Maybe it was because Bella was with him. Maybe it was because they had so much to talk about. Maybe it was because Max was anxious to see his home and family again. Whatever the reason, Max saw lights in the distance one night, knowing it was his home. \"Look!\" he cried, pointing. \"We're back! We're home!\" He noticed that she didn't agree wit him. He turned to look at her, confused. \"Aren't you excited?\" \"I am excited,\" she said. \"For you.\" \"What do you mean?\" She laughed. \"Max, this isn't my home. My home is in here.\" She put a finger to Max's forehead. He had almost forgotten. She didn't really belong in this world. \"Can't you stay?\" he asked. He didn't want her to leave just yet. She had just broken free from his head. \"I think it would be best if I went back now,\" she said, a touch of sadness in her voice. \"My friends will be worried about me.\" Max looked at the bottom of the boat. \"Will you visit?\" \"Of course I will.\" She tossled his hair. \"As often as you want me to.\" He looked up at that and sighed. \"Okay.\" They sat for a moment, staring at each other. Then Max scurried to Bella and wrapped his arms around her. \"I'm going to miss you.\" He felt tears coming from his eyes. \"I'll miss you, too,\" she said. \"But I'm never far away. Remember that.\" After they let go, Bella gave him instructions about how to send her back. \"While I picture where I want to be, repeat over and over in your mind, 'Fly away home'.\" Max closed his eyes. Fly away home. Fly away home. Fly away home. A blinding light was in front of him. He squinted as Bella became a ball of sparks, zooming around the boat and finally going into his head. He felt his pupils dialate for a moment, and then grow to normal size. And when he turned around, he saw that he had reached the shore of the lake in the woods. ... You may think his journey's over now. Almost. But not quite. Max still has a few things left to do.[Chapter 45] Part of this was inspired by the \"Never Let Go\" scene in Titanic . Which I don't own. And I made this one long! It didn't start out like that, but it turned out that way. So you guys get an extra-long chapter! Enjoy! ... Chapter Forty-One: A Promise Kept Max hopped out of the boat and tore across the woods. He ducked under the hole in the fence and ran down the street, the winter air biting at his face. A neighborhood dog barked at him, and he barked back, happy that he was in his own neighborhood. He came to a halt. He wanted more than anything to go home. But he knew that someone else wanted to go home, also. And he was sure that this someone was still out there, freezing and worrying about him. He went off down a side street, following his instincts and hoping they were right. ... Bella slowly lifted her head off of her backpack. She gazed around, her mind weighed down by sleep. It almost looked like she was outside. That was weird. Because she was... Actually outside. Everything came rushing back to her. Her watch face stated that it was now 11:30. She shook her head and felt like crying. Things just couldn't work out for her, could they? She heard howling. It sounded like one of the neighbor's dogs. Whatever it was barking about, she didn't care. She wanted peace and quiet. \"Shut up,\" she mumbled. It grew louder and more annoying. \"Shut up,\" she said again. Now it sounded closer. \"God, SHUT UP!\" she shouted. But as she listened, it didn't sound like a dog. It sounded more like a person barking like a dog. And there was only one person who sounded just like that. \"No way,\" she said to herself as she got up from the bench. She looked down the street, and rounding the corner came a boy in a dirty wolf suit. \"MAX!\" Her head exploded into a thousand different thoughts at once; the one that was the loudest was telling her to run. And she did. Her boots flopped against the wet gravel as she raced toward him; her vision was blurring, but she kept going. He became clearer, closer, more real by the second. Bella had heard that sometimes life seemed to slow down, and things would happen in slow-motion, like in the movies. This is what it felt like. Everything around her stood out in stark contrast, and her movements decelerated. It ended soon enough. Her brother's arms were around her waist, and hers around his shoulders. Her chin rested on the crown of his head as she cried tears of joy. \"Thank goodness,\" she said. \"I've been looking all over for you!\" Max said nothing, but he clung tighter. \"How long have you been out here?\" \"I don't know...a few hours, I think. Mom and Gary were talking about how you had run out the door, and I got worried. So I snuck out to look for you.\" \"But...I know you hate the dark,\" Max said, pulling away and looking at the ground. \"And...and you hate me, too.\" Bella tilted his chin up so he was looking at her. \"Max, I'm sorry about what I said,\" she told him. \"I didn't mean it. I got frustrated. So very, very frustrated.\" She sighed. \"I know that things haven't been exactly, you know, great and all...but Dad once said that I can't give up, no matter how hopeless things get.\" Max's eyes widened. \"So, even though you were scared, you still kept at it?\" \"Of course I did! I knew I'd find you eventually.\" She paused. \"Remember when we were little? The night I slept in your room?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, I've told you: people get angry. I got angry with you tonight. But that doesn't mean I don't care. Things happen, and people lose their tempers. But I would never let something terrible happen to you.\" She kissed him on the forehead and held him close. \"I love you, Max.\" \"I love you, too, Bella,\" he said, hugging her back. Things right then seemed perfect. And they were. But, of course, life in Bella's world could never really be perfect. All the same, when she saw the car turn down the street, she felt like a deer caught in headlights - so to speak. \"No way...\" she said again. It was the same car, with the same mysterious guy. And she knew he'd be really ticked off now, considering the pepper spray and the water bottle. But now it was personal. She wasn't going to let this creep harm Max. \"Max,\" she whispered. \"I don't want you to panic.\" \"Huh?\" Max looked up at her. \"Keep calm, okay?\" She tried to keep a calm face herself. \"Just don't panic...\" \"What are you...?\" He saw the street was lit up, and he turned toward the lights. \"Max, we gotta run!\" She grabbed his wrist. \"Hey!\" the guy from the car called. \"Wait!\" \"Come on!\" They scampered off, Bella dragging Max down the street and Max struggling to keep up with her. The car's engine roared, and it followed them closely. Bella didn't have a shread of an idea where she was taking Max. But as long as it was far away from the crazy guy, she was up for anything. They ran down street after street, passed house after house, dodged car after car, and still he was after them. He was serious now. They were coming up to a four-way intersection. She could choose to go straight, or take a sharp left. She chose at the last possible minute, and almost fell over trying to round the corner. While trying to keep her balance, she felt that something wasn't right. She straightened up and turned. \"Bella!\" Max's eyes were widened by fear. When they were trying to turn the corner, the guy had caught up with them and reached out his hand to grab them. She had accidentally let go of Max's hand when she was fighting to maintain her balance, and the guy now had part of Max's wolf suit in his fist. \"Gotcha,\" the guy said meanly. \"Now, you're going to get in like a good girl, or Bugs Bunny here gets it.\" No. Not Max. I'll do whatever you want. Just...not Max. She walked toward the car. \"Bella, don't do it,\" Max pleaded. \"Max, I don't have a choice,\" she said. \"Yes, you do!\" He turned his head and bit the guy's arm. \"OW! YOU LITTLE MONSTER!\" he screamed, letting go of Max's fur. Max took Bella's hand again, and they went off down the street. \"What was with you?\" Max exclaimed, keeping up but running out of breath. \"You weren't gonna get in his car, were you?\" Bella shook her head. \"Max...I didn't know what to do. I panicked.\" \"You were gonna risk harming both of us just because you believed what some creepy guy tells you?\" \"Okay, okay, I get it! I shouldn't have done that. But...I've had run-ins with him already tonight and-\" \"You know him?\" \"Not really,\" she said. \"He's just some stalker guy trying to kidnap me or something. And now he's after you, too. I'm sorry. I should have been watching for him.\" \"Bella,\" Max said, \"I don't want to be rude, but can you please stop having a pity party for yourself right now? I accept your apology, but we've got more important things to worry about!\" The headlights illuminated their path. \"Oh, great!\" Bella muttered. \"Follow me,\" Max said, running through a yard. \"Max! What are you doing?\" \"Don't ask questions!\" the nine-year-old said. \"Just come on!\" Bella followed him through a number of successive yards before they came to a hole in a wire fence that faced the side of a house. \"What is this?\" Bella asked. Max shuffled his feet sheepishly. \"Well...some of the neighborhood kids made this. We sneak in here all the time to play tricks on Mrs. Dawson.\" Bella sighed. \"If we weren't running for our lives, I would be sooooo angry at you,\" Bella said as she climbed in after him. They crawled into some bushes that were against the wooden fence that separated the front yard from the back yard. There was a small hole, big enough for Bella and Max to look through if they took turns. \"See anything?\" Max asked. \"No...,\" Bella said. But she knew she'd spoken too soon as she saw approaching lights. \"Yes.\" The guy pulled his car up to the curb and slammed the door. \"I know you're there! And I'm not leaving until you come out. I'll wait all night, if I have to!\" Bella turned away from the hole and looked at Max. \"This guy is seriously bugging me.\" \"How did he find us?\" \"He's just weird like that, I guess.\" \"We can't stay here long,\" Max said. \"We gotta get home.\" \"I know. Maybe he was making it up. He's probably gonna leave in five minutes. Then we can go, okay?\" \"Alright,\" Max said. Bella checked her watch. It was 11:36. She planned to make it home by 11:45. And it was going to happen. ... 12:20 a.m. ... \"It's so cold out...\" Max said. He shivered violently, even with Bella's warm coat on. \"I know it is.\" Bella hugged herself, watching her breath float away on the night air. She peered through the hole. \"But he's still there. We can't leave until he does.\" \"Are we...ever...gonna...go back?\" \"Of...course we are,\" Bella said, her teeth chattering. Max snuggled closer to her. \"Bella, I'm...scared. He might...climb...over the...fence...and do...something. I...don't...want...to die.\" She was silent for a moment. Max decided that she was thinking about things. And he was right. \"Don't say that, Max,\" she said, her voice sharp. \"Don't say stuff like that. We're gonna make it out of this.\" \"I'm really cold...\" Bella blew into her hands and rubbed his arms. \"We're gonna make it. It's not gonna end like this. We're gonna go home in a second, and Mom's gonna be there, and tomorrow Claire's gonna be there. We are gonna make it home. It's not over. We can't lose hope. Not now.\" \"My toes feel numb,\" Max said, still shaking. \"It's so dark outside...what if he...\" \"Max!\" Bella snapped. He was taken aback, but then she took on a gentler tone. \"Please don't think like that. We have to think positive.\" \"But...\" \"Just do it for me,\" she said. \"Can you promise me that?\" Max looked to the side. \"I don't...\" \"Can you promise me something else, then?\" \"Okay.\" \"Promise me you won't do something this stupid again, all right? And if you do, you have to promise me that if things look really bad, that you won't give up without a fight. Even if things look completely hopeless.\" Max was slightly overwhelmed, but he found himself nodding nonetheless. \"Okay. I promise,\" he said, quivering. \"And...and never let go of your promise.\" He recognized those words immediately, and knew what to follow them up with. \"I'll never let go, Bella.\" She smiled, but it was quickly shattered. \"That's it!\" the guy said. \"I'm coming over!\" \"Max stay down!\" Bella whispered urgently. \"Don't let him see us!\" Max layed down on the cold, hard ground, trying to ignore the fact that he was colder than ever. He heard the fence begin to creak as the guy tried to climb over it, but he kept falling off. What kind of bad guy would be so incompetent that he would...? Oh. That kind. Max had figured out who this guy was. \"Bella, I know who that is,\" he said. \"What?\" \"I know who's chasing us. It's...\" \"Who's making all that racket?\" came a voice from inside the house. The lights turned on, and old Mrs. Dawson came out in her nightgown. \"Who's trespassing on my lawn at this hour?\" She went up to the guy and grabbed him by the collar. \"What do you think you're doing?\" \"There are kids,\" he said, sounding insane, \"behind your fence. They're hiding.\" \"It's not your job to chase kids out of my yard, it's mine!\" she said angrily. \"Patty?\" Mr. Dawson's voice floated out of the house. \"Who is that?\" \"Some riffraff claiming that there are kids hiding in our backyard again! As if those little punks would try something like that this late at night.\" \"You want me to get the shovel?\" Max stiffened. \"Sure, why not?\" \"I'm telling the truth! I swear!\" the guy insisted \"We'll see soon enough!\" Mrs. Dawson said. The rest of the block was starting to wake up from the commotion, and Max saw through the hole that there were a lot of people coming out of their house in their pajamas. \"Great, look what you did!\" Mrs. Dawson told the guy. \"Now you've woken up the entire neighborhood! I hope you're happy!\" \"They're distracted,\" Max said. \"Now would be a good time to leave,\" Bella said. Max led her quietly to the hole in the fence that faced the sidewalk. They slipped through and tiptoed down the dark street, finally running when they were far enough away. \"Okay,\" Bella said. \"That was seriously way too close.\" Max was too busy thinking to agree. \"I think I know where we are!\" he said excitedly. \"There's the park! We've only got two more blocks to go!\" \"Then let's go home,\" Bella said jokingly. \"Mom's gonna kill me when she figures out what we've been through tonight.\" They set off down the sidewalk, hand-in-hand, preparing themselves for what was to come when they finally made it home.[Chapter 46] This one is really short; sorry! I'll try to make the next one a bit longer. The idea for cream-of-mushroom soup came from The Wild Things by Dave Eggers. I don't own it. The idea that the chocolate cake was super yummy came from none other than Max Records's dad, stating that when they filmed this scene, he got to eat some of the cake and it was super good. So yeah. The chapter title: taken from Track 13 of the Where The Wild Things Are soundtrack. ... Chapter Forty-Two: Food Is Still Hot The lights were still on in their house. Mom must still be up , Bella thought. Max suddenly stopped. Bella turned around and smiled. \"It's okay, Max. I'm right here. Everything's okay.\" But was it? She had no idea how Connie was going to react to all this. First Max ran away, then Bella snuck out to find him. And then tomorrow she would learn about the thing with the creepy guy. \"Just take a deep breath,\" she said, squeezing his hand. \"We'll do this together.\" Her brother nodded, and they walked up the steps of the house. Max cracked the door open and poked his head inside. The front hall lights were on, but no one was there. The same was true for the kitchen. \"No one's here,\" Max said. \"Maybe she fell asleep,\" Bella whispered back. Max breathed out and stepped into the house, walking cautiously down the hallway. Bella followed, trying not to make a lot of clumping noises with her boots. They reached the end of the hall and peered into the living room. Just as Bella was about to sigh in frustration, the sound of a chair rubbing against the hardwood floor was heard. Max and Bella whipped their heads toward the sound. Connie came toward them and sank to her knees, grabbing her children and wrapping them in a tight hug. Bella stood motionless. There wasn't a hint of anger in her mother's actions. Instead, it was just relief. Sheer relief that they had finally come home safely. Connie let go and looked at Max. She slid the hood off of his head and hugged him again. Bella saw that Max didn't mind. He was simply happy to see her, happy to be back after a long night. Connie then turned her attention to her middle child. Bella shrugged, and Connie shook her head, letting out a cross between a laugh and a sob. \"Thank you,\" she said, hugging her. Bella brought her own arms around her mother, leaning her head on her shoulder and feeling like she was five years old again. Revisiting the time when the world seemed like a scary place, but things would turn out okay because Connie was her mother, and mothers knew everything. She and Max finally got their dinner. Connie had made them cream-of-mushroom soup - Max's favorite. Max gobbled it down; Bella took her time, even though her stomach was growling. While Max was shoveling the soup into his mouth, it began to dribble down his chiln. Bella giggled. \"Max, you need to slow down,\" she joked, wiping his face with a napkin. Connie watched the two of them sitting side-by-side and laughing. After they finished their soup, they each got a piece of chocolate cake and some milk. It was the best cake Bella had ever eaten. During this time, Connie had fallen asleep. Max watched for a moment, and then looked at Bella. They watched their mother silently. It was then that Bella decided that being apart of this family wasn't such a bad thing after all. They were all different, like the Wild Things in her dreams; but they put up with each other and helped each other, despite all that. She kept this in mind as she trudged up the stairs and got ready for bed. She was about to turn off the light when she figured that she should check on Max. She wanted to make sure he was still there; it was a stupid thing to worry about, but after that night's ordeal, she wasn't sure what to expect. He was sitting on his bed, in his pajamas, looking out the window. His wolfsuit and his clothes were on the floor in a heap. He looked up when she came in. \"I just wanted to make sure you were in bed,\" she told him. She sat on the edge of his bed, seeing for the first time how worn out he really was. \"Can...can you sing to me?\" he asked. She frowned. \"I don't know, Max...\" It was late, and she wanted to sleep. \"The song from the ship? Please?\" She blinked. \"I thought you didn't like that song.\" He beamed through his weariness. \"I changed my mind. I think it's nice. And...I really like it when you sing.\" She couldn't help but beam back at him, and sang the Love Theme for a while to calm him down. Eventually, she found herself laying down and closing her eyes and drifting off... ... The next morning, Connie awoke with a jerk. Her head had fallen out of the cradle of her arms and had hit the table. She looked around, delerious from sleep for a second. Then her eyes fell on the dishes laying in front of her. And she remembered. ... She walked up the stairs to Max's room and opened the door. She saw her children, sleeping soundly next to each other. She smiled, and shut the door behind her.[Chapter 47] Hola! I'm so sorry I haven't been updating! It's that dang voice inside my head…it keeps telling me that someone will hate my writing, and I get scared of it way too easily. But I'm back! I'm sorry if you guys thought that this was over…LOL I couldn't abandon it now! There are way too many loose ends I need to tie up! So, for the time being, that's pretty much what I'm gonna do: put in filler chapters to clean up some subplots I introduced a while back (which include show choir, the fight with Tori, and Bella's crush on Nick). If I get any more ideas after that, then I'll continue…but for right now, I think Max has had enough excitement for the time being. ;) Before I end this long author's note, I want to let you guys know that at one point, I was toying with killing off Bella. I know, I know...but I figured that her \"heaven\" would be the Wild Things island. But then when I thought about it, I realized I didn't want to write sad, sappy stuff like that. So Bella will live! She'll make it to the island, eventually…it just might take a while. As for my other Wild Things stories, they will be on hold for right now. Looking Glass requires me to get into the mind of a four-year-old, and I don't have the time to do that at the moment. Letters to Ronnie requires me to read a detailed summary of The Last Song (I read it over a year ago…I can't remember EVERYTHING) and to finally watch the movie. And, again, I'm on a time crunch. And with the added bonus of updating my new Harry Potter fanfic, I have to set priorities. I will say that Bella the Vampire will show up in here one more time…but I don't want to give too much away. I've already come up with the ending of Looking Glass…it's just those darned middle parts that are throwing me off! XD So…yeah. I'm all done with this note. LOL sorry it's so long! The next chapter should be up sometime later today! ~Elphie[Chapter 48] A/N: Just a quick reminder: if the police stuff isn't entirely accurate, then I apologize. I've never been to a police station before...XD Disclaimer: I don't own WTWTA...or some of what Gary says. LOL I just found out about the whole Jessi Slaughter thing...and I saw the \"Ya Dun Goofed\" videos. ;) Chapter 43: Facing Justice The late morning sunlight seeped through the blinds of Max's room. Max slowly sat up in his bed, feeling exhausted and sore all over. His mind hadn't quite woken up yet, and he got out of bed and padded down the stairs; he wondered what was for breakfast. He reached the kitchen, and in the process of yawning, he was attacked. His body went stiff; what was this thing that was trying to eat him? He wanted to fight back, but his limbs were still heavy with sleep. As he finally succumbed to his attacker, he realized that it wasn't trying to attack him at all. It was giving him a hug. The reason he'd thought it was trying to hurt him was because this person hadn't given him a hug in a long time. Max shifted his head to look into the tearful blue eyes of his attacker. \"Hi, Claire.\" The kitchen was devoid of voices. Connie busied herself with rearranging the contents on the counter for the umpteenth time; Claire stared at her empty bowl of cereal; Bella nervously picked at her waffles; and Max struggled to stay awake, nodding off every few minutes. \"What were you thinking?\" Claire finally snapped, looking at Bella. \"Do you know how dangerous it is out on the streets?\" Bella didn't say anything. She poured more syrup on her waffles. \"You're lucky you didn't get hurt. Or kidnapped,\" Claire continued. \"Claire,\" Connie said. \"I think she gets it.\" \"But Mom! They could have been in serious danger! And why didn't you tell me about this sooner? I would have left Dana's and come back home!\" \"Well, to tell you the truth, neither of you girls was supposed to know, but one of you has ears like an elephant.\" She winked at Bella, who smiled a little. \"How long were you out there for?\" Claire asked. Bella shrugged. \"A few hours…maybe four or five?\" Claire exhaled, but didn't say a thing. \"And you're lucky frostnip is the least of your worries,\" Connie said, eyeing Bella's red-tipped ears. \"Some people get hypothermia in that kind of weather.\" \"I know,\" Bella said, getting up to blow her nose. She knew that she at least had a 24-hour cold, and that she probably couldn't leave the house today. Not that she wanted to, anyway. Last night had made her realize how much her family meant to her; she wasn't ready to leave them just yet. \"Frosty the Snowman? Whaaaaa…\" Max sat up, blinking rapidly. \"Sweetheart, why don't you go back to bed.\" Connie kissed her youngest on the forehead. \"You had a rough night.\" \"I'm fine, Mom,\" Max said sleepily, yawning through his words. \"I don't need to sleep.\" Before Connie could say anything else, the phone rang. Stumpy came flying up the basement stairs, yapping at Connie's heals. \"Do you honestly have to do that every time?\" she asked, nudging him aside with her foot. Stumpy quickly turned his attention to the kitchen table, seeing the food that sat there. \"Hello? Yes, this is she…Uh-huh…Uh-huh…\" Her brow furrowed as the conversation went on. Bella cocked her head, curious. \"No, you have the wrong man,\" she insisted. \"He would never…I see…yes, but…okay…alright…I'll be down there in ten minutes. Thank you.\" She set the phone back in its cradle and put her face in her hands. \"Who was that?\" Claire asked. \"The police station.\" Connie looked at her children sadly. \"Gary's been arrested.\" Max looked more awake now, for some reason. \"What'd he do?\" Claire asked, sniggering. \"It's not funny! Mrs. Dawson from a few streets down claims he was trying to catch some nonexistent kids whom he claimed were hiding out in her backyard. The whole block was woken up by the racket he was causing.\" Connie shook her head. \"I have to go talk to the police. And they want Bella and Max to come with me.\" Bella's blood ran cold. \"Why do they want us?\" Connie sighed heavily. \"Gary claims that you were the ones he was chasing.\" Bella and Max were allowed to stay in their pajamas. They sat in a waiting room, where Max fell asleep. Bella, too fidgety to do the same, read an outdated People magazine. \"Isabella and Max Carson?\" She stood hesitantly, looking to where Max was still sleeping. \"Max,\" she whispered, nudging him slightly. \"Come on, Max.\" He jerked awake. \"Huh? What?\" \"They're ready for us,\" she said, holding out an unsteady hand. He took it, and she was glad she wasn't going back alone. \"Follow me,\" the woman said, smiling warmly. \"We just want to ask you two a few questions.\" Bella nodded, and she and her brother followed her to a grayish room with a folding table and a few chairs surrounding it. Bella and Max sat on one side of the table, and the woman sat on the other. \"Do you two know Gary Furnester?\" They nodded. \"He's our mother's boyfriend,\" Bella said. \"Was he at your house last night?\" They nodded again. \"What time did you leave the house?\" Max frowned, and Bella decided to answer again. \"I think he left around seven…and I left a half-hour later.\" The woman nodded, writing it down. \"Did you know that Mr. Furnester went out to look for you two?\" Bella raised her eyebrows. \"No…I didn't.\" The woman nodded. \"Is it true that you were approached several times by Mr. Furnester last night?\" Bella shook her head. \"I don't know if it was him…it was someone, but I'm not sure…\" \"Mr. Furnester says you sprayed him with pepper spray, kicked him in the shin, and…threw a water bottle at his head.\" Bella's mind was whirring. Gary was the creepy guy who had wanted to hurt her? She didn't know whether to laugh in relief or freeze in terror. \"Yes…yes, I did those things, but I wasn't aware that it was him. And it was in self-defense! He tried to pull me into his car, and I didn't know who it was, and he wouldn't tell me his name, and…and…\" She trailed off, tears forming in her eyes. \"Take a deep breath,\" the woman said, her eyes kind. \"It's okay.\" Bella composed herself. The woman looked down at her clipboard. \"Did you and your brother hide in Mrs. Patricia Dawson's backyard last night at around 11:30?\" Bella nodded. \"Yes.\" \"And how long were you there for?\" \"About an hour.\" \"Did Mrs. Dawson discover you?\" \"No.\" \"What was your purpose of being there?\" \"He was chasing us, for crying out loud!\" Bella didn't like the woman's tone of voice at the last question. \"It was the dead of night; we were panicking and didn't know what to do!\" \"Calm down, miss…\" Bella sighed. \"Sorry.\" \"It's okay, miss.\" The woman stood up. \"I'd like you two to come over to the window.\" Bella shook Max, who was asleep again, and the two went over to a window on the far side of the wall. It looked into a smaller room, and sitting right up against the glass on the other side was Gary himself. His eyes grew when he saw them. \"You bunch of lying, no-good punks!\" he screeched. \"I'll kill you! You ruined my life, you hear?\" Bella took a step backward, holding Max to her. \"What's the matter, Little Philly? Scared that Bugs Bunny's gonna run away again?\" he sneered. \"Do you recognize him as the man who attacked you?\" the woman asked, not paying any attention to Gary. Bella nodded immediately. \"Yes. It was him.\" \"You little brat! As soon as I'm out of jail, I'll get you! Consequences will never be the same!\" Two police officers appeared, and led Gary, who continued to shout and struggle, out of the room. Bella didn't relax her hold on Max. \"That will be all, miss,\" the woman said. \"You may show yourself out.\" \"Mrs. Dawson won't be pressing any charges,\" Connie said on the ride home. \"She said that usually, she would put up a restraining order, but under the circumstances, she'll let you slide.\" Bella sighed. \"Mom?\" \"Yes, sweetie?\" \"What's gonna happen to…?\" Connie stared straight ahead, silent for a minute. \"He's being sentenced to five years in prison for attempted child abuse, as well as trespassing on private property and disturbing the peace.\" Bella nodded. At least she had five years before… \"He said he was gonna kill us,\" Max said from the backseat. \"He thinks it's all our faults.\" \"Don't think that for a second,\" Connie said furiously. \"He's a jerk, is what he is. Making death threats to children and trying to hurt you…\" Bella could see that she was choking up. \"I'm so sorry. I should have realized sooner what a horrible boyfriend he was…\" \"Mom…I don't think anyone say it coming.\" Bella put a hand on her mother's shoulder. \"It's okay.\" Connie sighed again and smiled at Bella. \"I guess I should look on the bright side: he can't sue us.\"[Chapter 49] Chapter 44: Making Amends and Saying Goodbye She should have known, living in a semi-small suburban town, that news would travel fast and that she'd get her 15 minutes of fame. She just hadn't expected it like this. About an hour after arriving home, four local channels practically knocked down the door, all demanding interviews. Connie, hesitant at first, finally consented; Bella was sure she said yes just to get all the people out of their house. Even after that, they still weren't left alone. The local news stations must have wanted their story very, very badly, because all the interviews aired on the 6 o'clock news. The phone kept ringing, and Bella started getting texts from her friends, and people she didn't even know. Tori was the only person she didn't hear from. Bella blinked as she sat on the window seat. What had started that stupid fight, anyway? It must have been something petty, or otherwise she'd be able to remember. She opened her phone and selected \"New Txt Message\". IzzyB13: Meet me at the playground tomorrow at 12. I want to talk. Bella didn't expect a reply back. And she didn't get one. It was 11:50 the next morning. She walked down the stairs and grabbed her coat. \"I'm going for a walk,\" she called over her shoulder. \"Don't be long,\" Connie answered from the living room. Bella smiled ruefully as she shut the door and began to walk down the street. Her mother hadn't tried at all to make Bella or Max talk about what had happened Friday night – at least, not yet. That was the nice thing about Connie: even though she nagged a lot, she knew when you needed your space to sort things out. Only…what exactly did she need to sort out? Well, for one, she wanted to tell her mom that she wanted to talk things out from now on, and not go around pretending everything was fine. And she wanted to patch things up with Claire; her older sister would be off to college in less than a year. And with Max, she didn't even know where to begin. She supposed she, like Connie and Claire, wanted to know the obvious: where he'd been last night. But she also wanted him to know, to really know, that she loved him. He was under the impression that getting mad at someone equaled not liking them anymore. She needed to tell him that it was normal…most of the time. It was 12:02. Why was she even bothering? Tori wasn't going to show up. She was still angry, and they'd never be friends again. Bella sighed, watching her breath make a puff of steam in front of her. \"You just can't stay away from the cold, can you?\" Bella turned. Tori was standing over her, a wry smile on her face. \"You came.\" Tori nodded. \"I was worried, I guess you could say.\" She sat down, and the two of them sat in silence. \"I'm sorry,\" Bella said. \"I didn't mean…\" Tori smiled. \"Apology accepted. I appreciate you worrying about me, but I'm not five years old. I can make my own decisions – whether or not they hurt me.\" Bella sniffed. \"I get it from my mom.\" Tori rolled her eyes before pulling her into a hug. \"That's why you're my best friend.\" After they pulled apart, Tori looked at her seriously. \"I saw the news last night.\" Bella exhaled. \"I'm pretty sure the whole state did.\" \"Well, what you did wasn't smart…but the Bella I know sometimes does that kind of thing.\" Tori giggled. \"I'm just glad you're okay. God, I can't even imagine…\" \"Trust me…it was scary,\" Bella said, shaking her head. \"I think my mom's gonna confine me to the house until I graduate.\" Tori got a mischievous look in her eyes. \"You think I could smuggle you to Starbucks for lunch without her knowing?\" Bella pretended to consider. \"I did find twenty bucks in my coat pocket the other day…\" The two girls laughed and made their way up the street. Early afternoon that same day, Max sat on one of the swings, watching Stumpy chase his tail. He was still feeling overwhelmed by everything, but at the same time, he felt strangely calm. His mom wasn't asking about what had happened Friday, and he was glad. He wasn't ready to tell her – or anyone else – about the Wild Things. He still needed to readjust back into his life; he knew things were going to be a whole lot different now. And, after his trip to the police station and being on the news, he wanted to lay low for a while. He half-expected to be bombarded by his classmates when he went back to school on Tuesday (Connie was allowing him and Bella to stay home tomorrow). As he rocked in his seat, he thought he heard something. Stumpy had stopped running and was now sitting quite still, ears cocked. \"Hello, Max.\" Max turned to see Bella the Vampire sitting in the next swing. She looked exactly the same, only…she looked sad. \"Hey.\" He was a little puzzled at seeing her. He hadn't been thinking of her at that moment… \"Max…\" He could see she was trying not to cry. \"I have to talk to you about something.\" Max shrugged, trying not to freak out at the way she was behaving. \"Okay.\" \"I'm not your Imaginary Friend anymore, Max.\" Max frowned. Well, of course she wasn't…he was too old for that. \"So?\" he asked. \"So that means…I can't visit anymore.\" Max blinked. \"I don't understand what you're…\" \"Max. You've grown out of me.\" The full-force of what she said finally hit him. Sure, he was older, but it didn't mean he couldn't have an Imaginary Friend…did it? \"Being on the island made me realize how much you've grown up,\" Bella said, trying to talk through her tears. \"Your brain knows that you're older now, and…well…you don't need me.\" \"What?\" Max jumped off the swing, staring at her. \"No! I still need you! You're…you're my best friend.\" She tried to smile through her tears. \"Max…I'm not your best friend. The Wild Things taught you to rely on your family more, to understand them better and grow closer to them. And…that's why you've grown out of me. You're at that age where you need real friends.\" \"But…what happens to you?\" Bella shook her head. \"I don't know.\" He threw his arms around her. \"Don't go, Bella. Please?\" She hugged him, tears flowing from her eyes. \"Max, I wish I could stay. But I don't have a choice.\" Max realized that what she said was true. He could almost feel his matured mind; he wished that it would go back to when it still needed her. But, at the same time, he knew it was best. He really did need real friends…someone other than a person he'd created. He needed to live in the real world. Even if the real world didn't include Bella the Vampire. \"I'll miss you, Max,\" Bella said, kissing him on the forehead. \"Thank you for everything.\" \"I'll miss you, too,\" Max said, feeling his own tears burning his eyes. \"Goodbye, Max.\" \"Bye.\" She stood still, and suddenly she was enveloped in a white light. It flew towards his forehead, and once again, he could feel his pupils dilate. Once his vision adjusted, he knew for certain that she was gone. He couldn't seem to for what she looked like in his mind. He sat on the woodchips, letting himself cry. Stumpy came over and sat next to him licking his hand in consolation. \"Max?\" Bella walked over to him, her face pale. \"What just…what were you…who was that?\" The words didn't sink in at first. \"Who?\" \"There was a girl with you,\" Bella said shakily. \"She kind of looked like a cross between me and Claire. And then she exploded in a white light and…\" She hugged him. \"What the heck happened?\" Max frowned. \"How did you see that? I'm the only one who can see Bella the Vampire.\" \"That was…\" Bella trailed off. \"Then…how…?\" Max didn't want to talk anymore. He wanted to crawl in bed and stay there for a while. \"Can we just go home? Please?\" Bella nodded. \"That sounds good.\" The two siblings slowly made their way home, Stumpy trailing behind them.[Chapter 50] Hey, everyone!
