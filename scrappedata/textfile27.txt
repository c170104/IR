Sabía lo que significaba: Una nueva muñeca, una nueva víctima. Con cada sonido no perdía la esperanza, quizás un día…Así es que hice el intento. Mi puesto en la tienda es en el suelo, pero con mis constantes intentos fallidos de huída solo he logrado caer y terminar en posiciones extrañas e incómodas como la de hoy, recostado sobre el costado izquierdo de mi cuerpo y con ese transporte que se ha convertido en un nuevo miembro. Por eso la única forma que tengo de llamar la atención de esa niña es pedaleando para emitir algún sonido. Por eso, hoy pedalee como nunca. Pero las niñas son bobas, creen que una muñeca es una muñeca solamente y no se detienen a pensar, solo contemplan el espectáculo. Cuando me puso en pie intenté salir por la puerta, pero una vez más ella me la cerró. A ella solo la vemos funcionar cuando aparece un niño o niña solitaria fuera. Crea esas muñecas idénticas y abre sus puertas para nunca más dejarlas salir. Me pregunto si algún día será distinto. ¿Quién es? ¿Por qué lo hace? En estos años que llevo como muñeco he podido acercarme a la respuesta. Todos los meses entra un adulto a la tienda, toma unas muñecas y se va. Entra de noche, la tienda lo espera y abre sus puertas, y pareciera que se trata de una mujer, pero la verdad no lo sé. Luego limpia algunos nombres de la muralla frente a la tienda y se va. Escuché un estruendo. Al mirar vi que la nueva niña que ya había caído en la trampa, logró lo imposible: moverse. Yacía en el suelo y no dejaba de sacudirse, sin lograr mover algún miembro específico. En ese momento entró una niña pelirroja de chaqueta floreada. ¡Era mi oportunidad! Pedalee, pero fue en vano. La puerta se había ya cerrado. Entonces la niña tomó la muñeca del suelo y la colocó en una repisa y fue en ese preciso instante cuando llegó ella. Era una mujer bellísima. En su cara se notaba asombro. Y exclamó gritando -\"¡No la toques!, ¡Susy no te acerques a la muñeca!\" Ya era tarde, había tocado su muñeca, ella era ahora la muñeca. La mujer lloraba y gritaba. -\"¡Ya no más, no trabajaré más para ti, no hay nada, no tengo nada con lo que puedas amenazarme, soy libre. Si me quieres, devuélvemela!\" Entonces supe la forma de escapar. La tienda tembló, surgió del suelo abierto una mesa, llena de frascos con muñecos pequeños. La mujer tomó uno, lo abrió y la muñeca Susy fue adquiriendo movilidad y rasgos físicos. Sentí entonces más cerca que nunca mi libertad\" ","Summary":" \"Estaba sobre mi triciclo, del que ya sabía yo que no podría despegarme jamás, cuando escuché ese "},{"Movie":"十全九美","Title":"Rise of the Guardians in training","Author":"Stardustlover","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11467687","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 \"What are you doing?\" asked Carla, flying over to where Frances was. \"Practicing how to wrap presents.\" She said looking up from her work. \"BORING!\" said Carla rolling her eyes. \"No one ever those anything fun around here.\" As she said this, Carla leaned on the wall. Frances giggled. Jenna passed past them, struggling with some tooth boxes her mother, the Tooth fairy had sent her. \"Well, we all have to practice for when we become our parents. I, for example, have to start practicing how to fly, or else I won't be able to pick children's teeth.\" she said fluttering her wings. \"And I,\" Said Frances. \"I have to practice wrapping presents, or else I won't be able to wrap them in time for Christmas. She paused looked around and stopped on Clover. Still looking at him Frances stood up and walked toward him. \"What are you doing, Clover?\" she asked. Without looking Clover said something so low, that even Frances dint herd him. \"What? said Carla, putting her staff over her shoulders. Clover sighed and stood up. \"I said that I'm working on my egg painting skills. Easter is just a week from now and I want to help my father with the egg painting.\" He folded his hand as if it had been obvious. \"Oh, okay!\" said Carla who was now floating in the air as is she was lying down. \"Carla, aren't you supposed to be practicing?\" asked Jenna looking up. The others looked at her to. \"Practice what? My father just throws snowballs and have fun all day. I wish I could be with him.\" Carla let out a sigh. \"Being a guardian in training is soooo boring.\" Her voice sounded really whiny. Frances, Jenna and Clover looked at each other. Then, back at her. \"What?\" she asked looking suspicious. \"Nothing!\" they all said at once. Then they cracked up. The next day, when Carla woke up, the first thing she saw was he father's face. \"Dad, what are you doing here?\" she cried as she ran next to him. \"Nothing. Just checking on my kiddo.\" Her father said. But Carla knew him to well. \"Dad?...\" she said, raisin her eyebrows. Her dad laughed and threw a snowball at her. \"Just kidding!\" he said, \"I'm actually here to take you and your friends on vacation. In honor of my little girl's 15th birthday!\" Carla had forgotten all about her birthday. Just then, her friends walked in the room. \"Hey, why is it so cold in here?\" asked Frances shivering. \"What are you talking about? Carla and her dad said at the same time. When Jenna saw Carla's dad, she giggled. \"That explains it! Hello Mr. Frost. Bringing the cold weather I see.\" As she said that, she started pouring coffee in her mug. Carla's dad looked confused. \"What is she talking about?\" he asked Carla. Carla just shrugged her shoulders. Frances took Jenna aside. \"He and Carla are used to the cold, remember? They can't feel it, so please don't mention the cold in front of them.\" She snapped. Jenna nodded. The vacation day took forever to come. Carla could not sit still one second. \"Aren't you going to pack your bathing suit, Carla?\" asked Jenna, taking out hers. \"Cant. If I go in the water, I'll freeze it.\" Carla responded, doing a double loop in the air. Frances elbowed Jenna in the ribs. \"Ow!

La naturaleza de la vida dice que como humanos vivimos un proceso que no se termina si no que mas bien se completa y que debemos ser capaces de aceptarlo... Aunque esto suene atractivo y lógico es lo mas difícil de llevar a cabo. Un mundo perfecto con una duración limitada. Una lucha sin sentido en la que la impotencia sencillamente gana. Park Chanyeol esta perdido, está lleno de un miedo que desconoce y sin saberlo todo ello le a llevado a que pierda las esperanzas. Bueno, al menos así lo era. Las cosas empiezan a cambiar un 2 de octubre cuando un cabellera color chocolate y unos ojos tan brillantes como las estrellas ... Le sonríe. Eran las 7:15 cuando tomé el tren hacia hongdae. . . . Desperté muy temprano en la mañana con todo el peso de un nuevo día sobre mis hombros. Ayer, cuando caminaba con kyungsoo escuché a unas personas hablar sobre la muerte inesperada de un millonario a el que llamaban \"junmyeon\" y al parecer hoy seria su funeral. Debo ir, es mi necesidad amorfa, aun, si kyungsoo insiste en que no lo haga. Tomé mi gran abrigo negro y las llaves, cuando salí de mi habitación me encontré con un espacio en blanco, un hogar vació; no es que no hubiesen personas, solo, que no eran las correctas. La nostalgia y una foto familiar querían atraparme en la puerta, me miraban con sus ojos asesinos buscando hacerme pedazos como siempre. No lloré, solo salí corriendo de ese lugar. . . . \"El tren con destino a hongdae, llegará en 5 minutos, gracias por su paciencia\" Les juro por el cielo y sus habitantes que no hay nada mas molesto que la voz chillona de esa chica de la estación, claro, por un lado agradecía que ya podría irme, pero sinceramente seria mejor que el tren no llegase y que ella no tuviese que decir lo obvio. Al acercarme a la salida de espera, noté un gran franja amarilla pintada perfectamente por sobre el asfalto. No vayan a creer que soy alguien infantil, pero sentí tanto miedo que retrocedí hasta chocar mi espalda con cualquier cosa. El tren es el único transporte que puedo tomar, me gusta observar los carriles de cerca e incluso caminar un poco sobre ellos, pero aquella linea hacia conmigo lo mismo que hace la nostalgia y la gran foto en la sala. Me ponían limites, me hacían pedazos. No la reté, incluso estuve muy lejos hasta escuchar el tren llegar. No la miré, no hice nada aparte de huir, pero cuando subí a mi transporte le dediqué una mirada desde el cristal... iba a volver y seria yo quien la hiciese pedazos. . . . En unos minutos llegué al lugar, el clima era mas frió de lo usual, tal vez porque alguien había muerto o quizás el aire acondicionado. \"Kim JunMyeon, descanse en paz. Por favor solo familiares y amigos.\" 'No lo conozco señor, pero entrare de todas formas, porque no tengo la puta culpa de que usted se muera antes de saber de mi existencia' - pensé. Han visto alguna vez su propia expresión cuando un tranvía les pasa por el rostro? ... No? .. Pues esa es mi cara en este momento. Cuando les digo que el mundo es una mierda rara, créanme. Si no fuese porque había un ataúd en la parte de en frente, seguiría pensando de que eso era alguna convención hipie o algo así, Todos vestían coloridamente y yo solo pude llegar a la conclusion de que ese tal junmyeon fue un puto drogadicto mientras vivió... Ocupé un asiento en la ultima fila, sin llamar mucho la atención al hacerlo. Una persona narraba un largo discurso con lo típico \"Eras el mejor, te llevaremos por siempre en nuestras memorias\" ... me aburrí, así que me dispuse a observar a las personas, cabezas y espaldas ordinarias, 2 o 3 lloraban el resto solo fingía... No lo sé, ni siquiera puedo entenderlo, no recuerdo desde cuando todo funciona así. La gente sana rápidamente, se inyectan anestesia , mientras yo sigo intranquilo, no me encuentro en paz. Soy solo un niño, la muerte es difícil, la muerte es simple, explico lo que no entiendo y de nuevo, como cada día ... Tengo miedo. Me encantaría saber de que.. Estuve tan concentrado en mi nada, que ni siquiera me di cuenta que tenia los ojos fijos en la nuca blanca de un chico, casi instantáneamente a mi hallazgo, él se voltea, me mira, me sonríe... Así, como si tuviera el derecho. Aquí es otra vez donde mi rostro es habitado por un tranvía. No devolví el gesto. Mi cuerpo solo se tensó. Tal vez sus dientes blancos fueron dagas silenciosas. . . . La reunión terminó cuando le dio la gana... lo siento. Me acerqué al ataúd, nadie pareció ponerme especial atención así que pude observar con detenimiento la fotografía del fallecido.. kim junmyeon y sus pómulos abultados me causaron un poco de tristeza, era muy joven y parecía feliz... Por qué murió? . . Estuve observando el lugar por unos minutos mas y luego fui hacia la mesa llena de deliciosos bocadillos, me decidí por unas galletas de miel, son fuertes y crocantes , perfectas para construir con ellas. - \"Me gusta tu casa\" la voz repentina hizo que me asustara y golpeara con mi propio brazo la obra de arte, todas las galletas caían al suelo y se quebraban. Furioso por ello, me di la vuelta para saber quien era el culpable de semejante desastre.. y entonces... El chico de las dagas -'es un castillo, bueno.. lo era. - Mi voz salio casi como un susurro y luego corrí hacia la puerta de salida. El chico me persiguió.. y pensé... \"va a asesinarme\" -\"No usamos la ropa negra debido a que suho pidió hacerlo de esta forma y..\" -No tengo esa clase de ropa - le interrumpí. El chico hizo un puchero y se puso una de sus manos en la cabeza .. Me obstaculizaba el paso, así que lo empuje y salí corriendo como un loco por las calles - le escuché decir algo como 'cual es tu nombre?' pero lo ignore. seguí corriendo y no pare hasta llegar a casa .. realmente créanme cuando les digo que el mundo es una mierda rara. . . . Casi oscurecía cuando por fin entre a mi casa, kyungsoo esperándome, lo mire bien y concluí que estaba enojado. -¿Donde estuviste hoy? - me dijo. \"Servicio de defunción\" - no puedo mentirle. Kyungsoo me miró con reproche pero después sonrió, señalándome el juego de batalla naval sobre la mesa. \"Jugamos?\" - me pidió con los ojos y yo solo asentí. . . \"¿C9? -pregunté. \"fallaste\" me golpeé ligeramente la cabeza por la frustración. \"E4? - preguntó con una mirada victoriosa. \"Odio este juego, como es que siempre ganas ?\" kyungsoo rió a carcajadas. 'soy el mejor en ello después de todo' Lo acompañe en su risa. Disfruto mucho de jugar con kyungsoo, le encanta este juego, por ello no recuerdo ni una sola vez en que yo lo haya derrotado. Finjo estar molesto por perder, pero en realidad me agrada que sea de esta forma. Kyungsoo es mi único amigo, lo conocí cuando todo acabo, bueno, al menos para mí... me gusta que este sonriendo como lo hace ahora, por esoaveces hago cosas sin sentido, como jugar batalla naval con un kamikaze.. \"Encontraste algo hoy ?\" \"Sigo sintiéndome igual '- le respondí'. 'solo deberías dejar de ir a funerales de gente que no conoces, chanyeol' Me gustaría prometerla algo como eso a mi amigo pero.. esa es mi necesidad amorfa. \"Voy a tomarme un tiempo, hoy conocí un chico bastante extraño y si no va a asesinarme de seguro que llamará a la policía\" - miré a kyungsoo con un temor exagerado. 'mmm, asi que un chico - kyungsoo hizo una pausa para ya saben... *inserte emoji pervert 'Como es él? ' Le devolví la mirada mas in significativa posible. -Yo que se.. es molesto y colorido y ademas guarda dagas en su boca. kyungsoo rió a carcajadas y yo le seguí. . . -Chanyeol, ven a comer.. la cena esta lista. Sí, la escuché pero solo ignore. EXTRA (tia de chanyeol) *Narrado por dara. \"como van las cosas con tu sobrino?\" - me preguntó kris. Solo pude echarme a llorar escandalosamente. 'kris, él ni siquiera me habla es como si ignorara mi existencia. No se que hacer, se la pasa encerrado en su habitación jugando ese estúpido juego de barcos, riéndose a carcajadas, al principio pensé que traía a sus amigos; pero nada de eso. No hay nadie allí, nadie entra ni sale de esta casa ademas de el y yo. chanyeol esta solo..

El infinito conflicto del bien y el mal. Luz y sombras, meras palabras con un significado dado por algún ser, tomado por los humanos como algo contundente. Luz es igual a bondad, amor, altruismo, felicidad. Las sombras son odio, rencor, sufrimiento, asesinatos. Los humanos suelen ser bondadosos mas que otra cosa, pero lo hacen por supervivencia, en su ser esta el vivir de la mejor manera posible, y es ese echo el que lleva a cuestionar si en realidad… el bien es lo correcto. ¿Por qué el mal no es lo correcto?, si después de todo no sabemos que vino primero, ni siquiera comprendemos un poco de donde venimos nosotros y por que razón o razones existimos en un mundo tan maravilloso, que decae poco a poco con nuestras aparentes buenas acciones. ¿Podríamos vivir sin nuestras comodidades? Quizás innecesarias hasta cierto punto. ¿No somos egoístas y crueles al quitarle a un cuerpo celeste tan hermoso su belleza, su vida? … ¿no nos convierte eso en seres malignos? ¿Somos realmente buenos? ¿Quién debe respetar a quien? El mundo no es nuestro, los animales no son nuestros, se supone que llegamos después y no lo respetamos como deberíamos. Al final, no importa si es grande o pequeña, de mucha o poca importancia, según lo estimen, la batalla del bien y el mal nunca terminara, al menos eso parece… \" Por que yo no deseo gobernar el planeta, solo quiero eliminar a los humanos de un mundo al que desprecian\". -El sonido de la campana indicaba que el día de actividades escolares al fin había concluido. Los alumnos de la preparatoria Faygetzu tomaban sus cosas y salían del recinto con un orden digno del ejercito, ciertamente parecían mas soldados que estudiantes, pero por mas ridículo que eso pareciera era una exigencia del colegio, mas bien una tonta costumbre ante la vista de todos los estudiantes, sin embargo era el colegio mas reconocido sobre la fas de la tierra, así que tenían que aguantárselo, y los padres de cada joven pagaban demasiado por que cada uno de ellos permaneciera en esa gran institución, por lo que cada joven obedecía las normas extravagantes que el colegio tenia. Un grupo de jóvenes se encontraba conversando animadamente en un establecimiento de bebidas frías, helados y variedad de pastelillos, vestían con un pantalón azul muy fuerte, una camisa de cuello blanca con azul cielo y zapatos negros muy bien lustrados; se podía identificar rápidamente que eran del instituto Faygetzu. Uno de ellos un joven de diecisiete años: Delgado, de un metro con setenta y tres centímetros, de tez morena y no muy corpulento, cabello castaño, ojos marrones. La otra era una chica de dieciséis: Esbelta, un metro con cincuenta, cabello largo negro, ojos azules, tez blanca, no muy pronunciada en sus atributos. El ultimo de ellos de dieciséis años igual: No tan blanco como la chica, un metro ochenta, cabello negro, ojos marrones fuerte y delgado. No era algo distinto de lo que solían hacer después de una aburrida jornada estudiantil; pasar tiempo en ese puesto tomando sus deliciosas bebidas frías con pastelillos de vainilla, chocolate, etc… era un día más en sus rutinarias vidas. Al terminar los tres se dirigieron cada cual a su hogar, lo siguiente que solían hacer, jugar videojuegos en línea, gracias a la modernidad, la tecnología mas bien, podían adentrarse en su juegos preferidos y vivir de primera mano la emoción de ser un gran guerrero, un poderoso mago o la criatura que ellos eligiesen dependiendo del juego, y subir de nivel, matando criaturas poderosas, o realizando tareas para los NPC o tradeando cosas con otros jugadores. Tenían una gran imaginación, y su deseo mas grande era poder tener esos grandioso poderes y salvar la tierra, ya saben cosas burdas que no tienen cabida en la vida real, que solo se da en juegos e historietas, en películas hollywoodenses y demás idioteces. Pero quien podía culparlos, en algún momento la mayoría desea eso, acabar con el mal del planeta, aunque sea solo encerrando a los criminales, la plaga de la sociedad, los que por alguna razón se desvían del camino, por así decirlo. ¿?: Oye Natsuki, pude conseguir la vasija del ogro –le comentaba mediante una video llamada dentro del juego-. Natsuki: -Muy emocionada por la noticia- ¡Genial Kiry!, ahora solo debes entregarla en el templo de lusimer y pasaras de nivel. ¿Cómo te va a ti Gerardo? Gerardo: -Mirando la pantalla- No muy bien, mi equipo aun no se pone de acuerdo a donde iremos, así no subiré nivel esta noche, que frustrante. -La noche proseguía, las personas continuaban con sus vidas, cosa que a estos jóvenes les importaba un comino, o una mierda si les gusta más esa palabra. Los cielos comenzaron a nublarse, nubes negras, tal vez por la noche, pero si bien cargadas de agua y poder eléctrico; amenazaban con dejar caer su furia sobre la ciudad, y no paso mucho para que comenzara a llover, de igual manera los rayos hicieron acto de presencia, asustando a varios incautos… y para la mala suerte de otros, estos los calcinaron. Mientras la lluvia hacia de las suyas en el exterior, los chicos jugaban en su mundo lleno de magia. Pero a la vida le gusta la chingadera ¿o a los humanos les gusta eso?, dentro del juego les apareció a los tres y a los miles de usuarios conectados un mensaje de alerta por tormenta eléctrica, por supuesto solo a los de esa ciudad. Rápidamente vino el descenso de conectados, haciendo caso omiso los tres jóvenes ya mencionados antes. Algunos usuarios les pedían que se desconectaran por seguridad, pues ya había habido casos donde personas perdían la vida cuando llegaban las tormentas eléctricas, pues lo rayos si impactaban de alguna forma en las cercanías del hogar o de donde se encontrara el casco virtual, este se quemaba y terminaba fundiéndoles el cerebro… pero a ellos ¿Qué les podía pasar?, así que continuaron a pesar de las insistencias de sus amigos y Jugadores Maestros del juego. Pero si algo tiene que pasar, simplemente sucede… tres rayos impactaron en las cercanías de los muchachos, mas su suerte fue mayor, fueron desconectados del juego abruptamente, sus cabezas les dolían pero pudieron quitarse los cascos, se sentían aturdidos, dejaron los cascos en un escritorio y al mismo tiempo decidieron llamarse por sus celulares-. Kiry: Natsuki, Gerardo, ¿se encuentran bien? Gerardo: Si, si no, no te habríamos contestado. Natsuki: No seas grosero Gerardo, pero como sea, si estamos bien. Kiry: Creo que debimos salirnos antes, neta que me asuste cuando me desconecte de golpe. Natsuki: Yo también… lo malo que no estas aquí para poderte abrazar, aun me asustan poquito los rayos –su voz ya era en tono chipilona-. Gerardo: Ay, ya van a empezar, saben que, hasta mañana hermana, cuñadito –colgó su celular y se tiro en su cama para dormirse-. Natsuki: Jajaja, sabia que se iría si decía algo como eso. Yo también me iré a dormir Kiry, te quiero, buenas noches –corto la llamada y se acostó a dormir-. -Mientras tanto Kiry en su habitación daba vueltas sobre su cama, no por que estuviese muy enamorado, bueno en parte, pero su cabeza volvía a sentir un fuerte dolor, como pulsaciones. Al cabo de media hora estas pararon y pudo conciliar el sueño. Del espacio, una pequeña nave viajaba a gran velocidad con dirección hacia la tierra. Los astrónomos, quienes son los primeros en identificar ese tipo de cosas, informaron rápidamente a la NASA, la cual rápidamente lo hizo altamente confidencial; tal vez era la llegada de una nave extraterrestre que se había descompuesto o desviado de su trayectoria, sea cual fuese el caso, ellos tenían la obligación de anticipar el lugar de impacto e ir en la brevedad posible por los restos de la nave. La nave se estrello en alguna parte de un bosque en Europa. Claro que la NASA no era la única interesada en esa nave, y para suerte de los europeos y rusos, esta había caído muy cerca de ellos. No muchas tropas fueron mandadas al lugar, Estados Unidos de América había enviado sus jets y varios soldados. Las fuerzas de tres naciones se encontraron frente a una pequeña nave, por lo que pudieron apreciar esta era para un solo pasajero, a menos que fuesen del tamaño de insectos, pero esa era una ocurrencia tonta de humanos. Comenzaron a husmear los alrededores en busca de algún tipo de vida extraño que haya podido llegar en esa cosa, no encontrando algo, se debatían ahora quien se quedaría con la nave, idioteces diplomáticas o algo por el estilo-. ¿?: A pesar de habitar el mismo mundo, de mirar los mismos cielos, discuten por algo tan insignificante como mi maltrecha nave. -Todos los soldados voltearon al escuchar la tétrica voz que sonaba sobre ellos, la imagen los congelo, era como ver al diablo de sus anécdota bíblicas, de sus imágenes antiguas. Una figura espeluznante, demoniaca, con un gran cuerpo rojizo, llameante, brazos musculosos, afiladas garras, cola larga con punta de flecha, una cabeza con ojos negros y cuernos sobre ella; que se mantenía con un par de alas carmesí sobre todos ellos. Los soldados consientes de sus puestos reaccionaron y tomaron sus ametralladoras, vaciando por completo sus cargadores, esperando haber herido a la criatura y en el mejor de los casos haberla matado-. ¿?: Por favor –se burlaba la criatura-, ¿acaso creen que soy nuevo en el universo como ustedes?, que no en su mundo hacen películas donde muestran claramente que las balas no dañas a los seres alienígenas, bueno al menos no a todos, pero estoy divagando mucho ¿no creen? -Los soldados, ahora llenos de terror, sintiéndose indefensos, corrieron cual marica lo haría al verse en una situación de peligro que es obvio no podría manejar, subieron a sus jeeps, los otros corrieron sin rumbo por el bosque… aunque en su mente algunos pensaban que igual era en vano, por alguna razón ese comentario de películas, el cual todos entendieron por alguna razón, les hacia saber que pasaría a continuación-. ¿?: Van a morir. -Una masacre sin precedentes se llevo acabo en esos bosques, únicos testigos de la muerte de los soldados de la distintas naciones-. ¿?: Mundo, he venido a salvarte tal cual lo has pedido por tanto tiempo. Perdona mi manera de hacer las cosas, pero yo… soy un asesino. -El demonio expandió sus majestuosas alas y emprendió vuelo hacia lo más alto de los cielos, él debía observar un poco la situación, o simplemente quería ver como arrasaría con los humanos, solo éste lo sabe. Kiry despertó mucho mejor para el día siguiente, el dolor de cabeza había desaparecido; y algo había cambiado en él, su cuerpo estaba mas fornido, así a cualquiera le darían ganas de hacer ejercicio… pues sin importar la razón, ahora era fuerte y de seguro a su novia le encantaría, como un extra para ella. Dejando ese pensamiento típico de adolescente, casi adulto; preparo su desayuno y alisto su mochila, había que ir a clases, y sus padres le habían dejado una nota diciéndole lo mucho que lo querían, cosa muy apreciada por el, es bueno tener una linda familia. Por su parte Natsuki seguía admirándose en el espejo, aun no le cabía en la cabeza la imagen de lo que sus propios ojos veían atreves del espejo. Su cuerpo se había desarrollado, crecido, se puso buenísima en pocas palabras, al carajo las formalidades y palabras lindas. Ahora estaba batallando por que sus sujetadores le quedaban chicos; pero su madre le ayudo en eso. Gerardo no tuvo ningún cambio aparente, solo se sentía mas audaz, con mucha energía, un tanto ansioso, tenía que liberarla un poco. Los tres ingresaron al colegio, por supuesto Natsuki y Kiry se sorprendieron mutuamente con sus cambios, tanto que andaban un poco de resbalosos por ahí, cosa que molestaba de sobremanera a Gerardo y unos cuantos mas estudiantes que no tenían pareja, celosos. Las clases siguieron sus cursos. Mientras en el mundo de las noticias, cosas mas importantes para los adultos, veían aterrados imágenes sangrientas de los cuerpos de soldados de las distintas naciones, claro que el gobierno había alterado la nota diciendo que se trato de un problema político y terminaron enfrascándose en una batalla… cosa que pocos creyeron, es bien sabido que el gobierno es idiota y nos quiere meter pendejadas en la mente… y otra cosa por detrás, pero ese es otro tema. La noticia se divulgo rápido por los canales amarillistas, o amarillistas entre comillas, no soy un experto… y comenzaron las miles de especulaciones, todas equivocas-. -Mientras el demonio, terminaba de analizar la situación. El gobierno seguía metido de fondo en este asunto; ¿Cómo frenar algo aparentemente invencible? El ser espacial desplego sus alas y partió vuelo hacia una metrópolis. Las personas hacían sus cosas cotidianas, ya se lo imaginaran: gritarle al conductor de enfrente por idiota por no ver que la señal ya cambio, caminar por ahí, comprar ropa, comida o cualquier otra cosa. Para la sorpresa absoluta de todos, un automóvil exploto, luego un edificio y consecuentemente las personas entraron en pánico. A pesar de aun no ver a su agresor, ya corrían sin sentido u orden, llegando a lastimarse unas a otras. El ejército llego a la escena y fue ahí cuando el demonio hizo su aparición, rápidamente fue bombardeado y rafageado con todo lo que el poder militar humano tenia a su alcance, y con lo que podían, pues no era parte de su objetivo destruir la ciudad. Ceso el fuego, los pobladores veían impaciente el humo esperando ver el cadáver de esa maldita cosa; tal decepción se llevaron al ver al demonio como si nada volando sobre el mismo sitio donde había aparecido. El terror invadió a toda la metrópoli incluido el poder militar, aquellos mas capacitados para hacerle frente a cualquier cosa; pero todos los humanos podemos sentir miedo sin excepción. Kiry y los demás chicos del instituto fueron evacuados, más bien expulsados del recinto, los padres de la mayoría llegaron rápidamente preocupados. Por su parte Kiry, Natsuki y Gerardo solamente salieron y fueron a su sitio favorito de siempre. Al llegar vieron a mas gente de lo normal, unos amontonados sobre los cristales intentando ver lo que mostraba el televisor dentro del local. Los muchachos entraron y quedaron boca abierta, una de las mayores metrópolis había sido completamente destruida, no había cadáveres, ni edificios, coches, carteles, absolutamente todo en ese lugar había desaparecido, solo quedaba tierra. Kiry:- Jalo a sus amigos fuera del local- Oigan, si esa cosa del espacio o lo que sea que dicen, es tan poderosa, supongo que nosotros podremos detenerla. Natsuki: ¿Por qué dices eso? ¡Estas loco! Kiry: No te has dado cuenta… nuestros cambios físicos, no son por pura casualidad. Estuve hablando con varios jugadores a los que les paso lo mismo. Gerardo: ¿A dónde quieres llegar? Kiry: Ellos desarrollaron u obtuvieron poderes; cosa que nosotros también deberíamos tener. Según me contaban esos poderes son de acuerdo al personaje que usabas en ese momento, y como no todos jugaban el mismo juego, hay muchas personas con distintos poderes. Los míos serian los de caballero, los de Natsuki de asesina de sombras y los tuyos de mago elemental. Justo cuando Natsuki y Gerardo iban a abrir sus bocas, tres camionetas negras les rodearon, de estas bajaron hombres y mujeres uniformados de negro con armas en mano. Uniformado: No opongan resistencia, sabemos quienes y que son, vengan con nosotros, por favor. Natsuki: Y ¿Quiénes se supone que son? Uniformado: Esa información no pude ser discutida en un lugar como este, no tenemos mucho tiempo, deprisa deben venir con nostros. Las palabras del uniformado les parecieron sinceras y los tres estuvieron de acuerdo en ir con ellos. Los llevaron por algun camino desconocido y luego solo vieron una fuerte luz blanca que los cegó por un instante; al recuperar la visión visualizaron a cientos de personas ahí paradas como perdidas, unas preguntaban a los uniformados pero estos parecían no querer decirles nada. Bajaron del coche y seguido de estos otros dos automóviles mas llegaron, descendiendo de ellos otro grupo de jóvenes y dos adultos hombres. ¿?: ¡Mi nombre es Fausto! –Interrumpió el bullicio de todos con voz gruesa-, yo responderé sus dudas. Están aquí por que sabemos de sus poderes adquiridos por nuestros cascos de realidad virtual, no es que quisiéramos que los obtuvieran, simplemente a la naturaleza o a alguna deidad se le dio la gana de hacerlo, y en buena hora, puesto que como la mayoría ya sabrá, un demonio espacial esta exterminando a la raza humana y en lo que se ve en su totalidad, no deja ni estructuras en pie. Sabiendo esto, pueden concluir el hecho de que estamos todos aquí para proteger nuestro planeta. No somos del ejército ni estamos vinculados con el gobierno, solo somos una asociación que desarrolla hardware y software para videojuegos, claro, con un pequeño secreto… estábamos preparados para algún evento de esta magnitud, aunque no esperábamos que ustedes se hicieran súper humanos. Después de terminar su discursito, que por cierto, daba en cierta forma a entender que estaba algo chiflado el amigo, ¿Quién en su sano juicio espera estar preparado para un evento similar? No es que los aliens nos quieran estar invadiendo por mero placer ¿o si?; como sea el caso, luego de eso todos fueron equipados con trajes de batalla de punta, no lo se, el mejor material que pueda existir, como me complican la cosa. Lo mas extraño es que ninguno se negó a ir a la lucha, sabiendo que probablemente morirán-. -El gobierno no sabia como reaccionar, mas ciudades habían desaparecido en menos de tres días, Estados Unidos seria borrado de los mapas en dos semanas si esto no se detenía. Y lo peor es que estaban perdiendo el control sobre la ciudadanía. Cuando hay un evento de destrucción de gran magnitud, donde el terror, el miedo y esas emociones de inseguridad dominaba a las personas, cosas terribles suceden, violencia, violaciones, robos, asaltos, saqueos; a la mierda la sociedad, si todos están siendo masacrados… por que no pensar mejor en mi mismo y que se vayan al carajo los demás. Desgraciadamente es así como se maneja la humanidad, no digo que todos, pero esos pendejos que si, arruinan a los demás y probablemente los arrastren a imitarlos al verse tan vulnerables y tan vacios, de cosas materiales, de comida, agua, un hogar incluso. Los del alto mando, solo podían observar, e incluso darse el lujo de mejor hacerse de la vista gorda, ellos son importantes, tienen la vida mas asegurada que cualquier individuo promedio, los ricos también se esconderían como maricones, con alguien que les pudiese limpiar la cola; aunque decirlo así es como demostrar mi envidia, la envidia de los desafortunados que solo son uno mas en el planeta, cuanta desgracia-. -El demonio llego a Nueva York, todo, absolutamente todo el ejército estadounidense estaba concentrado en ese punto, lo habían esperado por días y los gringos estaban dispuestos a todo para exterminarlo. Demonio: ¿Es en serio?, todos esperándome, me facilitan mucho las cosas…y veo que traen sus armas inútiles, se ven que se aferran mucho a la esperanza. ¡Que quede bien claro humanos! ¡Todos van a ser exterminados no importa si tratan de esconderse!, he asesinado a su presidente fuerzas Americanas, y demás gobernantes. Son tan cobardes y se traicionan a ustedes mismos, mandan a otros a luchar sus batallas y si es necesario los abandonan a su suerte, mintiéndoles con lindas frases. Los soldados, la humanidad, todo el mundo escucho el mensaje, por medio de la cámara que tenían uno de los soldados, si aun en una situación así, había un reportero entre ellos, informando al mundo donde fue traducida en el idioma correspondiente, el demonio había hablado en gringo, para que sepan. Sin mas que escuchar o pensar, todas las unidades abrieron fuego, pero esta vez con su artillería mas potente, el Demonio esta vez esquivo los disparos, se movía con majestuosidad en el aire, sus alas eran hermosas con las explosiones de fondo, le daban un toque perfecto. Las bombas no se hicieron esperar, los jets comenzaron a rodearlo y a descargar su furia en él. Pero era la hora del contraataque, de sus alas salieron despedidas dos cuchillas de energías, que al impactar destruyeron un tercio de Nueva York. A pesar del miedo que les causo, el supremo comandante de todos ordeno seguir con el fuego, no quería llegar a la bomba nuclear, pero las bombas atómicas ya estaban el la lista de siguiente recurso para intentar matarlo. Y al ver como los jets caían completamente, como de sus garras salían fuego que calcinaba a sus soldados, rayos de sus cuernos que destruían las edificaciones, ordeno el uso de bombas atómicas. Éxito al impactar, fracaso al derribar, el Demonio había resistido la explosión, pero todos los soldados habían muerto por ello, habían fallado en su misión, murieron sin honor ni gloria y probablemente nadie pudiese recordarlos alguna vez. Ahora solo le restaba destruir las edificaciones restantes; él estaba molesto, puesto que por aferrados, los humanos habían matado a varias criaturas con sus bombas, eso lo entristecía y enfurecía a la vez, alzo sus alas y se dirigió a México-. -Kiry se encontraba un poco cansado, pero mas que nada celoso, un tipo había estado coqueteando con su novia mientras a él lo tenían en entrenamiento. Natsuki: Kiry, ya deja de estar enojado, te digo que nada que ver ese tipo. Kiry: Pero bien que te dejabas que te tocara ¿no?, no estoy ciego, veía claramente como te ponía las manos en los brazos. Incluso llego a tocar tu pelo. Natsuki: Ay, y no mas por eso… Kiry: ¡Si, nomas por eso! ¡A ti no te gustaría ver que otra chica me acariciara o me manoseara! ¿Verdad? Natsuki: Bueno –bajo la cabeza como con arrepentimiento-, la verdad es que no, solo yo tengo derecho a eso. Kiry: Pues lo mismo va para mi, ese imbécil, no tiene derecho a eso, a hablarte si, pero no a tocarte. Natsuki: Eres muy celoso –se acerco a su mejilla y le planto un beso, luego se fue a entrenar puesto que ya le llamaban-. Kiry ahora ya mas controlado, decidió dar una vuelta por las instalaciones. Un lugar de paredes azules claro, con focos fluorescentes, puertas corredizas, con mucha habitaciones, una gran sala comedor, baños, y otras cosas irrelevantes para sepa que uso. Kiry dio con una habitación de información, en ella había sujetos con bata blanca, les pregunto que veían en sus monitores de sus computadoras; estos les respondieron que estaban al tanto de lo que el demonio hacia gracias a sus satélites ¿Y solo decían ser una compañía para ayudar a mejorar los videojuegos?, se entero de que Nueva York ya no existía mas y que México estaba en aprietos en esos momentos. Tomo a uno de los sujetos con furia de su bata y le comenzó a gritar que si por que no hacían algo para detenerlo, con tantas personas con súper poderes, algo debían hacer, no nomas estar mirando. Fausto: ¡Sujeto 98, suelte a ese hombre! –su voz autoritaria intimido a Kiry quien rápidamente obedeció-. No los hemos enviado contra el Demonio por que están puliendo sus habilidades, cálmate, que no vez que es capaz de borrar ciudades enteras, cuando acaben todos con su entrenamiento estarán listos, no tendrán una verdadera experiencia en guerra, pero por lo menos no irán como simples peones a morir, podrán defenderse y vencerlo ¡Juntos! Kiry respiro profundo y salió de esa habitación, quería ver como entrenaba su novia, eso lo pondría más feliz-. -El Demonio había acabado con todo el continente americano, había destruido petroleras en el mar, y cualquier cosa construida por humanos, todo era como en un principio, tierra, agua, vegetación y animales; el balance que debió permanecer desde un principio… los humanos somos como la plaga que llego sabrá de donde solo para joder al planeta al que nosotros mismos llamamos tierra. Al llegar al viejo continente, lo que encontró lo dejo extrañado, las personas de Irak estaban rezando, arrodilladas con la cabeza en el suelo. El Demonio aterrizo frente a ellas, se les acerco un poco lentamente luego se quedo quieto; las personas levantaron lentamente la cabeza para poder verlo, nadie decía algo, todos expectantes, muertos de miedo. Un niño se acerco al Demonio, mientras su madre le gritaba. Madre: Abdul, no vayas ¡regresa ahora mismo! –con el llanto en su rostro, pero inmovilizada, solo veía a su hijo coger el brazo de aquel ser maligno-. Niño: Señor demonio, no nos mate, nosotros no le hemos hecho nada a usted. El niño quería estallar en lagrimas, sus ojos suplicantes se clavaron en los ojos del ser carmesí, este alzo sus garras derechas y las coloco sobre la cabeza del infante. Todos veían la escena ¿acaso el niño había tocado el corazón de la criatura?, por favor, cuan incrédula puede ser la gente, deberían saber que el mal es el mal y no mas, por que nos gusta tanto creer en esas babosadas que vemos en las películas o series animadas, donde el malo por un milagro, por mariconadas humanas se vuelve bueno, no, así no son las cosas, y él se los haría saber de una puta buena vez. La cabeza del infante quedo echa mierda en un instante, la madre murió de un infarto al ver esa escena, las personas gritaron, lloraron, y suplicaron a su dios que los salvara, pero nada de eso paso, solo murieron, todos. Y la humanidad llego a su estado más crítico-. -Mientras unas personas se seguían matando entre si, por posesiones que realmente no valían en esos momentos, el ejercito del viejo continente se unía en uno solo, el mayor poder militar junto en la historia de la humanidad, miles y miles de personas con y sin experiencia, unidos a súper humanos creados por algún extraño suceso del destino, si así lo queremos ver. Fausto discutía enérgicamente con varios comandantes de alto rango. Fausto: ¡Señor!, entienda de una buena puta vez que no soy un nerd cualquiera, por mis inventos ahora tenemos un gran número de personas con poderes extraordinarios. Les dije que no sabia por que habían adquiridos esos poderes, pero la verdad es que yo lo tenia ya planeado, son mis marionetas pero ellos no lo saben. Ahora yo soy la persona mas poderosa del planeta, y mas le vale que me haga caso –dos hombres de edad media aparecieron tras Fausto y con sus poderes psíquicos alzaron al comandante, dejando a los demás con la boca cerrada-. Espero que con esa pequeña demostración me crea, ahora; ese ser del espacio si que es un problema, no me dejara conquistar y gobernar el mundo si no deja humanos vivos, por lo que acabaremos con el juntos y después me proclamare rey de la tierra. Comandante: Solo puedo decirle, que esta usted loco, pero por lo visto no tenemos otra opción. Fausto sabía por que lo llamaban loco. Las personas que tiene poder y lo pierden se sienten degradadas, y cuando una persona quiere gobernar todo el mundo, por lógica se vuelve loca, o al menos eso he aprendido, después de todo, todos somos egoístas y aunque sea para un bien mayor, nadie puede, ni nos gustaría que nos gobernasen, todos quieren ser libres aun cuando se equivoquen. Aunque dejando eso de lado, lo que realmente pensaba el comandante, es que no iba a dejar que un nerd mierdero que no sabe de guerras ni algo por el estilo, a su parecer, lo humillara. Puesto que los preparativos se estaban finalizando, Kiry y Natsuki no querían desaprovechar su tal vez ultimo encuentro, se escabulleron por el recinto y se encerraron en alguna habitación de por ahí, tenían que disfrutar las pocas horas que tenían, y que mejor para dos jóvenes casi adultos, que teniendo sexo. No puedo entrar en detalles, pero digamos que les fue muy bien, regresaron con los demás y cada quien se fue a su puesto. El Demonio había estado un tanto tranquiló, a pesar de que seguía destruyendo las ciudades, algo se le hacia raro, la falta de población en ella, ¿Dónde estaban escondiéndose los humanos ahora? Llego a parís y su respuesta le fue dada, todos estaban ahí, una vez mas esperándolo. Demonio: Debe ser todos los que quedan, ya casi planeta. -La batalla por la humanidad comenzaba, lo primero en ser lanzado fueron las bombas nucleares, las cuales impactaron de lleno en el demonio, gracias a la habilidad de algunos sujetos la radiación fue rápidamente eliminada dándoles fuerza física adicional para la batalla; el Demonio carmesí extendió sus alas y comenzó a agitarlas, fuertes ráfagas volcaron varios de los tanques y lanzaron a miles de soldados y súper humanos por los aires, al tiempo que eran rebanados por el viento. Los humanos contraatacaron con diversos poderes y con su poder de fuego, pero su enemigo respondía y esquivaba eficazmente, anulando las energías. La humanidad estaba en deceso, todo el poder militar había sido destruido, ahora solo había súper humanos sobre la faz de la tierra. Natsuki: Kiry –dijo abrazándolo fuertemente, mientras su voz se quebraba-, tengo miedo… y no lo soporto –finalmente comenzó a llorar-. Ver… tan…ta gente muerta; una cosa era verles en los animes y películas, pero esto… es… demasiado, no lo soporto, no quiero verte muerto ¡No quiero morir! Kiry no sabia como responder, sabia que podía darle la respuesta que ella quería escuchar, pero y si al final fallaba y no podía cumplirlo…y fue en ese momento en que Fausto hizo su aparición. Fausto: Mis súper humanos –todos voltearon a verle-, son magníficos, y se que podrían vencer al demonio, pero ese honor me corresponde a mi. Con alguna especie de control, del cual oprimió un botón, los súper humanos comenzaron a sentir un terrible dolor, y sus poderes comenzaron a ser drenados para pasárselos a Fausto, él recibía los poderes de todos, excepto de Kiry y Natsuki quienes se resistían con toda su fuerza de voluntad, obvio son los protagonistas, como mierda los voy a matar. Kiry: Natsuki, solo resiste un poco… El drenado termino, y aunque Fausto vio que no pudo quitarle los poderes a esos dos, la verdad no le importo, ya era lo suficientemente fuerte. Demonio: Cuanto descaro. Fausto: Callate demonio, tu exterminaste a la humanidad, yo solo te hare pagar por ello. Demonio: La raza humana no merecía vivir en este planeta más tiempo. Kiry: ¡Y quien te da el derecho de decidir eso! Demonio: El planeta mismo, los odia y quería que fueren eliminados, el lo intento por mucho tiempo, pero no pudo, mas bien, no tiene las fuerzas necesarias, pensó que cambiarían, pero siguieron abusando de sus recursos y eso le salió caro, al final tuvo que llamarme. Natsuki: ¿Cómo podría el planeta odiarnos? Es incomprensible. Demonio: Ustedes solo son humanos ineptos que viven con caprichos estúpidos, nunca vieron las señales como debían haberlas visto, no escucharon los gritos desesperados de la tierra debido al daño que le provocaban, ahora solo quedan ustedes tres y van a morir, para que la tierra viva en paz, no la tierra no, el planeta. Kiry: Pues yo me niego a ser exterminado, solo quedamos tres, déjanos comenzar de nuevo, veras que las cosas serán diferentes. Fausto: Asi es, será un mundo mejor. Demonio: ¡Tú cállate, hipócrita de mierda! El demonio se abalanzo sobre Fausto, quien esquivo la embestida. Luego se enfrascaron en una batalla cuerpo a cuerpo, las garras del demonio chocaban contra el cuerpo de su rival, pero no podían dañarlo, tomo distancia y lanzo energía con sus alas, Fausto peco de confiando y perdió uno de sus brazos; irritado por el incidente acumulo energía en su otro brazo y lanzo un puñetazo directo en la cara del ser carmesí, pero este no surtió efecto, Fausto lanzo tanto poder pudo, pero la bestia alada los esquivo con facilidad. Demonio: ¿Crees que tus habilidades pueden detenerme? Soy un ser del espacio que habla con el planeta, se hasta donde llegan tus poderes, ella los conoce muy bien y me lo ha dicho, no me tomes por un estúpido. La garra del Demonio se oscureció, y en una fracción de segundo estaba enterrada en el pecho de Fausto, la desenterró y Fausto cayó de los cielos sin vida. El ser espacial bajo hasta donde estaban Kiry y Natsuki. Kiry: ¿Nos mataras? Demonio: Por supuesto. Natsuki entro en pánico total, dio un gran grito, una explosión se hizo presente pero ni Kiry ni el Demonio resultaron heridos, ella quiso atacar al demonio pero Kiry la detuvo, la atrajo hacia él y la abrazo con todas su fuerzas, mientras ella gritaba que la soltara. Kiry tenia miedo, pero sabia que si Fausto no pudo contra ese ser, mucho menos ellos lo harían, tampoco las palabras servirían. Kiry: Natsuki… te amo. Kiry asintió con la cabeza mientras miraba al Demonio, mientras sentía como Natsuki le abrazaba y le decía que ella también, y luego fueron borrados por algún poder. Y se cuestionaran por que no hizo hasta lo imposible para defender su planeta, es simple y a la vez puede que complicado. No puedes detener a alguien mas fuerte que tú, no importa cuanto lo intentes, por que de hacerlo entonces no seria mas fuerte que uno. Dos, entendió que los humanos eran el verdadero enemigo, pero disfrazados de los buenos que merecían vivir, una farsa. Tres no importaba si había algo después de sus muertes, el quería tenerla cerca, aunque después no significase nada. Demonio: Ahora planeta, puedes vivir en paz… se feliz. Dichas esas palabras el ser alado abandono el lugar. -Muchísimos años después, se ve a la tierra con una gran cantidad de árboles, vegetación y animales. Ellos se podrán matar entre si, pero lo hacen con moderación, bajo la balanceada regla que impone el planeta. Sin dudas ahora si es un lugar lleno de vida, a plenitud. Bajo la copa de un árbol se ve a un sujeto ponerse de pie. ¿?: Es bueno saber que así eres feliz, y te vez muy bien, bueno solo vine de paso, hasta nunca. La brisa soplo suavemente, como dándole las gracias por todo lo que hizo en el pasado, donde una plaga llegada de no se donde, había invadido sus tierras y mares, incluso su cielo y hasta habían tenido la osadía de su espacio externo en el espacio; pero que ahora ya no estaba ni estaría nunca en si.

Pertama, tuba falopi? adalah saluran yang dapat menhantarkan sel telur menuju rahim, itu juga tempat dimana sel telur dibuahi oleh sprema. tubektomi adalah pemotongan tubafalopi, perempuan memiliki dua buah tuba falopi. bed side monitor? kalian tau monitor samping tempat tidur yang biasa kalo di sinetron bunyi \"biiiip…biiipp…\" yang biasa di UGD atau ICU atau Ruang vvip. nah itu bed side monitor. pubis adalah area diatas organ reproduksi (genital) / dibawah pusar. terakhir anestesi itu bius, jadi spesialis anestesi itu spesialis membius. cukup yak typo(s), aneh dan flat happy reading :* bed side monitor Ruangan dengan cat berwarna putih, berbau obat dan bersuhu rendah tidak lain dan mudah kita tebak itu adalahrumah sakit. Gweboon baru saja membuka matanya, setelah ia menyadari ada pergerakan yang ia dengar meski pelan. ternyata suster Seulgi tengah mencatat kondisinya melalui monitor disampingnya. Cukup serius seulgi mencatat angka-angka yang tertera di monitor, sehingga ia tidak menyadari jika gweboon sudah siuman dari obat bius total yang ia terima. \"suster..\" gweboon berbicara lemah, mencoba menengok kearah seulgi dan seulgi segera membalas tatapan gweboon. \"apa operasi saya berjalan dengan baik? apa saya baik-baik saja?\" gweboon meraba pubisnya, terasa ada beberapa jahitan akibat luka operasi. Wajahnya meringis, menahan nyeri yang menguar begitu saja ketika ia sedikit bergerak. \"semuanya berjalan lancar nona\" jawab seulgi ramah, seulgi kembali menunggu, mungkin ada lagi hal yang ingin ditanyakan gweboon. \"apa aku harus memanggilnya nona?\" \"ti..tidak, tidak usah\" \"nona tidak perlu khawatir, tim dokter yunho yang menangani kasus nona, dan dari hasil catatan medis tidak ada efek samping yang terajdi akibat operasi ini\" Gweboon baru saja menjalani operasi pemotongan tuba falopi atau yang biasa dikenal dengan mau tidak mau harus melakukannya, karena pada saluran tuba falopi sebelah kanan gweboon terdapat tumor dan itu diharuskan untuk memotongnya. \"ya, tapi..\" gweboon bergumam lemah, tentu saja dibalik pemotongan saluran itu tentu ada akibatnya, kekecewaan pada dirinya sendiri amat sangat tergambarkan dari raut wajah gweboon. diusianya yang masih terbilang muda, 25 tahun dan ia belum memiliki anak, kini perhitungan memiliki seorang anak akan semakin kecil. \"nona, apa ada yang ingin ditanyakan lagi?\" seulgi bertanya sembari membereskan selimut gweboon \"ah dan sup, disamping .. nona harus segera memakannya\" \"suster, apa dia juga berada disana?\" \"tentu saja selain dokter spesialis bedah, spesialis anastesi juga dipelrukan bukan?\" Gweboon mengangguk paham. \"baiklah, saya permisi dulu ne\" Seulgi telah meninggalkan ruangan gweboon, sedangkan gweboon masih memikirkan kelanjutannya sebagai seorang wanita. ruangannya begitu sunyi, ia berdiam diri menghiraukan sup yang berisikan wortel dan bubur sebagai pelengkapnya. hanya suara monitor disampingnya lah yang meramaikan ruangannya, tubuhnya terlalu lemah, apa benar-benar tidak ada yang ingin menjenguknya? Lebih baik rasa nyeri ini ia tukar saja dengan rasa nyeri setelah melahirkan pikir gweboon.. luka jahitan ini tak seberapa lebar pikir gweboon, tapi mengapa begitu sensiti,p sedikit saja bergerak nyeri itu akan cepat terasa. \" apa aku tidak apa-apa, apa dia tidak khawatir…\" . . . Selang tiga puluh menit, pintu ruangan gweboon kembali terbuka. sesosok namja dengan stetoskop menggantung dibahunya berjalan pelan mendekati gweboon yang tidak melihat kearahnya. Namja dengan pakaian kemeja soft pink dibalut dengan jas putih ber- name tag Lee Jinki, meletakkan map biru yang ia bawa di nakas dekat tempat tidur gweboon. \"ehm, permisi\" jinki membuka pembicaraan, membuat gweboon dengan perlahan menengok kearah jinki. gweboon mengerjap lucu, lalu menunduk menyembunyikan wajahnya yang terlihat…sedikir merona. \"aku rasa sebentar lagi kau akan cepat pulang gwe\" \"benarkah?\" \"setelah aku melihat catatan medismu begitu\" jinki mengambil kursi dan map biru yang ia letakkan tadi. kini ia duduk tepat disamping tempat tidur gweboon. \"bisakah kau sebutkan ini dimana dan aku siapa?\" \"eii..apa dokter sedang memeriksa kesadaranku?\" jinki hanya tersenyum menanggapinya. \"ini di rumah sakit kyunghee dan kau dokter lee jinki\" \"apa catatan seulgi ini benar?\" gumam jinki yang masih dapat didengar gweboon, ia lalu menuliskan sesuatu pada map yang ia bawa. mungkin sejenis catatan perkembangan gweboon. \"aku rasa aku harus mengundurkan kepulanganmu\" \"wae?\" gweboon menatap jinki, suaranya melemah \"apa ada sesuatu yang salah, dengan operasi ini, atau… apa ada efek samping.. suster seulgi mengatakan aku baik-baik saja..kecuali..\" \"apa kau ingin duduk gwe?\" jinki menawarkan bantuannya sambil ia semakin mendekatkan kursinya agar ia bisa lebih jelas melihat wajah gweboon yang sedikit pucat. Jinki melihat aliran infus yang terpasang ditangan gwbeoon dan bergumam tak jelas, melihat lagi kearah jarum yang tertancap di telapak tangan atas gweboon dan bergumam kembali tak jelas. \"a..aniyo, ini masih terasa nyeri\" \"baiklah\" jinki menatap tepat kearah mata gweboon, begitu lebih baik dari hari sebelumnya, hari pertama gwbeoon masuk rumah sakit. \"apa ada yang mengganggu pikiranmu?\" gweboon mengalihkan pandangannya dari jinki \" aku hanya takut suamiku kecewa\" \"kecewa?\" gweboon mengangguk lemah \"aku takut akan susah memiliki keturunan\" air mata gweboon mengalir tanpa permisi, jemarinya saling mencengkaram menahan sesak didadanya. \"aku..aku semakin takut ketika kau disini, ketika…. kau bilang kepulanganku di undur\" suaranya kian melemah, pipinya kini telah basah, layaknya sungai air mata gweboon tak lagi tertahan. jinki beranjak dari tempat duduknya, tangannya tergerak mengusap air mata gweboon \"gweboon, kau masih memiliki satu tuba falopi dan kau masih bisa mengahasilkan sel telur sehingga kau masi bisa menghasilkan keturunan dan juga..\" \"juga apa jinki?\" gweboon menyela \"soal kepulanganmu, aku hanya merasa confuse apa kau mengidap penyakit jantung?\" jinki ternsenyum menyelidik. \"aku ..baik..saja\" \"lalu, mengapa ritme jantungmu sangat cepat eoh? padahal dalam catatan seulgi detak jantungmu normal\" jinki semakin memajukan tubuh nya kearah gweboon, menghadap wajah cantik nan ayu tanpa celah yang terpatri diwajah gweboon. \"aku baik-baik saja jinki..\" gweboon berucap lebih keras dari sebelumnya \"mung…mungkin ini karena efek khawatirku\" \"eii yang benar saja\" tangan jinki mengenggeam erat tangan gweboon tanpa menekan area infus. \"lihat.. kini detak jantungmu melebihi 100 kali permenit bukan? ini tidak normal gwe\" \"kau menggodaku dokter lee\" \"atau.. alat ini sebenarnya rusak, apa aku harus melepaskan alat ini\" jinki semakin mengerjai gweboon, raut gweboon tak lagi terlihat lemas, ia malah terlihat waspada \"kau harus melepas kancing atas mu, agar aku bisa melepaskan alat rusak ini, ini tertempel didadamu bukan?\" jinki menaik-turunkan alisnya, tersenyum jail kearah gweboon yang kini wajahnya semakin berwarna merah seperti buah kesukaannya. starwberry. gweboon tak memiliki penyakit jantung, gweboon tau ia baik-baik saja dan jinki pun tau jika istrinya baik-baik saja. yah gweboon adalah istri dari dokter lee jinki spesialis anastesi. sebut saja perubahan denyut jantung gweboon karena hormon cinta. gweboon selalu mengalaminya bahkan setelah menikah ketika berhadapan dengan lee jinki. dia tidak pernah berubah benak gweboon berkata. \"apa kau memakan sup yang bertaburan wortel itu?\" jinki menunjuk kearah mangkuk yang teronggok tak dihiraukan sedari tadi. \"aku jamin kau tidak akan menyukainya gwe, sebaiknya kau harus memesan pada seulgi untuk tidak memasukan wortel\" \"aku tidak bisa memesan layankya di restoran hanya karena aku istrimu\" mulut gweboon mengerucut lucu. jinki melepas genggaman tangannya dan mengusap lembut surai hitam milik gweboon sebelum ia mengambil mangkuk sup dan bubur dan kembali kearah gweboon. \"buka mulutmu gwe..\" \"aniyo jinki..\" \"kau harus makan\" gweboon kembali memalingkan wajahnya \"aku tidak lapar, aku hanya ingin pulang\" \"dan aku akan seharian dengan mu, bebas melukmu, menggendonmu hingga rasa nyeri itu hilang\" jinki kembali menggoda gweboon. \"aku tidak lapar\" gweboon semakin sering menggerakan badanya hingga membuatnya merasakan nyeri kembali. \"aakhh..\" \"aigo..\" jinki menaruh mangkuknya dan kembali mengusap sayang rambut gweboon. jinki merasa takjub dengan kecantikan dan keanggunan gweboon, bahkan dalam keadaan sakit saja gweboon masih terlihat cantik dengan wajah pucatnya, dengan bibirnya yang mungil walau tak secerah biasanya namun mampu menggoda untuk sekilah mengecupnya. \"eoh.. \"gweboon terkaget ketika bibirnya baru saja dihinggapi bibir jinki yang lembut. \"semog itua bisa mengurangi rasa nyerimu, cepat lah sembuh ne?\" jinki tersenyum kearah gweboon, \"ehm..\" suara deheman membuat lovey dovey jinki dan gweboon terhenti. \"maap aku mengganggu kemesraan kalian\" ucap yunho \"hanya saja ini rumah sakit, dan jinki kau membolos disini rupanya\" jinki dan gweboon merasa malu dengan yunho yang notabennya adalah ayah dari mereka berdua. ani, maksudnya ayah mertua gweboon dan ayah kandung jinki. \"aku tidak ingin meninggalkan istriku sendiri hanya karena rapat appa\" \"jinki…\"desis gweboon. \"miane appa\" gweboon mencoba meminta maap. \"gwenchana, hahaha….appa hanya bercanda\" yunho mendekat kearah mereka berdua, setelah berbicara dengan seulgi dan menutup pintunya. \"gweboon malam ini kau akan pulang, kau tidak usah khawatir kau baik-baik saja\" \"jinja appa?\" \"eum..jangan lupa untuk terus cek up luka jahitanmu\" \"ne appa\" \"dan kau jinki\" yunho kini memandang jinki \"kau bisa cuti selama gweboon sakit, biar dokter mark yang mengurusi bagian anastesi\" \"yes appa, aku mencintaimu\" jinki tersenyum sumringah \"dan satu hal lagi jinki, kau tidak boleh memaksa gweboon untuk melakukan itu sebelum benar-benar lukanya sembuh\" \"a..araso..\" END typo(s) flat miaaan….

I then got hugged by everyone in the room, Shook Mr Wesley's hand and Mrs Weasley pulled me into a bone crushing hug \"How is Ginny?\" \"exhausted but doing great she's with James right now he was asleep when I left I better get back Teddy is anxious to meet James and I have many letters to send with our owl. \" \"Leave us a list dear we can do it there are plenty of us with family owls that can send the notice\" \"Thanks make sure Hagrid is first I promised he would be first after family and of course I can't apparate into Hogwarts grounds.\" I received one last hug from Mrs Weasley then apparated home. To find Ginny James and Teddy all asleep in their beds/cribs. I gently lifted James being careful not to wake him I sat down in the chair in his nursery and rocked him just as I imagined my father had to me. The next week we took him over to the Burrow to meet his family or for them to meet him considering he would probably never remember it. Mrs Weasley was the doting grandmother to all of her grandchildren she barely let anyone else hold him including me or Ginny. George brought a box of toys Fred was to old for now. \"I can't wait until he's old enough for his first toy broomstick\" \"that's a while off yet mate\" I laughed. \"We could get little Freddie one though and he can race Teddy\" \"and his other cousins\" Bill added from behind. We all laughed as Teddy Victorie Dom and Louis flew past our knees in the back yard. George turned to go back inside of the house. \"wheres dad? Mother wants him\" Percy asked abruptly. \"where else in the shed messing with that bike of Sirius's for Hagrid\" Ron replied. \"so when are you and Hermione going to add to our family Ron?\" \"Dunno really she's a bit mental already a bit scared she'll get even more mental if shes pregnant but soon I spose wouldn't want our kid going to Hogwarts on their own want some cousins there with them.\" We all laughed and continued to talk about a variety of topics mainly Quidditch I was always questioned on why I decided to become an Auror instead of playing Pro Quidditch like Ginny had for the Holyhead Harpies, While I had killed Voldemort and we had rounded up many of his followers there were still many out there. I had learned that Lucius Malfoy had died not long after the Battle of Hogwarts leaving just Narcissa and Draco. Ron had also become an Auror and Hermione was in the Magical Law Enforcement Office at the Ministry. \"So Bill any more plans for more kids?\" \"Nah threes enough besides we have to decide which school they will go to I mean I'd love them to go to Hogwarts at least Louis will, but I think Fleur will want the girls to go to Beauxbatons but in the end I think she'll agree that all the Weasley and Potters should go to school together.\" \"McGonagall has promised to come and visit James before term starts I always knew she should be head of school it would be almost like Snape never was now.\" \"She sent us an owl the other day asking how we were\" Ron added \"It was addressed to both of us too I was so tempted to ask her if we could go and visit the school and Hagrid he's not like the other teachers he cant just jump on a broom or travel by Floo it'd have to be a bloody big fireplace.\" \"we sent him a photo of James he was ecstatic I promised I'd send him one of James and Me he wants one to put on his wall next to the photo of Grawp I think by the time James is old enough for school there wont be any room left on the inside of Hagrids cabin for photos.\" We all laughed It was times like this that I felt truly accepted as a Weasley. The next minute we heard a crack and George had apparated right in front of where I was standing instinctively I took a step back \"sorry mate\" \"you still Apparate everywhere I thought you'd grown out of that by now\" \"yeah well mum was having another go about dads non-magical junk I had to get out of the house without her seeing me and finding something that I had done to say something about.\" Hermione approached us \"Ron your mother says lunch is ready oh and Harry Ginny wants you to have a go at putting James down for a nap she says your best at it already\" we all nodded and did as we needed too. Once James was napping I joined everyone at the table in the garden (the house was too small for us all to eat in) after lunch the older kids all went down for naps too. My favourite place in the world away from Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place the Weasley's house the Burrow my second home.

She had new years and her birthday to look forward to in the next few days but she knew she needed that extra something to make it special. It was the 28th December and she was on Facebook talking to her best friend. Her best friend told her about this guy who was chatting to her on Facebook. This guy was one of the people in the friends group at college, Danielle had always thought he was quite cute but she thought he hated her, little did she know he liked her a whole lot more than that, he was just too shy to show it. Danielle decided to send this guy a friends request on Facebook she searched Liam and found him, he accepted the request almost instantly. A few minutes later Danielle received a message, it only said hey and seemed innocent enough. Not long into this chat they started talking about the people they fancied at college, Danielle told Liam she didn't fancy anyone and this disappointed Liam, he'd finally found a girl who was funny to talk to and who he already liked, Liam was too scared to come right out and tell Danielle about his feelings so he tried to make it obvious but well hidden. He made her guess he asked her who she thought was the girl he fancied, her first guess Cristy (her best friend) was the obvious one, who he had been speaking to earlier on as he was trying to come out of his shell and finally make some new friends, he told her that that was not the right answer. Then she guessed again, her second guess Emma was someone he didn't even know, he asked who and after her description finally clocked on, he was disgusted that she thought that was his type, oh and the fact she was lesbian would have made that one a bit hard for him. Her third and final guess was Lucia, the teenage single mum. Liam was almost annoyed at her for suggesting this, she decided to give up and Liam couldn't believe Danielle hadn't noticed he was talking about her. Liam decided the only way he was going to get this girl to understand he liked her was to try and get her out on a date which she wouldn't know was a date. He asked her if she wanted to come round to his house whilst his parents were away, he had alcohol and pizza and thought she might enjoy it, she said she couldn't but that he should ask someone else. The truth was Liam didn't want anyone else he wanted Danielle to come round. Then he decided to tell her about a cinema voucher he had been given for Christmas, he had £10 which would be just about enough to get them both into a film, he didn't make it too obvious that he wanted her to go so just told her he had no one to go with and that he needed more friends, she first advised him to take Ethan, (another boy from the friends group) Liam laughed this off as Ethan was well known for taking drugs which is something Liam did not want to be associated with, then she suggested his cousin who he had been drinking with that night. Again Liam didn't want to go with another person, he wanted to treat Danielle to a really nice night. Liam eventually came to the conclusion that Danielle didn't want to go out with him and was trying in the nicest way possible to turn down any possibility to go out with Liam, at about 3AM Danielle said good night to Liam and decided to go to bed, Liam hadn't given up all hope but knew his chances of getting Danielle who he thought was beautiful with her black dyed hair, to go out with him were very slim. The next day, both of the teenagers still felt awkward and scared of starting a conversation with each other. Eventually Danielle plucked up the courage to message Liam. She knew that he had been drinking the previous night and knew that this was the perfect way to break the tension. She started the conversation with a simple hey and Liam was so excited to hear from this girl who he thought had no interest, he replied with an identical hey. She then went on to ask him if he was hungover, this once again started a conversation about how much they both liked to drink. Danielle told Liam about how her favourite alcoholic drink was vodka and energy drink, so Liam replied telling her his favourite was the very similar vodka and coke. Liam told Danielle about how he had been drinking carling the previous night and how although he didn't enjoy drinking lager he would drink it as it was alcoholic. Liam then told her about a drink he had created where he had a shot of vodka topped with squirt cream, this wasn't nice and burnt a lot more than normal vodka. They then entered a strange conversation about a hat Liam had bought in the Boxing Day sales, it was a propeller hat which had cost him £5 from River Island. Liam couldn't believe Danielle actually seemed to be enjoying this conversation. They kept talking all day and the next day they started talking about things which were actually personal. They were talking about how far they had gone with guys and girls, Danielle revealed to Liam that she had kissed her one and only boyfriend only to be surprised when Liam replied that he had never even had a girlfriend and had never done anything, although he was very embarrassed to tell her something about her made him feel that he could trust her with this. Danielle told Liam that it was the cutest thing she had ever heard. Liam really wanted Danielle to be his first girlfriend as he had never gotten on with anyone this well, usually he would get sick of talking to people after about 5 minutes but it was different with Danielle. The big day was here New Year's Eve. Both of the teenagers had very boring days planned, Liam was planning on going to his sister's house alongside her boyfriend and her boyfriend's brother. Danielle was staying at home with her family knowing the following day would not only be New Year's Day but also her birthday. They both felt much more comfortable starting a conversation with each other now and it seemed as soon as they woke up the first thing they wanted to do was message the other. This time it was Liam who gave the daily hey, and Danielle who gave the hey back. Both of the two were planning on having a lot of drinks that night and Liam knew when he was more confident he would finally reveal to Danielle the truth about his feelings. As soon as Liam arrived at his sisters his sister knew something was going on (Gemma). Gemma straight away asked why he was so happy, he hid it, and he didn't want to seem stupid if nothing happened but Gemma saw right through this. She asked if he had a special friend, this quickly turned into a big thing and she was demanding pictures but Liam did very well to hide the identity of Danielle, Gemma strangely went through Liam's friends list asking about every girl, when she said Danielle's name Liam had to hide the biggest smile ever. Over at Danielle's house she was also getting questions and just as Liam was she was hiding it, although she was hiding that there was a guy altogether, Liam was just hiding the identity. Midnight approached and Liam could feel the tipsiness, he had been drinking all sorts of drinks and the sour shots were what broke the barrier as he started to become quite drunk, this was the time it happened, Liam messaged Danielle and restarted the conversation about who they liked at college, Liam just came out with \"I like you Danielle\", this shocked Danielle and she didn't realise it, she replied telling him she liked him to but wanted to get to know him, she wasn't getting a reply so she sent another message saying sorry and she didn't want to sound like a twat. Eventually Liam replied saying happy new year and happy birthday, Liam was very drunk now so he didn't reply again as he didn't even know what he was doing, eventually he revealed the identity which resulted in Gemma's boyfriends brother (Dale) sending a message, he said to her \"hey hun, I really like you and I think we should start spending time together outside college\" Danielle saw the message but didn't reply, she knew this wasn't liam because he wouldn't call her hun. Liam fell asleep and when he woke up the next morning didn't remember dale sending this message he was very quick to apologise to Danielle and make sure she knew it wasn't him.

When I took a single breath it burned my lungs and I had to balance myself against the door frame to keep from passing out. I slowly walked through the door to see our newly bought trailer cluttered with empty bottles. The fridge door was wide open letting in a chill of cool air. \"Dammit.\" I mumbled as I approached the kitchen. My dad's home from his \"Business trip.\" That's what he calls them, Even though he doesn't even have a job anymore, after he got fired from his last one. He can't hold a steady job for more than two or three months. The last one he had, he worked for a cleaning supply company bottling window cleaner. Now, all he does is drink up all our money my mother makes working at the good will donation center. I hear the heavy snoring of my father on the couch. I walk over to the back of the couch and look over to find my dad sprawled out, with one leg hanging off the edge, hugging an unopened bottle of Jack Daniels. \"That's sad\" I whisper to myself, as I walked back to the kitchen to grab my phone I left at home to charge when I left for school. I see it unplugged and turned on. I knew he would go through my messages; I have no privacy once so ever when it comes to my dad, and I know after he wakes up from his beauty sleep, he's going to bombard me with abrasive questions that are private. I have to answer them though; if I don't it'll be hell. I stand there for a few seconds and think about what he's going to do when my mom gets home. I push the thoughts aside and quickly retreat to my room. I gather my bag full of necessities, my journal, pens, water, snacks and my IPod. I could never live without my music, as I exit my room I still see my dad lying there on the couch. \"You sicken me.\" I hear myself say. In my mind, I think of ways to get back at him, revenge. I promised myself long ago when he gave me a nasty black eye, that I wouldn't let him get away with this. He would pay for what he's done to my mom and me. As I pull out from my trance, I hear a car pull up. Michel, thank god, he's here to pick me up so we can go volunteer at the animal shelter. I run out the door and breathe a sigh of relief when I see his red Chevy pickup truck parked in my drive way. I love his old truck, even though he thinks it's a piece of junk. It has a dent in the passenger side door the size of a soccer ball and a crack in the windshield coming from the top and reaching the bottom. It also smells like a combination of brunt popcorn and wet dog, but to me it smells like safety. When I'm in his truck, I know nothing can hurt me, not my dad, my mom, nothing. He rolled down the window and said hop in. I through open the door and quickly buckled up. \"What's the hurry?\" Michel asked with a slight hint of concern on his face. \"Oh nothing.\" I lied, because there was something. I just turned away, leaned my head against the cool glass and closed my eyes. He placed the key into the ignition, but he still didn't turn on the truck. I looked up at him after a minute \"What are you doing?\" I said. He turned and looked at me with those deep, beautiful brow eyes of his that always hypnotized me when I look into them. \"Beth, Please tell me what wrong.\" He asked in a voice that sounded like a soothing lullaby. \"Why do you think there's something wrong?\" I replied with a bitter tone. All he did was roll his eyes and said \"Fine, don't tell me.\" It was kind of shocking to hear him ask me that question. He's never asked me that before, did I really look that worked up. I looked down at my hands to see them shaking violently and I quickly covered them with my bag, as I looked back up at him I found him staring at my hands that were still shaking. He looked up at me with worry and just said \"You're a bad liar.\" He started up the car and turned it to my favorite radio station 92.9; they were playing some Miranda Lambert \"The house that built me\". I just leaned back into the seat and tried to relax, after a minute or two of controlled breathing, I stopped shaking and just listened to the music, and fell asleep.

By this time Reverend Hale had left to go back to his own village, only to some back everyone once in a while to check up on the state of the town or to listen to once of Reverend Parris' sermons. All in all, most of the talk had left along with Abigail Williams leaving. Abigail Williams and Mary Warren had just returned to Salem. Their clothes were dirty and they were terribly skinny. While trying to get to Barbados things had not gone well for them. They were happy just to be back in Salem. The two girls had walked into the town only to see that it had remained the same while they were gone. The only real difference might have been some snow melting on the ground and a feeling that there were a few less people residing here. They were people that they knew they had helped condemn. ABIGAIL WILLIAMS, walking up to the church. She stops and thinks for a moment while listening to the music coming from the building. The voices could be heard singing songs of praise to God. The people sounded like their moods had been highly elevated ever since the witch trials had ended. Opening up the door and making sure she had everyone's attention she yells: \"I'm back!\" PARRIS, everyone in the room grows silent as their singing is cut short. It seemed that just Abigail's entrance had made all the people in the room become uneasy, their attitudes completely changed. Muttering about her arrival begins. \"What are you doing here?\" He asks nervously. ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"The devil had brought me out of Salem, but I have returned to God once more and come back to Salem as well. Just in the time I've been back Sprits have already thrown themselves upon me. There are still witches in Salem and God has bid me back here to show them to you.\" Everyone in the church begins to speak in hushed tones to themselves about what could be going on. PARRIS, holding up his hand to silence the church-goers: \"How are you going to do that?\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"I will do it by clearing the names of the innocent and calling out the names of those that should have been accused earlier.\" DANFORTH, now standing up in the midst of the people: \"Who would the innocent be that were wrongly accused?\" ABIGAIL WILLAIMS: \"Rebecca Nurse, Sarah Good, John Proctor,\" She stops to look around the room before continuing, \"Where is John Proctor?\" ELIZABETH PROCTOR, now standing up as well: \"John is dead.\" DANFORTH, ignoring Elizabeth: \"Who wasn't accused that should have been?\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"Putman and his wife, Reverend Hale and his wife, and lastly Elizabeth Proctor, who for some reason you, seem to not be able to keep in a jail.\" PUTMAN, quickly getting to his feet: \"How dare you accuse me?\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: it is by God's will that I accuse you; I won't deny what God has told me to do.\" HALE , getting up and joining them : \"And how do you accuse me?\" PARRIS , now against Abigail : \"Yes, how? Reverend Hale has done all he can to help the village. How do you think there is any sign of devil in him?\" ABIGAIL WILLAIMS, yelling now : \"He knows more about witchcraft than anyone else. Who's to say that he isn't a witch himself?\" HALE: \"I know more because I've studied the most out of anyone in the area. I've traveled and seen different witch cases from all around. In most places they would burn the accused witches and make them suffer until their death instead of a simple hanging. Even without that in consideration, I am a minister and you should know that the Devil cannot get to a minister.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"You allowed John Proctor, an innocent man, to be hanged. That sounds more like the Devil's work than something that would have been done by God's will.\" HALE: \"I did not condemn John Proctor! He condemned himself with his pride.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"Even if he did die for his pride instead of witchcraft it's still wrong. He was a good man, innocent of anything cruel. His wife should have been the one hanging.\" DANFORTH, interrupting: \"Elizabeth has been found innocent. Even if Proctor hadn't have been punished for witchcraft he would still have had to be punished for the crime of lechery he committed with you.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS, now becoming extremely defensive and it showing in her voice: \"There is no proof of that!\" DANFORTH: \"Aye, there is. John admitted it himself. If I recall correctly you have just claimed that he was a good man, John, and that he never did anything cruel. Surely a good man wouldn't lie, so why shouldn't we believe what he has openly confessed before his death?\" Pause. ABIGAIL WILLIAMS, calming : \"Sir, he is a good man, but sometimes even good men lie.\" DANFORTH , matching Abigail's tone : \"There you are wrong. Good men need not lie.\" HALE, joining the argument once more, but now taking Abigail's side : \"He had to lie to confess to witchcraft. There are many good men and women even in this room that had to lie to save their own lives.\" DANFORTH, to Abigail: \"See, even if Proctor hadn't been executed for witchcraft he would have had to been punished for lechery and being a blasphemer. You could, and should, be punished for the same.\" PARRIS, speaking rapidly and franticly : \"Please, all of you, this is a church not a courtroom! If you're going to charge someone of something don't do it here.\" DANFORTH , ignoring Parris' outburst : \"For lechery you could get a whipping, maybe an 'A' on your clothes for the rest of your life. For blasphemy you might only get branded. You could admit to your crimes now and possibly get a lesser sentence or you can keep on with your lies and go to court instead and get a harsher punishment for not cooperating now.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"I will not admit to anything.\" DANFORTH , solemnly : \"Then perhaps we should leave to the court now.\" HALE , sounding as angry as when John Proctor was sentenced for a crime that he didn't do, to Danforth : Haven't enough people been in court these last few months, all against their will, forced to confess something that they may or may not have done? Why should we start this again? Haven't enough people been hurt from the witch trails? Can't we finally put all of this behind us and start new?\" DANFORTH, to Hale: \"Justice can never quit Reverend Hale. If we let it stop now it will come back even stronger as it did with the witches. If these were different crimes, if she was convicted of murder, would you still want it to pass with as much proof as we have now?\" Pause. DANFORTH, continuing : \" We would convict a murderer with blood on their hands. I see no reason why we shouldn't convict a blasphemer with a lie on their tongue.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS , to Danforth, trying to remain calm : \"There is no lie on my tongue, sir.\" DANFORTH , turning to Abigail : \" You say there be no lie on your tongue but when you first came in you admitted to lying before. If that were a lie, and this are not, then you still lie either way. You've condemned yourself from the start.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"I do not lie now sir.\" DANFORTH: \"If you do not lie now, you lied then. Which is it?\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS: \"I will not confess to either. If you make me confess to anything I will leave this church, never to return to Salem.\" DANFORTH: \"Fine. If you will not confess you may consider yourself banished from the village. Leave now.\" ABIGAIL WILLIAMS : instantly filled with rage : \"You can't banish me!\" DANFORTH , remaining calm through her sudden anger : \"It is either banishment or court. You may choose.\" Everyone in the church stands up to stare at Abigail wondering what she is going to do next. Abigail stands silently for a few moments, and then without hesitation, she dramatically storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her. The curtain closes. She left to be hardly ever seen again until she was found in Boston, years later, working as a prostitute. The End.

Not white paint, but light emanating from the walls. It was so bright that I could hardly see. After a few seconds, it got easier to open my eyes and I started looking around. The room was bare apart from these black barrels that were stacked up against the walls. They had little windows on the front, so that you could see inside. I look inside one of them and, at first, didn't see anything. I knew this was all really weird, but that's why I'd gone there in the first place, y'know?My Grandmother told me that there was something bad there, but I didn't listen. I wanted to see it for myself. I thought that maybe I could do something, because of our family history, you know? All of sudden I start to hear a tapping noise coming from inside the barrel so I leaned in closer, desperate to see inside. The thing inside came at me, nearly hard enough to knock the barrel clean over. Then it starting making this...awful noise. It was low down, angry. Mean. Like an animal with rabies must sound. I nearly jumped out of my skin, but I managed not to call out. As scared as I was of this thing, it didn't compare to what Grandma told me about the Tall Man. She said that he didn't just want your life. He wanted your body and your soul too. She told me that he wasn't from here. Grandma used to tell me that our family came from across the ocean over a hundred years ago, and that's all she'd say. I heard a few of my older relatives talking once, at a wedding. The language they were speaking sounded kind of like Russian to me, but I'm no expert. She taught me all the things my Mother was supposed to learn. She'd had a hard time dealing with the \"gifts\" our family has, couldn't block out the unwanted thoughts. So she got lost, geographically and metaphorically. The last we heard of her she was somewhere out in California, reading palms on the beach for whatever money she could hustle. Our family had come to the town and stayed because of the Tall Man. My Great-Grandmother had sensed the evil of the place, and thought it our moral obligation to try and negate it. Or at least contain it. So that's what we did for a long time, until I disappeared. You told my that my Grandma passed away in 1980, and that it's 1989 now. That means the Tall Man has been loose for nearly ten years by now. Anyway; I was in the room and this... dwarf in a hooded robe appears from nowhere and attacks me. I'm trying to fight him off and, as we're struggling, I notice these two silver poles that are sticking up out of the floor. I managed to throw the thing against one of them, and I think I broke it's back. I watched it writhing around on the floor yelping in pain and I felt kind of sorry for it. I was about to lift it's hood back when I heard a rush of footsteps coming towards me. I turned around and saw more of those things, about half a dozen, all closing in on me. One of them launched itself at me and hit me in the chest, throwing me backwards. I screamed out loud for the first time. Everything changed. The place I found myself in was strange – literally alien. The sky was red and, for as far as I could see, the ground was nothing but rocks. I tried to stand up but it was hard. The gravity there was different, a lot stronger than here on Earth. Soon I realised that's why the Tall man was making the dwarves – to prepare them for that world. There were black barrels and dwarves everywhere, they almost seemed shocked to see me there. For a while they just stood and watched me. I tried to run but couldn't even get to my feet. They quickly descended and tied me up. They carried me above their heads, as if I were a prize or a wild boar. I lost consciousness after a while, and when I came again, there was a city. Still far away but definitely a city. The tallest buildings were the only ones I could make out. They were what you'd call skyscrapers but instead of looking orderly and geometrically sound, they were like clawing fingers. Black, sharp fingers stretching up toward the sky. As I began contemplating what might happen to me when we reached the city, a commotion broke out. I heard a few sharp cracks and was soon cast to the ground. I was lying on my side and saw a few of the dwarves fall sideways, apparently dead. The rest scattered, squawking in fear. I felt my bonds being cut and slowly got to my feet as best I could. The people that had freed me were the same size as the dwarves but they didn't hide their faces. They looked like small humans, the tallest of which was four and a half feet. They were pretty uniform in their appearance; most had dark black hair and honey coloured eyes. We couldn't communicate by speaking, so I followed their motioning hands. They led me to a cave opening which led to a warren of tunnels. I followed them, barely able to keep up. As I was losing all motion and energy, we emerged in to an opening where there were beds and food, and a fire. I collapsed and blacked out, the little people looking down on me fascinated. I felt someone stroke my hair. That's where I lived for the next seven years. I soon got the hang of their language, and most of the people in my cave learned enough English to get by with me. I learned that my hosts were opposing the tall man and his army. Their whole planet was not always the way it was when I arrived Once, apparently, it had been just like Earth. Earth when it was nice. Oceans, forests, that type of things. Then the Tall Man had risen and war had broken out. The weapons used by both sides had turned the planet to near dust. The Tall Man had taken to abusing their technology to recruit soldiers from Earth and other planets. My hosts introduced to what they called 'The Lengthener'. It was something more advanced than a medieval stretching rack, but the same principle. People on the planet used it to squeeze a few extra inches out of their frames. Height meant prestige there. I learned from my hosts that the planet's gravity would reduce my height by about a sixteenth of an inch a day. With the help of the lengthener, I was able to avoid coming back to Earth child-sized. Over the next nine years, I fought side by side with the cave dwellers against the Tall Man's armies. Sometimes we won, sometimes we lost. Eventually, we wore them down and stormed the city. We smashed his infernal palace and found the portal that could return me to earth. I bid farewell to my kind, brave friend and took the leap. 'And that's how you found yourself wandering in the crematorium at three AM?' The tone of the cop's voice was condescending, to say the least. 'Yeah.' She rolled her eyes and let him know she didn't give a shit if he believed or not. 'Well...' He sighed, 'We can't really charge you with anything other than trespassing. You sound like you've had it rough kid, So I'd like to give you a break. Just tell me one thing...' 'Shoot.' She said, itching to get out of the station and start her war again. 'What's your name?' The cop asked, closing his notebook. He got up from his seat, his jacket folded over his arm. 'You can call me Star.' She replied, getting up from her seat. He looked over the tattoo on her cheek. 'Fair enough.' He opened the door for her, and she breezed by towards the front doors of the station. 'Good Luck, Star.' The cop called to her. 'It's not me who needs it!' She shouted back. With that, she disappeared into the night outside. ","Summary":" The Fortune Teller's Granddaughter The room was white.

He always loved me, and kept on teasing, flirting with me, and I remained clueless until the day he kissed me and told me he loved me and we started going out. Right now, I was heading home, and as usual, he was following me. \"Leave me alone and go home, you stalker!\" I said angrily. \"Don't wanna\" he said casually. \"What's with you?\" \"I just wanna spend time with my girlfriend…\" he came up behind me and embraced me, whispering in my ear \"Do you think your house it'll be empty?\" I was red, and pushed him away. \"You pervert!\" \"Let's go to the park.\" He said. I sighed \"No, Hanabishi. I'm going home.\" \"Are you sleepy?\" I heaved another sigh \"Yes, I'm sleepy.\" \"Then I'll stay by Aio's bed and watch her sleep.\" He said simply. \"No! Miyabi's is home!\" He smirked \"So if she wasn't there, you would-\" \"Aargh, shut up, you perv!\" \"I'm your best friend, Aio. At least in front of your sister. A best friend can watch his best friend sleep, right?\" he grinned \"I don't care if she misunderstands things .\" And he entered my house. \"H-hey, wait a second!\" I cried but he was deaf to my words. Miyabi opened the door with her usual blank look and said \"Mom's not here.\" Then she looked at Hanabishi- then at me and said \"Warn me beforehand if you're planning on making love.\" And went off, just like that! \"N-NO! Miyabi!\" I cried, but Hanabishi carried me up my bedroom saying \"Thank you, Miyabi.\" He put me on my bed, lowered his head and gently put his lips on the nape of my neck and bit, then softly licked the part to soothe me as I let out a small gasp. I knew he was smirking is head off. I pushed him off \"H-Hanabishi, I c-can't-\" He looked down \"What? I'm your boyfriend. I can give my girlfriend a hickey.\" \"What if Miyabi came up suddenly?\" \"So what?\" \"It's embarrassing!\" He scoffed \"Fine, I won't do that again. Goodnight, then.\" And he turned to get out the house. I had upset him. He was such a child, but he looked so cut then. \"Hey, come one. Turn around.\" I caught his wrist. He stopped and scowled \"I won't.\" \"Hanabishi, when I said it was embarrassing, I meant it in a good way.\" \"..You liked it!\"He cried, whizzing around and smirking at me. I blushed and looked away \"Okay, so I didn't hate it.\" \"Want me to do it again?\" I pushed him away \"PERVERT!\" He laughed, then took my back and pulling me towards him, kissed me on the lips. We stayed in each others arms like that for a long time, then he backed away, and put his palm on my cheek, smirking \"Goodnight, Aio.\" I had his shirt in my fists and was blushing furiously as he smiled down at me, still holding me in his embrace. \"Good night, Hanabishi-sama…\" I managed to say.

Bueno, serán muchas las veces en que me varán dentro de este fandom, ya que me considero una gran fan de la película y tengo bastantes escritos sobre Tracy, los cuales estoy ansiosa por subir. Hope you like it :3 &. Miré por última vez mi brazo, mientras intentaba no respirar. No quería sentir de nuevo el asfixiante olor de la sangre. No quería recordar las mil y una veces que había estado en este mismo escenario, junto aquel objeto corto punzante, intentando solucionar los problemas que me atormentaban. Simplemente, me atemorizaba la idea. Aunque aquellas memorias dieran vueltas por mi cabeza a menudo. Tomé una vez más la tijera, la acerqué a mi muñeca y dibujé un trazo por encima de la piel, para después pasar con más firmeza el filo, y revelar ante mis ojos el líquido rojo que ya me era familiar, pero que aún no dejaba de sorprenderme. El color de la sangre parecía ser cada vez más brillante, maravillando –o espantando—a mis ojos. También me impactaba su densidad, la cual hacía que cada gota se deslizara con una tortuosa lentitud por mi brazo, para finalizar en aquella pequeña toalla que guardaba cada rastro de los infinitos momentos en que necesité la autodestrucción para poder conciliar el sueño por la noche. ¡Qué fácil es hacer esto! Me corto, elimino todo rastro de sangre, improviso una venda y me puedo ir a dormir plácidamente, sin pesadillas. Puedo llevar una vida normal si me lo propongo.

Pensé en Evie. Me debería estar esperando. Tengo que ir donde ella. La necesito ahora más que nunca. Necesito de su droga.

Evie Zamora was standing in front of me with a small smile. \"Tracy\" she breathed out happily as she leaned against the locker next to mine. I slammed the locker shut and walked off trying my best to ignore her. But she followed me quickly and grabbed me by the wrist holding me in place. \"Tracy wait\" she said in a huff. I stopped and looked at her with clenched teeth. \"What do you want Evie\" I spat her name out like the most horrible disease on this planet. \"I wanted to talk to you\" she said lowly. \"Well I don't want to talk to you so fuck off\" I told her venomously as I yanked my arm out of her grasp running to the bathroom. She stood there in the middle of the school hallways staring at the spot where Tracy just left. What happened why would she hate me Evie thought melancholy to herself. I ran into the bathroom gripping the sink roughly. I dropped my head freaking out now, why the hell is she back now everything has been just getting back to normal now she's here to fuck everything up that bitch! I than felt the need hit me suddenly mentally knocking me over. I knew than that all the three months of recovery was about to go down the drain in this minute. I took the compact out of my bag quickly dropping it to the ground as I stomped on it. Causing it to shatter into pieces. I knelt down to pick up one long sharpened piece. I threw the rest away and went into the bathroom stall so no one would see me again. I sobbed soundlessly as I let the piece of glass pierce my arm scraping it across my inner arm not caring anymore. As I pulled away I grabbed a bunch of toilet paper pressing it against the wound so it would stop bleeding. Soon enough I felt the pain bloom throughout my bloodstream causing a rush inside of me. I knew than that I would feel better. I soon got it to stop bleeding, I knew everyone was currently in class. I walked silently to my locker grabbing my hoodie to cover it up. I didn't feel like going to class now, so the best day to ditch. I shoved my crap in the locker and ran out of the school ignoring the yells of people telling me to come back from behind me. The faster I ran the more it started to all fade. I fell to the sidewalk not able to make it. My head dropped in shame as the tears leaked out silently. I decided to go home since Mason wasn't home and mom was at work most definitely. I went into our bathroom remembering my old hiding spot. I let out a ragged breath as I scraped the small blade against my skin as light as a feather. But the light touch of the blade caused a line of blood to bloom from under the surface. I smirked happily glad to feel the pain finally if only Evie somehow could feel the pain I feel everyday because of her. Every emotion in my life suddenly got magnified when Evie came into my life ruining everything. As soon as I was able to get the wound to stop bleeding I put on my sweater and went back to the school to see it was now lunch. I saw Noel come up to me with a frown slightly. \"Where were you\" she asked not bothering to skip the chit chat. \"I went out sorry\" I said lowly she was barely able to hear it. \"So Evie came back\" she said making conversation as we were in the lunch line. \"Yes I noticed I could honestly care less about what that bitch does with her fucked up life\" I spat out to myself not paying attention really. \"Woe what's got you pissed off\" she asked stopping as we reached our regular lunch table with Yumi. \"You wanna ask that question again\" I asked sarcastically. \"Oh well don't worry if you ignore her she'll leave you alone if you don't do anything to her or say anything\" Noel said reassuringly. \"Ok hold up what's going on explain from the beginning\" Yumi cut in nosily wanting to know what was going on like always. \"Evie is back\" Noel answered for her easily. I than saw Yumi's eyes freeze over by the sound of her name. She stared at me silently asking me not to go back to her. \"Don't worry\" I answered her silent plead. \"I gotta go\" I said suddenly as I got up dumping my tray. I walked in the hallway no one was around and till Evie came out of nowhere. \"Tracy wait up\" she said running after me as I ran the other direction. She stopped me in place forcing me to look at her. \"Why are you so upset that I'm back I thought you would be happy\" she blurted out ignorantly. I chuckled to myself as I finally looked at her gaining all of my confidence back. \"No Evie I'm not matter of face I wish you will go die because I fucking hate you\" I said whispering to her like she was a little 5-year old. I saw her face drop but she soon composed herself into a hard icy glare. \"You may want me dead and hate me Tracy, but guess what\" she asked sadistically. I looked at her as she stopped in front of me again. \"Without me you're nothing I created you, I can easily end you\" she threatened lowly. I than laughed out covering up my hurt on the inside. \"You think I'm scared of you\" I asked incredulously. She didn't say anything which gave me my answer. \"I'm not Evie honestly I don't care about you so just leave me alone and stop ruining my life\" I spat out at her as I ran back to my house. As soon as I got there I went into the kitchen. I let the tears fall I let my psycho emo bitch come out as I grabbed one of the kitchen knives from the set. I than did something that surprised myself I took it and shoved it roughly in my stomach twisting it around sadistically. I fell to the ground and rode all the way to hell where people just like me belonged. Sorry I just wanted to write this sorry about the stupid ending but my friend wanted me to write a story for thirteen and I have wanted to for a while so I decided to write this I'm going to write more one-shots or short stories on here about the movie because honestly that movie was mazing and it doesn't get enough credit.

Aunque su parecido, locuras, desenfrenos era algo que no cambiaba. ¡Tenían trece! ¡Tenían que vivir la vida! Aun eran muy jóvenes para amargase. Evie no dejaría que eso pasara, Tracy no permitiría que su amistad se acabara Porque ella de vez en cuando susurraba «Tranquila, Tracy, todo estará bien» confiando en sus propias palabras. La juventud no duraba toda la vida, después de todo, no eran vampiras. Morirían algún día y cada quien tomaría su vida a partir de los 15. Porque ambas madurarían, ambas olvidarían los trece desenfrenados que vivieron juntas. Solo, de vez en cuando, lo recordarían. Tracy sabía que dentro de poco cumpliría los catorce, eso arruinaría su vida. Envejecería un año más y estaría más cerca de poder perder a Evie para tomar su vida en serio. Porque ellas se amaban, como tal vez nadie se amaba. Tracy solo quería popularidad al principio y había conseguido, definitivamente, mundo más que eso. Había conseguido el amor y la amistad. Y, por fin, había aprendido a vivir sus trece años. Y, si, se besaba con Evie de vez en cuando ¿Había, acaso, un castigo por eso? ¡Solo eran adolescentes experimentando los sabores de la vida! Y eso no estaba prohibido en ninguna religión ni ningún país ¡Era la adolescencia! No era nada, ni menos, que eso. ¡Eran los trece! ¡Era la rebeldía! ¡Era el amor y el experimentar cosas nuevas!

Era una amistad. ¡Una de verdad! Ninguna de las dos cambiaria eso pero el destino si tenía preparado cambiarlo. Un cambio radical que dañaría sus vidas Y, por eso, esa última noche; Evie le susurro algo a Tracy, como solía hacerlo, mientras dormía: «Descansa hermosa y recuerda que siempre estaré contigo en la historia de tu vida» y con un beso escondido Evie había jurado algo que estaba dispuesta a conseguir: Jamás olvidar a Tracy durante su vida. Ella se levanto de la cama viendo a Tracy por última vez antes del día de mañana, una lágrima traicionera rodo por su mejilla y sonrió cuando, en sueños, Tracy susurro: «Te amo, Evie»; y con eso sonrió, solo eso le faltaba por escuchar para saber que Tracy era su niña.

Tracey's his little sister, and that means she fucking winds him up, and they scream at each other and if anyone shoves her in the corridor at school, it's his job to shove them back. He's her brother. But that's all he is. And this is something he can't stop. It doesn't matter if Tracey's drinking every three hours, 'til she's staggering around looking like some junkie from the street corners. It doesn't matter if she's sneaking out with Evie Zamora to snort coke in the kids' playground. It doesn't matter if she's dressing up til she looks like a fucking prostitute and then parading round downtown, leaning on thirty something year old's shoulders and sticking cigarettes in her mouth. It doesn't matter if he hates the fact she does it, hates watching her turn into some fucking strung-out doll, some permanently trashed junkie who staggers around with mascara-smeared eyes and that too-wide smile, someone who keeps her sleeves yanked down over her wrists, someone whose lipstick stains her mouth like blood.

He knows that Mom's freaked out about everything, that she's been freaked out since the day months ago-Christ, it seems so much longer-when Tracey chucked her old Barbies in the trash, when Tracey dumped half of her old clothes and announced she needed a new wardrobe. He knows that Mom didn't want Tracey at Evie's, so Evie came here. And OK, when Evie Zamora was dancing around outside his window, yanking her shirt up, grinning at him, he might have gone along with it. Because it was Evie Zamora, for Christ's sake. And it was OK for her to be that way because she was nothing to do with him. He might want her to be, for five minutes or something, but she wasn't and he knew that. But Tracey was, and Tracey wasn't like Evie. Or at least, she shouldn't have been. Over the past few months, it's been like watching the sister he knew-the kid with the pigtails, the kid who scribbled poetry in her notebooks, the kid who brought home straight As, the kid who was always hanging around him-get sucked away. Not just vanish, get sucked out, like someone else has moved into her body, some fucking too-young temptress with a hole through her tongue and her panties showing, some pierced body with smoke curling out her lips and no memory of yesterday or the day before or the day before that. And he watches and he yells at her, and when he sees her downtown with some thong designed for fucking thirty year olds trying to bag a husband sticking out of her jeans, he tells their mom, but what the hell else is he going to do? Until now, Mason Freeland has coasted. Not a straight A student. Not the top athlete. Not even the average trouble making kid. Just a nice kid, he guessed some people would say. Yeah, maybe he looks at a little too much porn, maybe he smokes a little too much pot, but mostly, a normal kid. Nothing much. Tracey had always been the little kid in the family, the little sister, the one to protect. And she'd just been there, and he hadn't really paid much attention to that. But now, faced with this stranger in a crop top, nails streaked black, stud glittering in between her lips, he thinks he'd take the pigtailed kid who wrote poems any day. Thinking about it, he always kind of assumed Tracey would do something. Doesn't know how, just assumed it. She was a straight A kid, she wrote all the time. He kind of assumed she'd do something, be an author or something. Go to college. All the stuff his mom got on his case about. Because up until recently, he was the biggest worry to her, his grades, a straight-C average that could get picked up, a too-short attention span, not enough interest in homework. But now, he's been shunted aside and Tracey's taken the spot of Problem Kid. But to be honest, Mason'd rather still be in that spot. He'd take the nagging and the yelling from his mom and the concerned looks of his teachers if it meant Tracey would go back to whining at them to read something she'd written or trying to hang around his friends, and putting her hair in pigtails. Just if she'd stop sneaking out and getting high would be a start, for Christ's sake. And Mason knows that Mom's freaked to all hell. Christ, she's been thinking about calling their dad. Their fucking dad. The same one who's too busy to take them every appointed weekend. It's serious, now. And he shrugs and says it's just a phase and his sister'll be fine, of course she'll be fine, it's his sister, it's not possible that she won't be fine. But there's nothing else he can say. Sometimes, when Mason's down at the beach with his surf board, or sitting at his computer or just slumped with his friends in front of the TV, he finds himself thinking of Tracey. When he's watching her stand and scream in the kitchen, or smash her way through a door, or twine her arms around some scumbag's neck, all he wants to do is march over. He wants to drag her away, scream in her face. Wants to tell her to shut up, sit down, stop drinking, stop smoking, stop it, just stop all of it. He wants to. But he never does. Because why would she listen to him? It's not like he's their dad. It's not like he's squeaky clean. It's not like he's perfect. So why the hell would she listen? But he still wants to try. He still wants to drag her home, to pull the cigarettes out of her hands and throw them out the window, to smash every bottle she drinks from. To take a flannel and rub the stains from her face, see her skin again, her eyes looking back out at him. And wipe away the lines on her arms, the scabs etched into her skin, the scars carved into her flesh that won't vanish, no matter how long she covers her arms for. Because he knows they're there. He sees the blood on her clothes. He knows what she does. He just can't say it, because doesn't she have enough problems at the minute and who the hell wants to say that out loud, anyway? Mason can still remember his sister when she was a little girl, running after him, pigtails flying behind her head. Can still remember her eyes, blinking up at him, as she nicked fries from his plate at the dinner table. Can still remember the way she used to like him to read stories to her, tucked up in bed, the way she always giggled before Dad came in to turn off the light. He can still remember all that. And now, when he looks at her, there's leather jackets and crop tops, rings shoved through her belly button, and coke burning up her nose, cigarettes blackening her mouth. And her eyes. Those dead, dead eyes, like she's seen the world already and hates every inch of it, those eyes that stare out, that sometimes look like they're asking for something. Asking for help. Those eyes that look like someone who's already given up, who's lying back on life and letting herself be washed away, because she doesn't think she's good for anything else. Those eyes that seem to say Help me. Mason looks at her. And he wants to grab her hand and pull her out. Even if she never thanked him. Even if she never looked at him again. Even if she never spoke another word to him. He wants to. But he doesn't. Instead, he turns back to the computer screen and stares back down at the surfboard, and closes his eyes and tries to pretend that the whole thing doesn't exist. That it's just a nightmare. A nightmare, that's bad while it lasts, but that will be over soon. After all, what the hell can he do? He's only her brother.

But over nearly twelve months – eleven months, two hundred and thirty seven days to be exact, because I'm really fucking anal over little things like that – the scars have multiplied like rabbits. When Evie was here, she cared about the wounds. I think. She knew I was suffering. I think. But Evie's gone now, so I can't pretend she cares. I don't have that illusion to protect me anymore. She must be across the country by now, if not halfway around the world. She was always the more free-spirited of the two of us. If not for Evie and her magnetic influence, I wouldn't be a total basket case right now. I'd still be good girl Tracy Freeland, drug free, scar free and a decent student. But I can't blame my problems on her. No matter how far apart Evie and I are, she's still my girl. And it doesn't matter how many times she abandons me, how many times she totally fucks me over – I will always love Evie Zamora. She may never love me in return. She probably won't come home; by the time she does show up here again, I'll most likely be dead from slicing a vein. But it doesn't matter.

I walked out the door, moving in practiced, silent steps, and headed to the garage, my safe-haven. Their sounds faded as I shut the door and reached for my bong. As I went through the motions—lighting it, taking in the smoke, letting the weed burn my lungs and relax my tensed being—I thought about it all. It had been two years since Evie first brought her shit to our family. Two fucking years, and it was like she'd never left. Oh sure, things were fine for a while. Tracy stopped cutting; she even went to a teen rehabilitation center and was clean of all drugs for like six months. And as far as I can tell she still doesn't cut. Then again, she's hiked up on so many downers I don't think she could muster the energy to inflict any sort of pain on herself. She's still sneaking out at night; still giving Mom hell. She's probably turning tricks to pay for her drugs, seeing as she stopped selling. I blew out the smoke and felt myself sink into a calm stupor. I reached for the radio, and turned the damn thing as loud as it can go. They would go at it until Mom could trick herself into believing that Tracy was on her way to bed, and until they were done butting heads for the day, the garage was where I'll be; falling out from the stresses of their world that I really didn't belong in anyway.

I decided I was going to try and write a one-shot. This is a story about the movie Thirteen starring Nikki Reed and Evan Rachel Wood. If you haven't seen the movie you need to go watch it before you read this, or if you want to be confused then be my guest, go ahead and read. Tracey's POV I was standing in the check-out line with my basket when I decided I should check my list one last time. Eggs. Check. Milk. Check. Noodles. Check. Eyeliner. Crap. Uncheck. \"Excuse me I need though please.\" I told the sweet looking old lady behind me. I was a lot nicer ever since...Evie...left. I got my grades together in summer school and I am now attending a community college to become a therapist. Ironic, right? I hated Evie for the things she did to me, but I still found myself missing her since she left to Ojai . I have done a lot of things differently since she left me, of course I was devastated when she left me but I am slowly getting my life back together even after five years later. I have stopped cutting, but of course that wasn't because of Evie. My mom married Brady after they got clean, and I even started calling him dad. After my biological father decided to drop Masen and me all together I let Brady adopt me. I left my basket at the end of the make- up aisle and after I got my make-up I headed back toward my basket when I smacked straight into somebody. \"Oh my gosh. I am so sorry, I-\" \"Tracy?!?\" I was interrupted. I help the poor little boy up that I knocked down and turned around to see who oh so rudely interrupted me, only to come face to face with none other that Evie Zamora. (Ha you probably thought Evie was the one she knocked down huh?) \"Evie.\" Shit. Evie POV I hated myself for what I did to Tracy. I was jealous of everything she had. A loving mother, a caring brother, and true friends. Ruining that for her was only my intention until that day I came back from my \"date\" with KK at the park, and I saw the blood on her sleeve. I never though it would go that far. I tried to act better for her sake, but I couldn't have changed over night, but you have to believe me I really did try. I only went with Brooke to Ojai because I wasn't legally an adult, but now that I am I have come back to find Tracy, any at least try to make her believe that I am truly sorry. I pulled into the Wal-Mart to get me a frozen dinner for tonight. I walked through the automatic doors, and down to the frozen food section. On my way to the register I saw a blonde chick run into a little boy. It wasn't until I heard her voice that I realized who she was. \"Tracy?!?\" I exclaimed. \"Evie.\" She sounded disappointed. \"Why are you back here?\" Now she sounded pissed. \"I just wanted to explain why I was such a bitch all those years ago. Please\" I begged. \"Oh, so there is a reason you ruined my life five years ago, which caused me to be under constant suicide watch for over two and a half years.\" she whisper yelled. \"Why would I give you the time of day, Evie? Huh? Answer me that?\" \"Please Tracy can I buy you a coffee and discuss this?\" I pleaded. \"Fine, you have thirty minutes starting from the moment we walk into Starbucks.\" she told me. We got her basket and went to go pay for her items. I offered to pay for them but she told me I was buying her coffee so I let her get it. AT STARBUCKS \"Okay, explain.\" she told me. \"Okay Tracy you see after I left my life changed dramatically. I got my act together a little better, surprisingly I haven't dated since I left. I told Brooke the truth about everything the sex, drugs, drinking, all of it a couple years later. To say she was upset would be an understatement. See she said, and I quote, 'You made me talk to that poor girl, and her mother that way?!? Evie Zamora I have never been so disappointed and pissed with you.' She left after that she didn't come back ever since. I have heard rumors saying she got hitched, others saying she died. Honestly I could care less she never was a good guardian.\" \"I got my G-E-D in school and I am now working as a personal assistant, and I have a very good life now, but then I realized something was missing. That was you Trace I came back specifically to find you and apologize. If you don't forgive me I understand I just needed you to know that I am truly very sorry.\" I was breathless after all that I said. I sat waiting on her response. \"Evie I-\" BEEP BEEP \"Sorry that's my beeper. Shit I gotta go look I believe you and we won't be able to be friends for a VERY long time but for now we are cool. Look here is my number and I work at Hunter's Therapy call me or come by the office tomorrow and we can have lunch.\" she told me. I was surprised she gave me her number, and I am really surprised she said we were cool. \"Okay\" I murmured as I watched her walk out the door. THE NEXT DAY I got my phone out and dialed Tracy's number. What I got made me laugh because I did it to her all those years ago... The number you are trying to reach is not in service at this time. Please try your call again later. I giggled grabbed my car keys and headed down to Hunter's Therapy where she worked. HUNTER'S THERAPY \"Hello is Miss Freeland in today?\" \"Yes just go down the hall first door on your left.\" \"Thanks.\" When I got to her door I knocked lightly and stepped in. \"Hey Trace, I tried calling you, but I was going to head down here anyways. She chuckled. \"My phone didn't ring.\" We both busted out laughing. ~*~ AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO UNDERSTAND IT ESPECIALLY THE LAST PART OF THE STORY.

I must have been hallucinating, even though I hadn't taken acid or shrooms in about a year. I hadn't taken anything, or even smoked more than cigarettes. I turned around. Astrid. Medina. Even Noel or Yumi, for God's sake, disgusing their voice. I saw her, and she hadn't changed at all. Marilyn Monroe eyebrows, olive skin, long brunette hair, and those amazing chocolate brown eyes, that I remembered so fondly. Sometimes if I looked in the mirror, her eyes replaced mine. Then I blinked. Then I cried, because this glimpse of her was gone so fast. She smiled at me, her pierced tounge up against her teeth. \"Brooke couldn't keep me away from you.\" \"What happened?\" \"Brooke's in rehab. Guess those pain-pills she was taking for her Frankenstein face were good for more than shutting her the fuck up? My only living relative other than her lives here. They deemed her unfit to take care of me.\" She grinned widely. \"I love you, Tracy. You're my girl, and that will never change.\" I couldn't help it, I kissed her on the lips. She seemed shocked at first, since we hadn't kissed since...since last year. After I had to prove to her that I could kiss. Long after. Several times after. She slid her lips along mine, and moved her hands around my neck to pull herself closer to me. Our tounge rings scraped softly against eachother. What happened next was blurry. A shared joint, kisses, and giggly cries of \"Your hands are cold!\" and \"I've missed you.\" And I had missed her. But I was terrified. Because I wanted to say 'I love you'. Which I knew was unacceptable for her. Romantically? Evie did not love. I didn't think Evie loved at all. It troubled me, but this was close enough. As close as I could really get.

Considering I still have a deep abiding love of Thirteen , and I am forever seeking to improve upon my works, it's no burden at all. I watched my innocent little sister turn into Evie Zamora's clone. At first it wasn't really that bad. I mean, yeah they did everything together, but they were best friends. And that was totally okay with me, Evie Zamora was the hottest girl in school – who was I to complain if she wanted to spend all her time at my house? But then it started getting bad. Tracy would start fights with Mom for no reason. She wouldn't eat much of anything, claiming that she was on a diet. She wouldn't tell mom where she was going, or who she was going with, even though I knew it was always with Evie and her gang. I could hear them sneaking in at night, giggling to themselves about all that they had done. Tracy got her tongue pierced, just like Evie. I didn't think anything of it at first, so she got her tongue pierced, so what? I just thought she was trying to grow up too fas,t like most kids do. The first time I saw her belly ring she thought that that was what I was staring at in shock - and at first it was - but I snapped out of it when I realized that that was my baby sister leaning up against that counter looking like she was nineteen instead of thirteen. I ended up punching my friend for what he said to her. I didn't recognize her at all that night in the living room, her face twisted into a hateful expression and her eyes filled with all that anger. She wasn't my Trace anymore; she was Evie's. I was almost relieved when Mom called Dad to come take Tracy. Of course, he didn't though. He was never going to in the first place. He talked to her for all of two minutes before his phone rang. I could see the anger and sadness flash across Tracy's face when he called her a client. I tried talking to him in the driveway before he left. \"She needs help, Dad.\" But he didn't even know what was going on, when he should have known from the start. So you can imagine how happy I was when Evie left with her mom, to apparently move to Ojai. I was so relieved and happy at first. Maybe Tracy could finally go back to normal, and be my little sister again. But she didn't. It's been six weeks since Evie's been gone, and Tracy has barely said a word to anybody. She just lays around in her room, staring into space or writing in a journal. \"Evie was her only real friend for a couple months, baby. She was smoking, and drinking, and doing god-knows-what else. She just needs time to heal. She's gone through a lot. She needs us right now.\" Mom told me quietly. We were sitting at the kitchen table, the topic of conversation once again Tracy. \"I know, Mom. I know.\" I sighed, tracing patterns onto the table with my fingertip. She stood up and planted a kiss on my forehead. \"I gotta go, baby. It works-\" \"If you work it. I know. And yeah, I'll keep an eye on Tracy.\" I interrupted. She smiled and gave me a one-armed hug, planting another kiss on my forehead. \"Thanks, baby. Here's some money for supper.\" She handed me a twenty and some ones before leaving. I shoved the money into my pocket and walked into the living room, stopping in front of the door to Tracy's room. It was cracked open just enough for me to see inside. She was sitting against her headboard this time, her knees pulled up to her chest, arms wrapped around her shins. Chin resting on her knees, she was staring blankly at her wall. I slowly pushed the door open the rest of the way. Trace shifted her gaze from the wall to my face, eyes latching onto mine. She tilted her head to the side, a clear question of my presence. \"Hey Trace.\" I greeted quietly. She smiled slightly at me, and went straight back to staring at the wall. \"Hey.\" She whispered back, so quietly that I barely heard it. She moved then, switching to laying down on her side. \"Mom left some money for dinner. You want a pizza or something?\" I asked, walking across the room to stand over her. She looked up at me at the question, but it was like she was looking through me. I wasn't expecting an answer, but I got one this time. \"I'm not hungry, Mason.\" She cleared her throat before continuing. \"I know you're going to try to convince me to eat, but I can't stomach anything right now.\" She looked away then, focusing on the blanket beneath her. I took the opportunity to look at her, really look at her then. There were huge dark circles under her eyes, which were red-rimmed, probably from crying. Trace had gotten real good at crying almost completely silently. She was paler than normal, and her hair was longer than the last time I had seen it down. She didn't wear makeup anymore, and that dark nail polish Evie had loved wasn't there anymore. She was wearing the usual long sleeved shirt she always slept in, but instead of her favorite pajama pants she was wearing an old pair of black cotton shorts that were only hanging onto her skinny hips by way of a drawstring. \"I know you're not hungry, Trace. But you gotta eat. You're way too skinny.\" I pitched my voice quiet, and persuasive. She looked up at me again, her eyes fixed in a weak glare. \"I don't want to eat. I'm fine .\" I let out an exasperated sigh and yanked her shirt up, exposing her ribcage and confirming my suspicions. Her stomach was caved in slightly, and you could see every one of her ribs. \"You aren't fine, Trace! You're skin and bones and you need to eat.\" Her face twisted into that hateful expression again – only this time it wasn't as extreme as it had once been. She clawed weakly at my arms. \"Screw you, Mason! I don't want to eat!\" She screamed, trying to twist away from me. I let her struggle for a moment before letting her go. She calmed down then, and rolled over to lay on the other side of the bed, back to me. She probably thought I would go after that, just leave the room with a sigh like Mom always did. But I wasn't Mom. I crawled up onto the bed and laid down beside her. Waiting a second, I hesitantly reached out and laid a hand on her shoulder. She made a small noise in the back of her throat, and leaned into the touch. It wasn't hard to see that she just needed someone to be there. \"Trace...\" I murmured, reaching out with the other hand, and pulling her back into me. She let out a sob and turned into my embrace, throwing her arms around my neck. \"It hurts so bad, Mase...\" She breathed out against my skin. I could feel her tears dripping onto my collarbone. \"She was my best friend. She said she loved me. I loved her , and she left me .\" I didn't say anything, just tightened my arms around her and let her cry. I'm not sure how long it was, fifteen minutes or an hour, but eventually she stopped crying. \"I'm sorry, Mason.\" She whispered quietly once her breathing was back to normal, lifting her head to plant a soft kiss on my cheek. \"It's okay, Trace. I love you, you're my baby sister. I'm just as worried about you as Mom is.\" I whispered back, just as quietly. \"Love you too.\" She murmured, resting her forehead back against my collarbone. A minute later she was fast asleep. I rolled over carefully, so that she was lying on top of me, then sat up and placed my feet on the floor. Adjusting my hold on her, I stood up and carried her out into the living room, setting her down gently on the couch. Walking into the kitchen, I grabbed the phone off the counter and ordered a large pepperoni pizza. I turned around to walk back into the living room, only to see Tracy leaning against the doorway staring out the window. She pushed off it and walked unsteadily over to me, stopping when we were toe-to-toe, staring at my shirt. Then she looked up at me with wide eyes. \"I'm hungry.\" She wasn't whispering for once, or yelling at me. Her voice was hoarse from disuse. I don't really know what I expected her to say, but that wasn't it. I laughed in relief and gave her a hug. \"Oh, Trace... I just ordered the pizza, it should be here soon.\" She nodded and clutched at the back of my shirt. \"Will you put a movie in?\" She mumbled after a moment. \"Yeah. Come on.\" I let her go and walked back out into the living room. She followed, keeping a grip on the hem of my shirt. We ended up watching an old action movie that Dad left behind. When the pizza came Tracy ate two and a half pieces, sitting in the chair across the coffee table from the couch. When she was done she set her plate down on the floor before shuffling over to curl up beside me on the couch. \"Thanks, Mason. You're a good brother.\" She mumbled against my side after a minute, wrapping her arms around my waist. I slung an arm around her shoulders. \"You're my little sister, Trace, it's my job.\" She fell asleep that way, but this time she didn't wake up five minutes later. The phone rang from its spot on the coffee table. I froze for a second, but Tracy only muttered something in her sleep and turned over, releasing my waist and facing the back of the couch. I sat forward carefully and answered the phone. \"Hello?\" I kept my voice down so I didn't wake Tracy up. \"Hey baby!\" Mom's voice sounded loudly over the phone. There was loud music playing in the background. \"Mom, where are you?\" I questioned as I stood up, walking into the kitchen. \"Oh baby, it was Jill's fifteenth year sober! Some of the ladies decided to throw her a party and I couldn't just say no!\" There was some rustling in the background before the music became muffled. \"How's Tracy?\" She asked in a quieter voice. \"She's actually pretty good, Mom. I ordered a pizza and she ate more than half a piece.\"I informed her quietly, glancing back into the living room to make sure Tracy was okay. This was the first time in awhile she's been asleep and hasn't woken up screaming from some nightmare. \"That's good baby, that's really good.\" I could hear the smile in her voice. \"I know.\" I held my breath momentarily when Trace stirred in her sleep again, but she was only rolling back over. I let my breath out in a rush of air, waiting for Mom to reply. It sounded like she was talking to someone else. \"Why do you keep talking so quietly, baby? I can barely hear you.\" She asked me after a minute of laughing with the other person. \"Trace is asleep on the couch. I don't wanna wake her up. Just come home whenever. Trace is fine with me. I gotta go. Bye.\" I hung up. Leaving the phone on the counter, I walked back out into the living room. Glancing up at the clock, it read 11:12. Making sure Trace was still out of it, I walked into her room and pulled the covers down enough for her to slide in easily. Going back into the living room I scooped her up carefully, pointedly ignoring how light she was. I carried her back into her room and laid her on the bed, pulling the blankets up to cover her. \"Goodnight, Trace.\" I whispered in her ear, kissing her temple. I walked back into my own room, slipping out of my clothes and pulling on a pair of old basketball shorts to sleep in, before crashing onto my bed. XxxXxxXxxXxxX I hadn't been asleep for very long when I heard the door to my room creak open. I propped myself up on an elbow and squinted trying to see who was standing in the doorway. \"Mom? Is that you?\" I asked around a yawn. It wasn't. Tracy stepped into the little pool of moonlight by my window. She must have woken up awhile ago because she had changed out of her long sleeved shirt into one of the small black tank tops she and Evie used to share. \"Mason?\" She asked quietly. \"Mm, what is it Trace?\" It looked like she'd been crying again, and she was nervously fiddling with the hem of the tank top. \"Can I sleep with you? I had a bad dream...\" She trailed off, looking down at her feet sheepishly. I grinned sleepily at her and patted the bed beside me. She smiled slightly and crawled over me to lay in between me and the wall. \"Thanks.\" She whispered quietly, throwing an arm over my stomach in a one-armed hug. Her skin felt like ice to my overheated body. I twisted so that I was facing her, and wrapped her up in a hug. \"God Trace, you're cold.\" I muttered against her hair. She seemed to agree because she pulled herself tighter to me, pressing her face into my chest. I let out a hiss of surprise, her lips felt like ice. Reaching behind me with one arm, I pulled my discarded comforter over us. \"How did you get so cold anyway, Trace?\" I asked her after a moment, rubbing my hands up and down her arms to warm her up. \"Mom brought the fan in my room when she got home. She thought I needed it because I wasn't using my blankets, so I was obviously hot.\" She murmured without lifting her face from my chest. I didn't blame her though, she was half asleep already, and freezing. She shivered again and pressed one of her legs against mine. \"Holy shit.\" I exclaimed at the sudden press of frigid skin. \"How long did you lay in front of the fan before coming in here?\" She mumbled something along the lines of 'Dunno. Don' care.' \"Why didn't you go in to lay with Mom? You know that would have made her real happy.\" I wondered out loud. Tracy sighed. \"Didn't wanna lay with Mom. I wanted to lay with my big brother. Now will he shut up so that I can do that in peace?\" By the end of her little speech she had lifted her head to glare at me. And for a second she was the old Tracy again, the pre-Evie Tracy. I grinned down at her. \"Goodnight Trace.\" \"Goodnight Mason.\" XxxXxxXxxXxxX I woke up to my door creaking open again. For a moment I thought it might be Tracy sneaking out before I woke up, but it wasn't. I could feel her now-warm weight pressed against my side. Mom was standing in my doorway, just staring at Trace and I. \"Mom?\" I questioned softly. Her eyes snapped up to my face. \"Tracy wasn't in her bed. I thought maybe she finally decided to run away and find Evie.\" She explained, keeping her voice low. \"No, she just came in here because she was cold and had a nightmare.\" I reassured, matching her low tone of voice. For a second hurt flashed through her eyes, before they leveled back out into a neutral expression. She smiled at me. \"Well, I made oatmeal for breakfast. Come and get some when you're ready.\" Then she turned and left, closing my door behind her. I laid there for a minute, before getting up. I carefully unlocked Tracy's hands from behind my back and untangled our legs, trying not to wake her up. This was the first time she had slept peacefully since Evie, as far as I knew. I changed into a pair of jeans and a shirt lying in the clean pile of clothes on my floor before leaving my room in favor of the kitchen. \"Morning Mom.\" I mumbled, plopping down in the chair across from her. \"Good morning, baby.\" She greeted handing me a bowl full of oatmeal. I mumbled a thanks and dug in. I had just started on my second bowl when Tracy came in. That was a thing in and of itself too, because Trace hadn't eaten a meal with us since Evie. She was wearing those jeans Mom had put fake leopard fur on for her, and one of my long sleeved shirts. They were big on me, so she practically swam in it. It almost looked comical, tiny jeans covering tiny legs only to be engulfed by a huge shirt. \"Morning, Mase.\" She murmured quietly, sitting on the edge of her chair, back to the window. \"Mom.\" She greeted with a nod of her head. Mom looked like she'd just found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \"Good morning, baby!\" She stood up and walked around the table to give Trace a hug, happy enough by her presence actually at the table with us to ignore it when Trace flinched slightly and shifted away from her. \"There isn't any oatmeal left, but do you want me to make you something else?\" Mom told her gently, almost like she was afraid of the reaction she was going to receive. I guess that made sense though; Trace had gone from full speed ahead demon child in the making, to actual real life zombie in about a day flat, so it wasn't that far fetched to think she could do the reverse and be that hateful girl from that night in the living room again. \"Can you get me a spoon?\" Tracy asked quietly. Mom lit up again when Trace actually spoke to her. \"Of course, baby.\" Not a second later Mom handed Tracy her spoon, and sat back down across from her. Trace leaned forward and stuck her spoon in my bowl, taking a tiny spoonful and popping it into her mouth. I grinned and shoved the bowl in between us so we could share. She ate slowly, just like she had last night. She had told me then that if she ate too fast she would throw up, and believe it or not she did not want to throw up. So we ended up taking bites at the same time, and the same size. When there was only a little bit left in the bowl I pushed it the rest of the way towards her. At her puzzled look I nodded towards the bowl. \"Finish it. I had a bowl before you came in.\" She stared at me for a second before eating the rest. I glanced over and noticed Mom looking back and forth between us uncertainly. Her eyes were sad every time they landed on Tracy. She smiled when she noticed that I was looking at her. I felt a little guilty at that. Mom had been trying to get Trace to respond to her like this for six weeks with no results, and I watch Tracy for one night and she's a little better. But I shook the feeling off, I didn't need to feel guilty. Tracy didn't want Mom's help. I guess Mom's help was just a little too late in Tracy's eyes, since Mom watched the whole thing happen and didn't really do anything about it. Well, I didn't really do anything, either. But at time it seemed like Mom was encouraging it, letting Evie live with us, not punishing Trace when she did something wrong. I snapped out of my thoughts and stood up. \"I'm gonna take Hampton on a walk.\" I announced, grabbing the leash off the top of the fridge. Fresh air and a little exercise would be good for clearing my head. Hampton was in the backyard, lying on his side in the shade beneath our tree. I shook him awake and attached the leash to his collar, smiling when his tail started wagging a hundred miles an hour at the implication of a walk. I was almost out of the driveway when Tracy caught up to me. She was wearing sunglasses, her head bowed a little; away from the sun. She peered at me over the tops of her sunglasses. \"Can I come with?\" I smiled and held out my hand for her to take. \"Of course, Trace.\" This little oneshot has been rattling around in my brain for awhile so I thought I'd type it out and publish it for you to read. Thirteen is one of my favorite movies, I have no idea why. It just is I suppose… Okay, done. I tried to keep it as close to the original as possible while still fixing errors and adding and subtracting tiny parts. Enjoy!

No more pills, no more coke, no more drinking, no more random sex, no more pot. Cigarettes are another matter. The one addiction she is allowed. The one socially acceptable addiction and she will use it, to make it go away. To look at her fingers holding the smoke and remember black nail polish and tongue rings. Remember awkward first times and not remembering yesterday and stinging on the insides of her wrists, cuts chafing against rough, rough material of her sleeve. She remembers forgetting. Remembers numbness. So numb it hurt; so numb she couldn't hear, couldn't feel, made it all better. No more caring. No more being let down. No more vulnerable good girl, no more. Bad girl. Like it – wanted it. Fuck me, touch me, smoke me, breathe me, can't hurt me. Not a baby anymore Trace. So she sits on a bus, disapproving glances on all sides, tuts and shakings of the head at her refusal to put out her cigarette. Stupid that they don't know how many memories this one little stick brings up. Stupid how they think she likes it. Stupid how many she's smoked in her life. Stupid how ten years ago she was older than she is right now. Stupid that nobody knows, stupid, it's all so stupid. She is a real person now, with real goals and real dreams and real achievements – she has done what they said she would never do. She has got back on the rails. She is a good girl once more. The scars have faded, the tongue ring came out when she turned sixteen, the belly when she was seventeen. She is twenty three. No more smoke and mirrors. Her cigarette goes out and she stabs it fiercely against the seat. Stupid how many times she's done that. On her way back to L.A for god knows why – her mother left long ago, got a job in a hip little hairdressing place in Maine. She has no more memories of a thirteen year old loosing control. Maine is so safe, Trace. It'll all be better, I'll make it better baby. Take you away. Her brother stuck around for a few months, but he's settled down in Miami now – to be by the waves, surfing. He's got a little girl and a wife, one on the way, no more memories of half-passed-out sisters and crop tops downtown. Her father – well fuck knows where that sonofabitch is, cleared off when things came to a head. She doubts he has any memories at all. She has memories. They leave her alone for days; weeks at a time. And then it comes up, smell of pot, a flash of metal from a teenage mouth. A fifteen year old passed out in a doorway – her new friends, her better friends pull her by the sleeve saying \"oh Trace, don't talk to her – she's such a skank! Seriously, have you seen her? I mean, she's always drunk and stoned and fucking about and have you seen the state of her arms...?\" and she wants to take that little girl into her arms and hold her and say it's okay, it's okay you deserve to be better - you can be better baby. But that girl would shake her off in a drug haze, beat her ass for touching her. I don't need anybody , is what she'll say. So Tracey will leave her, she will talk away with a stabbing in her brain, blood on the bathroom floor all coming up again. But here she is; getting off the clammy bus into clammier heat – Melrose. This is sick Tracey, this is so sick coming back here, just to – just to what? Just to hurt herself. Just to see if that allure is still there – if the temptation of a teenage wasteland can bring her to her dirty knees. She stays in L.A for two days and leaves. The heat gets to her. That's what she tells everyone anyway. She has finished high school, she has been to college – she has a steady boyfriend, good friends and she earns good money writing song lyrics for singers in the charts. She has a nice house – she goes out at the weekends, drinks responsibly and wears short sleeves. She cooks healthy meals, she visits the beach with her boy, she makes love. But when she puts the cigarettes to her lips, she sees a playground in L.A and she watches it crumble.

She couldn't say it was evernforgotten, because as much as she sometimes wanted to, she couldnnever forget that part of her life. Thirteen years old, lookingnnineteen, living the high life between seventh grade classes andnlying to her mom. Out with the old,nin with the new. Tearing, ripping, tossing jeans out the window. nChange, change, be like her, be like them. Even with a decade innaging added, she hardly looked any different. She dressedndifferently, to be certain—more subdued, quieter, lessnprovocative—but her dark hair, still hanging to the middle of hernback and framing her face, sharp hazel eyes, the strikingly beautifulnface and somehow always athletic frame. At the sight of her,nbrowsing through the music racks distractedly, Tracey felt her breathnhitch in her throat, automatically ducking her head and letting hernblonde locks fall to cover her face from view. Evie. The girl thatnhad changed her life at the tender age of thirteen. Memories flashednbefore Tracey's eyes, tongue piercings, tag teaming surfer boys,nsmoking pot. Cigarette smoke andnBrooke's beers, stolen clothes, the sweet stench of marijuananfloating around the room. Dancing and screaming under parknsprinklers, teenage boys and teenage hormones, blood on the wrist andnblood on the sleeve, falling falling faster faster, don't look downntill you hit the ground. Tracey wasntorn, peering through strands of layered blonde hair at the woman shenbarely knew anymore. Half of her was screaming to run over andnembrace her, feel Evie's arms around her again, holding her up andnkissing her forehead. The other half was keeping her feet firmlynplanted in the same spot, telling her to let the past stay in thenpast. Absently she let hernhands flip through the CDs in front of her, eyes staring at thenartists but never seeing them. Evie. Evie, Evie, Evie, right therenin front of her. You don't knownhow to kiss, I didn't even feel that, taste of beer and tobacco onnher lips. Laughter and the freedom to not care. Tracey didn'tnknow how long she had been standing there, one hand hanging limply atnher side, the other resting on the stack of CDs directly in front ofnher. She peeked over the racks again, doing a double take to realizenshe'd missed any chance she had, Evie had left. \"Excuse me,\"nSomeone mumbled distractedly, squeezing past her in the narrownaisles. \"Evie,\" Traceynwhispered stupidly, one hand flying up to clap over her mouth,nwishing she could bring the word back into her mouth. Evie's headnsnapped up, looking her in the face, eyes going wide and unblinking. \"Oh my God,\" shenbreathed, jumping back a step away from Tracey. \"Oh my God! nTracey?\" She brushed her hair out of her face automatically,nstaring at the blonde woman. \"H…hey,\" Traceynsaid weakly, trying to smile. \"Been a while.\" It was anstatement, not a question. \"Oh my God,\" Eviensaid for a third time, reaching out hesitantly like she wanted tontouch Tracey, but drawing her hand back fearfully. \"How long hasnit been?\" she asked softly. \"Almost ten years,\"nTracey said back, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

Tracey felt a genuinenalmost-smile on her lips, looking up and into her eyes for the firstntime. \"Yeah, I think we can do that.\" Evie smiled, one ofnthose soft smiles she never showed around anyone else in public, thatnTracey had always childishly thought were reserved for her only, andnnodded once, leading her out of the record store. They sat in a desertedncoffee shop. Mid morning on a Sunday, everyone was either asleep ornat church. Tracey wondered absently why it was she couldn't sleepnthat morning. \"What happened tonus, Tracey?\" Evie asked, breaking the silence. She had her handsnwrapped around the Styrofoam coffee cup, holding it tightly, her feetndrawn up into the booth in front of her, knees under her chin. Tracey stared downninto her drink, watching a thin tendril of steam rise, unsure of hownto answer. For the longest time, she'd wanted to blame Evie forneverything gone wrong in her life. Failing the seventh grade, havingnto switch schools, struggling to get into college, the years ofntherapy and in and out of rehab. She'd spent years telling herselfnthat Evie had caused it all. \"I think,\" shensaid carefully. \"I think we were both too self destructive on ournown, and after we came together, we just egged one another on untilnwe were so far gone we couldn't come back.\" \"No,\" Evie saidnforcefully, shocking Tracey into looking up. \"Tracey, no. It wasnmy fault. I know that now. You were good kid before you startednhanging out with me.\" Tracey felt a bitternlaugh escape her lips. \"Evie, you didn't bring out anything thatnwasn't already there. I was already coming to pieces inside, Injust didn't know it.\" \"No,\" Evie saidnagain. \"No, no, that's not it! I pulled you into everything, Intried to manipulate you, I betrayed you-\" \"Evie!\" Traceyninterrupted. \"Evie, we were thirteen. We were young and stupidnand we wanted to be everything we weren't. Everyone makesnmistakes, Evie, especially when they're young. We tried to take onnthe world, and the world came back to bite us in the ass.

Evie wants to shopnwith me, do a little dance, phone is disconnected, trash on the floornand yelling brothers. \"Tracey,\" Eviensaid weakly, tears in her eyes. Tracey felt sick, remembering thenonly time she ever saw Evie cry, pressing herself against the fencenbehind her house, using it to stay standing, sobbing into it. Traceynleaving her to cry, running away, unable to handle it. \"You'rensupposed to hate me.\" \"I did,\" shenresponded quietly. \"I wanted to, I tried my hardest to, and Inprobably did for a little while. I wanted to blame you forneverything. I wanted it to be someone else's fault besides mine,nand you were the most obvious target. But like I said, you didn'tnbring out anything that wasn't already there. The person I wasnaround you… God, I never felt more comfortable in my skin than whennit was just you and me.\" Trace took a deepnbreath, feeling what she wanted to say bubbling in her throat withnnerves. \"Evie,\" she began again, looking down and refusing tonlook at the other woman. \"I need to tell you something, that I'venwanted to say for ten years. I need to tell you that… that… I'mnsorry,\" she finished weakly, taking a deep breath. \"The day Momnand I took you back to Brooke's, I never should have left younthere. I let you down, and I wasn't a friend to you, and I nevernshould've done that, and I'm sorry.\" The silence across thentable finally got her to look up, holding her breath, to meet Evie'snhazel eyes, wide and unblinking. \"Tracey,\" shenbreathed. \"God, you don't need to apologize!\" \"Yes, I do,\"nTracey said hurriedly. \"I knew about your past, and I knew younwere never happy living there, and I left you there.\" Evie flinched visiblynat Tracey's words about her past, causing a new wave of guilt tonwash over the blonde. \"Shit,\" she muttered. \"Sorry, Inshouldn't have mentioned that.\" \"No,\" Evie saidncarefully. \"It's okay. I'm… almost okay with it by now.\" \"Almost?\" \"Almost. I… tendnto attract abusive people,\" Evie said softly, taking her turn tonlook down at the table. \"First it was my uncle. Then Brooke'snboyfriends. Then…\" Her voice trailed off. Tracey, unaware andnunthinking about it, automatically switched her seat over to next tonher old friend, one arm around her shoulders. She could feel anslight tremble in the shorter woman's shoulders. \"Then…\" shensaid, her voice tight. \"Then it was my fiancé. My fiancé .\"n She laughed bitterly. Tracey took a deepnbreath, then another, and another, at a loss for words. How muchncould one girl face in 23 short years? \"I'm so sorry,\"nshe whispered into Evie's dark hair, tightening her arm around hernshoulders. She felt Evie shaking almost uncontrollably, crying ontonTracey's shoulder. Tracey marveled at how much they had bothnchanged from who they used to be. Evie was no longer the flamboyant,nenthusiastic, sly girl she had been, shaking her hips at all thenright times to get what she wanted, dancing around and teasing everynmale in sight. And Tracey herself was little of the destructive,ndepressed teenager she used to be. She was about to graduatencollege, a psychology major. She had friends, had somehow salvagednher relationship with Noel, she had a life away from everything shenhad once been. Yet here she was,nstill finding herself emotionally attached to Evie, wantingndesperately for the other woman to stay in her life this time. Break, break, he'sna cokehead, brother called you a slut, don't talk to me, I hate younMom. Evie, Evie, everywhere, I love you, you're my girl, aren'tnyou going to adopt me, Mel? Tracey didn't knownhow long it had been before they started talking again. They spokenof mundane things, catching up. Tracey told her about college andnher upcoming graduation, how she was going to try and get herndoctorate someday. Evie spoke of dropping out of high school, butngetting her GED at fifteen, working three jobs at a time, losingnBrooke to suicide at eighteen, community college and how shenapparently had a hand for business, running three clothing storesnnow. The man she thought she'd fallen in love with, was engagednto, was pregnant with his child, until he beat her so hard she lostnthe baby and three weeks of memory. \"How's your mom?\"nEvie asked suddenly, during a lull in the conversation. Traceynsmiled. \"Good,\" she said. n\"She's doing good. She went to night school, got her GED and anbusiness degree. She owns a salon now, she's bringing in morenmoney now, and she doesn't have to support me or Mason anymore, sonshe's living pretty good now.\" \"That's great,\"nEvie said, a faraway look in her eyes. \"I miss Brooke. nAfter…everything with us, she was so good to me. She startedncaring, it seemed. For five years, I had a mom,\" she said quietly. Tracey stroked hernhair, wiping a tear from her cheek. \"I'm so sorry,\" she saidninto Evie's dark hair, for what felt like the twentieth time thatnday. They were still curled up on the same side of the booth,nleaning against one another like they had so many years ago. \"Me too,\" Evienwhispered. She stared at her empty coffee cup, one tear running downnher cheek. Neither said anything for the longest time. \"Your brothernthought we were sleeping together, did you know that?\" Evie askednquite suddenly, her familiar smirk in place. Tracey sat boltnupright, staring at the woman next to her. \" What ?\" shenpractically shrieked. \"He said what ?\" Evie laughed, thatnfull bodied, infectious laugh Tracey had missed for ten years. \"Hendid,\" she confirmed. \"Cornered me one night when I came out ofnyour room and asked if I was sleeping with his sister.\" \"Oh my God,\"nTracey said. \"No he didn't . He did ?\" Evie nodded, giggling.n \"Yep. \"Oh my God,\"nTracey moaned, burying her head in her hands. \"Well, we werenpretty close,\" Evie said, shaking her hair out of her eyes. \"Andnwe did make out.\" \"Once!\" Traceynsaid. \"Only once! And that was hardly making out, it was onenkiss!\" She jumped up out of the booth, suddenly full of energy atnthe shocking news Evie had revealed to her. \"Ohhh, I am so goingnto murder him. He is so dead!\" Evie laughed again,nstanding up next to her. She followed Tracey out of the coffee shop,nsmiling when Tracey almost unconsciously grabbed her hand and held onntight, as she was afraid Evie would get stolen from her if shendidn't. Tracey continued to mutter about her brother, much tonEvie's amusement. Tracey stoppednsuddenly, turning to look at Evie with wide eyes, before darting intonan alleyway and dragging her with her. \"What the-\" \"Have you beenntelling people we made out?\" Tracey hissed, eyes wide. Evienblinked in confusion. \"Um, no?\" \"You promise?\" Evie giggled. \"Whatnif I did? Was kissing me really so embarrassing you didn't wantnanyone to know about it?\" Tracey stared at her,nmouth open, forgetting what she was going to say. \"Uh,\" shenspluttered. \"I…\" Evie stepped closer tonher, doing that thing where she looked up through her eyelashes,nlooking so much like she did at thirteen Tracey found herselfnshaking. \"I wasn't that badnof a kisser, was I?\" Evie asked quietly, eyebrows raised inncuriosity. \"I… don'tnremember,\" Tracey said, at a loss, unable to move.

So , yeah... enjoy. DISCLAIMER: I don't own these characters. Bunnymund sniffed the ground, following the scent he'd been on for hours. He was getting close, he could feel it. North had sent him and Tooth out to look for Jack while he and Sandy stayed behind to strategize on what to do about Pitch. Personally, Bunnymund thought that Jack had just up and left after their first fight with Pitch. It'd be very typical of the boy, but North refused to believe it. Now Bunnymund was following Jack's scent that was getting colder, literally. Like Jack the scent smelled of just-fallen snow, pond water, and magic from that staff he always carried around. Bunnymund approached a large empty house where the trail led. He crept around it, looking for a less than obvious way in. The scent was definitely stronger in here, and the fact that the temperature since he'd been near the house hinted that a certain annoying, immature winter spirit was indeed inside the large, spooky house. Bunnymund jumped onto the roof and slid inside an unlocked window. He stepped into the attic, might as well start searching from the top. His ears twitched, he could hear something out of place here. He ran through the empty, dark house to the basement and pressed his long ear to the door. Yes, there it was! A low murmuring accompanied by the unmistakable sound of someone crying. Bunnymund cautiously opened the door and was met with a gust of freezing cold wind. Yep, the boy was down here. Relieved that his search was over, Bunnymund tromped down the stairs and looked around. Bits of snow swirled around at blizzard speed, forming a cyclone around the huddled corner in the far corner. The white hair and bar feet gave it away that it was Jack, but he was acting weird, even for him. \"Oi, mate, get up! We need to get out of here.\" Bunnymund tried to approach the boy, but a dark force pushed him back. \"I'm sorry,\" a dark, sinister voice said, \"but Jack is not going anywhere.\" Bunnymund watched in fright as Pitch himself stepped out of the shadows. A twisted smile spread on his face. \"The boy is mine now.\"[Chapter 2] Jack didn't mean to be kidnapped, it just sort of happened. After the fight with Pitch he just needed some time to think. To be honest, Pitch and his dark sand scared him. He'd never admit this to the other guardians, his tough guy, couldn't care-less bravado would go right out the window and be trampled by North's reindeer. Jack just needed some time alone to get his act together. Jack was an expert on alone, he wasn't used to being around others who could see and interact with him. He'd come back and help them out, honest. Jack meandered through the streets without a real destination in mind. After all, he usually went where the wind took him. But strangely, there was no wind tonight. That was what woke jack out of his pensive state. There was always wind where Jack went, he'd never seen a still day as long as he could remember. Jack looked around as he gripped his staff. He'd somehow cornered himself in a dead-end alley, facing a tall brick wall covered in graffiti with no way over. Jack turned around and saw a tall nightmare pawing the ground. Jack blasted it with a gust of frigid winter air, but the horse danced out of the way as it neighed into the dark sky. It was a signal. \"Hello Jack,\" a sinister, familiar voice said. Jack turned again as Pitch literally stepped out of a shadow on a wall. \"We need to talk.\" Pitch had sent out his nightmares all across the world with one goal, 'Find Jack Frost.' The boy had sparked his interest over the years, but now, with Pitch's plan in full swing, the boy was needed. Jack had much to offer with his particular set of gifts. All he needed was an incentive. Insanity was always a good one, and it was oh so easy to unlock. Insanity, as you know, is just like gravity, all it needs is a little push. Pitch found the boy around midnight. He stepped out of the shadows to draw the boy's attention away from the nightmare. \" Hello Jack,\" he said. \"we need to talk.\" The boy's eyes widened and he pointed his pesky staff at Pitch. As far as Pitch could tell, the staff channeled Jack's power, but the raw force of winter was in the boy himself. \"What do you want?\" the boy demanded, eyes narrowing in distrust. Pitch couldn't help but smile, \"Why Jack, I only want the same as you, I suppose. Acknowledgment, admiration, respect, a purpose.\" \"I'm nothing like you.\" \"you misunderstand me. I just want to be recognized by the people of the world. To be believed in.\" The boy lowered his staff, he knew the feeling well. Then he pointed it again at Pitch, \"You want to rule the world through fear, I'll never help you.\" the staff started to glow a chilly blue, but Pitch beat him to the punch. The nightmare crept up behind the boy and reared. Its hooves lashed out and struck him in the head. His eyes rolled into his head and he fell to the ground. Pitch leaned over and took the staff, which was no longer laced with ice. \"Never say never, boy.\" Pitch nodded to the nightmare which swirled around the two still figures. A moment later there was a flash and the sand settled. Pitch and Jack were gone.[Chapter 3] Bunnymund kept his eyes on Pitch as he reached for his eggsploders. \"What did you do to Jack?\" \"I would say I have expanded his mind.\" Pitch chuckled. Bunnymund looked over to the boy. He looked terrible, he was hunched in on himself, gripping his head like it was going to fall off. His eyes were screwed tightly shut, trying to block out whatever Pitch was showing him. The boy's staff was nowhere to be seen, which was odd, since he always had it by his side. Bunnymund glared at Pitch, \"What do you want with him?\" Pitch spread his hands, \"I only want a helper.\" \"A helper?\" Bunnymund repeated incredulously. Pitch stood straighter as if to justify himself. \"You have your eggs, the Fairy has her birds, the old man has his elves and beasts, and the Sandman has his sand. I have no one.\" \"You have your nightmares.\" Bunnymund pointed out. Pitch snorted, \"they are servants. They cannot think or be of any real use. Jack too is alone, in case you haven't noticed, he could also use alliances.\" Bunnymund was about to say that Pitch and Jack were nothing alike, but upon further thought, he stopped himself. They were both powerful, no denying that. They both had tragic origin stories. Neither could be seen by children, but both could make their presence felt. And the Guardians were wary of both. Bunnymund kept a hand on his eggs. \"Why him? Why not manipulate someone else?\" Pitch glared at him, \"are you volunteering? You don't seem to understand. You have nothing to offer me. What, the fear of bunnies? No, the boy could give me the fear of cold, the fear of being invisible, the fear of being alone, the fear of drowning.\" Over in the corner, dark sand seeped out of the floor and formed a spiral around Jack, closing in on him. The boy began to scream. Bunnymund tried to run to him, but the dark substance pushed him back. \"CUT IT OUT!\" he yelled, but Pitch only smiled. Jack subconsciously tried to protect himself against Pitch's dark power. The snow thickened as it blew through the room and the floor was slick with ice. Bunnymund shivered, the temperature was dropping rapidly, a far cry from his favorite Australian climate. The shadows deepened and bent as nightmares raced out and started to spin around the room, adding to the chaos. Under all the confusion, Bunnymund tried again to get to Jack. He grabbed the boys shoulder and pulled at him. \"Jack, snap out of it!\" he yelled into the boy's ear. Jack looked up, his eyes wet with tears. The moment they touched his skin, they'd freeze and fall to the ground as bits of ice. \"It's all my fault, I did it, I-I killed her. I'm sorry just I can't.\" The boy wasn't making sense at all, and Pitch started to laugh a scary maniacal laugh. \"It seems the boy is afraid of me! Go on rabbit, run!\" Bunnymund realized that if he stayed he'd freeze to death. Pitch didn't have a body to keep warm so he wasn't affected. If Bunnymund didn't leave now, he'd die, plain and simple. But Jack was obviously not moving, and the little widow in the corner was getting harder and harder to get too. Bunnymund cursed under his breath then made a decision. He looked Jack in the eyes, \"We'll come back for you, don't give in.\" Jack showed no evidence of understanding, but it'll have to do for now. Bunnymund hopped to the window, threw an eggsploder at it and leapt out. He ran. ","Summary":" I have not seen this movie (duh, it's not out yet) i just thought this'd be a cool story.

She crossed her arms. How dare she make her go through this shit? Like what had happened wasn't enough? She closed her eyes. \"I'm not going,\" she said firmly. \"What?\" Her mother turned around. She was trying to light the cigarette which was pinned between her thin lips. Ugh, Tracy thought. Her mother wouldn't let her have one, but there she was… smoking right in front of her. How fucking hypocritical? \"Yes, you are, Trace. You need to,\" she lit it up and took a long needed puff. \"After all the shit you've been through, after everything you've done to yourself, don't you want to talk to someone? I mean, God knows you won't tell me about any of--\" Tracy growled. She had to bring it up, didn't she? Her eyes narrowed. If only looks could kill, Tracy thought to herself. Hmm, that might be nice. She hadn't cut in three weeks, hadn't that been enough? \"I'm not going to that fucking shrink and let that bitch tell me what the hell is wrong with me!\" She turned away from her. \"I already know what's wrong with me,\" she murmured to herself. Her mom shook her head, closing her eyes to fight back the tears. It had been so tense around here the last couple of weeks. She didn't know what to do. She had called Trace's dad, trying to get him over here, but he didn't want to deal with it. No body did, not even Trace. Oh, especially her. She sat down. \"…Yeah, Trace, and what's that?\" She asked, looking back to her. Trace looked to her. How dare she? Who the FUCK did she think she was? She stood angrily, her fists down beside her, as tight as she could get them. \"You,\" she said coldly. Her mom looked up. Shock and immediate pain jabbed at her. \"H-how could you say something like that Tracy? I never did anything to you, I--\" Tracy laughed angrily. \"Who the hell do you think you're foolin', Mom? Not me!\" She slapped her chest. \"Even before I met Evie, I was smoking… and who do you think I got the notion from, huh? Who do you think I got the fucking cigarettes from? YOU!\" She screamed. She could see the pain in her mother's eyes, and God, did she want more. \"If you weren't off banging that goddamn bum you call a boyfriend, maybe you would have noticed the shit that was happening with me! Maybe you wouldn't have seen what was happening before it got to this point. But did you? No, Mom.. You didn't… and you want to know why?\" She took steps forward. Her mother shook her head. \"Trace,\" her eyes welled up with tears. How could she say such hateful things to her? \"Stop. You don't mean those things.\"Tracy laughed again. \"…Oh, mom, believe me. I mean them. I mean EVERY single fucking word of it, because it is the truth. The TRUTH will set you free, Mom!\" She grabbed her and shook her. \"You want to know why you didn't notice shit about me?\" Her mother shook her head again, a tear cascading down her paled face. \"Because, mom… You're a pathetic waste of a parent. You're nothing!\" She pushed her away as she walked passed her. She didn't regret what she had said, she didn't feel remorse for what she had said, because she felt it was true. She blamed her mother in all of this, perhaps not as much as Evie, but that was a completely different thing. She slammed her bedroom door and fell into her mess of a bed. Her mind was still racing with anger and hate that she hadn't even noticed how silent it was outside her bedroom door. She couldn't even hear her mother crying. Damn it, she thought to herself. She reached behind her dresser drawer and pulled out a liter and a single cigarette. She had a secret stash of cigarettes, since that's the only thing she could really get at school. She had tried to get weed, to get coke, anything she could… but all of the kids there were fucking pansies. Hadn't tried anything new, or good… Bastards, she thought to herself as she laid back. She lit the cigarette and sucked in the tar, the nicotine, and all the pretty colors of toxins with a single soothing breath. Mmm, she blew the smoke out, closing her eyes. So her mom wanted her to go to a shrink? Ugh, she couldn't even believe she was thinking about it again. She didn't want to tell some short little fat man with a comb-over her adolescent problems. She had a hard enough time telling her mother the stupid little random things, which most of the time, weren't true. She looked up to the ceiling above her bed. It was just a plain ol' white, nothing special, nothing interesting. That's what she felt about herself most of the time. Nothing special… Yeah, nothing. She needed more cigarettes and she definitely needed a drink but her mom hadn't even let rubbing alcohol or even Nyquil into the house since Evie left that day. So many things had changed, and she HATED it. She wanted things back to the way the were before… Before all of this stupid bullshit happened. Before… when she was normal. She puffed on the cigarette again, looking blankly up at the ceiling. Maybe she did need help? Maybe her mom was right? She rubbed the cigarette out on the dresser and dropped the butt to the floor. Whatever, she thought to herself as she kicked off her sneakers and pulled the sheets up over her head. She needed some sleep… and she needed some time to think.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 - Session 1: \"Cold, Hard Bitch\" The world was passing her by… the cars, the hundreds of shitty houses on the residential streets, the kids playing… It seemed surreal. She wasn't a part of that world anymore, she thought to herself. She was… on the outside looking in. Tracy sighed and looked over to her mom. She was driving towards the Doctor's office. \"Do I really have to do this?\" Her mom looked over to her. She'd been really quiet since they fought last. It was sort of weird, and nice, to have the quiet; though she wasn't sure if leaving her with her thoughts in her own head was such a good thing. \"Yeah,\" her mom interrupted her thought. \"You have to do this. You have no other choice, Trace.\" Yeah, she did, she thought to herself. She could sit up and step right out of this car and walk back home. She didn't have to do this, she didn't have to do shit. Then why was she going, again? Shut up, she argued with herself. Tracy turned her head to look out the window. It was a sunny, warm day. Yeah, what a great day to go see a nut doctor. She closed her eyes. How long would it be before they got there? Long enough for a nap? She hadn't really slept last--.\"Trace,\" her mom called, turning the key to the ignition. The car flattened a little bit, settling into it's comfy, little parking space. \"We're here.\" She opened her eyes and sat up, looking over to the building. There weren't many cars here. Ha, she laughed to herself. She thought there'd be a lot more crazy people there. It was sort of funny that she was one of them, now. Would she need a club membership? Ha! \"Come on,\" her mom said, opening the door and stepping out of the car. \"Get out, Trace. We're going to be late if you--\"\"Shut up,\" Tracy barked at her, opening the door to get out. \"Don't fucking bitch so much.\" She slammed the car door as she started walking towards the building. They walked in and Tracy sat down as her mother went to the receptionists desk. It smelled funny in here. Maybe someone hadn't taken a shower? She looked around to the couple people sitting in the less than comfortable chairs. Eghck, she thought to herself. Do I look like that? She noticed the table; there were tons of magazine's on it, newspapers, television guides. She picked up one of the magazines - 'Psychology Today.' Oh yeah, she thought to herself. A magazine made by crazy people, FOR crazy people! This is why you're crazy, this is how to fix it. Yeah, whatever, she tossed it back to the table. There were some weird paintings on the wall too. Didn't even look like anything, just… lines and splotches of paint. Sort of looked like a bad acid trip… Heh, acid, she thought. Her mom wandered over and sat next to her with a long sigh. She didn't say one word to her. Was she going to go back there with her? She hoped not. She didn't need two people bitching at her, telling her what she's done wrong in this 'out-of-control' life of hers. Tracy yawned. She couldn't believe she was actually doing this. She felt no real need, but she knew if she didn't, her mother would be nagging about it till the end of time. She hated her mother for this, as well as a number of other things. She was constantly adding things to that list, and this was just another thing to include. Couldn't she just sleep? Ugh, she wished. It felt like forever, but the receptionist finally called her name. Tracy stood, her mom didn't follow, and was lead into one of the rooms. She was expecting to have those really strange couches in there, you know, the ones you see in the movies all the time with people laying down on them, confessing their sins to lighten their souls. To her surprise, there was just two regular chairs. She shrugged and took the more comfortable looking of the two. Lesser of two evils, she supposed. Minutes later, a woman walked in. Tracy kept her seat, cocking a brow at the 'doctor.' This woman was tall and pale, freckles covering half of her face. Her eyes were soft and green, bright even in this crappy-ass lighting. Her hair was a bright, fiery red and pulled back into a pony-tail. She offered her hand. \"Tracy?\" Trace looked down to her hand and back to her face. She didn't move. The woman just smiled shortly and sat down in the other chair, picking up a notebook and a pen. There was an awkward silence but she broke it. \"Well, Tracy,\" she continued, writing something down on the yellow paper. \"..My name is Dr. Valerie Williamson… You can call me Val.\" What the hell was I gonna call you? Tracy thought. \"Nice to meet you, Val.\" She sighed. Not. It was NOT nice to meet you, Val. Go the FUCK away. 'Val' smiled and nodded. \"Well, you're mother told me you had some problems recently. Do you want to tell me about that?\" Tracy rolled her eyes. There was another awkward silence. She sucked on her teeth, running her tongue over them. She didn't want to talk, she didn't want to express her feelings, she didn't want to do anything really other than sleep, but that wasn't one of her options. \"Well,\" Val said. \"Are you going to talk to me? I know this might be a little intimidating and frightening, but--\" \"Intimidating?\" Tracy growled. Did she actually fucking say that? \"Frightening? Who and the hell said I was scared?\" Her leg started to twitch. Val noticed it right away. She looked back to Tracy's eyes. \"…I didn't say that you were afraid; I said that this experience could be frightening… For other people, of course.\" She nodded. \"Can't we talk at least?\" No. \"Can you tell me what you're favorite foods are?\" No. \"…Or what about your favorite kind of music?\" Tracy sighed as she sat up. \"Let's see… My favorite food is pizza.\" She nodded. \"My favorite music is anything that doesn't come out of your mouth.\" She said. Val's eyes narrowed. \"Be specific, Tracy. What's your favorite bands?\"\"I don't fucking know,\" she shot back. \"Anything that comes on the radio. Whatever I can dance to…\" She started to twist her hair around her finger, staring off into a blank space.\"Oh,\" Val continued to write. \"So you like to dance?\"\"Yeah,\" Tracy shrugged. \"I like to dance, though it's better when I'm high.\" Val's eyes widened. \"I'm fucking with you. God damn…\" She sat up. The shrink forced a smile and sighed. \"Do I make you uncomfortable, Tracy?\" \"No.\" \"Is there a reason you don't want to talk to me? Even about normal things?\" Val's brow raised, making weird patterns in her forehead. Tracy stared at it for a little while but then something broke her thoughts. She looked to Val's eyes. \"Yeah, there is actually.\" Val stiffened up, waiting for her explanation. \"First of all, you don't know me so how and the fuck can you tell me what to do and how to do it? If you don't know me, how and the hell are you going to help me? You sit there, all high and mighty, and judge people on their thoughts and their 'not-so-normal' hobbies and shit.. You sit there and say, 'Oh yes, and how the fuck does that feel? How the FUCK do you think it makes me feel?\" She yelled. \"You can ask a thousand damn questions, but you'll NEVER know who I really am. You'll never know what I think and why I do what I do, or act the way I act. I don't need any fucking shrink to tell me what I did was wrong, because I knew it was wrong but it was the best damn time of my life! I don't need you to tell me what I need to do to change my life to make it better because I already know. I don't need you to tell me--\" \"Then if you know how to make yourself feel better in a healthier way, or if you know how to chance your life to make it better, then why didn't you?\" Val interrupted. \"Because… Because I… I…\" Tracy countered. \"I'm here to try to get to know you. I'm here to try to help you with the things you can't help yourself with. You cut yourself because you didn't know what else to do with yourself; you cut because you thought it was the only way you could feel something real, whether it be pleasure or pain. You just wanted to feel something, or perhaps feel nothing at all. You wanted control, you craved it. And you got it, didn't you?\" Tracy said nothing. She just looked away from her. \"I'm not like the ones you've heard about on t.v. or what you've seen in movies. I'm different, and it's probably one of the reasons you're mother brought you here to see me instead of to someone else.\" \"And what reason is that?\" Tracy asked sharply. \"Because,\" Val paused. \"She knew that if I couldn't get through to you, no one could. I'm here to try to get to know you, but I can't unless you let me. Right now, all I see, all I'm getting to know is a cold, hard bitch… and I don't think that's who you really are… Is it Tracy?\" Tracy still said nothing. Val continued. \"I'm not just 'some shrink' from the phone book. I can be your friend, if you let me. I've been through some of the things you've experienced, first hand, and that's why it's easy for me to relate to people that have issues they can't deal with themselves because I used to be one of them. Do you hear me, Tracy?\" She leaned forward. \"I used to be like you.\" It was silent again. Tracy didn't know what to say. Valerie gave a smile. \"I'll see you the same time on Thursday, okay?\" Tracy stood and shrugged. \"Yeah, guess so.\" She walked passed Val, out towards the waiting room where her mother was waiting patiently. How dare she make her come here? She turned around to see Val looking straight at her. Why did she feel different now? Even… just a little bit. No, she thought to herself. Don't let it happen. Don't put yourself in that crazy corner, she told herself. Tracy's turned away nonchalantly. It was time to leave. ","Summary":" Chapter 1 - You're Going Tracy glared at her mother from the couch.

Mir gehören also weder Cub noch Cottia, obwohl sie im Film nicht vorkamen. Anm.: Ich würde mich sehr über Reviews freuen.^^ Seit der Rückkehr des Adlers der Neunten Legion war ein Jahr vergangen und Vieles hatte sich verändert. Obwohl die Standarte wieder da war hatte der Senat beschlossen, die Neunte nicht wiederauferstehen zu lassen, da sie schon vor ihrem Verschwinden in Verruf geraten war. Manche hatten sie sogar für verhext gehalten, nachdem sie den Aufstand der Incenerkönigin Boudicca niedergeschlagen hatte. Die Königin hatte sich das Leben genommen, die Neunte jedoch zuvor verflucht. Nach dem Verschwinden der Legion nördlich des Walls war gemunkelt worden, dass sich der Fluch der Keltenkönigin erfüllt hatte. Nichtsdestotrotz wurden Marcus und Esca belohnt. Esca hatte das Bürgerrecht erhalten und war nun nicht mehr länger nur ein freigelassener Sklave, sondern ein römischer Vollbürger. Marcus, dessen rechtes Bein steif geworden war, hatte sich entschieden, sein Leben als römischer Soldat zu beenden und sich in Britannien niederzulassen. Er erhielt vom Senat die gleiche Gratifikation wie ein Kohorten-Centurio nach Beendigung seiner Dienstzeit: ein Stück Land und genug Sesterzen, um fürs erste über die Runden zu kommen. Marcus hatte seinen Onkel gebeten, seinen Einfluss geltend zu machen, damit er ein Stück Land in den Downs bekam, jenem weichen Hügelland, das ihm so ans Herz gewachsen war. Und wirklich, er bekam Land in der Nähe von Calleva, wo sein Onkel seinen Lebensabend verbrachte, zugesichert. Aber das war nicht die größte Veränderung in seinem Leben. In der Zeit, die er bei seinem Onkel gewohnt hatte, hatte er Gefühle für die Icenerin Cottia, die Nichte seines Nachbarn entwickelt. Nach Beendigung seines Abenteuers hatte er sie dann auch geheiratet. Von dem Geld des Senats und Cottias Mitgift (und natürlich einem fähigen Architekten, einem Baumeister und einem Heer von Arbeitern) konnte Marcus auf seinem Grund und Boden ein ansehnliches Steinhaus errichten, in dem es sich aushalten ließ. Hier lebte er nun mit seinem Haushalt, der aus seiner Frau, ein paar Freigelassenen, seinem zahmen Wolf Cub und Esca bestand. Als Marcus ihn nach seinen Plänen gefragt hatte, hatte er kurz überlegt und gesagt: \"Ich bleibe bei dir. Irgendjemand muss doch dafür sorgen, dass du nicht wieder zum Vollblutrömer wirst, Bruder.\" Da hatte Marcus lachen müssen. \"Ich bin ein Römer und werde immer einer sein. Du bist auch Römer, vergiss das nicht.\" Esca hatte verächtlich geaschnaubt: \"Ich bin kein Römer, ich bin Brigant!\" Und damit war die Sache erledigt gewesen und Marcus hatte seinen Architekten, einen quirligen Griechen namens Alexandros, angewiesen, in sein neues Haus auch keltische Elemente miteinzubeziehen, damit sich Cottia und Esca wohler fühlten. Zuerst hatte Alexandros sich geweigert und ein Gesicht gemacht, als hätte Marcus ihn hinterrücks erdolcht, doch plötzlich (anscheinend hatte ihn die Muse geküsst) hatte er seinen Auftraggeber stehenlassen und hatte fieberhaft Muster auf Wachstäfelchen gekritzelt. Das Endergebnis konnte sich sehen lassen. Römisch-Keltisch. Nach Cottias und Escas Meinung war das Haus der beste Beweis dafür, dass Marcus doch nicht so ein Vollblutrömer war, wie er gerne behauptete. Aber diese Erkenntnis behielten die beiden für sich. Nachdem Marcus und sein kleiner Haushalt in ihr neues Heim übersiedelt waren begannen sie, Felder anzulegen. Onkel Aquila schenkte seinem Neffen zur Hauseinweihung eine kleine Schafherde, die dieser nur unter Protest (\"Nein, das ist wirklich zu viel, ich...\" - \"Jetzt sei still und freu dich!\") annahm. Die Wolle brachte gutes Geld ein und Marcus konnte es sich leisten, Feldfrüchte und Getreide anzubauen. Finanziell lief alles gut, ebenso wie privat. Marcus musste sich erst daran gewöhnen, verheiratet zu sein. Sein bisheriges Leben hatte er unter Soldaten zugebracht, also dauerte die Eingewöhnung ein bisschen. Aber Cottia war geduldig. Sie wusste, Marcus liebte sie über alles, auch wenn er manchmal Schwierigkeiten hatte, es zu zeigen. Die zierliche, rothaarige Icenerin mit den goldenen Augen hingegen fand sich schnell in die Haushaltsführung ein. Es machte ihr Spaß, einem Haushalt vorzustehen und die Zügel in der Hand zu haben. Langsam wurde es wieder Frühling und der wenige Schnee, der in den Downs gefallen war, schmolz unter den ersten warmen Sonnenstrahlen dahin. Cottia hatte das Haus eine Weile für sich alleine gehabt, da Marcus für ein paar Tage nach Calleva gereist war um seinen Onkel zu besuchen und Esca vor drei Wochen in den Norden aufgebrochen war. Er wollte versuchen, seinen guten Ruf nördlich des Walls wiederherzustellen. Cottia hatte sich große Sorgen gemacht und versucht, ihm sein Vorhaben auszureden. Sie glaubte nicht wirklich, dass man ihm den Diebstahl des römischen Adlers verzeihen würde. Marcus hingegen hatte ihm einfach nur eine \"gute Jagd\" gewünscht. Er hatte sogar angeboten, Esca zu begleiten. Esca hatte jedoch dankend abgelehnt und gemeint, dass man Marcus, Römer der er war, sofort umbringen würde. Ihm würden die Stämme nie verzeihen. Cottia saß am Fenster ihrer Schlafkammer und seufzte. Sie konnte verstehen, wie sehr es Esca schmerzte, von seinen Leuten nicht mehr respektiert zu werden. Sie selbst verspürte jedoch kein Heimweh nach ihrem Stamm. Gleich nach dem Tod ihres Vaters hatte ihre Mutter einen Jäger geheiratet, in den sie schon lange verliebt gewesen war. Cottia hatte sie zu ihrer Schwester Valeria nach Calleva geschickte. Valeria war eine gute Frau, die von Rom ganz besessen war. Sie hatte Cottia \"Camilla\" genannt und wollte eine echte Römerin aus ihr machen. Ganz begeistert war sie gewesen, als Cottia und Marcus geheiratet hatten. Sie vergötterte ihren Schwiegersohn. Cottia hatte sich immer als Icenerin gefühlt, aber erst seit sie Marcus´ Frau geworden war fühlte sie sich wieder richtig zuhause. Cub, Marcus´ zahmer Wolf, gab ein gurgelndes Geräusch von sich und legte seinen schweren Kopf auf Cottias Knie. Sie kraulte ihn hinter den Ohren. \"Immerhin bist du noch da, Hübscher. Du weißt nicht, wann Marcus wiederkommt, oder?\" Cub bellte. Das hatte er sich angewöhnt, da er mit Onkel Aquilas Hunden aufgewachsen war. \"Du weißt es?\" Der Wolf bellte wieder, wedelte mit dem Schwanz und rannte zur Tür. Cottia folgte ihm in den Vorhof. Und wirklich, in der Ferne war die Gestalt eines Reiters auszumachen. Cub sprang begeistert auf und ab. Cottia lachte. \"Du kleiner Teufel. Woher hast du das gewusst?\" Statt einer Antwort rannte Cub seinem Herrn entgegen und riss ihn fast vom Pferd. Cottia ging etwas langsamer hinterher. Marcus freute sich offensichtlich über die enthusiasische Begrüßung. Er stieg vom Pferd, strich Cub liebevoll übers Fell und blieb dann verlegen vor Cottia stehen. Er wusste immer noch nicht genau, wie man seine Ehefrau nach einwöchiger Trennung begrüßte. Cottia grinste und fiel Marcus um den Hals. \"Willkommen daheim.\" Marcus erwiederte die Umarmung. \"Danke. Du... hast mir...äh...gefehlt.\" \"Du mir auch. Wie geht´s deinem Onkel?\" \"Ganz gut. Er arbeitet noch immer an seiner Geschichte über die Belagerungskriege. Er lässt dich grüßen und hat mir aufgetragen, dich nächstes mal mitzunehmen.\" \"Sehr schön. Tu das.\" \"Woher hast du eigentlich gewusst, dass ich heute komme?\" erkundigte sich Marcus, während er seinen Wolf unterm Kinn kraulte. \"Hab ich nicht. Cub hat´s gewusst.\" antwortete Cottia. Marcus lachte leise. \"Guter Junge...Wie sieht´s hier aus? Probleme?\" \"Nein, alles bestens.\" \"Hast du was von Esca gehört?\" erkundigte sich Marcus. Seine Frau schüttelte den Kopf. \"Nicht, nichts. Es geht ihm sicher gut, mach dir keine Sorgen. Wer weiß, vielleicht kommt er heute noch. Schau dir an, wie unruhig Cub ist.\" Und wirklich, der Wolf rannte auf und ab, unterbrach sich manchmal und starrte auf die gepflasterte Straße, die nach Norden führte. Langsam kamen auch die Freigelassenen, die Marcus beschäftigte, um ihn zu begrüßen und sich um sein Pferd zu kümmern. Marcus und Cottia gingen ins Haus und Marcus berichtete über seinen Aufenthalt in Calleva, gab seiner Frau einen Brief von ihrer Tante und hörte sich an, was sich während seiner Abwesenheit ereignet hatte. Als es keine familiären Neuigkeiten mehr zu berichten gab und die Sonne langsam im Westen versank, machte sich Cottia daran, gemeinsam mit Brighid, ihrer irischen Köchin, das Abendessen zuzubereiten. Da begann Cub, der im Garten umhergetollt war, wieder zu bellen. \"Hallo, Bruder Wolf!\" sagte eine wohlbekannte Stimme gut gelaunt. Cottia lief zur Schreibstube ihres Mannes, der gerade ihre Finanzen prüfte. \"Marcus, Esca ist wieder da.\" Marcus sprang auf, beherrschte sich aber sofort wieder. \"Sehr schön.\" sagte er lächelnd und ging nach draußen, um seinen Freund zu begrüßen. Cottia folgte ihm kopfschüttelnd. Männer. War es wirklich so schlimm, Gefühle zu zeigen? Lugh bewahre, dass man ihnen die Freude über die Rückkehr eines Waffenbruders ansah. Oder irgendeine andere Regung. \"Esca, du lebst noch.\" sagte Marcus zum Gruß. \"Wie du siehst.\" gab Esca zurück. Die beiden starrten sich einen Augenblick stumm an, dann grinsten sie und packten einander an den Unterarmen. Händeschütteln unter echten Männern, dachte Cottia amüsiert. \"Schön, dich wiederzusehen!\" begrüßte sie den Briganten und schenkte ihm ein breites Lächeln. Irgendwie musste sie ja die Zurückhaltung ihres Mannes wettmachen. \"Du kommst genau zur rechten Zeit. Es gibt gleich Essen.\" \"So? Das ist gut. Ah, ich riech´s schon. Wild in Weinsoße, wenn mich meine Nase nicht täuscht?\" \"Sie täuscht dich nicht. Marcus ist auch erst heute zurückgekommen, da wollte ich etwas ganz Besonderes machen.\" Esca gluckste. \"Ein Glück. Dein Wild in Weinsoße hätt´ ich um nichts auf der Welt verpassen wollen.\" sagte er. Es machte ihm zwar nichts aus, von rohen Feldmäusen zu leben, wenn die Situation es erforderte, aber trotzdem wusste er gutes Essen zu schätzen. Bevor noch jemand etwas sagen konnte kam Brighid, die irische Köchin, heraus und bat die Herrschaften zu Tisch. Als sie alle am Tisch saßen und einen Teller mit dampfendem Fleisch vor sich stehen hatten, fragte Marcus: \"Wie ist es in Caledonia, entschuldige, Albu gelaufen?\" Esca ließ sich Zeit mit seiner Antwort. \"Ganz gut, denk ich.\" sagte er langsam. \"Ich war zuerst bei Guerns Witwe. Zuerst wollte sie mich gar nicht sehen, aber dann... Wir haben lange geredet, darüber, was es bedeutet, Römer oder Britannier zu sein. Über die Loyalität, die ein Mann seiner Heimat und seiner Familie schuldet. Sie hat mir erzählt, dass Guern nie ganz aufgehört hat, ein Römer zu sein. Hin und wieder hat er Streifzüge unternommen... zu verfallenen Römerlagern... sie hat immer geahnt, dass er sich der Vergangenheit einmal stellen würde, hat sie gesagt. Letztenendes haben wir uns als Freunde getrenn. Sie ist bei den Selgovern für mich eingetreten... Ich habe viele andere Stämme besucht. Trotz der Sache mit dem Adler gilt mein Name im Süden noch etwas, ich weiß nicht warum. Je weiter ich in den Norden ging, desto feindseliger wurden die Stämme jedoch. Kann ich ihnen nicht verdenken.\" Esca wirkte traurig. \"Der Seehundclan hat seinen Nachbarn beigebracht, mich zu verachten... Aber ich hoffe, dass mir die Stämme im Süden freundlich gesinnt bleiben. Und irgendwann, irgendwie werde ich meinen guten Namen wiederherstellen.\" sagte er. Marcus musterte seinen Freund. \"Was verschweigst du mir?\" Esca seufzte tief. \"Ich verschweige nichts. Ich überlege nur, wie ich... weitermachen soll.\" \"Einfach raus damit.\" \"Römer treiben sich in Albu herum. Sie verschleppen Burschen, die noch nicht zu Kriegern geworden sind. Angeblich im Auftrag eines Gladiatorenmeisers.\" berichtete er mit belegter Stimme. \"Marcus, ich muss nach Rom. Wenn ich die Jungen befreien kann, dann...\" \"...ist dein guter Name wiederhergestellt. \" beendete Marcus den Satz. Dann fiel ihm etwas ein. \"Warte! Gladiatoren, sagst du? Als ich bei meinem Onkel war, hat er mir einen seiner Freunde vorgestellt. Einen Veteran der Sechsten, der jetzt in Rom wohnt. Er war bei meinem Onkel um ihn um Rat zu bitten. Er hat durch einen Informanten, von dessen Glaubwürdigkeit er nicht überzeugt ist, erfahren, dass ein gewisser Titus Albanius Corvus, ein entfernter Verwandter des Kaisers, ein bisschen Unruhe stifte will, den Kaiser womöglich sogar zwingen will, ihn zu seinem Nachfolger zu ernennen, und zwar mit Hilfe eines Herren, der nur unter dem passenden Namen Pugnus, die Faust, bekannt ist und eine Gladiatorenschule leitet. Angeblich hat er einen Haufen neuer, KELTISCHER, Schüler. Aber, wie gesagt, es gibt keinen einzigen Beweis, vielleicht ist das nur leeres Gerede und Corvus hat einfach nur eine Vorliebe für Gladiatoren...\" Esca knurrte. \"Dieser römische Hurensohn! Wir Britannier lassen uns nicht wie Ochsen vor einen Karren spannen, zur Belustigung dieses - dieses - Argh!\" Er schlug mit der Faust auf den Tisch. \"Begleitest du mich nach Rom, Bruder?\" \"Du hast mir damals geholfen, die Ehre meiner Familie wiederherzustellen. Natürlich komm ich mit!\"[Chapter 2] Eine Woche später brachen Marcus und Esca auf. Zuerst hatte Marcus einen Boten zu seinem Onkel gesandt und ihn gebeten, seinen Freund zu überzeugen, Marcus und Esca mit dem Fall zu betrauen. Die Zusage kam promt, gemeinsam mit einer Einladung in dessen Haus in Rom, bis sie eine eigene Bleibe gefunden hatten. Cottia war zwar nicht besonders glücklich über die Abreise ihres Mannes, machte aber keinen Versuch, ihn davon abzuhalten. Sie küsste Marcus zum Abschied. \"Mach aber keine Dummheiten, ja?\" Marcus lachte. \"Das wird sich nicht vermeiden lassen, fürchte ich. \" \"Keine Sorge, ich bring ihn dir wieder. Wenn möglich in einem Stück.\" warf Esca ein, der gerade noch einmal den Sattelgurt seines Pferdes überprüfte. Marcus sah Cottia in die Augen und senkte die Stimme. \"Ich liebe dich.\" murnelte er. Dann, wieder mit lauterer Stimme. \"Pass auf Cub auf.\" \"Wie immer.\" Dann ritten sie los. Ihr Ziel war Dubris. Von dort wollten sie ein Schiff nach Gallien nehmen und dann auf den breiten, gepflasterten Straßen nach Rom reiten. Nachdem sie eine Weile schweigend nebeneinander hergeritten waren, fragte Esca: \"Bist du schon oft gereist?\" \"Nicht wirklich. Etrurien, Rom, Britannien. Warum?\" \"Hm. Nur so... Erzähl mir von Rom.\" In Marcs´ Gesicht trat ein verklärter Ausdruck. \"Rom ist unvergleichlich. So viele Menschen auf einem Fleck findest du auf der ganzen Welt kein zweites Mal. Dort gibt es nichts, was du nicht kaufen kannst: Waffen, Gewürze, Pferde... Was dein Herz begehrt.\" Esca zog die Brauen hoch. \"So? Und was kostet mich das?\" \"Kommt drauf an. Wenn die Waren von weit her kommen und der Transport gefährlich war, sind sie natürlich teurer.\" \"Gibt´s noch mehr zu tun als nur einzukaufen?\" fragte Esca mit einem Schmunzeln. Er hatte zwar schon von Rom gehört, aber er hatte sich nie etwas darunter vorstellen können. Marcus nickte eifrig. \"Natürlich. Du kannst so gut wie alles tun! Es gibt Badehäuser, Bibliotheken, Theater, Arenen, Tavernen... Es ist, alls wäre dort die ganze Welt zusammengefasst. \" Esca strich seinem Pferd nachdenklich über die Mähne und unterdrückte ein Seufzen. Marcus warf ihm einen fragenden Blick zu, sagte aber nichts. Zwei Tage später trafen sie in Dubris ein, einem verhältnismäßig großen Dorf, das um den Hafen herum entstanden war. Der Himmer war von einem kalten, stählernen grau, das Rauschen und der salzige Geruch des Meeres waren hier allgegenwärtig. Ein römischer Soldat näherte sich den beiden und sagte gelangweilt: \"Namen.\" \"Marcus Flavius Aquila und Esca Mac Cunoval.\" gab Marcus zurück. \"Aquila? Der Sohn vom alten Aquila von der Neunten?\" erkundigte sich der Soldat mit plötzlich erwachtem Interesse. \"Ja.\" In Marcus´ Gesicht zuckte ein Muskel. Der Soldat wollte noch eine Bemerkung machen, schluckte sie aber herunter, als er den Gesichtsausdruck des jungen Mannes bemerkte und winkte sie weiter. \"Ich hab zwar gewusst, dass der Senat die Wiederbeschaffung des Adlers unter Verschluss gehalten hat, aber irgendwie hab ich doch gehofft, dass die Bemerkungen aufhören würden.\" knurrte Marcus, als sie wenig später am Pier entlanggingen und nach der \"Selkie\" Ausschau hielten. Esca runzelte die Stirn. \"Wie kommt es eigentlich, dass jeder Römer darüber bescheid zu wissen scheint?\" Marcus schüttelte den Kopf. \"Soweit ich weiß redet man nur noch in Britannien darüber. In Rom kräht kein Hahn mehr danach. Hoff ich zumindest... Aber immerhin... ich weiß, was passiert ist. Ich weiß, dass mein Vater als Soldat gestorben ist. Ehrenhaft.\" Esca nickte. Auch wenn er seinen römischen Freund oft nicht verstand, das konnte er nachvollziehen. Sein eigener Vater war im Kampf gegen die Römer gefallen, deswegen galt sein Name heute noch etwas. Esca selbst hatte seinen guten Namen verloren, als er Marcus geholfen hatte, seinen wiederzubeschaffen. Nun musste er seinen Leuten beweisen, dass er der Sohn seines Vaters war. Die \"Selkie\" war nicht besonders groß. Sie verkehre regelmäßig zwischen Gallien und Britannien, erklärte der Kapitän stolz, den sie letztendlich in einer schäbigen Taverne gefunden hatten. Bald darauf war das Schiff reisefertig und jeder an seinem Platz. Marcus und Esca standen an der Reling und versuchten, die gallische Küste durch den Nebel auszumachen. Da fiel Marcus etwas ein. \"Warst du eigentlich schon mal auf See?\" \"Ich bin ab und zu mit einem Boot zum Fischen rausgefahren. Ich war aber noch nie auf einem richtigen Schiff.\" \"Also wirst du nicht seekrank.\" Esca schüttelte den Kopf. \"Bin seefest. Du?\" Marcus versuchte, sich an seine Überfahrt nach Britannien zu erinnern, aber es gelang ihm nicht. Wahrscheinlich hatte er geschlafen... \"Ja, ich auch.\" In diesem Moment legte die Selkie ab und steuerte unter den gebrüllten Befehlen des Kapitäns mit geblähten Segeln aufs offene Meer zu. Marcus spürte, wie ihm flau im Magen wurde. Er atmete tief ein. Bei Mithras, das war ungut... Je weiter sich die Selkie von der Küste entfernet, desto höher wurde der Wellengang. Einatmen, ausatmen, einatmen, ausatmen... Das war schließlich nur eine gewöhnliche Überfahrt, nichts besonderes... \"Seekrank?\" Esca konnte sich ein kleines Grinsen nicht verkneifen. \"Nein-\" knurrte Marcus. Dann beugte er sich über die Reling und würgte. \"Lass es raus, Bruder.\" Marcus setzte zu einer bissigen Antwort an, kam aber nicht zum Reden, da er sich verschluckte und zu husten begann. \"Ausspucken, nicht runterschlucken.\" war Escas wenig hilfreicher Kommentar. Marcus machte mit der linken Hand eine obszöne Geste, musste sich aber gleich wieder mit beiden Händen festhalten, da seine Beine zu zittern begannen. Eine halbe Stunde später war sein Magen völlig leer und er ließ sich auf eine Kiste fallen, die neben ihm vertäut war. \"Anscheinend hab ich meine letzte Überfahrt verdrängt\" krächzte er und lehnte sich an die Bordwand. Sein Gesicht hatte einen merkwürdig grünen Farbton angenommen. \"Wir sollten uns langsam einen Plan zurechtlegen.\" Esca warf Marcus einen zweifelnden Blick zu. \"Das hat auch bis morgen Zeit. Wenn´s dir wieder einigermaßen gut geht.\" \"Mir geht´s gut.\" sagte Marcus. Zur Bekräftigung beugte er sich noch einmal würgend über die Bordwand. \"Soll ich dich bewusstlos schlagen?\" \"Nicht nötighgh... wääh... deinen spöttischen Ton kannst du dir in den A-...\" er würgte und begann wieder zu husten \"schieben.\"' Die Stunden vergingen. Als die \"Selkie\" in Gallien anlegte wurde es bereits Abend. Marcus hing völlig ausgepumt über der Reling. \"Lebst du noch?\" gluckste Esca. Ein gurgelndes Geräusch war die Antwort. \"Wir sind da, du kannst aufstehen.\" Marcus versuchte es, knickte aber wieder ein. Der Brigant schüttelte den Kopf und zog ihn auf die Beine. Auf Esca gestützt gelang es Marcus, das Schiff einigermaßen würdevoll (also ohne sich zu übergeben oder der Länge nach hinzufallen) zu verlassen. Esca setzte Marcus unter einer Eiche ab und ging noch einmal zurück, um ihre Pferde zu holen, die gerade vom Schiff gebracht wurden. Er band die Beiden an der Eiche an, holde Brot und Käse und verdünnten Wein aus den Satteltaschen und setzte sich neben Marcus. \"Auch was? Ich bin am verhungern.\" Marcus, immer noch grün im Gesicht, machte eine abwehrende Handbewegung, griff sich aber den Weinschlauch und spülte seinen Mund ein paar mal aus. \"Nie. Wieder. Auf dem Rückweg schwimm ich. Ertrinken ist bestimmt angenehmer als das.\"[Chapter 3] Eigentlich hatten Marcus und Esca vorgehabt, sich eine Herberge zu suchen, aber der Abend war lau und das Wetter schön, also beschlossen sie, Geld zu sparen und im Freien zu übernachten. Marcus fing sich langsam wieder, er konnte sogar etwas essen. „Also…\" sagte er kauend. „Nach Rom brauchen wir ungefähr zehn Tage. Titus Cosconius\" – das war Onkel Aquilas Freund – „bleibt noch ein Weilchen in Calleva, aber er hat seiner Familie eine Nachricht geschrieben, dass wir ein paar Tage bei ihnen unterkommen.\" „Mhmm. Dann müssen wir diesen Römer finden.\" „Welchen von Beiden?\" „Pugnus…\" Dann schluckte Esca, als müsse er sich erst dazu überwinden, weiter zu sprechen. „Ich werde mich als dein Sklave ausgeben, du verkaufst mich an ihn und dann… dann sehen wir weiter.\" „Du willst wieder in der Arena kämpfen?\" „Wollen? Nein. Fällt dir was Besseres ein?\" „Hm. Nein. Aber es ist keine gute Idee, dich an ihn zu verkaufen. Wenn er für dich bezahlt, bist du sein Eigentum. Wenn du davonläufst wirst du gejagt. Rom versteht keinen Spaß mit flüchtigen Sklaven.\" sagte Marcus langsam. „Vielleicht… wenn ich ihn dafür bezahle, dich auszubilden…\" „Warum sollte er darauf eingehen?\" fragte Esca. „Auf das Eigentum anderer muss man Acht geben. Ist doch lustiger, wenn man seine eigenen Sklaven über die Klinge springen lässt:\" Er schnaubte angewidert. „Und kostspieliger. Einen ausgebildeten Gladiator zu verlieren ist, finanziell gesehen, ein herber Schlag für eine kleine Arena. Wenn ich für alles bezahle und dafür, sagen wir, die Hälfte vom Gewinn einstreiche, trägt Pugnus selbst eigentlich kein Risiko. Aber bist du sicher…?\" „Ich hab zwei Jahre lang in der Arena in Calleva gekämpft. Ein paar Wochen in Rom dürfte ich schon noch überleben.\" Esca versuchte sich an einem Schmunzeln. Es gelang ihm nicht. „Aber in Calleva wurdest du besiegt und fast getötet.\" „Ich wollte getötet werden. Ein Leben als Gladiator ist kein Leben.\" Marcus musste grinsen. „Rom ist nicht Calleva, Esca. Wir Römer lieben unsere Gladiatoren.\" „Ach was. Du auch?\" zischte Esca. Er wirkte plötzlich zornig. „Ab und zu ein paar Schaukämpfe, ja.\" Dann erst fiel ihm auf, was er gesagt hatte. „Du weißt, was ich meine, Esca. Du kennst mich doch!\" „Ja ja… Wenn man noch nie auf der falschen Seite der Arena war, kann man das noch so sehen.\" sagte der Brigant und warf einen Ast ins Feuer, das munter vor sich hin flackerte. Marcus konnte nicht umhin, sich ein bisschen zu schämen. „Kann sein.\" murmelte er. Esca schien ihn nicht zu hören. Er starrte düster in die Flammen, die Hände unbewusst schützend über die gekerbten Ohren gelegt, die ihn als Sklaven kennzeichneten. Marcus räusperte sich unbehaglich. Er wusste, dass seine gedankenlose Bemerkung und die Tatsache, dass er bald wieder in einer Arena stehen würde, Esca an seine Zeit als Gladiator denken ließen. Eine Zeit, über die er nie sprach, die er zu verdrängen versuchte. „Esca!\" Der Britannier zuckte leicht zusammen und nahm die Hände von den Ohren. Er sah Marcus mit seinen grauen Augen an. „Was?\" „Alles… in Ordnung?\" Esca nickte langsam, in den Augen immer noch der gehetzte Ausdruck. „Böse Erinnerungen.\" sagte er nur. „Hm.\" Marcus wusste nicht, was er darauf sagen sollte. Bis vor ein, zwei Jahren hatte er nichts dabei gefunden, Sklaven zu besitzen oder sich Gladiatorenkämpfe anzusehen. Dann war Esca gekommen. Er konnte seinen Landsmännern jedoch nicht vorwerfen, dass sie – nun ja, dass sie wie echte Römer dachten. „Als mein Stamm… besiegt worden war… und sie mich holten…\" begann Esca mit belegter Stimme „…ich hab mich dafür gehasst, dass ich nicht im Kampf gegen sie gestorben bin… sonder lebte und… mich versklaven ließ. Ich kann mich … nicht mehr genau an alles erinnern… nur dass ich Angst hatte…furchtbare Angst. Ich hab ihre Sprache so gut wie gar nicht verstanden… Dann haben sie mich an einen Sklavenhändler verkauft… und meine Ohren durchstochen.\" Er fuhr sich durch die Haare. Seine Hände zitterten. Marcus lief ein kalter Schauer über den Rücken. Sie, das waren die Römer. Seine Landsleute. Er konnte nur ahnen, wie viel Überwindung es Esca kosten musste, nach Rom zu reisen und wieder Sklave zu sein. Marcus legte seinem Freund eine Hand auf die Schulter. Dieser atmete tief durch, bevor er weiter sprach. „Wie hab ich die Arena gehasst. Den geifernden Pöbel, der Geld bezahlt, um gebrochene, unfreie Männer sterben zu sehen… Was sag ich, Männer… Tiere. Wir waren wie Tiere. Alle nur darauf aus, ein lächerliches kleines Holzschwert zu bekommen. Dafür haben wir uns verkauft. Haben uns schreckliche Dinge angetan, nur zur Belustigung von ihnen.\" Escas Stimme, die zu einem Flüstern geworden war, verstummte. „Diesmal ist es anders.\" sagte Marcus leise und eindringlich „Wenn irgendwas schief geht hol ich dich da raus. Das verspreche ich dir.\" Esca nickte und legte eine Hand auf Marcus´, die immer noch auf seiner Schulter lag. „Danke, Bruder.\" Mehr gab es nicht zu sagen. Marcus übernahm die erste Wache, Esca rollte sich in seinen Mantel und schlief ein. Schon früh am nächsten Morgen ritten sie weiter nach Nord-Westen. Zu Mittag kamen sie an einen Fluss. „Das ist die Sequana. Wenn wir an ihr entlang reiten sind wir in ein paar Stunden in Lutetia.\" erklärte Marcus. „Lutetia?\" „Die größte Stadt in Gallien. Bin auf meiner Reise nach Britannien durchgekommen. Lutetia ist zwar nicht so groß wie Rom, aber gesehen muss man es trotzdem haben.\" „Wieso? Ist eine Stadt nicht wie die andere?\" Marcus schüttelte energisch den Kopf. „Ü-ber-haupt nicht. Lutetia besteht aus drei Teilen, weißt du. Eine Insel in der Sequana und jeweils ein Stadtteil rechts und links davon. Links ist das Stadtzentrum, rechts die Vorstadt. Die Teile werden durch Brücken verbunden.\" „Du hättest Reiseführer werden sollen, nicht Bauer…Wohnen dort nur Römer?\" „Teilst du die Welt nur in Römer und Nicht-Römer ein?\" Esca überlegte kurz. „Hm. Ja.\" „Na dann. Nein, auch Gallier. Soweit ich weiß ist die einheimische Bevölkerung hier den britannischen Kelten ziemlich ähnlich.\" Escas Interesse war geweckt. „So? Na, ein kleiner Abstecher kann nicht schaden.\"[Chapter 4] \"So, das isses. Das einzige Zimmer, das noch frei is. Haste Glück gehabt...\" Jovial schlug der Gastwirt Marcus auf die Schulter und stieß dann eine Tür auf. Das Zimmer dahinter war klein, schmutzig und roch nicht besonders gut. Dafür war es billig. Außerdem hatte es bereits gedämmert, als Marcus und Esca in Lutetia angekommen waren, und keiner der beiden fühlte ein besonderes Verlagen danach, in einer so großen Stadt Nachts auf den Straßen herum zu vagabundieren. Also hatten sie sich beeilt, eine Herberge zu finden und waren schließlich in der \"blauen Sequana\" hängengeblieben. Die Eigentümer waren gallische Kelten (eine gute Gelegenheit für Esca, seine \"Landsleute\" besser kennen zú lernen) und die Ostseite des Hauses hatte Blick auf den Fluss. \"Soll ich deinen Sklaven im Stall unterbringen? Da schlafen schon ein paar andere.\" fragte der Wirt und verspielte sofort jegliche Sympathien, die Esca zuvor für ihn empfunden haben mochte. \"Äh... nein danke. Das Zimmer ist groß genug für uns beide.\" Der Wirt nickte vielsagend. \"Weiß schon... Unsere Betten hier sind sehr stabil. Aber die Wände sind dünn.\" sagte er augenzwinkernd. Marcus räusperte sich unbehaglich. \"Moment, Sie missverstehen da - \" Der Wirt unterbrach ihn mit einer Handbewegung. \"Ah geh, schon recht. Solang du zahlst is es mir wurscht, was du treibst.\" sagte er und hielt die Hand auf. Marcus bezahlte und der Wirt verschwand, nicht ohne einen letzten anzüglichen Blick auf den römischen Gutsbesitzer und seinen britannischen Sklaven. Esca zog die Brauen hoch. \"Kann ich gefahrlos hier schlafen oder fällst du mitten in der Nacht über mich her?\" erkundigte er sich mit einem schiefen Lächeln. Marcus war die Sache schrecklich peinlich. \"Das ist nicht witzig.\" sagte er uns setzte sich aufs Bett. \"Irgendwie schon. Eine Frage noch. Bin ich oben oder unten?\" Der Römer musste wider Willen grinsen. \"Du meinst wenn ich dich niedergeschlagen und auf den Grund der Sequana befördet habe? Unten, würde ich sagen.\" \"Na bitte, du hast ja doch Humor...\" \"Nein, jetzt aber ehrlich. Du bist nicht...oder?\" Esca gluckste. \"Du kennst mich jetzt fast zwei Jahre. Das muss du noch fragen?\" \"Na ja... \" \"Nein, bin ich nicht. In unserem Stamm gab´s ein paar, aber darüber wurde nicht geredet.\" gab er achselzuckend. \"Ach so. \" Damit war das Thema beendet. Marcus gähnte. \"Lass uns schlafen gehen. Der Tag war lang... \" \"Ich mach nur noch das Fenster auf. Schwül heute...\" sagte Esca und öffnete die Fensterläden. Von unten drang Geschrei herauf. \"DU WILLST STREIT? LASS MICH, BEATRICE, ICH MACH DEN KERL FERTIG! ICH -\" Er schloss die Läden wieder. \"Die spinnen, die Lutetier...\" murmelte er und zog seine Tunika aus. \"Gute Idee eigentlich.\" sagte Marcus und zog seine ebenfalls aus. \"Gute Nacht, Esca.\" \"Nacht.\" sagte Esca und warf sich aufs Bett. Der Lattenrost brach mit einem lauten KRACKS! Er sog scharf Luft durch die Zähne. \"Ups...\" \"Kann man so sagen... Lass sehen, vielleicht kann man´s reparieren...\" Marcus beugte sich über die gebrochene Stelle. In diesem Moment ging die Tür auf und der Gastwirt steckte den Kopf herein. \"Alles in... Ooooh, Verzeihung...\" feixte er. Zu seiner Verteidigung muss jedoch gesagt werden, dass er den Römer und den Briganten in einer verfänglichen Stellung erwischt hatte. Er wollte noch etwas sagen, aber Marcus schnitt ihm das Wort ab. \"Keine Angst, wir bezahlen das.\" \"Guuut, guuut... Na dann, ich wünsche noch einen...äh... angenehmen Abend...\" sagte er und schloss die Tür wieder. Marcus seufzte tief. Er war zu müde, um sich groß darüber aufzuregen. \"Stabil, von wegen... Dann schlafen wir wohl auf dem Boden...\" Früh am nächsten Morgen bezahlten Marcus und Esca ihre Rechnung und verschwanden. Den Vormittag verbrachten sie damit, sich Lutetia anzusehen. Danach saßen sie bei Wein und Wildschwein in einer Schenke und besprachen ihre weitere Reise. \"Was hältst du davon, wenn wir gleich heute weiterreiten?\" fragte Marcus. \"Oder willst du noch mehr von Lutetia sehen?\" Esca winkte ab und nahm einen tiefen Schluck aus seinem Krug. \"Eigentlich nicht...

Just my luck! I sighed and compensated for my book. Today it was going to be my first day in my new school and I was very nervous! All the new and foreign faces I was going to meet! I really hoped my first school day wouldn't be that bad! But at least my best friend Tracy will be there, too. We got to know each othere when we had been in the kindergarten and since then we've been the best friends all the time and I like her a lot! In front of the school I waited for Tracy. We had arranged that we would wait for the other one because both of us didn't want to go on her own in the new high school. While waiting Tracy's brother Mason, who is two years older than his sister, came around and I greeted him. I think he's very cute. \"Hey, Noel!\", I heard suddenly a voice behind me. The voice belonged to Tracy. \"Are you ready?\", she wanted to know. \"No\", I responded, \"but I guess we have to.\" \"Yeah, I think so.\" Together we entered the school, happy there was at least one face we knew for sure. In the lunchtime Tracy and I sat together with a few girls we knew by sight from lessons and who were really nice. We had a lot to talk about, because they told us a few things about the school and about the people there. For example: Eve, who was one class above us. She was the main topic of the lunchtime. In the opinion of most boys, she was the hottest and most famous girl of the school, but one girl who ate with us, Sarah, suggested that Eve was a terrible person: she would drink a lot of alcohol, take drugs and her hobby would be playing with cute boys. However, she looked very pretty and smart. \"Hey, Tracy, do we meet us after school?\" \"Yeah, that'd great. Well, I have to go, see you.\", Tracy muttered shortly afterwards and went away. I know it sounds stupid, but it looked like she pursued Eve, who was gone a few minutes ago.[Chapter 2] In the afternoon I waited in front of the gate of the school for Tracy. When she finally came, she was really strange. I had the feeling that she beared something in mind which she didn't want to tell me. Thereinafter, nearby our houses, we walked together with Sarah, she said: \"Sorry, but I have gymnastic.\" \"Ok, bye.\" Then Tracy was gone. I wasn't sure, but I thought she would have gymnastic on another day. Next day, I didn't recognize Tracy first. She was wearing clothes I didn't see on her before apart from the shoes. They were the same shoes I've seen Melrose Avenue but of course that couldn't be because they had been very expensive. That's why I hadn't bought them. \"Hey, Noel. Isn't that Tracy?\" Sarah had appeared besides me. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" When Tracy arrived in front of us I greeted her: \"Hey, Tracy, how are you?\" Tracy smiled and answered: \"Hey, you both.\" \"Hey, Tracy. Come on.\" I looked twice because I couldn't believe my eyes. All of a sudden Evie Zamora showed up and spoke to nobody but Tracy. Since when did they know each other? Or talked to each other? I waited for Tracy to tell Evie that she'd stay with us- like always. But instead, Tracy said: \"See you.\" Then Tracy vanished together with Evie. I didn't understand anything, anymore. What was happening there?[Chapter 3] The next day I saw Tracy every now and then without talking to her. In the lessons we had together she came to late and it seemed she didn't care. Though I had found other friend for example Sarah I missed Tracy. It was just not the same as with Tracy who I've known for so long. First I thought it would be just take a short time til Tracy would recognize that she and Evie were such different persons. So I tried my best to ignore that I was getting on Tracy's nerves. As usual I called her in the afternoons. Either no one hang up or her brother Mason or her mom were saying Tracy wouldn't be at home. I mean, where was she all the time? Did she forget that I was her best friend instead of Evie Zamora? I know in that moment it was clear that Tracy and I weren't friends anymore but though I still missed her and, however, I went to her. Actually, I thought she wouldn't be at home anyway but when I was arriving in her street I saw her- she sat on a blancket outside in front of the house eating pizza with her new best friend Evie. A short moment I wanted to walk away again but then Evie saw me. She whispered something to Tracy who looked at me and rolled her eyes. I tried my best emphasizing I hadn't see it and took a seat besides them. Tracy didn't look at me but at boys who were standing opposite to us. I didn't know what to do next but then Evie said: \"Do you want some pizza?\" I smiled shyly to her and answered: \"Thanks.\" while taking a piece of pizza. \"I'm Evie Zamora.\" \"Yeah, I know. I'm Noel.\" Maybe I had felt wrong about Evie and in real she was a nice person? All of a sudden Evie got up and said: \"Come on, Tracy. We're going to the Park.\" It was the first time, Tracy said something to me: \"Well, Noel, I guess you must not going to the Park. Bye.\" \"You either!\", I responded, but she didn't listen to me. She and Tracy were following the guys who had been skating for a moment. ","Summary":" \"Crap\", I muttered when my book I wanted to put in my bag fell down. Just my luck!

A esa edad un niño debería pensar en cosas como las notas, los amigos, las… las…. Bueno no importa en que mierda tengan que pensar… odio la formalidad así que no voy a darles una intro decente, ni me haga ver una vieja aconsejándole a un mocoso… bueno, voy al punto … \"una tarde perfecta, el sol resplandecía. Era verano. Un clásico día de escuela aburrido. Una pequeña de 5° grado… con sueños, expectativas y preguntas, sobre todo preguntas. Ella era algo petiza, no como esas enanas bajas que parecen ñomos, no. Era petiza, pero no tanto… se llamaba Sabrina y hace unos días se había fijado en un chico un año más grande que ella. No era mucha diferencia, pero aun así sabia que era imposible. Primero por la edad, eran unos enanos de unos 8 años, ¿como podían saber que estaban enamorados?... la verdad no sabían, solo le atraía. No por su físico, en realidad era horrendo, pero había algo en el que le encantaba. Un día ambos salones (5° y 6°, acuérdense que era un año mayor el chico) se juntaron. Los de quinto tenían que ver como trabajaban lo de sexto, ya que en medio año ellos pasarían a un nivel más alto. Los ojos de aquella niña rápidamente se posaron sobre la mirada marciana del pendejo, ambos estaban perplejos uno del otro. Era obvio ambos de atraían. No saben hace cuando, pero cada mirada lo decía todo. Toco la campana del recreo, ambos salieron corriendo, en realidad parecía que todos los chicos del salón competían en un campeonato de velocidades al cual no podían negarse, típico de mocoso de primaria. Sabrina estaba con sus 2 mejores amigas ( ELII15: me olvide el nombre de las amigas, en realidad ni me acuerdo quienes eran las amigas. SABRINA: pense que eras inteligente ¬ ¬# . ELII15: mejame vos! Yo no te digo como escribir tus historias), como de costumbre hablaban de cosas sin sentido, cuando de repente una vos de macho men se dirigió a sabrina (era una vos de gallina desplumada). hola- dijo aquel chico. Hola- respondió Sabrina un poco confundida. Rápidamente sus amigas se levantaron y se fueron para dejarlos solos, sabían que se gustaban mutuamente y no querían molestar, por lo menos no por ahora. Me llamo franco. Ahhh…. ( tu nombre boluda) yoo.. coso.. me llamo Sabri ^-^- aquella sonrisa inicio una \"pequeña\" y tierna historia de amor. Conforme fueron pasando los días, su relación se hizo cada vez mas seria. Pasaban juntos los recreos, hablaban de sus vidas /que mi viejo esto, que mi vieja aquello/, y poco a poco se hacían mas íntimos, hasta llegar al primer beso (no se mucho de lo que paso en realidad, pero vamos a imaginar un poco). Los meses llegaron tan rápido que parecieron días, tenían que crecer, ambos, pero no querían. Es bien sabido de las vacaciones te alejan del colé, de tus amigos y de esa persona especial para Sabrina, pero no serian solo las vacaciones. Secundaria y primaria estaban separados, ya no se verían el los recreos y era muy difícil que se vieran fuera del ámbito escolar. Su \"pequeño\" amor se desvanecía, se iba, se alejaba, se derrumbaba, se calcinaba en su propio jugo, se (SABRINA: deja de escribir cosas estupidas y seguí con el fic!. ELII15: /imitando la voz de Sabrina/ \"no hagas esto, no hagas aquello, no me mates en el fic\".. Son muchas cosas che! Deja que vuele mi imaginación. Loco, no se puede escribir con actrices de segunda) . Ellos ya ni se veían y poco a poco se olvidaron mutuamente. Segundo mes en sexto para Sabrina, y una chica nueva muy distinta a ella. Se llamaba Micaela y era alta… Bueno terminamos con el primer capitulo. Espero sus comentarios! Tengan en cuenta que es mi primer fic en el cual escribo algo que paso en realidad!... Ahhhh y la próxima semana les adelanto una frase de mi libro \"Hermanas\" son frases hechas exclusivamente por mi! Hasta la prox. Semana…. SABRINA: ¿por qué me mete en historias ... Que Hice? ELII15: es que ya no se me ocurría nada…. Que puedo hacer, escarchar a mis compañeros de cole! ^-^… FRANCO: ¿por qué aprovechas todas las oportunidades para insultarme? SABRINA: y por que decis \"pequeña\" relacion? ELII15: emmm…. Por…. Por que… yooo…..miren un ovni! FRANCO Y SABRINA: ehh? ELII15: * escapa a la respuesta *[Chapter 2] \"LA CHICA NUEVA\" Una chica alta, flaca y con disimulados rulos llego al Instituto, se llamaba Micaela, y llamo la atención de todos los presentes, por que media como dos metros. Sabrina no le dio importancia, después de todo era solo una nueva que no tenía ni amigos ni enemigos, no era nada. La primera en darle la bienvenida fue una chica llamada Cecilia, que también era nueva. En realidad venia de la mañana, pero a diferencia de Micaela, Cecilia ya contaba con la amistad de dos pendejitas, que se llamaban Elisa y abi. Micaela no tardo en integrarse al grupo de la más inteligente, la más buena, la más boluda, la más carismática del salón, y su servidora Elisa,….ahhh y abi y CECI también. Las cuatro eran buenas amigas, tenían sus diferencias, pero eran buenas amigas de verdad. Hagamos un árbol de chicos: CECI gustaba de un nene que se llamaba Alan, Mica gustaba del mismo, Sabri le gustaba Franco , pero al no hablarse mas, nunca se supo de otro pendejo gusta, Abi era una pedofila que gustaba de un tal Iván de 4°, Eli no se sabe de quien cornos gustaba. Y así… Conforme fueron pasando los días, Micaela se fue olvidando de Alan y comenzó a gustar de un pibito que se llamaba Ignacio. Todo el tiempo les contaba a sus amigas lo mucho que le gustaba y, que le mandaba cartitas, caritas y esas pelotudeces que ahora no hacemos. CECI también dejo de gustar de Alan y ahora salía con un pibito de secundaria llamado Tomas, Abi quedo forever alone y Eli gustaba de su vecino 5 años mayor que ella. Sabri nunca tuvo una charla amistosa con Micaela, es más, ni siquiera tenia idea de su existencia, y mucho menos se imaginaba lo que pasaría en un tiempo futuro. Pero no adelantemos conclusiones. Este era un grado de pendejos boludos que gustaban unos de otros, otros de otros y algunos de terceros. Pero bueno todos los grados son así… Aun así este grupo era especial, y era dominado por una bestia inmensa, gorda, pelirroja, con rulos y que llevaba un nombre ideal para su persona: Bárbara. Bárbara era la docente titular de este 6°, pero ninguno la soportaba, si siquiera la paciente, comprensiva y cordial Elisa. Todos detestaban a esa seño por que ni siquiera era capaz de pararse y explicar las cosas como se debe… la volvieron loca y la mandaron al siquiatra. En fin, Micaela, la nueva, se habituó a su nueva escuela y poco a poco fue ganado lugar, ya era imposible imaginar 6°b sin ella, se gano su butaca en el teatro y no la dejaría por un buen tiempo. Termino el segundo cap. Se que son cortos pero no tengo mucha imaginación por el momento. Nos vemos! Ahh y puede que deje de escribir en mi otro fic,…. Ya no me atraen como antes los mangas y los amines… :/ SABRINA: se supone que yo soy la protagonista, por que no hable mucho en este capitulo ¿? ELII15: porque ahora Micaela es la protagonista! MICAELA: siiiii ¡! SABRINA: no es justo, ella es la nueva…. Yo tengo mas antigüedad.. ELII15: ¬ ¬…..[Chapter 3] Fin de año de lágrimas: Ya habían pasado 9 meses desde que Micaela vino al Instituto. Como corre el tiempo, ya era el momento de abandonar lo viejo para reinventarse en el estupido mundo de los adolescentes, odio eso, pero me encanta. El acto de fin de año. Los chicos bailaron de presos con algo así como remeras rayadas. Que bobos. Todos actuaron, menos algunos que todavía tenían dignidad. Esto aparte, ya que sexto tenia otro acto más por asimilar. La despedida de primaria, que doloroso. Creo que suponíamos que muy pronto comenzaríamos desde cero. Como niño de jardín que por primera vez ingresa a un salón triste y feo. Cuando mostraron las fotos y los videos que los profes hicieron a los nuevos egresados todos lloraban, no podían creer que sus profesores, las personas que supuestamente tenían que enseñarles lo vital de la existencia, los hubiera escrachado de esa manera. Que hicieron para merecer eso, fotos en las que envés de poner una sonrisa, se tapaban la cara, y otros haciendo sus deberes con el pelo cubriendo su rostro. Que vergonzoso, tenían razón de llorar, esa imagen quedaría por siempre en la memoria traumatizada que aquellos pendejos… luego vinieron los regalos. A todos les dieron una cadenita con su nombre y un diploma. Una baratija inmunda la cadena, que se rompió semanas después. A la poseedora de la bandera nacional le regalaron un cosito feo, que no compensaba todo el esfuerzo y mensualidades que recibía la escuela por parte de casi 2000 chicos. Al final pudieron ser ellos y se divirtieron. Jugaron con espuma, se sacaban fotos lloraban por que algunos se cambiaban de colegio. Como era el caso de Cecilia, y recibió el apoyo de sus incondicionales amigas, sus lagrimas, sus abrazaron y sobre todo su amistad, que quedo inmortal por el momento. Después de toda esa cosa de la graduación. Todos se olvidaron de los que se fueron, pero que podían hacer, tenían sus propias vidas, no podían llorar por quienes ya no están, y mucho menos por personas que también los olvidaron a ellos. Fin de todo. De levantarse tarde, de comer tranquilo en casa, de jugar en los recreos, de correr, de no estudiar en las pruebas y de vivir. Después de las vacaciones, ese grupo tendría que dejar la infancia atrás y convertirse en los hombres y mujeres que ya eran, y por primera vez en sus miserables vidas tendrían que estudiar. Sabrina, después de todo se reencontraría con su viejo amor,… ¿volverían otra vez a ser los antes? La personas que estaban juntos en los recreos y compartían juntos lo poco de vida que habían vivido? Nadie sabia que es lo que pasaba en la cabeza de ambos chicos, pero una cosa era segura… se reencontrarían después de un año de no haberse hablado o siquiera saludado. _ Fin del capitulo! Y el adelanto que les prometí: \"la belleza es un error que se corrige con tiempo. Pero al no tener prisa alguna, el tiempo puede ser muy desesperante. Si no lo corrige, como debería hacerlo, yo me encargare de que el tiempo cumpla con su cometido lo más pronto posible. Después de todo… cuando puedes tener el honor de ocasionar dolor de una forma tan original...\"[Chapter 4] Confusiones: Luego de las cortas vacaciones, comenzaron las clases. Nuevo Prof. Nuevos chicos Nueva silla Nuevo salón Nueva expectativa Nuevas preguntas Nuevo amor?... podría ser. Pero primero, un campazo. Recreo. Cada uno con su propio grupo, su propia gente y sus propios mensajes estupidos traducidos como bromas… Nuevamente Sabrina con sus amigas y un hola inesperado. hola- con esa voz de gallina desp… digo… macho men. Hola- simple y tacita respuesta, ¿estaría enojada por el tiempo que lleva sin hablarle? Chau Sabri!- nuevamente sus amigas se van. Me puedo sentar?- que bobo claro que se puede sentar es un país libre, por que pregunta no? Si, dale sentate. Ahí vengo que me están llamando. En ese momento Sabrina tenía ganas de matarlo. No solo vino e hizo que los dejaran a solas, sino que ni se sentó y se fue el muy bobo. Encima Sabrina se quedo sola, así como forever alone en ese recreo. Muy mal. Micaela estaba hablando con las amigas que le quedaban como de costumbre. Hablaban de cosas como la madrastra de Micaela. Que antes era Marilyn y ahora era Juana. Pobres de Elisa y Abi que tenían que escuchar lo mismo todos los días. Juana siempre me tira indirectas, que haga esto que no haga aquello- en el oído de las chicas eso se escuchaba como un bla bla bla bla… Me tiene harta, encima que se hace la que manda- Pégale- dice Elisa con su estupida vocecita de ñomo resfriado. Jjajaja… naa enserio Eli me tiene harta, quiero que se vaya ya de mi casa. Y decile. No porque si le digo algo a Juana, le dice a mi papa, y el me reta, me entendes. Pégale entonces. ¿Ves que es al pedo hablar con vos Elisa? Bueno che tengo sueño. Que raro de voz- lo dijo en tono sarcastico Timbre. Otra vez arriba a escuchar al profe Manrique, que es bueno pero habla mucho. Pobres chicos. Dia a dia fue pasando el año. Al fnal Eli y Abi se quedaron solas por que Micaela hizo otras amigas ( ELII15: vos siempre cambiando de lado no? MICAELA: yo no soy la que escribe la novela, de que te quejas? ELII15: cállate o te despido como hice con Cecilia! MICAELA: mejor me callo :'( ), esas nuevas amigas se llamaban Nadia y Sabri. Quien se lo iba a imaginar Sabrina y Micaela amigas, después de casi dos años de ser completamente invisible para ambas. ¿Esta amistad resultaría? Fin de otro cap.[Chapter 5] 2° Pasó el año rápidamente y ya comenzaron segundo de secundaria. Eli Eli Eli Eli… te tengo que contar algo- a pesar de no ser tan amigas como antes ellas aun se hablaban como antes. Que pasa? Que me gusta un chico, adivina como se llama?. Emm… Alan. No ese era antes. Emm, coso… Ignacio. No pelotuda esos no… otro. Emmm coso, como se llamaba? Bueno ya fue ¬ ¬# se llama Franco- Elisa ya sabia que la actual mejor amiga de Micaela había tenido un fuerte lazo con ese sujeto, pero decidió no decir nada, ya que si Sabri no dijo nada era por algo, así que solo se decidió a decir… Que tierno… que lindo lo que te pasa, te felicito, y como es? No se. No lo conozco- lo primero que penso Elisa y después lo dijo fue: Haber si entiendo pendeja, te gusta un pibe, que no conoces, ni hablaste con el? Si ^-^!- esa sonrisa ingenua de Micaela se borraría con el paso del tiempo. Que bueno- esas fueron las últimas palabras de Elisa. Con el correr del tiempo y de 2° Micaela y Franco se llevaban cada vez más, hasta el punto que Franco le pidió un beso a Micaela. Que no tenia respeto, era la mejor amiga de su antiguo amor, y por más que pase el tiempo una persona no se puede meter con otra si los sentimientos de una persona amiga están en juego. Pero Micaela también sufría, y decidió no darle el beso. Al recibir respuesta negativa, Franco se fue, como todo lo demás para Micaela y volvió a cercarse a Sabrina. Micaela fue otra vez a contarselo todo a su otra mejor amiga: te digo algo Eli. No. Dale boba que estoy mal. Comprate un perro No, encerio Franco me pidio un beso y yo no se lo di y ahora esta hablando con Sabri!- No te compres un perro que ya tenes un gato. Mal boluda pero decime que hago.? Yo que vos le pego. Naa enserio, le pego a Sabri? No boba a Franco. Igual era lógico por que yo no se si sabias que ellos estaban juntos en primaria. Si que sabia por que Sabri me lo contó, pero me dijo que no pasaba nada mas entre ellos, que quedaron como amigos y fue, aparte Sabri tiene novio. Hay Micaela, tiene novio afuera, pero acá no. Aparte si Franco sigue gustando de ella que se arreglen y que los haga felices a los dos y fue. Vos no entendes no?. Elisa a mi me gusta Franco! Y te felicitamos pero fue. Mejor me voy a hablar con Moira que ella si me entiende Chau ^-^.- Elisa era boba, pero tanto como para no darse cuenta que Franco estaba jugando a varias puntas y tenia que hacer algo para intervenir, o si no, su mejor amiga terminaría con el corazón con augeritos, que podía hacer? Fin del cap. Que pasara en el futuro? Mica si quedara con franco? Sabri se olvidara de que Micaela es su amiga y se ira corriendo a los brazos de franco? Haran un acuerdo como en MI AMOR, MI AMOR y se quedara con las dos? Que es lo que hara elisa para que Mica no salga lastimada? Por que hago todas estas preguntas? Esperen hasta la proxima semana! ^-^ SABRINA: por que tengo que volver con franco¡? ELII15: hay que hacer drama Sabri! MICAELA: siempre vos haciendo que me gusten pibes diferentes por que me odias? ELII15 : no te odio! Solo quiero que sufras un poco…. Necesitamos mas publico! FRANCO: siempre insultando vos, hace algo productivo y deja de jodernos a nosotros! ELII15: despedidos todos ¡! Chau… TODOS: noooooooooooooo….[Chapter 6] (capitulo 6) La loca idea de Elisa! Era viernes. Elisa casi no había dormido por pensar en un plan para separar definitivamente a Franco de Sabri, y hacer que se quedara con Mica y en esto consistía el plan: ¦ PLAN DE ELI! : ¦ ¦ . Separar a Franco de Sabri ¦ ¦ . Acercar a Franco y a Mica ¦ ¦ . Que Franco le aclare a todas las pibitas que lo joden que gusta de Mica ¦ ¦ . Que Franco y Mica sean novios ¦ ¦ . Que Franco y Mica se casen ¦ ¦ . Que le pongan a su primer hija mi nombre! ^-^ ¦ Obviamente el plan de Eli era idiota por que nunca lo iba a poner en marcha, y además no le importaba lo que pasaba con Franco y Mica. De vuelta al cole… Eli le contó lo que pensaba a Abi: - Che boba vos pensas que Franco se decida y por fin este con Mica? - no se- dijo Abi con total desinterés. -bueno mira yo como que estuve pensando y… - ay que raro Elisa pensando- interrumpió Abi con tanta ironía que a Eli le dieron ganas de darle una piña. - boluda no me interrumpas. Bueno, viste, como te decía.. em.. bueno Mica gusta mucho de Franco y como que cada vez que lo ve se quiere comer y todo eso, yo estaba pensando que es mejor que se quede con Mica y no con Sabri. Por que mira, este es el primer amor de Mica, y como que no da que termine rre desilusionada y que se sienta mal por eso, me entesdes?- - como que eso ya lo sabia Elisa- dijo Abi como si lo que pensó fuera lo mas obvio- Pero dale termina. - yo lo que decía era que hay que hacer que Franco se olvide de Sabri y este con Mica. - y como vas a hacer eso si ni siquiera te hablas con Franco como para decirle que este con Micaela? - gracias por tu apoyo Abigail sos rre buena amiga que me da consejos útiles y que no me hecha a perder los planes… gracias… a este paso la madrina del hijo de Mica va a ser Sabri y yo no!... Abigail pendeja de mierda!- dijo Eli totalmente exasperada. - ay… bueno encima que te ayudo me insultas… esta bien no te ayudo mas. - bueno ahora eso no importa. Tenemos que pensar, ver que hacemos con Micaela y con Franco…- dijo finalmente Eli. Las chicas se pusieron a pensar y finalmente después de 10 segundos dijeron esto: - se te ocurrió algo? - No! – dijo Abi. - Bueno entonces ya se… - añadió Elisa triunfante y casi gritando. - Que?- dijo Abi - No hacemos nada! (en ese momento piensen que todos se caen al estilo anime!) - Perfecto- añadió Abigail luego de unos segundos- no hacemos una mierda y que se arreglen los dos…. Los tres dijo… capas que sean 4…. O bueno mejor.. - Son tres y listo, las otras no cuentan. Luego esa charla inútil se fueron haciendo que el plan de Elisa resultara pura basura. Y así nadie hizo nada por Micaela y este capitulo fue al pedo! Bueno espero que los haya divertido y que las protagonistas no se enojen por no haber estado en este capitulo! ^-^ Nos leemos! -_- # SABRINA Y MICAELA: se supone que se trata de nosotras y vos te pones a jugar con los cap….. a bueno!... ELII15: si sis sisiisis…. Bueno Franco no se queja…. Ahhh…. Tienen que firmar mi contrato! FRANCO: que contrato? ELI15, MICAELA Y SABRINA: ahhhhhhhhh! ….. eh? Franco nos asustaste!

It was written to her by her ex-husband, Phineas Mardling, when they were first courting. Phineas really only married her for his own selfish reasons. Had Mr. Pickles not known how evil her ex really was prior to reading the letter though, he might have thought he truly was in love with the woman. The letter was passionate and flattering, yet after analyzing it for hours he could see how manipulative his words really were. Still, Mr. Pickles could not help but be jealous at how well everything flowed on the paper. He felt as if he was holding a secret in his hands. A secret he knew he wasn't supposed to have. He couldn't help but feel guilty over taking it. Before he had the chance to put it back in the small wooden box with the many other letters written to Molly, a thought occurred to him: If he kept the paper in his possession he could use it as a sort of reference for writing his own love letter to Molly. He finally put the paper down after reading over it at least a dozen more times. He set it above a blank piece of paper and a pencil he had ready in front of him on the round wooden table. He was ready to write; he just needed an idea. Mr. Pickles picked up the pencil in his right hand and tapped the eraser on the wood repetitively, hoping his mind would spark something brilliant. Mr. Trout was hanging up some laundry to dry on the line by the stove when he noticed the repetitive sound of the tapping pencil his friend was making. He didn't think much of it, until the tapping got more and more anxious. He looked over at Mr. Pickles, who's face was now contorted in confusion. The large man cleared his throat and Mr. Pickles quickly snapped out of his nervous pattern and clumsily dropping his pencil onto the floor. \"Oh.. Uh, hello.\" Mr. Pickles greeted awkwardly as he retrieved his writing tool. \"Are you alright?\" Mr. Trout asked. He watched Mr. Pickles hit his head on the table as he tried to sit back up. The tall man sighed, as he rubbed his bald head. \"Not really.\" He admitted. He set down his pencil and slumped in his seat. Mr. Trout left his laundry and stood beside his friend. \"Are you writing something?\" He looked at the blank piece of paper, then he thought to himself, Clearly not . \"Well i'm trying, but I guess i'm not very good.\" Mr. Pickles shrugged. Mr. Trout caught sight of the letter sitting on the table and picked it up. \"Did you write this?\" He was impressed as he read on, and he blushed a bit at how personal it became. Then he saw the name at the bottom of the page and thought again, Clearly not . \"AHH! Don't read that!\" Mr. Pickles snatched it out of his companions hands and stuffed it back into his jacket. His friend was shocked by his reaction, and furrowed his brow. \"Did you steal that from Ms. Molly's house?\" the large man questioned. Mr. Pickles fixed his coat and stuttered, \"Wh- What!? N- N- No! Of course not! Wh- Wh- Why would I do such a thing? I have no use for a letter that Molly's e- ex once wrote her. I- I- I- I mean, what would I do with that? Write my own love letter? Pfft!\" There was an awkward moment of silence between the two before Mr. Trout spoke up, \"Did you take it because you're jealous?\" Mr. Pickles huffed again, \"What would I be jealous of? He was a no good man anyway, Ms. Molly told me so.\" He crossed his arms defensively, angry from the accusations that were quite possibly true. Mr. Trout was surprised by this information. He didn't know much about Molly's ex. It wasn't his business to ask. \"Oh, well if he wasn't a good person for her it's probably good that he… You know.\" Mr. Pickles nodded, thinking about how Molly and Phineas were now separated, \"Yes, I suppose it is.\" Mr. Trout was a bit uncomfortable, so he piped up, \"I hate to say that about the dead, but some people have these things coming. Kind of like Mr. Snatcher.\" He couldn't believe he could admit something so awful like that, but it was true. Mr. Snatcher was greedy and selfish, if he had actually gotten what he wanted he would have probably still ended up facing the same gruesome fate. Mr. Pickles paused thinking over what Mr. Trout had just said. He had completely forgotten than he was one of the only few people that knew Molly's husband was still alive. \"Oh, y-y-yes. The dead. He should have redeemed himself, like we did!\" He was referring to both Snatcher and Phineas. He was glad he did the right thing before something bad could have happened to him. Still a bit uncomfortable talking about their former boss, Mr. Trout refocused the conversation. \"Do you need help writing this letter?\" He was a very successful poet, he liked to think. If anyone could use his help it was Mr. Pickles. Unfortunately, Mr. Pickles was determined to do this on his own, whether it turned out a masterpiece or a dud. \"No, no! It has to come from the heart! Also the mind. Don't know if I can listen to my heart and mind at the same time… I'll try my darnedest though!\" He smiled and began writing the first words onto the paper, \"Dear Ms. Molly.\" he read aloud, \"I think i'm starting to get the hang of this writing thing already!\" Although Mr. Trout was unsure of his friends abilities, he could not argue with the heart. He left his best friend to his work whilst he went back to his laundry. \"If you insist. If you need any help i'm still available.\" Mr. Pickles ignored his friends last offer as he tapped the pencil to his chin and thought long and hard about what he needed to say. He thought about Ms. Molly every single day of his life since he met her. Not a day went by she didn't cross his mind. Her beautiful green eyes, her golden locks of hair, her sunny smile, and the warm glow of her cheeks were enough to make any man weak in the knees. They were definitely enough to catch him off hi guard. He thought about all of the wonderful traits about Molly, physical and personality, that made his heart flutter. As hard as he thought about it all though he could not seem to translate it all to the paper. As it turns out, writing was much more complicated than he had originally hoped. He spent hours sitting at that table scribbling out thoughts. Rough draft after rough draft, he just kept cranking out failures. Nothing spoke from the heart the way he needed it to. He concluded that he was more of a man ruled by his brain, and thats what made this so difficult. Nonetheless, he kept pursuing the goal. It was now past dusk and he was about ready to fall asleep at his working station. There were papers crumpled on the floor and sprawled on the table. He gave a heavy yawn as he read over his final product. \"Perfect! Brilliant! Couldn't have said it better myself! Well, I did say it myself actually.\" he stated proudly, his eyes trying hard to keep open. He signed at the bottom, \"love your secret admirer,\" as not to give away his identity in case she didn't care for the letter. With that he set down his pencil, and let his head rest on the table. His brain was fried from all the work; he just fell asleep right at the table. Mr. Trout came upstairs to the factory floor to see his colleague fast asleep. He wasn't surprised, Mr. Pickles barely touched his dinner only an hour before. He approached the table and gazed at the mess his friend had made. He then noticed what he assumed was the final draft in Mr. Pickles right hand. Mr. Trout fiddled his fingers as his curiosity crept. He looked around to make sure no one was spying, then proceeded to gently pry Mr. Pickles fingers from the paper. Once he had it, he read it over. As he read the love note he couldn't help but cringe. It was awful. \"Eyes as green as grass? Hair as yellow as cheese glistening in the sun? Oh my…\" Mr. Trout groaned. He couldn't let him give this to Molly. It would be too humiliating. Seeing the pencil still intact and some extra blank paper, he decided to do a favor for his pal and write up just a quick little, better, love letter. Of course, he was not in love with Ms. Molly, so he had to find a different muse for inspiration. He thought about Ms. Pepper as he wrote this soliloquy. When he described any features Ms. Pepper had he would just simply change them to Ms. Molly's feature. Mr. Pickles was so delusional he would have no idea it wasn't his own hand. It only took a short fifteen minutes for Mr. Trout to write a one page love letter. He read over his work, very pleased with himself, and carefully placed the letter back in his colleague's hand. As soon as the paper touch Monty's skin, his hand got a good grip on it instinctively. Even subconsciously he knew how important this letter was. Mr. Trout sighed, patted his buddy on the back, and went off to bed. ","Summary":" Mr. Pickles couldn't stop reading over the love letter he took from Ms. Molly's house.

She crossed her fingers behind her back hoping it wasn't Mr. Snatcher again, but she had a good feeling about this. The door unlocked and slid open to reveal Mr. Pickles. Her face glowed with a smile as he practically jumped back at the sight of her. \"M-M-Ms. Molly? What are you doing here? And at this time of night? Sh-Shouldn't you be at the party?\" he stuttered. She wondered for a moment how he knew about the Portley-Rind's party, but didn't think to question it. \"I just thought i'd stop by and say hello. I haven't seen you in a while. Well, I mean, besides when you all drive by in the car and we wave to each other. I mean more like actually see each other face to face and talk. May I come in?\" she asked politely. Mr. Pickles quickly opened the door fully and moved to the side so she could step in, \"Oh of course! Come in, please!\" Everything in the Red Hat Handbook suddenly flew out of his mind as he let this woman into the factory. No one was allowed in that Mr. Snatcher didn't know about. Red Hats only was the usual policy. Molly walked around the open, dirty, space and caught sight of Mr. Trout and Mr. Gristle sitting at a round wooden table nearby. \"Oh! Hello there men! How are you?\" Mr. Trout was flabbergasted to see her in the factory, he knew as well as any of his colleagues the strict rules that Snatcher enforced. He was mostly amazed that Mr. Pickles of all of them had forgotten; he was the most knowledgable of all the Red Hat rules. They all knew the punishment they could face if they were caught. \"Um… How do you do, Ms. Monte Cristo.\" Molly searched with her eyes around the rest of the room, \"Is it only you three? Mr. Snatcher doesn't appear to be here.\" she noticed. Mr. Pickles stood right beside her, \"He's out at a par-\" Mr. Gristle whacked him on the arm and gave him a scowl as not to blow their bosses cover. \"I- I mean he's out.\" The tall man winced and rubbed his arm where the short man had hit. The blonde couldn't help but sigh of relief at this news. Snatcher gave her the creeps, and she much preferred the company of the other Red Hats over his. \"Well, no matter! Your company is enough.\" The compliment was directed at all of them, but she looked at Mr. Pickles in particular when she said it. Mr. Pickles gulped and smiled nervously, showing his crooked teeth. Mr. Trout was not one to push guests out, but the boss could be home any moment, and he did not want to get anyone in trouble. \"It was very nice of you to stop by, Ms. Monte Cristo, but perhaps you should be getting home. It's awful late and all-\" \"Nonsense Mr. Trout!\" Mr. Pickles waved it off, \"We Red Hats are gentlemen and welcome everyone into our home!\" He placed his arms behind his back and rocked slightly on his heels, \"Especially a pretty lady such as Ms. Molly.\" He looked down a bit embarrassed that he could say something so flattering. Molly's face grew pink and her eyes glistened. She quickly pulled her fan out from her breast and began waving it in front of her face in a flirtatious and shy manner. Mr. Pickles turned pink as well after seeing that. \"Hehehe, nice.\" Mr. Gristle chuckled from his seat at the table. Mr. Trout didn't want to beat around the bush anymore, \"Mr. Pickles, might I have a word with you please?\" The tall man was in a daze still looking at the lady. Trout tapped on his shoulder, and Mr. Pickles focus was regained. \"Oh… Alright then, if you'll excuse me miss.\" He tipped his hat to Molly and she put her fan away as he did so. He looked the other way quickly as not to see where she was putting it. Trout and Pickles talked in the corner on the other side of the table. \"Mr. Trout this better be very important. This never usually works, but for some reason now it is. Maybe she had a drink or two.\" \"I think you're being a little too nonchalant about this, Mr. Pickles. If the boss comes back in his current getup and Ms. Molly see's him, we could all be done for.\" He paused for a moment, and looked back at the woman who was now at the Leech tank with Mr. Gristle. \"This is Samantha, and Gregory, and Jamie, and Klaus…\" he listed off the names of all his leeches to her. She looked at them with fascination. \"Oh! I think Klaus just smiled at me!\" she waved to the small creature in the tank that sucked on the glass with it's sharp, tiny, teeth. Mr. Trout rethought his arguments, \"Then again, she is rather… Ditzy. Perhaps she won't even notice. Snatcher will notice though, and I don't won't to be there when he does.\" Mr. Pickles put a hand on his friend's back reassuringly, \"Don't worry, Mr. Trout. I've got this all under control. She'll be out of here before the boss gets back.\" Molly tapped Mr. Pickles shoulder, and both men turned to look at her. \"I don't mean to interrupt, but I just had a wonderful thought! How about you show me the car!\" \"The car?\" both men said in unison, giving each other worried glances. She nodded. \"Oh yes, i've always wanted to see it up close. If it's no trouble?\" she asked hopefully. She had a feeling that being there was against their policies, and she didn't want anyone to get in trouble. Perhaps if they went outside it would be better at least. Mr. Pickles rubbed the back of his neck, reconsidering what he had told his large colleague before. \"Um, hehe, sure! I'll show you the car! It's right this way!\" he gestured out the door and she went. Before stepping out behind her, he looked back at both the other Red Hats, giving them a nod as if to say, \"I totally got this!\" Whether he did or not, he wasn't so certain, but any time spent with Ms. Molly was worth the punishment Mr. Snatcher put on him. Outside on the other side of the factory was where the car was parked. Molly couldn't help but remember the first night she and Mr. Pickles met as they walked together under the night sky. She looked at him, and he smiled at her as they made their way around the building. At the sight of the car, Molly oohed and ahhed. \"Oh my, I have never seen it this close before. It's so… Mechanical!\" She walked around it, Mr. Pickles following her. \"Yes, well it is a mechanical thing.\" He mentally slapped himself for saying something so stupid. Luckily she didn't really catch it. She ran around to the other side of the car, \"This is where you stand! Right?\" She was practically bouncing with excitement as he made his way around. \"Ah, yes. That's my spot.\" She tried to find a way on, but it seemed very complicated. She had no clue where to hold on or where to place her feet. \"May I?\" she asked, perhaps then he could show her. Mr. Pickles looked at her then the car, then back to her. \"Well, if you want. Here,\" he hesitantly placed his hands around her waist and helped her up. She found her grip and held on for dear life. Mr. Pickles couldn't believe he just touched the woman of his dreams, especially her waist. He let go as soon as she was up. \"A-Are you ok?\" \"Oh my this is quite a lot of work to hang on here!\" she carefully adjusted herself while trying to keep from slipping. The gangly man kept a careful eye on her in case she fell. \"It's nothing really. It's all about finding your balance and having a good grip.\" She turned so she could face him, while still having the best grip she could on the car. \"You must have very strong hands then.\" she complimented. Mr. Pickles looked down at his bandaged fingers, \"Um, no not really.\" When he looked back up at Ms. Molly, he was closer than he realized. Her eyes had a twinkle in them as she smiled. He smiled back genuinely, although his guts were turning inside of him, he couldn't look away from her. \"How do I get down?\" she asked. Mr. Pickles, with less hesitation than before, placed his hands back around her waist and helped her down onto the ground. When she landed his hands lingered, and Molly giggled upon realizing just how long they were on her. Mr. Pickles pulled his hands away in embarrassment, and was now much further from her than he was before. \"I'm terribly sorry, Miss.\" He kept his hands to himself in a very modest fashion. Moly pulled out her fan and began her flirtatious act again. \"Oh it's fine really!\" she insisted as she took a step toward him. He immediately stepped back as if he were afraid of her advances. \"No, no, I mean… As a gentlemen, and your friend, I really shouldn't.\" At this Molly froze. He said the 'F' word. The dreaded 'F' word. All of this happening and he still only considered them friends. \"Friend. Yes, of course. How foolish of me.\" she put her fan away and looked down at the dirt. A silence fell between them. Mr. Pickles was about to speak, but Molly beat him to it, \"And you are my friend too. My very dear friend.\" Mr. Pickles heart was no longer beating fast, and the feelings in his gut were replaced with sour ones instead. He sighed, \"Right. Friend.\" \"I best be on my way home now. Thank you for showing me the car. I enjoyed our time together.\" she didn't look up at him. She bid her farewell, and started up the hill. \"I enjoyed our time as well.\" He said before losing sight of her. He wasn't surprised she couldn't hear him though. After a moment of waiting in the dark in regret, he went back inside to see his fellow Red Hats. As Molly trudged up the hill, she felt a tear roll down her cheek. She wiped it quickly so no one could see. Not that anyone was around, it was past curfew and everyone was either asleep or at Portley-Rind's party. Just a bit farther up the hill and Molly could hear footsteps coming down. As they came closer she heard some angry low grumbling with them. It sounded a lot like Mr. Snatcher. Molly was in no mood to see him, but as she approached the noise, it turned out to be Madame Frou-Frou. Molly was delighted and bewildered to see her. \"Ah! Ms. Frou-Frou! What are you doing this far downtown?\" Frou-Frou froze in disbelief as she regained her composure. \"I could ask you ze same thing, my darling.\" Molly's smile fell as she began to explain, \"Well I took your advice and went to go see Mr. Pickles.\" Frou-Frou's eye twitched. \"You mean you were at the factory?\" The blonde nodded and continued to explain. \"But it didn't work out. He called me… His…. HIS… FRIEND!\" The tall woman's face did not change. She didn't quite understand the situation. \"Friend? Well zat means you are halfway sere, right?\" She continued to walk down the hill as they talked, hoping she could lose the ditz along the way. Molly went on with her drama though, \"NO! That's the opposite of what i'm going for!\" The redhead rolled her eyes, she did not have any time for this nonsense. She needed to lose her. \"Well i'm terribly sorry to hear that, but I must be off! I have business to attend to.\" She picked up speed as she went down the hill. Molly stopped in her tracks, feeling like a rude tagalong. \"Oh, alright. Sorry to bother you. Goodnight, Madame!\" Frou-Frou did not reply back to the lady. Under all that getup, Snatcher was starting to boil over in anger. As soon as he reached the factory, he threw the door open. His men were sitting at the table, Mr. Pickles looking rather down. They all sat up as soon as they caught sight of their boss. \"Good evening sir! How was the party?\" Trout greeted, as if nothing had happened while he was away. Snatcher rolled his eyes for the billionth time that night as he approached the table. \"Oh you don't want to hear about my night do you?\" he played, \"I'd much rather heat what you men did while I was away. That is, if anything happened?\" Mr. Gristle looked up at Trout and Pickles with an evil smile, as if he was in on Snatcher's game. The other two Red Hats nervously began to cover up their evening. \"Why no! Nothing ever happens here, right Mr. Pickles?\" The large man looked to his friend, who was shaking like a leaf. Trout could see Snatcher's patience weathering, as well as his eyeshadow. He gave Mr. Pickles a soft nudge and repeated himself, \"Right?\" Pickles broke immediately, \"Molly was here.\" he spouted quickly. Mr. Trout threw his hands in the air and then covered his face. Mr. Gristle chuckled, \"Busted.\" Mr. Trout uncovered his face and called the short man out, \"Oh come on, you were there too!\" \"Enough!\" Archibald slammed his manicured fists on the table. He directed the rest of his yelling at Mr. Pickles in particular, because clearly this was all on him. \"How many times I gotta tell you that women are nothing but trouble?! Especially that one?\" He pointed out the door to where Molly once was. Pickles looked down in humiliation, \"I- I just thought…\" \"Thought what?\" Snatcher interrupted, \"That maybe she'd see you as something more? A lady like that will only ever look at you as a commoner. Maybe a friend if you're lucky.\" He then began to make his way to the stairs. Mr. Pickles watched as his boss walked away, and piped up. \"Well, friend means i'm halfway there, right?\" As Snatcher swung around the railing he gave his stooge an evil glare. \"NO!\" ","Summary":" Molly knocked ten times on the factory doors, and rocked back and forth on her heels as she waited."},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Winnie's Horrible Life","Author":"Pinkarray","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11250887","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I got on stage and yelled, \"Winnie is not a likeable person; she pampers my brother, Eggs.

Lord and Lady Portley-rind were trying to stop the crowd from causing any more mayhem but they just ran over them. \"Mommy! DADDY!\" yelled Winnie, shrieking. \"Wait, wait!

After a trip up to the old attic, she found something she had never wanted to see again. A compilation of all her ex-husband's old love letters he had written for her when they had first met. She made the mistake of reading them and was now in a terrible state of grief. She usually wasn't like this, she was usually the type of person to shrug things off and never hold a grudge, but what happened between her husband and her was so heartbreaking that she couldn't help but mourn their relationship. She remembered it all in an instant. A trip to a town known as Mira for a family funeral resulted in their meeting. Phineas Mardling was his name. He was a short man with slicked back black hair and a mustache to match. He was obviously from an upperclass home, judging by the fancy clothes he wore. He was a charming fellow, and being the hopeless, flirty, romantic she was, Molly fell for every trick he played. It started with simple things like hand kisses and kind compliments, and quickly escalated into love letters and a marriage proposal. She thought that was what she wanted, she thought she would be happy, but only a week after their wedding things starting becoming odd. He was barely around, and when he was he wasn't the same man she knew him to be. Her only company anymore was the maid, Millicent. While she was wonderful company and a great housekeeper, she was also old and couldn't hear very well. Molly made do with the life she had, and was ready to stick by the man she loved, even if he was never home. Two painful years later, he arrived home with a mystery woman and told Molly she was old hat and needed to leave immediately. She put up a fight of course, but it was pointless. She finally saw him for the greedy, sexist, pig he was. She bid her goodbye to Millicent and went on her way back to Cheesebridge. Upon arriving, she explained all the agonizing nights and days to her father who simply nodded and held his bearded chin in his hands while he listened. Ernest only wanted what was best for Molly, and right away he knew that if she wanted to get back on her feet in a town like Cheesebridge, she couldn't tell anyone what had really happened between her and Phineas. Together they made up the lie that Phineas died in a fire and having nowhere else to go, Molly was forced to move back to the town she grew up in and live with her father. It was a simple lie, and no evidence proved her wrong. Keeping the lie alive was easy. No one questioned it, they simply pitied with the poor woman. Deep down she felt very guilty about it though. She felt the most guilty when she was lying to Mr. Pickles though. She loved him more than words could say, and for six years now she had kept the charade going, but she wasn't sure how long she would last. What if he eventually confessed his feelings to her? What if they got married? She would have to tell him eventually. She couldn't take that kind of lie to the grave with her, it just wasn't something she could or would do. As she lied on her bed, she heard a knock on her door. \"Molly, dear? You in there?\" her father asked from behind the door. She sighed, \"Yes, i'm here father.\" she got up, and fixed her dress and hair a tad. \"That Pickle boy is here for your weekly tea.\" he informed her. Molly's head perked up immediately at the mention of Mr. Pickles. Amidst all her sulking she forgot about Tuesday Tea! She quickly finished fixing herself up and ran out the door right past her father. She flew down the stairs and into the living room where Mr. Pickles was waiting on the chaise lounge. He stood up at the sight of her and greeted, \"Oh, hello Ms.-\" \"I'm so sorry i'm late! How am I late in my own house? I don't usually forget about Tuesday Tea, but i've been having sort of a rough day and- Oh my goodness I didn't even make any tea! I'll be right back!\" the words left her mouth faster than her brain could process them. She then flew right to the kitchen and put a kettle on the stove for tea. She began to run back out to the living room, but halfway there she bumped into Mr. Pickles. They both shrieked as they ran into each other. \"Ms. Molly are you alright?\" he asked with concern, \"You act as if you've seen a ghost.\" The lady turned dramatically, placing the back of her hand to her forehead. \"Only a ghost of my past!\" Mr. Pickles paused as he waited for her to go on, but she didn't. \"Um… Alright then.\" He placed a hand on her back, \"Perhaps we should sit down.\" The kettle whistled, and Molly began pushing Mr. Pickles back into the living room. \"Not without tea! It's Tuesday Tea after all! You go sit and i'll be right back!\" She ran back towards the kitchen and carefully poured the hot water into a teapot. She then placed the pot on a tray with matching spoons, cups, and saucers and marched it out to where her close friend was sitting. As she placed the tray on the coffee table, Mr. Pickles couldn't help but pipe up again, \"Ms. Molly, forgive me for saying so, but you're acting a little… Squirrely.\" The quicker she got the more worried he became. \"You mentioned earlier you were having a rough day…\" he trailed off, hoping she would explain. At the mention of her day, she locked eyes with the tea tray and shakily poured each of them a cup. Her movements were still sped up, but her words started to slow. \"I- I don't recall saying that.\" she stuttered nervously, still not daring to look at him. He tilted his head trying to make eye contact, but she continued to avoid it. He brought his head back up, \"That's what I thought you said anyway. I mean you were talkin so fast I might have just heard you wrong.\" Molly gave an internal sigh of relief as he seemed to let it go. \"Then again,\" he started up, \"what did you mean when you said you saw a ghost of your past? I know I heard that one right, you weren't talking as fast that time.\" Molly felt herself panicking, her corset felt tighter as her breathing became more shallow. Hoping he couldn't notice, she lifted her cup of tea to her lips to sip, but she was still shaking and the tea was spilling out of the cup quite a bit. Mr. Pickles took the cup out of her hand and placed it back on the tray. \"You can tell me, Molly. I don't like seein you like this, it's not like you.\" He took her hands in his. He usually wasn't this brave enough to get so personal, but for Molly's sake he would do anything. The lady stopped shaking as he took her hand. She looked him in the eyes for the first time since he arrived at her house and he smiled at her. Her face flushed, and she used one hand to fan herself. \"I think I need to lie down.\" Mr. Pickles was about to get up and prop up a pillow for her to lay on, but before he could, she kicked her feet up and onto his lap, laying her head on the pillows closer to her. He was startled by the action, and his cheeks turned a bit pink, but he didn't draw too much attention to it. \"I-Is everything alright?\" he asked once more, hoping this time she would actually start explaining. Molly sighed, and left a moment of silence to think about what she wanted to say next. Perhaps now was a good time to let the cat out of the bag. \"Can you keep a secret, Mr. Pickles?\" she asked hopefully. \"I- I suppose. I mean I kept Mr. Snatcher's secret for about ten years, so I guess I could do it again.\" he shrugged. Molly took a deep breath before getting into the topic. How she would even begin to explain was beyond her. She worried that if she confessed he would think she was some kind of liar. She had a pure soul though, she could not tell a lie or keep a secret for too long. She was bound to crack eventually, so why not now? \"What if I was to tell you that I… I am not a widow.\" she began softly, \"That my husband actually didn't die in a fire.\" she averted her gaze from the ceiling over to her friend. He looked a bit shaken, in fact she could feel him almost shaking under her legs. She took one more deep breath before finally confessing, \"He kicked me out of the house and left me for another woman.\" she closed her eyes tightly, waiting for some kind of reaction from Mr. Pickles. He let out a sigh of air, \"Oh thank goodness.\" he said quickly. Molly's eyes popped open and she raised an eyebrow at him. \"I thought you were gonna say you killed your husband.\" At this, the lady shot up on the couch and was back to sitting upright beside him. \"WHAT?! Where would you get an idea like that?\" she placed her hands on her hips. Mr. Pickles hunched his shoulders, feeling a bit rude for what he blurted out. \"Hamilton.\" he admitted shyly. Molly's arms crossed and swung her legs back to the ground so she could sit upright. She turned away from the tall man. \"Hamilton, pfft!\" she rolled her eyes. \"Hamilton doesn't know a thing about this whole mess, he's just a gossip!\" The Red Hat's shoulders fell and he apologized, \"Sorry…\" he reverted back to the subject, \"Why are you upset about your husband all a sudden?\" a realization dawned on him, and he gulped before asking, \"A- Are you still in love with him?\" Molly shuttered at the thought, \"NO! After what he did to me? I can't love a man like that. I was just in the attic and I found some old things that made me think of him.\" She picked up her tea, now a bit cooled down, and sipped what was left in the cup. \"Like what?\" he asked curiously. Molly paused before answering, she was a bit embarrassed that she even kept those love letters around. \"Just… Love letters from when we were young.\" Mr. Pickles froze. The man that once won Ms. Molly's heart wrote her love letters? Is that what he should be doing? How do you even write a love letter? Ms. Molly picked up again, \"Really though, I shouldn't even have them, I hate looking at them. I should burn them in fact.\" After saying the thought out loud, she froze. \"Yes… Yes, that- that's not a bad idea at all!\" She quickly but gently set down her cup on the tea tray and marched upstairs to her room. She grabbed the letters out of the small wooden box on her vanity and marched straight back downstairs. She set down the box on the coffee table and got on her knees in front of the fire place across from the chaise lounge so she could light it. As she did so, Mr. Pickles curiosity was getting the better of him. He carefully and quietly opened the small box and pulled out one envelope. He pulled out the first letter, which was written on paper that felt like an autumn leaf; It was very fragile and felt like it could easily tear or crunch. He read it to himself, surprised at how brilliant the writing was. Some parts made him roll his eyes, jealous he couldn't write that good. Other parts made him freeze, he couldn't believe how passionate and intimate this man was with Molly. He knew he could never write such things for her, and he shrunk in his seat as he finished the letter, signed \"eternally and gratefully yours, Phineas.\" Molly stood up and brushed the cinders from her hands. Mr. Pickles noticed and quickly shoved the letter back into its envelope. He was about to put it back in the box, but paused for a split second before shoving it into his jacket. The lady turned around and smiled at him, he smiled back feeling a bit guilty. She picked up the box and individually threw each one into the fresh flames. \"Here is to leaving the past behind us and to someday, hopefully, finding new love.\" She tossed the box onto the chair and placed her hands on her hips, pleased with what she did. Mr. Pickles stood up and moved to Molly's side, watching the paper crumple into ash. Suddenly he felt two arms wrap around him and a curly mess of hair hitting him in the face. He instinctively raised his arms, shocked by the action. \"Thank you.\" she said as she nuzzled her head into his shoulder. Mr. Pickles' arms lowered and hugged her back. \"Oh, you're welcome… What for?\" She shrugged. \"I don't know. You're the first person i've confessed to though, besides my father.\" she paused. \"I suppose I'm thanking you for not judging me. You're not judging me, are you?\" \"No! No, of course not. I would never judge you. What's to judge? I should only judge your ex-husband for being such a brute. Pardon my language…\" he hugged her a little tighter, as if he never wanted to let go. She giggled in his arms. \"Not at all, he is a brute.\" There hug lasted only a moment more, before Molly backed off. \"Now how about some tea?\" He nodded in agreement. They had much to discuss this Tuesday. ","Summary":" Molly laid on her bed, sulking.

He usually would stand to the side and watch the people talk amongst themselves and have a good time. He was never more than a shadow at these sort of events, but today he was actually standing in the Portley-Rind's house, in the middle of a crowd laughing and conversing with all the other guests as if he was the most popular man in town. On the contrary, he was the most woman in town. His usual greased up hair was covered by a tall, red, wig. His face that usually had an evil scowl spread across it now had lipstick and rouge in it's place. He even had on a floor-lengthed blue dress and tights to complete the look. No one knew it was him under the disguise. Here he was Madame Frou-Frou; the most popular woman in Cheesebridge, and the most attractive to all the men. His persona took over easily as people asked him about his life and his success as a performer. Making up a fake background was actually a bit fun, mostly because the people actually bought into it all. He couldn't believe how blind these aristocrats were, especially the men. Practically all the men in Cheesebridge, especially the White Hats, were putty in his hands when he was Madame Frou-Frou. This was usually a benefit to his evil schemes, but there was a downside. He had learned very quickly that men, those of the upperclass in particular, do not know how to keep their hands to themselves. This just made his respect for them fall even lower than it already had been. Still, the tight dresses, itchy wigs, and excessive groping was worth it if it meant he got his White Hat in the end. A White Hat was all he ever wanted, ever since he was a child. He watched as his father worked day in and day out, slaving for those rich bafoons, and what did he ever get? Nothing! Snatcher knew that was not the life for him though, he wanted to be somebody. He wanted to do what his father and his grandfather couldn't' do. He was going to be a great man, he could feel it in his bones. \"If you'll excuse me, I need to use ze ladies room.\" he excused himself in his crackerslavachian accent. The ladies and gentlemen all nodded understandably and went about their business. Snatcher made his way to the laboratory, but not to actually use it. He locked the door and looked in the mirror. An evil smirk crossed his face, he resisted the urge to give out an evil laugh. His plan was in full swing, it couldn't get better than this. Soon he would be in with the White Hats and have one all his own, he just had to be a bit more patient. He was almost there. Looking in the mirror, he fixed his pantyhose, they were always being a problem. \"How do women deal with this nonsense?!\" he mumbled to himself. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. \"Yoo hoo!\" a shrill voice called through the door. \"Whoever is in there, I would like to ask that you hurry it up! You are taking a very long time and people are waiting!\" Snatcher couldn't help but growl and the impatient women on the other side of the door. He quickly composed himself and then opened the door. \"So sorry, my darling, you know how it is being a lady. We have to look our best!\" He stopped as he caught sight of the woman in front of him. It was that annoying Monte Cristo woman Mr. Pickles wouldn't shut up about. He contained his groans and kept up his persona as best as he could. Molly gasped, \"Oh, Madame! I'm so sorry I didn't know it was you in there. I thought it was Miss Petting again. She takes ages in there, you know.\" Snatcher nodded, although he had no idea who she was talking about. \"But of course, it was a little misunderstanding, but it is alright! Now I must be off!\" he began to make his way back to the party, but Molly stopped him. \"Wait! Madame, if you don't mind me asking… I have a question. You are by far the most known woman in town, and everyone loves you. How do you do it? How do you get those men so flustered over you?\" Molly was desperate for advice. She thought she knew how to catch a man, but the man she was after was a tough one to lasso. Having no success with Mr. Pickles, she needed to know what men found so appealing in her so that she could try it herself perhaps, and finally win Mr. Pickles' heart. Snatcher did not have time for these games, he didn't want to help her. Besides, why did she need help? She was pretty enough, not his type personally, but nonetheless pretty to the average standard. \"Oh, sweetheart, why do you need my advice, you are already lovely on your own!\" she continued to walk as she flattered Ms. Molly. The blonde blocked Frou-Frou's path as she tried to get information out of her some more. \"That is very kind of you Madame, but you see there is a specific man i'm after and no matter how hard I try nothing seems to work! I just figured since you are the master at these things, perhaps you could give me some insight.\" She smiled hopefully, her hands together as if she were begging. \"And who exactly is zis man you are after?\" He placed one hand on his hip, annoyed at her pestering. Molly's smile disappeared as she tried to figured out how to explain her dream man. \"Well, he's a Red Hat. Very tall, dark, and handsome! The bravest man in Cheesebridge, and he has stolen my heart away!\" That description made Snatcher stop and almost drop his act. By that description she had to be talking about him, who else was tall, dark, and handsome? Everyone already knew that Archibald was the bravest man in Cheesebridge, what with his heroic deeds capturing Boxtrolls every night for the past few years. He wasn't surprised at all if she was talking about him, he was rather irresistible. He smiled down at her, \"Well, dear. If zis man has had such an impact on you, perhaps the best thing to do is tell him how you feel.\" Molly shook her head ferociously, \"Oh no, no, no! I can't do that! Every time I talk to him I get rather… Well, I clam up a bit. Then when I don't clam up and I want to say something he turns it around.\" Snatcher couldn't recall a situation like that ever happening, but went along with it anyway. \"Well, i'm sure the great Archibald Snatcher is just unaware of your affections, you need to just be forward with him!\" Molly paused for a moment, then broke out into hysterics. \"What's so funny?\" His accent dropped as she continued to laugh. \"I'm not in love with Mr. Snatcher!\" she said between giggles, \"I like Mr. Pickles!\" \"WHAT?\" he raised his voice, accent now gone. He quickly caught himself though and tried again, \"VHAT?! My darling what kind of man is Mr. Pickles? Especially compared to that… HUNK Archibald Snatcher, hmm?\" Molly's giggle fest was over and she thought about what Frou-Frou was saying, \"Well, he definitely is the third most attractive of the Red Hats.\" she tapped her chin as she thought about it more. Snatcher couldn't believe this, \"THIRD?! Who is ze second?!\" Molly smiled, \"Why, Mr. Gristle of course!\" she answered without hesitation. Snatcher's face and shoulders fell as he listened to these nitwit opinions. \"Are you kidding me?\" he muttered to himself. Molly could see the disappointment on Frou-Frou' face. \"But that doesn't mean Mr. Snatcher isn't handsome. I just like short men a bit. You know my ex husband was only about a foot taller than Mr. Gristle.\" Snatcher's face contorted, \"You have an ex husband?\" This woman was insane. Molly ignored his question and moved past it, \"Archie has his good point too, like for instance he has beautiful hair, and he's got that mystery to him, it's exciting to say the least. But all in all, Mr. Pickles is the real man for me. He's tall, handsome, brave, charming, and best of all…\" she paused to fantasize for a moment, \"Those legs!\" That was it, the final straw. \"Well, it was nice talking to you Ms. Monte Cristo, but I better be on my way. Can't keep my public waiting!\" he quickly made his way down the hall and back to the party, but she was on his heels. \"Oh, but wait! Madame! What about your advice? What should I do to win Mr. Pickles heart?\" she trailed behind him waiting for an adequate answer. Snatcher couldn't take much more of this, he stopped and turned back to her sharply. \"Here is some advice! If you like him so much, why don't you go bother HIM and not ME!\" With another sharp turn she went back out to the party, leaving Molly in the dust.

It was as if happiness was prickled like pixie dust over everyone, and things couldn't be better. This was evident in just about everyone in Cheesebridge. Lord Portley-Rind was more caring for his daughter and took his responsibilities as mayor more seriously, Herbert Trubshaw was back to inventing whacky machines, and all the Boxtrolls were no longer afraid of the world above their cavern. One person this change became evident in was Mr. Pickles, one of Archibald Snatcher's loyal henchmen. After he redeemed himself and officially became a good guy, his confidence was at a new high. He felt that he was finally ready to step up and do something he thought he could never do. He was going to ask Ms. Molly Monte Cristo on a date. The walk from the Red Hat factory up to her house on Milk Street started out simple enough, but as he got closer and closer to her house he began to regret the decision. Something inside him kept his feet moving forward though, and once he reached her front door he had to take a moment. Staring at the door, he took a deep breath and held it as he knocked on the door with his bandaged knuckles. Still holding his breath, he waited. A lock unhinged and the door swung open, but instead of the tall blonde he expected, there was short old man with a long beard in a top hat and trench coat. \"May I help you?\" he asked, eyeing the odd, tall man on his doorstep. Mr. Pickles finally released his breath and cleared his throat as he removed his hat, \"Good day, I-I'm here to see Ms. Monte Cristo. Is she home?\" He couldn't help but fiddle with his hat as he awaited an answer. The man gave a sly smile. \"Maybe she is, maybe she isn't… Who's asking?\" He crossed his arms with a playful look across his face. \"… Um, Mr. Pickles is asking.\" the tall man answered sheepishly. The short man's eyes shot open, he knew who he was! \"Ah, you're that tall fellow Molly won't stop talking about!\" he grabbed Mr. Pickles hand and shook it almost wildly, \"Pleasure to meet ya, boy. I'm her father, Ernest Monte Cristo!\" Mr. Pickles' arm flailed as Ernest shook it. It almost made him lose his balance. As soon as the grip was released he went back to fiddling with his hat. \"N-Nice to meet you, sir. So is Ms. monte Cristo-\" \"Oh, she's here alright! In fact she just sat down for tea, why don't you come in and join her!\" Mr. Monte Cristo pulled Mr. Pickles into his house enthusiastically. Any friend of his daughters was a friend of his. Although, he wasn't as handsome and bold as Molly had stated before, but she was quite the storyteller, so her father just shrugged it off. As soon as he was inside, Mr. Pickles knew there was no turning back. He looked around the house, it was much bigger than it looked from the outside. Mr. Monte Cristo led him to the living room where Molly sat on a chaise lounge couch sipping tea. \"Molly dear, you've got a visitor!\" Ernest announced proudly. The girl turned and beamed at the sight of the tall Red Hat. \"Oh, it's you! Please sit! I just made some tea, would you care for a cup?\" she stood up and grabbed his hand, guiding him to the couch as she spoke quickly. It seemed like he couldn't respond fast enough, before he knew it he had a cup of tea in his hands and he hadn't even said hello. \"Now, what brings you here, Mr. Pickles?\" she asked, this time waiting for an answer. She gazed at him intently as he took a moment to compose himself. He loosened his scarf and cleared his throat again before speaking, \"I just… wanted to come by to… say hello, how are you? I mean, I- I haven't seen you in a while, and there's been so much change in town lately, I just thought that it would be nice to… to see you again.\" He smiled to hide his humility. Molly's face continued to beam with excitement. She couldn't believe he was here, in her house, without invitation. She thought it was a one in a million chance he would actually show interest in her. Who knew she'd be that one? If he came to visit her then that's surely what it meant, that he really truly liked her. He said so himself that he thought it would be nice to see her again. Her heart fluttered and he couldn't help but bet her eyes a bit just thinking about it. \"That's… That's very kind of you.\" was all she could mutter out. \"Why I was just beginning to wonder myself what you were up to and when i'd see you again.\" Mr. Pickles perked up, \"You- You did?\" his smile became more genuine as he too felt his heart give a small flutter. Molly nodded and looked down at her feet bashfully. Mr. Pickles felt ready to say something, but then he felt something soft brush his leg. He gave a small shriek and dropped his tea. A white furball jumped into the air and shrieked too, then proceeded to run under the couch. \"What was that?!\" he asked, lifting his feet as if there were a rodent crawling on the floor. \"Oh my! It's alright, that's just my cat!\" Molly quickly set down her cup of tea and got on her hands and knees on the floor, searching for her cat. \"Sibella, come here pretty kitty.\" She pulled the cat out and sat back on the couch, a fat, white, fluff of fur now on her lap. She had a few trickles of tea on her fur, and glared at Mr. Pickles vengefully. \"Oh, hehe, hello pretty kitty.\" he hesitantly reached to pet the cat but it hissed at him hatefully. He jumped back in his seat, but Molly held the animal back. \"Sibella! That is no way to treat our guest. Especially Mr. Pickles, he's a very special guest you know.\" as she talked to the cat her voice progressed into baby talk. Mr. Pickles caught what she said, \"I- I am?\" \"Of course you are!\" she said without any hesitation or humility. She let the cat down and it ran around the corner out of sight. \"Anyway, where were we?\" \"We're in your living room.\" he answered the question literally. At this, Molly burst out laughing. It was rather unladylike but she couldn't help it. Even Mr. Pickles was surprised by her reaction. He watched her as she laughed for a good five minutes, she looked cute when she laughed. She was hunched over, trying to catch her breath, but whenever she did she just went into another fit of giggles. Finally she eased out of it and was calm. \"A- Are you done?\" he asked seriously. She cleared her throat, a big smile still on her now pink face. \"Yes. Sorry.\" \"Oh, it's alright. Was I really that funny though?\" he asked. No one ever laughed at his jokes before. What he said wasn't a joke necessarily, but he had never made anyone laugh that hard before. Molly had to contain herself from giggling some more. \"Oh it was hilarious! I hope i'm not being rude though… I just can't help it!\" \"No, no! It's fine, I- I like seeing you laugh.\" the words slipped out before he even processed them. Molly's big green eyes suddenly got bigger and full of stars. \"You- You like my laugh?\" Mr. Pickles gulped and nodded, embarrassed he had said something so bold. \"That's so nice of you, thank you.\" she smiled, her eyes still as bright as the moon. \"You're very welcome.\" he smiled.

It had been a few days since the one red hat, Mr. Pickles, had saved her from the Boxtroll in the alleyway. She couldn't stop thinking about him, she had to see him again. She had brought a small gift basket she had made for all the red hats, filled with expensive cheeses and a bottle of wine. It was for all of them, but it was obvious who she really made it for. She knocked ten times on the big doors. She rocked back and forth on her feet anxiously, as she heard footsteps approach the door. As they got closer, she heard some nasty mumbling, and her heart sank as she knew exactly who was going to answer the door. Archibald Snatcher threw the doors open and as he saw the lady at the door, his eyes grew wide and he stood up to his full height. \"Ah, Miss Monte Cristo! What a surprise!\" A toothy grin crossed his face, but his eyes were like acid on Molly's skin as he stared at her. She cleared her throat before speaking, \"Good day, Mr. Snatcher. I just came by to give all of the exterminators this!\" She held out the basket. \"I just thought that since you all work so hard and for no reward whatsoever you deserved something nice!\" Caught off guard by the kind gesture, Snatcher examined the basket with his eyes before taking it from her hands. \"Thank you, Miss. The gesture is appreciated, but I do get one reward for catching those filthy Boxtroll monsters…\" he stared into the distance as if envisioning his prize. Molly waited for him to finish, but he trailed off into nothing. \"That is…?\" she asked. He focused his attention back onto the woman, \"A white hat.\" he stated proudly, as if he already owned it. Molly wrinkled her brow, what was so great about a stupid hat? \"Why a white hat?\" she voiced her thoughts aloud. He slumped a bit at her question, annoyed with her ignorance. He grew annoyed with her presence, and was ready to see her off. \"Well, it was very nice of you to stop by and bring me this gift, but we here at the Boxtroll Exterminators are very busy and we must get back to work!\" Ignoring her question, he began to close the door. She put her foot in the door to block it from closing. \"Wait!\" she winced as the door closed on her foot. \"Just one more thing!\" Molly inched her way through the slit of the door and pushed it back open. She fixed her dress and asked, \"Is Mr. Pickles here?\" That was the worst question of them all. What did this woman see in that man? Ever since they met, Mr. Pickles had done nothing but talk about her, and it was getting on everyone's last nerves, especially Mr. Snatcher's. \"He's not here right now-\" he tried closing the door again, but she pushed it back open. \"Well then where is he?\" \"Not here.\" Snatcher tried to close the door, but the lady wouldn't budge, she had a tight grip on the outside handle and was keeping it open with all her might. \"Well when will… he be… back?\" She was using all her strength to keep the door open, and she was amazed she was doing such a good job, especially in a corset. Snatcher gave a sinister smile, \"You are a lot stronger than you seem, Miss Molly.\" He let go of his grip and as soon as he did, she pushed the door open and fell down flat onto her chest. \"But not that bright!\" With a single motion he shut the doors to the factory. He lifted the basket and eyed it suspiciously. Each cheese was wrapped in expensive packaging, this was the real stuff, not like what his men brought usually him back from the market place. Rather than eat it, he took it upstairs to familiarize himself with each one. He would need to know these things when he became a white hat anyway. As he walked up the stairs, he popped open the bottle of wine and took a big swig of it. \"Thank you, Miss Molly…\" he laughed eerily.

She had just moved back from Mira, a neighboring town just over the hill, and she wasn't used to any sort of curfew. Her friends warned her about the Boxtrolls, which were never a major threat when Molly lived there before, but she insisted on leaving anyway. She didn't like the idea of staying overnight at someone's house, especially when her own was just a couple miles up town. As she walked on the empty, foggy, streets, something caught her attention. A shadow-like figure in the distance running into an alley. Curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to follow it. The alley was darker than the streets it seemed, a couple trash cans on either side. Whatever she had seen before seemed to be nowhere in sight now. Suddenly, a trash can rumbled, and made the lady jump. She waited for a moment, and out popped a cat. She giggled off the scare as the cat licked it's paw. \"Oh Molly,\" she assured herself, \"you've been reading too many books again.\" She turned to head back home, but didn't notice a small box in front of her and tripped over it. She gave out a small scream as she fell to the floor, landing on her hands and knees. She sat up on her knees and examined the box, she was sure it wasn't there before. The box shook, and she lurched back quickly, expecting another cat to jump out. Instead, a head popped out, a boxtroll head! She screamed in terror, never seeing a real live boxtroll face to face like this before. The Boxtroll screamed back and hid inside it's box. Before Molly could even scream for help, a net was swung over the boxtroll, capturing it in it's clutches. Molly's eyes followed the net up the handle to see a tall, gangly man in red. \"Aha! Caught you, ya filthy beast!\" he proclaimed, \"You won't be hurting no civilians on my watch.\" He swung the net over his shoulder with one hand, and lent the other out to Molly to help her up. \"You alright, miss?\" She took his hand, but rather than stand up, she used it to pull him in for a hug. \"OH THANK YOU SO MUCH! YOU SAVED MY LIFE! I WOULD HAVE BEEN A BOXTROLL'S DINNER IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU!\" The gentleman held his arms back, as not to touch her, dropping his net in the process. The Boxtroll saw it's chance and scurried away into the darkness, not that either of them noticed. The man in red was too preoccupied with the woman clinging to his torso, which no lady has ever done to him before. \"MR. PICKLES!\" a booming voice interrupted, \"You let one of the monsters get away!\" A man with a big gut and mean scowl across his face emerged from out of the fog into the alley. Molly released her grip on the tall man as he stuttered and apologized to his boss. \"I- I did? Oh, it appears I did.\" He rubbed the back of his neck in a mixture of embarrassment and nervousness. \"Sorry, Mr. Snatcher.\" The man referred to as Snatcher rolled his eyes and ignored his stooges apology. He gave Molly a quick up and down look and approached her. He was much taller than her, and his evil demeanor was rather intimidating to a lady like herself. \"What's an upper class woman like yourself doin out here all alone on a Tuesday night?\" He began to circle her like a shark, making her even moor nervous. She cleared her throat, \"Well, I was coming home from a friend's house and I just happened to see something in the alley. Thought it was a cat, but it wasn't, obviously. It was-\" \"A Boxtroll?\" he interrupted her, circling back around to her front and practically nose to nose with her. Molly shrunk and meekly nodded. \"There is a curfew enforced for a reason, Miss. To keep you people safe! Now, how about I escort you home and-\" \"Uh, boss?\" The tall gangly man stepped in. Snatcher turned to him sharply, waiting for an answer to his interruption. \"I- I was thinking maybe I could escort her home?\" His boss thought for a moment, standing between the two, looking back and forth from one to the other. He knew what was going on, his stooge liked this woman. Not that he even had a chance with her. \"I really shouldn't, considering you let one of the beasts get away!\" he stated sternly, looking down the alley where the Boxtroll had ran. \"But i'm feeling a bit generous at the moment, so you may.\" He tossed some hair behind back as he turned on his heel to go back onto the streets. Both Molly and Mr. Pickles glowed at his response. The man shyly held out his arm, and Molly gladly linked hers with it. They began to walk down the street towards her home, which was just a block away. \"I'm terribly sorry if I got you into trouble, Mr…\" she trailed, waiting for a name. Although, she had heard his boss say it already, she was hoping for a full one. \"Oh, it's fine, really. And it's Pickles. Monty Pickles.\" He couldn't look at her, he couldn't even believe he was walking with a lady; arms linked and everything. \"I don't believe I caught your name either.\" \"I am Madame Molly Monte Cristo.\" she said with a hint of brag in her tone. She was rather proud of her long name. While some found it a mouthful, she thought it was grand. \"But you may just call me Ms. Molly.\" \"Ms. Molly.\" Mr. Pickles echoed. The name was like a melody in his head. The perfect name for the perfect lady. They stopped at the top of Cheesebridge, just outside the market place. \"Well, this is my home.\" she said, as they stood before the door of a tall home with a single door. It looked rather common for the home of a madame, but Pickles didn't question it. \"Thank you, again, for saving me from the boxtroll. And for escorting me home.\" Monty tipped his hat to her, \"It was no trouble at all, Miss. That's just the job of a Red Hat.\" He smiled, finally getting to look her in the eyes. They were a dazzling green, with a warmth that matched her sunny, boisterous, hair. She began up the stairs to her door, but before grabbing the knob, she turned back to her hero. \"Perhaps we will see each other around town?\" she asked hopefully. He was shocked a lady like herself would ever want to meet a man like him again. He wasn't an aristocrat, he was a simple man who only owned one pair of pants. She wasn't in his league, and he knew it, but still his heart gave a flutter every time she spoke. \"Perhaps we will.\" he answered with a toothy smile. Molly giggled and opened her front door. \"I hope we will. Goodnight, Mr. Pickles.\" she began to close the door, and while he could still see her he waved, \"Goodnight, Ms. Molly\" The door clicked shut, and he turned away from it. He gave a happy sigh, \"Ms. Molly.\" he repeated. On the other side of the door, Molly faced away and gave a sigh as well, \"Mr. Pickles.\" She placed a hand over her heart as she made her way up to her room. Mr. Pickles strolled merrily down the empty streets back to his colleagues and their exterminator-mobile. He hopped on his usual spot where he dangled off the side, a big grin slapped across his face. His best friend Mr. Trout noticed right away. \"What's that all about?\" Monty swung forward to see his pal better. \"Mr. Trout, i'm in love.\" \"I'm flattered, but i'll have to say no.\" the big man joked. Mr. Pickles swung back to his spot, still smiling. \"Not with you! With Madame Molly Monte Cristo.\" \"Ooh, fancy!\" Mr. Gristle interjected from his backseat. Pickles nodded, \"She is! A one of a kind lady she is! Never met one like her before.\" The car shook as Snatcher climbed to his seat on top. He rolled his eyes, \"If you've met one, you've met them all, Mr. Pickles. Don't be fooled by a lady's tricks. Especially one such as herself.\" Monty paused, his smile failing. \"I don't know, she seems special.\" \"Special?\" Snatcher practically spat the word. Literally, Mr. Trout swore felt some spit hit the back of his head. \"Ha! Even if she was, you really think someone as high as her would ever give a man like you a chance? A man like any of us? Those kid of people don't respect us. We work and slave for them and what do we get? Nothing.\" Mr. Pickles heart sank, his boss wasn't entirely wrong. They had encountered quite a few houitey-touity people who were rather rude to them. Molly wasn't one of them though, but what if her friends were? Was she just being friendly rather than flirty? Questions started to cloud his mind and worry him. His boss was probably right, Molly didn't feel that same way for him as he did for her.

All it ever did was stare at him. Smiles all around for Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout, even laughter for Mr. Gristle, but not Mr. Snatcher. Only two weeks ago Archibald Snatcher stole the infant from the local inventor Herbert Trubshaw, and each day since then he was faced with the same blank stare. \"How long you think we'll have this little guy around for?\" Mr. Pickles had asked just that morning over breakfast. \"Obviously until the machine is built, Mr. Pickles.\" Mr. Snatcher hissed as he rubbed the sleepiness from his eyes. \"Are you alright boss? Did the baby keep you up with it's sad wailing again?\" Mr. Trout asked as he placed a breakfast of scrambled eggs before the tired man. \"It always cries around me.\" He grumbled before shoveling the fresh food into his mouth, not daring to look up from his plate. He already knew the baby was staring, he could feel it's tiny piercing gaze upon him as always. Sitting in it's makeshift highchair, Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout flocked to it, cooing and making ugly faces, eliciting giggles from it. \"Who's ready for breakfast?\" Mr. Trout asked as he prepared a bowl of orange mush, stirring it with a miniature spoon dwarfed by his enormous hands. \"Hold on, gotta put the bib on him first. Don't want a messy little hostage do we?\" Mr. Pickles laced a tiny cloth napkin around his neck which draped well past his knees. Archibald was in disbelief over how the pair of stooges could coddle such a thing. Thinking at least Mr. Gristle, as dimwitted as he was, had some sense to stay focused on the task at hand. \"Hah hah, tiny spoon for tiny baby!\" Or not. The third stooge now watched on in childish delight as Mr. Trout fed the adorable captive, the trio couldn't help but laugh as the baby spit up the last bit of food all over the bib. As Mr. Pickles used the bottom of the napkin-bib to clean the mess off it's face, it's head began to turn. Turned and stared right at Mr. Snatcher, still seated across the room at the table, uncaring of the mess it made or the men who cleaned it. \"Enough!\" He yelped suddenly. The three men froze as he stood up from the breakfast table and strode across the room towards the hostage. It still stared at him, head craned upwards to meet his gaze, beady eyes unblinking. Archibald felt a chill run down his spine, but continued to stare back, refusing to show fear. \"Erm, boss. Is everything alright?\" Mr. Trout broke the silence, concern plastered on his face as well as the faces of Mr. Pickles and surprisingly Mr. Gristle. \"I'm putting it back upstairs until lunch.\" Mr. Snatcher announced hoisting the infant out of it's seat. He carried the child with arms outstretched for as much distance between them and, of course, facing away from him. \"I don't think that's quite a good idea boss.\" Mr. Pickles interjected nervously, yet his feet did not move to follow after his superior. Once upstairs in his bedroom Archibald was quick to place the infant back in it's makeshift crib, which was a spare cage lined with a pillow, quite suitable for a hostage. He sat upon his plush bed and looked over at the child, who for once was far too preoccupied to stare, instead choosing to suckle the bars that confined him. Pleased to be rid of the child, Archibald grabbed his embellished red coat and matching red hat before leaving his quarters. Downstairs, the exterminators had busied themselves by cleaning up all traces of breakfast in his short absence. Archibald smiled and donned his red hat as he announced he was stepping out to visit a certain inventor, adding that the Trubshaw baby was not to leave it's crib under any circumstances. — Archibald smiled through the streets of Cheesebridge, bustling with busied people shuffling to and from. He didn't even have to knock on the door when he arrived at his destination, Herbert was quick to usher him inside, and Archibald was even quicker to make himself at home. He took a seat on the living room sofa, placing his hat on the seat beside him and his feet upon the short table before him. Herbert scowled as he stood before his criminal guest and huffed. \"Where is my son? I want to see my baby boy!\" He demanded. \"You want to see your son and I want to see some progress. You gotta earn your visitation rights Trubshaw.\" Snatcher snapped. \"I have only drawn up some designs for your killing machine so far, is that satisfactory enough for you? Will I be able to see my boy?\" He pleaded, his eyes filling with fresh tears. \"Maaaaybe,\" he teased, \"show me what you've got.\" Snatcher brought his feet off the table as Mr. Trubshaw splayed various parchments before him, each one bearing a different design for the boxtroll capturing machine he needed to obtain his white hat. \"No. No. No.\" Snatcher said simply as he began to crumple up design after design, tossing the wads in any direction. He was about to crumple one more when he paused and gave it another look over, his eyes widened and he bared his crooked grin. \"Yes. This is the one!\" He exclaimed. He rose and shoved the drawing back into the inventor's hands. \"This is perfect, Herbert, this is the one! I can see myself manning this masterpiece of machinery now, marching up to Portley-Rind's manor and-\" \"I want to see my son.\" Snatcher sneered at this interruption but agreed, he would bring his son home to visit for only 2 hours. The visit would be supervised by himself and his men, no authorities and no funny business. Or else. — As he made his way down the beaten path to his home, Archibald daydreamed of his destiny. The design of his extermination machine would one day soon be a reality, there was, however, the problem of builders as well as a location to house such a fine invention. A problem that he would think about in the days to come, after the next days visitation. As he neared the door to his factory he heard shrill cries and panicked voices from within, whipping out his keys he quickly unlocked the heavy door and bolted inside. Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles unsurprisingly had the Trubshaw baby with them, Mr. Trout rocked the screaming child in his bulky arms while Mr. Pickles tried to keep him calm with silly faces. Mr. Gristle came running over to them with a bottle of milk ready, but the baby refused. \"Gentlemen!\" Archibald bellowed, his booming voice echoing throughout the factory. The men stood at attention, the horrendous screaming child still softly rocked in Trout's arms. \"M-Mr. Snatcher! We can explain! Not too long ago the baby just got fussy and we've been tryin' to make him quiet. But nothing we do is working, we don't know what's wrong! Honest!\" Mr. Pickles blurted out at once. Mr. Snatcher's face contorted in anger, the lower eyelid of his left eye twitching. He wanted to scream, though he doubted he could raise his voice loud enough to contest the child that was still screaming. He inhaled deeply to calm himself and noticed a foul stench that invaded the normally stagnant air of the factory. \"Not again,\" he thought. \"Mr. Gristle fetch some towels. Mr. Pickles prepare a clean diaper. As for you, Mr. Trout, hand it over.\" The towels were laid upon the only table they had, the same where they had eaten breakfast earlier that morning. Mr. Trout carefully laid the infant down on the changing station they made and began to peel off the layers of clothing it wore, with each layer removed the smell grew stronger. The burly man hesitated when he finally made it to the dirty diaper, his hands shaking and nostrils flaring at the odor. \"Hurry up, you fool!\" Archibald snapped. Trout did as told and undoubtedly regretted it once he saw what waited inside. \"How could such a little baby make such a mess?!\" Mr. Pickles coughed as he pinched his nostrils shut. \"Gross! Gross! Eww!\" Mr. Gristle turned away in disgust. Mr. Trout's eyes watered and Mr. Snatcher felt his begin to as well. His eyes trailed from the unspeakable diarrhea to the baby's face to reveal child was doing more than just simply staring. Though it wasn't the first dirty diaper this baby produced, it certainly was the worst. For the first time, the child smiled at Archibald Penelope Snatcher. \"Mr. Trout, clean the hostage!\" \"I-I-I can't! I can't! I'm gonna-\" He didn't finish his sentence, instead clamping his giant hands over his mouth before hurrying to the loo. \"Mr. Pickles!\" \"Me, sir? I-I don't believe I have the stomach for it either!\" \"Bah!\" Archibald grabbed the dirty diaper and threw it in the trash, Mr. Gristle grabbed the trash and took it outside to air out. The baby thrashed, kicking at Mr. Snatcher's hands as he wiped away the mess. \"He's clean now, diaper him Mr. Pickles.\" The slender man's hands moved to clothe the child but, truth be told, he had never changed a diaper before. \"That's not how you change a diaper! Do I have to do everything?!\" Mr. Snatcher pushed the thin man away and stood before the child, but the Trubshaw baby would not go down without a fight. Mr. Snatcher had just slid part of the diaper under the baby's bottom when he felt it, a warm and wet sensation on his paunch. When he heard Mr. Pickles audibly gasp he had an idea of what it was, when he saw the child smiling at him once more he knew he was right. — The child fell asleep immediately after dinner, having been upstairs alone between the diaper changing and feeding. Mr. Snatcher retired early and sent his men home, his head pounding worse than morning and he hope the child would stay asleep through the night. He would need as much sleep as he could get, the two of them had a big day ahead of them visiting Herbert Trubshaw. Archibald laid down to sleep, sparing one last glance at his prisoner still silently sleeping. He laid on his back for quite a while, eyes shut, waiting for sleep to overcome him. He was almost there, feeling himself drifting away when he snapped back into reality by a harsh screech coming from the right of his bed. His limbs thrashed as he jolted up, the baby squirming and fussing uncontrollably. Archibald got out of bed and begrudgingly held the child, human contact calmed the child a little and even in the darkness of his room he knew it stared at him. \"Child,\" he sleepily sighed, \"why must you scream? Have you any idea how late it is? Babies are supposed to like sleep, why don't you?\" He began to lower the child into it's cage only for it to emit another ear piercing shriek. Desperate for sleep, he laid the baby on the bed beside him, hoping to transfer it back to it's cage once it had fallen asleep. The minutes felt like agonizing hours spent beside the child who did little more than play with it's fingers and toes with no intention of going back to sleep. Archibald laid on his side watching the child entertain himself and sighed, he outstretched a slender finger towards the baby. It's little hands softly gripped his finger and brought the tip to it's mouth, lightly suckling and slobbering. Archibald felt his lips contort into a smile as he withdrew his digit, with the absence of his finger the child began to blow drool bubbles. He couldn't help but chuckle, whether it was beacause of his sleep deprivation or how ridiculous his situation was he couldn't tell. \"Boo boo boo.\" He cooed at the child as his stooges had earlier in the day and the child smiled. He held his hand out with fingers spread, the baby grabbed his thumb in one tiny hand and ring finger in another. When he wiggled the digits in the child's grip he erupted in squealing laughter. Two weeks. It took two weeks but he finally got the baby to smile and laugh as it did with all others. Before he even knew it, he began to sing to the baby. Softly at first, barely a whisper, captivating the child before him. He sang, making up rhyming lyrics as he went, the baby expressing it's delight in squeals all through out. The playful interaction between them continued well into the wee hours of the morning until sleep overcame them both. The next morning Archibald awoke on his right side, his eyes groggily refusing to stay open causing him to blink countless times until they adjusted. His eyes focused on the empty crib, he knew it was missing something but in his sleepy state he couldn't remember what. His memory was quickly jogged by the painful tugging of his long greasy strands, he carefully turned and saw the Trubshaw baby tangling himself in his hair. Archibald softly pried open the child's hands but he only grabbed more handfuls in his iron baby grip. Once he freed himself of the grabby baby he sighed in relief, glad that in his sleep he did not manage to accidentally roll over and crush the child under his weight. If that had been the case it would have made today's visitation and any further blackmail difficult. Archibald scooped the child up in his arms, cooing to him once more as he did the night before. \"Let's get ready to see your daddy, shall we?\" — The exterminators paid Mr. Trubshaw a visit around noon, the man having waited on his porch for them to arrive before quickly ushering them in. As promised, Herbert Trubshaw's son would be reunited with him just for two hours before returning to the factory. Mr. Snatcher had carried the baby boy himself and as he tried to pass him to his father he felt the tight grip of his little fist around yet another strand of hair. Herbert was quick to pull his son away and clutch him close, tears beginning to roll down his face as he sputtered about how much he loved and missed him. It was also now that he noticed how unruly the inventor looked. He still wore the same clothing from the previous day, his unkempt hair now oily, he most likely hadn't shaved since in weeks and his bloodshot eyes were lined with dark circles. The scene before Snatcher made him feel something, he couldn't quite place what it was. A heavy and hollow feeling on the inside he hadn't felt in quite some time. Snatcher seated himself on the same sofa from his last visit, his men also got comfortable as Mr. Trubshaw sat on the floor with his son and began to play with him. He laid on his back and lifted the baby high above him, only to bring him down face to face and blow raspberries at him before raising him above once more. The child screeched in delight, sounding happier than they had ever heard him before. \"Wheee! Wheee!\" The inventor would exclaim each time the child ascended. \"Look at how high up you are, Arthur!\" Arthur. It hadn't dawned on him before, but Mr. Snatcher never even knew the child's name till this moment. He hadn't even given it much thought, originally seeing little Arthur as the only power he had over the playful man on the ground. He continued to watch him play with Arthur, now having the infant lay on the ground to play peekaboo. Each reveal of his face making the child laugh hysterically. Jealous. Archibald Snatcher was jealous of this man. Jealous of the love his son had for him. Jealous of the life he lived. Jealous of how he accomplished what men like him strove for, success, love and a family. When he would finally exterminate the boxtrolls with the glorious machine this inventor would build for him, then he could go about getting his white hat claiming he had done Cheesebridge a great service. Earning a white hat would mean success for him, and one out of three wasn't so bad. The two hours quickly passed and Herbert tried to reason with them to let the child stay for a little longer, but Mr. Snatcher would not allow it. Tears began to flow freely down the inventor's reddened cheeks, he sputtered and pleaded, even so much as reaching out to his son who Snatcher held. Mr. Gristle stood between the two men, baring his crooked teeth in warning like an animal. \"Please, my boy means the world to me. H-He's all I have left.\" He faltered. \"We'll be in touch.\" Is all Mr. Snatcher said as he took his leave. — The next couple months had flown by, Mr. Snatcher had established that the construction of his destructive machine would be in the basement of his factory. Herbert had no choice to comply. On a brighter note for the inventor, as his work kept him in the factory he was closer to his son and able to interact with him every day he worked. The downside is that Trubshaw and his son were not the only ones confined to the factory, because the exterminators were not good help for building they had to find Herbert some help. Help which came from shackled boxtrolls they had captured, the same creatures the inventor had only months ago befriended he now felt he betrayed. Herbert felt nothing but shame in his actions and his work, and each time he would enter the factory and see Arthur sitting upon the lap of Archibald Snatcher he felt nothing but guilt. As for Snatcher, he no longer minded his little hostage. The child had begun to really grow on him, and already he had learned his first word. Just that morning as he finished feeding him breakfast he heard Arthur's tiny voice. \"Da-da!\" It was only a split second but he felt nothing but pride. He smiled as big as he could as he clutched the boy to his chest. Mr. Trout and Pickles both smiled with him as they cooed the child in his arms. In the back of his mind he knew that one day, with the completion of his machine, Mr. Trubshaw would want his son back. He had plenty of time to decide if he would oblige, but already Mr. Snatcher had begun to plot various ways to avoid doing so. ","Summary":" It stared at him. All it ever did was stare at him.

The streets were always covered in snow and ice, it was hard to keep warm in your homes (unless you were a Portly-Rind, so to speak), and certain businesses were always having trouble with their jobs, because mostly everyone insisted on staying indoors, due to the harsh weather. However, today was different. It was Christmas Eve. Two years ago, Eggs had reunited with the citizens of Cheesebridge with his father, and with Winnie's help. The boxtrolls took refuge in the old, abandoned Red Hats' lair, where they stayed most of their time during the winter; no one ever saw them that much while their town was drenched in snow. Winnie had told Eggs about Christmas since the season came around, a few months later after he and his father moved back into their old house, which was abandoned at first, but with the help of many people, their happy little home was back to the way it was. \"What's Christmas?\" Eggs had asked. Winnie had smiled widely that day, and motioned towards all around the decorations that the town had set up. \"Christmas is a very pretty and happy time of the year! It's about joy, and love, and giving to others. It's also a day where friends and family can get together, and share warm, gentle moments. It's all about effort and care. The holiday just makes me feel so warm inside!\" She squealed. Eggs grinned while watching her excitement. When Christmas came, Winnie had invited Eggs and his father over to their house for their annual Christmas party. Eggs never had so much fun in his entire life. Once they turned twelve, and Christmas was nearing, Eggs wanted to know more about the holiday, as asked Winnie about it yet again. \"I loved Christmas last year,\" he'd said. \"But I wanna know more; what else is there for Christmas?\" Winnie looks up from her book as she sat down next to the fireplace in her mansion. Eggs's father and her father were currently discussing some business in the Tasting Room, and they've only been alone with nothing to do for the past thirty minutes than reading. \"I'll gladly tell you more, Eggs,\" Winnie replied, setting her book down on the small table before sitting on the carpeted floor, next to the fire. She pats the spot next to her, having Eggs take the spot. Eggs does so, eager to hear more. After ruffing her light-and-dark green dress and dark green bows, Winnie continued with a story that had Eggs amazed. \"Christmas is also a very special day, because of two iconic figures - one giving us gifts, and the other giving us salvation.\" \"Who are these figures?\" Eggs asked with such curiosity that it putted all cats to shame. Winnie smirked. \"Santa Clause - one of the figures - is a fat man in a red suit and white beard, who delivers presents to good children all around the globe. It's just a myth, really, but it does symbolize one of the means of Christmas: giving to others.\" Eggs nodded, catching on. \"Okay, and the other?\" \"Our salvation came from who is considered our 'lord and savor', Jesus Christ. He died for our sins on a cross, and rose again on the third day after his death. He died, because that's what his father, God, had planned.\" \"That's… horrid !\" Eggs exclaimed, shocked that a father would want his own son to die. The thought was simply making him sick to his stomach. Winnie nodded. \"Yeah, I suppose. But his father used his powers to resurrect Jesus, so that he can join him in Heaven, and so we can carry out his story.\" \"What's Heaven, and who's God?\" \"Those are stories for another time,\" Winnie stated. \"However, I will say that God is a spirit - very powerful - and created our world. Jesus's birth was very magical, because his mother, the Virgin Mary, gave birth to him on Christmas !\" Eggs gawked at her. \"Christmas is his birthday?\" \"Mhm,\" she replied, nodding. \"And that's what most people consider this holiday to be about - worshiping our lord.\" \"Wow…\" Those pass two years, Eggs had learned a thing or two of Christmas, but now, this year, he never suspected something more. Now thirteen, Eggs checked himself out in the mirror, adjusting his red-and-gold coat. \"Edward!\" his father, Herbert, called from downstairs. \"Are you ready?\" \"Coming, Father!\" Today was his third Christmas, and Eggs had decided that this was his favorite holiday. There was just so much joy and fables about this holiday that made him feel warm and happy. And tonight, he was going to give Winnie a gift. After learning about Santa Clause last year, he decided to do exactly that - give to others - meaning her. The night was young, and snow fell down gently. The Portly-Rind butler escorted the two inside the mansion, and was welcomed to the sight of a large Christmas tree in the center of the room. \"Eggs!\" Winnie called, approaching them. Eggs smiled, blushing as he saw her in her dress. Her dress was white, with a red trim, and had green bows and two leaf-looking objects on both sides in her hair. She looked gorgeous. \"Merry Christmas,\" she says. \"Y-Yeah, Merry Christmas,\" Eggs replies. \"Oh! Here you go; I hope you like it!\" Winnie gasped at the beauty of the small box wrapped in red wrapping paper, complete with green bow. She accepted her gift, and opened it, seeing a gold necklace, which made her eyes sparkle with awe. \"My goodness…\" she whispers, looking at him. \"Eggs, where did you…?\" \"My father pays me for helping him with his inventions sometimes,\" he confesses. \"I've been saving since last year, after you told me about Santa, and how we give to others. You like it?\" \"Like it? I love it! Oh, Eggs, thank you! This is absolutely beautiful !\" Eggs was taken by surprise once Winnie wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him close into a warm embrace. Smiling, Eggs hugged back. \"You're welcome,\" he says. After a while, Eggs and Winnie shared a dance around the tree before sneaking off outside. They walked down towards where the boxtrolls's new hiding place was, where they've decorated a tree for the year, and enjoys the Christmas night, side-by-side. \"I really do love this gift, Eggs,\" Winnie says, looking down at her necklace, which she'd put on shortly after receiving it. \"Thank you, once again.\" \"You're welcome,\" Eggs replies, observing the tree that his boxtroll friends had put up by themselves. Winnie's happy expression soon faded, realizing something. \"Oh, Eggs, I nearly forgot about your gift!\" Eggs's attention was soon on her again, and he turned around to face her with an amazed expression. \" My gift?\" he asked. Winnie nods. \"Yes; I've gotten you a very special gift,\" Eggs was confused once he notices her taking a left-like object out of her hair, and dangles it in the air, in-between them. She looked like she was slightly blushing, smiling warmly at him. Eggs, however, didn't seem to understand the concept. \"What's that you just pulled out of your hair?\" Eggs asked, pointing towards the object. \"I thought that was only for decoration?\" \"It's a mistletoe, silly!\" she chirped. \"Don't you know what happens when two people are under it?\" Eggs's bewildered expression summed it all up. Rolling her eyes, Winnie laughed. \"Here, let me show you…\" she says, pulling him closer. Their lips soon touched, which shocked Eggs. She was kissing him! When she pulled back, his face was redder than his own coat, which was mildly amusing to Winnie. \"Merry Christmas, Eggs.\" Winnie says, leaning her head on his shoulder as she looks up at the stars. Finally, Eggs shook his head from his shocked experience, and looks down at her. It takes a moment for him to accept it, and smiles warmly at her. He then wraps his arm around her waist, and pecks her head before looking up at the stars with her. \"Merry Christmas to you too, Winnie.\" THE END I hope you enjoyed this! I plan to update more of my stuff in the future, so keep an eye out! *Sings* I wish you a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! ;D See ya soon, and happy holidays, ~Nixter97~ ","Summary":" Merry Christmas, to everyone! :) Hope you enjoy, ~Nixter97~ Christmas Winter was a rough time for t"},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Fish's Violin","Author":"bedstories","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10850791","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Fish was many things, but music lover was one thing he never knew he was. He knew music, I mean, who didn't? But his passion was tinkering and picking up trash to reuse, like his fellow Boxtrolls. It never occurred to him trash could make beautiful noise until one night, when he was looking through a trash can dangerously close to a house, he heard something strange and attracting coming from the building. It wasn't like clanking bottles, or rattling cans or any other kind of noise he'd heard from the trash. It was…different. He peeked from the corner of the window, unsure of what he'd expect, when he saw one of the most beautiful items he'd ever seen. A man was playing a sort of…box, with strings that shook and sang with every stroke of a weird looking stick he used to play it. His family was around the fireplace, the children looking up to him in wonder and the woman with a twinkle in her eyes Fish recognized but really didn't want to dwell in its meaning at the time. Suddenly, the man stopped playing and the beautiful noise stopped and in a matter of seconds, Fish was being chased by an angry family of six back to his sewer hole. With a slide that cost him his nose, Fish slipped down a sewer and closed the lid with a gigantic thud, the sounds of rocks banging against the metal lid echoing through the tunnel as he climbed down and slid back to his home. ~ o ~ The next day (and I strictly emphasize the word \"day\") all he could think of and dream of was the sweet sounds of that…thing he'd seen the night before. He could practically see the musical notes dancing around him and he imagined his self, dressed in a nicer box than the one he had on, in front of millions of other Boxtrolls, with that musical thing tucked under his neck, playing it for all of them to hear. It was exciting. With his heart racing in his chest, Fish got up, as quietly as he could to not wake his fellow Boxtrolls, then raced back to the tunnel he'd been chased down from, and climbed until he was only a lid away from going outside. He could hear the other people walking just outside the sewer, but he heard nothing of the musical thing he'd heard the other night. Just cheese, for a change… \"Fish! Fish!\" Fish looked down and it was Shoes who was whispering his name as he climbed up the staircase up to his friend. \"Shoess?\" \"Why are you up? It's late!\" Shoes scolded him, the slur of sleep still dragging his words and covering his eyes just a little. \"Why are you up, then? I'm just…looking out.\" Fish said, turning back to the sewer lid and lifting it up a little to see better. Fish took a peek outside and saw a huge cart with nothing on it but beautiful music boxes with strings and a sign that read \"Violins\". A very tall, very skinny, very well-dressed man was driving the cart, yelling at the top of his lungs, \"Violins! Violins for sale! Get your violin! Handmade, guaranteed to last a lifetime!\" Violins … Fish thought, the same twinkle he'd seen in the woman's eyes now shining in his. He gave a small excited gasp and jumped, banging his head on the lid of the sewer and laughed. \"Violins!\" \"Vaio-what?\" \"Vio-lins, Shoes, violins!\" \"What you talking about?\" \"I saw one! Last night! They sound beautiful…\" Fish explained, with the excitement and joy Shoes only found in trash. The smaller Boxtroll raised a brow and tilted his head, not understanding what was so exciting about \"vaioleens\". That is, until Fish lifted the sewer lid a little more, \"Fish, no!\" \"BOXTROLL!\" a woman screeched, and suddenly, the whole town was stepping on the sewer lid and banging it against Fish's head. \"Fish, get down!\" Shoes hissed, pulling Fish back down through the sewer tunnel to escape the rocks and gunshots of the terrorized people of Cheesebridge. They slid through the cardboard covered tunnel and arrived to where the Boxtroll's were sleeping. Correction, angrily waking and growling at the two young ones. \"What's the ruckus?!\" Specs snarled, grumpy from the lack of sleep. \"Nothing! We swear! Sorry for the noise, go back to sleep.\" Shoes instantly said, observing that Fish was looking into space, like he was in a dream. The army of Box trolls grumpily did as they were told, getting back to their sleep and forgetting the sudden noise the two young ones had started at such hours of the day. Shoes laughed nervously as redemption and then glared at Fish, who was getting ready for sleeping as well. \"Happy, Fish? You woke up all sewer!\" \"Shh, Shoes! You wake them up again!\" Fish whispered, putting a finger to his mouth and getting inside his box. Shoes stormed over to his friend and opened his box, looking in just to scold him, \"We almost got killed, Fish! Why you so into those… \"vaioleens\"? What is it?\" \"…it's different.\" Fish said, and then he closed his box permanently. Shoes huffed and hid into his box as well, growling and muttering stuff under his breath about his friend… ~ o ~ That night, Fish was the first to get up and run up to the surface. Shoes wasn't far behind, making sure his friend didn't scare any more humans, as the Boxtrolls made their nightly round collecting trash. Fish was desperately running from trash can to trash can, throwing everything out and searching, then ending with an annoyed growl and going to the next one to repeat the process. Shoes tried his best to scavenge something out of his friend's work, but Fish was going so fast he couldn't catch up! \"Fish, slow down! You going too fast!\" Shoes panted as he saw Fish was taking his time with one trash can. \"I don't get it…no violins.\" \"Oh, I see, the \"vaioleen\" thing again.\" Shoes said, disappointed and irritated. Suddenly, the two heard some girly giggles coming their way, and the two quickly hid inside their boxes. \"Told you! \"Shh!\" \"You really are crazy, Nina!\" one of the giggles said, making the other giggle, giggle again. \"I was just being honest! Have you seen the stranger that just moved here? The one who sells violins?\" \"Oh, yes, he seems very nice, although his violin's look mediocre…\" \"Of course not! I wish I could buy one, that way I could leave it at James' doorway and he could play it for me…\" \"You mean the Portley's child? The kid's a cheese addict! \"Oh, shut up! He's brilliant.\" \"But if you want a violin anyway, you could go to the violin seller's concert tomorrow and buy it there. Then we'll see the true quality of his violins!\" \"You're right! Now let's get out of here before Boxtrolls catch us!\" \"I agree!\" The two giggles ran away, leaving the two Boxtrolls behind in the scene. \"Ew! Girls…\" Shoes shuddered, shaking his head and blubbering. When he saw Fish gong frantically from can to can again, he rolled his eyes. \"Explain why you acting weird, Fish…\" Shoes demanded. When his friend merely shrugged, he sighed, \"Is it because of those…\"vaioleens\"?\" \"Yes!\" \"Fish, are you in love?\" \"No! No, no, no, you no idea! I have to have a violin…\" Fish explained, picking up a piece of metal and putting it on his face, like a mustache. \"Wait, now? What are you planning?!\" Shoes said, stopping Fish from whatever he was doing. Fish grabbed a hold of Shoe's shoulders and smiled, \"I'm going to dress as human and get one.\" he explained, letting go and continuing his work. \"What?! No, Fish…\" Shoes sighed and poked Fish's box. Fish looked back at him, at first joyous but then confused as he saw his friend displeased. \"…what?\" \"Fish, you can get a \"vaioleen\" later. Human's throw everything away! Just wait…\" \"No, Shoes, I can't. I need one! Violins are beautiful, there's nothing like one! It's like…wow.\" Fish breathed, so obviously star-struck Shoes couldn't deny any longer his friend was thoroughly in love. He knew Fish for long enough to know what the twinkles in his eyes meant. And because he knew Fish for so long, he gulped down his pride and put his hands in his hips. \"What's plan, then?\" \"What?\" Fish said, looking back. \"You want \"vaioleen\", yes? Then, what's plan? I want to help.\" Fish stared for a little while at his friend, and then smiled. ~ o ~ The very next day, and hiding their plans from the other Boxtrolls, Fish and Shoes got up and got ready for the violin concert in a few hours. Fish climbed on top of Shoe's box, and then the two put on their huge coat, huge hat, fake mustache and weird mountain boots to complete the look of a human. Then, they walked over to the most hidden sewer in the city and walked out, following the crowd of civilians going precisely to the same concert. \"Ow! Careful with feet, Fish!\" Shoes hissed \"Shh! People will notice you.\" Fish hissed back, looking up to admire the crowd of people in front of the violin-selling man's cart. The man was on top of his cart, dressed even nicer than the day before and a violin tucked under his neck, just like Fish had dreamed himself to be. \"Wow…\" he breathed, as the man cleared his throat and greeted his audience, \"Good morning, citizens of Cheeebridge! I apologize for waking you all so early in the day, but the music contained in these violins cannot wait any longer than now. In this concert I bring you joy, I bring you peace, I bring you emotion and I bring you hope. Enjoy as it drains from my instrument.\" \"He speak like politician.\" Shoes growled, utterly irritated by the fancy words of the man. Fish kicked his head from inside the coat and looked back at him, fascinated not by his words but by the talent he began to demonstrate. As a beautifully soft melody began to play from the violin, Fish gave a soft sigh and smiled. That's what he most loved: the music he never heard from bottles, nuts, bolts or cans. He couldn't think of any sound better than the sounds of the violin's strings. They transported him to places he couldn't reach, they reminded him of things he thought he'd forgotten and they made him feel things he thought he'd never feel again. If Shoes could only imagine what it was… maybe he was right! He was in love… And so was a woman not far behind Fish. The woman was big, in all the sense of the word, and she batted her eyes in Fish's direction. She fanned her face and walked closer to the troll, tapping his shoulder, \"Excuse me, sir.\" She sweetly sang, smiling at him. Shoes turned Fish around so that the Boxtroll faced her, and instantly his cheeks got red. \"Uh…yes?\" Fish said, trying to imitate a man's voice. \"I see you're not from around here. May I have the honor of knowing your name?\" she said, getting loser with every word. Fish stuttered and looked back, noting that the violins were starting to sell quickly. \"Uh, uh…Fi…uh…\" \"Fergus!\" Shoes chimed in, pulling both of them away from the woman. \"Ooh, a foreign name! Tell me, where do you come from?\" \"Can't tell! Bye!\" Shoes continued, taking the words right out of Fish's mouth. The woman gasped, rather offended by the rudeness of the \"man\", and when the two were about to leave, she pulled his shoulder back, \"Now, see here!\" \"Look there!\" Shoes was starting to get on Fish's nerves, but the two managed to slip from the woman's grip and run to the violin cart. \"Come back here, coward!\" the woman argued, following behind them. The faster they ran and pushed against the crowd that listened to the violin-selling man play, the faster the violins sold, until only one remained. \"No…\" Fish gasped, his heart racing. He couldn't let the last one go! At a moment's heartbeat, Shoes tripped on a rock and clumsily tried to balance himself and the Boxtroll on top of him. \"Whoa-oa-oa-oah!\" he squeaked, falling on the ground. The man the woman knew as \"Fergus\" was now lying on the ground, broken in two with his mustache flying elsewhere and the hat flying away. She, along with the rest of the crowd and the violin-selling man gave a terrified gasp as Fish and Shoes got up and revealed their true identities… \"BOXTROLLS!\" \"Run for it!\" \"Boxtrolls?\" the man cooed, more curious than frightened with the small, awkward creatures. Shoes gave a frightened squeal (like a pig, actually…) and made a run for it. \"Fish, let's go!\" he said, racing to the nearest sewer. But Fish didn't run behind him, but instead ran in the direction of the crowd. \"My violin!\" Fish yelled, jumping on the cart and grabbing the last violin. Suddenly, a human hand grabbed his own Boxtroll one, and soon he found himself staring at the face of the man he admired for playing violins. Fish gave a scared gasp and held on tighter to his love, as the man growled at him, \"Let. Go. Of. My. Merchandise.\" \"Never!\" Fish growled back, biting the man's hand so he would let go. \"Aaargh!\" \"Fish, come on!\" Shoes encouraged, keeping the lid of the sewer open as he ducked rocks and avoided any cheese the citizens threw at him. Fish ran back towards his friend, the precious item now in his hands. As he raced towards the sewer, he thought of all the joy he would bring to the underground sewer world; all the melodies he would play, all the emotions he would bring up…it was enough to bring some tears to his eyes. But all of a sudden, a man took out a gun and pointed at Fish's feet. \" FISH!\" Shoes yelled. Bang! The bullet ricocheted dangerously close to Fish's feet, hurting him but not breaking him. He tripped on the ricochet and by accident let the violin go. Fish fell face first on the concrete, but he quickly snapped his head back and saw the violin fly over him. \"No!\" Crack! \"My last violin! You disgusting vermin from hell, you shall pay!\" the violin-selling man said, racing to get to the troll and do as he said. Fish's heart was broken in a million pieces, but he managed to drag his hurt self to the sewer and slide down with Shoes, who was screaming scolds and curses about humans, \"vaioleens\", \"vaioleen\" selling men and stubborn trolls like his friend Fish. But the whole time they hurried down to their home, all Fish could think of was the moment of joy he had when he held the instrument in his hands and how quickly it had gone… \"…my violin…\" he cried, ignoring his fellow Shoes. ~ o ~ The scene was oddly familiar once they arrived at the Boxtroll home: they found all the trolls cross-armed and tapping their feet (and not their boxes in welcome). Shoes got up first and helped Fish get up, because his feet were hurt from the ricochet. \"What did you do?\" the eldest boxtroll asked, voice stern and glaring at them. \"We were just…\" \"We heard ruckus from here! What were you doing?\" another added. \"It was my fault.\" Fish said, just as stern. Shoes looked up to his buddy, whose eyes had become dark with despair he'd never seen in him. \"I wanted violin: I failed. Shoes helped. Sorry.\" He explained, holding in tears. Shoes patted his buddy's shoulder and propped him up again, looking back at the elder, \"Yea, he was in love. I helped, sorry for fright.\" He smiled innocently. The elder shook his head heavily and sighed, seemingly frustrated at the two rebellious Boxtrolls. \"You are both punished: you stay here at night for a week.\" \"Okay, sure, no problem.\" Shoes quickly said, surprised they didn't have to tidy up the whole cave or something like that. The elder brushed them off and walked away with the rest of the community. Shoes gave a wolf whistle and chuckled, \"Oof, that was close, uh, Fish?\" \"Take me to room.\" Fish sadly said, still looking depressed. Shoes' smile disappeared and he did as Fish told him, taking him to a special room he had made for himself and Shoes when they wanted to play. Fish took an old cloth from a pile and broke it in slits, covering his feet and curling up. \"Uh, Fish? M-maybe we could look in a week again. Humans throw everything away, so…\" \"Leave me alone.\" Fish cried from inside his box. Shoes bit his lip and sighed, leaving the other Boxtroll to his thoughts. ~ o ~ A week later, Fish was still inside his box, wallowing in his grief despite that he had permission to go up to the surface and look for a violin, when a knock on his box woke him up from his sad thoughts. He hesitated in going out, since he really wasn't in the mood to do that…but he ultimately did. The bright lights of the Boxtroll room were something he didn't remember, and when his eyes adjusted to the light, in front of him was Shoes, looking up at him nervously and with something behind his back. \"Hi, Fish.\" \"…hi, Shoes.\" \"I, uh…I thought you would like…uh…oh, just take!\" Shoes impatiently shoved a saw and a violin box against Fish's box. The taller Boxtroll let a small \"oof\" escape his lips before actually looking at the objects Shoes had given him. A saw. And a violin bow \"Uh…thank you?\" \"Play it. Like violin.\" Shoes ordered, pointing at them. Fish stared at his friend like he'd grown a second head, but he did as he was told anyway. He placed the saw awkwardly and carefully on his shoulder, because he couldn't tuck it under his neck, and softly passed the bow against the blade. Eeek! The blade screeched hurting both Boxtrolls ears. \"Aah, careful, Fish! Play it like you mean it!\" Shoes scolded, making Fish nervous. Fish passed the box again, earning different screeching sounds for a while, until suddenly the blade didn't screech anymore and instead, it sang. \"Whoa!\" Fish gasped, amazed. \"I found it yesterday, when they let us go up. I didn't find a \"vaioleen\"…but is next best thing, no?\" \"Shoes!\" Fish laughed, honestly laughed, and threw his arms around Shoe's box and hugged him tight, spinning him around and laughing. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" \"Okay, okay, okay, let go!\" Shoes screamed, waving his arms so Fish could set him free. Fish let him down and smiled, the same joy he had felt with the violin in his hands coming back to him as he saw his fellow Boxtroll. \"Thank you, Shoes.\" \"You're welcome, Fish…now play thing before I change my mind.\" A/N: I wrote this about, eh...5 months before the movie came out, more or less, andit was a theory of mine after watching the second teaser trailer of The Boxtrolls, where Fish was playing a saw. Since I hadn't written any serious fanfiction in forever, I gave it a shot and this came out. I had it saved for the day after I saw the movie, but I completely forgot to upload it until now. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it as I did imagining it and writing it :) ","Summary":" Fish was many things, but music lover was one thing he never knew he was. He knew music, I mean, wh"},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Lessons Learned","Author":"Nixter97","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10763667","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This one was a request on tumblr. Once again, I've decided to add this to the Boxtrolls archive on Fanfiction, because this fandom is, sadly, getting not too much attention. :/ Well, anyway, enjoy! ~Nixter97~ Lessons Learned A whole month as passed since the day Snatcher had died due to his server allergic reaction to cheese, and quiet frankly, everyone has gotten use to the changes. In mid-August, the boxtrolls still lived among the city of Cheesebridge with the now not-so-scared citizens. Taking pity on them, and for making themselves seem more \"heroic\", Pickles and Trout had lead their old Red Hats hideout to them as their new home, as an apology for destroying their original home while working for Snatcher- the cavern. Not only did get a new home, but so did Eggs. Herbert Trubshaw and his son had moved back into their old home as soon as they could; right after Herbert got shaved, bathed, and properly clothed once more. He looked as if he'd never left! Eggs had gotten a make-over as well. He gotten out of his dirty clothes and box, and instead, went shopping with Winnie, who'd helped him pick out the right clothes. Speaking of Winnie, she was now telling stories to the people of Cheesebridge. She told the story of Eggs and her adventures with him several times- people especially loved the one of how she discovered the boxtroll cavern. Right now, Winnie was making her way down to Curd's Way, where the boxtrolls' new home stood. Not only was it their new home, but it was also her and Eggs's new hideout. Eggs didn't know what to expect out of this at first, that is, until Winnie claimed, \"That's what best friends do- they build hideouts together.\" Eggs (or Edward, as he was named by his mother, reveled by his father) was already at their little hideout, wearing a simple blue, long-sleeved sweater and sand-brown pants with simple black shoes. He was currently dancing to the tune of one of his favorite records, that was being played by Fish and Shoe. When Winnie entered, Eggs caught her by the arm, and pulled her into a dance. She squealed, surprised by this sudden action. \"C'mon, Winnie, let's dance!\" Eggs says eagerly. \"Eggs, I didn't come here to dance!\" Winnie laughed. \"I came here to continue your lessons.\" Immediately, Eggs stopped; he felt himself sadden some. Shoe stopped the record playing the music, groaning with annoyance. From the corner of her eye, she seeing Shoe attempting to walk away. \"Oh no you don't,\" Winnie says sternly, almost in a hiss. \"Sit your butt down, Shoe! You know you have to do this too!\" Shoe grumbled something that make Eggs's eyes widen. \"Shoe!\" He gasped. \"Watch your language!\" Winnie furrowed her brows together. \"What exactly did he say?\" \"Trust me,\" Eggs says, turning towards her. \"You don't want to know. Now, about today's lesson…\" Winnie simply nods, smiling as she watches Eggs and the boxtrolls sitting down politely, staring up at her. She claps her hands together, looking at the place as if she'd just forgotten what to say. Finally, she spoke. \"Today, I've decided to take you all out on a walk through Cheesebridge. Boxtrolls, you all need to learn how to live among properly still; we do not put any silverware in toasters.\" Some of the boxtrolls mumbled and groaned in protested, as if to say, \"Well, excuse us!\" Winnie then turned to Eggs. \"And Edward, we most certainly do not pee in public .\" Eggs's ears immediately turned into a shade of pink. \"I saw a dog do it!\" He says in defense. \"Besides, I really had to go! I couldn't hold it!\" \"A dog is an animal, Eggs- you're a boy .\" Winnie groaned, disturbed by the horrid memory. The memory of Eggs unzipping his pants to pee on a nearby tree had scarred her and multiple Cheesebridians for life. His father had to ground him in his room for one whole week after that, teaching him how to use an actual bathroom. It was just as horrifying and disgusting to the core as Winnie remembered it; and that was only a month ago! Never forget. \"Thank heavens that you now know the proper way of what's-not-to-be-named,\" Winnie sighed. \"Anyway, today, we are to take a stroll though the town. Let this be a test to see just how much you've learned…so far.\" Winnie then lead a line of boxtrolls out of the abandoned factory. Standing right beside her was Eggs; standing right behind the two were the boxtrolls, all in a straight line. It looked so much like a parade. Winnie greeted each citizen as they passed by; she smiled as Eggs seemed to go the same. \"…Even if it's not a pleasure!\" Winnie's face went grim with embarrassment and sternly glared at Eggs, who went wide-eyed, and covered his mouth. Had he done it again? Yes, yes he had. \"What did I say about that?\" Winnie asks through clenched teeth. \"Why must you take everything I say so literal?\" Eggs frowned. \"My apologies.\" Winnie shrugged it off, continuing to lead the large group through Cheesebridge. As they made it to the town square, children were seen playing hopscotch, woman were wither walking with their husbands, or sitting at benches, watching their children play, or reading a book. One boxtroll approached a woman wearing a feathered hat, and snatched it. The woman shrieked, and Winnie quickly came to the rescue. She forcefully snatched the hat back, and then gave it back to the woman. \"I apologies,\" Winnie quickly exclaims. \"They're still learning how to be civilized!\" She grabs the boxtroll by the hand, leading him back to the awaiting group. \"What's wrong with you?\" She hissed at the creature. \"How many times must I say it: Civilized people- boxtrolls included- mustn't steal what is not thrown away!\" The boxtroll frowned, mumbled what seemed like an apology, and then went inside its box. Eggs came up to Winnie's side, shooting her a glance. \"It's not his fault,\" He defends. \"He's still learning- we all are.\" \"I know,\" Winnie sighed. \"I just wish that this hard work could be paid off.\" And so, Winnie strolled through Cheesebridge with the boxtrolls some more. At one point, a small gang of boxtrolls fought over a loaf of bread that was kindly given to them by the baker; Winnie had to remind them about sharing, and then broke the bread into separate, even pieces. At another point, boy was playing with a ball. It fell into a dumpster, and immediately the same boxtroll from earlier, with the hat incident, retrieved the ball for himself, refusing to return it because he \"threw it away\", as Eggs translated for Winnie. And thus, Winnie was forced to make him return the boy's ball and remind him about returning things to their rightful owners, and how that was an accident- the boy never meant for his ball to land in the dumpster. A man had tried to greet a boxtroll with a handshake, but instead, was received a slap. Winnie had to explain how it wasn't nice to slap other people. Everything was down-right in ruins. Oh, but those weren't even the worst of it. This was… At one point during the day, Eggs had mistaken a pregnant woman for a fat woman. The slim and skinny woman with the large belly had mad Eggs so confused and curious, that he went up to the lady, asking her about her \"pot belly\". Oh, but it got worst… Because as soon as Winnie apologized yet again for the rude behavior, Winnie had to explain why her belly was huge. \"There's a baby in there?\" Eggs asked, bewildered and curious. Winnie nodded. \"Yes, Eggs, there's a baby in there. And in nine months-or whatever month she's on- that baby will be here, in the world with the rest of us.\" \"Oh,\" Eggs says. \"So…where do they come from- the babies?\" Winnie went pink with embarrassment. How was she suppose to answer that? She'd never been given \"the talk\" before, but she did hear rather disturbing rumors from some of her much more older classmates in school. \"Oh, well…umm…\" She fiddled with her fingers, looking straight into Eggs's eyes. \"Whenever a mum and dad…ahh…well…the stork.\" \"The what?\" Eggs asked. \"The stork,\" Winnie repeated. \"It's a bird who delivers babies to mums and dads.\" Eggs shook his head, disbelieved. \"Oh, so the stork delivers the baby, and the mum eats it? That's…rude of her!\" \"I know,\" Winnie rolled her eyes. \"Well, what about us?\" Eggs asked. \"You said yourself that you'd like a baby one day. So, well, why don't we call a stork together?\" Oh. My. God. Winnie went red- both with anger and embarrassment. \"I meant when I'm older!\" She proclaims. \"When I'm an adult, Edward! We're still kids!\"' The rest of the day went on for what seemed like forever, but eventually, Eggs and the other boxtrolls were escorted back home. Winnie sighed, tired from today's events, and began to walk home. Eggs furrows his brow, chasing after her. \"Winnie,\" He began. \"I'm sorry for today. I didn't mean to make you…angry.\" Winnie sighed. \"You didn't make me angry, Eggs,\" She smiled sadly up at him. \"You just need to…learn how to be more proper, that's all. I get that you've spent 10 years underground with those things, but…still. It's time for you to learn how to be more civilized.\" Eggs nodded. \"I can be civilized. Remember all those balls that you keep inviting me to?\" \"Yes, I know you're doing better,\" Winnie agreed. \"But you can't just be sloppy in public, and then proper at balls. That's not how it works, Eggs; you need to be more proper all the time.\" Eggs sighed. \"What will Father think of me, seeing that I'm not getting better out in public. I'm a laughingstock.\" \"No, Eggs, you're not,\" She assures, coming to a halt as they've reached the Trubshaw residence. \"You just need more practice, that's all. Tell you what, tomorrow- just you and me. Okay?\" Eggs beamed. \"Yeah, okay. Sure thing, Winnie.\" Winnie nods. As she was about to leave, Eggs took her by the hand, making her stop. She gives Eggs a confused look. \"Winnie, thank you for helping. You've done so much; I wish there was a way for me to repay you.\" She smiles. \"Aw, Eggs, you don't have to-\" But Eggs interrupted her right there, but pressing his lips upon her. Winnie was shocked, flushed deep red as she felt his lips brushed up against hers. As he pulled away, he whispered, \"Goodnight, Winnie.\" and went inside his house. Winnie just stood there, bewildered of what just happened. She touches her lips, still blushing. He kissed me , She thought. With his lips! She then smiles wide, keeping her current emotion on the rest of the way home. ~THE END~ I hope you enjoyed this! :D More The Boxtrolls fanfiction coming soon! ~Nixter97~ ","Summary":" This one was a request on tumblr.

Completely oblivious to conspiracy that stole both his life and the life of his father. For ten years, Archibald Snatcher plotted and sowed the seeds that would guarantee his undeserving success. Lying and cheating at every chance on a path to self destruction. Despite his actions, no matter how horrible they may be, he is only a man. As are his fellow exterminators, and they have a story all their own. —– Archibald Snatcher had never once stepped food inside the tasting room, only ever stealing glances through the doors left ajar when he visited. From what he saw he knew in the middle of the tasting room stood a grand wooden table surrounded by three wooden chairs with leather seating, in time there would be a fourth chair to join them. From what little of the interior he had seen, he would often dream of his earned seat among the members of the selective society. How they would make pleasant conversation as table surface became covered with various cheeses and wines from places far and wide, all the best that money could buy. His mouth watered at thoughts of each morsel he would taste, but even in his daydreams his body would react to even a mere hint of cheese. Firstly his once pale flesh would redden in color and itch irritably, his lips would begin to tingle and tremble before swelling up like a balloon. His symptoms would not go unnoticed, the faces of other men at the table would contort into a mixture of concern and disgust. He would shovel another forkful of exquisite cheese into his swollen mouth, assuring himself more so than the men that nothing was wrong. Sweat poured down his forehead and his chest heaved, his heart pounding and his lungs struggling to breathe. His head was swimming and he didn't even notice the men pulling themselves out of their seats and wrapping their arms around him, pulling him away from the cheese covered table. They hoisted him out of his seat and pushed him out of the tasting room, slamming the doors in his face. He was all too familiar with the sight of those doors. Too often did he awake from this dream, his chest still heaving and flesh covered with sweat. He would lie still until he was calm again before deciding to start his day, slivers of afternoon sunlight penetrating the curtained windows of his private quarters. He felt a knot in his stomach as he dressed, knowing that he would soon be near the very room that plagued his dreams, the room he both yearned and dreaded. Lord Portley-Rind had called upon him earlier in the week to seek audience with him, undoubtedly to back out of his end of their agreement. Archibald was quick to spread the word, from giving a statement to the local paper to practically screaming it on the streets. Everyone knew Herbert Trubshaw and his son, little Arthur Trubshaw, were dead. Or at least that's what Archibald wanted them to believe, and believe they did. So fearful were the citizens of Cheesebridge that many chose to stop him as he walked in the streets, questioning the safety of the city and what his plan was. He assured them he would rid their fair city of the boxtroll menace, warning them to lock their doors and windows at night and keep their children – and their cheeses close. As he heated his tea kettle and started making his breakfast his mind wandered to Mr. Trubshaw, locked away from the world right beneath his feet. He hadn't fed the captive inventor the day before, as his punishment for his filthy mouth and failure to cooperate. Archibald cracked another egg into the frying pan, though he was still miffed at the memory but he knew that he couldn't let him go without food for too long. He decided he would bring him some breakfast, after he finished his own, perhaps then Herbert would work with him. He prepared a tray of food for his captive. A plate of eggs and a cup of tea, all still warm. Quite generous for a slave, Archibald thought. He descended the hidden stairs to his basement with the tray of breakfast and a candlestick to illuminate each shadowy step. Herbert still slept soundly in his cage, slumped to the side with his face pressed against the bars. Archibald used his guiding candle to light more candles placed around the room, the clacking of his heeled shoes against the ground and the light that now filled the room caused Herbert to stir. He blinked a few times, before narrowing his eyes at his captor. \"Rise and shine, Trubshaw.\" Archibald purred. He placed the tray upon a small table in the corner farthest from the door and pulled up two rickety chairs. The cage door opened, Herbert's joints cracking as exited and stood to his full height. He stretched slightly as Archibald led him to the table. Herbert said nothing, keeping his head down as he scarfed down his breakfast. \"Perhaps after you've eaten you can get to designing my extermination machine just as I asked you last morning.\" Archibald said as he took his seat across from Herbert. \"I suggest you watch your language this time, a gentleman does not use such vocabulary in good company.\" Herbert kept his silence, instead opting to drink his tea before it cooled entirely. Archibald sneered, knowing that nice never got him far. \"I have brought you everything from your home you will need to make your blueprints, and should you need anything else I expect you to tell me immediately. I don't want any further delays.\" \"I need my son and my life back.\" Herbert declared slamming his fists upon the table top, causing Archibald to merely chuckle in response. \"Not this again, I've already told you that you're not going free till I get my machine. As for your son, he's probably dead, you know how blood thirsty and dangerous those boxtrolls can be.\" He smirked at the inventor, whose thin frame now trembled with rage. \"You know that's nothing but a lie, do you really think anyone will believe you?\" Another dark chuckle escaped Archibald's thin lips. \"They already have, but no need to worry yourself about what I told 'em. Now hurry up and finish your breakfast, you've got work to do!\" The thundering of footsteps from the stairs caused Archibald to jerk his head to the source. Mr. Gristle appeared from the shadowy staircase, flashing his usual dopey grin at the sight of his boss. He sighed in relief, inwardly scolding himself for even believing it could have been anyone else. As he turned back to his prisoner, Herbert's fist came down upon Archibald's, which rested upon the surface of the table the entire time he had been sitting there. A searing pain filled his hand, as he jolted up from his seat he realized what the man had done. Herbert's metal fork pierced his flesh deeply, leaving pronged marks. The inventor retracted the utensil, prepared to use it against Mr. Gristle, a pitiful weapon against the little maniac. Gristle tackled the prisoner, pinning him on the ground and wrestled the fork from his grasp. Archibald yelped as he held his injured hand, blood beginning to gush between his pale fingers. Seething with rage he swung his foot at Herbert's head, making satisfying impact. The man was silent and still, merely unconscious, but the pair made sure he wouldn't make the same mistake twice. The two men kicked and thrashed at his limp body, until Archibald felt satisfied. He commanded Mr. Gristle to stop, the short man looking up at him in annoyance, like a child told by a parent that playtime was over. Herbert returned to his cage, left in the dark once more. It had only been two weeks since his capture, but perhaps by the time two months had passed his spirit would break. The span of two months would feel like a lifetime for both captive and captor. Once upstairs, Archibald bandaged his hand the best he could, cursing under his breath as Mr. Gristle fetched his hat and jacket. He finished getting ready and instructed his helper to keep watch over the factory but to not disturb the inventor, he was of no further concern for the day. The sunlight was blinding to a night owl like himself, Archibald shielded his grey eyes with his bandaged hand as he exited his factory. The streets were beginning to empty, the sun would soon set and though no curfew had been implemented like he had wanted, most people had heeded his word of mouth warnings and stayed off the streets at night. He felt stares and could faintly hear the whispers, but he did not falter. He soon found himself standing before Portley-Rind's marvelous home, his left hand grasping the door knocker thus making his presence known. The butler, a rude little man named Chesire, promptly answered the door and greeted Archibald with his usual sneer. \"What business have you with my lord, Mayor Portley-Rind, Mr. Snatcher.\" Cheshire asked in his usual dry, uninterested tone. \"Lord Portly Rind is expecting me, having called upon me earlier this week sir.\" Archibald stated with a forced smile, reaching in his pocket with his good hand to provide proof. A letter from the lord was presented, and Cheshire paused to read it, most likely checking for forgery. \"Right this way then.\" He shoved the letter back to the guest and hurriedly led him up the stairs. Upon passing the tasting room, Archibald felt a familiar knot in his stomach. He followed the butler up the smaller set of stairs to the right of the tasting room, halfway down the corridor to a large set of doors. Cheshire knocked on the door, opening them when the booming voice of Lord Portley-Rind bid him in. Archibald removed his tall, crooked red hat as he entered the new room. Portley-Rind sat at his large desk, his chair swiveled away from his guest to look out the large ornate windows at the streets below. The tip of his feathered white hat over the top of his chair the only visible part of him. As Archibald approached he couldn't help but take in the décor all around him. Various paintings lined the walls, he recognized some as various landmarks throughout the city. Others were still life paintings depicting exotic cheeses. One painting caught his eye, different from the rest, an infant clothed in white sprawled out on a bearskin rug. Like the man who sat at his desk, the child in the painting had flaming red hair. His daughter, he recalled,having seen an article in the newspaper a few months back. \"Thank you for coming, Mr. Snatcher.\" Lord Portley-Rind greeted at last, albeit dryly. \"Please have a seat.\" As Archibald seated himself he heard the lord audibly gasp. \"Good Lord, what happened to your hand? Boxtroll bite you?\" He asked with a hearty chuckled as he twirled the end of his mustache. \"Heh, good one my lord,\" he forced himself to laugh along, \"not quite but I assure you I'm fine.\" \"We have much to discuss in only a short amount of time, as mayor you can only imagine how busy I am.\" \"Of course, Lord Portley-Rind. I have much to tell you as well, already I have begun to-\" \"Mr. Snatcher, please spare me your speeches about the dangers of the boxtrolls. You have already made me aware, as well anyone with ears!\" He sighed before continuing. \"Do not mistake me, I do want you to exterminate them. It's your reward I wish to speak about, I'd like you to reconsider. As I originally offered, I am prepared the pay you any price and money is-\" \"My lord! Your money is no good to me, I have already told you my heart's desire.\" Lord Portley-Rind rubbed his forehead with his gloved fingertips, clearly unsure of how to address the elephant in the room. \"You want a white hat, you want to be one of the elite. Why not just take my offer of wealth? Isn't that the perk you care for the most?\" \"My lord, are you expressing that you wish to back out of our agreement?\" Archibald asked with feigned shock. \"Yes, Mr. Snatcher. I spoke too soon, acted too hastily when you delivered such grim news that terrible night.\" \"Such a shame to hear that, it's rather discouraging. I want nothing more than to protect our fair city, to keep safe all those adorable children and delicious cheese reserves, but without a white hat…\" Archibald trailed off. \"You care only about status and power.\" \"As do you sir.\" There was a silence between them before Portley-Rind continued. \"A man such as yourself does not belong with men of prestige like myself. Even if were to exterminate all the boxtrolls, with proof I might add, earning your white hat does not earn you the acceptance or respect of my men or myself.\" Archibald felt his forced gleeful expression drop into a deep frown, disheartened at hearing words he already knew to be true. \"I want my white hat. I want to be on top, it is my destiny.\" \"So be it.\" The lord sneered leaning back in his chair, arms crossed firmly over his chest. \"Tell me then, what actions have you taken to keep my city safe?\" The exterminator perked up at this question, thin lips curling into a smile once more. \"Just this past week I've caught twelve boxtrolls. As I'm sure you know, boxtrolls are nocturnal. The streets of Cheesebridge are littered with these vile creatures at night, I would propose a curfew so no one is harmed by them. This would also allow my men and I to hunt them down safely.\" \"What men?\" The mayor scoffed. \"That crazed little man and yourself?\" \"Well…yes, currently it is only Mr. Gristle and myself. I am hiring more exterminators but it will take time. I've gotta find reliable men and train 'em to be their best.\" \"Assemble a reliable team of exterminators and I will consider it, but for now my answer is no. I believe we are done here.\" Portley-Rind dismissed the unwanted guest, who bid him farewell in the most lengthy way possible, as he always did. The mayor stood from his desk and approached a cabinet nearby, pulling out a glass and poured himself a glass of rum. Still massaging away his migraine as he drank. Archibald grumbled under his breath as he rushed through the streets, now sparsely populated as the sun began to set. As he walked down the beaten dirt path to his factory he couldn't help but look over at the river near by. It had been far too long since he last stopped to admire how the sunlight glistened upon the still surface of the river. For years he would come out on nice days and stare out at the body of water, his mind traveling but his eyes slowly taking in the sights around him. It had been even longer since he last went out on the river, his family's boat having fallen into decay before his tenth birthday. The decrepit remains of the boat still festered by the entrance to the factory, a monument to the few good times of his childhood. He sighed deeply and turned his back on the body of water, choosing instead to retreat back to his home, the family factory. Mr. Gristle eagerly greeted him a the door, like a dog left home alone. Archibald handed the man his hat and coat before seating himself at the table nearby. When Mr. Gristle came back he beckoned him to join him at the table to share with him their new task. \"Well Bernard, my friend, it seems that Portley-Rind has yet to take us seriously. But in time he will, he'll have no choice! We must assemble more men for a proper team, only then will he instill a curfew, and with a curfew the streets will be ours. You know what that means?\" \"Hunting!\" He exclaimed. \"Precisely! You can hunt around all you want, smash and thrash and no one gets hurt except for those filthy boxtrolls.\" \"Exterminate!\" \"Go get ready, curfew or not we still have work to do tonight.\" The man scurried off as instructed and Archibald mused about hiring exterminators, what men he would need for a team and how he would spread the word. An ad in the paper and posters around town seemed his best bet, though all were concerns for the next day. Just like Mr. Trubshaw.[Chapter 2] If you're square, you'd better beware! If you're brave, help send them to the grave! Join the Red Hat Exterminators! The slogan was splayed on each flier, accompanied by the silhouette of a boxtroll. It cost Archibald a good chunk of money, but he knew the posters would keep people fearful as well as grab the attention of new help. Several places had already turned him down, not wanting his fliers marring their walls or the weather worn exteriors of their establishments. Perhaps the wealthier side of town was not the best place to start, but Archibald was hopeful he would find at least one place to spread his posters. He tried the pub nearest his factory, the curator there uncaring of what he put on the walls. Anything to cover up the questionable stains. As he finished hanging up his third poster in the pub one individual in particular caught his eye. The man was hunched over a table in the corner, he chugged his ale as he sat alone, darkly glancing about the room. It was evident from his face that he had seen his fair share of fights. His left ear was missing part of the cartilage, as though it had been bitten off, his other was a permanent cauliflower ear. His nose was crooked, clearly broken, and his glaring eyes were dark and sunken. Despite how physically repulsive he was, it was his intimidating form and enormous bulky arms that drew Archibald closer. The man's eyes locked onto the exterminator who now seated himself across from him as though he were an old friend. \"Beat it.\" The brute grunted. \"I have no intention of leaving until you hear me out, good sir. My name is Archibald Snatcher, I am the owner of the Red Hat Extermination company. Perhaps you've heard of it and our mission to relieve this fine city of it's boxtroll infestation?\" \"I said leave.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"You seem like the fighting type, eager to get your hands dirty. You'd be perfect for my team of exterminators, would you be interested in the job?\" \"Take your job and shove it.\" Archibald stood then, intent on returning the insult. The grotesque man too stood, cracking his knuckles and baring the crooked teeth he hadn't yet lost in brawls. \"Bah! Never mind, you are not worth my time.\" Archibald spat, taking his stack of fliers and leaving the man. There were plenty of other prospective employees somewhere in Cheesebridge, he would just have to wait for them to notice the posters and come to him. A job as noble and heroic as this would have men begging to be on the team. So he waited, and he waited. The trepidation of two weeks with no responses began to sink in. He had to get the public's attention somehow. For the first time in months he thought back to his childhood acting career. In retrospect, it wasn't nearly as glamorous as his naive child mind had believed it was. It was difficult, tedious work and though he was desperate and didn't care at the time, he was also paid very little. Despite how crummy it was, he still had many fond memories of those times. When the acting troupe first came to Cheesebridge they had performances every weekend. Archibald's father would not allow him to go, claiming it was a foolish waste of time, not something any respectable man would enjoy. That would not stop him from going alone. He would sneak away as his father slept off his hangovers, being sure to return before he woke up. They performed in the town square for all to see, a variety of different shows entertaining for all ages. He never missed a show, he could recite the lines of his favorite scenes by heart. This did not go unnoticed by the leader of the acting troupe, a man named Mr. Holden. The kind gentleman offered him a chance to join the other actors on stage, it was an opportunity he had only dreamed of, one he did not pass up. Though there was a catch; Archibald's youthful voice and appearance were perfect for female roles. Mr. Holden had assured him these roles were commonly played by young men, despite his initial reluctance he accepted. In time he had lost his stage fright, becoming quite comfortable in the dresses and makeup he wore. He would act, sing and dance in his drag and he was good at it. He felt good doing it. After all the time and effort he put into honing his talents, he hadn't used them after his father found out where the money came from. Archibald retrieved himself from his memories, not wanting to delve any deeper into his childhood. His short lived acting career was one of many things his father wasn't proud if, just like his horrific cheese allergy. Regardless, his memories did spark an idea in him. A crazy idea, but the only one he had. With some practice, perhaps he could take up his forgotten talents of acting and singing to use them to further warn the people of the boxtroll menace and advertise employment. Though no one would ever want to see Archibald Snatcher on stage, Lord Portley-Rind would certainly not be impressed. The factory was empty, as Mr. Gristle still had not returned from posting more fliers throughout the city. He sucked in a lungful of air before his lips parted, but produced no sound. Clearing his throat he tried again, reciting the vocal exercises his old teacher made him do before each performance. The higher his voice went the more it quivered and cracked. He tried to sing what lyrics he remembered from his favorite musical performances, words once familiar now foreign to him. With each attempt he felt more disappointment with himself, his talents seemingly forever lost to him. His stomach rumbled, stirring him from his practice. If he was going to fix a meal he would need to make extra for his guest in the cellar. A mere hour later he was bringing down a tray with two bowls of stew to share with Herbert. Archibald had previously promised himself he would not go down into the basement without Mr. Gristle after last time. He figured there was no harm this time, he would be on his guard so there would be no further outbursts. Also having stew for lunch meant there would not be a fork for him to attack with, only a spoon. A tiny spoon. The small size did not stop Herbert from shoveling spoonful after spoonful in his mouth, hardly waiting for the stew to cool. Archibald could only watch on silently in disgust, stirring his own bowl as he felt his appetite fade. He considered trying once more to convince his prisoner to cooperate, though such negotiations were best saved for when Mr. Gristle was present as his backup. \"I heard you singing up there.\" Mr. Trubshaw said after he finished his stew. \"Did you now?\" Archibald paused before adding, \"What did you think?\" \"Terrible.\" \"Ah.\" Herbert leaned back in his seat crossing his arms and closing his eyes, lost in his own thoughts. \"One of the songs sounded familiar, I believe Emily sang it for me once.\" Emily. Archibald felt his heart sink to his stomach at the mention of her name. A woman whose voice he too had once heard carry a tune. A woman who bore so much kindness, she made Cheesebridge a more bearable. A woman who chose wrong. \"First I lost my wife Emily, then our little Arthur, I no longer have a family.\" Herbert opened his eyes to allow tears to escape. \"All of which is your own fault, Trubshaw.\" Archibald hissed as he rose from his seat. Herbert glared up at him as he continued. \"It was your foul seed that killed her! You should be happy the brat's gone, thanking me for that! If only the rumors I've spread about the boxtrolls eating babies were true.\" Herbert sprung from his seat, connecting his fist with Archibald's jaw. He stumbled backwards reeling from the impact, but Herbert's rage did not stop there. The inventor pounced on him, pinning him to the ground as his fists rained on him. Archibald barely had enough time to shield himself from the blows, thrashing under Herbert to shake him off. Herbert lost his balance toppling over and sat on the ground breathless, the fatigue overcoming him. Still on the ground, Archibald scrambled away from him, keeping as much distance between them as possible. Herbert slumped over on his side, curling up into a ball, covering his face as he openly bawled. His whole body shook as his wails filled the cellar. Archibald cautiously approached his prisoner, grabbing his hands away from his face and dragging him into his cage by his arms. With the cage locked he turned off the lights and left Herbert to fester in the darkness. He lumbered up the stairs, his body aching but his mind numb. Mr. Gristle finally returned just as the entrance was sealed off. \"Posters done!\" Mr. Gristle announced as he approached his boss. \"Good.\" Archibald muttered as he held his aching jaw. \"Boss hurt?\" The little man exclaimed, with glee rather than concern. \"No. I'm going to rest until tonight, get ready in the meantime.\" \"Hunting!\" He he squealed as he ran off to complete his task. Once on the upper level of his factory, where both his bedroom and his office resided, Archibald was able to assess the damage dealt to him. He cringed at his reflection in his vanity mirror. His face red and swollen, his left eye blackened, a trickle of blood seeped from his lip and his knuckles were also tinged with blood. He sighed and laid in his bed, closing his eyes as he felt tears began to well up. He thought not of his conflict with Herbert, but rather the cause; Emily. He let his tears flow freely down his face as memories he tried so hard to forget flooded his mind until sleep finally overcame him.

He was there with Eggs, Shoe, Winnie, and Mr. Trubshaw. They were seated in chairs, while the boxtroll stood. His eyes drawn to the second floor of the mansion where screams could be heard. Mandy Chambers the former heiress of the Chamber family and the wife/mate of Fish the boxtroll was in labor. The pain in her abdomen began early this morning, Mandy brushed it off and continued on with the day. But, it wasn't until that evening it turned into a contraction. Worried and very afraid Fish along with Shoe and Eggs helped Mandy into the city to the Portley-Rind residence. They were greeted by Mandy's uncle: Lord Portley-Rind and she was escorted to a guest bedroom by a few female servants and a doctor. Eventually, Winnie arrived with Mr. Trubshaw who informed Fish that the other boxtrolls knew what was happening and were making preparations. Three hours, had gone by and Fish was a nervous wreck. Eggs and Winnie noticed but didn't know what to say to comfort the boxtroll. After all they were just kids and knew nothing of where babies came from. But, by the sound of Mandy's screams they assumed it wasn't a pleasant place. \"I'm never having children.\" Winnie whispered to Eggs. He nodded in agreement and turned his attention back to his fatherly figure. Regardless of what was happening, Eggs did feel excited. He was going to be a big brother to a new baby boy or girl. Personally, Eggs didn't care, but Winnie did. The outspoken young girl was hoping the baby would be female, that way she could become a role model to the child. While the children had positive thoughts on the subject, Fish was another story. He was concerned for Mandy and the baby at the moment. The baby's gender, the troll could care less. Fish just wanted a healthy, happy baby and his mate to not be in pain. Her screams motivated his natural instincts to protect his mate and child from harm. When boxtrolls did this they bear their teeth and keep all threats away until their mate has the child. His brothers no longer did this since there were no females around anymore and they held a good grasp on their instinctive nature (some more than others). Fish kept composure and continued to pace, even as Lord Portley-Rind joined everyone in the lobby. Upon hearing a scream from Mandy, the lord smiled and let out a chuckle catching Fish's attention. \"That takes me back.\" He stated taking a glance at his daughter. \"So, um...Fish is it? Do you have a name for my grand-niece or nephew?\" Portley-Rind asked. \"I think it should be named Jelly!\" Trubshaw shouted jumping from his chair and smiling. \"It's a perfect name for a boy or a girl.\" Winnie frowned. \"There is no way, my cousin will be named Jelly!\" she said as Trubshaw gave her a questioning look before Eggs intervened. \"What she means is…Fish meant have one picked out already. Isn't that right?\" he said as all eyes were on the boxtroll. \"Olives.\" Fish muttered rubbing his knuckles. Everyone smiled shaking their heads at the name. \"Heh, I still like Jelly.\" Trubshaw stated pulling out a jar with a spoon. After a few minutes, the screaming stopped and the cry of the newborn echoed the walls of the mansion. The cry made Fish stop, instinct telling him that his child had arrived. The doors upstairs opened and a maid ran out.\" It's here!\" she yelled in excitement. Everyone stood with smiles on their faces, Eggs stood next to Fish placing a hand on the boxtroll's shoulder. \"The father must come up first then we will call for the others.\" Fish gulped and ascended the grand staircase to the nurse who beckoned him to follow her down a long hallway. He kept his eyes to the floors as thoughts ran through his head. By the cry, his baby was fine, but how was Mandy? \"Fish\" a small voice said as the boxtroll looked up to see Mandy. She positioned on the bed with a pile of blanket in her hand. The boxtroll ran over to the side of the bed as Mandy leaned down so their lips could meet. He gently placed his hands on her face as they kissed, his worries finally settled. A whimper broke their kiss and Mandy moved over in the bed allowing Fish to sit as she handed him the child. \"Meet your daughter.\" She said smiling and allowing her head lay back on the pillow. Fish with wide eyes gazed down at the tiny bundle. She looked human, but her tone was a light green similar to a boxtroll. Her ears were pointed, but she did have five fingers and ten toes. In addition, the baby had soft pink cheeks which moved slightly when she gurgled. Fish stroked her head seeing a patch of Mandy's brown curls, he smiled when her glowing brown met his own. She would be able to see in the dark, which meant the baby could come with him to scavenge, once she was older. The baby stared at Fish then reached her hands to touch his box, with her small hands she beat it like a drum. Mandy giggled, while Fish held the child close so very proud. \"Just so you know I didn't name her yet. You insisted on doing so.\" Mandy said. Fish turned to his mate, a look of love shining in his brown eyes. \"Olives.\" Fish muttered waiting for Mandy protest against it. To his surprise, the brunette eyed her daughter. She was busy sucking one of Fish's fingers, the boxtroll took his finger from her and began rocking the toddler while humming. \"Believe or not, I like the name. Olives Winifred Chambers.\" Mandy muttered as Fish leaned forward licking her cheek in gratitude. \"Thank you Mandy.\" He said, she smiled before a pout appeared on her face. \"Fish I believe you missed a spot.\" The boxtroll gave her a confused look before she collided their lips again. Their hearts pounded violently as they kissed. Mandy moved her lips more into his, outstretching her hands to engulf both her husband and child. Fish kissed her carefully, being mindful of their newborn and resisting the urge to give into natural instinct which is how they created Olives. Fish pulled away when he heard the rest of their family walking into the room. Mandy pouted, but Fish reassured his mate with a quick lick to her lips. She blushed just as everyone walked inside. \"Oh, how adorable!\" Winnie yelled viewing the baby. Eggs walked alongside her, nervous when Olive's eyes met his own. \"Oh, hello. I'm Eggs, your brother.\" He said. The baby smiled and reached out for Eggs. Fish carefully set her in his arms as Winnie guided him. \"Hold her head and bring her close.\" Winne instructed, while cooing the baby. \"I give my congratulations to you both! What a beautiful child!\" Lord Portly-Rind said shaking Fish's hand. Trubshaw was on the other side of the bed embracing Mandy. With a sigh, she buried her face into her father-figure's chest.\" You did a good job Mandy, I'm so proud. But I still would have wanted her to be named Jelly.\" He said low enough so Fish couldn't hear. Mandy giggled and turned to Eggs and Winnie. Olives was trying to grab Eggs' hair while Winnie was making silly faces to distract her younger cousin. \"Alright, you three that's enough. I think it's time for Olives Winifred to have a nap.\" Winnie squealed excitedly, happy Mandy had used her name for Olives. Eggs gave Olives back to Mandy, she whined at being separated from her brother. \"Be calm dear, they will be here in the morning.\" Mandy assured kissing her forehead and settling the baby in the crib beside her. With a yawn, Olives was asleep and everyone was walking out. It was late, Eggs and Trubshaw left to tell the trolls of the new arrival since Shoe had fallen asleep prior. Winne hugged Mandy and kissed Olives forehead before walking out with her father. Fish was beside the crib hypnotized by the movements of his newborn. He watched her chest rise and fall while stroking the tips of her nails. Mandy shifted in her bed lowering the light of the lamp in the room. \"Fish, she'll still be there in the morning. Now come to bed.\" The boxtroll did as he was told and kissed Mandy before going inside his box for the night.

She had wonderful news to discuss, and she could not wait another moment longer. She finally spotted her friend with her bosses' daughter, Winifred Portley-Rind, who she nannied. They appeared to be on their daily stroll through town. Molly politely pushed her way through the crowd over to the pair. \"Pardon me, excuse me sir, I just need to get through… YOOHOO! Ms. Pepper! It's me, Molly!\" she shouted over the heads of the townsfolk. Pepper heard the shrill voice of her companion and let out a groan. Molly sounded happy, this was usually a bad sign for the bitter and pessimistic nanny. Winnie, on the other hand, was happy to hear Ms. Monte Cristo coming. She appreciated her wit and charm. \"Oh! Good morning Ms. Monte Cristo!\" she greeted kindly. Molly adjusted her dress after getting through the crowded marketplace and smiled warmly at the two. \"Good morning, Ms. Portley-Rind! I hope you two are having a fine morning.\" \"Actually, breakfast was rather-\" Pepper began to complain, but Molly cut her off, \"I know I have been having a SMASHING morning myself!\" She pulled a folded piece of paper out from her bosoms and showed it off to the girls. \"I got a letter.\" \"So what? I get a letter from my sister about once a month. Never care to read'em though.\" Pepper shrugged. \"Ah, ah, ah! This is not just any letter. Its a LOVE LETTER!\" Molly hugged the piece of paper tightly, and batted her eyes romantically. \"Oh! From Mr. Pickles?\" Winnie asked hopefully. Everyone knew Mr. Pickles and Ms. Molly were desperately in love with each other, but too oblivious to see it themselves. The blonde shook her head, \"I don't know, Its anonymous.\" \"Its probably Mr. Pickles.\" Pepper rolled her eyes. Who else would write a love letter to Molly? As beautiful as she was, none of the men in Cheesebridge could get past her bold personality. Not that she was bad, she was just not the kind of lady-like, obedient, wife material, that most modern men were looking for. \"I said I don't know!\" she snapped back, \"but it is a nice idea.\" she quickly fell back into her dreamy daze. Unfortunately, Winnie had to roll her eyes along with her nanny. It had been almost ten years since Molly and Mr. Pickles met, and at this point they were just wasting time. Molly cleared her throat as she prepared to read her love letter aloud. \"Dear Ms. Molly,\" she paused, \"Thats me!\" Her two listeners rolled their eyes once more, \"Words could not describe how I feel for you. When I see you my heart leaps to the high heavens because it feels as though it has just seen an angel! Your hair is as bright as your halo, and your eyes are as green as the tall, thin, grass that flows gently with the breeze. A breeze similar to the one that blew by when I met you. I remember it so well. Never had I seen a lady so prominent and unique, like no one I had ever met before! A vision! An empress! You are my moon, my sun, and my stars, and I cannot live much longer without you. Someday I will hold you in my arms and then I will be content with life and i will never need another drink of water, another bite of food, another ray of sunshine, because you are all I need. My dear Molly. Love your SECRET ADMIRER!\" She squealed with delight at the end. \"That sure was something…\" Pepper nodded. Winnie agreed. Both of them were unsure of what to think. That poem was good. Too good to be Mr. Pickles'. Perhaps Molly really did have a new secret admirer. The cogs in Winnie's head were turning, and she knew what she had to do to save Mr. Pickles and Molly's relationship from this imposing new threat. \"That was lovely, Ms. Monte Cristo! True poetry! Now if you'll excuse us, Ms. Pepper and i have some very important business to attend to. I hope you have a wonderful day, and I hope you discover who this secret admirer of yours is!\" She took her nanny by the hand and began pulling her through the marketplace as quickly as possible, without even giving the blonde lovestruck woman a chance to bid farewell. \"For once, I am glad you dragged me out of a conversation.\" Pepper admitted to the girl, \"All that lovey-dovey, mushy-gushy, gunk makes me sick.\" She shuddered at the thought of that poem, and felt grateful that she had no secret admirers to leave her disgusting letters like that. Winnie pulled Pepper far away from the Market place, about halfway downtown, when she began to explain her idea. \"We have to plan the perfect date for Mr. Pickles and Ms. Molly to confess their love to each other, before some other creep swipes her out from underneath his giant nose!\" Pepper stopped in her tracks and shook Winnie's grip from of her hand, \"Hold on, hold on! First of all, this is none of our business! And secondly, how are we so sure that wasn't Mr. Pickles' letter?\" Winnie cocked an eyebrow, \"Were we listening to the same poem?\" \"Alright, good point…\" Pepper admitted. So the two made their way down to the old Red Hat factory to discuss date plans with Mr. Pickles. Upon arriving he was coincidentally getting ready to depart to go see Molly. \"Oh, good day ladies! What brings you down here today?\" he asked politely. \"I have TERRIBLE news!\" Winnie stated dramatically, \"Someone has given Ms. Molly an anonymous love letter!\" Mr. Pickles smiled, and looked around to make sure Molly wasn't accompanying them. He then leaned in and whispered, \"I am that admirer, believe it or not! I left a love letter in her mail slot early this morning.\" He felt proud hearing the news from her friends; she was already out and about telling everyone about the poem he stayed up all night writing. Pepper shook her head, \"There is no way you wrote that poem.\" \"Oh no?\" Mr. Pickles cleared his throat, and recited, \"Hair as yellow as cheese glistening in the sun, eyes as green as grass, you are like an angel with no wings-\" Pepper shook her head, \"Nope. Not the same poem.\" Mr. Pickles paused abruptly, \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Ms. Molly's poem was different, it was more articulate, more romantic-\" \"It was more GOOD.\" Winnie blurted. She stood up on a wooden chair to be at eye level with the tall man, although she still didn't quite meet his gaze, \"You have competition now. If you want to win Molly's heart you have to really show her. Without being so secretive.\" \"Someone else? In love? With Ms. Molly?\" Mr. Pickles couldn't believe it. Well he could, considering Molly was such a catch, but he couldn't believe that he had to compete for Molly's affections. He knew that he couldn't compare to anyone else, Molly would surely never pick him. Winnie continued blabbering on, even though Mr. Pickles was clearly on another train of thought, \"I think we should plan an elaborate, romantic, huge date! I can see it now… You and Molly alone under the moonlight after the perfect moment alone and then you tell her your feelings and she tells you hers! And we'll all be there to make sure it goes according to plan.\" She leaned over to Pepper and whispered, \"So we can assure that this time he won't mess it up.\" Pepper couldn't help but crack a smile at the jab. Mr. Pickles snapped back into the moment, \"What? I don't- I wasn't- Whats happening?\" \"You don't have to worry about a thing, Mr. Pickles. All you have to do is invite Ms. Molly over to the factory instead of having your usual Tuesday tea, and we will have the entire factory decorated for an elaborate date night for two. There will be no way you could mess this up, because you won't have to put together any of it.\" Mr. Trout stepped into the room, but already heard everything. \"Uh, we ?\" \"Yes! You, Ms. Pepper, Eggs and the other boxtrolls, and I!\" Pepper's eyes widened when she heard her name, \"Oh, no, no, no, no! I am not a party planner, nor a party goer. And i certainly do not want to be part of any harebrained scheme that involves Molly or Mr. Pickles. I've been there before and I vowed I would never be there again.\" \"This isn't their harebrained scheme, its mine! And if everyone does exactly as I say, then it should go perfectly! Besides you don't have to do any planning, you will be the waitress.\" \"Waitress?\" The lady groaned. She hated this date idea the more and more it was discussed. Mr. Pickles wasn't so sure about all of this either, \"I- I don't know. Are you sure this is a good idea, Ms. Winnifred?\" Winnie put her hands on his shoulders and looked him in the eyes, \"I promise you that after this perfect date night you and Ms. Molly will be the most adored couple in Cheesebridge. And you will have no one but me to thank for that!\" she nodded. Mr. Pickles was still unsure, but he agreed. The day was spent planning a romantic evening and decorating the factory to look like a fancy evening restaurant. With the boxtrolls help, it got done in no time. They hung handmade banners and streamers all around, and accented the room with lovely flowers they found around town, and some the boxtrolls had even grew themselves in their gardens. Winnie \"borrowed\" some expensive cheese from her father, and some other fine foods from the Portley-Rind kitchen for Mr. Trout to cook an exquisite meal. Mr. Pickles watched everything practically fly by, and grew more and more nervous by the minute. He always had a small idea of what the perfect moment with Molly would be, and to be quite honest he had that moment in his grasp many times, but he always let it slip. Maybe it was a good idea to let someone else have control over the situation. He tossed the ideas around in his head until it was finally time to go retrieve Molly. Winnie looked around the room, extremely pleased with her handiwork. She was proud of everyone involved, but mostly herself. Mr. Pickles took one look around the factory and couldn't help but feel like everything was far too overdone. It wasn't the setting he ever imagined confessing his love to Ms. Molly in, and he had a lot of scenarios in mind, but as nice as this all was, it was not one of those settings. The doubts began to settle in as he tossed more ideas back and forth in his head. Winnie gave the tall man a small pep talk before sending him to fetch Molly. \"Now don't give any of this away. All you have to do is ask her to have tea at the factory instead of her house. Tell her you bought some special new tea straight from Italy or something, anything to get her down her without giving away the surprise.\" Mr. Pickles nodded at the instructions, but everything she said to him was in-one-ear-and-out-the-other to him. Mr. Pickles left the factory and ventured up the hill as everyone put the final touches on the date scene. As Mr. Trout was cooking up an appetizer of his own creation, Ms. Pepper chatted with him about Molly's other secret admirer. \"You should have heard that poem. It was so gross! 'You are my moon, my sun, and my stars! I can't live much longer without you!' Bleh!\" she mocked Molly's tone from earlier. Mr. Trout recognized the words immediately, \"Oh! That was Mr. Pickles' love letter.\" \"WHAT? Bu- But he said his was different.\" \"Yeah, well he fell asleep and I read his letter and it was bad… So I, uh, changed a few things.\" Mr. Trout began to feel the guilt settle in as he focused his eyes on the pan before him. Pepper eyed him with an icy stare, \"How many things?\" \"The whole thing.\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Oh, cheese and crackers.\" she pinched her nose at the absurdity of the whole situation. \"You mean to tell me that we practically sprinted downtown today for no real reason? All of this is nothing now? Everything is exactly the same as it was before? There is no one else in love with Ms. Molly?\" The tiny woman could feel her anger boiling inside her like a kettle. Her day was wasted yet again on another infamous Cheesebridge harebrained scheme. \"Well we don't know that-\" \"You know what I mean! Don't get clever with me!\" Mr. Trout cracked a smile at Pepper's temper. Although he had to agree that this whole misunderstanding was disruptive to his usual daily routine. He would be painting right now, but cooking wasn't too bad either. At least he was spending time with Ms. Pepper. Meanwhile Mr. Pickles was making the grueling trip uptown to retrieve Ms. Molly. The closer he got the shakier he felt, the more doubts he concocted, and the more he worried about this other mystery admirer. Once he reached her front door he wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead and knocked hesitantly. He adjusted his scarf as he heard her heels approaching. With one last gulp, the door swung open to reveal the love of his life. \"Ah! You are here, splendid! I have some fresh tea brewing and I bought some special biscuits at the market place today if you'd like to have some.\" \"A- Actually, Ms. Molly- uh thank you for the trouble, but I was wondering if you would like to perhaps have today's tea down at the factory?\" He fiddled with his hands anxiously as he awaited her answer. He was never good at keeping secrets, and it was taking a lot of control for him to not blurt out this one. Molly paused for a moment, he had never made an offer like this before. She was surprised he didn't just call her; he usually did that when he couldn't make it. \"Oh, but you've already walked all the way up here and i'm sure you are very tired from doing so. Wouldn't you much rather stay here?\" Mr. Pickles wasn't sure how to conceal the secret without giving even the smallest hint away, so instead he blurted out, \"No. Let's go.\" Molly was shocked by this remark, but shrugged it off with a smile, finding his spontaneity endearing. She grabbed a small basket filled with the biscuits, her fan, and a few other things, and they began their trip down to the factory. It was already past sunset as they ventured down the street quietly, and the farther they went the more the moon began to shine. They reached a spot in Cheesebridge that overlooked the river and the factory, and stopped to take a small rest. Molly saw this as a perfect opportunity to give something special to Mr. Pickles. \"I have a gift for you.\" she said as she rummaged through her basket. Mr. Pickles was surprised, it wasn't any special occasion, what kind of gift could this possibly be? She pulled a book out of her basket, and began to explain, \"I was sorting through my father's library with him, as we were donating some old books to the schoolhouse and the library, when I found this book about the universe.\" She opened it to the table of contents, \"Its got all kinds of things about planets, and science, and philosophy, but here is the part that really made me think of you!\" She flipped open to a page that was just a large illustration of the stars and constellations all graphed out. \"See! Its all those constellations and stars you keep telling me about. Now you can really look at them and find them.\" She handed him the book to skim. As he flipped through she put her hands behind her back and rocked on her feet shyly, \"I don't care much for science or philosophy, but I know how much it sparks your imagination and I thought you would really enjoy this. Although i'm sure you probably already have plenty of books on these subjects, so if anything this is just another addition to the collection.\" Mr. Pickles was flabbergasted. This was quite possibly the most thoughtful gift anyone had ever given him. And the most spontaneous. He was speechless, but Molly was awaiting a response, so he muttered, \"Th- Thank you.\" He cleared his throat and spoke more clearly, \"Thank you very much, Ms. Molly. This is very kind of you.\" She lifted her shoulders and felt her cheeks glowing. \"I knew you would like it.\" Mr. Pickles closed the book and just stared at this woman. This perfect, beautiful, strong, intelligent, wonderful woman. She was the first person he could recall to ever give him such a gift just out of the kindness of her heart, because she found something and thought of him. His head felt clear, and for the first time in ten years he finally thought, \"Maybe Ms. Molly really does love me.\" \"There is something I need to tell you, Ms. Molly. Something I've wanted to say for a very long time.\" Molly looked up at him hopefully, a glimmer in her green eyes. He continued, for once feeling confident about what he had to say, \"I have very strong feelings…. For you. We- We've known each other for about ten years and ever since I first met you i've felt like you were something different. I've never met anyone like you before in my whole life. I guess what i'm trying to say is I think i'm- i'm in l- love with you.\" It was silent as Molly soaked up the words she had been waiting to hear for ten years. Mr. Pickles took a moment to breath, amazed that he finally got it all off of his chest, and so clearly. The two were so astounded by the whole speech, as small as it was, that they just needed the moment to process it all. Molly finally spoke up, \"I have felt the same about you for ten years.\" she admitted confidently as well, \"And I have been with other men before, but none come as close to perfect as you do.\" Mr. Pickles hesitated, \"So you love me too?\" Molly giggled, \"Oh, I am head over heels in love with you, Mr. Pickles!\" His face grew the biggest smile after hearing those words. The words he never thought he would hear escape Molly's lips, but tonight they did. The two of them were so overjoyed that they just burst into a fit of laughter. A laughter that rang through the town like a bell that could be heard in every dark alley as a beacon of hope for any lost soul who ever thought they were unlovable, unwanted, or never good enough for someone. The laughter of two people who felt so silly wasting so much time on anxieties that were never even true. And none of it even mattered anymore. \"Haha, so what do we do now?\" Mr. Pickles asked, actually very unsure how to continue his life knowing somebody loved him the way she did. Molly cleared her throat, \"Well, I think now it would be an appropriate time to share a kiss.\" she stated boldly. \"A kiss?\" Mr. Pickles froze up. Things suddenly felt like they were moving fast. You know someone for ten years and now suddenly you're admitting your love and kissing all in one night. Molly nodded, hoping he would agree. \"I suppose that is appropriate a time as ever.\" he admitted. The two stepped closer to one another. Molly was beaming, whilst Mr. Pickles smile reverted back to his usual nervous furrow. Molly closed her eyes and leaned in first. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, giving her a small peck on the lips. They parted quickly and took in the moment once more. Both of them felt butterflies inside of them. Neither had been kissed in so long that it felt almost unfamiliar. \"That was nice.\" Molly piped up. Mr. Pickles nodded in agreement, unable to muster up even a simple word. They looked at each other dead in the eyes, and is if they were communicating telepathically, they grabbed each other in for a much more passionate embrace and kiss. Back at the factory, Winnie was enraged that Pickles and Molly were not back already, and sent a search party out to find them, consisting of herself, Eggs, and Ms. Pepper. \"How much do you wanna bet that Mr. Pickles chickened out and just stayed at Molly's for tea?\" Winnie grumbled as they marched up town in a line. Pepper shrugged, \"Or maybe he just chickened out and ran away.\" She smiled at the idea of no more Mr. Pickles in her life. One less imbecile she'd have to deal with in this town. Eggs followed along the ladies unsure of what was going on. He honestly just liked spending time with everyone. The trio heard a noise from around the corner of a building, and peaked around the corner carefully to see. It was Molly and Mr. Pickles. Winnie gasped, \"There they-\" but Ms. Pepper shushed her quickly. As she observed the two, she could tell there was something different about their dynamic. They seemed closer, lighter, less nervous than usual. As they spied on the two for a minute longer, they noticed Mr. Pickles place an arm around Molly without any hesitation. Now Ms. Pepper gasped. \"They did it…\" \"Did what?\" blurted Eggs. The girls shushed him and he crouched down as if to hide in his box. Although Winnie was on Eggs' side for this argument, \"They did what?\" she repeated quietly. \"They confessed their love.\" Pepper whispered. \"WHAT?!\" Winnie whisper yelled, \"This is NOT how it was supposed to happen! It was supposed to be in my romantic candlelit ballroom factory dinner scene! I worked hard on that, and they don't even know its there! Well, she doesn't. He knows full well we are waiting for him-\" Pepper placed her hand over Winnie's mouth to quiet her down. Pepper spoke quietly and seriously, \"That doesn't matter. All that matters is that those two idiots finally did it.\" There was a silence as Winnie shook Pepper's hand from her mouth and pouted, crossing her arms in front of her. The nanny spoke up one last time, \"I'm happy for them.\" \"You always said you pitied them.\" Eggs chimed in. Pepper sighed, \"Oh, I do, but they deserve each other. I think they're going to be much happier from now on. Much to my annoyance.\" She imagined the future before her. No more stupid secret love stories, or pathetic excuses. Now she would be stuck with much gushy PDA and stupid public love stories. She couldn't decide which was worse. Eggs tapped his fingers on the building, \"So if they're not going to eat any of that food back at the factory, can we eat it instead?\" he asked. The two girls looked at each other, Winnie giving her nanny a cheeky grin. The girl then began to bolt back up the road, \"Only if you can beat me there and eat it all first!\" Eggs laughed as he ran to catch up with Winnie. Pepper followed behind, giving one last glance at the new couple on their first real date. She smiled genuinely. As much as she hated to admit it, she was happy for them. Their new life was about to begin. ","Summary":" Molly was practically skipping through the market place as she searched for her dear friend Pepper."},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Nanny Business","Author":"OriginalSharkBiteGal","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11545915","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Cheesebridge had become a much more accepting town after realizing the Boxtrolls were indeed not monsters. Everything seemed to be looking up for everyone. One concerned parent however was worried about his child. Lord Portley-Rind never payed much attention to his one and only daughter Winifred, but after the events in town and realizing how much he neglected her, he now switched into an almost overprotective mode. He would watch as Winnie went out and played with the Boxtrolls and her friend Eggs and thought about how unsafe the streets of Cheesebridge really were. Pondering the problem and a way to solve it, he decided that the best thing to do was to hire a nanny to watch over his darling daughter. That way while he was busy with his business and his wife was busy with her social life, Winnie would still be safe and under careful supervision. He knocked on his daughters door one morning as she lay sleeping in her bed. \"Winifred, are you up, dear?\" he asked quietly as he poked his head into her room. The young girl rubbed her eyes as she sat up in bed. She stretched her arms and yawned before answering, \"I am now. Morning father!\" She smiled, thinking about how great things had been since her father payed more attention to her. All she ever wanted was for her dad to notice her, and now that he finally did everything seemed perfect, and she hoped it would stay that way forever. As the Lord saw his daughter up in her bed all bright eyed and bushy tailed as usual, he stepped inside placing his hands behind his back and beginning to almost rock on his heels anxiously. \"I have some very exciting news for you, my little angel!\" Winnie leaned forward ready to listen. Her father cleared his throat before starting, \"I have been thinking about how things have changed these last few months, and as your father I am always concerned for your well-being. Seeing you out and about all over town playing around with those Boxtrolls and that Egg boy, I get very worried. They are rather… Rough.\" Winnie rolled her eyes, but still kept a smile on her face. The only downside to her father noticing her now was that he became a bit protective. He saw her as his fragile, proper, little lady. He didn't like the idea of her playing in the dirt and throwing bugs around or possibly eating them. As many times as she tried to assure him that it was fine, he was still skeptical. \"So that is why I have hired a nanny to look after you!\" Portley-Rind gestured to the door and in marched a very small woman with dark brown hair wrapped up into a thick bun. Her outfit looked more like a maid than a nanny, and the uniform seemed as if it was one size too big for her. She had a very stern look on her face, as if she was annoyed with everything and everyone around her. She nodded her head towards Winnie as if to say hello. Winnie's face fell instantly. This happened so suddenly and without warning, she wasn't sure what to say or do. Her first instinct was too be angry. She quickly stood up on her bed and announced her feelings, \"I don't need a nanny!\" Her hands were balled into little fists at her side as she stood her ground and stared daggers at the woman before her. The lady seemed unfazed. \"Oh, but you do, darling! When your mother and I aren't around to watch you, the nanny here will make sure you stay safe and out of harms way. Isn't that right, Ms…\" he trailed, forgetting her name. The lady refrained from rolling her eyes at her new boss as she finished, \"Pepper, sir.\" \"Yes, yes, of course.\" he said as he patted her back. The lady's eyes shot open, surprised by the contact. He pushed her forward a bit as he slipped past her and back out the door. \"You two aquatint yourselves, I must be off. Important town business to discuss in the tasting room today. Good day, ladies!\" He shut the door behind him, and both Winnie and Pepper rolled their eyes. Winnie hopped off the bed and approached the new nanny. She stood only under a foot shorter than the grown woman. \"I don't need a nanny. I'm nearly twelve years old! I can take care of myself, thank you!\" she turned away from the woman and crossed her arms, sticking her nose in the air. Ms. Pepper was not very keen on the idea of being a nanny. It was either this or prostitution, and she was starting to wonder if she had chosen the wrong career. \"Look, I don't want to really be here either, so why don't you be a good little girl and get dressed, brush your teeth, and i'll whip you up a nice breakfast. Alright?\" her tone seemed condescending as she stood over Winnie with an incredibly fake and sarcastic smile on her face. None of this went over the young girl's head, she was smart; Smarter than most of the adults in Cheesebridge anyway. She did what she was told though, and tried to think of a way out of it whilst Pepper wasn't around. After she was dressed she made her way down to the dining room and sat at the head of the table. Not even a moment later Ms. Pepper brought in her breakfast: a cheese omelet with strawberries and blueberries on the side. \"Eat up.\" she said as she set it on the table. The girl began eating as her new nanny stood beside her staring at the wall. Winnie thought for a moment, then sighed. \"Do you really want to follow me around all day? I don't even do anything that spectacular. My days are pretty boring actually.\" she lied. Every day was an adventure when she was with Eggs and the Boxtrolls, but with all this nanny business in the way she could lose out on all the great opportunities. \"Your father told me to watch over you and make sure you don't get into trouble. If you do I am to bring you straight back home, and I get my paycheck.\" Winnie huffed and sunk in her chair. This lady was tough, no wonder her father chose her for the position. Another idea then popped into her head, and she sat back up and finished her meal. \"Alright, I'm full! Now how about we go out for a nice walk.\" she stood up quickly and began making her way to the front door of the house. Pepper shrugged and followed the girl closely. As they stepped out and down the steps of the Portley-Rind mansion, they were quickly swept into the busy marketplace of Cheesebridge. Winnie payed close attention to make sure Pepper was still behind her. She was, and she was not struggling as bad as she expected. Being so small she could maneuver through a crowd pretty well. Winnie searched the crowd for someone to talk to, to distract Ms. Pepper, but who? Then she spotted the perfect specimen. \"Ms. Monte Cristo!\" she waved her arms to get the tall woman's attention. A lady with big, golden hair and a fancy dress turned at the sound of her name being called. She looked around for a moment then found Winifred approaching her. \"Ah, Ms. Portley-Rind! How are you today?\" Compared to both Winnie and Pepper, this woman was an oak tree. A very tall and busty woman with bright green eyes and a smile that was as bright as the sun. She seemed like Pepper's opposite in every way. \"I'm fine, thank you. I wanted to introduce you to my new nanny, Ms. Pepper.\" Winnie introduced. Pepper examined the woman before her, and was disgusted by her cheeriness. \"Ms. Pepper, this is Madame Molly Monte Cristo.\" Winnie finished as she rocked on her heels waiting for her plan to fall into place. Molly extended a hand to shake and Pepper hesitantly extended her own. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Pepper. Are you new to town?\" The smaller woman pulled her hand away quickly and remarked, \"Unfortunately.\" Molly laughed at her joke, unaware that she was being completely serious. Pepper rubbed her hands together as if wiping off any germs the lady left on her. \"Well then you'll have plenty of new things to see while you are escorting Winnie around-\" \"Oh, i've seen enough.\" Pepper murmured under her breath. Molly continued as if she didn't even hear Pepper's comment, \"My personal favorite spot in town is the abandoned factory down on Curd's Way, but that's just me.\" Pepper's face contorted as she listened to this woman go on. \"Abandoned factory? That's not at all skeptical for a woman of your class.\" Suddenly she noticed that Winnie was missing. She mentally slapped herself for getting distracted on the job. She turned around quickly looking through the crowd to find her, but she wasn't in sight. Molly continued rambling, not even noticing Pepper wasn't paying attention. \"Yes, well I only really like it for the people living there. The former Red Hats, and the man of my dreams.\" The nanny turned back around to the annoying woman sharply. \"Madame, did you by any chance see where Ms. Portley-Rind went?\" she asked urgently. Just her luck, fresh on the job and she was already about to lose it. Ms. Monte Cristo snapped out of her own thoughts and back to Ms. Pepper. \"Oh, she was right here a minute ago.\" she put one hand on her hip and the other on her chin as she scanned around for the young girl. Pepper groaned; As much as she hated this demon child, her stuck-up father, and this whole stinky town she needed this job. The last thing she wanted was to go back home to her snooty older sister, her boring brother-in-law, and their bratty kids. \"So nice chatting with you m'am, but I must go find Winifred.\" sarcasm dripped on the word 'nice.' She began walking away from Molly but the tall woman stuck by her side. \"Let me help you!\" she insisted, beginning to look over heads of the people in the marketplace. She was taller than even most of the men in town and could easily see over all the heads of the people in the marketplace. Pepper stopped in her tracks immediately and shook her hands, \"Oh, no, no, no, no! This is my job and I can do this on my own.\" She knew she couldn't really do it alone, but the thought of spending another minute with that woman was unbearable. \"No, I insist! Besides you're new, and I know all of the places Winnie and her friends usually play, as well as every other nook and cranny they could possibly be. I grew up here, you know?\" Molly straightened her back proudly knowing she could be of help in this time of need. Pepper was having none of it though. \"Don't you have something better to do? I'm sure an upper class lady such as yourself wouldn't be up for running around town all day and possibly dirtying up your five hundred dollar shoes.\" she didn't even try to seem serious or nice in any way; It was nothing but stone cold sarcasm from the short lady. The blonde had a look of shock on her face. Here she thought she had just made a new friend and she was already treating her like the ditzy, rich, bimbo everyone else assumed she was. Her face scrunched up as she towered over Pepper and gave her a piece of her mind, \"See here, you don't know anything about me! You don't know anything about this town or Ms. Winifred for that matter! I could let you go off and search for her and watch as you have no luck whatsoever and i'll be sipping my merlot wine and laughing because you insisted in such a rude tone that you did not need my help!\" Pepper backed up step by step as the woman went on, \"But because i'm such a nice person I will help you, whether you like it or not! Now come along, I know just where to look!\" she quickly turned on her heels and made her way towards Milk Street. Pepper was a bit flabbergasted by the outburst, but followed close behind her, muttering under her breath. \"Oh, and by the way,\" Molly finished, \"they're not five hundred dollar shoes, their three hundred.\"[Chapter 2] The two ladies exited the busy marketplace and walked through the town. Pepper followed behind Molly, unsure of where they were going. As if she had read her mind, Molly began, \"We're going to go see Herbert Trubshaw. His boy Eggs is Winnie's best friend. If anyone will know where she is, he will!\" Pepper wondered how someone would name their child after a breakfast food, but ignored it as they approached a small hair salon. \"Hair Do Well?\" Pepper read the sign aloud, \"Is this Trubshaw man a barber or something?\" she asked. Molly shook her head, \"No, but he usually hangs around here with Hamilton. Chances are he's not here, but Hamilton can at least tell us where he lives so we could find him.\" They entered the shop; Inside there was a red barbers chair on a worn checkered floor in front of a mirror on the left wall. Under the mirror there was a table coming off the wall like a shelf, with scattered brushes, combs, hair products, scissors, and hair razors all over it. Across the room was another chair that was much more simple and a sink for washing hair. Shelves lined the back wall of the building, and a curtain hung in a doorway, assuming to lead to some kind of a back room. From behind the curtain, a man emerged dramatically with his arms in the air. \"Molly! You're not due here till the first Monday of next month, what can I do you for?\" He was just between Pepper and Molly's height and had light brown hair long enough to tie back into a ponytail. He had an even longer beard that was so big he had it wrapped around his neck like a scarf and a mustache under his long nose. He wore a blue and white striped shirt and red pants with gold and green stripes on either side. The man strutted towards the two and instantly started picking at Pepper's hair. \"Yeesh, more like what can I do you for, turtledove. Your hair is a wreck when's the last time you washed it?\" he criticized as he pulled a twig out of her bun and tossed it aside. Pepper whacked his hand away and took a step back. \"Mind your business!\" she said as she patted her bun, making sure he hadn't loosened it up. Molly stepped between the two, \"Hamilton, this is Ms. Pepper. She's Winnie Portley-Rind's new nanny.\" She placed a hand on Pepper's shoulder, but it was shaken off immediately. The tall woman was offended and pouted at the action. The man scoffed and put his hands on his hips, \"If she's her new nanny then where's the bloomin' kid?\" His sass was immense. Pepper stomped her foot and threw her hands onto her hips aggressively. She didn't even want to talk to this man if he was going to act this way. She grabbed Molly's arm and tugged her down low enough so she could whisper in her ear, \"Are you sure we need his help to find the Trubshaw man?\" Hamilton interrupted, \"Whatcha looking for him for? You should be looking for the kid!\" He held back a smirk, enjoying getting on the small lady's nerves. Pepper was ready to roast him when Molly cut in, \"If we find Herbert we can find Eggs, and if we find Eggs we can find Winifred.\" Pepper wanted to leave this shop and never step foot in it again. Hamilton was on her last nerves, and she had very few left. \"How do we know Herbert even knows where his carton of eggs is?\" she half joked about his son's odd name. Hamilton took a step towards the woman, \"Because unlike SOME people, Herbert knows where his kid is!\" He stood over her a moment taking in her shocked expression, then quickly turned on his heel away from her and back to the other side of Molly, purposefully whipping his long beard in her face. Pepper let out a small yelp as the hair whacked her on the cheek. \"That's it! I'm going outside!\" she shouted as she stomped out the front door to wait on the sidewalk. \"Hamilton!\" Molly scolded, giving him a whack on the arm, \"That's no way to treat someone you just met!\" He flinched as her hand made contact. He rubbed his arm and retorted, \"Some people are just so touchy…\" The lady rolled her eyes at his insensitivity. \"Wow, Blondielocks you really do pack a wallop.\" he commented. \"Could you please just tell us where Herbert is.\" Molly begged. She was used to Hamilton's rude banter, but she didn't like it when he threw it at unexpected participants. Especially since Pepper was her new friend, she didn't want to give her any bad impressions. Hamilton shrugged as he made his way towards the back of his shop, \"How should I know? I'm not his nanny.\" Molly rolled her eyes. \"If you really want to find him he lives on 793 Guernsey Lane.\" he finally spewed out something useful. The lady glowed and ran to her friend for a hug. \"Thank you, Hammy!\" He tried his best to untangled himself from her clutches, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever! Come on, I just ironed this shirt!\" he successfully pushed her off. They bid their goodbyes and she rejoined Pepper outside. Pepper waited out on the street for Molly to come back with the information they needed. As she leaned against the wall of 'Hair Do Well' she thought about what would happen if she didn't find Winnie. She had to have her back before dinner at five thirty this evening. If she returned to the mansion without the girl, or if Winnie returned without her, she would lose her job for sure. It was obvious to Pepper that Winnie had planned this all out in her head this morning. It was a clever plan, and she might actually succeed and get Pepper fired. With what time she had, Pepper was determined to find this demon child. The last thing she wanted was to return back to her hometown Knightingdale. She would have to confront her sister, and listen to all the nasty \"I told you so\" line over and over again. She shook the very thought out of her mind. No matter how stinky this town was and no matter how annoying the people were she wanted to prove that she could handle having a job and doing things on her own. \"Ms. Pepper!\" Molly tapped her new friend on the shoulder. Surprised, the nanny jumped and gave a shriek. \"Didn't mean to scare you!\" the blonde couldn't help but giggle. Embarrassed, Pepper patted down her hair and fixed her dress, \"S-Scared? No, not me. Not in the slightest.\" She found her way back to her calm and disinterested demeanor. \"So, did you find out where this Herbert man is?\" Molly nodded, \"He lives just a mile away down on Guernsey Lane. Come along!\" She began walking ahead of Pepper, leading the way. A mile down Curds Way and a right turn onto Guernsey Lane they approached the home of Herbert Trubshaw. Rather than a usual button doorbell there was a rope that hung down just beside the door. The rope lead up the wall and through a window on the second floor. The two girls looked at each other and shrugged. Molly gave the rope a tug and inside they could hear wheels and gears turning as if someone was winding up a giant music box. A moment passed and the noises halted. They gave each other another look of uncertainty, and then a simple 'ding-dong' rang just like any other house. \"Pfft, well that was dramatic.\" Pepper placed one hand on her hip, unamused by the fuss. \"DOOOOOOOOOORRS OPEN!\" they heard a shout from inside. Hesitantly, they turned the knob and stepped inside. The house looked like an organized mess of papers and notebooks piled on every surface. The brick mantle had books stacked haphazardly beside multiple framed family photos of a man, a woman, and a small baby. The only places clear of clutter were the couch and the chairs around it in the living room. \"DID ANYONE COME INSIDE? I'M IN THE BACK IF YOU DID! PLEASE DONT ROB MY HOUSE!\" they head another shout from around the corner. They made their way into the kitchen which was just as messy as the rest of the house, but less with papers and more with dishes, and found their way out a back door and into a lone alley. The narrow alley was congested with a large car parked just a few feet away from the door. Tools were spread all over the cobblestone making it seem even more crowded outside. The tall brick walls dividing the houses were covered in chalk writings of equations, drawings, and random little notes. Molly stepped down the two stairs into the alley and lifted her skirt as she carefully stepped over wrenches and screwdrivers. \"Mr. Trubshaw?\" she looked around for the man. She could have sworn she heard his voice coming from back here. \"Down here!\" he announced as he slid out from under the car on a wooden creeper. He had slicked back brown hair with a few grey stripes coming in and a matching beard and mustache that was neatly trimmed. His suit looked dirty and covered in oil, as did much of his face. Nonetheless he had a warm, welcoming smile on his face as he saw the ladies. \"Why, Ms. Monte Cristo! Haven't seen you in ages! How've you been?\" He grabbed a cloth nearby and wiped the oil and dirt off his face and coat. She put out a hand to help the man up and he took it graciously, \"I'm quite alright, thank you. How about yourself?\" she replied. He rised to his feet and patted the side of his car, \"Well i'm alright, but this ol' thing needs a good tune up. Been spillin oil like nobodies business! People started complaining so I gotta fix'er up.\" He then spotted Pepper still standing by the back door. \"Who's this?\" he asked, excited to meet a new neighbor. Molly gestured for Pepper to come down the steps and into the conversation. She paused a moment, and with a sigh she did so and stood next to her tall friend. Molly put her hand on Pepper's shoulder again. Rather than shake it off this time, she simply raised her shoulders in surprise, but let the hand stay, much to her discomfort. \"This is Ms. Pepper, Winnie's new nanny.\" Molly introduced. Herbert took the small lady's hand and gave it a good shake. \"Pleasure to meet you! Didn't think Winnie really needed a nanny though. She's about the same age as my boy.\" \"Yes, well-\" Pepper began to explain, but was interrupted by the man. \"You ever met my boy, Eggs? He's a hoot! Sure you'd love him, everyone does!\" he kept on rambling. Pepper tried many times to cut in but it seemed impossible. Molly watched her try and try again, with no luck, and finally made the initiative herself. \"HERBERT!\" she shouted loudly, finally getting him to shut it. She cleared her throat, \"Speaking of Eggs, do you know where he is?\" The man tapped his chin as he thought a moment, then shrugged, \"No idea. Probably with the Boxtrolls though. He'll be back here for dinner though, if you'd like to wait around for him.\" Pepper sighed, desperate for help, \"No, no! It'll be too late then! We need to find them now!\" Herbert felt terrible for having nothing helpful to give them. \"Wish I could help you ladies. If you need anything, i'll be here.\" He patted the side of his car again, and he began to crouch back down onto his creeper. The girls bid their thank you's and goodbye's then made their way back to Guernsey Lane. Pepper sat on the curb of the sidewalk in front of Trubshaw's house and thought aloud, \"Great, just great. I'm screwed! We're at a dead end: I can't find the kid, I have to have her home by dinner time and it's already two in the afternoon, and it's only the first day!\" She put her head in her hands as she sulked, trying to rethink her plans as she waited to get fired. Molly slowly slumped as she listened to her pal. She hated seeing people like this. After spending all this time with Ms. Pepper, she felt close to her; She considered her a good friend, and she had to cheer her up. \"Hey, don't give up yet. We've still got time.\" she paused, but there was no response. \"Ms. Pepper?\" she asked, bending down and placing a sympathetic hand on her shoulder. Pepper quickly and aggressively shook her hand off and stood up. \"Stop touching me! I can't stand it when you touch me!\" Caught off guard, Molly was shocked. She slowly stood back up to her full height. \"I'm just trying to help.\" she attempted, but Pepper was pissed. She was tipped off the edge with the shoulder touching, and now the canon was loose. \"I don't need your help! I don't need anyone's help! The whole point of this job was to prove i could do things on my own!\" she yelled. She turned away from the woman once again. Molly crossed her arms and sternly commented back, \"If you can do things on your own then why am I here?\" She turned on her heel fiercely and broke, \"Because I can't do this on my own!\" she was breathing heavily, and she felt light headed. She turned away from Molly one last time to hide the shame stricken on her face. Seeing Pepper's vulnerability made Molly's face fall completely. Seeing someone strong break was an incredibly sad sight to see. She went to place a hand on her shoulder but hesitated and instead kept it to herself. She paused before speaking, \"You know it's not too late. Winnie's out there still, somewhere.\" Another pause and suddenly a brilliant idea came to her. \"I know someone else who might be able to help us out! Come along!\" Molly began marching down the road leaving Pepper in the dust. Pepper looked at where she was headed and hesitated before following. \"Ugh, what else do I have to lose?\" She rolled her eyes and caught up with Molly.[Chapter 3] Molly knocked ten times on the door of the Red Hat factory. Pepper stood beside her unsure of where they were. Suddenly the door slid open to reveal a tall, gangly, bald man wearing a burgundy suit and a teal scarf. He had crooked teeth and a long nose. Pepper couldn't help but wrinkle her nose at the sight of him. He straightened up and brushed his hands off on his coat, as if it would help him look better in some way, \"Oh! Ms. Molly, so glad to see you. I knew it was you at the door!\" He gave her a big toothy grin, not even noticing Ms. Pepper beside her. Molly put her hands behind her back and smiled, \"Oh really?\" She began swaying back and forth in a flirtatious manner. Pepper watched in confusion. The tall man nodded, \"Yes, you always knock ten times.\" he paused, \"Also you're the only person who visits us.\" His face fell, but quickly perked back up, forgetting the thought. Molly giggled and continued making goo-goo eyes with him, until Pepper elbowed her in the ribs. \"Ah! Oh, yes, this is my friend Ms. Pepper. Pepper, this is my very dear, close friend, Mr. Pickles.\" Mr. Pickles nodded his head down at her, \"It's a pleasure to meet you!\" he extended a hand to shake. Pepper was about to take it when she noticed how filthy and bandaged his hands were and quickly backed away a step. \"Charmed.\" she said sarcastically. He slowly pulled his hand back to his side, confused with the whole situation. \"Alright then… Won't you ladies come in?\" he stepped aside, gesturing for them to enter. They did so, and Pepper was the least bit surprised that the building was basically a replica of what the man she just met looked like: Filthy, tall, and unpleasant to look at. It was messy like the Trubshaw's house, but in less of a homey way. It was more dirty and obviously only men lived there. To the left of the door was a wooden table where a large man was sitting on a stool playing an accordion. \"Hello!\" he greeted with a shy smile to the ladies. Molly waved to him, \"Good day, Mr. Trout. This is my new friend, Ms. Pepper.\" Pepper waved, praying this man was nothing like the tall one. \"What can we do you for, ladies?\" Pickles tried to act smooth by leaning one hand on the table. It wobbled for a moment until Mr. Trout rolled his eyes and rested his elbow on the table to balance the weight. Molly took a step towards Mr. Pickles, \"Well, Pepper here is Winifred Portley-Rind's nanny, you see, and we can't find her anywhere because she ran away because she hates Ms. Pepper.\" \"Gee Thanks…\" Pepper mumbled. \"Herbert told us that she and Eggs were probably with the Boxtrolls today, but he wasn't sure exactly where. I thought since you men were such great Boxtroll hunters back in the day you could help us find them, or at least find one and maybe they could tell us where Winnie is!\" Moly finished. Pickles and Trout were frozen, unsure how to process the information. Pickles cleared his throat and tugged at his scarf. \"You lost me at Winifred's nanny…\" Mr. Trout spoke up, Pickles nodding in agreement. \"We need you to help us find some boxtrolls.\" Pepper stated bluntly, crossing her arms. The two men gave each other nervous glances. Pickles fiddled with his fingers, \"Well, uh, you see we don't actually- Uh, we- we're kinda rusty in the Boxtroll catching department.\" Molly took another step closer towards him, \"Oh, I just figured that you knew all their hiding places and where they go around town.\" Pickles raised a finger a pointed out, \"Things have changed now though, they got different spots now, and-\" \"But you're a smart man, and we don't have many options left!\" she took his hand in both of hers and batted her big green eyes. \"Will you help us? Please, Monty?\" Flustered by all the touching, eyelash batting, and sweet talking, Mr. Pickles gave in, \"A-Alright then. Anything for you, Ms. Molly.\" A big goofy grin was stuck on his face as Molly jumped up and down and thanked him. \"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!\" She then wrapped her arms around him in a big bear hug. He was shocked, but not at all angry with the gesture. He took in every moment of it he could. Pepper shuddered in disgust at the gushy display. She looked over to Mr. Trout who seemed equally disgusted with it all. At least she wasn't the only one. \"Are they like this all the time?\" she asked him. He nodded, \"Unfortunately.\" Molly released her hug and was ready to hit the road. \"Come on then, we've not a moment to lose!\" Mr. Pickles was still in a daze. He stumbled on his feet for a moment, before turning to Mr. Trout, \"Are you coming with us?\" The man shook his head, \"I'm busy.\" He lifted his accordion as his example. Honestly he didn't want to go because he didn't want to deal with Molly and Pickles' nonsense. He was working on a new song however, and that was much more important. \"Alright then, shall we?\" Pickles extended his arm for Molly to take. She giggled and took it without hesitation. Pepper groaned as she followed behind them. Before leaving she looked back at Mr. Trout. \"Good luck.\" he waved. It was both in regards to her search for Winnie and having to deal with the two lovebirds. She frowned, realizing this was quite possibly the worst day of her life. Mr. Pickles marched them all around town to all the alleys and hiding places he and the Red Hats used to track Boxtrolls to. They used to have a map back the factory that had all the locations marked in red. They didn't have it anymore considering they didn't need it, but now it would have been helpful. Luckily he had it engraved in his brain pretty good; He remembered all the important places anyway. An hour later and it seemed like they were still making no progress. Not a single Boxtroll was anywhere to be seen in town, which was unusual considering they come out all the time nowadays. Mr. Pickles scratched his noggin and thought aloud, \"Don't make no sense. We haven't seen a single one anywhere. Where could they all be?\" Molly hung onto his arm, much to his surprise. \"I don't know, but we better hurry it up, we've only got an hour before Winnie needs to be home.\" She walked over to Ms. Pepper who was rubbing her templed away from the group. \"Do you have any ideas, Ms. Pepper?\" She shrugged, \"Don't look at me, I don't even know what a Boxtroll looks like.\" \"They're small and they wear little boxes.\" Pickles informed her. She rolled eyes and snapped, \"Ah, yes, so helpful. Thank you, Mr. Pickles. You have been nothing but helpful today!\" The man stood up straight and tall and smiled. \"Oh, you're welcome!\" he replied. Pepper groaned, \"I was being sarcastic!\" \"Oh… Alright then.\" he slumped his shoulders, rethinking what Pepper said. Molly sighed, hating seeing this all unfold, \"Stop this, come on! We just have to keep trying, they're around here somewhere.\" Pepper faced Molly holding up her hands in defense mode, \"No! You're wrong! There are no troll creatures and i'm not going to find Winnie in time!\" she sighed, and continued her eyes on the cobblestone. \"I'm tired of running around on this goose chase… I'm just going to go back to the house and tell Portley-Rind what happened. Maybe i'll get lucky. Probably not, but…\" she trailed. One last sigh of failure, and she dragged her feet along the sidewalk as she left the two alone in the alley and made her way back up to the top of Cheesebridge. As she walked along, she heard something shuffling in a trash can nearby. She stopped and watched it shake and rumble. Suddenly a creature popped out of the top victoriously holding up a rusty, bent trowel in it's grubby little hands. The creature was a pasty grey-blue color with pointed ears and wore a square box. She gasped as she watched the small troll jump out of the garbage and run along the street. She quickly picked up her skirt and chased after it, \"Wait! You there! Stop! I need to ask you something!\" The boxtroll didn't seem to notice her chasing it as it continued around corners and through different alleyways. It eventually tucked into a sewer entrance, leaving the round, barred door ajar. Pepper stopped, out of breath as she stared into the dark sewer She hesitated and then began to crawl inside. The deeper she crawled into the sewer the smellier and darker it got. She held her nose as she crawled with one hand. It was tough to do though, her dress kept getting caught on sticky things and loose bricks. She was stuck in one particular brick really good, and she had to use two hands to pull it out. She gave a tug, but nothing happened; One more tug, still stuck. One last big tug, and it came loose and sent her falling backwards. She expected to land on the bricks, but instead kept tumbling down, as if the tunnel had ended and she never even noticed. She rolled down the sewer and ended up slipping and sliding down what seemed to be dirt. She screamed as she slid out of control down into a deep hole and onto a makeshift conveyor belt. She finally landed face first in the dust. She sat up and coughed, spitting the dirt out of her mouth. Her head spun as she looked around her surroundings. It was like a book, like she just fell down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. Only this wonderland was a cave full of mechanics and a lettuce garden, with more of those Boxtroll creatures of all shapes and sizes staring at her from afar. As she recomposed herself, she noticed a small table where Winnie, a brunette boy, and two boxtrolls were sitting and sipping tea. Her eyes narrowed on Winnie, \"YOU!\" She stood up and brushed herself off. Winnie gasped, teacup still in hand, \"How did you find me?!\" Pepper waved her hand at the girl, \"That's not important, what's important is that I did it! I found you and now you are to come straight home with me!\" Winnie put down her cup and stood up in defense, \"But Ms. Pepper-\" \"When I tell your father about this-\" Pepper interrupted. \"You can't!\" The girl pleaded. \"I must! Tis' my job.\" She crossed her arms and stuck up her nose; Her mind was made up. Something pulled at her skirt, and she noticed the little creature she chased down there looking up at her with its big eyes. She stepped back in hesitation, the boxtroll shrinking into its box a bit. It poked its head back out and its ears perked up. He tried speaking to her in his boxtrollese. \"Wh-What are they doing?\" She looked to Winnie for help. \"They like you!\" the boy spoke up with a smile. He stood beside Winnie and laughed. The young girl's face grew a small smile as she watched the display. Pepper was unsure what to do, \"Shoo! Shoo!\" she said as she waved her arms at it. The boxtroll mocked her movements. \"Ahh, why is it doing that?\" The boy clarified, \"That's his name, Shoe!\" Pepper looked up and into the distance. \"How ironic.\" Shoe pulled out the trowel from his box and held it out for her. The lady hesitantly took the rusty thing, \"Oh, uh… Thank you.\" Shoe then proceeded to nuzzle against her and purr much like a cat. She slowly knelt down, put the trowel in her apron pocket, and put her hand on his head. She noticed more of the Boxtrolls gravitating towards her. Another one wearing a million spectacles took her free hand and put it on its bare head. She couldn't help but smile at the creatures, and mumble to herself, \"Lord Portley-Rind is worried about you hanging around with these kittens?\" The boy nudged Winnie forward. She sighed and approached Pepper. She sat beside her in the middle of the boxtroll group. A small one with a small funnel on its head sat in her lap. She hugged it softly and spoke to her nanny, \"All I ever wanted was for my father to stop neglecting me. Now all I want is for him to stop suffocating me. If you tell him what I did today, he'll never let me see Eggs or the Boxtrolls ever again.\" Pepper took a moment to think it over. There was no way Portley-Rind would ever reconsider things. He was a white hat politician after all. She finally figured it out, and began, \"You remind me of myself when I was your age; Bossy, irrational, and very clever. Only you had good friends that cared about you.\" she paused, then continued in a more stern tone, \"Alright, I won't tell your father what happened today, and it better not happen again. I'll let you hang out with your little friends and keep your secret safe. They're clearly no danger to you.\" she looked at all the boxtrolls around her, Shoe still cozy beside her. She smiled, \"As long as i'm your nanny you are in safe hands, Ms. Portley-Rind.\" Winnie sprouted up, \"Oh thank you, Ms. Pepper!\" She gave her a big hug. Pepper was shocked, but returned the affection. All the boxtrolls patted their boxes and slowly started joining. Even the boy piled onto the hug. \"Alright, you're all crushing me with your cardboard bodies, hop off!\" Pepper stood up and everyone fell off. She dusted herself off once again and fixed her hair. Winnie took her friends hand and pulled him towards her nanny. \"Ms. Pepper, this is my friend, Eggs.\" the boy waved to her with a warm smile on his face. \"Ah, you're the infamous Egg boy.\" Pepper felt relief finally having a face to match to the name. The boy wrinkled his brow in confusion. \"Nevermind,\" Pepper waved her hands, \"Come along Winifred, we got to get you home for dinner.\" The girl nodded, and waved goodbye to her friends. The boxtrolls all waved goodbye to Pepper, they were very happy to have met her.

Give them fuckers a bit of the ol One Two.\" The words were accompanied with a cheery grin and a quick jabbing motion reminiscent of the young man's origins in the boxing circuit. He'd never been major. Never had the focus or motivation really. His attention always on other less reputable pursuits but he was good. It was a light hearted comment made on a fairly standard job. Smash and grab with a few fellas he had just started dealing with. But two guards and a few quick fire punches later, every criminal in London knew all about the ol One Two, and a nickname was born. It just stuck. ... The man leaned over the table, eyes darting from side to side. Still new to the game. Still paranoid. \"Look, I know where we can...\" One Two blinked in confusion, leaning casually back in his own chair. Slightly younger but far more experienced. \"What?\" The other man sighed in frustration and leaned closer \"A few people have said you're the man to speak to about...\" \"Speak up will ya?\" \"Look I know about a fuckin robbery you might be interested in\" He finally blurted, teeth gritting in annoyance. A few eyes looked up from the surrounding tables before quickly looking away at One Two's warning glare. \"Well why didn't you say so Mumbles?\" It stuck. ... \"They call me the candy man\" \"Is that fuckin right?\" One two snorted, eyebrow raising even as he didn't bother looking up from the poker game. \"Yeah. Or Mister sugar. Sugar and spice, everything nice. I got all the goods me\" \"I'm sure you do\" The thief muttered, throwing some chips down. \"I got red ones, blue ones, smarties, poppers, or anything harder that tickles your fancy\" The dealer declared with a smug grin. \"I'm a regular Willie Wonka I am. The sugar puff monster. Mr Kipling himself\" One Two smirked as the rest of the table folded to his bluff and scooped in his winnings. \"That's fantastic Cookie. Good for you\" It stuck. ... \"Which one's Robert again?\" Mumbles asked. There were too many new people at this party and he was getting nervous. How was he supposed to trust a driver he didn't even know. \"Oh you know which one he is\" One Two grinned, several pints in and far too relaxed for someone planning a robbery. \" Can't miss Bob. Ol Bobby Boy. The Bobster. He that good looking bugger over there that keeps distracting all the lasses from me. Can't you see him?\" The grin got wider as Bob caught on to the sound of his name being shouted loudly and repeatedly in a heavily slurred Scottish accent and began making his way over, shy smile in place. \"Everyone knows Bob\" One Two declared throwing his arms around the young man's shoulder as he arrived \"Damn lady killer is what he is. Handsome Bob!\" It stuck. ... \"The name is Archibald\" \"Pleasure to meet you Archy\" \"Archibald\" \"Yeah. I heard you the first time Archy\" The sound of teeth gritting together and a cold stare did nothing to discourage the young man. Too cocky and confident to see the danger.

Bob closed his eyes, head still buried in his hands and breathed deeply to calm himself. What kind of question was that? After One Two's reaction to Bobs previous confession it was clear he didn't really want to know. Bob knew he shouldn't answer, should just tell his mate to forget it, drive them to the party and let this whole thing be forgotten in a haze of drink and drugs. Almost the send off One Two had planned. That's what he knew he should do. Certainly not answer a question as open ended and risky as 'What do you want to do to me?' God help him, what didn't he want to do? Then again, he had survived this far, and he was going to prison tomorrow, in for a penny, in for a pound as they say. Still he couldn't help the touch of sarcasm that edged his words, amazed and slightly annoyed that his friend was still poking at this subject. Hadn't this been hard enough already? \"What do I want to do? What do you bloody think? I wana do the horizontal bloody mambo with you One Two\" He glanced sideways at the Scotsman's face seeing the expected disgust in a grimace that his friend was at least kind enough to try to hide, forcing an uneasy smile to cover it. Surprisingly there was also an understanding there, a resignation showing that he had known that would be the answer and been prepared for it. Finally, there was a look of resolve. \"Would you settle for the regular mambo?\" Bob blinked in surprise, unsure what was being offered, if anything. \"What?\" \"You know\" The older man urged him, doing a little wiggle mime in his seat to emphasise the words \"Dancing\" Bob could have laughed if his throat wasn't clenching so hard \"Dancing? You wana take me dancing?\" There was a brief flash of hesitation on One Two's face and Bob almost regretted the question. Maybe 'want' was too strong a word. \"I promised you a good last night.\" One Two told him softly. Voice calm and sincere. \"I can't offer you everything you want Bob. I just can't. But if you want it I can offer you this\" The young Englishman felt tears welling up in his eyes and forced them down, determined not to fall any further in his friend's eyes than he already had. Bob wasn't any good at dancing, but One Two enjoyed it. Always looked like he was having fun with whatever girl had taken his fancy that night as Bob watched on from the side-lines, wondering what it might be like to be the one out there with the handsome Scott, bodies pressed close, moving to the music. Tonight, he had the chance to find out, if he wanted. It was more than he had expected. More than he had ever dared hope. One Two sat there quietly waiting for his answer, face still looking nervous but determined. \"Yeah ok\" Bob nodded, finally sitting up straight and taking another calming breath to steady himself, thankful that this time it worked \"Let's go dancing\" ","Summary":" \"What...what exactly is it that you...that you want to do to me then, Bob?\" The words were delive"},{"Movie":"RocknRolla","Title":"Lights Out","Author":"MyNameBeNobody","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9832015","Passage":"[Chapter 1] AN: First RocknRolla fic, and I've only seen the movie once, so sorry if I make errors. Also, I don't know too much about drug use etc. So I'm going to try and just be general, but if any of you have tips, please let me know! Not much dialogue or Johnny in this chapter, as it's more of a set up, there shall be more later, I promise! Hope you enjoy, please review! Haley Cranmer didn't want to admit it, but she was lost. That is, if she'd been thinking coherently, she would have thought that she was lost. As it was, in the muddled state of mind she was currently in, her sense of direction seemed perfect. Of course, she had no real idea where she was, not that it mattered. She knew where she had started off, and that was all that really mattered, not the ending. She had left home at 16:00 exactly, and had been walking around London for about five hours straight now. She didn't know what time she was going to head home, which wasn't hard considering that she herself didn't even know what the time was as she wondered the streets aimlessly. She'd left home with no goal, only 20£, her library card, and a packet of white power that she had found in her best friend's jewellery box. That is to say, her former best friend, and the reason for her long walk. Tory Billingsly's funeral had been exactly twenty four hours before Haley left home. Tory Billingsly had died a week before that. Haley Cranmer hadn't slept or eaten properly since then. She'd once heard it said that when you lose someone very close to you, a part of yourself is lost too. Well, close was too weak an adjective to describe Tory and Haley. Born within a day of each other, living a street away from each other, going to the same schools from age five to seventeen, sleeping over every weekend, never going a day without seeing each other. They had been friends for as far back as either of them could remember. They could not look more dissimilar; Tory's blonde hair to Haley's brown, green eyes to blue, tall to short, curvy to slim, right handed and left handed. Yet, every mannerism and expression somehow still a mirror. If there was ever a personification of other halves, it would have been Tory and Haley. Only now, it was just Haley. She had no other half, not anymore, and how long could only half of something support a shell of what used to be whole? She was already turning into a shadow, without the bright colour Tory used to bring into her life. Her already slim figure had already gone down to the point of skinny, and dark shadows fell under her eyes, beneath heavy streaks of dark eyeliner. Her dark hair was unkempt and unruly, falling about her face like a mourning veil. She had never noticed any of that in her grief, the empty emotion which weighed her down as surely as if she'd tied weights to her feet and plunged into the Thames. But now she had at last found an escape from that listless way of being. She was by no means happy, by no means back to the old days, but Tory's last gift had given her a window into her friend's old world, and now she revelled in it. There was only one point that Haley and Tory had ever disagreed over; drugs. Haley had never been curious enough to try, and in all honesty, it used to scare her. But Tory had no such inhibitions, and sampled freely as often as her allowance would allow. She had always urged Haley to loosen up and try something, but had never tried to force it onto her friend. Now that she was dead, Haley almost wished she had. Maybe then she would have given in, and maybe then she could have been at that party and stopped Tory from taking that one-hit-too-many. Because it was the drugs she'd lived by, the drugs that had brightened her life, which had eventually killed Tory far before anyone should die. Haley had never met any of Tory's other friends, or any of the dealers Tory had dealt with, she'd always avoided that part of her friend's life. But then, upon receiving a box filled with items of Tory's that were now Haley's to keep, she had found the little packet. She may not have taken drugs, but she had seen them enough to know when she'd found them. The white powder could have been either cocaine or heroin, Haley didn't have the knowledge to tell which, but she assumed the former, as it had been Tory's preference. She had almost thrown the little bag out, cursing it, hating it for destroying her friend's life. But she had hesitated, looked at it again, such a little thing. A thought had crossed her mind. What's the big deal? What was it that made Tory so dependant? Why did she love the feeling so? She had slept with the little bag under her pillow, but she hadn't touched it again, not until the night of the funeral. Then, she had sat cross-legged on her bed –just as she and Tory used to do when they would stay up talking until the morning- and held it in her hands. Such a little thing, such a huge fallout, such a little thing... She had spent the next day sitting, thinking, pacing, thinking, lying, thinking. Until her little clock had chimed 16:00. Then she had picked up her coat, put the little packet and her library card in its pockets, stuck 20£ into her bra; and walked out of the house. She had walked for three hours, stopping briefly to sit on several sets of swings, losing herself in the defiance of gravity, tilting her head back and letting leaves tangle into her hair. Then she'd found a cafe in some part of London that she'd never been before. It had been dirty, the faces had been unfriendly, and some of her 20£ got spent on a coffee that she didn't drink. Instead, she went into the bathroom. It was even worse than the cafe itself, and Haley had used the sleeve of her coat to wipe down the sink area before she spread out some of the cocaine. She had just been using her library card to cut it into lines, not sure what she was doing, following what she'd seen in TV shows, when two other girls walked in. Haley had frozen, unsure what to do, caught right in the action. But this London wasn't like hers, and there was no shocked horror in the eyes of the older woman. One flicked a scornful glance at the library card Haley was using, and scoffed quietly as she reapplied her lipstick. The other, sent Haley a slightly pitying glance as she leaned against the wall, but no one in the room spoke. Haley had waited until they were gone, before taking out the little tube she'd found with the packet, and snorting up the first line. It had been a shocking sensation, and she had almost sneezed it right back out again. The powder burned her nose, which was unfamiliar with this kind of treatment, and Haley had to shake her head to clear it before she could bend over and take in the second line. After wiping the tell-tale white smudges from the edges of her nose, she had exited the cafe without her coffee, and waited. The effects had been... quick. Tory had never mentioned that part to her, in the rare times they'd talked about drugs. The only thought that had come to Haley's mind had been 'so, this is what Tory felt, this is why.' Haley hadn't ever felt anything like it before. For the first time since Tory's death, she was able to forget the pain. A strange sense of happiness settled over her. She felt lighter than she ever had before, as if she was floating above the rest of the world. She vaguely remembered discarding her coat, making sure to remember to stuff the packet into her bra first, beside her change. It was a cold night, but she hadn't felt it then. She hadn't felt the cold, the pain, the loss. It had been wonderful. But that was nearly two hours ago now, and while sane thinking was still beyond her, the effects of the drugs had worn off considerably. She no longer felt like she was higher, she felt back to earth. The pain was at the edges of her conscience, flickering, waiting to slam back into her. Haley fought viciously to hold onto the effects of the drugs, to get back that feeling of joy, to forget. She understood now, she could see why Tory had taken the drugs, and she could almost see the temptation in taking too much. Death by happiness, there could be worse things. The feeling of being lost was finally settling into her, and an anxiety began to raise its head as she walked through unfamiliar streets. Suddenly cold and without a coat, she rubbed her arms clumsily in an attempt to warm herself. Everything around her looked derelict, nothing like what she was used to. Tiredness was beginning to make its way into her mind, and her body was slowly reminding her that it had been awake for a long time, and walking too much for the lack of food and sleep that she had been giving it. She began looking at the buildings around her with new eyes. She knew she couldn't make it home. It was late, she had no idea where she was, no phone, and she seemed to remember spending her money on something, but not what. Now that the high was gone, bad emotions began crashing into her, and she desperately looked for someplace that she could rest in for the night, and hide from the now scary dark of London. A group of men sitting outside a bar were looking at her in a way that made even her tired and still slightly addled mind worried. Even in beat-up old jeans and a rumpled shirt, some part of her brain tried to remind her that it was still dangerous to be out, and her pace picked up. \"Where are you off to, love?\" \"Bit cold out, come sit with us!\" \"What you doing all by yourself?\" Haley kept her head down, the packet burning a hole in her chest, as she picked the most abandoned looking structure and made for it. She wanted another hit, she needed it. Shooting a paranoid look over her shoulder, she decided she would ignore her tiredness and do it, as soon as she got inside. She shoved open hole filled door, the hinges were rusted, and there was so much junk behind it that she almost couldn't manage it in her weakened state. The place was dark, and with only the faint light from street lamps, Haley fumbled her way into an open space she guessed to be a main room. Gauzy material hung haphazardly, and she could see darker lumps that she assumed to be furniture. \"Hello?\" she called out. Pausing for a moment, she heard nothing in response, and felt sure that she was alone. A prickling feeling remained at the back of her neck, as if she was being watched, but she tried to shake off the paranoia. Gingerly feeling her way around, she eventually found a table, and felt a faint smile curve her lips, her first in a long time. Just as she was reaching in to get the packet, a light suddenly flicked on. It was weak, and would barely have illuminated the room to a normal eye. But Haley had been wondering in the dark for a while, and the drugs and tiredness made her extra jumpy, her still dilated pupils recoiling from what was to her a sudden onslaught, as she whirled around to face the room. \"What are you doing here?\" ","Summary":" AN: First RocknRolla fic, and I've only seen the movie once, so sorry if I make errors.

I've wanted to write something for them for a while and was always intrigued by what would've happened directly after the final showdown with Lenny. This story can be read as pre-slash or platonic friendship, I'll leave that up to you depending on what you prefer. Anyway, hopefully I've managed to do the boys justice with this story. Enjoy! By the time Archy arrives at the hospital another gathering has formed. His lips twitch in the faintest hint of a smile because Johnny always did love a gathering. In the sterile corridor stands Roman, Mickey, Mumbles, Bob, One Two, Cookie, Pete and now of course himself. It's the foundation of an empire if Johnny wants one. \"How is he?\" \"He's in recovery,\" Mickey supplies. \"They're not letting anybody in to see him yet,\" Roman adds. Archy isn't anybody, so he'll see about that. He lets himself into the room. In the bed lies Johnny, eyes closed, the bullet hole in his belly all sewn up. \"Alright there, John?\" Archy asks in a low voice. Johnny's eyes slowly crack open. Archy sees the deflation in them when Johnny recognises him. \"I don't think I'm quite fit for another round with you, Uncle.\" \"Forget that now John, I'm not here to argue. I just want to know how you are.\" \"Well I got shot by my dad, so I'm however that makes a person feel. Thanks very much for asking.\" \"You don't have to worry about Len anymore,\" Archy offers, taking a seat by Johnny's bedside. \"Old codger catch a cold did he?\" \"Yeah. Bottom of the Thames will do that to a man.\" His words almost bring a smile to Johnny's face. Almost. The damage Len did won't be fixed quite as quickly as the old bastard was. \"What did the doctors say?\" Archy enquires. \"A few stitches here and there, a couple of days in bed and I'll be right as rain. I'm in remarkably good health for a dead man they said.\" \"Secret's out now then?\" \"One of the nurses was a Quidlickers fan, can you believe that? Now I ask you Arch, what was a nice respectable girl like that fucking doing listening to music by a crack head like Johnny Quid?\" By the time's he's done, Johnny's words have degenerated into a dry cough. Ignoring the 'nil by mouth' sign above the bed Archy offers him some water, holding Johnny's head while he sips though a straw. \"There we go,\" Archy soothes, momentarily transported back to Johnny's childhood and the protectiveness he'd felt towards the boy back then. \"What are you doing?\" an unhappy nurse demands when she catches them. Quick as ever Johnny says, \"I needed something wet to wrap my lips around love.\" She doesn't see the funny side and orders Archy out of the room. He goes because she looks like she might have a slap to rival his and that she'd be more than willing to use it. As he leaves he wonders what they even put the water there for if Johnny wasn't allowed to fucking drink it. All eyes are on him as he's hustled out of the room. \"How is he?\" Cookie's the one to ask but the rest of them look just as anxious as Johnny's old pal does. \"He'll live,\" Archy tells them. His words are met by a collective sigh of relief. \"You lot might as well head off. Could be a while before anyone's allowed back in there,\" he says with a glance over his shoulder. \"What about you Arch?\" Bob says, ever the perceptive one. \"Think I might stay a bit,\" he says, dropping down into a chair to settle in for what he suspects will be some time if that nurse has anything to do with it. \"Are you sure Arch?\" Handsome says, something more than the expected concern at play here but Archy's too tired to try deciphering it. \"Yeah.\" \"Give John our best,\" says One Two, as they all head off leaving him alone. \"Hey Bob,\" he calls after them, Bob and his faithful pal One Two stop, the rest keep going. He'd heard there was a bit of a rift between the two of them but whatever that was it seems to be mended now. \"Do us a favour?\" \"Yeah Arch.\" \"Get that Pete into a clinic. I won't have any junkie's hanging around.\" \"Consider it done.\" Good to his word Bob, and One Two of course, head off in the direction of the hospital information desk rather than the exit. He takes this private moment to indulge in letting his guard down for a second. He's exhausted. The day certainly took an unexpected turn, a few of them actually, and the rug's been pulled out from under him. Of all the people in the world he never suspected Lenny to be a grass, but in hindsight he feels kind of stupid about that because Lenny always was good at feathering his own nest. He thinks about Johnny and everything he missed and can't help but wonder if Len did it on purpose. He'd been the one person Johnny could rely on and with one devious ploy Len had managed not only to tear them apart for four long years but to create a permeant rift in their relationship. Johnny had blamed him for the perceived abandonment, Archy hadn't taken kindly to Johnny's new attitude upon his release, and they'd never found their way back to the ease of old. The door to Johnny's room opens and the unhappy nurse steps out. Maybe she'll just walk right on by if he doesn't look up. But no, her feet come into view and he realises she's standing right in front of him. Toe tapping impatiently and everything. He looks up. \"Can you read?\" she asks. \"What?\" \"Are you illiterate or just plain ignorant? We don't put those signs up for fun.\" She means the nil by mouth thing. It was stupid of him but he'd always had trouble denying Johnny anything. \"I didn't mean any harm.\" Not fighting back takes the wind out of her sails and he does mean what he says. He would never do anything to knowingly hurt Johnny. He thinks she might see that on his face because her own expression softens dramatically. \"Try not to kill him this time if you sneak back in when no one's looking.\" She strides off, pointedly not looking, and he does indeed sneak back in. There's laughter in Johnny's eyes. \"I don't think she's very impressed with you.\" \"Shut up.\" He finds his way back to that seat, the one right beside Johnny. \"Never fear Arch, I managed to soothe her with my dazzling and irrepressible charm.\" Archy's not even gonna comment on that load of bollocks. \"The rest of the boys said to give you their best.\" \"Who else took up my bedside vigil then?\" \"Bob, One Two, Mumbles, Roman, Mickey, Cookie, Pete,\" he lists off, careful not to miss anyone because he's sure Johnny will be filing this information away for later. \"Couldn't tell me themselves? Had somewhere better to be, did they?\" \"I told them to go. I'm not even supposed to be in here.\" Johnny might actually miss a beat that time, well half of one anyway. \"Who are you now then?\" he jibes. \"Archibald the Magnificent? Set to ride in and take over Lenny Cole's vast empire.\" \"In a manner of speaking. Thought I might hold the reins for a while until someone more qualified comes along.\" \"Do these qualifications involve the fine art of sucking on a pipe?\" Archy meant to save this conversation for another day but since Johnny has brought it up... \"No they don't. They involve the clear thoughts of a cunning and gifted mind.\" \"I thought you said we weren't going to argue.\" \"We're not. As soon as you're out of here you're going into rehab. There is no other option, and therefore nothing to argue.\" \"You're not my father.\" \"No, luckily for you, I'm not. Unlike that old bastard, I actually give a shit about what happens to you.\" Johnny's face darkens with scepticism. \"Go on then, say it. Get it off that skinny chest of yours.\" Archy knows what Johnny's thinking. It's an old grievance, and it's a conversation that's been brewing for a long time. \"Always there when I needed you, were you? Pretty words, Uncle...\" He'd meant to be. It had killed him when he'd been locked up, knowing that seventeen year old Johnny was left alone to deal with Len and all the other strife he always managed to get himself into. Archy'd never been able to curb Johnny's reckless behaviour but he'd always been there in the aftermath to help Johnny however he could. Sometimes that had meant real work, other times just to lend an ear. \"I always tried my best to be. Come on John, what do you say? We've both made some right royal cock ups in our time. Can't we leave the past behind us and start fresh? Won't you let me help you?\" \"Think I might be beyond that now, Uncle.\" \"Don't be stupid John. You could be the very best if you set your mind to it. There ain't nothing you couldn't do if you wanted to. That's why you've gotta get cleaned up.\" The rare and honest praise works a treat. \"Well I might, if you promise me one thing.\" \"What's that?\" \"That you won't disappear on me again.\" \"I promise I ain't going nowhere. I'm gonna be there this time, every step of the way. I ain't never leaving you again.\" \"I'm gonna hold you to that.\" \"See that you always do.\" ","Summary":" AN: I adore both Johnny and Archy.

Not to mention, it's Tom Hardy . He's beautiful. Anyway, told from One Two's POV. Not mine. He glanced over at his friend, still a little sad but determined to make the most of the night before Handsome Bob was shipped upstate for his sentence. He tried to smile, tried to entice Bob into smiling with him. He elbowed the younger man softly, winking as he informed Bob that he'd managed to get the Harris twins. \"That cheered you up then?\" But a glance over at Bob told him that Bobby was no happier now than before. He furrowed his brow and kept driving. \"It's not that I'm ungrateful One Two…\" He looked over, pinned Bob with a gaze. \"It's just what?\" Bobby shook his head slightly, looking away, \"Don't worry…you wouldn't understand…\" Unease curled in his stomach, and he tapped the brakes, glancing over at Bob. \"I understand anything coming from you Bobby boy.\" He stared intently at the younger man, trying to pick up on what exactly was wrong with his friend. Generally Handsome Bob was the life of the party, making everyone laugh and smile. This Bob was just…wrong. But Bob looked up at him tentatively, a hopeful look lighting his dark eyes. \"Would you?\" He smiled, tried to be as honest as a crook like him could be. \"You're me best mate.\" Bob looked down, as if unsure, and the uncertainty of it was oddly endearing. He smiled at his friend, trying to encourage the younger man. \"I…don't want the strippers One Two…I want you.\" His foot mashed on the brakes as shock slugged him hard in the chest, chilling him all over. Of course, he was sort of flattered. After all, Handsome Bob was, well, quite handsome. A regular lady killer. And then the anger forced the flattery from his mind. He wasn't gay. He barely had the forethought to throw the car into park before he was out, leaving his door open behind him. In the next instance, as he paced back and forth in the street, the rage boiled over and out through his mouth. \"You dirty bastard! I know all your girlfriends, all of 'em!\" His rage was mixing with disbelief. He couldn't even manage to care as he watched Handsome Bob's face crumple in a horrified expression. Bobby dropped his head back against the car seat, \"See, I told you, you wouldn't understand.\" He jabbed his finger at Bob through the windshield, the words spitting from his numbed lips. \"Understand what?! That you're a homa? You're Handsome Bob for God's sake, Handsome Bob the lady killer ! I have had showers with you, you've seen my cock!\" His heart cringed as he noticed the glistening tracks on Bob's face. Handsome Bob's voice was so soft from inside the car that he barely heard the words said. \"I only told you cos I'm going away, but I should have kept my mouth shut.\" He kept pacing, nodding his head vigorously. \"Fuckin' right you should have kept your mouth shut, should have drowned the cat instead of letting it out the bag.\" Bob had curled in slightly on himself, his shoulders quivering with barely suppressed sobs. He pursed his lips, feeling horrid for having over reacted. He never wanted to see Handsome Bob cry. Slowly, he got back in the car, gripping tightly at the steering wheel and looking anywhere but at Bob. \"All right Bob, I am sorry. I went over the top, it was just a surprise that's all.\" He glanced over at Bob's face, stained with tears, and felt his heart curl. His immediate thought was to put his arm around Handsome Bob and hug him, try to console his friend. Instead he looked back out the windshield. \"Bit of a broad side Bob, do you hear me, I am sorry…\" He sucked in a deep breath, trying to prepare for the next words out of his mouth. \"Well what is it you want to do with me?\" He watched as Bobby wiped at his tears, looked out the window. \"Well?\" He heard Bob sniffle and shift back toward him. \"I just want a dance.\" Letting out a whoosh of air, he ran his hand through his hair, nodding slowly. \"All right. I…you can have your dance. But I'm not fuckin' gay. \" Later, on the dance floor, the promised dance was so far from what he had expected. He had expected throbbing music, Handsome Bob grinding against him to the beat, those hands all over his body as he just tried to make it through the night. Instead? There he was, in the middle of a darkened dance floor, while soft music played. Bob's arms were draped loosely over his neck, the younger man's head resting against his collarbone, and his own arms wrapped loosely around Bob's waist. They swayed with the music, their bodies moving easily together. He could smell the spicy musk of Bob's cologne. The smell, coupled with the obvious care in the way Bob held him, made something stretch in him. Of course he wasn't gay , but there was something about the moment, the tenderness of it all. He leant his head back to look down on the upturned face of his friend. Handsome Bob's eyes were closed, his dark lashes spread out on his cheeks. He could see the barest hints of stubble on his friend's strong jaw, high cheekbones. The dips in his soft looking mouth where his friend bit at his lips. He wondered if those lips were as soft as they looked. Shaking his head to be rid of the ridiculous notion, he looked away and leant forward again, resting his jaw against Bob's skull. He was acutely aware of Bob's strong, lean body against his. When he felt the fissure of desire uncoil in his gut, he chalked it up to Handsome Bob's proximity, mostly the easy pressure against his hips, the slow movement. He tried to push the feeling of lust away, but was unable. When he dropped Bob off after the dance and drove home to his dark apartment, he couldn't get the feeling out of his mind. He could still feel the lingering pressure of Handsome Bob's body pressed tightly against his. He could still smell the smokiness of Bob's cologne. Sighing, he rolled over and pressed his face into the pillow, tried to breathe in the scent of the last woman who had been there, but all his mind remembered was Bob's familiar, yet different, scent. His sleep was filled with dreams that he couldn't quite remember upon waking, and had a feeling that he wouldn't want to anyway. When he brought the shocking information to Mumbles' attention, the other man had just laughed. Informed him that everyone knew. Well, everyone but him. He tried to push it from his mind, to treat Handsome Bob as he always had. But every time he saw the younger man, the smell of Bob's cologne overwhelmed him and he thought about that night, and wondered at the possibility of more, and violently tried to distance himself from it as it made him think too much about himself. At the party, he watched as Handsome Bob smiled coyly at the dark-haired lawyer on the couch. Mumbles was telling him something, but his attention was solely on the sight before him. The man was swooning after Bob as if he was the best thing since the discovery of diamonds. And the lawyer wasn't…unattractive. Though, to be fair, he wasn't entirely sure of Bobby's type, so he was unsure how far the possible lust ran. Bob was grinning, laughing, and something curled hard in his chest. It took him a moment to recognize the feeling as jealousy. When Bob gave over the small slip of paper with, presumably, his number written on it, he was infuriated. \"I need some air,\" was all he managed to Mumbles before he was turning away. In a rage, he stormed outside and shook a cigarette free of the crumpled pack, lit it up, and inhaled shakily. He drew the smoke deep into his lungs, held it there for a brief second before letting it curl out through his nostrils. He heard the door hiss open, and he could smell the musky spice of Handsome Bob's cologne. He hadn't been able to get that smell out of his head since that night. He reached out and snatched Bob's arm, dragging him roughly over. \"The fuck are ya doin' Bob.\" Handsome Bob furrowed his brow, confusion clearly etched on his face. \"The fuck am I doin'? I'm fixing this mess! I'm getting your papers about some snitch.\" Bob yanked his arm free and went to walk away, but he grabbed the back of his friend's shirt, throwing the smaller man roughly into the brick side of the building. Pressed close against his friend, his forearm bared at Handsome Bob's neck, he stilled the other's movement. He leant in close, glowering at the younger man, who was unshaken. \"And you had to give him your fucking number?\" Bob's brows shot up, a disbelieving look on his face. \"And what are you? My fucking boyfriend? What's it matter if I gave him my number?\" \"Maybe I don't want to see that shit,\" he growled. Handsome Bob glared at him, those steely eyes narrowing. \"It's not as if I sucked him off in front of you. Jesus Christ! I gave the guy my fucking number.\" Jealously curled hard in his chest and he growled. The cocky smile that curled Bob's soft looking mouth served to drive the wedge of anger deeper. \"Maybe he'll call. And take me to dinner. And then we can go back to his house and fuck.\" That last statement was the straw that broke him. He saw red at the idea of that lawyer's hands all over Handsome Bob. He pressed his forearm harder into Bob's throat, leant closer. His words came out a low-seated growl. \"And what if I tell you no.\" Bob laughed at him, bared his teeth in a grin. \"And I say again, who the fuck are you? My fucking boyfriend?\" He smashed his mouth hard against Bob's, slamming the other's head against the rough brick. He kissed the younger roughly as his hands curled in Bob's expensive shirt. He pressed his hips tight against Handsome Bob's, as if trying to meld his body to Bob's and Bob's to the wall. When he drew back, he listened to the wet gasp of breath from Bob, felt the panted breath against his lips. \"No, but I don't share.\" He let Bob push him back, slip away from him. He could see the caution etched on Bobby's face as his friend moved away from him. \"What the fuck One Two. I tell you I'm gay and you flip the fuck out, then spend the last week avoiding me like I've got some fucking disease, and now? Now, you want to kiss me?\" Bob shook his head, a strained laugh slipping from his throat, before he turned around and left. And he watched Handsome Bob go, his gaze lingering perhaps overly long on Bob's tight ass in those dark, well-fitting jeans. Shaking his head, he strode back into the party, looking for Stella. When he found her, the normal appreciation was muffled a bit. The slinky dress just begged him to pull it off her. He grabbed her just above her elbow, pulling her close against him, and murmured in her ear \"Come with me.\" She gave a soft, throaty laugh as he tugged her along. He opened the back door of his SUV, tugged her inside with him. As he stretched out on the seat, his hands found the hem of her dress, pushing it up. She laughed at him again, \"Eager are we?\" He gave her a bright, crooked smile, \"If you don't want to play then get out.\" She gave him a simper of a smile as her fingers unlaced his jean button, pulled the zipper down. His fingers dug hard into her hips as he lifted her, positioned her over him. She gasped above him as he thrust inside, dragging her down hard. He moved quickly, taking no joy in the feel of fucking her. He let his eyes slip shut and had to clench his jaws, just in case he said the wrong name. But that didn't muffle the name from his mind, as Bob's name rebounded in his skull. Once she had slipped from him, left the SUV, he rolled onto his knees and fixed his jeans, ran his hand over his hair and face. He sat inside the SUV, reeking of sex, and wondering at what to do next. He briefly entertained the notion of going back inside and rejoining the party, but instead slipped into the driver's seat of the SUV and started it up, heading off in a random direction in search of a bar. The establishment he found himself in was a seedy place, filled with the clack of pool balls and static-filled music from an unseen radio. He downed beer after beer, stewing in the thoughts of Bob and that fucking lawyer. He tried to tell himself it didn't matter. After a while, when it was time to leave, he couldn't find his keys. His hands, crammed way down deep in his pockets, turned up nothing. So he pressed his heavy head against the dirty bar top, letting his eyes drift shut. A gaping blackness rushed up and covered him. The weeks following, he was hard pressed to treat Handsome Bob the same. He had begun to associate the soft musk of Bob's cologne with desire, and that was bad, he decided. All of a sudden, that night on the dance floor had created his own personal Hell. Anytime Bobby was around, he noticed things. Things like Handsome Bob's capable hands, his cheeky grin, the strong build of his body. He even noticed the little things, like the color of Handsome Bob's eyes, the gentle flex of muscles, the movement as he swallowed. And it was killing him. He wondered how Bob had managed to live like that, keeping his desires in check and under wraps, with the thing he wanted so close. The younger man had been dealing with it for however long, and like a fucking champ. And here he was, dealing with it for only about a month or so, and failing miserably. And then one day, it all broke. He was sitting in the bar with Mumbles, when a thick packet of documents landed on the table in front of him. \"Your snitch, my friends.\" He looked up at Bob, who was smiling brightly. He could hear the words of praise from Mumbles, but as he thumbed through the packet, he only wondered one thing. \"What'd you do for the info,\" he asked Handsome Bob. Bob gave him a cheeky smile, \"Ah ah ah, a gentleman never kisses and tells,\" and he swallowed hard. Bobby winked, gathering an uproar of laughter from the men around them. He was the only one not laughing. He was probably the only one who didn't find it very funny. The idea of Bob in bed with that sleazy lawyer made his stomach churn. He forced a smile to his lips and got to his feet. He leant against the bar, sipping his beer, and watching Bob mingle with the guys. Unintentionally, he let his gaze roam down Handsome Bob's frame, catching on those neat hips. He wondered if the lawyer had had his hands there, curled tightly around the wings of Bob's hips. He tried to shake the thought from his head, but instead his gaze landed on Bob's back, and the question of scratches up and down that taunt skin haunted him. When he finally managed to tear his gaze from Handsome Bob's frame, those steely blue eyes were boring into him. Bob lifted an eyebrow, an unspoken question floating across the room toward him. He jerked his head back toward the door, and Bobby nodded. Slowly, he wound his way through the smoky room and toward the door, certain that Bobby boy was following him. \"What's up One Two?\" He tugged the door open on his SUV and glanced across the hood at Handsome Bob. \"Get in the car, Bob.\" He watched the caution etch its way across Bobby's face, and he jerked his head toward the car. \"Just get in the fuckin' car.\" Slowly, Bob got in the car, and he started it up. The inside of the SUV was filled with silence, and he wasn't unaware of the vast amounts of tension. \"One Two…?\" He glanced over at the younger man, but didn't reply as they made their way across town. When he parked in front of his apartment, he turned to face Handsome Bob, \"Well Bob, let's go inside. We have some things to discuss.\" He watched as Bob's eyebrows twitched up, but the younger man followed him up to his room. When he shut the front door behind them, Handsome Bob looked at him as if expecting him to put a bullet through his brain at any second. \"So…One Two…\" He fixed himself a drink and pinned Handsome Bob with a look. \"What'd you do to get that information Bobby.\" Handsome Bob leant against the doorframe, giving him a disbelieving look, \"You're still on that?\" He continued to stare at the younger man, sipping slowly on his drink. Finally, a deep sigh slipped up from Bob's chest, a broad hand ran across his messy hair. Bob slumped down on his leather sofa, head down and staring at the floor. \"Christ One Two, you really wanna know?\" \"Yeah Bob, I do.\" He threw back the rest of his drink, feeling the liquor burn its way down his throat and into his stomach. \"Ah…I promised him a date. We met for coffee and a light breakfast. He brought the papers with him. He made me promise that we'd go on a fancy dinner date, with the possibility of something more afterward.\" He felt like his skin was crawling. Slowly, Bobby lifted his head and gave him a sullen look. \"Do you want to hear his exact words about me? Or is that enough?\" He nodded, \"Lemme hear all of it.\" Bob sighed again, slow and easy, and rubbed the back of his neck. \"He told me I was more than just a pretty face, that I was the complete package, and that you didn't know what you were missing.\" He watched as Handsome Bob got to his feet and began to pace. \"I…I just don't fucking get it One Two.\" Those steely blue eyes turned to stare at him, that icy gaze burrowing into his heart. \"I tell you I'm gay, and you flip. I ask for a dance, and you act like it's the worst thing in the world.\" Bob chuckled softly, looked away from him. \"I never thought it was so bad. All I wanted was to feel your arms around me, something good to hold on to while I was upstate. I mean, five years is a long time to go without anything good in your life.\" \"So I give you your dance and then you go sleazing around with that fucking lawyer? Makes perfect sense to me Bobby boy.\" Bob rounded on him, his head tilted down and a broad smile stretching his lips. \"Are you jealous One Two? Is that what this? Is that why you're chasing off any man who might want me?\" He flinched, felt his words jumble in his mouth. \"No Bob, that's not what this is.\" Bobby laughed sharply, and he could see the hurt in his eyes. \"So what is it? Now that you know I want you, you're just going to be the ultimate cock block to me?\" And then the words were coming up like vomit. \"That night on the dance floor has me all fucked up Bob. All fucked up. I have no fucking idea what's up and what's down. Sometimes I think it would be easier if you had asked me to just fuck you or something. Instead of a fucking slow dance . Now how am I supposed to feel.\" He looked up, watching as Handsome Bob cocked his head slightly to the side, staring at him. \"I have you all fucked up? What do you think all this has been doing to me? It's like you're fucking playing tug-of-war with my heart.\" He watched as Bob slumped down on his couch again, his head in his hands, and he slowly crossed the room. He sat down gingerly by the younger man, their shoulders nearly touching but not quite. \"How do we fix this Bobby? I can't keep going on like this.\" Bob looked over at him, and he could see indecisiveness lingering there. Acting on instinct, he leant in and crashed his lips against Bob's, pressing the younger man back into the sofa. He could feel Bob's hands curling against his back, pulling him closer until it felt like their bodies would mesh. Finally he drew back, feeling Bob's breath flaring against his lips. He stared into those dark blue eyes that were glittering cheekily. He could understand how Bob had people falling at his feet. \"You really think fucking me would help make up your mind.\" He could feel the nerves churning his stomach, and he shrugged. \"Only one way to find out.\" He offered Bob a wink and then got to his feet. And they went upstairs to his bedroom. As he tugged his shirt off, he watched Bob do the same, felt his mouth run dry at the defined muscles of the younger's core. Not that he was out of shape, but he was definitely starting to feel his age. He struggled out of his shoes and then his jeans, before striding toward the bed and sitting down on the edge in just his boxers. He felt nervousness well up in his chest as he watched Handsome Bob shove those dark jeans down narrow hips. Could he really do this was the only question slipping through his mind on infinite repeat, even as he watched Bob stroll toward him. And when Bob carefully straddled his lap, his mind went blank. Slowly, he ran his palms up Bobby's smooth chest, letting his fingertips trace the arched and curved lines of muscle definitions. The soft spicy musk of Bob's cologne wrapped around him. \"Alright,\" the younger asked softly, his broad palms resting on his shoulders. After a second's hesitation, he nodded, and felt Bob push him down roughly. His body contacted with the mattress but before it fully registered, Handsome Bob's form was stretched over his, his lips on his. Those capable hands were all over his skin, making his breath catch and hitch in his chest. His own fingers dug into the taunt skin of Bob's lower back, pulling the younger as close as he could. He kissed back. His lips nipped at Bobby's full bottom lip before his tongue pressed hard into Bob's mouth. He felt Bob's hands curl in his hair, tight against his scalp, and arched up into the touch. And for a bit, it was like he was breathing through that kiss, through Bobby. He broke the kiss long enough to force Bob onto his back, his body fitting tight against the younger's before he could really miss the heat of the other's skin. The thin fabric of their boxers really did nothing to hide anything, and he could feel Bob's hard on pressing against his. It sent shudders through his spine. He stared down at his friend, who was in much the same boat as him, he figured. But at the same time he couldn't remember ever seeing a more beautiful sight. Bob's lips were curved up at the corners, a bruised red, and barely parted. He could hear the soft rasps of his friend panting. That dark hair was mussed up, and he couldn't help but laugh softly. Those blue eyes opened slowly, darker than he had ever seen them. \"What?\" He chuckled again and smoothed down some of Bobby's errant strands of hair. \"I was just thinking, I can see where Handsome came from.\" Bob punched him roughly in the arm, and he was reminded of the younger's nature. Bobby may have been pretty, but he was still a member of the Wild Bunch and the best damned gunslinger in the city. \"And…that lawyer was right Bobby,\" he quieted long enough to brush a tender kiss against Bob's full mouth, \"You are the complete fucking package.\" He kissed Bobby hard, feeling their teeth clink together and tasting the plume of blood that busted from between their lips. He could feel Bob's fingers pressing tight against his lower back, pulling him closer. His hands landed on Bobby's hips, his fingers just barely curling into the waistband of the younger's boxers. Slowly, he pulled back and gave Handsome Bob an embarrassed grin. \"Ah…Bobby, I'm a bit lost.\" Bob smiled gently, pressed a soft kiss to his lips, and then slowly extracted himself from under him. His body suddenly felt degrees cooler without Bobby's heat as well. Bob kicked off his boxers, and he took that as his cue to struggle out of his as well. His breath left his chest in a soft wheeze when he looked up only to find Bob on his elbows and knees, his back sloped beautifully. \"Bobby?\" Those dark eyes peered at him over the broad muscles of Bobby's shoulder and back, and he could tell the younger was grinning. \"Yeah?\" His hands gently spread and curled around Bob's hips, and he pressed against his friend. Those dark eyes fluttered shut. \"Uh…how does this work.\" He could barely hear the breathless chuckle. \"Pretty much the same. Just…go a little slow, yeah?\" He nodded, smoothing his palms up and down the sloped back proffered before him. Finally, he managed to find his starting point and pushed. The point where his body merged with Bobby's felt like an inferno, and his fingers curled harder about those sharp hips. He could see Bobby's fingers curled about the sheets in a white-knuckled grip, his lips parted over his teeth like a grimace. He smoothed his hands up and down the younger's back, trying to keep the pressure as constant as he could. When his hips pressed against Bobby's tight ass, he pressed his lips to that slightly sweaty place between Bob's arched shoulder blades. He could feel the harsh panting of his friend, the hard inhale and exhale that made the frame stretched under him quiver. The heat was exquisite to the point of almost pain. Sucking in a deep breath, he began to pull back out. Almost gently, he pressed his hips back toward Bob. And then Bob moved, and it all broke. He pressed his face to the middle of Bobby's back, one hand still curled tightly about a sharp hip while the other spread on the bed to help him balance. His hips ebbed and fluxed against Bob's tight ass, harder and harder still until he finally managed to make Bobby cry out. The sound was raw, nearly wounded. A low pitched moan that he could almost feel being shaken free from the bottom of the younger's chest. It didn't take long for him to feel the sweet, burning hot pleasure curling tightly against the base of his spine. He rubbed his lips against the slightly sweaty skin of Bobby's back before biting down hard, crashing his hips hard against Bob's ass while he came. Over the rush of pleasure pulsing through him, deafening and blinding him to all else, he heard the same raw noise tear through Bobby's chest. In a tangle of sweaty limbs, they collapsed on the bed. He slowly opened his mouth, pressing an apologetic kiss to the dark bite mark in the center of Bob's back. He began to pull away, only to have Bob reach blindly for his hand. He let his fingers curl between Bobby's, relaxing back into his previous position of being plastered against Bob's back. He slipped off just barely, pressing his face into the cool sheets. Bobby turned his head just enough so that he could see those dark blue eyes over a shoulder. \"Alright,\" he asked softly, running his palm up and down Bobby's back. He could see the strain in the smile that barely touched those eyes. Slowly, he pulled back, careful not to hurt Bob. The sharp scent of blood reached his nose, making his nostrils flare gently. He reached for Bobby, but the younger rolled off the bed slowly. He could see the tacky streaks of blood on the inside of those strong thighs. Worry pitched hard in his stomach. Slowly, he rolled onto his back, bent an arm behind his head. He heard the shower start up as he stared at his ceiling. Whatever might have been salvaged from the friendship before this had been shattered. He worried that he would lose Bobby forever. But, he had been right. The sex had put everything into perspective for him. It'd been awhile since someone had kissed him the way that Bobby did. With hunger and passion that seemed bottomless. And that scared him, like it might yawn open and swallow him whole. Sighing, he closed his eyes and waited. When the shower finally shut off, he propped himself up on his elbows and watched the door with a quiet curiosity. The moment Bobby stepped out, he smiled. He couldn't help it. Bobby had always made him smile. The young man was too engaging by far, and that beautiful grin could charm a snake. He patted the bed beside him, and slowly Bobby crept across to him. Once the younger had settled in close to his side, he rolled on his side and slung his leg over that tight ass. \"I never woulda taken you for a bottom.\" Bobby laughed, a bright sound, and grinned charmingly. \"'m not. Just for you.\" The younger winked cheekily, and he felt the implications settle heavily in his chest. In that single regard, he had been Bobby's first. The thought made him sentimental. It made him want to tattoo his name on Bobby's tan skin, leaving hickeys and bites all over to show the younger had a place to go, where he belonged. He cast his arm over Bob's broad chest and pulled the younger closer. \"Did…did you get any clarity, One Two?\" He could hear the uncertainty in that soft voice. He disentangled himself from Bob and rolled onto his stomach, folding his arms under his head like a pillow. He turned his head to look into those dark blue eyes. \"Ya know, I was actually thinking about that while you were in the shower.\" He could see the carefully guarded look in the other's eyes, like a cushioning for a blow that was almost certain. He reached out a hand, curling his fingers through Bobby's. \"We're both ladies men, me more faithfully than you, a'course.\" Bob gave a snort of a laugh, his full mouth pursing gently. \"But I think…that I can be a Bobby man. I think I'd like that a hell of a lot more.\" He winked at Bobby, watching as his words sunk in. Bob tucked into his side, those soft lips finding his. He knew it would be hard, but these little tender moments would more than make up for it.

Archy is roped in to help. Author's Note: Inspired solely by BPAL's Jailbait perfume, because you know that's what Johnny would wear to get under anyone's skin. Bubblegum. Sticky, sweet, pink bubblegum. That was the first scent that hit Archy when he pushed open the door to Johnny's room. Bubblegum smeared over hard cherry candy, with a shade of something deep and smoky underneath. Something far too mature for a 16-year-old kid. Something familiar... Johnny's splayed out like a pin-up model, chest bare beneath a violet fur coat - the latest in glam rock fashion or the oldest in nonce, depending on who you asked - and torn, tight jeans slung low on his hips. A pair of over-sized sunglasses balanced precariously on his nose, bouncing each time he tapped his foot against the floor. The cloud of candy perfume didn't bother him in the slightest. In fact, he seemed to revel in it, as he slowly tongued a cherry-red lollipop between syrupy lips, looking for all the world like - \"Jailbait.\" \"What?\" Archy blinked, sure that mind-reading had yet to enter the boy's lexicon. \"That's what I'm gonna call my song.\" Johnny pulled the lolly out of his mouth with an O-shaped pop. \"Jail. Bait.\" Archy snorted. \"Get dressed,\" he ordered. John gave his shoulders a lazy roll, as if to say that dressed was a relative term, and continued musing aloud. \"But I can't decide which perfume goes better wi' the chorus.\" His eyebrows furrowed, as he swirled slow loops around the head of the lollipop. \"Get dressed in somethin' proper,\" Archy amended, turning to pick through the acid trip that passed for the boy's closet these days. \"You're father wants a word with you.\" He finally came up with a grime-encrusted T-shirt, the only contents that wouldn't throw Len into apoplectic fits ( if I see him dressed like a poof again, I'll fuckin' stab the little rat myself! ), and dumped it on the couch. The gesture went largely ignored. \"Should it be the pink bubblegum,\" Johnny tilted his head one way, \"or the cherry lolly?\" he asked, rolling it the other. At that moment, Archy realized where he recognized the scent from. \"An' if I ever catch you near my cologne again, those jeans ain't the only things that'll be shredded.\" He stabbed a finger at the kid's neck. There was a brief pause, as Johnny pulled the sunglasses down his nose to survey his Uncle's expression. \"I'll put yah down for the bubblegum, then,\" he announced finally, twirling the lollipop in Archy's face. \"Though yah really should give 'em both a try...\" A gleam crossed Johnny's eye, and suddenly, his voice dropped two octaves, the space between them to less than a foot, as he leaned in close enough for Archy to make out the fine, tawny fuzz that was just beginning to dot the kid's jaw. Peach fuzz, and poorly grown too. Eyes fixed on a stripe of sticky pink staining the boy's chin. Ridiculous on cheeks still round as baby apples. Seeing the look, Johnny grinned. Bit into the lollipop with a loud crunch . ...Somewhere inside Archy, a nerve frayed. \"Alright, that's enough screwin' about,\" he snapped. \"Now, getcha clothes on 'afore I do it myself.\" Grabbing Johnny by the shoulder, he dragged the boy up from the couch, only to be greeted by the cloying taste of cherries against his lips. Chunks of hard candy mixed with a slippery, wet tongue, caressing sugary sweetness into every crevice of his mouth, as saliva mingled like syrup. Coupled with the scent of his own cologne coiled at the boy's neck, a contradictory blend of sugar and dark musk, it positively dared him to push it away. \"So, whad'yah think, Uncle?\" Johnny murmured when he finally broke for air, eyes like poisonous caramel. As it turned out, he thought the cherry was better, although Archy wasn't sure if that conclusion came before or after he'd finished fucking Johnny into the couch.

Qu'est-ce que ça aurait changé ? Ce n'est pas comme si sa présence apportait quoi que ce soit... « Ça lui changera les idées ! » avait lâché Mumbles en souriant. Il y croyait lui. Bâtard. Qu'est-ce que ça aurait changé qu'il vienne ? Il n'était pas la putain de copine de Bob, il n'avait pas à aller chez lui jouer les infirmières. De toute façon, Handsome était pédé. Une putain de tapette. Alors, okay, lui et One-Two restaient amis, mais amis et rien de plus. Ça ne changerait absolument rien, qu'il vienne ? Absolument rien. Ça ne soignerait pas Handsome, et ce n'est pas non plus One-Two qui allait le faire. D'abord parce que Cookie s'en était déjà occupé, il ne restait plus qu'à attendre que ça cicatrise. Ensuite parce que One-Two n'était vraiment, mais alors vraiment pas doué en matière de soins. S'il avait essayé de l'aider, il lui aurait surement fait plus mal qu'autre chose. Non, il n'avait vraiment aucune raison de venir. Alors pourquoi était-il là, debout dans le salon d'Handsome Bob, à regarder celui-ci dormir ? Effondré dans un de ses divans, la bouche légèrement entrouverte, le châtain respirait lentement. One-Two était debout, au centre de la pièce, à attendre comme un con. Mais attendre quoi, bordel ?! Handsome dormait. Lui, il faisait l'effort de venir, mettant sa fierté de coté comme jamais, et lui, lui il dormait. Enfoiré. Les mâchoires te les poings serrés, bien enfoncés dans ses poches, One-Two fit demi-tour à grand pas rageurs, s'éloignant de l'homme endormi juste derrière lui. Il allait franchir la porte du salon quand soudain, son épaule heurta le coin d'un meuble, faisant tomber un...un truc qui devait être de l'art. Le brun jura, se baissant pour ramasser cette saloperie pleine demachins en métal. -...One-Two ? La voix ensommeillée dans son dos le fit se figer. Il se retourna lentement, très lentement avant de croiser le regard bleu délavé de son ami. Et il se trouva comme un con. - Heu...Je...J'ai fait tomber...Heu, ce truc. -Ouais, ça j'ai entendu , mais, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ? One-Two ouvrit la bouche pour répondre, puis hésita. Il aurait pu mentir, dire qu'il était venu rechercher un DVD qu'il lui avait prêté il y a longtemps, ou trouver n'import quelle autre excuse merdique. C'était pas comme si ça allait changer quelque chose. Mais à la place, il ferma la bouche, et fit un pas. Mit les mains en poches. -J'suis venu voir comment t'allais. Et attendit. Enfaite, il n'eut pas à attendre longtemps. L'expression incertaine d'Handsome se changea bien vite en un sourire, un putain de sourire éclatant, et One-Two pouvait voir dans ses yeux que ça lui faisait vraiment plaisir. Et il se dit que, finalement, c'était peut-être pour ça qu'il était venu. Ça vous a plu? Review? :3 ","Summary":" Salut!

Author: ThePointGirl Fandom: RocknRolla Pairings: Johnny/Archy Warnings: None really – but you do know its SLASH, right? Rating: T – R (for later chapters) Read: in class :-P Disclaimer: Guy Ritchie owns RocknRolla – all of it, even bloody Mumbles ha-ha. So yeah, don't own it – wish I did own Johnny and Archy though ;-) Notes: Well I thought for ages about writing a RocknRolla fiction, so here it is. #1 \"Daddy was a bank robber, but he never hurt nobody, he just loved to live that way and loved to take your money!\" Johnny sang to his room. Swivelling the silver barrelled pistol on his index finger, he admired the cut of the angel wings on each side of the trigger. It was Archy's gun. Archy being his Daddy's right hand man – the one who's loyal 'til the end. He found it, well nicked, it off Archy's desk. He was bored, wanted something to play with. He knew how to handle guns 'cause he was brought up tagging on to East London's very own Mafia. Catching the gun he held it, pointing it at random objects in his room. These objects included the leaning tower of Pisa that was his song lyrics. Piled high with unfinished lyrics, bursts of poetry and some heartfelt bollocks that Pete said was 'nice'. Moving his arm in a swift motion he pointed the gun at the mirror at the end of the room. Tall, slim and glaring glass - reminded him of his 'Uncle' Archy, smirking at his own joke he pulled the cigarette from his lips. He puffed out a load of black curls and ripples. Holding the cigarette and the gun out in front of him for inspection he thought about putting the two together. That would result in a complex problem, i.e. Johnny would owe his 'Daddy' a huge sum that he wouldn't be able to pay off till the ripe age of 200. He stopped. Hearing movement on the floor below and a door slam, he was sure someone was back. Johnny threw the gun (which was on safety) onto the leaning tower of Pisa across the room. The pile descended in a wave of paper – the gun hidden beneath it. The room smelt of smoke – not that, that mattered: all of Archy's gang knew Johnny smoked various substances. He was Lenny Cole's stepson, he was a little prince. Jumping up from his bed he bounded out the door and walked straight into Archy. \"Hey Uncle Arch – didn't hear you come up. You're like a ghost\" Johnny grinned bouncing on his feet like a terrier who wanted to be played with. \"It's called subtlety Johnny, something you can't seem to do\" Archy said carefully, holding his words like gold. \"I can – \"Johnny replied and Archy looked straight at him. Johnny had to lower his eyes. Not because he was ashamed, but Archy had a look that seemed to cut through his many layers. Even his old man couldn't do that – it was all Archy. Puffing at the cigarette he had briefly forgotten about he directed the smoke away from Archy (knowing how much he hates it). The reason why Johnny Quid was stuck in the Cole establishment for night and day like a prisoner: was because he had decided to take a tour around London a couple of nights ago, free of charge. The joyride had ended in a squeal of wheels and a crash of glass on metal. The situation managed to escalate as the person Johnny slammed into was not a normal – Archy'll-give-him-a-slap-and-he'll-sod-off – driver, he was a driver-delivering-some-real-expensive-antiques-for-Lenny-Cole-for-a-client. That was the sole reason why Mr Quid was confined to his bedroom singing rock ballads and not singing hymns at the bottom of the Thames. Archy moved passed Johnny into his room uninvited, looking around. His expression wasn't of disgust but it wasn't outright glee either. Johnny stepped back into the room, watching Archy's every movement. \"If you're going to ask me to clean my room Uncle Arch, I'll say no\" Johnny said cheekily, his voice a little coarser from the substance. Archy turned around, his black (probably expensive) coat swung about him. \"Johnny boy, asking you to do anything and you listening would be a miracle\" Archy said, still scanning the room – eyes resting on Johnny for seconds at a time. Johnny smiled, his school boy smile. \"I listen to you\" \"Yeah, after a few backhanders\" and a not-so-innocent smile replaced the other one. \"Whatever you're thinking of saying – don't – I'm not in the mood\" these were one of the times where Johnny was positive Archy was a mind reader. The eyes of a pure RocknRolla burned into his own – depth of brown. Johnny still wasn't sure why Archy was up here, in his room: shouldn't he be running jobs for his boss? \"Not that I don't want you here – but why you up here Uncle Arch?\" Johnny asked stepping closer to Archy. The man was now looking at some of the lyrics that were scattered about, sitting on his heels his head bent to the floor. Bollocks. Under those lyrics was Archy's gun. Johnny walked over to the window and chucked the dying cigarette into the evening air. \"Your father asked me to check up on you\" was the reply. Johnny coughed, he half believed that, but that most likely wasn't his Daddy's exact words. More like: 'Go see what that dirty little shite is doing on his own' or a variation on that theme. \"Well, your spelling hasn't improved\" and Archy stood up putting his hands in his pockets. \"Johnny\" That voice Johnny knew from experience. He was in trouble. That smooth baritone was not a good thing when it pronounced his name like that. Johnny froze. \"Pick it up\" Archy was always the one of few words. \"Pick what up Arch?\" he adopted his softer, childlike tone. \"You know what. Down there underneath the paper\" Archy said calmly. Johnny began to walk closer to Archy. He wasn't scared of him, just alert of the man's presence. Stooping he shifted aside some paper – one looked like a caution notice – and laid his hand on cold silver. Always having a fast reaction time he spun about pointing the gun at Archy. Unfortunately the Archy was that bit quicker and snatched at Johnny's t-shirt and wrist. Johnny didn't put up a fight, he was nowhere near as strong as Archy. A flick of the wrist and a jab, the gun was now in Archy's hand. The click of the safety and a smirk on the older man's lips that made him high. Johnny looked at the gun and then at Archy. \"Don't hurt me Arch, I'm only little\" he whimpered in jest. He was still really close to Archy's lean body, their legs almost entwined. Johnny bit his lip and looked up at Archy eyes wide and sultry… Okay, don't shoot me please? It was just an idea... but review if you like it and want me to continue. xxx Johnny/Archy :D ","Summary":" Title: Archy's Gun has Angel Wings.

There was no answer. She walked further into the room, trying to figure out where her lover was. He didn't sleep in the bedroom; the man didn't like enclosed spaces. \"Johnny?\" she called a little louder. There was a bang from behind the bedroom door, and she jumped not expecting it. The blue eyed woman crept closer quietly. She pushed the door open and sighed. Johnny was curled up in the corner, quivering, black, yellow and purple bruises contrasting starkly with the pale skin on his face and arms. She shuffled closer slowly, cooing softly, so as not to startle the man. Johnny looked up at her and the helpless lost look in his eyes almost made her cry. If a few tears did leak out, neither of them said anything. She knelt down beside the man, reaching out to try and comfort him. He flinched back and she stopped moving. She drew her hands back to her body and closed her eyes, prepared to wait as long as it took. After what was like hours, the woman felt shaking hands draw her into a warm, clammy chest. She just relaxed and let herself be moved. Johnny cuddled her in his lap like a child's comfort object, something they were never willing to let go of. \"What happened, Johnny? What's wrong?\" she asked almost inaudibly. He hid his face in the crevice between her jaw and neck. She never knew why she asked such stupid questions; there was only one man in the world that could turn Johnny Quid into the fearful child he had been, a long, long time ago. And yet she knew that Johnny was never far away. ","Summary":" \"Johnny?\" the brunette asked, searching the apartment with her eyes. There was no answer.

No. That's not true. Anger was his reaction to his first response. His first response was betrayal, hurt, a bit of fear, and a lot of shock. Betrayal because Bob's his best mate after Mumbles, only now it turns out Bob's been lying to them all for years. Hurt because he's trusted Bob to take a piece of shrapnel out of his shoulder and Bob can't even trust him to tell him, oh by the way, I like cock. He firmly ignores that he's clearly demonstrated that maybe Bob was right not to trust him with this. Fear because if he's missed this – about a guy who's kipped on his couch, puked in his bathroom, committed crimes with him (repeatedly) and regularly wrote him when he was in lock up – what else has he missed? He knows he's not exactly school-smart, but he's always liked to think he's got street smarts. Shouldn't he have known? If he can't tell when his mates are lying, what good is he? Shock because it's like a bucket of water has been poured on a dusty window and suddenly he gets it. He yells some about Bob's girlfriends but it all makes sense, doesn't it? The too-long hugs, the barely-there interest in girls, some of his jokes (which now don't look like they were jokes at all). And it's worrying on a more personal level because One Two had always thought that some of the things they did were perfectly normal for blokes, like being naked around each other or talking about sex or that one time when Jenny Howell and her friend Rosa agreed to have sex with One Two but only if Bob came along as well (only Bob said no, and now One Two has to wonder why on earth that was his answer). Now he has to re-evaluate his whole life because maybe he's inadvertently said or done something to make Bob think that he was like him, and for all that he' a bit weirded out by the gay thing, he doesn't want to be That Guy, the one who leads people on and then spits the dummy when they take him up on it. And now he feels terrible, because Bob's saved his hide dozens of times, and Bob's never judged him, not even that one time when One Two almost went home with Annie (short for Arnold, but she was pretty bloody believable, okay? It's not gay if she looks like a girl!), only here he is, making the kid feel lousy on his last night free. This night was supposed to be about Bob being happy, only now they've both ruined everything. One Two doesn't even know what to do when girls cry, let alone when it's Bob – Bob who still drove them the fuck out of there with a broken arm and a concussion that one time and then refused to take the painkillers the doctor had prescribed for the arm. He's feeling panicky and guilty, and that's the only excuse he can give for why he offers what he does. There's a point, later, when he almost wishes Bob had asked for something sexual because it would have been less weird and awkward than the dancing. end Notes: BTW my headcanon is that One Two is just majorly in denial and Bob/One Two is my OTP but I'm not a fan of the Suddenly Realised I'm Gay And We Should Have Lots Of Quickly Escalating Sex With No Angst Whatsoever scenes, so, none of that here.

About time really since I've lived in this lovely country for exactly six years this summer and will soon move away again X(. Anyhow, so he told me that since I liked Inception and Tom Hardy's performance in it, I should watch this film. Apparently he's 'well funny' in it. Tentative question: was I the only one who thought it was a bit heartbreaking when Bob 'fessed up to One Two? I thought the whole thing was quite sad actually. The rest of the film is funny I have to say, but that struck me a bit ….sad… I wanted to hug him. Anyways check this out: Family Ties \"This crap is gonna be the death of you, you know that, right Bobby?\" The man in the hospital bed shifted under the covers and blinked up at his visitor, pupils almost lost in the gray of his irises due to the morphine streaming in his blood. \"Sophie? The fuck you doin' here?\" He slurred, wincing when he tried to sit up, forgetting about the stitched up hole in his gut and falling back against the mattress when it made itself known. He remembered then and frowned at the young woman standing next to the bed. \"You meant to be at uni.\" It was meant to sound chiding, but he did not quite manage and anyways, she was still glaring at him, like it was him who was missing lectures and getting marked down for it. The visitors own gray eyes saddened and she sank down on the edge of the mattress and gripped his cold hand, staring at the IV line under the skin. \"You're my big brother.\" She eventually said as if that explained it all, but his foggy brain was not that quick to follow, so his forehead crinkled in confusion. \"You almost died.\" Sophie continued, still not looking at him and he might not be the sharpest tool in the shed right then, but he could tell that she was fighting with tears. Any other time, he would have hugged her tightly for comfort, like he had done ever since they had been little kids, but he was pretty sure that was not a good idea right then, what with the throbbing in his middle and squeezed her hand instead. \"You're such a twat, you know!\" She suddenly snapped, tearful eyes looking up with sudden anger and he felt himself shrink under her glare. \"Taking a goddamn bullet for that worthless piece of crap!\" Her shoulders were quivering with rage. Bob just about managed to open his mouth, but before he could say anything in his defense, she continued, tears now streaming freely. \"He doesn't even love you back! Never has; too much of a cunt to let you go too though! Why don't you just leave? He just keeps you around for the dirty work, you stupid fucker!\" Her accent which had faded ever since she got that scholarship at the posh uni was back on fully throttle and the sick man flinched at her words despite himself. He closed his eyes for a moment at the sight of her breaking down like that. She started to sob outright and he knew he had to do something. He looked at her slumped form sitting on his bed, crying her heart out and lifted his hand to her head, guiding her to lie against his shoulder and carefully wrapping his arm around her back loosely. It was a poor substitute to the way he had held her when she was little but it would have to do. Sophie kept most of her weight off him, so it would not hurt him, but did not protest and continued crying into his shoulder. \"It's alright, Sophs. I'm ok. I'm still here.\" He muttered into her short chestnut hair, suddenly feeling a lot more alert than a few minutes ago. Waking up to find his baby-sister having a mental breakdown because he nearly did not survive the fact that he had pushed his boss and best mate out of the line of fire was decidedly sobering. \"Yea, but how long?\" She hiccupped and gingerly pushed herself back up, to look down at him. \"You're going to get yourself killed, Bobby. What am I going to do without my big brother?\" He tried to give her a smile to reassure her. \"I'm not going anywhere, little sis. Someone's gotta pay the bills.\" She was not buying it, knew him too well. \"You have to stop. Just got to.\" She told him undeterred and with a note of finality. \"You what?\" \"You heard me. You have to just walk away from this whole shit. \" She crossed her arms over her chest. \"My degree is paid for and as soon as I get a job, I'll make enough money to take care of you too.\" \"And I'll be what? The idiot big brother who lives with you?\" There was a lot more force in it than he had planned, but it was a soar spot and she was digging in all the wrong wounds. \"Don't be a tit.\" She snapped right back, \"you could as well just admit you're staying for that big tosser out there.\" He could not stop his eyes from flicking to the door and she caught it but instead of enraging her more, she deflated. \"You sure know how to pick 'em, don't you Bobby?\" She asked, hand rubbing through the short rasps of his hair with affection. \"I can't help it.\" He protested weakly, adrenaline slowly wearing off and leaving him feeling drowsy. He really could not. He had tried. For years he had tried and ever since the secret was out it had become even more difficult. \"I know you can't big bro'. I know you can't\" Sophie muttered wistfully, taking his hand again and squeezing a little. She sighed heavily. \"Just promise me you'll be careful and try to stay alive. I need you.\" Bob's lids by then had started to grow heavy again and he was fighting it, to shoot her a smirk. \"I will.\" He rasped tiredly and squeezed her hand. \"Need to be there to scare off my sis' boyfriends, don't I?\" \"Don't you dare.\" She gave a tiny laugh, but there was still too much worry there. \"I mean it, okay? No more jumping in front of bullets.\" He hummed in reply, eyes already drooped shut, but still held her hand tightly and pulled it to his mouth, planting a kiss on it, because he knew she hated that. Yet, instead of the expected noise of annoyance, he heard her sigh again and just before he drifted off again, he felt her place a kiss on his forehead. Maybe he had been far more gone than he had thought. She must have been really scared, he mused. It would be his last conscious thought as the drugs pulled him under. When she stepped out into the bleak corridor, Sophie had to take a deep breath and leant back against the door for balance. He was all right. Her brother was fine for now and sleeping peacefully in that drug induced haze. She had not managed to convince him to lead a safer existence, but that was to be expected. He had been part of the Wild Bunch for too long to just up and leave, especially because of certain members. She let her head fall back against the door. If her brother were to get himself killed there would be hell to pay, she would make sure of that. \"How is he?\" A low Scottish voice spoke from somewhere to her right and her eyes snapped open. \"How is he?\" She snarled without opening her eyes, every word dripping sarcasm and anger. \"That all you got to say?\" \"Sophie…\" -\"Shut it! I'm talking!\" She told the big man across from her and this time her fiery glare did meet his. \"My brother saved your ugly butt from a bullet, flat-lined on the table for almost a whole bloody minute and all because he's in fucking love with you!\" \"I… I'm not a fag.\" One Two managed dumbly when she had to take a breath, but it must have been the wrong thing to say, because suddenly she was right in his face and despite the fact that she only reached mid-chest, he could not help but back up against the wall. \"I don't give a flying fuck! That's not what this is about! It's about the fact that you keep him around like a bloody loyal dog on a leash!\" The small woman had dropped her voice to a menacing hiss, noticing the nurses staring at them. \"W-what d'you mean? I don't do shit!\" He was quickly growing more and more agitated and Sophie felt a deep satisfaction because right now, this man was a threat to her family and she refused to tolerate it, just like Bob had refused to tolerate those of her boyfriends who had wanted to break her heart. \"Are you that stupid or are you just playing? You say jump, Bobby is just going to ask how high! He'd do anything for you as long as you keep him around.\" She turned away from him then, pacing back to the door of the room \"Why couldn't you just tell him to fuck off? Sure, he would hurt for a bit, but then he could move on.\" Her right hand slid up to touch the door deep in thought. \"He always does it. He falls for some cock-less prick and only leaves if he gets chucked out or something. Loyal like a dog one of them said once.\" She turned back around to see One Two staring at her, not comprehending. \"You know, he's my big brother, so he always watched out for me when I needed it, but who's going to watch out for him?\" \"I…\" The Scot started, but she interrupted him. \"I'll be damned if he gets himself killed for an idiot like you!\" She told him, and once again walked right up to him, making him feel almost as uncomfortable as when he had let her brother talk him into a slow dance because he had wanted to make the stupid sod happy before he was being put away. \"I'll say this once, but I'll say it clearly!\" Sophie sneered at him. \"If Bobby dies and it is in any way whatsoever related to you and your stupid half-arsed plans, I will find you and cut your dick into tiny little slices like a salami, that clear?\" One Two swallowed hard. \"I didn't want this to happen.\" He told her sincerely. \"I didn't know! I swear I didn't know he'd do some stupid crap like that. I thought he was over the whole thing.\" For some reason, this admission managed to drain all anger out of her and she just stood there, giving him a sad look. \"Well, now you do,\" She murmured as if that was all she had wanted, \"and you had better at least watch out for him from now on.\" Her raised eyebrow was enough to remind him of her threat and he gulped but nodded. \"You know you've got one spitfire of a sister.\" One Two remarked when he, still feeling a bit guilty, gave Bob a ride back to his flat after he got discharged from the hospital. Mumbles had come along as well and was snoring away in the backseat. Still looking pale and blurry-eyed, his mate grinned broadly nonetheless. \"Yea, she is.\" \"And she swears like a fucking sailor.\" The Scot continued, eyes back on the road. Bob turned his head, giving him a close inspection, and then the grin broadened even further. \"She scared you, didn't she?\" \"What? No, hell no.\" One Two shifted uncomfortably, not helping his case. The other man just snorted and went back to looking out the passenger window. \"She's the smart one. Always deserved better than the shithole we grew up in.\" He spoke again after a pause. His friend nodded because he did not know what else to say. \"What's she studying then?\" Bob moved restlessly, one palm rubbing at the still healing stitches. \"Medicine.\" The Scot gave a whistle. \"She'll be a doctor?\" It was an unnecessary question and the younger man rolled his eyes but nodded. \"Well, make sure she won't have to patch you up too often.\" One Two spoke in the sort of voice that was overly loud to not sound like he cared and more like an order. Mumbles grunted awake behind him from the sudden noise and glared at him through the mirror. Something bright flickered through Bob's eyes, then he looked away again, hand still resting over his injury. \"Nah, I'll be careful. Want to see her get married to some nice bloke and be happy.\" His tone was pensive and he did not say anything else, refusing to look at One Two afterwards. I know it doesn't exactly fit the tone of the film but you know... Would love some feedback! ","Summary":" Okay, a really good mate of mine, bless him, is trying to educate me in English films.

Mother instincts kicked in, and she ran into the other room where her two eldest were starting to wake up due to the noise that had erupted outside their bedroom window. \"Mother\" asked the daughter, \"what is going on?\" The mother ran to the window and looked outside to see Snatcher and the Red Hats approaching the front door. A loud banging echoed through the house and the son got out of bed and went into the hall and to the front door, the girls following behind him. He opened the door to see the large man blocking the outside. \"Is your mother in Andrew?\" asked Snatcher. Andrew nodded and moved his ten year old body out of the way. His mother approached the door - her twelve year old daughter hiding behind her nightie. \"Yes?\" \"I'm afraid to tell you that your son and your husband has been taking by Box Trolls\" said Snatcher. The mother covered her mouth in shock. Her daughter sobbed and Andrew gripped the door harder. The Lord of Cheesebridge then approached the door, his own baby daughter asleep in his hands. \"I'm afraid that without a husband, your family will have to give up this house for another\" he said. The women suddenly grew angry. \"And what? You'll just throw a grieving widow and her two children onto the streets!\" \"No, I am going to hire you as my nanny\" he said, \"you have the night to pack.\" Once everyone had returned to their homes, to hold their own babies and children close to them, Mary Louise Trubshaw closed the door and feel to the floor, tears streaming down her face in waterfalls. \"Mama\" Anyalise Trubshaw sat on the ground beside her mother and held her, Andrew on the other side as they grieved for Herbert and Edward Trubshaw.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer : I Do Not Own Boxtrolls. Precious Family Chapter One Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, the curfew is in force. Don't dawdle or the beasts will tear you limb from limb! They will add your flesh to their rivers of blood and mountains of bones. Lock your windows! Bolt your doors! Hide anything that is not bolted down. Hide your cheese. Hide your tender and delicious babies! Beware the bloodthirsty monsters! They'll fry your eyes, gnaw on your knees, gobble your gizzards... Beware! BEWARE! Anya rolled her eyes as she closed the curtains in the bedroom of young Winifred and made her way back to the bed where the young girl was sitting up. \"That man gets more and more irritating as the day goes by\" she said as she smoothed the covers down. \"Yeah, I know. How's your mother doing?\" asked Winifred. \"She's still ill. But she's getting there. Until then, I'm your nanny, got it\" said Anya , poking her young charges nose. \"Got it. We're still going to the Trubshaw baby festival tomorrow, right? You and Andrew promised me.\" Anya took a deep breath. \"Yeah, of course\" she smiled as she blew out the candles and left. \"See you in the morning\" she smiled. \"G'night.\" A few hours into the night, a noise outside woke Winifred up. She groaned, rubbed her eyes and made her way to the window, pulling the curtain aside a little to see out. She saw the edges of the shadows and a trash lid roll before stopping. She hurriedly shut the curtains, a light in her eye. \"Boxtrolls\" she whispered,\"they could eat my face off any moment. I need to warn father.\" She left and made her way to her father's meeting room. After knocking and receiving no answer, she pushed the door open. A wide hall filled with four men as they taste cheese enter Winnie's view. Winnie's has known these men her whole life, mostly because they never seem to leave her house. Boulanger mostly sleeps in his wheelchair, thin and beaked Broderick laughs at everything her father says while across from him sits his exact opposite, Langsdale, stuffing himself silly and her father stands proud as he should, being the Lord of the town. Lord Portly Rind. \"Settle down, men, settle down\" her father says, \"important town business to discuss. First up is the multiple complaints of crumbling bridges.\" \"Speaking of crumbling\" interrupted Langsdale, \"is that a new blue cheese I see.\" Broderick stands and sniffs the cheese. \"Does smell delicious\" he comments. Portley-Rind sighs and says: \"I suppose we could do with a nibble first,\" as though they were actually going to do any work for the town. The four men sniff the cheese, rolls it around in the mouth and spitting into bucket, as though the cheese were a wine. They comment on it to until Winnie stands and says in a clear voice : \"Father.\" He chokes on a chedder. \"Winifred\" he choked, and he stood and marched his way over to his daughter. \"Winifred go on. Off to bed. Off to bed! Come on, come on.\" \"But father! I saw boxtrolls again!\" she cried. \"Shoo, shoo shoo\" said Portley-Rind, escorting Winnie from the room, although the majority of his attention was still on the goings on in there rather than his own daughter. \"They're right outside\" Winnie excalimed,\"they could come rip the flesh off my bones any moment!\" \"Would be a shame to miss this,Portley-Rind!\" was catcalled from the room. \"Yes, yes, one moment!\" he called back before turning to look at Winnie, \"Winifred, proper girls should not be obsessing over monsters.\" Portley-Rind's attention is directed to the shenanigans going on in the room. \"I'm not obsessed! I just can't stop imagining them gnawing off my toes and stringing them together as a necklace! Father? Father\" Winnie said. Her father, clearly not paying her attention, agrees and pats on the head. \"If they kidnapped me and slurped up my intestines like noodles, would you give up your white hat to save me?\" Winnie asked, a frown on her face. \"Hmm? Um. Yes, Winifred.\" \"Father\" Winnie yelled, clearly angry. \"What? Uh... White Hat? Right.\" He takes his hat to look at it and see a smudge of dirt on it, so he passes it to his daughter, \"Be a dear and have the butler give it a wash, would you?\" He hands a stunned Winnie his White Hat and turns her toward the stairs. He closes the door before she can open her mouth. Winnie, glowering, goes back to her room, opens her balcony doors. \"I'll give your hat a wash alright\" she grunt before she throws it into the street.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer : I Do Not Own the Boxtrolls. Boxtrolls Precious Family Chapter Three Winnie rubbed her hands, clearly pleased with a job well done when she froze. \"Uh oh\" she whispered once she realised that she had thrown her father's most prized possession where a boxtroll could come along and steal it! The young girl hurried down the large steps and into the foyer. She slowly unlocked the door and opened it. Winnie took a single deep breath before emerging into the street. She slowly approached the hat, muttering \"I can do this\" under her breath with every step. The hat almost seemed illuminated as she got closer. Then she heard a rustle and a bin lid hitting the group. She grabbed at her chest, attempting to slow her racing heart and quiet her breathes. \"Whose there?\" she called, her voice hiding her fear. When a figure made its way to Winnie through the fog, she would deny till her dying breath her three quick steps backward. She scrunches up her eyes to get a better look at the hunch over figure with glowing round eyes. Winne held her breath with the thought that the boxtrolls can create their own monsters. Then Winnie released a loud gasp as the figure stood up straighter to get a better look at her. The figure came closer and remove its goggles, revealing a young boy staring at her. She took a another step back before bring her courage forward. \"Who are you boy?\" Winnie demanded. The boy frowned in confusion. \"Boy?\" he questioned before being grabbed by two boxtrolls into the darkness. Winnie, naturally, screamed before seeing the boxtroll catchers giving chase. Then she quickly grabs her father hat to make her way back to her house. Archibald Snatcher grabs her before she can take another step. \"Hmm\" he hummed, \"someone's out past curfew. Very, very dangerous.\" Winnie stared at him, white faced, before she muttered : \"I saw a boy.\" Snatcher, however, was too busy taking the white hat from her lifeless grasp to listen properly. \"All I saw was filthy boxtrolls\" he said. The Snatcher turned a yellow, fake smile on the young girl. \"Miss Portly-Rind\" he gushed, \"allow me to escort you home.\" He offered her his arm. She pushes it away and wipes her hands on her night clothes. \"I can escort myself, thank you very much\" and turns her back to him. Snatcher grunts, grabs her by the arm and starts dragging her home. \"Honestly, I can take the hat and return myself. I'm sure that the boxtrolls are all gone for tonight\" she said. \"I'm just wanting to know how the hat got out here in the first place, is all?\" replied Snatcher, before rapping his oily knuckles on the white door.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I Do Not Own Boxtrolls. Precious Family The door opened to Winnie's maid's daughter. \"Mr Snatcher\" said Anya. Mr Snatcher went red and started stuttering. She allowed the man into the house, giving a look as she passed that made Winnie want the ground to swallow her whole. \"Is your master in?\" asked Mr Snatcher. Anya had to smother her need to say that she had no master. \"I'll fetch him, Winnifred would you mind returning to your rooms please\" said Anya. Winnie nodded and went to move, but Snatcher grabbed her arm. \"I would like to speak to Lord Portley-Rind with his daughter present. Now go fetch him\" said Snatcher. Anya took a deep breath before going to get her mother's boss. They came back a few minutes later, and Lord Portley-Rind was not a happy man. \"Mr Snatcher, what is the meaning of this?\" he snapped at the man holding his precious white hat. \"My lord\" said Snatcher, bowing deeply, \"my deepest apologies for the intrusion. But I happened to fine something in the street that I believe belongs to you.\" He held out the white hat and the Lord grabbed him out of his dirty hands. He passed it to Anya. Snatcher eyed both hungrily. \"Eyes of the hat, Mr Snatcher, for they had to be found but earned\" said the Lord, stepping in front of the young woman. \"Yes\" purred Snatcher. Winnie found that he had let her go, and moved to stand behind her father, \"through a duty.\" \"I am aware. Soon enough, all the boxtrolls will be exterminated and I will earn my very own white hat\" said Snatcher. \"Sadly, there will still be a pest among\" muttered Lord Portley-Rind. Snatcher smiled a dirty smile and made his way down. \"Wait, what I would like to know if how my hat got outside in the first place?\" asked the Lord. Snatcher sneered at Winnie, \"Ask your daughter, my Lord.\" And Snatcher left. \"I saw a boy\" said Winnie, before anyone could get a word in. \"Not a word\" said Lord Portley-Rind. \"But...\" Anya covered her mouth. \"Get her to bed, and make sure she stays there\" said the Lord, \"and get my hat washed.\" And he left. Anya removed her hand. \"I did see a boy. He looked like he was wearing a cardboard box\" said Winnie as she followed Anya back to her room. \"That doesn't sound plausible. You might have imagined it.\" \"But I did see a boy. And no one believes me, but he is in danger. I saw him getting grabbed by a boxtroll. It has to be investigated\" said Winnie as Anya forced her back into bed. \"Yes, and Mr Snatcher and his men will handle that. You need to sleep\" said Anya as she left the room, turning the lock while she did so. Winnie glowered at the door. \"I did see a boy, and I'll prove it somehow\" she said.

She growled and howled within her head as an arm shot loose from the confines of her blanketed prison. When she reached the small silver device that seemed Hell bent on destroying any remnants of a wonderful sleep, she slipped it open and readied herself for a yell. \"Yeah?\" she snapped angrily. The young woman struggled to sit up, her body sore and aching from not getting enough sleep. She'd only just made it passed the precipice and slipped into the dream world when she was so cruelly ripped from its embrace. She wasn't happy. Silence stretched for a long period, long enough to cause her aggravation to grow. She knew she hadn't dreamt the sound of her phone ringing; it was too cruel a sound. So she waited and still there was nothing. Fearing she may indeed be losing her mind, the young woman pulled the phone back and saw an all too familiar number and name staring back at her. Every semblance of anger suddenly vanished from her with the passing of a single breath as she pushed the phone to her ear again. This time she could hear the haggard breathing of the man on the other end of the line. Her brows pulled together tightly. \"Johnny?\" she asked meekly, fearing that saying his name would cause him to hang up. There was a hitch in the breath, nothing more. \"Johnny,\" she whispered, slipping out of bed and to the bathroom. \"Johnny please say somethin'. I can hear ya breathing.\" Her ears were met with the sound of fabric or something else rubbing against the phone and nothing more. Her brows pulled together tighter than before, her eyes burning with the promise of tears not far behind. Her gut turned with anxiety thick in her throat and threatening to choke her. Her heart beat so hard, it began to hurt and still he wouldn't speak. \"Please, say something.\" She begged with cracking voice, wanting to know he was alright despite the enveloping fear he wasn't. The shuffle happened again and this time she heard a muffled sound. It took a trained ear to notice and even more so to identify, but she knew it was the sound of crying. She heard a sniff, the exhale of breath and knew there were tears in the man's eyes. Her arms ached to hug him and make him feel better, to take away the pain she knew he was trying to drown out but intensifying in the process. She wanted to make everything better. Before she could open her mouth again, the screen on her phone lit up. The young woman pulled her phone away and read call ended. The phone call lasted all of one minute and three seconds of nothing but breathing and silence at four eighteen in the morning. The urge to call him back was immediate and overwhelming, but she knew he'd turned off his phone. It was tradition at this point, so he wouldn't have to hear her beg or cry because she was scared. He'd turn it off or take the battery out completely and forbid her from calling him back. Every time, she would think that maybe this was the time he forgot, that this time he would expect her to give up and not return the phone call and every time she would do it regardless just to check. Every time it was off. Sleep wouldn't come now, now that the fear of something wrong encompassed everything around her. She was sitting against the bathtub, welcoming the cold, remorseless tile of the bathroom. Her knees curled to her chest and she hugged them desperately, still holding her phone tightly in the off chance he would call her back. With her face buried in her knees, the tears finally came and she cried for him. She lost count years ago, how many times she's cried or how many tears flew her lashes on his accord, but it was unavoidable. The door opened but she didn't hear it. She didn't feel the arms that hugged her or the man telling her to come back to bed as he wrenched her phone from her hand. This wasn't the first time she'd gotten late night phone calls from him and it was unlikely to be the last. ~~!~~ The young man sat in his bathroom with his bare torso pressed against the clear glass of the shower stall. The cold feeling was welcomed. His arms were propped on his knees and his head back against the glass forcing him to stare at the ceiling. The tears were hot against his skin as they fell silently from the corner of his eyes, over the contour of his sunken cheekbones and around his ears before somehow making it to his neck. He didn't feel any of them. His eyes burned from a mix of the tears he was shedding and the smoke hanging low in the cool room, the smoke he was desperately wishing would either return to his lungs or choke him entirely. He shouldn't have called her. He knew that, he just couldn't stop it. Like the hundreds of times before, he gave into the urge to feel normal, to feel human again and called her. His rational mind screamed for him to stop but was silenced quickly with another hit from the cylindrical piece of glass. The idea became better and better the more he inhaled the noxious fumes of his pipe. He grabbed the phone that held only her number, the cheap burner he kept and could lose without problem because it held none of his other numbers and he could turn it off without reservation. Guilt yes, tremendous waves of it, but no reservation. She was the only one in it, a number he had memorized long ago. She didn't change it and part of him knew that was his fault. She never would, just so he could contact her. The second he hit the call button and heard the rings, the drug began to wane. Its hold on him weakened and faded completely when he heard her voice. The moment his name left her lips, the guilt began to swell again. He felt his mouth open repeatedly, trying to speak and form something resembling words, but no matter how hard he tried, they wouldn't come. His throat closed up and the pain began when she spoke again. The rational mind wanted him to hang up, what little of it was left, but the addict couldn't. He wasn't only addicted to the drugs coursing through him, no, that would be easy. He was addicted to torturing himself in every way. He had to feel the pain of disappointing her, of making her cry at his expense and the fear in her voice. He had to feel the grating agony she induced in him because it meant some piece of him was still alive. That piece, no matter how small, tortured and anemic, was the only thing that kept him breathing. It was the only thing that made him keep going when everything else made him want to slit his wrists or overdose. That one little, inconsequential piece was all that remained of his soul and she somehow managed to breathe life back into it when he swore it was going to die. That was when the tears began, when he heard her voice crack as she asked for him. He dropped his head down between his propped up knees, the hand with his phone rubbing the back of his head as he fought to rid himself of the image of her face looking painfully at him. His shoulders trembled lightly as he tried to shove the feelings back down, the ones he tried so hard to drown with the pipe. With a deep breath, he sat up again, his head against the cold glass and the phone to his ear. With glassy eyes and hazy vision, he stared at the countertop overhead, hearing her ask, beg, for him to speak again. He sniffed and steadied his breathing again. Her eyes burned in his memory, that sad and pained look from the first time she saw him like he was now and it was too much. He'd reached his level of torture and had to end it. Pulling the phone from his ear, the young man ended the call and turned the phone off with practiced motion. He thought maybe one of these times he wouldn't, that he'd welcome her calling him back, but it wasn't likely. He couldn't listen to her asking if he was alright, if he needed her or if he was coming home. It was too much to take. Pushing himself up from his seat, he went to the mirror above the sink and panted his palms on the cold marble of the hotel's vanity. His head fell between his shoulders before he dared to look up. His mouth hung slack from the lack of energy to close it, his lips chapped and damaged. His eyes looked black where they weren't bloodshot and dark circles encompassed the entire socket. His cheeks were sunken in and hollow, adding further to his spectral appearance, and his skin an ashy, sickly white. He wasn't a man any longer; barely anything more than a shell of what he used to be, which wasn't much to begin with in his mind. Gathering what little saliva his cottonmouth would allow, Johnny spat at his reflection, at what he'd become and what he knew he'd die as. \"Fuckin' junkie.\" He growled to himself before pushing off the countertop and moving into his hotel room for another hit of his pipe. Okay. I really love this movie and think Johnny Quid steals it from the get go not to mention Toby Kebbell is an amazing actor. I hope you guys like this because I really do. Let me know what you think.[Chapter 2] AN: Hey guys. It's been a few years, but I've decided to go ahead and upload the rest of the story. I wrote it awhile ago, but if you guys are interested, I'd be happy to upload the whole story. Let me know what you think, and enjoy! Chapter 2 The sun had risen long ago. Sleep didn't come for her that night. Once she'd answered the phone, she knew it wouldn't. Her cell phone was still clutched firmly within her narrow fingers. She clung to it as though it were her life-line. For hours she prayed he'd call back, but he didn't. He never did. At some point, she'd propped her elbow on the wooden table and rested her chin in her open palm. Every once and awhile, she would catch herself slipping into slumber, but the sobering thought that Johnny may call always ripped it away. \"Why do you keep doin' this to yourself, Andy?\" The voice was unexpected and caused her insides to jump. Andy turned to see her fiancé standing in the kitchen only a few feet away with a stern look on his face. He was disappointed in her. She didn't care. Andy rolled her head back towards the window and mumbled into her hand, \"I'm not doing anythin' to myself.\" He didn't believe her. The exhaustion from the previous night clung heavily to each word. As she continued to stare through the open windows into her garden, a cup of steaming tea was set down in front of her. Andy mumbled her thanks, but didn't bother looking up. She could almost feel her fiancé staring at the back of her head. \"What, Adam?\" she asked, again without bothering to turn. He hesitated to speak. In truth, it wasn't that he was at a loss for words that held his tongue. He was quiet because Adam knew he'd yell if he didn't take a moment or two first. \"I'm gettin' tired of this.\" He finally said. While his volume was normal, it was clearly tense. \"How many fuckin' times is he gonna put you through this shit?\" Andy finally turned to face him. She gave Adam a warning stare. \"Careful,\" she said. \"No,\" he snapped. \"I'm sick of this.\" \"He's my oldest friend, Adam.\" She sighed. Andy dipped her head again. She was too tired to fight right then. \"Some friend.\" Adam spat back angrily. \"Every time he calls you in the middle of the night, you're a wreck for days.\" Andy scratched the back of her head lazily. \"I'm not having this argument with you again.\" She replied softly. Andy's eyes went again to the window. Adam had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from yelling again. Every time. Every fucking time, this happened. Johnny –her supposed friend- would call her in the middle of the night. He'd never speak before hanging up. Andy would cry, she'd tremble and shake and worry for days. Every time Johnny called, he'd send her into a depression. The first few times he called in the beginning of Adam and Andy' relationship, it frightened him. Adam didn't know what to do or how to make her feel any better about a situation he knew nothing about. Eventually, Andy told him about Johnny and why the calls scared her like they did. His fear soon turned to pity and for awhile he tolerated the sporadic calls. They'd only come every few months, so it didn't bother him. At first. After the same thing for their three year relationship, Adam began to lose his patience with everything. It was clear Johnny didn't want to get clean, so he couldn't understand why Andy would put herself through such pain every time. After a few moments of silence, Adam approached her. He bent forward, kissed the top of her head curtly, and left for work. Andy didn't move. Instead, she remained where she was, lost in her thoughts. In truth, Andy couldn't keep from answering the phone whenever Johnny called. It was a compulsion, an addiction, and she didn't know how to stop it. She had to hear his haggard breath. She had to try and get him to speak. She… she just had to try… Her eyes began to burn again as she thought about the shape Johnny must have been in. Her imagination was bad, but something told her the truth was worse. It had been years since she physically spoke to him and even then it was contentious. She'd tried to talk some sense into him, tried to get him into a clinic, but Johnny wouldn't have it. Freshly high on some powdery mix, he lost his temper, yelled and told her to never come back. She didn't, and the phone calls began shortly after. With a heavy sigh, Andy wiped the growing tears from her eyes and pushed herself to her feet. She had to get ready for the day, regardless of how much she didn't want to. ~!~ A few days had passed and Andy was beginning to sleep again. The hope that Johnny was going to call began to dwindle and it helped her relax, in some ways. On the flip-side of that coin, Johnny could have finally overdosed. A waiter came by and refilled Andy's water. She thanked him and took a sip of it. No sooner than she set it down did she see the one she'd been waiting on enter the small restaurant. He wove his broad frame through the tightly packed tables and made his way towards her with a sad look on his face. Andy stood to meet him. \"Sorry I'm late, beautiful.\" He greeted as he wrapped his arms around her. Andy returned the affection and squeezed him tightly. \"No worries, uncle Arch.\" She replied. As they parted, Archy kissed Andy's cheek and together they sat. \"You ordered yet, darlin'?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"Good.\" He raised his hand to silently flag down a passing waiter. The man who'd filled Andy's water only a few minutes prior returned. Archy ordered himself something easy to make and simple –a salad- because he never had long before Lenny called for something else. Andy knew as much and ordered the same. \"So uh,\" he chimed after the waiter walked away. His odd beginning statement drew her attention. Andy noticed the sadness return and his eyes dart away from hers. Archy wasn't a timid person, so when he acted like this, it frightened her. The last time was when he told Andy her mother had passed. \"What?\" she asked apprehensively. Archy continued to 'twiddle his thumbs' before eventually meeting her gaze. She was already on edge and that hadn't been his intention. \"It's 'bout Johnny.\" Andy tightened her jaw and leaned back in her seat. Crossing her arms protectively over her chest, Andy looked away. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" She muttered with an edge. Archy's brows came together in confusion. \"Talk 'bout what?\" he asked. She looked down briefly. \"He called me again,\" she admitted, \"A few days back.\" Archy sighed and shook his head. He was well aware of Johnny's proclivity for the late-night calls. \"This ain't got nothin' to do with that, darlin'.\" He said under his breath. When he began to fidget, Andy looked up. Archy was busy digging into the pocket of the jacket he'd tossed over the back of his chair. He retrieved a newspaper and reluctantly handed it to her. Confused, Andy took the paper. She wondered why he was offering her the periodical when he had something to say about Johnny. Maybe it was another smear campaign about the rocker? Maybe they'd caught him vomiting over the edge of a hotel balcony again and thought it would be a nice way to sell some papers? That wasn't it. That wasn't it at all. When her eyes fell to the black and white print, Andy felt her stomach turn. The paper was already folded so the article in question was front and center. She saw it immediately and it twisted her insides. Andy's eyes began to glass over. \" Singer Johnny Quid is believed dead after falling from a yacht. His body has yet to be recovered.\" The phrase, his body has yet to be recovered, caught in her throat despite her only having read it. It tasted disgusting. Andy's eyes slowly drifted shut and her hands fell, letting the paper land gently against the table. Archy's heart broke when he saw the thin, silvery trails of tears glide gradually down her cheeks. After a steadying breath or two, Andy opened her eyes again and looked once more to the paper. She propped an elbow on the table and buried her lips in her fingers. She just had trouble believing it. That didn't mean, however, that a small part didn't fear it was true. Eventually, she began to shake her head. \"No,\" she shook her head. Her voice trembled and she sniffed before setting the paper down. \"No.\" Andy met Archy's remorseful stare. \"That's not right.\" His brows furrowed tighter than before. \"Andy,\" he sighed softly. \"No,\" she snapped with authority. She jabbed her index finger firmly into the tabletop as though it would help make her statement true, and while she tried to remain strong, her exterior was fracturing. \"He's not dead. He's fine. He's just…\" she couldn't form an immediate lie. \"He's fine.\" The table they sat around was small. Archy could easily move closer to his niece and did when it became clear she wasn't taking the news well. Archy slid his chair a few feet around the circular table until he was at her side. \"Come here,\" he whispered as he put an arm around her shoulder. While neither wanted to make a scene in such a public place, neither seemed to have much of a choice. So, Archy threaded his arm around her shoulders and pulled Andy into a half-hug. She fell into his guidance and struggled to keep from crying outright. It wouldn't be pretty if she did, and more than a few eyes would glide their way. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered into the top of her head before kissing her softly. \"I'm sorry, swee'heart.\" Andy shook her head, but denying the information wouldn't make it any less true. They remained that way for a few minutes until their food arrived. When it had, Andy straightened herself, wiped the tears from her cheeks and did her best to act normal. Archy returned to his side of the table. They barely made it half-way through their meals before Len called, barking orders at Archy like he always did. Archy wasn't happy about it, but didn't really have a choice. \"I don't like that man.\" Andy mumbled as she rose to hug Archy. \"Len's not so bad.\" He felt the need to say. She believed his lie as much as he did -not at all. \"I'll give ya a call later, yeah?\" he asked as they parted. Andy nodded. Archy dug into his pocket and pulled out a decent bit of cash. He set it on the table for their meals and anything else Andy may need. Before he left, Archy threaded his arm around her waist, pulled her towards him once more and kissed her forehead. He forced a smile and said a final farewell before leaving to wipe Len's ass. Andy sank back into her seat. Her eyes fell to the newspaper Archy hadn't taken with him. It didn't seem right to see Johnny's face staring back at her like it was… ~!~ When she made it home that night, Andy still held the newspaper. She took it with her upstairs and to the spare bedroom. Tossing it onto the bed, Andy knelt down and reached beneath the frame to retrieve a box. She pulled it out, took a seat on the guest bed and opened the lid. The box was filled with photographs and stupid trinkets. She took out a small handful of them and looked over the glossy images. They were millisecond shots of times everyone could pretend life was better. It was a box of Johnny. Andy flipped through the pictures that spanned over a decade. A couple was of her and a young Johnny Quid, others of him on his own and a few recent photos of them in their twenties. Her favorite was one taken just a few years ago –roughly six- of the both of them. Andy had taken a selfie and in order to fit, Johnny had looped his arm around her neck, pulled her close enough to smash their faces together and gave the camera a 'Billy Idol' sneer. It was just before one of his concerts backstage and the last picture she had of him even remotely sober. Setting them aside, Andy fished out the concert ticket stubs she had for the Quid Lickers and set them on the pictures. At the bottom of the box were other newspapers. Each one of them held news of Johnny's death. She knew it was morbid to keep them, but part of her was superstitious about it. Every time she'd saved his death-notice, Johnny ended up being alive. It was a tradition and she felt like if she didn't add this one, it may become true. The tears came again. There was the hope he was alive, the desire to believe he hadn't finally killed himself, but the fear was stronger. The fear refused to be ignored. The fear of him succeeding was all encompassing. \" Babe!\" The voice echoing through the house brought her out of her thoughts. Andy quickly tossed everything back into the box and shoved it once more beneath the bed before hearing Adam jogging up the steps. She quickly tried to appear as normal as she could. She didn't feel like telling Adam –yet again- that Johnny was dead. He received the knowledge about as well as he did the phone calls. ~!~ Somewhere, hidden within the shadows of a decrepit building, Johnny took another long, deep pull of a cigarette. He was riding the waves of his latest high and happily sank further into the over-stuffed, craggy couch. A lazy grin spread across his lips as a thought entered his mind. Reaching for his burner phone, Johnny turned it on and highlighted the only number in the contact list. All he had to do was press call . ~!~ Andy was in the shower and her phone was resting on the end table in her bedroom charging. Adam was getting ready for bed when it lit up and began to ring. He reached for it with every intention of calling out to ask if she wanted it answered or not until he saw the name flashing back. Adam's demeanor immediately turned dark and anger took hold. Without hesitation, he unplugged the small mobile and answered the call. \"Hello?\" he snapped. The line was silent, which he'd learned was common. \"Listen, I don' know if you're him, or not,\" he said tensely, \"But you need to stop fuckin' callin' her, you hear me?\" No response. Adam's anger grew. \"I ain't fuckin' havin' it anymore.\" His voice was low and threatening. \"Just go and fuckin' die already.\" Adam heard the water cut off and immediately ended the call. He set the phone down just as the door to the bathroom opened. She gave him a light smile and reached for her nightclothes. \"I'm gonna brush my teeth.\" Adam suddenly chimed. He moved passed her quickly and into the bathroom. Andy' eyes narrowed. Adam seemed nervous and uncomfortable, which was odd since as far as she knew, nothing had happened. Shaking her head and choosing to ignore his strangeness, Andy began to pull on her nightclothes when she noticed her phone. It was sitting at a strange angle and nowhere near her charger. She finished threading her arms through the sleeves of her shirt and reached for it. Andy easily went through the device to find out what –if anything- was different. Sure enough, a new call had been added to her history and it made her stomach churn. It was either a cruel joke or someone with Johnny's phone trying to find out who the number belonged to. The fact that he could be alive –sadly- hadn't entered her mind. ~!~ Johnny was staring angrily at his phone; still eying it like the one who'd spoken to him would somehow come through the speakers. \"Who the fuck was that?\" he asked angrily. \"Oo's who, John?\" Pete asked groggily. He'd taken a recent hit of the pipe and was freshly enthralled by its grip. \"No one, Pedro.\" Johnny mumbled as he turned his mobile off and tossed it to the side. Johnny's brows remained fixed in a frown. He knew Andy' number hadn't changed, so who the hell had picked it up? And where did he get off telling Johnny to go off and die? Fuck that guy. Johnny didn't like him. ~!~ Pete was asleep in a lump on the couch while Johnny sat in his chair watching another block of re-run cartoons. He loved cartoons as a kid. Now was no different. As he sat and watched the mouse blow up a stick of dynamite in the cat's face, his mind wandered to the 'conversation' he had two days ago. A random man had answered Andy's cell phone. While he never openly expected her to keep her life on hold until he was ready to pull his head out of his ass, secretly, he kind of did. He took another pull from his cigarette as he thought about Andy. They'd known each other since they were roughly ten. She was ten, he was twelve. Andy had randomly appeared between school years. Evidently her mother –Archy's little sister- had died and the kid had nowhere else to go. Len was less than happy about his right-hand-man being tied down to a kid, which immediately endeared her to Johnny. He instantly liked anyone that pissed Lenny off. She didn't speak a lot at first, which didn't really surprise anyone. Archy was nervous about having to care for her when she seemed 'broken'. While he'd been around plenty of kids through the years, he'd never been in charge of one, let alone a little girl. He was at a loss and decided at first to enroll her in a posh girl's school. Len was all about getting rid of the brat. Years passed and through their respective guardians, Johnny and Andy were forced to spend their spare time together. It wasn't uncommon for the two to be dumped off with a nanny of some kind while Archy and Lenny worked. As a result, they became reluctant friends. It wasn't until they were teens that they realized they had some things in common. Each of them loved music and would gladly blast whatever they had on hand –rock, oldies, pop, etc- just to drown out everything else. For the two or three minutes of each song, they were allowed to forget about the bullshit their lives were. Though in truth, Johnny's was slowly growing worse while Andy's had leveled out. Johnny stamped out his dying cigarette as he remembered what made him love Andy. Before, he liked her well enough, but it wasn't until his mom died that Johnny began to love her. Len was still going on about how of course she fuckin' killed herself and it's 'cause she finally had enough of you and your fuckin' face . Johnny was stone-faced the entire time as he was assaulted by his step-father. He was too lost in his thoughts to really care about what the old man spouted. At some point, Lenny bellowed get the fuck out, I can't even look at ya to which Johnny gladly did. He needed something, a drink perhaps, to simply dull his world. After finding a joint he still had left over from who-knows-when, Johnny took a seat beneath a large tree he and Andy used to hide in when they were escaping the warden… the nanny, when they were escaping the nanny. He didn't hesitate to light it and fill his lungs with the numbing smoke. Andy eventually found him and sat down on the protruding roots next to him long after the joint was gone. She leaned over and rested her head on his shoulder. Johnny was only beginning to register what Lenny told him. The news was finally breaking through the wall in his head that kept him from understanding his last bit of family was gone. Remorse wasn't his first reaction either. It was anger. He remembered spewing hateful words, calling his mother weak, a bitch and all other manner of awful things because he blamed her for leaving him. He blamed her for leaving him with someone like Lenny. Andy let him yell, and stand, and pace, and shake with rage. She didn't speak for awhile until he seemed to calm. Andy leaned forward, grabbed his hand, pulled him back to the ground to sit, and wrapped her arms around him. Johnny remembered his back pressed to her chest as she rested against the tree and encircled him with her arms. Being surrounded by someone who genuinely cared about him made Johnny feel safe, and it helped calm him further. It wasn't until then that he started to blame himself. Once the anger was gone, Johnny began to think that perhaps Len had a point. One thing she said stuck with him. She didn't do this because of you. She did it because of him. Len drove her to it. She just wanted to escape him and she thought this was the only way. Her words resonated with him and made Johnny hate Lenny even more than he already did, which was a bit surprising. They stayed like that for hours until long after the sun had set. He'd gone through the gamut of emotions in the meantime and Andy never said anything. After those few words about his mother, she remained silent and let him go through whatever he had to go through. She just held him. It was the first time anyone had unconditionally cared for him. She did nothing but try to comfort him. No one had ever done that before and it made him love her. The urge to call Andy came again and somehow, Johnny was able to resist. It was difficult, but he managed to stop himself before pressing call . He managed to keep from bringing her into the depths of his depravity. It had been nearly two weeks since his 'death' which meant she'd already mourned. He knew he should let her continue to think he was dead and was actually a little glad that bloke had answered the phone instead of her. Calling Andy would just be a cruel form of torture, and he couldn't do that to someone he actually cared about. Not anymore. ~!~ Andy opened the heavy wooden door and entered the hushed room. Men in robes and wigs dotted the area ahead of her. Within the pews nearest the door, Andy saw a few familiar faces. She headed for the aisle and slid into place beside the man with his arms resting along the back of the wooden bench. \"'Ey, Candy Girl.\" Mumbles greeted in a hushed tone. \"What you doin' here, then?\" \"I hate it when you call me that.\" She replied under her breath. He chuckled. \"Uncle told me Bob was comin' in today.\" \"Yeah,\" he sighed. Mumbles leaned back in his seat and nodded. His smirk was gone. \"He's lookin' at a five.\" \"Shit,\" she sighed. \"Robbery?\" \"Yeah,\" he nodded again. He looked once more to the young woman at his side. His arm was still on the back of the pew behind her. Using the angle, he gently scratched her back between her shoulder blades with his thumb. It caused her to look at him. \"Ain't seen you 'round for awhile. Where ya been?\" \"Workin', mostly.\" She said. \"I've realized ya got to work twice as hard, when it's honest.\" He smiled and chuckled under his breath. A few more people began to spill into the courtroom. She knew them all whether by name or reputation. Most of them worked for Len or Archy, but all of them were there for Bob. After the judge passed sentencing on the current prisoner he was led out of the courtroom. Someone bellowed loudly to declare who was coming next. It was Bob. The young man was guided into the courtroom looking thoroughly terrified as the officers led him to the defendant's box. Bob noticed his friends scattered within the public seating area and felt better for it, but it wasn't enough to ease his fear. The councilors gathered what they needed, but something was wrong and Andy noticed. She saw the prosecutor nervously searching through his things. She elbowed Mumbles and pointed at the lawyer. Mumbles narrowed his eyes but began to smirk when he realized what was happening. \"Uh-oh,\" he grinned, \"Looks like someone's lost his papers.\" Sure enough, when the judge asked for the evidence, the prosecutor had to reluctantly reply that there was none. Bob and everyone in the audience began to shift and murmur amongst themselves. They weren't sure they'd heard him right until he repeated the statement loudly. The judge was furious. He yelled at the man for wasting his time as well as everyone else's. Reluctantly, he dismissed the case. Bob's head snapped to his friends. His expression was twisted between relief and disbelief as his cuffs were unlocked. Chuckling, he rubbed his wrists, offered an excited cheers to the prison officer who'd undone them and practically jogged towards the doors. He didn't want to risk them finding whatever was lost before he got out of there. In the halls, his friends offered him congratulations and Andy was among them. \"What you doin' here?\" he asked as he wrapped his arms around the young woman and hugged her tight. \"Wanted to come offer support.\" She said as they parted. \"Well thanks, Andy.\" He beamed. He couldn't stop smiling, but it slowly began to fade. \"Where's One-Two?\" The others didn't seem to realize the Scot was missing and could do nothing more than offer shrugs. \"I'm sure he just got caught up, or somethin'.\" Mumbles offered. Bob's smile was gone, but he nodded as though doing his best to accept the answer. \"Come on then Bob,\" Fred chimed as he wrapped an arm around the former defendant. \"Let's get you a drink, yeah?\" \"Yeah,\" Bob nodded. The group began to head for the front door. Mumbles turned and pointed at Andy. \"You comin', darlin'?\" Andy hesitated. She didn't want to say no outright, but Mumbles seemed to realize that's the direction she was leaning. \"Come on,\" he drew the words out and added a charming smile to help entice her. \"Jus' a couple of drinks. Ya owe us that much, ain't been 'round in months.\" A light smile touched her lips and Andy shook her head. \"Fine,\" she sighed. \"I suppose I can have a drink or two.\" \"There she is!\" he clapped his hands together in one thunderous, victorious sound, looped his arm over her shoulder and walked her out of the courthouse. His reaction caused Andy to let out an actual laugh, the first in weeks. Mumbles wasn't wrong. It had been months since she'd seen any of the Wild Bunch. After getting together with Adam and her friendship with Johnny broke, her connection to them had become thin. While she liked them much more than her uncle did and liked spending time with them, her life had very much gotten in the way. Besides, it was hard to spend time with people when her fiancé didn't know the kind of people they really were. There were only so many times she could say she was going out with friends before he wanted to meet them. As she followed the others out with Mumbles at her side, Andy caught sight of Cookie. That was someone she wanted to speak to.

He didn't know why. The Rocknrolla looked around the dingy apartment he shared with Pete. The other junkie was no where to be seen. Johnny stood, sweatpants hanging from his slim hips, and loped over to the window. Despite being in a rather bad neighborhood, okay it was a shit-hole, the singer had a rather good view of the city. His city. He had a clear, if somewhat muggy, view of River Thames and the industrial district on the other side. It was beautiful, really, especially since none of it was controlled by one Lenny Cole. Johnny spat out the broken window as the thought of his step-father crossed his mind. He heard the door open and close, but didn't bother to turn around. \"What's up, Johnny?\" a smooth voice asked. \"Nothn', love,\" he mumbled, turning from the view to his lover. \"You sure?\" she asked. \"No,\" he answered truthfully. \"Tell me what's wrong, sweet. You're not high. You're not drunk. As much as I love it when you're sober, Johnny, it's not a normal occurrence.\" The brunette shed her jacket and took a few steps toward him, avoiding old news papers, dirty clothes, and used needles in the floor. \"You like it when I'm sober?\" Johnny asked quietly. \"As much of a dickhead you are; yes, I like it when you're sober.\" She wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Why?\" \"You're not you, when you're high. You're not the Johnny Quid I grew up knowing.

It was not too late at night at this moment, but because of a recent collective mass hysteria that had taken over the town; everyone within their frightened frame of mind took it upon themselves and their children to stay inside, and stay safe. Except for one, lone trench coat swathed figure that trudged their way through the lifeless streets, head down in desperation to keep their face dry from the unforgiving rain. Though they could not help themselves at times to peek out from the rim of their hat to see the houses that crowded the street, the warm light peeking through heavy grey curtains telling of a happy and safe home, a look of yearning passing through their features that causes them to walk faster every time. It was getting to closer to curfew now, and if they weren't careful, they would be caught. Though whether they were caught by the Red Hats or the Box trolls it made no difference, both were bad news. Box Trolls were of course the creatures that were causing such empty-street, house-filled hysteria amongst the masses, whispers trailing from one gossiping wife to another of what they did to careless parents and their innocent children in the cover of night. Of course these whispers had been around for as long as anyone could remember, it was just natural for one to fear what they do not understand or have actually seen with their own eyes. But the statements that were once meant to put fear in the hearts of misbehaving children at bedtime had now evolved so suddenly into frightened whispers, and mothers clutching tighter to their children's shoulders, afraid to let them play before dark for fear that they would never be seen again. Something was riling these people up more than usual, and now all it seemed it would take was for one incident to confirm their fears, then the town would truly be lost to their Box Troll fear frenzy. The Red Hats were a culmination of all these fears and theories, a collection of men that would go out into the night and capture the creatures before they could harm any parent or child. Naturally these men were placed in nearly the highest regard, the top place belonging to those of the White Hat society, best known for giving Cheesebridge its name and their fancy ways. It was because these Red Hats were so nearly higher up on the social ladder, (at least higher up than the figure walking through the streets knew they would ever be,) that they had the authority to lock up those that refused their order of curfew, the exact reason why the figure was now walking so fast that they could feel the pull of the muscles in their legs. Being locked up by The Red Hats was worse than any kind of lock up by the law enforcers, since most people in the public jail were released into the sunlight. Those that were caught past curfew by the Red Hats however, not so much. After passing many houses and avoiding the Red Hats motor cars as best as they could, trying to hold back their coughing as the vicious black smoke from the engines leaked into the already dreary night and strangled their lungs, they eventually arrived to their destination. The house that was awaiting from the top of the steps was not shout inward like the others, the lights that made it seem so warm and friendly shining out without any curtains to stop it. This already giving the outward representation that whoever was the master of this household, did not fear the dreaded fate that came from the Box Trolls. And certainly, the figure reflected as they climbed up the last of the rain covered steps and wiped their shoes dry on the welcome mat, that was true. A series of secret password knocks later and the door was opened to the figure, whom after finally getting out of the cold; shed themselves from their second skin of wet trench coat and wide brimmed hat to greet the one that had let them in. As the weather protection guise was discarded, it revealed the young lady it had been hiding underneath. She looked no older than sixteen; her build best described as thin as a rake, and she not all that attractive, though that was to say she wasn't completely ugly either. Mostly it was because of the always cautiously glaring expression on her face that she used to guard herself that she was found to be unpretty yet pretty. With her wild brown hair that she had managed to strangle back into a tightened ponytail and vivid green eyes, she was nearly an exact replica of the man whom had let her in. (Except she was female of course and he had a rather bid moustache that twitched when he was amused). This would make sense, given that it was her father. \"Ah Olive I was wondering when you'd be getting back,\" He exclaimed, his tone showing that he was neither joking nor angry, but actually genuine in his statement since it was clear that he would be a great deal more worried if she had been a second later than usual. It was because of his voice that seemed to show such happiness at a time when the teenager had begun to think had been supped from this town that her glare melted into a relieved smile, showing some of the pretty that she had managed to inherit from her mother. From her father's arms came a gurgle and giggle of delight, the voice being so small, but then again that best suited the source of it. For in her father's arms was Olive's only little brother, a small baby that looked close to a year old since his brown hair now covered his head and his eyes shined the same color as his sister and father's. His small hands reached out to her, and she gladly takes him from the arms of her father to wrap him up in her own, whispering a small apology to the baby that she was so cold form the rain and the night winds before she looked back up to her father. \"Sorry I'm so late; I had to stay at the seamstress' for some extra pay,\" Of course when the teenager said 'extra pay', she really meant the one silver coin more than usual that she places in her father's hand, which sometimes didn't feel worth the effort of nearly being snatched up by the Red Hats, but for some reason she does it anyway. The teenager walks quickly through the house, which was small yet homely, and places her little brother in his small cot to play with his few toys that she had sown back together so many times they had become patchwork creations. She tightens her already tight ponytail and starts to ready dinner for them all, stopping only when she feels a brush on her leg. She looks down, and sees the one thing that was always causing her so much grievance lately that she doesn't sleep at night anymore, instead she stays awake and constantly thinks of what could happen to her family because of it. It's what has been making her glare more often; making her worker later at night only to come home and see the sadness in her father's eyes because he thinks that she just 'doesn't understand'. What she sees is a Box Troll, specifically one that her father named 'Fish'. Her father says that they aren't the monsters everyone from Red Hat to Baker thinks they are. That in reality they are builders, genius inventors like himself and don't mean any harm. Olive wants to believe him, really she does, but it's not a crisis of faith in her father that keeps her up at night. It was the thought that if they were caught housing Box Trolls of any kind, or even uttering a word of positivity about them, that she would never see her father again because of it. Her brother would be taken from her and she, she would be left alone, more alone than she had ever been when her mother died. The teenager had tried to tell him before, trying to convince him that this is not the right thing to do, that her father, her and even the baby were in danger every time they entered the house, whatever their intentions may be. But of course, he never understands. \"They are our guests here Olive Trubshaw,\" he would say (using her full name always meant he was particularly serious), gesturing to the Box Troll he had been defending (who was chewing on a boot at the time, but that was nothing when accompanied by everything else she had seen them do). She would beg, and plead and even at one point yelled (something she felt particularly bad over) but nothing ever worked, so now she had just decided to at least try to get used to them, while also praying every night that they would not be her father's downfall. So instead of complaining as she usually did, Olive gave a small wave to Fish before returning to her work in the small table that was used as a Kitchen. Certainly Olive had not seen any blood thirsty behavior from this Box Troll at least, mostly he usually attempted to steal meat balls from the table while she was trying to cook, an action she would react by glaring halfheartedly at him for before rolling her eyes, trying not to show that he was growing on her day by day, bit by bit. When dinner was made and they all sat down to eat, (the Box Trolls sometimes staying for a bite before going back to wherever they lived), there would never be an actual quiet moment. The table was always open to discussion, theorizing and planning between Olive and her father, the baby sometimes interceding with gurgles of opinion that made the sixteen year old laugh. Her father knew she was no longer a child, and so felt as though she should have a voice to speak and an opinion to have as a young lady. And she would revel in it with complete enjoyment and a constant quest for enlightenment, having conversations that she wasn't allowed to have anywhere else, since everywhere else told her to hold her tongue and that no one wanted to hear her. But her father's ear was always one she could speak to about anything, and it made her feel safer than any sense of the word that a Red Hat could ever falsely supply. Certainly, unlike elsewhere in this town there was no talk of her getting married, her father feeling that if she said she was not ready, then that was exactly the end of that topic. However, there was also a part of the teenager that knew he felt that if she left now, there would be no motherly figure for the baby to learn empathy from as he grew from a small seedling to a full sprout of a boy. He never said so aloud, but she did sometimes see on nights when he was particularly tired, how much he missed her mother. It was that expression more than anything, that made her determined to stay and keep this family together. Every once in a while though, when the night seemed its darkest and the baby was fast asleep, there would a sudden and loud knocking on the front door. If any Box Trolls were in the house they were snuck out the window that faced an unused alleyway, and Olive would be ordered to her room and to not come out for any reason until this visitor had gone. Being a good child at heart Olive would do as she was told, but that did not mean she wouldn't sneak out every so often to peek at who this visitor was that always had her father on edge before the first knock on the door even ended. The red hat and coat always was the first thing she saw as this man took a seat at their table, sometimes taking a few moments to peer around the room as if he were looking for something that he never had the evidence to prove before sitting down. The second thing would be his voice; the low and almost rumbling tones that made her insides feel a little sicker than normal, and made her flesh crawl more than any Box Troll would be capable of making her feel. This man was Archibald Snatcher, head of the Red Hats and major exterminator of Box Trolls in all of Cheesebridge. His face suited his voice, gaunt yet round with a crooked nose that seemed to tell of every fight he'd once had where a punch had created every crook. His eyes were small yet sneaky, as if he could see around every corner before he had even turned to face it. His mind was clearly always on the future, his plans for that future however, never seemed to spell anything good for anyone but himself. What this man wanted with their family, Olive was never truly sure, since she only ever heard snippets and sometimes a raised voice, which was usually always from Mr. Snatcher. One time, about a few months before this point, a younger Olive had been peeping around the corner the lead into her room, sneaking looks at their conversation while eavesdropping longer than she ever had before. What she heard made her feel sicker than she ever had before. \"- I will not do what you ask of me!\" That was her father, his stance more defensive yet confrontational than she had ever seen it whenever she stood before him in her life. Mr. Snatcher was never threatened by him however, and would instead just tower over him, usually silent before turning and leaving with a sharp bang of the front door. This time however, there was a look in his eye that had no been there before. The small irises of his darting very quickly to the corner that Olive was hiding behind, almost causing her to gasp and jump from fear as she hid from his sight. \"How old is your little Olive again Mr. Trubshaw? Nearly of age to be married off soon I'd take it?\" Sensing the subtlety in his comment was the worst thing that Olive reckoned at that moment that she had ever done. It was at this time, as she hid behind that corner and watched as her father seemed to deflate slightly at the veiled threat towards his only daughter, that the young girl decided that she was never, ever going to marry. Never going to leave her father's side for as long as she knew she had a say in it. Despite what the popular opinion of Cheesebridge liked to state otherwise. The grotesque man then, with a turn on his heel and a grin that showed his missing and yellowed teeth, left with yet another sharp bang of the door closing behind him. As soon as he was gone she dropped all pretense of her father at least having the blessing that she hadn't heard that, by running from her hiding place to find comfort in his arms like she had as a child. Olive whimpered to him then as she felt the safety of his arms holding her tight, that she did not want to be married, and that even if she did, she certainly did not want to marry Mr. Snatcher. \"You won't,\" He assured her, then after an hour's more coaxing and promises that the frightening man was not going to now steal her away in the night while she slept, Olive allowed him to carry her back to bed like he use to when she was a little girl, leaving her only for a moment in her bed as he fetched her little brother from his coat and placed him next to her. Then, her father's hand gently touched her brow as he whispered a tune she only vaguely recognized Olive eventually fell asleep, the small sounds of her brother's whistling baby snore helping her along the way with the strange little ditty her father was humming. Little Boxes on the hillside, Little Boxes made of ticky tacky Little Boxes on the hillside, Little Boxes all the same… It seemed like this sense of being on their toes, seconds away from being caught or something terrible happening, would continue on forever. But of course it didn't, of course it had to end. That morning was like any other, she was awake earlier than everyone else, made breakfast for her father and brother, cleaned up the mess her baby brother had made that had once been that breakfast. Then got ready to leave for the seamstress that she was apprenticed to at the time, the one that sometimes paid her an extra coin should she waste more time there than with her family. On the last morning that this would ever be her routine (not that she knew it at the time), she kissed her little brother's small forehead and hugged her father tight. \"Be safe,\" She muttered, just a common thing that she always said before she left, since she always hated saying goodbye. Her father hummed in response and she was soon out the door, the sunlight that burned at her tired eyelids the moment she stood into it wiping her mind on any thought that her family wouldn't be anything but safe that day. After a hard and thankless day's work with the seamstress, the sixteen year old left there much later than usual that night and she quickly started her trek home, the lights that escaped through cracks of heavy curtains helping her to see her way through the dark cobbled streets back to what she knew as the brightest and most inviting house of them all, the house where her loved ones were waiting for her. She had delicately stuck to the shadows when the Red Hat cars drove by, and eventually made it to what she knew as the front steps of her home. Only, when she looked up the steps, there was no inviting glow of light that unlike the other houses was not trapped away from actual sight. Nothing but darkness seemed to be up ahead, shadows that were otherwise vanquished by the light, now hiding the home from her view. It was this one sight of what anyone else wouldn't notice, that had her heartbeat go from zero to sixty in a second. Her footsteps were now shaken as she tried to scale the stairs, the usually short climb feeling like an eternity as her mind tried to both reasonably calm her down, and completely freak out as to what might have happened. As she climbed up she tried to see or hear out any evidence that she was just scaring herself and that everything is alright. She tried to detect the music that usually flowed from inside, only to hear nothing but the hollow wind against her ears. She tried to see any familiar shadows of familiar Box Trolls in alleyways nearby telling her that they were sneaking in to spend the night, only to see nothing but the odd stray cat. When Olive finally reached the top of the steps, her heart that was once beating so fast, now leapt up into her throat in an attempt to escape this nightmare that was only just beginning. The front door was just about hanging off its top hinges only, hanging open to the darkness that waited for her inside. A hand delicately touched her mouth, trying to hide the quivering lip of fear as she managed to swallow it back and walk inside. The house was shrouded in so much darkness, that the teenager had to squint to see through it, her childish fears of the dark all the while playing in the back of her head like a never ending record she hated to hear but could never forget. And as she managed to pass the threshold of the front door and try to walk further in as her footsteps seemed to echo, a thought struck her like lightening. This was the first time that she had ever felt like a stranger here, in her own home. Something was wrong. Suddenly, as soon as that thought looses relevance, a candle is lit in the kitchen, chasing some of the shadows away. Wanting to focus on the relief and ignore the oncoming dread that felt more like a storm in her mind, Olive walks quickly towards the inviting light as if it were a light house and she was lost at sea. She was expecting, or rather wanting it to really be her father at the table looking guilty at scaring her so badly and having some silly explanation like he needed the hinges on the door for something in his inventions, or that the baby was already asleep so he saw no reason to have the lights on and that he was sorry. She just wanted it to be an occasion where nothing was wrong, and that he was sorry. But it wasn't. It wasn't even her father that was sitting at the table, awaiting her approach. No, what sat at the end of the table, where her father usually was when he was working on an invention or having those meaningful discussions with Olive, was certainly not the man she felt most safe with. Instead it was the man that gave her more nightmares in one night than any tale of the boogeyman or a Box Troll could ever manage. A man who had watched her come closer to the table much like a spider watches a fly come closer to its web. Mr. Snatcher. \"Miss Trubshaw, I'm sorry to say that it is in such terrible circumstances that I greet your lovely presence tonight,\" The man stood from his seat, swiping the oddly crooked Red Hat from his head and held it against his stomach, his terribly ugly face attempting to pull an expression that could best be described between sadness and looking as though he had smelt something rather bad recently. But that was not what Olive cared about right then, and instead got straight to the point, she so hated niceties after all. \"Where is my father? Where is the baby?\" Olive only got more upset the longer the answer was not spoken. Mr. Snatcher looked as though he were now holding back a smirk, and instead looked down so he figured she wouldn't see it. But again, she didn't care, she just wanted her answer. When she got her answer however, she wished from that point on that she had remained blissfully ignorant. \"My dear lady, I know it might injure your weak heart to hear this. But I'm sorry to inform you that your poor father and innocent infant brother have become victims of the dreaded Box Trolls.\" At first she tries to deny it. \"They're… they're dead?\" But that doesn't work. \"I'm afraid so,\" She could feel her heart stop in that moment, while her brain tried to catch up and decode what he had said, and when it does, her grief takes over. Her knees fail her and she crashes to the hardwood floor, her hands gripping at her face as she screams bloody murder, every ounce of pain and sadness that could come from that one moment finding its way out of her lungs and voice box, and into the air. Her blood curdling, heart wrenching scream echoes through the streets of Cheesebridge, cracking windows and deafening dogs with its dexterity. Every man, woman and child would later state that their bones felt rattled from the sound, tears forced to their eyes though at the time they weren't exactly sure why. But Olive knew and from that point on she would always know why. She told them to be safe, because she hated saying goodbye. That was the last time she ever stepped foot into that house, the property soon being bought and sold to another person of the town that she did not care to know since they certainly did not care about her. All of her family's possessions, at least those that she had not been able to take with her, were scrapped away. Her father's inventions, her brothers little shoes, even her first tooth. They seemed so inconsequential on the bigger scale, but knowing that they were now considered trash, destroyed something inside her all the more. She was taken to stay in a half way house for a while until one of the White Hats of Cheesebridge would finally bother to notice her and deal with the problem. It took two months, which was actually a relief since many people had told her not to bother with them, or that it might take two years before they finally got around to it. In any case, two months later she was visited in her room at the temporary lodgings by one of the White Hats, Lord Portley-Rind. \"Miss Trubshaw, how sad the circumstances are that we finally meet,\" Lord Portley-Rind bowed low, and since she doesn't have anyone anymore that knows she hates social niceties, she curtsies back for the first time. It feels degrading to her somehow, like the deaths of her family have tamed the way she had once been. However, this seems to make a good impression on him as he smiles back at her. Olive eventually sits back in her chair, the Lord himself not bothering to sit down since the available chairs were probably too dirty to him. \"Indeed this is a tragedy sir, which only seems to lighten somewhat at your presence,\" The compliment humbled him, which was of course its intention anyway. The conversation does not go very long as she was informed of her home being sold and everything that she didn't take with her being gone. It felt so finalized without even a word from her, as if this were all planned before it even happened. But then Olive realized that even if it weren't planned ahead of this tragedy, she still probably wouldn't have gotten a say anyway. Thinking was now a terrible issue of hers, since every thought in her head seemed to now always lead back to the same thing. The knowledge that her family, was dead. It was so hard to really grasp despite it continuously appearing in her mind, and what was worse was that she wasn't completely sure why it was hard to understand in the first place. Perhaps it was just the simple fact that apparently it was Box Trolls that had done this unspeakable crime to her and her family. The same Box Trolls that only ever really stole meatball off the counter when she was cooking, but otherwise did nothing to antagonize her father or herself, never seemed to be a threat to the baby. Nothing from her memories seemed to draw the conclusion or even slightly foreshadow that this was what they were planning. A tear misplaced its way across her cheek, and she apologized to the White Hat Lord as she wiped it away. That to seemed to also happen frequently, some days she would seem fine, and then she just wouldn't be. Some days she couldn't manage to get out of bed, looking instead to the ceiling as though it would have the answers on what she should do. Others she would wake up and not remember what happened, and then she remembered. Those days were the worst of all. \"Now Miss Trubshaw, I do believe we need to discuss your options of a future,\" Everything in her body froze on the spot, her eyes looking back to him like a deer caught in headlights as only one thing came to mind when the words options and future where mentioned. That one thing being the memory from a few months ago, back when her family was still there and her father could protect her, Mr. Snatcher standing over her father as he asks if she was 'old enough to marry' yet. And before she can really question anything her skin feels like it is crawling once again, but now she wants to crawl away with it and not answer this horrible question. But she has to, because she is not a child anymore so it wasn't as if she could run away from it any more she could forget how the doors hinges squeaked while barely holding onto the wood. She swallows the memory back and answers with as much a confident voice as she can manage without crying again. \"I do not think that the possibility of marriage should be allowed into question my Lord, for I fear this tragedy will forever scar my ability to be a proper wife to any good sir in this town. Especially since there is a chance that since the Box Trolls love the taste of Trubshaw, there is a chance that I will be next,\" It's a lie, a horrible, heart cutting lie that made her feel a little sick inside, but still she tried to sell it with all the fake conviction she could cook up in the short time allowed. She bashes her eyelids, wipes the tears away, practically doing everything so she seemed so small and frail. Anything to get her away from the possibility of being married, especially since her father could now no longer chase the hyena like suitors away. It was up to her to do that now. For whatever reason, whether it was because she fluttered her eyelashes at the right time or maybe he figured out her want to just be free from that nightmare while she was still grieving her family, Lord Portley-Rind nodded in agreement. For a moment when he didn't notice, Olive looked at him as though he had two heads, since she was certainly not expecting him to really fall for it. Still, it was pretty great that he had, as instead of the possibility of marriage, he seemed to have another proposition for her. \"My wife and I have just had a daughter of our own, Winifred. She will need a Nanny to look after her while I and my wife are off on important business,\" \"I would love for the chance to be your new child's Nanny your lordship,\" Olive immediately caught on to what it was he was suggesting and agreed almost immediately, since it sounded so many fields better than being on the marriage market, where a certain red hated man would be waiting for her. A contract was signed and agreements were made before she was made to pack her bags and go with him to his manor in the centre of Cheesebridge. Her room was small yet on the highest floor of the manor, though thankfully it was not small enough that she couldn't fit her family's old bits and pieces along with her belongings. What hurt the most sometimes was that when she looked out her window; she could not see her old home. Every building below her did look the exact same as the other next to it after all. Though there was a piece of thankfulness in her heart, since she already knew that if she could see it, all it would do as reminded her on how she could not go back. That everything she had every loved, had been taken in that one night, never to come back. Olive sat silently on her new bed, her hands slowly rubbed at her arms, trying to rid the cold feeling that she had inside, though she already knew that this would not work to make it disappear. So she tried instead on looking around what was now going to be her new home for the next few years. But that of course, only seemed to make her feel worse. A knock on the door stopped her from falling into another pit of despair, and Olive quickly made herself presentable before opening the door. The one knocking had apparently been Lord Portley-Rind, who looked rather troubled with the small bundle of material in his arms. Olive allowed him to quickly enter the room, and he generously did so, taking a moment to look around at her belongings himself before turning back to the young lady. \"Yes, it's all rather interesting,\" He murmured since he couldn't seem to think of anything to say, before the wriggling bundle he was holding so carefully gurgled, small pink hands reaching out from white material to try and grab a hold of his handlebar mustache. It was apparent that his Lordship was having trouble holding the baby, looking at it more as though it were a bomb that was about to go off than a small infant. \"Do you want me to hold her for you, your lordship?\" The Lord seemed completely relieved that the teenager had said it first and carefully handed the small bundle of material and infant into Olive's hands, looking still as though the baby were going to explode any moment from the slightest of too forceful movements. Olive smiled warmly back at him to tell his lordship that he was doing just fine, before looking down at the child that would be under her charge for the rest of the near future. The baby girl was a small thing, her tuffs of ginger curly hair, obviously a trait picked up by her father, sticking out along with her head and arms appearing out of the bundle. Bright greens eyes stared curiously back at her…the same look that she remembered seeing in her brother when she first held him. Olive sniffed back a tear and strengthened the hold of her quivering lip. There would be no more crying, at least not when others could see it. The young woman knew already that this tragedy was going to rule the rest of her life, but she saw no reason to let anyone else know about it. She would keep her composure, by locking her pain away to where no one could see it. \"Hello Winnie, my name's Olive, and I'm very pleased to meet you,\" Please review, constructive criticism always welcome.[Chapter 2] 10 years later. The streets of Cheesebridge remained just as empty on this night as they had been for years, the curfew by this point becoming just a part of life for the people of the town. As did the people's fear of the Box Trolls, which had definitely run rampant in their minds as a genuine and normal fear after the incident of the 'Trubshaw baby'. Children were locked down more tightly, watched at all time to make sure they never strayed from the covers of their beds to the dark world outside. The very center of town was no different, the darkness of night hiding away most of the abandoned streets. If it were this way during the daytime, people would assume this town an ancient deserted city, it was that empty. There was no leniency anymore in allowing the smallest of light to escape from the curtains, leaving no small light to help as a guide through the streets, no sense of the warmth and happiness that might be behind those homes. No one was just cautious anymore, they were more like fanatics. And what was worse, was that that was part of their usual routine now, always being on edge, always being afraid. Being always on edge and afraid made them unable to have time to question, to wonder or think about the environment around them. They feared because it was demanded that they should, and this society always gave in to demands. From the center of town, in the highest building in all of Cheesebridge, there was a peak through curtains, a small sliver of light as eyes looked down to the darkness below. The eyes were small, belonging to a child as they searched through the night. The curtain was pulled back to its proper place after the sound of a reprimanding, yet gentle voice. \"Winnie, please stay by my side if you're going to be in here,\" The voice belonged to Olive, who had certainly grown in the past ten years, her features refined and now better suited to her face. Certainly she had grown into her looks at her current age of twenty six, only made better by the softness in her eyes when she looked down at the child she had been charged to take care of for the past decade. However when it looked to anyone else, those eyes would turn as cold and piercing as ice shards, making her features twist to one of hatred and guarded pain. The child, who had also grown into a young lady, huffed under her breath before sitting by her Nanny, crossing her arms in aggravation. So annoyed was the child that didn't notice how much she acted like the paid carer, her attitude towards others being just as guarded as Olive's, though there was nothing for her to hide. Olive had noticed this herself however, and would take a deep breath of regret, wishing that she could have gone back in time to the point where the attitude was picked up, and instead influenced her with empathy instead of guarded pain and anger. Still, that didn't mean the woman didn't find the child's actions somewhat amusing in an ironic sense. Olive hummed to herself as she quickly braided Winifred's wild red curls into two braids, a usual routine for the child's bedtime that by this point Olive could do it with her eyes shut, which she did. The past decade had given her a lot of time to be able to do things without even thinking about it. The best of it was her sowing, which after all those years of being an apprentice and working hard to block out any wayward thoughts that she didn't want. After all those years of being an apprentice, she was now one of the best in her field, her stitches now perfect in alignment and pattern as she sowed, the action looking more as though her hands glided over the material before she was quickly finished. This was a great profession to have, since it meant more pay in the sense of being a seamstress and repairing the dresses and suits of the lords and ladies of Cheesebridge. In the past ten years she had certainly had quite a bit of money passing through her hands and into her savings, quite different from when she had lived with her family as a teenager, where every coin was made with tears and the hardest work she ever did. But Olive knew that it didn't matter how much money went into her pocket, it would never fill that hole in her heart where home had once been. So, instead she would ignore the hole, sowing whenever she wasn't looking after Miss Portley-Rind, the actions making her thoughts turn blank apart from focusing on the material, needle and thread. It made her feel whole sometimes, but that feeling would always pass. Still, it was better to Olive in her opinion to feel whole for at least a few moments instead of feeling empty all of the time. Winifred stood from her seat and looked over the intricate sowing that her Nanny had been doing, seeing the stitches that seemed unbroken and going for meters down the material. The child suppressed a sigh of boredom and walked back to the curtain covered windows, wanting to take another peak, hoping to find the slightest corners or shadows that could be described at least as maybe Box Trolls. The creatures fascinated the ginger girl, at least the rumors about them did. But she kept her fascination to herself whenever she was around her Nanny, since the briefest mentions of boxes alone seemed to make the woman very sad. Knowing that her Nanny's last name was Trubshaw and that many lords and ladies that were her father's friends often whispered behind Olive's back, Winifred decided that it probably wouldn't be the best idea to ask why. Still, the girl couldn't help it if she wanted to just take a quick peak while her Nanny was too busy to notice. The curtain was pushed back again, just in time for her to see the shadow of one of the creatures, and the small amounts of metal they left behind. Winifred gasped in excitement, which her Nanny noticed and answered back with a silent questioning look as to why she by the window again. The girl grinned innocently and backed away from the window, her mind meanwhile racing with thoughts of Box Trolls coming to get her in the night, and only one way to make sure that 'didn't happen'. \"I must go see father,\" She said aloud, which again was answered back by the Nanny, but this time with an exhausted sigh. \"Please don't bother your father Winnie, he's in a meeting with the other White Hats,\" But by the time Olive was finished talking, Winifred was already out of the room and down the steps that would lead to the meeting room where her father and his associates were discussing 'important business'. And by important business, it was more meant that they were snacking on the best cheeses in the entire town. Olive sighed quietly in aggravation and place down her needle and threads before quickly going after the child, having to pause for a moment though to try and take a breath so she could pursue. Damned tight corsets, the bane of her existence and yet necessary to wear if she wanted to stay in Lord Portley-Rind's good graces. Every time she had to pause for a breath, it only reminded her how she had promised herself as a teenager that she would never wear the ghastly, trouble causing things. But then again, the older Olive that she was today had broken a lot of promises she had made herself, and had instead felt as though she became the very thing she hated. Domesticated. A good pet or trophy for the lord and ladies of court to feel proud over, that they had apparently evolved 'such a boring wall flower into a wonderful rose', or something of that description. They spent years pricking and preening at her in the beginning, scolding her when she didn't curtsey just right or ate with the wrong fork at dinner parties. Every lesson that she learned to please them made her feel less like herself, but all of that wasn't even the worst part about it. No, the worst part of all her training before this point to make her a 'proper' lady, was the whispers behind her back or outright proclamations to her face about their opinions of her father and that terrible night that changed her life. There were mutterings and speeches about how he had been a fool to not lock the door, which was why the baby was taken by Box Trolls in the night and never seen again. Say that he was foolish to pursue them alone, which was why he vanished to. They would talk of him, as if they knew him better than she did herself. And all the while she had to stand there, smile and pretend as though it didn't bother her at all. Domesticated did mean not putting up a fight. They would mumble under their breaths sometimes of how much 'better' she was now that her father couldn't corrupt her mind with his strange ideals, such as her actually having an opinion in matters that concerned her. And when it was all over at night, while Winifred slept dreaming little girl dreams, Olive would stay up and attribute a tear to every horrible word, every mean statement said with the up most of ignorance imaginable. She still cried sometimes, but only when they couldn't see as the darkness of their curfew hid it from sight. Olive shook her head as she descended the stairs, trying to keep her mind on the present as Winifred suddenly appeared at the bottom, her father's White Hat in her hands though it seemed a might smudged by cheese on the very rim. The Nanny gave the child a quick look, and in seeing the defiant yet hurt expression crossing the girl's face she knew immediately that this could not end well. \"Winnie,\" The use of the girl's name was more of a warning not to do whatever it was she was thinking of doing. The girl didn't listen however, a common problem that she had; that Olive sometimes hoped would not be cowed away from the child by the ladies and lords as they had done to her in growing up. Winifred ran quickly up the stairs, the child knowing that because of the tightness of her corset that Olive would not be able to pursue at the same pace. So by the time Olive did manage to scale her way back up the stairs and into the room, it was obvious that it was too late. The window was open, Winifred was glaring out it into the world beyond, and her hands were empty of any White Hat that she had been holding before. It took a few steps to reach the sight of the window, and see the white material of the top hat now off into the centre of the street. \"Winnie, what have you done?\" The woman turned to the ginger child, who now seemed to actually grasp what kind of trouble she was in, and was about to go tearing off out of the room again. But before the girl could start even revving her inner engines, Olive grabbed at her arm to stop her and as quickly as she could possibly manage in a corset, walked quietly down the steps to the front door of the manor, clicking and flicking back all of the locks on the door before eventually managing to get it open. Olive took a deep breath as she began to already feel the cold night air creep through the slightly opened door, trying to shove down a festering ball of worry and fear that for some reason had started to form in the pit of her stomach. Winifred wasn't struggling against her grip any more, and was instead now stuck to her side, looking out into the darkness where the shadows seemed to be constantly moving. \"It's okay,\" Olive assured the child in whispers, pointing out into the dark where thankfully not that far away a White Hat was laying on the ground, \"Your father's hat is just there, we can go get it back, wipe it clean and he'll never have to know this happened,\" They walked out into the darkness together, hand in hand as it seemed what would usually take a few seconds to reach the distance that the hat was, was taking hours. But thankfully they managed to get there uninterrupted. At least they were undisturbed from their task until Olive was leaning over to pick up the precious top hat from the dirty ground, when she was disturbed by Winifred suddenly giving a squeak of fright. Immediately standing to attention, Olive held the girl close to her and looked out into the darkness where Winifred was pointing with a shaking hand. But there didn't seem to be anything there, at least not at the first look. When the woman looked again however, she could see two lights that could best be described as eyes, looking at them. Winifred peeked through her shelter of Olive to see the eyes as well, and called out to it, her voice more fearful than before. \"Who's there?\" Expecting to see a Box Troll step into the street lamp (which was strangely still on despite it now being past curfew,) Olive stood in front of Winifred, her back and shoulders now squared and ready to defend herself and the child, despite the corset that was protesting that action. At least, she would draw attention to herself while the girl ran back to the safety of her home which was not more than twenty steps away. In any case, it was very surprising that instead of the familiar build of a Box Troll stepping into the light, it was a boy. He was as thin as a rake, and for some reason had a box with an egg symbol on it around his midsection and a strange headwear on that had lights attached to it on both sides of his temple, which would explain the strange lights that Olive had thought were eyes peering through the darkness. All at once the woman felt a sense of complete annoyance and embarrassment in her for being so easily fooled, and was about to scold the boy herself on him being outside so late after curfew (despite the obvious fact that she and Winifred were doing the same) and dressing as a Box Troll, when Winifred interrupted her. \"Who are you boy?\" He lifted a part of his headgear so that they could see his face better, but then again it was pretty dark out so Olive couldn't see anything anyway. The answer that he gave back was certainly more than just a little confusing. \"Boy?\" But neither Olive nor Winifred really had time to ask another question as suddenly to Box Trolls appeared on either side of him, grabbing him by the shoulders and shoving him back into the darkness. Olive called out a very helpless 'no' and tried to run after them, but stopped in her tracks when she saw the familiar headlights of the Red Hat automobile, and instead went back to Winifred's side as they watched it chase the boy and two Box Trolls down the street. \"We have to go back inside, pick up the hat and let's go,\" They both turned to do just that, when Olive noticed that the Hat was not on the ground, but now in someone's hands. And thought she only had the help of the manor's open door and nearby street light to let her see who it was, Olive had a feeling that she would known anyway. Mr. Snatcher, who looked not a day older but still somehow so much uglier than when Olive was a teenager, was holding the hat up for inspection, looking it over as if it were the most precious thing in the world. His crooked nose and beady eyes did not look at the woman and child as he first spoke, his rumbling and drawling tones still making Olive's flesh crawl as she pulled Winifred even closer to her than before. \"Someone's out past curfew, very dangerous,\" For whatever reason that Olive didn't want to think about, Winifred piped up from the woman's arms as they protectively held her aways from the creepy man. \"I saw a boy,\" At this comment the man finally looked at the two of them, his expression for a moment showing annoyance that the child had bothered to bring it up, which Olive replied with an intense glare and tighter hold around the girl. Still, the expression on his face then changed to fake confusion and nonchalance as he waved his hand dismissively. \"All I saw was filthy Box Troll monsters,\" He then looked down at them again, as if he were finally seeing who they were for the first time, and his demeanor once again changed to the one that society wanted him to portray to the young woman and little girl as he bowed low, his beady eyes however, never straying from Olive. \"Miss Portley-Rind, Miss Trubshaw, allow me to escort you home.\" Of course Winifred had to be her usual self and struggled out of Olive's over protective hold, turning away from the offer from Mr. Snatcher as she held her nose in the air, much like she knew she was allowed to do. Olive watched her all the while, a little amused that she would talk this way to such a frightening man, but also afraid of what he might do at being rejected. \"I can escort myself thank you,\" While the child's back was turned, Olive could see the look of anger cross his face before he looked back to the hat, and smirked almost evilly. It didn't take long for Winifred to guess that he was not going to give her the hat as he instead walked off towards the manor's front doors, his strides being much wider than the corset wearing Olive's or little girl Winifred's. He seemed to be mocking them as he talked to them both. \"How did this hat find itself, all the way out here?\" He was definitely mocking them with his long drawl and smirk that already told that he knew how it got out here. Still, Winifred being her child-like self tried to come up with an excuse, the best one she could manage apparently being that the wind had somehow blown it out of her grip and down to the street below. Seeing a chance to mess with them more, Mr. Snatcher checked the wind flow by licking his finger and lifting it into the air as they walked up the steps. \"Must have died down, suddenly,\" He hisses the last word and once again Olive clutches the child to her as if he were going to snatch her away any second. He continued walking on and they tried to follow after him, Olive for the first time speaking in this whole situation to the Box Troll exterminator. \"There really is no need for you to come inside,\" Her tone was hardened, and she was hoping that he would just take the hint, give Winifred the hat and leave them both alone. But of course that was not what truly happened, as instead he only seemed more pleased that she had spoken to him, and grinned even wider so they could see his yellowing horrible teeth. \"Oh but as a gentleman Miss Trubshaw, I insist.\" He turned back around before Olive could think of a decent retort, opened the door and stepped into the manor's front foyer, his voice now echoing off the walls of the manor as he called out for Lord Portley-Rind. There was a rustle of noise behind the meeting room door before eventually his Lordship made an appearance, stepping out of the room to look down on who it was that had interrupted his 'important business'. \"What is going on?\" At seeing Mr. Snatcher at the very beginning of the star case, Lord Portley-Rind seemed to get his answer. Olive, remembering her place no matter how much she would like to forget it as the others of the White Hat walked out of the meeting room to see what all the commotion was, curtsied low, her eyes however remaining on Winifred just in case. \"Apologies your lordship, I found something out on the street that belongs to you,\" Mr. Snatcher held out the White hat where it could be seen, and Lord Portley –Rind immediately went to fetch it back, only to be annoyed when it was obvious that the red clad man was not going to let go of it. There was some usual banter that went on between Mr. Snatcher and his Lordship on how exactly one receives a White Hat and all the responsibilities, plus benefits that were leased from it. All the possibilities of getting a White Hat seemingly galaxies away from what Mr. Snatcher were able to do, and what he was. At least that was until Mr. Snatcher started mentioning something that Olive had never heard about before. \"Fortunately, we still have our little agreement don't we your Lordship? When I destroy every last Box Troll in this town, I shall earn my White Hat and join you in the tasting room,\" Mr. Snatcher had scaled the steps while talking of this agreement that was very new to Olive's attention, the red clad man looking into the room that just behind the other White hated men, where all different aromas of cheese was floating out. This action was very much cut short by the door being slammed shut by the three White hated men, Lord Portley-Rind smirking to himself as he joined his fellow members at the top of the stairs, twirling his mustache with his finger as he usually did whenever he was being facetious to someone. \"Good Lord, not sure who should be more terrified, the Box Trolls or us!\" The White hated men laughed with him for a moment as was socially meant, and then finally it seemed that the conversation went back to how the hat had managed to get outside in the first place. Mr. Snatcher grinned once again and turned back to Winifred and the still painfully curtsying Olive, his now amused once more as he looked down at them both. His Lordship however, was not as amused. \"I was told; the wind had something to do with it,\" Lord Portley-Rind looked down at the older woman and his daughter, a brief look of annoyance crossing his features as Winifred looked back to with the biggest apologetic eyes the small girl could muster on cue. When that didn't seem to work, she went for apologizing aloud instead. \"The wind eh?\" \"Father I'm so-\" She was interrupted however, by Mr. Snatcher once more as he bid everyone farewell, Olive once again feeling his eyes staring at her form as she continued to curtsy. \"-Sorry can't stay, too much work to do. Miss Portley-Rind, Your Lordship, Sirs, Miss Trubshaw, I bid you all goodnight. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again very, very soon.\" There was a moment of silence after he had back out of the front foyer and outside once more, the front door clicking shut almost silently (a far departure from what Olive remembered of his visits in her old home). However that was broken almost immediately when the Box Troll exterminator opened the door again, gave his head measurements for a hat, then finally left. Olive had never been so glad to see someone finally just leave. There was some more awkward silence as Winifred attempted to talk to her father about what she had done, tried to say that this was a perfect opportunity to talk about their problems as father and daughter. And when that didn't seem to work she tried to tell him of the boy that she and Olive had seen with the Box Trolls, but of course that was cut off by his Lordship and his White hated associates walking back into the tasting room and shutting the door behind them. Olive got to finally stand up from her painful curtsying position and patted Winifred gently on the back. The older woman tried to comfort the child with words on how he would understand someday, but even Olive knew that it was falling deaf ears, so eventually she gave up and led Winifred back upstairs to her room where she was finally tucked into bed and read a story that for once didn't have monsters in it. It was only after Olive was sure that Winifred had brushed her teeth and was tucked in tight that she actually mentioned something to the child. \"Winifred, about the man that interrupted you father's meeting tonight,\" Olive looked back to the child, who was thankfully paying complete attention to her while she was talking, \"He is not a good person to be around on your own, no matter what someone might try and tell you otherwise. If you ever find yourself alone with him at all, you call for me and I'll help you, okay?\" Winifred nodded in agreement, the woman could tell that she was taking it seriously due to the expression on her face, and after a nod of her own she bid the little girl goodnight and when to bed herself. It was only as Olive had just laid her head down on the pillow and looked up at the ceiling of her room, where she had stuck pictures of planets and stars while his lordship and ladyship weren't looking nor criticizing her room, that Olive realized something she didn't know how she could have possibly forgotten. Tomorrow was the tenth anniversary of the 'Trubshaw baby' incident. Ten years since her family had been taken from her. Then, like every anniversary before now, Olive found that she couldn't sleep. Olive hated the Trubshaw baby remembrance days more than anything else in the world. The woman didn't even know she could feel so much hate before the idea for the remembrance was first suggested. Her reasoning for hating this yearly exercise weren't just because it was a horribly tragic and personal moment in her life that didn't seem like something she would ever be getting over completely in the near future. It was more because they treated it like a festival. Balloons, party games, even dress ups to repeat the horrid affair until it became nothing more than a money making opportunity to these people. It made her sick; it angered her so completely that she no longer had the words to describe her upset at such a horrid twisting of that day. The worst part in it all however was not just that she had to go because Winifred always wanted to see it, but also because of the yearly reenacting and song singing of the occasion by the well known and apparently well liked (though Olive hated them with such a fiery passion, probably more than she did the festival itself) Madame Frou Frou. Every year this strange woman that wasn't even from this town would tell the 'story', because that was all it was to her, a 'story' and not the worst moment in her life. And every year the story would be told completely wrong in Olive's opinion, (not that anyone ever cared to hear her opinion anyway). It was even in the slightest suggestion that her father hadn't taken his son's safety in account one night and because of it, he and the baby were eaten by Box Trolls that angered her to no end. But still, Olive could never really decide what was worse about the song that Madame Frou Frou insisted on performing every year. If it was because the horribly descriptive explanations of her families end at the hands of Box Trolls, or the fact that they actually bothered to include her in the 'story' as well. Daughter Trubshaw was so sad When she heard the fate of her brother and dad So the little girl let out a mournful cry so loud It broke every window in the town Every damned year, every time that verse would come up in Frou Frou's song she would feel eyes searching, waiting for her to feel embarrassed or sometimes even smile at being mentioned. But she wouldn't gave them the satisfaction of a reaction and instead glared holes into Frou Frou's skull. How could they even expect her to manage a smile at a song that was made about the horrid deaths of her family at the hands of what her father mistakenly thought were gentle creatures? How could she ever smile again when such horrible jokes were made at the expense of the dead? Finally, just as every other year, the song ended and the crowd dispersed, Olive made her way to the back of the stage where Winifred would be waiting for her, talking admittedly about the show and how great she was in the main role of the Trubshaw baby, not seeing the pain that etched its way across the usually blank expression that her nanny would wear. In the meantime, whenever someone attempted to sell something with this festival's hands on it to either her or the little girl, Olive would shut them up very quickly with such a withering glare that made them feel as small as they should. However, this year as Olive went to the back stage to retrieve Winifred once again, she was surprised to find that the child was not there waiting for her. Not wanting to look as fearful as she was inside, Olive started walking the path they usually did every other year in the hopes that maybe Winifred was just a few steps further ahead than her, because she had for some reason taken off without waiting for her first. For a time to Olive however, it seemed as though Winifred was nowhere in sight. It took less than five seconds for Olive to feel as though she was going to have a heart attack. Just the thought of going back to Lord Portley-Rind and telling him that she didn't know where his daughter was, would most certainly have her discharged from his service. Olive knew she hanging on a thin thread as it was, what with the incident that happened last night, since it was pretty obvious that his Lordship was not happy with either her or Winifred. And already Olive could see what would lie in store for her if she managed to get herself discharged from the Portley-Rind household. She would be homeless, soon penniless, and then she would be helpless to refuse any generous hands of help, at least that was how the society of Cheesebridge said it had to be. She would be helpless to refuse marriage of any kind, since she would only be further seen as ungrateful, and cast out altogether. It would be when she was helpless that Mr. Snatcher would make his move, Olive knew that he was just waiting for the chance that she would be fired from her current place, she knew this since whenever he was around, she could just feel his eyes watching her, waiting for the screw up that would have her unable to get away from his 'generous proposal'. Olive was walking faster now, fear edging its way onto her face as she was starting to become frantic to find even a glimpse of ginger hair. She was looking everywhere, searching every place imaginable, when suddenly she got that glimpse she had been praying for. And that glimpse was Winifred, running down Milk Street to the turning point where it became Curd's Way. Immediately Olive started to give chase, happy in the secret fact that she had decided to not where a corset that day, but that didn't mean she was able to keep up with the sprightly child. When reaching the end of Curd's Way and accepting that she would need to ask for help, Olive stopped in her tracks as she saw the Red Hat factory overhead, thinking to herself on how unfair it was that just think about how you want to avoid someone, and then end up running into them. Olive started to walk past the factory, not wanting to ask anyone there for help as she figured that she'd run into Winifred at some point. However it was just as she was taking another step that she saw Winifred again, with a boy. At first she wanted to immediately step in, until she realized that it was the boy from last night. With her interests peaked, Olive took a step back to hide behind some fence posts to watch what was happening. For some reason the boy and Winifred started running, and it was only until Olive looked up that she saw what she was quite sure was Mr. Gristle from the Red Hats falling practically out of the sky and attempting to grab them both as he fell towards them. For a moment Olive just watched this go on, mouth open a little in surprise and confusion. The strange boy and Winifred thankfully got away just in time by opening a man-hole cover and jumping down to the sewers below. Mr. Gristle however landed a few second to late as his face became acquainted with that same man-hole cover, the sight of it having Olive bit her bottom lip in sympathy pain. Not two seconds after this had occurred, the other Red Hats, including Mr. Snatcher went outside, talked for a bit, and then went back into the factory with the clearly unconscious Mr. Gristle. This smelled of suspicion to Olive, and she quickly thought herself up a plan on what to do next. Olive was thankful that she had at least some idea of where Winifred was now, so the woman was sure that she could go after her later and bring her home on time for Lord Portley-Rind's party. What had happened in the Red Hat Factory to make her and this strange boy run away was what Olive was the most curious about the most at that moment; at least enough that she had made the decision to check out the factory first and find Winifred next. So, with her plan in mind, Olive walked slowly to the factory's main door, unsurprised to find it open as she walked inside. Please review, constructive criticism always welcome.[Chapter 3] Olive was surprised to find the main room of the factory to be empty of any Red Hats at that moment. Not that the woman wasn't happy to see that, since it meant she got to have a better look about the place without being interrupted for a few moments. Her footsteps do their best to be light, so as to not draw attention to herself to soon. And that seems to work, at least until she walks to the centre of the room, then and only then does the floorboards creek. Taking a quick step back, Olive looks down at the floorboards that seem so different from the others around the factory. For a moment the woman figures that it is just her imagination that they seem different, until she steps on them again and feels that creek. After a few moments of looking around and stepping on other floorboards, Olive began to hazard a guess that there was something more than just dirt underneath the floorboards in the centre of the room. To make extra sure however, Olive makes a quick test. In the secret pockets that she had sown into her dresses, the twenty six year old often kept extra needles and thread in there, just in case. She takes out one of the needles, and carefully drops it down the space in between the floorboards. For a few seconds nothing happens, and Olive wonders if her intuition was wrong. However that flies out the window when the needle suddenly jumped back out from the space in the floorboards, landing nearby. Olive stared over at the needle, feeling scared now that her intuition was not only right, but was even more correct than she really wanted it to be. She looked back down through the floorboards, her voice whispering as quietly as she could manage but still loud enough that someone could hear her from down there. \"Is someone there?\" For a second there wasn't a reply, and then she suddenly hears a voice whisper in a sort of echo, what was quite possibly the weirdest thing to say in the whole situation. \"…Jelly…\" Well, that was certainly not expected. Olive sits up, her expression contorted into confusion as to what she had heard, but at least it was a confirmation that there was someone down there. After a moment she got back up on her feet, and started to wonder if there was a crowbar or something somewhere that she could use to open up the floorboards and help whoever it was that was stuck under there. However when she turned around to start looking, she ran nearly completely into someone's midsection. \"Miss Trubshaw, what a pleasant surprise,\" Mr. Snatcher looked down at her from his height, a grin spreading uneasily across his face as she steps back enough so as to not smell the strange scent that was coming off of him. If Olive wasn't on her guard before she definitely was now, her hand gently sneaking to secret pocket she had on the back of her dress. Mr. Snatcher didn't seem to notice though, since he seemed to busy talking. \"Have you been enjoying the Trubshaw baby remembrance?\" Whether he was goading her again or not, Olive didn't care anymore. What she did know however, was that she now had the chance to finally let out some frustration the twenty six years old always felt every once a year. Especially since he was the one that brought it up first and not her. \"Usually I hate it when people create a festival and parlor tricks out of the worst day in my life so to answer your question, no I did not enjoy one part of it,\" Her voice is not restrained like it ever would be in the presence of Lord Portley-Rind and his associates, but for the first time in ten years is defiant and angry. Mr. Snatcher did not seem as though he had calculated this reaction, though quickly covered his surprise with a fake happy expression. \"Really, well that is a shame to hear Miss Trubshaw, truly it is.\" He tried to move around her so he was behind her, but Olive knew better than to turn her back on him, so instead circled around as he did so they were always face to face, right where she could watch his every move. Her hand stayed in the secret back pocket of her skirts, ready at any moment should she need to defend herself or make a quick getaway from his presence. Deciding that this conversation was leading nowhere, Olive changed her tact a bit and became a mite more confrontational, squaring her shoulders as she always did when she was ready for a fight, her breath slowing a bit so her heart beat did go to wild in her chest. Mr. Snatcher seemed to notice her change in stance as well, and was now watching her more carefully, though trying not to show that he was on to her. \"What's under these floorboards?\" She tried to not let on completely that she knew there was someone under there, since she was worried exactly what would happen to her if she told him. From the corner of her eye Olive could see some more of the Red Hats descending down the steps nearby, which meant that she was now definitely out numbered and should be even more on her guard than before. Mr. Snatcher meanwhile, had been obviously thinking quickly on an explanation to fall back on, and eventually found one. \"Oh, just some machinery we have to help us rid the scourge of the Box Trolls,\" Of course he was lying, since Olive was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to explain to her why someone was obviously being held under the floorboards, and make it sound actually logical and not at all illegal. Olive nodded carefully in reply, taking another careful and hopefully unnoticeable step back from the Box Troll exterminator and closer to the door out of there. However before she could start mentioning that she wanted to leave, Mr. Snatcher start to go off on another whole conversation that the woman was sure she didn't want to be a part of nor ever suggested that she might be. \"In fact, we are not that far away from wiping out every last one of the Box Trolls that were the cause of your family tragedy, your grievances will be avenged my dear,\" Olive tried to look pleased at that news, just as she always did whenever someone would tell her that Box Trolls would pay for her loss. But as always, it only made her feel hollow inside. Most of the time she liked to think that she didn't know why, but sometimes she allowed herself to accept what everyone had told her was wrong. That the Box Trolls weren't responsible for her family's death. Olive had tried, for all her attempts to not be completely abandoned by the society of Cheesebridge, to believe what everyone else did about the Box Trolls, that they were monsters that ate children and parents, and that they needed to be destroyed. But for whatever reason, no matter how many times she heard, how many times she saw the graves of her father and baby brother she visited every Sunday, she just couldn't accept it. She had seen how the Box Trolls behaved when they were in her home before this tragedy happened, and couldn't still for the life of her accept that they were capable of what they were accused. It confused her so badly, but at the same time she couldn't think of any other reason how this happened, at least not any that could be proven with evidence. Not that anyone would listen to her, so instead she just swallowed her instincts back and listened as Mr. Snatcher seemed to be drawling on still, what he was saying seeming to go further and further into a completely delusional area. \"And when the filthy Box Trolls are gone, as I am sure you are well aware, I will become a part of the league of White Hats, a gentleman above all others,\" At first she didn't really get what he was trying to say, since in the beginning it seemed to Olive that he was just repeating himself on facts she already knew. But then, just as he was finished mentioning the fact that he might become a part of the White Hats, just as the silence after he had spoken was about to become noticeable, he did something that definitely caught her off guard. Mr. Snatcher had grabbed her hand, thankfully not the one that was behind her back that was just touching the secret pocket filled with pins, and dropped to one knee. For a moment Olive just looked back at him, eyes wide in complete disbelief that he would be so forward about such things. Sure she certainly had known of his motives, Olive had known about them from when she was a teenager and had spent the past decade, at least when she was not grieving for the loss of her family, trying to stay away from those motives of the Box Troll exterminator at every opportunity. The other Red Hats that had appeared from the stairs above were now throwing some kind of confetti, though Olive was half sure that it was actually rice. Meanwhile Mr. Snatcher had started going off on a tangent of his own that seemed a little too well rehearsed for her liking. The first line of which was already enough to stun her into silence as her eyes darted around for an exit route out of this almost confrontational proposition her was giving her. \"And every great gentleman needs a woman by his side, to stand by him in every decision and obey his will-\" It struck Olive not to long into his speech that this was actually happening, and it wasn't just some horrid nightmare her mind was sadistically giving her. The woman was starting to wonder if she should just throw the pins in her secret pocket in his face now and start running, but for whatever reason, be it that she wanted to have the last word or if for some reason she was actually expecting Mr. Snatcher to really tell her who or what was under the floorboards, Olive stayed put and got herself that last word. \"Will you do me the honor of being my wife?\" For a second Olive was being certain on just throwing the pins now and running, since it would definitely give him the answer she absolutely had to that question. But then again, she would be left with no real answers as to who was under those floorboards or why the strange boy and Winifred had run and been perused by them just a few moments ago. So instead of violently attacking Mr. Snatcher, she instead pulled her hand out of his grip and answered back as emotionlessly as possible. \"Absolutely not,\" Well she had tried to be emotionless, but it was hard to do that with the memories she had of him threatening her father, threatening her family. The other Red Hats that had been throwing the rice confetti stopped in their actions, now looking uneasily at their boss for what his reaction would be. However Mr. Snatcher's reaction was not one of sadness, embarrassment or even complete anger, instead he seemed more annoyed that she was fighting back against him. Olive didn't give him a chance to speak as he got back on both his legs, her hand pointing directly down to the floorboards nearby. \"I asked what was under those floorboards, and I know you lied so tell me the truth. What is down there?\" She took steps back when she saw Mr. Snatcher's expression starting to darken more, one of the other Red Hats, Mr. Gristle (whom seemed to have shaken off his head injury pretty fast), chuckling under his breath. The boss of the Box Troll exterminators was almost snarling now as he answered back to her question. \"Nothing that you need to bother your mind about,\" Well, that seemed to be the best that she could wrangle out of him for, since at least she knew for certain that he had lied before and trusted her hearing enough to know that there was someone down there. And now it seemed that he had finally managed to reach anger, a point that Olive knew was the best to get away from. Looking quickly to the other Red Hats, the woman got the feeling that since they were a good way up the stairs, that she would at least get a few more seconds to get away than if they were on the ground level with her and Mr. Snatcher. \"Very well, continue to cover it up if you want, but I know there's someone down there, I heard them. And I will be back for them,\" There was a flash of worry at being found out, before Mr. Snatcher's anger returned in full force. Now that he knew that Olive knew there was someone under the floor of this factory, the woman decided now was probably the best time to make her exit. Manuvering herself so she was now her back was facing the door and Mr. Snatcher was in front of her, she got ready to run. \"Oh I very much doubt that devil woman! I've stepped over Trubshaws to get what I want in the past, I am not above doing so again!\" Olive didn't give herself a moment to wonder what he meant by that, as instead she noticed that the other Red Hats were beginning to slowly descend the stairs. So instead of questioning further, she got herself that last word. \"Not today,\" Her hand moved quick, taking a handful of pins and throwing them directly in his face. Olive didn't bother looking to make sure she had even injured him, instead letting her feet carry her as fast as possible out of the factory and down the street beyond. The woman didn't look behind her once as she ran, her hearing already notifying her of the footsteps that were in fast pursuit of her every move. Thankfully the woman had managed that day, as she always did whenever she knew that Lord Portley-Rind and his ever watching wife weren't noticing, to where trousers underneath her skirts. That, combined with the fact that she wasn't wearing a corset that day either, managed to grant her more athleticism than she would have with that damned air cutting piece of 'fashion'. Olive knew she was in control of where the chase would go, and so to make it even slightly harder for them to catch her, and to make sure that none of the Lord and Ladies that judged her safe future as a part of their level in life, saw this exercise, Olive directed the chase into the back streets and alleys of Cheesebridge. Of course the Red Hats knew the streets of Cheesebridge than anyone, they had been given a decade to know them like the back of their hands while hunting down those Box Trolls, so Olive wasn't completely sure how well this was going to go for her. Which was why as she turned another corner to run down another alleyway, the twenty six year old had started thinking about a place to hide from them while getting her thoughts together on what to do next. Immediately her mind jumped to the one place she was pretty sure the Red Hats would not follow after her for the life of them, that and she knew that was where Winifred and the strange boy she had run off with, where safe and waiting. So, with this new location in mind, Olive took quick turns and twists down the dark streets, though it was still day light, and made her way towards the closest sewer opening. A man hole was probably out of the question for entrance into the sewers, the few moments it would take to open it and crouch down to climb down the ladder would have her caught for sure, but that didn't necessarily mean that she was out of options. For instance, the alley way that Olive now had in mind as a destination did have a rather large, gated pipe opening that lead down into the tunnels under ground. She didn't have a lot of time left, the footsteps behind her never ceasing in growing closer despite her every turn and past attempt to lose them. The pipe was really the only chance she had left to get out of this situation and still have the ability to find Winifred and help that person underneath the floorboards of the Box Troll extermination factory. If she allowed herself to get caught, Olive had a feeling that she wouldn't be going anywhere, ever again. This thought alone, got her to run just that smallest bit faster towards her new location, trying always to make sure that the Red Hats were behind her, never suddenly in front of her where they could easily have her trapped. So far that had only managed to happen a few times when she wasn't completely focusing on what was in front of her, where thankfully Olive had found a way out at the last second, just scraping past their grabbing hands that wanted to stop her from getting away. Every nerve end in her was screaming to stop, which made sense since Olive was pretty sure she had done at least three laps of the alley ways and darkened streets of Cheesebridge, and her legs were just begging for a rest. But she couldn't stop just yet, not when there was still a chance for her to get to that pipe opening, which by this point was just ahead of her. With one last burst of her energy that the woman could manage after twenty six years of not really having to run as fast as she did this day, Olive managed to make it to the gated pipe. It took her a few precious seconds, in which the Red Hats were still running down the other street but were definitely not that far off, for Olive to notice that the gate had a padlock on it. With fast shaking hands, a pin was again pulled out of her secret pocket of her skirt, fiddling in the key hole for a few seconds as she prayed her limited intelligence in lock breaking wouldn't ruin her chances of getting away. Apparently whatever world creating deity that existed was smiling down on Olive that day, either that or the padlock was so old that it was really that inefficient, since the padlock almost immediately unlocked and fell into her hand. One look back down the street was enough to tell Olive that the Red Hats were close to grabbing her. So, with one quick fluid motion that the woman wasn't completely aware she had the capability to do, she slipped through the gate opening, shutting it behind her and locking the padlock back into place. Mr. Gristle, the smallest and apparently most animalistic of the Red Hats, was the first to reach the gate of the pipe that stood between him and capturing Olive, grunting furiously as he started to attempt to apparently yank the gate of its hinges. Olive took a step back as she watched him, wondering how long it had been since the man had apparently lost his mind, her hands touching to the cylindrical wall around her for support as she tried to slow her adrenaline filled and frightened heartbeat. The other two Red Hats that seemed of a sounder mind, that being Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickle, were right behind him and looked somewhat conflicted. Olive knew the look of confliction when she saw it, she wore it herself quite a lot for the past decade, but what it was they were unsure about she wasn't completely sure, but the woman decided to take a chance that they were conflicted in chasing her as she attempted to plead to them. All the while trying to ignore the rather loud attempts of Mr. Gristle to rip the gate covering off the pipe she was hiding it for that moment. \"Just let me go, let me…\" Olive felt her lungs burning with the need for her to stop talking there and let some of that precious breath oxygen in, no matter if it did somewhat smell since she was currently standing in an opening to the sewers. This lack of breath was a slight problem to her, since it didn't really give her a chance to give evidence as to why they should let her out of their grasp and face the wrath of their boss. Still, it seemed to be something of an incentive to have the two at least slightly reasonable Red Hats to have a discussion. \"Chasing a young lady through the streets… doesn't really sound like a very good guy sort of thing… does it Mr. Trout?\" The tallest of the Red Hats, who also had somewhat slight mouse like features with his noticeable front buck teeth, said as he turned to the almost intentional opposite in appearance partner in Red Hat ownership, who looked just as lost for an answer that would justify what Mr. Pickle had said. However, Olive did not let herself stay around another second longer to find out what their final opinion of their actions was as Mr. Gristle's violent attempts to rip the gate apart had started to elicit sounds of creaking of metal giving in to his strength. Fearfully she turned and ran further down the pipe, having to duck her head eventually as the pipe grew very slowly yet surely, smaller. Olive didn't stop her fleeing through the pipe until she was sure that she couldn't see even the smallest indication of the light from the pipe opening anymore, but still she only slowed it to a very fast walking pace. Still, that probably wasn't the best of choices since because the light from the pipe opening was gone; she was stumbling through the darkness with no idea as to where it was leading, though really the final destination could only be better than being caught by those Red Hats, especially Mr. Gristle. Thankfully, the pipe didn't become too small that she couldn't fit through it when she reached the other side of the pipe. When slowly climbing out of the pipe and to what was on the other side, Olive noted that wherever this part of the sewers was, while it did smell bad, it certainly didn't smell as awful enough to be the part that she suspected. So Olive guessed that where she was now, was either a long forgotten portion of the underground in Cheesebridge, or had something to do with rainwater. Where the pipe opened up on the other side was darker than before, and was certainly too big to be another pipe, Olive knowing this since she could hear her footsteps and breath echoing even more than it did before in the pipe. There was a possibility that it was the size of an average room, though there was no real way to tell besides stumbling around and feeling the walls. Olive still wasn't completely sure where she was supposed to go next, not that she could see it even if she did know, so she just continued walking. All around her was almost dead silent, apart from the periodic sounds of water dripping and her own footsteps. It was calming in the fact that she could no longer hear other footsteps behind her, chasing her down with the want to drag her back to that factory, most likely to join that person under the floorboards, which was definitely not something that she wanted to do. What she wanted to do, was find Winifred and that strange boy, however it was only as Olive had entered the underground herself, that she wasn't sure exactly how she was going to find them now. Certainly this place was a lot darker and possibly bigger than the twenty six year old had given it credit before, and was feeling very foolish in that she didn't decide to follow after the children first before going into that factory, and had assumed that she would easily discover the two children in this rather huge place. But still what the woman had discovered in that factory was well worth the trip, since now there was someone in there being kept possibly against their will, and needed her help, since it seemed that no one else seemingly could or possibly would even if they knew. If it was anything that the twenty six year old hated more, it was the thought that she could ever have the possibility of doing the right thing, and not doing it. Now that Olive knew there was someone down there, she had to do something about it since the woman knew that otherwise she wouldn't let herself sleep at night. The guilt would keep her awake, as so it should since it was her morals and her way of living that Olive really held up to a high standard. Olive's thought process was broken with her eyes catching a glint of light nearby, she walked towards it carefully, not sure what to make of it just yet since it didn't look a lot like sunlight from the way it looked and the fact that Olive felt heat the closer she walked. So there was the possibility that it was a fire light, which seemed possible due to the evidence of the sense of heat and the color of the lighting. Fire lighting could mean permanent living, so as far as the woman knew that she could be either slowly walking towards the Box Trolls 'lair', or where Winifred and the boy where currently staying and possibly waiting for her. Still, Olive knew she couldn't walk away from it because there was a chance that it was one thing instead of the other, so she instead continued to walk towards the fire sourced light; hoping all the while that it wasn't the worst of the possibilities. As Olive took another step closer towards the light, she felt the ground for some reason go smooth underfoot, and she slipped forwards with a frightened cry that echoed through the underground and back to her. Because the ground was apparently now made of smooth metal, and so because of that Olive was now slipping down the almost slide like ground towards the light she had been trying beforehand to slowly go towards it. Now, she was sliding towards it faster than she would have liked, and had no way of stopping it. Olive had let out only one frightened cry with slipping forwards, but was now silent as she was gritting her teeth together to harshly to bother making a noise. The slide that was once the ground continued on, eventually twisting into a funnel, the hole down the bottom leading to who knows where, and Olive certainly didn't want to know, as she tried to stop her fast descent down this funnel like ground, wandering what had happened to the usual physics of the world that would not allow for the ground to become like this. But of course her efforts to stop or at least slow down in her descent failed as she of course fell through that strange funnel like hole and to the world below, her gritting teeth loosening to a frightened cry as she fell, not knowing how this was fall was going to end, if she was going to be seriously hurt, or worse. The fall of course had to eventually end as she landed, but where she landed was not where or how she had ever expected. For instance, her fall was cushioned rather well, in that it didn't end with her legs broken or something. Olive had squeezed her eyes shut when she had fallen, and took a few seconds after she had stopped before she finally allowed herself to open her eyes to see if she was alright, which thankfully she was, though what she saw that had cushioned her fall so well, confused her for a few seconds before the dots connected in her mind. Boxes, she had landed on a rather large pile of boxes. At first she tried to deny that it couldn't possibly be what she thought it was, but that failed quickly when Olive saw glowing yellow eyes peering out from the holes in the cardboard. Olive jumped up to her feet the moment she saw it, as if they were a fire that burned her hands, a cry of surprise rather than fear, backing away fast as the Box Trolls tipped their boxes back upright, their heads slowly poking out of the top as they watched her. For a moment nothing happened, Olive just looking back at the Box Trolls and them looking at her. Nothing happened, as certainly there wasn't any life threatening actions against her, which Olive found she wasn't all that surprised by, which did make sense, since Olive remembered them from her time as a teenager. That time that Olive had at one point tried to deny for the sake of accepting her families death, but eventually accepted that it wasn't false, that the Box Trolls weren't as dangerous as everyone had said before. \"Miss Olive!\" The moment was broken by the happy yell of Winifred as the little girl suddenly ran out from seemingly nowhere and attached herself to her nanny's side. Olive naturally hugged the small girl back, of course immediately confused as to why she was here, with these Box Trolls in their 'lair', especially when she had seen her only with the strange boy. The same strange boy that the woman noticed immediately was standing not that far away. Her arms wrapped around Winifred that much tighter subconsciously, not sure how to act in this situation so she fell back on being protective of the only child she had left under her care, that she had responsibility for. Olive didn't want anything to happen to Winifred while she was there, didn't want to think that she was helpless to do something or protect this child while standing right there and looking at the danger in the eye. She had been helpless to protect a child in the past; she didn't want that to ever happen again. \"Winnie, why are you with Box Trolls and a strange boy?\" Her question was hushed, hopefully to the point where only the little girl could hear her instead of any of them standing in front of her. The ginger girl broke from the protective hug and rubbed at the back of her neck, taking steps back to the Box Trolls and the boy. Olive knew Winifred was getting ready to explain herself, knowing the physical attitude of this child since the twenty six year old practically raised her, but still Olive felt the prick of fear in her that Winifred was walking closer to what she wasn't completely sure was a safe situation, despite of her morals and past experience telling her that the child would be fine. \"Well…\" There was a quick explanation to what happened to her and this boy in the factory, which for one second did not sound the slightest bit safe and only made her want to go back there to wrap her hands around that Mr. Snatcher's throat. However, after a few moments when the explanation was over, the woman noted the expression on Winifred's face, knowing the little girl enough that she was holding something back that needed to come to the woman's attention. \"Winifred Portley-Rind, what aren't you telling me that I need to know?\" Olive didn't like to take on the appearance of the disapproving and disappointed adult, having had enough of that in her life herself, even now and she was twenty six. This just didn't seem like the ginger haired girl that Olive had seen throughout her ten years of life, since if Winifred was talking about something, she would spare no details. In fact, sometimes she would go into a little too much detail for the woman's liking. So what wasn't she saying? \"This is Eggs,\" Winifred gestured to the strange boy, who looked very awkward and for some reason and ignored the gesture for him to move forward as he seemed a little… scared somewhat of Olive. She was a little confused by his mannerisms, mostly because her memory, experiences, and the fact that he standing right near them, that told her that he was acting a lot like a Box Troll. Why this was, she was pretty sure that it was because he was dressed like one of them and seemed much more comfortable standing by them than by her and Winifred. \"Well he's… the Red Hat's said he…\" Winifred trailed off as Eggs seemed to gain some nerve, stepping forward a little bit before he spoke up, though his voice was a little softer than it would be otherwise. \"I'm the Trubshaw baby,\" Olive was usually filled with words, so many things she always wanted to say, or had said or will say. But in this moment, she was completely silent, any thought of any words that could fill this void dropping down into her stomach and causing it to ache so terribly with a hollow pain. \"He's your brother,\" Please review, constructive criticism always welcome.[Chapter 4] Hi guys, I'd just like to thank you all for your reviews, it's really helped to keep this story alive for me and try my best to keep up with my updating pace on this story. So anyway, here's yet another chapter, so enjoy! \"How dare you,\" Those were the first words that Olive could manage, her voice box now seemingly malfunctioning after hearing what the two children had said to her. Olive's heart meanwhile was both beating faster than a horse's speed limit in anger, yet was frozen in place with sudden fear and confusion. She just couldn't believe what she had heard, so instead Olive immediately rejected every word of it, all her anger from the past decade bursting to the surface with her words before she could really hold it back and control it. Eggs seemed frightened; certainly the Box Trolls were now hiding in their boxes from her stare. Winifred looked only confused mostly, though there was a small might of fear in her since she had never really seen her nanny this emotional about something other than her safety. The last time she had been that upset, Winifred had run off for a few moments out of Olive's sight. What the child got in reply was an hour's worth of nagging to never do that again. But of course Winifred would do it again; she did it all the time. \"Do you think this is a joke Winifred, because this is so, so hurtful. More than I think you could ever understand,\" Olive's emotions often ran away from her whenever she allowed herself to feel, so the anger that she had soon evolved back into sadness and before she knew it she was close to tears. Though she would not let those tears fall to where it could be seen, where she could be seen as weak. That was the last thing she needed at that moment, since Olive was pretty sure she had enough on her plate as it was. \"But Miss Olive, he-\" \"That's enough Winifred!\" Olive hadn't meant to shout, but all the same felt the woman felt as though she was somehow being attacked. But in reality the only thing that was attacking her was her own mind, one half wanting to reach out and believe, the other half, that over time had become distrustful and angry to the world she had been left in for the past decade, pushed away immediately at every thought that this could be true. Olive was far too bitter from ten years of loneliness to accept this possibility, so she immediately denied it. The red haired child looked hurt at being so suddenly snapped at, and Olive did feel regret at having done so, but at the same time the woman was angry at the thought of the most tragic moment in her life was once again being apparently made a joke of. This was probably why Olive was not quite done talking herself, letting out maybe a few too many things that maybe Olive had been keeping cooped in her pained heart. \"Isn't it enough… that everyone else up there in that town, has to be so cruel? Cruel enough, that they make a festival day out of the worst moment in my life, you have to do this to?\" There was a sense of resentment that Olive had towards Winifred sometimes that the child would find so much enjoyment in Box Trolls and the festival, the child's avidness for such celebrations being the only reason that Olive was always forced to go. And that was something that always hurt Olive, but all the same the woman kept that to herself, not wanting Lord Portley-Rind or another of the higher ups in Cheesebridge to bother her with how she should not show her upset. No, she could never be upset, because that was not 'proper' to a woman of Cheesebridge. Olive was only ever told to smile and bear through it, and because she wanted to not be left alone with nothing to depend on to keep her from the dangers of this town that hid during the day time; she would do as they said. Like the good domesticated pet she was forced to be around them, every action done according to them melting away what was the person she had been before. But down here, Olive was not around the Lords and Ladies of Cheesebridge, She was not obligated to just bear it and pretend that everything was fine when she was falling apart, so the woman didn't bother. It felt liberating, freeing somehow to say what she wanted to say so badly. And really Olive knew that this release of feelings wasn't Winifred's fault at all, neither was it Eggs fault or even the Box Trolls fault, but unfortunately that were here and had to sit through this as she let out all these emotions like a well needed breath of fresh air. \"My brother is dead Winnie; he died just as my father did. I was given the remains to bury, and there are now tombstones with their names on them. They're dead.\" Tears couldn't be held back anymore, freeing themselves from the trap of her eyelids as the memory of being presented her father and infant brother's remains at seventeen, having to be the one to identify that it was them. Before that point she had liked to think that she was a grown up, but that she was still so young. That day, she realized that she was too young to see this part of the world. Olive still felt that she was too young now, to know and still see that moment whenever she closed her eyes. \"But it wasn't the Box Trolls that did it,\" Winifred looked at her hands as she spoke, and Olive felt more regret at the thought that the child was now afraid to look her in the eye. The woman did not want the child to feel guilty about everything she had said, since Winifred had absolutely nothing to do with that. Wanting to comfort her, but knowing that hugging was never really something that the red haired child was okay with, (at least when it was Olive comforting her, she'd do anything for her father's attention), so Olive decided instead to kneel on her level, hand gentle under the cheek so Winifred would look her in the eye while Olive attempted a small smile. Apparently what the woman said next was somewhat surprising to the Box Trolls and Eggs, who looked somewhat confused. But then again they would be considering that from their view, Olive's emotions seemed to change around a lot, since so far, which was really in only a few moments, she had gone from the emotions of anger, to sadness, then odd calm with tears still falling. \"I always knew deep inside that they didn't, I just knew I could never prove it. And even then, I don't know who did,\" She didn't really need to further defend herself on that note, it seemed pretty obvious that there was no way for her to be able to tell anyone that the Box Trolls were innocent, even if she had proof of the crime being done by someone else, no one would listen. The fanaticism and prejudice against the Box Trolls by this point had gone on too far and for too long, people of this town was going to need more than just the word of one woman to convince any of them. \"I am the Trubsh- I am your… brother,\" Eggs also couldn't look her in eye, but on this occasion, mostly because Olive was convinced that she didn't know the boy, she didn't attempt to comfort him and instead looked to the ground herself. Olive felt such a heavy weight on her at this moment, she just wished that it would cut away so she could escape from this situation, but at the same time Olive knew that she had to face this, to either prove him, or herself wrong. \"Prove it,\" Her voice was so small in that moment, but she was no longer looking at the ground, staring instead into Egg's eyes, as he had also looked up at the same moment. Her heart may be bitter to the idea, but that didn't mean her head still didn't see some logic in the possibility of what he was saying was true. After all, as much as she didn't like to think it, she could see some resemblance of her mother and father in this boy, almost as clearly as she once saw it in herself. After almost whispering her statement, Olive wandered off a little away from the main group, enough for them to know that she wanted to be alone for a little while. Thankfully they granted this silent request, Winifred and Eggs wandering off elsewhere themselves to talk while Olive felt herself curl into a ball. Olive felt a sudden hand touch at her shoulder after a while of being alone, and she must have turned a little too quickly as the Box Troll that was the one that had tried to get her attention ducked into hiding inside their box. The woman didn't really raise an eyebrow at their deer-in-the-headlights nature, having known what they were like since she was a teenager and remembering that even back then they would hide whenever she walked into the room too quickly. The woman looked to the picture on this Box Troll, knowing that it was what their name would be, again having known their nature, and only raised an eyebrow when she saw what the picture that was on the Box Troll. A small smile fought its way across Olive's face at the thought that she had known this Box Troll back when she was a teenager, remembering how they had stolen the meatballs of the table whenever she was cooking for her family. How he had grown on her to the point that she allowed him to take a few meatballs without a comment. \"Hello Fish,\" Small yellow eyes looked back at her through the holes of the box, and she could see a small smile in reply in them. The Box Trolls head eventually poked out from his hiding place so Olive could see that for sure there was a smile of greeting across his face before he started speaking in the Box Troll language. Olive wasn't completely proficient in the language of the Box Trolls, but was lucky enough that in the time that the Box Trolls visited her father's home, she had managed to pick up a few words from the repetition of them, and sometimes having her father tell her what they meant so that she learned. It had been ten years since then, so some words were lost over time because of her trying to forget those times and also the effects of just plain time passing and her no longer remembering particular things. So from the very limited education on the language that Olive now had, she was at least able to salvage from Fish's statement that he was telling her that 'Eggs was telling the truth'. Thankfully the prior conversations filled in the many gaps of Box Troll words that she could not translate, so Olive was able to at least reply to his statement. \"I need more evidence than just words Fish. I'm sorry, but it's been too long, and too much has happened for me to just believe words, that my brother is standing right here. I need physical proof,\" The Box Troll now looked lost, thinking that there was nothing other than their word that they had to prove to Olive that Eggs was the brother she had mourned over for the past decade. At least, that was at first, until Fish remembered something that he knew for certain would be able to show what they were saying was true. Without bothering to say another word, the Box Troll suddenly wandered off through the almost cave like environment of their home, Olive watching him for a few moments with a raised eyebrow before falling back into her own thoughts. Of course Olive had always known inside that the Box Trolls weren't the ones that took her family and old life from her, but what also made her bitter to the world was the thought that she didn't know who might have actually done it. Well, she didn't know for certain, but with every passing year as she felt the same pair of eyes watch her as she matured and grew into a young woman, Olive started to get a very good idea of a certain someone who might have had something to do with it. But of course now she had practically heard it from the horse's mouth. Mr. Snatcher's comment earlier that day, on how he had 'stepped over Trubshaws in the past' was starting to haunt her the more she thought about it on her own. She had always had somewhat of a clue that he had something to do with it, what with the memories she had of him constantly harassing her family and threatening her father, and this comment seemed to finally solidify this idea she had concretely. Of course that didn't stop the thought that he had been there, right in the public eye all this time and watching her for all these years, and she hadn't really known it. It felt at that moment as if he had been silently congratulating himself in watching her self-destruct over something he did to her family, and she didn't even know it. That he had managed to wear the sheep's clothing despite of what she remembered of him as a teenager. It made her feel sad, sick, miserable in that she had all that time to figure it out and failed to do so. But what it also made her feel, was angry. Angry in that even if she had figured it out, that no one would have believed her anyway, just as she had stated before in if she had ever tried to defend the Box Trolls. No one would have believed her, and he would continue to be there, watching her from a distance. Her head felt dizzy at so many emotions, so many heart stopping sudden realizations and blooming hopes in her chest building on top of each other. The issue that Eggs could be her brother was conflicting to her enough in how much she wanted to believe it, but at the same time would also have to face that she had missed ten years of his life, nearly all of his childhood gone because of something she couldn't control as she never saw it coming. What happened that night? It seemed at that moment like it was always going to be a mystery to Olive, something that she would never really know for certain. At least, that was what the young woman thought until she felt the presence of someone standing in front of her, and despite herself and all her fears, looked up to face them. The first thing she had seen was what was in this person's hands. What this person was holding, was the evidence that they had to prove their claims to Olive as true. But that wasn't even close to being on her mind at that moment, as instead it seemed all her fears and worries about the present faded to the back of her mind as she looked upon this evidence, her thoughts instead being taken back a decade before. What they were holding, was a small pile of clothes. Small enough for a baby to wear. This was her baby brother's clothes. Olive knew this, because she was the one who made them. Her hands were shaking as they took the small green sweater and brown patched pants, holding them closer to her eye level as she looked over every stitch, feeling the sewing pattern she had made all those years ago, feeling her memories replay in her mind like old records she had long forgot and tried to ignore due to the pain it would regularly bring. Olive remembered that her brother was starting to really outgrow his baby clothes, the small bundle that he had been in the beginning quickly becoming a tiny terror of a more developed baby. The then fifteen year old watched the baby as he attempted to crawl around in his play pen, his tiny hands grasping at the far bigger soft toys that his sister managed to cobble together out of the left over fabric of the seamstresses' that she worked at. He was too small to really hold them, and so instead, for some reason, took to throwing the toys as far across the pen as far as his small arms could manage. As she watched her brother play, her hands were gently and slowly sowing heavy green material into a sweater, her expertise of sowing at that time not holding a candle to what they would be later on. Nevertheless as she did this action, Olive was thinking to herself all the while on how the winter was coming very soon and that the small infant was going to need more woolly jumpers and blankets to fight off the cold than what he had now. Her own protection against the winter didn't enter her mind all that much, considering herself shielded well enough from the cold by her trench coat for whenever she went outside. Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her father coming home, this action of his always being followed by him loudly proclaiming his entrance through the front door and singing somewhat off-key one of his many favorite songs, whether they be ones of the opera or a barber shop quartet. The baby giggled and squealed excitedly form his playpen as his father picked him up, spun him around before carefully handing the baby to the arms of his big sister, where Olive would then receive a tentative and caring kiss on her forehead from her father. It felt good, Olive remembered, to see her father smiling again after her mother's passing, the teenager thinking before that time, on how he had once been rather silent and unavailable to any attempt of discussion, and how it had made Olive feel a little more trapped in her ways than usual to not have him around as a conversational partner. But at this time it seemed as though he was picking himself back up to the man he had been before, though Olive could still see some sadness in his eyes when he guessed that she wasn't looking. But Olive threw that thought to the back of her mind because at that moment, he was happy, they were all happy. Dinner was made and served, with the usual fascinating conversation flowing between them before finally it got late enough that even the teenager was tired out from the day's efforts. The baby and his big sister were tucked into bed that night, however even as she was sitting in the bed, ready to sleep, she was still working on the small green jumper for her baby brother. \" It's time for bed now Olive,\" Herbert Trubshaw hummed softly to his eldest child as she eventually yielded to his wish for her to finally rest and laid down to sleep, the father gently taking her work from her hands an laying it carefully on the bedside table nearby, but of course not before he took a quick look over the definitely above amateur stitch work that the fifteen year old was capable of at the time, his expression beaming with pride as he gently tucked her in (despite the teenager's argument that she was too old to be tucked in, since he knew that deep down she enjoyed these moments she got to have with him). \" Truly wonderful work Olive, you're really learning the tools of your trade,\" Most other people of the town, that for some reason felt their opinion important on her families lives, had tried to remark to her father in the past on how encouraging her career as a seamstress was bound to have her forever unmarried, and at the time Olive was sad to state that she was worried he's agree with them and change his mind. But of course, he never did and instead continued to be proud of her work no matter what he heard whispered about him behind his back. But that was not what was causing the fifteen year old at the time to sigh in almost worry at his praise. It wasn't that she didn't appreciate the encouragement, quite the contrary, it was more that she didn't believe that for herself. See, the family line of Trubshaw had always had somewhat of a proud reputation of being thinkers and problem solvers, from professors to inventors there was always a story to tell, so it made for quiet the interesting history. Olive was worried, because of her chosen career that she was passionate about, in what it was and the fact that she didn't think herself all that good at it. This was a rather sore topic that she didn't bring up with her father all that often, in fact she did her best mostly to guide away from it. However, she was never very good at keeping her emotions to herself as he managed to see what it was that was making her sigh so sullenly. \" Olive, you don't have to prove yourself to anyone but you. Hats, boxes, sowing needles, they don't mean anything if you think they can change who you are. You make you,\" He said this a lot, practically whenever Olive felt down in that she couldn't do something right for someone else's benefit. It always made the teenager feel better inside, but only for a little while since for whatever reason, she never could really fully believe in that. Possibly because despite of that advice, Olive would always continue to try and make others happy before herself. \" Goodnight sweetheart,\" With that last word, her father quietly walked out of the room, pausing only to switch off the light. Olive laid awake in the dark for a moment, before turning over to look at her baby brother sleeping in the cot just by her bed. Her thoughts had wondered back to him, but this time weren't about how he might be cold in the winter if she didn't make more jumpers, instead they looked a bit more forwards into the future that she wondered and worried that he might have. She worried that the people that looked down on her now, that chastised her every move and tried more than once to educate her father on how to raise her so she was a good wife someday, would turn on him in much the same way. Olive fretted what he might face, and at what age it would start for him, since the chastising began as mostly whispers for her when she just began to reach ten years old. Would he be older when it would be his turn, or younger? What were they going to expect from him? What were they going to do when they figured that he wasn't meeting those expectations? Was it going to be anything like the heated glares and nasty words Olive received, that more often than not were delivered to her face with the shield of a 'well-meaning' smile? And more importantly, how was he going to react to all that, how strong would he be in the face of it? Olive knew that if it wasn't for her father and his strength, she would not be able to fight back against them and would instead bow to their very expectation and whim. It was her father's presence that made her stronger, and also made her certain that if her brother ever faltered under the gaze of society's anticipations, that both her, and her father would be there for him for every step that he needed them. They could tear her down all they liked, just as long as it left her brother always standing tall in the face of adversity, ready to fight back and say who it was he wanted to be. All this certainty, Olive reflected to herself, and he was barely even a year old. The then teenager turned in her bed so she was now facing the bedside table, where the nearly finished green sweater was sitting, just waiting to be finished. With a new sense of enthusiasm that Olive wasn't quite sure from where it had come from, she sat up in her bed and carefully collected the half done sweater, feeling the familiar cold of the meal sewing needles in her nimble and precise fingers as the thread went in, and out. The pattern continued on as for a time there was nothing else in Olive's world except the contents in her hands, and the small snores of the baby sleeping nearby. The sweater was done by the morning, and Olive for a time felt better because of it. \"Oh my god,\" Other than that exclamation, Olive's voice was now lying dead in her throat, the surprise and shock as facts finally clicked into her mind having killed it away to silence. Her hands were shaking as her world became nothing more for those few moments than the contents that were about to fall through her fingers. But of course she didn't allow it to, instead holding onto even tighter. It seemed as though she had let more than enough slip through her fingers for the past decade. Her gaze remained on the sweater for so long that when Olive managed to find the strength to look up who it was that had handed her these long forgotten items, her neck cracked in a way that made it feel ancient, as if she had been carrying quite the mighty weight on her shoulders, which wasn't exactly untrue. Now, when she looked up, instead of feeling pain, Olive felt some of that weight fall away and collapse into the dust it had always been. When she looked up, she met Egg's gaze as he stared back at her. \"Winnie says… that you're my sister,\" Olive seemed to finally really see Eggs as he was talking, and was now so confused as to how she could ever try to deny that he was her brother. He looked so much like her father, at least like her father did when he was Egg's age in the photos she had managed to save. A hand fell away to one of her secret pockets, where instead of the others which held emergency sewing supplies, had a photo instead. Olive pulled out the photo, looking down at it for a moment, feeling the long held back nostalgia flood through her veins before remembering that Eggs was looking to, and carefully handed it to him to hold. The slight touch of their fingers meeting as she passed the photograph making her heart nearly break. The woman wanted nothing more than to just hug him close to her, for him to somehow feel the emptiness that was once in her heart, slowly filling back up again. But Olive wouldn't do that to him, sensing that the boy was a little cautious of her, unsure of whether or not she was actually safe. And as much as that hurt inside, at the same time she understood where he was coming from, especially since Olive had given him plenty of reasons to be hesitant about her, what with her rather emotional and possibly frightening moment just before, which the woman felt rather embarrassed about now that she looked back on it, but then again that was a lot of emotions that she had been bottling away for ten years. Eggs was carefully inspecting the photograph in his hands, holding it much like she always did, as if it were made of glass and could shatter in his fingers at any moment. The picture was taken during a cheese fair that Olive and her father had gone to, the small baby that Eggs once was going along with them. And so they were the focus of the photograph, just the three of them on the last family outing they would ever have. The photograph was of the three of them, her father standing over the teenager Olive, a careful and caring hand on her shoulder as she held her brother in his arms. Their smiles then were genuine, a feeling that Olive had long since forgotten the sensation of, having spent the past ten years smiling when she only ever felt hollow inside. On this occasion however, as she looked back at the brother she had long thought dead, the smile that found its way across her expression was definitely real. \"Is this our father?\" Eggs' voice was so small at that time, but still Olive had to fight off the need to comfort him, instead just nodding carefully in reply. The young boy eventually, and very slowly, moved to sit down next to the woman, his hands still carefully holding the last picture that was taken of their family before it was ripped apart. Thinking about it caused the ever familiar sting in the corner of her eyes, as before Olive could hold herself back she let her question slip. \"Do you know… wh-what happened to him, where he is?\" Olive used present tense in the last part of her question as her hopes climbed higher than really should have been allowed. The woman wanted this to be like a dream come true where her father was also here, just waiting for her around the corner where they could all be a happy family again. But when Eggs finally replied, the hopes she allowed to soar to such highest, flew to close to the sun and burned up almost instantly. \"The Red Hats killed him,\" Her lip trembled, an action Olive didn't bother to hold back as her hands moved to cover her face as the woman felt herself break all over again. And yet, unlike ten years ago, she couldn't allow herself to just fall into grief, because as much as she wanted to think that this was a complete shock, it just wasn't. Olive had always had a feeling that Mr. Snatcher had something to do with the tearing a part of her family, in fact he had almost practically admitted to it just recently. Olive had always had an inkling, something in the back of her mind that made her doubt the story that the Red Hats had told her and the rest of Cheesebridge. It was because of that lingering doubt and other factors that Olive couldn't allow herself to just fall apart all over again. The other factors being that she had already allowed herself to break to pieces earlier today, there was no need to do it again. And, she was also sitting next to her long lost brother, and really if anything he must be having a rather terrible and life changing day as well, so there was no need to dump this on top of it for him. So, with every ounce of inner strength that she could manage to find at that time, Olive moved her hands away and breathed carefully until sobs no longer interrupted the process. There was strength in her, left behind from her father, and the woman would be damned if she wasn't going to use it. Besides, there was something else that needed to be asked now that Olive felt as though she had all the answers to her family's current state. \"What happens now?\" Eggs didn't allow for the conversation to fall into silence much like Olive would have in his place, instead going on to describe exactly what had happened for him that day, the woman finally getting to discover what had happened for him and Winifred in that factory before she had arrived. What she heard wasn't surprising, but that didn't mean it didn't make her blood boil to a certain degree, especially since it was a scenario that had placed her only brother and the child that had been under her care since she was an infant. Well, at least it explained, in a small way anyway, exactly how and why Mr. Gristle had been flying out the window as she had seen before she entered the factory herself. But it wasn't Egg and Winifred's daring escape that her brother seemed all that interested in telling Olive about really, despite the woman's rebuttals in that being told exactly what happened, in order to make sure that her brother and Winifred had escaped completely unscathed. \"Before we managed to get out of the factory, the Red Hats opened up some kind of workshop that was underneath the floorboards, and all the Boxtrolls that were taken are under there-\" Olive didn't really think much on interrupting him, though if it had been anyone else the woman would have been immediately apologetic. But in any case Olive interrupted him as she talked about her own experience in the factory, decidedly leaving out the proposal that still made her stomach churn sometimes. \"I heard a voice under those floorboards when I was there, but it didn't sound like a Boxtroll,\" Eggs raised his eyebrow at this added information, before reaching a sudden memory of his own to build on top of that. \"I think… I saw someone with the Boxtrolls that were being held down there, but I didn't get a good look at them…\" Olive nodded softly, delving mostly into her thoughts on the fact that some other poor soul had been dragged into this mess as well. Someone that along with the Boxtrolls needed to be saved from whatever it was that the Red Hats were planning to use them for. \"Winnie says that her father can help us fight against the Red Hats, to show everyone that they're not monsters,\" Olive couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at this sudden proclamation that Eggs had made, unable to stop the cynicism that instantly flowed through her mind at the thought that Lord Portley-Rind would help anyone but himself and his white hat. Still, with the look of such hope that was now brightening her little brother's face, she didn't have it in her to shoot him down. Eggs stood back on his feet, looking back down at the photograph in his hands before carefully holding it out for her to take it back, a question following quickly behind it. For a moment, Olive had to admit that she faltered, unsure on her answer for what it could mean for her and Egg's future should what he was proposing fail. But that was only for a few seconds of being unsure as she instantly then reminded herself that this was her brother, and she would do anything for her family. \"Will you help us?\" Olive carefully took the photo back, hiding away in the secret pocket of her skirts once more before smiling back at Eggs, her answer already certain to him before she even said. He knew this as he could almost read it immediately in her smile. \"Yes, I'll help you,\" Again Olive wanted nothing more than to hug her brother, but still knew that he wouldn't be comfortable with that, so she settled on the fact that he was here, and was smiling so gratefully at her. This moment was enough to her, it definitely felt that as a memory it would be enough for quite few years if she was ever found herself to be alone again. Nevertheless, Olive felt this almost blissful certainty that she wasn't going to really be alone again. This moment was interrupted however, by the sudden arrival of Winifred, who entered in much like she was best known to do anything with her personality, which was quick with a side of bossy brashness that she never seemed to be able to tame for the sake of politeness. Olive didn't feel the energy to reprimand her for that and so instead just took a quick breath to ready herself for the child's demands. \"We could go to my daddy's party tonight to convince him Eggs!\" Eggs looked somewhat apprehensive, yet still enthusiastic to take action. However a few seconds after she had spoken, Winifred seemed to actually take in the boy's full appearance for the first time since meeting him, and unintentionally wrinkled her nose in a fashion that one would when smelling something rather bad and not wanting to say so out loud. \"Well… Miss Olive we may need to make Eggs a suit to wear…\" Before she could help herself, a large excited smile crossed Olive's face as her hand moved to the secret pockets of her skirts, pulling out a rather long thread and needle, ready for use. Winifred smiled back at her, Eggs meanwhile looking somewhat confused before becoming a slight bit mortified when the small red haired child turned back to him. \"Okay, first things first, time to lose the box,\" Oh this was going to go just swell, Olive could just already tell from her brother's mortified expression. Please review, constructive criticism always welcome. ","Summary":" It had been a cold night in Cheesebridge, the wind howling through empty streets as dreary rain spa"},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Heartless","Author":"Dis Kid","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10768995","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Everyone could only celebrate. Snatcher was gone, they knew the truth about the boxtrolls and they now had a new addition to their family, Eggs. Well, he actually came with quite a few additions but most were still rather uncomfortable with them. Yes, everyone appreciated their genius and skill in engineering and whatnot, but it was still hard to get use to the idea that those so called monsters of the night we actually very friendly and would never do you any harm. Some were still very frightened of the trolls but it was okay, because others were confident they'd come around soon enough. Finally, after who knew how long, the people of Cheesebridge decided to expand their contact and go much further with trade and even started allowing foreigners inside! Before they were cautious and stubborn but they saw this is age as an opportunity to take risks. Eggs was proud of them, as was Winnie. New children came through, funny old men who had great stories to tell along with gifts like strange trinkets and toys. Everyone was happier now. Some wondered if they could really stay this way, what with others slowly retreating back into their homes, almost as if they'd become overwhelmed. It was a lot to get use to but they were an outgoing city, at least that's what they convinced themselves. On this particular morning Winnie was going out for very important business. A school had opened up near the end of last year, a newer concept to the city. Other places had apparently had schools for a very long time but here everyone was tutored at home and simply knew things. But, determined to keep up with the rest of the world they waited for the right time to let everyone in. Picking staff was hard, she had heard, but they were confident they had a good one. Walking along the road, avoiding the horses and carriages that clogged the streets, mostly from foreigners, she spotted a familiar face. Now all dressed up and clean, like a proper boy, Eggs had been making his rounds. \"Eggs? Why are you still here? Don't you want to try out the school?\" She asked him. \"Uh, well, as much as I'd like to I still have things to do around here. I can't really just drop everything and go.\" He said sadly. She smiled. \"Of course you can! I'm sure someone wouldn't mind helping you out while you're away. After all, education is the most important thing for us young folks.\" He pondered for a moment, pulling strange faces and making sounds. Moments later he nodded, handing his clipboard to Fish. \"You're right. Fish, please take over for me for now, I have to go.\" Winnie smiled victoriously and pulled his arm along with her. \"Come on, we mustn't be late! It's the first day!\" They stopped in front of a large building that toward over the nearby houses. \"Whoa..\" They said in unison. Around there were children clinging to their guardians, begging them not to go. They were scared and it was understandable, but Winnie was sure it would be fun, especially if all the stories the other children from out of town told her about schools were true. \"How do we do this? Do we just walk in?\" Eggs asked nervously. \"Yes. There should be some sort of list in there to tell us where we go. They walked in and sure enough there was a giant wall painted with names and numbers, instructing children what to do. Winnie ran straight up to it. \"They've sorted us through age...\" Eggs stared at the words. Some of these he couldn't read, having never seen them before. \"Oh, I think We're in the same room! They've given us our first class and then we get personal instructions from there.\" Children of all sizes and ages stared at the board and separated, some going upstairs, some going down, some staying on the same floor, and some simply leaving, feeling that it was already too difficult. Eggs and Winnie were at the very top of the floors. The classroom was dark and dank, cheap old chairs situated around an old table. They sat together and waited for their teacher. There were six other children in the room. One had dark greasy hair and tanned skin, he looked dirty and his clothing were ripped and worn. Winnie suspected they had never been washed. Two girls were twins, very short with fair skin and light brown hair with pink little dresses. They were leaning as far away from the boy as they could. One boy was short and blond, wearing something akin to a blue sailor uniform. Anther was sleeping, his dirty red hair puffed up to impossible heights, extremely thin and tall. The last girl was very thick with a lilac dress. Her hair was dark brown and her cheeks were so full you could barely see her eyes open. It was an odd group but what you got was what you got. Then the teacher came in. She was a short old woman with white hair pulled back into a bun and a dark brown dress. Her back was hunched and she took tiny quick steps. \"Okay class,\" she said, her voice worn and old. \"Today I have a special announcement. The school board started this year completely unprepared. We only received one topic to talk about in our classes, not much we can do with that. Our topic is more hands on. Because we were given no materials, we will be taking a field trip. Consider yourselves lucky, the first day and you're already getting a break. As it turns out this lesson was inspired by our recent turn of events in this city. Yes, I'm talking about the issue with the boxtrolls and the boy.\" If anyone had been dozing off they were suddenly very awake. Every child in Cheesebridge wanted to know more about the story, and now they were getting a field trip based off of it. \"In a place not too far from here there seemed to be a similar situation. Not with boxtrolls per say, but with another creature. They called them mimics, very dangerous. At least they have no misunderstandings. These creatures are dangerous and are very untrusting towards other races, towards outsiders, like us. They live in the forest and in the caves of Juntin. They say these beasts will pray on any living creature that dwells too close to it's home, so keep your distance. They too have picked up a human child some years ago.\" Eggs perked up, staring at the old woman, eyes almost challenging her. He didn't believe it, could there be more like him? \"The beasts have been rather friendly since the people fought back, taking prisoners and offing them. They're trying to make a treaty but their leader won't allow it. Now the boy is said to be the most sad creature they've ever looked upon. Starved, injured, missing limbs, long matted hair. This child was not cared for, not like these monsters could! The townspeople have managed to rescue the boy but have been unable to tame him thus far. We are going to take a look at what they can offer us and study his trauma.\" she paused. \"Perhaps we can make a few comparisons between him and you, Eggs.\" Everyone turned their attention to Eggs and Winnie. He sunk back into his seat, nervous to have everyone's eyes so suddenly on him. Then they spilled out of the room following their new teacher. Later that day everyone came back with suitcases of things prepared for the trip. The ride would take an hour and a half to get across the water to the city but they were willing to wait. Everyone fell asleep as soon as the boat started to float away anyway, having rather not staying awake the whole ride. When everyone was woken up by the teacher, whose name they learned was Mrs. Frink, they stared in awe at the mass coming up from behind the fog. A small city, not build up on a large hill like Cheesebridge, but staying flat on even ground. The boat stopped and the class entered the city. Much to their surprise, it was disgusting. The houses were mostly broken and it was infested with bugs and rats. There seemed to be a deathly still person laying in every dark place, possibly dead. \"I think I'd be thankful if monsters stole me from a place like this.\" Winnie shivered, Eggs nodding his head in agreement. Mrs. Frink told them to wait outside of a small slightly more stable looking place while she spoke to the mayor of the city. Shadows from every part of the town grew as if they were getting closer, dark figures stretching across a dirt road. The children huddled together, shaking wildly. Field trips were suppose to be fun but they had yet to experience anything other than fear and disgust. Suddenly the shadows retreated, much to their relief, as the old woman came back out, a plump man following. He faced the group and sighed, not even trying for a smile. \"Good evening, youngsters. I am the mayor of this fine city and I welcome you to this magnificent place.\" His voice was flat and monotone, a little high for most men in Cheesebridge, but then again it wasn't Cheesebridge, it was Juntin. \"Mr. Grump has given us permission to see the boy they rescued from the monsters. Thank him, children.\" Everyone let out a quick thanks and followed Mrs. Frink down a little ways. There was a staircase that swirled underground, heavily guarded by armed men with biceps bigger than Winnie's head. They were lead deep under the city to a series of metal hallways. They walked and walked and walked until there was finally a door. It was big, red lights surrounded it and there were cautions and keep out signs strapped to it. Eggs stared in confusion. If this boy was innocent and rescued, why did they hide him in such a place like he was some sort of criminal? The doors were slowly pulled open, darkness filling their visions. Literally, it was nothing but darkness. There was no lights in the room and it was deathly silent. One could faintly see an outline of a giant cage and the soft snoring of a living being. Mrs. Frink was handed a lantern by one of the guards. The cage could be clearly made out now. It was enormous, so much so that you couldn't see the top or back of it, though the bottom hung near Winnie's waist. The children squinted and urged their teacher to hold the lantern closer. Several minutes had gone by and there was nothing, even the snoring stopped. Mrs. Frink handed the lantern to Eggs and began mentioning some things she found out while speaking to the mayor about the boy. \"He's in this cage, not as punishment, but so the monsters cannot find him. Once they have a scent they never let it go so this ended up being the safest option for his well being.\" She continued to ramble on, having drawn the attention of all but one student. Eggs ignored her as he pressed the lantern right to the cage and peered in, hoping to see something. A figured moved somewhere too far back for details, but it was enough to send a shiver down Eggs's back. Still, he stared, unable to look away as it inched closer. The first cleanly visible thing was a hand that stuck out toward the light. The skin was pale and the nails grew long and were sharpened to a point, like a poor attempt at acquiring claws. More of the boy was slowly being revealed. His arm had scars, looking like a creature with knives for fingers had grabbed at him multiple times throughout his life. They wrapped around the thin limbs, a clear thumb nail joining the marks. Suddenly there was cloth, white and folded. It was smudged with lots of dirt and there was a bit of dried blood. \"Eggs, what are you doing?\" He jumped as Winnie came up next to him to look into the cage, but the arm had retreated back into the darkness. \"I was trying to get a look but I don't see anything.\" He lied. \"Right, well, according to Mrs, Frink we're staying at an Inn tonight and tomorrow night. I'm sure we'll be back here, maybe we'll get to see something next time.\" Eggs nodded and followed the rest of the class out of the door and back up to the fresh air. He hoped he could get the boy to come out completely next time. He didn't even remember climbing up three flights of stairs and crawling into a horribly uncomfortable bed, or falling asleep while the greasy haired boy squawked and chased a terrified blond boy around the room. AN: UUHHHHHH So I literally just finished watching this movie in theaters. Seriously love everything Laika does. I immediately thought this out, actually I thought it out about half way through the movie, and I decided that this time I'm actually going to write it down. I was horrified by how little fanfictions exist of this, especially since Raise of the Guardians had fanfictions from people admitting that they haven't even seen the movie O_O So, I hope the few of you out there actually want me to continue because this is the first story I've posted so far. I will most likely go back to fix this first chapter at some point in the future but for now I'll just keep adding until it's all done! Any reviews will be greatly appreciated![Chapter 2] Eggs wasn't sure how it happened but he found himself in front of the cage again. There didn't seem to be anyone else around. ' Is it still night?' He questioned silently. There were no lights, no lantern and the doors were closed so even the red lights just outside could provide no help. Something in the cage moved, startling Eggs who tried to hide. It was a habit he hadn't quite dropped. Quickly, he popped back up and cleared his throat. \"Hello?\" He called. Faintly a figure came into view. It was bone thin, crawling like an ape on skinny arms. It stood on wobbly legs and Eggs's eyes widened. A pale boy stood before him, covered heavily in scars. His hair was long and black, hanging past his waist in matted clumps. One eye looked pale and lifeless, like he was blind, and the other had been sewn shut. There was a lot of scar tissue, he figured the boy had lost it thanks to whatever made the rest of the scars. The boy fell to his knees, unable to keep himself up, the clawed hand shooting out and gripping Eggs's sleeve. The hold was weak and fragile. A small plea fell from his lips. \"Please... let me out...\" Eggs nodded and ran as fast as he could to the back of the cage a large door was sealed shut by five locks. He panicked and searched desperately for the keys. A glimmer caught his eye. There was a glowing board on the wall that required a large key. They must have been in there but he couldn't open it. 'Pick it, boy!' A voice hissed in the back of his mind. No, he hadn't brought anything that could aid him in this task. His mind suddenly stopped thinking and noticed that all noise had gone. He could no longer see anything, no outlines and could hear no breathing. From the darkness a quiet hissing sound began picking up volume, eventually joined by growls and snarls. They got louder and louder. Eggs covered his ears and backed up, hitting a wall and pressing himself against it. He'd grown very use to the troll language over his lifetime, which consisted mostly of growls and snarls, the occasional hissing, but this was different. It was much deeper and more animal-like. He couldn't understand any of it but they sounded angry. It started hurting and he couldn't hear himself scream. \"Please wake up, Mr Eggs, it's morning.\" Eggs shot up into a sitting position, smacking his head right into the blond boy's. They both fell and groaned in pain, waking the red head and the greasy boy. \"Too early, need more rest.\" stated the redhead. He laid back down and began snoring immediately. \"I've woken him three times already, I'm starting to worry...\" the blond stuttered. There was a loud knock on the door. \"Come on, boys, we have to meet Mrs. Frink outside. Now!\" Winnie's voice woke everyone but this time the stayed up. Mrs. Frink had an irritated look on her face when they arrived. \"We've taken to long just getting you out of your rooms, we must leave at once.\" They hurried to the Mayor's office, avoiding the plump rats in the road. This time it seemed he had something set up. Little crudely put together booklets with badly drown monsters surrounding a sick baby on the cover were given to each student. Winnie and Eggs cringed as they looked through the pictures. It was nothing but shadowed illustrations of beast tormenting the city and the assumed cycle of the boy's upraising. He was stolen from his home as a toddler and forced to learn the ways of a mimic. This included eating mostly human hearts and eyes while stealing anything that shined. It showed people making deals with them to kill their enemies. Eggs closed his book with a frown while Winnie stared at the pages, contemplating on whether or not she should believe it or if they were more lies like the boxtroll rumors. They were given the option of going to see the boy again or looking at mimic footprints. The twins and chubby girl didn't want to go back down to the cage, thinking it was scary but boys were boys and Winnie was Winnie, so their votes won. Down the spiral staircase they walked and into the dark eerie silence once again. The girls stuck close to Mrs. Frink and to the light of the lantern. Once they were there attention was called to Mrs. Frink immediately and she instructed them to open their books and listen. Eggs had too much on his mind to do so. Instead he sneaked away and around the side, keeping a careful eye on the cage. He'd admit that it frightened him, someone being in there and having the potential to reach out and scare him to death at any time. The light was fading as he went further back away from the others and struggled to keep himself from stumbling. He reached the back and sighed in relief at the lack of a following presence. The nightmare had a permanent image in his head of what the boy looked like and it was something he wasn't prepared to see in real life yet. To Eggs's surprise there was a door sealed with five locks and a board on the wall sealed with one, just like the dream. Pulling multiple small tools out of his jacket he began to sweat. Picking locks and stealing keys to release a stranger from a heavily guarded prison cell, Fish would be horrified with how Eggs was developing. Shoe probably wouldn't be too surprised but he also had much lower standards. The lock clicked open and was shoved into Eggs's pocket. Sure enough there was a keyring carrying only five keys. The accuracy of the dream was startling. He hesitated before grabbing the set and carefully closing the board and replacing the lock, as if it never happened. Turning to the cage he smiled nervously. \"Hello?\" He whispered, hoping to get the attention of the boy. There was some shifting before a dark figure stood before him, but it was too dark to see what he looked like. Eggs cursed in his head. He can't let the other out, it's for his own safety, even if it looks horrible. Yes, it's a giant metal cage sitting in the dark and guarded by monsterously muscled men, but it was to keep the beasts out... right? 'No,\" Hissed a familiar voice in his head 'It's all to keep the child in. Why would they need to do this?' He thought about it. The voice was right. They knew something about the boy that he didn't, in fact they knew a lot more, so he should let them make the calls. 'They are going to kill him. They think he's one of them!' It continued urgently. Well that changed everything. Eggs wasn't one to argue with his conscious, even if the decision was a tricky one. After unlocking the door what would he even do? Surely they won't let the class just walk out with him, they'd definitely notice! A soft tapping noise drew his attention to the cage. The boy was tapping on the lock. He stuck his arm through the bars and offered something. It was a gear, and from what Eggs's could see it wasn't copper, it was gold. The hand shifted for a handshake. He wanted to make a deal. The gold gear for freedom. Another glance at the gear and he'd decided. For someone raised by simple engineers, it was a sign of great respect and a rare find yet the other was willing to give it up. He shook the hand, which was much colder and stronger than he thought it would be, and pocketed the gear. Climbing the cage to the first lock was a challenge, it was pretty high. Relieved to find it wasn't rusted enough to squeak he continued until the very last one. Looking back to the boy he flashed a hopeful smile. The last lock clicked and the room went silent. \"Where's Eggs?\" He heard Mrs. Frink ask. Quickly and quietly he ran back and sneaked just behind Winnie. \"Ah, there you are! I thought you'd run off for a moment I would've turned livid.\" She let out a nervous chuckle and lead the class out of the room. Eggs shot a worried glance at the cage as the large metal doors were sealed shut again. All day he couldn't get it out of his head. He'd unlocked everything but had to leave immediately. What else did he expect? More time couldn't change the fact that the other still couldn't walk through those doors with everyone. \"Eggs?\" Winnie stepped back as he let out a yelp of surprise. \"Are you okay? You've been staring at that beetle for a while now..\" Sure enough there was a dead beetle turned over on the table in front of Eggs. He sighed. Could he really tell her what he did? He could trust her, right? \"I opened it.\" His mouth moved without the consent of his brain. \"What?\" She asked \"I..\" letting out another sigh he turned to face here, looking deep into her eyes. \"I opened to door. I let him out.\" Her eyes widened in horror and fascination. \"Don't tell anyone!\" He quickly added. \"Is he here?\" She looked around and under the table for something out of place but could find nothing. \"No. I mean, I opened the door but I didn't exactly think about how we'd get him out. He's still there.\" He pulled a deep frown. Opening the door might have been a waste of time. He just wanted the boy to have freedom. It would have been nice if they could have been friends but it didn't look possible anymore. They sat in silence and pondered their next move. There was still a day left. Maybe they could bring some sort of disguise next time. The day was spent on plans ruled out one after another until they finally accepted that it couldn't be done. They both had trouble sleeping that night, knowing that a boy, an innocent human being like themselves, would spend forever in a cage in a room that rarely saw light. A miserable and pointless existence was the only future ahead for him and it wasn't fair. But what could they do? Everyone woke up on their own in the morning, some hours before others. Eggs only ended getting a single hour of sleep before the loudness of his roommates woke him up. \"Henry, you've gotta hold him up higher or this won't work!\" The redhead, Henry, was holding the small blond boy high in the air, nearly touching the ceiling while the tan boy stood on the bed and tied a rope to a loose beam, the other end tied around the blond's middle. \"Shut up, Dick, he's high enough.\" The other snapped. Henry had bags under his eyes as if the sleep he got, which was a lot, wasn't enough. Eggs suspected he needed at least two days for a full rest. The rope was given a final tug and Dick nodded at Henry, who in turn lowered the blond so he was hanging in mid air. They laughed and the blond squirmed. \"This isn't amusing in the slightest! Let me down!\" He yelled. The other two looked at each other before smiling and shaking their heads. They continued to snicker as they walked out of the door and left. Eggs sighed and walked over to the human decoration. \"At least this is the last day you have to spend with them.\" He tried to reason. The blond shook his head. \"They live on either side of me. When we leave this place they will simply go back to throwing cheese at my bedroom window and stomping all over mother's garden. She always blames me I'll have you know!\" He frowned. \"They cover their fingers in saliva and stick them in my ears. They even made a 'charity' for all the bullies to join in on. 'Wet Willies for Willy', what a horrid name. Because of them everyone calls me Willy! I hate that name, I just want to be called William!\" Eggs looked at the other sympathetically. He didn't have any bullies but he imagined it was terrible. He helped William down and they walked downstairs together, formerly introducing themselves. William was from a wealthy family of musicians who expected him to follow suit, which he planned to. Currently he played the violin and cello and was excited to start his piano lessons soon. When they joined the others outside with Mrs. Frink she looked at them sadly. \"Class, I'm afraid we must leave early. There has been a city crisis and they think it would be safer if we went back. Please go get your things.\" Everyone groaned and went back to their rooms to pack. Eggs's mind was racing. City Crisis? Does it have something to do with the boy? Did they find out? Did he escape somehow? There were too many questions unanswered and it made him extremely nervous. His hands were shaking and he hoped no one would notice. Everyone boarded the boat once again and found it was too early to sleep, except for Henry who had no issues, so they took to antagonizing each other instead and driving Mrs. Frink crazy. It had been three days since the trip and Eggs and Winnie had been too busy with other things to dwell on the mysterious boy they'd almost released. As it turned out school made working and hobbies a lot hard to enjoy. There was work, a lot of work, especially since the school straightened some things out and there was no more fun. The children went home tired and fussy and complained more than their parents did. Eggs nearly collapsed when he came home, earning a worried look from Fish. Even if he'd found his real father it could never undo the bond they shared. Sometimes it got awkward between him and Herbert but never with Fish. \"Sorry. It's just been a long day.\" He said into a pillow. Fish responded in what sounded like gibberish and Eggs nodded in agreement. He too thought the school should be shorter if only to give everyone a break. The rest of the day dragged on too slowly convincing Eggs to sleep early. He wasn't the only one either. Winnie decided to do the same. She got ready for the night and sat down on the bed with a glass of water while reading a book. It was her favorite and she'd read it a hundred times by now but it would never stop her from reading it again. When the sky went dark she closed the book and set it on the bedside table next to her half full glass. No one dreamed that night and everyone slept restlessly. They felt like they were being watched and the feeling of anxiety kept them turning. In the morning complaints could be heard all over about certain things going missing. For Winnie it looked like someone had snuck in through the window and drank her water which she found strange. The only clue left behind was a small silver gear in it's place. But who would steal water and leave silver? She'd consult Eggs. It could have been a boxtroll, after all it was a little silly and they were rather strange. Harmless but very strange indeed. AN: LOOK AT THAT ANOTHER CHAPTER! I thought I'd get it out yesterday but I had no time and school is a time consuming thing. Sorry about the bad writing I haven't edited anything. I will someday though. I'd like to thank everyone reading this story because you're awesome. I know there are only so many of you but I'd really love to hear some feedback from you! Critic, random comments, suggestions, stuff like that! I'd like to thank my first reviewer for making my day. Seeing positive feedback so far really makes this more fun o3o[Chapter 3] The first sign of bad luck was when Mrs. Frink went crazy. She insisted that there was a man who lived under her bed and dwelled in the darkest parts of her home, remaining unseen but making his presence known through his voice and movements. There was no denying that he was there, you could tell his exact position but it was always too dark to see his features. She said he kept pulling her clocks apart and ate every speck of food she brought home except for cheese which he hated and criticized her for eating. The detail she went into when trying to describe every aspect of him was startling. You'd think she'd imagined him forever but it was only a week. She was locked away in a mad house. When children began telling their parents about a similar friend, one who stayed in the shadows and hated cheese, people started getting concerned. They blamed in on Mrs. Frink's insane ramblings and how they felt horrible for letting her around their poor impressionable children. But it was being taken too far when food began mysteriously disappearing from the kitchens and pantries of wealthy families. Mr. Debrum was the most nosy and angry of citizens in Cheesebridge. \"Hear them Lullel girls been squawkin' bout that damn shadow boy. Lil' trickster'll be goin' straight ta Hell when I'm through with 'im.\" Ms. Delphine had only sympathy for young unruly kids. \"Oh no, he ain't doing this outta spite, can't be a bad kid, just needs a bit o love. I'm betting his parents must be right mean now for a boy to act out like this. Just needs to be reminded that people care is all.\" There was also a young beginning lawyer who took his job into everything. \"I can't imagine the charges that boy will have against him. He's breaking into people's homes and stealing their food, psychologically torturing a woman into madness, simply wearing down the good folks of this city! Maybe he's just got something wrong with his head. In that case I'd have to suggest we find him some help instead of imprisonment. Punishment only makes these types of people worse, you know!\" Even through all of the banter only one person was really starting to understand what was going on. Eggs had searched frantically but nowhere could he find him. He even left his window open with lots of food set up on a table and still there was no sign of him. It was almost as if the boy was avoiding Eggs, like he just didn't want to bother him. He sighed and shook his head. It was ridiculous how hard he was trying to get robbed for one simple look, for a word, for anything. He just needed to see if it was all true. There was a knock on his door and it was immediately opened by Fish. He grumbled something about his jar of nails being emptied and stolen. The jar, not the nails. Eggs groaned. Fish lived in the same house and even he was getting more visits! The troll gestured to the necklace Eggs was wearing. He'd never seen it before but it must have been rather important. \"This?\" Eggs lifted the gold object into sight. \"It was given to me by... by a friend.. well, I hope we're friends but I haven't seen him since he gave it to me.\" He stated quietly and he gazed at the shiny gold gear between his fingers. He had put it on a string and wore it as a necklace since that night back in Juntin. Fish smiled and nodded. He gestured to the night sky and told Eggs to go to bed. They were all nocturnal before, some boxtrolls still were, but for the most part they had gotten use to the day time and now shared a human schedule. They still liked to sleep in a neat stack and saw no reason to give up on that. But Eggs didn't. He had a normal bed now but sometimes he'd go down there and join them once more. This was not going to be one of those nights. He had too much on his mind. He said goodnight to Fish and waited until the door closed before he got up and went over to the window. Looking out you could see the lights of the houses go out as they all went to sleep. Soon there was no one left up and he decided to followed suit. Leaving the window open again he turned away to go to bed, completely missing the shadow now creeping along the building rooftops. Eggs took off the necklace and laid down, giving the gear one last glance before closing his eyes. 'These fools know naught what horrors await them. How can they sleep so willingly, so peacefully knowing there is one who sneaks into their rooms while they are most vulnerable?' A small voice hissed into the mind of a pale boy. \"There are no horrors awaiting them, you idiot. I don't want to hurt anyone. I just want their stuff and feel they should share with those less fortunate, like myself.\" He answered casually. He was use to them speaking inside his head instead of out loud. They could whisper in his head but they couldn't out loud. Instead it becomes huge and booming in the ears of everyone around, like some divine being was speaking to them from beyond the veil. The boy took out flat knife, thin as paper. He slipped the tool between the crack of a closed window and pulled it to the side, forcing the window open. His long legs quietly found the floor and slipped past two sleeping forms. Then he stopped and went back, snatching the woman's earrings and jeweled necklace. He left and entered a hallway and made his way toward the bedroom across the hall. A child's bedroom as it was pink and full of toys and small dresses. Most toys were like the ones in houses before. Most were the same stupid doll that little girls and the occasional boy seemed to like and a bunch of tea sets. Buried under a pile of extra decorative pillows thrown to the floor was a red book. The words were short and formed a few sentences before skipping a line and continuing. The boy recognized it as a poem book. He couldn't read yet but he wanted to. Back home there was an abundance of stolen books and notes he'd saved for the day he could read them. The pile was getting impressive but he was forced to leave most of them behind when he boarded a boat and rode to a new place. Well, he might as well start collecting again. Usually there wasn't much to find in children's rooms but this time was different. He opened the closet and was suddenly attacked by an army of fluffy toys. Stuffed animals. They were soft and squishy and for once he couldn't help himself. He took every last one. There was a lot to carry so it was the only intentional treasure hunt he'd go on that night. Everything was hauled back into an old woman's home. She was dragged away by some people not too long ago leaving him alone with her blind and half deaf husband, which he had no problem with because it made hiding easier. He'd made a cozy nest in a secret room in her basement. It wasn't big enough to stand in and in was made of ice cold stone bricks but over time he planned on covering it with warm blankets and possibly keeping one of those candles down there. He situated the stuffed animals around the sides and placed the book near the small entrance. Now for food. \"Who's there?!\" He held in his surprised squeak and jumped into the nest. He forgot to be quiet and woke the man, otherwise known as Franklin Frink. \"I'm locking you in here, whoever you are!\" The old man yelled and the door closed with a loud bang, a click signalling entrapment. The boy growled and hissed at the door in resentment. There were other ways out of the cellar. He crawled out of his hiding spot and eyed an old rusty crate across the black room. After being the dark for so long he could see just fine without the light. His attention was called to a piece of metal he'd accidentally kicked away from him while walking. It was a thin sheet of metal with a word scratched into it. Stolas. His name. It was the only thing he could read seeing as it was all he was ever taught. The others refused to teach him, they said it was too dangerous. What danger could he be in just from learning how to read? So many do it and only gain, never lose. He scoffed at their voices. They were just selfish. Though he could not deny that he was too. He withheld many things from man. Secrets, knowledge, treasures, even lives he held in front of them teasingly only to do away with them in the end. He knew many things and took many lives but he feared it was all for nothing. Time seemed to move on too fast and his findings were suddenly old and useless. Shaking the thoughts from his head he pocketed the metal and slipped through a small tunnel he dug behind the crate and up into the night again. Stolas was still hungry so his next stop was someone's kitchen. Shadows moved in sync with his steps but he knew they were there. His friends, his family, a clan of mimics. They made up only few of the many in the world. In their group there was 71 excluding himself. Before he'd come along one had died, a shock considering he had previously posed no threat to anyone else. His mother scratched his name on to the metal and placed him into an offering pile for the mimic leader, shocked to find it raising the baby instead of eating it. She died from starvation not too long after, his father being murdered in an ally. 'Memories will not fill your stomach, imbecile.' One of the shadows taunted. \"I know that, Seere! If you're going to be rude you can stop following me!\" There were no further comments from the black mass. Most windows and doors had been shut and locked tightly and he'd dropped the knife somewhere, though he wasn't sure when. The hunt for food was not going so well. 'I might actually have to eat a bird. Just as I was getting use to the food here!' He thought angrily. Suddenly he could smell it. Bread. He closed his eyes and followed the scent, more coming into the mixture the closer he got. Potatoes, apples, sweet roll, honey, and... cheese? Well, he just won't eat the cheese but everything else smelled amazing. He bumped into an extended piece of wood and opened his eyes. 'No.' He thought to himself. He stood before the open window of a familiar place, one he'd been avoiding. 'No, you can't. He helped you! Taking his property wouldn't be right!' Stolas was about to the leave but his stomach chose that moment to growl and burn in hunger. 'Well, it's only once...' He hopped into the room and threw a quick glance at the bed to the left. The boy that had freed him slept peacefully unaware of the intruder. On the right side of the room was a table of neatly set up foods. A note sat on the table which he look at sadly wishing he knew what it said. He searched his being for something to leave behind for the boy but found he had only one thing; his name. The metal sheet with his name would have to do for now. He left it on the table and ate an apple as he gathered the rest, not the cheese, into his arms and left for home. It took an hour to get everything through the tunnel and into the cellar and he was exhausted when he was finished. Night slowly turned to day and he was sound asleep, dreaming of hunting in the wild with his teeth like a wolf. Memories of life at it's finest moments in the deep forest of Juntin, but those days were gone. He'd have to accept that. The next day was no better. Some people thought so considering only one person had been robbed but one mother and daughter's constant screaming and nagging about their stolen items made it Hell for Eggs. He was considered a noble now and many people went to him to complain. He was the only one who'd listen, or at least try to, didn't mean he could always help. The little girl cried about her stuffed animals and the women nagged about her jewelry. He couldn't help and eventually they left him alone. When he had woken up that morning he was delighted to see that his plan worked. The boy had finally stopped avoiding him and took the food, except Eggs's plan was to wake up and catch him, and he slept through the whole thing. At least he had a clue. A small piece of dirty steel that had Stolas carved crudely into it was left on the table in place of the stolen goods. He had to tell Winnie. Amazingly enough he hadn't seen her at all lately besides at school where they couldn't talk. They were both too busy with other things to chat after and had gone quite a while without contact. This would have to change for at least a moment. Eggs went to her manor and was led inside by a new maid. She said she'd fetch Winnie while he waited by the door. It wasn't too long before the redhead came running down the stars and hugged her friend immediately. \"Eggs! It's been forever!\" She smiled happily and for a minute he'd forgotten why he was there and just wanted to talk and play like they use to, but there were things to be done. \"Winnie, I think I know his name.\" He said as calmly as he could. She looked at him in confusion before her eyes widened in realization. \"Well, don't keep me in suspense, tell me!\" She exclaimed. \"I left food out and my window open so I could maybe catch him but I fell asleep. He took the food though and left something in it's place.\" He took out the metal and showed it to her. \"It says Stolas . I think it's his name. You know when I was thinking about whether I should unlock his door or not he gave me this.\" He pulled the string from around his neck and held up the golden gear hanging on it. \"I'm pretty sure that was a deal. This for freedom.\" Winnie suddenly pulled something out of a pocket on her pink dress. The small silver gear. \"I almost forgot to tell you about this! He took my water and left this. I thought it was a boxtroll because it seemed a little silly, silver for water, but what if he's just leaving whatever he has with him?\" Eggs nodded, that seemed reasonable. \"We have to catch him. I can't do it myself, I'll mess up in some way again. I need your help. If we work together we should be able to do it.\" There was a long pause. \"Okay, but if he turns out to be really dangerous I'm blaming you for whatever he does.\" They shook on it and sealed the deal. They were going to catch Stolas before things got out of hand. Before bed he was too tired to eat anything other than that apple, the first thing he'd eaten in a few days. The citizens assumed he'd been robbing their food when he thought it was obviously the mimics. Half the times he was looking through rooms for neat treasures while they ransacked the kitchens. So what if they left the cheese alone like he did, they were all allergic to cheese! They said the last time he had it when he was a baby he almost died, no way will he be testing that truth. He'd been woken by his stomach's growling, annoyed to see it was still day from the open cellar door and that the old man had confiscated everything he found in the basement, he even had the tunnel plugged. Stolas was in no mood. He was hungry, angry, and a life time of habits and skills were calling for use. Someone had to feed him and he was craving only one thing at the moment. Winnie and Eggs stared in horror and shock at the news headline. DEMON BURGLAR STEALS FRINK'S HEART WHILE HE NAPS Things had officially gotten out of hand. AN: DID THIS TAKE TOO LONG TO GET OUT? I'm sorry, readers D': I didn't actually know when a good time to write this out was and I've been busy. Okay so you'll definitely get a chapter once a week, most likely on the weekend, though it's not evenly planned. It's not like every Saturday or every Sunday, it might even be on a day in the middle of the week. Just one per week. If an entire week and weekend has gone by without a chapter then count me late and let the tomatoes be thrown. So trouble has started! And it's gotten bad! Oh no! Tell me what you guys think of this in the reviews! As always I welcome ANYTHING. GUYS PLEASE AT LEAST ONE MORE REVIEW *dies*[Chapter 4] The curfew was back on and no parents were letting their children out of their house alone. There was fear and anxiety in all the citizens. A twisted murderer was on the loose and no one felt safe. Eggs felt he was the one to blame. He was unaware of Stolas's habits or past life, so how could he possibly think he'd be able to live normally just because he himself could. Stolas was from a different place, raised by different creatures, creatures said to be actually dangerous. \"This is horrible.\" He heard Winnie say next to him. She couldn't believe a child could have done it but one had. Mr. Frink's heart had cut straight out of his chest while he slept. If there was a person who didn't fear the boy before, they all did now. \"I know... I don't understand why he did it but it's clear that he's more dangerous than we thought. Maybe... maybe we shouldn't go after him by ourselves.\" Eggs seemed to shrink. This boy was his responsibility but it was too much for two children to handle. \"I'm going on a walk.\" Eggs got up from the steps of Winnie's house and made his way down the street. For some reason he couldn't think. Too open, too many eyes, too many people trying to get his attention. He instead walked into an empty street and slipped into the sewers, an old familiar place. He could navigate through the whole system with his eyes closed but he only went down there now to think and be alone. It was all the same down there except one thing. He stopped walking when he hit rocks, realizing he'd made his way to another entrance leading into the old boxtroll den. Eggs wish he could go inside but it was all destroyed. With nowhere left to go he turned around. A sudden hiss made him pause. There was nothing around, nothing but him ad some rats but none sounding like that. It sounded like someone was whining now and whimpering. Who was doing that? Were they hurt? He sneaked to the other side of the water and along the wall until he reached a bend. Then someone was throwing up. \" LITTLE FOOL!\" A voice boomed and echoed through the whole underground. Eggs almost yelled in surprise but slapped a hand over his mouth and inched toward the corner in hopes to get a look. \"HOW MANY TIMES MUST I PUNISH YOU BEFORE YOU LEARN TO KEEP THOSE STICKY LITTLE PAWS TO YOURSELF?\" Continued to vomit into the water, panting heavily. Eggs peeked around the corner and his eyes widened. A large mass stood in his way. It was giant with black scales and feathers, a dark fog spilling from it's body. Vaguely human shaped but much more wide. It extended it's arms to whoever it made suffer and cradled it almost fondly. \"STUPID CHILD. YOU KNOW I DO NOT ENJOY THIS BUT YOU MUST LEARN. IF YOU DO NOT LEARN THAN YOU WILL BE AS SAVAGE AS CERTAIN OTHERS AND WE BOTH KNOW THEY HAVE ONLY OBLIVION TO ANSWER TO. SLEEP NOW, MY SON.\" The mass put the being down where Eggs's couldn't see and turned to ash, blowing away in a wind he could not feel. Eggs tiptoed around to see the monster's 'son'. A black blanket covered him all but one limb. An arm. An arm covered in scars like injuries from clawed fingers and a hands with sharp nails. Now though, the nails had dried blood under them and the hands were slightly stained with red. Eggs walked over to the panting form. He cleared his throat as to alert his presence and gain the attention of the other but all it did was make him curl up a little. He was too weak to do it more, unable to even pull his arm in for protection. Eggs frowned. He put his hand on the other's and they started to calm a little. \"You... Are you Stolas?\" Eggs asked hopefully. The boy nodded weakly. There was a distant feeling of fear but it was crushed when he looked at the boy again. 'This boy can't hurt anyone right now, he can barely move!' he told himself. Eggs adjusted himself so he was leaning against the wall. Not knowing what had gotten into him to be so calm he drifted to sleep. AN: Soooo... my laptop broke. Currently using my sister's and decided instead of just leaving a message saying that I'd just pull out a small chapter because I'm really feeling like two people occasionally read this. Seriously does anyone care if I keep doing this? It's meant to be pretty messed up for Stolas so he's not a happy character at all. Also with the mimic making him sick he kinda sounds like a Dremora Lord. Seriously love their voices so I thought the more serious mimic would have one of those. And yes they are always LOUD when not speaking into your mind so imagine accidental yelling. Don't know when I'll be back on soooooo yeah... until next time o3o ","Summary":" Everyone could only celebrate.

Part 1 \" There is no despair so absolute as that which comes with our first great sorrow. Before we know what it is to have loved and lost, to despaired and have recovered hope.\" ― George Elliot o Chapter 1 She had been thirteen years old when Johnny Quid had died. Well… now - about nine or something years later - she should probably say 'when Johnny Quid died for the first time' , but that was the problem: he had died once and only that time for her. After that, she hadn't hurt as much. It wasn't nice to say that, and maybe that made her callous, but after that first time, she had lost the ability to be surprised by anything he did – death included. Johnny Quid – that became the joke in some circles she ran in, but Lisa had never, not once, found it funny. But it had never been quite like that first time, and that was the pure truth. Possibly because she had been so young then. She had never known any kind of sorrow, or fear or loss. She had lived a very sheltered life, in many ways she was still a child. So when she found him that fateful night, looking grey and cold to the touch… there had been no means in her to deal or even understand the absolute despair she felt. Lisa had known that he did drugs - he and his friends talked about it often enough and she knew enough about the argument never to repeat a word of what she heard to another living soul - but in her mind she had not been able to truly dissect what that meant. She didn't have the means to understand the harsh reality of it beyond a group of teenagers laughing all over the Persian carpets of her living room. The only thing that Lisa shared with Johnny Quid's world was the name of their school and her sister, who played in his band. Jocelyn Wilbur, a.k.a. Will to for her friends. (Cee to her sister alone) was a guitarists and she played with Johnny and three other boys in their band. They practiced in her house's basement, and had parties and even though Lisa was almost five years younger than both her sister and Johnny, she still hung in the fringes of their life – and Cee let her, because she could see how much Lisa adored it. It was just so much fun, even though all Lisa did was just sit there with a camera of a sketchbook and look at them. They were so glamorous in her eyes, so impossibly free and cool and alive. rock&roll; with a side dish of danger, because being around them always felt just a little bit wrong, as if she was doing something she shouldn't be doing… and Lisa loved it. There were four boys in Cee's band, but Lisa liked Johnny best of all. Mostly because she had known him every since she could remember, seeing that Cee was the closest thing he had to a best friend. And also because… well, it was silly and stupid and Lisa would never admit it to a living soul… but she had a crush on him. And why not - he had the sweetest smile and always made her laugh and never talked to her like she was a retarded five year old. He was the only one in her sister's band that actually talked to her period – the other doofus' looked at her like she was a pet or something. Johnny knew better, and Lisa adored him for it. She remembered this one time when they had all been sitting in the kitchen eating and talking about their next gig, when – without warning or any obvious motive - Johnny had grabbed Lisa and thrown her over his shoulder kicking ad screaming and then run all over the house with the others chasing him and Lisa laughing and Cee staring after him in irritation, rolling her eyes. One particularly loud 'if you get her hurt I'll rip your spleen through your back Johnny' followed after them and Lisa felt like smiling. She had been thrown in the pool and the four boys came crashing down after her, laughing and howling like wolves. That had been a fund day. There were not-so-much-fun days as well, but Lisa had only ever had glimpses of those, which was perhaps why she had no understanding of what drugs really did to you – or Johnny, as was the case. But Cee didn't feel the need to educate her baby sister on that particular subject. Years later Lisa had understood that her sister was trying to protect her and she acknowledged that, had she been in Cee's place, Lisa would have probably done the same thing… but sometimes she couldn't help but wanting to have had some kind of warning. But Cee didn't keep her around when Johnny was all glares and sneers and filthy words and short-temper. Cee knew that Lisa loved having Johnny around (the more the merrier was her little sister's philosophy, something Cee suspected was because she missed her parents, who were almost never around anymore.) They were both used to him, he had his own room and everything, seeing that every now and then he took a vacation from his house and came to stay over, sometimes for weeks (god knew Cee understood!). But though Lisa cared for Johnny like she would for a big brother, she was just a kid still and she wouldn't understand it if he snapped at her seemingly without motive, and Cee had enough presence of mind not to keep her around when he got like that. Something else Lisa never really understood back then was the true nature of that gleam in Johnny's eyes sometimes. She never really comprehended that it was not quite like her own, not happiness or laughter. never caught the particular manic signs in his behavior sometimes. Cocaine will do that to you... but Lisa had been barely thirteen, she didn't really know all that. Not yet anyway. She found out exactly what that mean on Cee's class graduation party. And she could never quite forget it.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 The after-party - or something like that - was in their house and Lisa was not supposed to have been there but her there had been some trouble that she didn't know (all she had heard was Cee screaming on the phone and then declaring someone was fired), so she ended up being staying at the house anyway. She could hear Cee's band playing from three floors up and Johnny singing. She liked to hear him sing. Most of their songs were angry and fast and screaming and heavy, but there were some nicer ones, some slower ones… and some really sad ones as well. She liked them all. And tonight, they were really going at it. They were happy, Lisa supposed. Both Johnny and her sister had just graduated today. Cee was accepted at Cambridge, she was starting next semester, and was happy about it. Was Johnny happy too? He never talked about school, all he wanted to do was sing. He was going to do that and he already had a manager and a whole lot of things that Lisa didn't really understand because he had been talking so fast, but it sounded like he had been excited about it. 'Are you going to invite me to your concerts when you're famous?' 'Sure thing Bit. You'll be my number one fan.' 'Yeah.' They'd just had that conversation some hours ago before she went to bed and even though his eyes were s dark and he looked so tired and almost sick, he had smiled at her anyway. When Lisa had asked him if he wanted to sleep a while, he had laughed, but it hadn't sounded like he was amused at all. It didn't take a genius to know something was wrong with him, and Lisa was a smart girl after all. But there were so many other things she didn't know. oooooo It was almost three a.m. when she woke with a start. She'd had another nightmare and she was on the verge of tears already, but the sounds of the music coming from downstairs were bringing her back to her own room and away from clawing monsters with red noses and colorful hair. She really hated clowns! Lisa sniffed and got up to go to the bathroom. She remembered the rules: no going down when big sis is having a party. She knew why the rules were there too. Some of her sisters friends were nice and fun and smiled pretty, like Johnny. And others were not so nice and really rude. So she kept to the rules, because she didn't really want to meet anybody right now. She just wanted to go to the loo and... Lisa stopped, her hand froze over the light switch that she had just turned on. The glare of the harsh light made spots dance in front of her eyes so it took her some moments to adjust her vision, but that impression of someone's arm reaching just outside the tub had not been her imagination. It was real... and it was right there, limp and boneless as if he was asleep. Except he wasn't. \"J-Johnny?\" Her voice came in a whisper. She hadn't ever seen anyone looking like he was looking, but it didn't take experience to know that something was terribly wrong with him. He was almost grey, his eyes sunken and dark in their sockets, skin stretched tightly over his bones, his mouth just a little parted, eyes not entirely closed so that a sliver of white showed in the most horrifying way. A whisper in her chest told her something terrifying, and it was the particular lick of bone chilling terror that that whisper inspired that spurned her into moving. Lisa stepped towards him and reached a shaking hand forward, but didn't have enough courage to touch him. She had wanted to shake him awake... but what if he wasn't just sleeping? What if he... \"Wake up Johnny.\" Please wake up... But he didn't move a single muscle. Was he ever breathing? He had to be breathing. So she spoke louder. \" Johnny .\" Her voice didn't tremble so badly this second time. And when he still didn't move, her fear of him being not-asleep won over the fear of anything else. Because if there was any chance that he would wake up if she shook him, it would be worth it. It would be worth the horror she felt in her small body at the thought of touching someone that didn't breathe anymore. She caught him by the hand... He was so cold she whimpered at the contact, and heavy tears fell, making her sight blurry. But she could still see him. It was as if her mind had burned the sight of him behind her eyelids. She'd seen plenty of movies. Nothing had felt this bloodcurdling, not a thing. Nothing had been so real before. Or hurt this much. Or been so terrifying that her stomach was touching the floor and she felt her heart in her throat beating a mile a minute. She squeezed his hand tightly, caught his wrist with her other hand and shook hard, as hard as she could. \"Come on, wake up. You need to move, I have to use the loo Johnny.\" It sounded so stupid. But she didn't know what to say. What could you say to someone who was so obviously not going to say anything ever again. \"Please... please...\" And by now she was begging and crying in earnest because the panic was over and he wasn't moving still and she was still touching and it didn't feel terrifying anymore, it just hurt. So bad she could hardly breathe for the strength of it. Nothing had hurt this much, she felt like she was about to be sick. She sobbed hard, rubbed her eyes with her hand to wipe the tears away, but they would stop. A sound from outside caught her attention. She shook as if someone had screamed at her, and then all the sounds around her came back all at once and Lisa remembered that she was not alone in the house, there were so many people downstairs. Cee was downstairs. Cee would know what to do. So Lisa ran. She ran down the stairs for three flights and almost tripped a couple of times but didn't stop. There were people lying on the couches, on the floor, there were bottles and cups and laughter and so much noise and even though Lisa screamed it felt as if nobody heard her. Not until she caught sight of Flash - the drummer with the hair of such a bright shade of blue that it was impossible to miss him. Lisa ran to him. \"Flash, where is Cee?\" she sounded so anxious, and she was crying and even though she was so clearly distressed, all the eighteen year old and the unfamiliar girls and boys around him did was laugh at the sight of her and her disheveled hair. \"She's around 'ere somewhere.\" he said flippantly. \"What's got you so riled up then? You had a bad dream?\" His pout was mocking, but instead of blushing, Lisa frowned. After all, her sister was not the only one with the steel backbone in the family... And her sister was not the one who found Johnny Quid in her bathroom, cold and grey and not breathing. \"Tell me where my sister is, blue-boy.\" She said, and this time it was an order spoken in a tone that made her sound much more like her sister usually sounded. And because Blue-boy was what Johnny always called him and Lisa had always had the impression that Flash didn't like it. She wasn't even thinking that at the moment, the name just came to her. \"Oooh, kitten got claws...\" was his response, and everyone around them laughed – but help was on the way, even though Lisa didn't know it. \"Shut it Flash, or I'll tear you a new one. What's going on here?\" At the sound of her sisters harsh voice, Lisa could almost have cried all over again. She turned and saw the contours of displeasure on her sisters face as she spotted her. And just as Cee was about to open her mouth to demand what the hell Lisa was doing down (in her orange nightgown complete with bunnies-print no less!), she caught the look on her little sister face, the tears in her eyes and the paleness of her skin and that was all it took for the irritation to evaporate. Worry had her kneeling and putting her hands on Lisa's shoulders. \"What's the matter, what's wong?\" And the question spurred her into even heavier sobs and faster tears. \"Johnny is upstairs. In… in the bathroom... He's n-not moving, he is… Cee…\" Lisa had never stuttered a day in her life, but she was stuttering now and Cee had a momentary flush of panic. If that blithering idiot had gone and ODed on her little sister bathroom, Cee was gonna raise the fucker from the grave just os she could kill him again. Johnny fucking Quid, what the fuck have you done now. But throughout all of this, she had already send Lisa away with Miss Jonson to the back of the house. Tea was in order, a strong one to make Lisa sleep without trouble, and as she gave this instruction, she shouted for everybody to get the fuck out of her house while she dialed for the ambulance, hoping against hope and with trembling hands that Johnny would really die, because come on, he couldn't . Every rock legend that was worth it had made it to at least twenty something before snuffing it. For Lisa on the other hand, the rest of the night was a blur. She watched the ambulance stop in front of her house, people come in and Johnny come out on a stretcher. The next day she overheard her sister saying on the phone that he had died on the way to the hospital. She cried for a whole day and the one after that, before anyone bothered to tell her that yes, Johnny had died for a few minutes, but he had gotten over it right quick, because the doctors had brought him back. Johnny didn't come around the house on more after that. And not only did Lisa never see him there, but if she wanted to see him at all she had to buy a ticket like everyone else and go to his shows… and though she did go, she never got tot talk to him. Cee went away to uni and Lisa knew that she did meet with him sometimes, but not once did her sister offer to take her along, not even when Lisa asked her to. Once or twice she thought he caught her eye in one of his shows… but he never spoke to her again. Not once, in years. And once she grew up, because she never saw him she slowly grew out of her crush for him. but the fondness she had for him stayed, because more than anything he had been familiar in the way people you care about are, in the way those really close to you can be. And that old part of her that remained a child and clung to old affections twitched inside her heart every time she read in the papers about something outrageous he had done or had been done to him. Strange how human emotions works. You grown and change and leave pieces of yourself behind all the time as you take on new some things stay with you for better or worse, because they remain the only part of something dear you once had and then lost. Like a favorite doll, or an old memory, or a childhood friend. AN: Sooo... what's the verdidt? am i being too much of a tearjerker? I know i tend towards that, and in the next one, which is gonna be from Johnny's pov, Im gonna try to be a little more bare when i write, to fit it to his character.[Chapter 3] AN: Ok, here is sober Johnny. I did lots of research to write this acurately, and i hope that any one of you who has has experience with these things is not too harsh on me for things i didn't get right, or exagerated, or downplayed. If so, or if i offend anyone in any way, i hope you forgive me, it was unintentional. Hope you like. Let me know. o Chapter 3 It was something else, being sober. Being completely clean. At first it had felt almost like a new kind of high, being able to slice and dissect your thoughts without any background fuzzies, without anything running interference, being able to look at the world though clean eyes. it all felt like being born again. After so many years of always tampering with his own body's chemical reactions, being free of anything foreign in it was foreign in itself. Withdrawals had not been fun. It had felt like walking through hell to come back to something that everyone seemed to call normal, something he didn't even really remember anymore. Good thing he had been locked in a hole during that. Most of the time, he had forgotten why he'd been doing it. Why he was hurting this bad. His mind and body had been screaming at him while he had been plain screaming… but even though he didn't even remember the reason for what he was going through during the worst of his crises, there was something in him, something in his head that kept hammering on that this had to be done. the reason didn't matter, the perseverance to continue was what made the difference, and Johnny was nothing if not a stubborn bastard. And now that it had been done and the oppressive feeling of being a slave to every imaginable substance he had ever abused was gone, he was able to finally feel himself without anything extra adding a compulsive little voice inside his head. At first it almost felt like he was feeling everything more keenly, as if for the first time in years he had complete equilibrium and peace with his senses. As if he could even feel the flame of his own should in his chest, burning brighter…. but that was just the too much poetry he had consumed in his life. Either way, it felt phenomenal: the simple happiness of being alive, having a choice over what you do, that jolt of joy you feel at being out of where you came from. It felt like nothing else had ever felt before and it was fantastic… which could be dangerous if you didn't show some care. They warned him about that. Warned him that simply being clean didn't mean staying clean. That that feeling of being on your own in your body was powerful and that you had to learn to control it. The lure of going back into nightmares would get stronger once the high of finally being clean faded, because in the back of your mind you'd know that this newborn feeling of being more alive than ever came after. Being clean could easily become part of the whole addiction circle, a new kind of drug. Perverse really how easily you could slip back into an old habit. But there was something about Johnny that the therapists in his clinic noticed right away. There were plenty of problems that the young rocker needed to sort out, but weakness of will was not one of them. On the contrary, Mr. Quid, his philologist observed, demonstrates a perseverance that is quite a novelty and an ability to take into structured part of his rehabilitation in a way that should point to good chances for his recovery. What that mean in a practical sense was that he had to take it nice and slow for a while. Insert himself in the world of the living little by little, not to expose himself to too much too soon. Not to forget the filth he left behind, because soon the pink cloud of newfound soberness would fade, he'd start living again and maybe he'd forget how bad it was before and fall back. But Johnny hadn't. It had been a year and a half now and his only poison were death-sticks and coffee. He went to meetings, kept up with his 'parole officer', went to his shrink even though the guy was a bloody pain in the arse. For the first time in his life he did everything right because another thing about Johnny was that he never forgot anything. He was one of those people that could still remember what it felt like to watch yourself decay and fall into a shadow. He remembered now, with excruciating detail, what it felt like to say, 'i have no control over my life' and just take your hands off the steering wheel and let it all go to shit in exactly that way. he remembered so clearly because for eh first time in quite a long time, he was able to look back and see it. All of it. ...and besides, there was no reason to try to block it out anymore. Nothing to escape from, nobody to hate that way anymore - or dread that way. His reasons for wanting tear away through haze and mayhem and wrap himself in electric guitar sounds so loud you couldn't hear yourself think was now six feet under. Had been for a while too. All was just fine. Or at least getting there. ","Summary":" AN: I just saw RocknRolla for the first time and i realized that if i didn't write this down, it wo"},{"Movie":"RocknRolla","Title":"My Little RocknRolla","Author":"bandits pesty uncle","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10171114","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"She will always be my fa-vorite line. I sing about her all- the time...\" In my seat beside Archy at the side of the tennis courts I sing an old and fantastic tune. I don't focus on the man who sings it and the pain even just his name brings up and instead focus on a much more entertaining sight. Beyond my blue eyes and black sunglasses is the Councilor running around like a chicken without a head. It was a pathetic sight but father wouldn't let me voice my opinions. He needed me to be his darling little secret weapon-beautiful on the outside and genius on the inside. I was the perfect combination of beauty, brains, and brawn...said father. I feel no worry that Archy will ask what I am humming; in fact, I'm more than certain he already knows. The thing about Archy and I is that we have always had an understanding. We didn't have to talk because we just understood certain things-one of which is don't interrupt me when I'm humming and don't interrupt him when he's reading the paper. Between his hands is today's news and I don't blame him for wanting to distract himself from the annoying schmoozing we have to do with this guy; I wish I could too. There is an odd take in of breath and I turn to Archy, brows furrowed around my blue eyes, \"Archy, what's wrong?\" \"I've got something I think you and your father should see,\" he states simply. I turn slightly in my chair and narrow my eyes on Father at the bar-God, he was getting so old. I wave him toward us and watch him roll his eyes as he gets to his feet. So, so old and nasty. \"What's wrong now, Maddy?\" His voice is soft as he makes it to us and I can't help but feel a slight sting of hatred. He hadn't started using that tone with me until I was eighteen and could be used as a bargaining chip. \"Uncle Arch, has something he needs to show us,\" I explain, turning back around so I can look at the only real paternal care I've ever had. \"What is it, Arch?\" Father questions, placing his hands on the back of Archy's chair. \"Read here,\" instructs Archy, as he motions to a particular article. Father takes in the same odd breath before he reads, \"Johnny Quid, singer extraordinare, fell off a boat, missing, assumed dead.\" \"Well, I don't know what to say Len. Madeline,\"Arch's voice is a soft whisper I couldn't quite hear anymore. Now I wasn't listening. Now I was remembering. Ten Years Ago... \"Get out of this house and never come back! You crack head!\" \"I'd rather be a crack head than a lying fucking rat!\" \"Come here you little pie-!\" The front door boomed to a close and vibrated through out the entire house, through out my entirety of bones. I shoved the covers off of me and sprinted after him. I ran past father and past his cold words. I ran outside and slammed the door behind me, just as he had done before me, to Johnny there with his bag, waiting for me. The bags fell with a crunch onto the ground when his eyes landed on me and he ran to meet me half way. He lifted me into his arms and kissed me lovely and when he pulled away my breath was gone from me. I dropped my head onto his shoulder as I cried silently. I held tight, trying to crush him into me so he can hide and never have to leave. So he would never have to leave me. \"Madeline...,\" his lips pressed against my ear and I shivered, my own body threatening to cave in. He held me back just as tight as he took a fist full of my hair and pressing it against my skull. \"Don't go, Johnny. Don't leave me here all alone,\" my words were pitiful as I pressed my lips against his neck and begged, \"Please!\" \"Maddy...I. I have to go,\" he whispered. Tears poured from my face in such a way I couldn't understand. The only thing I knew was that I couldn't stay quiet anymore, \"Why? Just go and...and tell him you'll stop. Just go to rehab and we'll be together! We'll be together!\" \"I can't...\" he was shaking his head as he said these words. His fingers caressing my face and cascading through my hair, \"Not this time. This time is different. There is no going back now.\" \"But why?\" I cried. \"Why can't we go back to how it was?...Johnny I-I love you.\" He pulled away so he could smile his flying smile then brought me back in for another embrace. I felt him take in a deep breath of my hair as he whispered against the top of my head, \"You will always be my favorite Line.\" I shook my head and sadly wrapped my arms around him as I dug my face into his chest. I continued to cry because there was no winning when he was like this. There was nothing when he was like this. I protested, \"You'll die out there...alone...\" \"I'm not alone,\" he said with a hopeful, far away tone, \"I got you...\" \"Not when you're like this. Not when you're out there!\" I snapped. I took in a deep breath of him because I could feel him slipping away. He smelled like the rainforest in a sunny day. He smelled like freedom and life-he smelled like my love. I heard the crunching of gravel beneath wheels as a car pulled up. The horn confirmed my worst suspicion. He pulled away with that terrible smile, \"That's for me. I'll see you...later.\" He released me so he could grasp his bags once more. As he walked away I knew what that meant. That meant months on end /waiting/. Waiting for a call from the police. Waiting to see his face and name in the obituary. Waiting and wishing for death. I just couldn't do that anymore. \"No!\" The word exploded out of me like a shot from a canon. He seemed to freeze into place and like a puppet on a string turn. The haze was slowly descending as he grasped my words, \"What? No what?\" \"No, I can't sit and wait for 'later!' For an 'I love you too' that will never come! I can't wait for you to never get clean and to never come back!\" I shouted with no care of who was listening, \"...If you're not here tomorrow...don't bother ever returning.\" My Johnny was replaced by a silent and emotionless being. As if I had not even spoken he opened the car door and dropped his bags inside. I thought I would die right then but once his hands were free he turned around and walked right to me. He placed his hands on either side of my face and kissed me as gently as he did the first time. With his lips on mine I foolishly thought he would belong to me forever. But I should have known Johnny could never belong to anyone. I would have kept my eyes shut as he disappeared from me but I always wanted to stare death in the face, especially my own. Without another word he got into the car and shut the door behind him. As he drove away in that strangers car I grew years beyond my own age. I had been a child-done childish things and thought childish ways-but that was no more. Without blinking, without breathing, I watched the love of my life leave and realized there was no such thing as love at all. My father had been right all along. I didn't cry and I didn't feel as Johnny drove away. I didn't cry and I didn't feel when he never came back. Now... \"I-I have to go...\" is all I can say as I stand from my seat and grab my things. \"Now where are you going?\" Father's voice is just as harsh as it always is in my times of weakness. \"I forgot I had to meet Matthew,\" I mumble, not looking to Archy or Father though my eyes are well hidden behind my sunglasses, \"Meet you back home, yeah.\" He nods, \"Alright then.\" \"Bye, Arch,\" my voice is hardly audible as I walk away from the only eyes that can see what is happening to me. In an all-knowing voice he calls after me, \"Bye, Mad.\" I leave the premises in a haze of cracking emotion. I hadn't felt anything in such a long time I feel like I'm going to shatter. I throw my things in the back seat and reach under my seat to find my secret cd case. I open it and feel my eyes watering as my fingers touch his face on the stupid cd covers. He had been declared dead by the media plenty of times before but I only ever heard about it after and never from Archy and never from the respectable paper he reads. This is different. This is real. Though my eyes water I don't quite cry yet. I can't bring myself to do it. I can't realize the hurricane growing inside of me just yet. I turn to his first CD, my favorite, and touch his young face on the cover. The title was 'My Favorite Line.' It was about me. I put the CD in my stereo and shake as his voice fills my car. \"She will always be my fa-vorite line. I sing about her all- the time.\" My hand clutches my chest as I throw myself back into my seat. Johnny is gone. He's really gone this time. And he's never coming back.[Chapter 2] When I reach the cafe my pain is buried as deep as I can manage. I know Matthew is waiting inside and I know my father must have called him. Since he joined my father's crew five years ago my dad has been trying to get us together and it isn't until last year that I decided to listen. Matthew has always been handsome but there has always been something about him I didn't like and didn't understand. The worst part is on paper he's perfect but everything about him feels like a lie. He talks to my dad more than he talks to me, he flirts harmlessly when ever I'm not around, he tells me he loves me and asks me to talk about everything all the time. Our love just feels like a phony. I park the car in front of the cafe and eject the cd. I slip it back in its place and shove the case under my seat. My fingers caress the face once more of the man I have lost more times than I can count. I take in a deep breath and hide the case under my seat just like I hide everything still touched by him; still untouched by anyone else. I leave my car with the same expression I have used my whole life. No one knows what's inside but they know who's daughter I am so I don't even bother locking the doors after I shut mine. I walk into the cafe and easily see my bright blonde boyfriend at a table flirting with the waitress. Normally I would walk away and wait for him to run after me but today I am in no mood. Any other day I would adore my own company but I need to forget about Johnny. I need to remind myself of what I've been trying to forget-he is not apart of my life anymore. I walk to the table and take my seat across from him. My hands move to my brown hair to push it out of my face as I order, \"Coffee...Black.\" I didn't look at her but I could tell she was looking at me. I knew she was about to confront me until one of her friends call over. I can see the waitress' eyes when she realizes who I am but that's not what I want. I don't want my father's name today. Matthew's own blue eyes are tinted with guilt, \"I-I was just talking to her it wa-\" \"I don't care,\" I answer honestly, glancing down at the newspaper in front of him. The picture of Johnny breaks my heart all over again. I can't help but to think if I had looked for him. Maybe if I had found him. If I had done something he would still be alive. \"Oh, Maddy,\" it's as if he realizes just then what I had been looking at. He takes my hands as he sighs, \"This must be hard for you.\" \"I'm fine,\" I mumble, pulling my hands away. Matthew could never imagine how hard this is for me. To him Johnny had only ever been my stepbrother. To him I only ever loved him like a real brother. To him Johnny was just a crackhead RocknRolla. And to me...to me Johnny was still that boy that left me on the lawn all those years ago. But the truth was no one knows who he is. Not anymore. The waitress returns with my coffee and a Danish I didn't order. I place my hands around the cup and begin to drink it slowly. I didn't realize how cold I am until the warm liquid begins to fill me. I'm cold. Johnny is dead. I don't know why it's affecting me so much. I hadn't seen him since that one night. I hadn't thought of him since the last time a cd came out, just last year. \"Okay,\" he sighs with a 'comforting' smile on his lips, \"Tonight I am all your's. I'll call Mr. Cole and let him know I can't make it tonight. I'll be busy taking care of you. It'll be just us, in the moonlight, all alon-\" \"Johnny's death is not going to get you layed,\" I snap angrily. Matthew is silent and I realize what I said may not have been the proper thing to do. Because of my father I never could hang with the boys as most girls could and because of my own heartlessness I could never settle with a man I thought good enough to rock his world. Because of this I am still a virgin but that doesn't mean I have been positively pure. My actions in the bed room have always been for my pleasure only have always dominated whom ever I shared space with. Because of this fact...I know my words were too harsh. \"I-I'm so sorry,\" I say as I reach over to take his hand. I always liked how big and rough they were, as if they have seen many face and demolished them all. \"Matthew, I didn't mean it.\" \"You don't have to explain yourself,\" he shakes his head as he gives a light squeeze to my hand, \"I'll just say my peace and that's all. No more mention of this. I just think you shouldn't take this so hard. From what I understand John was a bum, a no good crackhead that didn't deserve the life he had. We're all better off with him dead. We don't need anymore shitheads taking our oxygen.\" He doesn't notice when I pull my hands away in disgust because he's already picking at my danish. How could he be so cruel? For almost an entire year we had been together and he was never like this. Sure he flirted with the girls and talked to my father more than he talked to me. Sure the only reason I gave him a shot was through my father's order. But he was never this cruel. \"Maddy, we can do whatever you want today. I am all your's,\" he smiles. He takes my hand again and whispers, \"I love you.\" Those words had been thrown between us often but now. Now I couldn't let the words leave my throat. I just can't say anything back. His words sound so false. Did they always sound untrue? Or was Johnny's death tainting everything? \"Maddy?\" Matthew suddenly takes my hand in a grip I had never felt before. His eyes are so blue and pleading as he begs, \"Maddy, no. Don't go.\" \"I have something I need to finish,\" I lie as I snatch my hand away, \"Something my father told me to do that I just remembered.\" Matthew backs off at the mention of my father and I know I am free. In last ditch effort he asks, \"Do you need any company?\" \"Do I ever need company?\" is my honest reply. He smiles, \"You're right. Are we still on for tonight?\" I shrug, \"Why not?\" I walk away from that man and out of the cafe that had only succeeded in reminding me of everything I had lost. I get into my car and decide to drive away. I need to clear my mind of the falseness that has always surrounded me. I need to be around people that are always true and always honest. I need to see the Wild Bunch.[Chapter 3] Fifteen years ago... \"Why do we have to move, Daddy?\" My question had come in a quiet voice because I had learned at an early age how to speak to him, \"It's my birthday. You said when I turn ten we can go to the zo-\" \"That's enough,\" Father had snapped as we pulled up in front of our new home. My mouth turned into a tight line of protest as I gazed at the new place. It had been bigger than our old home but then again I had been used to big houses with empty rooms all my life. My eyes narrowed as the faces of the people in front become clear. I felt a small smile form on my lips as I made out one of the faces: Uncle Archy. Father's voice became clear once more to ruin what ever joy I had begun to feel, \"You will be on your best behavior from now on and you will call Marianne 'Mother.' You got that?\" \"She isn't my mother,\" I had muttered under my breath. A slap I hadn't been prepared for came to my face as Father corrected me, \"She's the only 'Mother' that wants you. Now you do as I say or I'll throw you in the mad house.\" I wiped at the single tear that fell from my face as the driver got out of the car. I sniffed weakly as I looked out the window, \"Okay. Let's go see Mother.\" In truth I wasn't okay and I didn't want a new mother but I couldn't take another second in that car anymore. As soon as the door opened I was out and running to Archy. When I got just before him I paused but he gave me his old fashioned smile, \"Come on here, Mad. Give us a cuddle.\" I could never stay upset for too long in front of him. I threw myself into his arms and he hugged me the way my own father never seemed to be able to. I looked up at him and hoped he would listen to my pleas, \"Uncle Archy, will you be staying with us today? Can you take me to the zoo like last year?\" \"Archy and I got better things to do today,\" it was father's voice, ruining something good again. I stepped back from Archy's hug to see the serious expression on his face, \"Now go inside. They're waiting for you.\" \"'They'?\" I repeated in confusion. \"You haven't told her?\" Archy asked, turning to father with a look of...disappointment? \"I told her what she needed to know,\" father huffed. Archy placed his hand on my shoulder and spoke with an excessive cheeriness, \"You have a brother now. His name's Johnny. He's a nice boy so /don't/ be /rude/.\" I felt like a deer in headlights. How could he not tell me something so important? How could he not tell me? All I can do is nod, \"Okay.\" \"We don't have all day. Let's go,\" Father rushed, pushing me ahead. I stumble slightly but catch my footing and begin to walk. I ignore the scary man and look to my only friend, \"See you, Arch.\" \"See you, Mad,\" he gave me a wink. I walked through the doors alone but I had been used to that for a while. My eyes jumped from place to place in silent observing. This place was big like our old one and I felt just as lonely. I was sure a new mother and brother couldn't change that. Since the death of my mother I was one hundred percent certain. \"Madeline?\" My eyes looked up to see the most beautiful woman in the world standing before me. She was tall and lovely like an angel. Her hair was long and brown and flowed like a model's. Her skin was beautiful and she had the prettiest, prettiest brown eyes. The dress she wore was white and amazing and I just couldn't believe she could like someone like my dad. \"Why, you are such a beautiful little girl,\" her voice filled up the air and her smile filled up my heart. She looked to the side as she nodded, \"Isn't she, Johnny?\" My eyes followed her's but when they did I regretted it. I couldn't take seeing such beautiful people together at once. He was so handsome he didn't seem real. He had the same brown hair, the same nice skin, the same pretty and shinning brown eyes. I couldn't believe this was my new family. Mother tapped his shoulder and his only response was a shrug. She gave a truly amused laugh before smiling at me once more, \"You're wearing a wonderful little dress. I hear today is your birthday. How old are you?\" \"Ten,\" I answered in the quiet voice I always used. Her eyes widened with joy, \"Johnny is ten as well. Why don't you both go upstairs and play in Johnny's room while I order us some lunch. Then when you're father is done with his business we can have ourselves a nice birthday dinner. Would you like that?\" I tried my hardest to smile but it was actually pretty easy as I nodded. She gently pushed Johnny forward and he smiled at her and then turned his smile to me. He stepped forward as he said, \"Follow me.\" My steps behind him were slow and nervous because it was a new house and yet it seemed like he had lived there forever. It was all big hallways and big rooms on quiet floors and if it weren't for Johnny I would be afraid. I supposed it would be okay, a big house for two growing children. Especially one as handsome as he that promised to grow bigger. Everything might be okay with a friend in the house. When we eventually had gotten to his room I stayed still at the door. Boxes lined the room and yet it still felt like his. There was a pause, as if he was expecting me to do something and then there was a flicker of understanding in his eyes. He looked around, almost frantically, until he came across a chair lined with boxes. He removed them and then motioned toward it, \"You can sit here.\" I gave a brief nod thanks as I moved to sit on the now open seat. It seemed he didn't see my nod because he found interest in looking for something in the boxes so I said vocally, \"Thank you.\" He gave another shrug as he replied, \"No problem. Do you like music?\" The question had been odd but I looked down to answer, \"Father doesn't really like music. He doesn't let me listen to the radio so I don't know much about it.\" \"Oh, I have to fix that,\" he said with a wicked grin. From the box he pulled a tape and ordered, \"Listen to this. It will change your life.\" With interest I watched him walk to his cassette player and put the tape in, \"What is it? Bach? Mozart? Beethoven?\" His face was adorned with a smug expression,\"Even better. Hendrix. Now close your eyes and see with your ears.\" \"With my ears?\" I repeated. \"Yup. If you can hear with your mouth,\" he added. It was odd to have the smile on my face, the first I could remember that wasn't false or created by Uncle Archy. I followed his instructions and shut my eyes as the music began to play. It was wild and passionate and loud and happy and it filled me up and shook me hard. I had never heard anything like it, I knew instantly it was bad. I had been about to tell him to shut it off but then he began to sing. His voice was like a new world, beautiful but weird because he was a boy singing a man's words. I didn't quite mind it then and I certainly didn't want him to shut it off. I wondered if that's what love felt like-something bad you just can't bring to end. \"Turn that racket down!\" Father's voice was quiet but it shouted through me. I was frozen in terror with each word he spoke, \"Madeline, what are you doing in here? And turn that shit off already!\" The music went silent but suddenly Johnny's voice was heard to defend me, \"It's not her fault. My mom said we could play.\" He took in an angry breath and extended his finger to point between both of us, \"Well, you listen to me now. You stay away from my daughter you stupid little ba-\" \"Daddy,\" I interrupted, \"Why are you being so mean?\" The smack came again to burn the cheek that had already been in so much pain. My eyes opened and to my surprise I watched Johnny run to him and push him. I couldn't believe my eyes until Johnny got his own smack and father hissed, \"Now you both listen to me. I will beat you both and send you to boarding school if I catch you together again. You hear me?\" I held onto my cheek and simply nodded my head in response. \"Now get up and clean yourselves up,\" he demanded, grabbing me up by my elbow when I didn't move fast enough. He motioned to Johnny, \"And you get your ass downstairs to help your mother, she's feeling ill again.\" I was back to my miserable world until I heard Johnny's gentle voice, saying, \"Bye, Madeline.\" I turned around to reply but father yanked me away too hard so all he saw was my smile. I hoped that was enough for him to know how sorry I was he joined this life of mine. I hoped it was enough for him to know how thankful I was to not be in it alone. Now... Since the first time I met him Johnny was changing my life and even now he's mixing everything up from beyond the stupid grave. In my car I try to calm the pounding inside of my chest. I try to wait for my eyes to clear from the haze of unfalling moisture. I have to get over this or it will kill me but how can I get over someone I never truly mourned. How can I put to rest someone I never truly accepted was gone?[Chapter 4] With my head spinning I walk on shaking ground to the only place I can really be myself and really have fun. I had been ordered by Father to sit on it for a little while but being the young girl I am I ditched to hang out with some friends. I got in some trouble and the good hearted men of the Wild Bunch saved me and brought me back to the Speeler that was when I met the colorful group and was allowed to stay-as long as I didn't mention any business to my father. Not that I want to brag but when I've got a set of cards in my hand I can't keep money out of my pocket. My finger presses the buzzer in my usual way by holding it down until I get an answer. Fred the Head's voice comes on the other end,\"Who the fuck is it?\" \"It's Maddy,\" I answer, unable to hide my smile. \"Are we in trouble?\" he asks. \"That depends,\" I can't help but to smirk, \"did you do anything wrong?\" The buzzer sounds and I laugh to myself. Everyone in that place was guilty. I walk down the steps and into the Speeler where all the usual suspects wait. Mumbles, always quick to greet, winks toward me, \"Don't you get tired of taking our money?\" \"Don't you get tired of losing it?\" I retaliate. I ignore the blush his wink produces as I look to Fred, \"Deal me in.\" He nods,\"Righto, Maddy.\" I take the seat between my Handsome and Mumbles but I cannot look at anyone but Bob, \"How are you?\" He gives me a brief shrug as he looks down at his cards. I had heard through the grape vine he just got pinned on a drug charge. Five years of Handsome Bob's life going down the drain because of some sneaky fucking rat. No one knows who the rat is and for a while I didn't quite care until Arch got pinched. Four years he was gone..that place turned his famous grin into merely a smile. I couldn't imagine what that place would do to a soft golden boy like Handsome. \"You'll be okay,\" I smile, reaching my hand to grip onto his shoulder gently. He gives me his nice smile that is as polite as it is sad,\"You are something sweet, Maddy.\" \"Oh, Ms. Cole, is that you again?\" Good old Cookie's voice rings through the place, pulling my attention away from Bob. \"Cookie, I thought you were gone,\" I say with slight confusion, last I heard he was out of the area for some business. \"Can't stay away from you for too long,\" he winks, \"All right chaps?\" \"All right, Cookie,\" Comes the grumble from the boys. \"Want to be dealt in?\" Mumbles asks, only mildly interested. He sighs as he glances around the table, looking a bit conflicted. I can tell he only stopped by for a word with someone but the combination of great players we have is too tempting. He loosens a button on his jacket as he pulls up a chair, \"Can't stay for long, but throw us in for a quick spin.\" \"Maddy, is that you?\" My eyes jump up to see the always good looking One Two. He has appeared from somewhere in the back but if I had known he was here I would have gone to him first. I lift my face as he places a kiss at the top of my head and I answer, \"Always is.\" He makes a point of roughing up my hair before turning the second member of the crew, \"Mumbles, can I have a word with you?\" Their flamer banter begins and I-like all the others-have a good laugh, which is something I needed. Mumbles puts down his cards and chases after One Two. No doubt it's about work and I don't mind. The rules are: as long as their business was unheard my presence was undocumented. I plan on keeping it that way. I return my gaze to the table and see all the fellas are looking at me in that weird way people do. I ask, \"What's wrong?\" \"We heard about what happend,\" Fred the Head says, the ends of his eyes drooping downward. I immediately drop my eyes down to my cards. I should have expected someone to bring it up. Everyone here knew about my past with him, only people in the outside world didn't. as I shrug, \"I haven't seen him in fifteen years. I'm fine.\" \"Are you sure?\" it's Bob who is first to decipher my lie. \"We could talk about it if you want? I could take you for a ride. Clear your mind.\" I smile as I press my lips to the gentleman's cheek,\"Bob you are too good for anyone. Man or Woman.\" I find myself enjoying the sight of his blush but he recovers too soon,\"Thank you. You know, you're too good for that scum Matthew.\" I put my cards down on the table,\"That's where I go.\" Although I'm not crazy about Matthew he is still my boyfriend and my choice. I don't like people disagreeing with my choices. Handsome grabs my hand before I can step away, \"Now you sit down. I wont say another word.\" I plop back down in my seat and roll my eyes over in Cookie and Fred's direction, \"I bet you two have something on your minds, as well.\" They zip their lips and throw away the key. I burst into an uncontrollable laughter that feels so odd I don't know how to stop. Unfortunately someone else finds a way. My phone goes off and I roll my eyes; it's my father. I look around, \"Shut up! Shut up!\" The music stops and I answer the phone. My father's voice booms in the air, \"Now, where the hell are you?\" \"What do you mean, Father? Is something wrong?\" I asks in my pretend innocent voice. \"I got Matthew here, askin me to take you off the business I got you on. Last time I checked, I didn't have you on any business!\" he yells into my ear. \"I'm sorry but I just needed a momment to myself. Matthew was being way too friendly for the occasion. I needed time, I mean. You read the article yourself,\" I reply in a quiet voice. \"I told you not to mention that again,\" he hisses. \"Well, I'm sorry. I can't help it,\"I explain. \"Alright you take some time to yourself. And you get over this. He was a no good cr-\" \"I know, I know...\" I interrupt, tired of hearing that about him. \"You calm yourself now...Then you come on home. You hear?\" His voice is gentle and kind but I find myself despairing it all over again. Where was this kindness when I was young and needed it the most? \"Yes, Father,\" I recite the usual line. \"And you better not be at the Speeler!\" I shut the phone on that note and blush as I shove it in my pocket. I look to the others and sure enough they mimic and shout, \"'And you better not be at the Speeler!'\" \"Shut up!\" I snap, sticking my tongue out. \"That's not very lady like, now is it?\" Fred comments with a playful frown. I stick up my middle finger, \"Good thing I'm not a lady.\" There is a bout of laughter that enters the room until Cookie breaks the mood, \"He had class, your boy.\" \"He hasn't been my boy in a while,\" I snap. \"He will always be your boy,\"Cookie sighs. I don't know what about his words make my heart beat so fast but it does. One Two and Mumbles return and take a seat at the table. Mumbles picks up his cards while One Two grabs his own. He gestures to me with his chin, \"What brings you down to the slums on this fine afternoon?\" I shrug, \"I figured today was as good as any other to take your 'hard earned money'.\" \"Don't you always?\" One Two asks, a heavy sigh departing from his lips. There is something about the way he says it that reminds of Johnny and I find that pain I has been hiding coming forward all over again. I look away but my eyes land on Cookie who seems to be swollen with unspoken words, \"Don't you look like a fountain of words looking for a break.\" \"You know how hard it could be keeping your feelings inside. Especially ones that could make situations...\"he put his cards down softly to reveal his amazing hand,\"...ackward.\" I let out a soft giggle as I place my cards down before them to show an even better one. The men grumble and but I just laugh, \"You take those ackward feelings and my 'hard earned money' and hand it all overto Handsome over here. I will see you another day.\" \"Now, where do you think you are going?\" Mumbles asks. I sigh as I stand and press a kiss to Bob's head, \"Matthew awaits.\" I walk around the table, placing kisses on everyone's head. One Two sighs, \"You know you can do better than that scum.\" \"Oh, don't I,\" I smirk, winking at Bob. \"Now I bid you all farewell.\" I turn my back and walk away to let their goodbyes fall behind me. I leave the Speeler just as quickly as I came. I get into my car and pull the case from under my seat. My heart shivers as I open it to his face. I let my fingers cascade over his face. Cookie's words invade my mind. \"He will always be your boy.\" He will always be my boy.[Chapter 5] Fourteen Years Ago... \"Why does Mommy have to go?\" My question had been hidden behind an angry face because I did not want cry. I had been holding the teddy bear she bought be for my birthday because I didn't want to hear the answer. It had the softest brown fur and the largest blue eyes. In its butt was a secret compartment that held the lovely card mommy had given me and the secret money Archy had snuck under my pillow and the tape Johnny had forced me to keep. I wanted to hide in that secret compartment with the people I loved and the things they gave me-without my dad. \"Your Mum is sick,\"Archy's voice is steady like when he had taught me how to ride a bike. \"Why can't she see a doctor? Like my doctor?\" I had asked. My eyes focused up on him to watch Archy's face. \"Well, your doctor is for little girls. Your Mum is not a little girl,\" Archy tried to explain. I rolled my eyes at his sugar coat, \"I'm not a baby, Uncle Archy. I know. Why doesn't she see an adult doctor closer to us? Why does she have to stay so far away?\" \"Because the hospitals around here are too small,\" he had a smile on his face as if he were so clever with his words. \"Archy,\" I had whispered. My eyes were narrowed on the side of his face beside me because I needed to know. I held the teddy bear close as I asked, \"Is she going to die? Is it my fault all of them go?\" \"Now you stop right there, Mad,\" his voice was stern but not harsh, \"You take those thoughts right out of your head and you throw them to the birds.\" I nodded my head because that was all I could do. He had confirmed my worst fears by not confirming anything at all. A thought popped into my mind, brief and wordless, and I forced myself to turn around although my seatbelt hurt. I looked back to Johnny who had been sleeping so peacefully-an obvious lie because since mum had become sick he could hardly sleep at all. I returned my eyes to Archy with seriousness, \"Will Johnny stay with us? Always?\" \"I don't know,\" his voice was long and drawn out as if the real answer had been 'no' all along. Tears filled my eyes as I watched his face become stiff, \"I don't want him to leave, Archy, I want him to stay.\" \"I'll see what I can do, \"Archy said in his hushing voice. He patted my head, \"Now you get some shut eye. We've got a long way to go.\" Six Months Later... In my prettiest black dress I held onto my bear and held in my tears. Beside me was Johnny who couldn't be as tough as me. I had already been to a mother's funeral, this was his first. My eyes narrowed in on our mommy that laid sleeping at the end of the aisle. The coffin she rested in was sleek and pearl and fitted perfectly to her specific requests. It was beautiful, just like her. Or just like she was. That was it. Half way down the aisle my tears began to flow. She was dead and I had to pause because of it. I had lost another mother and there was no one left to care for me. Mother's were supposed to make you feel loved and she did. But all I could think was how no one would love me anymore. That was until Johnny took my hand. In his grief I had decided to leave him alone. My father had never taught me how to deal with sadness and so I just shut down. But with his face covered in tears he extended his hand to me and we were together in our despair. Uncle Archy behind us gently pushed us forward to our sleeping mother. I could feel my skin and my hands getting colder but Johnny didn't say anything. He didn't pull away. When we reached her, father was already waiting. I released Johnny's hand and stood next to him on the steps. Johnny turned his back to us. I knew he wasn't ready to see; he would never be ready to see. I stood at the side and looked over the edge to what laid inside. On her lips was her favorite shade of pink and her brown hair flowed around her head with little flowers tucked into the strands. She had on a lovely black dress made of lace. I thought it must be new because I had never seem it before. She looked so simple, as if she were just sleeping. I wanted to wake her up, why couldn't she just wake up? Father guided me away from my place and it was Johnny's turn to gaze inside. My heart nearly shattered at the sight of his crumbling face. He reached in to touch her arm, as if to waken her as he had done many times before, but she did not stir. I wiped at my eyes as he cried harder. I stepped forward to comfort him but father beat me to it. He yanked Johnny's arm as he hissed, \"Be a man and suck up those tears.\" \"Don't you think that's a bit much, Len? He just lost his mum,\" Arch spoke, coming to John's defense. \"It's never too early to teach a boy to be a man,\" was my father's only response. Johnny yanked his arm away and walked over to my side. My hand instinctively grasped his so I could guide him down the steps to our seat. Although I had the nod that Johnny would live with us I wasn't sure if I could keep my sanity in my father's house. As if he knew what I was thinking, Johnny squeezed my hand and gave me a defiant look. We could make it, his look said, we could survive. Now... My father's house is the same home that Johnny and I used to live in and yet it always seems so foreign. It's been the same since I was ten-same locks, same codes, same guards, same everything. The only thing that's changed is me and John. I step out of my car and make my across the drive way. It's such an empty house.[Chapter 6] Thirteen Years Ago... I had been hiding behind the door that connected our rooms so I could watch one of Johnny's many performances. It had become a custom for me to watch and laugh in hiding. If he knew I was there he would stop for good and I didn't want that. I wanted to watch the practice. In front of his mirror he sang but I knew he was millions of miles away on stage for millions of people. I knew he could do it. He had talent. He had class. His voice sang loud above his music, \"He just loved to live that way, He loved to steal your money, Some is ri-\" A torpedo stormed into the room and behind it a tornado of anger and hatred. My father shut off the music with his face so red. Johnny turned still with his toy sax still in his hand. I shut my eyes before the smack came but still the sound resonated through out me. I opened my eyes and there Johnny was staring with fire where his pupils had been. I hated when they both looked so angry. \"Now listen to me boy. Listen. I never did like you and niether did your real dad. Your a reject, a wrong, and a fucking fairy in the mirror that I inherited from your mum. But she ain't with us no more. It's just you, Madeline, and me. Now next week you're going back to school, the most expensive fucking school in this country I might add, and then you'll be gone for a whole term,\" his voice was harsh and loud and shook through the entire room and my core. How could he be so cruel, \"In the mean time show some fucking gratitude and keep the fucking music down!\" Father turned his back to Johnny and walked his way out of the room. A sigh of relief had escaped my lips. Father was known for ruling his men with an iron fist and his home was no different. If that was the end of it Johnny would be safe. I opened the door slightly wider with the hopes of comforting Johnny and confirming Father's words were a lie but he had other plans. Once the door shut behind Father, Johnny stood with vengeance in his eyes. He was too focused to know I was there as he lifted his toy sax and turned the stereo on to full volume. He glared at the door and shouted with all his might,\"Some is rich and some is poor and that's the way the world is! And I don't believe in lying back and saying how bad your life is!\" It was like a horror movie the way Father opened the door and undid his belt. I couldn't watch the rest. I shut the door and ran to my bed where I hid under the blankets with my eyes shut and my ears shielded. I could just make out the sound of leather on skin. I waited until the muffled music behind my hands shut off before i crawled from my bed. The door slammed soon after and after that came his heavy footsteps. I crawled to the door once more, making sure to be tiny and quiet in all the ways Father had taught me. Johnny was on the ground curled in a fetal position but when he saw me he sat up quick and tried to wipe his tears and ignore his wounds. I kneeled beside him and wrapped my arms around his head and pulled him into my chest. I stroked at his hair gently and he didn't flinch away from me. He wrapped his arms around my middle and held me close as I held him. I rubbed his head as he cried, he only ever cried in front of me. Now... The sound of a door slamming wakes me from my not so deep slumber. I get to my feet quickly and step into my slippers as I grab my robe and tie it around myself. I grasp my gun from my bed side table and slip it into my robe pocket. Silently I pad my way into the hallway to listen to what's going on. Even from my room I can hear voices in my father's study. I walk to the voices and am just in time to hear Arch's best line,\"If a slap don't work you cut him or you pay him, but you keep the recite 'cause this ain't the mafia.\" The troops pile out past me, making sure to keep their heads down. I can count on my hands in fond remembrance how many slaps Archy dolled out for inappropriate glancing when I was in my robe. I furrow my brows, \"Archy, what's all this for?\" \"Your father's painting was stolen,\" he answers simply. That's all that needs to be said. \"The one Uri gave him?\" I ask with wide eyes. I was there as eye candy when he gave it to him. Always a possibility but never a certainty, I was. \"Right, oh,\" he sighs, lifting his hand up to rub his neck uncomfortably. \"Do you needed my help?\" is my next question. God knows I can use a distraction. He smiles and pats my head like he always does, \"Don't trouble yourself, darling. Get back to bed. You've had a rough day.\" \"That obvious?\" I give him a sheepish look that doesn't bother to hide my fatigue. \"Don't worry. Only to those who know you best,\" he pacifies and for the first time since the news came out I can see the sadness creep into his features, \"It's alright, love. The way he was going...it's probably for the best what happened to him.\" Anger pulses through me as I glare at the ground. My control is beyond me so my tone is harsh, \"Because he was a crack head?\" \"Because you and I knew him best,\" his voice catches my attention and I look into his eyes and see seriousness, \"What do you think the real Johnny was doing inside him while he was cracking up? He was dying. There're things we could've done and there're things we couldn't. We'll never know where our actions lie.\" My arms wrap around Archy in a tight hug that catches him by surprise. He sighs and gives his nice chuckle. I look to him and smile weakly, \"I love you, Arch.\" \"I love you too, Mad,\" He grins. I pull away and see. his sticky fingers had snatched my gun in the seconds it took to embrace, \"Now what were you planning on doing with this?\" I grin, \"'There are things we can do and things w-'\" \"Aye, don't be cheeky,\" he says, making me laugh. He puts the gun down on Father's desk and begins to mush around some papers. I wonder what happened to make my Father the leader and not this great man. It should be him, \"Now, there're some friends of yours that've offered a wealthy sum to make something disappear. What should we do about it?\" My eyes shoot open because I know who he's talking about. He talking about making Handsome's paper work vanish in that mysterious way they know how. I smile so wide my lips my burst from my face but I lower it and try to look calm and nonchalant, \"I say...if you got a black hat, why not pull a rabbit out of it?\" He winks, \"I knew you'd say that. Now get outta here.\" I nod my head, \"Gladly.\" ","Summary":" \"She will always be my fa-vorite line.

Enjoy! \"Come ON Rose, the taxi will be here in any minute!\" Screamed my best friend Lucy for the hundreth time. I puffed out a long sigh, I was so not in the mood for partying or dancing tonight. All I wanted to do is curl up with a nice cup of coffee and catch up with Tru Blood. But no, Lucy bugs me again and again that it would be good for the both of us to shake our hips like Beyonce and flirt with the boys at this new club that had just opened. My rejections went to deaf ears to her, she had already booked a ride two hours before and was halfway through getting ready. It complety stuns me how she does it. Adding the finishing touches of my lipstick, I pout my lips at my reflection then got up to grab my purse that lay on my bed and left my bedroom. \"Wow, you look amazing girl!\" Lucy cried, clapping her hands. I smile at her, in fact she was right. With a sparkly purple dress and my hair loose, I really made a effort. Not that I'm arrgoant or love myself but it makes me feel good that I'm comfortatable in my own skin. Lucy looks amazing too with her little black dress and her blonde hair up in a tight ponytail. A horn came meaning that the taxi had arrived so we stepped outside to a warm and quiet Saturday night in London and were on our way in a matter of seconds getting in the vehicle. Arriving twenty minutes later with a few traffic problems, I paid the driver with a added tip and went to join Lucy who stood in the queue. \"I hope this place will be better than last week, too many dick-heads and lack of cocktails make me very sad.\" She said, pulling a face that made me giggle. The rather large bodyguard checked our id which he agreed to that he unhooked the red chain and let us in. I could hear and feel the booming music vibrating the walls, Lucy was squealing and skipping towards the double doors that stood before us. Pushing them, we gasped of how massive and quite packed the club was. Women and men dancers were in a glass cublicle, grabbing everyone's attention with their moves. \"Wow this place rocks!\" Lucy shouted to me. I nodded in agreement, it did look pretty cool. We headed down the staircase and went straight towards the bar where she ordered a cocktail for herself and a Diet Coke for me as I don't drink. I found empty seats just a few meters from the dance floor, they were comfortable yet made a embrassing noise once you move on it. Some men were eyeing up Lucy as she came to me holding the glasses very carefully, luckily she didn't notice them and sat next to me. We sipped our drinks in silence while watching everyone boogie and listening to the up to date music blaring out of the speakers. I turned to face my friend only that she was eye-flirting with one of the guys that was doing the same to her, not bad looking but not my type. \"He's so mine.\" She whispered, getting up and walking towards him leaving me alone. I sighed once more, Lucy had more luck finding men than me. The last relationship I had was three years ago with a guy that was a cruel jerk, he broke my heart several times until I found the coruage to leave him. Since then, I had been single and was hating it. They say it's the best thing, live your life and not to worry about finding Mr Right until you're ready. Try telling that to a twenty-eight year old woman who had a depressing past and a very bleak future with my job in retail in trouble and hardly any friends apart from Lucy. My parents died when I was fifteen due to a horrific car acident on the M25, they were coming home from a wonderful holiday until a drunk driver crashed into them. He was arrested, denying the murder at court and got off with a slap on the wrist. Never had so much anger and hatred boiled in me when he walked away with a Chesire grin across his face. But fate had a funny way of playing, he was killed by a single shot in the chest when a bank robbery went wrong one September morning. Seeing it on the news that day was shocking yet bittersweet. May that evil bastard rot in hell. Shaking my tortured memories aside, I turned my head to the staircase for some strange reason to see a sight that made my heart stop for real. There standing like a angel was the most handsome man I had seen for a long time, he went down those steps with elegance and poise that would put everyone else to shame. Moving towards the bar like slow montion, I didn't notice that my jaw had dropped and looked like a fish. I was completly taken by this mysterious stranger. But when he turned his head to where I was, my cheeks burned firey crimson yet I couldn't take my eyes off him. To my horror and surprise, he left the bar to come towards me with each step making my body tremble. The music changed to a slow and sedcutive tune I hadn't heard of but for now, I will remember every lyric and melody until my dying day. Colourful lights flashed across his face, everyone of them were wonderful especially on him. How the hell am I supposed to look at them the same way again? He stopped just a few meters from where I was sitting, I swallowed constanlty like trying to get rid of a lump at the back of my throat. Rising his hand up, a smirk appeared on his lips. Hot damn, he wants to dance with me! Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Author's Note: Part Two Coming Soon![Chapter 2] Sparkles In Your Eyes Part Two Is Here, Enjoy! You know when everything goes slow motion at a perfect moment? This is exactly how I was feeling when I took his hand and spun me around to the dance floor. I didn't notice Lucy spitting out her drink in shock of what she saw before her, the guy she was talking to tried his best to grab her attention but proved fruitless. Everyone else stopped to look at us too, strangely amazed of how in sync we were. A mysterious stranger, a beautiful woman (yeah right), dancing together. Was it meant to be? Was fate playing it's hand in my love life? That I didn't know. All I wanted was right now, what ifs were far away from my mind. Swaying our hips, eyes never leaving from each other, the haunting woman's voice pouring her heart out over her lover and how she wanted to be with him forever. It wasn't long until the song came to a end, we stopped at the very last note. We stood, in each other's arms, just close enough for our lips to touch. So here I was, going to kiss the most amazing and wonderful stranger, when all the sudden loud cheering and clapping broke our bittersweet moment. He pulled away first while I rubbed my neck and laughed nervously but when I turned to look at him, he had strangely disappeared without a trace. My eyes widened in shock, how could he go like that in a matter of seconds? My heart pounded furiously, not only did I feel betrayed but swept away by him. \"Rose, that was amazing! But where did he go?\" Lucy said, snapping me from my thoughts. \"I don't know.\" I replied, looking at her until I noticed a small card by my feet. Picking it up, there was only one name. ONE-TWO. \"One-Two? What kind of crappy name is that?\" Lucy said. We were heading home half a hour later, alone and confused of what had happened. \"It's strange, normally a guy's name would be James or Nick or Richard. But One-Two? I have a uneasy feeling that's a gangster's name.\" I replied, looking at the card still in my hand. Lucy gasped that caught my attention. \"No way, I'm not having you dating a gangster. From the stories I heard, they charm their victims but put their lives in danger from other gangs.\" She explained. A chill ran down my spine. \"Don't worry Lucy, it's not like I'm going to see him again anyway. Just that when we were dancing, it seemed so right.\" I said with a longing sigh. She placed a comforting hand on my lap. \"I know but I'm only warning you, Rose. I don't know what I would if something happned to you, I'd never forgive myself.\" I smiled at her, understanding every word. But when I turned to look out of the window, no-one noticed the trail of tears that was falling down my face. Three Weeks Later... With a yawn coming out my mouth and my eyes focusing on the clock, it wasn't long until my shift here was done for the week. A reminder of tonight's events appeared in my mind, I was going out to visit a new art museum that was opening. Lucy had somehow (she didn't tell me) got invitations for the both of us, a thing that blocked my troubling thoughts of the mysterious One-Two. Though I pulled a brave face and lied through my teeth that I was fine, deep down my heart was rotting of how wonderful and cruel that night was. I kept the card in my diary where I wrote every single night of my worries, fears and thoughts that I felt. \"Alright Rose, don't think I didn't catch you looking at the time constanly.\" My boss, Larry, said. I turned to face him, showing a faint smile. He was a sweetheart Larry was, mature in his thirty-eight years with golden eyes and brown hair. A charmer and easy around women yet he was happily married with two growing daughters. \"Sorry sir, won't happen again.\" I replied, rubbing my neck. \"Not to worry, I know you got a special event tonight. Why don't you go and I'll shut the shop up?\" He offered. \"Oh no, it's my turn today.\" I pleaded but he placed a hand up. \"Go on, you don't want to be late do you?\" A wide grin went across my face. \"Thanks sir, I'll make sure I will next time.\" I said, kissing his cheek to jog up the staircase and collect my jacket that hung up on the coat hook. Waving Larry goodbye, I left the shop with a hop in my walk. Perhaps tonight would take my mind off things, especially One-Two. A few hours later, me and Lucy arrived at the art museum where it was packed of people and stunning paintings on the white walls. Taking a glass of white wine, I wandered through the rooms while Lucy was gladly chatting up the bar tender who was without doubt her type this time. Some drawings took my intrest for a good long while but for the others, they were either dull or hardly emotional. I never really enjoyed art in school but it beats staying at home on a Friday night. But when I walked towards a very large painting, my jaw dropped of how very real it looked. Called \"The Forbidden Pair\", there was a man and a woman, naked, staring in each others eyes. It was their faces that stunned me, very strangely they looked like me and One-Two. No, I'm obviously gone mad or something. Why does he always haunt my thoughts? Knowing that the evening was now ruined all by a certain someone, I went to turn away until I bumped into a broad body. \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" I cried, checking that I didn't spill my drink on his tux. \"It's okay, my fault of standing behind you.\" Replied a rich and spine-chilling voice. My eyes rose to a another handsome man with brown choclate eyes and brown hair, his smile was warm and comforting. \"I... I...\" Ugh, I hated stuttering around people! \"Speechless, are we?\" He teased, rising a eyebrow. Come on Rose, get yourself together! \"No, I was completly taken by that painting that's all.\" That was a lie. \"Yes, I must admit that it does take one's fancy.\" He stood beside me, the sleeve of his jacket touched my open skin that gave me goosebumps. \"Indeed it does.\" I replied, sipping my drink. I lifted my head to see that he was staring right in my eyes, damn it he's hot! In fact, he looked more youthful than One-Two. Pah! Why should I think about that guy anymore, he left me so I'm moving on. \"The name's Archie,\" He said, offering his hand. I swallowed that annoying lump at the back of my throat yet I was taken by surprise that this guy had a actull proper name and no sign of him being a gangster. \"Rose.\" I replied, placing mine into his for a geniune and quite lovely handshake. Perhaps I might stay here for a little longer! Author's Note: Bear With Me With Updates, I'm Slowly Getting Better So I Will Try And Get Chapters Up As Soon As I Can.[Chapter 3] Sparkles In Your Eyes Part Three Though I really enjoyed meeting Archie and taking his moblie number, it didn't shake the blues once me and Lucy were in the taxi heading home. Because all I could think of was one person- One Two. How can a man who I didn't even say a single word affect everything I did? The ride was in uncomfortable silence, hell even when we entered our home, none of us said a word to one another. Strange really as Lucy seemed quite taken about me and Archie's converastion. But she had suddenly changed once my face fell. Perhaps it was him, the mysterious dancer that took everything from me in one whole night and left total utter destruction behind. It had been a week since the art museum encounter with Archie, a few texts from him bought a smile across my face but it didn't seem enough. Selfish, I know. He was so nice, warm, smelt good and damn handsome too. So why arren't I that bothered to accept a date with him? I know, One-Two is the reason. Shaking my tottured thoughts aside, I focused on my work and getting home after five pm to meet Lucy for a drink at the nearby pub we go every Thursday. On my way there, my eyes fell on a handsome man that stood by the doors smoking. His hair was finally growing of what possiably was a shaved head, clear eyes and lips to rival Angelina Jolie. He had a rugged charm about him that bought warmth in my body, I couldn't deny a slight grin appearing across my face. But once he turned to look at me, my cheeks blushed violently. That breath-taking smile was enough for me to be instanly smitten by this guy, so long Archie and One-Two for now I guess though I really shouldn't say things like that. Once he walked towards me, I knew that Lucy will go ape with all these guys suddenly interested in boring old me. Was it my clothes? The way I did my hair? Hell I know. \"Hey beautiful.\" He spoke in a silky voice, London based yet ever so extraordinly unlike anyone else. \"Hello, I'm Rose. What's your name?\" I asked, folding my arms. \"The name's Bob or you call me Handsome Bob.\" He replied, taking my hand and kissed it. I giggled, what a old fashioned gentleman! We stood there for a few moments, looking deep in each other's eyes. \"Wanna come and meet me mates?\" Bob offered, pointing his thumb down the road pass the pub. \"Oh no, I'm meeting a friend. Maybe another time?\" I said, shaking my hand. \"Oh okay then, no worries. See you around then.\" He sounded very disappointed, I hated that. With a long sigh, I gave in. \"Alright I'll come with you, I'll tell Lucy that I'm busy or something.\" His smile reappeared that warmed my heart, I wonder if all the girls wouldn't give to be in my shoes or unless he already had a girlfriend and just wanted me to meet his friends or whatever. I dug out my phone and texted Lucy, sent it and stuffed it back in my bag. \"Let's go then.\" I said. Bob offered his arm which I gladly took and we walked down the streets looking very much like a couple. We arrived at a shady and dodgy looking place but Bob reassured me with a knowing smile and opened the door for me. Seriously, he must be out of a old romance novel! Entering inside, the smell of smoke and sweat instanly went in my nose. My eyes noticed a woman sitting on the stool, flicking through the newish issue of Heat magazine and sipping tea. \"Yo Mumbles!\" Bob yelled, leaving me aside to rush towards his mate. \"Come and meet Rose, she's a stunner.\" He was a good looking black man with rich eyes and a sweet smile. \"Nice to meet you, Rose.\" He said, offering his hand which I quickly shook. \"Nice to meet you too, Mumbles.\" I replied, with a grin. \"Come and sit with us.\" Bob suggested which we did. Horse racing was on the tv, a large board had the odds on it, a few other people were playing cards and chatting among themselves. It seemed like a comfortable place to hang out for a while. \"'ello, who have we got here?\" A older looking man stood, staring right at me. \"Cookie, this is Rose.\" Bob said. \"Ah, a bird eh? Didn't think you were interested in them, Bob.\" He replied, giving him a shifty look. I watched Cookie walk away, then turned to Bob who shook his head. \"What was that about?\" I asked, putting my hands on my lap. \"Nothing babe, nothing to worry about.\" Bob answered with a false smile. Nodding in understanding, my eyes moved around towards the door where my heart had all the sudden completly stopped and everything was frozen around me. It couldn't be! There standing like a rebel and oozing such sexual charsmia was One-Two, wearing tight demin jeans and a black top that hugged his muscles. It was his eyes that shone so beautifully that it put every other colour to shame. But when those orbs fell on mine, the horror written across his handsome face couldn't be mistaken. With three large steps towards us, the moment of me admiring him was brutally shattered like a mirror. \"Bob, who the HELL is she?\" He screamed, pointing a large finger at me. \"Oh, hi One-Two! This is Rose, I met her today and invited her here. Is that a crime?\" He replied, placing a arm across my shoulders. Suddenly he grabbed Bob's t-shirt and dragged him to a quiet area, slamming the door behind him. Shivers upon shivers ran up and down my spine, not once did I witness someone so angry like that. \"Jeez, what the hell is One-Two's problem?\" Cookie asked, coming to sit next to me. \"Hell I know, ever since Stella broke things off with him, he's been a right grumpy bastard.\" Mumbles explained. Never had I felt so unwelcome and alone, it was time to leave. Making my excuses to them to get up from the chair, it was right at that very moment that One-Two stormed towards me. He took my wrist in a very tight grip, leading me towards a another room and once more slammed the door behind him. I backed right away, afraid and frightened of what he might do to me. \"NEVER come here again, do you understand? NEVER.\" One-Two said in a cruel and mencing tone. I looked right through those eyes, without me noticting he had already stolen my heart and soul. \"Why?\" I trembled, igorning the weakness in my voice. \"We are gangsters, I'm not willing to put anyone's life in danger especially you.\" He replied, suddenly soft and quite moving. How close we are, our bodies nearly touching yet I could feel the warmth pouring out of him. I studied everything on his face, was the break-up with Stella just one of several things that troubled him? It had to be minutes that we stood there, staring at each other. Someone had to say something, the silence was bittersweet yet there were words that had to be said from my mouth. \"I.. understand, One-Two. Really I do.\" That was when he stepped aside so I could be free and walk away from this place never to step here ever again. But I didn't want to. \"Go now.\" He said in a tone of voice I couldn't reconise. With a simple nod, I began to move my shaky legs towards the door not without placing my hand across his chest that could perhaps left a mark there. I opened the door, lowered my head to avoid anyone's gazes and left that place within a few seconds. Once the air came to touch my skin as I headed back home, I felt the tears flowing down my cheeks.[Chapter 4] Sparkles In Your Eyes So Sorry That I Haven't Updated This Lately, Life Has Been Hell But Here Is Part Four. Enjoy! Okay you may think I'm a cold woman that is living on this cruel earth by rushing into a relationship with Archie. After a quite successful dinner and movie date, our first kiss together was strong and very passionate. Surprising because I ain't been kissed like that in all my life, this guy is a second choice compared to other people. Yeah, I mean you One-Two. Mr Angry yet ever so senstive and godamn beautiful. Oh stop it, Rose! Lucy was a little suspious of my quick action of jumping in Archie's arms so quickly after that horrid incident a few weeks ago. Yet it wasn't long until she started to warm for us being a couple and always wished me luck for every date. But not one person really knew what I was really feeling, the ugly truth of my inner core. I was torn, shattered, broken, stunned, confused, lost, empty and left wondering if perhaps we could encounter each other one day. Right, that's it. No more thinking about One-Two, it ends today. I'm happy with Archie and I'm staying that way. So three months have blown by like a gust of wind, changes are all around me. Lucy has finally (could it be?) found the right guy in Darren, he's sweet and treats her correctly. Me and Archie are growing even closer, there wasn't a single day that I didn't miss out on seeing his face. Even if I wanted to stay at home instead of going to his place, we had late phone calls until one of us fell asleep. Yeah, I could feel it. I was begining to fall in love with him in a slow yet lovely way. All thoughts of One-Two faded away, I couldn't even remember his face and perhaps it's better that way. What was I thinking that we could meet each other again one day? He was the one that told me to leave and never step anywhere near him again. Well, he was the loser really. I grew stronger and can hold my head up high that I am happy at last. Heading towards the bank to check my balance, I didn't expect to have my world turn upside down. Three masked men burst through the doors, holding sawed off shotguns, shouting and swearing at the top of their voices. Screams and pounding of feet echoed the walls while I stood there, frozen in the spot with horror across my face. One of them, taller than the others, paced towards me pointing his weapon at me until something made him pause. Those eyes, so familer, I gasped of how sharp and glittering they really were. It couldn't possiably be who I thought it was, was it? \"Get on the ground.\" He ordered with a gruff voice. But I didn't make a single move, it was like my whole body was stiff. Rebeling every rule in the book, I rose my hands to where the end part of the mask was and carefully unrolled it. I could feel the costumers, the workers and the other robbers were watching us without a word out of their mouths. My heart pounded like a beating drum as I tore the mask off the man's face to be competly stunned but not surprised of who stood in front of me. One-Two. All those feelings returned with a brutal revenge, overtaking everything I had for Archie or any kind of normal life. Before I could touch his cheek, one swift hand grabbed my wrist in a tight grip while the gun slammed on the floor shattering our moment. \"Why did you do that?\" He hissed, burning a intense gaze back at me. I shook my head, empty of words or understanding the situation. \"Bob, Mumbles. Get the money and get the hell out of here!\" He snapped his head at the other two robbers. They nodded at his order and went to do what they were told. One-Two turned back at me, showing a strange emotion I couldn't figure out. \"I haven't forgotten the touch you left me, Rose.\" He muttered in a tone that send rapture shivers rippling up and down my body. Fighting through my memories, a flash of my hand grazing at the part of where his heart beated really shocked me. \"Remember now?\" He said, snapping me from my train of thought. \"Don't do this to me now, I've moved on.\" I replied, strongly. A frown appeared across his face. \"That's right, One-Two. I'm with someone.\" Yeah, it wasn't wise to tease him like that. He instanly let go of my wrist, leaving a burning mark there. \"Fine. You were just like Stella there: in control and spills so many lies. Be happy with whoever you are with but think of this:\" This is when he bend down to where my ear was and whispered something that I never thought he would say. \" I Burn For You, Rose. Every Single Day, Every Single Night.\" With that, he snatched the mask that was in my hand to put it back on and dashed out of the bank. I stood there, shaking like a leaf threatening to fall from the tree. Handsome Bob jogged towards me, not afraid to show his good looking face to the public. \"What One-Two said to you is true. See you around hopefully.\" I watched him leave with Mumbles, a uneasy silence fell over the building. Wailing sirens of the police was in the distance, everyone on the floor rose up not daring themselves to look at me. What happened next was all a blur, I fainted with a sigh surrending to the darkness waiting to claim me.[Chapter 5] Sparkles In Your Eyes Part Five Lucy and Archie came to see me lying on a hosptail bed as I slowly opened my eyes and saw their faces. \"Oh my God, are you alright Rose? I was so worried about you!\" Lucy cried, grabbing my ever so warm hand. \"Yeah, I think so.\" I replied gruffly, my eyes darting to Archie who didn't seem like the same emotion like my friend did. \"What happened? A lot of people said that two of the robbers spoke to you?\" She asked, staring at me seriously. I turned away, flashbacks appearing in my mind drove me to shut away the tears that were forming in the back of my eyes. \"Please I don't really want to talk about it, can I go home now?\" I replied in a voice even I couldn't reconize. \"Sure but the doctors said to keep in for the rest of the day. I'll go and ask him.\" With that, I heard the chair squeak and Lucy's thundering footsteps echoing the hollow walls. Slowly moving my head to face Archie, a stern frown was across his handsome features. \"It was the Wild Bunch, wasn't it?\" He asked, with added concern. I straightened my back instanly, stunned and shocked of his question. \"Why, do you know them?\" I answered, fear and worry filled my blood. \"Of coarse I do! It wasn't long ago that they were in big trouble with the Headmaster of London.\" He snapped, standing up and throwing his hands in the air. I faintly remembered a story written about a missing painting from a angry Russian who demanded it back, there was a awful lot of violence and shifty work but I didn't take much notice of it. \"They are gangsters, Rose. I don't want them anywhere near you, especially One-Two.\" Archie said, quietly. I gave him a passionate stare, one that hopefully hid all my secrets from him. But it didn't work, he could see right through me and the look of horror was enough of a answer. \"Oh Rose, you are in some deep crap now!\" He brushed through his hair with his hands. \"Why Archie, why am I in trouble?\" I asked, touching his shoulder which made him sit beside me on the bed. \"Because he's a player and a user. I never trusted him, not while we were working together. Handsome Bob and Mumbles are better men, though they are bad enough to join in that seedy life. One-Two treated Stella like a piece of rotten rubbish, always slagging her off because her gay husband wouldn't divorce her and... no I shouldn't be telling you this.\" He shook his head. \"No, you must tell me Archie. I need to know.\" I pleaded, taking his hands into my own. \"Why? What has he told you?\" He asked, staring at me so deeply that a large lump appeared at the back of my throat. I tried to swallow my fears, took a steady breath and told them the words that would haunt us forever. Archie rose, gasping for air and pacing around the room shaking his head violently. \"He can't have you, he WON'T have you!\" He pointed a deadly finger at my direction. I lowered my gaze, letting those forbidden tears fall down my face. \"Surely you don't have feelings for him, do you?\" That question froze my heart compeltly. What could I say? That I did have feelings for him? That I fell in love with him the moment I laid eyes on him? No, I had to lie to save our relationship though really it was already damanged. \"I don't Archie, all I feel is you.\" I replied, looking directly in the eye. Thankfully he breathed out a sigh of relief, came to my side and hugged me. \"I will never let you go, Rose. No matter what.\" He cooed in my ear, comforting me. The warmth of his body soothed me until I jumped back into that black oblivion of sleep. As we returned home, Archie, being ever the gentleman, gathered me in his arms, jogged up the staircase and laid me on the double bed we share. Taking off my clothes and his own, we got under the sheets and made love not once but twice slowly and quite passionately. Though he gave me orgsams and let me fly above the night sky with a bright smile on my face, one thought of him brings me down to a crashing halt. While he slept peacefully, I remained awake struggling with my mind refusing to switch off. I looked at the window where the half moon shone proudly without any stars tonight, I wondered where One-Two was. Did his words speak the truth? Was Archie right all along? Am I in love with him for real? Too many questions filled my thoughts, leaving with no answers. I shut my eyes, blocking them all away and tried to think of something happy. There I was, standing in a beautiful garden with the haunting sounds of Enya echoing the clear air. I wander through with a smile, wearing a loose summer dress and my hair in ringlets. Before my very eyes stood a tall man that had his back towards me. Like he sensed someone was behind him, he turned and that was when I gasped at the sight before me. He wore white shirt, blue jeans and smart trainers. His hair was recently cut, no sign of a stubble on his face. Beautiful. He stared at me like he know every part of me. Like magic I walked towards him without fear shouting in my head. Our hands connect, a powerful surge of electric burned between us. We look at each other, prepared to make that move. Only he was first to capture my lips for a passionate kiss. So warm and wonderful I felt until the picture began to fade away... I awoke with a gasp, my body all clummy and sweaty. Early rays of the sun was appearing outside. Archie was still fast asleep, a gentle moan escaped from his lips. I gathered my breath back, thinking furiously of what that dream meant. It wasn't Archie or One-Two I was kissing. It was Handsome Bob! Author's Note: Argh, The Confusion For Poor Rose! Sorry There Hasn't Been Many Updates Lately, Been A Bit Poorly But I Will Make Sure I Keep Writing. Hope You Like This Chapter![Chapter 6] Sparkles In Your Eyes Part Six Why couldn't I get that dream out of my mind? It was silently driving me insane, my behaviour was changing and wasn't left unnoticed to Lucy or Archie. \"Rose, is there something wrong?\" She asked me during our Thursday drink time at the pub. I stared at her, fearing my walls could break down and all the words threatening to spill out would destory me. With a swift shake of my head, a weak smile and blocking the tears from my eyes, I replied \"No, I'm fine.\" But I wasn't. Far from it. What were my feelings doing to me? Did I love One-Two? Was my relationship with Archie, my comforter and protector, over already? Why did I feel strangely drawn to Handsome Bob? I need to know the answers somewhere. I had to find One-Two and Handsome Bob, sort this out once and for all. One Sunday afternoon, I made myself ready and left Archie's house while he was very busy in his office. Waving my hand for a taxi, I told the driver where I needed to go and leaned back on the seat. The slow and gentle rocking was making my eyes droop, then again for the last couple of night I hadn't slept. No wonder I was so grumpy, snapping at costumers and was almost fired because I nearly got involved in a fight. I was changing into someone I didn't want to be, Archie was deeply concerned and kept a very close eye on me. A good enough excuse of taking a walk sasfiyed him as long as I returned before the sun set. More like Cinderella but with a time difference. Sure I loved his idea of protecting me but there was a limit and he was pushing it to the point where our relationship could finish today. Shaking my troubled thoughts aside, the taxi pulled up to where I wanted to go and paid him with a good tip. Taking a massive deep breath, I stepped inside the place smelling the familer scent of smoke and male sweat. My eyes fell on the woman who must have a monthly thing with Heat nod her head at me which I replied in return. \"Rose?\" Said a voice that warmed my blood instanly. Turning towards it, there stood Handsome Bob with the most adoreable smile across his face. \"Hey Bob, how are you doing?\" I said, igorning the pounding of my heart beating against my chest. \"I'm great, now you're here.\" He replied, making me blush. A warm hug was enough for me to breathe him in, mixure of aftershave and rather posh male perfume. I was the first to pull away, our eyes burning against each others. He was pushing his face very close to mine, ever so dangerous and risky it was. My heart was really thundering now, good God was my dream coming true? \"WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE AGAIN?\" Roared the voice of One-Two that broke us apart to stare at him in horror. He was rough and disturbing, icy cold anger burned in those wonderful eyes and his body was posed a alarming threat. Storming towards us, not once breaking eye contact from me, he used his height a great deal that made me tremble with fear. \"AND WHY IS SHE ABOUT TO KISS A GAY MAN?\" That cut me to ribbons, shattered my heart and tore my soul apart. Tearing my gaze from One-Two to Handsome Bob, who looked tearful and extremly hurt. Mumbles and the others stared at us, he was prepared to take One-Two away if anything happened. \"Why didn't you tell me, Bob?\" I asked in a quiet voice. \"Because it felt wrong to tell you as I was starting to change and fall for you.\" He replied. Everyone gasped, inculding One-Two who stumbled back. \"You can't have her, Bob. She is Archie's dirty goods.\" He said cruelly. That was when I took a real look at One-Two for the first time since I laid eyes on him. I was in lust with him, not love. Who wouldn't with a handsome face, mysterious eyes and a lovely Scottish voice that curled his rs perfectly? Just not me. \"How dare you? You told me back at the robbery that you burned for me and Bob said it was true? What are you, some Jekyal and Hyde person?\" I yelled. He looked dead ahead at me, rage was hissing through his mouth. \"That's because it was a lie.\" He spat, placing the final nail on the coffin of my feelings for him. I shook my head, telling myself not to break down. \"Archie was right, you are a user. I feel for Stella, she got the guts to walk away from you when she did.\" Hitting a raw nerve, I didn't expect One-Two's hand slap against my cheek so violently that I slammed on the floor in shock. Bob punched him instanly across his nose, shouting rude words that even I won't repeat. Mumbles came to pull him away while the Heat magazine lady dashed to my side offering kindess which I took gladly. One-Two was bleeding, he deserved it. Bob was like a ranting manic with his angry eyes and strong body, a terrifying yet breath-taking sight. \"You stay away from Rose, One-Two! Do you hear me?\" He warned, pointing a finger very close to his broken nose. \"Fine, let her be with trash and gay boys. It wouldn't last with her anyway, bitch.\" He hissed, burning a intense gaze at me before he walked away to clean up. Bob looked at me and the lady. \"Take her somewhere quiet and look after her until she's ready to leave.\" He ordered. The woman nodded, then helpped me lift myself from the floor but it was no use. Tears were flowing down my face, the sheer agony was killing my confidence. Suddenly, Bob gathered me in his strong arms and led me to a bedroom with a dim light flickering above and a creaky bed. \"That will be enough for you to rest, Rose.\" He said in a gentle voice that I wanted it to wrap me around like a blanket. \"T..thank you.\" I whimpered, carefully touching my bruised cheek only for his hand to replace mine. Staring at each other once more, there was so much to talk about. \"Rest, we will speak later.\" I nodded my head. He helpped me lower my body on the bed, a warm sheet covered me. Stroking my hair for a few moments, he whispered goodnight and walked out of the room. Sleep captured me instanly, taking me in it's beautiful and dark oblivion. Author's Note: So One-Two Is Out Of The Question Or Is He? Do You Argee With Handsome Bob's Sudden Change? Read And Review Please![Chapter 7] Sparkles In Your Eyes Part Seven This Chapter is for Shouldabeenblonde24, thanks for your review and support. I will try my hardest to make the chapters longer and give the characters depth, this one will focus on Rose and Handsome Bob. Thanks again! It was a couple of hours until I slowly awoke, a sharp pain instanly came across my face. Flashes of images appeared in my mind, some were terrifying and haunting for perhaps the rest of my life. But there were a few that comforted my weeping heart, the face and kindess of Handsome Bob. I couldn't deny that my jaw dropped at him being gay but what shocked me more that he was changing and had feelings for me. Somehow or somewhat, I had to speak to him somewhere quiet that One-Two hear or start a another fight. Brushing my hair by my fingers, I checked my watch under the dimming light. Horror washed over my body, it was half past seven. Way pass sunset, Archie was going to be mad! Suddenly standing up, I yelled out the stabbing agony all across me. The door burst open to reveal Handsome Bob rushing to my side, concern across his beautiful face. \"Rose? Are you okay?\" He asked softly, grabbing me by my arms. I stared at him in fear though the pain was begining to fade away thanks to his gentle touch. Slowly I calmed down, the frightened tears fell down my cheeks like a short waterfall. He carefully placed me back on the bed, my heart was pounding normally yet it had a slight fast beat every now and then. \"There, you're alright now.\" He whispered, stroking my wet face. Who wouldn't tremble at the sweet caress by this lovely man? \"Thank you,\" I said, showing him a weak smile which he did in return. \"You're welcome, Rose.\" He leaned against the wall, not once taking those eyes away from me. \"Bob, I really need to go back to Archie. He's going to kill me that I haven't returned before sunset.\" I pleaded though really I was moaning like a child. \"Hey, you've been in a fight. I'm not taking you back until you are one hundred per cent.\" He reassured me. But I shook my head in disargeement. \"No, I have to go home. I don't want any more violence today, I've already seen enough to last me a lifetime.\" He turned away from me perhaps the first ever time since he came in this room. The tenison and edge was written across his whole body, I could feel it within meters from him. \"Rose, I meant what I said back there. I do have feelings for you though I was gay before I met you.\" He said in a voice I couldn't reconize. I stared at him deeply, waiting for his eyes to burn back at me. \"But why? You hardly know me.\" I asked, lifting my hand slowly towards his that lay in a limp on his leg. \"I don't know, I can't fathom it. It hit me on that day at the bank robbery when I told you that One-Two meant every word to you.\" He replied. \"He said he didn't mean it, that it was all a lie.\" I muttered, feeling a sharp pang of tears threatening to spill down my cheeks. \"It was a lie because he didn't feel it for you, it was me that said those words secretly to Mumbles about you but he stole them.\" That was when he looked directly into my eyes, creating a powerful flame in my soul that I could never put out. \"So why were you gay then?\" I asked, crossing my legs leaning closer to him. \"I started to have feelings for One-Two when we met, Mumbles could easily see it and so could the others apart from him. He was far too interested in girls and getting the deals done than notice me in that way. When we were getting that money back for a top boss that demanded it, I was going to prison for a crime I gladly admit doing. But luckily Archie sorted that out for me in the end.\" I was completly stunned there, he could clearly see that I was uncomfortable about that name but carried on talking. \"Anyway, me and One-Two were heading to our hideout with girls and all that until I told them I only wanted him. He went mental, swearing and shouting at me. I was so ashamed of myself but I couldn't deny what I felt for him. So for one night, we went to a gay bar where we danced together. He promised me never to tell the others but it was clearly obvious that everyone knew and laughed at him because of it. Since then, there's always a bit of anger and rage from him whenever I'm around. I was madly jealous when he went out with Stella after the chaos died down with the top boss and the missing Russian painting. Sooner rather than later, he began to be really nasty and cruel to her. She always came her, in floods of tears, and I quietly comforted her. But when he saw me with her, he flew in a rage once more and she dumped him on the spot giving him a few harsh words that have haunted him since. He hasn't been around women from that time until that night where he met you in that club.\" Swallowing this infomation in, I cleared my throat and prepared to have my say. \"When we met that night, I never thought I could fall in love at first sight but it happened right on that very dancefloor. We danced, our chemisty was so strong and the possiablity of a relationship was high, well probably only for me. But then, he disappeared leaving only his name on a card.\" I explained. Feeling his hand connect with mine, there were sparks flying quietly between us. \"He disappeared because he thought you looked awfully like Stella, willing to open up and fall in love.\" So now I knew the truth, the hate I felt for One-Two was disturbingly starting to cease. \"But why is he so against you being around me?\" I asked, waiting for the outcome. \"Because he too is in love with you, Rose. Can't you see it? The way he burned his eyes at you when I punched him, I noticed it from the moment you couldn't stop looking at each other.\" He replied, sadly. I felt Bob's hand loosen from my grip, a cold air was quickly replaced. Biting down my lip to stop it trembling, my mind was spining around and around so fast I don't think it would ever stop. \"I have to go home.\" I spoke in a broken voice. Bob nodded his head, helpped me off the bed and led us out of the room. We walked past Cookie and Mumbles who were playing a card game, they simply nodded their heads at my direction which I replied back. But once One-Two stood in our way, we stopped. \"Going back to Archie are we? Breaking Bob's heart are we?\" He spoke in a tone I deeply hated. I stared at him, noticing any sign of love his friend had said. Nothing. \"Stand aside, One-Two.\" Bob said, gruffly. He looked at him with a sneer. \"Alright I will but remember, women don't always take it up the bum.\" He warned, sickly. With all my power in me, I spat at his face which made a few people behind me quietly giggle. He wiped it off his sleeve, burning a horrid gaze back at me. \"You disgust me, One-Two. Compeltly.\" I said, coldy. With that, I let go of Bob and left the club on my own. Once the cool air touched me, I slid down the door and silently wept for everything that just happened. It would take me a few minutes until I gathered myself, called a cab and headed back to Archie's place ready for a shouting match. ","Summary":" Sparkles In Your Eyes I Think It's About Time We Need A Good RocknRolla Fic So Here Is Chapter One,"},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Of Hats, Rats, and Mechanical Doohickeys","Author":"JCMorrigan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12147060","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 1. The Tailor's Son Amelia's scream brought Gabriel running across the shop. Which was no small feat, as the course from Point A to Point B was littered with mannequins, half-finished dresses whose hems were easy to get one's feet tangled in, boxes of shoes, and even stray pins that required one to wear shoes at all times on the sales floor lest one wanted to be stabbed. Gabriel didn't know what to expect when he reached the door, where Amelia was frozen in horror. Perhaps it was something as simple as her seeing another rat, though he'd thought he'd chased the last of them out of the shop a while ago. Perhaps she was in some sort of danger, though he couldn't quite imagine what. Or perhaps, terror of terrors, something had happened to the as-of-yet unborn child in her womb. Gabriel was somewhat surprised to find Amelia clutching a mere piece of paper. Her hands shook as her eyes retread the page again and again. \"Amelia?\" Gabriel asked cautiously. \"Amelia, my sweet, what's wrong?\" \"She's dead,\" Amelia replied, her voice barely more than a whisper. \"Who's dead, my sweet?\" Amelia broke down into tears then. \"It's Penelope! She's dead!\" Gabriel went pale. He knew quite well the relationship Amelia had with her aunt Penelope. The old woman had been a mentor and friend to her niece, guiding her through times of trouble. It wasn't surprising for her to have passed, really, Gabriel realized as he reflected. She had been getting on in years quite a bit. Still, it was disconcerting to remember that the last he'd heard from the woman, she was promising to be in town for Amelia's child's Christening. Amelia crossed to a table in the center of the shop, easing herself down onto one of the chairs and laying the letter out on the wood before her. Gabriel wracked his brain for how best to comfort his beloved wife, knowing very little in the world could replace Aunt Penelope for her. In the end, he moved to a chair adjacent to hers, placing his hands on her shoulders, drawing her close as she sobbed. After some time, Amelia stated, \"I want to name the child after her.\" \"I think that would be very fitting, my sweet,\" Gabriel said softly. But then a thought occurred to him: \"What if the child is a boy – \" \"I don't care. After you and the child, she was the most important person to me.\" \"My sweet, you can't name a boy 'Penelope.' They'll jeer at him in the streets – \" \"GABRIEL SPENCER SNATCHER!\" Amelia wrenched herself from her husband's embrace, seizing his shoulders and locking her burning blue eyes onto his. It was then that Gabriel knew there was no arguing left. \"THIS CHILD WILL BEAR MY AUNT'S NAME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER!\" \"…Perhaps the middle name for a boy, then?\" Gabriel suggested meekly. Amelia took a deep breath, thinking it over. \"Yes. A middle name for a boy. That would work.\" Three months later, when the child was born, Gabriel happily signed the boy's legal existence as Archibald Penelope Snatcher. ... Eleven years passed. Two girls gossiped to each other as they walked up the winding sidewalks of Cheesebridge. \"I finished that book about the ugly bell-ringer who never left the church tower,\" one of them began. \"Oh?\" \"And I was thinking…what if that's why Archibald Snatcher never leaves the tailor's shop?\" the girl giggled. \"Because he knows he's so ugly!\" \"I think you missed the point of that book,\" her companion stated, though she had herself a giggle as well. \"We're…not being mean, are we?\" \"How can we be mean about it? He's the TAILOR'S son. It isn't like we're talking about a member of the Guild.\" \"And besides,\" a third voice broke in from directly behind them, \"he's heard it all before, anyway.\" Both girls shrieked and spun to see the subject of their discussion standing right behind them. The eleven-year-old Archibald was clothed in a long coat of brown that day, with several patches he'd sewn in himself. His long, dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail held in place with a single blue ribbon tied in a bow. That day, he carried a roll of fabric hoisted onto one shoulder. In terms of height, he somewhat towered above the pair of girls, and he knew that was making them nervous. He put on his best unnerving smile to let them know he'd heard exactly everything. \"We didn't MEAN it!\" one of the girls squeaked. \"We were just…having a laugh!\" \"We do it to everybody!\" The other was slowly backing away. \"The butcher's daughter, the doctor's son – \" \"Aren't you the butcher's daughter?\" Archibald replied coolly. \"We're sorry!\" the other girl burst out before the pair of them turned and bolted. As they ran, Archibald could hear one of them shrieking, \"He's so CREEPY!\" All Archibald had to offer in reply to this was a roll of the eyes. He really had heard it all before. It was a rare day when he could pass any of his peers and not overhear some crack about his looks or his station. The Snatcher family was renowned throughout town as quality tailors and dressmakers, but there was no pretending this was a high-class position; the family could barely afford basic plumbing for the shop and their living quarters above it. As for Archibald himself, he had inherited his father's pointed nose and crooked teeth as well as his mother's metabolism. He'd spent a good few years wishing it had been the other way around before simply giving up and waving away the whispers this brought him behind his back. Ergo, to say a popular child was more than a gross error. He had literally no friends his own age in all of Cheesebridge. And this, to Archibald, was just fine. He didn't see why he would need any in the first place. \"Oh, Mother!\" he called out, pushing open the door set into the curved, wide-windowed façade of the shop called Snatcher's Stitches. \"Oh, Father! Guess what arrived today!\" Amelia hurried down the stairs from the upstairs quarters while Gabriel stepped in eagerly from the back room. \"The yellow silk!\" Amelia sighed happily. \"We should have Elizabeth's order done within a matter of days,\" Archibald announced. Gabriel shook his head. \"Remember, Archibald – \" Archibald sighed, rolling his eyes yet again. \"I know, I KNOW. Call other men and women, especially those of station, by their surnames. It shows respect.\" \"We'll have MISS BACON'S order completed within a matter of days,\" Gabriel corrected. He stepped forward to clap a hand on his son's shoulder. \"No matter. You'll get it right soon enough. Why don't we get to work?\" Elizabeth Bacon had ordered several grandiose gowns and hats, and all in yellow, which seemed to be her favorite color for reasons that Archibald couldn't even begin to guess, as he found the particular shade putrid. However, when one worked in the business of making clothing for an entire town, one learned quickly there was no accounting for taste. Gabriel, Amelia, and Archibald became a well-oiled machine, cutting lengths of the putrid-colored silk and bringing it around to a triad of mannequins, where they began pinning and stitching. It hadn't taken long at all for Archibald to pick up all the tricks of his parents' trade, and Amelia and Gabriel trusted him fully to put together orders with grace and precision. As he wrapped cloth over his assigned mannequin, Archibald glanced over a sheet of Miss Bacon's measurements. It struck him that she had a very particular figure. She was short, and somewhat rounded in the midsection, though with gangly limbs. This struck him as familiar, and he stored the information away for later use. ... Dinner that night was rather meager, though the promise of the Bacon order brought with it a future of more splendid meals to come. Amelia laid the table out quickly, hoping she'd vetted the food well enough. Avoiding using dairy in day-to-day meals had become routine, but Amelia still worried about being too careless one day and missing something. She'd never quite gotten over the fright that had been instilled within her when she discovered the hard way that her son had quite a violent allergy. And as it did every night, the worry crossed her mind that young Archibald wouldn't be able to make it in a town that based its economy upon cheese. She forced such thoughts away and focused on placing the silverware. \"I tell you,\" Gabriel announced as he strode into the room, \"the Bacon order is just the beginning! Once the rest of them see the splendor of her gowns, they'll come flocking to Snatcher's Stitches in droves, and we'll find ourselves with more work than we know what to do with!\" He took a seat, with Archibald following suit right beside him. \"And then, it will finally happen!\" \"Yes, dear.\" Amelia nodded. She knew what was coming, and sat down across the table from her husband and son. \"After all,\" Gabriel began, unaware that Archibald, having committed this particular speech to memory, was lip-syncing it next to him, complete with overblown hand gestures, \"hard work is the route to a White Hat! Those who put in the time and patience will surely be rewarded, and soon, I will have the honor of being invited into the one and only Tasting Room to discuss matters of urgency and town betterment among kindred minds! …Amelia, my sweet, is something wrong?\" Amelia bit her lip to stifle a giggle from Archibald's mockery. \"Nothing. Nothing at all!\" \"It's going to happen,\" Gabriel insisted. \"And soon. I know it will. Then we'll live like a king, queen, and prince.\" Amelia had become disillusioned a long time ago. Gabriel had been saying the same thing since before Archibald was born, always insisting that the time he was to be named to the elite council of White Hats was \"soon.\" Always \"soon.\" Amelia was sure by now that the White Hats didn't care, not about a tailor. No matter how hard Gabriel worked, he would never have the lineage or the wealth. She wondered how Archibald felt when year after year, Gabriel's prediction of joining the upper class failed to come true. In truth, the boy was only just beginning to become disillusioned as well, as much as he wished ever so much that Gabriel would one year be correct. ... On his way toward his bedchamber, Archibald became aware of a disturbance in the hallway. Something was making an awful racket, squeaking and clanking in the corner. Since that was where Gabriel had set up a cage-style trap for rats, Archibald had a fair guess of what was making the noise. Kneeling, he spied a rat rapidly clawing at the walls of the cage, trying to free itself in vain. \"Well, hello there,\" he said softly. \"What sort of trouble have you gotten into, then?\" Amelia, passing, began to ask, \"Archibald, what are you looking at – \" Then her eyes lit upon the tiny prisoner. \"RAT!\" she screeched, loudly enough for the neighbors to hear. \"IT'S A RAT!\" Gabriel came rushing into the hallway. \"We caught a rat?\" \"GET RID OF IT!\" Amelia shrieked, pointing with a shaking finger at the trap. \"GET RID OF IT RIGHT NOW! THAT UGLY, DISGUSTING THING DOESN'T BELONG HERE!\" \"At once!\" Gabriel nodded. \"Archibald, stand aside.\" \"You're…going to kill it, aren't you?\" Archibald replied. \"Yes,\" Gabriel affirmed. \"It's a filthy thing that needs to be removed. Now, stand aside or hand me the trap.\" \"No!\" Archibald stood, clutching the trap tightly. \"Don't kill it!\" \"Archibald,\" Gabriel said sternly. \"Please see sense. That rat will make us all diseased.\" \"I want to keep it.\" Archibald fixed a glare upon his father that he'd inherited from his mother, one that warned Gabriel that an impasse was forthcoming. \"Maybe,\" Amelia said shakingly, \"so long as it stays in your room…and doesn't leave…and you take good care of it…you can keep it.\" Gabriel relaxed a bit; if Amelia was willing to let Archibald protect the rat, he had less of a reason to destroy the creature. \"Can I really?\" Archibald looked at his mother with a not-too-often-seen expression of joy. \"IF IT STAYS IN YOUR ROOM,\" Amelia reiterated. \"Thank you, Mother!\" Archibald replied happily. He turned his attention to the trap's prisoner: \"I think I'll call you Framley. That's a good name for a rat, is it not?\" Perhaps he didn't find the concept of friendship so useless after all. ... Within a few days, Elizabeth Bacon's gowns were finished. The final touches were placed upon the last putrid-yellow confection in the evening, and it was decided that Miss Bacon would be informed of the readiness of her gowns the following morning. With that, the Snatcher trinity packed up their sewing needles and seam rippers and made way for their beds. Though Archibald lingered, looking back at the gowns, particularly one that had been accented with blue and given a series of flamboyant ruffles. The fact of the matter was that Elizabeth Bacon, through some twist of fate, was roughly Archibald's size and shape. And this was something that had lingered on his mind for a while, though he couldn't quite explain to himself why. He moved halfway up the stairs before hearing the door of his parents' room click closed, then, overcome by curiosity over the connection he'd made, he crept back down toward the mannequins. The yellow and blue number wasn't really so bad after all. Perhaps \"putrid\" had been too strong of a word. It was actually somewhat beautiful. And it would probably look all the more beautiful on someone. As the thought formed in Snatcher's mind, he knew his parents wouldn't approve of it. He knew absolutely no one would approve of it. But his curiosity was overcoming him, and it was such an enticing gown. Before he could talk himself out of it, he'd whipped the yellow and blue silk gown from its resting place, being very careful not to fold or crease it as he smuggled it up the stairs. His parents were still shut in their chamber, leaving Archibald an unimpeded route to his own room. He quickly scurried inside, closing and locking the door. In a few short moments, his prior clothes lay discarded on the floor, and he was draped in the yellow and blue silk, admiring himself in the mirror. Short as Miss Bacon was, she was still taller than an eleven-year-old child, and the hem of the skirt pooled a bit around Archibald's feet, but otherwise, the dress fit as though it had been fated. On a table on the opposite side of the room, Framley had been set up with a small living cage, provided with food, water, and spare fabric to make a bed out of. \"What do you think, Framley?\" Archibald asked the rodent, giving an experimental twirl in front of the glass and watching as the fabric billowed out. Framley just made a clicking noise. \"Right,\" Archibald stated. \"The hair doesn't quite work. Perhaps if I…\" He loosed his ponytail, teasing his hair atop his head and tying it into a messy updo with the ribbon. \"Better?\" he asked Framley. The rat made no response. \"Better,\" Archibald decided. \"You know, Framley, I might even call myself beautiful.\" And he gave the mirror an honest smile. The smile quickly faded; \"The hair's still not working. Perhaps with one of the hats…Framley, I'll be back.\" He crept out of the room, avoiding the steps that creaked on his way down to retrieve one of the hats commissioned for Miss Bacon. One in particular, a yellow sun hat tied round with a blue ribbon, caught his eye. He quickly crossed to it, flipped it once in his hands, and then settled it on his head. Archibald then turned to hustle his way back to his room and the mirror only to be stopped short by the sight of his father on the stairs. He was frozen, staring in shock at Gabriel, and Gabriel's reaction was much the same, though Archibald was sure Gabriel's heart wasn't threatening to beat its way right out of its rib cage the way Archibald's was. \"Archibald,\" Gabriel said, and Archibald could hear the anger slowly bubbling up behind his voice. Archibald tried to think of an excuse, something to talk his way out of the situation he'd just been caught in, but no words came. When Gabriel spoke next, it was an absolute growl: \"There are things that men…men of status, or men who wish to be men of status…don't do. There are things that men don't do at all. And men do not wear women's garments.\" \"Understood,\" Archibald replied hoarsely. \"I don't know why you decided to do this,\" Gabriel continued, \"but you're going to put it all back the way you found it. And I am never going to see you dressed in such a manner again. Is that clear?\" \"Very clear, father.\" \"Well, then.\" Gabriel searched for words and failed. \"Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight, father.\" Gabriel turned and made his way up the stairs, and Archibald returned to his room to change out of the gown and put it back the way he found it. He knew very well that there were rules about what men did and did not do, and he in no way wanted to threaten his father's chance for a White Hat…or, as far off as it seemed, the dream that Archibald might one day wear his own. Still, it wasn't every day he actually found himself pretty.[Chapter 2] 2. A Night Out and a Blunder or Two Roughly two months after Archibald Snatcher turned thirteen, so did one young master Charles Portley-Rind, the son of the most influential and wealthy family in Cheesebridge and heir to the leadership position of the Cheese Guild. Normally, when such an event happened, it passed by the working and lower classes completely, reserved only for the rich and the famous. However, in an attempt to \"remind this town that our family cares about the lowborn, even if not as much as the well-bred, of course,\" in young Charles' own words, invitations went out to families of all classes to attend a party hosted by the Cheese Guild and sponsored by the White Hats. Children ages ten to fifteen would be given the run of the ballroom to socialize with Charles while adults would gather in other parts of the stately Portley-Rind manor. \"This is it!\" Gabriel crowed, waving the invitation in the air. \"This is how we get our foot in the door, Amelia! When we arrive and remind the Portley-Rinds of how much we have contributed to this town, we'll be under consideration for the next White Hat for sure!\" \"Of course, dear.\" Amelia nodded routinely. Gabriel didn't even notice how hollow the gesture was. Amelia addressed her son next: \"Archibald, you'll want to look your best. We don't want to make a bad impression on the Portley-Rinds and their friends.\" \"But of course!\" Archibald nodded his agreement. \"I can have something ready in time for the party.\" From then until the event, he spent his time working on repairing some of his old garments and combining them with a freshly sewn waistcoat. At the end of it all, he turned up one very smart suit that was primarily bright crimson, one of the two colors he thought suited him best. ... \"Now remember,\" Gabriel told his son as the three Snatchers made their way up to the Portley-Rind residence in the late evening, \"young Master Portley-Rind barely knows you. You must treat him with decorum. Shake his hand, look him in the eye, and wish him many happy returns.\" \"Of course,\" Archibald replied. \"I'm not stupid. I know how this works.\" \"And Archibald, dear,\" Amelia said cautiously, \"not to judge, but, erm, perhaps you've had enough to eat for the night? You'd best, er, leave whatever cheese they have out for the other guests. You wouldn't want to look a glutton. You….you also don't want you-know-what to happen.\" \"It only happens SOMEtimes,\" Archibald argued. This was a lie. \"Still…\" \"All right, Mother, all right.\" The doorman opened up the entryway to where the young guests populated the ballroom. It was easy to tell who had come from what sort of family. While many of the children wore formal wear that was slightly shabby, others were decked out in lavish suits and multilayered ballgowns. Archibald caught himself wondering just how many of these pieces had been worked on by his very own family; he thought he recognized a few articles. \"Mr. and Mrs. Snatcher,\" the doorman addressed, gesturing to a side door leading to where the adults had gathered. \"This way, if you please.\" Archibald was left alone in the sea of young guests, keeping to the walls as he observed the room. Most everyone in it, he realized, he recognized as someone he'd caught whispering about him behind his back. Not a good sign, he thought, for someone poised to be the son of the next White Hat. Though perhaps when that happened, if it happened, everything would change, and every idle gossiper would find himself or herself eating words. Until then, Archibald played a game of who-said-what: this boy here had assumed Archibald was a \"sissy\" for refusing to join in neighborhood ball games, that girl there had made another comparison of him to a horror novel monster, that boy there had wondered out loud exactly what his mother had done to produce such a \"disgusting-looking\" child. If it weren't for the goal of keeping up appearances for Charles, wherever he was, Archibald would certainly have regretted showing up at all. Where was Charles, anyhow? Archibald had never met him in person, and wondered what exactly he looked like. He knew that a Portley-Rind son would be dressed all in white, with flaming red hair. The Portley-Rinds had run Cheesebridge for generations, for better or for worse, and not a one of the bloodline had been anything other than a redhead. Archibald wondered about Charles' demeanor, as well. Obviously, he had to carry himself with grace and good form. Was he a kind boy, or a rude one? One would hope that the heir to the most prominent position in town was good-hearted. Many of the guests were dancing, and Archibald noted a clear separation: the more well-dressed kept to each other as partners, and those less financially fortunate were left to dance with each other. No one approached Archibald to ask him to dance; he wouldn't have wanted to anyway. If he disgusted this lot this much, he figured, well, then they disgusted him right back. Still, every so often, one of them would recognize him (\"You're the tailor's son, aren't you?\") and approach for a greeting, either because it was the routine thing to do in the name of good manners or to silently mock Archibald. Not even staying close to the wall made for a safe hiding place, and he was forced to follow along with the great charade and shake this boy's hand, kiss that girl's hand, shake that boy's hand, kiss that girl's hand. \"If I may have your attention!\" The voice that sounded from the top of the stairs at the far end of the room was authoritative, even if immature in timbre. \"Yes, yes, I would like to thank you all very much for coming to my party, and I hope that you are enjoying the evening!\" Archibald turned his gaze to the stairway, beholding Charles Portley-Rind for the first time, and his heart seized up. \"If you please,\" Charles continued, \"I will now be taking your well-wishes.\" The dancers all ceased, lining up in an orderly row to wish Charles happy returns one by one. Archibald found himself swept into the crowd, though one of the last in line. All the while, his mind raced. Charles was an incredibly handsome boy, decked out in an impeccable white ensemble. His well-defined facial features were offset by the coiffed mane of red that the Portley-Rinds were so famous for. Archibald couldn't take his eyes off of the boy. Charles was the most beautiful person he'd ever beheld. There was a certain sort of man, Archibald knew, who did not pursue women in romance, but instead chased after other men. To be one of these men, he had been taught, was one of the worst sins a man could commit. Such a man would never see employment in town, let alone have a chance for the coveted White Hat. And so he had resolved not to be one, thinking it an easy enough task. While he never had found a girl he fancied, he chalked that up to the simple fact that most of them would rather make fun of him than approach him in so much as a friendly manner. Now he was struck with a fear that he'd somehow slipped up, for as the line moved him closer to Charles, he was undeniably drawn to the fire-haired boy, and he couldn't quite drive the thought out of his mind that Charles was gorgeous. How was no one else able to hear how loudly his heart was beating? And a good thing, too, or he would have been given away. Archibald steeled himself to be cool as he approached Charles, prepared not to betray the treasonous feelings that were taking him over. As they stood face-to-face, Charles flashed him a sincere smile, which Archibald returned. A boy with a smile like that couldn't be bad, could he? Archibald found himself wanting to wish him well with great honesty. Charles offered his hand, and Archibald took hold of it and politely kissed it before beginning, \"Master Portley-Rind, I wish you many happy returns on this, the day of your bi – \" Charles withdrew his hand as though it had been bitten by a snake. \"I say, did you just KISS my hand?\" A chill overtook Archibald. That was exactly what he had done, without even thinking about it. Was it because of the feelings of attraction toward Charles he wished he wasn't having? Or was it a mere mistake, caused by a fluctuation of routine, trying to keep track of whose hand to shake and whose to kiss? Whatever the cause, he knew he had to cover for it, and quickly. \"Apologies!\" He forced a smile. \"A mere error, Master Portley-Rind! Can't be the first one to have mixed that one up, can I?\" \"The first I've known,\" Charles replied. \"You aren't one of those queer boys, are you?\" \"Not at all,\" Archibald denied. \"I suppose now's the time to admit I had been planning that one from the start as a jest. After all, what is life without a little levity?\" \"Levity!\" Charles laughed. \"I should say you've brought it! To think I've had my hand kissed by…who are you again?\" \"Archibald Snatcher,\" Archibald answered, thoroughly aware that giving away his identity would lead to disaster but unaware of what else he could do given the situation. \"The tailor's son!\" Charles crowed. \"I hope you should all forgive me if I go and give my hand a thorough wash before returning to the festivities!\" Archibald blanched. \"Oh, don't think you've lost all honor,\" Charles said in a mock reassuring tone. \"After all, you've got the honor of the most unattractive person to have attempted to court me!\" The entire ballroom erupted into laughter. This wasn't happening. \"For the last time, Master Portley-Rind,\" Archibald said sternly. \"I was not trying to – \" \"Oh, I know, I know,\" Charles guffawed. \"Why don't you go back to the dance floor? Perhaps you can find a handsome young boy to ask you to dance!\" The laughter grew louder. So this was the demeanor of Charles Portley-Rind, Archibald concluded. Absolutely unkind and without compassion. Why had he expected differently? After all, it was only fitting to match everyone else in the room. \"I've just remembered,\" Archibald stated. \"I've somewhere very important to be.\" \"More important than my birthday?\" Charles retorted. \"Now I know you're just trying to save face.\" \"I've left an order unfinished for a wealthier lord from London,\" Archibald lied. \"Couldn't very well have it fail to ship out tomorrow when he needs it for his wedding, could I?\" All the while, he was making his way back toward the door. \"You'd be a fool to leave at this time of night,\" Charles said sternly. \"After all, the Boxtrolls may have come out of hiding.\" At this statement, a hush fell over the room. Every child feared the Boxtrolls and their unpredictable behavior. \"They could eat you right up,\" Charles continued…and then could not hold back from breaking out into a great smile: \"Though that might be doing this town a bit of a favor, don't you think?\" As the loudest laughter yet erupted from the room, Archibald slammed the door, closing himself out onto the front stoop. From there, he stormed into the street so he could plan out what to do next. Inside the ballroom, one boy, also aged thirteen and wearing a waistcoat of blue, wasn't laughing, and he hadn't been since the incident had begun. In fact, as soon as Archibald left, he reached over and tugged the sleeve of the boy next to him. \"You shouldn't have laughed,\" he chastised. \"Oh, really?\" the other boy, a Guild member's child known as Westerly Hanson, replied. \"It's only that Snatcher peasant. What difference does it make?\" \"If he is the tailor's son,\" the first boy insisted, \"then he's very important to this town. We're all probably wearing things he helped make, and as everyone's clothes are so fine, I think he must do a good job. Besides, why should we laugh at him for kissing Charles' hand?\" \"You mean Master Portley-Rind,\" Westerly corrected. \"It's rather arbitrary, isn't it?\" the boy went on as though he hadn't heard. \"Shake a man's hand and kiss a woman's. Who decided upon that rule, anyhow? Hm. I do hope Archibald is all right. Is no one going to go after him? Well, then, I will!\" \"Boxtrolls will eat you,\" Westerly cautioned, though, looking this boy over, it was clear from his dress that he, too, was lower class…and were those burn marks on his pant legs? He realized he wouldn't mind if the Boxtrolls gobbled this one up as well. \"Boxtrolls don't scare me!\" the boy said with a broad smile before making his way to the door. On the way, he passed the buffet table, where all sorts of expensive cheeses had been set out for the party guests to eat. He had the feeling that after public ridicule, Archibald might not be in the mood to talk to anyone, so he'd best take some food with him as a peace offering. Outside the building, Archibald paced back and forth as he contemplated his next move. He supposed that having made up such an elaborate lie, he should go back home to complete the illusion. However, on the other hand, what if there was a chance for him to save face? He'd just made a fool of himself out of the son of the chief White Hat, and there was no telling what disgrace that would bring his entire family. If he could fix it, then he absolutely had to. The door to the manor opened, and a short, slender and dark-haired boy clad in a blue waistcoat and sorch-marked pants slipped out onto the street, a plate of cheese in hand. \"Archibald Snatcher?\" he greeted tentatively. \"What do YOU want?\" Archibald snapped. \"I only wanted to see if you were all right,\" the boy said softly. \"It wasn't fair, the way they made fun of you in there. You didn't do anything wrong. They always do that, you know. Make fun of people for the silliest reasons. It's very rude of them.\" Was this some sort of trick? \"If you've come to ridicule me as well,\" Archibald growled, \"you can leave.\" \"But I didn't!\" the boy protested. \"I just know how awful I'd feel if they'd made fun of me. Well, all right, I've learned to ignore them for the most part, but sometimes it's too much to bear all the same. And I'm sorry.\" \"For what? You didn't do anything.\" \"I know,\" the boy insisted, \"but I'm still sorry they laughed at you. Here!\" He held out the plate of cheese. \"I thought you might want something to eat, and you wouldn't feel much like going back in through that crowd to get it.\" Archibald eyed the plate, then looked up at the boy. His better judgment told him this was some sort of joke. No one ever acted this sympathetic toward him without some sort of punchline. But he wanted to believe this boy had better intentions. He just wanted something to go right this night. His eyes traveled back down to the plate. He knew exactly what his mother would say. But he'd just been offered the cheese in a gesture of friendship, and turning that down would be yet another faux pas. Besides, he thought, it was entirely likely that nothing would happen to him this time if he indulged. So he said \"Thank you\" and took a bite. ... The next thing he remembered was waking up in his bed, fully clothed in his mostly-red suit. Gabriel was depositing a swollen leech into a bucket on the bedside table while Amelia looked on in horror. \"…What happened?\" Archibald managed to ask groggily. \"Oh, thank the Lord, you're all right…\" Amelia sighed. \"We, er…we had to leave the party early,\" Gabriel stated softly. \"What time is it?\" Archibald asked, dreading the answer. \"We only made it home a while ago,\" Gabriel replied. So he'd had one of his fits after all. Archibald couldn't imagine what that had done to his family's social standing. Before any further discussion could occur, the doorbell jingled, indicating someone had entered the shop. A thin voice called out, \"Hello? Is anyone there?\" \"A customer?\" Amelia wondered out loud. \"This late?\" Archibald followed his parents down the stairs to find the boy with the burn marks on his clothes standing in the middle of the sales floor. \"Are you…\" the boy began before catching sight of Archibald. \"Oh, you're all right!\" He immediately flushed; \"I'm so very, terribly, INCREDIBLY sorry! I didn't mean to…I didn't know you would…\" \"It's all right,\" Amelia told the boy. Teeth gritted, Archibald stepped out in front of him. \"You have nothing to apologize for,\" he insisted, \"because nothing of consequence happened.\" \"Nothing of consequence?\" the boy repeated. \"But you'd swollen up like a balloon, and were turning all sorts of colors! I was afraid you'd perish right in front of - \" \"That,\" Archibald interrupted, \"couldn't POSSIBLY have happened.\" \"But…\" The boy looked up to see the apologetic look on Gabriel and Amelia's faces. He began to piece together what should and shouldn't be spoken of. \"I'm…sorry for bringing that up too.\" \"You needn't be,\" Archibald insisted, \"because there's NOTHING NOT TO BRING UP.\" \"Understood,\" the boy said with a nod. \"Anyhow, it…it seems you're all right, so I won't keep you.\" He turned to leave. \"Wait.\" The boy halted, looking back at Archibald. No one outside of the Snatcher family had ever seemed to care that much about Archibald's well-being before. And Archibald couldn't well ignore that. Unaware that he was about to make his first real friend, he asked, \"What's your name?\" \"It's Herbert,\" the boy answered cheerily. \"Herbert Trubshaw.\"[Chapter 3] 3. The Escapades of Friends A dark night had fallen over the town of Cheesebridge. Yet the young Archibald Snatcher was not asleep, lying in his bed and staring up at the ceiling of his room. The notes of a new song had gotten into his head, and he wanted to try and put lyrics to it before it went away. Between this rather noisy train of thought and the sounds of Framley scuttling about in his cage across the room, Archibald completely missed the tiny patter of the pebble that bounced against his window. What he did not miss was the larger rock that completely shattered the glass, coming to rest unceremoniously on the carpet among glittering shards. Archibald hastened to the window to see the source of the rock. It could only have been one of two things: a ne'er-do-well, or… \"Sorry!\" Herbert Trubshaw hissed up at him from the street below. \"Trubshaw!\" Archibald hissed back. \"What do you think you're doing?\" \"I didn't mean to break your window.\" \"Why are you HERE? The Boxtrolls are out at this time of night, you know! Do you want to get eaten up!\" \"I keep telling you!\" Herbert insisted. \"Boxtrolls don't scare me! And I've just had a breakthrough working on a new project, and I wanted to show you!\" \"At THIS hour?\" \"It is pretty late, isn't it?\" Herbert admitted. \"It's all right. You can just come and look at it tomorrow.\" \"No, no…\" Archibald sighed. \"Give me a moment. I'm coming down.\" His fear of the fabled Boxtrolls was secondary to his curiosity about whatever adventure Herbert had in mind for him. He quickly changed from nightgown to street clothes, then scurried down the stairs, avoiding those that squeaked, and slipped out the front door of Snatcher's Stitches. \"I'm quite excited to show you!\" Herbert said in a hushed tone as soon as Archibald was in closer range. \"Can't you tell me what exact sort of…mechanical doohickey you've come up with now?\" Archibald asked somewhat pleadingly. \"No, no, no!\" Herbert insisted. \"I have to SHOW you! Come on!\" He took off at a run down the street, which happened to be uphill. \"Trubshaw!\" Archibald gave chase. \"Trubshaw, you know I can't run that fast! TRUBSHAW!\" Herbert had the mind to halt and wait for Archibald to catch up some blocks down the road. \"Now,\" Archibald huffed as he finally reached Herbert, \"if we could proceed at a more…sensible pace…\" \"I'm just excited!\" Herbert bubbled. \"So you've said,\" Archibald replied with a smile. The pair had become fast friends ever since the night of Charles Portley-Rind's thirteenth birthday. Over the next couple of months, they were scarcely seen apart, unless Archibald was caught up helping his family with business or Herbert was locked away working on another of his projects. Of course, this had only spurred on rumors about the two of them. Given the gossip that had already been circulating about Archibald, the rest of their peers in Cheesebridge figured that the only reason he and Herbert could be so close was if they were secretly romantically involved. Yet they stood apart, invincible to rumors. They had each other, so what did it matter what anyone else thought? As they walked briskly toward the destination Herbert had in mind, Herbert asked, \"So have you come up with anything new creative in your corner of the world? Written any more poems?\" \"They're not POEMS, Trubshaw,\" Archibald corrected. \"They're SONGS. There's a difference!\" \"You can call me by my first name, you know,\" Herbert broke in. They both knew Archibald wouldn't; he simply couldn't break the habit. It was simply Herbert's habit to suggest it whenever they met up. \"Or 'Trubshaw' is fine, too. So have you written any more songs?\" \"I was working on one before you broke my window,\" Archibald informed him. \"Still sorry about that.\" \"No need to be.\" \"Can I hear it? The song you were working on.\" \"It's still a work in progress,\" Archibald admitted, \"but here's how it goes so far.\" He sang softly, so as not to wake anyone or attract the attention of any nearby trolls: \"There's a broken stopwatch in my chest. I think it ticks too fast. And every time it ticks, I know I won't forever last. Though I have flight of fancy dreams that would have made for tales most tall, the chiming of the clock reminds me I won't live them all…\" The song took up the rest of the duration of the walk to the alley where Herbert's project lay in hiding. At its conclusion, Herbert reviewed, \"It's a bit morbid, but it's quite beautiful all the same.\" \"Of course it is,\" Archibald replied slyly. \"I wrote it, after all! But in all seriousness, thank you. Now, what have we got here?\" \"The 'mechanical doohickey,'\" Herbert replied. \"Now. Try and contain your excitement!\" \"Trubshaw, you've built up so much suspense around this contraption, it's difficult to contain anything!\" \"Right! Now, behold…THIS!\" Herbert ducked behind a crate and brought out a small object wrapped in a sheet. He made a show of whipping off the sheet with the grandest flourish he could muster. \"It's…a small wagon,\" Archibald observed. \"It runs on a little engine I designed myself!\" Herbert boasted, setting the tiny vehicle on the street and pressing a button. The small vehicle propelled itself across the cobblestone for a few feet before catching on a rough patch and toppling onto its side. \"Very impressive!\" Archibald gave the display a round of soft applause. \"That was just the opening act,\" Herbert informed him. \"The real show is this way!\" He stepped back further into the alley, where an even larger sheet was draped over an object the size of fifteen crates. \"Trubshaw,\" Archibald commented, \"you didn't…\" \"I DID!\" Herbert whipped the sheet off the much larger device. \"Voilà!\" The great wooden wagon was cobbled together out of different planks and parts; none of the four wheels seemed to have come from the same object. An armchair was mounted to the top of it like a throne. Pipes protruding from the wagon hinted at the engine within. Archibald was awestruck. \"I can't believe you actually made all that.\" \"I…had a little help,\" Herbert admitted. \"Help?\" This confused Archibald. He didn't know of any friends Herbert had besides him. \"Who helped you with all this?\" \"It doesn't matter,\" Herbert said quickly. \"Want to take it for a ride?\" \"Is it safe?\" \"I don't know! We'll have to find out!\" Herbert was already climbing onto the back of the wagon, gesturing to the armchair. \"Times like these, I wish I could argue with you,\" Archibald muttered under his breath as he clambered up to settle into the armchair. Herbert threw a lever, and they were off, the wagon chugging its way down the alley. It got to the other end and turned onto the street before the engine died with a loud whine and the two left-side wheels broke down – and a lucky thing, too, or gravity might have carried the wagon all the way downhill until it crashed into something. \"I suppose it still needs work,\" Herbert sighed. The two boys climbed off the wagon and began the laborious task of putting it back in the alley despite its two missing wheels. \"I'm quite aware you'll have it in working order in very little time,\" Archibald stated. \"I can see it now. You'll be wheeling all around town in this…whatchamacallit, calling out advertisement for your many inventions, and that's how you'll get your own White Hat to go with the one I'm going to have.\" \"You know I don't care about hats, Archibald,\" Herbert laughed. \"How can you not care about hats?\" Archibald replied, somewhat stunned. \"Don't you want to be a man of worth?\" \"Yes I do, Archibald, but I can do that without a hat that tells me what I should be! And so can you!\" Archibald shook his head. \"When I get mine, I'll still put in a word for you.\" \"If you should get one and I don't, I don't mind,\" Herbert admitted. \"I quite like that idea you had of driving around town in my wagon and helping people by building and fixing things.\" They managed to settle the wagon back down and cover it up with the sheet. \"It's quite late,\" Archibald realized, somewhat nervous. \"We'd best both get home before we meet with terrible fates. You live close by, don't you?\" \"Perhaps we should go to your home first,\" Herbert suggested. \"Why my home? You live closer.\" \"I just thought…\" Herbert knew Archibald wouldn't take it well if Herbert called him out on being more afraid of what came out after sundown than Herbert was, and would benefit more from having the company. \"…Oh, never mind. It didn't really make sense.\" They left the alley together, making their way through the labyrinth of back roads. No other human was around, but Archibald could feel eyes on him from the dark corners of the alleys. They were there, he knew it, and they were probably sizing up which of the boys would taste better… It caught him off guard when a Boxtroll actually stepped cautiously out into the street, holding one of the wheels that had popped off the wagon and offering it out toward Herbert. Herbert was already reaching for the wheel with a smile when Archibald threw himself between Herbert and the troll, arms spread out, forming as much of a wall as he could. \"YOU WON'T BE EATING HIM ON MY WATCH!\" he roared at the troll, who quailed and shuffled backward. \"Herbert, RUN!\" \"Er…Archibald…\" Herbert said nervously. \"Perhaps now's a good time to tell you that – \" \"Do you WANT to be eaten? RUN!\" \"Archibald, Shoe isn't going to attack us.\" \"Who in the WORLD is…\" Realization struck. He looked back over his shoulder at Herbert, then in front of them, at the tiny troll clad in a cardboard box displaying a picture of an effeminate shoe. \"Trubshaw,\" Archibald said slowly, deliberately, \"what is going on here?\" Herbert stepped around him, extending a hand to the Boxtroll. \"I'm sorry about all that,\" he said softly. \"I haven't told him about you yet. All he knows is the stories. Thank you for finding my wheel.\" The Boxtroll said something in return, in a language Archibald couldn't make heads or tails of, and handed the wheel off to Herbert. \"Is Fish around?\" Herbert asked, glancing into the side streets. When he spied what appeared to be an ordinary abandoned cardboard box, this one decorated with a fish-shaped emblem, he called out, \"It's all right! Archibald is a friend! He won't hurt you! Come on out; I want him to meet you!\" The box seemed to sprout arms, legs, and a head. Archibald transitioned from surprise into flat-out bewilderment as a second Boxtroll left the security of the side street and came to stand next to Shoe. When Herbert turned back to Archibald, his expression was almost apologetic. \"I want you to meet my friends,\" he introduced. \"Shoe and Fish.\" He turned back to the trolls; \"Fish, Shoe, this is Archibald.\" And then back: \"Shoe and Fish have helped me build a lot of things. And I've helped them build things, too.\" \"When you said you had help with the machine…\" Archibald realized. \"It was them,\" Herbert confirmed. \"They're not like what the stories say at all, Archibald.\" \"They're not cannibalistic thieves?\" \"Good heavens, no! They'd never dream of eating one of us! And they only take what they're sure other people don't want! They don't have much for themselves, after all!\" \"You always said Boxtrolls didn't scare you,\" Archibald recalled. \"When we first met,\" Herbert recalled, \"I realized they were just as scared of me as I was of them.\" \"And when was THIS?\" \"Since before I knew you.\" Fish stepped forward and tugged on Herbert's sleeve, telling him something. Herbert nodded. \"He says he's glad to meet you,\" Herbert translated. Shoe asked a question, to which Herbert replied, \"No, he's not much of a builder. He writes poems – \" \"SONGS,\" Archibald insisted. \"Songs, sorry,\" Herbert amended. \"And they're beautiful songs, too.\" Herbert took a moment to look around at his three friends. \"We're all just a bunch of misfits, is what we are,\" he realized. \"But that's all right.\" ... After the trolls had parted ways with the human boys, Archibald ended up accompanying Herbert back to his home, then walking back to the tailor's shop alone. He wasn't afraid of the night anymore. Herbert had proven it didn't hold anything to fear. And when he lay back down to bed, it took him quite a while to get to sleep. It wasn't every day that you learned your best friend's other best friends were the creatures children were warned about by parents. It wasn't every day that you learned that such myths of bloodthirst were baseless. It was simply a lot to think about. ... The town became blanketed in snow, and nearly all of its citizens began to walk with an extra spring in their step at the idea that Christmas was coming. It was, in fact, the first Christmas that Archibald was actually looking forward to. He'd never seen the appeal in the holiday, but now he had a friend to share it with. He and Herbert had planned to exchange gifts before heading down to the frozen river to skate. With a small wrapped box in hand, Archibald stepped out of the shop door on his way to the designated rendez-vous place only to find Herbert approaching already, carrying a much larger box that was crudely wrapped, the paper torn in places. \"I know we said we'd meet halfway,\" Herbert grunted, struggling to keep the box held up, \"but your gift ended up being heavier than I expected, and I didn't want you to have to walk far.\" \"You didn't have to go overboard with it!\" Archibald replied, now overcome with curiosity as to what exactly Herbert had for him. \"I hope you don't mind if I set it down a moment…\" Herbert kicked a patch of street clear of snow before kneeling to place the box. \"Here.\" Archibald handed over the gift he carried. \"Open yours first.\" Herbert eagerly took the box into his own hands, ripping away the paper and ribbon to discover a pair of thick brown leather gloves. Experimentally, he pulled the right one on; it fit just perfectly. \"Archibald!\" His face lit up. \"I don't know what to say!\" \"We had a large order of leather gloves, and there was a pair left over,\" Archibald explained. \"Thought you might want something to protect from burns while working on your doohickeys.\" \"I absolutely love them!\" Herbert gushed, now wearing both gloves. \"All right, it's your turn! I can't wait to see what you think!\" He hoisted up the large box. \"We should probably take it indoors and open it on a table if it's so heavy,\" Archibald suggested. \"Good thinking!\" Herbert agreed. Inside the shop, the boys set the gift box down upon a spare table, and Archibald delicately peeled the paper off of it. \"I've been working on it for a while,\" Herbert blurted before the gift could be revealed. \"This…is something you made?\" Archibald responded, somewhat taken aback. Herbert nodded enthusiastically. The box was opened, and it took Archibald a moment to register what he was actually looking at. He lifted it out of its container, setting it down on the table. \"It's a sewing machine!\" Herbert explained. \"A bit of a small one, but I thought you could use it for your work and for other things, too.\" Archibald stared in awe at the machine, unsure of what to say. \"Archibald?\" Herbert asked worriedly. \"Is…it all right? Or don't you like it?\" \"I…love it,\" Archibald answered honestly. To bequeath him something like this was a gesture of extreme magnitude that he hadn't expected, not even from his best friend. How many hours of hard work, how many trials and errors, had gone into its creation? And did this mean Archibald should tell Herbert the truth about the gloves? In the end, he simply said, \"I'll take it up to my room. Then we can make our way to the river.\" Lifting it up, he gave Herbert a direct look in the eye; \"Thank you, Trubshaw.\" \"No need to thank me!\" Herbert replied. \"It's Christmas!\" As Archibald carried the precious device up the stairs to his chamber, Amelia appeared from the back storage room. \"Herbert Trubshaw!\" she greeted. \"I had thought you and Archibald were going down to the river! Would you like a cup of tea?\" \"No thank you,\" Herbert told Amelia. \"We're heading to the river soon. How has business been?\" \"Rather slow,\" Amelia admitted. \"What about the glove order? That must have taken some work.\" \"What glove order?\" Amelia was baffled. \"Didn't you have to fill a great order of leather gloves?\" Herbert asked. Amelia shook her head. \"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. I do know Archibald had been getting invested in leather work lately. He's spent the past two months trying to make a single pair of leather gloves. Don't tell him I told you this, but he had to start over several times, and there was a lot of cursing involved. Leather is a finicky material to work with, after all.\" That was when Herbert realized what had really happened. He wasn't wearing a pair of leftover gloves after all. He had been happy with them all the same, but he looked at them anew, through the new knowledge that they were the result of two months' hard work. \"Trubshaw!\" Archibald's voice interrupted his reverie. \"We'd best get a move on!\" Herbert faced his friend, who carried his ice skates over his shoulder. \"Yes!\" Herbert agreed. \"We'd best!\" ... The river was somewhat crowded with skaters already; it was a popular winter destination. Herbert, with skates laced on, took one step out onto the ice and lost his footing immediately, slipping and crashing onto the crystalline surface. Archibald had no such issues, and skated around to hover over Herbert. \"I would've thought you'd done this before.\" \"I've never SUCCESSFULLY done this before,\" Herbert said cheerily from where he lay. \"But that doesn't mean I should stop trying, now, should it?\" With a sigh, Archibald extended a hand. \"Here.\" Herbert took it, and Archibald hoisted the smaller boy to his feet. As soon as Archibald let go of him, however, Herbert took three confident strides forward before hitting the ice again. After Archibald set him upright the second time, he sighed, \"Must I do everything for you? Don't let go this time.\" \"What are you – \" \"Teaching you how to move on ice without falling down, Trubshaw.\" It started with Herbert trying to skate while holding onto Archibald's hand to steady himself. Even that didn't turn out to be enough, and Archibald ended up holding onto both Herbert's forearms from behind in order to stop him from falling, instructing him how to place his feet and shift his weight in order to stay upright. It was much less of a frustrating process than Archibald had suspected it would be. All the while, the other skaters stopped to gawk at the proximity of the two boys, and Archibald just knew certain rumors were resurfacing. \"You realize they're talking about us,\" he whispered. \"Let them talk,\" Herbert responded. At last, Herbert mastered the art of moving across ice, if a little less graceful than would have been optimal, and Archibald let go of him – which he realized made him slightly disappointed. \"Look!\" Herbert crowed. \"I'm doing it!\" \"That you are,\" Archibald confirmed, skating up next to him and making a pirouette on the ice. \"Though I can still skate circles about you.\" All in all, it wasn't a bad Christmas.[Chapter 4] 4. A Conversation by the River Now that the dark held no fear, Archibald Snatcher and Herbert Trubshaw made a habit of convening after hours, when all other humans were asleep. Archibald didn't tell his parents of the late-night meetings, making sure to creep in and out quietly and blaming the one incident of a broken window on drunken delinquents. Gabriel and Amelia noticed him developing a greater tendency to nap in the middle of the day, but still suspected nothing. Herbert had attempted, for a while, to bring all of his friends together. But while Fish was open to the idea, Shoe and Archibald were both visibly uncomfortable with having to be in proximity of each other, and out of respect, Herbert decided to split his time between them all again. One night ago, he had spent some time working on bigger schematics with Fish and Shoe, but tonight was his night with Archibald. The two boys made their way down to the lower reaches of town, across a bridge, all the way to a secluded spot on the riverbank that it didn't look like anyone had ever touched. \"Perfect,\" Herbert muttered as the waters came into view; he clutched a small wooden boat that was almost magnetically drawn to the surface. The pair settled down on the bank, then Herbert beckoned, \"Watch!\" He wound a circular paddle on his boat, twisting up stretchy bands and setting mechanisms into motion, before letting the craft loose upon the river, watching it speed of its own accord across the water, its paddle propelling it furiously. \"It works!\" Herbert cried. \"IT WORKS!\" The boat promptly ran out of momentum and stalled in the middle of the river. \"And how did you plan on getting it back?\" Archibald teased. Herbert, crestfallen, realized he absolutely had not planned for that. \"Oh well,\" he sighed. \"I can always build another one.\" He took up the other item he had carried down to the riverside: a jar of grape jelly. Nowadays, he said it was his favorite food, and he always had enjoyed it quite a bit, but it had risen in his good graces once he realized it was something that was safe for Archibald to eat. Uncapping the jar, he set it down on the ground, and both boys' fingers dipped in to retrieve the sweet substance. As they both went for the food, their hands brushed, and Archibald wondered how it was that he should notice this but Herbert seemed not to be fazed at all. \"If I can refine the steam engine to work on water,\" Herbert mused, \"I could install it in the next boat and propel it farther.\" \"That still wouldn't get it to come back when you wanted it,\" Archibald pointed out. Herbert shrugged. \"Then I'll build a third.\" \"You'd clog this river with boats, wouldn't you?\" Herbert sighed. \"No, THAT'S not what I want. It would only pollute the river. Perhaps I have to keep thinking.\" Perhaps Fish and Shoe will have some ideas, he thought, though he didn't voice the sentiment out loud. \"Well, you know where to find me when you've got the next one worked up,\" Archibald reminded his friend. \"Of course!\" Herbert replied. They sat in silence for a while longer, cleaning out the jelly jar. \"Are you quite all right?\" Herbert asked. \"Usually, you've got a bit more to say.\" \"Does it truly not bother you, what they say about us?\" Archibald asked. A subject had been weighing heavily on his mind for a while, and he figured it was about time he lightened the load; he knew by now he could trust Herbert. \"That we're…involved. That we're queer.\" \"Not one bit,\" Herbert stated confidently. \"Does it bother you?\" \"Not most days. Of course, if the Portley-Rinds buy in, it will be that much harder to attain a White Hat.\" \"But not impossible.\" \"No, not impossible,\" Archibald repeated. \"Or…it wouldn't be, if the rumors were completely off the mark.\" \"Archibald, are you saying what I think you're saying?\" Herbert looked to his friend in concern. \"I am,\" Archibald admitted, not making eye contact but instead fixing his gaze on the surface of the water. \"We may not be together, but what they think about me is…well, it's quite true. I am…one of that sort.\" And as soon as he'd confessed, he realized that the weight had only gotten heavier. It really wasn't something he should have admitted to anyone, he thought, and now Herbert was likely going to be repulsed and tell his secret to everyone he could find come morning… \"That's all right,\" Herbert said softly. Not the response Archibald had been expecting, but the one he had been hoping for. \"After all, it's rather arbitrary, isn't it?\" Herbert went on. \"That men should only love women, and vice versa. Who's to say two men can't love each other, or two women? Is it because they can't bear children that way? Because that's ridiculous. I've often wished there was a way for someone to bear a child without having to involve another parent. I do so want children when I grow older, but I sometimes fear I'll never be married…I'm sorry. I've just made it about me. I didn't mean to. What I do mean to say is that it doesn't matter to me one bit whether you love women or other men. You're my friend, Archibald. That's not going to change because of this. And I know no one else would take this well. I swear to secrecy upon my very life. I won't tell a soul. Not human nor Boxtroll nor alley cat.\" And now the weight was removed, and replaced with a different presence entirely. Archibald looked at his friend to be met with an honest smile. \"Thank you, Herbert,\" Archibald replied. \"You've…no idea what it means.\" Herbert casually reached over to pat his friend on the shoulder. \"Any secret you have will be safe with me.\" \"Is that so?\" Archibald blurted. \"Because I've another, you know. A lot of times, when we get an order at the shop for a particularly beautiful dress that turns out to fit me, I try it on. Father caught me at it once and made me swear he'd never see me wearing such things again, and I kept my promise. He's never SEEN me in another gown. I'm just more careful now, and…\" He stopped himself short. Perhaps that was too far to test the boundaries of Herbert's secret-keeping. \"I…er…\" \"Do you even wear the high shoes?\" Herbert asked. \"Yes,\" Archibald replied. \"I've often wondered how women keep their balance in those high shoes,\" Herbert admitted. \"I knew you had a good sense of balance, but you must be very graceful to be able to walk in those shoes.\" \"I'd like to think I am,\" Archibald stated rather boastfully. So he really could trust Herbert with anything, it seemed. \"If I put a pair on, I doubt I'd get far,\" Herbert sighed. \"Well, we could test that out,\" Archibald suggested. \"Later tonight, even. They're not as beastly as you think.\" \"Then I am up to the challenge!\" Herbert announced. After giving it some more thought, he supplied, \"I should think you'd want a white gown to go with your eventual White Hat.\" \"It would only be fitting,\" Archibald agreed. \"Though if I were to dress as a woman while in the position of White Hat, I might just have to disguise myself fully and pretend to be someone else in order to not be found out. Though…that would be fun indeed.\" He grinned at the thought. \"I fancy myself a decent actor. I bet I could convince the entire town I was someone else.\" \"If anyone could, it would be you,\" Herbert agreed. \"Though I'd need a new name for the second identity,\" Archibald mused. \"Something with flair. Something frilly. Something…what's the word…\" \"Frou-frou?\" Herbert suggested. Click. \"That's it, Trubshaw,\" Archibald realized. \"That's not just the word; it's the NAME. Madame Frou Frou. And no one would ever know!\" \"I like the sound of it!\" Herbert agreed. Archibald realized there was a question on his mind. Whether it was new or one that had percolated for a while, he couldn't quite say. \"Trubshaw…\" \"Yes?\" \"Are you…?\" \"Am I what?\" \"Are you like me?\" \"Well, I can't say I think I would look any good in a gown, but you – \" \"Not that,\" Archibald corrected. \"What we spoke of earlier. Boys who…fancy other boys.\" \"Oh, that.\" Herbert shook his head. \"I'm not. The night we met, I had a rather unfortunate infatuation with Cynthia Grey, and I had tried to speak to her, only for her to refuse to even greet me and instead tell her acquaintances some rather mean things about my manner of dress and my parents. I can hardly think of a more unfortunate person to fancy.\" \"Try Charles Portley-Rind,\" Archibald replied. \"The same night.\" \"Oh…\" Herbert realized the full implications of what had gone on that night. \"He was indefinitely worse. I'm very sorry.\" \"You've nothing to apologize for.\" \"You deserve a man far better than him,\" Herbert stated. \"A dreamer, like you. As for Charles and Cynthia, they very well deserve each other.\" \"Earlier tonight, you said you didn't believe you'd be married,\" Archibald recalled. \"Why not?\" \"Haven't you noticed after all this time we've spent together?\" Herbert pointed out. \"I'm odd.\" \"Yes, you are. And that's your charm, Trubshaw.\" \"You flatter me!\" \"Now, are we going to put you in a pair of high shoes, or not?\" Herbert and Archibald left the riverbank, taking the jelly jar with them – Herbert was sure it would come in handy as part of some device or another. They started out across the bridge back into town. Archibald caught Herbert looking over the side of the bridge. \"What are you looking at?\" \"I can see the boat,\" Herbert answered. The bridge was old, and had not been given maintenance in a long while. It was practically a Portley-Rind tradition to ignore complaints of bits of town breaking down, especially when it came to crumbling bridges. The stones directly underneath Herbert's feet and part of the railing immediately gave way, plunging Herbert down into the waters below with a scream. \"TRUBSHAW!\" Archibald was thrown into a panic, his heart racing. Without a second thought, he dove over the side of the bridge after Herbert, plunging into the river water. Herbert was miraculously easy to locate; Archibald's hand brushed against his arm almost immediately. Archibald gathered Herbert's body into his arms, making a direct course upward, desperately hoping it wasn't too late as he broke the water's skin and entered the sphere of air. It took him a moment to realize Herbert was laughing. \"What's FUNNY?\" Archibald snapped. \"You very nearly drowned!\" \"No, I didn't!\" Herbert argued. \"I was just about to swim my way to the surface!\" \"Why are you LAUGHING?\" \"Because I fell right off the bridge and into the water! It's self-writing comedy!\" Archibald let go of Herbert, pushing him away. The duo tread water for a moment, Archibald glaring sullenly at the still-smiling Herbert, before Archibald turned to swim in the opposite direction. \"Where are you going?\" Herbert called after him. \"Might as well get your blasted boat now that we're down here!\" Archibald called back. Herbert made for the opposite bank, and Archibald arrived there some time afterward, bringing the small boat with him. He roughly shoved the contraption at Herbert. \"I thought you were going to die, you know.\" \"And I'm very grateful you came to save me.\" \"I can't take my eyes off you for a moment, can I?\" \"Give me more credit than THAT, Archibald!\" On the way back to Snatcher's Stitches, Archibald lightened up about the whole incident, mostly just glad that Herbert was safe and sound. He silently stole in and out of the shop, carrying with him a pair of high-heeled shoes. \"Just be careful with them,\" he whispered as he and Herbert moved to the adjacent alley. Herbert eagerly stepped into the shoes, standing somewhat shakily. \"You're right,\" he observed. \"They're really not bad – \" He stumbled and flailed to keep his balance. \"I'll get the hang of it,\" he told Archibald, who was watching with a rather wide grin. Herbert decided to prove himself by walking the length of the alley and coming back. And he very nearly made it; it was only a couple steps away from returning to his point of origin that he lost balance completely and went tumbling. Archibald was there to catch him in a quick stride, his arms hooking underneath Herbert's and stopping him before he could hit the stone hard. \"I seem to be falling every which way tonight,\" Herbert laughed. \"Quite lucky I've got you to catch me.\" \"Yes…quite,\" Archibald muttered, wondering all over again how Herbert was completely unable to hear his heartbeat, as it was thundering in his own ears. \"The fact remains that I can not only skate circles about you, but walk circles about you in these shoes as well.\" \"Care to prove it?\" Herbert asked mischievously. Archibald hadn't expected that. \"I think I will. Just give me the shoes first.\" They performed a swap of shoes, and Archibald kept his gaze and a sly grin fixed upon Herbert as he walked, skipped, even turned a twirl in the high-heeled footwear. \"I should have known!\" Herbert cried. \"After all, you're so graceful on the ice.\" As of that moment, Archibald could take little more. \"The hour's grown quite late. We should part ways.\" \"Well, all right,\" Herbert replied, gathering up his boat. \"I'll see you soon!\" \"I'll be seeing you soon as well.\" ... After replacing the shoes, Archibald rushed to his room, closing the door quietly and quickly. His heartbeat seemed all the more thunderous now that he was no longer in the company of a fellow human being. Images and sensations rushed through his mind: hands brushing on the way to the same jelly jar, that kind and accepting smile, clutching tight to the body of the one he'd thought might drown, breaking his fall, hearing his praise, hearing his laughter. And he knew there was one final secret he couldn't tell Herbert Trubshaw, not ever. A squeak emitted from the cage across the room, as though Framley could sense his master's disquiet. \"Framley,\" Archibald hissed, \"something's happened, and I'm not quite sure how to handle it. Might as well tell you; I can't tell anyone else.\" He moved even closer to the cage, whispering in the softest of voices, \"I think I've fallen in love with Herbert Trubshaw.\"[Chapter 5] 5. Miss Travis It was a great testament to Herbert Trubshaw's friendship with Archibald Snatcher that the former was not only able to get the latter to agree to participate in flying a kite, but in making one as well. Archibald hadn't seen the point of it. Why watch something flap about uselessly in the sky? One might as well watch birds (which was apparently something else people did that made no sense to Archibald). But Herbert had been so excited about the concept, especially of the idea that he could build the frame and string of the kite while Archibald provided the fabric to catch the wind, and Archibald found himself committing to the kite project with nary a complaint. The boys had both reached the age of sixteen, and very little had changed between them. They chose to schedule their kite-flying adventure as a rare daytime excursion, as the night sky was not optimal for viewing a kite high in the sky. On their way down the hill to the river, they caught the unmistakable scent of smoke. \"You don't suppose someone's in trouble, do you?\" Herbert asked worriedly, quickening his pace and rounding the corner to see the source of the smell. Before Archibald could answer, the boys were greeted by the sight of a mass of black smoke pouring out of the windows and doors of a tall, thin house. Faint cries could be heard from inside. \"Someone's in there!\" Herbert realized out loud. \"Trubshaw, NO,\" Archibald pleaded. \"Someone's got to help them!\" Herbert dropped the kite, rushing toward the door of the house so as to slam into it with his full weight, leading with his shoulder. \"Trubshaw, don't you DARE,\" Archibald snapped. \"Not unless you WANT to get killed.\" Herbert hit the door and bounced off. Only slightly shaken, he tried once more to break down the door in the name of rescue. \"If you go in there, I am NOT coming after you!\" Archibald added. \"It'll be your own fault!\" \"Hang on, whoever's in there!\" Herbert called at the door. \"I'm coming to get you out!\" He slammed at the door again and bounced right off. Archibald realized he was fighting a losing battle with both Herbert and himself. The next time Herbert charged the door, he ran right alongside him, and the combined momentum of the pair was just enough to break the door out of its frame. The two boys rushed into the house, following the smoke's trail down into a basement; the cries grew louder. And just as they arrived, they saw a girl about their age, dressed in blue and with dark hair pulled back into messy ponytails, pouring a bucket of water onto a smoking mechanical contraption that itself resembled a bucket set atop a mess of cogs and levers. \"No, no, NO!\" she moaned. \"No, it's all gone wrong! You weren't supposed to catch fire! You were only supposed to – \" She then became aware of the fact that she wasn't alone. Sheepishly, she turned to look at her would-be rescuers. \"Oh, hello,\" she said with a guilty smile and wave. \"We've come to save you from the…fire,\" Herbert explained. The girl replied with a nervous laugh. \"No fire here. Well, there was, but I've put it out. Everything's all right now. Sorry to make you worry.\" \"That might have been a good thing to know before we BROKE YOUR DOOR IN,\" Archibald growled. \"Oops…\" the girl squeaked. \"Don't worry!\" She put up and waved her hands. \"I'll tell my parents it was all my fault! Oh, they won't be happy about any of this at all…and I was so CERTAIN I'd gotten my machine to work properly.\" At a certain word, Herbert's attention switched tracks: \"Machine? Were you building something?\" \"It's washing day,\" the girl explained, \"so I thought perhaps things would go faster if I made a machine to do it for me. See? The washing tub vibrates, and the clothes get tumbled around the board set inside of it…or at least, that's how it was supposed to go. What it actually ended up doing was just creating a lot of smoke. And now I'm to be even farther behind on the washing.\" \"Not to mention what we've done to your door,\" Herbert said mournfully. An idea then occurred to him. \"Might I help you finish up your work?\" \"You've no need to do that,\" the girl told him. \"It's my mess. I'll clean it all up.\" \"Far be it from me to abandon someone in need, even if it is only washing clothes,\" Herbert told her. He then turned to Archibald; \"You don't have to stay, of course. You can go out with the kite. Or do whatever you'd rather do, if the kite isn't to your liking.\" \"Of course the kite's to my liking!\" Archibald blurted almost automatically. \"After I put all that blue on it, it had better be.\" He truly did not want to spend time in a stranger's basement helping her wash clothes, but even less did he want to go back outside and try to enjoy his time alone. He was still terribly smitten with Herbert, and to that end, he was willing to commit to such tedium in order to keep their arranged date. \"Though I think I'll chip in with the washing as well. You'll probably do it wrong anyway.\" He gave Herbert a playful shove, which Herbert returned. \"Well, both of you have my UTMOST gratitude,\" the girl sighed, removing the washing tub from its vibrating base and bringing out several garments to toss into the water. As she set up the tub for cleaning, Herbert asked, \"Might we know your name?\" \"It's Marjorie,\" the girl replied. \"Marjorie Travis. And yours?\" \"Herbert Trubshaw,\" Herbert answered, extending a hand. Marjorie took it, and Herbert shook it firmly. He shakes a lady's hand instead of kissing it, and it's passed off so casually, Archibald thought, but when I kiss a man's hand, I find myself abjectly ostracized. \"And you?\" Marjorie approached Archibald. Archibald didn't know exactly what it was about Marjorie he didn't like, but she was in some way annoying him greatly. She had been ever since she'd shown off her makeshift \"washing machine.\" Still, in the name of decorum, he took Marjorie's hand and very briefly kissed it in greeting. \"Archibald Snatcher. Pleasure to meet you.\" Even though he didn't really mean it. \"And a pleasure to meet you!\" Marjorie replied. Soon, the trio was settled around the washing tub, all working away at various garments with their own washing boards. Herbert couldn't help himself from looking around the basement, which resembled a small workshop. \"You're an inventor, aren't you?\" he said in awe. \"Sometimes,\" Marjorie told him. \"Sometimes, I'm just a builder. I built the pencil sharpener on that desk there. It works better than the ones my parents gave me.\" \"And what's that?\" Herbert indicated a large hunk of metal stuck to the ceiling; several smaller metal tools were attached to it. \"Oh, that…\" Marjorie muttered. \"That was supposed to be a storage magnet for my tools. I thought, why not stick them all to the ceiling with a magnet and take them down whenever I needed them? Then I wouldn't have to clutter up the desk! But the magnet turned out to be too strong, and now I can't unstick anything from it. I probably should have just used hooks to hang them from the ceiling instead.\" \"Probably,\" Archibald confirmed. \"And then there's the…\" Marjorie then interrupted herself; \"I'm talking too much about my contraptions, aren't I? I keep forgetting it's not proper conversation.\" \"Oh, I think it's very good conversation,\" Herbert told her. \"I think all of these things are brilliant!\" \"You do?\" Marjorie blushed. \"I'm a builder and inventor myself,\" Herbert went on. \"I've actually been trying to put together a vehicle that will travel the streets powered by an engine for the past few years.\" \"Really? That sounds fascinating! I'd LOVE to see it!\" \"I'd be quite happy to show you!\" Archibald watched as Herbert and Marjorie seemed to glow more brightly in each other's presence, communing over their shared interest in mechanics. \"I find it strange that I haven't seen you about.\" \"I don't really go out, actually. I spend most of my time in here, working on my projects.\" \"To tell you the truth, I mostly go out at night, anyway.\" One of them a young boy, and one of them a girl the same age. \"You mustn't be afraid of Boxtrolls, then.\" \"Absolutely not!\" \"I've always wondered if they really were as much of monsters as people said. I've never SEEN them eat a human being, after all. I don't think anyone has. It's mostly talk.\" They hadn't taken their eyes off each other since they'd begun conversing, and Archibald was beginning to realize exactly what it was he disliked about Marjorie Travis. It had to do with the way she was making Herbert smile. \"And what about you, Archibald?\" Marjorie asked, suddenly realizing she was excluding one of the group. \"Do you build things, too?\" \"No,\" Archibald replied. \"I don't. I've other concerns.\" \"Such as?\" \"Helping to put my family's business on the map. A Snatcher is going to be the next to wear the White Hat, you know, whether it's my father or me.\" \"Archibald is actually a songwriter,\" Herbert broke in. \"He's also quite deft with a sewing needle.\" \"Snatcher!\" Marjorie realized. \"That's where I've heard that name! You're the tailor's son! Your family does VERY good work, you know.\" \"And I'm responsible for quite a bit of that work,\" Archibald clarified. \"If they picked out White Hats based on their ability to make good clothing,\" Marjorie told him, \"you'd certainly be in within the year! I think you even made some of these things we're washing!\" Archibald was about to thank Marjorie, but something in her tone and her words held him back. \"What was that supposed to mean? White Hats are chosen based on the work they contribute to the town, and clothing is a staple of society.\" \"Oh, dear…\" Marjorie said softly. \"I'm afraid it's never been that way. My parents tried to tell me it was like that, too, but I've looked into the history of the White Hats, and as far back as they've been established, they've only been the wealthy and the sons of the wealthy. Oh, and never the daughters. Perhaps it's the greatest tragedy of our town. It's all just a great illusion to make us think they know what's best for this town, when really, they don't give a whit about the crumbling bridges or the fact that no one's yet built a hospital that will take children.\" \"You know NOTHING about the White Hats,\" Archibald snarled. \"How could you? You're ONLY a girl.\" \"I'm a SMART girl,\" Marjorie snapped before immediately realizing her mistake, clapping both hands over her mouth. \"I didn't mean to say you WEREN'T smart,\" she said through the skin of her hands. \"I think we should all take a step back – \" Herbert began. Archibald dropped the cloth he'd been washing right back into the tub. \"I'll be back at the shop, finishing up some work I really should have been doing all day,\" he said, looking directly at Herbert. \"I'll take the kite back home. Come by when you want to pick it up.\" With that, he stormed out of the room and up the stairs. There was a long silence before Marjorie lowered her hands from her mouth. \"I'm sorry,\" she whimpered. \"Though I suppose I'm saying it to the wrong person.\" \"I think you're quite smart,\" Herbert told Marjorie. \"For a girl?\" \"For anyone. What you said about the White Hats is something I've suspected for a very long time. But becoming one of them has always been Archibald's dream, and I don't want to stand in the way of it. I've tried to convince him he doesn't need a White Hat to be happy. He's very smart and creative, quite like you…just in a different way. And the truth is, if he were a White Hat, he'd do more for this town than any of the lords ever have. I know it's a slim chance, but I think part of me believes he'll make his dream come true. And a bigger part of me truly WANTS him to.\" \"I really shouldn't have said a thing,\" Marjorie moaned. \"Oh, don't be sad!\" Herbert said quickly. \"You were right. You just said the right thing at the wrong time, is all.\" \"You're a good friend, Herbert,\" Marjorie said. \"To him, and, well, I don't know if I can call you my friend just yet, but you're very kind to help me with the washing. Though…\" She cracked a smile. \"I think my parents are going to have a hard time believing you broke down the door all by yourself.\" \"We'll just tell them I'm stronger than I look!\" Herbert and Marjorie laughed, catching each other's eye and then immediately looking away. \"As to what you said about Boxtrolls, though…\" Herbert began. ... The next day, Amelia knocked on her son's bedroom door, waiting for a \"Come in\" before entering. \"Young Master Trubshaw is here,\" she announced, \"and he wants to know if you still have a kite.\" Archibald cast aside the book he'd been reading, immediately fetching the kite from its resting place. A day out with Herbert would certainly make up for the misadventure of the day before – \"And he's brought a friend with him. Miss…Travis, I believe she said her name was.\" Or not. \"Friends already, I suppose,\" Archibald muttered as his mother took her leave. \"I already know where this is going. He wants all his friends to be able to be together, just like with those trolls. Well, perhaps she isn't so bad after all. We might've just gotten off on the wrong foot.\" He carried the kite gently downstairs to find Marjorie trying on an ornate royal blue hat while Amelia and Herbert looked on. \"This is BEAUTIFUL!\" Marjorie gushed. \"Absolutely beautiful, Mrs. Snatcher!\" \"Why, thank you,\" Amelia replied, quite charmed. \"And it looks beautiful on you!\" Herbert complimented. It was a wonder Archibald didn't snap the kite frame in half over his knee then and there. He'd tried on that hat the previous night in order to take his mind off the first Marjorie Travis incident, and he'd thought it made him look simply gorgeous. He'd wondered, if Herbert saw him in it, if Herbert would think the same. And now Marjorie was showing it off in public – she could do that, of course, being a girl – and Herbert loved it. Forcing a smile, Archibald walked the rest of the way down the stairs and made his presence known. \"Miss Travis!\" he greeted. \"What a surprise!\" \"Archibald!\" Marjorie gasped. \"I just wanted to say I'm sorry for yesterday. I didn't mean…\" She quickly put the hat back in its resting place. \"I didn't realize how much all that meant to you, and I shouldn't have said a thing.\" \"Water under the bridge, Miss Travis,\" Archibald told her. \"Though I must ask what exactly you're doing here.\" \"That would be my fault,\" Herbert answered. \"I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to do something other than chores together. First and most importantly of all, to mend fences. And second, well, I'm quite fond of both of you, and so I thought – \" Archibald put up a hand. \"Say no more. This day belongs to the…three of us.\" ... On the way down to the riverbank, Archibald mostly kept quiet, observing the interactions of Herbert and Marjorie. It had only been a day, after all. They couldn't be that close. Only barely friends. It wasn't as though he had anything to really worry about…not even the fact that a girl so infectiously bubbly as Herbert (though she didn't pull it off nearly as well) and sharing his biggest interest was getting so close to the boy Archibald loved. It wasn't as though such a thing should matter, as Herbert had already stated that he wasn't the sort that could reciprocate those feelings to Archibald anyway. \"Are you all right?\" Marjorie asked, falling into step alongside Archibald. \"You've been awful quiet.\" \"Perfectly fine, Miss Travis,\" Archibald said smoothly. \"You can call me 'Marjorie,' you know,\" Marjorie encouraged. \"Duly noted.\" \"I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for him to use your given name,\" Herbert laughed. The blue kite was raised to fly in the wind, which was quite breezy that day. Herbert held the string in place. \"I do love that color,\" Marjorie said happily. It was Archibald's other favorite color besides red; the one he felt he looked the absolute best in. He knew Herbert would tell Marjorie it was his idea if he didn't say anything, so he spoke up briefly: \"Why, thank you, Miss Travis.\" \"Herbert said you two worked on this together,\" Marjorie brought up. \"Did Fish and Shoe help you as well?\" That caught Archibald off guard. \"As in…\" \"The Boxtrolls,\" Marjorie said softly. \"Herbert said you knew about them.\" \"I do know about them,\" Archibald replied, his voice gaining a slight edge. \"I wasn't aware YOU would know about them after only a day.\" \"I'm introducing them all tonight,\" Herbert explained. \"Marjorie understood right away when I said they weren't monsters. I knew she would believe me.\" \"As though I wouldn't have believed you for the first year we knew each other, Trubshaw?\" \"We were younger,\" Herbert said softly. \"I wasn't sure how to proceed.\" So now Marjorie knew Herbert's biggest secret, and after but a day. Archibald realized Herbert and Marjorie were both staring at him in wary anticipation. \"I'm not about to storm off,\" he sighed. \"It just came as a surprise, that's all. Best forget about it. I do hope you enjoy meeting Trubshaw's troll friends, Miss Travis.\" He hoped this would be the night Fish actually did decide he had a taste for human blood and would devour Marjorie right in front of Herbert's eyes. But as the three spent more time together beneath the kite, soon they fell into conversation, and the afternoon became almost pleasant. ... After that, Herbert, Archibald, and Marjorie became somewhat of a trio for a short time. Archibald tried his very best to stomach Marjorie and her proximity to Herbert. After all, he didn't have any confirmation that there was anything between them, and Herbert would be the sort to become friends with a woman without the thought of romance between them. Still, she only made Archibald more and more annoyed, and he did his absolute best to join her and Herbert on all of their excursions – testing out the vehicle and watching it break down for what seemed like the millionth time, walking lazily along the banks of the river, sledding once the first snow came – simply so that she and Herbert would not have much time to themselves, where Archibald couldn't keep an eye on them. But Herbert grew perceptive, and while he wasn't sure exactly why Archibald was so uncomfortable with Marjorie, he figured out quickly that he was, and suggested that he spend time with each of them separately. \"It's a shame that Master Trubshaw doesn't bring Miss Travis around the house anymore these days,\" Amelia remarked. \"You know, Archibald…I had rather thought you and she might make a cute couple.\" That had only caused Archibald to literally flip a chair over end on his way storming out of the room. Amelia wasn't sure what she'd said wrong; didn't her son see the appeal in a nice girl like that? But she refrained from discussing Marjorie in such a manner in the future. Christmas came, and Herbert and Archibald had set aside that day for themselves, swapping gifts before heading down to the river with their skates, as they had done for the past three years. There was a difference this year, however. Herbert seemed to only want to talk about one thing. \"And then she told me the funniest joke,\" Herbert bubbled as he laced his skates. \"Do you want to hear it?\" \"Not particularly,\" Archibald grunted. Herbert only then seemed to realize he'd been going on about Marjorie for the past hour with very little of a break. \"I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.\" \"Forgetting what?\" \"That you and Marjorie don't quite get on.\" He paused. \"Why don't you get on, anyhow?\" \"What do you mean? We get on quite well.\" \"Don't lie to me, Archibald,\" Herbert sighed. \"I could tell you weren't comfortable with her. That's why I thought it would be better if I spent different days with each of you. Did she do something to offend you?\" \"Nothing of the sort, Trubshaw.\" \"Then what is it? You know you can tell me anything.\" Instead of giving Herbert an answer, Archibald returned a question: \"Do you fancy Miss Travis?\" \"What?\" Herbert went immediately red. \"Don't YOU lie to ME, Trubshaw. You always get daft and giggly around her, and there's this sparkle in your eyes whenever you talk about her.\" \"Well, I…\" Herbert lowered his voice. \"I actually do fancy her ever so slightly. I haven't wanted to bring it up because…well, I haven't wanted to rush it. She is, first and foremost, my friend, and I don't want to put that bond in danger.\" Realization kicked in. \"Is that what it is? Are you afraid our friendship will fall apart if someone like that comes into my life?\" \"The word isn't 'afraid,'\" Archibald sighed, \"but otherwise, that's a fairly accurate description of the situation.\" \"Archibald,\" Herbert said sternly, \"you've been my oldest and dearest friend, and I can't imagine what it would take to change that. Even if Marjorie and I become married, I will never forget or neglect you. I don't want to lose you, and I certainly don't want to hurt you. And if I come close to doing either, promise me you'll tell me.\" \"I will.\" \"I'm sorry if I've been doing that already, Archibald. It's just…when you fancy someone, you lose sight of a lot of other important things, sometimes.\" Archibald very nearly said \"I know\" before realizing he couldn't pin such deep sympathy on his brief experience falling for Charles Portley-Rind. He tied the last of his skate laces, standing up on the ice and extending a hand downward to Herbert. \"Let's just skate, shall we?\" \"Of course!\" Herbert let Archibald pull him to his feet before gliding along on his own. \"I think I've finally mastered the art!\" They were on their own for a few precious moments. Then a speeding force came gliding across the ice to collide with Herbert, knocking him to the ground. \"SORRY!\" the interloper cried. \"I'm sorry, I'm – Herbert?\" No. It couldn't be, Archibald thought. It wasn't. But of course, it was. \"Marjorie!\" Herbert replied as he disentangled himself from the girl. \"I didn't realize you'd be here!\" \"I didn't realize YOU'D be here!\" \"Archibald and I come here every year,\" Herbert explained, getting to his feet. \"Have you been coming here all these years?\" \"This is my first year,\" Marjorie explained, propping herself up on her knees. \"The first time I've ever tried skating, actually. I thought it couldn't be that hard. It's all about the principles of balance and center of gravity.\" She tried to stand, but wobbled. Herbert immediately extended a hand to her, and she gratefully took it, letting him help her up. Almost instantly, Herbert regretted making the physical contact, thinking perhaps he'd overstepped his boundaries again. \"It's good to see you, Marjorie, but we'll have to catch up some other time. This is Archibald's and my special time together. It's our tradition.\" \"I understand,\" Marjorie said sincerely. \"You two go have fun. I've got my hands full trying to figure out these skates.\" Archibald wasted no time in gliding away from Marjorie, and Herbert followed. \"This day is about you and me,\" Herbert promised. \"And nothing will change that.\" A sudden high-pitched yelp alerted the boys to the fact that Marjorie had fallen over yet again. Herbert and Archibald turned to see her sprawled out on the ice. \"…Go to her,\" Archibald sighed. \"No!\" Herbert protested. \"When I said this was our day, I meant it!\" \"Look at her,\" Archibald argued. \"She needs someone to show her the ropes. And you're quite right. You have mastered the art of skating beyond what I can teach. But most of all…you fancy her. Go be with her.\" \"Are you…entirely certain?\" Herbert asked cautiously. \"Very certain.\" In truth, Archibald just knew that he, Herbert, and Marjorie couldn't share the same lake without Herbert wanting to watch Marjorie and wishing he could help her with her balance problems the entire time. No matter what Herbert promised, Archibald was convinced that Marjorie would still get in the way. He'd had his suspicions confirmed; Herbert was smitten. \"I promise I'll make it up to you,\" Herbert told Archibald as he skated toward Marjorie. Archibald simply smiled and waved…until Herbert turned away. Archibald's smile quickly inverted, and he scowled as he watched Herbert help Marjorie up, watched him take her hands and skate backward as she skated forward, keeping her from falling. As though Archibald hadn't given Herbert all the skating skill he had. As though he hadn't done so in much closer proximity. He glided to the edge of the river, replaced his shoes, and went home. Entering his room, he sighed, \"Framley, absolutely everything is going wrong.\" There was absolutely no sound from the cage at the other end of the room: not a click, not a squeak. Archibald's heart skipped a beat as he rushed to the cage to see the worst: Framley's dead body lay still in the cage's center. He supposed he shouldn't have been surprised. Three years was a surprisingly long life for a rat. Archibald's scowl returned in greater force. \"Never mind,\" he muttered. \"Never mind it, never mind Trubshaw, never mind Miss Travis, and never mind YOU. It wasn't as though you were ever going to amount to anything. You were always just a lowly, stupid RAT.\"[Chapter 6] 6. Guest of Dishonor After that, the years seemed to pass all too quickly. Herbert divided his time, as usual, between Archibald and Marjorie, though the latter was getting more and more of his attention, and it seemed that Herbert and Marjorie were indeed truly falling in love as Archibald watched from the sidelines. They did complement each other well. Rarely did an unkind word pass between them. So be it, then. Archibald could live without Herbert. He had other things to think about. Once he'd reached adulthood, he was thrust into the responsibility of having to earn his own living. So far, he'd been doing exactly that at Snatcher's Stitches, taking up the needle of the family business. And well he had, for Amelia and Gabriel were showing their age; Archibald noticed on most days, when his mother held a sewing needle, her fingers trembled, and it was only with great difficulty that she could get the stitch exactly where she wanted it to go. Lucky she was, Archibald thought, that her son was more dexterous and a bit more creative. Herbert, on the other side of the coin, had attempted to perfect a few of his inventions to sell, but ended up working as a repairman instead, using his gift of mechanical skill to stop pipes from leaking and lamps from malfunctioning. Marjorie had volunteered for the same line of work, but was turned down for her gender. There were some things in Cheesebridge one could only get by being a man. But quite others one could get by being a woman, as Archibald was to find out. He had been keeping a secret project in his bedroom. For a while, he had told himself it was only to practice his skill as a tailor, but once he'd reached a certain age, he realized he couldn't play such childish games of denial with himself. He was sewing himself a dress to his exact measurements, and while he knew far better than to tell everyone else, he stopped caring about his own stigma toward the project. It was quite a lovely dress, anyhow, royal blue. And all the while, Archibald still believed that someone in his family was destined for the all-important White Hat. As Gabriel was getting on in years, it only made sense now that the one to be awarded the honor was Archibald himself. All it would take was one great turnaround event to make the current White Hats see that the Snatchers were perhaps the most pivotal family to all of Cheesebridge. Any day now, opportunity would come knocking on the door. And one day, as Archibald was thinking this as he hemmed a pair of pants for the latest order, there actually did sound a knock on the door, and he thought it must be serendipity. It turned out to be Herbert. \"Hello,\" Herbert greeted. Somehow, fourteen whole years had passed, and he and Archibald were both thirty years old. Herbert's smile was still the same as that he'd borne as a thirteen-year-old: youthful, sincere, welcoming. \"Hello,\" Archibald replied. Seeing Herbert still made his heart beat a little faster, but at the same time, it made his stomach turn ever so slightly. Elation. Disgust. \"What brings you here, Trubshaw?\" \"Well, I've…I've come with very great news,\" Herbert announced. \"At least, I think it's great news. The greatest news I've ever heard in my life.\" Archibald grew suspicious. \"You…can't possibly have earned a White Hat.\" Herbert shook his head. \"It's something much better. Marjorie and I are to be married!\" Like a blow to the face. When, Archibald wondered, will I stop caring? It was truly pathetic how much he could be jostled by Herbert's words, in his mind. Perhaps it was time to force himself to stop. \"…Congratulations,\" he managed, and Herbert could tell he didn't really mean it. \"Archibald, I…I know you and Marjorie haven't ever gotten on well,\" Herbert sighed. \"But all the same, you're still quite important to me. The second most important person in my life, after her. And I was quite hoping you would be my best man. If you don't, that's quite all right, but – \" \"All right, all right, Trubshaw, you don't have to twist my arm.\" Archibald gave him a smile. \"I'll do it.\" \"Oh, thank you, THANK you!\" Herbert flung his arms around his friend in gratitude. This made it exponentially more difficult for Archibald to stop caring. \"You've no idea what it means to me that you'll be there!\" Not half as much as what it means to you that you're marrying her, Archibald thought. But once again, he reminded himself, he had more important things to worry about, such as hats. \"It's just going to be a small affair,\" Herbert was explaining. \"Just our families and close friends at the small church at the edge of town.\" And he said more, including the date of the wedding – October 30th, as Herbert had fancied being wed on All Hallow's Eve but his family had balked - but Archibald was tuning him out, thinking about how much this wedding was absolutely not the opportunity he'd so craved. And when Herbert left, Archibald didn't know whether or not he was glad he'd agreed to attend it. His take on the subject slowly settled into apathy. After all, what mattered far more to him as of that moment was prestige, and that was something he hadn't yet got. ... The following week, there came a knock on the door of Snatcher's Stitches, and Archibald was once again to answer it. He was surprised to find Cynthia Grey standing on the other side, and he already wasn't looking forward to whatever she had to say. \"Wonderful news!\" she gushed. \"Oh, it's just the most wonderful news! Charles Portley-Rind has asked me to marry him!\" \"Well, good for you,\" Archibald seethed through gritted teeth. \"I want you and your family to arrange for all of the gowns and suits!\" Cynthia went on. \"Only the best will do, after all!\" As it turned out, opportunity had knocked. Archibald opened the door wide, gesturing into the shop. \"Please do forgive my rudeness, Miss Grey,\" he said charmingly. \"Or shall I say the future Lady Portley-Rind?\" At that, the woman outright squealed. \"Do enter,\" Archibald bade her. Once she had stepped over the threshold, he called back, \"OH, MOTHER! FATHER! WE HAVE QUITE AN IMPORTANT GUEST!\" ... In the weeks leading up to the Portley-Rind/Grey wedding, Snatcher's Stitches bustled with activity. Cynthia's passel of bridesmaids, all of whom seemed to look almost exactly the same, took their stations about the shop's interior as Amelia and Gabriel rushed back and forth with lace, shoes, and thread. Archibald himself was assigned to hemming Cynthia's wedding gown, which was a lavish affair that had cost a pretty penny. Dinners would be upscale in the Snatcher household for weeks. \"It was simply the most romantic thing!\" Cynthia gushed. \"I was at the latest soirée hosted by the Portley-Rinds – you know, only the most important families in town are invited at all to that sort of thing – and over to me walks Charles, telling me that he's simply awestruck by how beautiful I am and that he's been in love with me since he first saw me! And to think we'd hardly ever spoken before that day, but now, I'm about to marry the richest and most powerful man in all of Cheesebridge!\" Of course, Archibald thought. All you had to do was be rich and look pretty and you'd catch the eye of those in power. He desperately wanted to take one of the pins he was using to put up the gown's hem and jab it into Cynthia's ankle, but he knew that injuring his richest customer was absolutely bad for business. Working on the wedding of the soon-to-be-newest White Hat and Lord of the town was sure to bring status to the Snatcher family. And if it didn't, what would? \"You really do an excellent job with hemming,\" Cynthia told Archibald. \"It almost makes one forget your more…disreputable qualities.\" Archibald didn't dignify that with an answer. \"Since you've done so much for the occasion,\" Cynthia went on, \"I suppose it would only be proper of me to extend an invitation to your family.\" \"An invitation?\" Archibald repeated. \"To your wedding to future Lord Portley-Rind?\" \"Yes,\" Cynthia confirmed, though the more she thought about it, the more she wondered if it was a good idea after all. \"After all, it will be good to have tailors about in case of a ripped seam on the big day.\" \"And what date would the lovely occasion be, again?\" Archibald asked. \"October 30th,\" Cynthia replied. \"Beastly date, I know. Far too close to All Hallow's Eve. But it was the only time we could book the larger chapel.\" Of course it would be the same date as Herbert and Marjorie's wedding. Archibald had to debate on it for only a short time. One of those events would allow him to rub elbows with the wealthy and powerful, to put in his bid for a White Hat. The other sorely lacked in that department. And as a bonus, one of those events didn't involve Archibald having to watch the subject of his affections give himself away to another. \"I would be most honored to attend,\" he replied. \"You can count on my attendance.\" \"Oh, wonderful!\" Cynthia said insincerely, already regretting her decision…though she didn't know what other option she would have if she encountered a ripped seam. All that was left was to tell Herbert that he was down a best man. But Archibald didn't worry about that. He could spin his words better when the time came. For the moment, he focused on the careful arrangement of pins. ... The Trubshaw wedding was indeed a small and intimate affair, without many frills to speak of. Before the ceremony, Marjorie, clad in a simple white dress, peered out from her dressing room. She couldn't help the fact that her stomach was growling madly, and she was hoping to find something to calm its hunger before she had to be focused on such more important things as becoming the wife of the love of her life. As she crept down the hall, she heard a voice behind her: \"You look absolutely stunning.\" Smiling, she turned to face Herbert, who was done up in a simple suit. \"Don't you know it's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding?\" \"I've never believed in bad luck,\" Herbert replied. \"I think you make your own luck, really.\" \"Would you walk with me to find some food, then?\" Marjorie asked. \"I'm dreadfully hungry.\" \"Then you shall feast!\" Herbert proclaimed dramatically, pointing down the hall. \"Perhaps not feast just yet,\" Marjorie laughed. \"But a little something would be appreciated.\" They walked the back hallways of the small church, and though Herbert put on all the airs of being perfectly happy, Marjorie knew he was still bothered by something rather weighty. \"For what it's worth,\" she offered him, \"I'm sorry they couldn't be here.\" \"It's all right,\" Herbert sighed. \"At least when it comes to Fish and Shoe, I understand why they're not here. Inviting them would have been a risk to their safety, what with all these people about who think Boxtrolls are cannibals. I hope one day, it won't be that way. But Archibald…he gave me his word. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. The Portley-Rind wedding might just be the gateway to that hat he's always dreamed of. Or…at least, I know he thinks that way.\" He was surprised when Marjorie leaned over and wrapped her arms about him comfortingly. \"I wish he were here too,\" she muttered. \"But you two never got on.\" \"But YOU two did.\" Herbert stopped in his tracks to return Marjorie's embrace. \"I'm with you now,\" he whispered to her, \"and that's the most important thing of all. Thank you for being here today. For being with me as long as you've been.\" Marjorie squeezed her fiancé a bit tighter. \"I should be the one thanking you. I know you don't believe in luck, but I think it was a stroke of very good luck that you came barging into my basement to save me from a fire that was already out fourteen years ago.\" \"HERbert!\" Herbert's mother came across the mostly-happy couple from the opposite direction. \"Don't you know you're not supposed to see the bride before her wedding?\" She peeled the groom-to-be off the bride-to-be and hastily shuffled him down the hall. \"I'll see you soon!\" Herbert called back to Marjorie. \"I can't wait!\" Marjorie replied before continuing her quest for a bit of food. ... The Portley-Rind wedding, on the other hand, was lavish in every sense of the word. Everyone shone in bright ruffly gowns and pristine tuxedos, all of which had to be kept under the watchful eyes of the three Snatchers to prevent stains, tears, and other forms of ruination. Already they'd had to repair three seams and put two heels back on broken shoes. But when all was said and done, Archibald thought as he sat in the very back pew of the chapel, he'd snagged a definite victory the moment the rear doors of the nave opened up to reveal the absolutely glowing Cynthia in her five layers of frills. Archibald stole a quick look up at Charles near the altar; the redhead was gobsmacked. How much of it was because of Cynthia, Archibald wondered, and how much of it was because of what she'd been wearing? Or was that giving the Snatchers too much credit? The ceremony itself was a snore. Archibald caught himself nearly falling asleep twice as scripture after scripture was read. When the priest overseeing the union declared marriage a sacred rite to only be shared between man and woman, Archibald realized, thinking about it for perhaps the first and only time in his life, that he never would be married. Not unless he had to feign interest in some woman or another in order to be viewed as a proper candidate for the White Hats, but then again, he thought, if all women were like Marjorie, he'd sooner die. It seemed to take forever for the rites to end, and then the wedding party moved on to the literal party at the Portley-Rind manor, with guests in tow. And Archibald found himself in relatively the same position he'd been in at age thirteen when he was present at Charles' birthday celebration. As Charles and Cynthia whirled about on the floor, followed by the rest of the guests, Archibald was sidelined. No one wished to speak with him or dance with him. Nor did he wish to speak or dance with anyone else. He was soberly reminded of how much he hated these social gatherings. Even his parents were out on the floor, waltzing slowly. Archibald had done his part when he'd fixed the last broken heel. His name was already known among the upper class for putting together the gorgeous confection that Cynthia was wearing. He figured there wasn't much left to do but leave. He gave his parents and no one else the grace of saying goodbye, muttering that he had \"work to catch up on\" and needed to get a head start. Then he was quickly storming away from the chapel and down the street, glaring angrily at the stones in the road. So they would only pay attention to him for as long as they needed him, and it was back to pretending he didn't exist, was it? Then a thought began to take shape in his mind, and it was quite a ridiculous thought. The sort of thought that began as a silly daydream, a what-if that had no business being. After all, he didn't really care about silly parties, did he? And the idea that had occurred to him was nothing more than a potential way to actually enjoy the festivities. Simply put, he thought that if he really wanted everyone else to pay attention to him, he could return in another guise. He expected this idea to get worse the further he went, but with every step he took, it seemed to only get better. He realized he wanted to try it, at least once. Perhaps he did care about those ridiculous parties after all. Perhaps he wanted social recognition in more dimensions than one. Perhaps he wanted to pull off the plan for its own sake, because if now wasn't the time to break it out, where would he ever be able to? He hurried home. Even though he was alone in the shop, he still locked the doors of his chambers tightly, knowing if anyone saw his transformation, he was as good as dead. He quickly but delicately changed from his formals into the royal blue gown. Archibald realized that whether or not he'd been conscious of it, he'd been putting this plan together for a long time. For he had also acquired a red wig one day, claiming it was for a customer with thinning hair. He had then teased it into a complex updo so as to prevent its crafter from ever recognizing it when it was worn. As he swept his own hair up to hide it beneath this wig, Archibald realized he had far fewer of his natural locks than he once had. When had he lost so much of it? Though it wasn't as if it mattered. The final step was to steal into his mother's washroom and raid her makeup. She had been wearing it less and less these days in her old age. She certainly wouldn't notice if such a minimal amount was missing. When Archibald checked himself over in the mirror, he was stunned; upon first glimpse, he couldn't actually believe he was looking at himself. He was convinced that somehow, a beauty of a redheaded woman had gotten between himself and the mirror. Pitching his voice up as high as he could, he said softly, \"I'm absolutely unrecognizable.\" No, the voice was still too much of a giveaway. It took him some experimentation to disguise it with a strong accent; \"Is that better? Oh, why, YES, that is MUCH better! Gentlemen, I do hope you're equipped to meet the extraordinary Madame Frou Frou.\" And within a short span of time, it was Frou Frou who returned to the Portley-Rind manor. Archibald was quite pleased to notice that the doorman had very obviously thought about asking him if he were one of the guests, but upon beholding the sight of \"her\" in full, had decided against it, simply holding the door open wide, a giddy smile on his face. Archibald turned to fire a wink at the doorman just to toy with him further. This was already going better than expected. When he entered the room, there seemed to be a shift in the atmosphere. Eyes were now turned upon him in droves. Perhaps, he thought, he'd just gotten lucky with the doorman, and his disguise was too obvious to everyone else, and he'd just made his own ruination, turning up dressed as a woman in front of every important personage in Cheesebridge – \"Pardon me,\" one of the men said, his voice dripping with lust. \"But could you spare me a dance? After all, you're QUITE a beauty.\" \"Pardon YOU!\" Another man shoved him aside. \"My lady, I would appreciate it if I were to be your first dance instead. HE isn't good enough for someone of your caliber.\" \"As if she'd want to dance with either of you!\" A third shoved them both aside. \"You haven't even asked her name! What…is your name, my lady?\" \"They call me Madame Frou Frou,\" Archibald replied coyly, extending a hand. And just like that, everything changed. Suddenly, every man in the room wanted to talk to him, wanted to dance with him, was fixated upon him. A great many of the women avoided this \"Madame Frou Frou\" deliberately, jealous that \"she\" had stolen the hearts of all of the men present, but a few did eagerly approach for conversation, wanting to be graced by the beauty and popularity of this uninvited guest whom nobody seemed to care about the origins of. But the best part of it, Archibald relished, was the way that Charles Portley-Rind – newly married, supposedly infatuated with Cynthia – kept making a point of staring at him in awe. Cynthia finally noticed and pulled his earlobe sharply to make him stop ogling Frou Frou. This only made Charles careful to direct his gaze when he was sure Cynthia wasn't paying attention. Archibald still remembered when he thought Charles was an immaculate beauty with whom he had no chance. That the shoe was on the other foot filled him with malicious glee. If only you knew, he thought. But of course, the point was that no one ever would or could know the truth about Frou Frou's identity. That absolutely would be the best way to tarnish Archibald's reputation forever. Archibald made a point of leaving the party early in order to beat his parents home. They had greeted him politely, having no idea that they were speaking to their son. Gabriel, of all the men in the room, was the only one who had actually acted like a decent human being, merely greeting Frou Frou like an acquaintance rather than a dessert he wished to devour. Snatcher men were sensible like that, it occurred to Archibald. When he did leave, it was with a great sense of happiness. He'd been twirled about the dance floor and asked his opinion on a thousand conversational topics. Within one night of existing to the public, Madame Frou Frou was already closer to obtaining a status than Archibald Snatcher had ever been. And it certainly wouldn't be her last night out, Archibald thought, hastily inventing her biography on the route homeward.[Chapter 7] 7. Those We Lost Archibald Snatcher and Herbert Trubshaw had not spoken in months. And it might have taken them even longer if it hadn't been for the cabbages. Pure chance had led them out to market on the same day, causing both of them to approach a streetside produce stand without noticing each other, each inspecting the cabbage of his choice. Deciding the vegetables they held were not up to par, they put the greens back where they had found them, only to reach for the same cabbage. Their hands collided. \"Pardon – \" Herbert began, but as he turned to see who he'd inconvenienced, his entire countenance changed entirely to something far more somber than he'd been. \"Archibald?\" First things first, when Archibald realized his hand had brushed against Herbert's, his heart had skipped a beat. Apparently old emotional ties didn't die as easily as he wanted them to. He wasn't particularly in the mood to speak to Herbert, but fleeing the scene would just have been bad form. \"Trubshaw,\" he managed at last. \"You look like you've been well.\" \"Have you been well?\" Herbert asked, concerned. \"I know you probably don't want to speak to me – \" \"Whatever gave you that idea?\" It came out far more sarcastic than Archibald had intended. \"Well…you know.\" Herbert's tone grew hushed. \"You weren't…there. At our wedding. And the time that's passed since then.\" They both became aware that the produce vendor was listening in with eager ears to hear this gossip, and unanimously, wordlessly decided to continue their conversation on a trek away from that stand. \"I've had important business,\" Archibald said coldly as he turned toward the street. \"Snatcher's Stitches won't run itself, you know.\" \"Is it something I've done?\" Herbert asked. \"If it is, I sincerely apologize.\" \"Oh, come now, don't do that,\" Archibald sighed. \"It's absolutely beginning to grate my nerves.\" \"What is?\" \"You being holier-than-thou on every matter that concerns you.\" \"I'm not trying to be holier-than-thou,\" Herbert insisted. \"I'm merely trying to figure out where I went wrong, that my dearest friend isn't speaking to me!\" \"Your dearest friend, am I?\" Archibald countered. \"After Miss Travis, of course. Oh, I do apologize. MRS. Trubshaw, now, she is.\" \"It was never meant to be a competition between you,\" Herbert pleaded. \"I know the two of you never got on, but I do love both of you – \" \"You only seem to be married to one of us. And what about your little friends - \" His voice went hushed: \"Underground? I suppose you've only become closer to them. You're practically one of them anyway.\" \"They're dear to me, of course,\" Herbert sputtered. \"The point is, Archibald, I never meant to lose you by loving anyone else! If I've hurt you, if I've wronged you in any way, then please, tell me what I've done so I can make amends!\" Archibald badly wanted to have a fair argument against Herbert, to tell him exactly what made him such a reprehensible person and a terrible friend. But he didn't. All he had was a man desperate to reclaim the bond he'd lost, and who was doing quite a wonderful job at communicating his own kindness. When Archibald said \"You've nothing to apologize for,\" he knew it was true. \"Choosing the Portley-Rind wedding over yours was my decision.\" \"But why, Archibald?\" \"You mean after all this time, you still don't know?\" Archibald replied, somewhat in disbelief. \"It was the next step toward the White Hat, Herbert! The most influential family in all of Cheesebridge now owes the success of its heir's wedding to the Snatchers! Can't you imagine what that will do for us?\" \"And is that why you've ignored me since then?\" Herbert asked, his voice suddenly taking on an edge. \"Because speaking to me won't get you any closer to that White Hat you've dreamed of?\" \"Perhaps it is.\" \"Why is it so important to you, Archibald?\" \"Why is a White Hat important?\" Archibald was flabbergasted. \"It comes with power! It comes with prestige! It comes with wealth and influence! It comes with everything I've been denied my whole life!\" \"Except for love and friendship,\" Herbert said softly. \"You had that. It wasn't enough, though, was it?\" The silence was deafening before Archibald said, \"You realize it wasn't supposed to be this way. We were supposed to achieve greatness together. But you gave it up the moment you met Mrs. Trubshaw née Travis. You settled. You decided my dreams were just too good for you.\" \"That…that isn't entirely true, Archibald,\" Herbert stated, his tone now growing shaky. \"I thought…perhaps we could live out our lives the way we wanted and stop caring what everyone thinks about us. So long as we had each other, the White Hat wouldn't matter. We could follow our dreams in our own ways. I would continue to invent, even if my inventions never became famed or used by the White Hats. And you…you always did write such beautiful poetry. You could have been a writer. Or an artist, with the way you crafted all of the gowns at your family's shop. Or even an actor. And Marjorie…well, we won't speak of Marjorie if you don't want to hear it, but she would have been my wife all the same, and she would have been able to live the same way, doing what she loves no matter what anyone thinks. And Fish and Shoe, they could be with us too, instead of having to run and hide from every human aboveground. We, all of us, could have had – we could STILL have a wonderful life together, making things and being ourselves!\" \"And what's brought all this on?\" Archibald snapped. \"You were always the first to champion that my family might actually do it, you know! That I myself, Archibald Snatcher, might – \" \"You would NEVER have earned that hat, Archibald, and you KNOW it!\" Herbert finally snapped. Archibald was taken aback, giving Herbert an absolutely stunned look. He had absolutely never seen this side of Herbert before and was almost curious to plumb the depths of his anger. \"What…is THAT…supposed to mean?\" \"It means the White Hats are terrible people who only care about keeping the hats in their own families, or buying their way into power!\" Herbert ranted. \"They've always thought of you as so much lesser than you are, and that's all they'll EVER see you as! To them, you don't have the look, the manners, or the money, and you never will! And it isn't because you aren't worthy; it's because they're pigheaded and short-sighted! No amount of hemming wedding gowns is going to change that, Archibald! I'm sorry to have to speak ill of your dream, but that's all it will EVER be! Just…a…dream! And the sooner you WAKE UP from it, the sooner you'll finally be happy with your life!\" \"YOU DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT WHITE HATS!\" Archibald roared in retaliation. \"AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT ME, IF YOU THINK I CAN'T GET THEM TO SEE WHAT I DESERVE! YOU NEVER THOUGHT THIS BEFORE YOU MET THAT WOMAN, AND LOOK WHAT YOU'VE BECOME! HER HOLLOWED-OUT PUPPET THAT SHE USES TO SAY HER WORDS THROUGH!\" \"THAT'S NOT TRUE!\" Herbert yelled. \"SHE DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND! SHE JUST MADE ME REALIZE WHAT I HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG!\" Now the silence was not so much deafening as it was the equivalent of something strong breaking unexpectedly in two. Archibald took a few breaths before he was able to formulate his response: \"You've…thought this from the very start? You thought I…that my family would NEVER be able to achieve power? And you let me believe you supported me.\" \"You wanted it so badly,\" Herbert said weakly. \"I suppose I talked myself into it because of that. I wanted you to be happy. But it's been so long, Archibald. We aren't children anymore. We know how this town works. We know how the WORLD works. And we can't go on pretending. The good news is that we don't need the White Hats or their approval in order to be happy. Because I've been thinking it over, and I realized…things like hats, they're not what make you who you are. YOU make – \" \"Don't ever speak to me again.\" Herbert was immediately filled with regret. \"But, Archibald – \" \"Don't EVER speak to me AGAIN!\" Giving Herbert a rough shove aside, Archibald stormed quickly back toward his family's shop. Thoughts of remorse filled Herbert's mind: that he could have found a way to put his musings into words more tactfully, more gently. He thought about running after his friend, calling out to him, asking forgiveness, asking to clarify his point, asking simply to talk about it instead of yelling about it. But he knew that if he did any such thing, he would only be met with hard-headed resistance. Archibald Snatcher had made up his mind, and Herbert knew him well enough to realize his decision was final. They were no longer friends. And furthermore, Archibald realized with a final breath of relief, he no longer had any feelings for Herbert in any capacity beyond that. ... Years passed. Muddy springs solidified into warm summers, which rotted into withering autumns and froze over into cold winters. The sun rose and set and rose and set only to rise again, and one chilly autumn day, it rose over the grave of Gabriel Spencer Snatcher, buried at the side of his long-dead wife Amelia. The funeral was small, but hardly intimate. It sickened Archibald to see how few people had come to mourn their tailor. Their town had practically run on his work, and yet they refused to acknowledge his importance by so much as turning up for his passing. Verses were read over the grave, and a priest wished Gabriel safe passage into the afterlife. The people eventually grew bored and began leaving during the readings until Archibald was the only one left. And then the priest took his leave as well; Archibald stood alone over the graves of his parents. What had they worked for? This he wondered as he read their headstones: only their names and \"Beloved Husband/Beloved Wife.\" Nothing of their accomplishments had been documented. They had not been viewed as noteworthy in the slightest. And of course, no one had thought to even try and console their son, though Archibald would have tried to strangle anyone who attempted to do such a thing. After all the work the Snatchers had put into dressing the citizens of Cheesebridge, was this how they were to be repaid? With a quiet passing into an unremarkable grave, with no White Hat, with hardly even any money to their name? Archibald felt his eyes truly open then. Perhaps, in his own way, Herbert had been right. Lord Charles Portley-Rind, for he was now Lord of the city, had never respected the Snatchers. Archibald himself didn't know how much time he had left to secure a position if he was to secure one at all. Certainly, a whole lifetime would never be enough to impress Lord Portley-Rind. He never would have the right look, the right manners, the right money. Seeing the unadorned headstones of his parents burned this harsh truth into his heart. There truly was only one way to win the game, and in order to do so, Archibald would have to change his entire strategy. He turned and made his way from the cemetery. There were preparations to be made. If they wouldn't give him a White Hat for merit, he would simply have to do what he'd learned as the son of a tailor: rip Cheesebridge apart at the seams. ... Archibald wasn't the only one to have lost someone and be thrust into sobering realizations because of it. In the upper floors of the general hospital, Herbert Trubshaw sat, practically curled up into a ball over a small bundle in his arms. Every now and again, his body was wracked with a terrible sob. It was supposed to be one of the happiest days of his life: the birth of his and Marjorie's child. He hadn't been able to conceal his glee when he rushed Marjorie to medical aid, and she too had been joyous, talking to the small form within her own body, telling it she was excited to meet whoever it turned out to be. But then, during the birth, complications had arisen. And though the orderlies had done their best, there had been no saving Marjorie. Only the child. As Herbert wept for the loss of his love, the tiny baby let out a loud wail. Herbert forced himself to stem the flow of his tears; he was now the only parent the child, a boy, had, and now he had to be strong for him. \"It's all right, Arthur,\" he said shakily, his voice breaking. He knew it wouldn't be long before he found himself weeping again. \"I know things may seem awful, but I…I'm here for you…and I will take care of you to the very best of my ability. I love you, Arthur.\" One of the staff gingerly approached. \"Mr. Trubshaw…\" \"I know.\" Herbert stood, cradling Arthur gently, quivering at the knees. \"I need to move along, don't I?\" \"That would be best, Mr. Trubshaw. You can make funeral arrangements with – \" \"I know, I know.\" Herbert gave a polite nod. \"Thank you, at least, for trying to save her.\" On his way out of the hospital, he continued to mutter assurances to the child: \"It's only you and me now. But we'll be all right. You and I can make it.\" And as he reached his house, he began to sing. He had no sense of rhythm, and his pitch was terrible. Anyone else who may have heard the song might have mocked him for it. But Arthur was calmed by the sound, and by the time Herbert lay the child down in his crib, the baby boy was fast asleep. \"Goodnight, Arthur,\" Herbert bade him. \"I do truly love you. And we will be all right.\" Then he turned to his own bed, which, without Marjorie, was all too wide and empty.[Chapter 8] 8. Destruction Versus Acquisition The first thing Archibald Snatcher attended to was the coat. If he couldn't look perfect, at least he could stand out visually; give Lord Portley-Rind something that would burn his image into the lord's memory. And so he took to the sewing floor of Snatcher's Stitches, rolling out a thick red fabric, cutting and piecing together a magnificent tailed coat of scarlet. When all was done, he donned the coat before a mirror, admiring himself. The sight didn't please him as much as the image of Madame Frou Frou did, but it wasn't shabby at all, to his mind. Though it did seem to be missing a certain something. Casting his gaze about the shop, Archibald noticed a tall, somewhat crooked red top hat in the corner. He couldn't remember exactly what the hat had been made for, but it had obviously never sold. No one had wanted something so garish. Archibald swiped the hat and perched it atop his head, turning back to the mirror. Now he looked even taller, more elegant, more memorable. Lord Portley-Rind would come to associate that red hat with him, and all for the better. He couldn't have guessed how much he would come to resent being associated with that red hat. And yet he would never let it go until the White Hat was in his hands. As he walked out, he closed and locked the doors of Snatcher's Stitches for the last time. A new family would soon take up the trade of town tailors and dressmakers, and the Snatcher legacy of working with fabric would be absolutely forgotten in place of something new and horrifying. ... In the darkest hours of the night, Herbert Trubshaw was awake, gently rocking Arthur to try and calm a fit of crankiness that had overcome the child. He paced up and down the halls slowly, singing softly, tunelessly, to his beloved son. There was a soft knock upon the door. Cautious, Herbert proceeded toward the entryway. The knock sounded again. \"Hello?\" Herbert called out. The knock came a third time, and Herbert realized that whomever was knocking could only reach as high as halfway up the door. That narrowed down considerably who could have come to visit. Herbert gladly flung the door open to see Fish and Shoe standing before him; they spread their arms wide and said a word that Herbert knew translated to \"CONGRATULATIONS!\" Neither Boxtroll understood, at first, why Herbert burst into tears upon viewing the gesture. Fish gently asked if everything was all right, pointing out that he had expected Herbert to be happy because of his new son. Shoe, in the meantime, just brought out how annoyingly loud the baby was. \"I am happy to have him,\" Herbert said softly between his tears. \"So very happy. He's the most precious person in the whole world to me. But Marjorie…she…\" He swallowed hard; he wasn't sure he could ever find the words to express it. Then, at last, he confessed, \"She's gone.\" Fish asked, gingerly, whether she had merely left, or if she had suffered a more permanent fate. \"Dead,\" Herbert confirmed, feeling the blow to his heart all over again. Fish and Shoe were both taken aback. They looked to each other, not sure how to proceed, exactly. Then Fish trod forward softly, tugging on Herbert's sleeve. Herbert knelt, and Fish enveloped him as best he could in an embrace of comfort. After rolling his eyes, Shoe joined in as well, and the three of them remained in that position for some time, with the squalling Arthur at the center. Fish burbled that he was very, very sorry to hear of Herbert's loss. \"It'll be all right,\" Herbert said, and as he did, his tears finally abated. \"It will have to be all right.\" Fish insisted that Herbert wouldn't be alone at all; he, Shoe, and the other Boxtrolls would be there for him. \"Thank you,\" Herbert said gratefully. \"Thank you so much.\" Shoe just grumbled that this had better not mean that he would have to take care of the baby, which was still far too loud. ... It was with a heavy heart that Royce Pickles knocked on the door of the house he shared with his constant companion. Said companion, one Edward Trout, answered the door and remarked, \"You're home early.\" \"Yes, well…\" Pickles sighed. He gave the chimney-sweep's brush in his hand a halfhearted spin. \"It seems I won't be needing this anymore.\" \"They fired you?\" Trout asked in concern. Pickles nodded. \"Come in, then,\" Trout encouraged, beckoning for Pickles to enter the small abode. \"We'll get you a spot of tea, and that'll make things look better.\" \"Don't know that we'll be able to afford tea much longer,\" Pickles sighed as he followed Trout inside. Once Pickles was seated at the small, rickety table, Trout, pouring him a steaming cup of tea, asked, \"So what happened this time?\" \"The same thing that always happens, I'm afraid,\" Pickles sighed. \"They found out about us. And I was being so careful to keep it a secret. But with the number of employers we've both gone through, everyone in town must know by now.\" \"Maybe…well, maybe we shouldn't…\" Trout began, but found he couldn't finish the sentence. \"Be together?\" Pickles completed it for him. \"But the thought of that's worse than the thought of never being employed in this town again.\" \"I know,\" Trout agreed. \"I was thinking the same thing. That's why I didn't finish the sentence, you see.\" He took a moment to press a brief kiss to the side of Pickles' face before taking a seat across from him at the table with his own cup of tea. \"Do you remember when we were younger, and we used to dream of being heroes that would be celebrated throughout the whole town?\" Pickles asked. \"Defeating great evils, saving the town from peril?\" \"Seems so long ago,\" Trout said with a nod. \"But I remember.\" He took a pensive sip of tea. \"Couldn't be further away from that, now, could we?\" Pickles sighed. \"Here's a thought,\" Trout said suddenly. \"We can't leave each other. That's not an option. But everyone in town knows, well, that we're with each other. What if we left here and found another town? We might be able to keep our secret better there. Get real jobs.\" \"A capital idea, Mr. Trout!\" Pickles affirmed; much like Archibald, both of them had been so conditioned to referring to others by their surnames for respect that they had trouble even using each other's first names, intimate as they were with each other, and had both gotten used to being referred to by surnames affectionately. \"Maybe there's even a place out there where they'll accept us for who we are. A place where two men in love isn't strange.\" \"It'll be an adventure to find it!\" Trout declared. \"If we can't be heroes, the least we can be is adventurers!\" And they might have begun their great adventure that very night if the insistent rapping hadn't come upon their door just then. \"A visitor?\" Pickles turned to look at the door, perplexed. \"But no one visits us.\" The rapping came again, and a pleasant-sounding baritone called out, \"Gentlemen! Mr. Trout! Mr. Pickles!\" Exchanging looks of suspicion, both Trout and Pickles got up to answer the unexpected caller. Upon opening the door, Pickles told the visitor, \"Er…yes, that is us. Can we help you?\" Archibald Snatcher grinned at the pair, and neither could truly read his expression. \"I had heard that the two of you had been suffering some…misfortune,\" Archibald began. \"You don't know the half of it,\" Trout sighed. \"Let me hazard a guess, at least,\" Archibald said playfully. \"Run out of occupation after occupation because no one wants to employ a queer man. Afraid it's a disease that'll catch, they are. Absolutely no respect for the fact that you're lovers whatsoever.\" \"How did you – \" Pickles began. \"Oh, everyone in town knows by now,\" Archibald stated. \"One needs only pay attention to recent gossip.\" \"I knew it,\" Trout sighed. \"I have decided, however,\" Archibald continued, \"out of the kindness of my heart, to take pity on you poor luckless gentlemen.\" It had very little to do with kindness and more to do with the fact that he needed help to pull off his plan, and the easiest way to acquire help was to prey upon those in town who were further outcast than even Archibald was. \"I've a job offer for both of you, if you're willing to take it.\" \"A job?\" Trout repeated, as he and Pickles exchanged looks yet again, unable to believe what they were hearing. \"For us?\" \"What sort of job?\" Pickles asked, turning back to look at Archibald. \"This town is plagued by a great evil,\" Archibald explained with a smug grin. \"One that we have feared for years, and yet not done a single thing about. No one has yet been brave enough to stand up to the cannibalistic, savage force that lurks beneath our very streets! No one, that is, save myself, Archibald Snatcher! It is my intent to save Cheesebridge from this impending threat, but of course, I cannot do it alone. I need at least three men of strong mettle. Men who can be heroes.\" \"We've always wanted to be heroes!\" Pickles said excitedly. \"What sort of evil are we talking about, exactly?\" Trout asked. \"Gentlemen,\" Archibald revealed, \"we are going to kill the Boxtrolls.\" Trout and Pickles both gasped and flinched. \"But the Boxtrolls…well…they eat people,\" Pickles stammered. \"They're pure evil. We can't possibly stand up to them!\" \"Oh, but we can,\" Snatcher insisted, thinking back on the docile interactions between Herbert, Fish, and Shoe, \"and we will. If we don't make this town safe for our children to play in the streets, than who will? And if we don't act fast, the Boxtrolls may very well do something horrible that we'll wish we could have prevented. They could…steal a child.\" \"No!\" Pickles cried. \"Yes, I'm afraid,\" Archibald said with a solemn nod. \"Will you join me in this noble quest as Boxtroll exterminators?\" \"I…don't know…\" Trout said tentatively. \"Well, all right, then,\" Archibald replied. \"I can see when my offer isn't welcomed. I'll find other men, of course. Good luck finding another job, fellows! From what I've heard, oh, you'll need it.\" He turned as though to walk away, knowing all the while he would be stopped. \"Wait!\" Pickles called after him. Archibald halted, smiling due to the knowledge that everything was going exactly as planned. \"I'll do it,\" Pickles volunteered. \"I'll join you in defeating the Boxtrolls.\" \"And so will I,\" Trout agreed. \"Maybe…if we save this town from Boxtrolls…they'll actually like us.\" \"My thoughts exactly, my good sirs!\" Archibald said gladly, turning back to face them and shake each of their hands in turn. \"No matter what you may have done or been, how can anyone say no to their heroes? Once our work is done, you'll have people lining up at your door to request your services helping them with problems great and small, and offering a wealth of riches for it! Why, if all goes as well as planned…no, no, that's just a speculation. I mustn't say it out loud. Don't want to get your hopes up, after all…\" \"What is it?\" Trout asked. \"You can't just say a thing like that and not explain it.\" \"Well, if you insist,\" Archibald replied. \"If all goes as planned, our heroic deed will earn all of us…White Hats.\" \"White Hats!\" Pickles was taken aback. \"We've never even dreamed we could be White Hats.\" \"Then you haven't dreamed big enough, quite obviously,\" Archibald stated cavalierly. \"Rescuing Cheesebridge from the ultimate evil will of course be enough to earn us those coveted hats. Then you won't even need jobs.\" \"This all sounds very exciting,\" Trout replied. \"Almost too good to be true.\" \"That's how most good things seem, Mr. Trout,\" Archibald cajoled. \"Now. I've got both of you on board, but I'll need at least one more. Where can I find another man down on his luck, who needs a helping hand, but who has great untapped potential for heroics?\" \"Can't think of anyone off the top of my head,\" Trout stated. \"Well…\" Pickles thought it over. \"There is the madman who lives atop the hill. He's got to be the most unfortunate man in town. But I don't know if you'll be able to talk to him. He's a bit…odd.\" \"Oddness from a madman is to be expected,\" Archibald stated with a nod. \"Tell me more.\" ... The case of Cuthbert Gristle was tragic. No one knew exactly what made his mind so different from others in town; no one had the language for it besides such terms as \"madman.\" And as such, no one knew what to do for him, how to care for him. His parents had died young, and he lived alone in what had once been their house, with no visitors; no one dared come close. He could occasionally be glimpsed around town taking care of basic errands; he spoke in one-word sentences. And about him, there seemed to be a sense of inexplicable glee that caused discomfort in others, for he wasn't cheered up by such things as the sun shining on a warm summer day or being greeted by a friend, but instead stepping on the tails of alley cats and knocking over piles of groceries in the shops. The people of Cheesebridge feared him, worrying that at his core, there lurked something very sinister. In truth, what was sinister about him was lured out of him, molded by an outside circumstance that wished to take advantage of him. That circumstance turned up on his doorstep dressed in scarlet. \"Mr. Gristle, I presume?\" Archibald Snatcher asked. Gristle was at first just stunned by Archibald's vibrant appearance. \"Red!\" he commented. \"Quite,\" Archibald agreed, wondering if he was to regret this alliance before it had even begun. \"Now, tell me, Mr. Gristle. Have you ever wished to be a hero?\" \"Hero?\" Gristle replied. \"Have you fantasized about the glory that would befall you,\" Archibald continued, \"if you were responsible for the extermination of all Boxtrolls, which are perhaps the most monstrous evil to ever poison this town?\" \"Ex…terminate?\" Gristle wasn't sure. \"Exterminate,\" Archibald repeated. \"Eliminate. Annihilate. DESTROY.\" \"Ohhhh, destroy!\" Gristle nodded. Out front of his abode, a bat lay propped up against the wall, and near it were some cardboard boxes from things he'd purchased. Gristle, eager to demonstrate to this stranger what he'd just heard, took the bat into hand and began striking the boxes flat with it. \"DESTROY!\" As he watched Gristle beat the boxes into ruination from which there was no return, Archibald's smile grew wider and wickeder. \"Exactly, Mr. Gristle,\" he muttered. \"Destroy.\" ... And so Archibald came to the final phases of his plan, in which he knew he would need one last piece, one he was loath to acquire. But there was literally no one else who could put the scheme into motion as it was scripted. He trusted no one else but Gristle to accompany him on the quest to put the final piece in place. He knew quite well that things could easily turn ugly, and the likes of Pickles and Trout would be offput and doubt Archibald's intentions if his hand were forced. He needed them to trust him, believe in him. Gristle's loyalty didn't hinge on the same sort of upstanding morals. And if a rougher hand was required, Archibald knew Gristle would back him up rather than try to talk him down. And so, with Gristle in tow, Archibald knocked on Herbert Trubshaw's door. His old friend answered, and Archibald was pleased to find that this time, his heart rate stayed stagnant. Herbert's expression was likened to one who had seen the dead come back to life. \"Archibald…?\" he said softly, stunned. \"Hello, Trubshaw,\" Archibald said innocently. \"It's been a while, hasn't it?\" \"It's been years,\" Herbert reminded him. \"Have you got any time to catch up with an old friend?\" Archibald asked. \"I…I thought I was never to speak to you again,\" Herbert told him. \"I may have said some very foolish things in the past,\" Archibald replied. \"But let's just let bygones be bygones, shall we? I have so missed your company.\" \"Well, then, by all means!\" Herbert's face lit up. He then turned his attention to Archibald's new companion; \"And who might you be?\" \"Gristle!\" Gristle put out his right hand; Herbert grasped it and shook it firmly. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gristle!\" Herbert said, sincere as always. \"Come inside, both of you! I'll put a kettle on.\" Herbert readied a table on the upper floor, and as he did so, he was made aware of Arthur crying out from the adjacent room. Herbert quickly rushed to gather his son into an arm, carrying the babe with him as he set about making and pouring tea. \"So this is your bouncing baby boy, is it?\" Archibald said as he looked over small Arthur. Babies disgusted him, he decided on the spot. This one in particular was drooling most uncouthly. \"His name is Arthur,\" Herbert introduced lovingly. \"Arthur, this is Archibald. He's an old friend.\" Arthur made some babbling sounds in reply. Archibald grimaced. Once all were seated, Herbert still cradling Arthur, Archibald stated, \"To tell you the truth, I had wished to discuss a matter of business with you, Trubshaw.\" \"Business?\" Herbert asked. \"Of what sort?\" Here came the difficult part of the endeavor. \"I've decided to take my career in a…new direction,\" Archibald began. \"And in order to do that, I have realized, I am going to need a machine. I've never been gifted at all with such things, but you…you always were so talented with mechanics.\" Herbert's face fell; Archibald could tell he was disappointed that Archibald had only showed up because he wanted something. Still, Herbert wasn't going to turn him away without hearing him out. \"What sort of machine did you need?\" \"An indestructible one of great size,\" Archibald described, \"from which a man might tower over the whole town. Something built to capture. And, if needed, destroy. In other words, your greatest mechanical doohickey yet.\" Herbert was taken aback. \"And for whatever would you need something like THAT?\" Archibald had rehearsed various lies for this part, but, looking into Herbert's eyes, he once again succumbed to weakness. Herbert could no longer make his heart race; he could, however, turn Archibald into an honest man. \"It's my plan to take the White Hat,\" he stated. \"I'm finally going to do it, Herbert. But in order to do it, I shall need some…leverage. It occurred to me like a bolt from the blue: your Boxtrolls! If I were to destroy them in one fell swoop in front of Lord Portley-Rind, he'd have no choice but to give me the White Hat! Hasn't this town been running scared of the little beasts ever since we were children? What if they were suddenly gone? Would the one who rid the town of them not become the most celebrated man in all Cheesebridge? Or, should I say, the ONES who rid the town of them become the most celebrated MEN in all Cheesebridge? Think of it, Trubshaw!\" Herbert's teacup shattered against the floor. \"You can't be saying what I think you're saying,\" Herbert said shakily. \"My friends. Fish. Shoe. You want to…you want to kill them.\" \"You still believe yourself friends with those monsters?\" Archibald scoffed. \"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. But you do know, Trubshaw, they'll never be human. If you're waiting for them to be worth your time – \" \"They ARE worth my time, Archibald. They've been worth my time from the moment I met them,\" Herbert insisted. \"They may not be human, but they are PEOPLE. People like you and me.\" Archibald shook his head. \"I truly thought you were more intelligent than that, Trubshaw.\" Herbert rose angrily from his seat; \"And I thought YOU were more intelligent than THIS! You really think you can earn a White Hat for bloodthirst? Lord Portley-Rind will see right through you! What if killing innocents gets you absolutely NOTHING in return? What will become of you then?\" \"Why, then I will have a machine of terrible destruction, of course,\" Archibald said casually, \"and if they won't listen to me for saving their town from the Boxtroll menace, then they WILL listen to me when I hold THEIR lives in my hands. Of course, I should hate for it to come to that. I do so wish for them to grant me the White Hat with true respect. But if I can't have that, I suppose I can settle. You know what they say about it being better to be feared than loved.\" \"You're mad,\" Herbert accused. \"You were never like this. The Archibald Snatcher I knew would never cause a genocide just to acquire power. The Archibald Snatcher I knew was a kind man and a loyal friend.\" \"The Archibald Snatcher you knew was young, misguided, and weak,\" Archibald insisted, rising to look down upon Herbert. \"I've learned something, Herbert. I've learned you were right about the White Hats. They never will reward my efforts to please them by doing honest work for this town. No, to them, so long as I play their game, I'll always be ugly, queer Archibald Snatcher, the lowborn tailor's son. But there is a way to win this game, Herbert, and that's to cheat! Don't you see? This doesn't just have to be about me!\" He was surprised at his own sincerity in the next words he spoke: \"It can be for both of us! Look at you! Without Mrs. Trubshaw, you've nothing left! But it can be the way it used to be: you and I together! We can turn this town on its head, Trubshaw! Envision it: White Hats for the both of us! Together, WE can be the heroes of the story! Or, failing that, WE will be the villains! Either way, you and I will finally win! All I need is your help, Trubshaw!\" Archibald's eyes glimmered with greed, and Herbert backed away, holding Arthur protectively. \"No,\" Herbert said softly, hardly daring to look his former friend in the eye. \"No…no, I won't do it. I never WANTED that sort of power, Archibald. All I wanted was to be happy. I never wanted to win. And I won't win. Not if that's what it takes.\" Archibald's expression immediately soured. \"I've been reasonable,\" he growled. \"I can be UNreasonable.\" Herbert finally found his voice: \"I'm an inventor! NOT A KILLER!\" Slowly, the smile spread back over Archibald's face. His eyes flicked down to tiny Arthur. He knew what would get Herbert to crack. \"Maybe…if I hold onto your son – \" Archibald reached out to grab the child; Herbert shoved him roughly back, shouting, \"NOT MY SON!\" Gristle, catching on to Archibald's intent, had crept around to Herbert's other side, and lunged at him; Herbert planted a deft kick in Gristle's chest, sending him flying across the room. Herbert now knew there was no talking Archibald down from the evil that had overtaken him, and he knew he had to remove Arthur's safety from the equation as quickly as possible. He rushed to the window, where he, Fish, and Shoe had set up a pulley system with a bucket for trading tools and building supplies through said window. The last few things the Boxtrolls had given him had come up in a spare box, one first fashioned to deliver eggs, and it was in this box that Herbert quickly nestled Arthur, looking down to the street. Fish and Shoe were watching from below, eyes wide with horror. Herbert wondered how much they'd seen, how much they'd heard, how much they knew. The window would have given them a pretty good view, and his argument with Archibald had become loud. He prayed that they knew the imminent danger enough to get Arthur as far away from the situation as they could. The pulley was let down, and Arthur, \"eggs\" box and all, was lowered to the street. \"RUN!\" Herbert screamed at Fish and Shoe. \"TAKE MY SON!\" Gristle's arms wrapped around him from behind, pulling him back. He heard Arthur crying from the street below. Herbert's penchant for inventing had caused him to leave all sorts of tools around the house. On the tea table, next to a half-finished device featuring a propeller, lay a wrench. Archibald seized both opportunity and the wrench, charging the struggling Herbert and Gristle, raising the wrench high over Herbert's head. Herbert turned just in time to look up and see what was about to happen to him. \"Archibald, NO – \" The wrench came down hard. Not hard enough to kill, but hard enough to knock Herbert senseless. As Herbert slumped unconsciously to the floor, Archibald rushed to the window. Perhaps his leverage wasn't gone. Perhaps the boy was still within reach. His gaze met Fish's for a moment. Then, before Archibald could react, Fish had swept up Arthur and begun to run, the shadows concealing his destination from Archibald. A thousand hypothetical undoings began to rush through Archibald's mind. That child was a liability, so long as he went unfound. He was proof of what had happened. But at the same time, Archibald realized, the child was an opportunity. For all intents and purposes, the Boxtrolls had done exactly what he'd wanted. They had taken a child. And he knew how to tell the story in his own favor. Gristle hovered over Herbert's head, holding the teapot high above it, ready to smash. \"Destroy?\" he asked. \"…No,\" Archibald told him after some thought. \"Not destroy. Acquire. We still need him, Mr. Gristle. And we'll need those Boxtrolls of his after all. How did it not occur to me before? Trubshaw's mind is useless without their little hands.\" He turned away from the window. \"Help me carry him out of here.\" \"Trout?\" Gristle asked. \"Pickles?\" \"Need only know this was a liar and a wicked, wicked man who is best brought to justice,\" Archibald told him, \"and that his helping us build our machine is his penance for his crimes. Just as putting the Boxtrolls to work is penance for their crimes.\" \"Put to work?\" \"Yes, Mr. Gristle. Put to work. We shall need to acquire them as well. All of them. Now, help me move Trubshaw! We'd best get a move on! After all, I have a visit to pay Lord Portley-Rind. The unspeakable has happened, and we must speak of it immediately.\" ... When Herbert came to, he was utterly perplexed. First of all, he was upside-down. Looking up – or was it down? – he found that his feet were encased in metal boots that were stuck to a great magnetic plate. Second, he seemed to be located in a basement of some sort. It was spacious, but very dark. \"Comfortable, are we?\" The voice startled Herbert, and he could make out a silhouette leaning against the wall across the room. Even upside-down, he knew the shape well. \"Archibald. Where am I?\" All the memories came rushing back of Archibald's surprise visit, of his revelation of his sinister plan, of how he'd attacked Herbert. Herbert hoped beyond hope that was all somehow just a terrible dream, but given the current circumstances, that seemed ever more unlikely. \"Now, does that really matter?\" Archibald asked him mockingly. \"Though you might be interested to know that I got the idea for that magnet and those iron socks from the late Mrs. Trubshaw. Seems she had one or two good ideas after all.\" \"Archibald,\" Herbert pleaded, \"don't do this. You…you can do whatever you want to me. But don't hurt the Boxtrolls. Don't hurt the people of Cheesebridge. And please, PLEASE, Archibald…don't hurt my son.\" \"Your son is dead,\" Archibald stated. \"Or, at least, he is as far as anyone else is concerned. And he will most certainly be dead when I catch up to him. In the meantime, the tragedy of the Trubshaw Baby and his father will be known throughout all Cheesebridge. Everyone will come to know the tale of how the Boxtrolls ruthlessly cannibalized the both of them.\" \"They'll never believe you,\" Herbert spat. \"Won't they?\" Archibald countered. \"No, I suppose not. They never did listen to me. Oh, if only there were someone around who would be taken seriously. Wait. There is.\" He chuckled. \"And her name is Madame Frou Frou. Oh, don't doubt for a second that Lord Portley-Rind isn't smitten with 'her.' How's that for irony, Trubshaw?\" \"You know I won't help you with your infernal machine,\" Herbert growled. \"We'll see how you feel after you've spent some time in that position,\" Archibald told him. \"After all, I don't intend to let you right-side-up until we're done. But it isn't all going to be bad, old friend. See, if you help me out, I'll let you have all the jelly your little heart of gold desires!\" \"Archibald…\" And now the tears came, running out of Herbert's eyes and trickling up over his forehead. \"We were friends.\" At that, Archibald made his way to the door of the basement without a word. He paused just before his exit, turning to look over his shoulder at Herbert. \"We were,\" he confirmed, \"weren't we?\" Then, utterly satisfied with himself, he ascended the stairs, leaving Herbert to sob in solitude.[Chapter 9] 9. Jelly Ten years after that, a plot was stopped in its tracks. Its evil was with righteousness matched. A broken town was finally patched, and by deadly greed was Snatcher snatched. Boxtrolls and humans didn't quite live in peace, but they were getting there; Boxtrolls were now welcomed on the surface and taking jobs as repairpeople and inventors. The White Hats remained in power, but the people seemed to have been disillusioned with them ever so slightly, and the seed had been planted of curiosity as to just what power a hat held. Tales were no longer told of the horrid kidnapping of the Trubshaw Baby, but instead what Eggs Trubshaw, having adopted a more Boxtroll moniker than \"Arthur\" to reflect his nature as a bridge between Boxtrolls and humans, had done in order to free Cheesebridge from Archibald Snatcher's lies and lift the ever-present curfew. As for Eggs himself, he and his long-estranged father, the man once known as Herbert – who had been shaken up a little by spending ten years upside down, but really didn't consider himself that much more odd than he had been before – rode a great wheeled machine, one stolen from the Red Hats but which had been based on Herbert's old prototype, throughout town, offering repairs on broken objects and trade-ins for items that people considered \"junk.\" Herbert, much like Arthur, had abandoned his name in favor of something he felt suited him better, and preferred to be addressed as \"Jelly\" by friends, family, and strangers alike. As the vehicle rounded the corner on one sunny summer day, Eggs tugged at his father's sleeve, pointing toward a stage set up in the one of the town circuses; \"Father, look! Winnie's telling our story again! Can we watch?\" \"Most certainly!\" Jelly replied, pulling the vehicle to a halt. Eggs and Jelly squeezed their way into the crowd, ending up at about the middle of it in time to hear Winifred Portley-Rind giving her overly dramatic rendition of events: \"And then, just as all seemed to be going well for our misfit heroes, the monstrous Snatcher burst from the brie-hemoth, swollen to twice – no, three times his size, and with a thirst for blood! He demanded a White Hat, or the street would run red with gore!\" \"He never said that,\" Eggs laughed. \"Good old Winnie. I love it when she puts in things like that. Don't you?\" Jelly didn't answer. He hadn't realized, after all this time, how much hearing the retellings would affect him. His son and Winnie had known Archibald Snatcher the monster. And, in the end, that is what Archibald Snatcher had become; Herbert had finally come to accept it after living as his captive. And yet, somewhere deep within Jelly's heart, there echoed the laugh of two adolescent boys skating on the river. \"Father?\" Eggs asked. \"Are you all right?\" \"And then…\" Winnie paused her tale to let the audience drink in the suspense of what had taken place in the Tasting Room. \"The villain EXPLODED! Blood and guts rained from the heavens and doused us! It was absolutely WONDERF – horrible. It was completely horrible.\" So that was how it ended, Jelly thought. Archibald was dead, and if there had been any hope left for him, it was all gone now. He wondered if he should have been in that room, if he should have seen it happen. He knew he couldn't have stopped it. Eggs had tried, and for that, Jelly admired him – partly for trying to save Jelly's old friend, and partly for attempting to appeal to good in someone who had been corrupted by pure evil. Eggs was a very smart and kind child, and Jelly looked forward to seeing what he would become as he grew older. \"Father,\" Eggs observed, \"you're crying.\" \"Am I?\" Jelly touched his cheek to feel the dampness of the single tear he'd let loose. \"What's wrong?\" Eggs asked in concern. \"You and Winnie are such good friends,\" Jelly stated. Eggs nodded enthusiastically. \"We are!\" \"I hope your friendship endures for a long, long time,\" Jelly said somberly. \"Why wouldn't it?\" Eggs asked. Jelly shook his head. \"There's a sad story I know about two friends. But it can wait for another day, when it isn't so beautiful. This isn't the kind of day to ruin by telling sad stories!\" One day, he knew, Eggs would have to know the truth. But he wasn't yet ready to tell that tale. Besides, it truly was a gorgeous day, and not one Jelly wanted to sully by dwelling on painful memories. Winnie hopped off the stage, and Eggs rushed to greet her and congratulate her on her storytelling. Jelly watched the two of them with a bittersweet smile. He did ever so wish their story would have a happy ending. ~End~ ","Summary":" 1. The Tailor's Son Amelia's scream brought Gabriel running across the shop. Which was no small fea"},{"Movie":"Boxtrolls","Title":"Werewolves in Cheesebridge","Author":"OriginalSharkBiteGal","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11573780","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Winifred Portley-Rind paced in front of the first row of seats in the newly built Cheesebridge theater, one hand behind her back clutching a rolled up script and the other hand pinching the bridge of her nose in frustration. Her father had just used the latest fundraising money to build a proper theater for her and all the other thespians and musicians in Cheesebridge to perform in, rather than that little wooden stage in the market place that was becoming more unsteady by the day. Winnie was going to be the first person to open a show in the new building, one she wrote herself about an man who was hired to kill people but eventually ended up being hired to kill the love of his life's family, including her. A psychological thriller, much to Winnie's delight. Her cast was small, only a few people were needed. She had cast Molly as the leading lady, Elizabeth Jones, and Mr. Pickles as the lead role of Sir Bartholomew Angsteen. She casted them in particular because those two characters had a kissing scene, and she knew she wanted Molly for Elizabeth, but she did not want any other man but Mr. Pickles to kiss her, even though they weren't officially together they were still head over heels in love with each other. Unfortunately, Mr. Pickles was failing to meet the expectations of the role. Mr. Pickles stood on stage, fiddling with his scarf and waiting for the director to calm down. He looked over at Molly every few seconds, and she would give him a reassuring smile. Although she and everyone backstage knew exactly what Winnie was going to say. \"You stink of illiteracy! Murder! Betrayal! Don't you know anything about romance!?\" Winnie yelled, staring the tall man down. She then looked from Pickles to Molly and rolled her eyes, \"Of course you don't, why would I ask that?\" she mumbled to herself. Another moment of silence came before she finally spoke again. \"Mr. Pickles, do you realize that we open this show in a week, and you still say these lines as if you're reading a text book! Where's your passion? Where's your sorrow? You're about to kill the woman you love, don't you feel any regret? Remorse? Anything?!\" \"I- I feel… Sad.\" he piped up. Winnie threw her script onto the ground and balled her hands into fists, \"Then ACT like it!\" She heard a throat clear from the side of the stage and looked over to see Herbert Trubshaw poking his head out from behind the curtain. She groaned as she waited for the inevitable. \"Uh, Winnie- I mean, Ms. Director Ma'am. Perhaps what we need is another character to come in and-\" Winnie began, calmer than she had been with Mr. Pickles, \"For the last time, Herbert, there are no other characters for you to play. You are in charge of special effects.\" The man nodded his head quickly, leaving them Molly and Pickles alone on stage again,\"Righto, sorry. Carry on.\" Winnie took a few deep breaths to calm herself down. \"Alright, we're going to do this scene again. This time I want you to do it as if it were real, Mr. Pickles.\" She bent down to pick up her script and flip to the proper page. Mr. Pickles looked down at his feet, \"Oh, but I would never hurt Ms. Molly in real life.\" He peeked back up at Molly who giggled and turned away, trying to hid her blushing cheeks. Winnie wanted to gag, \"Well, in this reality you do. ACTION!\" Mr. Pickles walked off stage right to make his entrance. He took a deep breath and a gulp before stepping out and beginning. \"Elizabeth, dear? Are you here?\" He entered onto the stage that looked like a lady's bedroom. Molly at a vanity fussing with her hair. She turned quickly, surprised to see him, \"Bartholomew? What are you doing here?\" He stepped center stage, and shakily began his next line, \"I- I came to finish what I started.\" He stood tall, but you could tell he was nervous underneath all that height. Molly stood up and approached him, \"What do you mean?\" Mr. Pickles sighed and looked down. Molly stood up and approached him. He took her hands and looked her in the eyes. As sincere as he could, he spoke, \"Elizabeth, you know I love you with all my heart and soul. I would marry you if I could, but…\" \"But what? With my father gone we can finally have the life we wished, and we have the money to do it-\" Molly interrupted him, but was then cut off by Pickles. \"No. We can have the life that you wished.\" He let go of her hands and stepped away from her. Molly took a step towards him, attempting to put a hand on his shoulder, but he shook it off. \"Bartholomew?\" Mr. Pickles turned back towards her, pretending to take a knife out of his jacket and stepping towards her, \"I'm sorry, but a man has to do what a man has to do.\" As he approached her, she backed away, \"Bartholomew…\" She eventually backed into the vanity. Mr. Pickles went to strike with his invisible prop, but stopped midway through and turned out to the audience. \"Alright, how was that? I felt good that time, I felt there.\" he shook his arms out, a proud smile on his face. Molly stood beside him and beamed. It was better than he had done before. There was no response from the director for quite some time. Mr. Pickles held his breath as he waited. A moment later she finally gave feedback. \"Better.\" Pickles gave a sigh of relief. \"But it's still not my vision. Keep on practicing and maybe you'll get a third of the way there.\" She stood up from her seat and began gathering all her notes and papers together, \"That's a wrap for today, see you all again on Monday. Where's the stage manager?\" As she asked the question, Fish popped his head out from behind the curtain backstage, ran around it, and jumped down to the audience where she was. Everyone backstage bustled about to get ready to head home. Another long week of rehearsals was finally over, and the cast and crew had the whole weekend to recuperate before hell week began on Monday. Hell week is the week before a show opens when the actors and crew have to run the play cue-to-cue with lights, costumes, hair, makeup, set changes, effects, and everything in between to find out what needs to be changed, fixed, and polished before the show opens. Mr. Pickles felt fine about it all really, he had his lines memorized, his costume fit perfectly, he didn't have to worry about doing his hair since he had none. His only fear was that he would slip up on the acting itself. It was a stretch for him to play a character like Sir Bartholomew Angsteen. He was a ruthless killer while Monty Pickles would never hurt a fly. Especially a fly who was Ms. Molly Monte Cristo. Winnie was asking for some pretty brutal stuff in this play. He had to grab Molly by the arms, stab her, kiss her, and hold her by the waist. He could barely do any of that in real life, what made Winnie think he could do it on a stage? As he thought about all the week's work he had done, he saw that Molly stopped by with some of the backstage crew before leaving. Trubshaw, Hamilton, and Ms. Bonaparte, the town seamstress who was doing costuming for the play. Molly chatted with them about the rehearsal, \"I think it went pretty smooth. Not nearly as bad as the time Mr. Pickles dropped me on stage anyway.\" she rubbed her arm a moment, \"I'm still a bit sore from that…\" she commented. Mr. Pickles stood where they couldn't see him, but where he could still listen. Hamilton scrapped a spoon inside a jar of almost empty peanut butter. \"Well I don't think Pickle-Boy is getting any better. We've been doing this play for a month now and he still does his lines like he just read the script for the first time.\" He took the spoonful he could scrape out and shoved it into his mouth. Molly pouted, not sure how to argue. He wasn't wrong necessarily. \"He's trying.\" she retorted weakly. Hamilton popped the spoon out of his mouth and spoke while still chewing, \"And he can try all he wants, but what he lacks is the raw, natural, talent.\" He stood as tall as he could, but was still the shortest one in the group. Mrs. Bonaparte chuckled as she shadily commented, \"Ah, like the talent you have when you come out on stage with a spoon of Peanut Butter in your mouth?\" Trubshaw and Molly couldn't help but crack smiles and giggle. Hamilton side-eyed her, and shoved the spoon back into the jar to scavenge for more PB. He mumbled to himself as the rest mocked him, \"Exactly. I can act better than him with a mouthful of peanut butter.\" Mr. Pickles stepped out from his spot and cleared his throat. They all turned to him, unsure how much he had heard. Hamilton spoke up first, \"Great work today, Pickle-Boy.\" Mr. Pickles' face couldn't help but fall a bit, knowing he was lying straight to his face. \"Yes, well done. You are improving.\" Mrs. B patted him on the back as she walked past him, ready to head home. Hamilton and Trubshaw did the same, leaving just Molly and Pickles backstage. The two looked at each other for a moment. Molly sighed, \"How much did you hear?\" He rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed he had been listening at all. \"I- I'm pretty sure all of it.\" \"I'm so sorry, Monty.\" she walked up and hugged him. He was surprised, but hugged her back. He needed it. They began to walk out the backdoor, out into the alley, then out to the street. \"You really are getting better, you know? I mean it, I actually felt scared today.\" she giggled nervously, hoping she was cheering the poor man up. He sighed, \"You don't have to lie to me, Ms. Molly. Hamilton was just being honest. I'm not as great an actor as my resume says. I don't know why Winifred even casted me as this part in the first place.\" He watched his shoes as he walked down the cobble street. Molly put her hand on his arm sympathetically, \"Because she saw your potential. She knows you can do it.\" He looked at her, and she smiled at him hopefully. \"You sure about that?\" he asked, uncertain. She nodded, \"I am.\" She felt a lightbulb flash above her head as an idea popped into her mind, \"How about you come over to my house tomorrow afternoon and we can run some lines together. Maybe in a more private and less stressful setting so you can get into character better.\" she looped her arm into his as they walked, hoping to be helpful and also a bit flirty at the same time. Flustered by her offer and the touching he graciously accepted, \"Th- That would be l-lo-lovely.\" he managed to speak with a goofy grin across his face. They approached the front door of Molly's house and bid their goodbyes. Mr. Pickles walked down the street back to the factory as the sun set on the horizon. Rehearsal may not have gone too well, but he knew tomorrow would be a better day.[Chapter 2] Mr. Pickles accompanied Mr. Trout, and Ms. Pepper as they walked through the busy market place of Cheesebridge picking up a few groceries for each of their households. He felt nervous about the play and rehearsing with Ms. Molly later that day. He wasn't sure if it was a date, two friends hanging out, or a colleague helping another colleague. Mr. Trout and Pepper rolled their eyes as he rambled about the whole thing and assured him again and again that he would do fine in the play and with Molly. \"I just don't know…\" Mr. Pickles sighed, \"I wish I knew how to be more smooth.\" Mr. Trout wrinkled his brow, not sure if he heard his friend correctly. \"You wish you knew how to move?\" he repeated wrong. \" Smoooooottthhhh .\" Mr. Pickles said again, elongating the word. His friend nodded in understanding, \"Oh, you were talking into my bad ear. But maybe if you did articulate better you would be a better actor.\" At that Pepper cracked up laughing, hunching over and holding her gut. After a moment when she recomposed herself and wiped a tear from her eye, Mr. Trout spoke up, \"That- That wasn't a joke.\" She suddenly turned red from embarrassment and began smoothing out her dress and fixing her hair. She stood up straight but still hunched her shoulders a bit in humiliation. She cleared her throat, \"Sorry…\" Mr. Pickles watched as Ms. Pepper recomposed herself awkwardly and gave a long yawn. He then noticed how tired she looked. \"You doing alright, Ms. Pepper? You don't look too good.\" Ms. Pepper threw her hands up as if she was waiting to be asked that question all day. \"Don't get me started! I haven't gotten a wink of sleep in days . Have you heard that dog howling in the middle of the night lately? It's incredibly obnoxious.\" She leaned into the group to whisper, the two tall men bending down to hear her, \"I think it belongs to that Thane man, you know the Irish fellow who's so oddly normal…\" As she described him he happened to walk by. \"Top of the morning' to ya!\" he greeted in his thick accent as he tipped his hat revealing his curly red hair. Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles waved kindly back to him before he walked out of view. \"I hate him.\" Pepper stated shortly. She turned on her heels and continued to the Produce Caboose, the two men following behind her. As they walked past different stands something caught Mr. Pickles' eye. At a jewelry stand where different pendants, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings sat neatly in rows there sat a pendant on a gold chain. The beautiful piece had swirling gold paisley designs wrapping around a sparkling pink stone glittering in the center. As he looked at it he could envision it on no one else but Ms. Molly. It reminded him of her, he could practically see her reflection in the shining opal. She had to have it, and he had to be the one to get it for her. A sales woman approached him from behind the counter. \"Need any help my good man?\" she asked as she polished a large gem in her hand with a spotted rag. She had on a large pair of glasses and a headband with different magnifying lenses on her head. Her hair was brown and greasy, hangingng flatly at her shoulders. He pointed to the gold and pink pendant. \"How much for this?\" he asked. The lady gave it a look and rubbed the spotted rag on her chin as she thought about it. \"It's about ten shillings, but for you i'll make it eight, how's that sound?\" she smiled as if she struck up a good deal. Mr. Pickles frowned as he searched his pockets. He pulled out what he could scrounge up. \"Um… How about six shillings, this toothpick- that hasn't been used- and the key to the factory. Oh wait, I need that… Just the shillings and the toothpick then.\" he placed the key back in his pocket and the ladies' eyes followed as he did so. She caught sight of a chain coming out of his coat. \"What's that?\" she pointed to it. Mr. Pickles looked back at the lady who was staring at his left coat pocket. He hesitated, knowing what was happening, but pulled it out nonetheless. \"This? I-It's a family heirloom.\" He held his prized pocket watch in his hands for the woman to see. She was entranced with it, she took it from his hands, much to his dismay and observed it close up. \"Absolutely beautiful!\" she thought aloud. She traced her fingers along the antique design on the lid as she examined the watch. She even adjusted one of her magnifying glasses on her headband down in front of her eyes to get a better look at it. A slimy smile grew on her face. The lady reminded Mr. Pickles of some kind of crocodile. \"How about I give you the pendant for this. No shillings necessary.\" she offered. Mr. Pickles retorted immediately, \"This- This pocket watch has been passed down from generation to generation in my family, one Pickle to the next. Someday I hope to give it to one of my own children. If I have any, that is. That necklace might be the difference in me having those children though, so I- I think I would rather pay the shillings.\" he couldn't help but reach for his watch as he explained. He grabbed a hold of it whilst still in her grasp and for a moment they had a bit of a war to take it. After a fierce, loyal, tug he got it back into his hands and his pocket where it belonged. The woman crossed her arms. \"Pocket watch or nothing. That's my final offer.\" she stared him dead in the eyes. He bit his lip at he weighed his options. He stared at the necklace and held his watch in his pocket tightly. The pocket watch was his most prized possession, he took it with him everywhere and carried it with pride. It was the only really nice, expensive thing he owned. On the other hand, Ms. Molly meant the world to him more than any old pocket watch. He never usually bought her gifts, and this necklace was a ripe opportunity he was sure to never find again. He sighed and gave in, \"Alright. Here.\" he handed her back the watch with much remorse. The lady snatched it out of his grasp and held it close to her, going a small, maniacal laugh. She felt lucky to have her hands on such a vintage beauty. She looked down at the pendant on the table and tossed it to the man haphazardly. \"Here you are, sir, pleasure doing business with you!\" Mr. Pickles clumsily caught the jewelry and gave the woman a small huff before returning back to his friends. He gave another sigh of grief as he stared at the piece in his hands. The gold pieces glistened in the light of the sun, much like Molly's hair did. He couldn't help but smile. The exchange wasn't a complete loss. He placed the pendant in his pocket where his watch used to sit and rejoined his group. Later that day, Mr. Pickles joined Ms. Molly for a spot of tea and a small rehearsal at her house. They spent most of the afternoon into the evening running lines and reviewing blocking. Molly couldn't help but cringe at some of his performances. He tried to act scary but came off as sick. He tried to act suave but stuttered on his lines every time he made eye contact with her. The fact that he tried at all was miraculous though. Before she knew it his stuttering got less and less and what sounded like a sick throat became a natural speech pattern for Sir Bartholomew Angsteen. Molly was so proud of his improvement. She could tell that everyone, including Winnie, would think so too. By the end of the night they had run through the whole play, and he felt ready as ever for Monday's rehearsal at the theater. \"I'm feeling really good about all this. Thank you Ms. Molly for being so patient with me. I know the others haven't been so nice.\" Molly walked with him over to the front door of her home. \"Oh it was no trouble at all. I'd do anything for you.\" she smiled and swayed as she gazed at him with her big green eyes. Mr. Pickles was immediately entranced. \"A- And I you.\" he agreed. The lady giggled, and couldn't help but pull out her fan from her chest as she began to blush. Mr. Pickles cleared his throat and shoved his hand into his pocket awkwardly. He felt the pendant and gasped, suddenly remembering what he got for her. \"Speaking of which, I got you a little something. A gift for helping me out.\" he pulled out the necklace and held it in the palms of his hands for her to see. Molly gasped as he revealed the jewelry. He had never gotten her a gift before, especially one so expensive looking. Not that things like that really mattered to her. He could have gotten her a measly piece of cheese and she would have been grateful. \"Oh, Monty… It's so lovely.\" The man nodded, \"Yes, I- I saw it and I thought of you.\" Molly's eyes shot up towards his, both of them filled with stars. \"Really?\" she asked. She sighed dreamily as she took it from hi hands, handling it as carefully as she could. She stared at it, trying to see what he saw when he looked into that opal gem. She began slowly swaying again and smiled up at him in a flirtatious manner. \"Will you help me put it on?\" she asked, taking the position. Mr. Pickles cleared his throat and nervously answered, \"Oh, uh.. Hehehe, yes. Yes, of course!\" He took the chain in his hands and draped it around Molly's neck. He tried his best to keep his hands from shaking as he clasped it together. Molly turned and lifted her hair over the chain, an action Mr. Pickles had never seen her do before. She looked graceful. The lady couldn't stop smiling as she gave another dreamy sigh, \"It's absolutely beautiful. Thank you.\" She reached out her arms for a hug, and Mr. Pickles stepped in eagerly, burying himself in her big, gold hairdo. She smelled like the fruity teas she loved to drink; Almost a cranberry or apple mix. \"No, thank you.\" he mumbled as they hugged. They released, both grinning like idiots. Love-Stricken idiots, too afraid to confess their feelings to one another. \"I better get going then. Tootle-Loo, Ms. Molly.\" Mr. Pickles said as he opened the front door and took a step out. \"Tootle-Loo, Mr. Pickles.\" she waved back to him. He waited to turn until the door was fully closed. He took the few steps down from her front door to the streets of Cheesebridge and began his long walk home. He thought about all that happened today. Losing his pocket watch was a sad parting, but the look on Ms. Molly's face and the exchange they shared was worth more than a million pocket watches. He could still feel his heart racing, and the smell of her still lingered in his nose. He gave a dreamy sigh, much like she did earlier. The afternoon spent with Ms. Molly made him feel a new kind of confidence, one he hadn't felt in a very long time or possibly ever. As he walked tall and proud, something watched him through the light fog of the town. It followed him as he walked farther and father down Curd's way. The fog only got thicker the further down he went. There was an eerie feeling in the air, not like usual when he walked back to the factory. Mr. Pickles stopped in his tracks as he could swear he wasn't alone. As he looked around the streets were empty, only the blanket of fog rolled on the ground. He shrugged it off and continued walking, that newfangled confidence suddenly wavering on him. A low, growling sound echoed around him as he began to walk faster down the hill. Suddenly a loud howl was heard that made him freeze in his tracks. It sounded closer to him than he'd had preferred it to be. From the fog, a large dog jumped out at him. He screamed and moved out of the way, but as he did… CHOMP. The dog got a good bite right on his left hand. As soon as it was there, it was gone. Monty was startled, to say the least. He watched as the dog ran away into the shadows. Not giving it a second thought, he held his left hand in his right, and bolted it towards the factory.[Chapter 3] Mr. Pickles threw open the factory door and quickly shut it behind him as he tried to catch his breath. He still held his left hand in his right as it bled and stained the wrist of his coat. Mr. Trout and Mr. Gristle looked up from their sitting place at the wooden table as they heard the door slam. The moment Mr. Trout saw the blood he bolted up out of his seat and ran towards his buddy. \"Mr. Pickles are you alright? What happened?\" He snapped his fingers towards Mr. Gristle, \"Get something to wrap him in, quickly!\" Mr. Gristle nodded as he ran over to a small metal box filled with some dusty first-aid equipment. Meanwhile Mr. Trout continued to help out his tall friend, \"Come along, Mr. Pickles, let's wash you up.\" He led him over to a small sink by their stove where he turned on the worn out faucet. They had to wait a moment as brown mucky water came out first, then followed by cool, clear, water. The large fellow helped his friend wash the blood from his wound. Mr. Pickles couldn't help but wince at the pain. Mr. Gristle tugged at Mr. Trout's coat as he held out the bandages. The large man quickly snatched them out of his hands and tightly wrapped up Mr. Pickles hand. Mr. Pickles just blinked as his friend wrapped up his wound. He was grateful, but it all happened so fast. \"Um… Thank you.\" He couldn't think of much else to say. He looked at his hand impressed with the timing they made. Mr. Trout was a bit out of breath, \"Sorry, I just- I- I was worried.\" He was a bit embarrassed at how fast he reacted, but he wouldn't have done it any differently if he had to do it again. Mr. Pickles waved it off with his now bandaged hand, \"No, it's alright. Couldn't ask for better friends to help me out.\" he patted Mr. Trout's back and took a seat at the table. His two colleagues sat with him. \"How did that happen exactly?\" Mr. Trout asked him as he fiddled with his hands. Looking at the bandages alone made him a bit squeamish. \"Well, I was walking home from Ms. Molly's house. I gave her the necklace, by the way. She loved it.\" he smiled as he remembered it all, \"She even hugged me, and I could smell her hair. She smells like-\" Mr. Gristle interrupted him with a gagging sound, and Mr. Trout rolled his eyes, \"Mr. Pickles, please.\" he pleaded. \"Anyway, I was walking home from Ms. Molly's house when this dog came out of nowhere and gave me a good bite on the hand. Well, it wasn't good, it was painful. I- I just mean that it sure was a big one. I think it was one of those German Shepherds or Pomeranians, you know? The ones with all the fur.\" Mr. Pickles couldn't remember exactly what the dog looked like. It was so dark and foggy, all he could remember was the pounce, the bite, and the running. \"Uh-huh, sure…\" Mr. Trout ignored his obviously false estimate of the dog breed. That didn't matter so much. \"Then you just ran home?\" Mr. Pickles nodded, \"Just ran home. Quite a workout too. Almost toppled down the road a few times. It feels a lot steeper when you're running.\" he rambled. His friends were slowly starting to drift off as he continued rambling. Suddenly he could feel his head start to spin. He raised his good hand up to his head, \"I- I don't know if it was the running or the blood loss, b- but I feel very sick all a sudden…\" he closed his eyes, feeling a headache coming on. Mr. Trout immediately stood up and took his friends arm to help him up, \"Perhaps you should just be off to bed then.\" He helped Mr. Pickles down to the bedroom and let him rest. The following day, Mr. Pickles couldn't get out of bed at all. He was sick to his stomach and his head was still spinning. He was afraid he had rabies from the dog bite. Mr. Trout called the doctor over that afternoon, but he didn't have much to say. The bite was not infected and there were no traces of rabies, only a slight fever. The doctor suspected perhaps a bit of food poisoning and suggested he just ride it out till he got better. Mr. Trout worried for his friend and was by his side all day. He even made some of his special soup, but Mr. Pickles wouldn't eat, and when did he just threw it all up. On Monday though, Mr. Pickles hopped right out of bed all bright-eyed and bushy tailed as if the whole thing never happened. He marched right upstairs for breakfast. Mr. Trout did a double-take seeing his friend up so suddenly, but that wasn't the only reason he looked twice. \"M-Mr. Pickles! You're up! And you have a- a- a-\" \"A MUSTACHE! I know!\" he twirled it victoriously. It was a dark brown, and curled at the ends much like the fake one he used to wear in his shows with Madame Frou Frou. \"I mean I stopped shaving about… I don't know, fifteen years ago. I think it's finally starting to come in!\" He proudly sat at the table, propping his feet up on top of it, an arrogant action that reminded Mr. Trout of their old boss Mr. Snatcher. He watched in disbelief as his friend continuously twirled his new facial hair. This was all too peculiar. One moment he was sick as a dog, the next he's up looking better than ever. \"Are- Are you feeling alright?\" he asked. Mr. Pickles hopped out of his seat, startling his friend. \"Never felt better, Theodore! Never felt better!\" Just as quick as he stood up he sat back down. \"So what's for breakfast?\" Mr. Pickles picked up his fork and knife in each hand, awaiting his meal. Mr. Trout didn't know what to do, he was sure he was dreaming. Perhaps if he just played along he'd wake up and it would all go back to normal. \"Uh, eggs.\" he answered, lifting the warm pan off the stove. \"Perfect! Thank you!\" Mr. Pickles beamed. Mr. Trout took the small pan and scraped a third of the eggs onto his plate. \"Any bacon today?\" Mr. Pickles inquired. \"I can make some.\" Mr. Trout pulled out a brown paper package and unwrapped it. Inside were different meats he bought at the market the previous day. He sorted through for the bacon. \"How many you want?\" \"How many we got?\" Mr. Trout placed three slices on the pan. \"I jus got some more the other day, so a dozen.\" Mr. Pickles nodded. \"Ah, I see. So I would like…\" he counted on his fingers, \"A dozen.\" Mr. Trout stopped in his tracks, and turned to his friend. \"Uh, you sure?\" Mr. Pickles face fell and he looked at his friend in disbelief, \"Did I stutter?\" he snapped. \"No, no! A- A dozen it is then…\" he turned back to the pan and continued cooking. Mr. Pickles never snapped at him like that before. It was rather frightening, and he couldn't help but do what he was told because he wasn't sure what else to do. He cooked the bacon and much to his surprise Mr. Pickles ate all of it, as well as his own helping of eggs. Mr. Gristle woke up a while later and was disgruntled to find there was barely any food left for him,now that hit his eggs with Mr. Trout. \"I got to go start my walk up to the theater, thank you for the food Mr. Trout.\" As he stood up he saw Mr. Gristle giving him a death glare. He barely noticed though, \"Good day, Chester!\" he greeted. Mr. Gristle growled and attempted to bite Pickles' unbandaged hand, but Mr. Trout held him back. Monty never even noticed as he walked right out of the factory. He arrived at the theater after a brisk walk up the hill. He had so much energy in him, he had never felt better in his life. He almost forgot the awful pain from being in bed all day before. He was ready to go on that stage and show them all what a great actor he really was. As he entered through the backstage door, he could see everyone hustling and bustling putting everything together for their first dress rehearsal. Molly was in her costume pacing back and forth when suddenly she caught sight of him. She ran straight towards him, \"Oh, Monty! Are you alright? I heard you were sick and it made me worried sick and-\" she froze, noticing his new mustache. Mr. Pickles ignored her pause and took her hands in his, \"There is nothing to worry about, dear. I feel fit as a fiddle! I'm ready to go out there and be the Bartholomew Winnie wants to see!\" He gave her a pat on the shoulder as he stepped past her to go get ready for the run through. As he walked past her, her eyes followed him. He seemed so confident, so bold. Not a single stutter in his words or a waver of his hand. She gave a small smile, happy to see him so sure of himself. She was proud of him, yet something was off. She decided to ignore it for now. It was time for the run through and everyone was in their places. Winnie came backstage to check with everyone and paused when she saw her leading man. \"Is that fake?\" she pointed to his facial hair. He turned to her, trying to figure out what she meant. He crossed his eyes to see his mustache and spoke up, \"Oh no, it's mine. Grew it myself.\" Winnie narrowed her eyes as she stared at it. She gave a small nod, \"I like it.\" She clapped her hands and made her way to the audience, \"On with the show!\" Mr. Pickles took that as a good luck charm before stepping out on stage. The dress rehearsal went smoothly as the play began, but as it went on they got closer and closer to a scene that Pickles, and everyone watching, usually dreaded. It was the scene where Bartholomew got angry at Elizabeth and ended up kissing her. By the director's orders they weren't allowed to kiss until the opening night of the play, but they had to make it feel real and believable, so that anyone watching would have wanted them to kiss in that moment. This had been proven to be very difficult for Mr. Pickles in the past, considering he never liked to lay a hand on Molly without her consent or talk rudely to her in any way. He had to snap at her, grab her by the arm, and grab her by the waist. Usually he would feel sick before going through this scene, but this time he felt ready. \"You think you're so clever?\" he remarked to her. She gave a sharp turn to face him, placing her hands on her hips and a smirk on her face. \"I do what I have to do.\" she retorted. He approached her quickly and they were practically nose to nose. \"Tell me where they are?\" he asked forcefully. She narrowed her eyes, still looking cheeky, \"No.\" She turned on her heels again, her hair whacking his face purposefully as she walked away. Before she was out of his reach though, he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her back to him. She gave a shriek in surprise. Mr. Pickles had never actually done the proper action before, especially with such gusto. She had to admit though as good as it appeared to the audience perhaps it was a bit too real. His grip was rather tight on her. \"Listen here.\" he spoke quietly and calmly, but it was eerie and gave everyone watching chills, \"I will find out. If not from you, from the others.\" Molly laughed in his face and pulled her arm off his grip, with more force than she intended to use. \"If you wanted the others to tell you, you would have went to them first. I know why you came to me for the answers. You like talking to me. You're madly in love with me.\" Now Mr. Pickles gave a chuckle, \"Sure, i'll let you believe that.\" He crossed his arms and faced away from her. Molly clicked her tongue. \"Denial. Figures the most adored man in town is too much of a coward to face his feelings.\" She faced away from him as well. At this, Mr. Pickles whipped around and stomped straight towards her. He grabbed her by the waist and spun her around, holding her close. Molly gave another small shriek, never being handled this way before, \"I'll show you who's a coward!\" he stated sternly. That was when the kiss would take place, but instead, he simply booped his nose onto hers. She however closed her eyes and puckered up. There was a slight pause as Mr. Pickles waited for her to break out of character. \"Ms. Molly…\" he asked, out of character himself. Molly's eyes fluttered open as she broke character and relaxed her lips. He still held her tight and close. She was closer to him than she had ever been before. She was turned on, to say the least, and she wished he had kissed her right then and there. Winnie bursted out of her seat and applauded loudly. \"Bravo! Brava!\" Fish stood up beside her and patted his box as well. Everyone backstage gave whoops and hollers for the two actors. \"Oh, Mr. Pickles,\" Winnie began, \"What remarkable improvement! You have finally become my vision! You are Bartholomew Angsteen!\" He finally let go of Molly, and stepped forward. \"Thank you! Thank you so much!\" he looked back at his leading lady who was recomposing herself. As she caught him smiling, she smiled back and gave him two thumbs up. Everything seemed to really be looking up for Monty Pickles.[Chapter 4] Whilst Mr. Pickles had a wonderful day, feeling more confident than ever before, Mr. Trout couldn't help but notice a change in his friends attitude. Maybe it was his new mustache or his suddenly excellent acting, but he had become cocky and rude. He would snap at his friends, which he never did before. He wouldn't stutter in his words or hunch over while he walked. He was a new man, but it didn't seem like it was for the better. That night, everyone was asleep downstairs in the basement. Mr. Gristle snuggled his chewed up bat like a teddy bear as he snored in his hammock made out of old Boxtroll-catching nets. Mr. Trout was cozy on the top bunk that sunk under his weight, and Mr. Pickles was sleeping on the bottom bunk underneath with his feet hanging off the edge of the bed. It seemed peaceful, but Mr. Pickles couldn't stop tossing and turning in his sleep. He was feeling sick again, but this time it was worse. It felt like his whole body was undergoing a transformation. A sensation ran through his bones, sending chills up his spine, arms, and legs. Suddenly something came over him. Dog-like instincts kicked in and he was up out of bed on all fours. He sniffed around the room and caught the scent of his good friend, Mr. Trout. He barked up at the top bunk where he lay sleeping. Another bark, but no answer. He backed up and readied to pounce, wagging his tail behind him. He leaped up onto the top bunk, directly on his friends stomach, rudely awaking him. Mr. Trout coughed and tried to catch his breath. He then noticed the large, skinny, dog sitting on his belly patiently waiting for something. He was frozen in shock, unsure what to do. The dog began licking his face, much to his discomfort. He pushed the dog off of his belly and onto the floor. The dog gave a yelp of surprise as it hit the ground. Mr. Gristle awoke at this sound and in trying to get up to quickly, he fell out of his hammock bed onto the floor. He groaned as he rubbed his face and sat up. Mr. Pickles approached him and gave a few sniffs. As the dog sniffed him, Mr. Gristle growled and the dog whined and backed away in fear. Mr. Trout climbed the ladder down to the floor from his bunk and stood beside his short friend. \"Are you seeing what i'm seeing to, Mr. Gristle?\" He rubbed his eyes, making sure that this wasn't all some bizarre dream. \"You mean the dog that looks and sounds exactly like Mr. Pickles?\" Mr. Gristle grabbed his glasses off the night stand between the hammock and the bunk beds and placed them on his face. Mr. Trout gulped. \"Y- Yes…\" Mr. Gristle chuckled as he grew an eerie, toothy, grin on his face, \"Yes.\" They both sat for a moment and watched the dog scratch itself behind the ear with its foot. It looked just like their colleague Mr. Pickles, it wore his clothes and everything, the only difference was it was covered in shaggy brown fur. Even his barks and growls sounded like Mr. Pickles doing some sort of terrible animal impressions. The two men looked at each other. The same thought was crossing their minds, but how could they be sure it was the truth. Mr. Trout pushed his friend towards the dog, \"M- Make sure it's him.\" Mr. Gristle rolled his eyes, already knowing the answer, but went along anyway. He approached the dog and smelled him, as if he were an animal now too. As he did so, Mr. Pickles gave him a quick lick on the face. \"Bleh!\" Mr. Gristle exclaimed, backing away and wiping his face with his sleeve. \"It's him!\" The Mr. Pickles dog proceeded to take his pillow from off his bed and chew at it. Mr. Trout reacted quickly, \"No! Bad Mr. Pickles!\" he snatched the pillow away, but the dog had a tight hold. There was a bit of a tug-o-war as they fought for it. Ultimately, the dog won, sending Mr. Trout toppling backwards onto he floor. Mr. Pickles now saw this as a game and wagged his tail playful, jumping around and hoping they would do it again. Mr. Gristle looked down at his friend lying on his back on the floor. Mr. trout looked up at him, \"I think we're going to need some help.\" The two men nodded in agreement, and Mr. Trout sat up, \"You watch the dog.\" Mr. Gristle gave him a small salute before he rushed upstairs to the phone. At the Monte Cristo residence, the phone rang in the kitchen downstairs. Pepper groggily made her way out of her bedroom and down the stairs. She yawned as she answered, \"Monte Cristo residence, what do you want?\" Bitterness dripped from her voice, as usual. \"Ms- Ms. Pepper? Is that you?\" Mr. Trout asked hopefully. Ms. Pepper instantly perked up, as if she was wide awake. \"Mr. Trout, what a surprise! What are you doing calling here so late?\" she found herself fixing her hair like a schoolgirl taking to her crush, even though he couldn't see her. Mr. Trout thought for a moment, trying to figure out the best way to explain the situation. \"Well… Something has come up and I can't really explain everything right now, but I need you here at the factory right now. Could you do that?\" he begged. He looked behind him, where Mr. Gristle and Mr. Pickles had followed him upstairs. He rolled his eyes, as they played tug-o-war with a piece of rope they found on the floor. Mr. Gristle held his end of the rope in his mouth like the dog did. Pepper was confused but curious and promised to come, \"Alright. I'll be there as soon as I can!\" She hung up the phone and for a moment her heart beated loudly, unsure of what was to come. Her head filled with visions much like her books had told, of men setting up mystery dates and confessing their love. She had never felt like this about anyone before. She quickly yet quietly ran upstairs to her room and got dressed, making herself presentable. She felt silly fussing over herself like this so much for a man, but she really couldn't help it, she had no idea what was coming over her. She tiptoed down the stairs and out of the house. Once she was outside, she began racing down the hill as fast as she could without tripping and rolling down the road like a barrel. As she approached the Red Hat factory she had to stop, catch her breath, adjust her hair, and smooth her dress out one last time. Just as she was about to knock on the door, she heard a howling coming from inside. She froze, a bitter expression crossing her face. Another loud one came out, and she couldn't help but cover her ears. She hated dogs and the sound of howling, especially with the one in town keeping her up at night lately. Her face fell and all the thoughts she had worked up in her head before were wiped clean out of view. She sighed, looking like her tired self again, and knocked hard on the door. The door slid open to reveal Mr. Gristle, he leaned up against the door frame and smiled. \"Hey, good lookin'.\" His slimy grin was enough to make her gag, but she refrained. She pushed past him and into the factory, but stopped in her tracks as she saw the oddest sight before her. Mr. Trout was trying to hold down a large, skinny, dog, whilst it tried to escape from his grip and howl loudly at the moon shining in from the windows. At the sight of the lady, Mr. Trout released his grip and the dog bolted for the metal stairs. As soon as he reached a window, he propped his front paws on the wall and howled. All three of them covered their ears as he continued on. Ms. Pepper was now fuming with anger. \"Do you care to explain to me what is going on?\" she placed her hands on her hips and stared daggers at the man sitting on the filthy floor. He began to stand up as he tried to explain, \"Hehe, funny story really. Uh… You see, Ms. Pepper-\" \"Mr. Pickles is a werewolf.\" Mr. Gristle stepped in beside Pepper, making her jump at his sudden intrusion. She scowled at him and returned her attention to Mr. Trout. \"That's impossible!\" \"No, no, it's true! Think about it, he was bit by that dog the other night, and since then he's been more confident, more rude, he even grew a mustache! Now there is suddenly a dog in the factory that sounds and looks exactly like him?\" Ms. Pepper couldn't believe the stories they were coming up with this late at night. \"It's coincidence!\" she crossed her arms. Mr. Trout argued, \"What kind of a coincidence is that?!\" \"Well if you're so sure that that dog is Mr. Pickles, then prove it!\" Ms. Pepper smirked, sure he couldn't do it. Mr. Trout thought for a moment, then whistled and called the dog down to him, \"Mr. Pickles! Come here, boy!\" The dog poked it's head over the railing then came rushing down the steps and to his friends' side. The dog caught sight of Pepper and growled at her. Ms. Pepper stood her ground, too tired to care. The dog barked at her, and she snapped, \"Shut it!\" Mr. Pickles quickly whined and hid behind Trout's legs. The lady sighed, \"Alright, fine. I believe you.\" She pinched the bridge of her nose with one hand, keeping her other arm crossed in front of her. \"So if you know this dog is Mr. Pickles, then why did you call me down here?\" She let her hand fall to her side as she waited for another explanation. She was feeling incredibly foolish after fussing to get there so quickly, and now finding herself more tired than ever, she was ready to take the long walk back home and forget all about this. Mr. Trout rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed he had dragged her all the way down there so late at night. \"Well, I wasn't sure how to handle this situation. We have to figure out how to change Mr. Pickles back to normal. I- I figured you could help since you're the smartest person I know.\" Ms. Pepper's face shifted from angry and tired to shocked and flattered. \"Really?\" she asked. He nodded, a small, warm, smile on his face. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to keep her cool and refrain from grinning like an idiot. She regained her composure and opened her eyes, \"Fine, I will help you with… This.\" she gestured to Mr. Pickles as he chewed on his own leg. \"Tomorrow we will go to the library and research the whole subject of werewolves, but for now I want to sleep.\" Mr. Trout nodded understandingly as he looked down at his friend who was trapped in this curse. He hoped there was a cure to change Mr. Pickles back into his normal self.[Chapter 5] The next day Mr. Trout met Ms. Pepper at the library to start their research and help find the answer to Mr. Pickles problem. They both looked dead tired. While Ms. Pepper had to walk uphill all the way back home, Mr. Trout was up most of the night trying to calm down a hyperactive dog. By the time they got him to settle down, he was only able to get a few hours of sleep before daybreak. \"Long night?\" he asked her as they scanned the shelves for books on dogs, wolves, werewolves, and anything else that might help them. Ms. Pepper rolled her eyes and yawned, \"You could have at least tried to halt some of Mr. Pickles howling last night.\" She picked out a red spine book off the shelf titled Monsters and You . \"Oh, that wasn't Mr. Pickles. That was some other dog, and every time it howled Mr. Pickles tried to howl back.\" Mr. Trout groaned remembering the whole thing. He and Mr. Gristle had to practically wrestle him to keep him quiet most of the night. The two gathered as many books as they could and stacked them high on a table in the middle of the library. It was quiet and empty, perfect for studying. They had to have read through every book at least twice, yet nothing useful came up. \"Have you found anything?\" Mr. Trout asked, setting down a book on dog anatomy. She shook her head. \"All i've discovered is the way to kill a werewolf, but not cure one.\" There was a pause as she thought about it for a moment, \"You know we could-\" \"No!\" he answered loudly, proceeding to get shushed by the librarian. \"Sorry.\" he whispered to the old woman. He turned back to Pepper and repeated quietly, \"No!\" She shrugged, it was worth a shot. Hours had passed and books had come and gone from the table, but nothing was helping them enough. They kept a small journal beside them, writing down any useful information. At one point, Ms. Pepper went to write something down about silver when she spotted some writing about dog care. She picked up the journal and read it to herself, \"Brush dog at least once a day? Feed water and kibble? Mr. Trout, what is this?!\" \"Oh, well, I figured I should know how to look after him if he is going to be a-\" before he could finish she gave him a good whack on the arm with the notebook. He rubbed the spot she hit and put aside the book he was reading on pets. \"Let's focus, shall we?\" she snapped, returning to her novel that had nothing to do with the subject of dogs or werewolves. Mr. Trout looked at the cover of her book and snatched it out of her hands. He stood up so his hands were out of her reach as she tried to snatch it back. He scoffed at her, and she crossed her arms and turned away from him, angry and slightly embarrassed. He returned the book to her and mocked, \"Let's focus, shall we?\" She snatched it back from him \"I was taking a quick break!\" He smirked at her, sitting back down and continuing the research. A whole six hours was spent in the library with one break to go get a bite to eat, but they couldn't find anything on how to cure a werewolf. They found plenty on how to kill, care for, feed, make, and avoid werewolves, but nothing on how to cure. \"This is hopeless.\" Ms. Pepper finally gave up, setting down How to Avoid the Supernatural for the fourth time. \"No we can't give up, Mr. Pickles is counting on us!\" Mr. Trout protested. He thought for another moment, realizing too that the books were of no help to them. \"Maybe there's someone in town we can talk to. Someone who knows about monsters and wolves and all this.\" Pepper stood up from the table, beginning to put away all the books they had retrieved. \"Really? I doubt anyone in Cheesebridge would be weird enough to know anything about the subject of werewolves. Boxtrolls? Yes. Cabbage Heads? Maybe. But not werewolves.\" Mr. Trout helped her clean up as he thought about the different people in Cheesebridge. Pepper had a good point, but there had to be at least one person in town who had even the slightest bit of knowledge. Someone who was creepy and isolated, perhaps. He remembered someone who Mr. Snatcher used to talk to, the mortician down on Curd's Way, not too far from the factory. \"Well there is someone we could try asking…\" Ms. Pepper was befuddled as she and Trout stood outside the front door of the Green Hat Morgue. She knew they were going to see some creepy people, but she had hoped they were at least living. Mr. Trout held open the door for the lady, and she stepped in slowly. Inside the lighting was dim and the wooden floors were in need of some sweeping. There was a dusty counter with a bell covered in cobwebs sitting on it, along with papers scattered about. Behind the counter there were shelves of books, notebooks, and jars filled with things that looked almost like organs and different body parts. To the right, behind the counter, there was a door with a sign on it reading \"APPOINTED PERSONNEL ONLY SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.\" \"You sure this place isn't abandoned?\" Pepper looked to Mr. Trout, who seemed just as creeped out as her, yet almost used to it all at the same time. He shook his head, \"No, it's actually quite lively when the boss is around here. She's an… Interesting one.\" he remembered the Cheesebridge mortician well. She and Snatcher were very close in fact. Mr. Trout hadn't seen her since he had passed away. \"Try ringing the bell.\" he suggested. Pepper hesitantly reached forward and dinged the bell, quickly retreating her hand and wiping off any webs onto her apron. As the bell dinged, there was a loud thud, and the counter shook as something hit it from underneath. The two were startled and couldn't help but shriek. \"No need to shout!\" A low, yet feminine voice shouted from under the counter. A woman emerged wearing a green hat with a monocle on it on top of her thick, brown, head of hair. She had a green vest over a white button up shirt with both sleeves rolled up, and pants, which only the daring woman in Cheesebridge seemed to sport. The most peculiar thing about this woman was not her job, her home, or her clothes, but her right arm, which really wasn't an arm at all. It was a mechanical prosthetic that seemed to perform all the basic functions of an arm with a steampunk flair. \"Dr. Payton at your service! You got a body? We'll dress, it bury it, revive it! Anything you need! Now, what can I do you two for?\" Pepper and Trout looked at each other unsure how to begin. Payton watched them exchange glances and began again, \"Say no more. I know the loss of a loved one is hard, but me and my crackerjack crew can deal with even the most rotting corpses!\" Pepper felt sick at the thought of dead bodies and rotting organs, and waved her arms in front of her, \"No, no, no. We don't have any dead bodies. We need your help with a live one.\" Payton's face contorted, she never had a case like this before. \"Sorry, Miss. I only deal with dead bodies.\" \"No, you don't understand, our predicament is rather… Unusual.\" Mr. Trout spoke up. Payton eyed the man for a moment, \"Do I know you from somewhere?\" she asked. \"Yes, yes, I'm Mr. Trout. One of Mr. Snatcher's colleagues in the Red Hat business.\" he reminded her. The mere mention of Snatcher caused Payton to go pale. She didn't like thinking about her old friend, it was much too painful. The day she lost him was a grim day at the morgue. Having to shovel up all his guts spewed inside of Portley-Rind's house was a nightmare she relived every night in her dreams. Now, seeing one of his lackeys again just made her feel sick to her stomach. The man noticed her sudden shift and tried to refocus her, \"Ms- Ms. Payton?\" She slammed her fists on the counter, causing the two to jump. \"That's Doctor to you, sir!\" she shouted. Mr. Trout apologized profusely, \"Sorry! Sorry, Doctor Payton.\" Payton was breathing heavily as she took a moment to regain composure. She closed her eyes,, \"My apologies, it's just- It's been so long since…\" Her eyes shot open, she didn't have to explain herself. Nor did she have to talk to either of these people who were just wasting her time. \"If you two have come to chit-chat I am much too busy. I do not have to time to reminisce and have chummy banter.\" She began to gather papers off the desk as if she actually had work to do. Mr. Trout began to plead, \"No, please, we need your assistance! You see our friend-\" \"I told you, I only deal with dead people!\" The doctor stood her ground as she then turned and grabbed a jar of eyes off the shelf behind her. \"LOOK!\" Pepper now slammed her fists on the table, tired of watching this woman walk over her dear friend. \"We just have some questions to ask you, and then we'll be on our way and never come back into your humble abode ever again, got it?\" She spat sarcasm on 'humble abode.' Payton turned sharply, eyeing the tiny woman who had so much rage built up inside her. They stared at each other intensely for each other, and realized in that moment that they both had a lot of respect for one another. Payton gave in, but kept on a hard face, \"Fine. What do you need to know?\" She leaned forward on the counter, hoping this wouldn't take too long. Pepper nudged Mr. Trout to ask. He gulped, then began, \"Do you know anything about… Werewolves?\" Payton was surprised by the subject, but happy to jump in, \"Werewolves? HA! Of course I know about werewolves.\" She turned back to the shelves and searched for a book, \"Like most young girls, I went through a werewolf phase and learned everything there is to know about them.\" She found the one she was looking for and ripped it off the shelf and onto the counter. She blew the dust off of it and unintentionally towards the two guests. They coughed and waved the dust away. Mr. Trout didn't care much, he was so relieved to have possibly found an answer, \"Perfect! Because, you see, our friend sort of got bitten and now-\" \"Ah, so that's what all that howling has been then? Fascinating.\" Gears were turning in Payton's head as she recalled the lovely howling she would hear at night while she stayed up working. \"So I'm guessing you want to know how to kill'em then?\" She proceeded to open the book to a page where there was a graphic and gruesome illustration of a werewolf being shot by three silver bullets. At the sight of the image, Mr. Trout covered his eyes. \"NO! No, quite the contrary, we need to know how to cure him. Turn him back to normal.\" Payton shut the book with a loud thud, \"Well sorry to burst your bubble, but there is no 'cure.'\" She rested her left elbow on it and began tapping on the counter with her robotic fingers. \"Only way to help them is to kill'em with silver bullets.\" Mr. Trout sighed, perhaps this really was hopeless. Pepper placed a comforting hand on his arm, and they both looked down in grief. \"However!\" Payton began again, causing both their heads to perk up in unison. \"That all depends. Is your friend the original werewolf or was he bitten?\" Mr. Trout answered quickly, \"B- Bitten, just a few nights ago.\" \"Ah, alright. That changes everything.\" Payton reopened the book. Pepper linked arms with Mr. Trout and they smiled at each other, happy to be back on track. The doctor flipped open to a page with a portrait of a man. A caption underneath it read 'Doctor Chaney Jr. dedicated his life to the research of werewolves and other strange creatures of the supernatural.' The two anxiously waited as she read through the book, refreshing her memory. Payton continued, \"There is a way to cure your friend. You must kill the original werewolf that bit him in the first place, but you must do it before the next full moon. Let me guess, he's actin more like a dog than a blood thirsty monster, right?\" The two nodded. She rolled her eyes and shook her head, \"Typical. A werewolf don't become a real werewolf till his first full moon. Then the transformation is complete and there will be no helping him after that. Unless you want to kill'em, which it seems like you don't.\" Pepper took in all the information, \"So all we have to do is find whoever bit Mr. Pickles, off them, and he'll be good as new!\" She shook Mr. Trout's arm, who didn't seem to eager on the idea of killing someone. Payton laughed, \"Woah, Pickle Boy is the werewolf? That's gotta be a riot!\" She could just imagine that tall, gangly, man covered in fur on all fours. The idea cracked her up. Mr. Trout shook his head slowly, \"It's not…\" Pepper pointed to the book underneath the laughing woman, \"May we borrow that for a bit? Until we cure our friend at least?\" Payton picked it up, wiping a tear away from her eye after all her hysterics, \"Knock yourself out. Heaven knows you need it more than I do!\" Pepper took t eagerly and the two made their way out of the creepy shop. The hunt was on for the original werewolf.[Chapter 6] Pepper and Mr. Trout went back to the library to get a book on moons and star charting, then headed back to the factory to calculate when the next full moon would rise. They sat at the wooden table, books and notes sprawled around them. Mr. Trout's face fell as he configured the charts, \"Oh no…\" \"What is it?\" Pepper leaned over his shoulder to look at the notes, her feet dangling above the floor as she peeked at the papers. Mr. Trout was surprised by her sudden advance, but kept his head forward knowing that if he looked at her he'd blush for sure. Feeling her on him was enough to give him chills. He cleared his throat and focused, \"The next full moon is in three days, on Friday night!\" Pepper hopped off his shoulder and paced back and forth behind him, trying to clear her head and think. \"Then we've got three days to solve this mystery and save Mr. Pickles.\" She crossed her arms, tapping her chin with one hand. \"Well, we better get ready then.\" Mr. Trout set down his notes and looked at her with a puzzled expression, \"R- Ready for what?\" Pepper scrounged through the piles of junk they had lying about by the desk of useless papers. She found a small, leather, knapsack and placed it on the table. She looked at him like it was obvious, \"To go hunting!\" \"Hunting?!\" Pepper searched for anything useful they might need while out at night. She picked up a flashlight on the desk and tested it out. It was dim, but it would do. \"What? You used to hunt Boxtrolls just fine!\" she argued as she packed the flashlight into the bag. Mr. Trout remembered his days catching Boxtrolls. He was sure that those creatures were much more tame than any werewolf ought to be though. And the thought alone of taking someone's life made him sick. \"Yes, but this isn't a sweet little Boxtroll, Miss. It's a blood thirsty monster, and also a person. A person with a life, and possibly a family, and we'd be taking them away from all of that.\" he paused in his midst of paniced thinking and looked at the lady, who was barely paying attention to him as she packed the bag full of their notes. He sighed, realizing his efforts were futile, \"How are we going to go about finding this werewolf anyway? We don't even know how to catch a werewolf!\" \"That is where you are wrong my dear Mr. Trout.\" She picked up the werewolf book off the table and tapped it with her finger, \"Everything we need we got right here.\" She flipped through some pages searching for something useful, \"I read a bit of it while you were figuring out the full moon business. Any person in town could be a werewolf and we'd never know it. We have to go at night when they'll be in wolf form.\" Mr. Trout felt himself shaking at the mere thought of going out at night while there was a deadly monster about. \"B- But if we are out searching for the werewolf, who will watch Mr. Pickles?\" he argued, trying to get out of this in any way he could. Pepper waved her hand toward Mr. Gristle who was feeding his leeches, \"Ah, Mr. Gristle can do it. Who better to look after a dog than another dog?\" The man heard them talking about him and gave her a sleazy grin and a wink, \"Woof.\" he flirted. \"Ew.\" Pepper shuddered before returning back to the book. She looked up at Mr. Trout who was a nervous wreck fiddling with his hands, trying to comprehend the whole ridiculous situation. \"This- This is all happening so fast. I don't know if any of this is such a good idea.\" he peeked over to the book where it was open onto a page of the anatomy of a werewolf. \"Mr. Trout, we have to do this. For Mr. Pickles.\" She then placed a hand on his, \"I'll be right beside you the whole time. Trust me, this whole thing will be over before we know it.\" They exchanged warm smiles and the man suddenly felt a lot better about the whole thing, still very uncertain, but better knowing he had Ms. Pepper by his side. \"And don't you dare tell anyone i'm actually willing to help Mr. Pickles. My reputation will be ruined.\" Mr. Trout laughed at her small joke, but she did not crack so much as a smile, for she was being dead serious. As the sun set outside, Mr. Pickles burst into the factory, interrupting their tender moment. \"Good afternoon everyone! How we doing on dinner, Theodore?\" He stepped in proudly with his head held high as if he owned the joint. Pepper packed her book away quickly, hoping he wouldn't see it. \"No dinner from Mr. Trout tonight, Mr. Pickles. You'll have to figure out your own meal.\" Mr. Pickles noticed the lady present and slowly moved toward her, \"Well, well, well, what have we here?\" He leaned on the table, trying to be suave, \"You didn't have to come all the way down here to see me, Ms. Pepper. I was just uptown not moments ago.\" He twirled his mustache flirtatiously at Ms. Pepper. \"HA!\" she exclaimed, \"You think I want to see you and your disgusting facial hair? I'm here to see Mr. Trout. We got business to attend to.\" She turned away courtly and went back to her packing. Mr. Pickles mind started turning as he looked between the two, then at Mr. Trout specifically, \"Look at you, Mr. Trout! Didn't think you had it in ya!\" He draped an arm proudly around his pal. Mr. Trout quickly shook his hands in front of him, \"No, no, no! It's not like that at all!\" Mr. Pickles winked, \"Sure it isn't.\" He gave him a punch on the arm, and backed away from the table. \"I'll leave you two be then, don't want to disturb the lovebirds.\" He made his way down to the basement bedroom chuckling to himself. Pepper was disgusted by his whole presence, \"You weren't kidding when you said he was greasy…\" Mr. Trout simply shrugged; he was used to it already, but still very uncomfortable with the new Monty Pickles. He hoped this werewolf business would be over soon. The sun set and the moon rose out into the dark evening sky. It was chilly and foggy, but they could still see the streets below their feet. They started downtown, just a couple streets above the factory where they presumed Mr. Pickles was bitten. Pepper pulled out her book to the table of contents and turned to chapter four. She read aloud, \"A werewolf, despite the name, is not much like a wolf at all besides its similar physique. While wolves like to stay in packs, werewolves are very lone creatures. Anything they come across that is living they will surely rip to shreds, or at least attempt to.\" Mr. Trout gulped and started shaking, \"And you still think it's a smart idea to hunt for this thing?\" Pepper rolled her eyes for the hundredth time as she shut the book, placed it under her arm, and dug her hand into her knapsack hanging by her side. She pulled out a rusty revolver and spun out the cylinder to show him the bullet inside. \"We're safe with this weapon in our hands.\" she assured him, \"Unfortunately we've only got one silver bullet, so if we are going to fire we got to make it count.\" The man nodded understandingly, hoping he wouldn't have to be the one pulling the trigger when the time came. They followed the books instructions on where a werewolf might lurk in the dark hours of the night. There was practically no wildlife for the creature to hide in like the book suggested, so they had to figure out other places that fit the description of dark, ominous, and eerie. They searched alleys, garbage cans, underneath bridges, and even the piers by the river, but no clues came up whatsoever. Wandering around all night after having researched all day, they decided to head home and get some well deserved rest. They figured they would better prepare themselves tomorrow before heading out werewolf hunting the next night. Pepper yawned, \"I'll skim through the book some more tomorrow and see if there is anything else useful we can use.\" Mr. Trout nodded. There wasn't much else to say. After a silent moment, they nodded to each other and groggily parted ways back to their cozy beds for some well needed sleep. Whilst Pepper and Mr. Trout tried to fix Mr. Pickles problem behind the scenes, there were other things to worry about behind the scenes of Winnie's show. Molly couldn't help but notice how different Mr. Pickles was acting all of a sudden. At first his newfound confidence was delighting as well as sexy. Now it seemed to transform into more of an air of arrogance that floated over his head, wafting a smell that made everyone's heads spin. Monty Pickles was clearly not the same, and Molly wasn't the only one to notice in the cast. \"HAMILTON!\" Mr. Pickles shouted, pushing a small comb away from his face. \"How many times I gotta tell ya? I brush the mustache out not down!\" Everyone shadily listened in as Mr. Pickles had another fit backstage. This wasn't the first time either; all week he had been making a fuss over the simplest things. Whether with the director or the makeup crew, he was turning into a regular diva. Hamilton didn't take the attitude as easily as some of the other crew members did though, \"And how many times I gotta tell you that I am a professional! They didn't put me in charge of hair for no reason, Pickle-Boy! I know what i'm doing! Quite frankly, i've had my mustache longer than you.\" he fought back. Mr. Pickles stood up to his full height, towering over the short man. \"Yes, but the difference between your mustache and mine is blatantly obvious. I've had this thing for almost a week and it's turned more heads than any length of hair you've grown on your empty head.\" he picked up the end of Hamilton's beard and held it in his hands like it was a filthy rag. The barber snatched his hair out of the ungrateful actor's hands and looked like he was ready to let loose like some kind of canon. Fortunately, Trubshaw quickly came to his side to rescue him, \"Hamilton, be a dear and come help me with this over here won't you.\" as he took him by the shoulders and escorted him away he whispered into his ear, \"Don't worry about him. Molly's gonna have a talk with him and figure out this whole kerfuffle.\" Mr. Pickles fixed his coat as he watched the two turn the corner. He turned to make his way to the stage but almost bumped into Molly who stood right in his way. Rather than blubber out some awkward apology like usual, he simply took his hands, moved her aside, and said rather rudely, \"Excuse me.\" and kept walking. Molly was shocked and appalled by the action. He had never treated her in any manner like that before. His actions just kept getting worse and worse as rehearsals went on, she wasn't sure how much longer anyone could handle it.. She knew it was her responsibility, in a way, to confront him. After that rude gesture she almost wanted to just yell at him, but she never could. She simply took a deep breath and followed behind him. \"Mr. Pickles, can I talk to you for a moment?\" The man turned on his heel and smoothly leaned against the wall with his arm. \"Depends what ya got to talk about?\" he smiled. Molly usually would feel warm at a gesture like that, but his smile felt so cold and empty to her. She cleared her throat, \"You've been acting… Different, lately.\" Mr. Pickles smoothed out his coat and fixed his mustache. \"Oh, you've noticed?\" he twirled it triumphantly. \"Yes, unfortunately. I, and many of the others, think you should possibly tone it down a bit. I think all this stardom has gotten to your head.\" she explained. \"HA!\" he laughed, \"The only thing that's getting to anyone is the silly notions you and these other buffoons are concocting up in ya heads!\" He stood upright, and played with her hair as he blatantly insulted every one of his coworkers. Molly smacked his hand away and then balled her hands into fists by her side. \"We are not buffoons. We're your colleagues, and we expect you to treat us with respect.\" she crossed her arms demandingly. Mr. Pickles face fell. He leaned in close to Molly, much to her discomfort. Quietly, he spoke, \"I'll start delivering when you all start doing your jobs right.\" He could see the chills run through her as he spoke, even if she did try to keep a controlled demeanor. He smirked, stood back up to his full height and started counting people off on his fingers, \"Hamilton needs to learn to properly comb a mustache, Winnie needs to learn how to write a script, Fish needs to learn the difference between a bagel and a doughnut, and you need to learn how to say your lines without sounding so acty-schmacty.\" Molly's whole body twitched at the last remark. Now he was taking jabs at her personally and she did not stand for that. \"Excuse me? I sound acty-schmacty? Last I checked no one says 'I never even knew the man' the way you do on stage!\" she mocked his line. Her face was now scrunched up in anger, her hands on her hips, her eyes full of fury. He was now just as offended as she was. He turned away from her and fixed his scarf proudly, \"I learned to act from the best!\" \"You learned from me you nitwit!\" She stomped her foot as she shouted at him; something she never thought she'd have to do. Mr. Pickles face fell, thinking it over and realizing she was right. He scoffed it off quickly though. He looked back down at the lady and whispered close to her as he slid an arm around her shoulder, \"Do you want to kiss me as badly as I want to kiss you?\" he smiled flirtatiously under his unflattering facial hair. Molly pushed him off of her quickly. \"Get your hands off me you brute! I should hope to never lay eyes upon you or your stupid mustache ever again after this show ends.\" With that, she marched her way back to the dressing rooms leaving the former man of her dreams alone to roll his eyes and mutter to himself, \"Women.\"[Chapter 7] The next couple of days were spent prepping for the play's opening night. While this whole experience began as a way to bond Molly and Mr. Pickles together, it seemed like it would end with them being further apart than ever before. She wouldn't even speak to him unless they were on stage. Every time she saw him backstage he was attempting to flirt with women or being extremely rude to his cast mates. Molly couldn't understand the sudden change in heart he decided to have, but she couldn't do anything about it except deal with it until the show was over. The next couple of nights showed little success of their own. Pepper and Trout went out and followed as many tricks in the werewolf book as they could find, but everything just seemed to lead to dead ends. It was Thursday night before they knew it, and they worried they wouldn't find an answer in time to help Mr. Pickles. Mr. Trout sat on the curb on Milk Street, head in his hands, failure flooding over him. \"Thats it then. Mr. Pickles is going to be a werewolf forever, and there is nothing we can do to save him.\" Pepper flipped through the book rapidly for help, but even she had to admit it was pretty useless now. She had read through it inside and out; they tried every trick twice at least. There was nothing left to do. She shut the book with a loud thud and threw it across the street in anger. Mr. Trout peeked through his fingers as the book flew through the air and landed under the blanket of soft fog under the streetlight. \"You know that's not yours, right?\" he reminded her. Pepper sighed, \"I don't care…\" She paused a moment, then dug through her bag, \"You know what this means, right?\" Mr. Trout looked at her, waiting for an answer. She pulled out the gun and cocked it. \"We'll have to kill Mr. Pickles.\" Mr. Trout shot up from his seat. \"WHAT?! NO! We- We don't have to go to such extremes so quickly do we?\" he pleaded. \"There are no options left!\" Realizing the sudden risks, Mr. Trout paced as he tried to think of at least one other way, \"M- Maybe there is!\" His pacing quickened as he attempted to figure out an idea. Suddenly a howl rang through the air causing them both to stop in their tracks. Their eyes made contact and they quickly gathered their things to run towards the sound. They ran down Curds Way as they followed the noise. One moment it was coming from the right, the next it was coming from the left. They were practically tripping over themselves trying to catch up with the howls. Before they knew it, they ended up in front of a familiar house on Guernsey Lane. They both knew who's house it was, but were hesitant to react. Pepper decided to go for it. She took a deep breath and rang the unnecessarily complicated doorbell of the Trubshaw house. The youngest member of the household, Eggs, answered in his pajamas, although he looked wide awake. \"Oh! Hello Ms. Pepper, Mr. Trout! What can I do ya for?\" Eggs asked cheerfully. \"Well, uh… We think we heard some howling coming from this house. Is there perhaps a dog around? A big one? Perhaps with big teeth and a thirst for blood?\" Pepper asked, failing at trying to keep herself from looking inconspicuous. Eggs shook his head without hesitation, \"Nope! No dog was howling, I was.\" Pepper's whole body drooped as he explained. \"What?\" she spoke in a monotone. Eggs nodded rather proudly, \"Yup. I heard howling happening and I thought it sounded fun so I joined in. Father did too.\" he turned back to look up the stairs where Trubshaw and Fish waved down to their visitors. \"Ah, company! Come to join in the howling?\" Trubshaw asked. Pepper face palmed herself, annoyed with the disruption in their hunt. \"So you're not the werewolf?\" she asked, muffled behind her hand. The boy looked confused, but replied, \"I'm a boxtroll.\" Pepper waved her hands, \"Nevermind! Knock the howling off and go to bed! All of you! It's the middle of the night for goodness sakes!\" She reached in and closed the door for him. Mr. Trout waved to them all before the door shut, \"Nice to see you all! Have a good night.\" Pepper looked up at him with annoyance. He quickly dropped his smile and cleared his throat, \"Sorry. So what do we do now?\" As if their prayers were answered, they heard a distant howl from the other side of town. Pepper pointed down the street, \"Follow that howl!\" She picked up her skirt and bolted down the street, Mr. Trout not too far behind her. They darted from street to street down farther and farther until they ended up in Casein Court. It was the abandoned chunk of Cheesebridge that was run down, where no one lived and only the rats roamed. Before crossing the threshold of the street. They stopped and waited for another howl to assure they were in the right spot. Neither of them wanted to step foot in that court if they could help it. It was only children's jumprope game legends, but people who entered these buildings never came back out of them. Pepper usually scoffed at these silly notions, but even she had to admit that at night it was rather ominous and spooky. Nearly a minute passed and nothing had come up. They patiently waited, but it was dead silent. At least five minutes had passed and not a sound. They both sighed in unison. It was almost dawn and their time was fleeting. It seemed another howl was not coming, unfortunately. The two of them had never been out hunting till the sun rise like that before. They dragged their feet back down to the factory. Both of them were dead tired, especially Mr. Trout. He was ready to get some sleep, even if he slept in a little bit more than usual. Pepper on the other hand, was fighting back the urge to close her eyes. \"Come on Mr. Trout, I think now that it's daytime it would be a good idea to go back to Casein Court.\" The man was too tired to do any more work. Today was worse than ever with all the literal running around town. He yawned as he sat down at the table, \"Perhaps some sleep first?\" As he laid down his head on the wood, Pepper dropped the knapsack onto the table with a loud thud, jolting his head up. \"There's no time! The full moon is tonight! We have to do this now.\" He practically ignored her as he laid his head down once again. The lady groaned, \"Fine, i'll go by myself.\" she picked her bag back up off the table and swung it over her shoulder. Mr. Trout's head shot up at this. \"No! I cannot let you go alone to that creepy place, miss.\" he seemed alert, but his eyes were barely staying open. \"Then come with me.\" Pepper insisted. He sighed, he just was not feeling up to any more excitement; he needed to reenergize. \"Do we really have to? Can we not sleep for just an hour?\" he pleaded. Pepper sighed, looking at the desperate man before her. He really was tired, it was obvious. She gave a rare, soft smile. \"Fine. You sleep Mr. Trout. Get to bed, go to sleep.\" She helped him up from the table and led him to the top of the stairs that led down to the basement. Before going down, he gave her a stern look. \"You better not go by yourself.\" She shook her head, a smile still on her face. \"I won't. I promise.\" They made brief eye contact and he sighed before heading down the stairs to his bedroom. As Pepper made her way out of the factory, she muttered to herself, very pleased with the plan she was concocting in her head, \"I'll take Shoe with me!\"[Chapter 8] Pepper spent more time than she'd have liked to freshen up. Admittedly, she was tired too. She didn't intend to sleep, but ended up napping for a couple hours on accident. Realizing the time, she quickly got ready and went out to find her favorite Boxtroll pal Shoe. It was already late afternoon when they finally began to make their way to Casein Court. When they arrived at the threshold of the street, Shoe realized where they were and quickly hid inside their box. Pepper rolled her eyes and pulled out a small cookie from her apron pocket. \"Come on, Shoe. Look what I got for you!\" They poked out their head and upon seeing the cookie, reached out their hand to snatch it. The lady lifted her hand above her head before they could swipe it away from her. \"Nah, ah ah! You get the treat after we go in there.\" She pointed to the boarded up buildings. Shoe gurgled, sinking back inside their box so that only their eyes were peeking out. The boxtroll looked back and forth from the houses to the cookie in Pepper's hand. With a huff, they emerged slowly and trudged forward, annoyed that they had to work for their prize. The windows and doors were all boarded up on every home in the court; very few entrances were available to any of the apartments. The only one that was accessible, with an actual working door, was the middle house straight ahead of them. The door was the only normal looking thing about the home though. The windows were still covered up with planks of wood and the bricks were worn and old with moss growing all over, almost encompassing the whole building. Shoe hid behind Pepper as she tried to open the door, but surprisingly it was locked. She tried again but still no budge. She looked around and moved over to the house next door where a doorway was boarded up with some planks. She began pulling on the center plank. The wood was so old that with only a few pulls form the small woman it cracked right off. She did the same to four more of the planks, leaving only two on top that she couldn't reach. She stepped inside, ducking underneath the top boards with Shoe hesitantly following behind her, holding on to her skirt for safety. Although it was daylight outside, the inside of the building was very dark. The only thing lighting it was the sunlight beaming in through door where they entered. Pepper dug through her bag for the flashlight and pulled it out as soon as she found it. She flicked it on and shined it around the space. Dust floated between the flashlight and the spotlight on the other end. It looked like a regular house for the most part. It wasn't even dirty or dusty, it looked rather well-kept in fact. They appeared to be in some kind of living room, standing on a wooden floor with a rug between two chairs and a small table. They slowly walked around the quaint area. She shined the light towards the right, expecting a wall separating the buildings. Instead they found that only half of the wall was standing there. Whoever lived there must have taken it out and extended their home into the other apartments. Pepper and Shoe walked through to the other side of the room and saw to the left a staircase. To the right was a door, presumably the one they tried entering before that was locked. Pepper cautiously unlocked it and peeked out onto he streets of the court just to make sure her guess was right. After a moment, she closed it and looked up the stairs. Shoe was still hanging on to her skirt from behind. She reached a hand toward the little creature and they took it. Hand in hand they made their way up the stairs. At the top of the steps, a hallway extended down to the right. There were two doors and a grandfather clock ticking at the end. To the left of where they stood though was another staircase, ascending higher up into the house. Pepper began to go up, but Shoe pulled back a bit in resistance. She gave a small squeeze to their hand in response, and the boxtroll gulped, realizing they had no choice but to go up the stairs with her. The stairs were narrow, and when it seemed like they were at the top they had found that there even more stairs to the left that lead up to a door. This whole staircase was wooden and didn't seem to match the quaint style of the rest of the house. Pepper could feel herself getting chills; something was hiding up there. She opened the door and it creaked open ominously. She shined her light in before entering. The room appeared to be some kind of attic. It seemed empty, until they stepped in and noticed a few bones lying around on the floor, as well as torn and blood stained white sheets from a bed. They both gasped in surprised. Shoe was shaking as they escaped into their box. Pepper gulped as she continued shining the light and observing the room. It looked like there was once a window on the right wall, but it was boarded up. Unlike the other windows boarded up on the front of the house, it looked like much more effort was put into patching up this window and making sure nothing came in or went out. She shined the light slowly around the room some more until she reached the left wall. She gasped as she saw claw marks scratched along the wood. She backed up and tripped over he box friend, dropping her flashlight. The box squealed and little feet emerged. Shoe began to make a run for it but instead of going out the door he bumped into the wall. They stumbled for a moment, dizzy from the hit, and backed up far enough to trip and go tumbling down the stairs. \"Shoe!\" Pepper shouted as she stumbled to her feet and shoved her flashlight into her bag. She picked up her skirt as she ran down the stairs to help him. She found him at the very bottom of the attic stairs in the hallway with the grandfather clock, moaning and groaning as they tried to stand up, still only their feet sticking out of their box. Pepper helped them up, but froze as she heard the front door at the bottom of the stairs. She picked up the boxtroll and bolted for one of the doors down the hall. She entered the first door to the right and shut it quietly, but quickly, behind her. She leaned against it as she listened for a sound. She tried to stay silent but couldn't help her heavy breathing. Someone had entered the house and was walking around downstairs. She looked around the room for an exit, but it was dark. She pulled her flashlight back out and shined it all around as fast she could to look for an exit. It looked like they were in a bedroom, with a bed centered on the wall and a dresser to the left of the door. The only available exit was a window above the bed, but it was sealed shut like the other windows to the house. If she tried to get out through there it would make to much noise and attract the person, not to mention they were on the second floor. It seemed like they were trapped. Footsteps came up the stairs and without another moment to lose, she dove under the bed, dragging her small friend with her. Shoe poked out their head, not enjoying being carried around. Pepper shushed him before the door opened. All they could see were a pair of boots that entered and walked about. Whoever it was, they knew Pepper and Shoe were in the house and were looking for them. The woman closed her eyes and prayed as she did her best to keep her breathing as quiet as a mouse. The feet wandered around, but promptly exited the room and closed the door behind them. Pepper waited a moment before emerging, as she heard the feet walk away. She crawled out from under the bed and gestured for Shoe to come with her. They shook their head, to frightened to leave their hiding place now. \"We have to get out of here!\" she whispered as she grabbed his hand and pulled him out. The poor thing was shaking. Both of them were. Pepper leaned her ear against the door, but couldn't hear anything. She took a long, deep breath and opened the door slowly. She poked her head out and saw only the dark hallway. She patted her skirt, signaling for Shoe to follow. They tiptoed out, but as she shut the door a man was standing behind it. Shoe jumped inside their box and screamed from within. Pepper screamed out loud and began thrashing her arms wildly to protect herself. \"STAY BACK! I MAY BE A LADY BUT I CAN FIGHT BETTER THAN ANY MAN!\" The man gently grabbed her arms and calmed her down, \"Woah, slow down there lassy! Ya got little fists off ire, ya do!\" Pepper stopped to get a good look at the man. It was that oddly normal guy she hated named Thane. \"Wh- What are you doing here?\" she asked. He was the last person she expected to see. \"Well, I live here!\" he smiled cheerfully letting her arms go, nervously running his hands though his curly red hair. \"I think the better question would be what are you doing here? This is me house after all.\" Pepper stepped back and fixed her dress, feeling slightly embarrassed. \"Uh, well… It's a long story.\" she admitted. Shoe gurgled by her feet, and shuffled closer to her, still inside their box. A loud chime was heard at the end of the hall behind Thane. They all looked to see a tall grandfather clock striking six. Thane, for once, stopped smiling and turned back to the lady. \"I do beg your pardon, Ms…\" \"Pepper.\" He nodded, \"Pepper. Yes, Ms. Pepper. I do beg your pardon,\" he repeated, \"but I need you to leave immediately .\" He was trying to be as polite as possible, but was speaking quickly as to get them to vacate. Pepper was surprised, \"You- You're not going to press charges or anything for breaking and entering?\" Thane shook his head, slightly chuckling at the notion. \"No, of course not. In fact, if you leave right now we can just forget the whole thing ever happened. Tonight is a full moon and I need you out immediately.\" Thane gently placed his hands on her shoulders, turned her around, and lead her to the top of the stairs. She shook herself from his grip and turned to face him. \"Why are you so worried about a full moon?\" She questioned sharply. The answers began to suddenly unfold before her. The Irish man was flustered, \"Well, just… Because-\" his face fell as he realized, \"I don't need to explain myself to you. This is my house.\" He stood above her, giving her a stern glare. Any kindness he had was now swept under the rug. He didn't have time for any of this nonsense. Pepper wasn't buying any of it though, and easily shot the glare right back at him. \"You're acting awfully suspicious, Mr. Thane. Care to explain?\" she crossed her arms, waiting for an explanation. The man had just about had enough of all of this questioning. He slammed his right hand against the wall, making a loud thud, and stared into Pepper's eyes intensly. \"Look here, lil lass. If you know what's good for ya, you'll skedaddle out of here right now. Got it?\" She was shocked by the gesture and could feel herself shaking a bit once again. Despite it though, she kept her stern face, demanding her answers. Thane sighed, \"Trust me. It's for your own good.\" His eyes were softer now, as if he was pleading at this point. He looked around, noticing the little lighting the house had was fading away. It was almost too late. He quickly bolted past the woman and up the attic stairs. Pepper ran after him, \"Sir, wait-\" He shouted down to her from the top, \"THERE IS NO TIME! GET OUT!\" He reached for the door knob but froze before he could make contact. It was happening. He could feel himself shifting into his alter ego form. Pepper backed down the stairs as she heard the man grunting in pain. All she could see was a shadow on the wall of a man morphing into a grotesque beast. She backed up too far once again, and tripped over her friend, falling back onto her butt once again. Shoe was still shaking like a leaf, but he wouldn't move. A loud howl came from the top of the stairs and Pepper had to cover her ears it was so loud. The shadow sniffed the air and turned the corner. Through the darkness, Pepper could see two glowing yellow eyes looking directly at her. She shakily and slowly pulled out her flashlight and shined it towards the creature. It was large and covered in auburn-brown fur, with claws as big as her face. The monster barked loudly as it bounded down the stairs towards Pepper. She quickly scavenged her bag for the gun, but she couldn't find it in time. She saw Shoe a couple feet in front of her, and just as the werewolf jumped, she leapt and covered her friend to protect them. The werewolf went right over her and Shoe, sliding across the floor and hitting the grandfather clock at the end of the hall. It chimed loudly as it busted in half and fell over onto the monster. It barked as it tried to untangle itself. Pepper took her opportunity and picked up the boxtroll as she bolted down the stairs. When she reached the bottom she used on hand to search for the gun once again. She could feel it at the bottom of her bag, but before she could pull i t out the werewolf was at the top of the stairs and chasing after them. She darted to the left towards the living room. The wolf landed swiftly at the bottom of the stairs and leapt forward, just catching the bottom of the lady's skirt in it's claw. She dropped Shoe as she went down to the ground, sending them rolling a few feet in front of her. The Boxtroll rolled and popped out its head as it watched the beast drag Pepper closer and closer. She tried to grab the floor and pull herself away but it was useless. She was staring into the eyes of the best as it roared in her face. She screamed loudly in fear. Shoe couldn't hide anymore, they cared about Pepper too much. He gave a bold, but shrill, battle cry as they launched themselves towards the werewolf. The wolf looked up at the boxtroll just as they landed on it's head and began pulling at its hair. The werewolf reared up, letting loose Pepper's skirt. She quickly stood up and backed against one of the planked windows as she watched the wolf move past her trying to grab at Shoe. The boxtroll bravely took a bite at the wolf's ear and it howled in pain. It then grabbed shoe by the back of their box and threw them across the room, hitting one of the chairs and knocking it over. \"SHOE!\" Pepper shouted, unfortunately getting back the monsters attention. He jumped at her, but she ducked and rolled out of the way just in time for the beast to go crashing through the rickety planks and out onto the streets of Casein Court. The wolf growled and shook the dust and specs of wood out of it's fur. It was ready to go back for the woman and the troll, but paused and sniffed the air. He looked above to see lights from the top of town. It gave a low snarl and leaped up, scaling the building and landing on the rooftop. It howled loudly toward the full moon before bounding up Cheesebridge for fresh prey. Pepper caught her breath as she tried to regain composure. She quickly remembered her friend and ran over to the chair where he was tossed aside. \"Shoe! Shoe, are you alright?\" she asked as she held the small creature in her arms. He was unconscious, but still breathing. \"Oh, Shoe…\" she felt tears forming in her eyes. She sniffled and held him close as she began to cry. She had never been more scared in her life. Shoe regained consciousness and moaned in pain Pepper pulled away from them and smiled, happy to see they were alright. \"Oh, Shoe,\" she said again, \"you saved my life.\" The box troll gurgled happily as they smiled weakly. Pepper picked them up and pulled out the gun from her knapsack. She grumbled at it, angry she couldn't have reach it sooner. \"Come on, Shoe dear. We got a werewolf to kill.\"[Chapter 9] Molly was shaking as she sat at her makeup table backstage. She was so nervous she could cry. Not only for the show, but for everything to come afterwards. She still feared greatly for her and Mr. Pickles' relationship. As brutish as he had become she couldn't just halt her feelings for him all at once. She had to admit some love still resided in her heart. Trying to get it all to vanish completely was just impossible, a spark would always be there. And if Mr. Pickles were to miraculously change and be back to his normal self she would not hesitate to forgive him wholeheartedly, as naive as that may be. She still had hope for him. The lady looked in the mirror in full costume, makeup, and hair. She was in a large burgundy dress made of a satin material with gold trimmings and a small matching hat pinned into her hair. Her hair was pulled into a ponytail undo she did not usual adorn. She looked like Elizabeth, but she didn't feel like her tonight. She didn't feel confident, beautiful, sexy, or brave. She felt cold and heartbroken, and worst of all betrayed. Love had given her another run for her money, and this time it was for good. She slowly opened the drawer of the vanity table and carefully took out a small pouch she had brought with her from home. She peeked inside and contemplated to herself for a moment. \"Ms. Molly!\" Ms. Bonaparte startled her from behind, \"It is almost time! Are you ready, dear?\" Molly held the pouch tightly in her hand, hoping the seamstress did not see it. \"Uh, yes. Just about!\" she didn't look up at the lady, she kept her eyes focused on herself in the mirror with a straight face. Right away Ms. B knew something was up. \"What is in your hand there, darling?\" she asked. Molly hesitated, she couldn't lie to Ms. B. No one could, it was part of the dress maker's charm. The blonde sighed and handed it to her. Ms. Bonaparte opened it and with two fingers lifted out by the chain the necklace Mr. Pickles had gotten her before. She sighed, \"Oh, child. You know he is no good for you anymore.\" Molly sniffled, holding back tears, \"I know…\" she let out weakly. Mrs. Bonaparte felt a lot of empathy for her friend. She had been through trials herself, and she knew how tough men could be on such a soft heart. She took the necklace in her hands and put it around Molly's neck. It sat perfectly on her collarbone above the low neckline of her dress. The pink and gold clashed just a teensy bit with the red and gold costume, but Ms. Bonaparte for once did not care about perfection. She placed her hands on Molly's shoulders and looked at her through the mirror. \"Perhaps if you wear it, he will remember and have some change of heart, yes?\" Molly sniffled once more, but this time smiled as a tear escaped her eye. Mrs. B handed her a tissue and Molly quickly dabbed away the drop, being sure as not to disturb her makeup. \"Thank you.\" she turned and hugged her supportive friend. The wise woman hugged her back and then released. \"Come on then, you have a show to put on.\" They gave each other encouraging nods and were off to their places. Molly stood on stage left as she looked out at the audience full of faces she knew and loved, and some others not so much. She took deep breaths as she waited for curtains. Mr. Pickles stepped in beside her, waiting as well. Molly held in a gasp as she stood next to him. She puffed out her chest hoping he'd notice the necklace, but he didn't give her so much as a sideways glance. She decided to try a different approach. \"I'm so nervous.\" she started. \"Don't worry about it.\" Mr. Pickles began. Molly's hope beamed through a smile. \"They'll all be looking at me!\" he gloated. Her hope dropped in an instant. What she thought was about to be some encouragement turned into a mere shallow comment. She huffed as she turned on her heel away from him. She couldn't stand the new Pickles, and it killed her. Promptly at six, the show began. Curtains opened and Hamilton was on stage with Mr. Pickles. They played out their scene and the audience clapped. Hamilton exited left while Pickles exited right. He was alone on stage right while Molly took her place. She did her best not to look at him and stay in character while the curtain opened on her scene. As she performed a monologue on stage, Mr. Pickles' eye twitched. He suddenly found himself not feeling well. He lifted his hand to his forehead as he could feel his head start to spin. He was losing balance, as he realized that something was wrong. He began morphing into his werewolf form, much to everyone else's unknowing. Molly finished up on stage, \"But where, oh where, will I ever find someone like that?\" On cue, Mr. Pickles burst out on stage, but he was no longer Mr. Pickles. He was a ferocious beast covered in brunette fur and a torn suit. He had claws and stood on his now hind legs, looking ready to hunt for prey. The audience gasped at the sight of the monster, ignorantly impressed with the effort put into the costume. Molly gasped with them, unsure how to roll with it. She quickly looked out into the audience to see if the director, sitting in the front row, had anything to say. She could barely see her through the lights, but if her eyes were correct, Winnie was in shock as well. Molly looked back at the wolf-like creature as it slowly starts up a low growling and stepped towards her. She took steps back in sync with his, \"Hehe um… Bartholomew?\" she tried staying in character. He began to growl louder, looking about ready to pounce. Molly tried again, to afraid to stay in character anymore, \"Monty?\" With that, the beast barked and bounded towards her. She screamed and ran off stage left, the creature following behind her. Everyone backstage watched from the threshold between the curtain and the stage. As they came running back, everyone either stepped out of the way or hid to get away from the monster. As the stage was left empty the audience began to murmur. Winnie grumbled in her seat as everything fell apart before her eyes. Suddenly from one of the doors on stage, Herbert emerged cheerfully. \"Why it seems Elizabeth isn't home this evening. Good thing too! I need to meet with her father in private at once!\" he sat courtly at the couch in the fake living room, happy to finally have a part in the show. Winnie kept herself under control from her seat as he began to turn her exquisite play into \"The Herbert Trubshaw Hour.\" Meanwhile Molly was running down stairs to the basement under the stage. She was practically carrying her skirt in her hands as not to trip on it while she ran. She couldn't help but stumble a few times, but she managed to evade Mr. Pickles as he attempted to claw and bite at her. She ran through the crowded basement. As she passed by a tall stack of hat boxes, she knocked them over in front of the wolf's path to give her more time to get away. It didn't do much to help though, he jumped over it with ease and continued to chase her up the stairs to stage right. She ran around curtains and corridors until she found herself trapped by an empty set of stacked tables and chairs. \"Oh no…\" she muttered to herself. Mr. Pickles barked, causing her to turn sharply toward him. He growled as he took one step closer to her. \"Oh, Monty, please! You know me! Molly! Molly Monte Cristo!\" she tried to explain. The monster growled louder, and she raised her arm in front of her face in fear. Suddenly, from a small window near the ceiling backstage, the clouds parted and a light shined in from the moon. The light hit Molly's necklace and gleamed pink and gold. Mr. Pickles stopped in his tracks, going dead silent as he caught sight of the gemstone. The glistening of the necklace sent him whirring back into a memory in his mind. He remembered giving Molly that necklace, he remembered sacrificing his most prized possession for her to have it, and he remembered her gratitude, her appreciation, her smile, as she said, \"Oh Monty… It's so lovely.\" The glistening of the pink stone was reminiscent of the green glistening of her eyes. How could he ever forget that? Molly lowered her hand and watched him stare. He was in a trance, he was suddenly himself for a second. More himself than he had been all week. Underneath the fur and the claws she could see the man she loved once again. She could see it in his eyes as he remembered how much he loved her. As the memory sinked in, Mr. Pickles backed away, whimpering in humiliation. He ran away on all fours in fear he would try to hurt Molly again. She went after him, \"Mr. Pickles! Wait! I want to help you\" Meanwhile, Pepper was running up Curd's Way carrying an injured Shoe in her left arm, and a loaded gun in her right hand. The boxtroll would gurgle every few moments, their arm in a lot of pain. She would nuzzle them tightly towards her, and assure them that everything would be alright. As she finally approached the theater, she could see the werewolf Thane lurking on the rooftops of the building, sniffing to find a way in. He managed to find a hatch and rip it open, jumping down inside the building. Pepper gasped and quickly ran around to the alley and through the backstage door. On stage, Hamilton and Herbert were running the show. \"You know I always loved you!\" Hamilton shouted, his arms open wide. Herbert threw his arms open and responded loudly, \"I was hoping you did!\" they then grabbed each other and came in for a passionate kiss. Winnie groaned as her horror tragedy turned into a mushy romance. She could hear Sir Langsdale and Sir Broderick in the seats behind he sniffling and murmuring to one another, \"I knew they would get together!\" Mr. Pickles ran past them on stage, every couple of feet looking back at Molly who was running after him. He ran off stage left, Herbert saying, \"Oh look, there goes your colleague and your daughter.\" Before Molly cold run off stage though, the original werewolf, who was much larger and much more terrifying than Mr. Pickles, jumped down from the ceiling and roared loudly at the lady. She screamed as it raised it's paw to swat her, but before he could, Mr. Pickles leaped onto his back and began biting and brawling for his love's safety. Molly ran over to Herbert and Hamilton as they and the audience watched the fight take place before them. The audience was impressed, the cast and crew were mortified, and Molly was worried Mr. Pickles wouldn't make it out in one piece. Pepper burst in backstage and carefully handed off Shoe to Ms. Bonaparte who took them in her arms like a baby. The small woman then ran on stage with her gun and shouted, \"Stand back everyone!\" The audience let out another gasp as this new character entered. Winnie covered her face, unable to watch the rest of her dreams unfold. It was hard for Pepper to aim with both the wolves fighting each other, one on top, then the other on bottom, throwing each other around and almost hitting the other actors on stage. Thane threw Mr. Pickles down on the ground. He let out a whimper as he was knocked unconscious. Molly reached out as if she could help, but Herbert held her back. Pepper finally got a clear shot of Thane's chest as he lifted his arm to attack. With one swift pull of the trigger she fired the silver bullet right into his heart. The loud bang silenced the theater. Thane froze, then fell to his knees and not his side beside his victim. Molly quickly ran to Mr. Pickles side, but stopped as he, and Thane, began transforming back into their human selves. Blood was covering the remains of Thane's torn shirt. Pepper hesitantly stepped closer to him and with his last breath he looked at her and muttered, \"Thank you.\" then his head fell and he was still. Hamilton took one step and gestured to Pepper, \"Twas beauty that killed the beast.\" he lowered his head in respects dramatically. Pepper rolled her eyes, \"Oh shut it.\" She shoved her gun in her apron pocket as the curtain closed. The audience was quiet, until Payton and Sybil, the town taxidermist, stood up together and started clapping rapidly, \"Bravo! Bravo!\" they whooped and holler and whistled. Soon everyone in the audience was standing up to join them. Hamilton and Herbert burst out from behind the curtain and took their bows at least three times while the crowd went wild. Behind the curtain, Molly held Mr. Pickles head in her lap. A tear rolled down her eye and landed on his face. Her hope was restored for the millionth time, but yet again taken from her as she feared her love was dead. Mr. Pickles nose twitched as the drop landed on his cheek. His eyes fluttered open and he looked up at Ms. Molly from the awkward position. He quickly shot up and off of Molly's lap, embarrassed. \"Oh, Ms- Ms. Molly! My apologies.\" \"Why, Mr. Pickles! Your mustache is gone!\" she exclaimed, covering her smile with her hands as he felt his face and sighed at the missing facial hair. He shrugged it off and looked back at the lady who was trying hard to contain herself. \"A- Are you alright, Ms. Molly?\" he asked with concern. \"I am now, thanks to you! My hero!\" she lurched forward and hugged him. He almost fell to his back as she clung to him, pinning his arms down at his side. He looked at Ms. Pepper confused as ever. She shook her head at Molly's shenanigans and looked back at Thane. She was glad all this nonsense was finally over, but wondered how on earth she would deal with this actual dead man on their stage.[Chapter 10] Everything seemed to go back to normal in Cheesebridge, for the most part. Although Thane was dead, no one seemed to know him close enough to even notice his disappearance. It had seemed he kept up a nice and normal demeanor to keep everyone from finding out his secret. Luckily Pepper had explained everything to Payton and she helped them take care of it. \"Technically it wasn't a 'murder' per se.'\" the mortician explained, \"It was more of an act of defense. He was attacking people, wasn't he?\" Pepper nodded in agreement as they stood in the morgue with a white sheet draped over the dead body on a metal table. Shoe was not too badly injured, much to everyone's delight. They simply sprained their little boxtroll wrist. One trip to the vet and they were good as new, although they were not delighted to go there in the first place. Mr. Trout was waken up the next morning after all the commotion by Pepper. He was alarmed that he had slept through the whole thing. \"Don't you worry, Mr. Trout. I took care of the whole thing!\" Pepper assured him. \"You- You did?\" he asked in disbelief. She nodded proudly, \"Of course. You know i'm a lot tougher than I look.\" Mr. Trout chuckled. \"Well, you do look pretty tough.\" he joked. She gave him a playful shove on the arm. Mr. Pickles was completely clueless to most of the events that happened that week. All he really remembered was having a mustache, and he missed it so. When Molly and Mr. Trout tried to explain everything to him, he was completely baffled and didn't believe much of it. It didn't matter if he did or not though, what was important was that he was now back to his normal self. A week after event took place, Sybil called everyone to her shop for a surprise presentation. Pepper, Mr. Trout, Molly, Mr. Pickles, Herbert, Winnie, Eggs, Fish, Shoe, Payton, and Hamilton all joined to see what she had made. \"Behold! My latest creation. I call it 'Ode to Werewolf.'\" She tore a patched up sheet off a life-size replica of the Thane werewolf. The audience gasped at the sight of it. Molly felt a bit faint from the memory of being almost slaughtered by the monster. Mr. Pickles held her as she almost fell to the floor. \"How on earth did you get it so accurate?\" Pepper asked, observing the taxidermy project up close. It really was almost exact, and Sybil had not even been nearly as close to Thane as she had been. Sybil folded up the sheet in her hands and tossed it aside, \"I got that photographic memory.\" she tapped her head, \"I just used some bear, wolf, jack rabbit, dog, and voila! We got ourselves a one of a kind, life-size werewolf!\" She placed her hands on her hips happy with her project. Payton clapped her hands, impressed with the creature. Everyone else was rather disturbed, but appreciated the work put into it. After their small get together, Mr. Pickles escorted Molly back home as he usually did. He was still trying to wrap his head around the idea of himself being a jerk to everyone in town. He never thought he could be that kind of person. His conscience was to clean and good to even try to act mean to anyone, especially Molly. \"I apologize if I did anything… Brutish.\" he began. \"Oh it's fine, Molly shrugged it off easily, \"after all you weren't quite yourself anyway.\" Mr. Pickles thought through everything and continued asking questions to help refresh his memory, \"So we didn't finish the play?\" Molly giggled at this, remembering how angry Winnie was. Although after the show everyone congratulated her on how great it all went and how impressed they were with the production. \"No, not the one we rehearsed anyway.\" she answered truthfully. Mr. Pickles cleared his throat, \"So I didn't kiss you?\" He was sure he would remember something great like that, but then again, he didn't remember a lot of what happened. Molly stopped at this, thinking about it. She completely forgot they had to kiss on stage. \"No…\" she coughed, \"Unfortunately.\" \"What?\" \"Nothing!\" she waved it off as they approached her house. She stepped up onto one of the steps to her front door. \"Anyway, I should be off. Goodnight, Mr. Pickles.\" She gently grab his face and gave him a small peck on the cheek. He was instantly in a daze, with hearts in his eyes. She was already walking inside her house before he could stutter out, \"G- G- Goodnight, Ms. M- Molly!\" ","Summary":" Winifred Portley-Rind paced in front of the first row of seats in the newly built Cheesebridge thea"},{"Movie":"RocknRolla","Title":"He Runs To The Abbey","Author":"BrokenForYouSpilledForYou","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6804404","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I own nothing pertaining to RocknRolla, except for any characters unrecognized to the movie. His eyes are blazing. She knows she should have told him in a more delicate way, but he'd been frantic. He was going crazy, demanding answers. The only option she'd had was to blurt it out. She regrets it, but there simply wasn't another option. He shoves his trademark magnum in the back of his pants as he charges for the door, reaching for his trench coat madly. The only thing she can think to do is throw herself in front of him, keeping him at bay for at least a few moments. \"Don't!\" The word tears out of her throat before she can stop it, ricocheting loudly off the walls of the small room like an explosive. She splays her hands across his chest, trying to ignore the eruption of sparks she feels in her fingertips; This is the first time she's had to get physical with him in ages, feel his warmth and the erratic rhythm of his speeding heart. \"Don't go!\" His nostrils flair as he lets out an angry sigh, allowing his hot breath to hit her face while he glares down at her. \"Why not?\" She swallows...hard. \"Because...\" Think. \"Because you need to stay here for Abby! She needs you to be strong for her!\" She hopes the mention of Abby will soften him, but it seems to have the opposite affect, as she finds herself having to push harder on his chest. \"I am being strong for her! I'm doing this because she's not strong enough to do it! Too kind! Too ill!\" She shoves with all her might, managing to throw him off balance a few steps. \"Archy, don't!\" His eyes pierce her, almost going through her like beams. He swallows, too, straightening his coat while trying to gain control over his unsteady breaths. \"Why not? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't go and kill 'im right now.\" She stares at him with watery eyes, her bosom heaving while she backs away, spreading herself across the door. \"She's afraid of men as it is. How do you think she'll react when she finds out you murdered him?\" \"She doesn't have to know.\" \"She's smart, Archy. She'll put two and two together. And when she does, she'll be terrified of you.\" He stands and considers. Lizzie's right. Abby is a smart girl. She'd probe the both of them upon hearing of her attacker's death, and she'd ask just the right questions, too. Little questions, asking for details that appear to be insignificant, that will lead her to the correct conclusion. And that's only one of the many things he loves about her. She's an inquisitive young woman, gaining information through her own hard research, learning for her own benefit...because she has the right. That's also why he has to kill the person that's done this to her...that's made her so weak and afraid, timid, back to the quiet person she had only just started to break free of. \"I have to do it.\" Lizzie braces herself against the door, ensuring her body is pressed painfully against the doorknob and locks. \"This is wrong.\" He stops just inches from her face, breathing fire on her smooth skin again. \"And what they did to her is right ?\" \"I didn't say that!\" She snaps. \"I'm saying, you should cool off, and go comfort Abby. Think logically of your next move. That's what you do, isn't it? You think about what you should do next in your line of work, and then you execute. Apply it here. There's someone very weak and hurt in the next room, and she needs your attention now, more than he does.\" Her voice is softer now, lulling, her lips barely brushing his chin. \"Go on, Archy. Contemplate the next move logically. Think of what hurts him the most, and think of how to do it without having a run-in with the police. Please. I don't want her to lose you to prison again.\" His breathing is easier now, eyes pregnant with thought, rather than blind rage. He studies her eyes carefully, noticing for the first time how close they are to his. All he can manage is a nod, lumbering off without another word to the bedroom to his left. He doesn't like sobbing women, but seeing as this one shares his own blood, he can't stop himself from easing down on his side, scooping the limp figure against his brawny frame. To be continued...[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own RocknRolla, with the exception of characters that are unfamiliar to the film. People are like pigeons. They have the potential of being pretty, however they chuck it out the window with their greed. Or, perhaps it's just the barbaric instinct to survive. You do need money, after all, to get the things that are crucial for a healthy, hygienic life. Greed. Survival. The two could be interchanged, depending on the person. They strut around like cretins, looking for attention, asking for a handout. Occasionally, if you're lucky, one of them will take a dump on you. Archy has seen it many times. Done it himself, too. He notes, sitting on the park bench, the strutting. A few birds do it just close enough to his feet. A few yards away, a few boys do it in front of a small group of chicks out on picnic. He shakes his head, glancing back down at his newspaper. He'd been there a few times. Not that he really had to try all that hard. Fluff a few colorful feathers, strut, charm. Voilà. His mobile rings. Irritated, he folds the paper again, scanning the people around him while he answers. He can't believe it. It seems so unreal, yet at the same time, he knows it's possible. He questions, asking if they're certain, making sure he's the man they're looking to speak to. He is. He asks if it's just a sick joke, if his brother is just getting back at him for some bad blood he'd forgotten about. It's not. He nods, though he knows they can't see it, and stands from his perch on the park bench. He hates the smell of the morgue. Too bad. It's only his first trip here. It's too \"clean\", yet disgusting at the same time. Chemicals attack his nostrils, some he can name, some not. Formaldehyde is the overpowering one. He can control himself well enough, though all he wants to do is gag. He pushes the girth of his trench coat to the sides, shoving his hands in his pockets while looking to the fellow on his left. He's a short man, nearly a head shorter than Archy. His white lab coat compliments his hair and skin, making his blue eyes stand shockingly out from his face. It also makes the eyes want to blend him with the wall, making Archy look up along the hallway again. They turn left into a corridor. A few people pass by them; three women are sobbing their eyes out, one barely even able to walk she's doing it so hard. Archy regards her with creased brows, glancing discreetly at her once she's passed him. \"See it all the time.\" The mortician says lightly. \"I'd say I felt sorry for them, if I weren't used to it by now. Working in this business numbs you, lad.\" He quirks a brow, remaining silent. He can't remember the last time someone called him \"lad\", and as far as being numbed...that happened a long time ago. They finally stop outside of one of the many doors in the corridor, the mortician pausing to knock. Archy takes note of a young woman sitting beside it, in a chair. Her legs are drawn up to her chest, arms resting on the knees, face buried in the crook of one elbow. All he can tell is that her hair is blonde, her skin is pale...and she's crying. He looks up when the door opens, allowing himself to be led into the room. It's fairly empty, save for a few chairs cast off to the sides. A window rests in the far wall, blinds open and allowing sunlight to drift into this dreary place. His eyes follow the bright, golden rays to a trolley table in the middle of the room, a dull turquoise tarp draped over the top. The shape beneath it helps him to brace himself against what could be an ugly truth. Walking forward, he nods to a second mortician, and the tarp is lifted. The breath whooshes slowly from his lungs, over his tongue and through his teeth. The man is white as milk, eyes firmly shut. He can see red splotches in the more grayed-out areas of the hair...a small detail the morticians either missed or just couldn't get out. There are also a few splotches in the dark eyebrows, set over what would be intimidating eyes. The nose is strong, but broken, leading down to lips set in a thin line, a rather large nick in the lower lip, towards the center. He follows the neck down to a barreled-chest, dusted lightly with a patch of salt and pepper hair. He can see a tear in the skin, peaking just from underneath the tarp, slightly above the right breast; It's a hole, round, clean. So that's how... He's only able to stare for a few moments, unable to think. What did you get into that merited a death? He can hear his pulse racing, thick and heavy in his ears. Shades of red pulsate behind his eyelids. He pinches the bridge of his nose. Why... The morticians stare at him, the one holding the tarp opting to speak. \"Is this him?\" He swallows, steps back. \"Yeah, that's him. That's Richie...my brother.\" The second mortician pulls the drape up and over the head again, while the first one turns back toward the door. \"We figured that's who it was, but the girl was just acting so oddly.\" Archy gives the man his full attention, brows creasing curiously, eyes piercing. \"What girl?\" \"The girl. Blonde thing sulking outside the door. We called her first, the daughter. But she was in such a panic when she got here, we were afraid that she didn't really get a good look.\" Daughter. He's been so absorbed in the fact that his baby brother has been murdered...Not that he'd been a saint during his span of life, but he hadn't been bad, messed up...like himself. He swallows a little harder than usual, letting out a steady stream of air through his nose. Putting up with his own grief is going to be a task...but someone else's? The door opens again, allowing just enough space for Archy to walk through, then closes. The kid is still there, curled up in fetal position. How does she do that in such a small chair? Awkwardly, he reaches out a hand, molding it over her right shoulder. \"Abby?\" Abby's head snaps up like a mouse trap, red-rimmed, puffy eyes wide and startled. She jumps to her feet, gasping. She's more grown up than Archy remembers. The top of her head almost reaches his chest, when it barely cleared his belt buckle, last he saw her. The features of her face are more pronounced, brows dark, despite her blonde hair. She has her mother's nose, small, petite, set over full lips. It's the eyes, though, that have his attention. Brilliant green, almost like emeralds. Just like Richie's...just like his own. He reaches for her again, pausing when she flinches. \"Abby, it's me. You remember Uncle Archy?\" He doesn't expect her to right off, though he silently hopes. She hasn't seen him in five years, four of which he'd been locked up. She stares at him with slight confusion, wiping madly at the tears streaking down her cheeks. She can barely breathe, barely focus, but she wills her logical side up to the front of the line. This man is extremely tall, very much like her father...was. She can't bare to think of him in the past-tense, doesn't want to. But...she has to. A new wave of pain surges through her chest, taking her breath away. It plummets down the length of her torso, down into her stomach, like a kick in the gut. She hunches over slightly, folding her fingers over her belly. Strong nose, just like dad... She only has to glance at his eyes to know he's telling the truth. \"Uncle...\" It's soft, only just a whisper. He opens his arms, takes a few steps toward her. \"Come on, give us a cuddle.\" She can smell his cologne when she presses her face to his chest; Not too strong, but definitely masculine. She clings to him like he's seen her every day without interruption, crying openly into the white fabric of his shirt. Archy holds her just as tightly, unsure really of what else to do. He strokes a small circle with his left thumb on her upper back, caresses her hair with his right hand. He doesn't like sobbing women, but seeing as this one shares his own blood, it would be wrong not to comfort her. He bends his head over hers, thinking, and sighs through his nose. \"We should go.\" He murmurs. She untangles herself from him, a silent agreement, unable to look at him or speak. \"You still live at the same address?\" She nods, and they walk in silence to Archy's vehicle. The flat is just as he remembers. A tiny living room with a kitchen attached, the carpet turning to tile in that area. The windows are dirty, half hidden by white lace curtains (Abby's touch, Archy guesses). The wallpaper also used to be white, faded yellow with age. He takes a seat on the couch in front of the television, equally tiny to match the size of the room, while Abby collects her things. The move to his place will most likely be permanent. After all, he can't just turn a sixteen year old out into the world. Not without a job, money, a place to stay. This place will be too expensive for her to keep up on her own. He shakes his head. No. He'll support her for as long as necessary...or until she gets tired of him. He looks down at his watch after ten minutes, deciding to see if she's collapsed in a fit of tears in her room. She's not there, however, when he makes his way. He thinks it's her room, anyway. The walls are sky blue with white carpet, a bed with red sheets and pillowcases shoved in the upper left corner. He walks to the bag resting on top of it, noting the several pairs of pants and tops resting on the carpet. Brows furrowed, he turns and walks to the bedroom across the hallway. \"Abby?\" He calls. This is certainly his brother's room. White walls and bed sheets, pillowcases, with a general smell of leather and cologne in the air. \"Abby?\" Her head pokes up from the other side of the bed before she gets to her feet, staring at something in her hands. She turns and points a pistol at him when he approaches, causing him to flinch backwards with his hands raised. \"I...I think you should take this.\" She whispers. \"I don't know how to use it.\" Obviously. Cautiously, he wraps his fingers around the barrel and takes it from her, making sure to move his body out of the way first. \"Don't ever, ever point a gun at anyone...unless you intend to shoot them.\" She hangs her head quietly, tearing up again. \"Sorry.\" He sighs. He's not used to dealing with females...Emotional ones, anyway. His left arm drapes around her shoulders while he pockets the pistol, hand squeezing her shoulder. \"Let's finish getting you packed, hm? You're tired. The sooner we get to my place, the sooner you can rest.\" She manages to calm herself down by the time they reach Archy's flat. Her breathing is reduced to hiccups, nose heavily congested, but the tears have stopped. She nods her thanks when Archy and the driver allow in the house first, brows raising in awe at the polished wood floors and carved walls. She can't recall the last time she was in such a nice place, doesn't really care; this is her new home, and she'll treat it with as much respect as she does Archy. He smiles in partial amusement to himself, filing her expression away for another time, and places his hand on the base of her neck while he gives her the grand tour. It's not the greatest flat in London, not the shabbiest, either. He notes that she seems to like windows, for she checks the view of each one, allowing the sunlight to filter across her face. He gives her privacy when they reach the room that is to be hers, choosing to retire for at least a little while in front of the fire place in the study. The housekeeper offers him a glass of brandy, and he allows it to warm his belly as he drifts sadly off in his leather chair. Though the shower is refreshing, it's not enough to make Abby feel any better. She's grateful to Archy, truly, his actions aren't going unnoticed. She misses home, though. Home where her red bed sheets are, her vast collection of books...a bedroom across the hallway that smells like her father. She eases herself down on the edge of the tub, resting her chin on her fist. She could preserve the scent somehow, keeping a little piece of her father alive for as long as possible. He was in possession of quite a lot of jewelry, too; no problem carrying a piece of him with her. She stands. This is depressing. She tries to think of other things while she brushes her teeth, like how she'll ever thank Archy for all of this, or how soon she'll be ready to go back to school. School. There's a good distraction. I could bring my grades up this way. But the thought of trying forget her father just makes everything hurt worse. She reaches into the medicine cabinet to put her toothbrush away...and that's when she sees it. The toothbrush is forgotten, dropped onto some random shelf, replaced with a razor in her hand. Dad has one of these. Old-fashioned, straight-razor. Archy must share the same taste with dad in this area. She opens it, slowly, looking at the reflection of her eyes in the blade. So cold, yet inviting. Do I really want to start this up again? She pulls the the left sleeve of her robe down, revealing old, raised scars in the flesh of her wrist. It all began when her mother died. Years of therapy to stop. It hurt dad so much when he found out... She swallows, looking at the razor again. I can clean it up. Archy never has to know. The blade touches her skin, in the center of where two of the fleshy lines meet in an \"x\". There's no telling how long it'll take me to stop...once I start. He'll find out at one point. An image of Richie flashes through her mind. His beautiful smile, probably very similar to her uncle's. The way his eyes lit up just when she walked into the room. Then...then she just sees him in a puddle of his own blood...right there, on the sidewalk. She hadn't witnessed it, the shooting. Yet, she can see it happening all so clearly. Gone. His smile, his sparkling eyes, his encouraging words that always got her through the day, his soothing voice. The razor presses harder to her skin, then moves slowly to the right. Tears blur her vision as she feels the warmth seeping down her wrist, staining her forearm. She allows the tears to flow freely, before dropping the razor, searching the medicine cabinet for a way to stop the bleeding. To be continued...Feedback would be much appreciated.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I do not own anything pertaining to RocknRolla, except characters that aren't original to the movie. She's never been happier about rain. If she can be called happy, that is. With the cover of the rain, no one can really tell that she's crying. The only thing she doesn't like about it, is the fact that she can't feel herself crying. She knows she is, but with her entire face drenched, all she can feel are the rain drops, not tears. This way, it only feels like irregular breathing and congestion. She'll be inside the church, soon enough, where she'll dry off, and the fact will be obvious, aside from the tell-tale red eyes and trembling shoulders. Archy sits solemnly beside her, his face also wet, set in a determined frown. If it were any other occasion, Abby would think he looks smashing, dressed in his black suit and tie. But this isn't any other occasion, and she doesn't want to think of anyone looking particularly smashing while attending a funeral. She glances over at him, watches him stare (somewhat broodingly), out the window at the rain hitting the pavement. She realizes that he's awfully good at keeping his reserve. He looks dejected, yes, but he's not completely losing it...like her. She decides to look out the window as well, watch Londoners go about their daily business; They don't have a funeral go to. They don't look miserable. She looks down at her lap, at her hands folded neatly on top of her black dress. Apparently, she can't look at anyone without giving them a negative light; Hands will have to do...for now. The rain is positively pounding by the time they reach their destination. Archy reaches for the umbrella, but Abby climbs out of the vehicle before he or Turbo can assist her. She walks steadily in the rain, allowing it to soak her hair and drench her clothes once more, not stopping until she reaches the church. That's the daughter. Oh, she's soaking wet! Poor thing. Must be in denial. What's she going to do now? I heard her uncle took her in. Poor man. She ignores the voices, doesn't acknowledge the expressions of pity or the pats on the shoulders. She goes directly to the front, towards the alter, where the open casket waits for her. He looks peaceful, She decides. His hands are folded neatly atop his stomach, much like he used to do when he would nap on the couch. She stares at them, deciding to take one in her hand, resting the other on the edge of his coffin. So cold... 6 Years Prior... \" How was your day?\" A grumble is her response. Richie peeks at her from over the newspaper, quirking a brow. \"It couldn't have been that bad.\" \" I hate school. Everybody picked me to joke about.\" \" They're just jealous. And it couldn't have been everyone.\" He sets the paper aside, patting the spot next to him on the couch. \"Come here, darling.\" She shrugs her shoulders until the rucksack hits the floor, takes a seat beside him. She accepts her daily hug and kiss on the cheek, then sinks back against the couch. \"Everyone but the nerds.\" \" Nerds aren't bad; nerds make good friends.\" \" Not good. You get bullied for being friends with them, too.\" Richie snorts, opting to lean against the cushions as well. \"You can't live your life to please everyone.\" \" You say that all the time.\" \" Then it's about time you apply it, hm?\" He presses his lips together, widening his eyes a bit as he leans toward her. \"Hmm?\" She flicks her gaze to him, realizing he's just a nose-length away from her face. She tries to push him away with a chuckle, unable to dodge his multiple kisses. \"Daddy!\" \" Now, see? See what I did?\" She play sighs. \"What?\" \" I made you smile, and you stopped worrying.\" \" So?\" \" Sooo? What am I always telling you?\" \"Smile when the world is cold,\" She whispers into the casket, \"And it gets a bit brighter.\" \" Smile when the world is cold, and it gets a bit brighter.\" \"But what if I'm too sad?\" \" But what if I'm too sad?\" \" Then just try it on. Even for a few seconds. You might be surprised.\" \"And if I don't want to?\" \" And if I don't want to?\" \" It's the world's loss.\" She strokes his knuckles with her thumb, shoulders shaking. \"You always did think too highly of me.\" A heavy hand squeezes her shoulder. \"They're about to start; They've requested that we take our seats.\" Archy whispers. She allows herself to be steered away, sliding her hand up his arm and over the edge of the casket, before seating herself. She makes sure to sit particularly close to her uncle, enabling herself to at least be able to feel his warmth, feel the fact that at least he is still there to catch her, if he's willing to go that far. Archy pretends not to notice, though he does rest his arm over the back of the pew, hand dangling across her shoulder. The priest takes his place before the coffin, opens his Bible to a marked chapter. \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away-\" Abby shifts lightly, closes her eyes. I can do this. Deep breaths. \"We are not gathered to mourn his death, but to celebrate his life-\" She exhales largely through her nose, keeping her eyes shut. Her face is dry now, making her tears obvious. She tries to focus on her breathing, on keeping calm, rather than the milky corpse before her. \"What is death, but the beginning of life?\" She doesn't see Archy's doleful glance, doesn't feel his hand mold around the ball of her shoulder, thumb rubbing light circles when her entire upper body begins to shake. She can't hear the priest anymore. She can't even think; The moment a word begins to form, a memory replaces it. Just silent pictures, like those old-fashioned movies, except hers are in color. All of a sudden, she doesn't want to proceed with this funeral. She doesn't want to be sitting in this pew, she doesn't want to be conveniently situated next to Archy, she doesn't even want to be anywhere but her new room. It's all too much, too fast. She's brought back among the living when Archy completely moves away from her. She begins to follow, thinking the ceremony is over, when the priest moves from the podium, and Archy takes his place. He looks out across the small congregation, nodding briefly at some, making eye contact with a few. His elongated fingers grasp the sides of the podium, and he exhales deeply, before leaning toward the microphone. \"My name's Archy,\" He states quietly, \"Richie's brother. I'd like to thank you all for coming out, despite the weather; it shows that at some time or another, Richie meant something to you. Some of you I know, some I don't. Richie was good at making friends,\" Which makes it all the more difficult to believe someone killed him, \"Making it a bit hard to keep up with them all.\" He pauses to clear his throat, collect his thoughts while staring at some invisible imperfection in the woodwork of the podium. He locks eyes briefly with Abby, then looks back over the heads of the small group. They stare at him like owls, unblinking, minus the few that are actually crying. He would be amused that most of the tearfully mournful are women, were he not feeling the same way. \"He was a good husband, good father. Most men talk about sports, or their jobs. Richie was always telling a new story about something his family did.\" He stops again, hoping that no one notices how white his knuckles are turning. He takes in a shaky breath, unable to bring himself to look at Abby again; he can hear her sobbing from where he stands. He blinks rapidly for a moment, then stands straight once more. \"He'll be missed.\" He finishes weakly. Without another word, he nods to the priest. A few men rise from the audience (Turbo among them), to help him and the priest lift the casket. The rain hasn't let up at all since the funeral started. They all look to Archy. Archy listens, finding the distinct, higher-pitched sob from where he'd been sitting just a few minutes ago. With a nod, they continue out into the rain, making the priest's robes cling to his body, plastering Archy's hair to his head. Abby follows without hesitation, still wet from her earlier appointment with the weather. Some of the followers are pleased to find a tent set up over the plot, sufficiently shielding it from the elements. Abby's eyes are almost horror filled when the men begin to ease the coffin into the ground by rope. This is the final step, the point of no return. If they bury him, she'll never, ever see him again. She makes to go to the plot with a hoarse cry, only someone wraps their arm above her chest, pulling her back against them. She doesn't bother fighting back, her body too weak with the wracking wails. Her knees give out, her breath comes up short. Everything goes black. She doesn't open her eyes when she comes to. When the first drops of consciousness drip into her mind, she decides first to lie completely still where she is, taking in scent, listening to the sounds around her, feeling the hardness and texture against the backside of her body. She can hear rain, but instead of it pounding on the tarp, it sounds like it's tapping, ever so lightly, on a window. The smell in the air is no longer of precipitation, freshly tilled dirt and grass, mixtures of multiple perfumes and flowers, but of laundry detergent, soap, and some other scent she can't name off right away. Her head is aching, throbbing with each pulse of her heart. Confusion settles in after the initial gathering of the senses. She begins to wonder why she's lying down, why everything smells so clean, why her head hurts...where she is. She's got to open her eyes. Oh, but the headache...She decides to risk it. Perhaps if I open them slowly... She's greeted by a white ceiling, in a relatively dim room. Well, that tells me a lot. She tries to sit up, very slowly at first. It takes her a few tries due to the pain in her head, but when she's up, she realizes she's in a bedroom. In the dim light she can tell that the walls are painted a very pale green, sort of a minty color, with a polished wooden floor. There's a bathroom directly in front of the bed, perhaps three yards away, with a closet to its right. An oak dresser occupies the upper right corner, and a door (she assumes it's the way out of the room) stands not far from it. Fresh sheets. She muses, discovering the source of the detergent smell. But where... She lifts her right arm, pressing her nose to the delicate skin. I...The soapy smell is coming from me. That means... Her stomach plummets. Did Archy...Did he... Her hands rush to the sides of her neck, smoothing down the length of her shoulders. No bra...No bra! He undressed me...and bathed me...and then dressed me again. Bollocks! Her head instantly begins to ache more. Wait...how did I end up in bed? I was out somewhere. I was- She gasps. Dad's funeral! What happened? She throws the sheets from her body, revealing her black tank-top and sweat pants as she makes a run for the door. Hold on... After securing a bra, she retraces her steps. Her eyes are assaulted with bright light from the living room when she throws the door open, making her swing her arms before her face, almost whimpering with pain. She waits for the throbbing to subside before continuing, trying to recall where the kitchen is. She's not thrown by the lights this time, but rather from the fact that there's a woman sitting at the dinner table with Archy, across from him. She pauses in the doorway for a moment, watching the two, unsure of her next move. Archy makes it for her, motioning her to the table before she can sneak off to an unseen vantage point. He stands, pulling a chair out for her while Turbo fetches a glass of water. \"What happened?\" She asks. Archy barely has time to sit down before she does so, making him hover for a moment over his seat. He eases the rest of the way down with a groan, leaning heavily on one elbow. \"You got a little excited,\" He says calmly, \"Very anxious-\" \"I fainted?\" She cuts in. \"At my father's funeral?\" \"Panic attack.\" The woman states. \"You were hyperventilating.\" \"I know what a panic attack is.\" Abby says quietly. My head... Her eyes squeeze shut, fingers massaging her temples. She stares at the glass of water when Turbo sets it before her (before scurrying off to a different room), eyeballing it but not making a move to go near it. \"You should drink it; The water will help your headache.\" \"Abby, this is Lizzie. She's a doctor.\" Lizzie looks to be somewhere in her mid-thirties, tall, blonde haired. Her gentle eyes are a special sort of blue, almost turquoise due to the light. She smiles softly, offers her right hand. \"Hello, Abby.\" She studies the hand for a moment. Long, but smooth fingers, attached to unblemished knuckles. She fits her own hand into Lizzie's. No blisters. Never worked a hard day in her life. \"How is this glass of water going to help me?\" \"I imagine you haven't had much to eat or drink...at all, right?\" \"Mhm.\" \"You're dehydrated, therefore your brain isn't functioning properly. This makes it work harder than it has to, and it's a painful process. It can also have an effect on your kidneys...backed up toxins, so on.\" \"I've researched that a lot of physical illnesses are caused by mental stress.\" She pops off, reaching for the glass. Mmm...my throat was more parched than I thought. Archy narrows his eyes subtly, giving off the appearance of fatigue rather than suspicion. Don't think I didn't catch that hint of sarcasm. Lizzie nods approval. \"That's very true. A combination of the two can be withering.\" She takes a few more gulps, squeezing her eyes shut; She's thinking more on the logical side, now. Her headache increases two notches up on the pain scale. The glass is half empty when she sets it back down. Just like my life, except one-fourth short. \"You have no idea.\" She whispers under her breath. She begins to fall into her old routine of silence, keeping to herself and her thoughts. After a moment she leans on her elbow, chin cradled in her palm. \"What time is it?\" She asks no one in particular. Archy glances at his watch. \"Five o'clock.\" I was out for three hours? \"Did I hit my head?\" \"No. Lizzie managed to catch you before that happened.\" \"Then why-...\" She glances at Lizzie. \"Archy told me you've had a rough week. Your body was catching up for lost rest.\" Abby pinches the bridge of her nose in response. Lizzie smiles sympathetically. \"As a doctor, I suggest you lay down as much as possible. Take the water with you. Don't feel bad about just laying around for a few days, hm?\" She looks at Lizzie again; She can see the knowledge in her eyes, practically spilling with brilliance as she gazes steadily at her. She looks at Archy, his fingers now intwined, pressed against his lips. She notices the bags beneath his eyes for the first time, the black circles. His eyes are practically red with irritation. He looks like he's about to drop, but he looks back at her with just as steady a gaze as hers. Lizzie follows her line of sight, chuckles softly through her nose. \"I would tell you to do the same thing, if I didn't know you wouldn't follow my advice.\" His brows creese slightly, but he says nothing. Abby can feel the air getting thicker from her position between them. She grabs the glass of water, nodding to them. \"I believe I'll take your advice, Miss...Elizabeth. I wish we could have met on better terms.\" She smiles, lightly. Archy nods as she walks by. The two drag their gazes to one another once Abby's out of the room. \"I've always respected your opinion.\" He mumbles against his fingers. Lizzie blinks, slowly. \"I didn't say you didn't respect it. I implied that you didn't follow it very often.\" He just nods. He's too tired to disagree. They stare again, measuring each other up. He hasn't changed much since she saw him last...one year ago. His hair has lightened, turned gray in a few synchronized areas, and he's gained a few more lines on his face, but he still looks the same. She hasn't changed a bit. Her eyes still sparkle, her hair still shines with the same golden brilliance. She's gained a little weight, but it doesn't matter to him. She tilts her chin up a little, strums her fingernails on the table. \"Are we back to this again, Arch?\" Her voice is almost a whisper, the pain evident. \"Just staring at each other? There isn't a bullet-proof shield of glass between us.\" Archy shifts his weight, swallows heavily. \"I don't know what you mean.\" \"You know perfectly well what I mean.\" Her tone retains the same softness, but she knows he can hear a difference. He's always been able to pick up on her subtleties. He shifts again, then stands. When he returns, he has two glasses of whisky in his hands. \"You know how I feel.\" His voice is nearly a whisper. He downs half the glass in one take, wincing, yet embracing the burn at the same time. Lizzie sips delicately, as she always has. \"The same applies to you.\" As though he didn't hear her, he doesn't respond. He raises the glass again, polishing it off. Lizzie sighs, pushing her glass toward him. \"You can finish mine, as usual.\" Then stands to leave. \"I would appreciate your help...with Abby.\" He says to her back. \"...Please.\" She pauses, glances at him sideways. \"You still have my number?\" He nods with his eyes closed. \"If it's the same one.\" She turns to leave again, stopping with her hand on the doorknob. \"I'll always be available...for you, Arch.\" To be continued. Feedback is much appreciated.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I do not own anything pertaining to RocknRolla, save for the characters that are not original to the movie. The sun is shining, and quite inexplicably, this irritates Abby. How can the world be so bright...when she still feels like she's in a downpour? She sits up and swings her legs over the edge of the bed, feet feeling more like cinderblocks than a few pounds of flesh and bone. Her head swims with the abrupt motion, making her upper body sway like Goliath...She even falls mightily when she tries to stand up, knocking her chin on the polished wooden floor. Right about now is when I decide it's best to just stay in bed. But she's been in bed since Lizzie suggested she not feel bad about laying around for a few days...approximately four days ago. She rolls over on her back as multi-colored rods of light shoot across her vision, head beginning to throb. The sunlight, which on a normal day she would find pleasant, makes her eyes clamp shut in a sort of pain that one can only feel when they have a headache. She waits for it to subside before sitting up, legs sprawled out and pajama legs jacked up to her knees. Today's a school day, she thinks gloomily. But, it's already an hour past the time classes start. That's not too bad. I could just be absent for three classes, and be there for the rest of the day. She gets to her feet with a groan, deciding not to look in the mirror until she needs to brush her hair. She flips the radio on as she makes her way to the bathroom, determinedly not looking at the mirror while reaching for the blue and white toothbrush next to the sink. \"And today, it looks like it's going to be a pleasant 21*C in the London area, partly cloudy with a 30% chance of rain. Now, on to our music selection! Here are The Pretty Reckless with \"Make Me Wanna Die\"...\" She turns the radio off before the piece can get to the fourth note, resumes brushing her teeth. If she listens to the lyrics, there's no guarantee she won't cry. It scares her how much she agrees with just the title of the song alone. Need she put herself through the torment of listening to it all the way through? Even partly? She dresses in all black, from her skivvies to the wristband she uses to cover the five day old cuts in her left wrist. She decides on a black tank-top with a loose track jacket, semi-baggy cargo pants, and yes, black Chucks. Eventually, she gets up the courage to look in the mirror for hair grooming. Her eyes are wholly bloodshot, green irises dull, pupils empty. This is what she was trying to avoid...seeing the slow death of herself. She swallows hard and tries not to look at her face anymore, focusing on the mess of blonde hair, taming it, and pulling it back into a low ponytail. Archy is sitting at the table in the kitchen when she finds him, reading the newspaper. He lowers it at the sound of her footsteps, offering a subtle smile. \"Morning...Feeling better?\" Abby swallows, throat already dry at the thought of human interaction. \"Uhm...I could eat.\" Her voice is hoarse, a timid whisper. She takes a seat across from him. Good sign. He folds the paper in half, now, drapes it across his lap while he looks in the direction of the kitchen. \"Mrs. Peters, could we get another plate for Abby?\" \"Be right there, Arch.\" The voice drifts sweetly from an area in the kitchen that Abby can't see. It's Cockney, like Archy's, but somehow a little smoother, like someone spread a light layer of syrup over it. \"Would you like some coffee? Tea?\" Archy offers. She glances side-long at him, tilting her head. \"Coffee, please.\" He nods. \"Mrs. Peters-\" \"I heard, I heard.\" Much like Abby had envisioned, the voice belongs to an older lady, somewhere in her late fifties. Her face is round, body stout. Her hair has grayed from age, more so than Archy's, and her eyes are striking blue for how old she is. She flashes Abby a bright smile, placing gently a plate full of eggs, toast, and sliced ham before her. \"There you are, dear. Do you like anything in your coffee?\" She already likes this Ms. Peters, for some reason or other. Perhaps it's her kind older face, or her grandmother attitude. She doesn't know, and doesn't care to know; this lady has already made her feel that the world isn't as dim as she thought. \"Milk and sugar, please.\" Mrs. Peters looks over at Archy with mock surprise, brows raising playfully as she turns toward the kitchen again. \"Milk and sugar, please! So polite! She can't have come from your lot, Arch!\" Abby cocks her brows. Archy allows for a soft snort, nothing more as the newspaper is unfolded again. \"What are you doing today?\" She takes a hefty bite of eggs, cutting away at the ham while she chews; It's like she's realized she hasn't eaten in four days, and the hunger is eating away at her from the inside out; she has to cram her mouth to stop this invisible cannibal. The paper lowers again. \"I've got to go back to work...unfortunately.\" His head tilts, brows furrowed. \"Why?\" She shakes her head, cramming both toast and ham into her cheek. \"Jus' wond'rin'.\" She says with her mouth full. He stares at her for a moment, looks down at his watch. \"Isn't today a school day?\" Mrs. Peters places the coffee before Abby, and before she can warn her of how hot it is, she's already gulped down half the cup. She shares a glance with Archy, disappearing into the kitchen yet again. \"Yes, sir.\" He tilts his head, eyes a little brighter, that subtle smile tickling his lips again. Well, didn't baby brother do good with this one? \"Come now. You don't have to call me sir .\" He tisks. She looks down at her plate sheepishly, poking at another piece of ham. \"What about Uncle ?\" \" Uncle will do nicely.\" He smiles, even though she's not looking at him any more. He must admit, his brother has done nicely; he's already beginning to like this, very much. He watches her for a moment, impressed with the speed with which the food is disappearing. He begins to tell her to slow down, but Mrs. Peters beats him to it, scolding her gently as she refills her coffee. \"There's more where that came from, luv. I'll not have you choking at my table.\" She jumps, startled, giving each of them a chagrined expression, burying part of her face in her coffee. \"It's alright, Mrs. Peters, she hasn't eaten in a while.\" He finds Abby's expression endearing, for some reason. He hardly ever saw Richie with a look of embarrassment on his features. That's it. He decides. She's practically a carbon copy of him. I'll be seeing a lot more of him in this one...More than I saw in the man himself. \"That may be,\" Mrs. Peters starts, \"But it's still no excuse.\" Back to the kitchen. Archy chuckles. \"That's Mrs. Peters for you. Don't mind it...she's always like that.\" She shoves the remainder of the ham in her mouth as a response, washing it down with more coffee. \"When do you plan on going back to school?\" The question stumps her. She eases her silverware in the middle of the plate as she looks up at him, wincing at the slight clinking sound they make. \"I don't know.\" She sighs. He reaches for his coffee, sipping delicately. \"Don't miss too many days, alright?\" His voice is serious, despite the way his eyes continue to smile. \"You don't want them to kick you out.\" \"Okay.\" She yawns. She cocks her head after a moment, brows furrowing. \"Uncle, what do you for a living?\" Her expression doesn't show it, but she inwardly kicks herself. Don't sound like such a child. Archy pauses for a moment, easing his coffee cup back down to the saucer. He folds the newspaper in half as he thinks up an answer, setting the paper on the table. \"I work for a very successful businessman.\" He crosses his right leg over the left, folding his hands in his lap. \"What kind of businessman?\" Inquisitive, are we? \"Real-estate.\" It's not a complete lie. Lenny buys and sells land, buildings, so on. He just left out the part about crayfish...and garrotes...and hand guns. He tilts his head in turn, making an attempt to shift the attention from himself. \"What did Richie do for a living? Same thing five years ago?\" \"Mhm. Small-time insurance salesman. He repaired computers on the side, when he had time.\" Insurance. Computers? Would anyone kill him over those things? \"Do you remember what he was doing the day he...passed?\" Abby takes in a deep breath, lets it out slowly. It's too early for this. \"As far as I know, he was working late at his insurance job. I called the police when he wasn't home by midnight. He...wasn't answering his mobile, and I got worried. He'd always call and let me know if he was going to have to pull an all-nighter.\" Archy takes all this in accordingly, thinking it all through and filing it away in that special cabinet at the back of his brain. \"Did your father have any enemies?\" Her eyes clamp shut, breaths coming a little shallow. \"I don't know why he would. He was so good at making friends.\" \"Do you think he may have had a disgruntled insurance customer?\" \"Uncle Archy.\" She says quickly. He blinks, noting her uneven breathing, her clamped eyes, fingers massaging her temples, adding them up. \"I'm sorry.\" She says quietly. He shakes his head. \"Don't be, don't be. I'm sorry. It's too soon.\" \"Yes.\" She nods. \"Thank you. I want to help, really. I just...\" She sighs. \"I know.\" He assures. \"I understand.\" The soothing tone in his voice hides the awkward feelings that begin to build up in his thoughts. You've just made her emotional again. Good job. He almost thanks any form of deity he can think of when his mobile begins to chirp, turning his head to the side as he presses it to his ear. \"It's Archy.\" \"Archy. I have some business I need to take care of.\" \"Alright, Len. Where do you want me?\" \"The warehouse, and hurry up.\" \"On my way.\" He closes his mobile, opening his arms simultaneously. \"That's the boss.\" \"Okay.\" She says quietly. He finishes off his coffee, stretches when he stands. \"Are you going to stay here all day?\" She shrugs. \"I don't know. I might go to the library later...Is that alright?\" A nod. \"That's fine. Do what you want...Just stay out of trouble, you hear me?\" He shoves his hands in his pockets, giving her a side-glance. She snorts unenthusiastically. \"Don't worry about it.\" Mrs. Peters enters the room again, this time from a different angle. She doesn't see the confused expression coming from Abby, seeming to ask, When did you leave the kitchen? She helps Archy put on his trench coat, slipping it up his arms and over his shoulders. She even goes to the extent of coming around in front of him to straighten it, patting the side of his face before pointing a stern finger. \"Please be careful, Arch.\" Archy rolls his eyes, sighs impatiently. \"Mrs. Peters-\" \"I mean it, Archy. Stay away from those abandoned lots.\" He smirks, takes a step back to put a little more distance between them. \"Ah, but that's where the highest profits are, Mrs. Peters.\" Mrs. Peters scoffs, looks at Abby. \"He'll never learn, this one. Always running for the best profit. Never mind his own health!\" Archy shakes his head. \"Mrs. Peters's room is just down the hallway from yours-\" \"I'll be cleaning all day, and I'll need to go to market.\" \"Alright, alright.\" He waves a hand dismissively. \"She's got my number, and Lizzie's, if you find you need anything outside of Mrs. Peters's help.\" Abby just nods, crossing right leg over left, folding her hands in her lap. Archy, Mrs. Peters, and even Turbo (having just walked in), all stare at her. She looks exactly like Archy, same posture, same neutral stare, all in a female body. She even uses the same tone when she asks them, \"What's the matter?\" Archy shakes his head...again. \"Nothing. I'm off,\" And turns quickly on his heel, Turbo following suit. Mrs. Peters motions to the empty plate and coffee cup. \"A-...All done there, luv?\" \"Is something wrong, Mrs. Peters? Have I done something?\" \"No, no.\" She says quickly. \"You've done nothing wrong, it's alright. We've all just got a lot to do, you see. Everything has just sort of...been on hold for a few days.\" She furrows her brows. \"Mrs. Peters, has everyone been waiting for me to get well? Is that what the looks were all about?\" Mrs. Peters blinks. \"Looks? What looks?\" Abby leans forward a little in her chair, sticking her chin out just a little. \"Everyone was staring at me...I was wondering what it was about.\" She pauses, dishes in hand, before smiling abruptly (a bit skittishly, in Abby's opinion). \"It's just nonsense, dear. We're not used to having something so pretty around the house, is all. Don't worry your little blonde head about it.\" She disappears into the kitchen, dishes clinking loudly. Okay. That wasn't odd in the least. She sits up in her chair, decides to stand. \"Oh, Mrs. Peters?\" Her head whips around the corner, eyes slightly bewildered. \"Yes, ducky?\" \"Archy mentioned that you have his...I'm guessing...mobile number? Lizzie's too. Could I have those? I just want to have them if I decide to go out. You have a mobile too, right? I might need your number as well...You know, just for safety.\" Mrs. Peters stares at her, expression blank, as though she can't comprehend anything the teen is saying. She snaps straight up without warning, posture ram-rod straight. \"Oh! Of course, luv, of course! Let me get those for you.\" Abby stares at the place the woman had been standing not seconds ago, almost wanting to scratch her head in contemplation. Is something wrong with me? \"I'll ask you one more time. If you give me the correct answer, I'll send you back home safe and sound, in a clean set of clothes. If it's the wrong answer,\" Lenny motions to a burly man in the corner, red-haired, hands cradling a semi-automatic shotgun, \"Roger, over there, will be taking care of you, instead. Now,\" He looks over the rims of his shades at the beefy group of men surrounding the dark haired man, nodding to them. \"Gentleman.\" Archy watches from the side, weight leaned on his hand against the little table shoved against the wall. The men don't waste any time, some automatically rearing back their legs to plant their feet in the unfortunate fellow's gut. One lifts him up off the ground, holding him against the wall by the neck, while another hammers his nose and mouth with his fist, sending a small spatter of blood across the brick wall. Lenny reaches for the whistling tea kettle next to the table, cup and saucer in hand. \"Something wrong, Arch?\" Archy blinks, slowly bringing his gaze to the sunglasses. \"No, no. Sorry. 'Bit distracted, is all...Just thinking.\" Lenny adds cream and sugar to his steaming tea, nodding. \"Sorry about your brother, Arch. I apologize for not making it to the funeral.\" \"No, it's alright. Things- \" His gaze reverts to the man being beaten, now on the floor in fetal position. \"Come up.\" \"Was that the last of your family, then?\" \"Biological? No.\" That subtle Archy-smile begins to tickle his lips. He fights the urge, looking back at the man...now not moving. \"He's still very much alive in his daughter.\" The tea cup stops mid-way to Lenny's lips, eyes sliding across the table and up to Archy's face, before he turns his head. \"He had a daughter?\" Archy turns his head quickly, surprised at Lenny's sudden interest. \"Yeah. Sixteen. Awfully quiet. Very shy.\" He snorts. \"Inquisitive little thing.\" Lenny stands quietly, nodding. \"Daughter.\" He mumbles. \"Oi! Gentleman! Don't kill the man!\" He turns back to Archy, small smile plastered onto his lips. \"Well, I'll have to meet this young lady, won't I?\" What's this about, then? \"Yeah, alright. We can have you over for dinner. Mrs. Peters has been asking about you. It'll be...interesting, yeah?\" He chuckles. Oh, this will be very interesting. Very interesting, indeed. He nods, walking to the bloodied man on the floor as he sips his tea. To be continued...Feedback would be appreciated. You know what I dislike? When people favorite my stories, but they don't review. If they favorite a story, there's obviously something they like about that story, and they obviously have good things to say about it, right? I really do appreciate feedback. It doesn't have to be a grand paragraph. It could just be how much you enjoy it, or constructive criticism, or whatever you wish to say. I'm flattered by you who have favorited my story. Could you flatter me more with a comment? A pointer? Even something you hate about the writing! I will STILL appreciate your comment! Thank you. :)[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not own anything pertaining to RocknRolla, save for the characters that are not original to the film. It's a nice pub, not boisterous, not so chatty that people sitting directly across from one another have to shout so that the other can hear. Situated in a little corner in Piccadilly, it gives the diner (or drinker) the illusion of privacy, despite being a very public place. The interior is splashed with color, the multi-toned carpets filled with reds and blues, the walls concrete with a sporadic paint pattern (paint thrown directly from the cans to the walls). Abby likes it, the array. It reminds her of candy, each color representing a different flavor. It reflects the attitudes of the people that come in, as well, people with an inspiration for art, or musicians playing out a beat with anything within reach. Even the tables have a personality, scenes from movies, books, or paintings printed right onto the tables and covered with a glass blanket. Abby sits back, allowing the atmosphere to flow around her, through her, inside of her. She sips lightly at her beer, glancing at her lunch buddy. \"How long have you known my uncle, then?\" Lizzie also goes at her own beverage, a light wine. \"About ten years. Your father introduced us not long after your mother passed.\" She tilts her head back, brows knitting. \"My father introduced you?\" A young man wearing a white button-down and a black apron approaches the table, grinning as he deposits a plate before each female. He pays particular attention to Abby, ensuring that he makes more eye contact with her than Lizzie. \"Ladies.\" He says, still staring at said person. \"Enjoy your meal.\" Lizzie waits for him to walk away before raising her brows at Abby. \"You should get his number when we're done here.\" Abby snorts, pops a chip in her mouth. \"Nah. I'm not interested in boys right now. Pursuing them so quickly after my father's death would feel like stabbing him in the back.\" She takes a sip of beer, pops another chip in her mouth, then a piece of fish. Lizzie stares at her for a moment, raising her fork and knife to check the center of her steak. \"Don't you think your father would want you to be happy, Abby?\" She nods her head, several times, reaching for the beer again. \"Yeah.\" Her hands turn over, gesturing with her palms as her brows arch again. \"Well?\" Another bite of fish. \"No,\" She shakes her head, \"I couldn't do it. I can't focus on guys right now...I don't want to. First I need to stop mourning, and I need to get back into school, and my marks. When I'm back on my feet again,\" She gestures in the direction of the waiter with her head, \"Maybe I'll do something about a boyfriend. Now,\" Her eyes light up (but only slightly) with enthusiasm, her weight shifted forward. \"Tell me about you, dad and Archy. How did you come across them?\" She takes a sip of wine, a bite of bread. \"I bought insurance from your dad.\" She smiles. \"He was a good salesman, really seemed to care about his clients. Not some fake, \"Oh, we care about you\", no. He seemed genuinely interested in what was going on in my life.\" Abby grins. \"That's dad, alright. He understood people, always enjoyed each person's unique personality.\" Lizzie smiles, takes a bite of salad. \"Mhm. He noticed how sad I seemed to be that day. My boyfriend had broken up with me the week before...I was heartbroken. There was supposed to be some party for your dad...I think it was for his birthday. He said he could introduce me to a few...\"blokes\", as he put it. Archy was one of them, and I happened to like him the most.\" She closes her eyes, a peaceful sort of smile caressing her lips as she seems to savor the bit of information. After a moment, she allows a sigh to flow quietly over her teeth, and her eyes open half-way, like she's in some sort of bliss. \"It feels so good to talk about him.\" Her brows slant. \"You know? Archy's been walking around on egg shells...People avoid the topic, when really, it's what you need to talk about.\" Her partner nods, polishing off a large chunk of the steak. \"Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Archy'll figure it out soon enough, just give him some time. He's wrestling with grief too, you know? As far as brothers go, they were very close.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" She murmurs. \"If they were so close, why hadn't they seen each other in so long?\" Lizzie remains still for a moment, sighs. \"Prison changed a lot of things about Archy.\" Her brows knit. \"Like what?\" \"Well,\" She starts quietly. \"For one, he wasn't so apt to showing his feelings when he got out...It desensitized him. You can't show too many emotions when you're in prison, Abby; inmates will use anything they can against you.\" She snorts. \"Archy didn't even like me coming to the compound...Didn't like the way even the guards looked at me. Two,\" She takes a hefty gulp of wine. \"It ate away at his patience. He doesn't beat around the bush, and he doesn't expect you too, either. He was on a strict schedule for four years. On that schedule, wasting time is a punishable act. If you waste Archy's time, he'll be sure to punish you in some way or another. \"Three,\" Here, she pauses. The sparkle in her eyes tones down a bit, solemnity darkening the turquoise to a deep blue. Her breaths come in shallower, oozing streams as her fingertips play delicately at the stem of her wineglass, gaze penetrating the liquid, absorbing it...looking right through it. She looks back up at Abby, suddenly, and shakes her head, forcing a smile. \"He's got past it all now, though, hasn't he?\" Once again, Abby's brows furrow. Her thumb and forefinger had been playing with her bottom lip, pulling on it, rolling it between her prints. They stop, allowing it to snap back to her gums like a rubber-band. \"Wait,\" She sits up a little straighter, \"What's number three?\" Lizzie goes for the wine again, this time a little slower, and sighs into her glass. \"We just got into a lot of rows, that's all. Part of the loss of patience.\" Abby stares at her. Then, very slowly, leans slightly over the table, weight resting heavily on the elbows. She looks her straight in the eyes, murmurs, \"Did he hit you?\" She gasps, shaking her head rapidly. \"No! Heavens no! Archy isn't that type, not anywhere near it!\" Now she, too, leans across the table, until her nose is only a few inches from her friend's. \"You listen to me, and you listen good. Archy will never, ever hit you because he's angry with you. He may hit one of his mates, yeah, but never you.\" Abby tilts her head to the left. \"Why is that, then?\" \"Because you're a woman. He won't hit you unless it's an extreme circumstance. He's got strong shoulders, Abby; Archy can take an insult. He can take gossip and lies being spread around about him, he can take name calling. Hell, you could probably deck him in the chest a few times, but he won't hit back.\" She stares at her, long and hard. Eventually, she shakes her head, leans back into her chair. \"You're lying to me.\" Blink. \"I beg your pardon?\" She takes in a deep breath, lets it out slowly. \"He hit you. There's a very obvious pain in your eyes when you talk about this subject.\" Maybe she's imagining it, but Lizzie's eyes seem to grow even darker...this time in a more threatening way. \"You watch who you call a liar, Abby.\" Her voice is low, but she may as well be shouting with the amount of menace she put into her tone. \"He never hit me, and he'll never hit you. Do you know what he did when I hit him?\" She allows a heavy silence to stand for effect. \"He hugged me.\" Dumbness. That's what she's reduced to. She blinks, several times, staring stupidly. Finally, she remembers to breathe. \" You hit him ?\" Lizzie leans back, reaching for a cigarette. \"He had it coming.\" She gestures with her palms, bending the fingers a few times. \"Well? Come on, then. Why did you hit him? Where?\" Large, large inhalation of smoke. She lays her left arm atop her stomach, resting her elbow on the wrist, cigarette dangling just a few inches from the lips. \"We were having a row.\" A puff of smoke comes out with each word. \"It had been a hard couple of months. He was losing me, and he knew it. I was just so... irritated with him at that point.\" \"Why?\" \"I was upset with the changes that prison had inflicted on him, and I was letting him know it. He was trying to reason...I wasn't. I was beyond reason at that point. It was just...rage, and emotions on my part. I got so angry that I just started to strike his chest, over and over again.\" She pauses for a moment to glance at Abby. \"There was nothing to throw, you see. So,\" She looks away again, focusing on one of the paint splotches on the wall. \"I hit him.\" She snorts, shakes her head. \"And Archy...He just stood there and took it.\" Like a knight...My dark knight in smudged black armour. \"I guess it was starting to hurt him,\" Not near as much as it did mentally . \"Because, he reached up and grabbed my wrists...not even very hard, and silently soothed me into stopping. That's when he hugged me. He pulled me by the wrists toward him, and wrapped his arms around me. I tried to shove him off, naturally, but he wouldn't let go. He just stood there, like always, and rubbed my back until I calmed down. He tried to reason again; I could tell he was hurt. He was throwing out reasons we should stay together...I was throwing out reasons why we should break up. It all ended that night.\" Just like my life. \"I packed my things and moved out. It's been a year.\" Feels like it's been ten. Abby sits quietly, the remainders of her fish and beer forgotten. She breathes in, timidly, before speaking. \"You seemed alright a few days ago. You were speaking fine, I thought, until the tail-end of the conversation.\" Lizzie takes another puff off the cigarette, half wasted while she'd been speaking. \"It's not the first time we've seen each other...It's the most we've spoken, though. We'll see what happens.\" She offers a smile...genuinely. Abby offers her own little smile, remembering her beer. \"It's gonna be alright.\" She takes a gulp, grins. Her brows arch, eyes starting to sparkle. \"Oh, yeah? Why do you think that?\" She shakes her head, taking another gulp. \"It's just a hunch.\" \"Have you got everything you need?\" Mrs. Peters stands over the black stove in the kitchen, panhandle in one hand, wooden spoon in the other. She stirs a white sauce, one of her own recipe, for tonight's dinner. She briefly pauses, only long enough to send a glare over her shoulder. \"Yes, Archy, for the third time. You know the rules: Either help me while I'm cooking, or get out of the kitchen.\" Oh, yes, he knows those rules, quite well, in fact. He only lingers every now and then to annoy her. He finds it delightful to push her buttons once in a while, finally able to release a bit of his crude humor on someone who will actually appreciate it, even if she doesn't show it. His brows arch, eyes sparkling with amusement as the corners of his lips pull back, just enough to reveal a peak at his crooked front tooth. \"Alright, alright. No need to get agitated. I'm leaving.\" He doesn't leave, however. He creeps up behind Mrs. Peters, just close enough for the inside of his arm to brush her shoulder as he reaches to coat his fingertip with sauce. Mrs. Peters is quick, however, having raised three boys of her own in her younger years. She whirls on him, smacking the top of his hand with the spoon, managing to successfully whack his wrist against the hot edge of the pan. Archy jerks his hand back with a slight yelp, the playful spark still in his eyes despite the singeing pain. He sucks the sauce from the top of his hand while the other massages the burn. Mrs. Peters tisks, depositing the spoon in the sauce so she can place her fists on her hips. \"You scatterbrained git! That's what you deserve! Trying to grab a taste of the works while they're still in the making. I told you, if you're not helping, you're just in my way!\" She bends around the corner, motioning to Abby. \"Darling, would you come stir the sauce, please, so it won't burn?\" She turns back to Archy, shaking her head again. \"Come here, you silly cheek.\" Abby watches with great amusement as Mrs. Peters leads Archy to the sink, rubbing his burn with soap before putting it under the tap. She shakes her head, grabs the spoon. \"Is it always like this?\" Both adults turn their heads, Mrs. Peters now rubbing the wound with light little circles. \"What? Archy behaving like an insolent child? Yes, it occurs every other dinner.\" The doorbell rings. She glances nervously at Archy, then at the door. \"That can't be him already, can it? Dinner isn't for a good half hour.\" Archy shakes his head. \"I don't know. It shouldn't be...Not this early.\" \"Oh, I invited Lizzie.\" Abby says casually. At both adult's silence, she adds, \"I...hope that's okay?\" Mrs. Peters is quick to answer...too quick. \"Ah, well, that's fine, dear! The darling woman hasn't had a decent meal with us in ages.\" She glances at Archy, then his wound. \"And who's fault is that, now?\" Just for emphasis (or is it fun?) she applies a little too much pressure to Archy's wrist. Unable to pull away, his knees bend, bringing him down a few feet to Mrs. Peters's height while the other hand grips the edge of the sink. \"Bloody hell!\" She arches her brows, releasing his hand. \"Oh. Did I apply too much pressure? Sorry, luv. I'll know better next time.\" She bustles off from the kitchen, drying her hands on her apron as she goes to answer the door. Abby looks apologetically (somewhat fearfully) at Archy, toning the heat down on the stove. \"Sorry, Uncle. I didn't think you would mind if I brought a guest.\" She looks so fragile. Why is she so timid again? \"It's fine, Abbs. Just for future reference, though, let us know sooner, alright?\" He smiles, briefly, moving to dry his hands on the towel dangling just a few inches from Abby's thigh. He pauses when she flinches, knitting his brows as he tugs it off the handle of the oven door. \"You alright?\" She nods. \"Yeah. I zoned out for a second...You startled me.\" They're interrupted by two sets of footsteps coming toward them, one heavy, one light. A moment later, Mrs. Peters reenters the kitchen, a one Miss Elizabeth Silverberry in tow. Abby smiles, happy to see her new friend, despite having seen her only a few hours prior. Archy finds that he can only stare, for now. She's wearing her little black dress with the short black heels...his favorites on her. He finally manages a nod, a civil greeting, before he's shooed out of the kitchen to wait in the living room. A long, heavy sigh hisses past his teeth as he drops himself down on the couch. He notes with no particular pleasure the popping sounds coming from his joints, the slight ache in his lower back. I'm getting old...too old. He thinks, a slight bitterness to his inner voice. Lizzie doesn't seem to think so. Something responds. True. She seemed to hold the same light for him a few days ago. But why? He leans his head back, allowing it to sink against the cushion. A good twelve years separates them. It's not the first time he's thought about this. He would bring it up to her every now and then, when he'd hit an uncharacteristic low of self-confidence. All she would say in reply was, \"Love has no boundaries.\" He would only swallow and stare at her, and she would find ways to prove her statement. His eyes glaze over as he thinks about those times...any of the times they had been together , before shaking his head. Another time. The couch shifts. It's only a light shift, but enough to alert him to someone else's presence. He opens his eyes, allows his head to loll in the direction of the other being. Turquoise eyes stare back. \"Hello.\" Suddenly, he finds that his oxygen supply has been cut off. All of those images rush to his head when he looks at her, and he finds that all he can do is stare in response. He coughs a few times, trying to remember how to breathe. \"Lizzie.\" He says weakly. Her eyes open up a little more as her brows slant, head tilting toward the cushion. \"Are you alright?\" He nods...a little too vigorously. \"Yeah, yeah.\" Silence. An awkward silence. Not just for Archy, but both parties. Lizzie crosses one wrist over the other, drumming her fingertips on her left knee. Nothing is coming to mind, nothing that isn't bland. She attempts to stare back, going with the most dull small-talk question that comes to her tongue first. \"How is work?\" Archy ponders this question for a moment. When was the last time someone had asked him about work? Long ago, he guesses, because he can't remember. Everyone he knows (excluding Abby) has knowledge of what he does for a living, therefore, no questions are ever asked. \"Are you still in the same line of work?\" She asks quietly. He nods once, crossing right leg over left, folding his hands in his lap in his classic \"Archy-posture\". \"Yeah, I still work for Lenny.\" He dissects her expression, her relaxed body language. Lizzie has never liked his job, which has always puzzled him about her feelings. He continues, finding no trace of disapproval. \"It's been alright...Nothing major. Lenny's actually eating with us tonight.\" Her expression remains neutral. \"I see.\" He chews on the corner of his bottom lip, glancing at the clock on the wall opposite them, then back. \"Abby helping Mrs. Peters, then?\" A tiny smile tugs at the corners of her lips. \"Mhm. She seems very eager to help...She seems very eager in general.\" She pauses, giving him a side-long gaze. \"She's very intelligent, Arch. Extremely polite...Doesn't take much to put her in her place-\" \"Did she give you any trouble?\" \"No. I had to correct her during a small fragment of the conversation during lunch, but it didn't give me any trouble. She's a good listener, picks up on little things. You shouldn't have any problems keeping her.\" He nods again. \"Good, good. What did you have to correct her over?\" She holds her breath for a moment. \"She called me out on something. It was just a misinterpretation, no big deal.\" Another pause. \"Archy, did you ever find out if she's-\" The doorbell rings. Archy gives her an apologetic expression before standing. \"Hold that thought.\" \"Ello, Arch. Not too early, I hope?\" Lenny's smile is warm, a rarity in his line of work. He holds out a dark bottle with a red label, allowing himself inside when Archy opens the door a bit wider. \"Thought you might enjoy a bit of this.\" Archy smiles, cradling the gift lightly in his elongated fingers. \"That's quite kind, thank you.\" Lizzie, not wanting to be rude, is the next to approach, holding her hand out with her classic \"business-smile\". She ignores Archy's smirk (the only man that can tell it's fake), and shakes Lenny's hand. \"Mr. Cole, I haven't seen you in some time.\" Lenny grasps her hand without hesitation, eyes darkening a little as he kisses her smooth knuckles. \"No need for formalities, Liz. I hope you've been well?\" He continues holding her hand, smiling like a wolf. \"Archy, dinner's on the-\" Mrs. Peters freezes mid-sentence, her eyes lighting up like neons, a grin so happy attacking her lips that it tugs them nearly to her ears. \"Lenny! I haven't seen you in a while!\" She rushes up to him before he can get out a word, hugging him with so much effort it makes him groan. \"Why are you being such a stranger? Where've you been?\" \"Work has been murder, Delilah.\" He wheezes (only Archy catches the irony). He hugs her briefly, prying himself away as soon as she allows. \"Haven't been able to get away from it in quite a while.\" Mrs. Peters laughs, a jolly bellow from the pit of her stomach. It ricochets off the walls, attacking every inhabitant's ears until they ache. \"Oh, I know how that is! Come on, luv! Have a seat! Have a seat!\" She takes his hand, practically dragging him to the table. Archy and Lizzie share a gaze, both chuckling quietly to each other. This is one thing they've definitely missed: Mrs. Peters acting like an absolute child in a sweet shop whenever Lenny's around. \"And who is this young lady? I don't believe I've met you before.\" Abby spins around with a start, not accustomed to being addressed so loudly from behind. Archy smiles at his boss, motioning to Abby with an outstretched arm. \"Len, this is my niece, Abby-\" \"Pleasure to meet you.\" He cuts in. He holds her hand tightly, staring directly in her eyes while he shakes it. \"Lenny Cole.\" She can't quite put her finger on it, but something seems wrong about this guy. His gaze seems to penetrate her pupils, trying to stare into the very depths of her soul, rather than at her. She tries to gently peel her hand out of his, but he's got a vice grip. \"Mr. Cole.\" She says quietly. \"Pleasure to meet you.\" She avoids his eyes, fixing hers instead on a point just above his head. Lenny takes note of this, bends his head sideways and down to get closer to her face. \"Archy's told me all about you. Sorry about your dad...That's quite a shame.\" Now she really doesn't look at him. Pity parties are of the past. Only happy things involving her dad are allowed. She moves her gaze now to his right temple, keeping it on his sideburn. \"Thank you, Mr. Cole.\" He can feel her pulse speeding up between the confines of his fingers and palm. He files this away, too, and finally drops her hand like it had burned him. With that same \"warm\" smile, he turns to the other three adults, motioning to the food-laden table. \"Well, are we just going to stand here?\" \"So, Abby, where do you go to school?\" The question shouldn't make her uncomfortable, but it does. She picks at her food, trying to decide if she should lie or not. If she lies, then Archy might ask questions...or worse, might believe her. If she tells the truth, this creep will know where she is most of the day. Then again, out of hundreds of students, school security the way it is, he wouldn't be able to find me, yeah? Unless he found out about my classes, and where I go afterwards. \"Knightley.\" Lenny tears into a piece of asparagus, taking off half of it in one go. \"Knightley? Not sure I'm familiar with it.\" \"It's not one of London's more renowned schools,\" She says quietly, \"Just a little place near Trafalgar Square. You'd miss it if you weren't looking for it.\" \"What's your favorite class?\" Lizzie asks. Abby stares at her baked chicken, not really looking at it, but thinking, as the ghost of a smile plays at her lips. \"I haven't got a favorite; there are far too many subjects that I enjoy.\" \"Such as?\" \"Art and music, literature, science. I have a tendency to lean more towards art, though.\" Lenny files this information away, thankful that Lizzie has begun to ask the questions; the girl is more comfortable with her, which doesn't really surprise him. He fancies himself as intimidating, enjoys the thought that people (not just females), are submissive to him. Smart people fear him. Stupid people learn quickly from the wages he deals them. He hides a smirk behind his wine glass, looking at Abby studiously. He notes that her eyes remain down cast most of the time, a yielding (or shy?) gesture. She doesn't speak unless someone addresses her, remaining silent and vigilant the rest of the time. She's very intelligent, from what he can gather when she allows her voice to be heard, but she doesn't seem to hold any suspicions for him when he looks at her...only disquiet. If he didn't know any better, he would swear Archy was the father; the green eyes are a dead giveaway of their relations, along with facial structure, the build of their hands and noses. The only things that don't quite match are the blonde hair, ears (must be from her mother), and her speech. She doesn't have the rough Cockney, like her uncle. No, her words are well refined, like someone had gone to lengths to ensure her pronunciations would be smooth, clear...almost have a gentle quality to them. He's brought back to reality when said girl looks timidly his direction, seeming to feel his piercing gaze. He smiles charmingly at her, going at the last piece of chicken and sauce on the plate, along with the final bite of asparagus. He doesn't linger long after dinner. After all, he's got wine aplenty warming his belly, a large dinner behind it. He's not one for sitting around and talking anyway...not unless it's business related. He bids each of them farewell equally (with the exception of Mrs. Peters, having had to peel her off his neck, yet again), and waits until the door is firmly closed behind him before turning to his driver. \"Well?\" Lenny shakes his head. \"No, it doesn't look like it. We'll keep a strong eye on her...just to be certain.\" To Be Continued... Once again, thank you to my reviewers, SelensLegacy, and G.G. Blythe. Please keep it up. :) To everyone that reads but don't review, I appreciate that you stop by...however, a review WOULD be flattering. :D[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I do not own anything pertaining to RocknRolla, aside from characters that are not original to the movie. \"So, tell me about this uncle, then. What's he like?\" Abby walks sullenly down the sidewalk, thoughts deadpan. Normally, she enjoys school. The right to educate herself is one that she very much likes to exercise. Her brain absorbs all the knowledge like a sponge, soaking up each last little detail; little details are the most important, after all. She's classified by all the other students as a nerd, sometimes a kiss-up. But, if she had the clothing and the attitude like that rich kid, she would be that super smart, popular girl (though she'd abhor it completely) that everyone seems to like. She's never seen the profit of being popular, never will. All she's always wanted is the education. Today, however, the knowledge felt empty. The lessons didn't hold her attention the way they usually do. She didn't speak with her teachers whenever she had all the opportunities (and they did notice). She didn't hear the conversations of her friends all around her at the lunch table. She simply existed today, a mere casing of skin holding bones, internal organs, tissue (scar tissue in some areas), cartilage, flesh. She knows she's alive because she can feel her pulse pounding against her throat when she squeezes it too hard, and her lungs begin to burn if she holds her breath for too long. Pain is all she's got to go off of, now. She wonders if her nervous system still works. She looks down at the fingers on her left hand, flexes them in a wave from pinky to pointer. She wiggles her thumb, then follows the palm down to her black bandana-covered wrist. She wonders if it would hurt if she sliced into the skin, through each layer and sublayer. What if she lacerated the cartilage, tore through the thin pad of meat...chipped into the ratio and ulna bones? Would it make her feel like anything more than a walking corpse? It's worth a shot, she decides. A bit of life flutters through her when something jabs her sharply in the ribs. The source is to her left, a young man of the same age. He's tall and lanky, still learning how to coordinate his awkward body. Black hair, squared off in the back and messy in the front, falls down over his left eye, constantly making him sweep it back. His eyes are warm despite their icy arctic blue, which stand shockingly out from under his thick black brows. Charles (known to his friends as Charlie), would also hold the popularity status, were he not such a geek. No one in the school can really get him to talk about anything aside from video games and science for more than five minutes, other than Abby and Jessica. He nods to the other side of Abby with his head, a crooked smile tugging at the right corner of his lips. \"Jess just asked you a question.\" He pokes the top of her head lightly, staring at the shiny strands of blonde with playfully furrowed brows. \"Anyone in there?\" Abby swats his hand away, feigning annoyance. \"I apologize, Jess...my mind was elsewhere.\" Jess is half a head taller, easily making Abby the shortest in the bunch. She always wears her hazelnut hair in a high horsetail, effectively keeping it out of her olive-green eyes. She's the rich, born enemy of the most popular girl in the school. She has the smarts, the wit, and the clothing. However, she's known to the student-body as the \"voice of the nerds\"...the complete opposite of her adversary. \"It's alright. I was just asking about your uncle. What's he like?\" Abby considers, stopping for a moment to study their surroundings, hone in her internal GPS on where they are. She nods to their favorite pub, The Quill , and continues walking. Not until there's a pint in her hand does she respond. \"Mysterious.\" \" Mysterious ?\" Charlie choruses with Jess. She nods, takes a sip. \"Yeah. I mean, I don't know much about him...Not much at all. He claims he works for a successful businessman...in real-estate.\" \" Claims ?\" Jess asks. \"What, you don't believe him?\" She chews on her lower lip, rests her weight on her elbows. \"He just doesn't seem to fit the criteria of real-estate agent . He is charismatic, but...I don't know. He's a big guy, muscular...Seems to know his way around firearms.\" \"Well,\" Jess starts, \"He is a man. They build muscle easily. A lot of them know things about guns, cars and explosions that we could care less about.\" \"Yes, but,\" Abby continues, \"I met his boss a few days ago.\" She makes a face, reaching again for her pint. \"Creeper! Definitely something sleazy about him...and I don't mean that in the salesman type way.\" She shakes her head. \"I trust my uncle, but I get the impression he's not telling me everything.\" \"Well, you are a guest in his home.\" Charlie points out. \"Really? I didn't know.\" Jess snorts. \"I think what Charlie was trying to get at-\" \"I know what Charlie was getting at. I'm a guest in my uncle's home, therefore he's not at liberty to tell me what isn't my business. But, still, something isn't right here.\" She leans back in the booth, whispers to herself as she picks up the pint, \"Something isn't right.\" Despite what was spoken by Abby about the school, he'd been able to find it without delay. He'd also been able to follow them down the street just as easily. The pub isn't too crowded, containing enough people to make him seem insignificant. He's dressed in all black, from his fedora and tie, right down to his socks and shoes. He sits at a table not too far away from the three teens, listening quietly as he sips at his wine. A yellow writing pad rests near his left hand, a pen between his slender fingers. He listens to the teens talk, writes something down every now and then. He smirks a few times, noting their naivety. This will be much easier than he'd first expected. Much, much easier. He waits until the teens finish their drinks and leave, before pulling out his mobile. \"Yeah, it's me.\" He pauses. \"I don't know much yet. She's a smart one. I don't think she's buying Archy's real-estate gig.\" He pauses again. \"I know that she goes to the National Gallery after classes, and then the pub.\" He tilts his head, watching the trio recede down the sidewalk. \"Yes, I'll definitely be keeping an eye on her. Thank you, Mr. Cole.\" Just as cooly, he hangs up, finishing his wine before leaving. He'd known all along that keeping a copy of the key would benefit him. Granted, the man could have moved away, but he knows him; once he finds a place he likes, a place he's comfortable with, he doesn't want to move. He checks the knob first, on the off-chance it isn't locked. It is. The key slides in smoothly, pushing the pins in just the right places, pulling back on the deadbolt when he twists it to the left. The flat is just as he remembers it; not much has changed about it since he was a boy. The floors are still polished and spotless as ever, all the furniture tidy and windows clean. He almost wants to kick his shoes off before proceeding. Almost. However, it's not in his fashion to act in the favor of others. He goes directly to the one room he knows he's always been forbidden to go in, not thinking twice as he goes through the drawers. A smirk tugs at his lips when his gaze comes to rest on a pack of cigarettes, second drawer on the right, bottom left corner atop a folded document. His bony fingers wrap around the pack (reds), stows them away in the left jacket pocket after tucking one behind his ear. He leaves the lighter, choosing instead to quench his curiosity about the document. His brows arch as he drinks brandy straight from the bottle (found previously in the top left drawer), eyes skimming the text, slowly, at first, then again, fervently. Now that...That is very interesting. Date...Date...1995 -\" \"John? Johnny Quid?\" Johnny cranes his neck, stares for a moment at the plump woman standing in the doorway. He takes his feet off the desk, stands from the comfy leather chair with a goofy grin, arms thrown out wide. \"'Ello, Auntie! Time hasn't changed you a bit!\" Mrs. Peters lunges at the document in his left hand, a tiny amount of horror visible in the lines on her face. \"That's Mrs. Peters to you, John. What are you doing here? Why were you looking at this paper?\" She snatches it out of his sticky fingers, folds it back up and holds it tightly against her chest. \"You will not breathe a word about-\" \"Relax. I just came for drugs and booze, Auntie. Whatever Uncle Arch-\" \"Out! Get out of this room!\" She starts shoving him to make her point, not stopping until he's a good five feet from the threshold and the door is locked. \"You have to leave, John. I want you out before Arch comes by for lunch-\" \"You mean he eats, now? How do you manage that? Spoon-feeding?\" \"Johnny-\" \"Alright, alright. I'll leave...As soon as I speak with Uncle Arch.\" \"Why? What for?\" She clutches the document tighter. He stares at her for a moment, then the paper. \"Though that would be an... interesting conversation , Auntie, that's not exactly why I'm here.\" He turns in the direction of the living room, placing himself within short walking distance of the front door. \"Then why are you-\" \"I won't be able to stay too long, Mrs. Peters,-\" Archy stops short, hand still on the doorknob. He stares at Johnny a good, long time, before he realizes what Mrs. Peters is holding. He shuts the door gently, eyes stopping on Johnny again. \"What's going on?\" He asks calmly. \"I'm sorry, Archy. I tried to get him to leave.\" He glances at her, shaking his head dismissively. \"Don't...Don't worry about it, Mrs. Peters. \" He straightens, shoves his hands in his pockets. \"Johnny Boy.\" \"' Ello, Arch! \" He practically squeals. \"You've aged. Though, you do seem to still be shrouded in shadows, just like the old days.\" He looks at Mrs. Peters, voice barely producing sound as he tilts his head up. \"Put it away.\" She nods, scurries in the direction of his office. \"Int'resting.\" Johnny snorts. \"Didn't know you had it in you.\" \"Watch your mouth, John. What do you need?\" \"What, I can't just drop by? Say hello?\" \"I see you didn't waste time getting to my smokes and liquor.\" He smirks. \"Just a bonus. I was really looking for cash, but it appears you've gotten smart and stashed it somewhere else.\" \"You should go on, John. I'm not going to provide for your junkie habits.\" He starts to brush past him, hoping (yet knowing he won't) leave, like one of those brief headaches one gets when they first wake up. He doesn't. \"You're the second person wanting to rush me out of the place. You'd think I haven't been here before. Something going on? Someone you don't want me to-\" The front door opens. Abby steps in quietly, rucksack on the floor next to the coat rack, door shut behind her, before she notices the two men. She starts, eyes bouncing back and forth between the amusement (or is it awe?) on the face of the stranger, and the hostile, yet calm expression worn by her uncle. She seems to shrink a few inches, head dropping significantly enough to make a tuft of hair fall down across her left eye. \"Am...Am I in-interrupting something?\" She stutters. Archy strides forward, lodging himself between the two significantly younger people (almost blocking the girl completely from Johnny's line of view), shaking his head. \"No, no. Johnny-boy was just leaving. Why don't you go see if Mrs. Peters needs help with anything?\" He doesn't bother to look at her, choosing instead to send a pointed look in Johnny's direction. Johnny watches the kid glide by, head still dipped low, posture slumped as though being closer to the floor will make her blend with it. \"Who's that, then?\" Archy glares, hands balling into fists at his sides. \"I believe you saw the paper, now, didn't you?\" Abby pauses just beyond the opening that leads into the spacious hallway, hidden just from sight. Paper? She inches toward the mouth of the hall, skinny body flattened against the wall, shoulders tense, nose stopping just inches from the frame. \"I believe I would remember that little bird running around your flat.\" \"Shut it.\" Archy snaps. Abby's brows knit together. Why is he getting so angry? \"What? So she made a mistake, got off on the-\" SLAP! Abby flinches, clamps a hand over her mouth as Johnny's glasses fly off his face and against the wall, where one of the lenses shatters. Archy grabs the smaller man by the lapels of his jacket, bends him backward over the nearest couch back. \" Shut it,\" He snarls, not even an inch from the junkie's face. \" You poisonous little toad .\" She strains her ears for the bits he says after that, but it's too low. Whatever it is, and judging by the stranger's face, she wouldn't want to hear it herself. He's practically growling at the man, a growl so deep in the bottom of his throat it can only be pushed out from the pit of his belly. I have to find this paper. She decides. Archy straightens, suddenly, yanking Johnny up like a used t-shirt, slings him across the room like a sack of rubbish. \"Get out.\" The junkie stoops to pick up his ruined shades, gestures at the gangster with them, unfazed. \"You really should do something about that temper, Uncle...You're liable to kill someone...someday.\" He wiggles his brows, waves one of the stolen cigarettes in the air between them, and leaves. Archy stares at the closed front door for a moment, curses loudly under his breath. He looks down at the back of his reddened right hand, turning for the hallway with a quick stride. Abby gasps, frozen for a moment in fear. She turns to run, only realize her footsteps will be a dead giveaway. She thinks for a split nano-second about confronting him. Who was that? Why'd you hit him? What's this paper he was talking about? Why did you get so angry? Maybe she could just play stupid, act like she's headed for the kitchen like she didn't witness anything that played out before her. Too late. Archy rounds the corner like a bull, coming up short with wide eyes to avoid running into her. He doesn't stop fast enough, however, managing to bump her back a step or two. Abby yelps, flings her arms up instinctively to protect her face. Two bear paws of hands grab her shoulders and steady her, manage to make her peer fearfully up at the brawny guy. \"Easy, there! You alright?\" He asks. She nods, a little too vigorously. \"Uncle.\" She squeaks. \"Sorry, I didn't hear you coming.\" Another vigorous nod. \"It's fine.\" She says quickly, still wide-eyed. She stares at him, chews on her lower lip. \"He called you uncle.\" Decision made. Confrontation it is. He cocks his head. \"What?\" \"Uncle.\" She says with more confidence. \"He called you uncle . You hit him, and he called you uncle .\" A nervous lump forms in her throat, makes it difficult for her to swallow. He stares at her for a moment, eyes narrowing. \"How long have you been standing here?\" She begins to wonder about the intelligence of this decision, takes a shaky breath. Dropping her head, she murmurs, \"I saw the whole thing. I heard something about a paper, and I stopped to listen, and then I saw how angry you were getting...so I wanted to see what was so significant about a piece of paper.\" He studies her bowed head, allows the resignation and fear to seep into his brain. He can feel her shoulders trembling beneath his hands, see her visibly shaking in front of him. She's scared of you, his mind whispers, and for some reason, it makes his throat tighten. Stings, don't it? He sighs, allows his right hand to drop to his side, while the other remains on her shoulder. \"Look at me.\" He says quietly. She tilts her head up, just enough to peer at him from beneath her eyebrows. A longer, louder sigh whooshes out of his lungs; the other hand comes back up to rest on her shoulder again. \"No, come on. Look at me.\" He repeats, a bit forcefully this time. She lifts her head up, swallows nervously. \"Mhm?\" It's practically a whimper. The twinge of pain grows, this time in his chest. He doesn't understand why it takes so much strength to keep his face composed in a mask of tenderness...why he finds himself trying to hide disappointment. His grip tightens gently on her shoulders, thumbs rubbing the ends of her collarbones. \"That man that was just here?\" He says quietly, motioning toward the front door, \"That was my godson. I've been around him since he was just a toddler.\" He looks off to the side for a moment, collecting his thoughts. \"He's trouble, Abby.\" His gaze pierces into hers, hands gripping her shoulders just for impact. \" Nothing but trouble...and I want you to stay as far away from him as possible, hear? If you see him on the streets, go the opposite direction. If he comes around the flat, don't let him in. If you can't avoid talking to him, if he wants anything... anything at all, from you or me, I want you tell me immediately. \" His brows arch, head cocked to the right. \"Got it?\" She nods nervously. He mirrors her response, thumbs stroking again. \"He won't get you anywhere. In no way will he ever be able to give you good help, so don't let him get to you. He's sneaky. He knows how to use words to his advantage, which is why I want you to avoid him as best you can.\" \"Okay.\" She whispers. She summons up as much courage as she can, forcing herself to look at him directly. \"What...What was the paper?\" A long, steady stream of air flows lightly through his nose, and again, he has to look off to the side. His eyes soften when he looks back at her, and he allows his right hand to drop. \"It's not important.\" Liar. \"A business document. Don't worry about it, alright?\" The other hand drops from her shoulder. He gives her a light smile. \"How was school?\" Just like that? He's going to drop that whole situation...Just. Like. That. \"Okay. You know...it was...school.\" \"Catching up on your marks?\" \"Yeah. I turned in everything I missed...Back up to straight A's...again.\" This earns a more genuine smile. He nods, pats her on the shoulder. \"Good, good.\" He glances down at his watch, sighs. \"I've got to get back to work...Lunch is over, I'm afraid.\" \"But...You didn't eat anything.\" He turns and looks at her from the corner of his eye, surprised with her concern after everything she just witnessed. Just like her mum... \"I'll be fine. Stay out of trouble.\" She stops in front of the window and watches him fold up into the backseat of a black car, situate himself before...Turbo, she thinks his name is, shuts the door for him, and climbs in himself. Why would a real-estate agent need a chauffeur? Even after they drive off, she stares at the spot they'd previously occupied, and scratches her brain over the events that occurred. 9:00pm, same day... It's always marveled her that such a beautiful blue sky during the day can turn into such a foreboding black ink pad at night. Beams of moonlight slink in and out of the familiar London storm clouds, highlighted a most boring shade of grey by the dull city lights. What used to be inviting tree branches transform into skeletal hands, the bony fingers all reaching out to grasp a tuft of her hair, or an article of her clothing. The temperature, which was a pleasant 21*C earlier in the day, is now a freezing 7.2*C, forcing her to tighten the scarf about her neck and zip up the remaining space in her jacket. Her gloveless fingers shake uncontrollably, dry and red from the cold. She curses herself for forgetting gloves...and her extra thick pair of socks. There's nothing to do about it now. She reminds herself. I'm already here...No turning back now. The black gates of the cemetery seem to have an eerie sort of illumination about them, highlighted by the moonlight. They protest loudly at her when she slowly opens the left side of the gate, leaving just enough room for herself to squeeze in, then close it again. A torch lays at the bottom of her knapsack, but she doesn't retrieve it; the cemetery is a vast ocean of headstones, but she knows exactly where she's going. She weaves in and out of plots like a robot, programed to go solely to one destination, her icy right hand gliding across every stone as she goes. The ground shifts beneath her feet, tripping her up at times, clinging to her shoes as though the cemetery is a muddy hell that even the ecosystem doesn't want to be apart of. It's all the doing of the earlier rain, making everything seem worse than it is. But, she keeps going, her brain already connected to the prize laying just a few yards ahead of her. She stops, finally, almost in the middle of the boneyard, sinking down to the soggy ground in front of a salt-and-pepper granite tombstone. Her blue-jeans absorb the moisture, mud clinging to her clothing and chilling her legs down to the bones, but she doesn't care. Her trembling fingers reach out, stroke the sculpted letters before her; she doesn't need a torch to know that the letters form the dearest name to her soul: Richie. The shout that she's been holding back lodges its way out of her throat, coming out in a choked sob as tears run unchecked down her cheeks, leaving arctic-cold trails behind. \"Everything is so out of place!\" She yells through the tears. The sobs make her double over, fingers grabbing fistfuls of mud. \"I can't trust anyone...Not even your brother!\" She throws her head back, wails at the black abyss above her head. \" Why did you leave? Why did you leave me so alone ?\" She pounds at the wet ground with muddied fists, sending bits of Earth flying onto the tombstone, out to the sides, up onto her sleeves and torso. A scream rips through her throat, ravaging her voice box and leaving her soundless for a moment, quiet sobs jerking spastically at her body. Despite all this, she can still feel the tension. It fills her torso up like a helium balloon, forcing the pressure into her heart, demanding it to pump it out into her veins. It eats away at her until she can't take it anymore, the mixture of the invisible bruising and the thin, chilled air not leaving her enough room to breathe. She reaches with cobra speed to her back pocket, whipping the object out in front of her face without hesitation. The blade of Archy's straight-razor is cold, but ever so inviting. She yanks back her right sleeve, revealing a single scar resting diagonally across her wrist, and allows the blade to do the rest. The liquid running down her arm is nearly scorching compared to the cold. She makes another line. Warmth. Warmth! Screams her mind. She goes at it until she has six new wounds vomiting crimson, releasing the built-up pressure in her body like a boiling tea kettle. She falls limply to the ground, fingers ripping at the Earth to get to the corpse down below. She digs until she can't dig anymore, the emotional and physical exhaustion too much to bear. The sobs play out into a decrescendo of hiccups, the tears narrow down to just a few drops, until they run no more. The girl in question spits out mud and bits of vegetation that worked their way into her mouth during the episode, before she sits up and kisses the granite, the ever beloved name across it. After a few minutes (she doesn't know how many), she drags herself up to her feet with the chunk of polished rock, pulls the sleeve down, and makes her way out. From the shadows, a figure dressed in all black (even his tie and socks) watches, a notepad and pen in hand. His lips twist up into a disgusted smirk as he jots down everything played out before him, from the agonized sobs to the very last drops of scarlet liquid. He waits for Abby to leave the cemetery before quietly following her down the street, then watches as she stands just beneath the back window of a non-too-fancy, non-too-shabby flat. His eyes feast on her skin as she peals off the filthy clothes, studies and memorizes the curves of her body before she jumps up and climbs through the window, naked, leaving the pile of clothing and knapsack behind. Now, feeling more jovial than ever, he strolls down the sidewalk, fingertips tapping happily on the notepad in his jacket pocket. I know, I know, it's been too long. I apologize! You know that thing? That thing (not the board game) called Life? Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh, you know what I'm talking about. That's why. So, now you know. You know what to do now, right? You click that little bar that says \"Review Chapter\", and you tell me everything you thought about the writing (even if it's something you completely despise)! So, I would appreciate it. Special thanks to SelenesLegacy, G.G. Blithe, and Ennya for your thoughts. Please keep me posted! Thank you![Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not own anything pertaining to RocknRolla, save for characters and plot unoriginal to the movie. Thanks. You'd think it were a holiday, there are so many people. They all shove past one another as though the other is just an inanimate object, kind of like when someone runs their hip into the arm of the couch, or rubs shoulders with the lampshade. A polite few laugh it off and apologize, while others simply glare and continue on their way. Mrs. Peters stands safely to the side; the ingredients of a jar of tomato paste face her. Abby simply stands, shoulders sagging, eyes downcast at the head of the basket. In passing, one would think she has an odd obsession with her shoes, for that's where her gaze seems to stay. If one cares to take a closer look (which, no one does), they would notice that her eyes don't look at all...they don't even see . They seem to only exist, glazed over as they sit in the sockets, her mind wandering over nothing in particular. Every now and then her right pointer finger will twitch, a shiver will travel her spine, but for the most part, she stands absolutely still. It isn't until a basket hits her from behind that she remembers she's in public. \"Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, I-\" A brief pause. \"Abby! Hello!\" She turns slowly on the spot, eyes still focused on the floor, arms limp and dangling at her sides. The irises sweep slowly up from the person's feet (clad in black stiletto heels), up the well sculpted legs, past the curvy torso, and finally, up into the woman's eyes. She's never noticed before that Lizzie is built to be a model, fit, athletic, rather than a doctor. She's surprised she notices it now, as foggy as her mind is. She feels like she's looking through a pair of dirty glasses; the lenses are covered in small particle debris, making everything look fuzzy and out of place. Where detail should be, only shape and color resides; Instead of the shine in Lizzie's blonde hair, it's just a golden haze. They're giving her headache, and she longs for nothing more than to reach up and take them off...only they don't exist. She looks back down at the heels, blinks twice, long and slow. \"How can you walk in those?\" Now Lizzie blinks, looks slowly down at her shoes. Realizing the joke, she smiles, chuckles softly. \"Oh, these. Just lots of practice, I suppose.\" Only when Abby doesn't laugh back does she take a closer look...and what she notices shoots an icy burst of shock into her chest. The healthy, golden shine that used to make Abby's hair stand out from the crowd is no longer there, replaced by a dull, yellow glare. It reminds her of a pair of gold earrings she'd had once; they looked beautiful and shiny in the package, but after a few weeks of wear and tear, she realized they weren't gold at all...but gold plated. They had turned the radius of her piercings green, and though this isn't the case with Abby's hair, she can't help but look for the same effect. She also notices with the distaste of a doctor that her skin is no longer fair, her cheeks no longer containing their endearing rosiness. It's paled in comparison to a pallid complexion, reminding her of that sun-bleached cigarette billboard she sees every morning on her way to work. Sweat adorns her brow, some beads of the liquid absorbed by her hairline and slight female sideburns. Some of the drops even run down the side of her right temple, a few falling into and irritating the red-rimmed eyes. The eyes ! They're the most disturbing of all. That special, priceless sparkle that used to swim and grin in the pupils and irises is no more, destroyed and replaced by the harsh, black reality of depression. They no longer seem to look at anything in wonder, drink the miracle of life itself. They only look through things, haunted and hollow. Her clothing, a plain black t-shirt and tan capris, no longer cling to her body like a few weeks ago, but hang on her like a scarecrow. The cheekbones and jaw are too prominent, the neck too thin. It takes everything in Lizzie not to shake her head. She feels as though she could snap that delicate neck without hardly any effort at all. The collarbones seem to jut out from the collar of the shirt, and even appear to make an impression at the tops of the sleeves on the other ends. She can't find the outline of her belly...only the loose gathering of cloth just beneath the hips. Even her shoes seem a bit bigger around the ankles. Lizzie puts on her best effort of a smile...the one she usually keeps reserved for hopeful families of a patient that she just might be able to keep afloat, while knowing at the same time they could fall through, and there'd be nothing she could do but make them comfortable. It never quite reaches her eyes, but somehow reflects itself in her voice; the voice has always been the easier part to fake. \"Abby,\" She says with a jovial note, \"I seem to have skipped something on my list. Could you run to the poultry section and pick up a four pack of chicken breasts for me?\" Abby doesn't make eye contact. She doesn't smile. She doesn't nod. She simply turns, hands shoved deeply in her pockets, and walks away. As soon as she's out of earshot, Lizzie turns to Mrs. Peters, the concern brighter than sunlight in her eyes. \"Mrs. Peters, have you noticed anything... different about Abby? Maybe phy-\" \"Oh, dear, I was hoping you'd get around to it!\" Mrs. Peters says, a wash of relief gushing from her words. \"I can't get her to eat, and if she ever does, it's just a nibble.\" \"Well, has Archy noticed?\" She asks hopefully. \"Surely if Archy-\" \"He's tried taking us out for dinner every other night. We've both tried to get her talk about her favorite foods...Nothing.\" She shakes her head. Sighs. \"I've never seen him worried like this before. It's not just hurting her health...it's hurting ours , too, Liz.\" Lizzie remains silent, looks down the isle for a particularly ill-looking blonde. \"Mrs. Peters, I hate to barge in, but-\" Mrs. Peters tisks, swats the younger woman on the shoulder. \"You never barge, dear! Your presence is always welcome in our home, even if he won't say it is... foolish man.\" She mumbles. Now Mrs. Peters looks around the corner, too, and smiles. \"Why don't you come over tonight? I'll treat you to dinner.\" She sighs again when Abby comes back into view. \"Perhaps you can get her to eat something.\" Lizzie reapplies her everything-is-fine-for-now-but-could-fall-through doctor's smile as Abby rounds the corner, patting her on the shoulder as she places the pack of chicken breast in her basket. \"Thank you, darling. You just saved me a second trip.\" The right corner of her mouth twitches up for a few seconds, before dropping down to a neutral, thinly pressed line. The hands once again find their home in her pockets, and the gaze once again falls to the floor. Mrs. Peters passes a pained expression over the teen's head. \"Shall we say, six o'clock?\" Lizzie nods, responding with an expression of the same nature. \"Certainly.\" She's beginning to wonder about her mental health. A graveyard is a good place to sit and ponder. It's quiet. Not many people enter them. Some are even downright afraid of them. Superstitious. Some flat-out silly about it. You can't possibly be disturbed while sitting in one. ...Can you? She wonders if being surrounded by the dead is doing her as much good as she thinks. The place is calm, after all. He can't kiss her cheeks anymore...at least, not like he used to could. Out here, she can feel his kisses in the sunshine, feel the warmth that his corpse now lacks. She can feel his strong arms through the gentle breeze, embracing her weak, emotionally drained body. His fingers playfully tickle her bare feet through the grass that's springing up on top and around him. Out here, in this little patch dedicated to the dearly departed...he's everywhere. Sometimes, she can even swear he's whispering to her through the weeds when that embracing breeze sweeps across them. She shakes her head. How can't this be helping her? She lays down atop the flattened dirt patch, now dry due to the good graces of the sunlight. Her jacket rests just at the base of Richie's tombstone, folded over just enough times for her head to be comfortable against the salt and pepper granite, ankles crossed and propped on the footstone. She locks her fingers atop her belly, stares up the sky. A gentle breeze stirs the weeds around her, plays with her hair, before shoving it down over her eyes. She brushes it away with a smile, listening contently to the voice in the weeds. 2 years ago \" About time you got home.\" Despite the two bottles of nail polish, ancient library books, and mobile phone, she allows her knapsack to fall unceremoniously to the floor. It's been a long day. Long day as in, it's like all the teachers got together and said, \"Right then. Let's give all our classes a test today. Never mind that it's friday.\" She rolls her shoulders with a groan, allows her uniform jacket to join the knapsack. \"I'm doing fine, thanks. My day was a bit long, but at least it's the weekend, right, dad?\" She steps to the small room to the right, leaving her things in the center of the living room. Soon, her skirt and school shoes join the other objects, replaced with a loose pair of track pants and a t-shirt. She isn't surprised to see him lying in the grass behind the flat. Not much of what he does ever surprises her. She stands beside him in her bare feet, allows her shadow to spread across his face. \"Enjoying yourself?\" He cracks open his right eye, just long enough to take in her attire. \"You're blocking my sun.\" \" Again, glad to see you, too. You could ask me why my day was long, or why I'm so tired.\" He folds his hands behind his head and crosses his ankles, a slight smile tugging at his lips. \"I could. Or, I could just tell you to shut up and join me.\" Abby takes a long look at the grass before seating herself, pleased that there are no stickers, or ant piles, before laying back all the way. He allows a few moments of silence to pass between them, before looking up at the sky. \"You see that cloud?\" She draws in a long breath. \"You'll have to be a bit more specific. Aren't we a little old for this game, anyway?\" \" Would you just look?\" The long breath is released in an impatient sigh. \"What one?\" He points up, and slightly to the left, casting the shadow of his arm over her belly. \"That one. What's it look like?\" \" A cloud.\" She responds dryly. Now Richie sighs. \"If you're not going to participate, the whole class will have to go inside.\" \" What class? You call two people a class?\" \" Any number of people willing to learn is a class.\" \" If this is one of your life lessons-\" \" Do you want extra chores?\" \" It looks like a person.\" \" Any specific type of person?\" She groans. \"I don't know...A woman.\" He smiles. \"Good guess. It reminds me of your mother.\" \" It looks nothing like mum! The hair is all wrong-\" \" That's not the point. It's a cloud shaped like a woman. Your mum would lay out and look at the clouds with me.\" He looks over at her. \"Your mum never thought there was an age limit.\" Now she looks at him. \"So...the lesson is...\" \" Do you have to turn everything I say into a lesson?\" \" What? This wasn't to make an example out of something?\" \" I was just trying to have a bit of fun.\" He leans over to poke her in the side, effectively tickling her. \"Don't be afraid to have a bit of fun every now and then, alright? Even if it seems childish.\" \" That's the lesson?\" \" ...I've noticed that you haven't been very happy lately. Just...have some fun. Have some childish fun-\" \"Have some childish fun.\" She chuckles to the wind. \"That's even better.\" \" That's even better!\" \"But-\" She looks to the right, only to be surprised by an empty, grassy space. Her eyes roam wildly, she sits up to see if he's gone inside the flat, only...this isn't the lot behind it. She isn't even wearing track pants and a t-shirt, she's back in her uniform. The most shocking revelation, is that she's certain she had heard him. She could've sworn she had just had a conversation with him, even felt him tickle her. She bolts upright and stares at the wrought iron fence to her left, and to her right, her heart sinking at the realization...tombstones. She turns around just to assure herself, nearly weeping with the horrible truth that she is, in fact, leaning against a tombstone that says, Richard Crackit Adoring Husband Loving Father 16 April 1968 - 18 March 2011 A large, black shadow is coming at her when she turns back around...a shadow that seems to consume anything and everything in its path. It seems to have no end. It covers the buildings for miles out, eats up the sidewalks, the roads, until it's right within the graveyard. It passes up the tombstones without slowing, right up to the bottoms of her tennis shoes, until she herself is deep within its belly. Looking up at the sky, she realizes a large cloud cover had been forming during her hallucination, traveling along with all the time in the world, unnoticed, until it decided to consume the sun, blocking out all of the warmth...blocking out all of Richie. It's all she can do to hold back the tears as she climbs to her feet, using the headstone for support. Everything feels heavy. It's as though someone has strapped concrete blocks to her feet, forcing her to drag them through the patches of dirt and grass, leaving scrape marks on the sidewalk when she finally reaches it. There's an odd adhesive on the backs and palms of her hands, something strong enough to hold a pair of bricks on each. They swing and sway at her sides, forcing her shoulders forward. Her stomach has rocks in it. Small, individual pieces of gravel and pebbles, and they all roll and shift every time she drags a foot, scraping the lining, trickling slowly into her intestines. They make her want to double over and vomit right there in the street, but she has nothing in her belly. No food, no liquids, just stomach acid. Her head is the heaviest. The last vain attempt to keep it up is to keep her chin from resting on her chest as she drags herself forward. Her brain hurts in places she didn't know could hurt. Someone's driven nails in it. Someone else is pounding it with a hammer, pounding hard enough to make her give up on all legible thought. Someone has written graffiti across her eyes with thick black and white paint. Some of it mingles together over her pupils, forming spotty shades of gray, depending on where she looks. What scares her the most...is her chest. The breastbone is built directly over the heart. It serves as an anchor to keep the collarbones aligned directly beneath the esophagus, to help keep the shoulders pulled back. It allows for the ribs to have something to grip on the front, so they're not precariously just clinging to the ever so fragile spinal disks in the back...though one could argue that cartilage is hardly a strong adhesive. After all, it's what gives the nose shape, and noses can be broken easily. However weak or strong, the ribs do circle around and house the lungs, forming a virtual prison. The lungs, however light, however flimsy, adjust and curve in their environment to allow room for...the heart. Though the left lung mostly has the hassle of staying out of the way of the body of the heart, even the one on the right has to make room for the superior vena cava and right atrium is divinely placed and adjusted to stay out of the way of the muscle that has the equal importance of the brain, and yet...she can't feel it. Everything in her body feels sluggish and heavy, but the only things she can feel moving in her chest are the lungs, filling like balloons, then deflating like beach balls to be stored for the winter. She can feel her frontal ribs being pushed upward and out, allowing the cartilage to flex just enough for the lungs to go as far as needed, before retracting down into starting position once again. But, the heart... She'd reach to her neck to grope for a pulse...if her hands weren't so heavy. She'd stop and listen for the tell-tale sign of pumping, but everything around her is so loud. Buses barrel past her on the street like angry elephants, little black London taxies pierce the air with their shrill horns. Babies, God bless them, cry after being woken from their blissful sleep. Dogs bark in passing on the other side of the street. They all seem to move so...so... fast. Everyone appears to be in such a hurry. They all move past her like a blur, and she feels like she's moving in slow motion. She feels like a snail, slithering at her own pace of altered time, and they're all race cars. Even the split second of her eyelids moving feels like closing them for a good minute. She's got to get out of here. She's got to get off the sidewalks, away from the streets. She's got to know that there isn't just some dark, vacant cave where her heart should be. She's got to see if there's even blood moving through her body. She...Needs... A blade. This can't be happening. Where she expected the air to be silent, she finds it pregnant with laughter. Dishes clank against one another. Silverware clashes together like angry swords in the midst of a battle. Somewhere near, a television is going. She wants to bang her head against the wall until the world goes black. Of all the things Archy's flat is, it's not social. It's like a library. The sacred rules are to not disturb the silence, or the master at work (unless you're Mrs. Peters), and this is hardly a place of concentration. The master is the operator of the offending high definition television. He's only watching the news, of course, but in all the months she's lived here, she's never once seen it turned on . Just like in the memory, she allows her knapsack to fall to the floor with a dead thud. Dead . Just how she feels. Archy turns his head with a start, glances at his watch before standing. \"Abby-\" Mrs. Peters (followed by Lizzie), comes out of the kitchen the moment the word leaves his lips, reminding Abby of the first note of a piece of music after just the right beat from the metronome. \"You're late, dear! Dinner's going to be ready soon. Where have you been ?\" Her tone is like that of a rattle snake: the rattler is fun to listen to while the snake is behind glass, but out in the wild, one venomous bite has the potential to kill. All of the oxygen in the room seems to vanish. She wouldn't say the atmosphere is hostile, but it is most definitely tense. It reminds her of the particular occasion in which her ten year old self had strictly been told to stay away from the dirty dishes while dad was washing them. Wanting nothing more than to help, she grabbed one, and, not expecting the rim of the plate to be so greasy, sent it crashing to the floor in hundreds of pieces...and much like Humpty Dumpty, it couldn't be put back together...ever again. She'd started out on a quest just to help, just to lend a courteous hand...Yet the gesture ended badly. Richie had just stared at her, disappointed and irritated...much like Mrs. Peters. \"Abby,\" Lizzie starts, breaking the memory, \"Are you alright? You look a bit pale.\" She stares at her for a moment, taking in the concern in the elegantly arched brows, the slightly parted lips as the doctor surveys the infected. She doesn't even have to look at Mrs. Peters to know what's going through her mind, the mother hen that clucks crossly at the last chick to enter the nest. She can never read what Archy's thinking. He just stands there, hands in pockets, neutral eyes waiting for a response to the doctor's question. She releases a shaky breath, realizing she'd been holding it all the while, and hangs her jacket on the coatrack. \"I just went to see Dad, is all.\" She side-glances at Chicken Little, assuming a posture non too different from Archy's. \"Is...that alright?\" Her voice is timid, the last line of defense; perhaps if she lays defenseless before the bear, it'll lose interest, stop attacking. Mrs. Peters sighs, soothed over for now. \"It's fine, dear.\" She says gently. \"Just, call next time you're going to be late, hm? Now, come along, everyone. Help me set dinner out on the table.\" Archy and Abby carry a few dishes, along with Lizzie, but it's mostly Mrs. Peters, with her proverbial bee-line, that sets everything out. Archy assumes his usual seat at the head of the table, directly across from Lizzie. Abby sits at his left hand, and after rushing a few finishing touches, Mrs. Peters sits to his right. Enticing a meal as it is (for Mrs. Peters always prepares meals fit for a king , no matter the company), Abby feels none of its appeal. The potatoes are diced, cooked to fall apart in the mouth, but to remain firm enough as to not fall off the fork on the way there, absolutely dripping with butter, sprinkled with pepper. The steak is basking in its own delectable juices, the dinner rolls are crisp and flaky (but positively fluffy on the inside), and the wine is fine and sweet. The smells alone, however, make her want to gag. She forces a straight face only for the sake of Mrs. Peters, trying to think of happier times to help it along. She knows she won't be comfortable while she sits here, surrounded by the small, cautious conversations swimming mockingly inside her ears. Her face feels hot, practically burning as every light source in the house seems to be shining in her direction. There's a force pressing in on her eardrums and cerebrum, a pair of hands, clasping harder and harder, until they feel like they're going to detonate, send oozing bits of brain careening down the sides of her neck. Her silverware is eased on either side of the plate, allowing her to cradle the sides of her cranium with shaking hands. She feels sick to her stomach...and the pressure. She can feel the steam building up, buzzing beneath the surface of her skin like a water heater about to explode. She bites back the nausea, swallows down the provocative bile wanting so desperately to surface over the tongue and between her teeth. She excuses herself quietly and speeds away from the table, one hand grasping her stomach, the other clamped over her mouth in a theatric display. It's the only way Mrs. Peters will allow her to leave the table this night, almost a week since she last ate properly. Archy watches her retreating form with a sinking stomach, leans back against his chair with a sigh. Mrs. Peters wipes at her mouth with a bit more force than is necessary, tosses her napkin on the table in defeat. \"Do you see what I mean? Not even one bite this time.\" Lizzie nods, filing away all the information for later diagnosis. \"She's depressed, Mrs. Peters. Have you thought of sending her to a clinic? They could get her on an IV; She'll get all the nutrients and therapy she needs.\" Mrs. Peters looks anxiously at Archy, brows raising. He sighs again, also discarding his napkin on the table. \"I know you don't like the idea, Archy, but we've discussed this.\" Mrs. Peters presses. \"If a clinic can sort out people like Johnny Quid -\" \"Abby's nothing like Johnny.\" He cuts in, shakes his head. \"She's not a junkie, not an alcoholic-\" \"How can you know for certain?\" Lizzie asks gently. \"She's depressed, she could be-\" \"She's not.\" He says firmly. His brows raise slightly, eyes opening wider as he studies the two women. His voice drops drastically, almost a murmur. \"She's not. I would know if she were doing drugs; Lenny hires crack-heads to do the dirty work on the streets. She doesn't have the tell-tale signs-\" Mrs. Peters places a weary hand on top of his, curls her fingers into his palm to silence him. \"She's starving herself, Arch. Surely that's just as bad?\" Lizzie draws her brows together as she listens to the exchange. \"How often does she stay in her room?\" Mrs. Peters pauses, removes her hand from Archy's. \"She's in there all the time. She doesn't come out for breakfast in the mornings, so I suspect she's just sulking around in there before school. Then, she's right back in there, just as soon as she gets back.\" Lizzie fingers the stem of her wine glass, lips pressed in a thin line. \"Do you know what time school lets out? Is she coming home directly after? Or many hours after the time?\" Mrs. Peters shakes her head. \"Never. It's always many hours after the bell rings. She always stops off at that...\" Her nose wrinkles in disgust, the words practically rolling off her tongue like venom. \"That graveyard . She stays there for hours on end. It can't possibly be helping her.\" Lizzie nods, stares at her plate. She reaches up a tired hand to massage her forehead, trying without ease to remember that one psychology class she took at university...all those years ago. What were those different stages of depression? \"How does she look when she does come out of her room? Aside from on the way to class, or to run errands. Does she appear more relaxed? Is she happier? No difference at all?\" She directs her attention to Archy, getting to her feet now as she begins to think faster. \"Does she speak to you?\" He shakes his head, opens his arms a little. \"Me? I haven't seen any difference.\" A deep sigh flows gently out of his nose. \"And no, she doesn't speak to me anymore.\" \"Why do you suppose that is, then?\" He snorts. \"Well, I don't know. Maybe I remind her too much of-\" A string of curses floats from down the hall to where the three adults are sitting. Lizzie shares a look with Mrs. Peters, before both turn to Archy. They all stand and run when a louder, toe scrunching scream pierces the air. She knows that it's wrong. In therapy, they don't fail to mention it to you...five, ten times. \" There are other ways to deal with your emotions.\" They say. \" You can take out your frustrations on a sport, say...boxing, or football. Work yourself physically, so you can wear yourself out mentally. Your body is a work of art. What is self-mutilation going to help?\" Abby stares at herself in the mirror, concentrating on the voice of her past therapist. Her tone was soothing, words carefully chosen, pronounced slowly and deliberately as she smoothed out the decidedly rough parts of the words. She takes a deep breath, watching the memory play out on the smooth surface of the glass. \" But, what if cutting helps me?\" The therapist had simply tilted her head, crossing her legs as she readjusted her writing pad. \"How so?\" \" It's like I've been bitten by a venomous snake, or spider.\" She squeezes her eyes shut as she whispers with the memory, though it does nothing to keep the tears from falling over the edges. The straight-razor rests only a few feet away on the lavatory, barely within reach of her shaking fingers. \" Thinking about my mum is like releasing the poison into my body. It goes straight to my heart, where it's pumped out into my entire body through the bloodstream. The poison attacks my muscles, makes them swell up to the point that they feel like they're going to explode. The bloating of these muscles makes my internal organs feel like they're being squeezed. The worst part is when my chest feels like it's swollen. The force is pressing in on my ribcage, which, ultimately, is restricting my lungs.\" She had paused there to look at the psychologist, her breaths heavy and uneven, tears threatening to spill over. \"Have you ever heard of, \"I Was Bitten\"? It's an American television program. It's about these people that get bitten by venomous snakes, spiders, stung by Africanized bees, shark attacks, bear attacks, and how the person survived.\" She stopped to swallow, but her tongue was dry. The glass of water that sat next to her had never stood a chance. \"Well, there was this one man...I think he got bitten by a rattlesnake. His throat swelled up so badly, that they had to shove an air tube down his trachea , and his muscles were so swollen...\" She closed her eyes, pictured the footage, \"The muscles in his arm were so swollen, that they had to cut it open, or else it would have... popped , basically.\" The therapist wrinkled her nose in disgust, but Abby didn't notice. She'd been on a roll, finally able to describe just what her pain felt like...in a way she'd never been able to tell her father. \"Well...that's basically how I feel.\" She'd said, her voice softened, almost a whisper. \"If I don't cut myself, if I don't allow my muscles to expand...I'm going to suffocate.\" The therapist had just stared at her, amazed by this...this child's use of words. Even some of the adults she'd had to work with weren't this grammatically gifted. She didn't really know what to say, how to respond. She'd just sat, legs crossed, note pad limply hanging in her fingers. \"W-well,\" She'd stuttered, \"What if Leonardo Da Vinci got frustrated at his work? What if he took a knife to it every time he was-\" Abby shakes her head, splashes some cool water on her face from the faucet. She'd never felt so hopeless than she did in that therapist's office; she'd poured her heart out, and the woman couldn't even figure out what to say in response. Needless to say, she'd never seen that particular psychologist ever again...they just gave up and sent her to a mental hospital, left her in there with regular visits until she got better. Her stomach turns at the thought as a few more tears leak out. Would they do that to her again? Would Archy even bother to visit her, too disappointed to have to go to a place like that? Mrs. Peters would, she knows that for certain. Kind, old Widow Peters, with her gentle, yet firm disposition. Maybe even Lizzie would come to see her. But Archy? Her hand slides a few more inches across the lavatory, putting the straight-razor just slightly closer... \"I hate you.\" She whispers to the object. \"I hate you so much.\" But, I comfort you. It coos. Remember? I help you relax. \"You make the venom go away.\" She takes a step over, putting it well within reach. \" I'm so disappointed in you.\" She whirls on the spot, wide eyes darting around the room like an angry bee trying to find a way back outside. That voice . That was Richie's voice. She throws open the closet door, rips the shower curtain off its rungs, revealing a dripping shower head. She's all alone. But...that voice ! It had been so loud , so clear , as though he'd been standing right next to her, speaking directly into her feels like she's breathing through a straw, breaths shortened to desperate gasps as she struggles for air. Her heart has relocated itself. She lays a trembling hand on her throat, discovering its new home in her airway. She's got to get it out of there, got to rip it out and put it back where it belongs. Come here, darling. The blade whispers. I'll make breathing bearable. She looks up at it, on her knees now. Only one arm is supporting her weight, pressing painfully down on the counter to keep her from falling. \"You're going to kill me!\" She screams. No! No! Never kill! It assures . Only make everything better. A choked sob forces its way past her heart, ricochets off the walls of the tiny room, only to shoot their own master in the ears. She screams at the pain, grabbing the razor as she falls to the floor. \"You can't help! You never help!\" She opens the blade anyway, catching her eyes in its reflection. She's frightened by how she doesn't even look like the same person, rather like a fugitive broken free from his cell, running wildly from the dogs and gunshots not too far behind. \"I'm going crazy.\" She whimpers. \"You can't help my mentality.\" Yes. Yes I can, sweetheart. I can heal your pain, if only for a little while. It murmurs. Come here, embrace me. Let me show you it's going to be okay. She allows herself to cave in to its seduction. The steam is slowly blowing away, the skin opening just enough to allow her muscles to breathe. She gasps blissfully, allowing the coolness of the steel to soothe the consuming fire beneath. The venom that was paralyzing her body runs freely down her forearm, staining the white cloth of her rolled-up sleeve, but she doesn't care. It's all going away, relinquishing its strangle-hold. Her air passage opens up, gives her heart enough room to slip freely from its cramped home, easily traveling safely back between ribs three and four, slithering quietly over her left lung, situating itself easily back between the two airbags. She tries to laugh, relieved with her new-found freedom of oxygen, but it comes out in a sob. She isn't surprised. How many times has she tried to laugh, only for it to turn into more depression? She lays her head back against the cabinet beneath the sink, nose turned up at the ceiling as she lays her bloodied hand on the floor, finally able to loosen her grip on the razor. \"This doesn't change anything.\" She cries tearfully. \"I still hate you, you bastard!\" The door flings against the wall with a deafening crack, showering her with splinters. Someone else is shouting, too, screaming explicit words at her. Archy yanks her up by the back of the shirt, slaps the razor out of her hand, cutting the back of his in the process. \"Ow! You're hurting me!\" She yells at him. He holds her wrist with an iron grasp under the faucet, pins her elbow to the side of the sink to keep her from jerking away. \"You've hurt yourself more than I'm hurting you!\" He yells, not even half a foot from her face. \" What the hell is wrong with you?\" \"I couldn't breathe!\" She shouts back. The sadness leaks down into the drain, disappearing with the blood, only to be replaced by the anger of the crimson. \"So you cut yourself? That doesn't make any damned sense!\" He reaches for the soap, now, scrubbing the cuts with his rough palm. \"You don't understand!\" \"Apparently I don't!\" He scoffs. \"What the f-\" \"Archy.\" Lizzie lays a calm hand on his back, a first aid kit near the sink. \"Calm down.\" She looks quietly over his shoulder, surveying the damage. Abby looks at the woman, curiously, oblivious to whatever Archy says after the attempt to soothe him. Her face is composed into a mask of such...such serenity . There's something so natural about it, yet supernatural at the same time. Her nostrils don't flare like Archy's. Her eyes aren't blazing. She simply observes Archy's work, silently. It's at that moment that she realizes...She isn't Lizzie, the friend, anymore. She's an emergency surgeon. She's Doctor Elizabeth Sheffield. She catches the younger woman staring at her, sighs gently through her nose. She looks back down at her arm, unable to bear the full-fledged disappointment. When she does, her eyes nearly bulge out of their sockets. Seven cuts adorn her forearm, each a different depth or angle. Hadn't she only cut herself twice? Three times, tops? She looks up into the mirror, catching a glimpse of where the razor hit the wall. Blood. Blood spattered on the blue and white wallpaper. Blood spilled all over the floor. Bloody shoe prints where Archy had trekked right through it. Blood still going down the drain. No wonder they're all freaked out...it looks like a crime scene. She lowers her head, hope above hope that Archy won't move his shoulder out from under it in disgust. She realizes now, she didn't just hurt herself. She hurt everyone else in the process. She looks at Archy, brooding but silently cleaning her wounds. Lizzie tries to scrub some of the blood off the wall. For the first time, she notices that there's no trace of Mrs. Peters, not anywhere near. She looks at Archy in the mirror, who looks back down at the lacerates. \"Wh-...Where's Mrs. Peters?\" She whispers. He refuses to look at her, answering stiffly, \"Laying down in her room. She almost fainted when she saw that you'd mutilated yourself.\" Most definitely. She'd let everyone down. Her head lowers back to Archy's shoulder, where she allows herself to cry openly. She hasn't felt this rotten in a long time. Come to think of it, she didn't even feel this tiny and useless at Richie's funeral. The quiet hiccups crescendo back into body jerking, breathy sobs. Archy shifts his weight uncomfortably, glances at Lizzie in the mirror. She simply pushes off from the wall, glances over his shoulder with a satisfied nod. \"Good, Archy. You've cleaned them well enough. I'll go get the hydrogen peroxide from the fridge.\" Watching her leave, he respires an exasperated sigh, turns his attention to the sink. \"Right then.\" He mumbles awkwardly, deciding it's time to turn off the faucet. He seats the crying teen on the edge of the bathtub, himself on the toilet lid, after fetching a hand-towel. Keeping his head down, he allows her to rest her arm in his lap, where he keeps firm pressure on it. It's only now that he notices he's bleeding, as well. It must have happened when he'd swatted the razor away, but it doesn't bother him...He's had worse. Much worse. He shoves the torn shower-curtain aside when Lizzie returns, deciding the tub will be best for the peroxide cleaning. Holding her firmly by the wrist, he positions her arm just over the edge, and without warning, without giving her the benefit of at least using a rag, tilts the bottle, dumping the clear liquid along the length of her pale forearm. It bubbles and hisses, mixing with what little bits of blood are left. The chemical reaction earns a wince out of the recipient, even makes her so bold as to reach out and grasp the excess of Archy's sleeve with her uninjured hand. He acts like he doesn't notice, choosing instead to go about laying down the gauze, while Lizzie moves a roll of medical tape around said arm in a spiraling motion. He moves to the sink without looking at either of them, a frown pulling prominently at the corners of his lips. The crusty, old blood breaks free of his hand like it had just been sitting on the surface for decoration. \"Go sit in the living room.\" He says quietly, reaches for the peroxide bottle. The medicine makes contact with the exposed under layers of skin and tissue, licking at them like a diseased dog at his wounds; his eye brows don't even so much as twitch when it gives off its signature hiss. The living room is Abby's favorite in the flat. The large, wide windows allow enough light in during the day that electricity isn't needed. The couch cushions are almost as comfortable as her mattress, and the white paint and openness of the room give her a sense of sanctuary and fresh air, unlike the small, dark, closed-in room back at her old flat. But tonight, with the outside light seeming to dissipate more rapidly by the minute, the blinds drawn and closed, it feels like a cave...if not smaller. Archy and Lizzie walk into the living room side by side, expressions somber as they quietly exchange words to one another. They pause by the front door, every now and then sending a glance or two in the general direction of the girl. Five minutes go by before eventually, Archy reaches for the door knob, nodding gently as Lizzie sticks a foot outside. Abby watches curiously as she squeezes his upper arm, passing on a few more sentences, before making her exit. For a moment, he doesn't look at her when he sits opposite of her on the coffee table. He holds his left hand gently in his right, thumb stroking the bandage. She watches him, mouth opening and closing most of the time before she can get the words out. \"Well?\" She asks timidly. He looks at her from under his eyebrows, raising them shortly after. \"What?\" His voice is surprisingly gruff, not hostile, as Abby was expecting. She swallows tightly, looks down at her faded blue, blood-stained sneakers. \"Aren't you going to ask why I did it?\" He sighs, a heavily deep-drawn breath through his nose, and swallows too. \"Ask no questions, you hear no lies.\" He clears his throat. \"But, it was on my mind.\" The room is dead silent, save for the wall clock that ticks loudly. Abby envies it; apparently, even it's braver than she to allow its voice to be heard. She glances up at it, watching with the last tiny sliver of hope as the sun finally sets down behind the skyscrapers. \"You got somewhere to go?\" Archy asks, not seeming to care about the balance of silence he's just broken. He crosses his right leg over the left, entwines his fingers over the knee. \"Do you think he'd be happy with you, Abby?\" Tiny pinpricks behind her eyes begin to sting. She wraps her arms around herself, holds her legs tighter against each other. \"No.\" She whispers shakily. He holds his arms open, a gesture once thought to be warm, now seeming to mock her. \"Well? You seem to want to tell me why you did it.\" She squeezes her eyes shut, fighting the burning tears. One rebelliously trickles out and onto her left cheek, drawing a sharp breath out of her. \"I miss him...It suffocates me to think about him.\" He nods, brows raising again. \"Tell me how cutting yourself helps that...I'm not sure I understand that part.\" She takes a deep breath, wills herself to continue. \"Like I said: I feel like I'm being suffocated. A tea kettle boils water until steam is shooting out of the spout. That's exactly what I feel. I have to cut myself, in order for the steam to have an outlet.\" She can't stand the intensity of his gaze anymore, piercing her like individual knives. Again, she drops her head, only this time into her waiting palms. Archy places his hands on either side of his hips, looking off to the side as he sighs again. \"Lizzie and I had a talk,\" He states, his voice a little softer. The new tone draws Abby out of her hands, and he looks full-on at her as he speaks. \"We both agreed that...it might be best if you went away for a little while, took a bit of thera-\" \"No.\" She whispers firmly. She shakes her head, wondering where the boldness is coming from. \"No, I'm not going to therapy again...I refuse.\" \"Abby,\" He leans forward, voice dropping again. \"It'll help you. They can teach you ways to deal with your grief without-\" He looks at her bandaged arm uneasily, swallowing a little easier now as he recites his practiced lines, \"Without hurting yourself. You'll have people to talk to that have been through the same thi-\" Somewhere, she finds the energy deep within to shove herself angrily off the couch. \"No!\" She shouts, and even she's surprised at her bravado when her voice echoes off the walls. \"I'm not going!\" He stands, too, knocking the coffee table back. \"Yes you are!\" He yells. \"Don't mistake yourself in thinking you're the only one that misses him! It's a shame. It's a damned shame! But,\" He gestures aggressively at her arm, \"This isn't anyway to deal with it! He's dead, Abby! Got it? Dead. You go to that dirty stinkin' graveyard every night like you're visiting with someone that responds back ! You stay out late, you don't tell us when you're coming home.\" He flails his arms in the air, exasperated. \"I'm worried about you!\" Now he grabs her tightly by the shoulders, shakes them firmly. \"Do you understand that? You're not some orphan out on your own! You have family to come back to, however small it is!\" Abby tries to rip away from his grasp, only to have him irritatingly grab her by the excess of her right sleeve. She beats at his chest in a blind rage with her fists, able to see nothing but the color red. Enraged about getting caught. Enraged about being told what she's going to do. Enraged about someone speaking about her dad in such a manner. \"You're not my family!\" She screams. \"Family members don't keep secrets from one another, and they don't speak about the dead like some pet ! I hate you! I hate you!\" She ignores the pain in her left arm, disregards the fact that the bandages are being stained with scarlet. \"Do you understand that ? I . Hate. You !\" Archy stands quietly, taking his beating like he did only a year ago. Takes it for as long as he can bear it, anyway. In a swift move, he grabs her wrists, restrains them just enough to keep them from coming near his chest. Then, without question of what to do next, pulls her against him, wraps his arms tightly around her. She strikes at his back, her incoherent words muffled by his chest. Even after she stops struggling, he continues to hold her, afraid to let go. His right hand comes up to cradle the back of her head, strokes the wheat-colored threads as the other rubs soothing circles along the length of her back. \"Shhh, shhh. Abs, listen. Listen to me. It's for the best. I'm doing this because I love you.\" He murmurs, bending his head over hers. She grips handfuls of his coat, squeezes him tight enough that it squishes her nose. \"How can you claim to love me,\" She mumbles, \"If you're willing to send me away?\" He opens his mouth, pulls in a shaky breath. \"It's a serious matter, Abby. Things like this...they shouldn't be skirted.\" \"Yeah.\" She whispers. \"It is for the best. But,\" She lifts her head from his chest, allows him to tuck a stray strand of hair behind her ear. \"I'm not going without a fight. I'm awfully sorry about this-\" She swings hard against his stomach with her fist, makes a run for the door when he doubles over. He hobbles right behind her, hand clamped over his belly. He makes it to the bottom of the stairs before stopping, trying to regain his breath. \"Abby!\" He calls. It's too late. He catches a flurry of her figure behind the closing elevator doors. Mrs. Peters is waiting for him in the living room when he gets back, worry-lines prominent on her brow, eyes shining with concern. \"What's happened? What was all that yelling?\" She takes a moment to look at him, particularly noting his bent posture. \"Archy?\" He eases himself down on the couch with a grunt, crossing his ankles on the crooked coffee table as he closes his eyes. \"We had a disagreement,\" He winces, places his hands on his stomach. \"About rehabilitation.\" His brows quirk. \"She doesn't want to go.\" \"Disagreement, indeed.\" She mutters. \"Getting bashed in the gut isn't having a disagreement...It's having a fight.\" \"Well, I could hardly hit her back, could I?\" He snaps. \"Give it an hour. If she isn't back by then, I'll go looking for her.\" \"Fine, fine. I'll put on a kettle. Call Turbo, would you? I want him here with the car as soon as possible.\" He nods. \"Right. Will do.\" He raises his brows, watches her retreating form. \"Oh, and Mrs. Peters? I'll have a beer.\" She wonders about the intelligence of her decision as she drags herself down the sidewalk, sleeves rolled down to her thumbs. Crying doesn't seem to phase him. Hitting him didn't phase him. What good is running away going to do? Not running away, she reminds herself, Just taking a walk. \"But, how long of a walk? How far ?\" She responds to herself. She catches the whiff of a cigarette in passing, stops to stare in longing. After a moment, she follows them at a brisk pace. \"Uhm, 'scuse me, sir?\" The man turns. He's hardly any older than she is, mussed up hair, hasn't shaved in a few days. \"Speakin' to me?\" She bows her head a little, rubs the back of her neck. \"Yeah. Uhm...Could you spare me a cigarette?\" The stranger's brows arch. He takes the cancer stick out of his mouth, studies her with disturbing interest. \"Forget the cig, sweetheart. You look like you need a drink .\" He looks over his shoulder, yanks a thumb in the same direction. \"I'm on me way to the pub. Care to join me?\" She gives him a half-hearted chuckle. \"No, but thanks very much. Just had an argument with my uncle, is all. I'm going to go back to him after a cigarette, if that's alright with you.\" The young man's shoulders slouch a little, but he nods. \"Alright, sweetheart. But, you're missing out on a good time.\" He winks. \"I could bring you a smile, or two.\" She winks back, taking the offered smoke. \"You already have, mister.\" With a neat little smirk, she leans in close, close enough to make him uncomfortable, and lights her cigarette on his. He grins, leaning back in amusement. \"Are you sure you don't want to come with me to the pub?\" She laughs, slowly leaning next to his face to grab another cig. \"No, but I appreciate the offer.\" Turning, she sends him one last flirty smile, before walking off. She'd quit smoking a year ago, vowing she'd never touch another cancer stick. But after tonight...What more is one more broken promise going to hurt? Promise to Richie to never cut herself again. Promise to stay off of cigarettes. Promise to herself to treat Archy with the utmost respect for taking her in. Cancer stick, she muses. That's why she'd quit. Too many family members, friends of the family were dying off from lung disease, or other such causes of smoking. It's not like the box doesn't come with a warning label. But, oh , how it feels good. She takes in a nice, deep breath, feels the smoke travel down her windpipe, spread out into her lungs, before blowing out the excess. A moment later, the nicotine kicks in, causing her steps to become unsteady, her body wanting to go this way, while she wants to go that way. She laughs, carelessly, openly to the empty streets, tucking the other cig behind her left ear. She can't say she wasn't expecting any side-effects after not touching one in a year . One cigarette smoked down to the filter, she uses it to light the other, deciding to walk just a little bit longer. She goes across a bridge without noticing, around a pond without hearing the ducks quack. Soon, it's been half an hour, and still, she walks. She's surprised at how few the people have been in all this time, how shady they look when someone does pass her. She begins to go across the bridge again, nerves and smarts nagging at her. \"You speak to me like that again, and I'll kill you without thinking twice!\" What did he say? She stops, tip-toes back to the beginning of the bridge. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Cole! I didn't mean-\" Cole? Lenny Cole? Isn't that who Archy works f- \"You almost exposed me, you understand that? You should know not to deal with unfamiliar customers!\" \"Honestly, Mr. Cole! I didn't know! You don't just have us deal to street scum, we deal to gentlemen, too! Crooked cops, for Pete's sake!\" She gets down on her hands and knees, scoots just to the edge of the steps. It is Mr. Cole! But what's he doing?\" \"You never sell to a gentleman we haven't done a background check on! How stupid are you, you f-\" I knew that man didn't work in real-estate! She shakes her head, inches down a couple more stairs. \"Immigrant? Danny, shoot 'im before I have a heart attack! This stupid bastard is of no more use! Go on, then, shoot him!\" Lenny barks. A man, Danny , apparently, steps out of the four-man crowd of thugs, silenced-pistol in hand. He aims it at the offender without blinking. \"No! No! I won't do it ag-\" Click. Click click...click. The man is thrown back against the brick arch of the bridge, slumping down to his back-side in what's left of dried creak scum, bird waste, feathers and dead leaves. Abby can't see the man's face, can't see his soul leaving his eyes, or his slack jaw swinging by the hinges, dangling just above his shoulder. She did, however, see a man fire a gun, and another one die after a violent jig, which is just as good. A shriek projects involuntarily over her tongue, past her teeth before she can clamp a hand over her mouth. The accidental outburst draws the attention of the rough crowd (including a certain man dressed in all black, from his fedora, tie, even down to his socks and shoes). For a minute, they just stare at her, their pupils adjusting as though they've just remembered they were out in public, with the danger (fulfilled, now), of being caught. Abby stares, too, the lines and details of each individual face being burned into her memory...the faces of people that very well might just kill her. Lenny's momentary shock is hidden behind his sunglasses (even worn at night, apparently). The girl's face won't go unremembered by his memory, either, having realized just who has caught him in the act. He pretends not to recognize her, for the benefit of the end of the situation, or for his image in front of the men on his payroll, he doesn't know. \"What the f-\" Oh, sh- \"-Are you staring at?\" Panicked, she trips up the stairs a few times, scrapes her chin a few good ones, before making it back up to the bridge. She can hear Lenny shouting beneath her feet, hear him goading the men to chase after her, before he has them shot, too. The men are on her in a heartbeat, a pack of hounds after a fox. By-standers pause to see what all the noise is about. She looks at them with frantic eyes, flails her arms wildly as she leaps just in time to avoid tripping over a branch. \"Help me!\" She calls to them. \" Help! \" None oblige. She notes a patch of trees, planted in neat rows, just a few yards before the sidewalk and a major street. Heart in her throat, she heads for the patch, runs a zig-zag pattern between them. Someone's fingers brush the base of her neck, begin to grab the excess of her shirt collar. Terrified, Abby brushes shoulders with one of the trees, successfully knocking the man's face into it. He falls to the ground with blood spattered across his broken nose, crooked for the rest of his life. She chances a glance over her shoulder. Two more people pursue her. Two? I thought there were- Her legs connect with a park bench, breaking the two top-most boards of the back support. She flings her arms in front of her face, managing to make her elbows crack against the seat instead of her chin. She groans unashamedly in the middle of the sidewalk, rolls over onto her side to cradle her right arm against her. \"Ooh!\" \"That's gotta hurt ...\" \"Is she alright?\" \"She may need to go to the hospital! Someone check on her.\" A ginger, perhaps in her fifties, kneels over her, molds a hand around the ball of her shoulder. \"Are you alright, dear? You took quite a-\" \"Those men!\" She breathes. \"I'm being chased! I-\" \"Chased? Someone's chasing her?\" \"Who's being chased? Do they have guns?\" \"Who has a gun?\" A bobby and his partner make their way gently through the crowd. \"What's this about a gun, I hear?\" The first one, raven-haired, addresses the people. The ginger looks up at them. \"This girl says she was being chased-\" \"By who?\" The partner, a short black woman, asks. Abby carefully eases herself to a sitting position, arm still cradled tightly against her. The two men are nowhere to be seen. \"I-...I don't know who they were. I...\" She pauses. \"They were trying to rob me.\" Her stomach tightens. Rob you? What are you lying to the police for? The black bobby eases herself to a squatting position, takes out a notepad. Her partner begins to question the crowd. \"What did these men look like, dear? What were they trying to get from you?\" \"Uhm...\" She glances around again. \"My mobile. They were watching me speak into it. When I put it away, they came around and asked for it. I couldn't really see their faces...All I know is that they were wearing black.\" \"And this happened just now?\" She nods. \"Mhm.\" \"Are you alright? Do you need a lift to the hospital?\" \"No, but-\" It's him. Just leaning there against the lamp post, watching the scene with amusement. Black fedora and tie, socks and shoes. His eyes remind her of Charlie's: brilliant blue, incredibly observant. He smiles at her, points his fingers at his eyes, then hers. Before Abby can warn the policewoman, he's gone. \"I think I did something to my leg. Could you help me get home?\" \"You be safe, now. Hear me, Archy? I don't want to be getting any phone calls that you're in hospital, too, if she isn't already.\" Archy checks the magazine of his pistol. He's taking the more favored of his collection: a silver magnum, given to him by Lenny as a reward for his first job done well. Nodding, he slips the magazine back into the chamber. \"As always, Mrs. Peters. Call me if she comes back, alright?\" She nods, pats Turbo on the shoulder. \"Take care of him, will you, Turbo?\" He smiles. \"Yes, ma'm. Always, ma'm.\" \"Alright, Turbo. Loaded? Ready to-\" A buzzer sounds at the front door. Archy picks up the phone, brows knotted. \"Hello?\" \"Mister Crackit? Mister Archibald Crackit?\" He frowns. No one calls him Archibald anymore. Not unless they're officials. \"Speaking.\" \"Mister Crackit, this is Officer Peak. We have a young lady down here that says she's your niece. A one...Abigail Crackit?\" He turns to look at Turbo, then Mrs. Peters, who breathes a sigh of relief. \"Yes, that's her. Want me to come down, or-\" \"No, no, that's fine. We'd like to have a word. Nothing serious, just a short chat.\" He breathes a sigh out of his nose, nods. \"That'll be fine, thanks...Come up.\" The policewoman smiles at him when he opens the door, keeps a hand gently on Abby's shoulder. The raven-haired officer just nods...curtly. Abby's relieved to see that he doesn't look angry. More so, he looks relieved. \"I hope there wasn't any trouble.\" He says quietly, hiding the magnum behind him. The woman smiles. \"No, no. Your niece isn't the center of any mischief. Rather, she was the victim.\" Abby avoids his gaze, looks at the woman when she removes her hand. \"May I go, please?\" She doesn't waste any time when she receives a nod, ducks beneath Archy's arm as he holds the door open. She doesn't listen to the details the police give him. She barely feels Mrs. Peters smother her with a hug only a mother can give. She almost doesn't register the nod sent her direction by Turbo. All she knows at this point is the pain in both arms, embarrassment at having to be brought home like a teenager caught toilet-papering on halloween night. \"You've scraped your chin! And your arm is bleeding.\" Mrs. Peters fusses. \"I'm fine.\" Abby says weakly. \"I just...I just need to lay down.\" \"Well, at least let me-\" \"Mrs. Peters.\" Her voice is soft. Firm, albeit, but not irritated. \"It's noting I can't take care of. I'm going to my room, now. Thank you.\" Her bed . Her bed has never felt this good. Tempur-pedic? Please. Now laying on her back, she can feel the stress of the day, the torturous, emotional events taking a toll on her body. There isn't a single part of her that doesn't hurt. She strips off her blood-stained shirt, groans as she replaces it with the black tank-top laying wadded at the end of the bed. She opens the blinds to allow the street light to shine in, effectively illuminating the room. The bandages on her left arm look absolutely disgusting. Her right arm has already begun to turn black. This isn't release...This is morality turning around to punish her for self-mutilation. She jumps when someone knocks on the door. Flustered, she doesn't respond, waiting instead for it to open. Archy pokes his head in after a moment, pulls her into a rough hug after the door slams behind him. After tonight's events, his hug only hurts, but she doesn't care. She hugs him with fervor just as equal, inhales his cologne that isn't too strong, yet definitely masculine. Which is also why it surprises her when he shoves her away after a minute. \"Don't you ever, ever run off like that again.\" He scolds, squeezing her shoulder as he waves a finger in her face. \"Do you understand? Do you have any-\" He stops, shakes his head. \"No, you don't. You have no idea how worried I was. And when the police showed up-\" She throws her arms around him again, nearly sending the both of them careening backwards. It surprises her at how much comfort she gets out of just being around him, now. Inhaling his scent, hearing his voice, even if it's chastising. She hugs him all the more tighter, wincing at her throbbing right arm. \"I'm sorry I hit you.\" She mumbles against his chest. \"And I'm sorry I ran off. You must have been sick about the whole thing.\" Surprised, it takes him a moment to hug her back. He slowly snakes his arms around her, strokes her hair. \"Do you remember what those men looked like?\" \"No. It was dark...I couldn't see much of anything.\" She looks up at him, rests her chin on his chest. \"I'm sorry.\" She whispers. \"I'm so sorry.\" He rubs her back with a sigh, cups her shoulders as he looks at the window, then her eyes. \"You're safe-\" Not for long... \"That's all I care about.\" With one final squeeze to her shoulders, he releases her from his arms, walks slowly to the door. \"Get some sleep. I'll have Lizzie look at your arm tomorrow...And we need to have a talk.\" He stares at her seriously, allows the door to break his gaze. She goes directly to her mobile when his footsteps recede, allows the tears to flow unchecked while the connection goes through. \"Charlie? We need to talk.\" A Glance Into the Author's Mind: Symbolism: Talking Straight Razor : The devil.

Let me know![Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I do not own anything pertaining to RocknRolla, aside from characters and plot unoriginal to the movie. Thank you. Special Author's Note: Chapter dedicated to G.G. Blythe . I'm sorry. The flat is very quiet. Though, if the polished floors and fresh smell of lemon-scent are clue enough, he'd guess Mrs. Peters has finished her work for the day, most likely gone out for a bit; the note he finds taped to the back of the door confirms his suspicions. He wads it up quietly, drops it in the bin in passing to the kitchen sink. Days like these aren't often. Not unexpected, but definitely limited. A groan caresses his throat as he leans all of his weight on his hands, taking a moment to stare through the window. Out of doors, even the booming city seems to be taking a rest. He notes, without any special interest, that there seem to be less lights on in the office buildings. Few cars pass by the flat, and even fewer taxies honk their horns in the distance. Lenny had been in a foul mood today. Not that it's hard to push him into one. Archy snorts, grabs a shot-glass from the cabinet on the left, a bottle of whiskey from the one on the right. The burn feels good, for once, scorches him straight down to the belly. He pours another one, studies how the moonlight seems to bathe the balcony in a unique shade of blue. He's known Lenny for a good portion of his life. He'd been a much younger man when he'd decided to follow him in his crooked deals...young, desperate for employment...naïve. He grabs a larger glass from the cabinet on the left. After all this time, though, after everything he's seen, the people he's met...Lenny remains to be the only one he can't always predict...Like when the old clam forced him to agree to something at work today that he very much didn't want to do. \" ...Danny, hose him down!\" It's not something he isn't used to seeing. When you work for Lenny, torture and death become everyday things. Besides, it isn't like they haven't used the old crayfish trick several dozen times. That being said, it doesn't really faze Archy to see the young, raven-haired man suspended from a hook, dripping wet with nothing but two flimsy leather straps holding him to a normal dining room chair. He watches the man cough and sputter, inhales the fear reeking off of him in waves. Lenny removes the man's gag with a surprising gentleness for a man of his character, only to reprise the role when he flicks the excess water of the River Thames from his fingers in disgust. \"Right.\" He says, a bit of his disdain showing through. \"Who's got that painting? One name.\" The man sputters again, his earlier anger gone as he looks his captor in the eyes. \"Johnny. Johnny Quid! The singer from the group...the...The Quid Lickers!\" Lenny stares at him with a slack jaw, searching his face for any trace of jest. He looks at Danny, too, somewhat like the deaf newcomer asking the translator to help them understand. \"This hasn't worked, has it?\" The man is a ticking time bomb, Archy knows. He can't show it here, but hope starts to blossom in the back of his mind. Nothing kills that junkie. Nothing. He rubs his chin, stares at the kidnaped again. \" How can a dead man sell you a painting?\" The accusation seems to flip a survival switch on in the young man's head. He begins to struggle again, flailing his hands around as much as he can beneath the leather straps. \"No no no no! He's not dead! I know he's not dead, because he tried selling us that painting, and he changed his mind at the last minute! He got like, an obsession with it, or something!\" Lenny shatters his mug on the harsh concrete of the warehouse, out of rage that his infectious step-son is still alive, or that it's Johnny that's robbed him, Archy can't tell. \"Oh, for f-\" It's the former, he knows it. Excitement bubbles up into his face, and he can't decide which direction to look. Should he listen to the annoying groveling of someone that was just in contact with the junkie, or should he listen to the boss's anger for clues? \" Sake! Archy! Put him back in before I shoot him!\" \" No! Please!\" The man sputters. \"I was interested! I wanted the painting, but like I said, he's got an obsession with it! He said he was going to take it out of the city...I dunno, maybe as far as Scotland, to find a more worthy buyer! Believe me! I know who he is! We went to school together! I wouldn't lie to you! I'd never lie to you! I don't lie! I've never lied in my life! I wouldn't lie to you! Now please, just let me go! I don't wanna get...\" Emotions get the better of him. He doesn't care if it's blackmail, he breaks down into sobs, openly. Archy turns to Lenny, certain now. \"Len, can I have a word?\" He walks briskly in front of the older man, unable to get away from the group of thugs fast enough. He isn't going to like it, he knows it. At least that's one of the things he can predict about Lenny: he doesn't like any mention of Johnny...in any way, shape, or form. He waits for him to light up a cigar, using what little precious time he's got to muster up the question. \"Your boy ain't dead, is he?\" He spits out. Lenny whirls on him, practically throwing the lighter back in his pocket. \"Don't you dare call him my boy!\" \" Oh, you know what I mean!\" He grumbles, tossing his head as he claws for the words. \"Your...your...Ex's boy, your step-son! He had a set of keys to the house, didn't he?\" \" He just won't die, that cockroach!\" Archy can't keep his eyes from narrowing in irritation. Whenever Lenny wasn't there for Johnny (which was most of the time), Archy was. Yes, he's had to clean up for the boy's mouth, he's had to knock him around a few times. Still, this is someone that's become integrated family. He gnaws at his lower lip for a moment, stares at the condiments set out on the table. \" That junkie's seen more funerals than an undertaker! He's poison, I tell ya. The next world war will have his name written all over it.\" He takes a deep breath, wipes his nose as he seems to remember, he isn't speaking to Johnny, he's speaking to Archy, his right hand man, loyal friend...practically a son. \"Look,\" he murmurs, reining himself in, \"Go see if you can find out who he knows in Scotland. In fact, why don't you go see if you can find those two flash idiots that were his managers. What were their names?\" He shakes his hands, shuffles his feet as though the motions will help his fraying mind. \"Greek, and...Minnie.\" Archy rolls his eyes, allows his irritation to knot his brows together. \"Roman and Mickey.\" Lenny nods. \"Yeah, whatever. Because, if anyone can find that smoking crack pipe's connections, they can.\" He looks down at the ground, purses his lips. \"And I'll need you to do me a favor, Arch...If we can find his connections, I'll need you to go after him...Maybe as soon as tonight.\" He straightens, allows his hand to flop from the table to his side. \"What, you mean Scotland?\" Lenny looks at him over the frames of his glasses, an expression he usually reserves for the subordinates. \"No, Disneyland. Of course I mean Scotland! You been drinking the same water as Bandy?\" He tosses his head again, rubs the back of his neck.\"I dunno, Len.\" He says quietly.\"Abby's bruised up pretty bad. I'm not sure I want to be so far away from her just yet.\" The mention of Abby draws an odd reaction out of the man...the second time, now that Archy thinks about it. He seems to hold his head up a little higher, walks a little closer to Archy as he eases his cigar onto the edge of the ashtray. \"What's that, then? What's happened to her?\" He swallows a little harder, stares at his feet for a moment, before deciding to look into the shades-covered eyes. \"Some muggers tried to steal her mobile-\" Lenny shoves the shades higher up on his nose. So, she hasn't snitched after all? He smiles inwardly. No. If she had ratted him out, Archy would have confronted him, by now. He smiles inwardly, listening but not focusing on Archy's words as he, too, leans his weight on the table. \"Well, that is...unfortunate, Arch,\" He states solemnly (though there's an odd, upbeat tone to his solemness), \"But...I really do need you to do this job.\" Archy chews on the inside of his cheek, shakes his head as he watches the men lower Johnny's classmate back into the river...where they won't hoist him back out until they're sure he's drowned...after which, they'll raise him one more time, only to empty the contents of the chair for the next victim. \"I'm sorry, Len. This may be one instance in which...\" He sighs, brining his conflicted eyes back to the man, \"I may just have to tell you no, and deal with the consequences later.\" He waits for a moment, scratches the bridge of his nose, before lowering his voice. \"We share the same blood, Len. I gotta take care of her.\" \" And you can,\" Lenny states cheerfully, \"When you get back from this little...errand. Look,\" He leans closer to his right hand man, cigar positioned and smoking between their chests, \"This is Johnny that's stolen this painting...A painting that belongs to a client . Do you really want me to send someone else after him? Someone that doesn't have near as much patience as you, Arch?\" Now he grits his teeth. He knew this card was coming...he just hoped above hope it wouldn't be used against him. Lenny knows Archy. He knows how he feels about the boy, and he knows he wouldn't kill him...not in his right mind, anyway. \" Besides,\" He cuts in, interrupting the train of thought, \"If you're really that concerned about your niece, I could have one of the boys pop around to check on her.\" He straightens, cigar lowering to their waists. \"Hm? How do you feel about that? I could have Bandy check up on your girl, and Mrs. Peters.\" This earns a quirk from Archy's brows. \"Bandy?\" He says, deflated. \"I dunno, Len. Dunno if I trust her with someone like Bandy.\" He chances a look at said person...just in time to witness him getting his thumb pinched by one of the crayfish they keep on display for intimidation. \"Bandy wouldn't know what to do with a lady of the pole ; why should he be able to check up on a poorly teenage girl?\" Lenny sticks the cigar between his teeth, chuckling. \"It doesn't have to be Bandy...What about...What about Danny? You trust him, don't you?\" \" I was going to take Danny to Scotland.\" \" What, to go on a nice little holiday with you, is it? You're taking Turbo.\" He says flippantly. \"Remember who you're going after; Turbo will do just fine if you need any manpower. Now,\" he pushes away from the table, gears already at work, \"Go find those two flash idiot managers of his...that should give you a good enough start.\" He feels numb. The alcohol that once scorched him isn't enough anymore. He sucks harder at the liquid, draining the last drop until the squares of ice slide forward and rub his upper lip, deciding it may be more beneficial to drink straight from the bottle instead. It's days like these that he wonders why he's still in the business. What else would you do? His mind sneers. The only laws you respect are the ones set up by Lenny. School drop-outs don't get anywhere. He stumbles to the kitchen table as his fingers start to tingle, mind fuzzy. Where did it all- An annoying buzzing sound breaks the silence, startling him out of the gloom. He sits for a moment, brows drawn as he cranes his neck to search the area around him, irritation mounting before he realizes...Someone's at the front door. He sighs shakily, balancing his weight cautiously from foot to foot, every now and then throwing his arms away from his body to keep upright. He places his left hand against the doorframe, leaning his weight heavily on it before grasping the doorknob, pulling the tall piece of wood towards him. He's caught off-guard by Lizzie's appearance on his doorstep, straight from work, apparently. Her long, yellow hair is tied back neatly from her face, hairband resting lightly against her nape to allow her wavy mane to sway gently between her shoulder-blades. She's dressed simply in a pair of teal-colored scrubs, awfully clean, he thinks, for a trauma surgeon, with a black overcoat and purse draped over her left arm. Her feet are adorned in a rather new looking pair of pink and silver sneakers, which shift slightly as he takes her in. Hand still resting on the doorknob, just enough space between the frame and entryway for his head, he simply stares at her, blinking a little harder than normal. \"Hey.\" He slurs softly. If she's uncomfortable by his inspection, the only clue is a slight, barely noticeable twitch of her eyebrows. \"Arch.\" She says slowly. Her eyes flick down to their feet, off to the side as she rocks from the balls of her feet to the heels, then back again. \"Are we going to stand here all night, or, are you going to let me in?\" Her brows raise expectantly, before she stands on her toes to look over his shoulder. \"Have you got company?\" He continues staring at her for a moment, shaking his head...listlessly. \"No, no. Come in.\" He practically whispers, takes her coat and purse to hang them on the coat-rack not far from the door. Lizzie stands in the doorway for a moment, head cocked to the right, brows furrowed as she watches his sluggish movements. \"Everything alright, Arch?\" She sticks her head reluctantly into the room, surveying the empty furniture, the cut-off lights...the bottle of whiskey resting three-fourths empty on the kitchen table. She doesn't take her time walking in, now, closing the door hastily behind her. \"What's happened? What's going on?\" The slowness of his brows would be comical if the situation wasn't so concerning. Archy never gets drunk during a week day...not unless something very bad has happened. He tilts his head to the left, shoves his hands in his pockets. \"Good as gold.\" He mutters. \"No-...Nuffin's 'appened.\" He narrows his eyes at her, holding a shaky left hand in the direction of the kitchen. \"Would you like...a glass of wine?\" She's the one staring, now, right brow cocked, left flattened over her eye as her jaw hangs slightly down from her upper lip. She shakes her head slowly, cups his cheeks, gently pulls the skin beneath his eyes down to frown into his pupils. \"You're drunk.\" \"Tipsy.\" He corrects. \"Nuffin but tipsy.\" \"You're buzzed.\" She scowls. \"The law has a tendency to consider buzzed as drunk.\" She takes him by the hand, leads him outside onto the balcony, unceremoniously shoves him down onto the padded wire love-seat. \"What time does Abby get home?\" She stops again, angles her chin down to look him directly in the face. \"She is coming home, right? She's not out getting hurt? Not holed up in her room because you're drinking?\" He yanks his mobile out of his pocket, squints at the screen. \"She sent me...she sent me a text...sev-...several hours ago.\" She waits, throws her hands out expectantly. \"Well? Did she say where she was? When she's coming back? Is she coming back?\" He shrugs, weight leaning particularly to the left...against the armrest. \"Didn-...Didn' say.\" Lizzie shakes her head irritably, shifts her weight to the right foot so that her hip juts out. \"Really, Arch. You call yourself a guardian? Text her and ask her when she's coming home.\" She pauses for a moment, tosses her head. \"Better yet,\" She says, taking the mobile from his loose fingers, \"Let me ask. I can't imagine you can text legibly in this state.\" She frowns at him again, thumbs moving across the keys in a blur...to his eyes. Handing the phone back to him, she turns toward the door. \"You stay out here, in the fresh air, if it can be called so, and don't move, until I get back.\" She waits for him to nod, before disappearing into the flat as a sudden burst of light shines through the kitchen window. He doesn't know when she came back out, only that a steaming cup of coffee is placed unexpectedly in his hands, a glass of water and plate of bread slices on the small stand next to him. \"Drink those, eat that.\" She sighs, visibly calmer as she lays a cool cloth across his forehead. She would find him like this a lot after he got out of prison, especially the first couple of months. She hides a wince as she watches him sip his coffee, folds her left leg beneath the right as she laces her fingers together in her lap. His actions after being in the slammer, his different mannerisms, his sudden temper flares, the seemingly mechanical touches and words, even during the intimate times, all adding up to their break-up. She shakes her head again, taking the mobile from his lap when the screen lights up, chirping sound announcing the arrival of a new text. \"She's still at the friend's house,\" She says, a note of approval in her voice, \"And she wants to know if she can stay for a few more hours.\" He reaches for a slice of bread, nodding as half of it disappears. She sends the corresponding message, leans across him to lay the mobile next to the plate of bread. She's surprised when a heavy arm drapes across her shoulders, pulls her to the warm, muscly body next to her when she tries to straighten again, pinning her awkwardly against his side, head beneath his chin. \"Arch,\" She says slowly, \"What are you doing?\" Said person remains motionless, save for another drag of coffee. The mug clinks loudly against the small table when he polishes off the deep brown liquid, damp cloth joining it silently. He leans his head back, staring up at a nearly cloud-consumed moon. \"Do you 'fink I'm cut out for this sor' of 'fing?\" The vulnerability in his voice, the softness of it, makes her look quickly up at him, neck straining from her awkward position. She pushes back from him, allowing his arm to drop to her waist as he continues to stare up at the sky. \"What do you mean?\" His chin drops swiftly, head lolling sloppily in her direction. \"You know, this...\" His left hand waves lazily in the air, a crooked circle next to his head, \"Parenting 'fing. I...\" His brows crease sadly, lips pulling down in a frown, \"Where did I go wrong? Why doesn't she trust me?\" She stares at him for a moment, sighs as she places the cool cloth on his forehead again. \"You haven't gone wrong, Arch.\" She says gently, hand resting limply across the cloth to keep it in place. \"These are problems she's had for a while, now. That much is obvious to you, isn't it?\" He blinks a few times, nods as he adjusts his arm to rest his hand on her hip. \"I should have noticed sooner, I should have watched closer-\" A single finger comes to rest on his lips, startling him into silence. \"Shhh.\" She leans a little closer, not without knowing the waters she dangerously decides to tread in as she turns his face toward her by the chin. \"Don't do this to yourself, Archy. You're just going to end up hurting both parties. You're doing what you can with the information that you have. You caught her in the act, which is good. You got her to tell you what the problem is, which is even better. We'll sit her down tonight, and we'll explain the benefits of professional help.\" She arches her brows, tilts her chin down. \"Alright? It's not your fault. She'll be okay.\" He nods, cups her smaller right hand in his left, examining and holding the fingers like one would when buying a glass figurine. \"I've missed you.\" He murmurs huskily, eyes flicking to hers. She holds his gaze for a moment, suddenly realizing how hard it is to breathe, how close he is. Sighing, she gently slips her fingers from his, untangles herself from his half embrace. \"I don't want her to see you like this when she gets home.\" She mumbles, heading for the kitchen again. \"Drink some of that water, Arch...I'll make some more coffee.\" She's surprised that he was able to do all of this work by himself. The walls, a boring shade of milk-white before, now proudly sport a nice shade of dark blue. The trim on the windows decidedly, quite fittingly, stayed white, while the carpet changed to a nice, light shade of aqua blue. She feels bad that he did it because they used to make fun of him, used to remind him constantly that his place of chill, study and sleep looked like a hospital room. Then again, if they hadn't, it would still be that way. She crosses her feet at the ankles, leans against the wall to view out the nearest window, completely lost in a world all her own. Her right arm, despite all the deep gashes in the left arm from her tirade, throbs painfully with each heartbeat, making her wear a continuous wince. Since last night, it's turned completely jet black between the wrist and the elbow, deep violet across the top of the hand, and slightly crimson across the knuckles and fingers. The left arm, the lacerates, continue to weep a translucent pus, some a cloudy shade, while others don't cry at all. She holds them delicately against her body, watching the odd passerby, the malfunction of one of the street lamps, the bulb flickering on and off within every minute. \"Doesn't that lamp bother you?\" She says, absent-minded. Charlie snorts, shakes his head, while Jess scoffs. \"Would you stay focused?\" She scolds. \"That's the third time I've asked you a question without getting the correct response.\" She turns from the window, drinking in her friends. Charlie, he who doesn't care who thinks what about him, sits lethargically in his desk chair, the only things adorning his body being his black boxer-shorts with the logos of superheroes on them (both Marvel and DC ), and a white tank-top. His right hand hangs limply from the edge of his desk, the other slung over the side of his chair. Jess sits on the floor, slouched down with her legs crossed, a notepad in her lap. \"I'm sorry,\" She says for the third time of the night, \"What did you ask me?\" Jess rolls her eyes, hoists a pink pen over the paper. \"Why don't you just go to the police? Tell them what really happened, about what you really saw. It would make you feel a lot better.\" Abby shakes her head, deciding to fold her legs beneath her on Charlie's unkept bed. \"Because my uncle works for the man. If I rat out Lenny, ultimately, I'll be ratting out Archy.\" \"The man's a crook, isn't he?\" Charlie throws carelessly in her direction. \"He works for one. He could be guilty of the exact same crimes.\" She glares at him from her three-foot radius of the desk, crossing her arms gingerly. \"Don't you think I've thought of that, Charlie?\" Jess closes the notebook, sets it aside as she joins her friend on the bed. \"...And you're still comfortable with living with the guy?\" She heaves out a sigh, lowers herself to a laying position to rest her head on the pillow. \"He's all I've got, as far as family goes.\" Charlie allows a moment to pass, sits up to lean in the direction of the girls. \"You could always stay with me-\" \"Shut up, Charlie!\" Jess snaps. \"This is serious!\" He puts his hands up in defense, leaning back again. \"I'm just trying to lighten the mood! You're taking a theatre class! Haven't they taught you anything about comic-relief, yet?\" He turns to his desk, deciding to doodle on a spare piece of paper. Jess lays a hand on her friend's shoulder, joining her in a laying position. \"So, what are you going to do?\" Abby shakes her head, curls into fetal position. \"I don't know...One thing's for certain...I'll really have to watch my back.\" Her mobile vibrates from the back pocket of her jeans, startling her. She only stares at the screen for a moment, sighing as she lays it on the floor. \"He wants me to come home...He thinks it's getting too late for me to be out.\" Charlie glances up at the Green Lantern clock above his desk, nodding as he folds up the doodle. \"Quite right, he is. We can finish up our meeting tomorrow.\" He looks over at the cuddled-up girls, sighing. \"Are you going to be alright? You want me to camp out on your balcony?\" She remains still for a moment, shaking her head as she untangles herself from Jess's limbs. \"No. That would just make Archy and Mrs. Peters suspicious.\" She pauses, bends down to pick up her jacket. \"Besides, I don't know how my uncle feels about boys just yet. I don't want him to take on the role of the protective father.\" She quirks her brows in the lad's direction. \"And if you ask me, he'd be the type that would be cleaning his gun if he knew you were about to walk through the door.\" He shoots a crooked grin in her direction, grabbing a wadded up pair of jeans from the floor. \"Any smart man would be protective while I'm around his kid.\" A pillow hits him in the face from Jess's direction. They climb into Jess's black Volvo once Charlie is completely dressed, their things collected and thrown in the back seat. The drive isn't a very long one at all, much shorter than Abby would have liked given the circumstances. She stares at the front steps bravely, her stomach beginning to fold itself into knots. \"I'd better get up there.\" She says quietly, though she makes no move to get out of the passenger seat. A gentle hand comes to rest on her shoulder from the driver's side, a larger one from the backseat. \"You want us to come with you?\" Jess asks. She shakes her head, reaching slowly for the door-handle. \"I'll...I'll be okay. See you guys tomorrow.\" Her feet drag as she makes her way to the door, turning twice to look at her friends. \"You sure you don't want us to come with you?\" Charlie asks, now in the passenger side. She swallows, nods once as she shuts the door behind her. The air is automatically thicker when she steps inside the dreaded flat, a single light shining on a pair of people sitting at the kitchen table. Three seconds and I already feel like I'm about to be given the third degree. She nods at them on her way to her room. \"Abby.\" Lizzie calls quietly. Fudge . Her feet root to the spot, arms stiff at her sides, fists balled up against her thighs. \"Yes?\" She squeaks. \"Do you have a moment? Want to come sit down with us?\" No. I don't want to be anywhere near this building, let alone sit at the same table. She rotates mechanically in place, forces her feet to move forward. She composes her face into an emotionless mask, easing herself onto the chair like one hundred needles already occupy it. \"Yes?\" She whispers, keeping her head down. Archy sits at the head of the table, posture doubled over so his elbows rest against his knees. His chest is nearly touching the table, and there's an odd sort of redness just beneath his eyes and in his cheeks. Lizzie leans against the back of her chair, somehow still straight and proper with her legs crossed. \"Abby,\" Lizzie starts, an out of place cheerfulness in her voice, \"Your uncle and I had a discussion-\" \"How long has this been going on?\" Archy demands, sitting up. It takes everything in her not to furrow her brows at the man. He seems weirdly unstable from his position across from her, an obvious determination to keep his face set a specific way in his eyes. She slouches down a little, folds her hands in her lap. \"I did it for a little while after mum died.\" She says timidly, and she doesn't miss the look in his eyes at the mention of her mother. She can't quite place it... \"You've been doing this since you were a child?\" Lizzie asks, tilting her head forward. She shakes her head, still staring at Archy before directing her gaze to her hands. He looks like a time bomb... \"No. It started when I turned twelve. You know, awkward stage, stuff developing, things changing inside of me. I had to rely on my best friend's mother to tell me what was going on. God knows dad wouldn't have told me everything I needed to know.\" Her cheeks flush a brilliant red, eyes not daring to go anywhere near the Archy's direction. \"You've been doing this for four years?\" Archy exclaims, a hint of anger in his voice. Lizzie lays a hand on his forearm, whispering something incomprehensible when the teen seems to shrink down a little more. \"N-no.\" She whispers. \"D- \"Sit up and look at us while you're talking.\" She shrinks even more, almost bent over in her chair, now, flinching at his voice. \"Archy.\" Lizzie scolds. His head snaps in her direction. \"What?\" \"You're scaring her.\" The statement seems to have an odd affect on him. He also seems to recede within himself, like his niece, crossing his legs as he sighs. \"Go on.\" He mumbles. She looks reluctantly at him, then Lizzie. \"Dad caught me in the act about a year after it started. He had a blow-up moment like you, Uncle, just take your anger and replace it with sadness. He talked to me about the way I'm talking to you, now...and it was a lot worse than getting screamed at.\" She sighs, rests her fists against her cheeks. \"I would have loved it if he'd have yelled at me. He never would...I can't ever recall him yelling at mum, either.\" Lizzie allows a moment of silence to pass, uncrossing her legs to cross them at the ankles. \"He wasn't one for shouting.\" She assures. Abby shakes her head. \"No. No, he wasn't.\" Archy watches her for a moment, laces his fingers on the tabletop. \"I don't...understand, why you feel you can't come and talk to me. Mrs. Peters is always here, Lizzie's available after work.\" He shakes his head. \"Why couldn't you talk to them?\" Lizzie glances between the two. \"What your uncle is trying to say, is-\" \"Why didn't you tell anyone?\" The question comes out as more of a statement. Abby leans back in her chair, scratches the left corner of her nose with a single finger. \"I was scared.\" She says simply. She summons up the courage to look him in the eyes, fighting back the tears that prick at the backs of her own. \"D'you know what dad did when he found out? He sent me away. He sent me to therapy. D'you know what happened there?\" She turns her head to the left, towards the kitchen, fervently presses a balled up fist to her lips before dropping it in her lap again. \"There were people there, Uncle, that were mad!\" She shouts, giving up her battle to fight the tears. \"He sent me away, from my warm home, to live with a bunch of nutters! I almost went insane in that place!\" She hangs her head, wraps her arms around it so that her hands rest on the back of it. \"I hated every minute of it. No one knew how to deal with me. No one would deal with me. They always had their hands full with the people that actually were insane!\" She looks up at Lizzie, eyes red, tears streaking down her face as she shakes her head. \"You don't think I'm crazy, do you?\" She whispers. Lizzie's brows are creased, her mask of calmness given way to her sympathy. She's not at the hospital anymore. She's not dealing with sad family members. She's dealing with someone she loves. She shakes her head. \"No, Abby, I don't.\" \"It's just an outlet.\" She continues. \"Just a crutch to help me get through it. After I stop the bleeding, after I slap a bandage on the wound, I'm completely fine. I'm not doing it just to do it. The hurt runs incredibly deep, and it helps me to cope. That's the answer to your question, Uncle, because I know what you were getting at.\" She mumbles, determinedly wiping away her tears. \" That ,\" She whispers. \"Is why I don't want to go to therapy. You'd be taking me out of my new home, which I do appreciate you providing me, and you'd be sending me to live with people that, bless them, have worse problems than me.\" She slumps down in her chair, panting as though she'd just run a marathon. \"I told you the other day that I hate you, but I don't. I completely respect your opinion, and I love you too, I just...\" She sighs, leaning towards him. \"You understand that, Uncle?\" He regards her quietly, nods once, slowly, then two more times quickly. \"Yeah, yeah. I understand, Abbs.\" He murmurs. Lizzie leans forward as well, places a hand on the teen's left knee. \"You've done very well tonight, Abby. I'm very proud that you were able to sit down, and tell us everything. It's helped me to see things a lot more from your perspective. But,\" Abby shakes her head, scoots her chair back slowly. \"No...\" \"I want you to see a shrink. We're not sending you away to a psychiatric center, you're not going to be living with insane people. All it is, is a nice little, everyday, just talking to the psychiatrist for an hour type thing.\" Her brows arch, hands motioning for her to come closer again. \" I know the psychiatrist I'm sending you to. I use her myself because of the things I see in my profession. I don't think you're insane, and I don't think you need to be sent away.\" She sits stiffly in her seat, knuckles white as she grips the sides of her chair. She tilts her head to the left, brows knitting in confusion. \"You mean, therapy doesn't mean going away?\" Lizzie shakes her head. \"Absolutely not.\" Now her brows furrow. \"Is that what you thought therapy is?\" She doesn't say anything...just stares at the gentle hand resting on her knee again. \"Oh, Abby.\" She's right beside her, then, arms tightly around the younger woman, rocking her gently. \"You should have said something.\" \"I was scared.\" She whispers. \"I didn't want to go through it again.\" She gives the woman a side-glance, feeling more like that young girl again than an adult. \"You promise you won't send me away?\" \"No, sweetheart.\" She assures. \"You don't need to be sent away, you just need someone to talk to.\" She allows a moment to pass, loosening her arms to give Lizzie the gist. \"Are we done talking? I'm...I'm very tired.\" The older woman nods, smiles as she gets to her feet. \"Yes, we're done. You did very good, Abby. As I said, I'm very, very proud of you. Thank you for talking.\" She looks over at Archy, eyes flicking across his face, looking for some form of confirmation. She knows, just as well as Lizzie knows, that his approval is the most important. He nods, scoots his chair back as he, too, stands up. He comes to her, and without a hint of awkwardness, wraps his arms around her. Just outside of a flat, non-too shabby, non-too fancy, a black Volvo is parked beneath a streetlamp. Two people, one young man, one young woman, one brunette and one raven-haired, sit silently with the windows rolled down. \"Do you think she'll be alright for the night?\" Jess nods her head, tossing the remainder of a burned-down cigarette out of her side of the car. \"She would have called us by now, otherwise.\" Charlie nods, also discarding his cancer stick. \"I know that.\" \"Then why did you ask?\" His head lolls in her direction, fixes her with a stare. \"I asked for the same reason you stayed parked here after she went inside.\" She nods, one hand reaching for the steering-wheel, the other for the keys. \"She won't ask for help.\" They chorus. \"Have you got a plan?\" She shakes her head, turning up the volume of the latest CD on the shelves. \"Working on it. I'll need some more sleep. Just keep your mobile next to your bed if she calls...I'll do the same.\" They don't notice, as they drive off, a man dressed in all black, from his fedora and tie, down to his socks and shoes, crouching behind the bushes next to the stairs of the flat. Checking the sidewalk in each direction, he stands, writing down the last descriptions of one male and one female, a license plate number, and car model, before sinking into an alley, unnoticed, like a shadow. Wooh! My goodness. So many emotions, so little a time-frame I wrote it in. Just to clarify, I don't own a Green Lantern wall clock...sadly, but, I do have a Green Lantern poster just above my desk...and comics...2/3rds of them Green Lantern...And a keychain...and t-shirt...and shoes...*shoves geeky glasses higher up on nose* WELL, I hope everyone enjoyed this chapter just as much as I enjoyed writing it (oh my goodness was it fun). Another shout-out to my reviewers, Yranthro, SelenesLegacy, and the helpful advice from my good friend, G.G. Blythe.[Chapter 9] My Dear Readers, Sadly, I may have to discontinue this story, and here's why: A few chapters back (chapter 7, to be exact, slightly before the cutting scene and at the very end in my author's note), I unfairly, shamefully, misrepresented God. Quote from the story: \"I'm so disappointed in you.\" Explanation at the end of the story: Richie's Voice, Just Before Cutting : Abby's conscience, and the disappointment of God looking down at sin. I didn't realize at the time what exactly I was doing, but now, the truth has been revealed to me. I portrayed Him as a wrathful God, One who frowns down on a fallen world and writes down everything that everyone does wrong. I assure you, He's not like that AT ALL. He even promises He's not. 2 Corinthians 5:18-19 What I wrote a few chapters back has been weighing on my mind lately. Please also allow me to assure you, God has NOT been condemning me for it. Rather, He's been gently reminding me, tenderly helping me to realize the mistake, and never once did I feel that He was frowning on me and not willing to reconcile me. If anything, this experience is bringing us closer. I DEEPLY apologize to you, dear readers, for the great inconvenience I've caused you in portraying Him as wrathful, cold, and distant, because He's not...He's the exact opposite (1 John 4:16). I'm not going to hide it from you. I've become a Christian. NOT a religious freak...a follower of Jesus Christ (because I guarantee you, there's a difference). I'm questioning a lot of the things in ALL the stories I've written, not just this one, because my mind is undergoing changes; it's being renewed. NOT brainwashed. Renewed (Romans 12:2). I'm not going to delete this story just yet. I'm praying about it, I'm questioning the content, and when its evaluation is complete, I'll know whether or not I should salvage it. Please don't think Jesus is a party-pooper because He's bringing the content of this story to question. Just because I've accepted Him as my Savior doesn't mean I have to stop being a creative writer, or have to stop reading fanfiction. No, no. The desires I have to be a creative writer are actually given to me (Philippians 2:13), and these desires can be far greater than I realize (Ephesians 3:20). So please, accept my apology (because one, I know you were expecting another chapter, and two, that I've portrayed God in such a bad light). Some of you might hate me and walk away from me. Some of you might think I've lost my marbles and won't want anything to do with me. Some of you will resent the purpose of my questioning this story entirely. But, you know what? That's okay. I won't hate you for it (and I promise you, He will NEVER hate you for ANYTHING either...EVER (Jeremiah 29:11; Romans 8:38-39)), I won't hold a grudge against you, and I certainly won't judge you, because I have no right to do so. I do care about your opinions, and do still want to be friends with you. I can't go on writing material that, for the most part, I feel is harming me (I do have to get a bit depressed to write some of it) and my relationship with Jesus, and possibly other people. So, as I said, I'll pray over it, I'll reconsider the material; I'm not all set to scrap the whole thing. Thanks, dear readers. God bless you.

Mr. Gristle, would you have a nine by any chance?\" \"GOLDFISH! HAHAHA!\" \"No, no, it's 'Go Fish', not 'goldfish'.\" \"Quite right, Mr. Trout.\" Mr. Pickles, Mr. Trout, and Mr. Gristle were happy to report that they found great ways to entertain themselves during their time off from work. Sitting at their table in the factory they called their work location, they look amongst each other and analyzed the back of each other's cards. Tall beanpole Pickles had seven cards in his hands, the hulking, crooked nosed thug Trout had four, and the manic iced blue eyed Gristle was, as always, winning with two. They would go around and around asking each other for specific cards. Mr. Pickles took up a card when he asked for an eight from Mr. Gristle, and then Mr. Trout took a card at the mention of a one from Mr. Pickles. Mr. Gristle, on the other hand, was soon enough, down to one card. As he giggled over his little card, he took a look at Mr. Trout and smiled with his mouth filled with crooked teeth. \"A four, Mr. Trout?\" The large yet gentle man sighed. \"Not again...\" \"...Nice...\" Mr. Gristle gladly took Mr. Trout's four of aces and laughed. \"Hmm, you always seem to win, Mr. Gristle,\" Mr. Pickles remarked. He grinned at his tall companion. \"Only when the Boss ain't playin'. He always wins when he's in,\" Mr. Trout replied. \"Oh, that's right.\" Mr. Pickles looked over at the single door that led to their truck's driveway. \"When did he say he'd be back?\" \"I'm pretty sure he said it was hard to know. Depends on how long his talk with His Lordship is.\"You think he'll be back before curfew?\" Mr. Trout gave him a funny look as Mr. Gristle shuffled the deck. \"Mr. Pickles, when has the Boss ever been late for work?\" \"Well...actually...never.\" ... The Boss' clacking footsteps echoed as he stepped through the sidewalk leading up to his final destination. The man hummed to himself as he looked about him. Fellow citizens would take a glance, give a whisper and watch him continue his walk until he disappeared from their field of vision. He didn't really mind it. The Boss liked the attention he now received from the townsfolk. Some even dared to stop and ask him about his work, to which he would explain all the he cared to in a triumphant manner. It had been almost a year since the disappearance of the local inventor, Herbert Trubshaw, and his young infant son, Arthur. And of course, because the Boss' job was that of a nightly town exterminator to be on patrol for pests, bugs, and even more so, the dreaded Boxtrolls, he was first to know. He recalled the night of the disappearance as if it was yesterday. \"Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child!\" The Mayor of the town was the first one he told. \"You're the town exterminator. I'll pay whatever it takes!\" But the Boss didn't want money. He smiled at himself as he recalled what he'd asked for. \"A White Hat? You? Absurd!\" \"Alright then, but prepare to say bye-bye to your Brie! Cheerio to your cheddar! Goodbye to your-\" \"Very well! Every Boxtroll gone! With proof...\" \"For a White Hat? I will destroy every last Boxtroll in this town!\" Following this fateful agreement, the man in the Red Hat had certainly be committing to his vow, and why wouldn't he? The White Hat was the most prestigious title in all of the town of Cheesebridge. The highest honor that any man could be rewarded for, usually by valor, chivalry, or general wealth. And the Boss, from the time he was a boy, and who also had to stand on the sidewalk with his neighbors and bow to them just like everyone else, dreamed to be as respected and in as such high regard as them. Running the town and fixing little social problems here and there were technically their primary objectives of the White Hats, but the benefit they had that the Boss had to admit he certainly liked just as much as they did, was trying the best cheeses and wines money could buy. He longed for the day that he too would receive his hat and its benefits because of his unique services to the town: eliminating the Boxtrolls, the monsters that the Boss promoted as the destroyers of the Trubshaws and the general source of all their problems. \"Lock your windows and doors! Fathers, hide your cheese! Mothers, hide your children! Tonight is no night for bravery! Leave that to us!\" This message and variations of them were the typical speeches the Boss would scream into the streets most nights, warning the town to not only keep their belongings and themselves secure, but no matter what, never leave their house until the sun had risen up again, for Boxtrolls were nocturnal and were the most dangerous at night. The Boss was quite proud of himself, and one could tell from the grin plastered on his face as he found himself at his correct destination, the Portley-Rind Mansion. The same Mayor who had promised him a prize as wonderful as a White Hat, lived here with his family, his wife the lovely Lady Portley-Rind, and their young daughter, two year old Winifred. He straightened out his vest and pushed a few greasy hair strands behind his ear. He knocked on the large double doors of the mansion and waited for a minute or two; he couldn't really tell how long it had been until he'd heard a selection of locks being clicked open one by one. In time, the doors did open, and there appeared in the doorway a unimpressed looking man, Cheshire, wearing black and white. \"Ah, yes...\" He drawled uninterested. \"His Lordship's been expecting you.\" \"Why of course, he has,\" the Boss replied in his low rumbling tones. \"I look forward to speaking with him.\" The snooty looking butler looked him up and down and reluctantly beckoned the man to follow him. The Boss smiled with his hands behind his back as he was led up the large stair case that sat at the very center of the foyer. That itself was not too dim and featured a couple of also large doors facing each other on both the left and right walls. Lights lined them and drew the Boss' eyes to the center stairs. His eyes slightly widened as he neared the center of all of the White Hats' meetings: the Tasting Room. At the top of the stairs, there was one more pair of double doors that led into a comfortable room with a fire place, a table, three cushioned chairs, and, on the nights in which the White Hats would have their meetings, piles and piles of cheese on top of the rounded wooden surface they would surround and chat at. The Boss could practically sense them, but inwardly admitted that it was for the best that he really couldn't at that moment. As much as he wanted to stay and marvel at his most favorite place in the town, he knew the butler was taking him to a different place; one not quite as interesting as the Tasting Room. Cheshire led him towards the right of the Tasting Room, where they mostly passed by still life paintings of cheese, and marble busts of past Portley-Rinds and their fellow past White Hats. Cheshire looked back and could tell that the Boss was much more interested in the busts than the still life paintings. \"Perhaps there will be a bust of me here someday,\" he thought to himself. He smiled in amusement to himself at the idea of young Winifred's children, grandchildren and so on having to look at him day in and day out in the form of a statue. 'The Obliterator of Boxtrolls' on a bust sounded quite nice to him. Eventually, he and Cheshire stopped at yet another pair of doors. The butler warily knocked and pressed his ear to them. \"Come in,\" a masculine voice from behind them said. Cheshire opened one of the doors and found a Sitting Room with three people already inside, His Lordship, His Ladyship, and Winifred. This little red haired girl was the first to see the butler. \"Cheshire,\" she spoke. Her parents noticed and looked up to greet him as well. \"Hello, Miss Portley-Rind, Your Ladyship,\" the girl's mother returned his greeting with a nod. \"Your Lordship?\" Cheshire continued. A man with flaming red hair, the same as his daughter's, had his back turned before Winifred had pointed Cheshire out to him. He turned, his mustache twitching as he analyzed what was behind him. His heart sank when he saw whom Cheshire was with. When the butler had taken a couple steps into the room to speak, the Boss followed, his presence now completely inside the room. \"He's here, sir.\" Lord Portley-Rind turned annoyed and sighed. \"Dearest, would you be so kind as to take Winifred and meet me in the Dining Hall in about...ten minutes? We shall finish our conversation later,\" his wife took a look behind her husband, widened her eyes in understanding, and nodded. \"Come, Winifred, darling, Father has some business to attend to,\" she said to Winnie nicely. \"Daddy?\" the little girl replied. \"Just for a short while,\" her father replied nonchalantly. Her Ladyship took Winnie into her arms and led her towards the door, but as she did, she remembered whom she was passing by, and tried to keep her weak composure before the unsettling man her butler was letting in. \"Why, Your Ladyship,\" the Boss said as he looked at her. \"You and Young Miss Portley-Rind look lovelier every day.\" As he said this, little toddler Winnie looked at Mr. Snatcher and turned away from this crooked toothed man who came off as little unsettling to be around. Despite his status as 'the gentlemanly hero' of the town, all she saw was a pale ill-proportioned man with lanky looking limbs supporting a strangely round, protruding middle, and a demeanor that bothered her as he glanced up at her with his gray, colorless eyes. She didn't know the word for it at the time, but if she did, she would have described him as 'condescending', at least towards her anyway. \"Well, thank you,\" Her Ladyship replied cautiously. \"Excuse us.\" Winifred had never been so happy to be removed from her family's own Sitting Room. \"Stay right outside the door, will you, Cheshire?\" His Lordship asked. \"Of course, sir,\" the butler replied. He closed the door, leaving His Lordship and the Boss all by themselves. \"Mr. Snatcher, please have a seat.\" His guest seemed to notice his disinterested tone but regardless, he sat down across from him. \"D'you know, Your Lordship, I caught two Boxtrolls last night? Difficult little things, they were. Running about plotting and scheming, the way they will. But those pests are no match for me and my men. I just know it won't be long before this good town of ours lives in a Boxtroll free world!\" He had lifted his arms and spread them out an inch or two to emphasize. Mr. Snatcher always was the dramatic type. His Lordship was silent, still looking subtly aggravated that he was present in his house, but then he remembered exactly why he was there to begin with. \"Mr. Snatcher, do you know why I asked for you to come over for a talk?\" The red clad man leaned back and tapped his fingers together, as if in thought as he replied. \"To discuss business matters of course, not to mention how my end of our deal is progressing; it's all going wonderfully might I add.\" Lord Portley-Rind sighed. He looked at himself, his white apparel matching his white silk hat, which sat beside him. He straightened himself up. \"The latter is what I wish to discuss with you, Mr. Snatcher.\" The red clad man did the same, all with his untrustworthy smile still on his face. \"I know we've talked about this time and time again, but I humbly ask that you ask for something different this time in return for your services.\" Mr. Snatcher chuckled at him. \"Oh, sir, no I'm afraid I can't do that.\" Lord Portley-Rind gave him a disagreeable look. \"And why not? You're a thinking, capable man. Surely you can think of something else you might like besides a White Hat.\" \"But a White Hat is a proper reward, sir. Anyone can ask for money or gems, or even cheese for their services, but I eliminate Boxtrolls, which is no easy task, My Lord. It requires so much planning, strategizing, and of course the bravery to even try and stand up to those creatures. Such a valiant service to our community deserves a reward equal to its dangers and difficulty.\" \"I don't suppose that happy feeling of a job well done is enough after you present the proof I've asked for?\" asked the Mayor. The exterminator laughed. \"Sounds nice, sir, but not very realistic. It just saddens me that you still try to back out of our deal, even after all this time.\" Lord Portley-Rind groaned as silently as he could. \"I'm just trying to give you other options. Quite frankly, it's foolish of me to think that you would understand by now that...everyone has their place in this town where they fit best, wouldn't you at least agree with that? Some are White Hats who keep watch of the town, some are Red Hats such as yourself who exterminate vermin, and then of course you've got merchants, doctors, lawyers, maintenance specialists, and for God's sake, even children have their own responsibilities as they realize their own way. I hope you understand what I am trying to say.\" Mr. Snatcher sat and listened, and yet he didn't at the same time. \"True...\" Lord Portley-Rind blinked. \"Really?\" He asked in a calm sort of disbelief. \"Everyone in this town has a place...and my place is that of an influential man.\" His Lordship rolled his eyes. \"Aren't you already?\" His volume increased slightly. The Red Hat didn't seem as if he had expected this sudden change of tone. The two could feel the tension in the room. The only sound that could be heard was the flicker of the fireplace, producing on orange glow on both men amongst their dimly lit surroundings. \"Every night you tell everyone to hide and lock their doors, to keep themselves and their loved ones safe from grotesque monsters. And everyone believes you because of your testimonies! I believe you! You have influence already! Isn't that enough?\" Mr. Snatcher's calm smile slowly began to fade. \"But with a White Hat I can use my influence even more so, wouldn't you agree?\" He asked, anger becoming visible on his face. \"DAMMIT, SNATCHER!\" Snatcher's fingers tensed up at the Mayor's outburst, the latter standing up to prove his point. \"Don't you understand?! You don't belong with the White Hats! You are a Red Hat! You're trying to become something you're not! You will NOT earn my respect or the respect of my fellow White Hats this way!\" Mr. Snatcher scowled at this attempt at intimidation. \"Well, sir,\" he too stood up and leaned forward, ready for just about anything. \"I don't have much respect for those who don't follow through on their agreements. I shall destroy every Boxtroll and earn the hat that you promised...support or not,\" his tone was demeaning yet deadly. The two men were silent for a minute; Lord Portley-Rind on the left and Mr. Snatcher on the right. \"Don't you have anything good to say about your current situation? Surely you must find some satisfaction in your job? Friends? Even family?\" \"Aah, there you go again, Your Lordship, and for your information, no, I'm not married...at the moment. However...\" He stood straight up and stared off into a random distant spot on the wall. \"...yes, I do have a great deal of satisfaction in my work. Crushing monsters one by one for what they've done and who they are; pests, of course. It's also quite gratifying, knowing the promise I hope is kept,\" as he said this last little sentence, he turned back to Lord Portley-Rind, his empty eyes pouring into him like a waterfall. An echo of laughter rang through the halls; Winifred's very own. Whatever she and her Mother were doing, it must have been enjoyable. The Mayor's family appeared in his head for a moment. His volume slightly decreased. \"Quite sad, don't you think so? Influence and possible success and no friends or family to share it with?\" With one hand on his hip and the other dangling by his side, Mr. Snatcher was quiet for another moment or so. \"I doubt there's harm in acquiring these in the order of my choosing. I was hoping you'd found that out by now that I prioritize my time quite differently than others.\" His Lordship sighed annoyingly. \"There's no persuading you, is there?\" His Lordship asked, standing up straight and tall. Mr. Snatcher smiled. \"Not when it comes to agreements, sir.\" More silence; His Lordship's cheeks flushed with anger at this man who clearly didn't belong. \"Very well then...I shall ask Cheshire to walk you out.\" ... \"Pompous twit.\" This was the first thing Mr. Snatcher thought as he walked away from the Portley-Rind mansion. Commending himself on his ability to stand firm, he straightened himself up and took his familiar route back to his factory. \"One day, he'll see things my way. They all will,\" he muttered to himself. Passing by the Market Square, he took a notice at some of his fellow citizens. Some of them were the merchants, just as His Lordship had mentioned. Others were their customers and many of them were not alone. He only glanced as he saw mostly families consisting of one father, one mother, and one, two, sometimes even three children. And they all looked happy. Despite everything they had to go through; always keeping an eye on each other, hoping and praying that a monster wouldn't disrupt their household, there was still some joy to gain living in a town filled with snobs. Mr. Snatcher didn't stop to chat, for he had other business to attend to. \"Gentlemen, why ain't I loved?\" Mr. Pickles, Mr. Trout, and Mr. Gristle surrounded him as they sat at their table. Originally discussing only certain details of his meeting with His Lordship, here comes Mr. Snatcher's strange question. \"How do you figure, Boss?\" Mr. Trout asked. \"In all my years I've only been married once, years ago...and now here I am after all this time, realizing that I've yet to form anymore relationships beyond my work and goal for the future.\" \"Well...we like you, Boss!\" Mr. Pickles said with a hopeful smile. Mr. Gristle said nothing. He only listened intently and processed it all in silence. Mr. Snatcher gave Mr. Pickles a look of annoyance. \"I said 'loved' not 'liked', Mr. Pickles.\" Sensing his subtle tone of annoyance, the beanpole apologized and fell silent. \"What do all those current White Hats have in common, gentlemen?\" His three employees looked at each other. \"They all meet at His Lordship's mansion at least once a week?\" asked Mr. Pickles. \"They get to eat cheese?\" asked Mr. Trout \"HAT!\" Mr. Gristle finally spoke. Mr. Snatcher rolled his eyes. \"No, no!\" He cried slamming a fist on the table. \"...well, yes, they do. But they have something I surely don't, and won't have unless I do something.\" \"May we ask what that is, Boss?\" Trout asked, sounding genuinely curious. \"Families.\" Pickles, Trout, and Gristle all released a collective 'oh'. \"Are you feeling lonely, Boss?\" Mr. Pickles asked concernedly. Mr. Snatcher scoffed. \"Me? Archibald Snatcher lonely? Nonsense!\" Trout and Pickles glanced at each other, their worried looks remaining on their faces. The longer they stared at him, the more determined and stressed their Boss seemed to be. \"Mr. Trout, get out the wine, will you?\" A frazzled Snatcher said. The hulking man lifted himself from his seat and walked towards the cupboard right by their table. Pulling out a full wine and four glasses, he cautiously poured the drink into each one. He handed the first one to Mr. Snatcher (because he knew better than to do otherwise), the second to Mr. Gristle, the third to Mr. Pickles, and the last to himself. \"Hmm...\" he leaned back in his chair, kicked his feet up onto their table, and daintily shook the glass to mix the wine, sniffed it, and sipped it from his glass. His men watched him until he started drinking, and then they too brought their glasses to their lips. Their Boss seemed quite pleased with his drink, for he sighed and smiled quite peacefully. \"A hint of apple and lime; quite fascinating. Ideal drink for settling nerves...now where was I?\" \"All of the White Hats have families, Boss,\" Mr. Pickles gently pointed out. \"Ahh, yes, of course, now only great men can become White Hats. That much is certain, and it seems they all have the support of their wives and children, don't they? They respect all of their choices and stand behind them without question or fail. Perfect for building credibility with our fellow Cheesebridgians, wouldn't you agree?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Mr. Trout. Snatcher sipped a little more. \"Smashing wine, old chaps...Yes, great men need a loyal family, don't they? A committed wife and a child to live up to his legacy,\" He asked, as if thinking out loud. \"Completely understandable, Boss,\" Pickles said. Mr. Snatcher tapped his chin as his mind processed his observations. He finished his wine. \"Certainly something to think about, men.\" He pulled a watch out from his coat pocket and looked at it. \"But we must continue this later, for...\" He raised up from his chair triumphantly. \"T'is time for the curfew!\" \"EXTERMINATE!\"[Chapter 2] Free Pepper Chapter 1 This has got to be the strangest town I've ever seen. A tall looming hill with all kinds of little houses all stacked on each other. Odd, if you ask me. Then again, no one asks me about much anyway, but maybe things will be different here. 'Cheesebridge', they call it. 'A Gouda Place to Live' , I would later read on a nearby poster. New town, new people, new life, and I'm nervous, yet a little excited. The first thing I saw coming into town wasn't really the poster. It was the town itself, piled up on a hill, and then a river; a cold, blue one that surrounded the town and stretched far off into the surrounding hills. They all looked nice though. Far different from the dingy slums and docks by the River Thames, and I should know. As I walked closer and closer into the town, I noticed the largest factory I'd ever seen. A behemoth topped with a gigantically tall red hat touched the river's shore and led me to the first street in the town: Curd's Way. Curds? As in 'Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey'? So is there a Spider Lane in this town too? I didn't stop to find out. I started up the long cobblestone path that would take me into the town itself. The houses and businesses all looked situation next to each other and connected. Each building looked empty and closed for the night. The only lights around me came from the streetlights, the moon way up above, and the stars I could barely see. I followed a long winding sidewalk up towards the very top of the hill, curious to know what would be there. \"It's quiet,\" I thought to myself. Except for the occasional dog bark, it was hard to hear anything. Not because of my ears but because there was literally nothing. A little breeze perhaps, but other than that, the town was still and quiet. Soon enough, I did indeed find the poster promoting Cheesebridge. I stopped and stared at it for awhile. I knew literally nothing about this town, but I rose an eyebrow. \"They must really like cheese,\" I whispered. As I followed the wall the poster was attached to, I noticed a couple more posters. When the Curfew's Alive, Stay Inside Red Hats: Boxtroll Exterminators Beware the Sewers, for... \" 'Here Be Monsters' ...\" I finished reading. I then looked all around and warily stepped. \"If there's a curfew, I oughta find someplace to go,\" I whispered. Surely there must be some sort of inn. I reached into my satchel and pulled out a few coins and several pound notes. Some of them were 10 pound notes, others were 15, even 20. I stuffed them back in and kept my eyes open for anything resembling a place to stay. A blinking streetlight sat beside a building that made me stop and look at a two story building labeled, 'The Four Cheese Sons Hotel' in great big letters on top. I just had to smile. I looked both ways of the street and quickly walked across. I practically ran to it because of my long journey to find a new place. However, as I neared it, my smile faded and my pace slowed considerably. The door I found to the building had a nailed in sign that stopped her in her tracks. CLOSED. \"Drat, even the inn? This curfew doesn't like me,\" I whispered. The building was as dark and empty looking as all the others. I turned back around and looked left, then right. Where am I going to sleep? What am I going to eat? I looked at my face in a nearby puddle. My long, deep red hair was all matted and my brown eyes were sagging with bags. I was so young, yet I knew what I was doing. \"I'll find somewhere else and stay there, and then I'll come back in the morning.\" The breeze made me shiver, so I wrapped my arms around me, and rubbed as fast as I could. \"Maybe there's a box I can sleep in somewhere...f-for now.\" I walked towards the first alley I saw, past a florist shop, and heard something. I jumped and squeaked as I drew closer to that little slot between building where I could hide for now. The rustling sound I heard come with a couple of gargles and gurgles, as if two creatures who knew no English, were speaking and arguing. I found an entrance to my target, hid by the wall, and simple stared. The alley was infested with even more unusual images; little creatures with pointed ears, blue-green, sometimes purple skin, bandaged feet, stubby fingers, and a box to cover everything else. All they seemed to be doing was searching through trash cans, looking for garbage. Why would they want to though? If it's in the trash, then obviously it can't be needed anymore, right? Even at my then young age of six, I just knew these had to be the Boxtrolls! The posters suggested that they were monsters, yet they didn't appear that way. \"They don't seem monstrous.\" I did see a couple of them fighting though. A tall Boxtroll with a fish on its box was being attacked (not violently though) by another one with a shoe on its own. They looked as if they were fighting over a thrown out clock. Again, what's so special about a thrown out clock? As I watched, I had found a large empty box turned on its front side to hide under, figuring that if they were mean, at least they won't see me. Wondering, who would win the fight, it was all suddenly cut short by yet another strange sound. I remember back in London I used to hear the sounds of engines revving from real life motor cars. I heard they were going to be the next big thing, and it seemed as if Cheesebridge had them too. The creatures didn't seem to like them though because all too quickly they jumped in place and hid inside their boxes. I found it odd that as they hid, their boxes looked absolutely empty and normal. But even I knew better than to stay out in the open during troubling situations. I hid underneath my box but only peeked out so that I could see if it truly was one of those brand new motor cars. I peeped at it and was awfully confused. The car that pulled up into the alley way was enormous and box shaped. On one side of it, I saw a painting of a creature just like the ones I'd seen but with a big red cross running through it. One by one, men came down from the box car. \"Wow, men, real ones,\" I thought. The first man was tall and skinny (like me only I'm quite short). Even though his clothes were something of a chocolate brown, it was mismatched by a tall red top hat, and in his hands, he carried a net. He had a kindly face though. He wasn't super handsome, but it was soft in a nice way. The second man I saw was exactly the opposite of me; a big bulky man, yet with the tiniest bowler hat I'd ever seen. To me, he seemed like the sort of man who could beat a person up, but much like the first man, his face suggested a calm, gentle demeanor that wouldn't do so unless absolutely necessary. The third man on the other hand, was short like me, but his face seemed...what's a nice word for it...manic; as if anything was enough to set this man off into doing something one would find questionable. His eyes were really light, I realized; a very bright blue color that hid behind black round framed spectacles. His clothes were a dark bluish green, but much like the first two, he also had a tall red hat; not as tall as the first man's, and his even had a hole in it. Before I could question the hole in the third man's hat, a loud voice interrupted my thoughts. \"GENTLEMEN!\" I dropped my box over my body once I heard it. The call sounded deep and threatening; almost as if the voice was coming from a place different from the source's throat. I tipped my box open ever so slightly and found the fourth man. It was hard to look away. \"Look at all these boxes left lying abouuuut. How curious, how peculiar. I do believe evil is afoot.\" The hiss in his voice and the stressing of certain syllables made me shudder. The last of these red topped men filled me with an unfamiliar air of dread. While I know it's not right to judge someone by appearance alone, and I'm sorry if I sound judgmental, I have to be honest. I didn't have to look at him for very long to know that his appearance alone bothered me. As the first three men searched through the other boxes, empty and otherwise, I started at this fourth man's feet and my eyes traveled up from there. His shoes were a brownish orange with a one (maybe two) centimeter heel and a pointed toe. Its gold stitching reminded me of hoity-toity business men from London. However, the first thing that separated the man from them was his trousers. They didn't even reach all the way to his ankles, like I thought they were suppose to. His ankles were bare and gray with soot (at least it looked like a sooty kind of gray). Three or four centimeters above his ankle was where his trousers began. His legs were thin, not as thin as mine, and they were covered with pants that almost looked like they were peeling. As I kept looking up, I realized why his trousers seemed a bit short on him: right above his thighs was a round, bulging stomach that, if anything, made him appear hunched over. Looking at his frame, I finally noticed that though he wore brown like the first two men, his hat was complimented by his red, velvet coat with a chestnut brown fur collar and more gold stitching that formed curved patterns. His ovular face was pretty pale, with crooked teeth, a pointed nose, long greasy strands of dark brown hair (most of which was pulled back by its ends with a hair tie), and a pair of gray eyes that suggested that he had probably seen a great deal of grown up things that I had never known. This mountain of a man was topped off by the tallest red hat I'd ever seen. He must have been very important. Where I came from, only important leaders would typically have velvet coats with fur and gold stitching, not to mention the tallest hat in his company. His voice, gestures, cold gaze towards the empty boxes, and reptilian appearance frightened me, and I didn't even know his name. \"Are all men like this?\" I thought. I ignored the conversation the first two of his men were having as I observed everything (something about feet, a bunion, and a grandma), but I did notice the short imp with the spectacles smack a few boxes with his rope gun. A couple even had those creatures in them. I watched the bulky man in the bowler hat take one while the first man with the net slammed down on it with his net. They're taking these trolls, I realized. And they all wear red hats? That's when it hit me. The Boxtroll Exterminators. \"MR. GRISTLE, ACQUIRE THEM!\" The creepy man pointed in her opposite direction and off went the man with the hole in his hat. \"Acquire...acquire! Ahaha! COME BACK AND LET ME HIT YOU!\" We both watched the manic Gristle run off after a couple of moving boxes the Leader must have noticed before I did. The latter turned his head and watched until the laughing man was out of sight and after the little monsters. With the leading Red Hat's head turned, now was probably the best time to find a better hiding place. I could hear the footsteps of the other men in the red hats. Two sets of taps and a set of clacking rang in my ears as I slowly but quietly crawled through the garbage, with one hand clutching my bag to keep it from making a noise from dragging along the ground. I just had to get away from those first two men, (the friendly looking ones), and their intimidating Leader.[Chapter 3] Free Pepper Chapter 2 I woke up the following morning inside an empty barrel right by the hotel. Gleams of sunlight came in through the lid that thankfully had a hole in it so I wouldn't suffocate. I did wake up with a drops of sweat running down my face and chest. The moment my eyes opened, I looked around, remembered where I was, and pushed the lid off the surface. I pulled myself up and popped my head out. Cheesebridge had drastically changed from the night before. The buildings and sidewalks glistened with sunlight with shade coming from the various structures of the town. A few men and women and even some children were out in the streets. A few were couples walked by speaking to each other as they passed by her. The children played with jump ropes and Hopskotch; they even looked around my age. With the peaceful, happy people and the much prettier looking structures around me, the town I found last night seemed much more bright, beautiful world than I'd ever imagined. Putting my feet on the ground, I straightened my button down shirt, pulled down my shorts, and tugged on my bag to make sure it was still there. I brushed the dust off me and straightened up. I watched the children, two boys and three girls, play a little more before I approached them. \"Umm...excuse me?\" When they looked at me, I realized how different I appeared from them. The girls had ringlets and bows in their hair, and sported pretty dresses with fabric made flowers at their waists and closed toed buckled shoes. The boys looked refined in their clean button down shirts and trousers, and combed hair. And then there was me with my long auburn hair all dirty and limp, my smudgy boys' button down shirt, and jockey shorts. I didn't even have shoes with buckles like the girls (maybe that was why I kept glancing at them). \"Pardon me, but why are you wearing boys' clothes?\" one brunette girl in a blue dress asked. \"And, I say, your feet are bare!\" a handsome sandy blonde-redhead boy in light green asked. \"Are those jockey shorts?\" a shrill blonde girl in yellow asked. I backed away for a minute as I bit my lip. \"I'm afraid I don't have shoes, and...\" I looked down at myself. \"...this is all I have for clothes.\" \"What a shame!\" a smart sounding blonde boy in light brown said. \"Can't your parents buy you clothes?\" a girl in a lavender dress with black hair and a necklace asked. I frowned. \"No...I don't even know where they are.\" The children looked at each other. \"Oh, you must be one of those children from the orphanage on Cheddar Crescent, yes?\" the shrill blonde asked. \"...I didn't even know there was one.\" The children looked a little shocked and whispered to each other. \"You're not a street urchin, are you?\" the handsome redhead said. I felt a little tingly inside. They reminded me a little of the wealthy children in London. \"If they're anything like them, they'll think I'm simply ghastly.\" \"Well...I-\" \"Because if you are, that just can't be!\" the handsome redhead continued. He took a step towards me, and I blushed a little. \"No one can live on the streets in this town!\" \"H-how come?\" I asked. \"Is it because of the Boxtrolls?\" The shrilly blonde girl hissed and held her hands back with a look of disgust on her face. It was actually a little humorous. \"Ugh! Yes! Those monsters!\" \"I heard one last night from my bedroom window. I wonder if they took anyone last night. That ever happens again, this whole town'll fall down. I just know it!\" replied the girl in lavender, now looking a very uneasy. \"I don't think so...I mean if that had really happened...well...the Troll Man would've said something,\" the girl in blue said shyly. This made me look at her. \"Who?\" \"Archibald Snatcher, the Troll Man, you know,\" replied the redhead boy. \"If he'd seen something, he'd have waken us all up this morning telling us all about it.\" That name...Archibald Snatcher? \"Does he have a red coat and hat?\" \"Yes, why do you ask?\" the blonde boy asked. I looked at all of them. I felt a little thankful that we weren't talking about my clothes anymore, but their large eyes pouring into me, and my curiosity about the scary man I saw last night made me feel just as awkward. \"I think I saw him last night and-\" \"Oh my! Did he see you?\" the girl in yellow asked. \"No...\" \"Oh good, I wouldn't dream of being out there with the Boxtrolls and Red Hats. Not since the Trubshaw Baby Incident. I don't know what I'd do!\" replied the girl in lavender. \"Who's Trubshaw Baby?\" I asked. The blonde boy stepped up. \"The Trubshaw Baby was a little baby who was taken and eaten by Boxtrolls just last year. His father went after him, but he didn't survive either! Yesterday was the first anniversary. Awful sad, isn't it?\" I stood there in silence for a minute. \"So that's why the Boxtroll exterminators hunt them? Because of what they did?\" The children looked at me funny. \"Have you lived in Cheesebridge very long?\" the blonde boy asked. How do I respond? \"I came into town last night.\" \"Oh,\" they all replied. \"I'm James Goudman,\" the handsome redhead said almost immediately. I smiled at him. Even his name was nice, and he acted just the same. They all did. I shook his hand and the hands of the other children. So there was Leona in her lavender dress, Bryan the blonde boy, Abigail the blonde girl in yellow, Skyla the brunette in blue, and of course, James...and then there was me, Pepper from London, who had been invited to play and no longer felt self conscious about my appearance. Of course that could have been mostly because Bryan had luckily lived close by, hurried home, and gave me a pair of his old boys' trousers to wear; not very feminine, but it would do for now. We gathered around in a circle and watched as Bryan set up a circle in a street corner where he, James and Abigail played 'Marbles'. \"So where do you live?\" Skyla asked while Bryan counted his marbles. \"Right other there,\" I pointed out the barrel I slept in last night. \"There? Not very clean, don't you think?\" Abigail had asked. \"Well, I tried to get into the Inn last night, but it was closed and all dark,\" I replied. \"Yes, but that's to be expected in this city,\" Bryan explained. \"You should try the Cheddar Crescent Orphanage instead. The inn's expensive, and since you're...well...\" \"All alone?\" I asked. \"Well, that and a child like us, I'm sure they'd let you in.\" \"My mother volunteers other there sometimes,\" Skyla mentioned. \"The ladies who run it are very nice and they try their hardest to keep it clean.\" I was silent for a minute. \"I-I don't think so.\" And all of them looked at me like I was crazy. \"And why not?\" James asked. London came to mind. You don' do nothin' right, ya lil yobbo! Get outta my shop, you lil' thief, 'n' don' come back! You wouldn't last a bally day out there, luv, 'n' that's just 'ow it is. \"Where I come from, a lonely kid isn't the best thing to be. Lots of the people there can't stand them...it's part of why I left.\" Skyla looked a little upset. \"I'm sorry, Pepper.\" \"No, no,\" I told her. \"Don't feel bad for me. I'm glad I left. Being a traveler is fun.\" \"Most of the time...\" \"You're not going to stay?\" Leona asked. \"I'm not sure.\" \"Well, if you do, hopefully you'll be glad to know that taking care of children is a big thing here in Cheesebridge. Ever since the Trubshaws died, we've gotten a curfew, Boxtroll lessons in school, lectures about what to do in emergencies, lots of things. Even the kids on Cheddar Crescent have a curfew and lessons too. Can't be left out of the loop, you know,\" James explained. \"But I still don't know,\" I told him. \"If I were you, I'd head to Cheddar Crescent as soon as we're done here. They'll give you a bed, a proper dress, and everything,\" Abigail said in a matter-of-fact kind of tone. I know I'm sounding repetitive right now, but I just couldn't figure out what to do. For the time being, my new friends took me all over Cheesebridge. They introduced me to the Market Square, which had all sorts of stands holding a variety of food and trinkets. Unbuttoning my bag, I pulled out a couple of one pound notes and bought a snack, a piece of Gouda. I bought another one, a block of it, and had the seller at the stand wrap it up for me to enjoy later. Abigail and Leona must have been well off too because they had a bit of money with them too. I couldn't help but notice a few people looking at me strangely. They must not have ever seen a girl wear boys' clothes' before; not to mention barefoot. Funny stares are nothing new for me though. They showed me the largest mansion in the whole town, The Cheese Guild, the home of the mayor, Lord Portley-Rind and his little family and staff. I was used to parliaments and the queen living on the nicer side of my hometown, so a mayor topped with a White Hat and surrounded by fellow White Hats confused me a bit. \"The White Hats are the blokes who fix all the problems 'round here that aren't about trolls. Troll jobs go to the Red Hats,\" James told me. \"They also get to taste lots and lots of cheese.\" \"Why is this town so cheese centered, James?\" I asked. \"That's just how it's always been,\" he said. \"I'm pretty sure it was founded on cheese. The cattle out in the pasture was all this whole place was at one point, but settlers from London wanted to start anew and used the cattle to start a cheese business. One thing led to another, and now we've got a town,\" Bryan replied. \"At least I think that's how it happened.\" Walking down Cheddar Crescent, Skyla pointed out the orphanage to me on the way down. It seemed alright, just this little building with a couple of ladies and a cluster of children (most of them looked a little older than me) playing on its stoop. They looked happy enough, but all I could do was frown. She's a problem child, she is! I'll be surprised if anyone claims her; she's so shy. All she does is run around the docks. Ungrateful girl causin' trouble, no doubt. I did my best to ignore the quaint little building. It was hard to see my friends leave. We eventually found ourselves back at the Inn and played Hopscotch until their parents came by to tell them to come home with them. They too gave me strange looks when my friends pointed them out to me. Little whispers and the occasional glance at me made me take a step back and a courteously nod. With each disappearing friend, their parents pulled them from me, take another look, and scurry away. My lips wouldn't stop frowning, for some of the people here reminded me far too much of where I'd been before. Surely not everywhere I go will be filled with people like this. But then again, looking at myself in my dirty boys' clothes and lack of shoes, should I blame them? Does every town insist on giving ill dressed folks dissatisfied looks? If so, I'll know exactly what to do. Bryan was the last to leave, his parents giving me the funniest look out of all of them. Were they noticing his trousers on me? Maybe so...and I wish I hadn't cared. All alone again, I marched straight into the Four Cheese Sons Hotel. I shall have my own room, find my own way, and I didn't care what anyone thought. People won't look at me funny anymore soon enough. The inside of the Inn was actually quite lovely. Wooden furniture with plush cushions for a Sitting Room, a chandelier up above to give it style, marble squares in the floor, and a Check-In table run by a snobby looking man in a black curled mustache. I took a deep breath, pulled down my shirt, pulled up my pants, and swiped the dust away from my person. I walked elegantly towards the table and cleared my throat. \"Pardon me, sir?\" I asked in a mannerly way. He looked over the counter but I could tell he was surprised to see someone so young and so short approach him, so he leaned over to look at me. \"Yes...Miss?\" he seemed to notice my wardrobe and lifted an eyebrow. I opened my bag and pulled out my multiple pound notes. \"I'd like a room, please.\" The man looked at me, my money, and then left and right. \"Are your parents about?\" he asked curiously. I sighed. \"Actually no...I'm alone for now, but I can handle it.\" \"I can't give a child a room key without a parent or guardian,\" he replied dryly. \"But I don't have those things. I have the money for it though,\" I defended. \"I'm afraid it doesn't matter,\" his tone hardened. He looked at me and I had a feeling I knew what was coming. \"Where are you from?\" he asked. \"London, England, sir.\" \"Hmm...you sound like it.\" What's that supposed to mean? \"Now where'd you get this money, child?\" he stared at it as he asked. He wasn't already jumping to conclusions, was he? \"I earned it. I got it before I left home because I'm a traveler, sir,\" I replied. He gave me a look of disbelief. \"How old are you?\" he asked. \"Six and a half,\" I replied. That, he seemed to believe. But soon enough he gave me a look that had a mix of snobbery and frustration. \"You earned this? How could girl as young as you have worked so much that you're getting this! How d'I know you didn't steal it?\" \"B-b-but I really didn't! It was given to me. I swear it!\" \"It certainly appears that way. This is a proper hotel, not a boarding house, and certainly not an orphanage. There's one on Cheddar Crescent though.\" \"Again, that dumb old orphanage.\" \"Miss, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" \"But, sir-\" \"We don't take suspicious ill-dressed children.\" \"But I didn't do anything wrong!\" The man rang a bell and soon came other members of the staff, I assumed, and came towards me. I pushed my money back into my bag. \"Escort this little urchin out, will you?\" A bulky looking man wearing orange wrapped his arms around and carried me away. I expected to collide with the hard pavement, but I was simply put down in the street, and watched the Inn's door close on my face. I'm not going to that rotten orphanage; not after everything that happened in my hometown. If that meant retreating to my barrel, so be it. I tried dragging the barrel closer to the nearest alley way just in case. I certainly didn't want that hotheaded Inn Keeper yelling at me for anything else. They alleyway I found was pretty clear compared to last night, in which many of them were covered in boxes and trash. As the sky turned from blue to orange, I figured that this curfew would begin soon. Some of the businesses looked like they were closing and I could see people in the houses lock their windows and pull the curtains to shield the inside. The streets shifted from busy and thriving to empty and quiet. At least, with the exception of one sound: \"HEAR YE! HEAR YE! GOOD CITIZENS OF CHEESEBRIDGE! THE CURFEW IS ALIVE AND WELL! DON'T BE CAUGHT ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS!\" I practically jumped at that low oily voice that would no doubt haunt my dreams. I ran out of the alley but scampered back in the moment I saw the Box Truck from last night. The large man with the bowler seemed to be in the driver's seat steering a small wheel. The tall skinny man and the ice-blue eyed imp held onto the sides (most likely by handlebars). And there on the very top of the truck sat the Troll Man himself in a comfortable looking seat right beside a table holding what looked like a pot of tea and a tea cup and saucer. He held what seemed to be the speaker of a phonograph. Up above it was a little umbrella to cover his head and chair. I hid against the alley wall and watched them come up the street. \"FATHERS, HIDE YOUR CHEESE! MOTHERS, HIDE YOUR CHILDREN!\" His voice made me shiver as they grew closer. As the Box Truck and I became parallel with each other, I could've sworn I saw the grays in his eyes hit me, causing me to slip drastically quickly, and further and further into the alley. He didn't see me, did he? I certainly hope not! Forget worrying about where to sleep. I need to hide from the big bad Troll Man. I camouflaged my barrel with a couple of trashcans and dashed inside it, making sure to cover the barrel with my lid. If it weren't for the holes they had, I don't how long I would have been able to stay inside. As I sat there in that enclosed space, I could hear grumbling outside. I looked through the barrel's hole and found more Boxtrolls searching through the trash. One of them, a tiny purple one wearing and actually holding an oil can looked as if he was examining an open door. It stared at it with while its little finger tapped its cheek, as if thinking intently. The little troll put a hand on the door and swung it back and forth quietly. As it squeaked, it would drip some oil into its hinges and sure enough, the door fell silent. And these were the same trolls who killed a baby and his father? The other trolls mostly minded their own business, looking through garbage and not harming anything or anyone. They did gurgle to each other over the objects they found. One troll with the words 'High Voltage' on its box and another wearing a box for spectacles chatted with each other about a set of bent forks and light bulbs they'd found. Even though I couldn't understand their 'troll speech' so to speak, their behavior suggested that they weren't necessarily monsters. They just seemed...alright. I watched as the trolls froze in their tracks and look terrifyingly towards the other end of the alley. We all heard a strange clacking sound come closer and closer. As I rolled up my trousers when they frantically scattered out of the alley, the ominous sound just got louder and louder. Even I was getting a little fearful. I sat down in my barrel and stretched my legs out as I just sat there. I wiped some sweat from my brow as my heart beat quickened. Clack, clack, clack The escaping trolls and my increasing stress levels could only bring me to one conclusion. It had to be a Red Hat, so I hoped and prayed that it would at least by the friendly looking Red Hats with the net and bowler hat. There were two out of the four Red Hats I knew of and 50/50 wasn't too bad. Clack, clack, clack I bit my lips and caught a tear running from my eye. Wrapping my arms my knees, I brought the latter up to my chin and closed my eyes. And to make things worse, i was hungry. I silently opened my bag and unwrapped my leftover block of cheese. Nibbling like a mouse, I almost held my breath as I swallowed this town's most precious resource. I didn't even realize the clacking footsteps had ceased. BANG! My world spun around as I chewed on tiny bits of Gouda. \"EEK!\" I cried, twirling about as the barrel lost balance and toppled over with a crash. My tears came back as I stayed perfectly still. I took several short breaths, praying, despite my dizziness, that they weren't too loud and whatever pushed the barrel over wouldn't try anything. As much as I would have loved to have been left there, my wish would never be granted, for within a minute of falling over, a frigid, elongated hand grabbed my arm and pulled me out. I was lowered to the floor, looked up, and backed away. I shuddered among the trash and nervously nibbled a little more of my cheese as my founder made eye contact with me. The first thing I dared to look at was his peeling trousers, his blood red coat and hat, and his large belly that almost blocked his face from my view before he bent over and revealed an initially surprised look that quickly turned into a gentlemanly smile. Archibald Snatcher.[Chapter 4] Free Pepper Chapter 3 \"What is this?\" His voice made me tremble. Archibald Snatcher firstly reminded me of a giant; this tall, terrible figure who would much sooner step on me for taking his golden goose than have a cup of tea with me and talk about it. I tried to back away, but I was stopped in my tracks by the trash cans and barrel behind me. Every step he took, and every clack of his shoes made me tongue tied and graceless. \"I-I-I…\" I sat my cheese down on my lap as he rose his eyebrows at my careless stutter. His eyes confused me greatly. His face just seemed neutral. He didn't look angry, upset, or scarier than how he'd been the night before. \"Hmm…\" he began. \"A child hiding from the Boxtrolls, no doubt.\" He rose back up to his feet and put a hand to his cheek. \"But, no, that can't be. Children in this town know better than to be out of their beds past curfew.\" I looked all around me. My heart pounded faster the longer he looked at me. \"W-w-well, it-it-it's just that-\" \"Yesssss?\" My eyes widened and I froze at him. \"I-I tried to get a place to stay, b-b-but the Inn wouldn't kicked me out. I-I came into town last night, and I didn't know what to do! I-\" \"Hush, hush,\" he replied in a soft yet sharp tone. \"You want those filthy monsters to hear you?\" I covered my mouth with a hand and shook my head. \"Now,\" he continued. He tightened his necktie and took his hat off, revealing a bald spot surrounded by thinning hair, just as greased looking as the end tips I first saw last night. \"You say you came in last night?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. He smiled, and it was absolutely diabolical. It reminded me of a sore winner after achieving victory at an intense game. \"Well, then…\" he drawled. My insides turned and my heart ran wild at what he could've meant. \"I'm afraid you came at a most inopportune time. No one is permitted to be out at this time of night lest something dreadful should happen.\" His stare turned serious and cold, like a parent subtly telling a child like me that she was in the wrong. \"Very naughty, young lady,\" he spoke down towards me, waving his finger and 'tsk'ing with his tongue. \"Now, if I may…\" he offered his arm to me, causing me to flinch and block my body with my hands. I bowed my head as he chuckled at me. \"It's quite alright, my dear. Take ahold.\" I glanced at his hand and found the dazzling rings on his fingers; a large one with a yellow topaz on one hand, and three smaller, but still smooth and impressive brown ones on the other hand. Maybe they were the reason I took it and allowed him to lift me up. Though my head was down, and I rubbed my neck nervously the way I often did, I kept my eyes on him, fearful that should I turn away, something worse might happen. It certainly didn't help that he kept his hand in mine. \"B-b-but I didn't even know there was one until this morning.\" I tried to pull my hand away but his grip grew a little tighter. \"It certainly seems that way,\" he drawled. He still smiled though and leaned forward. I almost couldn't control my gasp as I threw my head down and closed my eyes shut. Please don't hurt me. That cold, long hand I'd felt just moments before touched my head. I opened my eyes and looked up. I'm surprised he didn't seem to notice the sweat running down my face. Or maybe he did and just chose not to acknowledge it. \"But I understand, Miss. I shan't hold it against you, lovely lady.\" I sighed a little too loudly. \"Thank you, sir.\" Wait a minute. Did he just call me 'lovely'? \"However…\" My lips parted. \"I simply cannot allow someone so young and apparently so delightful to be left to fend for herself at this dangerous hour. I shall escort you to a safe place myself.\" \"But, sir, I'm...I'm, I'm alone, sir. I travel, you see. I don't need a place...b-but thank you anyway,\" I stammered, silently lecturing myself for blabbering like a fool. I watched his face change as an eyebrow of his raised. I wrapped my arms around my frame and backed away a couple of steps, as I nodded my head and attempted a smile. \"A traveler? Hmm...awful young, don't you suppose?\" he asked in a calm tone of disbelief. I frantically shook my head. \"Oh, w-well I wouldn't think so. I mean, traveling is a great way to live, sir. I-I don't need to worry about anything, except where I'll be going next,\" I tried to explain. I kept on my not-too-convincing grin, but his demeanor refused to change. He put a hand to his hip. \"I don't quite agree, Miss. You belong in a family or an orphanage. Quite simple logic, none of this 'traveling' nonsense,\" he explained matter-of-factly. \"It's just that...I was thinking that maybe I could-I don't know-keep traveling…perhaps I should go...I've taken too much of your time. And that of those Boxtrolls-\" I turned to the side of him and took a couple of steps forward. Then, he blocked my way. \"Boxtrolls?\" he asked with an air of ominous curiosity. \"Y-yes...I saw some searching through some garbage...they looked...not too bad, I think...Anyway I wonder if...sir, are you alright?\" The exterminator's face suddenly turned into a mixture of shock and fear. He stared for a minute or so, looking at me as if I had just said an extremely ugly word. His eyes traveled left and right as he stroked his necktie. His mind was turning. I could tell. \"'Not too bad'? Oh-ho deary, deary me, look what they've done,\" he uneasily chuckled. He almost hovered right over me, and I could feel the anxiety within me at each step. I tried to scurry away from him as I breathily shuddered. \"Who?\" I asked timidly. The man's eyes were awfully hard to read. \"Those Boxtrolls have misled you, my dear!\" \"They...have?\" \"Of course they have! Those pests are, unfortunately, quite the tricky ones.\" he turned to the side and waved his hand in emphasis. As he talked, he sounded all the more confident. Soon enough, he was back to how he'd been before; intimidating and impossible to escape from. \"Especially with their younger victims. But that's the way of monsters,\" he peered back at me. \"...manipulating them before ultimately coming in for the kill.\" \"The kill? Younger victims?\" I wasn't sure why, but I stopped and listened intently, and he seemed happy about it. \"Of course! They prefer children...not as strong and fast,\" he hissed all the while giving me a seemingly sombre look. It seemed all too real. What if he's right? After all, he knows them better than I do. \"My dear?\" I flinched and nodded to him. He smirked. \"Yes, sir?\" He lowered himself to one knee to be on my level and pulled me just a little closer to him. He looked at my hand and kept that awful smirk. \"Now is no time for exchanging facts and stories. The monsters are crawling about everywhere and you seem to lack a place to turn to. Luckily for you, I'm feeling quite compassionate.\" He gestured towards himself rather dramatically. We locked eyes and were almost small, round nose to pointed, crooked nose. My heart almost ripped itself out of my chest at my space being invaded by such a man. \"You don't have to do anything, sir…\" I said with as I gave a little pull on my captive hand. \"I'm a gentleman, Miss. It is my duty to assist such a young, fragile lady. Poor thing, alone, naive, and in need of help.\" His grip tightened. \"I know a place where you can find yourself some rest from all of your 'traveling' so to speak. An indestructible fortress where the monsters wouldn't dream to tread. It would be an honor to prevent another unfortunate monstrous incident to befall the one who least deserves it.\" \"But I don't know you,\" I almost whispered. \"Better to be assisted by a great man than mauled to death by a pest.\" I took a deep breath. \"I-I it-it just doesn't seem right...is this even...proper?\" The man leaned back, widened his own eyes, and put a hand to his chest. \"Why, my lady, you're not suggesting that a respectable man would even dream of doing anything 'improper' to one such as yourself, are you?\" His face was very sly and his breath was hot and reminded me of the trash around me. I held my free hand to right below my chin to pinch my nose, but that last comment he made completely pulled that thought out of my mind; so much so, I could control my gasp towards it. \"N-n-no, no, forgive me, sir, please! I'm-I'm a little confused, I guess…\" I looked down ashamed. I think he could tell by my frazzled approach to he tried to tell me. \"Mmm...you're tired and in a strange place. It's hard to think straight in such a state.\" He tilted my chin so that I could look at him. He gave me a sorry looking lip quiver. It looked not-so-much fake, as it was theatrically sympathetic, but it quickly faded as he pointed to himself once again. \"You should be lucky that such an esteemed man has offered to go out of his way to give so much to you. Now stop acting foolishly and come. I have a great deal of work to do, and the creatures are about.\" His eyes narrowed at me. \"The choice is yours, Miss. A warm, indestructible fortress or a cold, monstrous night alone?\" Though his tone sounded understanding, he pierced me with his intense gray eyed gaze complete with a crooked toothed smile. I quivered my lip and allowed my mind to process it all, searching for some sort of excuse, but he still seemed just far too strong for me. No excuse would be enough. Something seemed so wrong about this. In London, I'd never once seen a girl as young as me be in the company of a man that wasn't a family member; very out of the ordinary, from what I've heard and seen. On one hand, I could bite him, throw the trashcans in his path, and hurry out of town, back into the hills surrounding it. But on the other hand, I was trapped. Large garbage cans and barrels behind me and a terrifying man in front of me; but though he appeared scary, to say the least, he knew so much. I could tell by the way he talked and emphasized his points. His gestures and knowledge surrounding these trolls suggested his legitimacy. I'd never been fond of being out in the cold all night. That, and being called 'lovely' didn't hurt that much either. \"I guess...one night wouldn't hurt.\" He grinned at me, put my hand on his arm, and escorted me out of that alleyway. I could feel my head begin to spin, and my heart beat up my insides as my legs shivered no thanks to the cool, yet silent wind. \"My name's Pepper.\" He looked at me, and with that strange looking smirk, the exterminator stopped, and kissed my hand. And though I couldn't understand why, my face tingled and turned pink, and the worst part was I didn't even know for sure why. The uncertainty, his means of persuasion, and now his germs on my hand made me feel woozy in the head. But I couldn't reject him now, even as the world, minus him strangely enough, vigorously spun around me. \"Mr. Archibald Snatcher, at your service.\"[Chapter 5] Free Pepper Chapter 4 I found myself in a world of blankets the following morning, waking up from a night that quickly turned into a blur. I rested on the bed, with my cheek stuck to my pillow as I tried to recollect what had happened. I was hiding in a barrel on the streets of Cheesebridge. But someone found me and convinced me to go with him. I was taken by a gentleman, who made me so scared and stressed, that my world went black as we approached a street corner. \"Miss?...Whatever's the matter?\" He asked. My vision turned fuzzy, my heart almost ripped out of my chest and I fell to the ground, completely out cold. He must have taken me here, yet here I was in this strange dark bedroom. I sat up in the bed and rubbed my eyes. The bed I laid in was full sized with one pillow, and a set of sheets arranged from thinnest to thickest. The thinnest sheets were a creamy white color but the comforter on top was a dark gray, almost black. A bed table sat beside the bed with one lamp and thankfully my bag. On the opposite wall facing the bed was a window with just as gray curtains. To both my left and right were doors, with the left one standing much closer to me than the right. A third door I noticed last was open and held random clothes on hangers, and sitting in the corner between the closet and the window was a cage; possibly a spare one for Boxtrolls. I flipped over my covers and hopped out of bed. I hurried over to the window and pushed the curtains away to find that my room was in a very high up place. The river to my right I'd seen two nights before stretched along the land surrounding my room, and to the left was the town. \"Am I...in the factory?\" I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. The factory was topped with a Red Hat, like him and his men. A meeting place if I'd ever seen one. \"Wait...\" I thought. \"...who would live in a factory?\" Somebody who can afford it, I supposed. I looked over at the left door by my bed. I curiously opened it and stared. It was a complete bathroom, and it seemed as if it hadn't been used in a real long time. It wasn't dirty or anything, just older. It was small but not cramped and at least when I tried every knob, the water ran. I stared at myself in the mirror over the sink and though I tried to smile, it would just melt into a frown seconds later, and I wished I knew why. I checked my closet next. It was much smaller but I didn't mind that too much. All I had was my satchel and the clothes on my back anyway. I tried to smile again. \"A washroom, and a closet, and a bed,\" I told myself. \"Surely there's nothing wrong with that.\" And yet, it felt wrong. Something about this whole situation seemed unbelievably bad. I got to thinking about the man who found me last night, Archibald Snatcher. I looked toward the last door in my room. It surely had to lead to him somehow, and my face flushed up an embarrassing pink color. That feeling one gets from making a drastic decision and then coming to regret it later, and I was feeling that to the point where I just had to dive back into bed. Maybe if I disguise myself with sheets, he won't find me, and forget all about me. I wrapped myself in sheets as last night's conversation rang in my ears. I clutched them at his display of charm and his horrible smile that worried me so. As it played out in my mind, a thought came to my head. \"He really wanted me to come...,\" I thought to myself. \"...just pushing and pushing. I tried to say 'no',\" I quickly realized. \"So why can't I do even that...\" There was a look in his eyes; it wouldn't have surprised me if he could turn from nice and calm to dark and monstrous in less than a second. Had he ever been used to being told 'no'? He didn't seem like it. If I had said that one little word in a firm, perhaps vicious tone, would Mr. Snatcher have done something bad? Would he have taken my things? Or drag me away without a choice? Will he...hurt me? Maybe it was for the best that I allowed him to take me. I helped him stay happy, so at least he was nice, even as I fainted before him. Great job, Pepper; way to act all weak and timid in front of a man; a real one. Even if it was Archibald Snatcher. I sat up in my bed as another thought came to mind. \"What did I just let him do?\" \"Pepper, you're insane!\" A voice inside me said. \"You have no idea what he's done to you! This man approached a young, defenseless girl, offered his hand to take her to a strange place that's not the police or any other kind of official service place, and managed to talk her into leaving with him.\" There's a word for something like that. Am I judging him too harshly? Sure he looks like a bad man, but appearances aren't everything. Maybe if he finds me, I'll try to talk to him. Perhaps he is nice and he just doesn't show it the way others do. That very moment, I stopped and prayed that this was the case. But even after all of that praying, I still had that nagging feeling that something was wrong with this whole thing. What was so bad about leaving with an important gentleman anyway? He serves this town every night, according to my new friends. He searches for monsters from sundown to sunup, troll-napping them and destroying them for what they- I stopped. Napping? As in \"taking something\"? Taking trolls...and then me? I trembled in my bed, my eyes wide with horror. I've been kidnapped. I shot up out of bed and scrambled to my feet. \"I've got to get out of here! My bag! Where's my bag?!\" I searched all over the room. Luckily, I remembered finding it on my bed table, so I swiped it and approached the third door. Whatever was behind this door, I had to hold my breath and brace myself for it. I turned the knob and pushed it open. I found a long straight hallway lit up by candles hanging on the wall. I took short breaths and ran as fast as I could down the long narrow way. The light at the end of the hall was brighter than all the others, and so I hoped and prayed my route to freedom would be there. Sprinting to the end of the hall, I found a platform with metallic railing that I almost fell over. Thankfully my feet stopped the moment I realized where I was going. The hallway brought me to the very top of a set of stairs, which led to the largest room in the factory; a wide space complete with hanging cages, a generator most likely, a set of levers, and a little corner with a modest dining table, cabinets, a laundry line, and a potbelly stove. I didn't bother to look around much, for I practically soared down the stairs. My eyes constantly traveled in search for yet another door, though the only good thing I could think of at this moment was how lucky I was to know that no one was around right then and there. I could finally hurry to the other end of the factory, rip open the door and run. I didn't think of where. Just run. I touched the knob to the entrance of the factory, turned it, and nothing happened. I pulled and turned as strongly as I could but nothing could get my only means of escape open. Part of me felt ready to faint again, but I couldn't. \"Stay awake and get out! Stay awake and get out!\" was all my voice had left to say. Sweat fell down my face at the thought of the worst coming to fruition. And it made me all the more determined to break the door down. Clack, clack, clack... I have to be the biggest crybaby in the world, because despite how hard I tried to rip the door apart, nothing worked. And all I could do was weep about how stupid I'd been. Clack, clack, clack... But I had to eye the door knob knowing that I couldn't look away. Was I missing something? Surely there must be a way to get this door open. My desire to stay free and alive made me study it intently. There had to be something. \"Miss.\" But I had no time to figure out why it could've been. At the sound of a masculine voice, I spun around and quickly swiped my face with my arms. I didn't want him to see my tears. \"H-hello, sir.\" Lacking his red hat, Mr. Snatcher watched me intently as he stepped down the stairs. His hand slid down the rail like a snake getting ready to snap down on a mouse. His other hand straightened his brown vest and necktie. The look on his face bothered me because he wasn't necessarily scowling, but he did give me a suspicious face. I took my hand off my door knob, put my hands behind my back, and gave him a teary eyed smile. \"What are you doing?\" \"...Umm...\" He twirled down the bottom of the stairs and strutted towards me. I backed away but much like last night, something stopped me from behind; that infernal door. \"I was just walking myself out. I think I've overstayed my welcome.\" He towered over me like a skyscraper the nearer he came to me. \"Without a goodbye? Not very courteous,\" he replied, a sad, yet fake look plastered on his face. \"You've-you've done so much for me already. And I'm sure you're a very busy man. You don't need a kid hanging around when you've got things to do.\" As I smiled, I bit my lip. He tapped his finger to his chin and turned towards the windows on the opposite wall, parallel to the stairs. \"Hmm...how strange,\" he muttered as he pulled out a round gold watch from his inner coat pocket, clicked it open and glanced at it. \"The sun is still out. I have 4 hours before the pests show up...\" He tucked the watch back into his coat and smiled at me. \"I have plenty of time before then.\" \"Only 4 hours? How long was I asleep?\" \"B-but I don't-\" I looked down and stared at my twiddling fingers. I locked my eyes on them and fell silent for a considerable amount of time. As I tried to figure out what to say, I stayed there until I felt something long and cold on my shoulders. \"But aren't you hungry, Miss?\" He lightly pushed me towards the stairs from behind. \"You've had such a long two days, and it would be beneath me to let a lady go without.\" He must have felt me tremble because his fingers clutched my shoulders a little more tightly. \"But, sir, I-\" \"I insist!\" I closed my eyes shut and tried to think. But my thoughts were interrupted by a door opening. We both turned and my eyes widened as a man entered through the door I wanted desperately to go through. \"Aah, Mr. Gristle, your timing is perfect!\" \"Nice...\" The short imp was carrying a ring of keys in his hand as he smiled at Mr. Snatcher. \"M-Mr. Gristle?\" I took a step towards him and the now unlocked door, but Mr. Snatcher placed his hand on my neck and collarbone region and held me back. The imp locked eyes at me and kept them there. \"This is the young lady I told you about, Miss Pepper. My lady, this is Mr. Gristle, my most trusted Red Hat!\" His boss said. The manic little man smiled. \"SALT!\" I frowned at him over the most repetitive joke I've ever heard. \"No, I'm Pepper,\" I bluntly told him. \"Oh, t'is a joke, Miss. After you fell asleep and I put you to bed, I told him and the rest of my men all about you. There are no strangers here, my dear.\" \"Mr. Snatcher put me to bed last night?\" I blushed a terrible shade of pink. \"I-I see.\" He held my shoulders and continued to lead me towards the staircase, that unlocked door getting farther away with each agonizing inch. Bite him! Slap him! Run! But where? He led me to the steps and grasped my hand as I took the first one. \"My dear, how would it be, if you would wash up and change? Be back down here in two hours, will you?\" I tried to pull my hand away but his long fingers, despite how thin they were, kept it bound. \"I suppose I can,\" I softly replied. \"You remember the way?\" He asked. \"I think so.\" \"Remember,\" he said. \"Two hours.\" \"I will, sir,\" I returned. I warily climbed up the steps, feeling his gaze weigh upon my shoulders as I went. I looked back over one of my shoulders and saw Mr. Snatcher and Mr. Gristle together. It looked like the former was speaking to the latter about me; I could tell because Mr. Snatcher was gesturing towards me as he whispered to his underling. Worried that he might try something if he saw me watching, I ran down the hallway once I made it until I made it to my bedroom. I slammed and locked my door closed and searched all around me, and suddenly spotted my window. Of course! My window! I hurried past the cage, right over to it, pushed on it, but nothing happened. Gasping, I found a keyhole onto the latch that kept the window closed and locked. That man locked almost everything. I even bothered to look through to remind myself how high I was off the ground. My eyes practically bulged from my sockets at how far up I was. That man couldn't have put these rooms on the bottom floor close to my means of escape. I stared at my unmade bed and felt my skin tingle with grief. I couldn't let him see me cry, but being in this lonely locked bedroom where he couldn't catch me was better than being in the same place with him, in which he could. Another teardrop came and they just wouldn't stop. If only I was stronger. If only I was braver. Being smarter wouldn't be so bad either. I laid on my stomach, throwing my face into my pillow and just shedding a waterfall of tears. My bed dampened, all I could do was beat up and kick my pillows, scream and wail in agony, and yell at myself. You're such a stupid girl. How could you let a frightening man just take you like that? What if you're stuck with him forever? I rubbed my red puffy face and sniffed the hand I used, and as much as I hated to admit it, Mr. Snatcher was right. I hadn't had a proper bath in about two weeks during my greatly desired travels. I sighed and entered my bathroom. Twisting the knobs of my bathtub, I found a bottle of shampoo and a bar of soap, so I figured I'd use those. As the tub filled up with water, I looked at my skin while unbuttoning my shirt, and realized how sooty it was. I cringed at my appearance, but I wasn't sure why. Was it because I was putting my boys' clothes, rather than girls' clothes, on the bathroom counter? Am I embarrassed at being such a filthy, young girl while in his company? But why should I care? I couldn't stand that man, yet being so filthy around this gentleman of sorts at the same time made me feel self conscious. The water felt pretty warm as I sunk inside it, and as much as I couldn't stand my situation, it felt rather nice. Watching my dirty blotches fall away from me gave me a strange sense of relief, not to mention a minute or two to think. Maybe if I try to explain to Mr. Snatcher how I feel and convince him that I won't say a word about what I know or have seen, he'll let me leave. He might even listen if I ask him NOT to escort me anywhere. I won't even use the 'K' word.[Chapter 6] Free Pepper Chapter 5 I stared at myself in the mirror. My two hours were almost up. I put on wearing a clean outfit from the closet. More boys' clothes, but they were a bit larger than the dirty ones I had before. The trousers were a dark brown and the shirt was a lighter brown with long sleeves. I had to use a belt to keep my pants up and because the loose shirt left the top of my chest bare, I kept lifting it, so that it was entirely covered. Again, why was I so self aware now? But I had no choice. I took a deep breath and unlocked my door. I'm on a death march, it seemed. Each step felt like I was walking on a high wire. One little mistake, and something awful will surely happen. The light at the end of the hallway would have been more welcomed if it was the afterlife. My weeks of traveling through the country has weakened me to the point where my life has come to an end from all the hard work and stress, crashing my body into nothing but dust. But no, it wasn't Heaven, and it wasn't Hell. Whether I should've been sad that it wasn't any of those or not was beyond me. \"There you are!\" My shoulders twitched involuntarily at that low, yet loud voice. I found myself at the end of the hall and there below me and over the railing was Mr. Snatcher. He stood up straight and tall, and seemed to have combed his hair and polished his rings. \"Come on down. Don't be shy!\" He beckoned me with his ring clad hand, and as much as I wanted to run or at the very least beg for mercy, I came down the stairs at a steady pace. I soon picked up a smell; an unmistakable aroma. My eyes traveled towards the table. I found a two plates on the table. I came to a slow stop and just stared at them. There was a smaller plate and a larger one, each with some sort of cooked meat, potatoes, and vegetables. Right by them were a teapot, two teacups, a cup of sugar with spoons, and a pair of saucers. How this was put together in two hours, I honestly didn't know, but I didn't care. It was real food, and I embraced the look and smell of it. \"My dear, I'm not getting any younger,\" his tone was a little sharper than before, and so I quickened my paced. I tapped down the steps one by one and all I could do was keep my eyes on them. Grasping the banister with all the life I had, I planted my feet firmly at the end of the stairs and took a breath. My lips dampened with drool, but the very idea of him seeing me with it made me wipe my lips vigorously. I turned my head away and ran my arm past my lips. My eyes glanced back and forth from the floor to my arm. My body trembled at what he might think if he saw me practically longing for what I found on that table. His hand took my shoulder closest to him. My head spun around and I immediately threw my hand from my mouth, and straightened up. \"Miss Pepper, please sit down,\" he gestured towards the table. \"You must be hungry from such a long journey.\" He offered his arm again, and I really wished he hadn't. \"Thank you. I am,\" I shakily told him. If I hadn't taken his arm, I didn't even know what he would have done, so I took it, and prayed that I wouldn't even faint again. The velvet texture in his jacket provided something for me to look at. He pulled out the chair closest to the smaller plate, offered it as a seat and pushed it towards the table once I sat down. I stared at my feet, a little intrigued that they weren't even touching the floor. Though my chair was a simple rectangle, the chair right next to me, was much taller and elegantly carved with velvet, red cushions, oval shaped ears, a circular top rail also covered in velvet (most of it anyway), and to top it all off, velvet arm rests. Everything about this strange man seemed so important; his clothes, his possessions, and even this factory he live in (odd as it was), he had to be awfully important if he had all of these things. But then I stopped. I had to remind myself that I was going to try and get away from him. \"Remember the game plan, Pepper.\" He sat in the nicer looking chair (I'm calling it The Boss Chair because it looked much fancier than the other plainer rectangular chairs) right next to me, and poured me a cup of tea. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome, Miss.\" Tucking a napkin into his shirt hiding underneath his vest, I glued my eyes onto my own plate of food. As I eyed it, I warily took my fork, stabbed my chunk of meat, and lifted it to my mouth. I sunk my teeth into the entire thing, and tried to pull on it. \"Ahem.\" Out of fear, I didn't look up at Mr. Snatcher, but I did freeze at the clearing of his throat. In the corner of my eye, I could see an offended look on his ovular face, so I dropped my fork and held my hands up in surrender. His face turned neutral again as he stayed completely still. I noticed when he finally injected his own meat with his fork, cut it delicately with his knife, and took a bite. I watched his knife and fork movements and noticed how daintily he ate the large portions on his plate. A minute or two of watching him must have notified him. \"Please, my dear. Start,\" he smiled, but I chose instead to focus on my food and imitate him. Cutting my beef with my knife, I took a bite with my fork and something inside me snapped. Each mouthful of beef just made me eat it faster and faster. I may have been in a strange place with a shady man, but real food is real food; plain and simple. As much as I couldn't say that this was the best dinner in the world, a lack of real food for an awfully long time made me feel desperate for a little while. Even the cooked vegetables, which I don't normally like, I just couldn't help but inhale. \"Miss Pepper,\" he chuckled at me, so I stopped almost instantly. \"This isn't a race.\" I blushed a little bit and I hated it. \"I'm sorry, sir. It's been a long time since I've had something like this. Th-thank you again, by the way.\" I could sense an amused smile on my face. \"Well, I'm happy to be the one to satisfy your appetite.\" Something about the way he said that made me squirm, but it reminded me all the more of my task at hand. After a few more minutes of nothing but the two of us enjoying dinner, I finally decided on the best thing to start out my means of an exit with. \"Mr. Snatcher?\" \"Yes?\" \"Umm...thank you for the bed too. It was nice.\" \"Oh, you're quite welcome. I was hoping you would.\" His deep tones made me a little fearful, but I had to use a firm tone on my own. \"I did. But it'll also be nice to get back on the road again.\" The man looked at me, but I refused to acknowledge him. \"But why would you want to?\" \"Because I like it, sir.\" \"Come now, Miss. You don't truly like this 'life on the road' so to speak? Wandering around through the rain, no home, not even a bed. As I said before, it's nonsense,\" he explained waving his free hand about. \"Well, sir, it's better than before, and nothing can say it isn't,\" I replied defensively. He didn't seem too pleased with my response as he made a slightly annoyed voice. I turned frigid. \"Hmm, please explain.\" \"It-it-it doesn't matter, sir.\" My shoulders were tugged down by his stare. I sunk a little deeper into my chair, and pondered over why he would even care. \"Well,\" he resumed. \"It certainly must if someone like you would go out of her way to run off and remain on her own. How old are you exactly, child?\" \"Six and a half, sir.\" \"Six? My, my, so alone, so young; where did you come from?\" \"London.\" \"Aah, yes, the Queen's city. Wonderful town,\" he replied in a matter of fact kind of tone. \"Why would you leave such a place? And please,\" he took my cheek and tilted it up. But I wouldn't look at him. \"...don't be afraid to look at me, young lady. If anyone is going to speak with me, I prefer eye contact,\" he sounded very condescending, but his weighing gaze had finally won, and so I met it with my own. There were a few moments of silence. \"Well, I'm waiting...\" he warned. He drank a bit of his tea. \"Oh! Well, umm, I lived in London all the time. There's this great, big orphanage right by the Thames where I slept...only for girls actually. None of the girls there were used to being around men...I haven't talked to very many myself. Some of the ladies running it were kind of mean; they always thought I was getting into trouble...ugly old bats...only a couple of them really...I'd get blamed for stuff, so they didn't like me at all. The leader of the orphanage, Miss Andrews, she liked us though, but I guess it was because she owns the place. She was nice, I guess. I liked walking 'round the docks, and watching the sailors come in and out. People would look at me funny because...well...I was a lonely kid wandering around, I don't know...some of the grownups, even some of their kids, would give me those looks. I'm a 'thief' and a 'yobbo', so they say. And it'd happen whenever I went to any place other than the docks.\" \"Are you a thief?\" Mr. Snatcher asked curiously, his eyes glued on me with a suspicious gleam in them. \"No!\" I widened my eyes at my outburst. \"S-sorry...\" His eyes were hard to read. Was he angry? Sad? It was hard to say. He was silent for a few seconds though. \"Hmm...please continue.\" \"Well, I met an older girl who'd been pulling into the pier with her parents one time, Genevieve, and we did lots of things together. She's a super wealthy Spaniard too! People liked her, and she'd stick up for me when they'd see me coming. She gave me lots of money so that I could pay for things. Not enough to afford a real dress and shoes...I've always wanted some of those...\" I looked down as I thought about her. \"But, my dear, why did you leave?\" \"Because I was sick of everyone...Two weeks ago, I told Genevieve that I wanted to, so she gave me lots of money.\" \"You? A little orphan like you has lots of money?\" he asked with a curved eyebrow. \"Well, I...yes, I do...and then I left.\" \"Did you know where you were going?\" \"Not really...I knew I was going south though. I just wished they were nicer. They think I'm no one special, so I wanted to prove them wrong. I can make it on my own. I'll get my own dress and buckled shoes.\" Even though he casually ate his food during this whole conversation, I could tell he was listening intently. His face was neutral, his eyes were stuck on me, and as much as I hated to admit it, the more I explained my story, the more comfortable I felt discussing it. But why did it have to be Archibald Snatcher? He rubbed his lips with his napkin. He placed it on his plate and leaned back as I observed it; that was an awful lot of food, but who am I to judge? He cleared his throat, and it became clear to me that it was my turn to eat, and his turn to talk. \"My dear, I'm afraid you are quite misled.\" I gave him an aggravated look. Again, why him? \"Oh really?\" As I ate the rest of my dinner, I let him continue. When I felt him put a hand on my shoulder, I stared at him as my spine tingled. \"You're not the only one surrounded by dolts who don't understand. I know how you feel, Miss.\" I arched my eyebrows at him. \"How?\" He looked at his nails with a curled smile. \"Well, for one thing, I long for so much more and far better, myself.\" \"Really?\" \"Why, yes, now are you familiar with the White Hats in this town?\" \"Yes, I made some new friends yesterday who told me that they solve problems around the town.\" \"Very true, Miss, but did they tell you what else they can do? White Hats are the elite gentlemen who taste cheese from far and wide. They all meet together in the Tasting Room at our...\" he pulled on his necktie left and right rather subtly. \"'beloved' Mayor's home. It is a highly respected position that I shall join soon enough.\" \"Yeah, but how are you getting a White Hat?\" Mr. Snatcher's face changed. He smiled smugly and sipped some more of his tea. \"By exterminating the Boxtrolls, of course. His Lordship and I have an agreement. Once every one of those lowly vermin is gone, I will take my place alongside the elite,\" he balled his hand into a fist, and stared at it ambitiously. \"Are Boxtrolls really that bad?\" Mr. Snatcher looked at me annoyingly. \"My dear girl, why don't you understand? Boxtrolls are grotesque pests. The bane of this town's existence.\" His annoyed look turned dark and his voice even lower than usual. I leaned back a little in my chair. He glanced at my fearful face. \"Every night, those creatures think of nothing but how to bring this town to ruin.\" He leaned forward and used his hands to elaborate. \"Stealing little girls and boys from their beds, dragging them down to their disgusting caves, gnawing on their bones, ripping their innards, and drinking their blood.\" My eyes were wider than plates. \"He can't be serious.\" \"And that's not even the worst part!\" \"It's not?\" I whimpered. \"Certainly not! Their sharp teeth are perfect for biting off your hands and knees and chewing off your feet.\" \"But how can that-\" \"And when there's nothing left of you, they throw the rest of you into their mountains of bones and rivers of blood! And then they'll do it all over again. The crushing, the gnawing, the chopping of little hands!\" \"STOP IT!\" I fell out of my chair and scurried under the table. I bowed, covered my eyes with my hands, and shuddered. As his legs and clunky shoes hovered over my head, I was just too upset and scared to give them any attention for the time being. When I did look up after a minute or two, I saw that his legs were cross-legged and the majority of his stomach laid there in his lap. I wiped my face of my tears with my hands and watched as he uncrossed his legs, pushed his chair back and stood up. Were those Boxtrolls really monsters, I wondered. His details were gruesome but it was hard to just disregard them. But I sincerely wished that I could. \"Please don't eat me,\" I whispered to myself. \"Miss Pepper, come out,\" his voice called out. \"I can't, sir,\" I replied. \"And why not?\" \"I'm...well...\" \"Young lady, there's nothing to fear here. Now come out.\" I hated his firm tone, but I knew I couldn't ignore him. I got on my hands and knees, crawled towards his side of the table, and lifted the table cloth. \"Here I am.\" He smiled at me and offered his hand. I rubbed my nose and cheek. \"Now, now, that's enough of that.\" He reached into another inner coat pocket of his, pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to me. I dried my face with it and gave it back to him. \"I'm just trying to help you see the truth of the matter.\" I stood up straight and tall and took a deep breath, but looked up at him when he started speaking again. \"Now, I've spoken with our Mayor, Lord Portley-Rind, recently, and...\" his look traveled back towards me, and a great sense of dread overwhelmed me. \"I have realized something quite-\" he leaned back in his chair as if thinking. \"-obvious, but fascinating.\" \"And what thing might that be?\" His smile looked awfully discomforting at this point. I wasn't quite sure how much more of this I can take. I nibbled on my lip as he took my hand. \"Our current White Hats may think they're 'special' so to speak, but they have brought to my attention a key to their success that, for the longest time, I haven't considered. Behind them is a proper family. An obedient wife and children to make it all worth while.\" He walked me back to the table, turned the Boss Chair around, and sat there. I stood right before him, fearing the worst. He wasn't suggesting what I thought he was suggesting, was he? \"And since I am a great man deserving of a prize as important as a White Hat, I certainly can't stand the possibility of lacking anything else important for any reason. Ever since my little talk with His Lordship, I've been thinking, and I suppose it is time to consider such things.\" He wouldn't dare. \"Perhaps it is time to bring someone into this factory of mine whom I can home to every morning after another valiant night of purging the streets of those beasts. Someone I can provide for; maybe a dress and a pair of buckled shoes for a young girl who has no one and, if I may say so, nowhere to turn to. A daughter, it is turning out to be, because I choose you. Congratulations.\" I have to get out of this town. Taking a couple of steps back, I tried to say something, but nothing could come out. I just had to say something. I cringed at being right in front of him again, but I had to be firm with him. \"Sir, I don't think that I'd be a good...'daughter' I guess. I have a lot of places to go and people to meet. It would be better if I moved onto the next town. Those Boxtrolls won't find me there. Th-thank you for all of this again. But I need to go. I can take of myself.\" His smile faded, and I felt butterflies in me. Not the good kind I feel around people I really like (James came to mind and I missed him terribly), but the bad kind that tells me that something terrible is happening. He didn't look angry or sad. He appeared neutral again. Mr. Snatcher stood back up to full height, again towering over me, and making me back away a couple more steps. \"Very well.\" I sighed in relief and looked towards the steps. \"I need to go upstairs and get my bag. I'd like to get on the road before the trolls come out.\" \"Of course.\" I tried to convince him not to go up with me but he insisted on walking me up the stairs and then out the door anyway. As we climbed up the stairs together, I kept my head turned away from him. I could sense his disappointment. He was unhappy, but at least he was understanding. \"You know, Miss, I have to admit. You're not like most young ladies I've ever seen. Giggling, silly little things waiting for the day a man comes to court them.\" \"I guess I'm just different.\" \"I quite agree.\" He smiled humorously and chuckled after a moment or two. \"What's so funny, sir?\" \"Despite the circumstances in which I found you, I think you are very amusing.\" \"Me?\" \"You. That little image of a child sitting in an alley nibbling cheese like a mouse.\" The man snickered with a hand to his lips. \"I'd never seen anything so pitiful yet humorous at the same time!\" I smiled. Doing that towards him surprised me. Maybe if I leave Mr. Snatcher in good spirits, it'll help me get out of here quicker. \"You're not the only one who thinks so, sir. Some of the girls and the grownups in my orphanage too called me that! I nibble my food a lot. I was hiding in garbage anyway, just like real ones!\" I exclaimed. \"Aha!\" He pointed at me dramatically. I leaned away from him but I still smiled. And it felt real. \"Just as I suspected!\" He continued as we entered the hallway together. \"A little mouse scurrying about the trash...are cats a problem for you?\" he asked with a sly look, but I felt a little clueless. But then I bursted. \"Oh, ho! Yes!\" He and I just laughed and laughed. Tears of joy ran down my face as Mr. Snatcher took my hand and pulled me towards my room. I looked up at him and amidst the laughter, he dabbed his teary eyes with his handkerchief. As we walked and cackled, I took a mental note of his subtly shaking belly and mouth wide open revealing gnarly teeth and various gaps between them. I looked down at the floor and closed my eyes. Chortling at my situation, I could feel freedom coming so close, I practically felt it reaching towards my hands. I just had to grab my satchel, thank him one last time, and I'll surely be out of town before the Boxtrolls emerge to run amuck. However, as we enjoyed our funny jokes and comparisons, there was also quite a bit of our moment I didn't take mental notes of. For one, I didn't respond to him taking me into both of his arms, or the clicking and clacking I heard. And before I could calm down and ask him why, I could feel myself falling and hitting something cold, and thin, then flat and metallic. I fell then and there and let my cheek hit that flat, thin sheet of metal. I opened my eyes, and I panicked. The world around me had been turned into a pattern of thin bars that all supported a thick square also held together by bars. I shot straight up and found that they were all arranged to form an enclosed space; a cage. Breathing short breaths, I sat on my knees and planted my hands on that square; the ceiling of the cell. And as much as I couldn't stand it, I looked to the direction of more clicking, and there hovering over me from right outside my prison was Mr. Snatcher, using his own ring of keys to lock the latch on top shut. \"S-s-sir, I-\" Even as he finished sealing me in and tucked his keys away into his coat, he stayed leaning forward. \"Now look what you made me do, Miss Pepper.\" I widened my eyes. \"Please, sir, you said-\" \"I said that I had chosen you to be my daughter of sorts. I offer my home, my food, even my spare room to you, and what do you do?\" His smile evaporated. All I could see was the worst frown I'd ever seen in my life. A twisted, disgusting thing that I should've seen coming from a mile away. \"You reject my offer.\" His voice was a horrifying rumble, the kind that reminded me of the low thunder that preceded the frighteningly loud ones. \"And I simply can't have that.\" I grasped the bars and tried my hardest to bite back my new tears, now shocked and betrayed from this trap. \"But I have to leave, sir. Mr. Snatcher, please!\" \"Silence!\" His snarl at me made me back away. \"I don't want to hear anymore of this 'wandering around the world' nonsense. Your place is in a proper home like everyone else. You need one, and I need credibility with my fellow esteemed gentlemen. But before I can have that, I must have loyalty; a child I could claim for myself it now seems, who will assist me in bringing our current White Hats to the understanding that I am perfectly capable of having the support every great man would like to have as he leaves his imprint on the world.\" He looked up to the ceiling as if looking into his idealized future, spreading his arm out to elaborate, but soon enough, he looked at me threateningly again. \"And in return for such a kind offer of a roof, a place to sleep, and food to eat no less, she would be willing to do every single thing I ask of her. Every. Single. Thing. To do otherwise is the behavior of pests, and I certainly can't stand those grimy little things. That is why I keep them in cages.\" His eyes were venomous and deadly, nothing as they'd been before. Though I shook my head, part of me knew that it was all in vain. \"The idea that a timid, weak little creature like you could just waltz around living on the works of nature and important men, most of all; it's, it's laughable!\" He pointed at me, jabbing his finger into my chest as he told me these things. A few strands of hair had fallen into his face, his monstrous face that made me wish this was all just a nightmare in which I could wake up anytime now. He rose up to full height, and my tears finally won over, and each of them promptly fell down my cheeks. \"You agreed though...\" He gave me a scowl. \"I understood that you had to leave, but I certainly wasn't about to let you. Allow a moment to acquire one more thing I need to solidify my grand future to just waltz out the door? Outrageous. Now...\" He straightened his coat and vest and pushed his hair strands back behind his ear, at which I finally cared to notice that his own face was adorned with sideburns; not that, that made anything better. \"Do we have an understanding, Miss Pepper?\" \"I-I-I understand, Mr. Snatcher. I'll-I'll do it. I'll stay.\" \"Anything to get me out of this cage,\" I thought. He gave me a judgmental glance. \"Oh, no, no, that won't do at all, my dear. You clearly need more time to think it over,\" he readjusted his cuffs at the end of his coat sleeves. \"I shall give you 24 hours right here in this convenient little box to think over my proposition.\" He looked over his pocket watch. \"It is currently a quarter to 8. My men'll be expecting me. I will come back to check on you tomorrow at this very time,\" with a click of his heels and his watch back in his pocket, he bowed gentlemanly, suddenly acting as if everything was alright. \"Have a nice night, Miss Pepper.\"[Chapter 7] Free Pepper Chapter 6 I hate him. I hate him so much. I told him that many times. As he turned around and locked my bedroom door, I told him I hated him. As he walked down the hallway, I rose my volume to say that I hated him. And even as he rode off into the night on his truck, shouting \"Hear Ye! Hear Ye!\", I yelled at him, so that he'd know how much I hated him. With time, my voice grew hoarse and my cries resulted in little else but coughs, and as I banged on the bars with my fists, they too began to wear out with its repetitive patterns. Cling, cling, cling rang in my ears like bells, the worst ones I'd ever heard. One of the edges of the cage's floor, the side I'd been attacking, was damp with hot, angry tears. I no longer cared that I was a crybaby. I had every right to be at the moment. Why can't I be stronger, or braver, or smarter anyway? I clenched my bruised fists and tore my lip open with my teeth. I could sense the iron taste of blood on my tongue, and though it hurt a little, I didn't flinch anymore. But my fists and lips weren't enough. My eyes were stuck shut as I tried to think of something else to do. And I found something to do. I couldn't get out; the latch was locked shut, and the anger and hatred of him slowly turned into anger and regret towards me, so I slapped me hard. The palm of my hand made contact with my cheek because I deserved it. The sting wasn't too bad, for I was never all that strong to begin with, but I kept hitting myself with my hand. Slap, slap, slap went my palm to an increasingly red welt on my face. I felt I was too stupid to go without it. I deserved it. I didn't bite, slap, or kick him away from me. I didn't care that I was only six years old. I should have done something before he could catch me in his mousetrap. Multiple hits on my reddened cheeks felt appropriate, so I stopped after awhile and laid there on the floor of the cage and contemplated this world I'd been thrown into. With each passing hour, I realized that the hardened cell was too cold and hard for me to sleep, so all I did was lay there and think. I didn't judge him too harshly at all. My instincts were right, but did I really listen? No, or I would be in the next town by now; perhaps at the English Channel. I really will be stuck with him forever, will I? I want to believe that there is still a way out. I desired nothing more than to rip my bars apart, smash the window, tie my sheets together and run as far as possible. I wouldn't be able to say goodbye to Leona, Bryan, Skyla, Abigail, and James, but maybe I can write them a letter, explaining my dilemma to them, and then one day several years from now, when I'm too grown up to be recognized by Mr. Snatcher, I can come back and apologize to them for leaving without a goodbye. But now that I'm here in this prison, who knows when's the next time I'll ever talk to them? They were the only good things about this town and I might not have a choice in even seeing them again. My scratchy voice fell silent, and my hands took hold of my bars and I dropped my head in shame. And for the longest time, I stayed in that solemn position. My insides were in pain from the screaming, and attacks on my person. And the more I thought about them, the more I thought of that horrible man's words. He wants to keep me forever. All for this random hat that's supposed to make him even more important than he already is. Every day, I'd have to look at him; hear his hurtful tones remind me that I was to remain in this factory and make him look good in the eyes of these White topped men. And all I could do was hope and pray that he would be at the very least...what was a good way to say it...'not as mean' if I at least tried to do what he says and them see what happens from th-. I stopped and allowed my jaw to drop. \"You're crazy, Pepper! You can't just stop trying to leave,\" I scolded to myself. \"But how can I?\" I realized. Mr. Gristle and Mr. Snatcher have the keys from what I saw, and if that imp really is his most trusted Red Hat, then there won't be any convincing Mr. Gristle to do otherwise. And if the giant with the bowler hat and the beanpole are anywhere near as loyal, they won't listen to my begging for freedom either. The windows and doors would be secure and for all I knew, I was probably going to stay inside this horrid little box for a long time. Or maybe he'll let me out for good behavior. If I promise to be good and listen, maybe he'll let me sleep in my own bed tomorrow night. Or maybe he'll admit that he doesn't trust me and just keep me in here like an animal. \"Pepper, stop it!\" I thought. \"Don't you dare start doing what that man says! You don't want him to win, do you?\" But what if it's not about winning or losing? What's if it's all about trying to take freedom with dishonesty? He did it to me. Wouldn't it be something if I could do it too? \"But if you promise to be good, he'll probably ask you to do disgusting stuff! You don't want that!\" Of course, I didn't! However, if I didn't make Mr. Snatcher happy, he'll never listen or do anything about what I have to say. I can try to be good and win him over, and then hopefully he'll at least let me go out and see Cheesebridge again. Then while we're out, I can make a speedy getaway for the next town. \"I might be wrong,\" I thought. All this talk about dishonesty and listening to me, what if he has a point? He seems to know so much about the real world, and he does have a point...kind of. I was only six years old. Most children at that age are either in school because they have at least one parent to help them, or if they lacked even one like me, they're cooped up with other lonely children waiting for either one of two things to happen: the day a grownup comes to claim us, or the day we turn sixteen and are told to find our own way. And should that happen, there was always clearly something wrong with you. Sixteen years and no one came for you? Sixteen year old orphans usually had a rough time finding work, a spouse or even a proper job. Getting adopted however, meant that you had what it took to make it out there because you managed to impress someone enough to be chosen. At least, that's what people thought. I never really cared about these things...until now maybe. For all I knew, he's probably seen his own share of people falling short due to circumstances they couldn't control. \"Maybe he was one of them,\" I thought. I had ten more years until I'd have to put up with these problems. But still, I've been told that time can roll by pretty fast. I guess that was another good reason to get on the road. I could live a life of freedom and make my own choices...all alone...with my dirty clothes and body...no friends...not even a bed. Mr. Snatcher was right about that. He was right about a lot of things, wasn't he? Six year olds need to have a place to go. Even if it is a factory...no, that can't be right...I'm stuck here against my will. But if it weren't for him, sure I'd be by myself again, but what if something bad had happened on the road too? What if I'd hurt myself and I was still in town? A troll might have caught me...those bone gnashing creatures with their razor sharp teeth. Mr. Snatcher didn't have razor sharp teeth. There were significant gaps sure, but he never tried to bite me or tear me to pieces. \"Yes, but he did cage you. Don't you forget that,\" I thought to myself. Mr. Snatcher doesn't seem like to type who'd gnash and gnaw and add me to a river of blood or a mountain of bones. He did seem like the type who might eat me though, especially when he hovers over me and stares at me with those stone gray eyes. It wouldn't have surprised me if he'd told me that he could and would for such an 'ungrateful' attitude. And the worst part was that he might've been right. If he had called me 'ungrateful', I wouldn't have agreed with him, but I was sure he would've made me think that I should have. Was I really ungrateful though? Is rejecting his proposal of an actual new home in exchange for loyalty a definite ungrateful attitude? I didn't want to care about what he said, but apart of me felt like I should have. Did I want to be ungrateful and uncaring towards a much more experienced man and his opinions? Surely he cared a little if he was offering them and much more to me. I didn't think he had though, because deep down, I knew just as well as he that Mr. Snatcher had the upper hand. He wasn't the one in a cage tearing up over being stuck in a place he didn't want to be, yet he was also the man standing between the monsters and their plans to apparently destroy this town until it was nothing but rubble. If I'd known these words at the time, I'd have described him as heroic, if a little horrid, impressive, yet insane, daring and diabolical. And it was the adjectives 'heroic', 'impressive', and 'daring' that made me truly think about what he was asking for. The protector of this city, as frightening as he was, knew much better than I, as he offered me the life many orphans like me wanted. This much was now true. Boxtrolls are monsters, a great man can't lack anything he needs, and six year old girls need what he was giving me because it's not good for kids to be alone all the time. At least I already had these things despite my imprisonment; a bed, food, even a washroom. And the most convenient part was that the man offering it all was the influential Troll Man. I hated to admit it, but his opinion really did matter. ... Hours rolled on by like snails on concrete, and I didn't sleep a single wink. I couldn't remember the last time I'd been so silent and sleepless. Even as morning dawned, the sun producing an orange glow through the window, I tried to sleep, but my dreams never came and my eyes never stayed closed. I could hear his footsteps clacking up the steps and down the hallway. I knew he wouldn't come for me. It hadn't even been 12 hours yet. Yawning from outside my door (whether it was intentional or not, I surely doubted it), his steps faded as he walked towards his own room. I figured he was off to retire for now, not that I'm surprised or anything. Thankfully my room and his were separated by a considerable distance so I didn't hear much of what he could have been doing. But still the time ticked away, and I felt my eyes grow tired, but I still couldn't fall away into the subconscious. I had to hear nothing else for several hours except for the occasional bird's chirp and the snippets of summer bugs outside. I couldn't wait to get out of this cage. Mr. Snatcher wouldn't come in to see me for another few hours, and already I knew what I needed to say, and as I've always done, it would be the truth. ... It was about 7:40 in the evening, a similar yellow-orange glow radiated my room, and though my eyes were droopy and tired from a lack of sleep, they stayed locked on my front door. Anytime now he'll be coming through and I will have my response for him. Amidst my weariness, my heart pumped like a drum at what he might say and do. It seems that no matter what dilemma I'm in with this man, my body ultimately flips over and out at whatever possibilities there may be as an outcome. What's the best that could happen with the mindset that I shall be stuck here no matter how he reacts? He'd forgive me, treat me kindly from now on, and agree that me in a cage is also an outrageous idea and throw away the blasted box. And what of the worst? He'll refuse what I had to say, hurt me, and let me whither away to nothing but a pitiful, bony beast sitting in this cell for the rest of my days. As I laid there on the floor of the cell, I wrapped my arms around my pained stomach and could practically feel the bags under my eyes. My eyes turned misty at the idea of going any longer than I had to without food. With any luck, my day would end with a nap and a trip downstairs to the cabinets. Though I had no mirror, I felt hideous...parents don't like hideous kids. \"I wonder what it'll be like when he does get that White Hat...what if...what if he finds a better child...smarter, prettier than me...\" \"...will Mr. Snatcher kill me?\" Clack, clack, clack... I couldn't dwell on that for very long. Clacks and clicks caught me quickly. I sat up straight and tall and took a deep breath while my bedroom door was unlocked and pushed open, and in he came. After locking my door, not that I even had to think of why, he waltzed over to me, his steps wide and theatrical. He took off his red hat and held it behind him. \"Good evening.\" I swallowed a lump in my throat. \"Evening, sir.\" \"Hope you've had an exciting day,\" he said with a chuckle. I tried to smile but not much came of it. \"It was hard to.\" \"Yes, well...\" He started again, but this time he leaned over and looked at me square in the eye. \"It seems that someone is in need of sleep. Poor thing, so tired and upset. I certainly hope you've used your time to your advantage. I'd be more than happy to let you sleep right over there,\" he gestured over to my bed. \"As long as, of course, another condition is met.\" I nodded my head. \"I-I'd like to stay with you, sir.\" \"Oh really?\" \"Yes.\" He rose back up to full height with hands behind his back. \"You accept my generous offer?\" He gestured towards our surroundings. \"You'll allow me to provide these humble accommodations for you in exchange for your loyalty and respect?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I certainly hope you are being truthful, Miss Pepper.\" \"I am.\" He smiled his usual gentlemanly smile, plucked his ring of keys out of his coat, and leaned over. My eyes traveled with his long cold hand towards the lock of the door. He took my cheek and made me look at him. \"Marvelous...and another thing: don't move a muscle until I instruct you to do so.\" I froze but heard him unlock my cage door and open it. He snapped his fingers and my head immediately shot up to meet him. \"I hope you understand that from now on, if I ask something of you, I expect it to be done.\" \"I do.\" \"And you shall be good, my dear?\" \"I'll be a very good girl.\" \"Good. Now...\" He'd risen back up and beckoned me. I shakily stood up and marveled at the open pathway. He let me out and I had never been more ecstatic in my life. My tears were proof that I was not expecting this sudden jolt of joy, rather than fear. I willingly looked at him in the eyes and ran towards him. Wrapping my arms around his legs, I rested my head upon them with a grin. He had backed away a couple steps, with an annoyed grunt under his breath. I almost didn't care then. I looked up at him to say this, yet all I could see was his round gut, but I thought little of it, because I knew he was there and listening. He was letting me out and I suddenly felt so much relief, this man I was so afraid of had given me a home, and any worries I may have had about the people in my life and their thoughts of me were momentarily forgotten. He plucked me from his legs and held me in his hands. \"M-Mr. Snatcher, can I ask you a question?\" \"Hmm fair enough, what is it?\" \"Umm...it-it's j-just...when you get your White Hat...or-or if you find another child...a better one...are you, will you...kill me?\" The silence was unbearable. I nibbled my bottom lip as he hummed in though. He curved a mischievous eyebrow at me, before smirking. It quickly turned into actual chuckling, which soon formed into genuine laughter. The more restless my nerves became, the more my eyes widened. He cupped my face with his frigid hand. \"Don't be ridiculous, my dear. I couldn't possibly do away with you. You're still so very young, and in need of guidance. I, in turn, would prefer as much support as I can acquire. Unfortunately, without a proper man to assist your needs, who would possibly want anything to do with you? Or any orphan for that matter? You need me, Pepper.\" I turned my head down, and stared at my hands. He tilted my chin, so that I may look at him. \"I...guess so,\" I replied weakly. \"And luckily-\" he continued, gesturing to himself. \"...I am a fair man. I have something you need and you're a misguided little thing with something I need. It's simple logic, my child.\" \"But, sir, do you need me ?\" I asked. \"Would I keep you here if I didn't? And you'll surely have everything you've ever wanted, in return.\" My lips were sealed for a minute. His humming made me think faster than usual. \"You promise?\" \"I promise.\" \"Mr. Snatcher, I'll do whatever you ask.\" \"And I shall be holding you to that promise, little mouse.\" My emotions welled up within me and without warning I embraced him once again with my cheek, now pale again from my lack of slaps, resting on his vest. While I felt quite peculiar putting my head there and feeling myself give way to sleep, I could sense some reluctance in him; I only see now that my presence was still so very foreign to a man as rough and gruff as him. He cleared his throat, took me by my underarm region and lowered me onto my bed. \"Now off to sleep with you. We shall talk more when I return,\" he'd cleared his throat as he said this. \"Yes, sir,\" I only replied. I sat in bed and pulled the sheets up to my lap as he straightened his necktie uneasily. I smiled at him as sincerely as possible, but he was occupied with adjusting his appearance, pushing strands of hair behind his side-burned ear, and sweeping his coat of any dust with his hands. And then he noticed that I was still looking at him. Though he was frowning at himself almost neutrally, he grinned again when he focused on me. He kissed my hand (I still felt those chills from last time), put his hat on his head and backed away dramatically, and in a tone that combined sincerity with a hint of creepiness, he made his exit. \"Goodnight, little mouse,\" he said as he shut my door and locked it.[Chapter 8] Free Pepper Chapter 7 I found myself outside at the entrance to a strange town. To its left was a tall tree decorated in pink flowers, matching perfectly with the beautiful blue sky above me, and it all reminded me of springtime. I neared the city, but before I could go in and look around, I tripped over what I assumed was a branch, and fell, but I couldn't feel any pain. I landed on my knees, and though they became dirty, it all still felt like nothing to me. As I sat there and simply stared (not really at anything), a shadowed engulfed me, and I turned around, only to find him, Mr. Snatcher beckoning me as he came nearer centimeter by centimeter. \"Pepper, it's time to go.\" \"I...I don't know if I should go with you.\" To where, I didn't know, but his large foreboding frame over me convinced me that I had no choice but to get up and follow. He took my arm and led me away from the brand new town. The farther we went, the tighter his grip became. \"M-M-Mr. Snatcher, you're hurting me...\" In a moment I didn't expect, my hand snapped off. ... My body involuntarily shot up, my hair and sweat falling over my face. I grabbed my wrist from which my hand fell, and thank God, it was still there. For the longest time, I stared at my wrists as I laid there in my bed. Eventually, I took a look all around me, breathing heavily. All I could see was darkness, with the faint gleam of the moon from my window. The gray sheets and curtains made the room look dreary and horror novel-esque. Perhaps I should ask him if he could take me to a furniture decor store in hopes of redecorating, I wondered. I figured there had to be at least one in Cheesebridge. I rubbed my eyes and laid back down on the bed, and I tried to relax. Who knew when the sun would be out again? And for that matter, when the sun returns, so will Mr. Snatcher, and when he comes back, I could only imagine what what we might talk about the next time we see each other. Maybe, I thought, it won't be so scary. After all, it was just a dream. All I had to do is remind myself of this. \"It's just a dream, Pepper.\" ... Knock, knock, knock... \"Miss? Miss Pepper?\" A kind little voice stirred me back into reality again. I couldn't recall anymore bad dreams I had, but as my eyes fluttered open, I leaned up and turned my head towards the sound; my front door. \"Excuse me, Miss Pepper?\" \"Who is it?\" I asked. \"It's Mr. Pickles, Miss. I'm one of Mr. Snatcher's employees.\" Mr. Pickles...was that the beanpole? Or the giant? \"Did you have a good night, Miss?\" he asked in that same gentle tone. \"I guess so, but I'm still in bed. You can come in if you'd like.\" \"Are you sure? Are you modest?\" \"Modest?\" \"Are you wearing clothing, I mean.\" \"Oh...yes.\" My door opened and revealed the tall, thin Red Hat with the soft face. Looking at him up close, I was surprised to find how truly differently he looked from Mr. Snatcher. Mr. Pickles may have been tall like him, but his head was smaller and appeared like an upside down cone. His eyes were a rich brown in contrast to Snatcher's cloudy gray ones. His nose was small and round like mine unlike the latter's large, pointed one. He seemed nice enough, and made me secretly wished that his appearance would match his personality. \"Hello,\" I said with a weak smile. He returned it, and I knew right then and there that his was genuine. \"Good morning,\" he replied, tipping his hat, and offering his hand. When I took it, I was amazed at its warmth, unlike Snatcher's cold ones. \"I'm not in trouble, am I?\" I asked as we shook hands. \"Oh no, I don't think so. Mr. Snatcher didn't sound as if you were. He would like to see you though. He's asked that you wash up and meet him downstairs. He gave me his keys to unlock the door for you so you can come. There should be something for you to wear in the closet.\" \"Alright, thank you.\" He smiled and left me there very soon after. I took back what I'd said about Cheesebridge the night before. There were two good things about this town now; my new friends and Mr. Pickles I wasn't quite sure how patient Mr. Snatcher was, so I wasted no time hopping out of bed, drawing my bath, and picking something new to wear. I found a gray pair of trousers and a white button down to wear, and much like the clothes I slept in, they were a little big on me. Pulling a couple of toiletry items I'd brought with me from London and even found on my travels from my bag, I washed up from head to toe, and to be perfectly frank, it felt good being nice and clean again after a whole day of confinement. Bringing that little cell to my mind made my stomach back flip and my lips frown. \"Maybe if I behave really nicely, I won't ever get stuck there again,\" I said to myself. \"But what can I do? Except be good, I guess...but what else would he like though?\" It suddenly hit me that I wasn't quite sure how long I was up there. It felt like thirty minutes or so, and as a result, I stopped my thought process, readjusted my clothing, and opened my door. Each breath I took was deep and every ten seconds or so. A look of aggravation creased onto my face, and I hated it so much; not as much as I hated that man beforehand, but the hate was still evident. I figured it was just over how nervous I felt. Should I have been too surprised though? I honestly don't think so. After all, I was the one imprisoned last night. I shook my head. I couldn't think of that at the time. I had to keep walking. I approached the railing at the end of the hallway, and found a cage hanging from a chain with a shaking box inside and four men sitting at the table downstairs. Mr. Snatcher sat in the Boss Chair and while the other three men sat around him in the plainer looking ones. Mr. Pickles was the first to see me, and sit up. The other three noticed his reaction and turned around accordingly. For a moment, I very quickly noticed a grouchy look on Mr. Snatcher's face, but it quickly turned supposedly nice again with a clearing of his throat. \"Good morning!\" he said in a surprisingly chipper manner. He stood up from his chair, readjusted his necktie, and approached the foot of the steps. As he neared them, I supposed that was as good a time as any to respond to him. \"Good morning, sir.\" \"I hope you slept well.\" \"I did. Thank you.\" Coming down the steps, I practically flinched as he grasped my hand in his cold one. He didn't seem to respond, but the smile on his face tells me now that even if he had noticed, he wouldn't have cared. Mr. Snatcher, you're hurting me. My eyes widened but I shook my head to clear it,; whether he noticed that, I couldn't tell. \"I'm not in trouble,\" I thought. \"I'm not in trouble.\" \"Gentlemen!\" he cried. My head turned up to his face as he positioned myself in front of him, his freezing hands keeping hold of my shoulders. After six years of living around girls and women, standing before not one, not two, not even three, but four real men made me feel...odd. Memories of sharing a bedroom, going to St. Paul's on Sundays, and being teased by some of those girls in my orphanage's front stoop, all under the supervision of Miss Andrews and her staff, flooded back. I could barely comprehend what it would be like waking up to find four of them in this gigantic building every morning. I glanced up at Mr. Snatcher; Miss Andrews was firm but fair. This man was just...firm. \"This is the young lady I've told you all about; Miss Pepper of London, England! She'll be using the spare room upstairs as I've explained before. Mr. Trout, pull up a chair for her, will you?\" \"Of course, Boss,\" the giant replied as he pushed his chair back to get up and pick a new one from the corner. From far away, this particular fellow seemed tough and hard to beat in a fight, with brawny arms, bulky hands, plus a damaged ear and crooked nose that looked pointed and broken. But from up close, his eyes seemed just as well meaning as Mr. Pickles'. Of course, if there had been one thing I'd learned those first two days, it was the importance of instincts, but I was only a kid then. Mr. Snatcher directed Mr. Trout's new chair right next to his own and offered me to sit down. I looked from side to side and all I could think about was how awkward I felt being surrounded by all four of them. \"My dear, you've met Mr. Gristle and Mr. Pickles,\" Snatcher directed. I nodded at Mr. Pickles, which he returned. \"It's a pleasure, Miss,\" he said, tipping his hat again. \"Hello,\" I replied. When I turned to nod at Mr. Gristle, all he did was stare at me with those wide light blue eyes. Much like Mr. Snatcher, he was intimidating, but in his own...'off' way. \"And you're Mr. Trout?\" I asked the giant. He tipped his bowler hat. \"Yes, Miss, good morning.\" \"Good morning.\" Mr. Snatcher put his hand on my head. \"Charming. Simply charming.\" At least he was happy. I turned and smiled modestly with my eyes to my lap. \"Miss Pepper, my men are the best in their line of work. Battling monsters from sunset and sunrise is no easy task; always the risk of an attack, you see. Therefore, should any of us need anything of you, I know you'll be happy to listen and do whatever we ask, of course? Come whenever we call you?\" I looked confusedly at him. \"Should they ask anything of me? Come when they call?\" I thought, but I pushed that thought out of my mind for now. \"Stay in his good graces, Pepper, good graces.\" All four men just stared at me, and my heart began to beat faster than normal. \"Yes, I will.\" My gaze traveled to Mr. Pickles, who currently stared at Mr. Trout, and I could tell by their eyes that they were concerned. \"Umm, Miss, you're from London?\" Mr. Pickles asked. \"Yes, sir,\" I replied with a smile. Both men seemed appreciative. \"Is it nice there?\" Mr. Trout's low voice asked. Not as low as Mr. Snatcher's, this man's voice didn't make me anxious, unlike the former's. \"Some parts of it are.\" \"QUEEN!\" I was startled at Mr. Gristle's outburst. I glanced at the other three men, curious for guidance. \"Hush, hush, Mr. Gristle. Let the lady finish,\" Mr. Snatcher replied. I exhaled in relief once the imp settled down. \"Th-thank you, sir. You don't really see her that much unless you're family or work for her at the palace. Regular people like me mostly see her at one of those special public events,\" I smiled at the three of them, except Mr. Gristle. He looked like he was studying me, and all I could feel was this awkward pang in my gut. \"What part of it are you from?\" Mr. Pickles asked. \"Right by the docks of the Thames,\" I replied. \"Do you see sailors everyday?\" he continued. \"Lots of times a week,\" I smiled. \"Now, men,\" Mr. Snatcher interjected sporadically right after clearing his throat. \"Miss Pepper and I have a great deal to discuss, so for now, you are dismissed for the morning. I shall take care of the monster for today.\" He waved his hand dismissively. \"I shall see you all in a few hours. Go on now.\" Mr. Trout subtly shrugged at Mr. Pickles, and they both stood up from the chairs first. Mr. Gristle kept staring at me, but eventually he too rose up from his chair and walked away with them. Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles glanced back at me. I shyly waved at them. Mr. Trout nodded courteously and Mr. Pickles only smiled, and just like the one from before, I believed in it. \"Glad to be done with that foolish chatter,\" Mr. Snatcher drawled once they all left. I frowned at him. \"They seem quite nice, sir,\" I almost whispered, as I watched them closed the door behind them, all the while crouching in my seat. \"Hmm...they're hopeless, but at least they're dependable.\" He placed a long thin hand on one of my tiny ones. I turned back to face him. \"Now my dear girl,\" he leaned forward in his chair and looked at me directly in the eye. \"I would love to discuss with you the details in your time here with us, so if you would be so kind...\" He snapped his fingers and pointed to my chair. I looked at it, grasped my seat, and sat flat down in it. \"Alright,\" I replied, nodding. \"And this is how I'm going to see you every time you sit at this table, I'm sure,\" he swiped some hair away from my face, and though my eyes blinked, I kept my head still. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Good, now, I'm not going to lie and say that this shall be easy for you all the time. I'm not a very patient man and I'm not easily pleased.\" I bit my lip from the inside as I heard that. \"But I am a man of my word. I shall hold up to my end of our agreement if you hold up to your own. Surely you agree?\" \"Yes I do, sir.\" \"Very nice.\" He sat back up in his chair.\"My dear, what do you know of the history of Cheesebridge? Probably not very much since you haven't been here for very long.\" \"I know a little, sir. Bryan told me a little about it.\" \"And who is this 'Bryan'?\" \"Oh, he's one of my new friends from two days ago. I think he told me that it all started with a cheese making business, and then the town grew out of it.\" \"Hmm...your little friend has merely summarized it. Come,\" he pushed his chair back and stood up. \"Walk with me.\" As he walked by, he brushed my shoulder with my hand. I stood up, pushed in my chair, and followed. \"What else is there, Mr. Snatcher?\" I asked. \"I'm so glad you asked,\" he replied with a grin. \"Cheesebridge came from humble beginnings. Two centuries ago, a couple of families, one of them very special I must say, left your very own town and found the pastures right outside on their quest for some elbow room. The two families established their new homes here, and...worked together...\" his smile turned into a scowl. We were currently standing by the stove, to which he practically gave it a deathly look. I felt a great deal of comfort knowing that it was directed to that instead of me. \"M-M-Mr. Snatcher?\" His eyes swerved towards me and I backed away just a little. He grinned at me. \"Where are my manners?\" he casually asked. \"Follow me please.\" He walked past me again and pulled out a pan and a bag of oats. \"I might as well show you around most of this place anyway.\" I watched him fix a pan of porridge using the stove and some coal I saw inside it. Watching him light up a match was a little nerve-racking but I remained silent and simply watched him. \"Now where was I?\" he said stirring the mixture on top of the stove. \"Two families working together, sir.\" \"Ahh, yes, now, the special family in particular had found the cattle in the fields perfect for producing dairy goods, and decided to form an agreement with the others. The first family would manage finances, for they were quite detailed and intellectual in business, and the second family managed animal treatment and dairy production. Using their assets, they managed to sell milk and especially cheese, our most popular product. With time, more settlers came to work at their slowly growing business. Unfortunately, though the first family worked harder than anyone else for their village, the second family gained more notoriety for their social skills...'social skills'...they flapped their jaws far more than they worked and suddenly, they're now rumored to become the first Mayor? Pathetic...eventually both families parted ways, allowing that first, special family to find a new, far more convenient way to serve the town faithfully; pest extermination. They worked harder and stronger than anyone, hiring honorable men, Snatcher sons and daughters marrying those from notable fathers,\" he glanced down at me, making me blink. \"...and nothing came of it. Over that first hundred years, as that other family...well, the bloody lot further grew with influence, not that they deserved it. They soon made friends with other wealthier families immigrating from London, and other towns by that point. One family, by the name Broderick, had wanted to try their hand at the cheese business, and those 'influential' rats built them up and what happened to the special family? The ones with the real cheese business from the start? They were overshadowed, forgotten. Now here we are two hundred years later, and they're not even mentioned in our history books?!\" He slammed a fist down on the counter. I hurriedly back away with my hands to my chest. The look in his eyes were slits, dark and threatening. I glanced over my shoulder, hoping that somehow someone would be there to put some distance between me and him. There was no one. He took a breath and brushed some loose hair strands behind his ear. \"As those undeserving families increased, the deserving family decreased. Sad...isn't it?\" He finished preparing the porridge, poured some into a bowl, and gave it to me so I may sit back down in my proper chair. \"And do you know who that special family was, my child?\" \"No, sir,\" I nervously replied. He chuckled. \"You haven't guess?\" I shook my head. \"My family, the Snatcher Clan; the first family in Cheesebridge, and the undeserving blokes, the other first family here, the Portley-Rinds. My ancestor, Aloysius Snatcher, knew how to deal with those who slacked and fell behind. On the other hand, our Mayor's, Pemberton Portley-Rind, only cared for attention. They always have. Now, with their sad excuses for power and connections, they've allowed their youngest male member, that Lord Portley-Rind, become the mayor of this poor town. Him? Mayor? And everyone insists on continuing to vote for him in each election. And once he became a White Hat for having his position, he appoints his own little friends to become so as well, including that weasel Broderick, whose father took my father's cheese business, becoming the wealthiest in this town. It all makes me sick! Think of it, my dear. A pompous thing like him sheltered from birth by his snobby, treacherous family ruling this town thinking he's won it? He was a brat from birth and that little girl of his, 'Winifred' he calls her, will be no different.\" \"Winifred...\" \"But...do you even know her?\" I asked shyly. He scowled at me. \"I don't have to know her! The Portley-Rinds are a disappointing bunch, regardless of what role they play within that family. Even as a boy, I could see the Portley-Rinds for what they are. I knew the tales of my ancestors from my father...ahh I miss those days...you should've seen me. Lean as a horse, I was,\" he continued lightly hitting his fist to his chest. \"But that's not the point. Once I have my White Hat, I know I shall one day take his place, and give myself the respect that I, as a Snatcher deserve!\" \"You want to be Mayor, sir?\" I asked, a scared feeling emerging within me. He grinned and I only felt worse. \"It shall come after I receive my White Hat. All Snatcher men should strive for the greatness Aloysius Snatcher had tasted so many years ago; my father and myself are no different.\" His arms were wide and dramatic and his eyes looked to the side, as if viewing the future. \"If they don't, what use are they?\" \"I-I see...\" I felt queasy at so much information being poured into me like the hot cereal in my bowl. I was almost too nervous to speak, but the silence likely would've been far worse. \"Mr. Snatcher, sir, if you are going to be this great White Hat man, then...what will I be?\" He lowered his arms, his grin now appearing calm and reassuring, but I wasn't too sure about that. \"You,\" he resumed. \"How lucky are you, my dear?! Once I become the most respected man in this town, you shall become its most respected lady; the fortunate favorite of an esteemed gentlemen! By the time I achieve my proper place...\" he took my cheek. \"...you'll be what you've wanted to be and more; a fine lady worthy of belonging in a gentleman's company, educated in womanly pursuits. You will walk, talk, behave, even eat like a Cheesebridgian noble. I'll teach it all to you, my dear.\" \"Really?\" \"Why, of course! You no longer have to worry about making difficult decisions. I shall take care of everything, and your obedience is all I'll need from you.\" \"I know, sir.\" For the first time, since I first came to this factory, he patted my head. I'd never felt more awkward in my life. \"But I'm repeating myself! Now finish your breakfast, and don't take too long.\" Thankfully I didn't have too many mouthfuls left, so I finished those at a moderate pace and pushed my bowl away when I was finished. \"Wash it, if you pleassssse,\" he drawled. I had to use hot water which reddened my hands and caused slight discomfort, but I glanced over my shoulders and decided that I wouldn't dare disagree. \"When you're done, I would very much like for you to return to your room for the time being,\" he instructed. \"How come? Am I in trouble?\" I worriedly asked. \"Oh, no, no, dear.\" He beckoned me over and I stood before him, and all I could think about was the day before. I dreaded the very thought of having to see this everyday... forever; though I couldn't dwell on that. I had to think about what he wanted at this very day \"You see that little box over there?\" he pointed towards the little boxtroll hiding inside its mean of protection. It had been sitting there silently this whole time and I was quite surprised. \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"I must put that filthy little boxtroll in its proper place. Unfortunately, you are far too young to see the 'extermination' process. I certainly don't want to injure your weak, timid little heart at what I do to those pitiless creatures.\" \"Weak and timid, Mr. Snatcher?\" \"Sadly, yes, you're far too frail and delicate; clearly not meant for such uneasy matters. You'd faint the moment the troll sees you with those glowing, predatory eyes.\" \"I-I'd try not to.\" \"Little mouse...I won't say it again,\" his tone was low, as he snapped his fingers and pointed towards the stairs as he stepped towards me. I bowed my head in shame, while tapping my pointer fingers, fearing the worst. \"I'm sorry, sir.\" He leaned back. I could hear him lean back in his chair and cross his legs. \"You're forgiven...now, off with you.\" He tapped my legs with one of his heeled shoes. \"Th-thank you,\" I replied shakily as I sporadically sprinted off. I ran up the stairs as fast as I could, shut myself into my room, and scurried underneath my bed sheets, crying and deathly afraid. Mr. Snatcher, you're hurting me.[Chapter 9] Free Pepper Chapter 8 \"Have a safe night, sir.\" I had wiped my eyes of my tears a little while ago so that I could come back downstairs and see the Red Hats off, by Mr. Snatcher's request. The two of us sat down for supper again, and I didn't really say much. I mostly just let him talk about how many trolls he thought he might catch. According to him, just one troll caught made a night on the town a good night. He rambled on until we walked to the entrance and found Mr. Gristle, Mr. Pickles, and Mr. Trout gathering in the front of the building. While Mr. Trout filled the truck with fuel and start the truck and take their places, Mr. Snatcher and I just waited at the door. Mr. Pickles slipped past us to pour a pot of tea for Mr. Snatcher's teacup and saucer at his place on the vehicle. \"I'm sure we shall. We will be quite busy tonight, but that's nothing unusual, so be a dear, and clear off the table, will you?\" He didn't really look at me, as he was too busy fastening his jacket and straightening his crooked red hat. \"Oh, of course,\" I replied looking back at the table. He patted my head and like last time, it felt awfully awkward. \"I'll be looking forward to seeing you tomorrow morning at sunrise. There should be a clock in your room, so please use it to get up in the morning.\" \"Yes, sir.\" I stared at him leave as he locked the door behind him. Just to make sure, I followed him the best way I knew how. I found a nearby window and watched him climb up into his chair on top. With Mr. Trout in the driver's seat, Mr. Snatcher plopped into his chair on top, took his usual pot of tea and poured some of it into his cup. The engine started and soon enough, off they went into the night. \"Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge: the Curfew is among us! Hurry into your homes, lest you become victims yourselves!\" That day's supper was simple: a small bowl of beef stew for me and a large one for him. I tried to reach the sink, but I was far too short, so I had a thought to push one of the chairs from the table towards the it to effectively wash the bowls. Approaching the table, I stared at the lovely Boss Chair. I looked left, then right. He wasn't around; no one was around, so extended an arm. My heart almost skipped a beat at the feeling of such a seat. There was little wonder why he liked such a chair. Its texture was smooth, yet rigid from the designs, and the cushions were soft and left a hand shaped imprint when I pressed one of mine into it. I took the legs and pushed it towards the sink, not really thinking much of it. Brushing my legs and feet of any dust, I sat on my knees on the Boss Chair and washed the bowls and spoons. After brushing the table of fallen food and running a sponge up and down the round surface, I stepped back and took a look at the entire area. Everything looked clean and alright; at least it was how I'd found it before Mr. Snatcher had asked Mr. Pickles to show me how to make it, while he and Mr. Gristle sat at the table and spoke, and from the former's gestures, it was probably about me again. I yawned. It had been such an odd day, but then again I shouldn't have been too surprised. This was my first official day of being in the care of a much older man who always looked as though he could rip me to pieces, if I made too dreadful a mistake. Perfect... Remembering that I'd taken a bath earlier, I changed into a long men's night shirt I'd found inside one of the drawers of the bed table, as well as the clock Mr. Snatcher spoke of. Thankfully all the girls at my orphanage knew how to set these, for we too had to be up and awake each morning; none of this 'sleeping in' nonsense. I set it for 6 AM just to be completely sure. The sun wouldn't be quite out at this time, so surely I'd have a little time to get up, brush my hair, and find something else to wear. I slid into the sheets and shuddered at the lack of heat. I laid there for awhile, probably longer than I should have. Mr. Snatcher filled my head like water into a cup. But then again, this was becoming common. I could've cried, but those tears had fallen and were long over with. My mind and body felt far too overwhelmed for me to do anything else. The Portley-Rinds and the Snatchers: the first families, working together, but not for long. I guess Bryan had never heard that part. But then again, who better to tell it than the man it all personally affects. Had my friends ever lost a someone they had known for so long, only to feel left behind by those same people? Had they ever been robbed of something they'd worked so hard for? To add fuel to the fire, had it been done by someone they thought of as a neighbor, if nothing else? My eyes grew heavy, so any answers I could've tried to give myself never came. My breaths were short towards the table and the Boss Chair. Though the entire factory's lights were on, the windows were a deep blue from the sun rising to brighten the darkened world outside. I was still in my night shirt, and my hair was in a mess of tangles. I nibbled my lip at the sky's dark hues growing lighter within seconds. \"If Mr. Snatcher finds me like this, who knows what he'll think!\" I gasped. \"He'll think I'm disrespecting him and lock me up for a hundred years!\" I spun around furiously, my eyes pulsating and searching for the stairs. The moment I saw them made me sprint up those steps like a bat out of hell. Each step made my heart pump and my brow sweat from the pressure of climbing up each one. I couldn't let him find me under dressed, but there was no not meeting him at the front door at sunrise like he asked either. I'll just brush my hair a little, slip something on and that'll be it. The top stair was within eye sight and a flicker of excitement turned on within me. I can make it! The hallway right by me revealed a certain shape that stopped me: Mr. Snatcher's leg. Stepping onto the floor of the stairwell, he appeared before me and I couldn't move a single muscle. There he was looking down at me with the sickest grin I'd ever seen. I couldn't even say a word to him, because I knew I was done for. He walked down and with each step, a look of horror creased onto my face and my hands were raised in defense. But that didn't stop him. He took my wrist and I closed my eyes tightly. All around me, I could feel the bars and flat metallic surface, banging my head, arms, and legs. ... My eyes opened again, and I was confined only by blankets and my pillow again. I searched all around me and sighed in relief. I groggily sat up and looked at my clock. I had about five hours to go. \"Grr...\" I put the clock back on the table and hid myself inside my sheets in a huff. \"Hmpf!...stupid clock...\" RING! RING! RING! \"I'm up! I'm up! Don't kill me!\" I shot up like a bullet out of a gun. The blackness around me was dark blue once again, so I flipped over my sheets and stared out the window. If the sky looked deep blue, then the sun would be here soon enough, and I'll need to be downstairs. I pulled out light gray shirt and trousers, brushed my hair, freshened up my face, and dressed up. Even after brushing my hair I still felt a little messy no thanks to my unruly hair. \"Maybe if I'm extra good, he'll let me get some hair ties.\" But for now, my ill-kept hair and boys' clothing was as good as it was going to get. I made my bed up quickly, hurried down the hallways, and flew down the stairs, my hands promptly readjusting my appearance towards any flaw I found, even the smallest ones. Hurrying to the kitchen area, I gasped! The Boss Chair was still by the sink, and thankfully it still looked as clean as it had been when Mr. Snatcher left. Shuddering loudly, I scurried to the chair and pushed it as hard as I could back to its original place. \"Pepper!\" \"Oh no, he's home.\" I bit my lip at the stress welling up within me. I swiped the dust off and took a deep breath, only to cough repeatedly at the dust in my throat. \"Good Lord, child, are you alright?\" I turned around and nervously stood straight and tall. Even as my head turned light and dizzy, I still walked up to him and smiled as sincerely as possible. \"Welcome home, sir!\" I replied among the coughs. Mr. Snatcher met me with an unimpressed frown and an even more hunched over frame. His clacking footsteps were long and sinister, and I could practically feel it in me that something was dreadfully wrong. I warily walked over and stood before him as his stone gray eyes frightened me the more I looked at them. \"Mr. Snatcher, what's the matter?\" I looked at his hand; the one with the three rings. I tried to take it, scared as I was, but he held it up and away from me. \"Were you touching my chair?\" he pointed to it, with a curved eyebrow. \"I-I-I was dusting it for you. F-F-For when you got back. I-I'm sure you're tired.\" \"Hmm...\" Giving me a snobby look, he took my shoulder after a few seconds of staring, and pushed me away. I promptly stepped back and watched him open a couple of cabinets, pull out a wine glass and bottle (the latter I was never quite sure about in the case of what it actually was), pour some of the drink into the glass, and sit in his chair. \"H-H-How many trolls did you catch, sir?\" His look turned neutral while drinking from his glass, but it was a sort of neutral that made me cautious and stay in my very spot. \"Pepper...,\" chills ran down my spine. \"Do you you see any boxes?\" My eyes searched. \"No, sir.\" \"Do you see any trolls?\" I put my own back against the wall as he took another sip. \"No, sir.\" His eyes were like poison; deadly and painful to bear. \"Come forward,\" he drawled. I swallowed a lump in my throat and did as I was told. Standing next to him in his chair, I looked down. \"M-M-Mister...\" \"Shh. I'm not finished.\" My lips closed. \"Pepper, darling, do you see a smile on my face?\" He was still neutral. \"No, sir, I-\" \"BECAUSE I DIDN'T CATCH ANY, YOU FOOL!\" Coming to his feet, his hand forcefully made contact with my chest, sending me flying to the floor. Landing on my back, I laid there flat on the floor and pulled myself away from him. He stood over me, glaring with a look that would easily kill if it could. Mr. Snatcher's attacking hand remained in the air, at his chest's level. I took deep breaths and remained silent. I kept my eyes wide, hoping and praying they wouldn't moisten. \"Well, get up.\" I snapped out of my trance at his words and rushed to my feet. \"I'm sorry, sir. I was just...well...\" I looked away in shame and rubbed my wet face. \"You ask such ridiculous questions, and you're far too emotional. In time, I shall fix you.\" His ominous face slowly followed me as I leaned backward a little more. \"And above all, you touch something of mine that isn't yours. Did I ask you to dust my chair?\" My lip trembled and my stomach felt nauseous. \"No, b-but, I-\" \"Why?\" his hardened tone asked. \"I-I-I...\" I sat on my knees and planted my hands onto the floor, my head terribly low. \"I used it last night to reach the sink so's I could wash the dishes like you asked me to!\" I sniffled my red nose. \"You win, Mr. Snatcher. I'm sorry,\" I replied solemnly. I shut my eyes tightly, covering my face in shame. I didn't even have to ask what he was about to do. How could I not know? He was going to drag me up the steps, lock me away, and never let me see the light of day again. Mr. Snatcher held his head back, pointed at me, and laughed heartily instead. I rose my head to him confusedly. He was laughing at me. Why? \"Kid, you've got a heart of glass!\" \"...huh?...\" \"You do one little thing and you must think that I'll destroy you should I find out.\" \"Umm...oh, well, I...\" \"Oh my, you silly girl.\" He approached me, and took my hand. \"Up with you now,\" he said calmly. I shakily stood up and shook at one of his frigid hands, taking my face, and tilting it up for me to meet him. \"I do love it when I win, but even I'm willing to admit I did have a disappointing night, but your humorous behavior has lifted my spirits. I don't mind if you dust my chair. In fact, a little cleaning might keep you busy, but if you're not sure if you have permission to touch something, you can just ask me.\" \"Oh...\" I said. \"Yes...\" he mimicked. I smiled only a little when he did, but I looked away regretfully. \"A heart of glass?\" ... \"Have a restful day, sir.\" \"And don't forget to see us off tonight.\" \"I won't forget.\" Standing on one of the plainer looking chairs, I'd started washing Mr. Snatcher's wine glass. Wiping it clean with a cloth, I set it aside and yawned. I smiled innocently as his clacking footsteps receded upward. Reaching for an overhead cupboard, I placed the glass back where he'd found it, and dried the counter of water and anything else I could find. I turned my head to look at the table, knowing that there was a piece of paper Mr. Snatcher had left there; a list he'd made for me. After putting the cloth away, I took the list, pulled out an apple from a nearby cupboard, and looked at the page. The hand writing was a little twisty, but with narrowed eyes, I managed well enough. 1. Tidy up your room. 2. Launder your clothing. Launder? As in laundry? Washing clothes? Surely that was what he met. I tiptoed up the steps so as not to wake up Mr. Snatcher and looked about my room. It wasn't too bad, for all I had to clean up was my bathroom counter and my used clothes on its floor. So I turned on the water, put all my clothes inside, and used the bar of soap to scrub my clothes, and I certainly hoped that I was doing it all correctly. \"Mr. Pickles, how do you do laundry?\" Several hours later, I came downstairs to greet Mr. Pickles, Mr. Trout, and Mr. Gristle. While Mr. Trout had gone down to the basement as he was holding a mason jar, and Mr. Pickles and myself sat at the table, Mr. Gristle had stopped in a corner, falling silent. \"Laundry, Miss?\" Mr. Pickles asked. \"Mr. Snatcher asked me to...how did he put it...'launder' my clothes. I'm not sure if I did it right.\" Mr. Pickles hummed in thought. \"How'd you do it?\" \"I remembered seeing some of the ladies at my old home washing clothes in a washtub, and scrubbing their clothes with hot water and soap, so I used my bar of soap and tub upstairs to do mine,\" I explained gesturing up the stairs. \"Oh, in that case, may I show you something then? We've got a few things that'll make washing clothes a little easier,\" Mr. Pickles stood up and offered a hand and a kind smile, so I took it and walked with him to a closet I had never thought to open before. It stood close by the kitchen, in between that and the corner of the front door where the door stood. He opened the closet, revealing a collection of cleaning supplies: a broom, mop and bucket, sponges, a washboard, a round tin washtub, and a green bottle Mr. Pickles pulled out for me. \"We'll do our laundry here at the factory every few days or so during our down time. This here is the clothing soap. You fill the washtub with water, apply soap and rub the clothes against the washboard.\" \"Yeah, I remember. But I've already washed my clothes.\" \"You can always use these next time.\" \"Sure!\" I smiled at him, but sporadically chuckled. I almost couldn't believe it myself; a smile appeared on my face (willingly!). In this intimidating factory, I felt actual...joy. I suddenly noticed something Mr. Snatcher would've called 'peculiar': Mr. Gristle hovering over a rectangular tank I hadn't really gone over to look at before. The beanpole noticed that I was staring, and he too looked on. \"Yech!\" I cried towards the sickly green box. I whipped my head away in revulsion. \"What's the matter, Miss?\" Mr. Pickles asked in his usual calm way. \"What is he doing?\" I asked, pointing at Mr. Gristle with my tongue out in disgust. \"Mr. Gristle's just feeding the leeches.\" \"Oh...wait, what?\" I asked. \"You see that big old glass box, right?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"The three of us keep that tank of leeches. We take turns feeding them, but Mr. Gristle seems to like it more than we do, so when he asks if he can take a turn, we always let him.\" \"Blech! Why leeches? Why not something nicer like a goldfish?\" I asked with a sour look. \"Well...\" his voice trailed off. \"Goldfish are nice, but I'm afraid the leeches are all we can afford. It's... for the better.\" \"How come?\" Mr. Pickles fell silent, tapping his fingers. \"It's rather hard to explain.\" His gaze turn somber and tragic, as if a truly heartbreaking feeling had just overtaken him. \"Why? Are the leeches sick?\" He hummed once more as he shook his head, this time a little anxious himself, but he wouldn't look away from me. He took a deep long breath. \"No, It's not that, it's...oh, it's no use. You'll see it all eventually.\" \"Ooh...\" My face lit up at the possibility of a secret. \"See what? Tell me! Tell me!\" Leaning forward, I gave him a grin, apparently goofy enough to make Mr. Pickles smile. Even as a child, I was never one to ignore a secret. \"Well, the fact is, Miss, the leeches keep Mr. Snatcher from swelling up.\" \"Swelling up? What's that?\" \"Well, he...gets bigger.\" \"Bigger?\" \"Yes. If he eats cheese or drinks milk, his face and hands, and sometimes his legs could swell up. The leeches, suck up the...pus in the skin, so that it's easier for him to stomach.\" \"Well, his is really round and puffy.\" Mr. Pickles grinned and chuckled. \"No, no, I mean 'put up with it'.\" \"Oh...\" I nodded in understanding. \"What's pus?\" \"Uhh...\" he said as his head grew misty with sweat beads. \"It's this liquid that grows inside the skin whenever you get a sore on your body. The Boss gets them whenever he eats cheese. We call them 'Cheese Fits',\" he explained with evident discomfort. \"UGH! That's gross!\" \"You're right! Let's talk about other things,\" he replied as we both laughed. But then we trailed off... \"He makes me nervous.\" \"He makes everyone nervous, Miss.\" ... \"And what is this for?\" I couldn't help but smile the rest of my day after my talk with Mr. Pickles. To this day, I never thought that a conversation about laundry and leeches would make me feel better but it did. Even after Mr. Pickles, Mr. Gristle, and Mr. Trout went outside as the evening came and Mr. Snatcher came, I only felt a little afraid...but when I saw him coming down the steps the way he always did, I took a breath, cleared my mind, rushed to him, and wrapped my arms around his legs. \"Today's been really good, sir! I did all the stuff on the list, like you told me. And I talked to Mr. Pickles!\" \"Mr. Pickles, you say?\" he glanced at the front door. \"Yes!\" I exclaimed. He plucked me off his legs and put me to the side so he could walk on. \"What did you two talk about? Nothing too personal I hope.\" \"Laundry and cheese and leeches!\" \"...I beg your pardon?\" he chuckled nervously. \"Laundry, cheeses, and leeches, Mr. Snatcher...are you alright? Your eyes are twitchy.\" Making it up to the counter at this point, I could see him stare aggravatingly at the counter. \"Relax, Pepper,\" I thought to myself. \"Did Mr. Pickles say anything about the leeches?\" he asked in a bothered tone, almost a little scared. \"They cure your Cheese Fits, sir.\" \"Bah! Cheese Fits?!\" he scoffed. \"Pepper, dear, I do NOT receive these Cheese Fits you speak of! I use cheese to remind myself of my purpose on this Earth! To demonstrate the respect and power I deserve for my family's services to this town, inevitably leading up to the acquirement of a White Hat: a true connoisseur of cheeses.\" \"Y-yes of course...\" \"But I've spoken enough of that already. Now, Pepper, no more of this 'Cheese Fits' talk. It's not very becoming, and a waste of time.\" \"Y-yeah, yeah, sure,\" I swiped my hair behind my ear. \"You seem a little uneasy,\" he replied. I involuntarily twitched. \"W-w-well, I've been doing a little thinking.\" He raised an eyebrow. \"That must have hurt.\" \"I don't want to-...hurt?\" \"Continue, please.\" I bit the inside of my lip. \"Umm...I-I don't want to be made out of glass.\" \"Glass, my dear?\" \"Yeah, I mean...you said I have a heart of glass. And...\" I squared my shoulders and he nodded in reply. \"I don't like it, Mr. Snatcher. Not at all!\" \"Hmm, I see.\" \"Nope! I...cry alot, and I don't want to. I don't feel 'special' yet.\" \"Aah, you've mentioned that before.\" \"Mmh-hmm...and...\" my confidence deflated a little. \"I'll be here for a loooong time, right?\" He smiled. Playing with my fingers, I fell silent. \"Pepper, I don't have all night.\" My head jerked up. \"Y-Y-yes, uh, I-I-I want to go to a store, and get that dress and shoes I told you about. I-I think I'll feel better.\" He hummed, turned around, and strutted for the front door. \"You're right, my child, for once. You will be better, once you look better.\" He glanced at my long, deep red hair. \"...and do something about that red hair...\" he muttered. \"What's wrong with it, Mr. Snatcher?\" I asked. \"...nothing at all,\" was all he said as he eyed it and tightened his necktie. \"And that is why we are here. Yes, we shall begin by bettering yourself in appearance; intellect and propriety will come with time. You will begin by drying your needless tears,\" He opened the door, and turned to face me one last time. \"The rest of your appearance must wait until tomorrow. Pleasant dreams, my dear.\" \"Good-\" He closed and locked it. \"...night.\"[Chapter 10] Free Pepper Chapter 9 I woke up the following morning believing that something just wasn't right. I had been in bed sleeping until something cold tapped my shoulder. My eyes fluttered open and as I rubbed them, I yawned and pushed my sheets away. I sat with my back turned to the front door and stretched my limbs. \"Ahem.\" I froze. I slowly turned around, 'eeked!', and hid under my covers. Mr. Snatcher turned on my lamp, pinched my blankets, and lifted them, revealing my face. \"M-m-my alarm hasn't gone off.\" He glanced at the clock and watched it tick for a second or two. \"Did you forget to set it?\" he replied, peeling my bed sheets. \"It looks like it,\" I muttered. He took my clock, showed me the time, and put it in my drawer. It was about 9:30 in the morning. \"It was for the better. I had an errand to run so I let you sleep in. Thoughtful of me, ain't it?\" I sighed in relief, smiled, and nodded a little. I watched him until he closed my drawer, fully aware that he'd seen my bag full of money and cheese. I widened my eyes when I noticed some stubble on his face. He eventually took a glance at me. \"What? No good morning? No thank you?\" \"Oh! Good morning! Thank you for letting me sleep in.\" He placed his hand on my head and smiled. \"And good morning to you...I wanted to wake you myself. I've got a couple of things for you.\" He turned around, and I wouldn't dare move. He handed me a list firstly. \"You may look at this on your own time.\" Secondly, he gave me a long unwrapped rectangular box; a boxtroll wouldn't have worn it because it was in two pieces, the lid and the actual container, all bound by string. If anything, it looked like the kind that would hold clothing, and of that, I had a realization. \"Is this for me?\" I asked pointing to myself. \"Open it.\" My eyes widened and my jaw dropped. I took the string into my fingers and tried to undo the knot. The string was thin but incredibly tight. Using my thumbs to play with it, I heard the light tapping of Mr. Snatcher's fingers, the man giving an impatient groan soon enough before he snatched the box and cut the string himself. \"Here.\" He gave it back to me and watched me open it and I stared in silence at what I found. A blood red dress with mid-length sleeves surprised me, despite my assumption that it really was clothing. I didn't know these terms at the time, but if I did, I'd have described it as one with a jewel shaped neckline, a knee length skirt and a buttoned down back. The elbow and wrists of the sleeves, and the small subtle ruffle near the base of the skirt was a lighter, rosy red color, and the collar, low waistline, and thin, stitched in petticoat were white. The latter was slightly longer than the skirt but only by a centimeter or two, making its white fabric a little visible to the naked eye. With the dress came a pair of gray stockings, a pair of white embroidery to tighten them with, a circular blood red colored hat, short and flat like a straw hat but clearly made of felt, with that same rosy red color wrapped around the lower half of the crown in the form of a ribbon tied in a bow on the back of the hat, and finally, a blood red hair bow and black buckled shoes. I rose to my knees and wrapped my arms around his own arm and hummed with a smile. \"Thank you, sir! They're all beautiful! I can't wait to wear them!\" The arm I took bent in repulsion and I could tell from the curls of his fingers. His free hand took my shoulder and jerked himself from me, allowing strands of hair to fall from his face. \"Of course, Pepper darling,\" he replied in an almost disgusted demeanor. I could tell by the way he took my shoulders and lightly pushed me back down onto the bed. I smiled at him as he took my clothing, pulled out a hanger from my closet and hung it over the rail. \"The Fortunate Favorite of an Esteemed Gentleman shouldn't go without at the very least something proper to wear. I recommend looking at the list first before you putting on your apparel; don't want it getting messy. Now, if you'll excuse me: I'm off to retire for the morning, but...\" He spun around rather gracefully making my shift in my spot. \"It would be simply splendid if you accompanied me on a little outing today. Say, 4 o'clock?\" He asked, taking my hand. \"An outing? You mean...we're going somewhere...other than here?\" He chuckled at me, making me seal my lips shut in a twinge of fear mixed with nervousness. \"If you complete every task on the list, of course you may come. Nothing too difficult, even for you.\" I parted my lips to respond, but he yawned and turned around. \"I shall see you at 4, and please be ready by then. Dress and all.\" \"I will.\" I nodded with a smile. ... Downstairs Only! 1. Sweep the floor 2. Mop the floor 3. Dust the furniture The list didn't sound too hard. I put on an older, brown pair of trousers and men's shirt so that I wouldn't risk ruining my new clothes. I opened the closet Mr. Pickles had shown me the day before and I mostly just stared at them. I never really did a great deal of cleaning back in London. I mostly just ran around the city looking for things to do, but I did know a few tips about the subject. I knew that sweeping came before mopping. Taking the broom and dustpan into my hands I stopped and looked at the floor first and foremost, and my heart sank. \"...shoot...\" I thought. I'd completely forgotten the fact that the downstairs of the factory was obviously the largest area in the entire building. How could I have overlooked that while reading that blasted list? \"It's alright, Pepper. You can do this,\" I said to myself. I started at the corner by the closet and brushed the broom to the floor. Sweeping from left to right like a pencil on paper, I kept an eye on each little cluster of dust I found, grouping it all together into two or three piles. From corner to corner, and centimeter to centimeter, the broom searched and gathered, through the kitchen area, below the stair case, around the levers that controls the hanging cages, and anything else I could find. Amidst the sneezing and wheezing from all the dust, I couldn't stop; not until everything looked perfect. Two hours of sweeping, another two of mopping, and thankfully dusting only took one hour (at least that's how it turned out no thanks to the slippery floor). After a thirty minute inspection over everything I had cleaned, I smiled and wiped the sweat from my brow. I excitedly rushed up the steps and back to my room to clean up. My stomach rumbled and gave me the idea to pull out the gouda I'd started the other day. Pulling out my bag and opening it, I'd expected to see that and the money Genevieve gave me. Thinking of her made me frown. My only friend up until I'd met Leona, Bryan, Abigail, James, and Skyla, and I wasn't sure if I'd ever see her again. My Cheesebridge friends were one thing, but Genevieve was another. Opening the bag and searching around, my stomach performed a back flip. My money was gone. All of my pound notes had completely vanished. I searched frantically for it was all I could was the gouda I put to the side. I shuddered at the complete emptiness of my bag. My gift from Genevieve had been taken. My lip quivered and I put my arm to my eyes, because I could feel them grow misty with emotion. I tried my hardest to bite them back. Besides, I figured that I didn't have much time left before I'd have to be downstairs in my brand new outfit. The gouda I'd bought beforehand still smelled and even tasted alright. The rest of that had to be my lunch as my bathtub filled up with water. I stared out the window as I nibbled my cheese; the sky was pretty cloudy for a summer day. \"I hope it doesn't rain,\" I whispered to myself. I looked up at the clouds, smiling at an image I had in my head of a group of white clouds and a group of gray clouds colliding with each other in a great big battle. Brighter clouds hitting dimmer clouds with their swords and shields in hopes of determining whether the latter would let it rain or the former would keep the sun shining. My elbow slipped from the window sill, causing to slip back into reality. I washed myself in the bathtub, making sure that I scrubbed deep. If I was going to walk around in my special dress and shoes, I might as clean myself up. Feeling fresh in a new pair of jockey shorts I found in another drawer, I pinched the dress by its shoulders and looked at it. It felt soft, making me hug it tightly. Traveling between London and Cheesebridge and I felt a little excited at finally having my very own special outfit. After tying my hair in a low ponytail, I pulled the stockings over my legs, fastening them right below my shorts (if the ladies in London could do it, surely I could), unbuttoned the dress and slipped it over me. Fitting my arms through the sleeves, I fastened every button and pulled my long hair out from under the dress. The last thing to add was my hat: my Red Hat. I shuddered from realization, but there was no use in complaining. Mr. Snatcher never did seem like the kind of man who tolerated complainers. I stood before the mirror and stared. I alternated from smiles to frowns. On one hand, I felt beautiful. \"If the girls back home could see me now,\" I thought. But forgive the repetition, but why did it have to be Archibald Snatcher? The dress fitted me pretty well and the flowing skirt made me twirl around, and I felt as if I was flying through the air, with the snobs I'd seen in both towns far below me. But in my fantasy, I could see red tinted clouds forming into a lightening storm. Whenever I would remind myself that it was him who made this possible, it was like a deadly strike that would burn me up and pull me to the ground. I couldn't stay up in the sky for very long though. I pulled my clock out of my drawer and looked at it. It was almost a quarter to four. I stared at my bedroom door and warily turned the knob. I looked out one of the windows while I waited for him downstairs. The sky was still a little overcast but I wasn't too worried about that anymore. I was far too focused on the outing ahead. I almost couldn't believe it. Mr. Snatcher and I out in the open; what will people think? Where would we go? What would we go? Clack, clack, clack If only I'd had the time to guess. I turned around at the sound of footsteps, and stood up straight and tall. \"Good afternoon, sir.\" \"And good afternoon to you as well,\" he said this in an almost bewildered tone; the kind a man might give to an exceptionally lovely woman. Within a minute of seeing him, I noticed something a little different about him. \"Why are you carrying a stick?\" I asked. Mr. Snatcher came down the stairs with one hand on the rail and a walking cane in the other. I'd seen men in London walk with them, and even then I would wonder why they would carry them if they had no obvious walking problems. The cane was long and silver, but the knob itself was shaped like triangular piece of golden cheese. \"I'll have you know, child, that this is a family heirloom. This walking cane has been in my family since the days of Aloysius Snatcher! Perfect for running errands before work.\" \"But what's it for, sir?\" He gave me an annoyed look. \"Didn't you ever see men walk about with their own canes in London?\" \"Well, yes, but I always thought they just had problems walking.\" \"Some do, but I certainly don't,\" he replied with a scoff and a hand gesture pressing lightly to his vest. \"For those esteemed few such as myself, it sets us apart from our peers; an indicator of gentlemanly behavior.\" \"Do you ever use it for work?\" His eyebrow twitched. \"Pepper, did you not hear me? I use it for errands!\" He jabbed the knob into my chest as he said that last word. \"Ow!\" \"I wouldn't dream of risking the loss of this precious item to a horde of disgusting monsters! For God's sake, girl, pay attention!\" \"...S-sorry...\" Mr. Snatcher had given me an ugly look while I rubbed my chest and swiped at my dress, making sure it was still devoid of any dust. He tapped his finger to his lip, probably thinking. \"And while you're at it, spin around,\" he said twirling his cane about. I closed my eyes and turned quickly. \"Not too fast, you daft girl. Just enough to let me look at you.\" I turned much more slowly and nibbled on my lip. \"Don't ruin this,\" I thought to myself. \"How do I look?\" I asked curiously. \"Hmm...proper,\" he bluntly stated with a grin. \"You can go anywhere now. I just knew I picked a grand look for you.\" \"Yes, thank you.\" I smiled but not at him. My head was pointing downward as I showed him my appearance. \"Alright, alright, stop turning,\" he said in an annoyed tone. \"Y-yes, of course,\" I practically jumped up straight and tall and fixed my dress just in case. He walked past me and pulled out the ring of keys. I could feel chills of excitement as he unlocked the door. I approached him but before I could say or do anything else, he spun around and put his palm to my chest. \"Don't move.\" He turned back around and turned the key in its lock. His pushed open the door and stepped out. Once his feet were planted firmly outside and he beckoned me with his finger, a little spark of excitement charged me right outside into the fresh air. The warmth of summer made me exhale a great deal of air and turn my head all around to look at the river on my right and the town on my left. The buzz of the summer bugs and light breeze on my face made me look up at the sky, hold my hat so that it wouldn't fall as I tilted my head to reach for it. I vocalized my happiness in seeing this missed picture of nature I wanted so badly to return to just the other day, completely forgetting that I wasn't alone. When the sight of the hills surrounding Cheesebridge caught my attention, I had a feeling about what I truly wanted to do. \"Wow...\" I whispered. \"Now's your chance.\" I heard myself say in my head. \"Run as fast as you can. Don't look back. If he catches you, you will never be free.\" \"You must be very excited.\" My smile quickly disappeared and I turned around to see Mr. Snatcher tucking the keys away into an inner pocket in front of a presumedly locked door. I blushed a little in embarrassment. \"I like being outside, sir. I miss it.\" Mr. Snatcher took my hand and pulled me aside so that he can bend over to straighten my hat, which had fallen crooked from all the excitement. \"Well, if you behave, you just might have another opportunity.\" \"Really?!\" I asked, with an almost uncontrollable jump. \"Yes, yes, now calm down,\" he replied grasping my shoulders tightly enough to put my back against the wall. \"I-I can be calm...\" I replied in a softer voice, blushing up. \"Are you completely under control?\" He asked seriously. I quickly nodded. Mr. Snatcher pulled out his watch and clicked it open. \"Then, we must be off.\" He took my hand, held it tightly and we both walked away into town. \"Now my dear Pepper, if you're going to behave like a civilized girl, we must establish some rules for our little outings. For one, you shall always remain by my side. You know how I feel about you running off.\" His grip tightened. \"For two, while I take your hand as we walk, you shall keep your other hand to yourself. This applies to all circumstances unless I allow it. For three, when speaking to other members of our society, you shall be pleasant and respectful, using 'sir' to men as you do with me, and 'Ma'am' or 'Miss' towards women, as I'd done with you. And please no raising of the voice or foul language. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, Mr. Snatcher,\" I replied. I unexpectedly squeaked when he took my cheek to make me look at him. \"And let's keep the details of your time with me to ourselves, shall we? Out in public is no place for discussing such personal matters. And well behaved ladies wouldn't dream of breaking any of these rules, lest they be regarded as 'pests' by certain individuals and be treated as such.\" He showed me his ring of keys, forcing me to swallow a lump in my throat, and nod. So in other words, don't walk away from Mr. Snatcher, don't touch a thing, be polite, and don't talk about being taken and caged. \"Yes, sir.\" His demeanor made me feel as though these tasks were impossible. One little mistake and it could be back to the cage, because apparently that's where uncivilized pests belonged. As Curd's Way turned into Milk Street, I could feel butterflies flutter inside my stomach. I hadn't been in town very long by this point, and I could feel a growing sense of self-consciousness at the idea of people seeing me. At first, I couldn't wait to show people how pretty I looked in the clothes I'd always wanted, but now that some would surely see, the idea of Mr. Snatcher walking beside me and keeping a tight hand on me made me blush. What would these snobby folks think? It was hard to tell. Walking up Milk Street made me heave up and down from a lack of experience treading a hill as steep of Cheesebridge. London was flat and smelled like fish. This town was elevated and smelled like cheese. Opposites, if I'd ever seen them. But I wouldn't dare say a word about it. Mr. Snatcher didn't seem as though he even wanted to talk. He appeared to be in a happy enough mood when we came across a couple walking by. A middle class looking woman with her arm linked around a man was given a 'good afternoon' by Mr. Snatcher. The couple, who looked kindly enough, almost immediately noticed me. I waved to them and though they waved back, they looked confuse, if not a little shocked; not that I blamed them or anything His cane made a 'tapping' sound as it touched the ground with each step he took. With his fancy, family owned accessory, his rings, tall hat, and velvet coat topped with a fur collar, I'd never seen a more impressive looking man, and I felt very intimidated. I looked up at him as we walked and analyzed his fallen strands of hair. If those had been pulled back as well and his stubble removed, he would've looked even more impressive, but then there was that air about him; the one I'd always felt about him and consumed me with dread. Dignified and gentlemanly on top but downright scary underneath it all. He looked down at me, making me throw my head down, my self conscious blush still on my cheeks. \"It's not polite to stare,\" he drawled. \"I know. I'm sorry.\" He sighed almost in an almost pitiful 'you silly girl' sort of way. \"You say that word so often.\" \"What word, sir?\" \"'Sorry'. 'I'm sorry' this. 'I'm sorry' that. It's become annoying and repetitive. Sometimes a 'yes, sir' or 'no, sir' is all that needs to be said.\" \"Oh, I see. I'm so-oh! I mean, yes, sir.\" He rolled his eyes. \"How do I know when to say 'sorry'?\" \"I shall make it evident for you. You still have a lot to learn about good behavior.\" \"I'm trying as hard as I can, sir.\" \"Well, don't try too hard. I don't want to hear complaining over a headache...\" He looked back forward, at which I looked down, sporting a glare at him. \"I saw that.\" I went wide eyed and slapped my hands to my face, covering it in embarrassment. I heard him chuckle but I dared not react to it. \"...Ahh, here we are!\" Before I could answer my own question, I looked up to find that we'd arrived at a shop. At the front door was stood a long cylinder spiraling red, white, and blue. \"A barber shop?\" I asked him. \"I had an appointment today, and I certainly wasn't about to leave you at the factory alone. Come home to find you wandering about my factory poking your nose into my personal business? Goodness no.\" I gave her a slightly defiant looked as he turned his head away from him and followed him inside. If he insulted me one more time... \"...oh wait. I can't do anything, can I?\" \"Pepper?\" A different voice made my stomach do a backflip. Mr. Snatcher had approached a man who was inside the shop, the barber I assumed, and I turned around almost sporadically. The voice sounded high pitch, yet male, as if coming from a very young boy. And lo and behold, upon turning, who did I find but the handsome redhead James Goudman, standing on the opposite side of the street all by himself, looking more surprised than anything else? I hurried to the entrance of the barber shop, beaming at him and embracing the good kind of butterflies inside me because Mr. Snatcher never said I couldn't wave. Standing on the tips of my toes, I straightened my dress, hat, and stockings, and waved left and right, making it big and joyful-looking on purpose. \"Pepper, what happened to you?\" I pulled down my dress in modesty as my blush turned into that of flattery. I even twirled to give him a full view of my look. He didn't seem to notice that; his face still spelled bewilderment, by I didn't care. My heart fluttered at just his presence alone. \"Where'd you get the...\" He had put his hands to his mouth to increase his volume but his hands dropped and his face turned fearful. His frightened look confused me. I wanted to ask what the matter was, but then I remembered that I couldn't raise my voice. He backed away into the shop right behind him, and though I reached out my hand, longing to say something, someone spoke for me. \"You go on home, boy. She hasn't the time to chat with you. Go on! Go!\" James ran down the sidewalk and I stared hopelessly until he vanished from view. My cheeks reddened in anger, but I couldn't let him see it. He almost crushed my wrist in his hand when he pulled me back into the barber shop. Though his face looked pleasant, his tightening grip made me wince in pain. \"I'm awfully sorry about that, Mr. Crabs. When she's not being shy, she's being quite absent minded,\" Mr. Snatcher explained to a tall man with a large nose and ears. This man with his larger facial features was somewhere in the middle between Mr. Pickles and Mr. Snatcher; Not as lean as the former, but certainly nowhere near as thick as the latter. \"Oh, so she is yours?\" Unfortunately. \"Why yes, she is! I found the poor thing living inside a barrel of all places the other night. All alone, no place to go, hungry, tired, vulnerable to those box pests: she was a sad little sight. As most are aware, it would've been against my ethics to leave such an innocent child at the mercy of monsters,\" he explained grandly, the knob of his cane pointing to his torso to emphasize. \"...so I felt it was my personal responsibility to take her in, and raise her properly; help her become someone of value. All it took were some negotiations. Mr. Crabs, meet Miss Pepper Snatcher.\" \"I see. Well, that is just wonderful, sir!\" I pondered over this man's strangely cheerful nature. \"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Snatcher!\" The barber replied offering his hand. I reluctantly took it, and he kissed it, leaving me a little surprised. \"Hello, Mr. Crabs sir, \" I replied courteously. It was a little hard to, no thanks to the shaking at my knees. \"So you're a family man now, sir? You've never seemed like the type,\" Mr. Crabs asked as they walked down the hallway together, with me close behind. \"Beforehand, no. But these are desperate times for certain individuals, sir,\" Mr. Snatcher replied placing his hand on the top of my head, and glancing at me. I smiled nervously but I doubted that he believed it. \"Desperate measures are called for, it seems. Besides, the young lady makes a wonderful companion.\" \"I do?\" I asked aloud. He gave me a convincing and I nodded. \"I-I do! Thank you, Mr. Snatcher.\" Mr. Crabs looked back at me, causing Mr. Snatcher to touch me with the end tip of his cane. \"Oh, you're still on last name terms, Miss?\" The three of us eventually made it to a spacious room where there sat a barber's chair with a stand holding a tray of what I assumed were barber supplies. The room had a vast window and a spare set of chairs in front of it. I opened my mouth to say something. \"Oh-ho, you must forgive her, my friend,\" Mr. Snatcher interjected. My mouth closed in disappointment. \"The dear child is still readjusting to her new life as a fortunate young lady. Precious girl had no last name before we met. But I soon remedied that.\" Before sitting down, he took my shoulder, grabbing my attention and showed me his cane again. \"Hold onto it for me while I shave, will you?\" I reached for it, but he held it back. \"And try not to break it,\" he said with a hint of a threat. \"Oh no, sir.\" He took my hands and positioned them on the stick itself, turned me around, and subtly pushed me away, as he took his place in the chair. \"You're welcomed to have a seat in the chairs, Miss Snatcher. This might be awhile.\" \"Thank you.\" Mr. Snatcher waved me away, causing Mr. Crabs to turn and begin work. \"The usual, sir?\" \"Yes, clean shaven, but only shorten the sides. I've grown fond of them but keep them for too long and I'll start to look ill kept.\" \"Of course, sir. Understandable.\" As I sat in the chair, I watched Mr. Crabs mix a shaving brush into a tiny container, creating a lather inside it. After he started brushing the lather onto Mr. Snatcher's face, I rested my head on the palm of my hand and sighed, while my eyes traveled to the wooden floor. \"Sit up straight and tall, Pepper. Don't be a slob,\" he said. My head lifted as he spoke with that usual judgmental look on his face. Sitting up straight, I focused my attention back on the clouds. \"Umm, may I turn the chair around and look outside?\" \"I suppose so,\" he replied, keeping still while Mr. Crabs shaved his face. One might think that watching a barber shave the face of Mr. Snatcher himself of all people would at least be a little interesting, but to me, it felt like a void of boredom except for the sounds of a blade running up and down the man's face. There was no music, no color in the room, and no conversation starters for me. It was mostly just Mr. Crabs saying 'yes' and 'of course' to Mr. Snatcher's ramblings about work and the people he didn't like. I turned my head towards the window with his cane still in my hands, and now resting on my lap. I looked down and watched some of the townsfolk pass by. A variety of people ranging in ages and assumedly classes based on their appearances alone made the town seem much more alive, and I smiled at the idea of being one of them. I recollected a thought I'd had the other day about leaving Cheesebridge and coming back a grown woman, unrecognizable by the Red Hats. Grown into grace and beauty, I imagined being greeted in gentlemanly and ladylike ways by all who met me. I would reintroduce myself as someone different than who I was at that moment. Not 'Pepper Snatcher' but a new Pepper, a stunning Pepper who could make friends with anyone I wanted to; picnics in the daytime and parties in the nighttime (if the Boxtrolls are gone by then of course). I sighed at my fantasy. But then I frowned because that's what it was: a fantasy. The reality of the matter was that I was Pepper Snatcher, not of my choosing but of the choosing of a man, whose demeaning comments were making me feel worse and worse with each new word spoken. The thought of it put a scowl on my face. Just because Mr. Snatcher was an important member of this society didn't mean that he had the right to belittle me...right? I turned back to Mr. Snatcher, his face now clean and smooth, and Mr. Crabs. The latter was delicately snipping Mr. Snatcher's sideburns with a silver pair scissors, careful so as to avoid making a mistake. With a sweep of the shoulders from a brush different from the lathering tool from before, Mr. Crabs held up a mirror for Mr. Snatcher to look at his work. \"Satisfactory, sir?\" \"Hmm...as usual.\" He gave Mr. Crabs two silver coins and stood up from the chair. Brushing his shoulders and pushing his hair behind his ear with his hands, we made eye contact. \"Come, Pepper. We're leaving.\"[Chapter 11] Warning: This chapter is not for sensitive readers. Free Pepper Chapter 10 \"You look very smart, sir.\" \"Why thank you. That's exactly what I was hoping for.\" I held Mr. Snatcher's elbow as we walked away from Mr. Crabs' shop. If I wasn't about to stare at him for very long and be deemed rude, then I could at least make eye contact with him when saying this and then keep my eyes on the dark gray clouds; surely staring at them wasn't an offense. My head twitched at an unexpected rain drop. I held out the open palm of my free hand. \"I figured it'd rain.\" I kept twitching with each new drop. Even the townsfolk who stared at us scurried indoors. \"Mr. Snatcher, what do you do at night when it's rainy?\" He glanced at me like I was off my rocker. \"I work! You think the Red Hats are going to allow water deter us from our duties? I think not.\" \"You've never caught cold, sir?\" \"Bah, colds! I'm not bothered by such things. luckily, my men are required to be extremely adaptable. I wouldn't have hired them if I didn't think they could be.\" \"Adaptable?\" \"To adjust.\" \"Oh.\" He shook his elbow away from my hand, causing me to flinch. \"You on the other hand...\" He lifted the side of his jacket closest to me, and pulled me towards him. \"Who am I to let a lady be rained on?\" My head, hat, and shoulder bumped into the side of his belly, and I awkwardly took my hat off so it wouldn't poke him. Holding it to my chest, I looked up to find me lingering in his coat. With the top of my head and shoulders were surrounded by deep red and one or two inner pockets, I felt sick to my stomach just for being this close to a man; one who really liked strong scented cologne. His legs touched my shoulders as we walked, making me flinch once more. \"You seem to jump at a moment's notice,\" he observed from outside. \"I can't help it sometimes, sir...ever since I got here, I've felt nervous.\" \"Do I make you nervous, little mouse?\" I almost gasped. \"W-w-well, I...uh...\" \"Yes?\" he asked slyly, with a hand from the outside to my head. We both stopped at the entrance of the factory and I watched him put his other hand on my side of his jacket to pull out the keys from one of the pockets. But even then I couldn't give an answer. \"Mmh-hmm,\" he said. I watched him unlock the front door. He tapped my head, giving me the cue to walk inside. I took a breath of much fresher air and exhaled in relief. I stopped at a random spot in the factory and brushed my sweaty forehead. \"You've no reason to be nervous, Pepper.\" I turned my head to over my shoulder and watched him lock the door. \"Unless, of course, you do something I just can't agree with. But you won't, I trust.\" I was apprehensive, but I kept my smile. \"No.\" \"Wonderful!\" he exclaimed. \"Now, have a seat. We have something to discuss.\" \"We do that alot, sir. Talk about things?\" \"Too true,\" he laughed. He strutted towards the table and I followed him, but before he sat down, he walked over to a counter, and pulled out that tall bottle and a glass. A little unsure, I just stood there by the table and watched. He growled a little at the cork that wouldn't come out until he finally yanked it out. I mostly studied the image the bottle had: a variety of fruit grouped together in a cluster. He took his seat back at the table and subtly shook the glass. \"Pepper, come here.\" My eyes widened and I looked left and right. \"Come on then,\" he continued, giving me a look of warning. I reluctantly walked up to him. \"Yes?\" I asked. My shoulders rose as he took my sides. \"Umm, sir, I-\" He put a thin finger to my lips and shushed me. He lifted me, and the two of us sat there together, me on his lap, feeling a little worried. But his gaze never left me, and an image of me in my box kept me still; trembling, of course, but other than that, I did nothing. \"You'll have to forgive me for Mr. Crab's careful observation. I was so determined to make sure you behaved well, that I had forgotten one little detail,\" he suddenly said with a hand to my back. The idea to bite him flew out of my mind the moment he said that word. \"Huh?\" I asked surprisingly while he took a sip. \"I hadn't considered the 'last name' terms you have had with me and my subordinates. As much as I hate to admit it, that dimwitted fool has a point. If I am to be your caretaker, maybe it is time you to begin addressing me as such, both in and out of doors.\" \"Father?\" \"You might as well, my dear. Those who live in this town will expect you to do so, and besides, haven't you always wanted one?\" I pressed my finger to my cheek in thought. \"Well...it's a little hard to say.\" \"How?\" he asked, as if offended. \"From what you've said, it seems that acquiring the proper attire and a parent would solve many of your problems. You have both now, so you ought to enjoy it, as a grateful child should.\" I scratched my head in contemplation. \"...I'm trying to be grateful. I've heard about kids not getting to do alot because nobody ever adopted them.\" \"Well, then...\" he took my hat and delicately placed it on the table. My gaze followed it, but he tilted my head back to him. \"...aren't you special?\" I put a hand to my chest. \"Yes, you,\" he replied. His grin was awful slick, but I couldn't deny it or defy it. \"Thank you...\" I rubbed my neck timorously. \"I thought you didn't like me.\" Mr. Snatcher laughed. \"'Didn't like you'?! Ridiculous!\" \"It is?\" \"Of course it is!\" \"But what about all those times you were...mean?\" \"Mean?!\" He snarled and leaned forward like a shot cannonball, making me back away towards his knees, looking to the floor. He threw his head and laughed once more as he brought me back a little towards him, making my heartbeat quicken at what else he might say or do. Whether or not I should've been thankful or not was a mystery to me. \"I kid, my dear,\" he chuckled. He took his hat off, and placed it beside my own. \"In all seriousness, these 'mean' episodes you speak of are misunderstood. I have lectured you yes, but I do so to help you understand your place. We all have one. And yours is?\" \"With you?\" I asked innocently. He patted my head. \"Ah, you're learning. I'm very fond of you, Pepper. The way you try to be extra good just to please me. You listen and behave accordingly. And as long as you continue to do so, you will remain 'special'.\" I kept my smile, and I promise that it was genuine. \"You really think I'm special?\" He leaned forward, resting on his armrest in one hand, and his other hand now on my arm. \"You were today, Pepper. And with my guidance and protection, you shall be again.\" \"Does this mean I can go outside more often?\" I asked him with a hopeful, excited look on my face. \"I know I've said it before, but I really, REALLY miss it!\" \"As long as you're with me. I don't like you being all alone out there. But never you fear; I shall always know where you are.\" My stomach tingled and my shoulders shrugged, yet I kept smiling. \"Yeah...I hope you didn't mind me using your last name all those times.\" He waved his hand dismissively. \"It is only natural to show respect to your superiors; that shall never end. Show respect and the same shall be returned,\" he explained, putting his finger to my chest. \"Do you understand, my lovely mouse?\" My eyes opened a little wider in disbelief. My shoulders relaxed and my heartbeat decreased. All these promises, then 'special', and now the repeated 'lovely'. I nibbled my lip but it wasn't just in fear. I put my fist to my mouth in shock and disbelief. Mr. Snatcher seemed so untrustworthy, but I didn't really care anymore about that at the time. I leaned forward and wrapped my arms around his thick neck, with my cheek on his chest. He tilted his head back and his hands grasped their armrests, and I couldn't sense a smile in return, yet I never questioned it. \"Yes, Daddy.\" I watched Father put on his red hat like a king crowning himself. \"I shall see you in the morning,\" he said, making his usual grand exit. \"Have a safe night,\" I replied, waving to him. I watched them all leave on their truck as always through a window, and very quickly hurried back to the table once they'd disappeared from sight. After washing all the messy dishes from supper, I stared at Father's special chair and I smiled. He may be horrid at times, not to mention all I have now, but it delighted me to know that I'd finally earned his good graces (in his own intimidating way). As I stared at his chair, I swiped my finger across the wooden surface and observed its dust. I knew he liked it when I did things for him, like dusting his chair. Did he ever say I had to use a feather duster all the time? \"Not really...\" I thought. I swiped more of the surface with my hand, making me get closer and closer, until without warning, I took a seat inside the chair itself. The seat was wide in comparison to my short, thin legs, but I could certainly see why he liked sitting here. Next to the plain rectangular chairs, the Boss Chair felt powerful. Touching my feet to its legs and sliding my hands on the armrests, I felt like a Royal. 'Princess Pepper' sounded simply magical to me. But for that moment, considering the conversation we'd had earlier, maybe 'Pepper Snatcher' wasn't so bad after all. The Fortunate Favorite of an Esteemed Gentleman was as close to 'Princess' as I was going to get, and I really ought to enjoy it. I coughed a little and my eyes traveled about looking for something to drink, and I immediately thought of the bottle he chose from sometimes. I had wondered why grownups liked drinking something that looked more like grape juice than anything else. I stood up, pulled a plain chair from the table, and reached a high cabinet. I eyed the picture of fruit on the bottle, remembering that I'd seen it before. I pulled out the cork the way my Father had, and took a whiff. It smelled like juice. I took a cup from the cabinet and poured some. Despite my reluctance, I took a sip, and my stomach flipped over. \"It is grape juice!\" I took the bottle and cup and brought it to the table. \"Now what would Mr. Archibald Snatcher do?\" I asked myself. I leaned back in relaxation, crossed my legs, and hummed. Looking at the pretend rings on my finger, I took another sip. \"I say, old chaps...,\" I modified my voice to make it sound low and rumbling. \"...those boxed pests are doomed! Once they're gone, Cheesebridge will find I'm all it shall need!\" I gulped some more of the strange drink, the new flavor delighting me. \"I am a great man.\" I pushed my hair behind my ear and gestured to myself with outstretched arms. \"Certainly not like that Portley-Rind! I don't have to know his bloody wife or kid! I will take his title as the Most Respected Man...\" I giggled with mirth. \"...in the world! Wow this is strong.\" I finished my cup and poured some more. \"Now, when I destroy those little monsters,\" I sipped a little more. \"...I-I will have my White Hat...And effey-one'll bow and curtsssy to me like a Lord...A time honored tradisshhion-a...\" I could feel my stomach churn, so I placed my cup and the bottle to the side and blinked. I locked eyes with the stove and laundry line, and from what I could see, they both looked as if they were slowly turning, like a person in bed struggling to sleep. I finished my second glass of grape juice, and put my side of my head on the table. Here, I could feel a warm sensation in my cheeks, while the hanging cages a few feet away from me spun around. I groaned a little at the sickly feeling inside me, so I pushed the chair away and sickly slithered off. Wrapping my arms around my midsection, my legs grew weak and soon enough, I dropped to the floor. I laid on my front side and felt my head spin. \"I-I-I...don't feel so go-\" ... My vision cleared back up after an unknown amount of time. I found blotches of varying grays that soon formed into the face of a man. The man's face was shaped like an upside down cone to me, which soon enough revealed a worried face that sighed profusely with relief. Though my eyes were half open, I found a ring of light surrounding the fellow's face. \"M-M-Mr...Pickles?\" \"Oh, thank God.\" He dabbed my forward with a moist washrag. \"Sir?...Am I in...Heaven?\" I asked, confused. \"No, Miss. You're in your bed. I'm glad you're awake. I was awful worried that we'd lost you,\" he gently replied. He leaned forward a little bit, making me lean back in uncertainty. \"Forgive me, but your eyes...\" \"What'sss wrong with 'em?\" I weakly asked. \"They're a dreadful red color, almost pink.\" I put my fist to them. \"No, no, don't touch. That'll make them worse,\" he explained. \"If you'll excuse me...\" My eyes traveled all over the room, where I found sunlight coming through the windows as Mr. Pickles stood up from my bed and hurried out my bedroom door. \"She's awake, everyone! She's alright!\" I watched him leave, and my heart sank into my stomach, which still felt terrible. I put a hand to the dampened washrag, feeling it grow warm from my heated face. I noticed that I was still wearing my dress, but my stockings were sitting on my bed table, and my buckled shoes were placed in a corner by my cage. I turned to my cheek, with my back to my door, I closed my eyes trying to return to sleep. Everything was quiet for a little while. \"Miss?\" I fluttered my eyes open at the sound Mr. Trout, who with Mr. Pickles and Mr. Gristle stood by me. I sat up in bed and felt my heart pound in my chest. \"How are you feeling this morning?\" Mr. Trout continued. \"I don't feel good...\" \"What hurts?\" \"My stomach and my head.\" Mr. Pickles put a bowl of porridge in my lap. \"Thank you...\" I muttered. I scooped up some of the hot cereal and started eating. \"Miss, do you remember anything from last night?\" Mr. Pickles asked. \"I...sat down and got thirsty. And then I got sick and fell asleep.\" \"And?\" All of us, minus Mr. Gristle, turned to my door at that word. The little imp giggled, not having to turn to know who it was. \"Good morning, Daddy,\" I greeted with a hint of fear. His three men turned back to me, evidently not expecting that title. Mr. Snatcher leaned on the doorway, looking as if nothing was wrong. \"Men, would you be so kind as to be dismissed for the morning? Pepper has to be feeling awful and must have her rest.\" Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout looked at each other cautiously. \"Are you sure, Boss?\" My Father rose his eyebrow. \"Yes, now do as you're told. And don't touch the mess downstairs,\" he replied pointing to the hallway. Mr. Gristle grumbled and left, followed by a worried looking Pickles and Trout. As soon as all three of them were out of the room, Father closed my door and locked it, and then turned all with his hands behind his back. He spun back around and took a wide step towards me while I timidly at my breakfast. \"Pepper, dear, I found the strangest thing this morning when my men and I returned from work. When we came into the factory, we smelled a horrible stench coming from our table, and what do we find, but a little girl sprawled out on the floor with a fallen glass and bottle?\" he explained in a dramatically melancholy way. \"And trickling from the poor soul's mouth was undoubtedly, some...regurgitation...\" He explained with noticeable disgust. \"And no matter what we did, we just couldn't wake the little darling up, so Mr. Trout brought her up here to rest and allow herself to wake up on her own time.\" He leaned forward put a hand to my forehead, and quivered his lip. \"But now our Sleeping Beauty is awake...a bit warm...but awake.\" He stood up straight and tall and revealed his still hiding hand, revealing an object that made me feel queasy just as I looked at it. \"Know what this is?\" He asked, his attitude neither obviously sad, concerned, angry, or otherwise. \"Grape juice, sir?\" I replied. \"Wine, my dear,\" he explained, still remaining calm. \"An alcoholic beverage for mature individuals such as myself. Certainly not for someone as young and ill composed as...\" His gaze grew cold and reprimanding. \"...little Pepper Snatcher. Whatever gave you the idea that this was little more than juice?\" He said that last word with contempt. \"Alcoholic?\" \"Hmm, I see...\" Planting the bottle on the floor, his free hand on my bed right next to me, I pulled my sheets over and up to my nose. \"...You don't know much of anything, do you? All you know seem to truly know is what I've told you; including a very important rule I gave you just two days ago, and yet you don't even seem to know how to follow them. Didn't I tell you not to touch anything of mine?\" I rubbed my neck at his horrible gaze upon me. \"I wanted to dust your ch-chair and I s-started to and-\" SLAP! His rings dug into my skin upon the back of his hand's impact with my cheek, sending my head falling and hitting one of the corners of my bed table. I fell silent, except for the deep breaths moving my torso up and down. Taking my face into his free hand, he made me look at him. His grasp was quite firm this time, but still just as cold as before. \"Don't lie to me.\" I hid my face with my arms in shame. I could feel the soreness from his hand on me, especially the places affected by the hard rings on his fingers. He let out a frustrated sound. \"You don't respect me.\" \"Yes I do!\" I cried, daring to look at him with my tear stained face. \"I-I thought it wouldn't matter 'cause you called me a 'Snatcher' yesterday! I just thought it was a nice drink only fancy people could get, so when you called me a 'Snatcher', I thought...I'd...try it.\" The more I spoke, the more foolish I sounded, so I closed my mouth and turned my head away from him in shame. \"I figured as much,\" he responded. \"Though we haven't known each other for very long, I've managed to learn a bit about you. You're a careless little thing I can't take my eyes off of for too long. What should I do, little one?\" He ran his fingers through my hair using his usual low tone of speaking. \"Must I purchase a collar for you?\" I shot my head up at his face, a mixture of pity and disappointment. I gasped when his hand took my neck. \"Should I place it around your neck and keep a short leash in my hand, so that I may walk you, train you, and have you sleep at the foot of my bed like a pet?\" \"No, no, no, sir! Please not that!\" I came to my knees, begging and pleading. \"I'll be a good girl! I won't do anything ever, ever again!\" My bent knees, as if bowing, cries for mercy, and head down, like a subject acknowledging her king, made him smile. His eyes traveled up and down while his grin at my groveling at him as if he were the Royal in question. \"Pepper,\" he resumed. \"I shan't put a collar and leash on you. You are not a beast.\" I sighed in relief. \"You are, however, a child in need of a punishment, and seeing as though you've left me no choice...\" I slowly shook my head. \"...you are a Snatcher now; therefore you shall be disciplined like one,\" his voice suggested a growing anger that grew stronger with every little centimeter he took towards me. He suddenly revealed the hand that had been hiding behind his back this whole time, and inside it was a thick brown belt and buckle. \"I am going to get through to you.\" Taking my arm with his free hand, he took my sheets off me, flipped me and my dress over, but before I could even try to block my jockey shorts from his view, my last glance of him reminded me of a crazed man ready to strike a child with a wrench. I knew any defense on my part was pointless. For the next ten minutes, there was nothing but pain. Every smack to my back, behind, and legs felt like a merciless onslaught of wasp stings. These swift, yet stinging pains in my skin made me scream and shout for mercy, all of which fell upon the deaf ears of my Father. The attacks made me hold onto the sheets for dear life, believing that if the punishment ended, something worse might happen. Each minute felt like an eternity, making me believe during the ongoing madness that it would go on until I was nothing but dust. Eventually I was flipped over, and the pain seared into the front of my legs and my bare stomach, again like multiple eternities of hurt and anguish, with the only comfort to be found was the soft textures of my pillow and sheets. My eyes stayed closed shut because I couldn't bear to look at anything. After several minutes, I couldn't feel anything, but I trembled in horror that maybe it would return. His hand delicately pulled back down my dress and sat me up in my bed. My red, puffy eyes could barely look at him as he picked up his bottle and pointed to my door. I slowly pushed myself out of bed and followed him out of my room and down the hallways and staircase. My weakened legs almost gave out several times but the gaze he would throw back at me kept me up and walking. He took me down the stairs where I detected but barely reacted to the smell of my vomit. Pushing the mop into my chest, he pointed to the mess. \"Just look what you've done, Pepper.\" He told me as I mopped up the mess with soap and water in a bucket. He sat in his chair with his feet propped up on the table. His hands held a refilled glass of the drink that got me into the mess. As his hands and cup rested atop of his stomach, he watched me like a hawk. And I did it all in silence. When the floor was to his liking, he opened up a window for me to dump the mixture of bodily fluid and water and tugged me back over to the steps. I stood before him at the bottom of the steps with my head down, overflowing with shame. \"Have we learned anything today?\" I nodded to him. \"You'll always understand your limitations, and follow my rules and respect them, won't you?\" I nodded again. He put his hand to my forehead again. \"Stay in your room until tomorrow morning and please don't come out. We may not care for colds but I'd still hate for me and my men to catch your illness\" I turned to climb up the stairs but he touched my shoulder one last time and cleared his throat. \"Yes, Father.\" The walk back to my own bed felt more like a journey. My sore and weary body clouded my head, making the world around me blur and contort. I could feel my energy levels deplete the closer I got to my room. My knees trembled as I finally reached for my door, pushed it open and entered my room. The very last of my strength was dedicated to my climbing into bed, taking off my dress, and tucking myself into bed in my shorts, because I was too weak to do anything else. I was alone for the rest of the day. No visits, no supper, no medicine or even any words, except for the thoughts in my head, before I fell asleep, over how stupid I was, risking the loss of Archibald Snatcher's favor so soon after earning it.[Chapter 12] Free Pepper Chapter 11 In the three months following the Wine Incident, I was indeed put on a short leash; metaphorically speaking, if I'm being honest. Every day felt like a never ending challenge to keep Archibald Snatcher, my Father, in a constant good mood. In doing so, I more or less picked up each rule that I should've realized my first few days there. Even though no one wrote these rules down for me, they became pretty obvious, even to \"delicate\", \"small minded\" Pepper. They were as follows: 1. Mr. Snatcher had the final word on everything. 2. No visitors allowed in the factory unless invited by Mr. Snatcher. 3. I can't touch anything that specifically belongs to Mr. Snatcher. 4. I will do whatever the Red Hats ask of me, with Mr. Snatcher as my top priority. 5. When on outings, I will be respectful and stay by Mr. Snatcher's side. 6. The Basement and Mr. Snatcher's Private Quarters are off limits unless specified. 7. I will greet the Red Hats every morning and see them off every evening. 8. I can neither talk to nor participate in the extermination of the Boxtrolls. Ever. Thankfully, Mr. Pickles, Mr. Trout, and Mr. Gristle very rarely took advantage of these rules. One of the few instances I can think of as I write this was on a day in which I was assisting Mr. Pickles in some cooking and when I told him I'd never cooked a day in my life, he asked me to read the cook book he'd been using and point out the ingredients so that I could understand the ins and outs of the recipe. I also recall a day in which Mr. Trout had asked me to pull out a book of my liking. Some of the larger words were a little hard to pronounce, so he had me repeat each sound from them to help me understand. I also remembered a day on which Mr. Gristle showed me how to clean the aquarium of leeches. With his seemingly limited vocabulary, I learned that once a week, he used a special tube he'd stick inside the water to clean it, much like that of a fishbowl. The only part I didn't really care for was the two of us bent over for about an hour, hovering over the tank while maintaining it, but all in all, it was definitely the highlight of that day. Activities with the three of them were pretty enjoyable all things considered. When my Father was either in his Private Quarters or on an outing by himself, the four of us would stay behind and play 'Charades' or card games. My favorites were always 'Go Fish' and 'Speed'. I learned very quickly that Mr. Gristle was a Master when it came to games, and as a result, he seemed to win each one. I once asked Mr. Trout why they would play, knowing that Mr. Gristle would always win. \"I believe it's just to entertain ourselves, Miss,\" he explained. \"We don't really mind who wins. It gives us something to do when we're not working.\" \"I guess that makes sense,\" I replied. \"When I was in London, I used to explore for fun. I liked that. I think everyone oughta have fun, don't you?\" \"Well, sure...I believe one way to put it is...all work and no leisure is like a paper bag flying about on a blustery day. When will the hustle and bustle finally stop?\" Mr. Trout shrugged. \"Hard to know, Miss.\" I smiled at him and shrugged too. Other times, Mr. Trout, Mr. Pickles, and/or Mr. Gristle would be sent on outings, and when they were, I would always ask my esteemed, smart, oh-so-wonderful Father if I could pretty please go with them in an effort to get out of the factory for some fresh air, he would let me go with them, as long as I followed the same 'outing' rules: don't leave them and be respectful as always. Granted, it only happened if he was feeling kind. Mr. Snatcher's outings were very different from those of his men. His errands were quite frankly the only things we did and they typically involved whatever appointments he had scheduled. It was all whatever he either needed or wanted to do; quite boring, but even I wasn't stupid enough to tell him that. When I went out with Mr. Pickles, Mr. Trout, and Mr. Gristle, there was at least a little more freedom. We usually went out to get groceries from the Market Square for the kitchen area: mostly tea bags, vegetables, beef, unmade broth, and Extra, Extra Mild Cheddar, but afterwards, if we had time, sometimes we'd look inside the retail stores and point at random items. Mr. Pickles would watch me run around a toy shop we found on Gouda Lane. Mr. Trout liked looking at the books inside a bookstore on Mozzarella Avenue and would even help me find some children's books for me to practice reading. Mr. Gristle would often point out a variety of swords and guns in a weaponry store on Provolone Place. As much as I was a little apprehensive about being there, a trip into this store with Mr. Gristle was better than being stuck in a factory with my Father anytime. I say that because whenever his men weren't around, and it was just me and him, usually one of three things would be happening. I'd either be working on some unfinished chores, trying to keep myself from dying of boredom in my room, or on a usual outing with Mr. Snatcher. I could tell that the never ending journey I spoke of was to resume whenever he would come in with his 'I didn't catch a Boxtroll' face. The moment I see it, that's my cue to just stand there, fully dressed in one of my day dresses and await for him to tell me to do something. Sometimes, he'd just write down my list of responsibilities for the day and that'd be it before he'd go upstairs. Other days, he wouldn't even let me wait. 'Pepper, bring this.' 'Pepper, do that.' And his tone was either one of two emotions: tired or infuriated, and because I kept trying to prove to him that I was indeed smart, despite how much he disagreed, I always kept myself a few steps away from him. If he had caught a Boxtroll, then while he would provide a list of things for me to do most of the time, he was always much nicer. 'Pepper, please bring this.' 'Pepper, please sit down so that I can talk to you about my successful night.' And I would always nod and acknowledge how grand he was to take on such a task. Most of those mornings ended with a pat on my head and dishes to clean, but as long as he was happy, that was what mattered. That's why one particular memory that comes to mind troubles me a little bit. One morning, I woke up at the sound of my alarm as usual and the first thing that came to mind was to hurry up even faster than usual. Because on this certain day, three months after the Wine Incident, there was one thing I had to ask him, and I hoped that he had caught a Boxtroll, because that confirmed most of the time that he would be in a good mood, and much more likely to let me speak. It was 5AM when my alarm clock woke me up, so that I could get started. It was a little hard to, but I managed to sit up, rub my eyes and slide out of bed. \"Today's the day!\" I cried. Slipping a blood red work dress, light brown pinafore, and black stockings and laced shoes, I could almost feel myself burst from excitement. \"I'm going to ask him!\" I tied up my laces and my hair as tightly as possible. Fluffing up my hair and bow on my head, I scurried down the steps in anticipation. \"Don't have much time. Don't have much time!\" Despite the fact that I couldn't touch his personal belongings, I was glad to know that I could touch food, the kitchenware and the table and chairs, minus my Father's. I pulled out three eggs and a plate on the counter, and a frying pan and placed them on the stove. I vigorously shoveled some coal into it, pushed a plain chair towards it so that I could heat it, pulled the plate toward me, and cracked the eggs. I hummed a little song to myself as I watched the eggs sizzle. My heartbeat increased at the possibility of what he might say at my request. Looking at him and talking with him was hard enough, but making him happy was a challenge in and of itself. \"I hope he says 'yes'! I hope he says 'yes'!...\" I cried as I placed the cooked eggs on the plate and placed it on the table, but then I stopped. \"No he won't...but it's worth a try...is something missing?\" I placed a paper flower I'd made the day before in a dry empty vase and placed it in the center of the table. As I stared at the table, wondering what possibly be missing, I tightened my bow and straightened my dress and sat at the table in a plain chair. That man will be coming through that door any minute now. The sudden sound of a motorcar engine could be heard from right outside the door. My heart flipped over when the sound receded and was replaced by clacking footsteps. \"Please have a Boxtroll. Please have a Boxtroll.\" The jingling of keys and the opening of the door brought me to my feet. \"Good morning! Welcome home, Father!\" This greeting was much more heart felt than usual because as he came in, he strutted in like a King approaching his throne. And he only did that when...yes! In one hand he held a trembling box, squeaking and gurgling in misfortune. I almost bursted with delight myself, but I just couldn't, so I didn't. I hurried up to him and kept my smile, which I swear was real and genuine. As he was about to walk past me, my eyes met the little shaking box, but I quickly bowed my head and took a step back. In the corner of my eye, I could sense his smile at my gesture. At times like these, I felt as though I couldn't even look at those creatures, for fear of offending him. I watched his body instead as he approached a hanging cage, unlocked it, and placed the creature inside. When I heard the clicking sound of his locking the cell, I pulled my own head up and suddenly remembered the task at hand. \"I trust your night went good, Father!\" \"'I trust your night went 'well', Pepper. 'Good' is improper.\" \"Oh...right...umm, I made you breakfast.\" I took his hand and rubbed it tenderly. \"Look!\" I directed him to the table. I showed him my flower. \"Mr. Trout showed me how to make these yesterday. Isn't it pretty?\" I asked with a smile. He pulled his hand out of mine and merely glanced at it. \"T'is only paper,\" he stated matter-of-factly. My face fell for just a moment before I cleared my throat and put the vase back on the table. \"May I fix you something to drink, sir? A glass of brandy? A sherry? Or even water perhaps?\" He barely looked at me as he sat down and glanced at what I made for him. \"Pepper, your memory baffles me. I tell you not to touch those things and yet you ask if you could prepare glasses of them?\" My stomach flipped over. \"Oh, yes, you're right! S-sorr-I-I mean you're right, of course.\" I blushed a terrible red color. \"But a glass of water I have no qualm against,\" he continued. I smiled and rushed to the cupboard to fetch a clean glass. At the time, I didn't even think to question his suspicious gaze following me. Within a minute I held out a tall glass of water for him, with extra ice just as he liked it. He warily took it and finally actually looked at me. \"Can I do anything else for you, sir?\" \"Sit down.\" I immediately fell into a plain chair. \"Yes, I can sit!\" I smiled and kicked my legs in a carefree style as he finally started eating. With the occasional sip of water, I nibbled my lip and what he could have possibly been thinking. \"Father, I-\" He held up one finger and my lips closed instantly. The next few minutes felt more like hours as he took his precious time cutting the eggs and eating them one by one. \"I hope they taste alright,\" I thought to myself. \"If they're not...\" I rubbed my neck. \"Do you like them?\" \"Awful bland and a little burned...some salt would've been nice,\" He replied. I rubbed my neck vigorously. So that was what was missing? He smiled. \"And a little pepper, Pepper.\" He chuckled a little as he poked my chest, and I kept smiling, despite my slight aggravation at his sense of humor. \"Quite conditional, as well.\" \"Huh?\" He ran his napkin across his lips and was silent for another minute or so. My gaze traveled left and right. \"You might as well tell me what you're hoping for. That ridiculous smile and this attempt to impress me is all the indication I need.\" My smile dissolved as he said this, so I squared my shoulders and took a breath. \"Nothing gets past you, Father.\" I cleared my throat. \"So...\" I placed a hand on his arm. \"Can you guess what a week from today will be?\" I asked as innocently as I could. \"Hmm, October 14th, of course. Two weeks 'til All Hallows' Eve,\" he replied once more in that matter of fact kind of tone. \"Well...\" I resumed. \"...yes, there's that. But there's one more thing!\" I leaned forward, my arms linked to his arm adoringly. \"It'll be my birthday, sir!\" I giggled amidst my announcement. I leaned back and spread my arms wide. \"I'll be seven years old!\" Despite my delightful outburst, he just seemed...unimpressed...at least for a minute before he grinned again. He put a finger to his chin in thought. \"Seven, you say? Really?\" I nodded gleefully. \"Well, I suppose that is a reason to be excited.\" I nodded my head joyfully. \"Yes, yes it is!\" I replied. I must not have noticed how close I was to him, because he soon enough took my arm himself and peeled it off of him. I quickly took a step back and inhaled a deep breath. \"Father, I'm turning seven, and I was wondering if I could, well...if you could...\" He raised an eyebrow. I suddenly felt a cold rush over me. \"...j-just...umm...\" He rolled his eyes, sighed, turned away for a minute, put his knife and fork on the plate, and stood back up. \"Pepper, Father is awfully tired. If you must ask something of me, I recommend that you quit the mumbling and just say it.\" I frowned while he gave me a frustrated look. He turned away and carried the plate and silverware to the sink. \"I want you to take me to the Toy Shop!\" His head had been pointed down as he placed the dishes in the sink, but at the sound of my outburst, he glanced straight ahead and locked eyes with me. \"...what?...\" \"I-I was just wondering since it'll be my birthday, I had hoped that maybe I could-we could-go and I could pick something out that I really like. I've tried so hard to be good like you want, and...\" Snatcher didn't seem to show much of a reaction as he looked at me and soon enough, walked back towards the table, and sat in his chair, cross legged. \"And you want me to take you?\" He asked. I approached him cautiously and nodded silently. Folding my hands as if praying and smiling sweetly, I watched him for a minute. He stroked and tapped his chin with his pointer finger and hummed. My knees began to knock at the way he'd just let me stand there with no answer, looking me up and down as if he were teasing me. I never put it past him. He smiled at me, with eyes that appeared warm, but as I'd come to learn, I could never be without doubt. \"Pepper, come here,\" he beckoned to me. I sighed and approached him a little more. \"Yes, sir?\" \"Turn around.\" With my back facing him, I softly gasped as he took the end tips of my hair into the palm of his hand and studied it. I looked over my shoulder with worry and confusion. \"Yes...\" He replied. \"Father?\" I asked smiling hopefully. He turned me back around with his hands clutching my shoulders. \"My dear, if you'll do one last little thing for me,\" he resumed, pointing to himself daintily. \"I shall spend my hard earned money on one item of your choosing.\" \"Oh, thank you, Daddy! Thank you! THANK YOU!\" I hurried to his side and hugged his neck gently. He leaned back upon impact as I rested my cheek on his chest for about a minute, not really caring about his strong cologne or his arms laying away from me, rather than returning my embrace. \"Ahem.\" My eyes opened and I looked up at him. His annoyed look made me let him go and take a step back. \"Excuse me, Sir.\" \"Hmm, that's better...\" he said. I nibbled a lip as he took his jacket and reached into one of his inner pockets. \"Let's be prompt and take care of that 'one little thing' right now.\" My nibbling lips smiled again. \"What do I need to do, sir?\" His eyes trailed back at me and he returned my smile with a crooked one of his own. \"Pepper, Father needs something from you,\" he admitted, pulling a sympathetic face. I nodded in understanding. \"It is for a little...experiment...of mine that I've had on the brain for awhile now; Even before I'd found you, and I want you to assist me.\" \"How?\" I asked. \"The first thing I need from you is your hair...\" He almost hissed, drawing out that last sentence. My smile faded. As Snatcher ran his fingers through it, I looked at my hair, and even touched it. \"My hair?\" I asked. \"Just for this one time, my dear. And then I won't bother you about it anymore,\" he replied. \"It's such a lovely red color, and...\" He turned me around again. \"...it would make me so happy. You want me to be happy, don't you?\" \"Oh, of course!\" I looked back over my shoulder one last time. \"Well then,\" he rumbled, pulling a knife out of his pocket; one I'd never seen before. I stared at it momentarily, and turned my head back around. From behind, I could hear soft 'sheering' sounds. I glanced back for just an instant. My whole insides flipped over at the very sight of his sharpening it. Once he examined the knife, nodded, and smirked approvingly, I swiftly looked away, and caught a glimpse of my long hair one last time. His clacking footsteps seemed just as, if not more, awful than before. \"I...love you, Father.\" \"I know, darling, I know...\" ... I looked like a boy. That was my first thought after it was said and done. Father had gone to his room with my hair in his hands, and gave me the day off from my usual chores. But even with my day long freedom, I couldn't look away from my bathroom mirror. My head had become nothing but a short awkward tuft of hair. I picked up a hairbrush to try to tame it and though it looked a little more organized after a few strokes, it still felt strange. The back of my neck felt a little cool and my head felt much lighter. I smiled at those feelings, so it must have been the look that bothered me. But if Father was happy, I should be happy... I turned around and, as if right on cue, I yawned as I caught sight of my bed. I sat there at the foot of it and rubbed my neck. I had a staring contest with my closet as an idea came to mind. \"Well, Pepper, girl, look at yourself...well, even more than before. What's everyone going to think? A girl with short hair?\" I asked myself as I opened my closet door. I picked out my own red hat and a nicer looking 'outing' dress and hummed. \"Bows won't be easy to wear now, huh?\" I continued. I walked inside it and pulled out a frilly red bow. I placed it on top of my head and grumbled. I wasn't about to pull one of these off. \"Not with this hair,\" I thought. But as I stepped around the closet, something happened. Tap. \"Ow!\" I looked down at what stubbed my toe, and there right below was a small leather bound book, marked 'Journal' in gold letters. As it often did, curiosity got the better of me. Coughing at the dust flying around its old looking pages, I opened it up. Strangely enough, the first page was blank, save for one little paragraph of text in the upper left corner. \"To those who write to stay sane.\" My eyes widened at a certain memory I'd almost forgotten, and it gave me an idea.[Chapter 13] Free Pepper Chapter 12 \" Dear Genevieve –\" I began to write in crude handwriting on the first page of the journal. I'm sorry we didn't talk in 3 months. Well, I found this town, Cheesebridge. It's a huge town on a big hill, south of London. I saw my new father the first night I was there, and he's really tall and fat and creepy! But he's also really important. He's got a velvet coat with a fur collar, the tallest red hat in the whole town, and someday, he's going to trade it for a White Hat, the best hat you can have here. His name is Archibald Snatcher, and he's a very important gentleman. He caught me the second night I was here, and he took me away to his house. I just had to go with him! It's a factory, but he calls it his home. He really scares me, but he made me his daughter and even gave me the new dress and buckled shoes I always wanted. I think he may have taken the money you gave me, but I don't want to say anything. He can be awful mean sometimes. I think I'll just leave it alone. He's super picky and wants me to be good and perfect. But he and his men are going to be my new family! Mr. Snatcher is the Boss, then there's Mr. Pickles, Mr. Trout, and Mr. Gristle. So here I am in my new home. It's very different than the orphanage on the Thames River. The Red Hats are a nice family. Every evening, they pile into their big motorcar and hunt boxtrolls, monsters I saw the first night I was there! They looked nice, but Father says they really stole an inventor and his son and ate them up! They added their flesh to their rivers of blood and mountains of bones! At least, that's what Father says, and he's always right. Mr. Pickles is my favorite Red Hat. He's really nice and showed me how to do laundry. I like it when he gets to take me to the market with him. We have to buy extra, extra mild cheddar, because Father and his men like to play 'Pretend White Hats', where they sit around and eat cheese, like the White Hats, who decide stuff for the town, though it's mostly cheese tasting. It never ends well, but Father loves to do it. I don't think anyone in this town knows how to use their hats right, but no one is perfect. Mr. Trout taught me how to read and write bentter. He got me a library card and takes me there when Father says I can. Sometimes, Mr. Gristle will take me to a weapons store to look at nets and guns; now, that's fun. \" I'd better go now. I know I should be happy here. What's wrong with me? \" Love, Pepper Snatcher\" I tried as hard as I could to rip the pages out of the journal as delicately as I could. Apart of me had told me to just stuff it in my drawers, but as I looked at it, I shook my head. I stepped out of my bedroom, and from the hallway, heard Snatcher snoring from his Private Quarters. Beyond my bedroom were two more doors; the door to his office, and the second was his bedroom. To go into his office was just as unthinkable as his stepping in his Private Quarters. Two secretive worlds of their own in an otherwise strange town, I could only imagine what Archibald Snatcher did in the quiet of his own sanctuaries. Snoring loudly was apparently one. I couldn't help but giggle as I tiptoed away in the opposite direction. I stared down at my papers as I reached the steps. He didn't like secrets…from me anyway. I could never keep one from him for long, if that first week had been any indication. I suddenly froze at the thought of the Strap; those terrible strings from the leather and marks from its buckle made my hands just shake. \"If he knew I was talking to someone without his say so…\" I stood there on the stairs for a terribly long time. I whipped around to run, but I couldn't move then either. My heart rate increased at his face alone; Archibald Snatcher in my head looming over an almost-seven year old girl, clutching that terrible belt in his grasp. But then I thought of Genevieve; her gentle face, sweet demeanor, the way other gentleman tipped their hats to her for her family's own respectability. I folded my letter and clutched it tightly. \"Father loves respect. He'd be happy if I'm still Genevieve's friend…\" I widened my eyes and nodded. Hurrying down the steps, I searched through the dining area's drawers and eventually found an empty envelope. I inserted the letter, sealed it and sprinted to the door. However, once I reached it, I had to stop once more. \" You can't leave without him. He'll surely kill you if you set foot outside.\" \"No! He promised, he wouldn't.\" \"Maybe so, but he'll put you in your box again. He'll never let you see the light of day again.\" \"He hasn't done that since-\" \"He kept you from leaving the first time. You'll never be free again. Genevieve is lost to you fore-\" \"SHUT UP!\" I threw my head down, shut my eyes tightly, and plastered my hands to my face. \"…Miss?\" The wide pair of plates on my face were my eyes, opened and huge. I looked up and before me stood Mr. Pickles. The kindly beanpole had emerged from the front door and held up his hand, as if ready to say something. He noticed my letter, and the moment I had too, I furiously sprinted away. \"Miss Pepper? Miss Pepper, come back!\" I tripped and fell in an attempt to pause. \"OW!\" I cried out. The letter flew out of my little hands as I collided with the ground. For a moment, I laid there in silence on the boarded floor, and all I could hear was another small voice. \"…hello…\" My eyes fluttered open at the sound. It wasn't me, and it wasn't the voice in my head. It was…someone else… \"Oh good heavens!\" Mr. Pickles cried as he followed after me. He knelt before me and lightly took my hands as I tried to sit up. I tried so hard to fight back my tears, but who was I kidding then? \"Whatever's the matter, Ma'am?\" Mr. Pickles asked. I shook my head. \"N-nothing!\" I exclaimed. \"Miss, would you please tell me?\" he asked. I nibbled my bottom lip, because I had to do whatever the Red Hats asked of me. \"P-p-please don't tell Mr. Snatcher! If he finds out I want to send a letter, he'll-he'll,\" I covered my mouth in disbelief. \"Oh there, there, I-\" the man replied. His face contorted into genuine confusion. \"Miss, what on Earth happened to your hair?\" he asked. I blushed as my thin fingers ran through its short strands. \"Umm, my Father snipped it off.\" The man was taken aback. \"...how come?\" \"He said he needed it for an 'experiment',\" I explained. He picked up the letter and unfolded it. Pepper quickly dashed up and stole it back from him. I held it tight to my chest and stepped away from him. \"Miss Pepper, is that for a friend of yours?\" I nodded regretfully. \"…back home, sir.\" He smiled once more. \"Ah! You must want to let them know you're doing alright, huh?\" I nodded again. Mr. Pickles climbed to his feet and pulled me up gently with his hand. \"I think we have some spare envelopes and stamps and whatnot.\" \"…really?\" \"Yes, Ma'am. Here, let me see the envelope?\" He asked. I watched him examine it, as if looking for errors. \"Miss, you forgot the stamp!\" He pulled out a random one from a drawer and stuck it to the left corner of the envelope. \"We good guys need to send a good envelope with our letters.\" \"Using stamps is considered a heroic thing?\" \"Well…when you mail letters, I suppose,\" Mr. Pickles replied in his own carefree way. Mr. Pickles always was passionate about heroics. He pulled out an inkwell and quill. \"Now, who are we sending this to?\" \"Miss Genevieve Gutierrez, daughter of Lord Gutierrez.\" \"Genevieve Gutierrez? Isn't she your wealthy friend from London?\" \"Well, she's from Spain, but she and I became friends when she sailed into the Thames with her parents earlier this year.\" \"Ah, that's right, Mr. Snatcher told us you'd mentioned that to him.\" I gave him Genevieve's address and stared at his penmanship. While Father's appeared quite elegant and practiced, Mr. Trout's seemed too small for comprehension, and Mr. Gristle's looked huge and choppy, his seemed more like continuous loops, rather than actual letters. \"I hope I can write as well as you and Father someday.\" Mr. Pickles shrugged. \"Well...I don't think mine is that bad. The Boss' is far better than mine.\" I shrugged in return. \"I guess, \" I replied. \"...Mr. Pickles?\" \"Yes, Miss?\" \"When I fell just now, I think I heard voices.\" \"Voices?\" \"Yeah...one in my head...and one outside of my head. The second one said 'hellooo',\" I explained. The man suddenly fell stiff, as if he'd just said a terrible word. He nervously glanced at my letter and then at me. \"Oh, not to worry, it was me, you see. I wanted to see if you could hear me! When you didn't, I said 'good heavens!' and helped you up.\" His toothy grin still remained a little stressed, and I parted my lips to ask more questions. \"B-but anyway! I'd better send this letter for you! Wouldn't want to take you with me and scare the Boss.\" \"Scared?\" I asked. \"Well...as scared as someone like the Boss can be.\" \"Ah, OK, that makes more sense.\" Mr. Pickles pulled out an old silver watch from his pocket (not quite like the fancy gold one Mr. Snatcher used), and saw the time. \"Well, if I leave for the post office now, with no detours, I should be back for curfew. Then, if we have time, I can help you make supper for you and the Boss.\" \"Really? You can do that?\" \"Why not? The Boss can be quite...\" he lowered his head to my ear. \"...stingy-\" he said in a gentle whisper. \"Oh...\" \"...when it comes to this sort of thing. Lately I've been meaning to ask you if you wanted help anyway, so I'll be happy to oblige, if you want it.\" \"Oh yes, Mr. Pickles! I want to make Father happy! He's hardly ever pleased with my cooking, and I've always been too scared to ask him for help. Besides, he's always busy with business stuff anyway.\" Mr. Pickles frowned. The Boss was always so terribly busy, wasn't he? He gave me a determined look and a nod. \"I'm sure the Boss won't mind if I helped a little. Here, let me go to the postman; then, I'll come back to help! Maybe in the meantime, you can dust the kitchen table, chairs, and counter. That'll definitely make the Boss happy.\" \"OK!\" I replied, scurrying away to work. I watched Mr. Pickle she until he had closed the door, completely gone. \"How exciting!\" I squeaked to myself. If I learned how to cook properly, maybe Father will be nicer, then maybe I'll finally be happy here. Right? Only time would tell. As I pulled out the feather duster, I suddenly remembered something else. My seventh birthday...I grinned at the very idea of what I could find. Maybe a pristine porcelain doll with bright beautiful eyes and deep red lips; maybe a classic, like Tiddlywinks or Marbles. I could only imagine. That was all I could think of, so much so that the next time I heard something, I merely dismissed it as my thoughts and nothing more. \"Helloooo...\"[Chapter 14] Free Pepper Chapter 14 On the morning of October 14th, I woke up as a seven year old. I hurried out of bed quicker than usual that day to find the prettiest dress I had. I couldn't feel any change in me, that didn't stop my stomach from fluttering at the idea of how the day was meant to go. I picked out a red dress with puffed long sleeves, my flat red girl's hat, pure white stockings, and my favorite pair of shiny black shoes. Though my hair was still as short as a boy's, I tried to comb it as nicely as I could all the same. I examined my look as well as I could, because Father insisted on perfection and neatness. For his sake as well as my birthday's, I'd give him as much perfection as I could. I was quite proud of the white bow that sat proudly on her chest, lined with white buttons from there up to my neck. I cleared my throat and as I looked into my full bodied mirror. Taking a deep breath, I quietly left my room. As I walked down the hallway, just like any other day, I suddenly froze before I could reach the top of the steps. I could hear footsteps, the grumbling of masculine voices, and a loud winding sound. The walls around me rumbled as the sound progressed. I warily approached the top of the steps and dropped my jaw in shock. The floor was moving. Though some of the floor was made of concrete, the center of it came with wooden planks instead. I only address it now because the floor of wooden planks had apparently parted, but were now gathering back together. Though I had heard rumbling in my room before, I'd never bothered to ask (I always was reluctant to ask Mr. Snatcher too many questions). But now, before me were gathering floors and the four Red Hats themselves. Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout's faces were of neutrality, while Mr. Gristle had his own typical grin and widened eyes. Mr. Snatcher, however, looked very proud of himself, with his long, slender hands resting where his huge belly met his hips. They all looked down at the space that had opened under the floors. All I could catch was a blur of brown hair, and...several boxtrolls? I stepped down the stairs as lightly as I could, trying hard to keep my lips sealed and my voice down. One boxtroll in particular, with a box marked 'Mints' looked up at me and twitched its ears. I recognized it for sure; Mr. Trout had carried it away the first night I'd ever seen these men. We locked eyes until the floor had sealed itself back to how they'd been before. \"MINTS!\" Mr. Gristle's piercing voice broke my trance and made me flinch uncontrollably. The other three men looked up at me, making Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout shift uncomfortably in their places, and Mr. Snatcher appearing strangely sheepish. The momentary silence was terrible, so I grasped my skirts and dared to make the first move. \"Father, why do the floors move? Why are there boxtrolls under the floor? Why?\" I asked as I made it to the foot of the stairs. Father appeared a little sheepish at first. \"You stooges!\" he suddenly snapped at his three men. \"D'you forget to check on the kid again?!\" Mr. Gristle pouted and Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout looked utterly confused. \"...ridiculous ol' twits bafflin' me with their...\" he grumbled. His sneer softened as he approached me, stroking his necktie. I clung to the railing of the steps. \"Oh, my sweet little seven year old...\" he began. I weakly smiled. His tone was like syrup, sickly sweet and flowing as if he had rehearsed this explanation for many weeks now. \"Unfortunately there are still many boxtrolls hiding under Cheesebridge today. Because we catch so many at a time, we hold them in the Basement until the time of their demise.\" My face turned neutral at the low tone his voice took at the very mention of their awaiting death; just the very idea of him looking forward to their end, shook me to my core. I tried hard not to show it, but something told me that he could. He knelt down before me, and placed a dramatic hand to his chest. \"That's why I'd have to be very angry if I found you down there, my dear.\" He extended his arms behind him towards the wooden flooring. \"I slay them down there-\" he then held out his arms towards me. \"-to protect you up here,\" he explained with a wide smirk. My smile increased just a little. He patted my head and sent his men away (two of them still looked quite confused). Once the front door was closed, and we were alone, he firmly grasped my hand, and led me to the breakfast table. \"Now, Pepper dear, enough of this little chatter.\" \"...hello?...\" Snatcher stomped on the wooden boards. \"What was that?\" I asked. \"Just those pests again, child. Pay no attention to them. Manipulative little beasts,\" he explained. \"I heard a 'hello' too, Daddy,\" I explained. He stopped abruptly, making me accidentally bump into his tall, lean legs. He looked over his shoulder. \"You did?\" he asked, with a curved eyebrow. \"Y-yes, sir.\" \"Hmm...\" he rumbled. \"Did you see anything?\" \"No.\" \"Did you hear anything?\" \"No. Mr. Pickles told me it was just him, but it came from under me...\" I tried to explain despite the look of displeasure on his face. He put a finger to just below his bottom lip in thought. \"...can't have that,\" I heard him mumble. \"What'd you say?\" I asked. Father curled his arm around me and practically pushed me close to him. Bumping into his legs and round gut, it bothered me, though just a little. \"You can't have these senseless episodes, my darling. One shouldn't listen to voices in a head with no owner; a waste of time and lacks sense and propriety. I'm sure it was my loyal stooge trying to speak to you here in the Real World where we belong; simple logic. You needn't worry of such things. Let's have some breakfast, Pepper.\" He pulled out a plain chair and pushed me in once I sat down. I watched him as he opened a cabinet and pulled out a mason jar of with the picture of a strawberry on it. As he studied it, he groaned and gave it a disapproving look. \"Very naughty...\" I heard him say. I must've voiced my intrigue because he looked back at me and smiled. \"Pepper, how would like some jelly on bread?\" \"Can I add butter too?\" I asked. \"Of course! It is your birthday after all. The first of many we get to spend together,\" he left the jelly jar on the counter and placed his hands on my shoulders. He hung my hat on the ears of my chair. \"We've had a lovely few weeks together, haven't we? A little rocky at first, but so very good the rest of it,\" he explained, brushing my bangs from my face. I smiled, albeit a little nervously, but he didn't seem to react. I watched on as he spread button on four slices of bread, and grilled them with eggs on separate pans. After placing them all on plates, he spread a little more butter, and then jam. A little too much for my taste, but I never would've said so; not in front of him anyway. I soon noticed that he'd added one slice of bread and two eggs on one plate, then the other three slices of bread and three eggs on the other. He gave the first plate to me. As was typical of my Father, it all tasted amazing. \"Father?\" I was bold enough to ask. \"Yes?\" he asked. \"Are we still going to the Toy Shop today, like you promised?\" He looked me up and down and ran his fingers through my short hair. \"You've earned the privilege, I'd say. Unfortunately, the White Hats don't pay my men and myself as much as they should, so let's just have one item, like we discussed, hmm?\" he replied. \"Thank you, Father!\" \"Yes, yes, now finish up.\" I certainly couldn't argue with that. ... I was particularly proud of myself for picking the dress I wore as we walked along the paths of the town. It helped to better match Mr. Snatcher's fancy gloves he wore with his rings, heirloom cane, and intricately patterned socks in the cooler weather. Fallen leaves were scattered all over the sidewalk and twirled around during every gust of wind. Before we left the factory, he'd given his usual lecture of staying by his side at all times, but stressed the importance of holding my red hat, so it didn't fly away. With one hand on his arm, and the other on my hat, I tried to stay as focused as possible. It was hard to as I grinned over what kind of toy I could be taking home. \"Good day, Mr. Snatcher,\" the sound of a foreign voice, brought me back to reality. \"Ah, Mr. Lovette, always a pleasure,\" my Father replied. Walking up to us came a slender, older man with a gentle enough looking face. Unlike most people, who seemed a little nervous around us, especially him, Mr. Lovette always appeared as if he had seen enough of the real world to show little fear towards anything nowadays. \"Is this the nice girl I've heard so much about?\" he asked. I was about to open my mouth before my Father stepped ahead of me. \"Ah, yes, delightful little girl, isn't she? Introduce yourself, Pepper.\" I stepped forward and performed a small curtsied. \"It's a pleasure to meet you,\" I said in as nice a tone as I could muster. Mr. Lovette took my hand and kissed it, like a gentleman towards a proper lady. \"The pleasure is all mine. I've heard you're from London,\" he replied. I beamed. \"Yes! And it's my birthday!\" I announced cheerfully. \"And how old are you?\" he asked. I squared my shoulders and said in a proud tone, \"I'm seven, sir!\" \"Seven?! Well then...\" He looked at Mr. Snatcher. \"...you've got a real lady there, sir.\" \"I agree, kind sir.\" He put his downward pointing hands on his belly and put on a sympathetic face. \"The poor child was the saddest, most frightened little thing I'd ever seen in my life. If I'd done nothing, Heaven knows where she'd be now.\" \"Probably underground with the Boxtrolls?\" Mr. Lovette asked. \"Well, their rivers of blood and mountains of bones anyway...\" Mr. Snatcher added. I trembled a little at those words. \"Oh dear, I-I don't know about that,\" Mr. Lovette replied. \"And why not?\" Mr. Snatcher asked. \"I've seen them for myself, sir. No one deserves a fate so awful; especially the most defenseless of us,\" Father ran his fingers through my short hair. I smiled and nodded at him; his eyes at that point were unusually kind. As they spoke of me, I looked back and forth at them as they discussed my ladylike qualities. Though they barely looked down at me, I couldn't help, but feel a little grateful. Father was right about one thing; I do love being a lady. I appreciated my nice dresses, shiny shoes, the teatimes, and having such an influential father. Being a lady was quite enjoyable as I hoped it would be. I just wished Father would let me speak outside of 'hello's' and 'goodbye's'. \"I for one am quite proud of the person of value she'll become. Under the proper tutelage-\" he placed a hand on his chest once more. \"-a real orphan becomes a real lady.\" A person of value... It sounded quite nice to me; becoming a valuable person. Mr. Snatcher was certainly a valuable person. The town exterminator and boxtroll expert certainly put thought and effort into his appearance, speech (despite a thick accent very similar to mine), and his grand plans and goals for the future. In the weeks I'd known him, I'd only caught a small glimpse of how diabolical, dramatic, and powerful he truly was in so many ways. When I wasn't trembling in his wake at the very thought of The Strap, a destructive comment, or anything else that could make him angry, I found him...admirable. I instinctively placed a hand on my cheek. \"Well, we must be off then. My little Miss has earned a birthday present, and t'would be best if we got to it, yes?\" he admitted, brushing a finger across my cheek and the base of my chin. \"Y-yes, sir.\" \"Dear little lady, isn't she?\" he asked Mr. Lovette. \"Thank you, sir,\" I was bold enough to say. As my Father led me away, his grip grew just a little bit tighter. When he almost tugged me away down turned onto Gouda Lane, his smile immediately disappeared. \"Precarious ol' goat...\" ... The widest grin I'd ever seen arose on my face, as I glanced up at him for one last validation. \"Well, go on.\" I sped into the store as quickly as I could. He followed after me, hooked his pointer finger under my collar and pulled me back. \"Remember,\" he whispered. \"One thing.\" I nodded before he let me go. The shop was nice and warm in comparison to the cool, crisp autumn world outside. Appearing quite large to me, and divided into sections, from left to right, I found that each section was dedicated to a different age group. Larger and softer toys for ages birth to three, slightly smaller toys for ages four to seven, and even smaller toys like bags of marbles and Tiddylwinks for big kids. Each section had its own sides; for instance, in ages birth to three, there were both pink and blue bears, lions, hippos, elephants, and many others, color coordinated and on opposite sides of each other. For ages four to seven, there were building blocks and plastic motorcars on one side, and baby dolls and tea sets on the other. The big kids' section's distinctions weren't visible (and if they were, I couldn't tell). Every toy in the shop, save the ones for babies, appealed to me in some way. On one hand, I could build castles and recreate the guild mansion with building blocks, but on the other, my own little tea party sounded incredibly smashing. I turned to smile at Mr. Snatcher, who was standing in a corner with his hands behind his back, merely watching. As I look back, he gave off the impression that in a store filled with other well dressed children around pulling on dolls, and stuffed animals, there was a gleam of irritation on his face. Children and their families began to notice him standing there in the most dignified pose he could make. He would glance at another child every now and then and grimace at their grubby little hands tossing bouncing balls to each other, with their dripping noses, squealing voices, and awkward little faces looking up at his. For a man who often promoted their protection from monsters, Archibald Snatcher never did like children very much. Still, I explored the rest of the store and maneuvered around the other customers to look through toy bins full of wigs and costume pieces, reached for a rack of silly hats, and fawned over dollhouses and makeshift castles. I couldn't help but giggle with the other children as they played games all over the floor while their parents conversed with themselves. \"Pepper!\" I turned around and near the checkers and chessboards, I found someone that made my jaw drop in shock. \"Abigail!\" I cried, as a beautiful blonde girl appeared with a fragile doll with just as yellow hair. Just as she'd been the day we met, her dress was silky, gorgeous, and extremely frilly. I was jealous, but at the same time, so very glad to know her. \"Where have you been? I haven't seen you since you dropped in three months ago!\" \"I've been with my new Daddy.\" \"You have?!\" \"Yeah, today's my seventh birthday!\" \"Happy Birthday!\" \"Thanks,\" I giggled. We hugged each other tightly, and complimented her doll (one that could've been her identical twin if it matched her size). Its hair was quite soft and bright and its eyes were a greenish hazel, complimenting its fairer features. \"So, tell me, who's your new father? Tell me! Tell me!\" she said, as she twirled her ringlets through her fingers. \"He is,\" I replied, pointing to Mr. Snatcher. Abby gasped and stepped back. \"The Troll Man? He's your father?\" she asked in surprise. Mr. Snatcher turned his head toward them and curved an eyebrow at us both. We both felt a chill up our spines as he stepped towards us. \"Pepper, my sweet, who's this?\" he asked. Abigail positively froze. \"Th-this is one of my friends I made before we met. This is Abigail,\" I tried to explain. He nodded and seemed to recognize her, as he locked eyes with her curly blonde hair. \"Miss...Nibble, am I right?\" \"Y-Yes, sir,\" Abby confirmed reluctantly. Father seemed to notice. \"Good to know that my Pepper has found nice friends in nice places, Miss,\" he explained as cordially as he could. He took her hand, causing a flinch in my friend and kissed it. Abby curled her lips inward in reluctance. Another man slipped into our encounter. A tall man with a long nose and powdered wig lightly took Abby by her free arm. \"Abigail, it's crowded in here. Let's pick something and go, ay?\" \"Well, well, Wilbury Nibble Q.C.,\" Mr. Snatcher greeted. \"Mr. Snatcher,\" he replied curtly. \"Had any successful cases lately?\" my Father asked. \"Recently, yes! Any caught boxtrolls recently?\" the lawyer replied. \"Very many, thank you,\" Mr. Snatcher replied smugly. \"I see someone who belongs to me has found a friend in someone that belongs to you!\" he continued. Mr. Nibble's tense face softened at the sight of me. \"It's her birthday,\" he finished, in a matter-of-fact kind of tone. Unlike Mr. Lovette, who appeared as polite as he could be to both of us, Mr. Nibble and Mr. Snatcher poured venom into each other, to the point that only mine and Abby's presence were enough to keep Mr. Nibble contained. My Father wasted no time in gloating. \"I took in this pretty little thing just three months before. Glad to know that my daughter has such good taste in friends. At least, I hope so.\" Mr. Nibble seemed particularly sour at my father's words. He cleared his throat. \"I hope the same for yours,\" his smile at me was surprisingly genteel. I partly felt relieved that his annoyed faces were mostly geared at my Dad. Still, I thought, what did both of him have to do to make mine so smug, and Mr. Nibble so...bitter? \"Abby, let's go. Miss Snatcher,\" he nodded courteously at me and spared one last glance at Mr. Snatcher before he took Abby's shoulder. She reluctantly waved at me. \"Bye...\" she whispered. \"Bye, Abby!\" I cried out, waving profusely. Father winced at my pitch. \"Pepper!\" he spat. \"Keep your voice down. Remember what I've told you about nice, soft voices.\" \"Y-yes, Father, of course, it's important to have nice, soft voices,\" I replied. He smirked as they walked away. \"Good; also, you would be wise to keep the lawyer's daughter in your confidence. Men of certain positions in this town are valuable to us. I'm quite proud of you,\" he explained, petting the top of my head. \"Th-thank you, Father.\" \"Of course, my dear, now pick something. This store is a little too...cheerful for my taste,\" he replied, grimacing at other children smearing paint on their faces without a parent in sight. He lightly pushed me forward, making me step forward. I blinked a couple times as I search around some more. Near the cashier's counter, in a cluster of soldier action figures, I found something that made me stop in my tracks in the best possible meaning of the word. She was stunning, magnificent, and had to be mine. A plush doll sat next to the soldiers, as if cheering them on as they marched. She had long light brown and almost dark blonde hair tied in yellow silk ribbons, wore a stitched a red and blue plaid dress, white socks, black socks made of fabric, and a blue mop cap. Though her face was of fabric and two dimensional, on it were two deep blue eyes, light brown freckles, and plump red lips. Her lips, as well as the red in her plaid dress were the color of roses. She was soft enough to put anywhere, small enough to carry around, yet big enough to cuddle when I'd fall asleep; perfection in my eyes. I delicately lifted her up and smiled widely at her. I held her tightly and kissed her rosy pink cheek, and showed her to my father. \"Isn't she beautiful?\" He didn't look particularly impressed. He took her from me and looked her up and down. I wasn't too surprised at his analytical reaction. \"I suppose so...\" he replied, sounding unimpressed. \"Her name is Rosie!\" I officially announced. \"Already got a name, eh?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir, I love her!\" \"Very well...\" he concluded nonchalantly. He took her hand and brought her to the cashier's counter. There, they found an older woman, who had just finished helping the Nibbles before they swiftly left. The cashier returned to her register and was surprised to find none other than Mr. Snatcher there himself. \"Oh, good morning, Mr. Snatcher.\" \"Good morning, Mrs. Collette.\" \"Never known you to come in here.\" He held up my Rosie. \"Well, my new little darling's birthday is today, so I thought I'd come and get her something for her good behavior,\" he explained. Mrs. Colette looked down at me and we sincerely smiled at each other. \"I've heard of you! You're Miss Pepper Snatcher, yes?\" \"Yes, Ma'am,\" I responded with Father's permission. I curtsied to her as well. \"Ah, she's adorable! I almost can't believe it. You, Mr. Snatcher, a family ma-\" \"I WANT BOTH TOYSSSSS!\" \"Miss, we'll get the other one another day.\" \"IT MIGHT NOT BE HERE NEXT TIME!\" \"We only have so much to spend, Ma'am.\" \"IT DOESN'T MATTER, NANNY!\" My heart in my chest flipped over at the sudden screeching of childish screams and a much calmer voice trying to soothe it. I whipped my head around and watched in alarm as a chubby child in especially frilly clothes and bows was grasping two alabaster dolls with curly hair and silky dresses, just as frilly as hers. Beside her was a frighteningly nervous nanny who couldn't have been older than seventeen years old. Mr. Snatcher didn't bother to look, but with both hands clapped onto the knob of his fancy walking cane, I noticed their unrest. His head was bowed low and lips tightly shut. As the child pressed on and on for two expensive looking dolls instead of one, his lips gradually curled into a sinister scowl, as his ring clad hands continued to shake. \"BUT THEY'RE BOTH TOO PRETTY. IF I LEAVE ONE HERE, I'LL HATE YOU FOREVER!\" \"No-no-no, please, Miss-\" \"F-Father?\" I asked carefully. Clutching his knob tightly to the point of straining his muscles, he eventually reached into his inner jacket pocket and practically ripped out a leather wallet. He pulled out a £20 pound note and with tense hands placed it into Mrs. Collete's withered hand. She seemed to notice his silence too, and quickly gave him his change. He jammed the doll into my chest, grabbed my hand tightly, and leered at the nanny, watching her relent as she regrettably accepted both dolls for the now red faced girl. The nanny turned around to go to the cashier's counter when she accidentally bumped into my Father's protruding midsection. \"Oh! M-Mr. Snatcher, I apologize. I didn't see you there,\" the teen replied shyly. Some light brown hair fell into her face, which she tried to hide over her forehead. My father's scowl turned into a small smirk. \"Not a problem, my dear. Although...\" he put his lips to the teen girl's ear. \"...strictly between us, you would do well to teach your charge to adopt a more civil tone in public, especially in a gentleman's presence.\" I could tell that the girl's body shuddered at the sound of his low, stern voice. She nodded her head, clearly intimidated. \"Y-yes, sir...\" \"Good show, you two have a pleasant day.\" My Father kissed her hand, and I curtsied, before he practically shoved me out of the child infested store.[Chapter 15] Free Pepper Chapter 14 After the Toy Shop, we stopped at a nearby cafe, The Cultured Curd on Number 28, Gouda Lane. Walking past glancing occupants, my Father offered his hat and cane to a host, and smugly escorted me through a marble floored dining hall. I was excited, albeit overwhelmed. With all the people he seemed to have connections with, and his ability to afford dining at such a lovely restaurant, I felt...impressed. As taught, I clung onto his arm and tried not to look around too much. I slipped off my gloves, before Father held open my chair for me to sit first, and slipped off his gloves and tucking them away in his pockets. I kept Rosie wrapped around my free arm. The elegance of The Cultured Curd boasted shining papered walls, curved arches, hanging paintings and overhead lights. It helped boast a classiness that suggested rectitude and respectability. The Corinthian columns between each painting brought a classical air to the dining rooms, all filled with dark wood chairs and tables, that latter of which were covered with white table clothes, one per table. Gold curtains hung in front of wide spacious windows that brought natural light into the first and second floors. Mr. Snatcher mildly pushed me up the steps to our table on the upper floor. We were given a table next to a window that showed an overcast sky. He pulled my chair out first, as he normally did, and pushed it in once I was sitting. As we dabbed our fingers in a bowl of water first and foremost, my fingers flinched at its cold temperature, but I made no complaint. Rosie sat on my lap, as I continually glanced out the window to the rustling trees, passing townsfolk, and flying leaves. We were soon given menus by a nicely dressed man in a black waistcoat and white apron. I grinned at the sight of turkey, pork, and desserts on the menu, among other options. It only reminded me of the restaurants in jolly old London, and how I longed to be able to go in and eat a real steak and bread roll, instead of just the usual fish and potatoes. I supposed that's what I got for living in on the Thames, but whatever the case, I put a finger to my chin in thought. Their turkey, bread rolls with butter cream, tea, and their pastries sounded divine to me, and it made me all the more excited when I found that they would come in courses. I was amazed. \"Father, is this one of those very important places?\" I asked. Father chuckled. \"Yes, my dear, only the most respectable sort of people would even try to come through here. Luckily, my place in this town, and that, which I'll have when I acquire my White Hat, allows myself to enjoy such a privilege.\" \"What about me?\" I asked. \"Well, if you behave well, as a lady should, I'll take you here again.\" \"Really?\" I asked with a wide smile. He appeared humored. \"Indeed,\" he said. Our first course was a choice of either rice or turtle soup. Being reminded of sea turtles, I chose rice, but Mr. Snatcher chose turtle. He kept his gaze on me as I tried carefully not to slurp. His terribly cold, gray eyes always seemed to keep an eye on me as I ate. Perhaps this was why, I think now. Maybe this was a test, and on my birthday, no less. Still, it truly did feel like an honor to be there; not at the highest with the White Hats, but just high enough on the social ladder to enjoy fancy soups, meats, and pastries, cultured indeed. I contemplated my Father with gratitude as he tucked his napkin into his shirt collar, held down by his own brown waist coat. I was particularly excited to try their bread rolls with their butter cream. I always enjoyed the smell of freshly baked bread. Reminiscing of my favorite bakeries in London, I took a long sniff of the first one I picked up, and sighed dreamily. Fresh and just out of the oven, it gave me a remarkable sense of comfort. My Father took two and seemed to notice my dreamy reaction. \"Why don't you eat it, Pepper?\" he asked, snapping me out of my daydream. I blushed as I took my first bite. It was not too salty, but not too sweet. Just right, I thought. \"I love the smell of baked bread, sir. It's very nice...\" I explained awkwardly. \"I see.\" \"What smells do you like, Father?\" I asked almost impulsively. This seemed to take him aback, for he was silent for a minute. \"...fresh cheeses and pastries,\" he finally said. I smiled and nodded. \"I love Gouda!\" \"I know you do, my pet.\" I parted my lips to remind him that he didn't include butter cream with his rolls, but I suddenly remembered his...fits... and chose not to question it. He usually didn't like the sight of me enjoying cheese without him, but today he was surprisingly lenient. He watched with a small hint of jealousy as I enjoyed our next course: our choice of protein and sides. I just had to try their boned turkey, mashed potatoes, and macaroni au gratin, while Father chose a selection of lamp, veal, baked potatoes and the largest slab of steak I'd ever seen. He didn't seem startled at all and went straight to work, eating it daintily. He was even generous enough to let me try each one. As we ate, I noticed how tired I began to feel. While my Father was always the first to comment on how just a little too thin I was, I could never control the weariness I felt at the end of larger meals. He had noticed not too long after we'd met. He tapped me on the arm during my first yawn. \"Cover your mouth when you yawn,\" he said in an almost threatening tone. \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. I hurriedly went back to eating my turkey. He hummed. \"Now, my dear,\" he suddenly resumed. \"Let's discuss this little friend I've provided for you,\" he said, motioning to my Rosie sitting in my lap. I leaned back in my chair and beamed at her. I cuddled her tightly. \"I hope you understand that your doll is also a privilege, not a right,\" he resumed. I frowned. \"Y-yes I do, sir. But I can keep her, can I?\" I asked hesitantly. Mr. Snatcher chuckled. \"Dear one, of course, you can. It is yours, but remember to behave as is necessary. Every action has a consequence after all. Necessary good behavior comes with rewards, and unnecessary bad behavior has punishments. Do you understand?\" I nodded as we began the next course. \"So...how do I know when behavior is 'nece-ssry'?\" I inquired. \"Pepper, you've known the answer to that since our first meal together. I will tell you. I'll tell you everything you'll ever need to know; especially as you get older, my little lady,\" he explained, cupping my cheek. I agreed with another nod of the head. Our host provided our last course: pastries, nuts, and fruits for dessert. Being reminded of our hats and my hair, I picked a cherry pastry with white vanilla icing. He picked a pair of pastries that had none, one strawberry and the other apple with cinnamon. He didn't enjoy them right away however, because he still had to finish the rest of his previous course. \"The screeching child,\" he said aloud. \"Sir?\" \"The screeching child in the toy store.\" \"Yes, Father?\" \"Ghastly little brat; I've never had much time or patience for them, not in my factory. I'd have to be very cross with any child that thinks she can yell and scream to get what she wants. To behave so crassly in public is the behavior of pests, and you know how I feel about pests,\" he explained before taking a rather large bite of his steak. I focused on Rosie, her beautiful blue eyes staring back with that pretty, red smile on her face. I love her so much. \"Pests don't get pretty dolls, do they?\" I was bold enough to ask. Mr. Snatcher perceived the concern in my eyes and giggled. My face fell at such a reaction. \"Of course not! You don't think the menial and dead common are worthy of most luxuries, do you?\" he asked before biting into his apple pastry. \"The closest that pests are allowed are the company of the bones and blood they've ripped from the careless and helpless,\" he bit off a piece of his strawberry dessert after saying this. \"Of course...\" I resolved. \"You've done so well since your...transgressions from your first week. Keep doing well, and you'll never have to fear losing your little friend.\" \"I'd like that very much, Daddy,\" I finished. I covered my mouth as I yawned after trying one of the cafe's dried banana slices and chestnuts. Mr. Snatcher snapped his fingers for the host and bill. I suddenly felt exhausted as I leaned back and kept my eyes only on her. When I caught a glimpse of him leaning back as well, and patting his belly, my muscles tense up. Suddenly, a flurry of thoughts swirled around in my head. The awkward feelings I had around this huge man, in terms of his intimidating nature and appearance; the way he commanded respect just by his words and dramatic hand gestures, and how little he spoke of people like the young lady with her dolls and her frazzled nanny. \"You're not going to...\" I leaned forward. He too leaned over as I whispered, \"...take care of them like pests too, are you? The girl and her nanny?\" \"No, I may be a great man due for a White Hat, but the private affairs of my fellow citizens are theirs and theirs alone. I can however suggests ways they can better themselves, such as the use of proper voices and subject manner when in public.\" \"Wow...\" \"Yes...\" he imitated. \"Finish your pastry, child. Then, we will leave.\" ... The walk back to the factory was something of a blur. I allowed a yawn to escape my lips once or twice more before drowsiness took over my senses. As we walked back, with our gloves back on our hands, our hats on our heads, and his cane in Mr. Snatcher's hand, my vision began to blur a little in exasperation. As we made it back to Milk Street, I could feel something pick me up and place me on a soft shoulder made of velvet and animal fur. He shushed me as he held me soundly. Something odd happened as I laid there in his arms, with my chin and cheek on his shoulder. Though his limbs were long and gaunt, and his hands were cold (his hard rings certainly didn't help), I felt curiously secure in the rotund man's embrace. His strong scent of mixed cigars, cologne, cheese, and meat, was second nature to me there as he held me with a long, strong hand, while the other held his walking cane. This man haunted my nightmares, turned my world upside down, and, without lifting a finger, could plaster my tiny hand to my pale cheek every time I thought of that terrible smack during that infernal Wine Incident. I bravely placed it on his back, just in front of me. A small animal hair accidentally flowed into my nostril as I took a breath, making me sneeze. He chuckled a little at such a little high pitched noise. Yet, his hold on me was firm and not too tight. I could relax on his soft body, even though any ideas of making him angry and lifting another hand at me horrified me to my core. Nevertheless, as he took me up to the factory and up the stairs, I closed my eyes and unexpectedly relaxed. ... \"Am I going to bed?\" \"It seems so.\" \"I don't want to go to bed.\" \"I'm sure you don't, but you'll do as you're told.\" \"But-\" The rest of the afternoon was relatively simple by comparison. I was sent to my room for a nap, got to write another letter in secret journal before hiding it under the bed, ate another perfectly crafted supper by my Father himself, and was even sent a 'Happy Birthday' card from his men. For a day in my new life with a man so hard to please and easy to annoy, he seemed actually peaceful. Normal grievances such as the current White Hats, pesky boxtrolls, and his men's supposedly 'doltish' demeanor, didn't seem to bother him. Whatever the case, the whole day had left me physically drained. However, I couldn't bring myself to admitting that turning in early on my birthday was a good idea. I didn't seem to need to though. As always, Father was one step ahead of me. Just before curfew, he'd sent me to my room and now, he loomed over me in my bedroom and pulled the sheets up to my chin. I held Rosie tightly in my arms, as I studied his calm face. \"What's it like, being a man?\" Mr. Snatcher rose an eyebrow, not seeming to expect that question. He smiled nonetheless and squared his shoulders. \"Interesting question for a girl at her bedtime, my sweet.\" I shrugged in an honest way, which he found quite amusing. He sat on the bed, prompting me to sit up. \"If you must know, it depends on the man in particular. Unfortunately some are quite pathetic, accepting their lot in life with no will or drive to change it. They'd rather stay in the rut they were born in, than to yearn, nay work, for something far better. Then there are the great ones; those who, like yourself, will do whatever is necessary to acquire what's rightfully yours,\" he clenched his fist and heightened his voice in volume, helping sound passionate and correct. \"Of course-\" he continued in a casual tone. \"...you're just a little girl.\" \"S-Sorry...\" Mr. Snatcher threw his head back and laughed. \"Umm...\" I was bold enough to mutter. \"Don't complain on things beyond your control, little one; that can't be helped. Besides, it's unbecoming. You are truly lucky though. The great kind of man-\" he pushed his hair behind his ear. \"-is determined and resourceful, a fine example for the betterment of oneself, even to those such as yourself,\" he explained, taking me into his lap. I cautiously allowed my short, thin body lean back to recline on his stout one. His hold felt just as tender as the one before. \"Those sad men, disguising their displeasure with their lowly status as 'thanks', are a tragic sort. Is it wrong for a man to reach for something grander?\" I was silent. \"Tell me, Pepper,\" he ordered with a more callous grip and tone. \"No, Father, it isn't!\" \"Is it wrong for a man to grab hold of an opportunity for prosperity, especially-\" he stroked my cheek with his thumb. \"-if it means advancing the life of someone else?\" \"What does 'advancing' mean?\" \"To move up.\" \"Oh...I guess not, sir.\" \"And what if a great man had to take desperate measures to acquire his rightful place in a town such as yours? Is it wrong for them to take those measures, if that's where he truly belongs?\" he asked. I looked down and twiddled my thumbs. \"...you wouldn't...do anything too mean, would you?\" I asked, thinking of our first week together. \"Much like with men, it would depend.\" \"B-But, Father, some stuff just isn't right to do...right?\" Mr. Snatcher looked away and petted the top of my head. \"My dear girl, would it matter, it that 'stuff' was? Great men, especially those with someone to care for-\" he looked down at me. \"-should do what must be done to change their lives.\" \"What if it ends up hurting someone? What about them, Daddy?\" I asked, feeling very skittish. Father smirked. \"If a disease gets in your way, wouldn't it be better to cure it before the infection spreads?\" I was silent for a moment or two before I realized what he meant. \"It must be nice being an important man,\" I finally had the courage to say. \"It is, my little mouse. The job is never done, but someone must take up the mantle and lead.\" \"I have one more question, sir.\" \"Alright, but one more.\" I took a deep breath. \"Daddy, do you hate me?\" His fingers on his free hand curled. \"Why do you ask?\" he asked, before I gulped at his suspicious face. \"It's just...\" My heart started beating fast, the more he stared at me. My body trembled, and he looked me up and down as a result. I suddenly couldn't even begin to explain myself. \"Don't be foolish, Pepper,\" he finally said. My limbs calmed and my lungs exhaled. \"What?\" He wrapped both arms around me as he looked down and rolled his eyes. \"Oh the small concerns of girls with great fathers...would I protect you and keep you safe if I hated you? Your innocence, your mousey little ways, your soft, respectful personality, and, if I may say so, your notable progress in your home schooling. Those trips to the library Mr. Trout takes you on seem to be paying off. You don't misspell nearly as much as you used to. In a job that is mostly a constant, strategic fight against bloodthirsty monsters, you are my breath of fresh air. I've never had children of my own, you see, and by now, it seems you find our relationship beneficial on both ends. Am I wrong in making such a statement?\" Everything he'd said weighed me down with amazement and fascination. Though I knew him to be largely a smooth-talker, something told me that this wasn't a lie. At least, I would often hope and pray it wasn't. When I nodded in understanding, he put me right back into bed, and tucked me back in. \"No...\" I admitted. He nodded in approval. \"You sure do know alot, Daddy,\" I concluded. He chuckled, and only responded with, \"you're too kind.\" He straightened his back and tightened his tie. \"Now, time for silence, my dear. Now, it's back to our usual schedule. Breakfast, then schooling, then perhaps an outing.\" \"I'd like that very much, Father.\" \"Of course you would! Goodnight, Pepper, sleep well.\" \"Goodnight, Father...\" He patted my head, turned off the light, and closed the door behind me. I turned to my side, sighed in disappointment, and looked at my new friend. \"What do you think, Rose?...\"[Chapter 16] Free Pepper Chapter 15 \"My Dear Friend-\" My stomach flipped over the day Mr. Gristle emerged with a letter, while Mr. Snatcher stay confined to his office. A month or so after my birthday, as the temperatures dropped, he came in, grinning over a letter, as I tossed firewood into Father's potbelly stove. When I saw the letter addressed to me, I smoothed out my puffed, long sleeved work dress and white pinafore, tapped the soot from my black work shoes, and took the letter. \"Mr. Gristle, may I sit down and read this? Maybe you could help me with the firewood?\" \"WOOD!\" That was a 'yes'. \"Thank you, sir.\" I sat down at the table, tore the envelope, and excitedly read Genevieve's message. As I figured, her handwriting was far more elegant than my own; not as much as my Father's, but far superior to mine. \"Thank you for sending your letter to me. It lifted my spirit to know that you were still out there somewhere. Cheesebridge sounds like a very odd place, and this man you've met, this Archibald Snatcher. Is he safe? Is he really a gentleman? He hasn't hurt you, has he? If you're not happy, there is a reason, yes? I still wish my parents had allowed you to stay with us permanently. You would've loved our manor in Basque County, Spain. The weather is quite nice this time of year, and I would've taught you Spanish and everything! I know that there's little time for leisure and frivolous activities, but we would've made it work. Does Mr. Snatcher educate you? Is he helping you in reading, writing, and arithmetic too? I've just recently begun practicing music and needlework. I like those things alright, I suppose. I'd much rather solve complicated multiplication tables. \"I truly miss our adventures together, sneaking away from Mama and Papa to take you through Downtown London and look at the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. Before we got found out anyway. I'm saddened that your new father had to take your money. I gave it to you , not him. But he is your new Father. From what you've described, he has to be some sort of important business man. Both you and Papa have said to me that orphans don't...perhaps, I shouldn't say.\" I nodded with a frown. \"But he's actually got a title! I know little of the business world, but it's definitely something. You've gone from no class to Middle Class over just two weeks. Maybe he will get that White Hat, and both of you will make it to the Nobility with me! Then we'll truly be sisters, in a sense. Maybe when your Father gets there, he can send a calling card to my Mama and Papa, and then we'll see each other again. \"Please send me more letters. I wish I could send someone to send mine, but perhaps mailboxes are what's best for now.\" Tu Hermana (Your Sister), Miss Genevieve Gutierrez I hugged the letter to my chest with a wide smile. \"Leeches...\" Mr. Gristle hissed. I gasped and leaned back as I found him leering over the leech aquarium, with some firewood wrapped around his arm. \"Do the leeches need cleaning, sir?\" He simply giggled and walked back to our stove. An odd man, I thought. I tucked Genevieve's letter under my bodice as he tossed his own load of wood inside. I curiously watched as I heard an unusual hum. Though his eyes and his grin as wide as they'd always been, the little tune coming from his lips surprised me. The melody sounded like an actual song, the kind one might here in a performance or even a pub's Talent Night. I tried to follow along as I intently heard each note, with each verse sounding almost the same as the other. \"Mr. Gristle, what's that you're humming?\" He giggled. My face went blank in bemusement. I folded my arms and made an unimpressed face. \"Crazy ol' Gristle,\" I thought; just like him to say and do baffling things. Regardless, I kept my thoughts to myself, especially as I thought of my father. \"Sir, do you suppose I could sit by the potbelly stove? It's freezing in here...if-if that's OK...\" when his ice blue eyes met mine, I felt a little unsettled. \"Nice...\" That meant 'request granted'. My mind was flooded with thoughts of Genevieve...in her majestic villa in the Spanish countryside. The warmth of the potbelly stove, made me think of its warm weather, the endless summer days where no long sleeved dresses were needed in the fields, hills, and valleys of her world. We could've played all sorts of games in her labyrinth of a courtyard. Then, during our spare free time, we would've had a huge mansion filled with servants all to ourselves. I thought of the day I met her, how a red feather flew away from her hat in the wind. I smiled as I recalled my firm grip onto its soft exterior before I bowed and handed it to her. Her pleased, understanding face as she accepted it gave me so much hope. People tipped her hat to her and dared not question her sooty, ill dressed companion. Then, there was the pain, that which I felt as I stood before her parents, the Lord and Lady of the House of Gutierrez of Spain. They weren't cruel, but they weren't glad to see me either...I wanted so badly to be chosen; to be adopted by a Lord and Lady and become a cultured woman in turn. They wouldn't allow it. My heart broke for the first time ever that day. I almost had a sister. Then, just like that, the dream disappeared. A tear fell as I heard Genevieve call out 'don't forget, Pepper, I love you!', as I left her and London there for the last time. I...just ran away from her from the edge of the river, where the sewer connects to the waterfront; gone for two long weeks, before I came to the Cheesebridgian Valley, where I'd stay with him...the second person to break my heart. As I sat on my knees, collecting dust and clutching my skirt, I folded my lips in. \"Miss Pepper?\" a congested voice asked from behind. I rapidly wiped the tears from my eyes and stood up. \"Yes, Mr. Trout?\" The gentle giant appeared unusually pink, especially in the nose. \"The Boss wants you. He says it's time for your needlework practice-ACHOO!\" the giant sneezed, causing me to back off a little. I swiped the dust and soot from my person and started my climb up the steps. \"In his office?\" \"Of course-ACHOO!\" he replied, covering his face with a handkerchief. \"WORK!\" My heart and stomach flipped over at the sound of the imp's voice as I hurried up the steps and into the hallway. Though I knew Mr. Snatcher would be there, I partly looked forward to going into his office. We may have had our potbelly stove downstairs for warmth in the cold months, but Father had a fireplace in his office in contrast, always lit during this time of the year. \"Lucky man,\" I would typically think. I rubbed my arms as I approached his office door, and simply stared at it for a minute, maybe two. \"Pepper!\" My shoulders twitched at the sound of Mr. Snatcher's loud, gruff tone of voice. \"Are you out there?\" he asked, as I looked down at my shoes. \"...Yes, sir.\" \"Father would like to talk to you!\" he announced. \"Coming, sir!\" I reluctantly took the curved doorknob of his office and opened it. About as dim as the hallway, it boasted book shelves, a dark wood desk with a lamp and gold plaque with his name etched in, and a large leather chair behind it, and a wooden hair in front of it. I noticed his usual cigar case, a coat rack, and stack of small rectangular papers; his stooges' paychecks, she figured. I initially couldn't believe how nice it seemed despite the low lighting. Between the desk and an extra chair was a lit fireplace, producing a welcomed glow of orange and red. Though it wasn't as large as our Mayor's (or so she'd been told), I will always admit that it was still very elegant in a business kind of way. I found Mr. Snatcher hunched over at his desk looking a parchment up and down, wearing very small, thin glasses. I rose to the tip of my toes as I leaned over in the doorway. \"F-Father?\" \"Pepper,\" he replied, looking up. He took the glasses from his eyes and motioned to the chair. Sitting upon the chair was a collection of ruffled, navy blue adornments, connected by a same colored thread and silver needle. \"Come and sit. Then, we will talk,\" he instructed in a disinterested tone. I folded my hands and slouched a little as I walked over, sat down, and picked up the needle. Father often said that needlework was a practice any lady could be proud of alone. However, this was different. \"You're taking care of it for me ; and my Experiment!\" he'd often say. The Experiment... I asked many times: \"Father, what's the Experiment? Why am I sewing up these accessories? When may I know?\" I often asked. \"All in good time, my pet. All in good time,\" he'd say. Today, I chose not to ask those questions. The quiet as he wrote little notes on the parchment was all the indication I needed. So Father and Daughter sat there in front of the toasty fireplace in complete silence. My slim fingers sneaked it ways through the fabric as I guided the pin to help connect ruffles with mock feathers and light blue gems. As I concentrated on the path of the thread, all sounds fell muted, save for the occasional snap from the flames and firewood. A tiny smile creased onto my face as I relaxed myself with the maneuver through the pattern. My eyelids lowered a little and my mind cleared. The longer I sewed, the clearer my mind fell; falling and falling into a state of peaceful felicity. The way the needle swayed so easily through the opposing material soothed my thoughts of Genevieve, melting away until my brain had wandered into a happier place. I never took my eyes off the tiny metallic line that traveled around its world so easily. I loved it, yet I hated it. \"Pepper!\" \"Y-Yes, Father?\" Listen to this song Mr. Trout wrote for our Experiment. 'Few years ago, a plot was hatched, when evil went to hunt and snatch,'...ugh, no, no, no, I was right. Remove the 'snatch',\" he rambled, scratching out words. I looked back down at my project and grinned when I saw I was just about done. I tied the thread tightly, and stood up. \"Father, may I show you my work?\" I asked standing up. He looked me up and down and beckoned me. I approached him and with shaking hands, gave him my work. He leaned back, crossed one leg over the other and hummed. He brought it closer to his face and really eyed. His hums ranged from a little optimistic, to seemingly disappointed. Then, he stopped and was completely silent. A smirk and a cheerful hum gave me a joy he'd never know. \"Acceptable, I believe you've made progress.\" He lightly tossed them onto the desk, and pulled me towards them. \"I think I can finally tell you our Experiment,\" he told me bluntly. I beamed as he placed me in his lap and pulled forward sketches of a royal blue gown and those same circular adornments of mine. \"Pepper, do you know what men in this town love more than most things?\" \"Cheese and hats, sir, like you've told me!\" I replied cheerfully. \"Oh no doubt of it...but those aren't the only things.\" \"No?\" \"No...the men in this town love a jolly good show. Of course, we haven't had a fine arts district since my special curfew came into effect. Ballets, plays, concerts, any kind of organized show became a thing of the past; a luxury that wouldn't return until the destruction of those bloody pests of ours.\" \"Ballets?\" I asked with a slightly hopeful tone. \"I've heard of such things. I've always wanted to go to one of those shows. Maybe even be in a play someday!\" \"Rrrreallyyy...\" he asked in an amused tone. He leaned back again and rested a chin on his pointer finger. \"Would you like to be in a play, my sweet?\" \"Yes! But-but what about the Boxtrolls? Are they dead yet?\" \"Unfortunately, no...but just because our fine arts talent has become null and void doesn't mean we simply can't make more.\" My eyes grew as large as plates and all my teeth showed as a beautiful scenario appeared in my head. I sighed and lowered my eyelids dreamily. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the Performer of the Year Award goes to Mademoiselle Pepper Le Snatcher, the finest ballet dancer, actress, and singer of the Cheesebridge Opera House! Raised by the finest Red turned White Hat in town, Pepper grew from rags to riches in just a matter of months. She trained for years under the tutelage of fine instructors, overcoming many obstacles and pleasing the masses with her voice and dance. The Belle of the renewed Cheesebridge Opera House, and a fine example of perseverance combined with technique and passion, Mademoiselle Snatcher serves as a shining example that even orphans can do and be great things. She would like to personally thank Mr. Archibald P. Snatcher, her father and Chief of Security. Watch her strong, slender form glide to the stage, her long hair as red as a rose, and her glistening eyes the color of chocolate. Isn't she...beautiful? \"Pepper!\" \"Y-Y-Yes, Father?\" Mr. Snatcher gave me a stern look, as my head flinched back into reality. His face was positively unimpressed, and I blushed terribly. \"I...I guess I was day dreaming...\" \"Clearly,\" he bluntly stated. \"You'd be wise not to daydream while people are speaking to you. It's unbecoming, especially for a lady.\" \"Yes, Father, of course...\" \"Good, because if you cease this little habit, I shall allow to do just that,\" he said, pointing a finger up with a grin. \"...Day dreaming?\" He rolled his eyes. \" No , you ridic-\" he put a hand to his face and shook his head. I shrugged in awkwardness. \"I mean, be in a play!\" he confessed, annoyed. My jaw dropped. \"A play? I get to be in a play?\" He seemed pleased with that reaction, because he smirked as he nodded. \"I'd love to be a real performer!\" I squealed. \"And so you will,\" he confirmed, reaching over and plucking a strange little shape from a drawer at his right below his desk. \"What do I get to do, Daddy? Can I play a princess? Or a knight? Or an explorer? I'm not picky...\" Mr. Snatcher chuckled at me. \"No...\" my face fell. \"You'll be something far better.\" He grasped the shape and pulled it down onto the top of my head. He tied the baby bonnet under my chin, just a little too tightly. I winced a little at his cold hands tying up my face, before caressing it, a subtle code that nothing was wrong. In fact, everything was right. His cold gray eyes studied my heart shaped face. Usually understanding of my Father's Codes, as I liked to call them, I had a moment of doubt. Thankfully, he hummed in approval. \"Perfect, you'll make a fine Trubshaw Baby.\" My eyes widened into disbelief. \"I'm playing the Trubshaw Baby in your play?\" \"You certainly are. You have the second most important part in our little musical. Poor little Arthur Trubshaw disappeared a year and almost a half ago. It will be your job to keep his memory alive in our little skits, recreating his awful demise. Poor boy...\" his tone lowered. \"...if only I'd gotten my hands on him...\" I curved my eyebrow. \"But no need to dwell on the past!\" he leaned forward and grasped my arm in a surprisingly gentle way. \"'Tis time to work for m-our future,\" he promised, leaning forward. His chilling hands flipped my stomach over, before I had the nerve to try and give them back to him, but despite his gaunt arms, he proved to be much stronger than me. His grip on my arm pulled me a tiny bit towards him. \"B-But, Father, when are we going to perform? Is it a C-Christmas play?\" Snatcher threw his head back, laughed, and let go. \"Of course not!\" he replied, guffawing at me. I looked him up and down myself, and couldn't help but smirk too. Mr. Archibald P. Snatcher as Father Christmas? I should say not... \"We won't perform until next July; just in time for the next Trubshaw Baby Remembrance Day! A reenactment to remind our neighbors of why Red Hats brave the streets in the first place!\" I nodded along the way. \"...I suppose that makes sense.\" \"Of course it does!\" \"But, Father, if I'm the second most important part, who's the most important part of our play?\" Snatcher chuckled at me once more, as he pulled out a file drawer and pulled out a strange wad that reminded me of something strikingly very familiar. It was my hair. My clumped, deep red locks were all conjoined in a huge curling cluster of hair, creating the most peculiar wig I'd ever seen. On one hand, it looked meticulously detailed and boasted an outrageous kind of voguish taste. On the other hand however... \"You used my hair to make a wig?\" He didn't respond. Instead, he plucked a tight, elastic cap from that same drawer, hid his dark brown hair under the cap, and fastened the wig on top of his head. He picked out a royal blue fan from another drawer, flashed it open and hid his face behind it. \"Oui, Mademoiselle.\" My jaw dropped. The voice he'd adopted was high pitched and very feminine, a voice that made my insides flip over in shock. He rolled down his long shirt sleeve, and slipped on my finished armband. \"Ah,\" he continued. \"It is perfection, my darling. I knew I could count on my leetle angel!\" I was utterly speechless. He removed the wig and cap, and placed them both in my hands. \"You see, my love, I am truthfully Madame Frou Frou! A poor, fashionable victim of the Boxtrolls, the beasts that destroyed my dear hometown, Crackerslovakia! They destroyed all of it, so now it is my life's mission to sing of my woes to neighboring countries and praise the efforts of the bold men that purge them from this world! And you , my charming assistant-\" he cupped my face in his long cold fingers. \"-will be my supporting star! My Trubshaw Baby!\" I couldn't say a word. All I could do was look at him in disbelief. My hair...he was wearing my hair... \"So...does this mean I have to call you 'Mother' from now on?\" \"No.\" \"Oh.\" Back to his normally rumbling tones, he tilted his head and examined me from the top of my head to my toes. \"Well...not when Madame Frou Frou is on hiatus anyway,\" he explained. \"Pepper, as you get older, you will find that the men in this town are quite infatuated by certain women.\" He placed me back on the floor and left his chair to look out a tall lean window, curtained with blood red. \"Tall... curvaceous women of entertainment quality and grace.\" He looked me up and down. \"Unfortunately, all I have are three dim stooges and a bony girl who gets sick easily and trips too often.\" I looked down at my shuffled feet. He tilted my chin upward to look at him. Bent forward and grinning encouragingly, something in me warned me of him. \"But you four aren't entirely hopeless. Quite useful actually. Luckily, I have some theatrical experience myself, and will lead you all well.\" \"Father, you're an actor?\" He smirked. \"Well, I was. When I was your age, I'd sneak away from my Father, your Grandfather, to take part in Cheesebridge's fine arts district, mostly acting. Much like yourself, I played young characters then, even a few ladies. Of course, my Father never thought well of such things, but I disagree. The fine arts are a capital way to send the proper messages to your fellow man.\" \"Is 'Crackers-vokia' a real place? I don't want to lie.\" He patted my head. \"You needn't worry of that, dearest.\" \"But, Father, you hate it when I lie.\" \"When it's against me and my men.\" I looked away confused. He petted my head, making me smile a little. \"You worry too much. Just follow my lead, and all will be made clear. Understand?\" \"Yes, Father.\" ... He sent me away for a break. I couldn't help but run my own fingers through my still short hair. I looked up at my fingers and hummed as I entered my room and laid down. At least he was in a good mood. After tossing log after log into the heater and my needlework, a break was greatly welcomed, I figured. I put Rosie on top of my stomach and smiled at her. Then, my nose started tickling itself. I wrinkled it, and closed and tightened my face. I breathed heavily and my chest tightened. \"ACHOO!\" ","Summary":" Free Pepper Prologue \"Would you happen to have a three, Mr. Trout?\" \"Go fish, Mr. Pickles. Mr. G"}]
