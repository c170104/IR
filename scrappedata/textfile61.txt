[{"Movie":"Alien Nation","Title":"Chains of Love Afterward","Author":"MarillaT'Pel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6846938","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I didn't start watching Alien Nation again until earlier this year. I really felt bad for Marvin at the end of Chains of Love. What happened wasn't his fault, and it was all kind of funny. So this is a short little closure story. Though I do love a good slash fic, that's not what this is. This is my first Alien Nation story, so if you like it, tell me what you think! Chains of Love: Afterward Sergeant Matthew Sykes was just arriving home. He'd had a long day (not that they weren't all long) and wanted nothing more than to sit back on his couch, have a beer, watch some Three Stooges, and possibly slip into a coma for a week. He was hunched over slightly as he stood in the elevator, waiting to arrive on his floor. He stepped out of the elevator, looked up, and froze in his tracks. Standing down the hall, right in front of his door, was Marvin Gardens. The Newcomer had nearly been one in a string of men sought out by a lonely woman whose face had been burned during the Newcomer's arrival on Earth. This woman, desperate for the attention she'd received from men in the past, had drugged men she arranged dates with through an online service so that they would be enamored with her in spite of her appearance. Then, of course, the first guy she'd drugged had gone into a jealous rage and killed two other men she'd seen. Marvin escaped that fate after Matt and his partner, George had busted into the room before he actually saw Clara Bow, as she called herself. Marvin had seen him first, and that's all it took. It had been hell for Matt. Marvin had flirted with Matt in front of his co-workers, and he'd pretty much thrown a tantrum about it. It wasn't the first time a guy's advances had caused other people to tease him. The whole mess had made him look like an idiot in front of Cathy. And, to top it all off, Marvin had acted a bit like a stalker. The guy had followed Matt to his apartment, to work, and on a case, though that last one had turned out for the best. Matt had tried to be gentler with his final rejection, and had hoped that Marvin would finally get the message. As a matter of fact, the Sardonac, the drug that had led to the infatuation, should have worn off by now. Cathy had said about a month, as long as they didn't have sex. So why was Marvin here? Marvin, who'd been staring at the door, suddenly turned and saw Matt standing down the hall, which prompted him to begin walking forward. Marvin cleared his throat, rather nervously. \"Sergeant Sykes,\" he said, taking Matt by surprise, \"there's something I think I need to say to you.\" \"Uh, sure.\" Replied Matt. He unlocked the door to his apartment. It seemed safe enough. \"Come in.\" He stepped inside, shutting the door after Marvin followed him in. Marvin simply stood there, looking extremely uncomfortable. Matt decided some prompting was in order. \"So, Marvin, what'd you come to talk about?\" Marvin gave him a look that could only be described as humiliated. \"Where to begin?\" He muttered. \"The Sardonac wore off two weeks ago and I've been wondering how to explain myself.\" \"You really don't have to.\" Said Matt. \"I know all about what Sardonac does to Tenctonese.\" \"At the very least, I should apologize to you.\" Said Marvin, shaking his head. \"I've never been interested in men, but when I drank it I couldn't help but throw myself at you repeatedly. I followed you around like a lovesick child. Once the drug wore off, I realized how humiliating what I'd done was.\" Matt slowly let himself relax during Marvin's little speech. The Sardonac was out of his system. There would be no more declarations of love, no more surprise visits or embarrassing gestures. \"It's like I said then,\" he told Marvin, \"you were drugged. And I probably could have handled it better. I mean, you'd pretty much just barely dodged date rape and I wasn't very sympathetic. I just wasn't used to having a guy be so persistent. I kind of grew up with a lot of people telling me that sort of thing is wrong, you know? I don't really care what other people like, but I still get kind of freaked out when a guy comes on to me, or someone else thinks I'm gay. Besides,\" he added, seeing that Marvin was looking a little less ashamed already, \"you saved my life. That guy would have killed me if you hadn't followed me.\" \"Still,\" muttered Marvin, \"I can't believe how influenced I was by a drug. I've always known what Sardonac is used for, but I never would have thought it could make me feel attracted to another male. Or act so desperate.\" Matt shrugged. \"It happens. When I was a kid, one of my friends stole some LSD from his brother and brought it to my house to try. We decided to go one at a time in case something went wrong. I went first. He went to the bathroom after a while and when he came back to my room, I was gone. He found me in the kitchen talking to a bowl of fruit. He ended up not taking the drugs, and I never did them again.\" Marvin seemed torn between amusement and confusion. \"What does that have to do with what happened to me?\" \"It just means that a lot of times, drugs make you do things you would never normally do, and there's nothing you can do but deal with the consequences.\" Explained Matt. \"You didn't willingly take the Sardonac. You wouldn't have been chasing me if it wasn't for the drug in your system. I get that. It's over and done with, so now let's just move on. You really have nothing to be sorry for.\" Marvin nodded. \"Thank you Sergeant.\" He looked back toward the door. \"It's getting late, I should probably go.\" \"Sure,\" said Matt, walking back to the door and opening it, \"but maybe you should consider a different way of meeting women. After all, you wouldn't want this happening again.\" Marvin grinned in surprise. \"No, definitely not.\" He stepped though. \"Goodnight Matt.\" He almost looked worried when he said that, addressing Matt by name instead of rank. Matt ignored it though. \"Goodnight Marvin.\" Marvin smiled again and turned to leave. Matt shut the door behind him. He went about what he'd planned for the night; getting a beer and watching The Three Stooges on his couch. He really did wish Marvin all the best, and hoped he'd have better luck with the whole dating thing. Looking back on his behavior from over a month ago, he recalled his own previous homophobic nature which had instilled in him by his judgmental father. For a time, Matt had believed his words. Even after he'd begun to question his father's judgment, it had still caused him to mistreat decent people for fear of having that cruel attitude turned on him. Even now, after he'd managed to grow out of most of it, he still had bits of it left over, as he'd told Marvin. However, having a Newcomer partner and friends had helped him move on from a lot of his past prejudices. It was hard to hang on to all that anger and fear when having to deal with other people's hatred for a living. He shook his head. He didn't want any deep thoughts right now. There'd be time enough for thoughts about people's troubles tomorrow. Right now, he was going to relax and rest up to prepare for it. He let his mind go blank until the only things he knew were the beer in his hands and Larry, Curly, and Moe slapping each other in the faces. I've read a couple Matt/Marvin fics, and they're nice, but he was only in one episode and it wasn't enough for me to see them as an actual couple. That, plus the fact that Matt strikes me as the kind of guy who's straight and doesn't care about someone else's sexuality unless it leads other people to question his own. You know, like when a straight person decides to break off contact with a gay friend because someone else insinuates that they're gay for having a friend who is. It's just sad when that happens. The thing about the bowl of fruit was inspired by my all time favorite YouTube series, The Annoying Orange! An interesting bit of trivia for you; James Caan, who played Matt Sykes in the original Alien Nation movie guest starred in one episode as a Jalapeño pepper! I actually didn't remember that until after I wrote the story! I just thought some talking fruit sounded like a funny hallucination. I don't know what kinds of hallucinations LSD usually causes. Hope you enjoyed this, and please review! ","Summary":" I didn't start watching Alien Nation again until earlier this year.

Cuando dieron las 11:59 de la noche, todos salimos al jardín frontal para el espectáculo final, los fuegos artificiales. Pero justo a las 12:00, junto a los fuegos artificiales, una luz que titilaba de colores (verde, azul, rojo, amarillo, blanco y morado, específicamente) se dirigió a California, mi ciudad. Cuando se acabó la fiesta, me fui a mi casa en California, por un atajo que me ahorraba 500 kilómetros, una carretera recta que me llevaba directamente a California. Ya en mi casa, abrí la puerta y me encontré con un paquete que decía: Vivimir: Ya nos aliamos con los Grises, la conquista es cada vez más evidente, como todo reptiloide, tendrás que permanecer oculto hasta nuevo aviso, en la caja te mando una esfera con el poder psíquico de uno de los Grises más poderosos, al cual nos ofrendaron. -El soberano En mi cabeza surgieron muchas preguntas, ¿Vivimir? ¿Los Grises? ¿Conquista? ¿Reptiloide? ¿Permanecer oculto? ¿Poder psíquico? ¿El soberano? Pero más importante, ¿Por qué me llegó esto a mí?. La visión Esa noche no pude dormir intentando encontrar respuesta a mis preguntas. Por la mañana pensé, ¿Y si de pronto lo imaginé? , así que bajé muy rápido para ver si estaba o no la caja y, efectivamente, no estaba, o al menos eso creí por un segundo porque cuando giré mi cabeza, me encontré con la caja levitando sobre mi lámpara de lava. -Co, Co, ¿Cómo?, ¿Cómo es esto posible?- dije muy confundido. Así que me apresuré a abrir la caja y me di cuenta de lo que había ahí, una esfera que adentro tenía un humo rosa. -¿Que será ese humo? En la caja decía que era poder psíquico, pero… ¿Será?- dije intrigado. Dudando mucho de lo que iba a hacer, me apresuré a agarrar la esfera y apenas la agarré me llegó una visión muy extraña: -Desplieguen a los unicuernos- dijo el Teniente Kennedy y los unicuernos salieron galopando hacia los aliens, matando a miles. De repente, un disparo me dio en el brazo, desintegrándomelo internamente. -Rolley, ¿está bien?- dijo el teniente Kennedy- Tome esto, es el simillimum, aplíqueselo en el brazo y se le curará instantáneamente- me lanzó un frasco- ¡Cuidadoooo! En ese momento, un saurio-reptiloide de 10 metros y medio cayó del cielo. -Vivimir- dije entre dientes apretando el puñal de mi armamento. De repente, la esfera se resbalo de mis manos y se quebró contra el suelo, liberando el humo rosa, el humo se metió en mi cuerpo a través de mis manos y me dejó muy confundido. \"¿Qué pasó?\" pensé. Cuando fui a desayunar, mis huevos se prepararon solos. \"Que raro, creo que me están asustando…\" pensé. Así que desayuné rápido y salí de mi casa apresuradamente. Poderes psíquicos, parte I Apenas salí de mi casa, me dirigí al edificio de la CIA, en Washington, saqué mi auto y conduje hasta salir de California, al llegar al primer pueblo, Yosemith, le pregunte a un señor: -Buenos días, una pregunta, yo quiero ir a Washington, ¿cuánto tiempo me voy a demorar? -Desde California hasta Washington, eh?-dijo él con cara de preocupado- tiene que recorrer todo el país, aproximadamente un día y medio. -¡¿Qué?! ¡¿Un día y medio?!- exclame sorprendido- Y… Señor, ¿hay algún hotel en el cual me pueda hospedar en el camino? -Pues… Hay uno -¿En dónde?- agregué curioso - En Kansas, justo a la mitad de su camino, se llama Kansas city downtown. -Gracias señor, otra pregunta, ¿cuál es su nombre? -Mi nombre es Iván, Iván Woods. -Bueno Iván, que tenga un buen día. - Lo mismo, Adam. Las cosas raras no dejaron de pasarme, ¿cómo es que él sabía que yo venía de California?, y también, ¿cómo sabía él mi nombre?. Pero, ese no era un día como cualquier otro, no por las cosas raras, no, el 2 de enero era el aniversario de muerte de mi esposa Emily. Cuando llegué al Hotel Kansas City Downtown, pedí una habitación para una persona y me dieron una con vista al atardecer, después de instalarme, lo primero que hice fue acostarme para recuperar sueño. Poderes psíquicos, parte II -Adam, Adam- decía una voz dulce- Adam, Adam despierta, levántate. Esa voz me decía algo, pero estaba embelesado por su dulzura que no le presté mucha atención, al prestar atención, me di cuenta de que me hablaba una voz conocida. -Adam, Adam despierta- decía ella- tienes que despertar. -E…Em…ily…Emily- dije adormilado- Emily, eres… ¿eres tú? -Sí, soy yo, despierta y escúchame- dijo Emily. -Emily- dije ya despierto- tú no estabas… ya sabes… ¿muerta? -Sí, pero he venido del mas allá para darte este mensaje- dijo y puso cara seria- Tu… Tú tienes el poder para ayudar en grande a la humanidad en la guerra para derrotarlos. -¿Derrotarlos? ¿Derrotar a quienes?- dije empezándome a asustar. - Derrotar a…- Emily se veía preocupada-Derrotar a los aliens. Esa palabra retumbó en mi cabeza, ¿aliens?, ¿esa es la explicación a todo?, ¿aliens?, ¿Cómo en la visión?, ¿aliens?, ¿Cómo en la carta?. -Sí, aliens- prosiguió ella- como decía en la carta, la esfera tenía poder psíquico, y ahora, ese poder está en ti, ese poder te ayudará a derrotar a tu contraparte reptiloide, Vivimir, ese es tu destino. -¿Vivimir?- dije confundido y un poco enojado- ¿Quién es ese tal Vivimir?¿Y por que de pronto mi vida y mi destino giran alrededor de él? -¿Recuerdas el mensaje de la caja?- preguntó Emily. -Sí, el de la conquista y todo eso- dije creyendo que esa era la respuesta correcta. -Esa caja te mencionó a Vivimir por primera vez, ¿no?, bueno, pues Vivimir es un reptiloide clase saurio. Los reptiloides son una raza de alienígenas que han sido conquistadores desde siempre, pero ellos sabían a qué planetas conquistar. -Ya, pero , ¿qué es clase saurio?- dije intrigado -Los sauroides eran familiares de los reptiloides, pero a diferencia de ellos, los sauroides conquistaban y destruían la vida en cualquier planeta, ellos eran una raza tan poderosa que fue desterrada del universo, la leyenda cuenta que antes de ser desterrados, los sauroides dejaron a un descendiente que los liberaría, ese descendiente es Vivimir, por eso es tu destino destruirlo, porque si no, Vivimir liberará a los sauroides, los cuales destruirían el universo entero. Así que los clase saurio, el cual único existente es Vivimir, son los descendientes de los sauroides, tienen sus mismas estadísticas y habilidades de combate. -Ese Vivimir- dije con furia- enséñame a manejar esos poderes. -Primero, concéntrate en un objeto, por ejemplo, esa botella, concéntrate y piensa, esa botella flotará. -Esta botella flotará… Esta botella flotará… Hmmm, nada pasó, ¿que estoy haciendo mal?. -Tienes que concentrarte y encontrar tu motivación, mira. En ese momento, Emily empezó a hacer levitar a todos y cada uno de los objetos que había en la habitación. -Em, yo no sabía que tu tenias poderes psíquicos. -No los tengo, es que como soy un fantasma, puedo manejar las cosas. -Esta botella flotará- de repente, la botella se elevo en los aires y se rompió contra la pared. -Muy bien, solo tienes que perfeccionar eso. -Así que… este es el adiós, supongo. -Si, supongo. -Em, solo te quiero decir que te extraño. -Yo digo lo mismo, Adam, yo digo lo mismo… De repente, su cuerpo translucido se fue desapareciendo y sus últimas palabras fueron: -Tienes que hacerlo, gana, ayúdanos… El reptiloide Al llegar a Washington, me di cuenta de que era una capital enorme y tenía un edificio que resaltaba. Cuando llegué a la entrada del edificio, dos guardias estaban cubriendo una compuerta. -Disculpe, señor, me podría decir, ¿Dónde está el cuartel general de la CIA?- pregunté nervioso a uno de los guardias que estaba delante de la compuerta. - Non transibit - dijo el señor en un idioma que yo no entendía- Perdón, no puede pasar. -Vengo acá por unos asuntos importantes- dije decidido. -No puede pasar- dijo el guardia, con tono enfadado. -Mire, señor, déjeme pasar o…-dije empezándome a enojar. -¿O qué?- dijo de un modo retador, en ese momento no me contuve y le lancé una onda cerebral tan fuerte que lo hice chillar de dolor. Al entrar, me encontré con un pasillo de aproximadamente veinte metros de ancho y cien de largo, al final del pasillo había otra compuerta. Decidí lanzarme por el agujero y parecía infinito y cada vez se estaba haciendo más caliente, hasta llegar a creo, unos 43 °C, de repente vi una luz roja y caí en una arena café y muy suave, ese corredor era extraño, al lado de lo que parecía un ladrillo oscuro, había una corriente de lava. -Buf… Que calor…- dije sofocado por los- quien sería capaz de estar aquí. Al abrir una puerta que tenía un letrero rasgado, me encontré con un señor de corbata y traje. -Que necesita- dijo él- mi nombre es John Moore y soy el director general de la CIA. -Señor Moore- dije- tengo que reportar un caso de avistamiento reptiloide. -Un avistamiento reptiloide, ¿ehh?- dijo Moore- no hemos tenido noticias de esos reptiles desde hace 50 años, debe estar usted loco o confundido. -¡¿Loco?! ¿¡Confundido?!- dije enfurecido e hice que Moore levitara y se golpeara contra la pared- ¡NO RECORRÍ 4.494 KILOMETROS PARA QUE UN INCREDULO ME TILDE DE LOCO! Tenía tanta furia que a Moore se le empezó a quemar la piel y se le caía, pero en vez de que se viera la carne, un reptiloide de 3,50 metros salió del interior. -¡¿Como hiciste eso?!- dijo el reptiloide- Tú debes ser Adam Rolley, el elegido Vivimir Apenas se curó del aturdimiento, el reptiloide se abalanzó sobre mí, pero antes de que me enterrara sus garras, un disparo se dirigió hacia él, dejándolo en el piso. -Sabía que Moore ocultaba algo- dijo una voz desconocida- pero ser un reptiloide, eso es inesperado, de razón el calor infernal y la lava y la profundidad y la arena movediza, soy Scott Kennedy y soy caza-aliens, tú debes ser Adam Rolley, ¿no?. -Sí, ¿cómo lo supiste?- dije intrigado. -La escoria reptiloide lo dijo hace un rato- respondió Scott con naturalidad. -Sí, como digas, Scott, ¿quién exactamente es él?- dije señalando al reptiloide. -Pues... tiene una carta en el traje, veamos que dice. Scott se acercó al reptiloide con cuidado y le cogió la carta del traje, la cual decía: Vivimir: Al parecer no recibiste mi paquete, mis informantes me dicen que un humano lo recibió, pero ese no es el punto, el humano con poderes psíquicos es muy peligroso para nuestro ejército, debes evitar a toda costa que los humanos se alíen con las criaturas míticas, tenemos que aliarnos nosotros: los unicuernos, los licántropos, los pegasos y la criohidra se encuentran en el inexplorado continente ártico; Los centauros y los ent viven en las profundidades de los bosques grandes; los dragones, las aves fénix y los grifos están en las montañas rocosas; las sirenas, los tritones y el kraken viven en las profundidades de los océanos y, finalmente, el basilisco saurio mayor, el pirolisco, la hidra lernaenana, la pirohidra, el cancerbero, la pesadilla y la sombra viven la caverna subterránea de Mammoth cave. -El soberano ¿Vivimir? ¿Así que el reptiloide gigante es Vivimir? Pero, Vivimir otra vez esta cruzado con el soberano, ¿Quién es el soberano?. -Al parecer el reptiloide se llama Vivimir- dijo Scott. -No es solo un reptiloide… él es descendiente sauroide- dije preocupado. -Sí, ese soy yo- dijo Vivimir levantándose del suelo- Y haré lo que sea para liberar a mis antepasados, pero, no voy a charlar con dos humanos, me iré, ¡adiós!. Finalmente, Vivimir se fue de un solo salto. Camino al Bosque Redwire -Justo lo que me temía…- dijo Scott- la conquista reptiloide ocurrirá pronto. - Y eso no es todo- dije con miedo a la reacción de Scott- los reptiloides están aliados con los grises y los dos juntos nos… -Destruirán como a una hormiga- me interrumpió Scott- tenemos que aliarnos con las criaturas míticas, veamos… la carta decía específicamente 5 lugares… Bosques grandes, El Ártico, Mammoth cave, las profundidades oceánicas y las montañas rocosas. -Wow, esos son muchos lugares, y muy lejanos…- dije preocupado. - Veamos… El Ártico está muy lejos… Las profundidades oceánicas son inalcanzables… Las montañas rocosas están lejos de aquí… Mammoth cave está relativamente cerca, pero hay criaturas demoniacas peligrosas si no tenemos tropas… Y el bosque grande más cercano es el Redwire, que queda muy cerca a Washington… ¡Ya se!- exclamó Scott- Ve al bosque Redwire y convence a los centauros y también a los ent. -Ok, lo haré, pero no será sencillo…- dije sintiendo un mal presagio- lo presiento… Yo sabía lo riesgosa que era esa misión, pero no me iba a detener por eso, me di la vuelta y vi un tubo largo que llevaba hasta la superficie, así que me metí en él y ascendí rápidamente a tierra firme. -Desde acá se puede ver el bosque Redwire- dije examinando las montañas- serán aproximadamente unos 30 minutos. Mi auto estaba sin gasolina y lo fui a llenar, pero en la gasolinera más cercana había muchos carros que tenían gente que se cubría toda con trajes y capuchas negras. -Qué raro- dije- nunca vi personas así… Así que me fui a otra gasolinera, que quedaba un poco más lejos y ahí vi que el señor que me estaba atendiendo, tenía una cara conocida. -Buenos días, señor- dijo el empleado- ¿cuánto le pongo?. -Cincuenta por favor- dije pensando. -Con mucho gusto- dijo él- empezamos en ceros. El empleado abrió la puertecita y sonó un clic, el cual dije que era la manguera. -Adiós, señor- dije después de recargarse el tanque. - Introducta GPS, deus - le escuché decir al señor. El Bosque Redwire Conforme me acercaba al bosque, sentía punzadas en el estomago. Desde Washington, el bosque parecía como cualquier otro, pero desde la carretera, se veía oscuro y tenebroso. -Qué extraño que no haya una entrada al bosque o un carro en 50 metros a la redonda- dije pensando en los otros bosques como el Yellowstone, el Blackrock y el Stonesand- Hmmmm… me va a tocar dejar el carro acá en la carretera. Así que dejé mi carro al lado del bosque, para que yo pueda alcanzarlo si me toca huir. El bosque estaba muy oscuro y me tocó entrar por una apertura que había entre dos árboles. Los ruidos del Redwire eran escalofriantes, sonaban cosas como serpientes, pisadas, y creo haber escuchado también un caballo galopando, pero nada de eso estaba ahí. Cada vez que el bosque se hacía más oscuro, se oían menos ruidos y se incrementaba algo que causaba aún más miedo, el silencio. - Vete de aquí… - me decía el viento en un tono amenazador- Vete de aquí… Estás en peligro… Te encontrarás con ellos… Cuando el silencio se hizo total, escuché un galopar rápido, y una sombra pasó delante de mis ojos, me comencé a asustar más al escuchar el crujir de ramas secas como si estuvieran moviéndose hacía mi. -¿Quién eres y que quieres?- dijo una voz desconocida apuntándome con una flecha. -Soy Adam Rolley, vengo a buscar a los centauros y a los Ent. -¿Qué quieres de nosotros?- dijo él. -Quiero que se alíen con los humanos- dije seguro. -¿Aliarnos? ¿Para qué?- dijo él extrañado. -Para la guerra, los reptiloides vienen a atacarnos y necesitamos de ustedes- dije informándolo- ayúdenos, es nuestro mundo. -Está bien…- dijo él- también le informaremos a las criaturas del ártico. -Muchas gracias- dije- a propósito, ¿Cuál es tu nombre?. -Soy Nwarb, y soy el líder de los centauros. El encuentro cercano Mientras me llevaba a la salida, Nwarb me contaba historias impactantes de cómo sus antepasados habían sido derrotados y marginados por los humanos del pasado, como 3112 años aproximadamente. -Los humanos del pasado eran muy crueles e ignorantes al parecer, ¿no?- dije pensando en cómo fueron ellos capaces de hacer eso. -Sí, lo fueron, pero los aliens son otra historia, los humanos nos atacaban porque nosotros los invadíamos, por otro lado, los aliens solo se aprovechaban de nosotros y de ellos para conseguir esclavizar nuestro mundo, pero nosotros no nos dejamos y los echamos, ellos mataban a muchos sin razón alguna. -Que crueles, y ahora que tienen aliados, planean vengarse de nosotros, pobres débiles…- dije sintiéndome decepcionado de ellos. Cuando Nwarb me dejó al lado de mi auto, me despedí de él y me dijo que iba a hablar también con los del Ártico, los de las montañas y los de los océanos. -Nosotros no somos débiles- dijo una voz conocida- y se que estuviste aliándote con las criaturas, leíste mi carta y así lo previniste, eres más listo de lo que pensé, pero si sigues haciéndote el listillo, vas a terminar como un alma atrapada, ¿sabes?. -Así que al fin nos conocemos bien, Vivimir- dije mirándolo a la cara, la cual quedaba muy alta, el reptiloide parecía un dinosaurio humanoide de 3,30 metros- mira, esta es la primera vez que te hablo pero te advierto que no voy a permitir ni que liberes a tus parientes sauroides ni que destruyas la tierra. -Sabes, hasta ahora te conozco bien pero ya me pareces un adversario débil e incapaz- dijo con intenciones de provocarme y atacarlo- no vales la pena, puedes tener el poder gris más poderoso pero no eres más que un enclenque. Esa palabra fue la gota que colmó el vaso, me había provocado, lo único que vi fue a un reptiloide volando lejos de mí, no podía creer que lo había hecho, pero no todo era felicidad y orgullo, inmediatamente se recuperó del aturdimiento, el reptiloide se levanto y se vino corriendo contra mí, pero cuando se acercó, una flecha con punta de acero se le clavó en la espalda y la punta lo atravesó hasta su pecho. -Te dije que te defendería de todo alien que te atacara- dijo Nwarb con su arco de Madera de Beth, un árbol sagrado de Europa. Mammoth Cave Vívimir se retiró la flecha del pecho y me intento atacar pero miles de criaturas lo amenazaron: centauros, ent, licántropos, dragones, aves fénix, etc. -No te atacaré- dijo Vivimir- ya hice lo que quería, la guerra ha comenzado, mis compañeros reptiloides se enterarán de esto e invadirán la tierra pronto. Y así, el reptiloide se fue de un solo salto y se desapareció en el cielo. -Tranquilo- dijo Nwarb- su amenaza no es tan grave, nos tienes a nosotros, ¿ahora que hacemos?, dinos. -Bueno… ahora tenemos que ir al peor lugar de todos… Mammoth cave- solo los reptiloides saben qué criaturas hay ahí. -¿Y como sabremos a que enfrentarnos?- preguntó Nwarb. -Pues, mira, hace poco, confiscamos una carta reptiloide que decía que en Mammoth Cave hay: el basilisco saurio mayor, el pirolisco, la hidra lernaenana, la pirohidra, el cancerbero, la pesadilla y la sombra. -Wow, esas son muchas criaturas demoniacas, ¿podremos lidiar con ellas?- preguntó Nwarb. Al llegar a Mammoth Cave, una brisa tenue pero fría nos azotó a todos, pero apenas al entrar, nos percatamos de que había unas galerías subterráneas, como si alguien ya las hubiera cavado. Después de cruzar la primera galería, oímos un rugido, un rugido que hizo temblar todo, habíamos llegado a una especie de cámara gigante y poco iluminada, de repente la cámara se iluminó y miles de criaturas infernales se percataron de que estábamos allí. -¿Que hacen aquí?- dijo la pesadilla. -Venimos por ayuda- dije temeroso. -¿Ayuda?, ¿para qué?- dijo la pesadilla extrañado. -Invasión reptiloide- dije seguro. -Lo que me temía- dijo- te ayudaremos, pero antes tendrás que superar una prueba. -Lo que sea- dije haciéndome el valiente. -¿Has visto alguna vez a un reptiloide?- me preguntó la pesadilla. -¿En serio? Que prueba tan fácil, si,sí he visto a un reptiloide- dije suponiendo. -Ahhh, ¿Si?, a este tal vez- dijo, y un fantasma de Vivimir llegó a la cámara así que le lancé una honda psíquica y lo desaparecí. La guerra ha comenzado Al llegar a Washington, lo único que vi fueron ruinas, edificios en llamas y derrumbados, casas totalmente colapsadas, pero lo más impresionante era un hueco gigante y hondo que había en el centro de la ciudad. -Esos reptiles lo pagarán caro- dijo Scott- mi padre casi no sale ileso, una pared le cayó encima pero él hizo lo del triangulo de vida. -¿Tu padre?- pregunté confuso. -Sí, mi padre, el teniente Kennedy, ¿no has oído hablar de él?- me dijo Scott. El teniente Kennedy era un héroe para Norteamérica, hace 40 años, en Roswell ubicado en Nuevo México, 7 de julio de 1973, un OVNI gris se estrelló en un rancho, cerca de Corona y un grupo de militares lo rodeo y llevó a sus tripulantes grises al Área 51 en Nevada. -Buen día muchacho- dijo el Teniente Kennedy. -¿Teniente Kennedy, es usted?- pregunte maravillado. -Sí, soy yo, usted debe ser Rolley, ¿No?- dijo el teniente- me dicen que usted es el elegido para derrotar al sauroide, ¿no?. -Sí señor, ese soy yo, pero aún no he descubierto como derrotarlo- dije avergonzado. -No tiene que investigar ni descubrir- dijo el Teniente Kennedy- señor Rolley, el poder está en usted, no busque mas, ahí lo tiene. -Gracias, señor Kennedy, perdón, señor teniente Kennedy- corregí rápidamente. Escuchamos un radio que estaba bajo los escombros y rápidamente lo cogimos, el radio estaba todo polvoriento pero aún así decía: - Auxilio, auxilio, los alienígenas están atacando Nueva York… Auxilio, auxiliooooo - gritaba el locutor, pero de repente sonó como si se hubiera roto el micrófono- tenemos problemas técnicos, por favor manténgase a la espera . -Eso no sonó bien… debemos ir a Nueva York, pero rápido- dijo el teniente Kennedy y Scott me miró. Se montaron en un auto y me dijeron que me concentrara y que canalizara toda mi energía, al final lancé una honda sónica tan fuerte que nos llevó disparados a los tres a Nueva York en 5 minutos. -Tenemos que salvar la ciudad- dijo Scott. -Esto es la guerra-dijo el teniente Kennedy. Dracob -Desplieguen a los unicuernos- dijo el Teniente Kennedy y los unicuernos salieron galopando hacia los aliens, matando a miles. -Padre, no los trates como si fueran animales salvajes, ellos tienen pensamiento libre- le replicó Scott. -Está bien- dijo el teniente Kennedy- necesito un arma… y un ejército… -Ejercito anti-aliens del sector de Nueva York a su servicio, señor Kennedy- dijeron un grupo de militares. -Ataquen a los invasores del sector 9- dijo Kennedy dirigiéndose a un grupo- ustedes vayan al sector 8 - dijo dirigiéndose a otro grupo y así sucesivamente hasta llegar al sector 1. El teniente Kennedy me dijo que buscara a Vivimir y que lo eliminara si podía. Nunca había visto algo así, miles de cadáveres grises y reptilianos, pero también cadáveres de centauros, de ents, de todo. De repente, un disparo me dio en el brazo, desintegrándomelo internamente. Un reptiloide me había disparado en él, el reptiloide al darse cuenta de quién era yo, salió corriendo pero yo lo alcancé psíquicamente con el otro brazo y lo lancé. -Rolley, ¿está bien?- dijo el teniente Kennedy- Tome esto, es el simillimum, aplíqueselo en el brazo y se le curará instantáneamente- me lanzó un frasco- ¡Cuidadoooo! En ese momento, un saurio-reptiloide de 10 metros y medio cayó del cielo. Iba adornado con una capa gigante y una túnica con incrustaciones de oro y diamante. Tenía también un par de alas gigantes de color rojo. -Vivimir- dije entre dientes apretando el puñal de mi armamento. -Yo no soy Vivimir- dijo él- permítanme presentarme, soy el soberano o si quieren, llámenme Dracob, y si se preguntan porque las alas, les contaré, resulta que yo soy el único draconiano existente. -¿Draconianos?- pregunté intrigado. -Sí, los draconianos son un cruce entre dragones y reptiloides- dijo él- el resto fue eliminado por mí. -¿Eliminaste a los de tu raza?- pregunté temeroso- ¿Cómo fuiste capaz de hacer eso?. -Eran débiles, no servían ni para ejército- dijo con naturalidad y desprecio- no me gustan los débiles. La hidra lernaenana De repente, una criatura de 13 metros y 10 cabezas surgió del piso, la hidra lernaenana había llegado justo a tiempo para vencer al draconiano. -¡SE UNIERON CON LAS HIDRAS!. Esto sí es guerra-exclamó Dracob. El draconiano se dio la vuelta y encontró a un enemigo muy poderoso, la hidra lernaenana era una de las 3 hidras; poseía increíble fuerza y lo mejor, cada vez que se la cortaba una cabeza, se regeneraba. Pero Dracob sacó le espada sagrada, una espada a la cual solo se le puede sacar si se es el ser más poderoso del planeta Draconia. Dracob le cortó una cabeza a la hidra, pero inmediatamente se le volvió a crecer. -¡¿Cómo es eso posible?!- dijo Dracob. El draconiano se dispuso a cortar todas y cada una de las cabezas de la hidra, pero siempre se regeneraban, la hidra lo agarró con una de sus cabezas y lo lanzó lejos, pero Dracob frenó el vuelo con sus alas y le lanzó su espada a la hidra, dándole en el nacimiento de una cabeza y cortándola definitivamente. -No puede ser- le dije a Scott- ¿le…le…le…le ha cortado una cabe…ca…cabeza?. -Sí- me dijo Scott- la única forma de cortarle definitivamente una cabeza a la hidra, es cortándosela desde el punto de nacimiento, es decir donde el cuello se une con el pecho, solo así se le puede cortar. -Ya entendí- dije- entonces por eso no le cortaba la cabeza cuando le tiraba a la mitad del cuello, ¿no?, no le estaba tirando al nacimiento. Mientras hablábamos, el draconiano estaba herido e el piso y a la hidra le faltaban 2 cabezas, pronto nos dimos cuenta que Dracob se había enterado de la forma para cortarle las cabezas, el draconiano se levantó y se abalanzó con su espada sobre la hidra, poco a poco le fue cortando las cabezas, aunque la hidra también lo mordía, rasguñaba y lo hacía volar. Al final, cuando el draconiano le cortó la ultima cabeza, toda la hidra y sus restos se hicieron piedra y se pulverizaron. -Esto no puede ser posible- dije asombrado. -Lo es, pero también es muy malo- dijo Scott. Pyro Pero no todo era victoria y celebración para Dracob, no, poco tiempo después, del cielo, vino volando la pyrohidra, era una hidra de una cabeza, la cual lanzaba fuego y era muy resistente, casi intocable, solo la espada más poderosa, el mejor filo, y el usuario más fuerte podían cortarla. Cuenta la leyenda que hace mucho tiempo en Esparta, Grecia, una hidra y un dragón tuvieron un hijo, una hidra con cuerpo, alas y fuego de un dragón, pero con el poder, dientes, garras y habilidades de una hidra, era muy poderosa, un día, esa hidra salió de su caverna y se fue a la ciudad de Esparta, allá todo se veía normal, los guerreros, el pueblo, todo, pero cuanto la hidra entró a la ciudad, todos en ella empezaron a gritar, lo cual alertó a los guardias y fueron a enfrentarse al monstruo y le lanzaban espadas, lanzas, de todo, pero nada penetraba en sus duras escamas, eso solo asustaba a la hidra, la cual lanzaba fuego, movía la cola y volaba a todas partes. Al final, la hidra fue a su caverna y los espartanos la bautizaron como Pyro, palabra griega que significa literalmente fuego, Pyro se multiplicó y al haber tantos Pyros, los bautizaron como pyrohidras, actualmente solo sobrevive una pyrohidra, el Pyro original. -La pyrohidra, ¿ehhh?- dijo Dracob dirigiéndose a mí- le tengo mucha ventaja, para tu información, vivo en un planeta con temperaturas muy altas, con lava y mis escamas me hacen prácticamente inmune al fuego. Lo que no sabía Dracob era que la cabeza de Pyro era literalmente casi indestructible. El draconiano se dispuso a intentar cortarle la cabeza y lo único que le lograba hacer era sacarle chispas como si estuviera golpeando a un metal duro como el hormigón o algo parecido. -Pero… la otra hidra la derroté así… ¿por qué no le puedo cortar la cabeza?- se preguntó Dracob. Pyro le lanzó un fuego tan poderoso y tan intenso que hizo volar al draconiano. El draconiano recordó que Pyro no solo era una hidra si no que también era un dragón, y Dracob el cual era parte dragón también, sabía los puntos débiles de los dragones. El draconiano hizo una combinación de movimientos muy efectiva, ataco primero a una debilidad, los ojos, dejándolo ciego, después le enterró las garras dentro de la boca, en el órgano de fuego y finalmente, como golpe final, le enterró la espada en el estomago, la única parte débil externa de un dragón, Pyro estalló en fuego y sus restos se quemaron totalmente. La criohidra y el basilisco La última hidra era la más fuerte y la más grande de todas, y no venía sola, el basilisco saurio mayor la acompañaba. La criohidra era de la familia de las hidras, pero a diferencia de sus hermanas, ella salía en el agua, medía aproximadamente 30 metros y congelaba todo lo que tocaba, dice la leyenda que una hidra lernaenana, cansada de que la atacaran los griegos, se sumergió en el agua y se reprodujo allí, uno de sus hijos era un pulpo gigante, los griegos lo llamaron Kraken, el Kraken se reprodujo y dos de los bebes se dirigieron a las aguas más frías, las del Ártico, allí, las tormentas de nieve y los congelamientos repentinos obligaron a los 2 Krakens a cambiar el tono de escamas y a cazar otros animales. Los Krakens se subieron a tierra y sus tentáculos fueron reemplazados por patas y la cabeza se les alargó, creando así la criohidra. -Esta vez son dos, ¿ehhh?- dijo Dracob. Dracob procedió a atacar a las dos criaturas, pero el basilisco se metió en la tierra así que prácticamente, Dracob solo le tocó luchar contra la criohidra. La criohidra le lanzó un aliento congelante, pero Dracob lo esquivó y la criohidra lo remató con un golpe con la cola y lo derribó del aire. Dracob le lanzó la espada, pero esta solo logró hacerle un pequeño rasguño a la criohidra, lo cual la hizo enfurecer. La criohidra tomó una posición agresiva y agarró al draconiano por el cuerpo y lo mordió, los diamantes y el oro de la capa se congelaron y se rompieron totalmente. La criohidra lanzó al draconiano lejos, pero el draconiano no se rindió y fue, con sus últimos alientos, a intentar derrotarla, pero la hidra lo congeló. De repente el suelo comenzó a temblar y lo siguiente que vi fue al basilisco saltar del suelo y comerse al draconiano. El basilisco y la criohidra se fueron, sumergiéndose en el agua. Resumen de 8 años Los siguientes años fueron solo guerra y ataques. Por ejemplo, el 30 de abril del 2013, los aliens atentaron contra la ciudad de Texas, lo cual desató una batalla colosal. El 15 de agosto del 2014, los aliens atacaron al estado de Nuevo México, exactamente el pueblo de Roswell, donde cayó el OVNI hacia más de 20 años. Las batallas eran muchas y muy poderosas. Pero en el 2015, después de la destrucción de más de 150 ciudades y pueblos estadounidenses, los jefes y yo decidimos hacer una junta en un refugio bajo tierra. -¡Esto no puede seguir pasando!- dijo Scott- ¡No podemos dejar que se sigan perdiendo vidas y ciudades por unos reptiloides y unos grises!. -¿Qué podemos hacer al respecto?- preguntó Nwarb- ¡ellos son muy fuertes!. -Pues…- dije yo- siempre podemos pensar en hacer algún tipo de estrategia, ¿no?. -¿Una estrategia?- dijo Scott- es una buena idea. -No lo es- dijo Nwarb- ellos son muy inteligentes y poderosos, además los grises pueden leer mentes y prevenir el futuro, es difícil. -Me refiero, los aliens han atacado a las ciudades estratégicamente, ¿no?- dije- podemos prevenir su próximo ataque, veamos… será en Nevada. En los siguientes años continuamos con la misma estrategia y la llamamos la \"PVW\" por sus siglas en ingles. Los siguientes ataques fueron menos duros y menos poderosos gracias a la \"PVW\". Finalmente, en el año 2018, los reptiloides y los grises descubrieron que nuestro plan \"PVW\" era la forma de evitar la destrucción total de las ciudades y frustraron nuestra estrategia atacando sin una secuencia u orden alguno, al final, los aliens atacaron a California, mi ciudad. La batalla final: Adam vs Vivimir -¡¿DONDE ESTAS, COBARDE?!- grité enfurecido- ¡VEN ACÁ Y PELEA!. Vivimir me atacó por detrás, dándome un golpe muy fuerte, yo tenía tanta furia que no sentí el dolor y lancé al reptiloide a un edificio en llamas, pero antes de que se fuera, el reptiloide me agarró y me fui con él. -¿Acaso te creías más fuerte y listo que yo?- dijo Vivimir- pues fallaste, soy un sauroide, si no te acuerdas, tengo muchas y muy poderosas técnicas de combate, más poderosas que las tuyas. -Sí, pero olvidas que tengo poderes psíquicos- dije desafiante. Casi al instante, saqué el cuchillo de mi armamento y se lo lancé, obviamente y como lo planeé, el reptiloide lo esquivó. -¿Creías que me ibas a hacer daño con un simple cuchillo?- dijo Vivimir en tono burlesco- que risa, con un cuchillo. -Sabes algo, burlón, deberías mirar para atrás- dije riéndome. El cuchillo lo atravesó, resulta que como Vivimir esquivó el cuchillo, yo utilicé mis poderes psíquicos e hice devolver el cuchillo, logrando así, atravesar al reptiloide. -Buena jugada, niño- dijo Vivimir, retirándose el cuchillo del pecho. -Nunca me retes- dije con un tono amenazador. El piso del edificio comenzó a temblar y las llamas lo invadieron. -Tengo que salir de aquí antes de que esto…-dije siendo interrumpido por el derrumbe de ese piso- no puedo creer que siga vivo. -No por mucho tiempo- dijo el reptiloide. Apenas se levantó, Vívimir se abalanzó contra mí, lanzándonos a los dos por una ventana del edificio. -¿Estas enterado de que caemos de una gran altura?- dije asustado. -Sí, lo estoy, en el aire son mejores las peleas- dijo él. Vivimir dio la vuelta y me puso a mí abajo, de espaldas al suelo, pero yo no me dejé y con mis poderes psíquicos lo deje de espaldas y lo mantuve así. Finalmente, cuando caímos, había un cuerpo inerte de reptiloide en el suelo. FIN EPÍLOGO: Al llegar a donde estaban Scott, Nwarb, el teniente Kennedy y los demás, les dije que todo había terminado, que Vivimir había sido derrotado y ellos a su vez me dijeron que la ultima nave reptiloide y gris había sido derribada, que habíamos ganado, que sobreviviríamos, también me dijeron que vieron un rayo horizontal que partió el firmamento en dos, que todos lo miraron, pero lo más curioso, que habían visto uno igual en la primera batalla, pero más importante, que sobreviviríamos.

Yes, of course...but does it look bad? The doctor will be out as soon as he can... George reluctantly went out to the waiting area. Suddenly he felt all alone and very afraid. He looked around the waiting area and saw a payphone in the corner. \"I should call Susan and tell her about Matt...after all she also considers Matthew to be a great friend as well.\" He then walked over to the phone, put some money in and dialed the house. George heard two rings, then the sound of the receiver on the other end being picked up. \"Hello?\" George began speaking in Tenctonese to Susan. \"Susan…Matt's been hurt badly. Susan…I...I…\" George sniffled. \"Neemu, I'll be there in a few minutes...Buck took the car to take Emily to the store for some lizard tails, but as soon as they return, I'll be there.\" George hung up the payphone and sat down in a chair. A few minutes passed, and Susan arrived at the hospital to find George sitting in a chair looking extremely worried. She walked up to him and gave him the touch. \"Neemu?\" George looked up at her. \"I...haven't heard anything. He wanted breakfast, but I made him practice baseball. I don't know…Susan?\" Susan sat in the chair next to George. \"What happened, Neemu?\" \"We had gotten a call about a robbery. The perpetrator, who had been robbing convenience stores, had struck the one on the corner of Tyrone Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard. We left the baseball field and headed to the location. When we got there, we found out that the perpetrator had gassed the store, and the only police presence was the officer who radioed in the call. Matt decided to cover the back entrance while I went in the front. So he took his gas mask and went around the building. I went inside, and didn't see the perpetrator, so I headed out the back door to help Matthew because I thought Matt had caught him.\" Recalling the events of the last hour caused George to shiver. \"I opened the door, looked around, and didn't see or hear anything. I started to reach for the radio to call Matt when...\" George stopped, and inhaled deeply. \"Susan…he was lying on the ground. Unconscious. Susan, when I knelt down next to him, he-he-didn't have a pulse. I started CPR on him, and I yelled at the officer to call an ambulance. After a few minutes, I felt a weak pulse and he was still breathing weakly, but he was still unconscious. The ambulance and the paramedics came not long after that, and loaded him into the ambulance. They let me ride with them after I told them that I was his partner and that I would stay out of their way.\" George shivered again. \"He stopped breathing as the ambulance pulled into the hospital parking lot. I wanted to stay in the examination room with him, but the nurse pulled me out as the heart monitor alarm went off.\" \"Susan...what...what if he dies?\" \"Neemu...you mustn't think like that!\" Susan reached over and took her husband's hand in hers. \"Remember...Matthew is in good health-for a human.\" Susan tightened her grip on George's hand. \"But, we can pray to Celene and Andarko.\" \"George…maybe you should give Cathy a call. Just to let her know what happened.\" George nodded, briefly touched his wife's temple, and went over to the phones. He dialed Cathy's phone number. After a brief ring, the other end of the line was picked up. \"Dr. Frankel.\" \"Cathy…it's George.\" \"Oh, hi George…what can I do for you?\" \"Cathy…it's Matt. He's over here at Valley Hospital. Cathy, I think he may have been seriously injured.\" There was an audible gasp on the other end of the line. \"George…I'll be over there as soon as possible.\" George replaced the receiver, and went to sit next to his wife. He noticed that Susan was holding a white cloth in her lap. \"Neemu...I brought this along. I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to say a prayer.\" Susan offered her husband a small smile. George responded by giving his wife the touch, then pulling the prayer cloth so that it covered his and Susan's laps. George exhaled, closed his eyes, and began to pray to Celine and Andarko. He was so deep in prayer, that he almost didn't notice when Cathy arrived. He opened his eyes only to look up into the face of one very worried Cathy. He told Cathy, \"Hello. We've heard nothing.\" Cathy looked down at the floor and asked softly, \"May I pray with you?\" Susan reached out for Cathy and gave a small, but sweet smile. \"I think Matthew would like that.\" She gently pulled Cathy into the chair next to her and gave her a bit of the prayer cloth. The three of them then began to pray for their friend. George looked up from his prayers when he heard the sound of the doctor's voice approaching. He then pushed the prayer blanket aside when he saw Captain Grazier walking alongside the doctor, and walked out into the hallway. Susan and Cathy followed him, but stopped a few feet away from the three men. George approached the doctor and Captain Grazier. \"How is Matthew?\" The doctor turned towards George. \"I'm sorry detective...we did all we could, but we were unable to revive Mr. Sikes.\" George heard a sharp gasp behind him, as he suddenly felt his world crumble around him. He felt the doctor's hand on his shoulder and Grazier's grip on his arm. He barely heard the doctor when he said that Matthew hadn't felt any pain. George turned away from the doctor and slowly began walking towards Susan and Cathy. He said to them in their native Tenctonese, \"We've lost him.\" ","Summary":" Missing Scene: Rebirth I'm sorry Detective, but you're going to have to wait in the corridor.

This story is fornentertainment purposes only. No copyright infringement intended. Buck rolled over in his bed. He could have sworn he'd heard hisnmother's voice, but all was silent in his room at the Francisconresidence. Just as well, he decided. Late night last night… \"Buck! Breakfast is ready, come get your weasel.\" Came hisnmothers voice from the bottom of the stairs. Damn, just as I thought I was off the hook… He got up out of bed, reached for the jeans he'd thrown haphazardlynonto the floor the night before, and began to put them on. He hadnreached down to try to fasten them before he'd realised that he'dnput them on back to front. He groaned, rubbed his eyes, and resolvednto try it once more. \"Buck, your bats blood's getting cold!\" He heard his mothernagain. \"Coming mom!\" He lifted his left foot in an attempt to put socksnon, while holding the other one between his teeth. \"Buck!\" His mother snapped, clearly loosing patience with hernson. \"Coming mom.\" He muffled through the sock, unfortunately verynlittle sound escaped his lips. His leg still up in the air, he wasnreaching his bedroom door to try to open it when unsurprisingly henlost his balance. He went from standing one legged with an arm in thenair, to sitting in a heap on the floor in one loud crash. \"Buck, what was that noise?\" Came the voice of his father,nGeorge. Buck sighed, It looked like today was going to be anothernlousy day. \" All right Cadets! That was pitiful god damnit, is this all wengot out of our new recruits! Come on boys, grow a pair! Put somenmuscle behind it, climb!\" Buck, one of eight male cadets, raced as fast as he could up thenrope wall, when his foot got caught on the last \"step\" and henfell. Unfortunately when he fell, his foot remained firmly entrenchednin the rope, and so he hung there, for all to see. \" Easy going Francisco, you'll break something!\" The officernyelled. The other cadets took this as an opportunity to laugh at him.nOnce again, he found himself subject to their taunts. \" Leave it out men! You've made bigger idiots of yourselves!\"nBuck knew the instant those words left the Officer's mouth, thatnthey were going to come back to haunt him. Buck flinched, remembering the prelude to yesterday's events. Henbrought his hand up to touch his swollen eye and grimaced. His mothernand father would most likely want to know what happened, and ofncourse his father --Being a police officer-- Would insist on marchingnright over to the academy to sort it all out. After that, he'dnmostly likely lose the last smidgen of respect his fellow studentsnhad for him, and be meeting an early grave. \"Oh my goodness your eye!\" Susan Francisco went pale as her sonnentered the kitchen. She put down her coffee and was immediately atnhis side. \"Oh, Finiksa, what happened to you?\" Buck tried tonsmile at the concerned faces of his family, before he settled at thenkitchen table and began to eat. \"I'm alright mom, just a joke, some of the other cadets, younknow.\" He began to eat, ignoring the completely unconvinced staresnfrom his family. His sister was the first to speak. \"Well it was some joke, Buck!\" \"Just leave it Em'\" He pleaded with her. Knowing hownopinionated his sister was, he knew it would take some doing on hernpart. \"Well this is outrageous!\" Began his father, Detective GeorgenFrancisco. Here it comes. \"I demand that something be done about this! Susan, this isnappalling.\" George Francisco turned to face his wife expectantly. \"Well I agree George, but what does Buck want to do?\" Shenreplied. Suddenly all eyes were on him again. He looked back at them, mouthnfull of food, and shook his head as he swallowed. \"Nothing\" he replied, and loaded up his fork with anothernmouthful of weasel. \"I don't know what to do Matthew. Buck is adamant that he doesn'tnwant to do anything, but he is my child. I am a father, who's sonnis being persecuted and prejudiced against and I am powerless.\"nGeorge Francisco slammed his fist down on the desk he shared withnpartner, Matt Sikes. \"George, sometimes you just gotta let your kids strike out on theirnown. Let him deal with his own problems.\" Replied his partner fromnacross the desk, while holding a half eaten, half melted candy bar.nHe looked at it and sighed, \"Geez, when are they gonna invent airncon for your desk drawer?\" George sighed. \"I wish you would take this seriously Matthew.\" \"George, I always take it seriously when you call me 'Matthew.'\" \" Matt, this is not a joke. I am asking you, my friend, fornadvice regarding my son. You are a father. What would you do in myncircumstance?\" Sikes sighed. The precinct was quiet today, Grazer was in a goodnmood, and all around him, the officers and detectives seemed to benfull of cheer. He should have known George would walk in frowning. \"George, I know this is difficult for you. Believe me, I don'tnparticularly like the idea that this stuff is still going on withinnour police academy. The thing is George, Buck said he didn't wantnyou to do anything, and he's an adult, he has his own life.\" \"Buck is comparatively young by Tencotonese standards.\" \"Look, bottom line is, things haven't always been plain sailingnwith you and Buck, and you don't wanna push him away George. If younreally want to do something, do something. Just do it carefully, andnbe honest with Buck.\" George looked around the room, at the officers at their desks, atnAlbert Einstein -the binnaum to his children, and janitor to thenprecinct- quietly mopping the floors. George watched him as henoccasionally glanced over at his pregnant wife, May, who as usual wasnbusy with her cart, providing beverages to the officers and workersnat the precinct. He felt somewhat annoyed that everyone was busy just getting on withnthings when he felt, simply lost. \"Well Matthew I can't stand it anymore, I am going to contact thenacademy.\" \" Hey slag, looks like you got Ellen on your side.\" Buck lookednup from the bench. The male locker room at the academy had suddenlynbecome a little crowded. The other seven cadets from the trainingnexercise earlier looked back at him. He didn't know what to say. \" Aren't you gonna answer us slag?\" The one whom had spoken anmoment ago asked. \" What do you want me to say?\" Asked Buck. \" Well haven't you got something to say for yourself Francisco,nthink your better than us 'cause your Daddy's a detective? Younknow he only got were he was 'cause they had to put annewcomer on the detective program.\" \" My Dad worked for everything he's got. I'm going to do thensame, I don't need anyone on my side.\" \" That so, huh Slag? No one. Well that works out then doesn'tnit, 'cause we're gonna make sure you've got no one. From nownon, your on your own. Buck couldn't stop thinking of the events of the previous day, andnas he drove to the academy, a sense of dread started forming in thenpit of his stomach. Maybe I shouldn't even bother. He stiffened up, filled with resolve, he carried on driving, henwasn't going to let them ruin his future. George Francisco, filled with resolve, stormed into the LAPD academyngrounds. He stormed past cadets, he stormed past instructors, henpushed his way through crowds. George Francisco didn't stop untilnhe reached reception. \"Where is Lieutenant Ellen's office?\" He asked the secretary. The short human woman looked back at him and her face stiffened asnshe said; \"He's in a meeting.\" \"Well I need to speak to him immediately. Regarding my son.\" \"Well he's busy, wait in the lobby.\" Her voice sounded nasal,nand muffled as she chewed on gum. \"I am Detective George Francisco. I am here regarding my son, BucknFrancisco. I am here regarding the black eye he came home with lastnnight. I want to speak to Ellen, now!\" He raised his voice, and thensecretary leaned forward, put her hands on the desk, and stood. Shenbegan to speak, \"Sir, shut up or I'll call security.\" \"Its alright Anita.\" Came a voice from behind George. He turnednaround to see the face of the man he'd been looking for. Ellen'snsmiled at him, and gestured towards his office. Buck walked into the academy locker room and made his way to hisnlocker, where he pulled out a uniform and boots and began to changeninto his grey police academy t-shirt and black trousers, and overnthem, his black academy jacket. Buck frowned even deeply than he had before, as he suddenly feltnhimself racked with guilt, he ran his hands down the uniform jacketnhe was wearing, a spare. He thought about yesterday's events, untilnhe heard sounds from behind the door that soon knocked him out of hisnreverie. He heard the door creak, as it opened and another cadet walkednthrough, he looked at Buck, with a smirk on his face. \"Francisco, bet you wont be sharing your lunch with anyone today.\"nThe cadet passed through without another word. Buck sat on his seat,nand allowed himself to wonder whether this was really worth it all.nOnce again he steeled himself for another day, and still didn'tnknow what to expect as he stood up to leave for his first class. \"… I understand what your saying Mr. Francisco, and believe me,nwe don't advocate this kind of behaviour. We are doing our best tonprotect newcomer students from this kind of treatment. The incidentnwith your son will be dealt with as soon as possible.\" George huffed, and looked at Lieutenant Ellen. \"With all do respectnMr Ellen, I don't think you are taking this seriously.\" \"Detective, we don't even know what happened yet, just that therenwas an altercation and Buck was involved\" \"Do you intend to punish the ones responsible?\" \"We don't even know for sure I've we've got the rightnpeople…\" Ellen looked at George. He knew that George knew as well as he didnthat punishment for this kind of infraction was dismissal from thenacademy. George waited for a response. \"Mr Francisco, these boys have a bright future ahead of them--\" \"Not good enough! I would like to think my son has a bright futurenalso, although I see that that is a lesser concern to you people.\" \"That is not so!\" \"Then I suggest Mr Ellen, that if you don't want your boysndismissed, you find another way of punishing them, and make sure thatnthey know what will happen to them if they ever do anything like thisnever again.\" George didn't even wait for a response, he simplynstood, and stormed out of the office with as much anger as he enterednit. Buck had waited in the lunch queue for forty five minutes whennthey showed up. He watched as one by one they cut in front of him, asnif he weren't there, and still he did nothing but feel annoyed. \" Ugh,\" One of them began, \"putting slag food with ours,nthat's disgusting.\" Buck sighed. Loudly. The one who spoke, turned to face him. \" Problem spongehead?\" He levelled his gaze. \" Not at all.\" Buck didn't bite. Unwilling to purposelynexacerbate the situation himself. He waited for his fellow cadet'snresponse. \" Then shut up, spongehead.\" The other cadet snarled as hensnapped back at him. Again, Buck allowed the comments to pass, and simply waited in thenline for his turn. Unfortunately he did it feeling absolutelynmiserable. When he'd finally gotten his lunch, he began walking towards annempty table at the back of the cafeteria. He heard a voice. \" Don't sweat it Francisco. They're only mean to ya causenyou're stronger, faster. Goons 'r' just jealous.\" He turnednto the direction of the voice, where he saw a fellow cadet, a youngnhuman woman, whom he couldn't remember the name of. She continued, \" Hey, I mean give yourself cred for still being here, they drovenout most of the other Tenctonese.\" She smiled. \" Thanks… Ah?\" She smiled again, \"Sarah Douglas\" Then she looked back atnBuck, and for a moment looked as if she was going to say something.nBuck looked back at her, and asked \"What?\" \" Nothing, its just, must be sick of getting your…ah, whatevernthat is,\" she looked at his lunch, \"and eating alone, want somencompany?\" Buck felt a little nervous at that, unsure of how his fellownstudents would react to him spending lunch with one of their fellownhumans. Finally he decided to throw caution to the wind, as he took anseat across from her. Buck found that he greatly enjoyed her company and they talked anlot at lunch. He told her about his home and family, about hisnbelief's, his history. He even told her about the incident withnWilliam Campbell five years earlier that led him to change his life. She smiled and laughed at him, and all the while they both ignorednthe smirks and looks they were receiving from the other cadets. Cathy Frankel had been working at the new, joint tenctonese and humannfree clinic, for several weeks now. Well, volunteering was more thenright word. She had started a research position working for then'Institute of Research into Interspecies Reproduction,' but she'dnfound that lending a hand here every now and again, really was quitenfulfilling. They both allowed her to do work that would benefit bothnthe Tenctonese and Humans. Given her relationship with Matt Sikes,nshe felt very strongly about that. She was heading to her nextnpatient, she looked up at the chart on the wall and read 'SarahnDouglas, Human. Bay 2.' Buck was waiting in the academy parking lot as requested. He hadnarranged to meet Cadet Douglas, but she was late. He thought they'dnhit it off, that they could be friends. Now he was beginning to thinknthat the whole thing had been one big joke at his expense. A momentnlater an old, and battered beige Ford Taurus pulled up. Sarah. Buck smiled, relieved. She gestured to him to get in, and he didnso. Once he was beside her in the passenger seat, Sarah began tondrive. \" Where are we going?\" He asked. She smiled a bright smile, andntold him. \" Somewhere quiet.\" \" Somewhere quiet?\" he asked. \" Yeah, just a place I know.\" They pulled up ten minutes later in a secluded area of the localnpark. Buck was a little confused. \" Why are we here?\" He asked. Sarah looked at him, and then looked down towards her knees. For anmoment she didn't say anything at all, until suddenly she liftednher head up and faced forward. Her long wavy black hair fell into hernface, and she moved it with her hand, and reached down with thenother. She pulled up her bag and brought out a small bottle of cheapnvodka. Buck waited. She finally answered. \"Look, Buck there are some things youndon't know about me. Ah, ok the gist is, that I am not particularlynprivileged. I grew up, with purist parents in Slagtown, and being thenonly humans around was pretty tough. Sufficed to say, I hated itnthere, but my parents were no hopers and my mom was a hooker. Theyndidn't care about me. So, I got out on my own and thanks to a cop Inonce knew, got my place at the academy on a scholarship. The othernstudents don't like me, I guess 'cause they grew up differently.nI don't have anywhere that's any kinda home, I sleep at motels ornin my car, and my trunk is full of what little I own.\" She paused,ntook a breath. \"I thought, you know, we could hang out, but I don'tnreally have anywhere to take you except here.\" Buck looked at her, he found that he felt a little sad for her.nMost humans he'd met seemed to think they were all high and mightyncompared to 'slags,' but Sarah seemed to really look down onnherself. Sarah reached over into the back and searched for something. Bucknwatched. She pulled up a milk carton and handed it to him. \"Thisnshould do. I don't have a refrigerator in here so milk is alwaysngoing bad. Drink up Bucko.\" She unscrewed the vodka and took a swig from the bottle. Cathy walked into the cubicle, to see a young woman sat on the bed,nwith what looked like a jacket wrapped round her left arm. \"Hello, my name is Dr. Frankel. What can I do for you?\" She saidnwith a smile as she walked towards her patient. The woman removed the jacket to show Cathy her arm. It had whatnlooked like a large gash on the underside. \"Is that a stab wound?\" Asked Cathy. The woman nodded. \"Well, alright, lets just get that cleaned right up.\" Cathynsmiled as she pulled out dressings and sutures from the supply closetnsituated just on the outside of the bay entrance. The woman jumpedndown from the bed, \"Is there a bathroom I can use Doctor?\" Cathynsmiled again, and directed the woman towards the bathroom. After thenwoman had entered it, Cathy's eyes were drawn to the jacket left onnthe bed. She walked towards it and picked it up, a police academynjacket, it was covered in crimson blood. She turned it over in hernhands and noticed the few drops of pink Tenctonese blood on thencollar as well. She wondered what the story was here, but had noticed that freenclinic patients didn't usually like being interrogated about theirninjuries. As a result, in her time here, she'd learned to not asknquestions. In this case though, she wondered if a crime involving thenpolice had been committed. Why would a young girl be walking aroundnwith a police academy jacket, did she assault a cadet, get stabbednand abscond with the jacket as a makeshift bandage? Cathy put the jacket back on the bed, but as she did so, noticed thenyellow name tag above the academy emblem. She looked at it withnsurprise. \"Francisco\" she said to no one in particular, a quizzical look innher eye. Buck watched his new friend with fascination. They'd beenndrinking for quite sometime and were both quite intoxicated as theynlistened to a radio talk show. \"… So, its because of these dangers, that men and women wishingnto engage in interspecies relations, need to first, have these testsnand take the regulation course, otherwise its quite possible that onenof them --Or both-- Could end up seriously injured…\" The talknseemed to be dealing with the possibilities broached by the IRIR.nSince the institute opened, there had been a lot of talk of human andnnewcomer sexuality in the media, some good, some bad. Then of coursenthere was the Purist response, which had been covered to an equalnextent in the newspapers, and on television. \" I wonder how they do it.\" Sarah said, turning to face hernfriend and taking another swig from the bottle. \" Do what?\" Asked Buck \" You know 'it'\" She stretched her arms out and leaned backninto her chair. \" Oh, humans and newcomers. My Dad's partner lives with anTenctonese woman. Maybe ill ask.\" \" Did they take a course?\" She asked \" Yeah, they did\" Said Buck, before taking another swig of hisnsour milk. \" Bet it was fun.\" She winked at Buck, his eyes widened,nsurprised of the mildly suggestive nature of her talk. He tooknanother swig. And then he told her. \" I kissed a human woman once.\" She looked at him and grinned, \" Really. Now as I understand it, you guys don't do that?\" \" No we don't,\" he explained \"We touch temples to shownaffection, and we don't really rely excessively on close physicalncontact like humans.\" \" So, what was it like?\" She asked, transfixed by thenexperience of her new friend. \" It was just a…A peck, I guess you would call it. Strange…But,nintense, I enjoyed it.\" Buck smiled at the human woman, she smiled back and asked, \"Howndo you touch temples? I've never seen it.\" Buck, perhaps due to their new friendship, perhaps due to the factnthat he felt extremely intoxicated, decided to show her. He took holdnof her wrists, \" Like this,\" He made her hands into fists and touched them tonthe sides of his head. He removed his hands and she held hers on hisntemples. He looked at her and she looked right back. She leaned in towards him, her hands still touching his temples,nher face was within an inch of his, when she said, \" Kiss me.\" ","Summary":" Alien Nation: Series 2 Disclaimer: Alien Nation belongs to Fox.

Jill nodded her understanding, and headed to her house. Emily sat next to her little sister on the steps. \"What's the matter?\" Emily asked. Vessna sighed. \"Emmie...I don't like that school.\" \"What's wrong with Roosevelt Elementary? It's a very good school…I used to go there Vessna.\" \"But Emmie...nobody else in Kindergarten looks like me! All of the other kids in my class are human.\" \"So?\" \"That means I'm different, Emmie.

The two were sitting in a tree in the dark woods. The girl leaned against the tree trunk high among the branches. The boy sat next to her, tapping his fingers against the limb. Branches snapped and leaves crunched all around them, and they knew they were goners. The Xenagons were quick and approaching at a fast rate. The pair both wondered why they even thought it was a good idea to leave the ship in the first place. The planet had been so beautiful. After 7 years of space travel they finally reached the place they've been training to go to their whole life. Who could blame them for being thrilled? Planet Xenonon was everything and more than they were promised. The oxygen levels were strong enough to support human life. Trees grew faster, taller, and stronger than on Earth. Water flowed at an ample rate. Xenonon was the perfect replacement for their dying planet. After years of investigations and probes sent to the planet, the scientists determined it was safe to send humans to it. Little did they know, it was far from safe. Xenagons were far more intelligent than originally proposed. They were smart enough to never let a probe find their hideouts. Smart enough to never let the scientists know that they eat anything that comes in their path. Smart enough to trick the scientists to send their bravest warriors as their first human snack. The second they had arrived on Xenonon, they knew they would have trouble. The Xenagons quickly found their ship and searched the surroundings. They were far scarier in person. Xenagons had dark, scaly skin. They had the same body structure as human, with some minor changes. Their long black tail was pointed at the end, perfect for slicing up their victims. Two strong arms came from each side, and then two legs fit for running long distances. They could walk on two legs or four; it didn't matter to them. Given their six eyes and large nostrils, their hunting abilities were far more than humans were capable of. The left collection of two eyes had the skill to petrify anything that makes eye contact with one. The other four were normal, slightly more enhanced eyes. It's mouth had two rows of sharp, black teeth and a long, blue tongue. Xenagons were truly creatures from hell and below. Mikki and Wes were the first known humans to come into contact with the inhabitants of Planet Xenonon. They were also the first known humans to be completely devoured in front of their six other crewmen by the Xenagons. Mikki and Wes were by far the strongest and most intelligent members of the crew. They had been sent out to take samples of nearby plants and wild life, but were attacked minutes from stepping outside the ship. The Xenagons had hidden in the brush and blended in with their surroundings, waiting until the ship was closed and the two humans were far enough away from it. The crew sat in the ship in horror, watching three beastly Xenagons jump out from the forest and feast upon their life long friends. The crew went into panic after Wes and Mikki were killed. They had to contact the scientists back on Earth and tell them everything, as they were instructed to do once a week or if anything bad occurs. This was a time of crisis in which a call must be made immediately. The six people all gathered in the main room of the ship. After several attempts of contact, they realized their communications were down. The satellites on the roof were busted. They could only assume the Xenagons had broken them, somehow knowing that was one of the most important parts of the ship. The only way to communicate would be to have someone go outside and fix the satellites. After a night of rest and long conversations, two people volunteered to go out. Clyde, the mechanic. He could fix anything in the blink of an eye. He knew this was his job to help successfully contact his home planet. Trinity would be going with him. She was a strong warrior, and very skilled with guns and hand to hand combat. The two would go out together. Clyde would fix the satellites while Trinity protected him from any trouble. She would go with weapons galore, and if it got too bad, they would come in through the emergency hatch in the roof. A foolproof plan, the six thought. What they didn't account for was the Xenagon's speed. Clyde successfully got to the roof and started working. Trinity watched for any attackers. When Clyde was almost done, the Xenagons struck. One jumped down from the trees, tearing Clyde's left arm right from his body. He screamed in agony and fell off the side of the ship, only to have the Xenagon follow him to finish him off. Trinity was fast. She pulled out her gun and shot three bullets into the back of the Xenagon's head as it jumped down. She went to follow it, but heard a strange hissing from behind her and knew she was no longer alone. She turned to see a long, black tail swing at her neck. Trinity had a painless death; the Xenonon version of the guillotine. And just like that, half the crew was down in a matter of two days. Without a way to call the scientists, there was no way home. The ship was programmed by the scientists and only they could control where it traveled. One girl had the genius plan to check other probes to see if they had any ways of communication. Valencia had always been the girl to come up with a plan when all hope was lost. Her idea put light in the crew's hearts again, and they went straight to work. Keegan looked in every manual they had on the ship; sadly, none had the answers. He searched through endless cabinets until he found a book that didn't really seem like it belonged. He read it and to his surprise found a history of every probe sent to the planet. Twenty years before this trip, there was an unspoken journey. One human was sent to the planet, but never made it back. Their ship happened to land only two fields over from where theirs was. Valencia and Keegan decided to venture out in the Orb to see if they could get help. The Orb was a small, circular container on wheels that would act as the crews' car on the rough terrain of Xenonon. The two volunteered to drive to the other ship, send a message to the scientists, and come right back. Two days later Keegan and Valencia were all ready. They each had a rifle and a knife within their reach, and a small gun on their belt. They sat in the car and sealed the doors tight. They turned on their cameras and checked the signal. The two other crewmates, Raelyn and Maxx, sat in control central and watched them in the car. With the cameras, they could see everything that happened. Once they got the thumbs up from Maxx, Valencia and Keegan were off. Their trip was going well. They made it to the ship without seeing any of their beastly foes. They made sure the coast was clear, parked their Orb, and hugged. Keegan decided he would go in first and make sure everything was okay. If not, Valencia would already have the Orb running and he could just hop in. Keegan ran inside and waiting for him was a disgusting ship, overrun by Xenagons. Turns out the creatures were using the ship as a habitat. Keegan barely had time to react before he was torn limb from limb. Valencia screamed. She put the Orb in gear and drove off as fast as she could. When she was almost there, she turned back to see two Xenagons following her. When she looked back, she saw a terrifying sight. A tree was right in front of her, and her Orb crashed into it. She struggled with her seat belt and ran out of the Orb, hoping to make it back to the ship in time. Due to the cameras on the Orb, Maxx and Raelyn saw everything that happened. They ran to the door of the ship and opened it. They went out and we're ready to help Valencia back into the ship when she arrived. Just as she was nearing the ship, a Xenagon grabbed her by the arm. She shot at it with her handy gun, but it was too late. It pulled her back and started to devour her. The other Xenagon continued to race passed them, coming straight for Maxx and Raelyn. The two didn't have time to run back to the ship and close the door in time, so they ran into the dense forest. They hoped the Xenagon's large size would give them an advantage in maneuvering through the woods. The two ran deep into the woods and then stopped at a gigantic tree. They climbed up as far as they could and waited. Now here they sit, waiting in the tree. The two sat silently and listened. They heard the Xenagon approaching fast. Other noises came from all around them; Xenagons by the dozen were roaming the woods, waiting to find them. Raelyn's breath caught in her throat as she saw two Xenagons walk past their tree. She looked at Maxx who had a strange expression on his face. Before she could register his funny face, he sneezed a sneeze that echoed through the whole forest. The Xenagons heads snapped back and ran to the tree. They started shaking it with all there might. Since Maxx was holding his nose and not the tree, he slipped back and fell far and long, landing with a loud crack. Maxx didn't move. One Xenagon ran over to him. Raelyn couldn't bare to watch. She jumped from the tree to a lower branch on another. She kept doing this until she reached the grassy floor. Raelyn ran as fast as her feet could carry her. She ran until she was out of the forest. A clear field appeared ahead of her, the ground stopping and dripping down at the end. She tried to run to dip in the hill, hoping to find somewhere to hide in there. She turned back and let out a cry. The last thing Raelyn saw as she ran was a white blur with a gun. Whatever it was shot her, hitting her right between the eyes. She fell and her body rolled down the slope. The crew was officially all dead. The Xenagons reached the top of the hill and watched Raelyn's lifeless body roll. Then they turned back, watching their master come and stand next to them. She straightened out her dirty lab coat. She sighed as she looked at Raelyn. \"Poor, poor girl.\" She put her hand on the Xenagon next to her and scratched behind its ear, just the way it liked it. \"Don't worry. They won't try to hurt you anymore.\" She turned on her heel and walked back deep into the forest, Xenagons right behind her. She would wait until her fellow scientists sent another batch of food for her pets. In the meantime, she will just sit and wait. ","Summary":" There had never been a worse time to sneeze.

He strode forwards and stroked the petal of a white lily, his eyes scanning the faces of the surrounding flowers. \"Can I help you?\" she said, leaning onto the counter and brushing her long blonde locks from her shoulders, revealing her plump breasts.

His eyes slid to the price tag and he said, \"Pretty flowers. Pretty nice price too.\" She laughed nervously and stroked a small clump of her hair as he straightened up to face her. \"Well sir, I'm afraid it does cost a little more than usual if you really want to impress someone.\" \"I think …. I think I'll only need a couple of flowers,\" he said firmly, walking back to the lilies and pulling the white one he had stroked and a pair of pink ones out, covering the ebony white tiles in drops of water and a dead leaf. \"These will do,\" he said as he laid them on the counter. Shrugging, the bewildered woman priced them and wrapped the bottoms in paper. As she handed them to him, taking the money from his outstretched hand, she couldn't resist asking, \"Where are you from?\" The man smiled uncomfortably as he replaced his wallet into the inside pocket of his jacket. \"Not around here,\" he said, giving the flowers one last look over. Shutting the till with a bang, she leaned over at him, revealing her breastsonce moreand whined, \"Aw, c'mon. Where from?

People had evacuated from many areas in Perth. I wentnoutside, and looked upon the sky. The object was close- only a skyscraper'snheight away- and although it did not cast a shadow- it almost seemed likenthe sky was darkened because of it- the sky, it seemed, was the shadow. Inran back into the house and overheard that the object will reach groundntomorrow. I was horrified, and ran to my phone. I rang Ben. His dad hadnalready evacuated and told Ben to do so.

I told Ben to hurry, butnI knew the end was coming.nWe turned onto Bannister road at full speed. The sky was still darkening.nIn front of us was a single car that was speeding also, to get away fromnthe object. I was still looking at the car when the sky suddenly becamenablaze with meteorites-, which hammered the car in front and drew both us,nand the driver in the other car to stop and pull over to the side ofnBannister road.

The vast expanse of blacknabove him, undiluted by city lights, is punctuated by the tiniestnsliver of a moon surrounded the brilliant flickers of the ancientnglow from distant suns. Here the canopy seems endless, overwhelming,nand he feels a shudder ripple through him, even inside the \"ratednto 20 degrees\" sleeping bag Emily had so eagerly picked out fornthis Father-Daughter camping trip with the Trail Guides. Evennthis many years later, this much open space is a disconcerting changenfrom the confines of the cramped quarters and metal ceilings andnfloors of the slave ship. In their first months on Earth, he'dnstruggled with warring panic and elation over the sky that, likentheir world, was opened up to them. But there were pitfalls in thisnnew life on a new planet and with a new culture and language tonassimilate and responsibilities and choices available that were bothnterrifying and exhilarating in their strangeness. Susan and he, likenmany Newcomers, had battled the conflicting emotional charge ofnfreedom, of the greatness of both danger and opportunity. Georgenshifts again, the pine needles on the ground crackling slightlynagainst the crisp whisper of the nylon sleeping bag. Tonhis right, a quiet, almost tentative voice says, \"Dad?\" Georgenstarts, swallows, and clears his throat, which still feels slightlyntight when he says, equally softly, \"Yes, Emily?\" \"I'mnglad you came.\" Georgensmiles in the dark, able only to see the outlines of his daughter'snshape next to him in her matching sleeping bag. Shenturns on her side, propping her head up on her hand. Georgenknows that pose will drive boys--Newcomer and human alike--crazy in anfew short years. He tries to push that thought, the thought of herngrowing up, away. \"Arenyou having fun, Dad?\" Henis silent for a moment, looking back at the sky, then at hisndaughter. Thennight is punctuated only by a breath of a breeze blowing the autumnnscent of pine and dust through the needles of the trees on the slopenabove them and the faint, crackling sounds of insects and smallnrodents foraging for food. George remembers when small sounds likenthis, so random after the ordered mechanical sameness of the ship,nwere one of the most terrifying aspects of the early days in thenrefugee camps, how he and Susan had slept on either side ofnEmily--though none of them had those names yet--to buffer her fromnthis strange and threatening new world. Henrealizes that the silence has stretched long and Emily's posture hasnstarted to droop. Georgentakes a breath, holds it for a second. Lets it out. Takes a breathnagain. Speaks this time. Mostly controls the slightly ragged edgento his voice. \"Do you know that it was probably just earliernthis year that I began to believe that you weren't going to be takennaway from us?\" Evennin the dim light, George can see the stiffening in her stance thatnindicates she's frowning. \"Dad--\" Georgenmoves to mimic Emily's pose. \"You truly are a child of ournpeople's lives here, Emily. You may have been on the slave ship, butnit was never your life. Buck is different that way; he's caughtnbetween the worlds. I'm not sure he fully believes in the stabilitynwe've built.\" \"Indon't think I totally...no, that's not true. I do. I've known sincenwe moved into the house, even if I didn't understand it then.\" Emily paused then continued, \"You know, I really missed sleepingnwith you at first.\" Sleepingnwith Emily tucked between them had not been new in the refugee camps;nthey'd been sleeping like that for months already on the ship,nknowing the time was coming. Buck had been taken, and all too soon,nEmily would be too, dragged away screaming for help they could notngive, for protection they could not offer. \"Wenmissed you too. Did you know I used to get up in the middle of thennight and stand in your doorway to watch you sleeping?\" \"Ofncourse I did.\" \"Youndid?\" \"Dad. Duh.\" Even without light he can tell she's rolling her eyes atnhim. \"But I didn't tell mom about it.\" \"Youndidn't?\" \"No.\" Emily plucks at the fabric of her sleeping bag. Then she looks upnand says, \"I didn't tell you she was doing it, did I?\" Hencan hear her broad smile in her voice. \"Well, until now.\" Georgenchuckles and reaches out to touch the side of her face. \"Inlove you very much. And I feel so fortunate to have been allowed tonshare all the parts of your life. Every moment is a blessing.\" He sits up and scoots his sleeping bag a little closer to hers. Pointing at the sky he says, \"Do you see the Big Dipper?\" Shensits up and leans her chin on his shoulder--when did she get tallnenough to do that?--and looks along his arm to where he is pointing. Her hand, pale against the dark sky as it joins his, traces the shapenin the air along with him. \"That one?\" \"Thosentwo stars in the bowl point straight to the North Star.

Billy got up and rushed to the window. He put on his coat and ran out the door. The train stopped outside his house as a tall chunky woman opens up the door to the train and tells billy to get on. He gets on the train and the train continues to pick up kids throughout the neighborhood. \"All 12 of the kids are picked up\" says the man behind the engine room. The man comes out with his conductors hat and his navy blue uniforms with gold buttons, he comes out and welcomes all these little children on The Polar Express! All the kids smile with joy and jump up and down. A little girl comes and sits with Billy. She asks him \"what are we doing here, I've asked everyone and none of us know what is going on?\" The conductor comes out and offers us all hot chocolate and some chocolate chip cookies. The man with the beard closes the door to the control room and tells all the kids to sit down. He says to them \"we are on our way to the north pole\". They arrive at the north pole and what they see they could not unseen. Burning builds, cars smashed, people laying in the streets, and a mansion up on the hill with flames flying up the building. The conductor went to the part of the train the children we're in and told them that they had arrived at their destination and they needed to get off. The time had come and Billy and his friends had no idea what was going to happen next. The kids formed a line on the isle of the train and started to walk single file down of the train. The conductor led them to the mansion telling them \"stay single file or else there would be consequences\" the children had no idea what they were getting involved in. They had arrived at the door, the conductor opened it and told the kids to walk in. They walked in and saw present, lots of presents! They were so excited! Billy was looking around \"ahh this is not real don't fall for it, its just painted boxes, look!\" All of a sudden the kids saw \"SANTA\" the little girl shouted! He wasn't Santa for long when all a sudden he transformed into this red beast thing with a tail and horns coming out of his head, and razor sharp teeth. \"call me Satan\" says the red man, i'm sorry to have you all so spooked but this is all part of the plan as he lets out this hideous laugh. Billy and the little girl hold each others hands they were shaking. Billy had to find a way to get out of here but he had no idea how, there was no cell phones and there was no way of communication. He could not believe that this was really what the north pole looked like. There was no Santa and there was no little elf's and presents and reindeer. He knew something was wrong. He grabbed the little girl and ran into one of the rooms in the mansion \"we are going to come up with a plan to get out of here before Satan notices we are missing\". In the room they see a sword in a glass case that is locked and says \"DO NOT TOUCH\" of course they were not going to listen to that. He grabs one of the vases off the table and smashed the glass case with the sword 'WACK WACK WACK SMASH' suddenly a loud alarm goes off they both grabbed the sword and ran away. They knew it had to be the sword that killed Satan. \"We have to save the other 10 children\" said Billy. The little girl with said \" okay lets do this\". The both of them walk into a closet off the main room and plan out what they are going to do. They find a map in the closet, the children both walk out of the closet and walk to Satan's head quarters, on the way they see all these weird paintings going down the long and dark hallway. They were both scared but they knew that had to stick together; they continued down the hall when all a sudden they hear a very faint scream of a girl coming from one of the side rooms. The both of them looked at each other and knew they should stop and check it out but they did not have the time to stop. They kept running until the reached his room, they both went into together and saw the red man laying in his bed they had taken the sword and stabbed it right into his heart. The red man had turned to stone right in his bed. All the children had come running out of the rooms and huddled together. We had all gotten back on the train and went back home. Billy hugged the girl and thanked her for all her help. They both got off the train and walked into there homes. Billy woke up the next morning from a horrible nightmare.

Billy's lone figure stood in the cold, no longer alone. His hands were tightly clasped around hers, and a small smile appeared on his face. Somehow I could tell this was his very first Christmas spent with someone else. Sensing that they were not alone, they glanced at me. Feeling rather awkward now, I smiled and nodded my head, then turned back into the train car. They followed, picking an empty seat next to mine. We all sat in silence for a few minutes, listening to clacking of the wheels on the rails. The faint sounds of voices could be heard coming from the next car, but we were content to sit in silence for a few more minutes. Billy was the first to speak. \"This is the best Christmas I've ever had.\" She smiled and nodded. \"Me too.\" More silence. A sudden gust of wind hit the back windows, plastering snow onto the glass, which quickly melted. \"I wish this would never end.\" Billy said suddenly. \"I don't want to go back home.\" \"Don't worry; it'll be ok.\" She spoke quietly, softly. \"Don't worry.\" Billy didn't speak, instead he sat and watched the snow rush past out the window. The wind hitting the windows was loud compared to the stillness inside the car. \"I'll miss this, you know.\" Billy was quiet, even when he was talking. \"I will too.\" She whispered. \"Yeah…\" I felt obliged to chime in, seeing as I was there, and all… \"I really don't want to go home.\" Billy's voice broke at the end, and I closed my eyes and hung my head, waves of sorrow washing over me. She scooted closer to him and gently squeezed his hand. We sat in silence for a few more minutes, absorbing each other's company. We knew it would be all over soon; it would be time to move on. Suddenly, her voice pierced the silence. \"Do you want to believe?\" she asked. We all knew what she meant. Billy stared out the window in silence for a few more seconds, contemplating his answer. When he looked up, there was a new light burning in his eyes. \"Yes. Yes, I want to believe.\" There was silence again. I didn't want to speak. I didn't think I could speak. \"Why do good things always have to end?\" Billy asked in a soft, broken voice.

Anyway, here's to friends who stay up late talking to you and Christmas in all its glory! Plot: Akari Kinamoto is 17 and not fond of Christmas. Sure, she'll put on a happy face and look giddy, but she despised the holiday as much as cat's despised water. She finds out, though, that Christmas wasn't what it was made out to be and that, with some help, she too can hear the bells, because the bell still rings for those who truly believe. Start: Akari yawned and checked the time again. It was roughly 10 O'clock and the last of her family members had yet to leave. You see, it was Christmas Eve and her family had, as usual, held their annual family Christmas Party. Sure her younger sister and brother had been allowed to go to bed, but, since she was 17, she had to stay up with all the other adults. She looked around the room again from her position by the wall in a corner. As usual, most of her family ignored her and talked amongst themselves. Besides being known for not liking Christmas, she was known for pushing people away, even if she didn't mean to. She just accepted the fact and let everyone alone, not trying to convince them for the umpteenth time that she was safe to talk to. What seemed like hours later (it was only about half an hour later really), the last of the family left and Akari went up to her room to get ready for bed. She was exhausted seeing as she was dragged out of the house to go Christmas shopping with her family and then her cousins. Then, the next day, she had to wrap presents for everyone else, seeing as she was the only one capable of doing so without messing up the wrapping paper or tearing the scissors in two. (how that happened is beyond me.) She sighed in relief as she slipped into her bed. She hopped she would be able to sleep in, like usual. She was rudely awoken though at 11:55 by the sounds of rumbling. She recognized it as the noise a train made, but what a train was doing near her neighborhood baffled her. She threw on a sweater and walked over to the front door, opening it just as a very loud horn sounded, waking her up fully. She gaped at the train in the street in front of her. It had its name, 'The Polar Express,' printed along its side. She was startled out of her thoughts by someone calling very loudly, \"All aboard!\" while looking at her from the doorway into the train. She quickly inspected the train again, blinking. It seemed a majority of the heads peeking out of the train were those of kids much younger than her. Most likely at least middle school kids. That's when she saw it. The most beautiful face she had ever seen before. It was the only face she had seen that matched hers in age…. ~To Be Continued!~ Hope you liked this chapter!

All of his family was gathered downstairs in front of the TV. \"No, I'm not coming down!\" This didn't make sense to Caleb. Weren't his studies to be more important than movies? The door of his room suddenly opened, and there was Caleb's mom, Katie, holding her camera. \"Caleb, we would like you to come down and be a part of the family, for once,\" said Katie in a stern tone. \"You can do your homework later.\" \"It's better if I get it done now,\" Caleb protested. \"I don't really want to watch a movie, Mom. I'm not in the mood for it.\" He turned his attention back to the Algebra problems that sat on his desk. Then he realized that Katie wasn't going away. \"Mom, I'm not watching a movie!\" \"You're a part of this family, Caleb, and you will come down and be with us,\" said Katie. \"It's almost time for the holidays. It's a time for spending time with family and friends. And you're going to do just that.\" But Caleb still didn't move. \"Caleb, I mean it. Get your butt off that chair and come down.\" \"Caleb, please!\" begged Caleb's younger sister, Hayley, who stood in the door. \"It's a really good movie!\" Her puppy dog eyes merely amused Caleb. \"Please!\" She stuck out her bottom lip. \"I'll be your best friend!\" But Caleb already had a best friend. He didn't need Hayley to be it. \"You know what, Caleb?\" asked Katie. \"I'm done. Let's go, Hayley.\" She slammed the door, something Caleb never thought she'd do. He knew she was trying to use reverse psychology on him. Guess what? It wasn't going to work. Five states away, another family was having a similar problem. \"Sontard, we're making cookies!\" called the voice of fifteen-year-old Gavin's mother from downstairs. \"Come and join us!\" Gavin put his headphones on and blocked her out. \"I can't right now, Mom!\" exclaimed Gavin. \"I have homework to do!\" Christmas finals were in just a few days, and Gavin didn't want to fail. He didn't understand why his sisters, Avia and Emmi, weren't studying as well. Their loss, he supposed. It would be their fault if they failed. Gavin suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder. \"Gavin, come and hang out with us,\" said Colette, Gavin's mother. \"Your homework can wait. It's almost Christmastime. Come and be a part of the family.\" She took a look at his Biology homework. \"You haven't got that much more to do.\" \"But I want to get it done now so I don't have any more to do,\" Gavin explained. \"And then I want to do some studying for the finals. They're not that far off, only a few days. They're the most important thing that's happening this semester.\" \"Gavin, please come down and spend time with the family,\" Colette begged him. \"Your cousins want to see you! They say that they've hardly seen you since we got here! You need to spend time with the family while you can! We don't see them all that often.\" \"Mom, I promise I'll spend time with you guys later!\" Gavin exclaimed. \"But, right now, I want to get all this stuff done. Please, just leave me alone. Tell Cooper and Gage that I'll watch Avengers: Age of Ultron with them after supper.\" Colette sighed. \"Your cousins want to watch How The Grinch Stole Christmas,\" she said. \"It's a more appropriate movie for this time of year, don't you think?\" She smiled. \"You used to love that movie. I have a clip from Christmas 2013, of you and Brock cuddling together. Watching it.\" \"Mom, I said I'd watch Age of Ultron with them!\" Gavin snapped. \"They haven't seen that movie yet! It's really, really good! And plus, The Grinch isn't all that interesting a movie. It's just the same as the animated version, only in live action.\" \"Gavin!\" Colette scolded. \"Just stay up here and do your homework.\" She sighed. \"I'll tell your cousins what you said.\" Disappointed, she shut the door on her oldest son. It wasn't the outcome she had wanted, or expected. Over in New Jersey, a third family was having much the same kind of problem. \"Mom, I have final exams to study for, homework to do, an end-of-school party to organize... I'm busy!\" exclaimed 18-year-old Noah when his mother asked him to come down and participate in family time. \"The final exams aren't for a few days,\" said Jessie, his mother. \"You'll be fine. The homework can wait until later. And the party isn't the most important thing in the universe. You have to come down and spend time with the family, that's an order.\" \"Aye, aye, Captain.\" Noah rolled his eyes, his tone dripping with sarcasm. \"Mom, just let me finish this one thing, and then I'll come and hang with you guys. What are we doing?\" He had a feeling it would be related to the upcoming holiday. \"We're going tobagganing!\" exclaimed Jessie. \"And then we're going to Step-Great-Grandma's! She's so excited to see you guys!\" They usually went to their Step-Great-Grandmother's house just before Christmas or on Christmas Eve. \"The tobagganing I'll do,\" Noah said, \"But I'm not going to Step-Great-Grandma's.\" It was the same, boring thing every year. It would be nothing new to Noah. He really didn't want to go, whatever anyone said to him, no matter what bribe. \"But why not?\" asked Jessie. \"Step-Great-Grandma looks so forward to seeing us every year! She'll be so upset if you miss going this year.\" Great-Grandma's step-great-grandchildren were one of the prides in her life. \"Mom, I'm not going,\" said Noah. \"I'm either going tobagganing and not going to Step-Great-Grandma's or I'm not doing anything at all. I could be doing something worthwhile, like studying, homework, or helping Elli with planning the party.\" \"Fine,\" sighed Jessie. \"But you'd better hold true to your promise, or I'm coming up here when it's time to go and dragging you down.\" She sent him a death glare that meant she was serious. \"We'll see you down in an hour.\" \"All right,\" Noah said, and turned his attention back to his homework, not giving any thought to how upset his behavior might be making his family - which it was. Noah had changed over the past few years. Just a few years ago, he had been a Christmas-zilla, now he was the equivalent of the Grinch. Each mother, at that exact moment, was thinking the same thing: What has happened to my son? Will he ever get back to the way he used to be? Is there a way to make that happen? It was stressing each of the mothers out. Unbeknownst to them, there was a solution in the very near future.

He would ring the bell for his little doll and smile at her gleeful smiles and laughs that filled the room at hearing the sound. Chris loved her greatly, and he raised her to believe in many things like the Easter Bunny Tooth Fairy and Santa. He was very happy to say he raised her well.

Another was a pair of skates, she was so excited and thanked him so many times, but he told her \"Those are from Santa honey.

Beno said, \"I was just checking since I see an elf walking towards us.\" We turned around, and sure enough a short old lady approached us. By now, Masayo, Jewel, and a few unknown storytellers gathered in front of the house. The short old lady said, \"Have you ever seen a country that focus on Christmas all year long?...Everything is related to Christmas…\" Beno interrupted, \"Yep, I know you now. Story time!\" Tom asked, Story time? I thought I was getting a present.\" The old lady continued, \"They give and receive with gladness. They are short like me. They are not like humans…What are they?...\" We puzzled at that question when suddenly we entered the story zone. .. It was Christmas evening when a boy crawled into bed. He heard his parents talking to his sister in her room. It was located across from his. Sarah asked, \"Why couldn't you hear the bell?\" Her mother said, \"The bell is broken.\" Sarah replied, \"No, the bell is not broken. I heard its beautiful sound.\" Dad laughed, \"Then it must be your imagination.\" Sarah asked, \"It is?\" Mother replied, \"Yes, it is. Your imagination is working again…Time for bed.\" Sarah said, \"Good night!\" Mother and Father said, \"Good night Sarah!\" The boy quietly pulled out the little bell. He gently shook it and the bell dinged several times. He sighed and remembered that fateful night…It all happened one year ago on Christmas Eve. He had doubts before the arrival of the Polar Express. He believed after he had met Santa Claus. He wondered why his parents couldn't hear the bell… He stared at the ceiling and thought, \"Why didn't his parents hear the bell? They always told me that they believed in Santa Claus…\" Now the boy began to have doubts about his parents' words. He fell asleep dreaming of the Polar Express… The old lady added, \"Last summer the flu went around. His sister caught it but he never did. The doctors thought that was strange. They did a full examination on the boy but nothing came up. His mother was a little worried… A few minutes later, his parents came into the room. His mother touched the boy's forehead gently. Father whispered, \"He will be fine.\" Mother said, \"I know that…But he still has that bell.\" Father said, \"He is asleep now…Time to go to bed.\" Mother closed the door and joined her husband in the bedroom. She went into the bathroom to brush her teeth. She thought, \"I recognized that bell anywhere. It is from Santa's sled. Did he go on that train?\" She paused for a few moments to rinse out her mouth. Her eyes wandered over to the medicine cabinet. She opened it and examined the bottles. She picked out the smallest bottle and closed the cabinet. She read, \"The medicine that will caused memory loss of an elf.\" She sighed, \"I am sorry my son but I can't lose you. I must block out those memories.\" She walked out of the bathroom and set the bottle on the nightstand. Her husband was in bed doing his devotions. They both were very strong Christians. He saw the bottle and asked, \"It is that time again?\" She nodded, \"Yes it is. The doctor called and said that Jason must retake the medicine.\" The father thought for a moment. He couldn't recall the doctor's call today. He asked, \"When did he call? Today is Christmas, no one is at work.\" She said, \"Oh, he called couple days ago. You were not around when he called.\" The father said, \"Ok.\" She sighed happily. She got into bed. The father thoughts, \"That is strange. The doctor is doing house calls? Something is very strange here. If I remember correctly, the doctor said that the test was positive…This was a very strange year. It all started with that bell…\" Meanwhile on the other side of the bed, the mother stared at the ceiling. She thought, \"Oh my, I don't like to lied but I need to.

The temperature had dropped twenty degrees in the past hour alone, but in the passenger cars of the train, a number of about 10 kids sat without a care in the world, warmer than they'd ever remembered being. But not everyone was happy as a clown. No, there was one \"passenger\" who was definitely feeling the effects of the cold winds and icy pellets. For atop the Polar Express , the glorious machine that rattled almost gracefully over the slick rails, there was a man. He sat hunched over on an old wooden crate, staring dismally at a small pie of measly sticks that simply refused to become the rip-roaring fire he so desperately needed. He glanced yet again at the rapidly-diminishing pile of matches remaining in the matchbox he clutched in his hand. Only three left. Not that he'd started out with very many; the crummy matchbooks in the train stations never provided many sticks inside them. The man heaved a sigh that would have had great gusto if it had not been immediately lost to the shrieking winds. What he wouldn't give to be inside one of the cars, sipping steaming hot chocolate from a porcelain mug and warming his chilled bones! But such wistful thoughts were of no use to him. He was a hobo, a tired, grungy homeless man who had not a dime in his worn pocket to pay for a ticket to ride on such a train. So he'd had to \"hop\" the train, hitching a ride in the cold in an effort to get away from the last train station, presumably only to find himself in an almost identical station. And repeat. Sighing again, he withdrew yet another match. Shielding it as best he could, he struck it against the side of the matchbox. A small, flickering, orange flame appeared, and, like a pack of wolves descending on a helpless lamb, the wind began earnestly trying with al its might to devour that spark. The hobo, relentless, covered it with his hand and held it down to the sticks gathered at his feet. He held is breath and waited. There! Finally, what he'd been waiting for all along! The flames began to leap up from the wood, sparking and snapping in defiance to the wind's influence. The man allowed himself a small grin and reached out his hands to warm them with the fire's heat. Suddenly, the train began to rattle and shake, and the hobo glanced over his shoulder too late to realize that they had come to a tunnel's entrance. He didn't have time to throw himself flat on the roof. It wouldn't have helped him anyway. There was but one inch of clearance between the roof of the train and the roof of the tunnel. So he died a silent death, and was blown away by the howling wind. His fire, that he'd worked so hard to build, surrendered itself to the wind and blew out. And later, when the fireman came to shovel another heap of coal into the fire, to his great surprise there was a small, crummy matchbox mixed in with the coal. It only had two matches left inside.

I do not have a beta for this story. I will probably not find a beta for this story, so read at your own risk. I developed (in my mind) the character Asona and her basic story years ago but only now filled in the rest. The stories of Emily and Buck always interested me the most about the show because they had the unique struggle with their identities. Once they were denied their Tenctonese culture only to be bombarded with human culture for the rest of their upbringing, they were truly between worlds. Story Summary: Buck has struggled with fully accepting Earth as his home, but a possible connection to this world comes in the strangest form. Chapter Summary: The whole story is based on this scene from \"Little Lost Lamb\" so I decided to add it in as a chapter. Disclaimer: Of course, Alien Nation concept, characters, etc. do not belong to me. Chapter 1: My Savior Buck sat on the rocks near the edge of the ocean water with his Uncle Moodri as the sea air burned his nose. Although tolerable, he would endure just about anything for elusive answers to those unanswerable questions in his hearts. \"What now, Uncle?\" he asked the elder in their Tenctonese language, hoping for wisdom of what to do next. \"We continue,\" the elder responded simply in their language, as though it were nothing more than walking through a door. But it wasn't that simple and the catastrophic outcome panicked Buck. \"We can't!\" Buck held the elder Tenctonese man's arm tightly. Buck had shown bravery in many ways but the idea of saltwater dissolving their skin like battery acid made him tremble like a small child. It was a fear that reminded him of being taken away from his parents on the slave ship when younger. \"The salt water could kill us!\" he reminded his uncle of their certain death if they were to go anywhere near the ocean water. \"Will it?\" the man's aged eyes emphasized the question. Still afraid, Buck let his hands drop and said nothing more as the man walked away from the boy. Buck watched as his uncle sank his toes into the cool moist sand. They should've burned a little as summer, sun-heated pavement burned bare feet, but his uncle showed no outward sign if they did. But there was no hint of pain on the wrinkled face. In fact, Buck was certain it was more contentment than anything else. One foot in front of the other carried the elder to the edge of the water. Buck stepped closer, careful not to surround himself with the moist sand but to get a better look at whatever it was his uncle had planned. It was then that the next tide of seawater came in and washed over the man's feet. The old man turned to face his disbelieving nephew, reassuring him with a smile and arms raised as though proving to a small child that there were no monsters in the closet. \"How?\" Buck questioned, desperate for something to make sense. \"I am part of it,\" the man now explained in English, \"and it is part of me. Come Finiksa! Believe that and the water can't hurt you.\" Buck wanted to believe it. Somewhere deep in his hearts he needed to believe it, but as his eyes fell to the saltwater, the fear ignited the panic and he found himself involuntarily moving away. \"I'm not you, Uncle.\" Buck admitted, also switching to English. He was disappointed in himself more than he was before they'd come to this forsaken place, \"I don't have your faith.\" Perhaps sensing his young nephew's turmoil, Moodri's voice still spoke with all of the wisdom Buck had learned to expect but the tone was also soothing, understanding, \"There's no shame in that. Shame is for those who remain blind to themselves.\" \"I don't know where I belong or who I am!\" Buck called out. Although it was to his uncle, it was more of a declaration for himself. Finally, he could say it openly. Half of his life was on the ship in space and the other half on this alien world. In the end, where did that leave him? His uncle could see something break through within his young relative and knew it was time to tell Buck what had to be told. \"With each breath, you join this Earth.\" \"Are you saying I belong here?\" How could he? Buck loved his people and he could never accept humans with the same love. \"I hate this world!\" Moodri disregarded the statement, \"All worlds are stardust. This world, our world. We are stardust. Scattered, drifting, yet united by one voice. The voice that tells the leaves to turn to the light, the flowers to bloom. It speaks to you too.\" Buck wanted to believe his uncle in all things, because even he could sense the truth of what the man offered but they were just words in his hearts. \"I can't hear it,\" Buck felt the same panic he felt when watching his uncle walk into the water that should have burned him. \"I know,\" the corners of his uncle's mouth turned upward into the smile that strangely gave Buck some comfort. \"You carry a wound. And until that wound is cleansed you won't be able to hear the voice.\"[Chapter 2] Buck sat on his parents' sofa staring at the paper in his hand. It had been so long since he'd seen his uncle. Not once did Buck visit the man that gave him his life back, that set him on a better path. It was the same man that gave him some sense of hope that he would belong on this alien planet. Dear Francisco family, it is with great sorrow that we must inform you of the recent death of Thomas Lamas, known to us and others by his Tenctonese name Moodri. We will send belongings shortly after this message is mailed. I would like to express my deepest condolences and we, too, grieve the passing of such a unique soul. Martha Ryers Species Unification Through Scientific and Spiritual Advancement Part of him wished he weren't there before everyone else to bring in the mail. A few more hours of blissful ignorance would have been welcome. But what would that have helped? This was guilt and there was no way, now, to make up for it. During his teen years, if not for his uncle's careful guidance, Buck could have ended up in prison or worse. But then Uncle Moodri left and Buck had been so swept up in life that he never thought to check up on the wise elder. Buck remembered sitting on the outcropping of rocks with his uncle, his life on a knife's edge. He'd just killed a boy in self defense but that made no difference. More than the worry of the law catching up with him, he felt the destruction of his soul having taken a life. Each night when all was quiet, he saw the boy's face after the bullet hit, just before death. Each day he saw the boy's face in every human he passed by. Then his uncle led him to one of his greatest fears. Confronting that fear surfaced yet another, deeper fear. The answer to both was to make peace with this world where his family, his people now lived on. Buck closed his eyes and pressed the letter between his hands the way some humans prayed. If only he could hold the letter tightly enough, believe in it hard enough that perhaps he could see his uncle one last time. If only he could thank the man that set him on the right path. Uncle Moodri saved his life and he never thanked him. Now, he never could.[Chapter 3] Little Tencton was quieter than other areas of Los Angeles at night. Like any other section of the city, it had its seedier side. But Tenctonese senses were sharper than humans so criminals had to hide their activities more efficiently. This was the reason why most of the street cops in Little Tencton were Tenctonese. Perfectly understandable, but it was still little comfort for the Tenctonese officers. There wasn't a lot of opportunity to work their way up and elsewhere when always assign to the small section of the city. It didn't help that many humans, in and out of uniform, felt that it was where all Tenctonese belonged anyway. Buck felt the oppressive weight of prejudice and politics more so on nights like these. His annoying night-time schedule along with being pigeon-holed to one location seemed like the hallmark of the same old, same old for his kind. Sure, his father made detective, but everyone knew that was a publicity stunt the police department pulled to quiet concerns and bad press. And it did work for his father and the department, but all of the movement forward for his people, at least where the police were concerned, stopped there. In the last week there had been eight murders, all involving human women that were somehow tied to the SUTSSA offices. SUTSSA, Species Unification Though Scientific and Spiritual Advancement, was an organization only a half decade old and already caused quite a stir. They advocated the union of the two species in all possible ways which ignited the anger of several human and Tenctonese segregationist organizations. It didn't help that human women seemed to drop like flies around them. Buck made his way down the street heading to where he agreed to meet back with his partner, Pam. All was quiet, he thought to himself taking the silence of their mobile walkie-talkies to assume the same for Pam. For Tectonese, though, silence was relative. When turned on, but unused, the walkie-talkie mobile phones crackled of dead. It was a sound only the sensitive hearing of his people could pick up. In the building he just passed, from some unknown apartment, he could hear the muffled sounds of intimacy. This was Little Tencton and therefore they were soft moans blending with humming. \"At least someone's happy tonight,\" a feminine voice only slightly lower pitched than normal bemused as she reached out to pat Buck's shoulder. Officer Pamela Kaykes eyes scanned the building. Obviously she was more curious to determine from which apartment the sounds emanated. It seemed the observing privacy was not shared by all of his people. It wasn't something he wanted to do, at all, and Pam finally gave up when she realized her patrol partner made his way to the end of the next block. She rushed to catch up with him and Buck heard her grumble just before settling into step, \"I guess it's for the best. Just a reminder of what I'm not getting. She stopped at an entrance to an alley and Buck hadn't noticed until he was already at his destination, in front of the SUTSSA building. The female police officer squinted, straining to see down the nearby alley. Sighing, Buck was ready to chastise Pam for listening in on yet another couple when she lifted her hand with her pointer finger extended. Buck figured this couldn't be mere eavesdropping and decided to concentrate on any sounds around them as well. In the alley, he heard a muffled breath and then a choked cough. Pam heard the sound first and raced into the dark walkway between the two buildings before Buck realized what was happening. In mid-stride, Pam pulled her gun out while Buck took a more cautious approach and walked slowly into the dark passage with his gun drawn. His eyes shift from left to right as he listened for something to give more of a clue as to what was going on and where. It occurred to him that he and Pam may not be the only ones in the darkness with excellent hearing. A Newcomer would hear just as well. At the end of the alleyway was a central open area where the back of five buildings met. Buck could make out one massive shadow Pam ran toward at full speed and he tried to squint, hoping for some adjustment to the lower light. The large shadow was actually two bodies that were closely entwined, and eventually he could make out the shape of hands of the larger person trying to overpower the smaller person. Bald, spotted heads let him know that both were Tenctonese and he could make out tape across the mouth of the obviously feminine form struggling with her aggressor with something tied around her neck. \"Freeze!\" Pam roared. Closer to the two than Buck was, she continued to charge at them. Startled, the shadow of the man dropped the woman and ran down one of the other alleyways. Typical of his partner, Pam rushed passed the woman with little regard for her injury and began pursuit. Concern for the victim took a back seat to the thrill of the chase? Collapsing to the ground, the victim tried to catch her breath as her hands held what had to have been a tender throat. She ripped the tape from her mouth and unwound the rope from her throat while trying to take full breaths that seemed to be difficult from the sound of them. Without thinking, Buck reached for this mobile and called for back-up, explaining that someone near the SUTSSA building had been attacked. This time it wasn't a human woman and Buck wondered if the killer was branching out to different species. \"Ma'am, are you okay enough to stand?\" Buck noticed her spots and could not help the instinctual attraction to the pattern. Pushing back a natural response, he dealt with the more pressing issue of an injured victim. He held his hand out to support her. The woman rasped a response but when it became too uncomfortable she quietly took his hand to stand on wobbly legs. Buck's eyes could not help but stare at the shapely spots of her head but then a breath caught in his throat as his body suddenly became confused in its response of attraction. The woman had ears, and eyebrows. \"Thank you, officer,\" she thanked him and he had to take a moment for it to register in his mind which language she spoke. It was his people's language spoken perfectly, albeit raspy. Buck couldn't speak, he couldn't move as her eyes met his. Her face hit a sliver of light from the main street and he saw the rich caramel color of her skin and there was no doubt that this was a human but where she should have had hair were very well-formed spots of a deep, rich brown. \"I appreciate your help, officer,\" the woman switched to English. It didn't take long for her to notice Buck hadn't moved. His eyes focused on her and she continued, \"Is there something wrong?\" Buck blinked to regain his senses as he slowly heard her words and finally remembered how to speak, \"Are you human?\" The words tumbled out of his mouth before he regained all of his wits and wished he could pull back the words. The woman's emerald green eyes, sparkling like jewels in the slice of light that cut through the dark, focused on Buck and her lips curled into a mischievous smile that reached all the way up to the two emeralds. \"Yes.\" From the main road, he heard cars screeching to a halt and feet hitting the pavement. Voices added to the commotion as Buck helped the woman to the other officers trying to figure out the crime scene. He tried not to look but couldn't help himself. His eyes glanced peripherally and again would not have believed the woman was human if not for her ears, her eyebrows and her tanned skin. Tenctonese didn't have ears, they had slits that curled in various shapes. His people didn't have very much hair either, especially not eyebrows. And her skin color, that soft kiss of brown. Tenctonese were a pale pink color and couldn't tan. He'd heard of humans tattooing their bodies with Tentonese spots and most allowed their body hair to partially cover them but few wore their tattoos bald and none chose such shapely spots that called out to him on such a basic level. \"Asona,\" a Tenctonese woman called toward them. At least this time Buck was fairly sure this was an authentic Tenctonese woman. Kathy Sykes was the wife of his father's partner, Matt Sykes. Seemingly familiar with the victim, Kathy wrapped her arms around the strange human when she came close. \"Thank you, Buck,\" Kathy turned toward him for a quick moment before returning her attention to the one she called Asona. \"A so na\" was a very old phrase among his people. Directly translated, it meant \"In as I\" which was similar to the phrase \"we're in the same boat\". His uncle Moodri taught him that. Pam jogged to his side from one of the other four alleys and out of the one they'd originally entered, trying desperately to catch her breath and looking around in the din. \"All this for a one woman?\" Taking in the scene of five police cars and four detectives including his father and Matt, Buck wondered the same thing. Clapping his shoulder, Pam jolted him out of the chaos and back to duty, \"I think we have reports to fill out, Partner,\" Pam reminded him. Nodding in her direction, Buck took one last look at the strange human woman that, at first glace, looked Tenctonese. She was surrounded by an older human woman and an elder Tenctonese man with Kathy. Buck heard the names of the new arrivals from the flurry of voices, Martie and William. Catching his eyes lingering on her again, Asona smiled in his direction before Buck, embarrassed, quickly left to rejoin Pam.[Chapter 4] With two girls, his parents' house was rarely a quiet place. One teen and one toddler, there was a steady stream of commotion that washed through the house and into their lives. Four o' clock in the morning Buck closed the front door to his parents' house behind him gently. This was the time when everyone slept and he could enjoy the house alone and in silence. Flopping on the sofa, Buck rested his head on one arm of the sofa and stretched his legs out to the other end. The fabric was worn and comfortable as only an old, broken-in piece of furniture could be. With his forearm, he covered his eyes from the low light of the lamp his mother kept lit for him at night. At least she did after he'd broken her favorite vase stumbling in the dark. The vase she'd shaped with her own hands. After a long night of filling out the report for the attack in the alley, his body relaxed into the beginning of sleep. From the kitchen there was some chatter and occasionally voices rose in heated discussion then lowered to an average volume. Buck was sure Matt and Kathy were visiting. But no matter how quiet the house would have been or how loud the voices in the kitchen got, there was only one voice Buck heard. He'd heard it once, earlier in the night but it echoed in his mind since. During his drive to the station, he heard her. Filling out the report on the incident in the alley, he heard her. His entire drive home, he heard her. \"Noke vot, alsolso.\" \"Thank you, officer,\" in perfect Tenctonese that he never knew a human mouth could achieve. The words simply thanked him but in her sultry voice, they might as well have been an invitation to her bed by the way his body reacted. Those mesmerizing eyes focusing on him in a dark alley popped into his mind every time his eyes closed. A beautiful shade green that one would guess could not exist in nature, human or Tenctonese. Even now his body heated at the thought of the tone of her voice and how it might sound humming along his body. \"Buck,\" his baby sister yawned from the top of the staircase and the tiny voice was as sobering as a cold shower. The rise in temperature throughout his body plummeted in an instant. \"What's all the noise?\" she asked. Rushing to the stairs, he took a seat on a step below his sister to see her eye to eye. \"Shhh,\" he murmured and with a loosely balled fist, he pressed his knuckles gently against her temple and felt the small child's pulse. \"Matt and Kathy are here.\" Vesna smiled and rubbed her eyes. The couple in the house was nothing new to the family, although it was much later and much louder than usual. About to take her hand to walk her back to her bedroom, Buck heard a voice at the bottom of the stairs. Vesna smiled as the person greeted them, \"Hello, Buck… can I call you Buck?\" The world slowed and his body froze. When he finally regained his senses he turned to find those green eyes that haunted him all night staring at him again. Her full lips formed a smile and he felt the pink blood in his body coursing. Again, she spoke perfectly in his language right down to properly placed clicks and accent. It wasn't until Vesna spoke that he realized he hadn't answered her question. \"Of course you can call him Buck. That's his name, silly,\" Vesna answered for him in the mish-mash of Tenctenglish. At least, that's what they called it nowadays. Suddenly aware that his jaw froze when his body unfroze, Buck managed, with some difficulty, to ask, \"Asona… you're here?\" A faint twitch at the corners of her mouth hinted that she restrained an amused smile. With a jerk of her thumb in the direction of the kitchen, Asona then sighed with a defiant pout, \"They're planning my life in the kitchen.\" Asona stepped closer, her full lips stretching into a sweet, friendly smile directed to the person beside Buck, \"And what's your name?\" \"Vesna,\" the child spoke proudly. Then her brow ridge furrowed and Buck figured she noticed the undeniably human features. The woman offered a curt bow of her head, \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Vesna.\" The child giggled then bowed her head in response. Just before turning and running up the stairs, Vesna leaned in close to her brother and whispered in his ear-opening, \"I like her, Buck. Keep her.\" The two silently watched the girl leave and as the little form disappeared into the second floor, he prayed to their sacred patriarch Andarko that Asona didn't hear Vesna's words. He struggled to turn his body toward her and bring his eyes to meet hers again, but when he did, those emerald green eyes trapped him. They locked him in place. Why was she so enticing? Enhancing the features of her face, it bothered him that her spots contributed to her beauty so much. They weren't even hers, just tattoos she'd chosen to have applied to her skin. She was a human. No matter what she was, he couldn't stop his body from reacting to the sound of her or the sight of her. Words were lost in his throat as he tried to speak, but only managed strangled exhales. Saved by the commotion of two couples coming from the kitchen, Buck had the first full breath he hadn't had since he was aware Asona was in the room. \"We've worked out a compromise,\" Kathy smiled in Asona direction, but the human woman cast a skeptical eye at her Tenctonese friend. \"Yes,\" Buck's father agreed enthusiastically, \"Asona requires around the clock protection and I'm sure Grazier will assign you, Buck.\" Buck felt one of his hearts stop. \"It's a perfect idea. He can stay with you during the night in your apartment and during the day we will have armed police officers protecting the office,\" Kathy completed the well thought out ambush. Asona's eyes turned downward in thought then glanced in Buck's direction before her eyes returned to Kathy. \"Has anyone asked Buck?\" \"Oh, he wouldn't mind. Would you, Buck?\" his mother finally joined in the ambush aiming all eyes in his direction, including a pair of green that caused his insides to hum. His second heart seized. She had such an unsettling effect on him just by standing near him for minutes, what would he do with entire nights with her? His mind churned, thinking of any and every way to get out of it politely. The only thing he could think of that might work was a long shot. \"I don't think she'd want me hanging around her apartment from one end of the night to the other,\" he tried to speak casually but even he noticed the doubt in his voice. Asona reached for the banister of the stairs and leaned on it, her eyes looking directly at him when she spoke the words that made him picture humming down her spine, \"I don't mind having you in my apartment, Buck. You are very welcome.\" \"Besides,\" Matt chortled, \"it's Buck and a patrol car at night or whisked away at some secret SUTSSA compound.\" Asona's eyes widened, \"A patrol car too?\" Her body slumped and Buck could tell she was finally defeated. Buck wasn't sure what Matt meant by his reference to a SUTSSA compound but the thought didn't weigh too heavily in his mind as he watched Asona discuss the particulars with his parents, Matt, and Kathy. He couldn't help but study the way her lush lashes dusted her cheeks or how her lips pouted whenever that secret compound was mentioned. No longer just focused on her tattooed spots, Buck focused on the shapeliness of her jaw, her neck, and her shoulders. It wasn't until he heard his name repeated several times in his mind that he realized it was just catching up to reality. His name wasn't just in his mind but his parents trying to get his attention. Finally he snapped out of whatever trance he was in, to notice. There were some details discussed between his parents, Matt, Kathy, and Asona but had no idea what they were. When he felt his eyes flush, his mother rescued him by explaining that Asona would stay in their house for the night and in the morning Buck would drive her to work. There was no question that he would, at least as far as his parents and Kathy were concerned. It wasn't as though he could find his voice long enough to participate in the conversation. xxx Laying on his bed with his head supported by his folded arms, Buck stared at the ceiling of his trailer. He'd never been so grateful for having the RV his parents allowed him to use in the driveway as a makeshift apartment as he was at the moment. Not only was it a great way to save his money for a first house instead of an apartment. But most important, in the living room of his parents' house, only half a driveway and a walk through the front door away, was a woman that occupied every thought he'd had since he'd met her. Before leaving, he saw his mother lay out the nicer sheets she reserved for guests only on the couch with pillows. Buck couldn't help but wonder if those sheets would smell like her in the morning. He hadn't noticed until that moment that he'd remembered everything about her, including her scent of apples and jasmine. Why didn't she smell like other humans? Especially in the summer, his people had to make use of several cans of air fresheners. Here was one human that he not only could tolerate but actually smelled sweet and alluring to him. A tap at his RV door broke his concentration from the one thing, the one person he wished he could push out of his mind. He opened the RV door and there she was to greet him. \"May I come in?\" the tone of her words was sweet and caressed his imagination as he thought of the mouth they came from and the tongue that manipulated the sounds. He couldn't speak and could barely move enough to give her room for entrance. As Asona entered his trailer, her shoulder brushed his arm from the cramped quarters. Her eyes looked around the small area at nothing in particular. \"I just wanted to thank you for tonight.\" Buck tried to explain that his partner Pam scared the perpetrator away but the words came out strained and mashed. Heat rushed to his eyes and he knew he was blushing. His only hope was that she, as a human, didn't notice that Tenctonese blush differently. \"Do I make you nervous?\" she asked him. He should've known she knew how Tenctonese blushed. Spotted as a Tenctonese woman would be, speaking their language as a native speaker would, even her mannerisms were what one would expect from a woman of his people, it should've been expected that she would know such things. When she took a step closer to him, he responded by involuntarily stepping away. What did he fear? The warm smile faded and was replaced with one far more forced and uncomfortable. She bid him good night and moved to leave the trailer but as she walked passed him, Buck inhaled her scent deeply. She must have heard him because she turned and her eyes scanned his face quickly. Buck tried to smile and say goodbye but she surprised him by pressing her lips against his. It was pleasant as he'd experienced years ago with another woman. Her lips pulled away and she then pressed the side of her head to his. To humans, it was such a simple gesture but for Tenctonese, it aroused the senses. Even now he felt his blood rush to his genitals. Watching her leave the RV and walking back to the house, Buck knew he was not going to get much sleep this night. xxx After George saw their guests to their car and Susan spread the sheets and pillows along the sofa, both made their way to the kitchen to allow Asona time to adjust to her makeshift bed. George grabbed a container of spoiled milk from the refrigerator and set out two glasses while Susan cleared the snacks of vegetables she'd set out for their guests. \"That poor girl,\" Susan looked up at her husband from her bent position at the fridge. George filled the first glass halfway and began pouring into the second. The scowl on his face was the telltale sign of something more pressing on his mind than the emotional well-being of the strange human girl. \"I wonder why Kathy is so adamant about protecting her,\" he spoke to himself aloud while closing the container of rotten milk, sniffing it just before returning it to the fridge over Susan's shoulder. After closing the refrigerator, Susan leaned against the wooden counter to take her glass of chilled, expired milk. For a second, while inhaling the strong aroma, she considered how strange spoiled, pasteurized milk could produce such a beautiful product. Reminded quickly of their current conversation by the seemingly permanent scowl of her husband, she had to admit Kathy was acting strange. Although their friend wouldn't explain why Asona and several other human women were so important, she did let slip during their conversation that it was something important found in their blood. George was the first to react when they heard the front door open and close. He rushed into the living room and made his way to the side windows of the front door, with Susan close behind, just in time to watch Asona walk to the RV and enter. Susan turned to her husband, \"Did you see Buck? Did you see his eyes whenever he looks at her?\" Finally the scowl on her husband's face softened and in moments was replaced with a tentative smile, \"She does have great taste in spots.\" The two, with their milk in hand, made their way up the stairs and to their bedroom as Susan added, \"I like her.\" ","Summary":" Title: Species Adapting Series: Alien Nation Rating: T Notes: There may be an M-rated chapter or tw"},{"Movie":"Alien Nation","Title":"The Homecoming","Author":"StuffedAnimal18","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4449210","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I know I shouldn't be starting a new fic when I haven't finished my others, but I had inspiration and just had to write this. I am hoping this will help me work through the writer's block I have with my other stories, hope you like it! THE HOMECOMING Chapter 1 \"Please buckle your seatbelts, we will be landing at LAX very shortly, thank you.\" The somewhat nasal sounding voice of the pilot woke Tessa Andrews from the light doze she had finally been able to slip into 10 minutes before. Straightening up she quickly locked her seatbelt into place and looked out the small porthole like window to her right. Below her she could just begin to see the outline of the Las Angeles airport. The sight of that big facility made what was happening to her finally feel real, and it scared her to death. She was really going to Las Angeles, she who had only gone outside of her small Massachusetts town maybe twice in her lifetime was now going to be living in one of the biggest cities in the country. Talk about a big change. As she turned from her outside view she overheard a conversation between a couple seated next to her. To any one else it may of sounded like a bunch of clicks and strange sounds but to Tessa who had studied Tecktanise for the last year she could catch enough of the words to know the jest of the argument. The woman was complaining that the airline weasel was just awful and next time she would be getting the salad. The male said something about all airline food being awful and for the woman to settle down because it would make the pod upset. Tessa smiled at that, the couple was expecting a child and if it was still in the pod stage they still had a couple of months to go. The couple were newcomers, part of over 250,000,000 slaves from an alien spacecraft that had crash landed in the Mojave Desert over five years before. They had assimilated into Las Angeles a town not unused to strange and unusual groups of people living among them. Yet in the past few years newcomers had begun to immigrate farther east until even Tessa's small hometown of Spencerville, MA now had two new families of the aliens living there. Tessa had been one of the first people to welcome and befriend them soon becoming a common face among their households. She had learned a lot about their culture and also some of their language although she had to admit there was still so much she still did not know. Not all of their neighbors were welcoming however and Tessa also saw first hand the predjuce some of the townspeople showed to her new friends. This hospitality was part of the reason why she decided to move to Las Angeles the other was Keith Thompson. Keith was a deputy at Spencerville's small town sheriff's office. He only worked their part time but he was a full time purist. He was one of the main opposers to the newcomers coming to stay in their town. When Tessa stood up with her new friends against him Keith had seemed stunned. He also treated her as if she had been brainwashed by Katie and Tom Seleck, gotta love those guys at newcomer affairs with their name choices, one of the newcomer couples. They were kind, hardworking people and Tessa had become good friends with them, especially Katie who was close to her in age. They found they had a lot in common and hung out a lot. Tessa knew that by being friends with Katie she was pushing away others she had know for most of her life but she also knew Katie and the others deserved a chance and respect. Keith just didn't seem to get that she was friends with the newcomers by choice. He also didn't seem to understand that she was not interested in him in the slightest. Tessa thought she had the situation under control until one night Keith pulled her over as she was on her way home from work. He said she had been speeding but Tessa knew otherwise. Even so he made her get out of the car to do a field sobriety test and while she was standing on one foot touching her finger to her nose feeling like a complete idiot Keith attempted to fondle her and kiss her. Furious and also full of panic Tessa did the first thing that popped into her head, she kicked him in the groin hard and ran to her car. This time she really was speeding as she made her way to her parents' house not wanting to be alone in her apartment that night. After telling her parents about the incident her mother told her she had had enough and didn't feel like Tessa was safe in town. She told Tessa that she wanted her to move to L.A. to live with her Uncle Matt. Uncle Matt was Detective Matthew Sykes of the L.A.P.D. He had been an infrequent yet much beloved visitor in Tessa's youth. He always came with presents and war stories of his time as a cop, edited for small ears of course. Tessa had idolized him growing up and even though most of that hero worship had dimmed over time, she still loved him to pieces and missed him terribly. Still she hated people to think that some small town horny sheriff's deputy had run her out of town just because he couldn't take no for an answer. Yet Tessa's mother could be as stubborn as her daughter and in the end Tessa caved under her mothers concern and logic about the situation. Just like she knew she would, whatever Marlene Sykes Andrews wanted she usually got, and most often she was always right. The feel of the aircrafts tires hitting the runway knocked Tessa out of her thoughts. Well she was here; she just wondered one thing as the plane made its way to its gate. What am I going to do now? Marlene Sykes Andrews looked at the clock on her kitchen wall. It was now 2:00 pm; Tessa's plane would have just landed. God she hoped Matt remembered to pick her up from the airport. Matt's memory was never his strong suit, at least when it came to his personal life. Marlene could never figure out how he could remember the date and time of when a drug bust would be going down but couldn't remember her birthday to save his life. Sitting down in the chair she had abandoned only moments before she picked up her needlepoint for the fourth time trying unsuccessfully to finish the nose of a dog on what would be when finished a blanket for her new grandson. Yet again she placed it back down on the table after only a few stitches too nervous to concentrate fully on the task. She knew she had nothing to worry about, Tessa was very responsible and she was going to stay with her uncle who also happened to be a cop. She would be perfectly safe, still she was a mother and she wouldn't be a good one if she didn't worry needlessly about at least one of her three children. She knew she had done the right thing by sending Tessa to L.A. Things were getting to hot here and as much as she knew Tessa wanted to stay and help, Keith Thompson was becoming too much of a loose cannon for it to be safe for her little girl anymore. That boy had always worried her from the time he was little. He was just too quiet for her always looking at Tessa with those piercing blue eyes of his, following her around like a puppy dog. When they both got older he seemed to be a little too interested in her daughters' comings and goings for her to feel comfortable, especially after he became a sheriff's deputy. When the newcomer families moved into town, it was just the thing Keith needed to cause even more problems. When Tessa befriended them and began standing up to Keith and the other purists in town it seemed to make Keith even more determined to make more trouble. He couldn't seem to understand that Tessa was friends with the newcomers by choice, and he took every opportunity to try to \"save\" Tessa from the aliens. Marlene had been worried with Keith's ever increasing strange behavior and tried to warn her daughter. But in typical Tessa fashion she just blew it off contributing the behavior to his ego being bruised by her rejection combined with his purist views clouding his good judgment. It took the last incident of him physically touching her for Marlene to decide enough was enough and to pick up the phone to call Matt. She knew the safest place her little girl could be was with her big brother the cop. The fact that he lived over 3,000 miles away was an added bonus. After talking to him and 'getting' him to agree she then made her daughter see reason also and three days later after a tearful good-bye loaded her only girl child onto a plane. Now here she was three hours later waiting, waiting to hear from this same child to make sure she had arrived at her destination safe and sound. At about the time she thought she would go crazy from impatience the phone she had put down next to her began to ring. \"Yes mom I'm fine, yes Uncle Matt remembered to pick me up we are on our way to his apartment now, yes mom I'll call you later before I go to bed, I know even with the time change I will call you before I go to sleep, okay love you mom, bye.\" Hanging up she gave a sigh of relief. She loved her mom she really did but her mom tended to go into over protection mode when one of her children were in any type of trouble or extremely far away from home and it sometimes got on her nerves. A small laugh to her right made her turn and look at the man in the driver's seat. Uncle Matt hadn't changed much in the past 6 years. A little gray to his hair maybe, and maybe a few extra pounds but other than that he looked almost exactly the same; same somewhat lanky form, collar length hair and warm brown eyes. Yet one thing that had changed was the happiness and contentment she now saw in those eyes, she had a feeling that his new fiancée Kathy had something to do with that. \"So how ya been doing kiddo?\" Her uncle's warm somewhat coarse voice asked her \"Pretty good Uncle Matt, except you know the reasons why I am out here, other than that things have been good.\" \"How's your dad doing?\" Silence was heard as Tessa paused before answering the seemingly simple question. Her dad, well any question about her dad was anything but simple. Thomas Andrews was a military man with over 20 years in the service. As a kid she had moved numerous times by the time she was 12 living mostly on army bases or sometimes off base in a house nearby. While Tessa loved her dad she also didn't know him very well considering that he had been gone for a majority of her childhood on missions for the U.S. government. Then in 2001 when she had been nineteen 9/11 happened along with the war in Iraq. After that her dad had been shipped out on his first tour. Now years later he was out on yet another tour and doing his parenting over a satellite phone a snippet at a time. He had agreed with her mother that coming to live with Uncle Matt was a good idea. He told her to remember the self defense training he had taught her, told her to be safe and that he loved her and then he had to go. She probably wouldn't hear from him for another month or so. Another month or two of worry to deal with, no biggie she ought to be used to it by now. \"My dad\", she murmured softly \"Last I heard he was doing fine.\" And that was the end of that conversation. The rest of the ride was conducted in strained silence. The only time it was broken was when Matt spoke up halfway through the drive. \"Oh by the way I have to stop at my partners house for a few minutes to update him on a case we're working on, actually this will give ya a chance to meet him, you'll like George he's a good guy, if you like them bald and spotty.\" To be continued…..[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Chapter 2 Sorry its been a whilensince I last updated I would have done it sooner, I had started thisnchapter last week actually but I could only get a paragraph outnbefore my mind blanked and typing words onto the screen was likenpulling teeth. I gave myself a break and when I went back to it afternabout a week the words and ideas came much more easily. Hope younenjoy this installment it is not as good as the first, I am just gladnI finished it. Tessa sighed as shenclimbed into the pull out sofa bed in her uncle's apartment. It hadnbeen a long day and she had never felt so exhausted in her life andnyet she couldn't seem to stop her brain from throwing thoughts atnher which made it quite hard to fall asleep. Her mind kept goingnback to the meeting between her and her uncle's partner George.nMore importantly the meeting between her and her uncle's partnersnson Buck. It had been strange but as soon as they had been introducednshe had felt a connection to the 22 year old newcomer male. She couldntell he felt it too when there eyes met and she could see confusionnin his. As Matt and George went off to talk shop she and Buck madentheir way into the living room taking seats on the couch. \"So you're Matt'snniece?\" Tessa almost laughed at the tension she could feel in thenroom as they tried to make small talk and then after five minutesncomplete silence as their topics for conversation had dwindled awaynto nothing. It was then that Tessa heard the cry of a baby near them.nBoth her and Buck jumped to their feet and made their way to thensmall bassinet near the window. In it lay a small baby newcomerncrying and fussing with displeasure. Tessa bent down and smiled atnthe small bundle. \"Hello little one,nyou are in quite the mood aren't you.\" She leaned over the childnand placed her fists to the baby's temples instantly quieting herndown. \"How did you know tondo that?\" Tessa looked up at the stunned tecktonise malenremembering for the first time that she had an audience. \"Before I left toncome here I knew I needed to study tecktonise culture there was antecktonise family that lived next door to us that I had been friendlynwith they shared with me some of their customs and taught me some ofntheir language. I am defiantly not an expert but I know enough tonlike and respect your people, I'm sorry if I did something wrongnbut the Johnson's, the newcomer family I became friends with, had anson about the same age and I babysat for them at times, they had tonteach me \"the touch\" if I was to care for him.\" Buck bent andnpicked up the baby who by now was cooing and smiling having calmednonce she received \"the touch\" the newcomer way to give andnreceive love and very important in the development of a newcomernchild. \"I am impressed thatnyou learned some of our customs, most humans don't think it isnworth the time to learn anything about our culture they just believenthat we should bend to yours.\" Walking over to him Tessa reached upnand touched his temple with her fist. \"WellnI hope you realize that I'm different from most humans.\" After that the eveningnhad gone by much more smoothly. They had taken turns taking care ofnthe baby, Buck's sister whose name was Vessna, and talking aboutnnewcomer customs and struggles. It turned out they had much in commonnand got along quite well. Tessa snuggled downninto her covers and smiled as she thought of the passionate,nintelligent newcomer male. She had a feeling she had not seen thenlast of him. It had been a monthnsince Tessa had come to live in Las Angeles and she couldn't benhappier. She had found a job as a teacher at the local high schoolnand actually had Buck's younger sister Emily in one of her Historynclasses. She was still living with her Uncle Matt but she would benmoving out soon. Kathy, her uncle's girlfriend, was going to benmoving in with him and she was going to take Kathy's apartment nextndoor. She was getting a good deal on the place as Kathy's leasenwasn't going to be up for the next six months and so she wasnsubletting from her until the lease was up and so was paying thendiscounted rate Kathy had haggled out of the landlord when she hadnmoved in. She also had anwonderful boyfriend, as she and Buck had begun dating only a weeknafter their first meeting. They had been connected from the beginningnand their bond had only continued to grow. Buck was now in the policenacademy following in his dad's footsteps. While both were busy theynalways made time to see each other at least twice a week. She sighed as shenlooked at herself in the mirror making sure her make-up was onnsmoothly and picked up her purse to head out the door. \"Hey where are younrunning off too?\" She turned to face her uncle standing sleepily innthe doorway to his bedroom. He had worked late the night before on ancase and so had been sleeping for most of the day. Tessa looked atnher uncle apologetically. \"Sorry for wakingnyou I was just heading out to meet Buck for dinner and a movie.\"nShe giggled slightly at the annoyed look that crossed his face. Shenknew that when she had first begun dating Buck, Matt had not beennvery happy about it. Mostly because she was like a second daughter tonthe rough around the edges cop and no one would be good enough fornher according to him. Yet over time he had begun to soften, mostly. \"I sure hope hendoesn't eat raw weasel in front of you at dinner.\" \"Uncle Matt you knownas well as I do that newcomers can't digest cooked food, and if Inam to be with him I have to accept his eating habits, still Bucknusually only orders vegetarian meals when we go out, I don't thinknhe wants to upset me by eating raw meat in front of me. Now I amnleaving to go out, I will be back by eleven; we both have to workntomorrow, good night Uncle Matt.\" Smiling down at her he walkednover and placed a light kiss on her forehead. \"Good night Tessa,nand be careful.\" \"Of course UnclenMatt.\" With those final words Tessa left the apartment and made hernway to the lobby where Buck said he would meet her. Afterna nice dinner and a good action movie with plenty of explosions Tessanand Buck found themselves only blocks from Tessa's apartment. \"So wasn't thatnmovie awesome, I love Bruce Willis!\" Bucks arm came around her andnwas laid on her shoulders as they continued their walk to theirndestination. \"I know and youngotta love the scene where he blew up a helicopter by driving a truckninto it.\" \"Yeah no matter hownunrealistic it was, it was one of the coolest scenes in the wholenmovie.\" Tessa's arm moved around his waist, her head going ontonhis shoulder. The couple was soncaught up in each other they never noticed the small group ofnteenagers approaching them from behind. They were covered in tattoosnand clothing declaring their purist beliefs and the sight of annewcomer male with his arms and hands all over a human femaleninfuriated them. There was going to be hell to pay that night and itnwould be up to those involved to determine who would come out thenwinner and who would end up beaten in the street tasting their ownnblood.[Chapter 3] The human male sneerednat the couple ahead of him walking arm in arm. It was disgusting thatn\"creature\" being all over a \"human\" woman. Smirking cruellynhe turned to his cohorts in crime. \"Okay boys letsnteach that slag not to go after our women.\" \"Yeah stupid no goodndirty slag.\" A few more slurs werenuttered helping to pump up the intruders' confidence that and thenalcohol they had consumed earlier in the night. In one quick run onenof the thugs who could have been the leader or the drunkest, which tonthis group could have meant the same thing, charged toward thennewcomer and with a two-by-four he had used before to destroynmailboxes and parking meters he swung at the back of his prey'snbald spotty head. \"Buck!\" Tessa feltnher heartbeat accelerate as she saw the man she loved fall to thenground. Rushing to him she suddenly realized they were not alone. Anyoung guy stood behind them. At first glance he looked normal almostnharmless. He wasn't very tall maybe only 5'7 or 5'8 and wasnthin and lanky as well. His muddy brown hair was shaggy and stringynlike it was in need of a wash. He was dressed in typical teenagenclothing, baggy shorts 3 sizes too big barely being held up by anblack silver studded belt his t-shirt showed off his adoration fornhis favorite heavy metal band and on his feet were a pair of worn outnsneakers drawn on with marker with things like \"f you\" and \"Inlike P----\". Looking at their assailant Tessa was shocked tonrealize that he could have passed as one of her students. The onlynthing on him that looked dangerous was his eyes. They were hard andncold showing no feeling at all. Just looking at them made her shiver.nHe had so much hate in him. A pained groan fromnBuck shook her out of her panic induced shock. Reaching down shentouched her fist to his temple. \"Buck are you okay,nopen your eyes please.\" With another groan his eye lids flutterednthen opened to reveal his beautiful brown orbs. They looked slightlynunfocused but otherwise coherent, thank God. \"Buck hey you reallynhad me wor-\"Before she could finish her sentence she felt herselfnbeing hauled up by a pair of pale forceful hands. At once she begannto struggle trying to remember everything thing her instructor hadnsaid in the rape defense classes she had taken back home. She knewnshe had to get peoples attention and she had always been told if shenwas ever in this type of situation to be as loud as possible.nBreathing in a nice deep breath she let it out in the loudestnpossible scream she could manage. \"HEELLLPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!\"nShe was rearing up to do an encore when one of the hands holding hernclamped down on her mouth. \"Shut the hell up,nwhat do ya think ya doin ya bitch?\" \"Trying to save mynass\" Was the first thought that came through her head not that shencould say anything not alone answer the boys' question. He wasnalready past it anyway as he dragged her closer to Buck who by nownhad gained back most of his senses and was starting to stand up. \"Hey sponge head itnseems me and my fellas crashed your good time\", laughter was heardnfrom the boys peanut gallery behind him, \"well too bad for you butnwe, well you could say we are the unofficial neighborhood watch andnwell what we was watching not too long ago was turning our stomachs.\"nBuck now on his feet saw Tessa in the hands of his assailant, shencould see the anger in his eyes, but she could also see his policentraining kick in. He began assessing the situation deciding what hisnbest move would be. She at once relaxed slightly in her captors arms.nShe needed to get away from the action so that Buck could concentratenfully on defeating their opponents. If she fooled her captor intonthinking she had given up he would let his guard down and hopefullynit would be enough for her to be able to slip away. \"Ya see me and thenguys don't like it when we see such a fine piece of human ass withna dirty slag like you, I mean we have a hard enough time finding goodnhuman women without you guys stealing them from us, so as punishmentnI think I will just have to steal her back, what do ya think boys?\"nA chorus of \"hell ya\", \"awesome\" and shrill whistles followedntheir apparent leaders question. Tessa tried not tonshow her fear as she listened to this thug say he was 'taking'nher back from Buck. It was close to the end of his speech that shenrealized that his hold had loosened enough that if she were quicknenough she should be able to break it and escape. Looking around fromnunder her lashes she bid her time until the perfect moment came tonher. Her captor was distracted from her by his taunting of Buck,nseeing her opportunity Tessa slammed her foot down on his whilensimultaneously slamming her head at his chin, just like herninstructor had taught her. Swearing up a storm her captor let go ofnher for a second as the pain overcame him. As soon as she felt hisnhold loosen she made her move running quickly toward Buck and safety. \"Tessa, you have gotnto listen to me there isn't much time take out your cell phone andncall the police, then stay behind me okay?\" \"Okay but please bencareful and they're only human so try not to kill them?\" With annod of his head he turned back to the now fully assembled gang.nQuickly pulling her cell from her purse Tessa dialed 911 and cursednwhen she was put on hold. That's it she was not going to wait tonget help. Quickly skimming her contacts she found the name she wasnlooking for and pressed the call button. After a few rings a tirednyet wonderfully familiar voice came on the phone. Tessa quicklynexplained their situation and, realizing how close they were to theirnlocation, soon gave a high sigh of relief. Looking to see how Bucknwas faring she smiled as she saw all but the gangs leader on thenpavement out cold. The boy was breathing heavily and sweat seemed tonbe coming off him in waves. Buck on the other hand was completelyncalm and cool; at least that is what it looked like. Tessa knew himnwell enough to tell he was tense, but she also knew he could handlenit. At least she thought he could until his opponent pulled out angun. Just because Buck wasna newcomer didn't mean he was invincible. Guns could hurt or kill antectonise man just as well as a human one and Buck was unarmed. Henwas off duty and so not carrying his weapon. Just when she thoughtnthe bad guy had won a shot rang out and the perpetrator dropped hisnweapon clutching his arm blood now freely flowing from it. Lookingnquickly to see their savior they both smiled in relief andnappreciation. \"Well now that thatnis over who wants a beer and a glass of sour milk?\" Laughing Tessanran over and threw her arms around her hero. \"Uncle Matt thanknGod, I thought you'd never get here!\" As her uncles arms camenaround her she again felt the same safeness she felt when she wasnwith her father. All of sudden she remembered Buck and with a gaspnturned around only to bump into him as if her thoughts had conjurednhim up. She was at once engulfed in his strong embrace. \"Oh Buck I am sonsorry, I should have checked on you first but I saw Uncle Matt and-\" Fists on her templesnstopped her from finishing her sentence. \"Its okay, Inunderstand, now it's been a long night so how about I take you homento get some rest.\" \"Okay.\" Holdingnhands they made their way to Matt's car along the way talking tonGeorge assuring him they were fine. The whole trip back to hernapartment was quiet both had been through so much in just a few hoursnthat they needed time to decompress and figure out why something likenthis had happened. That hate was out there was something they knewnbut to come face to face with it was something all togetherndifferent. Tessa knew that no matter what she wanted to be with Bucknand she also knew that being with him would come with challenges. Shenalso knew, no matter how corny it sounded, that if they were withneach other that they could face anything. Tonight had proved it andnit just made her all the more determined to be happy with the man shenloved. Buck's thoughts werenjumbled and confused but among all this one thing was crystal clear,nhe loved Tessa. No matter what he would always love her, still whennhe thought back to when she was in the arms of that bastard both fearnand anger washed through him. He knew she had been in that situationnbecause she was with him. He didn't want to continue to put her inndanger but he also knew he couldn't stay away. His father hadntalked to him one time about knowing when he would find his perfectnmate. He had asked how he would know if the person he was with wasn'the one'. His father had told him, \"Son, you will know becausenyou will not want to be without them and even if you are separatednthey will always be in your thoughts and your hearts.\" \"Is that how younfeel about mom?\" Touching his fist to Buck's temple he smiled atnhim in a peaceful way. \"Yes and every daynwe were separated on the ship she was always in both my thoughts andnmy hearts so that when we were reunited it was as if I was wholenagain.\" Buck always wanted tonfeel that way about someone but didn't know if he would ever find anperson that would bring about those emotions in him. That was untilnhe had met Tessa. It seemed as though from their first meeting theynwere connected and the bond had just grown stronger through time.nJust like his father had said about his mother Tessa was in hisnthoughts and hearts and no matter how far apart they may be he knewnthey would never be far from each other's minds. Tessa sighed as shenmade her way into her apartment. She smiled as she remembered thensweet goodbye between her and Buck just minutes before. They had bothnexpressed their fears and love for each other. Both had agreed thatneven with the challenges they faced that they would stick them outntogether. They knew they always had her Uncle and Kathy to talk tonbecause they had gone and were going through the same thing. Finallynagreeing to come to his parent's house for dinner the next nightnthey ended their evening with a long sweet kiss. Placing her purse downnon the couch she saw the blinking of her answering machine showing anmessage was waiting for her. Hitting the button she smiled as shenheard her mother's voice come through the machine. She asked hownshe was and how Uncle Matt was doing and then expressed hernexcitement and happiness over her relationship with Buck. Tessanshouldn't have worried about her mom disapproving, She had alwaysnbeen very accepting and besides Buck made her happy which was all hernmother ever wanted for her. She was glad her mom sounded so happy,nshe always worried about her so much all the time. Note to self,nTessa thought; make sure mom never finds out about tonight, I do notnneed for her to worry about something she really cannot control. Thenmessage finally ended with an I love you and call me back later. Asnshe made her way to the bedroom taking off her clothing as she didnthe voice from the next message stopped her in her tracks. \"Hey sweetheart,nthought you could get away from town, away from me and that Inwouldn't find you. I am a cop after all darling, maybe a small townnone, but I was taught the same stuff those big city police know, likenhow to track down a person even if they don't seem to have left antrace. I'm coming up to see you very soon, it has been too long. Ohnif you think your cop uncle will stop me well he doesn't scare me,nyou see everyone is expendable at some point. See ya soonnsweetheart.\" Tessa didn't evennnotice the machine stating that her messages were complete.nStaggering over to the couch she fell onto it her breath ragged hernheart pounding. Keith had found her, not that she had been trying tonhide exactly, but she had never thought he would actually come tonwhere she was. She had assumed that once she had left he would soonnforget about her and move on to someone else. That he hadn't andnhad tracked her down meant that she was more than just an annoyancento him. It meant that he was obsessed; she had an obsessed puristncoming straight toward her. What would he do when he got here? Morenimportantly what would he do when he found out that she was involvednwith a newcomer? Whatever the response she knew one thing: it wasn'tngoing to be good.[Chapter 4] Sorry for the wait, hope you likenit! Also I made up the word Techta, I could not find a tectonisendictionary online, if anyone knows of one please let me know, sonsorry it isn't an original tecton word. Tessa sighed as she drank her secondncup of coffee of the morning. She had hardly slept the night beforentrying to decide what she was going to do about the not so friendlyndeputy. She had been rolling around in her head the idea of tellingnher uncle or Buck but she knew their response would be to lock her innher room. Tessa knew she would hate that, why should she become anprisoner while her tormentor roamed around free as a bird? Still notntelling them would make her feel guilty as hell. She had never liednto Uncle Matt, he had become like a second father to her, and to notntell him the truth would torture her. Buck would be even worse; theynnever kept important things such as this from each other. She knew ifnshe did that their relationship would be forever changed. Her heartnwas heavy with indecision. Finally by the end of breakfast she knewnwhat she had to do. \"He said what!\" The loudness ofnMatt's voice echoed off the silent walls surrounding them. Tessanhad decided to tell her uncle first, it was just her luck howevernthat Buck happened to be over visiting when she arrived. Deciding itnwould be better to 'kill two birds with one stone' she had satndown with them and told them about her 'admirer' from home. Shenhad decided not to have them listen to the message; she didn't needntheir feathers ruffled anymore than they already were. \"Calm down Uncle Matt, Keith hasnalways been full of hot air, I think he was just blowing off steam,nstill I thought I should warn you since he did threaten you just inncase he does decide to show his ugly mug around here.\" Tessa lookednto Buck wondering what he could be thinking. He was being so quietnand controlled it was beyond hard to read anything from him. Slowlynhe raised himself from the chair where he had been sitting and madenhis way over to her. Leaning over her he gently placed his fistnagainst her temple caressing the skin there lovingly. \"Techta (love), I know you, younare trivializing this man and his action, but you also have tonunderstand that we love you and will not let anything happen to you,nyou must promise me if you see this man or if he calls you again thatnyou will tell me or Matt immediately.\" The look in his eyes wasnstrong and she knew he was only asking for a small concession and sonshe agreed quickly. \"Look, Buck and I will look intonthis Keith, see if we can't find any skeletons in his closet like anrap sheet, you are to stay close to home, only go to work and school,nyou go nowhere else unless you are with me, Buck or George,nunderstand?\" Tessa sighed but agreed knowing this was better thannbeing kept safe in her room. Once that was settled the threenseparated each one heading off to their respective jobs and errands.nBuck had offered to drive her to work and while she questioned in hernmind if he was just being nice or overprotective, the idea of havingnsome alone time with him, even if it was in the front of a policencruiser, pushed her decision in Buck's favor and she agreed. The drive to her school was fillednwith small talk both purposely avoiding the topic of that morning'snconversation. For now peace had been made on that front and bothnwere just enjoying each other's company. As they reached theirndestination Buck got out and opened her door for her. \"Why thank you kind sir.\" Tessanquipped as she smiled and placed her hand into his. Once she hadngathered her things they faced each other to say their goodbyes.nTessa felt her heart clench as they parted; she never said anythingnto him but every time Buck left to go on patrol she had much anxietynin her mind and heart. She knew that she would probably always feelnthis way, for both Buck and her Uncle, but that it would be her ownnlittle secret. Both men had more than enough to deal with when theynwere at work they did not need to add on her own worries as well. Sonshe put on a brave face and leaned forward for a quick yet blissfulnkiss. \"See you tonight.\" With a smilenof his own he caressed her cheek lightly. \"See ya later Techta.\" The man was close but hidden enoughnso that those he watched did not know he was there. He watched as thencouple said goodbye with a loving look and kiss. A sneer met his lipsnas theirs touched each others. He could not believe that she hadnlowered herself to be with one of 'them'. Although he didn'tnknow why he should be surprised she had opposed him in defense ofnthat slag family back home. It had been there during their argumentsnthat he had been entranced by her fire and spirit. He had alwaysnthought her to be a beautiful woman but she was even more so when shenwas angry. He had been attracted to her since she had begun to maturenand grow into herself and her body. It wasn't until he saw hernanger and determination however that that attraction began to morphninto something more. And with each rejection she had given him hisnurges grew until all he could think about was her and ways to getnher. He had been enraged when shensuddenly disappeared, not a trace to be found. Her mother had been nonhelp, stubbornly refusing to give information. He could see wherenTessa's fire came from. It had taken some digging, but eventuallynhe had found out that Tessa had an uncle who lived in California, annuncle that was a cop. He knew that if she wanted to go somewhere tonfeel safe what better place than with a cop who was also family. Itndidn't take long to find out where the uncle lived and worked. Henhad almost laughed when he found out this uncle not only had a slagnfor a partner but was also shacked up with one. Guess sponge headnloving ran in the family. He had arrived in town just a couple ofndays before, deciding to do some surveillance before announcing hisnarrival to his prey. What he had found both amused and disgusted him. He found out Tessa had gotten a jobnas a high school teacher and had gotten an apartment in her uncle'snbuilding. It seemed she was settling into life in her new homenincluding having a romance, with a newcomer. When he had first seennthem together he could not believe it. His beautiful spirited Tessanwith a slag? He had felt nauseated as he watched the scum touch andnkiss her. He didn't blame her, she had been brainwashed by hernhippie mother and her newcomer loving uncle. She had been taken in bynthis alien and he was taking advantage of her. He would change that,nand soon she would be coming back home with him where she belonged. As Tessa walked into the buildingnshe shivered slightly feeling as though eyes were on her; lookingnaround she could see no one and yet the feeling refused to leave her.nThe day which had started with so much promise seemed to darken andnTessa couldn't help but wonder what sort of gloom and doom awaitednher at its end. ","Summary":" I know I shouldn't be starting a new fic when I haven't finished my others, but I had inspiration a"},{"Movie":"Alien Nation","Title":"On My Own","Author":"Tajjas","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5308121","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This story picks up about a year after Udara Legacy and focuses mostly on Buck although the other major characters will appear as well. As ages were rather flexible since the Alien Nation movies shot several years after the series finished, I'm summarizing what I'm using for this story— All of the adults (George, Susan, Matt, Cathy, Albert, etc.) are still adults and are in the same jobs and family situations that they were in the series. Of the Francisco kids, Buck is 22 and a police officer, Emily is 16 and a junior in high school, and Vessna (is back) and is 5. Albert and May have a child a few months shy of a year old; as of yet he/she/it hasn't put in an appearance in the story so no name. Minor characters from the series will put in appearances as I need them, and if there's a character here that wasn't in the series, I've probably invented them. --For those of you who are following River of Dreams , it hasn't been abandoned or anything like that. I found that having two primary in-progress stories worked pretty well, especially when I wanted to try a new technique, so I'm thinking about making this my new one now that Children of Man is done. * * * * * Buck looked around the apartment and tried not to sigh. It wasn't any worse than any of the dozen other apartments he'd looked at today, but it wasn't really any better, either. He knew what his parents would say—were going to say—when he told them he was looking for a place of his own: he had a perfectly good room at home, and why would he want to go somewhere where he had to pay for his own utilities and food and everything else? They both seemed to miss the fact that he was twenty-two years old, with a steady job that he'd held for over six months, and it was past time that he had some independence. He surveyed the room again and tried not to shake his head. Unfortunately said steady job wasn't exactly the best- paying in the world, especially since he was only a rookie on the force, which kind of limited his options. \"Well?\" Eric prompted. Buck had met the landlord through one of the dispatchers at the station; he was Michelle's uncle, or something like that, he thought. Human, quite a bit older…so far he seemed like a decent guy, if a bit harried. And at least he hadn't lied and claimed that the apartment was in 'like new' condition like one of the other landlords he talked to had. That place hadn't been in 'like new' condition since the fifties. If then. He took another look around, trying to imagine the place with some area rugs and some art on the walls. He could probably make it work. This neighborhood was marginally better than most of the rest he'd looked in, at least, although he could already hear his parents fussing about it the first time they came over. He pushed that thought firmly out of his mind. He was an adult; this was his decision. So the neighborhood was tolerable, and if the apartment wasn't in the best shape, that had been true of just about everything he'd looked at. Here he had a little more square footage without a major difference in rent. And being on the ground floor wasn't so awful, especially considering what he could see of the staircase. \"I've got plans to renovate the whole building in the next few years,\" Eric continued when he didn't respond immediately. \"At the moment work is being done on one of the other apartments, but if you're interested, you could take this one now with the option to move when it's finished.\" He shrugged slightly. \"This one will be renovated too, but probably not until sometime next year.\" Buck paused a moment and then nodded. \"You said you'd need a security deposit and the first month's rent?\" Not that he was sure what the point of a security deposit was, given that most of the walls were already banged up, the linoleum on the floors was torn and stained, and so forth, but…. \"That's right. Do you know when you'd like to move in?\" He sighed again, audibly this time. Telling his parents probably wasn't going to be a pleasant experience, but it would be better just to get it over with. \"It's Tuesday now…could I pick up the keys Friday afternoon?\" He wasn't working this weekend, so he'd be able to get his clothes and things moved from the house, maybe pick up a few more pieces of furniture…. He took another quick look around, making a mental note of things he might want to purchase. The appliances and major pieces of furniture—a table and chairs and a pull-out couch for the combined living and kitchen area, as well as a bed and dresser for the single bedroom—were already here, but a couple more chairs would be nice. That, and new covers for all the upholstered furniture, because it was all in approximately the same state as the rest of the apartment. No mold—he'd have smelled that—but it had probably gone out of date twenty years before they'd crashed on this planet. If Eric hadn't demonstrated that all of the appliances worked, he probably wouldn't have believed it. After that…well, he'd have to pick up food, obviously, he'd get books and radio from the house but maybe he could find a cheap television if somewhere— \"Friday's fine,\" Eric said, interrupting his thoughts. \"You can drop off a check when you pick up the keys and sign all the paperwork then.\" Buck nodded, offering a hand. \"That'll be great. Thanks a lot.\" \"No problem. If you have any trouble with the apartment, the super lives in Apartment One, right next door. That's also where the first renovation is being done, so if you'd like to take a look at what the plans are for this one, go ahead and drop by.\" \"I will, thanks.\" That might at least help appease his parents. * * * * * \"You're late, and the sarge is pissed,\" Cliff greeted with a grin. Buck rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, that's new.\" The bus between the apartment and the station had been running late—not exactly unusual—but the sarge would have been pissed even if he'd been here fifteen minutes early. It seemed to be his permanent state of being. \"Any word from above?\" According to rumor, all rookie pairs that had been formed while the department was shorthanded were slowly being broken up and paired with more 'experienced' officers, with the idea that they'd stay in the new partnerships for at least two years while they gained experience. Thinking about it, it made some sense, but Buck could help but hope that if the rumor was true they'd keep overlooking him and Cliff. Sure, the guy could be a pain in the ass on occasion, but he was also rapidly becoming one of Buck's best friends. And Buck would be the first to admit that he wasn't usually one to make friends quickly. \"Haven't heard anything yet.\" Cliff tucked his gun into its holster and stood up, grabbing his keys off the desk. \"So how goes the apartment hunt?\" \"Well, I've got a place. I'm supposed to move in this weekend...figure that gives me a couple days to work on breaking the news to my parents.\" \"Have fun with that.\" Cliff climbed in on the driver's side, waiting until Buck buckled himself in before starting the car. \"When I told my dad I was moving out, I got like a three hour lecture on how in traditional Tenctonese society, children remained with their parents until they were ready to marry. And then they often moved in with the male's family until their first child was born.\" He shook his head. \"I mean, I do understand that it's important to know our traditions, but I'm not going to live my life ruled by how people were living on a different planet a hundred years ago.\" Buck shrugged. He was pretty sure his parents wouldn't play the 'tradition' card—he was typically the most observant in the family, and even he thought that remaining at home until he decided to get married was kind of ridiculous—but when it came to keeping he and Emily and Vessna close, it was hard to say. \"When are you going to tell them?\" \"I'll probably bring it up tonight. That way they'll have a couple days to get used to it before I actually leave.\" Not that he thought that he'd get a moment's peace in those couple days, but he couldn't just leave one day and not come back. \"So where's your apartment?\" \"Fifth and Lex. Closer to the station, at least.\" \"And it's not the worst neighborhood.\" \"Yeah, thanks, that's helpful. The neighborhood is something I'm just not going to bring up when I talk about the place. And I'll try and keep them away from it for at least a couple days while I get it fixed up a little. Which reminds me—do you have some time this weekend to help me get my stuff in?\" \"Always thrilled to help move heavy objects.\" * * * * * If you have a minute to click the review button and let me know what you think, it would be appreciated.[Chapter 2] Recognizable characters probably aren't mine. * * * * * Susan checked the clock and sighed. Too late to make it to Vessna's open house, but at least she'd be home before her baby was in bed. She navigated through the traffic—not so heavy at this time of night, at least—almost automatically. It wasn't that she didn't appreciate the confidence that the senior partners at the ad agency had in her, but an international project of this size required so much of her time outside normal working hours…. She sighed again. George had spent almost a year on the night shift when Emily had been Vessna's age, and she remembered how he'd worried that he was missing her childhood. Now she was starting to feel the same way. George's car wasn't in the driveway when she got home, but he and Vessna might have stopped somewhere for a snack. \"Hello, Em,\" she greeted her oldest daughter as she walked in the door. Emily grunted something from her reclining position on the couch, her nose buried in a book, that might have been a greeting, and Susan shook her head. Buck was the more studious one, but when Emily focused on something, she focused . \"Is you brother home yet?\" One shoulder twitched. \"Got in ten or twenty minutes ago. He's taking a shower.\" \"Ah.\" Susan couldn't hear the water running, but— \"Hey, Mom,\" Buck greeted, coming down the stairs to join her. He was in the shorts and t-shirt he preferred to sleep in rather than his uniform, and Susan couldn't help but be a little grateful. Six months after his graduation from the police academy she'd finally become at least accustomed to seeing him dressed as a police officer, but she still couldn't bring herself to like it. She knew as well as anyone what this city could be like. He knuckled her temple lightly, and she returned the gesture and smiled. \"Hello. Emily said you just got in. Have you eaten?\" \"Not yet, but I was going to go make myself a plate. Do you want me to make you one too?\" \"That would be wonderful. I'm just going to go get changed.\" She heard him asking Emily if she wanted something to eat too, but when she came back down Emily hadn't moved from her position on the couch so apparently she hadn't been interested. Buck was in the kitchen at the table, two plates set out, and for a moment she thought she saw something slightly…awkward…in his expression. It disappeared as soon as he saw her, though, and with a shake of her head she decided to blame the impression on her own exhaustion. \"So, how was your meeting?\" he asked, starting in on the weasel chunks. \"About like usual. A lot of arguing and then re-agreeing to everything they already agreed to last week.\" There were times when she thought that each client should get a limited number of words per subject, and after that they weren't allowed to talk any more. \"How was your day?\" \"Pretty good. I, um….\" The awkwardness returned to his expression, and this time she knew that she wasn't imagining it. \"You know, I was thinking, it's not really convenient to take the bus down to the station every day and then either taking it back or having Cliff drop me off in the evenings. I mean, it's out of his way, and the bus wastes a lot of time.\" Susan nodded, unable to deny it. For awhile she and George had shared one car between them, with the one who didn't have the car on a given day taking the bus, but shortly after she'd accepted her job at the ad agency they'd had to give in and buy a second vehicle. \"You're thinking about getting your own car, then?\" It was probably a good idea, although who knew where they were going to put it. They already had hers and George's, and the garage was so full of junk there was no way they could fit a car in there…well, they'd figure something out. The initial expense might be difficult for him to handle though; maybe that's why he'd been so hesitant to bring it up. He shook his head. \"Not exactly. I mean, half the problem is the traffic, and having my own car won't fix that.\" He'd been assigned to a precinct on almost the opposite side of the city, and she nodded in understanding. \"Do you think you could transfer to another precinct?\" She knew she'd feel better if he was closer to George, although she wasn't about to bring it up. \"Probably not. Actually, um, I was thinking about maybe getting an apartment closer to the station.\" He blurted the last out so fast that it took her a moment to process the words, and then her hearts seemed to stop for a moment. \"You're leaving?\" \"It's not—I'm not leaving . I mean, I'll still be in the city, and I'll still probably be home most nights for dinner, but it just seems like it would be more convenient if I actually lived closer to the station.\" \" Convenient? \" She heard her voice rise sharply, and a part of her knew that she was overreacting to what really shouldn't be a major event, but she couldn't help it. They'd lost him once, on the ship, and it had been a miracle that they'd gotten him back again. She hadn't even been there the day they'd taken him away; she'd simply come back from a work shift to find George clinging to Emily and absolutely inconsolable, her ten year old son nowhere to be found. And even if this was a completely different situation, even if he was still in the city, he wouldn't be here . Here where she could check on him, make sure that he was safe, on the nights when the nightmares still came. A squeal jolted her out of her train of thought, and Vessna flung herself across the kitchen into her brother's lap. Buck scooped her up, obviously glad of the distraction. \"Hello, Neemu,\" George greeted, coming in behind Vessna. She didn't respond—she couldn't respond—and he touched her temples lightly. \"Suse? What's wrong?\" \"Your son wants to move out.\" \"What?\" George looked at her for a moment, and then lifted his head to stare at Buck. \"You're leaving?\" \"I'm not leaving ,\" Buck repeated. \"It's just—I found an apartment closer to the station. It's not like I'll never be home or anything like that, I just think it'll be easier than fighting the traffic and everything every day. Plus, with me gone, you can move Vessna up into my room and actually have a spare room for all your stuff again, instead of letting it all pile up in the garage.\" \"You already found an apartment?\" Susan demanded. Bad enough thinking about the idea in the abstract, but if he already had a place…. \"I'm supposed to pick up the keys this weekend,\" he admitted after a minute. \"It's like twenty minutes away; it's really not a big deal.\" \"You're leaving?\" Vessna asked, obviously picking up on the important part of the conversation. \"But I don't want you to leave.\" \"What's going on?\" Emily asked, joining the rest of them in the kitchen. \"Is Buck going somewhere?\" \"I found an apartment closer to the station.\" \"Oh. Is that all?\" All? Well, Emily had grown up on this world and probably didn't even remember being split up on the ship; there was no way she could understand how this felt to her parents. Or to her mother, at least…George's face was blank, and it was hard to tell what he was thinking. \"But what will you eat?\" she couldn't help asking. \"What about utilities? And laundry?\" \"I can cook,\" Buck pointed out. \"And the apartment has water and electric. And I'll take my clothes to a Laundromat, like everyone else in the city without a washing machine does.\" Perfectly reasonable answers, but she shook her head anyway. \"Well, how much are utilities?\" George asked, and she couldn't help but be grateful for the support. \"It could be expensive, you know. Are you near a bus stop?\" \"There's one about two blocks away, and utilities are included in the rent.\" \"What about furniture?\" Emily asked. \"I am not helping you haul your bed down out of your room. Do you remember how much work it was to get it up there? And that was with the guys from the moving company helping us.\" \"The big furniture is included, the only thing I really need are a few more chairs and some pillows and stuff.\" He sighed. \"Look, like I said, I'm supposed to pick up the keys this weekend. I'll take you all over and you can see it then, all right? Maybe Sunday?\" Susan shook her head, pushing her chair back from the table. She'd barely touched the plate that Buck had made for her, but the way she felt right now there was no way she'd be able to manage even a single bite more. She needed to… process …as Elena always said. \"I'm going to take a shower. Excuse me.\"[Chapter 3] Warning for language (Sal is a little less polite than either Buck or his mother is). If you like the story and have the time, please review. * * * * * Sal: Broken Broken. Broken, broken, broken. Everything in this damn building was broken . Just once she'd like to get a call where the problem was that the tenant had forgotten to plug something in. What in the hell had she been thinking when she'd agreed to be the super here? She swiped at her forehead, tucking back the wisps of hair that had escaped her bandana, and sighed. Well, actually she'd been thinking that she'd needed money and a place to sleep that wasn't a shelter, and Eric was a decent enough guy as far as landlords went, but she hadn't counted on this much work beyond the actual renovations he'd wanted done. \"Well?\" the woman—Sherry?...Cherry?...that was it, Cherry Pitts, courtesy of some jackass at Immigration—prompted. \"Can you fix it?\" \"I can, but I'm going to have to swing by the hardware store and pick some caulk first. I know you said you had to work this afternoon…if you'd rather I wait until you're here until I do the work, I can do it tomorrow morning. Otherwise I should have it done before you get off shift.\" Technically it said in all the tenants' leases that the super had the right to enter their apartments at any time if there was work to be done, but there was no sense kicking up bad feelings about. It wasn't as though there weren't ten other things that she could do before she had to go into the shop. \"Do it whenever you can; I just want it done. I can barely sleep for hearing the traffic out there.\" Privately Sal doubted that fixing the window casing—which was a mess—would really do that much for the noise, but she nodded sympathetically. \"All right, then, I'll get right on it.\" \"Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" She took the stairs quickly, headed for her bike, and then doubled back to her apartment. As long as she was going to the hardware store, she might as well pick up the remaining things she needed to get the kitchen cabinets in her apartment re-hung. That was the other good thing about working for Eric; he'd known when he bought it what a mess this building was and wasn't being idiotic about the renovation budget. It was small—it had to be, given the neighborhood—but not totally unreasonable. For the most part. It didn't actually take long to re-caulk the window, and patch a few cracks in Cherry's walls besides, but by the time she finished she had to hurry to be at the shop on time. Dade had been a little pissed at how she'd taken off before without any word, but she was damn good at engine work and he knew it so he'd been willing to let her come back. It had been a harder fight to keep it under thirty hours a week, just so she could keep her deal with Eric and keep renovating that damn apartment building at the same time. She snorted to herself. Then again, a good part of that might have been play-acting for salary negotiation—she got as much done working part time after hours as she would working full time during the day if she had to deal with customers. And this way the chances of her offending any customers the way she had when she'd worked here back in high school were much, much lower. The alley behind the shop was barely big enough for passage, but she took it out of habit, kicking a scrap of metal ahead of her. Of course part-time meant no insurance, which was probably not smart considering the kind of shit she was dealing with on a daily basis, but there was no way in hell she could hold down two full time jobs. Besides which, she was practically a walking preexisting condition anyway. Maybe when the renovations were done and the building wasn't a full time job anymore she'd see what was available, but…. \"Yeah, that'll be the day,\" she muttered. \"When I'm about fifty .\" \"Hey,\" Luke greeted as she walked in. \"What happened to you?\" Like she was going to waste time showering to get the drywall dust off when she was going to end up covered in grease anyway. She rolled her eyes. \"Drywall. What's your excuse?\" \"You're funny, really. Take the 'vette.\" * * * * * Eric was waiting for her in the hallway outside her apartment when she finally got off work, and she grinned and raised a hand in greeting. \"Hey, what's up? Come to complain about the credit card bill? Or is something broken in your apartment too?\" He didn't live in this building, but there had already been 'a couple things' that he'd asked her to take a look at. \"Nothing like that. Not today, anyway. Just wanted to let you know that you're going to be getting a new neighbor Friday.\" He indicated the currently-empty apartment next to the one she was currently renovating. \"Huh.\" It was a single-bedroom, damn near the mirror of hers from what she remembered. She hadn't been in the place since she'd done a quick survey of the building, mostly because there hadn't been anyone living there to complain about what was wrong with it. \"He's a cop, so whichever of your supplies are stolen, keep them out of sight, all right?\" \"No faith. No faith at all.\" Some of her tools had been acquired through methods that the IRS probably wouldn't approve of, but she wasn't sloppy enough to actually steal anything outright. \"Is he the party sort?\" She hoped not…she didn't get much sleep as it was, and a noisy neighbor wouldn't help. Pissing off the building's super would be a pretty dumb thing for a new tenant to do, but God knew there were plenty of dumb people out there. \"Nah, don't think so. He's a young guy—probably about your age—but he seemed pretty serious.\" \"That's something, I guess. There anything he's going to need right off?\" Eric shrugged. \"All the lights and faucets worked when I gave him a tour of the place, but beyond that I don't know. Didn't you make notes on all the apartments when you first moved in?\" \"Yeah, guess I should go dig those up.\" With her luck, half the outlets were dead and there was a rat colony living behind the shower. \"You said Friday?\" \"That's when he's picking up the keys.\" \"I'll see what I can get done beforehand.\" \"Thanks. And let me know before you order the new flooring for your place so I'm ready for the bill.\" \"Sure, but it'll be a couple weeks. I've still got kitchen cabinets to shim into place, plumbing to move in the bathroom, and all the painting to do. Which reminds me, did you want to pick paint colors, or should I just pick something?\" \"Pick something,\" he said with a shrug. \"Uh—something neutral, please.\" \"No worries.\" She might like bright colors, but neon green walls would bother even her. \"Can generally find some version of tan or cream on sale.\" He nodded. \"Thanks, Sal. Let me know if you need anything else.\" She nodded, keeping her comment 'two more hands and an extra four hours a day, to herself, and headed into her apartment. \"List, list, where the hell did I put that list?\" The tape player was on the kitchen counter—or at least on the board that would be replaced with a kitchen counter at some point in the future—and the mini recorder was in her pocket, but where she'd put her box of tapes…. \"Ah.\" The tape crackled ominously as she fast-forwarded through a recitation of things to do for several other apartments, and she made a mental note to pick up a new pack of cassettes the next time they were on sale. Well, or spend real money to invest in new technology, but the way her budget looked, that wasn't going to be happening anytime soon. \"—ne B,\" she heard her own voice say the next time she stopped the tape, and she did a quick rewind and started it again. \"-next stop, apartment One B. Which apparently needs a new lock. Is there any apartment in this building that isn't a piece of crap?\" She'd replaced the lock—actually all the apartment locks—immediately after moving in, so she ignored that note. And the fairly rhetorical question. \"Huh. Better shape than most of them, I guess,\" the voice on the tape continued, obviously stepping into the apartment. \"Most of the stuffing is still in the furniture, anyway. Need to replace the flooring and patch the walls, same as everywhere else. Oh, big hole by the electrical panel that needs to be taken care of. Can just see some idiot sticking his hand in and electrocuting himself.\" \"Hole by the electrical panel,\" Sal said into the smaller tape recorder. \"Faucets look all right—well, actually they look like crap, but at least they work —hot water's okay, cold water's okay, decent water pressure. Need to pin down the linoleum between the hall in the bedroom before someone trips.\" \"Linoleum,\" she said into the tape recorder. \"Windows are in pretty good shape, actually—course the bars on the outside probably helped with that. Safety releases w—ow! Safety releases are rusty, and it's a good thing I just had a tetanus shot, but they seem to work.\" \"Clean or replace the safety releases on the windows,\" Sal noted. Just to be safe. She hadn't asked whether the new tenant was human or Newcomer…the worst a Newcomer would get was a scratched hand, but a human could end up in the hospital if he wasn't up-to-date on his shots. There wasn't much else on the tape…only two dead outlets and no rat colony, which despite the amount of work she'd done to kill the things off without poisoning anyone else in the building, she'd more than half expected. There were a couple comments on the tape about fixing up the kitchen cabinets, but that was about on par with the paint and the linoleum. All of the apartments needed that. So hopefully she could get the repairs that needed doing done tomorrow morning. \"And then wait for the complaints to start once the guy moves in,\" she muttered, and then shut the tape player and recorder off and headed for the shower. If she hurried, she could probably get the windows here re-caulked as well before she fell asleep.[Chapter 4] Thanks to everyone who is reading…if you have a moment, click the review button and tell me what you think. * * * * * Cliff: An Incident \"Hey, Buck, do you have a screwdriver?\" The screws to hold the shelves in place had been very carefully taped to the inside of the bookcase frame, but he'd looked through just about every box they'd hauled over from Buck's parents' place, and he still couldn't find any tools to actually do the assembly. \"Um…somewhere, I think.\" Most of Buck's attention was focused on the couch cover as he tried to figure out how it was supposed to go on, and Cliff did a quick glance around the room. A dozen or so boxes that he'd already looked through, some fairly dilapidated furniture that had been here when they'd arrived…. \"Didn't you say the super lived next door?\" Shelly asked, looking up from the box of food she putting away in the cabinets. \"Maybe he has one you can borrow. Uh, Buck, I think you're doing that backwards. Look, the seams are showing.\" Cliff nodded, although neither was looking at him, and headed back into the hall. There were two doors, one next to Buck's and one on the other side of the hall. He shrugged and knocked on the one next to Buck's. \"Just a minute!\" a woman called, followed by the sound of something heavy moving, and then the door finally opened. \"Sorry about that. Can I help you with something?\" He stared for a moment at the scar creasing the right side of her face from temple to chin and then realized what he was doing and shook himself. \"Uh, sorry. I was looking for the building superintendent?\" \"You're looking at her. What can I do for—\" her eyes caught the badge clipped to his belt, and she smiled. \"Oh, you must be my new neighbor. Eric said you picked up the keys yesterday. I'm Sal. It's nice to meet you.\" \"Cliff,\" he returned, shaking her hand automatically. \"And actually my partner is your new neighbor; I'm just helping him move in. We're trying to put some bookshelves together, but I'm not sure which box the screwdriver ended up in. Or if it's even in one, for that matter. I was kind of hoping that you might have one that I could borrow.\" She grinned. \"Yeah, sure, I know how the whole moving thing tends to go. What kind do you need?\" \"Phillips head. Uh…medium-sized, I guess.\" \"Just a sec.\" She disappeared inside, only to return a minute later. \"Here. Multiple heads, just twist open the handle and pick out which one you want. They're magnetic so once they're in the slot they'll hold until you pull them out.\" She glanced back into the apartment again. \"I'd offer to help, but I've really got to get to work. Just tell your partner to return it when he's done.\" She grinned again and then shrugged slightly. \"Figure I can probably trust a couple cops not to steal my stuff.\" Cliff smiled as well, taking the screwdriver. \"Yeah, that's a fair assumption. Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" She didn't even go back into the apartment, pulling the door shut behind her and locking it before tucking the key into her pocket and hurrying off down the hall. \"You find him?\" Shelly asked when he came back in. She was still stocking the cabinets, but Buck had apparently figured out the couch cover and had moved on to re-covering the chairs he'd picked up at some yard sale. \"Her, actually. Human, pretty young to be a super, but she seemed nice enough.\" At least she didn't seem to have a problem with him being Tenctonese, even when she'd thought he was her neighbor. Things weren't as bad as they'd been a few years ago, but there was still plenty of prejudice to go around. He held up the screwdriver. \"You're supposed to return it when we're done with it.\" \"Hm?\" Buck glanced up with a frown and then nodded quickly. \"Oh, yeah, sure.\" \"That's different,\" Shelly said, dismantling the box the food had been in and standing up. \"You don't see too many female superintendents.\" He shrugged. \"She had a screwdriver, at least. Although I guess she works somewhere else too—said she was in a hurry.\" \"Maybe that's why this place is such a mess.\" Buck tugged the last chair cover into place and then surveyed the room. \"Mom and Dad want to come by tomorrow…I want it to look decent, but I'm not sure what else to do.\" \"A coat of paint and a new floor would be nice,\" Shelly said. \"Barring that…I don't know. Try and hang your artwork so it covers the really big cracks.\" Cliff snorted, looking around the room. \"I don't think you have enough artwork.\" The furniture covers had been a good start, but in a way they almost accentuated the rest of the things that still needed to be done. Granted that most of the major work was cosmetic—no mold, no apparent infestations, and the building's collapse didn't seem eminent—but there was enough of it to take a normal person a year to complete. \"You're hilarious, both of you. Cliff, try putting those bookshelves over here. That'll hide the linoleum, or lack thereof, and the wall.\" He looked at the counter top—stained and burned in several places—and shook his head. \"I know I grabbed a couple decorative plates from that estate sale…think I wrapped them in the area rugs.\" Buck would think of decorative plates, Cliff decided with a shake of his head, hauling the bookshelf to where his partner had indicated. They were a pretty good team, but he tended to be more impulsive whereas Buck would plan out everything to be done a week and a half in advance if he could. Cliff was a little surprised that he had moved on an apartment as fast as he had, actually…he'd expected the guy to be making lists for a month before he got around to moving out of his parents' place. \"All units in the vicinity of Twelfth and Roberts, requesting backup for a possible robbery at a convenience store,\" the radio on Shelly's belt squawked suddenly, interrupting his thoughts. \"Two-seven-Thomas-two-five responding,\" she said immediately as the radio went silent, echoed by several other familiar radio signatures. Cliff glanced at Buck, who nodded quickly. They were off today, technically, but if Shelly was rolling, especially without a partner, they were too. Both patrol cars were parked just down the block, and the three of them arrived at the scene at the same time another patrol car did. They were waved off almost immediately for crowd-control duty—rookies usually were—and there was the usual hassle with pushing people back as they tried for the best view of what was going on. He still didn't understand why; if someone had a gun and it wasn't his job to keep people from getting hurt, he'd damn well have the sense to stay away. But they obviously didn't, and—\"Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you need to stay back right now,\" he said firmly, planting himself in front of a woman who'd just ducked under the police tape. \"But I'm late picking my son up from the babysitter, and I need a jug of milk.\" \"I'm sorry, but you'll need to pick that up somewhere else.\" People worried him, sometimes. * * * * * \"Hello? Is anyone home?\" \"In here!\" Mona called cheerfully from the kitchen. \"Did you get Buck all moved in? I stopped by the apartment after work, but no one was there.\" He joined her, knuckling temple lightly. \"Mostly. He's still got a few boxes to unpack and some decorating to do.\" Or at least some creative hiding of flaws. \"There was an…incident…and we had to spend a good portion of the afternoon filling out paperwork.\" He hated officer-involved shootings. Hastings hadn't had a choice, not when the would-be robber had threatened to shoot the three people who'd been trapped in the convenience store when he'd tried robbing it, but they were still hard on everybody. Mona leaned back against him lightly but didn't ask any questions. They'd been seriously dating for about a year, and she knew well enough by now that she didn't want to know the details. Any more than he wanted to tell her.[Chapter 5] Thanks to everyonenwho is reading. If you have a moment, click the review button andntell me what you think. * * n * * * Buck: Long Time \"Well, this is it.\" Emily was the first in,nwrinkling her nose at the linoleum on the floor. \"Haven't theynever heard of carpet?\" \"This was probablyneasier to clean.\" Mom didn't sound particularly thrilled aboutnthat fact, but at least she wasn't lifting any of the area rugsnhe'd put down to look under them as she prowled around the place. \"Are you certain thatnthis building is structurally sound?\" Dad asked, poking at one ofnthe cracks in the wall that he hadn't quite had enough posters ornartwork to cover. \"It's fromnsettling. The landlord said the whole building is scheduled to benrenovated, but this apartment isn't one of the first ones on thenlist. The one next door is, though…if I want to move into thatnwhen it's done, I have the option.\" \"Hm.\" His motherndid lift one of the decorative plates he'd put down on the counter,nfrowning at the burn spots underneath. \"That doesn't seem verynsafe.\" \"Whoever lived herenbefore probably set a pan down without putting a potholder downnfirst. Eric demoed all of the appliances when I was looking at thenplace, and they were all working fine.\" \"You're hardly anmechanic,\" his father pointed out. Buck forced himself notnto roll his eyes. He wasn't a mechanic, true enough, but he couldnsee flames and smell smoke as easily as anyone else. \"The supernlives right next door. I'm sure if I have any problemsnhe'll—she'll—\" he amended, remembering what Cliff hadnsaid—\"be happy to help.\" \"Considering the jobnthat's been done keeping up the rest of this place, I wouldn't benso sure.\" He glared at Emily. nShe was the only one in the family who didn't seem to benoverreacting to his impending move, and he needed a little backup onnthis. Not that she was entirely happy that he was moving out, but atnleast it wasn't a total freak out like his parents and Vessna werenhaving either. Of course, Vessna was only six, and to be fair acrossnthe city probably did feel like across the world to her, butnhe'd thought his parents would have come to terms with things anlittle better by now. He shook his head. Atnfirst it had seemed like Dad had been okay with it, but now everyntime Buck turned around he was coming up with one more little thingnthat could go wrong, and 'shouldn't you think about this a littlenmore?' He'd given up pointing out that he had thoughtnabout it and was just ignoring the whole mess. Of course, then Momnlooked at him and sighed, which was harder to ignore. * * n * * * Buck looked around thenapartment and shook his head. It had the official parental stamp ofnapproval now—albeit not without considerable reservations, and henhad a mental list of things he wanted to do before the next time theynsaw this place—but he couldn't help but feel a little guiltynabout it. Mom and Dad just looked so miserable …he knew henwas doing the right thing, but he still hated upsetting them. With ansigh, he grabbed the screwdriver off the countertop and headed fornthe door. He'd forgotten to return it before he caught the busnyesterday, and it would probably be a bad idea to irritate the supernwhen he already knew he was going to have to ask for things to bendone. If he concentrated, hencould hear some sort of power tool running next door, so she must benaround…. He knocked on the door, and then knocked again, harder,nwhen there was no immediate response. Cliff had said that she wasnhuman. The sound of the power tool ceased, and a moment later thendoor opened to reveal a human woman about his age. \"Hello, can I h—\"n She broke off, frowning. \" Buck? \" Buck stared at thenwoman in front of him. For a moment he didn't recognize her—hendidn't spend a lot of time around human females, and none of thenones he did spend time with had scars down the sides of theirnfaces—but when he looked past the scar to the sharp features….n\" Sal? \" It was hard to tell under the layer of dust, andnmost of her hair was tied back under a bandana, but the too-pale blueneyes matched what he remembered. \"Hey,\" she saidnwith a laugh he would have recognized even without the visual clues. n\"Seriously long time no see.\" He shook his head,ntrying to process. They'd been friends, of a sort, back in highnschool, but it had been more a case of outcasts sticking togethernthan anything in particular they had in common. They'd eaten lunchntogether fairly often, since she never seemed to mind the things he'dnbrought, but he'd talked about literature and politics and currentnevents while she'd talked about engines and cars and constructionnprojects. When he'd finally started making friends among the othernstudents in his advanced classes, they'd stopped spending as muchntime together. He'd never been surenwhat had happened to her…her disappearance had coincided with Momnand Emily ending up in the hospital, and he hadn't even noticed atnfirst. That had been partly because they had stopped eating lunchntogether all the time—and she'd always been an indifferentnstudent so there was never a guarantee that she'd show up on anyngiven day, anyway—but it was also partly because he hadn't reallynwanted anything to do with any Terts just then. It hadn'tnbeen until a few weeks later, after Mom and Em had recovered, that henrealized that he hadn't seen her for quite awhile. And since henhadn't even known where she lived, he hadn't had any idea wherento start looking. \"Hey,\" he finally managed. \"I— you're the super here?\" \"For my sins.\" Shennodded at the screwdriver he held. \"So are you my new neighbor, ornare you just helping this phantom person move in?\" \"Neighbor,\" hensaid, offering it. \"Thanks.\" She took it and tuckednit into her tool belt. \"No problem; I know how the moving thingngoes. I'd have offered to help, but I was already running late.\" \"Yeah, that's whatnCliff said.\" She crossed her armsnover her chest and leaned against the doorframe. \"So you're ancop, huh? That would not have been my first thought.\" \"Wasn't reallynmine, either.\" His mind ran through the collection of the classesnat the community college, lessons at the temple, and a dozen othernthings he'd tried before it finally occurred to him to try thenacademy before he shrugged. \"It just sort of worked.\" \"As long as you'renhappy, I guess.\" \"What happened tonyou? Back in high school, I mean. If you don't mind. You justnsort of disappeared.\" Her face darkenednslightly. \"Yeah. Dad and I really got into it one night and…Indon't know. I just couldn't take it any more. Packed mynbackpack, grabbed my bike, and left.\" \"Where'd you go?\" \"Anywhere. nEverywhere. Name a major city in the US—and a couple in Canada andnMexico—and I've probably been there. Was never any good at thenschool shit, but there's damn near nothing mechanical I can'tnfigure out, so I'd get somewhere, find work for a month or two, andnthen move on again. Ended up back here a few months ago and heardnabout Eric buying this place and looking for someone to fix it up,nso…here I am.\" She shrugged. \"Aside from the sheer amount of stuff to do, it's working out pretty well.\" \"Hey, Sal?\" a humannboy, probably ten or twelve, stuck his head over the railing. \"Mamansaid to tell you the bathroom sink is leaking again!\" \"Speaking of,\" shenmuttered, and then lifted her head. \"I'll be there in a minute,nDanny.\" She turned back to Buck. \"I better go deal with thatnbefore it does any more damage to the cabinet, but if you neednanything—or if anything blows up—let me know. I've gotneverything critical taken care of at this point, so I can probablynget to it in a reasonable amount of time.\" \"Thanks.\" He shook his head,nturning back for his own apartment as she pulled her door shut andnlocked it behind her. Of all the people to run into.

Find out now. ( this might be a bit different from the real thing) Bpov Chapter 1 Edward and I were waiting in the kitchen for my birthday party to begin. \"why is he doing this to me?\" I thought. \" he knows I hate parties. Especially ones for me.\" \"what are you thinking, Bella?\" Edward asked, redirecting my thoughts. I smiled at him and answered as truthfully as I could. \"well I wanna know what exactly is going down there.\" this answer slowly turned into a moan. Edward grinned at me \"you'll find out soon enough\" which basically told me I had no way out of this. I had to go along with it. I still don't understand how this beautiful creature could want someone as normal and as accident prone as me. But before I could think about it again, Edward pulled me into a close hug and I smiled. This was my happy place. I could just stay here all night if I wanted to. Already in my happy place, I closed my eyes. And that was when I felt cool arms, pulling me away from my only love. \"Come on Bella, it's time!\" Alice squealed. \"God, Alice I'm coming, I'm coming\" I heard Edward chuckle behind me as we walked down the stairs and into their huge living room. A gasp escaped my mouth when I saw all the trouble the Cullen's have made, just for my party. There were candles everywhere, and all the Cullen's were dressed up, even Edward. I had to promise Alice that I would where the dress she gave me to the party. And so I did. I blushed as everyone's eyes were on me. Emmet's booming laughter echoed around the room. \"god Edward she's already blushing!\" This made me blush all the more but before anyone could laugh again Alice was pulling me towards everyone. \"Happy Birthday Bella\" they all chorused, even Rosalie gave a slight smile. We started with Carlisle and Esme's present. \"We hope you like it\" Esme said kindly. I was opened them I was shocked too see two plane tickets to Florida. \"So you can see your mother\" Esme explained \"Wow you guys, thanks so much!\" \"No problem bella\" Carlisle smiled. Rosalie was next. I wasn't of what I should expect from Rosalie. \" It's a necklace\" she said bluntly. \" Alice picked it out\" \"wow thanks Rosalie\" I said as kindly as I could. She gave a quick smile and stepped back. Lastly it was Emmet and Jasper. Emmet chucked me a box. I shook it and gave them a confused look. They both laughed out loud and Jasper answered \" don't worry bella we already installed it in your truck. \"oh, ok\" I laughed. \"ooooh Bella have you seen your cake?\" Alice said excitedly. \"wait what cake?\" I asked confused.

Was it a bad idea to leave Renesmee with Alice, I thought. As I got the keys out, I heard footsteps from behind. The keys jingled as I started to shake. I quickly turned around, afraid of what was behind. Of course, it was Alice herself. I exclaimed,\"What the hell are you doing? Shouldn't you be watching Renesmee?\" Alice pointed to her Volvo. \"Don't worry, she's in the car,\" she assured. I continued,\"Well, what are you doing outside of the house? Shouldn't you be inside safely? Where did you go?\" Alice answered,\"To the mall! Look what she's wearing.\" Renesmee was wearing those fancy jean diapers and a T-shirt that said 'Vampires Rock.' I grinned as my anger quickly went away. She was only trying to help. She's an awesome Aunt-In-Law. \"Okay. I admit, she's rockin' the vampire outfit. Just please make sure she's with you at all times.\" Alice exclaimed,\"Of course! She's my niece. She's the daughter I'll never have.\" I wondered,\"...What about Jasper?\" Her grin faded. \"W-well, Jasper doesn't want kids. H-he made it very clear that all his love was for m-me, not for kids. I was a little angry at Jasper. Just because he's the man doesn't make him the boss. He shouldn't control Alice's life. \"But why the hell not? Can't he at least compromise? Just one damn child!\" Alice slowly said,\"Calm done, Bells. I'm totally okay with it for now. We'll have that talk in ten years. Her smile came running back. I don't want to see her down. She's like my best friend. She asked,\"Do you have any plans? it's almost Thanksgivin'. That comes befor Christmas!\" I said,\"We want to go to Florida, but Edward's torn on that or Las Vegas.\" I laughed. I imagine him trying the slot machines, yelling every time he lost. Alice squealed,\"I wanna go to Florida! I heard one of your relatives live there?\" I smiled. \"Yup. I don't know her though. She's my long lost sister.\" Alice grinned. \"Amazing. So... Am I allowed to... Come?\" She put her arms behind her back and start rocking left and right in a pleading motion. I smiled again, unwillingly. \"Uh, sure. Wh-why not? You're her long lost sister-in-law.\" Why do I have to be so nice? \"Yay,\" she said as she opened the door to the house and went in. I remembered what Edward had told me earlier. Come to the Burger King at 5 PM. It was 4:50. I rushed to the same Volvo Alice was driving and used my brand-new second key to the car. It was easy to know what Burger King to go to, because there aren't many in Forks. When I got there, the only car there was - You guessed it - a Volvo. Edward was right at the entrance, and he kissed me to the closest booth. He held me in his arms, kissing my neck like he was about to bite it. I felt lucky to not have to worry about that. He could never bite another vampire. I love him more than myself. I've heard myself say it a million times, but I can't help myelf. He's my life, and without him, I don't need to live. He's my first and last love. When he finally took the time to breathe, he started talking about our first real vacation. \"So. No nomads, no volturi. Just us.\" I nodded. I didn't know how to tell him that it wasn't just us. \"E-edward, I need to tell you something.\" He looked serious. \"What?\" I blurted it out,\"This... isn't the dream vacation you want. I'm only going there to see my long lost sister. And even if we wanted to squeeze some romance in, Alice wants in, and I can't say no...\" He was frozen. I wouldn't know what to say if I told myself that. He breathed deeply. \"Uhh... Well, I don't know what to say... First off, I have money. It's only gonna take one day to meet your sister. And the Alice problem can be solved. Just bring Jasper along. If we get a room for us and a room for them, we'll both be able to have our romance. Is that okay?\" I was left speechless. I think I look for problems myself. I mean, why couldn't I think of that? We could buy a second house there if we wanted. Maybe we should. I asked,\"Do you have enough money to buy our second house there?\" Edward nodded. \"I have money for whatever you want, honey.\" He kissed me again. \"Let's go now,\" He said. \"Now?\" He assured,\"Yes, now.\" It took a couple of hours to get there, but we made it. As we drove to look for a house, we saw a sign that said,\"Welcome To Florida.\" We arrived at the city of Orlando not long after. Edward asked,\"Where does your sister live?\" I read a piece of paper. \"2569 Sunfish Street in Winter Run II.\" We quickly got to the neighborhood, and it wasn't that big. The houses were really small... and really ugly. Her house was the ugliest; it was a booger green color. \"Ugh,\" I retched. Edward sighed,\"This is gonna be a long day.\" ","Summary":" CHAPTER 1: FLORIDIAN VACATION I (bella) got to Edward's home, feeling uneasy.

I remembered that crazy dream I had. I dreamt that I was a Vampire. This dream was after my family had died. So, let's start from there. It was September 3rd, 1997. The day of the car crash. All I could hear was the Police Sirens. I opened my Eyes and I could see that I was in an Amublace. I had seen Amublace's race to the Hospital. Never thinking that I would be in one. I could feel that my Head, Leg, and Arm were banaged. Then, a Man with short dark brown Hair came into view. \"Were almost there Eleanor. Just hold on.\"He said. I wished that I could say\"Yeah. Sure. Ok. No big deal.\" But I was to weak. The Ambulace pulled up at the Hospital. The Doctor's pulled me and the bed out of the Ambulace. They pushed the bed to a room and put me on the other bed. The Doctor gave me a shot and one minute later, I began to get very sleepy. \"It's okay, Eleanor. You're going to be ok.\"He said. \"Just sleep.\" I did as he said. And I fell asleep into the Cold, Dark Night. I woke up the next morning, and I couldn't remember what happened last night. A Nurse came in and saw that I was awake.\"Oh. You're awake.\"She said.\"Who are you? Where's my Mom and Dad?\"I asked, freaking out.\"Calm down, Eleanor. I'm Mary O'Shea. I'll be taking care of you.\"She answered. She walked up and sat down on the side of my bed.\"Where's my Mom and Dad?\"I asked again.\"Don't you remember what happened last Night?\"She asked.\"No.\"I answered.\"You were in a Car Crash. And, your parent's didn't make it. I'm so sorry.\"She answered.\"But you can still stay with your Grandparent's\" \"I don't have any.\"I said.\"Oh, well. How about your cousins or aunt's or uncle's?\"She asked.\"No.\"I answered.\"I'm an Orphan.\"I said. Mary sighed. \"I know what's it's like.\"She said.\"I was an Orphan too. \"Then, a doctor came in the room. Mary stood up and took her leave. \"Good Morning, Eleanor. How do you feel?\"He asked. \"Fine.\"I answered. \"I'm so very sorry about your parent's.\"he said. \"I don't want to talk about it.\"I said. \"Ok. Well, get some sleep.\"He said. \"Wait. How long am I going to be in here?\"I asked. \"At least three weeks.\"He answered. Then, he turned the light's off and closed the door. I closed my eyes and fell asleep. Not knowing what would happen. THREE WEEKS LATER Chapter 2. Strange Symptoms. Mary drove me to St. Andrews Orphage. I had to admit, I will miss her. Mary pulled up next to the sidewalk. \"Thank you, Mary.\"I said. \"For what, dear?\"She asked. \"For everything.\"I answered. She smiled. I got out of the car and entered the Orphanage. A woman with long Blonde hair came up to me. \"Hello. You must be Eleanor.\"She said. I nodded. \"You can call me Nel.\"I said. \"Alright. I'm Ms. McConnor. Come on. I'll show you to your room.\"I followed Ms. McConner down the hall and into room 309. She opened the door and I saw other Orphan's playing games. \"Children!\"Ms. McConner said. The Children stopped playing, turned and looked at Ms. McConner. \"This is Eleanor Linsee. Your new roommate.\"She said. Ms. McConner looked down at me. \"Your bed is over in the corner. Just call if you need anything.\"She said. Then, she left the room. The Children went back to their games. I walked over to my bed and started unpacking. \"Hello.\"Said a young, dark haired boy. \"Hi.\"I said. \"My name is Gregory.\"He said. \"I'm Eleanor. But you can call me Nel.\"I said. \"Nice to meet you.\"He said. \"You too.\"I said. \"So, what's your favorite color?\"He asked, starting a conversation. \"Purple.\"I answered. \"What's your favorite food?\"He asked. \"Spaghetti.\"I answered. \"Your lucky because that's what we're having tonight.\"He said. I smiled and nodded. I finished putting my last pair of clothes in the drawer. \"Well, that's everything.\"I said. \"Cool.\"Gregory said. I sat on my bed and pulled out a book. I started on the chapter I think I had left off. \"What were your parent's names?\"Gregory asked. \"My Mother's name was Imelda and my Father's name was William.\"I answered. \"What happened to them?\"He asked. \"They died in a car crash.\"I answered. \"Where were you going?\"He asked. \"I don't remember.\"I answered. \"Where did you live?\"He asked. \"I don't remember that either.\"I said. \"You don't remember anything?\"He asked. I nodded. He sighed and left. \"Dinner's ready!\"Ms. McConner called from down stairs. All the children in the room left. I put my book down and walked down stairs. I sat next to Gregory at the table. Ms. McConner passed out bowls of Spaghetti. When Ms. McConner reached me and handed me my bowl, I don't know waht came over me. It was like Spaghetti wasn't my favorite food any more. But my worst. I stared at the bowl, feeling no longer hungry. But my stomach was growling. \"Aren't you going to eat?\"Gregory asked worried. \"No.\"I answered. \"But it's your favorite food.\"He said. \"Not any more.\"I said as I got up and ran back up stairs. I sat on my bed, not knowing what had happened back down stairs. I looked out the window. It was sunset. I looked at the beautiful sunset, and for some reason, my eyes started burning. I looked away from the sunset, and my eyes were already better. I looked back and they burned again. I looked away and they were all better as if it had never happened. I sighed not knowing what was happening to me. Ms. McConner walked in the room worried. \"Are you alright?\"She asked. \"I don't know. I think somthing's wrong.\"I said. \"Do you want me to take you to the hospital?\"She asked. I nodded. I got up and followed her down stairs. She grabed her keys and tuned towards the children. \"Now children. I'm going to take Eleanor to the hospital. You stay here.\"She said. I walked outside and waited for Ms. McConner in her car. Ms. McConner got in two minutes later, turned the key and drove me to the hospital. The sunset was in front of us when we drove to the hospital. I had to close my eyes. We arrived at the hospital five minutes later. I walked with Ms. McConner to the front desk. Even the light's in the buliding burned my eyes. \"Hi. How may I help you?\"Said the nurse. \"Eleanor here says that there's something wrong with her.\"Ms. McConner said. \"Ok. And what's wrong with you?\"She asked me. \"I couldn't eat and the light's are burning my eyes.\"I answered. She nodded and called a doctor. \"Ok. Right this way.\"The Doctor said. I sighed and followed him to a room. \"Ok. So lay down on the bed and I'll take a few blood test's.\"He said. I layed down on the bed and the Doctor stuck a needle in my arm. I sighed. \"Ok.\"He said as he took the needle back out of my arm. \"So, when did these symptoms start happening?\"He asked. \"Just before dinner.\"I answered. He nodded in thought. \"And the light's hurt your eyes?\"He asked. \"Yes. And it's getting worse.\"I said as the burning in my eyes grew. \"And you said that you couldn't eat you dinner. What do you mean exactly?He asked. \"It didn't seem like I could eat it. Like I would throw-up if I did eat it.\"I explained. He nodded. \"Ok. I'll let you sleep till the morning. And we'll see how you'll do then.\"He said. He then turned the light's off and walked out of the room. I sighed and looke out the window. The sun was already gone and the stars were just starting to come out. I layed back down and went to sleep. Chapter 3. Vampire. I woke up the next morning, with the sun shining in my eyes. It didn't just burn my eyes, but now my whole body. I threw the blanet's over my head and body. It did a little help. I heard the door open and a Doctor walk in. \"Eleanor.\"The Doctor called. \"What?\"I asked. \"What are you doing under the blanket?\"He asked. \"The Sun. It's burning me everywhere.\"I answered. I heard the Doctor walk towards the window and close the blinds. I took the blanet off feeling much better. \"Are you ok?\"He asked. \"No. I can't stand this.\"I answered. \"Well, I looked at your Blood Sample and everything seems to be ok.\"He said. \"Then why is the sun and the light's burning my eyes? And why couldn't I eat yesterday?\"I asked. \"I don't know.\"He answered. I sighed. \"I'll go get Ms. McConner.\"He said as he left the room. I didn't know what do to. I wanted to be free of this strange sickness. I felt like I wanted to hit something. Then I heard something move. I looked over to my left and saw that a pianting had just moved. I stared at it in thought and then it went back to normal. My eyes widened in fright. For a second, I thought I had Telekenisis, then I thought that was crazy. But then, it moved again. I raised my hand and it moved again. I surly had Telekinesis. I looked straight ahead and moved a cup. I smiled, enjoying this. I raised my hand higher this time and the cup flew up. I noticed my hand was very pale. I lifted my hand down and the cup fell to it's death. I looked at my other hand and it was very pale too. I got up and looked at myself in the Mirror. I was extremly pale. I also had dark shadows under my eyes like someone who didn't get a good sleep. I closed my eyes, thinking that this was a dream. And suddenly, a word poped into my mind. I opened my eyes and said it out loud. \"Vampire.\" I panicked. I had all the symptoms. I couldn't eat normal food, I didn't like the light, and I was extremly pale. I can't be a Vampire , I thought. That would mean I'm dead and that I don't exist . I panicked even more. I didn't exist. \"I have to get out of here.\"I said out loud. I took a deep breath and walked outside. The Light's were horrible, but I continued to walk. \"Hey, you need to get back in your room!\"A Nurse called. \"No I don't.\"I said. \"Hey, you stop right there!\"The surity gaurd said. I stopped and turned around slowly. \"Ok. Now go back to your room.\"The Gaurd said. I could suddenly feel my fangs. I smiled, showing him my fangs. I could feel my eyes turning red, and the burning lights. I raised my right hand and threw a table at him. I turned around and ran outside and away from the Hospital. I remembered that Vampire's could fly. Thinking about this, my body flew up. But then I went down. For a net was thrown over me. Luckily, I was in the shade. I fell to the ground, and heard the cops loading there guns. \"We've got a physico trying to run away. Over.\" I heard one of the Cops say into his radio. \"Stop right there! You are surrounded. Put your hands behind your head immeditly.\"Another one said. I smiled. I raised my both of my hands and made their cars drive away from them. Then I took away there Guns and pointed them at the Cops. The Cops raised there hands up. I smiled again and flew away. Dropping the guns as I did so. I flew down to a dark spot I had always seen, and stayed there till Night time. Chapter 4. Leaving. I watched the Sun go down behind the mountians. I sighed and flew up to the sky. I decided to go back to the Orphage. I flew to my window, and saw no one inside. I looked at my bed and saw a cross hanging on the wall. I looked away. I continued to float in the air, when I saw the door open. I sat on the window ledge. \"Eleanor?\"A voice asked. I looked over and saw that it was Gregory. \"Hi.\"I said. \"What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the Hospital.\"He said, walking towards me. \"The hospital can't help me. I have to go away.\"I said. \"You're leaving?\"He asked. I nodded. \"Well, what's wrong with you?\"He asked. \"I'm a Vampire.\"I answered. \"A Vampire? But that's impossible.\"He said. \"I'm sorry. But I must leave.\"I said. \"Just because your a Vampire dosen't mean you have to leave.\"He said. \"If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna go nuts.\"I said. \"I remember one thing that I had read on the internet about Vampires. It said that if there is ever a Vampire with no family, then that Vampire must go out and find a Vampire family.\"I explained. Gregory sighed. \"Will I ever see you again?\"He asked. \"I don't know.\"I answered. \" I must leave. Goodbye, my friend.\"I said and flew away. I flew over the town and the hospital. I saw Ms. McConner down there and thought I can't leave without a Goodbye. I flew down to the roof top and saw all cops looking up at me. \"Eleanor!\"Ms. McConner said. I gently flew down to her and all the cops held up there weapons. \"I must leave. Goodbye.\"I said. \"Where are you going?\"She asked. \"I'm off to find my Family.\"I answered. \"Good luck.\"She said. I smiled and flew away. I flew over the Forest and over the freeway, wondering where my family could be. I flew over a River and over many other buildings. I remembered that Vampire's could also turn into Bats. I quickly phased into a Bat and began my long journey. Chapter 5. Answers. I landed in the forest phasing back to normal form. I looked around and saw a deer. I was rather thirsty. I snuck up on it and drank it clean. When I was done I walked deeper into the Forest and saw that the Sun was rising. I hid behind a tree and slept there for the day. I woke later that night hearing cars. I got up and looked around. I saw a building up ahead. I walked towards it and saw that it was a Musem. I walked inside and a scuplture of a Vampire. I read about it and learned that Vampires belong in Scotland. I nodded. And began to walk away, bumping into one of the visitors. \"Sorry.\"The Man said. I couldn't stop looking at him. I could smell his scent. And it smelled good. Even thought my eyes weren't red anymore, I still craved for him. \"Are you ok?\"He asked. I pulled it together and tried to control it. \"Fine.\"I answered. He nodded, turned around and walked away. I walked out of the musem smelling more scents. I walked down the street, watching the cars race by. Reminding me when I was in the Hospital. I passed by a building with a man with a long white beard. The man was trying to grab a cup for a costumer, but couldn't reach it. I raised my hand and lowered the cup to the mans hand. His eyes widened and looked at me. \"Thank you miss.\"He said. I nodded and walked away. I knew that the Costumer was a Scientist, because I could fell his eyes on my back. I knew he was following me with the cup in his hand. When I was out of sight from everyone else, I turned around and faced him. \"Can I help you?\"I asked. \"I would like to know how you did that.\"He answered. \"Telekinesis. Have a good night.\"I said, turned around and flew to the sky. I flew over the buildings and landed in the entrance of the town. I read the sign and found out that I was in Dickens, London. And I had to be in Scotland. I flew over to a forest once again, hid behind another tree, and went to sleep. I woke up that night, hearing a strange sound. I looked around and saw that it was only a bird. I got up and walked out of the Forest. I found a store across the road. I walked across the street and entered the store. I found a black shirt, and some black shorts. I went into the womens dressing room and tried them on. The fit good. I hid my other clothes and walked out of the store with my new clothes. I remembered that I was in London. I looked around to make sure no one was looking. No one was. I raised my arm and flew to the sky. I must of been flying for hours because when I looked down, I saw a sign that read: Welcome to Culross Fife, Scotland. I smiled, knowing that I had arrived. I flew down to the ground and found another deer. I ate it, cleaned mself up and walked towards the town. When I walked in, everyone sarted at me. I stopped walking and looked at everyone. \"It is her. She has arrived.\"An old man said. \"It can't be her. She has died 9 Centurys ago.\"Another woman said. \"It is her reincarrnation.\"He said. \"What are you talking about, sir?\"I asked. \"You don't know?\"He asked. \"Don't know what?\"I asked. He looked down at the ground in deep thought. \"9 Centurys ago,\"A younger man said. \"A woman named Elizabth Linsee, lived here. She didn't know it but she was a Vampire. She had a dream once, that her Necklace, that she always wore, started to glow. And when it stopped, she was Human. She didn't know how she became a mortal once again, but she sure loved it.\" I looked at him like he was crazy. \"What is your last name child?\"The Old man asked. \"Linsee.\"I answered. \"Then it is true. You are the reincarrnation of Elizabeth linsee.\"He said. \"That's immposible. You're all lying.\"I said as I flew away. I flew away to an old House didn't have anyone in it. I sat on the window ledge like how I did back at the Orphage. I missed Gregory and Ms. McConner. I thought about what those had said to me, and wondered if it was really true. \"Can I help you?\"A voice asked. I looked into the room and an extremly pale man stand on one side of the bed. He had black hair and looked like he had a Vampire costume on. \"Who are you?\"I asked. \"My name is Frederik . What's yours\"He asked. \"Eleanor Linsee.\"I answered. \"Linsee? Like Elizabeth Linsee?\"He asked. \"I don't know.\"I answered. \"Come on down.\"He said. I didn't move. \"Don't worry. I won't bite.\"He said. \"You wouldn't want to any way.\"I said. \"Why's that?\"He asked. \"I'm a Vampire.\"I answered. Chapter 6. Meet the Family. \"Your a Vampire?\"He asked. I nodded. \"So, am I.\"He said. I looked outside at the town. \"Come on down and meet my Family.\"He said. I looked at him for a second then hopped down. I followed Frederik into the other room where I saw two Vampire boys and his wife. The Boys stopped playing there game and stood up. \"Victoria. This is Eleanor. Eleanor. This is my wife, Victoria. And these are my two sons. David and Simon.\"He said. \"Hello Eleanor.\"Victoria said. \"Hi.\"I said back. \"This is the reincarrnation of Elizabeth Linsee.\"He said. \"Really? After all these years?\"David asked. \"Well, I don't really know if I really am her Reincarrnation.\"I said. Then, Simon walked up to me and he felt my hand. Frederik joined David and Victoria as Simon looked at me. He pulled on my shirt. I kneeled down and he played with my face. He moved my mouth till he made me smile. He smiled as well. \"Oh there you are Elizabeth.\"He said. Frederik kneeled down by Simon and looked at me. He smiled. I stopped smiling and stood up. Frederik stood up and walked back to Victoria. \"You see, Eleanor.\"He began. \"Elizabeth was our Daughter. And when she became Human, she forgot all about us. \"So, what was so special about her?\"I asked. \"Legend says that she had unfinished bussiness. Her bussiness was to turn us into Humans. But she never did. So, they say that she will one day be reincarrnated, come back, find us and finish the job. And that is you. You are the reincarrnation of Elizabeth Linsee.\" \"How do you know?\"I asked. \"Your smile. She had the exact same smile.\"He answered. \"And your hair. Her's was brown and she loved to have it short.\"Victotia said. \"She also had Telekinesis when she was a Vampire.\"David said. When he said that, I got mad. It was true. I was the reincarrnation of Elizabeth Linsee. But I didn't want to be. I made some of the glasses on the break and fall. I turned around and left the room. I walked into another room and stopped. It looked very familar. There was a bed, fireplace, and a window. Frederik walked in then and put a hand on my shoulder. \"This was her room.\"He said. I walked over to the window and looked out. I saw the town and a river. \"Did Elizabeth used to look out this window?\"I asked. \"Yes. All the time.\"He answered. \"How did your daughter die?\"I asked. \"Elizabeth died from a car crash.\"He answered. \"How could she forget about you? You were her father.\"I asked. \"I know. We tried everything to make her remember, but she just couldn't.\"He answered. \"So, how does everyone in the town know?\"I asked. \"She was famous for her talented gift.\"He answered. \"We made a promise that if we were ever to see our Daughter's reincarrnation, we would do what ever it takes to make her remember.\"He said. I dares not to ask any more questions, because it looked like he was going to cry if he could. I looked back out the window, and thought about Elizabeth. I saw the sunlight peaking over the mountains and hit my eyes. I backed away immedeitly. \"Come on.\"Frederik said. He lead me to the other room with everyone else. He opened a coffin for me. \"Hop in.\"He said. I sighed and hopped in the Coffin. Frederik closed the door and it was pitch black. I closed my eyes and went to sleep. Chapter 7. The Necklace. I was 99.5 percent sure this was a dream. The reason was because I was on a cliff. And I was wearing a necklace. My Necklace started to glow and I was gone. I was suddenly in a bed. I got up and put my necklace away in a drawer. I went down stairs and saw Frederik with his wife and two sons. They then disappeared as I did. And I heard a car crashing. I looked over and saw Elizabeth lying down on the street. I ran over to her when she disappeared and I was suddenly in my moms car. I looked over and looked at my Mom. Mom looked at me and smiled. I looked ahead and saw a truck heading straight for us. Mom turned to the right and fliped over. And I heard a faint cry. I looked over and saw that it was me, in the car on the side of the road. I had left my body. I was dead. My eyes flashed open. I remembered that I was in a coffin. I opened the lid and saw that the sun was going down behind the Mountians. I got up and looked for the drawer I had put the necklace in. I went in Elizabeth's room and found her Drawer. I opened the top drawer and found the Necklace. The Necklace had a green Emerald on it and gold chain. I turned around and remembered everything. I remembered Frederik sitting on my bed reading a story. And how simon used to make Mud pies in the house. I looked down at my clothes, and sighed. I set the Necklace down and walked over to my bed. I saw something sticking out from under Elizabeth's bed. I bent down and grabed it. I looked at it and saw that it was an old picture of Elizabeth, Frederik, Victoria, David, and Simon. I remembered when this picture was taken. We were just celebrating my 13th birthday. Frederik walked in the room then, and saw what picture I was looking at. I looked up at him. He had a sad look on his face. \"I'm sorry Dad.\"I said. \"For what?\"He asked. \"For forgetting about you.\"I answered. I walked over to him and was struggling to hold it together. \"It's ok Dad.\"I said. \"You finally remember?\"He asked. \"I remember everything.\"I answered. He opened his arms and he grabed me for a hug. I walked into the other room with the rest of my family. They looked at me with sad eyes. \"Back at the Orphage,\"I began. \"I started having these strange symptoms. So, Ms. McConner took me to the Hospital. The next day, I was a Vampire. I remembered what I had read on the internet, I had to find another Family. So, I took off and found my way here.\" \"So, you knew that there was a Family waiting for you?\"Victoria asked. I nodded. \"Ok. So, what about your dream?\"David asked. \"I found my Necklace. I can take you to the Cliffs and we can become Humans.\"I said. They nodded in agreement. Frederik took David and Victoria followed them. I ran to my bed a grabed the Necklace. I ran back and saw that Simon stayed behind. \"Come'on, Mud pie.\"I said. Mud pie was a name I used to call him. He smiled. I grabed his hand and flew outside. I caught up with Frederik and sighed. I had found my real Family. I felt peaceful now. Frederik phased into a bat. I did the same and so did everyone else. We flew over the town and over the Forest towards the cliff. We landed on the ground we phased back to normal forms. I pulled my necklace out and walked to the edge of the Cliff. I closed my eyes and nothing happened. \"How am I supossed to do this again?\"I asked. \"Close your eyes and Dream that we're all Humans.\"Mom answered. \"Thanks Mom.\"I said. She smiled. I closed my eyes and imagined that we were all humans. My necklace started to glow. I opened my eyes and looked at my Necklace. It glowed a bright white color. I felt peaceful again. Like all my worries were over. But then, I felt this horrible pain in back that had moved to my dead, nonbeating heart. I leaned forward and fell off Cliff. \"Elizabeth!\"I heard Dad call. I fell down towards the Ocean. When I landed in it, I knew it was all over. I had failed my quest once again. My Family was going to have to wait another 9 centuryt's till I came back. It was all over. Chapter 8. Gone. I woke later that night in a bed. I remembered when I fell off the cliff. I thought I had died. I opened my eyes and tried to get up. But I felt a terrible pain in my chest. I layed back down and heard a door open. I looked to my right and saw dad walk in the door. \"Dad. What happened?\"I asked. \"You were shot.\"He answered. \"How? I thought vampire's could only die from a wooden stake.\"I said. \"Yes. You were shot with a wooden stake.\"He explained. Frederik sat down on the edge of the bed. \"Who shot me?\"I asked. \"A man that doesn't like Vampire's. But don't worry. We got rid of him.\"He answered. \"Where's the Necklace?\"I asked. \"It fell down with you. It's gone.\"He answered. \"What do we do now?\"I asked. \"Well. Mom was looking up Vampire's and she found out that there is another Necklace.\"He explained. \"Where is it?\"I asked. \"Dickens, London.\"He answered. \"That's where I lived.\"I said. \"How am I going to get there? I'm to weak to fly or to walk.\"I asked. \"I don't know.\"He answered. \"How did I live?\"I asked. \"I don't know that either. I guess I pulled the stake out in time and put the medicene on in time.\"He answered. Just then I could feel the bangedes wraped around my chest. \"How long will it take to get to Dickens?\"I asked. \"About three days.\"He answered. I sighed. I then remembered something I had seen when I was a little girl. I was in a hotel room. The room number was 314. I remembered walking outside to go to the pool when I saw room 313. The door was open. I remember walking inside and feeling a strange presence there. That's when mom found me and carried me to the pool. \"Are you ok?\"Dad asked. \"Room 313. Don't go into room 313.\"I said as if I were being controlled by the devil. \"What?\"Dad asked. I didn't move. Victoria walked in te room then. \"How are you doing?\"She asked. Still, I didn't move. \"Can I talk to you outside for minute?\"Dad asked, taking Mom outside. \"Do you know what Elizabeth said just before you walked in?\"I heard Dad ask. \"No.\"Mom answered. \"She said to not to go into room 313.\"Dad said. \"Do you know what she meant?\"Mom asked. \"No.\"Dad said. I snapped out of it then and looked around the room. \"Dad.\"I called. Dad entered the room, walked towards me and sat down. \"Yes?\"He asked. \"What happened?\"I asked. \"You told me not to go into room 313.\"Dad answered. \"Why?\"He asked. \"Because, I felt a presence the last time I was there.\"I answered. \"Was it Elizabeth?\"He asked. \"I don't know.\"I answered. \"Ok. We have to get going. Mom says that the Necklace was in a hotel called Hilton.\"He said. \"That was the name of the hotel that the room was in.\"I said. \"Are you sure?\"He asked. I nodded. \"Ok. We'll look for it when we get there. Now let's go.\"He said. I tried to get up but failed. It hurt to much. \"I can't do it.\"I said. Frederik put his arms under me and lifted me up. \"I'll carry you.\"He said. \"You can't carry me forever.\"I said. \"I know. We'll take a few stops.\" He said. He carried me out of the my room and into Simons room where everyone else was. \"I'll have to carry her to Dickens.\"Dad said. \"Ok.\"Mom said. \"Is she going to be ok?\"David asked. \"Yeah. She's going to be fine.\"Dad answered. \"She's just a little tired.\" He was right. Frederik flew out the window and everyelse followed him. We flew over many more trees and over the town once again. Victoia, David and Simon phased into bats. Frederik stayed in normal form because of me. I grabed around Dad around the neck like how I used to, and fell asleep in his arms. Chapter 9. Room 313. I woke the next night againest a building. I opened my eyes and saw Simon. \"Hi.\"He said. \"Hi. Where's Mom and Dad?\"I asked. \"They went for a quick hunt.\"He answered. David came into my view then. He nodded his head as if to say hello. \"So, do you know in the room the necklace was, Elizabeth?\"David asked. \"Look. I know I'm your reincarrnated sister, but my name now is Eleanor. No I don't.\"I answered. He nodded. I got up, still pained from my chest. I was now strong enough to stand up once again. I saw Frederik and Victoria walk from the Forest. \"Your standing.\"Mom said. I nodded. \"Are you strong enough to fly?\"Dad asked. \"I think so.\"I answered. \"Let's go.\"He said. I raised my arm and slowly flew up. I flew up above the building but then started to fall. David grabed my hand and helped me fly. Frederik took the lead and Mom stayed behind me. Simon flew on my right side. \"How much longer till we get there?\"I asked. \"We're already here. We're just trying to find the hotel.\"David answered. I looked ahead and I reconized everything that I had seen when I was little girl. I reconzied the street and the buildings. I saw that we were following Sunset street. I remembered that the Hotel was on Apple street. \"It's that way.\"I said pointing left. We flew left and saw the hotel. \"There it is.\"Simon said. Frederik landed on the drive way as well did we. I let go of David's hand and followed dad into the Hotel. We went up the Elevator to level 2. When we got there, we made a left then a right. Eventually, we found room 313. I opened the door and lead everyone in. I walked in and felt the same presence I had when I was little. I walked towards it and the presence lead me to a drawer. I opened the top drawer and found the Necklace. The Necklace looked excatly the same as the last did. I pulled it out of the drawer and put it around my Neck. \"Ok. We have to go.\"Mom said. I turned around and followed them back outside. When I was outside again, I saw St. Andrews Orphage and thought about Gregory. \"Come on Liz\"Mom said. I looked at her and continued walking. We walked down the street and towards the forest. Mom phased into a bat and flew to the sky. Everyone else did the same. I phased last and slowly followed them away from Dickens. We flew over the town and towards the Cliff once again. I phased back to normal form and walked to the edge of the Cliff, being extra careful. Mom, Dad, David and Simon phased back to normal form as well, and stood behind me. I took off my Necklace and held it up. I closed my eyes and imagined me and my Family as Humans again. My Necklace started to glow. I opened my eyes and saw a big roll of thick fog a rise from the Cliff. The Fog surrounded me and my Family. The fog was so thick, when I turned and looked at them, I couldn't see them. I looked back and saw that the Light was getting brighter and brighter. Then, it suddenly went away. The Fog, and the light. I knew that the Ceremony had worked. We were finally free. I woke up feeling rather strange. I got up and realized that I was back at the Orphanage. I realized then that it was all just a dream. I sighed. It never happened. \"Eleanor! Can you come down for a minute?\"I heard Ms. McConner call. \"Ok!\"I called back. I got dressed and walked down stairs, meeting Ms. McConner at the end.\"Come on now. There's a family down waiting to meet you.\"She said. I followed her to the front desk and couldn't believe my eyes. Frederik, Victoria , David and Simon stood at the other end of the desk as they looked like at the end of my strange dream. \"This is Eleanor.\"Ms. McConner said. \"Hello Eleanor.\"Frederik said. \"I'm Frederik.\"He said. \"I know.\"I said. \"How? Have we meant?\"He asked. \"Yes. But first, do you know anyone named Elizabeth?\"I asked. \"Yes. Elizabeth was out Daughter. But, she went missing. Why?\"He asked. \"Because, I know where she is.\" ","Summary":" Blood Transfusion Chapter 1 Orphan. I remembered that crazy dream I had.

O resto dos personagens é secundário e apareceram muito também, porém como toda história, acaba se colocando só os principais. Capitulo 1: A paz ainda distante. Esta história começa assim: Eu que vos falo, sou William Dimon, e sou líder de um dos lados de uma guerra que , entre as sombras , dura a sé a morte de William o primeiro lobisomem, e de Marcos o primeiro vampiro, todos achávamos que tudo voltaria ao normal, e que ambas as maldições acabariam, mas a afirmação de marcos era uma mentira, ninguém deixou de ser lobisomem, nem deixou de ser vampiro, e depois de passado alguns anos , ambas as partes perceberam que isso não ia mudar, então decidiram dar um basta e decidir de vez qual seria a raça vencedora. Com o intuito de derrubar de vez a corja dos vampiros, reuni todos os lycans, dei a eles tecnologia, ajudei com tramas, com táticas, e deixamos de ser simples animais, como eles uma vez, e derrotaram William e Marcos, estava na hora mesmo de dar um fim a isso, não sei oque o destino me reserva, porém eu farei tudo para alcançar a vitória, e acabar com essa seqüência insana de mortes causada por eles mesmos. William :- Selena, nem pense numa droga dessas! Anda a fumar alguma coisa? Selena :- Uma ova! Já arranjamos a base, está feito, eles não tem culpa se você me deu poderes plenos -cruza os braços-, eu também criei aR.C.V. Will então a única coisa a se fazer e dar a ordem final. William - Selena! , como você é impulsiva! –respira fundo- mas está feito, eu não acharia uma ótima idéia, mas não deve ser algo difícil, a primeira coisa que devíamos fazer era na maldita empresa que distribui sangue às sanguessugas. Selena - Então vamos, eu vou ir no primeiro esquadrão, vamos abrir os portões e vocês entram, está bem? –já quase na porta-. William - tudo bem tudo bem, -vai junto dela e segura-a no braço- olhe, tome cuidado, você é o único motivo de eu estar querendo tudo isso, se,se, você morre..eu não vou suportar. Selena - calma Will, prometi não morrer, até quando acabarmos com os mercadores, e com a Diana –semicerra os olhos e olha-o -. William - isso de novo não, esqueça, ela também terá oque merece vamos vamos. Tocar no assunto da Diana era terrível para mim, ela era uma das nossas, logo no começo de toda essa luta, estávamos em uma batalha e ganhando, os mercadores já estavam de retirada, e quando vencemos ela sumiu, eu a vi indo embora e eu fui atrás a perguntar aonde ia e porque estava fazendo aquilo, nós prometemos que iríamos juntos acabar com isso, eu, ela e a Selena foi a 1 ano: Diana - Will , esqueça, eu não vou te dizer nada, eu sei que vai parecer estranho, mas eu, tanta gente morreu, e eu vou dar um basta nisso do meu jeito, e vai ser sozinha, eu sei que oque acontece com agente é bonito, eu te amo – passa a mão no rosto dele- mas, é por isso e pela Selena e por todos vocês que vou fazer isso. William - eu não quero que vá! Podemos fazer isso juntos, eu não sei que tipo de coisa você pode fazer sozinha sendo que nossa raça já tentou a séculos.-acaricia também o rosto dela fechando os olhos-. Diana - fecha os olhos também- não Will, nem vai saber..e quando você descobrir vai me odiar, mas me esqueça, porque quando eu sair por esta porta, a Diana que você conhece vai ficar aqui, e então apenas me esqueça, ok? –afasta-se pra porta-. William - agarra-a e dá um beijo- sim, que este seja nosso último beijo, se é oque você quer, e mesmo tendo medo do que você quer fazer, eu aceito, e sim, eu te esquecerei, pelo bem da Revolta...Adeus, Diana -corresponde e depois abre a porta- é assim que se fala, Adeus Will, boa sorte, e se eu não conseguir acabar com isso primeiro, você consegue , Adeus..-abre a porta e sai- E foi assim que tudo acabou, e que tudo começou, pois alguns meses depois em uma missão de resgate de alguns lycans escravos dos mercadores, descobri que ela trabalhava para os mercadores, e era o braço direito do maldito Simon, líder da corja do mercadores da morte. Voltando a parte, da missão,a Selena acabou mudando um pouco o plano final de combate , apocalipse, criado originalmente por mim e pela Diana e pela Selena, e teve algumas mudanças depois que soubemos que a Diana estava do lado dos vampiros. Estávamos a pensar entre o armazém de armas , e uma empresa que arrecadava sangue para o abastecimento dos sanguessugas, eu optei por primeiro começar com a empresa, mas a Selena , como toda mulher impulsiva, arquitetou tudo para uma batalha na empresa de armamentos, talvez eu entenda a preocupação dela, os malditos fazem armamento todo em prata, metal mortal para nós lycans. Depois de estarmos todos prontos, Selena chamou a todos e foram direto para os arredores , enquanto o meu esquadrão, o purgatório , como foi denominado, nos preparávamos. Selena : -chegando a um morro com cerca de 10 lycans.- Meus amores, eu sei que não gosto que os chame assim, mas como são meu esquadrão já estão acostumados –sorriso e depois uma expressão séria- olhem, isso aqui é para ser feito silenciosamente, não sujem o nome da revolta, somos os assassinos, agimos na surdina, e saímos do mesmo jeito, só depois da missão concluída é que devemos nos divertir. Os lycans gritaram em coro , baixo claro porque agora começava a missã se aproximou com dois do lycans, e escalam os muros,até chega uma janela, onde conseguem ver a fabricação, e podem até sentir o perigo de estar no local, onde se fabrica a morte deles. Pelas contas da Selena haviam lá 20 a 30 guardas nos portões que deveriam abrir, então começou a fazer sinais com as mãos dividindo os 10 e foram em dupla a cada lado das portas .Então logo que estão todos posicionados,tiram pistolas do bolso, com balas ultra-violeta, que graças a William estavam nas mãos de todos,lutar com os vampiros usando só a força e a selvageria não adiantaria , então agora era tudo organizado. Então Selena foi sozinha a um dos lados dos portões, porque não era vice-líder sem motivos, tem-se inicio a primeira ação para a guerra que mesmo na sombras será lembrada, por ser mesmo..a última.

Dinner is ready!\" My mom called. I sighed. I lived such a boring life here in Oregon. No excitment whatsoever. \"How was school?\" Mom asked. \"School was school.\" I replied to her. She chuckled. \"You kids these days. You act as if school isn't fun. I had a good time when I was in high school.\" Mom said. \"When was that, the stone age?\" I asked sarcastically. \"Now come on, I'm only 34, Do I seem old to you?\" She asked. \"Do you want an honest answer?\" I replied. She shook her head. After dinner, she began to wash dishes. \"Mom, I'm going out for a walk!\" I shouted as I was about to head out side. \"A walk?\" mom asked as she came around the corner.\"Honey it's raining cats and dogs out there.\" \"Come on mom, I'm just going down the street.\" I said. She gave me her what are you up to look before she finally agreed to let me go. I loved to take walks during the rain. It somehow satisfied me. It was odd, but true. I walked for a good ten to twenty minutes,when I noticed a woman standing by some trees. You would never expect this to be odd, but why was she looking at me? And this wasn't like any regular look, this was a glare. I'm a person who stays to herself. I'm just a regular anime, vampire loving girl. I turned to walk away, but I couldn't shake the feeling that this woman was still staring at me, so I turned around, and she was no longer there. Am I seeing things? I know that woman was just there. When I turned to go back to my house, the woman was standing in front of me. I jumped back and looked at her. She was a beautiful woman. Had a great sense in fashion, and what I admired most was her orange-fire like hair. She only looked at me. I looked at her. She looked, pale. Which was odd to me. I have never seen anyone's skin like that, unless they were... dead. \"Who... who... who are you?\" I asked. \"My name is Victoria.\" She said to me. Her voice was so cold. I blinked once. Then blinked again. I wanted to walk away, but she touched my arm. I was wearing a jacket, but when she made contact with my arm it felt like ice. It was cold, and it made me shiver. I, at that time, was petrified. \"What's the matter? Not going to tell me your name?\" she asked. \"I...I...I...I'm Ry...Ryane.\" I managed to say. The look in this womans eyes were terrifying. I could literally feel the energy from them. What was it? And why did it feel, evil? \"Tell me, Ryane, have you ever heard of vampires?\" She asked. I nodded. Why was she asking me this? And if I didn't know any better, she had the characteristics of one. \"Well, my dear, would you like to feel what it's like to become one?\" she asked me. Usually, if I was presented with this oppurtunity, I would have said yes in an instant, but this woman had something about her, that I didn't like. \"Well, would you?\" she asked, her voice cold. \"Are you?\" I asked, my voice trembling. She gave a slight laugh. \"Let's say that I can give you your wish to become one of the things you admire so much. Do you accept. It can give your life, excitment.\" She said so calmy and it was convincing. This was what I wanted all of my life, but didn't think I would ever have the chance. Is this really what I want? I shok my head. Victoria grinned. And it seemed so evil. She went to my ear and whispered,\"This will only hurt a bit. The pain is worth the prize.\" I jumped back and I started to run. This woman was crazy. I didn't really believe in vampires. I knew they didn't exist. They couldn't. She appeared in front of me, smiling. \"Get away from me!\" I screamed and I continued to run from her in another direction. Then, I fell. Victoria was right on top of me. \"This will only hurt a little.\" She said and she bit my neck. I wanted to scream, but it shocked me. She actually bit me. This stranger actually bit me on the neck. I turned to hit her, but she was standing above me. \"Only a matter of time my dear.\" She said and she ran away. After that it was horrible, I felt an excruciating pain all over me. It burned.I touched my neck and I screamed. It was so horrible. No human should have to feel this pain. I was that way for what seemed like forever. Soon it stopped, and I felt weird. I didn't feel like myself. I looked around, wondering if Victoria was still in the area. She was nowhere in sight. She had completely vanished. I have to get home. I was sure mom was waiting on me, and was probably worried, because I'm her only child. And mothers love their babies. So I ran. I don't know what it was,but when I ran, I was fast! I stopped and looked around. I was nearly home. But how did I happen to go this fast. I ran again and before I knew it I was at home. I opened the door. \"Mom!\" I called out. She didn't answer. \"Mom! Mom where are you?\" I shouted. Still no answer from mom. I walked around the house and I didn't see anyone, until I went to my room. \"Ryane, you have got to keep your room clean.\" Mom said. I stared at her. What was this feeling. It was odd, but I wanted to, to, to bite her. \"Ryane, honey, you look pale. What's the matter? Mom asked as she walked towards me. I was speechless, still shocked at this feeling. Mom touched my face\"Ryane! Your freezing.\" she said. Something came over me, and it took full control. I grabbed her hand and began to squeeze it. Mom screamed out in pain. \"Ryane, what's wrong with you?\" She asked in pain. The bones cracked. I pulled her towards me and I bit into her neck. I felt an adrenaline rush! I began to suck the blood from her. She opened her mouth, but no scream. I sucked, and sucked, and she said,\"Ryane.\" in a soft voice. That got me out of the trance. I immediately stopped and looked at her body. Her eyes were open, and I could tell she wasn't breathing. \"Mom!\" I said. I shook her lifeless body. I had killed my mother. I couldn't believe it, but it felt, good. \"Well done.\" a voice said. I turned to see Victoria standing in the doorway. \"You.\" I said, angry.\"What did you do to me?\" \"What do you mean. I only gave you what you wanted.\" She replied. \"This is not what I wanted.\" I said to her. \"You said you wanted to become a vampire and I gave it to you. Your wish.\" Victoria said. \"I told you nothing of the sort. I tried to run away from you but you took it upon yourself to pounce on me and bite me!\" I yelled. I closed my eyes and before I knew it I had threw a punch at her, but she grabbed my fist and hurled me into the wall,and I went through it into my mom's room. I stood up and looked at her. She was walking through the hole in the wall. \"Don't even try. It's impossible for you to defeat me.\" she said, but I didnt listen. I tried to hit her again,but she grabbed me by my neck. \"Like I said, it's pointless.\" she said as she slammed me to the floor,which I went through and landed downstairs in the living room. Victoria jumped through the hole. I punched her and she went flying into the kitchen. I was strong, way stronger than I usually was. \"I didn't want this. I never wanted it to be like this.\" I said as I walked towards her to hit her again. \"What's done is done.\" she said as she stood up.\"Now come.\" \"Come?\" I asked. \"I'm not going anywhere with you!\" I lunged forward, and Victoria stepped to the side and she put me in a choke-hold. \"Away from here.\" she said.\"Not stop resisting or I will tear your head off.\" I came to the realization that I couldn't defeat her in this situation, so I gave in. \"But... but... my mom.\" I said. \"What about her? She's dead.\" Victoria said.\"I'm all you have now.\" Those words hurt me as she spoke them. \"From here on out we stick together, you, will serve me.\" she said coldly. I looked at her with a weird expression. \"You want me to serve you? Get real\" I said. She grinned and walked towards the door. \"What choice do you have? You have nothing left. Are you going to walk around and tell everyone that you're a vampire and that you want to suck their blood? That a woman came and bit you and turned you into one of the walking dead. Please. Get over yourself kid. Last chance, if you're coming with me, then come. I have no more time to lose here.\" She said. I hesitated for a minute, then I made up my mind. I followed her. I didn't know what awaited me once I stepped outside, but it was my new life as a vampire. And I had to deal with it. I looked back at the house I had lived in since I was little. I was actually going to leave it behind. \"Good bye mom.\" I said as I closed the door. This was my new life. \"First things first, you need to train. We will start immediately.\" Victoria said.

Pour Audrey, Solange et Gaby... OUBLIEZ TOUT de révélation, d'hésitation et revenez au moment où Edward et bella se séparent. « Tu ne me reverras plus. Je ne reviendrai pas. Poursuis ta vie, je ne m'en mêlerai plus. Ce sera comme si je n'avais jamais existé. » I- Abandon Point De Vue de Bella : Les secondes me font l'effet de minutes, les minutes d'heures et les heures de jours... Ma vie me semble si insignifiante. Voilà bientôt sept mois qui 'il est partit, que ma deuxième famille l'a suivi. Ils me manquaient tous, Alice le petit lutin qui me faisait office de meilleure amie, Esmée ma deuxième mère, même Jasper, Rosalie, Emmett, Carlisle et surtout, surtout, lui. Ed... Prononcer son nom m'est si difficile. Je n'avais jamais vraiment éprouvé pour quelqu'un ce que j'éprouvais pour lui. Maintenant, cette sensation de bonheur a été remplacée par de la peine et de la douleur. Pas un jour ne se passe sans que je ne pense à lui, même si penser a lui ravive ma peine. Tu ne me reverras plus. Je ne reviendrais pas. Poursuis ta vie, je ne m'en mêlerai plus .Ce sera comme si je n'avais jamais existé. Comme si je pouvais faire comme si il n'avait jamais existé. Il était la seule chose qui me donnait vraiment l'envie de vivre, de me lever tout les matins, d'aller au lycée... Ces phrases n'arrêtaient pas de résonner à longueur de journée dans ma tête. Comme si c'était fait exprès pour que je souffre encore plus de ma situation. Combien de fois aurais-je voulu revenir dans le passé pour changer les événements de ce jour? Le jour le plus horrible de ma vie. J'avais souvent repensé à ce qu'il se serait passé si ma fête d'anniversaire s'était bien déroulée. Edward serait-il encore a mes cotés à l'heure qu'il est ou est-ce qu'il m'aurait transformée ? La seule chose dont j'étais sûre, c'est que je serai certainement heureuse et bien dans ma peau a ses cotés. Heureuse car il serait là, bien dans ma peau car depuis Charlie ne me reconnaît plus. Mon physique s'est autant dégradé que mon mental. J'avais énormément maigris, on pouvait presque dire que j'étais anorexique, mes cheveux sont devenus rêches et cassants. J'ai des cernes causées par mes nuit d'insomnies et de cauchemars, je ne souris plus sauf quand je suis avec Jacob... Charlie savait très bien pourquoi et se sentait très impuissant devant cela. Il est comme moi, il n'aime pas dévoiler ses sentiments, mais je vois bien qu'il souffre de me voir ainsi m'apitoyer sur mon sort. Poussant un soupir désespéré j'essuyais la larme qui coulait sur ma joue. Charlie devait être partit depuis un bon bout de temps, sa voiture de police n'était pas garée. Au moins je n'aurai pas à cacher mes larmes, car depuis sept mois je n'était bonne qu'à pleurer. Charlie préférait que je m'en aille plutôt que de me voir dans l'état dans lequel je suis. Je joue à \"la fille qui a mal mais qui va bien\" du mieux que je peux, alors que ça ne passe pas du tout. Je fixai le ciel à travers la fenêtre. Comme presque tous les jours de l'année, il pleuvait, ici, à Forks. Mais aujourd'hui c'était une pluie très légère. Malgré le fait que maintenant ça va faire deux ans que je vis ici, le froid et l'humidité avec moi, ça fait toujours deux. Déjà que mon moral était au plus bas, la pluie n'y arrangeait rien. D'ailleurs, Charlie m'avait demandé mille et une fois si je ne voulais aller à Jacksonville, là où le temps est beau et ensoleillé. Je répondais à chaque fois : non, tu as besoin de moi et je ne t'abandonnerai pas. C'était en partie vrai et aussi une bonne excuse pour ne pas qu'il ne m'envoie pas là-bas de force. En réalité, je n'en avais pas la force. Je déprimais trop pour partir de Forks. Ce n'était en tous cas pas mes amis du lycée qui me retenaient à Forks. Jessica m'ignore royalement et a la réputation de commère du lycée. Mike lui me tourne toujours autour et en espérant que je tourne la page. Angela est devenue très proche de moi et me soutient, mais elle était accaparée par son petit copain Eric. Il faisait un beau couple mais les voir ensemble me faisait mal, donc j'évitais de rester avec elle. Jacob me redonnait de l'espoir et le sourire. Il me faisait du bien mais il ne pouvait pas me faire cesser de penser à ce que j'éprouve encore envers Ed... lui. Jacob était mon meilleur ami, mon rayon de soleil mais il ne fait pas le poids par rapport a l'orage de ma peine. J'avais appris il n'y a pas si longtemps qu'ils étaient devenus loup garous et oui, j'avais oublié de préciser j'attire toujours autant le danger qu'avant. Ca n'avait pas changé et je ne crois pas que sa changera jamais comme ma peine d'ailleurs... Il était près de 7h 30. Je m'habillai en quatrième vitesse, me brossai les dents et me coiffais. Je ne pris pas de petit déjeuner car je ne sentais pas la sensation de faim dans mon ventre et je n'avais pas la tête à manger. Je cherchais mon sac dans ma chambre et finis par le trouver, je le pris et descendis lentement les escaliers. Il était l'heure pour moi de quitter la maison pour aller au lycée. Aller au lycée pour moi, était devenu une vraie torture. Si je m'écoutais je sécherais tout le temps mais ce serai donner à Charlie une raison de m'envoyer à Jacksonville. Fermant la porte de la maison, je me remémorais un souvenir d'Edward venant me chercher avec sa Volvo. Ce que cette époque me manque! Je restais à contempler ce souvenir de lui mais je n'avais pas le temps de rêvasser. Je repris mes esprits, avec beaucoup de mal, tout en regardant ma montre : 7h 50. J'étais en retard. J'allai rejoindre ma vieille Chevrolet, qui, je ne sais pas par quel miracle, tenait encore debout. Je mis les clés dans le contact et démarrai. La route vers le lycée me semblait pas très longue par-rapport à la journée qui m'attend. Ma journée est composée des maths (que je déteste), d'art plastique, d'anglais,( à ce cours, comme a ma grande habitude je n'écoute rien, trop plongée dans mes pensées). Mes notes avaient considérablement chuté. Je m'en fichais! Ensuite, cafétéria. Ce n'est pas une matière mais un cauchemar. Leur table vide me tuait, chaque fois que j'osai poser les yeux dessus. Et, enfin, 2 heures de biologie. Aie ! La biologie ! Je n'avais pas changée de place depuis qu'il était parti et personne n'osait prendre la place de mon voisin. Cette matière que j'avais adorée était devenue celle que j'haïssais le plus car elle me rappelle son souvenir. Son souvenir... En rentrant à la maison, Charlie m'attendais devant la porte. Bella, Je dois aller au bureau ce soir, je ne rentrerait pas tard mais tu devras manger toute seule, c'est Ok! Oui papa. À ce soir. Sur ce, il partit, me laissant seule face à mes souvenirs. Je ne pris pas la peine de manger, je partis me coucher. Comme d'habitude, je ne pouvait pas cesser de penser à lui. Comme chaque nuit mes cauchemars recommençaient. Je me mettais alors à crier dans la maison. D'habitude Charlie était là pour me rassurer mais aujourd'hui il n'est pas là. J'avais chaud, Il fallait que je sorte, que j'aille dans la forêt, à l'endroit où il m'a laissée. Je sorti, démarrai ma voiture. Je m'arrêtais à l'entrée de la forêt. J'étais dans la forêt marchant de plus en plus vite malgré que me fusse essoufflée. Après quelques centaines de mètres parcouru, je trébuchais sur un cailloux et restais allongée là. Du sang coulait de ma tête, je me voyait dans les bras d'Edward et cela me rassura un peu. PDV Aimée : Nous nous promenions dans la forêt, quand tout à coup j'aperçus une jeune filles d'environ 17 ans couchée par terre. Lou attirée par l'odeur humaine courut à vitesse vampirique jusqu'à elle. Nous la suivîmes et quelle ne fut pas notre surprise quand la vîmes. Elle avait le visage baigné de sang et pourtant elle semblait heureuse. Ce fut Lou qui nous ramena à la réalité : - Elle perd beaucoup de sang il faut que l'on fasse quelque chose. - Tu as raison, lui répondis-je, mais si nous la transformons, que va-t-elle dire à ses parents. - Elle n'aura qu'a leur dire qu'elle part étudier ailleurs, me répondit Lou. À ces mots elle se penchât et la mordit. Lou et Julia la portèrent et nous l'emenâme dans notre maison. Sa transformation fut longue, mais lorsqu'elle se fut terminée nous découvrimes devant nous une jeune femme encore plus belle qu'auparavant. Lou était restée à ses côtés le temps de sa transformation et nous appela lorsque celle ci fut terminée. Nous étions autour d'elle, soudain nous vimes qu'elle commençait a reprendre conscience.

Pour Audrey, Solange et"},{"Movie":"Polar Express","Title":"Adventures On the Polar Express","Author":"FantasyWorld1","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11571747","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Every year, I waited for him to come, but he never came. Each Christmas, as a little girl, I would wait for Santa to arrive. I built many traps, yet somehow he always managed to escape them. And each Christmas, I got disappointed when I was given a note saying, \"Better luck next time, from Mr. C\" I loved playing this little game of chase the Clause as a kid. However, when I turned twelve, I started to question his existence. During the twelve days before the big day, I always went to the library, grabbing each and every documentary of the history of Santa Clause I was able to find. But none of them had an answer. Even on the map, I couldn't find the location of the North Pole. And I was old enough to know that the Santa in the mall was fake. Ever since my Mother died, Christmas was a very different feeling. My Father was Jewish, and couldn't keep the Christmas spirit without her, for she celebrated the holiday since she was a Christian. The Christmas Tree would be a reminder that she was always with us no matter what. But it just didn't feel the same. She wasn't right there with us, and always lit up the holiday season. Sure we had Grandma, but.. She always made us feel uncomfortable, and forced us to read a transcript of the Torah. \"Why don't you teach your kids the tradition of our culture?\" Grandma would say, with a thick Yiddish accent. \"It is only fair to the kids that they can believe in whichever religion they prefer\" my Father answered. However, my little sister Veronica (we call her Vika), always loved Christmas, and getting presents from Santa. She was eight years old, and still believed in the legend about the fat jolly man. At age seven, I already had the feeling that it was logically impossible for one man to give Christmas to all the children who celebrated the holiday, all around the world. And like every child, I waited. I woke up at exactly five minutes before midnight, hoping to hear the sound of Santa's sleigh. Yet the only sound I heard was my breathing. Until this one Christmas Eve, I was whisked away on a magical train.[Chapter 2] I woke up earlier than expected, because I really couldn't fall asleep, and because there was also light in the hallway. My thoughts went flying in my head like a breezy tornado. It was half an hour until midnight, and reading was something that was definitely going to relax me. I was determined to stay awake until I heard the sound of sleigh bells. What was a better distraction than reading every single one of my books on the North Pole and the legend of Saint Nick and Santa Clause on Christmas Eve? A lot of things, but it was Christmas. No matter how much I despised the holiday, I wanted to at least get a glimpse of what holiday spirit was like. However, at the strike at 11:35 I heard something that sounded like… sleigh bells? Sleigh bells? Even though I didn't believe in Santa Clause, I still wanted to catch him. Those sounds drove me mad, and they urged me to grab my flashlight and headed to the dining room. I tiptoed down the stairs, and noticed my parents were sleeping, but then why did they leave the light on in the hallway. Sure Vika was scared what there was no light. I heard my Dad snoring all the way from his room, and I thought he woke up when he let out a really big one, causing me to drop my flashlight. It stumbled all way down the stairs, landing flat on the floor. Phew, I whispered to myself. As I did, the noise of the sleigh bells got louder and louder. Yet as they did get louder, I was able to distinguish them from what sounded like… a train? A TRAIN? There weren't even tracks near my house! I ran to the dining room, where the door stood, and I shimmering light was flashing. There was an actual train lying right in front of my house! A man in a conductor's outfit was standing, observing my home. I put on my purple robe, which had my name engraved on it Lily. As soon as I walked out, I felt a gush of snow and wind on my face, and my hair was flying all over me. It was hard to see due to the snow, but the light the conductor was holding helped me keep everything together. \"All aboard!\" The conductor shouted in a loud, booming voice. \"I'm right here\" I told him plainly, and he looked down a few feet to see me. \"Ah, and you must be… Is this your name?\" the man asked, holding up a chart with only my name on it. It read in bold letters: Lily. \"Yes, and I also have it engraved on my robe\" I mentioned. His facial expression turned from a series look to a lighter, more relaxed face. \"I can see that, just wanted to make sure. Now, are you coming?\" he asked. I was confused, where did he want me to go, and why did he want me to go? Was I being shipped off to a late night boring school and my parents didn't notice? \"Is Miss Captain Obvious going aboard on the train?\" the conductor man asked. He was starting to get annoying from that minute, as soon as he called me captain obvious, that was. \"Where are you going to take me? Do my parents know about this?\" The man looked at me in a nervous way and tightened his collar. \"Well, they are notified, and… Where all the Christmas magic is made!\" he exclaimed in a loud booming voice. \"Don't you mean the North Pole?\" I asked, with slight sarcasm in my voice. \"Of course it's the north pole! If Miss Sarcasm decides to go on the train, then I leave you to do so\" he commented, somewhat rudely. Why did he have to be all sarcastic? And I wasn't sarcastic before, so who was he to call Miss Sarcasm? \"I'll pass. I don't want to ruin the Christmas spirit with my sarcasm\" I said, raising my eyebrow and folding my arms. The conductor man looked a little disappointed, and said in a soft voice, \"Alright, then. Off you go to bed, I assume your parents wouldn't want you to get a cold\" He turned his head around, and headed back to his train. I patiently waited for the train to start moving. However, as it did, a thought popped inside my head: what if I do go on the train? I'm sure it wouldn't be so bad… Besides, this train may not even be going to the North Pole! \"Wait!\" I shouted, and started sprinting over the snow. \"Please, stop!\" My yelling was no use at all, because the train went faster and faster. I should've gotten shoe instead[Chapter 3] I caught up to the train in time, but it was still a few feet away. I decided to make a really big jump, like the teachers forced me to in ballet classes I took when I was younger. I pressed my feet against the snow, and felt the heat powering my legs. 3…2…1! I jumped onto the holding bar! But my feet were still on the ground, so I had to pull myself up. Almost tripping over a step, I finally reached what looked like to be passenger carts. There were other children as well, most younger than twelve. I decided to sit alone on the big red seat on my right, and I looked over at the window. Even though it was noisy, it felt so quiet because I sat all alone. That was until… \"Hey, you!\" a boy with neatly combed blonde hair, blue eyes, and glasses shouted at me. It only sounded like he was shouting because he was near me. \"Yeah?\" I said, looking up. \"Are you the new kid being picked up?\" the weird blonde boy asked. \"Most likely\" I answered. That was when his eyes lit up. Did he not know anyone who spoke in a mature way? Or was he just going to say something naughty? \"Well… um, I'm Eddie\" He said, letting out his hand for a shake, which I offered back. \"Lily\" I told him. \"Not so hard to remember\" Out of know where, that kid… I meant Eddie.. Blurted out something I thought was completely out of nowhere. \"I like your hair\" I stared at him blankly, not knowing what to say. \"Thank you?\" The Eddie boy smiled at me awkwardly a few times, before sitting own on his seat. Alarmed by the strange conversation, I moved across from where I sat, and didn't notice that a girl was there until she spoke to me. \"Do you need something?\" said a kind, soft voice. I turned around and noticed a young African girl my age, with braided pigtails and big brown eyes. \"Uh… Sorry, am I bothering you?\" I asked. I really hoped I wasn't bothering her. \"I don't think so…\" the girl quietly said. I grinned in response, hoping to make a normal friend. \"I'm Lily\" I told her, letting out my hand. \"Holly\" Holly replied politely, shaking it. After a few moments of silence, she spoke up out of nowhere, which made me jolt back a little. \"I was actually hoping someone would sit here, its hard sitting alone\" Holly said abruptly. \"I sat here because of an awkward kid, who said he liked my hair\" I told her. Holly laughed at my little joke, and asked, \"Why was it awkward? Wouldn't you like it if someone complimented you?\" she questioned. \"Sure, but not out of nowhere\" I explained to Holly. However, as I did, the train stopped at another house. \"Looks like we're picking up a new kid\" Holly told me, and I anxiously waited. I wondered who the new kid was going to be like. All of the kids soon turned to the house, had a lot of Christmas decorations on it. The conductor stepped out of the train, and the image cleared to what seemed to be a young boy, maybe around my age. \"It's another boy!\" That Eddie kid exclaimed. Holly rolled her eye, and I thought she was rather annoyed of Eddie being a know it all, and that was exactly how I felt. I noticed the boy shaking his head, and the conductor shrugged his shoulders. He turned around, and opened the train door. So the boy wasn't going to go on? I felt the same way too, and now I didn't really regret it as much. I decided to help him. I ran to the window facing the boy and the house, crossing over to another seat. Even though I felt bad for leaving Holly alone, I wanted that kid to get on the train for some reason. \"Hey!\" I yelled, and I saw the boy's face turn towards me. \"What?\" he called back. He was starting to get pretty far away, so I had to keep things short. \"Get on the train!\" I said my hands over the roof of my mouth. \"What?!\" he repeated, quieter. \"Get on the train!\" It turned out that he didn't hear me. Sadly, I walked over my seat next to Holly, and she was pretty startled that I came back. \"What were you trying to do?\" she asked. \"I wanted that boy to get on the train, but he\" I stopped speaking once I heard a loud thump on the nearby staircase. I balanced my way over, because the train was moving really fast, and found the boy on his knees! Maybe it was I who convinced him, or something else. But eathier way I was glad he was able to make it. \"Let me help\" I offered, reaching out my hand for him to grab. A small smile creeped on his face as I pulled him aboard. However, he just left and sat down after I helped him, not even one thank you. Mph, he could have at least been grateful I didn't push him off… Growling, I sat on my old seat next to Holly, and she curiously looked at the boy. He had short dark brown hair, and wore a blue robe similar to mine, and yellow pyjamas. Nothing interesting was featured hear, especially since he was very rude to me. \"Do you see that boy over there?\" Holly asked me. \"Yes, the one who didn't say thank you to me once I helped him. I should have pulled him off the train\" I muttered, and Holly heard me. \"Why would you want to do that?\" \"Because he didn't say thank you, he wasn't being polite\" I explained. \"Maybe he is upset and doesn't want to talk?\" Holly suggested. \"He should have at least nodded in a way that said thank you\" I informed her. After a while, we started looking at him a few times. I at least tried to look normal, but Holly was being a little to welcoming. I noticed the boy was looking at her weirdly. \"Holly? Aren't you being a little too… smily?\" I asked her. \"I am trying to be friendly. That boy looks so lonely, sitting alone in the compartment\" Holly said, being sympathetic. \"I think he's okay\" I told her, because from what he did to me, I didn't think he was going to make friends anytime soon. \"You should talk to him\" Holly suggested. \"Why? I don't want to be friends with him, especially since he was rude to me\" I said, folding my arms. \"Come on, he may not be that bad once you get to know him. My grandma always said never judge a book by its cover\" Holly quoted. \"Wise Grandma. Okay, I'll do it. But if he turns out to be rude, I'm coming right back here\" I took a deep breath, and slowly walked up to the boy. He looked at me, and our eyes met. We stared so deep into each other's eyes that it became really awkward. Another breath and I made the decision. I wasn't going to go back now. I kept thinking, and thinking, and this was just ridiculous! He was just a boy! Why was I so nervous to speak to him?! Alright, I promised myself. My adventure was about to begin. \"Hi,\" I said, loud and clear. The boy turned his head and stared at me a few seconds.[Chapter 4] \"Hi\" he replied, only quieter, and he started giving me this weird look, almost as if asking why I was here. \"Do you need anything?\" he asked, his eyebrow raised. I gulped. Did I really need anything, or did Holly just want me to talk to him? I turned around, and she nodded, smiling. \"Well, mind if I sit here? My friend needed some time by herself\" I turned back to Holly, and she shrugged while nodding. Did that mean that was a good answer? I hoped so. The boy looked at me awkwardly, in suspicion almost. \"Uh… Sure\" he managed to say. He scooted over for me to sit down, and I immediately felt uncomfortable. It was just so quiet and disturbing. The way he also looked at me in the corner of his eye made me feel uncomfortable. That was, until someone just had to say something. \"Hey you!\" the Eddie kid said rather abruptly. We both looked up and saw Eddie staring down at us. \"What?\" I asked, in unison as the boy said something else. \"Train. Do you know what kind of train it is?\" Eddie repeated. I looked at him confused until I just recently remembered my Grandfather gave me a big book on trains as a kid. He was a transporter, actually. So he knew a lot about trains. \"Some sort of….\" I paused, examining the structure of the train. Meanwhile, Holly replied to Eddie that it was a magic train. If it even was taking us to the North Pole, I knew it was a Baldwin something, something… Locomotive. \"Sure it's a magic train\" I started, quoting Holly. \"But it's a Baldwin blah blah blah Locomotive\" The new boy, and Holly laughed at my little joke, and Eddie looked at me in a disturbing way. \"Oh, I know it's a magic train\" he replied, annoyed. \"Actually, you were pretty close Lily. It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class steam locomotive built in 1931…\" He rambled on and on about the train. Brunette haired boy looked at me and Holly, rolling his eyes at Eddie. I made a 'copycat' sign I used on my sister when she was talking too much. It basically was mocking her loudness and eventually got her frustrated. \"I'm Lily, by the way\" I said, gesturing for the boy to shake my hand. \"I'm Chris\" he replied. Finally, I was able to call him something other than the boy, or brunette haired boy, or some other weird name. After a moment of silence, Chris turned to Holly. \"Is this train really going to the North Pole?\" he questioned. Chris turned to me, giving me a look that said, ' her name is…?' \"Holly\" I acknowledged, and he repeated her name loud enough to hear. She nodded, smiling in delight. \"Yes, isn't it wonderful?\" she asked. \"Well, only if you believe in that sort of thing\" I mentioned. I looked at Chris, and he nodded, meaning that must have had a case of the Disbelievers, like me. And that was why I was here, to finally get a glimpse of what was the supposed North Pole. \"Why don't you believe?\" Holly asked. This girl was really curious. \"Well, she was Christian. You know, you have to be Christian to celebrate Christmas. She died when I was little, and Christmas hasn't been the same really\" I explained, looking down. I probably shouldn't have said it. Now they were going to feel sorry for me, but then again, I couldn't make up a reason, I just never tried to lie. \"I'm sorry about that. But doesn't your Dad celebrate Christmas?\" \"No, he's Jewish and Jewish people celebrate-\" I was about to continue, but I was interrupted by Mr. Know It All Boy. \"Hankkah\" he concluded for me. \"Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah, with the menorah and everything!\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yes, thank you Mr. Know it all\" I said, being sarcastic-on purpose. That was when Eddie rolled his eyes and sat back down on his seat, while the others laughed. \"Finally, someone mentions it\" Chris exclaims, and Holly smiles in reply. \"Anyways, yeah. He never really knew how to celebrate Christmas\" The area between us got quiet, until Chris spoke up. \"Sorry about your Mom\" he said, and patted my shoulder. I nodded in reply. More silence kicked in until the kid yelled out from his seat. \"Hey, everyone!\" he called out. \"Look! Look out the windows! We're passing Macy's!\" That kid was definitely the loudest on the train, guaranteed. Almost immediately, all the kids looked out their windows, and stared at the beautiful lights and decorations. I stood near Chris who was gazing through the same window I was. I had my nose glued to the icy covered glass. The trees covered in lights were really beautiful, and made me feel all warm inside. But that mechanic Santa made me feel so weird. The mechanical wheel thingy in the back of the robotic Santa made me shake my head in laughter. I turned to Chris. \"Imagine if that was the real Santa Clause?\" He chuckled in response. \"I suppose the jolly man wouldn't have been so jolly\" \"Carrying those presents would have hurt his back\" I observed the other children, and they were much louder than Chris and I. All their cheers made me feel like I was missing out. I noticed him looking at me, observing how I was watching the children. \"You wish you were like them, huh?\" he asked. I didn't know what to say. Did I wish I was like them? Not having to worry about a thing, not knowing much about reality? \"By means of having fun, I guess so. But I am glad to have some sort of sense of what goes on around the world\" Those kids made believing seem so easy, yet for me it was so hard. I always knew that nothing could be proven without seeing it, and just believing it doesn't seem easy. Where was all the scientific proof? I could have argued with Eddie and the conductor all day, until I heard the conductor's footsteps getting louder. ","Summary":" Every year, I waited for him to come, but he never came.

As I finally awoke from what I wasn't sure but seemed a very tense scene, I could see that Edward and the rest of the Cullen family were all standing in the room . I sat up dazed and confused, trying to figure out what had happened over what seemed like the most painful hours of my life which were now very blurred memories. \"Edward? Carlisle?\" I whispered. \"Bella? Bella\" I was relieved to hear the beautiful sound of his ringing voice. But just then I noticed that my voice hadn't sounded a lot different from his. As the other cautious family members approached me, I noticed a terrible thirst which was making my throat burn In a strange, fiery way. That was the thing that was bothering me the most though. Idid not feel the slightest bit hungry. But as I lifted my head, all my family was watching me in an unusual way, which made me feel kind of uncomfortable . \"er you look different Bella\" Alice said, uncertainly looking at the others encouragingly. She sighed and gave up soon after because everyone else was speechless. \"actually Bella, you look amazing\" I was just as speechless as everyone else. I new what they were talking about. \"Bella I think you may be in for a bit of a shock honey\" Esme whispered n her ear. Slowly with some help from Alice, I made my way to the mirror, in the bathroom. And there it was. The reflection of a young adult, no older than eighteen, with long dark, Brown hair, pale, white skin and eyes that belong to a demon. I stepped back in disbelief. Recognition kicked in when I saw that my skin was the same as the other Cullen's. But why were my eyes different? \"Bella? Are you okay?\" carlisle asked awkwardly. \"fine\" was all I could manage at the moment. \"are you sure?\" Edward asked. \"yes, I like it. Its definitely different.\" I answered, while still casually looking in the mirror. \"whoa!\" I exclaimed. \" that was weird\" I wondered aloud, ignoring the worried stares I could sense behind me. \"what? Bella are you sure your alright?\" Edward repeated worried now. It was voices, she was hearing voices. \" have I gone mad? Even as a vampire? Can vampires go mad?\" questions blurred through my mind as I tried to answer them all. \"i wonder what her power will be I heard Carlisles voice, but no-one else has answered him. \"her emotions are quite calm and easy to control.\" this time it was Jasper. \"oh my god\" I whispered to myself, forgetting that there were other people in the room. \"what is it?\" Edward murmured quietly. \"i just heard Carlise and Jasper...\" my voice trailed off in confusion and shock. \"what do you mean?\" Jasper demanded. I jumped at the sound of his voice. Which again didn't sound as beautiful as it should have done or used to. \"Carlise said he wonders what my powers will be and you said that my emotions were calm and easy to handle...\" I trailed off again, in thought. \"but how is that possible? They never said anything.\" Esme wondered. This time Carlisle spoke. \"whatever this is, we need to work out what it is. I have a faint idea but I can't be certain. I felt Edward stiffen, beside me. \" Carlisle could that happen?\" Edward asked concerned, he had his arm round me as if trying to protect me from something that wasn't there. \"i don't know but lets not make assumptions, we will just have to see what comes\" \"okay, explain please\" I said uncertainly. \"Carlisle reckons that you might have the same power as me because I changed you\" Edward reassured me, kissing my forehead. \"Bella you must tell us if you hear anymore voices okay?\" Carlisle urged. \"of course.\" \"Bella would you like to come hunting with me?\" Edward asked. \"er okay I guess\" I answered. \"what was I meant to do? I had no idea how to hunt\" Edward laughed at my expression, which I couldn't hide. \"its okay Bella. It's easy, I'll show you first and you can copy. Anyway your instincts will kick in soon anyway.\" \"oh, okay\". The couple set off into the woods. I had never heard anything like it. It was like the woods were alive at there approach. I could hear everything around me. All the animals, the wind even the trees brushing together. \"would you like too run with me?\" Edward grinned at her. \"sure, I guess.\" and before I new it Edward had grabbed my hand and we were sprinting through the trees. I no longer felt the travel sickness I had before. It was nice having the wind blowing through my hair. Edward was right though. There was soon a different scent in the air and so my new instincts kicked in and I was soon on their trail. When I arrived at the herd of deer I crouched low into a hunting position and sensed that I was not alone. Then something strange happened. In the defense of my hunt a low but clearly audible growl erupted from my chest and then became a snarl. My lips pulling back over my teeth, unleashing the full glare of my crimson, red eyes. Edward didn't seem to flinch at the sound, so we proceeded with our hunting trip. As soon as the deer flinched, I leaped into view forgetting everything and everyone else around me. The dear heard everything and tried to get away but I wouldn't let that happen. I grabbed it and sunk my teeth into the warmest part of it's fur where the blood pulsed the most. It tasted good. It relieved some of the burning in my throat, but was not completely satisfying. I noticed Edward on the other side of the river, finishing off his third hunt. \"how do you do it so fast?\" I asked, amazed at how quick he was done \"years and years of practice. Though I guess I just enjoy it a lot to.\" he laughed. \" how was your first time?\" \"it was enjoyable\" I laughed along with him. \" are you still thirsty?\" \"well you were right when you said that it wasn't completely satisfying, but I think I'll live.\" she grinned at him. \" for now anyway\" The we walked slowly, hand in hand through the shaded woods, this time not running so we could take in the beauty around us. \"Bella\" Edward started. \"what?\" \"are you happy now? I mean you got what you wanted.\" \"yes, of course I'm happy. Why ask?\" \"tell me what your thinking Bella\" \"I'm thinking that my life is now more amazing then it ever has been\" \" but how can it be more amazing, when your like me?\" \"what?\" I asked. \"i didn't say anything\" Edward said slowly. \" yes you did I heard you. You said \" but how can it be more amazing when your like me?\" I looked at him expectantly. \"no I didn't.\" he said confused. \" I thought that though... we need to get back, explain this to Carlisle\" we were running now. But It wasn't as fun as it was before. Edward seemed deep in thought. As we were nearly into the clearing of our home, there was an awful smell. Edward must have been able to smell it too because we both stopped at the same time. \"oh did the dog come to join us for the hunt?\" Edward asked sarcastically \"or were you just lonely?\" he said clearly not talking to Bella anymore. \" I had to see what she was like\" said a very recognizable voice. \"Jacob?\" \"hey Bells\" the husky voice greeted. \"where were you when I woke up? I expected you to be there.\" \"i can't be at your aid all the time Bella, I have got my own life to think about too.\" that stung, a lot. Why was Jake angry with me? What had brought this on?. A million questions were going through my mind again, but this time I didn't stop to think. I knew when I was not wanted. So I ran. Back into the woods where I couldn't bother anyone else. I could hear Edward and Jacob's voices in the background. \"thank you Jacob, you know how sensitive she is\" \" well I didn't know what she would be like did I? Besides I was only telling the truth\". Edward sighed \" the truth can hurt Jacob, you should know that\" then he was running, following my scent. It took him a minute to catch up . \"Bella, stop\" he urged. \"why?\" I challenged him. \" because Jacob didn't mean what he said\" \"Edward I know when I'm not wanted by someone\" \" Jacob was just shocked that's all, and Bella I want you, more than anything in the world\" I slowed by a fraction. Edward sighed, happy with how he had dealt with the situation. \" but why would he say that if he didn't mean it?\" \"because Bella he's angry and confused\" he explained. \"oh\" I stopped suddenly, taking it all in. Edward, not expecting me to stop so abruptly, had to turn and walk back to me. He held me In his arms, for what seemed like a long time. Then he spoke \" Bella, you must understand that you will always be wanted here no matter what ok?\" but before I could answer he was kissing me. He did not have to be careful anymore. It was me that could hurt him. I will write the rest of the story soon please review. I need to know how I can improve. Thx for reading. :)[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 We were back at the Cullen's house, where everyone was just doing their own thing. Me and Edward were in his room, or our room as he now calls it. Entwined with one-another we were sat on the massive bed that Edward had brought for me when I was human,listening to his Debussy CD. \"I bet you must think that I'm some sort of freak vampire with a glitch\" I chuckled. \" of course I don't think that. It might be just your own special power coming on love. It could be anything.\" \" yeah I guess so.\" I agreed reluctantly. I was paying attention to what Edward, but in my mind I was deep in thought. \"what did this mean?\" I wondered. \"first I was hearing Jasper and Carlisle's thoughts and now Edwards\" This couldn't get any weirder. Right now though I had to concentrate on being with Edward and trying to convince Rosalie that it was safe for me to hold Renesmee because I wasn't after her blood. Thanks for reading.

Abrio la puerta de su cuarto y me tiro con fuerza a su cama gracias a dios no me paso nada Quítate la ropa o te golpeo- me dijo amenazante Yo quitándome mi suéter temblando,mirando algo que podría ocupar punzante para pegarle o algo para que dejara de molestarme y vi una tijera en el modular de atrás de su cama , la agarre y la puse atrás de mi espalda Mientras Jacob estaba distraído,cuando yo iba por mi brasier por quitármelo Jacob miro y se me ocurrió una idea muy buena Sabes amigo tienes razón nunca te di la oportunidad- dije seximente - te gustaría que mientras me saco la ropa te hago un baile mi amor?- dije El solamente asintió empeze a bailarle sensualmente con mi mano atrás con la tijera en ella Pasaron unos minutos y Me termine desnudando y me acerqué a que me acariciara y después yo ir por atrás y clavarle la tijera en la espalda Sentí un asco profundo a sentir sus caricias Hasta que me toco a mi acariciarlo,ahora era mi momento de escapar Me fui por atrás de el,le saque la camisa Y... Capitulo 19-No es lo que parece ","Summary":" Prólogo Mi vida de porrista es un poco difícil ya que tenia una enemiga y se ganaba a todos los chi"},{"Movie":"Polar Express","Title":"Wish of the Polar Express","Author":"Norwesterner","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5608171","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Preface When we're children, Christmas perhaps starts out as bright, busy, but confusing. Later it becomes about presents, excitement, Christmas trees, and Santa Claus . . . bringing presents. But just as what we want for Christmas changes as we grow, so does the Season itself and its meaning. Stuff tends to become less important as we gather more of that each Christmas — while feelings, experiences, and perhaps an indefinable sense of togetherness and even love, seem to take on more importance, even urgency if we feel we don't have them. For some of us, Christmastime sometimes only reminds us of what we don't have, but want deep within ourselves. We then at times hope, even unconsciously, for someone or something to either bring to us, or take us to, what we truly want. Fortunately, author Chris Van Allsburg and Warner Brothers Entertainment, who own the 'Polar Express' and its characters from the book and film respectively, have created a marvelous vehicle and means to do just that at Christmas. So I invite you to join a boy, who has now become a man, as he takes an unexpected second trip from an increasingly hard everyday world on a train that will not only bring him someplace, but to someone, he didn't even know he wanted for Christmas. Enjoy . . . — Norwesterner I was running for my train. I had just made it to the snowy platform of Van Buren Street Station where I normally boarded the 5:35 evening South Shore train out of Chicago. The sheltered platforms were offering little protection tonight though from the winds and snow blowing off of nearby Lake Michigan. Almost within reach of warmth and shelter on the train, I suddenly found myself slipping and falling as its doors were starting to close. My head hit hard against the frozen platform, and things went dark. When I came to, my train was gone, and I was alone. The winds and snow were strangely diminished, and now blowing gently. Everything was now quiet, but at least I wasn't aching from my fall on the platform like I thought I would be. Just my luck, I thought. I had been laid off from my job at a Chicago commodities trading firm the previous week. It wasn't a perfect job, and I wasn't sure after this second job loss in several years if I had all that much of a knack for commodities and options trading. But the loss of it, especially around Christmas, was hard . . . and it hurt. I kept commuting to Chicago from my home in Beverly Shores, Indiana though on my monthly South Shore pass, seeking job leads and interviews anyway. Nothing had panned out however. I had just completed another interview today, on Christmas Eve no less, where I was told guys with MBA degrees in Finance were a dime a dozen now. I hadn't told my sister, Sarah, or my parents about my situation yet. I had only told them that I was busy and wouldn't be able to come home for Christmas this year. Fact was though that I'd spent about the last of my ready cash on my monthly home mortgage payment. I liked my house, because it was both attractive, and it was near the tracks. Ever since my ride on the Polar Express years ago, I had wanted to live near trains — in a nice neighborhood, but near trains. Now at last, after saving for years as a junior trader and accounts manager, I had such a home . . . and I didn't want to give it up. The Polar Express. My ride on that train seemed so long ago. But I still had the sleigh bell I had both found and had been given during that ride — and I could still hear it. But now, I was the only one I knew of who could. While the rest of Christmas this year was seeming to collapse in disappointment, for some reason that bell still rang for me. Sitting up on the now lonely, dark, and snowy platform before carefully rising to my feet once more, I re-slung my laptop bag over my shoulder, hoping the computer inside wasn't damaged by my fall. However, I couldn't hear the normal sounds of the city around me. Just the gently blowing wind off Lake Michigan. I looked at a clock on the platform that seemed to be frozen at the wrong time — ten minutes before midnight. That clock was clearly broken, I thought, as I'd only just missed my 5:35 PM South Shore train . . . right? Then I began to hear something. Another train was approaching. It seemed a bit soon to be the next South Shore train, however. Likely it was a Metra Electric headed only as far as South Chicago. But it didn't hum quietly like the electric commuter trains that ran on this line. This approaching train chuffed. Then suddenly, a whistle blew loudly, practically right next to me — scaring me out of my skin as it announced the train's arrival. I now found myself enveloped on the platform for a moment by clouds of warm steam. When the white clouds of vapor began clearing, I was next to what seemed like a black wall. It was made of riveted metal, and had white letters on it . . . P . . . O . . . L . . . A . . . R . . . Wait a minute . . . that wasn't possible. I was about to continue reading the rest of the letters obscured by steam towards what clearly sounded like a steam locomotive, when a nearby voice caused me to look the other way, towards the rear of the train. \"All aboaaaaard!\" the voice said. \"No,\" I said out loud, shaking my head. I must have hit my head really hard on the platform. \"All aboaaaaard!\" the voice repeated. \"Wait, you mean me?\" I asked, walking towards what seemed like the train's conductor. \"Well . . . 'ya comin'?\" he asked in reply. \"You're really here . . . to pick me up? Aren't I a little old for this?\" I asked right back. I no longer needed to ask where the train was going. \"Hold this please,\" he said, passing me his lantern, as he reached inside the train car's door for his clipboard. \"You're right. We normally don't pick your sort up,\" he said, looking at his clipboard. \"Exceptions are sometimes allowed however, for unfulfilled wishes made at Christmas — but only for those who still believe in what we do around here. Looks like you made the list though, according to what I'm reading. And we are making an extra run here, just for those with such wishes.\" \"I am out of a job, and I have been wishing for another one, and I need cash from somewhere if I'm gonna even buy groceries next week . . .\" I started to tally up out loud. \"Oh, but you didn't wish that to Mr. C, Santa,\" the Conductor crisply noted. \"Besides, we're not here to pick you up because of a wish you made anyway . . . but for a wish someone else made.\" That made me do a double-take. \"But if I were you,\" he said just inches from my face now, \"I would think about getting on board.\" This was just too much for me to handle. Here I was, about to get on a train that I had remembered was meant for children, to see the North Pole and Santa. A train that my now grown-up and rational mind had trouble accepting as real . . . and a train that was apparently here to pick me up, not even because I wished it, but because someone else had. \"Sorry,\" I found myself saying as I shook my head and began backing away on the platform. \"Suit yourself,\" the conductor sighed. \"But you won't be the one you disappoint . . . and not for the first time either.\" He stepped into the train car's doorway and waved his lantern up and down to the engineer, and then moved fully inside the car. \"What'cha have 'ta lose?\" a voice seemingly asked all around me, before the soft, wind-driven snow swirled and formed into the train's hobo that I remembered from all those years ago. He was suddenly standing next to me now. \"If 'ya don't get on . . . your next stop could be lookin', and livin', like me.\" For some reason, the suddenly all-too-real prospect of living like a homeless hobo compelled my feet to move. My hand grabbed the rail beside the train car's door, and I practically swung myself into the car as the train began to leave the station. I now looked from the vestibule where I was into the train car's interior. Unlike the last time I had ridden the Polar Express however, this time there was no one else in the warmly-lit coach, except the conductor now looking back at me through a glass porthole in the door. He now slid open the door that separated us. \"Mind if I sit in the Observation Parlor Car this time?\" I asked. \"We don't get those on the normal commuter trains I ride these days.\" \"Suit yourself,\" he said once again. \"But your ticket, please.\" I remembered this part. I checked first my right overcoat pocket. No ticket. Then I checked the left pocket in my overcoat. No ticket either. \"Keep checking,\" the conductor curtly noted with a little exasperation. I checked the pockets in my suit jacket under the overcoat. No ticket. \"Try the one closest to you,\" he suggested, looking away, \" . . . to your heart.\" Betraying a very puzzled look on my face, my right hand reached past my overcoat and jacket for the pocket in my shirt. There it detected something that felt like foil. I produced it . . . a ticket, embossed on red foil this time. The Polar Express — Extra Section ROUND TRIP . . . it read. \"Thank you,\" the conductor said as he took and began punching my newly found ticket. After his punching a blizzard of chads, just like I remembered, he handed my ticket back to me. \"AC\" he had punched out. \"You wouldn't tell me what this means now, would you?\" I asked. \"No, I would not,\" he replied. \"Are we picking up anyone else?\" I then asked. \"I am not sure,\" he mysteriously but deliberately answered. \"And we're going to the North Pole,\" I now queried. \"Not necessarily the same one you remember,\" he replied. \"Wait a minute,\" I objected. \"There's gotta be only one North Pole . . . isn't there?\" \"You are free to think that, sir,\" he replied, now turning away and walking to the next car. \"But that is not necessarily where this train is going.\" Almost before I had seated myself in the plush, green Parlor Car, I felt the train slow to a stop again. Even though the train had picked me up facing south, I recognized we had come to a neighborhood of nice lakeside apartment towers and classic brownstone townhomes in what was north Chicago. I also noticed that Lake Michigan was now on the train's right, not on the left as it normally would be if I were really bound for Indiana, and home. I was indeed headed north now. \"All aboaaaaard!\" the Conductor called, standing beside an open door of the train in the quiet, snowy neighborhood street. But no one came out of any of the townhomes or apartments. I noticed one light on though, in one third floor room, of one apartment tower. I could see a figure, a person, sitting near the window of that room in silhouette. It was tough to tell whether they were a he or a she, but they appeared to be grown up, like me. The person had their face in their hands though, and looked like they were crying. The scene reminded me of how I had felt at times in recent days — the fear, the uncertainty, the loneliness that had seemed to overwhelm me, amid what was supposed to be a joyous season. \"All aboaaaaard!\" the Conductor called out a second time. The figure in the window seemed to turn a little briefly towards the train, but kept their face buried in their hands. The person then turned facing back down, even perhaps away from the window. He or she could clearly see and hear the Polar Express. But they would not, or could not, come down to board it. \"All aboaaaaard!\" the Conductor called a third and final time. I went forward to the doorway of the next car where the Conductor was. When I got there, I saw him just looked at his watch, shrug and sigh a little, and waive his lantern up and down to the Engineer. The locomotive now whistled twice, and I felt the train jerk forward. \"They're not coming?\" I said, noting the obvious. \"Well, you can watch, and pull the Emergency Brake — like you did the last time — if you do see them coming,\" the Conductor replied, almost seeming to hope that such a thing would happen as he began closing the stair trap and door. \"But otherwise, no . . . they're not coming.\" \"Was that the someone who wished for me to be here . . . on this train?\" I asked. \"I . . . I am not at liberty to say, sir,\" the Conductor replied with surprising hesitancy, almost seeming to conceal a sadness now. \"But the last time we scheduled this run in answer to the wish, we picked up the someone else, but did not pick you up. So now, things are reversed. Still, it's not a way I like to run this railroad.\" Now I was intrigued. \"Could you tell me when that was? Could you tell me anything more? Anything at all?\" \"No, I'm sorry sir, I could not,\" the Conductor replied flatly. I was disappointed, yet curious — racking my brain to figure out when I might have possibly seen the Polar Express in recent years, but not boarded it. \"But,\" he said, now trying to change the subject, and even seemingly recover from his own disappointment, \"are you in need of refreshment?\" \"Well . . . I suppose so,\" I said, warming up to the idea of a hot chocolate, especially one I remembered tasting so good on this train all those years ago. \"Seat yourself in the Parlor Car then, sir,\" he replied as he now walked away, \"and it will be brought right to you.\" So I now turned myself back towards the Parlor Observation Car at the rear of the train, and seated myself near the big, curved windows at the far end, where I could watch the tracks recede into the distance amid the dark, bleak, snowy landscape. Any trace of Chicago and its environs had already disappeared. Some snow-covered trees and gently rolling hills of what appeared to be the Canadian Shield seemed like all there was outside now. Looking out the windows from my lounge chair, I then waited for the tap-dancing, hot chocolate-tossing chefs and waiters I remembered from my previous ride on the Polar Express. \"Nice digs you picked here,\" a voice suddenly said behind me. I whipped my head around to find the hobo now seated next to me. \"Here, have an Irish Coffee this time,\" he offered as he passed a steaming mug to me. \"I promise it's not my usual cup'a Joe, and it'll warm you up a whole lot more than hot chocolate will!\" \"Where are the tap-dancing waiters?\" I asked as I accepted the mug from him. \"You really need to see them?\" he asked in reply. \"Well, I kinda expected it,\" I answered as I tentatively took my first sip. \"Just because something happens once,\" the hobo said, \"you expect it to happen again?\" \"No, not necessarily,\" I defended. \"Down on your luck?\" he now said, changing the subject. \"Or are you still chasing skirt, like you were the last time I saw 'ya?\" \"Yes on the former . . . but no on the latter,\" I said looking down, now feeling stung by both questions. \"But I really don't want to talk about either of those.\" \"Interesting,\" he observed. \"You have something to tell me? Some profound piece of insight?\" I asked with a degree of irritation at being reminded of my current misfortunes in both my work and love lives. \"Me?\" he answered. \"I'm just your waiter . . . or your bartender. Take your pick.\" \"That's just my luck,\" I noted. \"No straight answers once again. I've been getting that in my job interviews all week here.\" \"Always lookin' for the easy stuff, eh?\" he replied. \"Well, someone gave you practically the easiest, most obvious answer in the world once. But you didn't see it.\" \"Who? What?\" I asked. \"It ain't up 'ta me 'ta tell 'ya,\" he replied as he now disappeared. I was now left alone with even more questions than answers as the train continued rolling along. At least the Irish Coffee I had been given was indeed good and warming. It even had a kick to it — a somewhat alcoholic 'hot chocolate' for grown-ups, I mused.[Chapter 2] Unlike the last time I had ridden the Polar Express, I didn't feel the need to wander around the train this time, or find myself in trouble. For some strange reason, the terrain the train passed through seemed a whole lot flatter and uneventful as well . . . just dark, featureless, snowy land all around for as far as the eye could see. \"Conductor,\" I said, stopping him as he made his rounds and checks through my car now, \"this trip is not like I remember. The landscape seems different. Where are the mountains and valleys? Where's Flattop Tunnel, or . . . or Glacier Gulch?\" I stammered as I struggled to remember the names of the places I had been on this train so long ago. \"As I said, sir,\" he replied, \"we're not necessarily going to the same North Pole you remember. So the route may not be as you remember, either. Your perspective has changed, and so has what you see around you. At least you're not as much trouble this time as you used to be.\" \"That's why everything's flatter and less dramatic, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"It's because my life, and my possibilities, seem that way, too.\" \"If you say so, sir,\" the Conductor responded. \"It doesn't seem like we're picking anyone else up besides the one we missed, are we?\" I now asked. \"Nope,\" the Conductor answered. \"That other passenger we were expecting gave up.\" \"Gave up? Why?\" I asked. \"No one is obligated to make this trip, even if they once wished to,\" he replied. \"So, am I making this whole trip for nothing then?\" I almost demanded. \"That, sir, is up to you,\" the Conductor replied before resuming his rounds and turning back to the next car forward. — — — — — The whole journey now seemed bleaker . . . as bleak as the flat, dark, and frozen landscape outside the train. I had no companions to share it with, other than the Conductor and the hobo I'd seen at times so far. Not the geeky kid who annoyed me, not the shy little kid whom I had helped, and certainly not the girl who had initially been staring and smiling at me, and with whom I had wound up sharing much of my previous experience on the Polar Express. I often wondered what had happened to them all. I even at times wished I had thought to exchange addresses and phone numbers with them, allowing us all to keep in touch somehow. Part of me even wondered if they were any more real than the train had seemed to be. \"Bored?\" a now familiar voice asked behind me. \"This trip does seem to be less eventful than the last one I took on this train,\" I noted. \"Why do 'ya think that is?\" the hobo asked, having once again appeared in the armchair next to me. \"I don't quite know,\" I replied. \"I'm certainly not seeing you on the roof of this car, or on the front of the locomotive, like I did the last trip,\" he noted. \"That's why I is havin' to come in here like I am.\" \"Well, I don't have any reasons to be out there this time, like I was the last trip,\" I answered. \"No one to help or save, or even to return a lost ticket to.\" \"Miss that, do 'ya?\" he asked. \"Getting in trouble? Almost falling off this train? No, not really,\" I replied. \"Playin' it safe,\" he surmised. \"It's what grown-ups get good at.\" \"No, I take risks every day,\" I countered. \"Or I used to, until I got laid off.\" \"What? Bettin' which way a ton of pork or a barrel 'a oil is gonna go, price-wise?\" he mocked. \"Call that takin' a risk, do 'ya?\" \"It's what probably got me laid off!\" I pointedly responded. \"I likely took too many risks with the commodity positions I was responsible for trading . . . lost too much money for the firm I was with.\" \"I see,\" he said. \"You want a little more excitement 'round here though?\" \"No,\" I decided, remembering some of my precarious adventures on this train from before, \"this car seems nice enough to me this time.\" \"You're missin' out,\" he warned. \"This trip will be over before 'ya know it, and 'ya won't have seen a thing from inside these windows.\" Then he was gone again. \"Well,\" I then thought out loud, \"while I don't feel like hanging off the outside of this train, maybe I should see the rest of it inside — if nothing else than to prove this hobo wrong.\" So, leaving my laptop bag behind in the Parlor Car, as no other passengers were apparently onboard, I walked into the next car forward. Unlike my last trip on this train, I crossed easily between the cars this time. There was no daunting, icy, treacherous chasm of a gap between the cars as there had been on my last trip. Crossing between cars seemed all too easy and uneventful now. Maybe it was because I was now bigger, I thought. When I slid open the door into the next car, I found it was just an empty coach, as I had seen before . . . as was the next car ahead of it, and the one after that. Then there was a dark car further ahead. Having come all this way through the train, I just had to check this last car out. \"The toy car,\" I said in recognition, as I entered this car's dim confines. It was filled with dirty, broken, discarded toys — just like I remembered from my previous trip years ago on this train. In fact, they seemed to even be the same toys I remembered. There was the Scrooge puppet the hobo had once tormented me with, and over there was the doll in the white dress that had seemed to touch the heart of the girl I was with on my previous journey aboard the Polar Express. Curiously though, I hadn't noticed the last time that the doll was in fact wearing a wedding dress and veil. I had never picked up a doll in my life. But something compelled me to pick up this one. I looked at the doll for a moment as I held it in one hand. The doll did seem so sad, just as the girl had once said. But this doll's eyes seemed to have a spark of hope still in them. Something made me want to take it with me . . . if nothing else than to seemingly give it, and the hope it seemed to have, a chance to finally escape this dreary car. \"Playing with dolls, are we?\" a voice behind me seemed to mock. I turned around. But neither the hobo nor the Conductor were there. Just the puppets and other toys. \"No,\" I answered the voice that was addressing me. I now took the doll and tucked it in the left pocket of my overcoat anyway, almost to spite whomever was apparently mocking me. \"Just experiencing a memory . . . a feeling. Maybe even giving someone, or something, a chance,\" I defended. \"Now that's takin' a risk,\" the hobo remarked as he appeared among the puppets suspended from the car's ceiling. \"Don't know if I'd be seen with a doll hangin' out of my pocket.\" \"Well, I don't mind being seen with one in my pocket,\" I replied. \"Maybe it deserves a chance. Maybe even a new home, outside this car.\" Taking that doll now felt right to me . . . more right than ever. For some reason, I felt emboldened, even freer. No, I wasn't about to start playing with dolls, I found myself defending to even my own rational mind. But I felt I should take the doll with me . . . although I couldn't explain why. \"Seein' that you're more open to takin' risks here,\" the hobo noted, \"we've still got one thing outside on this trip 'ya might enjoy seein'. Care 'ta come with me?\" \"Why not!\" I suddenly found myself saying, almost with a smile. We then exited the front of the car, and climbed up on the rear of the locomotive's tender. \"Now this is the way 'ta travel!\" the hobo said as the winds and snow whipped all around us, even though I wasn't cold. \"Well,\" he continued, almost with a devilish grin now looking forward, \"looks like we haven't missed Homestake Pass and Glacier Gulch yet after all! Care 'ta enjoy the best view in the house with me?\" \"Yeah!\" I now agreed, with a growing grin of my own. We now clambered over the tender, jumping seemingly unnoticed onto the roof of the locomotive's cab. \"Let's go forward on the Fireman's side catwalk,\" the hobo suggested, pointing to the left side of the locomotive. \"He's too busy shovelin' coal to be lookin' out his side!\" We slid down the locomotive's curved boiler casing to the Fireman's catwalk and worked our way along to the front. As we passed its smokebox and stack, I could hear, see, and feel the engine chugging hard up Homestake Pass — its metal heart and muscles seeming to beat and work not just underneath my feet and hands, but all around me. \"Right this way,\" he invited as we stepped down onto the small platform of locomotive's front pilot, just as we were passing the 'DANGER 179° GRADE' and 'USE LOW GEAR' signs at the top of the rise. \"Like old times, eh!\" the hobo yelled to me as the train began its precipitous descent down the incredibly steep tracks. \"Yeah!\" I said with enjoyment, having not experienced a thrill like this since I had 'grown up'. I gripped the safety bar firmly, but I was now smiling all the way down as the train once again plunged down a near-vertical drop. I then felt my body pressed, almost slammed towards the deck as the tracks suddenly leveled out and shot upward again towards the sky and over the second rise, only to practically float off the pilot again as the train plunged down another steep downward grade, with the passing tracks, ties, and surrounding mountain pinnacles all becoming a momentary blur. \"Wow!\" I said as the train finally leveled out and slowed back to a more normal speed, feeling a deep sense of renewed life in me, almost rediscovery. I added a second \"Wow!\" . . . just because. \"Feeling good are 'ya?\" the hobo asked, still beside me. \"Yeah, I am,\" I admitted with a smile. \"Best I've felt in a while . . . even a long time.\" \"So why have 'ya waited so long 'ta feel good like this again?\" he asked. \"I don't know,\" I replied, still catching my breath somewhat. \"I got busy — first studying, then earning a living.\" \"You were earning a living, but 'ya forgot 'ta live it?\" the hobo noted. \"Yeah . . . I guess maybe I did,\" I replied with a sudden feeling of regret, even sadness now as I looked down. \"So, what'ya gonna do about it?\" he followed up. \"What do you mean?\" I replied. \"Regrets get 'ya nowhere,\" the hobo observed. \"Hey, I've been going places, doing things!\" I defended with a bit of irritation, even anger. \"But are they the right things?\" he asked. Suddenly, I couldn't answer him. \"Hey,\" I now remarked instead, trying to change the subject, \"where's the lake or river that I remember freezing over the tracks right about here?\" There was no answer. The hobo had disappeared, as had the lake or river that the train had once skidded over and threatened to fall into. The hobo's question, \"But are they the right things?\" now echoed in my mind though, leaving me wondering as I just sat on the locomotive's pilot with my feet over the cow catcher in front, looking down at the tracks as the train continued to thunder ahead into the arctic night. Suddenly, something emerged in my mind. Something I had thought about having . . . something I had even thought I did have at times in the past, but now in hindsight realized I didn't. It was one 'right thing' that I now wanted to have, especially this Christmas. And it was something I now strangely felt ready to ask for, if I got the chance, when I arrived at the North Pole.[Chapter 3] \"There you are!\" I now heard a voice say over my shoulder as I continued to enjoy the view from the front pilot of the locomotive. \"Trying to get into trouble again?\" \"Nope,\" I said, almost with a smile as I now turned my head and looked up at the Conductor. \"Something just led me through the train and up here, and I'm now glad I came.\" \"Well, we do want our passengers to have a pleasant trip. A trip that pleases them,\" he stated with a degree of officiousness, but yet sincerity, too. \"Hey, is that the North Pole over there?\" I asked, now seeing a concentration of light ahead but off to the right, amid a sea of darkness and ice. \"Yes, that's our destination,\" the Conductor confirmed. \"But where are the brick railroad bridges . . . and the brick buildings?\" I now asked as the train seemed to start riding upon a viaduct, a bridge that seemed to be made of little more than light itself. \"Things aren't quite so sure, so solid, for the few grown-up passengers we get,\" the Conductor replied. \"Our route and destination reflect that.\" \"Will I see Santa . . . Mr. C?\" I asked as I now rose and stood up on the locomotive's pilot. \"You will see what you want to here . . . and what you're ready to,\" the Conductor mysteriously said. \"I would choose wisely.\" \"But sir,\" he now said, changing tone, \"we do not disembark passengers from the locomotive. So I would please ask you to return to your car, or to any other coach in the train for disembarkation.\" \"Sure,\" I smiled as I stepped up to and walked back along the Fireman's catwalk beside the locomotive's black boiler casing as he followed behind me. I climbed up and onto the cab, and then stopped and turned to the Conductor. \"You know,\" I said to him, \" . . . there is one thing I wanted to do on this train. Something I never did. Would you and the railroad mind terribly if I could do it now? I might never get another chance.\" For a change, the Conductor actually smiled at me. I was shocked. He simply gestured with a hand, ushering me down into the locomotive's warm cab. \"Steamer,\" the Conductor now said to the Engineer, \"we have a guest . . . who would like to do something. Something to help out here on the final leg of this trip as we approach our destination.\" The Engineer looked at the Conductor, and at me. Then he just gently smiled as he rose out of his seat. He gestured with a hand, now offering it to me! With a smile I could barely contain, I now approached and sat myself down . . . in the Engineer's seat of the Polar Express' dark and mighty 2-8-4 Berkshire steam locomotive. \"Feel free to open up the throttle just a bit more,\" the Engineer now coached, \"and let 'em know we're comin', too.\" I reached up in front of me, squeezed the grip on the throttle, and pushed it further forward slightly. I felt the steam course more powerfully through the locomotive as it picked up a little more speed. I then reached for that cord on my left . . . that magic, all-important cord. I pulled it — both hearing and feeling the deep, sweet chimes of the whistle a few feet ahead of me as I did. I pulled the cord several more times, causing the great whistle to give out long, resonant calls. Nothing . . . no other moment, had now felt so right, so deeply joyful to me in my life. For some reason, I now felt the doll in my left overcoat pocket again. I looked down and noticed it was about to fall out. I quickly reached down and tucked it back inside the pocket, hoping no one else in the cab would notice. But my left hand lingered on it for a moment, and I looked down at the doll there in my coat pocket. She seemed to be looking up at me, meeting my gaze with her glass eyes. Yes, I felt inside, this feeling . . . this combination. I couldn't explain it, or what it meant. \"We're approaching our destination,\" the Conductor observed to the Engineer as he looked out the Fireman's doorway. \"Right,\" the Engineer acknowledged. \"How about easing off on the throttle now and applying the train brake, just a couple notches. Also keep letting 'em know we're comin'!\" I now squeezed and pulled back on the throttle with my right hand, as my left hand pulled the brake handle as I had been encouraged to. I looked out the window as the train now approached what looked to be not a city of brick . . . but a city of light. Pure, multi-hued light. Structures, even figures . . . I don't know if they were people or elves, or even memories or figments of imagination . . . seemed to both emerge and blend back into the waves and patterns of light that were now beginning to surround the locomotive and train. \"What are those? What is all this?\" I now asked, as I gently slowed the train further, while sounding the whistle some more as well, almost like a seasoned railroader now. \"They are what you make them to be,\" the Conductor enigmatically replied again. \"Life, even Christmas, can be a little different for adults than it is for children. You get to choose what form, what meaning, it takes for you now.\" \"If I choose it to be as I remember . . .\" I began to say. Suddenly everything around us transformed into the familiar brick structures and warmly-lit windows of Santa's North Pole city that I recalled from my last trip on the Polar Express — right down to the hundreds, maybe thousands of elves, the Christmas wreaths and garlands all around, and the towering Christmas Tree now ahead of the train. \"I'm back!\" I almost tearfully said. \"I'm back.\" \"Yes, you are,\" the Conductor confirmed with a gentle smile. \"But come, once you stop this train, there are things here you should see. Things you should experience.\" \"Of course,\" I replied as I braked the train to a smooth stop. \"Give one short blast on the whistle to let everyone know the train is now stopped,\" the Engineer encouraged. I gave one short, crisp tug on the whistle cord, and was satisfied to hear the corresponding blast on the locomotive's steam whistle. \"Thank you. Thank you all,\" I said as I rose out of the Engineer's seat with a sigh of reluctance. \"This is practically a wonderful Christmas present right here.\" \"I hope it's not the only one you will ask for,\" the Conductor responded. I gave him a quizzical look, wondering what he had meant by that. \"Why don't we just make an exception, and allow you to disembark via the Engineer's ladder here down from the cab?\" The Conductor continued, seeming to dismiss the look I was giving him. \"Allow me to precede you,\" he suggested as he stepped out of the cab and climbed down the ladder first. I then stopped as I looked out of the doorway from the locomotive's cab for a moment. There it was, in all its rich glory, form, and substance — the North Pole, Christmas Town, Santa's City — whatever you might want to call it. Each of the many buildings was fringed, even infused with light. Crowds of elves were jumping and tumbling as they gathered around the sky-high Christmas Tree in the city's central plaza. This time, it all was familiar. A return, even a reunion for me. This time, I couldn't wait to be a part of it all! I turned and climbed smoothly down the locomotive's ladder. I then looked down nearing the bottom only to see myself plant a foot squarely not just on, but through, an elf! He suddenly disappeared amid a flash, almost a puff of light — not seeming to have even noticed me, or my foot passing through him. \"Wha-What goes on?\" I asked almost in shock as I now stepped onto the brick pavement at the bottom of the locomotive's ladder. \"As I said, sir,\" the Conductor replied, \"this is not the same North Pole that you remember. If you'll excuse me though, I have some paperwork to fill out while we're here.\" \"But what do I do? Where do I go?\" I asked, no longer sure of much of anything concerning where I was now. \"Explore, experience, realize,\" he encouraged. \"We don't provide escorted tours for grown-ups on these extra runs. It's not part of the package,\" he said in his clipped, formal way. \"When do we leave? How do I know when to get back?\" I asked. \"You will not miss this train, sir,\" he replied, just inches from my face again, \" . . . unless you choose to.\" That last comment sent a chill down my spine. The Conductor then turned and swiftly went back down alongside the train, boarding, almost disappearing, into a coach. Hoards of elves continued to walk past me, around me, and sure enough through me — or at least into me, disappearing in puffs of light as they encountered my legs. \"What do I do now?\" I wondered aloud, feeling almost lost in a city that no longer appeared as real as I had felt it to be even a few moments ago. \"You wanna get to the heart of the matter? Why you're here?\" a now familiar voice behind me asked. I turned to see the hobo next to me again. I looked down to see that the elves were going around him, and even bumping into his legs with objections like, \"Hey! Out of the way!\" and \"Move it!\" \"Want me to get rid of all this?\" he asked, seeming to be somewhat annoyed with the elves, and all the other trappings of what we both now knew was a reality that could be changed, practically at will, to suit our preferences. \"No airship and parachuting or bungee-jumping elves this time?\" I asked. \"Sure . . . if you want 'em,\" he offered as he pointed upwards beyond the giant Christmas Tree. Suddenly, there it all was — the twin-hulled airship with Santa's giant bag of presents, brushing the star off the Christmas tree with elves first parachuting off to lighten the load, and then bungee-jumping down to catch the falling star . . . all just as I remembered it. I thought I could even see my younger self and my friends, peering out from the top of Santa's bag. \"Are 'ya here just to see all that again?\" the hobo asked next to me. \"What am I here for then?\" I asked, turning to him. \"Now you're talkin'!\" he replied with a smile as everything around us vanished into waves of light that looked like the Northern Lights. Amid the undulating patterns of white and colored light now, I began to perceive vague impressions, feelings, and occasionally brief images . . . almost glimpses. \"What are these?\" I asked. \"A message,\" the hobo said. \"All this is a note . . . for you. Something that someone has long wanted to tell you, but didn't know if you were really there to tell it to, and didn't know if you would ever be ready to receive, or able to accept it. I'll leave you here now. Just watch, listen, and feel . . .\" The hobo vanished. But strangely, I didn't feel alone. \"Hello . . . ?\" another, different voice called out to me. With just that one word, this voice suddenly gave me the warmest, richest, and most moving sensations I had ever felt. That one word from this single voice echoed, resonated, and filled me melodiously, like nothing else ever had. \"Hello?\" the now clearly feminine voice repeated, seeming a little uncertain. \"Answer her,\" the hobo said, suddenly appearing next to me again. \"I thought you said you were leaving me alone here,\" I remarked to him. \"Just trying to help,\" he assured as he disappeared again. \"You're not there . . . not real . . . are you?\" the feminine voice now said. \"Yes,\" I finally answered, fearful that the voice would drift away — that I would lose her before I even knew who this sweet-sounding essence was. \"I'm here . . . and I'm real. Well, I come from a real and solid place . . . Indiana, anyway. I'm from Grand Rapids, Michigan originally though,\" I added, trying to sound as real and down-to-earth as possible. \"You're . . . real?\" the voice replied, its hope and warmth seeming to return, \" . . . really there?\" \"Yes,\" I replied, now feeling an increasingly strong desire to reassure, even comfort the voice, and the spirit. Whatever or whomever she was behind it. \"I'm really here. Can I see you?\" \"N-no . . . not yet,\" the voice hesitated amid the waves of light. \"Why not?\" I simply asked. \"Because you could not accept me before,\" the voice said, \" . . . accept or understand what I tried to convey to you as plain as day — not in words, but in every other way I could . . . smiles, looks, everything. But really, neither you, nor I, were truly ready for it. I'm not all that sure you could accept me and what I want to convey to you now, actually.\" \"How do you know?\" I said. \"Unless you show me?\" \"Let me show you . . . what I desire,\" the voice suggested. A tapestry of images, sounds, smells, and sensations — all the things I associated with Christmas — began to surround me. There were presents, both wrapped and opened, around a Christmas tree. But strangely, they seemed like just wispy shadows. What seemed the most solid and real of all though was the warm embrace I was suddenly feeling. It warmed me, even melted me, like nothing else ever had. I noticed a sprig of Mistletoe in front of me . . . or was it above me? Suddenly I felt a warm, passionate, incredibly loving kiss upon my lips. It was so wonderful. It brought tears to my eyes. \"Merry Christmas,\" the voice said, \" . . . my love.\" I opened my heart, fully now, to what I was experiencing. I returned the embrace that I was feeling tightly with my mind. I felt an arm wrapped around my neck and shoulder, clothed in the softest and warmest sweater I could ever imagine. I felt a warm, smooth cheek pressed against mine, and sensed that my nose was surrounded by some densely curly or wavy, but wonderful hair that had the sweetest scent about it. It all was like nothing I had ever felt before. It was something though I had long unknowingly, but instinctively wanted . . . even for Christmas . . . especially for Christmas. \"Would you like this?\" the voice asked, seeming to still embrace me, to embrace all that I was. \"Would you like this for Christmas? Always?\" I now couldn't stop the tears of joy beginning to flow from my eyes at all that I was feeling and experiencing. \"Yes,\" I said, embracing the voice . . . what or whomever she was . . . back with my entire being. \"I want this . . . for Christmas, and for always.\" \"Then wish it,\" the voice invited. \"Wish it with me for Christmas . . . please. I need you to.\" \"I wish,\" I said with my eyes closed tight as I relished the ethereal embrace I was sharing, \"that I have this . . . that I experience, know, share, and cherish this . . . for Christmas, and every other day, now and always. This is more real, more wonderful, than any other gift I have wished for, or could wish for Christmas . . . ever.\" \"Thank you. Thank you, my love,\" the voiced said, as I felt myself deeply kissed once more. I didn't want to let go of this feeling . . . let go of her now. I wanted to experience this, to experience her. To be with it, even a part of it, and of her, always. Then I heard a steam whistle off in the distance seemingly behind me. \"All aboaaaaard!\" I also heard the Conductor call in the distance. \"No. Not now!\" I said, still embracing the voice . . . the spirit . . . with all that I was. \"Don't you want to embrace me as more than just light and sensations?\" the voice asked. \"I don't want to lose you. To lose this,\" I replied, \"now that I've found you.\" \"I know,\" the voice empathized. \"I didn't when I was here, either.\" \"Was here?\" I asked with surprise. \"Remember, you came here alone this time,\" the voice reminded, \"and so did I . . . on a previous trip, as a grown-up. You and I can only feel each other here — across the gap that's between us. We can't be together fully here, as we are right now.\" \"All aboaaaaard!\" the Conductor called a second time. \"What do I do?\" I asked the voice urgently. \"Go, my love,\" the voice warmly encouraged. \"Go. Get back on that train. And then get ready . . . 'cause I'm gonna find you.\" \"How?\" I asked, still not wanting to let go of even her ethereal presence. \"No time now!\" the voice said urgently. \"You have to get back onboard that train before the Conductor yells 'All Aboard' again. Otherwise this, what we're experiencing now, is all we'll ever share. I want more. I want it all . . . with you. Please go, and trust that I will find you. Please . . .\" I cried openly as I gently started to let go of her essence that I was embracing. \"No,\" I said. \"I don't want to let go of this.\" \"What happened after Billy let go of his present, and allowed the elves to put it back in Mr. C's bag?\" the voice asked. \"Go, please . . . for me . . . for us. Now.\" \"I . . . I remember that,\" I said with a half smile as I took a sad breath, and let go of the voice, of her essence, fully. Suddenly, I found myself alongside the Polar Express again, with the Conductor right in front of me. \"Thought you might not show up. Almost thought you might stay,\" he said. \"Ticket, please.\" \"But I want to say goodbye,\" I replied sadly. \"Are you sure you really need to say goodbye? Or, should you be getting ready to say hello?\" he asked as he held out his hand for my ticket. I now smiled as I comprehended his meaning. I then reached into my shirt pocket, the one pocket on me closest to my heart, and produced the ticket again. The conductor once again took my ticket, hiding it behind his back as he punched it. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said as he produced it and handed it back to me. I looked at it . . . ACCEPT . . . the punch marks now read. \"I have an idea of what this might mean,\" I said to him. The Conductor now smiled and nodded approvingly as he gestured for me to reboard the train. I paused, looking around me . . . at the red bricked, festive, and brightly lit city that had appeared around me once more. \"Hurry sir,\" the Conductor urged. \"We still have to get you back, and then make our regular run. You wouldn't want all those young ones to be deprived of the experience you once had, would you?\" \"No. But I'm not seeing Santa, Mr. C, this time, am I?\" I sighed as I reluctantly stepped up the stairs of the train car. \"Who do you think made sure your someone's Christmas wish was conveyed to you? And yours back to her?\" a deep voice now asked behind me. I looked around to find the kindly Mr. C on the red brick plaza just outside the train's door where I was. I almost cried with joy when I saw him. \"I will always be real,\" Mr. C assured, \"as real as you'll let me be, inside your heart. But you're grown now, and I need your help, to make Christmas real for others — especially for a someone here on my list who has made a special request, a wish that only you can make come true. Not just for one moment, or one day a year . . . but for a lifetime.\" \"I will,\" I assured him as the train whistled and began to move, \"and not just for her . . . but with her. I promise.\" \"I know you will,\" Mr. C replied as he extended a hand into the stairwell of the car I was in. Grabbing a handrail with my left hand, I stepped down to the bottom of the stairwell and shook his hand as I tearfully nodded in acceptance of his commission to me. His handshake was firm, and real — as real as any hand I have ever clasped. That memory would stay with me always. I just knew it would. As the train started to pull away, my hand parted from Mr. C's, and we waived at, and almost saluted, each other. A magic, indefinable spirit of Christmas, had passed from him to me. I was one of Santa's helpers now . . . charged with helping Mr. C to spread the spirit of Christmas however I could. I wanted my own 'helper', too though. But now, I knew I would find her . . . or rather that she would find me. \"Atta boy!\" I suddenly found the hobo saying next to me as I finished climbing the stairs back into the train car. He even gave me a surprisingly firm slap on the back. \"Here, let's go back into your Parlor Car and celebrate your 'graduation' with some of the finest Irish Coffee you ever tasted!\" \"No,\" I gently countered. \"Let's go up to the roof, and sit around your campfire for a spell. And have the tap-dancing waiters deliver some good 'ol hot chocolate, right to us!\" \"See 'ya up there,\" he smiled as he vanished, while I proceeded to find the ladder leading up to the train's roof at the rear platform of the Parlor Car. — — — — — \"Here it all is,\" the hobo invited as I soon arrived up on the roof of the Parlor Car at the rear of the train. Not only did he have a healthy campfire going, but the tap-dancing waiters and chefs were all lined up behind him, with an entire urn of hot chocolate among them, and a steaming cup of it already on a saucer, resting on top of a sitting-box . . . all waiting for me. \"We just had to pull out the stops and celebrate in style, my friend,\" the hobo continued as I picked up the cup and saucer and sat down on the box. \"Consider this not just a graduation party, but maybe a bachelor party, too.\" \"Don't you think you're being a bit premature?\" I asked. \"After all, I haven't even really met this someone face-to-face yet.\" \"What do you think . . . really?\" he asked in reply. \"She allowed you to see into her heart — right into her heart! I should know. I was there with her on the other side of the light, when she left her message . . . several years ago now by your calendar. I even encouraged her some. Helped her to take a risk, seize the chance.\" \"Then thank you, my friend,\" I said as I extended my hand across his campfire. \"I, and she, owe you. More than we can ever say.\" \"Well, you're welcome,\" he accepted modestly as he shook my hand. \"Glad I could help. Glad 'ta do it.\" \"But would you mind telling me when she left her message?\" I then asked. \"By my calendar.\" \"That was the problem, as I recall,\" he replied. \"You couldn't take your nose out of your calendar. We even backed this rattler right up to the back of the Options Exchange tower at La Salle Street Station where you were workin' at the time. We sounded the whistle for 'ya a bunch of times to try and get your attention that Christmas Eve. But 'ya didn't come down out of that tower.\" I looked down as I remembered that Christmas Eve — how I had just lost the firm I was then with over $1.2 million on a stock index options trade, and was madly studying the charts and technical indicators on those options late into the night to figure out where I had gone wrong. I had even fallen asleep at my desk that night, and thought I'd heard this steam whistle, but dismissed it — figuring it was just a nearby factory or power plant I hadn't heard before. I was too stressed, too worried, too sad, even to look out a nearby window and see what was sounding those whistle blasts. I even remembered now hearing the train go . . . letting it go. I so wished now that I had not. \"She was already on the train?\" I asked. \"Practically cryin' in my arms,\" he replied. I briefly closed my eyes and cringed with sadness and guilt now. \"You convinced her to leave the message?\" I followed up. \"I convinced her to open the doorway between you two,\" he responded, \"and to say hello . . . to even take a risk at beginning to express the deep and long-held dream she had for you and her. Took both me and the Conductor, even the Engineer and Fireman, the whole trip up to convince her to even risk saying hello as she did. Teaching her how to really drive the hog helped brighten her spirits a fair amount, though. But after she got up the courage to say hello . . . you, and her, did the rest.\" I began to smile somewhat now. \"Is there anything about her? Anything else, I need to know?\" \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"After all, you're the one, besides her, who's most directly involved.\" \"No,\" I decided looking beyond the train as it proceeded south. \"I'm ready to meet her . . . out there, back in Chicago.\" \"She's been ready to meet you again, too . . . for some time now,\" the hobo replied. \"Had some rough spots in her life, she's had. She's tough, even a professional, now. She deserves a reward for all that though. Someone good.\" \"Like me?\" I asked. \"Like you, kid,\" the hobo agreed. \"Just like you. But drink up! We don't have much time. However, we got a whole lot 'a hot chocolate here to finish!\" I smiled now as I took a healthy swig of hot chocolate. \"I wish she was here . . . to share this train ride with me,\" I sighed afterward, looking into the hobo's campfire. \"Take her for a train ride, kid,\" the hobo encouraged. \"Take her for lots of train rides — especially on trains like this. Trust me, that'll make up for you missin' her rattler, and her missin' yours. Who knows, she might even wanna drive the hog. If so, let her!\" \"I will,\" I promised as I held up my cup in pledge, even as a waiter now refilled it. I will, I vowed to myself.[Chapter 4] \"Next stop, Chicago. Van Buren Street Station. Van Buren Street Station, next stop,\" the Conductor called on the public address system, even though I was the only passenger onboard. I sat in the Parlor Car one more time as the locomotive and cars of the Polar Express now rode familiar rails — from the south no less — into Chicago. Rails that I had traveled many times upon in my daily commutes from Indiana. I had never felt so refreshed and renewed from a train trip in my life though, as I was now. It had been better than even my first trip on this magic train. I was feeling wonderful as the train slowed to a stop at the Van Buren Street platforms, the wheels gently squealing as the brakes were applied a final time for me. \"Careful, watch your step,\" the Conductor warned as he opened the door and I stepped off the Polar Express back at the high-platformed station. Having lost my magic sleigh bell during my previous trip on this train, I double-checked one more time to make sure the doll was still in my left overcoat pocket, as I also made sure that my laptop bag was slung over my right shoulder. As soon as my first foot touched the platform though, it slid out from under me on a fine coating of ice and snow, and I fell flat on my back on the platform again. Things seemed to go dark once more as I heard the Conductor kneeling over me, calling, \"Sir . . . Sir . . .\" \"Sir . . . Sir . . .\" I now heard, with many more noises around me. I heard people talking, and even sensed a crowd around me. Someone was kneeling over me now, calling to me, \"Sir . . . Sir . . . are you alright? I'm a doctor,\" the voice said. All I could tell was that the person talking to me was female. I began to become aware of my body again — of the serious pain now in my head and back. I was aware that the wind hand been knocked out of me, and that I now had difficulty breathing. My arms were stretched out either side of me. I could still feel them as I lay prone on the platform. My left hand now felt something against it . . . what seemed like artificial hair, a small, plastic head, and the lacy frills of a small dress, even a veil. My left fingers could barely touch it. I suddenly became fearful that whatever it was, it might be knocked out of my grasp. \"Left . . . hand . . .\" I managed to murmur urgently, still just beginning to regain consciousness. \"Oh my God,\" I now heard the woman kneeling over me gasp. I sensed the object being lifted out of my left fingers. I turned my head slowly and opened my eyes, trying to focus on the object the woman was now holding and examining. \"It's the doll!\" the female doctor now said. \"The doll . . . that we saw . . . years ago . . .\" \"Do you . . . remember me?\" she now said to me as I tried to squint my eyes and focus on what seemed like her dark hair and tan face. I just moaned something and began slightly shaking my head. She then leaned down to me and whispered in my ear, \"Are you the boy I couldn't help staring at on the Polar Express? The one who found my ticket? The one I shared those adventures with?\" A shock of amazement ran right through me as I put two and two together — her words, with that voice, the sweet scent and feel of her hair, and the warmth and smoothness of her cheek as it brushed against mine. I tried again to look and focus on her, as she pulled her own head back slightly to look at me again. \"Yesss . . .\" I now whispered. \"Polar Express . . .\" \"Do you know how long I've been wondering just how real you and all that were?\" she quietly asked with something of a tearful smile now in her voice. \"Do you know how long I've wished that you were real? I . . . I gave up hope last Christmas. I even dreamed that I couldn't get on the Polar Express last time because I couldn't take it if you hadn't gotten on again . . .\" \"So it was you . . . we stopped to pick up . . . this trip. But you didn't get on,\" I whispered slowly, the memories of seeing the crying figure in the apartment from the train coming back now. She now looked at me strangely while still kneeling over me. \"That was Christmas Eve . . . last year,\" she said. \"I thought it was a dream that I allowed the Polar Express to pass me by . . .\" \"I was there . . . on that train,\" I whispered. \"It was real?\" she now whispered, almost crying. \"Yes,\" I assured, remembering her message and our encounter at the North Pole. \"It was real . . . and so am I.\" She allowed herself to cry for a moment in wonder as she gently held her gloved hands to her face, seeming to try to conceal her emotions while she still looked at me. \"Your message . . . the light . . . North Pole . . .\" I added in confirmation, now knowing whom I had found . . . or rather, who had found me. \"Make way! Make way! Paramedics!\" we both now heard two men announce nearby. \"Let's get you to a hospital,\" she gently said, taking a breath and trying to regain her composure as she now saw the paramedics approaching. \"I'm a doctor,\" she now told the paramedics, showing her hospital photo ID badge to them as they knelt down and began to check me out. \"He appears to have suffered a concussion on the rear of his head, and is exhibiting signs of moderate shock.\" She carefully ran her thinly-gloved hands under my shoulders and back from both sides, before adding, \"But otherwise there appear to be no major fractures in his shoulders, hips, or back. He appears stable enough for transport. I'll be going with this man to the hospital, though,\" she added, looking warmly at me. The paramedics then departed to fetch a stretcher for me. \"Here,\" I weakly said, feeling the doll lying once again by my left hand and picking it up. \"This is for you. Merry Christmas . . .\" She reverently took the doll, dirty and time worn as it was, and looked at it again. She then held it close to her as she looked at me with renewed tears in her eyes, before carefully tucking it inside her own overcoat. \"I'm not supposed to do this for a patient,\" she said, as she now gently cushioned my head with her gloved hand while the paramedics were still away. \"And I haven't ever done this on a first date. But,\" she said, still hardly able to believe what was happening, \"you got my message . . . my Polar Express wish.\" \"I did,\" I confirmed, \"and I wished it with you.\" I could now sense she wanted to hug me tightly with joy. But given my injuries on the platform, I could also sense the physician in her was keeping her from doing so. \"Well . . . Merry Christmas. And thank you, thank you so much,\" she whispered as tears fell from her eyes and she gently gave me an ever so soft, but soul-melting kiss. I could only look at her and smile after that kiss of hers. Seeing the paramedics return with a stretcher, she took a deep breath again, trying to resume her professional demeanor. \"Okay guys, let's lift him on three,\" the doctor now professionally instructed the two paramedics as she gently placed her hands underneath my head and one shoulder, \" . . . one . . . two . . . three.\" I felt myself being carefully lifted onto the wheeled stretcher. I was then conveyed up the stairs and out of the station to the waiting ambulance. \"You live in north Chicago,\" I whispered as we approached the ambulance. \"What were you doing here, at Van Buren Station? These trains don't serve your neighborhood.\" \"Now I know you were on that train outside my apartment!\" she said with another warm, tearful smile as she gently shook her head. \"But you know, tonight I felt led, inspired to take a walk before I went home. I was even about to take a ride on the South Shore, for the heck of it. It just felt like the right thing to do. That's when I found you, lying on the platform.\" \"Sorry you didn't get your train ride tonight,\" I hoarsely apologized. \"Maybe we can fix that,\" she suggested, \" . . . later.\" All during the ambulance ride to the hospital, and right through admission into the Emergency Room's Triage section, she never let go of my hand once, except to take the gloves off of hers. Some might say that we weren't really each other's type. There were times when I might have agreed with such an assessment. She later confessed to me that she had wondered about that, too, for a long time. But seeing her light brown hand intertwined with my fairer-skinned fingers in the ambulance . . . nothing had ever looked so right to me now.[Chapter 5] So she nursed me back to health at the hospital. Sure, she was a doctor in the hospital's pediatric ward . . . and I wasn't a kid. But she would visit and check on me every day, usually a couple times a day — even on her weekend off. On the day I was released from the hospital, I just couldn't find myself saying goodbye to her . . . and neither could she. \"Would you like to go for a train ride?\" I invited as we stood at the hospital's front door, both of us not quite knowing what to do next. She just hugged me. Luckily, she was able to take the day off, and so I treated her to a ride on the South Shore line that morning as our first date outside the hospital. I even pointed out my house in Beverly Shores as we went by it on the train. We went by my house because I had planned to take her to lunch in a classic café I knew of beside the line a little further east in Michigan City, Indiana, where we could continue watching the interurban trains go by, right down the middle of the street, just like we remembered the Polar Express doing. Having never been there before, she practically fell in love with the town and its classic brick buildings and tree-lined streets. Her falling in love with me I wasn't worried about right then. Over lunch however, I eventually confessed to her where I was in life at the moment, job and money-wise. I almost cringed as I told her, suddenly fearing it could cause her to lose interest in me — or at least put a damper on our day. \" . . . I just felt you should know this about me. Where I'm at right now,\" I said, concluding my confession as I looked down. \"I just care enough about you to want to be honest with you.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" she just responded with a smile, to my surprise. \"Give me that check, please.\" \"But . . .\" I replied, wanting to be a gentleman and pay for our lunch anyway. \"You don't want to screw up the wish now, do you?\" she simply replied. \"Our Polar Express wish?\" \"No . . .\" I said with a growing smile as I passed, more like surrendered, the check to her. I had a feeling she would come to use that question on me again in the future. Possibly a lot! \"If you don't mind my saying so, it seems to me you've just been in the wrong line of work,\" she then suggested, suddenly seeming to know and have a better perspective on me than I did! \"It has got you part of the way. But now, you just need to change tracks. Get on a different train in life. I'd like to help . . . if you'd let me. Don't worry, you can return the favor though. I'm not exactly liking hospital work myself.\" I just kissed her across the table, right there. \"Thank you . . .\" we both just said together, at the same time. \"What for?\" I then asked. \"What am I doing for you here?\" \"Just making my wish come true,\" she replied with a tear in her eye again. \"I'm sorry I missed your train years ago,\" I said, almost sighing with regret. \"I could have been making your wish come true a long time ago.\" \"And I'm so sorry I didn't take the 'second chance' train I was being given last Christmas,\" she replied, knowing what I was referring to. \"I've been haunted by that dream for a year now, and I've had to wait this whole extra year, too.\" She stopped and looked down. I could tell how she was now feeling over missing that run of the Polar Express. \"It's okay. It's all okay,\" I assured her as I held her hands across the table, trying to keep her from crying with regret. \"I am just so glad I listened to that idea inside me the other night to take that walk to Van Buren Street Station,\" she continued, trying to focus on the positive now. \"I just suddenly felt I needed to be by, or on, a train that night, right then.\" \"I'm glad you did, too,\" I said warmly, \" . . . and so's the back of my head!\" \"Could I tell you something crazy though?\" she then quietly asked as she leaned forward closer towards me. \"Something that just would seem to make no sense?\" \"Tell me,\" I invited with a smile. \"Right now, I'm feeling the way I felt when I only heard and felt you as light,\" she said, almost whispering across the table, \" . . . up north, at the North Pole, years ago.\" \"I'm feelin' just as wonderful,\" I assured. \"Thank you . . . for urging me to let go of you though, and get back on the Polar Express that night,\" she said. \"I like being here with you even better.\" \"Wait . . . I said that to you?\" I replied in surprise. \"I heard you say that to me, when I was up there Christmas Eve!\" She gave me a warm smile. \"Maybe we were both hearing it — standing together closer than we thought,\" she suggested. \"Good advice though, wasn't it? Glad we both took it. Maybe it's just part of the magic. But hey, since time seems to mean nothing there . . . let me just tell it to you right now. \"Go, my love,\" she then just up and said as she gently tightened her hold on my hands across the table, \"Go. Get back on that train. And then get ready . . . 'cause I'm gonna find you.\" There it suddenly was — that voice, and those words, together . . . right in front of me. \"Go, my special one . . .\" I echoed back to her as I looked into her eyes, without thinking of what I was now saying. \"Go. Get back on that train. And then find me. It will take a while. But don't stop searching. Just listen to your heart and mind, and do what feels right. That's how you will find me. You'll recognize me by my needing your help — and by something I'll have for you. I will make up for all the waiting, and the searching though. I will. I promise.\" \"What happened after Billy let go of his present,\" we both just added together, \"and allowed the elves to put it back in Mr. C's bag? Go, please . . . for me . . . for us. Now.\" We then could only stop and look at each other for a moment. There it was — that marvelous moment when we just knew . . . that it was right, and it was real, all real. The circle for us was now complete. Our final words and messages of encouragement to each other had been sent, right there in that café. \"I can't just sit across this table from you any longer,\" she tearfully whispered. \"Ready to enjoy some more magic?\" I then suggested as we both then got up, and she drew close to me. \"Let's go catch another train. I don't care where it's going.\" She smiled . . . just before she buried her face against my shoulder and cried . . . cried for joy as I held her tightly, just like we did together in the light. — — — — — We spent the rest of the afternoon riding the South Shore line that day, running all the way east to South Bend and back through the Indiana dunelands along Lake Michigan . . . both ways, and several times! We began making up for lost time, lost chances, lost Christmases . . . right there, on those trains we rode together. \"Would you mind if we did dinner, too?\" she asked as we finally made it back to Chicago that evening, sealing her invitation with a kiss as we sat together on a train as it approached the end of the line at Randolph Street Station. \"We're in your town now,\" I smiled. \"Lead the way.\" She proceeded to treat me to dinner that evening at a grand restaurant along the city's Magnificent Mile, as we talked more . . . a lot more. We capped the night with a chilly but wonderful moonlight walk and kiss on the Navy Pier along the Lake Michigan shore. Although I'd done a lot of sitting during the day, she insisted on hailing a taxi to get us the short distance to the pier, so that I wouldn't overdo it on my first day out of the hospital. \"Merry Christmas, my Polar Express guy,\" she said to me as we ended our kiss at the Navy Pier, even though it was now several days after December 25th. But it was just the fifth day of the Twelve Days of Christmas. \"Merry Christmas, my Polar Express . . . partner,\" I replied, openly hinting where I wanted to go with all this — knowing then that not only did I have a fellow appreciator of train travel in my arms, but a kindred, Christmas-loving spirit as well, even a Santa's helper of my very own. With yet another one of her tearfully grateful smiles, and even a soft \"yes\" from her — two of them, actually — she let me know she now had such a person in her life, too. \"Just to be sure,\" I cautioned, \"you don't think all this is too soon . . . too quick?\" \"What do you think?\" she asked me as we continued to hold each other, throwing it right back to me, almost the way the hobo would. \"I think we have us quite a Christmas to plan this coming year,\" I replied. \"Yeah . . .\" she agreed smiling, as she gave me another powerful, soul-melting kiss that I now knew so well. — — — — — By the next Christmas, we decided to run our own 'Polar Express' — renting a whole classic train complete with a 2-8-4 Berkshire steam locomotive, to get married on. During the reception afterwards, and after we had each changed out of our wedding clothes, I had even arranged for her to drive the locomotive for a while as a surprise. She is still fondly recalling that highlight of our wedding day. We ran the train on the South Shore line, right past my house . . . well, it's our house now. She's still a pediatrician, but now she runs her own clinic just two stops from our Beverly Shores home east along the South Shore line in her adopted and beloved Michigan City. And when she's not healing children, she's taking in and repairing toys at a toy rescue clinic she helped to establish in a vacant storefront right next to her clinic, inspired by the neglected toys both she and I had seen in the toys car of the Polar Express . . . as well as by the doll that had helped her to find and recognize me. That clinic now helps forgotten and neglected toys to 'recover' and find new homes, bringing joy to children who could really use some. The doll that helped us to recognize each other is bright and clean now herself, but never seems to stay in the same place in our home for long. So she's anything but just forgotten and neglected on a shelf. And my bell, it hangs from its small leather straps in an archway between our dining room and living room — there to be rung by either one of us whenever we want a lift, or some Christmas spirit at any time of year, or to let the other know through its sweet tones that we love each other. Passing trains sometimes manage to ring it as well! And me? Instead of trading commodities, I now help manage and run the railroad. And every year, I make sure that there is a 'Polar Express' that runs on my line at Christmastime — big steam locomotive and all. We sell tickets to anyone who wants to take part in the magic, as well as give away tickets to deserving children and their families, along with a fair number of the toys that my wife . . . well, both of us, really . . . rescue and heal at the toy clinic each year. I now even get to play the seemingly 'gruff' Conductor, but I make sure everyone has a good time. My wife and I also take turns driving the steam locomotive every once in a while — having each earned full engineer certifications, of course! It is now the thrill of a lifetime for both of us though, when I'm the Conductor and she's the Engineer of our 'Polar Express'. I love looking forward, waving my lantern, and seeing her look back from the cab with a knowing smile on her face, just before she pulls on the whistle cord. In all this, my wife and I fully realize that we're just helping Mr. C to do his job. That's what we're doing now — together, and with more shared fun and joy than either of us could have ever imagined . . . or wished for. On Christmas Eve though, I always see to it that space is left on the tracks, and that a running slot at a certain time is kept open in the railroad's official timetable. Even with our first child asleep, and another one now on the way, my wife and I are keeping our annual tradition together, watching out a trackside window of our home, right at five minutes before midnight . . . in case the real Polar Express shows up, even to pass by at speed. Actually, we just call it to us now — closing our eyes as we hold each other tightly, just as we did in the light . . . with the rich tapestry of our shared Christmas all around us. Together, we feel the train's thunder on the tracks outside our house, and hear its whistle cry out loudly into the night. We can't wait until it's time for our children to take a ride . . .

What will happen to me there? I couldn't see anything outside it's all black. I was sitting between two men in suit I affraid they could hurt me if i do something, so i decided to keep silent. \"Here, drink it\" one of the man said. I reject it because it was from vampire and you will never know what they put it inside. \"Don't dissobey me, human\" He grab my chin harshly and put the cup near my lips \"Drink it!\" The other man pull my hair and gaps leave out my mouth. The water in the cup flow into my mouth. \"That should be keep you until we arrived. Sleeptight, human\" I tried to keep my eyes open but i couldn't. Darkness took over. Nct's parent mansion : Taeil pov \"But mom, no matter how many times you made a vampire slave event. We will be not interest on anyone. It's been years, Mom\" I walked with my mom in the garden. \"Darling, you never know if someone actually catch your eyes. You guys have been feeding animal blood and ite not good for you all. You know don't you?\" \"Yes mom, but if no one catch our attention, this will be the last even okay mom?\" \"Yes, now tell your brother to prepare before midnight.\" Mom said and walk away from the garden. I sigh and mind link the other about the news Why must mom made that event Haechan whined in the ming link Because she care about us and this will be the last event, lets make her happy I said in the mind link. The other agree and i cut the mind link off. As i arrived at the mantion, the guard bow their head politely to me. I walk to the living room and saw the rest of my brother there. \"Oh, hyung you're back\" Mark said still keeping his eyes in the tv \"Hyung, must we go to that event?\" Yuta said lazily \"Umm, This is the last one. And let's make mom happy. And mom said be ready before midnight\" I said and take a sit beside Taeyong \"Mostly girl who attendthe event just want to be close and seduve us. I rather not to pick them\" Jaehyun said in disgusted. \"Just admit it you like when they scream your name right\" Doyoung said while the other laugh. \"Well alright, just be ready before midnight\" I throw my head back and close my eyes Eunbi pov I slowly open my eyes and look around i was in a room and there is a paper bag accros the room That must be the dress i was going to wear I slowly sit up and hugged my knee. What will happen if they picked me as their slave. My life will be in mess. The door flew open and the man earlier came in. \"Good, you're awake, now get up and change your clothes, you must be ready before midnight.\" The man said with a smirk. \"Listen you human, no one will help you here. If they didn't pick you to be rheir slave, i could keep you on my own\" He said and walked out while laughing. I quickly change my clothes and fixed my make up. I saw that its already 11: 45 . He must be back in a moment. Then the man come back \"Good you're ready, Now let's go\" He grabed my arm harshly and force me to go inside the car. \"Are you curious on what will happen? Well then let me tell you something. Your parent was my father slave. But sadly he died a yers ago. If he still alive, he might lock you in his room right now. I decided to sell you to other vampire. Because i think you're useless.\" He grabbed my chin and stroke my chin \"Plus, i will be extra rich if they take you\" \"What vampire slave do?\" I ask him with shaky voice. \"Vampire slave, they feed on their master, torture on them and you might get some pleasure honey\" He smirked as his finger touch my lips. \"And i was told you were a virgin\" My eyes widen \"Virgin human are the best to feed on\" He said and lower his head to my collarbone \"Sweet and fresh\" The ride were finally stop and he quickly fix himself. \"Hurry fix yourself we're here. Don't embarrassed me or else you will see your parent in a pool of blood\" He said and went out. I quickly fixed myself and follow him into the mansion. Taeyong pov \"It's time master\" said the head butler \"Thank Jace, we will out in a moment\" Taeil said. Jace bow his head respectfully and went out the room. \"Alright, let's go\" I said and all of us went out the room. We all went to the ballroom and saw that our mom and dad were already waiting for us. \"There they are, what made you took so long\" Mom said before standing from her chair \"Sorry mom\" Jaehyun said and gave her his charming smile. \"It's fine, sit down. The event will be starting\" Mom said and we all sit one our chair \"Hyung, will there be someone who able to catch our attention?\" I ask Taeil hyung who was sitting beside me \"I don't know either\" He said while fixing his suit. Our father stand up and gave a speech thanking people who already come. I didn't paying attention for what dad said. But we all talking about the slave that were infront of us. It seem that no one catched our attention. Or is it?[Chapter 3] Winwin pov Time has pass and no one catched our eyes. This is boring hyung. How many slave are left. I ask through the mind link I don't know. No one catch our attention yet. I looked at Doyoung as he playing his fork that are place neatly in the table. \"Next please\" Jace said as the guard open the door. I playing the napkin on the table . This is boring . \"Please introduce her\" Jace said politly. \"Her name is Lee Eunbi. She is 16 years old. She is a virgin and new in vampire world.\" I immediately stopped playing with the napkin and looked at the girl. Eunbi pov We were guide to the ballroom. I looked around and i could see people talking and the man in suit talking with each other and each of them have girl standing behind them. That must be the slave I thought. I looked at them and they seem to be exited rather than affraid. Aren't they affraid Alex told me to keep shut and don't talk to anyone in there. He is now talking to his friends. The door were finally open and i could saw a man and a woman with 10 hansome vampire sitting beside them. I saw some slave trying to keep their fangirl inside them. The time has pass and i feel like crying. Alex looked at me and said it was my turn. He asked me to follow him but my leg couldn't move, my palm become sweaty, my legs become weak and i feel like trowing up. Alex grab ny arm painfully and i whimper. Alex let go of my arm when we reach the front. From Alex conversation with his friend i get to know that they were the most vampire family in this vampire world and everyone fear and respect them. I didn't looked up because i'm affraid that i will be punish. The only thing i could hear is the speed beat of my heart. Mark pov I look at the slave that is infront us I could smell a strong feeling of fear and i feel pity for this slave. I tried to look at her face but she hide her face by looking down at the floor. Taeyong hyung, could you ask her to show her face? \"Could you ask her to show her face?\" Taeyong hyung ask the man. The nod politly to Taeyong hyung and i saw he grad her arm and i immediately feel the pain. The man whisper something in her ear and she slowly lift her face. The mind link went crazy. All they do was compliment how perfect is she. We decided to tell our parent about this. Taeyong hyung decided to talk to dad. Dad stand up from his chair and said \"Our son agree to take her as their new slave\" Eunbi pov I force to lift up my head. I glup and slowing lifting my head. The vampire all were looking at me and i felt unconfortable. I tried to sneek glance on each one of them. They're handsome, no wonder why all the girl went crazy over them. I sigh at my thought on them and i sure behind those looks they are heartless vanpire. I keep praying for them to not take me and i could start planning how i can escape from Alex. I am confident that they will not take a girl take me as their slave. But i was wrong their father stand up and said \"My sons agree to take her as their slave\" I couldn't think anything. I feel like the world crush down like i couldn't breathe. The music suddenly stop playing, people stop talking and everyone seems to be suprise. People starting to whisper. \"Are you sure young master?\" I look at the man that dress like a butler. Please change your mind . Tears suddenly flow and i don't bother to wipe it. \"Yes\" one of them said. \"Would you like to pick more slave, young master?\" The butler ask \"No\" I snap my head up and tears quickly flowing. \"No!\" Alex suddenly look at me and raise his voice \"Don't embarrassed me!\" Alex suddenly grab my hair and i painfully whimper. Before i could puss him, someone rush lift him by holding up his collar. \"Don't touch her\" Alex let go of my hair and before i could know, i fall into darkness. Yuta pov The owner raise his voice to her as he yell l at her to not embarrassed him. I feel sorry toward her. He then grab her hair and Taeyong rush over him ready to kill him. I could see the owner shaking in fear. I smirk Why don't we just kill him Jaehyun said in the link. Just kill him, how dare he touch what is already belong to u s. Before i could reply him, i look at the girl, she look pale and about to faint. I slow the time, i rush toward her and hold her before she could feel and turn the time back. \"Taeyong, you can let go now\" Our father said as he walk to Taeyong hyung. Taeyong hyung immediately let go the man and let him drop to the ground. I walk to the rest of them carrying the girl. Our father walk to the man and the man immediately stand up \"We will send you the money Mr.Alex, you can go now.\" Our father said, the man bow politely at dad and rush out the room. It such a waste, I could've kill him Taeyong said. and we all smirk at his word. \"Now go rest all of you. Go back and take care of her\" Mom said \"Ok, mom we will be going take care\" Taeyong said and we all went out the ballroom. Jungwoo pov I walk beside Yuta and look at our new slave. She was sleeping peacefully at Yuta arm. We all went inside the car. \"Do you think she will freak out when she awake?\" I ask Yuta \"I'm sure she will\" Yuta let her sleep on his lap. \"What's her name again?\" Johnny ask \"Lee Eunbi\" I said. \"She's still a virgin right? and fresh. I couldn-\" Mark hit Haechan head. \"Behave Haechan\" Mark said. \"What should we do when she wake up?\" Haechan said looking at Taeyong. \"I'm not sure, but may be we should introduce ourself?\" Taeyong reply with a sigh. \"Or maybe we could play with her?\" Doyoung said and smirk \"That will be fun\" Doyoung continew.

I sat up and walked to bathroom"},{"Movie":"Longest Yard","Title":"Unexpected","Author":"kykyxstandler","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9405610","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ch. 1: Prison Summer: I woke up on this fine sunny day to 'You A Mi Baby' by 'Vybz Kartel'. Argh, gotta get up. Today I'm leaving to go spend the summer with my grandfather that I just recently found out was alive. Apparently he's dying to see me and my little sister Lilly but since Lilly is working then doing some sort of humanitarian work this summer, it'll be just me, granddaddy and a bunch of guards and convicts. Oh joy! –not. When I first found out my grandpa was alive I thought it was great, until I learned he's a prison warden in Texas. Don't get me wrong, I like Texas but the prison thing is putting me off. Not a good first impression. With a sigh, I stood up and got dressed, I brushed my teeth and hair, applied some mascara to bring out my bright green eyes and some blush to not look too drab, and finished packing. Grabbing my suitcase I went upstairs. \"Hey.\" I said to my parents, sitting at the kitchen table sipping some coffee. \"Hi.\" Dad said. \"Morning. You ready to go?\" Mom said. I grabbed a banana for the road. \"Yep. Hey where's Lilly?\" I asked. \"She already left to work but she said to have fun and that she'll miss you.\" Mom replied. I rolled my eyes while my mom wasn't looking. She finished her coffee and we were off to the airport. oXoXoXo Once out of the Plane, I grabbed my suitcase and in the waiting area, there was a big cop dude ─that kind of looked like a giant 'Randy Orton'─ with a sign that read 'Kathy Hope' on it. I went to him and when he looked at me, he seemed surprised. \"Miss Hope?\" He questioned with a slight twang. \"Yeah. That's me.\" He gave me a once-over. \"Sorry, it's just I was expecting more of a little girl, not a beautiful young lady.\" He said slightly embarrassed. He quickly recovered his composure and offered me his hand to shake. \"My name's Mitchell Garner but you can call me Mitch, I'm a guard at Allanville's penitentiary.\" I shook it and then he grabbed my suitcase and motioned for me to follow him. We got out of the airport and oh gosh the heat it never was this hot in Montreal, I'm glad I wore my faded jean shorts and bustier top, I thought as we made our way to an old red pick-up truck in the parking of the airport. Hopping in I grabbed my aviator sunglasses from my carry-on and put them on as I sat in the passenger seat. 'Mitch' slipped behind the wheel and we were off towards my grandpa's prison. Yay –note the sarcasm. What am-I going to do there this summer? Lucky me I thought to pack some of my favorite books but I already read them all. Maybe they'll have a library, though if they do I doubt they'll what I like to read which is romance novels. 'Mitch' didn't talk much, actually not at all and when the scenery changed to big expanse of sand, I stated to zone out. \"Where here.\" 'Mitch said as we stopped behing a large gate where guards stood at the top with riffles. It was very intimidating. Why did I agree to this? The car went through and we then stepped out. All the inmates outside looked our way, some gave me catcalls, it was very… disturbing. 'Mitch' kindly took my suitcase and as we started to make our way to the office presumably, another guard came to greet me. He wore the same uniform as 'Mitch' but he was skinnier, still muscular but less hulky-like. \"Miss Hope?\" He asked as he took off his aviator sunglasses to look at me. He also gave me a once-over. \"My name's Captain William Knauer but you can call me Will.\" I gave him a tight lipped smile. This dude gives me the creeps, the way he keeps looking at me is like he's one of the inmates that haven't seen a woman in years. \"I was under the impression that we were to receive an eleven maybe twelve year old girl not a…?\" \"Twenty-one year old woman?\" \"Yes.\" I looked around, it appeared all the attention was on us, every inmates were looking our way trying to get closer, it all made me very uncomfortable. Captain Knauer seemed to take notice and yelled at them to get back to their activities or they would all get back to their cell. He then offered me his arm which I took reluctantly and we went inside the big brown building. 'Mitch' took off in another direction with my suitcase. \"Knauer talked all the way to my granddad's office about a future football game against the inmates and how he's a great player and blah blah blah. I tuned him out as I tried to memorized the way to get to the office. We passed an old secretary lady wearing loads of pink and then Knauer knocked on a door telling me to go in. Before going in I took off my sunglasses and hung then on my top. \"Kathy?\" An elderly man in a grey suit asked as he stood from his desk and went to greet me. \"Hey, grandpa.\" I said kinda awkwardly. What do you say to your grandpa that you never met, eh? \"Look at you, I thought you would be a little girl.\" \"Yeah, I got that a lot.\" He then gave me a quite awkward hug that I returned. Once we let go, we stared awkwardly at each other for a while, neither one of us knowing what to do. \"Well, you must be tired I'm going to let you go get settled in. A guard will come get you for dinner.\" He said at last. \"Ok.\" And with that, I got out of his office only to find captain annoying waiting for me outside. He seemed startle for a moment as he looked at my face. \"I'm here to get you safely to your room.\" Knauer said as he snapped out of his daze. He then led me to what will be my room for the next 2 months and a half, all the while chatting about football and his talents and again I tuned him out. I soon saw a sign that interested me, it read 'Library' as we walked through the many corridors. Yay, I'll have something to do. I quickly memorized the way there since that'll pretty much be the highlight of the summer and soon we got to my room. I went in, it was of decent size with pale yellow walls, a double bed with white sheets and an ensuite bathroom. My suitcase was by the bed. Unbeknownst to me Knauer had followed me in. \"I would recommend not leaving this room unless accompanied by me or another one of the guards.\" He nearly gave me a heart attack. \"Of course there are guards practically everywhere but just as a precaution.\" \"Ok.\" I said as I turned around to face him but what I thought was: yeah like that's gonna happen. Especially since all I want is to spend time with hot fictional heroes and I doubt there'll be a lot of inmates in the library and even if there is, I'm sure at least one guard will be there should I need help. I waited for captain creeps to leave but apparently he didn't seem to catch the drift or chose to ignore it as he leaned against the doorframe observing me. Guess the library will have to wait. I turned around and started unpacking my things, as I choose to ignore him. \"I'll come get you later.\" Knauer said before leaving me alone. I quickly finished unpacking deciding to go check out the library before dinner. Ignoring Knauer's warning completely. I retreated to where I remember was the library. Once I got there I was surprised by how big it was. Surely I'll find something to read there. Surprisingly there where kind of a lot of people there but what was even more surprising is that nobody seemed to notice me they were all watching a scene where 'Mitch' and other guards were talking to an inmate. I got closer to hear what they were saying. Yeah I'm nosy like that. \"…about a four-eyed nigger.\" Said one of the guards to the inmate. OMG he did not just say that. It's like calling a girl a bitch or a gay a fag, you can't say shit like that. Mitch laughed. What could this inmate possibly have done to deserve to be treated this way? The guard then leaned in and whispered: \"Does the N word offend you? Nigger?\" \"No, sir.\" The inmate said all polite as he turned around and went about placing some books on shelf. I inched closer and the guard that insulted the inmate pushed the pile of books that was on the table down. \"Oops, sorry about that.\" Yeah, right. \"You mind fetching these books for me, boy?\" The guard asked. The inmate turned around and since I was closer I could see him more clearly. He was taller than me but not by much, he wore the prison uniform buttoned all the way up and he wore a cap on his head. He had beautiful milk chocolate colored skin and his face was gorgeous. He smiled to the guard and I could see he had a gold tooth and a toothpick held between his luscious lips that he kept playing with. \"No, sir.\" He replied as he went to pick them up. \"Just pick them up put them on the table.\" The mean guard said. \"There you go.\" 'Mr. Hot stuff' said before turning around and going back to work. \"You forgot one.\" The mean guard said as he grabbed a book and purposefully dropped it. Gosh what a jerk. The hot inmate turned around but this time he wasn't smiling as he went to pick the book up. The other guard that was there bent down and said something to the inmate that I didn't catch. Getting up 'Hot stuff' smiled but I could see it was forced. \"Hit you, sir? Nah.\" He said smiling. \"Ya'll my friends.\" He said looking at all of them. The guards all appeared to be disappointed that he wasn't going to fight back and give them an excuse to hit him. \"Pick these up.\" The mean guard said at last and they went to depart the library. \"Mitch. What the hell was that about?\" I asked as he passed by me. He stopped as did the other guards. \"What are you doing here Kathy?\" \"Checking the library. Now answer me. What the fuck was that about?\" \"A lady shouldn't use that kind of language.\" Said Mr. mean guard. That made me laugh a small sarcastic laugh. \"Oh, that's rich, coming from the man who uses the N word.\" I looked at him pointedly and he shrivel under my icy glare before hastily leaving with the other guard leaving me with 'Mitch'. \"So…?\" \"He… Umm… I…\" I raised my brow at that waiting for him to finish a sentence. When he didn't I rolled my eyes. \"Seriously 'Mitch' he didn't do anything why were you guy picking on him?\" \"He had it coming…\" I cut him off. \"Yeah, sure… He was all yes sir and picked up your stuff and all without bitching while he was being insulted in the highest way possible. I believe that's bullying. Seriously are you guys retarded or what? You can't do that or use that kind of language it's distasteful and argh…\" I couldn't even form a proper sentence. 'Mitch' seemed shocked by my anger. I bet he didn't expect anyone to react like that toward him with the way he's built and all but I don't give a crap. \"Sorry.\" He muttered before leaving. I closed my eyes and breathed a couple of times to regain my composure. Once I opened them again I was surrounded by a group of black man including the 'hot inmate' and I realized that sending 'Mitch' away might have been a mistake since now I was surrounded by inmates who probably haven't seen a woman in ages. They all looked at me a moment like I was a piece of meat and they were starving men, which was freaking me out. \"Hey, thanks for standing up for me.\" Said 'Hot stuff' he was looking at me sexily but him I didn't mind. \"I'm Earl but everyone calls me Meggett. That's Deacon, Cheeseburger and Carter.\" He said introducing everyone. \"Nice to meet you all, I'm Kathy.\" I said but I was only looking at Meggett. He had such beautiful deep brown eyes that I felt a little captivated by them. I could still feel the others looking at me but my attention was strictly on Meggett. \"Now what is a fine lady like you doing here?\" Asked Cheeseburger. I tore my gaze from Meggett and looked at Cheeseburger. \"Looking for books.\" I answered cheekily. \"Well I'm visiting my…\" I was cut off by Captain annoying. \"Kathy! What are you doing here? Alone.\" I groaned which seemed to amused the little group around me. \"I was visiting the library.\" I answered as if that was obvious. \"But I told you not to leave your room alone.\" He said reproachfully. \"No. You 'advised' me to not leave my room unaccompanied that's different.\" He seemed angry at that. \"Well the warden sent me to get you for dinner. So if you would please follow me.\" I gave a small smile to my new 'friends' and followed Knauer but at the door I was stopped by a hand on my arm that sent a shock through it. I looked back and it was 'Meggett'. \"I hope I'll see yah around?\" He asked me looking all cute and kissable if you take out his toothpick. \"Yeah, I'll come back tomorrow.\" He gave me a bright smile which I returned before Captain Annoying called me and I had to go. He released me but I still felt his eyes on me as I left to join Knauer and so I swayed my hips a bit more and I heard a small 'damn' before I caught up to Knauer. Maybe coming here wasn't such a bad idea after all. ","Summary":" Ch. 1: Prison Summer: I woke up on this fine sunny day to 'You A Mi Baby' by 'Vybz Kartel'.

The movie and it's characters belong to their owners respectfully. This story was inspired by Carrie Underwood's song, \"See You Again\", I would suggest reading it while listening to the song. Kate McNealy looked over the picture of her fiancé one last time before she tucked it back in her breast pocket and stood up from her seat and walked to the plane exit. The last year-and- a half had been hard on the newly engaged couple; it was the first time she had been deployed since meeting him and for the first time she had someone other than her uncle Mitch to come home to. Now she had her birth father and her self-appointed 'uncles', Brian and his coworkers waiting for her, she had more care packages and letters than she knew what to do with. While away, her paternal grandmother and one of Brian's female co-workers had been invaluable in helping her plan the wedding while she was overseas. They helped Brian and her plan the venue; pick the dress and a million other details she didn't have a clue about. She finished her walk through the gates and made her way to baggage claim, collecting her duffle bag. As she started to the gates she saw the face she had been waiting for over a year to see, waiting at the gates for her. He was in his typical jeans and button-down and never looked so good. She started walking to him, then gradually faster till she was at a dead run and her duffle hit the ground with a thud and her arms and legs wrapped around him, laughing and kissing every inch of his face. He squeezed her to him before taking her lips with his, putting everything into that much awaited kiss. She was thrown back to all the memories they had made the year before. Their first meeting in town, dating and falling in love for the first time for her and finding out he was a guard for a well-known Texas prison. They broke away, breathing hard. Reluctantly she unwrapped herself from him, realizing the audience they had. She gave him a teary smile, \"I missed you.\" His thumb brushed a tear from her cheek, \"Ditto.\" She couldn't help the laugh that bursted from her and hugged him again, \"Oh God, how I've missed you!\" His tender expression morphed into a wicked one that sent a hot shiver threw her body, \"You can show me how much later. I know I plan to show you how much I've missed you. Repeatedly.\" They couldn't get home fast enough for her liking. She grabbed her duffle bag and they walked out of the gate, hand in hand, \"We might as well enjoy time alone while we can, because once Dad's released-it'll be a no-naked zone at my place and it's another six weeks till the wedding.\" Brian's grimace was enough to make her laugh, but she bit her lip to keep it in. While Brian and her dad would never be best friends-the prisoner and guard deal kept that from happening-they got along a lot better than when Brian and her first announced they were dating. Who knows the wedding might go off without them trying to kill each other! He swung her hand up, kissing the back of it, \"Remind me again why we're abstaining till after the ceremony?\" She gave a heavy sigh, \"Cause Grandma Patty said it was tradition, supposed to make it more special and blah, blah, blah.\" He gave a belly laugh at her annoyed expression, \"If you don't want to do it no more than I do, why we are?\" She gave him a smirk, \"Lynnette said she had a tradition of her own. She and her husband didn't want to want no more than we do, so a friend of hers gave her a special wedding gift that would make waiting worthwhile. She sent me a very interesting care package.\" Now he looked interested, \"What was it?\" She smiled wickedly at him, \" The Kama Sutra . She also threw in The Complete Guide to Tantra and something called Tickle His Pickle in case the Sutra was too tame.\" By the look on his face, he knew exactly what she was talking about. He shifted his feet and cleared his throat, \"You know, maybe waiting isn't that bad. I mean it's only six weeks, we can wait till then.\" She barely hid her smile before he looked over at her, \"Yes,\" she thought. \"I'm definitely sending Lynnette a thank-you card.\" They continued walking and talking as they left the airport waiting area, and continued to the lobby when she saw someone that made her pause. He was tall, with a clean-shaved head and from the back she saw he wore an old leather jacket and worn jeans. As he turned around she felt her breath catch in her throat. He had the muscular build of a football player or a wrestler and had the look of a man that had seen a lot in this world. His neat beard was more grey than it had been before. It was Brian's whispered, \"Surprise,\" in her ear that told her it wasn't a coincidence look-alike. He turned to face her fully and the big grin on his face said it all. For the second time that day she dropped her duffle and ran at the man full-out, \"Dad!\" and hugged him to her tight. Tears bright in her eyes as she hugged her father for the first time as a free man. Battle hugged his daughter tight to his chest, tears in his eyes as he looked to the sky and thanked whatever god was watching for bringing his daughter back home to him. Alittle background note here: Kate is Battle's daughter, she's the result of a one-night stand he had with her mother when they were teenagers. Her mother died when she was young and she was put into foster care; as soon as she aged out of the system she enlisted and had been on assignments nearly from the beginning since her basic training was completed. She was on leave for several months and finally had the chance to look into her birth records, that's when she found Battle. Battle had no idea a child came from that night. So to say he was shocked to find he had a grown daughter is an understatement! ","Summary":" I own nothing but Kate. The movie and it's characters belong to their owners respectfully.

Glancing leftnand right down the hallway, he realized that they were alone. Hensighed, wondering what he had done this time around.

Of course, hisnimmediate response was that they could do it on their own, but it wasnsomething more than pride. He had actually expected more from Crewe.n Secretly, that appreciation from before Crewe had been banned fromnthe league had been reignited. One didn't become the MVP withoutnhaving some fans and Knauer had been disappointed at first to saynthat he'd been one. Hencould appreciate how things had turned out for Crewe though even whennthe man couldn't. Knauer had been glad that he'd driven drunk. nOtherwise, he'd never have this opportunity. He didn't bothernhiding the fact that his gaze lingered at a few areas longer thannnecessary. Crewenwas surprised by how much that gaze actually unsettled him. It was anbit too… possessive. Eyes narrowing, he took a step back to putnsome distance between them. Afternthe game, he considered them to be on good terms. The captain nonlonger tried to beat him up whenever they were in the same room,nwhich was always a vast improvement in Crewe's opinion. However,nif he thought about it, he'd been seeing the man a lot morennowadays. He guessed that the warden had actually been doing a goodnjob running interference before. Ifnhe was honest with himself, Crewe would admit that he had a grudgingnrespect for Knauer. He might not be the dumb redneck he'd firstnthought him to be and after two games into the guard's footballnseason where Knauer had proved to be an efficient and intelligentnquarterback and coach, he almost wanted to congratulate the man fornwhat he was accomplishing. Almost. Asnit were, he was just wary, waiting to see what was going to happen. \"Unger'snin the infirmary,\" Knauer informed. \"Unger?\"n Crewe repeated smugly. That had definitely been very considerate ofnthe captain to arrange that meeting, allowing Unger some free time innthe yard while the entire Mean Machine team had been present. It hadntaken the guards quite some time to break up the fight, not tonmention the lag time between when the fight had started and when theyneven tried to stop them. Knauer even managed to blame the wholenbrawl on Unger himself. Crewendefinitely had a better opinion of the man. \"Thenpyro's alive,\" Knauer said with obvious distaste. Itnwas the moment that Knauer took that another step towards him, didnCrewe realize that the captain wasn't just stating that as fact fornthe sake of knowing. \"Whatnare you going to do to repay me?\" Knauer's smile set off warningnalarms in Crewe's head. \"Uh,\"nhe shrugged. \"I know a guy who can hook you up with somenMcDonald's.\" Knauernrolled his eyes, taking another step that took him in the realm ofnuncomfortably close. Crewe took a step back, looking past thencaptain hopes that someone else would soon show up. Nobody did. Hencould handle a fight or whatever punch the captain threw at him; henjust didn't think the other man wanted to fight. Pretendingnto be unaffected, Crewe joked, \"A thank you's not good enough?\" \"Well,\"nKnauer said, allowing the distance between them to remain for thentime being. He pretended to think about it, already knowing what henhad been going to ask of the man any way. He needed to keep an eyenon him. It wouldn't do if any of the inmates got any bright ideasnon what to do with the superstar while in the block. He didn'tncare if Crewe could take care of himself. Knauer wasn't going tontake any chances. \"How about you stay on the sidelines at practicenfor some consultation?\" Crewenlooked at him in disbelief. He wasn't sure he'd heard correctly.n \"You want my help?\" \"Arenyou going to start questioning me?\" Knauer retorted. \"Arenyou going to start hitting me?\" Crewe replied. He relaxed,nthinking that the captain had only wanted to ask for his help. Thencaptain smirked again. One thing Crewe had was balls, alwaysnunpredictable. Knauer liked unpredictable. \"Not yet.\" \"Okay,nthen,\" for Crewe it was a no brainer. He'd rediscovered his lovenfor football and anything was better than doing nothing. \"I'llnhelp.\" \"Good.\" Thinkingntheir conversation was over, Crewe tried to walk away. Knauernblocked his path. \"There'snone more thing.\" Thenfeeling of unease returned. Crewe asked, \"What?\" \"Younneed to repay me for something else.\" Runningnthrough all the favours he'd asked while at the prison, Crewencouldn't think of anything he'd asked the captain. \"I don'tnknow what you're talking about.\" \"Insaved your life.\" Knauer stated simply. He waited to see if Crewenwould deny it. Bitingnhis bottom lip, Crewe had rather forgotten about that. Seeing thatnthe captain was waiting for a response, he offered, \"The old mannsaid as much.\" \"And?\" \"Thanknyou?\" He knew that wouldn't be enough, but he could hope. Henhad nothing left to give except his expertise, but the captain hadnalready gotten that. How could he possibly repay him anyway. He'dnhave to save the man's life just to break even. \"Younknow that's not how we thank people in prison,\" Knauer said. Henlooked expectantly at him. \"I believe you took care of Lynette,nright? That was a very nice hat trick.\" Crewenwinced and covered his eyes with his hand. Would he never live thatndown? But then the implications of what the captain had just saidnsettled in. \"What?\" \"Threento five,\" Knauer said walking by him with a smirk. He grabbednCrewe's ass as he passed. \"I look forward to numerousnexpressions of gratitude.\" o.o.o.o Endnficlet A/N:nDon't forget to R/R (Read and Review)!

I don't own *insert fandom name from above*..."},{"Movie":"Longest Yard","Title":"Why Am I Here Again?","Author":"GracingOctober","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6227232","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Okay, so I've finally decided to redo a Longest Yard story, since I've found my love for the movie after watching five times in a row like I used to. :D I am listening to it now as I type. :3 Characters belong to the rightful owners and actors. I don't know if I'm going to make this an 'M' later on or not, but there's definitely going to be some language in here. I do not own The Longest Yard 2005 remake. That belongs to Peter Segal. :D ENJOY! :DD How did I let you talk me into this? The drive to her new job was, to say the least, boring. There was nothing to notice about the scenery besides the occasional bush or cactus. Maybe even cattle. But that was it. Ponytailed dark brown hair scratched slightly at the back of a young woman's pale neck, forcing said young woman into habit and used her bandaged right hand to slide it across her shoulder so it would rest against her collarbone. Rock music was blaring from the speakers at a comfortable volume, not to the point where she thought her ears would bleed and could feel her brain vibrate in rhythm to the bass. No, it was a comfortable volume, just loud enough for her to sing along with the songs she wanted to sing along with while barely hearing herself. A gray messenger bag sat in the front passenger seat, holding the essentials for her work and online college. The young woman's deep green eyes quickly tore from the road in front of her deep blue Toyota Camry that she had received as a –late- birthday present from her parents to her bag. It was decorated with dark gray and black slashes and symbols. She had ordered the bag when she was younger from her favorite site and paid for it herself. Well, as close as you can get when you pay your mother the money to buy it, as compensation. She knew what was inside. In the back part there was a cushioned pocket like area, where should would keep her binders and books when she was younger but now held a wide but thin Dell Inspiron laptop. It held many files and documents and, like her car, was a deep blue. It had a few stickers on the front, some with witty sayings and other with pictures or names of bands she liked. And there were a couple random ones, of course. The second area of the bag, the one closer up front and was the area where she held her papers that she deemed not important any longer when she was younger now held files and papers that were important. The zipper that was clearly visible on the flap of the bag that held a bananza of pencils and pens (and sometimes the occasional pack of fruity gum) when she was younger now held, well, more organized pencils and pens. She smiled at the thought. Some habits never die, since she knew there was a pack of Trident Layers in there. Her went back to the road where she knew she wasn't expecting anything. What could you hit out here? 'Worst case scenario, a small cactus. But oh oh! What's that? Another cactus! What a surprise!' She thought, rolling her eyes. The song that was previously on had faded out and a song she did know came on. It just so happened she was in the mood to sing along with this one. But of course, it wasn't a rock song this time, but it was just as good. It actually had a meaning. Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for? Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'her But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? \"Daddy look what I made\", Dad's gotta go catch a plane \"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?\" I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby... And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel my pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back... I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing \"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?\" Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, \"Daddy you're lying \"You always say that, you always say this is the last time \"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine\" She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it \"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!\" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, \"this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'\" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em They're saying \"You've got one more chance to do right\" - and it's tonight Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on And I'm singing... And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel my pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back... Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet I take a bow and thank you all for coming out They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing \"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,\" But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden? \"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' \"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad \"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad' \"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin \"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going\" But baby wait, \"it's too late Dad, you made the choice \"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us\" That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill Yeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain and scream \"die Shady\" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to say.. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel my pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back... Yes, this song showed that it had an intimate meaning. Her voice had risen whenever his had risen, and she spat out the words to the imaginary crowd whenever his did. And damn everyone to hell if they doubted that she loved this song. She loved songs that held a meaning, a purpose. The song switched to another one that she knew, coincidentally enough. And once again was Eminem. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down... Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it That was never my object for someone to get killed Why would I wanna destroy something I help build It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life Like fuck it i understand this is business And this shit just isn't none of my business But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it? It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willin' to be the bigger man If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers Eminem's \"Like Toy Soldiers\" faded out from the speakers. \"Stupid Girl\" by Cold came on. Sure, she liked this song as well, but turned down the offer of singing along simply for the fact that she could see a building coming into the distance. It was a towering building, of course. And she immediately knew what it was. Allenville State Male Prison. Her new \"Home\" and the hell-hole she was to study people for psychological research. Her laptop was her classroom for the online college she was going to. Of course, soon she would have to go to the building portion, but she had to do work here. As long as her brother Nathan was there to keep her company, she wouldn't really mind it much, she reminded herself. And Nathan better keep the dickwads at bay, both inmates and guards alike. She remembered some stories that he told her. A couple of years back, the Guards and Cons had a football match against eachother and the cons won by a touchdown, by infamous Paul Crewe himself. Of course, Nathan wasn't there at the time of the game, but had heard of it from the other guards and read about it. She drove up to the gates, 'Apparently the color blue isn't too uncommon here' she thought. All the better. She could hear the trunk which held her more personal things (clothes, toiletries, cards from friends, ect.) roll around with the turn she made to slide through the gates. A man in a uniform came up and signaled her to roll down her window. He had really light hair and a small moustache that was located maybe a little too close to his upper lip. He had a small smile on his face and his name tag read \"Englehart, David\". She rolled down the window. \"Good afternoon, ma'am. I take it you're Ms. Mercer? Our doctor?\" She smiled. \"Oh no, I'm not a doctor. I'm here for a job while I'm in college. Haven't graduated yet. But in a sense, yes. I'm your psychologist.\" He kept his smile, surprisingly maintaining excellent eye contact. \"Well, I take it you're Nathan's little sister?\" She nodded. \"You would be correct, sir.\" She actually liked this guy. He wasn't looking at her breasts. \"Well, Ms. Mercer, I'm going to have to instruct you to take keep moving forward and take the first right turn. That's where our employees park. Have a nice day!\" He instructed. She returned the farewell with a bright \"You too!\" and replayed the instructions in her mind. After taking the right, she saw the one person she was looking forward to seeing. Standing right in the middle of the parking lot. 'Like the dork he always was and always will be in my eyes.' She thought. There was her brother, Nathan, literally standing in the middle of the small parking lot, pointing enthusiastically to an empty parking space, his short brown hair only waving slightly in the wind. He had their father's eyes, which were a light but warm blue. She laughed to herself at his antics and pulled in smoothly.

But there was a definite airrnof sadness and longing to the kiss, and as the warden kissed hisrnex-prisoner, he fought back the lump of emotion that had gathered inrnhis throat.

I hope you enjoy. Just a warning- chapter two and the first half of chapter three will contain physical abuse, and the whole fic deals with triggers and unhealthy coping mechanisms (murder is in the title, after all...) so please be warned. The chapters will also get longer as the story progresses, but hopefully the trigger warnings will grow fewer. Hopefully. Oh, you'd better watch out, You'd better not cry, Better not pout, I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town! I tried to calm the panicked feelings clawing at my chest. The voice on the radio seemed so cheery; it made me sick. Ron, best friend extrordinairre, quickly leaned over the seat to flail at the radio switch until he brushed it off. He was always in tune with my triggers, but he never made a big deal about it, for which I was grateful. \"You could have asked me to turn off the radio, Ronnie,\" his mom said from the driver's seat. smiling at us in the rearview mirror. \"S'ok, mom, I didn't want to bother you,\" Ron said. Didn't want to embarrass me, more like, but he didn't say so. He waited until his mom was focused on the road again to hunker closer, whispering in my ear. \"He's not really in league with your Dad, you know. He can't be. Santa's all about joy and love and all that jazz.\" \"That's not even true,\" I snapped back, also keeping my voice low. \"He puts coal in the stockings of bad kids. That's in all the stories.\" \"That's just a scare tactic to get us to be good,\" Ron started, but then he realized what he was saying. \"Raich…\" \"I don't want to talk about it any more,\" I said, turning to look out the window. Beside me, Ron sighed. We rode in silence until Ron's mom turned down a familiar, dingy street. I took deep breaths, trying to stay calm as we pulled up in front of my house. \"Here we are!\" Ron's mom sounded too bright and cheerful compared to the dark weight in my gut. \"Thanks for the ride, Ma'am,\" I said, grabbing my backpack and jumping from the car as quickly as possible. \"Merry Christmas!\" she called. \"Yeah, goodbye.\" I closed the door and headed for the house. When I looked back, Ron was peering through the window, concern on his face. I went inside and closed the door softly. It didn't matter, though; Dad still heard me come in. \"Who was that?\" he demanded. He hated when I got a ride home from school - or anything else - because it brought people close to the house. To him. \"Just a friend from school,\" I said. \"Their mom didn't want me to walk home in this cold.\" I'd learned long ago to leave out any details about my friends, including gender, for fear that my dad would take exception to something. The way his brows knit told me he hadn't missed my vagueness, but he let it slide. \"How was your mother?\" he asked. It was always 'your mother,' as if he'd never met her. \"Fine,\" I said. \"She would've liked to see you, I think.\" Dad grunted, a 'drop it' sound. I went to the closet to take off my coat, mind shifting back to my afternoon visit. Mom was in a mental institution, and had been for three years. She'd been crazy before that, but it wasn't until she'd OD'd on heroin (again) that they finally committed her. Since then, I only got to visit her occasionally. That's where I'd gone off to today. What I didn't tell dad was that the visit had been pretty short - it was depressing when your own mother had a younger mental age then yourself - and I'd spent the rest of the afternoon in the woods with Ron, talking about anything but Christmas. \"You don't have plans for tonight, right?\" When I went into the kitchen, I noticed dad was making caramel popcorn - one of his favorite treats, which I despised; who ever thought sweet and salty together was a good idea? - and that there was egg nog on the counter. I liked egg nog the way Ron's mom made it, fresh on the stove with no liquor having ever come near it; hot, thick, sweet, and chunky with cooked egg before she strained it. Dad's store-bought junk would be filled with rum, whiskey, bourbon, or vodka, and as thin as skim milk. \"Nope.\" Last week, I'd been out every night. I'd told my dad I was at holiday parties, and I was, but what I didn't tell him was that I'd gone to a friends house for all eight nights of Hanukkah. Ron, sweetest of best friends, had come with me, even though he'd missed two or three Christmas parties because of it. I could never tell my dad, of course, that Christmas parties triggered me. Not when he was the reason for the triggers. \"Good,\" dad said. \"We can watch some christmas movies, spend some time together.\" I tried not to flinch away from his words. After all, the last time we'd 'spent time together,' I'd ended up covered in welts and bruises, losing far too much blood. I'd given up telling myself that 'maybe tonight would be different' long ago. It wasn't like I couldn't see him pour extra rum into his own glass of egg nog. It wasn't like anything had changed.[Chapter 2] Here's part 2. This is one of the two chapters that will have descriptions of abuse, so 1: trigger warning! and 2: I'm sorry if it's cringy. I don't have all that much experience with physical abuse (thankfully) so it was an imaginative experience. Also, big thank you to Hasty for following, favoriting, and reviewing! He's making a list, And checking it twice, Gonna find out who's naughty or nice, Santa Claus is coming to town! My dad was all about Christmas music. He played it constantly. Not the classy kind, though, but the annoying stuff they have on the soft-rock station all December long. His favorite was that song. He used it when he wanted to control me. It grated against my soul like a flint, threatening to burn me. I hated Christmas music for that reason. But I did love the Chipmunks. I listened and watched them religiously whenever I could. My dad hated them, so much he'd lose it if he heard their voices when he came in the door. That was probably why I loved them so much. At Christmas, though, we could compromise. I hated the Christmas songs, and he hated the Chipmunks, so I put on Christmas with the Chipmunks, and we were both miserable, but neither of us complained. It still felt like betrayal when I heard them singing that song, though. After a long evening of watching movies, finishing up the decorations, and watching my dad get more and more drunk, it was almost a relief when he snapped. Almost. He didn't like the way I'd hung a decoration, and I was stupid enough to push back. The blow landed on my shoulder, and I knew it would leave a bruise. Then, he sent me to my room to wait for more. That was when I put on the Chipmunks; an extra layer of protection. Getting ready for bed was like putting on armor. I had a soft, loose camisole that tucked securely into the tightly cinched drawstring of long, fuzzy pants. A long-sleeved, knee-length sleep shirt went over the top. Add thick, fluffy socks and a kerchief over my hair, and you might think I was preparing to sleep in a blizzard. Of course, the house was often frigid, since dad was on again off again remembering to pay for heat. But the real reason I wore all those layers was that somehow it made me feel safer. I knew, of course, that what he did was wrong. I wished he would stop. Stop the drinking, the marajuana he smoked on weekends, stop the little something stronger he did on special occasions. But he was also my father. He'd taken care of me ever since mom had gone to the hospital, and he'd kept us alive several times before that, too. Ron was the only other person who knew the truth, but we were both too afraid to tell an adult. After all, maybe they wouldn't believe us. And even if they did, would my dad hurt me more? Hurt someone else? Most of all, I still loved him in the end. I couldn't bring myself to hate him; so I hated Santa Claus instead.[Chapter 3] Part the third. It was originally only half a chapter, but I realized that it would be smarter to separate the events below from any other part of the story, so I apologize for the brevity. Again, descriptions of abuse below, but after this you can expect some breathing room and other plot building excitement. Big thank you to sarakateastr1994 for following and reviewing! He sees you when you're sleeping, He knows when you're awake, He knows if you've been bad or good, So be good for goodness sake! I heard dad singing the dreaded song long before I heard his footsteps outside my door. I hadn't been sleeping, exactly. I'd read a book cover to cover, and was laying, lost in thought. When dad came in, he was very high. I was guessing he'd been into whatever he bought for his Christmas treat. He had a belt in his hands, and was erratically fiddling with it. I tensed, knowing what was coming. \"You disobeyed, and you defied my wishes.\" dad said, words slurring. \"You talked back, you ignored me, and you know you're not supposed to have friends drive you all the way home. You need to be taught a lesson.\" The belt came up, and he ripped the covers from me, grabbing my arm roughly to turn me over. I tried not to squirm as the beating came, a frantic flurry of blows only a little muffled by the many thick layers I wore. I knew struggling would only make it worse, but it was hard to stay still, especially when he started shouting, telling me how worthless and ungrateful I was, after all he did to care for me. By the time he'd exhausted himself, I was beyond feeling. I numbly realized that he'd left the room after a few minutes, but didn't feel well enough to react, not even to reach for the first-aid kit hidden in my nightstand. I'd worry about it in the morning. I glanced at the clock: 10:37. I moaned internally, knowing in my heart that I couldn't let myself lie there all night, or I'd be too sore to move in the morning. I'd just close my eyes for a moment.[Chapter 4] Some plot! Some action! Who knew? If anyone is actually reading this, thank you for bearing with me through the hard parts at the beginning. There won't be abuse like that from here on out- at least not for a while. (And if there is anyone at all reading, maybe you'd be willing to let me know by dropping a review? even just one word...) Once a year in the middle of December Santa Claus comes around, With gifts and things all the kiddies he'll remember- Visit everyone in town. When my eyes snapped open again, it was with a jolt of adrenaline. I didn't know what had awakened me, but my hackles were up. A check of the clock told me it was 11:55. I moved carefully, pulling my knife from under my pillow in a small, fluid movement. Tucking the blade into my sleeve, I slid from the mattress, ignoring the stiff protests of my body, and crept toward the door. The house was quiet as I padded down the hall, and when I pressed my ear to my dad's door, I could hear his faint snoring. I continued, making my way to the front of the house, and peered out the window onto the dingy street. At first, everything seemed normal: quiet and still. Gradually, though, I became aware of a rumbling, vibrating sensation, that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere all at once. Then, a queer wind whipped up, and the faint layer of grey snow and dead leaves in the road kicked into a swirling frenzy. A golden light exploded into the center of the storm, and a deafening Tooot! sounded. In the cyclone of light and motion, I couldn't tell what I was seeing at first. Then, as it began to slow and things grew clearer, I refused to believe my eyes. A train, steaming and sparkling in it's own light, glided through the street. It slowed until it stopped, shuddering. I took in the beauty of it, my breath catching in awe, acceptance filling my stomach with a warm buzz of magic. Unable to resist the curious draw of the thing, I pulled on my snow boots, slipping my knife down into one before quietly unbolting the door. A man leaned from one of the cars, bellowing and waving a lantern. I squinted toward him, straining to hear his words amid the pervasive metallic groaning. \"All aboard? All aboard! \" I finally made out his words. Intrigued, I made my way toward him. He watched me come, gaze piercing. \"Well, are you coming?\" he asked. He was dressed as an old fashioned train conductor. \"Where?\" I wanted to say yes, take me away! but too many years of hard knocks had taught me to be wary. \"Why, to the North Pole, of course!\" The conductor's voice rose dramatically. \"This is the Polar Express!\" Reflexively, my eyes flicked to the engine, where sure enough the name was plated in golden letters. I hadn't taken the time to study the words before, and while that may have been an oversight on my part, there was no reason for him to make me feel stupid. I frowned. The man didn't miss a second of it. \"Don't you believe in Santa Claus?\" \"Of course I do,\" I snapped, all my hairs standing on end at the name. My fingers instinctively twitched toward the place where I'd hidden my knife. \"It says here,\" the conductor said, producing a clipboard with a small cluster of paper attached, \"that you've been avoiding Christmas parties all month, you hate Christmas music, and that you have been caught making rude faces at santa decorations on more than one occasion.\" My senses were on alert now. He had a file on me? I was being held accountable for avoiding my triggers? Waves of nauseating dread washed over me, and I fought to keep it off my face. \"It seems that this may be your critical year,\" he was saying. \"If I were you,\" he fixed me with a sharp look, \"I would get on board.\" I tried to think. If I ran, would he chase me? Would he hurt me? Or, worst of all, might he wake my father? I tamped down the rising panic in my chest, mind racing. Slowly, a plan began to form in my mind. \"This train really goes to the North Pole?\" I asked. \"Yes!\" he said, and I had to stifle a wince at his enthusiasm. \"And, when we get there, will we get to see Santa?\" \"Certainly.\" I inhaled. So they wanted me to take a train ride. So? Maybe I'd just do it. I'd play their little game; I'd go and see Santa. Hatred prickled inside of me when I thought the name, but I only let it fuel my determination as I breezed past the conductor and stepped onto the platform. The man watched me pass with a mixture of concern and thoughtfulness, which I ignored. Because when I got to the North Pole, I'd finally have a chance to show Santa what an evil person he was. I'd finally have a chance to get back at someone for all the abuse I'd endured over the years. I'd finally be free of my father's biggest manipulative tool. I was going to kill Santa Claus.[Chapter 5] Merry Christmas! Hope everyone had a wonderful, trigger-free holiday. Sorry to leave you so long without an update, but I hope this makes up for it - longest chapter yet! So boys and girls here's something to remember Fifty-two weeks of the year; If you're not good and if you're not tender, Santa's sure to hear. I made my way into the carriage, feeling the vibrations under my feet as the conductor hauled himself up behind me and waved his lantern toward the engine. My thoughts whirled as I struggled with the heavy doors. How had Santa known? Everyone said, of course, the he just knew, but how? Realistically, he had to have a source. Did my dad call him? Or was there some nefarious magic going on? My thoughts shattered when I saw a familiar head of black hair peeking over the back of one of the seats. \"Ron?\" I gasped in disbelief. My best friend spun, eyes finding me immediately. \"Rachel!\" He sprang up, but the conductor tisked. \"Everyone please take your seats,\" he scolded, offering me the seat beside my best friend with a hand flourish. I staggered into my seat as the train jolted violently forward, perching gingerly on the edge of the bench. I wanted to avoid leaning on as many of my bruises as possible. Ron was bounced into his own place by the motion, and he leaned toward me in concern. \"Are you ok? Why did you get on?\" I took a steadying breath. \"I'm going to stop it.\" \"Stop…\" His brows creased. \"Stop Santa's reign of terror,\" I said. \"I'm going to kill him.\" Ron went pale, but he didn't say anything. Instead, he let the acceleration of the train toss him against the back of the bench. After a moment, he whistled softly. \"Wow, Raich,\" he murmured. \"Well, why'd you get on?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\" \"But,\" I frowned and broke off. Why had it come for him? I already suspected it only came for problem children. How had Ron gotten involved? Ron let the silence draw out, then turned toward me with a sudden jerk. \"I don't know, Raich, but doesn't it seem a little improbable?\" \"What?\" I stared at my best friend blankly. \"Santa Claus, magical elves and reindeer, everything ,\" he said. \"How can it be real? I've been giving it a lot of thought. There's no way Santa can do everything they say. And beside all that, I can't believe that some magical, arguably immortal guy exists just to enable abusers and punish kids for messing up while rewarding those who learn to keep their mouths shut.\" I blinked. That was a lot to take in. Never once had I doubted the reality of Santa, despite the fact that it would have freed me from a lot of manipulation. As fast as it crossed my mind, I dismissed it. \"No,\" I said, shaking my head. And maybe it was because we were on a magical train, or because of the buzz of magic still inside me; probably, though, it was because I couldn't let go of the one thing I'd pinned all the blame and hatred on. Without Santa, I wouldn't be able to cope with the reality I was forced to live. Ron bit his lip, and seemed about to say more when the train banked sharply, slamming my back against the marginally soft cushions. I gasped in pain. Instantly, Ron was hovering, eyes full of worry. I met his gaze in spite of myself, and he saw everything. \"Not again,\" he whispered. He knew better than to try to touch me in comfort, so he just sank back into his seat, hands clenched. \"I wish there was something I could do,\" he fumed. \"I want to rip him apart for this.\" \"Ron,\" I sighed. I appreciated how much he cared for me, but I hated how it affected him. Just then, The door behind us slammed open. We whirled to see the conductor hauling a girl by the arm into the carriage. \"I said that was a restricted area,\" the man was saying. \"I should be able to go where I please!\" the girl shrilled, and I winced. \"You do not own this train,\" the conductor grated, losing patience. \"You will stay where your ticket allows you to stay.\" Ticket? \"Ticket?!\" the girl screeched, and Ron groaned, clapping a hand over one ear. The annoying passenger wrenched free of the conductor's grip and darted down the isle, finding a seat in front of us. Great. The conductor sighed, then pulled a hole punch from his pocket. \"Tickets, please,\" he called, and started down the isle. \"Can you believe that jerk?\" The girl turned around, hanging over the back of her bench to talk to us. \"How dare he lay a hand on me like that? And besides, I was just having a little look around. He didn't have to go berserk like that. I should be allowed to go wherever I please.\" Now, I knew firsthand the panic of having someone grab you against your will, but this girl had been asking for it. Between her annoying manner and the fact that she was trespassing, I would have lost my patience, too. \"Yeah,\" Ron drawled. \"It's almost like he thinks we're just passengers, who belong in the passenger car, and don't have the experience to cross moving cars safely alone.\" \"Yeah!\" The girl piped, then her eyes narrowed. \"Wait…\" \"Tickets, please.\" We were interrupted by the arrival of the conductor at our row. He chattered his hole punch impatiently. I glanced up nervously. \"But I don't have a ticket,\" I whispered, and Ron nodded to show that he had a similar problem. The conductor raised a single eyebrow, and in a world-weary tone said \"check your pocket.\" \"I haven't got a pocket,\" I began, but Ron was checking his. He gasped, and I looked over in time to see him pull a shimmering, golden ticket from his pajama pants pocket. The conductor snatched it and punched dramatically. Small gold circles rained down on us as he worked at some kind of pattern. Finally, he handed the ticket back, then speared me with his gaze. \"Check your boot,\" he said. My fingers twitched toward the knife hidden in my right boot before I could stop them. I froze, feeling the man's eyes heavily, then reached for my left boot instead. There, where I was sure there had been nothing before, a gilded rectangle awaited. The surface was smooth and I stared, rubbing my fingers along it. The conductor cleared his throat impatiently, and I straightened and handed over the ticket. He flourished unnecessarily as he marked it. When he returned it and turned to the bench across from us, Ron nudged me. \"Look at this, he whispered, holding out his ticket. The pattern I'd noticed the conductor making turned out to be letters, neatly punched. On Ron's ticket, the letters read C O. Curious, I looked down at my own. The effect of the holes in the shimmering gold made the litters look almost holographic as I read \"U R. What does that mean?\"[Chapter 6] I felt like the end of the last chapter was lame, but this is better. Hope you enjoy! What do you think their tickets say? Comment to see if you're right:) Thanks to Shian1998 for the lovely reviews and the favorite! He'll bounce and bump, he's so doggone plump, As he goes his merry way. He shouts and sings for the joy he brings- If you listen you'll hear him say \"Lights! Lights!\" a small boy cried on the other side of the car, cutting off whatever Ron had been about to say. Sure enough, we were passing through a neighborhood filled with christmas lights. We all flattened our faces against the glass, excited. Every house was bedazzled in some way, each more creative than the last. Some were nearly hidden in the sheer volume of their own decorations. With children running every-which-way to see the lights, the conductor was momentarily thwarted in his effort to punch all the tickets. When we had passed through the street, he tisked and shooed everyone back to their seats, pacing up and down the isle, then returned to his task. Heightened as my senses were, it didn't escape my notice that the annoying girl had managed to avoid the conductor's hole punch, but I didn't say anything. The train, having apparently passed the outskirts of civilization, was beginning to pick up speed. The conductor arrived at the far end of the car, wiped his forehead, holstered his hole punch, and picked up the mike for the P.A. attached near the door. \"Ladies and gentlemen, Is anyone in this car in need of refreshment?\" He waggled his eyebrows, and a chorus of \"Yes!\" and \"Yeah!\" greeted his question. \"I thought so,\" he said. He flung the door open to let in a veritable swarm of waiters and chefs. The waiters began to sing and dance, spinning every other bench to create restaurant booths, complete with tables that popped up between. The warm smell of gourmet cocoa filled the car. The conductor hacked and yowled into the P.A. mike, clearly enjoying himself. I took the mug placed in front of me and just snuggled it in my hands for a moment, enjoying the heat and scent. The moment I sipped, my aches began to subside. I drank the whole thing quickly in spite of myself, craving it's healing, and happily accepted seconds. I savored the rest then, wanting to just enjoy the feeling of bruises fading and welts shrinking. As quickly as they had come, the waiters vanished, resetting the benches and leaving no evidence that they had been there, save for a dozen full bellies and the sensation of being whole snaking through my bones. The conductor, too, left the carriage, and we were left entirely without adult supervision. \"Ah!\" the girl in front of us sighed. She flopped around to face us. \"That was decent enough cocoa, I suppose.\" I choked. \"Decent?\" I asked. \"You suppose?\" Between my dad's inability to hold down a decent job and his expensive addictions, we barely had money for essentials. I was lucky to get Swiss Miss on special occasions, never mind any kind of cocoa that didn't have a chemical aftertaste. If she was implying that she got better than this on a regular basis… \"I'm Kay, by the way,\" the girl said. \"Hey, want to see something cool?\" She pulled out her unpunched ticket and folded it until it resembled a butterfly. Then, she opened the window and held the creation up to the breeze. The wings flapped, and it was neat, but the train was going too fast, and the wind was too strong. \"I don't think that's a great idea,\" Ron said, beating me to the words, but it was too late. Kay lost her grip on the little butterfly, and it whisked out the window and away. My eyes widened in horror. Ron covered his mouth. Kay stared for a second, then flipped her hair. \"It doesn't matter,\" she scoffed, shutting the window. \"I can just get another.\" Well, the tickets had arrived magically in our pockets, but it seemed awfully presumptive to think it would happen twice. We waited in tense silence for a few minutes, and after a moment I could feel Ron's hand drift tentatively across the bench. I wished I could let him comfort me, but I wasn't ready for the contact. When the conductor came into the car again, we jumped. He was frowning at Kay, and when she turned, he said \"Young lady, I believe I have neglected to punch your ticket.\" Kay tossed her head. \"My ticket flew out the window,\" she announced. The conductor flushed. \"It what?\" \"I wanted to see it fly,\" she said cavalierly. \"But you'll just get me another.\" The conductor grew redder and redder. \"You lost your ticket?!\" he exploded, and my skin began to crawl, my muscles tightening reflexively. I grabbed suddenly for Ron's hand, where it was still waiting on the seat between us, and he squeezed gently. \"These tickets are irreplaceable!\" The man was bellowing, and Kay had risen, too, indignance all over her. \"That's ridiculous!\" she screamed. \"They're magic. They just appear. So make another one appear!\" \"That's not how the magic works,\" gasped the conductor. \"You're coming with me,\" he added suddenly, straightening. \"I refuse!\" Kay screeched. \"I deserve a new ticket. Now give me one!\" \"You deserve no such thing,\" the conductor snapped. \"You were given one ticket, and you lost it. Now come.\" He grabbed Kay's arm, like he had when he'd dragged her in to the carriage, but this time he was dragging her out. The back. Alone. My stomach clamped, and I nearly retched at the turn of events. I started to shake. \"What if he starts to hurt her,\" I whispered, because that was all I could force out. Immediately, Ron cupped my hand in both of his, trying to stop my trembling with the least contact possible. I kept feeling worse, though, unable to calm myself down. \"Window,\" I croaked, and Ron was up in an instant, yanking down the sash. I climbed up to throw my head out into the fresh, cold air, and something slapped into my face. I snatched it. There, in my hand, was Kay's ticket. I practically fell backwards into Ron. \"Ticket!\" I gasped, waving it. Ron jumped up into the isle, peering out the door, but the conductor was long gone. \"Sorry Raich,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait until the next time he comes around.\" But I couldn't wait. Kay may have been annoying, and asking for all kinds of trouble, but I couldn't let anyone else go through what I'd been enduring for the past three years. That was why I'd gotten on the train in the first place, after all. So I shook my head. \"No. I'm going after them,\" I insisted. I began to walk toward the back of the train. I'd just reached the door when I heard Ron sigh. \"I'm not going to let you go alone,\" he said. I turned. Ron was the best friend in all the world, but I didn't want to put him in danger. \"You don't have to.\" I tucked the ticket into my boot. \"No.\" Ron clenched his fists. \"I don't protect you as much as I want to. The least I can do is come with you now.\" My heart swelled in appreciation for my friend. I didn't deserve him, I thought. He certainly didn't deserve me. But I was glad to have him; so I smiled. He came over to me and took my hand, eyes serious. Strengthened, I opened the door, and we stepped out into the cold together. ","Summary":" Thank you for opening my story! I hope you enjoy. Just a warning- chapter two and the first half of"},{"Movie":"Vampire Clan","Title":"How to train Vampire Sisters","Author":"Bellaswangirl71","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8956467","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Discailmer I do not own anything but my pen name.

POV SAM había estado patrullando por todo el bosque y la reserva , estoy realmente cansado y aburrido de toda esta mierda y para rematar lea mi novia , no deja de estar quejándose de todo le molesta que no este con ella en cierto punto la entiendo la eh descuidado , eh descuidado nuestra relación pero su carácter y el mio es suficiente ... la quiero mucho no diré que la amo porque mentiría jamas me eh enamorado y no se si lo haga o exista alguna mujer en este planeta que pueda soportar mi carácter ni siquiera yo puedo con el los muchachos creen que el siguiente en transformare es jacob , no me sorprendería si para el final de este mes suceda su transformación. se que billy espera eso , a pesar de que es un buen padre sabe que si el se vuelve el alpha tendrá un lugar estable en donde vivir y podrá cuidar apropiadamente de la tribu , pero también sabe que seria condenarse a si mismo a no poder salir jamas de esta tribu ser un guardia es lo mas agotador y estresante que puede a ver , si ser guardián es estresante ser alpha le cagaría por completo la vida. llegue a mi casa que es algo pequeña una pequeña sala , una cocina comedor y tres habitaciones y un baño , me quite la ropa y la deje por hay tirada me metí a la regadera le abrí por completo al agua fría, OOOH que sensación a pesar de lo fría me relajaba por completo los músculos en tensión me dolía la espalda y las piernas . termine de hace-arme me seque, el cabello un poco con la toalla y me puse algo que estaba por hay en el armario jamas eh sido bueno con esto de la ropa pero AGH al demonio cojo lo primero que encuentro. no necesito una chaqueta o algo parecido no puedo enfermarme tan fácilmente ...camine hasta la donde iba a ser la fogata tampoco es como si me fuera a cansar es algo lejos pero bueno . llegue hasta donde estaban todos pude oír a billy terminar de contar la leyenda de las tres esposas , no le puse mucha atención ya la eh oído tantas veces que me la se de memoria embry empezó a contar una de sus historias de dudosa procedencia. salude a billy intercambie unas cuantas palabras sobre la manada y jacob , cosas como que estaba preocupado porque lo había visto mas inquieto que de costumbre, tal vez su transformación iba a ser mas pronta de lo que pensaba, me despedí de billy y empece a saludar a todos con un cabeceo no tenia muchas ganas de hablar con nadie. todo estaba bien hasta que la vi...de repente todo ya no importo, no me importo, la manada, la tribu , jacob , ser alpha, leah todo dejo de importar sentí como si algo dentro de mi se comprimiera rompiera y como resultado revelara algo mucho mas cálido sentía como si algo llenara un vació que no sabia que existiera hasta ahora y entonces lo entendí yo lo entendí...me había imprimado en isabella swam... mire su rostro pálida como un chupa sangre , labios rojos como cerezas nariz pequeña y respingada cabello largo castaño rojizo con suaves rizos. todo en ella me gritaba , mi lobo me rasguñaba deseoso de salir para aparearse con su compañera. tuve que hacer una gran fuerza de voluntad para que mi prominente erección no se notara , estaba muy excitado la sola idea de tenerla bajo nosotros, si nosotros el lobo no hacia mas que darme ideas e imágenes de como seria poseería, hasta estas alturas me la imaginaba arrodillada frente a mi usando esa linda boquina para... bueno ok esto se esta saliendo de control sam contrólate fraccione un poco mis brazos y manos para darme algo de cordura. y con pasos decididos decidí sentarme al lado izquierdo de ella jacob estaba al otro lado me miraba confundido , aparentemente me había quedado mirandola mas de lo debido aparentemente los únicos que notaron esto fue billy, jacob , isabella y embry quien me hacia señas con su rostro tratando de preguntarme que paso, le hice una seña de después te digo. para romper el hielo salude a jacob y luego a ... isabella su nombre en mis labios era demasiado tenia que hacer algo o me la cojeria enfrente de todos, algo que al lobo no le gusto ni ami haciendo que me tensara. respire un poco y me calme. -hola jacob -hola sam. -quien es ella, \"si lo se, se estarán preguntando porque pregunto eso , si ya se quien es puues...seria muy sospechoso que alguien que jamas a hablado con ella o siquiera visto directamente le empiece r a hablarle como si la conociera de hace siglos...\" -oh ella es..be... -esta bien ajcob yo me presentare si? -esta bien. -me llamo bella un gusto...ahm. -sam ...sam uley. dije mientras alzaba mi mano para que ella la estrechara si lo se un poco desesperado por su contacto. -jacob oigo que grita billy quien lo llama para no se que lo único que me importa en estos momentos es sentir su piel y cuando por fin estrecho mi mano sentí un escalofrió muy placentero recorrerme la espina dorsal haciendo que mi ami guito pegara un tirón en mis pantalones. aparentemente ella también sintio la electricidad porque su espalda pego un pequeño tirón haciendo que me fijara mas en su cuerpo, mala idea mirar muy mala , parezco una carpa. -ujum (me aclare la garganta) tu eres hija del jefe swam verdad. -si , asi es. -que te hizo venir aquí ?

-si... es decir tu n... no nos conocemos , por dios nos acabamos de conocer y ya nos besamos tu por dios pensaras que soy una fácil. sam ante la afirmación de bella no pudo evitar enojarse y tomándola de la cintura y con voz de alfa enronquecida por la presencia del lobo dijo. -no te atrevas a volver a llamarte asi , tu no eres una facil , eres hermosa, por lo que veo timida pero con un carácter fuerte , decidida y me gustas , oh no sabes como me gustas, dijo mientras la volvía a besar con desesperación. bella estaba muy sorprendida por la declaración de sam pero lo unifico que le importaba era sam , sus besos, sus fuertes manos apretándola contra el , sentir su abdomen marcado y su prominente erección que hacia presión en su abdomen la enloqueció... y por dios que ya no había vuelta atrás ninguno de los dos lo sabia pero desde ese beso , desde esa mirada .sus destinos quedaron sellados.

Her mom was making hot chocolate, her step-dad was choosing a film and Ally was cuddling up on the sofa with the family dog, Sunny. As her mother, Linda, brought the cups of cocoa in, her step-dad, Mike, stood up, making her mom spill the drinks all down the front of his shirt. Ally resisted giggles as her mom apologised profusely to her husband, but no-one else was in the mood for laughing. Mike clenched his teeth and yelled at his wife, angry for making him burn. Linda cowered away as he raised his fist, the thing she had become accustomed to shortly after their marriage. This time, he lowered it and pulled something out of the back of his trousers and Ally screamed for her mom's safety. It was a gun. For Ally, everything went slower as he pulled the trigger. Her dog's barks seemed more distant, her mom's screams seemed to drone on for ever and it was only when Mike turned to her, a scary glint in his eyes, that she truly worried for her safety. That was how she ended up on this bus, in the dusty capital of nowhere. Well, Texas, but still it seemed like nowhere. In court, Mike had blamed her for everything and even though her prints weren't on the gun, his lawyer made a pretty god description of how she had forced him to shot her mom. She didn't even get a chance to defend herself before she was whisked on a bus, no clue to where she was headed. Now before I continue, let me tell you a little bit about Ally. She's approximately 5'2 with nicely tanned Californian skin, medium length gold-brown hair and deep chocolate eyes. She loved music and to sing and read, but her passion was truly dancing. Being so petite, she was quite a skilled dancer, but she could dance as street as the next person if the need was to ever arise. She was often described as gentle and caring but fiercely loyal and protective to those that deserved it. She wore little reading glasses for small print and had tattoos of a guitar on the inside of her wrist, a daisy chain round her left ankle and small, angel winds on each side of her back, white with red tips. Her minds were wandering as they pulled up to a prison, past two electric fences, and she was sharply pulled out of her seat by one of the two male guards on the bus. He pushed her ahead and she walked down a couple of steps before jumping gracefully on to the dusty floor. As her eyes adjusted to the harsh glare from the sun, another man approached, looking her up and down like a piece of meat. \"Well, well, well. Ain't she a pretty little thing?\" The voice was strong and smooth with a heavy accent. The man himself was 5'8, at a guess, reddish-brown hair, slimmer than the others but with a more fierce, dangerous look upon his face. Back home he would have been exactly her type, but she wasnt back at home, and there was no way she would be accepted if she got with a gaurd. \"I got her from here boys\" He grabbed her arm roughly and pushed her ahead, just like the other guard did. As she walked through the next gates, she noticed male convicts everywhere, playing basketball and lounging about on benches. Her eyes searched for females but only found the convicts that were males but dressed and acted like females. They waved at her. Amusedly, she raised an eyebrow and gave them a small smile. She was led to the warden's office, where the old man explained that she was the only female in the prison. Great.[Chapter 2] Hey guys thanks for waiting so patiently...two years :/...sorry bout that. I kinda didnt have the film and got stuck as to what to write, however, my mum got my the Longest Yard for Christmas and alas the story will live on Mucho Love xx Two guards – the one that had said she was pretty and a tall, muscular blonde – escorted her into where the prisoner's personal cells were. \"Wow, first girl inmate I've ever seen here\" The blonde smiled goofily at her and Ally gave a slightly awkward smile back. The other guard scoffed; \"Jesus H, Englehart – she's still an inmate\" \"Sorry Cap'n\" The captain pushed me slightly as I tried to slow down. I was nervous; I could hear inmates. \"Just walk\" They opened the little gate thing and people stared as I was taken to a cell. \"Warden had it adjusted so as to cater to your delicate feminine sensibilities\" I raised an eyebrow as I walked into a room – my toilet was behind a wall and there was a room partition between the door and my bed. It was a bit better than everyone else's. \"Thank him for me won't ya\" Captain gave a smirk; \"Yes, ma'am\" Englehart gave me a small smile and wave before the two of them walked off and allowed me to settle into my room. My first drawer was filled with underwear – although the bras were mainly sports and didn't have any metal under-wiring. There was also a drawer with a pair of full jeans, jean shorts, and three pairs of track suit bottoms. In another drawer were tank tops – black, white and grey and blue shirts. I changed out of the white jumpsuit behind the toilet wall and into a pair of track suit bottoms and a white tank top before retying the laces to the boots I was wearing. I put my hair in a ponytail before pulling on a cap so my face wouldn't burn – I may be tan but that doesn't mean I won't burn from the hot Texan sun. I took a deep breath before walking out of the little cell and into the big bad world of prison. Just as I did, a bell sounded. A guy passed as I stared up in confusion and whispered to me, helpfully; \"Lunch-time\" I gave him a small smile; \"So what's some delicious white chocolate such as yourself doing in an all male prison?\" \"What's a tiny little black guy like you doing in a prison like Allenvale?\" \"Touché…I'm Caretaker\" \"I'm Ally\" We smiled at each other and walked down to the canteen. Everyone went quiet when I walked through the door. \"Don't let them know you're scared, they can smell fear. You're the first ever girl here so as far as they know you're a mass murderer\" He pushed my back in a way that made me stand tall; \"Now look fierce\" I shot him a confused look before making my way over to the food line. I fetched my food and turned around, making everyone start back into chatter. \"Come on Al, you can sit with me\" I gave Caretaker a smile and he led me over to what I assumed was his normal seat.

And because I am in love with Willaim Fichtner. AND because I love this movie. I don't know if this will turn out to be a Knauer/OC pairing, but hey, I guess we'll find out, huh? Feed back is loved. Happy New Year's, here is a present. Before we get on to my story, I supppose I should tell you my name. My parents (who happened to be the peace and free love hippies that never really left the sixties) christened me Blue Rose, and let me tell you, that is possibly the worst name you could give to a child, it ranks right up there with the people who try to name their babies Satan or Hitler. It makes sure that no one wants to known someone with a ridiculous name, and leaves you feeling unwanted, which, incidentally, begins my story. Not being wanted gives you a bad feeling in your stomach, and a nasty taste in your mouth that is comparable only to the taste of blood. But nothing compares to the feeling you get when you're told that no prison wants you around. Well, the ones in New England didn't, anyway. They were either too full, or thought I was too dangerous. So, here I am, on the bumpiest bus ride ever, headed towards a prison in the middle of some thirsty desert. I could taste the dust in the back of my throat, and honestly wouldn't be surprised if I started coughing up little clouds of it. My only company on this little trip happens to be guards from the prison, and they seem too busy talking about football to care about me. What I care about, however, happens to be the collection of rifles they all have, and how many rounds each one holds. I'm a gun nut, you see, one of the reasons I'm in this little troublesome situation, and what was really bugging me was that I couldn't for the life of me remember what that particular model of rifle was called. I was so deep in thought I didn't notice when we arrived at our destination until I was roughly pulled into a standing position by one of my escorts. \"Come on, princess, time to join the party.\" I remained silent as I shuffled down the stairs, attempting to keep my balance as my wrists and ankles were hooked together by a long thick chain that also went around my waist. I vaguely remembered that it was called a T-chain or something like that. I hopped off the last step, not trusting myself to making the long distance because I didn't want to drop on my face. Great first impression that would be. The man that greeted my little posse and I was a tall, ranger looking type with dark sunglasses, and he even had a cowboy hat to top it off. Being in Texas was starting to make me miss people that weren't dumb rednecks, even if the people up north were fairly ignorant too. The man placed his hands on his hips before saying in a (surprise, surprise)southern drawl, \"Thank you Sergeant, I'll take her from here. Aftenoon, Ms. Rose. Warden would like to see you. Come on.\" He started walking towards the giant, castle-like fortress called Allenville Penitentiary, place many called home. A rough shove caused me to almost fall forward, but I managed to catch myself, and started to follow the Cowboy, soon walking in front of him, that ugly blue bus following slowly behind me, along with my entourage. The Yard was just as dusty and parched as the world outside Allenville, and I let my eyes run over the layout of the place. Guards in tall towers surrounded the prison, and each man had the same model of rifle, the one I was currently struggling to recall. The men all stopped their various activities and turned to stare, eyes wide as dinnerplates, and I felt all the dirty looks I was recieving, but I was a pro at ignoring people. I've had years of practice, unfortunately. Was it a Ruger Mini 14? No, it wasn't proportioned right...Definitely wasn't a Remington 870 either. Finally it came to me! Howa Axiom .308 Winchester bolt action precision rifle. Gotcha. It took me a second to realise that the bigger of my two escorts and I were alone, and that made me feel rather nervous. He removed his sunglasses and I noted the color of his eyes, which were brown and flat like a cows, and he gave me a nasty smile as he looked me up and down with a lecherous gleam not unlike the ones the inmates had been giving me. \"You don't look as threatenin' as every one's been sayin'.\"He was right, I suppose. I was about 5'6 and running miles early in the morning and late at night kept me slender. I had skin that held a year round tan, and I almost never burned, even without sunscreen, and just a few hours in the sun turned me golden. I held his gaze with my own unique stare, my right eye being green and my other blue. I had a mouth my mother declared as pretty (I made Deliverance jokes whenever she said that) and it seemed to be made for smiling. Too bad I never smiled that much. My light brown hair could've been beautiful, but I detested it long, and a prison barber hacked it off before I was sent here so it was screwy looking and sticking up, like I had stuck my finger in a light socket, except for the shaggy bangs that slightly obscured my eyes. \"I'm sorry to disappoint, sir.\" I said in my heavy New York accent, and made to move forward, towards what I hoped to be the Warden's office, when his nightstick came up and into my stomach with almost super human speed. I moaned loudly and dropped to the ground hard, unabled to catch myself as my hands were still chained. I panted and tried to roll the pain into a miniscule ball I could deal with, but to do that I'd have to have air in my lungs. \"Yeah, you don't look threatenin' at all, little lady.\" \"Guard Thomas!\" A slightly familiar voice came from down the hall, and I recognized it as belonging to the Cowboy guard, and Guard Thomas quickly pulled me off the ground. \"Wasn't very nice.\" I whispered painfully as Cowboy came walking towards us. \"What happened here, Thomas?\" \"She fell, Captain.\" Cowboy looked at me, then back to the guard before taking off his sunglasses and revealing eyes as bright and as blue as a gas flame that were alive with, dare I say, intelligence. I was always a sucker for blue-eyed boys. \"This true, Ms. Rose?\" I gave a glance towards my attacker and nodded briefly, which caused Thomas to smile rather nastily in my opinion. My rescuer shook his head and also gave a little half-smile before suddenly getting real close to the other man's face. \"Remember that I am the one running this prison, Thomas. I will not deal with men like that on my team. We clear?\" \"Crystal.\" Cowboy took me away and down the hallway I had been intending to go down, and knocked on a door, sparing a glance towards me before he opened the door. \"Ah, my newest addition. Blue Rose, am I correct?\" The Warden, an old man who looked like a drawing of Ichabod Crane come to life, came up to me and shook my hand, confusing me. What, did he want to be all buddy-buddy with me? An old, fat looking version of Colonel Sanders resided at the smaller of the two desks in the room, and was fanning himself in the disgustingly hot room. I almost started laughing as \"I say, Mr. Beauregarde.\" popped into my head, but mercifully I kept a straight face. \"This is Harold Dandredge, but political adviser. I'm running for govenor, you see.\" \"I suppose I should congratulate you, sir.\" The skinny old man chuckled at my words and waved his hand as if to dismiss my comment. \"They see the way I run this prison, and think maybe I should run this state. Now there are two things we take very seriously here in the state of Texas., and they are prison and football. We play a little of the latter here.\" \"The Warden is too modest to admit that his team is rather good, Ms. Rose.\" The Colonel stated, and it rubbed me the wrong way that all of these people were addressing me as if we had met at a gathering. Ms. Rose this and Ms. Rose that. \"But not good enough.\" the old man said firmly. \"Five years since our last championship. Five years. But that's not why you're here. You're here because I would like to make an offer to you. I would like for you to help my guards while they're practicing out there on the field, give them towels and drinks. I feel that you would be safer there, Ms. Rose, and it would allow the guards to keep quite a close eye on you. What do you say?\" I hesitated, choosing my words carefully. \"Well sir, I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid not.\" He turned instantly cold and got very close to me \"Now, I can assure you that your time here will be a whole lot easier if you just agree.\" I shook my head a little. \"I'm sorry, Warden, but my answer is no.\" The Ichabod Crane look-a-like shot a look at Cowboy, and turned away. \"If you'll excuse us, Ms. Rose. Captain Knauer you can stay.\" It took me a second to realise that's what Cowboy was called. I exited, and sat gingerly on the leather couch next to the secretary's desk as the door to the Warden's office closed. The lady behind the desk shot me a smile, and I heard brief shouts coming from the door I had just left, and I bit the inside of my cheek in slight worry. The Cowboy, whose name was apparently Captain Knauer, exited the office. \"Come on, Ms. Rose, time to show you your new home.\" \"Yes, sir.\" I murmured, wondering just how pissed off I had made the Warden, and just how screwed I really was.

Review and so on and so on and so forth. Reviewing encourages me to upload faster. Let the record show that I really don't like being stared at. Unfortunately, being a member of the female sex, it happens from time to time. I'll let you decide how uncomfortable and twitchy I felt in the lunchrooom of the prison, with all those peering eyes trying to undress me through the plain white shirt and blue prison pants I had donned before Captain Knauer had dropped me off here. I moved through the line to get...well I wouldn't really call it food, but I suppose it might be considered edible in extreme circumstances. I scanned the room after the substance had been scooped on to my tray, and took in the large metal walkway above the room, and my eyes lingered on the guns the two men possesed as they slowly patrolled back and forth over the prisoners. I forced my eyes away and looked for an open seat, my heart sinking slightly when I saw nothing but a bunch of hungry stares, and they weren't thinking about food . A whistle snapped my head to the right, but it wasn't a catcall, more like a \"Yo! Look over here!\" kind of thing. A skinny brown guy with astonishing white teeth waved me over, and I gratefully walked in his direction. I dropped my tray down across from him and he favored me with smile I didn't return. \"Girl, I don't think I've seen someone walk in prison before and cause everyone to drop whatever shit they're doing. Then again, a female has never graced our midst before.\" He held out his hand and I shook it. \"Name's Caretaker, and whatever you need, I can aquire it. Weed, meth, Prozac, and I can even get you McDonalds .\" \"What? No way. For real?\" I asked, my eyebrows raised. \"Yeah I got a guy, name's Cheesebruger Eddie.\" He pointed to a large black man with no hair handing some ugly, very obese man a packaged burger. I suppressed a smile, and poked my steaming food with a scrunched up nose. If it smelled as bad as it looked, I would have opted out of a tray. \"Name's Blue Rose. And I might be taking you up on that last one.\" Caretaker looked a little incredulous. \"Yeah, I have a stupid name, and my parents dropped too much acid. Or they thought a plant made my mother pregnant and were just guessing at the father.\" I offered, and blew air upward towards my choppy bangs, but they just fell back into my eyes like always. The thin man laughed as I looked around the room again. \"What can you do for me about the company of a cute guy?\" \"Well you'll have to lower your standards...a lot , but you could have your pick of any guy in here, girl, except for those distinguished ladies over there.\" I followed his gaze to a group of...well, I didn't know what those guys were, but they had cut their clothes to resemble a female's (they were wearing make-up too), and the mixed gathering waved emphatically at me. I slowly waved, a little taken aback. \"I think I'll pass on having them for my chick friends. I might consider hanging with a serial killer to be better company. And I don't think any guy could have me, Caretaker. I have a feeling our big strong guard friends might consider themselves too high and mighty for me. See you later.\" I left him with a grin on his face, and started walking to dump my tray, when I saw a big dude plant himself in front of me. I turned around and two more of his buddies were already there, each one of them as burly as the first, with sick smiles on their ugly faces. It looked like my odds weren't really that good, and I had a feeling they weren't going to get better. \"May I help you, gentlemen?\" I asked in my deep accent, my mind whirling though all the possible moves I could make, and all the moves these guys could stop me from making. All went tense as the inmates watched the little group, but they didn't stop talking, probably to not alert the guards that something was going down. \"Yeah, little girl, I think you can.\" The first man I had encountered replied, my back still to him as I eyed his companions warily. I stiffened as I felt a large hand trail lazily up the back of my right thigh, and it traced slow circles as it reached my hip. In an instant, I had tossed my tray of hot food all over him, and I felt the vibrations go up my arms as I hit him upside the head with the piece of thick blue plastic. He went down with an audible thump on the hard floor, and that's when things went crazy. His lackeys attempted to grab me, but the entire room had erupted into mass chaos. Everyone started fighting someone else, whether or not they even knew of each other's existence before five seconds ago. I felt my head rock back painfully, and something trickle out of my mouth. I recovered and, straightening up, I laid eyes on one of the lackeys who had my blood on his left fist, and a smirk on his face. I took advantage of the giant fight that I had started, and used it to get up close to the gigantic man, and I landed a kick straight to his knee. I heard a sickening crunch as my shoe connected hard . When he bent forward with a shout, I took his big bald head, and I slammed it into my own knee. \" HORNET'S NEST! \" I heard someone next to me call, and I felt myself get dragged to the ground by none other than my new friend, Caretaker. A deafening explosion echoed through the room, and I felt something sting my face right across my cheekbone. \"Second nest in two weeks, and the second fight in two weeks. Damn girl, you're just as bad as Crewe! You white people sure know how to stir it up.\" I snorted, and wiped the blood from my mouth, noticing that another thin stream was trailing down my face from the new graze under my left eye. \" STAY DOWN!\" I recognized the voice as one of the guards who had brought me here, but the sound of approaching feet interested me more. \"Come on, Inmate, on your feet.\" I felt a hand grab my upper arm and haul me into a standing position, and my eyes found the brown bovine gaze of Guard Thomas, my bestest friend in the world. \"What the hell did you think you were doing?\" \"Making some new friends, sir.\" I explained, standing tall and refusing to back down under his hateful look. \"You may be a female, Inmate Rose, but you're no different than any other piece of worthless ass that walks into this shithole.\" \"Oh, but I think I'm marginally prettier than those boys, sir.\" I gave him a look of wide-eyed innocence, and I heard the laughs and snickers of the grounded men behind me. Guard Thomas' slap yanked my head to the right, and I spat blood on the floor before turning to face him again. \"You know, I'm getting real tired of that, boss. It's not polite to hit a girl. Just think what your mother would say.\" He rose his arm to hit me again, but I caught his hand, my eyes hard. \"You're going down, Rose .\" He said, his teeth clenched, and he tore his arm out of my grasp before sneering at me. \"You get a turn in the hotbox.\" \"Oh, joy.\" X X X X Oh no. I lost count of how long I had been in here, but it seemed like an eternity. I lost count of how many times I thanked God I wasn't claustrophobic, but it seemed like a lot. I lay on the floor of the hotbox, my white shirt off to reveal the white exercise bra that they had given me. (Thank God it was one of the sweat wicking ones.) Apparently underwires can be made into weapons. Go figure. I knew I must be dehydrated, but I didn't really care. What bothered me was the lack of sound my companion in the box next to mine was making. Either he died, passed out, or didn't like talking to me. I was hoping for the second one, because he sounded like a nice fellow. I heard the sound of an approaching car, and I slowly scooted over to one of the metal holes in the tiny space, and peeked through. I watched one of the guards drag my companion out into the sunshine, where I was able to see he was unconscious. I owe myself twenty bucks. I thought, then jumped when I heard a loud banging on the door to my own box. \"You had enough, Rose?\" A remarkably bland looking man demanded, and I wiped my hand across my still healing mouth, and it came away damp with sweat. \"How long have I been in here?\" It must've been a month at least. \"Two days. Ready to join the boys in the general population?\" Are you mentally challenged? OF COURSE! GET ME OUT OF HERE! \"Yes sir.\" He unlocked the door and I stepped out into the light shakily, hoping that my legs would support me for a while. The man glanced at the white shirt in my hand, and his eyes were drawn to the long, red scar that marked me from the middle of my left ribcage, across my stomach, and ended at the top of my right hip bone. Seventy two stiches had been required to keep my insides in . \"Why is your shirt off, Inmate?\" \"It was rather hot, sir.\" I responded, wiping my face with the shirt. \"Wouldn't you prefer your shirt to be on?\" \"Not at the moment, sir.\" He gave my scar one last glance, and then dragged me into the blissfully cold car. Jesus, when I got out of this place I was moving to Antarctica, and I was going to roll in the snow NAKED. The drive back to the cell block was silent except for the whir of the air conditioner, and the purr of a beautiful piece of automobile. I was pulled out of the car and escorted across the giant desert of The Yard, around the large football game that was going on where I spotted Caretaker, and I threw a quick wave his direction. He raised his hand in acknowledgement, but looked surprised at the twisted scar I showed with indifference. Or maybe he was just surprised I was shirtless, I didn't know either way. Wonder if who's coaching the team . Anyway, I was dragged along towards a part of the prison I hadn't been in yet, and I felt my stomach drop a little as I saw my destination. The showers. A place of... discomfort, in polite words. I thought of American History X , and internally grimaced at the thought. Amazingly, they were all empty, which led me to assume everyone else was either in the cell block, or chilling outside. The bland guard gave me a change of clothes and some shower stuff, and gruffly informed me that he was keeping watch so no one would bust in and \"hurt a pretty thing like yourself\". I would serously be worried for the guy that came in, not because of the guard, though, because of what I might do. I stripped, and stepped under the metal fixture, turning the knob to as hot as I could stand it. I gave a sigh of pleasure as the searing hot liquid pounded down on me, and the room quickly filled with steam. I scrubbed my skin until I was satisfied that it was no longer grimy, and I washed my hair three times to clean it sufficently. I toweled off and pulled on the clothes that had been left for me, before knocking at the door to let the man know I was done, and the door opened. I walked through it quickly, my mind and hands preoccupied with trying to smooth down my hair (a futile gesture), when I crashed into a tall, solid mass. I sprawled onto the ground and winced as I hit tailbone first. I looked up to see who I had run into, only to discover I had run into someone I didn't want to at all. \"Oh-I-I'm-\" I stammered as I tried to crawl to my feet, only to fall a second time... And be caught by Captain Knauer. ","Summary":" A/N:Like I said, here is Longest Yard fic, just because I can.

Jean Lorrah of Empire Books published it in 1991 as the centerpiece of her magazine 'Sardonac'. The title comes from the National Emergency Alert System then in effect, something neither the show's Producers nor I ever expected one day to become outdated. They postulated that sound was very significant to the Tenctonese nervous systems, and that specific chord had a particular and memorable effect upon the Newcomers, so I guess we owe the change to the Tenctonese. If you don't remember the series or want a refresher, all 22 episodes and numerous made-for-TV movies are available for viewing and download at OVGuide dot Com / TV / Alien_Nation As this is the 20th anniversary of the series and my particular contribution to it, I decided to pull this story out of my files, dust it off and present it in an updated form. Enjoy. F Sharp Above High C by JMK758 Chapter One Seacret The night is still, the kind of Summer night when the air envelopes the unfortunate with stifling heat and the silence of the streets belie the inner certainty that absolutely anything could happen. However, it's a sensation that can't be denied. Walking the streets of Los Angeles on such a night is to know the oppressive solitude possible only in such a sweltering city of ten million, where none who can avoid it venture out of their air-conditioned apartments. Those who do stray into the open do so as briefly as possible. Ellen Pu and her sister Jackie walk the deserted streets on their way home from Ellen's job at Metropolitan Hospital. They don't feel the heat as oppressively as human women would, for the Tenctonese, bred for generations to adapt within years rather than lifetimes to wide varieties of environments, have been steadily growing acclimated to their new home on Earth. The denizens of the planet Tencton, whose spaceship Gruza crashed six years ago in the Mojave desert, are humanoid save for having distinctive bald and spotted heads with patterns inherited along matriarchal lines. There are other distinguishing features, tonight only their heads mark the sisters as Newcomers. Unfortunately, their social adaptability and acceptance over the past 6 years doesn't match their physical capacities. x Ellen considers herself lucky. Trained as a Medical Officer, she'd been trained in human physiology to supplement her Tenctonese skills and has adopted a position in the Pediatrics Ward of Metropolitan Hospital. While Child Care hadn't been her first choice, it was an inevitable result of her initial quarantine and processing through Immigration and she finds it rewarding. She rather likes taking care of both Human and Tenctonese, or 'Newcomer' children. Jackie, an aspiring model, found it harder to deal with Human lifestyles and prejudices. While the field of Fashion Modeling is not tight for Newcomers, few of whom found an interest in the field, there were many times when distinctions between the species are very firmly drawn. Very few Houses produce cross-species fashions, and Agencies therefore hire Humans or Tenctonese, but very rarely both. \"If things don't get better, I'm going to have a hard time making my share of the rent.\" Ellen nods noncommittally; it's the same familiar story over the last 5 of 9 months and she already knows where this is going. The money does come, the balance made about every five weeks, so three months ago she just wrote off a payment and restarted the 'clock'. She'll soon have to do it again. But this time the familiar story is sharply sliced by shattering glass from a window high above and several buildings ahead. A piercing shriek leads the falling body that tumbles amidst the shower of glass, the scream abruptly silenced as the body slams into the concrete with a sickening crunch. The tinkling of late arriving glass seemed to go on like a macabre echo. Both women had been transfixed in horror, but when the body hit the cement Ellen broke out of her paralysis and ran ahead, followed much more reluctantly by Jackie. Lights are already coming on throughout the street. The windows, whose glass kept cool air trapped behind them, open wide, but several close again almost immediately. One look at the nude body at the curb, however, is enough to tell Ellen that help is useless; the Tenctonese woman's body lies contorted upon the ground, pink blood welling up about the fractured hairless skull. Jackie averts her eyes but Ellen, to whom death is no stranger, is unable to look away. Already a crowd forms from the building beside them and along the street. Not surprisingly, the attitudes she can read in the eyes of the approaching people vary according to their species. xxx The sun that assaults the city with its merciless rays promises clear skies and sweltering heat, even more so than yesterday, and nothing is done for race relations for people to realize that a significant percentage of the population feels the oppression less than those whose ancestors had thousands of years to adapt to their native world's challenges. The damage to Earth's ozone layer, caused by universally but too late banned chlorofluorocarbon products such as Freon, has resulted in steadily rising temperatures throughout the globe, something to which Newcomers have greater adaptability, having been introduced initially to a 'globally warmed' Earth. The activity in the Detective Bureau Squad Room of this LAPD Precinct is at times so feverish, with multitudes of people arriving and departing, that cooling the room is usually an exercise in futility. The Department has budgeted two air-conditioning units for the huge chamber and they're hopelessly overwhelmed, as well as being perennially 'too far away'. Proximity to one of them is a choice and well-envied position, though the advantage tends to be mostly psychological. Detective Sergeant Matthew Sikes, whose position is neither choice nor enviable, sits sweltering at his desk opposite his partner at his facing desk. He wears 'cool' slacks and a many-years-old 'Simpsons' tee shirt, yet only the cooling fan of the computer to his right provides imagined relief. It is countered, however, by his partner's habitually natty insistence upon showing up for work in white shirt, sports jacket and tie. \"How can you do that?\" \"Do what?\" George Francisco, who'd originally been designated by Immigration Officials 'Samuel', asks, feeling quite undisturbed by either the room's heat or his partner's. \"Wear that outfit - and sit here looking cool as a cucumber on a day when we'll be lucky if it drops to 85 by midnight?\" He slaps his computer. \"We're gonna have a hell of a lot of down time today.\" \"I do notice that the colorfulness of your speech does change with your comfort, but ignoring the fact that we Tenctonese adapt well to your world, it having a very small range of climates, there is a certain image for the Department to maintain.\" x There are days Matt simply wants to rip the Potniki spots off his partner's bald pate. \"George, look around you. We're all cops here and you're the only one in a tie. Not one other guy–\" At that moment Captain Bryon Grazer, elegantly arrayed in a blue, three piece suit, steps out of his glass enclosed, air-conditioned office at the left wall. A blast of frigid air comes out with him, only to be beaten into submission by the large room. \"Sikes, Francisco, I've got one for you. Nice suit, Francisco.\" \"Thank you, Captain.\" Sikes' soto vocé contribution contains words George, for all his studies, had never before encountered, but though Grazer can't hear his words he can see his expression. \"It's a shame you feel that way, Sikes, but it turns out I can give you a break and let you cool off some.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yes. Go down to the Morgue.\" Sikes resists the temptation to tell the Captain to get his own dates. He knows how far he can push, but since Grazer doesn't seem inclined to go far from his door, it means the team must come to him, something Sikes doesn't object too strenuously to – for the seconds during which he can enjoy the draft. \"A Newcomer named Victoria Seacret went out her window last night, thirteen stories. Question is, was it suicide? Her human roommate doesn't seem to think so. Find out. I figured it's perfect for you, Sikes, seeing how you know the neighborhood.\" He hands him the report sheet. \"Geez.\" It's less than a quarter mile from his home. He half-glares at the Captain but decides to hold his tongue; Grazer knows the rules, and if he decides to ignore them there's little Sikes can do about it. What he seemed to be saying was 'you're the resident Newcomer / Human expert, so it's your baby.' \"I have a unit picking up the roommate; she'll meet you at the apartment building.\" Grateful for any legitimate excuse to get out of the hothouse the Department calls a Squad Room, Sikes heads for the door beside the useless though unaccountably full coat rack. As he reaches it, however, Grazer calls to him, an obvious tactic of letting the entire room hear his words. \"Don't you think Bart Simpson's a little too young to be hanging around a Squad Room?\" \"Don't have a cow, man,\" he replies as the door swings shut. xx \"I fail to understand your continued irritation lately,\" George says as they wait for the elevator. Sikes bites back the snap he'd been about to aim at his partner; neither the heat nor George's biology are his fault – well, maybe his biology is. \"Look, I'm sorry, it's just this heat, as in too much .\" \"Well, I'll admit the last five days of temperatures over 90 degrees are a bit much, but–\" \"A bit much? It's a lot much! Humans aren't made for this kind of… stuff. I don't know how you guys can take it.\" \"Well, it helps when you're bald.\" The line, said so matter-of-factly, catches Sikes so off guard that he laughs, which does make him feel better. Considering for the moment his own perennially too-long hair, he has to agree. xx The Morgue is much more comfortable, a consequence of the many individual refrigeration units that line the wide left wall, the 'bleed-off' of which allows Dr. Lois Allen, the human Medical Examiner, to wear her long white smock indoors. \"Hi guys,\" she calls, pulling a plastic liner filled with bloody latex gloves from its container, sealing it and dropping the bag down a nearby chute. \"What can I do about you?\" She's known the pair too long for a combination of yellow 'Bart Simpson' tee shirt and suit buttoned to the neck to be notable to her. \"Howdy, Drac, just came in to check out a few bodies.\" \"Didn't know you were so desperate, Sikes.\" \"We're here to see a Newcomer named Victoria Seacret,\" George explains quickly, determined to cut off another round of verbal fencing. Really, Matt and this woman engage in so much of it that he sometimes expects they will either resort to dueling with scalpels or copulating on one of the metal tables, neither prospect being one he wants to witness. \"Right over here,\" Lois replies, leading them to the refrigeration units. Placing her hand on the latch of a waist high door three columns from the right wall, she turns to caution them. \"Not a pretty sight; a thirteen story fall onto the back of the head never is.\" She pulls open the door and slides out the metal platform to reveal a woman's body covered to her shoulders by a blue shroud and the detectives see she hadn't overstated the warning. The back of the Newcomer's head is caved in where she'd taken the force of the impact. \"Her body's covered with glass cuts from going through that window, but the cause of death is the shattering of the Occipital and Parietal bones of the skull driving jagged fragments through her brain as well as shattering of her third through fifth cervical vertebrae, rupturing and breakage of the levator scapulae muscles - broken neck - and fracturing of both scapula, that added to tearing and dislocation of several Tenctonese-specific muscles.\" \"Positive ID? Anything found on the body?\" Sikes asked. \"There was nothing found on the body, Matt; she was naked as an egg. Witnesses at the scene identified her, residents of the building she jumped... fell from.\" She knows better than to draw this conclusion. The detectives already have much of this information and read it while in the elevator; the Patrol Unit went up, got into the apartment, the roommate returned home at the height of the night's investigation…. x \"What else did you get?\" \"Evidence of recent sexual activity, penetration, all the classics, including motive sperm in the vaginal canal.\" \"Human or Newcomer?\" \"Human, and I make the time of death no longer than an hour afterwards, possibly as little as a half-hour. There are indications of sexual stimulation in her system as well, her body seemed to still be actively reacting as it would to such stimulation; constriction, lubrication and so on, when she died. Even with a Human woman I would hesitate to say the event took place longer than about fifteen minutes to a half hour before death.\" The usual result of sex isn't flying through a window. \"Do you think she was raped?\" The woman shakes her head. \"Rape is a legal term,\" she says, telling them something they know so well. \"I found penetration, sperm, lubrication, constriction; you'll have to tell me if she was a willing participant, I can only say she was an active one.\" \"Did you run a DNA check on the sperm?\" \"Running now; check in this time tomorrow and I'll let you know what I have.\" \"What was Dr. Kildare's opinion,\" George asks, referring to her Tenctonese partner. \"He's on vacation,\" she answers with a trace of irritation in her tone. She's known the pair for a long time and tells herself George is neither questioning her competence nor exhibiting a preference to hear it from one of his own kind. It doesn't work. \"Frankenstein's out scaring up business?\" Sometimes, though she's as much as active participant in the verbal fencing as he is, she tends to lose patience with Matt's teasing. \"Yeah, but Dracula's still here, so be careful or I'll bite you.\" \"Oh, Lo, you know you're still the only ghoul for me.\" \"OUT!\"[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Language For the cross-town trip Matt turns up the air conditioner to full force, despite George's cautioning that the heat and humidity will only have a greater effect on him when he gets out. Of course, Matt has to admit his partner is right and that does little to help his mood, nor does it stop him from seeking as much satisfaction from the cold air as possible. \"I've got a feeling the weather isn't the only thing that's going to be heating up by the time we're done. 'Sides, you're gonna feel the heat a lot more than I will.\" \"Matt, if it bothers you so much, I will change.\" \"Well….\" Matt begins, then checks himself. \"I'm only thinking of you. It's not necessary to look like you're going out on a date. You stand out – and looking at you so bundled up only makes me hot.\" \"You are not my type.\" Matt isn't sure if he's going to choke or drive off the street. xx The 'death site' – how he hates those titles – on Murray Street is hard to miss. The moment they turn onto the street they see the black and white patrol car parked before it holds a pair of uniformed officers, human, and there's a woman in the back seat. Above the building's main door the name of the building is, as are so many things in Los Angeles, written in English above Newcomer characters: 'Tencton Arms'. Tenctonese writing mostly resembles the readouts of cardiac monitors, the sharp peaks and valleys accented by horizontal marks of varying length, together with horizontal breaks in height and coupled with the occasional dots, none of it Matt has ever managed to decipher in six years. He does, however, need little help interpreting George's expression; his partner finds the name as pretentious as he does. Matt parks directly opposite the patrol car, across the street from the huge gray building and, shields already tucked into belt and jacket pocket, they get out and cross before the unit, being certain their fellows recognize their right to violate the perimeter. While George pauses with the officers he goes directly to the rear door of the car, bends to look in. \"Ms. McGiver, I'm Detective Sergeant Matt Sikes, this is Detective George Francisco.\" The brunette woman opens the door and gets out. She's about mid/late-20's and wears a white blouse, brown skirt and grief so intense as to be palpable. Matt sees she's been crying, perhaps for a long time though he'll reserve judgment on that and upon its sincerity. From the file he'd learned she'd been dropped off by friends at about 2:30 this morning to find police cars, an ambulance, numerous curious bystanders and news of a dead roommate. \"Hello,\" she says with a voice that couldn't get much tinier without fading away completely. \"We understand this is difficult for you,\" George tells her as the two uniformed officers, one Caucasian, one Asian, join them, \"but we need to examine your apartment and to have you tell us all you can about what happened to your roommate.\" She nods, seeming unable to say more. Though no one is present on the street, Matt feels he's been recognized a dozen times already. \"We're not supposed to be assigned to our own neighborhoods,\" he says too quietly for the woman to pick up. George, ignoring his partner's irritation, does have to admit he is the only one he's seen today who is 'dressed for dinner'. There's a store part way down the street where he might find a solution to that problem, however, and hopefully cheer his partner up. Matt reaches the vestibule first, silently exulting in the cool air that wraps itself about him like a frigid lover and wiping off the layer of perspiration from his forehead. Though the vestibule is accessed by an outer and inner door and the entire street facing wall is a set of huge windows, it's gloriously cool and Matt feels his spirits rise. Their footsteps echo hollowly in the spacious marble hall as they make their way to the elevator in the wall ahead. The interior of the car isn't significantly larger than necessary to hold five people, and it looks out on every floor through a grilled window as the car is hoisted noisily upward. \"Thirteenth floor,\" George muses. \"In so many cultures, it is considered so unlucky it is generally omitted from structures.\" \"Maybe the Architect was a materialist,\" Matt says dismissively. It could certainly have been omitted from Victoria Seacret's life. \"We always considered the 13th floor lucky,\" Erika says wistfully. \"Vicky said that if all the world didn't believe in 13 being lucky, it left more for us.\" \"That's an interesting philosophy,\" George observes, particularly so in coming from a Newcomer. Erika seems lost in her misery, unable to force out anything more. When the door opens, admitting them to a lobby that runs left and right, they see before them a white on black sign emblazoned with the number 13. Below it, someone had hung a sign whose tape had long ago yellowed with age. 'Abandon hope, all you who enter here.' \"Dante's 'Inferno',\" George identifies. \"Figures.\" The coolness that characterized the lobby and elevator has deserted them and Matt checks that he has his handkerchief. He expects to be able to wring it out by the end of the day. x It isn't hard to identify the apartment which is their target, the crisscrossing yellow tape marks it for all to see. There's also an adhesive sign adhered to the door, partially on the door, part on the frame, declaring this to be a Crime Scene and forbidding unauthorized entry. The backing is so strong it cannot even be carefully peeled away without leaving evidence of the breach. Far from the anonymity an unmarked door would hold, these things draw attention. Sikes, having received silent confirmation from one of the officers that he has an additional seal, writes his and George's initials on the corner and uses his pen to slice the paper. Erika unlocks the door and George unsticks the yellow tape from the left side, allowing them to pass. The living room before them is dominated by a large brown couch set in the middle of the floor, back to them and flanked by two lamp stands. A single closed door to the left apparently leads to the rest of the apartment, and to the right is the kitchen dominated by a square butcher block table. At the living room's left stand a stereo and a bookcase crammed with books together with a bubbling aquarium in which swim several small fish. In the right corner stands a three tier computer workstation with printer above monitor. The couch faces a television and entertainment center flanked by two red curtained windows. The left window has an air conditioner, turned off, while the curtain on the right flutters before the smashed window. The carpet has a large, square hole, about three feet to a side, cut to the bare floor in front of the television. Evidently the Forensics team found something of acute interest. \"I still can't believe it,\" Erika says, looking about the room, but mostly seeing the cut out carpet and the fluttering red drape. \"I half expected to unlock the door and see her, and then you two would disappear and it would all be a dream.\" Neither man comments on that. McGiver struggles to speak normally, it's some time before she can say \"By the time I got home she was gone, but I saw the blood by the curb and I knew. I looked up, saw our window and I knew.\" \"Do many Tenctonese live here?\" George asks. He's already set the uniformed officers to gathering more pictures and other documentation of the scene, regardless of what their fellows might have done last night. \"A little less than half,\" McGiver looks up at him and stretches a smile that doesn't reach her eyes, \"and yes, I think the sign's pretentious too. The landlord had visions of cornering the market, he's a Newcomer too, but a lot of the older residents didn't go along with it so in about 3 years of trying he hasn't had much to show for it.\" \"Do you have much trouble here?\" Friction between Newcomers and Humans can sometimes be course. \"Not particularly. The Newcomers that are here are kind of like the Humans, middle class or slightly upscale, but similar enough that we get along. There's even an integrated couple.\" \"What about you?\" Matt asks. \"We weren't a couple, if that's what you mean, but we were close.\" She still has the distant, haunted air of one in shock, trying to cope with an unaccountable situation. \"Not too many people could understand - a Human and a Tenctonese being friends, though looking at you two I suspect you can.\" \"What can you tell us about Miss Seacret?\" Matt asks, not wanting to get into the dynamics of their relationship and the year plus it took to get to this point. \"Yes. She was popular and everyone did like her.\" To Matt, it seems a trifle emphatic, as though she's trying to convince them her friend could be popular. Was it defensive, or something more? During the whole of their conversation she stands tensely, hands clenched before her so tightly the blood is forced from white skin and occasionally her eyes are locked onto the past. x \"What did Miss Seacret do for a living?\" He hopes she won't say 'designs lingerie'. \"She's… was a teacher; privately, actually, not connected to any school. Her students are … were mostly human and she taught Tenctonese language and culture. I teach human history and culture to the Tenctonese.\" \"I wasn't aware there was such a demand,\" George admits, impressed and slightly surprised that humans in large numbers would show such a broadminded interest. \"Enough to keep us here,\" Erika replies, her hand expansively sweeping the apartment. While not lavish, it's big, which in these days of burgeoning population is something of an accomplishment. \"We met in Sociology at UCLA two years ago and got the idea for a partnership.\" \"Do you work out of here?\" \"Yes, we do – we did, I mean.\" Erika's composure teeters precariously as she seems for a moment to come back into the present. \"You speak Tenctonese?\" George asks, receiving the answer in that language, which begins a conversation that consists of obscure words that sound like a 33 record run backward at 45, punctuated by clicks and sharp tongue clucks, all of which leaves Matt particularly nonplussed to hear an attractive human woman conversing in a language seemingly designed to twist a tongue into Gordian knots. After what's, for him, a very magnanimous period, Matt's had enough. \"Okay, Orgjay, ixnay on the Enctonesetay.\" \"Ah, of course, Matthew.\" George seems quite satisfied and Matt will find out later from him what the barrage of obbleygooktay revealed. \"Did she have any close male friends?\" George asks, this time in blessed English. \"Of course! I said she has – had a lot of friends!\" George and Matt exchange glances. Clearly she hadn't understood. \"I meant close human friends,\" George clarifies, leaning closer. Her blank expression is eloquent enough. \"The tests indicated that she had had sexual intercourse with a human about one half hour before she died. The police reports indicated that her clothing had been found scattered throughout this room.\" Erika had been fighting to maintain her self control, but George's words place the facts, which she had known, squarely before her eyes in a way she can no longer deny. Erika loses her battle, weeping bitterly into her hands. \"Yes!\" she cries brokenly, \"I knew about the clothes! I knew she'd been on the floor over there!\" She stabs the air with her finger, pointing in front of the television to where a large section of the carpet had been removed. \"But I couldn't think she'd been….\" \"Raped?\" Erika cries even more violently and Matt motions for George to desist. The woman is in the present now, and they don't want to drive her out again. As it is, only by close attention can they make out what she's weeping. Matt particularly picked up on why McGiver jumped right to rape. Granted the floor, if indeed they did do it there, is less comfortable than the couch, but sometimes things just get started and move on. \"How do you know she just didn't...?\" \"She used to have students up here, but for lessons! No one ever tried anything! She wouldn't permit it. She was only interested in Tenctonese – she told me she'd never have a human!\" Erika's speech grows more incoherent, the anger rising. With her first break all her emotions were released at once and she weeps inconsolably, and when she looks up her eyes are filled with terrible fire. \"And some filthy bastard murdered her for it !\" x \"Can we see a record of her students?\" George obviously asked to distract her from her emotion, but Matt is unprepared for the violence of her reaction; she rushes to a cabinet beside the computer work stand, rips the wooden door open, yanks out a plastic ring binder and throws it at them. It misses, sailing to thump against the door. \"Take it,\" she screams, \"take it and find that filthy bastard and make him pay for what he did to Vicky !\" She turns, burying her face in her hands while George goes to her but halts, uncertain what comfort he could possibly offer as Matt retrieves the green binder.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three Diras'ti Matt Sikes escorts Erica McGiver downstairs and directs the uniformed officers to take her with them, to return her to the hotel room she's using for the time that the apartment is a declared 'Crime Scene'. \"Okay, George, what did you pick up in that Berlitz barrage?\" His partner and the young woman had spent quite a bit of time earlier conversing in that tongue-torturing language. \"Ms. McGiver's knowledge of the Tenctonese language is competent; she can carry on a reasonable conversation with it, but her accent is not the best. She could, as she indicates, teach it but her level of skill is conversational rather than fluent.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes,\" George confirms, missing or ignoring the sarcasm. \"One or two times she used an incorrect verb form, but on the whole I found her competence acceptable.\" \"So she'd be an okay teacher?\" \"Of humans, yes. Not of Tenctonese, at least not of Emily or Vessna.\" \"Well, it's a bit early for Vessna, isn't it?\" Maybe by the time the several month old infant is ready to talk– \"She said 'lanyu' yesterday.\" Seeing Matt's vague look, he elaborates \"That is the equivalent of 'mama'.\" \"Get outta town. You must be really proud.\" \"Yes, I am.\" It's evident to him that Matt is also proud of his goddaughter. x In the hallway an hour later, while waiting for the elevator, Matt and George look over the record of the late Victoria Seacret's language students. The binder contains detailed reports of each student's progress, appears to be updated to paper regularly and is printed with graphs as well as tables and text. The detail extends to the physical characteristics of each of her 34 students. \"When that DNA test comes back, we may be able to use this to narrow the field.\" \"I'm inclined to think this record will be of little use,\" George counters and Matt has to agree with the pessimistic tone. The binder is separated by multi-colored tabs containing the students' names and, of the thirty four, nineteen are women of varying ages, leaving only fifteen. \"I know, but it's a lead and so far we're not swimming in them.\" He wipes his forehead, wishing he's come up with a better analogy. In their canvass of potential witnesses, only an interview of the couple next door to the crime scene had been of any use. Frank and Rosalyn Martin had heard what sounded like an especially loud teapot whistle running unattended for several minutes, and only when it had been taken off the stove had they tried to get to sleep. But Frank Martin was still awake a half hour later when the crash of the window, and Victoria's descending and suddenly aborted scream had torn sleep from his mind. Rather than going to the window, where the sounds had told him clearly that there was no help, he'd rushed to the apartment door, thrown it open and saw no one, nor did anyone ever attempt to leave the women's apartment. Rosalyn Martin had gone to the window, saw the body far below and had called the police. It turned out hers was one of many 911 calls to deluge the board within a two minute span. 'I can't believe it! I won't!' Erika McGiver had declared before the officers had taken her, when Matt expressed his initial belief that the evidence seemed to point most strongly to suicide. Actually he'd said 'off herself', but it came out to the same. 'She wouldn't commit suicide!' Erika had maintained with fiery fervor. 'She loved life, had everything to live for. Someone threw her out that damned window!' x But if this is so, and if Frank Martin had made it to the door as quickly as he stated - it's yet to be proven - how did the assailant escape the apartment before the police arrived? And now George isn't helping the suicide theory. \"A person committing Diras'ti often leaves–\" \"What?\" The door to the elevator opens, they get aboard. \"Diras'ti, a form of ritual suicide. We Newcomers place a high value on life and do not take it indiscriminately.\" He stops, and Matt knows he's caught short by the number of situations they've dealt with that belie the claim, but he apparently pushes these aside. \"There are certain prescribed methods, none of which involve throwing one's self through a pane of glass to fall thirteen stories into the street. A Newcomer often leaves a note or some message to loved ones, yet none was found. Further, a person driven to such extreme action is frequently solicitous of others and does not want to cause undue inconvenience to friends and relatives.\" \"As if suicide wasn't inconvenient.\" \"Victoria Seacret seems particularly meticulous,\" he insists, holding up the reports. \"You felt how hot that apartment has become; the air conditioner is useless until the window is replaced. Erika herself seems to feel Victoria would not have left her in such a state. Furthermore, the average suicide – even excluding that this is not one of the prescribed methods of Diras'ti – would open a window first, not take a flying leap through a pane of glass.\" \"I thought you would've told me Newcomers don't commit suicide.\" \"I wish I could. However, two hundred fifty thousand slaves crammed onto a single six mile diameter ship for years at a time, suffering tortures every day with no discernible way out; it was not unknown.\" Seeing his friend's eyes, Matt can only conclude \"I think you're developing a talent for understatement.\" \"I'm just saying–\" \"All right! All right, Sherlock, you're so convinced it wasn't suicide, then where's the killer? The door's self-locking from the inside and Frank Martin was watching the hall until the Unit arrived. The only way out was to follow Seacret, so where's the killer?\" \"I do not know.\" The door slides open, admitting a waft of cooler air from the large hall which chills Matt and his sweat dampened clothes. \"Well, I want to interview the witnesses from the street. Who were they again?\" \"Ellen and Jackie Pu, 1423 Parker, apartment 4A. Ellen works at Metropolitan Hospital, Pediatrics Ward and should be on duty. Her sister Jackie is a model and may well be best reached at home or through Agency.\" x Sometimes George's memory is better than a computer. \"Okay, we'll hit the hospital first.\" When they step onto the street, the heat strikes them with a sledgehammer blow and Matt checks his watch. Noon. This is going to be hell. \"I'll be just a moment,\" George says, crossing the street but going around the car. \"I want to purchase something in that store.\" Matt gets into the car, starts it and, taking advantage of the opportunity again, turns the air conditioner on full. It's considerably longer than a moment before George emerges from the store, returns to the car and takes the keys from Matt, goes to the trunk and, when he returns a minute later he's disposed of his jacket, tie and white shirt. \" Whoa , George,\" Matt exclaims when he sees George's deep blue printed tee shirt, \"that's a different look for you.\" The image is of Ezri Dax from 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'. Nicole deBoer is quite out of uniform, seated seductively upon a stool and wearing not a lot of a red bikini. \"Her speckles are very suggestive, not accurate for a Tenctonese but extend so far as to be extremely erotic.\" \"Then you'd better not let Susan see you wearing that.\" \"Well, I have to admit you were right about my standing out. And with what you said earlier about what I was wearing making you hot, I felt I should choose something we can both live with.\" xxx Only a mile away a 17 year old Tenctonese woman, who at the age of 11 was tagged with the name Cheshire, her family with the surname Katt, steps off the elevator of her apartment building. Her arms are loaded with a heavy grocery bag and a young human, similarly burdened, steps off with her. \"I can't thank you enough for this; I couldn't have made it alone.\" \"Think nothing of it. Believe me, I'm glad to help,\" he assures her as they walk down the hall to her apartment. \"I really do appreciate this,\" she says, fumbling to get her keys from the gold shoulder bag. \"My parents will be out for hours, but I have to have dinner ready when they get in.\" Opening the door, she turns to take the second bag from him. \"Don't be silly. I never leave a job half-done,\" he says as charmingly as he can. She smiles, pushes the door open and leads him in. The apartment is fairly large, replete with reproductions of Tenctonese art and artifacts. Putting her bag down on a table, she turns and takes his as well. \"As long as you're here, can I get you something?\" she asks, setting down his bag next to her own. \"You sure can.\" He reaches into his pocket and a steady, high pitched tone sounds from the white device he draws from his jeans. She freezes, frightened; she knows that sound but from years ago. She doesn't recognize the instrument that produces it, but no Tenctonese woman, having heard that perversion, could ever fail to recognize it. x She backs away, fear making her breath race. \" Celine ! What are you doing?\" Her gracious, solicitous helper stands before her, grinning in malicious anticipation. \"I think you know, honey.\" She does know, but it's too unbelievable to be real. The sound immediately made is effect upon her, stimulating her, quickening her breath as it invades her nerves. She clamps her hands over her ear valleys. It's hopeless. She needn't hear the sound, she feels it, feels the rush of sexual desire building in her, threatening to consume her. \"Nee! (No) Stop it! Sela stop it! Sela – Please!\" She can't stop her mounting passions, can't concentrate on speaking English, not when ignited by that steady, abusive sound that plays on her nerves, that make the speckles on her back tingle and resonate in the serxi cluster surrounding the canal between her legs, that stimulate it to produce the moisture needed to ready her to receive a gannaum's aklafluid or the binnaum's catalyst for…. She fights it, but the tension, the hot desire, the need consume her. She can't fight it – no woman could fight this! Terror wells up in her as she remembers the last time she'd heard this sound, remembers the time…! \" Please ! I'll do anything you want – but sela – stop !\" He brings the damned sound closer, tears her nerves apart. \"Oh, you'll do what I want, bitch – and very soon. You'll love it.\" Her body responds with mounting passion despite her desperate resistance. Burning lust flares through her and she can't stop it! Her breasts rub against her blouse with every gasping breath. They feel so maddeningly sensitive. Her nipples poke against the once soft material. She feels the mounting need center about her vulva. Her Potniki speckles that trail down her back feel alive in their sensitivity and she longs to caress herself, to ease the maddening need - but she doesn't dare! \" Sela !\" she begs fearfully. She knows that if he doesn't stop, then it's only a matter of time before the sensations that fill her body, that threaten to consume her, rip all self-control from her. Her breasts ache to be touched, long to be fondled! Her spots, even those on her head, tingle maddeningly. She looks at the bulge in his pants and her own crotch flares, moistens despite her misery. Tears flow down her cheeks as she pleads despondently. She hates her body's responses and can't stop them. Her body needs him! She has to have his– But that sound , that damnable noise. She'd never let this tert touch her and she has no choice . Terrified, she tries to bolt for the door but her uncoordinated body betrays her again. He catches her easily, pulls her roughly against his body. His hand across her back makes her speckles flare with sensation that shoots through her like lightning, some flashes of lust seem to dart directly down between her legs. Every touch flares through her; every touch, as she struggles, fires her passion worse. His hand is on the small of her back, a powerful erogenous zone without the abusive noise and she's undone. x Her steaming flesh, under that unrelenting, merciless assault of sound, betrays her with fiery lust. His hand pressing her to him works its own abuse. She tries to speak but only lustful groans and sighs emerge. She tries to resist as he yanks open her blouse, but she can't push him back as his hand fondles her breast possessively. She wants to fight him but he brings the whistling device down, presses it to her crotch and now the sound and vibration together tear at her nerves. She screams as her body convulses in horrendous orgasm. He forces her down onto her back, though no force is needed - her body willingly submits though her mind screams. She lies on her back, writhing and screaming as the sound tears every nerve in her body apart; but the sensation is centered doubly in her moistening, heating crotch. Her body is preparing, ready to receive his aklafluid and this tert doesn't even have any! He presses the device to her vagina and she shrieks, writhing madly, orgasms flaring mercilessly through her. He's driving her upward! She's already entered desonekarar, she can't think to even care what stage but it's building , ripping her mind from her! She cries, shrieks, pleads for mercy as he kneels over her, ripping her clothes as her body flails in one monstrous orgasm after another. He's tearing her clothes off, the device pressed to her soaked crotch as she thrashes madly, shrieking as desonekarar builds from one level to the next, always upward, always ripping her mind as it tears at her body. His hand on her breasts drives her mad, her mind is blasted at his assault. She screams and screams, tears flowing down her face as he presses the tool to her convulsing labia. \"Yeah. You slag bitches all love it! You love it!\" He mounts her, moving the device between her breasts, pressing them together about it, the sound blasting her nerves as she shrieks, weeping as she orgasms. She screams as she feels him thrust through her clamping muscles, feels herself convulse around his brutal member that tears into her and she screeches as orgasm is stabbed by agony. \" Yeah , you sponge-headed bitch! Take it deep in your cunt! You love it, slag ! You all love it!\" xxx \"It was horrible, Officers,\" Nurse Ellen Pu tells George and Matt. \"I think I'll see that poor woman falling for the rest of my life.\" She sits in the small private office of the Ward's Chief Nurse, her uniform of crisp, immaculate white actually contrasts with her pink arms. The only other spot of color is the white on blue name tag, marked 'E. Pu', pinned over her left breast. She faces the two detectives, one human, one Tenctonese, yet her eyes can only see that woman's broken body, the pink blood draining from her shattered head. \"What was the first thing you heard or saw?\" Matt asks. \"The window breaking, then her scream,\" she says, barely meeting his eyes. \"When she fell, did you get a sense of whether she jumped or was pushed?\" Even as he asks the question, he knows the answer would be inadmissible. However the body had been found fourteen feet from the base of the building, and the glass had scattered throughout the street; these could not have come from a fall. \"I'm sorry, Sergeant. As she fell, she tumbled, but I can't possibly say for certain which it was.\" Matt actually prefers that answer to a definite decision. He likes a witness who doesn't take things for granted, who won't jump to conclusions about what she saw. \"All right, can you tell us any more?\" \"Do you think I might be called as a witness?\" she asks apprehensively. \"I couldn't say.\" George says something in Tenctonese that seems to reassure her, and as usual Matt has no idea what it is, which normally annoys him greatly. This time, however, he withholds his irritation. The Tenctonese grew up as slaves, many still equate the police with their Overseers, the Kleezant sun . Sometimes reassurance that they won't suffer in the presence of the police is necessary. At any rate, they learn enough about what both Ellen and her sister Jackie saw to be able to put together a fairly accurate picture while keeping enough good will so they can come back for more information. Ellen has the mind of a keen observer and Matt hopes Jackie will be as reliable. The last exchange is what particularly sticks in Matt's mind; it was he'd asked her about her background. \"On the ship I was a Physician, but after Quarantine and processing I found I had to specialize in Pediatrics. It was a difficult adjustment, learning to deal almost exclusively with children, but now I like it.\" \"I don't understand.\" Processing by the INS assigned human names – at times very badly – but they didn't determine a Newcomer's occupation. \"How'd Immigration restrict you to Pediatrics?\" She tapped her name badge. \"I found out that, on this planet, Pediatrics is the only Medical discipline in which I could be taken at all seriously with a name like 'Nurse E. Pu'.\" xxx Unlike Ellen, Jackie Pu turned out to be a disappointment for the detectives. She wasn't inclined to talk, even in her native tongue, because she feared the publicity would hinder her chances of employment. Though they tried to assure her of anonymity, she was so unwilling Matt finally concluded they weren't going to get anything useful from her. At nearly the end of their shift, the Detectives return to the Squad Room for the long process of preparing reports. As happens too often, those reports are and have to remain incomplete; hardly a crime on the first day of an investigation except to those with unrealistic expectations. This, however, isn't what bothers Matt most. Although they're no closer to solving the initial question of murder or suicide, he can't agree with George's contention, no matter how valid it sounds, that it wasn't suicide. He doesn't like definite conclusions this early in an Investigation. There's something wrong, something incomplete, something that seems to hover just on the edge, like mist barely seen but which one knows is there, if he can just– \"Pin-ups, Francisco?\" Bryon Grazer asks, announcing his presence and completely derailing Matt's thoughts \"Sorry, Captain.\" \"Not half as much as you'll be when Susan sees it,\" Sikes predicts. \"Come on, George, let's call it a day.\" But as usual he has a long and ever lengthening list of things he'd rather call it.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Desonekarar Returning home still in no enviable mood, Matt is neither surprised nor displeased when the first person he encounters in his own second story hallway turns out to be his neighbor Cathy Frankel just exiting her apartment opposite the elevator. The delightfully attractive Tenctonese woman lives across and down the hall from him and her presence, or even just the sight of her, is enough to blast Matt out of any possible funk. Actually, with the exception of George's wife Susan – and this he'll admit to no living person – Cathy is the only Newcomer woman he does find particularly beautiful. He's seen many that can be called beautiful, but only two he'd consider exceptional and this doesn't always come just from physical looks. He has a friendship-relationship with her that can be likened to bobbing up and down in opposite peaks and valleys on fifteen foot waves on the ocean in two rowboats ... and he's 100 percent certain she knows exactly what she's doing to his hormones, nerves and, such as it is when he's around her, his brain. What does surprise Matt this evening isn't seeing the woman dressed in her usual elegant silky attire – today it's a swoosh of a blue and green blouse that seems to flow down her body and carry the scheme to her mid-length skirt, but suddenly he doesn't mind the heat wave. No, it's because for one not into personal adornment, this time she wears about her head, as another woman would wear a hair band, a thin silver band so deeply incised with Tenctonese script that it sparkles even in the inadequate hall light. \"Hi, Matt,\" she exclaims, glowing with even more than her usual good spirits and he realizes it's been only one second since they'd seen each other. She shuts her door without turning from him. x \"Hi Cath. How was your day?\" 'Okay, so it's a stupid line,' he thinks, 'but who can think with–?' \"Marvelous!\" she exclaims with a broad smile. She comes to him and gives him a brief Tenctonese greeting, touching the side of her head, near her temple, to his; but when she draws back he isn't so dense, seeing the way she subtly moves her head so that the band glistens in his eyes, that he misses that she really wants him to ask about it. The slim silver band seems to accent her multitude of Podniki spots, which in her case are so densely clustered as to almost give the illusion of very short hair. Few people are aware, or take the effort to notice, that one can read these markings, passed along male and female lines, to determine family and other distinguishing facts, such as Albert's denoting his status as a Binnaum. He's long ago noted that Emily, and later Vessna, take after Susan while Buck is more patterned after George. To date, he's never met a newcomer with Cathy's pattern – and he's sure they've looked among the Newcomers, for to find similar patterning is to find family, however distantly related. \"A present?\" \"Uh, huh.\" She says it with such a dazzling smile that, for a moment, he can't resist a twinge of jealousy. It's irrational, he admits; it looks way out of his range, but if anybody should be giving her a gift like that…. \"To myself.\" Caught flatfooted, knowing his face must, as usual, be far too easy to read, the best he can manage is \"Huh?\" \"Today's my Prinyante .\" x Not wanting to repeat himself, he forces himself to say nothing. Her smile isn't without its element of teasing. \"Naming Day. You see, we're born into slavery, so there's little use in celebrating birthdays like humans do. But our names are the first things given us by our parents, and they are often given in defiance of our slave status. The Kleezant sun give us names at birth, but I never use that .\" He's never been able to come close to duplicating that curious popping sound at the end of the word, but only Cathy seems able to make so ominous a word's ending sound 'cute'; and that's something he would never dare say aloud. \"I only know you by Jelana, but I'm used to Cathy.\" Somehow, in her effervescence, he can see a touch of apprehension in her hazel eyes. \"I like Jelana.\" Immediately she brightens again. \"You know, I think I like it more than 'Cathy'.\" He hadn't thought it possible for her spirits to pick up any more than they already were, and he has to admit that it makes him feel better as well. \"You know, Earth names generally mean something. Does yours?\" \"Uh, huh,\" she assures him with a dazzling smile. \"What?\" She draws closer, very much closer, her hands move to his shoulders, her lips get closer, closer, they're a hair apart - Tenctonese don't kiss but Matt 's heart start to race in anticipation. \"Someday,\" she whispers, her orange scented breath fluttering on his lips, \"I might tell you.\" She withdraws and he's taken aback, but this time he doesn't mind. He'll let her have her secret … and play the game out later. \"Well, I don't know what Tenctonese custom is, but I think this occasion calls for a drink. Would you join me?\" \"I'd love to.\" She tries to keep her feelings from showing too clearly in her manner. A chase game is no fun if the prize is scared off. x Not for the first time, as they walk the extra few steps to Matt's door on their right, he has the feeling that he's treading uncertain ground with the complexities of Tenctonese custom and society. He always felt there's one more surprise waiting for him, but he doesn't like surprises; too much chance to fail – or is it to succeed gloriously? But he feels very often with Cathy – Jelana – like he's walking blindfolded through a garden where the flowers hide land mines, and to get too close to the flowers is to…. He opens the door to a mildly embarrassing surprise of his own. The television set on the other side of the kitchen/living room partition, is on, the local news program just concluding its announcements to the vacant room. He remembers watching it this morning at breakfast and then had absentmindedly departed for work. Trying to cover his embarrassment by pretending there's nothing unusual about it, he closes the door and, under the guise of meaningless small talk, enters the kitchen immediately to his left. \"I've got a gallon of milk in.\" Both of them ignore the television and miss its warning announcement of a test of the country's Emergency Broadcast System. \"A gallon ?\" she laughs; to Matt a delightful sound. \"You know, you have more milk than any other human I've ever met.\" She steps toward him, smiling suggestively, not missing his flicker of a glance at her legs in her almost long enough skirt, chosen today to particularly highlight just what he's been looking at before his eyes come up, before he remembers to look up to her eyes. \"I think you do it so you can get me drunk and have your way with me.\" He laughs, mostly to hide his feelings, the thought a little too close to home. This isn't the milk he keeps in the cupboard (beside the air fresheners) for when George visits, this is from the fridge. Fresh milk has about the same effect on a Tenctonese as slightly mild, low number proof wine would on a human; she'd probably have to consume the whole gallon to get tipsy. But he'd thought she'd enjoy it, which is why he keeps a steady supply of fresh milk in the hopes that she'll visit. He's more a beer man himself. x He turns, ducking his head in the refrigerator just as the high pitched tone of the Emergency Alert test fills the apartment. Head buried in the refrigerator, he misses Cathy's sharp gasp. He straightens several seconds later, turns toward her near the door and is surprised to find her collapsed against the wall, moaning sensuously, her body moving against her will. She can't keep her hips still as they grind sensually and she reaches up but chearly is forcing herself to keep her hands away from her heaving breasts. \"Cathy?\" She's moaning, gasping, helpless and so obviously sexually aroused he feels an immediate and very human response to her distress, to her unwilling movements - but then he remembers an incident from so many months ago. The Tenctonese nervous system is particularly sensitive to sound and this sound has a powerful erotic effect. Feeling like an imbecile that he'd forgotten about that accidental revelation of one of the Tenctonese' most carefully guarded secrets, he hurries around the partition to the television and switches it off. \"Oh!\" she exclaims, her system stunned and she starts to slide helplessly down the wall. He hurries back, reaches her, grabs her, supports her body in his arms. \" Cath ? Are you okay?\" She's gasping, moaning from lingering stimulation, from deep sexual arousal, and though she lies weak in his arms, held close to him, he can feel her two hearts pound arhythmically in her heaving chest. Her skin is pinker than it was moments ago and the distinctive spots covering her head seem darker. x \"Thank you!\" She welcomes a chance to be in his arms, but this is not the way she'd intended. The speckles that taper down her back tingle as though alive, stimulated by the aborted sound. Even her blouse rubbing against them as she breathes is making her more excited. She tries not to breathe. \"What would've happened if I hadn't turned it off?\" \"I wouldn't have been able to control myself! I think I'd–!\" She looks up and down his chest, all she can see of him while pressed so close , then covers her eyes to prevent him from seeing as they change from hazel ringed in blue to deep blue. She's trembling, stimulated to her very core and fighting to control it. Thank all the stars he hadn't touched her just then or she didn't think she could recover. As it is, she's fighting her body, her unexpectedly ignited lusts, trembling at the very edge of overwhelming arousal. Her body is betraying her. Every time she breathes her blouse tickles her Podniki spots on her back and strokes her equally sensitive breasts. It's all going wrong. She'd wanted to just see him, have a nice evening with him; that's why she'd waited so long within her apartment, attentive to the sounds beyond the door until she heard the elevator, heard his distinctive breathing and could make it out in the hallway in time to intercept him. But she hadn't meant to lose control of herself in the first two minutes! This is all going wrong . She'd never meant to get excited – that's crazy – but she hadn't expected to be attacked by his television! Matt is just as flustered as she is, but she can't allow this incident to deteriorate their relationship. She has to salvage it. x \"Cath?\" he calls, clutching her in his arms to support her better and without realizing it he presses his hand into her lower back. It rips the breath from her and then, with his other hand, he does the worst possible thing – he starts stroking her, running his hand up and down her back, strumming her stimulated speckles that blast their sensations throughout her heated body. \" Anailii !\" she cries, head thrown back, caught off guard by the unexpected surge. She hadn't recovered from the intense sexual stimulation produced by the abusive sound which drove her nerves insane and now his hands are on the physically most sensitive erogenous areas of her body. While she shares the same stimulating sites like the backs of her knees or the bridge of her nose, the small of her back has always been her undoing. The sound alone was horrible enough but wasn't on long enough to destroy her control but now he's strumming her speckles and pressing his hand on the most sensitive part of her back! Passion flares within her with mind-blasting intensity. She can only gasp, her best efforts to speak reduced to sensuous, aroused moans that can only–. Her chest heaves against him. She can't help it but the sensation of his chest against her breasts is ripping her control apart! She can see his panic as he holds her closer, tighter, now not strumming her but his arm is across both shoulder blades at once! He's pressing more firmly into her and she feels his crotch pressed unaware to hers. No, her body is pressing it to his! 'Help me! He doesn't realize! I'm not ready ! He's not ready! But he's driving me out of my mind! ' x Matt feels the heat of her body, can see the characteristic pink of her flesh grow deeper, notices peripherally how the spots on her head stand out in sharp relief but he didn't know, in trying to help, that the seizure that's making her gasp and moan is his fault. He holds her closer, trying to talk to her but she seems not to hear him and the more firmly he holds her up the worse she becomes. \"Help me! Nok' desone!\" she cries, that peculiar popping sound he's never come close to duplicating. \"You're going to– Help me !\" \"I'm trying !\" He holds her closer, trying to support her writhing body, keeping her pressed to him for support, her chest heaving. He keeps one hand pressed to the small of her back, the other arm across her shoulder blades, keeping her upright. She can't stop writhing against him, driven further and further out of control, feels her moistening crotch rub along him and she shrieks. He's unprepared as she grabs him, flings her arms about him, kisses him – Tenctonese don't kiss! – with wild abandon that's almost frightening. Surprised, he gives in to the delightful, if unexpected, opportunity and draws her closer to him, kisses her with the same fervor, her gasps lost in his mouth. But he doesn't realize the effect of his hands on her back, that erogenous area he'd learned about but forgot in the rush of the moment. His arm across her shoulder blades accentuates her erotic fire. x Cathy's body burns, pink flesh turning fiery in spiking lust; it drives her with primal need and she knows she's lost. Driven beyond endurance, she only knows now that she has to have the satisfaction her body craves. She needs him with an inferno that consumes thoughts, that blasts reason. He's stimulating her mercilessly; what that damned chord started he won't let her stop! She needs to feel his hard body against her fiery flesh. She clings to him as tightly as she can, driven beyond reason, presses her body to his, her lips to his in the human manner in fiery demand. Moaning in unbearable lust, in fiery need ignited by lightning, she can't resist any more, can't fight the lust, the need that tears at her, that consumes her, that defeats her! x Breaking the kiss, Matt gasps, pushes her away slightly, his strength no match for hers under the best of conditions. Newcomers average 30 percent stronger but she's …. \"Cath! Whoa ! Come up for air!\" In her fevered mind she knows only that he's trying to pull away, to push her away, to disengage his body from hers. No ! He can't do this, not after exciting her so much. ' Nok' desone!' she thinks with that fragment of her mind that can think. 'He can't do this! He can't push me away – not now !' She can't let him ! Matt, having gone with the flow, is taken completely by surprise as the burning, passionate woman in his arms becomes a lustful tigress. She gets her hands between the halves of his shirt and rips it from his body. She pulls hard at his belt as they tumble over![Chapter 5] Chapter Five Nok 'desone The Squad Room buzzes with its usual air of controlled chaos when Matt strolls in, goes directly to the small side room where the vending machines stand and selects breakfast: two Milky Way bars. \"It's a wonder you don't get fat,\" Detective Sergeant Dobson says from the doorway. \"I get plenty of exercise,\" Matt assures the taller man with a grin. \"And lately, I need all the energy I can get.\" He returns to browsing the selection, orders up a pack of M&Ms.; \"Home run last night, huh?\" Matt turns to him. \"What do you mean?\" The black man grins. \"I know you. One Milky Way, normal. Two and you had a date. M&Ms; and you scored.\" Matt grins as he walks past his friend. \"I ran out of change.\" A low whistle follows his stroll over to the pair of facing desks he shares with his Newcomer partner. He tosses his booty upon the controlled chaos that characterizes his workspace, a distinct difference from George's natty organization. Francisco has at least compromised today with a button down shirt by leaving off his jacket and tie. Today holds the promise of only 85 degrees, but this morning Matt doesn't care a bit about the heat. \"You're in a good mood, considering last evening,\" George observes. \"No, pal, considering last evening I am in a somber mood, because last evening is definitely a cause for high points.\" He tilts back precariously in his chair, resting his head in both hands and flapping his elbows like wings. \"Considering the evening I had, right now I'm practically brooding.\" He studies the ceiling, not caring much even if it falls down. \"So, what did Susan think of Ezri Dax?\" \"She told me the next time I get interested in heavenly bodies, I should stick to Sirius.\" Matt laughs and says with faux casualness: \"I hear Channel Four had an Emergency Broadcast test last night.\" x \"Yes,\" George replies with a somewhat smug smile, \"I was glad Buck and Emily had taken Vessna to the park, because it caused a considerable stir at home. Those things always get to Susan.\" George actually feels a little sorry for what Matt is missing; he'll never know the fortuitous circumstances that can spark special moments between a couple. Matt looks down at his friend, his hands still locked comfortably behind his head. \"Well, it caused a lot of excitement at my place too.\" George looks at him, openly surprised. 'Score One for the Earthman,' he thinks. \"Cathy was visiting when it came on. I turned it off the minute I realized what was up, and I tried to help her, but she was almost going to fall and I forgot about that spot on her lower back when I caught her. She wasn't recovering, not like last time, and then suddenly she was all over me .\" He grins at the memory. \"Suddenly?\" \"Well, maybe not suddenly, there was considerable build-up. As I said the lady just was not turning off. I tried to help, holding her up but then she was a wild woman.\" \"Desonekarar.\" \"Whatever. I couldn't stop her. She ripped my clothes to shreds.\" He grins, not counting the expense. After last night, a shirt reduced to rags is a very small loss. \"She was like a wild woman. I've never experienced anything like that in my life.\" He lets the chair fall forward. \"Man, it was like she couldn't get enough, I actually tried to push her away; I couldn't get her off me with a crowbar!\" It finally filters through his lingering delight that George is no longer smiling. \" Nok 'desone,\" George says in that peculiar pop/word combination he'd never come close to managing. He also could never reproduce that utterly ominous tone. \"You know, she said that too. I tried to help her, but I–\" \" How , Matt?\" George leans forward as far as he can across his desk. \" How did you try to help her?\" Confused, surprised by his intensity, Matt can only say \"She was going nuts, like she was aroused, but insanely, wildly aroused; I'd never seen anything like it. I was just trying to hold her on her feet–\" \"Your hand on the small of her back.\" \"Yeah, and I was kind of rubbing her back, you know, up and down….\" \"A stimulated Tenctonese woman and you rubbed her speckles.\" He shakes his head and Matt's outraged that his partner actually looks disgusted. \"And if I'm guessing right you also put your arm, say, across her shoulder blades.\" \"Yeah,\" Matt's really getting annoyed now. \"I was trying to help her, but you people don't exactly come with an Instruction Manual for when one of you starts having seizures. But she wasn't having no seizure; she was getting so hot, so out of control, I'd never seen….\" x He's completely unprepared when George gets up from his chair, comes to him, clamps a vice-like grip on his shoulder, yanks him from his chair and they're across the Squad Room before Matt can even think of fighting. George pulls him into the side snack room and closes the door. Only then does Matt manage to shove George's hand from his shoulder, but he's still too surprised at this exceptional treatment to be outraged. \"George, what the hell are you doing?\" \"It sounds –!\" He stops, takes a step back, literally as well as emotionally. \"It sounds like you drove her through desonekarar.\" \"Yeah, you said that, but what is it?\" He's beyond reacting in anger, worry for his friend overriding everything else. \"Desonekarar,\" George again takes a figurative step back, tries to communicate something intensely private without intensity. It takes him a few seconds to manage this and fortunately, though uncharacteristically, Matt keeps his mouth shut and lets him. \"Desonekararcan be loosely and inadequately translated as 'passion fever', but that's a shadow of its true meaning. It takes a lot to do and I'm surprised you managed it before she stopped you, but believe me if it had led to nok 'desone,\" again that peculiar popping sound that seems to accent so many of their words, \"that is something intensely feared by my people.\" They're not the only ones who are afraid. \"George, you'd better tell me straight what's going on.\" \"A woman …\" he seems unsure if he wants to reveal this, but Matt can see in his eyes that he's decided he has no choice. \"A Tenctonese woman driven into desonekarar, which has several stages, is ultimately wholly incapable of restraint or self-control. She is driven – she is aroused, sexually aroused, and must satisfy that arousal, to carry through the complete process.\" \"What 'complete process'?\" x George sighs, deeply frustrated. Why can't Matt read a book? Then again, he recalls, there are no books that cover this. \"Listen, you already know that the particular tone you heard, F# above high C, is a very stimulating tone to Tenctonese women.\" \"Yeah.\" He'd found out about that secret quite by accident, which is how he seems to learn most Tenctonese mysteries. \"Well, what you had done … look, you know what erogenous zones are.\" \"Of course , I do. I'm not stupid!\" \"No, Matt, you are not stupid,\" he concedes, sorry he's gotten the explanation so bollixed up. Time to take another mental step back. \"But listen, that tone is very erotic, but your government doesn't keep it on long enough to do more than stimulate desire. At that length the woman can recover if she wishes to, or in a case like Susan's last night if she did not want to stop it... What you did was to get to most of Cathy's erogenous zones and you kept stimulating her. That's what pushed her over the hill.\" \"Cliff, George.\" But he's not in the mood for correcting idioms, not where Cathy is concerned. \"Whew, I've had women go nuts on me before, but never like last night. She was like a wild woman; I wasn't even sure she knew me. Take a look at this.\" He lifts his blue polo shirt, displays a series of scratches that crisscross his chest and stomach. \"She did this tearing my shirt to ribbons. She broke my belt. She didn't break the buckle, she broke the belt .\" x George's expression is as wooden has his voice as he says quietly; \"Tell me what happened before that.\" \"Well….\" Normally he'd tell the story proudly, boastfully, but this conversation is more distressing than…. What had he missed? \"She heard the sound, started getting all worked up, I stopped it, she almost collapsed, I caught her. She fell against me and I was holding her up but she didn't seem to be recovering this time.\" \"You weren't letting her.\" \"Yeah, I realize that now.\" He fights back the aggravation. \"But she started kissing me, really working her body,\" \"Tenctonese women don't kiss.\" \"Well, Cathy does. Maybe she adapted, that is what you people do.\" He realizes belatedly that he had kissed her, she hadn't kissed him, but the evening is a bit of a jumble anyway. \"You wanna hear this story or not?\" \"Yes. I have a feeling we're both going to regret it.\" Matt, when he walked in this morning, would never have thought that. Now he's worried. x \"Well, anyhow, she was getting all excited, but as hot as she was getting, as aroused, there was fear there. I was trying to help her, holding her up, rubbing her back – it soothes humans !\" he insists in response to George's look, determining never to do that again without permission. \"I didn't know why she was afraid but between the gasping and moaning she didn't tell me. But when she was kissing me, she has better breath than I do and I couldn't breathe, I thought she was going to suffocate me and I started pushing her off.\" \"And that's when she attacked you?\" \"Yeah.\" Matt looks about, anywhere but in his partner's eyes, while his worry for Cathy mounts. \"She didn't stop. We didn't stop. I think we went on all night, at least it seemed, but when I woke up on the living room floor this morning she was gone. I thought she just went to work.\" \"Matt,\" George seems to be struggling with conflicting decisions, so common a thing with him when he finally decides to say \"there's something about us you don't know.\" \"No kidding .\" x George lets it pass. \"Tencton wasn't always the placid place we remember. Anciently, life expectancy was short. Now we live to about 140 Earth years, but long ago that wasn't so. I suppose we averaged about 40 Earth years.\" \"That's a big jump.\" \"Well, to maintain our race, women had to breed, undoubtedly more than they cared to, even with a four month gestation period between male and female. And nature provides a way to ensure survival of the species. You've already seen how touch can drive a woman to sexual excitement, to the first of many stages that together constitute desonekarar, and I have long appreciated your discretion in such matters; but due to our physiologies sound is also a stimulating sensation.\" Matt nods, wishing the man would get to the point so he can swallow down the fear that's growing in him. \"Well, to assure propagation, nature took it a step further. I'm only telling you this so you will understand why you have to keep it a secret. If a woman builds through the levels of arousal, of desonekarar, but does not carry through the full copulation, to reach a point roughly analogous to orgasm…. No, I take that back, there is no Human term for it, orgasm is only the beginning. Multiple orgasms, no, not even that, rather the … the full measure of fulfillment, what we call laaspaar; she must continue until she is completely sated.\" Under other circumstances Matt might have considered complete satiation through multiple orgasms - or would that be copious orgasms? - to be a good thing, but it sounds like the other shoe is about to drop and it's not going to be a good one. \"And if she doesn't?\" \"She suffers terrible termination seizures, severe cramps and spasms. It's called nok 'desone, an agonizing, torturous, horrendous convulsion of all the muscles and organs of the body. Imagine drug withdrawal coupled with grand mal epileptic seizures and the tortures of your Spanish Inquisition and multiply them ten times worse. Only completed laaspaar can relieve them.\" x \"That isn't right,\" Matt says feelingly. He tries to imagine any woman being subjected to that, and shies away from the thought as quickly as he can. George spreads his hands in a gesture of helplessness. He has no control over biology. \"I understand that Human men, left unsatisfied, experience extremely mild inconvenience.\" \"Mild?\" Matt then realizes George was speaking relatively. He's rarely seen his friend look so grim, and George could do grim better than anyone he knows when dealing with, and having to reveal, the inner secrets of his race. Right now Matt wants nothing other than to see Cathy, but he senses the story isn't over yet. \"Matt, are you certain you satisfied her?\" His initial resentment is aborted by the implications of the question. \"She was gone when I woke up; there was no answer at her apartment and I guessed she went to work.\" He has his cell phone out, but George's hand on his wrist halts him. \"Obviously you must have or she would have been incapable of leaving your apartment. I'm just saying, if this happens again, make certain that you do.\" x George is about to leave, but \"George, this knock desone is that bad, is it?\" George considers his answer carefully. He'd thought he'd explained that adequately. Normally he would never have discussed the subject at all, it being intensely personal to Tenctonese, but Matt deserves to know these things, both as a trusted partner and especially if he's going to carry on this relationship with Cathy Frankel. In fact, wherever that relationship is in its seemingly on-again-off-again journey, it has certainly entered a new phase now. \"It can be good or bad,\" he says confidentially. \"For a married couple, when desonekarar achieves its natural result of laaspaar , as I'm sure it must have between you two last night or you would have known it right then – it'd probably have scared you half to death – it provides the woman with a degree of bliss and satisfaction unattainable under any other circumstances. Then it can be wondrous. Arousal is one thing; think of multiple orgasms as stage 3, the attainment of laaspaar as stage 9.\" He pauses significantly. \"I understand human women are capable of multiple orgasms?\" \"Not like last night. Evening through night, I'm lucky I survived.\" But then memory washes away delight. \"But she wasn't just desperate, she was begging me for help. She was scared. This - this knock desone, I had no idea what she was saying, but it frightened her. She wasn't looking for 'las pa-ar' then, not that I had any idea about it, she was scared . I wouldn't have been holding her like I was if she weren't scared of something I couldn't see.\" x George's expression darkens. \"As with anything else, good things can be perverted. On the ship, the Kleezant sun used it to force women to mate, to breed, to ensure the slave population. Remember I told you suicide was not unknown; so the Overseers decided it was necessary to maintain the population. Or they would use it to punish.\" \" Punish ?\" Sexual stimulation as punishment? He's sure he doesn't want to hear this, but if it will help him understand Cathy's fear…. \"You see, your Emergency Broadcast System tone test, which remains active for a matter of seconds, results in stimulation but rarely goes beyond a measure of … arousal. The sound affects women's nerves. Well, the Kleezant sun were merciless in their application; they would inflict it upon the slaves until they could not help but breed with the aid of a Binnaum, being utterly unable to resist the stimulation. But if you–\" He turns away sharply, fists clenched at his side. \"George?\" x \"If you… restrain the woman so she cannot achieve laaspaar… if she is kept only building through the levels of desonekarar and then all stimulation is withdrawn ….\" He turns back and the horrible look in his eyes makes Matt retreat a step. There's terrible outrage in those eyes, worse fury in that tightly restricted voice, that frightens Matt. \"They did it to Suse once.\" Matt feels a chill go through his body as he sees the past in his friend's eyes, hears it in his voice. \"Susan can be… headstrong. One day they punished her for disobedience.\" His voice is tight, his fists clenched tighter. \"They put us in adjoining cells, I couldn't get to her, and they used that sound on her, on and on and on ! They drove her into desonekarar, through the various stages and then stopped !\" Matt wants to say something, but against that tightly held fury he has no idea what. \"She could not achieve laaspaar and suffered nok 'desone. They kept her like that for four hours. For Four HOURS! She suffered constant seizures, cramps, agony none of your people have ever conceived, every part of her body ripped by torment! They kept her in agony , screaming, begging for mercy. She would have done anything to stop it - I would have done anything. For four hours I watched her suffer !\" His hand comes down, his fist slams into the machine beside him, driving a dent three inches deep into the metal corner and he doesn't seem to feel it. Matt thinks he'd best change the subject. \"What about … err …?\" He flounders, looking for a word, and since the subject is Susan it's even worse. He can barely bear the thought of that sweet woman suffering such intimate tortures. \"If I didn't satisfy Cathy, if say I couldn't… what about… errr…?\" \"Autoeroticism?\" George seems to pull himself out of the past outrage, but Matt knows him too well. The outrage is still there, only restrained. \"No, only full sexual intercourse with a male partner can carry the woman to the heights necessary for fulfillment and to prevent nok 'desone, the passion seizures. And complete fulfillment generally takes a long time to achieve.\" 'I'll say,' Matt thinks, remembering Cathy's staggering stamina. \"When do the seizures begin?\" x \"The cramps begin no more than a minute or so after the stimulation is prematurely aborted. You could not have missed it, therefore it did not happen. But once begun, they continue indefinitely until laaspaar is achieved.\" \"By a man. It's not fatal, is it?\" \"No, but many have wished it were, for it is relentless.\" George doesn't see why Matt dwells upon this painful and intrusive topic. He's spent all the time he cares to in discussing personal matters with the Human, friend or no. His concern had only been in preparing him for dealing with Cathy in this new phase in their relationship and he's done that. He turns to the door, just wants to leave. \"A woman driven to 'passion seizures' might do anything to stop them, wouldn't she?\" Matt's tone was quite speculative, but George sees nothing worth speculating on this topic. He really wants out of this room and off this subject. Part way to the door, he turns back, his voice strangled. \"She would wish to, but other than completed laaspaar with a man there is no hope of easing the seizures, no relief at all.\" \"A woman alone, no man around, might even be driven to, say, throw herself out a thirteenth story window?\"[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Robann George's expression reflects his horror at the realization. \"The whistle Frank and Rosalyn Martin spoke of.\" In hindsight it's horrendously clear what the sound, muffled through the intervening wall, had been; and it also explains why, after Victoria Seacret had thrown herself through the closed window to fall thirteen stories to her death, there had been no one seen leaving the apartment. Whoever had done this to Seacret, he'd been gone long before she died. \"Let's get down there.\" The Morgue is only a few floors below them, one level below the street, so the elevator deposits there outside the door in under a minute. Lois Allen looks up as they push the Suite doors open. \"Hi, gumshoes, what's the rush?\" \"We need a test on the fall victim, Victoria Seacret. She here?\" \"No one's claimed her yet.\" \"What did you find out about our perp?\" Matt asks, picking up a ring binder with a card bearing the victim's name inserted into the front slot. \"Definitely male.\" \"Thanks a bunch,\" he says, tossing aside the too-thick binder. \"Don't mention it,\" Lois advises, still deadpan. Then she becomes more serious. \"No sign of a struggle, no defensive wounds, no scratches, bruises, abrasions or injuries; nothing under her nails, between her teeth nor were there any injuries inconsistent with jumping naked through a glass window or from the very hard stop. No trace of venereal disease, HIV, nothing. I put the interval between sexual intercourse and death at thirty minutes to one hour.\" \"We need you to run some special tests.\" \"What's up?\" George explains briefly. \"Never heard of it.\" Of that he has no doubt. \"What do I test for?\" \"You look for–\" Suddenly George realizes he has absolutely no idea what to look for. A Tenctonese woman in the throes of the escalating arousal of desonekarar that will ultimately result in laaspaar, or suffering the horrendous tortures of nok 'desone, is unmistakable. But as to what is happening inside her body, chemically, hormonally or otherwise, he doesn't have a clue; especially in what to look for in a day-plus-old corpse. \"I've got it,\" Matt says, happy not only to contribute but more for an excuse to get some on-duty time in resolving a far more personal issue. \"Cathy's a bio-chemist, wouldn't she know?\" \"Yes.\" Has George seen through both layers of the intent? Probably. Who cares? \"I'll call her.\" He steps away from the pair, definitely needing privacy for this. x /Hello?/ He rushes as quickly as he can \"Cath it's Matt whatever you do please don't hang up.\" For a long moment he fears she has. No matter, he'll drive down to the Medical Center to see her. /I'm not hanging up, Matt,/ she finally says, her words more cautious than he's heard in a long time. \"We need to talk.\" /When you find the words for either of us, you'll be sure to tell me?/ \"I need to see you. Here.\" A long pause, heartbreakingly long. Finally /I don't know that that's appropriate./ \"I do. There are some things I need your help on.\" /What?/ Okay, maybe after last night she does have the right to sound suspicious. \"We have a Newcomer woman here who threw herself out a thirteen story window. George thinks she was suffering from something called…\" he can't get his tongue around it. \"knock desone.\" /What?/ \"Okay, I screwed that up royally. George says to tell you 'desone kar arr', 'la as par rar' and 'nk'desone'.\" /Matt…/ there's horrible apprehension to her voice, /I can't go there, but I need you and George to come here . Right now./ xxx It's because Cathy Frankel never demands nor imposes that Matt Sikes drops his investigation in the Autopsy Suite and twenty minutes later he and George arrive at the rendezvous site outside the Medical Center's third floor Isolation Ward. As they walk the last few meters to the large maroon double doors, Cathy steps out of a side room at the right to meet them. Under her white Medical smock she wears an equally white dress that closes at her neck and reaches past her knees. Tenctonese don't feel the heat the way humans do, but Matt wishes she'd make some concessions. Then again, she does - when off duty. She walks immediately to Matt, takes his arms in her hands and briefly touches her left temple to his. To George she presses the knuckles of her right hand to his temple and neither man can miss the distinction as George returns the gesture. \"Hi, Matt; Jabo, Stangya.\" \"Hi, Cathy,\" Matt says in a tone George finds distinctive. Rather than pausing, Matt grabs her arm and herds her back into the room from which she'd just come, realizing only too late that it's a rest room. A Women's rest room. \"Oh, boy.\" x Cathy's not altogether surprised that he hadn't noticed the universal sign outside; he does tend to miss some things when he lets himself get distracted, and his all-too-frequent air of complete discomfort makes it plain he wants - needs - to talk. So she gets a rein on the hundreds of things she wants to say and waits patiently for him to find the right words with which to begin, trusting in George to maintain their privacy. \"Cathy… George explained to me about … about the dezone carer, the lasparat and the pop-dizone.\" As so often happens when he tries to use Tenctonese words, she fights to keep from laughing. Nothing in this is funny. \"I, umm, I just – that is, I just wanted to say… that is, I wanted to….\" \"Don't worry, I'm fine .\" This time she does smile, quite broadly, and his world seems to switch on. \"In fact, it was marvelous .\" In fact, the instant she'd seen him outside, the serxi nerves that surround her vulva had given a mini-flare of delight – and anticipation. x \"It was? I mean, it was. Of course it was. But, er….\" He has that same expression she recognizes from whenever he wants to know something and doesn't really know how to ask. \"This dizzonekarar, I mean, what's it like? I mean….\" Her face changes to a mask of utter horror. \"Oh, it's terrible!\" she whispers. \"It's almost as bad as sardonac!\" For a moment he's utterly confused - sardonac is a love potion; if the Searchers sang of 'Love Potion Number 9', this is more like 9,000. It had caused him a vast number of uncomfortable moments on his first personal encounter with the amazing drug, but... She smiles, no longer wanting to tease him, and she puts her arms around him. \"It was wonderful.\" She wonders, however, if he's really getting all she's telling him. Well, he soon will. \"But you know; it's a funny thing.\" \"What?\" \"Well, it sort of tickled. A little.\" \"Huh?\" \"Well, I've never done it with anyone with hair.\" x She almost feels guilty; if he'd been off balance before, he's now toppled. \"Well, it's just that when I, that is, when I woke up you were gone. I thought things might be – and then I got to talking with George and he told me all those horrible things about nk-dizone and I remembered you were so scared when you said it and I didn't know what was going on and I was afraid you ran off thinking–\" \" Matt .\" \"Wha?\" She smiles; it's not usually so easy to break through to him. \"Everything's fine, it was wonderful and I really want to talk about it when we have five or six free hours and I'm not standing in a Ladies' Room.\" \"Well, er, yes, sure, I–\" He shuts himself up and opens the door for her. x When they step out, Matt quickly scans the hall, relieved to find no one waiting to use the room. Nevertheless, he checks to confirm this with George. \"A few women did want to use the facilities; I directed them to use another site.\" \"How?\" Cathy asks. \"I told them my partner Matthew was strip-searching a female suspect.\" Matt has a moment of heart-seizing panic, but he and George have exchanged many attempts at cross-species humor. \"Good one, George.\" \"So,\" Cathy asks with a tiny smile, \"did I enjoy it?\" George gives her that curious penguin arm movement that corresponds to a shrug. x Matt has had enough. \"Cathy, why did you want us to come down here?\" All her humor vanishes in an instant. \"It was something you said reminded me of one of our patients.\" She turns to the double doors of the Isolation Ward, pushes one open and leads them through. \"Yesterday an ambulance brought in a 17 year old Tenctonese woman named Cheshire Katt. Her family had returned home, found her in their apartment.\" She says nothing more as they traverse the short hall and enter the third door on their left. Inside, the young woman lies upon an upraised bed, she's apparently asleep, and lies under a one way opaque sheet pulled up to cover her chest. Her bare arms and shoulders are above the covering and her body is bathed in intense ultraviolet light. An older Tenctonese couple Matt assumes are her parents look up from the other side of the bed, their eyes filled with malevolent mistrust aimed directly at him. \"Manx and Ali Katt,\" Cathy says soothingly, \"these are Detectives George Francisco and Matthew Sikes, LAPD.\" \"Get out ,\" the man commands Matt. x \"Now, Mister...\" he's used to distrust or animosity, not such immediate and searing hatred. Katt ignores his wife's hand on his arm as much as he ignores Matt's effort to calm him and says to the room in general \"Get this tert away from our daughter or I won't be responsible for that happens to him.\" \"Matt, I think–\" \"Sure, George.\" He allows Cathy to escort him out. \"Mr. and Mrs. Katt, I'm sorry for your–\" He doesn't know what the man says, but the hatred needs no translation. Out in the hall, Cathy closes the door. \"I'm sorry, Matt, I wasn't expecting….\" \"Don't worry about it; he didn't even see me. What can you tell me?\" Cathy's grim manner is so far from her normal élan that she seems a different person. \"She was found yesterday in their apartment, suffering from nok 'desone. She was brought here, we stabilized her, resolved the problem…. A rape kit turned up human sperm in her. We sent it to the lab for DNA testing.\" \"Check with Lois Allen in our morgue, she's also running that test.\" \"I will.\" But one thing – two things actually – bother him. The Emergency Broadcast test had been yesterday evening, not afternoon; and George had said there was no cure for this problem but …. \"Cathy, did your people come up with a medical way to solve this, the 'passion seizures', some drug or therapy?\" \"No, Matt, why?\" \"Well, George tells me the only way to cure this desone thing is to reach laaspaar. How did–?\" Cathy gives him an eloquent look that says 'you haven't figured that out for yourself?' Matt has had enough of sounding like a naïve human. xx It's thirty minutes later, while Matt and Cathy have discussed many things, things that could be said only while doctors and nurses didn't pass back and forth, when George rejoins them. If Cathy had been grim earlier, George is even more so. \"What did they say?\" Matt asks. \"Little that can be repeated in front of a lady,\" he says with a nod to Cathy, one Matt recognizes to be unnecessary; the Tenctonese do not have the same 'chivalric' sense humans do. \"If you'll excuse me, I really have to get back to my department. I'll leave you two to discuss police work.\" \"We'll talk later?\" Matt asks. \"Count on it,\" she assures him with a private smile and walks down the corridor to the exit. George waits patiently for Matt to turn, keeping his face expressionless, knowing better than to think he'll have his partner's attention while the woman is in sight. When she's gone and Matt returns to the Sol system, he says: \"I spoke to Cheshire Katt.\" \"Does she remember what happened?\" \"She remembers everything. A human male of about twenty years met her at the Supermarket and offered to help her with her groceries. They returned together to the Katt apartment and when they were alone he attacked her. She refuses to tell me any of the details, but she is still traumatized, and having her parents present did not assist matters. It slowed things considerably in fact. I propose we send a policewoman from Sex Crimes and a sketch artist here after visiting hours.\" \"Hopefully that'll work. Meantime, we should see Hospital Security; have them post guards outside this room. If our man knows she survived – I'll bet a hundred dollars he's the one who made Victoria Seacret jump out her window – he might come back to finish the job. I'll call Grazer, get some female Newcomer officers over here.\" He's not concerned about this choice; female Tenctonese won't inspire the wrath of Manx Katt the way male humans would, and trained Officers are quite capable of handling a weaker human perp - assuming he's stupid enough to challenge them. And if he is ... well, they'll probably leave enough for the Coroner's Inquest. xxx It's nearly two hours later when, in the PD Commissary, they can finally grab a late lunch, but it seems an ordeal. Matt, usually very expressive, is wrapped in silent preoccupation while attacking his hero sandwich with what seems to George to be unnecessary violence. George, grateful he's finally managed to talk Captain Grazer into installing at least one out of four UV and florescent bulbs, rolls up his sleeves and contemplates his partner, wondering what observation or suggestion he can make that won't be greeted by anger. They're almost finished with lunch when two women, a plainclothes officer they recognize from the Sex Crimes Unit and a uniformed woman from the Evidence vaults enter, deep in conversation. This should be a perfect opportunity to enlist the aid of the former, as going through channels is slower than necessary. Matt, unlike George, has never mastered the concept of 'recourses unavailable at the present time' when a resource is standing seven feet away, and George considers this attitude to be a practical one indeed. This will, at least, give him the opportunity to, as Matt might say, pitch his ball. \"What gets me is that I don't think we have a chance,\" slim blonde Patty Johnson says as the women make their food selections. \"When did she come to you?\" Louise Fletcher, older and stockier, asks. \"Four days ago. She wanted to press charges, but I don't know. The Newcomer gave no ID for the guy, couldn't even come close to picking him out from Mugs. She admits to giving in but she claims involuntary coercion. Now normally that's great, I can make a case on that, but this time I don't have a thing to go on.\" She takes a tray but slaps it onto the counter. \"Defense would rip her story to bits; there's just no precedent to go into court claiming coercion by some high-tech, sci-fi 'horniness box'.\" George starts as Matt almost chokes on his sandwich, an explosive sound that makes the two women turn to them. Matt, still choking and coughing, is on his feet, forcing the words out. \" Horniness box ?\" \"Yes,\" Patty Johnson says when she's sure Matt won't choke to death. \"The victim, a Newcomer named Stephanie Atto, claimed the perp turned on this thing and a whistle got her so hot she couldn't stop him from fucking her.\" \" Four days ago?\" Matt demands so sharply the women draw away apprehensively. \"Yes.\" Matt turns on George, the pieces falling into place - too hard. \"George, the Martins said they heard what sounded like a whistle in Victoria Seacret's apartment before she died; the EB test last was last night but what happened to Cheshire Katt was in the afternoon. Stations don't do back-to-back tests so whatever happened to them wasn't what happened to Cathy. Those are short, this hadda be for a couple minutes.\" He turns to the women. \"Ladies, I think there is a horniness box like your victim described and it's tied in to a death we're working on.\" \"It's called a Robann,\" George says flatly. x Matt feels as though the air is yanked from his sails and he very slowly turns to his partner, wondering just when police work became so horrendous. \"You knew what it was?\" he demands incredulously. \"Not then, but I do now. I just hope I'm wrong.\" \"Huh?\" That word, Matt decides, is getting too much of a workout on this case and he's beginning to really hate it. \"The Kleezant sun , remember? That's what they used. I told you about it.\" Not exactly, but close enough; George'd told him about Susan. \"Oh. But what's a Human doing with it?\" Even as he asks, he knows the question is hopelessly rhetorical and waves it off. He turns to the women who still stare at him in what he supposes is certainty that he's either on to something or off his mind. Probably the latter. \"Can we talk to this woman?\" \"Sure. I guess so,\" she amends, mentally waving lunch goodbye. \"Any help you can give I'll appreciate; I'm way over my head with this sla – this Newcomer stuff.\" \"Fine, let's go. Time's a'wasting.\" \"Matt...\" It takes Sikes a moment to understand the significance of his partner's tone; he couples this realization with the woman's expression and the empty tray in her hand. \"I guess it can wait 'till after lunch.\" xxx Outside a huge A&P; Supermarket a Tenctonese woman, clad in backless halter and hot pants against the oppressive heat, struggles with two overloaded brown bags as she walks down the street. She doesn't notice the teenager she passes until he calls out to her: \"Can I give you a hand?\" She turns, and at that moment the overloaded paper bags start to slide in her grip. He's there immediately, catches them and takes one in his arms. \"Thank you; I can sure use the help.\" \"Glad to,\" he assures her, securing the bag in his right arm while his left hand goes to his jeans pocket, checking his toy.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven Gastrovere Stephanie Atto sits with her husband Marcus on the couch, not looking at Officer Patty Johnson, whom she's met twice already nor the other human, who she hasn't. She glances occasionally at George but mostly she sits tensely, huddled into the black dress that covers her from neck to floor. Her husband, a large Newcomer who looks the part of a typical lumberjack except that the nearest forest is nearly a hundred miles distant, sits with his arm about her shoulders. While not a small woman, Stephanie is dwarfed by his bulk, but much of that comes from her hunched over, pulled in posture. None of this scene was unexpected, even in that she pointedly tries to pretend neither human is present by initially speaking only in Tenctonese. Marcus Atto tried to convince her otherwise, but only wound up serving as interpreter in both directions, which significantly slowed things at first. It was only when her own impatience at not being clearly understood overwhelmed her that she started to open up. \"It happened four days ago,\" she admits for the fourth time, this time in English, knowing she has no choice but to begin the story again . \"He – I thought he was just going to help me with my groceries.\" She tells them of the suspect's having helped her carry packages into the apartment, but then he'd taken something from his pocket and turned it on. \"I tried to resist . I knew what he was doing but I tried to resist. I really tried . I did . I DID!\" \"We know,\" George assures her. \"He left her in nok 'desone!\" Marcus exclaims furiously. \"I came home from work over an hour later and found her on the floor .\" \"I understand,\" George tells them. Up to this point Marcus Atto had tried to hold his feelings in check but they boil over, and Patty Johnson and Matt Sikes are quickly lost in a rapid three way barrage of Tenctonese, during which Matt can only catch such words as 'Kleezant sun ', 'robann' and 'gastrovere'. The last is a word Matt knows and hoped he wouldn't hear. It refers to a 'vengeance war' in which all other concerns are secondary; it's the ultimate satisfaction of a grievance. Worse than a blood feud, worse than a riot, it always ends only in savage death, usually for a great many people. Matt hears George fight hard for conciliation and hopes he'll win. Not a prayerful man, Matt prays then. If this is as widespread as he fears, or becomes generally known, a gastrovere may be the result and the number, and variety, of casualties will be staggering. The vengeance that arises from that will cause wave upon wave of reciprocal violence that will rip both human and Tenctonese society in Los Angeles apart and tears will flow as heavily as blood on both sides. Gradually George wins a grudging compromise: a gastrovere will not be called - yet. But Marcus Atto's parting words, clearly intended to be understood by all, are chilling: \"Catch this tert. Catch him now or we will.\" \"We will, I promise. Mrs. Atto, nok'posa. Kesa masvant nelon. (I'm sorry. We'll do all we can.)\" \"Naka tam.\" (Thank you.) x Outside and approaching their cars, George resembles a man who has averted disaster by the slimmest of margins. \"So, George, what do you make of our pervert with the horniness box?\" George turns a pained expression to his partner. \"Matthew, I wish you would not refer to it as a 'horniness box', or any other euphemism for that matter. It trivializes, or even worse excuses, what has for generations been a terror and torture device against our women and those that love them. It works relentlessly against the nervous system and it is completely irresistible. The women must eventually give in, and still risk nok'desone or possibly even Victoria Seacret's fate.\" \"Okay, okay, I read you; we've gotta get this guy, but we still don't have much of a lead. A male tert with brown hair isn't going to get us out of the batter's box. We've gotta get better descriptions; after that sketch artist is done with Katt we've gotta get her to Atto, get something we can distribute.\" \"And head off gastrovere,\" George concurs ominously. \"Why?\" Johnson demands, fed up with being left behind by the pair. \"What the hell is gastrovere?\" \"Armageddon, lady. And so far we don't have a clue as to how to stop it.\" \"Maybe we do,\" George says meaningfully, pointing to the street sign on the corner. It takes only a moment for Matt to realize the significance of the sign, and when he does he wants to kick himself. \"We're about a mile and a half from Seacret's place and Katt and Atto were both met by someone while carrying groceries. Time to pay another call on Erika McGiver.\" He turns to Patty Johnson. \"Can you get back to the station, pull everything on perps that gain admittance by helping people with packages?\" \"Will do.\" x In their car, wiping perspiration from his forehead that this time doesn't have much to do with the oppressive heat, the first thing Matt wants to know is: \"George, how long have your people known about that Emergency Alert noise?\" \"I heard rumors it was from before the descent. Our ship was monitoring your communications and there's a rumor that your E.A. signal to your people actually caused the Gruza to crash.\" Matt looks sharply at him, his surprise vast. He'd often wondered just what it was that had caused the 'unexplained' crash. \"If so, it was a very effective weapon.\" \"I'll say.\" Matt pulls his attention back to his driving. \"But after you were down, and out of Quarantine, didn't any of you guys go to the F.C.C.?\" \"How could we? Tell your government what, that your system works very well against alien vessels that might attack your planet, and would you please stop using it?\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"While the test is a considerable inconvenience, we generally get plenty of warning, the same warning you do, several seconds in which to either turn it off or let it alone to do its thing.\" Matt glances at him, decides not to grin, just to keep his eyes on the road as they swerve around more slowly moving traffic. \"We are not that heavily integrated into your world, and the chance of having a Human present when we cannot prevent the sound from affecting us is remote. Even Cathy, in the two occasions she was 'caught short' in your apartment, was not driven to a loss of control and would not have been yesterday if not for your actions. The best, or worst if you wish, one has to contend with is erotic stimulation. In cases like Suse and myself, it is an unexpected bonus to married couples; in your case, well, Cathy was favorably disposed toward you to begin with and would have had the option of choosing how to act.\" \"If I hadn't–\" \"Matt, what happened last night cannot be categorized as 'rape'.\" \"You're lying, George. Know how I can tell? Your forehead gets pinker.\" \"Well … be that as it may, when we saw Cathy she did not press charges so I presume you two are going to work last night out like two rational adults. Or rather one rational adult and one human.\" \"Thanks, George.\" \"But the fact is, if we had come out and revealed what we knew to your government, you can see the potential for disaster.\" x Matt and George hadn't met until five years after First Contact, and the first months of learning about one another and trying to integrate as partners hadn't been smooth. They'd had their share of misunderstandings, mistrust and outright fights - but their interaction had gone far better than had the previous five years of friction between Newcomers and the more militant of Purists. \"No one trusted the other side,\" George stresses. \"Even now there's not a lot of trust among some. Most humans do not know us as you do. Revealing this weakness might well have led to unrestrained private use instead of this one case, and rapes of Newcomer women would have been rampant and constant – and gastrovere wouldn't be a threat now but a sad history, possibly with Los Angeles being reduced to a ghost town.\" \"You're a cheerful guy, George. But what about this thing we're dealing with?\" \"A robann. The Kleezant sun used them, as you know. There weren't many, and we'd hoped they were destroyed or lost in the crash, because when we did finally get out of Quarantine and our Elders returned to what was left of the ship the robanns were one of the things that could not be found.\" \"Pretty dense, George. Dense, wishful and stupid .\" \"I know,\" he admits dismally. \"I knew about them, but those of us who knew were obliged to secrecy. I had little choi–\" Matt veers to the right, stomps on the brakes so hard George is almost flung into the dashboard. Several horns blast but Matt ignores them as much as the shouts of passing motorists. \"Listen, George, I am fed up with these secrets, with finding out things by accident or too late! I've had this out with you more than once and I want this to be the last time! I'm your partner – and if you had come to me before with this problem–\" \"You would have made a lot of stupid jokes!\" \"Only at first! Damn it , George, you knew these things existed; we could've done something about them! You know that! You kept faith with your people, what if those women hadn't been strangers? What if you'd kept your mouth shut and it'd been Susan? Or maybe they turn up fifteen years from now and it's Emily? Or Vessna ?\"[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight Laaspaar \"Yes, the groceries were here when I got in, three big bags on the table,\" Erika McGiver tells them, pointing to the square butcher block table near the kitchenette. \"You didn't mention them yesterday,\" Matt says, unable to mask his aggravation. \"I didn't think they were important.\" \"In a Police Investigation, everything's important. Where the–\" He forces himself to stop, to take a mental step away. \"Where did they come from?\" \"A & P over on 9th between Kraus and Jackson.\" \"Why that particular store?\" George asks. He's seen numerous grocers serving Tenctonese food within blocks of this building. Newcomers can eat vegetables with no problems, but they cannot digest cooked meats, though in general they can obtain food at any place that sells uncooked foodstuffs. Granted there are special types that Newcomers favor, such as weasel, beaver, muskrat and organs like spleen or pancreas, as well as mollusks and certain species of insects, but …. \"That was the first big store to offer lines of human and Tenctonese food. For us, it's one stop shopping and they're big enough to under-price the specialty shops. But what does this have to do with Vicky?\" \"We think,\" George tells her, \"that someone followed her home, perhaps helped to carry the groceries. We think that person raped her, left … and then Miss Seacret killed herself.\" \"NO!\" she insists. \"No matter what happened, I told you - Vicky would not kill herself!\" \"You told us you teach Tenctonese language and culture to humans,\" George continues. \"Yes.\" \"Who taught you?\" \"Well, what we didn't learn in College Vicky and I sort of tutored each other.\" \"Have you ever heard of nok 'desone?\" She thinks about it, and George isn't surprised by her answer. \"No. What is it?\" Before he can answer, Matt does. \"A reason to kill herself.\" xxx 'Maybe there is something to working in your own neighborhood,' Matt thinks as they leave the building. 'Sorry, Bryon.' He'd been so angry with the Captain for what he'd seen as a capricious decision that he hadn't considered the possible benefits of a cop working where his face is known. That particular Supermarket, well able to claim the designation 'super' by virtue of being almost a square block in size, is within three blocks of his apartment house and within a mile and a half radius of Seacret, Atto and Katt. \"Some teachers,\" he gripes. \"Seacret didn't tell her own partner the good stuff.\" \"I'm well aware that on your world the lascivious and the carnal are usually among the earliest things taught, but you understand Victoria Seacret's need for discretion.\" \"I got your discretion. You guys keep so many secrets it's a wonder we ever communicate.\" \"It does make for some challenging conversations. But what are we going to do about this supermarket?\" \"We're going to have to stake that place out,\" Matt declares. That'll be the only way they can expect to find a white human with brown hair with a penchant for being a 'Good Samaritan' by carrying the bags of solitary Newcomer women. \"We'd better use my car then,\" George advises. \"Yours is too well known.\" \"No kidding. I'm three frigging blocks away.\" xx Bryon Grazer is no more enamored of the idea of two of his detectives staking out a supermarket until further notice than either of them expected, but his interest is in the expense of inactivity. His contention that two detectives sitting in one place isn't economically feasible is countered by Sikes' that this way the perp will walk into their hands. Grazer isn't as optimistic, but as he expresses to George \"if I don't say 'do it', I know Sikes will do it anyway. At least, with you there, you can keep him in line.\" \"I'll do my best,\" George assures him solemnly. George might have hesitated in going along with Matt's plan, continuous stakeouts of the spot, until he recalls that Susan does occasionally drive across town to 'the market', and he's realized, with a sudden chill, that he had never been entirely clear on just where this market was. xxx The Tenctown A&P;, though in reality it's nowhere near the ghetto known as 'Little Tenctown', has expanded many times in recent years. Open 24 hours, it's generally crowded in the evenings, and more so on Friday nights. This is yet another hectic Friday and Cathy Frankel could have, to use a human term, kicked herself for forgetting it. She had intended to simply walk over the three blocks for a few items and yet, completely preoccupied with thoughts of last evening with Matt, her thoughts on preparing a special meal he could not possibly say 'no' to coming over for, she'd paid little attention to the volume of her purchases. It was only when she'd emptied her shopping cart into four large paper bags that she'd realized she had no easy way of getting them home. Gathering the bags, depending upon Tenctonese strength to make it, she struggles out of the store and into the cooling evening. Already the huge bags threaten to slip from her arms and she prays she can make it home before one - or more - of them split. \"Can I give you a hand, miss?\" says a voice from behind her. She turns, all but losing one of the bulky bags which is caught by a young man with short brown hair. \"Oh, could you? I'm really stacked.\" He grins. \"Yes, I can see that,\" he says, taking a second bag from her. xx A quick trip home with Matt to switch cars turns out to be no such thing when Susan hears their plan. \"Must you go out tonight , Nemu?\" The wistful tone makes him pause. \"Why?\" But she seems more distressed that he has to ask. \"We have tickets for Tchaikovsky, remember?\" Now he does. She'd reminded him this morning and had done so every evening this week. \"I'm sorry, Suse. But you can still go.\" \"No. It's no fun without you,\" she says morosely. \"Ah, George….\" Reluctant as Matt is to step into domestic issues, he feels guilty at instigating this plan. Not consulting Grazer ahead of time is one thing, not consulting Susan is something else entirely. \"A stakeout – well, who knows how long these things last. Coupla days. Who's to say we'll hit paydirt in the first 4 hours? Why don't you drop me off at home, I'll change and get down there and I'll meet you later.\" \"Well, if you're sure.\" But they can see Susan is even more touched. \"Hey, what's a Godfather for?\" xx With the generous stranger's help Cathy makes it home, up the elevator and down the short hall to where it turns right, directly to 204, but then she pauses. \"Listen, I really want to thank you for this. I couldn't have made it without you.\" \"Hey, no problem.\" He makes no move to give back either bag. \"I'd invite you in, but the apartment's really a mess.\" The apartment is as immaculate in anticipation of company, but she doesn't want to let him know that. Having someone over other than her planned guest is not conducive to a pleasant evening. \"That's all right; I really want to just put these down.\" She reconsiders, courtesy overcoming apprehension. After all, what does she have to be apprehensive about? He seems like a gentleman, maybe she's just overreacting. 'The incident with Katt probably just spooked me worse than I thought,' she decides. \"Okay.\" She hands him a third bag so she can get to her keys and unlocks the door, takes the bag and precedes him into the apartment and goes into the kitchen. She doesn't see him quietly ease the deadbolt closed. \"Do you live around here?\" she asks as she returns to take the other bags from him. \"No, I just come out here for my entertainment.\" \"Oh? What sort of entertainment is that?\" Hands freed, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a white rectangular device. A piercing tone fills the air and Cathy starts, dropping the heavy bags. Horrified, she turns, clamps her hands over her ear valleys, knowing it's a useless gesture. \"Neee (No) Not again!\" x She feels the effect instantly overcome her as the noise strokes every nerve with sensual delight, igniting her most private passions. It's just like the last time, but so unlike. In cold panic she uncovers her ears and lunges desperately for the device but he's ready, shoves her back and she staggers into the living room, barely able to keep her feet. She covers her ears again, but the sound works on her whole body and deafness wouldn't help her. 'Sela! Nas'pon ducliz-za' (Please! Not after last night!) The chord rips thorough her body, strokes every nerve with the most erotic sensations. It plays along the sensitive speckles that taper down her back, across the serxi cluster of nerves between her legs, tingle at her labia and stroke phantom touches along the backs of her knees, lick at her nipples, tickle her shoulder blades. She gasps, moaning as the sound caresses her, igniting passion, firing lust she can't fight. \"Sela nee!\" (Please - no!) Last night was wonderful – this is rape ! x He advances confidently on her and the closer he comes, the more intently the sound attacks her. Already the passion flares in her. The muscles about her sulyas twinge and she feels the canal leading upward with it grow moist in anticipation – and she can't fight it. She tries to back away. The sound is magnified by touch, by the vibrations against her skin will destroy all hope of resistance. Her body grows torrid, her vulva tingles, her labia grow moist from the discharge flowing down her canal and her breasts grow more sensitive by the second as the speckles on her back itch to be touched. It feels like someone's making mad, passionate love to every inch of her body, within and without, and the tert's still feet away! 'No! Keep away!' she tries to say, but every breath is a moan of searing passion. It's worse than last night. By this point she'd already had her arms about Matt – but it was Matt, not this sleema tert ! The smiling monster is only inches away. She wants to run, to hide, to escape that damned sound ! 'Keep away! Don't touch me!' she screams within but can't say it. Her words are lost in the blasts of sensual sensation that overcome her. His hand reaches out and gently squeezes her breast and time explodes with desire. His touch is worse than the noise, just as Matt's had been better. She tries to push his hand from her breast and searing bolts of lust blast her body. He tweaks her nipple and she wants to shriek as her body flares in sensual delight! xx \"I don't know, George, I can just feel it in my bones,\" Matt insists as he pushes open the door to the stairwell on the second floor. It's faster to take the stairs when he has this much nervous energy and tonight he feels he's right, that they're going to catch this bastard. It doesn't hurt either that this door puts them right beside apartment 204 and he'd run into his neighbor by 'accident' yesterday. Well, small disappointment that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. \"If we can just pin this guy down, get something more on his methods, we can–\" George's vice-like grip on his arm silences him. \" Shush ! Matt, listen!\" The faint tone filtering through the door is unmistakable. \"Cathy!\" Matt pounds hard on the wood. \"Cathy, you in there? What the Hell is happening in there? CATHY !\" x The urgent pounding, the frantic voice break through Cathy's fever and even as the tert reaches for her she draws a deep breath and shrieks. \" MAAAAAAAAAT !\" x They draw their guns, Matt sets himself and kicks the door as hard as he can but it holds steady. He's about to try again when George pulls him away, takes his place and kicks with force his enraged partner could never hope to match. The door explodes inward, the lock breaks off and they charge in, only to halt immediately at the sight of Cathy being held before them, their quarry using her as a human shield, one arm about her throat, the other hand pressed hard into her lower back, pressing her forward. The relentless sound of the robann fills the air and Cathy, choked by the arm across her throat, is completely overcome, her body writhing in lustful abandon. \"LET HER GO !\" Matt yells, sighting his gun on the bastard's head. One clear shot and– \"Let her go and turn that damned noise off !\" \"No! I'm walking out of here and you'll let me go,\" he shoves harder into Cathy's lower back and she cries out in distressed lust, \"or I'll blow this slag all over you!\" She's groaning unintelligibly, panting lustfully, driven nearly out of her mind. Her face reflects terror, but more lust than fear. She's losing this standoff. With a convulsive gesture Matt puts up his gun, eases the cocked hammer down and George does the same. \"Okay, punk, you walk but let her alone!\" Again he forces his gun hand into Cathy's back and she cries out. It's not a cry of pain. \"Drop em!\" Both guns clatter to the floor and the men reluctantly move away from the door. Slowly he forces her forward. Her eyes sparkle with compelled passion as he presses her around them and retreats to the door. \"HERE!\" He shoves her at them and Cathy shrieks as she's shoved in the nerve center of her lower back, but both detectives catch her between them. x George relinquishes her to Matt. \"I'll get him!' He snatches up his gun and runs out the door, turns right through the closing Emergency door, leaving Cathy lying gasping in Matt's arms, her body burning. He's very cautious in how and where he touches her as he lowers her carefully to the couch. Her breathing is already slowing and he kneels beside her, heart in his throat. \"Cath? Jelana ?\" \"I'm – okay, Matt. Thank you. But sela– please, get him!\" Consumed with fiery rage, Matt snatches up his gun and charges out the door. Cathy, shaken, can't believe her fortune. She thanks all the gods of Tencton that he'd been there. She'd been driven so hard, pushed further than she'd ever imagined, faced her worst fear, but she's okay. She's actually going to be okay. She stands up carefully, trembling, starts for the open door – and doubles over from the pain that stabs her. Her abdomen spasms, ripping the breath from her. She fights herself upright, gasping in panic, clutching herself. \"No. Please n–\" The seizure rips through her body and she crashes to her knees. \"No! Sela !\" Every organ, every cell in her body is ripped apart and she shrieks, slams to the floor. xx Panicked, he runs out of the building and rushes wildly down the street, the slag in pursuit only seconds behind him. He'd never known capture to be so close, and after all his easy victories. Damned slag ! Damned spongehead slag , why'd he have to come home just then? Husband, boyfriend, whatever – he's a slag with a gun ! He's gaining. Rumors of slag speed, strength – and retribution – drive him even faster, yet there are no alleys, no hiding places, nothing but straight streets and a vengeful slag gaining on him! One more corner coming up. But – no ! A car's pulling in front of him and, inside, two slags, cutting him off! He turns right and the other guy, the longhair with the slag, crashes into him! x Matt body slams the perp so hard they leave the ground and Matt lands upon him before George can reach the pair, but he stops, standing over them as Matt, kneeling on their breathless quarry, gets his cuffs tight around the perp's wrists and for the first time George decides to take his time remembering the printed procedures and regulations published in the most recent rule book – or was it the issue before last? Matt hauls the man to his feet and slams him against the brick wall so hard George considers the philosophical issue of whether or not the man's future children will actually feel the impact. He'll take a minute to contemplate this. \"You're under arrest for rape, attempted rape and manslaughter!\" Matt announces, wishing he could make it murder. His forearm pins the man's throat to the wall and George considers the compression rate of human flesh and how long it might take to– \"I didn't kill anyone!\" Matt searches the pockets of the motionless man, pulls the robann from his pocket and holds it an inch from his face. \"Where'd you get this?\" he comes close to shouting the question. \"I don't kno–\" is as far as he gets. Matt leans heavily on his throat. \" Try again !\" \"Some slag!\" he gasps when Matt eases his pressure. \"Some slag, I don't know who.\" \"A Newcomer gave you this to use against Newcomers?\" 'If this bastard's lying….' \"He sold it to me for $500. Said it could turn on any slag bitch - easy.\" Matt yanks him from the wall, slams him again and again. \"That * 'slag * bitch' * is * my –\" \"Matthew!\" George gets in, grabs his arms, pulls him off. Dazed, nearly unconscious, his opponent slides to the cement. \"It's over. We got him.\" Still Matt struggles to reach him. \"It's over !\" Matt stops fighting and George releases him, reaches for the radio still attached to his belt as Matt searches the dazed man. \"This is 1 William 1 5 2.\" He gives Central Dispatch their location. \"We have one under, need backup for transportation.\" \"1 Willia Roger. I show 2 Ech near your location….\" The woman's voice goes on to relay and coordinate information between the units, but neither man pays attention. x Matt has finished searching the slowly recovering captive. \"No gun,\" he holds up a rectangular white box, about the size of a television remote control. \"He bluffed us with this. Your damned robann.\" \"Matthew, that is not a robann.\" The words cut through his rage. \"Whaddaya mean 'not a robann'?\" George takes the device; it takes only an instant of handling it to be sure. The casing is plastic, not any Tencton alloy he's ever seen, certainly not what he'd expected. \"It only functions like one, but this is not from the ship. It is of Earth manufacture. \"You mean we're dealing with these things mass produced ?\" \"Yes.\" But then an equally horrible thought breaks through. \"Matt, what are you doing here? You should be with Cathy. She needs you.\" \"I used the rear door. I knew most people would run out the front and try to duck out in this direction. She said she was all right.\" \"She can't be!\" The world seems to stop at George's tone. \"Oh my God.\" xx Cathy Frankel writhes on her living room floor, weeping in agony at the unending torment, unable even to scream. Wave after wave of searing pain wracks her body with merciless anguish. She can't breathe as the spasms batter her, tear her organs apart, rip her flesh from her bones. She weeps, knowing relief will never come. She'd thought in the first moments about what Cheshire Katt must have endured, now she knows all too well as her body is blasted again by the torturous cramps, the pain ripping her body apart. She'd tried to stand only once and had crashed over the coffee table. It's an eternity of pain when, over her sobbing, she hears the sound of rushing feet pull to a stop outside her door. \"Cathy!\" Matt's voice calls from the other end of agony. She forces her eyes open past a haze of tears to see him rush to her. He kneels, gathers her up in his arms. \"Matt – please – help me !\" She screams as another blast convulses her. She's laying half on his lap and he's caressing her face, trying to hold her and it's not helping. \"Whaddo I do?\" \"You–\" she gasps and her chest is ripped open, a huge sword stabs deep between her legs and she shrieks, bucking in his arms. He tries to hold her, to keep her from hurting herself as the scream ends in shattered sobs. He's stroking her arms, her face, touching her temples, the center of Tenctonese love and nothing's helping. His hands are almost close to her temples and she sobs when he moves them. \"Matt, you–\" an explosion of pain nearly sends her twisting out of his arms. He tries to hold her secure and her scream is more crying than yell. \"Cath, I don't know what to do !\" She tries to reach for his hands and another seizure rips through her. She clutches her stomach and chest and can't hold back wracking sobs. x \"Gently caress her temples,\" a calm voice beside them says. She forces her eyes open to see George unfocused through the haze of her tears. Matt's fingertips slowly, gently stroke her in calming, small circles. He keeps it up and the next wave of pain is less devastating. \"The bridge of her nose, up and down strokes with your fingers, but don't stop the touch to her temples.\" The pain is still there, sharp but no longer agonizing. In fact, she starts to feel better. George is beside them, his fingers stroking counter-clockwise in small circles behind and below her ear valleys and the pain gradually fades as her endorphins are stimulated. For about a minute the men work together and the pain steadily diminishes. \"Replace my hands with yours,\" Matt does so, continuing the soothing stroking, \"lean down close, face beside hers and hum.\" \" Hum ?\" \"A mellow tone. Do it.\" Matt does and she can reach, with only slight discomfort, to his head, her fingers through his hair and her own hum setting a melodious chord with his. \"Now remember, Matt, the shoulder blades, hum up and down her back speckles, all the way. Spend plenty of time. Don't neglect her temples … or the small of her back … or the backs of her knees. Take plenty of time...\" he's drawing away from them, growing distant. \"And I'll see you in the morning.\"[Chapter 9] Epilogue The chime of a telephone directly over his head wakes Matt with the realization that he doesn't have a telephone on his headboard. Movement beside him, the rustle of flesh against sheets reminds him of yesterday even before the ringing stops and Cathy's melodious voice asks \"Jabo?\" A moment's pause. \"Hi, Stangya. He's right here.\" Matt gets his eyes open but the only thing he sees is his lovely companion. He's never seen anyone look so good in the morning, especially after the vigorous night just passed, but he accepts the phone from her, wondering what the appropriate early-dawn etiquette for this situation is. He doesn't care, he has his own ideas and they don't involve talking on the telephone. \"Hello, George.\" He's not too surprised at his friend's timing; and his partner is the only one who could possibly have known to reach him here. He is mildly disturbed about being disturbed so early – at all, in fact. \"Good afternoon, Matt.\" The greeting dispels the tiredness from his mind. He looks at his wristwatch: 1:47. Naturally it wouldn't be this bright this early in the morning. \"I thought, though you called in sick this morning, that you'd like to hear the preliminary report on that kid. It was, after all, your collar.\" \"That wasn't necessary, George.\" But it is appreciated. His partner covered for him. \"'Hey, what's a Godfather for'?\" \"Thanks. Shoot.\" There's a pause. \"The report?\" \"No. Him !\" \"All right. The device we thought would be a robann was purchased from an 'unidentified' Tenctonese male for $500. Though the description could fit any non-female Newcomer, it did include the mention of a tattoo in our language about the wrist.\" \"Kleezantsun.\" He's never been able to reproduce that popping sound, but this word doesn't need it – any more than 'Nazi' would. \"It was only one of several offered for sale.\" Cathy, able to hear every word, sits upright so fast the blanket flies from her. Terror is etched on her face and Matt's reply is enough the sear the wires all the way to the station. He reaches for her; her shoulder is cold and he wonders if he should give in to his initial response and try to kiss her. Tenctonese don't kiss, though Cathy has adapted, but he doubts that it'll make her feel better. He wonders if anything can now. x Best to concentrate on business, grim though that is, and then on the woman beside him. 'God, she's beautiful in the morning, and very good for the afternoon.' \"The Overseers are trying to disrupt your people by giving punks like that bastard the way to rape and torture at will – and the Newcomers can't go to the authorities without fearing an epidemic.\" \"That is almost exactly what the Department has concluded. Sergeant Dobson and I are confident our perp knows where the Kleezant sun can be found.\" \"Good. We'll go in there with guns blazing.\" \"I'll call you when something breaks. Until then, stay with Cathy. There may be… aftereffects.\" Seeing the haunted look in the woman's eyes, Matt knows exactly what aftereffects George refers to. He reaches up and hangs up the phone, then puts his arm around Cathy's bare shoulders. He draws her close, her head to his chest, his hand petting her temple. She gently strokes the crisscrossing scratches she'd inflicted on his chest and stomach the previous evening, intending to ease any lingering pain as he'd done for her. It only sharpens it, makes him feel more alert, more…. After a few moments the tension in her seems to fade, and he gradually draws her down with him and closer, turns her to him, his hand stroking along her back, from neck to about where he thinks her spots end. He means the touch to be comforting, but if it can be distracting as well he won't mind. Her bare breasts against him certainly are. Yesterday morning had ended abruptly. Too often there's been too much left unsaid between them. This time there aren't going to be any things left unsaid between them, no more misunderstandings or uncertainties. \"Jelana?\" \"Yes, Matt?\" End. ","Summary":" Back in 1990, while Alien Nation starring Gary Graham and Eric Pierpoint was in its first run, I wa"},{"Movie":"Longest Yard","Title":"Mismatched","Author":"Heart of a Dixon","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8071523","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I took a deep breath. C'mon, Kai, you can do this. You've got this handled. Its just a bunch of prison inmates. I was shoved further along by one of the two guards behind me. Captain Asshat in front of me strutted along, preening like a peacock at the newest addition to the prison that he had caught in the act of theft. Which is actually a debatable charge. I hadn't actually been the one to steal anything. I was just the one who got caught standing nearby. My luck was just shitty enough that out of all of our friends that had been standing around, I had been the one that got targeted for the robber to slip his ill-gotten goods into my bag when no one was watching. So here I was in Allenville penitentiary. I ignored the stares of the other inmates (all males). I was the only woman here, due to some kind of a mix-up with my charge papers that I had a feeling had something to do with the little joke I told the judge about his mom half way through my trial. I tried to keep my gaze ahead, but just before we reached the doors of the main building of the pen, I looked off to the right. There was a large group of negro men watching me. There were maybe 15 of them, all stopping their weight-lifting to watch me pass by. A couple of them stuck out for some reason or another. One was a rather large, bulkily built man with his shirt off and sweat beading down his dark, toned skin in his left hand he was holding what looked like a cheeseburger from McDonalds. My stomach grumbled at the thought and I internally pouted. But that was ridiculous. How on earth would he have gotten that in here? Another was an even large man who looked just like a giant kid, excited glee in his eyes upon seeing the new inmate. But the last one intrigued me the most. Maybe it was the way he watched me, the way that was so different than the rest, or maybe the ease with which he held himself, or just maybe his eyes that were possibly the deepest shade of brown I thought I had ever seen. He had on a white tank top and a pair of jeans as well as a bandana tied tightly around his head, much like the one around mine, except mine had skulls residing beside the spaded pattern of the black cloth. His muscles were obvious even through his tank and his mouth was slightly open, his tongue rolling around near his teeth, adjusting the toothpick sticking out of it. But he wasn't watching me like I was the first woman he had seen in a long time and he couldn't wait to make a pass at me like the rest of them (excluding the big kid). He was watching me like a normal person, like a nice person. His face was mostly blank, but his eyes revealed everything. It felt like time stopped when I looked in his eyes, I seemed to stand there inspecting him for an hour or more. He blinked twice and lifted a hand to give a small wave of acknowledgement. I tilted my head forward a bit, the tiniest beginnings of a smile on the corner of my lips. I didn't wave back because the guards behind me would find some way for that to be me trying to escape. We stepped into the cool building and out of the hot Texas sun. We traveled down a few tiled halls before coming to an office whose door was closed. Captain Knauer knocked on the door and sent the other two guards away. \"Now, if Warden Hazen asks you a question, you respond with-?\" he asked, not turning around to face me. I squinted at a corner of the door. \"I'm assuming it's a yes-no question?\" He gave a sad sigh and spun around, snapping a quick punch to my gut. I let out a gust of air and spat onto the ground, gasping for air as I rolled onto my side, my hands still cuffed behind my back. \"Fuckin' asshole,\" I sputtered, still trying to regain my breath. He grabbed my shit sleeve and hauled me up. Before I could stand all the way up, he kicked my left leg out from under me and I fell backward, hitting the back of my head on the tile. \"You're lucky my hands are cuffed you son of a bitch!\" I yelled, not sure if my words came out coherent or not. \"Knauer, get that inmate in here and stop toying with her,\" came the voice of another man. I opened my eyes and looked up to see what must have been Warden Hazen standing in the doorway to his office. From beside him, another inmate walked out, led by a guard. But wait… I've seen this guy before. Oh my shit! That is Paul Crewe! Maybe I had hit my head harder than I thought. My eyes widened and Paul looked down at me. \"I see you already got a little taste of Knauer Knuckle?\" I nodded, dazed. \"Move along,\" the guard behind Crewe commanded firmly. Crewe cast an annoyed glance back at the guard before saying to me, \"Good luck.\" I nodded and then was pulled to my feet by Knauer as Paul Crewe was led down the hall to the cells. I tried to pay attention to what the warden was telling me, but after the beating I took outside, most of it was a macaronic jumble. I figured I would be fine without the basic guidelines being droned at me; it was probably all common sense stuff anyway. After my meeting with the warden, I was escorted by a different guard (one more passive and less violent than Knauer) to my cell. Second floor, number 257. \"We've renovated the room so that you can use the facilities without the prying eyes of your peers.\" Well that's a nice way of saying I can pee without creepers watching. I nodded and allowed him to uncuff me before he locked me into my cell. I gazed around. Well, for now, this was home. So guys, should I continue? :) Review and lemme know![Chapter 2] AUTHOR'S NOTE: I'm sorry guys, but I might have to postpone the continuance of this particular fanfic. I don't have anywhere to watch the movie to make sure I am getting this whole thing right, and I really should concentrate on my other fics. I have a terrible habit of starting new stories while I'm in the middle of one already, so I have accumulated quite a few. For those of you who read my stories, thank you for bearing with that habit. :) -Ash[Chapter 3] Walking through that cafeteria was an experience like no other. Hungry stares followed me, though no hands shot out to accompany them (thank God). I stayed silent, never getting too close to anyone, never making eye contact with anyone. I kept my head down and my speed up. After the men in hair nets behind the buffet glass served me up a nice tray of sludge, I began making my way toward the back wall, away from the tables, where I planned on sitting on the ground and brooding (not eating). When I was in the line, I had heard plenty of the men calling out jokes to Paul Crew, who had been just a few people in front of me in the line. I frowned. He seemed like a nice guy. Nice guys didn't last in prison. But neither did girls. I pushed the thought from my mind and continued walking. Before I made it halfway to my wall, my one last beacon of solitude in this noisy, hot, cramped hell, what I had been anticipating happened. A hand shot out from the guys seated at the bench/tables and grabbed my arm. My head snapped up, my body tensed. I had been preparing to drop my tray and attempt to fight for my life with what few skills I had, but the owner of the hand came as enough of a surprise to stop me mid-step. \"They don't like me much, they like you too much apparently, so why don't you sit over here.\" Paul Crew gestured to the seat next to the black man across from him. The man gave me a pleasant smile. \"Nice to see someone of the opposite sex.\" I could tell he was joking, by the light in his eyes. \"The name's Caretaker.\" I silently sat down beside him, wary despite his friendliness. I shook his offered hand. \"Kai Robinson.\" Caretaker continued, informing us of the many perks of his friendship. \"Whatever your pleasure,\" he whispered. \"I can facilitate. You need weed, you need meth, hey, you need prozac, I'm your man.\" He looked up at Paul. \"I know how you white boys always deal with that depression. I mean, me, personally, I don't get what you white boys are all depressed about. Hey, you're white! Smile! And for a small fee, I can even get you McDonald's.\" \"So I wasn't crazy,\" I mumbled to myself. \"Really?\" Paul asked. Caretaker nodded. \"Yeah, that's right, Mickie D's. My man Cheeseburger Eddy's got the hookup.\" He pointed down the table to the large man I had seen in that weight-lifting group outside. The huge one with muscles bigger than my face. The one that kind of scared me. I searched around him for the boy I had seen with him earlier, but saw no sign of him. Oh well. \"Cheeseburger Eddy?\" Paul asked. Caretaker gave him a carefree smile. \"That's right. We can get our McFlurry on.\" \"What about the love of a beautiful woman?\" Caretaker cast a glance at me. \"Unless she's the one for you, which I don't see happening, you're gona have to lower your standards on the beautiful part... And on the woman part.\" He gestured to a group of men in feminine cut jean clothing and makeup who gave us very gay \"heeeyyy\"s and blew kisses. Crew made a face and mumbled, \"Let's just stick with the cheeseburgers.\" Caretaker waved a hand. \"He may look ugly now, but in eight months, he's gonna look like Beyonce.\" \"No thanks.\" \"Now here's the most important part,\" Caretaker said as Paul and I leaned in closer to hear his low voice better. \"You can't let these guys scare you. You can't let them punk you. Because if you do that, you're gonna end up being somebody's bitch.\" I sighed. \"Don't want that.\" \"Thanks for the advice,\" Paul said as he stood from his seat. \"Where's he going?\" I asked. Caretaker shook his head. \"Good question.\" We watched as he made his way between tables until he was standing before a very big, very angry-looking hispanic man. Without hesitating, he grabbed the edge of his tin lunch tray and began pulling it away. The man turned and said something I couldn't hear to him. With one more remark, Paul smashed the tin tray into the top of the man's head. All hell broke loose. Friends of the fallen man jumped to attack Paul. Other men fought just because there was an opportuity. The trannies just stood in the corner screaming, \"Ah hell nah!\" Caretaker grabbed me by the elbow and lifted me with him. \"Stay down,\" he whispered, pushing me down and guiding me under the table. He had just straightened back into a standing position when I heard his voice yell over the cacophony of violence, \"Hornet's nest!\" Men everywhere dropped to the ground as whizzing noises covered their shouts. And then everything was silent. I glanced around. Everyone was on the ground, curled into the fetal position, or just trying to press themselves as close to the ground as possible. \"Everyone stay down!\" came a very testosterone-y voice (one I assumed belonged to the guard who threw the hornet's nest). I recognized Knauer's voice immediately, \"Come on, Crew, get up. Get up, Superstar.\" I heard Crew getting up, dusting himself off. \"Yes sir.\" I didn't turn around as Knauer continued. \"You think you can do anything you want around here, don't you? Well, you are no different than any other piece of shit that calls this place home.\" \"Really?\" Crew asked. \"These guys think you're a dumb redneck, too?\" I bit my lip around a giggle. I heard the impact of something, and I wish I had been watching because something awesome must've happened; a low murmur started to ripple through the motionless bodies on the ground. \"Better cut that shit out, it's getting old,\" Paul said cockily. The rest of their conversation was short and quiet. The end of it was signaled by the sound of Crew's body hitting the ground. Oo0oO Caretaker told me that they had taken Paul to the hotbox. It was a week before they let him out. I knew it had to have been hell. I had grown up in Texas my whole life. The heat of the south was as unforgiving as it was inescapable. During the day, I helped work in the kitchen, with some rather shady characters. I would've rather been outside in the sun (running the risk of running into that boy I had seen) but persuading the guards was proving to be more unhealthy for me than anything. Caretaker had shown me the ropes, given me tips and pointers on how to remain inconspicuous (though some of them were pointless considering my gender). I had made my way through prison thus far unscathed, unless you counted the frequent visits by Knauer. But even those were no worse than they had been the day I arrived. Now all I got was a smack or a fierce pinch every now and then. To my surprise, the trannies seemed to have formed some kind of bond with me. One I had been unaware of until they sat themselves beside me one day at lunchtime and began fervently discussing Angelina Jolie's gorgeous outfit at the Grammy's a few years before. At the end of the week, Caretaker and Paul approached me with the idea of starting a football team. Oo0oO \"It just seems kind of childish to me,\" I mumbled, toying with the end of my spoon. \"I mean, it's like the warden thinks we're just his harem of playdolls.\" Caretaker snorted. \"The warden is a little bit crazy,\" he admitted. \"But if Paul can do him a favor, things might go a little smoother for him.\" \"So why are you guys telling me about this?\" I asked. \"I'm a girl. A very fragile, easily-bruised, clumsy girl. There's no way I could play football. Especially not in a game between cops and robbers.\" \"Ah, but there is a way you could help,\" Paul said, giving me a devilish grin. \"You're going to help Caretaker and I with training and paperwork. Basically management.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Well, if it'll get me out of this damn kitchen, I'm in.\" Well, updates will definitely be coming more often now. Though it's not hard to rival the updating speed of a year :P Thank you guys for being patient with me, I have a tendency to start something new while I'm in the middle of something and then swamping myself with the lurking terror of unfinished stories.

LAUGUAGE! THIS IS THE MAJOR WARNING! Chapter 2 Kristen took a deepnbreath as she walked into the cafeteria. Brian had been so kind as tonlet her change in a bathroom. She now wore the blue sweatpants, whitentank top and a gray over shirt that said 'INMATE' on the back. Thenentire room fell silent as she walked in. Brian gave her a slightnpush on her back. She turned and glared at him as she walked to thenline. While she was waiting on her food, she took off the over shirt,nrevealing all her tattoo's to the rest of the room. She had CRIPSntattooed between her shoulder blades, barbed wire around her bicep,nwrists, and neck. No one spoke to her as she finished going throughnthe line. As she walked down the tables, she could feel someone'sneyes boring into her. She turned around to see a huge guy staring atnher. She set her tray down next to a black guy that was badlynscarred. She turned back to the big guy. \"Turley?\" shenasked, disbelief evident in her voice. The big man stood up. \"Kris?\" henasked, his voice heavily accented. Kristen ran towards himnand he caught her up in a hug. \"Can't breathe bignguy! Let me go! Come on Teddy Bear!\" she said, tapping him onnthe back. He set her back down on the ground. \" I didn't knownwhat happened to you since High School.\" \"I been here.\"nHe said, waving his arm around and almost taking out another inmatenby accident. She was about to replynwhen someone interrupted her. \"Inmate Marez, sitndown!\" one of the guards yelled. She flipped him off asnshe went and sat down with her tray. There was a white guy on thenother side of the black guy. The black guy stuck out his hand. \"Name's Caretaker.nAnd that's Paul Crewe.\" He said, nodding to the white guy. Kristen took his hand. \"Kristen Marez,nBitch From Hell, at your service.\" She said, smiling. They all laughed. Paulnwas staring at her eyes. \"How'd you getneyes like that?\" he asked. \"You gotta kill anfew people.\" She said, her voice serious. They were all quiet.nLunch went by pretty quick. She met Megget, NatenScarborough , andnCheeseburger Eddie. They took her out into the prison yard and showednher around. She walked away from them after a while and headedntowards the basketball court. All the guys stopped playing when shenwalked up. The leader walked up to her and looked her up and down. \"This ain't nonplace for you girl.\" He said, dribbling the ball around her. \"Really?\" shenasked as she stole the ball and made a basket from where she wasnstanding. \"I think I'm okay.\" \"Deacon.\" Hensaid, nodding his head. \"Kristen.\"nShe said, returning the nod. \"Already makingnfriends, are we Krissy?\" Brian said as he walked onto the court. Kristen sighed andnturned around. \"If I was, itnwouldn't be any of your business, now would it, Bri, Bri?\" shenasked. He slid his nightsticknout of its holder. \"It's CapitannKnauer.\" He said, bringing the nightstick towards her shoulder. She grabbed it and henspun her around so that her back was to his chest. \"That's assault onnan officer. I think three days in the hot box will teach you tonrespect your superiors.\" He said, hauling her away. \"Hope you don'tnmean yourself.\" She said as he shoved her into a truck. He locked her in a boxnat the edge of the fence. The heat overwhelmed her in about tennminutes. Her clothes started sticking to her and she passed out. She woke up when shenheard the door open. She moved her tongue around in her mouth untilnshe tasted blood. How'd that happen? She thought. Her head was poundingnand she felt like hell. \"Shit!\" shenheard and then she was lifted up into the sunlight. She was sat intonsomething that was air-conditioned and she sighed when the cold airnmet her face. Water splashed on her face and she tried to swallow it.nSomeone was lightly tapping her face. \"Kristen. Kristen,ntalk to me.\" Brian said. \"I'm all right.\"nShe said, pushing his hand away. He handed her thenbottle and got in the driver's side. He pulled up to the side of thenbuilding where the Warden's office was. \"Warden wants tonsee you.\" he said, helping her out of the truck. They walked to hisnoffice and went inside. \"Dr. Marez, itnseems to me that you and Capitan Knauer are well acquainted.\"nWarden Hazen said. \"Kinda sir.\"nShe said, avoiding both of their eyes. \"It seems thatnyou've also become quite popular with the inmate's.\" Wardennsaid. \"For your safety, I am putting you under Capitan Knauer'snfull protection.

He handed a boxnto Brian. \"Make sure she opens her package.\" \"Yes, sir.\"nBrian said as he took the box in one hand and her elbow in the other. He led her out of thenoffice and down the hallway. They passed the library and she paused. \"Please Br-, Inmean, Capitan Knauer?\" she asked. \"No, you'll likenthis better.\" He said, and pulled her towards an empty room. He set the box on thentable and opened it with a knife for her. She looked inside. Therenwas a letter, books, pictures, shampoo, conditioner, bras andnunderwear. \"Thank God for bignbrothers.\" She said softly. She heard Brian chucklenand she knew that they had been through the box, but she didn't care.nThe letter told her that he couldn't come and see her because of hisnprevious records and to just write him if she needed anything. Shenpicked up one book and read the back. \"Is that the onenthat you want to read now?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" Shensaid, and he took the box. \"Go to thencourtyard and talk to your 'friends'. I'll collect you after dinner.\"nHe said and he started to walk away. Kristen caught up withnhim before he was too far away. She jumped up and kissed his cheek. \"Thank you, fornnot being a total bastard.\" She said and then she headed towardsnthe courtyard, after she flashed him a brilliant smile.[Chapter 3] A/N: Plot and some characters are mine A/N: Plot and somencharacters are mine.

And that could be a good thing or a bad thing. \"He's playingnyou!\" Caretaker said, throwing his hands up in the air, thisntime in a fed up gesture. \"Come on, youncan't really think that he's being nice!

As they say, telegraph,ntelegram, teleinmate! Kristen sat apart from everyone else; she stillndidn't want to talk to the guys. Whispers were everywhere and shenlost it when she heard, \"I bet ten bucks she's screwing him bynthe end of the week.\" Kristen stood up andnwalked to the man who had said that. She grabbed his neck and pullednhim up. His face showed surprise as she kneed him in the stomach.nPeople started cheering as she broke his nose, stomped his foot andnthen was about to press the two pressure points in the neck that cutsnoff the blood to your brain when someone grabbed her from behind.nStrong arms wrapped around her waist and pulled her against theirnchest. They picked her up and carried her out of the cafeteria, hernyelling the whole time. \"Will you calmndown?!\" Brian asked as he let her go in the hallway. \"Yes, but henpissed me off! He made a bet that I would be sleeping with you by thenend of the week!\" she said. \"And you care?\"nhe asked, amazed. \"You never cared what people said about you.nAll that mattered was getting your education.\" \"That's thenproblem! I don't have anything to occupy my time except books!\"nshe countered. He started walking andnshe followed. \"Well, thatnproblem will be solved tomorrow. You are now the guards attendingnfootball physician.\" Brian said. \"And you will not leave mynsight. You've already got them riled up and Kruse has friends,nfriends that will not hesitate to harm you.\" Kristen sighed. \"Indon't know which is worse. Getting the shit beat outta me or dealingnwith the comments of being the football teams \"physician\".\"nShe muttered darkly. Brian didn't answer, henjust kept walking. Kris noticed that they were heading towards thenback of the prison, away from all of the cells. He was obviouslyntaking her to his room. He stopped in front of a door, typed in ancode on a key pad and opened the door. \"Paranoid much?\"nshe asked as she followed him in. \"No, that wasninstalled to keep you in .\" he said, turning around tonface her. His room was dark bluenwith a huge dresser, a TV with a DVD player, a stereo, a desk, ancloset and a huge bed. There was a door that led to what Kris assumednwas the bathroom. \"The bathroom'snthrough that door. All the stuff that your brother sent you is innthere. I'll find you a change of clothes. That's one thing yournbrother forgot to send you.\" he said, slightly condescending. \"Yeah, along withna toothbrush, toothpaste, a brush and lotion.\" She said and thennshe walked into the bathroom and closed the door. She grabbed hernshampoo, conditioner and jumped into the shower. She had just gottennin when she heard yelling. \"Capitan Knauer,nInmate Marez has another package! Warden wants you to come and getnit!\" someone yelled. There was a pause.n\"Fine! I'll be there in a sec!\" There was a knocking onnthe door. \"I have to go getnanother box that's yours. The room will be locked so don't even trynto leave.\" Brian said. \"Why would I wantnto leave when I have no clean clothes to change into?\" shenasked. \"Shut up.\" Hensaid and then left. Kristen smiled and wentnback to her shower. The warm water felt good on her dirty skin. Shenwashed her hair twice and then shut off the shower. She had justngotten out when the door opened. Brian walked in with another box. Henstopped when Kristen screeched. \"Get out!\"nshe yelled, grabbing a towel and covering herself. He stared at her for anminute. \"Your brother sentnthis box too. It has the lotion, brush, the rest of what you said andnclothes.\" He said, still staring at her. \"Thank you. Nownget out.\" She said, taking the box. He looked at her one lastntime and left. Kristen changed intonshorts and a tank top, put her hair in a towel, piled her stuff intonone box and walked out into the bedroom. Brain had just turned on thenTV and was sitting on the edge of the bed. He looked up when shenwalked in. \"You can have thenbathroom now.\" she said, putting her box in a corner. \"K.\" he said,ngrabbing some clothes from a chair and walking into the bathroom,nshutting the door. Kristen changed thenchannel from Football to Grease and sat down on the bed. She putnlotion on and was sitting there watching the movie when Brain camenout of the shower thirty minutes later. He came out in justnsweatpants and his hair was wet. She saw his six-pack and her breathnhitched. She had forgotten how good he looked without his shirt on.nHe had often paraded around the football field at Florida Statenwithout his shirt on. Most of the time for her benefit. He walked tonthe closet and got out a blanket. He grabbed a pillow from the bed,nset it on the floor and laid out the blanket. He was about to sitndown when Kristen spoke. \"What are youndoin?\" she asked. He looked up surprised.n\"Goin to bed.\" \"You're notnsleeping on the floor. You playin football and sleepin on a floor isngonna throw your back all outta whack. And I don't wanna have to popnit back into place!\" she said, standing up. \"We're bothnadults, mature adults and you know better than to trynanything.\" He half smiled and putnthe blanket back in the closet and set the pillow back on the bed. Henturned the covers down, walked to his dresser and opened the doors.nHe got out two cans and shut the doors. He threw one can at Kris andnshe caught it. It was a Budweiser. \"You are the bestnperson in the whole entire world Brian!\" she said, hugging him.nShe quickly pulled back but un-tensed when she saw his smile. \"Incan call you Brian now?\" \"Yes, but no BrinBri. And I won't call you Krissy.\" He said, sitting down on thenbed. \"Deal.\" Shensaid, opening the beer and sitting down also. They watched all ofnGrease and threw away their cans. Kris was the first to lie down andnBrian soon followed. He lay as close to the edge of the bed as hencould. Kris had her back to him and smiled. \"That hurts yournback too.\" She said. \"I don't bite. Hard.\" He laughed and scootedncloser into the bed. She heard him sigh in relief. She turned over,nkissed his cheek, and laid her head right beside his. He patted hernhead and they both fell asleep.

The last thingnChris saw of his partner and Uncle, they were standing together alongnside of the professor in the year of 2010, waving good bye... Suddenly, he wasnstanding in the middle of an ally, in the middle of night. He lookednaround and noticed it was cold as well. \"Well, Toto, Inguess we're not in Kansas any more...\" he moaned as he tried tongather his whits. Guess I'dnbetter see about getting a hotel, he thought as he walked out of the alley. He walked down further the street and saw a hotel that was crowdednwith drunks and hookers. Well, thisnshouldn't be too bad. At least they wouldn't think a cop would be innhere, he muttered to himself asnhe walked in. A fat man in his early fifties was manning the front desk and therenwas a window blocking his view. \"What can I do for ya?\" the man asked, not taking his eyes offnthe tv. \"I'd like a room, please.

He was thankful thatnmorning would come soon and he would shortly be with his father...[Chapter 2] Chris woke up the next morning, thensmell of the cigar still on his nostrils. He almost forgot where henwas, the weird sounds coming from his small window. He slowly got upnoff the bed, which wasn't all that comfortable, if he remembered thenbed at all. He got up and stretched. What to donnow? He walked over to thenwindow and opened it up for fresh air. \"Okay, Sykes.nGuess we gotta find dear old Dad. Course, he may not be workingntoday..\" Chris had never thought that his father might have a daynoff and that scared him just a bit. He remembered henonly had ten days to find Walburg and that wasn't a lot of time. After freshing upnin the hallway bathroom, he went down the stairs to the same crowdednlobby. A different person was watching the front desk, so he justnslipped on out the door. He should havenasked where the prescient was before he left, but he thought henshould know where it was. Besides, things couldn't have changed muchnin twenty six years, could it? As he was walking,nhe looked around the streets of Los Angeles. He chuckled at some ofnthe styles of clothing the people wore, the hair styles and the musicnhe heard. Thennhe realized he was hungry, but Chris just wanted to get to his fathernand Uncle. How can you even think of food at a time likenthis?? he moaned and shook hisnhead. He stopped when henrealized he didn't know where he was.

You can join me if you like,\" \"Thanks,\" Chrisnsmiled kindly. As they werenwalking, the Tectonese looked Chris up and down. \"You're not fromnhere, are you?\" That was the firstntime that Chris remembered his own clothing. \"Uh, no. I'm from NewnYork,\" Lier, Chris scolded himself. \"Never beennthere, but I heard it was nice.\" Chris shrugged.n\"It's okay for a home,\" Soon, the Tectonesenstops at the entrance of the station. \"Here we are,\"ncame the announcement of the Tectonese. \"Thanks,\" Chris followed thenalien into the building and then stopped when they got to the busynsection of it. The alien walked innfurther and Chris heard a voice booming from the back: \"ALBERT!nIt's about time you're here! We need toilet paper in the bathroom!\" The littlenTectonese that had helped Chris scurried to the other side of thenroom. Chris gasped. THAT'S Uncle Albert?? A man bumps intonChris as he hurries to his desk. Chris watches the man, thinking thenman looked oddly familiar. \"Matthew, it'snabout time you showed up!\" said the tall Alien,who was all readynsitting down. \"Sorry, George.nHad to take Cathy to the hospital,\" \"Is she allnright?\" \"Of course shenis. She has to work today, remember?\" the human chuckled. Chris' eyes grewnwide. That's Dad! George Fransisconlooks over at the young man who had been stirring at them. \"May we helpnyou?\" The young man goesnup to them and just looks at Matthew Sykes, who was busy trying tonfind some candy from his drawer. \"Uh, yes. I'mnlooking for Matthew Sykes and George Fransisco,\" \"You've foundnus,\" came Matt's voice from the drawer. \"You'll have tonexcuse my partner. He's useless unless he's had his chocolate,\"nGeorge said. \"I am not!\"nMatt muttered as he chews on a piece of chocolate. He looks up at thenyounger man. \"Matt Sykes, atnyour service. My partner, who thinks he knows me, is GeorgenFransisco.\" \"Hi,\" Chrisnsmiles, not knowing what else to say. \"And you are?\"nGeorge questions. \"Oh, I'm sorry.nI'm Chris,\" \"Chris what?\" Chris stammers fornan answer. He hadn't really even thought of what last name to givenhimself if had ever met his father. He looked around feverishly fornsome help. \"Uh, Tabletop.nChristopher Tabletop from New York,\" The three shooknhands. \"Sykes!nFransisco! In my office now! And bring that newcomer with you!\"ncame the same booming voice Chris had heard earlier. \"Duty calls..\"nMatt said as he stood up. George had put downnhis coffee on his desk and followed Matt. Chris followed his futurenfather and uncle into the office of the Captain. Matt closed thendoor behind Chris. \"What's up, Cap?\"nMatt asked, leaning against George. \"Who is HE andnwhat is HE doing here?\" Captain Frasier demanded from behind hisndesk. Chris decided tonstep up to the plate. \"I'm ChristophernTabletop, from New York, I'm here on a very important case that Inneed help from Sykes and Fransisco.\" Captain Frasiernlooked up at Chris, who now stood in between Matt and George. \"From New York,nhuh? What's the case about?\" Chris shifted hisnfeet and licked his lips. Now he was thirsty. \"I have to catchna killer and these two are the only ones who can help me,\" Liar! Matt looked over atnhis partner. \"Hey, the kid's got a tongue, George!\" \"He always hadnone, Matt...\" Matt chuckled.n\"Forget it, George,\" \"What killer arenyou talking about, Tabletop? I hadn't heard of any such thing.\" \"He's here tonkill my family and I've got ten days to do it in!\" Chris blurtednout. Damn... \"Your family?nWe'll help ya, kid. Just tell us who this person is..\" Matt said,nstraightening up in keen interest. \"Tony Walburg,\" Chris told him. \"Walburg? Thenonly Walburg we know of is John Walburg and he's around seventy,nisn't he, George?\" George nodded.n\"Yes, but he could have family here, Matthew.\" \"You're right,nGeorge. I think we'd better look at some books,\" Matt said. The three of themnturned to the door. \"Where do thenthree of you think you're going? I haven't dismissed you yet?!\" Matt turned to facenthe Captain and smiled. \"Sorry, Cap. We're on a mission!\" hensaluted and quickly closed the door behind the three of them beforenCaptain Frasier could say another word.[Chapter 3] Chris follows Matt and George to theirndesks. But, instead of picking out some photo books, Matt picks upnhis leather jacket. \"Matthew, what are you doing? We'rensupposed to look at photo's!\" George moaned. \"Hey, I'm hungry, okay? And I'm surenChris is, too. Think you can eat, kid?\" \"Uh, yeah. I can eat,\" Chris nods. It was starting to get hard not tellingnhis father who he really was. And he had just met the guy! As he walked behind Matt and George, henwatched and listened to them talking. At times Matt, his father,nwould tease George at something that would make George roll his eyes.nOther times, they would talk seriously about something. \"So, Chris. What's your pleasure forndinning?\" Matt asked. \"It really doesn't matter to me,nMatt. I can eat just about anything right now!\" Chris rubbed hisnstomach as he heard it growl. \"Well, we have this great restaurantnthat serves just about anything and everything. You game?\" Mattnsmiled. \"Sure,\" Chris shrugged. They got to Matt's car and Chris justnlooked at it. Oh, my god! That's the car! He gasped inwardly. \"Chris? You okay,nson?\" Matt asked. Chris blinked. \"Uh, yes. I'mnfine,\" The three climbedninto the car and Chris automatically excepted the back seat as hisnown. The drive was quietnas Chris just looked out the window, gazing a the sight of LosnAngeles. Matt stopped thencar in front of a restaurant that seemed all ready crowded. They were escortednto a table and were given drinks of water. Chris sipped the coolnliquid gladly. \"So, Chris. Hownlong have you been here?\" Matt asked, to break the ice. \"Oh, I just gotnin last night.\" \"Where are younstaying at?\" George wanted to know. \"Right now I'm atna hotel called 'Little Johns'. It's not too bad,\" Matt groaned.n\"Little John's? Kid, that's in a really bad spot.\" \"I can take carenof myself, ya know?\" Chris said, agitation n his voice Matt held up his hands in protest.n\"Sorry, guess that's my parenting skills coming into view.\" \"I didn't know you had othernchildren,\" Chris said, taking another sip. \"Yeah, I have a daughter who's atncollege.\" \"Matt's real proud of her,\" Georgenchimed in. \"George,\" Matt moaned. \"Well, it's true.\" \"Yeah, but ya gotta tell everybody?\" The waiter came with the menu's, butnGeorge waved them away from him. \"I all ready know what I'd like.nGrilled squirl and hash browns, please.\" \"Hmmmm, grilled squirl. That's soundsngood, Think I'll have that, too!\" Said Chris, which shocked Matt. \"What?\" Chris asked, seeing thenlook Matt's face. \"You eat that stuff?\" \"Oh, didn't I tell you? I'm halfnhuman, half Tectonese.\" George smiled when Chris told Mattnthat. \"Oh, great. Just what I need. To benout numbered!\" Matt sighed. He looked up at the waiter, who wasnpatiently waiting for his order. \"I'll have the number four, please,nwith extra hash browns.\" Chris leaned towards George. \"What'sna number four?\" \"Double of everything,\" came thenanswer. \"Oh,\" As they waited for their food, Chrisnasked Matt and George about their families. Actually, he just wantednto hear his father speak. The food came and Chris didn't realizenhow hungry he was till he bit into the grilled squirl! Matt shuttered. \"You guys are gross,\" he said, asnhe put a forkful of eggs in his mouth. \"And, that is not?\" George asked,npointing at the mound of food on Matt's plate. \"What, this stuff? Hey, at least Inwon't have any hair in my teeth after I eat!\" Chris laughed. He was having so muchnfun listening to his future father and future Captain argue. He couldn't help it. At the end of breakfast, they went backnto the prescient to look at photo's. Matt had turned on his computer whilenGeorge and Chris looked at the half a dozen books. \"Chris...is that him?\" Matt asked.nChris went over to the computer. \"My guy wouldn't be in your computersnor books, Matt. He's not from around here,\" Matt looked up at the younger man.n\"Kid, the computer and the books have just about every criminal innthe world.\" Just how could he explain to his fathernthat HIS Walburg was from another time? That HE was from anotherntime? Maybe his father would understand, after all, he was workingnwith an alien! Chris shook his head. No, younidiot!It might ruin your own existence! And you can't take thatnchance! He clinched his fistsnangrily. \"Christopher, arenyou all right?\" George asked from his desk. \"Yes, I'm fine,nGeorge.\" how many times was he going to be asked that? \"You're sure we won't find him here?\" Chris shook his head. \"No, we won't.nBut, I'm sure if we went to YOUR Walburg, mine will be there.\" Matt scrolled down the page for JohnnWalburg and found the address and phone number. \"Got it. Let's go,\" The three headed for the car. \"How long till we get there?\" Chrisnasked anxiously. \"Hmmmmmm, I think it's about a twentynminute drive.\" Matt said as he pulled the car out of the parkingnlot. \"Twenty minutes!?\" Chris gasped. Matt chuckled as George explained,n\"Walburg wanted to get away from society, Christopher. Once he gotnout of jail, he was able to find a place that suited his needs.\" Sighing, Chris leaned back and tried tonenjoy the ride the best he could. Finally, they got to the house. \"George, you take the back. Chris,nfollow me.\" Matt said as they got out of the car. \"Wait, let me see if there's anyonenin there first.\" Chris said, stopping Matt and George. \"How can you do that? We're ten feetnaway from the house!\" Matt demanded. \"One of my powers as being half humannand half Tectonese, is that I can see farther than a human can.\" Chris told him gently. \"Oh,\" Matt looked over at George,nwho just shrugged. Chris squinted his eyes and shieldednthem from the sun. It was dark in the house and hardly anyone there.nHe saw a skeleton, but wasn't sure if it was from an alive person orndead. \"There's someone or something innthere and I'm not sure if it's dead or alive,\" Chris told them withna sigh. \"George, just keep your gun closenjust in case.\" Matt said with caution. George nodded quietly. The three of them walked gingerly tonthe house. Chris entered first, Matt followed with George closenbehind him. \"Where's this body you saw, Chris?\"nMatt asked. \"Behind the couch,\" Chris gulped. Matt walked behind the beige creamyncouch and moaned. \"Well, there's John Walburg,\" henannounced.[Chapter 4] Chris walked behind the couch, readynfor just about anything, but his body was tense. Sure enough, therenlaid a near dead John Walburg. Chris fell to his knees, next to thenbody and found that John Walburg was still breathing. Barely... Chris grabbed the shirt of the oldernman. \"WHERE IS HE??\" Chris demanded,ntalking through gritted teeth. \"He...he...\" \"WHERE, DAMN IT!?\" \"Chris, calm down!\" Matt said,nputting a hand on the younger man's shoulder. Chris shrugged off thenhand. \"He's...he's near--\" Walburg didn'tnfinish. The older man rolled his eyes in the back of his head andndied. \"NO!\" Chris screamed, his handsntightening on the man's shirt. Anger was now building inside him,nready to spill over. \"Christopher, let go of him.\"nGeorge said quietly as Matt called in for an ambulance. Chris heard George, just he justncouldn't let go or take his eyes off of John Walburg. He was soooonclose to John, he KNEW it! He could smell the scent of the stankyncigar that John smoked. Suddenly, he titled his head. Was itnhim, or did he hear something? It was faint, but it was in the house.nThey were not alone... He stood up and started for the stairs. \"Chris, where you going?\" Mattnasked. \"I hear something...\" was all hencould say. Chris walked up to the second floor and turned to thenright. He stopped before he went any further.nThe faint sound, now beginning to sound like a whimper, becamenlouder. He went to the hallway closet andnopened the door. There was a little girl, tied up and gagged. She wasncrying and her big brown eyes gazed up at him, fear clearly seen innthem. Tectonese, Chris moaned. \"It's going to be all right,\" hensaid in Tectonese as he cut the rope that binded her wrists and feet.nHe pulled the tape off her mouth slowly so he wouldn't hurt her. He wrapped his arms around her and shenhugged him so tight he could almost breath. Chris could feel hernshaking and she kept whimpering in his ear. \"It's okay,\" he whispered again,n\"No one can hurt you now,\" that seemed to calm her as he carriednher down the stairs. Matt and George met him at the bottom. \"What do we have here?\" Matt said,nhis voice light and his eyes grew tender as he looked at the littlengirl. \"I think Walburge kidnapped her, tiednher up and put her in the closet. Matt, she's really scared!\" \"Good Lord,\" Matt whistled. George tried to take the little girlnfrom Chris, but the girl whimpered and tightened her grip on Chris. \"He won't hurt you. He's a policenofficer,\" Chris said in Tectonese. \"I want Mommy,\" she said in hisnear. \"I know. You'll be with her soon,\"nChris told her quietly as they walked out the house and towards thencar. \"Is there anything else I should knownabout you, kid?\" Matt asked as he opened the door for Chris. Chris smiled at his father. \"Couldnbe,\" Wish I COULD tellnyou, DAD. The little girl kept her arms around Chris, her head buried her headnin his chest. Her crying had stopped and she was fading off to sleep. \"She's really scared,\" Chris said. She was still shaking like anleaf. \"We'll find her parents shortly. Just, when she wakes up, just asknher about them.\" Matt said as he kept his eyes on the road. \"I will,\" Chris nodded. They got to the prescient and walked in the crowded building. Theyngot to Matt and George's desks. Chris tried to put the girl down onnthe chair by George's desk, but she refused to let go of his neck. \"It's okay, I won't let you go.\" Chris told her as he sat down. He asked her who her parents were, she told him and he relayed theninformation to Matt, who dialed the number. Matt gave the phone to Chris, who talked in Tectonese to one of thenparents. He hung up the phone and looked at Matt. \"They said they'll be here shortly,\" \"Good,\" Matt said and he looked at the little girl. \"I betnshe's hungry,\" \"Are you hungry?\" Chris asked her in her language. She noddedneagerly, turning her head towards Matt. \"I'll go get her something,\" Matt got up as George put a hand onnhis arm. \"What?\" Matt demanded. \"You don't know what she can eat,\" Matt shrugged. \"Hey, she's a kid. All kids like candy, Tectonese ornnot!\" George shook his head and looked at Chris. \"Sometimes I don't fullynunderstand my partner,\" Chrisnsmiled at him. \"I don't understand mine, either.\" Ain'tnthat the truth! Matt went to the vending machine. \"So, you can see through buildings and hear further than we can.nAnything else, Christopher?\" George asked as he sat down at hisndesk. \"No, I don't think so. I guess that's what makes me a good cop,nhuh?\" George nodded and he spotted a Tectonese couple. \"I believe hernparents are here,\" he announced. Chris turned and mentioned it to the little girl. She perked up hernhead and smiled when she saw her parents. \"Mommy! Daddy!\" she cried out in Tectonese and reached out fornthem. The parents ran to her, crying. Chris gave her to them and they looked at Chris thankfully. \"Thank you,\" the father said in English. Chris watched the family leave the station. Tears welled up in hisneyes as a longing crept into his heart. Matt put a hand on the younger man's shoulder. \"Hey, you okay, kid?\" Matt asked. Chris turned his own brown eyes to his father. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Injust miss my family is all,\" \"Well, hopefully we'll catch this character of your's so that youncan get back to them in the time you need to get back.\" Mattnsmiled. \"I sure hope so, Matt. I sure hope so,\" Chris forced a smile. \"I think I know what you need, Chris. You need a night full of funnand laughter! I think you've been working to damn hard since you'venbeen here,\" Matt told him. \"No, please. I'm fine. I just need to catch this guy and get backnhome,\" \"We understand, Chris. We just think all work and no play makes andull boy,\" \"Well, okay. As long as we can get back to the case by tomorrow.\"nChris sighed as he allowed to be led out of the prescient.[Chapter 5] The three detectives went to George'snhouse. Buck and Emily met them at the door. \"Who's the new guy?\" Buck asked asnthey came in the house. \"Buck, Emily, meet ChristophernTabletop from New York.\" George introduced the younger man. Chris fixed his brown eyes on Emily,nwho smiled at him. So, this is how Em looked like when she was a kid,nhuh? Cute... \"Hi, ya. Welcome to the nut house,\"nBuck said. \"Buck...\" George moaned. Chris laughed. \"It's okay, George. Infelt the same way when I was his age.\" \"Do I hear men's voices in thenhouse?\" a female voice came. A female Tectonese came into view andnChris almost bowled over. He knew his mouth must have fell open asnhis father went to the woman and gave her a big hug. \"Chris, this is my friend, Cathy.\"nMatt introduced him to her. Cathy Frankel kindly shook Chris' hand.n\"Pleasure to meet you, Christopher.\" she smiled at him. \"Like wise, I'm sure.\" Chrisnanswered. \"Ugh! This is getting sickening!nC'mon, Em. Let's get Chris upstairs quick before they brain washnhim!\" Buck said, grabbing Chris by the arm. \"Remember, Buck, dinner will be innone hour.\" George said. \"Yeah, yeah. We won't be late,\"nBuck sighed. The three younger people went up stairs. An hour later, Matt called for them toncome down for dinner. The conversation was light and airy.nMatt was right, Chris decided. He was having fun and for once in anlife time he was enjoying it. \"Hey, Chris, wanna come upstairs withnus?\" Buck asked. \"Give the guy a break, Buck. He's allnready been up there,\" Matt moaned as he drank his coffee. \"Look, maybe he doesn't wanna benaround you old farts.\" Buck smirked. \"Hey!\" Matt throws a napkin at himnand Buck ducks out of the way. \"Yeah, I'll go upstairs with ya,nBuck.\" Chris got up and whipped his mouth. \"Mrs. Fransisco, that was a wonderfulnmeal.\" he complimented her. Susan beamed from ear to ear. \"Why,nthank you, Christopher. I was amazed that you liked Grilled squirl.\" \"One of my favorite meal, ma'am.\" \"Christopher,\" she said before henwent upstairs. \"Since you'll be working with mynhusband, I would like you to address me as Susan.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Chris nodded as henfollowed Buck and Emily to their rooms. Emily jumped on Buck's bed. \"I can'tnget over how much you look like Uncle Matt!\" she said crossing hernlegs. Buck turned Chris, so that they werenfacing each other. \"Ya know something, Em, you'renright.\" Buck crossed his arms. \"Are you related to him ornsomething?\" \"In a way,\" Chris nodded. Emily got off the bed and went tonBuck's record player. She put on his Beach Boys album. \"You know how to dance, Christopher?\"nEmily asked. The song I GET AROUND camenon. \"Not really. Indon't get a chance to go out much,\" \"We can teachnyou,\" Emily smiled, taking his hand. His heart began to race.nC'mon, Sykes, she might be your finance, but that's in thenfuture...waaaay into the future. \"Yeah, Chris.nEm's a great teacher,\" Buck said, jumping on his bed. \"I'm sure younknow how to dance, Buck?\" Chris demanded. \"Unfortunately,nI'm taking lessons at school. I don't know why, I won't need them innthe future.\" Buck sighed. \"That'snfor sure,\" Chris said. Ooooops. \"What was thatnsupposed to mean?\" Buck asked, leaning on his one elbow. \"I mean, youndon't look like someone who will need dancing lessons in the future.\"nChris covered himself. \"Oh, thanks. Tellnmy folks that,\" Buck sighed. \"I can give it ango,\" Chris smiled. \"Okay, Chris, I'mngonna teach you how to dance.\" Emily said. For a full hour,nEmily taught Chris how to dance to Beach Boys music. Chris had tonadmit, he was liking it. Suddenly, his feet got caught in Emily's andnthey both fell on the floor with a loud thud. Downstairs, thenadults heard the commotion. \"What in thenworld?\" all four of them got up and ran up the stairs. They heardnthe music and laughter coming from Buck's room, so they went there. They saw Chris andnEmily on the floor laughing and Buck on the bed laughing as well. \"What happened?\"nMatt asked. \"Let's just saynthat Chris has two left feet!\" Emily said between fits of laughter.nHer laughter made everyone else laugh as well. Chris got red in thenface, embarrassed of his mistake. \"We're sorry,nChristopher. Understand we're laughing with you, not at you.\" Cathynsmiled. Chris nodded. \"Will the rest ofnyou go back downstairs, please?\" Emily asked, once the laughingndied down. \"Of course,\" The older peoplenwent back down. A few minutesnlater, Buck brought his tape player and Emily and Chris came downntogether. Chris felt nervous, never have dance in front of a crowdnbefore. Even if it was family. \"Ladies andngentlemen, we proudly present Emily and Chris dancing to I GETnAROUND by the BEACH BOYS,\" Buck got out of the way and turnednon the music as the 'crowd' clapped. The dance lasted for about 10 minutes,nbut to Chris it felt like an eternity. At the end, they got a goodnapplause. He plopped down on the couch besidesnMatt, who was sitting next to Cathy. \"Hey, don't we get any more?\" Mattncomplained. \"You're lucky you got that much!\"nChris playfully hit Matt in the shoulder. Matt laughed. Suddenly, Chris felt like he needednsome fresh air. It was getting much too warm in the house. \"I need some fresh air,\" he gaspednand Matt watched him go outside. Cathy touched Matt's arm. \"Is he all right?\" she asked. \"I'll go check it out,\" Matt got upnand followed Chris to the front porch. Chris had his hands on the railing andnhe was just looking out to the sky. \"Hey, buddy, you okay?\" Matt asked. Chris turned to face him. \"I-I-I wishnI can tell you,\" \"Tell me what?\" Chris shook his head. \"I can't. I'venbeen sworn,\" \"Christopher, whatever it is, I'llnunderstand.\" \"No, Matt. You won't,\" Chris flungnhis arms up in aggravation. \"Hell, I don't understand it myself!\" Matt put a hand on his shoulder. Argh, Dad, why did you have do that?nWhy do you have to be so damn nice? \"It might help ifnyou talk about it,\" \"No, it won't.nIt'll make matters worse,\" Dad, stop it, please! \"What will?\"nMatt pressured. \"I CAN'T TELLnYOU, DAMN IT! Can't you understand??\" Chris was now getting angry.nNow he understands why Uncle George could get frustrated with Dadnquite often. Matt put up hisnhands in protest. \"Okay, kid. I won't say anything more. I'm gonnango back in. You gonna be okay?\" Chris could onlynnod. How right Uncle George was. He WAS like his father![Chapter 6] Matt and Cathy came out of the housenwith George and Susan. Matt put a hand on Chris's shoulder. \"Well, kid, it's time Cat and I sayngoodbye.\" Matt smiled. \"Why? You going home? All ready?\"nChris asked. He really didn't want Matt to leave so soon. He onlynhave about eight days left in this time frame. Matt sighed. \"Yeah, well, Cat has tonwork in the morning, soooo.\" Cathy playfully swats Matt on the back.n\"Matthew Sykes! You know you gotta work in the morning as well as Indo!\" He put up his hands in protest. \"Hey,nI was only kidding!\" \"Sure you were,\" Cathy nodded tonChris, who could only laugh. He loved watching his future parentsnfight, especially since it was a play fight. \"ANYWAYS, catch ya in the morning,nkid.\" As Matt and Cathy walked down the car,nChris sighed. It would be so much better if Matt and Cathy were alivenin 2010... \"You're okay to spend the night here,nChristopher.\" Susan was saying. \"No, I have a place at LittlenJohn's.\" Susan's eyes grew wide. \"YOU'REnstaying at Little John's!?\" she gasped. \"Sure, what's wrong with that?\"nChris shrugged. \"Christopher, don't you know whatngoes on in that place? It's not safe for a young man, especially forna human!\" \"Hey, I'm a cop. I can take care ofnmyself,\" \"Christopher, please. It will be morendangerous for you if they find out who you are! There are whores andnrobbers, drug addicts and so forth staying there. Why do you thinknit's so cheep?\" \"Oh, I was wondering why that was.\"nit was Chris's turn to be shocked. \"So, Christopher, you're staying withnus until you find Walburg.\" George said. \"Okay, I'll stay here. But, I'llnsleep on the couch.\" George shook his head. \"No. Buck hasnanother bed in his room. You can stay there,\" \"I don't want to put anyone out,\"nChris said as they went into the house. \"Buck, Christopher will be stayingnwith you for the next eight days.\" George announced to his son. \"Sure,\" Buck shrugged. Chris chuckled. Same ol' Buck. Nevernreally caring on what's going on as long as he's involved. The two new friends went up stairs.nThey past Emily's room and she was laying on her bed, readingnsomething. \"What ya reading, Em?\" Buck asked. Emily sighed and looked at them.n\"Homework. I've got tons of it,\" \"Ugh. I remember homework, glad Indon't have to do that any more!\" Chris said. \"You're lucky. We're always stucknwith a bunch of homework,\" Buck told him. \"Why aren't you doing your's?\"nChris wanted to know, though he fully knew why. Buck let out a chuckle. \"I did minenin study hall. I hate homework and I hate doing it at home. I'd muchnrather do something else,\" \"Like what?\" \"He likes to hang with his friends,\"nEmily smiled. \"Normal teenage stuff. You know,nChris.\" \"Yeah, I know. But, me, I likednhanging at the police station.\" \"Yuck,\" Emily said. Chris smiled at her. \"Not really, Em.nMy father was a police officer, so I just went there to hang out withnhim and watch him work.\" Finally, he and Buck went into Emily'snroom and the three of them sat on her bed. For an hour, Buck andnChris helped her with homework. The time frame he was from, Chris hadnNEVER seen any of this stuff Emily had! He fascinated himself bynwatching Buck helping her, noticing how close the two of them were. The next morning, Chris woke up withnsomeone shaking him. He had forgotten where he was as the bed feltncomfortable and he didn't want to get out of it! \"Chris, c'mon, man. It's almost sevennand Dad's havin' a fit cuz you're not ready yet!\" came Buck'snvoice. Chris moaned and pulled the blanketnover his head. \"Can't you tell him I'll be down in a few minutes?\" \"No, Chris. Dad's ready now and isnall ready drinking his second coffee!\" \"Oh, boy! Guess I'd better get up!\"nChris throws the blanket off himself and yanks his father's jeans andnt-shirt on. He practically threw the loafers on his feet and headedndownstairs. Sure enough, George was in the kitchennsipping on some coffee that Chris knew for certain that he hadnmustard in it. \"Ahhh, did you sleep well,nChristopher?\" George asked. \"Yes, thank you. Sorry I'm late,\" \"That is all right, Christopher. Mattnwon't be here for another hour, so you'll have time for breakfast.\" Chris sighed. He had to wait anothernhour before seeing his dad again?? \"May I?\" Chris asked, pointing atnthe coffee pot. \"Of course,\" George smiled. \"Tell me, Christopher, why does thisnWalburg want to kill your parents?\" George questioned. \"I told you, didn't I?\" Chrisnasked, putting a couple of teaspoons of sugar in his coffee. \"No, I don't believe so.\" \"Well, my partner and I had put himnin prison for life and he just wants to do me in. He figures the bestnway to do it is to kill the people that are the closest to me,\" You're getting way too good at this lying, Sykes... They talked fornawhile and then they heard a beep outside the house. George lookednout the window and waved. \"That is Matthew,nChristopher. Let's start the day,\"[Chapter 7] As the three of them entered thenstation, they were greeted by Albert. Albert looked at Chris withnwide eyes. \"Christopher, you look almost likenMatt!\" Albert gasped as he winged something in his hands. Matt got along side of Chris and put annarm around the younger man's shoulders. \"Yeah, it's scary, isn't it?\" Mattnsmiled and they walked passed Albert. Chris sat down next to Matt's desk andna far away look came in his brown eyes. \"What's up, kid?\" Matt asked as henstarted searching in his drawer for a pencil. \"Hmm?\" Chris blinked back tonreality. \"You looked like you were far away.nWhere were you?\" \"Oh, just thinking about home.nWondering what my partner is doing now,\" Chris shrugged. \"Why don't ya just call him?\" Chris chuckled. \"He doesn't likenphones, Matt. Says they're a bother,\" damn, you're good. \"I can understand why,\" Mattnsmiled. \"Ah ha! Found one!\" Matt pulled upna pencil and shut his drawer. \"I usually have a tough time findingna pencil,\" Matt explained to Chris, who had a puzzled look on hisnface. \"Oh,\" Chris sighed. \"I can not believe there is noncoffee!\" George moaned. Chris had not noticed that George had leftnthem to get a cup of coffee. \"George, I'm sure you've all readynhad three cups before I came to pick you up.\" \"Make that four, Matt. We talkednawhile as I ate breakfast,\" \"Well, someone NEEDS to make more.\" Hearing George, Albert went to thenemployee lounge to make the coffee. He knew that George was not innfull swing unless he was full of caffeine. Suddenly, Chris heard Tony's voice innhis mind. It was one of his powers, that he could hear voices fromnfar away. \" Well, good morning, my youngnfriend. It's too bad you didn't catch me yesterday, but I'm glad younfound the little girl. I really wasn't going to hurt her, you see.nJust an added bonus for you. I have left a \"Whatnmessage, Walburge? Where are you?!\" Chris muttered out loud. Matt put a hand onnthe man's shoulder. \"Chris, are you all right?\" he asked. \"Do you have anTimothy Johnson working today?\" Chris asked, ignoring Matt'snconcern. George nodded. \"Inbelieve so,\" \"Do you knownhim?\" \"Yes, he's in thenoffice with Frasier right now.\" Before he allowednGeorge to finish, Chris was heading for the office. \"Chris, I don'tnthink you should go in there!\" Matt called after him, but it wasntoo late. Chris barged in thenoffice, interrupting whatever conversation was going on. \"I certainly hopenyou have a perfectly good reason for this out burst, Tabletop!\"nsaid Frazier. Chris totallynignored the Captain and went to Johnson. \"I'm told you have anmessage for me,\" he demanded. The blond hairnofficer looked at him in surprise with his blue eyes. \"Yes, yes Indo. But, how did you...\" Chris extended hisnhand. \"Just give it to me, please.\" The officerncomplied and handed him the note. Without saying another word, Chrisnwent back to Matt's desk and sat down. He opened up the folded note. It read: I know you have only a few daysnleft, Detective Sykes. And I also know that if you don't find me andndon't get back to our own time, you will cease to exist. I will makenit easier on you, but you must play it my way. I know you don't wantnany more people killed. I really didn't want to kill my greatngrandfather, but he was being a big bother! If you want to find me, head mynwords carefully. I have someone you love dearly and she won't getnhurt unless you come to us ALONE. I am at a warehouse passed the Woknand Roll dinner. Meet us there at six o'clock tonight and comenunharmed... Tony Walburge Chris folded thennote back up and put it in his coat pocket. The note nerved him. Whoncould Tony be talking about? Not Emily! She didn't have any part innthis...even in the future! He clinched his fists and tried not tonscream. \"Chris, Chris,nwhat's the matter?\" Matt's voice came to him. Chris was so fillednwith anger, he couldn't speak. His dark brown eyes filled with hatenand he could feel his fingertips digging into his palms. \"Christopher!\"nGeorge was saying, putting his hand on the younger man's shoulder. Hencould feel Christopher's shoulder shake. \"He, he's gotnEmily.\" Chris said, once he found his voice. \"Who's got Emily?nWalburge?\" Matt wanted to know. Chris could only nod. \"Where is he?\"nGeorge demanded. \"He said he wasnnear some dinner called 'Wok and Roll',\" \"I know wherenthat is. I used to take my dates there all the time,\" Matt said asnhe got up. \"No, Matt. I'mntold to go alone,\" Chris shook his head. \"In the statenyou're in? No way, son. Besides, you don't this town.\" \"Just tell me hownto get there, I'll find it. Please, Matt. Let me go. He'll kill hernif you come with me!\" Matt could hear thenanger and frustration in the man's voice and understood. \"All right,\"nMatt took off his walkie talkie and handed it to him. \"George hasnone, so if you get into trouble, call us. And take my car,\" Henthrew the keys to the younger man, who caught them with no problem. Suddenly, George'snphone rang and he picked it up. \"Yes, Buck. We know she's missing,nwe just found out. Christopher is going after the man who has her.nNo. Under no circumstances are you to go! Yes, I know she's yournsister, but the man had demanded that Chris go alone. Just stay therenand we will call you when we get Emily safe and sound,\" Georgenhangs up the phone and looks over at Chris. \"Once you findnthem, call us and we'll send help.\" Chris nodded. Mattnhands him his gun, but Chris waves it off. \"I don't need that,\" \"Of course not,\"nMatt sighed, putting the gun back in his belt buckle. He watched thenyoung man walk out of the station and turns to George. \"I still don'tnthink he should go there alone,\" He tells George. \"Neither do I,\"nGeorge agreed. They waited for anfew minutes. It was lucky they knew where Wok and Roll was, so theyndidn't have to follow Chris quite so close. After a few minutesnof driving, they came to an abandon building. They watch Chris getnout of Matt's car and walk gingerly into the building. Chris opened thendoor slowly, his free hand on the walkie talkie that his father hadngiven him. \"Walburge, I'mnhere! Now, let the girl go!\" he shouted. \"No way, Sykes!nYou didn't do as I ask!\" came the voice. \"What are yountalking about? No one came with me!\" \"You think I'mnstupid, Sykes? Take a look outside. Your father and Uncle followednyou!\" Chris looked outnthe window and seethed through gritted teeth in anger. What the hellnwas his father thinking?! \"I'll make themngo away! Just don't hurt the girl!\" Walburge came intonview, his hand having a tight grip on Emily's arm. She was crying asnher big blue eyes looked at Chris in fear. It's gonna be okay, Em. I swear it! He thought. \"As you can see,nSykes, I haven't hurt this girl. Not yet, anyway. But, since youndidn't follow my instructions, I'll have to leave you with thisnprecious girl. Remember now, you only have but five days left!\" All Chris could donwas watch Walburge leave the premises with Emily. He turned and wentnout the building and headed towards Matt and George. Matt and Georgenclimbed out of the car. \"What happened? Where's Emily?\" Georgendemanded. \"What the hell donyou think you were doing?! I told you not to follow me!\" Chrisnhollered. \"We thought we'dnmake sure you were safe...\" Matt told him. \"I KNOW HOW TOnHANDLE WALBURGE! YOU ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE EMILY!\" Chris saidnangrily. He started pacingnaround, kicking the dirt. He didn't know how to express his angernwithout hurting anyone. \"I've only gotnfive days to find him again! You guys just don't understand! My life,nmy whole life is in jeopardy if I can't find him and take him backnhome!\" Matt looked over atnGeorge. \"Do you know what he's talking about?\" All George could donwas shake his head. He didn't understand any of this, but once Chrisncalmed down, he was going to have to make the young man tell themneverything...[Chapter 8] Chris started to walk away from them. Feeling the tension, George walkednafter the younger man and forced him to turn around. \"What?\" Chris demanded, his brownneyes piercing with anger. George held up his hands. \"I knownyou're angry, Christopher. And it's understandable, but know this:nthat is MY daughter Walburg is holding and I need to know she's allnright.\" Chris faught everything in his body notnto punch the alien. That was his future lover that was in the handsnof a killer. Chris sighed. \"Listen, I know hownmuch you care for Emily. Really, I do. But, you don't know Walburg asngood as I do. I'm the only one who can handle him,\" At this time, Matt had come to them.n\"Speaking of knowing someone, Chris, we really don't know anythingnabout you.\" Chris looked at his father and had tonchuckle. \"What's so funny?\" Matt asked. \"Sorry. It's just that this wholenthing is a joke. I can't tell you who I am, so please, don't ask me.\" \"Why can't you tell us?\" Georgenwanted to know. \"If I told you about who I am, thenlives of a lot of people would be at risk. Trust me, I would LOOOOVEnto tell you both, but I can't.\" Matt looked over at his partner. \"Guessnwe'll have to live with that, George, until he's good and ready.\" Chris sighed. \"Thanks, Matt.\" \"But, you WILL tell us?\" Mattnasked. \"I might,\" Chris said. The road back to the precent was a longnone. Long and quiet. Matt kept looking back at the young man, who'snface was not a happy one. Chris had his chin in his left palm andngazing out the window. More than likely thinking on what wasnhappening to Emily. \"She'll be okay,\" Matt said, tryingnto break the silence. \"I'm not too sure, Matt. Walburg isnon shakey terms right now. It's interesting that he knows I have onlynfive days.\" Chris did not turn from the window whennhe said that. He didn't want Matt or George to see how angry he really was. What if he really messed up? This wasngoing all wrong. He needed to get Walburg and soon. He just wished hencould tell Matt the whole story... Suddenly, another message from Walburgncame to him: \"Bad move, Sykes. Have no fear, yournprecious alien girlfriend here is still alive and kicking. I want tonhave you squirm and sweat for awhile longer,\" \"Where are you, Walburg?\" \"Uh, uh. Not so fast. Remember, Inknow Matt Sykes is your father and you'd like to spend more time withnhim. BEFORE his time is up,\" \"You touch ONE hair on his head...\" \"And you'll do what, Sykes? I seem tonhave the upper hand here, don't I? I'll give you more information asnthe days go by. Until then, ta ta.\" \"Walburg! Walburg!!\" Chris had siadnthat out loud with out meaning to and the two older detectives shotnhim a strange look. \"You all right, Chris?\" Matt asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Chris muttered,nnot really meaning it. Matt turned the car into the parkingnlot of the police department and turned the vehicle off. He turned innhis seat to look at Chris. \"Okay, you need to tell us just whatnhappened here.\" he demanded. Chris sighed. Well, maybe that part hencould tell these two guys. \"All right. Yes, I AM half human,nhalf Tectonese. One of my powers is able to communicate through thenmind. I can have a full conversation without people actually knowing nabout it.\" Matt looked over at George. \"Is thatnpossible?\" George shrugged. \"Yes, it is. He'snhalf tectonese, so it's possible that he could have that kind ofnpower.\" \"Can you read minds?\" Chris shook his head. \"No,\" \"Oh, that's good, cuz I don't thinknyou'd like to know what I'm thinking right now.\" Matt breathed ansigh of relief. Chris grinned. \"I can only imagine,\" At the resturant, the three detectivesnate quietly. George watched Chris eat his hamburger, as the youngernman looked over at Matt. There was something about Chris henwasn't able to put his finger on. He was certain that Chris wasntelling the truth about the powers he had, for he had known othernTectonese who would have those powers. But, there was something else about thenyoung man that bothered George. And weather or not Chris would tellnthem was his guess. \"What?\" Chris asked between bitesnof a burger, their eyes locking. \"I was to talk to you later. Alone,\"nGeorge said. \"About what?\" Chris took a handfullnof french fries and popped them in his mouth. They didn't make 'emnlike this any more in his time and he was enjoying it. \"Later,\" George said, his tonenwarning. \"Okay, okay.\" \"Hey, everything okay with the two ofnyou?\" Matt asked, feeling the tension. \"It is with me. I don't know aboutnGeorge,\" Chris said, taking a sip of his soda. \"Yes,\" George said quietly. Matt looked over at his partnernquestionably. \"Yes, what, George?\" George took a sip of his coffe andnlooked up. \"There is a problem, but Chris and I will discus it oncenwe get home tonight.\" After they had dropped Matt off, thendrive to George's house was quiet. Chris knew that George was goingnto ask him questions he doesn't really want to answer. When they got home, Buck was waitingnfor them, anxious to hear about Emily. \"Where's your mother?\" Georgenasked, passing by the young alien. \"Still at work, why?\" \"Good. Buck, go to your room.nChristopher and I have some things to discus,\" Not liking the demand, Buck went to hisnroom, while George and Chris went to the kitchen. George pourdnhimself a coffee and offered Chris some, who refused. Chris sat down at the table, folded hisnhands and readied himself for the twenty questions. He didn't likenthe tension, for his body was still tensed by the earlier event. After a minute of silence, Georgenturned to face the young man and sat down in front of him. The older detective sighed as he putndown his half full coffe mug on the table and looked right into theneyes of the man who resembedl Matt in so many ways. \"Christopher, I'm not here to judgenyou. I know there are some things you would much rather keep deepndown inside you, but in order for us to work together, I need to knownthings about you.\" Chris chuckled nervously. \"I'venworked with you for several days now. What do you need to know aboutnme?\" \"Well,for starters, I called thenprecient in New York and they have never heard of a Tabletop. I alsonlearned that the only Walburge in their system is a John Walburge,nthe one that was recently killed. Should I go on any further or isnthere something you like to tell me?\" \"George, the less I tell you, thenbetter off we'll be. The better I'll be, actually.\" George gulped a sip of coffee. \"Younlost me,\" \"I'm sorry, but that's all I can tellnyou.\" \"Christohper..\" \"George, just trust me. I know whatnI'm doing,\" I hope so, Chris thought deep inside. \"Do you?\" \"Pardon?\" Chris blinked. \"From what happened in that warehousenealier, I'm not so sure you DO know what you're doing. For somenreason, that man has my daughter and you're the reason why he hasnher. What is your connection with Emily and what does she has to donwith Walburge? What does ANY of us have to do with him?\" Chris sighed. This wasn't going to beneasy and he knew George wasn't going to back down. What would Georgendo if he knew who he was? \"All right, I'll tell you, but younHAVE to promise NOT to tell Matt.\" \"He's my partner. I tell himneverything,\" \"Not this, please. At least not untilnI'm gone,\" Chris almost begged. About an hour later, Buck came down tonget soemthing to drink. He saw the look on his father's face andnwasn't sure he liked it. \"Dad, what's going on?\" he askednworriedly. \"I'm not sure I understand it myself,nBuck. But, we do have to help Christopher and it's urgent.\"[Chapter 9] The next morning, Matt showed up at thenpolice department, finding his partner and Chris all ready there. Henlooked at his watch and it showed it was only six in the morning. Chris was skimming through some book asnGeorge was searching through the computer. \"Okay, guys, what's going on? Why arenyou two up and at 'em all ready?\" he asked, as he neared the two. George glanced up at him for a slightnsecond. \"We're looking for Walburg, Matthew, and he isn't easy tonfind.\" Matt sat next to Chris, who hadn't evennlooked up at him. \"That's nothing new, George. He's been hard evernsince Chris has been here.\" George nodded. \"That is correct,\" Matt looked at his partner, then tonChris. He felt something odd between the two. He folded his arms across his chest.n\"Okay, guys. Something is going on and I want to know what it is,\" Chris finally looked up at his father.nHe was beginning to feel like a broken record here. \"Don't ask, Matt. Please,\" hensighed and went back to his book. Angrily, Matt stood up and closed thenbook in front of Chris, who looked back up to him. \"I want some answers and all you'rengiving me is the run around!\" Matt demanded. He knew there was nonone at the station except for Albert and he was busy cleaning thenbathrooms at this point. This time George turned off thencomputer and stood up himself. He went to his partner and grabbednhold of the human's shoulders. \"Matthew, this won't do us any good.nWe need to help Chris and we need to do it now,\" \"Why?\" Chris could feel Matt was getting anheadache. He stood up and went to his future father. He put hisnfinger tips up to Matt's temple and closed his eyes. Matt felt the urge to push Chris'snhands away, but once he started to feel the calm sensation, hendecided not to. The warm feeling he got was amazing and wished itncould stay, but after a few minutes, Chris let go. \"Better?\" Chris asked. \"Much, thank you.\" \"Your welcome,\" Dad , wasnwhat he wanted to say. \"Well, what have we found so far?\"nMatt asked as he sat at his desk. \"We found that there IS no TonynWalburg,\" George said quietly. \"What do you mean? There's no TonynWalburg?\" Chris sighed. The reason why there isnno Tony Walburg was because Tony Walburg didn't exsist until thenmiddle of 2008. Actually, Walburg wasn't around for another fewnyears. \"Is it possible that Walburg couldnhave had a clean record before Chris came along?\" Chris looked up at his father andnalmost cracked up. Walburg had NEVER had a clean record. He and Bucknhad been after Walburg for years... Matt looked over at Chris, who had anfunny look on his face. \"What's so funny?\" \"I was laughing? I didn't know I wasnlaughing,\" \"It was your look, Chris. What is upnwith the two of you?\" Matt was getting angry. \"Matt...\" \"No, George, I want to know!\" \"I can't tell you,\" Chris said. \"He's right, Matthew. His lifendepends on it,\" \"Oh, we're talking about his lifenagain, are we?\" Suddenly, Chris heard Walburg's voicenagain. \"Good morning, Sykes! I trust you had a pleasant evening,\" George and Matt noticed the blank looknon the young man's face and knew what was going on. \" I'm going to give you anothernchance to find me, Sykes. I'm at the hotel you stayed at before yournuncle graciously allowed you to stay so that you can be safe. Inpromise, I dooo have Emily and she's very much alive. Meet me at thenlobby...this time ALONE...in one hour.\" Chris blinked hisneyes and looked at his future Uncle and Father. Without saying anword, he got up and headed for the door. It startednstorming, thunder claps so loud it shook the building and the rainncame pouring down out side. Chris didn't care about getting a jacketnor an umbrella. His mind was solely on in the intention on gettingnEmily back to saftey and getting Walburg back to their time and innjail for good. \"Chris!\" He had heard Mattncalling after him, but he didn't head to the voice. He kept walkingnand pushed the glass doors open to the pouring rain. Thankfully henremembered the hotel, so he didn't need nay directions or his fathernand uncle for help in directions. He pushed throughnthe crowd and the pouring rain. His legs couldn't carry him fastnenough to get to the hotel. All the while, he looked back, to makensure he wasn't being folloowed. THIS TIME. The hotel wasnstrange. It was empty, no one was there. If this was a fluke, he thought angrily, looking around. \"Chris...\" camenEmily's shakey voice from his left. He turned and sawnher. She was tied, hand and feet, and blind folded. But, by the soundnof her voice he could tell she had been crying. \"Emily, it'sngoing to be okay,\" he promised, his voice calm. \"Are you surenabout that, Sykes?\" Walburg's voice startled him and he turned tonface the older man. \"What is hentalking about, Christopher? Are you related to Uncle Matt?\" \"Oh, you haven'tntold anyone? I forgot! Your life would be in jeapordy if you did!\"nWalburg said. \"Shut up,nWalburg! Just come with me quietly and no one will get hurt,\" Chrisnsaid, suddenly his police mode took over. He was no longernthe young man who was working with his father and Uncle. Now he wasnin front of the man who would make him an orphan. Actually,nworse...not even being born. \"Oh, I wish itncould be that easy. But, you know I'm not an easy man, Sykes. You'llnhave to fight me to get me.\" \"You know I don'tnfight,\" Chris muttered under his breath. \"Then you cannloose your pretty alien girl friend here,\" \"Christopher?\"nEmily asked. \"It's okay, Em.nDon't worry,\" Chris tried to feel as calmly as he could. He couldnfeel anger creeping up inside him once again. \"Shall we stepnoutside, Sykes? We don't want to mess this 'pretty' hotel,\" nWalburg said. \"Sure, why not?\" Chris went over tonEmily and put his palm against her head. \"Don't worry,nyou'll be all right.\" he whispered. \"Christopher,nplease..\" she cried out as she heard him walking away. Once outside, Chrisnhad to hide all his anger. \"Why don't younget me, Sykes? I'm right here,\" Walburg chided him. \"Oh, don't temptnme, Walburg.\" \"Why not? Isn'tnthat why you came to this time erra? To get me, so I won't kill yournfather?\" \"Okay, that'snit!\" With the rainnpouring down on them, Chris brought up his arm and began to liftnWalburg. He pushed Walburgnto the wall of the other building and held him there, tempted to justndrop the man to the ground. \"Christopher!\"nhe heard Emily scream. Surprised to hearnher voice so near, he turned and saw her with George and Matt. \"Chris, thisnisn't the way to handle him!\" Matt shouted above the thunder. \"He was sent herento kill you! I can't let that happen!\" he answered, blinking thenrain that was dripping into his brown eyes. George went over tonhis future nephew. \"Then, just take him back, Christopher. Let thenpolice in your time handle it,\" Chris looked overnat Walburg, then at Matt, then at George. \"You're right, ofncourse, George.\" Chris went tonWalburg and lowered the man down to the ground. Before Walburg couldndo or say anything, Chris wrapped his arms around him. \"I've got to go,\"nChris said, shaking his head, so that he could clear his eyes. He wasn't sure ifnhe had really saved his father's life or not, so he wanted to makensure he got one good look at the man. \"I'm your son,nMatt..\" Chris shouted above the rain and thunder, just before henpushed the button on his watch. All Matt could donwas blink his eyes and looked over at his partner. \"What did hensay?\" he asked. George smiled. \"Henwas your son, Matthew.\"[Chapter 10] LOS ANGELAS, 2010 Chris still had a hold of Walburg when they arrived at the lab. He blinked when his eyes adjusted to the light of the lab. His arms were tired of holding Walburg and once he saw he was safe in the lab, he let go, his arms went limp. \"Grab him!\" Chris hollered to Buck, who quickly came to reprehend Walburg. \"Got him, Chris.\" Buck looked over at his partner and smiled. \"Welcome back, partner.\" \"Thanks. Not sure if I did my job, though.\" Chris said, his eyes beginning to water. \"What job?\" came a familiar voice. Chris whirled around. He gasped when his eyes met the same brown eyes. \"Dad?\" he said, blinking his eyes. His father was older, greyer, but it was in fact Matthew Sykes. Matthew Sykes looked over at his son and smiled. \"You saved my life, Chris, when you brought Walburg here to this time. You also saved your mother's life as well,\" \"I—I wasn't sure..\" Chris said, suddenly feeling weak. \"Well, you did, son. Are you hungry?\" Matt asked, a broad smile comes to his face. \"Starving!\" Chris answred, smiling back at his father. \"Good, cuz I'm cooking.\" came Emily's voice from behind them. Chris looks over at his partner. \"She's going to cook?\" Buck chuckled. \"Welcome back, partner!\" The family of four walked out of the lab, but not before they watched the police drag Tony Walburg to the police station..... THE END ","Summary":" JUNE, 2010 DetectivenChristopher Sykes drives his speeder with expertise.

Read, Rate, Review people...Oh...Dont sue me, nothing here is mine except my character and some possible situations...you know what I mean ;) His knee embedded into my stomach, sending me to the floor instantly. I should have been ready for it. I never was. \"I am doing this for your own good rookie. You think when you walk in this prison those men are going to be nice to you, just because you're a girl?\" \" No sir.\" I replied, trying not to hack up on the floor \" No…The minute they get you alone, they are going to rip you to shreds.\" His voice was in my ear hissing. \"They are going to slap you, kick you, grope you, anything else that will cause violence…it will happen. Get up.\" He growled. Shaky, I managed to get into standing position, my shoulder popped and my rib popped back in as I straightened. I was surrounded now, three big men, ready for me to fall at any minute, I refused to fall. \"You think because you're a woman that they will be nice to you?\" His blue eyes stared me down. \"No sir.\" I said wincing at the strong pain in my ribcage, the fact that I was still standing was beginning to frustrate him, the fact that I had managed to get back up every time he knocked me down again pissed him off to high heaven. He stepped forward intimately close to my face. His breath causing my neck to shutter. \"I am going to break you O'Shea. Then, right before you shatter, I will make sure that you call out for me.\" He turned to leave but I stopped him \"Captain Knauer…\" He turned and looked over his shoulder at me. I was going to play G.I. Jane, but this time, Demi Moore had nothing on me. \"Suck…my…dick!\" I took another lap around the team's football field, the music blaring uncomfortably loud in my ears. It was slightly before daybreak, I started early that morning. I was going to make three miles, which was my determined goal for the day. I made one more lap before slowing to a walk, putting my hands on my hips to open my lungs up for oxygen. I took a few deep breathes. Looking over my shoulder I realized that I wasn't alone. He was staring at me. I took a deep breath and decided to make one last ditch effort to end my three mile trudge. Finally half-way around the track my phone let me know \"Congratulations, you reached your goal of three miles, tap pause to end your work-out.\" \"Don't have to tell me twice.\" I replied slowing again to a stop and grabbing my phone from my pocket to shut it off. I took my earbuds out of my ears and sighed. He was still standing there, his arms crossed over his chest, a smirk permanently pasted on his face…That same smirk was there when I walked into this penitentiary I am doing this for your own good rookie . I made my way across the field and up toward the door, ripping the towel that he had for me off his shoulder \"Good morning Lieutenant.\" \"Captain Knauer.\" I replied, since we were using formalities this morning. I had earned my way to the top until I was lieutenant, which managed to piss off some of the guards that had been here longer than me. I was the last rookie of my team to stay. Even though was supposed to follow his orders right down to the 'T' there were moments that I questioned them, while he was threatened by it. I still managed to hold firm. He looked over his shoulder to me \"All moved in?\" \"As of yesterday, with some help.\" I breathed He helped me move most of my stuff into my dorm room, and even helped me unpack some. The rest of it I wanted to take care of \"I am going into town and get some groceries.\" \"We have food.\" He said \"You have food. I have a delicate stomach, and you guys eat meat and potatoes, I need chicken and avocados.\" I said stripping out of my work out gear. I had no modesty with these guys. I learned that there was no place for it when you were the only female. I turned my back on him, showing my back tattoo to him, the grand thunderbird on my back with a feather on the bottom, it was a pretty thing, a lot of people questioned it though. I stripped off my sports bra and threw it into the locker\"We have a meeting this morning with the warden.\" \"Oh yeah?\" I slipped a black bra and a white tank top, and looked over my shoulder, he had taken off his sunglasses showing me his deep blue eyes causing me to shutter. \"What's this joy about?\" \"I don't know.\" He said shifting his weight to his other leg and tapping his sunglasses against his hip. I pulled on my uniform pants, check for creases or wrinkles and finding none. My utility belt was next and my gray uniform shirt. I left it unbuttoned to let myself cool down from a run and I turned to look at him walking up close to him until we were arm's length from each other. \"Well I am sure that whatever it is, you're going to be willing and ready to kiss Warden Hazen's ass.\" He rolled his eyes \"Cara.\" He breathed. \"Oh, now we are on a first name basis…come on Brian you and I both know that you run this prison until Warden Hazen gets a hair in his ass and you go ahead and go along with it…\" \"To keep him happy. You also know that I am good at tiptoeing around him, I tell him to make him happy.\" \"I am guessing that you want me to go along with it.\" I said, mocking his Texan accent. \"Act like the perfect little southern belle.\" \"It would help.\" He said looking down at me and I grinned \"Now what kind of world would it be if I made everything easy for you?\" I knew what he was thinking but he didn't seem to reply, instead he leaned in closer to me and seemed to take in my scent. \"While would be easier, I know that it would be boring.\" He turned and walked down the hallway and I followed behind him, buttoning my uniform shirt and tucking it in. \"Do you have practice tonight?\" I asked \"Yeah, for about an hour tonight then I am off, why?\" Knauer asked. \"I need to go back to my apartment in town before I go grocery shopping…\" knowing what I was worried about, he nodded \"Yeah I will go with you.\" We walked into the office and Lynette was already parked in her seat. \"Good morning Lynette.\" I said nicely. She smiled at me \"Good morning honey. The warden is waiting for you. I am afraid to say that Mr. Dandridge is here as well.\" I frowned, I was starting to get sick of the fat old man showing up every single day. Yeah he was a publicity man and he managed the team. Knauer opened the door for me and I stepped in first \"Good morning Lieutenant, Captain.\" \"Good morning sir.\" We both said at the same time. The Warden seemed a little bit happier than he had been in the past couple of days \"I have some very exciting news for the two of you. We are receiving a new inmate tomorrow morning.\" Receiving an inmate was not new to us, so what made this any different \"I pulled a lot of strings to get him here but I think that he will be a wonderful candidate for our prison.\" Knauer and I both gave him a questioning look and warden Hazen, seeing our curiosity, smiled \"We will be receiving Paul Crewe at Eleven O'clock.\" I had to go to the back of my filing cabinet to remember who Paul Crewe was. Admittedly while I was in one of the biggest semi football team, I didn't know players, I very barely knew how to play football. Then it hit me \"The football player that shaved points off of his last football game? Why do we want him?\" \"I believe that he might be able to give us some pointers. Some great insight for each of our players.\" Hazen replied \"While the Warden's team is very good, we need a way to…spruce up the plays.\" Dandridge said. 'Thank you Sanders for giving me your input that I didn't ask for.' I thought angrily. Knauer shifted next to me. As if to tell me to cool it. \"I thought he was in the Hollywood hills not living life?\" \"He was, until he broke probation with a drunk and driving charge.\" Hazen replied \"And I pulled the strings to make it happen and sure enough, he is heading to our little corner of the world.\" My eyebrows furrowed \"I am sorry Warden but, how are you going to make sure that Crewe helps you make your team better? Maybe he just wants to do his time and go home?\" \"I leave that up to Captain Knauer.\" Warden Hazen replied I glared at him \"There is no possible way that this is legal! You're going to have Knauer just beat the shit out of him?\" \"Don't forget your place Lieutenant!\" Hazen yelled causing me to wince. \"Remember that you are just as replaceable as everyone else in this prison! The only reason that I hired you is because your daddy and I were extremely good friends. Your father, God bless him, wanted me to make sure that you are well taken care of. Now with his death, I am not afraid to cut you lose! Do you understand me?!\" \"Yes sir.\" I replied \"Lieutenant, have you finished your paramedic training for this season.\" Dandridge asked me. As I had been for the past three years, I was the teams' paramedic, receiving training when I started working here, and while I couldn't prescribe anything, I could treat wounds, fix broken bones. During the games I was the one that took care of it all, I cleaned up blood and shit constantly, this year was going to be no different I am sure. I nodded in reply \"I have to pick up my bag tonight and update some of the supplies. Captain Knauer is going with me when he gets done with practice.\" Hazen glanced at the two of us \"You two have been spending a lot of time together as of late. Is there something that I need to know?\" We both shook our head \"Because any distraction on both of your parts is cause for my foot to ram so far up your ass your ancestors will feel it. Do you two understand?\" \"Yes sir.\" We both replied \"Get out of here.\" He told us. Waving us away. As soon as we walked out and before I could start walking down the hallway Knauer stopped me. I looked up at him, a little frustrated at him \"What?\" I snapped. \"Should we give him something to suspect?\" He said pushing me up against the wall. He put his hand on the wall above my head and I glared at him \"I think you and I both know the answer to that.\" I said trying to move away from him but he held firm \"You remember how I always told you that I would break you?\" I took a deep breath, rolling my eyes \"How can I forget? You will never let me live it down.\" \"I still plan on it…Just…not in the way that you're thinking.\" \"Oh, you mean you stopped trying to beat the hell out of me?\" He gave me a famous Knauer smirk \"I stopped beating the shit out of you when you stood up to me as a rookie. No, I wanted you for more…personal reasons.\" He leaned in closer to me to get hold of the scent of my hair. Causing me to shutter but I didn't break \"If I didn't break down when you were training me, what the hell makes you think I would break down and screw you?\" He pulled back and made eye contact with me, still smiling \"Because I think, deep down in that little heart of yours, you want it just as much as me.\" I smiled, yeah deep down I did, but I wasn't going to admit it. I leaned into him, toying with him slightly. My lips barely touching his \"You might want to take a cold shower before you go to practice tonight, I heard that hard on's before sports cause major hernia's.\" I nudged away from him and began walking down the hall for morning check. Smirking. He may have been an asshole, but he might have to be my asshole.[Chapter 2] O'Shea's Struggle Chapter 2 Morning check-in I walked into the break room that morning for our guard's staff meeting, Knauer and I were the ones that got to break the news about our new famous inmate, while I wasn't looking forward to that venture; we had to get it on the table. \"Mornin Lieutenant.\" I heard Guard Holland say as I walked in \"Morning.\" I replied grabbing a cup and filling it with hot water. Green tea was my way of waking up in the morning. That was guards Lambert's excuse to give me shit \"Come on Lieutenant Grab some coffee, that healthy shit can't be good for you.\" I smirked at him \"Is it just me Lambert or have you gained a good ten pounds?\" Knauer walked in behind me and handed me the clipboard \"You forgot this.\" He replied. I took it from him and thanked him and looked at it \"Guards Dunham, Webster, Lambert, Engleheart! You are with me for morning roll call\" I bellowed above the obnoxious music that was blaring in the background, my voice sounding like an overzealous banshee. It was going to take me most of the morning. The big men stood up with me, they looked tired from their practice last night, I, however knew better than to ask. \"Turn the music off!\" Knauer yelled and it fell silent, he took a deep breath \"We are getting a new inmate tomorrow. This one is a little bit special than the others that we have had in the past. For anyone of you that have followed football you will all know him…\" \"Your shitten me? We're getting Paul Crewe?\" Malloy said over him, causing Knauer to glare at him \"Yeah…we're getting Paul Crewe.\" The guards suddenly started laughing and cutting jokes, some of them were pissed off, ready to tear the man apart and he hadn't even got to our prison yet. \"Warden Hazen wants us to use Crewe for some pointers. I am going to make sure that it doesn't happen.\" I turned my head and looked at him 'What the hell is he saying?' \"He is going to say the hell away from the football field. And you guys are all going to help me make sure that happens. Everyone understand me?\" \"Yes sir.\" They all replied Knauer nodded \"Have a good day, gentlemen, see you at practice, four o'clock.\" He looked at me one more time before taking his exit. I took my group for roll call and headed out to general population. \"Alrighty boys, get up!\" I yelled across the general population my voice echoing through the great hall. I heard grumbles, mumbles and throwing of things as I heard them stand up and the cell doors open. I took one block and assigned the guards to the others. This was going to take all morning I was sure, but hey, I didn't have to do nightly roll-call. \"Hey Lieutenant O'sheaaay.\" One of the inmates called out to me, flirting as usual. \"What can I do for you inmate?\" While most of the guards got a hard on by beating up the inmates. I was the more respectful type \"Can I get a Tylenol?\" \"What happened?\" I asked \"Man, I got this headache that is reaching into the back of my neck and down my spine.\" I put my hands on my hips and sighed \"Who hit you?\" He stepped back from the bars and I knew it was one of us. \"Which one?\" I pressed letting him know that I was on his side. \"Dunham, and Garner. He is the biggest skin head on the planet man he beats us all to hell. They both love to beat up on us.\" I nodded looking over the edge down to Dunham who saw me looking down at him. He gave me a salute. I looked back at one of the inmates and nodded \"Alright man, I will see what I can do. Alright, for now, you're clear from roll coll.\" I walked on and checked on every cell that I could. \"Alright ladies breakfast will be served in one hour! Be prepared or do not eat.\" This was the typical announcement for the day, it never changed, it was routine….this was Allenville. Inmates, Ingrates, and football. That afternoon when men were heading off for practice, I made my way down the hallway in the afternoon to check in with Lynette. I had changed into a pair of jeans, a black tank top and cardigan sweater. When I walked in, I caught her checking out the magazine article of Paul Crewe and I grinned \"Someone must be excited to see Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe.\" I replied \"Oh, honey, you have no possible idea.\" She looked at me \"You mind walking me to one of the cells? I have to give some discharge papers out.\" \"Sure. I have to wait for Captain Knauer to get off practice anyway and I still have a baton.\" I said with a smile. She smiled back at me \"You and Knauer have been spending a lot of time together. He is a very good looking boy, you have got a very good lookin man, honey, why don't you two break down and take him to the stock room.\" \"Lynette!\" I replied, honestly shocked \"What? Honey, you forget I was your age once too, I know what it was like! The tension high, the thought of him taking you in his arms…\" \"I am not comfortable.\" I replied \"I mean. I am reaaaally not comfortable right now.\" She laughed at me as I blushed and walked down the hallway a little faster \"Just think about it honey, he is willin, and I think you are too.\" By the time we both walked back to the office, Knauer was waiting for me outside of the office. He leaned against the doorway in a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt. He smiled at me \"Well hello ladies.\" \"Captian.\" Lynette said, looking at me \"See ya tomarrow honey.\" \"Bye Lynette.\" I said looking up at him \"Ready to go?\" He asked me \"Yeah, I think so.\" \"We'll take my truck.\" He said pulling his keys as we walked out of the building together. He opened the door for me and I hopped in the passenger seat. He walked over and got into the driver's seat and we took off down the road \"I take it after we stop at your apartment we need to stop at the store?\" \"Yeah, I don't have to buy very much.\" I replied, just some Greek yogurt, protein powder, chicken, and apricots.\" He nodded. Then suddenly a grin came across his face \"What?\" I asked suddenly \"Just thinking.\" \"Of?\" \"The first time you walked into my prison….You walked in a nineteen year old cocky kid thinking you were going to be the queen bee.\" \"And I walked out a little stronger of a queen bee.\" I said smugly. \"You came out a better queen bee.\" He corrected. \"I much better, and more attractive.\" I looked over at him in the driver seat \"I really appreciate you coming with me to my apartment. It's still…not comfortable.\" He looked at me for a minute, I was looking uncomfortably at the floorboard of the truck. \"Especially if he is there.\" Before I realized it, he turned into the parking lot of my old apartment \"Hey…look at me.\" I did as he said \"I trained you….but he isn't going to do anything to you, I'll kill him first.\" I took a deep breath and stepped out of the truck. If I was lucky, he wasn't going to be there, I could get in and get out. He followed behind me up to the third floor, where my apartment was. While it no longer belonged to me, I was still allowed to get in and grab any of my belongings when I needed. My clothes has slowly been moved into the apartment at the prison. The new football season had started at the same time of the divorce and the same time that my ex-husband was cheating. I guess when you work in a prison, any spouse you have can stray. My husband had been straying for a year after we got married. When I came home and caught him with my sister-in-law, that was when the beating started. Then it became more than what even I was willing to handle. Lambert one day caught me sporting a black eye and a couple broken ribs. When I was approached from Knauer, and he knew that I was truly in fear of my life. Knauer, Lambert and Engleheart went to my apartment, grabbed most of my stuff, and Engleheart threatened to beat my husband within every inch of his life. I found my paramedic back in the back of the closet, I didn't bother to pick up the mess, he left me with worse, and was taking most of what I had, my retirement and pension included. I emerged back into the living room, Knauer standing right there looking at me, tense. I nodded slightly, still a little bit terrified \"You know we can get even with him right here.\" He walked over to me, his stomach touching mine. 'way to ruin a moment Knauer, just when I was starting to respect you.' I thought, giving him a bored look \"Yeah, and how do you plan on doing that? Trust me Knauer, screwing me is not going to give me a way to get back at my hisband.\" 'Though it would be great for me.' I thought…let's just say…its been a while. He cocked an eyebrow and I sighed before I looked at him \"Just when I think you're one of the good guys, you have to go and do something completely asshole.\" I stomped on his foot \"think of it as foreplay…forever.\" I said. The door opened up and Knauer stepped back \"What the hell are you doing here?\" Mikhail, a man that would be handsome if it wasn't for his inner dick qualities, stood in the doorway, his dark hair slicked back, he wore a red silk shirt. I held up my medical bag. \"Getting this, and a couple more of my things before I head back. Sorry to say, you have no use for any of the things that I am taking.\" Mikhail's eyes glanced to Knauer \"You bring your boy-toy with you to show me what you got?\" Knauer crossed his arms over his chest but didn't reply. I shook my head \"Brian came with me for some extra security. Since apparently being alone with you has proved to be dangerous for me.\" He stepped forward which caused Knauer to become defensive \"I think you are close enough to her Mikhail.\" He looked at Knauer, trying to size him up and decided that it wasn't such a good idea. \"Fine….Get out of here.\" He replied letting me past. Knauer put his hand on the small of my back and nudged me out the door. As soon as I got back into the truck, my arms and legs began to shake with fear, and hatred \"I hate him.\" Knauer took a deep breath. \"I hate seeing you like this, every time too.\" \"I don't have a choice. That man is trying to take everything that I have! And then some!\" I put my head in my hands and took a deep breath. \"I hope that man falls into a pool of rattlesnakes, then I could at least get some sleep at night.\" Knauer didn't know what to say. He just put the truck in gear and took off down the road \"Don't worry about the damn grocery store. Just take me back to the jail.\" He only nodded. Inside I am sure that he was trying to figure out what to say. Outwardly there was nothing else to say. As soon as we got back to the prison, I unloaded the medical bag into the infirmary and told the night nurse to make sure I had everything, I was the closest thing to a doctor we had, but I made sure we had a nurse. We headed back to the apartment buildings and I looked at my watch and sighed \"I may get in another run before I go to bed tonight. Let off some steam.\" He looked at me for a minute \"There are so many other ways to let off steam. That doesn't involve you going for a run.\" For the first time since he made the suggestion…I was actually contemplating getting laid by Brian Knauer, but I wasn't going to tell him that. Instead I gave him a sly smile \"Captain, let me tell you something really personal, and then I never want to hear you make the suggestion again. I haven't been laid in three years. I might be willing to hold onto that for another thirty if you keep asking, if you ever get to screw me…it will be under my terms, my conditions and on my turf. In no way shape, form or anything else, will you break me because you have taught me everything about not breaking? So if you break me…you're going to have a hell of a time doing it.\" He chuckled and leaned into me \"I didn't teach you everything I know.\" Before I could come back with a snide comment, his mouth took hold of mine roughly for only a minute. Then he took off down the hallway. My lips were tingling, and I was officially frusterated.[Chapter 3] O'Shea's Struggle Chapter 3 I felt his rough hands run up my sides, my back arched and I cried out. His mouth kissing my skin, my thighs, my legs, my stomach, scoring every part of my body. My arms grabbed at his shoulders and I pulled him up. His hands tangled themselves in my hair and he pulled me up into sitting position, kissing my neck, to my jaw. I heard him whisper in my ear. \"Give it up rookie.\" My body melted into his chest as I looked up at his bold blue eyes. The smile that he was famous for burned itself into my brain \"Brian.\" I whispered. I jolted into sitting position in a cold sweat, breathing heavy. I looked around the room to find myself alone. \"Jesus Christ.\" I said quietly, running a hand through my drenched hair and falling back into my bed. \"Now he is taunting me in my dreams?!\" I covered my face in my hands and felt my face and the rest of my body flush. I had to spend all morning with him, which was the worst part, I wasn't going to be able to look at him without blushing. A sudden banging on my door caused me to jump \"What?!\" I yelled as the door came open \"Get up, you wanted to kick box today.\" I rolled over and threw a pillow over my head \"Go…Away.\" Garner chuckled \"No…You told me not to and I am not going to. That you were going to start kick boxing today. Get up!\" Before I could argue with him I felt a strong tug on my arm as he threw me over his shoulder. I let out a yelp but knew that it was no good \"Alright, Alright! Put me down!\" \"You going to get dressed?\" \"Yes! Just put me down.\" He gently set me down on the ground and looked at me \"Jesus, how much do you lift every day?\" I said fixing my tank top down over my stomach. I wasn't thin. Someone would say that I was curvier than most women. A size zero was not in the cards for me, ever.\" \"I don't know, how much do you weigh?\" I slapped his shoulder and we both smiled \"Get out of here, let me get dressed.\" I said tying my hair back into a ponytail. As soon as I heard the door shut I grabbed a pair of black work out pants and a black tank top. I had black hand wraps for my gloves and I whipped them out for my knuckles. It was going to be a hard work out. \"Hook. Jab. Cross! Come on O'Shea actually hit me!\" I slammed a hook into the pad. Sweat dripped down my chest into my bra. I was soaked, my arms were starting to hurt, and my legs were burning \"Jab, cross, uppercut! Weave! Break! Come on you can hit harder than that! I have seen you hit people! Jab!\" I backed up and started jump rope \"Nice job O'Shea, the Irish is really coming out in those jabs. Work on those upper cuts, you're not getting a lot of power to it.\" I cooled down and smiled \"Thanks Garner. I will.\" He took his leave as I started to strip off my boxing wraps \"Morning Captain.\" \"Morning.\" I heard Brian Knauer's voice in the background. \"Lieutenant.\" I turned around to look at him \"Captain.\" The Minute that I had actually gotten a look at him was when I could tell that something was wrong \"Brian?\" \"Do you have a key to the infirmary?\" I nodded \"Why?\" He winced slightly, then the realization came on my face \"Yeah…let me go to my room and go and get it. How long has it been bothering you?\" \"Just this morning.\" He murmured. I was the only one that knew about the back injury that he has sustained the last season. Someone hit him just right and almost broke him. He got back up and started playing again. After that he had to take a week off just to sit and not make any movements. That was right before he got a divorce, his wife and I never did get along. \"Have you been taking anything for it? Some Joint meds like fish oil?\" He made a face \"No. That shit is disgusting.\" \"Yeah well, that 'shit' might keep you from having a cartilage build up and cause you to become stiff.\" I walked into my room and grabbed the set of keys that were sitting on my chair and walked with him to the infirmary. \"Sit down and take off your shirt.\" I ordered. He smiled at me slightly \"Trying to undress me, Lieutenant?\" \"Relax, I am doing this for your own good.\" He stripped off his t-shirt and I got a look at him, it wasn't the first time I have seen him shirtless, and he never disappointed me either. The thought of his body caused me to shiver and think of the dream that I had the night before. \"Cara.\" I looked at him to see the sly smirk on his face. I shook the thoughts away \"What? I was just thinking!\" He sat down and I pressed on the lower part of his back where his pant line started \"Tell me when it hurts.\" He didn't need to as soon as I pressed on an area he stiffened up, there was a knot right near his spine and I rubbed at it \"Yeah, your extremely tense right there. I can give you a slight steroid shot that might take care of the pain.\" \"Do what you need to do.\" He said looking over his shoulder. I nodded and walked over to the cabinet and loaded up the needle \"You're going to feel some pressure, take it easy for a little bit. I am hoping this will keep you from killing our new inmate.\" I shot the needle into his back and heard his breath caught \"This should take care of it.\" He put his shirt back on and looked at me \"Thanks Cara.\" \"Brian…I am going to warn you of something, then I will never bring it up again.\" He looked me right in the eye and his eyes darkened slightly. I tensed up \"You will be able to play football this season, there is no doubt about that. I can't stop you from doing it even if you couldn't. If you don't get it looked at, then you are going to have some major issues later. I am asking you…as a coworker, and…well….\" \"Yeah….I think I got it.\" We both walked out together and I walked into my apartment to get dressed that morning. We were going to be sending Lambert and Malloy out to get the new Inmate. Which means I got the opportunity to wake the boys up, which was a challenge in itself. \"I am going for a run tonight. I want to see if that back injury is going to give you any issues. I want you to come with me.\" I said, which was a surprise to both him and I, I never invited anyone on my runs. He smirked at me \"Are you sure it isn't to get me alone. You have been doing a lot of that lately.\" \"Don't be stupid.\" I snapped slightly walking into my apartment \"You might be an asshole but where would I be if you suddenly were out of commission?\" He stopped me from closing the door and leaned against the door jamb \"You know for someone who told me to suck your dick a few years ago your awefully content being around me. I used to beat the shit out of you and you used to get back up again. I just have one question.\" I cocked an eyebrow to tell him to go on \"Why?\" I smiled \"Because if I just gave up and quit then you would have won…I can't have that Brian. I am too stubborn for that. As far as being alone with you is concerned, the fact that my body is torturing you is rather entertaining to me. The fact that I have that little thread that will unravel you at any minute; that is why.\" I heard a deep growl erupt from his throat and I winked at him \"I'll see you later Captain. I finally managed to close the door and changed my clothes. \"Lambert, I am going to warn you right now; leave the new inmate alone.\" I warned as he stepped onto the bus \"I am not going to tell you again.\" \"Lieutenant….\" \"Don't 'but lieutenant me….I mean it. You don't touch him not a hair on his head. I don't care if you did lose a bet. By the way that's what you get for betting anyway.\" Lambert and Malloy climbed into the bus and I watched the bus take off. I had a feeling that he wasn't going to touch him, but I do imagine that the inmate was going to get hurt. I made my way back into the prison and headed to the infirmary \"Lieutenant, we have a new one.\" I followed the nurse over to one of the beds and sighed \"Megget.\" \"Hey doc.\" He said with a smile. He was holding onto his rib cage. Earl Megget was one of the better inmates that I had in this prison. He was raised in a lifestyle where he was polite to the women in his life. He was polite with all of my nurses and with me. \"What happened Megget?\" \"I don't want to get you in trouble, Doc. You're too good for that.\" I sat down at the edge of his bed and gave him a determined stare. \"I am not leaving until you tell me. You will find that I can handle myself.\" He didn't reply and I was forced to start taking a guess \"Garner?\" The look on his face gave me the inclination that was exactly what happened. I sighed \"That fricken skinhead…\" \"Don't talk to him about it. I don't want to cause trouble for you.\" I smirked \"I would cause you more trouble than I would myself. Again, I can take him. No I won't say a word, instead I am going to take care of this mentally. For now, I am going to take care of you and make sure that we get you back up and running.\" I looked at him \"You're suffering from three broken ribs…He did a number on you didn't he?\" I wrapped him up and grabbed some pain pills. \"Take two of these if you feel any more pain, let a nurse know and she will take care of you…Go over the head of the guards and right to me if you have to. You understand me?\" Megget hesitated but then nodded \"Okay.\" The door opened and Engleheart walked into the room \"The new inmate is here. Knauer is on his way to go and get him.\" 'Shit.\" I murmured, \"Take Megget back to his cell…carefully!\" I warned hurrying out of the door and down the hallway. Catching Knauer as he swung his baton down across the man's shoulders. He hit the ground hard. \"Because the warden doesn't run this prison….I do. Do we understand each other?\" \"Not entirely sir.\" The new inmate said and Captain Knauer slammed the baton across his back one more time with a fwack \"Captain Knauer!\" He looked at me suddenly \"Lieutenant….\" \"How about we actually get him into the warden before you beat the shit out of him.\" Knauer yanked him up off the floor and gave him a shove into the room. I opened the office door as Knauer shoved the man into the room. Knauer looked at me \"You might want to check yourself Captain…I am fairly certain that the warden wants to look at him not covered in blood and bruises.\" \"Don't worry about it Lieutenant.\" He growled slightly We walked into his office with the new inmate in front of us. \"Well well, Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe. You have no idea how many strings that I had to pull to get you here.\" 'I can take a few guesses.' I thought. He looked over to see the same man that was always sitting in his office. I sighed in frustration, hoping that for once he would be somewhere else. \"Whoa, looks like Cornal Sanders has been eating his own chicken.\" I snickered slightly, but Knauer checked me with a slight glare. \"I pulled a lot of strings to get you here.\" \"Now why in the world would you want to do that warden?\" Crewe said \"Because believe it or not I have one of the best football teams in the league.\" \"The warden is too humble to say that the team is very good.\" \"But not good enough.\" The Warden said slightly with a little bit of irratance. Knauer took a step sideward awkwardly. \"We havent one a game in over four years, and to be honest. I am ready to pick it up.\" The warden said \"I think, with your help Crewe. You can help with that.\" Crewe looked at the warden then slightly over his shoulder to Knauer \"I havent played football in years Warden.\" \"Oh you won't be playing, you will just be there to give some pointers.\" \"I just want to do my time and go home.\" Crewe said. The look on the Warden's face gave a look of warning \"Let me tell you something, to get along, you got to go along. Captain Knauer, what do you think about Crewe helping out a little?\" \"Well, I think that it's a real good idea Warden.\" \"How about you Lieutenant?\" The warden said Captain Knauer took a step to my side and I looked at the Warden \"Do what you think is best Warden.\" Knauer looked at me and smirked, I was going to hear about it later I was sure. \"Like I said, I just want to do my time and go home.\" Warden Hazen looked at the two of us, I knew from that moment that I was going to be in trouble. \"Crewe can you step outside for a minute?\" Knauer and I went to leave \"Captain, Leiutenant, you two can stay.\" \"Shit.\" I murmured. \"Stay behind me.\" Knauer said in my ear. The door shut and that was when the Warden began to roar \"What the hell do you think you two are doing? Who do you think runs this Godamned prison! Let me tell you something the minute the two of you think that you are better than I am you're done! Get him to play! Get the hell out of my site!\" He didn't have to tell me twice. Knauer touched the small of my back and pushed me out the door. \"You two good now?\" Crewe said \"Oh yeah we're steller.\" Knauer said grabbing him by the neck and shoving him \"Leuitenant!\" He said over his shoulder I turned \"What Knauer?\" \"See you later?\" I grinned and nodded \"Yeah...See you later.\"[Chapter 4] O' Shea's struggle Chapter 4 Authors:s note: I changed the story around just a little bit That afternoon I was in the infirmary, taking inventory of medications when a guard walked into the doors \"Hey Lieutenant, I have a new one for you?\" I turned around and let out a frustrated growl when I saw the new inmate, Paul Crewe, standing in front of me. His white jumpsuit now covered in blood. Knauer had managed to beat him to a bloody pulp. \"Alright, sit down inmate.\" This was the side of Brian Knauer that I hated. I looked at the guard and glared at him \"Tell Knauer I want to talk to him. Then go and get Crewe some prison blues. I can handle him from here.\" The guard hesitated but one more look from me and he seemed to get the point. As soon as the door shut. Crewe looked at me, then gazed at the baton by my side I snickered \"Don't worry about it, I don't use this unless I need to.\" \"Are you the only woman in here?\" I snickered \"I am. But that's all they can handle.\" I said taking out the first aid kit. \"What all did he do to you?\" \"He just beat the hell out of me with the baton.\" I cleaned up his eyebrow \"You two seem close.\" My eyes set on him \"It tends to happen, we've known each other for a while.\" He looked behind me \"I bet you use that stock room for a little more than just keeping the band aids.\" The dream I had that morning went through my head. \"Even if it is Crewe, I don't think its something that you need to worry about.\" I cocked an eyebrow \"I think you need to worry about yourself. You're not too liked around here.\" \"You lose the bet too?\" \"Me?\" I asked, then started laughing \"Dear Jesus no I was sixteen when that happened. My dad was on the winning end of that bet…\" \"How nice of him.\" He said with a sigh. \"I am going to have a hard time aren't I?\" 'Well think of it this way Crewe, its only five years.\" \"Somehow lieutenant that doesn't make me feel any better.\" The door opened up and Knauer stepped through the door \"You wanted to see me Lieutenant?\" \"Yeah. Crewe, you can go.\" Crewe nodded \"Thanks Lieutenant.\" He called out before Malloy grabbed him and jerked him through the door way. I walked over and filled out Crewe's already growing medical file. \"A bruised rib, one cracked, a split eye and three chipped teeth. You beat him up harder in three minutes than the college football league did in four years.\" Knauer took off his hat and set it down on my desk. \"What can I do for you?\" He said sitting at the end of my desk right in front of his hat. Crossing his arms over his chest and leaning down to me \"You know what I am going to say.\" \"Save it, Lieutenant.\" He said with a sigh \"Why don't you use all that built up anger on something more useful.\" He implied toward the stock room and I snorted \"Even if I was in the mood, I wouldn't settle for the medical stock room.\" I stood up and walked over to the cabinet \"I am going to tell you as many times until you hear it; Lay off Crewe. Or you're going to find karma biting you in the ass.\" I turned to find him right behind me \"What will you give me if I do?\" I smirked \"I will come up with something.\" I said walking around him and handing him his hat \"Still on for tonight?\" \"Always.\" He said. Putting his hat on and walking outside…'Good looking man.' I thought 'I may be able to use him.' I met him by the outside of the prison gates. Knauer was waiting for me with a grin on his face. \"Well, never would have thought that you would have looked so good in work-out cloths.\" For some reason, my mouth opened up and the words fell out \"Well, let's see if you can earn what's under them.\" Then I pushed myself to start jogging with him right behind me. I put my ipod in my pocket and put one earbud in my ear. \"I'm feeling sexy and free Like glitter's raining on me You're like a shot of pure gold I think I'm 'bout to explode I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there Don't you know? You spin me out of control Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We can do this all night Damn this love is skin tight Baby, come on Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Boom me like a bass drum Sparkin' up a rhythm Baby, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Rock my world until the sunlight Make this dream the best I've ever known Dirty dancing in the moonlight Take me down like I'm a domino Every second is a highlight When we touch don't ever let me go Dirty dancing in the moonlight Take me down like I'm a domino I looked over my shoulder to see Knauer still behind me but starting to slow down. I grinned \"Come on old man, you want me, show me.\" I heard a slight growl erupt from his throat. I was going to toy with him. He had done it with me for the past couple of years, now it was my turn. I picked up the pace and bolted down the road with him right behind me. You got me losing my mind My heart beats out of time I'm seeing Hollywood stars You strum me like a guitar I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there Don't you know? You spin me out of control Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We can do this all night Damn this love is skin tight Baby, come on Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Boom me like a bass drum Sparkin' up a rhythm Baby, come on!

I slowed to a stop and looked over my shoulder to see that Knauer was still holding on. I waited for him to catch up and I grinned at him \"You're doing pretty good for an old guy.\" I said. He was older than me by a few years. He smiled \"You will find that I am very determined when it comes to something that I really want.\" He pushed himself up against me, his face inches from mine. We were both covered in sweat. As he had a hold of me I couldn't help but smirk, he may have run the prison but at that moment, I had a hold of him. \"You look beautiful covered in sweat.\" He whispered \"Do I?\" I asked half teasing, half honestly. He nodded, his face inching closer to mine. His own scent was intoxicating musk and ember. His mouth moved toward mine, but I moved back. \"Then let's see if you can hold back a little more.\" I said, pushing away from him and starting to run back to the prison. He was going to have to keep up with me. Though I was getting tired. When we got back to the prison; I headed back into the apartments, but Knauer stopped me \"Walk with me.\" I couldn't help but be a little bit curious, so I did. We walked along the track as he spoke to me. \"I am going to keep Crewe from helping us. I don't want his help. I don't want this inmate to run the prison the way that the Warden is about to allow.\" I sighed \"Beating the hell out him isn't the way to do it. I am afraid that it's going to cause trouble if you do…it already had slightly.\" Knauer looked down at me \"it sounds like you care.\" In a way, I did. I nodded but didn't speak, instead I just looked him in the eye. \"I am not going to encourage you to beat the shit out of the inmates. I am, however, going to ask that you persuade them.\" He nodded and with that I walked into the apartments to my room to take a shower. I hated lunch duty, I was the only one that was allowed to give out the medications for that afternoon. Knauer was standing right behind me \"Do I have any more to give out?\" \"Nope, you can start packing them up.\" \"How ya doing Leiutenant?\" I looked at the skinny black man and smiled \"Well hello Mr Caretaker, I am doing just fine. How are you doing today?\" Though I knew what he was about to do. 'Well, I am going to tell ya Doc, I am not feeling so hot.\" I looked back down as I was loading up the medicine bottles \"Oh yeah? Whats going on?\" \"Well, Doc, I have a headache.\" \"Another headache? That makes the third one this week Caretaker. Is this one the blinding headache you had, or was this the small crick in your neck that went down to your spine.\" \"You know something, its just the all over kind of headache.\" He said. I knew what he was going, he was trying to get some paid medications. I grinned at him as the lightbulb went off \"Well let me tell you, which sounds like you need a chiropractor. I know. Captain Knauer happens to be one hell of a Chiropractor, why don't you ask him to take a look.\" Knauer stepped forward and Caretaker held up his hands in surrender: No, you know what? I think I'll be alright.\" He made a quick retreat and I was left with a smile \"Alright Captain, I am all packed up, lets head out.\" He nodded \"Start walking and I'll be right behind you.\" I headed down the walkway of prisoners eating their lunch for the morning when I overheard that Crewe had made a friend. Caretaker had picked up the ex football star. \"So, Caretaker whats the deal with Captain Knauer and the Lieutenant?\" \"The two of them have worked together for a while. I think there is something else going on in that stock room besides they are just working buddies.\" \"She has the ass for it.\" I looked over my shoulder and Knauer smirked, he was thinking the same thing. He was starting to bother me...As soon as he walked me out of the lunch room. Knauer told me to get something to eat \"I will be right up if you want some company.\" \"Maybe I will.\" I climbed up the stairs before my phone rang. I looked at the I.D and sighed \"What do you want?\" \"You didn't pay your end of the restitution?\" My ex husband was a real dick. The fact that he was boinking his lawyer when I lost in the divorce case was the biggest pain. I got my divorce, but had to pay an unfair price. \"You haven't gotten a job yet? I made your payment when I picked up my shit. You also got my apartment you piece of shit.\" \"Don't think just because you work in a prison your protected honey.\" I glared at the phone for a minute \"You making threats against a prison officer? I would love to see you try and get past these guys you little shit! I made your payment! Look on the goddamned counter! Along with my ring, and three years of my fucking life!\" Before I could really tear into him one of the gaurds came running out of the room \"Lieutenant, we got a problem.\" I turned and looked to see Lambert \"Crewe started a fight with one of the other inmates and there was a fight. We have a bunch hit by a hornets nest. Knauer sent Crewe to the hot box.\" I dropped my phone and grabbed my first aid kit. \"Goddamnit Knauer.\" ","Summary":" Lieutenant Cara O'Shea is the only one willing to stand up to Knauer especially when he agrees to W"},{"Movie":"Longest Yard","Title":"The Best Damn Thing","Author":"oh.look.its.me","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536254","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Best Damn Thing . The Longest Yard I was framed. How could anyone actually believe that a girl could pull something like that off, alone? Really. What woman in their right mind would trash a mall and shoot five guys all in one night? That's exactly what they said to me in court though; they said I wasn't in my right mind. That I had gone mad. Said I needed to be locked up in a jail far off from others, one which already contained insane people. And by people I mean, men. That's right, they sent me to a men's prison. So right now that's where I'm headed, to the Allenville Penitentiary prison in Texas. In a big bus all alone, with a couple of guards in the seats in front of me, cuffs on my hands and ankles. What did they think I was going to try and get away? Where the hell would I go? Out the window? I have my ex-boyfriend to thank for this really. But who can really even consider him a boyfriend? What guy would frame their girlfriend for something they did? A mental one that's who, really I think I need a better taste in guys. But let's face it, I'm only human and I thought Brad was good for me. Clearly, I was wrong. \"Get up.\" I had been staring at the seat in front of me, lost deep in my thoughts. Hadn't even noticed we had stopped. I looked up from the torn seat and to the guard who was now smirking at me. I stood, simply giving him a look that would be hard to read. He forced me away from the seat, and into the bus isle. He pushed me along to the front; I glared at the next guard waiting at the exit. \"Welcome to your new home.\" The one in front of me said looking me up and down. My face scrunched up into a disgusted look. Sick. I walked carefully down the stairs of the bus, carefully jumping off the last one to the ground. I landed gracefully and the guards stepped out after me. \"This way…\" One said, putting his hand on the small of my back and guiding me to the entrance. I let out a disgusted sigh, and let him push me along the dirt path to the front gate. He showed me all the way to a dimmed hallway with a few doors here and there. We walked along the hall to the door at the very end. It was the warden's office that much I could tell. What I had to do in there, I didn't know. There was another guard standing there waiting for us. Now I'll admit; this guard… He wasn't as bad looking as the first couple. He was actually attractive… once you got past the sneer pasted on his face. We stopped in front of him, and the guard that took me there nodded to the other and then walked off. I followed him with my eyes, watching where he went. Then returned my gaze to face the man in front of me. He looked me up and down, but not in the same way which the first guard had. It was different, more careful as if he were secretly worried in how I would react. At least… that's what it looked like to me. \"Captain Knauer.\" He simply said. I nodded, looking straight into his eyes; his bright blue eyes. He opened the door to the office and motioned for me to enter, so I did. I entered a small room with a secretary desk, and an old lady with reddish hair sitting at it. She smiled happily, and waved a small hello. I smiled back with a quizzed look on my face. Why was she so happy to be receiving another inmate? \"Go on in.\" She simply said, and so I entered the next door leaving Captain Knauer there. Once I was inside the room, the door was shut behind me and I looked around. There was a big man with gray hair and a beard sitting in a chair while fanning himself. And another tall man with a bald head and an old looking face sat in the chair behind the desk. He was waiting? \"Miss Charlize Jacobs.\" He said looking me up and down. Rolling my eyes I nodded my head. \"A pleasure to have you here…\" He continued, \"I am Warden Hazen, and you… You are my only girl criminal. The first I've ever had to receive, but when they told me I would be receiving a woman in my prison I was eager to say yes. I figured my guards could use something nice to look at.\" He said with a short smirk. My eyes narrowed and I felt the urge to slap the warden across the face. But I knew better… that would only make my stay here worse. I could tell by the look on his face that he was testing me, and he was amused by the fact that I hadn't lashed out on him. I had just given him the satisfaction of knowing full well that he was the boss and there was nothing I could do about anything he said. \"One of my guards will show you to your cell, and around the prison.\" He said. I nodded and my thoughts began to wander to what it was going to be like as the only woman in the prison. I shuddered a bit, thinking of all the nasty men staring at me. The Warden seemed to notice this and he laughed a little and I could tell he knew exactly what I was thinking. \"My guards will keep a close eye on you.\" He assured. Oh yeah, that made me feel much better… \"Now… out of my sight.\" He ordered and I began backing out of the room. I slowly turned around, and got out of there as quickly as I could. Shutting the door behind me, I saw the secretary still sitting at her desk. She smiled at me again. \"Captain Knauer is waiting for you.\" She said pointing out the door. I nodded and gave her a brief smile and exited the room. I walked out slowly, watching my feet carefully trying not to trip on the cuffs that held my ankles together still. I bumped into something big, and noticed another pair of feet in front of me. I looked up quickly and met those beautiful blue eyes again. \"S-sorry…\" I stuttered out, and took a couple steps back only to trip from the cuffs I had been watching seconds earlier. As I began to fall backwards, the Captain reached out and grabbed my waist. He steadied me and his hands lingered there for what seemed like long minutes, before they jerked away. \"Let me get those.\" He stated, and reached for a set of keys in his pocket. He knelt down to the ground and unlatched each cuff from my ankles. He then stood reaching out to my hands. He released each from my wrists and set them on a random table in the hall. \"So should I show you your cell?\" He asked staring down at me. \"Be my guest.\" I said, not fully recovered from his touch. He nodded, and a short smile reached his lips and he began walking away from the Warden's office. I quickly followed suit, now able to walk normal without the cuffs attached to me. Before we went to the cells he showed me around a bit. He showed me important places like the cafeteria, the lounge, outside places, the library. And most importantly the guards football field… they had a football team for the guards and they practiced all the time. He told me about the warden's love for football. Lastly he took me to the cells; there were about three levels full of prison cells plus some. On the way there, I got some really disgusting stares and some whistles and even some smirks. It was disturbing in so many ways, but I had the Captain with me. And not one convict came near me. Not one made any move to touch me at all. Captain Knauer made me feel safe. Once we reached where my cell was, I saw that it was right smack in the middle. Figures… He offered an apologetic smile, \"Well here you are. I have to leave you now…\" He trailed off. \"Thanks.\" I sort of mumbled. He nodded, it was no big deal. He had probably shown a hundred convicts to their cells before, some more forcefully then others. \"Don't worry… I'll keep a close eye on you and anyone that comes near you.\" He replied and nodded once more and then took off. I watched him leave, and he got many glares on his way out. Most of those glares turned their gaze directly towards me once the Captain had gone. And those glares… they turned into smirks. As one convict made to get up, I quickly backed away not taking my eyes off him. I walked all the way to the other exit, and bumped straight into someone. I turned around quickly, letting a small scream escape my lips. I hadn't expected that at all. The man turned me around, and as I went to scream again a strong hand covered my mouth which only made me want to scream louder. \"Shhh! It's okay.\" He said calmly, and released his hand. I looked up to find a tall black man. He was rather skinny and had real short hair. He towered over my small frame. He smiled down at her; it was a friendly smile as if he was saying that he wasn't going to hurt her. I returned my own, small smile. \"They call me Caretaker.\" He said, reaching a large hand out to me. \"They call me Charlie.\" I replied, taking his hand and shaking it. His grip was strong, but friendly. It made me feel like he could be trusted, and that I would be safe with him. We released hands and he let out a laugh. \"What are you doing here?\" He asked kindly. \"More like, what are you doing here? You're too nice.\" I replied smugly. He just shrugged. \"In the truth, I didn't really do what I'm about to say… I trashed and robbed a mall, and shot five guys.\" \"Oh shit, no way.\" He sounded shocked, and a bit scared. \"Like I said already, I didn't do it.\" \"Then why are you in here?\" \"All the evidence led to me. And I was at the crime scene. They had no other suspects and no matter what I told them, it didn't matter because everything still led to me.\" I stated simply. \"In short… I got framed.\" \"Ouch…\" He replied, with a sympathetic look. I shrugged; it wasn't that big a deal anymore. At this point, all that mattered was the fact I didn't have to face my ex-boyfriend. \"So now you're the only woman in this place…\" I nodded. Good thing I was tough. \"Well, I'll be sure to have your back.\" A ringing noise was soon heard, seconds later. \"Come on, it's dinner.\"[Chapter 2] The Best Damn Thing . The Longest Yard We walked to the cafeteria. I got more stares than I've ever had in my life. And Caretaker, I'm sure, got more glares of death than he probably could ever imagine. But he stayed with me, he kept people away, and he helped me choose which food was better than others. He led me to a table consisted of only a few people. In a high school cafeteria, the table would be the loser table. But I didn't care, for two reasons. One; this wasn't high school and two; the less men around me, the better. He took a seat, and I sat down next to him. \"You know, I heard rumors that Paul Crewe is here.\" Caretaker stated randomly. I quickly looked up from the disgusting food, and before I could say anything as if right on queue everyone around us got quite, and then all over the place you could hear the rudest remarks ever. We looked over and there he was. Paul Crewe. He walked around, searching for a place to sit. \"Yo football…\" Caretaker started and got his attention, \"Take a seat.\" Paul walked over and sat down across from us. I watched him the entire time, practically staring. I could hear Caretaker talking, but my mind didn't register what he was saying. I was too preoccupied. Paul's eyes caught my gaze, and I looked to my food. \"Caretaker\" He said, reaching his hand out to Paul, who looked at it and then reached up his own to shake. \"Paul Crewe.\" He stated, even though we already knew that. \"And this here is Charlie.\" Caretaker said, nudging me with his elbow. I looked up, and caught Paul's eyes again. A tiny smile crossed my lips as he nodded his head in acknowledgement. \"Hey.\" I said rather quiet from my usual voice. It wasn't everyday that a girl met their football hero. But some hero he turned out to be… Caretaker began talking again and I didn't manage to catch any of it. I couldn't take my eyes off of Paul. I heard something about the things that Caretaker could get him. \"What about the love of a beautiful woman?\" Paul asked rather sarcastically, but still his gaze crossed over to me for mere seconds. \"Well you're gunna have to lower your standards on the beautiful part… And on the woman part…\" Caretaker replied, \"Unless you count Charlie here…\" He nudged me again, and then nodded over to a table full of transvestites. When Paul looked over, they all waved flirtingly. I shuddered slightly, and zoned thinking about how horrible it was to be the only girl here, the only real girl that is. \"…Or you'll end up somebody's bitch.\" Caretaker finished what he had been saying. \"Don't want that… Thanks for the advice.\" Crewe said and then got up and left. \"What's he doing?\" I questioned as I watched him walk over to some guy and say some things and then hit him over the head with a tray. Then a huge fight broke out, everyone in the room began to fight. Be it with Crewe or anyone else. Caretaker looked up to the guards, \"Hornet's nest!\" He yelled loudly, and he ducked down under the table while pulling me down with him. Suddenly, tons of pebble like things was flying around the room nailing many people in the face. Caretaker and I were under the large table, he had his arms around me, protecting me from the hornet's nest. A few seconds later and everything settled down, and the room was quiet. \"Everybody stay down!\" A guard yelled loudly as they all seemed to enter at once. \"And stay quiet!\" Another added in. Then Captain Knauer entered, he walked over to where Paul was laying on the ground. I got up from my position on the ground, Caretaker following suit. We crouched next to the table, peeking over to where the guards were. \"Come on Crewe, get up!\" The Captain commanded, \"Get up superstar.\" Paul obeyed and got up, \"Yes sir.\" He said dusting himself off. \"You think you can do anything you want around here… Well you are no different from any other piece of shit that calls this place home…\" \"Really… These guys think you're a dumb redneck too?\" He said smartly. The room broke out into a simple laugh, but quickly quieted down mere seconds later. I looked to Caretaker, who had a smile on his face. I shook my head; Paul was just setting himself up for trouble. Captain Knauer pulled back and swung his stick up strongly to hit Crewe in the face. But he caught it mid-swing. A gasp came out of my mouth, what was he doing? \"You better cut that shit out, it's getting old.\" The Captain did not look happy after that. \"That's gunna cost ya.\" He simply replied. \"Looking forward to it…\" Crewe said with a slight smirk. The captain retreated and I honestly thought that Paul was safe. But I was wrong. As Captain Knauer exited, one of the other guards pulled back his fist and knocked Paul out cold with one hit. I gasped for the second time that minute, and it was over. That was that. Next thing I heard was that Crewe was in the hotbox. A week later, there were rumors that he was out.[Chapter 3] The Best Damn Thing . The Longest Yard Over that week, Caretaker became my best friend. He was like a brother to me, he kept most of the disgusting men away from me, and well at least he tried most the time. Like I said, he was rather skinny. Not very tough compared to some of the other cons in the prison. We usually just kept to ourselves, and stayed away from things that could cause trouble. Today, I had been reading in the library. Caretaker had said he was going to help Paul Crewe with some kind of football tryouts. He was supposed to assemble a team of cons to play a game against the guards. I wasn't planning to show up until later, or I might be tempted to actually tryout. Yes, I know how to play football. And believe it or not, I'm actually a really good wide receiver. I'm a fast runner, so when I was younger I used to play football and I was set as the speed wide receiver. I sat alone at a table in the library, I had finished the book I was previously reading and had already returned it to its place on the shelf. I sat there staring out the window that was placed in front of me. From there I had realized that I could see the field in which Crewe's football try outs were to take place. And what I saw was pitiful. There were all kinds of losers doing the things that Paul had set up for the tryouts. They were all really uncoordinated and couldn't play if their life depended on it. Out of all the guys who showed up, there were about two that actually had some potential to be a help. I shook my head, and got up from my seat and started on my journey down to the field. Once I finally got down there, I saw the group ready to play a scrimmage. Surprisingly enough they actually looked like they knew how to play. But once Paul was hiked the ball, chaos took over. The group just started attacking each other, and no one even bothered to try to get open for a pass. I stood there in shock of what I was looking at; I had to sit down on the stairs by a walkway. I sat there watching the fights continue as Caretaker tried to break things up, and Paul stood there in disbelief. Once they were done, everyone began walking back passing me on the stairs. \"Hey girl…\" Caretaker said as he walked up just before Paul. Caretaker treated me like a sister now; it was nice to feel welcomed by him. \"Charlie…\" Paul trailed as he looked at me sitting there; he came over and sat down next to me. Caretaker took a seat as well. \"How's the team coming?\" I questioned even though the answer was pretty obvious. \"We're gunna suck.\" Caretaker began. \"Yeah… No doubt about it.\" Paul agreed. \"You need guys who can play; you have to get some of the more violent convicts…\" I stated, and went to get up. \"Catch ya later.\" I told them both; I gave Caretaker a hug from behind him and looked to Paul after. I caught his eyes, and it felt like hours before we looked away. It was some connection we had, and then I turned around to walk off just as I heard someone else approach them.[Chapter 4] The next day, Caretaker told me they had met Nate Scarborough. I couldn't believe what I had heard. He told me I better believe it, and if I wanted to see for myself then I should come to the practice they had later. I didn't get to go. I was called to the warden's office. He wanted to see me. So I was dragged off with one of the Guards. He escorted me to the Warden Hazen's office. Once we got there, I stepped inside. The secretary lady smiled at me again and waved, as I walked past her and entered the office. Lately I had been feeling like his guards were watching me way too closely, and this meeting would probably give me the answer as to why. \"Warden Hazen? You wanted to see me?\" I asked when I entered the room. He spun around in his chair to face me. \"Yes… Miss Jacobs. I've heard that you're real close with Mr. Crewe and his friend. Is that correct?\" \"Actually, sir, I'm not all that close to them.\" I lied. \"I see it differently. Now, I have something I want to ask of you…\" He paused, \"I want you to attend the team's practices, and then report to me after each one. I want to know what goes on with the inmate's team.\" I shook my head. I couldn't do that; I couldn't betray them like that. \"I assure you, that I can make your time here a lot better if you do this simple task.\" \"Sir, no disrespect… but I cannot do that.\" I responded. He frowned. So I repeated, \"I can't do it, sir.\" \"You'll change your mind soon enough…\" He trailed off. \"Get out.\" He ended sternly. I jumped and almost ran out of the room. Not even looking to the secretary sitting there. I ran all the way out, still jogging back to the prison. I wasn't looking where I was going, which wasn't a very good idea on my part. I ran straight into someone, almost toppling over to the floor. But I was steadied by a pair of strong arms. \"Shit… I'm sorry!\" I apologized looking at the person that had just saved me from falling probably flat on my face. Just my luck, it was Paul. He looked down at me with a shocked expression on his face. Soon enough the shock turned into amusement. \"Hey… no worries…\" He trailed off, his arms still wrapped around me. When he realized this, he immediately let go. I tried not to show my sadness as I stared into his dark eyes, it was hard to deny that I had developed sort of a liking to Paul. Sure, he was a jerk most of the time and it really didn't seem like he cared for much but I didn't care either. \"How'd the practice go?\" I questioned, not wanting to part ways with him just yet. \"Where were you?\" \"I got caught up in the warden's office.\" \"What did he want?\" He questioned with a hint of disgust. \"It doesn't matter…\" I answered and stepped closer to him to distract him from the conversation. I didn't want to explain what the warden had wanted; I wasn't even going to tell Caretaker. My distraction worked, instead of pursuing the conversation he took a step closer to me and we were almost touching. His eyes stared down at me, and for a brief moment I thought I saw him look to my lips. Just as I was going to give in and just kiss him, he mumbled something about leaving and walked away toward the warden's office. I let out an exaggerated sigh as soon as he was out of sight, and I continued on my way. I decided I wasn't hungry and I headed to my cell to relax. I wasn't angry or really even that shocked about what had happened. In fact, I didn't even really think about it all that much. A week passed and I still hadn't joined in watching one of their practices. I was too afraid to be seen there. I didn't want the warden to get what he wanted, a huge victory over the cons for his guards. I knew Crewe's team was getting better, especially with the help of Nate Scarborough and of course the fact that they had gotten better players now. I had so far avoided all questioning from Caretaker of why I haven't kept him company at their practices. I usually changed the subject or told him I was reading a great book. He understood when I didn't want to talk, and it was easy to get him to let it go. Eventually, I was dragged to a practice though. Apparently they had snuck into the records of every convict and found the violent convicts and recruited a lot of them. So I was forced to see them for myself. So there I sat in the crappy bleachers they had, watching their practice. They definitely had strong and aggressive players, along with a lot of duds. But mostly they needed speed; Paul kept getting sacked because no one was open to receive the ball. So we headed to the basketball courts. The only place we could to find the speed the team needed. I tagged along because, well honestly, because I wanted to. But I wished I hadn't. Crewe challenged the leader of the group to a one-on-one game and he was getting beat up all over the place. I had to resist the urge to cry out every time he got hit. Of course I knew he could take the hits, he played football after all. But it was still hard for me to watch. And even after all of that, he only got one guy of the basketball group to play. His name was Megget and he was fast. ","Summary":" The Best Damn Thing . The Longest Yard I was framed.

And if you plan on acting out and getting yourself in a tussle with the law? Be prepared. The law was hard, swift, and strong. It would come down on you like a large cement brick. Which was exactly what a man like Anthony Hazen liked and why he ran his facility with an iron grip. It was the way he was raised. Born and bred in Texas, Anthony Hazen was a true Texan ranger (Or so he would say) that many people either respected or feared. He was like God in his prison – his law, his way, or nothing – and nobody had the balls to stand up to him if they disagreed with anything h choose to do. He was that kind of man. So even though this was how it was, he couldn't help but be annoyed and perplexed over how him and his younger brother Charlie Hazen could be so fucking different. \"More tea, Anthony?\" Charlie asked as Anthony's sister-in-law Janet Hazen sat down a freshly made pitcher of Texas sweet tea. Anthony gave his best polite smile and reached for the pitcher to pour himself a fresh glass before sitting back and looking at his brother and in-law, both dressed simple but presentable. Behind them was their four story home. Charlie had suggested they have a small lunch out on the gazebo. The flowers were in bloom and a man cleaned the pool. Anthony's eyes traveled from the man to a still figure lounging out on a chair. An expensive looking pair of sunglasses were propped on her face, a sunbathing hat on her head, and wearing a red two piece, strapless top bikini. iPod ear-buds played loud music as she sat up and applied tanning lotion to her arms and legs. She glanced up, seeming to feel his questioning gaze, and gave him a resemblance of a wave, before leaning back and taking in more of the sun. \"I thought she was off in New York?\" Anthony asked, looking back at his brother. Charlie looked over at where Anthony's gaze had been, before calling out, \"Emma! Come and say hi to your Uncle Anthony!\" Anthony give a small twitch of a smile. Charlie had their fathers loud voice down to a T. If he didn't have their mothers faults about him, he'd have fit right in at working a prison. Anthony heard a shuffle behind him. \"Yeah, daddy?\" a soft but carrying female voice asked as Anthony smiled and looked behind him to see Emma. She was looking more and more like her mother. Sandy blonde hair, blue-green-eyes, sun-washed skin, and smile where her mothers. She only had Charlie's nose and firm hands. And apparently she'd inherited the Hazen side's drive for law enforcement. Charlie smiled as he gave his daughter a one armed hug, before Emma bent down and was given a soft kiss on the cheek by her mother. \"Your Uncle Anthony's here. He took time away from that prison of his to stop by and have a lunch with us!\" Charlie grinned as Emma's features perked up at \"prison\". She turned to him with her blue-green eyes and smiled. \"Are you still working at Allenville?\" she asked, taking a seat on the other side of her Uncle, a towel wrapped around her waist for some decent covering. Anthony wiped at his mouth – having just finished eating his pasta – before answering. \"Of course. I worked hard in obtaining my position. What about you, Emma? What are you doing down from New York?\" he asked, interested. Emma had headed off to Harvard to work towards being a lawyer. Since she was six she'd shown a firm interest in law. Instead of playing dress-up or doing tea-parties, she was having her Barbie dolls and stuffed animals stand trial. Charlie had sent a home video recording of Emma – about seven – arresting her stuffed bear with child handcuffs. She was a chip off the Hazen block alright. \"Well,\" Emma began, pushing her hair out of her face as a rare breeze caught them all, \"I finished up at Harvard and realized that while I may now be a graduated lawyer, I have no real understanding of the Texas law form. I plan to be the best Texas has to offer – making sure everyone gets their just – but I can't do so unless I know what I'm up against. So,\" she chirped, straightening herself, \"I called down and asked mama and daddy if I could live with them until I finish up my online courses for the University of Texas Law. But seeing you here, I feel complied to ask a very serious and huge favor.\" Anthony raised a brow, but sat up straight and crossed his fingers together. She was good. She gave idle chit-chat while still getting to the point. Good. That would get her somewhere. \"I'm all ears,\" he said, waving his arms out and allowing her to continue. She gave a thankful smile. \"I have thought this over, and I believe that the best way for me to get closer to the system and to get a view of the judicial system is for me to get closer to it. What I want to ask,\" she said, drawing it out just slightly for emphasis, \"is if I may, for the rest of this summer that is, work at your facility?\" Anthony's eyes widened slightly and his posture became almost rigid. Emma seemed to catch this, and quickly went on before Charlie could step in. \"I do not mean as a guard. I understand you probably – no you most likely do – have enough men for that. No, I mean as perhaps a secritary hand or even a cook or librarian or anything that would be suitable. I am simply wishing to be in your facility to observe on my own, uncle.\" Emma folded her hands on the table as she finished. Janet, who had been quiet up until this point, sighed. \"We've tried to talk her out of this, Anthony. Heaven knows I don't want my prescious at some con infested hole in the middle of Texas,\" she sniffed, ignoring the insulted look Anthony gave her, \"but she insists and in the end it is up to you and her, I suppose. She is twenty-five...\" Janet trailed off, the mention of her daughters age seeming to have left a bitter taste in her mouth as she scrunched up her nose and pursed her lips. \"And what about you, Charlie?\" Anthony asked, knowing his brother possibly had his own opinion on the matter. Charlie took a drink of his tea and gave a soft shrug of his broad shoulders. \"While I myself am also not keen on my baby girl waltzing around your facility, I realize that is is your facility. If anyone could give her the experience she seeks while also making sure she stays safe, it's you brother,\" he stated, reaching out to pat his daughter's leg, \"it's up to you two.\" Anthony went silent, taking on a thoughtful look. While he did not disagree with Charlie's statement of being able to keep Emma safe, he was not so sure about letting a woman around his facility. Sure there was his secretary Lynette Grey, but she was always at the office where the guards would watch the cons and where she was safe behind her desk and away from the cons. But thinking of Lynette, Anthony realized that she was getting older. She'd been there back in his guard days – having just started two years before him – and he hadn't had it in him to fire her. She was getting old and scattered, sure, but she still did her job with a smile and enthusiasm that he wouldn't have gotten out of any new girl. He leveled his gaze with his niece and laced his fingers tighter and propped his elbows on the table. \"Inside my prison I make the rules. To get along you have to go along, Emma. I wont tolerate any disobedience from anyone – inmate, guard, or even family – understand?\" he asked, watching Emma give firm nod of understanding. He lowered his locked fingers and continued to give her a stern look. \"If you can assure me that you will be on your best behavior and do as I say when I say it – no questions asked – then I am willing to consider this favor.\" Emma sat up straighter and gave her best business face and looked him in the eye. \"I will do as you ask, Uncle. I will behave, I assure you. The last thing I want is to cause trouble. I am only there to watch and learn. What better way to learn about the law than from the other side of it?\" she mused absently to him, to witch he gave a slight twitch of the lip. She understood. Good. That was what he needed. \"Alright,\" he said, lowering his still laced hands to his lap and smiling, \"you can come. My secretary Lynette could use some help with organization and I'm sure there are some safe odd jobs I can give you.\" He almost chuckled at the large beaming smile Emma gave him as she held out her hand and thanked him. After that Hazen excused himself to head back to Allenville. He would be back in two days to pick her up. The family said their goodbyes as he slid into his car and drove off. As soon as he was out of sight of the large mansion of a house, he pulled out his cellphone and made an important call. \"Lynette. Inform Captain Knauer that I would like a word with him in my office as soon as I return.\" R & R Plz[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own The Longest Yard . At All. I do not own any music or device mentioned. None of it. I do, however, own any new characters that pop up in this story. They are mine. Therefore, please ASK ME before trying to use. Thanks ^^ Authoress Note: This piece takes place just about a few weeks before Paul arrives to Allenville. I am going to do my best to make this enjoyable and readable. I did not do so hot on my first fic for this awesome remake of a classic (total Mary-Sue BS man.. Ugh. It hurts to try and reread it lol). So I will be pushing to make sure this comes out better and less painful for me to reread lol. Extra Note: Ah. Nothing helps you write another chapter like rewatching the film a few times and jumping around to favorite parts and looking for extra stuff to add. I am really getting into making this right for you all. I sure hope you'll be willing to help me out by giving me opinions (beside pointing out that I possibly have major spelling and grammer errors all over the place) to make this piece worth y'alls time. And please leave your opinions on Emma if you have any – good or bad – because I'm working my best to keep her from annoying you all. Also the songs I listened to while writing this were Let's Go by Lil Jon, She's Gone Country by Alan Jackson, Paradise City by Guns n Roses, Welcome to the Jungle by Guns n Roses, and Sing for the Moment by Eminem. April 22nd, 2005 Take me down/ To the paradise city/ Where the grass is green/ And the girls are pretty/ Take me home/ Just a' urchin/ livin' under the street/ I'm a hard case-! Guns n Roses played from the radio as Emma stared out the back seat of the Ford Taurus. She sat behind the passenger seat where an employee, a guard – Office O'Connor – drove her and her Uncle down the dirt road. The heat was intense outside of the car. Emma could see it ripple the air in the distance wherever she looked. Whoever had built Allenville had known what they were doing. Placing a prison out here in the desert was brilliant. \"O'Connor turn that down,\" her uncle ordered as on their left they passed a trailer labeled \"Panhandle Cafe\". His glasses were on as he read though a manilla folder. She couldn't see what was inside, but she was certain it was something to do with election numbers or football. Those were her uncle's biggest interest. He was planning on running for governor next year and was always doing his best to make sure his football team could become number one. Emma was not a huge football fan. In high school and college she had simply gone to the games to check out the guys and maybe go to a few after game parties from time to time. Otherwise she didn't associate herself with football. And it wasn't the violence or roughness of it that she didn't like. It was the fact that to her, it was boring. But she would never tell her uncle – or any of the Hazen side of her family – know that. In her family, football was king. So she unfortunately knew the game, but did not care for it. She pushed her hair out of her face and crossed her legs at the ankle. \"What have you got, uncle?\" she asked, hoping to start a conversation. She was never a fan of quiet rides and now that the radio was forced down, she figured she should try to converse with her grump-faced uncle or the guard – who she was sure wouldn't talk back because of her uncle – so she was desperate. Hazen looked up and over his glasses at her, before mumbling and looking back at the folder. \"The favor poles for the elections of the last five years. Got to start getting in early with the peoples favor if I want to run this fine state,\" he explained as Emma just smiled. She truthfully didn't think her uncle would be the best choice for governor, but she was also knew that he had a high status – negative or positive he still had one – and he would be the one that people would be watching for. \"I hear Houston and San Antonio are the main place to gain your high favor if you want to be governor,\" she said, looking out the front window as she spotted the prison in the distance closing in. Her uncle gave a grunt of agreement before putting the file away in his briefcase as they neared the gate, O'Connor flashed his badge to the guard at the gate before the Warden rolled down his window, letting in some of the heat. \"Sir,\" the gate guard greeted, faltering his salute slightly as her long legs and black heels reflected off his sleek black wire framed shades. Her uncle nodded before rolling up the window as the gate started to open. She could feel the guard trying to pear through the tinted window to see who was in the vehicle with the Warden. Emma inwardly rolled her eyes and tapped her chin. Perhaps she should have worn something else. Her hair was up in a messy but stylish bun and wore a simple black skirt that went mid thigh and white camisole under a black unbuttoned blouse and black heels. Normally she wasn't for the glossy business look, but she had wanted to look presentable for at least her first day. The car finally came to a stop near an employee parking area blocked off by a wire fence. Once parked O'Connor stepped out the front and quickly opened the door for them on her side as another guard opened the door for her uncle. She slid out smoothly legs first. Sliding her diamond covered shades over her eyes to block the sun from blinding her. She smoothed out her skirt as she felt eyes on her ass, which she ignored. Men were men, and she was, in her opinion, a decent looking female. They were going to look. In the distance where the inmates were, Emma could hear a few cat calls and whistles. She looked over her shoulder to take in a handful of inmates ogling her. She rolled her eyes before looking at her uncle. \"Should I get my suitcases?\" she asked, looking at the trunk. Her uncle waved the question off. \"My boys got it. Johnston!\" he called, the officer that let him out instantly coming to attention before him, \"take my nieces stuff to the living section then make sure Knauer knows I'm here,\" he ordered. The office nodded and opened the trunk as Emma followed her uncle into the building. -0- Brian – or Captain Knauer as he was respectfully called and known – rubbed a towel through his hair as he poked through his locker and grabbed his deodorant before applying it evenly. Around him his men jeered and shot insults and vulgarity. Def Leppards Photograph blared from the positioned speakers. The boys screamed and sang along, laughing and pushing each other around. He was just pulling on his regulation jeans when he felt a tap on his bare shoulder. He turned around to find Johnston. \"Wardens here. Wants to see ya!\" he yelled over the music, a grin splitting across his face, \"he's got some fine looking piece of ass with him too!\" This caught some of the nearby men's attention. They all called Johnston over for more details as Knauer finished getting dressed before shutting and locking his locker and heading for the Warden's office. He passed a few inmates along the way – who straightened or sneered at him – and gave them even looks, memorizing their faces for later. He walked swiftly but evenly until he finally made it to the door to the wardens office. He was greeted with Lynette reading some NFL modeling magazine and chatting on the phone. She looked up at Knauer and quickly put her hand over the mouth piece of the office phone. \"You can go in,\" she said sweetly, before returning to listen to whoever was on the phone with her. Knauer walked over to the door and tapped it with his right knuckles. Inside he could hear more than the usual two voices of Dandridge and Warden Hazen, a soft but clear voice mingled in here and there. \"Enter, Captain!\" The Warden replied as he racked the door once more for emphases on his presence. He opened the door and stepped in. \"Warden, sir\" he greeted as he shut the door behind him, straightening himself and placing his hands behind his back. Dandridge sat in his usual seat fanning himself. Knauer gave a small nod of greeting which Dandridge returned, before his gaze fell on a simple curved figure looking through the Warden's trophy case. He did a quick lookover and found Johnston was right – they had a sweet ass – before looking at the Warden as he was shutting a manila folder and tossing it with a pile of similar ones. \"Captain Knauer this is my niece. The one I told you about,\" the Warden began as the young woman sat down one of his teams group photos and turned to meet his gaze, \"she'll be staying with us til the end of August. Emma,\" the Warden looked to his niece, \"this is my captain of the guards and my star quarterback Captain Knauer. When you are unable to get to me, Captain Knauer will be the one to go to, understand?\" The woman – Emma – gave a firm understanding nod, before stepping forward and holding her hand out. He raised a brow but took her smaller hand in his larger one and shook it. \"It's a pleasure, Captain Knauer,\" she said as their hands released. He tipped his hat and gave a smooth smile. \"Pleasure's mine, ma'am. Any family of the Wardens is family to us here at Allenville,\" he drawled out, causing her to give a twitch of an amused smile, before he turned back to the Warden who was nodding in approval. \"Now Emma I'm sure you'd like to get yourself settled in. I'll have Captain Knauer escort you to your living chambers. You can spend the rest of this day getting settled in and what not. Tomorrow I'll have Lynette show you the ropes,\" he said before waving them on. \"I'll call if I can't join you for dinner.\" With that the two were dismissed. Knauer opened the door for her before following her out. She waved to Lynette before they both excited the waiting room and fell into step with each other as he lead them to the living quarters where the Warden, himself, and a few other guards stayed to be closer to home. Not many people realized that prisons way out like Allenville had living quarters for their guards so they wouldn't have to drive so many miles a day just to get two and from work. They walked in relative silence, her shoes clicking the only noise they made, as he took the time to look her over with more detail. Hard to believe she was related to the Warden, really. He didn't spy any resemblance to the old man on her. \"So,\" he drawled, causing her to glance at him, tilting her head just slightly to look at him and not seem rude, while still being able to watch where they were going, \"I take it your the niece the Warden tells us went to Harvard, right?\" She gave a small smile. \"I am. I hadn't realized my uncle talked about me. I always felt he was trying to avoid the family,\" she mused aloud, to which Knauer cracked a small smirk. \"Well we all know the Warden's a busy man so we treat him like our own family and him us so he don't have to think to poorly of not getting time with his kin.\" She pushed a loose strand of hair behind her ears and raised a brow. \"I suppose that makes you the golden son of his boys, eh Captain?\" she teased, causing him to laugh. \"I reckon it does,\" he grinned as the two fell into a comfortable silence as they stepped outside and crossed to another building near the football field. He lead her inside the apartment like set-up and led her to the elevator that would take her downstairs where the Warden's and his own room was situated near the guest bedrooms. Along the way they passed a few open doors where many of his off duty men were drinking beer, playing poker, watching TV, or playing Halo. Knauer tipped his head in greeting to them as he stood infront of the elevator, waiting for it to open. A few of his men gave him lecherous grins as they looked Emma over just as he'd done. She didn't seem to notice – or she did and didn't seem to care – and stared at the elevator until it opened. Once inside, he hit the B button before the doors closed. -0- The guards weren't the only ones doing the checking out. Emma had taken in everything around her. She made sure she could recall how to get from here to the office and had checked out every man that looked at her, being sure to remember their faces for in case she needed to know later. The elevator came to a stop and dinged open before the two stepped out. Emma let Knauer ahead of her so he could lead her to the right room. She found herself sweeping her eyes over his form. He wasn't bad on the eyes. A little older for her usual taste, but not bad... He had a nice ass on him at least. Emma may be a graduated and licened lawyer, but she was still a woman and still human. She would look like anyone else would. And how could she not? Men with uniforms were a weakness for her. Around her uncle and the men she'd be professional. But on her own she'd be her normal playful and fun self. \"Here ya are,\" Knauer said, motioning to a decent sized door near the end of the hallway. At the very end was a larger door labeled ' Warden A. Hazen '. Across from hers was another door labeled ' Cpt. B. Knauer '. \"Well,\" Emma sighed in mock disappointment, \"looks like I wont be having any nightly visitors while sharing a living quarter near my uncle, hmm?\" she asked playfully. Knauer chuckled as she opened the door, smiling as she found all her stuff on her new bed. The room was a good size – about like living in a hallowed out door room – with a queen size bed and flat screen TV. She looked around and checked the size of the bathroom – finding it decent – and then the closet size – which was probanly big enough for half her shoe collection – before going to a window and opening the blinds. Her room, while downstairs, still had a great view... Even if it was of the football field. \"Thanks, Captain. I think I can handle everything else from here,\" she chirped, turning to smile at him. He reached in his back pocket and handed her a card with a number on it. \"Call me if you need any help or get lost, alright?\" he said before tipping his hate and stepping out the room. Emma shut the door behind him before locking it and turning around to look at all her stuff. She slid off her blouse and placed her hands on her hips. \"Better get started,\" she sighed before kicking off her heels and going at her bags and totes of stuff.

The songs I listened to while writing this were Boom by Nelly, Take Me Home Tonight by Eddie Money, Somebody that I Use To Know by Gotye, Colors On The Wall (Don't Stop) by Foster The People, Take On Me by Aha, and Photograph by Def Leppard Four Hours Later She was bored. Bored out of her blooming mind. And it was only two in the afternoon. Fabulous. Emma groaned as she rolled off her bed and shut off the TV. She'd unpacked herself pretty quickly – being a former college student, she'd picked up a few things during her moving days – and had stripped out of her glossy skirt and blouse for jean shorts, a white tank-top with a red sleeveless daisy-duke plaid top tied in the front, and her favorite pair of blue and brown cowgirl boots. Her hair was let down and she propped on her white Stetson roper hat. There was nothing to watch on TV, she was unpacked and stored away, she didn't have to work til tomorrow, and she had nothing to do. \"Well,\" she mused, pulling herself up and grabbing the room key Knauer had left in the door for her, \"I'm not sitting in here all day.\" Grabbing her phone and slipping it into her pocket, Emma slipped out her room and locked it before heading to the stairs she had seen on her way out the elevator, not wanting to draw to much attention from the guards she knew would be upstairs. -0- \"BLUE EIGHTY-SEVEN! BLUE EIGHTY SEVEN! HIKE!\" Knauer barked out before the ball was snapped back to him. He quickly scanned for an opening, spotting Dunham in the distance before chucking the ball his way before he was tackled by Johnston. He slammed into the ground and grunted loudly before pushing Johnston off him in time to see Dunham make a touchdown. Good! Play went just like he'd set it up. Johnston reached down and helped him up before smacking him on the back and grinning. \"Good play, Captain,\" he praised as Knauer wiped his hands on his towel and pulled off his helmet. Like any other day, it was hotter than seven kinds of hell and brighter than bright. Some of the men had opted to break in the lounge instead of practice for their off time – which he permitted from time to time – and the few that were out with him were sweating from head to toe and covered in dirt. It was a good feeling. \"Ooh sweet apple pie! Lookit here boys! Look what I spy!\" Johnston suddenly crowed from the Gatorade table, his glass lowering from his mouth – turned up in a shit-eaters grin – as the men suddenly whistled and laughed. Knauer followed their line of vision and his eyes narrowed as he scowled. \"The hell is she doin' out of her room without an escort?\" he grumbled to himself. Walking out of the living quarters and wearing an eye catching cowgirl get-up was the Warden's niece – Emma – making her way to the main building where the library was. She walked evenly and with a sway to her hips as she jogged up the stairs. Knauer growled. He didn't tolerate any kind of disobedience. The Warden had informed him that he had told Emma that she wasn't allowed to travel the grounds without one of his men with her. Walking over to the side, Knauer grabbed one of the K9 Unit's two-ways and flipped to Lambert's channel, knowing very well he'd be in the building. \"Sargent Lambert. Keep an eye out for the special guest of ours. She's decided to go for a little sight seeing,\" he growled, before Lambert replied with a \"Got it, sir,\" as he smacked the two-way against the dog walkers hands and stormed for the locker room, letting Malloy take over. -0- \"Ah-ha,\" Emma softly exclaimed as she found what she was looking for; the library. She knew she'd seen a sign for one when Knauer was walking her to her room. Instead of rotting her brain with reruns of Weeds , she'd opted for finding the library for something to read. She had a few books in her room she could have poked through, but she was tired of reading the same thing. Sliding into the library, Emma placed her hands on her hips and glanced around while making her way to the middle section where \"Law\" was written crudely on a name-tag sticker slapped to the shelves. She stopped in front of the shelves and frowned at how unorganized and dismantled the shelves looked. Books were stacked hazardously on their side and out of order. The were all law books, though, and that was about the only organization she could find. 'Maybe uncle Reginald will let me try to fix this place up ,' she absently thought as she walked over to the next row. She glanced over each title carefully before spotting a book she had read before. \"Dammit... Why are they always on the top shelf?\" she huffed. She was at an average height of 5'6\" and the shelf about 5'7 1/2\". Great. Biting her tongue, Emma pushed herself up on her tiptoes and reached up for the book, her fingers grazing it. She glared in concentration as she tried to pull it down with what little grip on it she could get. She made sure to not try and lean on the shelf – she really didn't want to knock every shelf over like some klutz – as she grunted softly and grit her teeth. She was so focused on trying to reach the book that she almost screamed, her hand jerking back and body twisting as a hand reached past hers and grasped the book and lowered it. Emma stared wide eyed as a black inmate with dark, Hershey like, skin and darker brow eyes, a wrap and a backwards baseball cap on his head, a wife-beater and the typical blue jumpsuit pants, held the book she'd been reaching for out to her. \"Ya wanted it, right?\" he asked as she realized she was staring. Nodding, she pushed her hat up and smiled, taking the book with a soft chuckle. \"Thank-ya. I hate being short,\" she joked lightly, flipping the book over and smiling at the cover; Malcom X written in big red letters with the picture of the man himself on the cover. \"T'sa good book,\" he said with a grin, the toothpick in his mouth shifting to the side as he did. \"Ya ever read it?\" Emma looked at the book and smiled. \"Of course. Back in High School my senior year, though. I wrote a paper on him,\" she mused, recalling her Human Rights class. \"I can still remember this one quote. 'If you're not ready to die for it, put the word 'freedom' out of your vocabulary.' ... Or something like that,\" she chuckled as she tucked the book under her arm as the man gave her a small smile. \"Do you work here?\" she asked, breaking the slow silence falling between them. The man nodded and stepped around the cart he'd been pushing. \"Chu need help lookin fer somethin?\" he asked, as she looked at the shelves. \"Actually, yes,\" she began, \"I need a book on Texas State Laws... There wouldn't happen to be one here, would there?\" The male – who she now saw had the name E. Megget on his cap – gave a thoughtful nod, before jogging over to a shelf two rows behind them and reaching out and grabbing two books and running them back to her. They were thick set books. One seemingly posted back in 1974 and the other more recent being from 2003. \"Oh these are perfect,\" she beamed, flipping through the books before tucking them also under her arm. \"Thank-ya again... Megget? Did I say that right?\" He grinned with a nod and she noticed the silver wrapped around his teeth. \"S'all good. S'mah job,\" he shrugged, before turning around and going back to pushing the cart and stacking books. Emma – finding herself more interested in talking to this man instead of reading – followed him. \"Mind if I ask what the E stands for?\" she asked, gesturing to his cap as she helped him stack books, keeping hers tucked under her left arm. \"Earl. What bout you? Got a name?\" he asked. She chuckled. \"Well yes. It's Emma,\" she answered. \"No last name miss Emma?\" he teased with a smirk, grabbing a handful of books and making to stack them. Emma opened her mouth to answer when a loud voice startled her. \"Step away from the girl, maggot!\" They both turned to find a large guard – his name-tag reading Lambert – stomping towards them, his riot-club out. Megget stepped back slowly like he was told until Lambert was standing between them. Emma huffed. \"Mr... Lambert, is it? What's going on? We were simply talking,\" she said, crossing her arms, the books held against her chest. Lambert's eyes remained on Megget as two more figures made their way over to them. \"You two stay down!\" the first newcomer – a man labeled Dukes – barked at two black inmates who had stood up when Megget was pushed back by Dukes. \"Now stop that!\" Emma exclaimed in irritation. She understood Megget was a con, but he had been very civil and had respected her space – unlike Dukes and Lambert who were practically pushing her against them – and hadn't done a thing to her! \"Now gentleman no need to startle miss Hazen,\" a voice drawled to her left. Emma turned to find Captain Knauer swaggering towards them. His sharp blue eyes flicked from her to Megget. \"Inmate Megget you just go on back to work now, ya hear?\" he ordered. Megget gave a small glare but nodded and ducked off, catching Emma's eye just before he disappeared as Dukes grabbed him by the scruff of his tank-top and pushed him away. Emma scowled and opened her mouth for Dukes to stop, when a hand grabbed her wrist. Knauer yanked her softly – but firmly – to the exit. \"Wait! I have books I need to check out,\" she snapped, prying his grip from her wrist and stomping over to he checkout desk and writing down the books she had before stomping past Knauer and Lambert as they stood at the door, her boots clicking loudly off the polished floor. What was wrong with these men? She could understand needed to show power, but intimidating and throwing an inmate around for just talking? That was barbaric! While the incarcerate may be so, they were still human! This was against everything she'd been taught was right. She clinched the books against her chest and scowled, ignoring the person – Knauer – stomping behind and after her as she made her way out of the building, ignoring the stares a few inmates threw her way. Outside the building, Knauer finally caught up as she made down the stairs, grasping her elbow firmly but not enough to bruise and bring her to a halt. \"Now slow your horses, darlin,\" Knauer said as he stepped around to stand in-front of her at the bottom of the stairs. Emma yanked her arm free once again. These men needed to learn personal space and no touching. \"Was that called for?\" she exploded finally, hands on her hips. \"That inmate and I were having a respectful conversation until your men came in and threw him around like that lousy pigskin you boys seem so charmed over!\" Knauer raised a brow at her explosion, but his expression was that of amusement and slight annoyance. \"Well now miss Emma I'm sorry we interrupted your little time with inmate Megget, but,\" he drawled gratingly at her nerves, \"that little moment shouldn't have happened in the first place. Last I recall your uncle gave specific orders that you weren't to move around without an escort. Orders he passed on to me and that I plan on following. And you will to, ya hear me?\" Emma scowled. \"I was simply going to the library, Captain. I didn't realize I would need one to go check out a few books,\" she huffed, crossing her arms tighter. She hated that she was being scolded like some child. Granted, yes, her uncle had set up some rules during the car ride but really she had just walked to the library – which was only a few yards from the living quarters – and possibly crawling with enough guards for her to run to if something happened. Knauer, hands on his hip, shook his head and chuckled. Emma's frown deepened as he gave her a look before gently going for her arm again. Emma pulled it free and growled. \"Cut that out. I don't need to be manhandled everywhere I go, Captain, so refrain from the constant friendly grabbing, sir!\" She glared at him as he let his hands at his side, palms going up and giving her some space. Good. Huffing Emma stepped fully down the stairs, now having to look up at him – which she hated – as she gestured for him to lead them away. He turned and headed on, Emma keeping close, but behind him. She stared at the living quarters expecting to be forced back into her room. She was startled when instead he lead them to the training field. She could hear grunts and calls for plays being made. Catching up to his longer legged stride, Emma almost pumped into him as they came to a halt at the twenty-yard line of the left end of the field. \"Now since, miss Hazen, you feel like being out, I reckon you can spend outside with me and the boys. I had to draw a quick shower to come and escort you back,\" Knauer said as they walked to where a white tent was set up with seats and a small desk. Emma guessed that this was where her uncle would sit when he would watch his boys practice. Knauer led her under the ten and motioned for her to have a seat at the table as a guard – his tag reading Webster – came to stand nearby, a grin on his face. \"Sargent Webster will keep you company while I go and get myself ready to finish my time with my team. He'll be sure to call me if there are any issues you or him may have,\" Knauer beamed as Emma scowled and grabbed one of her books. Fine. She'd play along for now. Flipping the book open, Emma began to ignore the Captain and Webster's presence for her book. Her eyes flicked up to watch the Captain and Webster exchange looks as he walked off, leaving her with the unknown and decent sized officer who she knew was trying to get a view of her ass. Ugh. Gross. \"This is going to be a fun summer,\" Emma huffed with a shake of her head before truly burying herself in her law book with the sound of men grunting and roaring like neanderthals in the background. -0- \"Megget, man, that's bull,\" Cheeseburger Eddy scoffed as the two made their way over to the basketball court. The heat was vaporous off the black-top as giant men to small men were thrown to the ground as a ball was passed around and bounced by large hands. Megget and Cheeseburger walked over to where Deacon – the unofficial head of the group – stood with his arms crossed silently, watching the current game go on. Must be a disbute. Deacon was real good about keeping his boys from pounding each others heads in. He'd instead have them duke it out in the court playing ball so the heat would wear him out. If he hadn't ended up in the joint, Megget wouldn't be surprised if Deac could have gone on to become some kind of counsler. Big guy he may be, yeah. But he had heart. \"Ooooh! Damn, ha! Hey Xavier! You getting yer ass handed to ya, dawg!\" Cheeseburger laughed as he took to standing at Deacon's right. Megget took to standing beside Cheeseburger and watching the game. He tapped Cheeseburger's arm. \"An nah, man. It aint bull. I swear,\" he tried again. Cheeseburger scoffed and Deacon looked away from the game. \"What's goin on?\" he asked. Cheeseburger burst in before Megget could reply. \"Hey yo, Deac, Megget be out in this heat to much! He swear up and down he saw a white chick up in the library!\" he laughed, causing a few heads to turn and the game to stop. Deacon silenced Eddy, fixing his eyes on Megget, who was waving off Cheeseburger. \"He's tellin the truth. Saw it for myself,\" Deacon said, causing everyone to go a little quiet. Which for the courts was odd. A few guards even stopped and watched them now. Megget smirked at the look on Cheeseburgers face. \"Told ya, man,\" he chuckled, smacking his friend on the arm before walking off to grab the ball as it bounced his way. He dribbled it a few times before shooting it. Cheeseburger grabbed the ball as soon as it went through the hoop. \"The hell was a white bitch doin in the library?\" he asked. Everyone was now surrounding Megget, who rolled his eyes. Man leave it to Cheeseburger to make things crazier than they needed to be. Deacon nodded for him to tell and Megget shrugged. \"Checkin out Malcolm X and some old law books is all. Names Emma. Didn' catch no last name. Knauer and the heat showed up and dragged her off,\" he shrugged again. Wasn't much to tell, really. A few raunchy calls and laughs broke out amongst the crowd \"Saw her in the Warden's car. Possibly just a piece of ass for him,\" someone yelled out, causing laughter and looks and grunts of disgust to break out. \"I'unno, man, but she wasn't to bad on the eyes,\" Megget grinned, causing them all to break out and laugh, whistling and shoving him around. \"A'right. If y'all see her, steer clear though,\" Deacon ordered, causing everyone to quiet. \"Prolly just some bitch workin for the warden. Aint no need to be messin with that. Understood?\" he ordered, causing them all to tsk and throw up there hands, but never the less agreeing. Deacon nodded before taking the ball from Megget. \"Alright. Who's next?\" he asked, as a few hands reached for the ball and ran for the court. Megget sat down on the bench and lounged, his mind on the library events and many other things. To many things for a locked up man to be thinking off. He shook his head clear and focused on the game. R & R And thank-you, Black Blood Exorcist, for being the first to comment. And ashley0921 for being the FIRST to fav (BBE the next ;) ). You've both made my heart burst with happy butterflies, you did -Huggles and snuggles you both- Also I received another note asking if this was going to be a Megget/OC fic. Nope. Friendship possibly. But nope. I like Megget but he aint the star... This time lol.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I do not own The Longest Yard . At All. I do not own any music or device mentioned. None of it. I do, however, own any new characters that pop up in this story. They are mine. Therefore, please ASK ME before trying to use. Thanks ^^ Authoress Note: This piece takes place just about a few weeks before Paul arrives to Allenville. I am going to do my best to make this enjoyable and readable. I did not do so hot on my first fic for this awesome remake of a classic (total Mary-Sue BS man.. Ugh. It hurts to try and reread it lol). So I will be pushing to make sure this comes out better and less painful for me to reread lol. Extra Note: I received a note saying that people felt my Knauer was out of character. Was he? I'm sorry! I'm trying, I swear lol. Everyone interprets a character differently, ya know? Apparently I didn't interpret Knauer right... Oopsie doodle! Well I will keep trying to make this what you all want to see! The songs I listened to while writing this were 369 by Cupid ft. B.O.B., Kill Your Heroes by Awolnation, Inside Out by Eve 6, Lullabye by Nickleback, I Just Died (In Your Arms Tonight) by Cutting Crew, and Every Breath You Take by The Police. (And the reason I do this is to give you all a feel for what I listen to while writing these pieces for y'all and maybe seeing if ya'll have some music you think I should hear). April 23rd, 2005 \"Lynette? Where should I file these? They fall under column A and B...\" Emma asked, turning to hand a manila folder with an inmates name – Javier Pazero – to the elderly woman as she looked up from her typewrite (which amused Emma to know end.. .Who still used typewriters?) and pushed her glasses up to look over the file. \"Oh! Well now why dont we make a column C for others? That would work,\" she chirped as Emma smiled and grabbed a black marker and labeled a new folder \"Column C – Others\", before sticking Pazero's folder away and shutting the cabinet. Straightening her top – a short sleeved baby blue shirt – Emma made a face at the dust on her fingers. Had nobody thought to dust this place? \"Lynette do we have someone who I can get a duster from? This place could use a little sprucing,\" she asked, wiping the dust on her blue capri's as the older woman gave a thoughtful look. \"Well as a matter of fact there is. A nice young man who comes by and wipes the floor has a duster I bet... Oh now what was his name...,\" Lynette mumbled to herself in thought as Emma heard something outside. \"Inmate Farrel! Get back to work!\" Emma made a face and walked to the door. What was all that screaming about? Looking back at Lynette – who was now looking through the old PC for name – Emma shook her head and pried the door open a bit, peeking out into the hallway. She squinted and narrowed in on a scrawny – and somewhat short – black male with a pencil stuck behind his ear and a baseball inmate cap slightly askew on his head. Standing nearby with his riot stick ready was Sargent Dunham. \"Nigger, I told you to keep moving!\" he barked, smirking at the slight stiff shake of the head the inmate – Farrel? - gave as he dropped his mop into a bucket and went back to scrubbing the floors. Scowling, Emma made to go out and yell at the big asshole for using such a disgraceful word. She may be from the deep south but that was not a word she liked to hear. From anyone. She stopped, however, as an idea came to mind. Flipping her hair back and tussiling it abit, Emma reached out and grabbed a form – one that she would have to get to Knauer later – and held it against herself. Perking herself up, Emma strolled out of the office. \"Sargent Dunham,\" she called with the best sultry and sweet-pie voice she could pull off. She strolled up to him with a sway to her step, smiling and flipping her hair out of her face. Farrel glanced up – doing a double take – as he continued to mop while Dunham looked up with the biggest shit-eating smile she'd ever seen. \"Well well well! Howdy, darlin,\" he drawled out, using his riot-club to push up his baseball cap, his eyes sliding over her form with appreciation. Snuffing the urge to roll her eyes or step back in disgust, Emma gave her best sultry smile and giggle. \"Howdy... Dunham I have a major favor... Can you help lil ol' me?\" she asked with a pout and batting of her eyes, walking over to let him invade her bubble more. \"I need to get these to Captain Knauer... But I'm just so busy... You wouldn't mind taking them for me would ya?\" she asked, handing him the papers, her hand purposefully brushing his. Dunham gave her a fersome and almost animal like grin as he looked down at her. She really hated how many of these guards reminded her of wrestlers you'd see on TV – big and beefy like. \"Well course,\" he grinned, \"anything fer you sweet-cheeks.\" He pulled his cap down as she giggled as he tapped her under the chin and puffed himself up before heading off with the papers. Once out of earshot, Emma made a gagging sound. \"Oh... Gag...,\" she turned and looked at Farrel and gave a dramatic \"about-to-barf\" sound. \"You wouldn't happen to have mouthwash for the taste in my mouth and bleach to scrub myself with would ya?\" Farrel cracked a very pearly white grin as he stopped mopping. \"Nah, but you can stick your head in the bucket if that'll help.\" Emma looked down at the soapy water and stuck out her tongue. \"I don't know... I'm tempted but I hate getting my hair wet, you know?\" she chuckled as Farrel leaned against the mop and grinned. \"Does he always use such a racial word? I mean is that really called for?\" she asked with a huff, pushing her hair out of her face and smoothing it down. He shrugged. \"Nah. Sometimes he likes to throw in some other colorful ones. But it's cool. He don't know I got a guy to take a piss in his Gaterade every week,\" he grinned, causing Emma to gasp in disgust. \"Ooh! Oh that's... That's disgusting! Eww!\" she laughed full heartedly, almost hunching over. She calmed herself and evened her breathing and shook her head. \"Oh, wow.\" The inmate chuckled before holding out his hand. \"Caretaker,\" he introduced himself as. Emma raised a brow, but shrugged in acceptance and held out her hand. \"Emma Hazen. Pleasure,\" she replied, causing a surprised look to appear on his face as their hands released. \"Oh shit! You related to the warden?\" he asked, tilting his head and glancing at where her uncle's office was then back to her. Emma frowned. \"Yeah. He's my uncle,\" she clarified, not seeing the big deal really. So what if her uncle was the warden. Caretaker shook his head. \"Boy... You must have fallen on the otherside of the tree!\" he laughed softly, going back to mopping. \"Oh? What side would that be?\" Emma asked in earnest, amused by what he possibly had to say. \"You fell on the side with the looks and good attitude,\" he clarified, earning a small giggle. Nice. \"I suppose to you all he seems pretty... Harsh. But he is my uncle. He's family... Not very close, mind you, but family none the less.\" Caretaker gave a small nod of agreement as he stuffed the mop back into the bucket. Emma snapped her fingers. \"Oh! Hey? You wouldn't happen to know where to find something to help with dusting would ya? I need to clean down the office,\" she explained, looking back at the office door. Caretaker nodded before sitting the mop against the wall and walking off around the corner. Emma waited patiently for his return before he came around the corner with a duster and a can of dusting spray. Emma beamed as she took them from him. \"Oh, thank-you! I was afraid I'd have to ask another guard for help. I mean I don't mind the guards... They're just not very fun to deal with, ya know?\" she sighed. \"Tell me about it,\" Caretaker scoffed, grabbing his mop and going back to work. Emma smiled and gave a wave. \"Well it was nice meeting you, Caretaker... Why are you called that?\" she asked, curious. His name-tag – upon closer inspection – did say Farrel. Caretaker looked up from moping. \"Well they call me that cause whatever your pleasures, I can facilitate. You need weed, meth, prozac, whatever, I'm your man,\" he answered smoothly and with a grin. \"Heck for a small fee I can even get McDonalds,\" he clarified, causing Emma to chuckle. \"Very nice,\" she said. \"I'm sure the guards love you, huh,\" she mused. Caretaker shrugged. \"I have occasionally been told I'm a sneeky rat. But hey aint my fault I'm smarter,\" he puffed up slightly, causing Emma to smile. \"True... Well Caretaker, thanks. Maybe I'll see you around again?\" she asked, as he shrugged. \"Possibly. I'm here two times a week.\" Emma made sure to memorize that, before nodding and waving. She turned around and slipped back into the office, finding Lynette looking at pictures of underwear models on the old computer, seeming to have forgotten about her question from earlier. Chuckling to herself, Emma sprayed down the dusty areas and went to work, not realizing that her little exchange – though not heard – had been seen. -0- \"You're telling me she let herself alone with an inmate again?\" Knauer sighed in aggravation, slamming her sweatbands into his locker and running his fingers through his stark-red hair angrly as Dunham – who had walked back in time to witness part of the exchange - nodded. Emma was really starting to get at him. He had hoped that yesterday would have made her realize that he wasn't Okay with her pulling that kind of shit. After practice he had walked her back to her room, making sure to remind her that she was not to be alone with any of the inmates and to always have a guard with her when she wa ready to leave. Lynette was the only female he'd ever left alone with an inmate and that's only cause the warden was right in his office and a guard was always posted outside at the ready. He glared at Dunham. \"And you just left her there?\" Dunham looked agitated as he growled something about \"sneaky bitch\" and Knauer shook his head. Something had to be done about this. Knauer rubbed his hin in thought. \"I want you to stay posted by the door. Don't do anything until lunch. I want you to inform me right away when she's done. It's time she sees just how dangerous these inmates are,\" he grabbed his towel and slammed his locker shut. Dunham nodded with a grin. \"Got it, sir,\" he replied before storming off back to his post. Knauer shook his head and walked off to the showers/ -0- Three hours later Emma stretched out on one of the seats in the office and yawned. \"Ugh.. Gosh darnit, Lynette, how do you do this everyday? I'm bored out of my mind,\" she laughed. It wasn't that Emma hated working in the office – it was only the first day so no judging – but she wondered if anything interesting ever happened. Lynette gave a small humming laugh. \"Oh well I've been here for years, sweetie. I find my own entertainment. Keeps me sane and going, you know?\" she winked and Emma smiled. Lynette may be a weird – and perverted – old thing, but she was fun and sweet. Shaking her head she looked at the clock and felt her stomach grumble a little. Food time. Standing up, Emma walked to the door. She knew there was a wreckroom for the guards two halls down and guessed that there'd be vending machines. Maybe she could grab a Snickers bar or something. \"Lynette? I'm gonna take my break. Be back in twenty!\" she said, making her way out the door and down the hallway. Turning the corner, Emma jumped and almost screamed as she about ran into two large figures – Dunham and Malloy – waiting for her. \"Oh sweet Jesus!\" Emma panted, rubbing at her heart. Dunham and Malloy grinned. \"Boy howdy she is a purty thang aint she?\" Malloy laughed, looking her over. That was really getting old from these men. From the inmates she'd expect that. They'd been locked up for years without a female. But the guards could at least leave! It wasn't like they hadn't seen legs and breast in awhile. \"Oh she's a regular princess, aint cha sweet-heart?\" Dunham asked as they began to heard her down another hallway from the one she'd been about to go down. Emma blinked, startled, as she tried to move from them to go back where she'd been. \"Nuh-uh, sweet-cheeks!\" Dunham laughed as him and Malloy blocked off her escape. \"Captain Knauer wants a word with ya,\" Malloy grinned, ushering her once again down the halls. Emma frowned, but relented, allowing them to lead her on. As they neared a small stairway to a door, Emma could hear a gymnasium of voice, which she was hit with as soon as she stepped through the door she was lead to – more like was pushed through – by the guards. She blinked and was startled to find she was on a catwalk overlooking what appeared to be the inmate cafeteria. She looked down below and shuddered. She was not a fan of heights. Gripping the railing, she felt many eyes below shift her way. Whistles and murmers started up as it seemed every inmate in the cafeteria was now looking up at her. Dunham and Malloy stood on either side of her, grinning. Was there a purpose for her to be here? \"Miss Hazen! So glad of you to join us!\" A voice below called. Emma – reluctantly – looked straight down until she found the Captain looking up at her, hands on his hips, cowboy hat in place. Emma frowned as she followed the Captain as he made his way up to her using a very slanted stairway. Once on the catwalk, he strolled over to her, walking past Dunham. \"Thank-you boys. I got it from here,\" he said, dismissing them until it was him, Emma, and two guards standing near the two doorways with their guns ready. Emma crossed her arms and raised a brow at him. \"Can I help you, sir?\" she asked in slight frustration. All she wanted was to get a Snickers candy bar and here she was getting dragged on to an overviewing catwalk – which was freaking her out from the height – to talk to a man who she was actually starting to not like. He gave a small, even, smile and paced slightly around her. \"Well yes you can, miss Hazen,\" he began, his voice just loud enough for the two of them to hear – which was hard with all the cat calls and whatnot being thrown up their way. \"You can help me by explaining why you feel the need to once again go against specific orders set out for your own safety?\" he asked, stopping infront of her, leaning casually against the railing. What? Emma furrowed her brow and crossed her arms. \"What are you talkin about, Knauer? I haven't done anything. I haven't strayed to the library. Granted, yes, I did leave the office to try to get a candy bar, but I don't see-\" the Captain cut her off by raising a hand like a traffic cop. Emma's mouth popped shut and she glared. She hated being interrupted. \"Now what I'm talkin about, miss Hazen, is your little time with inmate Caretaker,\" he specified, causing Emma to blink in surprise. How had he known about that-? Emma's eyes snapped to where Dunham stood near the doorwaty and inwardly cursed him. Dammit all! Sighing, Emma held her head in her left hand. \"Nothing happened,\" she mumbled in angravation. This was ridiculous! What was the big deal? She was close enough to her uncle's office and Lynette if something were to happen for Christ sakes! What was the big deal? Knauer shook his head and straightened himself up. \"Something may not have happened this time, or even the last time, yes,\" he began, hands on his hips, \"but what about the next time? Or the time after that? See you gotta learn that these... men ,\" he sneered, gesturing out to the inmates, \"are all a bunch of murdering, thieving, horny bastards who would just love to get a chance at a slip of a thing like yourself, miss Hazen.\" A few of the inmates closer to the walkway were straining to listen up at them, she noticed, as she clamped her mouth shut. She could tell him that while these men may be in for horrible, dangerous, and foul deeds they were not the ones she was feeling uncomfortable with. Since her arrival the guards at not respected her space, had eyed her more than the men below her, and loved to come off as intimidating to her. But she snuffed her urge to retort in annoyance and nodded. \"I understand what you're saying, Captain. I don't, however,\" she began carefully, \"see the big deal about conversing with the cons near my uncle's office or in an area where I know your men are nearby enough for me to not feel like I'm under glass.\" she pushed her hair out of her face and placed her hands on her hips. \"I did not come here for the summer to be locked up in my room or be escorted by meat-walls, sir. I came here to study and learn more about the other side of the law and to update myself with the current great state laws for my profession. I can't learn more if I'm not near some of the sources, can I?\" she asked, matching the condescending tone he'd been using with her. Knauer glared, not seeming to like her trying to throw her own logic back at him. His brilliant blue eyes flashed as a thought seemed to catch him and he smiled. \"Well I wasn't aware of your specific reasons for joining us here at Allenville. Perhaps we should go discuss this with the warden, huh? I would love to hear his opinion on your adventures.\" Emma narrowed her eyes and gave him her best pissed off glare before almost growling. \"Fine... Lead the way, Captain,\" she finished with sour coated sweetness, gesturing him towards the exit closer to her uncle's office. Knauer lowered his hat and grabbed her shoulder carefully and lead her out the door and – thankfully – off the walkway, the both of them in calm, even, steps with each other as they made for the office. -0- Reginald shook his head in disbelief and disappointment as Knauer finished recapping today's and yesterdays events. He was very angry. Angry at Knauer for not having informed him of this soon, at Emma for disobeying him when he'd made her swear to do as he said, and mad at himself for agreeing to let his headstrong niece stay. She got the headstrong trait honest – mother and father and all the Hazen's had it bad – and that really irked him to no end. \"Emma this is very serious,\" he began, leaning forward, his palms firmly plced on the oak-wood of his desk, \"I set guidelines – certain rules – for a purpose. I can't have you wandering around and conversing with the inmates! These men are here to be rehabilitated for society. A woman's presence is the last temptation they need to go and do something stupid!\" his voice had risen and he stared in his niece's eyes for confirmation that she understood what he was saying. She gave a soft sigh, closing her eyes and nodding, before fixing him with a look. \"I apologize, uncle Reginald. I understand the consequences my actions could ensure and I accept your concern... However,\" she began, causing him to inwardly groan, \"I came here to study the other side of the law. In order to understand what is happening in today's judicial system and to become the great Texas lawyer that I plan on, I need to know the con's side. Need to get my hands a little dirty. I can't get this information – this understanding – if I'm forcefully kept in the office and my room!\" she snapped, smacking his desk in irritation, matching his stern \"no-nonsense\" gaze. Law school was the perfect choice for her, alright. Reginald sat back in his chair and rubbed at his temple. This was why he never had kids and why he and his former wife – Diane – were divorced. Women were nothing but headaches created by God himself. His eyes flickered to Captain Knauer as he stood near the door, arms behind his back. He took in how his Captain's eyes would trail to his niece as she gave her rant, an amused smirk twitching across his face, before he would look forward. Hmm. He pushed himself from his chair and turned to look out the window at the football field. \"Emma you are absolutely right,\" he began, an idea forming. He couldn't see, but he was sure his niece had a surprised look on her face. He heard her shift in her seat. \"I did allow you to come up here for the purpose of your studies and I intend to let you go about them. However,\" he firmly cut in as he turned and watched her open her mouth to reply, cutting her off, \"you will do them under my terms.\" Emma raised a brow and placed her hands on her lap. \"And those are?\" she asked warily. Reginald smiled and looked to his captain. \"Captain Knauer, what would you say about having you or one of your men watching Emma while she travels around? Not escorting her, no. Give her some room to stretch and interact but of course being on the ready?\" he asked, causing Emma to sit-up in surprise. Knauer and him shared a look before he nodded. \"Well I think that's a real good idea, warden,\" he said, fingers hooking into his belt loops. \"I'm sure my men will be all over it as well.\" Emma looked back at the captain and Reginald smiled, straightening up. \"What do you say, Emma?\" he asked, causing her to turn and look back at him. \"I... I can agree with this, yes,\" she faltered, seeming surprised by this outcome. Reginald felt his smile widen and he nodded. \"Good. Now, why don't you go back and finish helping Lynette. Captain Knauer,\" he began, stopping the man from leaving, \"stay. I'd like a word with you real quick.\" Knauer nodded as he opened the door for Emma, the two sharing looks – Emma's triumph, Knauers blank – before he shut the door. Knauer turned and stood before him, hands once again behind his back. \"Captain Knauer if there's one thing about my family that I loath and respect, it's that we are stubborn and clever,\" he sighed, stuffing his hands into his pockets and shaking his hands, waving for the Captain to take a seat, which he gladly did. \"Emma's a good girl. Good grades, high standing, a regular law star in the making... But she's to soft,\" he sighed in frustration. \"If there was one person – other than yourself – that I could see taking over for Allenville when I become governor, it would be her. But she needs to learn the truth about the men she is so keen on associating herself with.\" He took a seat and leaned back, meeting the other man's gaze. \"This is where you and your men come in.\" Knauer tilted his head. \"What would you like us to do, sir?\" he asked, entranced. Reginald smiled before leaning forward and stealing his gaze. \"I want you to make sure she sees the true side of the criminal mind. Want you and your men to help her understand that these... criminals are nothing but animals and not the men she thinks. I can't have her underestimating danger in my prison. Understand?\" A gleam came to the captain's eyes and Reginald knew he understood. \"Oh, yes, sir,\" he nodded, coming to a stand, \"crystal clear. I'll let my men know.\" With that, Reginald dismissed his captain and watched him leave. He looked over at Dandridge – who had been fanning himself and listening quietly – and smiled. \"Errol I think things are goin' to get mighty interesting 'round here, wouldn't you agree?\" he asked, causing Errol to nod and fan himself harder. \"Oh, yes, I agree. Mighty interesting.\" Reginald nodded before turning to look back at the window, his hands stuffed in his pocket and watching his men practice outside on the field. R & R Plz And oooh, look! Some plot is poking it's head out. Where am I going with this? Anyone know? Heehee. Bet not![Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not own The Longest Yard . At All. I do not own any music or device mentioned. None of it. I do, however, own any new characters that pop up in this story. They are mine. Therefore, please ASK ME before trying to use. Thanks ^^ Authoress Note: This piece takes place just about a few weeks before Paul arrives to Allenville. I am going to do my best to make this enjoyable and readable. I did not do so hot on my first fic for this awesome remake of a classic (total Mary-Sue BS man.. Ugh. It hurts to try and reread it lol). So I will be pushing to make sure this comes out better and less painful for me to reread lol. Extra Note: Hey! Back again lol. I'm enjoying myself, truly, with this story. It's become my third focus – first being school, second being work – so I'm happy to see people are checking this out. And I'm sorry if the pacing is weird or slow. I'm just trying to make this work out right, ya know? Want this story to go as I have it semi-planned out so y'all and myself will enjoy ourselves. The songs I listened to while writing this were Why Can't This Be Love by Van Halen, I Hold On by Slash feat. Kid Rock, What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy) by Information Society, When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going by Billy Ocean, She Wolf by Shakira, and Set Fire To The Rain by Adele. April 27th, 2005 A week had passed without much happening. Emma had kept to the rules this time and had been able to freely talk to Caretaker when he would pass by – with a guard watching nearby incase he was needed – and Emma, who should have been pleased, felt uneasy. Nobody in the Hazen family just gave up. They always had a back-up plan. At least her father always did with her and her mother if he couldn't get them to do something or a plan went wrong. Emma could be the same, but she wasn't as quick as her uncle and father – who always seemed to know what the other was up to – and thus felt herself slightly on edge. \"-so his dumbass tries to hide in his cell! Got the shit beat out of him for bein an idiot and letting Dukes hear him!\" Caretaker scoffed, drawing Emma back to reality. Caretaker was one of her perks of being here. She fully enjoyed talking to him. He was funny, a little charming, somewhat of a gentleman, and a good source of gossip on the guards. Emma had learned quit a lot about the beefy men and their habits and ways around the prison. Emma shook her head, jumping back into reality and the story. \"So what happened to him?\" she asked, crossing her arms and shifting to her other leg. \"Well,\" Caretaker drawled with a chuckle, wiping at the floor with his mop like always, \"he got his ass transferred! Told his lawyer the heat was making him delusional or some bullshit like that and was able to get a ride to some mental hospital. Lucky man. Heard they have great mattresses,\" he sighed as Emma laughed. Sometimes the small things that Caretaker talked about missing made her feel blessed. The two fell into a comfortable silence – a silence that just screamed friendship – as she glanced up at the clock and frowned. It was only eleven-thirty? Ugh. Allenville seemed to like to slow down time, it did. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm a prisoner,\" she mused, watching Caretaker wipe up a few boot-prints off the ground, \"I'm starting to understand what you all feel like. Is it always this boring? What do you all do for fun?\" she asked, leaning against the hallway wall and lazily staring out a window at the field. Caretaker dunked his mop into the dirty, sud filled, water and shrugged. \"Do whatever, ya know? Sew, learn a new language, crossword puzzles, read, masturbate, work out, basketball, whatever! You just learn to use your time.\" Emma chuckled and shook her head, looking back out the window. \"It would be a good day to tan. Decent breeze, a few clouds, nice sunshine; perfect weather... If I wasn't at a prison.\" She shrugged as Caretaker shook his head and grinned. The two smiled at each other and Emma pushed herself back from the window. \"I think I better get back in and help Lynette. Same time next week?\" she asked him as she turned for the door. \"Yeah! Catch ya later,\" he waved as they parted ways. Emma slipped back into the office and went to work at helping Lynette fill out a few papers for transfers and acceptances. -0- \"Yo Caretaker!\" James \"Caretaker\" Farrel – having finished a deal for getting fellow inmate Glory some weed and put away his mop for the day – tilted his head as he walked past the library and was ushered in by someone calling him. Stepping into the library, he glanced around until he saw Megget – who it seems was on break – and inamte Deacon Moss calling him over to their table. Only three inmates per table were allowed, so Cheeseburger Eddy and some guy named Rogers sat at another table nearby for support if needed. Pushing his pencil back behind his ear, he looked around to note where any of the guards could be, before taking a seat. \"Evening, guys,\" he greeted calmly. It wouldn't do any good to come off as wanting to stir up trouble with these brothers, \"what can I do for ya?\" Deacon tilted his head up, glaring down at Caretaker past his cap – an easy feet since Deac was already taller than Caretaker – and leaned back. \"Heard you been talkin to that white girl over at the warden's office. This true?\" he asked. Caretaker furrowed his brow, nit sure where this was going, but nodded heavily. Deacon gave a nod. \"Any reason why she's here?\" he asked, and Caretaker was again confused. Why the interest? OK granted all the guys had been trying to get a look at Emma since she'd shown up at the Cafeteria last week, but what man wouldn't? \"Yeah. She's here for some study shit. She's a Harvard gal. Graduated and certified lawyer. She's getting the scoop on the other side, from what she and Lynette have said,\" Caretaker explained. Lynette was always spreading the gossip to anyone who would listen – guard or inmate alike – and he was always keeping up with it. Probably why people came to him a lot for details. \"She gonna cause trouble? People like that always stick their nose in places they dont need to be. I don't need any of my guys getting shit,\" Deacon asked, and Caretaker got it. Deac was worried that having Emma around was just a trick from the warden to catch them all doing something that would get them all a few extra years and weeks in the hot boxes. Caretaker held up his hands. \"Now hold on. Emma's just some fresh outta college girl is all. She aint gonna cause no trouble,\" Caretaker stumbled, trying to keep Deacon calm. Cheeseburger and Deacon shared a look. \"Ya sure, man?\" Cheeseburger asked, standing up and hovering over the small male with his massive size. Caretaker nodded quickly out of enthusiasm and slight fear. \"Oh, yeah, man! She's just here to watch! She'll be gone by August!\" Deacon – as much as he could – seemed to relax slightly and nodded. \"I'm holding you to this, man,\" he drawled before standing. Cheeseburger and the others followed his lead and they all made for the exit. Caretaker let out a breath and shook his head. \"Damn!\" he muttered, taking a stand. He looked over at Megget and the two shared a look. \"Hey, man,\" Megget nodded, grabbing his cart and preparing to walk around and pick-up books from the cells and occasional guard who – shockingly – read, \"I believe ya. I'll make sure ta help out. She was alright to me.\" Caretaker nodded with a small smile before he stood and headed off with a shake of the head. The hell did he have to get sent to the one prison that has more drama than high school? -0- \" Baby grind on me/ Relax your mind take your time on me/ Let me get deeper shorty ride on me-! \" Emma sang, ear-buds in as she read through her law book. Lynette had everything handled for now, so she had opted to read and write down some important information she could. She was learning a lot about her home states laws – things she didn't know or had ever really dug into while in law school – and she was pleased. She had opted to bring her iPod with her to avoid being stuck with listening to Lynette's fingers clicking away at the keyboard. She sat at a makeshift desk that her and Lynette had Garner drag in from the nearby closet for her to use. A little rearrangement and she had her own little corner to relax and work at; old school typewriter and all. Flipping the page after writing down an important key, Emma flicked through her music as Pretty Ricky ended. \" ...How you like it daddy?)/ Would you do it from the front?/ (How you like it daddy?)/ Whould you do it from the back?/ (How you like it daddy?)/Baby bring it down like that!- \" she sang along, grinning. She loved the songs that a person could dance to and feel sexy. Singing along softly, and music blaring in her ear, Emma almost didn't hear Lynette call out to her. Popping the right bud from her ear she gave a sheepish smile. \"Sorry, Lynette. I didn't hear ya. What do ya need?\" she asked, turning her music off and sitting her book down. Lynette tutted at her. \"Darlin' you'll loose your hearing bfore your thirty if you keep that up!\" Emma gave a mock eye roll and smiled as Lynette smiled back before holding up a folder. \"Could you take this to Captain Knauer? He isn't answering his phone so he must be in the locker room. Boys have that music as loud as you down there. It's a wonder you all aint def!\" she babbled as Emma took the folder reluctantly. Since the disagreement between them, Emma had made sure to avoid Knauer – which was hard seeing as he lived across from her now – and made her mission to not talk or mess with him. He was one of those men that, while having a nice ass and was easy on the eyes, she easily called an asshole. But she knew the warden would get onto Lynette is she didn't get the folder to him, so she agreed. \"Oh dammit... I'll need to find an escort though,\" she huffed. Lynette waved her on. \"Oh all you gotta do is go down this hallway to the elevator and take it down. I think you can handle that on your own,\" she scoffed. Lynette was on her side. While she agreed that Emma should steer clear of the more populated con areas, she seemed to feel that as long as she was nearby she'd be OK. Emma knew she liked the crazy, underwear model obsessed, old woman for a reason. Emma smiled and headed for the door. \"I'll be back,\" she said before exiting the room and heading down the hallway. She looked around for a guard. She could at least try to act like she was trying to follow her uncle's orders. But she ran into no one – guard or inmate – so she carried on. At the elevator she hit the down button and waited. She glanced up and down the two way hallway but again saw no one. The inmates must all be outside since it was actually nice for once. It was nice enough that Emma had opted for a simple and comfortable light red dress and silver heels. Her hair was up in a stylish, though messy, bun and she'd applied just a smudge of make-up. Tapping her foot, Emma sighed as the elevator opened. Stepping inside she hit the large B button and closed the door, heading down. She leaned back and stared at the door. Out of the corner of her right eye she could see the camera turn and look at her. She ignored it and waited until the elevator finally opened up into a rather ugly colored corridor. Wrinkling her nose, Emma realized she wasn't really sure where the locker rooms were from here. Stepping out of the elevator, Emma's heels clicked loudly as she made her way down the hallway. She could hear loud late 90's music – was that Kid Rock? - coming from behind two large blue doors with the Guardsmen symbol plastered in the center, covering both doors. Emma steeled herself, realizing that she'd be entering a place where half or fully naked men that looked like brick walls were, she took a breath and opened the door... And was instantly assualted with the song \" Bawitdaba \" blaring loudly around the room. Heads turned and looked her way as she stepped in – putting on her best neutral expression, and looked around for the Captain. The cat-calls and whistling started up. The men straightened up and leered lecherously at her as she made her way through the locker room, making sure to not let any of them run into her or her into them, ducking and sliding by until she spotted a head of stark red – wet – hair. Making her way over, she couldn't help but actually be happy that her uncle – their boss – was the warden. She was pretty sure her ass would be smacked red by these yee-haws who gave Texas a bad name in her opinion. \"Captain Knauer,\" Emma called over the music, walking up to him. He was fresh out of the shower – water dripping down his leen and yet broad back – with a towel wrapped around his waist as he turned to look at her. Emma – like any woman would – took in his broad and built form; he worked out more than she thought. Uniforms – while hot – could hide a lot or show a lot for a gyuy. Seemed under his uniform the captain was hiding some abs. She'd seen his leen and muscular arms while she'd been forced to sit through their practice by him – having glanced up a few times to uninterestedly watch – but she hadn't seen this. 'Damn,' she thought with annoyance as the Captain – seeming startled by her presence – leaned against the lockers. \"Well well, Emma Hazen. To what do we owe the pleasure?\" he asked, earning a few grins and chuckles from the men, who had all stopped what they were doing to watch. Emma scoffed and handed him the folder. \"Lynette tried to call. You didn't answer, so I took the liberty of helping her deliver this to you,\" she explained evenly as Dunham hovered behind her. She could hear a few childish \"Ooo's\" at her tone as the Captain chuckled, his blue eyes alight with amusement. \"Well thank-ya, darlin. That was mighty kind of ya... But I seem to notice that you don't have an escort. I recall your uncle saying you'd be needing one to move around, didn't he?\" Knauer challenged, much to her irritation. Oh he may be hot but she wanted to slap him. Instead she kept her cool as best she could and smiled sweetly. \"Oh well I looked around the hallway for one, but it seems they're all outside on duty and rather than interrupting any of you from your work, I decided to be brave and go alone. But don't worry, the elevator didn't hassle me at all. Oh, or the doors. They can be so vicious to a woman!\" she gasped mockingly with a glare, arms crossed over her chest. The Captain's eyes flashed with his own irritation as Emma turned and made to leave. \"Sorry to bother you, Captain,\" she finished, pushing through the large men like they were nothing but nats in her way until she made it out the door and growled. \"Ugh! Assholes!\" She stomped to the elevator and slammed her finger into the button, ready to get as far away from Knauer as possible. She didn't care if he went to her uncle or if she was put on room arrest. She hated being talked down to like she was some dumb child. No football boy from Miami who thought he was some born and bread cowpoke was gonna treat her like that! Stomping into the elevator, Emma never felt so happy to actually want to get back the boring old office. -0- \"Oooo-eee! Little miss priss sure aint your number one fan!\" Malloy cackled as Knauer dried his hair and pulled on his clean clothes. He was off today and had opted for jeans, a navy-blue muscle shirt, and his boots. Dunham rolled in with a laugh of his own. \"She's got some stick up her ass alright,\" he cut in, pulling on his uniform shirt. \"Whatja do, Knauer, piss in her cereal?\" Knauer put on deodorant and scoffed. \"Oh she just aint to happy with me getting her in trouble with her dear uncle is all. She'll get over it,\" he waved off before grabbing his phone and stetson and slamming his locker shut before locking it up. The men all nodded or called out goodbyes as he made his way out the locker room. Once out of sight his fist clinched and his knuckles went white, his jaw setting. He wasn't happy. She was a real pain in the ass, Emma. She was fine on the eyes, but she really knew how to grate at nerves. He was tempted to go to the office and get onto her about, once again, disobeying him but he knew this time she wouldn't care. He also had a feeling that it wouldn't be as much since she was running an errand to him for Lynette. ' I want you to make sure she sees the true side of the criminal mind. Want you and your men to help her understand that these... criminals are nothing but animals and not the men she thinks. Understand? ' The warden's words range in his head as he mad it outside. He watched his men practice – the ones now on their free time – and nodded to a few as he made it to the living-quarters. Making his way to his room, he stopped and stared at Emma's door, his halfway opened. He looked around before going to her door and seeing if it was locked. It was. Sighing in frustration, he turned and slid into his room and walked to his fridge. Grabbing a beer, he popped the tab and took a seat on his bed, hitting the remote for his TV. S pike was showing some action movie, but he wasn't paying attention, as an idea formed in his head. -0- Two and a Half Hours Later Emma looked over herself in the reflection of one of Lynette's old school mirrors she kept in her desk and sighed. She hated her nose. She wished she could make it small or something. Anything than the Hazen style nose. \"Oh now stop fretting over things, sweetie. You're as pretty as a flower,\" Lynette assured as Emma returned her mirror. \"Thanks, Lynette,\" she chuckled. The two women shared a smile as Emma looked at the clock. It was almost four-thirty. Meaning freedom for the weekend... Yay? Another weekend of sitting in her room watching The View. That was something she hadn't really taken into account when she came to Allenville; being hauled up for weekends. \" I can't believe you hauled yourself up to Allenville! They have the crappiest record for football!\" her friend Kris had exploded last week when Emma had called her on Skype for entertainment. \"How the hell do you end up with 2 wins a whole season?\" And Emma had to laugh. Kris was a football nut; her father having been a defensive line-man for the Longhorns in his day. He'd never had any sons, so he'd passed it on to Rhonda and her younger sister Jamie. They'd played powder-puff every year with gusto back in high school. Kris had been helpful in herding her boredom that week, but she knew she'd probably be off with her fiancee this week. Meaning Emma was going to need to find something to do. But what? Hmm. Leaning back in her seat she watched Lynette gather her belongings. She was done for this day and this weekend. \"What are you doing this weekend, Lynette?\" she asked as Lynette stuffed away some papers and pulled her purse over her shoulder. \"Oh well me and my ex-husband are taking our niece and nephews out for some fun,\" she gushed happily. \"Would be fun if Grant wasn't gonna be there.\" Emma laughed and got out of her seat as her uncle's door opened as he finished up a conversation on his cellphone. Lynette said goodbye and exited the room, leaving Emma to shift awkwardly. She hadn't talked to her uncle since his new rules. She was still not sure what he had planned, and that made her frustrated. She watched him stuff him close the phone and smiled. \"Emma how would you like to join me and a few of the guards tonight?\" her uncle asked, catching Emma off guard. Wait.. What? \"Um... Excuse me?\" she asked, confused. \"Go out with you and the guards? Where?\" Her uncle beamed and motioned for her to follow him. She stumbled, making sure she had all her stuff, before following him out. Her uncle locked up the office before they were once again making their way down the halls. \"No offense, uncle,\" Emma began with a frown, \"but we don't exactly live near any hot spots... Unless you count miles of desert.\" Her uncle chuckled as they walked down the stares. Outside was nice. The sun was setting and the breeze had picked up. Her hair caught in the wind, pulling a few strands loose as she watched the guards head off to the locker-room to clean up and prepare for night watch. Her uncle pat her shoulder. \"Actually there's a nice bar not to far off called Waterhole that the boys and I are very fond off. I figured you might like to come instead of being held up here for the nice,\" he explained as they neared the door to the living area. Emma tilted her head, surprised. This was certainly nice of him... Which was, once again, out of character! What was he up to? Was this part of his plan? ' Perhaps I should say no,' she thought warily. But the thought of staying in for another weekend – something she hated doing unless she had something to do of importance – sounded worse than what her uncle was planning. Biting her lip in thought, Emma sighed. \"That sounds fun, actually. I'd love to,\" she smiled as they neared the elevator. Her uncle gave a grin as he nodded. They both slipped into the elevator. \"This place have a theme I can dress up to?\" she asked as they descended. Her uncle made a face and Emma rolled her eyes. Of course. Wrong guy to ask. \"What kind of bar is it? Southern or modern or both or what?\" she asked with a chuckle. Realization dawned on his face. \"Oh it's similar to that famous bar out in Missouri – Whiskey Wild Saloon – ya know?\" Actually Emma didn't, but she did still get her answer. Southern style. Booty shorts and tye off shirts tonight. The elevator opened and Emma walked to her door, opening it with her key. She was about to shut her door when she realized something. \"What time are we leaving?\" she asked as her uncle was halfway through his door. \"Oh around seven,\" he answered, before going into his room. Seven, huh? Yeah, that was totally enough time to get ready. She kicked her door closed, locked it, before going to her closet to pick out an outfit. R & R Plz Black Blood Exorcist.. You rock :3 THANKS! Black Blood Exorcist[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I do not own The Longest Yard . At All. I do not own any music or device mentioned. None of it. I do, however, own any new characters that pop up in this story. They are mine. Therefore, please ASK ME before trying to use. Thanks ^^ Authoress Note: This piece takes place just about a few weeks before Paul arrives to Allenville. I am going to do my best to make this enjoyable and readable. I did not do so hot on my first fic for this awesome remake of a classic (total Mary-Sue BS man.. Ugh. It hurts to try and reread it lol). So I will be pushing to make sure this comes out better and less painful for me to reread lol. Extra Note: Well bless my soul! I have some people looking at my story? Yaaay! Oh that makes me smile. Thanks, guys! I am having fun with this, I really am. Even though I did receive a message stating that \"Emma was a bland and overused character\" I still feel happy that people are taking the time to even read the first chapters. Even with my horrible grammatical errors (Which I am aware I have, thank-you \"person-who-will-remain-anonymous\" message sender, lol. But whatever. I'm gonna try my best to keep up! Huzzah! The songs I listened to while writing this were Everybody Loves Me by OneRepublic, Drive By by Train, Theme for Scanty & Kneesocks by TeddyLoid, Bad Boys by Bob Marley (I giggled when this started playing), Bounce Like This by T.I., My Ballz by D12, and American Badass by Kid Rock. Three Hours Later Emma looked herself over in the mirror and frowned. She was having a hard time finding an outfit. Shocker, since she was always buying clothes. Her ex-boyfriends had always bitched about her taking forever to get ready when she had enough clothes for three closets – OK more like two, but whatever – and was always complaining about having nothing! But men didn't get it. Sure she had a lot of clothes, but she didn't have anything to wear for certain events. Like tonight. She was stuck between casual and comfy or classy and comfy. Why did it have to be out with the guards? If she wasn't so annoyed with them and their grabbing and what-not, she would dress however. But she wanted to dress comfortable, but still not leaving herself open for perverse ass smacks or worse. \"... Fuck it,\" she huffed as she glanced at the clock, realizing she had less than thirty minutes to finish up. Walking to her closet Emma grabbed a pair of short cut-off jeans, a white sports-bra under a tied light blue lumber-jack shirt, and her tan boots. She ran her fingers through her hair, giving it a wild-and-tame look before pulling her white stetson hat on. Only a little of her belly was showing and she was always about showing a little leg, so she supposed this was going to be as good as it got. Opting for just a little blush and lip-gloss, Emma had just stuffed her I.D. And phone in her pocket when someone knocked on her door. Shutting off her radio as she hoped around to get her boots all the way on, she made it to the door. \"Sorry! Coming!\" Her chuckle caught in her throat as she opened the door and was greeted with Captain Knauer. He was dressed in jeans, his boots and hat, a black muscle shirt, and a large buckled belt. \"Evenin', miss Hazen,\" he greeted with a true-blue smile – not a cocky grin or a smug smirk – and a tip of his hat. \"Warden asked me to come get ya. He's already at his car.\" Emma nodded dumbly as she shut the door, not bothering to lock it. She had a feeling she'd be getting drunk tonight and would try to kick down her door like she had back in college after finals week had ended. She stared at the back of Knauer's head as they waited for the elevator to open. Like her uncle, Emma found herself wary of the Captain. She had a feeling he and her uncle were working together on whatever they had planned. So she did her best to avoid him since the incident in the locker-room. She had thought he would try to keep from her as well, so the actual smile and showing of manners was unsettling for her. They both stepped into the elevator as it opened. Emma kept an arm's length away as the doors closed and they headed up. They didn't say anything – Emma opting to remain quiet – as she did her best to not stare. She couldn't help it. He fucking looked hot! It was infuriating. Why couldn't he be one of those guys that, once out of uniform, looked like crap. She supposed it had to do with all his years of keeping in shape for football... Come to think of it... She wasn't sure how old he was. She knew he was older than her, but how much so she hadn't really thought on. Perhaps if he didn't irk at her skin every other time they talked she might ask him. Instead she decided to remain quiet. The elevator door opened and the two walked down the hallway and out the door. She followed him to the parking lot where she and her uncle had been let out at her first day and frowned when she noticed her uncle was talking to Dandridge and two other men near two cars parked next to a large Guardsmen bus. As they neared the men, Emma was surprised to find Judge Darrel Lindsay and former Arlen representative Joe Hikstun. Emma was a fan of Judge Lindsay's. He had helped straighten out the big Kissing Kate Bleu case scandal six years back – revealing that miss Bleu was actually really being framed by a the real Kissing Kate; Kissing Kate Landers, a news reporter out to get famous by killing a few men and blaming it on another woman so she could look like the reporter who'd discovered it all. Many speculated that the judge had his hand in the plot, but no evidence could prove otherwise. Emma straightened up and gave her best smile she could muster while silently wishing she was dressed more professional like. \"Ah, here she is. Darrel I'd like you to meet my niece, Emma,\" her uncle beamed, ushering Emma to the judge, \"she's a certified lawyer graduate of Harvard University. She's hoping to uphold the law and make sure those who deserve get what's coming!\" Emma hoped she wasn't grinning like a loon as she shook hands with the judge. \"So,\" he said with a smile, looking her over – though not in the way the guards or inmates had, but with interest – and chuckled, \"you're the niece Reginald's been talking about? Tell me miss Emma, what made you gravitate towards such a responsibility like upholding the judicial system at such a young age?\" She gave a broad smile as she pushed her hair out of her face. \"Oh well... This is embarrassing for me, sir, but it was all because of you,\" she explained, watching his eyes almost twinkle with amusement. \"I've been following your cases for years and well back before I went off to college you had solved the KKB and KKL scandal. I was moved so much that I immediately declared my full interest in becoming a lawyer so I could one day become a judge like yourself once I got more footing with the law.\" A grin spread across the judge's face as he let out a deep laugh. \"Well souee! Joe! Are you hearing this? I told you people respected me still!\" he laughed as Hikstun gave an eye roll and scowl that reminded Emma of her uncle. So that must be why they were friends. Judge Darrel pat her on the shoulder. \"Little lady you keep that attitude up and you'll have my supporting pick of lawyers to represent my firm, ya hear?\" Emma prayed that her jaw hadn't dropped as she nodded dumbly and stuttered, \"y-yes, si-sir!\" as Darrel turned to her uncle. \"Hey! Are we gonna go now? I am starving, Reginald!\" he bellowed as he walked to her uncle's car, dragging Mr. Hukstun along. Her uncle shook his head before looking to Knauer, who had been quietly standing nearby. Oh. She'd forgotten about him. \"Captain, I'll see you and the others tomorrow afternoon for practice I hope,\" he chuckled with a large smile. \"Try not to have too much fun.\" Emma furrowed her brows and turned to watch her uncle walk to his car. \"Wai-wait! Uncle Reginald? You're not coming?\" she exclaimed in disbelief! What was going on? She was going because she thought he'd be around. Her uncle turned and gave her a smile. \"Oh, damn. I thought I told ya. See I was gonna go, but Lindsay and Hikstun called for dinner together and I need to keep my image and favors up with them. Ya understand, right?\" he chuckled before walking back towards his car. She stared wide eyed and shook her head. Oh no! No. Way. In. Hell! Dammit! She should have known. Should have known he'd do this to her. Great. Emma placed her hands on her hips and huffed. \"Well now ya arnt thinkin' of callin' the night a bust, are ya?\" Knauer chuckled as he stepped around her to stop in her line of vision. Emma scowled and shook her head. \"Of course not,\" she lied. Truthfully she'd been thinking of just heading back to her room to sleep. But seeing him act like he knew what she was gonna do and think really jerked her the wrong way. A smirk spread across his face. \"Well alright, then,\" he chuckled, \"lets go.\" He ushered her towards the direction of the Guardsmen bus and she inwardly cringed. Great! Stuck on a bus with the guards for who knows how long. Oh yes. This night was going to be so fucking fabulous... She was pulled from her self-disgust as Knauer walked past the bus to a dark blue Chevrolet Chevelle. She wasn't sure of the year but she guesstimated it had to be 70s or 80s. Knauer opened the door with keys he pulled from his pocket, turning to raise a brow and motion her over with a tilt of his head. Shaking herself from shock – realizing just now that she'd stopped walking – Emma walked over to the front passenger side of the car as he pushed it open from the inside. \"What? No bus?\" she asked, holding the door open and tilting her head. He smirked and motioned for her to get in. Snorting at his cocky attitude all of a sudden, Emma slid into the car and shut the door as she heard the guards yelling obscenities to Knauer and her as the bus began to head out. Knauer just waved at them before turning on the car. He flipped on the radio – Paradise by the Dashboard Light blaring – before putting the car in reverse and backing up. Emma put on her seat-belt and crossed her arms as he switched gears and headed off, nodding to the gate-check as they shot out. She shimmied down in her seat and stared out the window. She heard Knauer humming along to Meatloaf and she had to fight to not laugh. She'd never take him for knowing Meatloaf. She shook her head and looked at the dark, star filled, sky as Knauer neared the bus. \"To answer your question, miss Emma,\" Knauer spoke up, turning the radio down. \"we usually take the bus so we can all go out and have fun while still having someone to drive us back.\" Emma absently nodded her head but remained silent. She felt him glancing at her as she sat up a little in her seat and rolled down her window, the desert's cooling breeze feeling nice as it slapped against her face. She heard Knauer chuckle aloud beside her as she draped her arm out the window. Raising a brow she turned to look at him. \"What's so funny, Captain?\" she asked, slightly disturbed by the random giggling he was practically doing next to her. He shook his head and cracked another one of his famous grins. \"Well now I was just thinking. I think I know why you don't like me,\" he drawled, causing her to roll her eyes. He really needed to drop the wannabe cowboy act. \"I don't like you, Captain, because you're an obnoxious asshole,\" she clarified for him. He just chuckled and shook his head. \"Well that may be, but I bet I know there's another reason for it.\" Emma tilted her head and turned to look at him again. \"Oh, really?\" she asked, scoffing lightly and pushing strands of hair out of her face. \"Why's that?\" He draped his hand over the wheel and gave a two finger greeting to Papajohn as him and Dunham made crude gestures. Emma did her best to ignore them as she continued to wait for Knauer's next response. \"Well it's because you and I are a lot a like!\" he exclaimed cheerfully. Emma stared at him as if he'd grown two heads with horns and a tail! What? She was nothing like him! \"You and I are nothing alike, Captain,\" she sputtered, mouth ajar. This man was out of his blooming mind. Knauer just gave another chuckle and shook his head. Dunham made a gesture of humping the air as he stood from his seat and grinned and Emma – having enough of his shit – flipped him off. She could hear the whole bus go into an uproar ahead of them as they all slapped fives and Dunham gave her a big shit-eating grin. She fucking hated these men so much. \"Now see that's where you're wrong, Emma,\" he explained finally, surprising her. When did he get so formal with her? What, no more \"miss\" Emma now? \"See you and I are alike 'cause we're both stubborn. Ya hate ta loose and so do I. We're also both working for the good side of the law... And we're both fine citizen's of Texas who respect your uncle. And there's more but I think you get the drift.\" Emma burst into laughter. Was he for real? \"First of all, Captain, we may both be stubborn but unlike you I'm not an ass about it,\" she began, ticking her fingers off, \"secondly you may work for the law but I've seen your ideal of \"justice\" and I gotta say I don't approve,\" she saw his expression harden as she sneered at him. \"Third, Captain, you're about as much of a real Texan as a fake tan, Mr. Miami,\" she scoffed. \"Oh, yes. I've read your file. Miami Florida. Miami University Dolphins. Born and raised superstar. That wannabe cowpoke you got goin is mighty decent, though, I'll admit. What you practice in-front of a mirror every day, Brian ,\" she flipped her hair out of her face as the wind caught it, her arms crossed as she practically spit out his name. If he was gonna throw formalities around then two could play that game. She watched his knuckles tighten as he gripped the wheel, but remained quiet. Good. Maybe he'd learn to shut-up from now on. Emma leaned against the door and stuck her head slightly out the window. This night wasn't going at all like she wanted. She knew being with the guards was going to suck, butr now it just plain reeked and she couldn't wait to get back to Allenville. R & R Plz I apologize for not having updated in so long, you guys. I lost motivation for awhile. Hopefully – least it looks like – it's gonna pick up again. I'll maybe watch the movie a few good times or something :] ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own The Longest Yard . At All. I do not own any music or device mentioned.

Chapter 1: Boarding the Polar Express One peaceful Christmas eve I was laying down in my bed,and I was waiting for Santa to come to my house to deliver the christmas presents that he asked me for what I wanted this year for Christmas. Meanwhile,Outside I heard a noise of a train coming to my house. As the train approached I quietly woke up,and got up out of bed. I put my slippers on,and I grabbed my nice,fluffy warm pink housecoat,and I put it on. I slowly walked out of my bedroom down the stairs,and out into the living room. I opened up the front door as the train stops in front of my house. I quietly walk outside,and I close the door behind me. I slowly walk off of the porch,and down the snowy sidewalk. I walk over to the train,and the conductor gets off of the train for a few minutes. I exclaim,\"Hi Mr. Conductor my name is Sally,and I've never ridden on a train before.\" Mr. Conductor responds back to me,\"Well hello there Sally my name is Wayne,and I'll be your conductor this evening. This train isnt just any train its a magical train called the Polar Express which will take you on a journey to the North Pole,and back to see Santa Claus.\" \"I've never been to the north pole before,and I haven't really celebrated Christmas before either. This is my first year celebrating Christmas.\" \"Well get aboard the train then,and the Polar Express will take you on an adventure,and a journey that you'll never forget what do you say?\" \"I say yes it sounds like fun.\" \"All aboard the Polar Express.\" I walk up the steps to the passenger train car of the Polar Express,and I walk down the aisle until I find an empty seat where I can sit down at. I sit down in an empty seat,and I look out the window as the train starts to move away from my house.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Meeting Chris,Holly,and Billy for the first time Meanwhile,on the Polar Express there are other children on the train. A girl with pigtail braids comes over to where I am sitting,and she's got two boys with her. The girl talks to me for a few minutes. Holly exclaims to me,\"Hi my name is Holly what's your name?\" I respond back to Holly,\"Hi my name is Sally,and its nice to meet you Holly.\" \"It's nice to meet you to Sally. You're sitting all alone are you okay,and you look kind of sad what's wrong Sally?\" \"Well Holly this is my first year celebrating Christmas,and I've never ridden on any kind of train before.\" \"Oh Okay well its a great train this particular train is called the Polar Express,and it takes us to the north pole to see Santa Claus.\" \"Yes,the conductor has already told me about the train its a magical train I know.\" \"Oh Okay,and these are my two friends Chris,and Billy.\" \"Hi Chris,and Hi Billy its nice to meet the both of you boys.\" \"Hi Sally its nice to meet you to.\" \"We were looking for places to sit,and we were wondering if we could sit here by you Sally.\" \"Yes,you three may sit by me because I could use the company on this trip I'm kind of lonely.\" \"Ok,we will sit by you,and be your friends.\" \"Ok,I like the idea of having some friends to talk to.\" \"We do to this is our first year riding on the Polar Express to.\" \"Ok.\" Holly,Chris,and Billy sit down next to me. Holly sits down on the seat next to me. Chris,and Billy sit down on the seat across from Holly,and I. \"Don't lose your ticket Sally the conductor will be coming by in a few minutes to collect our tickets,so make sure that you have it ready.\" \"Ok,Thanks Holly I've got my ticket right here.\" \"Ok.\" A few minutes later Mr. Conductor is walking down the aisle collecting the tickets. He comes over to where Holly,Billy,Chris,and I are sitting. The conductor talks to the four of us. Mr. Conductor exclaims to Holly,Chris,Billy,and I,\"Tickets tickets please I need your tickets.\" Holly,Billy,Chris,and I respond back to the conductor,\"Here are our tickets Mr. Conductor.\" The four of us hand our tickets over to the conductor,and he punches holes in our tickets. When he is finished he hands our tickets back to us. I look at my ticket,and it has the letters Be stamped into it. I exclaim to Holly,Billy,and Chris,\"are these tickets magical or something? My ticket has the letters Be in it.\" Holly,Billy,and Chris respond back to me,\"Yes,these tickets are magical just like this train is magical. My ticket just has a b on it. My ticket has the letters Le in it. And my ticket has the letters depe on it.\" \"What's with all of the letters on our tickets?\" \"You'll see at the end of the trip the letters on our tickets will spell out a word,or two depending on what the conductor puts on our tickets. Hang on to your tickets,and make sure that you don't lose them.\" \"Ok,I'll put my ticket in my pocket,so I know where it is.\" \"Good idea.\" I check my pocket to make sure that there aren't any holes in it,and my pocket is good to go there are no holes in my pocket. I put my ticket into my pocket,so I know where it is for later on. Holly talks to me for a little while longer. Holly exclaims to me,\"So what's this about that this is your first year celebrating Christmas Sally?\" I respond back to Holly,\"Its kind of a sad story Holly.\" \"Oh ok well if you don't want to tell me then you don't have to.\" \"Ok,but I want to tell someone.\" \"Go ahead then.\" \"This is my first year celebrating Christmas because I have lived in an orphanage since my parents have died,and I never knew what Christmas was,and I still don't know what Christmas is all about.\" \"I can tell you what Christmas is all about if you want me to Sally.\" \"Sure I'd like to know what Christmas is all about Holly,and that's nice of you to do that Thank you.\" \"You're welcome,and the season of Christmas is all about Jesus being born,and laying in a manger. His mother Mary gives birth to him in a stable where animals live because there is no room for them in the inn. Christmas is also about getting together with family,and friends. Having a good time,and Christmas is also all about giving to others who may not be as fortunate as you are. Family members might sometimes give gifts to one another to show them that they care about,and love one another.\" \"Thank you Holly Christmas sounds like a very interesting holiday to celebrate.\" \"You're welcome Sally,and yes it is Christmas is also a magical time of the year where Santa comes,and leaves christmas presents for you under your Christmas tree.\" \"Ok.\" \"We will be meeting Santa at the north pole tonight.\" \"Yes,I know that we will.\" \"Ok.\" A few minutes later the conductor comes out to check on all of us to see how we are doing,and we are doing just fine. He decides to offer us some refreshments while we are on the train on out way to the North Pole to meet Santa Claus.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Having hot cocoa,and cookies on the Polar Express Meanwhile,the conductor talks to the kids on the train for a few minutes. He tells them that there are refreshments ready for us. Mr. Conductor exclaims to Holly,Billy,Chris,and I,\"there's refreshments if you want some we've got hot cocoa,and cookies ready for anyone who would like some refreshments.\" Holly,Billy,Chris,and I respond back to the conductor,\"We'd like some hot cocoa,and cookies please Mr. Conductor.\" \"Sure I'll be back in a few minutes with your hot cocoa,and cookies.\" \"Thank you Mr. Conductor.\" \"You're welcome kids.\" A few minutes later the conductor comes back out and he serves the four of us kids our hot cocoa,and cookies. He makes sure that all of the kids on the train get some hot cocoa,and cookies as a refreshment. After all of the kids have been served he goes back through the door to the back part of the train. Holly,Billy,Chris,and I drink our hot cocoa,and we eat our cookies. We talk while we eat our refreshments. Holly talks to me for a little while. Holly exclaims to me,\"This hot cocoa is good,and so are these cookies aren't they?\" I respond back to Holly,\"Yes,the cocoa is nice,and warm. The cookies are fresh out of the oven. Yummy,and delicious.\" \"Sally can I ask you a question?\" \"Yes,Holly you can ask me anything you want to.\" \"Ok I hope that you don't mind me asking thus,but how did your parents die,and when did they die?\" \"My parents died in a house fire it was a severe tragedy.\" \"Ok,and I'm so sorry to hear that Sally.\" \"It's ok Holly,and I lost everything. All of my clothes,books,toys,and games were gone.\" \"That's so sad,and how did the house fire start?\" \"Well there was a gas leak in our house,and my mom went to go cook dinner on the stove,and it blew up the house,and set the house on fire. I got out in time,but my parents didn't. They suffered,and died in the house while it exploded,and was on fire.\" \"Wow,that is so sad Sally.\" \"Yes,I know that it is,and my parents died in between Halloween,and Thanksgiving of this year. They didn't die on Thanksgiving which was good.\" \"Yes,that's the good part,but I can tell Sally that the holidays are rough for you without having your parents around,and alive to celebrate them with you.\" \"Yes,Holly it is,and it has been rough,but I've gotten through it. I've still got my grandma,and grandpa around,and I celebrate the holidays with them since I am now living at their house.\" \"That's nice Sally that's really nice.\" \"Yes,it is.\" A few minutes later Holly,Billy,Chris,and I are finished drinking our hot cocoa,and eating our cookies. All of the kids are finished with their refreshments. The conductor comes back out into the passenger car,and he collects all of the cups,and plates from the cookies,and hot cocoa. He takes them all back into the kitchen,so they can all get washed. It isn't long after that when the Polar Express arrives at the North Pole. Holly,Billy,Chris,and I look out the windows of the train,and we look at all of the beautiful christmas decorations. We even get to look at the beautiful christmas tree that Santa's elves have put up,and decorated. Holly talks to me for a few minutes. Holly exclaims to me,\"Look at that Sally isn't that beautiful the christmas tree. It's so beautiful all decorated,and lighted up.\" I respond back to Holly,\"Yes,it is,and it is very beautiful the way that it is. Look over there Holly there's Santa's sleigh,and his reindeer.\" \"Yes,and how beautiful is that.\" \"It's very nice.\" \"Yes,it is.\" A few minutes later the conductor comes back out into the passenger car where all of us kids are,and he talks to us for a few minutes. He gives us some rules to follow while we go see Santa Claus.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Arriving at the North Pole A few minutes later the Polar Express stops where it is supposed to stop,and the conductor gives us a few rules to follow as we are getting off of the train. Mr. Conductor exclaims to Holly,Billy,Chris,and I,\"When you get off of the train you are to form a line. Shortest kids in the front,and taller kids in the back. Each of you will get a chance to see Santa. Stay in line until it is your turn to see Santa Claus. Santa gives out the first gift if Christmas to one lucky child. If he chooses to give you the first gift of Christmas you are the first kid to see Santa Claus tonight. Please follow all of these rules thank you.\" Holly,Billy,Chris,and I respond back to the conductor,\"Ok Mr. Conductor we will follow the rules,and we will be good,and do as you have told us to do,and you're welcome Mr. Conductor.\" All of the kids get up out of their seats,and they get off of the train. Holly,Billy Chris,and I get up out of our seats,and we get off of the train. We walk carefully down the steps of the train,and we get into the line like we were supposed to do. Santa's reindeer start moving around,and a bell falls off of the reins if the reindeer. I see the shiny gold bell roll across the ground,and it lands right in front of my feet. I bend over to pick it up,and I look at it. I hold it in my hand for a few minutes. I close my eyes,and I say to myself,\"I believe in the true spirit of Christmas.\" I shake the bell,and I can hear it make a jingleling sound. I say to myself again \"I believe in the true spirit of Christmas.\" I shake the bell a second time,and I can hear it jingle. Santa Claus comes walking out,and I hold onto the bell,so I can give it back to him. Santa Claus talks to me for a few minutes. Santa Claus exclaims to me,\"I heard you say something,and what was that you said?\" I respond back to Santa,\"I said that I believe in the true spirit of Christmas.\" \"and I heard a jingling noise what was that noise,and where did it come from?\" \"I was shaking a jingle bell. It fell off of your reindeers harness,and I picked it up because it belongs to you,and I was going to give it back to you sir. I wasn't going to keep it because it doesn't belong to me. I have never heard a jingle bell before,and this is my first year celebrating Christmas.\" \"What's your name little girl?\" \"My name is Sally Mr. Claus.\" \"It's nice to meet you Sally.\" \"It's nice to meet you to Santa.\" \"Can I see the bell for a minute?\" \"Sure Santa here you go.\" I hand the bell back to Santa. He lifts it high up in the air,and he jingles it for everyone to hear. Santa talks to everyone for a few minutes. He talks to all of the kids,and the elves. Santa exclaims to everyone,\"ladies,and gentlemen,boys,and girls of all ages. I proudly present the first gift of Christmas to Sally here this year. She has won the first gift of Christmas.\" Everyone cheers for me,and I talk to Santa for a few minutes. \"I receive the first gift of Christmas,and what's the first gift of Christmas?\" \"This bell that you found is the first gift of Christmas,and I'm letting you have it.\" \"I can keep it?\" \"Yes,that you can.\" \"Why can I keep it?\" \"Because I am giving it to you for christmas,and don't worry by tomorrow morning you'll have what you asked me for under your Christmas tree.\" \"Thank you Santa,and its a joy to be here tonight. I lost everything including my parents in a terrible house fire a few weeks ago,and I haven't ever celebrated Christmas before because I've lived in an orphanage,and I didn't get to celebrate Christmas there.\" \"Well Merry Christmas Sally.\" \"Merry Christmas to you to Santa.\" Santa hands me the bell,and I make sure that there isn't a hole in my pocket. I put my bell into my pocket,so I won't lose it. The other children get in line to see,and talk to Santa Claus. Chris recieves the second gift of Christmas a shiny silver bell from Santa's sleigh. He puts it in his pocket,so he doesn't lose it. After a while it is time for all of us to leave. We get back onto the train,and we sit back down in our seats. The engineer starts up the train,and we start to leave from the north pole to go back home. The conductor comes by,and he collects all of our tickets. He punches holes in all of our tickets. The train conductor talks to us all. Mr. Conductor exclaims to Chris,Billy,Holly,and I,\"Tickets please I need your tickets.\" Chris,Billy,Holly,and I respond back to him,\"Here are our tickets Mr. Conductor.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" We hand him our tickets,and he punches holes in our tickets. He talks to us for a few minutes after he punches holes in our tickets. Mr. Conductor exclaims to Chris,Billy,Holly,and I,\"each ticket is magical,and it has a word,or words on it please read me what is says on your tickets.\" Holly,Chris,Billy,and I look at our tickets,and we see words on our tickets. \"My ticket says depend on,rely on,and count on.\" \"Very nice Billy that's one special ticket that you've got there Billy.\" \"Yes,it is.\" \"My ticket says lead.\" \"I'll follow you anywhere you want to go Holly,and nicely done. Lead is for leadership,and you have learned that tonight Holly.\" \"Thank you Mr. Conductor.\" \"You're welcome Holly.\" \"My ticket says believe.\" \"Very well done Chris you've learned to believe in your heart tonight Chris.\" \"Thank you Mr. Conductor.\" \"You're welcome Chris.\" \"And my ticket says believe in the true spirit of Christmas.\" \"Very nicely done Sally,that's what you've learned tonight haven't you?\" \"Yes,I have Mr. Conductor,and thank you.\" \"You're welcome Sally.\" The train stops at Billy's house,and it is time for Billy to get off of the train. Holly,Chris,and I wish Billy a Merry Christmas,and so does the conductor. Billy gets off of the Polar Express,and he goes into his house. He finds his christmas present underneath the tree that Santa has left for him. The train pulls away from Billy's house,and it stops at Chris's house next. It is time for Chris to get off of the train. Holly,and I wish Chris a Merry Christmas,and so does the conductor. The train makes its way away from Chris's,house,and it goes to my house next,but there is a problem when the train stops in front of my grandparents house. Holly,and I look out the window of the train to see what is going on.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Arriving back at my house I carefully look all around,and all I see is firefighters at my grandparents house,but I don't see any signs of my grandparents anywhere. I look up at my grandparents house,and its all up in flames from a fire. I exclaim to Holly,\"look at this house it's all in flames,and my grandparents aren't anywhere around. I can't go home now because I have no home that was my home,but now its gone.\" Holly responds back to me,\"What are you going to do?\" \"I don't know what I'm going to do now. It's Christmas eve and I don't have a home to go to.\" \"I'll tell you what Sally you can stay with me at my house.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes,I'm sure its Christmas,and I'm not letting you not have a place to go on Christmas.\" \"Ok.\" A few minutes later the conductor comes back to where I am sitting,and he talks to me for a few minutes. Mr. Conductor exclaims to me,\"Sally I talked to one of the firefighters,and they said that your grandparents didn't make it out if the house in time. They died in the fire which got started while they were asleep. An arsonist came up,and set the house on fire. It's a good thing that you weren't there.\" I respond back to Mr. Conductor,\"Ok,I didn't see them around anywhere,so I know that something was wrong. That's not right that an arsonist would set a house on fire on Christmas eve. Yes it is,but nos I've lost everything once again,and I have no home now either.\" \"I know that,but its Christmas,and we will find you a place to stay at you're not going to not have a home not on Christmas.\" \"Ok,I was talking to Holly,and she said that I could stay at her house for Christmas.\" \"Holly that was very nice of you to do that thank you.\" \"You're welcome Mr. Conductor.\" A few minutes later the Polar Express stops in front of Holly's house. Holly,and I both get up out of our seats,and we get off of the train. We carefully walk down the steps,and we walk up to the front door of Holly's house. The conductor talks to us for a few minutes before the train drives off. Mr. Conductor exclaims to Holly,and I,\"Merry Christmas.\" Holly,and I respond back to Mr. Conductor,\"Merry Christmas to you to Mr. Conductor.\" The train drives off as Holly,and I walk into her house. We both walk over to the christmas tree,and we see our presents underneath her tree. Santa leaves my presents under the tree at Holly's house. He kept them safe from the fire. Holly,and I close,and lock up the front door to her house,and we both walk upstairs to her bedroom. We walk into the bedroom,and we close the bedroom door behind us. I see that a sleeping bag,pillows,and blanket have been set up for me on the floor in Holly's bedroom. She lays down in her bed,and I lay down in the bed that has been made up for me on the floor. I make sure to take my bell out of my pocket before I take my housecoat off. I take my slippers off to. Holly,and I lay down,and we go to sleep for the night in Holly's bedroom. I cry myself to sleep because now my grandparents are gone as well. My parents are gone to. I fall asleep for the night in Holly's bedroom. Holly falls asleep for the night as well. The bell only rings for those who truly believe in the true spirit of Christmas. Holly,and I will get to open our christmas presents that Santa has left for us tomorrow morning when we wake up.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Christmas Day at Holly's house The next morning at Holly's house her,and I both woke up,and we got up out of bed. We walked out into the hallway outside of Holly's bedroom,and we walk down the stairs one at a time. A few minutes later we are both standing on the floor of the living room. We look over in the corner,and we see christmas presents underneath the christmas tree. Holly's mom,and dad are awake,and they come downstairs to. Holly's mom,and dad see us out in the living room looking at the christmas tree,and seeing all of our presents underneath the christmas tree. Holly's moms name is Molly,and Holly's dads name is Patrick. They come and talk to Holly for a few minutes. Molly,and Patrick exclaim to Holly,and I,\"Good morning girls,and Merry Christmas.\" Holly,and I respond back to Molly,and Patrick,\"Good morning,and Merry Christmas to you to.\" \"Thank you girls.\" \"You're welcome,and thank you.\" \"You're welcome girls,and Holly who is your friend there? Where did she come from?\" \"Mom,and dad this is my friend Sally she rode on the Polar Express with the rest of the kids last night. When we got back to her house the house was all up in flames,and her grandparents didn't make it out of the house in time. They were asleep when the fire had started.\" \"Oh Ok,and its nice to meet you Sally.\" \"It's nice to meet you to Molly,and Patrick.\" \"Thank you Sally.\" \"You're welcome,and thank you.\" \"You're welcome Sally,and where are your parents at Sally?\" \"My parents are dead,and they died in a house fire a few weeks ago between Halloween,and Thanksgiving. There were explosions,and a fire due to a gas leak in the house. My parents couldn't make it out of the house in time,but I managed to make it out of the house,but I was the only one that had made it out.\" \"That's sad Sally,and that's very sad its a good thing though that you made it out of the house where your parents lived.\" \"Yes,it is,and this is my first year celebrating Christmas,and last night was my first trip up to the north pole to meet Santa Claus. I didn't even know what Christmas was until Holly told me about what Christmas was all about,and who it is about.\" \"You've never celebrated Christmas before Sally?\" 'No,I haven't because after my parents died I was sent to live in an orphanage for a while until my grandma,and grandpa took me into their home,and got me out of the orphanage.\" \"Aw,you poor little girl,and how old are you Sally?\" \"I'm only seven years old.\" \"Do you have any brothers or sisters Sally?\" \"No,I am an only child I have no brothers and sisters.\" \"How would you like to stay here with Holly,and us we'd take very good care of you.\" \"I'd like that a lot I need a new home since mine is gone from a fire twice now that's happened I've lost everything. All I've got is a special bell that Santa gave to me as the first gift of Christmas last night up at the North Pole.\" \"Well,you've got a new home here with us if you'd like to stay,and we can't make you stay that's you're choice if you want to stay,or not.\" \"Yes,I'm choosing to stay I like this house,and I like you guys to.\" \"Welcome home Sally,and Merry Christmas.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome,and you can sleep in Holly's room until we get a bedroom prepared for you to sleep in then you'll have your own bedroom.\" \"Thank you once again.\" \"You're welcome Sally,and now it's time for you two girls to open up your Christmas presents,and it looks like you've got plenty of them.\" \"Alright lets open up some presents.\" \"Yea,let's open up some presents.\" Holly,and I sit down on the living room floor,and we take turns opening up the gifts that Santa has left for us. I get some new toys,and some new clothes. I get a brand new sheet,and blanket set for my bed. Holly gets some new clothes as well. She also gets a brand new barbie doll to play with. My presents include a brand new barbie doll,and a barbie car. A Ken doll,and Ken clothes. Clothes for barbie,and shoes for both barbie,and Ken. Holly recieves a brand new horse,and a riding outfit for her barbie. I receive a horse,and a riding outfit as well for barbie. I also get a doctors kit,and outfit for both barbie,and Ken. I receive a doctors office for both Ken,and barbie to work in. A few minutes later Holly,and I are finished with opening up our christmas presents that were underneath the christmas tree. We get to look in our stockings next,and see what Santa has left for us in our stockings. In my stocking I get a candy cane,and a barbie deck of playing cards. Holly gets a candy cane,and a horse deck of playing cards. We take all of our gifts upstairs,and we put them away in Holly's room for the time being. We keep them separate from each other because once I get my own bedroom I can put my toys away in my own bedroom. Holly,and I get dressed before we go back downstairs. I put on my new Christmas sweater,my new blue jeans,and a brand new pair of Christmas socks that I just got for Christmas. Holly puts on a Christmas sweater,jeans,and Christmas socks as well to go with her outfit. A few minutes later Holly,and I are both dressed,and we go back downstairs for our Christmas day breakfast with Holly's mom,and dad. We walk down the stairs one at a time,and a few minutes later the both of us are back downstairs out in the living room.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Eating breakfast on Christmas day at Holly's house Holly's mom Molly walks out into the kitchen,and she gets the Christmas day breakfast cooking for all of us at Holly's house. Molly makes pancakes,and bacon for breakfast. While breakfast is cooking Molly gets the table set for breakfast. A few minutes later breakfast is ready. Molly calls all of us out into the kitchen,so we can eat out breakfast. Molly exclaims to Holly,Patrick,and I,\"Breakfast is ready its time to eat breakfast.\" Patrick,Holly,and I respond back to Molly,\"Ok we are coming.\" \"Ok.\" Holly,Patrick,and I get up off of the couch,and we walk out into the dinning room. We sit down at the table as Holly's mom serves us our breakfast. Molly sits down,and she joins us for breakfast. Holly's mom,and dad talk to Holly,and I for a few minutes as we eat our Christmas day breakfast. Molly,and Patrick exclaim to Holly,and I,\"We got to talking,and we decided that Sally is to stay here with us. She has no home,and no more relatives that are willing to take care of her. She now has a new home here with us,and she is to stay here with us.\" Holly,and I respond back to Molly,and Patrick,\"that's wonderful,and that's great thank you so much.\" \"You're welcome. You girls are like sisters,and we can't separate the two of you Holly is an only child,and she has no brothers or sisters. Now with you being here Sally Holly has someone that she can spend time with,and someone that she can do things with. She will be a great sister to you,and we are hoping that you can be a great sister to her as well.\" \"Oh I will be Holly is really nice,and she's the best sister there is. We will be able to get along just fine.\" \"Yes,I know that you will be able to you girls get along so well together.\" \"How come you didn't say anything to us before now about this?\" \"We wanted to surprise you girls on Christmas day.\" \"Oh,Ok,and I was definantly surprised we both were.\" \"That's food,and after breakfast you girls are to pack your bags. Take some toys,and books with you.\" \"Why where are we going?\" \"You girls are going to Holly's grandmas house for a few days. If Sally is going to be staying here with us she will need her own bedroom. We've got to get the spare bedroom upstairs ready for her,and grandma has requested to meet Sally,and see her for the first time.\" \"Oh,ok,but aren't you coming with us?\" \"Yea,we will be there for Christmas day today,and come home later on in the evening.\" \"Oh,Okay.\" Holly,and I finish eating our breakfast. We get up from the table,and we put our dirty dishes in the sink. We walk out of the kitchen,and we go upstairs to Holly's bedroom. We go into her bedroom,and we both get out an overnight bag. Both of us girls pack our overnight bags. We pack our clothes,pajamas,toothbrush,tooth paste,and some of our coloring books,and toys.

Patrick,and Molly exclaim to Holly,and I,\"Girls we've got God news for you.\" Holly,and I respond back to Patrick,and Molly,\"Ok,mom,and dad what's the good news?\" \"Sally now has her own bedroom we painted it yesterday,and then laid the carpeting she's got a bed,and a dresser in her room,so its time that we move Sally into her new bedroom.\" \"Ok,mom,and dad.\" Patrick,Molly,Holly,and I get up from the couch,and my sister,and I get our bags,and our pillows. All four of us walk up the stairs one at a time. A few minutes later all four of us are upstairs. We are standing in the hallway outside of my new bedroom. I see a ribbon tied across the doorway. I exclaim to Molly,and Patrick,\"Mom,and dad do I get to cut the ribbon?\" Molly,and Patrick respond back to me,\"Yes,sweetheart its your bedroom,so yes you get to cut the ribbon.\" \"Ok,thanks mom,and thanks dad.\" \"You're welcome sweetheart.\" \"Are we ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"On the count of three I'll cut the ribbon.\" \"Ok,one.\" \"Two.\" \"Three.\" I cut the ribbon with a pair of scissors,and mom helps dad to untie the rest of the ribbon from my bedroom doorway. Mom,and dad walk back down the hallway towards the stairs. They talk to Holly,and I for a few minutes. Molly,and Patrick exclaim to Holly,and I,\"let us know girls if you need anything we will be downstairs.\" Holly,and I respond back to Molly,and Patrick,\"Ok mom,and ok dad we will let you know if we need anything.\" \"Ok,girls. Sally there's a sheet set,and blanket laying on your bed,and you've got choices of sheet sets,and blanket sets in the closet on the shelf so you can choose which sheet,and blanket set you'd like on your bed. When you are finished please out the others back away in the closet. Holly you are to help your sister out make sure she has everything out of your room that belongs to her,so she can put it away in her own bedroom.\" \"Ok,thanks mom,and thanks dad.\" \"You're welcome girls.\" Mom,and dad take turns one at a time walking down the stairs,and a few minutes later both of them are downstairs. Holly,and I go into my new bedroom,and I look all around my new bedroom. I've got a brand new bed to sleep on,a brnad new dresser to put my clothes in,and a brand new shelf to put my toys,and books away on. I walk over to my bed,and I see the sheet set,and blanket that ha been laid out on my bed. I set my bag,and pillows down for a few minutes,so I can make my bed. First I put the sheet set on my bed,and then I take the dirty pillowcases off of my bed,and I put them into my laundry hamper. I put the pillowcases on my pillows that match the sheet set that I just put onto my bed. After I put my pillowcases on my pillows I put them on my bed. I then unfold my blanket that matches my sheet set and I spread the blanket across my bed. My bed has now been made,and I sit on my bed it is nice,and comfortable. I unzip my bag,and I take my clean clothes out of my bag,and I put them away in my dresser drawer. I put my beads,and my friendship making stirng on my shelf on the shelf that is marked craft supplies. I then take my dirty pajamas out of the bag,and I put them into my laundry hamper. I take my bag of diapers out of my overnight bag,and I put the bag where I can find it. I take my toothbrush,and toothpaste out of my overnight bag,and I get up off of my bed. I walk down the hallway towards the bathroom. I put my toothbrush,and toothpaste away in the bathroom. After I put my bathroom supplies away I walk down the hallway towards Holly's bedroom,and I walk into her bedroom. Holly is busy putting her clean clothes away in her dresser drawers. She is busy unpacking from her visit to her grandmas house. I take my box that has some of my toys,and some of my books that has my name on it,and Holly grabs the other box that has the rest of my toys,and books in it. We take both boxes into my new bedroom,and we put them on my bed. We unpack one box at a time,and we put my games,toys,and books away on my shelf that mom,and dad made for me. We put my books on the shelf marked books,we put my games on the shelf marked games,and we put my toys on the shelf marked toys. I have everything out of Holly's bedroom,and a few minutes later both of us are unpacked from our visit at Grandma Becky's house.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16: Lunchtime at my new house A few minutes later Holly,and I are finished with putting everything away in my brand new bedroom. We both walk out into the hallway,and we take turns one at a time walking down the stairs. A few minutes later both of us are back downstairs. We both walk out into the dinning room,and we sit down at the dinning room table. Molly starts getting lunch cooked,and while lunch is cooking she sets the table for lunch. A few minutes later lunch is ready,and Molly sits down at the table to eat lunch with us. Patrick sits down at the table,and he joins us for lunch. All four of us eat our lunch together. Molly,and Patrick talk to Holly,and I for a few minutes while we are all eating our lunch. Molly,and Patrick exclaim to Holly,and I,\"Did you two girls get everything of Sally's out of Holly's bedroom,and put away on Sally's new bedroom?\" Holly,and I respond back to Molly,and Patrick,\"Yes mom,and dad we did.\" \"Did you get your brand new bed made up Sally,and did you put everything away in your room where it goes?\" \"Yes,mom,and dad I did.

I get up from the table,and I put my dirty dishes in the sink. I walk out into the living room,and I feel the sudden urge to have to go pee,and I really feel like I have to poop. I start to pee in my diaper,and then I start pooping in my diaper after I finish peeing. I feel a second urge to poop,and I poop again in my diaper. I still feel like I have to poop,so I poop a third time in my diaper. The poop starts coming out,and I can't stop it from happening because I can't control it. I poop in my diaper until I start to fill it up. I walk from the living room over to the stairs. I walk upstairs,and I have to poop a little bit more,so I poop in my diaper yet again. I walk from the hallway into my bedroom,and I get out my wipes. I get out a fresh diaper to. I really feel like I have to pee,so I pee some more in my diaper. I can't hold it in any longer,so I start pooping in my diaper. I poop,and I poop some more in my diaper. Finally I am finished,and my diaper is full. I exit my bedroom,and I walk down the hallway towards the bathroom. I walk into the bathroom,and I close the door behind me. I pull my pants down,and I take my full diaper off. I throw it away in the trash. I get a wipe,and I get myself all cleaned up. I throw the used wipes away in the trash. I put my fresh,clean diaper on,and I pull my pants back up. I walk over to the sink,and I turn on the water. I wash my hands with warm water,and soap. I rinse my hands off,and dry them on the towel. After my hands are dry I walk over to the bathroom door,and I open it back up. I exit the bathroom,and I go back out into the hallway. I walk towards the stairs,and I walk back downstairs. Holly,Molly,and Patrick are finished with eating their lunch,and they get up from the table. They put their dirty dishes in the sink,and Holly walks out into the living room where I am at. I walk over from the stairs,and I sit down on the couch. Holly comes to talk to me for a few minutes. Holly exclaims to me,\"Mom,and dad says since we've got nothing else to do we can go upstairs,and have fun. Let's go upstairs,and go play.\" I respond back to Holly,\"Ok,what are we going to play?\" \"Do you have any Barbies?\" \"Yes,I've got barbies I got a new one for Christmas with a horse.\" \"So did I want to play barbies with me sis?\" \"Yes,let's do it in my new bedroom I want you to see my new bedroom.\" \"Ok,sis lets go.\" \"Ok.\" Holly,and I get up from the couch,and we walk upstairs one at a time. A few minutes later we are both upstairs. I go into my new bedroom,and I get my barbies out. I sit down on the floor by my bed. Holly walks into her bedroom,and she gets her barbies out. She walks back out of her bedroom,and she brings her barbies into my new bedroom. She sits down on the floor with me,and we play with our barbies together for a while. We spend some time together as sisters.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17: Spending some time with my sister Holly Meanwhile,back downstairs mom,and dad are out in the kitchen doing the dishes. Mom puts water,and soap in the sink,and she starts washing the dishes. Dad dries the dishes for her,and he puts the dishes away where they go after they are clean,and dry. Mom,and dad talk to one another for a few minutes while they are doing the dishes. Patrick exclaims to Molly,\"Where are the girls at? Did they go upstairs to play for a while?\" Molly responds back to Patrick,\"Yes,they must have gone upstairs to play Holly asked me if she could play with her sister for a while since they've got nothing else to do.\" \"Oh,ok because I just heard them out in the living room a few minutes ago,and now they aren't there. They went upstairs to play for a while.\" \"It is so nice for Holly to have a friend,and a sister that she can do things with,and it gives her someone to play with who is her own age,and who likes some of the same things that she does.\" \"I feel so sorry for Sally though I wish that we could do something to help her out a little bit more she's lost her parents,and her grandparents. She's lost her home twice due to a fire.\" \"We are doing what is best for her,and we are giving her a home,and she's got a sister who she can play with,and do things with. There's not much more we can do for her except love her like our own child.\" \"Ok,she seems pretty happy here with us.\" \"She is happy here with us.\" That's good I want her to be happy.\" \"And so do I.\" \"Ok.\" A few minutes later mom,and dad are finished with doing the dishes.

Mom makes sure that the rest of the kitchen is clean,and a few minutes later mom is finished up with cleaning up the kitchen. Mom,and dad exit the kitchen,and they go out into the living room. They sit down on the couch,and they rest for a while. Holly,and I are upstairs in my bedroom playing with our Barbie's,and we are having fun. We dress our barbies,and we comb out their hair. We style their hair as well. We get our barbies ready for a barbie fashion show. After the fashion show we play doctor with our barbies,and our Ken dolls. I talk to Holly for a few minutes while we are playing with our barbies. I exclaim to Holly,\"This is so much fun you,and me playing babies.\" Holly responds back to me,\"Yes,it is sis I'm having fun playing barbies with you.\" \"I am having fun to sis I never have had a sister to do anything with until I met you. I am an only child my parents only had one kid me.\" \"I know how that feels sis I never had anyone to do anything with until we met each other I am an only child to sis.\" \"But now we are sisters,and we can play together anytime that we want to.\" \"Yes,that we can,and we can play games together to.\" \"Yes,that we can.\" \"I'd like to play checkers do you have a checker game sis?\" \"Yes,I've got checkers sis,but we have to put our barbies away sis before we can get the game out.\" \"Ok,sis.\" Holly,and I put our barbie things away,and we make sure that we have the clothes that are for our barbies.

I set the red pieces up on my side of the board. We start the game,and we take our turn playing a piece. I only have one piece left on the board,and so does Holly expect for hers is a king. I make my move,and Holly wins the game. I put the game back away in the box. I put my game back away on my shelf marked games. Holly,and I get up off of the floor,and we sit down on my bed.

I have no control over my bladder,and bowels.\" Holly responds back to me,\"so you just wear a diaper,and go when you need to.\" \"Yea,and when I am done I change my diaper,and wait until I have to go again.\" \"Ok,sis.\" I exit my bedroom,and I walk out into the hallway.

The End ","Summary":" Author's note I don't own the movie Polar Express,or its characters all I own is the ideas for this"},{"Movie":"Longest Yard","Title":"Survival Of The Fittest","Author":"I Know Love Hurts 2010","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8033891","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Survival of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 1: Warm Welcomes \"Remember who's in charge here, inmate Lockhart.\" The dick head in charge spat over me. I was on the floor, gasping for air after receiving a superhuman blow to my stomach. I spat out some blood and took a few deep breaths. \"You may be a female but you're still a worthless piece of shit like everyone else who enters these walls. Don't forget that bitch.\" Captain Knauer said. \"No problem sir.\" I said slowly, trying to breathe again. He doesn't need to remind me that I'm a worthless piece of shit. I'm such a waste of space. The only reason I'm in here is because I nearly killed my sad excuse of a father, the son of a bitch. I had to do it or he would have killed me. I wasn't going to let him kill me. I loved him and he wanted me 6 feet under. What father would want to that to their child? I know he was my stepdad but he loved me for 6 years before Mum died. Then he turned into a completely different person. I wish he was here right now! I'll knock his teeth into his brain! Fucking jackass! Oh just wait till I get out of here in 5 years. If he survives (which I hope he doesn't) I'll finish the job, even if that means I'll end up back in prison for the rest of my pathetic life. It'll be worth it. He kicked my side hard but gently. \"Get up! The warden still needs to see you.\" He ordered. I got up with a struggle with those dumb ass cuffs on my hands and my feet. Where do they think I'm gonna go? \"Really, sir? What have I done to be given the grace of his presence?\" I said cockily, giving him a smirk before I spat on the floor. He laughed then bitch slapped me. I let out a laugh. \"Wow, I've had better slaps off 6 year olds, Captain.\" I laughed. \"Gonna have to do better than that.\" He growled under his breath, making me smirk with achievement. He turned me around roughly and pushed me in front of him. \"Little bitch.\" He mumbled under his breath. \"Hey, I happen to be 6'2. Not little at all.\" I said being my annoying self. Which is what gets me into so much shit, I'm guessing. We got to the door and the woman at the desk tried to talk to me. \"Wow, another lady. How's it going hon?\" She asked. I looked at her and gave a menacing stare. She looked away and continued to type on the ancient computer. \"Get in ass wipe.\" The Captain said, giving me a hard shove. All this pushing was fucking annoying. \"He pushes me again and let's see what happens.\" I thought, and put on a smirk and strode into the wardens office with cocky confidence. \"Ah, Inmate Scarlet Lockhart. You are one tough little bitch, as your file specifies… you're in Allenville for GBH and Attempted Murder?\" I looked to the floor. Well that's a nice way to talk to a lady. You can so tell he doesn't have a wife. Then looked back up. \"Yes Warden.\" I said plainly. \"So what do you think of this beauty.\" He said, patting the walls. \"Pleasure to be graced and trapped within its mighty structure.\" I said plainly. \"Yep, this is one of the best prisons in this part of the state. Also, I wanted to ask you, have you any experience with the game of football.\" \"Which football? I'm from England so do you mean the game where you use your feet or your girly version of rugby?\" I asked, and I found his weak point. Football. American football. \"You better watch your tongue, there. You're in Texas now, and in this glorious state, we take two things very seriously. Prison and football. Now we have a good team, as a matter of fact Captain Knauer is the quarter back. Now we are good, but we could be better. It's been 5 years since our last championship, which is 5 years too long for me to taste the sweet nectar of victory. Now we've been graced with the pleasure of having Paul Crewe, locked up here…\" \"How is that a pleasure? And who's Paul Crewe?\" I asked, I could tell I was getting on the Wardens nerves. \"Captain?\" He asked and turned around. Then Knauer kneed me, hard in my stomach, making me drop to the floor. \"Will you STOP hitting me? I have enough of being hit by ass wipes.\" I said, breathlessly. Knauer went to help me up but I flinched away. \"No! You can go fuck yourself. I can get up on my own.\" I said and slowly got up. \"Paul Crewe is… used to be a very good, very talented Quarterback in the big league. Anyway, he came in earlier today and refused to help out my football team for some reason.\" I shrugged my shoulders. \"Well, sorry but I'm better at free-running and basketball than rugby…\" \"It's football, inmate Lockhart.\" He snapped. \"Like I said Warden, better at free running and basketball than football.\" I lied, I'm actually very familiar with Football, the American version, but I know better than to let him know, but I am good at basketball and free running too. \"What's free-running?\" Knauer asked. I ignored him \"So no, can I go to my cell now?\" I asked, pulling my hands into fists. I rubbed my tongue over my dry teeth and lips before I spat on the ground. \"Yes, Captain Knauer? Take her back to her cell.\" He said pointing to the doors. He nodded and shoved me again. \"You're so lucky I have cuffs on my hands.\" I said, he laughed and gave me another shove before he handed me to another Guard. Before I got out of the door, I stopped and turned round. \"Later warden,\" I said then spat in Knauer's face. I shot him a quick smirk then went out of the door. When Captain was out of ear shot, the guard started to talk to me. \"Nicely done, Inmate Lockhart. Sorry, about him. Knauer's a complete dickhead.\" He was a tall Negro, with soft friendly eyes and a gentle grip. I smiled, he seemed nice compared to the other dicks. \"It's all good, he's soft compared to others I know.\" I said, \"He slaps like a 6 year old too.\" I said making him laugh as we walked. He then turned me and searched through his keys. \"I don't get why you have to wear these cuffs in the prison. It's not like you can escape.\" He said unlocking them. The cuffs on my hands collided with the ground sending a clang echoing down the halls followed by a softer one as he removed the cuffs from my feet. I smiled and rolled my wrists. \"I'm Newman.\" \"Scarlet.\" I said, \"Thanks for getting me out of those things.\" I said, he smiled as we continued to walk. \"Just so you know I'll keep a good eye on you. Just to make sure nothing happens to you. Your cell is next to the two most unthreatening guys we have here. Your cell has been renovated to suit your needs and to shield you from curious eyes. Most of the inmates haven't seen a female like your-self in years so they may go a little crazy.\" \"Well thanks for the 41-o on everything and i appreciate you looking out for me, Man.\" I said sharing a hand shake with him. \"No problem, baby. Lunch will be ready soon, so you just go down the stairs and follow the arrows that say mess hall. See you around.\" \"Alright, later Newman.\" I said as I entered my cell. He wasn't kidding about it being renovated this place was sweet. Well it had a closed off toilet in the front, a single bed to the left of the cell along with a hidden bedside table right at the back (which was hidden by the bed), on the back wall was a small window that had a clear view of a football field. On the right it had a small sink, a set of small draws and a lamp. Better than many of the rooms I have had to cope with. I pulled open some draws and found about 4 changes of clothes along with a cool baseball cap and a tonne of hairbands. I smiled and got changed; which was when I took proper notice of what I was wearing, which was a pure white one piece suit. It was horrible! So I got changed into some plain jean shorts and a white baggy t-shirt, and then put my trainers back on. I looked in the mirror and smiled at my reflection. I had pale white skin, long glossy light brown hair that ended at my waist, big green eyes and a fringe that covered my left eye. I winked and then I tied my hair back leaving my fringe over my left eye and put my baseball cap on.[Chapter 2] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 2: Making Friends Already! Suddenly, a bell went off and a voice over the speakers started to speak making me jump. \"Lunch time!\" I shrugged my shoulders and went to the mess hall. As I walked I had every eye on me. I fucking hated being the centre of attention in any format. It's the worst thing ever, but what do expect? With me being the only female in the entire prison that is of descent hotness. I mean my only other comp is that secretary woman and she looked horrific. If someone threw Hydrochloric acid over her face it might make a huge improvement. I laughed in my head at my own little joke. I kept my head down and my cap down. As I pushed my tray across and creamy sloppy substance was thrown onto my tray. \"Hello, cutie pie. What does an old timer like me have to do to get to where he would like to be with a fine woman such as your-self?\" An old guy with a horrific goatee asked, with a sicking, flirtatious style smirk. I beckoned him over and punched him in the face. I heard a few in mate cry 'Oh!' He uncovered his face and I gave him a broken nose that was bleeding. \"How about this? You hit on me again and I'll do more than punch you in the face. You understand, dipshit?\" I asked, he nodded furiously and put the slop on my tray. \"Thank you.\" I said, grabbed my tray and walked away. I was looking around for some place to sit. As I walked, I felt everyone's eyes in the room were on me. I could feel my heart pound, wishing I was in a female prison; if only they weren't so overcrowded. I found about 6 empty chairs around another African American but this guy was an inmate and was wearing a dark blue, denim jacket and jeans with a light blue shirt underneath with a dark blue denim cap matching his jacket with a fag on his ear, talking to a white guy wearing a blue denim shirt with a white t-shirt and navy tracks and a navy blue hat. I walked over to them around the back of the white guy. \"… about the love of a beautiful woman?\" He asked, guessing he was new too. \"Well you'll have to lower your standards on the beautiful part and on the woman part.\" He said pointing over to some wanna be transvestites. I rolled my eyes. \"I'll just stick with the cheeseburgers.\" He said as he grabbed at a slice of bread. \"Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months, he's gonna look like Beyoncé.\" I shook my head. \"Any plastic surgeon who could turn that into Beyoncé is a fucking miracle worker.\" I though. \"No thanks,\" The white guy said, shallowly. I know how he feels. I thought that now would be a good a time as any to sit down next to him but sat as far away as I possibly could without falling off the bench. Just keeping my head down as I eat the food that was actually pretty good to be honest. \"Yo, yo,yo! I stand corrected.\" The African American said. \"A pretty lady behind the walls of all male prison?\" I looked up and gave him a look as I chewed the food in my mouth. \"Congratulation's, Captain obvious. Want a medal?\" I asked him. Making the guy next to me laugh, I looked at him as he shook his head, shovelling the food into his mouth. \"Whoa, chill. Sorry. Never see a girl convict behind the walls of this place before. This is new.\" He said holding his hands up in defence. \"Really?\" I asked taking fake interest. \"I never would have noticed with the great, heart-warming welcoming Captain Knauer gave me earlier.\" I said sarcastically. They guy next to me shook his head with a pained expression on it. Then I noticed his black eye. \"Guessing you got the same.\" He nodded. \"Caretaker. And this is Paul Crewe.\" Caretaker said pointing out himself then Crewe then held his hand out to me. I nervously reached my hand over and gave it a shake and shone a warm and real smile. Very rare thing since I was convicted last month. \"Scarlet Lockhart, Why do they call you Caretaker?\" \"Because, it's my name and I can get anything you could ever want. Whatever your pleasure I can ferisilitate. Weed, meth, Prozac, Steds…\" \"He can get McDonalds too.\" The guy next to me said, pointing at Caretaker with his spoon. \"Nice…\" I said, crossing my arms and leaning on the desk. \"Oh, and by the way you two. One more thing, now this is important. Don't let these guys scare you, don't let them punk you. Cause, if you do that, you're gonna end up being someone bitch.\" I nodded. \"Don't want that. Thanks for the advice, Caretaker. Nice meeting you Scarlet.\" He said patting me on the back, then walked off over to a guy group of guys. \"What's he doing?\" I asked, Caretaker just shrugged his shoulders. He picked up a guy's tray and they spoke for a few seconds. Then suddenly he smashed the tray over the guy's head then all hell broke loose. I was standing there totally shocked at his sudden rage, then I realized he was just doing what Caretaker said, not letting himself get punked. I smiled as I realized, although he was getting his ass kicked, he was a pretty good fighter. Suddenly a large pair of hands turned me around and I was punched in the face. Hard. I fell onto my back and held my cheek. \"Know your place here, bitch.\" He said, three guys were standing over me laughing. I smirked back. \"I already know my place.\" Now it's my turn to not get punked. I bet these guys have never lost to a girl in their lives. Well that is gonna change. I jumped up and kicked the leader in his nuts, making him drop to his knees, I then grabbed his head and kneed him in the head knocking him out cold. Then another guy advanced and tried to swing for my face. I did the spits and grabbed his nuts, twisted them and then jumped up, giving him a hard upper cut to the face. He flew back and was out cold. I turned around and pulled my fists up to my face. \"Still wanna piece of me? Huh? Didn't your Mum ever tell you it's rude to hit a lady?\" I asked sarcastically, he was about to charge when Caretakers voice rung over all the chaos. \"HORNETS NEST!\" He yelled. \"Hornets, what?\" I asked, I was pushed to the ground by a small but well-built black guy. \"Take cover. Those pellets are worst then bullets.\" He said into my ear. I pulled my knees up to my chest on my side and tucked my arms around my head; while small little plastic pellet balls bounced and recashayed off the walls, tables and floor. After a while it was horrifically quiet. I un-curled myself and looked at the guy laid down on the floor next to me. Then he saw my face. \"You're a girl?\" He said. \"Yeah, I'm Scarlet.\" \"Earl Megget.\" He said. I smiled. And we shook hands. \"EVERYONE STAY DOWN!\" One guard said. I never thought I say it but their voices were a Gods send. \"STAY QUIET!\" Another one said. \"Come on Crewe get up. Get up superstar.\" Knauer said. I crawled over to Caretaker to get a better look. Crewe stood up and dusted himself off. I looked to Knauer and my blood boiled. I fucking hate that guy, I pushed my cap up a bit and watched. \"Yes, sir?\" He asked casually. \"You think you can do anything you want around here, don't you? Well, you are no different than any other piece of shit that calls this place home.\" He said as matter of factly. I was about ready to punch Knauer in the face. He's such a dick head! \"Asshole.\" I whispered, earning few sniggers from around me. I held my hand up to a guy next to me and he high fived it. \"Really?\" Crewe asked. \"These guys think you're a dumb redneck too?\" He said, making everyone in the mess hall laugh, including me. But this is awesome, another guy who likes to piss the guards off. I could see the fire of anger burn in Knauer's eyes, even from meters away. He turned away looking like he was laughing too but I know from past experience that this guy doesn't like jokes. He grabbed his baton and went to hit Crewe across the face. But Crewe caught it! Caretaker looked at him like he was crazy. \"No one ever done that before?\" I whispered. \"Nope, just him. That's gonna be a week in the hot box.\" He whispered back. \"What's the hot box?\" I asked. \"I'll tell you later.\" He said more interested in the scene unfolding. \"By the way,\" He handed me on of the small plastic pellets. \"Ritual, everyone keeps one from their first hornet's nest bomb.\" \"Thanks.\" I said and put it in my pocket. \"You better cut that shit out, it's getting old.\" Crewe said, I smirked at that answer, because I would have said the same thing to that ass but I would have made him infertile moments later. \"That's gonna cost you.\" He said in a threatening tone making me wanna knock his lights outs again. \"Looking forward to it.\" He said smugly, they started to walk away when another tall, well built guy pulled his arm back and swung at Crewe, a pure KO punch sent Crewe packing and he fell to the floor out cold. The guy that KO'ed him and another dude both picked him up by his arms and dragged his motionless body out of the Mess room. After a few minutes everyone left, except me and Caretaker who just sat there talking. \"I hope Crewe's alright. Damn that was one hell of a punch,\" Caretaker said, I nodded. \"So what's the hotbox?\" I asked. \"Man, basically it like entering hell on earth. It is a small outhouse made all out of steel, the inside is so hot, you pass out within minutes of being in there. You get different amount of time for disobeying the rules although, it is only used as an extremity.\" I nodded listening intently. \"I'm guessing you've been in there?\" \"Nope, I learn what I know from other inmates here. I'm cool with everyone because I can get them anything from the outside world in.\" Suddenly I heard groans. \"Who's that?\" He asked me, I smirked. \"Just two guys I KO'ed, during the brawl.\" I said smirking with pride. I stood up and walked over to them. They got up and when they saw me, fear was written across their faces. \"Wanna try anything again, dicks?\" I asked them coolly. They shook their heads. Then ran out of there, I laughed. \"So what's your hobbies, Scar?\" \"Nothing much really, I like reading, I like drawing and writing… Uh, I'm a good free runner, I'm a good basketball player and I'm a pretty good running back.\" I said, he nodded. \"Not bad for a female.\" He said, \"I'm also, a pretty good spy. I am as silent as a mouse and I'm a black belt in every form of martial arts.\" \"Remind me not to piss you off.\" He said, making me laugh. \"No worries there, you're awesome.\" I said. \"Are you from America?\" He asked. I shook my head. \"England. Why?\" \"Just wondering.\" He said.[Chapter 3] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 3: The Favour Crewe A Week later I was watching over the guards training from the window of my cell. Caretaker though he fuel my spying nature as well as my creative side, so he got me some binoculars and about 12 writing pads. When I saw a familiar face, well four actually. I saw Knauer, he was the quarter back. Pretty good one too. He had a good throw and was quick. Very quick. Newman was a blocker, but then again, I could have guessed his position if he told me he played football. Then I saw Warden Hazen and Crewe. When I saw Crewe a smiled spread across my face. \"He survived a week? Wow.\" I thought, writing down what I saw. I zoomed in and lip read what they were saying. Another thing I'm good at, lip reading. \" And apparently steroids?\" Crewe said making me giggle. \"Look, seems like you got all the talent you'd want, So why do you need me?\" \" Well, now, you might find this hard to believe but there are some folks here in the prison ledge that don't care for me very much.\" \" You warden?\" Crewe said sarcastically. I shook my head. \" Yeah, well, they thought it might be amusing to schedule the defending league chaps as our first game. And me? Well, I thought an old pro like your-self might have some, training camp tricks, drills, insights to offer up. That might help us get that competitive edge?\" \" All right. Relatively simple, you need a tune-up game.\" \" A tune-up game?\" The warden asked. \" Yeah, in college, we'd start every season against Appalachian State or some slack division 2 team. Kick the living shit out of them, Get their confidence up.\" Now he has a point there, confidence is the best tool anyone can have, I should know. I spent 9 years of my life to myself because I was so shy. \" You know something, Paul? You've just given me and inspiration.\" \" Great, what?\" He asked plainly. \" You're gonna assemble a team to play the first game against us. And you, Mr. Crewe, are gonna be the quarterback.\" Although I hate to admit it, that wiped the smile off Crewe's face. \"What you up too, Scar?\" Caretaker asked. \"Sush! I need to concentrate.\" I told him. \"… Don't think so.\" He said, \" Let me tell you something, In my prison, to get along, you gotta go along.\" \" I just wanna do my three years and be done.\" He said, I nodded. \"Good for you.\" I said smiling. \"What?\" \"Crewe's out of the hot box and talking to the warden.\" I said. \"… before you assaulted Captain Knauer. Now you could be with us for a very long time, Mr. Crewe.\" \" Don't Crewe, don't give in. Stand firm.\" I thought. Crewe hesitated. \" Fine, I'll do it.\" Crewe said defeated. I shook my head. \" Good Choice.\" The warden said, before he walked off. I put my binoculars in their holder pack on my shorts. Then I turned to Caretaker. \"Anyone noticed the warden looks a lot like the farmer on Babe?\" I asked, Caretaker laughed. \"Never realized before.\" He said. \"What I came in here for was that I got you something.\" He said, handing me a box. \"Why do you keep getting my stuff, Caretaker.\" I asked him with a smile. \"I dunno, I guess I just wanna make up for you being the only female in this joint.\" He said sincerely. I smiled and gave him a high five. \"Thanks, Dog.\" I said, and opened it up. He smiled and lay down on my bed. \"Oh, no way! 3 Cheers for sweet revenge, Black Parade and danger days! Thanks Caretaker!\" I said jumping to my CD player, also given to me by Caretaker. I opened it up and clicked play. Seconds later My Chemical Romance was blasting out of the speakers. I turned down the music so it was just in the background. \"So Crewe? He's alright.\" He asked throwing a small ball into the air and catching it. \"Very much so.\" I said grabbing the ball and made it spin on my finger, before I gave it back to him. \"Shame.\" Caretaker joked. \"Wow, but you have to admit he's one tough little bastered.\" I nodded in agreement. \"So what's up with the guy/girls?\" I asked caretaker. \"They are just like that. Why don't you go hang with them?\" \"I don't mean to sound like a dick head but they just ain't my people. You know.\" \"Yeah, I get cha, babe.\" He said winking. \"Thanks Dog.\" I said giving him a handshake. \"I dunno, they just too forceful.\" I said; Caretaker nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, I don't blame you either; I wouldn't be caught near them. They look like female Michael Jackson's at different stages of his life.\" He said making me laugh. I looked over to the entrance and Crewe entered my cell. \"Hey Caretaker; Hey Scarlet.\" \"Wow, you survived the hot box.\" I acted. He nodded. \"Can you guys help me out?\" \"Sure.\" Me and caretaker said at the same time. He turned the music up so it just covered our voices. \"Warden wants me to assemble a team to play a tune up game with the guards.\" \"Let me guess, you as quarterback?\" I said. \"How did you know?\" Crewe asked with a smile. \"Lucky guess.\" I said, winking at Caretaker. \"So will you give me a hand?\" He asked again. \"I'm in,\" I said holding my hand in the middle of the three of us. Crewe put his hand in. \"Alright, I'm in,\" Caretaker said, and put his hand in. \"Thanks guys.\" He said, \"I'll work on the flyer.\" Caretaker said. \"What's a flyer?\" I asked, they gave me a look. \"Hey don't look at me like that; I got transferred over here from England!\" I snapped. They held their hands up. \"Sorry, flyer is like a poster.\" I nodded, getting the change in vocab now. \"Thanks.\" I said, \"Alright, check you later Babe.\" \"Later Dog; Later Crewe.\" I said then laid on my bed, writing in my notepad.[Chapter 4] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 4: First Pep Talk In the court yard – The next day I was sitting on the bleachers drawing the court yard, while hiding away from the prison. Suddenly the bleachers was lifted upward on the right side, causing me to slide to the left side, fall off the 4th bench up on them and landed roughly on the ground on my stomach. The guy put the bleachers down and ran to me. I sat up and my arm hurt, I hadn't broken it just sour. \"I'm sorry, misses. I didn't see you on there.\" He said acting like a big child. I smiled. Oh I couldn't be mad at that. I rolled onto my ass and smiled up to him. \"Don't worry about it, no harm done. So what are you doing here?\" I asked him standing up and dusting myself off. I was wearing a pair of light blue jeans and a white tank top and a denim button up shirt, which I left unbuttoned. \"I'm wanna try out for football.\" He said sweetly. I laughed at the big friendly giant. \"Sure, but the try out ain't for another hour.\" I said to him. His smile dropped and mine did too. \"Oh, I sorry. I didn't know.\" He said sounding like he was going to cry. \"No, no, no! Don't cry. Simple mistake.\" I said flashing my sweet smiled. He looked up and sniffed. \"I'm Scarlet, what's your name big guy?\" \"I'm called Swatowski.\" He said cheerfully. \"Nice to meet you Swatowski. Wanna play catch for a bit?\" I said grabbing the football from under the bleachers. He started laughing cheerfully and clapped his hands clumsily. What happened after that was me and Swatowski were playing a game that I used to play to improve my throwing distance. What you have to do is start close together and each time you catch the ball you take a step back. I ended up half way down the yard and was about to throw back. I closed my eyes and imaged my first full pitch throw. I smiled and opened my eyes, and then I threw the ball. Soon after the ball came flying back to the far left. When I saw it, I took off, running towards the shadow. I looked at it and jumped grabbing it mid-air and pulled it close to my chest. I thought that would be enough catch, for now so I sprinted back. \"Nice throw Swatowski.\" I said, holding my hand for a high five. \"No, I didn't throw it, Mister there 'throw-ed' it.\" He said pointing to Paul. I shook my head and smiled. I threw the ball at him and he caught it. \"Nice catch Lockhart.\" He said high fiving me. I smiled. \"Thanks Crewe.\" I said, smiling. Then a small handful of prisoners showed up and Swatowski started using the bleacher as a dung bell just like he had done when I was sitting on their alone. I saw Caretaker walk over with a clip board and walked over to me. \"Hey Baby.\" He said opening his arms for a hug. I just held my hand out and looked away. He shook my hand though. \"Hey Dog.\" I said. \"Hey, what's up? Don't you like hugs?\" He asked. \"Not perticually. Don't take it personally, it's just something that developed. Sorry.\" I said. \"It's alright, I understand.\" \"This is bullshit! Crappy field, shit ass equipment. How the fuck are we gonna work with this?\" Crewe asked. \"Hey man, at least we got some world class players over there.\" Caretaker said. I turned and looked over them all, including Swatowski who was still pushing the bleachers up and down. \"46, 47, 48, 49, 50!\" The guys on the bleachers chanted. I laughed and shook my head. \"He might make the team.\" Caretaker said, hopefully. \"No shit,\" I said, squinting my eyes against the burning bright sun. I pulled out my cap from my back pocket and put it on. \"Well if we got to cut him you're doing it.\" Crewe said, I laughed and patted caretaker on the back. \"Come on, Dog.\" I said. \"Scarlet, what happened to your arm?\" Caretaker asked. I gave him a look and looked at my arm, which had a long single trail of blood from a cut just above my elbow. \"Oh nothing, just fell when me and Swatowski where playing catch.\" I said flashing a smile. \"I'm fine, dog.\" I said, he gave me a quizzing look. I sighed. \"Fine, don't believe me then. But I am okay.\" I said, giving him a smirk. I then ran to catch up to Crewe who was talking to Swatowski. \"Well, well, well. You a football player?\" Crewe asked. \"Oh no, I ain't played no football, mister.\" Swatowski said shyly. I smiled. \"Hey Swatowski.\" I said, \"Hey, Scarlet.\" He said happily. \"So what happened? You read the flyer? Though it might be some fun?\" \"Oh, I can't read.\" He said, looking to the floor shyly still with a smile across his face. I smiled and shook my head and looked at Crewe. \"Oh, don't worry,\" Caretaker said. \"Reading's for rich people.\" Swatowski laughed. \"Just so you know, we're putting together a football team. Love for you to join.\" Swatowski smiled and leaned forward till he had a 90 degree angle. \"Will you teach me to football?\" He asked. We all nodded. \"Sure we'll teach you to football, won't we guys?\" Crewe asked. \"Hack, I'll teach you anything. Just don't eat me.\" He said patting him on the shoulder. Swatowski let out a huge echoing laugh of joy and propelled Caretaker in the air. \"Down, Shrek. Down.\" Caretaker said. I laughed and clapped. \"Yep, it's no problem, you know I could also teach you how to read, if you want.\" I said, smiling. \"Really?\" He asked happily. I nodded, giving him a sweet smile. \"Yeah sure.\" I said and he jumped happily. And pulled me into a hug, propelling me in the air. I started to panic. \"Swatowski, put me down!\" I begged. He put me down quickly and I began breathing quickly like I was out of breath. \"Sorry! Sorry!\" Swatowski panicked. Worrying about me. \"Scar, you okay?\" Crewe asked. I just kept breathing deeply. \"Yeah, yeah. I just panicked.\" I said, \"Sorry, Swatowski… Didn't mean to scare you.\" I said. \"It okay.\" I smiled and patted his back. \"Okay! Bring it in!\" Paul said, throwing the ball in the air and catching it with one hand. \"Everyone who's trying out for the team. Wake up.\" He said. \"Can you give a brother a little hustle?\" Caretaker asked. I laughing silently and shook my head. I went to join the others on the bleacher, seeing if I could be a running back. I sat next to Swatowski and rested my arms on the bench above me as I leaned back. \"Very good. For those of you who don't know who I am, I'm Paul Crewe. I'm gonna be your Couch, your Captain, your quarterback.\" \"Hey you haven't played in years, why can't I be quarterback? Huh?\" A small midget dude asked. I laughed, just by looking at him, you could tell he couldn't be a quarterback. \"Yeah, your right. Let see what you got.\" Crewe said throwing him the ball. \"Hit me, I'm open.\" He said holding his hands up and ready. \"Hake, hake, hake!\" He yelled before he threw it back, which set it way over its mark. \"That's why, now sit down and shut up.\" Crewe said and that got a laugh out of everyone. \"It slipped, I just ate popcorn.\" He said, I shook my head at his pathetic excuse and changed my position, supporting my upper body on my arms that where leaning on my knees. \"Question? Any of you gentlemen…\" \"Or woman.\" I butted in earning a laugh from everyone except Crewe, Caretaker and Swatowski. \"Come on boys, settle down. She's actually a pretty good catcher.\" Crewe said stopping their laughter. \"So has anyone here played football before?\" I put my hand up along with a fat guy at the front. \"Where?\" He asked me. \"England, I used to play for the Coventry Invaders (A/N: Not a real Rugby/Football team Btw). I was a pretty good running back.\" I said. \"Okay, what about you?\" He asked the fat guy in front of me. \"Kansas State.\" He said plainly with his mouth full of McDonald burger. Whoa! Caretaker wasn't shitting me! \"Are you shitting me? For couch Schneider?\" Crewe asked in disbelief. \"Nah, Kansas State prison.\" He said, I shook my head. \"Now I heard they have the softest matrasses out there.\" Swatowski said. I laughing under my breath. But surprisingly it started a whole conversation. \"Yeah, they do! Yeah they do!\" He said over everyone. \"Not as soft as the ones in West Texas mental institution.\" The midget from before said. \"Really?\" Swatowski said, sounding as if his spirit had been broken. I smiled and gave him a pat on the back. I think I'm gonna like this big guy. \"Alright, Let's finish this convocation later. For now, I wanna see what you got out there.\" Crewe and Caretaker walked off. I got up and leap frogged over 3 people before I landed gracefully on the ground and waited for Swatowski. Then I was turned around by the guy who tried hitting on me on my first day. \"Hey baby, I have a feeling we got off on the wrong foot.\" Then Swatowski came up behind me and gave the guy a mean look. I smiled at Swatowski. \"Don't worry Swatowski, I can deal with him.\" I said. \"Yeah your right, Scarlet.\" I said holding my hand out, trying to be nice. He shook it and then suddenly pulled me forward into a kiss. I panicked and pulled away quickly, grabbed his arm flipped him over and stamped on his chest. I quickly walked away, taking deep breaths. God, that can't happen again. \"Scar, you okay?\" Caretaker asked, I nodded. \"Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.\" I said, taking in deep breaths. Man that scared me. Gotta stay clear of that old twat.[Chapter 5] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 5: Rugby… Football Try Outs The first training practise we did was running. I smiled and we all lined up on the line. \"Ready, go!\" Crewe yelled then Caretaker blew his whistle. I took off in a shot. Pushing past most of the other guys, and skidded in between one guys legs and came first. I smiled and took off my helmet, waiting for the others to finish. Then I saw the fat guy drop to the ground. Shook my head and next was the tire rings. We had to step inside of them without touching the rubber edging. Not my best, I hit a lot of rubber. When I was finished it was the Midgets turn from before. He did 3 of the 12 tires and fell, then he went mental, slamming his fists down onto it. \"Stupid tire! You freaking tire! You think our better than me?\" He yelled before he through the tire a short distance. \"I'll kick your ass!\" He announce before making a boxing stance and making small jabs at the air. \"3.\" Crewe said then he turned to him. \"And a half?\" He asked. The little midget nodded and pointed at him before he went back to the team. \"Yeah that's better.\" He said as he went back. I slapped my face and rubbed away the sweat that was building up on my forehead. We did a few more exercises before we got to our last one. Where we had to tackle a giant sand bag about the size of a boxing punching bag, that was suspended on a giant wooden swing frame. A few people went before me and then i was next. I didn't want to be a tackler but I tried my best. I ran at it full blast and I actually did pretty well. I make it swing a bit higher than others. I smiled and walked back to the others over hearing Crewe and Caretaker talking. \"7, I think. That was pretty good.\" \"Yeah.\" They said, and smiled. Next was Swatowski. I smiled. \"Come on Swatowski! You can do it!\" I cheered. He crouched down and held his hand up in the air. Caretaker blew the whistle. \"Daddy!\" He cried before he smashed into the sand back, making it fly off the hinge and broke one of its supports as he ran into it, hugging the sandbag before tripping over onto it. I jumped back in surprise. \"I think that's a ten.\" Caretaker said. Crewe nodded. \"Alright go with a ten.\" Swatowski walked up to them, hugging the sand bag. \"I'm sorry, I broke-ed your toy.\" He said sadly. I ran up to him and patted him on the back. \"No, that's a good thing.\" Crewe said. \"Yeah, not many people can do that Swatowski.\" I said. \"Yeah, why don't you have a victory hug with Caretaker.\" Caretaker looked at Crewe. \"What?\" he asked. Swatowski laughed happily, \" \"Okay!\" He cheered before picking him up and hugging him. \"Asshole!\" Caretaker said, making me and Crewe laugh. After a while we started an actual game. I got in my position and everyone got in theirs. \"Okay, everyone. Half speed on this one. Slow and easy.\" Crewe said I nodded which took off a little of the pressure. \"Ready! Go!\" And chaos erupted and about 6 people off the other team advanced towards me. I saw that most of the team where fighting and then I realized that they wanted to get rid of the 'weakest'. I got to my fighting stance and one of the threw a punch. I knew we needed these guys so I tried my best to avoid having to attack them, but they were making it increasingly difficult. \"Stop it!\" Caretaker screamed as the others continued to fight. \"Stop the violence! Can't we all get along?\" I ran over to him and whispered in his ear. \"You do realize we are in a prison with hard ass criminal's right?\" I asked him. He gave me a look. \"Oh right.\" He then left them too it till it calmed down.[Chapter 6] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 6: Introducing Nate Scarborough! After 2 more hours we called it a day. We all waked back and the dick that kept hitting on me ran up to Crewe. They talked for a minute or two then Crewe continued to walk. \"Good work today guys, starting to look really sharp out there.\" As the team walked away, Me and Caretaker sat down on the steps as the rest. When the rest of the team were out of ear shot… \"We're gonna suck.\" Caretaker said. I looked down. \"Yeah, no dought about it.\" Crewe said. I crossed my arms and rested my chin on them. \"Sorry, guys.\" I said. I took off my cap. \"No, you're really good.\" Caretaker said. I smiled and untied my hair, letting my long brown hair flow down my body to my waist. \"Wow, you have really long hair.\" Crewe said. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'm growing it out.\" I said, scratching at my hair making it seem to have more volume. Crewe laughed then looked out into the distance and there was the silhouette of a man walking towards us. When he was in front of us, He stopped. \"You look like you could use a little help.\" He said, he looked like he was in his late 40's early 50's. I smiled. \"No offense, my man, but you're a little… seasoned.\" I looked at Crewe in surprise. \"Seasoned? I'm not asking to play, I'll coach. I'm Nate Scarborough.\" My mouth dropped. This guy was a freaking legend! \"Nate Scarborough? The Heisman Trophy winner from Oklahoma?\" Crewe asked. \"The inmate from cellblock D. But about a hundred years ago, when I could run and gun? Yeah, I was a Sooner then.\" He nodded sadly. I smiled, poor guy. A football legend and he's locked away, In this place away from his dream. Away from his love, and Crewe is exactly the same. \"Nate? You were a legend! How did you end up behind bars?\" I asked. He turned to face me. \"Obstructing justice.\" He said plainly. \"Got 20 years. I get parole in 3.\" \"Sweet.\" Caretaker said. I nodded. \"Still, nice to meet you man. Huge fan.\" I said holding out my hand. He smiled and shook it. \"I heard you were dead?\" Caretaker said, we all looked at him. \"No, I ain't dead. I've been right here, rotting.\" Nate said, looking out into the distance. \"Waiting for a chance to get back at those sadistic guards. Waiting. For this.\" I nodded. \"Yeah, most of them are dicks.\" Caretaker said. \"Especially Knauer.\" Crewe said, I nodded. \"Newman's nice though.\" I said. \"Which one's Newman?\" I grabbed my notepad from behind me, and turned to find the page where I drew him down. \"Wow, you drew this?\" Crewe asked. I nodded and hid my face. I looked back up and smiled. Then he gave it me back. \"Yeah, I've seen this guy around. He joined last year. He's a cool brother.\" Caretaker said. I smiled. \"True that. He got me an IPod.\" \"Well, anyways, coach, as you can see, we don't exactly have the cream of the crop to work with here.\" Caretaker said, putting the conversation. \"Well, what are we gonna do? How are we gonna find players?\" He asked, I nodded. \"How'd they get you to go to Florida State?\" Nate asked. \"They recruited me?\" He said plainly, then a look of realization flashed across his face. \"I'll get the strippers.\" Caretaker said, standing up and he walked off. I smiled. \"Alright, check you guys later.\" I said grabbing my notepad and walking back into the building. I walked round the corner, and was thrown to the floor, hard then kicked in the stomach. \"Don't think I forgot about you spitting in my face the other day, inmate Lockhart.\" Knauer hissed above me. I tried to get up but he kicked me back down. \"What's wrong Knauer? Acting all big and touch by bullying a little girl?\" I asked, receiving another blow to my stomach. \"Your scum, Inmate Lockhart… your sex is a fucking disgrace.\" He said kicking me again. \"Thanks for clearing that up, bastered.\" I said, getting up. Knauer then smiled at me sickly sweet. \"One more, and I'll put you in the hot box.\" I pretended to freeze with fear. \"What? The hot box?\" I said with sarcastic fear. \"Oh how will I ever survive in a small space with little water? Oh the madness!\" I cried dropping to my knees. \"Why cruel world why! This is worst then paying for the carrier bag!\" I cried, pretending to wollow at his feet. \"Just fuck off with the rest of the shit bags. And I will finish what I started.\" He said then walked away. Once he was around the corner. I slid down the wall and held my stomach, taking deep breaths before I went back to my cell.[Chapter 7] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 7: Meeting Skitchy The next day – On the Court Yard I was stretching getting ready to practise my sprinting. I was watching Crewe, he always makes me happy. I don't know why but he makes me smile. I got into position. \"Ready Swatowski!\" I said and then threw the ball to me. It was a little high so I jumped for it and pulled it close to my chest. Then I ran. I started at the end zone and I needed to get to the other end zone while dodging the oncoming tackles. Overall there were 4 guys going to tackle me. 2 single tacklers and 1 double. I was coming up to the first. He charged and jumped for me. I skidded underneath him, did a forward roll then got to my feet and ran. The next tackle was coming up, I skidded to a stop and did a back flip. They smashed into each other and I jumped over them as they hit the floor. The last guy just went for me. I skidded to a stop and spun past him before I ran towards the opposite end zone. \"Yeah. Nice boot, skin man.\" He said to our new kicker. \"Hey Crewe, why does he get to be the kicker? I was All-State, man.\" The midget, Brucie said. When I got to the other end zone, I threw the ball back to Swatowski. \"Let's see what you got.\" Crewe said as I punched the sky with my fists. I'm getting faster. Suddenly a football smacked me right in my stomach, knocking the wind out of me and I fell to the ground. \"Holy shit! That's why, you dumb-ass. Just go do some laps.\" He said running over to me he took off my helmet and held out his hand. I grabbed it and he pulled me up to a sitting position. \"Scar? You okay?\" Crewe asked rubbing my back. I sat up straight and took in deep breaths. \"I'm fine.\" I said, holding my stomach. \"Shit that hurt.\" I said, pulling my baseball cap out from the back of my shorts and put it on. \"That's good. Come on.\" He said, I nodded and he helped me to my feet. \"I heard you boys needed to see me?\" He asked, walking over to Nate and another old guy. \"Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy.\" Nate said. I smiled. \"Hey Skitchy, Scarlet.\" I said holding my hand out. \"Hey Dog. Only lady in this place. Nice to meet you.\" He said shaking my hand. \"Anyway, you guys check that building over there?\" He said pointing behind him. We nodded. \"They keep all the records in the basement.\" He said. I smiled and pushed my cap up. \"He's been here so long, he knows where everything is.\" Nate said, I nodded. \"That ain't necessarily a good thing, is it?\" Crewe asked. \"I had a parole date in '86. But I got in a tussle with a guard and...\" I nodded and patted his shoulder. \"One punch and it went away.\" Nate said, I shook my head. \"Twenty extra years for one punch?\" Crewe asked. \"Yeah, that seems pretty unfair just for punching a guard?\" I said. He nodded \"Well,\" Caretaker said. I turned to face him. \"Unfortunately for him, the guard he punched just happens to be the warden now.\" I shook my head. Crewe smiled. \"Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?\" Crewe asked with a smile. \"'Oh, shit' is right.\" I smiled. Suddenly a fight broke out behind us. I turned around and two of the guards on duty ran past me. \"Fight in the yard. Send backup.\" One of them said into the walkie talkie. \"Right on time.\" Skitchy said. \"That was planned?\" I asked. \"Hey, we need a distraction if we're gonna get in there, babe.\" Caretaker said back handing my shoulder gently. \"I got you dog.\" I said, pull my cap down. \"Let's do it.\" Nate said, I nodded. \"Let's do it.\" Crewe said. \"Yeah, I'm down with the groove.\" I said and I followed after them.[Chapter 8] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 8: Half A Star? In the basement \"Ain't you guys glad you got a black man for a friend?\" Caretaker said, holding up his afro comb/skeleton key. \"Hell yeah.\" Crewe said, I pulled out my mini flash light and shone my light around. \"Come on.\" Caretaker said to me. I nodded and followed after them. Nate was at the computer and mashing down on the key furiously. I laughed in my head, remembering the times when I used to spend hours upon hours hidden away in my bedroom, writing endless pages of stories, entering worlds that I could create at the touch of a button, letting my unwanted imagination that the world outside the four wall of my room couldn't possible understand. Writing was… is, and always will be an escape from the real world. I can't imagine a world where I couldn't write, to just be free from reality and escape, really. \"Hazen has a rating system for every con.\" He said plainly as I typed. I looked and each page had a picture of the convict, their first and last name, description and a star rating underneath. \"So is this place just full of inmate records?\" I asked. \"Guards too. Full history on everyone.\" Skitchy said. He was keeping an eye out. I smiled. Knauer is gonna get his comeuppance soon enough. But I'll keep the records in mind for now. He hasn't really done anything that bad to me yet. \"Cool, I'll keep that in mind.\" I said, I put my flashlight away and joined the others who were crowded around the computer. \"What's three stars?\" Crewe asked. \"The more prone to violence that the inmate is, the more stars he gets.\" Nate said with a smile. \"Five stars is the max.\" Skitchy said. \"I didn't know that.\" Caretaker said with a smile. \"Let's see how many stars my maniacal ass got.\" When his page came up a snuffled a laugh. \"Wow.\" Crewe said. \"Half a star? That's gotta be a mistake.\" He said in disbelief. \"Check it again. Check it again.\" \"You're about as maniacal as a boxful of kittens.\" Crewe said making me laugh again. \"Come on, that's not funny, man.\" Caretaker said with fear in his eyes. \"I'm gonna have to stab somebody or something. Get my rep up.\" The way he said it, it was like a matter of life and death. I smiled and patted him on the back. \"Why don't we have a maniacal pillow fight tonight. That could get it up some.\" Crewe said trying not to laugh, as was I. \"Yeah. We can sell it to pay-per-view. Superstar Versus Half-a-Star.\" Skitchy said, that got me. I covered my mouth as hard as I could and laughed. Trying not to make a sound higher than a whisper. \"Why don't you shut up before I slit your throat and watch the dust come out.\" Caretaker said, trying to act all menacing. Yet failing miserably. \"You too Lockhart!\" \"Or what? Are you gonna kill me with your kindness?\" I said sarcastically. \"Oh I'm so scared.\" \"Come on, guys, we only got a couple minutes.\" Nate said, typing again. \"How about this guy?\" He asked. \"Damn, this fool got the chair three times, ain't died yet.\" Caretaker stated. \"Well, we may not have the most talented team, but we will definitely have the meanest.\" \"Right on that, baby.\" I said giving him a high five. Then a whistle came from down the hall way. I went into stealth mode and crawled to where Skitchy was. \"Go to the others.\" I said. He nodded and crawled back to the others. Then Eagleheart came round the corner, he looked inside the room and then continued walking. I quietly jumped out of the room and chopped the back of his neck with my hand, knocking him out cold. I smiled and popped my head through to the guys. \"Come on guys, he's out.\" I said and we went for the exit.[Chapter 9] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 9 – The Teaching Standard In The Liberty (2 hours later) \"Well done Swatowski, so same time tomorrow and for tomorrow I need you to remember the alphabet we learned today of by heart. Do you think you can do that.\" \"Sure can. Scarlet!\" He said happily. \"Once you know them, we can start to learn how to read words.\" I said picking up my folder. \"Later Swatowski.\" I said as he went out of the liberty. I smiled and put away the books we had used today while trying to find a new book to read tonight. I skimmed over all the books and found my childhood favourites. Black Beauty and Of Mice and Men. I smiled and added them on top of my folder. I signed them out and headed back to my cell. The next day in my cell (After practice) In my cell I had my CD player on playing My Chemical Romance, while I was reading 'Of Mice and Men', my childhood favourite. I was up to the part where Lennie and Curley get into a fight when Knauer knocked the door of my cell. \"Oy! Ass-wipe! Warden wants to see you.\" He ordered. I ripped out a piece of paper from my note book and slipped it into the page I was on before I closed it and put it under my pillow. I grabbed my hat, tied my long brown hair back and turned off my cd player before putting on my cap. \"What a pleasant surprise.\" I chimed, before I followed after him. He walked behind me and gave me a push every now and again, making me wanna kick him in his balls even more. Once we got to the wardens office I sat down outside while Knauer went in. I looked to the Secretary and she wasn't making eye contact with me. I sighed. I was too mean to her when I first came. So I stood up and walked over to her. \"Hey, I'm sorry for the way I acted when I first came here. It was out of order.\" I said and she turned to me and gave me a look. \"We cool?\" I asked holding my hand out. She smiled and shook it. \"Yes, we're okay.\" She said, I nodded and went to go sit back down. \"So why are you in here?\" She asked. \"No female prison had the space for me in England and Allenville was the only place in the world that would take me.\" I said. She shook her head. \"No I mean how come you're behind bars?\" She asked, I was about to answer when Knauer came back through the double doors of the Wardens office. \"Come on, bitch.\" He yelled forcing me to my feet. \"Hey, you do know I can get up my-self? Right?\" I asked. \"Just get in!\" He said, then pushed me into the room making me trip and fall to the floor. Hard. \"All the same.\" I said under my breath. I stood up and dusted myself off looking at the angered face of Warden Hazen. \"What the fuck do you think you are up too, inmate Lockhart?\" \"What do you mean, sir?\" I asked. \"Playing football, when you said you didn't know how too?\" \"No, I said that I was better at free-running and Basket-ball than rugby...\" \"IT'S FOOTBALL!\" \"Well what-ever. Anyway, what's it to you, now anyway? You got the help you wanted from Crewe so why so sour?\" I asked, standing my ground. \"Because I disapprove of my prisoners lying to me!\" He yelled again. I laughed. \"You really think you scare me?\" I asked. \"Pathetic.\" I laughed. \"That may be true, but I have a feeling that deep down…\" He said taking a step closer to me. I tried to step back feeling myself start to panic, but he held me where I was standing. \"You fear everyone in this prison.\" Knauer said; I forced his hand of me and stepped back. \"The only people who would be scared of you, Captain,\" I said spitting his name out like venom. \"Is 6 years old walking down the street, so don't falter yourself.\" I said then turn back to the warden. \"Anyway, football isn't the reason I called you here. According to a few guards, you have been teaching inmate Swatowski how to read.\" \"Yeah, so? Just cut to the chase, why is that of any significance to you?\" I said, plainly. \"Because, I was wondering if you could be a teacher to inmates just like Swatowski. Many of the inmates are only in Allenville because crime is the only occupation they can do, were you don't need qualifications or degrees. I was thinking that if you taught them the basics like English and maths, that could get them ahead in life so they can survive outside these walls when the time comes without ending back up here.\" \"Hey, I was just helping out a friend. I don't wanna teach a whole class. No, no, no, I can't do that, I just can't.\" I said shaking my head. \"I think you can do it. Because with you being the only female in this place, that you could attract,\" He said with a menacing smile. \"Quite a crowd.\" \"Yeah, but that would be like throwing me into the lion enclosure, covered it blood and wearing Lady Ga-Ga's meat dress. No, but even if I did want to. How could I do it? Without the proper resources? Without the correct equipment? Without a place to hold the classes?\" I said, \"You can use the mess hall for your classes. I will provide you and however many of the convicts with books, text books and stationary. So do we have a deal?\" He asked. \"Not right now. Right now I need to help the guys out with football.\" I said, \"Let me think about it till after the game.\" \"Fine it's a deal.\" He said. Then I walked out of there, supervised by Knauer. ked out of there, supervised by Knauer.[Chapter 10] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 10: Reasons for Imprisonment With Paul and Caretaker in my cell (Later that night) \"So the warden wants you to start like a prison school?\" Caretaker asked. I nodded as I stuck up a picture I had drawn from memory around my mirror. \"Yeah, a few guards grassed on me while I was teaching Swatowski how to read, now the warden wants me to make this school to help other cons learn English and math.\" I said, rubbing my face. \"I'm just worried that this would have clashed with football practice. So I turned him down till after the game.\" \"I think that might have been his intention.\" Crewe said. I nodded. \"Maybe, when I went in he had a go at me….\" \"He tried hitting on you?\" They both exclaimed. I gave them a look. \"No, he started to yell at me. We say have a go at me in England to say yelling.\" I said they nodded. \"So anyway he had a go at me because when I first came here he asked me if I was any good at football, and I told him I wasn't.\" \"But you are good.\" Caretaker said pulling out a piece of chocolate. \"Wanna bit?\" He asked us. I nodded and napped a piece off. \"It's only plain, but better than nothin'.\" He said. \"So why did you tell him you wasn't any good.\" Crewe asked me. I rubbed my hands together \"I dunno, he's probably seen my files and knows everything about me, except the obvious as in my personality, my likes, my dislike, hobbies you know stuff like that. I just didn't want to give out something he could us against me, you know.\" I said, and rested my chin in the palm of my hands. \"Don't worry about it. You did good Scar.\" Crewe said patting my back. \"Yeah, but why don't I feel like it?\" I said. \"Anyway, enough about me. Were you guys able to get Turley, Torres and Battle on the team?\" I asked. \"Well we got Torres and Battle. They'll be at practise tomorrow.\" Caretaker said, I nodded. \"What happened with Turley?\" I asked. \"Well I went to ask him but he was… preoccupied.\" Crewe said. I smiled. \"Why do you listen to this band Scar?\" Caretaker asked reading my black parade CD. \"I don't know, I just do.\" I said honestly. \"Why?\" \"Just asking.\" Caretaker asked. \"If you don't mind me asking, why are you guys locked up here?\" I asked them. \"You seriously cannot guess why I'm in here?\" Caretaker asked. \"I'm gonna guess, possession of illegal substances?\" Crewe asked, he shook his head. \"You'd think so wouldn't you?\" We looked at him in disbelief. \"I'm kidding!\" He laughed. \"Hit the nail right on the head, Mr. Crewe.\" He said, I smiled. \"What about you Crewe?\" \"You didn't see it on the ESPN news?\" He asked. \"No.\" We both said. \"Grand Theft auto, driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest, reckless endangerment and damage to public property.\" He said, I laughed. \"All while drunk?\" I asked. \"Yeah, then I watched myself on the news later, and I came out of my ex crush Bentley, looked helicam and yelled 'Hey Lena, I think we should start seeing other people' before I turned to the police surrounding me and said 'good news boy's, I didn't spill my beer'.\" He laughed. I nodded. \"So, why you in the prison house, baby?\" Caretaker asked me. \"Own cells, ladies!\" A guard called. Crewe and Caretaker rolled their eyes. \"See you tomorrow guys.\" I said, turning off my CD. \"Later Scar,\" They both said as they left the room. A few minutes later my cell door closed and I was locked inside. \"Night everyone.\" I said, I always said this, every night since I first came in here. For the first few days only Caretaker said goodnight. But soon everyone started saying goodnight to me. \"Night, Scar.\" Everyone said back. \"Hey Scar?\" I heard Megget ask. \"Yeah, what's up Megget?\" I asked. \"Why do you say good night to everyone? I mean half the people here you don't know.\" \"Well actually, I only know a handful of people and I say good night because it's the polite thing to do.\" I said climbing into my bed. \"Yo Scar, you are too damn nice to be in this joint. What you get done for?\" Caretaker asked. \"GBH and attempted murder.\" I said plainly. Then the whole cell block laughed. \"Yeah, right.\" Caretaker said. \"Thanks, dickheads. That means a lot.\" I said and laid down on my bed. \"Come on, Scar. What you really get put in here for baby?\" Megget asked. \"I already told you. GBH and attempted murder, can you leave me alone now?\" I asked then covered my head with my blanket, letting silent tears fall. The cell block then went quiet apart from a few small conversations going on.[Chapter 11] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 11: Shower, Beat Down and the new Running Back The next Morning I was reading the rest of 'Of mice and Men,\" and I was up to the part were Lennie accidently kills Curley's wife. I looked up, looking out the window to the beautiful sunrise. I smiled, imaging if I could fly away, I would and I would never look back. Just go on living, forgetting my past and just looking to my future. I shook my head and continued to read when I heard faint tapping on the cell doors. I looked over and it was Newman. I looked at the clock and it was about 6. Con weren't allowed out of their cells till half 8 so seeing Newman there surprised me. \"Hey Scarlet.\" Newman whispered. I turned around and gave him a small smiled I got up and walked over to the cell doors. \"Hey Newman, what's up?\" I whispered back. \"I came to get you. Grab a change of clothes and follow me.\" He said, unlocking my cell door. I had to admit I was scared but I knew I could trust Newman which was big at the moment. So I grabbed my jeans, my vest top and my hat along with a brush and bobble for my hair. I slipped on my trainers and followed after him to the Guards changing room. \"The guards won't be here for another two hours so you have enough time to shower.\" He said kindly handing me a towel. I smiled and put down my clothes on to a bench, before I entered the shower room. I took off my clothes, put them by the door, stepped under one of the shower head and turned it on letting the warm water flow down me. After 30 minutes, I had washed my body and hair. I wrapped the towel around my body and exited the shower room. I looked around and Newman was no were to be seen. I quickly dried my body and got changed into some clean clothes. I then dried my hair and combed it straight before I tied it up, and put my hat on. \"That was nice,\" I said to myself rubbing my neck. \"You finished?\" Newman asked. I jumped and turned round. \"Shit man, you scared the shit out of me.\" I said placing a hand on my chest. \"Sorry, but are ya?\" \"Yeah, I'm done. Thanks Newman.\" I said and he led me back to my cell. I sat down on my bed and continued to read my book. 2 hours later – In the mess hall We were all in the mess hall eating our breakfast of scrabbled egg and bacon and slice of toast. I wasn't in the mood to eat, so I was just pushing the food around with my fork. \"You know, this food looks like shit, but is actually pretty good.\" Caretaker said. I heard and lot of people agreeing. I scooped some of the food into my mouth and swallowed it down. I really wasn't hungry; I just pushed the tray away from me and stormed out. I felt guilty. It was 1 month ago, I nearly killed my so called Dad and I'm only starting to feeling guilty now? It makes no sense. But the guilt hit me like a tonne of hot bricks. I walked to the yard and wondered around a bit, till I came to an empty basketball court. I smiled and grabbed one of the two basket balls in the centre. I bounced the ball, catching it in my hands twice. Then I dribbled with it till I got to the basket and slam dunked it in. \"Yo, this is our court, woman.\" A voice said behind me. I picked up the ball and dribbled it over to a large group of African Americans, I guessed. \"Sorry, I just saw the court empty and was gonna shoot a few hoops.\" I said, chest passing the ball to the leader. He caught it and walked out of the court cage. \"Hey, hey, hey. Guys, come on. She's pretty cool. Let her stay,\" I heard Megget say. I turned around. \"Yeah, come back Scar.\" He said, grabbing hold of my hand. \"Okay, are you guys sure?\" I asked the others. \"Yeah, I'm Deac.\" The leader said holding out his hand. \"Nice you met you man, I'm Scarlet.\" I said shaking his hand. \"Can you play ball, Scar?\" Deac asked. I smiled sheepishly and shrugged my shoulders. \"I'm not bad, but I ain't good either.\" I said and he passed me the ball. \"Try getting it in that hoop there,\" He said pointing to the furthest hoop from where I was. I took a step forward but Deac stopped me. \"From here, baby.\" He said, I nodded and aimed for the hoop. I took a deep breath and jumped. I flicked my wrist and the ball slipped from my hand and flew to the hoop. I smiled, I knew I got it in. The ball hit the top right corner of the inner rectangle, spun round on the hoop before it lost momentum and dropped through. \"I have a pretty good aim.\" I said. Deac and Megget nodded. \"Nice shot. Yeah, you can chill here Baby.\" He said, I smiled. \"Thanks, Deac.\" I said and walked over the bleachers. I sat there for a few hours, watching the guys play football, got into a few conversation and then eventually got into a game. My team was winning 18 to 14 on game's 21. When Crewe, Caretaker and Nate. \"Shit, \" I thought. \"I completely forgot about practise .\" I walked over to him. \"Sorry, Crewe. I completely forgot about practise.\" I said to him. \"It's alright, don't forget tomorrow.\" He said, \"Alright, thanks Crewe.\" \"Hey, yo, check out this fake Slim Shady, man.\" Midget said. Then Cheeseburger came over. \"I knew you couldn't resist my shit. I got the shakes that'll make you quake. I got the fries that'll cross your eyes. I got the burgers that'll…\" He said. I whispered in his ear. \"I got the burgers that will be your murderers, and that is the Cheeseburger special.\" I laughed and high fived him. \"I'm all right. Thank you.\" He said brushing past him. \"I'll take one Cheeseburger.\" I said giving him 2 dollars I hustled off some guys the other day who thought I could beat them across the obstacle course in the guy. He gave me a cheese burger but didn't take my money. \"Yo, babe. No pay, you're cool.\" I smiled. \"Thanks man.\" I said taking a bite. It was cold but I didn't care. I walked over to Crewe who was talking to the others. \"Just wanted to talk to you fellas about possibly joining the football team.\" He asked, which was greeted by an assortment of laughter. \"The only game we'd play with you is 'Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch'.\" Deac said, then Cheeseburger started doing the robot… really well. \"Baby-back bitch, baby-back bitch Baby-back bitch.\" Cheeseburger chanted. I laughed. \"That's a big-ass robot.\" Caretaker said. \"Yeah. You gonna help me out here?\" Crewe asked. Caretaker gave him a look and then slipped away. \"Thank you, Half-a-Star.\" He said to himself. \"Just so you know, we are playing the guards.\" He said walking towards them a bit. Deac laughed. \"That ain't a team. That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks giving themselves excuses to grab each other.\" I smiled, that was good. Crewe smiled too and pointed at Deac. \"This guy must be quite the athlete, huh?\" Crewe asked. Deac squared up to him. \"You risk bringing your ass in the jungle because you know I am.\" He warned. \"Yeah, so you'd beat me in a game of one-on-one, right?\" My smile dropped. I turned him to face me. \"What are you doing? Can you even play?\" I asked him. \"I can play basketball.\" \"Yeah, but I've played with these guys, you're gonna get your ass kicked and then handed to you on a silver platter. Are you sure you wanna do this?\" I asked. \"Is he for real?\" Megget asked. \"I think it's time for you to get stepping.\" Deac said. \"How's this, though? One game. I beat you, you guys play for the team. You beat me, I'll leave you alone.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Take that. Take that, Deac.\" Melson cheered. \"This fool ain't nothing but a thing, baby.\" \"Ball, dog.\" Deac said. Deac crew cheered and laughed. \"Ball up!\" Cheeseburger added. I shook my head and patted his shoulder. \"Good luck, Crewe,\" I said. \"You gonna need it.\" Then I walked over to Caretaker and Nate. \"He's gonna get creamed.\" I said covering my eyes. \"Can Crewe play ball?\" Caretaker asked, I shrugged my shoulder. \"He told me he can, but to what extent? That territory is still to be determined.\" I said. \"He's a natural athlete, you guys.\" Nate said. \" Game's 11. Call your own fouls.\" Deac said passing the ball to Crewe. \"Can't deny that, man.\" I said, with a smile. \" Okay.\" Crewe said. \"Yeah, but so is Greg Louganis, but I bet you he'd get his ass whopped out here.\" Caretaker said. I laughed. Then we just watched. Crewe was on offence and Deac was on defence. They were both making there was to the basket, Deac blocking Crewe from the ball, then BANG! Deac threw his elbow back right into Crewe's face. I covered my eyes and looked away. I may be in here for GBH and attempted murder but violence still fazes me. \" Shit! That had to hurt !\" I thought to myself. I turned back and saw Crewe on the ground holding his nose, with Deac standing over him. \" Did I get you?\" Deac asked. \" No, that was clean.\" Crewe answered patting the side of Deac's leg, before her got back to his feet. \"He'll be all right. Call his mama.\" Megget yelled over everyone. He looked at me and flashed a smile, which I returned. \"If I foul you, tell me, dog.\" Deac said bouncing the ball on the spot. \"Okay, baby.\" Crewe smiled. Crewe got back into offence position and Deac started shoulder barging at him. When they got close to the basket, Crewe moved out of the way and Deac fall to the floor, with the basketball going off the court. \"What happened there? I think it's my ball, right?\" He asked; I smiled. He may have a chance. \"Get up! Get up, Deac!\" Cheeseburger Eddy chanted. \"Come on, Paul!\" Nate cheered. Caretaker patted his shoulder. \"Calm down.\" Caretaker whispered. \"What?\" Nate asked. \"Now, don't stir up the brothers, now. Come on.\" He continued. I rolled my eyes. \"Oh, come on, now, Caretaker. What are they going to do?\" \"Nothing to you, guys have morals, it's what they could do to us is what I'm worried about.\" \"Well that seems smart.\" I said and watched them play. Crewe bounced the ball on the spot and when Deac tried to get the ball off him, Crewe bounces the ball behind him and to the side. He threw it to the basket but it bounced off the edge. Crewe grabbed the ball again and as he was about to try again Deac tackled into him and knocking him into the metal post with a clang. Me and Caretaker jumped back. Crewe slowly pulled away and held his top teeth. \"Did I get you, dog?\" Deac asked with an evil smile. \"Hell, no, baby. That was clean. Good D,\" Crewe said with a smile and they walked back to the middle of the half court. \"I thought he didn't wanna get hurt.\" Caretaker asked. I nodded. \"It ain't about getting hurt. It's about pride.\" Nate said. \"I bet you he's pretty proud right now.\" \"Yeah but there's pride and there's acting like a retard.\" I said, making them both laugh. The basketball match went on for another hour before they reach game point. Crewe was beaten down at every corner, being punched, thrown, and dragged and tripped at every chance Deac got. It was hard to watch but I had to show him my support. \"You keep coming, huh?\" Deac said surprised, bouncing the ball on the stop. Crewe nodded and got into position. \"Game point, baby.\" Deac smiled. \"How you want the game put up?\" He said, then went for the basket, bashing into Crewe again. Then as he was about to pick up the ball, Crewe put his hand in the way, the ball went free. Crewe grabbed it and scored. I cheered along with Nate and Caretaker but no one on Deac side was cheering. I looked at Deac and he did not look happy. \"Foul.\" He said plainly. Crewe smiled in disbelief and took a few steps back. \"What?\" I asked. \"Why would he do that?\" I asked. Nate looked pissed. \"That was a bullshit call!\" Nate yelled. \"My court, my ball.\" He said. Crewe shook his head and passed Deac the ball. Deac caught it and threw it at the back board. It bounced off, Deac jumped caught it and slam dunked it in. His group cheered. I smiled sadly but clapped for Deac's 'victory'. I walked up to Crewe and patted him on the shoulder. \"All right, y'all. Let Deac speak!\" Cheeseburger said as the group ganged up around us. \"Nice spanking that ass, dog. Now, get stepping.\" Deac said and as they were about to walk. A lone voice called out. \"Hold up.\" Megget said and walked out in front of us. He flashed me another smile. I smiled back. \"Y'all got a running back?\" He asked. \"Not any good ones.\" Crewe said, drained. I rolled my eyes. Gee that was nice, not like that hurt my feelings at all. Megget turned to Deac. \"No disrespect, Deac... but any man that can take that kind of beating out here,\" He then turned to Crewe with a determined smile. \"I can't wait to see what he can do in a contact sport. Shit, I'm in.\" Megget said. I smiled. \"Thank you.\" I mouthed. Cheeseburger charged up to him and took his Cheeseburger away from him. \"Man, give me that cheeseburger.\" He mopped. I rolled my eyes. \"You're acting like a real McAsshole.\" He said shaking Megget's cheeseburger. Deac walked up to him and placed a hand on Cheeseburgers shoulder. \"Cheeseburger, he wants to run with the white boys, we will let him. Let's do this. Later Scarlet.\" He said. I smiled and nodded. \"Later guys.\" I said, then they walked away. I turned to Megget. \"Thank you.\" I said. \"No problem.\" He said, I let him go and he turned to Crewe. He held out his hand. \"Earl Megget.\" \"Paul Crewe.\" He said. \"So who else is on the team?\" Megget asked. \"You, me, Scar here…\" Oh, so now he includes me… wait… oh! I get it… very cleaver. \"What does Scar do?\" Megget asked and I could just see in his eye he was hoping I was going to be a cheerleader. \"Running back.\" Megget looked at me. I smiled and held my arms out. He shook his head. \"Cool. But wait? How is that going to work with two running backs?\" Megget asked. I stepped in between them and held a hand on my wrist. \"I don't mind being a back-up running back. As long as I can still practise with you guys.\" I said. Crewe smiled. \"Thanks Scar.\" I smiled. \"Hey, I'm a team player.\" I said, pulling Megget into a head lock and gave him a nuggie. \"Hey! Get off!\" Megget laughed pulling out of my weak head lock. I looked up and Crewe wasn't there anymore. I looked around and then looked to the ground and he was out cold. \"Gotta admit, I don't blame him. He took one hell of a beating off Deac.\" I said, Megget and Caretaker, who just came now picked him up and took him back to his cell.[Chapter 12] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 12 – Trust is the Hardest thing to heal 1 hour later in Megget's cell \"So how much longer do you think he's gonna be out for?\" I asked Megget. Megget shrugged his shoulders. \"I dunno, to be honest.\" He said hiding 3 books under his pillow. \"Do you like to read too?\" I asked, Megget looked at me and smiled sheepishly. \"Yeah, it's just something to past the time really. How's Swatowski's lessons going anyways?\" He asked, changing the subject. \"Great, he can read at a basic level but is doing really well.\" I said then I noticed a picture of Megget with a woman and a little girl. \"Who are they?\" I asked, He gave me a look and followed my gaze to a picture. \"That's my sister, Chantey and her little girl Kayla.\" He said with a smile. \"Do you miss them?\" I asked. He nodded. \"Every day, uh, Kayla was about 5 in this picture and that was taken about 4 years ago.\" He said. \"Man she was such a sweet thing. She always used her manners.\" I laughed. \"I was like that when I was little.\" I said; he smiled. \"I think everyone is. I mean when she was 3, she was drawing on the cupboards and I was in the way. I didn't realize she was doing it till she asked me to move. It's still so cute when I think about it. She tugged on my jean leg and said 'Excuse me please'. I had to go and get Chantey to get her to stop she was so cute.(AN: This really happened with my sister's boyfriend, now my brother in law. He really had to go get my mum to make me stop lol)\" \"I always wanted a little sister or brother but, my mum and my d… dad never wanted another. Always said I was enough.\" I said sadly. \"I miss my Mum.\" I said out loud. \"I know you do, can she come a visit?\" He asked. I shook my head. \"Sorry, I'm gonna go.\" I said feeling tear coming to my eyes. I never really mourned for my Mum when she died and every time someone or I think or talk about her I cry. Megget grabbed my hand softly. \"Hey, you don't have ta go.\" He said. \"Do you?\" He asked. I nodded and sat back down. \"It's just my Mum died when I was 12 and I never really cried for her. We were really close but I just hate crying. It makes me feel weak and pathetic.\" I said honestly. \"Hey, everyone has to cry. You know, and it isn't weak or pathetic. Everyone has to do it sometimes, even me.\" He said, whispering the last part making me laugh. \"Thanks Megget.\" I said. \"You're a great friend.\" I said. He nodded and rubbed my back. \"You're welcome.\" \"Do you mind if I ask you how you got in here?\" I asked. He laughed with a smile. \"On one condition,\" He said. \"What condition?\" I asked, having a bad feeling. \"If I tell you my story… you have to tell me yours.\" He said, pulling out a cigarette. \"Fine.\" I said, knowing I was defeated. \"Okay.\" \"Me, Deac and Cheeseburger were arrested for armed robbery and resisting arrest. We got high on some shit and robbed a gas station or something, got caught and here we are.\" \"Well, I got arrested for GBH and attempted murder.\" I said hoping that he wouldn't push it any more than that. \"How did you get that conviction?\" I took in a deep breath and exhaled loudly. \"My Dad… uh,\" I said. \"I kicked my Dad out of a two story window when I went back to England to visit a friend…\" I blurted out. \"In self-defence. But I took too long to do it.\" I whispered, I then got up and left. \"Scarlet, wait!\" Megget said as he came out of his cell. But I kept walking back to my cell when I bumped into Knauer. \"Sorry.\" I said and continued to walk. \"Oy! Get here!\" He said roughly grabbing my arm. Which was exactly the way my so called 'Dad' grabbed me when... Flashback \" Come here, you little slut!\" He said with a sickly sweet evil smirk across his horrid face. His breath ricked of alcohol. I tried to get away but he grabbed my arm hard that I let out a scream. He punched me in the face and I fell to the ground. It's not like I wasn't used to him hitting me but I was 25, not 14. I should have seen it coming, but it still took me by surprise. He picked me up and threw me against the wall. The impact was hard but didn't break anything. I lay still to try and scare him, thinking he killed me. He slowly walked over to me and kicked me in the chest. I cried out in pain and got punched in the face again. I needed to fight back but I couldn't, he's my step-dad and even though he beat me senceless for 8 years, I still love him. \" Why!\" I cried, \"What did I do to you?\" \" What does that have to do with anything! You're a slut and a complete waste of life. You deserve everything you got coming!\" He said pulling out a knife. When I saw it, I filled with fear. \" Now you let me do what I want or you'll be found without a head.\" He said placing the knife near my neck. He then grabbed the zipper of my jeans. My eyes widened. \" Oh, God! Please don't do this!\" I begged, tears falling. He then punched me in the face and proceeded to undo my jeans. \"Please don't!\" I begged again, full on crying in both fear and humiliation. \" Shut up you fucking piece of trash.\" He yelled and punched me again in the face. 20 minutes later he had done what he needed and got up off me. I lay shocked and scared on the floor, because now he's gonna kill me. He's no father of mine, no step dad of mine. He's a monster now. \" Now I've had my fun,\" He said sickeningly. \"Prepare to meet your maker.\" He said, he pulled me to my feet and threw me against the wall again but I stood up right away and pulled my fists up to my face. \"Aww, the poor little girl is trying at act all tough.\" He laughed. \" Just try anything else. You'll regret it.\" I sobbed, he laughed and pulled out the knife. I ran to him and spin kicked the knife out of his hand. I jumped, swapped from my right leg to my left and kicked him in the face. I then punched his repetitively in the face and he stumbled backward towards the window. I stopped. \" You little slut! I'm gonna fucking kill…\" I didn't want him to finish that sentence so I kicked him the chest and he went flying out the window. I gasped and ran to the window and looked down just as soon as he hit the floor. Then lay motionless, I smiled. I was free I was finally free. Sadly I'm gonna get put in jail for murder but once they know the truth, that he had been physically abusing me for years and that tonight he abused me… sexually. The judge and jury will be in my favour. I slid to the floor and cried. I must have been like that for 45 minutes because then the police kicked down the door and aimed their guns at me. I uncurled myself and held my hands up. I had to put my jeans and underwear back on that that animal ripped off. They put me in cuffs and lead me down stairs. The whole time I didn't say a word, and I just cried silently. \" His pulse is weak, we need to get him to the hospital as soon as.\" My legs just dropped and I went mental. \" NO! HE SOULDN'T HAVE A HEART BEAT! HE'S A COLD HEARTLESS MONSTER! HE SOULD BE DEAD! HE DESERVERS TO DIE!\" I screamed and cried then they threw me in the back of the police car. But I didn't stop screaming. \"HE SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE WHEN HE RAPED ME! He should be dead. He shouldn't be on his way to hospital.\" I cried. \" Wait? He raped you?\" One of the police men asked. I nodded and burst out crying. End of flashback I swung at him, but he caught it and twisted it behind my back then threw me to the ground. \"Don't try that again, slut.\" He said, and then walked away. \"I'm sorry…\" I said. Then I get a tap of my shoulder. I jumped and tried to slide away. \"No! Leave me alone!\" I cried. \"Scar, calm down. It's just me.\" Crewe said. I looked up. \"What did Knauer do to you?\" He asked with anger burning in his eyes as he rubbed my back gently. \"Knauer did nothing, I just mistook him for someone else.\" I said, and I got to my feet. \"I'm fine.\" I said. \"Okay, if you're sure?\" He asked doubtfully. \"I'm fine. Honestly.\" I said, with a fake smile. Crewe walked with me to my cell and I stayed there for the rest of the day.[Chapter 13] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 13 - Fresh Meat and Cheerleaders? The next day (At Practice) Today I was feeling much better and I was at practice today. Right now Megget was getting in place for the practise game against the offence team. Tony got down looking at Megget. I was standing on the side lines, practising my kicking. \"Let's get this over with, rookie, I'm starving.\" Tony said, I laughed and shook my head. When is he not starving. I shook my head and focused. \"Fresh meat, boys! Fresh meat!\" I heard Battle yell. I turned to watch the game. \"Down, set!\" Crewe yelled and got into position. \"Battle, you're a psycho! Tony, you're a fat shit! Hut!\" The ball was passed to Crewe. But it slipped out of his hands. Crewe dived for the ball and hit it to Megget. Megget caught and dodged Swatowski's attack by spinning to the left, then he set off like a bolt of lightning, dodging tackles and running to the end zone like his life depended on. \"Go Megget!\" I cheered with happiness. \"Holy shit!\" I heard Crewe say as he took off his helmet. I ran over to him. \"I think I'm out of a job Crewe.\" I joked. \"Na, we still need a back-up, just in case but Holy shit! He is fast.\" He said patting my shoulder. We walked towards Megget who was running back holding his right shoe. \"Ran right out of your shoes, huh? Hey, manager, don't you think we can get our new star running back a decent pair of cleats?\" Crewe asked Caretaker \"Yeah. I think I got a cousin that drives a truck for Reebok.\" He said. \"Is that how you get most of your intakes? From your family?\" I asked. \"Anything except drugs, I can get from my family. I have mates who send the drugs in.\" \"It's cool, man. I never had shoes growing up no way. I'll be all right for now.\" Megget said with a smile. \"Oh, okay.\" Crewe laughed. \"Get your country ass back in the huddle. That boy got some slave feet, you see that?\" \"Megget!\" I called after him. He turned round. \"I just wanted to say, I'm sorry about yesterday. It's just the reason I got locked up brings up a lot, that I need to forget about.\" \"It's alright, I get it. It's a sensitive subject.\" I nodded. \"I just need some time to trust people again.\" He nodded. \"I get it.\" He said. I smiled and gave him a high five. \"Thanks.\" \"Defence!\" Nate yelled behind us. \"Huddle up over there.\" He yelled pointing by the record building. I looked at Megget. \"Come on, let's get to the huddle.\" Megget said. I nodded and we walked towards the defence huddle. \"Paul! Paul!\" Danny AKA Beyoncé Guy called. Crewe turned round. \"Hey, ladies. How's it hanging?\" \"I'm gonna say something to him.\" She said to her friends. \"I just wanted to let you know I am your biggest fan. And I will be cheering my jailhouse boobies,\" She said, holding her chest. \"Off for you at game day.\" I looked at Megget and he looked at me and I just rolled my eyes. \"I appreciate that. Thank you.\" Crewe said then turned back into the huddle. \"Paul.\" Danny called again. Crewe looked back. \"I appreciate you.\" \"Oh my God.\" I said and slapped my face. \"Okay, thanks. I'm glad to know that.\" \"Okay, are you done now?\" Brucie asked. \"God I hope so.\" Megget said. I laughed and high fived him. \"What's wrong with you?\" He asked, confused. \"Jealous because I don't cheer for you anymore?\" She asked. What? \"I don't know what you're talking about, freak show.\" Brucie said in defence. \"Whatever, back freckles.\" He said, doing a really girly click. \"Oh, yeah, back freckles. She's making up shit now. I'm gonna get some water.\" He said then walked away. \"Okay, everyone take 5.\" Crewe said. I walked over to the Girl/guys. \"Yo, Lentlemen.\" I said, making them laugh. \"Hey, what's up girl friend?\" Danny asked. \"I was thinking. Every football team has a cheer leading squad. And I know you guys want to help out in the cause. So why don't you guys…\" I said pointing at all of them. \"Be the teams cheerleading squad?\" I asked. They started to giggle with excitement. \"We'll do it. Thanks girl.\" \"No problem baby. See you around.\" I said then went over to Crewe, Caretaker, Nate and Megget. \"Scar, why were you talking to them? I thought you said they were too forceful?\" Caretaker asked. \"Well they are, but you guys can see that they want to help out so I told them to be our cheerleaders. Plus it'll keep them out of our way while we're practising.\" I said. Crewe smiled. \"I like the idea. Well done Scar,\" Megget said. \"Thanks.\" I said with a proud smile.[Chapter 14] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 14 - I Get Knocked down… \"… Then, they finally get their sentence fulfilled and are both hanged, ending the story.\" I told him me and Megget on the way to practice. Megget and me have become really close as have Caretaker and Crewe. We are a close band of friends now and I am grateful. So far only Megget knows half of my story, but he promised to let me tell in my own time. \"That's a pretty sad story.\" He said. \"It was,\" I said. \"But Capote did the family justice with the book, wrote it beautifully.\" \"Alright! Everyone get into formation! Scarlet, you're running back today.\" Crewe said. I nodded and put on my helmet. \"Good luck.\" Megget said. I smiled. \"Thanks Megget.\" I said and jogged to my position. I stretched my legs while the guys were getting it their position then I felt a shadow walk past me. I turned round and jumped in surprise. \"Crewe?\" I asked, fear radiating from my voice. He turned to me. \"Is Turley on Offence or Defense?\" He smiled. \"Don't worry he's on offence.\" I smiled and got into position. From where I was, I could hear Swatowski laugh as well as see his hand waving. I smiled. \"Turley, no one gets to me, we'll play more ping pong later.\" Crewe said. I turned and Turley gave Crewe the okay sign which he returned. \"Hut!\" He announced and I ran. Crewe back up and I ran to an open position. As I turned back I saw Swatowski charge for Crewe as he threw the ball. Yet out of the corner of my eye, I saw Turley, calm as a lamb lift his foot up and Swatowski ran right into it. He fell to the floor and a painful cry filled the air. \"Fucking Hell!\" I yelled and ran to Swatowski as he was getting up. \"Alright.\" Crewe said. \"Ah, he 'broke-ed my nose!\" He cried, clearly really worked up. He angrily took off his helmet and went to throw it at Turley but stopped himself and threw it on the ground. \"I don't wanna play no more!\" He said and let out a cry. \"No! Don't quit Swatowski! We need you.\" I said patting his shoulder. \"Hey, hey, hey. Swatowski, what are you talking about? This is football. Shit happens.\" Crewe said plainly. \"Paul, he 'broke-ed' my nose.\" He said and pulled his hands away to see his nose was crocked. \"Stop crying,\" Crewe said as he placed his hands around Swatowski's nose. \"All right. We can fix this. Here we go.\" Then pushed down hard on the bent part of his nose. Swatowski let out a painful cry which was followed by a cracking nose. I cringed. \"Okay. Good, good.\" I looked at Swatowski's nose and it looked like it did the last time I saw him. \"How's it look?\" Swatowski sniffed. \"How's it look? It looks... It looks like... It looks better than before.\" Crewe said which brought a big smiled to Swatowski's face. \"Really?\" He asked excitedly \"Yeah, it's straighter. More distinguished. Kind of like a young Michael Jackson.\" Caretaker said, I shook my head. \"I love little Michael.\" \"That's great. That's great.\" Crewe smiled, patting his arm. The Swatowski's face went serious. \"I think he did it on purpose.\" He said. \"No, he didn't.\" He said and looked to Turley who had a smile on his face and was nodding. \"Okay, maybe he did.\" Crewe said then walked over to him. \"You gotta apologize to him. Come on, Turley. Say you're sorry. Come on. Say it.\" Turley looked down in disgust but looked at Swatowski and rolled his eyes. \"I'm sorry.\" Then a smiled grew on Swatowski's face and he walked over to the others. \"He said he's sorry. I got him to say he's sorry.\" \"Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed.\" Battle said. So after that Crewe went through with Turley what he can and can't do which included not kicking people in the face that were gonna tackle him. Then, after ten minutes we started another game. I got into position and waited. \"Blue 32, Blue 32, HUT!\" He said and went back. I sped off and Crewe threw the ball. I caught it and ran for the end zone. Battle was the first to charge at me. I ran towards him and when he dived for me, I threw it to Crewe and then crouched down to the floor as close as I could. Because of my small physique missing Battle's tackle by inches. I got up and Crewe passed me the ball and I ran for the end zone. Swatowski was next to tackle and I threw the ball to Brucie, who caught it for once and I did the splits as he dived over me. I got back up and Brucie gave the ball back to me before he got leveled by Tony, I caught it and ran for the end zone once again at full speed. \"Scar look out!\" Megget yelled. Next thing I know, I was tackled from behind by Battle. On the way down I stretched my arm out holding the ball as far out as I could get it. I dropped to the floor and hit my head on the ground, hard and I blacked out.[Chapter 15] Survival Of The Fittest By I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 15 - I Get Up Again When I regained consciousness, I was facing the sky with the blurry images of Crewe, Caretaker, Megget, Skitchy and Nate looking down at me. Seconds later my vision normalized and Crewe, Megget and Caretaker were kneeling down next to me while Nate and Skitchy where standing. \"Scar? You okay?\" Nate asked. I looked him. \"Fuck that, did I get a touch down?\" I asked. Making them laugh. \"She's okay.\" Caretaker laughed as Crewe and Megget helped me to my feet. \"Did I score?\" I asked again. \"Yep.\" Crewe laughed. \"Can you still play?\" I nodded. \"Yeah, I'm alright. I was just too slow on that play, to relaxed.\" I said, knowing what my mistakes were and how I needed to improve. As you can sort of tell I am a bit of a perfectionist. \"Alright, Baby. We can work on that.\" Crewe said patting my back. \"Oh and just so you know, your bleeding.\" He said as he walked away. I pulled my hand up to the left side of my forehead and pulled it away to find blood on my hand. I wiped the blood off, and went back to the game. I put my helmet back on. We played a few games till lunch then we called it a day. \"Looking good, guys. Way to work hard.\" Crewe said as we walked away, taking a drink of water from his cup. \"Good practice, Paul! Me and the girls wanna show you what we've been practicing.\" He called out. I turned along with Crewe. \"Okay, hit me.\" Crewe said. They then spaced out. \"Come on, let's go. One, two, three.\" Eastie said, they then rolled their hips to the left. \"Give me a... D, D, give me a I I, I, give me a C, C, give me a...\" Basically their cheer spelled out dicks and the 'K' involved to of them visualizing the act of anal sex. I looked away. \"Holy shit.\" I thought. \"All right, all right! I got it. Just save it for the game.\" Crewe waved before he turned round. \"Don't act like you ain't want to see more, Brucie!\" Danny said. I turned to Brucie. \"Yeah, you wish, pal.\" He yelled back. \"No, you wish I'd kiss you again, because your breath smell like eight cans of shark shit.\" Danny said plainly. I laughed so hard at that I ended up on the floor. I got back up and high-fived him. Just wanted to say Thank you to everyone to have favorite and followed me and this story. Thank you so much guys, and also to apologize for the slow updates on this story. It's more of a side project for when i have writers block... so yeah...[Chapter 16] Survival Of The Fittest I Know Love Hurts 2010 Chapter 16: The Bearer of Bad News The Next Day ~ In the mess hall I was in the line, getting my dinner and Unger was dishing the food out again. I rolled my eyes and walked across the line only this time I had Battle on one side and Swatowski on the other. \"Well, well, well, baby. Long time, no see. Are you avoiding me or something?\" He asked, with a flirtatious smirk. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. \"Not anymore. Just wait till there isn't anything in my way and I'm sure you'll like the outcome.\" I said flirtatiously. He moved closer trying to get a kiss in, I leaned in then grabbed his head and smashed it on the steel rimed glass. An echo of 'Oh!', filled to room. He stood back up confused then fell back-wards out cold. \"When I say no, I fucking mean no! You fucking retard!\" I said to his unconscious body. Then another con in the kitchen reluctantly took his place and put the food on my plate. \"Please don't hurt me.\" He begged. The guy was pretty young and then I realized he was one of the three guys who ganged up on me on my first day and the one I actually didn't beat up. \"No, that fuck-tart has had that coming a long time.\" I said. \"Thanks.\" Then I walked off, followed by Battle and Swatowski. \"Nicely done,\" Battle laughed. I nodded as we sat down with Crewe. \"Holy shit, Scar! What did you do?\" Crewe asked. I was about to answer when Battle did it for me. \"She knocked Unger out, it was insane! Who knew someone of your size had that much strength.\" \"Yeah, but you also have to take into account that I'm a black belt in every self-defense out there.\" I said, \"Also, that little dick weed has had it coming for weeks.\" \"Scar, you've got a letter.\" Megget said coming over with his tray followed by Caretaker. He sat down next to me and gave it to me. \"That's weird, who would want to write me a letter?\" I thought as I opened it. ' Dear, Scarlet Lockhart, I'm sure you will be pleased to hear that your step-father, Daniel Lockhart, will be discharge from the hospital tomorrow at full health. He has also asked for visitation rights to talk to you. Please reply as soon as you can Louise, (Daniels nurse) ' Reading the letter my blood was boiling, and my anger grew more and more. My hands shook at the rage I was feeling inside my veins as the uncontrollable emotion filled every part of my body. I slammed the letter onto the table and stormed out of the mess hall.

Hi there, and welcome to the first chapter of my 58th story. My good friend Kat, from Greece, is currently in the process of writing an awesome story called \"Right In The Hunt.\" Basically, the story's main characters are me and her. As it is nearly Christmas, and I should like to finish this story before my family comes, I am doing one as well. For the first few chapters, it is just the two of us looking forward to Christmas, but then we will eventually find ourselves in the world of the Polar Express. I do hope you enjoy it. For the first time in a long time, snow was blanketing the city of Athens as the Greeks got ready for the Christmas season. One particular person, a fifteen year old girl by the name of Katja was in the process of sending a private message to a friend, all the while wondering when Greece was last covered in so much snow. The flakes of white gently floating down from the heavens made her smile. Christmas, with all its snow, was truly spectacular, and the lights and decorations of the city made everything look magical. Katja just smiled, and moving away from her laptop, she approached the eastern window, and just relished in all the beauty of Christmas that Athens was showing. It really does look magical, she thought to herself, and wondered what her parents had planned for Christmas Day. Usually, she was allowed to open a present on Christmas Eve, then open her stocking when she first woke up on Christmas Day. Then, after breakfast, she opened the rest of her presents, went to church and sang Carols, then had a huge Christmas Dinner with her parents, her cousins and their parents, and even on occasion, her uncle Fredrick, who lived in Wellington. As she turned away from her window, a picture on her chest of drawers made her smile. It was a picture of two girls sitting together in a beautiful park, one arm wrapped around each other, the other making a peace sign. One of the girls was Katja herself, wearing a dark green t-shirt saying \"I love NZ,\" and a pair of black three-quarter pants. The other girl was a good friend of hers, Sapphire Stone, and Katja couldn't work out why the girl liked wearing dresses and skirts. In the photo, Sapphire was wearing a red dress that went to her knees, black footless tights, and long black boots. I miss you, Sapphy, the girl thought to herself, just as her mother called her from downstairs. When she arrived, Katja saw that her mother and father were looking perplexed about something. \"What's up?\" She asked, and her mother said, \"We're having trouble reading this poem.\" Kat rolled her eyes, and held her hand out for the poem. \"Can't be that hard to read, surely.\" She said, and began to read the poem. \"Merry Christmas, darling daughter Can you bring us a glass of wwater? The Christmas treee stands tall and bright What a wonder, whaat a sight. Golden baubles, brranches green Make this room a magic dreeam. Presents ggalore, and Santa Claus too Will bring a smile to the face of yoou. French Vaniilla icecream, and lovely Christmas pie Are what await you, inn your destination-bye. Ggreece is always lovely, att this time oof year Spellinng mistakes are never nice to see or hear. Zzero fun you will not have on our holiday Ffor Christmas will be cool foor you, everry single day. Ccaius was a mean guy, in thhe Twilight Saga On holiday at some point, yourr father wiill want ssome lagar. Ttoday it's cold, tommorrow not so Aand where we are going, there shall be no ssnow. Add the mistakes together, work out all the clues And you shall see a sentence that will delight you. You will jump for joy, you shall cry \"Hooray!\" When you discover where we are going on our holiday.\" Katja stared blankly at the poem, wondering what on earth Caius from Twilight had anything to do with Christmas. Then she had another read of the poem, now more aware of all the spelling mistakes, and picked up the green pen that was lying somewhat abandoned on the table. She began circling the mistakes and writing them down. When she had finished, she looked more baffled than ever, for she had written: wearegoingtonzforchristmas. \"Is that even a real word?\" She asked, pointing at it, amidst the laughter of her parents. \"No, it's a sentence,\" her father said, chuckling, as his daughter's brow furrowed for a moment, before she suddenly let out a shriek of joy, and re-wrote the sentence as it should have been: We are going to NZ for Christmas. \"You guys are awesome!\" She squealed delightedly, as she wrapped her arms around her mother and father. \"We sure are, and you can spend some time with your friend, if you want to. I suggest you go and pack, 'cause we leave this evening.\" Katja, knowing to pack summer clothes, raced away, a huge grin on her face. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Sapphire Stone sent her friend a private message, asking her what she was doing for Christmas , all the while humming Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" to herself. Glancing at the time on her laptop screen, she saw that it read twenty-five to ten, so she used that time to have a nice cold shower and read before she fell asleep at ten. Just before she did so, she decided to check her FanFiction inbox, and saw that there were no new messages. This didn't worry her though, so she wrote \"Goodnight, Kat.\" Before turning off her laptop, and fell asleep, dreaming of the coming Christmas Production, in which she had a fair-sized part. A.N. And that's a wrap. Hope you enjoyed it :) Kat's uncle Fredrick is named after my uncle, who passed away in 2008.[Chapter 2] A Lovely Surprise A.N. Yeah, another chapter :) Well, I don't own much of the story, apart from my own ideas. Anyway, enough babbling. Let's get on with the show :) Previously: This didn't worry her though, so she wrote \"Goodnight, Kat.\" Before turning off her laptop, and fell asleep, dreaming of the coming Christmas Production, in which she had a fair-sized part. She was to be playing the role of a ghost in Charles' Dickens \"A Christmas Carol,\" but not one of the three ghosts that Scrooge was familiar with. She was playing the Ghost of Understanding Christmas, a character that had been brought to life when she had suggested an idea for the production. However, wanting it to be a huge surprise for her family, she had said nothing about the play, and only practiced her lines when they weren't home. Speaking of her family, whenever she mentioned \"FanFiction\" or her friend Kat, from Greece, her parents would smile at each other in a secretive way, as if they knew something about her friend that she didn't. Whenever they did this, Sapphire would simply shake her head in some annoyance, and gaze at the beautiful Christmas Tree with it's very unique decorations. Most of them, if not all of them, came from Budapest in Hungary, where her grandparents used to live, although when she was younger, Sapphire felt quite certain that they lived at the airport, because that was where she generally saw them. She also had a golden Eiffle Tower, which her grandmother had given her as her annual Christmas decoration. She generally placed it just below the Christmas Star, because even Paris is lower than Heaven. She now smiled at it, as she ate waffles, checking her phone for messages. There was still nothing from Kat, so the girl assumed that her friend was busy, and right now, she'd be asleep. Her mum happened to pass by at that moment, carrying dark blue bedsheets, and asked, \"Have you made any plans for this evening?\" Sapphire thought for a moment and shook her head. \"No, why?\" Her mother just said \"Well, we are picking someone up from the airport tonight, who is going to want to spend a lot of time with you these holidays. I think,\" she added, looking at the clock, \"you should be heading to school.\" Sapphire just smiled, hugged her mother goodbye, and headed off to school. As it was the second-to-last day of the year, there was a fair bit of leniency given to the students. No wearing uniform, and they were allowed to bring sweets to school, as long as they didn't go hyper. PAGE BREAK Sapphire had had a fantastic day, what with the dress rehearsal going so smoothy, and the backstage crew helping her in her harness at the right time. It was going to be like a real production, where the characters flew with the aid of wires and harnesses. However, it was now ten past seven in the evening, and she was very bored. She and her parents were waiting for a certain flight to land, and she had been told to not bring anything with her. \"Your patience will be well rewarded, Sapphire.\" They had told her with a grin, and had left their daughter to wonder who they were waiting for. It hadn't escaped her notice that they had taken the bigger car, with three rows of seats. As she carried on wondering, her mum suddenly glanced over her shoulder and spotted Sapphire's friend Katja standing right behind her, grinning and laden with suitcases. Sapphire had not noticed this, still wondering about the guest who was going to be spending a bit of time with her. Her mum, deciding on how best to brake the news, said conversationally, \"I'm really looking to your production tomorrow night.\" Sapphire smiled, just as a familiar voice pipped up, saying, \"Can I come too?\" The smile vanished from the girl's face, replaced by a huge grin as she turned around, seeing her best friend Katja behind her. \"SURPRISE!\" Her parents and guests shouted jovially, and Sapphire happily hugged her friend, saying, \"So, that's why you couldn't respond to my message. You were on a plane.\" \"That's right, my friend.\" Kat said, as Sapphire introduced herself to her friend's parents, before they all left, heading out of the airport and towards home.[Chapter 3] Do They Know It's Christmas? A.N. Well, I'm not going to write about Sapphire and Katja going to bed, as I'm sure you can imagine. So, the next day, whilst Kat was sleeping off a large amount of jet lag, Sapphire and all of her schoolmates were getting ready for their slightly different version of Charles Dicken's \"A Christmas Carol.\" I shall skip the dress rehearsal, and move on to the part just before Sapphire's character appears. Enjoy :) The part in italics is straight from the book \"A Christmas Carol,\" which I don't own in anyway. Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in! `I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.' Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. `The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley. Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this. I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees.' He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears. `They are not torn down.' cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms,' they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here - I am here - the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will be. I know they will.' As he said this, his ears happened to pick the sound of a female singing \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" in a pretty, light tone. At first, Scrooge thought that one of his neighbors had broken in, but as he moved towards his curtains, behind of which the singing was coming from, he realized that he did not recognize the voice. Pulling the curtains aside, he was amazed to see a fourth ghost, smiling at the lightning sky that signaled yet another day, and currently singing \"The First Noel.\" 'I say, hello dear ghost.' He said in a rather cheerful tone. The ghost turned from the window, her smile still fixed on her ruby red lips. 'Hello, Mr Scrooge.\" 'Mr Scrooge' smiled, before giving her a confused look, and asked, \"May I inquire as to what you are doing here? You see, Jacob Marley informed me of only three ghosts, not four.\" \"It was my idea, and I knew I needed to come. You see, I am The Ghost Of Understanding Christmas. If you knew, or remembered the true meaning of Christmas, and why we celebrate it, you probably wouldn't be a despicable person to work with.\" She said, her blue eyes narrowing, and a scowl on her face. Scrooge didn't know what to think, so he asked, \"Where are we going?\" The ghost didn't reply, but grabbed hold of Scrooge's arm, and pulled him out the window. She had sort of taken him to the past and present at the same time. In fact, she had taken him back to the week before, when one of his many employees, rich enough to send her only son, Nicholas, to school, had gone to her son's Christmas Pageant. 'Why are we here?\" Scrooge inquired, watching as adults filled into the hall, all sitting cross-legged on the floor. \"You shall see, Mr. Scrooge.\" She assured him, as one by one, children rose to sing Christmas songs. At long last, Nicholas and his classmates rose to sing a song called \"Christmas Love,\" the title seeming rather bold to Scrooge and a few others. He then noticed that thirteen children had pieces of paper, each with a letter, that would not doubt spell the name of the song. All was going well until a little girl called Mary, who had the \"M,\" unknowingly turned it over, so that it formed a \"W\" instead. Several students struggled to control their mirth, but Mary wasn't bothered in the slightest. Then, as the \"E\" was raised, a sudden hush fell over the crowd, and a few people gasped. For when they all read what was written, everyone, including Scrooge, knew why it was that they celebrated the holidays in the first place. It read: CHRIST WAS LOVE. This caused the narrator to say proudly, \"I believe He still is.\" This statement, in it's own turn, caused people in the audience to clap and cheer. Ten minutes later, they clapped and cheered again, as the entire cast came out for one last, final bow. PAGE BREAK \"You were amazing, Sapphire.\" Katja said brightly, as her friend joined her, needing to change out of her costume, which consisted of a wavy auburn wig, a cream-coloured dress and white heels. Katja knew that if she were forced to wear such an outfit, she'd probably throw a fit. But her friend looked rather pretty, and she told her so, just as another girl joined them, a nasty sneer on her face. She nodded to Kat with a smile, but her face contorted back into a sneer as she glanced at Sapphire. Sapphire looked up, and raised an eyebrow, before muttering \"You'd better not cause trouble, Chantelle.\" Then she smiled, and introduced her friend to her enemy, in an effort to be polite. \"Katja, this is Chantelle Houghton. Chantelle, this is my friend, Katja Kyparissia, from Greece.\" She said politely, before realising that she should change out of her costume, and into a special dress. Katja waved, and decided to chat to her mother, who had just come over to her. PAGE BREAK After the prizes and awards were given out, the headmistress walked onto the stage, and smiled at everyone. \"Well, what a year it has been. As most of you already know, at the start of the year, we decided to send some of our students away on holiday towards the end of the year. Well, we managed to make a substantial profit of $36,000.\" There was a lot of clapping at this, but this soon turned into cheering when the Headmistress explained that the money was really going to help the Ebola affected countries in Africa. The clapping went on for a solid three minutes, and the Headmistress added, \"So, this evening we have something very special, as some of our girls are going to sing Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" which is a song that changed the world.\" A group of around fifteen girls, Sapphire included, made their way onto the stage, all wearing dresses resembling Africa, and smiling as the music began to play. As they neared the big finale, all fifteen of them jumped up and down, quite throwing themselves into what they were doing. When they'd finished, they received a standing ovation, before they joined the rest of the school in singing \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas.\" When they'd finished that, too, there was the sound of a ringing bell. Everyone looked excited, and turned their attention to the back of the hall, where a man dressed as Santa Claus, came in with a grin on his face, a sack in his hand, and calling out, \"Merry Christmas!\" PAGE BREAK For some unknown reason, the Headmistress wanted Sapphire to stand at the very back of the line. Confused, Sapphire obeyed, and Katja, standing in front of her, pulled her into a conversation. \"Hmm, I think Santa's Irish,\" Sapphire mused with a smile; for she was rather fond of the Irish and Scottish accents. \"Really?\" Katja asked, noticing that she was behind Chantelle, to whom Santa was giving a paper bag of lollies. \"Yeah,\" Sapphire said, as her friend stood aside, to let Santa hand her... a beautifully wrapped Christmas present? \"Merry Christmas, young lady.\" Santa said, confusing her greatly. \"Is this really for me?\" She asked. Santa nodded, and handed her a card. \"You should leave the gift 'till Christmas Day, but I think the card should suffice 'till then.\" Sapphire opened the card, and gasped. There were autographs from several musical pop stars, including those of the boys from 1D, and... \"Sir Bob Geldof?\" \"Yes?\" Santa said, smiling at her. Sapphire looked at him puzzled for a moment, before her eyes widened in amazement. \"You're Sir Bob Geldof?\" She breathed, hardly daring to believe it. He nodded with a smile, and said, \"Indeed. Thank you for donating $36,000 to Ebola affected Africa.\" Both girls stared at him in utter astonishment, and Sapphire asked, \"How did you know about that?\" Sir Bob Geldof raised an eyebrow, and said in that fantastic accent of his, \"The story is known worldwide. It's on Facebook and Twitter, and not to mention, it's been in The Daily Telegraph, The Times, and all the newspapers in Ireland. Is there anything you want to ask me?\" \"Yes, how did you gt to be Santa, and why isn't there a huge media fuss over this?\" Sapphire asked, wondering why no one had gone over to bother them. \"I was asked to be Santa, and I agreed. Also, apart from a few people whom I trust, no one else knows that I'm here, with my girlfriend, for Christmas.\" He smiled, and said, \"Thanks again.\" \"You're welcome, and Merry Christmas.\" Sapphire said brightly, as he smiled and waved goodbye, before heading back to his hotel, whistling \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" cheerfully to himself. AN: Hope you enjoyed that :) Please review[Chapter 4] Christmas Eve AN: Sorry it's taken me a while to get this chapter up. So, in part of this chapter there is the lyrics for the song \"Fairytale of New York,\" originally sung by Shane MacGowan and Kirsty MacColl. So the words written like this is the male part, words written like this is the chorus, which they sing together, and words written like this is the female part. Hope you enjoy it. :) The next few days after Sapphire's Christmas production were filled with a manner of all things Summer and Christmas. Sapphire and Katja spent every waking hour ahead of them singing Christmas songs, putting up the tent, swimming, Christmas shopping, and eating a lot of ice cream and foods that are native, (for want of a better word) to New Zealand. \"You're so lucky to have such amazing weather at Christmas time. All I ever get is a biting cold wind.\" Katja said in an envious tone one afternoon, as she and Sapphire lay outside in the sun, sunbathing and drinking L&P.; Sapphire smiled over at her, looking just as envious as she said, \"Well, let's put your statement into account, shall we? You get to sunbathe on the 27th of July, whereas here, it's cold.\" \"That's your birthday, right?\" Katja asked, taking a sip of L&P;, before wondering why it was called that. \"Why is this drink called L&P;?\" \"It's an abbreviation. The \"L\" stands for lemon, and the \"P\" stands for Paeroa, which is the name of a town here.\" She said, taking a sip of her own, before adding, \"Yes, that is when my birthday is.\" Katja's mum came out just then to join them, with a glass of gin and tonic in her hand. \"Well, hello you two.\" She said smiling. \"Hi, mum.\" Kat said, before sitting up straight to examine her legs, which she attempting to tan. There was a fair brown colouring on them, making her smile as she reached for the sunblock. Then she suddenly screamed loudly, causing both her mother and her friend to jump in alarm. \"What's the matter?\" Sapphire asked, before yelling as well, as her Dad sprayed her with the garden hose. He chortled with derisive laughter, and his daughter eyed him angrily. Then she noticed that her dad was standing right beside another hose. With a slight smile, she jumped up, turned it on, and aimed at her father, laughing herself. He leapt backwards, and suddenly lost his footing as he plunged into the swimming pool, yelling out in shock as he did so. Sapphire yelled out to him, asking him if he was alright. He came back to the surface, whilst appearing to gurgle in a most unpleasant way. It turned out that he was laughing and shook his head, in an effort to get the water out of his ears. \"Run Sapphire, before I pick you up and throw you into the swimming pool.\" He said, his light brown eyes alight with mischief. Sapphire paled, and wasted no time in running away, her guests cheering her on with laughter. Her mum came out, wondering what on earth was going on. As she watched her husband and daughter running around, she smiled a fond smile, and cheered her husband on. Sapphire ran past her, her dad close behind. He was laughing as he managed to grab Sapphire's t-shirt, and lifted her up. \"Oh shit!\" She swore, knowing what would happen as she struggled to get out of her father's arms. His grip, however, was quite strong, and he threw her sideways into the pool, yelling, \"Now we're even.\" Katja couldn't help the laughter that came bubbling out of her mouth, and was in a fit of hysterical laughter. Sapphire, swimming back up to the surface, laughed too, as Katja's father and uncle joined them for lunch. PAGE BREAK After six whole days of Summer fun, it was now the afternoon of Christmas Eve. Katja's mother and Sapphire's mother had gone to do a last bit of shopping, and Sapphire and Katja were playing hide and seek. Katja was the one who was hiding, and she was currently sitting on the window sill of her friend's bathroom. Her legs were tucked up under her, and the curtain concealed her. Downstairs, she heard her friend yelling, \"Ready or not, here I come.\" Katja chuckled to herself, wondering how long it would take Sapphire to find her. After about ten minutes, she heard her coming into the bathroom, and looked around, before her blue eyes spotted the semi-closed curtain. \"Found you!\" She exclaimed triumphantly, as she heard her name being called by her mother. The two girls ran downstairs, and were instantly given a wrapped parcel. \"You'll wear these tonight. Katja, I bought you a silver one, because I didn't think that you would like the others that I saw.\" Kat paled somewhat, and muttered, \"Please tell me that you did not buy me a dress.\" She unwrapped the present, and looked at the silver dress in dismay. It was certainly nice enough, and Sapphire would have looked nice in it, but she had to wear it. Then she took a deep breath and smiled; it just wasn't worth it to be upset on Christmas Eve. \"Thank-you.\" She said, and hugged her mother. Sapphire did too, when she spotted that she had a gorgeous cream-colored dress. \"It's beautiful, Mum.\" She said, as Kat's father announced that dinner was ready. It consisted of a huge barbecue, complete with salad and potatoes. \"Don't eat all of the potatoes, and I'll fry them up to have with breakfast tomorrow.\" Sapphire's mum said, as the two friends sat together, eating succulent pieces of steak, juicy and covered in butter. After finished with eating, Katja forced a smile on her face as she picked up the silver dress that was hanging over a chair. \"Well, it's not pink, at any rate.\" She said, as she and Sapphire hurried upstairs to change. \"I'm sure your mother wouldn't be that cruel.\" Sapphire said with a smile, as she slipped the cream-colored dress on, along with the cute flats that her mother had found. PAGE BREAK Katja gasped as her brown eyes took in the magnificent decor of the church in which they were going to hear the Christmas Story and sing Christmas Carols. The entire room was covered in banners proclaiming different Christmas verses such as \"Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" There was also a Christmas tree, which was covered in what she was sure to be edible candy canes. Despite the dress, Katja was having so much fun with singing and dancing, and she secretly enjoyed the swishing sound her dress made when she move from side to side in sync with her friend. At the end of the singing and the telling of the Christmas Story, they all sang \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas,\" only she did it in Greek: \"Sas efchómaste Kalá Christoúgenna Sas efchómaste Kalá Christoúgenna Sas efchómaste Kalá Christoúgenna Kai kali chronia.\" \"Kalí eídisi férnoume Se sas kai tous syngeneís sas Sas efchómaste Kalá Christoúgenna Kai kali chronia.\" Sapphire smiled at her friend and felt a warm glow as she heard the familiar song in a foreign tongue. PAGE BREAK Sapphire smiled at her friend as they changed back into a t-shirt and shorts. \"I loved your singing, Kat.\" Kat smiled too, and the two of them made their way downstairs, listening for some hours to Christmas songs, including \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" \"Deck the Halls,\" \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas,\" \"Snoopy's Christmas,\" and a number of other songs. At twenty past nine, Sapphire's mum said, \"Ok, you two. You can both name a Christmas song to listen to, and then it's time for you two to go to bed.\" \"I'd like to hear that one that's sung in that really strange language.\" Kat said, and then added, \"I think it's in Swiss or German.\" \"O Tannenbaum?\" Her friend asked, and Kat nodded. \"Wouldn't you prefer to hear it in English?\" Sapphire's dad asked, and she nodded again. After playing the Boney M version of the song, Sapphire said, \"Well, dad. I think we should do our Christmas song.\" Her father raised an eyebrow, before smiling and saying, \"Very well then.\" \"You sing a Christmas song with your dad?\" Kat asked, as her friend stood up with a grin. \"We sure do, and we usually sing it together on the eighteenth.\" There was a sad look in her eyes as she muttered something that sounded like \"Poor Kirsty,\" making Kat wonder who Kirsty was. The sounds of piano music reached her ears a moment later as her friend's dad started singing: \"It was Christmas Eve, Babe In the drunk tank An old man said to me \"Won't see another one. And then he sang a song The rare old mountain dew I turned my face away And dreamed about you. Got on the lucky one Came in eighteen to one I got a feeling This year's for me and you So Happy Christmas I love you, Baby I can see a better time When all our dreams come true. Kat smiled at the lyrics, thinking that they were rather sweet. She watched as her friend spun around, undoubtedly making herself dizzy. They've got cars big as bars They've got rivers of gold But the wind goes right through you It's no place for the old When you first took my hand On a cold Christmas Eve You promised me Broadway was waiting for me You were handsome You were pretty Queen of New York City When the band finished playing They howled out for more Sinatra was swinging, All the drunks they were singing We kissed on a corner Then danced through the night The boys of the NYPD choir Were singing \"Galway Bay\" And the bells were ringing out For Christmas day Kat smiled warmly as she watched her friend being spun around by her dad, and felt that the song they were singing could become a favorite. However, when the two of them began insulting each other, she wasn't so sure. You're a bum You're a punk You're an old slut on junk Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed You scumbag, you maggot You cheap lousy faggot Happy Christmas your arse I pray God it's our last The boys of the NYPD choir Still singing \"Galway Bay\" And the bells were ringing out For Christmas day Even though it was only a Christmas song, Kat was quite shocked by the names her friend was seemingly taunting her father with. She only hoped that the last verse wasn't as rude, and to her relief, it wasn't. I could have been someone Well so could anyone You took my dreams from me When I first found you I kept them with me babe I put them with my own Can't make it all alone I've built my dreams around you The boys of the NYPD choir Still singing \"Galway Bay\" And the bells are ringing out For Christmas day PAGE BREAK When the song ended, Kat clapped and smiled, before wishing her parents a \"Good night, and see you on Christmas Day.\" Then the two of them headed outside to the tent, and Kat asked, \"So, who's Kirsty?\" Sapphire smiled sadly and said, \"She originally sang the female part of the song, and even did it live. Then she saved her son whilst on holiday in Mexico, who was in the path of a boat that shouldn't have been in the water, because that area was off limits to boats. Unfortunately, she was caught by the boat herself and was instantly killed.\" \"Oh.\" Kat said sadly, as she ducked into the tent and her sleeping bag. \"Good night, Sapphire.\" She said, as Sapphire did the same. \"Good night, Kat. See you on Christmas Day.\" Almost two and a quarter hours had passed when both girls woke up, feeling extremely cold, as if it was winter instead of Summer. \"What on earth?\" Kat mumbled, her voice thick with sleep. Sapphire was rubbing her eyes and her arms in an effort to be warm. \"I second that.\" Her friend muttered, and unzipped the tent. Instantly, her hand was covered in snow. \"What on earth is going on? It's snowing outside, in the middle of Summer!\" Then both girls heard the sound of a train, and looked at each other, bewildered. Crawling out of the tent, they watched in utter astonishment as an Express Train pulled up not far from where they were standing. However, that wasn't as astonishing as what they saw written on the train : The Polar Express. AN: And that's how we get into the world of The Polar Express. Will we get on board? Hope you like it.[Chapter 5] All Aboard! AN: Yay! My fifth chapter, and here's were we get into the swing of things! Enjoy! Previously: Almost two and a quarter hours had passed when both girls woke up, feeling extremely cold, as if it was winter instead of Summer. \"What on earth?\" Kat mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

Crawling out of the tent, they watched in utter astonishment as an Express Train pulled up not far from where they were standing. However, that wasn't as astonishing as what they saw written on the train : The Polar Express. \"WHAT!?\" Kat yelled, her voice echoing somewhat. Sapphire glared angrily at her. \"Shut up, Kat!\" She hissed quietly. Kat looked at her friend in surprise, and asked, \"Why?\" \"Because, it's five minutes to midnight, and most people, even children, are asleep by that time.\" \"Don't worry about that. Are you two coming to the North Pole?\" Both girls turned to see the conductor, same as ever, looking at them expectantly. After a moment, the two of them whooped for joy, and hopped onto the train. With a fond, but exasperated smile, the conductor waved his lantern out the window, signalling to the driver to carry on. Meanwhile, Kat and Sapphire had grabbed the front seat, and then glanced around. There was no one else on the train, and they sat back to enjoy their ride. PAGE BREAK Neither Katja nor Sapphire could understand how the train was able to get from New Zealand to Australia, and then to America. Was there a special train track that connected the three parts of the world together? Although Sapphire knew it was possible to catch a train from somewhere in Europe to somewhere in Asia, it was only because a few countries, mostly Russia, were in both parts of the world. All this thinking was giving her a slight headache, so she stopped thinking about it, and instead, she smiled as the other kids boardered the train. They let the Know-It-All-Boy, whose name was Luke, to sit with them, and against all odds, they got on rather well. Luke asked them questions about Greece and New Zealand, whereas they asked him questions about America. \"Have either of you been to America?\" He asked, and both of them shook their heads. \"Not actually been there for a holiday, but I will one day.\" Sapphire said, smiling to herself, just as the conductor came around, asking for their tickets. \"Tickets please,\" he called grandly, waving his ticket puncher around. Luke and Katja found their's relatively quickly, but Sapphire was at a loss as to where her's could be. She then glanced down in slight frustration, and was most astonished to find her ticket half concealed by her bum. With a laugh, she pulled out the golden ticket from it's strange hiding place, and handed it to the conductor, who had just finished punching Luke's. \"Thank you, Mam.\" He said, and a shower of golden circles tumbled from the ticket as he punched it. When he handed back to her, she saw a \"C\" at one end, and an \"E\" at the other. \"Look what the wise guy punched on mine,\" said Luke, sounding, if anything, annoyed. \"L\" and an \"E.\" \"What the heck is that supposed to mean?\" Sapphire shrugged, and looked at her friend's ticket which read \"BE.\" Then the train slowed down to pick up the last passenger; a sad, little lonely boy called Billy. AN: There you go, yet another chapter for you, Kat. Hope you enjoy it :)[Chapter 6] Billy AN: I shall do my absolute best to get this story finished by Wednesday next week. If not, it may not be finished until New Years. On that note, I shall stop writing this, and write the chapter. Sapphire shrugged, and looked at her friend's ticket which read \"BE.\" Then the train slowed down to pick up the last passenger; a sad, little lonely boy called Billy. At that very moment, Sapphire tapped her friend's shoulder, muttering discretely, \"We should go sit in the other carriage, whilst the train's stationary.\" Katja nodded, and the two of them just about bolted down the walkway of the train, to the carriage behind them. They had no sooner sat down, when the train began to pick up speed, and the little boy outside began to run. They heard \"Hero Boy\" calling to him to hurry, and about a minute or so later, both girls nearly fell to the ground as he applied the emergency brake. They looked up in time to see Billy jumping in to their carriage, after glancing into the adjacent one. Sapphire smiled warmly at him, and Katja did the same. Billy looked at them in dismay; he had been sure that there would be no one else in there to bully him, which he had had quite a bit of. With a sigh, he sat down, and muttered \"Hello.\" \"Hello, I'm Sapphire, and this is my friend Katja. What's your name?\" She, of course, knew what his name was, but it would have looked strange if she had greeted him by name. \"I'm Billy.\" He said quietly. \"Nice to meet you, Billy.\" Kat said, and held out her hand to shake his. He looked at it as if she were offering a lollipop, which she would then snatch from him. Hesitantly, he offered her his hand, and shook it. \"So, Billy, are you looking forward to Christmas tomorrow?\" Sapphire asked, and in answer, Billy looked away, a sad, gloomy expression on his face as he shook his head. \"Christmas never works out for me. I always lose family members, and I live with my oldest cousin, who keeps blaming me for the deaths of my family.\" Katja and Sapphire both looked aghast, and although they didn't have much experience in being blamed for the deaths of family members, even they knew it was horrible. \"Maybe things will get better, Billy.\" Sapphire said, as the door opened to reveal the \"Hero Girl\" and the Conductor, with a mug of hot chocolate. \"Oh, I wondered where you girls had got to,\" the Conductor said, and with a sudden snap of his fingers, two cups of hot chocolate appeared out of nowhere. As they sipped hot chocolate, and Billy's ticket was punched, Sapphire had no idea that her statement about things getting better for Billy would come true. AN: And that's a wrap for now. Enjoy :)[Chapter 7] F and Y? Disclaimer: No, I don't own anything. Previously: As they sipped hot chocolate, and Billy's ticket was punched, Sapphire had no idea that her statement about things getting better for Billy would come true. When The Conductor and the \"Hero Girl\" who had introduced herself as Sophie, left, the two girls eyed Billy's ticket curiously. \"What does your ticket say?\" Kat asked, showing him hers. \"\"F\" on one end, and a \"Y\" on the other end.\" He said, seemingly more cheerful, just as the door opened again, and the Conductor and Sophie came back in. The Conductor was leading a very worried Sophie by the shoulder, and Sapphire mouthed, \"He's not going to throw you off the train,\" as they passed by. Sophie suddenly looked very relieved, and allowed herself a small smile as she was led out into the bitter, freezing cold. Sapphire smiled too, before pondering the \"F\" and \"Y\" on Billy's ticket. In the film, it had been different variations on the meaning of the word trust. She could only think of one word that could be on his ticket, and that word was family. AN: The shortest chapter of any story. I will update it again very soon.[Chapter 8] The Hobo AN: Yes, I am very well aware that Christmas is long over, but I thought I'd update it anyway. Enjoy, and you can think of the chapter being a belated Christmas present, or a very, very early one. :) Sapphire smiled too, before pondering the \"F\" and \"Y\" on Billy's ticket. In the film, it had been different variations on the meaning of the word trust. She could only think of one word that could be on his ticket, and that word was family. \"I wonder why it's going to say \"Family,\"\" she mused quietly to herself as the \"Hero Boy\" came running in, breathless, and asked where Sophie was. \"We'll come with you,\" Sapphire said, and Kat also agreed, before they looked at Billy and asked him to come along as well. For the first time since he climbed into their compartment he smiled and shook his head. \"No, I'll be alright. But if I do get really lonely, I'll sit in the other compartment.\" They smiled at him, before heading out into the freezing cold. After some awkward moments of climbing the ladder outside our compartment, the wind and snow in our faces, and the Hero Boy's attempt to hang on to Sophie's ticket, their eyes suddenly adjusted to a light from which they could either see the Hobo, or the conductor with Sophie. \"Hey!\" The Hero Boy yelled, before yelling \"Hey!\" Again, followed by \"I find your ticket. Wait!\" They hurried after them, losing them both in the flurry of snow. As their feet crunched over the snow, following the footprints, they noticed another light, and the two girls grinned, knowing that it would be the ghostly hobo. He was muttering \"Good King Wenceslas,\" as they drew level with him, but stopped in order to say \"Is there something I can do for you three?\" Hesitantly, the boy said, \"I'm looking for a girl,\" which caused the hobo to laugh. \"Well, there's two right beside ya,\" he said, causing them to laugh, and Sapphire chuckled, \"Not like that.\" By way of explanation, the boy said, \"I have her ticket,\" which caused the hobo to take an interest. \"Well, would ya look at that? What is this?\" Sapphire was about to answer, when he said, \"This is an official, authentic, genuine ticket to ride. I'd put that in a safe place, young man.\" As he was about to put it in his pocket, the hobo said something about keeping his valuables in his shoes, not that he any need for a ticket. Katja and Sapphire looked at each knowingly: of course he didn't. Being a ghost, he was, of course, able to ride the train any time he wanted to, before he then said, \"I own this train, you know. It's like I'm it's king. In fact, I'm the king of the NORTH POLE!\" His last two words sort of echoed around, causing Sapphire to say, rather defiantly, \"No, you're not, Santa is.\" The hobo laughed again, placed a Santa hat on his head, and said, \"You mean this guy?\" Before he chuckled just like Santa. Once he'd stopped laughing, he said, \"Where are my manners? Do sit down, and let me offer you a mug of Joe.\" As they did so, sitting on two boxes, Sapphire asked the Hero Boy what his name was. \"Oh, it's Chris.\" he said. As they drank their coffee, the hobo and Chris had a short discussion about Santa, before he put the fire out, and said \"Seeing is believing, am I right?\" Chris had a hesitant look on his face as he asked, \"We are really going to the North Pole, aren't we?\" The hobo laughed, and said, \"Aren't we?\" In a mocking sort of way. \"Are you saying that this is just a dream?\" He asked, now looking hopelessly lost. Of course it wasn't a dream, not for him, anyway, and Sapphire and Katja were willing to bet that when their journey on the amazingly cool train was over, there'd be some kind of evidence to suggest that it was real. \"You said it, kid. Not me.\" The hobo said, downing the last of his coffee, before making a rather good suggestion of finding Sophie. Then he turned to them, and asked, \"Oh, by the way, do any of you believe in ghosts?\" The two girls nodded, but Chris, staring at them incredulously, shook his head. \"Interesting.\" The hobo said, before leaving them behind. Almost instantly, Chris threw himself into the snow, but the girls immediately pulled him up again. Within minutes, the hobo was back, yelling at Chris to wake up, 'cause there was no sleepwalking on his train. As he said something about jumping them knuckles, and flipping Chris onto his shoulders, two other ghostly figures appeared out of nowhere, and offered the girls a ride on their shoulders. They were both relieved, as neither of them fancied walking in the snow. \"We've got to make it to the hog.\" The hobo carrying Chris said. \"The what?\" All three teenagers or pre-teens asked. \"The engine, you tenderfeet.\" He said, as one of the others explained a little further, \"We have to make it to the engine before we reach Flat Top Tunnel.\" Sapphire and Katja instantly knew why that was important, as Chris asked why. \"Because, young man, there is but one inch of clearance between the roof of this rattler and Flat Top Tunnel. Savvy?\" The two girls flinched; it must have a very painful death for him to endure. They then glanced at the other ghosts, and wondered what kind of tragic end they had met. With precise control of their skis, the ghosts jumped over the tops of carriages, until they had reached the engine, telling them to jump inside at the right time. They vanished and the other three leapt right on top of a bunch of coal. AN: Yet another chapter done and dusted. I was watching the movie, and apart from a few things, that's pretty much the gist of it.[Chapter 9] Caribou Crossing AN: Yes, the second chapter today :) Enjoy, as there will probably be more. Previously: With precise control of their skis, the ghosts jumped over the tops of carriages, until they had reached the engine, telling them to jump inside at the right time. They vanished and the other three leapt right on top of a bunch of coal. All three of them slid down the bunch of coal, and once they were standing, Sapphire attacked the soot that had clung to her pajamas. Then they headed towards the engine itself, and much to Chris's surprise, but the girls knew who'd be there, was Sophie, driving the train. \"I thought you were thrown off, and you're driving the train!?\" Chris said, incredulously. \"They put me in charge.\" She said cheerfully, and then added, \"The engineer had to check the light.\" A faint wail from far away reached Sapphire's ears, and she chuckled, knowing that one of the engineers was about to fall off, and had grabbed the other guys long hair. \"How do you know what to do?\" Chris asked her, and she smiled again. \"It's quite easy, I'll show you.\" She pointed to a big lever and said, \"That's the throttle.\" She then pointed to a small one, and said, \"That's the brakes.\" She then pointed to the pressure gauges, and then said, with another smile, \"That rope is the whistle.\" \"The whistle?\" Chris repeated, and she nodded. \"Wanna try it out?\" He didn't need to answer as the big grin on his face said , \"Yes, I will.\" With that, he yanked on it, and said, \"I've wanted to do that my whole life.\" Outside, at the front, the engineers had managed to fix the light, and then noticed that there was something odd about the tracks. Realizing the predicament they were in, the engineer yelled towards the engine, \"STOP THE TRAIN!\" As loudly as possible. The three girls and Chris glanced towards the man, and his instructions became clear. \"We have to stop the train.\" Sapphire said, and asked Sophie \"Which one did you say was the brake?\" Sophie pointed, and Sapphire slammed it backwards. Fortunately, it was the right one. However, their celebration was short-lived as the conductor yelled out, \"There can be no Christmas without the Polar Express arriving on time. Am I the only one who understands that?\" He was half way through telling Chris off, having once already stopped the train, when Sophie pointed, and said, \"But look!\" He hurried over to the window, and then shouted, \"Caribou Crossing?!\" Sapphire and Katja also headed to the window, and spotted several reindeer-like animals on the tracks. \"It's going to take some time before they clear this.\" Muttered one of the engineers. Just then, Katja slid over, and instinctively grabbed the nearest thing, which was the very long red hair of the other engineer. He yelled in a way that was remarkably similar to the way Caribou sound. As though he had been speaking to them, the Caribou responded with their own noise, and slowly moved back. Getting the gist of it, the Conductor pulled the man's hair, and each time the poor guy yelled, the Caribou moved back. As they moved away, the Conductor said, \"Well, problem solved. All ahead, slowly.\" The engineers listened, and within moments, the Caribou had vanished. AN: Hope you enjoyed that :)[Chapter 10] Ice Frozen Over The Tracks Previously: As they moved away, the Conductor said, \"Well, problem solved. All ahead, slowly.\" The engineers listened, and within moments, the Caribou had vanished. As the four teenagers grinned at the sight of the caribou leaving, the engineer and the coal man noticed they were going too fast, and attempted to slow down. Their efforts were for naught, and Chris said, with an edge of worry in his tone, \"We're going pretty fast.\" The Conductor nodded in agreement, and turning to Sapphire, said, \"Tell the engineer to slow down.\" She faced towards the engine, yelling as loudly as possible in the wintery wind to \"Slow down!\" \"Watch the speed!\" The engineer was doing his best, when all of a sudden, the cotter pin sheared off. \"The what just sheared off?\" Asked the coal man. \"The pin, over there.\" He yelled, pointing down at the ground, just as the pin slipped through a crack, causing both of them to say, \"Oh no!\" Meanwhile, Sapphire reported to the Conductor that they couldn't hear her. \"They can't?\" The conductor asked, as the train came to the top of a hill. \"I don't like the look of this,\" he said, as they passed signs saying, \"Danger, 179 degrees grade,\" the other saying, \"Use low gear.\" \"Quick, under the safety bar!\" He said sharply, and all five of them stood there. \"Is everything ok? What do we do?\" Chris asked. \"Well, considering the fact that we've lost communication with the engineer, currently standing exposed on the front of the locomotive, which appears to be accelerating uncontrollably,\" he began, fixing a safety belt to the front, \"Not to mention, rapidly approaching Glacier Gulch, which just happens to be the steepest downhill grade in the world, I suggest we all hold on... TIGHTLY!\" He yelled the last word as the train zipped down Glacier Gulch at an uncontrollable speed, the others also screaming. It was like a roller coaster ride at an amusement park, but much more dangerous. \"Are we going to die!?\" Kat screamed at Sapphire, who shouted back, \"I sincerely hope not!\" Once their roller coaster ride was over, they had another problem to deal with. The ice had frozen over the tracks. Inside the engine, the pin had come flying out of the crack, and the engineer had swallowed it. Beginning to choke, the other guy helped him out by smacking him over the head with a hammer, only to have the pin to come flying out and dislodging itself in the icy, frozen sea. Meanwhile, the train was sliding around on the ice, and Sophie was nearly thrown off. The conductor grabbed her, and the others pulled him back. Sapphire, standing at the back, felt someone pulling her back, and she turned to see the Hobo, who pulled them all up, before disappearing. \"Well, you three, quick thinking on your part. Some adventure, yes?\" They nodded in agreement. Back in the engine, the coal man pulled off his cap and pulled the pin from his very long hair, fixing it into place. Finally, the train rightened itself, and came to a complete stop. The conductor, more pleased, said, \"Well, that's more like it.\" His expression became stern however, as he headed towards the engine and demanded to know what on earth was going on. He looked up to the sound of cracking ice, which was rapidly cracking towards the train, causing the Conductor to yell, \"Get us the blazes out of here!\" After some time, once tracks had been spotted, and the Conductor gave directions, the train was soon on its way to the North Pole. AN: More to come :)[Chapter 11] The Conductor's Story Previously : After some time, once tracks had been spotted, and the Conductor had given directions, the train was soon on its way to the North Pole. Whilst the train had been going the way the Conductor said, the ticket from Chris's slipper flew into the air, at which Sophie cried out, \"You're going to lose your ticket.\" Chris suddenly remembered that he'd stuck Sophie's ticket in there, and said, \"It's not mine, it's your's!\" Sophie suddenly looked really excited, as she said, \"It's mine?\" \"Yes.\" Chris said, making a grab for it. The three girls joined in, and once they had caught it, they noticed that the carriages were beginning to submerge in water. \"Brace yourselves!\" Yelled the Conductor, as they finally got onto the tracks. \"Well, that's more like it.\" He said, satisfied. Sophie was very grateful as she hugged the others, saying, \"Thank you so much. I can't believe you found my ticket.\" \"Did someone say \"they found a ticket?\"\" asked the Conductor, and they nodded. \"Well then, tickets please.\" Sophie handed it to him, and he punched it a few times before giving it back. \"LE\" Chris said. \"Just like Luke.\" Kat said, and then clarified at the other's blank looks, \"the know-it-all kid.\" As the train made it's way up a mountain, the girls and Chris made their way across the top, the Conductor telling them to watch their step. \"Rather tricky walking up here,\" he said, then, as Sapphire and Chris slid, he added, \"What did I tell ya?\" Then he told them a little story. \"Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run, I was up on the roof making my rounds when I slipped on the ice myself. I reached out for a hand iron, but it broke off. I slid and fell. And yet, I didn't fall from the train.\" \"Someone saved you.\" Sophie said. \"Or something.\" The Conductor said, a mysterious note to his tone. \"An angel?\" Kat inquired. \"Perhaps.\" The Conductor said, jumping down into the nearest compartment. \"Hang on,\" Chris called. \"What did he look like? Did you see him?\" \"No Sir. But sometimes seeing is believing. And sometimes, the most real things in the world are the things we can't see.\" He said, helping the girls down. Then he headed into a room that was filled with abandoned toys. Sapphire specially, wanted to cry at their misfortunes. She may have been fourteen, but she had a great number of barbie dolls and stuffed toys, all of which she loved to pieces. Kat also looked at the toys sadly, before following Sapphire back into the main compartment. As they headed off to find Billy, Luke ambushed them, telling them about things that had happened, and which they already knew. Basically ignoring him, they spotted Chris a little way ahead of them, heading towards Billy's compartment. AN: Still more and more to come. My writing skills are on fire this evening.[Chapter 12] When Christmas Comes To Town AN: I don't own this sweet song. All I own is my imagination and Sapphire. Enjoy :) Previously: Basically ignoring him, they spotted Chris a little way ahead of them, heading towards Billy's compartment. Hearing Billy singing softly to himself, they drew level with him, but they approached, Sophie put a finger to her lips, and opened the door a little, the sound of Billy's voice floating towards them. \"I'm wishing on a star And trying to believe That even though it's far He'll find me Christmas Eve I guess that Santa's busy Cause he's never come around I think of him When Christmas comes to town.\" Sapphire smiled gently, thinking to herself as Sophie walked up behind Billy, and sang, making him jump. \"The best time of the year When everyone comes home With all this Christmas Cheer It's hard to be alone.\" Kat joined in, as well. \"Putting up the Christmas Tree With friends who come around It's So much fun When Christmas come to town.\" Sapphire smiled again, and sang too. \"Presents for the children Wrapped In red and green All the things I've heard about But never really seen No one will be sleeping on the night of Christmas Eve Hoping Santa's on his way.\" \"When Santa's sleigh bells ring I listen all around The Herald Angels Sing I never heard a sound And all the dreams of children Once lost, will all be found I all I want when Christmas Comes to town That's all I want when Christmas comes... to town.\" Then as they all looked up, they saw an astonishing and beautiful sight. The sky was lit with colour, and Chris exclaimed, \"The Northern Lights.\" AN: I've partially seen the Southern Lights, and they are incredible. Just then, the Conductor came out and said, \"Hey, you five. We just crossed it. Latitude 66 degrees 33'. The Arctic Circle. And do you see? Those lights in the distance. They look like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.\" Kat and Sapphire could hardly wait for him to say what they knew he would say next. \"There,\" he said, before pausing for dramatic effect, \"Is the North Pole.\" AN: Probably another two more chapters tonight. My brain is telling me to write.[Chapter 13] The North Pole Part 1 Previously: Just then, the Conductor came out and said, \"Hey, you five. We just crossed it. Latitude 66 degrees 33'. The Arctic Circle. And do you see? Those lights in the distance. They look like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.\" Kat and Sapphire could hardly wait for him to say what they knew he would say next. \"There,\" he said, before pausing for dramatic effect, \"Is the North Pole.\" Once he had uttered those fantastic words, Katja and Sapphire looked eagerly towards the city that was the North Pole, and the reason for their traveling all the way from their word into the world of the Polar Express. \"We're nearly there, Sapphire,\" she murmured, and looping her arm through that of her friend's, they headed back into the train, singing the wonderful song about the Polar Express. \"It's a magic carpet on a rail That never takes a rest Flying through the mountains and the snow You can ride for free and join the fun if you just say \"Yes\" 'Cause that's the way things happen on the Polar Express Whoo-whoo, the whistle blows That's the sound of her singing Ding, ding the bell will ring Golly, look at her go. You wonder if you'll get there soon, Anybody's guess 'Cause that's the way things happen on the Polar Express. When we get there, we'll scream \"Yay!\" We'll arrive with a bang, bang, bang Boom, boom, boom, laughing all the way As they sang, the delighted Conductor cried out, \"We made it, with five minutes to spare. We made it.\" He then headed back inside, just as Sophie said, \"There should be elves. Where are they?\" \"More than likely,\" Sapphire said, \"They're in the center of the city.\" The Conductor nodded, and added, \"That is where Santa will give the First Gift of Christmas.\" Luke eagerly asked, \"Who gets the First Gift of Christmas?\" The Conductor raised an eyebrow, and said, \"He will choose one of you.\" Just then, Katja spotted elves out of the corner of her eye, marching to the beat of \"O Tannenbaum,\" which everyone eagerly watched. The Polar Express was slowing down, and finally stopped. Katja and Sapphire looked at each other eagerly. This was another of their favorite scenes: in this one, Chris accidentally knocked the front of the train from the back, eventually ending up in Santa's Sack of presents. \"I think we should go with them,\" Kat said, referring to the others who got caught in Santa's Sack. Sapphire looked somewhat skeptical. \"Remember that bridge they had to cross?\" She asked. Kat sighed, as they got off with the others. But then, she and Sapphire decided to go with Sophie, Chris, and Billy. Surely, they'd find a safer alternative, and if not, they could probably balance their way across. Page Break They hurried back to persuade Billy to come with them, but he firmly stated, that even though they had been nothing but kind to him, Christmas had never worked out for him, so he wasn't going. Just then, the train shook, and when Chris opened the door, the rest of the train was rolling away. To make matters worse, their compartment started moving backwards. And just when it seemed everything was going to be fine, the track switcher changed, sending them on the wrong path. There was no break to be found, of course, but that didn't matter, 'cause they were soon heading into a tunnel. A minute after that, they found themselves spinning around for some time, before the train carriage finally stopped. The familiar tune of \"Winter Wonderland\" made Sapphire cringe; it had never been her favorite Christmas song. Then she gulped nervously, as there was no way out but by crossing those bridges. Determined to not look down, she gingerly went first, slowly but surely moving, often asking the others if they were okay. After some frightening minutes, everyone had made it across, and were racing towards the tunnel. As they raced out of it, they heard a record of \"Silver Bells,\" which seemed to stick on the \"ring-a-ling bit.\" They heard the sounds of bells, and followed Sophie into a room filled with elves, telephones, and images of sleeping children. An elf came by to say that the last present had been finished, and had been wrapped in candy-striped red with a number seven Holly-green bow. \"A number seven bow? When we're this close to lift off?\" An elf asked. \"What are they thinking down there? Are they meshuggener? Where's it heading?\" \"To the United States. Grand Rapids, Michigan.\" Chris softly exclaimed that he was from Grand Rapids, but Sapphire and Katja both knew that he wasn't the only one among them from Grand Rapids. Suddenly, the red \"Naughty\" button began to flash, causing one elf to exclaim, \"That's all we need on our busiest night. What's his 20?\" \"Apparently, some kid from Maple, New Jersey stuck some chewing gum in his sister's hair.\" One elf said. The same elf wondered if he was the same kid who stuck a tack under his teacher's chair the year before. It wasn't. \"So, do we alert the Big Man? Does it mean that he gets nothing for Christmas? The kid was then called, saying \"I didn't do it.\" One elf relented, saying that was almost Christmas, and to be on the safe side, put him on the check twice list for the following Christmas. Then they shut everything down, and climbed aboard the pneumatic, knowing it was the fastest way to get to the square on time. \"And time is money.\" Said the chief elf. \"Let's go,\" Sophie whispered, as they waited for the elves to leave. AN: I would love to write more, but even good authors need sleep. So goodnight from me, and there will be more chapters tomorrow, and that's a promise.[Chapter 14] The North Pole- Part 2 Previously: Then they shut everything down, and climbed aboard the pneumatic, knowing it was the fastest way to get to the square on time. \"And time is money.\" Said the chief elf. \"Let's go,\" Sophie whispered, as they waited for the elves to leave. The elves climbed into the pneumatic, and were off with a zing. Katja eyed the pneumatic somewhat worriedly. \"There probably won't be enough room for all of us.\" She whispered to Sapphire, who nodded in agreement. Turning to the others, she said, \"Listen. We'll get in the one after you, please stay where you are.\" The other three nodded in agreement, and were off with a zing. Sapphire and Katja climbed into the next pneumatic, and as they took off, it took them through the city, much like a ride in space before it stopped. The other three were waiting patiently there for them, and Sapphire remarked, \"Some ride, huh?\" The sounds of \"It's Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas\" reached their ears, and far below them was a very long conveyor belt, no doubt there to escort every single present in the world to Santa's Sack. Chris glanced down at the arrows which were pointing in a straight direction, and said that they should probably follow them. This they did, until they reached a tunnel. Once out of it, there seemed to be no way to get out. \"We're going to miss everything,\" Sophie muttered, but just then, there was a loud blaring sound, the conveyor belt moved, causing them to get off, and a present fell onto it. Chris eyed it eagerly, and exclaimed, \"It's going to my town. To someone named Billy.\" Billy pipped up, \"That's my name.\" When Sophie said the address, Billy said, \"That's my address.\" As the present passed by, Billy eyed it, and then jumped onto the belt. The other four did the same, and found themselves on the hugest slide they had ever seen, going up and down, before beginning to spiral in the same way that water is drained from a bathtub. Billy was hanging into the present tightly, as they all fell right on top of the huge bag of presents. Billy exclaimed over the present in his hands. When Sophie said that it read \"Merry Christmas Billy, from Mr C,\" Sapphire couldn't help but laugh. \"What's so funny?\" Kat asked, and Sapphire smiled. \"My English teacher is called Mr C.\" she explained. Billy, after giving it a shake, and saying that he wanted one of these his whole life, was prepared to open it. Sophie stopped him, and pointed to another label that read, \"Do not open till Christmas.\" Billy looked so sad, but as Chris pointed out, those were the rules. They were then pulled along on a large trolley that was moving backwards, before they were directly underneath a canvas tent which had a huge hole in it. They all looked at each other before there was a sound of fireworks being set off. They were so busy watching the ropes above them that none of them noticed that the sack was being lifted up and around the presents. The sack, which was connected to some flying machine in the sky, was lifted right up out of the hole, and was carried right over the majestic city, all the way to the square. As they looked at the majestic sights coming their way, Billy suddenly gave a yell, and fell. The three girls and Chris took hold of him, and managed to pull him up, as well as Luke. \"Whatever are you doing here?\" Sapphire asked sharply. \"Same as you. I came to check my presents and all I got was some stupid underwear.\" Sapphire rolled her eyes, and suddenly couldn't wait for him to find out what his ticket said. Suddenly, Chris said \"Look\" and pointed to an astonishing sight. A ginormous Christmas Tree was shining gold in the center of the city, and it looked utterly beautiful. A golden star shone from the top, and a voice from above them called, \"You may start your descent any time now, at your convenience of course.\" Four elves took some of the air out the large balloons that supported them, making a farting sound, and causing Sapphire and Katja to snigger uncontrollably. Sophie suddenly said cheerfully, \"It's still five to, I think we're gonna make it.\" Luke scoffed, and said, \"What gives? It's been five to for the last hour. We've got time to kill.\" Chris said that he didn't think they were going to make it, as the Conductor called out below, \"I may just be an old railroader, and know nothing about lighter-than-air craft, but from my layman's perspective, you need more altitude.\" The crowd below chorused, \"More altitude!\" The same voice above called, \"Altitude please, a bit more altitude please.\" Some of the elves floated down to the ground, and the bag was lifted high into the air. The Conductor said the elves were called \"The Flying Elves.\" He also said they were specialists, and they were never to try that at home. As Chris said again that they weren't going to make it, the bag knocked the star off the tree, which fell to the ground, striking an elf on the side of his nose, before flying back to the top of the tree, relieving him. \"A well-oiled machine.\" The Conductor said, sounding very pleased, as the sack was placed on Santa's Sleigh. Just then, a couple of elves peered in, and said, \"Alright you stowaways, party's over.\" Luke looked a little nervous, and bluttered out, \"I was just following them.\" Sapphire, Kat, and Chris echoed in unison, \"We fell in here by mistake.\" One of the elves reassured them. \"Forget about it. We knew you were in there the whole time.\" \"So, we're not in trouble?\" Kat asked. \"No, don't worry about it. Although, we may want to make sure that you don't do things like stowawaying next year.\" The elf said. \"Is that even a real word?\" Kat asked, before the elf said, \"Alright, time to get down.\" Sapphire and Katja climbed out first, slid down the sack, and then ended up doing somersaults, to great amounts of applause. \"Well, hello again.\" The Conductor said, before greeting the other kids. Once Billy had finally handed his present back to the elf, it was placed in the sack, and the string was tied around it. AN: Another long chapter for you all. And no, there is no such word as \"stowawaying.\"[Chapter 15] Santa And Tickets Previously: \"Well, hello again.\" The Conductor said, before greeting the other kids. Once Billy had finally handed his present back to the elf, it was placed in the sack, and the string was tied around it. Once the rope had been tightened, there was a loud fanfare, and a great deal of cheering. The elves began singing a song called \"The Spirit of the Season.\" There were more fanfares, and the elves held up strings of bells. When they shook them, the most beautiful sound filled the air. For a moment, Sapphire and Katja saw Chris smile, before the smile slid right from his face. He couldn't, as they knew, hear the bell, 'cause he still didn't believe. Sophie wasn't very helpful, as she asked cheerfully, \"Aren't those bells the most beautiful sound?\" They were, but not if you couldn't hear them. The bells were harnessed to the reindeer, and Chris looked more and more distressed. There came another fanfare, followed by a moment of silence, followed by everybody singing \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.\" Just then, an entrance to the square lit up brightly, and the shadow of Santa Claus could be clearly seen. Sapphire and Katja jumped up and down, waving with the others, and grinned at each other. Their second journey into worlds not their own was simply incredible. As Bing Crosby's \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,\" Sophie said excitedly, \"He's here.\" They nodded excitedly, as elves climbed on top of each other's shoulders, to wave at their boss. Chris was desperately trying to see him, but had no luck, until one of the bells suddenly flew off, and the music slowed down. As he picked up the bell, Sapphire watched him say desperately, \"I believe,\" and looked astonished and pleased when the bell ring clearly in his ear. Sapphire noticed Santa's reflection in the bell, and then did Chris. \"What was that you said?\" Santa inquired. \"I, I believe.\" Said Chris, before something occurred to him, and he held out the bell, saying, \"I believe this is yours.\" \"Well, thank you.\" Santa said, grateful. Just then, Luke became rather annoying, as he asked to have the first gift of Christmas. Santa nodded, and said, \"Young man, patience. And a touch of humility might also serve you well.\" Luke looked chastised, and muttered \"Yes Sir.\" Causing Sapphire and Kat to laugh. Santa glanced over at them, and whispered, \"Welcome to the North Pole, and keep on imagining.\" They looked thoroughly pleased, and thanked him. He told Sophie that she was a lady of decision, Christmas spirit, and to keep up the good work. He then told Billy that there was no greater gift than friendship, before inviting Chris to have the first gift of Christmas. They all saw him receive the bell, but only the girls knew that it had been placed in the pocket with the hole. As he came back to join them, Santa flew around them, and amidst the cheering, Sophie said, \"It's everything I dreamed it would be.\" Billy glanced over at Chris, and asked if it could all just be a dream. As Chris reassured him, Sapphire and Kat glanced at each other, and sincerely hoped it wasn't. Finally, Santa cracked his whip, and the Christmas Tree in the square lit up as he flew around it and went to deliver presents. When he had gone, and the dust from Santa's whip had vanished, the elves cried, \"Yippee!\" Probably because it was officially Christmas Day. They then danced around, and some placed the back of the train on. Once the elves had placed the back of the train on again, it was time for them to find out what the tickets said. When the Conductor got to Luke, the boy handed him his ticket, and away went the ticket puncher. When it was handed back, Luke's expression was perplexed. \"Lean? Whatever that's supposed to mean.\" \"Probably means you need to eat lean meat.\" Sapphire, who was two people behind him, said. Kat, right behind him, laughed appreciatively.\" \"Perhaps, but \"lean\" is spelt with four letters. I believe I punched five,\" the Conductor said, showing him again. \"Hey! Are you saying I don't know how to?\" Luke began, indignantly, taking the ticket from the man. Then his expression cleared, and said, \"Oh, it says \"Learn.\" My mistake,\" he said, as he climbed onto the train. \"Lesson learned.\" The Conductor said, as Kat handed him hers. \"Thank you, Ma'am.\" He said punching it, and handed it back to her. Like Luke before her, Kat also looked perplexed when she saw what was on her ticket: BELIEVE \"But I already do.\" She said, looking to the Conductor for confirmation, who handed her another ticket, and said, \"Sometimes, they refer to the future.\" Kat climbed into the compartment with the other kids, and sat down to look at the other ticket. She'd only just looked down, when she heard a bout of laughter from outside. Looking out the window, she was surprised to see Sapphire chuckling, said, \"I will do,\" and went to sit next to her friend, still chuckling. \"What's so funny?\" Kat asked, and Sapphire handed her her ticket. CONSENTRATE was the word punched into it, and she asked, \"What's that other ticket?\" \"The Conductor said that sometimes they refer to the future.\" Kat said, and looked down at the ticket, which said CONDUCTOR. \"He got this ticket,\" she said thoughtfully, as Billy came and asked if he could sit with them. \"Sure thing.\" Kat said, and the two girls moved over to let him sit with them. As Sapphire had guessed earlier, his ticket said FAMILY. \"It's what I really need,\" he said, as Chris walked in, the kids clambering around him, asking him to show them the bell. When they discovered it was missing, they offered to help him find it, but as the train left the square, it was too late. Kat and Sapphire knew he'd find it that morning, but they felt sorry for him all the same. Page Break Having dropped off everyone else, the Conductor was nearly ready to head back home to rest. But first, he had to drop two girls not of his world, off. When they arrived back in Wellington, the girls woke up, and asked, \"What did Billy's ticket mean?\" The Conductor smiled, and said that Santa, being the magical person he was, was able to turn back the clock, and give Billy his whole family back. \"That would make anybody's Christmas,\" Sapphire mused, and the Conductor smiled again. \"Indeed, and speaking of which, it's time you left and had Christmas in your world.\" They nodded, wished him a \"Merry Christmas,\" and headed back to the tent in the freezing cold, wondering if there would be a sign that they had been on the Polar Express. AN: And that's the end of the Polar Express. However, it is by no means the end of the story. And the bit about the Conductor's ticket comes from the story \"The Magic Inside the Polar Express.\"[Chapter 16] Christmas Day AN: The sixteenth chapter of Katja and Sapphire on the Polar Express. Enjoy, it's \"Christmas Day.\" Well, in the story, at least. :) Sunshine flooded the streets of Silverstream, the flowers waking in its brilliance, and if one listened carefully enough, they would hear the delighted cries of adults and young children alike. They would think that several people were having a large party of some kind, and they wouldn't be wrong. For that certain day was one that everybody looked forward to for sometime: Christmas Day. The sun's beams had just reached a pale green tent, and warmed the inside, not to mention it's occupants. Sapphire Stone's closed eyes began to flutter under her long lashes, and the warm sunshine woke her up. She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, and yawned. She smiled thoughtfully as she recalled her wonderful dream; she and Katja had caught the Polar Express and had gone to the North Pole, meeting Santa Claus, and then had caught the train back. Speaking of Katja, Sapphire's eyes flicked from the ceiling to her friend, and her eyes widened in astonishment, as she was lying in a strange position. Somehow, durring the night, she had ended up by the tent's entrance, with her left knee tucked under her chin, and her right leg was lying across Sapphire's sleeping bag. Her head was lying on top of her left arm, and her right arm was drapped across her chest. Sapphire then leaned towards her, and poked the tip of Katja's nose. She then burst out laughing when the girl, still asleep, sat up and sneezed. Taking her chance, Sapphire yelled, \"BLESS YOU!\" causing Katja to jump, and opened her chocolate brown eyes. \"What did you say?\" She asked sleepily. \"I said \"bless you,\" 'cause you sneezed when I poked your nose.\" Sapphire said, and Katja gave a sleepy laugh. Then her eyes widened, and she said, \"OMG, Sapphy!\" \"What?\" Sapphire asked, wondering if something had startled her friend. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" Kat yelled jovially, and both friends embraced one another warmly. \"Merry Christmas to you, too.\" Sapphire said warmly, before her eyes lightened, and she said, \"Let's go wake up our parents.\" Hurriedly, they dashed out of the tent, and raced inside. Sapphire ran into her parent's room, and leapt right on top of her mum. \"Wake up, Mum! It's Christmas!\" In the spare bedroom, Katja was doing the exact same thing, and five minutes later, the six of them were opening their Santa stockings. There were chocolate bars, and costume jewelry, coke, socks, perfume, and in Sapphire and Katja's stockings, there was a novelized dramatization of the Polar Express. The two girls stared at the books, and then at each other. When they opened the book, they spotted their tickets: CONCENTRATE and BELIEVE. \"Maybe it wasn't a dream,\" Sapphire said quietly to herself as she took a bite from her Moro bar, looking thoughtful. Katja was also looking thoughtful, but they were soon pulled out of their thoughts when Sapphire's dad turned on the Christmas radio station, and Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" began to play. As Sapphire's mum and Katja's mum cheerfully began to make breakfast, the two friends danced around to the happy music that filled the air. Some five minutes later, Katja's uncle came around, and gave his niece a hug. \"Merry Christmas, sweetheart.\" He said warmly, and added, \"You looked absolutely gorgeous in that silver dress last night.\" Katja smiled, before helping Sapphire set the table for seven. Aside from the cutlery, and the condiments, there was also bottles of orange juice, and two bottles of alcohol, one called Bailey's, the other called Crème De Menthe. The teenagers eyed the other two bottles, wondering what kind of alcohol they were. Seeing their puzzled looks, the adults informed them that Bailey's was a chocolate liqueur, and Crème De Menthe was a peppermint one. \"Perhaps later on, you girls could try the two together, but in the meantime, there's juice, coke, lemonade, LLB, and grapefruit juice.\" Kat looked confused as she swallowed a rasher of bacon. \"LLB?\" \"Lemon, Lime, and Bitters.\" Sapphire clarified with a smile as the adults finished their breakfast, knowing that it was time to open presents. AN: Another chapter finished :) Please R & R.[Chapter 17] All But One Present AN: Chapter 17, and I hope you enjoy it Previously: Kat looked confused as she swallowed a rasher of bacon. \"LLB?\" \"Lemon, lime, and bitters,\" Sapphire clarified with a smile as the adults finished their breakfast, knowing that it was time to open presents. Sapphire's father smiled warmly at them all, before plonking himself beside the tree, ready to hand out the presents. There was quite a lot more than usual, as Katja, her parents, and her uncle had bought all their presents to the one house, and it looked amazing. Colours of red, green, silver, purple, and gold sprinkled the bottom of the tree, as Sapphire's father, Andreas, picked up the first present and read, \"To Kat, a very Merry Christmas from Sapphire, X.\" Kat smiled at her friend, and with a pleased \"Thank-you, Mr. Stone,\" began to tear into the wrapping to reveal a beautiful leather photo album, filled with photos of their two months together when she'd been an exchange student. \"Sapphire, this is so thoughtful of you. I haven't got many photos of the two of us.\" She said, giving her friend a hug. \"You're welcome,\" Sapphire said cheerfully, and was even more so when her present from Katja was revealed to be \"The Emperor's Code\" and \"Storm Warning.\" \"I was looking through your books when you were at school, and decided on those two.\" Kat said, and was treated to a hug from Sapphire. \"Thanks, I appreciate that.\" She said, and the morning carried on in the same manner. Kat's parents had given her the full set of Harry Potter books, her uncle had given her a dark blue t-shirt which, in silver writing, read \"Dear Santa, define good,\" and Sapphire's parents, at a loss of what to get her, had bought a large box and filled it with the kinds of things that can only be acquired in New Zealand. It included things like Pineapple Lumps, L&P;, a calendar with different kiwi icons, pencils with little kiwis on them, a NZ icon colouring book, sheep-shaped erasers who were wearing backpacks with sharpeners inside, and a green t-shirt with a map of New Zealand on it. \"That's so nice,\" Kat said happily, and shook Andreas's hand, and hugged Ariana. Sapphire's parents had given their daughter a recipe book, her grandparents had given her a nail kit, her aunt in England had sent her a gorgeous photo of the Christmas Tree in Trafalgar Square, her cousins had sent biscuits with Christmas-related shapes, and Sir Bob Geldof had given her a copy of his Autobiography \"Is That It?\" signed, as well as Pink Floyd's The Wall film. \"Thanks, Sir Geldof,\" she murmured, pleased as punch. Her parents smiled as well, as they recalled the thoughtfulness of their daughter's school. PAGE BREAK Ariana got a beautiful pair of authentic cowgirl boots from her husband, a stetson and a $30 book voucher for Paper Plus from her daughter, her parents-in-law had given her three bottles of Pinot Gris, as well as a $50 gift voucher for a manicure at a day spa in Wellington, and her good friend Claire had given her a nail kit. Andreas's wife and daughter had both given him $50 vouchers; his wife had given him a voucher for itunes, and Sapphire had given him one for Jb Hi-Fi, a store in which movies and music is sold. His parents had given him three bottles of Pinot Gris, and his sister had given him an autobiography about Roger Waters, lead singer of one of his favorite English rock bands, Pink Floyd. Kat's parents were given a hamper of NZ treats from the Stone family, movie passes from Kat's uncle, and t-shirts from their daughter. Kat's uncle had been given Pinot Noir from the Stone's, fine cheeses and biscuits from Katja, and a photo album from his sister and brother-in-law. AN: So, I had fun writing that. Hope you enjoy reading it, and if you want to know about anything, like what something is, or why I've given certain people their names, ask away, and I'll only be too happy to answer your questions :) TTFN, my lovely fans :)[Chapter 18] Surprises AN: This chapter has a few. Also, I wish to finish this story soon, because I want to start my next one soon. Previously: Kat's parents were given a hamper of NZ treats from the Stone family, movie passes from Kat's uncle, and t-shirts from their daughter. Kat's uncle had been given Pinot Noir from the Stone's, fine cheeses and biscuits from Katja, and a photo album from his sister and brother-in-law. Kat and Sapphire smiled at the mess of paper, ribbons, and tape strewn all over the living room floor, and offered to help clean it up. \"That's kind of you girls, but something tells me that we've missed a couple of presents.\" Ariana said, smiling at their offering to help, and looking in confusion at a couple of envelopes right at the back of the tree. Sapphire got down on all fours, and slid her way under the tree, causing Katja to laugh at her movements. A moment later, Sapphire wiggled her way out from under the tree, holding the envelopes in her hand. When she looked more closely at them, one of them had her name on it, the other had the names of her parents. Handing the one with her parents name on it to her parents, she opened the one with her name on it. It was a Christmas present of sorts from Katja's parents, a note saying that they were going to get new next-door neighbors soon. \"New next-door neighbors?\" Sapphire asked, raising an eyebrow. \"How did you know?\" \"Well, we know your new next-door neighbors.\" Katja's mum said, sharing a wink with her husband and daughter. \"Really?\" Sapphire's mum asked, then inquired, with her daughter obviously on her mind, \"Do they have children?\" \"Oh, yes, they certainly do.\" Katja said, smiling like an idiot. \"Who are they?\" Sapphire asked, at the same time her father asked, \"Do we know them?\" \"Yes, you do know them, because they are us.\" All three Kyparissia's chorused as one. None of the Stone's had been quite expecting that response, and while her parents could only gape, Sapphire stuttered, \"Why?\" \"Well, my uncle is the only one in our family living in New Zealand, but even the rest of our family are residing in certain parts of Australia.\" Katja's tone had taken on a harsh note when she had said Australia, and Sapphire, remembering from their conversations that she wasn't overly keen on the idea of the continent, nodded in understanding. \"Makes sense, I suppose,\" Sapphire said, before suddenly hugging her friend, and said jovially, \"Welcome to New Zealand.\" Kat thought for a moment, before she said, \"Cheers, mate,\" causing Sapphire to laugh. \"Well, if one is to live in New Zealand, one may as well use it's colloquialisms.\" Kat said, and as they tied up, Sapphire asked, \"So, when do your things arrive?\" \"In three days, the 28th.\" She said, gathering all her things together, and asked, \"In the meantime, can I put my things in your room?\" \"Sure thing, and just so you know, I still go to the same school as I did when I met you for the first time.\" Sapphire said. \"But the building in which you performed that play didn't look like your school.\" Kat said, as they ascended the stairs. \"No, because that was the town hall.\" Sapphire explained as they walked into her room, before she stopped suddenly, causing Katja to nearly crash into her. \"What's the matter, Sapphy?\" \"My wall's swirling, in the same way it did when we went to the 39 Clues world.\" Sapphire said, walking further in, allowing Katja to come into the room and see that her friend was right. \"Well,\" she said, putting down all of her Christmas presents by the bookcase on the eastern wall, \"aren't we blessed with fandom magic this Christmas season.\" Sapphire looked a little perplexed, and raised her eyebrow again. Then she let out a cry of astonishment as two envelopes came hurtling out of the wall, one a navy blue, the other a blood red. The two friends looked at each other in astonishment, and then looked with perplexity at the envelopes and the wall from which they had just emerged from. \"Well, I wonder where we will end up this time,\" Sapphire said, picking up the envelopes with one hand, and looped her free arm through Katja's as they stepped through the portal once again.[Chapter 19] Merry Christmas AN: Another chapter in one day! I know, but I do want to get this story finished. I already have an idea for my 2016 Christmas Story, (freaky, I know) and want to finish this one and let it rest. There's probably another five chapters tops to go, hope you enjoy this one. Previously: The two friends looked at each other in astonishment, and then looked with perplexity at the envelopes and the wall from which they had just emerged from. \"Well, I wonder where we will end up this time,\" Sapphire said, picking up the envelopes with one hand, and looped her free arm through Katja's as they stepped through the portal once again. After once again experiencing that odd sucking feeling one gets when they've walked into a portal, Sapphire and Katja looked around at the room in which they found themselves in. The room, obviously a living room, was decorated in the cheery golds, reds, greens, and silvers of Christmas. There was a six foot Christmas Tree, decorated with images of Father Christmas, snowflakes, angels with gold halos, bells, baubles, and even presents. Music, which they recognized to be \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" was playing in the background, but as they listened carefully, and realized what language it was being sung in, the two girls felt certain they must be in St. Petersburg, Russia. As they took another look around, they realized that their guess was right, for even though it had been nearly two years since they had seen this place last by their own worlds time, they recognized the photos on the walls, and saw that some new ones had been added. \"This is Irina's place,\" Sapphire whispered, and as if on cue, the door which she knew led to the kitchen, opened and a fair-haired, arctic blue-eyed, middle-aged woman wearing winter pajamas with Father Christmas on them, strolled purposefully into the room. When she spotted Sapphire and Katja, it took her less than a second for her to recognize them. Her stern-looking face split into a wide smile, and she threw her arms around them in a joyous way. \"Merry Christmas, my любимцев!\" She cried, using the Russian term for darlings. \"Merry Christmas, Rini!\" They chorused, using the nickname that they had used out of the blue one day during the Clue Hunt, and she had found it rather sweet at the time, but she had also tried not to smile. \"I think Christmas is so magical,\" Irina said happily, as she led the two girls over to the balcony, where the city lay blanketed in a thick sheet of snow. Twinkling lights could be seen here and there, and the girls had to agree that it was a magical time. However, as she turned away, Sapphire spotted something on Irina's left index finger, and knew that this Christmas was going to be very magical for her. \"A certain Ekat popped the question, did he?\" Sapphire asked with a cheeky grin, as she realized what those envelopes could have contained. Katja gasped, and spun around, her brown eyes widening as they took in the amethysts and diamonds in the ring on her finger. \"OMG! Irina, are you getting married!?\" She exclaimed, a huge grin breaking across her face. \"Da, on New Year's Eve, and nyet, I'm not marrying Alistair. I don't care if you ship me with him in your \"Fanfictions.\"\" \"Then who?\" Sapphire asked. \"Well, a man I believed to be dead for several years, forced to live in exile in Tibet, until I found and recognized him two weeks ago whilst traveling around near Mount Everest.\" She said with another smile, and the door opened again to reveal a dark-haired, blue-eyed man smiling at all three of them. \"May I introduce you? Katja, Sapphire, I'd like you to meet Nivalona Spasky, my husband, and soon-to-be-married-again husband?\" The two girls gaped in astonishment, and then cheered loudly for their friend, happy that she had her family back.[Chapter 20] Bridesmaids AN: I really need to knuckle down and get \"Katja and Sapphire on the Polar Express\" finished, so there will be a lot of the story uploaded for the next hour or so. I'm going to make something up about modern Russian weddings, but I reckon it'll be fun. Enjoy! Previously: The two girls gaped in astonishment, and then cheered loudly for their friend, happy that she had her family back . Once they had stopped cheering like crazy, they shook hands with Nivalona, and told him that they were so grateful that he was alive. Then they mentally slapped themselves, as they realised just how creepy and peculiar that must've sounded. Fortunately, Nivalona had a good sense of humor, and laughed it off. He then turned to his wife and said, \"Darling, how about you ask the girls what you wanted to ask them.\" Irina nodded, warmth shining from her arctic blue eyes, as she said, \"Nataliya is going to be my Matron of Honor, would you like to be my bridesmaids?\" Sapphire considered this for a moment, thinking that the ex-spy had left it quite close to time, and then, with a warm smile she said, \"Well, as long as the portal works on New Years Eve, I see no reason why we couldn't attend. Don't you think you're cutting it quite close, though?\" Irina laughed, and said, \"I'm not thick, Sapphire. I have two other bridesmaids coming as well.\" At their confused look, Irina explained that at Russian weddings there were four bridesmaids, two of which everybody knew or knew of, and the other two were known by the bride herself. \"Nivalona doesn't have a problem with it, either, as it's been that way since 1956, I believe.\" \"Well, that's an interesting idea for a wedding,\" Sapphire said, laughing at the idea, noticing that when she had finished laughing, the wall began to swirl again. \"I would also love to come,\" Katja said, grinning happily, before asking, \"What colour dress should I wear?\" \"Silver or midnight blue, as that's our colour scheme.\" Irina said smiling, and added, \"Be prepared to dance the night away, as well.\" \"Oh, we will,\" they chorused, before wishing the two of them a Happy Christmas, and as they began to fall through the portal, the last thing they heard Irina say was, \"Let's wake up Nikolai.\" AN: More chapters on the way.[Chapter 21] Christmas Day to New Years Eve When they had gotten back from visiting Irina, and discovering that her husband was still alive, they just smiled at each other for a moment, before heading back downstairs and listening to \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" Sapphire dancing as they did so. \"You know, I think this has been my best Christmas ever.\" She said to Katja, who found herself agreeing with her friend. After all , she thought, it isn't every day one gets to meet a celebrity, ride for real on a fictitious train, find out that a close friend is moving next door, and step through portals in order to be invited to a wedding. Yes, she couldn't think of a better way to spend Christmas. \"Anybody fancy a swim?\" Sapphire's mum asked, and, what with the boiling hot weather, everyone agreed. They swam and dived for coins to their hearts content, singing along to Christmas songs, and topping up their drinks when need be. When lunchtime came, nobody felt like going inside to eat, so all the food and drinks were laid out on a long table in a gazebo, and they helped themselves. There was lots of cold meats, such as chicken, ham, turkey, as well as bread rolls, mini cheeses, crackers to go with cheese, marinated cabbage, coke, L&P;, Lemonade, mashed potatoes, honeyed carrots, truffles, crackers for pulling, fancy cheeses, fruit mince pies, mince bites, nuts, a box of cadbury favourites, and a box of assorted biscuits. Katja stared in amazement at all the foods laid out before her, not sure what to get first. Eventually, she helped herself to chicken, a mini cheese, mashed potatoes, a bread roll, a mince pie, some nuts, and some honeyed carrots. As she sprinkled salt over her lunch, Kat looked up with a smile, and said, \"Thanks ever so much for inviting us.\" \"You're quite welcome,\" Sapphire's mum said, smiling. After lunch, however, everybody was feeling rather drowsy, especially the grown-ups, who'd been drinking alcohol. So, whilst the grown-ups had a snooze, Katja and Sapphire thought they'd play board games that afternoon, talking about other Christmases that had been and gone. PAGE BREAK The rest of the day was spent doing swimming, eating if they felt hungry, and in the case of the teenagers, trying little shots of baileys with creme de menthe. On the 26th, they decided to go into the city for the boxing day sales and swim at H2O Extreme, laughing at the thrill and excitement of going down the hydro slides. Whilst looking at the sales, Kat bought herself a blood red and black duvet, with matching sheets, and a bedside table. They had been to see the house next door, and Katja had already picked the room she wanted, happy to see that it came with an en suite, and a room big enough to be a study or a library, just for her. Her parents obviously had a bigger room, bathroom, and study, and then there was the kitchen, dinning room, another big room which they planned on making a library for books, CD's, and films, a sitting room, laundry room, and the garage. As she looked around, Kat commented that if they were ever to play hide and seek, it would take ages for her to be found. PAGE BREAK On the 27th, Sapphire and Katja didn't see each other for the whole day, as Sapphire had been invited to a friend's Bat Mitzvah in the city, and Katja had a room to make her own. However, as they were leaving, Katja glanced out of her bedroom window to see Sapphire wearing a knee-length yellow dress, white tights, and a necklace with the Star of David on it. On the 28th, 29th, and 30th of December, they spent those days pulling down the Christmas Tree, and putting away all the decorations and albums. They also swam, played in the park, and even went out for dinner and saw The Wizard of Oz at the St James Theater. On the morning of the 31st, Katja and Sapphire found their dresses that they wanted to wear, as well as anything else they might want, and at quarter to two, the wedding being at quarter past three, they headed back through the swirling wall, ready to end the year with a bang. AN: Nearly finished :)[Chapter 22] The Wedding Previously: On the morning of the 31st, Katja and Sapphire found their dresses that they wanted to wear, as well as anything else they might want, and at quarter to two, the wedding being at quarter past three, they headed back through the swirling wall, ready to end the year with a bang. As they reached their destination, the living room of Irina's house, they found themselves in a scene of busy things going on, but not chaos. \"Hi ya,\" called a friendly, American accent. The two girls looked up, astonished, to see Amy Cahill, whose long red hair was done up in a fancy bun, with curls cascading down either side of her face. She was wearing a dress of Christmas tree green, and sweet silver flats to match. Around her neck was Grace's jade necklace, and there were a pair of emerald earrings dangling down. \"Hello, Amy. Did Irina invite you?\" Sapphire asked, and Kat thought it sounded like a rather strange question, because, if Irina hadn't, then Amy wouldn't have been there. \"Well, yes, she did. She's got a lot nicer since the Clue Hunt.\" Amy said, smiling. \"Lucky, who else is coming?\" Kat asked. \"Well, there's Nataliya, the Kabras, Dan, and uncle Alistair.\" She said, eyeing the girls dresses approvingly. \"You look really nice, by the way.\" \"Thanks, where's Nellie and Fiske?\" Sapphire asked, wondering if the Cahills had come on their own. \"I don't know,\" said Amy. \"They received invitations as well, but ever since they did, I haven't seen them.\" She then led them into another room, where Natalie was getting her make-up done. She looked up as the artist carefully placed false eyelashes over her real ones. \"Well, if it isn't the two other peasants of the Clue Hunt.\" She said, her ruby lips pursed. \"Just because we can't afford dresses made from Gucci, silk, tulle, or anything else that's expensive, doesn't mean you can insult us.\" Kat and Sapphire chorused in unison, just as Natalie and Amy began to laugh. \"I'm just playing a little joke on you; I'm nothing like my mother anymore.\" She said smiling, and adding, \"You look lovely.\" Sapphire and Kat laughed, thanked the British girl, and sat down to get their make-up done, which had been kindly arranged in advance by Irina. \"Where is Irina, by the way?\" Amy asked, looking around. \"Getting dressed,\" came a familiar Russian accent, and they looked up to see Nataliya wearing an outfit of pale blue, including her makeup, apart from her lips, which were an icy pink. \"You look lovely,\" Natalie said smiling. \"I concur, but isn't the colour scheme midnight blue and silver?\" Kat asked. \"Well, yes it is, but we can wear whatever colour we wish.\" Nataliya said smiling. PAGE BREAK At twenty to three, Sapphire had just been wondering where Irina was, when she saw her and gasped. Irina was practically floating down the stairs, a dress of midnight blue reaching to her ankles, and matching heels on her feet. Attached to the dress was a silver sash, with swirling Russian letters and numbers woven into it. Her make-up had the same scheme; subtle blue and red on her face, and her nails painted silver. A smile graced her face as she spotted the two girls, and they could see why Irina had once been called beautiful. It was as if, when her family had come back, so had her youth. She was accompanied by a little boy and girl, who were twins, and they were holding the hands of a red-haired woman. \"This is Sophie, who is the daughter of my dear friend Anna.\" Then, with a smile towards the two children she said, \"These are Sophie's children, Alexandria and Demitrivich.\" The little girl was wearing a dress the colour of ginger, a basket of dark blue rose petals clasped gracefully in her hands. Her brother was wearing an elegant tux, and he was obviously the ring bearer. Nataliya glanced towards the clock, now reading ten to three, and stated that they should be heading on their way. The others agreed, so they headed off towards the procession of cars that awaited them, ready to renew a special part of Irina's life. PAGE BREAK The wedding was utterly beautiful. Like some weddings, Irina's was done in a church. However, unlike other weddings, the church was nearly fully encased in darkness, were it not for the luminous sparkling lights overhead, floor lighting, and glow-in-the-dark balloons. There was also the sound of waves crashing on a beach, real sand on the ground, and a very large luminous moon. That way, there was plenty of light, but in the way one might experience at a beach, at nighttime, and a full-lit moon. As Irina and Nivolona said their vows, in English, which everybody had learnt, Sapphire couldn't help but cry, a warm smile on her face. She deserves to be happy, and the room is beautiful. If I were to take a guess at the theme, I'd say it was \"A moonlit wedding on a beach.\" She thought, smiling even wider as Irina and her husband embraced each other warmly, and applauding along with everyone else. PAGE BREAK Once the wedding ceremony was over, they were led outside into a glorious garden, and posed for several photos. Nikolai was there, smiling with his left arm around his mother's waist, and looking very happy. As for the mystery of Nellie and Fiske, well, they were there too, wishing to surprise Amy and Dan. After the photos were done, they mingled around for half an hour, getting to know Irina's friends and family. Alistair Oh was delighted to have been invited, and it surprised the girls that Irina's father had given her away. Irina herself was delighted with how well everything had gone, but she said thoughtfully, \"If only my brother's could have been here.\" AN: Only two or three chapters left.[Chapter 23] Let's Start the New Year Right AN: I own nothing that you recognise, neither do I own Ivan, Irina's brother, as he was created by my friend Katja. The name of this chapter comes from a song sung by Bing Crosby, and I hope you enjoy it. Please review, as that will make me feel much better. Previously: Irina herself was delighted with how well everything had gone, but she said thoughtfully, \"If only my brothers could have been here.\" She then turned to chat to Sapphire, who was enjoying a glass of orange juice nearby. \"Did you enjoy the ceremony, Sapphire?\" She inquired, and she smiled warmly. \"Oh, it was absolutely beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and guessed that the theme was \"A moonlit wedding on a beach.\" Irina nodded with a warm smile. \"You're absolutely right about that, and you look very lovely in your blue dress.\" \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Spaskya, you look ravishing yourself.\" Irina's eyes twinkled, and she gave the girl a hug. \"So, are your brothers joining us?\" She asked, and Irina's smile vanished, and she sighed unhappily. \"If only they could. But no, they are on official business in Austria. Don't ask me what it is, for they wouldn't tell me,\" she added as Sapphire opened her mouth to speak. Chastened somewhat by the brides tone, Sapphire took a sip of her orange juice, and then her brow furrowed as Irina moved away to talk to Anna. She wasn't annoyed with Irina, but she was perplexed about the sudden buzzing sound that had filled the air. She spotted Katja talking to Amy and walked over to her. \"Do you hear that buzzing sound?\" She asked, and both girls stopped talking and tilted their heads to the sky. Instantly, they heard the noise, but it wasn't so much a buzzing sound, but more a whirring sound. Thoroughly confused, they looked up further and gasped in astonishment as they spotted a familiar aircraft, the name of which would make one think that it was a boat of some kind. And rightly so, as it was called \"The Shark.\" But it was an aircraft, simply painted to look like a terrifying black shark. By now, no one was talking. They were all staring at the familiar aircraft, and Nataliya smiled broadly. As the shark came into land, two middle-aged men climbed out, a small crate in the hands of the younger one. They both had hair the colour of corn, blue eyes the colour of the sea, and wearing tuxedos. Irina let out a delighted cry, and ran towards her brothers, laughing for joy. \"You made it!\" She cried happily, throwing her arms around them. \"Of course, Irina. We wouldn't miss your special day for all the world.\" Alek told her cheerfully, and, upon taking the crate from Ivan, he opened it, and placed a small box into his sister's hands. Curious, she opened the box and then let out a cry of delight again. Just before Nikolai was born, and shortly after she'd gotten married the first time round, she and Nivalona had gone to Austria for a holiday. Whilst there, she had had a precious necklace, an amethyst locket with a picture of her mother, stolen. Now, somehow, her brothers had tracked it down and had given back to her. PAGE BREAK There were stories exchanged about Irina and Nivalona, some had them howling with laughter, others had them making slashing movements across their throats. After the stories were over, dinner was served. It consisted of either caviar or a delicious steak, smothered in garlic butter, and mashed potato. Sapphire, having never tried caviar before, but not wishing to waste it either, went for the steak instead. Katja also opted for the steak, as well. Nikolai, Anna, and Nataliya, on the other hand, went for the caviar, as did Irina and Nivalona. \"This steak is utterly gorgeous, Irina. Good work on your choice of caterers.\" \"Oh, Spaciba Sapphire, and you're absolutely welcome.\" They talked for a bit longer about Christmas and what their plans were for the following year. \"I'll be doing EFES, of course,\" Katja said, and everybody, Sapphire included, looked baffled. \"What's EFES?\" Anna asked. \"English For Exchange Students,\" Katja explained, causing Sapphire to look slightly confused. Kat raised an eyebrow, and asked, \"What didn't you understand?\" \"Well, your English is good for someone who doesn't speak it as their first language. Heck, you write well in English.\" Katja smiled, and said, \"While that is true, I do want to learn it until I can speak it fluently.\" \"Fair enough, I know you can do it,\" Sapphire said smiling, as the wedding cake was brought out. \"Hehe, that reminds me of a joke,\" Sapphire said and was emplored by the others to tell it. \"I attended such an emotional wedding once that even the cake was in tiers.\" She said, and everybody chuckled. It was a good joke, they thought, as Irina and Nivalona stood up and had several photos taken as they stabbed the knife into the first tier. There were four tiers in all: a chocolate, white chocolate, vanilla, and red velvet. There was also ice cream and cream to go with it. PAGE BREAK After another hour of mingling and socialising, the bride and her father were ready to do their dance. Sapphire recognised it as \"Once Upon A December\" from Anastasia. It was in Russian, which had to be one of the most lovely versions of that song she had ever heard. She heard someone sniff behind her and turned to see Nataliya standing behind her, tears coming down her face. \"I've always liked that song, even if I wasn't a child when \"Anastasia\" came out.\" When their dance was over, and the clock struck nine, everybody knew that there were three hours left of the year. Without knowing why, they all cheered, and for the next two hours and fifty-nine minutes, they dance away to a number of songs, which included YMCA, Don't Stop Me Now, We Will Rock You, Happy, Summer of '69, Grease Lightning, Summer Nights, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Time Warp, Moves Like Jagger, Let's Get It Started, Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia, Party Rock Anthem, Night Fever, and Pour Some Sugar on Me. When they'd stopped dancing, they all could see that there were but ten seconds left. \"TEN!\" \"NINE!\" \"EIGHT!\" \"SEVEN!\" \"SIX!\" \"FIVE!\" \"FOUR!\" \"THREE!\" \"TWO!\" \"ONE!\" \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" They all choroused delightedly, before they all joined together in singing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" PAGE BREAK After singing that song, everybody was feeling rather knackered to do anything but crawl into a bed and sleep. Irina had organised for her family and bridesmaids to stay at a nice hotel not too far away. In the morning, Sapphire and Katja, waking up first, saw that the wall in their bedroom was swirling. They left a short note to Irina, thanking her for her kind invite, and to explain that they had gone home. With that, they left that world behind for some time to come, not sure when they'd be back. Once back in their world, Katja watched as the wall stopped swirling around, and said, \"I thoroughly enjoyed both times we went there.\" Sapphire nodded in agreement, just as her mother walked in. \"You two have been quiet,\" she remarked, and the two girls smiled at her. \"It's not a bad thing, mum.\" Sapphire said cheerfully, accepting the pile of washing in her mother's arms. \"Yes, well, I hope you two are ready to dance the night away till midnight.\" She said, and they were. PAGE BREAK It wasn't long, however, before there was but a minute and a half to go till their new year. \"It's been a nice year,\" Sapphire said smiling thoughtfully. \"I quite agree, and Christmas certainly was special.\" Katja said. \"Are you ready to chant?\" Kat's mum asked, and once again, they counted back from ten, and bellowed out for the second time, \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" AN: So, after seven months, this story has come to an end. Thanks to those of you who followed, reviewed, and favourited it. Well, it's time to lay old ghosts to rest as they say, and enjoy it for all time, completed. ","Summary":" An Odd Poem A.N. Hi there, and welcome to the first chapter of my 58th story. My good friend Kat, f"},{"Movie":"Polar Express","Title":"The Return Express","Author":"ElphieThroppDG28","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4712591","Passage":"[Chapter 1] THE POLAR EXPRESS 2: THE RETURN EXPRESS Hey, everyone. It's me again, and...OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOO!!! EDMUND I LOVE YOU!!!! WAIT--er...sorry…I'm watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (the Disney version) right now…and Edmund just got stabbed by the White Witch!!!! That part always has me on edge. But then, like, Peter totally beats down on her, and then more cool stuff happens. Oh, and I don't have a huge crush on Skandar Keynes or anything...just think he's hot. Anyway, y'all are probably tired of my randomness and are curious about this story and what it's about. And I'm the one who can tell you all that! So, like, this is a Polar Express sequel/moviefic. It takes place when Hero Boy (I read online somewhere the people who made the movie dubbed him \"Chris\", so that's what we will call him) is grown up with a family of his own. And, of course, one of his kids has to inherit the whole I-don't-believe-in-Christmas-or-Santa-Claus-all-that-is-just-a-bunch-of-lies jean. However, on Christmas Eve night, the Polar Express comes to her house and the conductor takes her back to the night her father rode the same train, and she learns a thing or two about believing in the true magic of Christmas. DISCLAIMER: I OWN NOTHING. But, you gotta admit, this is an awesome movie! So…yeah! Read on and enjoy![Chapter 2] A/N Yeah...the names of my OCs...you know, if you watch Narnia, the names grow on you. So, the main character's name is Lucy, and then her little sister's name is Susan. So...I'm crediting Narnia for that. And I tried to put myself in someone's shoes who cannot stand Christmas. If I did a horrible job, I'm sorry. I'm usually not one who hates Christmas and stuff. So...enjoy! PROLOGUE I hate Christmas. And I don't care who hates me for it. I think I've always had a disliking for it. Ever since I was a baby, my mother told me I got fussy when the holidays rolled around, and I drooled and even spit up on my presents. As a toddler, I refused to eat Christmas dinner and always made a big fit when we went to Christmas Eve church. As a kid, I tried to boycott Christmas with loose-leaf paper signs. Now, as a teenager, I know just how to get my point across. I keep quiet and talk to no one until after Christmas is over. I don't know, exactly, why I hate Christmas. There are so many possibilities. There's the fact that it's so commercialized. I mean, everywhere you look, there's Santa and the reindeer, or there's snow and candy canes, or…something. People tend to miss the true meaning of Christmas. And since we're on that subject…all those holiday specials? Ugh! They're just as bad! Then there's all this…happiness. Everyone--and I mean, EVERYONE--is happy. Even the senile, cranky old people. Even the obnoxious, smart-aleck little kids. Even the bored, could-care-less employees at Target or Wal-Mart are all smiles. And the worst part is that three-quarters of this \"happiness\" isn't even real. As soon as the holidays are over, everyone goes back to their usual selves, cursing life and wishing they were somewhere else. But, now that I'm considering things, I think the real reason I hate it so much is because Christmas does some strange things to my family. My mother hates the holidays almost as much as I do. As usual, she does all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the shopping. And usually all that is doubled, considering all the people she needs to feed and take care of when the relatives come over. However, I know she really enjoys it. She just says she doesn't because she wants us all to feel sorry for her or…something stupid like that. My little sister, Susan, is just like all those little kids you see on TV: she wants everything on all those brightly colored ads. I know she's only, like, six, and she doesn't know any better about what Christmas really means…but it's just so annoying! She gets that lean, hungry look in her eyes every time we go to the mall or whatever, and begs my parents for every toy or game she sees. It gets on my nerves too easily. But the worst has to be my dad. Every year, a week before Christmas Eve, he goes up north with a few of his friends and they go ice fishing or something like that. He always tells Susan and I how he met his friends on some stupid magical train that visited him when he was our age and how he finally believed in Santa and blah, blah, blah. Mom gets super worried about him, and Susan, being the age she is, believes every word he says. The scary part is the bell. My dad has this sterling silver bell he hangs on the Christmas tree every year. I guess it's supposed to make a sound, but I can't hear it. Dad and Susan insist that they can hear it, but Mom and I keep telling them it's broken. But will they believe us? No. They keep saying how great Santa is or whatever. And I never had it in my heart to believe them. That is…until Christmas Eve. That was the night that changed my life. Forever.[Chapter 3] A/N Hey, everone! Um...just a warning: if you don't like moviefics, then I suggest you stop reading this story, cause a majority of this is going to be, basically, the Polar Express (as seen through the eyes of Lucy). So, yeah. I understand that some people cannot stand moviefics. But, in my opinion, I think seeing her father the way she is currently will really help Lucy believe more in the Christmas Spirit. And I also think it will help them grow closer as father and daughter. Oh, and sorry if this one's super short. I guess that's it! Happy reading! - CHAPTER ONE: CHRISTMAS SHOPPING So, every year, my dad takes Susan and I to the mall to do some shopping while my mom stays home and decorates the house. Now, being me, you've probably guessed that going to the mall means Christmas things EVERYWHERE. I just about fell over in utter disgust. Dad and Susan, however…well, let's just say I want the floor to swallow me up when I do Christmas shopping with them. They are so EMBARRASSING. I swear, people stare at us, and then I have to tell them, \"I've never met these people in my life.\" Anyway, after the mall, we went to the dollar store. Now, I guess it's not so bad. There's some cute stuff there…for little kids. But the best part is the really high shelves in the aisles. I can hide from Dad and Susan and they can never find me (unless I come up behind them and act like I was there the whole time). This time, however, was different. As I was pretending to be engrossed with the cleaning supplies (so those weirdo employees wouldn't bug me about anything), I turned around to see my dad standing with his arms folded. \"Lucy,\" he said, \"what are you doing?\" \"What does it look like I'm doing?\" I asked, trying to advert the attention away from myself. \"I'm trying to decide what cleaner will work best on the kitchen floor.\" I lowered my voice. \"You know how tough those grease stains get. I think we should go with the Swiffer Wet Jet Mop.\" I grabbed a package off the shelf and began to walk away. \"Hold it, young lady.\" I stopped in my tracks and reluctantly walked back to him. Dad shook his head. \"Lucy, don't try that with me. I know you're hiding from me and your sister.\" I scoffed. \"What makes you say that?\" Dad rolled his eyes, taking the Swiffer from me and putting it back. \"My daughter, who is one of the biggest slobs in the world, is all of a sudden interested in cleaning products?\" I rolled my eyes back, realizing there was no way out of this. \"Fine. You got me.\" \"I always do.\" His tone turned serious. \"Now, what is this really about?\" \"Wow. It's taken you thirteen years to figure it out?\" I asked, truly amazed. \"I've never liked the holidays. There's just something about them that just makes me go…ugh.\" I scrunched up my face to prove my point. \"Sweetie,\" my dad said consolingly. \"I know you've never been fond of this time of year. But…sometimes you just have to…believe in the unseen.\" I looked at him funny. \"Sure…let's just pretend I understand you.\" He sighed. \"You know what? I'm going to go find Susan and we'll go check out.\" He started to walk away when he turned back to me. \"Think about what I said,\" he told me. Then he walked away. I had no choice but to follow him. I really couldn't believe that after all that, he still had the idea in his head that all this Christmas stuff was real! Something needed to be done. Fast.[Chapter 4] A/N Hey, everyone! I honestly am astounded by the people reading this story! Thank you all for supporting me (even if this story is part moviefic!)! I am SOOOOOO grateful! I may post another chapter tonight...I'm not sure yet, cause I still have to finish a short story for my English class that's due tomorrow. But if I don't get around to it, it'll probably be on tomorrow. Until then, enjoy! P.S. I don't own the brand names Nick & Nora or Bearpaw. Idk what the NYC sweatshirt is...that one's kinda random... CHAPTER TWO: AN UNEXPECTED VISIT Well, if you know me well, you'll know I did nothing to help my dad and sister with their \"Christmas problem\". I just sat on the sidelines while they got crazier and crazier. My mom frequently had talks with my dad after they had put me and Susan to bed. I'm not one to eavesdrop, but I could hear bits and phrases of their conversation, like \"setting a bad example\" and \"putting our family in jeopardy\" and \"grow up\". I was guessing this wasn't a good thing. For some reason, I thought they were talking about Susan, because her name came up a lot in their conversations. I tried to convince Susan to pretend she didn't believe Dad, but she was too busy adding to her five-page-long Christmas list. It was then I realized that Susan wasn't the problem. Dad was. Dad was the one who was setting a bad example. Dad was the one putting our family in jeopardy. Dad was the one who had to grow up. After that, I got very scared. What if Mom and Dad got a divorce because of all this Christmas stuff? If they did…I didn't even want to think what would happen after that. I asked my mom about it, and she assured me nothing of the sort would happen. She said that she and Dad were \"having a colorful disagreement at the moment\". I could so tell she was treating me like Susan whenever she asked about that kind of stuff. I knew that if Dad didn't shape up soon, our family could potentially fall apart. ... The days flew by, and finally it was Christmas Eve. We went to church like we always did, and then went back to our house to greet our relatives. As usual, our house was buzzing with people, and everyone was tripping over everyone else to get to the food. I, personally, hung out by the wall where no one, save my grandparents and a few cousins, could bother me. Everyone finally went home, and the four of us remained once more. We watched some TV specials (which I hated), sang some Christmas carols (which I hated), and put out the cookies and milk for Santa (which I hated). After what seemed like forever, Mom and Dad put me and Susan to bed. I fell asleep immediately. ... For some reason, I awoke with a jolt some-odd hours later. I looked at the clock. 11:55. I sighed. Why couldn't time go faster? I wanted the night to end so I could get Christmas over with. Suddenly, I heard a distant rumbling sound. At first, I thought it was someone's stomach or something, but then I realized that it was too strong to be that. It belonged to something big. Something headed this way. The ground began to shake, and everything in my room began vibrating. I was about to scream \"Earthquake!\" when I stopped for two reasons: 1) We live in Michigan; the only earthquakes there are so small, you wouldn't notice them, and 2) no one had come into my room to help me out or whatever. I looked to the window. Through the curtains, a bright light shone in. A loud whistle sounded. As the ground continued to shake, I grabbed my black NYC zip-up hoodie and put it over my pink Nick & Nora panda bear pajamas. I ran downstairs and put my brown Bearpaw suede boots on, shaking as I did so. Then, not knowing what would be beyond the door, I took a deep breath and went outside.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER THREE: THE POLAR EXPRESS It had begun to snow, and there was a fresh blanket of the fluffy white stuff on the ground. The toes of my boots instantly were covered with newly fallen snowflakes, and I was shivering because of the cold. But I didn't notice. Because there, on my street, in front of my house, was a huge, black train. \"Oh, my God,\" I said to myself, walking up to it. How had this…machine gotten there? Whoever was driving must have been super drunk or something, because there were no tracks anywhere near my house. I shook my head in amazement as I stared up at the massive tank. \"ALL ABOARD!\" a voice rang out in the night. I turned around. In the glow of the bright lights coming from inside the train, I could see the silhouette of someone standing further down the line of train cars. My feet having a mind of their own, I began to walk through the snow towards the person. \"ALL ABOARD!\" the person called again. I was finally close enough to see the person clearly. It was a man…a really, really tall man (to me, at least; I was short for my age). He was in a nice-looking suit and he had a hat on his head that said CONDUCTOR. He wore glasses and he had a mustache. The whole time he stared at me, I was thinking, Okay…random creeper randomly comes to my house in a random train. Wow. What a bizarre dream. I really need to stop eating cold pizza before I go to bed. \"Well…\" the man said, interrupting my thoughts. \"You coming?\" I looked at him. \"What? Coming where?\" \"Why to the North Pole, of course!\" the man said, projecting his voice as if there was a whole crowd of people listening to him. \"This is the Polar Express!\" Oh, no. Not this AGAIN. I stared at him. \"Do you think I'm some sort of idiot?\" I asked him. \"Do you think I'd be so stupid and delirious to believe that this is some magic train that's going to take me to the North Pole?\" I started laughing. \"Wow!\" I said between breaths. \"You are so bizarre! Dude, did my dad call you or something? Did he seriously have you come here to make me believe in some stupid, silly train? Oh, my God!\" The man stood patiently, not saying anything. I stopped laughing and realized that my dad mustn't have called him. Which meant…this guy was for real. \"Oh, crap, you're serious,\" I said. The man continued to stare at me. \"Hold on a minute.\" He picked up a clipboard sitting on the steps leading up to the nearest train car and held it out to me. \"This is you, right?\" I looked at the piece of paper. Only one name was on it. Mine. \"If I answer no, will you leave me alone?\" \"No.\" \"Fine. Yeah, that's me.\" \"Well…it says here that you've despised Christmas ever since you were little. You've never enjoyed the holidays and always celebrated when they were over.\" He put the clipboard back and looked at me again. \"Yeah, so?\" I asked. \"Is there a problem with that?\" \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Is it a problem for you ?\" \"If you mean Christmas, then, yes, it is a problem. I mean…there's just something about it that I cannot stand! Everyone's so happy, and everyone has the lights and the bows and the trees and all that jazz. And…I don't know, I guess I never really had it in me to enjoy that.\" The man sighed. \"Young lady,\" he said, \"this train is a very special train. It doesn't come around every year, you know. And this was one of those years. But do you know why I'm breaking the rules and coming to your house?\" I shook my head. \"Because I guarantee you that by the end of tonight, you will believe in the Christmas Spirit like every other child who's ridden this train.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Sure. Let's go with that. You know what? I'll save you all the trouble of using the train this year. You can take it right back where it came from and wait till the next year it's scheduled to run.\" I turned around and started walking back to my house. The man shook his head. \"Like father, like daughter, I suppose.\" I stopped and turned around. \"What did you just say?\" \"I said, 'Like father, like daughter'.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"You mean he never told you?\" \"Well…yeah, he told me,\" I said, walking back over. \"I mean…yeah, Dad told me about the train and how he rode it and blah, blah, blah.\" \"He ever tell you he was just like you?\" My eyes widened. \"No.\" The man nodded. \"Get out. Dad was just like me?\" \"Yep. The year he rode this train, he had the same doubts as you.\" \"No way! Dad was never like that! He's too…I don't know, full of Christmas Spirit or whatever. He's always believed. I know he has. You are SO full of baloney, man.\" \"You don't believe me? Well, then, see for yourself.\" He stepped aside, making way for me to climb the steps. \"Okay…I don't get it,\" I said. \"You don't believe me? Well, I can give you proof. As soon as you step foot on this train, you and I will be transported back in time to the night your father rode this train. I will not remember you until the whole experience is over. And fair warning: if you call him 'Dad', he'll know. And it will freak him out. So please…don't do that.\" \"You serious?\" I asked. \"You want me to get on the train?\" \"Yes.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Whatever. You know, you're lucky I'm in such a generous mood.\" Little did I know what I was getting myself into.[Chapter 6] A/N Hola! Here it is! The first part of the moviefic section of this story! Oooh...it's so exciting... P.S. I had no clue what the name of the store in the movie is, so I changed it to Macy's (idk...it seems like a Christmasy-type of store...). Oh, and the whole Know-It-All Kid babble about the train...he talks so fast, I could only pick up half of what he was saying! So I just made the last part up, I guess... Enjoy! - CHAPTER FOUR: MEETING DAD I made it to the passenger car where all the other kids were. And, man, did I almost start laughing. These kids were dressed like total dorks! They had old-looking nightgowns and footy pajamas and everything. I thought they were SOOO weird… Apparently, they thought I was kinda weird, too, because they immediately stared at me like I had gills or something. I quickly sat down in a random seat, hoping no one would talk to me. For some reason, this girl across the aisle kept staring at me. I took a sidelong glance at her a few minutes later and she was STILL looking at me. Wow…she is super creepy, I thought a bit rudely. \"Hey!\" the kid sitting in front of me said. I turned to see a boy with nerdy glasses, looking me in the eye. \"Why do you look so strange?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"Maybe I don't. Maybe you do.\" \"Yeah, right,\" the kid said. \"I'm the normalest person you'll meet on here.\" \"Yep,\" I said. I looked to see that girl staring at me. Oh, what had I gotten myself into? \"So, where are you from?\" the nerdy kid asked me. \"Um…I'm from…Michigan,\" I said. \"Oh. Do you know where I'm from?\" \"Crazy Town?\" I muttered under my breath. \"Oh, no. I'm not from Crazy Town! That's on the other side of the river! I'm actually from Chicago! It's so windy there! Windier than you'd think! In fact, it's--\" And this continued for another few minutes. I tried to tune it out, but between Talkative Boy and the Eye-Eye Girl, I was about to explode. The train slowed down all of a sudden. \"Why did we stop?\" I asked. \"We're picking up another kid,\" the nerdy kid said. I looked out the window. I couldn't really see who we were picking up because of all the train smoke. However, whoever it was wasn't getting on the train. The conductor hopped back on and motioned for the train to start moving. \"Hold up!\" I said, running to the back. \"Why are we moving?\" I stopped myself. \"Wait, why do I even care?\" \"Go sit down, miss,\" the conductor said. \"I have matters under control.\" I had no choice but to do as I was told. About a minute later, a boy around my age got on the train and started walking down the aisle. He had yellow pajamas and a blue bathrobe. His hair was brown, just like mine. And he also had freckles on both sides of his face, like me, too… He seemed really familiar, somehow. From where, I didn't know. But then I saw a pocket of his bathrobe was ripped. And the hole was just big enough for a certain silver bell to slip through. I gasped. \"Dad?\" He stopped at the seat I sat in and looked at me. \"Huh?\" I quickly turned away, embarrassed. What was wrong with me? I was acting like someone I didn't know. And, man, was it scaring me. My dad sat down next to me, and I saw out of the corner of my eye that the weird girl was now staring at him. Okay, if she stole my dad, I was never going to forgive her-- \"Hey, you!\" the nerdy kid said. We both looked up. \"Yeah, you! Do you know what kind of train this is?\" My dad looked from side to side. \"Huh?\" \"Train. Do you know what kind of train this is? Well, do ya?\" \"Uh…how am I supposed to know?\" my dad asked. I just had to giggle at that. He looked at me and I immediately stopped. \"Sorry,\" I said. \"It's a magic train,\" the girl across the aisle said. \"We're going to the North Pole.\" \"Aw, I know it's a magic train,\" the nerdy kid continued. \"Actually, it's a Baldwin-284-S3-Class-First-Steam Locomotive…\" And he kept going on and on! Goodness, this kid was weird! \"Are we really going to the North Pole?\" my dad asked the girl. \"Mmm-hmm,\" she said, excited. \"Isn't that wonderful?\" My dad turned away. \"Yeah…if you believe in that kind of stuff.\" \"I hear you,\" I said. He turned to me. \"Huh?\" I gave him a look. \"What, you actually think I believe we're going to the North Pole? Heck no! I don't even know why I got on this stupid train.\" My dad nodded. \"I know what you mean.\" He stuck out his hand. \"I'm Chris.\" I shook his hand. \"Lucy.\" \"Lucy?\" he asked. \"Uh…yeah. Something wrong?\" \"No. It's just…that name seems familiar somehow…\" \"Oh, I hope it does,\" I said to myself. \"Hey, everyone!\" the nerdy kid shouted. \"Look! Look out the window! We're passing Macy's!\" Everyone raced to the windows to see the local Macy's all lit up with presents in the window. It was part of their Christmas display. \"Wow! Look at all those presents! I want all of them!\" the nerdy kid said more to himself than anyone else. I rolled my eyes. This kid was getting on my nerves. \"It's so beautiful,\" the girl said, her eyes taking on a dreamy look. I looked at my dad. He was watching the mechanical Santa in the window. The mechanical wheel attached to the robot's back was all it took for my father to shake his head and turn away. And for some reason…that bugged me. A lot. As the kids continued to watch the window, I came to a realization. I was beginning to care about Christmas. And all I could think was the following: HELP ME!!!!!!!!![Chapter 7] HEY!!! OMG I GOT INTO THE ONE-ACT PLAYS AT MY SCHOOL!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY!!! (I know you guys don't care, but...!!!!!) Since I'm in such a good mood, here's another chapter! Enjoy! - CHAPTER FIVE: TICKETS AND A NEW ARRIVAL \"Tickets!\" the conductor called. \"Tickets, please!\" He clicked a hole-puncher so fast, I thought it'd fly out of his hands and hit the ceiling. He stopped at our seat. \"Ticket, please,\" the conductor said. My dad stared blankly at him. \"Try your pocket,\" the conductor suggested. Dad stuck his hand in his ripped pocket. \"Try the other one,\" the conductor said, rolling his eyes. Dad did and pulled out a golden ticket with a picture of the train on it and the words \"Round Trip\". He stared, wide-eyed. \"Whoa, baby!\" I exclaimed. I smirked and put on a British accent. \"You've found Wonka's last Golden Ticket!\" Everyone stared at me. I giggled nervously. \"Just a joke,\" I said. \"What, y'all never seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ?\" As they continue to stare, I slunk down in my seat. Of course. The movie hadn't come out yet, and wasn't going to for another…thirty years or so. The conductor, ignoring my blunder, took my dad's ticket and punched not one, but many holes in his ticket. When he gave it back, on the ticket were the letters \"B\" and \"E\". Dad frowned, very confused. After my ticket was punched, I had the letters \"R\" and \"E\". Wow, this made absolutely no sense. I was starting to think that maybe, if I begged him long enough, the conductor would let me off the train. But…if I left now…I'd never return to my own time. I'd be stuck in the past. Where'd there'd be no cool movies. No iPods. And definitely no cellphone service. I had no choice but to stay put. \"What's with the random letters?\" I finally asked Dad, trying to start up a conversation. \"I have no idea,\" he admitted. \"Maybe it's supposed to spell a word or something.\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Or maybe more letters will be added later.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Boy, that guy sure likes to show of with that ticket punch of his,\" the nerdy kid said, turning around. \"Look at what the wise guy punched on my ticket!\" He held it out so we could see an \"L\" and an \"E\" on the ticket. \"L, E,\" he said. \"What the heck is that supposed to mean?\" As he walked away, I got an idea in my head. \"Maybe when his ticket's done, it'll spell 'Leave'.\" My dad started to laugh, which made me laugh, too. \"Next stop: 11344 Edbrook,\" the conductor said into the intercom. \"Oh, boy!\" the nerdy kid said. \"We're heading to the other side of the tracks!\" I scrunched up my face in confusion. \"What?\" My question wasn't answered. Instead, the train stopped in front of a small, yellow house. The conductor got off the train and met a small boy with big, black boots on. Dad, the nerdy kid and I stuck our heads out the window to check out the scene. \"Aw, whatever!\" the nerdy kid said, waving his hand passively. \"It's just another pick-up.\" He turned to my dad. \"That's weird. I thought you were the last one on the list.\" After he stuck his head back in, I heard the conductor announce his famous line about the train. \"Does he say that to everyone?\" I asked. \"He said it to me,\" Dad answered. \"He said it to me, too.\" Dad nodded. \"He must rehearse or something.\" The boy in the boots stepped back, indicating he wasn't coming with. \"Suit yourself,\" the conductor said, jumping back on. He signaled to the driver, and the train started up again. As the train started pulling away, the little boy looked up at us with sad eyes. All Dad could do was feebly wave at the poor kid. Suddenly, the kid started running. It must have been hard with those boots, because he looked as if he'd trip any second. \"Come on!\" my dad called to him. \"Hurry up!\" The kid accidentally tripped, the train going by without a care. That image was engraved in my mind at that moment, and as it was, it struck a cord in me and I had a revelation. I turned to my dad. \"We have to stop the train.\"[Chapter 8] A/N Hey! I might not post anything tomorrow (due to a choir concert, that short story I was writing earlier, and a few tests I have to study for). But the good news is that I will be pretty much free for all of Christmas vacation! So I'll be posting more! Happy reading! - CHAPTER SIX: A HORRIBLE MISTAKE \"We have to stop the train!\" Dad said when the two of us had stuck our heads back in. \"I don't know how to stop the train!\" the girl said. Dude…we weren't asking you! I thought. \"The emergency brake!\" the nerdy kid cried, pointing to a handle on the back wall. Dad ran to the stepladder on the back wall and pulled the brake. We heard the brakes squeal, and we were all suddenly thrown forward and onto the floor. As we picked ourselves up, I saw my dad wave at someone. I guessed that the little boy had gotten on the train. But…he didn't enter our car. He went to the one next to it. Well, as you can imagine, the conductor stormed in, livid. \"Who in the blazes applied that emergency brake?!\" he shouted. The nerdy kid stood up. \"He did!\" he said, pointing to Dad. What a tattletale! I thought, glaring at him. But as the conductor approached us, all I could think was, Oh, snap…we are SOOOO dead. The conductor stood facing Dad, staring him down. \"In case you didn't know, that cord is for emergency purposes only! And in case you didn't know, tonight--\" here he made his signal out the window to the driver to drive \"--is Christmas Eve! And this train is on a very tight schedule!\" \"But--\" I tried to cut in. \"Now, young man,\" the conductor continued, not even noticing me, \"Christmas may not be important to some people, but it is very important to the rest of us!\" \"But…but--\" Dad stuttered. \"He was just stopping the train so that kid could get on!\" the girl piped up. The conductor looked to the next car and saw the boy. \"Oh…I see.\" He turned to my dad again. \"Young man…is that what happened?\" Dad nodded vigorously. He turned to me and the girl, and all three of us nodded. I could tell the conductor was at a loss of words. Ha, ha…you don't have anything to say to that, do you? \"Well…let me remind you: this train is on a very tight schedule! And I have never been late before…and I am certainly not going to be late tonight! Now, everyone: take your seats, please!\" No one wasted any time getting back to the seats. I lingered a bit on purpose, just to annoy the conductor, but when he gave me his signature glare, I quickly sat down. He then picked up the intercom and asked if any of us wanted refreshments or whatever. I was the only one who didn't raise my hand. Hello! I had had cold pizza before I went to bed! If anything, I was full! But then these dancing waiters and chefs came out with HOT CHOCOLATE. And, if you know me well, you know that, whatever the circumstances, I cannot resist hot chocolate…especially coming from dancing, singing waiters. After they were gone, everyone was stuffed. But that didn't stop from the nerdy kid from talking some more about random stuff. Dad and I exchanged glances, trying to keep our laughter to ourselves. As the nerdy kid started talking to other kids, I noticed the girl across the aisle going under her seat. When she emerged, a cup of hot chocolate was in her hands. I figured she must have sneaked it there. \"Where are you going with that?\" Dad asked. She smiled at us. \"It's for him,\" she said simply, and I knew instantly she meant the kid in the other train car. \"I don't think we're supposed to leave our seats,\" Dad pointed out. \"Yeah!\" the nerdy kid chimed in. \"It's a violation of railroad safety regulations for a kid to cross moving cars without a grownup.\" I sighed. \"Normally, I wouldn't agree with you, nerdy kid--\" \"It's Eddy, actually.\" \"Fine. Normally, I wouldn't agree with nerdy kid--\" Here he gaped at me \"--but I really think you shouldn't do that.\" The girl stared at the three of us. \"I think I'll be okay.\" \"Are you sure?\" Dad persisted as she walked away. She suddenly stopped. I thought it was cause Dad had finally gotten her goat or whatever, but then I heard heavy footsteps behind us. I turned and saw the conductor approaching us again. Uh-oh… The girl turned around and stared up at the conductor. \"What about this lad in the back?\" he asked. \"Did he get anything?\" The girl shook her head no. \"Well, then! Let's take some to him, by all means!\" he exclaimed, leading the girl to the door. They exited without a problem. \"Uh-oh!\" Dad said. \"She forgot her ticket!\" He picked it up and examined it. \"It hasn't been punched.\" \"Yeah. So?\" I asked. \"When they get back, she can get it punched. No biggie.\" But my dad had other plans. He ran to the door and opened it. \"Hey, what are you doing?\" Eddy, the nerdy kid, said. \"You're going to get us all in trouble!\" \"I hate to agree with him, but…seriously, Chris, you can't do this!\" The cold air rushed in, and Dad was on the edge, about ready to cross. He didn't do so at first, and I saw him teeter a little. I was about ready to drag him back in when he started grabbing at something. I looked out the window and saw a flash of gold. He had let the stupid thing go. He pushed past me to where the ticket was caught in one of the windows. He opened it carefully, but the ticket flew away, anyway, out of his grasp. I sighed and tilted my head back. This was SO not good.[Chapter 9] Hey! Here's another chapter! Enjoy! CHAPTER SEVEN: NO COMMON SENSE The conductor and the girl soon came back in. Dad couldn't bear to look at them. I put an awkward hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him, but it didn't work. It only got worse when the conductor asked for the girl's ticket. \"I left my ticket right here on the seat,\" she insisted, \"but it's gone.\" \"You mean, you have lost your ticket?\" the conductor said loudly, as if he wanted the whole world to hear. Wow…he's being such a jerk about all this! Just get her a new one! \"She didn't lose it,\" Dad said, getting up out of his seat. \"I did.\" Everyone turned to look at him. He shyly made his way over to the girl and the conductor. \"I was…trying to return it to you,\" Dad explained. \"But the wind blew it out of my hand.\" Goodness, you are so STUPID, Dad! You shouldn't have touched the dang thing in the first place! Why must these people be so…ignorant to common sense? WHY? \"Here,\" Dad sad, pulling his own ticket out of his pocket. \"You can have mine.\" He started handing it to the girl, who was about to take it gratefully. I figured this could work. I mean…SOMEONE needed a new ticket in the end. But I guess the conductor had other plans, because he snatched it out of my dad's hands and gave it back. \"These tickets are no transferable!\" he said darkly. My eyes widened. I had never seen him so…scary before. Sure, maybe frustrated…but never scary. No, not scary. More like…crazy. Insane. Belonging in the nuthouse. \"Young lady,\" the conductor continued. \"You will just have to come along with me.\" He led her to the door of the car and shut it behind him, shaking his head at Dad. \"You know what's gonna happen now?\" Eddy said. \"He's gonna throw her off the train!\" \"WHAT?\" I exclaimed. \"Yeah! They do it all the time!\" \"No! Not to a kid! That's horrible! Besides, if he does, I'll just kick his butt!\" \"He will!\" Eddy insisted. \"He'll probably throw her right off the rear platform! It's standard procedure! That way, she won't get sucked down under the wheels!\" A very terrible image came into my mind as he said that sentence. And what made it worse was all Dad could do was stare at the door. He had to do something! This was his problem! He had to fix it! Or…did I have to? Was that the whole reason I had even got on the train? To help my Dad fix his petty problems and help him gain the common sense he obviously lacked? I shook my head. I was so gullible. \"They may slow the train down a little bit, but they're never gonna stop it!\" Eddy went on. My dad's face lit up as a light bulb went off in his head. \"That's it! I have to stop the train again!\" he said, reaching for the handle. \"NOOOO!\" we all shouted. \"Not again!\" But he never got the chance to. Because before he did, he saw a flash of gold in the vent that was right above the handle. He reached in, and out came the ticket. \"Oh, my...\" I said, trailing off. How had that thing gotten back? Well, whatever had happened to it, finding it in the air vent was all that needed to happen, because my dad began to head toward the door. \"No, wait!\" I said. \"What?\" \"I'm coming with.\" \"No, you're not! You have to stay here.\" \"Well, it's pretty obvious you're going to mess something up again-\" Dad's eyebrows knitted together. \"Are you saying I mess things up?\" \"Well…\" I said sheepishly. \"Not all the time-\" \"Oh, that makes me feel so much better. You know, just for that, I'm making you stay in this car. Whether you like it or not.\" With that, he turned around, opened the door, and jumped to the next car. And for some reason…I had the sudden impulse to sit down. I don't know what made me do it. I just…did it. It was weird. Very weird. ... Ten minutes later, my legs were going up and down because I was so nervous. Dad hadn't come back yet. \"That's it,\" I said, making up my mind and walking toward the door. \"I'm going out there.\" \"No!\" Eddy said. \"You can't do that! Those other two are in enough trouble as it is! If you go out there, we're all dead meat!\" I turned to face him. \"Does it look like I care? My da-my very close friend is out there, risking his life!\" I turned around and faced that dreaded door. \"And I have to save him.\"[Chapter 10] Hey, everone! I know this chapter's a little short...but, trust me...it's far from boring! CHAPTER EIGHT: FLAT-TOP TUNNEL After crossing between cars, I ran down the aisle of the second car. The boy sitting there didn't seem to notice me, which didn't affect me in the least. I flung open the door at the back of the car, and all that awaited me was train tracks, snow, and really cold wind. No one was there. Shoot! Don't tell me all three of them jumped off! Suddenly, I heard a voice on top of the roof. \"Wait!…Wait!\" it called into the darkness. I cocked my head. Wait for what? \"Wake up!\" I suddenly heard it say. \"Wake up! WAKE UP!\" I listened closer and then I realized who it was. Dad. But then there was another voice. Saying something about… \"jumpin' them knuckles\". Uh, no. Absolutely not. I had no idea what that meant, but there was no way my father was jumping anything. I began to climb the ladder to the roof. As soon as I got up there, I was faced with something startling: my father hanging from the roof and some crazy hobo on skis. \"DAD!\" I screamed. \"LUCY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE? I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR!\" I was about to answer, but the hobo quickly stuck out his ski pole to Dad. He grabbed on, and they were off, the hobo obviously not seeing me. Well, that was just great. I got to spend the next some-odd minutes chasing my dad and a hobo on skis, all while on top of a fast-moving locomotive. Oh, yeah. This so beat staying at home. ... Jumping from car roof to car roof is harder than it looks. It didn't help that the wind was blowing against the way I was going and that it was snowing. But it did help that the train was going downhill. And the cars weren't spaced that far apart. After every car I jumped, I saw a black blur getting closer and closer. I knew that that was my dad, and that kept me going. Just knowing that I was getting nearer to him, knowing that I had a chance to help him…that was all that mattered. I finally caught up with them and stood right behind them. As I breathed a sigh of relief, I saw that we were approaching a tunnel. The opening looked just like the mouth of a monster, sharp icicles dangling from the top. Over the roar of the wind, I heard the word \"JUMP!\" And the hobo disappeared! Dad jumped into the coal car, but didn't sink in right away. His head still poked out of the pile of coals, and he had a pretty good view of me. \"DAD!\" I called. \"LUCY! LOOK OUT!\" I looked up to see the tunnel opening nearing pretty fast. I screamed, but my voice was lost in the wind. As my dad sank into the coal pile, I could hear him cry, \"LUCY! NOOOOOO!\" I closed my eyes and prepared to hit the tunnel wall. And then everything went black.[Chapter 11] CHAPTER NINE: DAD SAVED ME! I saw Dad. Falling, falling, falling…into a bottomless pit. I tried to call out, but no words would come. It was as if I was glued to wherever I was. And all I could do was watch him fall, fall, fall… \"DAD!\" I finally shouted, sitting up and breathing heavily. I looked around and saw that I was in an empty passenger car, much like the one the little boy had been in. And then in hit me. I was alive! I wasn't dead! But…how? I was sure I'd hit the tunnel! I'd passed out, hadn't I? So…how did that explain…? \"And she's awake!\" I heard a gruff voice say. I turned to see a different hobo, sitting around a makeshift campfire. \"Oh, thank God, she's awake!\" I stared at him. \"What…what happened?\" \"Do you really think you should be asking me that?\" he asked. I continued to stare at him blankly. He sighed. \"With that look you're giving me, I'm starting to understand why you just stood there.\" \"Stood there? You mean…?\" I pointed upward. \"Yeah. You was just standing there, with your toothpick arms over your head. I couldn't let you be so stupid! So I pulled you through the roof and in here.\" He indicated the car. I nodded, starting to understand. \"But…how could you possibly have known? I was the only one up there…besides my dad.\" He nodded. \"I know, I know.\" My eyes widened. \"You know what? That we were the only ones up there, or that I'm really…?\" \"Both.\" \"What? But how…that's impossible! Realistically, as of right now, I'm the only one who knows!\" He looked at me. \"Do you believe in ghosts?\" \"I don't see how that could…\" I trailed off, staring at him as he grinned at me. \"We folks know these things,\" he said. I nodded slowly, trying to process this information. \"So…where is my dad, anyway?\" \"How am I supposed to know?\" \"You're a ghost! I thought ghosts knew these things!\" He packed up his supplies in one swift move as the fire went out. \"We only know the things we want to know.\" Suddenly, the train was coming to a stop. I ran to the front of the car. \"I think I know where he is!\" I exclaimed. I turned around, and the hobo was gone. ... Now, as you can imagine, I had no time to worry about some crazy hobo. I jumped out of the car and somehow managed to climb onto the roof. I plopped down, holding myself and breathing heavily. It was the first time in about a half-hour that I could really calm myself and think about things. I looked out over the frozen tundra to see why we'd stopped. A bunch of caribou were standing in our way. And I'm not talking maybe thirty or forty. I'm talking hundreds. Thousands. Hundreds of thousands. Millions, maybe. \"CARIBOU CROSSING?\" the conductor yelled, obviously frustrated. I laughed. For some reason, it made me laugh to see him very, very angry. I heard footsteps beside the train, and the sounds of grunting as someone tried to climb up the car. A head suddenly came into view, and my dad climbed onto the roof. \"Oh, thank the Lord,\" he said, crawling over to me. But his relieved tone didn't last long. \"What were you thinking? I told you to stay in the car! I don't know how it happened, but you're alive, and you should be very thankful! It could have been a whole lot worse!\" He started breathing heavily, tired from his mini-tirade. I looked at him, having the impulse to start crying. Which I did. I threw my arms around him and buried my face in his shoulder, sobbing up a storm. He froze at first, not sure what to do, but then put his own arms around me and held me tightly. \"It's okay,\" he said consolingly. \"It's gonna be okay…\" \"It was the hobo,\" I said, my voice muffled. \"What?\" \"The hobo,\" I said, pulling away and looking at him. \"He said he knew I was in trouble and pulled me through the roof just as I was going to hit the tunnel.\" He stared at me and then looked away. \"That is so weird,\" he said, \"because right when you were going to hit, I…I prayed that…you would be safe. That you wouldn't…you know…\" We sat in silence, knowing what had occurred was truly a miracle.[Chapter 12] Hello, everyone! Sorry I didn't post anything yesterday. I was at my grandparents' house...and, well, let's just say their Internet connection isn't the best. So I virtually had no computer. But now I'm home again and can post some more! Yay! P.S. I wouldn't count on this being done by Christmas...maybe a couple days after... Enjoy! CHAPTER TEN: CARIBOU COFFEE AND GLACIER GULCH \"We'd better get down there,\" I said after a minute. \"We wouldn't want Mr.-I'm-Never-Late to get any more frustrated than he already is.\" \"Yeah,\" Dad agreed. \"I think if he blows up one more time, that vein in his head will pop.\" We both laughed at that as we climbed carefully down from the car and joined the others. \"We're in some serious jelly,\" the conductor was saying. \"Jelly? Ooh! I could go for some jelly with toast!\" I piped up. \"And maybe some coffee from Caribou! Get it? Caribou Coffee? And there's caribou? He turned and glared at me. As soon as he looked away, I started to snicker. I suddenly heard this really weird moaning sound. It turned out that Dad and slipped and, trying to grab ahold of something, he grabbed the beard of one of the engineer's. One of the caribou in front made a similar sound, but it was more high-pitch. This gave the conductor an idea. He did the same thing Dad did a couple more times, and, miraculously, the caribou moved off the tracks! If that wasn't a miracle, I didn't know what was. Oh, wait…never mind. ... The engineers went back to the coal car to start up the train again, which left the conductor, the weird girl, Dad and I at the front of the train. For some reason, I had a bad feeling in my stomach. A feeling something was going to happen. Something bad. \"We're going pretty fast,\" my dad remarked. And we were. The train started to move faster and faster and faster… The conductor turned to the girl. \"Tell the engineer to slow down, Shannon,\" he said. Shannon? So that was her name? Well, I guess it was better that way. I wouldn't have to call her weird girl anymore. As soon as I thought that, I realized I was starting to…change. I was starting to care about things. I was starting to believe. Oh, man. I hated this train. Anyway, Shannon yelled to the engineers to slow down, but as soon as she did, I knew it was hopeless. We were going so fast, her tiny voice was probably lost in the wind the second the words came out of her mouth. \"They can't hear me!\" Shannon reported. Oh, great, I thought. Those bumbling idiots have really done it now! They probably broke something on accident and now are trying to fix it, so they can't hear her! We started to pass warning signs-the kind you'd see going up to the Wicked Witch of the West's castle-and the tracks started to get rickety. I made an effort to look down and saw that frail wooden beams were the only thing holding us up. I gripped Dad's hand tightly, and I saw that he tried not to grimace in pain. \"I don't like the look of this,\" the conductor said. \"Quick! Under the safety bar!\" \"Is everything…is everything all right?\" Dad asked worriedly, managing to wriggle his hand out of mine. \"What should we do?\" \"Well,\" the conductor said, tying a belt around all four of us, \"considering the fact that we have lost communication with the engineers, we are standing totally exposed on the front of a locomotive, the train appears to be accelerating uncontrollably, and we are rapidly approaching Glacier Gulch-which just happens to be the steepest downhill track in the world, I suggest that we all hold on…TIGHTLY!\" We hit the drop, and down we went. It was just like Valley Fair's fastest, biggest roller coaster, the Wild Thing. Only steeper. And scarier. And I wasn't sure I was going to make it off alive this time. I obviously had no time to think because all four of us were screaming. Dad was now crushing my hand with his-either for payback or for comfort or both, I'm not sure-and screaming like a girl. I would have laughed, but I was too busy trying not to notice that my stomach kept dropping. \"Jiminy Crickets!\" the conductor yelled. \"The ice is frozen over the tracks!\" I had no idea what he was talking about, so I looked at him funny. Then he pointed straight ahead, and I saw what he meant. There was a huge lake coming up, and it was frozen. No tracks were in sight. And for the third time that night, I assumed we were all dead.[Chapter 13] A/N: About the names of Know-It-All and Hero Girl...I made them up. I don't own them. I just thought they needed names. And any brand names or other references I make to real-world things...I don't own those, either. - CHAPTER ELEVEN: THE NEXT TITANIC As soon as the train hit the ice, it skidded this way and that. I sighed. As if almost getting smushed by a tunnel and going down really steep tracks wasn't enough! Now we had to go ice-skating? We hit an iceberg and Shannon practically fell off. The conductor grabbed hold of her, but then he was about to fall off, so Dad and I got ahold of him. And as soon as it looked like all four of us would go tumbling off…my dad turned around to look at something. I looked to where he was looking and saw the hobo that had saved me. We finally got back on the train, the hobo disappearing as we did so. Dad and I exchanged glances. It was about time those moronic engineers fixed whatever they were fixing, because the train finally slowed down and stopped. But not before turning itself all the way around. The four of us made our way to the engineers. \"What in the name of Mike…?\" the conductor began. As he was about to continue, something caught my eye. A little golden stick was sticking out of the ice. And coming out from there were cracks. Cracks that were moving quickly toward the train. I gasped. The conductor, Shannon, and Dad all looked at me and then to the ice. There was a huge cracking sound, and they instantly realized what I had figured out. The ice was breaking. \"Get us the blazes out of here!\" the conductor commanded. The engineers were able to turn the train around, thank goodness. We began to head away from the breaking ice, but to where, I had no idea. \"Look!\" Dad said, pointing to a sliver in the huge icebergs lining the lake. \"Tracks!\" the conductor cried. I started bouncing up and down slightly. Sure, we had found tracks. But the question was would we make it in time? Considering our track record and the close calls from earlier, I was beginning to think--once again--that this was the end. While I was thinking about this, I saw that stupid ticket fly in front of my face. Why did I even bother? \"You're going to lose your ticket!\" Shannon told him. \"It's not my ticket, it's yours!\" Dad said. \"It's MY ticket?!\" \"Yeah!\" They both started frantically grabbing for it. I would have, but it was too far out of my reach. That…and I was just so sick of the stupid thing! \"OH, NO!!!!\" they both screamed. I looked and saw that the train was sinking. So this was how it ended? This train being the next Titanic ? \"BRACE YOURSELVES!!!\" the conductor hollered. He didn't have to tell me twice. So you can see how happy I was when I heard metal against metal and saw that the train had made it on the tracks. \"WE DID IT!!!\" I started jumping up and down like an idiot, hugging them both. \"OH, MY GOSH WE ALMOST DIDN'T! BUT WE DID!!!! YAY!!!!\" \"Calm down, Lucy,\" Dad said, laughing, and I suddenly felt relaxed. Dad stared at me and I at him. There was something weird going on… \"Thank you!\" Shannon said, hugging him and completely cutting of my train of thought. Thanks for that, I thought. \"I can' believe you found my ticket!\" she said. As if on cue, the conductor popped his head up. \"Did someone say they found the ticket? Well, then…tickets, please.\" He did his punching routine and handed it back. I was surprised to see the familiar \"L\" and \"E\". \"L, E?\" she thought out loud. \"Hey, you're like that one know-it-all kid…\" Dad said. \"His name's Eddy,\" I said. They both looked at me and my eyes widened. \"Oh, my gosh…I DO care!\" I said, slapping my forehead. They laughed, and I couldn't help but join in.[Chapter 14] Hello! I would just like to thank my good friend, Shinjite Florana, who gave me the idea for the hobo to save Lucy the way he did. She brought me out of my writer's block! Thank you! P.S. I do not own the brand Emit Kelly. And I also do not own the lyrics to the song \"Purpose\" or the rights of \"Avenue Q\". CHAPTER TWELVE: A TALK WITH DAD The conductor felt it was best if we got back to the passenger car so the other kids wouldn't be totally freaked out. Personally, I didn't care what we did. As long as I got a piece of mind and got to relax for more than five seconds, I was all for whatever. We had a hard time getting there, since it was kinda slippery. I suppose the conductor thought it was necessary to accompany the experience with a story. \"Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run, I was up on the roof making my rounds when I slipped on the ice myself! It looked like I was done for, yet I did not fall off this train.\" \"Someone saved you?\" Shannon asked. \"Or some thing .\" I took a sharp breath. I knew instantly it was the hobo. \"An angel!\" Shannon said. \"Maybe…\" the conductor said, not really agreeing. I guess Dad was thinking the same thing I was, cause he climbed down from the roof and started following the conductor. \"Wait, wait! What did he look like? Did you see him?\" \"No, sir! But sometimes seeing is believing. And sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can't see.\" After that, a silence followed as we walked back to the car. On the way there, we passed through a car filled with all sorts of toys. I don't know about the others, but I was really uncomfortable in there. Especially when I saw an Emit Kelly doll. I pushed ahead and made it to the passenger car. Shannon went on to the next one, but I was eager to ask the conductor something. \"Hey,\" I said. \"Um…have you noticed something weird about Da-I mean, Chris?\" \"No.\" \"Well…it seems that when he gives me a command…I have to do it.\" \"He must have some authority then,\" he remarked, walking away. I rolled my eyes. Some help you are. Dad came in and slammed the door shut. I guessed he got freaked out, too. And maybe it wasn't just because of the Emit Kelly. \"Um…hi,\" I said. He looked at his feet and said nothing. \"What's wrong?\" \"He's right.\" \"Whoa…who's right?\" He looked at me. \"The hobo.\" I looked from side to side. \"Right about what?\" \"That I'm a Scrooge. I'm killing Christmas.\" \"Oh, come on. You are not. Maybe that hobo has amazing reflexes…and, sure, maybe he knows a thing or two about…important stuff. But when it comes to you, I know he's one-hundred percent wrong.\" \"How can you know for sure?\" Well, what could I say to that? I know because I'm your future daughter? \"I know…because I can tell that you're a good person. All you need is a little nudge.\" It sounded like the cheesiest thing I'd ever said, but I think it helped, because he gave me a smile. \"You missed it!\" Eddy said, coming up to us. \"We rode down some really sharp hills! And then we were on what looked like a frozen lake! But I know it was just an optical illusion caused by moonlight and atmosphere!\" \"Um…I really don't care, kid-\" I started. Dad wasn't listening anymore. He was looking at the other passenger car. \"He said the train was actually on the ice!\" Eddy went on. \"But I said that was impossible! Because you can't put a train track-\" Dad went toward the door, me in tow. \"Hey, where are you going?\" Eddy called after us. But we were already in the other car. ... When we got there, Shannon was spying on the little kid, who was singing a song about Christmas. Shannon joined in, and it sounded pretty good, I guess. I never saw the kid smile before, and he really looked…happy. Shannon took him inside after that. I think she wanted to talk to him about something. But whatever the reason, I went out and watched the Aurora Borealis paint the sky with beautiful swirls. \"Wow,\" Dad breathed. \"I've never seen it up close. It's so beautiful.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. I looked at him and smiled. For some reason, this moment was just…perfect. Watching the Northern Lights with my dad on some stupid magical train on Christmas Eve…it was a bit odd, but I liked it. Dad noticed me looking at him. \"What are you looking at?\" I kept smiling. \"Nothing.\" \"Do you know something I don't?\" \"Maybe…\" Dad looked down and picked up something shiny. \"Hey, look! A penny!\" He looked closely at it. \"It's from the year I was born.\" I found the perfect opportunity to ham up this musical moment. \"It's a sign!\" I sang loudly. I started to dance, but Dad got creeped out pretty quickly, so I stopped. He laughed and shook his head. \"There's something about you, Lucy…I don't know what…but you seem so familiar…\" I shrugged. \"You must know a lot of girls like me, is all.\" He shook his head. \"I…actually don't know a lot of people-let alone girls-like you. But…that's a good thing.\" He smiled. \"Truthfully, as of right now…you're the only friend I've ever had.\" That hit me deep. How was I supposed to answer? I mean, I had had a lot of friends in my life time. What was I supposed to do? Lie? No. I couldn't do that to him. It was bad enough he couldn't know who I really was. So I took a deep breath and said the following: \"Well, truthfully for me…you're the best friend I've ever had.\" He looked and looked at me for what seemed like forever. Then, out of nowhere, he hugged me. I could have sworn he started crying as he did so. And as I hugged him back, I could have sworn that at that moment, we had no secrets between us and that he knew the truth.[Chapter 15] CHPATER THIRTEEN: NORTH POLE ARRIVAL \"Hey! You kids,\" the conductor said. \"We just crossed it: latitude 66 degrees, 33 minutes…the Artic Circle. And do you see those lights in the distance? They look like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea. There…is the North Pole. This is how everyone reacted: Shannon's smile grew another five inches. The little kid went back inside, not even wanting to see. Dad looked up at the conductor with a mixture of surprise and disbelief on his face. I took one look at those lights and something hit me: it really did exist. I felt a bit woozy, and then for the second time that night, everything went black. ... When I started to stir, I heard nothing. I opened one eye and found myself laying on my own seat. \"Aw, I knew she'd be okay,\" I heard Eddy remark. \"Look, she's waking up.\" I opened both eyes and found that Dad, Shannon, and Eddy were all crowding my seat. I sat up, confused. \"What happened?\" \"You fainted,\" Dad said. \"It's a good thing your head didn't hit the floor hard,\" Shannon said. \"Or that she didn't fall the other way: off the train,\" Eddy said. \"Or maybe that would have been a good thing…\" I glared at him. \"Well, my work's done here,\" he said, walking off. \"I hope you're feeling better,\" Shannon said. She got up, my dad following. He stopped after a few paces and looked back at me. \"Um,\" he said to Shannon, \"I think I'm going to…make sure she's completely fine.\" Shannon nodded and went back to her seat. \"Hey,\" Dad said, sitting next to me. \"You feeling better?\" \"A little bit.\" He put his hand on my forehead. \"You seem a bit warm…\" Oh, gee. I wonder why. Maybe it's cause you're making a big idiot out of yourself by doing that, not to mention embarrassing me. \"I'll be fine,\" I said, carefully putting his arm down. \"I just got a bit…surprised, is all.\" I made it back to my regular seat no problem. Dad followed me, just to make sure. \"We make it?\" I ask. Dad pointed out the window. \"See for yourself.\" I looked out and saw little brick streets lined with little brick houses, which were decorated with little Christmas wreaths and holly. It was cute, I suppose… \"Where are the elves?\" someone asked. \"Shouldn't there be elves?\" another kid inquired. \"They are gathering in the center of the city,\" the conductor explained. \"That's where Santa will give the First Gift of Christmas.\" Eddy popped his head up at the mention of this. \"Who gets the First Gift?\" \"He will choose one of you,\" the conductor answered in an ominous voice. For some reason, he looked right at my dad. Dad's reaction was frowning. I figured he thought that he was the last person to receive the First Gift of Christmas. He-besides me-didn't really deserve it. Before further discussion could ensue, a couple other kids pointed out elves walking alongside the train. They were a bit shorter than I'd expected elves to look like, and they all had matching red outfits. The train stopped, and everyone got off. The conductor rambled on and on about how he wanted us to proceed to the center of the city. I wasn't really listening because it was SOOOO boring. \"It's five minutes to midnight!\" he suddenly exclaimed. \"Hey, what gives?\" Eddy asked him. \"It was five minutes to midnight four minutes ago!\" \"Exactly!\" the conductor said, going back to his rambling about two straight columns and whatnot. \"Excuse me,\" Shannon politely interrupted. \"What about him?\" She pointed to the last car where the little kid still sat. \"No one is required to see Santa,\" he said, going to the front of the group. This, I guess, wasn't a good enough answer for her. She ended up dragging me and Dad with her to the car to try and get the kid to come with. But as soon as my dad set foot on the car, he hit something with his foot, and I knew that something was going to go wrong. Again.[Chapter 16] A/N: Hey, everyone! I might have this finished by Christmas! It's still a little iffy...I'm going to be pretty busy the next two days, considering Christmas and stuff. But I'm probably going to post another chapter or two tonight! P.S. About the chapter title...um, the real title for the movie is \"Madeline Lost in Paris\", based on the Madeline books. But my dad thought he'd be funny and call it \"Madeline Lost in Prison\" or something. And I was rereading this chapter, trying to figure out what to call it, and I thought of that. So...yeah. I don't own Madeline. That belongs to...whoever wrote it (his name slips my mind at the moment...). And I do love Madeline...I just thought I'd stick that random thing in there, since I'm so random... CHAPTER FOURTEEN: MADELINE LOST IN PRISON \"You have to come with us,\" Shannon told the little boy when we got in the car. \"She's…she's right…\" Dad panted, out of breath. The little boy looked up at us with his big, brown eyes. \"Christmas just doesn't work out for me. Never has.\" \"But Christmas is such a wonderful, beautiful time!\" Shannon persisted. \"It's a time for giving and being thankful. For friends and family. People hang decorations and lights. And then Santa leaves presents under our Christmas trees.\" \"Christmas just…doesn't work out for me,\" the little boy said, shrugging. Dad sighed. \"Look, I don't know if Christmas is going to work out for you or not, but this is Christmas Eve. Don't stay here by yourself.\" \"Yeah!\" I chipped in. \"Don't be like me every year and exclude yourself from everyone! I mean, I have an excuse, but you don't, dude.\" All three of them looked at me. \"What? That's what I do.\" \"Um…I think what she's trying to say is…you should come with us…\" Shannon said slowly. \"We'll go together.\" The boy looked from me to Shannon to Dad and back again. Before he said anything, we all felt the train start to move. Or rather…the train car start to move. \"Okay…what was that?\" I asked. Dad opened the door and revealed what I had been dreading as soon as he had stepped on: the train car had disconnected itself from the rest of the train, and we were now moving slowly away. \"Oh, snap,\" I said. We all ran to the back--which was technically the front, considering that was the end that was moving first--and looked to see where we were going. \"It's gonna be okay,\" Dad said. But he spoke too soon. We hit a track switcher that led to a really steep hill. \"Maybe NOOOOOOTTTT!\" Dad shouted, changing his mind. We all held on for dear life as the car plummeted down the steep hill. I, for one, had had my fill of roller coaster-like rides, so I was the one who was screaming at the top of my lungs, \"WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" \"THE EMERGENCY BREAK!\" Dad said. \"I'M GOING TO FIND THE EMERGENCY BREAK!\" He began to move the other way, towards the front of the car, leaving the three of us to cling on to whatever. \"THERE'S NO BREAK!\" Dad called back to us once he had reached the front. \"I CAN'T FIND A BREAK!\" \"OH, NOW THAT'S JUST GREAT!\" I hollered. \"NOW WHAT?!\" The car suddenly was plunged into darkness as we went through a tunnel. \"ONLY AT THE NORTH POLE, RIGHT?!\" I remarked. No sooner had I said this comment, we came to a circular room with a circular platform in the center. The tracks we were on led to this platform, and there was a stopper at the very middle. \"WE'RE GONNA CRASH!\" Shannon said. And we did. Well…I wouldn't say \"crashed\". It was more like we \"hit the stopper so hard, we all fell over onto our faces\". But, hey, at least we stopped. And that was a bonus. However, we started to spin. \"We're spinning!\" Dad said. So we were on a spinning platform. Great. We finally stopped. I could hear a heartwarming Christmas song over the intercoms, one that I particularly did NOT enjoy. \"Shh,\" Shannon said, cocking her head. \"Do you hear that? The bell!\" She jumped down from the train and onto the platform. \"What bell?\" my dad asked, he, the boy and I following her. \"The sleigh bell!\" Shannon answered as if we all heard it. \"Sleigh bell?\" the boy asked excitedly. She pointed to one of the various openings in the room. \"It's coming from that tunnel!\" We followed her to the tracks that led to this tunnel. They overlooked an icy ravine that did not look the least bit friendly. \"That's the way we should go,\" she said. And then she started walking across the tracks! With every step she took, I took a sharp intake of breath, hoping she wouldn't fall off. \"Come on!\" she called to us. \"Wouldn't it be safer to sit down and scoot across?\" I asked. \"But this way's faster,\" she said. Dad and the boy followed what she did, but I went with my technique and sat down, sliding across. And Shannon was wrong about her way being faster. I frequently had to wait for the little boy to get a little ahead of me so I wouldn't run into him. We all, luckily, made it off those deadly tracks okay (although all of us had at least one little slip-up). We followed the tracks outside and wove our way around the little elf apartments and under the little elf bridges. \"We're lost,\" Dad said when we stopped at a mini tunnel. \"We're Madeline lost in prison,\" I muttered to myself, quoting my dad on a future thing he would say about that movie. \"Yes,\" Shannon said. \"What, you're admitting we're lost or that we're Madeline lost in prison?\" I asked. \"Yes, I hear it,\" she said. \"I hear it, too!\" the boy said. \"I don't hear anything,\" Dad said, shaking his head. I looked at him. \"That's strange, cause…I don't, either.\" \"Okay, it's down this way!\" Shannon said, not really caring. \"Are you sure?\" Dad asked. This made her stop and turn around. I thought she'd totally bite his head off, but instead, she said, \"Absolutely.\" And so we followed her into the tunnel, not knowing where it would lead.[Chapter 17] I apologize if I didn't spell \"Neumatic\" right...I can't spell that word... CHAPTER FIFTEEN: THE LAST PRESENT The tunnel led us into a building. We went down a flight of tiny metal stairs, trying to be quiet. \"Why can't Lucy and I hear anything?\" Dad asked. His voice echoed, and it came out louder than he had intended it to. \"Shh!\" Shannon put a finger to her lips to signal everyone to be quiet. The landing of the stairs led to a walkway overlooking a ton of high-tech equipment. Surrounding it were some elves, and in the center of the room was a huge globe and hundreds of TV monitors displaying kids sleeping in bed. The elves started to talk about a last-minute present. I guessed they wrapped it wrong or something, cause one elf--who seemed to be in charge--started freaking out. Then they said that it was going to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Dad gasped. \"That's my town!\" he said. \"I'm from Grand Rapids!\" \"That's where I live, too,\" I wanted to say. But I stopped myself. I couldn't give these guys that much information. What if one of them went looking for me sometime soon? They wouldn't find me, because I didn't, technically, exist yet. A buzzer sounded, and the elves found a kid whom was apparently labeled \"naughty\". They let him slide this time, but the head elf said \"to put him on the check-twice list next year\". Then they all jumped into something they called the \"Neumatic\". They said it was \"the only way to get to the square on time\", which probably meant they were heading the same place we were trying to get to. As soon as they were out of sight, we made our move. We got into one of the cars of the…whatever it was, and off we went. It was pretty fast--so fast, I thought my hair was going to fly backwards. When we got out, we arrived at a strange site. We were in a room with a conveyor belt going down the middle. On either side were big bolts of wrapping paper. \"I don't hear it,\" Shannon said, a bit depressed. She turned to the boy. \"Do you?\" He shook his head. \"No.\" Dad looked at the conveyor belt and then at us. \"I think we should follow those arrows,\" he said. Shannon and the boy looked a bit skeptical. \"Well,\" I said, realizing Dad needed some support, \"why not? It won't hurt trying.\" He gave me a grateful smile, and off we went down the path of arrows. *** When we came to the next room, all we found was more conveyor belt and a bunch of weird devices. Nothing else. No exit. Not one sign. \"I…I thought there'd be a way out,\" Dad confessed sheepishly, knowing we were lost. \"We're gonna miss everything,\" Shannon complained. I looked at her. \"Hold it. Now, maybe this didn't get us where we wanted to go. But at least he tried. He's been trying the whole night.\" I glanced at my dad. \"And that's all I could ever hope for.\" Shannon seemed a bit taken aback, but before anyone could say anything else, a loud buzzer sounded. We got off on a couple of nearby landings so the conveyor belt wouldn't move us any further. A present wrapped in red-and-white-stripped wrapping paper made its way to the conveyor belt. \"Hey, look! A present!\" Dad said. He looked carefully at it as it rode by. \"It's going to my town. To someone named Billy.\" \"My name is Billy!\" the boy said. \"It's going to 11344 Edbrook Avenue,\" Shannon read. \"That's my address!\" Billy said. He looked at the present, and then at us. He grabbed onto it, going through a passage to another room. Well, we weren't going to let the poor kid go off by himself, so we followed him through the passage…and to the hugest indoor slide I've ever been on. It went SUPRE FAST! And I guess I was lucky to be going down on my behind, because Dad and Billy went down on their stomachs, and that must have been scarier, going headfirst. After the slide, we slid down a big funnel, kinda like the ones at the mall where you drop coins in. However, instead of going into a black hole, we landed on a huge pile of presents. \"Look!\" Billy said excitedly, still holding his present. \"It says, 'Merry Christmas Billy…from Mr. C'!\" Shannon said. Billy shook the package. \"I think I know what it is! I've wanted one of these my whole life!\" He was about to open it when I noticed something. \"Hold up,\" I said, and pointed to another note on the package. \"Look what that says. 'Do not open until Christmas.'\" \"But…but…\" Billy said, a bit dejected. \"Those are the rules,\" Dad said. We started moving suddenly. I noticed for the first time that at the foot of the pile there was a red bag. And then I knew. This was Santa's bag full of toys. And we were right on top. And if someone discovered us…we'd be in huge trouble.[Chapter 18] OKAY SO LIKE I WAS JUST ON YOUTUBE FOR MY POLAR EXPRESS FANFIC AND I SAW SOME VIDEOS AND APPARENTY MILEY CYRUS IS SUPPOSEDLY DEAD???!!! SINCE WHEN?! IS SHE SERIOUSLY DEAD OR WHAT?! IF ANYONE KNOWS, PLEASE TELL ME!!!!!!!!! I KNOW THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY, BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND LIKE I REALLY TRUST ALL THAT TABLOID CRAP. LET ME KNOW! I'LL APPRECIATE IT! ~ElphieThroppDG28[Chapter 19] Sorry about freaking out about the whole Miley Cyrus deal. I guess it wasn't real...sorry... - CHAPTER SIXTEEN: OUT OF THE FRYING PAN, INTO THE FIRE After that, everything went very quickly. Somehow, a blimp-like vehicle of elves, picked up the bag of toys--with us in it--and lifted us up off the warehouse floor and into the air. We flew over the little houses and could see a bright, shining tree in the distance. The view was absolutely breathtaking. And, for once, all was right with the world. So, obviously, something had to ruin it. That something happened to grab Billy by the leg and try to pull him deeper into the pile of presents. \"Something's got me!\" he cried. Shannon, Dad and I all got ahold of him. He clung to his present, pure fear reflected in his brown eyes. He would have let go of that present, but…you know…I think it was his first present from Santa. And…I understood that. \"On three!\" Dad said. \"One…two…three!\" We pulled, but whatever had him still hung on. \"It's still got me!\" Billy said. \"On three again!\" Dad said. \"One…two…three!\" We were able to pull Billy, the present, and…who else? Eddy. \"You!\" Dad exclaimed. \"You?!\" Eddy answered. \"What are you doing here?\" Shannon asked. \"Same as you: I'm checking on my Christmas presents! I wanna make sure I get everything on my list! All I found was one present, and all it had was a bunch of stupid underwear!\" \"Serves you right,\" I mumbled. \"Look!\" Dad said, pointing below. We had made it to the big, shining tree. \"Hey,\" Shannon said, \"it's still five-to. I think we're gonna make it!\" \"Of course we will!\" Eddy put in. \"It's been five-to for the last hour! We got plenty of time! We've got nothing but time! We have time to kill!\" \"You know what?\" Dad asked. \"I don't think we're going to make it!\" He was right. We seemed a bit too close to the top of the star on the tree. So some elves jumped off the vehicle and sky-dived to the ground. It was pretty cool. And they were so cute with their little parachutes! \"We're still not going to make it,\" Dad said to me. He was right. We knocked that star right off that tree. Luckily, more elves jumped off and saved it before it could do any real damage. And then we landed on the sleigh. \"Thank goodness, we stopped moving!\" I breathed a sigh of relief. But that didn't last very long. \"All right, you stowaways,\" an elf said, sticking his head over the edge of the sack. \"Party's over!\" \"I was just following them!\" Eddy insisted, trying not to get in trouble. \"We fell in here by mistake!\" Dad pleaded. \"Forget about it!\" another elf said. \"We knew you were in there the whole time!\" They helped us out of the sack and…onto it…I guess. \"So that nobody gets hurt, here's how we're going to get you down…\" a third elf started. \"Aw, this is simple,\" Eddy said, pushing his way to the front of the group. \"Why, I know--\" \"What do you know?\" the elf asked him. \"You're not supposed to be here in the first place! But since it's Christmas…I'm going to let you slide .\" The elves kicked Eddy's heels, and down he slid. He landed on his feet beside the conductor. \"I've been looking for you,\" he told Eddy. Next was Shannon. \"Nice to see you again,\" the conductor said. Next was Dad. \"Cutting it kind of close, don't you think?\" Next came me. \"We're just full of surprises, now, aren't we?\" I rolled my eyes and took my place next to my dad. I noticed that poor Billy had to give his present back. But I was sure that he'd get it soon enough. Then there was a big roar from the crowd of elves. We all turned to the big doors on our left, and I knew what was coming: It was time for Santa to make his appearance.[Chapter 20] Hey! Um...I apologize if I don't get my facts straight. I'm not a very keeps-her-facts-straight kind of person, and I'm sorry if I can't...it's a weakpoint I have. But I will try my best. Um...and sorry about the whole Miley Cyrus deal again. She's not dead, some idiot decided to spread a rumor around that she died in a car accident or something. So, don't worry. She's fine. P.S. The chapter title...got that from Charlie the Unicorn (which I do not own). Enjoy! - CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: SHUN THE NON-BELIEVERS They brought out the reindeer first. They were very, very jumpy, and I silently giggled to myself. Those reindeer could take out those elves if they weren't careful. They lined up the reindeer in front of the sleigh, but didn't hook them up. Then I saw why. They brought out the harnesses and that kind of stuff next. And lining that stuff were silver bells. The elves shook them, and everyone cheered. But…something was wrong. My brow furrowed as I cocked my head to hear the bells. Maybe my hearing wasn't as good as I thought it was. Or maybe everyone was being too loud. But I slowly realized after a few seconds that it had nothing to do with the former or the latter, and had everything to do with…something else. And that something else was preventing me from hearing the bells. \"Aren't those bells the most beautiful sound?\" Shannon asked us. Gee, I wouldn't know…I can't hear them! I looked at Dad, and he looked just as frustrated as I felt. He shook his head, indicating he couldn't hear it, either. Well…at least I wasn't alone. After the reindeer were hooked up to the sleigh, it got really, really quiet. And then we all started singing. \" OH…YOU BETTER WATCH OUT…YOU BETTER NOT CRY…YOU BETTER NOT POUT, I'M TELLING YOU WHY…SANTA CLAUS IS COMING…TO TOWN!\" The doors on our left opened, and Santa Claus came out. Or…at least, from what I could tell, he did. All those annoying little elves started standing on each other's shoulders, blocking my line of vision. I was about to push them over, but that would have been very rude. So I stayed where I was. Dad was having the same problem I was. He kept jumping up and down, trying to see Santa. But the elves were too tall for him. \"He's here!\" Shannon squealed. \"He's here!\" \"Where?\" Dad asked. \"I see him!\" Billy pointed. \"He's over there!\" I wasn't listening now. I had stopped trying. No matter how hard I tried at something, it always ended up in failure. Always, always, always. The conductor was wrong. I still didn't believe in Christmas. I still couldn't hear those stupid bells or see stupid Santa. I still hated Christmas with a burning passion. \"I can't see him,\" I said to myself. Then I said it louder. \"I can't see him.\" \"I CAN'T SEE HIM!\" my dad shouted, no one but me hearing him. \"I CAN'T SEE HIM!!\" \"Join the club,\" I said. But then Dad's attention went to the sleigh. He followed something that fell into the air, and then on the ground right by his feet. He picked it up and shook it in his ear. One of the bells. It had fallen off the sleigh. Dad kept shaking it. I thought I heard the bell whisper Doubt…doubt…doubt… \"Okay…okay!\" Dad said, almost crying. \"I believe.\" He said it a bit firmer. \"I believe.\" And now he whispered it. \"I believe.\" He shook the bell again. My face broke into a smile. Dad continued to shake the bell in his ear, a big smile on his face. And I knew. He finally heard it. He believed. \"You hear it?\" I asked him. He nodded. \"Yeah. Do you?\" My face fell when I realized what my answer would be. I had been so busy being happy that my dad finally believed, that I hadn't figured out until now that I still couldn't hear anything. I tried to say something, but nothing came out of my mouth. No sarcastic remark seemed good enough to fit the moment. And what was more, I couldn't seem to make one up at all. And as I realized this, the person I had been for all thirteen years of my life--the person that loved to hate Christmas--sort of…melted away. Like the Winter Warlock in \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\". The person who was revealed after that was a person I was surprised that I knew. She had been trying to work her way out of me the whole time I was on the train. She was trying to turn me into the person I should have been thirteen years ago. The person I was trying to be for the remainder of my life. Okay...so maybe the conductor was right after all. Maybe I wasn't the same person. But even if I had transformed, I still didn't hear that bell. I shook my head. \"No,\" I said. My dad's smile disappeared just as fast as mine had. \"You don't?\" I shook my head again. \"No…but it's okay,\" I said, trying to keep my voice level. \"I mean…you can hear it. And…that makes me happy that you can. I don't need to be able to hear Santa's sleigh bells or whatever. It's fine.\" \"It's not fine,\" Dad said. \"We went through all that…and you still can't hear?\" \"Seriously. It's no big deal.\" I fought to keep my tears back, knowing that if at least one escaped, more and more would follow it. \"Maybe not…but, still,\" Dad insisted. He looked at me and put the bell in my hand. \"Come on. Just…close your eyes and open your mind. Please. Just…believe.\" I squeezed my eyes shut and hoped against hope that this would work. I opened up mind and thought as hard as I could, I believe…I believe…I…believe… I shook the bell, and the sweetest ring I've ever heard came out. Dad and I looked at it and then at each other. It had finally worked.[Chapter 21] CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: THE FIRST GIFT I honestly had so much trouble containing the joy that suddenly welled up within me. I believed! I really believed! After thirteen years, I finally believed! Dad turned around suddenly, and there, in front of us, was Santa Claus himself. I was just like, Whoa… I mean…it was SANTA. And if you meet Santa in person…well, you're kind of at a loss for words. \"What was that you said?\" he asked Dad in his low voice. I noticed that besides his red suit and beard, he was…glowing. \"I…I believe,\" Dad stuttered. \"I believe.\" He looked at the bell and back to Santa. \"I believe that…this is yours.\" He handed over the bell. Santa took it and looked it over. \"Well…thank you.\" He suddenly turned to me. Now I was like, Snap, he's going to bust me for hating him for thirteen years. \"Hello, Lucy,\" he said. \"Um…hi…\" I said, a bit nervous. \"I understand you've recently…changed.\" I stared at him. How did he know? He laughed. \"I'm not accusing you. I just wanted to say congratulations. It takes a lot of courage and self-perseverance to undergo that kind of change, not to mention accept it. And it also takes a lot of courage to help those you care about most.\" He winked at me and smiled. It took me a few seconds (Hey! I'm really slow on the uptake sometimes!), but then I realized that he knew. He knew about me and Dad. Whoa. I guess he DID know everything. \"Me! Me! Pick me, Santa!\" Eddy called. \"Shh!\" Shannon hissed. \"What are you doing? Stop it!\" \"Pick me! Pick me! I want the First Gift!\" I giggled. Unlike me…some things never changed. \"Young man,\" Santa said to him. \"Patience. And a…smidgen of humility might also serve you well.\" It took all my energy to not start laughing. \"Yes, sir,\" Eddy said. Santa turned to Shannon. \"And you, young lady. Lady of decision. Full of confidence and spirit… Christmas Spirit. Keep up the good work.\" \"Thank you,\" she said quietly. Santa then turned to Billy. \"And Billy…it is Billy?\" Billy nodded. \"I see you made some new friends.\" Billy looked at all of us. \"Yes, sir, I sure have.\" \"You're a lucky lad. There's no greater gift than friendship.\" He turned to the crowd of elves. \"And speaking of gifts…let's have this young fellow right here.\" He pointed at my dad. Dad's eyes bugged out of his head as the crowd began to cheer. He turned to us, his mouth open. I laughed and gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. \"Take a picture, it'll last longer,\" I said jokingly. He was carried up by some elves. He climbed into the sleigh tentatively and stood by Santa. I couldn't hear them, because they were so far away, but I had a feeling what my dad was asking for… And, sure enough, about a minute later, Santa held up the bell that had fallen off the sleigh. \"THE FIRST GIFT OF CHRISTMAS!\" And then the crowd roared once again. I felt some tears run down my face as my smile grew and grew. But I didn't stop them this time. Because instead of the tears being from frustration and pain…they were from the joy I had in my heart. We heard the clock start to ring. It was midnight. It's about time… I thought. Dad climbed down from the sleigh and made his way back towards us. Obviously, since he got the First Gift, Eddy wanted to talk to him and everything. But Dad ignored this. He smiled at all of us and then gave me a hug. \"Whoa…\" I said, caught off-guard. \"What's this for?\" He let go and smiled. \"I believe…that I forgot to commend you for finally believing in Christmas.\" I couldn't help but smile. \"Well…I believe that I forgot to do the same for you, mister.\" I don't know what made me do it, but I kissed him on the cheek. \"Wow,\" Eddy said. \"Are you two together or something?\" We turned to each other and recoiled. \"Oh, ewwww!\" the two of us said together. And then we all laughed. It was finally time for Santa to leave. We watched him fly around the square a few times before disappearing in a cloud of Christmas magic. Some of the magic dust floated down, looking just like snowflakes. \"It's everything I dreamed it would be,\" Shannon said. \"Could all this be nothing but a dream?\" Billy asked me. I smiled and turned to Dad. I nodded, telling him he was the one to answer that. He gladly answered the question with the following: \"No.\"[Chapter 22] CHAPTER NINETEEN: MORE TICKETS AND A HORRIBLE SURPRISE Well, we left the elves to celebrate Christmas in their funky, upbeat way. I suppose the conductor wanted to get us back home, even if time was altered. We waited patiently in line for the conductor to punch our tickets. Some elves brought the missing train car back, collapsing on the ground from exhaustion. Dad started laughing, but then Shannon looked at him, and he stopped and cleared his throat. I giggled. \"All right, you,\" the conductor said to Eddy. \"Tickets, please.\" He punched more holes into the ticket and gave it to Eddy. Eddy held it up. \"LEAN,\" he said, unsatisfied. \"Whatever that's supposed to mean!\" \"LEAN is spelled with four letters,\" the conductor said, taking the ticket back and showing it to Eddy more carefully. \"I believe I punched five.\" Eddy snatched it back. \"Hey, are you saying I don't know how to--Oh, I'm sorry. It says LEARN. My mistake.\" He climbed on the train as the conductor said, \"Lesson learned .\" Billy was next. When his was done, it said DEPEND ON. He flipped it over, and it changed to RELY ON. He flipped it over one more time, and it said COUNT ON. Billy was truly amazed. \"That is some special ticket,\" the conductor said. Billy looked up at him. \"It sure is.\" \"So…can you count on us to get you home safe and sound?\" Billy looked at us. \"Absolutely. Me…and my friends.\" I almost started crying again. Billy considered me his friend! He was so cute… Shannon was after Billy. Her ticket read LEAD. \"It says LEAD,\" she said, a bit confused. \"Like lead balloon.\" \"I believe it also is pronounced lead . As in leader, leadership… lead the way.\" He saluted her. \"I'd follow you anywhere, Ma'am.\" She smiled and climbed on the train. And then it was my turn. After my ticket was done being punched, it read PERSERVERE. I shrugged. \"Alrighty, then…\" I said. \"Don't you wanna know what it means?\" the conductor asked. \"Does it mean I need to persevere and keep believing in the Christmas Spirit?\" The conductor was at a loss for words. I smiled. \"I thought so.\" I suddenly realized: Dad. He hadn't gotten his punched yet. I quickly made my way to my seat and opened the window. \"Ah, yes…\" the conductor was saying. \"The man with all the questions.\" The conductor took his ticket and punched it behind his back. Dad was a bit nervous, not knowing why he did that. When he got it back, it said BELIEVE. \"It says BE--\" The conductor stopped him. \"It's nothing I need to know.\" I smiled and shook my head. Only he'd say that. Dad got back on the train, and everyone crowded him. \"Show us the bell!\" everyone said excitedly. And then I remembered something Dad told me and Susan one year. He told us that Santa had found the bell on the seat of his sleigh and gave it back to him as a wrapped present the next day. But Dad had thought it was gone. And all because he put it in the pocket with the hole. I sighed. Something had to go wrong, didn't it? Sure enough, when Dad reached into his pocket, his fingers stuck out of the hole. \"It's gone,\" he said sadly. \"I lost it. I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.\" \"Don't worry! We'll find it!\" Billy said. \"Yeah! All of us!\" Eddy piped up. \"Yeah, let's hurry up and find it right now!\" Shannon said, getting up. I noticed Dad didn't even make a move to get up. Why was he just sitting there? Didn't he care? The train jerked forward, and we were too late. \"We're too late,\" Shannon said. \"Gee…\" Eddy said. \"That's really too bad. Really.\" Shannon sat next to Dad. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. It made me feel horrible to see him like that. And even though I knew he'd get it back…I still couldn't stand to see him so sad. And he stayed that way for the rest of the way home.[Chapter 23] Hola! Yes, I have been pushing myself to get as much of this done as I can (without rushing...). I'm probably going to post more tonight...I've been on the computer since seven, working on this. So...yeah! I guess you can expect this to be finished tonight or tomorrow! Until then...happy reading! CHAPTER TWENTY: SAYING GOODBYE \"Next stop: 11344 Edbrook,\" the conductor said into the intercom. \"I repeat, next stop: 11344 Edbrook.\" Billy got up and hugged me. \"See ya around?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Yeah, you will.\" \"Where ya going?\" Eddy asked him. \"Home.\" \"Oh. Merry Christmas.\" Billy stopped at Dad and Shannon's seat. \"Thanks for stopping the train for me,\" he said, shaking my dad's hand. Shannon hugged him. \"Have a wonderful Christmas, Billy,\" she said. Billy got off the train and ran into the house. \"Look!\" Shannon said. \"Santa got to Billy's house already!\" Billy ran out to the front porch and held the familiar present up triumphantly. \"Look! Santa came!\" he called to us. \"Isn't that amazing?\" Shannon asked rhetorically. \"It is amazing,\" I heard Dad say. I was a bit tired by then, and I tried fighting the sleep I knew was coming on, but I had to close my eyes for just a minute and… ... \"Hey, you!\" Eddy said, shaking me awake. \"What?\" I asked him groggily. \"I was sleeping!\" \"Your boyfriend's getting off the train!\" \"He's not my-WHAT?\" I cried. Sure enough, Dad was going to his front door. I jumped up. I had to say goodbye to him! I turned to Eddy and stuck out my hand. \"No hard feelings?\" I asked. He shook it. \"Nope. Merry Christmas.\" \"You, too.\" I hugged Shannon. \"You're pretty cool,\" I said. \"Thanks. You are, too. Merry Christmas.\" I nodded and hurried off the train. \"Hold it!\" the conductor said. \"I don't believe this is your stop.\" I sighed. \"I…I need to do something first.\" I turned to look at dad. \"He's…he's my dad.\" The conductor suddenly nodded, and I guess he remembered me and why I was on the train. He stood aside, and I ran like the wind. \"DAD!\" I yelled. \"DAD!\" He turned around and was ready to catch me as I held out my arms. When we let go, he asked, \"Couldn't leave without saying goodbye, Lucy?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, a bit out of breath. \"I just wanted to say…I'm sorry about the whole…bell…thing…\" He nodded. \"Thanks. But…I think it'll work out…maybe Santa will find it…or…something…\" \"Well, I wanna say…thanks.\" \"For what?\" I hugged him again. \"For making me believe.\" \"I didn't do that. You did.\" \"But you helped,\" I pointed out. \"That's true.\" \"ALL ABOARD!\" the conductor yelled. \"I'd better go,\" I said. \"I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.\" \"Yeah,\" Dad said. \"You know how mad he gets…\" We both laughed, and then Dad and I hugged again. \"Merry Christmas, Dad,\" I said. \"Merry Christmas to you, too, kiddo,\" he said. I pulled away. Only my dad knew to call me that. Well...my grown-up dad, at least. So...that meant... \"You know?\" He smiled and nodded. \"I've known for a while now. When you called me 'Dad' the first time, I thought you were out of your mind. But…when we shook hands…I kind of…felt it. And then as time went by…I knew.\" \"Well, truthfully…I never though my dad would be my best friend.\" \"Same with me. I mean…with you…not…my dad.\" I hugged him for the last time that night. \"I know. I love you, Dad.\" He hugged me back. \"I love you, too, sweetie.\" We waved to each other, and I ran back to the train. The conductor yelled \"Merry Christmas!\" to him, and then I saw Dad wave to someone on the roof. I knew instantly: the hobo. I sat on the steps until we got to my house. When I looked back in the train, everyone was gone. Only me and the conductor remained. We stood in front of my house. \"I have a question,\" I said. \"Why…why, whenever my dad told me to do something…I had to do it?\" \"Fatherly instinct,\" the conductor explained. \"When you called him 'Dad', his fatherly instinct kicked in. But since he technically wasn't a dad yet, it malfunctioned and made you do whatever he told you to.\" \"Then that explains the hobo!\" \"What?\" I shook my head. \"Nothing.\" I looked at him. \"Thanks for making me get on the train.\" \"Like I've told your father: one thing about trains. It doesn't matter where you're going. What really matters is deciding to get on.\" I nodded. \"That's some good advice.\" He took out his pocket watch. \"We still have some time. Do you wanna see how it turns out?\" I frowned in confusion. \"How what turns out?\" \"Don't tell me you wouldn't like to see if your Dad gets his bell back.\" My frown disappeared. I nodded. \"I'd like that.\"[Chapter 24] CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: A TRUE CHRISTMAS MIRACLE We were suddenly standing in a familiar-looking living room. My dad and my aunt Sarah were on the floor, in the midst of wrapping paper and various Christmas presents. I realized I was standing in my grandparents' living room, and it was the next day. Christmas Day. \"Aw,\" I said the conductor. \"They look so happy.\" A thought hit me. \"They can't see or hear us, can they?\" \"Nope,\" he said. \"Hmmm…\" I kicked the nearby couch. Instead of my foot going through it, it bashed into it. I think I left a dent in that couch, because my foot hit it pretty hard. \"Ow!\" I said, hopping on one foot. \"I said they couldn't see or hear us. I didn't say we were able to pass through things.\" I sighed. Then something caught my eye. I dove under the tree, and there, under a piece of wrapping paper, was a small box. It looked just like the one Billy had. Only smaller. I picked it up and shook it. I faintly heard a bell inside. I smiled. \"So this is how he got it back,\" I said. I put it next to Dad, hoping he'd notice. He didn't. But, luckily, Aunt Sarah did. \"Hey, look, Chris! Here's another present!\" she said, handing it to him. \"It has your name on it!\" He looked at it, confused, and then opened it. I will, honestly, never forget his face when he pulled out the bell and shook it. He let Aunt Sarah shake it, and I could tell that she, too, heard the bell. There was a note on the bottom of the package. From where I stood, I read what it said: Found this on the seat of my sleigh. Better fix that hole in your pocket. - Mr. C. My grandmother-my dad's mother-came into the room. I could see that she was still pregnant with my Aunt Cindy. \"Oh, what a beautiful bell,\" she said. \"Who's it from?\" \"Santa,\" Dad told her, letting her see it. \"Santa? Really?\" she asked skeptically, shaking it. \"Oh, that's too bad.\" I looked at the conductor. \"Wait. What's too bad?\" He nodded back to what was happening. \"Be patient.\" \"What's this?\" Grandpa asked, coming into the room. He shook the bell. \"It's broken. Sorry about that, Sport.\" \"They can't hear it, can they?\" The conductor shook his head. \"Because…they don't believe.\" The conductor nodded again. Grandma and Grandpa left, and Aunt Sarah followed them. My dad sat a moment longer, looking at the bell. Then he looked around the room, stood up, and shook the bell. \"Merry Christmas, Lucy,\" he said, putting the bell down and walking out. ... By the time we were back outside my house, I was already crying. It hadn't stopped snowing, and it was still midnight, but I didn't really notice. \"He is so GOOD!\" I said between sobs. \"He's the best dad anyone ever had!\" \"You'd better run along back inside,\" the conductor told me. \"You wouldn't want Santa passing your house, now, would you?\" I wiped my face with my sleeve and headed in. \"MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" the conductor shouted. \"YOU, TOO! THANKS AGAIN!\" I called back. The hobo appeared on the roof and waved at me. I waved back, and watched him dissolve in the snowflakes. I got to my bed and fell asleep immediately. ... \"IT'S CHRISTMAS!\" Susan shrieked, running through the house. \"WAKE UP, LUCY! IT'S CHRISTMAS! MOMMY AND DADDY SAID THAT YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME IF I WANNA OPEN MY PRESENTS!\" I woke up and looked out the window. Train tracks on the snow. Interesting… I got out of bed and went downstairs to open my presents. Susan opened all of hers with one swipe, but I took longer (because I'm not skilled in the art of opening presents as she is). \"Hey! Look! Here's another one!\" she said, and I had a sudden case of deja-vu. \"I think it's for you!\" she said, handing it to me. I took it. It was the exact same box I saw my dad with. I shook the box. He didn't. I opened the box. Oh, yeah. He did. Inside was a silver bell, just like Dad's. There was a note on the bottom of the box: Dear Lucy, like I've told your father, this bell is an excellent symbol of the Christmas Spirit. I figured, because you now believe, you needed one, too. Just remember: the true Spirit of Christmas lies in your heart. - Mr. C. P.S. I do hope your father fixed that hole in his pocket. I laughed and rang the bell. My dad came in at that moment. \"I had the most bizarre dream,\" he said. \"I was back on the Polar Express with you, Lucy, and-\" He looked at the bell, and then at me. \"You weren't-\" \"Oh, yeah,\" I said. \"I was.\" He looked confused. \"But how-\" \"Let's just say that conductor isn't blind when he knows a certain gene's being passed down in the family.\" My dad smiled. \"I knew it was only a matter of time.\" Then my mom came in. \"Oh, Chris,\" she said. \"Don't tell me you got another bell…\" \"Santa gave it to her!\" Susan said, handing Mom the bell. \"And Lucy rode the Polar Express!\" My mom shook the bell. \"Sweetie…it's broken,\" she said, giving it back to me. \"I keep telling him not to buy cheap junk at the hardware store.\" \"It's not cheap junk,\" I said, hugging her. \"It's real Christmas magic.\" She looked at me, and then at my dad. \"Who are you and what have you done with Lucy?\" \"She's changed,\" Dad said simply. \"Well…whatever you did, Christopher…it worked.\" She hugged my dad. \"And I'm proud of you.\" I realized that maybe they wouldn't get a divorce after all. And that was the best Christmas present I got that day.[Chapter 25] I'd just like to thank everyone who read and reviewed this story! Your support has been amazing and y'all rock! Happy Holidays! - EPILOGUE: JUST BELIEVE As years went by, I went along with my dad to visit his friends when he went ice fishing. They all remembered me from the strange dream they had where I accompanied them on the Polar Express, but my dad and I insisted that they had wild imaginations. After all, I wasn't even born yet… I never again rode the Polar Express. Two years after my adventure, stayed up until 11:55, hoping it would come around. It never did. I figured, after two disappointments, that I only needed one ride, anyway. I already believed. My mother never heard the bell. I tried many times to help her hear it, but she refused it. So I figured it was better to leave that kind of thing alone. All my friends at school couldn't hear it, either. They were too busy showing each other their new iPod nanos and touch-screen phones they had gotten. But I didn't bother with them. It was too late to get them to believe. Eventually, Susan was no longer able to hear it, either. She's slowly starting to get the sound back, but it will take a long time before she will hear the full effect again. As for me and dad, well…we always hang our bells, side-by-side, every year. And we are able to hear them as clear as the first time they rang for us. Susan and I are now grown-up with families of our own, and Mom and Dad are kinda old (but not so old that they're senile). Dad tells my kids, nieces and nephews the story of his ride on the Polar Express, me chipping in some information now and then when he forgets. One of my sons, Jess, is a bit skeptical about the whole thing and doesn't believe the train actually exists. I just laugh and share a smile with Dad, because I know that he will soon experience the full power of that magical train. All he has to do…is believe.[Chapter 26] DEDICATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Yes…it's that time again to thank the following people who helped me with this story: -Everyone in The Polar Express .
