A chilling wind fluttered into the room, stirring the dust and causing the bottom of her skirt to drift around her knees. And yet the windows were all sealed tightly. Her eyes drifted towards the dull curtains that were motionless. 'There must be a draft coming from the door,' she thought, trying to ease her mind. The impassive room had seemed to call to her with a solitary noise and had drawn her in. Now it seemed to fence her in, each object, concealed by off-white drapes, seemed to be reaching out at her, creeping in and ready to ambush her. She grew distressed as paranoia set in and she started to rapidly pull and tug at the drapes, while telling herself that they were just silly items; they couldn't move! Breathing heavily from her outburst her eyes darted around the room, searching for anything out of the ordinary. Just a coatrack, a dust coated bookshelf and an old desk with what seemed to be a jewellery box sitting on top of it. 'See, Grace. Nothing out of the ordinary, just some silly things that the previous house owners must not have wanted,' she sternly told herself. She shook her head at her own foolishness. The wind picked up and whipped her golden hair around her shoulders and into her face. It seemed to laugh at her, it quiet moans tormenting her. Her fears were immediately brought back to life and tears pricked at the back of her sky blue eyes, blurring her vision. She scolded herself for crying and becoming so scared, she was a grown woman for heaven's sake! Grace took a deep breath; trying to collect herself. She turned and wandered towards the window, the sky was a blanket of grey and the rain drenched the outside world and cascaded down the glass creating trails of water until they converged with the bottom of the windowpane. She planted her hands firmly upon the windowsill, supporting herself while she let out a shaky breath that caused the chilly glass to fog as she rested her forehead against it. Pushing herself from the refreshing coolness she looked out again, prepared to see the bleak and miserable garden that she still needed to tend to, but the outdoors had become sinisterly dark; she couldn't even distinguish anything past the droplets of aqua. Before she turned away she caught sight of movement, but not from outside; it was a reflection. She turned cautiously, unsure of what she might find. Nothing. The frosty air seized her by surprise and caused her to gasp noisily. It bellowed into her ears and sent shockwaves down her and made her golden tresses fly in every direction. It snuffed out the candlesticks she'd lit, enclosing her in complete darkness. A ghostly melody, almost like a lullaby used to sooth babies, floated over her. Her eyes drifted close for a moment before she caught herself. From the corner of her eye she caught a glimpse of light; she ambled towards the soft glow and found what she once assumed to be a jewellery box was in fact a music box. The graceful twirling figurine of a ballerina stood magnificently in the middle. The music stopped abruptly, and the lid of the music box slammed shut. She hurriedly clutched it and tried to pry it open, not wanting to be in the black abyss that had suddenly turned bitterly freezing. The arctic wind cackled around her once again, jerking and yanking at her hair. She then heard the most petrifying thing. Somehow over the deafening gusts she'd heard the unmistakable echo of a lock softly going 'click'. She'd left the key in the other side of the door.

They did not kill or shut out Adam after his outing. Good, to be fair it was a little bit awkward first but hey, in the end they managed quite well. „Come on, it can't be that bad man\" „Yeah, just spit it out\" Chris took a deep breath. Come on, get through with this, and just tell them. He sighed. \"Well, you know that Rachel and I broke up because she moved to Canada because of her job, and she said something to me that kept me thinking the last months since she is gone.\" \"What did she say?\" \"I wanted to keep up a long distance relationship but she just smiled and said that won't work out in the end and I should use the chance to get myself together and admit who I really love and act on it. Well, I probably get now what she meant.\" Nick and Ortu just looked at him questioningly till Ortu reacted. \"Oh, Jessica? I mean she is a bitch and I really thought you were finally done with her but if you love her, well that's fine, we might get used to her someday.\" Chris rolled his eyes and sat down. \"No, not Jess and she also moved if you had not noticed by now.\" He rubbed his temples, fighting down the forming headache by doing so. Ok, let's try this differently. He looked at his two friends again. \"Why'd you think Adam isn't here with us?\" \"Because he's at a family dinner?\" Nick answered, stating the obvious. \"Well, yes. But why do you think did I choose this day to meet with you guys and tell you something really important?\" Ortus face started to show realisation. He looked at Chris, through the room at pictures, stopping at one of Chris and Adam hugging and smiling into the camera, then his look got very thoughtful again, some kind of confusion and finally he looked straight at Chris again, eyes wide and hit by complete and utter realisation. He jumped up, making the chair fall with a loud thud and shouted. \"NO WAY!\" Nick was so shocked he fell off the couch he was sitting on. \"What's going on? What the hell got into you?\" \"Don't you get it? Nick, Chris wants to tell us that he is in fucking love with Adam!\" Nicks head turned to look at him and Chris could almost see his brain working. \"Is he right?\" Nick pointed at Ortu still standing right beside him. \"Yes\" \"So your gay too now?\" Chris sighed his headache was definitely coming. As if there wasn't something else than gay and straight… \"Well I'm not interested in you or any other guy, as far as I know. Just if your starting to be afraid of your asses again. And I still think women are hot. Remember I had some very well working out sexual and normal relationships with some of them. And I wasn't unhappy or missing anything back then. And don't even think about mentioning Jess now.\" Nick closed his mouth that he just opened to exactly do that. \"So, just Adam then.\" Ortu said and finally sat down again. \"Just Adam\" Chris confirmed. \"Well, you're in some deep shit then.\" \"I know.\" \"Adam won't make it easy because he will be afraid of what will happen to your friendship and our group, especially after last time and you don't know if he even likes you as much too.\" \"Well at least he tried to kiss me once, that's a good sign, isn't it.

A young man by the name of Jesse Evans grows up, gets married to the girl of his dreams, goes to work in his home town and ends up meeting a girl that sparks some sort of interest in him, not romantic but he has no idea what. The girl is tall, lanky and somewhat simple minded. Her hair is blond and frizzy. It's clean and kept but still somewhat fly-away. Susie is smart in a simple sort of way. Acts as though she's been sheltered from society all her life. She's very naïve and almost doesn't recognize people she's met just a day ago. One day Jesse invites his mother to join him for lunch at his place of business. They meet in the Cafeteria and sit down with this girl named Susie. Jesse introduces Susie to his mother and is about to tell his mother a little about her, when his mother sees her and goes nuts. His mother flips out. She begins to cry… frantically, she points at the girl as she backs up. The only thing his mother knows to do is turn and run. Susie acts as if nothing has even happened. She doesn't remember who Jesse is let alone the frantic behavior of his mother. Toward the end of the day, Jesse asks his boss for the rest of the afternoon off and drives to the home where he grew up, where his mother, divorced, still resides. He knocks, no answer, he enters, no one seems to be home. He moves around the house calling out, \"is anyone home?\" No answer. He finally nears his mother's room and can hear her crying. When he enters her room, his mother is frantic and doesn't know what to say to him, knowing that he'll probably just tell her that she's being mental. She explains her frantic behavior to him. That the girl that he introduced to her at lunch, Susie, is in fact… her long dead daughter. Of course he doesn't believe her and does in fact tell her that she's being mental. When the girl, Jesse's sister Susie, died many years ago, she, his mother, suspected that something wasn't right and for years after and had bouts of imagining that her daughter was still alive. They watched her die. They'd buried her. They were there when she was taken to the hospital. A supposed autopsy was performed, diagnosis, heart failure. A condition the young girl had supposedly been born with. They, Jesse's mother and father, were told that she wouldn't live. Susie lived until she was four. She died in 1970. Jesse was eight and was hardly old enough to understand what had happened. And he had another brother, what was the big deal? Fast forward twenty-five years. Jesse meets this strange girl, who to fill his position in the file room when he left after going to law school, to move up to a more prominent and more affluent position. The girl of his dreams finished school a year later and they get married. Linda got pregnant with their first and life went on as usual until that strange day. Jesse was close to his old boss and that was how he had met Susie. When Jesse left the job, Pepper needed someone to replace Jesse. It wasn't a difficult position and Susie, being simple minded, was pretty safe doing the job. His old boss, Pepper, was the perfect boss, old, light hearted, jolly, care free and worked well with anyone he met. Everyone loved him. Susie worked out fine. Pepper was glad to be able to give her a job and treated her like a daughter. Jesse and his co-worker Bob, had sat down to lunch with her several times. She couldn't remember that she'd even met Bob they day before, let alone remember Jesse's name. It was amusing but they were both nice guys and didn't let her simple mindedness bother them. Jesse had questioned her a-couple of times. She didn't seem to remember much about her life prior to going to work where Jesse worked. Jesse put it to the back of his mind assuming that she just couldn't remember because she couldn't remember much anyway. Jesse had often joined his mother for lunch being that they didn't live far from each other. They usually went out someplace. Jesse was strapped for time one day and asked his mother to meet him in the company cafeteria for lunch. She agreed. That was when Jesse introduced his mother to Susie. That was the first day, of the rest of his life. A mother knows her daughter, even if she hasn't seen her for twenty-four years. Jesse's parents were divorced about a year after Susie's death because of the whole situation. Jesse and his brother fared well all things considered. Jesse got through high school, joined the Army, stayed for six years, got out and went to school. He spent six years in school, four of which was just ordinary college, getting his Bachelors degree, and then two more years of Law School in Chicago where he eventually passed the bar and became a Lawyer. Jesse's brother was considerably younger but ended up going to college as well before becoming a no-mad and living like a hermit in the mountains. Linda, the girl Jesse married went to school in Indiana and became a linguist specializing in German, though she could speak several different languages. She graduated the following year. Linda was smart and convinced Jesse to get a DNA test to prove to his mother that Susie was not his sister, her daughter, and his mother would hopefully come back to Earth. Some how they convince Susie to agree to the test. Their blood is analyzed over a period of about a week. Jesse and Linda are eating dinner one night when the doctor who authorized the whole thing, called. Linda answered the phone. Now in the mean time, Jesse's wife Linda, went into labor. His boss recognized the nesting signs that Jesse was explaining and alerted Jesse to the fact that she was about to go into labor, which she did shortly thereafter. They had a beautiful baby girl that they named Jessica Evans. Jesse wondered if what he told Linda that night threw her into labor. She assured him it was not, she was due any time. \"Jesse, the DNA test was positive.\" \"What?\" The doctor reiterated, \"The DNA test was positive, you were a match, the DNA test proved that you and Susie are brother and sister \"Linda goes over to Jesse, she puts her arms around him. \"Susie and I are brother and sister.\" A girl who died twenty-four years earlier was in fact, his mothers daughter.

Do you know how fast life can flash through your eyes? No? Well, it flashes very quickly. One day you be sitting on a park bench having fun with your friends, and the next minute or could have become a murder. I know I've been there. It's sad isn't it? That one minute you could be a sweet little girl with plans to go on an adventure to get away from a family that doesn't take notice to you. Than the instant you step foot off that front porch and take a cautious step into the new life, you find yourself in a field of weed, lying on your back with a sweaty pig lying on top of you. You plead with him to let you go. You beg for him not to do what he's thinking. The next minute your dress is up and there is pain between your legs and the 'man' above you are grunting and oinking like some sweaty fool, just brought him slop. That's how it was for me. That was my first time. I was only thirteen and I was on an adventure. All I wanted to do was get away. I wanted to get away from my drunkard father, and my mother (who couldn't give a right damn about me if I was the president himself.) I wanted to go to Las Vegas, become a millionaire and move far away. I wanted to on with life have bigger and better things. But that was not what happened for me. Instead I met a man. He took me to a place far away before I had to get outta his car. He had me swindled. But what could I have known I was only thirteen. I called him a name and for the first time in my life I missed my father's drinking. His threat was real. He's through me through the windshield if I called him it again, but too this day I can't remember what it was that I said to him. I just know that I had to get outta his car or I'd be in a world of trouble. So, I got outta his car and I walked and walked until the sun went down and I was too tired to stand. I got off the road and lie on the hill and fell asleep, only to be woken in the morning with to an odd lady pissin' in my hair. She was a lovely lady. Later, I would think of her as the mother I wanted, even though she wasn't the sort one wanted in a mother. The part that got me was that she cared. I wanted to stay with her; I wanted to be with her. But when that dream ended I headed back home. I wanted to be free of the adult like. Now I knew what to expect when I finally got out in the world and I tell you I was not lookin' forward to it… But, then I got the nerve up to call home.

On the outside, I looked like how I always did - sure, tough, and set in everything I did and said. But inside, I was this close to a train wreck. I looked up to see Rosa entering one of the rooms and I uncrossed my arms, slowly letting my guard down. I looked down at my hands which I placed neatly in my lap, my mind whirring hundreds of thoughts. Why had I come here? Of all places I could have gone, I went to my troop leader's house. It seemed like a good idea when I asked my chauffeur to drop me off at Mrs. Neffler's tonight but now... \"Chika? What's wrong sweetheart?\" Mrs. Neffler asked as she shuffled toward me in her fluffy marabou slippers. My head snapped up at her words and I quickly rose from the couch, letting my arms fall into their regular crossed manner. \"I better go - it was stupid of me to come over here,\" I told her as I began heading toward the door in a huff. \"Oh no,\" she said, \"sit down, let's talk.\" I hesitated for a few moments, tempted to take her up on her offer. Then I could hear the little voice in my head telling me, No don't do it. She won't understand at all. Besides she's just your troop leader. I headed up the small flight of steps leading to the main hallway, holding back my anger and tears as best as I could. My breaths gave me away though. \"I better go,\" I mumbled as I lowered my head close to my chest. \"Well at least wait until I call your parents to pick you up,\" she called after me. That sentence made me freeze and suddenly I spun around and it all came out. \"My parents are in Monte Carlo!\" I blurted out as my arms came uncrossed. I heard my voice quiver during the delivery of that sentence and I knew it was only a matter before my guard came down completely. \"...Well I guess it will be a while before they get here,\" Mrs. Neffler replied as she smiled faintly at her attempt to make a joke of her earlier statement. I looked down at the floor and threw my hands up in the air. As I raised my gaze from the glossy floor, tears began to blur my vision. \"It was a last minute trip...they didn't mean to leave me on my birthday.\" At these last words, my hand went up to my face to cover the streams of tears flowing freely from my eyes. I choked out gasps of air as I sobbed, letting all of my bottled emotions out. Then I heard the clip, clip, clip sounds of Mrs. Neffler's marabou slippers moving toward me and I soon felt her arms wrap around me. My head leaned against her chest and I wrapped my arms around her for support as I cried. One hand stroked my hair and her chin rested on the top of my head. \"I'm sure they didn't,\" she replied. I heard another voice in the background, probably Mrs. Herman, whispering to Rosa about this news. Mrs. Neffler patted me on the back and continued to support me as I cried. \"I'm sure they love you very much,\" she added. Then I heard Rosa come up to Mrs. Neffler and say in a hushed voice, \"Just give me 10 minutes.\" \"Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you,\" Rosa and Mrs. Herman sang as Rose carried some kind of cake in a basket toward me. I smiled up at Mrs. Neffler, silently thanking her for this. I heard footsteps behind me in the midst of everyone singing to me and Jenny, Mrs. Neffler's daughter, slid in beside me with a big smile. \"Happy Birthday dear Chika. Happy Birthday to yooouuu!\" everyone sang. Mrs. Neffler carried out the last note longer than the rest which made me smile just a little wider. I leaned in, both of my hands keeping my hair back from the flames, and blew until the last candle went out. I straightened up to a round of cheers and clapping from Mrs. Neffler, Jenny, Mrs. Herman, and Rosa. And this time, I let my guard stay down because this is the best birthday ever.

Le ciel gris, rideau tombé sur ce spectacle macabre, semblait pleurer la perte de ces êtres autant que les chérubins dont les yeux avaient présentement autant d'éclat que le firmament morne de ces derniers jours. M'étant rendu sur ces lieux après l'incendie, je pus voir de mes yeux les étages détruits par le feu. Les bureaux disparates avaient purement et simplement disparu, laissant place à la cendre, maintenant principale habitante de la ruine. Les piliers autrefois superbement ornementés, devenus décombres, enrichissaient l'impression de destruction pourtant déjà bien présente. Sur le sol, des objets épars et brisés me donnèrent à ce moment les larmes aux yeux. Il est bien des choses que l'on peut briser, trancher, découper. Tout le monde sait qu'il est bien plus simple de détruire que de construire. Je prends pour exemple la lettre qui me fut envoyée par Sarah, impératrice de mon cœur, qu'un autre a eu la chance d'épouser. Cette lettre m'annonçait deux choses, l'une entraînant l'autre : la rupture entre nous et l'effondrement de mon bonheur, de mon univers. Il est également étonnant de pouvoir apercevoir une infime partie de la puissance des mots, et de comprendre la subtilité de celle-ci. Les mots, ce sont des navires, des vaisseaux nous emmenant loin de notre petite condition humaine, que cela soit vers un ruisseau de bonheur ou un typhon de cauchemars. Les mots sont selon la personne, un doux remède pour les peines en tout genre, ou des couteaux que nos lèvres affutent à loisir. A force de réflexions et de tournures, ils peuvent transmettre presque n'importe quelle émotion, que le visage ne sait pas forcément retranscrire malgré sa panoplie de métamorphoses. Je vais donc tenter de vous faire comprendre, cher lecteur, les sentiments qui m'assaillirent lorsque je trouvais les vestiges de la résidence appartenant à des gens qui furent mes amis de toujours. Quand à la fin d'un livre, un personnage que vous appréciez grandement tire sa révérence de par sa mort, vous pouvez légitimement vous sentir trahi, ébranlé par la tristesse (pour peu que le livre en question soit poignant). Ce fut mon désagréable sentiment, que la fine bruine à mon arrivée accentua, bien que je pensais ma douleur déjà au-delà du supportable. La serrure de la porte, craquelée, me fit penser à l'état de mon cœur fendu, en deuil. Cette affliction me toucha du plus profond de mon être, et un tel chagrin laisse toujours des marques sur tout ce qu'il touche, tel un petit enfant sale et espiègle prompt à quelque fantaisie déplaisante. Quand j'entrais dans ce manoir, chaque bruit, fût-il infime, devenait pour moi une note d'espoir éphémère, une espérance de quelconque rescapé bien vite déçue par le silence qui redevenait rapidement le maître des lieux. J'inspectai chaque pièce, chaque recoin de la demeure et tentait de me rappeler la formation des meubles, l'aspect des chambres avant le drame. En vain. Mes efforts se heurtaient à un mur que ma mémoire peinait à détruire. L'on aurait dit qu'au lieu d'être cachés, ces souvenirs avaient été annihilés, laissant place à un vide gênant. Comme si rien de tout cela n'avait jamais existé, et que l'histoire de ce triste lieu débutait dans les flammes de la destruction. Dans la chambre à coucher des parents, je trouvai, stupéfait, un livre par terre. Comment avait-il pu réchapper de ce bouleversement, je l'ignorais. Le titre était néanmoins effacé, mais peu importe, je savais qu'il valait le coup de le lire. Vous êtes en droit, cher lecteur, de me demander le comment de cette affirmation confiante à l'extrême. La réponse est simple : rien de ce que lisait mes amis disparus n'était médiocre. Les rares moments où la vie m'amenait en coups de vent chez eux furent les plus joyeux de ma vie. Je les revois encore souriants et, voyant que je n'avais pas le temps de m'attarder, m'amener un ouvrage que je m'empressais de lire dans mes temps libres. Dans chaque roman d'aventure, ou presque, il y a le côté lumineux et le côté des ténèbres, vous l'aurez remarqué. Et des deux côtés, il y a toujours le chef et ses idéaux, entouré de ses acolytes. A partir de cela, l'écrivain peut les faire évoluer dans l'univers qu'il s'est construit, et décider de la victoire de tel ou tel côté. Vous n'êtes pas sans savoir que généralement, c'est la Lumière qui l'emporte, et une fin heureuse lui succède. Il est pourtant des écrits qui se terminent mal, très mal, et l'histoire de mes compagnons en est un, à mon grand désarroi. Pour eux, la dernière page du livre est atteinte, et le point final sonne dans mon esprit aussi froidement que les cloches après l'enterrement de leurs corps calcinés. Ne vous est-il jamais arrivé de vous dire que les personnes chères à votre cœur, une fois mortes, méritent la plus grande sépulture du cimetière ? Cela peut paraître un tantinet égoïste, mais plus tard l'on met ça sur le compte de la douleur du moment. C'est ce que je pensais quand je vis la tombe. Je me suis longuement recueilli, mon cerveau fonctionnant avec fièvre. Pourquoi eux, et non une maison abandonnée ? Accident ou crime prémédité ? Il me paraissait pourtant impossible que des gens comme eux, se rapprochant le plus du terme \"d'ange\", puissent avoir eu des ennemis dans le passé. Ce fut sur ces entrefaites que je partis. Je ne pouvais malheureusement pas revenir de suite chez moi, je n'en avais pas la force. En marchant je vis alors un banc aux allures providentielles. Je m'y posais, et observais de mes yeux embués de larmes les divers passants. Connaissez-vous cette impression ? La sensation d'être observé par un inconnu qui ne vous fait pas ressentir de la peur, mais plutôt de la curiosité ? Que ce soit par une tempête de neige en hiver, où dans une allée ornementée des feuilles tombantes d'automne, le sentiment est le même. La première question qui vous vient à l'esprit est presque toujours la suivante : \"Pourquoi cet individu m'observe-t-il de la sorte ?\" Pourquoi... Une question éternelle, où les hypothèses sont très souvent de mise. De votre oeil averti, vous aurez remarqué que l'on pose cette interrogation à des gens qui souvent ne sont pas plus avancés que nous. Demander \"Pourquoi\" est-il une donc manière de se prouver que l'on n'est pas le seul dans les ténèbres ? Car la réponse que l'on attend généralement est \"je ne sais pas\", ou \"aucune idée\". C'est mon avis. Et enfin, ce fut moi l'observateur, celui qui détient les réponses, celui qui scrute, celui qui sait. Je pense enfin, après avoir poussé mes réflexions, que le pourquoi d'une telle attitude peut trouver des dizaines de réponses. Une simple envie de mélancolie et de calme, le plaisir de ne rien laisser nous passer sous le nez... Ou peut-être pour se poser, réfléchir et trouver une source de malheur plus grande que celle qui nous assaille dans les situations les plus catastrophiques selon notre jugement. J'espère vous avoir un peu éclairé sur mes sentiments, cher lecteur, et vous avoir donné envie de lire la suite. Malheureusement, le temps passe, le vent souffle, et je me meurs... Mais je m'éteins non sans laisser un dernier sourire de délivrance, unique héritage de ma part laissé à ceux qui verront mon dernier souffle transformé en buée. Le brouillard s'épaissit, mes yeux se troublent ; ma vision du monde est faite, je peux partir serein... Adieu donc cher lecteur. Mon corps retourne à la poussière, que votre joie demeure... … ","Summary":" Du haut de ma maison, je pouvais apercevoir trois rues plus loin le manoir qui récemment avait brûl"},{"Movie":"Others","Title":"Diary of Jane  Breaking Benjamin","Author":"OutlawedAngel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6212130","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Diary Of Jane – Breaking Benjamin If I had to I would put myself right beside you So let me ask Would you like that?

Elle me raconta simplement les mots d'insultes et les imprécations que ses bourreaux lui lançaient, véritables couteaux que leurs lèvres affutaient à loisir. Mon interlocutrice décrit l'effet que lui faisaient ces lames, avec des mots qui encore font tomber mes larmes. Mais revenons donc au commencement de ce récit qui, je l'espère, vous entretiendra de certains constats que j'ai réalisés sur les profondeurs insondables de la tristesse, ainsi que de l'ampleur des malveillances humaines qui jamais ne cessent. Comme je l'ai dit, cette histoire est celle d'une femme en devenir. Pour ne point consigner son nom, je nommerai ladite demoiselle Night. Bien, commençons donc. Il est des choses dont il devient nécessaire d'avoir un certain âge pour les comprendre. En ce monde, par exemple, les enfants ne font pas toujours la différence entre écouter et entendre. Night, d'une maturité précoce, avait pourtant compris la nuance dès son entrée à l'école primaire. Car trop emplie de différences selon ce jugement hâtif si propre aux enfants de son âge, la brise de ses vaines protestations fut balayée par la bourrasque de rejets qui s'ensuivit. Tous les matins, son supplice commençait une fois la porte de son appartement passée. Dans la nuit n'arrivant pas encore à son terme, elle cheminait vers l'institution portant le nom de celui qui s'était mis en tête de la rendre obligatoire les yeux de la jeune fille indiquant sans sous-entendu que les murs de ce bâtiment possédaient des airs de prison avant l'échafaud. Toute la méprisable action était réglée comme du papier à musique. Alors que le soleil honorait notre partie du monde de ses premiers rayons, les regards inquisiteurs tournés vers Night devenaient rapidement goguenards. Et sans sommation, les serpents crachaient leur venin inlassablement, ayant trouvé une cible à défaut de la tranquillité de leur âme en peine. Night avait pourtant toujours espéré une paix éphémère pendant les cours, durant lesquels elle aurait pu sécher les larmes qui gâchaient la beauté de son gracieux visage, composé de traits harmonieux, de jolis yeux bruns, et orné de cheveux de la même couleur recouverts d'un bandeau. Malheureusement, la place qu'elle occupait au centre de la pièce faiblement éclairée s'était rapidement transformée en pilori, sous l'œil même du professeur qui ne se trouvait là que pour les beaux yeux de sa fiche de paie. Et Night, petite fille alors, n'avait pour seule amie que la solitude, dont les serres refermées sur son âme ne cherchaient qu'à saper le peu de volonté qui se cachait au fond de ce corps frêle. En milieu de journée, parmi les cris et les jérémiades des bambins et des adolescents en devenir, Night mangeait assise seule à une des tables de la cantine avec l'entrain du condamné qui consomme sa dernière pitance. Du moins, elle avalait ce qu'il restait après que certains mécréants eurent imposé leur taxe devenue quotidienne. Petit à petit dans son esprit, chaque rire, chaque sourire devenait moqueur et visait sa personne. Elle avait appris en ce milieu hostile que se débattre ne servait à rien, tant on l'ignorait. Night était entrée dans un cercle vicieux auquel elle ne trouvait aucune échappatoire. Mais – et notez que cela me stupéfia – elle gardait espoir. Et ce fut cette espérance qui l'empêcha de jouer le jeu de ses nombreux ennemis. Elle savait que leurs mauvaises paroles n'étaient que fariboles jetées à la va-vite pour satisfaire un besoin de supériorité. Malheureusement toute agression, mentale comme physique, fait souffrir et laisse des marques. Au fil du temps, Night devenait plus méfiante et n'arrivait plus à accepter l'idée qu'un jour, quelqu'un l'accepte comme une amie. Ce fut le commencement d'un renfermement sur elle-même. Mais si la souffrance et le fait d'être la proie des quolibets apportent une chose, c'est l'humanité. Night essaya toujours d'aider ceux dans le besoin qui acceptaient de lui parler (bien que sa méfiance lui eût empêché une confiance optimale en ceux qu'elle consolait). Et jamais elle ne perdit ce sourire dont il est compliqué de trouver plus franc. Après des années de souffrance vint le temps du collège. A ce stade l'on peut penser que la situation pourrait s'arranger, mais il n'en fut rien. Car Night découvrit d'autres types de souffrance durant cette période, notamment l'hypocrisie et la tromperie deux faits qu'elle proscrirait plus tard de la liste de vocabulaire qu'elle ne comprenait pas. Night donc, à son entrée en sixième, avait dans un élan d'optimisme prudent espéré que les temps avaient changés. Peut-être pourrait-elle enfin avoir des amis ! Mais vous l'avez compris, elle déchanta vite… Ses anciens « camarades » avaient pour ainsi dire laissé entendre à tout le collège que Night ne possédait pas une once de qualité. L'on connaît évidemment la rapidité d'une rumeur au sein de ces établissements. Et Night se retrouvait encore seule et plus meurtrie, les coups qu'elle continuait de recevoir se faisant de plus en plus violents. Les amis qu'elle crut se faire l'abandonnèrent en vitesse, profitant d'elle au passage, abusant de la confiance qu'elle leur accordait. On lui prit tout. Une partie de sa famille alla même jusqu'à l'insulter. Et si vous ne savez pas ce que l'on ressent lorsqu'on est calomnié par des proches, vous ne pouvez même pas l'imaginer. On se sent blessé au cœur même de la forteresse que l'on s'est construite et l'on se dit, avec une colère et une tristesse passagères, qu'on ne peut compter que sur soi-même. Mais la solitude n'apporte que plus de solitude, il faut se battre – ce qu'elle fit – et faire le premier pas vers les autres s'ils ne viennent pas vers nous. Et Night le savait plus que quiconque, mais aucun effort ne portait les fruits qu'elle attendait impatiemment. Elle trouvait du réconfort une fois chez elle seulement, plongée dans la tonne de travail quotidienne que lui donnaient ses professeurs. Mais elle fit une rencontre… ","Summary":" \"L'histoire que je vais vous apprendre appartient à une jeune fille dont les vertus sont aussi nom"},{"Movie":"Others","Title":"Love Is No More","Author":"DragonQuill6913","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7587970","Passage":"[Chapter 1] AN: So this is kind of a random little fic that bit me while I was trying to get back to sleep. But whatever. It's basically what Henry went through when Danielle's identity was revealed to him, why he sent her away. I saw her and my heart leapt with joy. I rushed away from my parents, to my beloved Contess du LoungCra. I took her toward my parents, inquiring delightedly, making certain that she was not engaged to any man. I was in rapture, I did not see that she was trying to stop me, that she did not wish to come before all these people. And then that witch stepped out of the crowd. She stepped forward, with her cruel leering Contess du LoungCra was not who she claimed to be. The witch named her Danielle, and called her naught but a face, and accusational finger, aimed at my Contess. And then she proceeded to proclaim, that the servant girl. And when I turned to my tearful darling, surely weeping because of the dreadful untruth of these claims? and I asked her if it was true… when she said that, \"I am who she says.\" my heart broke, I am certain, into a thousand pieces. And then it truly began, for the shards of my heart assembled into an army, with a brave commander, dressed all in blood red and pure white. But my mind sent out an army of its own, and a cruel commander, wearing black, and a tan the colour of parchment. And even to this day I remember seeing them clearly, with my inner eye, for it had seemed as though time froze while the armies assembled, and for the battle after. For then, inside of me, an army of white and an army of black clashed against one another, mind and heart battling each other for rule. And as the armies fought their commanders argued, and it seemed, as one commander won the disagreement, so did his army succeed in the battle. So I focused my attentions upon the commanders. \"He loves her! And she him! Is that not reason enough?\" The commander of the heart cried out and the mind spoke harshly back, sounding like cold truth at its finest. \"No! He is the prince! He has a duty to his country to wed to advantage!\" \"But it is love; they are destined for each other!\" \"Not is he is to do what is right, what his father tells him to do!\" The hearts argument began to sound weak, desperate, like a man losing his last hope. \"But what of love? True love...\" And then the cruel mind scoffed, and the black army seemed at once to demolish the white, and then they rushed upon the commanders, and beat down the commander of the heart, and bound him up and away, to some prison. And then I came back to my senses, time returned. I released myself of Danielle - for I knew who she was now, a deceiver, a liar – away from me. I replied harshly to her pleas. I said whatever I could to hurt her most, to get her away from me. I couldn't bear to look at her anymore, she was the reason my heart, my soul, felt so dead. I couldn't handle it. I would marry the princess of Spain.

Ok, they're twins, they're together since the womb, but they used to make awkward things, like sleep and take shower together. More than twins, they were soulmates. But he respected the situation and learned to love Theo as well. After Theo and Isabelle's parents discover what happened in the house when they were not in there, Isabelle tried to kill herself and the boys in a dramatic scene just like the movies she used to watch. Matthew woke up terrified with the gas smell: What the hell are you doing? Why do you want to kill us? My parents know everything. I told you what I would do if they discover what happens between me and Theo. How do you know this? They were here, Matthew. Isabelle started to cry a river and thought that her life was devastated. Matthew was comforting her and feeling a little guilty; he was an intruder in the family and in the house. Maybe all this tragedy could be avoided if he had not accepted the invite to live with them. Theo woke up with Isabelle's hiccups. He was always very spaced-out with other people's feelings and thoughts, but this time he felt that something was very, very wrong. He knew what was happening. In the middle of despair, he started to think about leave the house, disappear in the city. \"Matthew will take care of Isabelle\", he thought. But he remembered how dependent of him the girl was. And he was dependent of her. He can't remember one moment in almost 20 years that they're apart. However, they were scared with all the situation and feeling lost. Their life changed very fast and they were not able to deal with the consequences. Then Theo decided to give his oppinion: I think that we should go ahead with Isabelle's plan. Matthew was looking at him with the worst expression ever. Do you mean suicide? You think that we have to run away from this dying? Isabelle was not crying anymore, the look in her eyes was blank and Matthew guessed her reaction. She always agreed with Theo's ideas. Matthew remembered everything that they lived together in the last weeks. He was a foreigner in Paris and found in the twins a way to feel comfortable in those chaotic days in the city. He was in love with Isabelle, she was the girl of his dreams. He was happy untill that moment when this and all his other dreams started to crumble and he was not right if he wanted to sacrifice his life to these people. After all, people are just people. And it was such a complex situation and he was not responsible for it, he was not feeling guilty anymore. Sorry, I don't want to do this. Isabelle sat on his side and tried to persuades him: Matthew, we have to be together till the end. You said that you love us, remember? Theo and I would do anything for you, you know that. We hope that you would do anything for us too. Theo was staring them with some smirk. \"He is the weirdest person in the world\", thought Matthew. \"It's not normal a person acting like this in such a terrible situation.\" Matthew thought about his family in America, his friends of university, his studies, his future. And decided to go away. His heart was bleeding, but he knew that he should respect his life. Isabelle freaked out. Matthew, don't go, don't leave us now, please! On the other hand, Theo was not showing any emotion about it. But in the last moment he said: Let him go. He's not one of us. Gave shelter to this dumb American was the worst idea we ever had. Matthew take his stuff and decided went back to the hotel he was in the beggining. While was walking on the streets, he was thinking if Theo and Isabelle were going to concretize their death plans. What a drag. But I can't come back and avoid this. It was an unexpected and sad end to a beautiful history. Time to face the reality. The dream is gone.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own this poem. Shadows of Doubt – By Neal Shusterman In the blink of an eye, you might suddenly feel That your world's been invaded by all things unreal. They slink up behind you, and don't make a sound, But there's nothing to fear... if you don't turn around. In the pit of your stomach, there rests a device That can calculate how fast your blood turns to ice; It measures the temperature the nightmares will start, Then divides it by beats of a terrified heart. At the foot of your bed lies a blanket of fear, You might think it quite safe, but it's always quite near. When its steel-woollen quilting wraps 'round you one night, You will learn that it's not only bedbugs that bite. At the top of the stairs there's an attic I've found, That remained even after the house was torn down, And it's filled with the cobwebs of lonely old dreams. Which have grown into nightmares that swing from the beams. At the mouth of a cave lives a shadow of doubt; If you dare to go in, will you ever come out? Are there creatures who lurk where it's too dim to see? Can you hear when they move? Are you scared yet? (Who, me?) At the edge of the earth flows a river of fear, And it pours in to space day by day, year by year. As you shoot the cold rapids, and stray far from shore, Do you notice your lifeboat has just lost an oar? In the eye of the storm stands a ghost of a chance, And around her all spirits are destined to dance. She turns a cold a cold gaze toward an unlucky few – Don't dare to look now, for she's staring at you. At the end of the world stands a giant steel door, And what lies beyond it, nobody's quite sure... Is it crystal-clear heavens, or night blazing hot, And which is more frightening: knowing or not? In the face of the future we fly on our own, Hoping our wings never turn to stone. If you fall from that sky to the sea, will you drown? Well, there's no need to worry... unless you look down. At the back of your mind, there's a hole open wide, Where the darkness is creeping in from the outside. You can light rows of candles to cast the dark out, But it's always there hiding... ... in shadows of doubt. ","Summary":" This is a really good poem I thought I would share with you!

He had been up late the night before so he was dreading the thought of sitting through the whole school day and not falling asleep in the middle of it. He survived through his two morning classes before his lunch break during which his friends Marissa and Melanie were talking about the school dance that was happening later on that night. Jared was not planning on attending because he found social gatherings with a lot of people he doesn't know extremely uncomfortable. So he allowed his friends to talk about the dance and said nothing for the rest of the lunch period. He slept through his French class with no concern as since he was already fluent in the language he was not worried about his sleeping impeding his success in the course. After his nap he felt awake and refreshed and breezed through his next and last class of the day. After class he went straight home, he made a habit of doing this as he felt there was no point in staying in a place with people he didn't know and/or care about. On his way home in the bus he said nothing to anyone and just stared out the window the whole ride until he got home. When he got home he went straight to his room opened his laptop and started to browse the internet and stare at FB, a new social networking website. He was about to close his computer and go downstairs for food when he heard a slight ring come from his computer. He looked back at his computer and saw that Marissa was messaging him. He opened the message and she told him he had to go to the dance with her. He said no initially but after a small procession of begging on Marissa's part he said yes and got ready to go to the dance as it started in thirty minutes. Once back inside the school he could hear the loud music emanating from the cafeteria-turned dance hall. He walked across the school foyer and entered the room and saw a large amount of people dancing. \"Dancing\", describing what they were doing as dancing amused Jared as he was a dancer and what he did looked nothing like what he was seeing. He scanned the room and after a little while found Marissa and Melanie dancing, Marissa with a partner, and Melanie by herself. Upon seeing him Melanie grabbed Jared and started dancing with him. Being his ex-girlfriend from a year prior the two had come to become friends and so Jared thought nothing of it and started dancing. After a while they stopped and Melanie and Marissa found new partners. Jared looked around the room and saw some girls from his French class that he talked to so he walked over and said hi to the group. They talked for a little while and then as the song ended he said his \"see you later\" to the group. But as he was turning around to leave the group to his right he saw something that made his heart stop, a beautiful girl with purple eyes and an even more beautiful smile. Jared smiled at her and awkwardly sped walked away as he was afraid of embarrassing himself in front of her. On his way back to his friends he could not help but constantly look over his shoulder at the girl. When he arrived at his friends location he bumped into one of them because he was not paying any attention to what was happening in front of him and was still staring at the girl. \"What's wrong?\" Marissa asked. Jared paused for a second, paying no attention to Marissa. \"Jared, what's wrong?\" Marissa repeated with a hint of concern in her voice. \"uhmmm… Nothing… I'm fine, why? What's up?\" Jared responded, barely paying attention to his friends or their increasing worry for his unusual behavior. \"You're acting a little weird… what did you see?\" asked Melanie. \"A girl… I don't know why… but I really want to talk to her… and my chest feels a little funny…\" Jared said, still barely involved in the conversation. He felt a quick gust of wind behind him and then felt a hand slap the back of his head. He tucked in, placed his hand over the area he was just hit by his ex-girlfriend, and turned around to face her. \"What the hell was that for?\" he asked. \"Don't scare us. We thought something was wrong with you, you dumbass!\" Melanie exclaimed. \"Sorry, wasn't paying attention.\" \"Anyways go and talk to her!\" \"WHAT? Why would I do that I'll just embarrass myself and she'll think I'm an absolute idiot. I'll just pass this up as indigestion.\" \"You're an idiot.\" Melanie stared, clearly annoyed, \"Just go over there. Even if you don't talk to her you know the people she's with. That might help.\" She then turned him around and pushed him in the girl's direction. After she stopped pushing him he started to walk over by himself. He stood beside the girl and stared talking to the group, still very conscious of how close he was to her and also conscious of how nervous that made him feel. After a while a small circle opened up in front of the stage where people were going in and dancing. Jared decided to enter it a dance with another break-dancer he met recently named Patrick. After a while the circle dissipated and he returned to the girls group. He again made sure he was standing beside the girl. Almost right away the girl turned to him and said, \"Does your mom work at Valtruse Hospital?\" Slightly taken aback he looked at her and said, \"Yea…\" She then said, \"Uhm, is your name Jared?\" Even more surprised he said, \"Yea, how'd you know.\" \"You probably don't remember me but we met at a volunteering thing in grade 9\" His eyes opened up and he remembered volunteering with a girl and her sister. He said, \"Yea I remember you, we volunteered with your sister at that hospital picnic. But… sorry I forgot your name. I'm terrible with names…\" \"I'm Claire.\" She said with a smile. After that they started talking about what happened between the years they hadn't seen each other and Jared thanked the gods that something like this happened. After what felt like ten minutes of talking he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He pulled out his phone, opened and looked and, much to his dismay, saw a text message from his mother saying she was there and waiting for him outside. He turned to Claire and said that his ride was there and that he had to go. He went found Marissa and Melanie, told them his mom was there and that they should come with him if they wanted a lift home. While walking away he looked back and saw the girl. He bottled up all his courage and walked back over to her and asked for her e-mail address. She gave it to him and then she hugged him and they said their good-byes. He dropped off Melanie, then he dropped off Marissa, then went home. He fell asleep thinking about Claire and how he wished he could have talked with her longer… ","Summary":" If Asked I'll Lie By: Ilias Heartstringz McTaggart ( IHM ) Part 1 The bell rang at West Brooks High"},{"Movie":"Others","Title":"Historia de un corazón que latía en código morse","Author":"Ecorie","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6529351","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Mathilde duerme.

Se arrebuja en el gastado uniforme que podría haber sido su salvación y se convirtió en su condena. El barro ha transformado su tela grisácea en unas prendas tan deprimentes como el cielo. Manech alza la vista. Una densa neblina cubre el sol; una densa neblina cubre su vida. Pero Manech es fuerte, Manech es feliz. Al menos, una pequeña parte de él. Esa pequeña parte que nunca deja de pensar en Mathilde. Mathilde. Sonríe. Por muy lejos que esté, por mucho tiempo que haya pasado, la sigue queriendo igual. Su mano sigue latiendo con la misma intensidad que cuando reposaba sobre su pecho aquella cálida mañana. Debería parecerle lejana, ajena; debería deprimirse. Pero tan solo sonríe más. Con cada recuerdo, su figura incorpórea se dibuja junto él, le susurra a cada minuto esas tres palabras: Mathilde aime Manech . Se frota los ojos con esa manopla roja que desentona en aquel lugar tan carente de vida, el corazón que aún late en un campo lleno de muertos, el niño que hace un muñeco en plena ventisca de invierno. Trepa por la pared de tierra hasta alcanzar el borde del hoyo que se ha convertido en su refugio. Un aire gélido golpea su rostro desnudo, camuflado de un marrón grisáceo que oculta su tono preocupantemente pálido. Como siempre, no hay moros en la costa. Los soldados están descansando en la ilusoria seguridad de sus respectivas trincheras, unidos por el miedo y separados por una absurda frontera. Manech se pone en pie a duras penas, cargando con el cansancio, el frío, el hambre y el peso de sus heridas. Sin embargo, parece darle igual. Por su mente sólo ronda una idea. Anoche vio ese árbol solitario en medio de la devastada pradera, a tan solo unos metros, llamándole con esa suave y dulce voz tan añorada en la guerra. Saca su navaja mientras camina, paso a paso, hacia el tronco desnudo. Acaricia la corteza durante unos instantes, mientras obliga a su cuerpo a recuperar unas fuerzas que no se ha parado a pensar si podría necesitar. Es perfecto , se dice. La ausente armonía en su curvatura, su naturaleza muerta, la fuerza con la que se mantiene a pesar de las bombas que amenazan con arrancar la tierra. La hoja comienza a tallar la superficie rugosa de la madera. Finas líneas irregulares se adivinan, poco a poco, en el pequeño claro libre de corteza. Se sume completamente en su tarea mientras, de nuevo, desfilan bellos pensamientos por su cabeza. Mathilde soñando, Mathilde besando, Mathilde riendo. Por unos momentos, sus temores son aparcados. Pero aparece el Albatros. Lo oye antes de verlo. Su vuelo raso proclama a voz en grito la furia de ese extraño pájaro mecánico. Manech se detiene y le mira. Esboza una sonrisa y viaja. Se encuentra de nuevo en el campanario, junto a Mathilde. Sus brazos rodean la pequeña cintura y, sobre los suaves hombros, deja reposar su cabeza. Con delicadeza, le susurra al oído palabras bonitas mientras ella acaricia sus grandes manos. De pronto, sus labios se detienen. \"Mira\", y señala el albatros. Mathilde sigue la dirección que indica su brazo. Durante unos minutos, los ojos de ambos contemplan su vuelo calmo. Él cierra los ojos. Ella se suelta, se gira y deposita un beso en sus labios. Manech abandona la calma de los ojos cerrados. El avión ya ha pasado. Dispuesto a seguir con su tarea, le dedica una última mirada. Pero la máquina vuelve, asesina. Él no es consciente. Alza una mano y saluda, sin olvidar su sonrisa. Esta vez ni siquiera escucha volar las balas. Duelen. Acribillan. Manech siente cómo escapa su vida. Mathilde se revuelve en su cama. Abre los ojos y, con dificultad, respira. Una respiración de jadeos ansiosos que buscan un poco de aire en esa habitación en la que el sol ya no brilla. No ha sido la luz, ni el calor, ni tampoco una pesadilla. Mathilde se ha despertado porque sabe que algo no va como debería. No necesita reflexionar para averiguar qué es lo que ha pasado. Inspira. Piensa. No, no ha ocurrido. No está muerto, lo sabría. Sólo algo ha cambiado, su rumbo ha virado tanto que el hilo que nos unía no ha podido encontrar otra salida. Pero las palabras de consuelo no convencen esta vez ni a ella misma. \"¡Maldita sea, Manech! Me prometiste que no llegaría este día.\" Golpea el colchón con el puño cerrado y lucha porque no se le escapen las lágrimas. \"Si cuento hasta siete y el cartero no ha hecho gritar al tío desde la cocina, no volveré a ver a Manech con vida.\" De nuevo, respira y, lentamente, cuenta. \"Uno… dos… tres… cuatro… cinco…\" Unos improperios escapan desde la planta baja tras esas palabras tan deseadas \"¡Carta para la señorita!\". Mathilde sonríe y se tranquiliza. Manech no siente la caída. Su guante rojo dibuja una mancha en el cielo al tiempo que de su rostro desaparece la sonrisa. Duele. Escuece. Pica. El Albatros me ha traicionado. Tras tantos años de vuelo, me abandona, vuela lejos, me olvida . Y, por segunda vez, regresa a ese día. Sus bocas se separan y suspiran. Él aún no ha abierto los ojos, no lo necesita. Ella reposa sobre su pecho, tranquila. Cualquiera diría que está dormida. Pero Manech sabe lo que le pasa. No necesita sumirse en la inconsciencia para que los sueños acudan a su mente. Mathilde les llama, les acaricia, les ofrece la fruta prohibida. Ellos se quedan, complacidos, y le regalan bonitas ideas. Manech juega con un mechón suelto; salvaje y domado, a un tiempo. Como su amor, como esas palabras que son grabadas a fuego en su mente: Manech aime Mathilde, Mathilde aime Manech . Y ese amor que prometía ser para siempre hermoso y eterno, desaparece como el hilo que les ataba aunque entre ellos hubiese tan largo trecho. Una última y débil sonrisa aparece en su rostro. Sus labios se deslizan, tiernos, antes de decir adiós a los recuerdos. \"Mathilde,\" susurran \"te quiero\". ","Summary":" Mathilde duerme.

I watched as everyone stared at me in surprise. I can't believe that had happened to me! How could I have been so stupid? I cried all night at the thought that my boyfriend (whom I'd been with for three years) broke up with me to date my best friend. Just then, the thought hit me. I've never felt any more stupid in my life. He wanted me at first, but when he had gotten to know Sophie, he dumped me for her. But why had it taken three years? I didn't know. I knew I looked like crap, but I didn't care. I walked past one of my best friend, glanced at him once, and he automatically knew what had happened. He left his group of friends to come and walk with me, \"Omigosh, Kairi, are you okay?\" I stared at him for a few moments and then replied, \"Do I look okay to you? My boyfriend just broke up with me for my best friend after three years of dating me! And guess what, now they're dating. What kind of friend is that?\" I started to cry as Brandon pulled me into his arms to hug me. I breathed in his familiar scent and automatically felt a little better. I stepped back and looked up at him. He changed so much over the summer, but I knew he was still the same Brandon I had become best friends with six years ago. Brandon knew me the best out of all my friends. Absentmindedly, I reached down into my locker to grab my normal books. Brandon still stood beside me when I looked up. I started walking and he followed beside me. We had almost all the same classes together, which meant that I would be okay for the part of the day I was with him. He shot glares at anyone who was staring or laughing at me. This morning I did everything like a robot. I never really knew what I was wearing till I glanced down. Predictably, I was wearing my normal attire. It included black basketball shorts and a blue tank top with a gray jacket over it. I didn't put any make up on today because I didn't care much for it. Brandon walked into the class first and I followed him. We sat in the very back beside each other. I scooted my chair closer to him. Right now Brandon was the only thing that made me feel better. I took his hand in mine and looked at our laced fingers. I never knew how much he meant to me until now. He was my best friend and I loved him. I never wanted to lose a friend like him. Thirty minutes into class and we were still holding hands, \"How are you doing?\" he whispered. I hesitated before answering, debating whether I should just tell him, \"Uh, I'm okay, I guess. It would be better if we could just leave school. I'm glad I have you to depend on. If I didn't, I probably would be in the bathroom crying this whole time.\" He let go of my hand and wrapped his arm around my shoulders, \"It's gonna be okay, Kairi. You still have me.\" I smiled slightly and replied, \"I feel like you're the only one I can trust. Sophie showed me that I can't trust her.\" We sat like that for the rest of the class. We didn't really pay attention during class but we didn't care. School was almost over anyway. I let Brandon go to his locker while I went the opposite way to mine. I walked slower than usual, hoping Brandon would come back and walk with me. I was passing the water fountain when I saw Sophie and Mike kissing. I was depressed for a moment but then anger overtook me. I walked up to them and started yelling, scaring them, \"What the heck is your freaking problem?\" I wanted to smack her so bad, but I held back. I felt arms go around my waist and knew it was Brandon. I didn't move away from him. Sophie took a step toward me with pleading eyes, \"Kairi…I…I'm sorry.\" She was saying something else but I cut her off, \"No, don't come near me. I don't care what you have to say. None of it matters anymore. It probably never did. You lied to me! All this time! Now I don't even know what is the truth,\" I stepped back, almost falling over Brandon. I was too mad to care that I had ripped my shirt on sharp object on the wall as I walked away. Brandon took his jacket off and handed it to me. \"Uh, Kairi? Um…your shirt is ripped pretty bad.\" I took the jacket from him and shrugged it on, \"I could care less right now. Ugh! Some people just made me mad.\" Brandon took my hand in his and smiled. \"What?\" I asked. He laughed softly and said, \"You're so funny when you're mad. Heh, you seem really ticked so maybe I should stop talking.\" I looked at him and started to smile, \"Thanks.\" I punched him lightly on the arm. We walked in our classroom and endured an hour and a half of boredom. Too bad we didn't have all our classes together.

There is a woman on board, her name is Katarzyna Fitzgerald (Kate), and she is the daughter of the captain of the ship named Pendleton. Hope you all enjoy the story please remember to R & R. Chapter 1: She was the first woman allowed to work on a ship, the first woman allowed on the ship. For years there had been this line that states no woman is fit to do a man's job. Well she was here to prove them wrong. To throw out that silly old line. Even though she was the daughter of the captain didn't mean that she was treated like a lady. She was treated like all the others, she was there to help the chief engineer. When she first came onto the boat Katarzyna saw the skeptical look Raymond Sybert (Ray) gave her. But soon she proved all the men wrong. Katarzyna Fitzgerald was no fragile woman, she was a force to recon with, the men soon accepted her as part of their own. Months had passed with no incident, only a crack in the haul that was fixed up. But Kate knew that there was something coming, she could feel it in her gut, and her feelings never let her down. She was looking at the crack when she felt someone put their hands on her shoulders, she tilted her head back and saw that it was Ray, she smiled at him. There had been a connection between them that she could not describe. She thought at the time that it was only her imagination but after a while she noticed that he as well felt it. She looked back at the crack, she wondered if the weld they done is gonna hold. In this weather it was almost impossible she could already hear it starting to hum. She sighed and looked at Ray again \"I don't know if this is gonna hold us in this storm\" she says. Ray only gave her a slight smile, she knew it was his way of trying to reassure her that everything is going to be fine. She heard one of the crew members coming to stand next to them. \"You should go and sleep a little Katarzyna \" he said to me, I looked at him and shook my head it was 4 am and I knew that even if I tried I would not be able to sleep. The boat suddenly rocked and she grabbed hold of the railing and shook her head. She then turned and went back to the control panel looking at it. She felt Ray moving to the opposite side, the humming of the crack got louder and Ray sighed as he picked up the phone and dialed the captain. He tried to reason with him to slow the boat down to 3 knots, but her father was stubborn he told Ray that the boat will hold. Kate sighed softly and looked at Ray \"I really hope he is right\" she said but she knew that he was not going to be right. She walked over to Ray and put her arms around him, she did not care what the other men will think if they see them. She just wanted to hold him, because she did not know if it would have been for the last time...[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Kate was standing behind Ray, when they suddenly heard a loud boom like sound. The next thing she noticed was that she was on the ground and Ray was on top of her, she closed her eyes as she felt a pain in her side, she frowned and then looked at Ray. He looked up at the crack and she looked to the side, the crack was open and it was spewing in water. Ray got up and then helped her up, \"Are you okay?\" he asked her and he looked her over and then he looked at her side, it was bleeding but only slightly. She pulled up her shirt and then looked at the cut, \"I am fine, it is not deep\" she says and she lets go of her shirt. She runs to the crack, she looks at it and shook her head. \"We need to slow this boat down\" she says and turns back to Ray, he was already on it, he had the phone in his hand and was about to call the captain. She still had a bad feeling, even though the worst has happen, she sighed and then walked back to Ray who put the phone down and looked at her. \"There is no answer, I am going to go sent someone to go and look\" he says, Kate shook her head at him and grabbed her jacket, \"I will go and take a look\" she says. Ray looked at her and she could see there was doubt in his eyes and he did not want her to go, she held up her hand, \"I will be fine, really besides it is my job to go out\" she replied. Ray walked to her and he hugged her, \"Be careful\" he says. Kate nodded and kissed him and then pulled away, she walked to the door and then looked back, \"I love you...\" she says and then she walks out. She walked up the stairs, she frowned slightly, she did not know what was going to be on the other side of that door. She put her hand on the door handle, she took a deep breath, \"Okay, everything is going to be okay\" she said softly to herself. She opened the door and then walked out, immediately the cold hit her, she zipped up her jacket and put on her hood. She lifted the lamp over her head and walked, she walked fast but with caution, just because she knows the ship like she knows her own body does not mean she must underestimate it, anything could happen. Only a slight slip might cost her, her life. The next step she took was a bad choice. There was nothing there she grabbed hold of the railing and then she saw it, the ship was torn in half. The other half was in front of her but sinking, the next moment the other half was gone. \"No!\" she screamed. She fell onto her knees, and put the lamp on the ground, she started crying. Ray was looking at the time, Kate was out too long. If she reached the captain's room she would have sent him a signal. He grabbed his coat he was on his way to the door when it opened and Kate walked in. He could see something was wrong, he grabbed the lamp out of her hand just in time and put it on the ground. He grabbed her when she wanted to fall. He picked her up in his arms and walked to one of the stairs where he put her down. He held her, \"What happened\" he asked her. She was shaking, Kate did not know what to say. She looked at him, \"The ship, it was torn in half the other half is gone and everyone on it\" she says softly. Ray sighed and pulled her close to him...[Chapter 3] p style=\"text-align: center;\"span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"strongChapter 3:/strong/span/p p style=\"text-align: left;\" /p p style=\"text-align: left;\"Ray had been holding Kate for a while, trying to let everything sink in. He could not believe that this was happening to them. He took a few more seconds to try and figure out what to do next. He looked at Kate then stood up giving out orders to the rest of the men. Everyone nodded and started working, putting on the pumps so that some of the water that was flowing in could be pumped out again. /p p style=\"text-align: left;\"Kate was in a daze and she watched Ray and the men working, then she stood up and walked upstairs to the kitchen to make sure everyone up there was okay and that no one was hurt. She told the kitchen crew what happened and like her they all where shocked. Ray and the rest of the crew that was under came into the kitchen, and Kate could see that he was deep in thought and she wondered what he was thinking. She smiled slightly at the head chef before she walked to Ray sitting down. She could hear that the men where arguing about what they should do. Some suggested they take the life boats and the others said that there should be another way, something else they could do. Then suddenly it grew quiet and everyone turned their attention to Ray and herself, they asked Ray what he thought was the best option, since Ray was the chief engineer and the highest ranking of them all. Ray looked at them for a moment, and then he turned to Kate, she could see that he was starting to form a plan, but that he needed her to back him up, he needed the courage. She smiled at him and took his hand in hers giving it a gentle squeeze, trying to encourage him. /p p style=\"text-align: left;\"Ray looked back at the rest of the men, \"We have the pumps, but it will only last us a few hours, once the water reaches the ventilation shafts of the pump it will stop running and we will sink\" he said. Kate frowned and listened and then she added knowing where Ray was going with this, \"We could run ashore\" , she looked at the men and they starting arguing with her and Ray saying it was crazy and they where going to die. Ray suddenly stood up, \"It is our only and best option a t the moment, if we do this right it could buy us and the search team some time, time that we need now\" he said. One of the men then asked how many time they have now before they sink and Ray answered with a few but enough to get us to a shoreline if we start working now. Kate stood up wanting to get this plan going as fast as she could, she did not have time to mourn the death of her father, she will do it later when she has time and if they get out alive. /p p style=\"text-align: left;\" /p p style=\"text-align: left;\"An hour or so later they where busy trying to get everything together, there had been some trouble earlier on with one of the crew members, he wanted to get on one of the life boats. Kate wanted to walk away to talk to the man when Ray picked up and axe, Kate frowned and followed him up not knowing what he was thinking or what he wanted to do. He suddenly swinged the axe, with the angle Kate was at she could not see what he hit and screamed no. She then ran forward and saw that he had cut the rope that held the life boat. The life boat tumbled to the bottom hitting the water, she looked down and saw a massive wave picking up the boat and slamming it into the tanker's side, making it break into pieces. She suddenly heard a commotion and she looked up, she saw that the man had Ray pinned against a pole and wanted to hit him. She ran forward and grabbed his arm \"Look, Ray just saved your life, the boat shattered to pieces against the tanker, this storm is too big, you would never survive it\" she said and then moved in between them. She looked at the man, she could see that he was struggling, if he wanted to punch Ray he would have to get through her and that will not be easy. He lifted his hand further back and she could feel Ray moving fast, he put his harms around her waist and turned them around, she could hear the man scream in fury and she closed her eyes waiting for the impact.../p ","Summary":" AN: Hey everyone so this is a new fanfic story, It is about the movie finest hours, but with a twis"},{"Movie":"Save the Last Dance","Title":"can you handle it?","Author":"PrettyBoysPrettyGirl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5029436","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Carnal Thoughts 'I shouldn't be thinking like this,' i thought to myself as I watched him slowly glide into the room. 'I shouldn't be having these feelings, especially when I'm dating his brother.' with that thought, as if right on cue, Edward walked in, trailing behind Alice, who, with her \"special power\", hadn't been talking to me that much lately. Jasper passed her and then they both disappeared out the door again. Come to think of it, she hasn't said more than two words to me since that day jasper tried to kill me. Again. The weird thing is, I liked it. I liked feeling helpless and scared out of my wits. I think Alice knew that. I also can't help but think that she knows that something is going to happen. At that, I smiled, despite my better judgment. Edward was already seated beside me, watching me intently as my mind wandered. Taking notice, I quickly altered my thoughts, straightened up, and prepared myself to look at his perfect face. I slowly turned toward him. And there it was. His smile. Barely a smile, just a smirk, my smirk. The smirk that drove me wild and sent me into oblivion whenever I thought about it. Whenever I thought about him. He truly was perfect, and soon, and very soon, I would tell him so, while lying on his beautifully sculpted chest, swooning in the aftereffect of our lovemaking. Very soon. I thought again to myself. He broke the intense silence with his angelic voice. \"Bella?\" his voice trailed my earlobe and slowly made its way to my brain. I almost fainted at the awesomeness of it. He smiled, reading the feelings that were etched across my face. He waited patiently as I came back to earth. He spoke with caution. \"Bella? Dear, what are you thinking about?\" \"Mmmnn, just thinking.\" I said, almost seductively. I heard him growl low in his throat and exhale deeply. I rolled my head backward, exposing my neck, then back again. Lower growling. This time with intensity. \"Bella, this isn't fair. Stop it, or imp going to have to-\" \"You're going to have to what?\" I said moving from my seat to the table top. We were at his house, with the family in the park, playing vamp baseball. \"Punish me?\" he was in front of me in an instant. \"maybe.\" he whispered deeply in my ear. I almost fainted, but held my composure. I heard him exhale deeply as he took in my scent. I was still in control. I exhaled, and said as calmly as I could, \"Edward?\" \"Hhmmn?\" he said as he nuzzled my neck. \"Tell me again why we haven't.....\" at that he stopped. \"...because I can't control myself,\" he said after a forever of silence. I slid off the table and proceeded to his room.\" who says I want you to?\" I lay motionless, as I was told, with his body crushing down on mine. I could tell he was holding back, which is not what I had asked for. I could feel his breath on my neck as he slowly planted a trail of kisses from my collarbone to my chest. I exhaled deeply and sighed. He pressed his lips to mine in an instant, but with caution. He smelled like peaches and heaven. I sighed at the touch of him, and that was all the invitation he needed to gently slide his tongue in mouth. He tasted like passion and love. I arched my back against him and felt him growl deep in his throat. I could tell he was holding on by a string. Suddenly the taste was gone and he was whispering sweet nothings in my ear. I was dazed and confused, but I'm pretty sure I heard him say \"your perfect.\" before I melted to him. Then it was I who was driving him over the edge, trailing kisses from his chest to his ear, mumbling something like \"your beautiful.\" before first licking his collarbone. I knew that was it. He growled, this time out loud, and flipped so that I was on top of him, reveling in his amazingness. He again claimed my mouth, working his way in angrily. The kiss was rough, almost violent, that my lips were sore from the impact. I winced at the pain, and he stopped abruptly, almost bringing tears to my eyes. \"I'm sorry. I knew that this was a bad idea.\" he had moved to stand near his shelf of books and classical cds. I knew he was upset with himself, and I wanted to comfort him. I also knew that he was turned on, and I wanted to appeal to that side as well. Provide equal attention, if you know what I mean. I moved off the bed and over to him. \"No, you didn't hurt me. I-\" \"Bella, don't patronize me. I know what I did. Look at your lips. There swollen because of my inability to control myself.\" \"But I don't want you to control yourself. I want you to control me.\" I was behind him now, running my hands over the muscles in his chest and stomach. He moaned in reply. \"Bella, it's not that simple. I could kill you.\" he gently pushed my hand away, but I could tell the feeling was gone. I was offended. \"Do you not want me?\" I said as I backed away from him. \" Am I not good enough?\" he was behind me in an instant. \"Is that what you think? Do you seriously think that its not taking every muscle in my body to refrain from ripping your clothes off and taking you right here?\" he kissed the nape of my neck. I was still thinking about those muscles he was using. Right now. At this very moment. God, I wanted him. \"Then why don't you? I love you, and I trust you, and you know as well as I do that you would never hurt me.\" \"I don't know that for sure, but I want to believe you. You're not the only one who wants this, but clearly I have to be the responsible adult.\" \"What? Are you saying I'm not responsible begun backing away again. I didn't think it was possible, but he pushed the wrong button. \"I meant exactly what I said, and I don't recall saying that you were irresponsible.\" \"But that's what you meant.\" he sighed. \"You know what I meant.\" I could hear the anger rising in his voice. I wasn't prepared to talk about this, mostly because I just wanted out of there, so I simply said, \"yeah, I think I do.\", and walked out. When I got home that night I was still fuming, so after saying good night to Charlie, I rushed to my room and slammed the window shut. I was not in the mood for Edward. Which is shocking? I never thought that those words would be present in my vocabulary, but sure enough, there they were. When I finally retired to bed, I found that my thinking was more than altered towards Edward. They were completely gone. He was a distant memory, only showing up when appropriate. What was even scarier was what was actually taking his place. His brother. Jasper I could not for the life of me get that boy out of my mind. He was dangerous and off limits. That just made me want him even more. I was mortified at that shocking realization. I wanted him. More and more each day. It was scary. I finally drifted off to sleep with jasper on my mind and guilt in my heart. The next morning I was still kind of disrot over all that went on last night. Mostly over my thoughts last night. They were guilt lined, and I felt really bad for it. Even as I was eating breakfast, I kept sneaking up on me. I was trying to get myself thinking about Edward again when there was a knock at the door. You can imagine my surprise when I opened it and there stood jasper. I froze where I stood. He walked in, without so much as a greeting, and sat down. I was still in shock but somehow managed to sit across from him at the kitchen table. Charlie's voice pulled me out of my mortification \"Bella, who's at the door?\" \"...uh... jasper. I guess he wanted to talk?\" he just nodded in my direction. Charlie was just glad to see that it wasn't Edward, so he went outside to work on my truck some more. He's been doing that a lot lately. I turned back to jasper. \"...so...what's on your mind?\" I asked quizzically. \"Listen. Ill cut right to the chase. Alice told me what has been occupying your thoughts lately.\" I instantly started to blush. I was embarrassed beyond belief. I could see him smirk out of the corner of my eye. It faded away quickly. I started defending myself immediately. \"Look, I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be thinking like that, especially when I'm dating your brother, but I'm just... I don't know. I-\" He cut me off with a kiss. It was so rough unanadvised that it threw me off balance. He noticed. After I regained my poseur, I just stood there, motionless, waiting for an explanation to his insanity. He said nothing, just waited impatiently while I caught my breath, before crushing his lips to mine once more. Jasper, with his \"special power\", had altered my mood completely. Instead of feeling embarrassed, I was inflamed with passion for this beautiful creature in front of me, urgent hands running all over my heated body, only to cool it with his touch. While lost in the passion of the kiss, I felt him push me backward until we hit the counter. I gasped in response and he complied with a growl. It sent chills down my back. He had forgotten that I needed to breathe, and I had to forcefully pull myself away from his anxious mouth. \" A little breather, please?\" I asked sympathetically. \"Sorry. It's been a while since I've been with someone who needed to breathe. Take your time.\" he said as he walked around the table, golden eyes shying in the sunlight. \"Thanks, but, I don't want to take my time, and nor should you.\" I said before flashing him a seductive glance and running up the stairs to my room, him bounding up after me. now lying on top of him, we once again connected our mouths feverently, his hands once again moving up and down on my body, only more urgently this time. He had followed instructions, unlike Edward. With that thought, I hesitated to let him ease me out of the red Tokyo hotel shirt I was currently wearing. He noticed my hesitation, and kissed me, softer, with feeling, not just lust. It helped to ease my guilt as he pushed it away and replaced it with longing. With that thought evaporated for m memory, I leaned back, away from his face and onto his thighs. He moaned deeply in his throat as I pulled my shirt over my head and threw it to the floor. He starred in awe, before pressing his cheek to my breast. It was cool, a new sensation that I had never experienced before. I loved it. He moved to the other, before first kissing it lightly. I was lost in the sheer ecstasy of the moment, and I didn't notice until he grunted with frustration that he was struggling with the button on my jeans. Finally he gave up and ripped them in two and flung them across the room. I gasped and he lightly whispered in my ear \"ill buy you a new pair.\" I smiled in admiration for his concern, but hid the fact that those were my favorite pair of jeans. He moved again and was planting a trail of kisses down my neck and chest, then abruptly stopping at my panty line. He brought his gaze up slowly, taking in the sights, even though I could tell he was completely serious. \"Are you sure you're ready for this?\" I took this thought into consideration, smiling to myself while seeing that faint twinkle of concern in his beautiful eyes. I responded by kissing him passionately, then allowed him to flip me over while he claimed my mouth once more. Once on my back, I gently pulled away, then hooked my fingers inside the lining of my panties and slid to down, letting him see the intensity of the action. I think I moved a little too slow, because he got impatient and \" helped me\" the rest of the way. When they were on the floor beside the bed, and he had removed the remainder of his clothing, we just sat there, intrigued by each others bodies. Our fingers explored off limits areas, though that was no longer accurate. When we had gotten our fill (literally), he laid me down ever so gently and kept me distracted with his rough and heated kisses that it surprised me when I felt his member slide in me. I let myself be consumed in the sheer ecstasy of his basic movements, stroking my hair, whispering in my ear, kissing away my tears of pure joy. It was amazing. I cooned lightly and all the control I could feel that he was using came to an abrupt stop. He moved his hands from my head and side and slid them underneath me. He began moving furiously, with out a speck of control as I screamed out in pain and pleasure. He realized his mistake at once and stopped moving all together, causing tears of abandonment to stream down my face. \" No! What am I doing?\" I heard him say. He was beating himself up inside and I could see the remorse on his face. \" What are you talking about? You were doing great. It was everything I expected, everything I craved, and more.\" I said as I wiped away my tears. \"Then why are you crying?\" he asked, a confused look on his face. \"Because…you stopped. You stopped and left me.\" \"What? Bella, I'm still inside you.\" \" I know, but… I don't know, it just hurt that you were thinking about leaving.\" \"Well don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.\" And with that he pushed violently back inside me, causing me to scream unexpectantly. He took that as a greeting to claim my mouth even as he rose high and went deep. End so was it terrible? go ahead and comment. i doubt you will be able to hurt my feelings. no offense to those who take joy in doing just that. i'm like that , comment. i promise i wont get mad and hunt you down. mostly i mean that. it was my first fanfic.

Save The Last Dance belongs to MTV and Paramount movies. Alright, let's get the obvious out of the way. I hate the squeal, it ruins the first movie. Save the last dance 2 doesn't exist in my mind. It was the beginning of a nice Saturday morning and Sara Johnson, soon-to-be Sara Reynolds had a mix of feelings in her stomach. If she was nervous on the day that she started her new school, if she on the day of her audition to Juilliard, if she was nervous on the day of her graduation, if she was nervous on the day that she moved into her own home, if she was nervous when she got her first gig as a principal ballerina, if she was nervous when she danced in front of her first large crowd...then it was all nothing compared to how she was feeling now. Sara felt nervous and sweaty all of over. Not knowing what else to do, she decided to dance a mix of ballet and hip-hop. To think it's been 16 years, since she met Derek and had become a couple. Now, they were planning to spend the rest of their lives together. As Sara turned on the music and began to dance, random thoughts began go through her head, so many people were coming to her and Derek's wedding, their friends from high school, from both Juilliard and Georgetown, their friends from work and most importantly their families. However, there was one woman that Sara wished could be there on her wedding day, her mom. Sara, signed even though it had been 16 years, she still missed her mom. Then suddenly, she heard a loud knock at the door and a familiar voice yelling \"Open up, it's your bridesmaids!\" Pulling herself back into reality, Sara turned off the music, stopped dancing and walked over to her front door. As she opened it, she was greeted by Chenille Reynolds, Diggy, Joy and Zoey from Lemont, Solidad, her friend from Juilliard and Sam her friend from work. Sara let a scream of delight as she and her bridesmaids pulled each other into a tight hug. \"Today's the day, you join my family. Are you excited?\" Chenille said, clearly happy about the idea. \"Yes.\" Sara replied, as all her fears and anxieties washed away from her. \"Then what are you waiting for? Let's get ready.\" Chenille cried, as the rest of the bridesmaids cheered. At once, Sara got out her wedding dress, while Chenille and the rest of the bridesmaids got changed into their outfits. Once they were finished, they helped Sara into her wedding dress. After Sara was ready, they were ready to go and all they had to do was wait for the limo. \"I can't believe you got a limo.\" Chenille stated in amazement. \"I know, right.\" Diggy agreed. \"Anyway, who's watching your son?\" Zoey asked. \"My parents are. They agreed to watch him for today.\" Chenille mentioned. \"Didn't I already tell you this yesterday at the bachelorette party?\" She added. \"Oops.\" Zoey said as she blushed with embarrassment. Sara, Chenille and the rest of the bridesmaids couldn't help but laugh. Then, Sara heard a buzzing. At once she checked her phone and saw that the limo had arrived. \"Guys, the limo's here!\" Sara cried. The group of girls all cheered as they made their way outside. They cheered even louder as they saw the limo and got inside. However just before she got inside, Sara took one last look at her home, or more accurately her former home. After today, it would no longer be her home and she would move in with Derek to a starter home after the honeymoon. Once, she got inside with the rest of the bridesmaids, she took another look as Chenille said \"Alright, everybody say 'Bye House!'\" \"Bye house!\" cried the group of bridesmaids as the limo drove down to the church. \"Let's turn up the music!\" Diggy offered and the rest of the girls cheered in response. The limo driver obliged and so the bride and her bridesmaids were singing and dancing to the songs on the radio. Sometime later, Sara and the rest of the bridesmaids arrived at the church. Sara, Chenille and the rest of the bridesmaids exited the limo, thanked the driver and entered the church. At the sight of the church, Sara took a deep breath. This is it. She thought to herself, once she entered that church, she would no longer be Sara Johnson, she would be Mrs. Derek Reynolds. Taking another deep breath, Sara followed her friends into the church where she was greeted by her father Roy, all dressed up in a tux. Then it was time for wedding, the flower girl, the ring bearer and the bridesmaids all went down the aisle, it was Sara's turn. Taking her father's arm in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other, the two of them walked down the aisle. Then she saw him, Derek. Her fiance, her soon-to-be husband and the love of her life. He looks so handsome in that tuxedo. Sara thought to herself, just as she and her father reached Derek. Then as Sara stood beside Derek, her father walked off to the side and Sara handed her bouquet to one of her bridesmaids, just as the reverend began the ceremony. \"Dearly beloved.\" The Reverend began \"We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.\" The the Reverend paused for a moment and asked \"Who giveth this woman to this man?\" \"I do.\" Roy spoke as he placed Sara's hand into Derek's. Then Sara and Derek looked at each other with love as the Reverend said \"I Derek…\" \"I Derek.\" Derek repeated. \"Take thee, Sara Juliet Isabella...\" The Reverend added. \"Take thee, Sara Juliet Isabella…\" Derek once again repeated. \"To my wedded wife…\" the Reverend stated. \"To my wedded wife.\" Derek repeated. Meanwhile in the audience, the flower girl had to go to the bathroom and went over to one of the bridesmaids and asked if one of them could take her. As Derek continued to say his vows, the bridesmaids quietly argued amongst themselves. Finally, it was decided that Zoey would take her to the bathroom. Since the flower girl really had to go and the other bridesmaids all but forced her to. Zoey and the flower girl left as it was Sara's turn to say her wedding vows. \"I, Sara Juliet Isabella…\" the Revered started \"I, Sara Juliet Isabella.\" Sara said. \"Take thee, Derek.\" The Revered added. \"Take thee, Derek.\" Sara stated \"To my wedded husband...\" the Reverend continued. \"To my wedded husband.\" Sara said in reiteration. \"To have and to hold…\" the Reverend added. \"To have and to hold.\" Sara added in repetition. \"From this day forward…\" the Reverend coached along \"From this day forward.\" Sara said as she repeated the words as she did many in rehearsal. \"For better or worse...\" the Reverend stated. \"For better or worse.\" Sara repeated \"For richer or poorer…\" the Reverend added. \"For richer or poor.\" Sara said in reiteration. \"In sickness and in health…\" the Reverend continued. \"In sickness and in health.\" Sara said in repetition. \"To love and cherish…\" the Reverend stated. \"To love and cherish.\" Sara recited. \"Til death do us part...\" the Reverend once again coached as he completed the vows. \"Til death do us part.\" Sara finished with a smile. Derek and Sara continued to gaze at each other with love in their eyes as the Reverend said \"By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.\" Derek and Sara kissed each to applause and their guests not only applauded their kiss one time, they applauded again after the party had finished sometime later. Just before, Sara and Derek entered the cab, Sara got ready to toss the bouquet to her bridesmaids when she tossed it, Chenille caught it. Then Sara and Derek got in the cab and drove off to their honeymoon. What do you think? Please leave a review. ","Summary":" I don't own any characters.

This is another attempt at a fanficlet… I usually writernoriginal stuff, but I'll try anything once (except for a few things… Jrn). P.S. it's a letter from Sara to Derek for the first bit… Shoebox Dear Derek It's Valentine's Dayrnhere at Juilliard and I miss you more than you can imagine. I know that sounds cheesy,rnbut I'm not quite as hip-hopping, non-fluff advocate as you are. I just wantedrnto let you know that I love you, especially today. There's a new student here thisrnterm, her name is Anna-Mae and she is a street girl turned ballerina. Imaginernthat. She's my new roommate, since my last one got expelled for smoking pot. Atrnleast the level of fumes has gone down. JrnShe's from the Bronx , and she came here for ballet. Will wondersrnnever cease? I really miss my mom today. It's been so long since I really talked tornher, and I remember that I really wanted to tell her that I loved her beforernshe died, but it came too soon. Man, she was so busy that day in the flowerrnshop, Valentine's, you know… Well, sweetie, this is just a short one to greet you for Valentines,rnand I should be closing this up. Love, Sara Derek folded up the letter and put in an old Adidas shoeboxrnand placed it on the top shelf of his closet. He walked over to the fridge andrnpulled out a Coke. He missed Sara so much, it wasrneating away at him. Sure, people thought that black and white couldn't berntogether, because it was wrong, but he knew otherwise. He also didn't give arnrip about what anyone else thought, because Sara was special. More special thanrnany of the other girls he had dated. He decided that it was time to pay a visitrnto Sara. And soon, because he was going nuts. Dear Derek Spring is sornbeautiful! The daffy-do-dills are up and singing to us all every morning. Yourrnsurprise visit was so sweet! Thanks so much for brightening my day. You arernloveable, you know that? I am never going to forget being kicked out ofrnMcDonalds because you started spouting out what a good ballerina I am…whatever,rnI am not good enough yet for that. You know how much I hate flattery, but yournare good. Very good, Mr.! I am sorry that all my letters havernjust been short little ditties, but I am really low on free time, with all thernwork I have to do. I miss the easy classes I used to take! All my love, Sara Derek placed the letter back in its envelope and once againrnput it in the Adidas shoebox. He didn't have the heart to write back to tellrnher that he couldn't visit her again for a while, so he decided to just forgetrnabout it. Forget about Sara for a while, until he could scrounge up enoughrnmoney to get to her. He shoved the shoebox into the farthest corner of hisrncloset and covered it with an old Yankees sweatshirt. The less he thought aboutrnher, the less it ate away at him. He still loved her, of course, but for therntime being it was simply too difficult to read her letters and smile, becausernhe never really had a girlfriend who was his best friend, too. It was too muchrnto deal with, Sara being away. Soon her letters got less andrnless frequent. They became shorter and shorter, and in the corner of his closetrnstill sat the shoebox, under the sweatshirt. Derek re-read her longer lettersrnand analyzed them as far as they would go, in hopes of finding another messagernhidden that he hadn't seen before. Finally, in early June, another letter camernfrom Juilliard: Dear Derek I don't know how torntell you this, because I feel like I don't know you, even though Sara talkedrnabout you every day, so I guess I do know you in a way. Two weeks ago, as Sararnand I were headed for the subway to go shopping, a man walked quickly towardsrnus and asked us the time. As Sara rolled up her sleeve to look at her watch hernpressed a gun into her side. He told me not to scream or say anything or hernwould shoot her. So I stayed silent. I promise I didn't say anything. The manrnasked Sara if she had any drugs or money or jewellery. She said that the onlyrnthing she had on her was her credit card and the friendship ring that you gavernher, Derek. The man took her credit card and he told her to take the ring off. \"Irncan't,\" Sara said, \"My best friend gave it to me. \" He pressed the tip of the gun furtherrnbetween her ribs and she winced. \"Give it to me now.\" He demanded, whisperingrninto her ear. She took off the ring and flung it across the floor of the subwayrnstation, \"Grab, it!\" she told me, and so I ran to get the ring. \"You took onernstep too far missy, and now part of you is going to stain the floor.\" And hernshot her in the head and ran. It was like everything was silent and in slowrnmotion. I screamed and people came running, chasing the man and calling 911.rnBut Sara was already dead. I don't know how you will take this, but don't blamernyourself, or the ring you gave her, she loved you and she was willing to diernfor loving you. The funeral is on Sunday afternoon on the 15th ofrnJune. It's at the old cemetery downtown. She would want you to be there, Derek,rnand I want to meet the man who loved her. Regretfully, Anna-Mae Derek tilted the envelope into his hand and the friendshiprnring tumbled out onto his palm. For the first time in a while he let a tearrnslip down his face. Then another and another, and soon many tears joined thernfirst one. He slipped the ring onto a chain and put it around his neck. He readrnthe inscription that he remembered so well telling the jeweller to engrave. \"To my best friend, Sara\" THE END ","Summary":" A.N.

How unusual!nIt wasn't even eleven o 'clock AM yet! Sighing, I pulled on my black skirtnand boots, a strappy glitter top… I was making my way through the white, quilted streets in my long,nfur coat when my name was called. Startled, I jumped and turned to wherenthe sound had come from. There, stood the unmistakable shape of Nikki. Hernblack hair and in my opinion monkey like face faced me, her muddy brownneyes staring daggers. \"You better keep away from Derek at Steppes.\" \"Screw you.\" I replied, attempting to stride away. She grabbed my shouldernand whispered in my ear, \"Watch it, white girl, coz I ain't puttin' up with you, gettin' in my waynas I said before to you.

She had hurt me, I had let her get to me. She was lying,nwasn't she? I entered the music-filled building, disco lights flashing acrossnthe ceiling, walls and floor. Hundreds of people were on the dancefloornwith either partners or themselves, dancing to the beat. There, in thencorner of the room was Chenille, waving at me. I ran towards her, but wasnpulled back and to the floor by a cold hand. I yelled as I hit the floor.nIt was Nikki and her friend Alyssa. \"Look, bugger off!\" I shouted at her, but she laughed at me and beckonednto Derek. He followed her, smiling down at me. I stared disbelievingly asnhe danced with her. I stormed angrily out of Steppes, Chenille and Dereknfollowing me closely. \"Sara! SARA!\" I ignored him, but Chenille finally managed to stop me in myntracks. I watched Nikki walk past us, satisfaction written all over hernface. She waved cheekily at me and I stuck my middle finger up at her. Thensmile disappeared from her face and she stalked away in a huff. \"Sara, look, we were just dancing, like I did before when you had yournsecond time at Steppes, remember?\" \"What was that kiss all about then.\" I said stubbornly, folding my armsnand turning my back on him. \"I think I better leave you two alone.\" Chenille stared at Derek sternly,nangrily, before walking away. \"Sara, I …\" \"I what? What was it all about Derek?! HUH?! Am I not good enough fornyou?! Or is it white people?!\" I turned to him, tears leaking down my face.nI was so angry. I shouted and shouted at him. \"Look –\" \"I DON'T NEED TO LOOK, MR REYNOLDS! I'VE SEEN IT ALL!! Oh yeah, and rulenno.1, shut up when I'm talking.\" I said nastily, stomping away and leavingnhim bewildered and hurt behind me, but I didn't care. He'd probably go offnwith Nikki now and forget all about me. He's probably even forgotten thatnI'm moving away in less than a month's time! I returned home, slumping myself onto the couch. The morning I hadnspent at Steppes had only lasted half an hour, and I was tired, angry andnupset at the same time. I wish I had never gone. When I least expected it,na knock came at my door. I sighed, pulling it open. There, stood Nikki,nAlyssa and their new friend, a girl named Renée. I attempted to slam thendoor on their sourpuss faces, but Nikki thrust her hand onto the dirty woodnwith a 'smack'. She was smiling evilly, and her two friends smirking likenthey had just seen the funniest thing in the world. \"What the hell do you want? And how did you get my address?\" \"Oh, a certain guy called Derek gave it to us just a second ago.\" \"Look, aren't you happy enough with what you've got? Derek and me arenover, so go and visit your new boyfriend.\" \"Revenge is so sweet though Sara, so sweet.\" Nikki clicked her fingers andnAlyssa plus Renée leapt onto me. \"Get off of me! Get off!\" I screamed at them. Nikki closed the door andngrabbed one of my favourite cushions. It was the biggest in the house, andnthe heaviest. She covered my face with it, Renée, Alyssa and herselfnsitting on top of me. Muffled screams escaped my mouth, but not thencushion. I screamed and screamed, air was running out. Two minutesnpassed…three minutes, four and then five. They lifted the cushion off mynface and I could breathe again. I took large gulps of air, panting heavily.nThen, I could hear bath water running. Alyssa and Renée had my arms behindnmy back in some kind of lock, as they dragged me into the bathroom. Instruggled and tried to kick them, but they slapped me until my face was rednand sore. Nikki switched off the taps, and there, in front of me, wasndirty, deep and muddy water. Nikki thrust my head under the water and Infelt two heavy heads on my own head. I supposed they had taken off theirntrousers, underpants and socks, as they couldn't stand getting wet, letnalone dirty. Five more minutes passed, but this time they carried onnsitting on me, and I knew it. They were determined to kill me this time. Incould hear their laughter drowning me instead of the water. All of ansudden, the bathroom door broke down and I heard a voice shout, \"SARA! GET AWAY FROM THERE!\" They heavy weight that was upon me dispersed,nand I could hear feet quickly shuffling out of the room, out of the flatnroom. I had no energy to pick myself up and when I had been brought out ofnthe water, I saw who it was. DEREK. Suddenly, I had fainted clean out. I woke up in my bed, a dark figure hanging over me. I blinked asneverything came into focus. Derek was sitting at my bedside, sayingnsomething I couldn't hear yet. I blinked again and struggled to sit up. Henpulled me up, and I rested against the wall. \"Are you ok? I saw what Nikki did and I'm sorry I couldn't be there fornyou earlier.\" I smiled, throwing my arms around his neck. \"I'm just so glad you saved me! Nikki that bitch…I knew she would try tonkill me one of these days!\" His face was full of mingled fury. \"I'll get her, I will!\" Derek yelled loudly, clenching his fists. Therenwas a long, uncomfortable silence to follow after his statement, but soonnenough, he had broken it once again. \"Hey, um, I know your dad won't be back until gone three thirty so why notnstay at mine? You can share a room with Chenille 'n me. Leave your dad annote.\" I smiled and nodded my head in agreement. Clambering out of bed, Inbegan to pack my bag. We once again stepped out into the cold, chilly streets ofnChicago South, covered in a white snow quilt, stretching for as far as theneye could see. Dark, grey clouds rolled in, blocking out the sun,nresembling a golden ball. The grass and black iron gate was frosted withnice, sharp, dagger-like icicles hanging from the house porches like sharks'nteeth. When we had reached Derek's house, Chenille was standing at the door,ntapping her foot impatiently. She looked slightly irritated. \"Where the he-ell have you been Derek? Me 'n Moma Dean o' been worriednsick about you!\" \"I was going to apologize to Sara, but I saw Nikki tryin' to drown 'er, sonI rescued 'er and waited till she woke up. She's stayin' round oursntonight, left her daddy a note to say so coz he wouldn't be home till threenthirty AM.\" Chenille's icy expression that was matching the weather changednto a sunny smile. \"Well girl, c'mon in and make yerself at 'ome! Ai?\" \"Ai!\" I replied gleefully, glad someone appreciated my company. Upon entering Derek's house, I noticed it was much bigger than mynown, dirty little flat. \"Wow.\" I breathed, raising my eyebrows and letting them fall quickly. \"Nuthin' special!\" Chenille and Derek chorused, smiling a smile that barednhis pearl white teeth. I smiled uncertainly back at him, but luckily hendidn't notice my half-heartedness. He dragged me down the landing, into anbig room, containing a triple Decker bunk bed. \"OH, SLAMMIN'!\" I cried happily. They laughed at me, but I ignored this,nbeaming from ear to ear.

Derek was the first person who she had loved and even though they decided to date other people, he still had her heart. \"Sara!\" Chenille shouted down the phone pulling Sara back to the conversation \"That's fine.\" Sara said trying to hid her feelings \"Right,\" Chenille said \"We arrive at 1.50 tomorrow, Grand Central station. We're going to check into the hotel first and then we should meet up.\" \"Sure,\" Sara said \"Do you want me to come to you.\" \"Girl, we want to come to Julliard.\" \"O.K.\" Sara said peeling her orange \"Talk to you tomorrow, girl.\" \"Bye.\" Sara said hanging up. She sighed to herself, she missed her friends but she didn't know how Derek would react to her new boyfriend Miles. \"Hey Sara.\" Her roommate Zoe said sitting down next to her \"Hey.\" Sara replied lost in thought \"You o.k.? You look like you've seen a ghost\" \"My friends are coming to visit tomorrow for the next two weeks.\" Sara replied \"So?\" Zoe asked \"I thought you liked your friends?\" \"I do like my friends. It's just one of my friends, is my ex.\" \"So what?\" Zoe asked \"Miles doesn't know about my friend and my friends don't know about Miles.\" \"Oh my,\" Zoe said the realization of what Sara was trying to say coming clearer. \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \"I don't know,\" admitted Sara. AN: I hope you all liked and here is a preview of chapter 2. \"She's late,\" Replied Derek. \"Give the girl a break; she's training to be a prima ballerina,\" Chenille snapped. \"Yeah man, it's not exactly like you run on time, since you came back.\" \"Shut up Snookie.\" Everyone groaned. AN: I hope you all liked, please review![Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Save the Last Dance doesn't belong to me, so please don't sue. AN: Thank s to everyone who reviewed the last chapter.

Five minutes later, Sara rushed into the reception hall. \"Sara!\" Chenille shouted. Sara rushed over to Chenille and hugged her. \"Hey Chenille,\" Sara said. \"Look at you girl, you look slamming,\" Chenille said smiling. \"You look fantastic,\" Sara said. \"Hi Sara,\" Diggy said. \"Hey Diggy,\" Sara said hi-fiving her. \"Hello Sara,\" Kenny said. \"Hey Kenny,\" Sara said. \"Damn girl, look at you!\" Snookie said. \"You're hot.\" \"Thank you Snookie,\" Sara replied. \"Sara,\" Derek said eyeing Sara up and down. \"Derek,\" Sara replied coldly. \"So tour guide, on with the tour,\" Snookie said. AN: I know this chapter was short, but I promise to make longer chapters. Here is the preview of chapter three. \"Trombonist,\" Miles said coming over to us. \"Hey Miles,\" I said silently praying he would go away. \"Who is this Sara?\" Diggy asked. \"Miles Santana,\" Miles said. \"Sara's boyfriend.\" AN: So, how will everyone react to this piece of information?

Derek smiled atnher. All of a sudden a sense of guilt cast a shadow upon thenwonderful night. The love in his eyes was tearing her heart apart. Hendeserved someone else, someone better, someone who would never donwhat she did. Her feelings of remorse came too late. It happened andnthere was nothing she could do about it. No turning back time, thenclock kept ticking and time was running out. They had only 3 weeksnleft together, the thought of being away from him was terrifying. But he wasnbetter off without her, he was worth to be loved by an angel. Andnthere was one thing Sarah knew for sure: she wasn't going to heaven!nFor 1 moment, the devil took over and made her caress her worstnenemy. Crossed the line between hate and love, between innocence andnguilt. Shocked by what she saw in the mirror, the old Sarah wasngone...She was taken away from holyness under Satan's curse. No! Whatnwas she thinking? The old Sarah wasn't gone at all! She was stillnthere and so were her feelings for Derek. She made a mistake, a bignone, but it didn't change her as a person. Doubts were filling hernmind but she knew things would be over if she told him. Damnit, shenhad to stop being so selfish. Derek had the right to know, even if itnwould ruin their relationship. Why didnshe always mess up a good thing? Every single person that ever lovednher, was doomed. Her mum died because she was rushing to come to hernaudition for Julliard and now she was about to lose Derek. Everythingnwas her own fault, she wasn't meant to be happy. Nobody'snperfect but he was the only boy she ever knew who was so close tonperfection. He fought for their relationship, he always showednrespect and loved her with all his heart and soul. Why didnshe do this? Malakai was Derek's opposite, he hated her and shenhated him. He had no respect for women, and certainly not for thenwhite trailer trash like Sarah. He was walking a different path,ngoing in the wrong direction. And yet, that one night, it looked asnif he'd changed. Sarah was so stupid to believe he really cared fornher and Derek, he said he wanted to get them back together. He tooknadvantage of the situation, Sarah felt vulnerable and was unable tonthink clear. Malakai was the devil in person, only cared aboutnhimself. He was so slick, she was too blind to see that vicious looknin his eyes. Their bodies became one but it didn't feel right atnall. With Derek and her, it was heaven on earth, more than lust, thatnwas love! But with Malakai, there was no love involved, only sexualnpleasure. The songnended and Derek gave her a sweet little peck on the cheek. Sarah tookndeep breath and said: \"Let's go back home baby, we have tontalk...\".[Chapter 2] Chapter Two One singlentear escaped from her mysterious eyes when he gently stroked herncheek. Derek tried to make her sadness disappear with a soft touch ofnhis lips but she pushed him away. \"Whatnthe hell is wrong with you Sarah? Just tell me!\" She wasnnervous, too afraid to look at him questioning what was going on.nAnother tear escaped and many more followed. Derek held her in hisnstrong, protecting arms and she never felt this guilty. He was anwonderful person and yet, she betrayed him. Together, they survivednevery obstacle, gave all haters the undeniable proof that milk doesnmix with brown sugar. Together... But she had to accept the fact thatnthey won't be for much longer. It was time... \"Derek,nthis will probably be the hardest thing I'll ever have to do butnyou need to hear this. While we were apart, I did something I trulynregret. I was vulnerable and although I know it doesn't justifynwhat I did, I need you to know how I felt at that time. I trustednMalakai, he listened to my problems and gave me a shoulder to cry on.nI really thought he meant well but I took it too far...I slept withnhim...\" She lookedninto Derek's eyes and knew it was over. He didn't say a word whennhe turned around and walked out the door. Sarah was certain he wouldnnever come back to her ever again. She pickednup the phone and dialed a number. \"Whassup,nthis Chenille...Who's calling?.....Hello?.....\" \"...Chenille...\" \"Sarah?nIs that you? Are you ok ? What's wrong girl?\" \"Can youncome to my place? Hurry!\" Knocknknock...Sarah opened the door and saw her friend standing therentotally confused. \"Sarah,nhave you been crying?

I know the story isn't here now it's because Inthought that it was too retarded and I made Hermione sound like a slut. Indeleted to from my computer and the website and wrote another story NOTnrelated to Harry Potter in any way. Hope you like this one! (I'm doing mynbest to write stories that'll interest you but I'll leave you guys tondecide whether it's good or average or just passed. If you know what Inmean) As dawn broke, Samantha Brook, a thirteen-year-old teen, awoke drowsily tonfind her in a two-room apartment. She moved from New York to San Francisconto live with her father. Her mum had met with a car crash while rushing tonher dance audition at her school two weeks ago. She sat down cross-legged on the soft, squishy bed and thought to herselfnin rage: 'She's gone for good Samantha, GONE you get it? GONE FOREVER! Andnyou are alone to blame! Why couldn't you have just gotten on with thenstinking audition without her watching?' Samantha scolded herself, 'and nownshe's gone! But I remembered her death like it was yesterday..' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Flashback*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"Mum you promised!\" shouted Samantha at her mother Ginger, \"you promisednthat you would be at my audition this afternoon!\" Her mum pulled herselfnaway from the design she was working on. \"Samantha, you know how busy I am these days. Why can't you understand thatnI have a deadline to submit this design to the director which is tomorrownmorning at eight and I'm not even half done yet!\" her mum said sternly.nDespite the fact she was scolding Samantha, she still had that look of carenand concern. \"Sorry mum, but I just need you to be there to give me the confidence thatnI need to get through this, I really do,\" apologized Samantha, \" well Inguess it's okay if you really cannot make it to my audition. I wouldn'tnmind much anyway\". \"Samantha honey, you don't need me there for confidence, you dance like annangel and I'm sure you'll make it. But I suppose if you really need me.\"nsaid her mum in a matter-of-fact tone. She took a platinum ring off hernfinger and strung it on a silver chain. Samantha watched as her mothernclasped the necklace around Samantha's neck. Samantha smiled as she saw thenreflection of her mother's loving eyes in the sparkling deep red ruby thatnwas embedded in the centre of the ring. \"I'm always there for you, but Inwill try my very best to come okay?\" asked her mum in a soft, comfortingnvoice. \"Thanks mum, I love you very much,\" said Samantha. And her mum gave her thenwarmest hug anyone could give, \"I love you very much too Samantha\" repliednher mum in return. Samantha was warming up before the audition started, 'I hope that mumncomes, it would really mean the world to me' she hoped. \"No Stanley! I can't go to the office in the afternoon I've got to watch myndaughter's dance audition!\" screamed Ginger over her cell phone to her bossnas she walked to her Mercedes Benz. \"Ginger I really need you in the office this afternoon. We have people fromnoverseas coming in to look at the designs we have so far this week and wencan't afford to lose the deal!\" explained Stanley in one whole breath.n\"Besides, you could watch your daughter dance any old time you want!\". This really upset Ginger and she hung up on him as she unlocked her car. 'Inhope I'm not too late for my little girl's audition. She's going to be sondisappointed if I don't show up on time. Oh God please see her through thisnfor me' prayed Ginger. She started her engine and sped off to herndaughter's audition. While in school, almost all of Samantha's friends were done with thenaudition and a whole lot of people were also done. Samantha was with a fewnothers who weren't done yet either. 'Where could mum be?' she thought, 'She was supposed to be here ten minutesnago'. \"Stupid bastard, why can't you just move?!\" screamed Ginger from her carnwindow. The traffic was terrible, some huge truck stopped in the middle ofnthe road for God knows what pathetic reason. \"Shut up bitch! I'm trying to move!\" the driver shouted back. \"Why don'tnyou try driving a 500 ton vehicle across town without breaking down atnleast once huh?!\" While in school, Samantha decided to wait no longer and went into thenaudition room. The examiners asked her questions like 'why do you want tondo this' and ' since when did you start to take an interest in thisnsideline'. She answered them pretty well for a thirteen-year-old. \"Take your place and you may start when you are ready,\" said one of thenexaminers. Samantha started at her position. She danced like she's never dancednbefore. However, due to the incorrect use of some body parts, she fell onentoo many times. \"Oh God damn it! I'm late for Samantha's audition!\" Ginger muttered. \"Ohnthank goodness the traffic's finally moving!\" she said vulgarly. When suddenly. CRASH! The truck hit Ginger's car and she was thrown out of it. She tumbled andnhit her head on the sidewalk, and then came to a stop. Her pulse stopped,nhead wounded, thick brown hair all over her bloody face. She was dead. The police arrived at Samantha's school and told her the devastating news.nHer stomach twisted, lurched, she couldn't take it anymore. She broke downncrying in the cold dark hallway of the audition room. She cried her eyes out in her room that night. \"Mum, I would cry you anriver every night if I have to. I love you and it's all my fault thatnyou're gone\". ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*End of Flashback*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 'But now Samantha,' she thought to herself once more, 'it's time to startnanew from this day forth. No turning back. Nothing else you can do but looknahead.' She jumped out of bed ready to face the day ahead. A/N: How did you find it? Let me read your reviews. Thanks loads![Chapter 2] A/n: Hey!

P.S: Oh, and I forgot to mention, Samantha didn't make it throughnthe audition. The examiners dismissed her after she fell the third time.nSorry it took so long! (^_^*) Chapter Two - New School, New Environment, New Everything Samantha's father pulled up in front of her new school, Angel Junior High.nAs they sat in the car, her father asked her warmly, \"Samantha, are younready to for your new school?\" \"Not really Dad, but I have to go through this right?\" Samantha asked, \"AndnI will make new friends, have new teacher and I'll have to get used to thennew environment right?\" \"Yes, Samantha, yes. You will make new friends and you will get used to thenway they do things around here.

It's all my fault that she's gone Dad\" Samanthansobbed in agony. \"It was all my fault,\" she whispered. \"Samantha honey, don't ever think like that.\" \"Nobody is to be blamed fornanything that happens in life\" comforted her father, \"Some people arendestined to die at a young age, and some are destined to live longer. Andnno one can change that fact. Come on, stop crying, you're all sploggy now\".nSamantha chuckled a little at this. \"There, that's better. Oh yea before Inforget, here's your allowance for this week\" said her father as he handednher a crispy twenty dollar note. \"And here's a your cell phone,\" he continued. \"You got me a cell phone?!\" shouted Samantha in disbelieves. \"Well yea, but it's pre-paid okay? And switch it off while you're in class\"nHe warned. \"Yea well I don't care! Dad you're the best!\" Shrieked Samantha happily.n\"Bye Dad! I love you! And thanks for the cell!\" thanked Samantha. She gavenher father a peck on the cheek and hopped out of the car overjoyed. After she'd seen her father turn into the next street, she turned to facenthe new school.

I turnednaround and saw both Kirsten and Gordon behind me. Usually, we all met afternschool to do our homework together, but today I was in a hurry. Today wasnthe first day of dance class.n It was early August when we had just started high school. Kirstenndescribed our freshman year as \"The best year of our lives.\" She said highnschool was the next best thing to college, where you live on your own inndorm rooms. Kirsten seemed to be having the time of her life, and so didnGordon, but I didn't seem to see anything different about high school thannmiddle school. You switch classes, have lockers, and get assigned homework.nEverything seemed to be the same.n \"What do you mean it's the same?\" Gordon had asked me.n \" Yeah, we have a whole new dress code,\" Kirsten had agreed.n In middle school, the dress code wasn't necessary. They made us wear beltsnand tuck in our shirts. For a while we could only wear solid colorednshirts, but enough of the parents complained, so they changed it so that wencould wear any shirt. Kirsten insisted that tucking her shirt into hernpants made her hips look big, so she survived middle school by wearingndresses and overalls. According to Kirsten, high school was much betternthan middle school, but even if the dress code was different, all the othernrules were still the same.n \"Why are you in a hurry Anna?\"Gordon asked me.n \"Gordon, I've been talking about the first day of dance for weeks. See?\" Insaid, holding up my bag with my ballet and pointe shoes in it.n \"You're still doing dance?\" Kirsten asked surprised. \"I thought you werengoing to quit in high school because of all the homework.\"n \"No,\" I exclaimed. \" Besides, we have just as much homework as last year.\"n \"But Anna, it's only the third week of school. Real homework doesn't evennget assigned until the sixth week.\"n I knew that she was probably right, but I loved dancing and I wasn't goingnto quit. \"I'm sure I can handle it.\"n \"Okay,\" she said.n I rolled my eyes. Kirsten had been wanting for me to quit dance since thenseventh grade. She insisted that we never spent enough time together, evennthough I only danced two days a week. She'd really been trying to get me tonquit when she wanted to try out for the football team, but when the coachnsaid no, her parents had agreed that football just wasn't for girls. Indidn't really think that it was right. Just because her parents believednthat football wasn't for girls that she should be forced to give up herndreams and have to give up what she wanted to do, but Kirsten did seem tonhold her parents' choice against my choice, and she would always complainnabout how busy I was with dance. It was as if she wasn't allowed to do whatnshe enjoyed, I wasn't either.n \"Kirsten, it's only two days a week,\" I reminded her. \"Besides, you knownhow much this means to me. We can still hang out on the weekends.\"n \"It won't be the same. Anna, I know it won't,\" she said. \"All you'll talknabout are your pointe shoes, or complain about something.\"n I rolled my eyes. \"What if I promise you that I will not talk about dancenwhile I'm with you.\"n Kirsten had that glare in her eye. That glare that meant she was up tonsomething. \"What are you going to give me if you break that promise?\"n \"Uh, I'll give you ten dollars.\"n Kirsten held out her hand to shake on it. Normally, I don't gamble, but itnwas only ten dollars that I could easily earn back from allowance. I shooknKirsten's hand and then our discussion ended.n \"I'm glad that you guys are done with your argument,\" Gordon said as wenstepped outside into the parking lot. When we stepped outside, we werenimmediately greeted by the fresh scent of daisy's, which grew all aroundnthe school. The grass was cut very short and was never high, like a golfncorse. The bricks were a rusty red color and on the front of the buildingnwere the gold letters Lakedale High Schools. It seemed like one of thenschools that people dream about going to with everything in order andneverything in place, but it wasn't any different from any other school. Younstill got detention if you were misbehaving, you still got A's if younstudied, and you were sometimes late to class because of the bell.n Every day, after the last bell rang, the whole school let out at once, andneveryone in the school went out into the parking lot where the busses were,nalong with the cars. Once you spotted your ride, you immediately went to itnbefore they left. If by chance you missed your ride, they made you sit innthe principal's office until your parents came to pick you up. One time Inhad to stay after school for the A&B; club and they sent me to the office tongive Principal York a note. There was a group of boys there, all of whichnwere friends, and Mr. York was yelling at all of them for loitering onnschool property. I didn't know if it was like that every day, but I hopednnot. Once I told Kirsten and Gordon about this, we all made sure we nevernmissed our rides. If any of us were caught like that, we'd be grounded fornmonths, and if I were caught in that situation, I'd probably be kicked outnof the A&B; club.n \"Hey, I've got to go guys. My bus is here,\" Gordon said as he headedntoward the bus. I watched him run to the bus to be the first one on to getna back seat. It was cool for people to sit in the back seats at our schoolnbecause you were far from the bus driver. People only did it so they couldnbreak the rules, like talk on their cell phones. They did really crazynthings. I heard that one guy even mooned a truck driver. If you asked me,nI'd say it was all nonsense. I didn't understand why people thought it wasnneat and cool to break the rules. It only got you into trouble if you werencaught, and that's what people only thought. If you were caught. Theyndecided to take a fifty-fifty chance on it, and with as much security asnthere is today because of all the shoplifting and kidnaping, they shouldnknow that more than likely, they're going to be caught. I looked across the parking lot to find my mother waving at me to hurrynup.n \"Kirsten, I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow.\"n \"Good luck today,\" she said, but secretly, I knew she wanted me to donbadly so I would be kicked out of class. I just didn't understand it. Whyndoes she not like me to have fun without her?n \"Hey Anna,\" my mom said to me as I hopped into her car. \"Ready for thenfirst day of dance?\"n \"Yeah,\" I said feeling down. I didn't know how a person could go fromnfeeling so excited too so depressed instantly. The way that Kirsten hadnbeen so cross about me taking dance had affected me. It hurt that shencouldn't accept the fact that dancing was my sport, even if it wasn'tnconsidered cool in Lakedale. Dancing is what I did for fun. While everybodynelse tackled each other and scored a field goal, I spun turns and leapednjetes. It felt so painful that my best friend and I didn't see eye to eyenwith what to do after school. She acted as if ballet was something Inplanned to do my whole life. Sure dance was something I loved, but I didn'tnplan to make a career out of it. I wanted to be a journalist and write forna newspaper. Ballerinas had to stay on a special diet and had to be ancertain height. I was already 5'7, but I had about another inch to grow. Inwas already too tall to be a ballerina anyway. Sometimes, Kirsten madenme feel guilty, but after I thought about it for a while, I realized thatnit was silly to feel guilty to do something I loved. She really made menfeel guilty because she didn't dance. Since she wasn't able to playnfootball, something she loved and wanted to play, it made me feel sad thatnI was able to do what I loved either way. About the only thing Kirsten andnI could do together was swimming, but my mom had already closed up ournpool, so we had to weight until next summer.n It really hurt that Kirsten kept trying to get me to quit dancing. Shenjust didn't realize how much ballet made me happy. I had a few friends whontook dance with me, but they all went to different schools. I often wishednthat I could have just one friend who would hang out in our trio to talknabout dance with. Someone that would truly understand me and understood menfor who I was, not by what I did.n \"So how was school today?\" my mom asked me when we were halfway to thendance studio. Half the time, I thought my mom was physic. She knew when wenhad a bad day and she tended to stay quiet.n \"It was okay,\" I answered.n After about three minutes, my mom broke the long silence between us. \"Comenon Anna. You need to cheer up.\"n See, I told you, she's physic.n \"Oh, I'm fine, it's just Kirsten was a little disappointed that wencouldn't hang out today.\"n \"Oh,\" she said. \"Well, if that's it, than it's probably no big deal. Shenknows that you have dance classes two days a week just like the past twonyears.\"n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"She was just disappointed because she wanted to donsomething today, but I'm sure we can do it another day.\" I knew it wasn'tnthe whole truth, but I didn't want mom to ask what was wrong and for me tonhave to explain how I felt.n \"I guess you can. Your brother called me earlier and said he had a newngirlfriend.\"n I rolled my eyes. My older brother, Tim, had just gone to college. He wasnonly seventeen because he had skipped a grade and he had a new girlfriendnalmost every week. Tim always said that he was always in love with hisngirlfriend and knew that she was the one. If you asked me, I'd say thatnlove was really kind of stupid. It was something that teenagers pretendednto be in so they could be cool. Everyone, it seemed, had either a boyfriendnor a girlfriend and their relationships lasted two weeks tops. To me, lovenwasn't really serious until you couldn't stop thinking about the othernperson and you felt that you couldn't live without them, but sometimes, Insecretly wished, even on my birthday when it was time to blow out thencandles, that someone could love me. Not the type of love that teenagersnare in, but real love, like how you feel when you can't live without yournboyfriend and you couldn't even imagine how life without him would be, butnI knew that stuff like that was impossible at my age. After all, I was onlynfourteen.n I quicky grabbed my dance bag as we pulled into the parking lot. I wasnvery excited now. It's funny how you can go from being depressed onenminute, to be happy the next, and all it took for me was looking at ansmall, tiny studio with dancers inside getting ready to do warm-ups andnseeing their teacher again after the summer break.n \"Bye Anna, have fun. I'll pick you up at five thirty,\" mom said as I shutnthe door to the car. I turned around, holding my heavy bag, and faced thenstudio, ready to go inside. *~Chapter2~* I've always enjoyed coming to Lakedale Dance Academy, even since when Infirst started when I was four. Even though the studio had only one room, Instill enjoyed being there. It was located on the same highway that mynschool was on, just about five miles away. It was in one of those buildingsnwith several rooms to rent. I enjoyed the studio even more because a couplenrooms down was a Sub Depot. I'd been eating down there every week afterndance, and I knew Shirley, the manager, very well from all my visits. SincenI always went down there, she'd give me discounts and free water.n As soon as I saw my friend, Vicky, step out of her mom's car, I waved.n\"Hey, are you ready?\"n \"Yup,\" she said. \"As always.\"n We walked in the building together and stepped into two unoccupiedndressing rooms. The changing rooms were just closets with white curtainsnfor a door. I had always been a little uncomfortable changing in themnbecause all it would take is for a breeze from opening the door to make thencurtain fly up. I knew that it didn't matter any way, since it was just usngirls.n Class didn't start until four o' clock, and I had ten minutes to be ready.nI grabbed my new black leotard and jazz pants out of my bag to get dressed. \"We're here Jamie,\" I heard a woman say from outside my dressing room.n\"Don't worry. I'm sure you'll make new friends today. Now get in andressing room to get changed.\"n I heard the door shut and the rustle of curtains.n Poor Jamie, I thought. She must be so sad having to move to a new studionwhere she doesn't know anybody.n As soon as I was finished changing, I stepped outside and was immediatelyngreeted by a big mass of red hair.n \"Vicky!\" I exclaimed, laughing.n \"Sorry,\" she said smiling. \"I'm trying to put up my hair. It's so hard nownthat I've cut it.\"n Vicky tried to keep her hair in place by sticking dozens of butterflynclips on the back of her head with her hair flipped over. Then she quickynput her hair up in a ponytail. Once she lifted her head up, her hair wasnsticking out everywhere, but it was still out of her face.n \"How's that?\" she asked me.n \"Well, it's certainly up,\" I joked.n Vicky laughed, her cheeks red, which made her blue eyes appear even bluer.nVicky often complained about having red hair and blue eyes, but she didn'tnmind that she was full-blood Irish. I thought it was neat that all hernancestors came from Ireland. It was different with me. I was one eighthnIrish, three eighths Swedish, and one half Cherokee. It was reallynconfusing to figure out where my ancestors came from. The Cherokee Indiansnwere already in America when the English started coming over.n We all sat down by the stereo, waiting for our teacher, Buffy. Buffy wasnvery short and petite. I'd often wondered if she had even been a Ballerinanonce, but knew she hadn't. We had first come to the studio when it hadnfirst opened, and it was Buffy's first year teaching. She was very young atnthe time, I'd say about twenty-one because she had just graduated college.nEven if she had been a ballerina, she would have told us. Buffy told usneverything, even stuff that was embarrassing, like when she had gotten hernfirst pimple. She said it was big and red. She said that she thought thatnshe was going to die of skin cancer. We all had a laugh from that.n \"Hello class,\" Buffy said, smiling from ear to ear. \"I see that we'venchanged a lot over the summer.\"n I saw Vicky blush a little.n \"As you may know, Claire has moved to Utah and will not be having classesnwith us anymore.\"n Many people started whispering and asking each other \"Why?\"n \"Don't worry everyone,\" Buffy said, trying to quiet everyone down. \"Wenhave a new student who will be in class with us today.\"n \"Who?\" Rochelle, a girl who was very nosey, asked.n \"Jamie,\" Buffy said, \"will be attending our class today. Right now,nhowever, Jamie's in the dressing room changing, but will be out in ansecond.\"n I heard curtains rustle toward the front of the studio, but before I couldnturn around Buffy said, \"Ladies, Jamie is now ready to join class with us.\"n Everyone turned around to see a boy with brown curly hair wearing blacknpants and a T-shirt.n Immediately, everyone started whispering.n \"Why is he here?\"n \"Did he walk into the wrong building?\"n\"Maybe he meant to go to Sub Depot.\"n \"What if he tries to sneak in my dressing room?\"n\"What's with the name Jamie?\"n \"OH MY GOD HE'S A BOY!\" Rochelle yelled, causing everyone to laugh, evennJamie.n \"Well duh, Rochelle,\" Cindy, Rochelle's friend, hollered laughing.n I looked at Rochelle, to see if she was embarrassed, but I was surprisednnot to see her cheeks turning red. Rochelle always made everyone laugh,neven if she was a little nosey.n \"Okay class,\" Buffy said once the laughter died down. \"Since the last timenwe danced was in May, we're just going to do warm-ups out on the floor.nOnce we're done, we'll sit down and introduce ourselves to Jamie. Take younplace out on the floor while I try to find some music.\"n Vicky and I hurried so we could be beside each other.n \"I really want to know why he's a dancer,\" Vicky whispered to me.n \"I know what you mean,\" I replied.n There were two boys who were twins who started dancing with me when I wasneight, but they quit when they were ten because it was embarrassing fornthem at school. I didn't blame them either. It wasn't even cool for me tondance at school. Imagine how bad it would be for boys. They would be teasednand picked on, but girls wouldn't. It was just the opposite of football.nDancing was a girl's sport.n \"Who's going to dance with him if there is a duet? I know Buffy and she'llndo a duet with him and some girl, and it's not going to be me,\" Vicky saidnto me.n\"It won't be me either,\" I said. \"Not if I can help it.\" * * * \" I can't believe he's actually dancing,\" I said to both Kirsten and Gordonnas I sat down at the lunch table with them during lunch period. Why didnJamie think he could dance in ballet? Girls were more graceful than boysnwere, not to mention ballet was a girl thing. If you had asked anyone in myndance class, they would have said Jamie should have been in hip hop withnthe rest of the boys.n \"Who's he?\" Kirsten asked me, clueless.n \"Jamie. He's a new kid at our studio,\" I told her.n \"What's wrong with him dancing?\" Gordon asked. \"I do it all the time atnparties and concerts. What's wrong with a little funky dance moves?\"n I looked at him, \"He dances ballet. In my class as well. With us girls.\"n Kirsten seemed to get my point and looked disgusted. \"EW! Now I know whatnyou mean!\"n Gordon stared at us, confused. \"Uh, guys, you do realize that you'rendiscriminating against him?\"n \"So?\" I said. \"We're discriminated against as girls and you guys don'tneven realize how it feels until it happens to you.\"n I just didn't get it! I wasn't really discriminating against Jamie. I wasnjust making a point. Ballet was really a girl thing and it was freaky tonsee a guy doing it. It was like seeing a girl wearing a peace medallion waynto big for her around her neck with baggy pants, and a t-shirt way to bignfor her. If it wasn't bad enough, one of the girls in my ballet class wouldnbe dancing a duet with him for a dancing competition.n \"Class,\" Buffy had said the day before, \" since Jamie is dancing with usnfrom now on, I thought it would be neat if he performed a duet with one ofnyou girls for a statewide competition coming up in early November. Nextnweek, I will decide who will perform with him. Now, you don't have tonworry. I pretty much already know who it is, but on Thursday, we will do ancomplete warm-up and a few moves across the floor so I can be sure thenperson I choose is right.\"n \"I'm going to do badly on purpose,\" Vicky then whispered to me. \"That waynI know I won't be chosen.\"n \"I don't think I will,\" I said. \"She already knows who's going to be, sonit won't make a difference.\"n All I knew is that I was not going to be in the duet. It was hard enoughnto even dance in the same room with him. Imagine how even more embarrassingnit would be to dance a duet with him. If I did got chosen, I would justntell Buffy that it was impossible that I could make the practices, even ifnshe did know the real reason. I believed that Buffy knew that all the girlsndidn't like the idea of having a boy in their class, but then again, whatngirl did?n \"Yeah Gordon,\" Kirsten agreed with me. \"What they did to me on thenfootball team was discrimination. Did you even confront the coach about it?nNo! But you're going to confront Anna when she discriminated against guys!\"n \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" Gordon yelled. \"Sorry! I was just making a point! Stopnyelling at me!\"n We all started to laugh.n \"Sorry Gordon,\" I said, laughing.n \"Yeah, sorry,\" Kirsten said.n \"But with this Jamie guy in my class, things just couldn't get any worse,\"nI told them. Almost instantly, as if fate had planned it, I heard someonenyell \"Hey, Anna!\" from across the cafeteria.n I turned around and almost came face to face with Jamie!n \"Uh, Anna,\" Gordon said, \"I think it just got worse.\"n What was he doing here? At my school? He was already in my dance class.nWith my luck, he'd be in my gym class and see me in my gym clothes. What ifnhe was in any of my classes with Kirsten and me?n \"Do you mind if I sit here guys?\" Jamie asked us.n I couldn't just say no. After all, he was new at school, and he was in mynballet class. I was the only person he knew here so far. \"Sure,\" I said.n Jamie sat down right beside me. \"So,\" he said,\" What classes do you havenafter lunch?\"n \"Gym, English, and then geometry,\" I told him. \"Kirsten and Gordon havenEnglish and gym with me.\"n \"Cool! I have English with you guys,\" Jamie said. \"Mrs. Morgan, right?\"n \"Yeah,\" I said. At least he wouldn't have gym with me, and I wouldnactually prefer that because he wouldn't see me in my gym clothes. Itndidn't really matter though, because he would see me too days a week in antight leotard, and besides, I wouldn't be the only person in his Englishnclass with him. Kirsten and Gordon would be there too.n \"So,\" Gordon said, \" did you see the race on Sunday?\"n \"Oh yeah! It was awesome!\" Jamie cried.n Kirsten and I looked at each other. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea tonhave Jamie sit with us. Gordon would finally have something to talk aboutnbesides purses and make-up anymore. He could talk about guy stuff withnJamie instead of Kirsten and me.n Kirsten!n \"Oh crap!\" I yelled.n \"What,\" Jamie asked.n I reached into my purse and counted out ten dollars to give to Kirsten. \"Inowe Kirsten ten dollars.\"n Everyone laughed, except for Jamie, who was confused. Once we explained itnto him, he laughed too. We all sat and talked until the lunch bell rang,nand I had to admit, having lunch with Jamie wasn't as bad as I thought. Inthought it'd be completely boring because he's a dancer, and all he'd talknabout was how cool it was that we went to the same school and the samendance class, but he didn't. We all talked classes, gym teachers, movienstars, and even a little about tofu. Kirsten even liked him as much as Indid.n \"He's not that bad Anna. Not as bad as I thought,\" she whispered to menwhen Gordon and Jamie were talking about the races next Sunday.n I believe we were all a little disappointed when the bell rang to switch,nbecause we all groaned as we got up to put our trays away.n \"They just never seem to give you enough time do they?\" Kirsten said.n \"Nope. They never even give you close to how much you need,\" I answered.n \"We'll, I'm going to be going,\" Jamie said, \" I talk to you in English,\"n \"Ok buddy,\" Gordon said to him as we walked out of the cafeteria andnheaded to our lockers. Gordon had just called him buddy, but Jamie wasn'tnpart of our trio.I was once again mad at Jamie, and even a little confused.nHow could you automatically call someone your buddy just because they atenlunch with you once? Just because we sat at Lunch together didn'tnautomatically make him part of our group. Did it? Chapter 3 I sat outside Lakedale High, sitting on the steps leading up to thenschool. It was already four o' clock. Thirty-minutes past the time my momnwas supposed to pick me up. I didn't have dance today, and I was a littlenrelieved. I was still sore from the day before doing warm-ups. I wasnusually sore for the first two weeks after classes began, because of thenlong summer break without dancing for three months, but after a while, Inhardly broke a sweat.n I was still confused about Jamie. Gordon had called him \"buddy.\" He hardynknew Jamie. He knew me before he ever saw Jamie, and if it wasn't for me,nGordon wouldn't have even met Jamie. Gordon never called me \"buddy\" at all,nbut then again, all Kirsten and I ever talked about were make-up and boys,nsomething Gordon could care less about. But, never less, it didn't matter.nHow could you assume someone is your \"buddy\" by only eating lunch with himnonce? You can't judge a person by seeing them once. I thought, but as soonnas I thought that, my stomach started aching. I figured out why Gordon wasncomplaining about me discriminating against Jamie. I'd never really met thenguy, I'd only danced two hours in a dance class with him.n Oh, Anna, I thought. How could you do this? If Jamie knew what you reallynthought about him, he'd be really disappointed.n I wondered over and over again how I could stoop down to the level of thensoutherners back during the time of slavery? How could I be so mean tonsomeone? I wasn't too sure if Jamie could forgive me if he ever found outnhow I'd been complaining about him to my friends, but hopefully, Gordon andnKirsten wouldn't blow my secret. I then decided, I wouldn't complain aboutnJamie so much. I mean, after all, he did have the guts to dance ballet whennit wasn't even cool for me, so that was one good thing about him. He wasn'tnashamed to do something he loved, and no one could change his mind.n Maybe Jamie isn't so bad after all, I thought. And besides, just because Indon't mind the fact so much that he's a dancer, doesn't mean that I'm goingnto dance in the duet with him.n To be honest, I wasn't too thrilled about Buffy's choice to make a girlndance a duet with him because it seemed cute. Not to mention, dancing withna boy, in any way to me, seemed romantic, and you were supposed to be innlove with the other person in order to dance right. You have to feel thenmusic and be able to dance with a partner that you're comfortable with innorder to become part of the music, to sway and flow with the music, justnlike you are a part of the chorus and lyrics, only the part that's visiblento the human eye. You are the dancer, and you must entertain your audience,nand the only way that you can truly do that, is to become part of thenmusic. It's very similar to people who write, paint, or play an instrument.nPeople who do these things know that you have to become part of your worknto be able to make your work come to life for the viewer, and Buffy,nmaking one of the girls dance with Jamie, just simply couldn't be done.n Okay Anna, I told myself, Even though you don't mind Jamie as much as youndid, you will not dance in the duet with him.n I heard the door to the front of the building slam shut, but I didn'tnbother to turn around. I had no business to see who it was. My onlynbusiness was to wait for my mom to come and pick me up.n \"Hey Anna,\" someone yelled from behind me. I turned around at the mentionnof my name, and came face to face with Jamie. All the guiltiness I feltnearlier was gone, and I despised Jamie with every nerve in my body.n \"Hey,\" I said flatly.n \"Did you get the English assignment that Ms. Morgan assigned today?\" henasked. How dare he? I thought. All he wants do is copy off my work, and seenhow I got it.n \"Yes, it's fairly easy. Diagraming sentences. It's just review,\" Inanswered.n \"Oh,\" he mumbled. \"Well, I get a little confused with the adjective andnadverb part. I always get them confused, I'll get my mom to help me withnthat,\" he paused a second, as if debating what to say. \" Are you excitednabout Buffy making a girl dance with me for a duet?\"n \"No, nobody in the class is,\" I answered.n \"Yeah, I didn't want to do it either, but my mom is making me. She thinksnit'll be sweet and precious. Sometimes, I don't get her. She's the reasonnthat I'm dancing. If she hadn't signed me up when I was five, I wouldn'tnhave fallen in love with it, and now I'm stuck either way,\" he said, as ifnhe were complaining to me. How pathetic!n \"Well, I started dancing because I thought it was fun, and it was,\" thisntime, my voice wasn't as harsh and cruel as it had been before. Why, Indidn't know. He had taken my best friend, and now they seemed tight. Indidn't understand it, one minute I hated his guts, the next, I forgave him,nand then, what do you know, I like him again. Life was weird sometimes, andnpeople try so hard to figure out why, but even then it seems confusing asnthey try to figure out.n \"Anna, did you here me?\"n My thoughts were interrupted by Jamie waving his hand over and over innfront of my face. I looked at him. \"Sorry, I was thinking. What did younsay?\"n \"I asked you if you were doing anything this Saturday? Because my sisternhas two extra tickets to this theme park down the street. She bought anpacket of four, and she only needed two for her date, but she decided tonbring me along because Mom wouldn't let her go alone. Do you want to come?\"nhe asked, the little puppy dog face hidden beneath his tan, pimple-freenface. I couldn't say no. Thinking about how he would complain to Gordonnabout how I rejected him, and imagining about how hurt he'd be, made mengive in. Besides, Tim had to go somewhere Saturday anyway, and he couldneasily drop me off.n \"Sure,\" I replied, feeling guilty that I was probably confusing him andnthat he would think that I liked him, so I added \"As friends.\"n Just then, a car pulled up. I looked inside, and saw my brother Timnsitting in the driver's seat and hopped up to go.n \"I have to go now. My brother's here,\" I replied.n \"Bye, see you at dance practice tomorrow,\" he yelled.n I quickly ran over to my brother's car as fast as I could, trying to getnas far away as possible from Jamie. I opened the door, and hopped into thencar.n \"Hey kiddo, what's new?\" he asked me.n \"Nothing much,\" I answered. This was pretty much how all our conversationsnwent. Tim and I never really had those heart to heart conversations thatnsome siblings had, but we did have some kind of relationship. It was callednyou do your thing, and I'll do mine.n Then, it came to me. Out of thin air, it just came. I had a plan, well,nnot really a plan, plans are used to hurt people, but I had an idea thatncould get me Jamie free for that night, and still have a blast. I could asknKirsten and Gordon to come with me. Gordon could hang with his knew \"buddy\"nwhile Kirsten and I walked around the park rating guys 1-10 like we usuallyndid on Saturday nights.n It was brilliant! If I didn't know that I had thought of it myslef, Inwould thought Kirsten had made it up (She always has to deal withnsituations like these. After all, she had a boyfriend every other week.)n I quickly reached down and grabbed my brother's cell phone.n \"Need to make a call?\" he asked. It was the stupidest question anyone hadnever asked me, aside from this boy in third grade trying to be cute askingnme what my gender was.n \"No, I'm selling it for drugs,\" I said sarcastically. I dialed Kirsten'sncell. As if on cue, she answered immediately.n \"Hey Kirsten, want to go to a carnival on Saturday?\" I asked and explainednthe situation, leaving out the parts about Jamie.n \"Okay, sure. I'll call Gordon immediately. I know he'll be thrilled.nAnother night out with us talking about boys,\" She agreed.n I laughed. Amazingly, I had this feeling in my stomach. I kind of felt sadnthat my date with Jamie was going to be ruined. Wait a minute! What was Intalking about! This wasn't a date! We were only friends.[Chapter 2] Chapter 4 As soon as I got home, I rushed upstairs and grabbed my pointe shoes. Inpracticed everyday after school. It was like a routine I had going on. Inwoke up, went to school, came home ( or to Lakedale Dance Academy),npracticed, ate, crammed in on my homework, and crashed. As I put on my left shoe however. I realized that I hadn't told Jamie aboutnKirsten and Gordon coming, and I still wasn't sure if Gordon was evenncoming. I didn't really feel like calling him, but durin English class thenguy had given me his phone number, and it wouldn't be right to just to haventhe two of them show up Friday without him even knowing. Hezittantly, Ingrabbed the phone, and dialed his number. \"Hello?,\" came a voice. It sounded like his mother. Oh great! She wouldnthink I was some admirer or something! \"um, yes, is Jamie there. This is Anna,\" I said. \"Oh, so your this Anna I've heard so much about. Just a minute sweetie,\"nshe said into the phone. I heard her yell Jamie's name at the top of hernlungs. In a few minutes, Jamie was on the line. \"Hey Anna, what's new for you innthe past ten minutes?\"he asked. \"Oh, nothing really,\"I answered. \"Oh, well, I can't wait until Friday,\"he said. \"About that,\" I said. \"I was talking to Kirsten about it, and she had toncome with me. But don't worry, she invited Gordon too, so you won't have tondeal with two excited girls alone.\" He laughed At the joke, even though it wasn't at all funny. \"Well, is thatnall you wanted to tell me?\" \"well, yes, actually. I just didn't want you to be freaking out whennKirsten showed up on Friday with us,\" US!US! Why was I saying us! Itnsounded like we were a couple or something! \"oh, okay. Hey about that English work, I'm having a little trouble onnthat, do you mind helping my a little?\" he asked. \"oh, no, of corse not,\" I said. \"What do you need help on?\" I don't know exactly how long I was on the phone, but durin the whole time,nthe subject changed from Adverbs to Ballet to Cheeze Puffs. I was surprisedna couple times to find myself laughing. \"Anna, time for supper,\" my mother yelled. What! I Thought. I looked at the clock at the side of my bed and itnsaid 6:30. \"Oh crap, its already supper time. Got to go. See ya Jamie .\" Okay see you\" Was it just me, or were we both sad that I had to go? ~~~~~~~~~The next day in dance class~~~~~~~~~ \"Okay class, you can all sit and rest. In a few minuted I'll tell you guysnwho made the solo part.\" Buffy said to us in class. I was relieved. I wasndrenched in sweat! I had worn myself out by doing so many turns. I lookednat Vikki, and didn't see any sign of her being hot or worn out at all. \"why'd you do everything so perfect today? I told you that Buffy wouldnprobably look at the girl who worked the hardest today, and just lok atneveryone else,\" she said. I looked at everyone. All of them looked as ifnthey could run in the Olympics races and win, even Claudia, the classnflirt. For the first time ever, I felt weird in the studio. \"Class, I've thought about this a lot, and I've made my decision final.nAnna will be performing the solo with Jamie. She seems to me to be thenhardest worker, and I believe that her and Jamie would be perfect for thisnpart,\" Buffy said. Everyone clapped. As they clapped, each time their handsntouched, it felt like they were slapping me in the face, saying \"I told younso\". \"Of corse, you must agree to it first. You do realize you will have tongive up every other Saturday and a little bit of time after class. Is itnokay for you guys?\"Buffy asked. \"Yes,\" said Jamie, his eyes showing excitement like a three year oldnreceiving candy. I would hate to make him disappointed. \"sure\" I replied. Author's Note: I'm sorry I haven't added this in a while. I tried to spacenit out a little, and I used less detail in this chapter. I guess you cannstill get the main idea.

It was supposed to be a new life with everything that happened when he was 10 years old far behind him. He shouldn't have listened to Kaylie. He shouldn't have gone back in. But if he didn't, he would have been forever trapped in a lie he was made to have thought happened. \"Russell. You've got a visitor.\" The warden snapped him out of his own thoughts and he turned to see a girl, standing next to the warden. She wasn't older than him. In fact, she was just about his age. He didn't know who she was and he wasn't going to find out. Ever since his story made the papers, there have been many visits from girls who were interested to find out about him. Some even pledging to be his as soon as he gets out. \"Tony, I don't know who this person is.\" Tim said \"But I know who you are.\" She said Tim sighed, \"As do many of the other girls who come in here. For the hundredth time, I am not interested.\" She looked at Tony and whispered, \"He's feeling a little stressed out… I dumped him in high school so he is pretty pissed with me since then. Could you let us talk in private for a while?\" \"Fine. But if he starts behaving funny, you let me know.\" Tony said She nodded and he moved towards the other corner of the dayroom, out of earshot. After which, she turned to look at Tim. \"Look, I know you've been harassed ever since you got admitted for the second time. But, trust me. I'm not like the other girls.\" She said Tim looked at her, \"That's what number 51 said.\" She sighed, \"My name is Ryley Lee - spelt with a y instead of an i.\" \"Nice to meet you, Ryley Lee - spelt with a y instead of an i. But, I'm not interested in another girl pledging herself to me.\" Tim said She cocked an eyebrow, \"Okay, first of all, nice to meet you. Secondly, eww. I am not here for that. I'm a reporter with The New York Times and I'm here to investigate your side of the story.\" \"My side of the story?\" Tim said \"Your last words after being arrested were that 'the mirror did it'.\" Ryley said \"I was delusional.\" Tim said Ryley shook her head, \"No, you were not.\" \"Yes, I was.\" Tim said, \"The doctors helped me out and I now know that I was delusional.\" \"No. You're not. I believe what you said.\" Ryley said Just as Tim was beginning to process what she had just told him, Tony came back over. \"Sorry miss. Time's up.\" Tony said \"Oh, that's alright Tony. I managed to get him to not be pissed with me anymore.\" Ryley said, \"In fact, Tim here told me to come back tomorrow. I think we're gonna be friends again.\" Tim looked at her and she gave him a look that told him to go with it. \"Um, yeah. Could you tell Dr Graham that I'd love to have a private chat with my friend?\" Tim asked \"I'll ask but no promises.\" Tony said Ryley smiled, \"It is definitely better than nothing. Thank you, Tony!\" The big guy smiled at the two of them before ushering Ryley out of the dayroom. But, before she left, she slipped a piece of paper into Tim's hands. As soon as the door to the dayroom closed, Tim turned back to the window - faking interest in the outside as he slowly opened the note. He looked down and read the note. Despite the scribbly writing; from the haste Ryley was in, he was able to make out the words. In bold black were the words, 'I believe you. I've seen it too.'[Chapter 2] Tim paced the room Doctor Graham had allowed him to use. He was anxious to hear what Ryley had to say. After all that happened to him, he always thought he was alone in the world. But suddenly, this girl pops up and tells him that she's seen it too? It was more than he could hope for – a person who genuinely understood what he was going through. The door to the room opened and Tony stood by the door as Ryley walked in with a backpack on her shoulders. \"There he is.\" Tony said, \"Doctor Graham said this is good for him. So he's given you two about 3 hours to catch up. But, if you need any more time, let me know.\" Ryley turned and smiled, \"Three hours is good enough, thanks Tony.\" Tony smiled at Ryley and gave her a curt nod before closing the door behind him. As soon as the door closed, Ryley stepped forward. \"Hi.\" Ryley said, \"So, you read the note?\" \"Why else would I be here?\" Tim asked \"Right.\" Ryley said, \"Look, I'm not the enemy here. The mirror is. And I assure you, I'm not here to waste your time. Like what the note says, I have seen it.\" \"What do you mean? You had it in your possession?\" Tim asked \"Wouldn't I be so lucky, right? But, no. It wasn't in my possession. But, my uncle did have it.\" Ryley replied \"How would you have seen it then?\" Tim asked Ryley sighed and gestured to the sofa, \"Take a seat. It's gonna be a long story.\" September 1993 – one year after the Russell's incident \"Ryley! Can you help your cousin with the boxes?\" A 10-year old Ryley smiled, \"Sure, aunt Diana.\" Her aunt smiled at her as Ryley raced out to the yard to help her cousin pick up one of the boxes off the floor. \"You know, I can handle this by myself.\" Her cousin, Brittany said \"I know, but two's always better than one, right?\" Ryley said Brittany gave Ryley a toothy smile as the two made their way up the front porch, just as her uncle, Brittany's dad came out the front door. \"Whoa! Look at these two strong ladies! I've never seen two 10-year olds so strong before!\" The two girls giggled as he reached over to help them with the box but pretended to fall at the extreme weight of it. \"Wow! Even I can't lift it! You two are amazing!\" He said The girls laughed as Brittany said, \"Dad, these are just my toys.\" \"Your toys must weigh a ton then! I can barely lift them!\" He said, \"I better go get the other lighter items since I'm not as strong as the mighty Brittany and Ryley!\" The girls giggled as he walked off the porch towards the back of the moving truck. They both made their way to Brittany's bedroom and placed the box on the ground. The two girls collapsed on Brittany's bed for a breather just as they heard the two adults downstairs. The girls looked at each other as they heard the adults yelling instructions at each other, as if moving something very heavy into the house. As if telepathically agreeing with each other, the two of them leapt of the bed and headed towards the staircase railing outside of Brittany's room. Through the space between the railings, the two girls saw Brittany's parents moving something big in. They couldn't see what it was since it had a cloth covering it, but, whatever it was, it seemed precious. \"What's that?\" Ryley whispered to Brittany Brittany shrugged, \"I don't know… I've never seen it before.\" \"Did Uncle Brian buy it for the house?\" Ryley asked \"Maybe… I heard mommy saying she wanted something new for the house.\" Brittany said \"Honey, turn to the left! We'll put it by the fireplace.\" Uncle Brian said Aunt Diana nodded and made the left turn. The girls watched till they disappeared from view. As they looked at each other questioningly, they heard their names being called from downstairs. \"BRITTANY! RYLEY! COME ON DOWN! WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU!\" The girls looked at each other, excitement slowly clouding their brains. They leapt up with joy and hurried down the stairs, racing into the living room. Standing in front of the newly mounted item, aunt Diana and uncle Brian beamed at them with as much excitement. \"Girls, we want you to see something we just bought!\" Aunt Diana said, \"We picked it out when we left you with your nana.\" \"Are you girls excited? Wanna see what it is?\" Uncle Brian asked \"YES!\" The two girls exclaimed Aunt Diana and uncle Brian both had their hand on the cloth. Turning to the girls, they both counted '1.. 2.. 3!' before tugging hard on the cloth. The cloth slowly moved down the item rapidly and right before their eyes stood an antique mirror. \"Whoa…\" Brittany said Ryley took in the look of the mirror and almost immediately felt uncomfortable. \"Well? What do you think?\" Aunt Diana asked \"It's so cool!\" Brittany exclaimed Ryley stared at it, fear starting to grow within her for no reason. \"What about you, Ryley?\" Uncle Brian asked She didn't answer. \"Ryley?\" Aunt Diana said, \"Are you okay?\" Worried that something is happening to their niece, uncle Brian immediately put a hand to her forehead, snapping Ryley out of her self-induced trance. \"Are you okay, Ryley? Do you want me to call your parents?\" Uncle Brian asked \"No… I'm okay..\" Ryley replied \"Alright. Maybe you've had too much excitement for today. Let's get you fed.\" Uncle Brian said Ryley nodded as her uncle took her hand and led her towards the kitchen. As she walked towards the kitchen, she turned around to look at the mirror again. Only this time, she noticed a crack at the right corner of the mirror. She obviously didn't know how it got there but she didn't have a good feeling about it. \"Ryley? Are you okay?\" She looked up and sitting in front of her was Tim, looking at her worriedly. \"What happened?\" Ryley asked \"You were talking about the mirror in the house and then you started crying.\" Tim replied Ryley felt the area around her eyes and they were wet with tears. \"If you're not comfortable to continue, it's alright.\" Tim said Ryley shook her head, \"No. I'm good. You need to know what I know and I'm going to finish telling my story.\"[Chapter 3] The 10-year old Ryley woke up to the sound of silence. She wasn't sure what caused her to wake from her slumber but being an inquisitive kid, it didn't matter. She sat up in her bed, squinting at the darkness. She looked in the direction of her cousin's bed but she wasn't up. But, that didn't stop her from calling out to her. \"Brittany…\" Ryley called out softly, \"Brittany? Are you awake?\" Brittany moved in her bed, turning over but not waking up. Ryley decided to go down to the kitchen anyway to get a glass of water since she was feeling rather thirsty. She walked down the stairs slowly, so as not to wake anyone up. She was on her last step on the stairs when she saw the flickering shadow of some sort of light coming from the sitting room, where the fireplace was. Curious, Ryley got off the last step and walked quietly in the direction of the fireplace. She wasn't sure what she was going to find but she had mentally prepared herself to see her aunt and uncle sitting on the couch, reading a book – since everyone in the family were bookworms. But the sight that greeted her instead, made her stop dead in her tracks. Aunt Diana stood in front of the newly installed mirror, as if she was frozen, with her hands by her side. Ryley couldn't see what she was doing from the position she was standing but she didn't have the desire to move for a better view. She wanted to call out to her but she hesitated. Ryley felt that something wasn't right. The air in the room suddenly seemed so stifling. So, instead of continuing on her path to get the glass of water, Ryley opted to return to her bed. Fear slowly crept into her consciousness as she back tracked slowly towards the stair case, not wanting to disturb her aunt. Something inside her was telling her that the lady standing in front of the mirror wasn't her aunt and she best get out of there as soon as she could. She almost reached the stairs when her butt bumped into the side table. The keys in the bowl jiggled and Ryley froze in panic. \"Please, no…\" Ryley whispered to herself. She slowly looked up and her eyes met with those of her aunt which were locked in a sinister gaze. Ryley gave herself no time to panic as she scrambled up the stairs and into her cousin's room, locking the door behind her. She slid to the floor against the door and hugged her knees to herself. What just happened? Was that her aunt Diana? It looked like her but it felt like it wasn't really her. Ryley felt all the questions swim around in her mind and closed her eyes tight. She didn't move an inch as she sat rooted to the spot, cradling herself as a way of comfort and slowly rocking herself to sleep. \"Ryley?\" She jerked awake, her sudden movement causing her shoulders to hit the door. She looked at her cousin, who stepped back slightly in surprise at her reaction. \"Ryley? Are you okay?\" Brittany asked. Ryley blinked a couple of times, trying to regain her bearings as she nodded. \"Yeah...\" \"Are you sure? Have you been sleeping like this the whole night?\" Brittany asked with genuine concern. Ryley nodded slowly, feeling her muscles ache from the position she had kept by the door. As she closed her eyes, the image of her aunt's sinister look came back to her. Ryley opened her eyes immediately as Brittany sat down next to her. \"What happened, Ryley?\" Brittany asked. \"Did something happen? You don't look so good… We should go tell daddy or mommy that you are not feeling well.\" Ryley shook her head. \"We can't…\" Brittany sensed Ryley's hesitation and moved to hold her hand. \"Don't worry. Mommy and daddy will bring you to the doctor.\" \"Brittany… I am not sick. I just-I think something's wrong with aunt Diana.\" Ryley said. Her cousin frowned. \"What do you mean?\" Ryley clasped her hands together tightly. \"I was going to get a glass of water to drink last night… When I came down, I saw Aunt Diana standing in front of the mirror.\" \"The one daddy bought?\" Brittany asked. Ryley nodded as she squeezed her own left hand tighter. Brittany shook her head in disbelief. \"Why would mommy be standing in front of that mirror in the middle of the night?\" Ryley shrugged. \"I don't know. But you have to believe me, Brittany. What I saw was real. I thought I could go back up without making a sound but I accidentally bumped into the table with the keys and she turned around.\" Brittany gave her a slightly impish grin. \"Did mommy scold you? Is that why you are acting like this?\" \"No.\" Ryley said. \"Brittany, she didn't say anything. She just… stared at me.\" \"What do you mean stared at you? Was mommy sleepwalking?\" Brittany asked. Ryley shook her head, \"No… She wasn't.\" \"Well, maybe you were tired and seeing things.\" Brittany said. \"I wasn't! Okay, if you don't believe me, let's ask Aunt Diana about it.\" Ryley said. The two girls headed down for breakfast and Brian smiled seeing them arrive. \"There you two are…\" Uncle Brian said. \"I was beginning to think you two overslept.\" Ryley stopped walking for a bit as soon as she saw Aunt Diana. Brittany stopped and looked at Ryley. \"Come on.\" Aunt Diana turned to the girls. \"We've got scrambled eggs and pancakes. Your favorite combination, Ryley.\" Brittany lightly nudged Ryley and she started walking towards the table. They took their seats and as soon as Aunt Diana filled her plate, Ryley didn't feel like eating anymore. Her mind started to race through the possibilities of bringing up what she saw the night before. But before she could, her uncle spoke. \"Honey, where did you get that?\" Uncle Brian asked. Aunt Diana put down the pan with the scrambled eggs to examine her left hand. She shrugged, \"I don't know… I think I got it this morning when I was making breakfast?\" Uncle Brian took a hold of Aunt Diana's hand and looked at the wound a little closer. \"It doesn't look like an injury you get in the kitchen…\" He said. \"It looks like you scratched yourself.\" Aunt Diana took back her hand and waved her husband's worry away like it was some sort of bad air. \"Nonsense. I have never injured myself in my sleep before. I must have gotten this when I was being careless. It's noting.\" Brittany looked at Ryley, who looked intently at Aunt Diana's left hand. She remembered seeing that wound last night and by the looks of it, the wound looked fresh when Aunt Diana stood in front of the mirror. Not being able to eat at all, Ryley stood up to excuse herself. \"Uncle Brian, Aunt Diana… I'm not feeling very hungry. Can I borrow the phone to call my mom?\" Ryley asked. Although slightly confused with his niece's sudden loss of appetite, Uncle Brian nodded. \"The phone's in the study.\" Ryley gave them a small smile before heading towards the study. As she walked pass the mirror towards the study, she couldn't help but feel more uncomfortable then before. She shook her head and hurriedly made her way to the study, not wanting to be in the presence of the mirror another second longer. That night, Ryley packed up her suitcase with Brittany's help. She had called her parents to tell them that she wasn't feeling very comfortable living away from them anymore and her mother immediately cut short their weekend trip to come get her the next morning. \"Are you really going to go?\" Brittany asked. Ryley nodded. \"Yes. I don't like the mirror.\" \"It's just a mirror, Ryley. What could happen?\" Brittany said, sitting down on the bed next to Ryley's suitcase. Ryley closed her suitcase and shook her head. \"I don't want to know what will happen. Whatever it is, I think there is something wrong with that mirror. Did you see that crack by the corner?\" \"Maybe someone dropped the mirror before that.\" Brittany said. \"What makes you think that?\" Ryley said. Brittany shrugged, \"The mirror looks old. There's bound to be someone who dropped the mirror while carrying it.\" \"If they did that, the mirror would have a bigger crack, right? Not a small crack at the corner.\" Ryley said. Brittany sighed. \"Alright, alright… I'm going to miss you.\" \"Me too.\" Ryley said. \"Let's get some sleep.\" \"Ryley! Brittany! Wake up!\" The two girls were rudely awakened by a male voice and they sat up to see Uncle Brian standing by their beds. \"Daddy?\" Brittany said. \"Get up, quick!\" Uncle Brian said. \"What's going on, Uncle Brian?\" Ryley asked. He pushed the two girls into the closet. \"Stay in here and don't make a sound. Whatever happens, don't open this door. Do you understand?\" \"Daddy?\" Brittany said, tears in her eyes. \"You are scaring me.\" Uncle Brian looked at her and kissed her on the top of her head. \"I love you, bunny.\" Brittany tried to hold on to her father's arm but he pulled it out of her grasp and closed the door. The cousins huddled close together as they heard Uncle Brian's footsteps descend down the staircase. Despite their growing fear, they kept quiet as they tried to listen in on what was happening in the house. \"Diana, what are you doing?\" \"It's none of your business.\" \"Diana. Stop it. Give me the knife.\" \"Why? So you can tell me what to do again?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm sick of you telling me to do this and telling me to do that. I am your wife not your slave.\" \"Diana… Let's talk about this. Put the knife away. You are going to scare the girls.\" \"Scare the girls? Not if I got rid of you.\" \"What? Don't.. St-\" Ryley covered her mouth to stop herself from screaming. She couldn't see what was happening but she had a few guesses on what transpired. Silence crept into the house for a few seconds. \"I said I didn't like you telling me what to do.\" Brittany looked at her cousin, tears streaming down her face. \"Where's daddy? Did mommy kill daddy?\" Ryley shook her head, tears staining her cheek too. \"I don't know…\" \"I need to go and see!\" Brittany said. \"No, Brittany. Don't!\" Ryley said. She grabbed onto her cousin's hand but Brittany forcefully pulled Ryley's hand off her arm. She pushed open the door and ran down the staircase. Worried, Ryley followed after. She stopped at the top of the staircase as she got a good look of what had happened. Her uncle lay there in a pool of blood with Aunt Diana sitting on top of the body. Her clothes were stained crimson red and the knife in her hand glistened with fresh blood. Brittany was standing at the bottom of the staircase, shock overcoming her. \"Mommy?\" Brittany said. Her mother looked up at her and smiled. \"Hi honey.\" \"You killed daddy.\" Brittany said. \"Oh, oh, no honey… I-I…\" Aunt Diana looked around her, seemingly confused at what had happened. She looked back at her daughter and opened up her arms. \"Come here, honey… I was trying to save daddy. But, he ran into the knife.\" She said. Ryley was frozen in fear. She wanted to run out of the house but she couldn't do anything. Her feet stuck to the ground. Brittany looked at her mother and hesitated. She just lost her father and she didn't want to lose her mother. Slowly, Brittany went forward to hug her mother. That was when she saw the mirror, leaning against the wall. \"Mommy… Why is the mirror here?\" Brittany asked. \"Sssh. It's here to watch us.\" Diana replied. Before Brittany could say anything else, her mother lifted the knife and stabbed her in the back. Ryley screamed loudly and her aunt looked up at her. Motivated by fear and not wanting her aunt to catch her, she ran back into the closet and closed the doors, covering her ears in the process. She leaned against the closet doors with her eyes closed. She didn't want to know what was going to happen to her next. Ryley kept praying for it to just be a nightmare but everything about it seemed so real. Just as she felt the tears stream down her face, she heard her name being called. \"Ryley… Tell them I'm sorry.\" That was the last words she heard before there was silence and Ryley fainted due to shock. \"I found her!\" Ryley woke up to see a police officer kneeling beside her. The closet doors were open and she could see a couple of police officers in Brittany's room. \"Sweetie, are you okay?\" She didn't reply. \"I think she's in shock. We're gonna need a paramedic here.\" The police officer said. Within two minutes, the paramedics came up to where Ryley was and got her onto the gurney with the oxygen mask over her face. \"You're going to be okay.\" The female paramedic said. \"Just keep your eyes on me, okay?\" Ryley nodded and the paramedics brought the gurney out of the room and down the stairs. As they moved pass where her uncle's body was, Ryley broke eye contact with the paramedic as her gaze wandered over to where Brittany lay. She quickly looked away, only to see her aunt's body right in front of the mirror, with the knife sticking out from her stomach. She leaned back against the pillow on the gurney and started to feel her pulse race. \"She's going into shock again. Guys, we need to get her out of here, fast!\" The female paramedic said. She looked back at Ryley, \"Hey, stay with me sweetie. We can't lose you.\" Ryley couldn't reply as she lost consciousness just as she saw her panicking mother run up to her.[Chapter 4] Ryley looked at Tim, blinking away the tears and memory of the event that happened. Even though it happened years ago, she could never forget her aunt kneeling in front of the mirror. Tim opened his mouth to speak, but each time he did, he would second-guess the words he wanted to use. He had experienced the same cruel event the mirror put them through, but the only difference was he had his sister with him. She had no one. \"Tim?\" He snapped out of his own thoughts and looked at Ryley. \"Uh-yeah.. Sorry. I-I'm trying to find the right words to say here.\" Ryley gave a small laugh in disbelief. \"There is no right words to say to anyone who's been through what we have.\" \"Look, I'm not here to hold your hands and sing kumbaya with you while we remininse about a mirror that ruined our lives.\" Tim held back the urge to chuckle at her description of the scenario that they were in and sat up straight. \"I know. You're here for the article.\" \"Oh. Right.\" She said. He frowned. \"You're not a reporter with The New York Times here to do a story about me?\" \"W-Well... Yes and no.\" Ryley bit her lip. \"I am a reporter with The New York Times but I didn't come here to do a story about you. That's just a cover.\" \"For?\" Tim asked. \"Getting you out of here.\" Ryley replied. Tim immediately stood up from where he was sitting and walked across the room. \"You're crazy.\" \"I am not. I am going to get you out of here.\" Ryley said. \"How? By breaking me out? In case you haven't realized, this is a mental institution. I believe you'll have 5 male guards hold you down even before leaving.\" Tim said. Ryley rolled her eyes. \"I'm not stupid. Getting you out of here didn't mean break you out of an asylum. I'm here with a proposal.\" He cocked an eyebrow and waited for her to continue. \"I spoke to a friend of mine who says she can have you checked out of the institution and placed under her care.\" She said. Tim shook his head, unable to process the information Ryley was giving him. \"In case you don't realize, I am in this facility because prison wasn't an option for me. You think they are going to let you and your friend have me checked out?\" Tim said. \"Well, no.\" Ryley said. \"Unless you have a friend who's a DA and another friend who is a clinical psychologist.\" He almost wanted to believe he could get out. It was his only chance to stop pretending he was the problem. Standing here in front of him was his ticket out. So, why was he hesitating? She stood up and moved closer to him. \"Look. I know this is probably the weirdest approach you've ever experienced from someone you hardly know but I need to get you out of this place if we're ever going to find answers.\" \"Answers?\" He said. \"About the mirror.\" She said. \"I've been doing some research about it and I finally narrowed down some leads.\" He sighed and looked at her. \"So your next move is to track it down and do an experiment on it.\" \"What? No, I-\" Tim held up his hand and stopped her from continuing. \"I've been down that road before and let me tell you, it doesn't end well. Heck, that's actually the reason why I'm here.\" \"But I-\" He walked over to the door and pounded 2 times, loud enough for Tony to hear. \"Wait. Just hear me out.\" Ryley said. The door opened. \"I'm done, Tony.\" Tim said. \"I'm ready to head back to my room now.\" Tony nodded at him and made way for him to exit before following behind. Ryley hurriedly grabbed her backpack and ran out of the room. She just about caught a glimpse of Tim's back but he was too far off for her to say what she wanted to say without getting caught. She sighed and pulled off her visitor's badge in anger. She needed to convince him to accept her proposition. Ryley thought for a bit before pulling her iPhone out. She sent a quick text to her friend before walking to the reception to return her badge. Since Plan A didn't work, it was time to put Plan B, or what could be considered part of a plan, into action.[Chapter 5]  ","Summary":" \"Miss Lee?\" She stood up from her seat, outside the day room; readjusting her blouse. \"Yes, that"},{"Movie":"100 Days with Mr. Arrogant 내 사랑 싸가...","Title":"인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱 인천스파 인천키스방 인천건마 인천안마방","Author":"a6v521d65s","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13226213","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방 ","Summary":" 인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방∴인천건마｜인천안마방인천오피 uuhaja6닷com 『유유닷컴』 주특기 인천풀싸롱⊥인천스파→인천키스방"},{"Movie":"100 Days with Mr. Arrogant 내 사랑 싸가...","Title":"김해오피 유유닷컴 김해오피 김해키스방 김해1인샵 김해안마방 건마사이트","Author":"bnmmn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13239977","Passage":"[Chapter 1]  ","Summary":" "},{"Movie":"100 Days with Mr. Arrogant 내 사랑 싸가...","Title":"부산오피 uuhaja7닷com 밤문화후기 유유닷컴 부산안마방 부산오피 부산키스방 부산립카페","Author":"ab7hvegt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13215501","Passage":"[Chapter 1]  ","Summary":" "},{"Movie":"Others","Title":"Legolas and Tauriel (Friendship or Love)","Author":"Thehobbitandlordoftheringsfan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11721613","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (Takes place after The Hobbit Battle of the five armies. The scene with Legolas and Thranduil has just finished) Legolas looked at his father for the last time and bowed his head in respect. Slowly, he forced himself to turn around and walk away from the one person who had been there through his entire life. As he walked away, his mind drifted to the man named Strider who his father had told him to find and to the long journey ahead of him to find this man. His mind also wondered about Tauriel's fate and what she would do now she was not allowed to return to her home. Just before he reached his horse, he heard faint sobs and cry's coming from nearby. Drawing out his dagger he cautiously walked into a small open area and was paralyzed by what he saw. He saw a petit figure crouched over a body which he presumed to be lifeless on the floor. The woman had red hair cascading down her back and wore green tunics that reminded him of the woods at home. The woman's body was shaking, and she seemed to be racked by grief. To his shock, he realised it was Tauriel. He was shocked to find Tauriel like this as he had never seen any elf in such as state as this one. \"Tauriel,\" he called out with a worried expression on his face, his voice soft with compassion, \"What is wrong. Who is it that you lean over and weep for?\" Tauriel slowly looked up, her face littered with scratches and dirt, before moving out of the way. \"My Lord, this is who I grieve for.\" She moved out of the way and Legolas saw a pitiful sight on the floor. Kili was laying there, crimson blood in a puddle on the ground, his body bruised and battered. Legolas froze for a while, taking in the horrific sight before his eyes. He eventually looked up and in a soft and gentle voice said, \"I am sorry mellon, I know he meant a lot to you.\" With them words, Tauriel, who was now stood up, broke down into another series of sobs, her body shaking violently. Legolas didn't even hesitate. He strode over to her before wrapping her in his embrace. His arms holding her fragile body tightly to him while she fell apart in his arms. She rested her head on his chest as he gently rubbed her back. They stayed like that for several minutes with Legolas whispering reassuring words of comfort in her ear while she clung on to him and let the events of the past for hours sink in. Pulling away, Tauriel looked up at Legolas before whispering an almost inaudible,\" Thank you,\" her voice hoarse and quiet. \"Tauriel, I think we must return to the Woodland Realm,\" Legolas said firmly. Tauriel looked up in surprise as she knew that the he had refused to return so she looked at him with a questioning look on her face. \"I think I was wrong saying I did not want to return. Deep down I know that is where I belong and you too. My farther will forgive you for your betrayal to him and you shall no longer be banished.\" Tauriel bit her lip, she was not sure of this, but she also knew she had nowhere else to go and she wanted her home back and her kin, so she nodded her head in agreement. Placing his hand softly on her lower back, Legolas began to guide her back to his horse as he said, \"Let us go then Tauriel it shall be a few days ride.\" Before mounting the horse behind Tauriel, Legolas reconsidered his idea as he was unsure about how their return would be received but never the less, started the journey back home.[Chapter 2] Thanks for positive reviews and suggestions for ways to make my updates better. The words in italic are words in elvish. These are the words and their meanings. Ada= Father Mellon= Friend Mellon nîn= My Friend I have lots of ideas for future chapter which I have already planned. If you have an idea please pm me. I will try and update weekly or more. Hope you (Legolas and Tauriel's journey back to the Woodland realm is almost complete) Legolas slowed his horse down into a canter as he knew that they were nearly home. He was worried about their arrival as he did not know how the king would react. He knew Thranduil would be thrilled to have him home, but what of Tauriel? He knew Thranduil would not be at all pleased with her but would she still be cast out and banished? Legolas looked in front of him to see Tauriel peacefully sleeping, her body slouched against his back. Her long, auburn hair was blowing around in the biting wind. Her clothes had holes and rips in from the ferocious battle. Her face and body were covered in painful looking scratches, some of which were starting to heal. A small smile graced the princes face as he looked down on her. The prince turned back around to see that they had arrived at the Woodland realm. Legolas smiled, they were home. Legolas gracefully dismounted the tired black horse before turning to Tauriel. He placed his hand on her shoulder before gently shaking her, waking her up. \"We are here Tauriel, we are home,\" he said to her. He helped her dismount before a guard suddenly ran up to them. \"Welcome home my Prince and Captain,\" said a rather flustered guard. \"The king said that if either of you were to return you should go to his throne room at once.\" \"Why?\" said Tauriel, still half asleep. \"I was not told,\" the guard replied. He then left, leaving them to wonder what was going on. (Legolas and Tauriel have made their way to the throne room. They are stood outside as they stopped before entering.) \"Mellon nîn,\" the Captain quietly said, turning her body so she was facing the prince, \"What if your father will not let me stay?\" \"I will not allow him to do that Tauriel,\" Legolas said just as quietly. Without thinking, he reached out to place a hand on her lower back, stopping himself before touching her as he reminded himself she was still grieving over Kili's death. With that thought in mind, he turned his focus to the door in front of him before pushing them open and striding into the throne room. Thranduil looked up as he heard the doors open and small hint of a smile appeared on his face as he saw his son's presence. \"Legolas, you have returned,\" he said with a booming voice. \"Yes Ada.\" Legolas bowed his head in respect leaving Tauriel, who had been trailing behind him, on view for the King to see. Thranduil's face contorted into one of anger as he turned to Tauriel, his eyes ablaze with fury. \"Why is it you return? Did I not tell you that you to never set foot in my kingdom again yet again you have defied my orders? You led my people into war and death all because of a dwarf. You have no place here.\" Tauriel winced as his comments pierce through her, looking at the ground so he couldn't see the affect his words were having upon her. She knew returning with Legolas was a bad idea and felt humiliated. \"How dare you speak to her like that,\" a voice spoke. Tauriel glanced up to see that Legolas had moved and stood in front of her as if shielding her from his father's words. She could feel the anger radiating of him and saw his eyes narrowing at his father. \"You would do well to remember your place Legolas\" retorted the king. \"She is a lowly silvan elf and you would side with her against me?\" \"If this is my place then I do not want it.\" Legolas spoke, taking a step towards his father. \"She has as much right to stay here as me. Tauriel is right, there is no love in you. That dwarf that you talk of so dismissably is dead. He gave his life protecting Tauriel who is not even his kin. You think you are the only person who has ever lost someone you loved but you are not.\" Legolas' voice had been growing louder and louder, thoughts of his mother rushing through his head. He stopped and let out a sigh before turning around. His was met with the sight of Tauriel staring at the floor, her eyes glossy from the humiliation. \"If Tauriel goes, I go,\" Legolas said in a more controlled voice before taking a step back to stand next to her. Thranduil had stopped listening ever since he heard Legolas make a reference to his mother as he was lost in thoughts about his dead wife. He remembered the pain he went though, living every day of his life without her, raising Legolas on his own and having nobody he could talk to when he needed somebody. He glanced over at Tauriel and realised she had just lost someone whom she loved dearly. He then met his son's hardened and cold eyes before understanding that if he wanted his son to stay, he didn't have a choice in the decision. \"Fine, Tauriel you may stay,\" Thranduil said quite flatly. \"I presume you want to keep you position of Captain of the Guards?\" \"My Lord, it would be an honour,\" Tauriel said, her face lightening up. Legolas gave a small smile seeing the look on her face. \"Thank you, Ada, I missed you,\" he said. \"I missed you too my son,\" Thranduil said faintly, looking far into the distance. He then turned to Tauriel and with a stern expression said, \"Do not let me down again as I shall not be as forgiving, and my word shall be final.\" With that he motioned that they could leave. (Outside of the throne room) As soon as Legolas closed the doors he turned around to be met with Tauriel in front of him. She stepped forwards lightly hugging Legolas and said with a smile on her face, \"Thank you, I do not know what I would have done without you,\" before bowing her head in respect and walking away. Legolas, who was frozen from her actions, watched her leave feeling a sense of satisfaction knowing he was the reason for the change in her mood. \"It was no problem Tauriel,\" he whispered quietly to herself before also taking his leave.[Chapter 3] Legolas and Tauriel Chapter 3 Hello to anybody reading this. Once again thanks for positive comments and advice. I have in total 11 chapters planned for this story so far but I may write more chapters so keep checking to see if I updated. I will try post every weekend as my teachers are in love with the fact they can give out huge homework's during the week. If you have any ideas for a chapter, please pm me. Below are the elvish words used in the chapter and the translations. Finally I would just like to say R.I.P to Alan Rickman who died this week. I was a huge fan of his. Hope you enjoy the new update. Xxxxx Mellon nîn= My Friend Mellon= Friend (This scene takes place a few years after the battle of the five armies. During the years, Legolas and Tauriel have grown closer and she is starting to like him back. At the start of the chapter, the setting is Legolas's chambers.) Legolas woke up in his chambers to see that it was the middle of the morning. It was a sunny day and he could hear the birds chirping outside. After he finished getting changed the Prince strolled onto his balcony. His balcony overlooked a beautiful garden and to the side of that, the training field. The training field had many archery targets and a huge space for sword fighting. He was about to turn away when he saw a familiar looking, red headed elf practicing her sword motions. Legolas felt a smile appear on his face and after watching her for a few minutes, he decided to go and spent the day with her. He collected his weapons and made his way down to the training field. Tauriel had been up since the early hours, practicing her archery. The centre of the target was hit every time. She had now decided to move on to her sword skills as a sword was her weaker weapon. The Captain was practicing her motions when she felt and heard her sword clash with another. Tauriel quickly looked round to see the Prince standing before her. \"My Lord,\" she said politely and bowed her to show her respect and acknowledge his presence. \" Mellon nîn,\" Legolas said sounding slightly annoyed, \"Call me Legolas and nothing else.\" \"I shall, but what is it that brings you here,\" Tauriel said sounding slightly hopeful. \"I have come to challenge you to a duel,\" he replied grinning at her. She was not sure whether to accept this challenge or not as many in the kingdom had challenged the Prince in the past, none had managed to defeat him, however she wanted to spend time with him so Tauriel accepted the challenge. \"I shall accept and you shall not win,\" Tauriel said daringly. \"Is that right Mellon , you should remember that I am the Prince and nobody has ever beaten me before,\" Legolas said chuckling to himself. They drew their swords, both determined to win. The duel had begun. Legolas charged at Tauriel, his sword raised high. As he got near to Tauriel he brought his sword down but she easily dodged and she turned and faced him, bringing her sword out in front of her. They paced round each other for quite a while before attacking at the same time. Their swords clashed above their heads before Tauriel slyly kicked the back of his legs, causing him to fall over. He grabbed her as he fell onto his back, making her fall on top of the Prince. Tauriel was the first to recover and blushed a bit before remembering the duel and placed her sword on his neck. \"Do you give up Legolas?\" Tauriel asked him in a mocking voice. She laughed and looked up. She had beaten the prince, but then she felt herself being rolled over with a strong force. Tauriel looked up to see Prince on top of her with his sword at her throat. \"Do you give up Tauriel?\" Legolas said in a mocking voice. She tried to move but he had her firmly pinned down. \"Never get distracted and let your opponent attack when you are off guard,\" he said and chuckled. \"Do you give up?\" he asked one last time. \"Fine, yes,\" Tauriel unwillingly said but she knew that he had won. \"I still have the title of best fighter in the kingdom,\" he said smiling, then getting up he offered a hand to Tauriel who willingly took it. He pulled her up onto her feet with a bit too strong a pull. She fell into his arms and looked up at Legolas. They gazed at each other for a while and Legolas was about to say something when a breathless guard ran towards them. \"My Prince and Captain,\" he said taking breaths between every word, \"An army of orcs are marching towards the Woodland realm. It is not a huge army but they are approaching fast. Your father sent me. He has rallied up some troops but needs both of you there immediately, before it is too late. I hope this chapter was not too boring but I have never written a fight scene or battle scene before so that was a first attempt. If you have any advice for how I will write the battle in the next chapter please PM me. I will hopefully update again next week.[Chapter 4] Hi guys I hope you are well. Sorry for not updating for 2 whole weeks but I have had so much going on recently. I have had a few PM's requesting that I write certain scenes and I have them planned so keep sending ideas. RIP to Sir Terry Wogan who died recently of cancer. As usual, translations are below. Hope you enjoy. Xxxxx Ada= Father (Takes place straight after last scene where a guard has come and told Legolas and Tauriel that an army of orcs approaches the Woodland realm. Also I did not mention it in the last chapter but the guard brought a horse with him for them too ride to where the battle was.) (Hope that makes sense) \"Quick Tauriel you must ride with me,\" a panicked Legolas said swiftly mounting the chestnut coloured horse. He stretched out his hand and she took it. He pulled her up onto the horse before galloping away to battle. They arrived quickly and dismounted next to the king. They saw that the orcs were at least half an hour of reaching them. \"Ada, I thought the orcs had been destroyed during the Battle of the Five Armies many years ago?\" said a confused Legolas. \"No my son, these are the orcs who fled at the end of the battle, they have come back for revenge and I fear the rest are regrouping in a faraway land,\" Thranduil told the pair of elves, his eyes full hatred and anger as he mentioned the orcs. (Half an hour has past and the two armies are positioned, ready for battle.) An orc rides up and down the front of the army on his Warg yelling in black speech. The whole army of orcs then yell back and raise their weapons. Also Thranduil is riding up and down on his new Moose, shouting at the elvish army. \"Do not show them mercy, for you shall receive none. Slaughter them all in honour of the brave warriors who died years ago defending our people.\" After that, the battle had begun. (I read several PM and they said not to write about the actual battle, but what happens after the battle so I have followed their advice. Hope you are happy with that decision but I did not want to ruin the update by writing a really awful battle scene.) Several hours later the battle was finished. The army of orcs was not a big one but the orcs were skilled in fighting which was why it took the elves so long to destroy the orcs. Many elves were dead or wounded but most had survived. Legolas pulled his sword out of the dead orc and looked around to see his father in the distance, killing an orc. Legolas jogged over to him. When he got there Thranduil said to his son, \"How are..,\" he did not finish as Legolas interrupted. \" Ada,\" Legolas said starting to panic. \"Where is Tauriel?\" \"I am not sure. About an hour ago I saw her fighting over there. (He points to his left) Legolas you know she is an exceptional fighter. She will be fine,\" Thranduil said trying to reassure his son but Legolas was already gone. \"Tauriel, TAURIEL,\" the Prince shouted, hoping for a reply. Instead, when he looked to his right, he saw Tauriel fighting a group of orcs with her sword. He ran to help her but before he could get there an orc pushed her down onto the ground and stabbed her shoulder. Tauriel let out a scream of pain and she could feel blood oozing down her arm. She could see the orc lift his sword to make the fatal blow and she closed her eyes waiting for her death, but it never came. Tauriel opened her eyes to see the Prince running towards her shooting the group of orcs that had surrounded her. She let out a sigh of relief before realising how much pain she was in. She could feel tears rolling down her cheeks, unable to contain the pain. Legolas rushed over to her and on seeing her wound he let out a gasp of horror. \"Tauriel, listen to me, it will be ok.\" He could see that she was beginning to lose conciseness because of the blood loss. \"No Tauriel stay with me, please.\" \"Legolas,\" Tauriel whispered before going unconscious. As soon as she said that Legolas picked her up and ran back to his father, carrying Tauriel in his arms with tears streaming down his cheeks. Thranduil was talking to one of his more senior warriors when he heard Legolas behind him, panting and carrying something or someone. \"Legolas where were...,\" his voice trailed off when he saw Tauriel lying in his arms. Thranduil quickly ordered several healers to attend to Tauriel. Even though they often fought, he still thought of her as a daughter to him. After a few minutes he pulled aside one of the healers and said to her in an anxious voice, \"Is she likely to survive.\" The healer turned and faced the king and Legolas before saying, \"Honestly,\" she said, hesitating to tell them the truth. \"I am not sure that she will.\" Hoped you enjoyed it, will update again next weekend. xxx[Chapter 5] Hi to anybody reading this. Sorry it took me so long to update. I had several other things to do and as everybody here writes, I am sure you all understand that updating often can be quite hard. For this chapter I decided I would make the start go back to the end of the last bit chapter and retell it but from Tauriel's point of view. Hope that makes sense. Thanks for positive PM showing support and advice. Enjoy the update and will try and put the next chapter up next weekend. Translations are below. Xxxxx Tauriel POV I thrust my sword into the hideous orcs chest and drew it out as the orc fell to the ground. Looks like that training I did has come in useful. A group of about 5 orcs were approaching me and I got my weapons ready and ran forwards to attack them. I killed 1 of them and got ready for the next when I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. I had been stabbed. I collapsed to the ground, crying in pain. I saw an orc lift his sword and I closed my eyes preparing for the final blow, but it never came. I opened my eyes, not sure how I was still alive when I saw a familiar blond haired elf running towards me, shooting the group of orcs down as he ran. My mind then focused on the pain in my shoulder and I felt tears running down my cheeks. I felt like I might burst as I could no longer contain the pain. I could feel myself about to go unconscious when Legolas came and gasped, shocked at my wound. \"Tauriel,\" Legolas said I could feel I was about to go. \"No Tauriel, do not leave me, please,\" a crying Legolas said. \"Legolas,\" I managed to say, before everything went black. (Sorry for the time skip but we now go to 2 days after the battle. Tauriel is still unconscious. This is from nobody's point of view.) \" Ada , you requested to see me,\" Legolas said gloomily. The prince had just spent his time in his bedroom staring into space, worrying about Tauriel over the last few days. \"Yes, I have just had a report from the healers. Tauriel's condition is improving dramatically. Yesterday they did not think she would survive but now they say she should wake up anytime soon. You can go and see her if you wish,\" Thranduil said with a slight hint in his voice. Legolas's face light up hugely when his father said this and straight away rushed to go see her. When got there, a healer she showed him to the room where Tauriel was lay. He pulled up and chair, took her cold hand in his and sat there patiently. He glanced down at her and took in her beauty. Although scratched, her face was as gorgeous as ever, Legolas thought. (A few hours later) Legolas was still in the room where Tauriel lay. He looked out of the window for a while before he felt a slight movement in his hand. He quickly looked down to see Tauriel starting to stir. \"Legolas,\" she murmured. She could see piercing blue eyes looking softly down upon her. Tauriel tried to push herself up but because her shoulder was causing her so much pain she fell back down onto the bed. \"It's me Tauriel,\" Legolas said, overjoyed she was awake. When he saw her try to sit up and fail he reached over and gently helped her sit up. The Prince saw she was confused so he told her what happened after she blacked out. After Legolas had finished his story, Tauriel sat there thinking deeply about how much Legolas had done for her. \"I cannot thank you enough Legolas, without you I would be dead. I owe my life to you.\" \"If I had not of saved you my life would not be worth living for I would be filled with guilt and sadness,\" Legolas said looking away from Tauriel. \" Mellon, look at me.\" Legolas turned back to look at her. \"I thank you with all my heart.\" Just then a healer strolled in saying to Tauriel, \"I see you are awake my dear, if you want, you can go as I believe that you have strength now. Would you like that?\" The captain's face lit up as she hated being stuck indoors. \"Yes thank you.\" \"Ok but you will need to have someone help you around to start with as you don't have your full strength.\" \"That is ok I will help her,\" the Prince said smiling down at Tauriel. \"Right, that is sorted then. Prince Legolas would you mind stepping outside for a moment as I need to help Tauriel get changed?\" the healer said. \"Of course, call me when you are done,\" Legolas replied before walking out of the room. (A few minutes later) \"Legolas,\" the healer's voice shouted, \"You can come back in now.\" Legolas walked back in and put his arm around Tauriel's waist, supporting her as they walked out of the room. He took her to his bedchambers as it was nearly nightfall. \"Stay here tonight Tauriel. I will sleep better knowing that you are safe and I can protect you if anything happens,\" Legolas said. \"I shall Legolas as I will sleep better knowing that you are there to protect me,\" Tauriel said and with that she lied down on the bed and fell asleep with Legolas going to sleep next to her. I hope that this chapter is okay as when I wrote this I was starting to lose hope in this story for a bit. Thanks for reading. xxx[Chapter 6] Hi to whoever is reading this! I received a few PM's asking if I am near the end of the story and people asking for me to update more. I have around 6 more chapters planned but that is a guess and I come up with new ideas every so often but we are under halfway. Secondly I am a 12 year girl. I do other stuff apart from this (homework and hanging out with friends) so if I forget to update I am sorry but it is going to happen every so often. Also I must apologise as I did not give you the translations last time. Translations are below. Hope you enjoy. Xxxxxxxx Ada=father (We now go to just before Legolas is about to leave for the meeting of the fellowship of the ring. Not much has happened between the years but Legolas and Tauriel both have feelings for the other) \"Legolas, you must leave now,\" Thranduil said to Legolas with a sigh. \"I will not have you being late.\" \"Yes Ada but there is something that I must do first,\" Legolas said before walking out of the throne room. Legolas made his way to where the gardens were as he knew that he would find Tauriel there. They had grown close lately and both had feelings for the other. Legolas stopped before he entered the gardens as he could hear a faint humming. He looked ahead to see Tauriel sat on a bench humming to herself. Her red hair was being blown gently by the wind. She was wearing her usual hunting clothes and had her bow next to her. Taking a breath, Legolas entered the garden. As he looked around, he realised that he had never been inside this garden before. There were several different flowers, all were a bright colour. There was a little pond opposite the bench and he could see several different types of fish swimming around in there. He looked up and saw a massive tree looming above him. The tree had just reached its blossoming stage. He then heard a cough and saw that Tauriel was sat there staring at him. \"Hello Legolas, I would have thought you were had gone by now,\" Tauriel said with a frown upon her face. \"I was just leaving but I realised that there was something I had to do first, something important.\" \"Should you not being going and doing that deed then,\" Tauriel asked questioningly. \"I am about to do it,\" Legolas said looking confident but inside he was feeling butterflies. He had decided to tell Tauriel how he felt about her but didn't know if she felt the same way. \"Go on then,\" Tauriel said, a smile playing on her lips as she wondered and hoped about what the Prince might be about to do. \"Well I wanted to say that I …,\" \"There you are my Prince,\" a panting guard rushed in and said, \"Everybody is waiting for you so you can depart.\" \"I shall come but just give me a minute.\" \"Your father demands that you come now.\" \"Fine but just wait outside while I say bye to Tauriel and that's an order,\" Legolas commanded. (The guard leaves) \"Tauriel…..\" Legolas was cut of bye Tauriel placing her lips on his. The kiss was short and sweet but meant the world to both of them. \"Go,\" Tauriel said, \"We can figure out our feelings when you return but just know that I will be waiting for you.\" With that Tauriel grabbed her bow and walked out the garden. Legolas stood in a daze before the guard coughed snapping him out of it. He then followed suit and walked of unaware of the journey and sacrifices which lay ahead. If you read this then thanks for reading. I will try to update soon. Stay safe. Hope you enjoyed. xxxxxx[Chapter 7] Hi guys. I gave up on this story as I ran out of ideas but I looked on my computer the other day and saw that the story had around 700 views and I was really shocked by this. It has inspired me to start writing more chapters so expect some updates in the following week. If anyone has any ideas they think would do well in the story then just message me and I will try and fit them in. Thank you everyone for sticking with me even though I gave up I really appreciate it. xxx ","Summary":" (Takes place after The Hobbit Battle of the five armies.

Ballet has taken over much of my life and yet, a void that can never be filled is left in your place. I'm sure you'll think I'm being sentimental, but it happens when one has been away for so long. Some days I almost regret leaving you. My only consolation is your visit in the spring. I thank God each day that it is only twenty days away. As the day we will be together again draws near, I can't help but miss you even more. Love, Sara Derek sighed. To be perfectly honest, he missed Sara too. Though her message had seemed a little sappy, it was definitely Sara and that's what he loved about her. At the mention of his visit, a smile played across his lips. Derek had long awaited seeing Sara. It had been, what, four months since she started Julliard? His excuse to her was that he was waiting for her to get settled in. In reality, he was just trying to scrape up enough money. He was doing okay in his med school, the scholarship paid for 100% of his tuition and books, but he still had to work for his leisure money. That was why he had taken a part-time job as an apprentice to the local mechanic. It was manual labor, but it paid $20 an hour. So after these long months away at his school while Sara danced her heart out, he had managed to scrimp and save just enough for a round-trip ticket. He would, of course, stay in Sara's dorm with her. She had arranged it all with the dean, being organized as she was. Though his trip was less than three weeks away, he felt as though it would be an eternity before he would meet her again. ------- Sara ------- Back at Julliard, Sara was lounging in her dorm while her Spanish roommate Taeya is getting ready to go to a dance club. [S = Sara][T = Taeya] T: \"Ay! Chica, you shouldn't sit alone on a friday night. Come with me to ~~*Intersection*~~.\" She sat expectantly on the edge of Sara's bed. S: Sara sighed. \"I'm busy with... something.\" T: \"Oh really?\" She began doubtfully, \"Like what? Counting the threads in your sweater from the Gap? Puh-lease niña, come ON!\" S: With Taeya's urging starting to get to her, Sara's protest weakened. \"Well... I... I can't.\" T: \"Why not? Girl you know I know you ain't worried about your moves on the floor. I'm here for singing and I can still dance at ~~*Intersection*~~, so I know you got some ballet shit to show off.\" Sara bit her lip, she had purposely not attended any clubs or social gatherings since she arrived at Julliard. Temptation wasn't something she wanted to face. Not with Derek so far away. S: \"If I go with you tonight, will you leave me alone for a while?\" T: With her face lighting up brighter than the lightbulb above their heads, Taeya enthusiastically quipped \"Cross my heart!\" After some intense wardrobe adviseries, courtesy of Taeya, the girls were on their way to the club. ---------------- [@ Intersection] ---------------- Walking in the door, Taeya laughed and pointed to a hottie nearby. His bleach blonde spiked hair and icy blue eyes made him stand out against the crowd. T: \"He's the whole reason I come here.\" S: She shrugged \"Not bad.\" T: With a look of disbelief Taeya turned to Sara. \"Not bad? NOT BAD? The guy's a god!\" A short spunky girl with cropped hair dyed bright pink bounced up beside the two. Bangles jangled at her wrists and her black plastic framed cats-eye glasses glimmered under the flashing lights of the club. She laughed and said to Taeya \"He can be my god anyday.\" Sara looked from the petite miss to Taeya, slightly confused and majorly curious. Taeya smiled. \"Sara, this is Lala. Lala, Sara.\" The two shook hands and Lala rolled her eyes. L: \"My real name is Alana, Lala's just what friends call me.\" T: \"All the more reason for Sara to call you Lala. I know you guys will love each other.\" A knowing smirk settled upon her tanned face. She looked to the hot guy before returning her gaze to her friends and raising a finely plucked brow. \"Now, if you'll excuse me...\" Taeya bounded off towards 'her man.' L: Cocking her head, she mused aloud, \"You should meet Jordan too. He's really funny.\" S: \"Jordan? Oh! That one...\" Her eyes followed Taeya's coiled dark hair to her beau. L: \"Yeah! Let's go. Tae won't mind us butting in on her together time with him, she hoardes him to herself all the time anyway.\" Uncertain of what to say, Sara didn't even need to murmer a word. Lala grabbed her by the wrist and literally dragged her over to the couple. She smiled her flouncy smile and announced \"Jordan? This is Sara, Tae's friend.\" She would have expected him to smile and have his teeth that sort of off-white you'd expect from a prom king or something. Ah no, Jordan was much too 'punk' and 'fuck authority' for that. He nodded and shrugged. \"Hey.\" Looking down, Taeya felt the pockets of her denim mini, \"Damn.\" she cursed, \"I left my cell in the Jag and my sister's gonna call tonight with the results of her pregnancy test.\" Sara shook her head. \"Isn't your sister 15?\" Taeya's own head moved side to side. \"14.\" she replied with a melancholy attempt at a smile. Lala patted her shoulder, \"I'll go with ya.\" And so the two set off for the parking lot, leaving Jordan and Sara alone. She felt quite awkward, to be alone with someone she had just met. She made small talk, one of the few activities Jordan was willing to partake in. After a few moments, he began to loosen up and talk a little more. Sara had never told anyone the story of her mother's accident before, except Derek. And yet she found herself confiding in this complete stranger. There was something soothing and trustworthy about him. He repaid her life story with a short bio of his own. It had been about twenty minutes and Tae and Lala still hadn't returned. Apparently Jordan had grown bored of standing and talking, he looked to Sara. \"Wanna dance?\" She shrugged and so they were on the dance floor. It wasn't hard to grind with him, he used many of the same moves Sara herself had learned from Derek. Soon a crowd of people had formed around them, watching their bodies move in unison. The music ended and the crowd slowly went away. Sara, exhausted, sat in a chair to catch her breath. To her surprise, Jordan took a seat next to her and grinned. \"You're a great dancer.\" he practically had to shout over people's conversations and the latest song that had started. She returned his smile with one of her own. \"You're not so bad yourself.\" Jordan leaned closer to her. \"I'd really like to dance with you again.\" Sara's grin disappeared, could she be just friends with him? \"Uh... yeah. Yeah, sure.\" She felt his breath, hot on her own. His face hovered in front of hers for a moment before dipping down into a slow, tender kiss. It was then that Lala and Tae appeared beside them.[Chapter 2] ~~*Title*~~ : \"Different Steps\" ~~*Author*~~ : Atomic Kitten ~~*Email*~~ : ClosetMonster690@aol.com ~~*Website*~~ : http:// www . acidiclipgloss . strawberryshake . net [remove spaces] ~~*Summary*~~ : This Fan-Fic is PG-13/possibly R.

He wanted to tell her he loved her and he couldn't wait to see her, but he couldn't. Writing had never been his thing and now was definitely not a good time to send a mushy love note. Why? Well maybe it had something to do with his three roommates, all jocks, who were standing over his shoulder at the moment. \"Guys.\" He began exasperatedly, \"This is kind of private.\" One of his friends, Ty, started to make fake kissing noises. \"Oh Derek, kiss me!\" The other clones laughed, but walked away to leave Derek with his privacy. \"Thanks a ton.\" he murmured under his breath as he returned to contemplating his letter. A half hour later, he was still thinking. Ty walked in from the kitchen. \"Hey, we're going to the Omega party, it'll probably last all night, wanna come?\" Derek hesitated, as much as he would have liked to go, not only did he need to write Sara a reply, but he had a ton of studying to do too. \"Sorry, I can't.\" Ty nodded and turned to leave. Within ten minutes all of the guys were gone and Derek was finally by himself. He figured he would just write the letter later, so he finished all of his studying and still, no luck with words. Sighing, he settled onto the couch and flipped the TV on. After a few minutes, he closed his eyes and drifted into an uneasy slumber. *knock knock knock* \"What the Hell?\" Derek slowly sat up, he had been jerked from his sleep by some loud pounding. It took him a few seconds to realize that the pounding was someone at the door. Rubbing his eyes, he stood and stumbled to the front door. One of the guys had probably locked themselves out again. Then he remembered the conversation only, what, three hours ago. No way would they be home this early. Confused, he unlocked the door and opened it. His eyes widened in surprise at the girl standing in front of him. \"Nikki?\" ------- Sara ------- Taeya stood beside Sara and Jordan with Lala by her side. Tears streamed down her face in a steady flow and ruined her once flawless makeup. Sara's eyes widened and darted from her friend to Jordan. Had she seen? How could she not have? Lala patted Tae's back. \"It's ok, hun.\" Taeya shook her head, \"She threw her life away. She's only 14 and she's gonna have a baby.\" A sigh of relief escaped Sara. So this wasn't about the kiss. Although she still felt bad, considering what was happening with Tae's sister, it was a far cry from what she may have been saying, had she known what had just happened. \"Tae it's alright. She'll be fine.\" Sara tried her best to comfort Taeya. Again, her friend shook her head. \"I'm gonna leave Julliard. Go help her with her baby.\" The mouths of both Sara and Lala flailed open in unison. \"What? No! She wouldn't want you to give up your dream. At least one of you has to live that out!\" Lala exclaimed. Taeya shot her a dirty look, \"Thanks to her no-good 18 year old boyfriend, Faye won't GET to live out her dream. So shut the Hell up and don' t tell me what to do, I'm leaving tomorrow.\" Lala looked at Sara with desperation showing on her face, \"Stop her!\" Sara smiled weakly at Tae, \"Taeya, think about this. Make a decision after you've thought about it. There'll never be another chance for you at Julliard if you just drop out.\" With a look pure ice and a tone to match, Taeya replied \"I've decided. I don't want to come back. I'll be fine. I'm going to go pack now, if you'll excuse me.\" She pushed past Lala and ran out of the club. Lala sighed and sprinted after her. Sara started to follow, when someone grabbed her arm. Turning around she saw that it was Jordan. \"I need to go.\" she said. He nodded and kissed her again. \"I'll call you later.\" Heading out of the club, Sara had a lot to think about. Like what would she tell Derek? Would she tell Derek at all? What would happen to Tae? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *The Next Day* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A tear squeezed out of the corner of her eyelid as Sara helped Taeya load her stuff into her car. When everything was taken care of, and Taeya was finally ready to go, she turned to Sara. \"I'm gonna miss you so much, Chica!\" \"I'll miss you too, Taeya.\" The two hugged as Taeya promised to call Sara as soon as she got to wherever it was she was going and then to write soon after that. Sara watched the silver Jag jett down the street. Suddenly, she felt a hand on her shoulder. Nearly jumping out of her skin, she turned. Once again, it was Jordan. \"What are you stalking me?\" she asked dryly. \"Guess what?\" \"I hate guessing games.\" \"Geez grouchy, what's your problem.\" Sara's mouth opened in disbelief. How could he NOT know what her problem was? He must have realized his mistake, because he aplogized profusely and hugged her tight. \"Maybe you'll feel better when you hear my new.\" Sara waited patiently, not really dying to hear this oh-so-important news of his. \"I'm your new roomie.\" \"WHAT?!?\" came Sara's shocked reply. \"You... I... how?\" \"Well, I know the Dean personally... he's my dad's friend and since my dorm was overcrowded and yours is now vacant except for you, I got in\" She wasn't really sure how to feel. She KNEW she'd have to explain this one to Derek, he was going to be staying in her dorm, after all. But how?[Chapter 3] Title : \"Different Steps\" Author : Atomic Kitten Email : ClosetMonster690aol.com Website : http:www . acidiclipgloss . strawberryshake . net [remove spaces] Summary : This Fan-Fic is PG-13/possibly R.

Chapter Three : \"When Derek's away, will Sara play?\" ------- Derek ------- Nikki grinned coyly, \"That's right, Derek. Now that your burning piece of white trash is gone, we can go back to the way things were. They way things were meant to be. Me and you.\" Derek stood in the doorway, stammering some indistinguishable words about his opposition to the situation. Ignoring his protests, Nikki pushed past his muscular figure. \"Don't just stand there, baby.\" She cooed, luring Derek away from the door frame. Closing the door behind her, she locked it and spun around. Removing her tan trenchcoat, she hung it on the hook and turned to face Derek wearing nothing but a set of lilac lingerie. \"Shall we get started?\" ------- Sara ------- \"Uhh... that's great, Jordan.\" Sara replied, with all the enthusiasm she could muster. \"Isn't it? I'm not officially moving in until tomorrow, I just thought the news might cheer you up... with Taeya gone and all.\" Jordan flashed her a giant smile and continued, \"Well, I'm gonna go... I've got night practice for the play tonight.\" He took his hand off her shoulder and slinked away. Sara stood for a moment, unsure what to think. Shaking her head lightly, she turned on her heel and walked towards the front door of her dorm. Entering the cream colored living room, she shuddered. Her dorm seemed so empty without the bouncy Spanish girl to brighten it. And then it hit her. Soon, her dorm wouldn't be empty at all. Suddenly, she had many new questions to ponder. Like why had the officials of Julliard let Jordan into her dorm? It was true, his was overcrowded, but didn't they usually prohibit co-ed dorms? No... the dorm next to hers was co-ed. And he had said something about knowing the Dean personally. Sara supposed that would get him wherever he wanted in this school. Glumly, she sat down at her oak desk to write a letter to Derek. Her beloved Derek.[Chapter 4] Title : \"Different Steps\" Author : Acidic Kitten Email : ClosetMonster690aol.com Website : http: www . acidiclipgloss . strawberryshake . net [removenspaces] Summary : This Fan-Fic is PG-13/possibly R.

I hope you like it! Please comment, I love feedback. When I was younger, my best friend in the whole entire world was Thomas J. Yes, he was a boy. No, he was not my boyfriend. All the girls in school thought he was though, so they teased me mercilessly for it – well as mercilessly as you can get when you're eleven years old. I guess I can't blame them, it did seem that way. We never left each other's side. We rode bikes together, fished together, and one time I even convinced him to run away with me to Hollywood so I could live with the Brady Bunch. We even shared our first kiss together, but it was nothing. We were eleven and wanted to see what the big deal was about. Well, one day we were playing with our new makeshift squirt guns in the woods when we saw a beehive. Thomas J suggested we throw rocks at it to upset it, but I told him it was a bad idea. Well, he convinced me and we threw rocks at it. I realized I lost my ring – a mood ring I never took off – but the bees were coming after us, so we had to run for our lives. A few days later, Thomas J went to go looking for my ring without me knowing. Maybe to surprise me? I don't know, I never got the chance to ask him. Apparently, there were still bees in the beehive we knocked down, but he didn't know. The bees came after him, but he realized to late. He was allergic to bees. There were too many. I learned the news when my dad told me. I wouldn't come out of my room for days. My only friend in the entire world was gone – forever. On the day of the funeral, I worked up enough courage to see him one last time. But when I saw him, I couldn't take it. His glasses were missing and there were stings all over his face. I begged for him to get up and go climb a tree with me, as if it would help. I screamed for someone to help him and put his glasses back on – he couldn't see without his glasses. I ran to the house of the only person I could talk to, now that Thomas J was gone – my English teacher. For some reason I blurted out that I loved him, because at the time I had a huge crush on him. But then his girlfriend came out and it was just too much for me to bare. I ran to the weeping willow tree where Thomas J and I would always come to. It was where we could fish, where Thomas J said he was going to be an acrobat, and where we discovered why first kisses where such a big deal – especially when its with a person very special to you. So many memories were made by that tree with Thomas J. Now, they're just that – memories. There will never be any new ones to add to the collection. No new conversations, no new stories, no new fishing trips, no new adventures, no new climbs, no new nothing. I remembered something he said after we kissed. We were walking our bikes back home and we just swore not to tell anyone when he asked, \"Would you think of me?\" \"What?\" I asked. \"Well, if you don't marry Mr. Bixler.\" Thomas J explained. I smiled and said, \"I guess.\" As I rode away, I started to get butterflies in my stomach. What freaked me out was the fact that I got butterflies in my stomach was because of the thought that Thomas J might like me... and I might like him back. I shook off the feeling and rode my bike a little more. Right then on that tree branch, I wanted him to be with me more than ever. I wished with all my heart for him to come back, even if just for a minute so how I could tell him how much he truly meant to me. I wanted to let him know that no matter how many times I've ever said he was annoying, he was truly my best friend. A few weeks later I saw Thomas J's mom. She gave me my ring back. She said he was holding it when they found him. Its amazing that even while trying to save his own life, he was able to hold onto my ring. He was a true friend, the kind that you're only given once in a lifetime. I just hope that I was the same kind of friend to him. ","Summary":" Well, this is my first story for this account.

Blau. Blau wie der Himmel, unter dem man sich so unendlich klein und gleichzeitig so unendlich frei fühlte. So hatte sie immer von Blau gedacht. Schwarz war für sie immer die Farbe der Trauer und Hoffnungslosigkeit gewesen, die einen an den Tod erinnerte, der einem so heimtückisch nahm, was man liebte. Der einen in ein Nichts führte. Nun wusste sie es besser. Nach allem, was passiert war, hatten sich ihre Ansichten geändert. Blau und Schwarz hatten die Rollen getauscht. Blau war für Vada nur noch eine schreckliche Farbe, die Farbe, die der Stein an ihrem Stimmungsring hatte, nun, da Thomas J tot war. Als er noch lebte, da war der Stein schwarz gewesen. „Ich bin unglücklich, das bedeutet es, wenn der Ring schwarz ist!\", hatte Vada ihrem besten Freund trotzig erklärt. „Vielleicht bedeutet es ja auch, dass du glücklich bist.\", hatte er widersprochen, aber sie hatte ihn dafür nur geschubst. Er hatte Recht gehabt. Immer wieder dachte sie darüber nach, während sie zwischen den Ästen hockte, sie war schon immer gern auf Bäume geklettert und das hatte sich auch jetzt nicht geändert. Aber sie saß in letzter Zeit immer nur auf einem Baum: Auf ihrem Lieblingsbaum, auf Thomas Js Lieblingsbaum. Hier oben hatte er an einem Ast gehangen, kopfüber hatte er daran gehangen und ihr von seinen Traum erzählt, von seinem Wunsch, später Akrobat zu werden. Eigentlich hatte er es sich noch nicht einmal gewünscht, er hatte es gesagt, als wäre er fest entschlossen, als wäre das nicht nur ein wilder Traum, sondern seine wahre Zukunft, als wäre das schon in den Sternen geschrieben worden, als er noch nicht einmal lesen konnte. Der Baum erinnerte Vada immer an ihren Freund. Eine Zeit lang hatte sie ihn gemieden, aber eines Tages hatte sie Thomas J so vermisst, dass sie hier her gekommen war. Zu ihm. Es kam ihr so vor, als hinge seine Seele noch zwischen den Zweigen, an denen die Blätter langsam begannen, sich gelb zu färben. Der Herbst nahte. Wann würde der Ring sich färben? Auf Jahreszeiten hörte er nicht, zumindestens nicht auf die, die Gott vorgesehen hatte, vorausgesetzte, man glaubte an Gott. Der Ring lauschte auf die Jahreszeiten, die in ihrem Inneren herrschten, auf ihre Gefühle. Musik schienen sie zu sein und nach ihr schien der Stein zu tanzen. Im Dunkeln Vada eine Gestalt auf sich zukommen, etwas kurzatmig schon, da er den ganzen Weg schnell gegangen war, so schnell es eben ging. „Vada!\", rief ihr Dad. „Vada! Komm herein!\" Er blieb stehen und sah seine Tochter, die im Herzen des Baumes saß, dort, wo alle Äste herauszuwachsen schienen. Als sie nicht reagierte, ging er weiter auf sie zu. Am Fuße des Baumes blieb er stehen. „Es gibt Essen! Bitte, komm!\", flüsterte er zärtlich, wie es ein Dad eben tat. „Ich habe keinen Hunger!\" Abweisend sah sie ihm entgegen, er konnte die Entschlossenheit geradezu sehen auf ihrem Gesicht, die Entschlossenheit, nicht mitzukommen, nichts zu essen. „Es wird kalt.\" „Ist mir egal!\" „Komm!\", brüllte er, Vadas Vater war einfach kein geduldiger Mensch. „Nein!\", schrie seine Tochter zurück, widerspenstig. Er sah sie an und sie senkte den Blick. Er hatte gewonnen. Langsam ließ sie sich aus dem Herzen, dem Schoß, herunterrutschen und landete, geschickt wie eine Katze, vor seinen Füßen. Schweigend gingen Vater und Tochter zu ihrem Haus zurück, dessen Fenster in der Dämmerung anfingen, wie Glühwürmchen zu leuchten. Der Baum stand einsam in der Dunkelheit. Thomas J ist einsam, dachte Vada traurig. Warum ließ er sie nicht einfach bei ihm? Weil er tot, war. Tot. Tot. Warum ausgerechnet er? Hätten sie nicht irgendeinen anderen nehmen können? Wer immer dieses sie auch sein mochten? Irgendeinen anderen, nur nicht ihren besten Freund. Vada wollte gerade die Tür öffnen, als ihr Dad sie zurückhielt. „Vada!\", sagte er leise und sanft. „Sieh mich an! Bitte!\" Widerwillig drehte sie sich zu ihm um, die Hand, die schon in der Luft gewesen war, die die Klinke hatte drücken wollen, ließ sie sinken. „Schau, Vada! Thomas J ist tot, verstehst du?\" Die Erkenntnis, wie dumm diese Aussage doch war, ließ ihn schnell etwas Neues sagen. „Was ich damit sagen will\", machte er unbeholfen weiter, „ist, dass du... Du kannst nicht die ganze Zeit auf diesem Baum sitzen und die Tage damit verbringen, an ihn zu denken. Er wird davon nicht wieder lebendig. Du vergeudest dein Leben, Vada! Es bringt nichts. Er ist nicht mehr da. Weg! Warum verstehst du das denn nicht?\" „Als Mommy starb, was hast du da gemacht, Dad?\", fragte Vada und ihre Stimme klang fest. Und anklagend. „Was hast du da gemacht?\" Unbehaglich zuckte ihr Vater die Achseln. „Nun ja, weiß du, ich hab...\" Sie ließ ihren Vater nicht ausreden, fiel ihm einfach ins Wort, sie wären alle nur Lügen gewesen. Aber ihre Stimme, die eben noch so stark war, bebte nun. „Du hast dich verkrochen. Bei den Toten. Ich hatte solche Angst vor ihnen. Du hast dich zwischen toten Leuten versteckt!\" Darauf antwortete ihr Dad nicht mehr, Er ging einfach an seiner Tochter vorbei, ohne sie noch einmal anzusehen. Er wollte die Wahrheit nicht hören. Und sie auch nicht. Vada folgte ihm ins Haus, obwohl sie keinen Hunger hatte. Sally saß schon in der Küche. „Wo seid ihr denn so lange gewesen?\", fragte sie und ließ ihren Blick zwischen ihrem Mann und Vada hin- und herschweifen, als suchte sie in ihren Mienen nach der Antwort. „Oh, Vada und ich hatten noch etwas zu besprechen!\", erklärte er seiner Frau so unbefangen wie möglich. Sie hörte, dass es nicht die ganze Wahrheit war, aber die wollte sie nicht hören. Sie fragte nicht nach. Was wir Menschen doch für Feiglinge sind, dachte ihre Stieftochter. Wir alle! Oft hatte Vada sich ausgemalt, wie es wäre, Thomas J zu folgen. In den vielen Stunden, die sie auf dem Baum saß, konnte man schon auf solche Gedanken kommen. Sie hatte es sich ausgemalt, bis in das letzte Detail. Wie sie im Badeanzug und dünn wie sie war, zwischen den Häusern verdeckt bleiben würde, wie die Schatten der Nacht sie verschwinden ließen, wie einen guten Freund, der für ein paar Tage Unterschlupf brauchte. Sie, Vada, würde nur ein paar Minuten brauchen. Sie hatte sich selbst in Gedanken gesehen, wie sie den Steg entlangging, sich an seinem Ende hinsetzten würde, die Beine im Wasser baumelnd. Sie würde sich abstoßen von dem Holz, das wie ein rettendes Floß im Meer wirkte. Aber sie stieß sich davon ab, ruderte mit ihren Armen so weit sie konnte auf den See heraus. Und irgendwann, wenn sie keine Kraft mehr hätte, dann, ja dann würde sie ertrinken. Und Thomas J würde sie abholen. Bestimmt! Er war doch ihr Freund, ihr bester! An diesem Abend konnte Vada nicht schlafen. Ihr ging so viel durch den Kopf, dass dieser einfach nicht zur Ruhe kam. Sie dachte so viel über Thomas J nach und über das Gespräch mit ihrem Vater und darüber, wie oft man die Wahrheit ignorierte, selbst wenn sie vor einem stand und ein Schild hochhielt, keiner wollte sie sehen. Und da beschloss sie, es zu tun. Folgen, ihm folgen... Sie schwang ihre Beine aus dem Bett. Sie setzte sich an ihren Schreibtisch, nahm ein weißes, unbeschriebenes Papier und den Bleistift, den ihr Dad ihr erst vor kurzem geschenkt hatte. Ich bin schwimmen gegangen schrieb sie, und keine Zeile mehr. Nur diesen einen Satz. Würden sie sofort begreifen? Sie nahm den Zettel in die eine Hand und kramte dann in ihrem Schrank nach ihrem Badeanzug. Sie musste nicht lange suchen. Blau war er, mit kleinen bunten Fischen darauf. Dann schlich Vada leise über den Flur. Alle paar Schritte hielt sie inne, horchte auf das noch so kleinste Geräusch, aber alles blieb still. Sie schlich zu dem Zimmer ihrer Großmutter. Es war stockfinster darin, so dass man die Hand nicht mehr vor Augen sehen konnte. Tastend, suchend, ging Vada zu dem Bett. Sie fühlte die warme Hand und nahm sie fest in die ihre. „Granny!\", wisperte sie in den Raum hinein, nur um noch ein letztes Mal den Klang der Wörter auf ihrer Zunge zu schmecken. „Granny...\" Erst dann verließ sie das Haus. Den Zettel legte sie auf den Küchentisch, aber erst draußen, von der Nacht verborgen, zog sie sich um. Im Haus hatte sie Angst, irgendjemanden aufzuwecken, ihren Dad oder Sally. Sie würden nur versuchen, es ihr auszureden, selbst, wenn es zwecklos war. Der Gedanke war tief in ihrer Seele drin, sie konnten ihn nicht bloß mit Sätzen und Silben herausholen. Ihr Blick glitt umher. Die Häuser, meistens sehr ordentlich, fast ein bisschen spießig. An ihrem eigenen Wohnort blieb er hängen. Nie wieder Dad sehen, nie wieder Sally. Die Beiden wollten noch ein Baby bekommen. Sie selber würde es nicht mehr miterleben. Ein kleines Brüderchen oder Schwesterchen, mit Fingern, kaum so groß wie ihr Daumennagel... Nein, dachte sie energisch. Nie wieder! Und das ist auch gut so! Abrupt rannte sie los, rannte aus dem Garten, über die Wiese. Es nieselte leicht. Der Himmel war mit grauen, dicken, schweren Wolken bedeckt. Vada rannte auf den Steg zu. Als ich das letzte Mal so darauf zugelaufen bin, da waren die Bienen hinter uns her, fiel es ihr ein. Die Bienen, die Thomas J totgestochen hatten. Vada rannte davon, vor den Bienen, die aus ihren Gedanken entschlüpft waren, als wäre ein Loch darin. Sie rannte über den Steg und sprang in das Wasser. Es war eiskalt und sie erschauderte. Aber sie achtete nicht darauf, auf die Kälte, die durch ihren Körper zog, sondern sie schwamm. Mit klammen Armen, mit schweren Beinen schwamm sie auf die Mitte des Sees zu, bloß weit weg vom Ufer. Es brauchte lange, bis man so müde war, dass man nicht mehr konnte, sich auch nicht mehr mit letzter Kraft ans Ufer retten konnte. Aber Vada hielt durch. Sie wollte durchhalten, biss die Zähne zusammen und kämpfte weiter. Und irgendwann war die Müdigkeit da. Sie sang ihr ein Schlaflied in dem verlassenen Gewässer und lockte sie in die Müdigkeit des Todes. Vada konnte nicht mehr. Und dann begann sie, unterzugehen. Sie fiel, glitt hinab in die unendliche Tiefe, die Augen schon fast geschlossen, so müde war sie. Du lebst, sagte auf einmal etwas in ihr. Klar und deutlich. Du lebst! Du musst weiterleben! Weiterleben! Weiterleben! Sie hatte Angst. Sie hatte solche Angst. Sie fühlte, wie sie keine Luft mehr bekam. Und dann schrie sie. Sie schrie in Todesangst. „Vada! Vada! Es ist alles okay! Wach auf!\", hörte sie eine Stimme neben sich und als sie die Augen aufschlug, war das Wasser verschwunden und an seine Stelle war wieder ihr Zimmer getreten. Neben ihr stand Sally in einem weißen Nachthemd, mit winzigen Blüten. Schon wieder der Traum! Schon wieder! „Ist alles in Ordnung? Oh Vada, du bist ja so blass!\", flüsterte Sally besorgt und drückte ihre Stieftochter fest an sich. „Oh Sally!\" Plötzlich war wieder Leben in Vada gekommen, sie schluchzte auf und dann heulte sie. Sie heulte laut wie ein kleines Kind. „Oh Sally!\", weinte sie immer wieder. „Oh Sally! Thomas J soll wiederkommen! Er darf nicht tot sein!\" Und das einzige, was diese tun konnte, war Vada fest an sich zu pressen, ihr ein Gefühl von Geborgenheit zu geben. Da hörten sie Schritte. Vadas Tür ging auf und Granny kam in das Zimmer ihrer Enkelin geschlurft. Gedankenverloren sah sie aus, wie immer. Sie ging zu Vadas Bett hinüber und setzte sich an den Rand, ohne Sally zu beachten, ja, sie sah sie nicht einmal. Langsam legte sie ihre Hand auf Vadas. Und dann begann sie ein Lied zu singen, ein schönes, altes, eins von früher, als sie eine der besten Sängerinnen gewesen war, die man im Staat kannte. Ihre Stimme war freilich nicht mehr ganz so schön wie damals, aber ihre Enkelin lauschte ihr andächtig. Sally zog sich zurück und ließ die Beiden alleine. Und noch bevor das Lied zu Ende war, fiel Vada wieder in den Schlaf. Aber dieses Mal war es ein tiefer, traumloser Schlaf, durchwachsen von den Liedern ihrer Großmutter.

Vada enjoyed spending time with Judy but she really missed Thomas J. Thomas J had meant a lot to her and she always thought about him when she could. Also Vada had put on lots of weight and was now obese. It was half past nine at night and Vada was getting ready for bed. She had a photo frame with a picture of her and Thomas J in it next to her bed. She often thought of him and he was the only boy who truly had her heart despite being dead. Every night before bed she would kiss it and whisper \"I love you Thomas J\". She was just about to put her nighty on when she looked in the mirror and saw how fat she was. She then sighed to herself and said \"Thomas J will never love me like this\". Vada was really fat. Her belly spilled over her knickers which were white with red roses on and her breasts were slightly bigger than before due to the fact they were mostly fat. Vada then put on her nighty and kissed the photo frame of her and Thomas J before going to sleep at quarter to ten. It was midnight and Vada heard a really familiar voice calling her name quietly. Vada woke up….\" who's there?\" Vada whispered looking around. She couldn't see anybody but she kept hearing her name being called out by a very familiar voice. The voice sounded like Thomas J. \"I must be dreaming\" Vada said to herself. Vada then got out of bed and found a flashlight in her room. \"Show yourself\" Vada quietly called out waving the flashlight about. \"Point the flashlight at the end of the bed\" the voice instructed. So Vada did and sitting on the end of the bed was Thomas J. Vada could not believe what she saw. Vada rubbed her eyes and he was still there. \"Thomas... J…\" Vada stammered. \"I thought you were dead\" \" I am \"Thomas J responded. \"I have come to see you because I miss you in heaven\". \"Plus you were the only girl for me. \"I wish I could stay with you in heaven\" Vada said. \"But then I would have to die. \"I could take you to visit one night in your dream\" Thomas J told Vada. The fat 12-year-old girls lit up. \"I would love that!\" Vada quietly exclaimed. But then Vada then felt sad. \"Thomas J I really don't think you would want to be with me because you can do a lot better than me\" Vada sadly said. \"What makes you think that?\" Thomas J questioned. Vada sighed. \"If I show you…please don't get grossed out okay?\" Vada then instructed Thomas J. Thomas J shrugged Vada then sighed and took off her nighty. Vada stood in front of Thomas J in her bra and panties. \"I comfort ate after you died and became fat\" Vada sadly told Thomas J. \"I don't think your gross\" Thomas J told Vada. Vada's eyes lit up. He still found her beautiful despite being obese. \"I love you Thomas J\" Vada said to Thomas J while blushing. \"I love you too\" Thomas J told Vada. \"You should try the milk and cookies in Heaven\" Thomas J said to Vada and just then there was a loud rumbling noise and Thomas J looked out of Vada's bedroom window. \"What you looking for?\" Vada asked. \"Lightning\" Thomas J responded…\" I'm sure I heard thunder\". Just then there was another loud rumbling sound. \"There it is again!\" Thomas J exclaimed Vada blushed \"That was my tummy rumbling\" Vada nervously chuckled. \"That mention of milk and cookies made me hungry\". Thomas J's eyes were now focused on Vada's huge belly. It let out another loud rumble. \"If I go get milk and cookies from downstairs will you still be here?\" Vada asked Thomas J. \"Sure I'm not due back in Heaven until dawn\". Thomas J responded. So Vada put on her pink robe and went downstairs to the kitchen and returned with a bottle of milk and the cookie tin. Vada took off her robe and sat in her bra and panties eating cookies and drinking milk. Once Vada had eaten all the cookies and drank all the milk she became sleepy again. \"It was great seeing you again\" Vada told Thomas J. \"Please come visit me tomorrow\" She then said to Thomas J. \"Sure thing Vada\" Thomas J said while smiling. In fact, I may take you to Heaven for the night\" \"That would be great\" Vada exclaimed. Vada than sat back on the bed. \"Before you go I just want to say that I still love you\" Vada told Thomas J. \"I love you too\" Thomas J told Vada and before long Vada kissed Thomas J on the lips before he disappeared back to Heaven and Vada then went back to sleep.

She thought to herself about all sorts ofrnthings when she was alone. However this time she thought about nick and Thomas J. IfrnThomas J. were still alive I wonder what he would think about me kissing nick. Or evenrnknowing him for that matter she thought as she looked up at her popcorn ceiling. Shernhad always hated her popcorn ceiling. The popcorn made it extremely hard for her tornstick glow in the dark stars on the ceiling. Her thoughts were mixed on the popcornrnissue and the nick and Thomas J. issue. She usually didn't like to think about Thomas J.rnIt was the one thing that made her feel sad. She felt that his death was her fault andrncouldn't let it go. She remembered when Nick had purposely fooled her into thinkingrnthat he dropped her mood ring into the tar. She had been so mad at him. But she reallyrndidn't know why. Why did I freak out?? she thought I mean. I know he was my bestrnfriend but losing a mood ring shouldn't have made me freak out. As she thought aboutrnthis, she could here a distant replay of Thomas J's last words to her \"...would you thinkrnof me...\" his voice sounded faintly in her head \"...well, if you don't get to marry yourrnteacher...\" She had answered yes but would she really have married Thomas J.?rnEspecially with nick around now. Things were so confusing. She lost herself in thoughtrnuntil the doorbell snapped her back into reality. She flew down the stairs expecting itrnto be the workers bringing in another dead corpse. I hope it's not two days old againrnshe thought as she reached for the doorknob. She opened the door. Without looking uprnto see who it was she plainly asked, \"is it two days old again?\" \"What are you talking about,\" said a confused but familiar voice. Vada looked up to see not a worker, but nick standing in front of her. \"Nick?\" she asked blushing, she had forgotten that he was coming to visit for 5 days. \"Irnam so sorry, I thought you were...oh never mind, come in.\" Nick stepped in as Shelly and Vada's father came up behind her. \"Hey, nick how's your mom and bill doing?\" asked Vada's father, \"I heard the wedding'srncoming up pretty soon.\" \"Yeah, everything's completely hectic, that's why they sent me here, but I don't mindrnsince Vada's also here,\" Nick replied. \"Vada will show you where you'll be staying, just try not to wake the baby ok?\" saidrnShelly putting a finger to her lips when she mentioned the baby. \"Okay Mrs. Sultenfuss,\" said Nick as Vada grabbed his bag and started up the stairs. When they were in the quest room, neither of them knew what to say. Breaking thernawkward silence Nick finally said, \"you know, you didn't have to bring my bag up.\" \"It was the least I could do after you helped me so much last summer, and besides, howrnelse am I going to pay you back for the nice earrings you sent me?\" said Vada. \"Oh, you got them, do you like them?\" Nick asked. Vada curled her hair around one her to reveal the earring placed neatly in her ear,rn\"yup,\" she replied. \"They look really good on you,\" said Nick, \" oh but one is coming out.\" he got up andrntightened the backing on her earring. Realizing what he was doing he quickly backedrnaway. But Vada had liked the feeling, \"I don't think its tight enough,\" she said sitting on therncouch and trying purposely to not get her earring. Nick walked over and tightened itrnmore. They looked at each other. Nick took out something from his pocket. \"It's wishing dust,\" he said as he sprinkled on top of them both. As the sparkles fell,rnNick brushed his fingers against Vada's cheek and they leaned closer to each other.rnTheir lips met in a soft kiss. I wonder what it would be like if thomas j were here rightrnnow thought Vada, remembering her earlier thoughts. All of a sudden a familiar voicerncleared his throat. Automatically thinking it was her dad or Shelly, she said, \"it notrnwhat you…\" but she didn't finish because it wasn't her dad or Shelly clearing theirrnthroats, it was THOMAS J.!!!!!!!!!! \"Thomas J?\" Vada cried in disbelief, \"but…how canrnyou…you were dead I saw you!\" she sputtered. \"you wished me here,\" said Thomas J. \"the wishing dust remember? And who is thisrnyour kissing?\" he looked at Nick with a rather jealous and angry face. \"oh right, umm Thomas J, this is Nick and Nick, remember when I told you about myrnfriend?\" \"y..e..a..h??\" said Nick, freaked out. \"well this is him,\" said Vada. \"are you kidding?\" said Nick. \"She's not kidding, trust me,\" said Thomas J. \"oww!\" he cried suddenly, putting his handrnto his face. Vada gasped as he took his hand away, the scars from the bee stings were still there.rn\"oh Thomas J. the bee stings. It's my fault you died, if I hadn't lost my mood ring thisrnnever would have happened.\" \"no its not Vada, I did it for you, you're my best friend and you always will be,\" saidrnThomas J. \"hey I just thought of something, if Thomas J is supposed to be dead, what are werngoing to tell Shelly and Vada's dad,\" said Nick. \"we won't have to worry, except for you two, no one else can see me or hear me,\" saidrnThomas J \"though I wish I didn't have to see or hear you Nick, I saw what you and Vadarndid last summer.\" \"why are you getting so emotional?\" asked Vada. \"uhh, no reason,\" Thomas J. said quickly. Nick saw right through him, he knew he wouldrntalk with Thomas J later. \"well, whatever, I've got to go now, the funeral's about to start and I have to makernsure everything goes okay.\" Vada said as she hopped off of the guest bed and walkedrnout of the room. Nick and Thomas J were left alone. Again an awkward silence filled the room. Nickrnbroke it again by saying, \"you like her don't you.\" \"what are you talking about?\" said Thomas J, confused. \"Vada,\" Nick said, \"you like her don't you.\" \"of course I do, she's my best friend,\" said Thomas J, pretending to be dumb. \"no, no, no!\" said Nick, \"I mean you like her!\" \"why would you even think that,\" said Thomas J nervously. \"oh please you were so jealous when you saw us together,\" said Nick knowingly, \"trustrnme, I know a lot about jealousy.\" he said, remembering when Bill had gotten jealousrnwhen that cardiologist made a move on his mom. \"I…uh…don't know what y-your t-talking about,\" said Thomas J nervously. Nick cocked arnbrow and Thomas J knew his gig was up, \"ok, ok. I like her. But I hate it. She is --or wasrnanyway-- my best friend and I'm not supposed to feel that way about her.\" \"you can't help it when you've been bitten by the love bug,\" said Nick. \"yeah I guess, but it doesn't matter. I can't do anything about it now. I'm dead,\" hernsaid wiping something from his eye, \"I mean, I always wanted to tell Vada I liked her,rnbut before I had the chance, I died.\" \"how long are you going to be here?\" asked Nick. \"wish conjures only last for 5 days why?\" asked Thomas J in reply. \"I'm going to help you tell her that you liked her before you go back to heaven,\" saidrnNick. \"really?\" said Thomas J. excitedly, \"you're willing to sacrifice your vacation for me.\"rnNick nodded, \"Now I know why Vada likes you so much Nick, you're really nice.\" \"well, it's a once in a life…I mean dead time thing,\" said Nick jokingly, \"come on, let's gorndown stairs, I've always wanted to see a funeral.\" They walked out of the room and downstairs. After the funeral, Judy had come over and asked Vada to go with her to her house forrna second. When Vada left, Nick and Thomas J started thinking of a good way forrnThomas J. to tell Vada that he liked her. Their first plan was to go to their favouriternplace, the old tree. They figured it would be a great spot for Thomas J to get arnromance vibe out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THE NEXT DAY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Thomas J and Vada sat by the tree. They remembered all the fun times they had atrnthis spot. Nick, who was watching from a distance, saw them telling each otherrn\"remember that time…\" things. He saw them look in each other eyes. He began to feelrnweird. A sort of angry feeling, but he couldn't put his finger on it. He began to getrncloser to them. When they were in his earshot, he stopped and ducked behind a bench.rnHe listened carefully, the conversation was still mainly about remembering old times.rnSuddenly, there was silence. Slowly, Nick looked up from his hiding place. He sawrnThomas J and Vada leaning into each other. The wave of the unknown feeling washedrnover him again. He quickly got up and cut right in between them. \"uh…we better go it'srngetting late,\" he said quickly, pulling Vada up and pushing her away. He grabbed ThomasrnJ too and pulled him. Why did I do that? Nick thought and he pushed Vada and pulledrnThomas J. why did I freak out? he didn't know why he had done it, all he knew was thatrnday 1 was over. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Day two~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The plan for today was that they would go to the place where Thomas J died. It wouldrnbe a good sentimental place for Thomas J to reveal his feelings. It started off thernsame as yesterday, Thomas J and Vada talking about way back when and Nick watchingrnfrom not too far behind. Thomas J was asking Vada if she remembered when they werernlittle and thought about going to live with the brady bunch. But Vada wasn't reallyrnlistening. She was thinking about the yesterday. Why did Nick do that? she thoughtrnWait a minute, what was I about to do! I almost kissed Thomas J! What was I thinking!rnI almost wanted to!!! It's a good thing Nick was there to stop me. \"...Vada?\" Thomas J said, \"earth to Vada.\" \"Huh? what?\" said Vada, snapping back to reality. \"I asked you if you remembered when we were going to live with the Brady Bunch?\" saidrnThomas J. \"oh sorry, yeah I do,\" replied Vada. \"Remember when we...uh...you know...kissed,\" Thomas J said blushing. \"Yeah,\" said Vada, \"we wanted to see what the big deal was.\" He stared at her and she stared back. Both of them didn't know what to do. Thomas Jrnleaned closer to her. She found herself leaning closer to him. Their eyes closed andrnthey both braced for impact. But before they could kiss, Nick stepped in between them. \"Uh,\" he stammered, trying to think of something to say, \"l-look atrnthat...that...that...that bird over there,\" he pointed, looking relieved. They both turned and saw the bird. It was a plain and ordinary bird with brown speckledrnwings and a light grey head. They looked at him with cocked brows. He blushed and theyrngot up to go home. Why did Nick do that? Vada thought as the three of them walkedrnhome Why does he keep doing that? She didn't know why he had done it. All she knewrnwas that Day 2 was over. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Day Three~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ By now Thomas J was getting frustrated. Three days had gone by and he still hadn'trntold Vada how he felt. So much for Nick helping me thought Thomas J Everytime I tryrnto tell Vada I like her, Nick gets in the way. Why is he so determined to ruin myrnchances?? Thomas J thought as he walked with Vada to their third destination, ThomasrnJ's house. They climbed onto the abandoned balcony. His parents had long since movedrnout. After their son died, they felt that the house had too many memories. Vada andrnThomas J sat on the rail. Nick waited behind the house. This time it was Vada's turn tornremember something. She started to tell Thomas J about a time when they had beenrnthere. Like Vada yesterday, Thomas J wasn't listening. He kept thinking about why Nickrnwas getting so emotional everytime he tried to tell Vada how he felt. He decided thatrntoday was the day. He wasn't going to give Nick the chance to get in the way. Herngrabbed Vada by the shoulders and pulled her close to him. He got ready for the kiss hernhad been waiting for when Nick shouted. \"Vada it's your dad!\" Vada pulled away from Thomas J and looked out into the street. Sure enough, her dadrnwas walking towards Thomas J's tombstone which his parents requested be located byrntheir house. Thomas J, Vada, and Nick scrambled to get out of there before they wererndiscovered. They ran back to the house Why did Nick interfere again?? ThoughtrnThomas J as they ran Why does he keep interfering? He didn't know why Nick hadrndone it. All he knew was that Day three was over. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Day Four~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This is the last straw thought Thomas J. I leave tomorrow. There is no way Nick willrnstop me today. That's it thought Nick if he tries to kiss Vada again today, I'm going to bust! Why are Nick and Thomas J looking at each other like that? thought Vada I thoughtrnthey would be best friends by now. They all thought to themselves as they walked to the pond. Silence filled the air thernwhole way. When they were finally at the pond Thomas J did something drastic. Herngrabbed Vada again and pulled her close again. Nick tried to interfere but before herncould do anything, Thomas J grabbed him and pushed right into the water. Vada gaspedrnand ran over to the edge of the pond. She held out her hand to help Nick. When ThomasrnJ saw what he had done, he rushed over to help too. When they had gotten Nick out ofrnthe water Vada stared at them both. Then she ran home. She knew why they had donernit, Thomas J knew why they had done it, and Nick knew why they had done it. Theyrnknew that Day Four was over. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Day Five~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Neither Nick, nor Thomas J, nor Vada had spoken to each other all day. They prettyrnmuch kept to themselves. Until Vada confronted both of them. \"Ok, what's going on?\" she asked, staring at the both of them. They looked at each other and knew it was confession time. \"Well Vada, I've been meaning to tell you this, I love you, I've always loved you,\" saidrnThomas J. \"I love you too,\" said Nick, \"I was jealous and worried that you liked him better thanrnme.\" \"Wow,\" said Vada, \"I love you both, but I know I could never choose between you two.\" \"I know you can't Vada, so, you and Nick should be together,\" said Thomas J. \"what?\" said Nick and Vada in unison. \"I see now why Vada likes you Nick. You like her very much,\" said Thomas J, \"andrnbesides, I'm dead, so it's not fair if Vada doesn't get either of us. Vada deserves betterrnthan me anyway. The only person I can think of whose better for her is you.\" Thomas J took both of their hands and placed them together. Vada and Nick looked atrneach other. \"I just hope I'm worth more than ten dollars this time,\" said Vada jokingly. Nick laughed and leaned closer to her. She leaned in closer to him. They kissed. ThomasrnJ smiled, glad to see his best friend so happy. They pulled away from each other andrnsaw Thomas J begin to fade. \"Thomas J you're fading!\" said Vada. \"I'm going back to heaven,\" said Thomas J. Nick put his arm around Vada's shoulders and they both watched as Thomas J fadedrnuntil he was gone. \"Goodbye Thomas J,\" Vada whispered. Then from out of nowhere, Thomas J's glassesrnappeared. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BLANG BLANG BLANG BLANG! The alarm woke Vada up with a start. Had it all been a dream? she wondered. Shernlooked at her bedside table. Sitting on it, were Thomas J's glasses. She looked up at herrnpopcorn ceiling and smiled. For a split second, she saw Thomas J's face. He winked andrndisappeared. Leaving a smiling Vada and a sleeping Nick behind. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THE END~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ","Summary":" Torn Vada walked into her room and sat down.

She couldn't help but smile a little at the young woman in a flowing white gown gazing back at her. \"Oh Vada, no one has ever looked more beautiful than you do right now.\" Shelly breathed, as she came up behind Vada. \"Thanks Shelly,\" Vada replied as she adjusted the comb of her veil. \"Are Judy and Kathy downstairs?\" Vada asked about her childhood friend and her college friend she had selected to be her bridesmaids. \"Yes, Harry Junior has been bugging them all morning so your Dad has him helping set up chairs.\" \"Do you remember when Judy was practically afraid to set foot in this house?\" Vada chuckled a little. \"Yup,\" Shelly smiled and applied a little more blue eye shadow to her stepdaughter's eyelids. \"By high school we couldn't seem to keep you two apart. You were always in your room listening to records and talking about boys.\" \"Speaking of boys, I am so glad Nick and was able to make it,\" Vada walked over to the window and saw people milling around the front yard. \"You know your Aunt Rose and Uncle Phil wouldn't have let Nick's police academy training interfere with your wedding.\" Shelly laughed. \"Everyone is here.\" Vada's face fell a little. \"Not everyone,\" There's one person missing.\" Shelly frowned. \"I'll give you a few minutes, and go check on the flowers.\" After the door closed, Vada looked down at her hands. Her fiancée Tom had given her a beautiful single karat diamond ring and she loved the way the light sparkled though it. In fact the night Tom proposed, Vada had written a poem about the way the candle light reflected off her ring. Her other hand was bare save for the mood ring on her second finger. Ever since the day she nearly lost in Los Angeles that ring never left her finger. A few people had teased her that the seventies were over, but thankfully Tom, Judy, and Kathy respected her wishes to keep her memories of her first love close by. Looking back out the window, Vada smiled. Tom was standing on the lawn talking to Richard Tuttle, the local high school principal. Tom looked so handsome in his tux rather than his daily slacks and button down shirt he wore to work every day. \" You can't marry a teacher. It's against the law.\" Vada's memory drifted back to her friend's admonishment at her desire to marry her sixth grade English teacher. \"I can't help it,\" Vada whispered. She met Tom her sophomore year of college at Pennsylvania State. She was majoring in creative writing of course and Tom was going to be an English teacher. Naturally, everyone thought the Tom and Vada were a match made in heaven. She gazed back down to the mood ring. \" Why do you think people want to get married? Why are you going to marry him?\" She couldn't remember her childish response to her friend's question, but her answer now was easy. She loved Tom very much. One of the things that first attracted her to him was what he said on that sad day back on December of 1980. \" You know, it is horrible that John Lennon was killed…I was always such a Ringo fan. You know, I went to Liverpool once to see them.\" Tom also was always willing to indulge Vada in her binges of watching the Brady Bunch and pigging out on cookies. \"Vada?\" Harry Sultenfuss called from the other side of the door. \"Are you ready sweetheart?\" \"Just a sec Dad,\" Vada sighed and tucked the pictures of her mother and her friend up the sleeve of her dress. \"You would have really liked him,\" Vada muttered. \"And don't worry Thomas J, I will never be a Sennett, but I will always think of you.\" Vada hurried out of the room and down the stairs on her father's arm and down the aisle as a single violin started playing her favorite song from The Temptations.

She was remembered as a great friend, and as a successful published author of many best-selling novels, most of them of romance, and poetry. She was guided by her drive, which was born of Thomas J's love and passion for life in general, combined with her grade school teacher's Mr. Bixler's encouragement, and discovering her step mother Shelly's passion for romantic books. Vada's funeral was held in Madison, Pennsylvania, in fact (according to her request) in the same funeral home run by her father, where Thomas J's funeral was held so many years earlier. Her son, Thomas J Sultenfuss (Vada kept her maiden name when she married) gave the eulogy of his mother, his grandfather Harry, and grandmother Shelly. Her childhood friend Judy also shared memories of her as a childhood playmate, and how in a way, Thomas J had united them all in school and in town with his death, along with Vada's few surviving friends from elementary school, middle-school, high school and college, and her friends who were also successful authors. According to her will, she wished to be buried next to Thomas J Sennett, her best friend from childhood. Still holding a beauty about her even at age 80, and a gentleness and wisdom in her eyes, Judy stood proud. She was a retired teacher. \"Vada was a terrific writer and friend,\" she said. \"There are many authors sitting in the crowd to remember her, as you all can see. Since we were 11 years old, we were friends, from riding our bikes together in the summer, and having girls night out, all through high school. She was a wonderful mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and she was more like family to my own family, than a friend.\" Next, Vada's friends Megan and Lisa spoke, speaking highly of what a wonderful friend Vada was, and how she had been more like an aunt than a family friend to their children and grandchildren. At first, as children, they'd been kind of snobby, hanging with Judy only because her father owned the movie theatre. They had become close with Vada after Thomas J's death. In fact, Thomas J's death ultimately united them as friends. After them came Vada's half-brother (the child that Shelly, Vada's step mother, had had with her dad), to give his eulogy of Vada as a wonderful sister and his best friend. Next came a few of Vada's author colleagues to speak highly of her, along with a few more friends from grade school, middle, and high school. According to Vada's request, the funeral was a happy event, rather than a sad, somber one. The song, \"Wedding Bell Blues\" was played, according to Vada's request for her funeral. As the service concluded, the funeral proceeded to the cemetery where Thomas J's final resting place was, along with her parents, Gramoo, and Uncle Phil. Vada woke up on the grass beside a familiar weeping willow tree at a familiar lake. Startled, she recognized it as the dock and tree that she and her childhood friend Thomas J had fished at and played on many years ago, beside this lake. She stood slowly…looked around. She saw…Harry and Shelly, Uncle Phil, and Gramoo just as she remembered them, when she was in her preteen years, smiling at her, arms extended. Gramoo had her mind again, and looked younger and beautiful. Also standing near was including, but not limited to, Mr. Bixler, Thomas J's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sennett, the friends she had made in the adult poetry class she had taken when she was eleven years old. \"Welcome, Vada,\" Harry said. \"You've made it. You're with us now.\" \"Dad, Shelly, Uncle Phil, Gramoo!\" she said, in their arms. She hugged Mr. Bixler, the Sennetts, Dr. Welty, her friends from the poetry class, and the many kids she had known in her young years, as the smiling crowd applauded and looked on. \" A couple of people want to see you also,\" they said to Vada, smiling as a woman stepped from the crowd, smiling. \"Mom!\" Vada recognized her mother from the videos and pictures she had seen of her in life. They embraced. \"Welcome, Vada\" she said in her charming accent. \"Now,\" Vada's mother said, \"Here is someone who is waiting for you.\" She stepped aside, as did the whole crowd, still smiling, to reveal…Thomas J standing there, smiling at her. Exactly as she remembered him at eleven years old. There were no bee stings or any harm to him at all now. His glasses were gone, revealing gorgeous blue eyes. As a child, he'd been frail and suffered asthma, not to mention severe allergic reaction to countless things. Now, he was absolutely healthy and strong, in perfect shape, like the acrobat he had aspired to be as a child. \"Vada,\" Thomas J said, his arms open. \"I've been waiting for you. Now you're here.\" \"Thomas J!!\" Vada exclaimed. Vada leaned over the dock to see her reflection in the water. She was eleven again, just like in the summer of 1972. She turned back to Thomas , and with a giggle of joy, ran into his arms instantly. She remembered her feeling of denial when her father told her of Thomas J's death by allergic reaction to bee stings, and her denial surrendering to agonizing acceptance of his death, once she saw him lying so still in his casket, his face covered with painful bee stings. Now he was even healthier than he had ever been on Earth. The crowd left, to leave the two of them alone to each other. After the funeral, Judy stood beside Vada's grave, her friend since she was eleven, to say goodbye to her friend. \"Well, Vada,\" she said. \"I know I'll join you soon enough. You're finally where and when you want to be. The happiest time of your life. I know he's happy to see you.\" She touched each headstone of Vada and Thomas J. \"You play all you want now, kids,\" she said lovingly, glancing skyward. Vada and Thomas J sat on the ground under the willow tree, as they did in their childhood. Holding hands, they looked at the sky with beautiful clouds. \"Vada, you've done well with your life. I'm so proud of you,\" Thomas J said. \" My one regret is I wasn't as nice to you as you always were to me, and I never told you that you were my best friend,\" Vada said. Thomas J shook his head, smiling. \"Not necessary. I knew your feelings, Vada. You were expressing your way. You were pure always. And you are.\" He squeezed her hand as the crowd and angels smiled.

This is Thomas J's thoughts during that scene. (I decided to take creative license and call Vada's two tormentors Megan and Lisa because they weren't given names in the film — which I thought was unfair.) Plus, from my perspective, Macaulay Culkin sure did a fantastic job in both portraying Thomas J in the film and doing his character's voice-over for the film's trailer. He's a great actor, and the film My Girl proves that quite well, too. :) Disclaimer: The geniuses at Columbia Pictures own My Girl. I own the fanfics that I cook up from time to time. She'll Always Be My Girl I've got sunshine on a cloudy day When it's cold outside I've got the month of May I guess you'd say What can make me feel this way? My girl (my girl, my girl) Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl) I've got so much honey the bees envy me I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees I guess you'd say What can make me feel this way? My girl (my girl, my girl) Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl) ~The Temptations, My Girl Thomas J's POV Vada Sultenfuss is my best friend. However, she's teased by other girls. The reason why is they're jealous that she has me for a best friend and they don't see the benefits of having a boy for a friend in front of them. One day, Vada and I were sitting outside playing cards when Shelly, a make-up artist her dad had hired, stepped outside. Seeing the card game we were playing, she sat down on the top step (as Vada and I were sitting on the second step) and asked, \"Who's winning?\" Vada replied, \"I am.\" Then there was the sound Vada knew all too well. The sound of a trio of girls — Megan, Lisa and Judy — giggling. Then Megan's voice called out, \"Look, it's Vada and her little boyfriend .\" Vada replied, \"He is not my boyfriend!\" \"I bet you she kisses him on the lips , \" said Lisa. \"You'd think I'd kiss that ugly old thing?\" Vada shot back. \"Yeah, anyway,\" I said. However, I was a little — well, intrigued. What was all this \"boyfriend\" and \"kissing\" business? I had no idea. But one of these days I decided to find out. After all, it can be hard for a girl and boy to be just friends. I should know; I see it often. After all, I have a passion and zest for life. The questions that buzzed through the air like honey bees from person to person, the traditions of summer... it sure is neat. Summer is the coolest out of the four seasons, and so are the colors — green, gold, yellow and red. Plus, school ends, resulting in people having free time for three months out of every year. Fairs and carnivals are set up so people can spend their hard-earned savings on something they really want or like. And the coolest part is, on the Fourth of July, you look up and there are fireworks decorating the heavens. It's pretty cool! Lazy summer days. Free time. Vacations. Trees showing off their leafy green coats. I was pulled out of my musings as Megan said, \"Come on, let's go. Judy's father owns the Bijou Theatre and we get to see all the movies we want for free .\" \"Maybe you can come sometime,\" said Judy. Megan and Lisa gave her a disgusted look. \"Eww — don't invite her . She'll have to bring her boyfriend ,\" said Lisa. Then, as they walked down the sidewalk, Megan and Lisa began to chant in a sing-song voice, \"Vada and Thomas Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. First comes love, then comes marriage, Then comes Thomas J and the baby carriage.\" Judy gave Vada a sad look, and then shrugged her shoulders as she walked off, lagging behind Megan and Lisa. Having witnessed the whole exchange, Shelly then looked at Vada and said, \"You know, Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.\" Then Vada spoke the words I will never forget and treasure forever. \"I'm not upset. I would never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people whom I find to be intellectually stimulating .\" Then, upon hearing those words, I looked up at Shelly and smiled. Vada and I will always be friends. It is sad that, according to some people, when you get older, friends stop being friends. But Vada will always be one thing to me. My girl. Vada Sultenfuss and Thomas J Sennett — friends forever! Well, I hope you like it, and nice feedback is very much appreciated as well. :) Thomas J is a wonderful character, and he's a great friend to Vada in the film. So I prefer to write stories about when he is alive during the film instead of stories ones where Vada has to cope with his death. ~Nightcrawlerlover ","Summary":" Hey there, my fellow writers and readers. :) Here's a new oneshot I cooked up while watching the pa"},{"Movie":"My Girl","Title":"A Juliet Story","Author":"Emma Gene Louise","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5769249","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Well hey there! i watched My girl 2 and was touched at the Nada romance! So i decided to continue the story right where they left off, Nick promised he would come back for the summer, and now that it's that time, Vada is excited to see the boy she desperately loved. \"No, this just isn't right.\" I said, throwing a dress across the room in frustration. It just wasn't right. I went back to my almost empty closet and sighed, hitting my head on the door in anguish. Just then, there was a knock at the door. \"how's slaying the dragon?\" Shelly, I mean, my mom said from the door. After loosing my mom when I was really little, Shelly was a great person to talk about all that 'girl' stuff. \"Not too well...\" I said, beginning to pick at the clothes piles. Shelly walked in, holding a basket of laundry. \"Would you mind helping me fold these?\" Shelly asked, putting the basket down on the bed. \"Let me just put this mess away.\" I said, gesturing to the pile of clothes. \"Why don't I have anything pretty to wear?\" \"Vada Sultenfuss, you have many beautiful dresses to wear. Is this about Nick?\" She asked, folding a baby shirt. Ever since my trip to Los Angeles...and my kiss with Nick, I've been counting down the days until he showed up in the summer. \"No.\" I lied. I was a horrible liar, and Shelly saw right through the act. \"Allright. It's high time you told me what happened between you two. Sometimes it helps to get things off your chest.\" She said, eyes gazing directly into mine, showing love, and trust. Maybe just telling her wouldn't hurt. I moved and sat down on the bed next to her. \"ok fine...but you can't tell Dad, ok?\" I said seriously. If dad had ever found out I kissed a boy, he'd murder me! \"Cross my heart.\" She said, moving the laundry basket so she could braid my hair. We always did hair or makeup while having a girl talk. I told her the whole story, about all the people we saw, and the adventures we had...and lastly about the kiss. \"Vada...sweetheart...ummm...well, as much as I want you to go after the one you love, You do realize that he's going to be your cousin.\" Shelly said, tugging awkwardly at my wavy blonde hair. Oh, did I forget to mention that my uncle tom was getting married to Nicks mother? \"But we're not blood relatives. And I really...REALLY like him Shelly. I've been feeling butterflies every time I think about the day I left,\" I trailed, letting the butterflies fill my tummy like soda pop did. Shelly saw this...well, she at least saw the dumb quirky smile I was giving her. \"Oh Vada...i just don't know. But I can help you pick out something to wear...will that help you?\" My smile got even bigger and Shelly smiled back. \"Oh yes! Thank you thank you thank youu!\" I said, jumping across the bed to hug her. We spent the next hour trying on dress after dress until I settled on a Blue one, that would go perfectly with the earrings Nick got me...but Shelly didn't know about those. And I didn't intend on her knowing. All I knew was that I was going to be really excited to see him. ***One week later*** \"Come on Vada, we're going to be late!\" Dad said from outside. He, Shelly, and Harry junior were all ready to go. I looked in the mirror one last time, fixing my earrings before walking out of the house. My dad gawked and Shelly smiled. Harry Junior clapped his hands with excitement. \"Doesn't your sister look gorgeous?\" Shelly said to Harry junior. \"She looks like she's going out...we're just going to pick up your uncle.\" My dad said, staring at my earrings. \"well, let's go.\" I said, awkwardly getting into the car. My dad looked at Shelly, who gave him a stern look of 'shut up, don't ask' and we were on our way. Dad and Shelly sang songs to Harry junior while I stared out the window. We mailed each other all we could...but it wasn't the same as actually being there in person. *** \"Vada...come on Vada wake up, we're here.\" Someone said, I woke with a start to realize I was in the car, and my dad was shaking my knee from the drivers seat. I looked up to see planes cruising over. My butterflies intensified as I realized I would be seeing Nick very soon. The four of us made our way to the correct terminal and sat anxiously for our relatives. Alright, so I was the only one who was visibly anxious. Just as I thought my stomach would explode the first person walked off the plane, and then the next. And the third...well the third made my heart race, my head spin, and my stomach do flip flops. The boy was tan, with long dark blonde hair, looking around quickly. As our eyes met I swear I could see sparks flying. The boy walked quickly over. \"Hello Uncle Harry, Aunt Shelly.\" He smiled, giving them hugs. \"And hello Mr. Harry Junior.\" He smiled, playing with his hands, making the baby squeal with delight. I waited expectantly for his greeting to me. \"Hey Vada.\" He smiled, and went back to playing with Harry juniors feet. My hand went to my ears, was I still wearing the earrings? Yes, they were still there. Was there something on my face? No...then why wouldn't he talk to me? What about the hug I had wanted so badly. \"Well hello there family, long time no see?\" A voice said from behind me. \"Phil! Nice to see you!\" Dad said, hugging his brother. \"And Miss Vada, nice to see you.\" He said smiling awkwardly at me, along with his soon-to-be wife Rose. What was going on? Why was everyone treating me so strangely? Was there something I didn't know about? I didn't have a mom...was that it? Were they feeling sorry for me? \"Well let's hit the road.\" Dad said, taking some bags and walking towards the car. I purposely sat next to Nick...just in case he wanted to hold my hand...and he didn't. In fact, the entire ride he refused to even look at me! What had I done wrong? Uncle Phil kept looking back at us, as if he was afraid of something we would do. The car ride was painfully awkward for me, but the adults were chatting easily about babies. Rose was pregnant herself, and Nick was chipping in on how much he wanted to be a big brother. I stayed quiet and looked out the window, wishing that he could just go back to California and leave me here to mope. Everyone was grateful to pile out of the packed car and settle into the house. \"Hey Vada, why don't you show Nick where his room is?\" Shelly said, giving me a chance to get away with Nick...not that I wanted it. We both walked silently up the stairs and into the spare bedroom. \"Here we are.\" I said. \"Yes we are.\" He joked back, our eyes meeting once again. Sparks flew and I had to resist the urge to bring him into a close embrace. \"Vada...\" He started, stepping closer to me. Was he going to kiss me? He opened his mouth to say one thing, but then closed it. \"It's good seeing you again. I hope that we will have a great time here.\" He smiled and closed the door on me. My heart sank into my chest and I walked into my room. It was only three in the afternoon, but I still felt like sleeping, my brain just wasn't up to functioning. I sadly pulled my knees up to my head as tears fell from my eyes. Maybe he didn't love me anymore...maybe what was, isn't. And with that I fell into a deep sleep. \"Vada! Come on! Dinner's on the table!\" Shelly said loudly, pounding on the door. I stretched and walked out of the room, feeling great. \"You feeling alright? You've been distant ever since we picked up you're uncle Tom and Nick.\" She asked, putting her hand on my back. My mood instantly dropping as I remembered why I was upset. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I've just been in a...writing mood!\" I said, giving an excuse for locking myself in my room for so long. Writing poetry had become my passion. Ever since Thomas J died...he was my inspiration. He was my first love...and for awhile I thought my last. Then I met Nick...the thought depressed me further, and I just wasn't very hungry. We walked to the table which was bustling with people passing bowls and platters of food, getting ready to sit down and have a great dinner. Nick was seated across from me, but refused to link eyes with me...and instead sat quietly, analyzing the chicken and mashed potatoes in front of him. The adults kept busy with conversations about cars, politics, dead people. You know, the usual. As dinner finished, I excused myself to my room. I couldn't stand being around Nick anymore. Every time I saw him, I wanted to hug him, kiss him, to have his hands on my face like they did that one day. As I crept up the stairs and into my room I grabbed the box under my bed. Of all the things I knew about mother. Then I grabbed the portfolio with all the pictures and new information I found out about her on my trip to Los Angeles. Just as I was going to the page with pictures of my mom, a piece of paper flew under the door. I walked over to hear feet running and a door close. Nicks door. I walked cautiously over to the paper and read the sweet handwriting. Vada, I know I kissed you back in Los Angeles...but my feelings have changed. I think we should just be friends. -Nick Ohhh snap!

When we got to thenschool we went our separate ways. Judy had dram fundamentals, Kevinnwas taking Algebra 2, and I was taking an advanced writing course. Mynteacher, Mr. Johnston, had recently entered one of my stories in ancontest. The winner would get their book published and a scholarshipnfor college. Today was the day we were supposed to get word on thenwinner.

I smilednand took the papers, disappointed but still pleased with what I didnget, and went to sit down. Throughout the class Inkept thumbing through the brochures and curriculum. The camp lookednvery interesting and I couldn't wait to go. I knew Dad wouldn'tnwant me to leave but Shelly was persuasive and would figure out hownto get me to the camp. After school that daynI rushed home to tell my parents the news, but when I walked insidenanything I could have been thinking was forgotten. I opened the doornto see none other than my Aunt Rose sitting at our table drinkingncoffee. She looked up and noticed me and smiled, \"Hey Vada! We'renjust here to visit your dad called last week and said there wasnsomething he wanted to talk over with us. Shelly is upstairs washingnTrevor. His fever is down. Nick went off with your Uncle to try andnfind some shoelaces.\" I gave her a puzzlingnlook, \"Did Dad say what he wanted to talk over with you?

Since Nick was on spring break we figured we'd come up thisnweek. I'm sure it is nothing too serious sweetie.\" She replied. Inwas just about to ask something else when Shelly called me upstairs.nI jumped up and headed toward the bathroom. \"What do you need?\"nI asked and before I gave her a chance to answer I asked, \"Why arenthey here?\" Shelly sighed andnlooked up from the tub she was leaning over. \"You'll find outnsoon enough Vada, now can you please go sing Trevor to sleep, he'llnonly go to sleep at your voice when he isn't feeling well.\" Infrowned at her answer and nodded. Entering Trevor's room henimmediately saw me and held up his arms \"Trevor ! You'renalmost three years old, why do still want you big sister to holdnyou?\" I said but picked him up anyways when his face puckered upninto a large frown. I sat down on the rocking chair in the corner andnbegan humming a song about sweet dreams I'd heard on Kevin'snradio the other day. Soon enough Trevor had nestled into my arms andnwas breathing lightly fast asleep. I continued humming for a whilenuntil I heard a creak on the floorboard behind me. My head spunnaround to see Nick standing in the doorway smiling at me. \"Heyngirl! I never knew you could sing!\" He whispered so as not to wakenTrevor. He came into the room as I put Trevor back into his bed andnturned on a lullaby tape we had bought. \"Younknow just as well as I do that I can't, I can't fathom why henlikes my voice so much!\" I said turning around to give Nick a hug.n\"So do you have any idea why you're here?\" \"Inwas just about to ask you the same thing all I know is my Mom told mento pack and that we were coming here for 5 days.\" He said as wenleft the room and headed downstairs.

AN: This is a personal favorite of mine. I havenalways loved the move My Girls and I cannot say just how great itnwas. It was so touching and heart warming and every time I see it, Incry. Well recently, I've come to a new level ofnunderstanding the pain that Veda went through, and I thought that Inwould post a short little story about it. And I'm just going tontell you guys now, that when I was writing this, I cried… Inseriously cried, and I'm not just saying that to make it sound likenit's a really touching story. I cried because basically everythingnin here in from my point of view. I didn't have a Thomas J., but Indid lose someone that meant a lot to me… \"Thomas J? Can younhear me? I miss you…\" The cold winds blewnthrough Vada's face as warm, fresh, tears slid down her cheeks. \"I wanted to sharensomething with you. Something I thought you would like. I never gotnto show you…\" In her hands, was anfolded up piece of paper. Shakily, she opened it up to see thenpainful words stare back at her. She never thought she'd share thisnwith him. Not this way… \"You make me smile,nThomas J My blood brother fornlife We'll stay with eachnother forever Even after the daynthat we die My friend, my brother When the winds blownfast There's not a doubtnin my mind That our friendshipnwill last We'll stay by eachnother In our secret hidingnplace Brother, you will onlynsee That true smile on mynface For my thoughts havenfound a home And a beautiful friendntoo Thomas J, I cannot say How much I think ofnyou Please stay, by mynside As we spin in thisncrazy world Thomas J, I love youneveryday I will always be yourngirl…\" Vada smiled as shenfinished, yet the tears continued to fall. They just would not stop.nNot since he died. Not since her heart was poisoned with andevastating pain. \"I was gonna give itnto you.\" She wiped away some tears, and took a seat on the ground.nIt was wet with the morning mist, but she didn't care. And as she sat there,nnext to his tombstone, she poured her heart out. \"Thomas J., I wouldnalways think of you!\" She cried out, not caring if anyone heard.n\"Please! Please come back… I need you. My heart needs you. Incan't imagine living in this world without the one person thatnunderstood me the most. Where will my secrets go now? Who will go tonour hiding place with me now?? Who will I ride bikes with, and talknto when my life is going crazy!?! God! I'm so sick of death!! I'mnso sick of being here! You have got to understand how much I need younright now! Thomas…why….why did you go there….why did you gonthere!??!!!! Out of all the dead bodies I've seen, out of all thenstretchers and coffins…. I never once thought I'd have to see younlike that!! This can't be real…\" Vada cried even hardernand hit herself repeatedly on the head. \"Wake up! Wake up, Vada,nthis isn't real!! Thomas is alive….he's alive, and he…he'llnride bikes with me again, and swim with me again, and play games withnme again…… He isn't gone…this is a dream!!! Please!!! God!!!nLet this be a dream….\" Now, curled up in a ball on the ground,nVada whimpered and cried until she couldn't even talk anymore. Shenstruggled to breath as her heart began to pound. It began to poundnout of fear. She missed him so much that the world was a nightmare.nShe just wanted to break out of this weird reality that she hadnsomehow been placed in. There was no way that this was it…Itncouldn't be it… Her life had becomenlike a story without a happy ending… and what was she supposed tondo now?? Wait?? …She would wait forever if it meant that she'dnsee Thomas J. again. \" Hey Vada, guessnwhat we got??\" \" What?\" \" This!\" Hensquirts her with the syringe and smiles. \" Hey you! I'mngonna get you!! I'll get you!!\" She chases after him. Vada managed a smilenthrough her sadness. He could always make her smile… \" Have you evernkissed anyone?\" \" Like they do onntv?\" \" Uh huh.\" \" No.\" Maybe we should.nJust to see what's the big deal.\" … … … … \" Okay, enoughnpractice. Close you eyes…\" \" But then I won'tnbe able to see anything.\" \" Just do it.\" \" Okay, okay.\" \" On the count ofnthree...1…2…2 and a half….\" The lean forwardnand kiss… Again, Vada smiles atnthe memories. The ones that replay in her head over and over again.nOh, how she cherished that kiss. The one she tricked out of him…nShe began to wonder if he knew what she was doing. That she wantednkiss him, and not because she wanted to find out what it was like,nbut because she wanted to find out what it was like to kissnhim…Because she loved him… \" Vada?\" \" What?\" \" Would you thinknof me?\" \" For what?\" \" Well, if youndon't get to marry Mr. Bixler.\" \" I guess…\"nShe smiles and so does he. \"I'll think of younThomas J.\" Vada manages to say aloud, as she sit up on the ground.nThen, slowly, and sadly, she glances at his tombstone. Using hernfinger, she outlines his name. \"I'll always think of you…\"nShe took in a deep breath, trying to calm herself down. Then, for anmoment, she glanced up at the sky. It was orange and pink, and thensun was rising. She began to remember the time when her and Thomasnlooked at the sky together. And how the sun made such a beautifulnreflection on the water… As she pondered this,nthe wind once again touched her face. Where her tears had once been,nshe felt a coolness. A somewhat calming, coolness. And then, out of nonwhere, a drop of water fell from the sky onto forehead. Reaching upnto make sure it was just water, Vada smiled. \"I'll think of yountoo, Vada.\" A voice came from behind her. \"Thomas J?\" Shenasked, in shock. And when she turned around, there he was. Except thenpaleness of his face was now back to a normal tone, and the beenstings were no where to be found. She stood up and ran into his arms,nhugging him like crazy. And he hugged her back. \"Please stay, ThomasnJ. Please stay with me…\" \"Vada?\" He asked,nuncertainness in his voice. \"What?\" \"Will you kiss menagain?\" Vada didn't evennthink about it before nodding. \"Yes.\" \"Kiss me goodbye?\"nHe asked, changing the mood of things… Vada was silent, andnthen began to shake her head. \"No, not goodbye…Not goodbyenagain…I don't want to…\" \"But Vada? You don'tnunderstand yet…\" \"I don't want tonunderstand, I just want you here with me again…\" Thomas J. leanednforwards and placed a quick kiss on her lips. Then, he backed away,nfading. \"Wait! Don't go!\" \"Don't forget tonthink of me, Vada…I'll always be with you. Blood brother's fornlife, right??\" She smiled throughntears and nodded as he disappeared. \"Bye Thomas J.\" \"Bye Vada…\" Another drop of waternsplashed down on her face and Vada felt it with her finger tips… \"Veda?\" She heardnanother voice call for her. \"Thomas J.??\" \"Veda? Wake upnsweetie…\" Veda was surprisednwhen she heard that and the next time she blinked and opened herneyes, she opened them to her father, who was looking down at her. Looking at hernsurroundings, she realized that she had fallen asleep in thencemetery. Her father looked at her with worry in his eyes. \"Are you okay,nhoney?\" She nodded and sat up.nEverything looked exactly as it did in her dream, and she felt weirdninside. Something happened, she knew it. \"Come on, let's gonhome.\" He grabbed a hold of her hand and they walked out of thencemetery together. Fresh tears still threatened to pour from her eyesnas she remember the events, but she held it together. And she keptnthinking about something Thomas had said to her in her dream. \"Youndon't understand yet…\" What didn't shenunderstand? And would she ever? All she knew is thatnThomas J. did. He always seemed to understand things that she neverneven contemplated. Maybe he was ready to go… Maybe she needed tonstay a little longer until she too, understood… and maybe, maybenthat wasn't a dream… ","Summary":" Will you think of me?

Chelbell2016: Okay so now I am making movie fanfic's as well but they won't be posted until completed and they will be created in between chapters of my other fics. Katelyn's POV: I hold my mummy's hand as we walk to the area where the gorilla's are. My big sister Jill walks besides us. She is a big girl and does not have to hold mummy's hand. Mummy says as I am only five I have to. But I am not five. I am nearly six. We get to the area and I play with my coloring book while Jill sketches and mum takes pictures of the gorilla's. One gorilla in particular catches my eye. Joe. I watch as he falls from a branch and I smile at him. He glances between Jill and I. He then moves a little closer to the two of us. I glance at Jill and then at mummy. She always tells us not to interact with the gorilla's but what else are we supposed to do? He wants us to come over to him I just know it. We glance at mummy before Jill takes my hand and we move towards where Joe is. He begins to try and play hide and seek with us which we continue to do until there is a roar. I look around as our name is called. \"Jill, Katelyn.\" We walk back towards our mother as Joe goes to his own. \"What did I tell you two?\" Mummy asks and I lower my head down. \"But Joe started it,\" Jill says to our mother. \"It's not good for them to interact with us,\" she reminds us and I continue to look at my feet. As a group the three of us help mummy to pack up her things. It is time for us to start heading home. Mummy takes my hand and once more Jill takes my hand and we begin to make our way back. It is getting dark and we need to eat before we start getting ready for bed. \"Besides,\" mummy says to the two of us. \"That wasn't Joe. That was Marley.\" Jill and I share a look before we both say. \"No it wasn't. It was Joe.\" Mummy sighs. \"Joe's just a baby Jill. He's too big to be Joe.\" \"Check,\" Jill says and I nod my head in agreement. \"Check the pictures.\" We get home and begin to sort out supper. We know that it is time to go bed right after but I hate bed time. I want to stay up and be a big girl. I plead with mummy but she will have none of it. She takes me to wash my face and brush my teeth. Then I wait while Jill does hers and I hope that mummy will sing our favourite song to us before we have to go sleep. Because I want her too. I love that song. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We head to our room. \"Hey,\" mum says as she heads in just as we are climbing into bed. \"I said into bed.\" \"We are in bed,\" Jill and I say together before grinning at each other. \"Girls,\" mum says as she stokes the fire. \"What made you think that that gorilla that we saw today was Joe?\" Jill and I smirk at each other and Jill speaks. \"We were right weren't we?\" She goes to tuck Jill in and then comes over to me. \"My notes say that Joe is only six months old,\" she says tucking me in and kissing me on the forehead. \"Either I got confused or Joe is a very unusual gorilla.\" \"We told you so!\" Jill and I cheer. \"Yeah you did,\" Mummy says smiling. \"And mommy's gonna write in her journal... that my trusted colleagues Dr. Jill and Katelyn young showed me the error of my ways.\" We all laugh but then mum becomes serious. \"Now both of you go to sleep.\" I reach up and jingle my chains. So does Jill then we begin to sing with mummy. \"Imba Wimbo Wa upepo Wakati Unaji Wa na. Imba Wimbo Wa upepo Wakati Unaji Wa na,\" we sing. There is a sudden knock at the door and one of our mums friend Kweli walks in and comes towards us. \"Excuse me doctor,\" he says and he looks really worried. \"Night Kweli,\" Jill says and we both wave. \"Good night Jilly and Katy,\" he says. \"Kweli, what is it?\" Mummy asks realising that something is wrong. \"You must come quickly,\" Kweli says, Mummy gets up and puts on her coat. When we try to get up she turns to us. \"Mummy can we come?\" Jill asks. \"Stay here sweetheart,\" she says touching both of our cheeks. She grabs a flashlight and makes her way towards the door. We try to follow her. \"We wanna go,\" we insist but Kweli stops us. \"No, no, no, no, no,\" he says getting down so he can look at us properly. \"Stay here children.\" We go towards the door and listen as they speak of poachers. Jill turns to me. \"I'm going to find mummy. Do you want to come with me?\" I nod and she helps me to get my boots on. Then why she gets her own on I loo around for what we will need. Because We will not be able to find them if we do not have... there they are. The flashlights we keep in the house. I grab two and turn back to Jill. \"We'll need these,\" I say to her. She nods and grabs my hand. After making sure the coast is clear Jill leads the way out the door with me closely behind. I keep a good grip on her hand as we take off in the direction that our mother and Kweli went. I hope we find her and I hope that all of us will be Ok. me, mum and Jill. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We make our way through the woods and I make sure to grip Jill's hand. We hear gunshots and I muffle a scream. Who has been shot. Hopefully whoever it was missed. We run for some reason towards the sound. I don't think to ask why we are heading that way. Suddenly something jumps at us and I see Joe. \"Joe!\" Jill and I exclaim. Joe makes a scared noise. I wonder why he is not with his mother. What had happened to her? Where is she? We shush Joe as men come towards us. Joe is in the middle of us two as we keep silent to make sure the men do not hear us or see us. \"She must be around here somewhere,\" one of the men says. \"The woman's got that damn devil with her.\" \"But I think you might have shot her,\" one of the other guys say and I freeze when he says shot. \"These people want to live lie heroes,\" the first guy says and I feel tears come to my eyes as I cover my mouth so I do not cry out. \"Let them die like heroes. Oh! Oh! That little demon took off my thumb and trigger finger. Monstrule! Monstrule!\" \"What if you shot that woman?\" The second man says being the kinder of the two. \"We should help her.\" \"NO! Let's get out of here!\" The injured one insists. \"Yeah that looks bad,\" the other one says clearly indicating his mates hand. \"We better get out of here before you bleed to death.\" \"I will kill this little monkey!\" the first man says. \"I swear I will kill him.\" \"You won't play the violin again that's for sure,\" the friend says. \"Shut up!\" The first man orders his friend. Jill looks at Joe and then at me. She takes my hand and we both sit up and try to figure out what to do now. There is a sudden light coming towards us and I worry that those poachers are back. But then I realise who it is and I look at Jill and point her out. \"MOMMY!\" We yell and I see that mummy is holding her waist and limping. \"MOMMY!\" As we reach mummy we all fall down. Mummy is on one side of me and Jill is behind me so mummy is facing us both. \"Mom there were men and they,..\" Jill begins. Mummy cuts her off. \"I know. I know.\" I look down and notice that she is bleeding on her side. Jill also notices this just before mummy covers her side up so we do not have to look at it. \"Are you okay, mummy?\" I ask worried about her. Mummy pulls both Jill and I into a hug and I am squashed between the two. She then notices who is beside Jill. \"Oh look who's here,\" she says and we both look back at Joe. \"Hello Joe.\" Joe makes a scared noise and I look at mummy. \"He's scared.\" \"I know,\" mummy says and she keeps looking at him. \"The poor baby. He lost his mommy tonight.\" She looks back to us. \"He needs someone to look after him. Will you two do that for me?\" Jill and I nod at her. \"Promise me that you'll protect him,\" she continues. \"And that you two will look after each other.\" \"We promise,\" Both of us say after sharing a look. Mummy hugs us once more. I wonder what is wrong. We begin to sing our song. \"Imba Wimbo Wa upepo Wakati Unaji Wa na. Imba Wimbo Wa upepo Wakati ndotu tamu Una endelea Milele.\" By the end it is just Jill and I singing and I realise that mummy has passed out. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) In a few days it is the day of the funeral. Jill and I stand next to Kweli. The other people there are singing our song as Kweli places her stick down on her grave. \"Imba Wimbo Wa upepo Wakati Unaji Wa na. Imba Wimbo Wa upepo Wakati ndotu tamu mpaka usiku endelea Milele,\" Jill holds my hand and I feel tears fill my eyes. As they continue we spot Joe and we go running over to him. Both of us bend down and hug him. Jill squeezes both and I feel numb from the pain of loosing my mother. We had discussed it last night and found a cave to hide Joe in. We get him to follow us and lead him to the cave where he will hopefully be safe from the people that killed both of our mothers. Over the next 12 years Kweli sees us through school. Joe has grew to a huge size. I am now 17. Both Joe and Jill who is now 22 are very overprotective of me. I don't talk much since mum died. Only to Jill and Joe. I hate myself for not remembering my mother. The only thing I have is a photo of her. Kweli and Jill keep reminding me that I was only five but in my opinion I should still remember. We bring food to Joe every day and play a few games with him. All of our favourite is hide and seek. I just wish that he will always be safe. But there are still poachers out there. And as far as we know the man who killed our mother is still out there as well. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Chelbell2016: I don't know how old Jill actually was but 10 is how old she is in my story. I hope you enjoy it.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Someone discovers Joe. Chelbell2016: I am going to update about 6 or 7 chapters of Courtney Oliver after this. Katelyn's POV: I just woke up from the same nightmare I have been having for about five years on and off. A man without his thumb or forefinger on one hand standing staring at Joe, Jill and I. He keeps saying. \"MONSTRUEL!\" According to Jill. This is about the men who killed our mother. I don't understand how I can remember her killers but not her. Sighing I stand up and head into the bathroom. I splash water on my face before using the toilet. I leave the bathroom and head into the kitchen. Kweli and Jill are already up. I nod at them both and grab an apple to chew on for now. Then I hear Kweli. \"Are you two heading up to see him today?\" He asks us. I glance at Jill and then I nod. \"Well make sure that you are both careful,\" he reminds us. \"We will Kweli,\" Jill says and I roll my eyes at the way those two are acting. \"But you know nothing will ever happen. To us or Joe.\" \"That does not stop me from worrying,\" Kweli reminds us. He says this all the time but he knows as well as us that we are safer with Joe more than we are with anyone else. I go into my room and wash up before placing some shorts and a t-shirt on. I exit the room and we can hear people moving around outside and I wonder what is going on. Why is everyone sounding upset or angry. Kweli, Jill and I go outside and see some very battered looking men there. I wonder what happened to them. Kweli moves over to talk to them and Jill and I move over to the market to grab some stuff to take up to the mountains with us. Jill orders the food and I carry it. We head up to the mountains and I hope that everything is okay up there. \"Hows everything?\" Jill asks me as we walk along. I shrug. \"Good.\" She sighs. She is constantly trying to get me to talk more. But I do speak. Mainly to Joe but that is because I have been close to him since that night. Jill is the only other person I will talk to. We hear a roaring and immediately we know where it come from. \"JOE!\" We yell running into the woods. \"JOE!\" We see him stood and he is holding a man upside down in the air by his ankle. \"Joe stop!\" Jill says and Joe turns to see the two of us stood there. We look at the man who he is holding and he is clearly in bad shape. He turns to look at us and when he speaks he sounds a little horse. \"Hey,\" he says. \"Can you get him to put me down?\" I motion to Jill to do so. I definitely don't speak around strangers. Jill sighs and Joe continues to look at us. \"Joe drop him!\" She says. He does drop him. Right on his head. The guy goes to get up but then he falls again and this time he is unconscious. \"Well done,\" I say to my sister. \"Now were going to have to drag him out of here.\" We as a team drag him out and take him to Kweli. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Gregg O'Hara's POV: I slowly feel myself wake up. I am in a lot of pain. I see a man stood above me. He speaks in Swahili. I do not understand so I try to move a little. \"Where am I?\" I ask the man standing over me. \"In the infirmary,\" he informs me. \"You've been unconscious for an entire night. You're lucky to be alive.\" I groan as I try to sit up. \"I don't feel very lucky.\" \"You crashed your vehicle,\" he informs me. \"It's waiting for you outside.\" I remember exactly what happened now. \"Your an injury behind,\" I inform him. \"The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'Gai Zamu.\" The man laughs and I feel annoyed because of it. \"Oh you think that's funny?\" I ask him rubbing my aching shoulder. \"You ought to try it.\" \"N'Gai Zamu is just a legend my friend,\" the man tells me but I can tell that he knows something. \"No he's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand,\" I tell him accepting the water he gives me, then I remember something. \"Wait there was a woman and a young girl.\" \"A woman and a young girl?\" The man asks clearly not believing what I am saying. \"A beautiful woman and a girl probably in her late teens,\" I say trying to remember what they look like. \"They saved my life.\" \"I think it would be wise for you to see a doctor in Kilimanjaro,\" he informs me and I rub my shoulder again as I try to get rid of the pain in it. \"I took the liberty of calling one for you.\" \"Don't need one,\" I tell him wanting to find the two women and that gorilla. \"But he's expecting you,\" tries to convince me to go. \"If you can drive, I think that it's best that you leave today.\" He begins to walk away and I watch as he heads out of the door. I decide that I should start packing up. But I still think that guy knows something. There is also the poachers who seen that gorilla with me today. What if they tell others about him and they come after him as well. I would not like to let that happen. I need to talk to the women. Maybe I can convince them to let me get Joe a place at the reserve I work at. At least there he would be safe from all these poachers. But first I need to find the girls and try and talk to them about it. Hopefully I can make them see sense. Harry is not going to believe this. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Katelyn's POV: It has been a day since we found the man who now knows about Joe. I am still worried that he will come back. Right now Jill and I are collecting fruit. Kweli greets us as he comes towards. Jill greets him back and I just smile at him. We stop right near each other. \"Our visitor must be feeling better,\" he says and I freeze. \"Should leave the infirmary by today.\" We look over to see him packing up his car. \"Looks like he already has,\" Jill says and I nod my head. \"He's walking so soon? Joe should have dropped him harder.\" I make a noise of agreement but Kweli does not like what she said. \"He's not a poacher you two,\" he says glancing back at the man. \"The man works for an animal conservancy in California.\" \"He can't be trusted he's an outsider,\" Jill says. We see the man looking at his camera and I wonder what he is up to. That man is weird. Not many people would chase a legend. \"He said he was saved yesterday,\" Kweli says and Jill and I continue to look down. \"By a woman and a young girl. A beautiful woman.\" Jill and I glance at the man. He clearly has a thing for Jill. And I would not expect him to fancy a 17 year old when he looks about Jill's age maybe a bit older. \"And what did you tell him?\" Jill asks clearly worried that he will tell everyone about our very big secret. \"What can I tell him, Jill?\" He asks her but he keeps glancing at me. \"The man knows what he saw. He's not a fool.\" Jill picks up our fruit basket and we take off once more. When we are alone I turn to her. \"I'm worried Jill. This man can cause us a lot of problems. We cannot let any poachers find out where Joe is.\" She nods her head and puts an arm around my shoulders. \"We'll figure something out and hopefully the man will not be stupid enough to go back. Anyone who seen a large gorilla like Joe would run usually.\" I nod but sigh, \"He didn't run after he first met him.\" she does not answer she just turns to look at the mountains. \"You ready to head up there?\" She asks clearly meaning to go to Joe's woods. I nod and she drops the fruit basket off at home and we start the trail back to the woods. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We arrive at Joe's woods. Taking off our bags and skirts we look around. Now we are just in our shorts and t-shirts. We pick our bags up once more and continue on. We hang our stuff from some tree branches. We take the flashlights and get closer to the darker part where Joe hides out. I m glad that we are back here. The best part of my day is when we go to visit Joe. Passing the waterfall we finally get there. We shine our flashlights to let him know who it is. He will freak if he thinks it is somebody else and we do not need that right now. When he does not come we both whistle to call him out. There is rustling and then he finally appears. He growls softly as he gets closer to us. We look up at our big friend. \"Hey big guy,\" I say gently rubbing his arm to comfort him. \"How are ya hmm?\" Jill asks as she also rubs his other arm. \"What were you doing stomping around and looking for trouble yesterday, huh?\" \"Your not supposed to let people see you remember?\" I remind him worried. \"Don't do that again okay? Please.\" \"Please,\" he says once more. He begins to grunt and I know exactly what he wants. \"You wanna play?\" Jill asks. \"Okay,\" I say and smile at Jill. \"You ready?\" Both Jill and I turn away to let Joe go and hide. We begin to count. \"One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... TEN!\" Jill had turned earlier but now both of us do. \"Ready or not here we come,\" I call out to Joe. Both Jill and I move to go and find him. As he is very large it is not hard at all but we play along all the same saying where can he be? ETC. We walk over to him and jump out in front of him. \"WE FOUND YOU!\" We yell. He growls and uncovers his eyes. I place my body against his soft and warm fur. He glances down at the two of us looking quiet happy. \"Yes,\" Jill says as we both laugh. \"Yes we did.\" \"Yeah trying to hide from us,\" I say laughing more before smiling. \"You wanna come find us? Close your eyes. Ready?! GO!\" He does as I say. Jill and I go and hide in the same spot. Thats what we always do. We find him and then he finds the two of us together. We watch silently as he walks by us. We turn to each other and smile. \"Come on Joe,\" we both whisper as he still does not find us. Usually he finds us quiet quickly as he can smell us out or hear any movement. We suddenly hear him growl and we know that there is something not right. \"Joe!\" We exclaim and quickly get up. We go racing in Joe's direction and we see that guy again. He clearly did not learn the first time. \"Joe it's okay!\" Jill says. \"Joe run! Get out of here!\" Joe looks at us before smacking the man into a tree and walking off. \"Thanks,\" the man says as we sigh.\"Hide and seeks not really my game.\" We walk over to the man. \"Anything broken?\" I hope that the camera is so I pick it up. \"No, no I'm,\" he sees us holding his camera. \"I think it's okay, I think its still working,\" Jill says and then motions to a tree. \"She can fix that for you.\" I smash it against a tree as the man cries that he has lost his video, Jill and I begin to walk away but the man begins to follow us. \"Hey, where are you both going?\" He asks us both but we ignore you. \"Wait, wait, wait a minute. Hey hold on a second whats the problem?\" Jill answers as she knows I won't. \"You. You're the problem. This is the second time we've saved you from being killed. Next time were just gonna watch you understand?\" \"Okay, all right,\" he says still following us. \"You saved me and I'm grateful. Thank you miss young. Both of you.\" Jill and I turn to him shocked that he knows our name. \"I know who you are,\" he says to us. \"You are Ruth Young's daughters. Did she know about Joe? Did she have a theory on him. How did you two keep him a secret all these years?\" \"By keeping people like you off of this mountain,\" I say shocking both her and him. I will talk to him to stick up for Joe. \"People like me?\" he asks me. \"I want to help you.\" \"You go back to where you came from and tell them what you saw this place will be crawling with people,\" Jill says finally overcoming her shock. We turn to leave again. \"That's gonna happen anyway,\" he says and i stop once more. \"Look I'm not the only one who saw him. An animal as rare as Joe means big money. It's going to be tough trying to protect him here. Maybe impossible.\" \"Here!\" I snap and he turns to look at me. \"Here is where he lives. He doesn't have a choice.\" I feel my voice catch in my throat. I never shout like I am now. \"That's not true,\" the man says and I glare at him. \"That's not true. The people I work for could take of Joe. They have the facilities.\" I scoff and Jill shakes her head before answering. \"A cage?\" She questions him. \"Thats just what Joe needs.\" \"No no, not a cage,\" he says gently to both of us. \"A preserve. A place where he'll be free, from poachers, land developers. A place he'll be safe.\" \"But he won't be free,\" Jill says to him. We once again turn away. \"How long do you think he'll be free here?\" He asks us. \"The next people who come are gonna be coming to hunt Joe down.\" Jill and I turn away once more. But the thing is though neither of us want to admit it. He's right.

Tell me what you think.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Some painful decisions. Chelbell2016: Hope you enjoy. Katelyn's POV: Jill and I get up the next morning. I take a long time in the bathroom. I cannot stop thinking about this reserve that the man has talked about. What if this is the best place for our big friend. I wonder if this is the kind of place he should have been in in the first place. When his mother was killed and the other gorilla's abandoned him. This might have been the best way to save him. But I also know that I will not let Joe go alone. If he goes then so do I. I think Jill would as well. He promised that it is not a cage and I wonder if we can trust him. I go out to the table where Jill is already sat. \"Oh hey,\" she says when she spots me. \"Can't sleep either.\" I shake my head and sit down next to her. \"You know if there is one thing I remember about our mum,\" I say and she turns to look at me. \"Is the promise we made to her. To protect each other.\" \"And to protect Joe,\" she finishes nodding her head. I nod. \"I can't help but feel that this might be the way to do it.\" For a few minutes we are sat in silence. We are both thinking about what our mother would of done if this was her choice. I think that she would agree that this is for the best. I notice that there is a poachers net on the table and I turn to my sister while picking it up. \"What is this?\" I ask her. \"I found it in the forest this morning,\" she says and then she looks outside. \"And here come the criminals they belong to now.\" We both grab the net and race outside. The truck nearly hits us. One of the poachers sitting in the car stands up as his truck stops. \"Stupid girls!\" The man says. \"Just what do you think you are doing?\" We hold the net up and Jill begins to speak. \"I found this in the forest this morning. I thought you'd like it back.\" We throw it over them and then Jill slaps the car hood as she yells. \"Poaching's illegal get off this mountain.\" Kweli suddenly comes running out and pulls me out of the way as the man gets in Jill's face. \"I need to speak to you two,\" he says trying to get Jill away from the men. \"JILL! KATELYN!\" He yelled at me as I would not leave right now. She gets in the guys face. \"Murderer.\" \"Yeah,\" the man says clearly not affected by her words. Jill takes my hand and pulls me along as we head to our mothers office to talk to Kweli. I have a feeling that this is not going to e a nice conversation between the three of us. Kweli hates it when Jill goes at the poachers. Especially when she takes me along. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We arrive and Kweli shoves a photo of our mother in front of us. \"Your mother slept in this bed. She worked at this desk,\" he says to us. \"She died in this jungle. Do you plan to do everything like her you two?\" Jill has tears in her eyes. \"Our mother would have been proud of what we did today,\" Jill informs him. \" \"Proud? Of this foolishness out there?\" Kweli demands from her. \"Proud of you risking your life?\" I decide to step in and speak to Kweli for the first time in twelve years. \"She risked hers. Why shouldn't we risk ours?\" Kweli jumped as he hears my voice. He is clearly shocked but under the shock and anger I can see the happiness. \"Kweli, were just trying to keep a promise here,\" Jill says but she also looks happy. \"We promised to protect Joe. We will do everything it takes to stop those poachers.\" \"You cannot stop them,\" Kweli points out. \"Even she could not stop them. The other gorilla's, they have moved south to safer grounds. Joe stays behind.\" \"Because they won't accept him,\" I say and once more Kweli jumps. \"Joe needs us.\" Kweli sighs before stepping to our side. \"The danger here is building for the three of you. I feel it, and so do you two. I know what the American is offering you two. Consider it. That's all I ask.\" Jill picks up the photo of our mother and I place my hand on her shoulder. \"I think that it is time to talk to this American,\" I say to her and she glances back at me. \"If were going to do this I want to set a few conditions for Joe's safety.\" She seems to think about it for a few seconds. \"I don't know whether we should Katelyn. I mean this is our home and our haven't finished vet training and I have other things that I do here. How can I know that this is the right decision for Joe and all of us.\" I look straight at her and answer honestly. \"What is your heart telling you to do?\" She smiles as she glances into my eyes. \"My heart is telling me to do what you want me to do and go and find the American.\" I smile back. \"Then let's go.\" She gets up and takes my hand. \"Since when did you become so talkative?\" My smile drops a little. \"Since my voice needed to be heard recently. With Joe I always felt that talking was a good thing. With you it was OK when it was just us. Anyone else it just didn't feel right. But things change and if were to do the right thing then I need to also be a voice of reason.\" She nods and we head for the exit to find the American. I just hope that we are doing the right thing here for Joe. Because if not then where will he go. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We see the American stood near his car watching Poachers. We go to watch them as well. Then Jill talks to him. \"leaving?\" \"Yeah,\" he agrees and I turn to look at him. \"I'm heading up into the mountains. See if I can throw some of those dirt bags off of Joe's trail.\" I share a look with Jill. Not many people would be willing to do that for Joe. \"Think it'll work?\" Jill asks still staring at the poachers. \"Not for long,\" he says as he starts to get into his car. \"I'm just trying to buy you some time. I suggest you get Joe as deep into that jungle as you can. As fast as you can.\" Jill glances at me and I nod. So she turns back to the american. \"Okay,\" she says. He doesn't look at her as he replies. \"Okay what?\" \"Okay we'll go with you,\" she says and I nod. He finally looks at us. \"We?\" \"Me, Joe and Katelyn,\" she says indicating who we are. \"We'll go with you to that place of yours in California.\" \"You two sure about this?\" He asks glancing from her to me. I sigh. \"No were absolutely not sure about this. But we'll do this on one condition.\" \"Name it,\" he says and I nod to Jill. \"Were in charge of Joe,\" she says to him making sure that he understands that. \"Done,\" he says. \"Done?\" She repeats. \"Done,\" he says again. \"Just like that?\" I ask folding my arms across my chest. \"Just-\" he stops as he realises what he is doing. \"You two aren't very trusting are you?\" \"No were not,\" Jill says and I nod my head. \"It must be tough for you then,\" he says. \"Trying to measure me up. Trying to decide if I'm full of it or-\" \"Or just a fool,\" I snap. \"Do you ever say anything nice?\" He asks me and I feel like I want to hit him right now. \"I guess we'll just have to figure it out as we go along. Look what do you want me to say? You two will be in charge of Joe, okay?\" Both Jill and I look down as he says this. \"Come on,\" he says holding his hand out to us. \"We'll shake on it.\" We both glance at his hand and then at him. \"We don't shake,\" Jill says. \"Thats not how we make pacts around here.\" \"All right, how do you make pacts around here?\" He asks. I smirk and motion for Jill to be quiet. Time to have a little fun now. \"You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider,\" I tell him and I can feel that Jill is fighting to keep them smirk off of her face. \"A what?\" He asks me sounding nervous. \"You'll have a high fever, hallucinations, you'll say things lots of things,\" I tell him. \"I'll hear whats in your heart. Then, if your intentions prove true, then we have a pact.\" Before mum died apparently I played jokes. This is that side of me now. \"Spider bite and hallucinations?\" He says and swallows quickly. \"That's right,\" Jill agrees but I can tell that she is still trying to hide her laugh. \"The you'll trust me to take you two and California with me?\" He questions. \"Absolutely,\" I swear to him. \"Well? what do you say?\" He smirks now. \"I say thats the biggest load of crap I've ever heard in my entire life.\" We smirk back at him and Jill talks. \"Maybe you're not a fool after all.\" All three of us turn as we hear gunfire. Looks like the poachers are heading out again. I turn back to the other two worried. \"Get your things together fast,\" the American says. \"Were getting out of here as soon as we can. Jill and I go racing to fetch Joe. He follows us as we are on our way back through the woods. We stop and turn to Joe. \"We don't know what else to do Joe,\" Jill says and she glances at me. \"We just want you to be safe,\" I continue as I stroke his shoulder. Joe sighs and the three of us turn to take one last look at the place we call home. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Chelbell2016: I know short chapter sorry.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: L.A and our first day at the reserve. Chelbell2016: Okay so this one is done. Please review. Katelyn's POV: We are now on our way to the reserve. I have kept quiet the whole time. I am in the back of the American's car who I now know as Greg. Jill is at the front with him. I don't talk. I just look out of the window. I still don't know whether this is a good idea. Joe is in a large truck at the back of us. I wonder if he is okay. Apparently so does Jill. \"Do you think he's okay back there?\" She asks Greg. \"He's doing fine,\" Greg says and I can hear the amusement in his voice. \"Okay,\" Jill agrees. I smile at my sisters antics. What would life be like without her? Boring that's for sure. \"I'm sorry,\" she says and she looks at him. \"I'm just a little tense.\" \"Yeah well your not the only one,\" I say speaking for the first time since we left our homeland. Jill doesn't answer she just turns and looks back at the truck again. \"Do you think he's okay back there?\" I chuckle and so does Greg. \"I think he's okay back there,\" I tell her. \"Good,\" Greg agrees. Jill looks around at our surroundings. \"So this is L.A huh?\" She says but then she looks confused. \"Everything looks the same. How do you know where you are?\" \"It's easy,\" Greg says and I turn to look at him. \"Ocean's that way, the mountains are that way, Mexico's that way and Canada's that-a-way. Don't worry about the rest you'll never see it through the smog.\" Jill tries to put her seat belt on. I think that's what its called anyway. \"Maybe you better check and see if Joe's okay back there,\" Greg says. Jill jumps to look back there and I send Greg a look through the mirror at the front of his car. He gulps but looks better when Jill smiles at him. Greg then speaks again. \"So Katelyn.. What do you want to do when your older?\" At first I don't answer but my sister sends me a look. \"Well before we decided that we need to leave,\" I say referring to the fact that we are going now. \"I was learning to become a vet. Whenever an injured animal was brought in I was helping the local vet with them.\" He looks impressed. \"Maybe we can find somewhere for you to continue your training at the reserve. My little brother Henry he's nineteen he is one of the youngest vets there are. Maybe we can get him to teach you.\" I look shocked at him. \"You'd do that?\" \"Only if you promise to finally show me a smile,\" he says and I turn away. \"I don't smile,\" I say and I hear Jill sigh. \"I haven't smiled much in twelve years.\" He drops it as we begin to head into the reserve. But I thought I heard him say. \"I'll keep trying.\" (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We stop inside the reserve and Joe's truck is right behind us. As we are getting out a man, a younger man and a woman come over to speak to us three. \"All right, I'm a little confused O'Hara,\" the man who looks to be in his mid thirties says. \"Because you phoned to say your bringing back a two, thousand pound wild animal-\" \"Hello Harry,\" Greg says before hugging the woman as Jill takes my hand and we walk forwards. \"Hello gorgeous. Hey little bro.\" \"Welcome back Greg,\" the woman says to him. Jill and I turn to see Joe's truck pulling up. \"But security tells me you requested no fire hoses and no restraints of any kind,\" the man who I guess is Harry continues. \"Come on let me introduce you to somebody,\" Greg says coming towards us. \"Well, how are we supposed to control this animal?\" Harry says. \"With a giant rolled up newspaper?\" \"Hi,\" Jill and I say as the two guys and the woman walk towards us with Gregg. \"Jill and Katelyn Young,\" he says our names to them. \"I'd like you to meet Dr. Harry Ruben, who runs the place.\" \"Nice to meet you both,\" Dr. Ruben says as we shake his hands. \"Dr. Cecily Banks,\" he says next and we shake the ladies hands. \"Who makes sure he doesn't screw it up too much.\" \"Nice to meet you two,\" Jill says but I don't say anything. \"And this trouble maker,\" Gregg says and the boy he motions to is like his mini me. \"Is my brother Dr. Henry O'Hara.\" As I shake his hand I blush as he cannot seem to take his eyes off of mine. Joe begins to grunt and thump. He clearly wants to get out. Jill and I look up at him. I smile at my sister. \"Hold on big guy, were coming,\" Jill says as she places her cardigan back down. \"I think he's ready to come out.\" We walk over and make sure he's okay. \"Harry,\" Gregg says. \"I think its time you met Joe.\" While we are heading for the door to the truck we see the land that is Joe's new home. I wonder why it looks so small. \"I know it looks small,\" Dr. Banks says. \"But this is just the entrance. He has the entire hill to roam.\" \"Okay,\" Jill says. \"Jack, Vern are we going to have to hose you guys down too?\" Harry asks and I wonder what he is on about. \"Come on get the sedatives ready.\" I go wide eyed as Jill tries to reassure him. \"No, no, no. We don't need any of that.\" \"Don't worry,\" he says and I turn to look at him. \"We know what were doing!\" \"Hey whoa hold on,\" Greg says and I turn to look at him. \"Harry we had an agreement. The ladies are in charge of Joe.\" Harry looks confused. \"How is she gonna handle-\" Jill and I know it is time to get him out. The men open the door and they look a little scared of Joe. I turn to Jill and motion for her to go first and I'll follow behind. \"Okay guys I got it,\" Jill says and the two boys leave. \"You sure you two have got everything under control?\" Dr. Banks asks. \"Yeah,\" Jill says. Both Jill and I use our flashlights and Jill begins calling out to Joe. \"Come on,\" she says. \"You sure they know what there doing?\" We hear Harry ask Gregg. \"They know,\" Gregg reassures him. \"You want me to come in there and get you?\" Jill asks and I notice Joe finally look to us before getting to his feet. \"There you go. Come on. Come look at your new home.\" Jill continues to reassure him as we step off the truck. Everyone in the area looks shocked as Joe comes out. It is his size. \"Come on Joe, come on,\" Jill continues I don't speak yet but if I need to I will. Joe looks around at his new home as we get out fully. \"Vern what am I paying you for? Get some pictures,\" Harry says and then he steps towards Joe. \"And get me in there to. You know for perspective.\" The man raises a camera. But as soon as he begins taking photos Joe growls out, making Harry jump back. Joe then turns around and goes racing back into the truck. Jill goes to go in but I stop her. \"Its my turn,\" I say and she nods. I go back into the truck and stand next to Joe rubbing his arm. Then I begin to talk. \"All right. It's okay Joe. Hey, hey Joe its okay. Nothing happened. You're not scared of those people are you? Jill and I both promise that nothing will happen to you, okay?\" \"Come on Joe,\" I hear Jill and Gregg say from outside. Joe nods so I begin to walk backwards again. \"Come on Joe,\" I say and I hear Jill's sigh of relief. \"Come on.\" He finally moves and as I step outside I stop talking so Jill can take over. \"There you go,\" she says happy that he is coming. \"There you go. You big guy. Come on Joe. There you go big guy. Come on.\" We both step to the side and Jill smiles with me as he goes into his new home. \"Nicely done,\" she says to me. \"Just like when we were little,\" I remind her in a whisper. \"If you could not calm him then I could and Vice versa.\" Everyone begins clapping and cheering as Joe finally leaves the truck. \"I think he's gonna be fine,\" Jill says when we re-join the others. \"Jack lets move that platform out of there,\" Ruben says. \"Oh no, I'm going back in there with him,\" Jill says. \"And so is my little sister.\" \"No I'm sorry but we can't allow that,\" he informs us. \"You see we don't have insurance to cover anyone that's not an employee.\" \"You're not serious,\" Gregg says. \"But were supposed to be in charge of Joe,\" Jill reminds the man. \"Yes you are and I'm in charge of this facility,\" he reminds us. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Gregg takes Jill and I to our new apartment. \"And I'm in charge of this facility,\" Jill imitates Harry. \"I mean who does he think he is? I bet that man has never spent one night outside in his entire life.\" I nod in agreement as Gregg gets the door open. \"Probably not,\" Gregg agrees as he leads us inside. \"Well, here are your new deluxe accommodations.\" We look around. It is so much different then we are used to. \"We should be out there with Joe,\" Jill says. \"Not here... Not in this... cage.\" I take Jill's hand as we look around. \"Look I know how you feel,\" Gregg says and I turn to look at him. \"It's not exactly my idea of 'Home sweet home' either, but at least your close to Joe.\" I nod and he smiles as he is leaving. \"I'll get my brother to show you around tomorrow.\" I glare at him but I also feel the blush creeping up my cheeks. When he has left I decide to get settled in. So I unpack my bags after it was decided that I got the back room. Then I take a nice warm bath to relax. I try and sleep that night but because of the time change and the fact that it is freezing I cannot fall asleep. Wrapping a blanket around myself I go to get a drink. There I see Jill. \"Mine and your sleeping habits are getting ridiculous these last few days,\" I say and she chuckles. \"You worried about him to?\" She nods. \"If there's one thing me and you always worry about it is Joe.\" I nod in agreement. We sit in silence but eventually we start to talk about other things and then it came to a subject I really did not want to talk about. It was about me so I decided to go to bed. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Chelbell2016: Hope you enjoy.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Joe troubles Henry, and more trouble. Chelbell2016: ENJOY! Katelyn's POV: The next morning I wake to Jill watching some sort of commercials on TV. I smile as her mouth drops open in shock. But then there is some sort of Alarm. Jill and I go racing outside and we see Gregg pulling up in his car. \"I was coming to get you two,\" Greg says when he sees us. \"What's that noise?\" Both Jill and I demand. \"Security alarm in Joe's habitat,\" Gregg informs us as we all jump in his car. \"Come on.\" We get there to see security guards with tranquilliser guns. Jill, Gregg and I jump out of the car. I see Henry stood there with Dr. Banks and some other man. \"What's happening?\" I ask Henry. Dr. Banks is the one to answer. \"He's going crazy.\" \"Open the gate!\" Gregg orders. The gate opens and we all go running in. \"NO!\" Jill and I yell as we stop the men about to shoot Joe. We see Joe roaring. Harry is stood behind some bushes. When I look closer I see what is happening and I feel relief fill my heart. Jill also realises what is wrong with Joe. Joe looks at us and that's what completely gives it away. \"Oh god,\" Jill says and we both bend down and take a deep breath. \"Harry its okay.\" Harry looks at us like we are crazy. \"It doesn't feel okay.\" \"Just listen to us,\" I say and Harry looks shocked to hear my voice. \"Just jump out from behind the trees.\" \"No,\" Harry says looking back at me but Joe roars at him. \"No, I'd rather not.\" \"Just jump out and say 'you found me',\" I try and convince him and Jill nods. \"Well he knows he found me!\" Harry says clearly terrified. \"That's the problem!\" \"Harry do what she says!\" Gregg says and I give him a grateful look. He still is unsure until Joe roars again. Harry jumps out where Joe can see him and yells. \"YOU FOUND ME!\" Joe look happy and begins to pant as he runs off to hide. Everyone else looks relieved now. \"Oh god,\" Jill says and I try not to laugh. \"He's playing with him.\" I move over to Harry. \"Dr. Banks he's playing with you. Hide and seek.\" \"What?\" He asks me. \"Watch!\" I say as Jill and I move away. \"Joe where are you?!\" We call to let him know we are playing with him. \"Where could Joe be?\" When we find him we both yell. \"HERE HE IS!\" We hug Joe. \"Look at you all happy,\" Jill says. \"Huh Joe? That makes us so happy.\" Both Jill and I go running over to Gregg and Jill jumps into his arms. \"Did you see that?!\" She asks and then repeats her question. \"I saw,\" Gregg says. \"He was playing Hide-and-seek with him,\" she says and I know that my older sister is falling in love. \"Its great,\" he says. As they hug I turn to Henry. \"So, fancy showing me around?\" He smiles and offers me his arm. \"I'd love to.\" Jill goes to make a video but as I'm a minor I do not take part in it. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) That night Henry takes me to the clinic part. He takes me into the observation area. As soon as we get there a cute lioness cub stands up and looks straight at us. He takes her out of her cage. \"This is tiara,\" he says stroking her fur. \"She was found next to her mother who had been shot by poachers. We hope to release her back into the wild when she is old enough to fend for herself.\" I walk forwards and pat her fur. She growls softly and then Henry places me in her arms. I feel a light lump on her left hind leg. \"Does she have a cyst on her leg?\" I ask. \"Yes your good,\" he says and then he takes her back off of me and places her back into her cage. He then leads me to a nursery area. There is a baby giraffe there. \"Now the baby giraffe cannot be held as his mother is still with us, he was born here,\" he says. \"We call him Prince as he sure acts like royalty sometimes.\" I smile at him and look at the baby giraffe. We move on and I get to hold a baby snow leopard and look in on some of the other animals. I smile again and then he decides to take me for a walk. We go out around the area. \"Can I ask you something?\" He asks. \"You don't have to answer I am just curious.\" I nod. \"Why don't you talk or smile much?\" He asks looking down worried that he had offended me. I sigh but he had not offended me. I told him to ask. \"When I was a little girl, I was always talking and smiling,\" I say. \"But when I was five years old my mother was murdered by poachers. I do not remember a single thing about her except for a promise Jill and I had made to her. I hate myself for the reason that I cannot remember a single thing about her except for her death.\" He looks like he wished he had never asked. \"You were five you say?\" He asks and I nod. \"How can you expect yourself to remember something like that. Katelyn I cannot remember anything before my seventh birthday.\" I smile when I realise that he is right. \"Maybe your right. But Jill remembers all these things about her and I cant. It just makes me feel like I should remember it all.\" He takes my hand and squeezes. \"I'm sure your mum would not want you to blame yourself either.\" Before I can say anything else there is a beeping in my pocket. \"What is it?\" Henry asks. \"Its this pager thing,\" I explain. I read what it says. JOE TROUBLE! COME QUICK! \"Oh no we got to go,\" I say racing in the direction of Joe's habitat. \"Somethings wrong with Joe.\" (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We arrive at Joe's habitat at the same time as Jill and Gregg. \"What happened?\" Gregg asks as we head for the gate. \"What's wrong with him?\" \"We don't know,\" Dr. Banks says before looking at Jill and I. \"Jill, Katelyn do you?\" \"Is he okay?\" Jill asks as we go racing into the gate. He is roaring and ripping things up. I have never seen him like this and it is really worrying me. \"Can you get in there and calm him down?\" Harry asks. \"Joe?\" Jill and I ask. When Joe spots us he begins to calm down a lot. Jill and I take a look at the wreckage before turning to our Big friend. \"Joe its okay. It's okay.\" We sit down with him and Jill and I are on one arm each. We do the best thing we can do to calm him right now. We begin to sing our song. Together. While stroking his arm. \"Imba Wimbo Wa Upepo Wakati Unajiwa na. Imba Wimbo Wa Upepo Wakati Ndoto Tamu. Lala Mpaka Usiku Uisheni Upepo Wa Usiku Wimbo Wako Na. Wimbo Wangu Unaendelea Milele.\" By the song is finished both Jill and I are nearly asleep. Later on we wake up fully. \"We need to talk,\" I say to her and she nods. \"I don't think this party is a good idea right now. I know its today but Joe is not acting like himself at all. I'm worried what will happen right now.\" She nods. \"I agree but its not me we need to convince. Its Mr. Baker.\" I sigh knowing she is right. \"We need to go and talk to him in the morning,\" I say looking at our big friend who is sleeping right now. \"I don't want Joe to freak out like that again. But this time in front of an audience.\" She nods again. \"Me neither. We both quiet down and keep to our own thoughts. I have a bad feeling that something bad is going to happen at that benefit. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) After breakfast we head to see Mr. Baker. Of course he doesn't care as long as Joe is making him some money. All he cares about is the publicity. He does not care about Joe's feelings or the way he acts. \"Impossible,\" the man says. \"Please,\" Jill begs of him. \"We wouldn't be asking you to postpone the benefit unless I thought there was something really wrong with Joe.\" I nod my head in agreement. \"And we do.\" \"From what I hear,\" Mr. Baker says glancing from me to my sister. \"You two sang him to sleep last night like a baby. Whats really wrong about that?\" I sigh and try to explain exactly what we think is wrong with Joe. \"Mr. Baker we swear to you, Joe is still not acting like himself,\" I say to him trying to make him see sense. \"He's nervous and agitated. And he shouldn't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now. If you can delay the party for a few more days-\" \"Its too late Jill,\" Baker informs us. \"NO!\" Jill and I exclaim worried. We glance at the man at the desk. I sigh as I try to think of what else to say him. \"It's too soon,\" I say to him. \"Miss young's let me give you both some advice,\" he says and I glare at him having had enough now. \"Stop worrying about Joe, and start worrying about what you'll wear to the party tonight.\" As he walks away I turn to my sister. \"Oh god hes right. There's no way we can find something in time.\" She squeezes my shoulder. \"Don't worry. I'll contact Cecily and hopefully she can help us out.\" I nod and we head out of the building. Jill grabs her walkie talkie. \"Cecily?\" Jill says but then we are suddenly rammed into by somebody. \"Oh I'm sorry.\" I didn't think that it is her fault and neither does the man apparently. \"No my fault,\" he says and as we go to walk away. \"Excuse me.\" \"Yes?\" Both Jill and I say responding to the man. \"It's just..\" he pauses and we wait for him to continue. \"What?\" Jill says when he doesn't answer. I don't know why but I do not trust this guy. \"You must be Jill and Katelyn Young.\" he says and I wonder how he knew our names. \"Yes?\" Jill answers not noticing the way I am looking at the man. He chuckles and glances from her to me and back again. \"And you two look just like her.\" \"Who?\" Jill demands. \"Your mother,\" the man says. Jill steps closer but I keep my distance. I am getting some bad vibes. And that voice it sounds familiar. \"You knew our mother?\" Jill asks him. \"Yes,\" the man says taking off his hat. \"I'm an old friend of your mothers. I knew her when she was only a little older than you are Jill. Jill you were just a tiny thing. Katelyn you were even younger. What an incredible woman she was.\" \"Yeah,\" Jill agrees but I still don't talk. \"I'm sorry,\" the man says and he offers my hand which I shake quickly and then let go. \"I'm Andre Strasser. I've come to talk with your Mr. Baker. Actually I'm here for Joe.\" \"What do you want with Joe?\" I demand to know. \"Well in a way its for your mother to,\" he continues. \"I believe she would agree with me. A magnificent, wild animal like Joe needs more space like the Raja preserve I run in Botswana.\" \"Raja preserve?\" Both Jill and I question. He chuckles. \"It's twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run. Here its such a shame to see Joe living in a man made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money. But I upset you both.\" I sigh. Both Jill and I shake our heads. Even though I do not trust this man I agree that the way they are treating Joe here is wrong. \"No,\" Jill says. \"Please,\" he says kindly. \"I only mean to offer an alternative. Anyway, here is my card. I'll be attending the event tonight. Maybe we can talk more about this matter than.\" Jill holds out her hand. \"I look forward to it.\" I notice how he uses his left hand to shake her left hand. I wonder what is wrong with his right hand. \"Yeah bye,\" Strasser says before walking off. Jill and I take off to get ready.

Chelbell2016: Okay so we are getting further along into the story. Please tell me what you think. Katelyn's outfit: Dress Hair Katelyn's POV: I feel ridiculous. Cecily has found me a pure purple dress and I have done my own hair up into a braid. But I am not used to dresses. Jill keeps reminding me that its just tonight. We make it to the benefit. We go in and see Dr. Banks, Harry, Henry and Gregg stood together. The later two turn and look shocked to see us like we are. Jill smiles as they both come towards us. \"Hi,\" Jill says to Gregg and I nod at the two men. \"We feel so stupid in these dresses.\" \"You two look anything but stupid,\" they both say. I have to fight not to smile now. Gregg is still trying to make me smile but I will not give in so easily. \"Come on,\" Gregg says and the two men lead us over to the table. \"Let's get a drink.\" All I grab is a soda as I cannot alcohol at seventeen. Henry takes my arm and I feel a lot more confident about tonight. \"Why are they staring at us?\" Jill asks referring to the fact that there is a group of people staring at me and her. Gregg glances at them. \"Oh they're not staring at you. They're staring at that banana tower.\" \"Very funny,\" Jill says and Henry chuckles along with Gregg. \"Come on,\" Gregg says and he offers his arm to Jill. \"Shall we?\" Henry asks the same thing. We all turn as Mr. Baker goes to the podium. \"Ladies and gentlemen will you please take your seats?\" He asks the room at large. Jill, Gregg, Cecily, Harry, Henry and I all squeeze around one table. I give my sister a small smile. I hope Joe can handle this right now. \"Can I have your attention please?\" Baker says again. \"Just take your seats. I'm Elliot Baker. The world was once a garden teeming with life. A wondrous place to contemplate creation in its-\" As Baker continues his speech I begin to worry as Joe suddenly roars. What could be wrong with him? \"Can I have your attention please?\" Mr. Baker continues his speech. \"Our guest seems to be telling you that I'm talking too long. I'd like to bring up to the podium the director of our conservancy-\" Joe growls again and I share a look with Jill. That does not sound like him. I go to move but Gregg and Henry both grip my elbows and keep me down. I notice that Gregg also places his hand on Jill's. \"Well I suppose there's no need to add to that introduction,\" Baker says. \"Here's Dr. Harry Ruben.\" Harry gets to his feet and we all clap as he approaches the podium. \"Thank you,\" Harry says as Bakes takes his seat. \"Thank you very much. In the time it took you to drive here tonight, three species have disappeared from the Earth. Extinct. Never to be replaced. We here at the conservancy say that this is a tragedy-\" Joe roars again this time a lot louder. I get to my feet but once more I am stopped and so is Jill. \"Well uh obviously Joe agrees,\" Harry says. I turn to the two men and my sister. \"There's something wrong.\" Jill nods. \"But um, tonight instead of focusing on what we've lost,\" Harry says to the crowd. \"We'd like to introduce you to something we've found. Ladies and gentlemen, behind this curtain is the newest member of the California animal conservancy. We are very happy to introduce to you, Might Joe-\" Before he can finish Joe roars. As a tree comes flying at the tent Gregg goes jumping up and knocks Harry out of the way as it lands where he was standing. I step to Jill's side and we look up as Joe comes through the curtain. He looks angry as he roars loudly. \"JOE?!\" We yell to try and get his attention. \"It's okay.\" Joe looks around at us but I can tell that something is bothering him. The whole crowd looks completely terrified as Henry steps to my side. \"Come on, Joe,\" I say as Harry and Gregg get to there feet. Joe seems to spot someone and his eyes tense. \"NO!\" Jill and I yell knowing what he is going to do. \"JOE! DON'T!\" Joe roars again and knocks Jill and I aside. We hit the ground and turn to see that he has sent a lot of people the same way. But he has hurt people. Joe picks up a man looks at him and then tosses his aside. Gregg and Henry run over and pull Jill and I to our feet. \"My god,\" Jill says as we watch Joe. \"What's wrong with him?\" \"Someone has done something,\" I tell her but nobody is listening to me. \"He's out of control!\" Gregg says before pulling his brother along as he goes a different way to us. \"I'm going for the tranq gun.\" \"NO! Gregg!\" Jill says as we move forwards to try and calm Joe down. \"We'll stop him.\" Joe roars out and I am shocked and trying to find the source of his rage. But as he hurts more people and I feel that this is not going to end well right now. People are screaming and trying to get away from Joe. Strasser is among them and I wonder what is happening. He goes to attack Strasser and he gets shot. I turn to see Gregg and Henry. They look guilty. But one or two does not do the job and more of the reserves security begin to shoot at Joe. I feel tears in my eyes as he finally hits the ground and is knocked out. Jill and I look at the two brothers and I feel myself about to loose control. What makes me feel ten times worse is they lock my big friend inside a steel cage. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) I feel my heart break. Jill and I are sat on the other side of Joe's cage. Joe will not eat or anything while he is confined to this cage. The one thing I never wanted to see him in. A cage. \"Joe,\" Jill says but he does not even look at us. \"Were right here. Okay?\" He looks so lost in this cage. Henry and Gregg are stood on the other side of the room and I glance at them before looking at my sister. I don't know what to do right now. But I do know that we need to get Joe out of here. Otherwise he will not make it through the week. \"We knew there was something wrong with him,\" I say to the two men. \"What do you think happened out there?\" Gregg asks. Jill shakes her head. \"Joe would have never hurt those people unprovoked. Something must've got to him.\" \"Or someone,\" I say as I think back to the night of the party. \"He seemed to be after someone.\" Jill gives me a confused look. \"Do you know who?\" I shake my head. \"It all happened so fast. People flying everywhere. Then he looked like he was going to attack and he was shot. I just feel like there's something were missing here.\" Jill and I go into silence but Henry bends down next to me. \"We'll find out what happened. We'll figure it out and get this mess sorted out.\" I nod but I do not feel as if we are going to get it sorted out. The door suddenly opens and Harry sticks his head in and speaks to us. \"Jill, Katelyn? Could I talk to you for a second?\" I look at Jill and even though like me I know she doesn't want to leave she nods. I get to my feet and look to Joe. \"We'll be back in a minute Joe.\" We follow Harry. I cannot believe what I am hearing. I want to scream out loud right now. We should have never came here in my opinion. \"Then the city attorney talked to Baker,\" Harry explains but I know where this is going and I cannot believe it. \"So this wasn't my decision. I had nothing to do with it.\" \"Nothing to do with what?\" Jill demands. \"Joe's gonna have to stay in here until they decide what to do with him,\" he says. I feel like I am gonna punch something right now. \"In here,\" I say and when he confirms it. \"Harry look at him. He's depressed. He won't eat. If he stays in here he'll die within days.\" \"Katelyn there is nothing we can do about this,\" Harry says trying to calm me down. \"Listen Harry,\" I say loosing my rag now. \"Either you tell them you're getting Joe out of here or I will.\" \"Your just a kid Katelyn you don't understand that this is beyond you and me,\" he says stepping towards me. \"Joe freaked out on some very influential people. Now hes a public relations nightmare. No zoo will take two thousand pound killer gorilla!\" \"HES NOT A KILLER!\" Jill and I yell with me practically in his face. \"Okay, okay,\" Harry says trying to calm the situation. \"But unless you can write a check for millions of dollars... and find him a big backyard somewhere, then Joe's got nowhere to go. I'm sorry.\" I can see that Jill wants to go down the road I really do not. \"Harry,\" she says and I look at her. \"Your not gonna do anything?\" As tears run down our face and Harry looks like he wants to say something but he cannot. I know now no matter how much I hate the idea, we were going to have to take Strasser up on his offer. Harry walks out and seconds later Gregg and Henry walk in. Jill and I turn to them and Jill speaks. \"We need your help.\" (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We are all dressed as vets and are on our way to where they are keeping Joe. The guard does not look happy to see us. \"Hey you can't go in there,\" he says trying to stop us. \"Its okay were here to give Joe more sedatives,\" Henry as the actual vet says and when the officer begins to protest. \"Hey, unless you want him to get frisky on your shift I guess you let us get on with our job so you can get on with yours.\" We go in and Cecily unlocks the door the Joe's cage. There rest of us take off our jackets. As the door opens Jill and I approach Joe. \"Come on Joe, we're leaving,\" I say as Jill gives him a kiss. I then do the same. \"Let's get you out of here,\" Jill says to him. There is a sudden noise and we turn to see the officer pointing a shotgun at Joe. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Joe roars at the man. Cecily tries to think fast. \"The gorilla needs medication and I've got to take him to the clinic for that.\" \"Doctors orders,\" she confirms. \"And I'm the doctor.\" \"Yeah uh well I take my orders from Dr. Baker,\" the offices says although he sounds nervous. \"So uh put him back in his cage now.\" Joe roars and I notice Jill move away as Gregg comes over. \"Easy Joe, easy,\" he says standing next to me. \"Officer you do not want to point that thing at him, believe me.\" Before the officer can reply he is hit by a tranq dart and he hits the ground knocked out. We all turn to see my sister. \"He didn't believe you,\" Jill says and I roll my eyes. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We head outside with Jill and I leading Joe. Joe follows behind us and he seems to be happier now that he is no longer in a cage. \"Come on big guy, come on,\" Jill says as we carry on leading him. Cecily opens the door to the truck that Joe will be going in. I am still worried about using Strasser but I do not see any alternative. \"Come on Joe,\" I say as I step onto the platform. \"Into the truck.\" He does as we say and we encourage him when it is done. I jump off of the platform and pass the flashlight to Cecily. They close the door and I hear Cecily speak to Joe. \"I am gonna miss those big old brown eyes,\" she says to him. \"You be good Joe.\" I head another voice that makes me freeze at first. \"Goodbye Joe,\" Harry says as he approaches from behind Cecily. \"I was just starting to get the hang of hide-and-seek.\" Jill and I walk towards him. He notices us. \"I think you should be all right here up at the gate,\" Harry says and I smile at him. \"Someone uh just called the guard away. Urgent business.\" I think the man is shocked that I am smiling. \"You came through for us Harry.\" I pull him in for a hug and I do not know who is shocked the most out of everyone here. Jill takes her turn. \"Thank you.\" \"Good luck,\" he says. While they are hugging I turn to Cecily. Now we hug. \"You write as soon as you and Joe get settled, okay?\" \"We promise,\" I say and then I turn away from her. Gregg comes over and I keep a straight face. \"Will I ever get a smile?\" He asks. I cross my arms. \"Well you never know.\" I smile and his own smile seems to grow. He pulls me in for a brotherly type hug. \"You and your sister take care of each other okay?\" I nod as I pull away. \"We will.\" \"And never stop smiling or using that beautiful voice,\" he says pretending to be stern. \"You promise?\" I nod. \"I promise.\" Then as Jill turns to Gregg I turn to Henry. I take a deep breath and hug him tightly. He leans down and we kiss deeply. I can hear Gregg and my sister talking but I don't hear. But when someone clears there throat I turn and see my sister glaring at Henry. \"Promise me,\" he says. \"You'll write. And you will pursue your dream to become a vet. You would make a great one.\" I smile and hug him again. I turn to see Gregg and Jill kissing and now its my turn to glare. But then the door opens and Strasser pops his head out. \"Jill, Katelyn,\" he says and I turn to look at him. \"We must go now. The plane is waiting. Come let's go.\" Both Jill and I jump into the truck. We see another man as well as Strasser. \"Hello,\" he says as I am practically on Jill's knee as I am squeezed between her and Strasser. We return the greeting. They start the truck and we begin our way to the airport. \"Don't worry you two, Joe will soon be home,\" Strasser says. Chelbell2016: (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Okay I think the next one or two will be the last chapter.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: He killed our mother! Joe is in danger! Chelbell2016: Should have this posted by the 30/08/2017. Katelyn's POV: We are all in the truck. I still do not trust Strasser and I cannot stop thinking about Henry. The truck suddenly goes funny and Jill looks back at Joe. \"Please be careful,\" she says to the driver. \"Always worrying, huh?\" Strasser asks her and I turn to glare at him. \"Your mother was a worrier to. Always worrying about the gorilla's. It made her a lot of enemies. It led to tragedy.\" I lean around my sister and snap. \"Our mother was brave.\" \"So are you two my dears,\" he says but something does not feel right to me. From where I am sat I glance down and notice some sort of glove on Strasser's hand. It looks like he is missing his thumb and forefinger. It seems familiar and I cannot stop staring at it. He catches me looking so I look down. \"What? Its not pretty I know.\" I decide to throw caution to the winds. \"I'm sorry,\" I say even though I am not. \"How did it happen?\" Strasser shares a look with his driver. \"Well,\" he says as Jill glances at me. \"You could say I had an encounter... with a monster. Monstrule.\" He laughs but I freeze as I am hit with a flashback: Jill, Joe and I are hiding as the men that killed Joe's mother are talking about him. They're also talking about how they shot our mother and she might be hurt. \"Monstrule,\" one of the men says. \"Oh! That little demon took off my thumb and trigger finger. Monstrule! Monstrule!\" As my memory ends I realise why I do not trust these men. They killed our mum and Joe's. I look at Jill and it seems she has made the same connection. I tense as I realise that both us and Joe are in real danger as long as we are in this truck. We need to get out and so does Joe. But we are in the middle of the two. We try to fight the tears as we need to be smart right now. We suddenly hear a horn honking. It is Gregg's car. I glance at Jill and then we both look at Strasser who reaches for an inside pocket on his jacket. Jill elbows him in the face. \"MURDERER!\" I throw the door open to the truck. Jill climbs out and so do I. We both end up hanging on the door side by side. We struggle to get a grip as Strasser sits up and points his gun at us. There is only one thing to do. We jump down. I wince as I hit the pavement and the skin comes off my arm. I look up at the truck just as Joe begins roaring. \"JOE GET OUT!\" Jill and I yell knowing Joe will do what we say. \"Jill! Katelyn!\" Henry and Gregg both say as they climb out of the red car. They help us to our feet and Gregg tries to put pressure on my arm but I hate myself right now and yank my arm out of his grip. \"What did we do?\" I demand as we head back to Gregg's car. \"Those are the guys that killed our mother! We gotta go! Joe's in trouble! We have to hurry!\" (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) At first we cannot move as there are a bunch of cars trapping Gregg's. finally we drive trying to catch up with Joe before Strasser can hurt him. Jill and Gregg are in the front and Henry and I are in the back. We finally find the truck but it is not good news. It is tipped over and Strasser and his driver are gone. So is Joe. \"Oh no!\" I cry and cover my mouth with my hands. \"He's not here!\" Jill says as all four of us look around for any sign of him. \"Couldn't have gotten far,\" Gregg points out. \"We'll find him,\" Henry says taking my hand. We see some women going in one direction so we decide to follow them and see if we can find him. \"Copy that!\" A police officer says before turning to the others. \"Our orders are shoot to kill. Hes extremely dangerous.\" I turn around and get right in front of the officer. \"Shoot to kill?!\" I yell and the others turn and come back to me. \"Hes not dangerous! YOUR DANGEROUS!\" Jill grabs me one side, Gregg the other and Henry places his hand over my mouth before I can say anything else. \"Its okay officer,\" Gregg says as they turn me around. \"She didn't mean it!\" \"I MEANT IT!\" I yell out before looking at the other three. \"There going to shoot him!\" \"Not if we find him first,\" Gregg says. Suddenly there is a bright light and I have to cover my eyes as Jill asks. \"What's that?\" \"That's it,\" Gregg says and I wonder what he means. \"We'll follow that helicopter.\" \"What?\" Jill and I ask. \"Come on!\" Gregg says. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We follow the helicopter and I am worried sick. Henry who is sitting next to me takes my hand. I keep looking out of the window thinking of how we all got into this mess. If we had stayed where we were then we would have been Okay. But no we made a decision to come to L.A. Now one of the two people I care about the most are in danger. I sigh. \"You okay?\" He asks me. \"No,\" I say and I can tell the two in front are listening. \"I knew there was something wrong with Strasser. I have had nightmares about him for 12 years. How did I not recognise him? Why didn't I say anything? In short: How could I be so stupid?\" \"Katelyn,\" Jill says and I look at her with tears in my eyes. \"You were five years old. You didn't talk to anyone but me and Joe for the last twelve years. Even then you never spoke to me about your nightmares. There is no way you could have known.\" \"I let myself get attached,\" I say referring to our time in L.A. \"I swear to god if anything happens to Joe I will never forgive myself.\" \"It is not your fault,\" Gregg insists. \"You needed to get attached. You have been closed off for twelve years and that is anything but healthy. We'll find Joe. We will Katelyn.\" I give him a small smile through the rear-view mirror. Henry pulls me into him and we hug. He can see how worried I am and the others are the ones who can mainly see where we are going anyway. We follow the helicopter but we are not sure where they are going. \"Where's he headed?\" Gregg asks. We suddenly see where. \"Look. He thinks thats mine or Katelyn's flashlight,\" Jill points out and I realise that she is right. \"He's going towards the light. He thinks were calling him. That's it.\" We know where we need to go now. I just hope that we find him before Strasser or the cops. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We make our way towards where the light is. It is some sort of fairground. I am hoping that we can find Joe before anything serious happens to him. I also hope that we keep Strasser away from him. We get to a fair and I see that people are moving away. I hope that means we've come to the right place. \"JOE!\" Jill and I yell hoping that he will hear us. \"Let's go this way,\" Gregg suggests. We do not get very far before the strobe light behind us suddenly sparks and we all have to duck. The sparks fly everywhere and we look in the direction it must have come from. Unfortunately we do not see anything. \"What was that?\" Jill asks. \"I don't know,\" Gregg says as he pulls Jill up. Henry helps me up but I wince as he catches my bad arm. We look around and see a bunch of flames. \"Go on!\" Gregg says as Henry and him turn back to help. \"Find Joe!\" \"JOE!\" Jill and I yell again as we go running to look for him. Jill and I hear everyone screaming as they run away from the fire and try to get out of here. We stop and then we see Joe's shadow behind some of the stalls. I sigh in relief as I hear his growl. \"JOE!\" Jill and I yell as we go towards him. We stop when two guns are suddenly pointed at our stomachs. Then Strasser moves the guns so they are pointed at our faces. I feel my fear rise once more. \"Good bye Jill and Katelyn,\" he says and we look behind him and see Joe. \"Meet your mother... in hell.\" \"Good-bye,\" Jill and I say looking at our angry gorilla friend. Strasser looks up just as Joe grabs his arm. As he shoots the gun we hear his arm break from Joe's grip. Joe then throws the man who lands on some phone lines. He tries to hold on but soon enough he falls and electrocutes himself.. The man who killed our mother and Joe's is now dead. Joe growls slightly. We turn to him and sigh. Moving over there we hug him. \"We need to find Henry and Gregg,\" I say knowing that this is bad. \"Then we need to hurry up and get out of here.\" I am so worried. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) Chelbell2016: Okay tell me what you think.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: promise broken and then finally keeping that promise. Chelbell2016: Tear filled eyes as I write this chapter. Hope you enjoyed. Katelyn's POV: We find Henry and Gregg near the Ferris wheel. I am so worried right now as we both go running over to the two men. \"Jill, Katelyn!\" Gregg says when he spots us. \"Strasser was here!\" Jill tells the two men. \"Joe just killed him!\" \"We've got to get out of here now!\" I yell knowing we do not have much time we need to act fast. There is no time to waste. We look around and see some officers heading towards us with guns. They are obviously after Joe. \"It's too late!\" Gregg says. \"No!\" Jill says. \"We gotta stop them! Come on!\" We run over and try to get them to lower there guns. I will not let them hurt Joe. \"DON'T SHOOT!\" I yell at the commanding officer as I step in the way of his gun. \"He's not dangerous! Don't shoot him!\" \"GET OUT OF HERE!\" The commanding officer yells at me. I hear a smash behind me and I turn to see Joe climbing onto the walking platform around the Ferris wheel. \"JOE!\" I yell and Jill turns to see what I am yelling about. Joe turns and looks at us. But then he turns and for some reason he begins to climb the Ferris wheel. \"JOE!\" Jill and I yell again and then I turn to my sister. \"What is he doing?\" She shakes her head but then the officer from before walks to stand besides us and gives his orders. \"Fire on command!\" As Joe puts his foot on the Ferris wheel and begins to climb I worry about whether that thing will hold his weight. I cannot loose Joe anymore then I could loose Jill. \"READY!\" The officer tells his team. \"Officer!\" A woman says and I turn to look at her. \"I can't find my son. And I never saw him get off the Ferris wheel.\" I squint my eyes as I glance at all the different compartments on the Ferris wheel. Then I freeze as I notice something. \"LOOK!\" I yell and everyone else looks up as well. \"OH MY GOD!\" The mother says as she sees her young son trapped on the Ferris wheel still. \"JASON!\" We can hear the boy yelling for his mum. Joe begins to climb the Ferris wheel. He dodges all the flames and moves as sparks come at him. But it is at that moment that I realise what he is trying to do. \"He's trying to save him!\" I tell the officers holding my hand up. \"Don't shoot!\" Jason's mum turns to look at the leading officer who takes a second before coming to a decision. \"Hold your fire!\" I lower my arm and Henry steps to my side as we watch Joe climb up. Jill and Gregg are also on the other side of me. I feel my heart begin to beat really fast. \"Come on Joe!\" I whisper and I feel Henry place a hand on my shoulder. There is a burst of flames and Joe slips. I cover my mouth with my hand and look up as Joe stops for a second. \"Joe come on! Please!\" I say hoping he does not fall. \"He's gonna be okay!\" Jill says. I try to control my fear as Joe goes on. \"Hang on!\" Jason's mother says. Joe continues his trip to get the little boy down and I cannot take my eyes away from them right now. Joe finally makes it to the boys cart and the boy looks to scared to move at first. But after a few moments Joe manages to get the boy into his arm. \"He's got him!\" Gregg confirms. Suddenly there is a bang and Joe looses grip with his legs. He roars as he goes smashing into the Ferris wheel. \"OH NO!\" Jason's mum cries out as she worries for her son. \"JASON!\" Joe manages to get his legs back on and I sigh. \"Come on Joe!\" Suddenly the bars begin to groan and break that are holding the Ferris wheel up. I know what that means and I feel like screaming. \"My god it's gonna tip!\" Gregg says. \"ITS GONNA TILT EVERYBODY GET BACK!\" Henry grabs my arms and he has to drag me back. \"JOE!\" I yell as Henry continues to drag me and Gregg also tries to get me to move quicker. \"JOE!\" We make it far away and the officer had to drag the mother away as well. I turn and watch as Joe begins to yell as the ride begins to tilt. Jason also begins to yell. All the sparks and the fire flashes in front of our eyes as the ride begins to come down. Henry pulls me into him as Joe kicks off from the ride not too far from the ride. I feel myself shake with fear. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) I finally look back to see Joe on the ground. Jason nestled in his arm. Joe protected him. I look at Jill and we both go running over to Joe. Henry and Gregg go to help Jason. Jill and I go straight to Joe's head and we are worried when we see his eyes closed. We stroke Joe as we try to get him to wake up. \"JOE! Open your eyes!\" I beg him. \"Come on big guy open them for us!\" \"Come on!\" Jill also tries to get him to react. \"Open your eyes!\" I say again as my eyes fill with tears. \"Joe please open your eyes! Don't do this!\" \"Oh I'm so sorry!\" Jason's mother says as she holds her son. \"COME ON JOE!\" I yell as Jill moves to Joe's chest. \"YOU CANNOT LEAVE US! WE NEED YOU!\" She looks at me. \"Joe?\" I ask him again. \"Katelyn,\" Jill says and I look at her. She shakes her head. \"NO!\" I yell loudly and turn back to the gorilla. \"NO. NO!\" I begin to sob as I feel my heart begin to break. \"Mommy is he going to be okay?\" I hear Jason ask his mother. \"I don't know,\" his mother replies. \"NO!\" I scream and Jill comes over and kneels at my side. \"JOE!\" Henry and Gregg move forwards as a bunch of people try to come towards us. \"Keep these people back!\" Gregg says. \"No,\" I say quietly as I weep and so does Jill. \"NO!\" I continue to weep and Jill sobs as we both lay our heads on Joe's arm. I feel as if I have failed my mother. We promised. We promised we would look after each other and Joe. That promise has now been broken. \"Don't leave us big guy,\" Jill says. \"Come back,\" I say and I feel all hope leave my body. \"Please come back! Don't leave us we need you.\" We go silent as he does not reply. Closing my eyes Jill pulls me towards her and we both hug as we feel all our hopes for Joe crash. We will never play hide- and- seek again. I will never smile again. I will never laugh or talk again. We just lost our best friend and broke our promise to our mother all in one go. I do not know what to do. Something suddenly touches my cheek. Realising that it is not Jill's hand I open my eyes. It is Joe's hand. \"Joe,\" I whisper so Jill don't hear me just in case. Joe's eyes begin to open. I feel shock and relief fill my chest. \"JOE?!\" I say louder this time and Jill looks up. Henry and Gregg look back. Joe begins breathing heavily. He has started breathing again and is conscious. I feel my heart leap and I begin to cry. Happy this time. \"He's alive!\" Jill cheers. \"He's alive?\" Gregg and Henry both say as they come over to us. \"Joe!\" I say as Jill and I begin to kiss him. \"Joe!\" Henry says and I can hear the humour in his voice. \"He's alive!\" I say as I look him over. \"You big Balooka,\" Henry says as he places a hand on mine. \"That's no way to ride the Ferris wheel.\" \"Joe!\" Jill says. \"Big guy you scared me.\" \"We gotta get him out of here,\" Gregg says. \"Get him somewhere safe.\" I look up at him and so does Jill. \"Somewhere safe?\" I ask him and he turns to look at me. \"Somewhere safe means a knew home for Joe.\" \"Where are we going to get that kind of money?\" Jill asks knowing that it will not be easy. \"I've got some money for Joe,\" Jason says and he looks to his mum. When she nods he steps forward and I smile at him as he places some money in my hand. \"Thank you,\" I say. The commanding officer steps up and goes to Gregg. \"Here for Joe,\" he says before turning to the rest of the crowd. \"Come on folks lets help him out.\" People all begin to come up to us and give us a lot of money. I am shocked by how many kind hearted people there are. I turn to Jill and I know that we are thinking the same thing. We are taking Joe where all three of us belong. Were going home. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-) We are now back home. Today is the opening for the Joe Young Wildlife preserve. Birds fly around us as a group of us stand in the opening. Joe is on the other side so people can see him. Kweli walks towards us with a knife. Jill and I both grab it with one hand each. Then Henry, Gregg and Kweli grab the rope and they cannot stop smiling. Jill and I raise the knife and then strike down cutting the rope. Then we turn to our people. \"TOME FAHURA!\" We yell and everyone begins to clap for us. I hug Kweli and Jill hugs Gregg. Then as I turn to hug Gregg she hugs Kweli. I turn to Henry and we kiss. I notice that Jill hugged Gregg. As Joe walks towards us I grip the necklace that was my mothers. I notice that Jill is doing the same thing. Joe looks really happy to be home. We are happy that he is home and safe. Joe runs off and I smile after him. That night I keep another promise. I write a letter to Cecily. Dear Cecily, We promised to write you when Joe was settled, and now I finally can. With all the contributions people sent in for Joe, we were able to buy a beautiful land preserve that's even big enough for him. We dedicated the Joe young wild life park today, and it was one of the happiest days of mine and Jill's. At last, we have kept our promise to our mother. The people here are saying N'Gai Zamu the sacred guardian has returned to protect the mountains. Other people still say N'Gai Zamu is still a legend. I say Legends live forever, Thanks for all your help, Katelyn.

I do not own any of the fictional characters or any of the actors that play these characters. I am simply a writer and a huge fan. =] Chapter 1 It's been a long year. Talking on the phone just doesn't seem enough to satisfy a young girl's heart. I don't know if it was his adorable smile, his caring personality or that faithful kiss I was left with before I came back home. All I know is that Los Angeles was the best time I've had since Thomas J. was in my life. Don't get me wrong. I miss Thomas J. very much, so much that I would do almost anything to have him back. Life always seemed happier when he was around, minus the fear of having everything wrong with me, not knowing my mother, and never really understanding myself and the circle of life. Since last spring break, I've had new responsibilities. I'm a big sister now, and my father and step mother, Shelly, always want me to babysit. But babysitting doesn't even cut half of my chores for my young brother. I have to change his diaper, feed him baby food (Which might I add it smells like rotten fish… and rotten eggs, put together. I don't even understand how Harry Jr. can swallow something that smells so horrible!), and reading to him on Bingo nights. After Shelly gave birth she wanted to have a settle hobby, and my dad of course suggested bingo. I don't understand that at all. I've seen him play bingo, and when he gets a bingo he's more excited than Harry Jr. when he sees a fire truck. Anyways, it's the last day of school, the last day that I have to do homework, and the last day that I have to wake up at 7:00 in the morning to pretty myself for Mr. Bixler. I had him again this year, of course I was happy, but he was now married so I don't understand why I tried so hard this year to make him notice me more, and how much I was growing in all ways. When I was 11 I had the biggest crush on him, but on the day of Thomas J's funeral I found out that I could never be the love of Mr. Bixlers life. I only pretended that I would be in my dreams, I knew that I'd have to be stuck with Thomas J. all my life, but in the end I didn't even have him. Today was also the day that I would finally get to see Nick again. \"I want to meet this so called Nick guy soon Vada!\" Judy said at the end of class 5 minutes before the bell rang for school to be out for almost 3 months. \"I promise Judy! You'll get to. I'll bring him over first thing next week okay?\" I said rolling my eyes as I said her name. That's all she said to me that hour. That's all she said to me whenever she talked to me. She hardly ever talked to me though. She was always so busy with her super hot boyfriend Kevin. I tried to ignore her, but it was hard because I didn't have many friends. Excitement was building up in my stomach giving me butterflies as I could hear the ticks and the tocks of the school clock getting ready to ring. I couldn't wait till Shelly picked me up after school and took me to the Pennsylvania airport to pick up my Uncle Phil's newly son, Nick. Ring! And that was the ending school bell. I quickly jumped out of my seat but almost face planted into the floor as I realized my shoelace had been stuck underneath the leg of my chair. Great. I thought to myself, this afternoon was already starting out bad. I didn't want to even think about what was to come when I was around Nick. I knew it would be embarrassing. I got myself unhooked from the chair and walked slowly behind everyone else saying goodbye to my gorgeous ex-teacher. I gave him the brightest smile I could but when I hit the entry of the doorway I picked up the speed and ran out the front school doors luckily dodging every person that came in my way. I looked around looking for my father's car, but it was nowhere to be found. Did Shelly forget? Or was she just running late. My heart started to go slightly into panic mode as I thought about how Nick would feel. Maybe he thought we forgot him, like no one wanted him. It seemed that Shelly knew I was in a deep serious thought because right when I was finished with it, came a long, loud honk coming from the right of me. Like everyone else, I turned to look, and there was Shelly waiting as impatiently as I was. She told me that she was very excited to meet the boy that I couldn't stop talking about. I ran towards the car and jumped in as quickly as I could, forgetting that a backpack full of heavy school supplies were hanging on my shoulders. I slammed my back into the seat of the car and screamed out in pain. All I could hear was Shelly starting the car and laughing in the background. She must have seen it coming. Before putting on my seatbelt I took my backpack off my shoulders and threw it in the back of the car. Then I heard a click as Shelly surprisingly placed my seatbelt over my chest and into the slot herself. The next thing I knew, we were pulling into the airport parking lot going up and down each section looking for a place to park. \"Ugh! This is a nightmare!\" I heard Shelly say in a whisper, or it could have just seemed like a whisper over the loud plane roaring overhead searching for the runway. Seconds later I felt the car turn to the right and slide to a slight stop before Shelly hit the car parked on the other side of us. It was a close call, but she was lucky. I looked up at the plane in awe and smiled. \"That must be him!\" I said loudly so that Shelly could hear my excited expression. I've been waiting this moment since one week after the kiss surprised me that spring break. I stepped out of the car and ran towards the driver's side of the car where Shelly seemed to be taking her sweet time getting out of the car. I quickly grew impatient and grabbed her hand and jerked her all the way out of the car pulling her towards the sliding glass doors of the one place where I knew my prince would be waiting. I stood there high on my tiptoes searching for his long blonde hair that matched almost mine, but looked slightly softer than anyone's I've ever seen. But he was nowhere to be found. I crossed my arms and slowly began tapping my foot that became more and more unsteady as it seemed to tap it's self faster. I wasn't paying attention to anything in particular until I heard Shelly's voice pointing out boys around my age asking me if that was him. \"No. No not him. No Nick's blonde Shelly.\" Were things that kept coming out of my mouth but something caught my eye. It wasn't the blonde hair that reminded me of someone, it was the glasses that rose high on his nose. He was someone I used to know. I raised my hand to eye level and I saw for the first time since Thomas J.'s death, my mood ring turned a different color, well different colors. It was a mixture of pretty colors ranging from blue to red. It was a beautiful sight, so magnificent that I almost forgot the reason for being at this airport at this time. I snapped out of my daze and made myself focus when I heard Shelly's soft voice point out more young kids. I was starting to get annoyed when I finally felt like hugging Shelly to her death. I saw him looking around for a girl similar to me and I stepped forward. I was so excited I could barley move. I took another step and I could feel the redness in my cheeks turn from a rosy pink to a hot chili pepper red. I couldn't stop walking, like a force wash pushing me towards him, his force. I smiled as I saw his head turn my way. I wasn't sure if he recognized me because he didn't smile. A few seconds after my theory hit, that's when he finally smiled. My pace sped up as Shelly tried to keep up with me. It felt like I was running from her, but I wasn't. I was running to him. And then, I was in his arms. I wasn't sure if I landed there, or if he pulled me there, but I was there and I was happy. After what seemed like a lifetime but was actually only a true 7 seconds, I loosened my grip from his neck and gave him a big smile. I saw him smile back, but that was it. I could feel myself getting ready to blush as I began laughing for no apparent reason. I was thankful that Shelly was there with me because she saved me from embarrassment. She knew that I was nervous so she decided to start her own conversation with the Nick that just looked at me like I was crazy. \"So you must be Nick. Well it's very nice to meet you. I'm Shelly\" \"It's Nice to meet you Shelly. Vada's told me a lot about you over the phone. \" I smiled calmly as I tried to hold my breath hoping not to invade his space more than I already have. It felt like something was different about Nick, and I wasn't so sure about it. I was expecting a little more from Nick, like answers to my questions that weren't just two words. I figured that he was just tired from being on the plane, which I could totally understand, so I blew it off like nothing was wrong. We had made it back to the car within a few minutes, surprisingly. I opened the trunk and grabbed his suitcase to put it in but I pretended like it was too heavy for a little girl like me, (Which it was heavy but not as heavy as I made it out to be.) The next thing I knew he had grabbed the other end and swung it into the back before I could even say thank you. He then turned to the left and quickly got into the car as I slowly walked to the right now worrying about his attitude. What had I done? Was I not supposed to hug him after we haven't seen each other after a couple of months? I was feeling ashamed. I climbed into the car and shut the door behind me almost snagging my lacy skirt in the door. Shelly pulled out and commented on our quietness as we drove down the road. \"You know, I would have figured that you two would be talking up a storm but you two are so quiet. Everything okay?\" Before I could answer back there was a soft, \"fine\" spilled out of Nick's lips. I looked over at him and saw that his hand was directly in between the two sides of the car seat. Would he be even madder if I held my hand over his like I was trying to comfort him. That's when I remembered what my father said my mother used to tell him all the time. \"You won't know till you try it.\" I slowly stretched my hand towards him pulling back every time I felt I got too close going a little farther each time. I could tell that he saw my hand fidgeting attempting to make my way to his. I felt extremely relieved when he reached out for mine before I made it to his. Seconds later though, he pulled away. I could feel my smile turn upside down the moment he pulled away. This was going to be quite an interesting drive, I thought to myself as I placed my head against the window and looked out at the passing buildings.[Chapter 2] By the time we got home, Nick and Inwere still quiet. When Shelly parked the car into the garage I jumpednout in a hurry, happy to finally be home. I opened the back trunk andnpulled out his suitcase handing it to him. I expected a thanks butnall he did was stomp out of my way. What was wrong with him? He wasnbeing extremely rude now. I rolled my eyes at his back and followednhim and Shelly into the house. There stood my dad holding Harry Jr.nin his hands with a bottle down his throat. The milk wasn't downnHarry Jr.'s throat, it was down Harry Sr.'s throat. I burst outnlaughing but no one noticed but Nick. I put 3 fingers over my mouthnto quiet myself as I walked up to my dad and took it out of his mouthnand placed it into Harry Jr.'s mouth, where it belonged. I showed Nick where he'd bensleeping. It was across from my old room which was now being used fornHarry Jr.'s room. \"It's not much, but it has a bednand a dresser. It used to be my mom's acting room.\" I said. Inwalked over and sat on the bed with my legs crossed allowing mynfeminine side to shine through me. \"She used to come in here andnpractice for upcoming plays I guess.\" I could tell that Nick wasn'tninterested. \"Are you okay?\" I asked concerning. \"Um yeah. I just have a headache,nyou know from being up in the air for hours.\" Replied Nick. \"Oh, okay. Well I guess I'll letnyou unpack.\" I walked out of the room shuttingnthe door behind me. I stood there for a minute before stepping away.nI decided to walk downstairs and check on my dad and Harry Jr. Innever really did say a polite hello. \"Hi dad.\" I said as I steppednoff of the last stair step onto the wooden floor. \"Hey Vada. Can you take Harry forna few minutes. He's driving me up a wall.\" Said my dad. \"Oh sure. So how's dinnerngoing?\" I asked. \"Oh no. I haven't even started!\"nShouted my dad. \"It's okay dad! Nick has anheadache anyway so he probably wants to take a nap.\" \"He did seem kind of quiet. So Inwas wondering if it would be okay if Arthur join's us tonight. Hisnwife is going out with friends and everyone knows he can't cook.\" \"Sure dad.\" \"Alright. Well I'll start thenspaghetti as soon as I can.\" \"I'll help you sweetie.\" SaidnShelly coming out from the bathroom. \"Thank you honey, I'm swampednwith paper work. Mrs. Avery died this morning. She was such a greatnwoman.\" Said my father. \"No! I loved Mrs. Avery. She wasnso… lively.\" \"Apparently not.\" I saidnsmart-alecky. Shelly laughed but my dad just stoodnthere. He didn't enjoy death jokes like ones I said sometimes. Hendidn't think it was polite to the families who just lost a lovednone to hear a funny statement about their death. I didn't want tonalways make jokes, it was just who I was. I put Harry Jr. on thenfloor in a corner and sat down in front of him. I tried to teach himnhow to play patty cake but it wasn't working out very well. BeforenI knew it, Shelly had concocted a huge bowl of spaghetti and she gotnmy attention to go get Nick. I handed Harry Jr. over to Shelly andnwalked up the stairs. I stopped in front of his door with my fistnready to knock. I didn't hear anything, not even breathing so I wasnworried that he had died within the hour and a half he'd been upnhere alone. I twisted the door knob to find him past out on the bed,nbut he awoke my footsteps. I jumped when he sat up still thinking henwas dead. \"You couldn't knock?\" SaidnNick groggy from his sleep. \"Sorry.\" I said not wanting tonexplain my theory that he was dead. \"Um, dinners ready.\" I turnednaround and walked out of the room and headed down stairs. I stoppednin the entryway of the kitchen because Shelly and my dad werenbickering about if Harry Jr. would be able to swallow meatballs or ifnhe'd choke. My dad said if the pieces were cut up into chocolatenchip sized pieces he'd be fine, but Shelly didn't want to risknit. While being nosy I realized Nick came and stood beside me. \"How's your head?\" I asked himnas we were waiting for someone to decide on what Harry Jr. would eat. \"A little better.\" He replied. \"I don't want to risk my babynchocking on a piece of meat Harry!\" Yelled Shelly. \"We're notngoing to feed him any meat until he grows teeth to chew it.\" When Arthur walked through the frontndoor, he caught my attention. I walked over to him and gave him anbear hug. Arthur was like another father to me. He stopped for ansecond and listened. \"Are they fighting again?\" Henasked. \"No, they're just having andisagreement.\" I replied. When Arthur said that it made me worriednabout how well their relationship was. They were constantlyndisagreeing on what was best for Harry Jr. I wondered if my mom andndad fought about what was best for me like that when I was a baby. \"You must be Nick!\" Arthur saidnapproaching the newly awaken Nick. \"Arthur?\" He asked. \"Nice to meet you boy. Vada'sntold me a lot about you.\" \"I've heard that before.\" Hensaid jokingly. That was the first time I heard him joke since I firstnsaw him almost 3 hours earlier. Arthur walked into the kitchen andnbroke up the disagreement and told my father that Shelly knew best.nArthur hasn't had any kids yet, so he wouldn't know what to donbut he knew that Shelly was mostly right about everything else aboutnthe baby. He sat down at the table where he normally sat. \"I'mnstarving! Let's eat!\" He said. Everyone else took their seatsnand piled a couple spoonfuls of spaghetti onto their plates. Conversations arose when peoplendidn't have food in their mouth, everyone but me and Nick. Shellynlooked at me asking why we were so quiet, without even saying a word,nI just shrugged my shoulders. It was the truth though, I still hadn'tnfound out what was wrong with my so called \"Prince\". I wasnbeginning to become very disappointed. When everyone was finished Incollected the plates placing them into a sink. I asked around ifnanyone wanted dessert but they were all stuffed, including myself.nNick excused himself. \"Would you all be terribly mad atnme if I went upstairs to bed? My headache keeps coming back and it'snreally bugging me.\" Said Nick. \"Of course not sweetie.\" RepliednShelly, \"I'm sure we've all been there.\" She gave him anfriendly smile as he walked up the stairs. \"Well thank you for dinner, andngood night.\" He said. \"You're welcome Nick. Sleepntight.\" My father yelled up the stairs. \"Vada would you like help withnthose dishes?\" Shelly asked as I turned on the water. Before Incould help she was by my side throwing the napkins and extranspaghetti into the trash can. She shooed my father and Arthur awayninto a different room so that we could talk. \"Vada I know something's wrongnwith you two. You were extremely happy to see Nick… before you sawnhim, but once you did it was zip.\" \"Truthfully?\" I asked \"100%\" \"I don't know. I was excited tonsee him, I'm excited he's here, it's just that I think he'snresenting me. I don't know what I did to him. It seemed like he wasnhappy to see me the very first time he laid eyes on me in thatnairport, but just seconds after that, he was blank. I feel sonstupid!\" \"That's very strange Vada. I'mnsure he's not resenting you. You have done nothing to him to makenhim not want to spend time with you. You've only been good to him.nI bet it's just his headache. They always seem to take the fun outnof everything.\" \"But what if it isn't. What ifnhe doesn't want to be here. If that were true it would be like wenare holding him against his will. Maybe we should just send himnback.\" \"You make him sound like anpackage.\" She laughed. \"Well at the moment he is!\" Inreplied. While she finished laughing, shentold me, \"If you're that worried about it sweetie, talk to him.\" I finished washing the dishes andncleaning up the kitchen. Shelly had finished a while ago after wenwere done talking and joined my father and Arthur. They were in thenliving room watching the wheel of fortune. I was going to join themnwhen I thought about what Shelly said. I had the words \"talk tonhim\" replaying in my mind over and over again, like my consciencenwas telling me that I had to talk to him, tonight or I might justndie. I walked into the living room watching the tv for a moment. \"Inthink I'm going to go to bed too. I need to be rested forntomorrow.\" I said. I turned around and walked up the stairs. I wentninto my room and changed into my long pajamas and took my hair out ofnmy everyday pony tail brushing through it slowly. I stepped out of my doorway andnwalked towards Nick's room. I stopped remembering to knock and whennI heard a \"come in\" from the other side, I did just that. Insteadnof finding Nick laid across the bed, I found him sitting on the edgenwith his hands on his knees. He looked up at me and I crossed thenroom. I sat next to him in silence as I waited for the right words tonsay to come to my head. \"Nick, I smarter than that.\" Insaid trying to sound mysterious yet concerned, \"Smarter than what?\" He snappednback. \"Headache? Nick you've beenndismissing yourself from my side ever since we found you in thenairport. What have I done that makes you feel disgusted around me?\" \"Disgusted? You think I'mndisgusted by you Vada? It's totally the opposite.\" He said. I satnthere in silence trying to understand what he'd just stated. \"I… I don't understand.\" He turned to me and looked into myneyes. \"Look Vada, I've done something that makes me hate myself.nI didn't hold it against me until I saw you this afternoon.\" Henreplied. I could have sworn I saw tears forming in his eyes, but Incould have been wrong. \"Ugh.\" \"Nick, you can tell me anything. Inthought you knew that.\" \"I do Vada, I do. But I'm afraidnthat if I do you'll hate me for the rest of my existence!\" \"How could I hate you for thatnlong?\" \"I kissed another girl.\" He saidnout loud as I was just finishing my last word. \"Oh.\" I said flabbergasted. \"I know. I'm so horrible. It'snjust that she was having problems with her boyfriend and I thoughtnit'd make her feel a little better, but it turned out to be more.\"nHe looked away from me. \"Or at least she thought it meant more.\" \"Did you think of it as somethingnmore?\" \"Not at the beginning, but then itnfelt like something. When we stopped I told her that I loved anotherngirl and all those feelings went away. But when I saw you earlier,nthey came back. They reminded me of what a bad person I was to evennthink of something like that, of hurting you. Then I felt pains in mynstomach every time I was around you, like the feeling when you'venhurt someone and they'll never forgive you. That's why I didn'tnwant to tell you. I was hoping they'd go away with some sleep but Incouldn't fall asleep again.\" We sat there in silence for a littlenover a minute as I took everything in. So he wasn't resenting me onnpurpose, he just couldn't stand me. But it wasn't a bad thing. Hencouldn't stand me because it hurt him to think he was hurting menwithout me even knowing he was hurting me. Okay, I think I got itnall. Without me even thinking of what I was going to do, I wasnalready doing something. I leaned towards him and placed a hand onnhis face pulling it towards mine.

I disrespected you.\" \"You didn't disrespect me Nick,njust worried me.\" I replied calmly. I felt much better about himnbeing in my home for a few weeks now that I knew he wasn't avoidingnme. \"Maybe you should get some sleep, you know to destroy thatnheadache of yours.\" \"Thanks for thinking of me, but Indon't actually have a headache.

Itnreminded her so much of the first trip she'd taken to Chicago. How hernmother had died. As she pushed back fresh tears, she reminded herself thisntime she has people to look forward to again. Roy had a steady job now andnwas eager to show her around the newly built club. Chenille had a jobnwaitressing at a nearby diner and was spending more time with Christopher.nAnd the one person she was looking forward to seeing most this Christmasnwas Derek. He was coming back from Georgetown and didn't know she wasncoming too. She couldn't wait to see the look on his face. As the train slowed to a stop in the Chicago station and Sara steppednoff the train, she was ambushed by several persons. All she could see andnhear was Chenille's voice and Roy's face. They were all laughing as theynfell over onto a nearby bench. Sara grinned and turned to Roy. \"So, what kind of father are you? Where are my bags mister?\" Roy laughed, \"Alright, I'll meet you guys in the parking lot.\" Hendisappeared down the platform in the rising mist of steam. Chenille hugged her again and broke out into a grin. They startednwalking down the platform slowly, chatting about school and Julliard andntheir lives. Sara felt so happy to be back home again. Roy dropped them at Chenille's after making Sara promise him she'd benhome for lunch tomorrow. Sara grinned, knowing that he was referring to hernand Derek, but still teased him about not trusting her. As they walked up the steps to the apartment, Sara turned tonChenille. \"Chenille, I have a question. Is everything alright here, I've justnbeen getting a sense of terror and fear from your letters. What's up?\" Chenille sank down onto the steps. \"Hun, you know me real good right?nAnd you treat Derek like he should. I gotta tell you somethin'.\" Sara sat down next to her. \"So, sup?\" A silent tear rolled down Chenille's cheek and Sara wrapped her armnaround her. \"Mamma G's real sick. She's got cancer or somethin'nlike that. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've had to hire anbabysitter for Christopher. And on top of all that, Kenny's asked me tonmarry him.\" Sara took all this in at once. She stared at Chenille for a minutenthen whispered, \"Have you told Derek yet?\" Chenille shook her head and put her head on Sara's shoulder. \"I was thinkin' that we could sit down with him. You're as much anpart of our family as ever.\" Sara looked down at her lap and contemplated this for a moment. Shenknew she had to be there for Derek and Chenille, but she didn't know if shenwould be able to handle all that emotion at the same time. Plus her mom.nShe let out a long breath and turned back to Chenille, who had composednherself a bit. \"Alright, I will. But you're going to have to explain it to him firstnokay? I know he's all with the doctor thing and everything, but it's onlynhis second year and he don't know everything yet.\" \"You're just like my sister hun. Thanks.\" Chenille smiled and stood up with Sara, hugged her, and they walkedninto the apartment to await the arrival of Derek.[Chapter 2] The door opened and a loud holler was heard from the front entry way. Derek crashedrninto the kitchen with a grin spread across his face like butter. He dropped his bags in his roomrnand hugged Momma G and Christopher. Then he went in search of Chenille to say hi and see ifrnshe's had any letters from Sara lately. As he stepped into her bedroom and saw the back full ofrnblonde hair he nearly fainted. She was home for Christmas!!!! He let out another holler andrngrabber he from behind. Then realized what he'd done. \"Derek you fool what are you doing gettin' all cozy and shit with my manikin?\" Chenillernlaughed as she walked into the room with a bolt of cloth under her arm. \"That's my new dress I'mrnmakin' genius so get your grubby doctor paws off her.\" Derek looked down in his arms at the plastic face staring back at him. He had been sornhappy thinkin' it was Sara. He should've known better. Suddenly a pair of thin white armsrnwrapped around his waist and a very familiar laugh echoed behind him. The grin was spreadrnacross his face once more and he turned around to look Sara in the eyes. \"Why did you tell me you were going to be home for Christmas?\" he laughed as hernhugged her. \"You're surprised aren't you?\" she replied. \"Any ways, what's Christmas without a littlernexcitement?\" She winked at him and gave him a quick kiss before turning back to Chenille. \"Sorngirl, what's up for tonight. We hittin' Steps?\" \"Duh! Why would we do anything else girl? Plus it's the Christmas Bomb tonight.\"rnChenille layed the bolt down and clipped a piece of it onto the collar of the dress. \"But first Irnneed you to try on this dress I'm makin' for one of the girls at work for Christmas. You're aboutrnher size.\" She gave Derek a stern look.\" I know how much you want to stay, but there's no chancernbig shot.\" Derek kissed Sara again and headed out of his sisters room, listening closely to the jinglernof laughing behind him. Man how he loved Christmas. ______________________________________________________________________________ \"When are we gonna tell him Chenille?\" Sara mumbled under the silver/blue fabric beingrnstretched over her head. Chenille sighed and stepped back to look at the dress.\"Lets try tomorrow hun. Let himrnhave one night of ultimate fun with his girl, then he can take the bad news.\" \"Along with the good I'm assuming?\" Sara looked at her, wondering about Kenny'srnproposal. \"Yeah,\" Chenille said flatly,\"along with the good.\"[Chapter 3] The music blasted through the doors as they entered the infamous Steps. The one placernwhere Sara now felt at home, even under the watchful eyes of Nikki, her \"arch-rival\" who hadrntried to steal Derek from Sara even though she had tossed him back first. As they sat on one ofrnthe upper platforms, Sara bobbed her head to the beat of Ice Cube, Put Your Back Into It. She nuzzled her lips within an inch of his ear and spoke loud enough for only him to hearrn\"Do you remember this song?\" He smiled at her and said back \"Do you remember the look on Nikki's face?\" They both broke out in fits of laughter and he slung his arm around her waist. From therncorner of her eye, Sara noticed Chenille glaring at something. Sliding over on the couch to talk tornher best friend, Sara craned her neck to see what Chenille was glaring at on the dance floor. Thenrnshe spotted him. \"Ya know Sara, this is why I was so disgusted with him when he asked me that. When hernstarter playin' with the question of marryin' my ass and then he goes out and hangs off that niggahrnthat doesn't look older than 16!! He thinks he's so big time up there. I should get Snook to kickrnhis ass right out of this place. Its too good for a low life of his magnitude.\" Down on the dance floor Sara couldn't believe her eyes. The once, as she had thought,rnmore sensible Kenny had his hands down the front of some girls skirt. Sara cringed in disgustrnand turned back to the pissed off look Chenille was shooting in his direction. \"You want Derek to kick his ass?\" A smile played across Chenille's lips as she took her eyes off Christopher's father andrnback at Sara. \"No hun that's all good. I'm gonna do it myself.\" Chenille stood up before Sara could say anything and strutted down the winding stepsrntowards the dance floor. Sara quickly slipped back to Derek and hissed in his ear \"Watch ourrnbacks. The snake king just pissed her off and she's on the warpath. I get to play backup tonight.\" Derek watched openmouthed as she turned for the stairs and hurried towards his sister. What thernhell was going on here?! ______________________________________________________________________________ \"Yo! Kenny! Sup?\" Kenny's eyes opened wide as he slowly turned to face the oh so familiar face of Chenille.rnHe knew he was in shit, he could hear it in her voice. \"Now Chenille don't get worked up I was just..\" *WHAP* \"What the hell's up with you bitch? All I was doin' was dancin'!\" Kenny clutched his jaw where Chenille had landed a very nice right hook. But the daggersrnshe was staring at him made him shut up the second after the words were out of his mouth. \"You cheatin' SOB I should get your ass kicked out of this place and so far out of this cityrnthat you'll be able to see China but you know what Kenny? I'm not going to because you justrnproposed to me two days ago and I don't really feel like explaining this to everybody againrntomorrow!\" The music slowly died as Snook and everybody else turned to stare at the red facedrnChenille. \"And for another thing, that thing you were dancing with is no longer in this club either. Irnswear Kenny if you weren't my baby's father and I needed your money that never comes, I'd killrnyou right here and now.\" She turned to the crowd around her and yelled \"HERE STANDS THErnMOST COWARDLY BROTHA I'VE EVER LAID EYES ON. HE'S MY BABY'S FATHERrnAND HE PROPOSED YESTERDAY, BUT HERE HE IS NOW, HANGIN OFF HIS GIRLSrnAGAIN SO I'LL TELL YA'LL WHAT. I'M GONNA REFUSE, AS ALL YOU LADIESrnSHOULD IN THE FUTURE.\" Derek stood openmouthed down at his sister. That creep had proposed?? Why hadn't sherntold him?? \"Uh Oh...\" he thought, \"I better get down there before...\" Chenille stormed out the door and when Kenny looked up, all he saw was fist. *WHAP* He looked up from the floor holding his broken nose with blood on his hands at the only whiterngirl ever allowed in the club. Sara stared back at him and with on sentence, said it all. \"That was for cheating on my sister.\"[Chapter 4] \"Chenille! Wait up!\" Derek bounded up alongside of Chenille with Sara at his side, both out of breath, a fewrnblocks away from Steps. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" Chenille looked down at the ground as she was walking fast with tears streaming downrnher face. She couldn't bare to face him and his questions right now. She looked at Sara with arnpleading look on her face. Sara sighed and knew what her friend ment. \"Derek, why don't we go for a walk and then head back home to talk to Chenille?\" \"A'ight, just as long as YOU tell me what's goin' on in my life...\" The couple split away from Chenille and walked around the corner to a small diner.rnSitting at a small table in the back corner, Sara filled Derek in on all that Chenille told her thatrnafternoon. Derek looked down into his coffee with an expressionless face. The anger was bubblingrnup inside him and he had half a mind to go back to Steps and punch Kenny a third time over. Yetrnthe heavy feeling of Chenille's feelings and Momma G's sickness hung over him like arndeadweight. Sara put her hand on his arm as a silent tear rolled down his cheek. There was so muchrnpain built up inside of there and she knew it. His mom never being around, and not knowing hisrndad. Now his sister and grandmother being attacked too and he was helpless to stop anything. She could see in his eyes the way his heart was breaking. \"Do you know how sick she is?\" he asked in a raspy voice. \"Not yet, we have to go and talk to Chenille soon. She just needed some time to calmrndown. I can't believe that jerk.\" Derek snorted. \"At least it wasn't Nikki he had his paws on. Then there woulda been some serious bloodrngoin' on at Steps tonight.\" \"Yeah Derek, but still. How could he be so stupid and unfeeling and...mean?\" Derek looked out the window at the stragglers coming out of the store across the streetrnafter Christmas shopping. A few lazy snowflakes drifted down onto the iced sidewalks and street. \"You don't know the past of Kenny Sara. He's always been hurtin' someone in one way orrnanother. He's been messing up his life and everyone elses from the day he was born.\" Sara looked at him and decided not to take it any further. They had to go talk to Chenille. ______________________________________________________________________________ They walked in the door, hand in hand to find Christopher and Momma G sleeping. Sararnknocked lightly on Chenille's bedroom door and slowly entered. She was sitting on her bed, herrnonce tear-streaked face now dry and sad. The look on her face Sara had never seen before. It wasrnone of sadness and worthlessness. And it scared her to see it on Chenille. \"I'm not marrying him.\" \"Well, I'd understand that perfectly, after what he pulled tonight.\" Sara replied, pullingrnChenille into her arms. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner Derek, but I didn't want you worryin' the first night backrnwith Sara. I didn't want to ruin your mood.\" \"Its alright Chenille,\" Derek said, staring at her,\"I know why.\" Chenille sighed. \"She's dying Derek.\" Derek stared at her for what seemed eternity to all of them, no one saying anything. \"How long do they say she has left?\" A silent tear rolled down Chenille's cheek. \"They don't know. Its breast cancer. It could berntomorrow, next week, next month, or 5 years from now. They just don't know.\" Derek looked up at the ceiling. None of them felt like pursuing the conversation anyrnlonger. It was too new and too emotional. Sara turned to Derek. \"Do you want to come over to my place?\" Chenille looked at Sara thankfully, not knowing what she would do if she saw Derek cry.rnShe hadn't seen him cry since he was nine. She didn't know how she would handle it. \"Yeah.\" ______________________________________________________________________________ They lay in the dark of her room, with his head on her stomach. Thinking. As the tearsrnstarted rolling down Derek's face again, Sara thought to herself. \"Why them? Why two people inrnmy life that have done everything for me? Why am I so helpless...\"[Chapter 5] Derek woke up with the sun shining on his face. He yawned and looked up at Sara, still sleeping peacefully. He sighed andrnthought about the events of last night. Why could something like this happen to all of us? Momma G's been the best ever tornus...and Chenille doesn't deserve that good for nothin' jerk. He closed his eyes again and tried to wipe it all away. He knewrnhe couldn't. He looked back up to Sara. She looked so peaceful...how did he ever deserve this angel? He smiled to himselfrnas he thought \"They always said angels dressed in all colours...\" A smile played across Sara's lips as she opened her eyes and realized that Derek was watching her sleep. She smiled andrnslid down under the blue comforter with him. He was smiling at her and she knew it was going to be a rare thing for thernnext little while. \"Your wearing those geeky chick pyjamas again\" he laughed into her stomach. \"Yeah well you're wearing green silk so I wouldn't be talking. We don't exactly match Mister!\" They both stoped laughing and looked at each other. Derek caressed the side of her face with his hand and sighed. \"I love you so much...\" Sara's eyes brimmed up with tears and she bit her lip. \"I love you too...and I'm here for you. You're not alone in this and don't you ever forget it. Ever. You're not allowed to.\" \"Like I would. How could I ever forget you? All the tears we've shared? Its just brings our lives this much closerrntogether...its amazing really.\" \"SARA!\" Sara stuck her head out from the blanket, and smiled at Roy's uncanny ability to ruin the moment in every sense. Derekrnstuck his head out long enough to kiss her passionately, then duck back down into the warmth of the bed. Roy walked into Sara's bedroom with two plates of pancakes. \"Good morning sweetheart. Mornin' Derek.\" Derek pulled his head back out and smiled at Roy. \"You kids are going to have to come eat at the table because I'm sick and tired of Sara cleaning her bed.\" \"Roy, I only lived here for 2 months before going to Julliard and when did I clean my bed?\" Roy smiled and them and walked out of the room, leaving the two of them puzzled and confused. Sara looked down at Derek and let out a short sigh. How could she be thinking of fun when her boyfriends grandmotherrnwas dying and her best friend had just been hurt so much by her now ex-lover. She gazed at the ceiling and rubbed Derek'srnback as they both lay there, knowing that they were both thinking the same thing. Mamma G's sickness was hitting them allrnwhere it really hurts. The heart. She thought of how everyone was going to take it if Mamma G actually died. \"Wakernyourself up Sara.\" she said to herself, \"Of course Mamma G's gonna die. She's really old and she's got cancer and...oh myrngosh I don't know. I just don't know what to do. I care about these people so much and I don't know what to do. I wish momrnwere still here. She's know what to do...but she wasn't there. She wasn't there to help me with her death, Derek was. Andrnknow I have to be here for him when someone close to him dies. Oh but Derek didn't know you mom! I know Mamma Grnand I don't know how I'M going to take it let alone Derek and Chenille...\" Derek looked up at Sara, deep in thought. He didn't know how she could be so strong, but at the end of the day still haverntime to cry for everyone. As long as he had known her she'd been a strong person. He knew he had helped her with herrnmom's death and by the look on her face, he'd say that was exactly what she was thinking about. \"Well,\" Sara started, \"I guess we'd better get out there before Roy comes in, rips the blankets off and discovers what you'rernreally wearing.\"rn___________________________________________________________________________________________________ When they got back to the apartment, Chenille didn't let any of them have a second to talk for they were put to workrnimmediately. She got Derek to take Christopher out to the playground while her and Sara put the finishing touches on thernlatest dress. Then they were all busy once again cooking, cleaning and putting stuff away. Chenille had decided to givernMamma G a day off and had sent her out to get some air, go for a walk and go visit a few of her friends. They put the dayrnaside to forget everything last night had brought them and really just let themselves go numb. When Mamma G returnedrnshe insisted that they all go to Steps again because they had given her such a wonderful gift of a day off. Chenille grinned. \"Don't worry Mamma G, we were goin' ta hit Steps anyways. Don't we always?\"rn___________________________________________________________________________________________________ Nikki looked up at the flow of people coming in the door and groaned in disgust. They were always here weren't they. Thernband off the happy niggahs and the little white girl. All cosy and shit. Made her want to puke. Suddenly, she noticed anrneven more familiar face walk in the door. \"Hmm,\" she thought to herself, \"I didn't know he was out yet.\" A smile crept itsrnway across her face. \"Just my luck, I'm gonna have me some fun tonight.\"rn___________________________________________________________________________________________________ Sara looked around the tight packed club of Steps. A few familiar faces popped out in the crowd and she waved at Snooksrnon his platform. Out of the corner of her eye she caught Nikki glaring at her, which only made her cling off Derek evenrnmore, not that he minded or anything. When Nikki's eyes left the couple, Sara saw her smile, which was never a good thing.rnShe turned to look and see who was coming in the open double doors. Oh. My. Gosh. She grabbed Derek's arm and pulled him over to one side, watching Chenille walk away with one of the guys from around.rnShe hissed in his ear, \"Look over by the bar and see which friend just made his guest appearence!\" Derek looked over his shoulder to surprisingly come face to face, Malachi. \"Sup Derek?\" Derek was at a loss for words. He thought they had locked him up for some serious time! \"Surprised to see me? Well I got out on bail. Cost those stupid niggahs I call parents to hop a account or two, but I'm out.\" Derek regained his composure. \"So Malachi, what are you planning to do now? Gonna kill me for not goin' with ya'll?\" Malachi looked down in disgust. \"Ya know Derek? I expected more from you. Course I'm not gonna bust ya ass! You're marnbrotha! No matter what shit went down then and you're not on ma back, its all good in this hood.\" \"Well, I'm bein' pulled out to bust a cap bro, so I'm gonna jet.\" Derek was towed away slowly by Sara and a look of disgust implanted itself on Malachi's face. \"Stupid niggah.\" Then he felt the hands around his waist. He looked down to the familiar black manicured nails. \"Damn,\" he thought, \"I'mrngonna get it on now...\" He turned to face Nikki with a half smile on his face. \"Sup beautiful?\" \"I'm bustin' my ass Malachi! I'm standin' here about to bust a cap if we don't get out there and get it on, its been so long..\" With the look on her face and the feelings Malachi had about tonight, he pulled Nikki close, grabbed her ass, and walkedrndown to the dance floor. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________[Chapter 6] Sara spunrnaround again and again staring at the ceiling high above her. The music blastedrnthrough the speakers in four corners around her and it was going straight tornher heart. It was the only place she could feel safe, happy and close to herrnmom all at the same time.xa0 But tonightrnit wasn't doing much and she longed to be whisked away to a place where no onerncould touch her. Unfortunately, Nikki chose that moment to bump into her,rnsending her sprawling to the floor. \"Oh sorryrnBarbie, didn't mean to get your white lace in a bundle\" Nikki mocked in arnfalsetto voice. \"Bite me.\"rnSara replied as Derek swept her back into his arms and swung her into arnbouncing dip, accompanied by a passionate kiss. Which Sara was sure was his ownrnlittle way of retaliating against Nikki. She placed a sappy grin on her facernand danced closer to him. \"Snooks picked the perfect time to switch into a slowrnsong…\" Sara thought to herself as Derek swung her around again and pulled herrncloser.xa0 Looking back up at the ceiling,rnshe caught a glace in a mirror that startled her almost more than seeingrnMalachi out and about again. Nikki and Malachi making out. Itrnalmost made her want to laugh, if it wasn't that surprisingly disturbing. Shernturned her head on Derek's shoulder and asked him if he knew what was uprnbetween the two antagonists. He whirled her around, shrugged, and pulled herrnoff the dance floor to get a drink. Their day had been hard and they neededrnsome real music to pick up the beat and make them drift into forgetting. As ifrnSnooks read her mind, Chenille was pleased to hear MaryMary's \"I Sings\" startrnto blast out from all corners of the room. She laughed, ran up the stepsrntowards the scratch table and grabbed Snooks arm. \"Common'rnFluffy, we're getting this one on.\" She said with a grin at the surprised lookrnon his face. \"Well,rnJunior CAN take over for a minute…\" he stuttered back as he was pulled down thernsteps towards the dance floor. He did like Chenille, but was surprised. Shernwasn't usually like this… \"Well, yournwant to head back to my place or not?\" Nikki whispered into Malachi's ear. \"Damn girl,rnwatcha think I'd be? Some kinda proper gentlemen from Georgetown and shit likernthat? Of course I'm draggin' your sorry ass back to your place. Is your mammarngonna be followin' me though?\" \"Hell no.rnShe got in a bar fight last night and knocked a couple teeth out of a drunk.rnShe won't come back til who cares when. I got the whole place with you…whereverrnyou want.\" \"Damn…\"rnMalachi said as they stepped out into the cold air of late December. As Sara,rnDerek and Chenille danced their cares into a bottle inside the booming club,rnoutside a few snowflakes were starting to fall and a cold wind was settlingrnonto the city. A odd sense of fear lingered on the cold breeze that night…nornone knows exactly where it came from, but a few knew where it was going… ","Summary":" Our Dance (Chapter 1) Sara glanced out the window of the train at the passing farmland.

Sarah just sat there looking at the ground finding her shoes interesting while Kat stood up and said \"you're the only b#$% I see around here\" pointing at him. Now that made Maliki mad. It was fist to fist. Maliki went to punch Kat when she grabbed his fist and twisted Maliki's arm around his back. Then she said, \"that's all you got?\" He moved out of the lock while putting her in it. \"I'm just starting.\" he whispered in her ear making her shiver. They pulled back where they were about 3 feet from each other (P.S. everyone is staring at them by the way) and started at each other again but when they did 2 officers intercepted them holding them back while pulling them to the office. 'Here we go again' thought Maliki and Kat at the same time. 25 min later KATS POV Four people walked in the office 2 parole officers and 2 social workers.

Do you think he was suppose to stand there and just let me hit him? Because if you did your stupider than you look.

Now you two report straight to your 6th period classes\" he let her go and the two headed to the bathrooms, of course! (Did you really expect them to head to class??) \"You save my a!! back there?\" asked Maliki \"your too fun to get rid of and ill be gone by tomorrow most likely so why should you suffer when you couldn't get revenge for it?\" answered Kat a bored/sad tone as she entered the girls bathroom. About a minute later Kat came out of a stall and then washed/dried her hands off. She looked in the mirror for a second then sighed and headed for the door but a she was almost there she was pushed to the wall of the girls bathroom. (Where else) She was starring straight at Maliki. He held her arms and had her body pined to the wall with his. \"Stay\" was all he said before claming her lips in a gentle kiss that made his every detail turn to her attention in those few seconds from his muscular chest and arms to his soft but demanding lips. When he broke the kiss all she said was \"ill sure as hell try\" and he gave her a quick peck on the cheek and left her stunned thinking about what just happened. (your lucky I love you guys so much because a was going to leave it at that part were it said (where else)... but if you think he is going to just forget all his beliefs and go all mushy you guys don't know Maliki be ready for some major twists... mua ha ha ha)) Scooby176: aw that encouraged me soo much I looked at the review over and over again why I was writing and I started writing it once I got it! p.s. nice chapter my review thingy is being mean again TheAngryPrincess13 : Oh yeah I loved your review so much I showed it to my mom and I'm not letting her see the story because if I did my ass would be in so much trouble!!![Chapter 5] Disclaimer:i dont own any movies Im so sorry for not updating sooner i luv y'all and hope you are still reading my story i hope you like it. shout out to two of my favorete readers if your still reading this TheAngryPrincess13 and Scooby176 next chapter shold be about malakis point of veiw (POV) ok on with the story! Kats day Kat finaly got to class and finished school not even remembering what her last class was. she was day dreaming all though class. After school She was talking with Snoky, Sarah, Chenile, Derek,and a couple other people outside the school when they asked her about Stepps. \"Yo, Kat there is this club down town called Stepps and you know its kinda members only but if you want we could hook you up\" Chenile asked smoothly \"Im in so what do I need to do\" \" YOU need to give ME 20 dollars for idinificatiom\" said snoky first pointing to her then to himself with his usual cockyness \" YOU need to stop saying big words before YOUR head explods, and I already have a id\" said Kat doing the same thing making fun of him and sticking her toung out. \"Girl you better stick that toung back in that mouth before I bite it off\" he retorted \"You wouldn't\" \"Try me\" finished with a smirk as Kat playfully hit him on the arm. Chenile laughed and asked \"Hey can i se your id\" \"Sure\" Kat handed her id to her and Sarah \"This is good it looks exactly like you\" comented Sara \"Who did it\" \"A old friend I knew before my parents died he..\" Kat was cut off by a guy no older than 27 coming up to her. \"Hey you Kat Jays new kid\" he asked in a rude tone of voice \"Whos askin'.\" \"Im supose to pick you up from school\" he said impatiantly looking at the road and then her \"come on\" \"whats your name.\" He hesitated for a second \"Ben\" \"Well Ben, I will only go with Jay and nobody else so I'll walk home before I go with you a'ight\" \"Kid i was told to get you and your gonna come with me..\" he growled out \"Or what im at a school for cring out load there are security gards at the doors\" she pointed to the doors where four cops were watching everything \"So if Jay wants to pick me up from school he can do it himself.\" The guy left muttering something about teenagers \"Kinda harsh don't ya think?\" Derek said \"Well, I don't trust people too easy and he was actin' kinda weird\" she said like it was the most obvious thing in the world \"Oh yeah he also would have said something about me gitting in trouble today\" \"Oook\" snoky said blandly \"So we all goin' to Stepps tomarow\" a choris of voices said stuff like 'yeah' 'I am' 'I cant' came from the group. Finally Kat saw Jay a guy who looked about 28/31 mabe \"Gotta go I'll catcha later\" Kat said happily walking to Jay \"Sup papi?\" \"You make me feel like a old man\" \"Thats because you are\" \"Dont push it you are already in enough trouble\" he said while puting he bag in the backseat of the car.

Check yeah L8r, Luke ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own save the last dance or any movie Sorry this first chappie is short but I ju"},{"Movie":"Save the Last Dance","Title":"Threatened Dancer","Author":"Shooting Jewel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/570901","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Threatened Dancer This, as the title shows, is a dance story, but I'll explain all thendance terms, so people who don't know anything about it can (hopefully!)nenjoy it, too. But if there's anything you don't understand, e-mail me andnI will answer all your questions. It's especially meant for people who havenseen the movie 'Save the last Dance'. Please tell me what you think of thenfirst chapter of my first story. Sarah strained to keep the difficult position she was in, with her armsnraised gracefully over her head to the ceiling of the dance studio, and onenof her legs lifted out in an attitude position (when the leg is firstnstretched straight behind the body and then bent at the knee so the foot isnas high as, and parallel to, the hips) and her whole weight on the tips ofnher toes of her other leg. She threatened to wobble, and shifted her weightnmore over her supporting leg, until she was so straight she looked like anstatue that had been carved in that position and would never move. Sarah loved moments like this, when she could stand on one leg withoutnholding on to anything, ignoring the wisps of dark blond hair which hadnescaped from the tight knot she had fashioned at the back of her head. Then she heard the clack of the dance teacher's high shoes as she camentowards the girl. 'Very beautiful, Sarah. Come and see, class. Look at the perfect waynSarah holds her body over her foot and how she raises her arms in angraceful oval just in front of her head.' The teacher, Miss Levine, smiled at Sarah, pleased with her progress.n'And your leg forms a nice line there. Keep up the good work!' Flushed with success, Sarah lowered her leg and went down from her toes.nShe was sweating with exhaustion, but it was definitely worth it. It wasn'tnoften that a pupil of the Julliard School of Fine Arts was praised withnsuch enthusiasm. The competition was fierce, and if a student behavednbadly, was absent or late for a few lessons, or didn't fulfill thenstandards of the school talent-wise, they were kicked out. A lot of youngndancers had been dismissed in the first few weeks of school. But Sarahnwasn't among them. Her talent was growing, as was her confidence in beingnable to succeed, and she was judged one of the best of the fifty femalendancers in the Junior class. Meanwhile, Miss Levine was correcting other girls in the class: 'No,nRuth, you aren't right up on your toes. You will never get it right if youndon't change that. Amy, that leg is better than it was before, but the kneenstill isn't high enough. Oh, Jane, will you never get that balance?! You'venbeen working on it for weeks now!' she exclaimed exasperatedly as shenstruggled to get Jane, a tall, thin girl with wide dark eyes and ash-brownnhair, into the right position. Sarah turned around and looked down the barre (wooden bar that runsnalong a wall in dance studios; dancers support themselves on it to getntheir balance and posture right) to see if anyone was as good, or better,nas her. Ruth, who stood directly behind her, was trying with an agitatednexpression on her face to lift her entire weight on the tips of her toes.nAs Sarah looked her over, she shook her head. Ruth was hopeless. Her reddish brown hair was tucked up in a messy knot,nher skinny, stick-like arms were held in a stiff, unnatural-looking way,nwhen the aim was to make them look smooth and flowing, and her frowningnblue-grey eyes looked too big for her thin, pale face. She was neither angood dancer nor a pretty one. Amy, who was next in line, was pretty, very pretty. She had platinumnblond hair, sparkling violet blue eyes and a nice, slim figure that had angraceful look to it. Sarah sighed defeatedly. She could never look asnbeautiful as Amy. But, in fact, Sarah was even more beautiful than Amy. Shenpossessed flowing, dark blond hair with bits of gold glimmering in it whennthe light touched it, and clear, long-lashed blue-green eyes that capturednpeople's attention at first sight. Her waist was slimmer than Amy's, andnher smile had an exotic flair to it. But in Sarah's critical eyes, shenlooked like a dead leaf in comparison to Amy's blossom-like appearance. Inna little rush of triumph, she did note that Amy had been criticised oftenntoday by Miss Levine, and right now, her back was not straight as it shouldnbe, but crooked. At least she could dance better than Amy, she thought withna little bit of consolation. Dark-eyed Jane was of course still struggling with her attitude (seenabove), and even though she had managed to slip through the first harshnweeks of the demanding classes, Sarah was sure she wouldn't be here muchnlonger. Sarah's eyes softened as she turned them to the next person in line,nEllie. Ellie was her room-mate, and the two teenagers had become friendsnquite soon. Ellie, tucking back a bit of her shiny black hair, looked up to catchnSarah's eye and smiled in her shy, friendly way. She was one of the mostngraceful and expressional dancer of the class, but she lost hope easily andncouldn't jump very high or far. Sarah worked with her at the technicalnpoints of dance, and in return, Ellie taught her the Chinese way ofnexpressing herself through movement, which she had been taught where shencame from. Ellie didn't regard herself as pretty, but Sarah knew Ellie's small andnslim form was beautiful even when she wasn't dancing. The happy smile leftnSarah's face as she heard a bossy whisper that carried across the room: 'You're not doing it right, Ellie. Your leg hangs behind you so you looknlike a scarecrow. Maybe you should eat a little less. I've got a great booknon extreme diets I can lend you if you need it.' Poor Ellie went pink in the face and straightened her leg with ferocity,nblinking back tears from her glassy eyes. Sarah's eyes hardened like steelnas she met the gaze of the culprit. Sandra, the girl least liked by all the dancers, tossed back her headnand looked at Sarah with fake innocence. Her light blue eyes stared in mocknpity at Ellie's efforts and she laughed a tinny laugh, smoothing one of thengolden curls that she had pulled out from her knot to dangle by the side ofnher face. Sarah glared at her with loathing. How dare she insult poor Ellie, who, despite her slimness, alwaysnthought she was too fat! And it wasn't like Sandra had the perfect dancer'snbody, either. Her figure was too voluptuous and her feet were too big. Evennthough she had a pretty face and lovely hair, she wasn't really beautiful.nShe lacked something for true beauty, something that Ellie did have! But in Sandra's opinion, she was the best, the most beautiful, the mostntalented, the most attractive to boys… She was the worst show-off on earth. 'All right, girls. Come into the center, please!' the dance instructorncalled out and the students left the barre (see above) and headed to thenmiddle of the room. When Sarah looked at Ellie again, she suddenly stopped short and gazednin bewilderment at her friend. Ellie's cheek-bones showed clearly throughnher skin, more clearly than before, and her arms were even bonier than theynhad been. Her eyes looked big and tired, and dark circles had formed undernthem. What was Ellie doing to herself? All of a sudden, Sarah remembered how often her room-mate had skippednlunch, saying she wasn't hungry, how often all she had for supper was annapple, and how often she disappeared into the fitness-room of the dancenschool. Ellie was dieting! And she was so thin already! Sarah realized withna start what could happen to Ellie. She could get anorexia, and what wouldnshe do then? If she didn't eat anything, she could die! The next time Sarah turned to Sandra, her eyes were burning with hatred.nBut she also felt a deep sense of guilt. How long had Ellie been doingnthis?! And she, who was supposed to be her friend, hadn't noticed a thing! This is all my fault, she thought miserably. And Sandra's! If Sandranhadn't kept on saying mean things to Ellie, maybe she wouldn't be in thisnmess now! As the music started for their floor exercises, Sarah squared hernshoulders and decided with unwavering confidence that she would talk tonEllie after class. She had to save her friend![Chapter 2] For Love In this chapter, which is the sequel to `Threatened Dancer', Sarah is still fighting to get her friend Ellie to her senses, while at the same time she is trying to cope with not having seen Derek for a long time. It is different from my other chapter because it is written from Sarah's POV. Thank you for the reviews I have received and I hope to hear more of your opinions, especially from people who have enjoyed the movie `Save the Last Dance' or from people who dance, too. `Ellie, wait up!' I called out as soon as our early morning ballet class ended. My friend and room-mate was heading for the stairway to the first floor. Running, I caught up with her and turned her around so that she was facing me. Her face still showed the pain she had felt at the mean remark about her that Sandra had voiced during the class. And I could also see frustration and a bitter determination in her pretty, almond-shaped eyes. `What on earth have you been doing?' I demanded of her. `Look at yourself! You're as thin as a stick, that isn't going to help you dance!' To emphasize my words, I reached out my fingers and pointed to her clearly showing cheek bones, to her bony shoulders, and to her horribly skinny waist. It maid me sick just looking at it. `Sarah, I am not skinny! I am fat, why else would I dance so badly?! You're just being nice to me, because you're my friend!' Ellie burst out, the tears that flowed so easily now filling up her glassy eyes. `Your weight has nothing to do with your dancing ability, trust me! If you would only relax, and not be so afraid of making mistakes and letting all your feelings out, you would make so much more progress. Just dance, Ellie, that's your dream, isn't it? Just dance, and don't care about what anyone says! Dance to free yourself from all your problems, to be in perfect harmony with the ever-spinning world, feel yourself leaving the earth, to soar with the winds...' I broke off, caught in a drift of remembrance of the person who had told me those exact same words, when I had left for the Julliard School. Derek. He had taken me aside before I stepped into my dad's car and had looked at me with those sensitive, steady eyes. `Sarah,' he had said in a low voice so my dad couldn't hear. `At the school, there will be lots of people who want to be professional dancers. Some will be your friends, some will be your enemies. But don't wrap yourself up in hate. It will show in your dancing. Love and you will shine like a star when you dance.' I had smiled in spite of my tears at having to leave him. `I think I'll start with loving you, it's the easiest,' I had teased. He had grinned, flashing his white teeth at me in that sweet way he had. Then I had promised: `I've gotta come and see you again sometime soon. I don't care if I have to sneak out in the middle of the night to see you. Honestly, I wouldn't be able to survive even one month without seeing you, and the Christmas holidays are still three months away (A/N: Sarah is starting the first semester at the Julliard so it's September)!' One last desperate kiss, the last time for weeks that I would feel the safeness and security of his arms around me and his lips on mine, and I had had to leave. Remembering this scene with a spasm of longing, I remembered guiltily that I had not kept my promise: I had been at the school for over two months, and with all the training and late night working, I barely even had the time to phone Derek once every two weeks, let alone think of arranging to meet somewhere. Meanwhile, Ellie turned away from me with a little gasp, as if she were in pain, and whispered in a defeated little voice: `But I can't. Every time I try, I see Sandra staring at my body in disgust and her smirking at me, and I just fail...' She dashed down the hallway and disappeared up the stairs. That night, I avoided our room because I wanted to tell Derek about what Ellie was doing. Surely he could think of something to help her. I wandered out into the garden that was attached to the school and started walking down the path, kicking piles of brightly colored leaves out of my way. The moon was already rising, creating a sliver of pale light in the night sky. It reminded me of my mother- how, before she had died, she had told me stories about the moon; about its ever-changing shape, and about the magical power it held. I felt very alone, without my mother, Dad, Derek, or Ellie. I knew I had chosen that they weren't here with me now (except for my mother, of course), but I wished I would have been able to compromise more with my career and my friends and family. `Sarah! Over here!' With a start, I turned, yanked out of my thoughts by the voice. A dark figure crept out of a near-by bush. I couldn't believe my eyes- it was Steve, one of Derek's best buddies! (A/N: Steve isn't from the movie, I made him up myself, but Sarah knows him really well) Laughing with surprise and disbelief, I threw my arms around him in an exuberant hug. `Steve! What the hell are you doing here?' I giggled as I gave him high fives. `Kidnapping you, what else would I be doing at some stuck-up ballet school?' Steve grinned because he knew it annoyed me when my friends insulted Julliard. `At least the average I.Q. in there is up to normal,' I replied fiercely, knowing he didn't care a thing about smartness. `But wait- sorry, you probably didn't understand that sentence. After all, `average' has three syllables.' I shrugged and then laughed again when he started. `But honestly, why are you kidnapping me? Turned criminal in my absence?' I questioned, hoping he would give me a serious answer. Steve stopped laughing and looked at me with accusation in his eyes. `Derek's missing you like crazy, man. He's really worried because you sound so stressed on the phone, and he hasn't heard from you for a long time.' My worst fears had been confirmed. Suddenly feeling helpless and unfaithful, I protested: `That's not true! I phoned him... just a little more than two weeks ago... anyway, I was going to phone him tonight, but you showed up...' I trailed off miserably, feeling more than ever that I had deserted everybody who ever meant something to me. Steve had been watching me struggling with a slight amusement in his face. `Look, what are you standing here talking to me, come with me and you can tell Derek yourself,' he told me smilingly. `What? Come with you? Where are you going?' I asked, feeling a little ray of hope at being able to convince Derek that I still loved him. `You sound like an idiot. We're going to Steps; there's a real party going on there, even though I don't know why. But Derek's no fun when you're gone, so I went to get you. Whaddya say?' Steve looked at me expectantly. I felt trapped. Leaving the school at night was strictly against the rules, but I couldn't disappoint all my friends, especially Derek. Uncertainly, I glanced around at the school building behind me. Would anyone notice if I went just for a few hours? Ellie would, but she would cover up for me. Nobody checked our rooms, so wasn't there more than a fifty-fifty chance that my disappearance would go unnoticed? I really did want to be a dancer, and I was willing to make sacrifices, but what if Derek left me? To go on without him was impossible, I was sure of that. My decision finally made, I turned back to Steve with an excited grin on my face. `All right, you win. Let's go have some fun for a change!' I know this is a very short chapter, but I hope I can make the next one longer. I'm planning to write another story on the Redwall books, so watch out for it! S.J. 6[Chapter 3] A night out This chapter is still from Sarah's POV, please review and tell me if younwant it to stay that way or not. In this chapter there is no ballet ( I cannhear all of you sighing with relief), but just a little bit of swearing.nOh, and thanks for the reviews I got, most of them were pretty nice. Sarahndiscovers something most unpleasant… My breath caught in my throat as I walked into the colourful lights, thennoise of laughter, screaming, and talking, and, most important of all, thenthumping beat of the music in Steppes. Caught by this glaring scene, myneyes shone and I felt like throwing myself into the crowd of dancingnpeople, to be connected with them by the relentless beat and melody of thenmusic. But my sense overruled this urge, and I pushed my way through the crowdnwith Steve behind me, to reach the table at which Chenille and her friendsnalways sat. I felt as if I had been living in a cocoon and had justndiscovered how to free myself from it. Suddenly I stopped short. I had caught sight of Chenille, sipping at herndrink and staring with unseeing eyes at the mass of people dancing on thenfloor. Remembering everything Chenille and I had ever done together, I feltna pang of loneliness. True, Chenille could never replace Ellie, who knewnwhat I was talking about when I talked about ballet or contemporary dancen(like modern dance, only more difficult and acrobatical), but then, Elliencould never replace Chenille, the person who had helped me through thosenfirst days at the new school, when I had not known anybody, and who hadnintroduced me to her brother Derek. All this time I had been away, I hadnnot really missed her, but now, seeing her again, knowing I could hang outnwith her again, just made me realize how much I really had missed her. 'Chenille! You still know me?' I called out to her, feeling more at homenthan ever in here. She blinked, came out of her trance, and saw me. Then, her face splitninto a huge grin, and her dark eyes danced with excitement and happiness. 'Oh my gawd, Sarah! I can't believe you are actually here!' She jumpednup and hugged me enthusiastically. For all my troubles, I decided, hugging Chenille as hard as I could, Inwould have the best time here. As long as she was here, anything would gonright. I thought. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ I quickly explained to Chenille why I was here, still looking aroundnanxiously for Derek. 'Good work, Steve,' Chenille congratulated him. 'It was about time we got to see you again!' she laughed, throwing backnher short hair. I looked at her admiringly. She always looked absolutelynperfect, and still gave you that reckless, mischievous impression. Thatnbright red mini dress she was wearing lit up her impressive figure and herndark skin. I, on the other hand, was just wearing a bright blue blouse with shortnsleeves, and my jeans. I hadn't bothered to put anything special; I hadnjust left with Steve right away. Now, looking around at all the girls withntheir short tops and skirts, I wished I was wearing something else.nFortunately for me, Chenille had taught me how to alter my clothing to suitnSteppes. 'Oh, Chenille? Come with me to the washroom?' I asked Chenille, hopingnshe would get what I meant and would have some accessories for me. To my relief, she grinned at me. 'Okay, I'll see what I can do,' she replied slyly. ^^^^^^^^^^»»»«««^^^^^^^^^^^^ The washroom was overcrowded with girls applying make-up to theirnalready heavily made up faces, styling their hair, and, mostly, slippingnlittle pills or packets of coloured powder to other girls, and tucking thenbills they received in exchange away. The air stunk of sweat, deodorant,nand cheap make-up, and there was a constant lull of voices going round,nwith the occasional scream or loud laughter. I stepped in front of a cracked full-length mirror, and, unbuttoning mynblouse, tied the two halves together right above my stomach. That would donfor my top. Chenille had been watching me approvingly. Like magic, shenproduced a silver glittery belt to pep up my jeans and her make-up bag.nSmiling my gratitude at her, I began putting it on, while she swept my hairnon to the top of my head, and pinned it up. I could tell it was going tonlook great. At this point, one of the girls in the washroom approached us and askedncasually: 'You want to have a bit of sunshine?' We both knew she was offering us ecstasy, something we both kept awaynfrom. Not taking my eyes off the mirror, I kept my voice levelled as Inrefused: 'Get lost.' The girl turned to Chenille, offering her a white pill with a Smileynimprinted on it. 'It's only ten dollars for one. You won't get a better deal aroundnhere.' The girl was obviously intent on selling her drugs. That was when Chenille lost her cool: 'Look, lady, I don't know whoninvited you to join us. Keep your ass away from here, cause we ain't nonjunkies.' The girl's face darkened, but she stalked off on her high heels, leavingnus alone. Chenille turned to me: 'Are you done? Then let's get out of here. IfnDerek weren't here, I'd get downright scared.' The mentioning of Derek's name reminded me of the real reason I wasnhere. Suddenly I was excited and eager to explore the dance floor. 'Come on, let's go find your brother dear,' I told her as we left thenwashroom together, never noticing the black looks being shot at our backs. ^^^^^^^^^^^^»»»«««^^^^^^^^^^ The infectious rhythm went right to my legs, making me want to forgetnabout everything but to move to the music. But my desire to see Derek wasneven greater. Chenille had gone off to find Steve, and I was scanning thenmass of dancers for the familiar sight of his face. With a rush of triumph and longing, I saw him, his eyes laughing intonthe face of everybody who would dare try to take away his happiness. Justnthe sight of that made me stop the hurried dash for him that I had wantednto do. I felt blunt confusion, darkened with suspicion and hurt. Why was henenjoying himself so much? Didn't he miss me at all? How could he dancenwithout being reminded of me? And then, my dizzied senses caught it. The explanation for everything.nThe only logical thing, once you came to think about it. He was dancing innthe arms of another girl. How stupid of me not to think of that! I thoughtnthat I had toughened up after my mother's death, but no, I was apparentlynstill the same dumb, naïve little girl that believed in nothing but dreamsnand fantasies. I waited impatiently for me to get mad at myself, for always trustingneverybody too much. But instead of reproach, frustration and anger, I feltnsomething else: Despair. In one big lurch, all my logical thoughts werenshattered by this powerful feeling, which didn't only control my heart, butnalso my thoughts. Suddenly I knew I wasn't the same empty-headed, smart-nalecky person as everybody else here. They were all on the surface, yourntypical picture of the average teenager. I went beyond that. I didn't wantnto be different, but I was. This horrible, sick, crazy feeling boilingninside me was anything but the normal, annoyed, jealous emotions a girl mynage usually had when she found out her boyfriend was dating somebody else.nI felt like a little two year-old, lost and cold in a busy winter street,nbeing numbed by the cold, wiping its nose on its sleeve, howling for itsnmother, who would not come… The same feeling of helplessness raged inside me, threatening to comenout at any moment. As if suddenly commanded, I turned on my heels and racednto the exit, blindingly pushing away people who didn't matter anyway, withnonly one thought on my mind: I'm going to kill myself. So, what do you think? Don't worry, I WILL NOT make this a horrible,nbloody suicide. Please review, even if you think it's dumb, because if Indon't know what I'm doing wrong, I won't change it, right? And please tellnme if you think I put to much detail in it, or if you dance, too! ShootingnJewel[Chapter 4] Burning up inside Still from Sara's POV. If you want one from another perspective, just tellnme in your review, and I'll see what I can do without messing up my plot.nThe same goes for any other suggestions! I know the title of this chapternis screwed; I hope it won't influence the rest of the story! ************************** I walked about feverishly, looking for something - anything - to do. Butnwhat could I? I only knew I wanted to leave this world, full of hate,nbetrayal, and always having to fight for whatever you wanted; always havingnto hurt somebody else to do something you wanted to, or to have fun. Inmyself was the best example for it: I wanted my mom to come to thenaudition, and she got killed in a car accident. Derek had told me it wasn'tnmy fault, but why should I believe anything he said? He didn't care aboutndoing anything that interfered with his having fun. He was actuallynincredibly selfish, come to think of it. But I couldn't fool myself. Here I was, thinking rationally about him beingnselfish, and all the time I felt sick enough to throw up, even too sick tonthrow up. And yet, I wanted to - I wanted to do something. Usually when Ingot mad, I swore, shouted, or snapped at whoever had hurt me, or even hitnout at them. But this time, none of these things would come close tonexpressing the fever inside me, to somehow cool it down so it wouldn't burnnme up with it. I tore around frantically, stray wisps of hair flying against my forehead,nmy arms wrapped tightly around my waist as if I was cold, when I felt as ifnall the ice in the world wouldn't cool me down. With a surge of disgust, Indug my fingernails into my rib-cage, punishing myself silently for all thenstupid things I had ever done. I hated this body. Always disobeying mynwill, fit for nothing, and apparently not even good enough to hold a guy'snattention for more than a year. As for dancing - what thumping music mynsenses could pick up from the outside world, when they were all focused onnmy hated inner self, seemed to mock, instead of inspire me to dance.nVaguely I felt each beat seeming to strike me with dull pain. Now the fire inside me was boiling over. I clawed frantically at myself, asnif trying to stop it from doing anything to me, while all the while almostnrunning now with painful energy. Hot, salty tears started to pour down myncheeks, but I barely felt them; I had only started crying to let out thenheat in me. My shoes hit the ground harder and harder, pounding out mynunbearably hot energy. In desperation, my clouded eyes searched franticallynfor anything else I could do. By now I was screaming inside, and racing around in circles so fast mynvision was just brief glimpses of the different pictures. When I saw a carnnoisily rumbling along the dark road beside me, it was as if someone hadnsuddenly told me what to do. An immense relief swept over me and, spurrednon by the insane, white-hot energy burning inside me, I dashed to thenstreet and leaped in front of the car. For a split second, the headlights blinded me, then- suddenly, the heat wasnforcefully knocked out of me, and I lay still, and cold, completely atnrest. ************************** Okay, I know, short chapter and incredibly stupid place to stop, but Inwanted to bring this out really soon, so that I could work on my othernstory, and I wanted to try my hand at a cliff-hanger (haha). Sorry if it'sna little depressing, but I was feeling pretty low just now. I'll cheer upnif I get reviews for this, though! *hint, hint* Shooting Jewel[Chapter 5] Injured in Heart and Body Yet another of my infamously dumb titles. Oh well, nothing to be done aboutnthat. Thank you to everybody who has reviewed on this; and, as you wish,nSara will NOT DIE *cheers loudly*. Even though I have not been told tonchange the POV, I'll change it slightly in bits. After all, we must knownwhat Derek is thinking, mustn't we?! ******************* Sara could not see anything, even though she was sure she had her eyesnopen. There wasn't even blackness, just nothingness, as if her sense ofnseeing did not exist. She felt as if she was drifting on a tidal wave,nswaying back and forth, never getting anywhere, and always ending up in thensame spot she had started from. It was peaceful, but oddly frustrating. Suddenly she felt something soft close to her eye area. Surprised, shentried to open her eyes, and was rewarded by a little slit of light whichncoloured her nothingness for a second, then it diminished. Strange, she hadnthought she had her eyes open, but obviously she didn't, and it seemed verynhard to lift her lids. The next time she strained to see something, a flash of light and a warmnbrown face seeped through the thick layers of nothingness and swayingnfeelings to what had to be her brain. Somehow, she associated that face with something, a hazy, flimsy picturenfloating beside her on another wave; she knew it was there, but she couldnonly catch glimpses of it in the water, and never quite reach it or see allnof it. A girl - a dark hand at the side of her face - trust and hope pouring fromnher eyes - a boy's face, shining with confidence and love - and it wasngone, as quickly as it had come. Intrigued by the new discovery, she summoned up enough energy to tug hernheavy eyelids open fully. The wall facing her was white, with health posters stuck on in places. Thenlighting was brighter than she liked, not being fully used to thenbrightness after her hazy nothingness. And sitting on a stool beside thenbed she was in, was Derek. ************************** The first emotion she felt was irony. Really, it was terribly ironic. Herenwas Derek, with all the right emotions of fear, concern, and relief thatnshe was awake and conscious showing blandly on his face. If it had been anynother accident (for now she remembered everything and had guessed she wasnin the hospital and why), she would have been grateful beyond belief thatnhe was there when she woke up. If it had been any other accident . . . But it hadn't been. Derek had been the reason why the accident hadnoccurred. Dully, she noticed a throbbing pain in her knee. Great, this would probablyntake her out of classes for at least a month. If she hadn't been kicked outnfor running away in the middle of the night, that was. She had risked all this to see Derek for a few hours. And this was what itnhad come to. And now, after betraying her and causing her to injure herselfnand her chances of a career, Derek actually had the audacity to stand atnher sick bed and look concerned like your typical guy in a romance novel! The thought made her angry, seething, venomous. She wouldn't let Derek trynto come up with a good excuse; she just didn't want anything more to donwith him. Derek's eyes locked with hers as he softly asked: 'Sara?' Sara, existing only of the rage inside her, was past feeling anything atnthe tenderness in his voice. She focused on him with a deliberate starenand, finding that her voice wasn't husky or scratchy, issued the commandnthat was keeping her strong: 'Go away, Derek.' (A/N: Should I stop here as a cliffhanger, or write on? Hmmm - toughndecision. But then, the last chapter was so short already, I really can'tnafford to make this one short, too, without getting scorched with flames.nSo, here's another scene or two, from Derek's POV this time!) ************************* Derek's eyes glinted as his hopes rose. He was sure he had seen Sara'sneyelids flicker slightly. Gently taking his hand from the side of her facenwhere he had put it before, he gazed at her, waiting for another sign ofnlife. Sara's eyes opened and closed another time. Grateful beyond recognition, Derek bent over her. He had been waiting fornthis all night. And what a night it had been! First of all, there was the stress of the Steps' Dance Competition - hisndance partner, Mandy, had been terribly nervous because the prize moneynwould pay for her to take a hair-dressing apprenticeship (her dream fornlife, though Derek couldn't see why, but then, he couldn't see a lot ofnstuff about Mandy). But then, shortly after they had finished their dance, a man had comenrunning into Steps to phone an ambulance, saying his car had hit a girl onnthe road. When they had all come out to investigate, he had suddenly heardnChenille's scream: 'My God, it's Sara!' At first he'd thought she'd made a mistake. What would Sara be doing out onnthe road next to Steps? Julliard was pretty far away, and that's where henhad thought she was. Then came the shock of actually seeing her on the ground. It was Sara, nondoubt about it, but her beautiful eyes were closed, and her fancily done-nup hair was tousled and dirty from lying on the wet road. Her slightlyntanned skin looked an unhealthy green under the street-lamp. He could remember the details painfully clearly. How he'd run forward asnfast as he could and gathered her carefully up into his arms. How there hadnbeen a swelling bump on her forehead where it had hit the windshield, andnas he gently moved her, he noticed her left leg sticking out at an oddnangle. How the ambulance had come and the men had taken her out of hisncradling arms. How, driven by fear and panic, he had ridden to the hospitalnin the police car that had arrived shortly afterwards. How he had beennsitting by her bed since 11:00 p.m. when they had arrived till - glancingnat his watch he saw it was four in the morning - now. Sara opened her eyes again, and this time they focused on him. Relieved,nDerek stretched out a hand towards her. 'Sara,' he said hoarsely, wanting to have the words to explain to her whatnagony he had been through, thinking about her broken leg, wondering whennshe would be able to dance again. Suddenly, Sara's eyes turned cold and imperious. After having tested if her voice still functioned, she turned to hisnconfused face; his eyes still searching hers for trust or love. Why werenthey so hard and unemotional? 'Go away, Derek,' she told him firmly. ************************** A young black nurse who had been looking through some papers at a desk innthe hospital room looked up at Derek, still staring unbelievingly at thenone girl he had thought understood him totally. 'If Miss Sara doesn't want to see you, maybe you'd better go. She'snprobably very tired and exhausted, and you must be, too, staying at her bednall night.' the nurse told him gently. At the mention of him staying by her side all night, something flickerednthrough Sara's stony features. Confusion, maybe? Derek turned to her, his brows knit together in hurt disbelief. ' Why, Sara? What's the matter?' he asked simply. Sara rolled her eyes as if he was being tiresome. 'Look, I don't want to hear any of your pathetic excuses. Just get out ofnmy sight, for good, okay? It would be very much appreciated.' she told himnimpatiently in a sarcastic voice. 'What?! Now I'm totally confused! What are you accusing me of?' he asked,nperplexed. Sara closed her eyes. 'I'm sleeping,' she announced loudly. After gazing at her with both annoyance and dismay, Derek, shrugging,nturned around and walked out of the room. ************************ After he had gone, Sara's strong wall of anger crumbled. She tried to staynangry at him, but found that she couldn't. She had wanted him to staynthere; wanted him to explain to her, but he had gone. Feeling the familiar symptoms coming, she turned around with her back tonthe nurse. There she broke down and only with great effort could keep hernuneven sobbing quiet so nobody would hear. **************************** Well, I guess this turned out sadder than I thought. By the way, have younall figured out the girl dancing with Derek and her relationship to him? Ifnnot, don't worry, I'll explain it more clearly later. Sorry, but frankly,nthere are too much reviews to thank you all singly, but, believe me, I amnreally grateful to each and every one of you!!! And don't worry, I am NOTngoing to break Sara and Derek up for good, I wouldn't be that cruel! Well,nmaybe I would. *j/k* Can't wait for more reviews! S.J.[Chapter 6] Priorities come first I really hate myself; this is the third time I've done a dumb title! *hitsnher head on the table* Oh, well. This is another chapter from not onlynSara's and Derek's POV, but also Chenille's, since she's been left out toonmuch lately. Also, this should be a longer chapter, and maybe even anhappier one . . . ********************* Derek fumbled for his keys in his pocket, yanked them out and entered hisnhouse. Glancing around, he saw Chenille asleep on the sofa, still dressednin her Steps outfit, with her blanket lying half on her, half on the floor. Gently he reached over and covered her again. As soon as he did, Chenille'sneyelids flew up and she sat up quickly. 'How's Sara?' she said, by way of greeting. Derek left her and went into the kitchen to get a drink, so she wouldn'tnsee his face. Why did she have to talk about this right now, when he firstnwanted to go over it in his head? 'Conscious, and pretty much OK,' he called from the kitchen, attempting ancheerful voice. Behind him, he heard footsteps, announcing Chenille's arrival. 'What do you mean, 'pretty much OK'?' she asked suspiciously, wondering whynDerek didn't turn around to face her. 'Well, her knee is sprained pretty badly, and her hip is twisted, ornsomething. She won't be able to do ballet for at least a month, and thennshe'll have to build all her muscle and endurance strength all over again.nMaybe she can't afford it at this stage, I don't know,' he said, voicingnpart of his lesser worries. 'Didn't you talk to her?' Chenille pestered. 'I thought you said she wasnconscious.' 'Yeah, but I had to leave pretty soon, because the nurse said I might upsetnher, or something,' he answered lightly. At this, Chenille laughed, making him even more miserable. 'Upset her?nShe'd give the earth to see you the first time she woke up after beingnknocked unconscious,' she announced. 'Well, or at least risk the dangers ofnbeing caught out of bed at night in that school of hers.' Derek suddenly remembered something he had wanted to ask her. 'What wasnSara doing outside of the club anyway? Why would she come there?' Chenille rolled her eyes. 'You could pass off as the stupidest person onnthe whole damn planet, Derek. The answer to that is YOU!' This caught Derek entirely off guard. 'Me?' he asked in disbelief. Howncould that be, when she had basically just kicked him out of the hospital? 'The one and only,' Chenille grinned at her brother and stalked out of thenkitchen, leaving Derek in a state of utter confusion. *************************************** 'Sara?' Sara, feeling very exhausted now she had stopped crying, turned aroundnreluctantly, wondering tiredly why they didn't just leave her alone. A doctor was sitting on a chair beside her bed - the same chair Derek hadnsat in, Sara noticed with a little wince of pain. 'OK, Sara, how about you tell us what happened. We got a report from thenpolice about the accident, but there are still some unclear bits in it. Asnwell,' he added, looking at her intensely, 'we've received a phone callnfrom the Julliard School of Arts, about a missing student - you, we'renguessing.' Sara thought over what he had said, wondering how much of the truth shenshould tell. The doctor eyed her sharply, and when she didn't say anything, hencontinued. 'Let's start with the Julliard School. Are you a pupil there?' Sarah looked sullen. I was, but now I'll probably get kicked out, shenthought glumly. However, she decided she didn't have enough energy to bendefiant, and answered obediently: 'Yes, I take dance there.' The doctor looked slightly alarmed. 'Professionally?' he asked herncarefully. 'Of course', was Sara's response. 'Well . . .' the doctor hesitated, obviously unsure what to tell her.n'Estimated, it will take up to four months for you to get into a physicalncondition in which you can take on the daily professional lessons such asnJulliard requires you to. I'd have to ask a physician, but I don't know ifnthis means you will have to give up your chance of a dance career.' 'What?' Sara was shocked. 'What's wrong with me?' she asked defiantly. 'Your knee isn't really the problem, it's just sprained, which will onlynlast a few weeks. But your hip - at first we thought it was only twisted,nbut unfortunately, it's not. There is serious damage to your hip bone, andnit will take a very long time for you to recover.' The doctor finished hisngrave speech. Then he switched over to a brisker tone. 'So, what were you doing out onnthe street when you should have been safe in your school?' Sara shrugged, still trying to cope with the news that she was threatened,nonce again, to stop dancing as a professional. What else could she do withnher life? It would suddenly turn dull and grey, with all hints of thenshining colours that had filled it a day ago gone. 'I was so bored,' she finally said, coming up with an excuse. 'I wanted tonget out, so I just strolled around the city. Then I noticed how late itnwas, and started to run back, so I didn't notice the car coming . . .'shendrifted off, and looked at him expectantly. Would he buy the story? He frowned. 'Alone in the city at night?' he asked her incredulously. Sara gulped. Damn it, I didn't consider that, she thought, searchingnfrantically for an excuse. When she didn't find one, she resolved to tellnhim part of the truth. 'You win', she told him sullenly. 'OK, here's what really happened: I wasnout in the park late in the evening, and some of my friends came along, andnwe went out to a club. From then on, it's pretty much the same. I noticednthe time, and ran as quickly as I could. Then you know what happened.' The doctor smiled briefly, but then his face returned to looking serious.n'Well, Sara, maybe next time you should consider where your prioritiesnlie', he informed her, getting up. Sara gazed at his back as he left the room. Her priorities . . . They hadnalways been dancing and her mum, till she died, and then she hadn't had anynpriorities for a while, and then it had been Chenille and Derek, and thenndancing again . . . and now, it seemed as though she had no priorities atnall in her life. Except - 'Chenille!' she suddenly whispered, excited. Surely her best friend couldnhelp her out! Hope flooding through her, she turned to the nurse at thendesk. 'Excuse me, did you find my cell phone? I had it with me when the carnhit me.' The nurse smiled. Reaching over, she handed Sara her cell phone. 'Do younwant to make a call?' she asked the invalid. Sara just nodded; she wasnalready dialling Chenille's phone number. ************************************* Chenille was in the middle of feeding little Christopher his breakfast. 'Come on, honey. Just eat one more spoonful for mommy, okay? I'm stressednout as it is; I don't need no more trouble than Sara's already giving me,nbeing in the hospital', she added resentfully. When her cell phone rang, she threw up her hands in defeat. 'I give up!nThere is no way I can hope to relax a little today!' Dropping her son's spoon in his bowl and wiping his mouth with a napkin,nChenille jumped up and, after some difficulty, found her phone still in herncoat pocket. 'Hello?' she said ungraciously. 'Hi, it's me, Sara. I'm really feeling -' But she was interrupted by Chenille's excited scream. 'Oh, I am so gladnit's you who called! And you'd better be, too, cos I would have stranglednanybody except you just now.' she concluded savagely. 'Why? What's up at your house?' Sara's voice sounded wistful even throughnthe phone. She's probably bored to death, Chenille thought with sympathy.nBeing stuck in a hospital room can't be much fun. Out loud she announcedndisdainfully: 'What can you expect? Just your typical day trying to copenwith infuriating Derek and annoying Christopher. Believe me, your betternoff in that hospital, girl.' A sigh from Sara was transmitted over the line. When she spoke again, hernvoice sounded hesitant, trying to be casual but definitely waiting to hearnsomething important. 'Did Derek - say - anything? When he came home? About,nuh, me, maybe?' Chenille was mystified, and her voice showed it. 'Whatcha mean, did he talknabout you? As if I would let him get away with not giving me the news!nBesides, he often talks about you, I don't see why this morning should havenbeen different.' She paused, waiting for an explanation. What was Sarangetting at? 'Oh, Chenille, I missed you so much. I mean, sure I have friends at thenballet school but they're all so uptight. You're the only one I can come tonwith my problems now, and I need you to talk to right now. Can you come?'nSara sounded pleading. Detecting the urgency in her voice, Chenille didn't hesitate. 'Be rightnwith you. Just let me finish feeding Christopher and I'll be on my way. Uh,nSara? Is this anything Derek should know about? I mean, should I tell himnanything particular?' She waited expectantly. Now she would know if allnthis had anything to do with her brother. 'No, he doesn't need to hear any of this. He already knows it all.' Sara'snvoice was suddenly bitter. Chenille took a deep breath and addressed Sara again in a curt tone: 'Don'tnworry, I'll be right there.' After Sara had thanked her and said good-bye, Chenille wandered over tonChristopher, who was attempting to eat his spoon. 'Sara's got herself intondeep trouble now,' she muttered under her breath, hoping that her suspicionnwouldn't prove correct. ****************** Meanwhile, Derek had the music on in his room, but he wasn't listening tonit. What could he have done to Sara that she would treat him this way?nAfter all, he himself had been getting really depressed that she had notntried to see him sooner. And Chenille had said she had come to the club tonsee HIM. Then why - Suddenly he jumped back with a groan and slapped himself on the foreheadnwith his palm. The dance competition!!! How could he have been so stupid?!nHow could she, as a matter of fact? Derek stood up and started pacing the room, the answer coming clearer tonhim with every step. Sara had obviously left the dance school to see him.nShe wouldn't have known that the competition was on that night, how couldnshe have? She had probably come into Steps, looked for him, and spotted himnat the exact moment when he was dancing with Mandy! And it hadn't beenntimid dancing either, they had both laid it on thick for such an importantncontest. But Sara, completely oblivious to this fact, would have beennhorrified, run out, and - Derek stopped suddenly. Tried to kill herself?! Was it possible that shenloved him that much? Or was it just an accident that she hadn't noticed thencar in her distress? Only one thing was clear: He had to see her as soon as possible andnEXPLAIN. Without a second thought, he grabbed his jacket and left for thenhospital. ************************** Sooo . . . what do you think? I'm sure all you smart, intelligent peoplenknow EXACTLY what's going to happen, so it's not really a cliffhanger,nright? *hopes desperately for no flames* I love all the reviews I got,nthey're really what's keeping this story alive. I mean, I write it, but younguys motivate me so I can't leave it alone anymore! And you are welcome tontrash the story in your reviews, I won't mind! (Well, actually I will, butnthat's beside the point. What I really mean is: review, please!) Shooting Jewel[Chapter 7] Bear it together This is the next chapter for Threatened Dancer, which I have FINALLYncompleted! You don't know how difficult it is for time-stressed me tonhandle three stories at the same time. I know I sound really wimpy to allnyou people who have ten or more stories out, but as I said, I'm time-nstressed. Enough excuses, let's get on with the story! This will be anbitter-sweet chapter (provided the characters do what I want them to andndon't go wandering off somewhere on their own), sad but happy at the samentime. See for yourself: ******************************* 'Ok, shoot. What's so urgently wrong?' Chenille flopped down on the chairnbeside Sara's bed and glanced at the invalid expectantly. Sara looked at her friend dully. 'Nothing, except that Derek's beenncheating on me, is acting all innocent, and that I've sent him to hell.' Chenille drew her breath in sharply. 'God, you don't believe in staying outnof trouble, do you?' she exclaimed. 'How did Derek cheat on you anyway?'nshe added, curious. Sara sighed. 'He was dancing with another girl when I saw him in Steps thennight I sneaked out - to see him . . .' she trailed off miserably. 'Just dancing?' Chenille asked suspiciously. 'Or bad dancing? You gottanknow the difference.' 'I do!' Sara said vehemently. 'And it was pretty heavy, by anyone'snstandards.' 'Well, I don't know what was going on, really. But I can't really believenthat Derek would do a thing like that. I mean, he loves you like crazy, andnhe doesn't mind waiting for you so you can go after your dreams. Sure henloves to dance, but I can't see him cheating on you to dance with anotherngirl.' Chenille stopped abruptly, and looked defiantly at Sara, defendingnher brother. Sara moaned. 'Oh, don't you turn against me, too! The whole world isnagainst me! First Derek, then I won't be able to dance for months, so Inmight have to give it all up, and now you lecture me, too!' Chenille sat still for a minute, torn between sympathy for her friend andnloyalty to Derek, then reached over and hugged Sara tightly. 'Don't worry,' she whispered soothingly in her ear, 'no matter whatnhappens, you won't have to face it alone. Even if Derek and your mothernwon't be here for you, I will.' Tears slid down Sara's cheeks, as she clung to her friend desperately. At that moment, both girls heard the sound of a door being thrown open andnslammed shut again. When they looked up in shock, there stood Derek in thenroom, his brown eyes full of compassion and understanding. ****************************** Even though she had been crying, Sara managed to resume her dignity. 'Don't remember asking you to come, Derek', she said coolly. Chenille stoodnup and slipped away quietly, not wanting to disturb them in their talk. Derek didn't even notice. 'Sara', he spoke earnestly. 'You saw me dancingnwith Mandy, didn't you? Was that what was wrong?' Nonchalantly, Sara shrugged her shoulders. 'So that was her name. You'llnhave to introduce her to me sometime.' she told him sarcastically. But Derek wasn't put off. 'Sara, how could you have thought I had anythingnto do with that girl? She was my dance partner, for heaven's sakes!' 'So I noticed.' Sara interrupted harshly. 'No! Not the way you think! There was a competition for the best dancers innSteps, and we had to do it with partners, so I took her because she's andecent dancer; that's all, I swear it!' He gazed at her levelly, willingnher to believe what he was saying. She gazed at him in disbelief, but then shook her head stonily. 'That'snimpressive, Derek, I'd give that excuse an eight out of ten, but you'llnhave to try a little harder to make it sound realistic.' Derek frowned at her. 'What's wrong with you?' he demanded. 'I've told younthe truth. Why won't you believe me?' 'I guess I've just been hurt one too many times', Sara replied sharply,nrefusing to let him try to convince her. 'Now, we've been through all ofnthis before; I believe now the part comes where I say 'piss off', butncorrect me if I'm wrong.' Derek glared at her. His gentleness was gone, and he felt only anger andnfrustration. 'Well, maybe you wouldn't get hurt so much if you trusted people a littlenmore!' he snapped at her. She simply raised her eyebrows. 'My 'piss off' line is coming', she warnednhim. Suddenly, Derek felt only annoyance towards the sarcastic girl lying in thenhospital bed. 'Oh, by the way, thanks for visiting me so often after vowingnyou'd sooner run away than not see me for a month!' he snarled before hencould stop himself. The instant he did, a change came over Sara. She stared at him, wide- eyed,na look of immense horror and guilt on her face, as she whispered: 'I triedn. . .' Then she broke down completely, and was sobbing unrestrainedly, shakingnwith bottled-up pain and agony. All of Derek's bitterness was washed away, and the sweet tenderness he hadnfelt before any time he was with Sara returned. Carefully, gently, he movednover to her bed, sat down on it, and wrapped her in his arms. Sara gasped with surprise and new hope, and clung to him wildly, cryingninto his shoulder. Time seemed to stop as the two sat, clasping each othernin their arms in an endless embrace, all sins forgiven and forgotten, andnonly the strong love that bound them in their hearts. They both felt as ifnthe last weeks had been a hazy nightmare, and not a moment had passed sincenthey had held each other the last time. 'I'm so sorry,' Sara whispered in a shaky voice. He leaned down and softlynput his lips on hers, as if telling her she needn't apologize for anythingnshe had done. Sara's heart leaped. In a lightning flash, she felt that surging feelingnshe had whenever he kissed her; a feeling she had almost forgotten andnhadn't thought she would ever feel again. She grasped Derek tighter andnkissed him back passionately, as if she thought that if she ever let go,ntheir happiness would break and be lost forever. Derek held her to him, his mouth never leaving hers, feeling only completenhappiness and excitement at kissing HER again, the girl he had missed withnmore longing than he had known till now. Now was all that mattered. Now henwas together with her, their dark and pale skin forming an intricatenpattern. Any suffering that had occurred in the past was made up for withnthis moment. And anything that would happen in the future was only anshadow, one that they would live through and bear together. Only he didn't know exactly how strong they would have to be to bear thenfuture, even together. *********************** Chenille quietly opened the door, crept into the room, and slammed it shut.nGrinning, she watched Derek's and Sara's reactions: Both jumped and whippedntheir anxious faces around towards her. When they saw her, both of themnlooked furious for having been interrupted. Chenille laughed out loud innamusement. 'It is NOT funny, Chenille!' Sara cried out, blushing. But then shenlaughed, too, relieved of her worst worries and united with her friends. Chenille crossed the room quickly and joined the couple. 'When's thenwedding?' she asked brightly. Derek widened his eyes in mock astonishment. 'It was five minutes ago, howncould you have missed it?' While Sara burst out laughing, Chenille smacked her brother across the headngood-naturedly. 'You know?' she suddenly said. 'It seems just like the old days, with allnof us hanging out together and having fun.' 'The difference', Derek remarked, 'is that we're 'hanging out' in anhospital room and Sara can't move.' Chenille shrugged. 'Didn't seem like that a second ago', she put in slyly.n'I was going to tell you to be a little careful of her, but I'm guessingnshe didn't mind.' The pair grinned secretively at one another, but didn't say a word. Theyndidn't have to. Suddenly, the door opened again, and the doctor Sara recognized from beforenentered. He stopped short at seeing Chenille and Derek, but then continuednwalking towards her. 'Hallo, Sara. I see you have some visitors.' he said, glancing at hernmeaningfully. Sara looked resolute. 'Yes, as a matter of a fact, I do. They're mynfriends.' she added defiantly. The doctor nodded warily. 'May I speak to you in private, Sara?' he askednher cautiously. 'About what?' she demanded suspiciously. The doctor sighed. 'Your current state of health', he told her. 'And someninformation I got from the physician at Julliard's', he added deliberately. Sara looked pale, but composed. 'You can tell me outright', she informednhim calmly. 'I'd tell my friends anyway.' 'Very well, but don't say I didn't warn you', he said gravely. 'Is it that bad news?' Derek asked anxiously. The doctor didn't answer right away. He pulled up a chair and sat facingnthe little group; Derek and Chenille sitting on either side of Sara, as ifnto strengthen her. 'Yes', he finally said. 'It is that bad news. I've talked with thenphysician and your teachers, Sara, and, from what I can gather, it will notnonly take several months for the hip injury to heal, but also another monthnfor you to gradually work your way up to the level of expectation atnJulliard's classes again. You'll miss the Christmas exams, for sure, andnyou might not even have enough time to build up the strength for the springnexams. Either way, you'll miss a year of training, and it's doubtful if younwill be able to complete your Julliard training when you are young enough.nSoon you'll be too old to join a troupe.' The room was quiet. Chenille was watching the doctor with a look of horrornand dislike, Derek looked stricken, and Sara seemed to have gone into antrance, disengaging herself from the rest of the world. Finally the doctor spoke again. 'I'm sorry, Sara', he said gently. 'But wencan't help you in any way. I'll look into it some more, but frankly - itnlooks like you're going to have to look at an alternative career.' Withnthat, he stood up and left, leaving three hearts broken. ****************** Sara heard his footsteps fading away, brisk and business-like. She herselfnwas shocked into numbness, and for a fleeting moment, she felt as helplessnand betrayed as when she had seen Derek dancing with Mandy, and thendestructive flame blazed up inside her, stifling her with its heat. But then she felt a cool hand on hers, and the flame flickered and went outninside her. The numbness hung heavy on her like a cloud of rain, but shendidn't feel the suicidal urge as she had a moment ago. 'Sara', Derek said softly. 'Don't worry. No matter what happens, I will benbehind you. Forever.' Sara turned to him, her pain reflected in his eyes. She pulled her face inna grimace like a smile, and told him with great effort: 'Not behind me.nWITH me, Derek.' 'Me, too.' Chenille put in quickly. 'I'll do whatever I can to help you,ngirl.' As Sara gazed at them, feeling surged back into her; pain, agony, andndisappointment, but feeling none the less. She grasped Derek's andnChenille's hands in hers, and silently thanked them for the strength thatnwas pouring into her. SHE would not give up without a fight! ***************** Hmmmm . . . interesting chapter. Sorry for all this tragedy, but hey, whatnwould be the point in writing if everything was perfect? Of course, thisnwill have a happy end (as I am a great believer in totally happy ends), butnthere is some trouble before that. Oh, come on, let's look on the brightnside! Our dream pair is together again! *cheers loudly yelling at the topnof her lungs* Well, see you on the next chapter, or when you review (haha,nas if anyone in the world would review on this boring, sentimental chapter!nNice joke, Shooting Jewel)! S.J.[Chapter 8] The Choice I've decided that I'll wind this story up soon, so don't expect too manynchapters after this. It's gonna end pretty soon, and, as I said before,nhappily. Sooo. this is the beginning of the end. ****************************** Sara flipped through a dance magazine glumly. Chenille and Derek hadngone, and she was not only bored, but also feeling flat. After all, if shencouldn't dance, then what? Everything would be unbearable without dance.nThat was what lifted her up into the clouds of heaven, when she felt atnabsolute peace with herself and the world. Almost like when Derek held her. She was jerked back to reality by the arrival of a group of doctorsnand nurses. She recognized the one as a famous specialist. Against hernwill, bubbles of hope rose up inside her. Could he do anything for her? 'Miss Sara, as you might know, I am Dr. Stirn. I heard of yournpredicament, and I was very sorry to. It is always the greatest sorrow whennthe person afflicted would have a career like yours in front of them.' I know all that, Sara thought impatiently. What she said was: 'So,nwhy are you here?' The doctor's grave eyes became even more solemn. 'Though undernordinary treatment, nothing can be done for you, there is a specialnoperation that could fix your leg in time to build up enough strength tonattend your regular classes, and take the spring exams.' At the sight of Sara's joyful face, he smiled grimly. 'But what younmust understand is that this operation is very risky, and that if it fails,nyour leg will be in a worse condition than before. In short, you would bencrippled for life.' he added bluntly. Shock and frustration swept through Sara, but she forced herself tonkeep a calm face. 'What are my chances of the operation going well?' she asked, tryingnvaliantly to stop the tremble in her voice. 'Almost exactly fifty-fifty', Dr. Stirn answered. 'It is, of course,nyour decision, but remember the risk before you make it.' With these words,nhe left a very troubled Sara to her worries. ********************** 'Derek! Derek! Sara phoned!' Derek, having just come in after taking Christopher for a walk, wasnassaulted by the very excited Chenille, who came tearing through the livingnroom. 'What?' he asked tiredly. He really had no wish to have to deal withnhis sister in this mood now. 'Derek! Listen to what I'm saying! Sara phoned, and there's annoperation that could be done on her leg, which would make it better in timenfor her to attend Julliard classes, so she could still dancenprofessionally!' Derek had to process this information first. Then he stared atnChenille in amazement. 'You really mean it?' His sister's face became sombre. 'Yeah, that's what she said. Butnthere's also this risk that the leg could be deformed or something, sonshe'd be crippled.' The sudden happiness that had flooded Derek's soul drained out of himnas quickly as it had come. His throat tightened, and he didn't trustnhimself to speak. His darling, beautiful Sara, so strong, but yet so vulnerable, wasnput before this horrible choice. Closing his eyes, he could still see her,nher face earnest in concentration, her limbs lifting gracefully as shendanced. She could lose all that in one miserable strike of fate, and hencould do nothing about it. Wordlessly, he brushed by Chenille, who turned on him angrily. 'Don'tnyou have ANYTHING to say?' Derek sighed heavily. 'I wouldn't know what,' he answered her. **************************** The kindly nurse came briskly into Sara's room, carrying a pile ofnmagazines, which she dropped on the invalid's night-table. Sara glanced over without much interest, having lost all thatnanimated her. She just felt dull, as if nothing could satisfy her. And whynshould she care? Even if she died, it wouldn't make any difference. Maybenit would be better to die than to go through the agony of living, but notndancing. 'They're some old dance magazines I found in the lobby,' the nurseninformed her cheerfully. 'I thought you might like them.' Sara thanked her monotonously. Because the nurse didn't leave rightnaway, and because she really didn't want to hurt her feelings, shenlistlessly picked up the first magazine and opened it up at a random page.nHer eyes swept dismissively over it, and then focused sharply on a picture;na picture that produced a vivid memory in her mind. It displayed a pair of feet, beautiful, strong feet, but disfigurednwith countless blisters, some of them bleeding openly. Blue veins stuck upnunder the pale skin, and calluses had formed on the toes. Next to thesenfeet lay a pair of pointe shoes (A/N: some people call them toe shoes, justnso that you know; they're used so you can dance on the tip of your toes),nwhich were scarred and battered. The pink satin was almost faded to grey,nand dark streaks covered a good part of them. (A/N: Flashback)n Gingerly, she removed her softened pointe shoes. She had beennpracticing at home for over an hour, and her feet throbbed with burningnpain. She saw she had another blister on her left foot. It had burst opennand was raw and bleeding. She closed her eyes in defeat. She still couldn'tnget the pirouettes (A/N: turn around oneself on one foot) right, but hernfeet ached too much for her to continue practicing. Then her mother cameninto the room and sat down beside her, smiling the warm smile she knew sonwell. 'Oh, Sara, what's the matter?' she asked the twelve-year-old girlnsoothingly. Tears flooded from her eyes as she leant against her mother. 'It hurts SO MUCH!' she sobbed. 'It's like my feet are on fire!' 'Let me tell you a story, Sara,' her mum said, stroking herndaughter's hair comfortingly. (A/N: this story is real, I just exaggeratednit a little to make my point) 'There used to be a young ballet dancer named Margot Fonteyn. She hadna beautiful presence, and could express everything she wanted to on stage.nBut her feet were the wrong kind for ballet. She danced for years and yearsnin intolerable pain. But she wouldn't give up, and became the principalndancer of a famous ballet company when she was only fourteen. When MargotnFonteyn was dancing, everybody had to look at her. Nobody would havenguessed that each performance caused her great agony because of her feet.nThen, a new kind of pointe shoe was brought out that suited her feet muchnbetter. She could now dance as freely as she had always wanted to. Margotndied in 1991, and became a legend of unsurpassable beauty and grace.' Her tears had dried as she listened attentively to the story. 'Andnthe moral of that story is?' she asked her mother. 'Never give up on your dreams, and it will pay off for you in thenend. In short: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.' Her mother smiled at herndaughter affectionately. 'And that is what you must always remember, Sara.' As the memory faded, a feeling of calm came over Sara. She had been ancoward to forget her mother's words, but she wouldn't any longer. Her chinnshot up in calm defiance. She had made her choice. ************************** Sorry for the absolutely shortest chapter in the universe, but that seemedna good place to stop, don't you think so? *giggles mischievously and ducksnto avoid getting flamed* But it's kind of obvious what she's going to donnow, sooo. see ya next chapter! Thank you, my faithful reviewers (death to everyone else, *j/k*) HAA,nMarsMoonStar, and *cuty-cat*[Chapter 9] Fated Well, this is just about the last chapter. I've totally loved writing thisnfic, cause I was inspired by the movie 'Save the last Dance' and cause Inadore ballet myself. I've really enjoyed hearing from all my reviewers, andnthough I can't promise I'll write something more about a topic that younlike, I'll still be grateful if you stay to the end of this story and seenhow it all turns out. I didn't actually mean to make it so short, but thisnjust seems like the right place to end it, once and for all. ******************** Sara looked over rather tiredly at the door which had just opened,nbut smiled gratefully when she saw who had come. 'Derek!' she exclaimed happily. She was resting, and lookednbeautifully calm, as if all the fear had gone out of her and she had givennher heavy burden to fate. Derek's eyes burned at the injustice of seeing her, who had sufferednso much, tortured even more. She was evidently worn out, but stillnexpressed gratitude and rapture for him. He walked gently over to her andnsat down on the bed, taking her slim, pale hand in his. 'So tell me,' he urged her softly. 'What did you decide?' Sara's eyes seemed to see right through him for a second, thennfocused back on his face. They were lit up by some magical secret only shenknew. 'I'll do the operation,' she said simply. 'It wouldn't be right tonshrink from what could open up the door that has been slammed in my face.' 'And what if it doesn't work?' Derek asked anxiously. His eyes probedninto hers, and he found fear in them- but only a little. Her serenity morenthan made up for it. 'Wouldn't you just be getting your hopes up toonearly?' At that, the fear took over. 'Aren't you behind me?' she demanded,nwide-eyed. Instead of answering, he leaned down and kissed her lips so lightlynthat he hardly so much as brushed them, but the love that blossomed upninside her banished her fears immediately. 'When will they operate on you?' Derek changed the subject.n 'This afternoon. It will take a few hours, but I should know bynevening.' Seeing the worried look in his eyes, Sara told him confidently:n'Don't worry, I'll phone you the second I get hold of the news.' He shook his head. 'Chenille and I will be waiting outside.' Sara gasped. 'During the whole of the operation?' Derek looked slightly bewildered. 'Of course,' he answered. 'What didnyou expect?' She leaned back on her pillow and closed her eyes. A radiance hungnabout her, as around one who has just received enlightenment. Derek got up quietly, and gazed at her in silence. Her long goldennhair lay silkily on the white pillow, as did her eyelashes on her cheeks.nThe hands he had always admired were folded over her chest. The picture wasnone of a goddess; one that would stay in his memory forever. He suddenly knew that no matter what happened, Sara would acceptnit. And as long as she did, he would, too. *********************** Sara glanced at the clock and calculated. She still had about tennminutes before the operation was to start, but it would take five minutesnto transport her to the surgery room. That left her with five free minutes. She did not even have to think of how to spend the last bit of time.nChecking that the nurse was gone, and that no one could see her in any way,nshe sat up and pulled off her sheets. Then, gritting her teeth against the pain, she swung first hernhealthy, and then her injured leg over the edge of the bed. Steadyingnherself on her bed, she got up. That was the easy part. Taking a deep breath, Sara tested her weight on her damaged leg. Asnimmediate pain shot through her, she lifted it up again quickly. Defeated, she sank back on the bed. 'There's NO WAY I can do this!'nshe muttered angrily. Yet somehow she knew that she had to. Just this onenlast time. Dance. Dance till the end of her freedom. Dance till the time whennher fate would be decided. She knew she could never stand it if that balletnclass at Julliard's had been the last time she would ever dance. She wouldnnot let it happen. Dance. Dance. Dance. Dance. The rhythm pulsed through her entirenbody, waking her sleeping limbs and muscles. Dance. Dance. Dance. A divine, unearthly strength filled her, opening her eyes wide. Asngracefully as if she were a butterfly rising into the air she liftednherself off the bed. She was dressed in the simple shirt and shorts that served as pyjamasnat the hospital. But to her, the room evaporated. In its place, there wasnnot the ballet studio of the Julliard, not the living room in her old homenwhere she had practiced long and hard for so many hours, not anywhere elsenshe had ever danced. It was just her and the rhythm inside her, from thenmoment she first pointed her feet and lifted her arms to an oval over hernhead. There was no pain. There was no feeling except the blood rushingnthrough her, supplying the endless strength she was receiving fromnsomewhere beyond our world. Arabesque, attitude, pirouette, petit tours. Everything came back tonher with no difficulties, and her body obeyed her commands before she evennthought of them. The movements swirled into an intricate pattern. Dance. Dance. Dance. Dance. Gradually the rhythm grew fainter, andnleft her. The godly strength slipped away from her. She did not try to holdnit back. She knew she couldn't. And then she was back in the hospital room. Wearily she felt her hot,ntear-streaked face. Her damaged hip hurt unbearably. But it had been worthnit. Exhausted, she dropped back on the bed. Hearing footsteps down thenhall, she hastily pulled the covers back over herself. Nobody should knownshe had been out of bed. As the doctors entered the room and were busy lifting her onto a bednon rolls, she was in a triumphant daze. Even if she died now, or wasncrippled, it didn't matter. She had had her life down to the last gloriousndetail. And she could still feel the seraphic glory that had been hers fornthose last five minutes. On an impulsion, she lifted her eyes to the ceiling. Now she couldnhand herself over to fate. Now she was ready. *************** 'How is she?' Chenille asked her brother, who was just coming intonthe waiting room, anxiously. He looked at her steadily. 'Very calm and composed,' he informed her. 'How can she?' Chenille was mystified. 'I mean, there's her wholenprofession on the line! I know I'd be just about crazy by now if it wasnme.' Derek shrugged. 'She has an unbending strength somewhere inside her.nI guess she needs it, because of what happened to her mother and all.' They sat in silence for awhile. Suddenly Chenille clasped her hands. 'It's starting now!' she exclaimed wildly. 'I never pray, but now InHAVE to!' Derek smiled slightly. Maybe his sister felt the need to pray, but henwould just keep faith with Sara as best he could. Just imagine he wasnholding her hand now. People hurried by the two teenagers, both with their heads bent innsolemn spirits, and both trying to believe as hard as they could thatneverything would be alright. ******************** 'Sara. Sara, wake up.' A familiar voice was coaxing her out of the hazy fog that surroundednher. Blindly, she followed, for even in her state she could tell that itnwas a voice to be trusted. And suddenly she found she could open her eyes. Derek's tired facenwas illuminated with the light of the reborn. 'Sara, thank goodness you're awake! The operation was successful!' henshouted happily. Right behind him was her best friend, Chenille, squealing withnexcitement. 'It's true! You'll be able to dance again in time to do itnprofessionally!' 'No way. It can't be. can it?' Sara was trying to figure everythingnout, and could not grasp that the miracle had happened. Suddenly, Dr. Stirn appeared, smiling benevolently. 'Yes, it's true, Sara. You will be able to recover in time to attendnJulliard classes and go in for the spring exams with excellent chances.nFrom the medical point of view, there will be no obstacles for anprofessional career. But no more night-time wandering, okay?' He winked atnher. Lots of people have said that the truth is hard and bitter, but atnthat moment Sara thought there was nothing more glorious and beautiful thannthe shining truth. EVERYTHING was going to be alright. She hugged Derek andnChenille close to her and laughed with a relief she had not felt possible.nThe world was hers to conquer once more. And, once more, she felt that divine strength flooding her again,njust for a second. Sara registered it with gratitude. She was sure that itnhad been that strength, and Derek and Chenille's trust and love, that hadnsaved her. Dr. Stirn had one more warning: 'I know you're over the moon withnhappiness now, but just remember that it's going to be hard to work up tonJulliard's standards again. I don't know how good a dancer you were before,nbut it will take some time till you're that good again, believe me.' Sara simply laughed. She felt invincible. Still holding Derek andnChenille tight, she assured the doctor: 'THAT won't be a problem.' And as soon as she felt Derek's kiss once again, she knew thatnnothing that could happen would be this bad. Because she would have Derek'snlove forever and ever. (A/N: The end of the story? No, there's still one little bit. Enjoy!) ******************** Five years later, the same Sara was nervously testing her balance onnher pointes. She was fully made up, and was dressed in her costume already.nIt was hot and stuffy in the wings of the stage. Who would have ever thought that it was me who would be picked tondance the principal role in Swan Lake, she wondered. Her first solo in thenAmerican Ballet Company. Stretching her legs on the barre that had been put up behind thenstage, she grinned excitedly at Ellie, who smiled back, happiness dancingnin her eyes. Ellie had realized her eating disorder, and had gone to anclinic to get help. But she had still been able to dance, and had made itnto the company, just like Sara. She was dancing in the corps de balletn(A/N: the main body of dancers in a ballet company, who usually dancentogether in a group). Suddenly, she was interrupted while warming up. 'Miss Sara, someonento see you,' a stage assistant was saying, but Sara didn't even hear. Fornthere he was, beaming at her. 'Derek!' Disregarding her make-up and delicate costume, she threw hernarms around him. He held her close, and she could feel that heavenlynfeeling soaring up inside her. Derek had come to see her dance! 'Miss Sara, you're on in one minute', another assistant informed her.nShe simply nodded, and clung to Derek passionately- or, as best she couldnin her tutu (A/N: dancer's skirt that is usually made out of layers ofntulle). 'Look at where you are now!' he whispered in her ear. 'Principalndancer of the American Ballet!' 'Look at you!' she retorted, smiling proudly. 'A bachelor ofnmedicine!' He winked happily. 'Now go out there and show me your love,' hengrinned at her. 'No problem,' Sara said, her eyes dancing. 'When you're watching me,nI dance like I'm Margot Fonteyn (A/N: She was the dancer in the story hernmother told her when she was twelve)!' 'No,' he replied, affection shimmering in his eyes. 'You dancenbetter.' A hasty kiss, and Sara was at the edge of the stage, waiting for herncue. When it came, she ran gracefully out onto the stage, aware thatnDerek's eyes were on her. And she danced. She danced for Derek, for her mother, for Chenille,nfor Ellie, for her dad, and for everyone who had ever believed in her,nSara, as a dancer. THE END OMG, that was so heart-breaking to write, cause it was the last chapter.nSorry that it was so short after all the really short chapters you've hadnto bear. Oh, well, can't be helped. Anyway, I'd appreciate a review for thenend of the story, just telling me what you thought of my ending or what younwould have changed. I cleared up Ellie, so that's not on your minds. It'snfunny, when I started writing this I never thought it would turn out likenTHIS. So weird! Well, hope you all liked it anyway. Thanks to everybody who ever reviewed and especially to those that havenbeen with this story for a long time and have reviewed often (HAA, megs,nDanielle, Amy Czislowski, CurlyQ, MarsMoonStar, chosen_gurli)!

Dear God, I started my newnproject to look for you today. I went to my Dad today and asked menwhat he thought of you. I figured that since he Knew about deathn(since we're around it so much.) that he had to believe innsomething. He said that he and my Uncle Phil used to go to Sundaynschool all the time when they were younger. But even though he wentnto church it was a long time ago and he wasn't to sure if he knewnthat there even was a God. For some reason I felt bad for him. Next,nI went to Shelly. She told me that she believed in God and thatnbefore she got a divorce from her first husband that she used to gonto a small Baptist church. She said that she would like to find a newnhome church and all of us start going on a regular basis. As anfamily. I liked that idea. Then she asked me if I would go with hernto help find the church that was right for us. She told me that shenbelieved in God and that before she got a divorce from her firstnhusband that she used to go to a small Baptist church. She said thatnshe would like to find a new home church and all of us start going onna regular basis. As a family. I liked that idea. Then shenasked me if I would go with her to help find the church that wasnright for us. It was weird; I nevernthought that looking for God could be so hard. And exhausting!!! Ohnwell, I'm going to bed. More Later, Vada.[Chapter 3] Dear God, I've been going to this new church with Shelly and Dad for a week now. It seems kind of nice but I'm not too sure if it will help me find god. It's called Grace Baptist Church. Tangie, the group leader for the Junier High crowd is very nice. I even made two new friends, Chris and Lexie. Their my age and both have my same passion for writing poems. They are both in my grade and go to my school. I hope that I see them there when school starts. So far I'm really not too sure yet that you exist. Please show me a sign some how that you do. I don't know much but I do know that in need something to believe in and I would like that to be you. Lexie says that you really do exist and you're the only reason that we are here today. I want to believe that but I need some help from you. More later, someone is at the door. I put my notebook away and went downstairs to see who was at the door. When I got there, no one was there. That's weird, could that have been a sign?[Chapter 4] Dear God, I've been going to Grace Baptist church for three weeks now. I really like it. Next week we are going on a Missions Trip to help rebuild a church that was knocked down last year by a tornado. It's a two week trip and I hope to find more clues that you really do exist. Oh, guess what! Dad is letting me have my first slumber party! I can't wait! Lexy and her sister, Anya, are staying over here tonight. It's going to be sooo much fun. Dad bought popcorn and is going to order pizza that we could eat while we are watching movies. And Shelly's going to let us do makeovers. Well I have to go so I can get ready for tonight. Love, Vada As I got the bowls out for the popcorn and candy, I heard the girls and Shelly talking. I turned and ran to the front door. Great , their here an hour too soon. A/n The next chapter will be the sleepover. If I have time it should be up in a week or two.[Chapter 5] A/n: I own nothing but the idea and Lexie. John 3:16-18 is from the Bible. Dear God, We had so much fun last night. We ate pizza and popcorn, and watched some movies. Before bed we just sat and talked. Kind of the way Thomas J and I used to talk for hours on end. I really miss him. Lexie asked me about him. It was hard to talk about him, but in a way I think that it helped me. I told her about all the things we used to do together and what he was like. And then, I told her about how he died. She told me that he must have been a great friend to sacrifice his life just so that he could find my mood ring. Then she started to tell me about your son, Jesus. At first I didn't understand. I know that he died for our sins so that we could go to heaven but couldn't there have been some other way? Well sure, there was the whole Sacrifice thing and that seemed to work for a while, but there had to have been something else. Lexie told me to read John 3:16 through 3:18. (For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son .) After I read that, I understood what Lexie meant when she said that Thomas J was like Jesus. Wow! That really is some major love. To give up your own child just so that I could go to Heaven. Thank you, God. I think that my Quest to find out if you are real is complete. Love, Vada After I put my journal away, I called Tangie. I decided that I wanted to go to heaven to be with Thomas J when I died. I wanted to see my mom, and most of all I wanted meat Jesus. a/n Well that's it. I know that it isn't too long but I have so much to do with summer coming in just a few months. If anyone has ideas for a sequel or has any questions for me, about the story or about the Lord, then you can contact me at I hope you enjoyed my story and thinks for reading it![Chapter 6]  ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do notnown anything.

With her being a tomboy, she found it hard to mix with other girls as she found most girly stuff boring and most girls irritating. Vada was out clothes shopping with her friend Judy, when they walked into a clothes shop. Judy spotted a very beautiful pink dress \"Oh my gosh, how beautiful is that dress\" shrieked Judy in a high pitched girly voice. \"Meh\" shrugged Vada \"Excuse me!\" Judy snapped \"What…?\" Vada replied \"I don't like dresses or girly things\" \"Can we go to the park and play baseball or something?\" Vada asked \"I want to get my nails painted\" Judy wined \"I'm outta here!\" Vada sighed and walked out the shop \"VADA, WHERE YA GOING!\" Judy yelled \"AWAY FROM YOU, YOU'RE BORING!\" Vada barked back. And Vada stormed home. When Vada got home, she slumped onto the couch and sighed. \"What's up Vada?\" Asked her father \"Girls are boring!\" Vada grumbled. \"All they talk about is make up, shoes and other girly stuff\" \"Look I know your still suffering inside because of the death of Thomas J\" Vada's father assured \"It's not that, it's the fact I would rather be friends with a boy than other girls\" said Vada with a sigh. \"Look I know what will cheer you up\" Vada's father smiled, putting his arm around her as to give a hug \"How about I make you a chilli for dinner yeah?\" \"Sounds good\" said Vada, trying to sound happy. And so Vada's father went to the kitchen and started making a chilli while Vada switched on the TV A few minutes later, Shelly walked into the room tidying up with the feather duster. \"How longs dinner?\" asked Vada \"Shouldn't be long sweetie, why's that?\" responded Shelly Vada's stomach roared loudly. *LRRRGG!* \"That's why\" Vada said putting her hand on her belly. A few minutes later, Vada, Shelly and Harry were sitting round the table eating chilli with rice and a side salad. After dinner, Harry let Vada walk to the shops to buy some candy for herself. So Vada walked down the street to the shops. Once Vada reached the shop, she bought herself a chocolate bar and walked home. On the way home, she decided to have a wander into Thomas J's street. Vada noticed a moving van outside the house that Thomas J lived in. His parents moved away to start a new life in Miami. There was a man and a woman who would be about Vada's father's age carrying boxes into the house. Then Vada saw at the back of the truck a young boy. He looked a bit older than Vada, but he had long blonde hair, sparkly blue eyes and wore a biker style jacket. Vada stood still, her heart pounded \"Wow…\" she thought to herself[Chapter 2] Comfort Food Chapter 2 Vada was speechless, this guy was beautiful. Just then, the long blonde haired man saw Vada and approached her. \"Hey can I help you?\" he asked. Vada's heart raced \"Hi…my friend used to live hear years ago\" she slowly said \"Oh yeah, boy who died, sorry to hear that hun\" said the man flicking his hair back \"Names Eddie, Eddie Wilson\" \"Vada, Vada Sultenfuss\" Vada and Eddie then shook hands Vada was trembling with nerves \"Your…your hair is amazing and your eyes are beautiful\" Vada stammered. \"Eddie….come help unpack\" a female voice called out \"Hey listen Vada, nice talking to you but I'm busy at the moment\" \"I will see you round soon yeah\" Eddie then smiled and walked into the house Vada walked away with her heart racing \"Wow…he is so beautiful\" she said to herself. Vada then got home and went upstairs as all this excitement made her need the bathroom. Vada then pulled down her jeans and knickers, and sat on the toilet seat. Then there was a tinkling sound as Vada was on the toilet. Then Vada farted loudly which was followed by loud splats. Shelly then knocked on the bathroom door. \"Vada sweetie, you in there?\" \"Yeah give me two seconds\" Vada called out. Vada then wiped herself, pulled her trousers and knickers up, flushed the toilet and let Shelly in. \"VADA THAT STINKS!\" Shelly gagged as Vada walked downstairs. Vada was in a good mood for the rest of the day. Later that day, Vada and her family had roast chicken with potatoes and vegetables for dinner \"Glad you cheered up\" smiled Vada's father during dinner. \"I have met this awesome new guy\" Vada happily said. \"Oh really...\" said shelly taking a bite out of her meal. \"Yeah' his name is Eddie and he lives where Thomas Jay used to live\" \"Invite him over so we can meet him\" Harry suggested. \"I will\" Vada responded, taking a bite out of her meal.[Chapter 3] Comfort Food Chapter 3 The next day, Vada went to meet Eddie to invite him to her house. She went up to Eddies house, rang the doorbell and then Eddie answered \"Oh hi Vada, what brings you here?\" said Eddie happily. \"Erm…would you like to come to my house for dinner sometime?\" Vada shyly asked. \"Course I would\" Eddie responded. Just then a smell went up Vada's nose; it was the smell of cookies. \"Are you baking cookies?\" Vada asked. \"Sure I am,\" Eddie responded \"Would you like some?\" Just then Vada's stomach gurgled loudly. *GLOOORRP!* gurgled Vada's stomach. \"Course I would\" she then giggled and Eddie let her in the house. \"My parents are out at the moment\" Eddie then led Vada into the kitchen where out of the oven on a tray, he pulled out a batch of cookies. He then handed one to Vada that was still warm. Vada then took a bite out of it. \"Oh this is delicious\" Vada said with her mouthful. Then Eddie had an idea. \"Why don't you stay for dinner tonight?\" Eddie asked Vada \"I will prepare you something\" Soon Eddie made Vada a cheeseburger and fries with a soda to drink. \"Thanks Eddie\" said Vada with her mouth full Afterwards, Vada burped. *BURRP!* \"That's cute\" Eddie chuckled Then Eddie offered Vada the tray of cookies. Vada then ate all the cookies, followed by a whole bottle of milk. Vada then burped loudly *BURRRP!* \"Look like I said, my father wants to meet you Eddie\" \"So will you come to my place sometime?\" \"Will do\" Eddie smiled[Chapter 4] Comfort Food Chapter 4 The next week, Vada invited Eddie to dinner. Harry and Shelly had set the table out all fancy with the fine china out and Shelly cooked some Pasta with cheese sauce with a side salad and garlic bread. Just then the doorbell rang. Vada went to answer the door. Vada then let Eddie in the house and brought him to the dining table. \"Dad, Shelly, this is Eddie\" Vada introduced. Harry and Shelly felt quite shocked and slightly sickened. \"Hey, pleasure to meet you\" Eddie introduced. Shelly then served up the pasta and placed the garlic bread and salad on the table. \"Is he for real?\" Harry thought to himself. After dinner, Shelly then served up a chocolate cake for pudding. Once everybody had finished pudding, Harry took Eddie into the living room while Shelly and Vada tidied up. Harry then raised an eyebrow and questioned. \"How old are you?\" \"I'm 17\" Eddie responded. \"Don't you think Vada is a bit young?\" Harry then asked. \"Age is a number\" Eddie then replied. \"As long as people are happy, it doesn't matter\" \"What planet are you on?\" Harry snorted. \"What is your problem?\" Eddie asked. \"What is a 17 year old doing with a 12 year old girl?\" \"Look, im like a big brother to her, I actually look out for her and care for her\" Eddie explained. Harry then sighed. \"Alright bub, I'll let you befriend my daughter\" \"BUT! If you step out of line and hurt her in anyway, you will regret it big time, got that!\" \"Sure thing\" Eddie then shivered[Chapter 5] Comfort Food Chapter 5 And so, Vada's and Eddie's friendship grew stronger every day. After School, Vada would visit Eddie at home where Eddie would cook for her as his parents were hardly in the house. On weekends, Eddie would take her to the park, the beach, waterparks, or anywhere for a day out. Or some days, Eddie and Vada would order a pizza and just laze about. But little did Vada know, she was slowly gaining weight. Within a month, Vada's hips had widened, her cheeks became chubbier, her belly swelled and her clothes began to shrink. But at the same time, Vada was in love with Eddie as much she was food. Whenever Vada became bored, she would have a snack. One day, Vada decided to let out her feelings, so she wrote a note and gave it to Eddie. On the note, Vada had written. \"Please meet me in the forest at 7pm tonight\" So later that night, Eddie and Vada met in the forest. \"Eddie, there is something I have been meaning to tell your for a long time\" Vada then took a deep breath. \"I love you\" Eddie was stunned. \"Gosh Vada, I love you too\" Eddie responded. And they kissed under the moonlight.[Chapter 6] Comfort Food Chapter 6 Vada soon became a binge eater. Whenever she was bored, she would grab a snack from the fridge. One day, Shelly caught Vada eating a whole tub of strawberry ice cream. Vada had gained so much weight, that her belly hung out of her t shirt and above her jeans. \"Vada don't you think you have had enough?\" Shelly asked. \"What's you point?\" Vada responded with her mouth full. Just then Shelly got angry. \"What's my point…WHATS MY POINT!\" Roared Shelly. \"LOOK AT YOURSELF!\" Vada then had the last spoonful of Ice Cream and put it in her mouth before Shelly frogmarched her to the bathroom and told her to strip to her underwear. \"Look how much weight you have gained!\" Vada looked shocked. She saw her massive belly hang over her knickers that barley fit her, her arms and legs had expanded and her cheeks became bigger as well as her chest. \"Oh my gosh…im fat!\" Vada said sounding very shocked. Vada's bottom lip trembled and then Vada began to cry. \"What have I become?\" Vada sobbed. \"Im a big fat pig\" \"Vada…I think you need help\" Said Shelly, comforting Vada. Later that night Shelly discussed what had happened to Harry. Harry was furious. \"I bet that Eddie had something to do with it\" he hissed. At the same time, Vada was with Eddie in a field. \"Eddie…I love you and everything, but since meeting you I have gained weight\" Vada sighed. \"That doesn't matter\" Eddie assured \"You're still beautiful as the day I first met you\" \"Do you want to come round my place, I'll order a pizza\" Eddie asked. Vada drooled a bit. \"Look I've got to get home\" Vada explained whipping the drool from her lips. \"I'll throw in some onion rings and a soda too with a chocolate cake\" Eddie added. Vada's stomach rumbled loudly. *RUUUMMBLE!* \"Gosh you got one loud rumbler\" Eddie chuckled. \"So…your place for food?\" Asked Vada. And they went to Eddie's house and ordered a huge Pizza, onion rings and a large soda with chocolate cake.[Chapter 7] Comfort Food Chapter 7 A few days later, Harry could take no more of seeing his daughter gain so he took matters into his own hand. First he went to Eddie's house and knocked on his door. \"Hello…anybody there\" There was no answer. Just then, Eddie came up from behind Harry. \"Can I help you?\" Eddie asked Then harry noticed Eddie had a magazine. \"What's that in your hand?\" asked Harry. \"It's a cooking magazine\" Responded Eddie \"I'm also a fan of cooking as well as music\" \"Your daughter can't get enough of my cooking\" \"You're telling me!\" Harry snorted. \"Vada has now expanded in size!\" \"BASICLY SHE IS NOW A WHALE!\" Harry then roared. \"What is your problem anyways?\" Eddie barked. \"Vada is still beautiful!\" \"In fact, she suits being big\" Then Harry's heart sank and he became angrier. \"That's it!\" Harry hissed again \"I don't want you anywhere near Vada ever again!\" \"UNDERSTAND!\" Harry roared. \"Eddie looked heartbroken\" \"But… Vada's my friend\" he then whimpered. \"GET SOME OTHER FRIENDS YOUR OWN AGE!\" Harry then yelled and stormed off back home. When Harry got home, he told Vada that she was forbidden from seeing Eddie again. Vada's heart broke and she ran to her bedroom and cried her eyes out. Later that night, Vada was so heartbroken she couldn't sleep. So she went downstairs and opened the fridge. She then poured a glass of chocolate milk for herself. Then she realised, it made her feel better So she looked into the fridge and saw a huge chocolate cake. She then ripped pieces out of it and ate it all. Then with a stuffed belly, she walked back up to bed. Then Vada became very glutinous and lazy. A week later she went to Judy's house and knocked on the door. Judy answered. \"Look I'm sorry for before, do you want to make up\" Asked Vada sounding sorry. \"Yeah…sure\" Judy stammered sounding shocked. \"She sure has put on weight\" Thought Judy to herself. \"Do you want to go to the pool later?\" Asked Judy. Vada smiled \"Sure thing\" And so, Judy and Vada were friends again and Vada stayed fat.

CHAPTER 1 \"Ms. Johnson---I can't say this on the record yet, but welcome tonJulliard.\" These words remained ringing in Sara's ears as she headed backnto the changing room with Derek explaining what the judge had said to Roy.nAs she walked out of the changing room with that uncontrollable grin on hernface, she saw Roy come running towards her \"You got in!??\" He exclaimed, so enthusiastic that his had fell off andnwith a laugh, Derek bent down and picked it up for him \"Dad, calm down---You're making a scene,\" She replied, trying to soundncasual about it all \"Hey, who cares whose watchin'! You're goin' to Julliard baby!\" Dereknexclaimed as he leaned in for an enthusiastic hug. Sara could feel the eyesnof other ballerinas waiting to audition staring at them in envy. She couldnalso see ballerinas who hadn't made it staring at her with resentment.nQuite frankly, she didn't care.n---------- As the three of them piled onto the subway and sat down, Sara realized howntired she was. She propped her head up with her fist and tried desperatelynto keep her eyes open. \"Tired?\" Derek asked \"Mmm,\" she replied \"You'll be home soon,\" he added, and nothing else was said on the ridenhome. They only heard the divine sound of silence. The next day at around noon Sara heard a knock on her door. Since hernfather was out working, as he usually was on Saturdays, it was up to her tonanswer it. The first thing she saw when she opened the door was a hugenbouquet of flowers in her face \"Congratulations Girl!\" Chenille screamed as she pushed herself in andngreeted Sara with a heart-felt hug. \"Thanks!\" She replied, still in awe as Derek walked over to her and gavenher a quiet but sweet peck on the lips while handing her the flowers. \"So I know you're goin' all fancy and shit but you still wanna hit Steppesntonight?\" Chenille asked with a smile on her face \"Yeah, of course I'll go!\" \"A'ight girl,\" She continued as a sly grin formed across her face, \"So tellnme 'bout it, what'd they say 'bout ya'?\" Sara laughed and sat down on thencouch along with Derek and Chenille \"Well he just said that I was going to Julliard,\" Sara replied casually \"How you gonna act like that Sara?\" Derek asked as he put his arm aroundnher, \"All casual and shit. You goin' to Julliard baby! You're allowed to benexcited you know!\" They all laughed \"I am! I am!\" She replied, \"I'M GOING TO JULLIARD!!!\" She yelled, \"Thatnfelt really good,\" \"So, I was talkin' with Kenney yesterday after you left the park, Derek,\"nChenille started, removing her coat and placing it over the edge of thensofa. \"He said he's gonna start comin' around more, you know- seein'nChristopher and everythin',\" \"And do you---\" Sara was searching for the right words, but realized therenwere none that could be used except the ones she wanted to say, \"Do younactually believe him?\" Sara and Derek waited for an answer, and after anlong pause Chenille answered \"I---Look, ya'll are lucky a'ight? I wish me an' Kenney could be as happynas you two are but I do love him an' I can't help it,\" \"Chenille---\" Derek started \"No, Derek!\" She exclaimed as she felt tears starting to form in her eyesnbefore she viciously wiped them away, \"I'm gonna do anythin' I can to getnhim to love me too,\" \"Chenille you don't need him,\" Derek said, placing one hand on her knee,n\"You'll find someone who'll love you back, but it ain't Kenney. He don'tnsupport Christopher, he don't visit him, he doesn't even visit you!\" \"I know Derek but that's what he was talkin' 'bout after you left. He saysnhe sorry for all that. I wanna give him one more chance an' I think hendeserves it,\" \"Will he be at Steppes tonight?\" Sara asked \"Maybe,\" Chenille replied, at that was the end of that conversation.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2 Sara looked at the two outfits on the bed in front of her, debating overnwhich one to wear to Steppes. One was a purple-blue tank top that went downnto just above her belly-button and a black leather mini-skirt. She'd wearnher hair in two French braids along with a pair of hoop earrings similar tonthe ones lent to her by Chenille on her first time at the club. The othernoutfit was a simple black halter top along with a longer skirt that thenleather one. \"Which one do you think?\" She asked Chenille, who was fixing her makeup innSara's bedroom mirror \"Hmmm .\" She replied, closing the cap to her lipstick and walking over tonthe bed where the clothes lay, \"This one's ti-ght!\" She exclaimed, innreference to the purple tank with the mini skirt. \"Really? You sure it's not too skimpy?\" \"Nah . but this one's slammin' too,\" She replied, as she packed up all ofnher makeup into her purse and walked out of Sara's room to leave. Derek wasnpatiently waiting outside of her room, waiting to take the two girls tonSteppes. \"Man, you guys almost ready? I've been waitin' here forever,\" He commented,nbefore Sara stuck her tongue out at him and closed the door. \"Derek, don't you want your girl to be lookin' hot tonight for Steppes? Angirl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do!\" She joked, as Sara came walkingnout, shutting the door behind her (Which her father iHadi actuallynfixed). Derek felt a smile creep across his face as he watched Sara walknacross to the coat-rack. \"What? You don't like it?\" She asked him. He just realized he had actuallynbeen staring at her \"No! No you look . great,\" He said, rising from her couch along withnChenille. Sara could feel her face starting to blush as Derek put his armsnaround her and kissed her lips. He started to whisper something in her ear,nbut Chenille interrupted them \"Ya'll can do that later, c'mon we're gonna be late!\"n------------ Sara, Derek and Chenille took out their I.D's and danced their way into thenclub. \"Ohhhhhh yeah!\" Chenille exclaimed as the song \"In Da Club\" by 50 Cent camenon and she headed onto the dance floor along with Derek and Sara. Once theyngot dancing they just couldn't seem to stop, until Sara could feel thenenvious eyes of Nikki on her and Derek. She mentioned it to Derek, but henjust simply shook it off \"Just ignore her,\" he said as they continued showing off their off-the-hooknhip-hop moves. Sara just couldn't stop thinking of Nikki watching themndance. Obviously she was jealous and resentful of Sara, but that wasn'tnwhat really bothered her. What bothered her was the thought of Derek beingnwith anyone but her. Trying to shake these thoughts off, Sara headed to thenwashroom to freshen up. Once she entered she realized that that was a badndecision. The first thing she saw was the back of someone's body, alongnwith long black hair. As soon as they turned around Sara wanted to run outnthere and then. \"What you doin'?\" She asked, as if she didn't know. Sara's first instinctnwas to simply ignore her . but that didn't quite work. \"When I ask younsomethin' you better answer, bitch!\" \"Look Nikki,\" Sara started, not trying to offend her- she didn't feel likengetting into a fight tonight, \"I don't want to fight with you. I'm justncoming in here to .\" Nikki didn't give her a chance to finish \"To get in my way!\" She slowly walked over to Sara until they were onlynabout an inch apart, \"Stay away from Derek,\" \"No!\" Sara replied, pushing her away. Nikki sneered and Sara decided it wasnbest to run out. Nikki followed her and literally jumped on her back andnbegan pulling on her hair. Sara screamed and shook her off, when Nikkintripped her. A crowd was now surrounding them and Sara could see Derekntrying to make his way over to see what was happening. \"Sara!\" He exclaimed before attempting to break the two up. Nikki spit onnSara, which made things worse. Derek managed to finally calm Sara down andnbring her outside and out of the club with Chenille tagging behind;nconfused. Once they were outside Derek saw the glistening red flowing downnSara's white cheek from her lip \"Damn Sara!\" He commented, heading toward his house, \"Come on over to ournhouse, we'll put somethin' on that . what happened?\" He asked, putting hisnarm tightly around her. He wanted to be angry at her for stooping tonNikki's low, but found that he couldn't. He could see the tears in Sara'sneyes and he didn't have the heard to be mad at her. \"Nikki . god that bitch! Okay, I walked into the bathroom and there she wasnsaying all this shit . and then she told be to stay away from you Derek sonI pushed her and then everything started and .\" She continued, wiping thentears from her eyes. She could hear the pitter-patter of feet behind her,nwhich appeared to be running toward them. \"That's it, go ahead and cry bitch!\" Nikki yelled, stomping toward them,n\"It ain't over,\" Derek walked toward her but stopped before getting toonclose to her \"Stay AWAY from me Nikki,\" he said coldly, \"Jus' cause you got DUMPED bynthat dude doesn't mean you gotta come crawlin' back to me. Just stay thenhell away from me AND Sara,\" \"She don't love you like I do Derek!\" Nikki screamed. This time Derek andnSara just ignored her and, eventually she left.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 By the time they all got back to Derek and Chenille's house, Sara was aboutnready to collapse. Her lip was stinging like crazy and she could feel anbruise forming on her right cheek. She could also feel a little bit ofnblood trickling out from a cut made by Nikki's nails on her arm. With his arm around her, Derek led Sara into the small duplex-like place hencalled home. \"Here, go lie down there,\" he suggested, pointing to the couch, \"I'm gonna'nget some ice for that. Chenille will stay here with you,\" he finished withna smile and a kiss on the top of her head. Sara laid her head down on anbeige pillow on the couch and stretched out. Chenille took her coat fromnher and then sat down on the other couch next to Sara's. \"You a'ight'?\" She asked, closing her eyes for a moment and then openingnthem again in the direction of Sara, waiting for an answer \"Yeah I'll be okay,\" she replied, touching her hand to her lip where thencut was. She could still taste and feel blood, so she knew it hadn'tnstopped bleeding. Once Derek entered the room once more, Sara sat upnwaiting for the cold ice to be pressed against her bleeding cut. \"This's gonna sting,\" he warned, pressing it against the cut. Sara flinchednat first but tried to bare the pain. \"It's a'ight, its ai'ght,\" Derek said,ncalming her down a little. Chenille got up from the couch and walked overnin the direction of her bedroom. \"Ya'll are fine right? I gotta get some sleep,\" \"Yeah you can go,\" Derek said, holding the ice on Sara's lip, \"good night.\" \"'Night. . . 'night Sara,\" \"'Night,\" she replied, attempting to form a small ounce of a smile on hernpaining face, but Derek told her not to. \"Just hold that on there,\" he told her, as Sara took hold of the freezingnice and lay her head down. Derek took her legs and put them over his. Saranclosed her eyes and grunted from the severe pain. \"So. . . you know Nikkinand me . . . there's nothin' between us anymore,\" he commented, \"At all.\"nSara wondered if this was really true, but of course she didn't saynanything. When she didn't, Derek discovered her true feelings. \"Look, Saraneven when I was with Nikki I didn't feel the way I do about you!\" \"Well it's the same with me but I just hate it the way she's always on ournbacks and she's always looking at you and everything!\" \"That doesn't mean anything,\" he said, as both of them rose into a sittingnposition facing each other, \"Let her look. I ain't gonna look back,\" Saranknew there was no use for words in that moment; Derek had said what needednto be said. \"I love you Sara,\" Derek said. Once the sentence was over, henwas surprised that he had said it. He hadn't even thought of it, it justnslipped out of his mouth. Sara was surprised too, by the look on her face. \"You what?\" she asked with a huge smile on her face. Derek laughed, \"I love you!\" Sara took a deep breath and replied with those same threenwords. They finished that topic with a long kiss. --------------- At around midnight Sara figured she should either go home or at least callnRoy. Derek handed her the phone and she slowly dialed the numbers. Shenfigured he might not even be home, and her guess was right. She did,nhowever, leave a message on his answering machine explaining that she wasnspending the night at Chenille's house. Which was true, she just didn't saynDerek was there as well. Once the message was recorded, Sara lay down oncenmore, and Derek came out of his room with a big, baggy sweater around hisnarm. \"Here, put this on,\" he suggested, handing it to her with a smile. Sara,nhowever, looked confused. \"Why?\" She asked with a puzzled look on her face. However, she did put thensweater on. \"It's gettin' cold out,\" he replied simply. Then, Derek brought out anblanket and lay down with Sara, putting the blanket loosely around them. Hengently wrapped his arms around her and both of them felt suddenly at peace.n. . happy. Sara let out a quiet sigh of joy, and Derek smiled to himself.nIt was going to be a great night.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 4 That morning Sara woke up sore and tired. Although it had been an amazingnnight just lying there with Derek's warm and welcoming arms around her, hernface still pained unbelievably. They didn't wake until a little after 10 innthe morning, and boy did it feel good to sleep in. When she first woke up,nSara was startled and didn't remember where she was. It then all came backnto her. . .Nikki. . . the fight. . . Sara walked over to where Derek was standing, making breakfast for the bothnof them. Chenille had already left earlier in the morning to do somenthings, so it was just Derek and Sara in the house now. Mama Jean had takennChristopher over to her friend's house out in the valley, and apparentlynthey had ended spending the night there. Sara wrapper her arms warmlynaround Derek's shirtless stomach and whispered \"I love you\" into his ears.nA smile crept across his face and he turned around to face Sara; repeatingnher words. He ran his fingers through her dirty-blonde hair and kissed hernlovingly on the top of her head and, with a smile, returned to makingnbreakfast. \"How are you feelin'?\" he asked Sara, as the toast popped out of thentoaster. She briefly ran her finger over the deep scratch on her cheek andnimmediately flinched \"Ugh. . . Not good,\" she replied. Just then a shot went off outside andnSara and Derek ran to the window. All they could see was a big winternjacket with fur around the hood running down the sidewalk with a gun. \"Jesus. . .\" Derek started, and Sara saw his face turn from wonderment tonhorrific. \"What? Who. . .What is it Derek?\" \"Jesus Christ, it's Malakai!\" Derek exclaimed, as the figure became nonlonger visible. Then, suddenly a loud knocking sound was heard in thendirection of the door. Derek and Sara looked at each other and decided tonopen it. Derek eased closer as Sara stayed by the window \"DEREK, OPEN UP MAN!\" The voice said and Sara let out a gasp. It was indeednMalakai. Derek slowly opened the door while Malakai slipped inside. \"What the hell you doin' man?\" Derek asked, trying to sound strict butnworriless at the same time. Malakai looked around and saw Sara, nervouslynwatching the two of them talk. \"What's she doin' here?\" He asked rudely. Sara bit her lip trying not tonsay anything. . .maybe she was overreacting but he DID have a gun. . . \"What do you mean what's she doin' here? She's my girl Malakai,\" he repliednharshly- getting his point across. Malakai shrugged it off and continuednaround the house, \"Man- what are YOU doing here?\" Derek asked once again \"Man, the cops are after me man. . .I just gotta chill here for a bit,na'ight?\" \"No, it's not alright, Kai. You can't stay here,\" Derek replied, walkingnover toward Sara and grabbing hold of her as if he was afraid Malakai wasngoing to do something. \"What do you mean man? C'mon Derek I got no place else to go man. . .younknow that,\" \"I do know it,\" Derek said, becoming more persistent now, \"but you can'tnstay here. . .you're not gonna' drag me into this, too. . .or Sara,\" \"Man fuck that. . .Fuck her!\" \"Fuck you!\" Sara replied, immideatly wishing she hadn't. Malakai pulled outnhis gun and pointed it directly at Sara, letting it hover there for anmoment. Then, after a few moments he pointed it toward Derek and. . .henfired.[Chapter 5] {Note- Thank you HAA for your (many) reviews. . .and I'm glad you enjoynwhat I'm writing. If you have friends who go on this site, could you benkind enough to refer me to them, so I get reviews from them as well? If youncan, thanks and if not that's okay too I enjoy reading you pleasantnreviews} CHAPTER 5 \"DEREK!\" Sara screamed as he fell to the floor, clutching his arm. Thankngod it didn't hit his stomach, Sara thought. She could hear the policentrying to get inside, and apparently Malakai did too, and he fled. Saranreached for the cordless phone and dialed the numbers 9-1-1 \"9-1-1, what is your emergency?\" An operator's voice answered. Derek wasnshaking from pain and Sara, while on the phone, tried to calm him down,n\"It's okay, it's okay just hold on,\" she kept repeating. . .to herself asnmuch as to him. When the ambulance arrived, Sara pleaded with the paramedics to let herninside the ambulance with Derek but they refused. Worried and confused,nbitter and anxious, Sara rushed over to where her dad was playing.nThankfully he was on a break, and she told him what had happened. He letnher borrow the car, and Sara rushed her way over to the hospital. \"Where can I find Derek Reynolds?\" She asked as she felt a bead ofnperspiration drip down her pale forehead. The woman told her and Sara rannover to the elevator and hit floor number 3. That elevator ride was maybenthe longest she'd ever taken. All of the \"what if's\" came rushing into hernhead at once. What if he's hurt badly? What if Malakai comes after me next?nWhat if the doctors can't fix it? What if. . . Her thoughts wereninterrupted by the ding as the elevator arrived on her floor. She oncenagain wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead off, and headed toward thenroom in which she was told Derek would be. She saw at least five doctorsnaround him, but she could see him moving so that had to be a good sign. .n.right? \"Are you Sarah Johnson?\" A nurse asked her. Sarah took a deep breath andnsaid that she was. \"You may come inside, Ms. Mr. Reynolds has beenndemanding you're in here with him,\" she said as she led Sara into thenemergency room. She heard a loud scream come from Derek as the doctornslowly pulled out the bullet from his upper-arm. Sara walked over besidenDerek's head and awkwardly grabbed hold of his hand. He yelled out oncenmore as the doctor pulled the full bullet out and put it on a cloth on anmetal table beside him. He muttered some medical terms to his co-doctorsnand exited the room. \"Is he going to be okay?\" Sara demanded. At first the doctors ignored hernas they continued to do something or other to his arm, but once she becamenmore demanding they answered, \"He'll be fine,\" one of them quickly replied, reaching for a strip ofnbandage. Sara let out a sigh of relief and closed her eyes for a moment.nHow could things go from extremely good to extremely bad in a matter ofnminutes? She remembered waking on the couch. . .Derek's couch. Then shenremembered feeling him whisper the words \"I love you\" into her ears and nownhe was in the hospital, with a hole in his arm because of Malakai. She thennsaw the doctors pack up their things and start walking out the door, beforenone of them stopped to fill Sara in. \"Mr. Reynolds will be fine. . .he's still in pain but that will cease overntime. You're welcome to stay as long as you want to,\" she added beforenwalking out completely. Sara then pulled a chair over closer to Derek andnsaw him flinch in pain. It hurt her to see him like this. . .that was love. \"Take deep breaths,\" Sara suggested, kissing his hand softly as he triednbreathing deeply, but ended up coughing anyway. She could feel him stillnshaking and she tried to calm him down by talking about other things suchnas Georgetown. . .but she could tell he wasn't even listening. She saw hisneyes start to close and she figured he'd be falling asleep soon. \"I love you,\" she whispered as she kissed his cheek, \"I'll be here waitingnwhen you wake up alright?\" She replied, managing a small sliver of a smile.nSara knew it was hard for him to do, but he attempted a smile too. \"Sara. . .\" he started, suddenly flinching and holding his arm, \"I love younso much,\" he said as he looked into her eyes deeply. . .and then henwelcomed sleep with open arms.[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 6 The next few days were hard on both Sara and Derek, for Derek's arm seemednto be hurting more and more each day. After spending five days at thenhospital the doctors released him on the condition that he not do anythingnexhilarating or exciting for at least a week, until his arm got better.nAlthough she wanted to be with him 24/7, Derek made Sara promise she'dncontinue practicing dancing. \"You need to keep workin' it,\" He'd say, asnSara got him some ice-cream and brought it to him on the couch. \"I know. . .but that can wait,\" She replied, sitting down next to him. Shenglanced outside his window and realized how beautiful it was. Although itnwas still pretty cold outside, the sun was shining on the trees which werenjust starting to turn green again. \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" Shenasked, suddenly having the urge to do something. \"I mean, if you're up fornit,\" \"Yeah, sure,\" he replied, \"Some exercise'll be good for me right?\" Henadded, slowly getting up with the assistance of Sara. She grabbed his coatnalong with hers and headed outside. Once they were out, Sara went to his left side, not wanting to bother hisnsore arm. Once she was on that side, Derek put his arm around her with ansly smile. \"What are you smiling about?\" She asked with a chuckle \"Nothing. . .\" he said, still grinning. Sara looked puzzled, but she hadnthe feeling that was what he wanted. She shrugged it off and continuednwalking. They walked down toward an old park, filled with children, dogs,nand couples like them going for scenic walks. They stopped by a small pondnfilled with tiny little fish and sat down on a bench nearby. Derek seemed anlittle nervous or twitchy, and Sara asked him if there was anything wrong.nHe just replied that his arm was bothering him and she accepted the answer.nSuddenly Derek reached into his pocket and slowly brought something out. \"What's that?\" Sara asked. When she saw what it was, Sara's eyes nearlynfell out of the sockets. There, in Derek's hand was a 10-karat diamondnring. Derek smiled again, and even though it was hard for him to do, whatnwith one arm and all, he got down on one knee. Sara had always envisionednthis moment, but now that it was here she didn't quite believe it. She feltnher eyes start to water, and her hand covered her mouth while she tried tonfight the tears. Derek chuckled once again, and said those magical words. \"Sara. . .\" He started, sweetly trying to sound cool and calm about it all,nwhile Sara could tell he was scared to death, \"Will you marry me?\" Therenwas no doubt in Sara's mind what the answer was, and she proudly answerednthe lingering question. Through the tears that were now spilling down herncheeks, she replied \"yes\". Derek jumped up and with a proud smile on hisnface; he placed the beautiful ring on Sara's finger. She slowly got up offnof the bench and inched closer to her now fiancée. Derek started sayingnsomething, but Sara pressed her finger against his lips and replaced itnwith her own lips. They could feel people watching them, either in awe orndisgust; whatever it was they really couldn't care less. Once they stoppednand continued walking, Sara seemed to be glowing with happiness. \"Derek. . .I love you,\" She announced sweetly as Derek reached for her palenhand. He stopped suddenly and faced her; right there in the middle of thenstreet. Derek put his hand on her face and gently caressed it. \"Sara I couldn't have made it without you,\" he replied, \"The shooting, Inmean. I remember being on that table. . .and your face was the first thingnI saw. That gave me hope. . .desire,\" Sara looked at him in awe. How couldnsomeone make her feel this way? It was truly, truly amazing. She ponderednon what to say in response to that. She decided on what was true. \"I couldn't have done it without you either. . .if you hadn't gotten menback into ballet I'd be missing out on the best opportunity of my life,\" \"You did that yourself,\" He replied, smiling and adding another kiss.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 7 Sara watched Chenille's face as her and Derek told her about their newnengagement. Sara held out her hand and Chenille's hands touched the ring innwhat seemed to be astonishment. A smile formed on her face as she hopped upnand screamed with joy, hugging both her best friend and her brother. With ansigh of relief, Sara hugged her back. \"I can't even believe this!\" Chenille exclaimed, as Derek wore that hugengrin across his face once more. \"Who would'a thought. . .my brother and bynbest friend! This is gonna' be one hell of a family, won't it?\" she added,nwith a laugh. With all the excitement and screaming, Christopher and wokennup and was not the least bit happy. Chenille left the room to go and tendnto him as \"Mama Dean\" entered the room, looking a little confused. \"What's going on?\" She asked Derek in her quiet, soft-spoken way. Derek gotnup and with him, lifted Sara's hand. Mama Dean's eyes widened as she lookednat the ring. . .the ring to Derek. . .then to Sara. \"We're engaged Mama,\" Derek pronounced, kissing the side of Sara's headnplayfully. \"Well I'll be John Brown,\" she exclaimed, laughing, \"Welcome to the familyndarling,\" she added as she leaned in for a warm hug which was contentlynreceived by Sara. Now that all of Derek's closest relatives were informednabout their new-found happiness, the happy couple decided to head over tonSara's house to inform Roy. Walking up the narrow steps to Sara's home, it dawned upon Sara that hernfather may very well be at work. She decided to try home anyway, but hernhunch had been right; Roy was at work. \"We could go to his work. . .I haven't seen him play in a while anyway,\"nSara suggested \"Yeah, that's cool,\" Derek replied, \"If he wouldn't mind,\" \"Well his daughter's going to be married soon. . .I'm sure he'd understandnwhy we want to tell him now!\" Sara commented, and with a snicker, the twonheaded on over to the Jazz Club in which Roy was playing. As the couple walked in, hand in hand, they noticed a few people startingnto stare. Sara glanced briefly at one woman. . .she looked very familiar.nAll of a sudden she started laughing to herself, \"Derek!\" she whispered through muffled chuckles \"What?\" he asked in confusion, \"That lady there,\" Sara started, motioning toward a woman talking on a paynphone, \"that's the one that was freaking out that time on the bus!\" Dereknsnorted out a gasp of laughter and, trying to control themselves, Derek andnSara walked past the woman. She continued to stare at the couple and putndown the phone. Walking behind them, the woman followed them into the clubnwhere Sara could hear the recognizable sound of her father's trumpet beingnplayed. Derek and Sara sat down at a table, surrounded by a gray smokencoming from the pipe of a man sitting next to them. Derek looked aroundn(since jazz music wasn't really his thing, he was trying to fix his mind onnother things) and his eyes were drawn to an older couple staring at him.nQuickly Derek looked away, but since they were within earshot, Derekncontinued listening to their conversation. \"Look at that,\" the man said, taking a sip of what appeared to be a beer,n\"I'll tell you, they're over-running the country.\" Derek wondered whon\"they\" were, but his questions were unfortunately answered \"It's true. Just look at that! They're even taking our poor women. Thatnpoor child over there. . .She has no idea what she's getting into, I bet,\"nthe woman replied, taking a puff of her cigarette. Derek could feel hisnface starting to sweat with rage, but he continued to control himself andnlisten \"That's what's wrong with the world today. . .\" the man continued, \". .n.Damn niggers. . .\" That was it. Derek just jumped out of his chair andnwalked out into the hall. Confused, Sara followed him, and Derek banged hisnhead, in rage, against the wall. \"What's wrong?\" Sara asked, confused and a little worried. \"Did you hear what they were sayin' in there?\" He asked, tears of angernspilling down his cheek. Sara put her hand on his shoulder as he pulled outna chair in the hall and slammed himself into it \"Who?\" Sara asked, kneeling down as she heard the controlled sobs comingnfrom Derek. He took a deep breath and shook his head, looking Sara in theneyes \"There was this couple in there. . .I could here them talking about us. .n.about, well. . .me,\" \"What do you mean?\" Sara asked, already knowing the answer deep inside her. \"They called me a fucking nigger!\" Sara's heart sank, and she shook hernhead in disbelief. \"Baby. . .\" she started, reaching in for a hug as he let his face fall intonSara's sweater, \"We can get out of here if you want. . .I can tell my dadnlater tonight.\" \"Nah, it's okay I can just stay out here for a while. . .\" \"No, we can go. C'mon,\" She replied, hugging him once again as he got upnfrom the chair and the two left; tears and all.[Chapter 8] CHAPTER 8 Storming out of the club, Derek felt the eyes of curious strangers staringnat him. It had just occurred to him what a scene he must have made. \"Derek, try to calm down. . .\" Sara said, trying to relax him. She put hernhand softly on his shoulder, but was swatted away by Derek \"No one's ever called you a nigger!\" He exclaimed, lowering his head. \"I'mnsorry,\" he said, after a while of just standing there, staring at eachnother, \"It's not just this time either. This isn't the first time I'venheard someone talk about us like that,\" he added, wiping a bead of sweatnfrom his forehead. Just then he spotted the old couple walking out of thenclub, and Sara had to hold him back. \"It's not worth it,\" she tried, and the two walked back to Sara's house.nOnce inside, Sara fixed them both a plate of left-over pizza from the nightnbefore. They sat down on the couch that had once been Sara's bed, since thenkitchen table needed to be fixed and slanted to one side. Even though shendidn't want to discuss it, Sara knew the situation they had just come fromnneeded to be dealt with. \"I don't get it,\" she started, taking a bite out of her pizza, \"Why does itnbother people so much. . .it's none of their damn business,\" \"I know,\" Derek replied, before taking a sip of his Coke, \"But that's life.nI don't even know why I got so upset there. . .it was just everythingncomin' out at once,\" \"You know, fuck them and what they think,\" Sara replied. Derek laughed, \"If it were that easy everything would be alright. It's just. . .Whennpeople look at us I know they judge us. . .I can feel it,\" \"So can I,\" Sara replied, \"And I hate it! We don't judge them, why do theyneven give a rat's ass about us?\" \"'Cause of me,\" Derek replied as he put the slice of pizza down and starednSara in the eye, \"It has nothing to do with you. When people see us, thenfirst thing that comes to mind is 'Oh that poor white girl'. I just can'tnstand it. . .they think I'm a thief or something,\" \"But you're not, so ignore them,\" \"Sara it's not that easy. You don't even know what it's like. . .day by daynhaving old couples talkin' about you when you walk in the door; callin' youna fuckin' nigger,\" He replied, as he watched Sara's expression change, \"No, I don't have those things said about me,\" She started, grabbing fornhis hand, \"but what's even worse is watching them say it about you. Thatnhurts just as much, Derek.\" Derek looked at his fiancée in awe. She hadnjust taken away every ounce of pain in him and replaced it with love; fornher. He smiled, and the two kissed once more. That was the end of thatnconversation. Derek left Sara's house at around 9 o'clock that night, and when her dadncame home, Sara found she was tired from her long day. That didn't,nhowever, stop her from informing him about their good news. As she heardnhim walk up the stairs, Sara hopped up off of the couch; ready to tell. \"Hey Roy,\" She started, acting extra nice to him. He smiled and returnednthe greeting. \"I have something to tell you,\" she started. Roy turnednaround and with a look of concern on his face asked \"what?\" \"Are you alright, Sara?\" He asked, edging closer to his daughter \"No it's not like that,\" She reassured him, \"It's. . .well. . .\" she heldnout her ring finger, hoping he would understand so that no more wordsnneeded to be said. His eyes widened as he looked at the ring, then Sara. .n.Sara, then the ring. \"Is this. . .\" \"An engagement ring? Yes! Derek and I are engaged Roy,\" She finished hisnsentence for him. Although he didn't appear to be angry or sad, Sara hadn'tnyet seen a formal reaction. Finally he spoke, \"Sara, congratulations,\" he finished, although he didn't sound verynenthusiastic, Sara believed him and the father and daughter shared a hug.[Chapter 9] CHAPTER 9 On Monday morning, Sara walked up the outside steps and over to wherenChenille, Derek, Diggy, and Snookie were standing. She greeted Derek first,nwith a heart-felt kiss as the other watched them with a smile. Once theynwere finished, Sara greeted Diggy and Chenille with their \"handshake\" andnsimply said \"hi\" to Snookie. \"Girl, that ring's some nice! Did Derek give that to ya'?\" Diggy asked,ntaking a sip of her Coca Cola with a straw. She removed her headphones fromnher ears and waited for a reply \"Yeah, actually. . .\" Sara started, then smiled, \"It's actually annengagement ring. . .\" Diggy's eyes widened and after a while of justnstanding there in astonishment, she smiled and laughed, \"Damn, girl! Why don't you tell me these things?!\" She yelled, beforenleaning in for a hug. \"Ain't you gonna' congratulate them Snookie?\" Diggy asked, playfullynpushing him. Snookie walked over to where Derek was standing, \"Man, you got problems, man. . .\" he commented, with a stern look on hisnface. All of a sudden the frown was replaced with a large smile, \"You gottantell me when you do somethin' like that, man!\" Just then the morning bellnrang and the group split up and went to their classes. At lunchtime, Sara grabbed her plate and walked over to Chenille's tablenwhere Diggy, Portia, and Trenyce were sitting, eating there lunch. Sarannoticed Chenille seemed distracted, and then realized she was reading whatnappeared to be some kind of text book. \"What's that?\" She asked, taking a bite out of her chicken-salad sandwich.nChenille continued reading before she realized that the question wasndirected at her, and she lifted her head for a moment, \"Jus' this history book,\" she replied, again putting her head down to skimnthrough it, \"we got a test right after lunch. . .Couldn't study at all lastnnight; Christopher cryin' and cryin'. . .\" Sara replied by a simple nod,nand continued eating her lunch when she saw Derek approach the table. \"Hey,\" She greeted him, which was followed by their usual greeting-kiss. \"Hey baby. . .\" he started, \"Hey, do you got a minute?\" He added, againnwith that sly grin he had on his face \"Umm, yeah sure. . .\" She replied, grabbing her jacket, plate and hat. Shenwalked over to the trash can and dumped her garbage in it, and then Derekngrabbed her hand and led her out the door. While they were walking down thenhalls, they passed Nikki. Sara could feel an almost smile form across hernface as she watched Nikki's face as she realized that they were engaged. \"Where are we going?\" Sara asked, once they had exited the school and werenwalking down the street \"Well, I called this dude about like wedding cakes and shit. . .\" henstarted, looking Sara in the eye, \"And this was the only time that we couldnmeet today so I said yeah. . .Jus' to look at the cakes and you know. . .nthat stuff. . .\" Sara's smile was now greater than she could ever havenimagined \"Derek, that's awesome!\" She replied, as she wrapped her arms around hisnneck and pulled his lips onto hers. Once they were finished, Derek laughednand pointed down the road, \"It's jus' down there,\" The building seemed so different from all the others in the neighborhood,nthis one appeared to be brand-new and there wasn't any graffiti on it.nAlthough it wasn't very big, when Sara walked in she could feel a suddennwarmth wrapped around her and was greeted instantly by a woman namednCamille \"Welcome,\" she started. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun and hernlips were colored with dark red lipstick, \"How can I help you today?\" \"Uh, we have a reservation I think,\" Derek replied, looking around hernshoulder at the clip board \"Alright, and your names?\" \"Derek Reynolds and Sara Johnson,\" he replied, the woman's eyes slowlynmoving down the page until she came across their names and with her pen,ncrossed them off. She looked up and smiled, \"Alright then, come along this way,\" she led them to another, smaller roomnwith model cakes and napkins, flowers and plastic bride and groomsnsurrounding it. She put her clip board down on a leather chair andncontinued walking over to a large, white cake with what seemed to be fivenlayers on it. \"Is this something like you're looking for?\" She asked, pointing to thencake that was placed in front of them. Sara and Derek looked at each other,nand then back at the cake. Although it looked very nice, they both found itnto be a little plain. They were then directed to a book of cakes, wherenthey picked a perfect one. Once the cake was chosen, Derek glanced at hisnwatch and saw that it was 12:57. . .The afternoon bell rang at 1:05. \"We better go,\" he whispered to Sara, showing her the time. Sara nodded andntold the woman \"Oh, what a shame. . .Will you be back?\" \"Yeah, can we make a reservation now?\" Derek asked \"Sure, and what time would you like to come back to us?\" She asked with anmore-than-happy smile. Derek and Sara briefly discussed it and came to thenconclusion that it was best to come back in a week's time, since school wasngetting more intense with exams coming up and such, they should have a weeknfor studying. Sara and Derek walked back to school with smiles on theirnfaces. . .They were actually going to be Mr. and Mrs. Johnson one day notntoo far away.[Chapter 10] I'd just like to thank you all for your patience. . .there has been a lotngoing on in my life lately, but thankfully it has all been straitened out.nI'm sorry for leaving you on the cliffhanger, if you will, but I promisenthat I will be writing more frequently from now on. Thank you again. CHAPTER 10 As Sara brought out her English binder and started writing her essay whichnwas due tomorrow, a thought crossed her mind. How were her and Derek to getnmarried when he was going to Georgetown and she was going to Julliard? Shendidn't want just another marriage among young adults who end up getting andivorce within the first ten years. Could they actually have a long-ndistance marriage? Or would a long-distance engagement be better? All thisnthinking was taking her mind off of her work, so she promised herself thatnshe would discuss it with Derek later that day. After the last bell rang, Sara headed toward her locker and saw Kenney andnChenille talking. Chenille appeared to be happy; she was laughing and had anhuge smile on her face. \"Hey Chenille. . .Kenney,\" Sara greeted them with a subtle smile. Chenillensmiled back and returned the greeting. \"So did you have that pop quiz in Beckman's class?\" Chenille asked asnKenney left her locker. Sara, opening her locker, answered yes. \"How do younthink you did?\" \"Alright, I guess. What about you?\" \"Didn't know hardly any of it girl. . .Christopher had a cryin' attacknagain last night. I'm tellin' you girl, that kid will not shut up!\" \"Well if. . .\" Sara started, reaching into her locker and pulling out herncoat as well as her backpack, \"if you ever want to drop him by my house. .n.you know, if you have to study or something I could look after him for anwhile.\" Chenille turned around and looked over at Sara with a smile on hernface. \"You'd do that?\" \"Yeah, I mean if you ever needed to,\" \"Well I'll think 'bout it, a'ight?\" \"A'ight,\" Sara answered, and with a giggle, the two exited the building. Once they got outside, Sara was greeted by Derek's smiling face and hisnlips soon met hers. With a smile, the group started walking when some guynSara had never seen before intercepted their path. With an angry look onnhis face, his eyes were on Derek. \"Man what you doin'?\" Derek asked, trying to get past him but the mannstepped in front of him once again. \"What am I doin'? Why don't you ask how Malakai is doin'?\" Derek lookednstunned and confused \"What? Man, what are you talking about?\" \"Yeah you know. I know you know. Kai's gonna' be on trial for attemptednmurder and that's all you got to say to me? C'mon man, I ain't that dumb,\"nthe man took a breath and wiped his mouth, \"Now why don't you tell me whynthe fuck you think you had the right to peep on him?\" \"Peep on him? Man the dude shot me! And you think I'm just gonna let himnget away with it? Nah. He used to me my boy, yeah. . .but not anymore,\" \"You peeped, man! Now that them lawyers and shit are lookin' at his recordnhe'll probably be sent to the chair, man! They jus' want him out of thenstreets, and this is their chance! It's your fault, man. If you hadn't anpeeped on him man nothin' like this would'a been happening,\" \"Look, Kai shot me. What do you think I was supposed to do, man. It's nonenof your damn business anyway,\" Derek replied, attempting to walk past himnbut the stranger stopped him \"It's my business, man, Kai's like a brother to me man. . .\" \"I really don't give a shit,\" Derek replied coldly, when all of a sudden hensaw a fist come flying at him. He threw one back, along with a few swear-nwords and kicks, but eventually the fight was stopped and they went theirnown separate ways. Who was he? Derek wondered.[Chapter 11] NOTE- I apologize again and again for not updating this story in so longn... I hope that I'll be writing more lately, but I can't make any promises.nI thank you so much for your wonderful comments! You readers are the mainnreason I'm still writing now ... so thanks again and enjoy( CHAPTER 11 Derek stormed away with Sara by his side, grasping his arm tightly. Alongnwith Chenille and the others, they all walked home without saying a wordnexcept when Derek and Chenille left, Sara gave him a soft kiss and theynwent their separate ways. Sara tried opening her door but, as usual, her father was out so she pullednout her key and entered the small home they shared. She put her books downnon the counter and flopped down on the ratty old couch. She rubbed herntemples with her two index fingers roughly; her headache from the fight hadnturned into a migraine. She pondered why the fight had even broken out forna moment. Who was that man, and what did he want with Derek? Obviously henwas some sort of kin of Malakai's and wanted revenge for putting him behindnbars. Had this man been talking to Kai lately? If he had, they would havenbeen able to plan things ... Sara stopped herself from thinking about this.nMalakai was behind bars, he couldn't hurt anyone anymore. Sara flipped on the television and, as if she hadn't been thinking aboutnhim enough, she saw Malakai's face plastered on one of the local newsnchannels. She told herself it wouldn't help to watch it, but she couldn'tntear her eyes away. \"...currently up in the air. Malakai Jones is pleading not guilty againstnthe charges pressed by Derek Reynolds after Mr. Jones shot him in his ownnhome. Malakai says he only shot Derek in self defense, that he and Dereknhad been friends previous to this incident. Fortunately Derek Reynolds,nsoon to be Doctor Derek Reynolds (Sara felt a smile creep across her facenas she heard the word doctor) was not permanently injured by the shooting.nWill this case go to trial? WVS News will be here for you to find out.nAlexis Martin reporting on assignment. Back to you, Nancy.\" Sara, although her head was still throbbing, forced herself up off of thencouch. She headed over to get an Advil which she hoped would help hernpounding ache. She poured herself a tall glass of sparkling water to washnit down, and with a heavy gulp and the tilt of her head it went down.nRubbing her head again, she decided to take a nice, hot shower. She reached for the bottle of shampoo, took a whiff of its soothingnfragrance (Aloe Vera with a hint of Passion Flower) and squeezed some outnonto her palm. Gently massaging it through her long blond hair, shenpondered more what she had been meaning to discuss with Derek. How wouldnthey be able to get married while he would be at Georgetown and she atnJulliard? Of course, she supposed Derek hadn't completely forgotten aboutnthese factors when he asked for her hand in marriage, but she stillnwondered. Did he have a plan, or was he as confused as she was? She begannto rinse the shampoo out of her hair and reached for the conditioner whennshe heard a bang on the door. Irritated, she tried to ignore them; if itnwas important they'd come back, right? But when they persisted, she sighednheavily and turned off the water. She hopped out of the tub, reaching fornthe towel on the rack as she rushed to the door. \"I've been meaning to talk to ...\" Derek started, before he looked up andnsaw Sara with her hair wet and a towel wrapped around her. \"Oh,\" he saidnlooking more than a little embarrassed. \"I was just ... in the shower and I heard you knocking so ...\" Sara said asnshe felt her face turning beet-red. A smile slowly crept across his facenand he let out a hearty laugh which was followed by an equally heart-feltnone offered by Sara. \"Come in,\" Derek stepped in, taking his coat off andnplacing it on the couch which used to be Sara's sleeping area. He lookednaround for a moment when his eyes rested on a box of Advil on the counter. \"Are you feelin' okay?\" \"Oh, yeah I'm fine I just had a little headache. That's why I was in thenshower too ... I'm feeling better now though, don't worry about me,\" Shenreplied, putting the box back where it came from. \"You sure? Here ... lie down,\" Derek sat himself down on the couch andnoffered a spot next to him to Sara which she graciously accepted. Shenspread out her feet over his legs as Derek started massaging her feetngently. She closed her eyes for a minute as Derek began to speak, \"Have you ever seen that guy before? Like at school or ...\" Sara shook hernhead and asked him the same, \"Nah, I've never seen the guy my whole life.nMan ... he was probably just some dude Kai knew, he'll get over it,\" Dereknsaid, sounding more like he was assuring himself than Sara. \"You did the right thing,\" Sara convinced him. Derek looked down at her asnher hair was being gently wrapped around his finger. He sighed for a momentnbut then looked into Sara's eyes and nodded. \"Yeah ... yeah, I know it was. If Kai was still hustlin' on the streetsnpeople would be dyin' all over the place. They are anyway but ...\" Henstarted, all of a sudden noticing how quiet Sara was. \"How come you're notnsayin' anything?\" \"Nothing just ... Never mind,\" She replied shaking her head and putting onna little smile. She could see, however, that she couldn't fool him. He knewnher too well \"Just tell me.\" \"It's ... It's just I've been thinking about what we're going to do oncenschool starts in the fall. I'll be at Julliard, you'll be at Georgetown ...nI just don't know how we're going to make it work. I mean I really want tonmarry you Derek, I can't wait! It's just ... confusing. Do you have anynideas?\" \"I knew it was somethin' like that. Look, I love you and you love me,nright?\" Sara nodded, \"So it'll work. We'll make it work, I promise.\" \"But how? Do you want to get married before we go away or stay engaged ornwhat ... I mean it's December now, we don't have that long to plan beforenwe go away ...\" Derek put his index finger up to her lip which, until thisnwas still talking. He made a \"Shh\" noise and Sara stopped. He gently leanednin for a kiss which lasted about five seconds until their lips softlynparted. He gently stroked her blond strands of hair with his right hand,nwhile his left was intertwined with hers. For a moment they just lookedninto each other's eyes and Sara knew it would work out. She was in love,nand there was nothing else like that in the world. At that moment nothingnmattered. Not Malakai, not Julliard, not Georgetown, not Chenille, not hernMother, nothing. It was only her and Derek living in the world for thatnmoment and it was indescribable. \"It'll work,\" Derek replied softly as he bowed down once again and her lipsnmet his.

He could think of a few honeys he could be doin right now.nGetting tired with the lecture Mr Johnson was givin, he stood up and left,nand when Mr Johnson called after him he just told the guy he was takin anleak. Yeah well, y'all can try to save me but ain't nutin to save. He shoved his hands in his red and black baggy pants as he moved down thenhallway. He watched through the classroom doors as his fellow peers got onnwith whatever they were doin like they were in some get-kids-out-of-the-nghetto-gangster movie. He was sick of it, nothing ever changed, he wasndestined to die in some whacked out drug deal gone bad, while Derek getsnanything he ever wanted a job a nice family, a down ass honey who'd do allnkinds of shit for him. Malaki realised what he just thought, yeah so what if his trailer trashnwas a honey she was milk and Malaki was the nastiest oil she'd ever hook upnwith. What was he thinking, she'd never hook up with him, he'd treated hernlike a ho from the start. Malaki had looked through tonnes of windows until he got to Mrs Turner'snand there she was her green combats were hanging off her as she slumpedndown in her chair, her purple jersey hiked up a little from the chairnshowin just a little of her stomach, that white flesh. Malaki stared in asnshe twiddled her hair which today she had just left down unlike her usualnaccessorizing, he wanted her so bad, she was driving him crazy. Her lips,nher hair, how he'd love to hold her down by those wrists, he could justnimagine her screaming his name as he... **imagine if I told you I want you imagine if it all came true tell me what you would do with me would you tell me that you feel the same imagine if I told you that I need you would you say baby I need you too no matter what you do I know you should be in love with me** Shit! He had to get a handle on himself, he slammed his fist into the door,nknocking out the glass and shocking the hell out of the class inside,neveryone looked up except Mrs Turner who had run to the door. When she opened it up Malaki didn't run, he just stood there, his left handndripping with blood and his eyes fixed on Mrs Turner cause if he lookednanywhere else Sara would know. He could feel those brown eyes on him, asnMrs Turner led him away from the door and up to the principal's office.nOnce they got there she gave him a band aid, I guess the nurse wasn't innthat day. 'What the hell were you thinking?' the principal shouted at him because itnwas the only way to get him to stop looking at the door, thinking of waysnto escape or to stop acting like a baller. 'I weren't, Ma'am,' he said looking around as his parole dude came in. Sara sat there getting really bored, Mrs Turner never shut up! She slouchednback in her chair and played with her hair, too tired this morning to donanything special with it. Suddenly she thought how good she'd got it, evennthough the past few months had been rough, she and Derek were together,nShineal and her had made friends and Julliard had accepted her, now all shenhad to do was get through the next few months and leave this school and itsninhabitants behind, namely Malaki. What did she ever do to him, he was always on her back, he was a drugndealer, a low life, he had no respect for Sara and she knew he hated hernbut why? Just because she was white, what a load of crap, Ziggy's white;nMalaki never had a problem with her and that other friend of Malaki's. Maybe it was because it was his best friend and a white girl, that night atnthe club when he'd said she was milk and Derek was oil, he was so close tonher, she could feel his breath on her neck as he walked up to her, Sara wasnhappy she had a good guy, Derek was wonderful, she didn't go for that Machoncrap, she didn't buy into that bad boy thing but she couldn't deny thatnMalaki was good looking. By the time she heard the crash of a fist to glass Sara had completelynzoned out. Looking up shocked she saw him there, his right hand drippingnwith blood, his eyes cold and that look of pain, she just wanted to it tongo away that he'd accept her, want her. **you make me wanna leave the one I'm with start a new relationship with you this is what you do think about him and the things that come along with you make me you make me wanna leave the one I'm with start a new relationship with you this is what you do think about him and the things that come along with you make me you make me**[Chapter 2] Malaki swung his head around the room not looking at the much older guy innfront of him.n'Look...if you mess up again, it's off to Juvy, and don't think your notngonna pay for the door either,' Mr Jennings was not in the mood for anothernone of Malaki's emotional outbursts of anger.n'Yes sir,' Malaki shined him on with a fuck you smile.nMr Jennings just got up and left. Again he hadn't gotten through to him, hendidn't think anyone could at this point. Malaki sat there waiting for MrnJennings to be gone. Once he was, he was outta there. Malaki got to hisnlocker and looked up and down the hall before getting out his weed and gun.nHe shoved them in his black baggy pants, he knew a few fools he couldnsqueeze for today. Like he really knew anything about me, he don't know nutin'. It's not mynfault, its only way I get by, I got needs to meet and it ain't like I canngo to college, I ain't no college boy. Derek can do that but it weren't noncollege boy who saved his ass. Malaki fooled himself; he was on his way outnwhen the bell sounded, all his people were getting the hell outta class. Itndidn't matter what colour they were, he owned 'em. He just couldn't get hernto...he just couldn't get her. It's not like he wanted to sit down and have annice conversation with her, he wanted to do her. Simple as, no messin. Whatnwould a educated fool like him do with a white girl? Anything he wanted,nthat's what. He zoned out amongst them, the crowds, till he got to hisnbrothers, the guys who got his back. They was fools to, smoked up, about tonget choked up. That was his life, it would never be hers, and she was goinnoff to dance somewhere. He'd give his stash to touch her body and dancenwith her, at least. I got five on it, Grab you four, Lets get keyed, I got five on it, Messin' wit that Indo weed, I got five on it, It's got me stuck and not go back, I got five on it, Ponta lets go half on a sac. Sarah grabbed her shit and ran for the door, that bell was a release fromnthat stupid woman, Mrs Turner. She totally freaked out about that glass; Inwonder how his hand is. Who cares? I'm still mad at him, and I'm allowed tonbe, he is a racist asshole. But that did look like it hurt. I wonder why hendid it? Probably thought he could get me through the glass. Sara boundednthrough the hallway, suddenly there he was. His hand was bandaged, his eyesnwere frozen and he was ignoring whatever Lip was saying. Sara didn't wannanwalk past him, not because he might hit her, cause he would know, he'd seenright through her. Sara didn't know why she thought about him, she'd put itndown to a bad boy phase. She had to move; it was starting to look silly hernjust standing there staring. Sara took a deep breath and moved on by.nMalaki watched her as she got down the hall. Derek was waiting by hisnlocker for her when she turned and looked at Malaki. Derek didn't see itnbut Malaki did. With a whip of that blonde hair she had turned back, tonDerek.nWhat was that? I know she just looked at me. Lip stopped talking when he saw Malaki had stopped leaning against thenlocker and started obviously ignoring him. Lip turned around to see wherenhe was looking and when he asked about it, Malaki forced up against thenlockers by his throat.n'I don't wanna hear that shit again,' He said dropping him and leaving, hendidn't need this, he was gonna chill tonight, steps was waiting.nSara couldn't believe she'd looked at him and he had blatantly saw her donit. After feeling like an idiot she hugged Derek and asked how he was. Henwasted no time in telling her he couldn't make it to steps tonight.n'Why?'n'I gotta work, sorry, anyway Sineal look after ya,' Derek smiled as theynwalked off.nSara was really insulted but she kept her mouth shut, after everythingnthey'd been through together, he thought that she needed babysitting.nFine, I'll go and have a great time, she thought. What's love? got to do, got to do with it What's love? It's about us, it's about trust, What's love? got to do, got to do with it What's love? It should be about us, it should be about trust, What's love? When I look in your eyes there's no stopping me, I want the Don Joey Crack on top of me, Don't want your stacks, just break my back, Gonna cut you no slack, Cause I'm on it like that, Come on and put it on me, on me...[Chapter 3] Sara pulled on her new top, it was a halter neck and it didn't make hernlook bad at all. She got in the club; she was comfortable there now. Shenmade her way to the bar with Sineal with Snookie spinning Fat Joe and thenclub was slammin.nMalaki was sitting in his sits, surrounded by friends and honeys, thenliquor was overflowing the cup, these girls were there for him tonight, butnhe weren't interested, he'd seen what he wanted and he was drunk enough tondo something about it. He was tired of it. Thinking about her when he knewnshe didn't think about him, he was gonna make her. Sara sipped on her bacardi and coke as she turned and leaned on thencounter, her hair was already tied up and fine, Sineal had headed off tonthe floor with a friend, he'd be her dancing man till Kenny got there. Sarandidn't see him coming.n'Hey,' he said propping himself up, his frosted shades hiding his eyes.n'What do you want?' Sara was fronting.n'A dance,' Malaki leaned in, 'and anything else you have on offer'.n'Whatever, why don't you go bother someone else'.nMalaki watcher her turn away, which woke him up, his jam, was on. Hengrabbed her hand and got her on the dance floor so fast she didn't haventime to complain.n'What are you doing?'n'This is my jam, Derek would want us to be tight,' he would lie his ass offnto get her to stay with him. Sara didn't know what to do but the music was there, worst of all it wasnslow. Malaki had her close to him, his lips weren't far away. He thoughtnabout all the times he'd wanted her like this and Sara thought of all thentimes she'd feared this, he'd see right through her, she prayed he'd be toondrunk to remember. Sara trembled against him, Malaki could feel her shakingnagainst his jersey. He just held her tighter and wouldn't stop looking atnher big brown eyes as they moved, Sara was trying her hardest not to looknat him, he didn't it, he didn't deserve her, they both knew that but theynwere still dancing and neither would to leave. They couldn't stay thereneither He don't understand you like I do, No he'll never make love to you like I do, So give it to me, Cause I can show you 'bout a real love, And I can promise anything that I do, Is just to satisfy you. P.Diddy and R.Kelly 'Satisfy You' 'What are you looking at?' Sara said softly. 'You'.[Chapter 4] He held onto her tightly as the music got to an end. Sineal had noticed who Sara was dancing with and it wasn't gonna go down well with Derek. The music was thumping' and the people were giving everything they had on that dance floor. As the song changed Sara knew she had to get away, so she pulled herself off Malaki, it wasn't hard as he was still sobering up. Boy I know you want me I can see it in your eyes But you keep on frontin' Won't you say what's on your mind Cause each and every time you need me You give me signs But when I ask you what's the deal You hold it all inside If you wanna be with me You gotta keep it real Tell me what's goin' on Tell me how you feel Cause boy I know you want me Just as much as I want you So come and get my love It's all here for you Destiny's Child 'No,No,No'.[Chapter 5] I don't own any of the lyrics by F.A.T.E or Destiny's Child and i don't own any of the Save the last Dance stuff either.

This is a shorter chap than usual becuase i'm being annoying. Luv Y'all![Chapter 7] Thanks for the review SlytherinChick 101, it scared me lol, which made me write. Hope you like, please review. Peace Y'all.Dedicated to the scary lader mentioned before! Malaki threw Derek over and stood above him his lip barely bleeding, Derek looked like he wanted Malaki to die and that wasn't something Malaki wanted but that's life, shit happens. Sara looked on horrified as they faced off, no words, no more fighting. She needn't Derek to know that nothing happened. 'Derek, it's not what you think, he saved my life last night so I let him sleep on the couch,' Sara said kneeling down to help Derek up. Derek was trying hard to believe her but Malaki was smiling and that made every word Sara said go in one ear and out the other. He may not have trusted Malaki but he wanted to trust Sara, but that single doubt was nagging at the back of his mind, it took over when he saw them together on the stairs and it came every time Malaki smiled. Derek put it aside. Sara felt her heart sank, she knew Derek didn't trust her and it hurt. She couldn't tell him that she had wanted something to happen it would end their relationship but without trust Malaki didn't even have to help with the break up. Derek sucked it up...for now, 'I'm sorry,' he said coldly, 'thanks for what you did' Derek was out of there and took Sara with him. Derek had dragged Sara outside and once they hit fresh air he kissed her hard and fast to make her remember why she was with him, it didn't work. Sara gently pushed him back. 'Derek...' Sara didn't know what to say. I love Derek, I'm sure I do but does he trust me. Why should he? I do want Malaki. I don't why and I can't explain it. I promise I won't act on that want but this about me and Derek. Would it be better if we weren't together, maybe...we are going to go our separate ways after high school, a long distance relationship would be hard but it would be worth it...if we really wanted it. He's a great boyfriend, he's supported me but this isn't eternal, is it? I shouldn't give up so easy, we've been through a lot together and to throw that all away...for Malaki. No. It will work, I can't let Derek down. 'Derek...we're good right?' Sara asked looking in his eyes for some recognition of this being an empty thing. 'Yeah' Derek said as if stamping the occasion. 'I've gotta go to class, I'll see you later,' Sara kissed him briefly and left. Malaki picked up his stuff and headed for the door, he noticed the pen and pad by the phone, his state of mind being that his former best friend just went for him cause he wanted his girl. He scribbled down the message and left, the door locked and he suddenly knew he shouldn't have written it but only she'd read it so it won't be that bad. Sara was tired on Monday morning, the boom box was jumping and everyone else was up and with it. She stopped in front of Sineal who was there to comfort her after her ordeal but all Sara could do was think about Malaki's note. Thanks and hope Derek's finished trippin, hope we can be friends. Malaki It was just so weird for him to write anything like that. It made no sense maybe it was sarcasm, no...it might be. That's it sarcasm. Anything else would be too weird. The other thing that was weird was how whenever he Malaki looks at me I get that feeling like in my chest. Malaki saw her down the hall; he leaned easily against the lockers as his crew surrounded him. Malaki may have been unsure about how Sara felt about him but he knew there was something there and he wasn't gonna be humble about it. He smiled at her with that dirty pimp style, as if she was his bitch. Sara felt dirty and needed to be somewhere else, she walked away from Sineal and into the girl's room. She splashed the cold water on her face. I knew it, I let him in. I was nice to him, he must know how I feel about him and...and now he's gonna use it against me. Oh I cant wait to get next you, Oh I just can't leave you alone, Boy you got me doing things that I would never do, and I cant stop the way I'm feelin' if I wanted to, I'm crazy bout the way you that you could make me say your name, and if I couldnt have you I would probably go insane cause... Ashanti 'Only You' To Be Continued...[Chapter 8] Thanks to those who reviewed and the lyrics aren't mine. This chap is dedicated to lukina starhopper oriana, Draco MalfoyGirl 16, Chasity Claire, esta cena fan, primaballerina0522 and ulove3. You guys give me the kick up the butt to actually continue doing what I love to do. Luv Y'all! Malaki made his manly way down the corridor, surprisingly secure as he made his way into the girl's bathroom. Sara was bent over the sink still with her eyes closed, her hands clasping to the sides of the sink and her head lowered. Malaki slid his hands along her waist. Sara jumped up and whipped round, her hands now clasping the front of the sink, as Malaki got up close and personal.[Chapter 9] Sorry its taken me so long to update but I've been doing my a level module exams. Thanks to everyone who reviewed, this chap is dedicated to ulove3, Stella, Chasity Claire, esta cena fan, Sala and that anonymous person called hi, your words and advice are always welcome. Luv Y'all. Sara took her head out of her hands and took a deep breath, not always a good idea in the school toilets, fresh. Girl was determined. She got off her ass and made a silent oath to herself she was in love with Derek and no sexual tension between her and Malaki could get in between that. This oath stuck with her all day throughout English, biology and even trig. There was a bounce in her step, her head was high, she was comfortable in her mans arms, as the crew stood making arrangements for the night.[Chapter 10] Hey y'all sorry for the almighty long wait; this chappie is dedicated to those who reviewed PrInCeZZ, temi, Hannah, funkycool, Audioslavex and even LukinaStarhopper whose inspired me and CHUCHU123 and flammablepajamies for their input. Luv Y'all! Lukina thanks till I read your profile I didn't know the name to one of my fav sonds and Suga Suga is thanks to ya. Sara's eyes were red, she'd been crying. So confused. What she thought she knew was shit now, it was tainted. They'd fought through so much together, Derek and her. She hated that she was gonna throw it all away for some fucked up attraction to someone who didn't do anything but hate and hurt. All alone in the apartment she got on with her homework and waited for the pot to boil. The light flickered amber across the floor and she couldn't help becoming distracted thinking that everyone was having the time of their life at steps…Derek, Sineal, Snookie, ziggy…and Malaki. The amber light flickered out onto the street below and creeped onto Malaki's arm. All in black he looked up to that window. Hands in pockets taking it easy, contemplating his next move. I pull up Anticipating good love Don't keep me waiting I got plans to put my hands in places I never seen girl you know what I mean Let me take you to a place nice and quiet There ain't no one there to interrupt Ain't gotta rush I just wanna take it nice and slow (now baby tell what you wanna do with me) See I've been waiting for this for so long We'll be makin' love until the sun comes up Baby I just wanna take it nice and slow (now baby tell what you wanna do with me) Usher 'Nice & Slow' What am I doing here? You know what you're doing here. You're here for her. Shit! She's got me whipped like a dog. Don't Matter I got her to. Can't deny that. Something's gotta be done, just do her and leave then it'll all be ova. It don't matter if she's Derek's, I want her. Malaki took his time making his way up the steps to Sara's apartment. Licking his lips Malaki needed to get his cool back but she did something to him, made him lose it. It was cold outside and the warmth of the hallway gave him more incentive to knock on her door. Few moments in Malaki's life could be called brave, sometimes stupid, sometimes selfish and even sometimes smart but brave was what he was being now. Sara jumped out of her skin when she heard the knock at the door, just one knock, loud and clear. She put her pencil inside her textbook and laid it on the table. Uncrossing her legs she got up and hesitantly approached the door, she was afraid of who it was. She left her glasses on and with her voice barely above a whisper she asked politely who was there. Malaki gently said, 'it's me,' his hand on the ledge of the door, his head leaning in to be closer to her. Flashbacks of her dream came back Malaki so close, she could feel him. Sara bit her lip as she unhooked the chain and slowly opened the door. It wasn't the right thing to do but she was tired, tired of doing the right thing, this time she'd…she'd do something different. She clutched the door and came face to face with the boy who had tortured her when she was awake and asleep. Silence descended over them, as they looked at each other a wordless conversation erupted; he said 'forgive me' and she said 'why should I?' Sara realised that he wouldn't apologise that wasn't Malaki. Malaki looked around and back at her. 'You gonna keep me out here all night?' He gave a small smile and laugh. 'Thinking about it,' Sara was all seriousness, because this was serious. Malaki stepped in towards her, Sara didn't flinch as he placed her two steps back and pushed the door closed. 'I messed up…and for that I'm sorry,' as Malaki whispered it Sara was shocked, on the brink of tears and waiting for it to go wrong. Malaki's hand brushed over Sara's, it made its way up her arm to her face. Wiping away the tear his hand slipped round her neck and pulled her in gently to his lips. He kissed her and everything bad in his world was forgotten like his favourite drug of choice. He gripped tighter as she kissed him back. Sara's skin tingled as his other hand removed hers from him and started on the straps of her top. The whistle blew out as the kettle had come to a boil. Sara pulled away and ran to the kitchen. Taking the pot of the cooker and turning off the gas she came to her senses. She was not SINGLE. This was not her, she wasn't a cheater. Now tell me, do you wanna get freaky? Cause, I'll freak you right I will, I'll freak you right i will, I'll freak you like no one ha s ever made you feel. I'll freak you right I will, I freak you right I will, I'll freak ya, freak ya, like no one has ever made you feel...yeah! (now baby tell what you wanna do with me) Usher 'Nice & Slow' Malaki could see her holding onto the counter top staring off into the distance feeling guilty. Fuck it, she's mine, he had his chance and it's my turn, I feel sick just knowing she's thinking about him, she won't be in a minute. Malaki grabbed her and flung her around, she slammed into the wall. He gripped her hands and place them above her head. Leaning in he gave his final speech. 'I want you, if you don't I'll leave, that good enough for ya, cause all this feelin guilty shit, I'm over it, so…' Sara had to regroup he was so close his breath was on her skin and this time it wasn't a dream. She couldn't say it, the words wouldn't come. The guy she wanted had her against a wall, again. Holding her there turned her on, so words weren't necessary. Sara leaned in and kissed him, gently biting his lip and pulling away. 'I'm tired of waiting and pushing you away, I give in,' the words came so naturally. Malaki smirked and lifted her up and carried and dropped her on the living room floor, he prowled above her. Lifting her shirt up and pulling down her joggers, he traced his tongue over her. She pulled off his jacket, his shirt. Before long his hand was down between her thighs. She gave a little groan and he said she could do better. He laid into her, Sara held on tight kissing his chest and biting his lips. Every time she did he pushed harder. Whatever you want, I got it, Papi Don't hesitate, holla at me! What I'm lookin' for Is simple, you see Love and support and sexuality When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave I need you just like air that I breathe But when I'm not with you, I'm missing my peace I got a lot inside I need to release You fulfill my every desire When I'm with you, you take me higher (Wooo woo whoo) You're my afrodisiac You're the only one I'm needin' When I go, I'll come back 'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' You're my afrodisiac You're the only one I'm needin' When I go, I'll come back 'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' Brandy 'Afrodisiac' Sara screamed the place down and pulled herself up from the floor, Malaki followed her to herroom, he wouldn't let her in. 'Where do ya think your goin?' He smiled. Sara caught her breath, 'To get a towl,' she said as if it was the most natural thing in the world. He pulled her to him groping her breast, 'don't you know I'm not like Derek, hungry boy like me goes for seconds'. Sara realised what she was doing when he mentioned Derek's name. She'd tell him the first chance she got, it was over. 'Now now, let's do this,' Malaki said leading her over the couch. Sara could feel him from behind as he kissed her, groped her breasts and thrust himself in her. Sara felt wrong, dirty even and she liked it. The way it made her feel being with him, the way he made her feel. She was so used to being this proper little girl that when she was being intimate she liked to go to a place a little bit darker. Malaki couldn't believe it, everything he wanted, he had and he wasn't gonna leave for the world. Don't think about tomorrow when you getting with a hot girl. Sara lay in his arms and held him tightly, 'hey…want something to eat?' Malaki was so ready for the good treatment, 'yeah ho get to the kitchen'. Sara laughed and dug him in his side before getting up throwing on her bath robe and heading into the kitchen. Malaki sat up against the wall and looked on the girl he never thought he'd get close to, thinking how lucky he was and trying not to think about the future and if they one.

To Be continued…[Chapter 11] So sorry for the lack of updating my only poor excuse was that I had a levels and such to do but I'm back now. This is dedicated to everyone who reviewed especially flammable pajamas, Church123, crystal, xxdownfallxx, Spiritweaver, Rainia Nightwolf, NahNah, Miss Deme, G-Unit Girl, Scarlett Black, xx and the major one that begged and got me off my ass ATF0893. You guys rock, ya slammin. Luv Y'all. Sara's feet hit the cold kitchen floor and the rush of pain hit her. She had taken what she wanted, she'd always thought things through, been reserved that[Chapter 12] Sorry about the very long wait but to be honest I didn't know what I was gonna do with these two. Don't lose hope this is definitely not the end but the end is gonna be soon for this story. Mwah love y'all. 'You will never know what it's like to suffer, Malachi cause this is gonna be over all too soon,' said this young thing that held cold steel not a foot from Malachi. 'Just shoot bitch!' The blood spurted from his lips as she got his words out. He knew what he had done to this boy and knew that the bullet had to pierce him. Funny mamma knew it would end like this, she'd said it to me before, in the kitchen I think. Sara thinks I'm running an errand but she can't be that slow, she's gotta know I was going out to do wrong. Wonder what Lips doing, this is how I get out, my soul will leave this place but the body never made it. Tears stung the eyes of this young gun. His finger got heavy on the trigger. The Bullet left the barrel. Then the gun dropped to Malachi's side as did the young boy. Ronny stood where the boy had once. 'Don't tell Ronny to do nutin!' Ronny said shaking severely relieving his victim of his valuables. Ronny turned to do the same to Malachi but the gun was in Malachi's hand as the bullet was in his belly. Ronny slowly stood up and backed away down the back alley. It's alot, its alot until you get shot or your getting burderd in the dock cuz they caught you with rocks in your sock and when you come out you can't get a job These lil nobs don't understand fully they just care about babes and hoodies their on a hype, till they end up like trife at the end of kidulthood Gotta go from kidulthood to adulthood (i know) Now i must act like an adult would react like an adult should (i know) I gotta brake the cycle, cuz if i go pen or end up dead, then it's my fault. Kidulthood to Adulthood by Bashy The phone ringing shocked Sara out of her thoughts. There were dark ones where she would think of all the terrible places Malachi could have gone. She was thankful to be away from them. Taking off her glasses she rubbed the spot where they rested on her nose as she lifted the receiver. Her father looked on curious as her face turned from the expression of slight tiredness to shock and absolute fear. She slammed down the receiver. 'Dad get the car, you gotta take me to the hospital!' Sara shouted even though the distance between herself and her father wasn't that great. She rushed putting on her jacket and of course her father obliged. The car ride is taking too long, my god he could be dying. What the fuck was he doing? Who was shooting at him? Who was he with? I hate this, not knowing, I should have asked him to stay. If I had asked him to stay maybe he would have and maybe he wouldn't be in a hospital right now, in god damn surgery. Why did they call me? 'Are there any spaces?' Sara was desperate but Chicago Memorial looked jammed. 'Why don't I drop you off and see if I can park down the block?' I couldn't be any luckier when it comes to my Dad, he's always there, does what he can, always wanting to do more. 'Thanks dad,' Sara said before kissing his cheek and bolting out the car. Hospitals. Who the fuck invented this shit hole? I don't like it here, look at the people; they're gross and the staff uncaring. Sara approached the front desk in a hurry. 'Hi, um I was called umm Malachi...I don't know his last name,' Sara was suddenly ashamed of herself, 'he's been shot?' The woman was tired and not on her best behaviour. 'I'm sorry we've had three gunshot victims tonight and none have names'. Now Sara was just plain pissed off, 'Look bitch which one is young black probably has a gun on him?' 'That would be all three, now if you don't calm down, security will escort your white ass out'. Sara went quiet. 'This hospital called me'. 'Give me a second'. She went to a small pile of papers on her desk, she picked them up, shuffled them around then came across one post it and held onto it as she told Sara that her number was the last called on the cell of the patient in 204. It took Sara two and a half minutes to run through the corridors and up the stairs. There it was 204 on the door. The door creaked open and there he was breathing through a tube. 'Jesus Christ what did you do?' Sara burst into floods of tears as she grasped his body. He wasn't awake but the person who was, was the police officer sitting in the corner of the makeshift cubicle unbeknownst to the newest visitor. 'Miss,' the young officer said softly. Sara still jumped. 'Who shot him? Is he gonna be okay?' 'The docs stitched him up he should be fine but I'd ask them if wanna know the specifics, I was hoping miss that you'd know his name and why he'd be in an alley at two in the morning.' All was said with a smile and without an air of snobbery. Sara thought he did that to put her and probably the many others he questioned at ease and without their defense system up and working. Sara composed herself, wiped away a few of the tears. 'I don't know his last name...or where he lives but he goes to school at Lincoln-' Sara was interrupted. '-Park high school, yeah I know that place, went there for a month or two, got kicked out sent to Roosevelt'. His smile disarmed her and even with the interruption she didn't feel he was being rude. 'That's pretty much all I know, I mean I...don't know, I think he was going home, last time I saw him he was leaving my apartment. I just don't know,' Sara said flustered and unable to look the twenty something officer in the eye. She wasn't about to put the man she loved in juvi again. He carried the conversation on as if he was he had known her for years, Sara still wasn't gonna let him have anything. 'I hate to put this on the table but we did find a two guns and I was wondering does...Malachai is it? Does he carry a gun?' 'I don't think so'. 'Well I'm just gonna head down the hall, gonna try the payphone just to find out who our boy is, I'll be back in a few,' he said as he made his way out of the room. 'Chi please wake up, what have you done? You could have just stayed with me you asshole,' Sara whispered in his ear as she cupped his face with her hands. His eyes fluttered open to see an angel before him. 'How the, shit I'm luck'. 'You're not lucky, you got yourself shot and whatever it is you were doing, I don't want a part of it, I wanna be with you I meant it but not the you you think you gotta be, not dealin, not carrying a gun, so I'm more than cool that you're okay but you and me ain't gonna work if you keep down this track'. The tears stung her eyes again, she had ruined everything with Derek, the love they had had because she wanted Malachai. The selfishness of her actions dawned all too well on her. I'm not good enough for Derek anymore and Malachai he may never be good enough for me. 'Don't pull this shit again, you trippin cause I'm hurt, you keep flippin on me, just make up your damn mind!' Malachai felt the pain shoot up his body as he moved. Sara moved back off the bed. 'My mind's made, I was obsessed with you and I made a mistake that's all, I'm not the person I wanna be but I can try, so this is it, I hope you get better soon, but I won't be by and Chi the police officer he's been in your room, he knows what school you go to, that's my fault but he doesn't know your last name, I don't either...' I'm not lovin' you Way I wanted to What I had to do Had to run from you I'm in love with you But the vibe is wrong And that haunted me all the way home So you never know Never, never know Never know enough Til it's over love Til we lose control System overload Screamin' no, no, no, no, no So keep your love locked down Your love locked down Keepin' your love locked down Your love locked down Now keep your love locked down Your love locked down Now keep your love locked down You lose You lose Love Lockdown by Kanye West 'Fuck this shit! Why the fuck did you tell him anything, Sara shit,' Malachai couldn't think, he was too scared. 'They found two guns in the alley, they don't know who they belong to and I'm sorry for everything,' she said barely above a whisper as she edged to the door. Before she left Malachai collected himself, 'Sara'. She turned, 'Yeah'. 'Scruggs, that's my last name'. 'Thanks'. She was gone. Shit, what the fuck am I meant to do now, I've lost my girl within the day I fuckin had her, this is wrong. She can't leave me, I know she doesn't want to. He's gonna come back to arrest me or threaten to. She ran at the first sign of trouble. What the fuck does that say about us? That she's human. What am I meant to do? Be a better person, waste a time. Just thought I could have somebody, my beau that gave a shit about me. That's for someone else. The young police officer re entered. Malachi straightened his posture. 'Hey there I was hoping you'd wake up soon, just got a few questions for ya'. His smile sickened Malachi. I ain't ya boy, pig. This is it, this is where I gotta choose all over again, tell the truth and get sent back to that place or lie as see if I still don't go back there. 'Well son where'd ya girl go?' 'She ain't my girl, don't hardly know her'. Outside the door and down the hall a young boy who had been treated for a blow to the head was sipping on the 7up he'd got out the vending machine. He didn't have his gun but he'd get another one, all he had was time. Sara caught Roy in the waiting room. She kept walking. Roy caught up with her. 'What's goin on?' 'Nothing let's just get outta here, I gotta figure somethings out'. 'Like what?' 'Like how I'm gonna make things better'.

Vada shook her head and laughed. \"Dad, I'm sixteen years old. I'm old enough to be his mother. I can take care of him while you and Shelly are on your cruise.\" Vada replied. He stopped and turned around to face her. \"You better not be old enough to be his mother Vada.\" Harry scolded her. \"Oh Harry.\" Shelly said from the bottom of the stairs. She was carrying Matthew in her arms. \"Vada will be fine to take care of Matt while we are gone. It's just for a few days, why do you have to worry so much?\" Shelly kissed him. \"Here Vada.\" Shelly handed him to her when Vada got off the last step and smiled. \"Hold his head.\" Harry said. \"Dad, I've been his big sister for two years. I know all this.\" Vada responded. \"Where are the emergency phone numbers?\" He quizzed. \"Over by the phone where they always are. Along with the number for the ship and Uncle Phil and Aunt Rose's phone number in case of an emergency; which I really don't think you will have to worry about dad.\" Vada replied. \"I will be the judge of that Vada. Now, what about a fire?\" He asked. Vada sighed. \"I grab Matty and we go to the neighbor's house and call 911. Please go now.\" Vada said. \"Oh alright.\" Harry gave up. \"By Matt.\" Shelly kissed his forehead. Then she rubbed his face with her hand. \"I'm going to miss you so much, I haven't really gone anywhere without you since the day you were born.\" Vada looked up at her stepmom. \"I'll take good care of him Shelly. I promise.\" Vada smiled. Shelly looked at her. \"I know you will. Bye Vada.\" Shelly kissed her cheek. \"Bye Shelly. Bye dad. Enjoy your cruise!\" Vada said. Harry walked out the door without looking back. Shelly closed the door behind her, rolling her eyes which made Vada laugh. Vada looked down at her brother. \"It's just you and me kid. For an entire week. What should we do?\" Vada asked. She paused for a moment, as if waiting for him to answer. He gurgled, but it wasn't in response to his sister. \"I like that idea too.\" Vada said with a smile. They walked into the kitchen. This was going to be a very easy, non-eventful week for this brother and sister..[Chapter 2] A/N: I'm sorry it's been so long since I've written a chapter! Vada woke up the next morning to Matthew crying in the other room. She stumbled out of bed and walked into the nursery. \"Matthew? Why do you have to get up so early?\" Vada thought to herself as she looked at her brother. Then she looked at the clock next to his crib. It was just a little after five. \"You have to be kidding me. On my summer vacation?\" Vada grabbed Matthew out of the crib and then walked down the stairs to the kitchen. She put him in his high chair. \"Are you hungry Matty?\" He continued to wail. Vada sighed. \"What's the matter with you? Do you need your diaper changed?\" Vada picked him up and felt his pants. She was right. Poor Matthew had soaked his pants overnight. Vada put him on his blanket that lay in the middle of the floor while she went to go get the diaper bag off the kitchen counter. Vada sat down in front of him and changed his diaper. She took the soggy diaper off of him. \"There you go. Don't you feel better now?\" Vada tickled his stomach and he laughed. She stood him up and went to throw the diaper in the trash. She walked back over to him and sat down in front of him. Matthew toddled over to her and hugged her and then sat in her lap. Vada kissed the top of his head. \"Are you ready for breakfast?\" \"Yes.\" Matthew replied smiling. Vada stood up and picked him up and walked over to the table. She put him back in his high chair. When she put a bowl of cereal in front of him, he threw the cereal all over the room and put the bowl on his head. \"Matthew! What are you doing?\" Vada asked and Matthew just laughed. Vada looked at him. She smacked his hand. \"You do not throw cereal. You eat it.\" Matthew started crying and sobbing. \"What have I gotten myself into? How does Shelly live with this every day?\" Vada asked herself. \"I can't call dad, so I have to suck it up and deal with it. I mean it's only for the week right?\"[Chapter 3] The next day there was a knock at the door. Vada walked down the stairs and opened the door. There stood a handsome young man with blonde hair and bright eyes. Vada smiled when she saw him there. \"Nick! How are you? What are you doing here?\" Vada asked. Nick smiled and leaned against the door. \"I heard that your mom and dad took a cruise and I figured you could use some help with your brother.\" Nick replied. \"Thanks Nick. I appreciate it that you'd come all this way just to help me out. How'd you get here anyway?\" Vada asked. Nick looked at her. \"I got a job the last few years and saved up so I would be able to come and see you.\" Nick replied. Vada hugged him. \"That was so sweet of you. I am so glad you came!\" Vada exclaimed. Nick smiled. \"Well, I had something I wanted to talk to you about and I knew that I couldn't put it in a letter. It was something I wanted to do face to face.\" Nick said. \"Do you want to talk about it now?\" Vada asked. Nick nodded no. \"No, we can do it later on. I would like to take you out for dinner.\" Nick replied. Vada looked at him with a funny look on her face. \"What are you talking about?\" Vada asked him. \"I would like to talk to you about this matter over a nice dinner. I have the money if that's what you're worried about.\" Nick responded. Vada crossed her arms and stood in front of Nick. \"Did Uncle Phil put you up to this?\" Vada asked. Nick laughed. \"No, Phil didn't put me up to this. I don't think he even knows I'm here.\" Nick stated. Vada's jaw dropped. \"You ran away from home and came here?\" Vada questioned. \"No, my mom knows I'm here. If she told Phil she did and if she didn't she just didn't. Mom was glad that I decided to come help you. She said that you were a good kid and that she was glad to have you for a niece.\" Nick said. \"Are they married yet?\" Vada asked. Nick sighed. \"Nope. They are still planning on it, but they aren't any more married than they were when you came to visit two years ago.\" Nick said. Vada laughed. \"I don't know about my uncle sometimes. Dad and I love him, but he can be a little-\" Vada paused while trying to think of a nice word to call her uncle. \"Impulsive? Undependable?\" Nick tried. \"Whimsical was more of the word I was thinking of.\" Vada said with a smile. \"Same thing.\" Nick responded. \"Well, let's go find that brother of yours.\" Nick smiled and walked in the door. \"It is okay that I come inside isn't it?\" Vada looked at the floor. \"Oh yes it is. Come on in. Matthew is upstairs.\" Vada said. The phone rang as Vada put her foot on the first step so she walked over to the phone and answered it. \"Hello?\" \"Um yes, Vada? Is Nick there yet?\" A voice asked. Vada looked at Nick. \"Yes Aunt Rose. Nick's here. He just got here.\" Vada replied. \"Good, can I talk to him for a moment please?\" Rose asked. Vada took the phone away from her ear. \"She wants to talk to you.\" Nick rolled his eyes and walked over and took the phone from Vada. \"Yes?\" Nick paused. He sighed. \"I know Ma. I won't get into any trouble. It's Pennsylvania, not Los Angeles.\" Nick paused again. \"Good bye mom.\" He hung up the phone. \"Come on, let's go see that brother of yours.\" Nick smiled and the two of them walked upstairs.[Chapter 4] Nick and Vada sat in a restaurant that night. Vada looked a little nervous. \"What's wrong?\" Nick asked. Vada glanced up at him. \"I… I've just never left Matthew with a baby sitter before.\" Vada said. Nick looked at her and put his hand on her arm. \"Vada, he's not your son. He's your brother. Haven't your parents had sitters before?\" Nick asked. Vada nodded no. \"Shelly said she doesn't want anybody raising her children besides her and dad.\" Vada replied. Nick sighed. \"One night should be okay. He won't constantly be with a baby sitter. Now do you really have to worry about that now?\" Nick asked. \"I have something important I want to talk to you about.\" Vada put her menu down on the table and looked at Nick. \"Please do tell. What is the big deal?\" Vada asked. Nick looked down at the table and his feet. \"Not now.\" Nick mumbled to himself. Vada looked at him. \"Neither of us are going to be able to enjoy ourselves until you get this out in the open, so what's up?\" Vada questioned. Nick glanced up at her. Looking at her beautiful blonde hair and green eyes he smiled. He pulled a small box out of his pocket and held it in front of her. He opened it and Vada saw a small ring laying there. She covered her mouth with her hands and her eyes misted over with tears. \"Nick, are you asking me to marry you? I can't, we're family.\" Vada replied. Nick sighed. \"Two things Vada. One, we aren't family yet. My mom and your Uncle Phil are yet to get married. Two, this isn't an engagement ring.\" Nick stated. Vada looked down at the ring. \"If it's not an engagement ring, what is it?\" Vada wondered. \"It's a promise ring. We are too young to get engaged. This ring promises that you and I will get engaged to be married when we are old enough to get married.\" Nick explained. Vada nodded. Nick leaned over and kissed her. Afterward, he leaned back and looked at her. \"Was that okay?\" \"Yeah, I think it was fine.\" Vada replied and then leaned in and kissed Nick herself. When she leaned back, Nick smiled. \"Is that a yes? Are you promising that we will get engaged when we get older?\" Nick asked. Vada looked right into his eyes with a huge smile. \"Yes.\" Vada replied. \"So…\" Nick paused. \"Do you wanna wear the ring?\" \"Sure.\" Vada put her hand out and Nick slipped the ring on her finger. \"I love you Vada Sultenfuss. I want to marry you and spend the rest of my life with you.\" Nick stated. \"I love you too Nick. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\" They kissed. \"People say we are too young to know what love is, but I think we are just old enough. I'm so glad you came to Pennsylvania.\" \"Me too.\" Nick replied.[Chapter 5] Vada woke up the next morning and went into the bathroom to pick up her toothbrush. When she lifted her hand she saw the silver ring on the third finger of her left hand and she smiled. It wasn't a dream. She truly was going to marry Nick. She brushed her teeth and walked into Matthew's bedroom. Vada picked him up. \"Good morning Matthew. How are you this morning? Good I hope.\" Vada rubbed his head. She walked down the stairs to see Nick sitting in the kitchen eating some cereal. Vada put Matthew in his high chair and got him some food. After she did that she sat down and ate breakfast herself. Nick kept looking between Vada and Matthew and smiled. Vada finally looked at him and laughed. \"What?\" Vada asked. \"I just keep thinking that in about five or six years we could have an infant Matthew's age.\" Nick said. Vada almost choked on her breakfast. \"Nick, he's two. That would mean three years from now. We're only sixteen. That would mean we would have to get married at eighteen to have a child his age by then.\" Vada stated. \"Well, what's wrong with that? I mean if we love each other and we plan to get married anyway. Why not let it be as soon as possible?\" Nick questioned. Vada nodded. \"Nick, we need to talk. I want to go to school. I want to be something in this world.\" Vada explained. Nick looked shocked. \"Don't you think I love you?\" He asked. \"I know you do. But I want to go to school. Shelly and Dad say that I can go to school and make really good grades. My mother was an actress. I want to do something in this world like she did.\" Vada replied. \"Oh.\" Nick looked down at the table and then reached his hand across the table and put his hand on Vada's elbow. \"I know you miss your mom Vada. And I think that wanting to do something like she did is a good thing. If you want to wait, that's what we'll do. As you said, we're only sixteen years old. We have some time before we can get married anyway.\" Nick smiled. Vada put down her spoon and looked at him. \"Where would you want to live?\" Vada asked. \"L.A. of course. My mom and Phil are there.\" Nick replied. Vada looked down at the table, but then back up at Nick. \"What's wrong Vada? Don't you want to live out in California with mom and your uncle?\" \"Yeah, I'd like that.\" Vada paused. She dabbed her eye with her napkin and put it down on the table. \"But my dad, Shelly and Matthew are here in Pennsylvania.\" She sighed and then laughed a little. \"We can't live in two places at once that's crazy. But I don't want my dad or your mom to feel as if we don't want to live near them.\" Nick rubbed Vada's arm. \"Vada, we aren't getting married tomorrow. We have plenty of time to decide where we'll live. Maybe by the time you get out of college we won't want to live in L.A. or here in Pennsylvania. That's something we'll talk about later. Right now, let's just deal with the fact that we're two high school kids who have promised to get engaged and married later in our lives.\" Nick said. Vada sighed and smiled. She looked at him. \"How are you so calm?\" Vada asked. \"I've had more time to think about it, remember? You just found out. I've been planning this since you left to come home two summers ago. I loved you then Vada Sultenfuss and I love you today.\" Nick walked around the table and kissed her. \"Have you told your mom yet?\" Vada asked after they kissed. Nick pulled away and looked at the ground. Vada laughed. \"Nick, we have to tell her some time. She's going to figure it out when we bring home grandchildren at Christmas.\" Nick looked up at her. \"I just don't think right now is a good time to tell them. I don't want to get your dad all worked up and everything. I know he and Phil are brothers; they probably tell each other a lot.\" Nick replied. Vada laughed. \"They're brothers Nick; not girlfriends. Dad hasn't talked to Uncle Phil since I went to see you guys. Mainly because I came back with my ears pierced.\" Vada smiled. She took Nick's hand in hers. \"Besides, I'd like to tell somebody and I think your mom and Uncle Phil will take it better than dad and Shelly.\" \"Even though it's just a promise? We aren't engaged yet?\" Nick asked. Vada nodded. \"Dad freaks out over any little thing that makes me a little less of his little girl. This is definitely a step in that direction and I don't want him coming home from their getaway trip any sooner than they need to.\" Nick nodded. \"I understand that. Do you wanna be the one to call or do you want me to?\" Nick questioned. \"It's your mom. You call her. But I can talk to her after you do.\" Vada replied. Nick looked at her with a bewildered look. \"I don't know about this Vada.\" \"How much do you love me?\" Vada wondered. \"I love you with everything in my heart, mind and soul.\" Nick responded. \"If that's true, why can't you call up your mom and tell her?\" Vada pointed out. \"Good point.\" Nick picked up the phone and sat on the chair in the hallway. Vada leaned against the chair and listened to his breathing. Nick dialed the phone. After three rings Rose answered the phone. \"Hey mom.\" Nick said. \"Well hi Nicholas? Is that you? Where are you calling from?\" Rose asked. \"I'm still at Vada's house. I was calling because Vada and I wanted to talk to you.\" \"Oh? What's wrong? Has something happened? Do Phil and I need to come get you? We can leave on the next plane and get you back home. You better not have done something to hurt Vada.\" Nick can tell by the way Rose's voice dimmed that she wasn't speaking directly into the phone anymore. \"Nick did something to Vada! I told you he shouldn't have gone out there! He's a regular sixteen year old boy.\" \"Mom! I didn't do anything to Vada.\" Nick rebutted. Rose paused. \"Well then what's going on?\" Nick looked at Vada, squeezed her hand and smiled. \"I gave Vada a promise ring. I asked her to become my fiancé and eventually my wife when we get out of school. I know I have a lot of growing up to do, but I know I can do it and I want Vada there with me during that time.\" Rose paused and sighed. \"Nicholas, I don't know what's going on with you. Did you say a promise ring? You know that her father is going to have a major fit about this, or did you even think about anybody but yourself when you went out there? Where did you even get the money? What is a promise ring anyway?\" Rose shot off a lot of questions. \"Mom, I know that it's a lot to take in at one time. But we wanted you and Phil to be the first to know. Vada and I love you, Phil, her parents; but we also love each other and we want to be married when she graduates from college. We've been talking for a while about what we're going to do.\" Nick said. Rose was quiet and never came back on the phone. \"I guess that's all for right now mom if you insist on not talking back to me about it.\" Nick politely hung up the phone. \"I told you it wouldn't be easy.\" Vada smiled. \"I know it wasn't. But you have to admit it was the right thing to do. They deserve to know Nick. I'm glad we told them.\" Vada hugged him.[Chapter 6] A/N: This is probably the quickest I have ever added a chapter to a story; but don't expect too much of it. =D I'm still a busy school oriented college kid. But I do plan on updating more often. Based on my FF notes, this story only has about three chapters left after this one; unless you readers just fall in love with it and want me to write another chapter, which I can do. I just need reviews for that. =) Vada was sitting on the stairs a few hours later when there was somebody knocking on the front door and the doorbell was insensately ringing. \"What is going on? Who could that be?\" Vada thought to herself. \"Hello?\" She called out. Vada stood up and walked over to the door. She looked through the window and saw her Uncle Phil standing there with an angry Aunt Rose. \"Vada, open the door.\" Uncle Phil said calmly. Vada took in a deep breath and put her hand on the locked doorknob. She knew that Nick was just upstairs with Matthew and she didn't want something bad to happen. Vada unlocked the door and opened it. Rose barged in and Phil stood next to Vada. He was cool and calm, where Rose looked like a bottle of ketchup. \"Where is he?\" Rose demanded looking at Vada. \"I know he's here! I can't believe he would put you in this kind of a situation Vada! I'm just so mad at him!\" Phil walked over and tried to calm her down. \"Rose, remember what we talked about on the plane? We weren't going to get upset? We were going to talk to Nick and Vada like adults?\" Phil asked. Rose glared up at him. \"Don't patronize me.\" Vada cleared her throat. \"He- he's upstairs Aunt Rose.\" Vada stated. Rose looked at her and smiled slightly. \"Thank you Vada.\" Rose said. \"NICHOLAS!\" A few minutes later, Nick came flying down the stairs. \"Mom! What are you doing here?\" Nick asked. \"I can't believe that you didn't talk to me about this before you left. I wouldn't have let you come if I would have known.\" Rose exclaimed. Nick looked down at the floor and put his hands in his pockets. \"I know. That's why I didn't tell you.\" Nick mumbled. \"Why didn't you say something Nick? I could have helped you.\" Phil said patiently. \"Look, it's only a promise ring. We aren't even engaged yet. We just said that we would get engaged when we graduated high school.\" Nick said in a half yell. \"Young man, you should have talked to somebody before you just up and decide to fly across the country to ask a girl you met one time to marry you.\" Rose exploded. Nick looked at the floor and didn't say anything. \"If I may say something-\" Phil started to say and then paused. Rose looked up at him. \"Go ahead and say it. I know you probably don't agree with me. Let's hear it.\" Rose said angrily. \"Rose, I agree that these kids shouldn't be getting married. They are only sixteen. Yet, they aren't getting engaged. I think we should sit down and talk about it before anybody goes haywire.\" Phil said. \"I think that's a good idea Uncle Phil.\" Vada replied with a nod. \"Thank you Vada.\" Phil responded. They walked into the family room and sat down. \"Okay Nick. What are you kids thinking about? This is crazy. I never thought of you as the kind of person to run off and do something like this.\" \"Maybe you don't know me as well as you thought you did Phil.\" Nick said. \"Look, we flew all the way out here, we are going to sit and talk about this. You kids can't get married anyway. Not without her parents' permission and ours.\" Phil stated. \"We don't want to get married yet. We just want to say that we'll get married in the future. Vada and I weren't planning on running off and getting married. I know that I can't take care of her right now. She wants to go to college and be somebody instead of just a wife and mother. She wants to have a career like her mom did.\" Phil smiled at her. \"Your mom was a wonderful person Vada. You are so much like her.\" Phil stated. Vada smiled. Rose was finally calming down. \"So you guys really aren't considering jumping the boat and getting married tonight?\" Rose asked. \"No mom.\" Nick looked up at Vada. \"I told you that telling them was going to be a bad idea.\" Vada nodded. \"You did. I just didn't realize that it'd be this bad. Now I am glad that we didn't tell my dad because it would be so much worse.\" \"Wait, so you didn't tell your dad?\" Rose asked looking at Vada suspiciously. \"No, of course not.\" Vada replied. Rose sighed. \"Oh! That's another thing that makes me feel better then. Well, then. I guess it's all settled for now. Vada, can you show me where I can put my bags? We got a one way ticket and I'd like to see some of this beautiful state you live in before I leave. It's so quiet here. Much better than L.A. I may have to move here.\" Rose smiled. \"Sure.\" Vada stood up and she and Rose walked towards the stairs. Phil looked at Nick. \"What would you have done if we wouldn't have shown up Nick?\" Phil asked. Nick shrugged. \"Same thing I guess. I would have come home in a few days and I would have waited until I graduated to ask Vada's dad for her hand in marriage. Then we would have gotten married once she got out of college.\" Nick said. \"I'm glad to hear it. We'll all be staying here until Shelly and Harry get back.\" Phil said. Nick swallowed hard. \"We will? Why?\" \"To tell them the good news of course.\" Phil put his hand on Nick's back and patted it twice before walking out of the room.[Chapter 7] A/N: Well it's been almost two months. I think I've left you in suspense long enough. =) Chapter Seven! A little while later, Phil was upstairs in Harry and Shelly's bedroom. He had the phone in hand when he sat on the bed. He dialed and waited for somebody to answer. After three rings, Shelly answered the phone. \"Vada? Is everything alright?\" Shelly asked. \"It's not Vada, Shelly. It's Phil.\" Phil stated. \"What's going on Phil? Harry is in the shower right now. We were about to head to dinner.\" Shelly said. \"Rose and I are here with Vada, Nick and Matthew. Apparently Nick has come to Pennsylvania to ask Vada to marry him.\" \"What? They are sixteen!\" Shelly exclaimed. \"I know Shel. Rose and I have it under control. We just wanted to let you guys know.\" Phil said. \"Who's on the phone?\" Phil heard Harry ask. He cringed. Harry tended to blow a lot out of proportion. \"It's Phil, Harry. Now don't overreact. Vada and Nick have been talking a lot lately. He went over to the house a while ago.\" \"What?\" Harry hollered. \"Now Harry, calm down.\" \"Calm down? My daughter is out there cavorting with some Californian guy and you are telling me to calm down? Believe me this is calm compared to when I get ahold of Vada!\" Shelly sighed. \"Give me the phone.\" Phil heard Harry grab the phone. \"Why didn't you stop her?\" Harry asked angrily. Phil took a breath. \"Harry, I didn't realize that Vada and Nick were going to be together until they called us. We have it handled. It's fine.\" Phil stated. \"I'm sure you have, but we're still coming home immediately.\" Harry exclaimed. He hung up abruptly. Phil put down the phone. Harry had been Phil's brother for years, why was he surprised that Harry was acting this way now?[Chapter 8] A/N: Well obviously I didn't make it to my Valentine's deadline; but this story is going to be finished today. I hope you enjoy the last two chapters with no disappointment. =) A few days later, Nick, Vada, Rose, Phil and Matthew were eating lunch when Harry and Shelly rush in. Harry went over and grabbed Nick by the collar. \"Leave my daughter alone!\" Harry exclaimed. \"Dad,\" Vada stood up. \"What is with you?\" Vada asked. Shelly touched her shoulders, bus she wrenched away. Then rushed out of the room. \"Vada.\" Shelly called out, and didn't get a reply. \"Harry, don't worry about Nick. He's going home with us.\" Rose stated glaring at Nick. Nick stood up and walked away from the table. \"It was only a promise ring! We aren't getting married tomorrow or anything.\" Nick walked towards the door. \"I knew Vada shouldn't have called. She wanted to do this right and talk to all of you. I told her we should wait. She didn't believe me.\" Nick walked out of the kitchen. He walked into the other room and saw Vada sitting on the stairs. He went over to her. \"I'm sorry Nick. I didn't mean for all of this to blow up. I'm sure it'll blow over soon.\" Vada put her face in her hands. Nick sat next to her. \"It's not your fault Vada. If they can't accept us, it's not our fault. We aren't getting married right now.\" He took her hand. \"That's a promise ring not an engagement ring or a wedding ring. We promised we would get engaged at a later time after high school.\" Nick kissed her. \"I love you Vada Sultenfuss. I have for two years. I always will. Ever since you left L.A; I realized I couldn't live my life without you.\" Vada laughed. \"Nick, we were fourteen years old.\" Vada replied. \"I know, and I said I'd do anything to be with you.\" Nick said and kissed her again.[Chapter 9] Shelly, Harry, Rose and Phil walked into the front room. \"Come on Nicholas, we are going home.\" Rose said. Nick stood up. \"Mom, what do you mean we're going home?\" Nick asked. \"You, Phil and I are leaving to head home now.\" Rose grabbed him by the ear. \"OW!\" Nick hollered. \"Mom.\" \"Don't \"mom\" me Nicholas. We are going home. End of story.\" Rose said. Phil gave Nick a look that said, \"Don't argue with your mom. You won't win.\" Harry looked at Vada. \"You…\" Harry started to say. \"Go to your room. We will have a talk later. Vada stood up, but didn't walk up the stairs. She stood frozen on the steps. \"Now Vada!\" Harry barked. He used a tone Vada never usually messed with. Today wasn't an exception. Vada went up to her bedroom. Harry glared at Nick. \"You.\" Harry paused. \"I never want you to go anywhere near my daughter again.\" \"That will never happen. I really love your daughter.\" Nick said. \"Oh yeah. I'm not sure you even know what that truly means. You are sixteen years old.\" Harry replied. \"Come on Nicholas. We have a plane to catch.\" Rose stated as they walked out. [ Vada was standing at the window when she saw Nick, Phil and Rose walk out of the house. As Vada looked out the window she heard footsteps outside her door. The door was swooshed open to show an angry Harry and a worried Shelly. \"What were you thinking Vada? Are you crazy? I trusted you to watch your little brother and this is how you repay me?\" Harry asked. Shelly walked over and wrapped her arms around Vada's shoulders. \"Harry, she's in love. Leave her alone. Yes, maybe it wasn't the smartest idea; but nothing bad happened.\" Shelly responded. \"Stay out of this Shelly. This is between me and my daughter.\" Harry said sternly. Shelly looked at him with surprise. She backed down and walked over to the door and then out of the room. \"Dad, I.\" Vada started to say. Harry raised his arm. \"Stop. I don't want to hear anything. How could you do this? Vada Sultenfuss, I trusted you! How could you be so irresponsible? You are never to see him again! I forbid it! I mean it Vada!\" Harry screamed. Vada fell on the bed and didn't say anything. She was holding back her emotions. They wouldn't help her now. Not with her father's anger the way it was. \"I can't even talk to you right now, I'm so upset. We will talk about this later Vada.\" Harry said and with that he stormed out of the bedroom. Tears started flowing out of the corner of Vada's eyes. Then she looked down to see the promise ring still on her hand. Vada realized even if her father kicked Nick out of the house, he could never take away her promise. That she would keep close to her heart. Always.[Chapter 10] A/N: Well, we have all been waiting, wondering what would be in store for Nick and Vada (myself included); so it's time to unveil the final chapter and end this chapter in these teenagers lives and wait for the next chapter to begin (metaphorically speaking) After several days of sulking and crying Vada finally came out of her bedroom. She was sixteen and knew it wasn't healthy to not eat, but she was just too worked up to eat. Shelly has come to see her a few times, but Vada refused to listen to her. \"Why should I do anything for dad after he threw Nick out?\" Vada asked. Shelly sighed and shrugged her arms. \"Vada, he was only doing what he thought was best. Granted it wasn't; but he thought it was.\" Shelly said and paused. \"None of us were sure what to do, sweetheart. We were on our cruise when we get a distressed call from your Uncle Phil that said you're engaged. We were in unchartered territory here.\" Vada sighed loudly and held up her ring. \"This is a PROMISE ring. Not an engagement ring. Sheesh.\" Vada exclaimed. \"We're sixteen. Do you honestly think I'd get married at sixteen?\" \"Not me, but your father worries.\" Shelly stated. \"I don't know if and when I'll ever hear from Nick again. He probably won't even want to see me again.\" Vada said. Shelly walked over and sat behind her on the bed. She hugged her step daughter closely. \"Vada, you are a beautiful and wonderful young lady. Nothing will ever change that. What Nick saw before he will still see. You aren't going to change just because of your father. Come on, maybe some time we can talk to him.\" The doorbell rang getting Shelly and Vada's attention. \"Who is that?\" Vada asked. \"I don't know. Probably somebody for your father. In his line of work he sees a lot of people.\" Shelly stated. Then, there was a knock on Vada's door. Harry was standing there. \"Shelly, can you come here please?\" He asked. Shelly stood up and walks out of the room without another word. Harry looked at Vada. \"Are you still not speaking to me?\" He questioned. Vada looked down at the bed without answering him. \"You're acting like a child Vada. I expected more from you. You're the one who was telling me how mature and grown up you were.\" Harry started to walk away. The anger started to bottle up inside of Vada and her blood boiled but she didn't say a word. [ When Shelly got downstairs, she saw Nick sitting in the parlor. \"Nick! What are you doing here?\" Shelly asked. He stood up. \"I'm here to speak to you about Vada. We had a misunderstanding that I should have corrected but didn't.\" By this time, Harry was standing next to Shelly and Vada was standing on the staircase out of sight. \"Mr. Sultenfuss, I'm here to do something I should have a long time ago.\" Nick sighed. \"I may only be sixteen but I love Vada, very much so. I don't want to marry her right now like you all, my mom and Phil thought. I still have several years in school and I want Vada to go to college. I just wanted to tell her how I feel now so she didn't find somebody else.\" Nick said. \"So you aren't trying to rush marriage?\" Harry questioned and Nick snorted. \"Of course not!\" Nick exclaimed. \"Now I should be going. I just wanted to clear the air.\" \"You came all this way just for that? Don't you want to see Vada or something before you go?\" Shelly asked, not realizing that she was on the stairs. Nick looked straight at Vada. \"She knows how I feel about her. We're both glad the air has been cleared.\" Nick replied. Vada smiled at him as he walked towards the door and she knew that now everything she wanted was going to happen. Nick had come back for her. He loved her enough to come on the way back to Pennsylvania for her and it felt good. Now she knew why she loved him and just how much he loved her. It was an amazing feeling she knew would never go away. She smiled all the way back up to her bedroom. She shut the door behind her. Vada leaned up against it and sighed joyfully. She never ever wanted to lose this feeling again. The End For Real This Time ","Summary":" Harry Sultenfuss walked down the stairs of his Pennsylvania home. his daughter Vada was right behin"},{"Movie":"My Girl","Title":"One Last Chance","Author":"Golden Snitch1981","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4805642","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It's been three months sincenThomas J was stung by all the bees. I remember how sad my Dad wasnwhen he broke the news to me. I know it must have been the hardestnfuneral he had ever had to co-ordinate. I knew Shelly was a wrecknwhen she had to do his make-up, although both she and my dad triednvery hard not to show it. I know they understand that he was my verynbest friend in this whole world. He was my only friend and now he isndead. I'm not mad at them in anyway, really I'm not. I just wish Thomas J was here. Henwould comfort me through this, but he isn't. He is gone and I amnstill here missing him like crazy. I know I have Judy as a friend,nshe is the only one in my class who cared that Thomas J was takennfrom me, but it isn't the same as having Thomas J by my side,nclimbing trees, fishing and squirting water. Judy doesn't like anynof those things and that's okay. I think I would feel weirdnclimbing trees with Judy. That was Thomas J's thing. I don't think anyone really knowsnhow much I miss Thomas J or how guilty I feel that Thomas J diednwhile finding my mood ring, right after he had kissed me and asked mento think of him if I don't get to marry Mr. Bixler. Like he wasnsome sort of consolation prize I told Thomas J I would and he rodenaway looking so happy and I hadn't given him a second thought. Nownthat he is where my mother is, in heaven, the place no one ever camenback from, I wish I could see him again and tell him how much henmeans to me as my best friend in the whole world. Shelly says henalready knows does he?[Chapter 2] I wrote a poem for Thomas Jnyesterday and today I want to read in front of the writing class.nThat also means I'll have to read it in front of Mr. Bixler, butnthat's okay. I know Thomas J would want me to do it. Things havenbeen awkward since the day of Thomas J's funeral when I ran awaynand told Mr. Bixler that I loved him. I cringe every time I think ofnit, especially how he had calmly listened, before Joann waltzed out.nShe was dressed for the funeral, even though she never knew Thomas J.nNo one knew Thomas J like I did. No one tried to. I haven't been back to the writingnclass since that day. The last time I tried I only reached as far asnthe doors of the school building. I feel awkward every time I thinknof Mr. Bixler. Today though I know I need to do this for Thomas J asnwell as for me. Today I am going to ride my bike over to the school,npark it at the bottom of the steps and march up them, into thenbuilding and I won't stop until I am standing in front of thatnreading my poem for Thomas J. Shelly says I'm so brave the way Inam dealing with his death. I don't feel brave right now. Not atnall. I wish Thomas J were here to help me. He would ride with me tonthe school and he would wait for me, I know he would. He always camento the doctor's surgery whenever I thought something was wrong withnmy prostate or I could feel the chicken bone that I swore was lodgednin my throat. I know he would have been there the day I thought Infelt the bee stings. It won't be the same, but maybenJudy will ride with me to school and wait for me while I read mynpoem. Judy and I are really good friends. She is so different nownthat she doesn't associate with those girls who teased Thomas J andnme. I don't what happened between her and those girls that made hernstop being friends with them. Maybe it was because of me or maybe shenfound out they only liked her because her dad owned a movie theatre.nNow we are going to be in the same homeroom at Junior High. I wondernif Thomas J would be in my homeroom, too if he was here. School surenis going to be weird without him.[Chapter 3] I am standing in front of an adultnwriting class, reading my poem for Thomas J. I am nervous especiallynknowing that three feet away, Mr Bixler is watching me like a hawk. Insee Joann is there and I momentarily freeze. I'm sure they thinknit's because of Thomas J that I falter and maybe that's a bignpart of it, but it's really because of her and him .nIt's supposed to marry Mr. Bixler and live with him and not my dad,nnot Joann. I wish Thomas J was here, he was thenonly one who knew how much I love Mr. Bixler. He would know hownscared and confused I am right now. I look around the room at Justinnand Rhonda and everyone else who I had pet in this class. I see themnnod at me with encouragement. I look in the back and see Thomas Jnstanding there smiling. He's here? He's really here? I looknagain. He is here! I am more confident as I read knowing that ThomasnJ really can here my poem. Maybe God made a mistake and sentnhim back, knowing how much I need him here with me. I can't waitnuntil I can hug him and tell him how much I love him and miss him. Incan't wait to take him down to the river bed and swing off thenwillow with him again. My best friend my blood brother is back! Infinish my poem and everyone applauds me. I look up and every face innthe room has tears streaming down. I would cry too, but I don'tnwant Thomas J to see me cry. Why should I, he's here! I look overnto where he is standing, but he is gone. I run from the room as tearsnnow fall. Oh, Thomas J, Why couldn't you wait so I can talk to you?[Chapter 4] I am riding bikes with Judy. Itnseems that's the only thing she and Thomas J would have had inncommon. I haven't told Judy about seeing Thomas J in the classroom,nwhile I was reading the poem and how he vanished just as quickly asnhe appeared. I don't want my new friend to think I'm crazy. Wouldnshe tell people in our class if I was crazy? I didn't know but Inwasn't willing to take the chance. \"Hey, look Vada! No feet!\" Inhear his voice behind me and I look over my shoulder to see if it'snreally him. There his is with his legs sticking out, a big proud grinnon his face. \"Wow Thomas J! Real Evil Kenevel!\"nI call out to him just like old times. I am kicking myself, wonderingnif I have hurt him. Did I used to hurt him when I said things likenthat? Thomas J just smiles and continues to peddle, happily. He isnstanding up on his peddles and catching up to me now. He is strongernthan I have ever known him to be. \"Vada, did you just saynsomething?\" Judy is looking at me weird. I realize it is she who isnasking me if I have said something to her. With a shake of my head Inam reassuring her that no, I definitely didn't say something. Notnto her anyway. She's turned her face forward and is riding ahead.n\"First one home is a rotten egg!\" I am letting her go, happy tonjust ride along with Thomas J by my side, just like old times.[Chapter 5] ThomasnJ and I spend the afternoon together, climbing the big Willow by thenwater's edge. \"Hey Vada, do you think I'll make a good acrobat?\"nHe asking me as he jumps off a branch and patches onto another tonbreak the fall. Unlike before, he does not fall. His grip is strong. \"Inthink you would have.\" I smile as I watch a grin break accrossnhis angelic face. I do a doubletake, noticing Thomas J isn't wearingnhis reading glasses. ThomasnJ never left home without his glasses. He was almost blind withoutnthem. The day of his funeral was the first time I have seen Thomas Jnwithout them. That day had been painful. How could the adults haventaken away his glasses? He needs them to see - well I thought he did.nMaybe they fixed his eyes when he was in Heaven. \"Thomas J, cannyou see without your glasses?\" I ask him as I am swinging ontonthe branch he is hanging off it.\" He lets go and lands on thenground, squarely on his feet. I study his blue-green eyes as he looksnup at me. I never noticed before how pretty they are. \"Ofncourse I can, Vada. Isn't it great?\" I nod in agreement. I admitnit is weird seeing him without them. I land on the ground in front ofnhim, although not as gracefully as he did. I am sitting where I landnrubbing my elbow in attempt to soothe the searing pain. Thomas J isncrouching beside me with his hand on my bleeding elbow. It tingles asnthe bleeding stops and I stare at my best friend in amazement. Hensmiles and takes his hand way. \"ThomasnJ, do you remember the day we kissed?\" I can't believe I amnasking him this. \"YesnVada,\" he answers. \"Then I found your mood ring.\" Inlook away and my eyes mist over. I can't let him see me cry. \"Yes,nThomas, that day,\" I say to him. I don't think he realizes whatnhas happened to him. I don't want to be the one to tell him the beesnkilled him. I look at the ring on my stone is now glowingnblue. \"Can I kiss you you again, Thomas I?\" Withoutnanother word from either of us, we lean in together, with our eyesnclosed and our lips touch. Suddenly the warmth of his lips isnreplaced by a cool summer breeze. Open my eyes to see that Thomasnisn't there. Once again, my best friend is gone.[Chapter 6] Inhaven't seen Thomas J since that day under the willow tree. I toldnShelly about the time I spent. When I talk about him she just smilesnand tells me its great to have memories. How do I tell her that theynaren't just memories. ThomasnJ was back wasn't he? He did ride bikes with Judy and me and climbnthe willow didn't he? Have I just imagined him kissing me beneath it? I'venhad Alot of quiet days in my room lately. These are the times I thinknabout him and wonder if I am going crazy seeing him again. He reallynwas with me all of those times, I just know it. If he can come backnfrom Heaven to visit me, why hasn't my mother? I used to think I wasnthe one killed her. I know now that I didn't. Dad reassured me ofnthat but does she believe it? Maybe mom thinks its my fault she'sngone. Inflip the radio on and Wedding Bell Blues fills my bedroom and I laynon my bed thinking of the last time I heard it. Insearch for my class picture with the heart drawn around Me.\"nBixler's face. I run my finger accross the faces in the front rownuntil I find Thomas J, smiling his crooked smile as he stares at thencamera. A single tear falls onto the glass frame and trickles downntowards the edge. \"Inmiss you so much, Thomas.\" I am sobbing. Infeel a hand on my shoulder. Expecting to see Dad or Shelly, I amnsurprised to see him standing there, his blond hair glistening in thensunlight. \"I'mnhere, Vada,\" he whispers. I can't help smiling as I leap up tonhug him. \"You'renback,\" I exclaim with joy. \"Innever left.\" He reassures me. Incan hear Shelly calling me for dinner. \"Coming!\" I answer.n\"Would you like to stay for dinner?\" He nods. Bounding downnthe stairs I bellow, \"Thomas J is staying for dinner, too!\" WhennI reach through kitchen Dad, Shelly, uncle Phil and Gramoo are all innstunned silence. Can they see him, too? \"Vada,nThomas J is gone, sweetheart,\" Dad says. Shelly nudges him innthe ribs. \"He'snhere, Dad. Can't you see him? He's right beside me.\" Shelly'sneyes are listing up as she looks at me sadly. Inlook over at Thomas J, who is confused. \"Why can't they see me?\"nhe asks. Inshrug, feeling hopeless. \"I don't know.\" \"Vada,nthis isn't funny.\" Dadnsays sternly. \"Inknow its not. Why can't you see him?\" I am crying withnfrustration. \"Becausenhe's gone, Vada.\" Dad says. Inpull out an empty chair and Thomas J sits down at the table. I thennsit in my place beside him. I don't understand it.\" Why am I thenonly one who can see Thomas J?[Chapter 7] Dad, Shelly and Uncle Phil arenstaring at me with a mixture of intrigue and horror, as Thomas and Ingiggle our way through dinner. \"Hey Vada! Do you like seafood?\"nThomas J asks with a mouthful of peas. I remember this joke. It'snthe one I told Shelly at the Fourth of July Barbeque. I smile before answering hisnriddle, \"Yeah, Thomas J.\" I like See food and with my ownnmouthful of peas I stick my tongue out at him. \"See?\" \"Vada, that's disgusting,\" myndad says, looking stern and a little green. I can't help but gigglenagain, as dad returns to his dinner, gingerly taking anothernmouthful. Shelly is chuckling to herself as she takes another bite ofnher steak, before winking at me. Uncle Phil is quietly chomping awaynat his steak, careful not to say anything to add to the drama, but Incan tell he is amused. Gramoo however begins to hum softlynto herself, rocking backwards and forwards in her chair. She isnstaring straight at Thomas J, smiling softly. Is it possible that shencan see him, too? She's reaching across the table for Thomas J'snhand. \"It's so lovely to have you join us, young man,\" shensays. She's taking his hand in hers and is squeezing it. Dad dropsnhis fork in shock. It lands on the plate with a clang. \"Vada, stop this nonsense rightnnow!\" he yells while Shelly tries to calm him down. It's no use.nHe is livid as he shrugs away from Shelly. \"This has gone farnenough! You've upset Gramoo. Is that what you want?\" I am too mad to speak. I slam mynknife and fork down on my plate and I stand, pushing my chair away.n\"I hate you!\" I cry. Tears are streaming down my cheeks. \"Comenon, Thomas J.\" He follows behind me as I storm up the stairs to mynroom. I don't stop until I reach my room. I slam the the door and Inam now flinging myself on my bed. Thomas J watches me with sad eyes.n\"Why can't they see you, Thomas J?\" I am screaming at him. \"Whyncan't they see you when I can? Gramoo can see you, so why can'tnDad or Shelly?\" Thomas J just shrugs. I can hear a light tapping on myndoor. \"Vada, come out.\" Shelly's voice is barely audible overnmy sobs. \"No!\" I sob. \"Well can I come in?\" she asks. \"No! Go away!\" I scream. I feelna little bad for yelling at Shelly. She's really nice and she'snreally good for my Dad, but right now I don't want to know any ofnthem, including Shelly. \"Okay,\" I can hear her sigh.n\"I'm here when you're ready.\" The sound of her footsteps fadenas she walks away from my door and back down the stairs. I look around for Thomas J, but oncenagain, he is gone. Why does he keep doing that? Why does he alwaysndisappear? I dig out War and Peace and I begin to read. For once Incan lose myself in something enough to forget my sadness. I don'tnrealize I've fallen asleep until I wake up later to the sound ofnDad and Shelly's voices. \"…She's just grieving, Harry.\"nShelly said. \"It hasn't been that long agao, when Thomas J…\" \"This isn't Vada, Grieving. It'snanother one of her games of pretend.\" He retorted. His voice isnshaking. \"And what if it is just pretend,nwhat can it hurt? I don't think that's it though. Maybe she canntruly see him. Gramoo obviously saw something.\" She said. Shenbelieves me! \"Ooh, spooky, Shelly.\" I cannjust see him rolling his eyes. \"You know how Gramoo's mindnwonders. I work with the dead, but I have never had anyone return.nNot even Maggie came back. What makes you think they come back?\" \"It wouldn't be the first time,nyou know.\" Their voices are fading in the distance as I listen tonthem close their bedroom door. I roll over as fresh tears arenbeginning to fall. Am I imagining Thomas J when he is here? If so,nwhy can Gramoo see him, too?[Chapter 8] I've decided to visit Mrs Sennetntoday. She told me I could visit her when ever I want, but I haven'tnsee her since she gave me the Mood ring. Her voice was so shakey thatnday and I could tell she was about to cry. I had told her that my momnwould take care of Thomas J and I think she found some comfort innthat. I guess, like me though, she'll never stop missing him. DoesnThomas go visit his mother when he disappears? My mind is racing a mile a minute asnI fetch my bike from the garage. While I'm in there I can't helpnremembering the day I lost my streamer. It was the same day Shellynput makeup on my face and I was trying to act like a lady should. Itnturned out so badly that I gave up. I had measured his head withnGramoo's criminology chart and told him he had no personality. Itnwas the day that I had found a picture of my Mom and Dad in front ofnour house. I pull the crumpled photo out of mynpocket and I am staring at it remembering Thomas J. and I talkingnabout Heaven. We didn't think much of it, then. I guess we didn'tnrealize how soon Thomas J would wind up going there. I longed to asknhim if there really were white horses in Heaven. I will if I see himnagain. I haven't seen him since that night at dinner. Did my Dadnscare him off. I climb on my bike and peddle out ofnthe garage and down the street to the Sennet house. I park my bike innthe front yard and I am walking up their steps, looking around innawe. Nothing has change here. It's almost like he hasn't gone. Inremember meeting him here and sneaking off together to spy on Dad andnShelly at the Bingo. He was worried about his parents catching himnand I had called him a bed-wetter. I think he went with me that nightnto stop me from calling him names. Was I really that mean to him? Inknock lightly on the door and Mrs. Sennet answers. She is lookingnvery thin and I can tell she has been crying. She is wiping her sadneyes. \"Hi, Vada. It's good to see you again.\" She forces ansmile. \"Come in.\"[Chapter 9] I step inside the dark Sennet homenand Mrs. Sennet closes that door behind us. \"Would you like somenlemonade?\" she asks me. I can tell she is hoping I say yesnso I nod. \"Thank you, Mrs. Sennet.\" \"Thomas J loves – I mean –nloved Lemonade.\" She said. Her eyes are brimming with a fresh wellnof tears. I follow her into the kitchen. It is not how I remember it.nThe dishes, usually non existent, are piled high and bread crumbs arensprinkled across the bench top in front of an old toaster. The butternis melting in the summer heat and there is a hint of it on a silvernbutter knife. I take a seat on a stool and watchnMrs. Sennet clumsily pour the lemonade into a glass with shakennhands. Then she pours another for her self, before handing the firstnglass to me. She is now making herself comfortable on another stool.n\"So how have you been, Vada. You must be about to start Junior Highnthis year, are you?\" Without a clue what else to say, I nod.n\"Thomas J would have been in Junior this year too.\" I nod again.nHe would have been in my class. Now he will not. \"Mrs. Sennet, do ever see ThomasnJ?\" I am blurting out, mentally kicking myself for it. A look ofnshock crosses her face but it turns to sadness. She shakes her head. \"I wish Incould. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of himnconstantly.\" The woman begins to search for a Kleenex. She'snfound one and is wiping her eyes with it. \"I'm sorry Vada. I'mnstill such a mess, now that he's gone.\" \"I see him sometimes.\" I amnblurting out. Again I wonder if I am saying the right thing. \"Really? It's good to havenmemories, Vada. Thomas J loved you, you know. You were his bestnfriend.\" I am nodding vigerously. \"I miss him, but I've seen him.nHe is so much better, now. His bee stings don't hurt anymore and hencan see perfectly with out his glasses.\" I am chattering away and Indon't notice Mrs. Sennet turn white. Her eyes are wide and she isnstunned. \"He's gone Vada. I wish we couldnsee him, but he's gone.\" So she can't see him either. \"I wish you could see me, Mom.\"nThomas J's voice is heard suddenly. \"Vada, why can't she seenme?\" \"I don't know, Thomas J.\" Mrs.nSennet is distraught. \"Get out!\" she is crying. Instand up, stunned. \"Get out! Get out! Get out!\" \"I'm sorry, Mrs Sennet,\" Insay, realizing I've upset her too much. \"Get out!\" she screams again andnI bolt through the front hall and out to my bike. I am crying as Inkick the stand away and begin to peddle furiously. Where can I co? Incan't go home, like this. My dad will be mad and Shelly will worry.nSo I go to the only place I find comfort.[Chapter 10] As I flee the Sennet house, Inrealize Thomas J is back by my side again. Does he think it's angame, appearing and disappearing when he chooses to? He was at hisnmother's wasn't he? Why didn't he show himself to her? Why justnme? He saw how upset she was! I am sobbing on the pier beside thenweeping willow. My tears dropping into the calm rippling water. Inremember when we became blood brothers on this very pier, the day wenwent fishing and I couldn't bear to see the fish die. I hatedndeath, even then. I hate it still, even more since it took Thomas J.nWhy do kids get taken, while the old, like Gramoo suffer, waiting tonbe taken? Thomas J gently took the fish offnthe hook after I had screamed it him not to kill the fish. He hadndropped the now limp fish back into the river. \"Did it get away?\"nI had asked him and he nodded, not looking at me. \"He got away,\" he had said, innthat tone he always used when he was lying. \"I was trying to protect you, younknow.\" Thomas J's small voice broke into my thoughts. \"I didn'tnwant to see you cry. You see death all the time, when they wheel themninto your Dad's house and I know it scares you.\" I am wiping my tears away with thenback of my arm. Thomas J always thought of me, even when I wasn'tnthinking of him. He thought of me the day we went to the doctor'snsurgery and the receptionist had given him a cool water gun. He hadnmade sure I would get one to. \"It doesn't scare me so muchnanymore. It just makes me sad.\" When I look into Thomas J's eyesnI can tell he understands. Why can't anyone else? Shelly tries butnI can tell she doesn't. \"Thomas J, why can't your Momnsee you?\" I ask him. He just shakes his head. \"I wish I knew.\" We sit by the brook in silence untilnthe sun goes down and its time to go home. I am starving, but thenthought of eating with the Sultonfusses again made my stomach churn,nremembering how the last one went. When I get home, I'm goingnstraight to my room. Maybe later I'll sneak downstairs and makenmyself a Peanut-butter and Jelly sandwich.[Chapter 11] As soon as I walk through my frontndoor, I see Dad and Shelly there waiting for me and I know there'snno chance of sneaking up to my room. Dad's face is red and I canntell he is livid. \"Why did you have to upset Mrs.nSennet, like that? Hasn't she been through enough?\" There he goesnagain, worrying about everyone else's pain and ignoring mine. I hadngone there to talk to her, not upset her. How was I to know she can'tnsee Thomas J, like I can? Can everyone who can see Thomas J, pleasenraise their right hand? I told Dad my intentions of visitingnMrs. Sennet – well tried to, but he continued to yell at me until Inam standing in the front hall in tears. I can't be bothered holdingnthem, not for the sake of hiding my pain from the one person who isnsupposed to care about me the most. Who am I kidding? He doesn'tncare at all. I bet he blames me for my mother's death even thoughnhe told me different. I bet he wishes it was me who died, not hisnMaggie. I don't have the strength tonpretend I'm okay, so I let my tears fall in a stream. I am sobbingnuncontrollably, while my Dad continues to tear strips off of me,noblivious to the obvious state I am in. Shelly, whose face creasednwith concern, tries to comfort me, but I shrug her away. It's notnher comfort I want. I want my Dad to tell me I'm not crazy fornseeing my dead best friend, when no one else can, and that everythingnwill be alright. His harsh words, his angry tone andnShelly's attempts to console me all become too much. \"LEAVE MEnALONE!\" I scream, dodging the pair of them and dashing up thenstairs. \"Vada! Come back here!\" My Dadnis shouting at me, but I am beyond caring. I slam my door, turn mynradio up to full volume and fling myself onto my bed. Wedding BellnBlues is playing and I let the lyrics seep into my mind, while myntears continue to fall.[Chapter 12] Stick with me, this one's almost finsished. Don't be sad. I'll write another story, when I get more ideas. Shelly is rapping on my door \"Please let me in! Vada, open the door!\" Her voice is wavering. Is she crying? It doesn't matter. I don't want her help. \"Go Away!\" I yell, but this time she is persistent. She raps on the door again. \"Come on, Vada! Please let me talk to you!\" I can hear my Dad yelling something about me being stubborn, from downstairs. \"You shouldn't have yelled at her! She needs help, Harry! Can't you see she's upset?\" I can't deny Shelly does care, but I'm still not going to let her in. \"Vada, if it means anything to you, I believe you!\" This stuns me into silence. She believes me? Someone believes me? It's not Dad, but Shelly can always convince Dad of anything! Maybe she can help me convince Dad that I really can see Thomas J. I stand and walk over to the door. I've barely opened it and Shelly is rushing in, enveloping me in one of her bear-hugs. She's not letting go, and at this point, I don't care. I am glad someone, even if its not Dad, cares enough to help me. I am sobbing. Shelly is combing her fingers through my hair, \"Its okay. Just let it out. Cry as much as you need to. I'm here.\" I remain there for a few minutes but then I pull away. \"Why doesn't my Dad care?\" I ask Shelly. \"He does, Vada. He just doesn't know how to show it. He doesn't know how to help,\" Shelly explains. \"He could, not yell at me, for a start.\" I say. I've gone from openly sobbing to sullen, my eyes drying up rapidly. \"He could listen to me for a change. He could take my side for a change.\" \"It's not about sides, Vada. You upset Mrs. Sennet, today.\" She is not angry and I am relieved. \"I know I did, but I didn't mean to. I was just –,\" I began. \"I know you didn't mean to. You were just crying out for help, or a bit understanding from someone who misses Thomas J as much as you do, if not more.\" Shelly continued. She was right. That was what I was looking for. \"It's okay to see someone, after they have passed. You aren't crazy. I hope you know that.\" My eyes widen. \"I'm not?\" \"Of course not, but please, Vada, don't be upset with people who can't see Thomas J, also,\" Shelly begged. \"Some people like your Dad and Mrs. Sennet just don't believe enough to see for themselves, no matter how much they want to. Their minds are clouded too much by logic.\" That doesn't make sense to me. Why can't people just believe? I ask Shelly this. She shakes her head sadly. \"When people grow adults, too much stuff happens and they just can't.\" If getting older means losing Thomas J, I don't want to grow up.[Chapter 13] Well w've got there at last. I've loved the movie My Girl , since I was a little girl and have not grown out of it as an adult - why should I? In saying that, I loved writing this little fic, especially because the film had left so much unresolved. I feel a sense of accomplishment from finishing this story, but I'm a little sad, too, that this is the final chapter . I really enjoyed it, so much. To those who have stuck with me, from the beginning, thank you . Please leave a review , as I love constructive feedback from readers. If you have or are a staff member of a Community, please add my fic to it , so others can enjoy it as much as you did. I have other stories on here, too. Please go to my profile to find fics based on Harry Potter, Babysitter's Club, Gilmore Girls and a HP/Gilmore Crossover. After Shelly leaves Thomas J reminds me that he is there. I am angry. I'm angry that he does not show himself to others. I am angry that he let me upset his mother by telling her I miss him. I am angry that he lets me get in trouble with my Dad and doesn't reveal himself to save my pain. Most of all, I'm angry that he disappears all the time, making me wonder if I'm crazy. Shelly says I'm not and I think she believes it. I know now she believes me. I have to admit it. I'm glad that if he has to marry someone that he chose Shelly. I know she's not my Mom, but she'll always be there for me as a friend and that is enough for me. \"Thomas, how long are you here for?\" I ask him. I'm still angry at him, but I let a little of it subside. \"As long as you need me,\" he simply answers. \"What if I said I didn't need you anymore?\" It wasn't that I don't need him anymore. I just don't want people to think I'm weird when I talk to him. If Dad thinks I'm strange, I can imagine what people at school will think of me, walking through the halls talking to someone only I can see. They already think I'm weird. Judy thinks I'm weird, I know she does. She, like the rest of them doesn't understand my life, living in a funeral home and having a Dad like mine. It doesn't help that I'm the girl who used to conduct guided tours of my house for a dollar. There wasn't a single kid in the neighbourhood who didn't run screaming from the house when they saw Gramoo. Thomas J's presence would only make things worse. Thomas J looked at me sadly, although his eyes challenged me. \"Vada, I wouldn't believe you.\" I stared at my feet. There is no fooling Thomas J. Just like always he sees right through me. \"But I promise I'll make myself scarce when you start Junior High. I never want to bring you pain, Vada.\" What can I say? \"you never did\"? That would be a lie, well sort of, but it has been comforting to have him by my side, like he never left. I guess it's kind of selfish to keep him here, when he could be in Heaven, happily riding white horses, eating marshmallows and never getting picked last. I never appreciated him when he was alive and I haven't been very appreciative him, since he's been back. I need him, I know, but Heaven needs him more. I said all this to Thomas J. It felt good to finally get to say the things I should've, before. I finally find the courage to look at him. He is fading. \"Vada, I think its time for me to go, now.\" All I can do is nod. \"Thomas J, will you be there, when it's my time?\" Surprisingly, I am not crying anymore. \"Of course,\" he answers, with a smile. \"No matter what.\" Then just like when we were under the tree, I close my eyes and he kisses me. When I open my eyes, he is gone, this time for good. I am not sad anymore, really, I'm not. For the first time, I'm ready to move forward and embrace life and when it is my time, death. ****The End**** ","Summary":" It's been three months sincenThomas J was stung by all the bees. I remember how sad my Dad wasnwhen"},{"Movie":"Others","Title":"ESTA ENREDADA CANCIÓN DE AMOR","Author":"Milet7393","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9370217","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Capítulo 1 Estoy volando de regreso a mi país, quien diría 6 meses en los Estados Unidos me hace sentir como si hubiera pasado más tiempo. Denver – Colorado, espero poder regresar de visita algún día. El viaje ya va 2 horas y estoy leyendo mi libro favorito para matar el tiempo. EN LLAMAS (THG), lo amó, me encanta leer pero estos en especial, amo la película, amo a sus actores, Jenn y Josh, la verdad nunca he sido fanática de Hollywood... ¿Quién lo diría? Soy Alex, bueno en realidad mi nombre es Alexandra pero todos me llaman Alex o Alexa. Tengo 19 años, en un mes cumpliré 20, estudio medicina, voy a tercer año de mi carrera. Viaje a los Estados Unidos para estudiar inglés, la verdad odio eso de aprender nuevos idiomas, pero para mi carrera era necesario. No quiero presumir ni nada, pero siempre me ha gustado sobresalir, y sabía que aprender inglés me hacía destacar, además de que me habría muchas puertas en el campo profesional para mi futuro. Fue difícil que mis padres aceptaran el viaje, pero no podía desperdiciar la oportunidad... No todos los días puede viajar a otro país con todo pagado a estudiar. Aunque tuve que dejar la universidad por estos 6 meses regreso a seguir estudiando. Mi sueño siempre ha estado ahí, ser una gran doctora, poder ayudar a la gente, en verdad ayudar. Mi sueño es poder reunir bastante dinero para poder tener una vida cómoda para ofrecerle a mi familia y poder construir una fundación para ayudar a los más necesitados… es bueno soñar, ¿a qué si? La verdad es que no tuve ninguna necesidad económica mientras crecí, mis padres me dieron todo lo que necesitaba, ellos son muy trabajadores y aunque no tenemos millones de dólares vivimos bien, con gustos debes en cuando, como viajes, ropa y esas cosas. He tratado de hacer que se sientan orgullosos de mí, no fallándoles y recompensándoles en lo que puedo, por lo menos no decepcionándoles, haciendo mi mayor esfuerzo en los estudios. Quizás es por eso que al final aceptaron mi viaje. Todas mis amigas de la secundaria perdieron una materia en segundo año, ellas están repitiéndolas, pero yo no, así que mis padres me dejaron ir con la finalidad de que regrese y me iguale con ellas. Solo tengo un hermano, Andrés, aunque ya tiene 30 años es soltero, y no entiendo porque, él es una gran persona, trabajador, inteligente, simpático, pero bueno así es la vida. La verdad los he extrañado mucho, mi vida, mi familia, mis amigos y a él…. Aunque ha pasado 6 meses siento como mi corazón late con más fuerza con cada kilómetro que se acerca. Yo sé que soy estúpida, después de todo lo que me ha hecho, MASOQUISTA, eso es lo que soy… alguien que no se cansa de que le hagan daño, de que además de ver un viaje como una oportunidad lo vio también como una forma de escapar, de dejar de sufrir, pero no lo consiguió… ya veremos lo que pasa al regresar. - Disculpé, ¿desea que ya le sirvamos la comida? – me pregunta la azafata sacándome de mis pensamientos - Claro, ya tengo hambre Mi vida en este último año ha cambiado. En mi país no puedo decir que era triste, al contrario, disfrutaba de muchos amigos, a los que espero encontrar cuando regrese. Mi familia, me estará extrañando, mis papis, mi hermano, mis primos y primas, sobretodo mi prima Patricia y sus nenas (a quienes extraño muchísimo, las quiero tanto como si fueran mis hijas), mi madrina (mi segunda madre), mi padrino (mi segundo padre) y sus niños que son como mis hermanos. Debo agradecerle a mi padrino por conseguirme la oportunidad de viajar a los Estados Unidos. Él gracias a su trabajo habló con sus socios norteamericanos, les indicó mi entusiasmo por estudiar inglés y su socia Kristin, quien recién había enviudado me ofreció esta oportunidad de ir a vivir con ella, y pagarme el estudio. En verdad se lo agradezco. Y admito que lloré cuando me despedí de ella y su hijo. En verdad se portó como una verdadera madre, me demostró mucho cariño, y su hijo Peter que tiene 24 años se convirtió en un hermano para mí. Ella decía que le recordaba a su hija que falleció 3 meses antes junto con su esposo en un accidente automovilístico. Ella fue parte de mi gran cambio, ella me ayudo a elevar mi autoestima. Estos últimos 2 meses conseguí un gran trabajo, digamos que como modelo, bueno la verdad era un comercial donde tenía que bailar con una celebridad, mi rostro no se ve en el comercial, eso era lo que me hizo aceptar. A los 4 meses de estudio, ya dominaba el idioma, pero decidí quedarme a descansar y repasar otros 2 meses. Una tarde luego de mis clases en el instituto de inglés, mis compañeros y yo fuimos a un bar donde ponen música latina. Siempre me gustó bailar, y lo hago muy bien, un poco como profesional ya que cuando estaba en secundaria entre a un grupo de baile, y aprendí en verdad. Son de esas cosas que nunca se te olvidan. Cada vez que escucho música pareciera que mis pies se mueven solos. Ese día me subí en el escenario y me puse a bailar como loca, sintiendo el ritmo, luciéndome. Un agente se acercó y me propuso el negocio. Dijo que necesita una modelo para una campaña de fragancia masculina con una celebridad. Yo le dije que entre mis planes no estaba eso, que no me interesa ser conocida ni nada, pero él me dijo que en el comercial no saldría mi rostro y no porque fuera fea (la verdad a pesar de todo soy bien fotogénica, puedo estar horrible pero las fotos salen bien). Yo le dije que puede buscar una modelo o bailarina profesional. El agente recalco que el famoso y la dueña del producto que va el comercial, pidió exclusivamente a alguien que no sea famoso, alguien fresco, alguien que se pueda moldear, debido también porque debo entrenar la coreografía con el famoso que no es un buen bailarín. Me aclaró que no se podían negar debido a que el famoso (solo me dijo que era actor) no sabe bailar y no quiere sentirse mal con alguien profesional, por eso yo soy perfecta para el trabajo (no sé si sentirme feliz o intimidada). Ellos no se podían negar a las condiciones del famoso porque iba a donar todo lo que le iban a pagar a una fundación..! boom, eso habla bien de él, una persona caritativa. Luego de hablar con Kristin y su abogado firme el contrato, tenía que entrenar todos los días por el próximo mes y filmar el comercial, la única condición era que si yo decidía lanzarme a la fama, ellos serían la primera opción para representarme. Y acepte después de todo eso no estaba en mis planes. No le hable a nadie de mí familia sobre eso, quizás piensen que quiero quedarme en este país para trabajar. Mi padre y madre hubieran exagerado la situación, por eso no les dije. Y el dinero me sirve para mis gastos y poder pagar mi viaje de regreso sin tener que recurrir a Kristin. En verdad le agradezco mucho, ella se enoja siempre que yo no le quería aceptar algo, decía que el dinero es para gastar (ella tenía mucho). Mi primer día de \"trabajo\" llegue muy temprano, estaba ansiosa por conocer al famoso. Cuando llegue me presentaron al coreógrafo, Rich, y me senté a conversar sobre los detalles de mi baile. Esperamos más de media hora por el dichoso famoso y nada. Que falta de respeto, pues que se cree, que nosotros tenemos todo el día para esperarlo. Odio que me hagan perder mi tiempo, odio que me hagan esperar. Para calmar mi ansiedad le dije a Rich que regreso un momento, decidí ir a comprar una bebida en la tienda que se encontraba junto al edificio. Baje por las escaleras mientras iba leyendo una revista que encontré en el mostrador. Cuando estaba llegando a la segunda planta, choque con alguien que subía las escaleras, el choque hizo que la revista fuera a parar en algún lado y que mi cabeza estrellara con la pared. Auch… - Fíjate por donde vas – me dijo ese chico, no le vi el rostro, solo vi su chaqueta azul y gorra roja porque continuo subiendo las escaleras, llevaba prisa. ¿Qué le pasa?, él tuvo la culpa, yo bajaba por el lado derecho, él podía pasar tranquilamente junto a mí, y encima me echa la culpa. -Perdona a mi hermano, lleva un poco de prisa- un chico quizás de 15 o 16 años no estoy segura se acercó a mí con la revista, yo me encontraba sentada en uno de los escalones para recuperarme del golpe - Toma tu revista, ¿estás bien?- me dijo con cara de preocupado, la verdad su cara se me hacía muy conocida, no sé por qué pero ya lo había visto, no quise recordarlo, mi cabeza me daba vueltas, en serio fue un golpe duro - Si tranquilo, estoy bien, solo un poco mareada - En serio, perdona a mi hermano, él nunca se comporta así de descortés - Si se NOTÓ, encima me echo la culpa, pero tú no tienes por qué disculparte, en todo caso él fue el culpable- dije enojada -¿Necesitas algo?- me pregunto con tono preocupado- ¿a dónde ibas? - Me dirigía a la tienda que está en junto a comprar una bebida, ahora tengo que ir por aspirinas también – le dije aun enojada - Yo voy por ellas, si, permítemelo, solo voy a dejar las llaves de la moto a mi hermano porque se las olvido y regreso para darte comprando. - No te preocupes, yo puedo ir - Nada de eso, estás mareada, por favor no rechaces mi ayuda- dijo ofreciéndome su mano – vamos a que te sientes en el sillón Me dirigió al sillón del vestíbulo de esa planta, me senté ahí aun mareada – ya regreso Subió las escaleras, luego de un momento, bajo por ahí mismo – voy por tu bebida y tus aspirinas – sonrío y continuo bajando las escaleras Dentro de un momento regresó y me entregó la bebida con las aspirinas, las tome de un bocado. En menos de 5 minutos me sentía perfectamente. -Bien, te agradezco por todo – le dije amistosamente -No tienes por qué agradecer, después de todo mi hermano te dejó así- dijo con una sonrisa, quería decirle que su hermano me debía una disculpa, pero preferí guardarme el comentario -Bueno es tarde me tengo que ir, espero que en verdad estés bien, un gusto conocerte… -Alex – le respondí -Mucho gusto Alex, espero que en verdad te encuentres bien – se despidió mientras se acercaba a los escalones, cuando empezó a bajar se detuvo y giro hacia mí – Por cierto me llamo Connor – se despidió y bajo rápidamente los escalones y desapareció. Connor, porque se me hace tan conocido. Miro mi reloj y me doy cuenta que Rich debe estar esperándome, subo corriendo los escalones, llego jadeando al quinto piso, donde aprendería mi coreografía, cuando entró por la puerta me encuentro a Rich un poco preocupado -Alex porque tardaste?... tu pareja ya llegó..- dijo soltando un suspiro, yo giré buscándolo con la mirada y al ver esto Rich me respondió – fue al baño, en un momento regresa y lo conocerás - Perdón…. Es que cuando me dirigía por las escaleras un ESTÚPIDO chocó conmigo y me quede un poco mareada- le respondo con un tono de voz muy irónico -Hola- la voz llego de atrás, me gire y ahí estaba él, el muchacho con el que choque, el chico a quien me referí como estúpido, y seguramente lo escuchó -Alex, él es….-dijo Rich mi mente lo reconoció en ese instante, es alguien que yo admiraba sin duda -Josh Hutcherson – lo interrumpió él mientras me ofrecía su mano en forma de saludo.[Chapter 2] Capítulo 2 -Josh Hutcherson- extendí mi mano, él le dio un apretón y la besó- mucho gusto…. Alex ¿verdad? -Sí – le conteste muy seria. Debo admitir que es hermoso en persona, tiene una apariencia muy sexy, unos ojos encantadores, pero una sonrisa arrogante. Qué casualidad que sea el con quien tenga que bailar, digamos que lo \"admiro\" por su trabajo, pero eso no quita la mala impresión que me dio cuando chocamos, su falta de cortesía, además aún no se ha disculpado. - Es un gusto conocerte – me dijo sonriendo - Lo mismo digo – le respondí cínicamente - Muy bien que ya se conozcan – dijo Rich – Alex, te sientes bien, crees que podamos empezar? - Claro, no hay problema, el pequeño \"incidente\" no afectará mi trabajo- dije recalcando las palabras -Qué pena que te haya sucedido eso, deberías tener MÁS cuidado – respondió Josh muy irónicamente, me dio ganas de gritarle en la cara que me debía una disculpa -Bien empecemos… Alex quiero ver cómo te mueves al ritmo de la salsa – dijo Rich poniendo una canción - Claro, ¿qué quieres que haga? - Solo baila, siente la música y baila como te parezca, quiero ver como sientes el baile, como tu cuerpo se mueve con la música La canción sonó y en verdad me emocione, me dio ganas de cantar, era una canción conocida para mí, simplemente me deje llevar y baile, gire, me sacudí, eran tan des estresante bailar, luego terminó la canción. (DLG - Juliana -www_youtube_com/watch?v=KB8jjy9IGuA) - Muy bien Alex, creo que no tendré problemas contigo para que agarres el ritmo - Pensé que no querían a alguien profesional – dijo Josh - No soy profesional – le respondí rápidamente con enojo – simplemente aprendí a bailar desde pequeña, además soy latina, se cómo moverme – le dije con superioridad, ¿qué me está pasando?, yo no soy así de presumida -Pues en verdad pareces profesional, te mueves muy bien, definitivamente deberías dedicarte a esto – dijo Rich sonriéndome - Vamos es tu turno Josh - Yo nunca he bailado este ritmo – dijo rápidamente - No te preocupes, aprenderás rápido, además Alex te puede ayudar a desenvolverte, lo único que necesito es cooperación de ustedes – dijo mirándonos a ambos Puso nuevamente la canción y Josh trató de seguir el ritmo, pero en verdad se veía ridículo, sé que estoy siendo mala e imparcial pero el chico no sabía bailar, por lo menos no sabía bailar salsa. Cuando paro la música, Josh nos quedó mirando muy intrigado? Avergonzado? No pude interpretar esa mirada -Eso fue horrible, lo sé, prometo aprender – dijo mientras sonreía -Tranquilo, para estoy yo aquí, para moldearlos, cuando terminen, ustedes parecerán profesionales. Bueno vamos a empezar con el paso básico, luego avanzaremos con pasos más complicados y cuando los dominen armaremos la coreografía, OK? Ambos asentimos, Josh giro hacia mí y guiño un ojo, que tiene en mente, está coqueteando? -Ahora quiero verlos juntos, péguense como si fueran a bailar, quiero ver como lucen juntos – me acerco a Josh y él me sujeta de mi cintura y me acerca a él, su mano se posa en la parte baja de mi espalda y su otra mano sujeta la mía con rudeza. Estoy a 5 cm de su boca, sus ojos me miran directamente, debo admitir me siento intimidada por esa mirada, esa sexy mirada… ¿sexy? Por dios Alexandra en que estás pensando?, el ésta tratando de hacerte caer a sus pies, como todos los hombres, reacciona -Tienes unos hermosos ojos –me dice rompiendo el silencio, giro mi cabeza avergonzada, y veo a Rich hablando por su celular, en que momento sonó, no lo recuerdo, es como si el tiempo se congelo para mí, pero a mi alrededor las cosas siguieron su ritmo -Heeeeee,….. gracias?- le digo dudando, no sé porque pero me siento insegura -Sabes no es correcto decirlo, pero luces bien, lucimos bien- mira directo al espejo que nos rodea, me sonrojo- claro, eso gracias a mi Su comentario me hizo enfurecer, ¿que se cree?, la octava maravilla del mundo, nunca creí eso de él, claro no lo conocía, pero me doy cuenta que es un estúpido engreído… dios tengo que decírselo en la cara -ESTÚPIDO, EGOCENTRICO, ENGREIDO – lo digo en español como un susurro, y apenas termino de pronunciar esas palabras me siento mejor, aunque él no las entienda me siento mejor -HERMOSA, ENGREÍDA, SABELOTODO, QUE CREE QUE SOLO ELLA SABE ESPAÑOL – me responde sarcásticamente (en español) Dios, porque me tiene que pasar esto a mí, leí varias biografías de él y en ninguna decía que el supiera otro idioma. ¿Hermosa?.. en verdad dijo eso… reacciona Alexa te estas desviando del tema, él está jugando contigo -Eso es lo que piensas de mí? – le pregunto sonrojada -La verdad si y no -Hmmmmm? -Olvida lo de engreída pero pienso que eres hermosa- mis piernas se hicieron gelatina, porque me pasaba esto con él, será porque es famoso, no lo creo, esas cosas como fama y dinero nunca me han impresionado, entonces qué es? -Bien déjenme verlos- Rich se dirige a nosotros, nos examinó de pies a cabeza -Bien, la verdad es que se ven muy bien juntos, son como…mmmm digamos que el uno tiene lo que al otro le falta, así que se complementan – siento Josh presiona en mi espalda con su mano acercándome, a lo que yo me resisto – bien ya pueden separarse – me aparto rápidamente de él, es un alivio por un lado, pero debo admitir que disfrute su cercanía Rich nos enseñó el paso básico, obviamente yo ya lo había aprendido, el reto era que Josh lo dominara y más que todo que baile con naturalidad, aun se veía muy tieso. Luego de 2 horas de entrenamiento terminamos por hoy. -Es todo por hoy, Alex lo hiciste muy bien, tal vez esto te parezca un poco aburrido porque tú ya dominas la técnica, pero en verdad quiero que le pongas las mismas ganas de hoy -dijo sonriéndome – Josh, lo estás haciendo bien, aunque debes practicar más para que tus movimientos sean más naturales - Claro, tranquilo, me esforzaré más – dijo Josh muy animadamente - Bueno, yo me voy Rich, mañana nos vemos, que tengas una linda noche – dije mientras salía por la puerta- Adiós – dije mirando a Josh, aún estaba furiosa con él, tan difícil era pedir disculpas por su falla en las escaleras, y encima estaba coqueteando, pues que se cree, que porque tiene dinero o fama no tiene que pedir perdón Salí por la puerta y baje por las escaleras, mi músculos estaban aún calientes así que bajar los escalones eran un buen ejercicio, además el elevador tarda en subir. Busque mis audífonos en mi bolso, lo conecte al celular y a todo volumen reproduje la música a todo volumen. (12 Stones - Tomorrow Comes Today - www_youtube_com/watch?v=2dZsRUhkQx0) Continúe bajando los escalones, tengo que buscar un taxi y dirigirme a la casa de Kristin (mi casa). Cuando estaba por salir sentí que alguien me jalo del hombro haciéndome voltear. Josh estaba ahí me miró muy agitado, por lo que veo bajo corriendo los escalones porque se veía agitado. Retire uno de los audífonos -¿No me escuchaste, o preferiste ignorarme? – me pregunto muy arrogante - Por si te diste cuenta llevaba audífonos, no podía escucharte – le conteste muy seria mostrándole un audífono – además deberías ser más delicado, hiciste que mi hombro me doliera- exageré - Lo siento – dijo jadeando un poco - Me estas ofreciendo disculpas por maltratar mi hombro o por provocarme una contusión en mi cabeza - Por ambas cosas – respondió con una sonrisa coqueta – lamento que hayas tenido una mala impresión de mí, yo no soy así de descortés, por eso quise disculparme - ¿Por qué no lo hiciste en cuanto me reconociste? -No quería que Rich tuviera una mala impresión de mí, además cuando le comentaste lo que te paso recalcaste lo ESTÚPIDO que fui, no quería que Rich pensará que teníamos una situación incómoda - La verdad no me importa lo que piense Rich sobre ti, me di cuenta que eres un cretino, pero no hay problema por mi parte, si piensas que te incomodo pues haya tu -Estoy seguro que cretino no estaba entre las palabras que trataste de ocultar en otro idioma….mmm… estúpido, egocéntrico, engreído, esas eran las palabras verdad?, y aclaro q no me incomodas – dijo acercándose a mí, con una voz seductora – y yo te incomodo? Dios! Que arrogante, no puedo imaginar que todos los famosos sean así – ¿Porque? ¿Debería incomodarme tu presencia? – le respondí dándole la espalda – Acepto tus disculpas, feliz?... Te doy un consejo: para la próxima discúlpate primero y un poco de humildad no te vendría mal – dije y Salí rápidamente del edificio colocándome otra vez los audífonos, empecé a dirigirme hacia la esquina para tomar un taxi, cuando nuevamente me volteo -¿Qué? – le pregunte irritada - Eres rencorosa y orgullosa – me dijo sonriendo y con un tono arrogante - Gracias- le dije sarcásticamente - Esperaba que me perdonaras - Lo hice, acepte tus disculpas - No sonó muy sincera tu aceptación – no sé porque eso me produjo enojo, que era lo que quería, que le dijera que no tiene por qué disculparse, que yo fui la del error - Eres arrogante, te lo han dicho? - Y tú eres rencorosa - Nuevamente, GRACIAS – preferí ignorarlo no quería problemas en mi trabajo – Nos vemos mañana, aceptos tus disculpas, lo digo sinceramente – voltee dirigiendo mi camino Agarro nuevamente mi hombro, me giro hacia él y suelto un suspiro de frustración – Alex lo siento, sé que mi actitud no fue correcta, te llevaste un muy mala impresión de mi persona, sé que la primera impresión siempre es la importante, pero quiero que me des otra oportunidad, apenas nos conocemos, y estaremos trabajando juntos, lo menos que podemos hacer es llevarnos bien, no crees? - Tranquilo, no te juzgo, acepto tus disculpas, y no te preocupes por el trabajo, trataré de que no sea incómodo, ahora tengo que irme… Nos vemos mañana – dije tratando de ser cortes, no sé porque, él se había disculpado pero seguía irritándome - Permíteme invitarte una hamburguesa, en modo de ofrenda de paz – dijo levantando ambas manos - No puedo, tengo que llegar a casa - Entonces permíteme llevarte a tu casa - No - Por qué no? – caminaba a mi lado - Porque no me subo a autos con extraños - Bueno en realidad te llevaría en mi moto – dijo sonriendo – y no soy un extraño, tú me conoces, trabajamos juntos - Para mí eres un extraño, disculpa pero se me hace tarde, adiós Josh – dije ofreciéndole mi mano Él me sujeto de la mano - Solo promete que me aceptarás una hamburguesa alguna vez - No tienes por qué molestarte, en verdad, ya te perdone - No te invito porque quiero tu perdón, te invito porque quiero que seas mi amiga - Tú amiga? Porqué, tu estas rodeado de muchas personas famosas, con dinero y agradables, no necesitas mi amistad - Es verdad que estoy rodeado de personas así, pero debo admitir que muchas son hipócritas.. Alex en verdad me agradas - ¿En serio? - ¿En serio? Desde que nos conocimos hoy solo le he mostrado mala cara, claro fue su culpa, como podía agradarle - Si, fuiste sincera conmigo, no actuaste hipócritamente, no fingiste que no pasó nada, hiciste que aceptara mi culpa, me llamaste arrogante y me sugeriste humildad – suspiro – eres sincera, además me tienes intrigado, no cediste a mi encanto – dice guiñándome un ojo con un tono arrogante, no sé porque esto me causo risa- así que aceptas? - Aun eres un desconocido, pero…..- él sonrío - Pero..? - Quizás más adelante pueda aceptar una invitación – aunque lo dudo, pero quiero que me deje en paz - Eso sería fantástico, me alegra que aceptes y que pienses que soy lindo - Yo no he dicho que eres lindo - Pero lo pensaste – dijo el muy sonriente - En verdad eres arrogante Josh - Arrogante y lindo – dijo guiñándome el ojo, lo cual me produjo mucha gracia - Nos vemos mañana- dije sonriendo y continúe mi camino -Alex – escuche su grito llamarme cuando había recorrido unos 50 metros y giré - ¿Qué? – le dije con tono molesto, pero en verdad aún estaba sonriendo -Adiós – dijo con una gran sonrisa y el también giro de regreso al edificio Continúe mi camino, no sé porque pero a pesar de un mal inicio había logrado que cambiara mi opinión, debía admitirlo, a pesar de su arrogancia, él era encantador y había logrado formar una sonrisa en mi rostro que aún no se borra. Tomé un taxi y veinte minutos después estuve en casa. Cuando llegue Kristin ya había llegado a casa y preparada la cena, le pregunte por Peter y dijo que dormiría en casa de sus primos. Me pregunto sobre el famoso, le conté que era Josh Hutcherson lo cual la sorprendió y recordó q el mundo era pequeño, que tenía una suerte de conocer uno de mis \"ídolos\". Luego de la cena me dirigí a mi habitación, entre en Facebook a ver alguna novedad de mi familia, pero no dure mucho porque el cansancio me provoco sueño. Me di un baño, cuando me acerque al espejo para cepillar mis dientes me di cuenta que aún tenía una gran sonrisa en mi rostro. Fui a la cama, apague la luz y la tv dispuesta a dormir, pero aun pensaba en Josh - Quítate esos pensamientos- me dije a mi misma y caí profundamente dormida.[Chapter 3] Capítulo 3 Que frustrado me siento, como pudo rechazarme esa niña, que tiene que diablos tiene para que me tenga así, apenas la conozco y no puedo dejar de pensar en ella. Es tarde debería estar durmiendo, pero esos ojos cafés se cuelgan en mis sueños. En verdad no lo entiendo, debo admitir, ella es bonita, tiene un lindo cuerpo, pero no tiene nada que otras mujeres con las que he estado no tengan; bueno sí, su arrogancia me encanta, el hecho de llevarme la contraria. ¿Cómo no pudo ceder ante mi coqueteo? Es verdad yo le debía esas disculpas, no es que me moleste dárselas, pero algo en mí no me lo permitió. Normalmente cuando cometo un error las personas se aceptan mi error, eso no me hace sentir feliz, pero es el precio de la fama. Dios! Qué diablos tiene esta chica que me pone a analizar aspectos de mi vida que según yo, hasta ahora son perfectos. Que frustración, me siento desanimado, ella me rechazo, a mí, no es q sea un egocéntrico como ella supone, pero en verdad he tenido la oportunidad de que nada se me niegue, sobretodo en el campo de mujeres, he salido con mujeres realmente hermosas, famosas, con dinero, que no se han negado a caer bajo mi encantos. No quiero parecer un Don Juan, pero es la verdad, yo sé que es la fama y todo eso, pero aquí estoy dando vueltas en mi cama, sin poder descansar porque la dueña de unos hermosos ojos negros, una chica simple, normal, sencilla se colgó en mis pensamientos. Miro al reloj, 2:34 am, por lo que veo va a ser una noche larga. Repasemos lo sucedido este día. Por la mañana amanecí muy bien acompañado, antenoche fue genial, debo admitir que hace tiempo no me divertía de ese modo. Llegue a mi casa donde mi mamá se puso molesta debido a mi falta de \"cortesía\" por no llamar a avisar que no llegaría a dormir, tuve que excusarme con el hecho de que había tomado mucho y para no conducir quede a dormir en la casa de un amigo, obviamente no le podía decir que amanecí con una chica, que conocí en esa discoteca. Luego me di un baño, me puse ropa muy cómoda para asistir a la práctica de este baile. Connor decidió acompañarme a recoger mi moto de la casa de mi \"amigo\", fuimos en la camioneta de mi padre, subimos la moto en la parte de atrás y me acerco al edificio donde eran mis prácticas. Bajamos la moto y me di cuenta que llevaba más de 20 minutos de retraso, me despedí de Connor y subí las escaleras corriendo, cuando choque con ella. La verdad estaba preocupado por el tiempo, odio la impuntualidad, por lo mismo yo no me la permito. Cuando llegue Rich me dijo que mi compañera salió a comprar algo, que se llama Alexandra y que ella es de un país de Latinoamérica. Nos sentamos a esperarla cuando llego Connor y me entrego las llaves de mi moto, que estúpido y descuidado que soy, luego me dijo que la chica con la que choque se dio un buen golpe, me sentí mal en verdad, no fue su culpa, fui yo el descuidado. Le pedí que me disculpara con ella y se fue rápidamente. Salí al baño y cuando regrese ella está allí, en verdad era muy linda, su mirada era dulce, a pesar del enfado que mostraba su mirada, escuche lo que le dijo a Rich sobre el estúpido que la empujo. Cuando me ofreció su mano presentándose no pude contenerme, fue como si quisiera saltar sobre ella y besar esos hermosos y delicados labios rojos, asi que bese su mano. Ella en verdad estaba enfadada, me los demostró todo el tiempo mientras estuvimos ahí. Cuando bailo en verdad me enloqueció, sentí esa atracción hacia ella que hacia que mi viejo amigo quisiera salir de mi pantalón. Esa forma tan natural de moverse, esa cadera que se balanceaba tan sutilmente. Dios, una simple chica estaba haciendo que babee a chorros. No cedió a mis encantos, eso lastima el ego a cualquier hombre, definitivamente ella tendrá que ceder ante mí, pero primero es lo primero, debo ser su \"amigo\". Se despidió con un simple ADIOS y salió rápidamente, tome mi chaqueta y me despedí de Rich, me fui hacia el ascensor y me di cuenta que este estaba subiendo lo que quiere decir que ella bajo por las escaleras. Apresure mi paso, cuando estaba por llegar a la planta más baja prácticamente corriendo, la vi, la llame por su nombre pero simplemente me ignoro. Que mujer para frustrante, así que la tome del hombro y la giré. Ella fue hostil, construyo una barrera entre nosotros la cual me dedicaría a derrumbar, en verdad la palabra frustración se quedaba corta para el sentimiento que me acechaba cuando ella no cedía ante mis argumentos y propuestas. No me acepto ir por una hamburguesa, no acepto que la llevara a su casa, mierdaaa desde cuando yo le ruego a alguien. Dijo que quizás algún día, pero siento que solo lo dijo para que la dejara en paz. Lo único bueno de toda esa pelea es que ella me perdono, en verdad creo que fue sincera, y pude arrancarle una sonrisa que me lleno de satisfacción, una hermosa sonrisa que era únicamente mía. Mañana volveré a verla y tengo que llegar hacia ella, tengo que lograr que se interese por mí, tengo que probar esos labios.- Josh reacciona!- me digo a mi mismo- Te estas encaprichando, tú no eres así, no debes dejar que una niña te baje el ego o se meta dentro de ti. Agarro mis cobijas y me envuelvo, cierro los ojos con la esperanza de poder dormir. Me despierto con mal humor, bendita alarma, estiro un brazo para apagarla. 8h30am, es hora de empezar el día. -Hola Mamá- digo entrando a la cocina y besándola en la mejilla -Hijo ¿Qué son esas ojeras?, que diablos estabas haciendo que no dormiste – mi mamá me conoce bien, sabe que cuando no duermo bien se refleja en mi rostro -Tranquila mamá, no sé por qué pero no pude dormir, pero no me siento cansado, tranquila -Dime que estabas pensando para q no durmieras -Nada en especial mamá – digo tratando de evitar el tema, ella es muy perceptiva y persuasiva -No me mientas Joshua Ryan Hutcherson, soy tu madre y te conozco ya 20 años -Bueno estaba pensando en alguien que conocía ayer -Asi que hay una chica -NO… ¿Qué?... mmmm… como lo sabes -Josh, es fácil saber cuándo se trata de chicas, a ver dime que paso, eso es nuevo en ti, que pienses en una chica, mejor dicho que una chica invada tus pensamientos a tal punto que te robe el sueño, con lo perezoso que eres -No lo sé mamá, se llevó una mala impresión de mí…- le conté lo del accidente, y mi charla con ella luego de la práctica, claro obviando mi coqueteo y mi atracción hacia ella -Hay niño, en verdad entiendo a esa niña, yo también hubiera estado enfadada, en verdad te hubiera considerado un cretino por no disculparte… y estoy de acuerdo en no aceptar invitaciones de un desconocido, aunque sea un chico lindo como tú – dice guiñándome el ojo -Ni me lo recuerdes mamá, me siento tan mal por ser tan descortés -Ya no te tortures, lo hecho, hecho está, no ganas nada lamentándote, lo único que puedes hacer es recompensarla, en verdad redimirte con ella- dice poniendo un plata con huevos revueltos sobre la mesa_ eso si te interesa que ella te perdone… lo resolverás hijo -Gracias mamá… lo haré, la recompensaré -Ese es mi hijo, ahora apúrate con tu desayuno si no llegaras tarde al gimnasio y a la práctica y estoy seguro de que no quieres otro incidente como el de ayer Más tarde estoy subiendo en el ascensor, mi manos sudan, esto es raro, no me había pasado, estoy ¿nervioso? ¿ansioso? Todo por ella por volver a verla. Cuando camino hacia el salón donde practicamos le encuentro a ella sola, saltando, mejor dicho calentando para el baile -Hola – le digo cuando atravieso el umbral de la puerta -Hola – me dice con una sonrisa -¿Calentando? -Si, Rich dijo que volvería en 15 minutos, tenía que atender una llamada -Oh,….mmmm… y que tal tu noche? -Bien, dormir como un oso – sonrío con esa comparación – en verdad estaba cansada, casi no despierto el día de hoy para ir al instituto, mi cama literalmente me abrazo y no quería soltarme -Bueno pues tu cama es muy afortunada – digo con voz dulce, esperando ver su reacción hacia mi coqueteo -Pues creo que sí, mi cama me ama y el despertador quiere separarnos – sonríe, en verdad su comentario me hace envidiar a esa cama – y… ¿Qué tal tu noche? -Pues mi cama me odia, anoche prácticamente quería alejarme de ella, se puso incomoda -Muy gracioso, pero te creo, esas ojeras te delatan -Jajaja pues discúlpame por no haber tenido un sueño embellecedor como tú – suelta una carcajada y yo siento dicha por lograr que sonría de esa manera- puedo preguntarte algo? -Lo estás haciendo -Ok, que odiosa que eres –le digo dulcemente, espero que no se ofenda -Jajaj dale, que me quieres preguntar -Mmmmm, bueno ayer dejaste claro que eres latina –digo marcando la palabra- que te trae a este país? Ella me conto sobre su viaje para estudiar inglés, lleva aquí ya 4 meses, asiste a un instituto para perfeccionar el idioma, me dijo que estudia medicina en su país, que deberías estar en tercer año pero decidió interrumpir sus estudios para viajar, en verdad es muy agradable, y para nada aburrida, ni superficial, me doy cuenta que es una persona echada para delante, con sueños, metas que piensa cumplir, porque no hay nadie que la detenga -Bueno espero que mi país te haya tratado bien hasta ahora -Pues lo ha hecho, he disfrutado mucho esta experiencia -¿Puedo hacerte otra pregunta? – no sé porque pero me muero por saber si tiene novio, es ahora o nunca, me siento valiente, aunque es frustrante porque junto a ella soy un manojo de nervios -Claro..! -Tu…mmm.. Tú?.. -Buenas tardes chicos, perdonen la tardanza, espero que ya hayan calentado – entra Rich interrumpiendo mi ataque de valentía Empezamos la práctica, Rich nos enseñaba pasos \"básicos\" según él, en verdad me resultaba difícil seguirlos, me costaba hacerlos con naturalidad, Alex no tenía problemas con ello, ella simplemente era fabulosa bailando. Mientras tomamos un descanso, nos sentamos en el piso apoyados contra la pared, le seguí preguntando sobre su vida, su familia, su carrera, cosas muy comunes pero que me resultaron interesantes. Tal vez su vida parezca sencilla pero me encanta la emoción con la que la narra. -Por cierto, ¿qué era lo que me querías preguntar cuando Rich llego? – porque tuvo que recordarlo -No lo recuerdo, se me fue la idea - miento -Mmm que mal, espero que lo recuerdes -Te prometo que apenas lo recuerde te preguntaré -Claro – sonríe ampliamente -bueno creo que por hoy eso ha sido suficiente, me alegra ver que se sienten más cómodos uno con el otro – dice Rich entrando por la puerta- pueden irse a casa -Gracias Rich, en verdad hoy ha sido muy cansado, prometo practicar, no quiero sentirme menos que mi pareja – digo ofreciéndole mi mano a ella para que pueda ponerse de pie -Lo estás haciendo muy bien – dice él muy seguro – bueno les dejo porque tengo un compromiso, nos vemos mañana chicos, adiós Alex, estuviste muy bien hoy – dice saliendo del salón -Es verdad, lo hiciste muy bien Josh, tienes que darte crédito, la salsa no es un ritmo fácil, y menos si no estás familiarizado -Sus palabras me reconfortan señorita – se me viene una idea a la cabeza – ¿estas apurada por llegar a tu casa? -Mmm la verdad no, se suponía que la practica dura hasta las 7pm y apenas son 5h15pm, por qué? -Es que quiero ver como se baila…mmmm.. en pareja este ritmo…. Me podrías enseñar? -Claro por qué no – recuerdo que no tenemos música, ella cae en cuenta nuestro problema porque añade – Tengo música en mi celular -¿Te gusta ese ritmo para escucharlo? -La verdad no es mi música preferida para ser escuchada, pero cuando te alejas de ella la extrañas, así que la tengo porque cuando quiero bailar solo uso mi celular -Oh – ella pone una canción de salsa, no la había escuchado pero es salsa muy lenta, quizás romántica (Guayacán - Ay Amor - www_youtube_com/watch?v=9W707o8Jz_Q) -Vamos- dice ofreciéndome su mano, la cual tomo si dudar -Así- dice colocando mi mano izquierda en su cintura y agarrando la otra, lleva su mano a mi hombro y sujeta fuertemente mi mano derecha- ahora cierra los ojos -¿Qué? Nooo, te voy a pisar -Tranquilo, relájate, haz lo que te digo, así sentirás la música.. Confía en mí –esas palabras me convencieron, cierro mis ojos y me doy cuenta de que soy más consciente de su cuerpo pegado al mío, de su cercanía, de su suave respiración, escucho la música, en verdad es relajante, es suave, sutil como ella -Ahora escucha la música, siente el ritmo, deja llevarte por él, si es rápido puedes aligerar tu paso, tienes que sentir que tu baile y la música se fusionen….- lo dice tan lentamente que me estremece, es como una corriente que ingresa por mis oídos y me recorre todo el cuerpo- Ahora vamos con el paso básico, hazlo a la velocidad que sientas que la música te pide Lo hago, pierna hacia atrás, 1,2,3, nuevamente, 1,2,3 – Eso es, lo estás haciendo muy bien – me dice animadamente- ahora vamos con el segundo paso Lo hace parecer tan fácil, no sé que estoy haciendo, lo único de lo que estoy consciente es que su cuerpo guía al mío- Ahora abre los ojos – lo hago muy lentamente y me pierdo en ese mar oscuro de sus ojos que me miran directamente -Si vez, lo haces muy bien- simplemente asiento con mi cabeza -Probemos algo más difícil, solo necesito que relajes tus músculos y veras como resulta – vuelvo a asentir con mi cabeza, de pronto me he quedado sin palabras Ella agarra mis dos manos, me empuja hacia atrás y tira de mi brazo, lo retuerce, no me duele pero se desliza muy suavemente, por detrás de mí, gira sin romper la unión de nuestras manos y termina justo en mi frente en la misma posición inicial….. waooo, no pensé que podía hacer eso -Y.. ¿Qué te pareció? -Waoo eso fue fantástico, no pensé que fuera tan sencillo – le digo sonriendo -Creo que aprenderás, estoy segura de que Rich pondrá muchos de estos giros en la coreografía Le sonrío ampliamente satisfecho, después de todo esto de bailar se está poniendo interesante –¿podemos intentar los otros pasos en pareja? -Claro aún tenemos tiempo – sonríe, ella disfruta esto en verdad, sus ojos muestran pasión, me pregunto si ella tendrá ese mismo sentimiento por todo lo que hace, y aquí estamos otra vez nuestros cuerpos juntos, dejándose llevar por la melodía, lo hace parecer muy fácil -La salsa es un ritmo muy especial sabes?, no es como otros, debe ser elegante, sutil, preciso, la pareja debe entenderse bien para que luzca bien -mmmmm… - es ahora o nunca - ¿tienes novio? – listo, lo hice, espero que no se enoje, pero tenía que soltarlo de una vez -mmmm? Escuchaste algo de lo que te dije?- me mira con incredulidad mientras seguimos bailando -Perdóname, si te escuche pero te prometí que cuando recordará la pregunta, te la diría- digo levantando los hombros - Así que esa era la pregunta? – suspira – sí que eres directo – lo dice con cierto tono de sarcasmo- NO, no lo tengo Siento como suelto aire, no sabía que estaba conteniendo el aliento, siento el alivio expandirse por mi cuerpo, ¿porque me importa tanto su respuesta? Hace un día que la conozco y estoy actuando como un novio celoso - ¿En verdad? – frunce el ceño – yo sé que no es mi asunto, pero me sorprende que una chica tan linda como tú no tenga pareja -Gracias por el cumplido pero no lo tengo, en mi país no lo tenía, y desde que vine para aca tampoco he salido con nadie…mmmm.. digamos que no estoy interesada en salir con nadie de aquí- esa es una indirecta, es por eso que rechaza mis ofertas de salida - Oh- no puedo decir nada más, su respuesta me dejo sin palabras, no la entiendo en verdad -Bueno creo que es hora de irme, será mejor que descanse para mañana – diablos, la incomodé -¿Me permitirás llevarte a tu casa esta vez? – le pregunto esperanzado, diablos en verdad no sé qué me pasa con esta niña -No, aun eres un desconocido -¿Y para cuando crees que eso cambie? -No lo sé – dice agarrando su bolsa, me apresuro a recoger mis cosas para salir iguales, bajamos en silencio por el ascensor, salimos del edificio, cuando ella rompe el silencio -Bueno, nos vemos mañana Josh espero que puedas descansar bien esta noche, las ojeras no te lucen – sonrío ante su comentario - Eso espero…mmmm… ¿puedes contestar otra pregunta?- frunce el ceño, lo que hace que se forme un V entre sus ojos, sobre su nariz- ¿lo que dijiste ayer sobre quizás algún momento aceptar mi invitación, no era cierto? ¿verdad? Por favor se sincera -Bueno – suelta un suspiro- me atrapaste, la verdad solo lo dije para que no insistieras en el tema -¿Puedo preguntar por qué? Sonríe – NO…..no puedes – que frustrante – adiós Josh, linda noche – sin dudarlo gira y se dirige hacia la esquina, la quedo mirando hasta que desaparece de mi campo visual, que mujer para confusa, no sé qué voy a hacer con ella, giro dirigiéndome a mi moto, me pongo el casco y conduzco hacia mi casa, estoy seguro que será otra larga noche, cortesía de Alexandra y sus pensamientos contradictorios.[Chapter 4] Capítulo 4 -Alex llegaste temprano -Peter! – digo abrazándolo -Waoo, 2 días y se nota que me extrañaste- dice correspondiendo a mi abrazo -Pues lo hice, no vuelvas a dejarme tanto tiempo, por lo menos avísame, ¿Cómo es eso de que te vas con tus primos y no le avisas a tu casi hermana? -Lo siento, en verdad fue de improviso, ahora dime como te va en tu trabajo, y por qué siento que tienes que contarle algo a este cuerpito caribeño? -Estás loco Peter, pero si tengo muchas cosas que contarte, ¿dónde está tu mamá? -Salió con Pool y Luise, tenemos toda la noche para nosotros, asi que mientras me ayudas a terminar la merienda me puede ir contando sobre ese chico -¿Qué chico? -El que te tiene así -No he dicho que haya algún chico -¿no lo hay?- me pregunta alzando su ceja en modo interrogante -Bueno si – digo sonriéndole- ¿Qué comes que adivinas? Jajaja te adoro menso pero vas a tener que cocinar solito porque yo pienso ir a tomar un baño y ponerme ropa más cómoda -Buena excusa, por no cocinar, ya admite que odias hacerlo – dice dándome un golpe en mi hombro- corre a bañarte porque tienes que contarme mi vida- nuestra relación es de hermanos, nos llevamos muy bien, nos tratamos de \"mi vida\", \"mi amor\", pero solo en broma, lo quiero mucho él se ha convertido en una persona muy especial -Ya regreso mi amor, espero un rica merienda – digo subiendo las escaleras dirigiéndome a mi cuarto Llegue a mi cuarto, entre a la ducha, el agua caliente relaja mis músculos, Salí y me coloque unos pantalones cortos y una blusa con tirantes holgada, cómoda para dormir, cuando recién llegue me sentía intimidada por Peter, ahora le tengo mucha confianza, hay veces que él se levanta y camina por toda la casa solo en sus boxers, la verdad nos tenemos tanta confianza que yo simplemente hago bromas sobre su cuerpo, que en realidad es muy estilizado debido al ejercicio que hace. -¿lasaña? ¿a qué debemos el honor? – digo llegando a la cocina observando mi plato ya servido -A nada en especial, ahora siéntate y empieza a cacarear -Yo no cacareo – le digo haciendo un puchero -Eres mujer, todas las mujeres lo hacen -Estúpido jajaj bueno ahí va Le conte todo sobre Josh, sobre nuestra \"presentación\", sus disculpas, sus invitaciones, contándole todo lo que paso sin omitir nada -Bien, pues es obvio que le gustas -Yooo, estás loco, él es famoso, adinerado, puede tener a la mujer que quiera -Alex! Ya te he dicho que tu tiene lo que cualquier hombre deseara, preciosa, eres inteligente, cariñosa, tienes un gran corazón, eres sinceras y echada hacia delante, si no te quisiera como mi hermana ya hubiera tratado de ligarte -Mejor no discuto contigo, pero dudo que le guste a Josh -Eso es lo de menos, el real problema está en si TI te gusta -¿A mí? No, bueno si, la verdad él es guapo, lo considero atractivo pero no me gusta gusta… ash ni yo sé lo que digo -Bueno en verdad espero que solo sea atracción.. Mi consejo es que sigas como hasta ahora, siendo tu misma con él y no dándole oportunidad -¿Oportunidad? -Sí, no lo conozco pero sé que ese tipo de personas que están rodeados de fama, son caprichosos y cuando quieren algo de alguien lo consiguen, no quiero que te hagan daño -Tranquilo, dudo que le guste a Josh para eso, además no creo eso de él, pero con todo no te preocupes, él no me interesa en lo más mínimo -Aun piensas en Darío ¿verdad? –lo miro con tristeza, porque lo menciona, 4 meses lejos de él y aún sigue dentro de mi corazón – tranquila Alex, es bueno hablar -He puesto distancia y tiempo de por medio, pero cierro mis ojos y el ésta colgado de mis sueños, de mi mente y mi corazón -No quiero torturarte pero en 2 meses estarás de nuevo junto a él, tiene que tratar de superarlo, date la oportunidad, sale con otra persona, conoce gente, yo sé que en algún lugar hay alguien para ti -¿En verdad lo crees? -Estoy segura pequeña – dice acariciando mi mejilla – lo que no estoy seguro es como podré vivir cuando te vayas -No me lo recuerdes, Peter te extrañaré demasiado, promete que viajaras a visitarme junto con Pool y Luise y tu mamá -Eso es obvio, viajaré en cuanto pueda, además debo conocer a tus amigos, sobretodo a Santiago que se quiere llevar mi puesto de mejor amigo -Tú eres mi hermano Peter, él también lo es, tengo un corazón para los dos -Y tengo que darle un buen golpe a su hermano Darío por ponerte triste -Mejor olvida eso, yo no sé si te lo permitiera -Ay pequeña, ¿Cómo puedes seguir enamorada de ese…..ese estúpido? -Ni yo lo sé, mejor cambiemos de tema y vamos a ver una película Nos acurrucamos en el sofá, nos cubrimos con una manta y pusimos la película. Ya avanzada la noche nos despedimos y directo a la cama. Bendito despertador, en serio, quiere separarme de la cama, 7am, hora de levantarme. Me levanto y directo a la ducha, es la mejor forma de estar despierta, decido arreglarme con unos jeans ajustados que siempre me han gustado como me hace lucir, y una blusa strapless un poco ajustada para mi gusto pero Peter dice que me luce esta ropa, no estoy segura de ello, pero decidí hacerle caso. Llevare ropa deportiva para la práctica en mi bolso, tendré que llegar más temprano para cambiarme. -Buenos días – llego a la cocina y encuentro a Kristin y Peter cocinando, me acerco a Kristin para darle un beso -Alex, únete a nosotros, ayer compre unos bocadillos para el desayuno -Eso suena delicioso- nos sentamos en la pequeña mesa de la cocina -¿Cómo te fue ayer Alex? -Bien, Kristin, lo estoy disfrutando mucho -¿y ya te llevas mejor con Josh? - ¿Cómo es eso?- interrumpe Peter- ¿Le contaste a mi mamá antes que a mí?- dice indignado -Tú no estabas -Además yo puedo dar tan buenos consejos sobre chicos como tú- espeta Kristin -Es verdad -Claro, uds se unieron para despojarme de la familia y de mis derechos-dije con tono indignado -Menso – le espete- te quiero tontito, para otra no te vayas 2 días – Peter hace un puchero muy gracioso -Alex, no sabes cuánto te vamos a extrañar – me dice Kristin abrazándome -Y yo a uds, en verdad, les agradezco por todo lo que han hecho por mí, ya saben, aceptándome en su casa, y sobretodo por hacerme sentir como en familia -Alex, eres parte de nuestra familia, eres como una hija que me va abandonar en 2 meses, a quien voy a tener que visitar muy seguido, además de que las vacaciones tendrás que venir aunque sea 2 semanas -Kristin, tu sabes que no tengo dinero para eso, peor en verdad espero que me visiten. Serán muy bien recibidos en mi casa cuando vayan -Alex, ya te he dicho que no te hagas lío por el dinero, pero tienes que prometerme que lo harás -Bueno, mejor no discuto con uds, pero ahora regreso a clases y tengo que ver cómo me reparto las vacaciones para venir, porque normalmente las vacaciones haces extensiones universitarias -Nada de excusas niña, no aceptaré un NO -Los quiero mucho, los extrañare mucho, pero no es momento de ponernos tristes, es hora de que suba corriendo a lavarme los dientes, si no llegare tarde al instituto, gracias por el desayuno – digo levantándome y poniendo la vajilla en el lavadero -Tranquila, yo lavo, corre o te harás tarde – dice Peter -Te debo una -Me debes muchas – le guiño el ojo y salgo corriendo – Por cierto te ves bien pequeña Llegue al instituto, encontré a Raúl, Juan, Pablo y Jessica, ellos también vienen de otros países a estudiar inglés, son buenos compañeros, siempre me hacen reír, ellos se quedaran por más tiempo que yo. Todos dominamos el idioma, pasamos casi todo el día en el instituto los anteriores meses, ahora y solo vengo por las mañanas ya que por las tardes tengo que ir con Rich y Josh. Almorzamos en una pizzería en frente del instituto, a las 2h30pm me despido para ir al ensayo, por suerte queda a una cuantas cuadras, puedo ir caminando pero tengo que llegar temprano para mudarme de ropa. -Nos vemos mañana niños -Que te vaya bien – me di Jessica, Juan y Raúl me hacen señas con sus manos -Alex ¿puedo hablar contigo? – me dice Pablo -Creo que otro rato por que no puedo tardar -Podría acompañarte hasta dónde vas, y aprovechamos el tiempo, ¿Qué dices? -Vale, vamos, adiós chicos – salimos del instituto, en silencio, hasta que él habla -¿y cómo te está yendo en ese trabajo? -Muy bien, estamos practicando los pasos básicos y luego armaremos la coreografía, terminaremos de filmar antes de que yo regrese a mi casa -Bien...mmmm… sabes que te extrañaré? -Yo también los extrañare a todos -Alex, porque evades el tema -No estoy evadiendo nada Pablo -Sí, si lo haces, llevo invitándote a salir desde que empezamos el instituto, y siempre me rechazas, ¿no te caigo bien? -No, no es eso, tu sabes quería conocerte mejor, y ahora que lo hago no he tenido mucho tiempo -Alex, yo sé que eso no es verdad, siempre hay tiempo, no espero que me digas tus razones -Pablo, esto te sonara raro, no eres tú, soy yo, no sé cómo decirlo -Tranquila, no lo digas, no tienes por qué contarme, me alivia saber que no es por algo que yo haya hecho, pero por favor, dame una oportunidad, solo promete que saldrás conmigo antes de que te vayas, y que me darás la oportunidad de conocernos mejor, si no sale bien, seguiremos siendo amigos, por favor -Vale niño, sabes que tienes razón, pero estos días estoy atareada, que te parece si lo dejamos para después de navidad, esos días tengo libres hasta año nuevo, podemos ver que hacemos ¿Qué opinas? -Bien, por lo menor no me dijiste que no – habíamos llegado a la entrada del edificio- bien aquí estamos, gracias por todo amiga, en verdad eres un gran persona -Gracias, tú también eres genial Pablo- él se acerca y me abraza, yo correspondo su gesto - Hola Alex, nos vemos arriba – aflojo mi abrazo y giró, solo pude ver a Josh entrando por el ascensor, veo mi reloj, son casi así las 3pm y tengo que cambiarme -¿Quién era ese? – dice Pablo por lo que noto no lo reconoció -Es mi pareja de baile, te dejo pequeño se me hace tarde -Claro nos vemos mañana – me da un beso en la mejilla, le digo un adiós con mi mano y subo corriendo por los escalones, llego al salón y solo encuentro a Josh -Hola – me dice sonriendo pero con tono serio -Hola, puedes hacerme un favor – levanta la ceja- voy al baño a cambiarme, si llega Rich dile que ahora vuelvo -Claro, yo le digo - Salgo hacia el baño para cambiarme[Chapter 5] Capítulo 5 Cuando me levante tenía un gran deseo de que el tiempo pasara rápido, quería verla, necesitaba preguntarle muchas cosas, tenía que insistir para que me dé información y para que acepte mis propuestas. Cuando me dirigí a la práctica, estuve pensando que decirle, que preguntarle, estaciones mi moto y cuando iba hacia la entrada la vi. Estaba muy hermosa, lucia unos jeans negros que hacían lucir a sus piernas muy torneadas y largas, esa blusa que hacia lucir sus hombros tan delgados y su cabellos que caían como cascada, por primera vez lo veo suelto, tiene el cabello muy rizado, sus bucles caen suavemente sobre su espalda, esta hermosa. Me doy cuenta de que está con un chico, él la abraza y ella le corresponde, tal vez tuvieron una cita, por eso esta tan bonita, se arregló para él, me mintió. Dijo que no salía con nadie, me mintió, no quería salir conmigo. Que tengo de malo, porque ella lo prefiere él. Me acerco a la entrada, quiero que me note, que se de cuenta que se de su mentira, porque estoy tan molesto -Hola Alex, nos vemos arriba – digo y prácticamente corro hacia el ascensor que para mí buena suerte se abrió apenas aplaste el botón para su llamada Cuando llegue al salón no había nadie, Rich aún no llega, me apoye contra la pared, y trato de meditar porque me siento tan frustrado, 3 días y esta niña maneja mi temperamento, lo ha hecho una montaña rusa. Veo que entra al salón y dirige una mirada hacia mí, luce muy linda con esa ropa, en verdad muy provocativa, quisiera encerrarla en esta habitación, solo para mí, quisiera besarla, sentir esos gruesos labios sobre los míos, por dios, que me pasa con ella, nunca me he sentido de esta manera -Hola – le digo tratando de que no se note mi frustración -Hola, puedes hacerme un favor – levanto la ceja- voy al baño a cambiarme, si llega Rich dile que ahora vuelvo -Claro, yo le digo – sale del salón, y yo la quedo viendo como camina, babeando por esta niña que me está volviendo loco, de verdad tengo que pensar lo que voy a hacer con ella Cuando regresa, Rich aún no llega, ella luce ahora su ropa deportiva y ha recogido su cabello en una coleta, que cambio, pero aun así luce muy bonita. Quiero reclamarle por haberme mentido pero si lo hago se dará cuenta que me tiene en sus manos. Ella se pone a hacer sus ejercicios de calentamiento y yo la imito -¿Qué tal tu mañana?- pregunto muy sutilmente tratando de ocultar mi pregunta escondida ¿Quién es él? ¿Por qué me mentiste? -Tranquila y la tuya? -Bien, igualmente tranquila –como puede decir eso, porque me miente, no se da cuenta que la atrape en su gran engaño -Así qué… saliste con tu novio? – espero su respuesta, ella duda al responder -No, fui al instituto y mi compañero me acompaño hasta aquí - ¿debería creerle? -Pues era muy cariñoso como para ser un simple compañero -Tienes razón, él es muy cariñoso conmigo, es un gran chico – está provocándome?, porque siento mi sangre hervir -Me invito a salir, le dije que lo haremos en la semana que tenemos libre entre navidad y año nuevo – soltó esta información tan lentamente, que me dio tiempo para asimilarlo, una punzada de celos y envidia me atacó, porque a él sí y a mí no -Pensé que no salías con nadie -No lo hago, pero decidí que debería aprovechar el tiempo - ¿Aprovechar el tiempo? Qué diablos significa eso, porque con él, yo podría hacer que \"aproveche el tiempo\", la complacería en todo, le haría disfrutar -Perdón la tardanza, Hola muchachos- como siempre Rich nos interrumpía Practicamos mucho, creo que voy mejorando, decidí no decirle nada más, cada vez que descansábamos conversamos sobre cosas que le gustan, en verdad ella es muy agradable, poder tratarla de esta manera me satisface, todas las tardes le ofrezco llevar a su casa pero ella siempre me rechaza, eso es lo frustrante con ella, parece que le agrado pero termina rechazándome. Todos los días su \"amigo\" le acompaña hasta la puerta, trato de no hacerle notar mi ira cuando los veo. Así concluimos nuestra primera semana, y la segunda, hoy será nuestro último día antes del descanso que tenemos por navidad, de aquí volveremos a vernos luego de año nuevo. En verdad la voy a extrañar, no sé cómo pedirle su número de teléfono para mantenerla en contacto, para desearle una feliz navidad, un feliz nuevo año, aunque lo que en verdad quisiera es pasar con ella esas fechas y que mis labios sobre los suyos hablen. Llego al edificio y los veo a ella y a su amigo, están riendo, quiero pasar ignorándolos, pero no puedo, así que me acerco a saludarlos -Ehhh Hola Alex – ellos se percatan de mi presencia -Hola Josh – me dice sonriendo mientras me acerco para besar su mejilla – él es Pablo -Mucho gusto – le digo ofreciéndole mi mano, lo examino de pies a cabeza, ¿Qué tiene él que yo no? -Espera ¿eres Josh Hutcherson verdad? -Si lo soy -Vaya es fantástico conocerte, muy buenas tus películas -Gracias – miro el reloj- Alex será mejor que subamos, o se nos hará tarde – miento, aún tenemos casi 15 mits para llegar -Tienes razón, nos vemos Pablo – le dice mientras lo abraza -¿Entonces nos vemos el miércoles? -Claro ahí estaré -Bueno yo te llamo para ver el lugar -Listo, estamos en contacto – le dice ella guiñándole el ojo, otra ola de furia se extiendo por mí, veo alejarse con una gran sonrisa, quisiera quitarle de ese rostro con un gran golpe -Vamos – dice Alex sacándome de mis pensamientos, la sigo hacia los ascensores, entramos en él y rompo el silencio -¿Así que saldrás con tu amigo? -Sí, el miércoles -¿Y a dónde irán? Claro si puedo saber -El propuso ir al cine o al parque acuático, me llamará para que le confirme, pero creo que me decidiré por el parque acuático, adoro la adrenalina – es tan linda, veo que está emocionada, en verdad quiero preguntarle por qué le acepta a él y no a mí Ensayamos mucho, Rich me felicito por que ahora ya mis pasos son naturales, nos avisó que cuando regresemos vamos a empezar con la coreografía. En verdad me sentí muy orgulloso, el tiempo pasó volando, el reloj seguía su curso, ya casi eran las 7pm y no la volvería a ver. Tendría que esperar hasta enero para verla, no puedo permitírmelo, necesito conseguir su número o alguna forma de encontrarla. -Bueno creo que eso ha sido todo, nos vemos de aquí luego de las fiestas, espero que practiquen, que tengan una linda Navidad y Feliz y próspero año nuevo -Tú también Rich –dijo Alex abrazándolo -Linda navidad Rich – le dije abrazándolo también -Les dejo chicos, tengo que ir de volada -Adiós-dijimos al mismo tiempo -¿Cuáles son los planes para esta navidad?- le pregunte -La verdad no estoy segura que tengan preparado en mi casa, lo único que estoy segura es que tengo que llamar a mi familia en noche buena -Pues espero que tengas una linda navidad -Gracias Josh, yo espero lo mismo para ti – Vamos Josh pídeselo, tienes que conseguir su número -¿Y qué piensas hacer ahora que puedes descansar? -Pienso leer -¿Leer? -Si quiero leer mis libros favoritos, quiero hacerlo en inglés, ya pude conseguir los pdf en este idioma -¿Cuáles son tus libros favoritos? -Puedes adivinar, pues tú actúas en sus películas -Tributo? – asintió con la cabeza, waooo tenemos muchas cosas en común, ella ama leer como yo, y por lo que veo tenemos los mismos gustos literarios -Bien pues tenemos muchas cosas en común – y me acabas de dar una gran idea -En verdad amo esos libros, son mi obsesión -¿Alguna vez has pensado en actuar Alex? -Lo he hecho, cuando estuve en el colegio, participe en obras teatrales, pero lo mío definitivamente es la medicina -Podrías algún momento ayudarme a practicar mis líneas -jajaja q chistoso, obviamente no podría, tu eres un gran actor, yo solo una aficionada -No digas eso, a ver ¿quieres intentarlo? -NO -Vamos, anímate, por mí – hice un puchero muy patético -Listo, si me prometes no volver a hacer esas feas muecas, dime que hago -A ver, eres tributo, que te parece si hacemos la escena de la playa, ¿te sabes el diálogo verdad? -Así que soy Katniss y tu Peeta, suena bien -Dale, empecemos desde que nos quedamos solos para vigilar, siéntate aquí – le ofrezco mi mano para sentarnos – ahora apoya tu cabeza en mi hombro – ella lo hace y siento como me estremezco con su cercanía- y ACCIÓN Tomo un respiro y empiezo - Katniss, no tiene sentido fingir que no sabemos lo que el otro está intentando hacer – suspiro - No sé qué clase de trato crees haber hecho con Haymitch, pero deberías saber que a mí también me hizo promesas, así que creo que podemos asumir que le mintió a uno de los dos Ella levanta su rostro y me mira con esas hermosas joyas marrones -¿Por qué dices esto ahora? - Porque no quiero que olvides lo diferentes que son nuestras circunstancias. Si tú mueres, y yo vivo, no me queda ninguna vida de regreso en el Distrito Doce. Tú eres toda mi vida – siento como si en verdad me encontrara en esa situación, como si mis palabras fueran reales - Nunca volvería a ser feliz - suspiro - Es diferente para ti. No digo que no fuera a ser duro. Pero hay otra gente que haría que tu vida mereciera ser vivida – como no tengo un guardapelo que darle asi que continúo -Tu familia te necesita, Katniss…. Nadie me necesita de verdad a mí -– Yo si - dice, en verdad siento como si sus palabras son reales, no sé si estoy perdiéndome en sus ojos o está actuando muy bien - Yo te necesito – siento que no sabe qué hacer, se supone que debe besarme, debe ser incomodo pero es mi oportunidad, siento esa corriente entre nosotros, los 2 seguimos viéndonos a los ojos Me acerco, tomo su mejilla, siento como nuestros alientos se mezclan, siento como todo mi cuerpo está en alerta y al mismo tiempo desesperado porque esto ocurra, siento en mi mano el calor de su rostro, ella cierra sus ojos sabe lo que voy a hacer y va a permitírmelo -Olvide mis llaves – nos sobresaltamos cuando Rich entra al salón, algún día lo asesinaré por inoportuno, se da cuenta de nuestra posición y de que fue imprudente - ¿Interrumpí algo? Siiiiiiiii – No, ya nos íbamos verdad Josh? -Sí, nos quedamos charlando – le agarre de su mano y la lleve fuera, la conduje por las escaleras, ella me siguió, me di cuenta que aún le sostenía de la mano. Cuando salimos del edificio no sabía qué hacer, no quiero soltarla, no quiero dejarla ir, quiero besarla, esta niña se metió bajo mi piel, me ha quitado el sueño y la tranquilidad y lo peor es que ella no lo hizo a propósito, es tan pura que no sabe lo que provoca en mí, los pensamientos tan cursis y a la vez tan morbosos que tengo con ella. -Alex, por suerte no te has ido – mierda, quien diablos es este ahora, ella soltó mi mano -Peter, ¿Qué haces aquí? -Vine por ti, para irnos juntos a casa, bueno primero vamos por una pizza - ¿Qué? Otro que tiene más oportunidades que yo, ¿Por qué todos están por encima de mí?, estaba a punto de invitarla otra vez, de llevarla a casa, de pedirle su número celular, diablos, de besarla -Buena idea pequeño, por cierto él es Josh El me extiende su mano, yo hago lo mismo – Mucho gusto, soy Peter vivo con Alex, verdad mi vida? ¿Mi vida? ¿Qué diablos es esto? Él es su novio, pero ella dijo que no tenía -Hay mi amor, le avisaste a tu mamá?- él niega con la cabeza – Pues llámale y dile que llegaremos tarde y que no prepare nada para nosotros El saca su celular y hace la llamada, camina unos pasos para poder conversar con más privacidad-¿Quieres venir Josh?- ¿qué diablos? ¿En serio me está invitando? Después de que me miente, de que casi me besa y tiene novio -No puedo en verdad, tengo que ir a recoger a mi hermano – diablos, quería gritarle y mi tono fue más de disculpa -Bueno será otra vez, hubiera sido bueno que vinieras, Peter es genial, yo lo quiero mucho -¿Cómo lo conociste?- me entro la curiosidad, es obvio que él es de EEUU -Vivo en su casa, con él y su mamá, como te comente el otro día él es como mi hermano- Mierda, es verdad, ella me hablo de un tal Peter, los celos me cegaron, no debí juzgarla tan rápido, es obvio que ellos se tratan así de cariñosos, yo lo hacía con mi mejor amiga -Muy bien, ya le avisé, ¿nos vamos? – Paso su brazo por el hombro de ella - ¿Josh quieres venir? Si quiero ir, pero como se lo digo para que no se dé cuenta que lo que dije sobre mi hermano era mentira -No puede, tiene que ir por su hermano – diablos, yo y mi bocota – Vamos Peter, nos vemos Josh, que tengas una linda navidad -Adiós Josh, mucho gusto conocerte – dijo Peter -Adiós Peter, adiós Alex – vi cómo se iban abrazados, en verdad soy un gran idiota, ella me hace un gran idiota, pero se lo que voy a hacer para llegar a ella. Tengo el regalo perfecto aunque tengo que moverme rápido si quiero conseguirlo. Además sé que el miércoles nos veremos. Estoy seguro de ello.[Chapter 6] Capítulo 6 Fue una mi linda navidad, en verdad cenar con Pool, Luise, Kristin y Peter fue muy bonito, ellos son tan buenos conmigo no sé cómo pagárselos, en noche buena llame a mi familiar que sabría que estarían reunidos en mi casa como todos los años. Me dijeron qué me extrañan y que esperan que pronto regrese, las lágrimas cayeron mientras me despedida. Ahora estoy desfilando para Peter en la ropa que usare mañana, creo que él está más emocionado que yo. Según Peter quiere verme feliz con alguien además de que si me enamorara me quedaría en EEUU para siempre. -¿Qué tal esto? – digo usando unos jeans negros y una blusa rosa ajustada en el busto y holgada el resto, que me encanta -Definitivamente esa blusa es la que debes usar, pero los jeans no estoy muy seguro – dice examinándome - ¿Qué tal si te pones unos shorts y luces tus piernas? Además mañana hará buen clima -¿Tú crees? ¿No es muy atrevido? -Para nada, Alex tienes unas hermosas piernas, debes lucirlas, créeme, lo volverás loco -Sabes que mi plan no es ese -Pero no tiene nada de malo exhibir la mercancía -jajajaja Estás loco, déjame me cambio y veremos si me animo – y así es como decidí ir, en verdad era un día muy soleado, perfecto para pasar en el parque acuático, subir en los juegos extremos. Estoy llegando a la entrada cuando veo a Pablo apegado a la pared esperándome -Hola – le digo -Waooo Alex, estas preciosa -Gracias, tú también estas muy bien – lo examino, ahora me doy cuenta que tiene unos encantadores ojos verdes, rodeado de unas pestañas muy largas, su piel es muy blanca y tiene barba. Yo solía molestarlo como hombre lobo porque un día venia sin barba y al siguiente la tenía nuevamente. Su cabello es un poco rizado, es del color de mi cabello, un castaño oscuro. Él es de origen venezolano, pero toda vino a vivir con sus padres aquí, por eso está estudiando inglés para poder ingresar a la universidad. El me mira con sus ojos muy abiertos, no puedo creer que Peter tenía razón, por primera vez en mucho tiempo me siento bonita, este niño que en verdad es muy lindo física y sentimentalmente está babeando por mí, literalmente. -Pablo? -Perdón, me puse a pensar en que en verdad eres muy hermosa y que no puedo creer que hayas aceptado mi invitación – me sonrojo -Bueno la verdad no creo que sea la gran cosa -No digas eso – me toma del mentón y me hace mirarlo – eres muy especial, no quiero que esto arruine nuestra amistad pero tengo que decírtelo – toma una bocanada de aire – Me gustas, mejor dicho, me encantas, amo tu forma de ser, tu tenacidad, tu sutileza, tu pasión, por eso es que no me he dado por vencido, quiero luchar porque me aceptes, no me importa la distancia yo en verdad te quiero, mi único deseo es que me correspondas -Pablo, yo….- pone su dedo en mis labios -No tienes que decir nada ahora, solo quiero que disfrutemos este día como los buenos amigos que somos – me agarra de la mano – Vamos, ya compre las entradas Me lleva adentro, la verdad al inicio me sentí un poco incomoda, pero él hizo que esto cambiara, subimos a muchos juegos, en verdad a los tiempos que no disfrutaba tanto, recordé las horas que pasaba con mi amigo Santy jugando básquet, aunque yo era pésima, futbol, peleas, play station, en verdad es un gran día; no pensé que sería así. -Bueno antes de seguir recorriendo creo que deberías ir a tomar algo, es un día caluroso -Acepto la invitación por la sed me está matando – le digo sonriendo y el me jala hacia la cafetería, no me había dado cuenta hasta ahora pero todo el día hemos andado de la mano, me siento mal, no quiero que piense que es algo que no es, pero debo admitir que me siento cómoda Llegamos a la cafetería y el jala una silla para que me siente, todo un caballero -Bien preciosa, ¿Qué quieres tomar? – sonrío ante su halago -Creo que tomaré un granizado, pero si yo invito -Nada que ver, yo te invite así que todo corre por mi cuenta y no quiero discutir sobre eso -Bueno para la próxima yo invitaré y tendrás que atenerte a mis mismas reglas -Ya veremos, pero lo que me alegras es que habrá una próxima vez, eso quiere decir que después de todo no te aburrí mucho hoy -Pablo nunca me aburres, y te agradezco en verdad hoy ha sido un día estupendo Él se acerca a mí, toma mi mentón y sé que lo va a hacer, va a besarme y la verdad no sé qué hacer, no sé si debo corresponderle o rechazarle. No quiero ser hipócrita yo aún tengo metido a alguien más en mi corazón, pero al mismo tiempo quiero darme una oportunidad sin importar lo que pase en un futuro. Siento como sus labios están cerca, nuestros alientos mezclándose y decido que me dejaré llevar -Alex, ¿Qué coincidencia? – no puede ser, que hace él aquí, nos separamos rápidamente y giramos para encontrarnos con Josh -Hola Josh, ¿Cómo así por aquí? -Vine con mi hermano a pasar el día, y te vi, espero no haberles interrumpido -No tranquilo- dice Pablo, sé que está molesto -Bien, si no les importa podemos unirnos a ustedes, no es muy divertido estar solo los 2 - ¿lo dice en serio? ¿Por qué esto me suena a que no es coincidencia? -Claro no hay problema, ¿Dónde está tu hermano? – pobre Pablo, aunque sé que la idea no le agrada siempre es cortés -Fue a traer unas bebidas- dice señalando hacia la fila frente al mostrador, tengo que hablar con Josh en privado -Por cierto Pablo, ¿te importaría ir por nuestros granizados? -No claro que no, ahora voy, enseguida regreso – veo como no quiere dejarme sola, pero no tiene manera de quedarse así que se dirige a la fila -Ahora si ¿dime que haces aquí Josh? -Ya te dije, vine a pasar con mi hermano ¿Qué coincidencia? -No me vengas con eso de coincidencia, tu bien sabias que estaría aquí con Pablo, fui una estúpida por decírtelo, confié en ti, lo que no entiendo es por qué estás aquí – es verdad, no sé qué hace él aquí, pero estoy muy enfadada -Perdóname si interrumpí algo entre tú y tu noviecito – me dice en un tono muy irónico – pero soy libre de estar donde quiera, me pareció una buena idea venir aquí, ni siquiera recordé que tú me lo habías dicho, ¿piensas que yo paso pensando en todo lo que dices? Mi mundo no gira en torno a ti Alexandra - auch, eso me dolió, no sé precisamente porque, ¿esperaba yo que él pensara en mi como yo pienso en él? ¿En verdad tenia esperanza de gustarle? - si quieres me voy, no tienes porque aceptar mi invitación para unir nuestros grupos -No, perdóname Josh, tienes razón, tú puedes estar donde quieras, olvida lo que te dije, y no tengo problema con que se nos unan – lágrimas amenazaban con salir de mis ojos, porque me afectaron esas palabras, siento algo que oprimió mi pecho -Perdóname Alex – dice acercándose – No quería ser tan grosero, pero no sé que tengo – que quiere decir, ¿se siente mal?, pasa su mano por su cabello como señal de frustración – Perdóname, lo que menos quiero es hacerte sentir mal, pero no pude evitarlo, verte con él me puso de malas -¿Por qué? – en verdad no lo entiendo, no entiendo porque me dice esto, ni el mensaje que trata de trasmitirme -Te prometo que hablaremos de esto, pero no ahora, no es el lugar, además ahí viene mi hermano - acaricia mi mejilla – te prometo que lo hablaremos, confía en mi -Hola Alex, un gusto volverte a ver – Connor llega con 2 bebidas, se acerca y me saludo con un beso en la mejilla -Igualmente Connor, no tuve la oportunidad de agradecerte lo que hiciste por mí -No tienes nada que agradecer – dice sentándose frente a mi junto a Josh – además era lo menos que podía hacer luego de que mi hermano casi te deja medio muerta -jajaj No exageres no fue para tanto – le digo -Ni lo recuerdes, que me siento mal por ello, además me costó mucho hacer que me perdone -Hubiera sido más rápido, si fueras un poco humilde -Alex, no quiero pelear contigo, pero en verdad no sabes cómo lo lamento -Ya olvídalo -Aquí tienes tu granizado – Pablo puso mi bebida sobre la mesa, se sienta a mi lado y estira su brazo atrayéndome hacia él como un abrazo, no sé porque me siento que estoy en medio de una disputa de propiedad, y yo soy la razón e ella -¿Ahora a dónde vamos?- pregunta Josh -Bueno yo tengo tiempo solo para un juego más, prometí llegar pronto a casa – miento, peor no pienso quedarme aquí para ver un pelea de niños posesivos -¿te parece si vamos a la montaña rusa? – me pregunta Pablo, ignorando las miradas de Josh -Perfecto, ¿Qué opinan ustedes? -Yo me apunto – dice Connor – quiero un poco de adrenalina -Entonces vamos, espero que la fila no esté muy larga - Pablo se levanta y agarra de mi mano, por primera vez en todo el día me siento incomoda con esta acción, no quiero que Josh piense mal, ¿Qué diablos? ¿Qué me importa lo que Josh piense? Es mi vida, como dijo él mismo: no le interesa lo que yo haga. En un impulso paso mi brazo por la espalda de Pablo, a él lo sorprende pero pasa su brazo alrededor de mis hombros. Caminamos mientras hablábamos de lo emocionante de la montaña rusa, Connor y Josh venían tras nosotros, por suerte compramos rápidamente las entradas y todo gracias a Josh a quienes sus admiradores le cedieron el puesto. Llego nuestro turno de subir, yo quería ir en la fila de enfrente, yo me senté en una esquina y antes de que me diera cuenta Josh se sentó a mi lado, seguido de Connor y Pablo al otro extremo. -Bien aquí vamos – dijo Josh cuando el carrito que nos llevaba empezó a ascender Cuando llegamos a la parte más alta estaba muy emocionada, tiene una hermosa vista, miro abajo y siento la adrenalina empezar a circular por mi sangre 3,2,1 siento como el aire choca con cmi cara, sostengo la respiración, mi corazón ha parado, esto es como volar, es fantástico Llegamos abajo y nuevamente a toda velocidad entramos en los otros obstáculos, curvas, subidas y caídas. Siento como la mano de Josh me sujeta. Pero no la agarra simplemente, si no la toma y la engancha sus dedos a los míos, veo que tiene los ojos cerrados, cuando permito su mano el paso entre mis dedos, los abre y tengo una intensa mirada de ese hombre tan hermoso e inalcanzable para mí. -Eso fue genial – dijo Connor cuando el carrito paro, me solté del agarre de Josh y Pablo rápidamente corrió a ayudarme a bajar -Fue Genial, estimulante – levante mi mano a Connor en señal de que la chocara y lo hizo -Claro como uds no tienen miedo- dice Josh -¿Tú lo tienes? -La verdad no es miedo, digamos que no es muy cómodo la combinación altura + velocidad -No esperaba que Josh Hutcherson tenga miedo a algo -Ya dije que no es miedo – todos reímos ante la indignación de Josh -Bueno es hora de irme -No Alex quédate un poco más – Pablo se acerca a mí abrazándome nuevamente -No puedo, en verdad, pero la próxima vez nos subiremos en todos los juegos, así nos tome toda la noches – le digo a Pablo, a quien su rostro se ilumino con una gran sonrisa, miro a Josh y trae una cara de pocos amigos -Bueno entonces voy contigo – se ofrece Pablo -No tranquilo, estaré muy bien, no me sentiría que hagas todo ese recorrido cuando tu casa queda en el lado opuesto que la mía -Sería todo un placer -No, por favor, no te preocupes, te debo mucho, hoy fue fantástico -Ok, pero promete que me llamarás en cuento llegues -Prometido -Nosotros también nos vamos - dice Josh – perdonen si les dañamos sus día, no pensamos en que esto era una cita -No te preocupes, fue una salida de amigos – digo y veo cómo cambia la expresión de Pablo -Adiós Alex, un gusto volverte a ver, espero que no sea la última vez que nos veamos -Lo mismo digo Connor -Adiós – dice Josh de una forma muy seria -Adiós chicos, cuídense – les digo, ellos se despiden de Pablo y se van -Bueno entonces, ya que no quieres que te lleve a casa, te acompaño hasta la salida – el parque tenía 3 salidas, a Pablo le convenía ir por la salida Norte y a mí por la salida Este -Claro – caminamos en silencio y rápidamente llegamos al lugar donde cada uno iría por su lado -Muchas gracias por acompañarme y por este día -No hay de qué, pero recuerda que me prometiste salir nuevamente conmigo -Claro que lo haremos- le guiño el ojo, es un reflejo que no puedo evitar como morderme el labio cuando estoy nerviosa, yo sé que es coqueto pero no me doy cuenta que lo hago Él se acerca nuevamente, va a besarme, y ahora siento que no es correcto, no sé porque antes está dispuesta a hacerlo. Simplemente giro y sus labios chocan con mi mejilla, él entiende mi indirecta por que no insiste en besarme -Espero con ansias nuestra próxima salida – dice susurrándome al oído – Nos vemos Alex, no olvides llamarme en cuanto llegues -Te llamaré – le digo, él toma mi mano y besa mis nudillos – Adiós – él gira y entra nuevamente al parque para atravesarlo y llegar más rápidamente a él Empiezo a caminar hacia mi casa, camino lentamente, necesito pensar que fue todo eso que sucedió con Josh y Pablo. Tengo mucho tiempo para llegar a mi casa. Sé que Kristin y Peter llegaran hasta las 8pm y apenas son las 5h30pm -Alex – no otra vez, que quiere ahora[Chapter 7] Capítulo 7 ¿Celos? ¿Celos? ¿Es eso lo que sientes, Josh? Pareces un acosador, siguiéndola hasta su cita, mirándola desde lejos y embaucando a tu hermano en esto. La miro en verdad esta hermosa, su blusa rosa que la sienta de maravilla, esos pantalones cortos que lucen una hermosas y provocativas piernas (que por cierto quisiera besarlas), su cabellos suelto cuales rizos se mueven con el viento. Es hermosa, es preciosa y se ha convertido en una obsesión para mí. Veo como él se acerca a ella, va a besarla, no lo puedo permitir, así que tomo valor y me acerco a ellos. Sé que ella está enojada, ella es muy lista sabe que no es coincidencia. Ella se deshace de Pablo y sé que me va reclamar el porqué de mi presencia -Ahora si ¿dime que haces aquí Josh? -Ya te dije, vine a pasar con mi hermano ¿Qué coincidencia? – si te estoy siguiendo, no podía permitir que ese estúpido te bese -No me vengas con eso de coincidencia, tu bien sabias que estaría aquí con Pablo, fui una estúpida por decírtelo, confié en ti, lo que no entiendo es por qué estás aquí – ni yo sé que hago aquí, bueno si lo sé, pero no quiero admitirlo ¿Por qué ella esta tan enfadada? ¿Quería algo con ese estúpido? ¿En verdad ello lo prefiere por encima de mí? -Perdóname si interrumpí algo entre tú y tu noviecito – no puedo ocultar mi furia – pero soy libre de estar donde quiera, me pareció una buena idea venir aquí, ni siquiera recordé que tú me lo habías dicho, ¿piensas que yo paso pensando en todo lo que dices? Mi mundo no gira en torno a ti Alexandra – ¿lo hace? Pareciera que sí, que esta niña vino a cambiar mi mundo y encima me desprecia, pone a todas las personas sobre mí - si quieres me voy, no tienes por qué aceptar mi invitación para unir nuestros grupos -No, perdóname Josh, tienes razón, tú puedes estar donde quieras, olvida lo que te dije, y no tengo problema con que se nos unan – lágrimas amenazaban con salir de sus ojos, en verdad le afecto, quizás ella también siente algo por mí, si es así porque está aquí con él, y estuvo a punto de permitir que la besara -Perdóname Alex – digo acercándome, me siento mal, fui grosero, ¿porque ella solo recibe lo peor de mí? – No quería ser tan grosero, pero no sé qué tengo – es verdad, me siento frustrado, no sé qué siento, no sé qué debo hacer ni cómo reaccionar con ella – Perdóname, lo que menos quiero es hacerte sentir mal, pero no pude evitarlo, verte con él me puso de malas – Celoso, eso es lo que tengo -¿Por qué? – no me lo preguntes, ni yo sé porque -Te prometo que hablaremos de esto, pero no ahora, no es el lugar, además ahí viene mi hermano - acaricio su mejilla – te prometo que lo hablaremos, confía en mi – y así lo hare, cuando en verdad me aclare a mí mismo lo que siento La veo con él y siento como mi sangre hierve, ella lo abraza, y él más contento no puede estar. Por qué no puedo ser yo quien la tome entre mis brazos, ¿Por qué ella no me lo permite? Mierda, esta mujer me hace sentir frustrado, ella ataca directamente a mi ego. Subimos a la montaña rusa, antes de que Pablo se dé cuenta me senté a su lado. No soy amigo de las montañas rusas, no es miedo, pero siento que esta mezcla de velocidad y altura no me agrada. Cuando descendemos a toda velocidad, siento que me voy a salir del asiento. Busco algo de dónde agarrarme y encuentro su mano, afianzo mi agarre, quiero sostenerla como si me perteneciera así que trato de enganchar nuestros dedos. Cuando ella me lo permite abro mis ojos. Y siento como todo el mundo desapareció, ella me mira dulcemente, sus rizos se alborotan por la velocidad, pero a mí no me importa, la tengo a mi lado para disfrutarla. Cuando nos despedimos quería huir de ahí, no soportaría verla besándolo. A pesar de mi interferencia ellos tuvieron una cita y lo más normal es que al final de ella se besen. Camino furioso fuera del parque -Tranquilo hermano, espera, ¿Qué te pasa? -Nada -Y por nada estas furioso -¿no sé qué me pasa? -Te gusta esa chica y estas celoso -Ella es tan frustrante, me dice que no quiere salir con nadie, rechaza todos mis coqueteos y propuestas y sale con ese -Josh, tómalo como un consejo y no metas a tu ego en esto -¿Qué tiene él que yo no? Soy un buen partido, puedo hacerla disfrutar, soy famoso, tengo dinero -Josh alto, ¿desde cuándo la fama y el dinero te hacen mejor que otros? Esta irreconocible hermano -Lo sé, pero es que todo lo demás ha fracasado, quizás la fama y el dinero la impresionen -Quizás no conozco mucho a Alex, pero sé que ella no está interesada en eso -¿entonces qué hago? -Ve, habla con ella y discúlpate por ser un estúpido y haber dañado su cita. Si quieres ganártela debes ser su amigo, y no apresurar lo pasos. Ya sé que estás acostumbrado a conocer a las chicas y llevarlas a tu cama, pero con ella eso no pasará. Así que si en verdad te gusta vas a tener que pasar por todos los pasos -Tienes razón ¿te importaría ir en taxi? -Tranquilo, nos vemos en casa, corre por ella antes de que se vaya, creo que se dirigió a la salida este -Te debo una hermano Corro hacia el parque, lo atravieso a gran velocidad, los veo a lo lejos. Mi corazón se detiene cuando veo que él va a besarla. Pero ella no lo permite, ¿por qué? Antes de que yo los interrumpiera ella iba a besarlo también. Veo que se despiden. Él entra al parque y yo me escondo para que no me vea. Salgo del parque y veo que ella se camina por la calle. Mintió, estoy seguro, mintió sobre tener que llegar pronto a su casa, ella quería estar sola, tal vez fue mi culpa. La incomode con todo lo de mi aparición en su cita. -Alex – se gira mí me queda mirando, su mirada está llena de enfado -¿Qué es lo que quieres Josh? ¿Me estas siguiendo? -NO, bueno si…. Tenemos que hablar -Sí que tenemos, podrías explicarme lo que paso hoy -Si en verdad, quiero disculparme por dañar tu cita y por todo lo cretino que me porté -¿Vas a decirme que te pasa? -Si… pero no ahora -¿Por qué, es un buen momento? -Porque ni yo sé que me pasa, por favor dame tiempo de analizarlo, te prometo que cuando lo sepa hablaremos de eso, por favor te pido que confíes en mí y me tengas paciencia – veo como su rostro se suavisa -Está bien Josh, confiare en ti, espero que no estés evitando el tema -Ahora permíteme llevarte a tu casa, por favor no me rechaces, quiero ser un buen amigo Veo que lo piensa – Esta bien – suspira – Vamos -Mi carro está en el estacionamiento del parque -¿Pensé que iríamos en tu moto?¿dónde está tu hermano? -Hoy vine en carro, pero prometo llevarte en paseo en moto, claro si tu aceptas… Connor tuvo que irse – tome su mano y la lleve al auto Hablamos sobre nuestras navidades en el camino, ella extraña mucho a su familia. No me atrevo a preguntarle cuando regresara a su país. Espero que falte mucho tiempo para eso. Llegamos a la entrada de una ciudadela privada. No podre conocer su casa, eso es malo, tenía la idea loca de que ella me invitara a pasar, y yo aprovecharía para besarla… diablos, es lo único en lo que pienso? Besarla? -Gracias por traerme, nos vemos en la práctica luego de año nuevo verdad? -Si – para mi mala suerte, faltan 5 días para eso; ella trata de bajarse del auto y yo la tomo de su mano – Espera, tengo un regalo de navidad para ti -¿Un regalo? ¿Para mí? ¿en serio? No debiste molestarte -Antes de que lo pienses no voy a aceptar que me lo rechaces, si no lo quieres lo tirare a la basura, ese regalo solo puede ser tuyo -¿En serio? Vale quiero verlo – me estiro y saco el paquete del bolsillo trasero de mi asiento -Toma -¿Puedo abrirlo? – asiento y ella empieza a romper el papel en que está envuelto. Miro como el libro hace efecto en ella, en verdad le gusto -Gracias Josh, en verdad me gustó mucho ¿cómo supiste que regalarme? -Dijiste que leerías \"Los Juegos del Hambre\" en pdf, no podía permitirlo, así que te lo compre, es original, además tiene una sorpresa dentro.. ábrelo – ella lo hace y se sorprende -¿Autógrafos? -Sí, hice que lo autografíen Suzanne, y todos los que actuamos en la película, puedes ver las firmas al inicio de cada capítulo y aquí- pasó la página donde tenían el autógrafo de Suzzane y Gary – están las formas de Jennifer, Liam y yo -Esto es hermoso Josh en realidad -¿Puedes leer mi autógrafo? En voz alto por favor -\"Josh H. Peeta, .No es raro que sepa que a pesar de lo fatal que me he portado aun me hablas. . . pero que no sepa cuál es tu color favorito? P.D: Quiero ser tu amigo, si me lo permites – ella termina de leer mi inscripción, sonríe – Violeta -¿Qué? -Mi color favorito es el violeta, aunque también me encanta el negro -¿Entonces me lo permites? – Ella me ve con cara interrogante – Ser tu amigo -Claro, yo ya te consideraba mi amigo – ella se acerca a mí y me abraza- Gracias, amigo, es de los más bellos regalos que alguien me ha dado, me siento mal por no tener nada para ti -Preciosa, me acabas de regalar la oportunidad de ser tu amigo, y más que todo me regalaste una hermosa sonrisa – sonrisa que me pertenecía porque era solo para mí La tenía entre mis brazos, algo que necesitaba todo el día, mejor dicho, desde que la conocí. Ahora era el momento, podría besarla, yo sé que me aceptará, pero Connor tiene razón, si quiero algo con ella lo mejor es avanzar escalón por escalón. Así conseguí su número de celular, la llamo cada noche para conversar sobre nuestro día, aunque no haya nada divertido que contar, me gusta hablar con ella. Las prácticas son muy cansadas, pero no las cambiaría por nada, estar cerca de ella me satisface, ella es la dueña de mis sueños desde los más cursis hasta los más húmedos y morbosos. El tiempo ha pasado volando, un mes se fue sin que lo sintiéramos, hoy es nuestra última práctica, la próxima semana tendremos que firmar los comerciales y hacer una sesión de fotos. No puedo creer que esto se terminara, pero lo tengo todo planeado, para hoy y para la otra semana. Será ahí cuando por fin la besaré, espero poder contenerme, quiero ir paso por paso pero la atracción que siento hacia ella a veces logra descontrolarse. -Bien chicos, ha sido un placer trabajar con ustedes, el día lunes nos vemos aquí, para ir al set y empezar las pruebas de cámara, nos vemos chicos -Adios Rich – dijimos al mismo tiempo -No puedo creer que ya firmaremos el comercial – dijo ella -Ni yo, el tiempo paso volando, no pensé que se acabaría tan pronto -Te extrañare compañero -No hablemos de eso, no quiero ponerme triste, además te tengo una sorpresa -¿Otra? – ya debe estar harta de mis sorpresas, todos los días le traía una flor, un dulce, una imagen, una historia, cualquier cosa para impresionarla -Sí, otras, vamos – le dijo sujetando su mano y llevándola hacia el parqueadero, llegamos a donde estaba estacionada mi moto -¿Bien, cual es esa sorpresa? -Un paseo en moto – le digo mostrándole el casco que debe usar -Eso es genial, estaba esperando que me invitaras a subir en ella Josh, te estabas tardando Me acerco y le pongo su casco, solo sentir el roce de mis dedos con su rostro me estremece el cuerpo, me subo en la moto y la ayudo a subir -Bien, nena, sujétate duro que esto va a ser fuerte -Ya sabes que me gusta lo fuerte –dice guiñándome el ojo -Ya veremos – acelero y salgo a la velocidad que más me puedo permitirme, ella me abraza y me siento como si flotara en las nubes.[Chapter 8] Capítulo 8 -¿A dónde vamos? – le pregunto a Josh -Confía en mí, te llevare a casa sana Josh condujo hacia las afueras de la ciudad, ya estaba oscureciendo -Por favor Josh, dime a dónde vamos? -Te lo diré cuando estemos allí Paramos junto a un local de comida para llevar -iremos a comprar unas cosas que necesito y después iremos al lugar que deseo conozcas- al momento en que vio como mis labios se abrían para realizar la pregunta que ya suponía rápidamente me interrumpió- cuando estemos allí lo sabrás antes no -si querías venir a cenar- le pregunte- bien podrías decírmelo. No entiendo cuál era el misterio – es verdad, ya hemos salido a cerna otras veces -ya lo veras, te gustará ¿confías en mí? -Tu sabes que sí – el sonrío- Entonces espérame aquí 10 minutos después regreso a con una bolsa donde supongo trae la comida, me ayuda subir a la moto nuevamente y me da la bolsa para que la lleve. Nos dirigimos nuevamente hacia la carretera a toda velocidad. Luego de un momento llegamos a un lugar desconocido, estaba oscuro. El estaciono la moto detrás de unos árboles de modo que los carros que pasaban por la carretera no la vieran -bien ya estamos listos, señorita por favor lleve esto- ordenó tendiéndome una caja de color rosa, que llevaba nuestra comida- ahora por favor súbase a mi espalda si es tan amable -¿Tu espalda? -Si por favor, confía en mí - sin hacerme de rogar más lo rodee con mis piernas para después enganchar mi mano izquierda a su hombro. Un agudo grito abandonó mis labios cuando Josh me ajustó a su espalda dando una especie de brinco que ocasionó que se riera bastante rato de mí – Que miedosa, cierra los ojos por favor Camino por unos 10 minutos llevándome en su espalda, en verdad debe tener fuerzas para poder cargarme de esta manera. -Llegamos -¿Puedo abrir los ojos? -Espera un momento – él me bajo con cuidado, me hizo avanzar unos pasos hasta que llegamos a una especie de barandilla -Ahora si puedes abrirlos El sitio que había elegido para nosotros esta noche era el famoso mirador de Denver, se le decía así porque era inexplicable como llegas a un sitio tan alto sin siquiera subir algún tipo de montaña es un lugar tan agradable y bello, constaba de un camino de piedras que te guiaba alrededor de todo el mirador, claro que lo que más atraía la atención era la manera en que se unían el cielo y con las luces de la ciudad logrando un espectáculo único e inigualable, estar allí con Josh lo hacía perfecto -¿Por qué elegiste este lugar hoy? -Por qué sigo buscando la forma de impresionarte, y ya no tengo mucho tiempo para hacerlo -¿Qué? ¿Sabe que 3 semanas regresaré a mi país? – espero que aunque no trabajemos, sigas aceptando mis invitaciones, no quiero perderte Alex -No lo harás – él se acerca a mí – Siempre seré tu amiga – su cara se sombrío un poco -No quiero hablar de cosas tristes, quiero disfrutar de la belleza de este lugar y de tu belleza ¿Qué te parece si comemos antes de que se enfríe la comida? – asentí y el empezó a sacar nuestros aperitivos -¿Cómo sabias que me gusta la comida china? - Adivine – dice muy complacido de sí mismo Terminamos nuestra comida mientras conversábamos sobre lo que tiene que hacer luego del comercial. Él volverá con las grabaciones de Sinsajo y otras películas. También piensa visitar a sus abuelos que viven en el extranjero. -Ya es tarde Josh, llévame a casa por favor -¿Porque cuando estamos juntos el tiempo vuela? – sonrío, él toma mi mano y regresamos hasta la moto. El regreso a casa fue tan rápido que la ida parecía haber sido una especie de \"expedición extrema por terrenos rocosos\", no quería que la noche acabara tan pronto, pero no quería preocupar a Kristin por llegar muy tarde. Aparcamos enfrente a la entrada de mi barrio -Te extrañaré, preciosa – dice mientras me ayuda a bajar de la moto, por alguna razón quedamos frente a frente, sus manos en mis caderas y nuestros rostros muy juntos, nuestras respiraciones aceleraron sus ritmos, y mi corazón quería salirme del pecho -Yo igual pequeño, nos vemos el lunes listos para firmar – él se ve triste, quizás porque esperaba que ese beso sucediera entre nosotros -Claro – medio un beso en la mejilla y partió. Cuando entre en casa estaba vacía. Encontré una nota de Peter diciendo que salieron a dejar unas cosas en las casa de Pool, que es hermano de Kristin, también decía que mi cena estaba en el horno. No tenía hambre así que decidí ir a mi habitación. Son las 10 pm, prendo mi computadora. Abro Facebook y twitter. Yo sigo a Josh en twitter aunque él no lo sepa. Miro su última publicación: \" más hermosa no puedes ser \" ¿a quién le dedicará eso? Josh está enamorado, bien por mi amigo, aunque siento como algo dentro de mí se retuerce. Prefiero ignorarlo y me meto a la ducha. Cuando salgo lista en mi pijama veo un mensaje en mi celular. Es de Josh -\"hace 1 hora que te deje en casa y ya te extraño pequeña! Siempre me saca una sonrisa, le respondo -\"que exagerado, no mentira, yo también pequeño\" - \"ya quiero que sea lunes\" -\"yo igual, por cierto quiero preguntarte algo\" Sera que le pregunto quién es la afortunada a quien dedica sus estados. No, no quiero saber, eso es muy personal, cuando él quiera contármelo lo hará. - \"claro, cualquier cosa pequeña, dime?\" - \"no era nada importante, olvídalo, yo también quiero que sea lunes, bueno te dejo porque me muero de sueño, duerme bien y sueña bonito. Besos xoxox\" Prefiero cortarlo antes de que insista en saber cuál era mi pregunta - \"duerme bien princesa, y claro que soñare bonito, porque tu estarás en mis sueños. Besos grandotes xoxoxo\" Porque lo hace?, eso me hace ilusionar, me hace sentir como si le interesara para algo más que ser su amiga. Desecho nuevamente esas ideas y me dedico a vaguear en Facebook - Alex, hola menxita, ¿Por qué ya no me escribes? Te olvídate de tu mejor amigo Santiago mi mejor amigo, en verdad lo extraño, con todo lo que ha sucedido últimamente no he tenido tiempo de escribirle. - Como crees eso horrible, he estado muy ocupada - Yaaaaaa, toda excusa es buena, mejor dime que no me kieres saber de mí =P - Baboso, ya sabes que te extraño demasiado - Yo también te extraño, todos te extrañamos, tus papis, tu ñaño, tu familia, mis papis, todos… sobretodo yo y Fernanda... ella me dijo que no ha podido contactarte últimamente - Es verdad, conseguí un trabajo que me ocupa todo el día, y de noche solo quiero dormir - ¿Cuándo regresas? I miss youuuuuu - No estoy segura de la fecha, pero será antes del 11 de marzo - Veras que debemos ser compañeros este ciclo - Claro, eso es obvio… bueno mi Santy, te dejo porque tengo sueño... muy pronto nos veremos por allá. Saludo a todos - Eso espero, solo te digo que nunca volverás a irte tanto tiempo, duerme bien, tkm Alex - Yo más Santy…! 3 J Decido recostarme en mi cama. ¿Cómo se lo diré a Josh? Tendré que decirle que me voy. ¿Cómo lo soportaré yo? Lo extrañaré demasiado. Se lo diré el viernes. Él me dijo que no haga planes porque iremos a festejar que terminamos el comercial. Ya era lunes, trabajamos todo el día en pruebas de cámara. En el comercial solo saldrá el rostro de Josh. Yo seré su pareja de baile a quien encuentra en medio de un bar y queda fascinada con el aroma de su perfume. Después de practicar la escena nos envían a casa. Josh me lleva en su moto, hacemos una parada en McDonalds donde compramos una hamburguesa para él y papas fritas para mí. El martes empezamos a grabar, hicimos la coreografía tal y como Rich nos enseñó. Todo salió perfecto. El día miércoles grabaríamos alguna escena que haya faltado. Así lo hicimos, según los productores, el comercial quedo perfecto. Muy pronto lo veremos en televisión. El día jueves llegamos a la sesión de fotos. No entiendo porque me maquillan si mi rostro no saldría en fotos. Nos avisan que todo está listo -Alex, estas hermosa -Gracias Josh, tu estas genial. Ese color definitivamente te hace lucir bien Hicimos la sesión de fotos. Yo siempre modelaba de espalda o perfil y mi rostro siempre escondido en el cuello de Josh. Luego de 2 horas de esto habíamos concluido. -Por fin, ahora me voy a quitar estos tacones – me dirijo a mi camarote -Espera – dice tomándome de la mano - Quiero aprovechar este momento. Tomate fotos conmigo por favor -Lo dices en serio -Claro, quiero fotos con la mujer más especial que he conocido – me sonrojo ante su comentario Nos tomamos muchas fotos juntos, haciendo poses ridículas, el cargándome. Yo cargándolo. En verdad fue muy divertido. Cuando terminamos el fotógrafo dijo que se las enviaría a Josh mañana -Prométeme que me sacaras una copia para mí -Claro, así cada vez que te olvides de mí recuerdes que nos divertíamos mucho -Josh nunca me olvidare de ti -Eso espero, no soportaría que lo hicieras – otra vez esos comentarios, que solo sirven para confundirme Luego de que nos cambiáramos, Josh y yo fuimos en mi moto hacia mi casa, otra vez pasando por McDonals. Mañana seria la cena donde nos mostraran lo que se ha grabado, las fotos y firmaremos los documentos legales donde se especifica que el contrato se ha cumplido. Luego de eso, saldré con Josh a no sé dónde ya que el joven \"sorpresa\" no quiere decírmelo. -Nos vemos mañana bonita, recuerda quiero que vistas súper elegante, como si fueras de fiesta -Ya me lo dijiste, ahí estaré. Algo más que deba saber -Nop, solo que avises que llegarás tarde, para que no estés preocupada por el tiempo -Josh, por favor… dime – hago un puchero -No hagas eso, me vas a convencer si sigues usando esos juegos. Mejor me voy antes de que suelte todo – se acerca y besa mi mejilla – Nos vemos mañana preciosa -Adiós pequeño Kristin me compró un vestido muy hermoso de color violeta con negro, estilo strapless muy sencillo pero encantador. Ayudo a peinarme de una forma que mi cabello cayera hacia un lado. Me maquilló, me presto un abrigo suyo Me acerque al espejo y en verdad me quede sin aliento. Lucia hermosa, realmente, nunca me había visto tan bonita y sexy. El vestido hacia lucir mis piernas largas y estilizadas, mis hombros descubiertos hacían lucir mi cuello, mostraba mucha piel si llegar a ser vulgar. Todo lo contrario, lucia muy elegante. -Estas preciosa – dijo Peter entrando a mi habitación – creo que debería contratarte un guardaespaldas esta noche -Gracias – aun no puedo creer que esa chica reflejada sea yo -Vine a decirte que el taxi está esperando afuera -Oh, me tengo que ir, nos vemos más noche -No te preocupes por llegar temprano, disfruta tu noche linda- me dijo Kristin mientras me abría la puerta de salida Llegue al restaurant donde sería la cena con los productores. El taxi se estaciono en la entrada y ahí lo vi. Josh en un hermoso traje de gala negro. Era como si fuera sacado de una revista. Me baje del taxi y el me miró expectante. -Que nadie me despierte, este es un hermoso sueño y me han enviado al ángel más bello para que fuera mi acompañante esta noche -Tú también luces bien pequeño, por cierto, Hola, buenas noches, ¿Cómo te va?, muy bien gracias por preguntas -Muy graciosa, debes admitir que como luces puedes dejar boquiabierto a cualquier hombre -Basta de halagos Josh, vamos adentro -Si me permites – ofrece su brazo, y yo engancho con el mío – Hoy todos me envidiaran Luego de firmar todos los papeles, y de la cena, dimos por cerrado el negocio. Debo admitir que fue una muy linda experiencia. Y aunque no me vuelva famosa como Josh, saldré en un comercial que reflejara mi arduo trabajo. Josh se despide de todos, también lo hago yo. Ahora si sabré cuál es su sorpresa. Me lleva en su auto hasta un edificio muy lindo. Entramos en él, tomamos el ascensor y subimos hasta el último piso. Cuando las puertas se abrieron, mostraron un hermoso paraíso nocturno, un jardín muy hermoso, con vista a toda la ciudad. Donde la tenue luz de las velas daban el toque perfecto del ambiente. En medio del jardín había una mesa para 2 personas, con la cena ya servida. Más allá había un balcón con un cómodo asiento para acomodarse y apreciar la vista. -Josh, esto es hermoso -Sorpresa preciosa, esta noche es solo para nosotros- me toma de la mano haciéndome entrar más en ese hermoso lugar - ¿Qué te parece si primero bailamos antes de cenar? -¿bailar enserio? -No salsa, algo más lento – el aplasta un botón del control que tenía en el bolsillo y música suave empieza a sonar- ¿me permite esta pieza señorita? -Claro señor – él toma mis manos y las sube hasta su cuello donde yo las mantengo, y posa sus manos en mi cintura, empezamos a movernos lentamente en torno a la música -Quizás ya te lo dije, pero estas hermosa esta noche -Tienes razón, ya lo dijiste- sonríe -Alex, es hora que te diga toda la verdad -La verdad sobre qué? -Que el día de tu cita con Pablo, si fui ahí porque sabía que tu estarías, aunque te lo negué -Ya lo sabía – me miro con cara interrogante – si no porque andarías llevando mi regalo, por cierto lo amo -Sí que eres perceptiva – suspira- eso no es todo, me preguntaste por mi comportamiento, y la respuesta es que estaba celoso -¿celoso? -Sí, Alex, me gustas, me encantas, no podía verte con ese tipo – no puedo creer lo que mes está diciendo – eres la persona más especial que he encontrado, necesitaba que supieras eso, me costó admitirlo, pero ahora no tengo miedo de decírtelo.. -Josh, yo…. -No déjame terminar, Alex te quiero para mí, sueño todas las noches contigo, cuento las horas para verte, quiero que esta noche me dejes demostrarte cuanto te quiero, no me importa tu respuesta, solo permítelo ¿sí? -Josh, tú también me gustas, eres una hermosa persona, pero no quiero arruinar nuestra amistad -Tu no arruinaras nada más de lo que ya lo he hecho, pero quiero que esto sea un espacio en el tiempo físicamente imposible, que sea nuestro momento- me toma de mis 2 manos – vamos a comer preciosa Comimos la cena en silencio, no porque estuviéramos incomodos, simplemente tenías mucho en que pensar. No puedo creer que le guste a Josh Hutcherson, él es tan lindo, tan perfecto. No sé porque la vida me recompensa de esta manera con él. -¿terminaste? – me pregunta -Sí, ya lo hice, estuvo delicioso, mis felicitaciones al cheff -Gracias, estuve toda la mañana en la cocina -¿En verdad tú lo preparaste? -Sip, y Connor me ayudo encontrando este lugar, y organizándolo todo -¿Connor sabe de esto? Agrádesele de mi parte, en verdad todo es tan perfecto -Preciosa, vamos al sillón, quiero que admires la vista – me llevo hasta el sillón donde la vista era hermosa, estaba muy cómodo, nos sentamos y el paso un brazo por mis hombros. No se cuánto tiempos nos quedamos así, pero siento que fue poco, el tiempo nunca era mi amigo cuando necesitaba que se detuviera – Tengo otro regalo para ti -¿En serio?¿y este porque? -Bueno la otra semana será San Valentín, y no puedo esperar para dártelo- saca un paquete de detrás del sofá y me lo da. Lo abro y no puedo creer, es otro libro \"Catching Fire\", abro y encuentro que también está autografiado, lo miro dulcemente – También lo hice firmar por Suzanne y todos los que participamos en la película, lee mi recado Mire la página siguiente a la portada, ahí estaban las firmas de Jennifer, Liam, Sam y Josh \"Desearía poder congelar este momento, justo aquí, justo ahora y vivir en él para siempre….Se mi Valentin, princesa\" -Josh eres genial, todo esto, me siento como una princesa en un cuento de hadas -Alex tu eres mi princesa, te mereces todo esto y mucho más- se acerca a mí y besa mi cuello, justo debajo de la oreja – quería hacer esto hace mucho – me susurra -Mmmmm- respondo dejándome llevar por esa deliciosa sensación El sigue repartiendo besos en mi cuello, siento como mi cuerpo se inunda de una sensación placentera. Recuerdos vienen a mí: Darío besándome de esta manera, el sin camisa y yo sin blusa, besándonos. Nuestros cuerpos juntos dejándose llevar por la pasión. -No sabes cómo te deseo – el susurra entre los besos que sigue dando a mi cuello. Su mano acaricia mi espalda. Los recuerdos siguen girando en mi cabeza: yo diciéndole a Darío que parara, que lo amo pero no creo que es el momento para entregarme a él ni a nadie. La mano de Josh sigue descendiendo por mi espalda, dejando fuego a su paso. Y un último recuerdo. Darío diciéndome: \"No sabes cómo te deseo, no acabes con esto…. Lo de nosotros es único… nunca me he sentido tan atraído por nadie\" y otro diciéndome: \"Entiende Alex, estas confundida, tú no me amas, lo de nosotros es solo atracción, por favor, no lo hagas más difícil.. simplemente déjate llevar… solo es sexo… algún día lo entenderás – se acerca a mí – no sabes cómo ni cuanto te deseo\", justo en ese momento la mano de Josh llego a mi trasero y lo apretó. Lo empuje contra el asiento liberándome, él me miro como si no entendiera lo que pasará. Lágrimas brotaron de mis ojos, eso es lo que él quería. Josh y Darío solo quieren sexo. No lo puedo creer, como pude ser tan ciega. El no quiere mi amistad, tampoco quiere tener algo más conmigo, solo quiere meterme a su cama, como todos los malditos hombres solo piensan en satisfacer sus deseos. Que estúpida que soy, porque baje mis defensas contra él, en verdad creía que un chico que lo tiene todo podría fijarse en mí, que ilusa -¿Alex estas bien? – dijo acercándose -No te atrevas a tocarme, Josh – digo saliendo del balcón dirigiéndome a la puerta. Tome mi abrigo y me lo puse -¿Por qué te vas? ¿Qué hice de malo? – me dice con voz de ¿tristeza? ¿frustración por no haber logrado su propósito? -Y todavía me lo preguntas, eres falso Josh, pensé que eras diferente, pero no sé porque me hice falsas ilusiones -Alex, no entiendo nada de lo que me dices -¿ah no? Piensas que soy tan fácil como para que me lleves a la cama – me mira con cara de vergüenza – piensas que provocándome podría rendirme a tus pies?, maldita sea Josh, pensé que eras mi amigo, confié en ti, te abrí mi corazón y tu…- mi voz se quiebra -Alex, no es lo que piensas, perdóname si mi comportamiento no fue lo correcto, no quería mandarte mano, pero es difícil controlarse, no me di cuenta lo que hacías… por favor, perdóname, soy hombre, nuestros instintos nos dominan a veces, te prometo que no volverá a pasar.. -Claro que no volverá a pasar, porque no pienso verte nunca más en mi vida.. -Alex, por favor, escúchame, hablemos princesa – dice acercándose a mí -No te acercas Josh o no respondo -No Alex, tienes que escucharme – él me toma de los hombros, y yo levanto mi rodilla y le doy un golpe en sus estómago lo que lo deja sin aire y cae al suelo. Aprovecho para irme. Subo en el ascensor y limpio mis lágrimas. Salgo corriendo del edificio, hago para un taxi que para mi suerte apareció enseguida, me subo en él. Cuando empieza a moverse veo a Josh asomando en la calle. No entiendo porque me sigue, debería rendirse al ver que no consiguió su propósito de meterme en su cama. Al parecer su ego de machi no le deja vivir con esta derrota. Llego a mi casa, por suerte todos están dormidos. Decido meterme en la cama. No quiero pensar en lo que paso, en lo ilusa e inocente que fui. Miro mi teléfono tengo 16 llamadas perdidas de Josh. Un mensaje de texto y uno de voz, ambos diciéndome que lo perdone y que necesita hablar conmigo. Doy vueltas por horas en mi cama. Decido prender mi laptop, entro en Facebook. Diablos, porque Josh tiene que estar en todos lados. Miro nuevas fotos de Josh y de mí en su moto y fotos de ayer cuando salimos del restaurant. Por suerte mi rostro no se ve claramente. Todas las fotos hablan de Josh y su misteriosa \"amiga\" a quien nadie ha podido reconocer. Apago frustrada mi pc. Vuelvo a intentar dormir. Pienso que por lo menos Darío fue sincero, él nunca me hizo creer que sentía algo más por mí, fui yola ilusa que se enamoró de él. Pero Josh fue tan hipócrita, haciéndome pensar que él me quería, creándome falsa ilusiones solo por sexo. Solo tengo que evitarlo por unos días más. Muy pronto regresare a mi vida ordinaria y este capítulo quedara cerrado.[Chapter 9] Capítulo 9 Su cuello está delicioso, he soñado con este momento, quiero provocarla, quiero que sienta lo que ella me hace sentir. Esta noche esta hermosa, realmente ni el brillo de la más grande estrella se compara a la luz que ella irradia. Siento como mi viejo amigo despierta, y mi sangre hierve en mis venas. Quiero a esta mujer, pero no solo por su cuerpo y mi lujuria. La quiero porque ella es el ser más perfecto y puro que existe. Siento su piel bajo las yemas de mis dedos. El contacto hace que el calor se extienda por mi cuerpo como oleadas de placer. Bajo mi mano por su espalda. Ella también disfruta del placer que le brinda mi contacto. No sé en qué momento mi mano apretó su trasero. Veo que reacciona mal y me aparta rápidamente. -¿Alex estas bien? – ¿está llorando? no quiero que te enojes por mi estupidez -No te atrevas a tocarme, Josh – sale del balcón, recoge su abrigo y camina hacia la puerta -¿Por qué te vas? ¿Qué hice de malo? – claro que sabes lo que hiciste, te propasaste con ella, la hiciste sentirse humillada, ESTÚPIDO -Y todavía me lo preguntas, eres falso Josh, pensé que eras diferente, pero no sé porque me hice falsas ilusiones – sus palabras me hieren -Alex, no entiendo nada de lo que me dices -¿ah no? Piensas que soy tan fácil como para que me lleves a la cama – más lágrimas caen por su rostro – piensas que provocándome podría rendirme a tus pies?, maldita sea Josh, pensé que eras mi amigo, confié en ti, te abrí mi corazón y tu…- su voz se quiebra -Alex, no es lo que piensas, perdóname si mi comportamiento no fue lo correcto, no quería mandarte mano, pero es difícil controlarse, no me di cuenta lo que hacías… por favor, perdóname, soy hombre, nuestros instintos nos dominan a veces, te prometo que no volverá a pasar.. – excusa para tonta, pero no sé cómo defenderme -Claro que no volverá a pasar, porque no pienso verte nunca más en mi vida... – siento como mi pecho se oprime, no puedo permitir que me deje -Alex, por favor, escúchame, hablemos princesa – me acerco a ella, quiero secar esas lágrimas -No te acercas Josh o no respondo – tiene que escucharme, no permitiré que piense algo que no es -No Alex, tienes que escucharme – la tomo de sus hombros, y ella levanto mi rodilla dándome un golpe en mi estómago que me deja sin aire y en el suelo. Ella se va. Trato de recuperarme para seguirla, ella uso el ascensor así que corro por las escaleras. Cuando salgo del edificio no la encuentro. No sé cómo pudo irse tan rápido. Son el más estúpido de los hombres. Como pude arruinar este hermoso momento. Diablos Josh, deberían golpearte más duro para que dejes de ser tan tonto. Tengo que hablar con ella. La llamo millón de veces y no me contesta. Le envío un mensaje:\" Alex, por favor, habla conmigo, perdóname\". Sigo llamando y decido dejarle un mensaje de voz -Alex, princesa perdóname por arruinar el momento y comportarme como un imbécil, por favor escúchame, necesito que hables conmigo Nada, ella no quiere saber de mí. Regreso al pent-house por mis cosas. Recojo mi chaqueta y encuentro el libro que le di. No quiso llevárselo. Lo toma y me lo llevo. Quizás pueda entregárselo. Quizás logre que me perdone. Ella tiene que escucharme. Salgo hacia mi casa, encuentro un paquete sobre mi escritorio. Lo abro y encuentro sus hermosos ojos. El fotógrafo envío las fotos que nos tomamos, ella y yo felices. Su sonrisa ilumina cada una de mis fotos, al menos tengo recuerdos. NO, ella tiene que escucharme, no puedo darme por vencido. ¿Por qué ella siempre recibe cosas males de mí? Abro mi mail y encuentro un correo de mi agente. Me envía fotos tomadas por paparazis, de Alex y yo andando en moto y de nosotros saliendo del restaurante esta noche. Mañana la buscaré y no descansare hasta que me perdone. Ella es la niña que quiero en mi vida y no dejare que mis estupideces me alejen de mi felicidad. Al siguiente día la busque en su ciudadela, no me permitieron pasar. Me dijeron que sin invitación no podría llegar a su casa. Y cuando avisaron que estaba buscándola mucho menos me lo permitieron. Seguía llamándola, enviándole mensajes de texto y de voz. Quizás me sirva probar por twitter. Espero que ella lo tenga, pero diablos no sé cómo buscarla, no tengo su mail. Busco a Rich y le pido que me ayude. El me ofrece esa información para la próxima semana. Los días pasan rápido. Hace una semana que no sé nada de ella. Todos los días me siento en una silla en el parque frente a la entrada de su ciudadela. Albergando la esperanza de verla y poder hablarle. A pesar de las horas y los días no la veo. Siento como mi corazón se hace chiquito. Es hora de irme, cuando me levanto para ir a casa lo veo. Peter, él tiene que dejarme verla. -Peter – le grito y él se detiene -¿Qué haces tú aquí´? ¿No has hecho suficiente daño? – sus manos se vuelven puños -Peter por favor necesito hablar con ella. Alex no quiere escucharme, no me deja explicarle -¿Qué le vas a explicar? Que quisiste meterla en su cama tan rápido que ni siquiera te permitiste en besarla en los labios, ni siquiera esperaste que ella estuviera segura de lo que siente – es verdad, aún no he besado esos labios, cada día me doy cuenta de lo canalla que fui con ella -Las cosas no son así, yo la quiero, no quiero perderla -Pues mal por ti porque ya la perdiste…. Y te digo con sinceridad, perdiste a la mujer más linda de este mundo - ¿crees que no lo sé? Sé que soy un estúpido no necesito que este tipo me lo recuerde -Por favor Peter, ayúdame, tengo que hablar con ella, decirle lo que siento -esa no es mi decisión Josh, si ella no quiere escucharte yo no intercederé por ti, y veré que sus deseos se cumplan – es imposible, él no me ayudara -Podrías por lo menos entregarle esto – le entrego el libro que le regale, en medio de todo ella lo olvido, quiero que lo tenga como un recuerdo mío, sé que a pesar de todo ella lo conservara. Dentro de él esta una nota mía pidiéndole que me perdone y una foto de los 2, estamos juntos, riendo. -Se lo entregaré pero por favor lárgate… no quiero tener que hacer que te largues a las malas -Gracias… solo dile que nunca me daré por vencido – me fui de ahí. Han pasado 2 semanas, y aunque la he buscado no he podido verla. Rich me consiguió su correo, la encontré en twitter. Le envíen mensajes pero veo que ella no lo usa. Que frustrante. Hoy intentaré nuevamente verla. Tengo toda la información sobre su casa. Le llevare un ramo de rosas y será yo el mensajero. Tiene que funcionar, necesito verla, hablarle, diablos, necesito que me perdone y sostenerla entre mis brazos. -Si ¿Qué desea? -Tengo un paquete que entregar a esta dirección – le entrego la tarjeta al portero, por suerte no me reconoce -Espere un momento – ingresa a la cabina junto a la entrada, llama por teléfono, me imagino que a avisar que tiene un paquete - Bien, llegue hasta el fondo, es la cuarta casa a la derecha – me abre la puerta y paso Camino muy lentamente, quiero correr hacia ella pero siento como mi corazón se quiere salir del pecho. Llego a la casa y toco el timbre. Sale una señora -bien, ¿Para quién es esto? -Es para la señorita Alexandra -Mmm pues creo que tienes que regresárselas a quien las envió, ella no está – mierda quería verla -Pero puedo dejárselas -No chico, ella ya no vive aquí -¿Qué? ¿Se fue? -No creo que sea algo de tu incumbencia, pero podrías decírselo al dueño de estas flores. Ella regresó a su país. Ya terminaron sus estudios y regreso a su antigua vida. Así que puedes llevarte ese ramo -No, tome, no puedo hacer nada con él, son suyas – ella recibe la flores, empiezo a caminar de regreso a la puerta -Oye chico, lamento que lo de ustedes haya terminado mal – ¿me reconoció?- a veces las cosas o salen como uno quiere-siento nostalgia en su voz - así tengas todo el dinero y la fama, Josh – entro en su casa La perdí, ella se fue, ella volvió a su vida, junto a su familia, a sus seres queridos. Donde empezara nuevamente y solo volteara la página y me olvidará. Siento como mi pecho se oprime en su recuerdo. Porque tuve que arruinarlo todo, prometí que no me daría por vencido pero no sé cómo hacer eso. No sé dónde buscarla, ni cómo hacer que me perdone. Perdí, eso es. Tengo que tratar de olvidarla como ella lo hará también. Solo espero que sea feliz, que sea verdaderamente feliz. Por qué yo no sé si encontrare a alguien como ella. Adiós princesa, fue un placer haberte conocido, y hubiera sido aún mejor si te hubieras quedado.[Chapter 10] Capítulo 10 Josh aunque me hiciste daño fue un placer haberte conocido, guardare los momentos lindos que vivimos como un tesoro. No te odio, nunca podría odiarte a pesar de todo. Me odio a mí misma por ser tan estúpida y haberte creído. Será como un sueño, después de todo no te volveré a ver. Siempre permanecerás en mi mente, pero es hora de pasar a página. Muy pronto volveré a verte Darío. Has sido la persona que más he amado en esta vida, y aunque tú no sientas lo mismo. Todos los días ha estado en mis pensamientos, aunque debo admitir que con Josh era diferente, él fue el único que logro dejarte en segundo plano en mis pensamientos. Debo agradecerte por ello Josh, te agradezco por el libro, en verdad es un muy lindo regalo que conservaré. Agradezco la foto que venía en él. Él y yo juntos en nuestro último día feliz, nunca nadie la verá, nadie sabrá que te conocí, atesorare esta foto... Como quisiera que todo eso hubiera sido real, ¿y si lo fue? Según su nota lo fue: \"Princesa, no tengo forma de llegar a ti, pero nunca me daré por vencido, estoy dispuesto a pasar todas las barreras y obstáculos para demostrarte que lo que piensas de mí es falso y que sepas en verdad lo importante que eres para en mi vida… SIEMPRE..! –JH\" No seas estúpida, no puedes volver a creer en hombres. Algún día encontraras a la persona que mereces. ¿y si esto es lo que merezco? ¿Qué hice tan malo que la vida me castiga? No, simplemente la vida me da la oportunidad de aprender a no confiar en todas las personas. -Se les solicita colocarse los cinturones de seguridad, en un par de minutos aterrizaremos, esperamos que hayan disfrutado su viaje, le deseamos una plácida estadía y pronto regreso – aquí voy, de regreso a mi vida, adiós Josh, ahora eres parte del pasado Luego de recoger mi equipaje salgo en busca de mi padrino. No le avise a nadie de mi regreso, solo a mis padrinos para que vinieran por mí y a mi mejor amiga. Quiero darles a todos una sorpresa. Mañana habrá una fiesta en la casa de uno de mis mejores amigos, Arturo, ahí estarán la gran mayoría de mis amigos, Fernanda me aviso sobre eso, y se va a asegurar de que mis amigos más cercanos estén presentes, incluyendo a Santiago y obviamente a su hermano, Darío, aunque no puedo considerarlo un amigo después de todo lo que hemos vivido ¿o sí? -Alex! – ahí está mi padrino, suelto mis maletas y corro hacia él, el me abraza y me levanta haciéndome girar – Mi niña, por fin estas de regreso, no sabes cuánto te extrañe – siento como mis lágrimas brotan y las de él también -Ñaño – en mi familia tratamos de ñaño o ñaña a nuestros tíos o tías – los extrañe muchísimo, pero ya estoy aquí Miro a su esposa – Madrina, la extrañe mucho, estoy feliz de verla -Alexita, no sabes como estábamos ansiosos por verte, no puedo creer que ya estés aquí – me abraza- más vale que no te vuelvas a ir, porque no te dejaremos, estos meses pasaron muy lentamente -¿mija llamaste a tus papás? – me pregunta mi tío -No ñaño, quiero darles una sorpresa -Pues te aviso, que se fueron de viaje con tu hermano, según me dijeron regresan pasado mañana ¿te quedaras con nosotros? -Hoy si ñaño, pero mañana quiero ir a mi casa, por suerte guarde mi llave de la casa, mañana habrá un fiesta de un amigo, quiero saludar a todos y de paso les doy una sorpresa a mis papis cuando regresen y me encuentren en la casa -Bueno, ahora vámonos que dejamos a los ñutos en el carro, no quiero imaginarme lo que pueden hacer solos – sonreí ante su comentario, eso quiere decir que los pequeños no han cambiado, siguen siendo unos demonios, hasta ahora nada ha cambiado Salimos del aeropuerto y empezamos el viaje. El aeropuerto internacional queda en la capital, yo vivo en una de las ciudades más grandes pero que queda a 5 horas de viaje en carro. Me siento tan nerviosa, parece que me hubiera ido toda una vida, y al mismo tiempo siento como si nunca me hubiera ido. Miro como llegamos a mi ciudad, a mi hogar, las cosas no parecen haber cambiado, son tal y como las recuerdo. Nunca me di cuenta que en verdad extrañe todo esto. La tranquilidad de una ciudad no tan grande e industrializada, todo lo contrario acogedora y muy hermosa. Mi ciudad es muy hermosa, debido a eso tiene gran turismo, y gente extranjera la elige como lugar de residencia para su vejez. Pase el día con mis padrinos, les debo mucho a ellos, por todo el apoyo que me han dado en mi vida, y también por la oportunidad que me brindaron con el viaje. Me levante temprano a preparar el desayuno con mi madrina, como siempre lo hacia cuando me quedaba en su casa, hablamos de muchas cosas que me ocurrió en el viaje, sobre los nuevos amigos, sobre Kristin y Peter, sobre el curso de inglés y también de chicos, aunque nunca le hable de Josh. A las 5 de la tarde ya me encontré en mi casa. Apenas me dejaron ahí empecé a recorrer cada habitación. No había cambiado nada. Entre en mi cuarto y todo estaba tal y como lo deje. Mis peluches, mi cama, mi escritorio, mi televisor, mis fotos de momentos felices pegadas por toda la pared, una punzada oprime mi pecho. Abro mi bolso y saco mi libro. Ahí está la foto de Josh y yo, juntos, felices….. no puedo ponerla con las demás, me prometí a mí mismo hacer como si no hubiera existido. Le avise a Fernanda que estaba en mi casa y 5 minutos después toco el timbre -Alex- me abrazo – maldita zorra, me vuelves a abandonar tanto tiempo y te juro que te ahorco – empezaba a sollozar -Yo también te quiero, Fer -Nada de yo también te quiero – dijo imitando mi voz – si te vas otra vez, llévame contigo, no puedo creer que ya regresaras, no sabes cuanta falta me hacia mi mejor amiga -Tú también me hiciste mucha falta – le dije sollozando -Bueno ya basta de lloriqueos, lo importante es que ya estás aquí de regreso, ahora seremos compañeras de la universidad -Bueno la verdad es que este ciclo solo tengo que coger ciertas materias para completar el tercer año, pero desde el próximo año cogeré la mismas materias que tú y Santiago -No me interesa, lo importante es que te tengo a 1 km de distancia, ya no a 800 mil, ahora vámonos a arreglar, que le dije a Santiago que nos pase viendo por mí casa a las 8h30pm -¿Le dijiste que volví? -Noooo, le dije que una amiga iría, dijo que llevaría a Darío para no estar tan solo y hacernos compañía- Mierda, la mire con cara enojada – no me mires así, más vale que lo enfrentes pronto, créeme Alex, él te extraño, se dio cuenta que también eres importante para él -¿Tú crees? -Sí, no digo que te ama, pero se dio cuenta que se portó como un estúpido, te extraña, siempre me pregunta por ti, además, sé que aún lo quieres, lo que uds tuvieron no se puede borrar, así el haya dicho que solo era atracción todos nos dimos cuenta que eso era mentira.. le mueves el piso menza, tanto como el a ti…. Y como te conozco también sé que asaste pesando en él todo este tiempo y no saliste con nadie ¿verdad? No sabía que responderle, era verdad, pase la mayor parte del tiempo pensando en él, pero cuando estuve con Josh fue diferente… pero no quiero hablar de eso, se supone que nunca paso que solo fue un sueño -OMG, ¿Quién es? Dime -¿Quién es quién? – la miro incrédula -El chico que conociste ¿Cómo se llama? Debió ser muy lindo para que te quitara de la mente a Darío -No hay ningún chico, como se te ocurre eso, me conoces, pase pensando en Darío y siéndole fiel -No sabes mentir – dijo burlándose – bueno si no quieres hablar, no lo hagas, pero bueno me doy cuenta que Darío aun te mueve el piso, deberías dejar de serle fiel… vive la vida muchacha, como antes de él… no son nada y cada uno se guarda para el otro -¿él se guarda para mí? ¿Qué paso con Nataly? -Es verdad, no te lo he dicho – toma aire- luego de que te fueras y él empezó a extrañarte, la dejo, ella no entendía porque y no quiso aceptarlo, en verdad era patética esa mujer, y él le dijo que era por ti, que ya no quería vivir en medio de mentiras, y le confesó que le puso los cachos contigo.. así que amiga tienes una nueva enemiga Eso me tomo por sorpresa. La dejo, él la dejo, y por mí. Siento como mi corazón late con fuerza. Él hizo todo eso por mí, me quiere, el siente algo más por mí. Fer y yo nos arreglamos, nos vestimos muy sexy. Ella tomo prestada ropa mía, la verdad regrese con más ropa de la que lleve, eso gracias a Kristin y su obsesión por las compras. Ella me peino de una forma que el cabello no cayera en mi rostro y todos mis rizos cayeran por mi espalda. Fuimos a su casa, que queda a una cuadra de la mía. Salude a sus hermanos y sus papas que me dieron la bienvenida. Luego sonó el timbre y sabía que la hora ha llegado. Fer salió primera, escuche la voz de Santiago y la de él, Darío. Cuando ella dijo \"les tengo una sorpresa\" sabía que era mi señal, y Salí. -Alex? – los 2 dijeron al unísono -Santy – mire sonriente a mi mejor amigo –No puedo creer que estés aquí – me abrazo y me hizo girar – te odio, ¿Por qué no me dijiste que volviste? -Llegue ayer, quería darles una sorpresa, te extrañe tanto menzilino -Alex – Darío me miraba estupefacto -¿Cómo estas Darío? Es un gusto volverte a ver – me acerque a saludarlo, con cada paso sentía como mi corazón se quería salir del pecho – ¿no vas a decirme nada? Me agarro de la mano y me jalo hacia la calle – denme un momento a solas, necesito hablar con ella – les dijo a los chicos, arrastrándome con él -¿Qué pasa?¿Que me quieres decir? – le pregunto mirándolo a los ojos, él me acurruca contra el cerramiento, poniendo sus manos a mis lados apoyándolas en la pared. De un momento a otro, siento sus labios sobre los míos, no lo vi venir, siento su calidez en todo mi cuerpo. Ese beso esperando por tantos meses, por fin se cumplió. Al inicio no sabía cómo responder, pero luego me deje llevar por las sensaciones, levante mis brazos y me colgué de su cuello. Él bajo sus brazos y los juntó en mi espalda, atrayendo más hacia él. Nuestro beso aumento de temperatura, se llenó de pasión, ansias, añoranza.. Mi corazón definitivamente saltaba de mi pecho, sentía la falta de aire pero no me importó, extrañaba a este hombre, extrañaba al amor de mi vida -Vaya ustedes sí que hablan, y yo que venía a prevenir una pelea sanguinaria – Santy nos interrumpió -Tú crees que perdería la oportunidad que he esperado por meses – le responde Darío sin dejar de mirarme -Bueno es mejor que nos vayamos – dice Fer, Darío toma mi mano y me jala contra él. Paso un brazo por mi cuello abrazándome, y yo paso mi brazo por su cintura. Que extraño se siente, es como si nada malo hubiera pasado entre nosotros, como si él nunca me hubiera hecho daño, lo único que puedo pensar es que estoy entre sus brazos, y espero que sea para bien. En el camino hacia la fiesta les conté mucho sobre mi vida allá, sobre Peter, Kristin. Cuando llegamos todos se asombraron y me dieron la bienvenida. En verdad me siento dichosa por ver que me han extrañado. Me hace sentir querida. Bailamos, como hace mucho tiempo no lo hacía. Era algo que necesitaba. Fer se aseguró de que todos estén presentes, incluyendo mi otra mejor amiga Melissa, quien nunca asiste a fiestas. Ya entrada la madrugada, nos pusimos a conversar, contar chiste y por último, KARAOKE. Volvió el dúo dinámico Alex y Mel. Extrañaba cantar con mi amiga. La verdad lo hacíamos muy bien. Empezamos con una canción de Ha-Ash y terminamos con una de Paulina Rubio (todo mi amor - www_youtube_com/watch?v=P-HKKB3iZRc). No eran nuestras canciones favoritas, pero para cantarlas eran muy buenas. Darío me acompaño a mi casa, Santy se adelantó a la suya, llego el momento de hablar. -Debo decir que estas muy hermosa – él rompió el silencio -Gracias – no sabía que más decir -Alex – suspiro- no sé cómo empezar esto, ya pudiste darte cuenta que te extrañe.. fui un estúpido, fui la persona más ruin por haberte dicho todas esas cosas antes de irte. No sabes cómo me arrepintió, tuviste que alejarte para darme cuenta de cuanto te necesito -Darío, yo… -No, déjame hablar a mí, sé que aun sientes algo por mí a pesar de todo, no lo merezco, pero tampoco quiero que lo dejes de sentir. Quiero ganarme tu amor, de la manera más sincera. Quiero que empecemos desde cero. Quiero ser tu amigo, y de ahí veremos qué pasa. Lo beso, yo sé que eso no es precisamente de amigos, pero lo necesito. Necesito sentirme querida, necesito sentirme deseada. Él corresponde a mi beso. Cuando nos alejamos el me mira interrogante. -Vale, empezaremos desde cero, olvidaremos todo, seremos amigos, pero no quiero perder esto – lo beso -¿Qué tal si somos amigos pero con beneficio? – levanto una ceja – Alex yo también necesito de tus besos, ambos lo necesitamos, pero en verdad quiero enmendar todo, hacerlo todo bien.. -Déjame ver si entiendo, seremos amigos, pero cuando queramos podemos besarnos, ok suena bien, es mejor no atarnos con ningún compromiso hasta que veamos qué pasa. Pero eso significa que podemos seguir con libertad – no sé porque pero quiero invadirle inseguridad y celos, y nunca sería capaz de meterme con nadie más aunque lo nuestro no sea algo serio -¿En verdad quieres eso? Libertad para poder esta con alguien más? -Sí, eso quiero, necesito estar segura de mí mismo cuando este contigo, creo que es mejor que tenga más relaciones, y saber qué es lo que quiero – miento, lo quiero a él -Bueno, entonces así será, pero haré todo lo posible para que te quedes conmigo Se acerca a mí, acaricia mi mejilla, y me besa. Es muy placentero sentirlo cerca, tenerlo entre mis brazos. Esto da inicio a una nueva vida. Donde no entrará ningún recuerdo desagradable, donde todo irá como lo tenía planeado, donde no estará ningún estúpido famoso que me dañe la vida, donde no estará Josh Hutcherson.[Chapter 11] Capítulo 11 Me despierto pensando en ella, como todos los días. Ella está en mis sueños, en mis pensamientos, en mis suspiros. Dos meses han pasado desde que no sé dónde está. Ella nunca me dijo de donde era y por más que he buscado no encuentro su paradero. La encontré en twitter pero no puedo ver su información, ella no acepta mi solicitud de seguido quizás porque no lo abre, o quizás porque no quiere saber de mí. Algo a lo que mi corazón no se resigna. Me levanto para ir al baño, cambiarme. Tengo que ir al aeropuerto, y a casa de mis padres en Kentucky. La otra semana viajaremos a la casa de mis abuelos en Latinoamerica. Ellos viven allí desde hace 2 años. En una pequeña ciudad, en comparación a las de aca, averigüe sobre ella y es el destino de preferencia para norteamericanos y europeos retirados. Una ciudad tranquila y muy hermosa. Voy a conocerla, iré por un par de meses, como quien descanso de mi trabajo. Solo viajaré con Connor. -Tan rápido te vas amor – Shannon se remueve entre las sábanas de mi cama, es mi exnovia, aunque ya no tenemos una relación, ella aun me busca, y terminamos en esta situación; después de todo soy hombre y tengo traspiés, suspiro, soy un hombre, un maldito hombre que por no contener sus instintos perdió una gran mujer -Ya te he dicho que no me llames amor, y es mejor que te vistas, en un rato me voy para el aeropuerto -Josh, no me trates así, sabes que me quieres, anoche fue.. uffff… la pasamos delicioso, si tu quisieras, esto fuera así por siempre -Shannon lo de anoche fue un error, un tras pie, estábamos tomados – suspiro – no volverá a pasar -De eso no estoy tan segura mi amor, tú me deseas tanto como yo – entro en el baño antes de que deje de ser un caballero y la saque a rastras de mi cama. Esta es mi vida ahora, rodeado de mujeres, ninguna que me haga sentir lo suficiente. Todos los días, soñando y buscando los besos que nunca nos dimos en otras. Salimos de mi apartamento y vamos a desayunar juntos. Luego la dejo en el suyo y me dirijo al aeropuerto. Horas después estoy en la puerta de mis padres timbrando. -Josh llegaste – dice mi madre -Hola mamá – la beso en la mejilla -Dios, hijo, que es esa cara, no me digas que sigues mal por esa chica?- me siento en el sofá de la sala -Mamá, preferiría no hablar de eso, en verdad, suficiente tengo con mi cerebro recordándola todo el tiempo -Mi pequeño, no creí que el amor te diera tan duro, pero tienes que avanzar, ella ya no está, y quizás nunca la vuelvas a ver – me abraza – yo sé que algún día encontraras a chica que te ofrezca todo lo que mereces y necesitas -Mama la necesito a ella – le digo frustrado, no sé cómo, no porque pero me di cuenta tarde que me había enamorado, había conocido el verdadero amor para luego perderlo – no sé dónde buscarla, ella nunca me lo dijo; incluso en las entrevistas le envío mensajes, para que sepa que la quiero, aún tengo la esperanza que ella me vuelva a mí, o por lo menos me diga dónde puedo encontrarla -Josh, no quiero decírtelo de esta manera, pero si no lo hago no reaccionaras – me toma de los hombros – déjala ir, ya no puedes hacer nada, si la vida no quiere que estés con ella pues así será, fue tu culpa, y no puedes hacer nada para remediarlo, lo único que puedes hacer es seguir Las palabras de mi madre retumbaron en mi cabeza, es verdad, fue mi culpa, pero no me doy por vencido, la vida no puede quitarme la esperanza de remediar las cosas, eso espero. Ya tenía todo listo para el viaje, hoy di una entrevista y como en todas últimamente deje un mensaje para ella. Espero que la vea, espero que se dé cuenta de cuanto la extraño y de cuanto necesito verla. Partimos hacia un nuevo rumbo, quizás este viaje me ayude a sentirme mejor, no quiero olvidarla, pero si quiero dejar de atormentarme. Luego de 5 horas de viaje llegamos a la capital de este país. Y luego de 5 horas en auto llegamos a la ciudad donde viven mis abuelos. En verdad es muy hermosa. Y la casa de mis abuelos es fantástica, no es una mansión pero es muy bella y amplia. Llegamos nos instalamos, en verdad es muy bueno tener a mis abuelos cerca. Ellos prometieron que conoceríamos la ciudad y otros lugares antes de regresar. Quieren contratarnos un guía debido a que por su trabajo andan atareados. Sim embargo nos mostraron los alrededores. Me sorprendió ver los paisajes de la ciudad, se situaba en un bellos valle, atravesada por ríos, a las orillas de los ríos estaban cubiertos de flores y un camino por donde corre y hacer ejercicio. Según me explicaban, en las mañanas la gente camina, corre o hace otro tipo de ejercicio. Todas los ríos se unen en un sector llamado \"El Paraíso\", es un hermoso parque donde hay un lago, jardines, canchas de futbol, basket y otros implementos para hacer ejercicio. En verdad muy hermoso. Junto a este parque estaba el campus de la facultad de medicina de una de las universidades de aquí, lo que inmediatamente me recordó a ella. Junto al campus está un hospital, y un poco más arriba un centro comercial. Es una ciudad muy linda, creo que disfrutare la visita. Con Connor hacemos nuestro itinerario para salir a conocer la ciudad y tratar de no perdernos hasta conseguir un guía. Todas las mañanas corremos por el \"Parque Lineal\" así les llaman aquí a la travesía a las orillas de los ríos; cada vez avanzamos más como quien conocemos la ciudad sin el riesgo de perdernos. Volvemos a casa siempre para el almuerzo o antes de la merienda, así podemos pasar tiempo con nuestros abuelos. He tratado de no pensar en ella, pero me resulta imposible, la veo en todos lados. En verdad me estoy volviendo loco. Ayer mientras caminábamos cerca del hospital junto al parque juró que la vi. Ella estaba con otra chica, me acerque corriendo, pero ella ingreso al hospital y no pude seguirla. Esto estaba mal, no se si es el amor o la culpa que me hace verla donde no está. -Dios hermano, en serio esa niña te dejo mal, no puedo creer que la hayas confundido con otra chica, debiste ver la velocidad que corriste tras ella -Ni me lo digas de por si me siento cada día más loco, fuera algo tan increíble que ella viva aquí, y que me la encuentre, pero te juro que esa chica era idéntica -Tranquilo, no tienes que justificarte conmigo, ¿Qué tal si echamos unas carreras hasta el hospital? -Vale – corrimos a toda velocidad, en verdad es relajante recorrer este camino, a pesar de estar dentro de una ciudad, la vegetación te hace sentir la libertad de la naturaleza, estaba tan concentrado en disfrutar del paisaje que no me di cuenta cuando choque con una persona, ella estaba agachada recogiendo algo, por eso no la vi, y me fui sobre ella. Ambos nos golpeamos, en verdad estaba atontado -Perdón, en verdad no te vi, estas bien? – abrí lo ojos aun desorientado, no puedo creer lo que mis ojos están viendo, quizás el golpe me estaba haciendo alucinar, esto era un sueño. Pero cuando oí su voz me di cuenta de que no estaba soñando, ni en mis mejores sueños sentiría su cercanía tan intensa como ahora -¿Josh?[Chapter 12] Capítulo 12 Han pasado más de 1 mes desde que volví. Es difícil adaptarse nuevamente al ritmo de estudio luego de 6 meses de dejar de estudiar. Tampoco es extremadamente duro, ya que solo estoy adelantando algunas materias. Mi familia y amigos están felices por mi regreso y yo igual. Mi vida vuelve a ser normal y un poco aburrida. Mi relación con Darío iba de maravilla si lo puedo decir así. Eramos amigos, pero tambien pareja, cada vez que nos necesitábamos, estábamos para el otro. Amo sus besos, me hacen sentir querida. Aunque debo admitir que ya no es como antes. Quizás un poco de rencor por lo que me hizo sufrir sigue dentro de mí, pero se supone que es el amor de mi vida, estoy segura de que se me pasará y todo volverá como antes. En cuanto a Josh no sé qué pensar, vi su entrevista, me gustó mucho lo que dijo, me pareció sincero, pero mi subconsciente me recordó que él era una farsa. El reportero le pregunto, ¿Qué buscaba de una chica?, a lo que él respondió: \"Oh, hombre, para mí todo es acerca de ser fiel a ti mismo y real, creo que si la chica trata de ser alguien que no es, o trata de hacerte pensar que es de otra manera...no vale la pena.\"- falso, él espera eso de otras persona y él no se muestra como es, todo un canalla –\"Prefiero estar con alguien que es ella misma y no tratando de ser alguien más\" Luego le preguntaron si tiene alguien especial: \"La verdad sí, hay alguien quien me quita el sueño, pero lastimosamente no es correspondido por situaciones del destino\" Le preguntaron si estaba hablando de la chica desconocida con la que le vieron hace un par de semanas \"Puede ser, lo único que quiero que se enteren es que la extraño\" – ahora todos tienen pena por él, un chico que no es correspondido, si supieran que él fue el que lo daño todo, pero qué diablos, tal vez ni se refiere a mí. Días después lo comprobé. Obvio que no hablaba de mí y yo haciéndome falsas ilusiones. Estaba teniendo la idea de llamarlo, pero la nueva información sobre él me quito la idea. Josh y Shannon han regresado. Josh Hutcherson regresa con su primera novia. Se los vio salir de una fiestas juntos, y desayunando al siguiente día. ¿Qué habrá pasado con la misteriosa chica con quien se le vio anteriormente? Hoy tengo clases por la mañana, la alarma suena varias veces pero no logró despertar. Solo 5 minutos más. Cuando abro lo ojos me levanto corriendo. Llegaré tarde y tengo turno en el hospital. Me cambio con lo primero que encuentro, salgo de mi casa sin desayunar. El camino a la universidad es corto. Caminando entre 20 – 30 minutos. Camino por el parque lineal hasta llegar al campus de la universidad, que esta unto al hospital. La mayoría de los días coincido con Santy o Fer, ellos perdieron en una materia, por eso yo estoy adelantando otras para el próximo semestre estar iguales. Miro el reloj, tengo 10 minutos para llegar. Para adelantar tiempo me coloco el mandil y la identificación para ingresar al hospital. Recojo mi cabello con un moño para que no me estorbe, en medio del ajetreo mi pendiente se enreda en mi cabello, cuando logro quitarlo cae al suelo. Me agacho a buscarlo, por fin lo encuentro cuando alguien se va encima de mí, ambos nos estampamos contra el piso. -Perdón, en verdad no te vi, estas bien? – dice él chico, no lo culpo quizás no vio cuando me agache, creo que el llevo la peor parte. Hay algo de esa voz que hace a mi cuerpo estremecerse. Lo miro fijamente y él a mí. No puede hacer, ¿qué hace aquí? -¿Josh?- lo miro fijamente, en verdad no me convenzco el tenerle en mi frente, pero aquí esta, otra vez en mi camino -¿Alex?- veo que el también duda en que si soy yo, me levanto rápidamente, tengo que irme, alejarme de él, no quiero que vuelva a interferir en mi vida. Me pongo de pie y avanzo sin mirar atrás -Nooo, espera, no te vayas- él corre detrás de mí -Tengo que irme – sigo caminando, ¿Por qué no me deja en paz? -Sigues furiosa?.. Aun me odias? -¿debería? -Sí, bueno no… por favor, podrías parar y escucharme? -No, no puedo, tengo que darme prisa o llegaré tarde -Promete que hablarás conmigo – me dice tomándome del brazo, siento nuevamente esa corriente extenderse por mi cuenta -¿Por qué? Mejor dicho ¿de qué quieres hablar? No recuerdo que tengamos algún tema que tratar – continuo avanzando - ¿Qué haces aquí Josh? -Quizás no me creas, pienses que soy un acosador, pero si hubiera sabido que vivías aquí en verdad te hubiera buscado, pero no me dejaste pista de tu paradero. El mundo es pequeño Alex, ¿Quién diría que de tantas ciudades en el mundo, vivas en la misma que mis abuelos? -Mmmm yo diría mala suerte…- veo el reloj, si continuo con este paso apresurado llegare a tiempo -Alex, no sabes cómo me siento – suspira- nunca pensé que te volvería a ver, nunca pensé que la vida te pusiera de nuevo en mi camino, estaba por darme por vencido, pero aquí estas, tan hermosa como siempre -Tus cumplidos no te servirán Hutcherson, ya no soy la misma niña tonta llena de ilusiones que conociste en Denver – llego a la entrada del hospital, él continua persiguiendo, pero aquí le perderé la pista ya que no puede entrar sin identificación -Alex, nunca quise hacerte daño, por favor solo pido que me escuches – sujeta mi brazo antes que pueda escabullirme por la entrada -Suéltame, Josh -No hasta que me escuches -No tengo porque hacerlo, suéltame o llegaré tarde, si no lo haces gritaré -Hazlo, pero no te soltaré hasta que me permitas hablar contigo... Puedes gritar, no me importa que me encierren, pero te advierto que si abres esa boca te callaré con un beso -Eres un idiota, no tengo tiempo, no puedo llegar tarde, déjame – trato de zafarme -¿Alex? – Connor llego agitado viéndome sorprendido -Hola Connor, es un gusto volverte a ver… ahora hazme un favor y dile a tu hermano que me suelte -Josh… -No te metas en esto Connor, esta niña es una cabezota y no le dejaré ir hasta que acepte escucharme – él no se iba a dar por vencido, me rindo -Está bien, hablaremos pero ahora no, tengo que irme- él afloja su agarre un poco -Dame tu numero celular – eso sonó a una orden, pero no me queda otra opción -Anota – le dicto mi número, y él lo ingresa en el suyo- contento, adiós…- antes de entrar me giro – pero tendrás que esperar unos días, mi cell está dañado y me lo entregan en unos días – antes que pueda decirme algo entro al hospital, paso mi tarjeta de registro y me meto en el baño. Me encierro en él y las lágrimas inevitablemente caen por mis mejillas. Por qué me tiene que pasar esto a mí? Por qué tiene que reaparecer en mi vida? Todo era perfecto, todo mi mundo era perfecto, pero él tiene que volver. No sé ni porque lloro. Yo no siento nada por él y sin embargo estoy aquí llorando. Tendré mucho que pensar esta noche. Me lavo el rostro y salgo. No quiero que nadie se dé cuenta de lo que me pasa. Entre tanto ajetreo de mi turno, mi mente se mantuvo ocupada. Cuando casi terminaba mi turno recibí un mns al cell. No mentí cuando dije que mi cell estaba dañado., es verdad, ahorita llevo el cell de Darío y el mensaje es de él. -Pequeña, espero que no tengas planes en la tarde porque pienso llevarte a comer conmigo antes de tus clases. -Claro pequeño, salgo en 15 minutos, nos vemos en el parque? - Ya estoy ahí, búscame en el estacionamiento, traje el carro de mi papá Me apresuro en terminar con esta historia clínica. Entro al baño y retoco mi maquillaje. Cuando salgo por la puerta, lo veo. Josh sigue ahí, con la misma ropa deportiva de esta mañana. No lo puedo creer, se quedó a esperarme, definitivamente está loco. Salgo rápidamente y me dirijo al estacionamiento, localizo el carro de Darío, pero veo que no está en él. -¿Cuándo crees que hablaras conmigo? -No lo sé – giro para enfrentarlo – te dije que algún momento, ¿Qué haces aquí? Deberías haberte ido, ya te di mi número -Necesito que me digas un día y una hora -Perdóname pequeña, fui a comprar una botella de agua – Darío llega a mi lado y besa mi frente, veo como Josh se tensa – Hola – mira a Josh, luego me mira a mí -Darío, él es Josh, Josh Hutcherson -¿Josh Hutcherson? ¿El actor? Lo abrazo, buscando protección – Sí, lo conocí en Denver y casualidad de la vida, sus abuelos viven aquí – le digo despreocupadamente, él le ofrece su mano y Josh lo acepta -Waooo, es un gusto conocerte, Alex nunca me hablo de ti -¿ah no? – Josh sonríe, como si eso le causará gracia- pues fuimos muy buenos amigos -Vamos pequeño, muero de hambre – lo jalo hacia el carro – Nos vemos Josh -Alex, queda pendiente nuestra conversación, adiós Darío, fue un gusto conocerte Entramos en él auto en completo silencio. Salimos del estacionamiento. -Bien ..-suelta Darío- ¿Por qué no me contaste que lo conociste? -Se me olvido, no es nadie importante – me encojo entre hombros -No me vengas con eso, a uno se le olvida un conocido, pero no creo que se te olvide que conoces un famoso de Hollywood, que te mira como si quisiera comerte – mierda, me está atacando, eso me llena de iras -No tengo nada que ver con él, además no entiendo tu actitud, nosotros no somos nada más que amigos, no tengo porque darte explicaciones – suelto, e inmediatamente me arrepiento -Alex, sabes que eso no es así, nuestra relación no es de \"amigos\" exactamente; pero veo que estas imposible – suspira – perdóname, no quiero pelear, tienes razón en el sentido que no tengo que reclamarte nada, pero en verdad me da celos – pasa su mano por su nuca – me siento inseguro, no puedo competir con alguien como él – estaciona el carro, giro para mirarlo -No tienes por qué competir con nadie, él no es nadie más que un amigo, mejor dicho un conocido – lo tomo del rostro y lo beso, él lo corresponde y sé que ya no está enojado, pero porque siento una punzada en mi corazón?, la imagen de Josh invade mi mente durante este beso..[Chapter 13] Capítulo 13 No lo puedo creer, en verdad es ella y la tengo frente a mí. Veo que sigue dolida, pero por lo menos tengo su número. Aunque tengo miedo de que sea falso, ella me advirtió que su cell estaba dañado,… que debo hacer?, la esperaré, algún día tendrá que salir. Después de que mi hermano se fuera, diciéndome que estoy loco y obsesionado, me senté en una banca del parque frente a la puerta del hospital por donde ella ingreso. Pasaron varias horas, pero fueron como segundos cuando la vi salir, ansiaba este momento; nuestras miradas se cruzaron y ella cambio de dirección, fue muy rápidamente hacia el parqueadero junto al parque, no lo podía permitir, no se iba a escapar. Corri tras de ella, cuando la alcancé le dije -¿Cuándo crees que hablaras conmigo? -No lo sé – me enfrentó – te dije que algún momento, ¿Qué haces aquí? Deberías haberte ido, ya te di mi número -Necesito que me digas un día y una hora – no iba a dejar que te escapes esta vez sin escucharme -Perdóname pequeña, fui a comprar una botella de agua un chico alto, ojos verdes, debo admitir que muy bien parecido nos interrumpió, se acercó a ella, la besó en la frente ¿Quién es? ¿Su novio? No no puede ser– Hola – me míra directamente -Darío, él es Josh, Josh Hutcherson – ella nos presenta -¿Josh Hutcherson? ¿El actor? – pregunta, por lo menos me conoce, quizás ella le habló de mí, espero que no le diga lo de la última noche, porque no estoy con ganas de que pateen mi trasero, yo no diera pelea porque me lo merezco Ella lo abraza y una punzada de celos me inunda – Sí, lo conocí en Denver y casualidad de la vida, sus abuelos viven aquí – es muy irónica, aunque es verdad, el mundo es chico -Waooo, es un gusto conocerte, Alex nunca me hablo de ti – sonrío satisfecho, ella no quiere que él sepa de mí, quizás porque si le importo, o le importó lo que teníamos -¿ah no? – espero que él note mi ella entendió mi mala intención y se lo lleva – Nos vemos Josh -Alex, queda pendiente nuestra conversación, adiós Darío, fue un gusto conocerte – me siento satisfecho, a pesar de que ella está enfadad pienso luchar. Me prometí a mí mismo y a la vida luchar por ella, y nada de lo que haga me lo impedirá. Llego a mi casa, quiero ir a mi cuarto. Necesito saber si él es su novio. Ella me dijo que era viciosa al internet, pero nunca veo que publique nada en twitter, bueno nunca veo nada de ella porque no puedo acceder a su información. Que frustración… -Más acosador y te juro que ella te pondrá una orden de alejamiento – Connor entra en mi cuarto con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja - ¿por lo menos sirvió de algo estar allí todo el día? -Sí, la vi – digo frustrado – pero ella tiene a alguien más, alguien que la abraza y la besa, alguien que no sabe de mí, de que fui su amigo aunque arruine todo -Tú también que quieres? Que ella grite a los cuatro vientos que fue acosada sexualmente por el famoso Josh Hutcherson, estás loco hermano – ríe con ironía -Necesito saber qué relación tienen, pero no sé cómo averiguarlo, no puedo ver su información en twitter – suspiro resignado -¿Buscaste en Facebook? Si ella no usa twitter puedes buscar en fb, crea uno falso si crees que no t aceptará, o te puedo prestar el mío -¿tienes fb?- le pregunto admirado, ya que mi hermano no es muy fan a la redes sociales como yo -Bueno cree alguno una vez, pero no lo uso, a veces lo abro… no creo que ella se rehusé a aceptarme, después de todo yo soy adorable y ella no me odia -GRACIAS POR RECORDARMELO- nótese mi sarcasmo – no necesito a nadie más para hacerme sentir mal, conmigo es suficiente hermano -Si tienes su correo, la encontraremos fácilmente Abrimos la página y la buscamos. Mi corazón dio un salto cuando ví su foto de perfil. Ella muy hermosa con un vestido azul mar cortó. Está con 2 bebes una en cada brazo, ellas vestidas de blanco. Quizás sean las hijas de su prima. Ella me contó sobre las mellizas, son como sus hijas. Puedo ver esa sonrisa que ilumina su rostro, estoy seguro que ella es para mí. La mujer perfecta para este hombre imperfecto. -¿no puedes ver más? – le pregunto a Connor -No, ella tiene perfil privado, pero ahora le envío una solicitud -No te va aceptar – le aseguro – ella no quiere que yo sepa nada de su vida -¿Ah no? – me pregunta divertido y señalando al computador – pues mira quien acepto inmediatamente – imposible, ella está conectada y lo acepto -Déjame ver – empujo a Connor a un lado, casi se cae de la silla -Tranquilo enamorado, mira lo que quieras, pero no invadas mi privacidad – dice queriendo sonar indignado y me deja solo en el cuarto Miro sus fotos, muchos álbumes de ella con sus amigos, ella con su familia. En todas muy feliz. Tiene fotos divertidas con sus amigos, en campamentos, piscinas, en el hospital. Veo las fotos etiquetadas: ella cosiendo la oreja a un señor en el hospital, veo en su mirada reflejada la pasión que la caracteriza cuando hace algo, me recuerda a ella bailando. Veo fotos de ella en fiestas, miro una foto tomada el 24 de febrero, el comentario dice \"Con nuestra amiga Alex …te extrañamos lokita, nos diste la mejor sorpresa apareciendo en la fiesta\" eso quiere decir que ella regreso 2 semanas después de nuestro incidente. Miro otras fotos de esa fiesta.. ella cantando con una chica, ¿canta?, eso no lo sabía, espero poder escucharla algún día… y por fin... una foto de ella con el tal Darío. Los dos están abrazados. Ella sentada en su regazo y con sus manos sujetas a las de él. Ambos sonrientes. No lo puedo creer, eso quiere decir que ellos ya andaban cuando ella estaba en EEUU, o ese día empezaron su relación. Ta rápido se olvidó de mí. Ella dijo que le gustaba. No sé qué pensar, leo los comentarios y se me hace más difícil respirar. Todos dicen cosas como: lindos tortolitos, por fin esta juntos, se les ve bien. Apago la pc, no quiero frustrarme más, no quiero pensar en que ella me mintió, y más que todo no quiero pensar en que ella no me quiere. -Josh, estoy pensando en llevarte con un psiquiatra, le diré que sufres un trastorno compulsivo-obsesivo -Hermano, no estas ayudando – le digo con frialdad. Él prende de nuevo la computadora. Escucho que teclea, pero no me interesa saber que está haciendo -Ves, dice Alex que si tanta es la urgencia, se pueden ver el jueves a las 6 de la tarde en la entrada de la universidad -¿qué?- me levanto de un salto, otra vez le empujo de la silla y Connor se cae al piso -Dios, Josh estás loco…. Ella te va a ver, no es necesario que me causes un traumatismo para llevarme al hospital como excusa Veo el mensaje: \"Dile a tu hermano que quiero terminar con esto de una vez, ando muy ocupada sustituyendo a una amiga en sus turnos y más los míos no tengo tiempo, pero dile que el jueves a las 6 de la tarde salgo y podemos hablar\". Mi corazón salta, la voy a ver, voy a hablar con ella, ella me hablará, estaremos solos. Dios, soy tan dichoso, como unas simples palabras me pueden hacer saltar de esta manera -¿Qué le escribiste? – le exijo a Connor -Solo le escribí \"Hola Alex\" y le dije que tú necesitas hablar con ella -Te amo Connor- le abrazo y le hago fosforito en su cabeza -Dios, cuando me veas actuando así de patético por una chica, promete que me golpearas hasta que entre en razón o me llevaras a un psicólogo No pude dormir, maldigo al tiempo por no pasar rápido. Me levanto temprano. Son las 5h30am, me baño y salgo a correr sin esperar a Connor, le deje una nota para que me encuentre en \"El Paraíso\". Llego ahí, toda la gente camina y hace ejercicio como todas las mañanas. Me siento bajo un árbol donde puedo ver directamente las puertas del hospital y el campus de la universidad. Luego de unos minutos la veo. Ella tan hermosa como siempre. Está con un chico y una chica, riendo muy agradablemente. Su sonrisa es la más hermosa que he visto, no puedo esperar para que este tan cerca de mí. Anoche lo decidí. No me importa si no la tengo. Quiero ser su amigo, su verdadero amigo y trataré de conquistarla. Pero ahora si tengo que andar paso a paso. Con paciencia, si la vida me ha dado una oportunidad no pienso dejar que se escapé de mis manos. Así se han convertido mis días, madrugo a correr y me detengo solo para verla. Paso el día pensando en que decirle, pero por más que preparo mi discurso siento que no es suficiente. Estoy listo para ir a buscarla, me he cambiado de ropa cuatro veces. Entre las burlas de Connor diciéndome que parezco chica emocionada, por fin estoy satisfecho con mi aspecto. ¿Quién lo diría?, Josh Hutcherson, famoso, adinerado, a quien nunca le han faltado mujeres para meterlas en su cama; esta todo emocionado por una chica sencilla que no se impresiona con nada de lo que puedo ofrecerle. Llegue y me senté en la banca en la que ella pueda verme. Espere, esperé, y nada. Son las 6h30pm. ¿se le habrá olvidado? ¿Estará jugando conmigo? Decido llamarla, solo espero que ya tenga su celular, que este sea su número correcto. Timbra y no contesta. Luego de 5 llamadas sigue sin contestar. Lo que me enfurece y frustra. Miro nuevamente el reloj 6h54, todo está oscuro, casi no hay personas. Quizás ella se está cobrando por lo que le hice, dejándome plantado. Empiezo a caminar frustrado. No sé por qué mientras más planeamos las cosas, más probablemente no se den. Tengo ganas de llorar, pero no lo haré, nunca lo he hecho y no pienso empezar ahora. Cruzo el puente, me detengo a mirar el río, bueno casi no lo veo pero lo escucho, en verdad esa niña me tiene en sus manos. No se cómo, ni cuándo pero paso. Agarro la rosa roja que le compre. Quiero lanzarla al agua, y que la corriente se la lleve, quisiera que la corriente se lleve mis sentimientos, cuando estoy a punto de lanzarla escucho su voz.. -Josh ¿qué estás haciendo? – rápidamente volteo, ocultando la rosa tras mi espalda -Alex… pensé - suspiro – que me dejaste plantado – no puedo ocultar mi tristeza -Perdóname, en verdad, no quise hacerte esperar, pero llego un paciente en shock, tuvimos que hacer RCP, solo te puedo decir que es una maniobra muy cansada y todos los que estamos alrededor tenemos que ayudar durante 20 minutos que es lo que nos exigen las guías de procedimiento – frunzo el ceño – y cuando la sacamos de paro, volvió a entrar, así que por eso no te pude contestar… en verdad no quise ser impuntual, pensé que ya te habías ido -Estaba por irme, pensé que no querías verme -Si te soy sincera, tampoco es que esté fascinada con esa idea – auch eso fue un golpe bajo - ¿Qué traes en tus manos? Saco la rosa y se la muestro – La vi de camino aquí y pensé en ti- ella me mira incrédula, así que bajo los ojos y miro la rosa – es hermosa, es perfecta, la más sencilla y perfecta flor, representa delicadeza y pureza igual que tú, pero también tiene espinas, no son malas, simplemente son una forma de defensa… para llegar a tener una rosa entre tus manos debes tener cuidado de no herirte, pero si lo consigues obtienes una maravillosa recompensa….- tomo una gran bocanada de aire – perdóname Alex, en verdad no sabes lo mal que me he sentido por todo, lo mal que la he pasado sabiendo que fui un estúpido, me atormenté por no volverte a ver, por perder una gran persona… ahora que la vida me da una nueva oportunidad quiero hacer todo lo que esté en mis manos para que no me odies y me aceptes de nuevo en tu vida Levanto la mirada y veo que ella está apoyada en la barandilla del puente viendo al cielo. Sus ojos están vidriosos, quiere llorar pero se resiste. Me acerco a ella y le toco su hombro, ella no se mueve así que la tomo de sus manos y la giro para que quede frente a mí. En cuanto nuestras miradas se cruzan sus lágrimas se empiezan a derramar, la tomo de sus hombros atrayéndola a mí. Siento sus sollozos en mi cuerpo, pero también siento el placer de tenerla otra vez aquí conmigo, donde pertenece, donde encaja perfectamente. Me parte el corazón verla llorar, yo debería suplicar por su perdón, ella no debería estar así…. -Shhh tranquila, por favor no llores – beso su coronilla – perdóname no quiero que te sientas mal preciosa, todo fue mi culpa, solo quiero que perdones…- la aparto un poco, tomo su mentón y la obligo a mirarme - ¿Por qué lloras? Yo debería ser el que derrame lágrimas de súplica por tu perdón.. -Josh, yo exageré todo, debí escucharte, debí darte la oportunidad de disculparte - ¿qué? Ella se está disculpando, porque se siente culpable, yo fui el tonto que arruino todo -No Alex, es normal que hayas reaccionado así, yo fui un abusivo, no debí propasarme, es normal que hayas reaccionado así, yo no puede contenerme, lo siento Alex, pero mi corazón y mi cuerpo saltaban y no me pude contener, quería tenerte para mí, perdóname, no quería obligarte a estar conmigo… -No lo entiendes Josh – me interrumpe aun llorando y aparta la mirada, -¿Qué es lo que no entiendo princesa?- tomo su mentón nuevamente obligándola a mirarme -Mierda Josh… yo también quería estar contigo, me entiendes,… - No, no lo entiendo – yo también quería besarte, quería arriesgarme a quererte, sentía que eras sincero, que sentías algo por mí.. -Alex, nunca te mentí, yo quería estar contigo, lo admito, pero no solo porque quisiera meterte en mi cama, sino porque en verdad siento cosas por ti, no encuentro la definición exactamente, pero no quiero perderte, por favor discúlpame - Es verdad lo que me dices? No querías solo usarme? -Tú crees que si fuera solo por eso yo estaría aquí rogándote -Puede ser por tu ego de hombre – me separo de ella, completamente frustrado -Alex, por favor, si fuera por mantener mi ego, no estuviera aquí pidiéndote la oportunidad de que me aceptes como amigo, en resumen… no estuviera matando mi \"ego masculino\" rogándote -Perdóname, por favor… - ¿Qué? Diablos porque se disculpa -No Alex, no tienes por qué pedir perdón en todo caso, yo soy el que debe hacerlo, pero no entiendo por qué haces esto de culparte de algo que no tienes la más mínima culpa... – me acerco y la abrazo, ella duda por un momento y luego se relaja y corresponde a mi abrazo- no sabes cuánto esperé este momento, cuanto te extrañe, casi me muero cuando te fuiste sin decirme a donde.. -Lo siento por eso, yo… -Shhh, por favor Alex, no quiero discutir, no quiero saber porque te sientes culpable, no quiero arruinar este momento – ella se relaja, no sé cuánto tiempo estuvimos así, pero no fue lo suficiente, ella mira su reloj -Diablos, ¿Cómo se fue le tiempo así?, tengo que irme -¿te acompaño? No acepto un NO por respuesta, es muy tarde y no quiero que te pase nada -Bueno, lo acepto, vamos – dice tomándome de la mano, a lo que yo aprovecho para enlazar mis dedos con los suyos. Caminamos en silencio por el parque lineal, a esta hora solo estamos nosotros… escucho los autos a lo lejos, escucho el río sonando y los grillos haciendo ruido. El silencio no es incómodo, todo lo contrario. Miro el cielo, es hermoso y estrellado, la luna está llena e ilumina nuestro camino. De reojo la veo y no puedo imaginarme lo hermosa que es y que la he recuperado. Ella tropieza con algo en el camino y yo la agarró entre mis brazos para evitar su caída. Y ahí estamos, en nuestro momento mágico, los 2 solos en el ambiente perfecto, muy cerca el uno del otro, veo sus labios provocadores cerca de mí…nuestros alientos mezclándose…[Chapter 14] Capítulo 14 -¿Así que somos amigos de nuevo? – no sé de donde saque voluntad para no dejarme llevar por mis instintos, yo entre sus brazos, y nuestras bocas muy cercas, pero no le puedo hacer esto a Darío, él es el hombre de mi vida, no puedo dañar algo que tanto he querido por una aventura. Josh me ayuda a poner de pie, veo la frustración en su rostro – Claro, si tú ya me perdonaste, es lo que más deseo en este momento, ser tu amigo, que nos volvamos a tener confianza -Todo olvidado Josh, te extrañe mucho amigo – paso mis brazos por su cuello y lo abrazo -¿Alex?, ¿puedo preguntarte algo? -Lo estás haciendo- le sonrío separándome de él – Claro! -Que chistosita, mmm – veo que duda en preguntarme - ¿Darío es tu novio? Mierda, no sé qué decirle, ni yo sé que somos con Darío, pero no puedo mentirle a mi amigo – La verdad es difícil de explicar, bueno es una larga historia, no sé si sea el momento propicio para contártela -¿no me tienes confianza? -No digas eso, claro que te tengo confianza, pero es un tema delicado, y no sé cómo lo tomes… la mayoría de las personas que saben me dicen que estoy cometiendo un error el estar con él, pero yo no estoy segura. No tenemos una relación de novios, pero lo intentamos ¿me entiendes? -Así que son amigos con derecho, no quiero recriminarte pero no pensé que aceptaras ese tipo de relaciones -Ni yo me imaginé una relación así, pero es lo mejor que pudimos hacer, de una forma u otra nos damos nuestro espacio, aunque yo no estoy con nadie más, ni él lo está... La idea era probarnos el uno al otro que hay confianza... -¿lo quieres?- me tomo por sorpresa ¿lo quiero? Claro que lo quiero, pero la verdad ya no sé a qué medida, antes estaba segura de amarlo ahora solo sé que lo quiero mucho -Claro que lo quiero – el rostro de Josh se nubla -No sé qué decirte, no quiero mentirte pero me duele saber eso – suspiro - quiero saber toda su historia, por favor, no quiero meterme en tu vida pero necesito saberlo – no lo entiendo, por qué quiere saberlo, pero no creo que haga daño contarle -Bueno, te lo resumo – tomo aire – Darío es el hermano de mi a mejor amigo, vive cerca de mi casa. Nos conocimos en el barrio, muchas veces salíamos todos mis amigos y hacíamos reuniones para divertirnos. Una vez antes de navidad nos reunimos en la casa de mi amiga, estábamos tomando y jugamos a la botella. El chiste era que la pareja debía encerrarse en una habitación por 10 minutos. Yo nunca me había fijado en él como más que un amigo, su carácter es muy raro, en verdad no teníamos ni una amistad, incluso me parecía caerle mal. Yo estaba enyesada mi pie por un accidente así que cuando nos tocó juntos, no hicimos otra cosa que conversar. Luego de varias veces que nos tocó juntos, nos conocimos mucho, la verdad nunca habíamos hablado de esa manera. No sé en qué momento, ni como pasó pero nos besamos. Fue algo muy lindo, nunca me había sentido así con un chico. Desde ese día todo fue extraño, cuando nos veíamos, él era indiferente, hasta a veces era grosero, pero cuando se presentaba el momento terminábamos en situaciones más comprometedoras, como besos y hasta más…. y yo sin darme cuenta de poco a poco me enamoré de él, yo sé que suena estúpido, estaba siendo masoquista y sabía que él no me quería. Él tenía novia, juraba amarla, me lo decía muchas veces cuando estábamos juntos, pero yo seguía queriéndolo, intentado algo con él, seguía esperanzada. Antes de irme para Denver tuvimos una mala situación, me sentía usada, quería olvidarlo y trate de hacerlo, la distancia y el tiempo entre nosotros estaban a mi favor. Pero él siempre estuvo presente, en todo momento. Cuando regrese, lo primero que hizo fue besarme, me dijo que me extrañaba y lamentaba haberme hecho sufrir. Entonces decidimos darnos la oportunidad de esta manera. -¿Siempre lo tuviste presente, incluso cuando estabas conmigo? – eso me cogió desprevenida, no sé qué responderle, la verdad es que cuando estaba con Josh, nunca pensé en Darío pero si lo digo él podría pensar en cosas que no son – Esta bien, no me lo digas, la verdad no sé si quiero saberlo; pero espero que estés feliz princesa, si tú eres feliz es suficiente para mí -¿Por qué haces esto Josh? – el me frunce el ceño sin entender mi pregunta - ¿Por qué me insinúas que sientes algo más por mí? ¿Por qué me haces pensar que estas celoso o desdichado porque yo esté con alguien? - Porque es así…Alex, no quiero que por esto me dejes de hablar o no quieras ser mi amiga, o peor aún me pierdas la confianza, pero necesito que sepas, me gustas, ya te lo dije, me gustas más de lo que me gustaría admitir, te quiero para mí, pero no para solo sexo, te quiero como mi novia, como la chica que me apoye en cada momento, que me llene de besos, que me diga que me quiere, pero sobretodo que sea mi amiga, que siempre esté a mi lado… pero conformo con que seas feliz, aunque no sea conmigo.. Sus palabras me sorprendieron, ¿él me quiere? Josh, un chico que lo tiene todo, que puede tener a la mujer que quiera, mujeres hermosas que le pueden ofrecer lo que yo no… -Sé lo que estás pensando y en verdad no entiendo porque no te das crédito, nunca te compares con otras personas, Alex, puedo estar rodeado de muchas chicas, y he estado con muchas, pero ninguna como tú, ninguna tan especial como tú… -Yo no tengo nada de especial, soy una chica normal -Princesa – toma mi mentón – no sé porque eres tan insegura de ti mismo, pero nunca me cansaré de decirte que eres maravillosa – besa mi mejilla – eres preciosa, por dentro y por fuera, no sabes la envidia que siento de Darío por poder tenerte, por como lo quieres, te juro que si te hace sufrir le hare pagar -¿en verdad me quieres? ¿A mí? -Eso no lo dudes, siempre estaré aquí para ti, nunca me daré por vencido – mi corazón quiere salir del pecho, me lleno de ilusiones aunque no debería, yo tengo al hombre de mi vida junto a mí, pero a Josh también lo necesito Él me abraza, y yo a él. No sé si es normal que me sienta tan segura con él. Pero no me importa, lo tengo a mi lado. Por alguna rara razón no quiero perderlo, lo quiero aquí conmigo. Llegamos a mi casa, demasiado rápido para mi gusto. -¿Así que está es tu casa? -Sip, ahora puedes visitarme cuando quieras -¿En serio?, pues te tomaré la palabra princesa, estaré aquí unas 5 semanas más y quiero pasarlas contigo, por favor -Y yo quiero pasarla contigo – es la verdad, no quiero pensar en cuando se tenga que ir, quiero disfrutarlo -¿Y a qué hora nos vemos mañana? – La verdad, no tengo muchas materias este ciclo, y ya termine mis turnos de esta semana, así que podre pasar mucho tiempo mientras estés aquí -¿Te gustaría se mi guía turística? Por favor, quiero conocer esta ciudad y otros lugares, pero mis abuelos no han tenido tiempo -Claro, me encantaría, el problema es que no tengo auto y para movernos fuera de la ciudad y a ciertos lugares será difícil, dentro de la ciudad podemos usar trasporte -Tranquila, mi abuelo me prestó un auto para movernos, pero no lo hemos usado porque no tengo idea de dónde ir, además mi licencia de conducir no sirve en este país -Listo, tranquilo, yo tengo licencia, yo tengo clases mañana solo hasta las 9 de la mañana ¿en dónde quieres que nos veamos? -Te espero en la salida del campus, en el parque, de ahí vamos a mi casa a recoger el carro y empezamos mi recorrido turístico -Listo – me abraza fuertemente, no sé cuánto tiempo, pero ya debía entrar antes de que mis papas se preocupen – Josh me tengo que ir -Perdóname, es que me encanta estar contigo, ahora ¿me ayudarías a conseguir un taxi? -Dame un minuto – llamo a un servicio de taxi y 5 minutos después llego - Nos vemos mañana princesa – besa mi mejilla y sube el taxi, veo como se marcha y me quedo con una sonrisa que nadie me la borrará[Chapter 15] Capítulo 15 Así han pasado las mejores 3 semanas de mi vida, junto a mi hermano y a mi princesa. He conocido tantos bellos lugares y compartido experiencias maravillosas. Cada día esta niña se mete más bajo mi piel, cada día me enamoro más, pero siempre hay hago que dañe los momentos. Cada vez que estamos juntos, él la llama y ella se va. No me puedo enojar con ella y tampoco con él. Ellos se quieren y aunque no me guste ella le pertenece. Pero como siempre digo, nunca me daré por vencido. Decidí crear una cuenta en Facebook para escribirle por las noches. Amo estar con ella, nunca me canso de saber sobre lo que piensa, ella nunca me aburre aunque no tengo cosas nuevas que contarme porque pasamos todo el día juntos. Aunque sé que se molesta, siempre pongo frases de amor para ella, como indirectas. Le dije que nunca me daría por vencido y gracias al cielo que ella no ha perdido su confianza en mí. No habla sobre mis declaraciones, sé que no quiere hacerme sentir mal. Pero cada vez se me hace más difícil ocultarlo. Ella me hace feliz y tengo que gritárselo al mundo. Así que empecé a twittear, y no falto mucho para que toda la prensa quisiera saber sobre la chica que tiene loco a Josh Hutcherson. No me gusta que la prensa se meta en mi vida, siempre inventan chismes y cosas así, pero necesito que todos sepan que estoy enamorado, aunque no saben de quien, ni siquiera conocen mi paradero estos momentos, pero muy pronto lo sabrán si todo sale como lo tengo planeado. Lo malo es que por error conecte mi Facebook a Twitter y ahora tengo 5000 mil solicitudes de amistad. Gracias a Connor logré que mi cuenta sea privada y que solo me envíen mensajes mis amigos y no me pueden enviar solicitudes, solo yo. Dios, esto de las redes sociales es un lío. Estoy sentado fuera del campus de Alex, ayer no la pude ver porque salió con ese tipo. La invite hoy a almorzar en mi casa. Ella ha sido mi guía turística, la recojo en la universidad, ella conduce llevándonos por toda la ciudad y de noche la dejo en su casa. Luego conversamos en videoconferencia hasta horas muy avanzadas de la noche. En verdad actuó como un adolescente enamorado. -Hola Pequeño – ella me saca de mis pensamientos, se acerca a saludarme con un beso en la mejilla, cuando se agacha pierde el equilibrio y cae y la atrapo en mis brazos -Hola princesa, adoro saludarte así – ella sonríe -No te burles de mi torpeza -¿O qué? – le digo con picardía, ella aun entre mis brazos -O te haré pagar Hutcherson -Eso quiero verlo -Me estás retando Hutcherson, no me gusta perder y nunca dejo de un lado un reto – eso es perfecto -A mí tampoco me gusta perder, ya veremos cual de los 2 puede con el otro -Ya lo veremos – me pierdo en sus ojos, quiero besarla, me acerco lentamente sin perder el contacto visual – Ahora me ayudarías a ponerme de pie – porque hace eso, siempre acaba con estos bellos momentos, la dejo ir – gracias pequeño - Ahora vamos, quiero que conozcas a mis abuelos, ellos llegan solo a almorzar y por la noches -¿Estas seguro de esto? No creo que a tus abuelos les agrade mucho mi visita -Tonterias- me acercó y la tomo del rostro con ambas manos – Te van a adorar, como yo y Connor lo hacemos -Diablos, asi no puedo negarme -No quiero que lo hagas, vamos – la tomo de la mano y a llevo hacia la casa, queda muy cerca de la universidad, por eso corremos en la mañana por este trayecto ya que está cerca Cuando llegamos escuchamos voces en la cocina, tomo su cahqueta y su bolso y lo colocamos en el perchero. -Vamos – la tomo de la mano, ella está temblando, en verdad esta nerviosa – Alex, te amaran – como yo – no seas tímida -Recuerda que esto fue idea tuya no mía- le guiño el ojo y la llevo hacia la cocina, donde estan mis abuelos y Connor, que al vernos entrar sonrien -Josh te estabamos esperando – mi abuela me besa y luego se dirige a ella – Tu debes ser Alex, que linda niña – la toma de la mano y le hace dar una vuelta – déjame verte niña, ya quería conocer a la muchacha que trae loco a mi Josh - Mucho gusto en conocerla Señora Hutcherson – acerco a tomar un vaso de jugo -Nada de señora Hutcherson niña, dime abuela, ya casi somos de la familia, porque no creo que mi Josh te deje ir – literalemente escupí mi jugo y me salió por la nariz – Tranquilo hijo, yo se que no la dejaras ir – siento como mis mejillas se ponen rojas de la vergüenza como las de Alex, y miro de reojo a Connor y a mi abuelo que estan reprimiendo las risas -Abuela, no la asustes tanto, suficiente tiene con el acoso de Josh – dice Connor riendo y yo lo fulminó con una mirada -Mucho gusto Alex – dice mi abuelo abrazandola – perdona a mi esposa, a veces disfruta molestar con comentarios vergonzosos -No se preocupe señor, en verdad es muy graciosa, nunca había visto a alguien que expulse jugo por la nariz a tan larga distancia – dice ella mirandome y todos reímos ante nuestro comentario -Vamos a almorzar, la comida esta lista – dice mi abuela. Vamos al comedor y aparto la silla para que Alex pueda sentarse, claro junto a mí -Gracias Josh -Para servirte princesa – le susurro al oído y veo como se sonroja. Mi abuela sirve la comida y empezamos a comer -Esta delicioso señora Hutcherson -Ya te dije que me digas abuela, pequeña, con confianza – miro como ella se siente incómoda, mis abuelos tal ves piensan que es mi novia, pero aunque me duele admitirlo no lo és y no puedo comprometerla de esta manera -Abuela, no creo que eso sea lo correcto -¿Por qué no hijo?, ella es muy linda, y veo que la quieres mucho, si ella te hace feliz para mi es suficiente para considerarla como otra nieta -Abuela, no somos novios, solo grandes amigos – miro de reojo como ella se sonroja -Oh perdon no quise ser imprudente -No se preocupe señora – Alex contesta y mi abuela la interrumpe -Tranquila querida, pero de todas formas puedes decirme abuela, cuando anden juntos ya estarás acostumbrada- mi abuela es imposible -Ya mujer, no atormentes a los niños, dejalos en paz, ellos sabes como son sus relaciones – estoy empezando a pensar que esto no era una buena idea despues de todo Terminamos la cena y mis abuelos fueron a sus respectivos trabajos. Se despidieron de Alex, muy amistosamente. Estoy segura que la adoraron, ella es una ser muy facil de querer. La invitaron a venir cuando quiera. -¿Quieres conocer mi habitación?- ella asiente y la llevo -Es muy bonita – la dejo y me acerco a mí aparador donde saco mi cámara de fotos, mientras ella mira por la ventana le tomo una foto -¿que estas haciendo? -Pues quiero tener muchas fotos contigo, por cierto, tengo todas la fotos que nos tomamos en Denver, cuando quieras te las paso, eso si quieres tenerlas -Ya habrá tiempo para eso, pero déjame verlas – prendo el computador y se las muestro – vaya estamos muy bien, tu luces bien -Y tu tambien hermosa, pero quiero muchas mas, quiero hacer un album con todos nuestros momentos- ella se sonroja nuevamente -Déjame ver si tengo una USB en mi cartera- ella se levanta y busca en su bolso, vi como llevaba el libro que le regale – No he traído, otro día me las tienes que pasar -Claro, pero sabes hay una cosa que quiero hacer -¿qué cosa? -Quiero actuar otra vez la escena de la playa contigo -¿En serio?... Dale – dice sentandose en mi cama, yo me siento junto a ella - Así que de nuevo soy Katniss y tu Peeta -Dale – ella apoya su cabeza en mi hombro - ACCIÓN Respiro y empiezo - Katniss, no tiene sentido fingir que no sabemos lo que el otro está intentando, no sé qué clase de trato crees haber hecho con Haymitch, pero deberías saber que a mí también me hizo promesas, así que creo que podemos asumir que le mintió a uno de los dos Ella me mira y me pierdo completamente, en verdad quisiera que nuestro amor sea como el de Katniss y Peeta que a pesar de todo sobrevivió, pero prácticamente soy Peeta, queriéndola desde lejos por que ella tiene a alguien más que la cuida -¿Por qué dices esto ahora? - Porque no quiero que olvides lo diferentes que son nuestras circunstancias. Si tú mueres, y yo vivo, no me queda ninguna vida de regreso en el Distrito Doce. Tú eres toda mi vida – tomo aire y continúo - Nunca volvería a ser feliz… Es diferente para ti. No digo que no fuera a ser duro. Pero hay otra gente que haría que tu vida mereciera ser vivida – como no tengo un guardapelo que darle nuevamente, continúo -Tu familia te necesita, Katniss…. Nadie me necesita de verdad a mí -– Yo si – mi corazón por una extraña razón salta en mi pecho - Yo te necesito – no perderé esta oportunidad, ella duda si besarme, puedo imaginar en la situación que se encuentra; así que me acerco, tomo su mejilla, siento como nuestros alientos se mezclan, siento como su cuerpo se tensa y cierra los ojos -¿Qué tal si jugamos twister? – maldita sea, voy a matar a mi hermano – Lo siento, ¿interrumpí algo? – lo fulmino con la mirada y sabe que está en problemas -No para nada – ella se levanta rápidamente -¿en dónde quieres perder Connor? -Nada de eso, tú vas a perder, vamos a la sala – ellos salen y me dejan aquí sentado, frustrado, ¿acaso nunca podré besarla? ¿Por qué a mí? - Josh, apúrate eres el primero – dice Alex cuando entro en la sala, no digo nada, simplemente giro el reloj y cae PIE DERECHO ROJO -Mi turno – dice ella y queda parada frente a mí – Hola – dice sonriendo -Hola – le contesto, y con esa simple palabra siento como mi frustración se desvanece. Luego de un rato de juego, Connor fue el primero en perder, eso gracias a nuestra alianza con Alex -Eso es injusto, ustedes me empujaron -Deja de quejarte, aprende a perder, y disfruta ver como pierde este muchacho – dice ella -Ni creas que te será fácil, Alexandra – luego de varios giros, me encontré en la posición más rara de la vida, ella estaba recostada con sus brazos abiertos y sus piernas estiradas completamente. Yo estaba sobre ella bocaabajo, mis manos apoyadas a cada lado de su cabeza, mis pies a cada lado de sus piernas, prácticamente estaba todo sobre ella – Vaya la vista es genial – digo y ella nuevamente se sonroja, quisiera saber que piensa -Pues no te durará mucho esa sonrisa porque vas a perder Hutcherson -Ya regreso del baño, no se muevan – dice Connor -Me estas retando Alex, y yo enfrento todos mis retos – le digo con picardía guiñándole el ojo - Espero que no llores cuando pierdas querida, porque soy muy cruel en exigir mis premios por ganar -¿Ah sí? ¿Qué quisieras ganar? En el caso que tuvieras la mínima oportunidad de ganarme – dice muy seductoramente, así que no espero un segundo más y ataco sus labios Sentí sus labios bajo los míos, contrólate Josh, no querrás asustarla con uno de esos besos desesperados… nuestros labios se rozaban ligeramente, lentamente lleve una de mis manos a su pelo, deslizando los dedos entre su cabello y ella empieza responder, me besa, suave, dulcemente, mi lengua se lanzó a un encuentro con su labio inferior incitándola a abrir la boca, me quede allí unos segundos hasta que ladeo un poco la cabeza y me recibió con su lengua indecisa para fundirse en una danza parsimoniosa y erótica, trate de descubrir todos los recónditos de su boca, acariciando con sutileza el labio superior con la punta de mi lengua. Deslicé mis brazos, como pude, para entrelazarlos en su cintura. Se puso un tanto rígida al momento anonadada por mi actuación, pero después se calmó. Aun estábamos acostados en el piso, yo sobre ella, sosteniéndome sobre con mi brazo apoyado en el suelo para no caer sobre su cuerpo. Comencé a morder suavemente su labio y a repartir pequeños besitos en la comisura de sus labios. Ella abrió los ojos y se sonrojo. Se puso de pie de un solo brinco y yo hice lo mismo, agachó la mirada, se sentía avergonzada quizás. La atraje hacia mi cuerpo y se relajó en mis brazos, con las pocas fuerzas que me quedaban la estreche más contra mí, inhale el perfume que salía de su cabello, y ella empezó a sollozar. Vi como Connor entraba en la habitación, y cuando nos vio entendió que debía dejarnos solos. -Tranquila preciosa – ella escondida su rostro en mi pecho – soy un imbécil, no debí hacerlo, perdóname - ¿Por qué tiene que pasar esto? Porque tengo que siempre arruinar todo -¿Por qué lo dices? No has arruinado nada princesa, en todo caso yo hice todo -No Josh, yo soy la culpable, jamás debí dejar que sucediera esto – toma aire – arruine nuestra amistad y arruine mi relación con Darío, ¿no lo entiendes? – eso fue un golpe bajo, ella lo quiere y yo estoy aquí comprometiéndola -Lo siento, no quise meterte en este lío, pero en verdad no aguantaba más, te quiero Alex, nunca me he cansado ni me cansaré de decírtelo, perdóname, te prometo que no sucederá de nuevo pero no quiero que te eches la culpa -No lo entiendes Josh, yo también lo quise, yo también necesitaba ese beso – una sonrisa emanaba desde mi corazón -Alex, ¿Qué sientes por mí? – La tomo de sus hombros –Por favor necesito saberlo -Josh, en verdad no sé qué pensar, ese beso cambio todo lo que mi cerebro pensaba – suspira – te mentí – suelta frustrada – cuando estaba contigo, mejor dicho cuando estoy contigo se me olvida que lo tengo a él, se me olvida el mundo entero, se me olvida quien soy y quien eres tú, y que tan imposible eres para alguien como yo -Princesa, por favor, no digas eso… yo soy el que no te merece… me muero por escuchar que también me quieres por favor dímelo, si es lo que sientes por favor, necesito saber que te importo como tú a mi -Josh, te quiero, no sé a qué grado pero no estoy segura si pueda seguir siendo solo tu amiga, ese beso me lo demostró -Nada nos impide estar juntos – la estrecho de nuevo entre mis brazos, ella deja de llorar y relaja, no sé cuánto tiempo estuvimos así, pero siempre es muy corto, miro como se oscurece todo a nuestro alrededor, señal de que esta anocheciendo Ella rompe el silencio - Te seré sincera, porque como tú dices si no lo hago ahora no lo hare nunca así que escúchame bien y no me interrumpas- asentí y me senté en el sofá, ella comenzó a caminar de derecha a izquierda, organizando sus ideas para comenzar a hablar -Aunque al comienzo no quise darme cuenta no sé porque razón, en realidad me atraes, me parece que eres… eres- se sonrojo yo solo le sonreí esta actitud me parecía adorable- sumamente atractivo ¡y quita esa sonrisa de tu rostro Hutcherson!, pero me pareciste arrogante, nuestra forma de presentación no fue exactamente la ideal. Te ganaste mi corazón de poco a poco, pero esa noche mientras besabas mi cuello me sentí insegura, sentí que otra vez mas solo me querían para tener sexo. Por eso actué así, eso me rompió el corazón. Volví lo más pronto aquí, para tratar de sacarte de mi mente, y él estuvo ahí para mí… \"El amor de mi vida\", según yo. Ahora mismo no sé qué siento por él, pero si lo que siento por ti... – suelta el aire – te quiero, pero no quiero sufrir -Nunca lo volvería a hacer, solo quiero una oportunidad – ella se sienta a mi lado -Pero está de más decirte que tu estas con Shannon y yo con Darío, y aunque quisiera repetir lo de hace unos minutos, no puedo hacerle esto, no creo poder verlo con los ojos con los que te observo a ti, aunque antes estaba segura de amarlo, así que te pido que si es verdad lo que me dijiste hace unos segundos, me des un tiempo, un tiempo para hablar con él, para aclarar mi mente, estar sola, y si en verdad podemos estar juntos, obviamente tú debes terminar con quien sea que estés -Yo no estoy con nadie Alex, Shannon simplemente es mi conocida, mi exnovia. Desde que te conocí he soñado estar contigo. Y si es verdad que te quiero eso no lo dudes – rozo mis labios con los suyos – no sabes cuan feliz me hace que me des una oportunidad, prometo que entregare mi vida a enamorarte, preferiría morir a dejarte ir -Espero que sea cierto, porque no soportaría volver a sufrir por nadie, te estoy entregando mi corazón Josh -Y tú eres dueña de mi vida, me tienes en tus manos – nos juntamos en un casto beso, uno que no quiero que termine nunca, quizás el mejor de mi vida, el más dulce y perfecto, con las persona más perfecta – Nunca me dejes por favor, porque no quiero sufrir por amor La lleve a su casa, pero no me atreví a besarla, necesito que ella sea la que me bese, necesito saber que me quiere. Quedamos en que seguiríamos viéndonos pero yo no intentaría nada. Ella necesita aclarar lo que siente, y si me elige necesita arreglar las cosas con Darío. Prometí ser paciente pero me lleno de inseguridad y celos al saber que tal vez ella lo elija a él sobre mí. Este ha sido uno de los mejores días de mi vida. No puedo dormir por el recuerdo de aquel beso, no puedo dejar de pensar en ella. En que la quiero conmigo por siempre, no me interesa si tengo que dejar otras cosas, solo quiero ser de ella.[Chapter 16] Capítulo 16 Es extraño como un beso puede sacar a flote tus verdaderos sentimientos, la verdad la confusión me invade. Siempre quise tener un amor verdadero, un amor tan grande que me haga feliz. ¿Pero es Josh el indicado? ¿Puede en verdad alguien como él quererme? Es difícil tenerme ese tipo de confianza, alguien como él enamorado de alguien como yo. Creo que ese no es el verdadero problema, la cosa es que quiero a Darío, él se supone que es el amor de vida, y aquí estoy yo haciéndome falsas ilusiones con una estrella de cine que dice quererme. Maldita sea, ¿porque no puedo darme esa oportunidad?, ¿Por qué no puedo permitirme soñar? ¿tan mal quede luego de lo de Darío? Debo admitir que fue duro, y es verdad, soy insegura de mí mismo. No es fácil que te recuperes luego de que alguien te quiera solo por sexo. Es horrible sentirte usada, sentirte como un objeto y nada más. No me siento bonita, no me siento deseable, me siento insegura de misma, pero que diablo, me arriesgaré. Quiero a Josh, quiero darme la oportunidad de vivir en un cuento de hadas, quiero soñar, y si me equivoco y se me hace daño estoy segura de que saldré adelante. Nunca me dejado vencer por nadie y nunca dejaré que pase. Primero debo hablar con Darío, para mi buena o mala suerte no lo he visto toda la semana, pero debo encontrar el momento exacto para decirle que se acabó. No se cómo lo tomar, ni yo sé en lo que me estoy metiendo, es peor que lo que voy a hacer sea lo correcto. -Alex! Eres de lo peor ¿Dónde te has metido en estos días? No te he visto en la universidad, ni siquiera Fer te ha visto Mi mejor amigo, Santiago, quiero contarle todo, pero por primera vez no puedo contárselo. Él está muy feliz porque su hermano y yo andemos, no sé cómo lo tomará. - Lo siento Santy, he andado de un lado a otro, pero prometo ponerme al día, ¿Qué te parece si hoy me caen en mi casa para ver una peli? Mis papis y mi ñaño se fueron de la ciudad a arreglar unas cosas - Claro, genial, yo le aviso a Fer… creo que mi ñaño no podrá ir, anda muy lleno en la universidad y hoy fue a hacer un trabajo en casa de un compañero Genial, si Darío no viene puedo invitar a Josh, quiero que mis mejores amigos lo conozcan. Quiero dejar de mentir, de ocultarlo. - Bien, yo preparo todo, trae tú la película.. quiero que conozcan a alguien..! - ¿Alguien? Bueno, ahí nos vemos, a las 8 estaremos en tu casa, prepáralo todo, y consigue cobijas, la peli será de terror ;) Marco a su cell y a la tercera llamada me contesta -Acaba de llamar al chico más feliz de este universo, al chico más ilusionado y enamorado de la chica más hermosa de la vida -Creo que un simple HOLA sería suficiente -No, no sería suficiente, quiero gritarle al mundo lo que siento por ti, y más que todo quiero que tú lo sepas cada segundo de tu vida – su comentario me hace sonreír -Cursi – le digo con tono serio -Eres muy mala mi princesa -Lo soy, pero no te llame para escuchar tus comentarios -¿Ah no? Pensé que disfrutabas escucharme – dice indignado -Lo hago, pero no era para eso que te llame -¿Entonces, a que debo el honor de su llamada señorita? -Quería invitarte a Connor y a ti a ver una película en mi casa, vendrán unos amigos que quisiera que conozcas, bueno si tú quieres, si crees que no tendrás problema con eso -Me encantaría ir y sabes que no me importa que todos se enteren que te quiero, lo hago solo porque tú me lo pediste, si por mi fuera lo gritaría al mundo – es verdad, le dije que no se lo diga a nadie, y si en verdad tomaba la decisión de estar con él, no quiero que todos se enteren, quiero tener mi privacidad, no quiero verme involucrada en su vida de famoso -Bueno eso es un tema aparte, te espero a las 8pm en mi casa, se puntual pequeño -Si por mí fuera, estuviera contigo este momento – ruedo los ojos, no sabe que su comentario estos momentos me hace sentir incómoda, aún no he decidido que hacer, bueno ya lo he hecho pero él aun no lo sabe y hasta que no arregle las cosas con Darío, no se lo diré -Adiós Josh -Te quiero – corta la llamada y siento como mi corazón baila dentro de mi caja torácica Un poco antes de las 8pm Fer llego -¿Me podrías decir donde te has metido todos esto días? -Te lo contaré luego, créeme que tengo una muy buena excusa -Más te vale Alexandra – el timbre sonó -Yo voy – abró la puerta para encontrarme con Santiago -Ya llego por quien llorabas… chiquita – río con su saludo, siempre tiene que sacarme risas -¿Por qué nadie puede decirme un simple HOLA ALEX? -Jajaja más vale que tengas muchas palomitas, porque traje 2 películas y muero de hambre- el entra a la casa y cuando estoy cerrando la puerta escucho su voz -SI quieres golpearme en la nariz preferiría tu puño a la puerta -Hola Josh – me acerco para saludarlo con un beso en la mejilla, pero él me jala y me abraza -Hola preciosa – dice muy cerca de mi rostro -Váyanse a un hotel, ustedes siempre perturban mi inocencia – cierra la puerta de su auto y llega a nosotros – Hola Alex, gracias por invitarnos -Adelante chicos – les invito a pasar dentro, me dirijo adentro cuando Josh me jala del brazo y me da un beso en la comisura de los labios, luego me suelta. Dios, quiere torturarme este chico -Fer, Santy quiero presentarles a una personas - ellos salen de la cocina y nos miran, se quedan un momento mirándonos y veo como Fer lo reconoce -Dios –grita – eres Josh Hutcherson, no lo puedo creer -Josh, Connor ella es Fernanda y él Santiago -No lo puedo creer, no lo puedo creer – Fer grita como loca, después de todo Josh también es su ídolo – Alexandra te voy a matar, esto es un sueño -Mucho gusto conocerte Fernanda – le ofrece su mano y ella temblorosa lo saluda, también saluda a Santiago y Connor hace lo mismo -¿pero qué haces aquí en nuestro humilde país? ¿Cómo se conocen? ¿Hablas español? -Bueno vine a visitar a mis abuelos, nos conocimos en Denver y sí hablo español, estoy aprendiendo desde algún tiempo y desde que conocí a Alex he practicado mucho, lo tengo casi perfeccionado -Dios, Alexandra te voy a matar, ¿no se supone que soy tu mejor amiga? ¿Por qué no me lo dijiste? -Te lo contaré otro rato, ahora vamos a ver la película Ponemos la película y nos acomodamos en los sillones de la sala. Josh se sienta junto a mí, y veo como Santiago me mira con perspicacia, quizás ha notado nuestra conexión. Mientras vemos la película Josh se acurruca a mi lado, coloca su cabeza en mi hombro. Por suerte Santiago está muy concentrado en su comida y en la cinta que no lo nota. Estamos envueltos en cobijas y Josh entrelaza nuestros dedos debajo de las mantas que nos cubren. Cuando suena el timbre y me levanto a ver quién es. -¿Esperabas a alguien más? – me pregunta Santiago, niego con la cabeza y voy hacia la puerta, salgo al jardín y abro la puerta exterior. Juro que en este momento mi corazón se detuvo - Hola mi vida – Darío entra y me besa, como no respondo a su beso el me pregunta - ¿No me esperabas verdad? -¿Qué haces aquí? No es que no quiera verte pero Santy me dijo que no podías venir -Llegue a mi casa mi mama dijo que Santy estaba aquí, así que decidí venir, además me moría de ganas de verte entre la universidad y lo que tu andes haciendo no hemos podido estar mucho tiempo juntos – dice acariciando mi mejilla - Hola – mierda Josh – Perdón ¿interrumpí algo? – Darío lo mira y luego a mí -Hola Josh, un gusto volverte a ver – dice dudoso – Vamos adentro mi vida – me toma de la mano y cierra la puerta tras de mí. Entra y saluda a todos. Se sienta donde antes estaba yo y me jala haciéndome sentar en sus piernas y abrazando mi cintura. En otras ocasiones esto hubiera sido normal, pero ahora me siento muy incómoda. Veo a Josh de reojo, noto como se sienta tenso, y no sé cómo hacer para deshacer esta situación. Luego de un rato Darío me susurra -¿Por qué no vamos a tu cuarto? Necesito decirte algo – quizás fue un susurro pero estoy segura de que Josh lo escuchó porque su rostro se pone rígido. No sé qué hacer, ni cómo solucionar esto. No creo que sea el momento adecuado para hablar con Darío, pero tengo que hacerlo pronto. -Ahora no, quiero ver la película, luego me lo dirás ¿si? – le hago un pucherito y el besa mi frente Gracias al cielo la película se termina y Santiago está listo para poner otra. Yo me levanto y voy hacia la cocina a preparar más palomitas, veo como Darío conversa con Santiago y Connor sobre futbol, eso lo entretendrá No sé qué voy hacer, no me siento con la suficiente fuerza y aun tengo miedo de equivocarme. -Así que aún no has hablado con él – Josh entra en la cocina y me mira con sus ojos llenos de tristeza -No he podido, casi no lo he visto y no creo que este sea el momento correcto -Tranquila, no te estoy exigiendo nada, pero no tienes idea del dolor que siento de verte con él -No sé qué hacer Josh, tengo miedo de dañarlo, de dañar a otras personas, de equivocarme -Por favor no lo digas, no quiero saber que dudas de mí, quiero que estés segura de los que quieres hacer, quiero que seas feliz – dice acariciando mi mejilla, cuando Darío entra en la cocina, nos ve a ambos y creo que sospecha algo -Mi amor, dice mi hermano que quiere extramantequilla – dice llegando a mí, Josh se hace a un lado y empieza a servir soda en los vasos -Ya casi están Darío, solo 30 segundos más – no me deja termina la frase porque ataca mis labios, sus beso es desesperado, toma mis manos y las levanta depositándolas detrás de su cuello. Mi cuerpo está en alerta, solo me doy cuenta que Josh salió de la cocina. Mierda debe estar pensando lo peor de mí. -Te he extrañado mucho estos días – me dice Darío al terminar el beso, yo solo me limito a sonreír y pongo las palomitas en una bandeja para llevarla a la sala, él me toma del brazo y me gira para que frente de él - ¿Qué pasa? -Nada, solo me sorprendió la furia de tu beso – me mira anonadado -¿No te gusto? -No es eso, solo me sorprendió, y tampoco me gusto que me beses frente a otra persona -¿Otra persona? ¿o él específicamente? -Diablos Darío, ese besó parecía que me querías marcar como propiedad - Perdóname ¿sí? – dice abrazándome por atrás de la cintura – es que él te mira con deseo, y necesitaba mostrarle que eres mí, que te quiero como tú a mí Mierda, ahora no sé qué voy a hacer, tengo que decírselo, lo haré cuando todos se vayan. Cuando regresamos a la sala veo que Josh y Connor se están despidiendo de Fernanda y Santiago -¿Ya se van? -Sí, no queremos preocupar a la abuela – dice Connor, pero sé que simplemente es una excusa -Muchas gracias por todo Alex, un gusto conocerlos chicos – dice Josh y puedo percibir su voz llena de amargura -Los acompaño afuera – me deshago del agarre de Darío, espero que haya entendido mi mensaje de QUÉDATE AQUÍ. Les acompaño hasta la calle y Connor se despide de mí con un beso en la mejilla y entra en el auto -No debiste ver eso – le digo a Josh quien sostiene la mirada al piso- perdóname -No tengo nada de que perdonarte, después de todo eres su chica, aquí soy yo el intruso -No digas eso Josh, no es así, solo no he podido aclarar.. -Lo que sientes – me interrumpe -No, eso estoy segura, sé lo que debo hacer… no he podido aclararle las cosas a él, pero te prometo que lo haré.. -Por favor no hagas promesas que no vayas a cumplir, no quiero obligarte a hacer algo que no quieres -Basta Josh, me enoja que pienses que no quiero hacer lo correcto, estas dudando de mí, de lo que soy, de lo que siento por ti Alza su mirada, sus ojos están vidriosos, no por favor, que no se le ocurra llorar porque ahí si me sentiré una persona miserable – Perdóname, pero no sabes el daño que me hizo ver ese beso... Adiós – se sube al auto rápidamente y arranca dejándome sola y vacía Entro a mi casa y me siento junto a Darío a ver la siguiente película, por suerte él no me pregunta nada y se recuesta sobre mis piernas. Cuando se terminó todos se levantan listos para irse. -Darío ¿puedo hablar contigo? – el me mira interrogante -Bueno yo voy a acompañar a Fer a su casa y me adelanto, nos vemos allá hermano. Gracias Alex por todo, ya no te desaparezcas tanto – me dice Santiago dándome un beso en la mejilla -Mañana nos vemos, tenemos una conversación pendiente – me dice Fernanda con tono acusatorio. Salen por la puerta y nos dejan solos. No sé cómo empezar hasta que él rompe el silencio -Bien – suspira – nunca pensé que me dejarías -¿Qué? – pensé que me perdonaste por lo que te hice, que aún me amabas pero ya veo que no…. Veo que conseguiste a alguien que al parecer te quiere mucho y tú también a él -¿de qué hablas Darío? -¿Piensas que soy tonto? – Pone sus manos detrás de su cabeza - ¿Piensas que no me doy cuenta de lo que pasa? De eso quieres hablar, quieres terminar nuestra relación para irte con esa estrellita de Hollywood. Desde el día que lo conocí supe que algo pasaba entre ustedes, no quise comportarme como un novio celoso, pero lo de hoy lo demostró todo. No querías besarme, y él más obvio no pudo ser. Sé que has estado con él todos estos días, te han visto, me han dicho que te vieron con un chico y sé que es él, no me minetas por favor -Darío yo…. No sé qué decirte, simplemente sucedió, perdóname –digo mirando al piso -No tengo nada de que perdonarte, en realidad fui yo quien te perdí, es normal que estés confundida, pero te doy el camino libre, cuando veas que lo de ustedes no funcionará, estaré aquí esperándote - ¿Qué? miro sus ojos – es mejor que aprendas pro ti mismo, ese tipo de personas a quien les rodea la fama y el dinero no tienen pena de hacer daño, pero lo mejor es que lo vivas tú mismo porque aunque te lo diga no entenderás -Josh nunca jugaría conmigo – le digo más para mí que para él -No estoy tan seguro de eso, pero recuerda que siempre estaré para ti, estaré allí cuando necesites que tu corazón sea reconstruido, no me importa lo que suceda entre ustedes, siempre serás la persona que más quiera, solo tienes que darte cuenta que yo soy la persona que necesitas En verdad no sé qué decir, lo estoy haciendo sufrir, y él me ofrece su hombro para cuando Josh me haga daño. No quiero que suceda, no quiero que Josh me hiera, pero no puedo evitar pensar que existe ese riesgo. Y Darío estará allí para amarme incondicionalmente -Te quiero Alex, eres el amor de mi vida, pero yo mismo me gané esto – me besa la frente – algún día volverás a mí – me susurra -La verdad espero que eso nunca suceda -Sucederá, créeme, pero no dudes en acudir a mí – me ofrece su mano - ¿amigos? No quiero discutir, quiero que todo termine de la mejor manera así que le doy mi mano – Amigos – el me jala y besa con desesperación, quizás sea nuestro último beso, así que le correspondo -Perdóname, necesitaba hacerlo – se acerca a mi oído – en verdad quiero que seas feliz – se va rápidamente dejándome sola. Me siento el ser más despreciable, alguien que juega con sentimientos ajenos, Dios, espero que no sea un error esto que estoy haciendo. Lavo toda la vajilla que ensuciamos, subo a mi cuarto. Antes de dormirme agarro mi celular y envió un mensaje a Josh, necesita saberlo, espero que se alegre, por lo menos uno de ellos tendrá tranquilidad esta noche. - Listo, lo que debía hacer ya lo hice Apago mi celular, pues no quiero que me llame ni nada. Mañana será otro día, para bien o para mal, lo hecho, hecho esta.[Chapter 17] Capítulo 17 Aunque la esperanza me embarga, la amargura también me persigue. No lo puedo evitar, ella me dijo que lo aclarara pero me hace pensar que ella no me elegirá. -Tranquilo hermano, quiero llegar vivo a la casa -No me puedo calmar, necesito una copa, por favor cúbreme -No vas a ir a tomar, ¿estás loco? Tú no bebes Josh -Connor, algún día me entenderás, siento la necesidad de tomar una copa, por favor cúbreme en casa te prometo que no me emborracharé ni nada, solo necesito estar solo -Waaao en verdad estás enamorado, ¿la amas? -No lo sé, creo que es muy pronto para decirlo pero ella se metió en mi piel, no sé qué hacer si no me acepta -Tranquilo hermano, yo creo que ella también te quiere, pero entiéndela que es difícil dejar a alguien que conoce desde hace mucho por alguien, es normal que tenga dudas.. además a ti te rodena muchas cosas que no son del todo buenas, la fama y el dinero pueden hacerte ver como alguien que solo quiere jugar con sus sentimientos, pero sinceramente creo que ella se va a arriesgar, ahora depende de ti hacer que todos esos miedos se acaben -Yo también tengo miedo – digo frustrado – es la primera vez que siento algo así, no quiero sufrir, no soy bueno dejando escapar las cosas, pero no quiero obligarla, tengo miedo de que no me elija o peor aún, que me elija y luego se arrepienta - Hermano me sorprendes, tu nunca has sido inseguro, ya me da miedo enamorarme a mí también – dice tratando de elevarme el ánimo. Me estaciono frente a un bar que está cerca de la casa, le doy a Connor el auto, por suerte si sabe conducir y a esta hora dudo que la policía lo moleste Me coloco las gafas para que nadie me reconozca, entro al bar me dirijo a la barra, pido una copa de la bebida más fuerte que tienen. Nunca me he enamorado, en verdad creí estarlo otras veces, pero ahora que siento esto tan fuerte por ella sé que estuve equivocado. No sé si deba decir amor, quizás es muy pronto, pero siento que ya estoy sufriendo. Bien han dicho los grandes sabios, el amor solo te trae problemas. Ellos hacen una muy linda pareja, debo reconocerlo aunque me duela. Él la mira con amor, se que la ama, y ella también lo quiere, no sé si me ciega mi esperanza de que ella me quiera y no veo su amor por él; pero confío en sus palabras, en sus promesas.. Siento como vibra mi celular: - Listo, lo que debía hacer ya lo hice Debería saltar de emoción por ello, pero no puedo, trato de llamarla y me desvía a buzón. No quiere saber de mí, quizás se arrepintió, quizás se dio cuenta de que lo que acaba de hacer es un error y que no siente nada por mí… No sé cómo seguiré si no estoy con ella, el recuerdo de sus labios nunca se irá… la quiero y me prometí a mí mismo, a la vida y a ella que nunca me daré por vencido, pero ¿Qué hago si su felicidad está con él? Lucharé, lo haré, ella me está dando esa oportunidad, pero juro que si no soy su felicidad, la dejaré ir, después de todo confío en hacerla feliz, como ella me hace a mí. Regreso a mi casa, no estoy ebrio pero siento que mañana mi cabeza arderá. Entro a mi habitación por suerte nadie se ha dado cuenta. Me acomodo en mi cama y trato de dormir. Mañana será otro día, donde a lucharé con todas mis fuerzas por esa mujer y confío en que Dios me ayude. -Josh, ¿estas vivo? Me tenías preocupado hermano – Connor entra gritando, abre las ventanas y n verdad quiero matarlo, me arde la cabeza -Últimamente tengo ganas de golpearte Connor- digo lanzándole una almohada y fallando patéticamente -Anímate, llame a Alex y le pedí que nos llevara a algún sitio donde podamos nadar, dice que a las afueras de la ciudad hay un balneario de aguas termales, llega en 10 minutos, así que más vale que te pongas en traje de conquista -¿Qué? Mierda Connor, debiste despertarme antes – corro y me meto a la ducha, salgo y me coloco unos bermudas y llevo ropa para meterme a la piscina. Salgo al pasillo y ahí esta ella. Hermosísima, con un short muy bonito que hace lucir sus hermosas piernas, una blusa holgada y su cabello suelto y alborotado, lleva unas gafas negras -Voy por mi bolso – dice Connor, y al pasar por mi lado me susurra – quieres una taza para depositar tu baba, cierra la boca o la asustarás -Hola – me dice ella con una ligera sonrisa que no llega a sus ojos -Hola – me acerco, tomo su mano y la beso en sus nudillos -Basta, no hagas eso, me produce cosquillas – su sonrisa ahora es sincera -Alex, yo... – suspiro- yo… -Ya vámonos – Connor regreso, voy a tener que enseñarle a que deje de ser inoportuno. Salimos, subimos al auto y ella conduce fuera de la ciudad. Connor y Alex hablan muy animados pero yo no me concentro en lo que ellos hablan, cuando llegamos es un lugar muy hermoso. Según me explicaba Alex son aguas que provienen de un antiguo volcán apagado supuestamente. Mientras caminamos hacia una Hostería el agua circula a nuestros lados y vapor sale de ella. Entramos a los vestidores y salgo rápidamente y salto a la piscina, seguido de Connor. Espero ver a Alex en un traje baño, por mi cabeza pasan un montón de imágenes de ella con su hermoso cuerpo en un sexy bañador. Veo que se abre su vestidor y la veo. Quizás mi parte morbosa se decepciona pero en verdad amo verla. Se colocó otro short de tela licra que se le ajusta a la piel y una blusa straples que cubre todo su torso, pero enseña sus hermosos hombros, donde me muero por dejar mis besos. Camina hacia el trampolín, creo que va a saltar -¿Sabes nadar? – pregunta Connor -No, pero amo hacer esto – salta antes de que pueda reaccionar, nado hacia donde ella brinco, como se le ocurre lanzarse en la parte más profunda si no sabe nadar - Alex – empiezo a gritar cuando no la veo y todos los de la piscina giran a verme -Tranquilo, aquí estoy – giro y la veo agarrada del filo de la piscina ¿Cómo llego ahí? -¿Cómo llegaste ahí? Dijiste que no sabías nadar -No, no sé pero si se flotar, nunca me ahogo, es fácil y muevo mis manos para tomar impulso, digamos que se puede considerar que nado – suelto el aire, no sabía que lo estaba conteniendo – deberías de dejar el drama Josh, estoy bien- me guiña el ojo Nado hacia ella, pongo mis brazos a cada lado para evitar que se me escape. Ella me mira a los ojos, no puedo deducir su expresión. Antes de que yo hable ella dice: -¿Quieres ir hoy a una fiesta? -Ehh... claro, contigo a donde tú quieras – ella se sonroja -Luego hablamos de eso... ahora dime ¿Qué estás haciendo? – mira mis manos a cada lado -Quiero disfrutarte – ella levanta la ceja – no te he tenido tan cerca últimamente, por cierto te ves hermosa – le susurro en un oído, y es verdad, sus rizos mojados enmarcan su rostro, ella luce linda siempre sin maquillaje, tan natural, esos grandes ojos brillan y me ven directamente. Bajo mis brazos y la paso por su cintura acercándola, ella sigue sonrojada -Debo admitir que se siente bien – pasa sus brazos por mi cuello, y me mira con picardía, me acerco lentamente para besarla, ya no soporto más…. -Ohhh escucha, es mi canción – diablos, escucho y por los parlantes empieza una melodía muy lenta, veo que se le forma una sonrisa dulce y triste a la vez, ella me abraza y empieza a cantarla en mi oído: (Desde que te vi – Natalino: www_youtube_com/watch?v=K6JnnbDQKNs ) Cada letra de esa canción me recuerda a ella, cada frase quisiera dedicársela, una canción hermosa y más aún escucharla con su voz. Ese coro nos cae como anillo al dedo, siento como mi corazón pega brincos, nunca la había escuchado pero es como si yo la hubiera escrito para ella, nos movemos de un lado al otro, aun abrazados al ritmo de la canción…. Es verdad, desde que la conocí me cautivo, ella llena mi vida, todo es perfecto cuando estoy a su lado, todo es distinto desde que la vi… desde que la vi una flecha me clavó, su embrujo me cautivo y caí entre sus redes, ahora ella es mi vida. Termina la canción y aún seguimos abrazados, en verdad fue un momento mágico, como si entes mundo solo existiéramos nosotros… y quiero que sea así, solo ella y yo por siempre -Sabes – suspira – es la canción más perfecta que he escuchado, siempre he soñado que alguien me la dedique, y será el momento perfecto, porque yo lo amaré y el a mí, y esa será nuestra historia… Me separo y la veo a sus ojos, brillan y ahí estoy reflejado… y otra vez mas me prometo a mí mismo luchar, luchar por ella, por mí y por nosotros… Este es el mágico momento indicado, junto mis labios a los suyos… ella me corresponde, tan cálida, tan llena de dulzura y amor… la conexión entre nosotros es inexplicable. Nuestros labios se acoplan perfectamente, nuestros brazos también lo hace, y sé que este es mi lugar en el mundo, junto a ella… no sé cómo una mujer pudo adueñarse de todo mi ser, pero no me molesta, quiero que ella sea la dueña de mi vida Nos separamos por falta de aire, y veo que todos nos miran -Será mejor que no hagamos eso, nos sacaran de la piscina por inmorales – dice ella sonriendo -Sabes que no me importa, lo haría mil veces y no me importaría si el mundo se derrumbara -¿Ah no? Quieres ver noticias donde digan: JOSH HUTCHERSON EXPULSADO DE UNA PISCINA POR ACTOS INMORALES -Ya dije, no me interesa siempre que pueda besarte de nuevo -Claro, a ti te da igual salir en la prensa, pero yo no quisiera que mis papis vean eso, me matarían y en verdad fuera demasiado vergonzoso -Está bien, no quiero arruinarlo, pero no pienses que dejaré de besarte - le doy un guiño -No quiero que dejes de hacerlo – me besa en la comisura de mis labios y se aleja nuevamente de mí Disfrutamos mucho este paseo, jugamos, saltamos, nadamos, bailamos. Connor y Alex son muy competitivos y me agrada eso de ella, nunca se da por vencida. No es de las típicas chicas que se alocan por no estar vestidas a la moda o por no lucir bien frente a otros, ella es natural, sencilla y humilde…. Todo mundo la llega a querer, porque es fácil amar a alguien como ella. No deje pasar la oportunidad para tomarnos fotos, en verdad quiero atesorar todos nuestros momentos... Por suerte mi cámara no se daña con el agua, así que aproveche para tomarnos muchas. Aunque sé que no las publicaré, por lo poco que hemos hablado a ella no le gusta estar en boca de nadie, tengo que convencerla, porque yo quiero presentarle al mundo a esta maravillosa mujer, que me tiene loco, pero esa lo lograré de poco a poco.. Primero tengo pedirle formalmente que sea mi novia. Salimos del balneario, y nos dirigíamos a casa, desde que salimos le tome de la mano y entrelace nuestros dedos. Era la persona más afortunada, me sentía más feliz, como nunca lo he estado, me sentía completo, tenía buenos amigos, el mejor trabajo, la mejor familia y ahora había encontrado el amor. Mientras conducimos ella me explica la dirección de la fiesta. Luego ella conecta su celular al auto y empieza a sonar música -Perdonen si no les gusta mi música pero ya me estaba estresando con la radio -Bueno yo tenía la curiosidad de escuchar tu música – confieso, en verdad la mayoría delas canciones nunca las había oído, ella tiene una gran variedad, desde rock, baladas, en inglés y español, no es mala música, me gusta, tendré que pedirle una copia de sus canciones favorita, si voy a ser su novio necesito saber todo de ella. -¿Cómo se llama esa canción?- le pregunto, es muy buena para dedicarla, un tanto triste -Si yo fuera tú, es muy linda – asiento, y ella la está tarareando Llegamos a su casa, ella se despide de Connor y yo rápidamente me bajo a abrirle la puerta -Gracias señor caballerosidad -Para servirte mi princesa -Entonces ¿nos vemos a las 9pm en la fiesta? -Ahí estaré – tomo su mano y le beso -Preferiría que vengas en taxi, para no preocuparnos por el auto -Claro princesa, ahí estaré, si me pierdo te llamo a tu celular, estoy ansioso por verte esta noches – le susurro, y ella se sonroja - Adiós Josh – se despide agitando su mano, empieza a subir los 2 escalones que están en la entrada de su casa, cuando la tomo del brazo y la jalo contra mí, como la cojo desprevenida ella pierde el equilibrio y cae sobre mí, yo la atrapo en un beso urgente. Ella corresponde mi beso completamente, cuando se detiene y sonríe contra mis labios -Si vuelves a hacer eso, te haré pagar Hutcherson, algún momento vas a fallar en atraparme y me voy a estampar contra el piso -No te preocupes, nunca te dejara caer, además quiero ver cómo me lo harías pagar – sonrío pícaramente -Nos vemos más tarde -Estoy ansioso mi vida – subo rápidamente a mi auto, y veo como ella está en su puerta con una gran sonrisa Cuando llego a mi casa solo se me acurre subir una foto de ella y yo en la piscina, estamos abrazados, ella de espaldas, mirándome, apenas se puede distinguir su perfil, pero se puede ver su sonrisa y la mía. Abro Facebook y con la frase: \"DESDE QUE TE VI….. AHORA NO PUEDO DEJARLO DE HACER\" y la canción que quiero dedicarle, espero que le llegue, después de todo le gusta esta canción: (Si yo fuera tú – Servando y Florentino: www_youtube_com/watch?v=B_1tnw-8UHE ) Ahora todo el mundo sabrá que me cautivaron, Josh Hutcherson está enamorado. Luego miro su perfil y mi humor cambia rápidamente… Ese chico, tenía que sacarme de mis casillas. Le publico una canción en su muro: (Lejos estamos mejor – Motel: www_youtube_com/watch?v=4aWG-pw3NwY ) con la frase \"Es exactamente lo que pienso y siento\"[Chapter 18] Capítulo 18 Ha sido una gran día, uno de los mejores de la vida. Luego de saludar a mi mamá, llamo a Fer y Santy para ponernos de acuerdo en la hora y lugar para ir a la fiesta. No puedo dejar de pensar en esos besos, creo que me volveré adictos a ellos. Abro Facebook, en verdad es un vicio para mí, encuentro una canción de Darío, es una muy linda canción pero me hace sentir culpable. Tiene razón, todo iba bien entre nosotros, si Josh no hubiera aparecido en nuestras vidas, nada de esto pasara, estaríamos juntos, felices, juntos….. Entro en el perfil de Josh y veo una foto de nosotros muy sonrientes, gracias al cielo es difícil de reconocerme, al menos eso, no quiero que la prensa se meta en mi vida, se que Josh no tiene problema con eso, pero yo sí. Sonrío al ver la frase: \"DESDE QUE TE VI….. AHORA NO PUEDO DEJARLO DE HACER\", esas palabras a cualquiera le sacan una sonrisa Yo tampoco puedo dejarlo de hacer, miro los miles de MG, bueno este niño quiere que todo mundo se enteré, sé que será inevitable, pero trataré de que pase pronto, además ni yo sé lo que somos ¿novios? ¿pareja? ¿amigos con derecho?. Me da vergüenza preguntar, pero tendré que hacerlo pronto, porque no estoy dispuesta a compartirlo con nadie. - Nos vemos mami -Vendrás pronto Alex, y por favor pídele a Santiago que te acompañe hasta la casa, no quiero que te pase nada -Tranquila mami, me voy ya me están esperando Le beso a mi mamá y salgo para encontrarme con Fer, Santy y Darío. Mierda, pensé que tal vez no vendría. Ni modo tarde o temprano tendría que enfrentarlo, el problema es que no tuve tiempo de advertir a Josh. Caminos a la casa de mi amigo Arturo, queda a unos 15 minutos a pie de mi casa. Llegamos a la 9pm en punto y no había rastros de Josh. Para mala hora, había olvidado mi celular, espero que no se pierda. -Yo sé que quieres verlo, pero no te haría mal bailar conmigo mientras esperas – Darío me dirige la palabra en toda la noche, ofreciéndome su mano para bailar -No sé si deberíamos – le contesto avergonzada -Tranquila, quedamos en que seríamos amigos y los amigos bailan ¿verdad? – asiento y él me toma de la mano, mi amigo Arturo pone música de todo tipo, desde reggeaton, electrónica, salsa merengue. Para mi suerte estaba sonando un reggeaton un poco antiguo: (Hasta abajo – Don Omar: www_youtube_com/watch?v=E0FRj4DcBF0 ) y aunque al inicio estuve recelosa, termine bailando como me gustaba hacer, bien… Con intensidad, él me acerco a su cuerpo y empezamos a balancearnos. Nunca olvidare cuando le enseñe a Darío a bailar, él se sentía mal porque yo lo acababa cuando bailaba así que pasamos muchas horas practicando. Y ahora estamos aquí, balanceándonos de un lado al otro, con nuestro muy juntos, un baile quizá muy sensual pero no puedo evitar bailarlo como se debe. Seguimos la música, bajamos, subimos, nos balanceamos en todos los lados, cuando decido girar y quedar de espaldas a él, me percató de su presencia. Luce unos jeans, y una casaca de cuero. También un gorro y unas gafas oscuras para ocultar su identidad. Se quita sus gafas y me mira fijamente, sus ojos llenos de furia, celos, decepción. Me doy cuenta que no debería haber hecho esto. No tiene nada de malo bailar, pero este tipo de contacto con mi ex no es el más adecuado estos momentos. Él se queda quieto mirándonos, se recuesta sobre la pared y cruza los brazos. Esa actitud me enoja, no sé qué esperaba, que me arme una escenita de celos, pero luego de la forma en que me miro, se comporta como si no le importara. Así que decido ignorarlo y sigo bailando. Me doy cuenta que Darío se percató de su presencia y se tensa un poco. Me gira, pongo mis manos en sus hombros y me susurra -Espero no meterte en problemas -Tranquilo, no estamos haciendo nada de malo -Quizás, pero no sabes las ganas que tengo de hacer algo malo – me sonrojo de su comentario y por suerte la canción termina, me aparto de él y camino hacia Josh -Hola – le digo acercándome para saludarlo con un beso en la mejilla, él se aparta y me toma del brazo muy bruscamente y me saca del salón llevándome al jardín. Me lleva lo más lejos para que nadie pueda escucharnos, me suelta bruscamente dejándome contra la pared. Pasa sus manos por su rostro sujetándose la nariz, veo que está frustrado pero trata de contener su ira. Finalmente me mira, se acerca a mí y pone una mano a cada lado de mi cara, aprisionándome contra la pared, se acerca a mí quedando a solo centímetros, su respiración es entrecortada y agitada -¿Y bien? ¿Vas a decirme que hacías con él? – suelta furioso -Bailar – le digo con tono despreocupado -¿bailar? Quizás tú llamas bailar a esa danza erótica entre ustedes, pero claramente vi como sus manos te tocaban, sus ojos te miraban con deseo… -Dios Josh – digo bajando sus brazos de mi lado – No exageres, ¿erótico? ¿en serio? No me hagas reír, ¿Qué te pasa? – Odio las actitudes posesivas, y esta actitud suya me enfada – No me vengas con que no puedo bailar con nadie, por favor Me mira frustrado – Alex, no quiero.. – respira profundo – Nunca había sentido esto – suelta un suspiro – Mierda, es horrible sentir celos, pero él…. Y tu… ustedes -Ok ok, primero piensa lo que vas a decirme – me siento enfadada, acepto que es mi culpa, pero odio que piensen que me pueden mandar, y decirme lo que tengo que hacer -Se supone que yo tendría que reclamarte a ti por estar con él... y aquí estás haciéndome sentir fatal por ponerme celoso -Tú no tienes nada que reclamarme, y yo tampoco tengo porque darte explicaciones de mi vida, así como yo no pido explicaciones de la tuya – suelto enfada -Dios…! ¿Te han dicho alguna vez que eres frustrante? No puedo deducir lo que pasa por tu cabeza – me canse de esta discusión sin sentido. Lo empujo abriéndome paso, él me toma de laman y tira de mí. Pasa su mano por mi cintura y la otra sujeta mi nuca y me acerca a sus labios. Su beso es desesperado, la verdad no lo disfruto, pero cuando se tranquiliza me dejo llevar. Creo que se siente más tranquilo, afloja un poco el agarre y pasa sus manos por mis hombros y mis brazos. Recorre con sus palmas ese trayecto uno y otra vea. Su beso se trona dulce y delicado. Este tipo de besos si disfruto, besos que me tramitan paz y satisfacción, no esos que me oprimen y me hacen sentir como si alguien fuera mi dueño. Nunca he sido buena para que me dominen y si él piensa que haré todo lo que él quiera, puesta está muy equivocado. -Olvide decirte que luces hermosa – me susurra cuando termina nuestro beso -Pregúntame si me importa tu opinión – digo abriéndome paso nuevamente y otra vez el tira de mi brazo -Lo siento ¿si? – me toma por los hombros y mira dulcemente – no te enojes conmigo, por favor compréndeme -¿que quieres que te comprenda? Vienes aquí, me tratas bruscamente, y ahora quieres decirme lo que tengo y no que hacer? Vas a decirme con quien hablo o bailo? Si es así VETE AL DIABLO, JOSH Mi mira como si no supiera que decirme – Lo lamento, pero es frustrante no tener el control… nunca puedo predecir lo que harás, no como actuaras y encima mi inexperiencia con el amor y estos nuevos sentimientos, celos, rabia, no sé cómo actuar, por favor tenme paciencia… no quiero obligarte a hacer nada que no quieras – mira al piso – pero verte con él, tan cerca, en verdad me da celos, ustedes son el uno para el otro y me siento como el intruso, como el malo de la película.. - Diablos Josh, aun no empezamos una relación y ya estamos rodeados de inseguridades – miro al piso, no quiero que esto vaya mal, me estoy arriesgando a mucho y no quiero perder -Lo lamento tanto – me abraza y pone su rostro en el agujero de mi cuello – no te enojes, por favor, cambiaré, trataré de que no te sientas oprimida por mí, solo quiero que no te apartes de mí Y con eso derrumbo todas mis barreras, no puedo creer que él también sufra esas inseguridades. Mi rabia se esfumo, ahora siento una patada en el estómago. Él quiere cambiar por mí y yo no estoy dispuesta a entenderlo, soy una mala persona -No lo lamentes, perdóname a mí, no sabía que esto te haría sentir mal, pero en serio no me gusta que me digan lo que tengo que hacer, no soy de esas personas que esperan que otros dicten mi vida -Lo sé – su aliento en mi cuello causa cosquillas – ni yo sé lo que me ocurre cuando estoy contigo, no quiero que cambies en absoluto tu forma de ser – suspira - ¿me perdonas? -Te quiero – espero que eso responda su pregunta – no lo olvides -Y yo más – beso su frente y el besa mi cuello haciéndome estremecer – me asusta quererte tanto Nos fundimos nuevamente en un cálido beso, todo nuestro enojo queda olvidado, por lo menos de mi parte, no sé qué hizo este chico conmigo, pero me hace tomar ser diferente… - Oigan no quiero ser aguafiestas, pero recuerden están dando un buen espectáculo, si quieren les puedo prestar mi habitación - somos interrumpidos por mi amigo Arturo, pero seguimos con nuestras frentes unidas. - Muy oportuno Arturo - digo con sarcasmo y luego escucho su carcajada. - Gracias. Pues a mí me llaman el señor oportuno - Josh no aguanta la risa y se une a sus carcajadas, sigue mirándome a los ojos – En serio Alex, me sorprendes tu o eres de esas chicas que se besuquean a la vista de todos ¿Qué te está pasando? -Tonto – me río separando de Josh, el gira y me abraza – Solo estábamos… mmmm… conversando -Jajaja creo que me agrada tu forma de \"conversar\" , si quieres puede enseñarme, quiero aprender – siento como Josh se tensa y aprieta mi mano, creo que esta celoso, algo que es absurdo porque mi amigo aquí presente es así de coqueto, es su personalidad – ¿Y a quien tenemos aquí? ¿No me vas a presentar a tu….? No sé qué responder, debería decir que Josh es mi ¿amigo? ¿novio? ¿pareja? -Soy su novio – Josh extiende su mano y me mira con dulzura – Mucho gusto Arturo -Waooo novio? Yo pensé que tenías algo con Darío – Josh vuelve a tensarse y apreta mi mano – Pero bueno, Bienvenido a la familia – extiende sus brazos para abrazar a Josh y el dudosamente lo corresponde, yo río por las ocurrencias de mi amigo – Te juro que si le haces algo a mi pequeña, te buscare por cielo, mar y tierra y patearé tu trasero -Tranquilo, yo sería incapaz de hacerle daño – me abraza y besa la frente -¿Tú no eres de aquí verdad?¿Lo digo por tu acento? -No, no soy, yo soy de EEUU -Supongo que se conocieron allá – nos dice Arturo señalándonos, ambos asentimos – Tu cara se me hace conocida, no sé por qué – no sé qué decirle, yo sé que Josh no quiere que se enteren de que esta en este país, porque los paparazis no lo dejaría en paz, ni a sus abuelos, además yo tampoco quiero enfrentarme a ese mundo, lo quiero a él, pero esa parte de él no me agrada del todo… -SI eres fanático al cine, quizás me hayas visto – Josh se quita el sombrero, en verdad quiere que lo reconozcan. Miro a Santy que está confundido, creo que sospecha quien es, pero es difícil aceptar que una persona tan famosa este en tu casa -Viaje al centro de la tierra? THG? – le digo y él abre sus ojos muy ampliamente -No puede ser ¿eres Josh Hutcherson? Waoooo, es increíble, un gusto conocerte – dice tan rápidamente que causa risa – Dios, Alex, tu novio es fantástico, es un honor tenerte en mi fiesta -El honor es mío… ahora puedo pedirte un favor? – Dice Josh, me quedo viéndolo tratando descifrar que quiere -Claro hermano -Podrías prestarnos tu habitación – mi sonrojo debe ser evidente, siento como mis mejillas arden, que diablos quiere hacer – No es para lo que piensas, necesito hablar con mi NOVIA sin que nadie nos interrumpa – dijo la palabra novia con un tono un poco duro, ¿de qué quiere hablar? - Claro, síganme – Josh me jala de la mano y seguimos a mi amigo, que nos lleva a su habitación – Bueno los dejo solos -Arturo – dice Josh – Gracias, no quiero abusar de tu confianza, pero no estamos listos para que todos se enteren quien soy, te revele mi identidad porque sé que eres de confianza -No te preocupes hermano, seré prudente, pero más les conviene venir pronto a bailar – nos dice y sale de la habitación, la luz se apaga y siento como Josh posa su mirada en mí y me abraza por detrás sujetándome la cintura, apoya su mentón en mi hombro y caminamos hasta la ventana, donde podemos ver como la luz se filtra y apenas ilumina nuestras siluetas, en verdad es algo muy hermoso, el ambiente y desde luego la compañía -¿Así que soy tu novia? – rompo el silencio -Bueno si tú no quieres, no – suelta el aire – yo quiero ser lo que tú necesites que sea, pero debo admitir que me ilusionaba con la idea de que fueras mi novia -Yo también tenía la ilusión de ser tu novia, pero… -¿pero? ¿Qué pasa? – él se tensa preocupado, apretando su agarre -No me lo has pedido – suelto inocentemente, la verdad es que quiero oírle decirme esas palabras -Tienes razón – besa mi mejilla – soy un tonto – se separa de mí, se pone de frente y toma mi mano, veo como se agacha y apoya su pierna en el piso y flexiona la otra – Alex, preciosa, me harías el gran honor de ser la persona que comparta conmigo mis alegrías y tristezas, ser la persona que me acepte tal y como soy, aceptarías a este chico enamorado para ser parte de tu vida… -No puede simplemente decirme que sea tu novia? – lo interrumpo, él me sonríe - ¿Quieres ser mi novia? – suelta sonriendo, y besa mi mano, yo decido quedarme en silencio, veo como me mira con impaciencia, y no sé por qué lo disfruto, no quiero hacer sufrir, pero se ve tan tierno, que no puedo evitarlo - ¿te gusta verme sufrir verdad? -Sí – suelto riendo -¿Si te gusta verme sufrir? Ó ¿si quieres ser mi novia? -Las dos cosas – él se pone de pie y me besa, siento como un cosquilleo recorre todo mi cuerpo. Soy feliz, soy verdaderamente feliz, este chico me quiere y yo a él. Más que nunca me siento contenta de haberme arriesgado y no quiero pensar en las consecuencias, solo quiero vivir el día a día. Hola espero q esten disfrutándola historia, es mi nueva cuenta xq la anterior q tenia se bloqueo, asi q decidí aventurarme en esta historia de mi Amor Platonico \"Josh\", la idea de la historia es q no tenga mucho drama, todo lo contrario sea lo mas probable posible como si pudiera pasar, ahora tendremos muchos capítulos de amor, un noviazgo q se podria considerar \"normal\" pero les prometo mas adelante mucha emoción ...3 Milet[Chapter 19] Capítulo 19 Sus labios, son tan cálidos y suaves… se amoldan perfectamente a los míos. Nunca me cansaré de esto, nunca me cansaré de sentirme en las nubes cuando estoy con ella. Una vez que conoces el paraíso obviamente no quieres dejarlo y con ella no hay nada más que pueda pedir. Ella es mi propia marca de heroína, sus besos mi droga persona. Hace tan solo unos meses no sabía que pudiera llegar a ser tan dichoso, ¿Quién diría que el amor puede cambiar las personas? ¿amor? ¿amor? ¿Es lo que siento? No estoy seguro, pero creo que es amor. Nunca lo he sentido, pero creo que algo tan grande y puro debe ser amor. Puedes haber tenido muchas personas en tu vida, pero cuando encuentras a la correcta es como una revelación, no se exista el amor a primera vista pero cuando la tienes en tu frente es imposible ignorarla, sientes la atracción y el interés, y aunque te niegues necesitas tenerla. Y eso es lo que siento, agradezco a la vida por permitirme tenerla, ahora no pienso perderla. -Amo cuando haces eso – sonríe sobre mis labios -¿Qué te bese? -SI, eso y que me tomes por sorpresa -Pues lo haré cada vez que quieres – me separo, la tomo del rostro y junto nuestras frentes – gracias, gracias por hacerme tan feliz -Pues no creo estar haciendo nada en especial -Lo haces, el solo respirar me hace feliz – sé que sueno cursi, pero no lo puedo evitar con ella, las frases solo salen desde mi corazón -Dios, eres muy cursi – dice sonriendo -Si no te gusta las cursilerías trataré de evitarlas, pero las cosas que te digo salen de mi corazón -Creo que puedo acostumbrarme a eso – me besa – puedo acostumbrarme a todo lo que eres -¿y que soy? -Eres mío – junta nuestros labios, nunca me cansaría de ellos, y mucho menos cuando ella es quien toma la iniciativa – creo que deberíamos ir a bailar, conozco a Arturo y sé que es capaz de venirnos a buscar -Tienes razón, vamos – la tomo de la mano y salimos de la habitación – creo que deberías enseñarme a bailar -Tú sabes bailar, ¿recuerdas cómo nos conocimos? -Sí, pero solo sé bailar coreografías, no lo hago con naturalidad, a menos que sea electrónica, hip-hop y lo que se baila en mi país -Mmmmm, eso podemos arreglarlo – la sujeto de la cintura y la abrazo por detrás, apoyo mi mentón en su hombro y continuó caminando – sabes que no es fácil caminar así -Lo sé – digo y beso su cuello que le hace estremecer, estoy seguro que su cuerpo reacciona a mi contacto – Pero quiero sentirte lo más cerca posible -Pues tendrás que soltarme para bailar -No te preocupes, no te soltaré toda la noche – ella me mira y pone cara de susto – tranquila es una broma, prometo controlarme, puedes bailar con quien desees – aunque eso me enfade -Eso me gusta, pero primero quiero bailar contigo -Pues no permitiría que bailes con otra persona hasta que no lo hagas conmigo – me puse mi gorro y mis gafas, cuando entramos al salón, todos nos quedaron viendo. Yo sé que no me reconocieron pero me imagino que sabían de la relación de Alex y Darío. Recorro sus rostros y veo Fernanda y Santiago bailando. Luego veo a Darío, nos mira con rabia, es normal creo, después de todo yo me interpuse entre ellos. Pero no pienso perderla, eso debe tenerlo por seguro. -Arturo! – Alex lo llama y él viene de inmediato – Puedes poner salsa -¿Qué canción? -Me tiene loco – Arturo asiente – Vamos a hacer una coreografía -y se va a donde el Dj -¿vamos a qué? – no está loca, yo no puedo bailar -Dale Josh, no me digas que tienes miedo, no creo que te hayas olvidado tan rápido al coreografía -Pero estamos en una fiesta, no creo que debemos ser el espectáculo – no quiero hacerlo -Yo con mi amigo Eduardo – me señala un chico al otro lado del salón – siempre improvisamos y hacemos un pequeño baile para que todos lo disfruten, no habrá problema, tú y yo sabemos la coreografía -Alex, por favor no me hagas esto – le digo en tono de súplica -Por favor Josh – pone un puchero – quiero bailar con mi novio – y me convenció -Está bien – justo la música termina y Arturo empieza a hablar - Amigos, como siempre saben que nuestra querida amiga Alex, nos sabe deleitar con una baile para entretenernos, esta vez lo hará con su nuevo novio, lo siento Eduardo, ya encontró pareja de baile – señala a Eduardo y todos ríen – Dale Dj – grita Arturo y la canción empieza: ( Puerto Rican Power - Me Tiene Loco www_youtube_com/watch?v=uut8Cu6K2jI) Ella me toma de la mano y me lleva al centro del salón, todos se apartan y nos dejan espacio. Empezamos a bailar, no puedo creer lo avergonzado que me siento. Pero al mirarla a los ojos es como si solo estuviéramos nosotros. Amo ver la pasión de sus ojos cuando baila. Es bueno bailar esta canción, me recuerda cuando nos conocimos. Obviamente nos lucimos con nuestra coreografía, los giros y cargadas nos salieron a la perfección. Escuchando la canción me recuerda a ella, últimamente todo me recuerda a ella. Pero es verdad, no sé qué hacer con ella, me tiene loco. Terminamos y todos nos aplauden. Ella se ve llena de energía, respiramos agitados porque en verdad es pesado bailar así de rápido y con tanta precisión. Pero me encanta verla feliz. -Gracias Josh – dice al oído -Lo que fuera por ti – me siento en un sofá y tiro de ella para que se siente en mi regazo – ahora vas a tener que enseñarme -Espera recupero el aliento y me pongo en eso – la beso en el hombro. La miro y me doy cuenta que es una muy bella mujer, y con esa ropa que usa en esta ocasión se ve muy sexy. Usa un short jean negro y con medias de aspecto de red negros y unos tacos, altos para mi gusto. No sé cómo puede caminar y aun peor bailar con ellos, pero debo admitir que estiliza sus piernas. Gracias al cielo estamos a la misma altura, me sentiría mal siendo más bajito que ella. Su blusa es ajustada en su busto y holgada el resto, enseña la piel de su hombros y cuello lo que la hace lucir sexy, pero elegante. Su cabello está liso, le queda muy bien aunque amos sus rizos alborotados. -Te dije que estas hermosa ¿verdad? -SI lo hiciste – sonríe picaronamente -Pero extraño tus rizos alborotados – beso su mejilla -Josh basta – dice sonrojada – tus besos me ponen nerviosa - ¿por qué? – digo besando su hombro -No me dejan pensar – yo continúo besando su hombro – Eres de lo peor – me lanzo sobre sus labios con un beso dulce -Si quieres, no te vuelvo a besar – le digo seductoramente -Juegas sucio Hutcherson -Es tú decisión mi vida – le sonrío dándole un beso fugaz -Mejor vamos a bailar, amo el merengue - se pone de pie y me ofrece su mano, me lleva donde todos están bailando (Chica Sexy – Banda XXI www_4shared_com/mp3/01ibd2iS/Chica_ ) -¿Y cómo bailo esto? - Sigue mi paso, es como si marcharas – la imito y trato de coger ritmo – bien, si ves que es fácil – me toma de las manos y me guía para hacer giros - Waoooooooo, no sabía que podíamos hacer eso -Puedes hacer los mismos giros en todo tipo de música, solo los pasos básicos son diferentes -Bueno pues yo quiero aprender a bailar muy bien para que solo quieras hacerlo conmigo -Eso ya lo veremos – bailamos varias piezas, me encantó hacerlo, es lindo hacer cosas nuevas con la persona que quieres. Cosas que nunca imaginaste hacer. Ella me dijo que ama las fiestas de su amigo porque no simplemente pone música del momento como reggaetón y electrónica, si no suena de todo. Luego de un rato bailando sonó una canción que ella dijo que era reggaetón del antiguo. La verdad nunca lo había escuchado pero sonaba interesante bailarlo (Pegao – Wisin & Yandel www_4shared_com/mp3/Hd2W65FM/PEGAO_WISIN_Y_ ? ) -Bueno llego la ahora de probarte, solo sigue mi movimiento – ella se pone de espaldas, se pega a mí, toma mis manos y las pone en sus caderas, tengo que tomar aire para poder controlarme – De un lado al otro, sígueme Sus movimientos eran como un péndulo de un lado al otro, nuestros cuerpos en contacto, se rozaban. Quizás ella no se daba cuenta pero este baile me está provocando. En otras ocasiones si me hubiera sentido de esta manera, en menos de 15 minutos tendría a esa chica entre mis sábanas. Dios su ritmo me estaba volviendo loco, y mi viejo amigo estaba despertando de su largo sueño. Gracias al cielo ella se alejó un poco y se volteo. Puso sus brazos alrededor de mi cuello puso su pierna izquierda entre la mía y continuo balanceándose. -Lo estás haciendo bien – me guiña el ojo y tomo aire, la mezcla cambia de canción: (Zundada – Zion y Lennox www_youtube_com/watch?v=NG70GnV8Aws ) – Esta es más suave, así que te dejare llevarme, yo seguiré tu paso -¿estas segura? Yo no creo dominarlo aun -Lo estás haciendo – paso mis manos por su cintura y la abrazo pegándola a mi cuerpo, escucho como ella canta las canciones, pero lo único que puedo pensar es nuestros cuerpo juntos y sus movimientos sexys pero delicados – aprendes rápido mi pequeño saltamontes No sé qué tiempo pasamos así, pero creo que ya le cogí el paso, cuando la canción volvió a cambiar: (Agárrala – Trebol Clan www_youtube_com/watch?v=aT65Zu4gsdc ) . Ella se separó de mí y me miro pícaramente -Esto es fuerte, veamos que puedes hacer, solo haz lo que dice la canción, bueno no literalmente, pero trata de convertir la letra en pasos de baile Este baile fue un poco raro. La letra quizás era sexista, ella dijo que mucho reggeaton solo tiene buen ritmo para bailar pero la letra era pésima y demigrante. Pero me divertí bailando esto. Dios, nunca pensé que bailar este ritmo me excitara tanto. Por suerte ella no se había dado cuenta que mi amigo se despertó. O quiero que piense que la quiero meter en mi cama, pero si quiero, pero no lo haré a menos que ella lo desee. Primero soy un caballero y más que todo quiero ser lo correcto con ella. Nos sentamos nuevamente en el sofá, la senté en mi regazo con cuidado de que no sintiera a mi inquieto amigo. La abrace y ella simplemente me besó apasionadamente. -¿y eso a que se debió? - A que disfrute mucho bailar contigo – beso – y merecías un premio por complacerme -Si me hubieras dicho que esta sería mi recompensa, hubiera bailado contigo así desde que te conocí – beso - Perdón si les interrumpo – nos giramos a ver nuestro inoportuno amigo – Hola Alex -Hola Eduardo -Hola – me saludo a mí - ¿podrías prestarme a tu novia para bailar? No quiero romper la tradición y ya pedí la pieza - Claro, si ella quiere - ella me mira con una sonrisa, aunque no quiero dejarla ir, le prometí portarme bien y nada celoso. Ella me besa y se va con él. La música que sonó si la conozco, recuerdo haberla escuchado en unas vacaciones en Rio de Janeiro. (Ai se eu te pego- Michel Telo www_youtube_com/watch?v=hcm55lU9knw ) , en verdad bailan muy bien ellos dos. La coreografía fue estupenda, y esa canción aunque suave se veía difícil de bailar, después de todo la zamba me han dicho que un ritmo muy difícil. Luego la canción cambio a una mucho más rápida (Balada Boa – Gustavo Lima www_youtube_com/watch?v=qvR_-sK8Now ) y en verdad se lucieron tanto que los demás se detuvieron para verlos bailar. Definitivamente ella parece profesional. Alguna vez me dijo que ella estuvo en una academia de baile, y por lo que veo la aprovecho muy ben. Nuevamente la música cambio a una más lenta: (Baile de Maosiña – Exporto Brasil www_youtube_com/watch?v=7asDETqXe6o ) , se movía de un lado al otro, muy difícil de describirlo, pero sus movimientos eran perfectos. Todos veían su coreografía y yo disfrutaba el movimiento de sus caderas embobado, sus brazos se alzaban hacia el techo y su cintura no paraba de balancearse. Dios, esta mujer me tiene idiotizado. -Ehhh ¿podemos hablar? – levanto mi mirada para ver a Darío, su mirada es seria, pero en mi fondo sabía que esto tenía que pasar, debía enfrentarlo, después de todo yo me entrometí en su vida. - Claro – le digo y él me hace señas con su cabeza indicándome que lo siguiera hacia afuera y lo sigo – Bien, iré directo al grano, puede pensar que estoy dolido, que quiero reclamarte por quitarme a mi chica pero no lo haré, solo quiero advertirte que no me daré por vencido – lo miro con rabia, quiero partirle esa cara de niño lindo que tiene pero él continua – no me interpondré entre ustedes, no haré nada para acabar su relación, simplemente seguiré siendo yo, seguiré estando a su lado, y seré paciente para cuando ella regrese a mí -¿Y qué te hace pensar que ella volverá contigo? -Vamos Josh, yo no sé por qué quieres hacerte el tonto, yo sé que solo quieres usarla, y aunque me duela dejaré que ella tome sus decisiones, y sé que cuando tú la decepciones, la abandones porque consigas lo que quieres o te canses de ella, o mucho mejor cuando ella se dé cuenta de que es a mí a quien en verdad necesita y ama. - Ella es mía, nunca la haría daño, entérate que en verdad la quiero y sé que ella a mí, así que te sugiero que dejes de hacerte falsas ilusiones – hago un gran esfuerzo por mantener la calma, no quiero que ella se enfade conmigo -Bueno como tú digas, me duele que ella vaya a sufrir por tu culpa, pero yo siempre estaré allí para ella, yo la amo y maldigo la hora en que apareciste, pero debo dejar que ella descubra las cosas por sí misma, pero estaré cuando ella necesite de mí para reparar su corazón. -Más te vale que te alejes de mi novia – lo agarro de la camisa - Tranquilo, no sé a qué le tienes miedo, si estas tan seguro de sus sentimientos, como te dije no haré nada para arruinar sus relación, el tiempo lo dirá todo, pero ella siempre me tendrá a mi como amigo, y cuando todo se termine será mi novia – se suelta de mi agarre y entra de nuevo en el salón. La verdad es que no sé qué responderle. Él tiene mucho que ganar, él ha estado con ella mucho tiempo y como ella mismo lo dijo fue o es el amor de su vida. No puedo evitar sentir inseguridad, yo la quiero pero pronto tendré que dejarla, tengo que volver a mi país, y él tendrá el camino libre. No quiero pensarlo, no quiero pensar que ella estará lejos de mí. Pero no me daré por vencido, si ella también me quiere lucharemos por nuestro amor. -¿En qué piensas? – pego un brinco del susto cuando Alex me abraza por detrás – Vaya, esa conciencia que tienes. -Casi me sale el corazón del susto -Soy espejo y me reflejo – contesta sonriente -¿qué? - Si te asustaste por que viste algo feo – dice señalando a su rostro – es porque te viste a ti mismo, soy un espejo - Jajaja, estaba con la mente en blanco, y no deberías decir eso, Ud. es hermosa – me giro tomándola del mentón – eres preciosa, las más linda del mundo. -Gracias por el cumplido señor adulador - No es un cumplido, es la verdad – le doy un beso fugaz, no quiero que me pregunte sobre lo que pensaba – Vamos adentro aun quiero bailar - Vamos – ella me lleva de la mano – empezó la hora loca y tienes que bailarla conmigo -¿la hora loca? -Una hora sin parar de bailar, donde se mezcla muchos éxitos bailables, desde zamba, lambada, electrónica, música de los 80 - Bueno, mientras no me hagas hacer el ridículo - Tranquilo – me besa, agarra mis manos y empieza a moverse y yo trato de seguir su ritmo Fue un baile completamente loco, había bailes simples hasta bailes que parecían que tenían coreografías establecidas como uno llamado el meneíto y la macarena. En bailes complicados como zamba ella se lucía y yo trataba de no quedar en ridículo, pero fue fantástico. Todos se organizaban para bailar al mismo tiempo. Hicimos una fila y corrimos por el salón, en verdad todos nos divertimos, aunque la mayoría eran extraños para mí, todos se trataban como grandes amigos. Luego de una hora de baile, todos nos caímos exhaustos en los sofás. Estábamos sudando y todos felices. Nunca había bailado así, con razón los latinos se los considera como personas alegres. Arturo nos anuncia que llego la hora del Karaoke. Es verdad, ella canta, la vi en unas fotos de su perfil Varios chicos cantaron muchas canciones, en inglés, en español, de todo tipo de género. Algunos muy bien, otros lo hacían mal, pero de los \"gallos\" que producían nos sacaban carcajadas a todos. -Aunque hoy no tenemos el dúo dinámico, por lo menos nos cantará Alex – todos rieron -Dale, ponme una romántica - dice Alex poniéndose de pie y dirigiéndose al escenario improvisado -Ok, quieres ir por lo sentimental, ya se cual ponerla, te sale muy bonita cuando la cantas -Dale – se sube al escenario y coge el micrófono – Chicos, yo sé que todos están animados, pero yo me voy por lo sentimental – escucho como chiflean, y la animan La canción empieza: (Por besarte - Lu www_youtube_com/watch?v=30yW5qfrrv0 ) , yo me siento en el sofá y me pierdo en su mirada, que está fija en mí. Puede que este enamorado, pero su voz es hermosa, nunca pensé que el amor pusiera tu mundo de patas arribas. Todo lo veo de mil colores, me pierdo en la realidad, parezco un niño entusiasmado, un adolescente descontrolado, todo por esta niña. Todos chiflean cuando acaba la canción y empiezan a gritar que cante otra. Ella se acerca a Arturo y le indica la nueva canción. Ella se acerca al micrófono -Bueno chicos, esta canción como la otra quiero dedicarla al niño que ha robado mi corazón – todos gritan \"Viiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\", - que molestosos, Josh, esto va para ti – me lanza un beso que yo simulo atrapar y poner mi mejilla por lo que todos me abuchean y ella empieza su canción: (Llegaste Tú – Jesse y Joy www_youtube_com/watch?v=XWgGYFqiCVM ) - ¿Qué te pareció? – me pregunta sentándose en mi regazo y besándome -Que eres maravillosa, ¿Hay algo que no puedas hacer? - Probablemente muchas cosas, pero por ahora quiero besarte – escuchamos que Darío empieza habla por el micrófono -Quiero dedicar esta canción a la niña de mis sueños, que aunque no esté conmigo. Yo siempre estaré para ella – siento como Alex se tensa y todas las miradas van a nosotros: (Nunca imagine - Tommy Torres www_youtube_com/watch?v=josjS2ORbtQ, esa canción me hizo sentir celoso, debía ser yo quien le cante algo así de bonito, y se que ella se siente mal por dejarlo, lo que hace a mi corazón retorcerse. Él en verdad la ama. Termina la canción y vuelve a hablar: -No quiero que te sientas mal, pero en verdad quiero que seas feliz, siempre estaré a tu lado – suena otra canción: (Suelta mi mano - Sin Bandera - www_youtube_com/watch?v=2LB370yjVNk ) , ella no deja de verlo, aunque me abraza sé que su mente está en él. Otra daga atraviesa mi corazón, como puedo haber estado tan feliz hace 10 minutos y ahora tan desolado. Quizás esta canción sea una despedida, o como dijo él, ella necesita vivir las cosas y solo es un hasta pronto. Sus ojos están vidriosos, lo que hace a mi alma y corazón se caiga a pedazos. Todos chiflean cuando termina. En verdad canto muy bien. Pero su mensaje fue directo. La mayoría sabe de quién habla. Pero no puedo evitar sentirme mal, sentir miedo porque ella lo amé y simplemente este conmigo porque yo la confundí. Ella nota mi rostro porque me besa dulcemente. Trato de sonreír, pero en verdad no creo que lo haya podido hacer. -Te quiero – me susurra en el oído – no lo olvides -Ahora quisiera pedirle a Alex que me acompañe en esta canción, ya que ambos estamos hoy románticos – él habla y ella me ve interrogativa, yo le hago una seña para alentarla, ella me besa y va hacia el escenario, ¿Qué puede pasar?. Ella toma el micrófono, y me mira cuando la canción empieza a sonar: ( A quien tú decidiste amar – Mario Sandoval www_youtube_com/watch?v=7jfEZHPt3iY ) Eso fue contra mí. El escogió esa canción para provocarme. Ella lo acompaño, pero se dio cuenta de lo que Darío pretendía. Cuando terminaron él se acercó a ella, la beso en la mejilla y creo que le susurro algo. Yo no podía aguantar más y salí de ahí. Necesitaba aire fresco. Era mi primer día de novio y mi corazón estaba sufriendo. Nunca he sentido desconfianza e inseguridad, pero este día me ha hecho vivir esos sentimientos y otros que nunca había experimentado, muchos de ellos malos. -Josh – su voz suena suave, en tono de disculpa - ¿Por qué te fuiste? ¿Por qué? Me lo pregunta, como cree que me siento viéndolos juntos, es frustrante no poder hacer nada, sentirte como el amor se va de tus manos, como la felicidad se va entre tus dedos como arena. ¿Porque?, ella está conmigo y no puedo evitar sentir que la pierdo a cada segundo -No podía presenciar su declaración de amor por ti – ella me toma del hombro y me gira -Josh, es nuestro primer día de novios y ya estamos haciéndonos daño – suspira – mejor dicho yo te hago daño, y el verte así me causa dolor a mí también La abrazo y ella me corresponde, aspiro su aroma, nunca podría cansarme de esto -Te quiero Alex, no quiero perderte -Ni yo – aflojo nuestro abrazo y la tomo del mentón, miro sus ojos y me hundo en sus labios, son mi refugio, son los que me quitan el sueño, los que me dan alegría, los que me quitan todas las inseguridades - Creo que será mejor que nos vayamos - ¿quieres despedirte? -No, solo quiero estar contigo – mi corazón empieza a vibrar, los pedazos se juntaron nuevamente para latir por ella Caminamos a su casa, abrazados, en silencio. No quería complicar las cosas, ella se sentía mal, pero está conmigo. Ella tuvo la oportunidad de dejarme pero no lo hizo, él estaba dispuesto a recibirla de regreso, pero me eligió. -Bien llegamos, ¿nos vemos el lunes? – ella dice con dudo, pero yo quiero verla mañana, no puedo esperar tanto para verla -¿Podemos vernos mañana? -No estoy segura, mañana mi familia vendrá a mi casa, y no creo poder salir contigo – ella aun no quiere presentarme a su familia aún, no debería sentirme mal, tiene razón es muy pronto -Ni siquiera un ratito – hago un puchero -Josh no hagas eso, a las 11h30 iré al estadio con mi hermano a ver a mi equipo a jugar futbol, ¿quieres ir? Solo puedo verte ese rato -Claro, quiero ir contigo, amo el futbol, ¿no tendrás ningún problema con tu hermano? -No como crees, eres mi novio y que mejor que conozcas a mi hermano. Al resto de mi familia la conocerás luego de un tiempo. Creo que es pronto aun. - SI tienes razón – la beso – estoy ansioso por verte mañana, mejor dicho más tarde porque ya son las 3 de la mañana. -Yo igual – acordamos donde encontrarnos, nos despedimos dándonos un apasionado beso obviamente. Llegue a mi casa y no podía dejar de pensar en todo lo de este día. Ahora ella es mi novia, y es lo único que necesito saber para decidirme a luchar y hacer que ella se enamoré de mí. Me duermo soñando en sus besos, en sus ojos, en sus caricias. En su forma de ser, en su personalidad, su alma, sus sentimientos. Ella es mía. Espero comentarios de q les esta pareciendo y en q creen q debo mejorar.. como les dije la historia kiero hacerlo de lo mas simple, como si fuera real... me mandaron un mns sobre si la pueden publicar en otras pag y claro q lo pueden hacer... y en cuanto a las canciones acepto sugerencia, he escuchado de todo tipo de musica tratando de encontrar las mejores letras :) ... 3 Milet[Chapter 20] Capítulo 20 La vida te pone cosas raras en el camino, hace menos de un mes estaba convencida de mi amor por Darío, ahora siento algo muy fuerte por Josh, no sé si deba llamarlo amor, pero lo quiero conmigo, lo necesito a mi lado, más de lo que me gusta admitir. Hoy le presentaré a mi hermano, por suerte Andrés es súper, buena gente y comprensivo. Sabrá guardarme el secreto. Me pongo la camiseta mi equipo, la gorra y unas gafas por qué hará sol. Partimos hasta el estadio de la ciudad. Caminamos unas cuadras de donde dejamos el auto. Espero que Josh ya esté aquí porque cuando se trata de futbol ni mi hermano ni yo nos gusta esperar o perdernos algo. -Ya entremos, dile a tu novio que nos vemos adentro – le conté a mi hermano quien era en realidad Josh, él no se sorprendió por al igual que yo fama y dinero no nos importa, y menos a él que del cine solo disfruta ver las películas. -Hola mi vida – Josh llega abrazándome por detrás justo cuando íbamos a ingresar al estadio -Estábamos por irnos – le dije haciéndole señas para que viera a mi hermano, él se separó rápidamente de mí sonrojado -Hola – le extendió su mano a Andres – Mucho gusto soy Josh, él ….. -Novio de mi hermana, ya lo sé – mi hermano sonrío – no tienes por qué sentirte incomodo, yo también tuve su edad y sé que les gusta andar de melosos, pero más te vale que no le hagas nada a mi hermana porque te buscare donde te escondas - Tranquilo, nunca sería capaz de hacer algo malo para ella -Eso espero, ahora vamos que no quiero que empiece el partido – nos apresuramos a ingresar, llegamos a una de las partes más altas donde podíamos apreciar toda la cancha. El partido empezó, mi hermano y yo nos concentramos. Fue un juego emocionante, muchas veces grite barbaridades al árbitro. Pero como siempre disfrute mucho. Cuando termino el primer periodo, Andrés fue a comprar unos Hot-Dogs; gire a ver Josh que estaba con una mirada un poco perdida -¿No te gusta el futbol? -No es eso – suspira – si me gusta, pero pensé que tendríamos tiempo para nosotros -Josh… es futbol, debes concentrarte en eso -Es que 45 minutos no hiciste más que pensar en eso, y yo aquí queriendo abrazarte, ni siquiera me lo permitiste - ¿Querías abrazarme? ¿Por qué no lo hiciste? -Lo intente, pero cada vez que estiraba mi brazo, tú te ponías de pie, brincabas, te movías de un lado a otro, así que mejor decidí ver el partido, aunque admito que fue bueno, quería estar contigo – dice haciendo un puchero que me produjo ternura - ¿no me digas que estas celoso? – dije riendo -No te burles, es difícil tener tu atención – sonrío – es tan raro sentir celos de algo en lugar de alguien -¿Sabes que eres ridículo? – No podía contener la risa, me acerque a él y lo bese – pero eres MI ridículo y te quiero muchísimo -Contigo todo es raro – me dice besándome de nuevo -¿Raro malo o raro bueno? -Raro fantástico – dice besando mi frente -Buena respuestas, pero para la próxima espero que veas el futbol y no quieras tener mi atención, porque perderás -Ya aprendí mi lección – me estrecha hacia él y yo coloco mi cabeza en su hombro – Nunca pensé conseguir una mujer que este obsesionada con el futbol - Cuando tenga hijos espero que alguno sea futbolista – solté mi comentario, cuando me di cuenta que no debía tocar ese tema aún, suele ser incómodo -No creo que eso sea posible, si alguno de tus hijos debe ser deportista tendrá que ser basquetbolista -¿y porque? – subió mis gafas colocándolas sobre mi cabello -Porque su papá le va a enseñar a jugar – dice con una gran sonrisa -¿Cómo sabes que su papa va a preferir el baloncesto al futbol?- no debí preguntar eso -Porque a su papá le encanta el baloncesto, y a mis pequeños también les gustara – besa mi frente y me sonrojo ante su mención de hijos entre los 2. Por suerte mi hermano volvió con 3 hot-dogs y colas y dejamos el tema Vimos el segundo periodo, yo me concentre como siempre pero trate de prestarle atención a Josh. Quien me abrazo, y discutimos varias jugadas. Luego de un rato el sacó su cámara de fotos. Me coloque mis gafas y mi gorra, tomamos una foto de ambos sacando la lengua y Andrés nos tomó una foto en la que yo lo besaba en la mejilla y él sonreía, detrás de nosotros se veía el partido de futbol. A pesar de que él está rodeado de fama y dinero, es muy humilde, disfruta de cosas pequeñas, es una persona real. Es difícil imaginarse que él vive en ese mundo donde cada persona se cree mejor que otra, es tan sencillo y lindo. Siento que cada día me enamoro más de este niño. No quiero pensar aun en lo difícil que será cuando todo esto acabe. Aunque nos despedimos hace 5 minutos, ya lo extraño. Pero no puedo hacer otra cosa, me encantaría pasar todo el día con él pero no es posible. Las reglas de la casa debo cumplirlas. Pero mañana saldremos juntos. Así pasamos toda la semana, salimos todos los días después de mis clases, algunas veces con Connor, nos divertimos mucho los 3. Mi mamá sospecha que ando con alguien, pero no dice nada. No quiero mentirle, pero sé que Josh pronto volverá a su antigua vida y cuando todo nuestro cuento de hadas termine no quiero que otros sepan nuestro secreto. A veces me hago ilusiones pensando en que nuestra relación durará, que atravesará distancias, y será perfecto. Pero la vida me ha enseñado que los cuentos de hadas no existen. -¿Sabes que eres la mujer más preciosa que he conocido? -Josh, me asustaste – suelto el aire y el me abraza por detrás - ¿Por qué tardaste tanto? -Perdóname tenía que preparar unas cosas – me besa la mejilla – Vamos, te tengo una sorpresa -¿Sorpresa? - No seas curiosa, ahora recógete el cabello que vendaré tus ojos -¿Estás loco? No vas hacer eso – la verdad me da miedo andar a ciegas – Además no sabes a donde ir, yo siempre manejo -Tranquila, lo planee todo, sé por dónde ir – coloca una venda en mis ojos – confía en mi – deposita un beso en mis labios Subí al auto, condujo por unos 15 minutos. No tengo idea de a dónde vamos, él no conoce mucho lugares, yo he sido su guía turística, pero veamos qué pasa. El auto se detiene y escucho como él se baja del auto. Abre mi puerta -Ya llegamos, baja con cuidado -Josh, odio estar a ciegas, siento que me voy a caer - el pasa un brazo por mis rodillas y el otro por mi espalda -Tranquila, conmigo siempre estarás segura – me besa en la mejilla -¿Sabes que eres cursi? – suelta carcajadas -Contigo no puedo evitarlo, ser cursi me es natural, así que más vale que te acostumbres porque tú no te quedas atrás cuando hablamos de cursilerías -Yo tampoco puedo evitarlo – le doy un palmazo en su cabeza -Oyeeee.. ¿Por qué me maltratas? Te denunciaré por maltrato -Estás loco Josh, además te lo mereces por convertirme en una adolescente cursi y enamorada -Si estoy loco – empieza a girar conmigo en brazos, yo me sujeto de su cuello- Loco por ti -Josh bájame – empiezo a gritar -No tengas miedo, nunca dejaría que te pase nada princesa – me baja con cuidado poniéndome sobre mis pies – Además ya llegamos, ¿estás lista? -Sip, apúrate que me desespero estar ciega -Que desesperada que eres – empieza a desatar mi venda –cierra los ojos -Dale, apúrate, odio la intriga – se coloca detrás y abraza mi cintura -Ábrelos – lo hago suavemente y me doy cuenta que estamos las afueras de la ciudad. Es un punto alto donde podemos apreciar toda la ciudad, es un lugar muy hermoso, no había venido aquí en años -Waooo ¿Cómo sabes de este lugar? -Mi abuelo me mostró, dijo que cuando vino a este lugar se dio cuenta que aquí quería vivir, es hermoso, pensé que me traerías aquí algún momento pero por suerte no lo hiciste y te traje yo -Hace mucho tiempo que no he venido, pero me alegra estar aquí contigo, es una muy linda sorpresa – beso su mejilla -Esa no es la sorpresa -¿ah no? – mete una mano en su bolsillo y saca un par de anillos de madera, debió comprarlos el día que visitamos un centro artesanal Toma mi mano y coloca el anillo en mi dedo anular sin romper la conexión de nuestras miradas – Ahora eres oficialmente mi novia No puedo dejar de sonreír ante su detalle – Pensé que ya lo era - ¿te gusto? -Pues claro que me gusto, es lo más hermoso que me han dado – digo mirando el anillo, veo que tiene una inscripción \"Siempre A y J\" – No tengo nada para ti – le digo tristemente -Tranquila, compre 2 anillos – me entrega el otro anillo, lo tomo y no dudo en ponérselo – eso está mejor, ahora somos oficialmente novios -Me encanto tu sorpresa Josh, contigo todo es perfecto - gotas de lluvia empiezan a caer tan repentinamente -Diablos, no planee que lloviera, vamos será mejor que entremos al auto no quiero que te enfermes -No te preocupes por mí, amo la lluvia – él sonríe y toma mis muñecas y las pasa tras su cuello, luego baja sus manos a mi cintura -Pues este momento es perfecto, no hay como un beso bajo la lluvia – las gotas caen más fuertemente, estamos empapados, el viento es fuerte y frío, pero no siento nada, no me importa nada, solo puedo sentir sus labios sobre los míos, enviado holeadas de calor, mi cuerpo se amolda al suyo, nuestros labios encajan como piezas de rompecabezas. Nuestro beso paso de ser tierno a tornarse pasional. Sus manos recorren mi espalda de arriba hacia abajo y yo profundizo más nuestro beso. No quiero soltarlo, lo necesito, necesito de él, de su calor, de sus besos. Estamos empapados y nuestras ropas se pegan al cuerpo. El posa sus manos en mis muslos y me levanta, yo me sujeto a su cintura con mis piernas, no rompemos el beso pero él nos lleva hacia el auto que está a unos 50 metros. No sé cómo llegamos a él, pero chocamos con la parte delantera. La intensidad de nuestro beso nos abruma, gracias a la lluvia, el suelo se vuelve resbaloso y Josh pierde el equilibrio y caemos en el lodo, yo encima de él. Dejamos de besarnos y nos quedamos viendo a los ojos. Las carcajadas no tardaron en aparecer -En verdad contigo pierdo el control – dice Josh con una sonrisa apenada -Jajaja te ves tan ridículo Hutcherson -Yo ridículo – dice con tono de indignación, con su mano embarra de barro mancha mi cara – ahora quien se ve ridícula? Agarro barro y se lo embarro en el rostro – Ahora estamos a mano – él se gira hasta yo quedar en el piso lodoso y el encima de mí -¿quieres jugar rudo señorita? - ataca mis labios y yo los recibo, empezamos a girar por el piso lleno de barro, abrazados, besándonos, una mezcla de barro y dulzura. La lluvia no paraba y yo estaba viviendo unos de los mejores momentos de mi vida. Pasamos horas bajo la lluvia. Por suerte nadie vino por este lugar, quizás por el clima. Nos encontrábamos recostados en el piso. El apoyado su espalda en un árbol, y yo con mi cabeza sobre su pecho. Las ramas y hojas nos cubrían un poco de la lluvia, pero seguíamos mojándonos, el viento soplando, llenos de lodo pero nuestra cercanía era suficiente para mantenernos en calor. El atardecer llego, y veíamos las luces de la ciudad encenderse de poco a poco. Algún día vendríamos y veríamos las estrellas, ahora el cielo esta nublado, pero eso no quita la belleza del momento. -Alex tengo que decirte algo – Josh rompe nuestro cómodo silencio. Su tono es de tristeza -¿qué sucede? – me apoyo en mi codo para mirarlo al rostro - El jueves tengo…. Que regresar a EEUU – me acomodo como estaba antes, no quiero que me vea llorar, lo bueno siempre dura poco, quizás ahora ya no lo vuelva a ver, él regresará a su vida y fácilmente se olvidara de mí – ¿no dices nada? -No tengo nada que decir – las lágrimas empujan en mis ojos por salir - Yo te voy a extrañar demasiado, a cada segundo tú serás el único de mis pensamientos – besa mi cabeza – te prometo volver apenas pueda, prometo llamarte todos los días, y quiero que nos pongamos de acuerdo en las horas que estemos disponibles para tener video llamadas, solo….. – Su voz se corta – no quiero que te alejes de mí, no quiero que la distancia nos impida querernos No quiero dañar el momento, quiero convencerme a mí misma de que nuestra relación seguirá a pesar de todo, no seré yo quien lo impida, si él en verdad quiere luchar, yo lucharé con él. -Josh, nada de lo que pase, ni cuán lejos estés, ni cuánto tiempo pase hará que mis sentimientos por ti cambien – es verdad, nada hará que cambien, la pregunta es si los misma sucederá con él - Si te pidiera que vengas conmigo no lo harás ¿verdad? - No Josh, no puedo hacerlo, esta es mi vida, no puedo dejarla ahora, además quiero graduarme, el otro ciclo ya tomare todas mis materias y será más pesado – suspiro aun mirando al horizonte – pero como tú dices podemos seguir con esto, todo a su tiempo pequeño – sigo tratando de convencerme más a mí que a él -Nunca te obligaré a nada Alex, pero si quieres estar conmigo, si quieres irte conmigo me harías la persona más feliz – besa mi cabeza y suelta un suspiro -Sabes que estos 2 días que nos quedan quiero aprovechar a lo máximo, aunque terminemos con un resfriado por andar en estas condiciones -Por suerte mi sistema inmunológico resiste mucho, pero será mejor que ya nos vayamos, quiero bañarme y lavar esta ropa antes de que lleguen mis papis a la casa – Josh hace un puchero – No me convencerá joven, además tengo que estudiar, mañana tengo un examen de Infectología -Bueno solo porque esa materia suena difícil – él se pone de pie y me sujeta de ambas manos para ayudarme a mí, el me tironea haciendo que me ponga de pie y me pegue su cuerpo, deposita mis manos detrás de su cuello y me besa -Eso tampoco me convencerá – le dijo sonriendo entre nuestros labios -Mal intento – me dice pícaramente - ¿y qué tal esto? – me besa nuevamente con más dulzura, sujeta mi labio inferior entre sus dientes provocándome un delicioso dolor -Ese fue un buen intento pero esta vez no me convencerás - Vale – me toma de la mano jalándome al auto – pero la próxima vez no te salvarás - No me retes Hutcherson, que soy capaz de dejarte un buen tiempo sin mis besos – le digo engreída -Olvida lo que dije, no quiero pasar por esa tortura por anticipado ¿que pasará cuando Josh regrese a EEUU? Su amor superará la distancia :)[Chapter 21] Capítulo 21 Deje a mi NOVIA en su casa, si por fin es mi novia oficialmente. Estoy tan feliz, contento, no lo sé, no creo que haya palabras para describirlo. Cuando llegue a casa seguramente traía una enorme sonrisa porque Connor y mis abuelos me molestaron con ello -Por Dios hijo, cuéntame la buena noticia, me estas matando de curiosidad, también quisiera saber que le paso a tu ropa – me pregunta mi abuela -Pues abuela – le paso un brazo por sus hombros – ya tienes una nueva nieta -¿no se suponía que ya eran novios Alex y tú? – pregunta mi hermano - Pues sí, ya lo éramos, pero hoy se lo pedí de la forma más correcta y ella lo acepto, pase la más maravillosa tarde de mi vida -Por la sonrisa que traes me imagino que estuvo genial – dice Connor mirándome de arriba abajo – y supongo que tu aspecto tiene que ver con eso, ¿no me digas que Alex te venció en luchas y te hizo caer en un charco de lodo? -Muy chistoso hermano, la verdad es que ambos terminamos con este aspecto – me rio recordando nuestros besos bajo la lluvia -Mejor no pregunto – dice mi abuelo abrazando a mi abuela – será mejor que vayas a tomar un baño y baja para cenar Subo a mi habitación, me meto a la ducha y me doy un largo baño. No me había dado cuenta el frío que sentía hasta que las gotas calientes cayeron en mi cuerpo prácticamente cocinándome. Cenamos en medio de risas, mis abuelos están felices por mi relación, ellos aman a mi novia, lo que me hace más feliz aun ¿Quién no amaría a esa niña? Como yo viajo el Jueves ellos no me acompañaran al aeropuerto de la capital, pero me propusieron que lo haga Alex, ellos ya han comprado los boletos de avión desde aquí hasta la capital. Cuando vine al país viaje en auto hasta aquí porque quería conocer este país, ahora ya no es necesario. Espero que Alex acepte. Además el jueves noche como despedida mis abuelos reservaron en un restaurante, donde prometí presentarles a Alex como mi novia, mi abuela es muy tradicional. -Josh, tu representante esta al teléfono – Connor grita desde la sala -Hola Steven ¿Cómo vas? -Josh, por fin logró contactarte, ¿Dónde te has metido? -Lo lamento, prometí llamarte pero he estado ocupado, además el viernes estaré por allá -¿ocupado? Me imagino que con tu nueva novia – dice Steven con un tono de ironía- Josh tenía que decirte que con lo de tu relación tu popularidad se ha elevado por los cielos, y más con la incógnita de su identidad -¿En verdad? No me lo esperaba -Josh, es la mejor jugada que has hecho, llamaba para decirte lo que debes hacer ahora -¿lo que debo hacer?- no entiendo a dónde quiere llegar con esto -Ahora debes darla a conocer al mundo, debes decir donde te encuentras, quien es ella y lo loco de amor que estas por esa niña - No estoy muy seguro de eso Steven -Josh, soy tu manager, publicista, hazme caso, además eso será bueno para ella, tú sabes que si ganan como pareja del año hay un gran cheque detrás de eso, estoy seguro que ella estará feliz por ese dinero -No lo sé Steven, no quiero comprometer nuestra relación, ya de por si es un poco difícil, por la distancia y todo eso... – me interrumpe -Por lo mismo Josh, ella es mujer y seguro está insegura de que tú la quieres y que mejor forma de mostrarle tu amor haciendo que el mundo se entere de quien es la chica que te trae loco- después de meditarlo creo que es una buena idea, Steven me explica lo que debo hacer, eso incluye usar las redes sociales, publicar fotos nuestras y una pequeña emboscada de a prensa en el aeropuerto de este país cuando este por volver. Alex me dijo que estaba sin internet durante toda esta semana, así que le hice caso a Steven y empecé a subir fotos nuestras en la red, Facebook y twitter iban a estallar. Veía noticias de mí por todo lado \"Josh Hutcherson y Su Nuevo Romance, por fin tenemos un rostro\", gracias a que ella no era famosa aun no la identificaban y tampoco daban con mi ubicación. Espero que lo que estoy haciendo no me ponga en problemas, decido llamarla para ver que haremos mañana, solo nos quedan 2 días juntos y quiero aprovecharlos al máximo. -Si bueno? – la voz de una mujer me contesta, tuve que llamar al teléfono de su casa porque su celular me enviaba a buzón -Buenas noches, podría hablar con Alexandra – pregunto nervioso, estoy hablando con mi suegra, espero que no se enoje con ella, que no sea de esas madres celosas -Un momento por favor, ya se la paso – escucho como le llama para que conteste -Si bueno? – me contesta muy educadamente -¿Cómo está la señorita más linda del mundo? - Josh, ¿Cómo así me llamas a este teléfono? -Lamento si te cause problemas, pero tu celular me enviaba a buzón -¿En verdad? Déjame ver – escucho como se mueve – Diablos, ya entiendo, mi celular acaba de morir -¿Qué pasó? -Pues digamos que mi bebé compartió con nosotros la experiencia de la tarde, ni modo tendré que ver como consigo otro, por lo menos que me sirva para llamadas, por suerte tenia todos los archivos en mi computador – aunque suena triste eso me da una gran idea -Lo lamento mucho mi vida, todo es mi culpa -Tranquilo, no es tu culpa, pero no gano nada lamentándome, mejor dime ¿a qué debo tu llamada? -Pues quería escuchar tu voz, sabes últimamente eres mi propia marca de heroína -No sé si sentirme halagada o asustada por tu comentario -Solo espero que no me tengas miedo, porque si tratas de alejarme me comportaré como un adicto con síndrome de dependencia buscando la fuente de mi necesidad -¿desde cuándo sabes sobre síndromes? -Cada palabra que sale de tu boca es captada por todo mi cuerpo, así que si termino hablando en términos médicos es tu culpa- escucho como suelta una carcajada- la verdad quería ver que íbamos a hacer mañana para pasar el día -Olvide decirte sobre eso- suelta un suspiro – mañana tengo clases en la mañana y en la tarde me ofrecí a cuidar a mis sobrinas (las hijas de su prima), creo que no podremos vernos -Por favor, podemos llevarlas con nosotros, además muero por conocerlas en persona, me has hablado tanto de ellas que me siento como si fuera su padre -¿No te molestaría llevarlas? -Claro que no, quiero conocerlas, quiero conocer todo lo que te rodea, además amo a los niños, mañana pasaré por ti a las 2pm -Estaré lista, gracias Josh -¿Por qué me agradeces? -Por ser tan especial, te quiero mucho, no lo olvides -Yo igual, no tienes nada que agradecerme - quiero saber si sabe de qué nuestras fotos están colgadas en la red - ¿te conectarás al chat? -No recuerdas que te dije que estaba sin internet hasta el viernes – suelto el aire cómo un gran suspiro de alivio – Bueno Josh, amo hablar contigo pero debo irme a dormir, planeo madrugar a estudiar, nos vemos mañana pequeño, sueña con los angelitos -Claro que lo haré, tú seguramente estarás en mis sueños, te quiero princesa, espero que sueñes conmigo -Puede ser, no controlo lo que sueño ¿sabes? -Amo cuando dices cosas para llevarme la contra, duerme bien Alex Al día siguiente tuve que salir de compras, quería impresionar a las pequeñas, les compre un peluche a cada una con forma de conejito muy tierno, además debía comprarle un regalo a mi novia. Le compre el celular más avanzado que encontré, le habría contratado un paquete de internet y pagado por un año de adelanto, así podríamos estar en contacto a cada momento. Guarde todas nuestras fotografías, video en él. Se lo daría antes de partir, espero que aún no haya visto que hice pública nuestros recuerdos. Pasamos toda la tarde con las pequeñas, la mayor tiene 4 años, se llama Victoria y las mellizas tiene 2 años, se llaman Emily y Renata, son unas pequeñas diablillas, muy preciosas. Fuimos a un parque donde ellas podrían jugar y nosotros controlábamos que no hicieran daño. La devoción que Alex les tenía a esas niñas era como las de una auténtica madre, en un futuro estoy seguro que ella desempeñará un papel maternal fenomenal. Espero que sus hijos también sean míos, aunque pensar en esas cosas es demasiado pronto debo admitir que la idea me ilusiona. La tarde se nos fue volando y llego mi último día en este país, lamentablemente Alex tenia clases todo el día, así que la vería en la noche cuando vayamos a la cena con mis abuelos. Es una cena de gala, mis abuelos reservaron en un restaurante muy elegante, como despedida para mí y mi hermano. Pareciera que el tiempo transcurría de la forma más lenta, deseaba verla, me moría por estrecharla entre mis brazos. Diablos, quería besarla, me he vuelto un adicto a su esencia. Quiero verla arreglada, recuerdo la última vez que la vi con ropa elegante, lamentablemente esa noche arruine todo tratando de propasarme, pero quien me culparía por llenarme de lujuria si tenía esa preciosidad frente a mí. Cuando por fin llegue la hora, tome el auto de mi abuelo y fui a buscarla. Mis abuelos y Connor tomarán un taxi y nos esperaran en el restaurante. Espero 10 minutos fuera de su casa cuando por fin salió. Mi mandíbula prácticamente cayó al suelo. Estaba preciosa, su vestido era de color violeta, sencillo, como siempre, un poco ajustado en su busto y holgado el resto, caía ajustando a su cuerpo de una forma delicada, llegando hasta sus rodillas. Su cabello estaba lleno de sus rizos, caían enmarcando su rostro, de una forma muy ordenada, no como sus típicos rizos alborotados. Su maquillaje era muy sutil, y sus ojos se veían más grandes que nunca. Era sencillamente hermosa. Me acerque a ella, su timidez salió a flote, de seguro estaba nerviosa -¿te gusta? No le di tiempo a responder, le tome de la cintura y cerré el espacio entre nuestros labios. Necesitaba la sensación que estos momentos me regalaban. No quería sepárame, pero la falta de aire se hizo presente -Supongo que si te gusto -¿es en serio? Ni la luna ni las estrellas brilla como tú – acaricio su mejilla – eres hermosa -De tanto que lo dices me lo terminaré creyendo -Pues no deberías dudarlo, eres las más hermosa de todas – le doy otro beso fugaz – será mejor que nos vayamos, antes de que me lleguen los malos pensamientos -Eres terrible Josh – abro la puerta del auto para que pueda subir. Llegamos al restaurant, la tomo de la mano y siento que está nerviosa -Vamos Alex, ¿Por qué los nervios? Ya conoces a mis abuelos -Pero ahora somos novios, es diferente -Ellos te adoran, y ahora te van a querer más – beso su frente – lo más probable es que mi abuela te llamará \"nieta\" desde ahora Dejamos nuestros abrigos en la entrada, con nuestros dedos entrelazados nos dirigimos a la mesa donde nos esperaban Connor y mis abuelos. Todos estaban felices de que seamos novios, la cena fue muy divertida, Alex sabe cómo ganarse a la gente con su forma de ser, siempre tan sencilla, espontanea. Me perdí toda la noche en sus ojos, no podía evitar verla tan entusiasmada, su sonrisa hacía que mi corazón quiera salirse del pecho. Creo que esto es amor, sin duda, es algo nuevo para mí, pero sin duda es lo más fuerte que he sentido. -Basta Josh, vas a desgastar a tu novia de tanto mirarla – Connor y sus comentarios, que me hicieron sonrojar -No puedo evitarlo – levanto lo hombros – si mi novia luce tan hermosa -Amor juvenil, es hermoso – dice mi abuela tomando la mano de mi abuelo -Bueno es hora de que lleve a mi novia a su casa, no quiero que mis suegros se enojen por ser muy tarde – veo como Alex me mira con intriga, ella puede llegar a la hora que desee pero yo quiero un tiempo a solas con ella -Bueno Alex, nos seguiremos viendo, espero que nos visites a pesar de Josh no este -Claro que sí, los visitaré y muchas gracias por los boletos de avión, en verdad estoy feliz por poder acompañar a Josh lo más que puedo -Es lo menos que podemos hacer por hacer a mi nieto tan feliz, además serás excusa para que nos visite más seguido – mi abuela se despide con un beso de mi novia -Ten por seguro que lo haré – me despido con la mano y salimos del restaurante -¿Puedes explicarme eso de que tengo que llegar pronto a mi casa? -Lo siento, quería una excusa para sacarnos de ahí – la tomo con ambas manos de la cara y la beso – quiero aprovechar cada minuto contigo -Es una buena excusa, cursi pero buena- ella me besa - ¿y que tiene planeado hacer señor Hutcherson? -Nada en especial, solo quiero ver el cielo estrellado -En verdad eso suena cursi – suelta una sonrisa – pero se dónde podemos disfrutarlo Nos subimos en el auto y ella se puso detrás del volante. Luego de 15 minutos estábamos en la autopista saliendo de la ciudad -La próxima vez que vengas te llevare a conocer sitios fuera de la ciudad -Eso sería perfecto, por cierto ¿A dónde vamos? -Querías ver la estrellas, pues necesitamos ir a un sitio donde no haya luces – luego de unos minutos ella toma un desvío por un camino de tierra, un poco lleno de baches donde al parecer no vive nadie. Todo está muy silencioso, los arboles no rodean. Ella para el auto y se baja antes de que yo le pregunte algo. -¿Qué te parece? – miro al cielo y en verdad me sorprendo de lo que veo. Las estrellas y la luna brillan con tal intensidad que puedo divisar el pequeño sendero a nuestro lado que va hacia un pequeño río donde la luz se refleja. Un paisaje muy hermoso – encontré este lugar una vez que decidí aventurarme por nuevo rumbos, a veces vengo a pensar, es mi escondite -Es en verdad precioso – me acerco a ella por detrás, abrazo su cintura y color mi mentón en su hombro – gracias por mostrarte tu sitio secreto -Solo contigo lo compartiría -¿Ahora quién es la cursi? – suelta una carcajada – amo que me digas cosas como esas – beso el lóbulo de su oreja por lo que la siento estremecerse -Estaba siguiéndote la corriente Nos sentamos a orillas del pequeño río, me apoye en un árbol y ella se recostó en mi pecho de espaldas entre mis piernas, nos cubrí a ambos con nuestros abrigos. No se cuánto tiempo estuvimos cayados, pero no era un silencio incomodo, todo lo contrario, disfrutábamos de nuestro contacto, de los sonidos que emitían los animales y el rio junto a nosotros. Nunca pensé que disfrutara tanto del silencio. -Sabes que no cambiaría este momento por nada en el mundo, no recuerdo haberme sentido más dichoso alguna vez -¿en serio? – ella se gira para quedar frente a mí -Nunca sería capaz de mentirte, quiero que esto dure por siempre – veo su mirada llena de tristeza – espero que cuando me vaya no te olvides de mí, porque yo no podre apartarte de mi mente ni un solo minuto -Sabes que eso es mentira – su mirada se llena de rabia – me olvidaras, lo sé, te olvidaras de todo esto, por favor Josh, déjame disfrutar lo poco que me queda -¿Qué? Alex no, ¿Cómo puedes pensar así? – Suelto un suspiro resignado - ¿en verdad crees que eres solo una distracción para mí?¿en verdad crees que solo te estoy usando por un rato? -No quiero pensar eso, pero es difícil de creer todo lo que me dices – ella se levanta y camina hacia la orilla del río, no dudo en seguirla. Le tomo del brazo para que me miré, por sus ojos se derraman lágrimas –Es difícil pensar que alguien como tú me quiera -¿alguien como yo? – pregunto irritado -Sabes a lo que me refiero, alguien como tú, alguien que lo tiene todo, fama, dinero, éxito, tienes millones de chicas muy hermosas detrás de ti, chicas bellas, personas iguales a ti -Pues no quiero a ninguna de ellas, te quiero a ti – paso mi mano por mi cabello – Alex por favor, deja de menospreciarte, eres la persona más especial que he conocido en mi vida, eres dulce, eres generosa, hermosa, compasiva, luchadora, podría nombra miles de virtudes más, lo único que importa aquí es que te necesito a mi lado y necesito que dejes esa desconfianza, te hace mal, me hace mal… no se la razones porque eres tan insegura cuando se trata de ti Me siento frustrado, no quiero que su inseguridad nos afecte, pero ella tiene que abrir los ojos y darse cuenta lo valiosa que es. Sus lágrimas se derraman a chorros, lo único que puedo hacer es abrazarla. Siento sus sollozos en mi pecho. Me siento culpable por hacerla sentirse de esta manera. -Lamento mucho haberte dicho esto – le digo cuando está más calmada – necesitas saber cuan valiosa eres, pero no debí ser grosero -No fuiste grosero, fuiste sincero, perdóname a mí por desconfiar de ti -No perdóname, es lógico que sientas ese tipo de desconfianza, solo no te enojes conmigo, no quiero separarme de ti con la idea de que me odias -No te odio Josh, no podría hacerlo – la estrecho más fuerte -Olvidemos todo esto – tomo su mentón y la obligo a mirarme – no quiero verte así, eres lo más valioso que tengo, nunca estaría dispuesto a perderte Su beso me toma desprevenido, siento su necesidad de sentirse segura, siento el sabor de sus lágrimas y me siento culpable por que se sienta de esa manera. Gracias al cielo pudimos cambiar de tema, y el resto de la velada fue preciosa. En medio de besos y juegos el tiempo se había ido volando. La lleve a su casa sin antes repetirle cuanto la quiero, cuanto la extrañare. Mañana será el día de nuestro \"hasta pronto\", sé que no podre evitar las lágrimas. Por primera vez en mi vida me siento vulnerable. Ella no es la única con inseguridades, yo también tengo miedo de que cuando este lejos ella se olvide de mí y regrese con Darío. Lo único que puedo es conservar la esperanza de que eso no suceda. Yo sé que ella me quiere y que yo la amo, no dudaré en hacérselo saber. HOLA ... solo kiero decir que acepto sugerencias de canciones para mas adelante :) es facil enconrar musica q josh puede dedicar, pero es dificil encontrar canciones que Alex le dedique :) cada vez esta mas cerca el ADIOS... ahora les dejo un adelanto :) Bajamos del avión y siento que Josh se tensa un poco. Luego de pasar por revisión y dejar las maletas de Josh, el sugiere que almorcemos antes de ir a la sala de espera. Apenas bajamos las gradas para dirigirnos a la ZONA DE ALIMENTOS y noto los muchos fotógrafos, fans con carteles de Josh. Los flashes no me dejaban ver. Mire a Josh y él se vía tenso, pero siento que él ya se lo esperaba. -¿Qué está pasando? – sé que mi pregunta es estúpida pero me siento frustrada -Lo lamento, esto siempre me sucede – lo dice con tristeza, pero siento que no está siendo sincero en algo. El me sujeta de la mano y me jala hacia un restaurante atravesando el muro de fotógrafos y fans que se han formado. ¿Se enterara Alex q Josh la esta usando para aumentar su fama? -Milet 3[Chapter 22] Capítulo 22 Me levanto rápidamente, me meto y tomo una ducha a prisa. Busco un conjunto ligero, debido que en la capital el clima es cálido a diferencia de aquí que es más frío. Luego de vestirme, desayunar, arreglarme el cabello dejándome mis rizos, claro aplicando millonadas de gel, y maquillarme estoy litas para quizás uno de los días más triste de mi vida. De verdad lo extrañaré, esta vida y la otra. No quiero que se vaya, pero entiendo que su vida no es aquí. Quizá si todo va bien entre nosotros tendremos la oportunidad de estar juntos todo el tiempo que necesitemos, pero ahora no es de esa manera y yo simplemente tengo que fingir que estoy feliz para no echarme a llorar en sus brazos. Me he vuelto débil, no se la razón pero cuando estoy con él toda mi protección, todas mis defensas se deshacen, y me encuentro débil. Veo por mi ventana que ya se encuentra esperando fuera de mi casa. Me despido de mi padres diciendo que voy a acompañar a un amigo a el aeropuerto, peo no le dije de que ciudad. Espero que no se enteren, aún no saben que tengo novio y mucho menos de quien se trata, prefiero tenerlo en secreto hasta ver que sucederá. -Hola Connor, Hola Josh, perdón la tardanza no encontraba mis gafas – subí al auto, no siquiera logre ponerme el cinturón de seguridad cuando Josh me tomo por los hombros y me beso. Aunque me tomo por sorpresa ese beso también lo necesitaba. -Ya basta, ustedes acabaran con mi inocencia – Josh y yo nos separamos y no reimos del comentario de Connor -Dudo que tengas inocencia luego de verte con tu exnovia – suelta Josh, recuerdo que me comento que al ex de Connor era una chica que a pesar de su edad era muy lanzada, se lo comía a besos y según Josh desvestía a Connor en cada abrazo -Esa es otra historia, si ustedes quieren voy a comprar un regalo y les doy tiempo para un rapidito -Connor – gritamos Josh y yo al unísono, mis mejillas en verdad ardían - Ok ok lo siento, tranquila Alex – dice riéndose – además dudo que mi hermano avance a hacerlo -Cállate Connor – Josh lo reprende pero puedo ver que tiene una sonrisa reprimida -Ok OK yo solo ofrecía mi ayuda, par de malagradecidos Llegamos al aeropuerto y estacionamos el auto. Al regreso yo tendré que ir a dejarlo en casa de sus abuelos. Subimos al avión, me coloque junto a la ventana y Josh me abrazó. -Sabes tengo un regalo para ti -¿Un regalo? ¿En serio? -Sip – se levanta para tomar su bolso del compartimento sobre nosotros – Espero que te guste – me da un paquete, lo abro y me encuentro con una Tablet -Josh, no debiste haber gastado en esto -¿no te gusta? -Claro que me gusta, pero es un gasto innecesario -¿Cómo que innecesario? Por mi culpa tu celular se dañó, además ahora podremos tener videoconferencias en cualquier momento, viene con internet incluido – no me gusta que gaste su dinero en mí, me molesto siempre que me compra este tipo de cosas, perfumes, peluches, todos son muy bonitos peor me hacen sentir incomoda – por favor, acéptalo, prometo no volver a gastar en más cosas si quieres, pero necesito estar seguro de que podremos estar en contacto -Está bien – digo rendida – pero tendrás que cumplir tu promesa de no gastar tu dinero en mí -No entiendo porque te molestas, es solo dinero, y es fabuloso comprarte cosas -Pero a mí no me gusta, por favor Josh -Ok no lo discutiré – besa mi mejilla – gracias por aceptarlo, por cierto, ahí guarde todas las fotos que tenemos juntos, incluyendo las de Denver y el comercial, que aún no lo has visto -es verdad, ahora lo veré... Por cierto solo acepto porque yo también tengo algo para ti – me mira interrogante, por lo que saco de mi bolso una USB y la pongo en sus manos -¿y esto que tiene? -Bueno tu pediste conocer más sobre la música que escucho, ahí guarde toda la música del computador y también listas de reproducción de lo que más escucho – él sonríe – también guarde todos mis libros favoritos -Gracias, eso es fantástico En menos de una hora estábamos aterrizando. Miro mi reloj apenas son las 10h30am y el vuelo de Josh sale a la 1pm. Bajamos del avión y siento que Josh se tensa un poco. Luego de pasar por revisión y dejar las maletas de Josh, él sugiere que almorcemos antes de ir a la sala de espera. Apenas bajamos las gradas para dirigirnos a la ZONA DE ALIMENTOS y noto los muchos fotógrafos, fans con carteles de Josh. Los flashes no me dejaban ver. Miro a Josh y él se vía tenso, pero siento que él ya se lo esperaba. -¿Qué está pasando? – sé que mi pregunta es estúpida pero me siento frustrada -Lo lamento, esto siempre me sucede – lo dice con tristeza, pero siento que no está siendo sincero en algo. El me sujeta de la mano y me jala hacia un restaurante atravesando el muro de fotógrafos y fans que se han formado. Gracias a seguridad del aeropuerto logramos entrar a un restaurante donde no permitieron entrar a la audiencia que esperaba a Josh. Aun así las personas que se encontraban en el restaurante se acercaron a pedir fotos y autógrafos. -Tu vida es dura, no sé cómo soportas eso – señalo cuando nos traen la comida y Connor fue hacia el baño -Perdóname pequeña – Josh se acerca a mí intentando besarme y yo lo aparto con la mano, puedo ver que se releja tristeza en su mirada -No puedo, no con tanta gente mirándonos a través de los cristales – tomo un sorbo de mi jugo -¿te avergüenzas de mí? – pregunta Josh mirando al suelo -Oh por Dios, No Josh, ¿Cómo podría hacerlo? – Me acerco a él – solo que no estoy acostumbrada a tanta atención, es raro algo nuevo para mí, entiéndeme -Lo siento, siento hacerte pasar por esto, pero es inevitable, te entenderé si no quieres tener nada conmigo -Josh no seas dramático – tomo de su mentón para que me mire, aunque siento los flashes de las cámaras a mis espaldas – Esto no hace que te quiera menos -¿En verdad no estás disgustada? -Si estoy disgustada pero no contigo, es algo que no se puede evitar – le doy un fugaz beso que de seguro aparecerá en revistas -Lo estarás cuando sepas que yo ocasione esto – me quedo en silencio sin entender lo que me quiere decir – yo publique un twitter diciendo que extrañaría a mi novia, y que dejo mi corazón en este país, porque hoy regresaría -Mierda Josh, ¿Por qué? -Perdóname, no lo podía resistir, tenía que mostrar al mundo lo feliz que estaba de tenerte, perdóname si -Bueno que se le puede hacer, tarde o temprano se enterarían, además el lado bueno es que podre decir que eres mi novio sin tener que preocuparme por ocultarnos -Amo cuando buscas el lado bueno de las cosas – me da un fugaz beso -Eso no quita que este molesta contigo Hutcherson Es difícil poder comer cuando sobre ti hay gente y cámaras viendo cada movimiento. Luego de un rato un guardia permite que ingrese un periodista, para poder apaciguar a la gente que ansía con ver a Josh. Insiste que de una pequeña rueda de prensa, todos están intrigados por nuestro romance y la estancia en el país. Josh me pide que acceda y no puedo negarme. Dar una declaración a la prensa no complicará más las cosas de las que ya están. Estoy segura que hoy tendré una charla de sexo de mis padres. Nos dirigen a una sala de prensa en el aeropuerto donde han acomodado todo para las entrevistas. -Josh, por favor háblanos de su romance, todos estamos intrigados de saber cómo se conocieron – el primer periodista hace la pregunta que al parecer todos esperaban, espero que Josh responda sin revelar mucho de nuestra historia -Buenos días a todos, en verdad me ha gustado mucho este país, así que me tendrán por aquí muy próximamente, aprovecho para presentar a mi novia Alexandra – me besa en la mejilla – la verdad no puedo decirles como nos conocimos porque ese es un secreto que nos gusta conservar – todos aluden un \"AWWW\" de simpatía por nosotros – pero lo único que puedo decirles es que agradezco a la vida por ponerla en mi camino Así hay muchas preguntas, que gracias a cielo tratan también de sus nuevas películas, sobre el turismo en este país debido a que Josh les dio a entender que no daría mucha información sobre nuestro noviazgo. Al final Josh les agradece a todos, y muy a mi pesar me besa frente a las cámaras, yo le correspondo no muy contenta, pero tampoco puedo dejarlo mal frente a todos. Logramos llegar a la sala de espera donde en el vuelo de Josh empieza a ingresar los pasajeros. Llego el momento. -Perdóname por esto, espero que no te enojes por lo que la fama puede ocasionar a tu vida, no sabes lo culpable que me siento -No te preocupes, es mejor aprender a vivir con eso, creo – lo abrazo, el hunde su nariz en mi cabello y yo mi rostro en su cuello, no puedo evitar que las lágrimas broten – te voy a extrañar más de lo que te imaginas - y yo a ti, no sé cómo podré estar sin ti, cada segundo será eterno – besa mi cabeza – pero vamos a tener que organizarnos para hablar por lo menos una vez al día -Es verdad, pero igual no será lo mismo – él toma mi rostro y limpia mis lágrima con sus pulgares, veo que sus ojos también retienen lágrimas lo que me asegura que él también me extrañará Anuncian la última llamada para su vuelo. Así que luego de darme un largo beso y de separarse de mí camina hacia el túnel de abordaje. Me despido de Connor y el aborda. Josh se alea de mí, despidiéndose con su mano y justo cuando están por cerrar la puerta del túnel, el deja su bolso y corre hacia mí. Me levanta por los aires y me besa dulcemente. Parece una escena de película, pero para mí es el momento perfecto. -Tenía que hacerlo, necesitaba un beso más, te quiero -Y yo a ti – me da un beso fugaz y ahora si se aleja, nuestras dedos se separan y siento que mi corazón se va con él. Entra en el tunel de abordaje y miro como su avión despega. 10 minutos después subo en mi avión. Miro el regalo de Josh y reviso todas las fotos que nos tomamos, momentos felices que me hacen sonreír. Se supone que no es un a \"hasta siempre\", sino un \"hasta pronto\", pero es difícil evitar pensar que se acabó. Llego a mi ciudad, llevo el auto a la casa de los abuelos de Josh, por suerte no se encuentran, no soportaría que me pregunten por la despedida. Cuando llego a mi casa, como lo esperaba mi mamá me vio en TV, y recibí la charla de la confianza. Ellos siempre quieren que les presente a mis amigos y novios. Por suerte entendieron que no podía hacerlo hasta estar segura de nuestra relación. Pero les prometí que en un próximo viaje de Josh (si volvía) se los presentaría. Me duermo soñando en esos ojos marrones que me vuelven loca, deseando volver a tenerlo a mi lado, deseando que me quiera como yo a él….. Un nuevo capítulo, trataré de actualizar mas seguido... la verdad solo lo tengo escrito hasta el capítulo 31.. porque algunas veces escribo capítulos que iran mucho mas adelante... lo hago antes de que se vayan mi ideas :) -Espero que escuchen la música de cada capítulo.. he tratado de seleccionar las letras mas emotivas, y q me han gustado... me ha costado encontrar música en ingles xq es lo mas justo, cada uno vienen de un mundo diferente, diferente comida, costumbre, idioma... uds m entienden..! Avance: -\"¿Josh por qué lo hiciste? ¡!\" -\"Hola mi vida, ¿cómo te fue? A mi muy bien, extrañándote, aun cansado del viaje, pero con muchas ganas de saber de ti\" -\"No me vengas con eso Joshua Ryan Hutcherson, responde mi pregunta ahoraaaa\" -\"No pensé que te molestara, además todo mundo ya lo sabe, no tiene nada de malo\" -\"Tienes razón, gracias a ti todo mundo lo sabe, pero lo hiciste sin consultarme eso es lo que me enoja \" ¿que fue lo que hizo Josh? ¿se sabrá las cosas malas que encierran su relación?[Chapter 23] Capítulo 23 He viajado por horas, pero sin embargo no he podido dormir. No puedo dejar de recordar cada momento que viví con ella, no puedo evitar extrañarla. Me siento como un adolescente enamorado, es tan raro vivir estas emociones, pensé haber estado enamorado otras veces, pero comparado a lo que siento ahora sé que no fue así. Es raro cuando te acostumbras a tener chicas que se ofrecen para que les complazcas sexualmente, uno disfruta de esos placeres pero con ella todo es diferente. Solo con mirarla, con besarla siento más placer de lo que en toda mi vida he sentido. No puedo imaginarme lo que sería hacerle el amor. Sé que ella tiene dudas sobre ello. Un día que llegamos a ese tema, me confeso que era virgen. Cosa que me sorprendió, no porque crea que ella se acuesta con cualquier persona, sino porque ella ha tenido mucho pretendientes, y según me conto 2 veces ella tuvo novios a los que \"quería\", uno de esos era Darío, yo en verdad pensé que ellos 2 habían tenido sexo. Pero para mí buena suerte no había sido así, lo que me hace sentir realmente feliz, ser él único hombre para ella, él único a quien ella se entregaría, a quien amará. Quizás es machista, pero n puedo dejar de estar orgulloso y ansioso por ser ese hombre. Quiero tenerla entre mis brazos, besarla por todo su cuerpo, escucharla gritar mi nombre y alcanzar juntos el clímax. Creo que no pasará pronto, y tampoco quiero obligarla, aunque ella trate al sexo como algo normal, sé que aún no quiere tenerlo, quizás porque tuvo una mala experiencia, no lo sé, pero quiero ganarme esa confianza para poder preguntarle. Llegamos a EEUU, tengo que pasar por mi departamento en Los Ángeles, hablar con Steven y luego viajaré para las regrabaciones de una película en la que estoy trabajando. El bendito tráfico nos ha detenido, mis manos sudan por la impaciencia, y el taxi no avanza -Tranquilo hermano, ya vamos a llegar para que puedas ir al baño -Estúpido, necesito llegar para comunicarme a Alex, a esta hora ella ya debió llegar a su casa de clases – la verdad necesito saber de ella, saber que no se olvidó de mí, sé que soy obsesivo solo han pasado una hora pero siento como si fuera una eternidad -Dios, en verdad tienes madera de acosador, hermano – suelta carcajadas – pobre de ella, tener que aguantar tus arranques posesivos -Tus bromas cada vez me gustan menos -Vamos deja de ser amargado – me da un golpe en mi brazo – ella te quiere, no tienes por qué dudarlo -La extraño -La veras muy pronto, hablaras con ella a diario, si en verdad se quieren, como pienso que lo hacen, todo estará bien Llegue a mi departamento, lo primero que hice fue encender el computador. La busque conectada a Facebook pero no la encontré. Quizás ya estaría durmiendo, será mejor que espera hasta mañana para hablar con ella, no quiero que piense que soy un acosador obsesivo. Miro la red llena de noticas sobre nuestra relación, en menos de 24 horas ya han hecho un especial sobre su vida, su infancia, sus estudios hasta sus novios. Ni yo sabía de tantas cosas que se encuentra aquí, en verdad espero que todo esto no interfiera entre nosotros. Miro su muro y encuentro una foto de ella, Santiago, Fernanda, Darío y otros chicos comiendo pizza. La foto fue tomada hace 5 minutos, ahora se la razón por la que no la encuentro. No puedo evitar que una oleada de celos me ataque, él está muy cerca de ella, con su brazo sobre sus hombros. Sabía que ese imbécil se aprovecharía de mi ausencia, tengo que demostrarle de alguna manera que es mi novia, así que para empezar entro en mi Facebook y envío una solicitud de relación, gracias a que ella me dio su contraseña entro a su Facebook y lo acepto. Sé que se enojara por hacer esto, más cuando me pregunte la razón. Ella está en contra de exponer todo lo nuestro pero ya no se puede evitar. El mundo ya sabe lo nuestro y espero que ese imbécil sepa respetarlo. Dejo un mensaje diciéndole que estoy bien y lo que hice. Mañana tendré un día agitado, espero poder hablar, chatear o lo que sea. Necesito saber que estamos bien a pesar de la distancia. Luego de un pesado día lo único que necesito e darme un baño y meterme en la cama. Me inquieto mucho mi conversación con Steven, dijo que mi popularidad esta por los cielos y tengo miles de trabajos que me están siendo ofrecidos gracias a ello. Mi nueva relación es el tema del año. Todos quieren tener a alguien tan popular en sus películas y todo gracias a mi relación con una chica que no tiene que ver con Hollywood. Nuestra relación es comparada con un cuento de Disney, además está el hecho que saben que ahora domino el español lo que me da más punto a mi favor. Steven quiere que haga mi relación lo más publica posible, y para que Alex no se enterara que era yo quien lo provocaba tendría que quedarme cayado sobre esto, es algo inevitable que la prensa se meta en nuestras vidas, que yo haga algo mas no cambiaría mucho, eso creo. Me conecto al internet luego de una largo baño, veo que está conectada y antes de que puede saludarla tengo un mensaje suyo -\"¿Josh por qué lo hiciste? ¡!\" -\"Hola mi vida, ¿cómo te fue? A mi muy bien, extrañándote, aun cansado del viaje, pero con muchas ganas de saber de ti\" -\"No me vengas con eso Joshua Ryan Hutcherson, responde mi pregunta ahoraaaa\" -\"No pensé que te molestara, además todo mundo ya lo sabe, no tiene nada de malo\" -\"Tienes razón, gracias a ti todo mundo lo sabe, pero lo hiciste sin consultarme eso es lo que me enoja \" -\"Alex no te enojes por favor, ahora solo quiero saber cómo estas, si me has extrañado tanto como yo a ti\" -\"Eres imposible….ashhh\" -\"Pero así me quieres ;) \" -\"Ok, tienes razón te quiero, te adoro pero a veces eres desesperante\" -\"No me juzgues tan cruelmente, cuando se trata de ti ni yo se lo que hago 3 mejor dime ¿Cómo te fue con tus papás? \" -\"Ni me lo digas, en serio te mereces que te ahorque, tuve que soportar 2 horas de regaños, además no están contentos con nuestra relación\" -\"Mierda…! No me digas que mis suegritos ya me odian\" -\"Todo es tu culpa, pero bueno les dije que no te presente hasta estar segura de nuestra relación, así que me hicieron jurar que cuando vengas te conocerán\" -\"Bueno de eso no hay problema, hoy hable con Steven y podré viajar cuando tu estés de vacaciones, así que todo agosto estaremos juntos\" -\"Genial, no puedo esperar para verte, apenas nos separamos y no sabes cómo lo extraño\" -\"Y yo a usted señorita… no te imaginas cuanto, además el próximo domingo cumplimos un mes de novios, así que debemos planear algo, como estar en videoconferencia todo el día\" -\"No puedo, es el cumple de mi mami, así que eso en mi casa es igual a reunión familiar\" -\"Es cierto, si vez lo que provocas\" -\"¿Qué provoco?\" -\"Que solo piense en ti, me olvido de otras cosas\" -\"CURSIIIIIIIIII…. XD\" -\"Es la verdad! Bueno pero aunque sea debemos conectarnos un ratito en la noche xfs J \" No fue nada malo... pasará mucho tiempo hasta que su relación se complique, es inevitable.. la verdad siempre sale a la luz.. ¿Algunos me han preguntado el xq del nombre de la protagonista? -Ps les dire q asi se llamaba mi mejor amiga... se llamaba Alexandra, pero le decíamos Alex, ella era fan de Josh desde antes de que actuará en THG, pero falleció hace casi un año pporleucemia, asi que le dedique esta novela. Gracias x leerla: AVANCE La distancia no es obstáculo para que te deje de querer, me has hecho la persona más feliz al aceptar ser mi novia, quiero que sepas que en cada acción, cada pensamiento en mi vida te corresponde… FELIZ DÍA - Josh P.D. no soy romántico ni creativo, espero que hayas podido entender lo importante que eres para mí, te quiero -Milet 3[Chapter 24] Capítulo 24 Así han sido nuestros días, todas las noches hablamos sobre nuestro día, es el momento más esperado en mi día. Saber que estamos juntos y que pronto nos volveremos a ver. Mi vida se ha vuelto un poco caótica, todos se interesan por saber sobre nuestra relación, periodistas me atacan cuando salgo de mi casa, en la universidad para dar declaraciones. Trato de evitarlos, de ser cortes, pero en verdad quisiera mandarles por un tubo. Hoy es el cumple de mi mami y mi primer aniversario con Josh, me levante temprano con mi hermano y decidimos ir de comprar para poder cocinar algo delicioso para nuestra mamá. Como todos los domingos en mi casa se reúnen mi familia, mis tías, primas y primos, y en esta ocasión con más razón. Cuando regresamos de las compras veo que ya tenemos visitas, pues varios autos están estacionados en la entrada. Entro por la puerta de la cocina y veo a todos muy animados. -Hey Alex, por fin llegaste, tienes que ver tu sorpresa – me dice mi prima Claudia -¿Qué sorpresa? – señala al recibidor, termino de saludar a todos y me dirijo ahí y me encuentro con 2 arreglos florales, uno muy hermoso de lirios y rosas y otro más grande de rosas rojas con forma de corazón rodeado de orquídeas, me deja sin palabras. En medio del corazón está sujeto sobre donde está impreso \"Alex\", me acerco a tomarlo cuando me doy cuenta que toda mi querida familia está detrás de mí. -¿Quién trajo esto? -Un mensajero lo dejo, me dijo que un arreglo es para mí y otro para ti – dice mi mama – el mío vino con una tarjeta, es de tu novio -¿En verdad? -Sí, dile que le agradezco mucho por las flores y la tarjeta -¿Qué decía en la tarjeta? -Léela tú mismo – la tomo en mis manos y la leo: Espero que tenga un muy lindo día señora, quizás tenga una mala impresión de mí por la forma en que se dieron las cosas, pero créame que muero por conocerla personalmente, el simple hecho de que usted le haya dado la vida a la persona que más quiero le convierte en una de mis personas favoritas.. FELIZ DÍA – Josh - Definitivamente tu novio quiere ganarse a los suegritos – suelta mi prima Patricia riéndose -No me imagino lo que dirá en la carta que le escribió a ella – dice Claudia - Por cierto ¿Por qué te envió a ti también flores? -Porque hoy cumplimos 1 mes de novios -Ohh que tierno, lee a carta todos queremos saber que cursilerías te escribió -Están muy equivocados si piensan que la leeré frente a ustedes – les digo señalándoles con el dedo – como si no los conociera Todos insistieron en que la lea, en verdad quería burlarse de mí. Me encerré en el baño y abrí la carta: La distancia no es obstáculo para que te deje de querer, me has hecho la persona más feliz al aceptar ser mi novia, quiero que sepas que en cada acción, cada pensamiento en mi vida te corresponde… FELIZ DÍA - Josh P.D. no soy romántico ni creativo, espero que hayas podido entender lo importante que eres para mí, te quiero Ese tipo de detalles hacen que cada día lo quiera más. Abro mi Facebook para encontrarme con otra publicación. \"Entre tu millar de canciones encontré esta: (Te quiero - Hombres G www_youtube_com/watch?v=aiWxGTFDMkE ) , TE QUIERO, Feliz Aniversario Pequeña\" No sé qué de bueno hice para merecerme a este hombre, tiene todo lo que un mujer puede pedir. Gracias Dios por mandarme este ángel. Y aunque mi vida se tornó un poco extraña, me refiero que mi vida se ha vuelto publica, si salgo de fiesta, si como un helado, si salgo con un amigo, si me peino o no, todo es noticia; pero o soportaré todo por él. Quizás nuestras demostraciones de cariño son evidentes porque no dejamos de publicarnos mensajes en las redes sociales, pero en verdad es inevitable gritar al mundo lo que sentimos. Me resulta extraño ver fotos mías en la red, siempre he pensado que si he de ser conocida sería por algún logro importante que yo haya conseguido, no porque mi novio es famoso, pero trato de manejarlo con cautela. Algunas personas se me han acercado fans de Josh pidiéndome un autógrafo, lo que me parece lo más loco que me ha ocurrido, pero nada de eso puede ser una adversidad para este sentimiento que crece en mí por ese hermoso hombre. Termine mi semestre en la universidad, esta semana iré de extensión, que consiste en ir hacia comunidades de escasos recursos y alejadas de las ciudades, donde ayudaremos a mantener un registro de salud, dar vacunas y enseñar a prevenir enfermedades comunes de cada medio ambiente. La extensión dura una semana, en realidad: 1 día de viaje de ida, 4 días de trabajo, 1 día donde festejamos el fin de la extensión y el día del viaje de regreso. La comunidad que vamos en esta ocasión está ubicada a 4 horas de la capital, y el complejo turístico donde festejaremos el fin de la extensión queda a 2 horas. Josh está listo de vacaciones y vendrá a pasar este mes conmigo. No puedo evitar estar emocionada, no puedo dejar de contar los segundos. Acordamos que él me encontraría en el complejo turístico, acomodamos las fechas para poder estar encontrarnos ahí, disfrutar el festejo y volver juntos a mi ciudad. Estoy arreglando mis maletas, en 5 horas viajo a la extensión, donde estaré incomunicada. Antes de salir de mí casa publico una canción para Josh: (Tu Aire – Danny Ubeda www_youtube_com/watch?v=OXPqBIDdZF8 ) tengo q decir q habra mucho capítulo llenos de amor xcierto iempo.. asi q espero q los disfruten AVANCE: — ¿es en serio? ¿Primero besos y luego…? Nada más te falta levantar una pierna y marcarme como de tu territorio, omitamos lo de los líquidos de tu vejiga por favor Solté una carcajada muy fuerte al ver su rostro enfadado, en verdad era muy gracioso—Entonces te marcaré como una res y así él sabrá que tú eres mía, no de él —Josh, eres tan primitivo, también soy amiga de muchos chicos más, y eso nunca te ha molestado.[Chapter 25] Capítulo 25 A cada minuto me acerco más a mi destino, mi corazón palpita rápidamente mientras me acerco más a ella. Toda la rabia e ira que sentía se ha ido disipando. Cuando salí a de mi apartamento para dirigirme a el aeropuerto me encontré con Shannon. Ella vino a decirme que me quiere, que no le importa que yo este con Alex, ella estaría dispuesta a estar conmigo. La verdad me quede sin habla, como una mujer puede denigrarse de esa manera. Obviamente rechace su oferta lo que le hizo enfadar, y además de decirme que algún día volveré a sus brazos también insulto a mi novia, lo que me hizo perder la paciencia. Fui grosero pero se lo merecía. No sé si deba contárselo a Alex, creo que lo mejor será quedarme callado, además no gano nada preocupándola por algo sin importancia. He pensado mucho en lo que voy a hacer ahora, he tenido mucho tiempo para aclarar mis sentimientos y no pienso regresar a mi casa sin decirle que LA AMO, si amor, ella ha logrado meterse en mi corazón, su sencillez, su audacia, su dulzura, su constancia y muchas otras cosas han formado parte de mí y no lo pienso perder; solo espero que ella sienta lo mismo. No sé cómo paso, ni cuando, pero estoy irremediablemente enamorado de esa niña, y pienso luchar contra todo y todos para que ella me ame y poder estar juntos. -Señor llegamos al centro – el taxista me saca de mis pensamientos. Luego de bajar del avión tome un taxi para dirigirme al centro turístico donde estaría Alex. Sonrió como un estúpido cuando veo la entrada de este lugar. Luego de pagar mi boleto entro y veo un hermoso lago, el dueño me señala que debo rodear el lago para llegar a la cabaña principal. Me indica que hay varias cabañas de alquiler para pasar la noche, pero que los chicos compañeros de Alex no alquilaron ninguna porque ellos amanecen bailando hasta que llega su transporte para el viaje de regreso y están en la parte recreativa donde consta de piscinas, vestidores con duchas, el restaurante, la pista de baile, el bar y varias hamacas para poder descansar. Decido alquilar una cabaña junto al lago por esta noche, no permitiré que mi novia duerma en una hamaca incomoda, así de protector soy. Camino rápidamente rodeando el algo hasta la cabaña. Dejo mis maletas y me pongo unas bermudas y una camiseta, y como alma que lleva el diablo salgo en busca de esos ojos que me tienen loco. Puedo ver varios chicos bailando, bebiendo, comiendo, pero no hay señales de ella. Diviso a Santiago que está conversando con un chico, me acerco rápidamente a él -Santiago, que gusto -Waoooo Josh llegaste – nos damos un fraternal abrazo – tu novia estaba preocupada por ti -Mi vuelo se retrasó un poco, pero ya estoy aquí – le digo muy entusiasmado -Te presento a Diego – me dice señalando al muchacho que se encontraba con él -Un placer – le ofrezco mi mano – soy Josh Hutcherson mucho gusto -Es un gusto conocerte – el apreta mi mano – quería conocer al chico que se llevó a la niña de mis ojos - Me tenso instantáneamente, con cuantos pretendientes de mi novia tengo que luchar – tranquilo, Alex y yo tuvimos un pequeño romance y ahora somos buenos amigos, ella te quiere -Tranquilo Josh – dice Santy palmeándome en el hombro – ahora son amigos, no desconfíes mi amiga te quiere mucho y debes prepararte para conocer a todos sus ex amores, ella tuvo muchos y ahora son sus amigos – se burlo -No sé por qué eso no me hace sentir bien – le respondo desanimado -Jajajajaa tranquilo hermano, es fácil bromear contigo, por cierto tu novia está en la piscina, ya sabes como ama el agua, deberías ir rápido con ella antes de que se mate, está haciendo apuestas desde que altura se atreve a saltar y ella no nada Mi cara de susto debió ser obvia porque ellos se rieron. Me dirijo rápidamente a la piscina. Busco entre la gente pero no la encuentro. Algunos me reconocen y quieren acercarse pero seguramente por la cara que traigo no lo hacen. Miro arriba y la veo. Ella con una blusa de tirantes ajustada violeta y un short negro está en el nivel más alto de trampolines. Luce hermosa con su cabello mojado cayéndole en ondas enmarcando su rostro. Duda en lanzarse de ahí, en verdad está loca, ni siquiera sabe nadar, pero cuando la retan a algo nunca se detiene ni siquiera por el miedo hasta ganar. En verdad mi niña tiene algo mal en esa cabecita. -Alex mejor date por vencida no quiero que mueras – un chico le grita – es mejor que pagues la apuesta -Pareciera que no me conoces – grito ella Tengo ganas de romperle esa estilizada nariz a ese tipo por haberla puesto en esta situación. Sé que debo hacer algo pero a ella no puedo darle ordenes, sé que lo hará así yo no quiera. Lo mejor será que lo haga rápido y estar atento para ayudarla a que no se ahogue. -Alex – grito y ella inmediatamente me ve. Muestras miradas entran en contacto y ambos sonreímos tontamente – Tu puedes mi vida – la animo, ella retrocede unos pasos y corre. Salta del trampolín y cae en la piscina. Sentí que mi corazón se detuvo esos 4 metros hasta que el agua la reciba. Saque rápidamente mi playera y me lance al agua tras ella. Nade lo más rápidamente que mi cuerpo me permitió. Vi que ella trataba de salir, está un poco aturdida por la caida pero sabe mantenerse a flote. Dios tendré que buscar la manera de que aprenda a nadar y no solo a flotar. Llego a ella y nuestras miradas se cruzan. Enredo mis brazos es su cintura y ella los suyos en mi cuello. Antes de poder decirle algo tengo sus labios sobre los míos. Nos fundimos en un beso apasionado, dulce pero con urgencia. Era nuestra burbuja donde nos encontrábamos, el mundo no existe solo somos nosotros y nuestros labios que encajan de forma tan perfecta. Extrañaba esto, extraña esas descargas por todo mi cuerpo, extrañaba que mi corazón palpitara a mil por hora, la extrañaba a ella y su perfección. Por la intensidad del beso ambos dejamos de patalear y empezamos a hundirnos, nos dimos cuenta cuando el agua entro por nuestras narices, pataleamos tratando de subir a la superficie. Mis brazos aun en su cintura, porque aún no la quería soltar. -Sabes no me importaría ahogarme si obtengo esos besos a cambio – le guiño el ojo de forma picara un ligero rubor aparece en sus mejillas – hola Alex -Hola Josh- me sonríe y siento como me derrito, me acerco para rozar nuestros labios -Ustedes siempre tiene que hacer todo con tanto dramatismo – Santiago rompió nuestra burbuja gritando – Si quieren ser así de cariñosos consíganse una cama dejen de ensuciar nuestras mentes- todos se rieron por el comentario y Alex obviamente estaba más roja que un tomate, le ayude a salir de la piscina. -Te estuve esperando desde más temprano – coloco sus manos en sus caderas y mordiéndole el labio – pensé que no ibas a venir Me acerco a ella y con mi pulgar estiro su labio, es algo que hace inconscientemente cuando está preocupada o irritada, pero provoca en mí las ganas de devorarla y no solo a besos – El vuelo se retrasó, pero ya estoy aquí Solo nos abrazamos y nos dijimos lo mucho que nos extrañamos. Salude a todos los conocidos como Fer. Muchos se acercaron para pedirme autógrafos, era algo a lo que estaba acostumbrado. Muchas chicas pidieron hacer fotos alejándome de mi novia y por lo visto no disfrutaba para nada mi cercanía a estas chicas. Tenía la esperanza de que esta celosa, si eso era verdad ella debe sentir algo muy fuerte por mí, la ilusión de que me ame al igual que yo a ella quemaba en mi interior. Pasamos la tarde en la piscina, jugando, conversando. Me hablo que harían una fogata junto al lago luego de la merienda y por ultimo bailarían y cantarían karaoke hasta que el transporte que contrataron llegue por la mañana. Le dije que alquile una cabaña por si queríamos descansar o bañarnos. Merendamos con Santiago, Fernanda y Diego. No sé por qué él no me daba buena espina. Tenía la impresión que se comía a mi novia con los ojos. Además la abrazaba cada que podía y ella no hacía nada por evitarlo. -Alex hoy tienes que cantar a dúo conmigo en la fogata – dijo el mientras pasaba su brazo por sus hombros lo que hizo que mi ira interna y las ganas de golpear su perfecta nariz aumentara -Claro, debemos cantar las que practicamos esta semana -¿practicaron? ¿Estuvieron juntos? ¿Por qué diablos no me lo mencionó? -Nosotros dos somos perfectos el uno con el otro, claro para el canto – obviamente esa aclaración estuvo demás, su intención era clara -Me permites robarme a MI NOVIA – dije apartando su brazo y resaltando las palabras- Tengo que hablar con ella – él sonrió satisfecho por mi molestia y la mirada molesta de mi novia era evidente. La tome de la cintura, haciéndola girar, la bese aunque ella no correspondió a mis besos, lo que me confirmo que estaba molesta, se sintió bien hacerlo frente a ese estúpido. Fuimos hasta la cabaña, la deje pasar primero y cerré la puerta detrás de mí. Se giró para enfrentarme con su ceño fruncido — ¿es en serio? ¿Primero besos y luego…? Nada más te falta levantar una pierna y marcarme como de tu territorio, omitamos lo de los líquidos de tu vejiga por favor Solté una carcajada muy fuerte al ver su rostro enfadado, en verdad era muy gracioso—Entonces te marcaré como una res y así él sabrá que tú eres mía, no de él —Josh, eres tan primitivo, también soy amiga de muchos chicos más, y eso nunca te ha molestado. —Pero ninguno de ellos quiere contigo, él si…. —Eso que más da…yo estoy contigo eso debería ser suficiente para que confíes en mí – me dio las espaldas – además el ya no es mi novio, somos amigos… — No quiero que salgas con él – solté, sus manos se hicieron puños apretando fuertemente hasta que sus nudillos se pusieron blancos por la fuerza —¡Hey! Detente ahí querido— gritó — Creo que entendemos que soy una persona pensante que toma sus propias decisiones y que tú no me puedes decir con quien salgo, de quién soy amiga y de quién no. —Pero… —La única persona que puede decidir eso SOY YO – su mirada llena de ira me fulminó - Josh en serio ¿Me estas prohibiendo algo? -Lo lamento ¿sí? – ella tenía razón, pero me era difícil no sentirme así - Más vale que lo lamentes, porque si las cosas son así no van a resultar – el miedo me invadió con esas palabras, no podía perderla, no por unos estúpidos celos – por más que te quiera no puedo permitir que trates de controlar mi vida -Por favor, no te enojes, no sé cómo explicártelo, pero me siento inseguro – ella abrió la boca para decir algo y yo la interrumpí – no de ti, si no de mí, aun no puedo aceptar que estés conmigo, sé que soy un tonto pero en verdad confío en ti, pero estos celos son inevitables, no quiero arruinarlo, prometo arreglar esto, solo no quiero que estemos mal por una tontería -eso espero – me acerco a ella y la tomo de la cintura – una relación funciona solo si hay confianza Josh, espero que entiendas eso…. Además yo debería sentirme insegura -¿porque tú? -porque tu estas rodeado de chicas extremadamente sexys, y esas fans que te comen con la mirada – sus puños se apretaron de nuevo -¿estas celosa? – mi sonrisa arrogante se hizo presente -Si – solto frustrada- más vale que quites esa estúpida sonrisa de tu cara, para mí no es fácil verte rodeado de tantas chicas y aun así no estoy prohibiéndote nada -Entendí tu punto, no volverá a pasar, ahora quiero disfrutarte, quiero tenerte solo para mí – abrace su cintura besándola y sus brazos rodearon mi cuello -Será mejor que me dé una ducha – dijo cuándo nos separamos -¿Tan rápido ya estas caliente? No necesitas una ducha yo puedo resolver esto – sonreí pícaramente y su rostro se volvió tomate -Yo… me refería... a ducharme para prepararme para la fogata – dijo titubeando -Lo se mi vida, solo era un broma – soltó un suspiro – no sé porque te pones así cuando hablamos de sexo, eso debería ser algo normal para ti, lo digo por las bromas de tus amigos, además vas a ser médico, debería ser normal -Si supieras – lo dijo tan bajo, pero lo escuche, lo que me llevo a seguir pensando en que tuvo alguna mala experiencia o algo sucedió para que se incomode así cuando hablamos de sexo -Dúchate tu primero, luego iré yo, mi cabello se seca más rápido – tomo una tolla y se metió en el baño Bueno Josh esta de vuelta con su novia... aun estan juntos pero las inseguridades los rodean AVANCE: Su boca abandona mis labios y empieza a recorrer mi mandíbula y mi cuello dejando pequeños besos y mordidas. Mi cuerpo está en alerta, cada movimiento que él hace me produce mayor satisfacción y necesidad. Con mis manos tomo su rostro y lo atraigo hacia el mío. Sus besos son mi droga y soy una adicta a ellos. Su mano viaja desde mi rodilla hacia mi cadera, sus ojos me miran llenos de deseo y mi mente no puede pensar con claridad. Se lo que estamos haciendo, pero no sé si debemos detenernos.[Chapter 26] Capítulo 26 No puedo creer como mi enojo se esfumo con un simple discurso de Josh. Él debe entender que odio que las personas me controlen o quieran interferir en mis decisiones, así son las cosas conmigo. Además no entiendo porque siente celos, le he demostrado de mil formas que solo lo quiero a él, sería incapaz de engañarlo, eso es algo imperdonable, no entiendo como las personas puedes engañar a sus parejas, es del asco, si Josh me hiciera ello, nunca, nunca, por más que lo quiera lo perdonaría. Me meto en la ducha refrescándome. Mis músculos simplemente se relajan con las gotas cayendo por mi cuerpo. La ducha definitivamente es el lugar más perfecto para meditar. Sonrío al recordar a mi novio. Ese niño me trae saltando en un pie, simplemente es perfecto. Salgo de la ducha y me envuelvo en la toalla. Nunca he podido cambiarme, olvide mi ropa por la no costumbre. Dudo que haya problema, Josh entrará y podré cambiarme tranquilamente. Abro la puerta despacio y lo veo de espaldas buscando algo en su maleta que está sobre la cama. -Listo puedes entrar – se gira para verme y s boca literalmente cayo. Me di cuenta de sus ojos observando de arriba abajo recorriendo cada centímetro de mi cuerpo. Mi sonrojo debe ser evidente cuando me di cuenta lo imprudente que fui, esto es una forma de provocarlo, después de todo es un chico -¿Josh? Siento como traga y un gemido bajo sale de su garganta, me siento nerviosa ante su mirada llena de lujuria, mi cuerpo tiembla pero al mismo tiempo una sensación de hormigueo recorre por mis venas, llenándome de sensaciones extrañas pero satisfactorias. Josh da un paso hacia mí notando mi incomodidad -Lo lamento, no debí inspeccionarte de esa forma, no quise hacerte sentir incomoda - su pulgar acaricia mi mejilla bajando hacia mi mentón, enviando millares de ráfagas por mi columna -No te preocupes, creo que después de todo eres un chico – cojo aire para continuar – no debería haber salido así… -Si soy un chico – acuna mi rostro haciéndolo mirar – un chico que está loco por ti, pero que te respeta y nunca haría nada morboso y mucho menos algo que no quisieras.. Esas palabras hacen que mi corazón brinque de felicidad, no creo que haya alguien más dulce que mi novio. Así que junto nuestros labios para dulce beso, el cual corresponde sin dudarlo. Sus brazos se envuelven en mi cintura pegándome a su cuerpo lo que me hace vibrar de satisfacción. Mis brazos automáticamente se enredan alrededor de su cuello y nuestro beso se profundiza. Nuestros labios se amoldan perfectamente y nuestras lenguas danzan. Mi corazón late a mil por hora, en estos momentos no sé si para vivir necesito aire o sus besos, simplemente me presiono más contra él. Nuestro beso es más intenso y en verdad no quiero detenerlo, siento un hambre, una necesidad creciente por él. Nos movemos de un lado al otro mientras nos estrellamos en la cama. Él sobre mí sin romper nuestro beso. Mis manos viajan por su espalda de arriba abajo y mis dedos no pueden sentirse mejor sobre su piel. Su boca abandona mis labios y empieza a recorrer mi mandíbula y mi cuello dejando pequeños besos y mordidas. Mi cuerpo está en alerta, cada movimiento que él hace me produce mayor satisfacción y necesidad. Con mis manos tomo su rostro y lo atraigo hacia el mío. Sus besos son mi droga y soy una adicta a ellos. Su mano viaja desde mi rodilla hacia mi cadera, sus ojos me miran llenos de deseo y mi mente no puede pensar con claridad. Se lo que estamos haciendo, pero no sé si debemos detenernos. Si romper nuestro beso, él hace que giremos para que yo este sobre él. Ese instante su maleta cae al suelo haciendo un gran estruendo, lo que nos hace reaccionar. Nos miramos por un instante respirando agitadamente. Mi sonrojo debió hacerse presente porque su rostro se tornó sombrío. Él sabe que me arrepiento de lo que acaba de pasar, pero la verdad es que ni yo estoy segura de ello. Me aparto de él rápidamente sujetando mi toalla. Giro hacia dónde está mi ropa dándole la espalda. Escucho sus movimientos al ponerse de pie y avanzar suavemente hacia mí -Deberías bañarte Josh – mi tono es desesperado, no quiero ver su rostro, mi vergüenza sería mayor – todos deben estarnos esperando -Alex – su voz tiene un tono de suplica -Apresúrate Josh, necesito cambiarme – él toma su toalla y entra al baño sin antes soltar un suspiro de frustración Me cambio rápidamente, salgo lo más rápido de la cabaña. No debí permitir que esto pasará. No estoy lista aun para la intimidad y mi maldito cuerpo reacciona a sus caricias. Aun no es tiempo de que estemos juntos, no sé si este preparada para tener sexo alguna vez, pero no quiero que sea ahora. Quiero que sea con la persona adecuada, en el momento adecuado. De verdad debo dejar de provocar a Josh, lo entiendo, él es hombre, es parte de su naturaleza buscar sexo. Pero si quiero que esto funcione debo evitarlo. Quizás sea mi inseguridad de que él solo busque eso en mí, o quizás sea por mí propia inseguridad. -Alex ¿estás bien? – Diego me saca de mis pensamientos -Claro, no pasa nada – mi respuesta es muy insegura -No te metí en problemas con tu novio por mis comentarios ¿verdad? -No para nada, él es un poco celoso pero puedo controlar eso -Es un buen tipo ¿verdad? -Si lo es – una sonrisa se forma en mi rostro ante su recuerdo -¿lo quieres no es así? -Sí, debo admitirlo, lo quiero mucho -¿Entonces no tengo ninguna esperanza? -Lo lamento Diego, no quiero dañarte pero no me imagino mi vida con alguien más que no sea Josh -No te preocupes, yo estoy feliz de que tu encuentres el amor, por lo menos siempre seré tu amigo, eso es suficiente para mí -Siempre Diego, siempre serás un gran amigo para mí, porque siempre estas a mi lado para acompañarme en mis locuras, siempre me comprendes y me apoyas sin juzgarme – lo abrazo – me perdonaste luego de dejarte por Darío, eso fue importante para mí -Sabía que Darío era un estúpido, pero era tu felicidad en esos momentos, no niego que me dolió, pero la satisfacción de verte feliz supero todos esos malos sentimientos Nos quedamos abrazados por un momento, este niño en verdad era dulce, no entiendo como no me enamore de él. Aunque ahora es tarde para eso, quiero a Josh, él me hace feliz. -Gracias Diego, en verdad – beso su mejilla y me separó de él. Regreso mi vista hacia la cabaña donde veo a Josh parado mirándome con decepción. El cierra la puerta bruscamente y se dirige al bar. Mierda, esta celoso y esta vez tengo que darle la razón. No quise que hablemos sobre lo que paso, salgo de la cabaña casi huyendo y el me ve abrazando y besando a otro. Camino detrás de él, pero su paso es rápido. En un momento desaparece de mi campo visual. Lo busco sin encontrarlo. No sé dónde está, mi desesperación va en aumento y mi corazón quiere llorar. Regreso a la cabaña y me tumbo a la cama a llorar. Por lo estúpida que soy, por hacerle y hacernos daño. Hola ! de nuevo .. bueno les dire q he avanzado un poco en la historia... he escrito capítulos q ocurrirán muy en el futuro, pero es q aveces las ideas vienen.. solo teng q trabajar en los capítulos q enlacen las ideas para q queden bien.. A veces cuando leo libros me gusta mucho lo q dicen y las charlas de los protagonistas pero si analizamos esas cosas, esas palabras no se dicen en la vida real.. por eso trato de usar frases q comunmente usamos en nuestro vivir... como dije antes la idea de la historia es q sea lo mas real posible.. para sentirnos identificadas ¿Que les pareció este momento HOT? ya era hora q las hormonas actuen AVANCE: -Sabes que saber que otro chico quiere con mi chica no me hace sentir mejor ¿verdad? -Josh, deja esos celos estúpidos, ella está contigo, es todo lo que te debería importar… millones de chicas están detrás de ti y ella confía en tu celoso trasero sin cuestionar nada, lo menos que debes hacer es corresponder a esa confianza -Tienes razón, que estúpido que fui…. -Si fuiste estúpido.., en cuanto a lo otro es una larga historia… ella es una chica que también tiene deseos carnales, pero tuvo una mala experiencia con ello, así que ahora evita el tema… -Lo sabía, sospechaba que tuvo algún tipo de mala experiencia…por favor, dime que paso -Ella me matará si se entera que te lo dije, pero todo sea por el bien del amor – suspira – bueno eso tiene que ver con Darío CREO q deje inconcluso la parte de xq Alex quiso alejarse de Darío.. este capítulo lo hice para cerrar ciertos círculos... nos vemos proximamente..![Chapter 27] Capítulo 27 Mientras las gotas caen en mi cuerpo trato de pensar en lo que paso. Ambos nos dejamos llevar por ese beso, obviamente ambos tenemos una fuerte atracción por el otro, en especial yo que no puedo dejar de tener mis manos sobre ella. Es tan bella, tan hermosa, es la mujer de mis sueños, pero hay algo que está mal. Es verdad, es muy pronto para que tengamos sexo, bueno si fuera por mí la hubiera metido en mi cama el día que la conocí, pero ahora es diferente, quiero que los 2 estemos listos, que no simplemente sea el deseo lo que nos lleve a esto, si no amor, dulzura, cariño. Necesito saber porque reacciona así. Mi mente me indica que ella tuvo una pésima experiencia con lo que se refiere al sexo, no es normal que ella reaccione así. En verdad cuando nos separamos pude ver un poco de dolor en su rostro, tengo que averiguar qué diablos paso, y si alguien le hizo daño juro que lo hare pagar. Salgo de la ducha y me visto rápidamente, entro en la habitación y no hay señales de ella. Salgo en busca de ella y apenas paso el umbral de la puerta la encuentro abrazada con ese estúpido de Diego, la ola de celos nuevamente me inunda y mis inseguridades de nuevo aparecen. No sé qué hacer más que seguir mirándolos, cuando ella lo besa, no sé si fue en la boca o en la mejilla pero esa simple acción me hace sentir más herido. Ella se voltea y me mira, seguramente se dio de cuenta de mi enojo, simplemente no quiero verla, asi que me alejo de ella. Su voz llamándome se hace presente, pero en estos momentos necesito estar solo, porque en este estado seguramente terminare peleando con ella, necesito pensar correctamente para no arruinarlo. Me dirijo al bar pero me escabullo para dirigirme al lago, donde un árbol me sirve de escondite. Lanzo piedras al agua tratando de que mi furia disminuya. Suelto un suspiro de tristeza y frustración, cuando escucho unos pasos detrás de mí. Quizás es ella, me encontró así que es hora de hablar, solo espero no arruinarlo todo. -Hey, puedo sentarme – la voz de Fernanda me sorprende, ella se sienta a mi lado – ¿Por qué tan solo Josh? ¿Problemas en el paraíso? -Algo así… es que a veces no puedo entenderla. -Entiendo, mi amiga es complicada, pero ella te quiere, en verdad nunca la había visto enamorada de esa forma de alguien. -¿en serio? ¿ni siquiera de Darío? -Ni siquiera de ese estúpido, vamos cuéntame lo que paso, tal vez pueda ayudarte, de todas formas me enteraré por lo que ella me cuente, pero prefiero darte mis sabios consejos. No puedo evitar sonreír por su entusiasmo. Le cuento todo lo que paso, desde lo del beso y su reacción al ver lo que nos dejamos llevar hasta su abrazo o beso con Diego. -bueno primero que todo no desconfíes de ella, Josh ella te adora nunca te haría nada que te pueda hacer daño, en cuanto a Diego, él la ama aunque ella sea la única que no lo vea, pero nunca se interpondría en su felicidad, él se conforma con seguir siendo su amigo y ellos son como hermanos.. asi que no te preocupes por ello, en todo caso trata de llevarte bien con él, es una muy buena persona a pesar de sus sentimientos en serio. -Sabes que enterarme que otro chico quiere con mi chica no me hace sentir mejor ¿verdad? -Josh, deja esos celos estúpidos, ella está contigo, es todo lo que te debería importar… millones de chicas están detrás de ti y ella confía en tu celoso trasero sin cuestionar nada, lo menos que debes hacer es corresponder a esa confianza. -Tienes razón, que estúpido que fui…. -Si fuiste estúpido.., en cuanto a lo otro es una larga historia… ella es una chica que también tiene deseos carnales, pero tuvo una mala experiencia con ello, así que ahora evita el tema… -Lo sabía, sospechaba que tuvo algún tipo de mala experiencia…por favor, dime que paso. -Ella me matará si se entera que te lo dije, pero todo sea por el bien del amor – suspira – bueno eso tiene que ver con Darío. -¿Darío? ¿Qué hizo ese estúpido? -tranquilo, no trato de violarla si eso es lo que estás pensando… antes de que Alex viajara ellos tenía una relación medio extraña… desde que se conocieron ellos tenían una atracción inevitable. El simple hecho que se quedaran solos provocaba una combustión a esa pasión, donde siempre terminaban en besos y muchas veces casi en algo más. Ellos nunca formalizaron nada, porque resulta que Darío tenia novia. Ella lo sabía pero no le importaba, ella y él mantenían su relación como un juego, pero ella se enamoró y no lo aceptaba y siguió dejando que las cosas sucedieran. Cuando por fin acepto su amor por él, decidió arriesgarse y decírselo, ella ya no soportaba que él tuviera a alguien más, así que decidió jugarse todo o nada. El día que ella le confeso su amor, él no dijo nada simplemente la beso y ella lleno los espacios en blanco pensando en que fue correspondida, la pasión de ellos se desato y estuvieron a punto de hacerlo, ella necesitaba escuchar que él la amaba así que los detuvo antes de dar ese paso. Darío pensó que ella se arrepintió de estar con él y muy estúpidamente le dijo que la deseaba que eso era todo, que simplemente lo de ellos fue deseo y atracción. Por supuesto mi amiga salió de ahí, con el corazón hecho pedazos y se dio cuenta que él solo quería sexo. -Entonces cada vez que ella deja salir esa pasión, recuerda que esa experiencia de que simplemente la deseaba para sexo – solté un gran suspiro – eso explicaría mucho, pero créeme que ese estúpido pagará por haberla hecho sufrir. -No creo que debas hacer nada, él muy estúpido se dio cuenta de sus sentimientos cuando ella estuvo lejos… nunca entendí porque ella acepto estar con él después de todo lo que él le hizo, supongo que aún lo quería. -Debió amarlo mucho para perdonarlo. -No empieces con tus celos Josh - me advirtió – si, ella lo amaba, pero lo que ustedes tienen a mi parecer es mucho más fuerte que lo de ellos, así que más te vale que levantes tu celoso trasero y arregles las cosas con ella, deja tus inseguridades y hazla feliz, ella se lo merece. -Gracias Fer, en serio, te debo millón – le beso en la mejilla. -Ya no me babees, ve por ella, la vi buscándote y me pareció muy afligida. -Eres la mejor – le grite mientras corría en busca de mi novia. No la encontré en ningún sitio, así que voy hacia la cabaña con la esperanza de encontrarla. Escucho sus sollozos apenas cruzo el umbral. Ella esta tirada en la cama llorando, mi corazón inmediatamente se parte, odio verla así. Cierro la puerta detrás de mí y me siento hundiendo mi peso en la cama. Su llanto se corta instantáneamente pero su rostro sigue hundido en la almohada - Alex, lo lamento tanto – pongo mi mano en su hombro para hacerla girar y ella se resiste - No Josh, no quiero que me veas… soy horrible – sus palabras son un susurro, acompañando del típico hipo que viene luego de llorar. -No digas pequeña, eres hermosa, por fuera y por dentro, ahora mírame por favor ¿si? -No, no lo soy, soy una pésima persona, no merezco tenerte. -Alex por favor – mi tono de súplica funciona, ella se gira mostrándome su rostro rojo y sus ojos hinchado, tomo su rosto acunándolo y limpio esas lágrimas con mi pulgares – no tengo nada que perdonarte, simplemente soy un imbécil por no poder evitar esos celos y ponerte en esta situación -Yo soy el problema, debería comprenderte, es lógico que sientas celos, mientras tanto yo te provoco, el problema soy yo ¿entiendes? -Alexandra, entiende – la tomo de los hombros para que me mire – desde que empezamos esta relación yo he hecho demasiadas estupideces y tú siempre terminas echándote la culpa, ya basta- la sacudo un poco, un creciente ira por su actitud crece dentro de mí – debes dejar de aceptar la culpa de todo el mundo, debes dejar de hacerte responsable y sentirte culpable por cosas que no son tu….. tú no eres el problema, eres la persona más perfecta que he conocido. -No soy perfecta – me interrumpe. -Para mí eres perfecta, el único problema es que cargas con culpas ajenas, por favor déjame cargar con mi culpa, no quiero que sufras por qué crees que eres el problema – lágrimas se derraman por sus mejillas y la atraigo a mí en un abrazo mientras acaricio su cabello – perdóname ¿si?, no quiero verte así nunca, te prometo, te juro que evitare tener celos estúpidos, Fer me explico todo, me hizo entender que debo confiar en ti, no es que antes no lo hiciera, pero ahora estoy seguro de que los celos son injustificados. -¿Hablaste con Fernanda? -Sí, tuvimos una larga charla, ella te quiere mucho ¿sabes? -y yo a ella – entierra su rostro en mi cuello, donde su tibio aliento me relaja -¿entonces, estamos bien? –mi pregunta es necesaria, necesito saber que ella entendió que no todo es su culpa, que odio verla sufrir y que cambiare para alejar esos estúpidos celos. Ella deposita un beso en mi cuello, que hace estremecerse a mi cuerpo – tomaré eso como un SI -Josh… ¿en verdad me quieres? -Eso nunca lo dudes – tomo su rostro acunándolo, es ahora o nunca, debo decirle cuanto la amo –yo te… - me interrumpe antes de que pueda decirlo -¿Me quieres aunque sea una obsesionada por estar en una peluquería cada mes para que me hagan rizos en mi cabello? – no puedo evitar sonreír. -No pensé que leíste ese reportaje que hicieron sobre ti, ¿en verdad no pueden aceptar que tus rizos son naturales? – La beso en la frente – pero aun así te quisiera mucho -Es difícil no leer noticias sobre ti cuando los reporteros se te atraviesan en tu camino preguntándote si es verdad – ella también sonríe – entonces… ¿me quieres aunque me hayan puesto silicona en mi trasero? Es difícil contenerse la risa, en verdad la prensa farandulera no se cansa de inventar cosas estúpidas sobre las personas, ella también ríe y me mira con el ceño fruncido pero divertido – ni siquiera mi trasero es tan grande para que digan ese tipo de cosas. -Para mí tu trasero es perfecto y muy lindo – mi sonrisa pícara sale a relucir sin que lo pueda evitar, a lo que ella me da un puñetazo en el hombro – Auch, eso dolió. -Para que dejes de ser un pervertido – su rostro se torna de un entero sonrojo. -No puedo decir mentiras – le hago un puchero – tienes un trasero muy lindo, por eso creen que es artificial, hasta yo lo dudaría. -Josh, eres terrible, ¿Cómo puedes pensar que estoy interesada en cirugías y mucho menos estéticas? -No tengo manera de comprobarlo – su cara desafiante me divierte, así que pienso llevar esta charla un poco más lejos. -Claro que lo puedes comprobar – su rostro desafiante se llena de una mirada picara, ella nunca abandona un reto, es algo que siempre uso a mi favor. Ella se pone de pie y yo hago lo mismo. -ah ¿si? ¿Cómo? – antes de que reacciones ella toma mis manos y las pone en su trasero, me siento nervioso sin saber qué hacer, nuestras miradas se mantienen y antes de que pueda decir algo ella me besa, correspondo a su beso que no es tierno ni dulce, es pasional, como el que nos dimos cuando ella salió de la ducha. Nuestro beso termina y sus manos que están sobre las mías se aprietan invitándome a apretar su trasero, lo hago con suavidad, tratando de que no parezca algo morboso. – Bueno, eso me comprueba que mi novia tiene un perfecto trasero natural. -Estúpido – sus brazos se enredan en mi cuello y un beso cálido me es regalado. -Si lo soy, pero soy tu estúpido. -Eso fue realmente cursi – dice contra mis labios y yo sonrío en respuesta. -Bueno pues todo es tu culpa, por si no has leído revistas actualmente soy considerado un chico romántico por dedicarle casi a diario a mi novia canciones en las redes sociales -Dios! – empieza a reir – y yo soy la novia fría que a lo mucho pone ME GUSTA en Facebook. -Bueno, tú sabes que la prensa inventa esas cosas, pero es verdad que me encanta dedicarte canciones. -Y a mí me encanta que me las dediques – me besa en la punta de la nariz – ahora vamos a ver que paso con los demás – la atraigo para besarla y ella me corresponde intensamente. -¿sabes hay algo que tienes que saber? –digo interrumpiendo nuestro beso. -No hables ahora – me da otro beso – en estos momentos solo quiero besarte. -Yo también quiero hacerlo, pero tenemos una conversación pendiente señorita – ella se separa de mi lado con frustración y se sienta en la cama. - bueno, adelante, suéltalo – me dice haciendo un puchero. -Lo que paso antes… bueno… quería que sepas que yo no pienso obligarte a dar ese pasó. -Eso ya me lo dijiste Josh, perdóname a mí por actuar de ese modo. -Ya quedamos en que nada de disculpas Alex, solo quiero estar seguro de que sepas eso, yo esperaré hasta que esté preparada no me importa cuando ocurra eso, solo debes saber que yo te respeto. -Lo se Josh, es solo que….. es algo difícil para mí, no sé cómo explicártelo. -Tranquila, yo sé lo que paso entre Darío y tú, yo se… -¿Cómo? Mierda, Fernanda te lo dijo, la voy a matar – se pone de pie furiosa y antes de que salga por la puerta abrazo su cintura y la siento en mi regazo. -Ella me lo dijo porque necesitaba saberlo, no te niego que me hubiera gustado saberlo de tu boca, pero eso no importa, no te enojes con ella – beso su frente arrugada. -Es que… es que… -Tú nunca me lo ibas a decir y yo necesitaba respuestas, ya tenía la sospecha de que tuviste alguna mala experiencia pero ahora que lo se quiero cambiar eso –me mira incrédula – no quiero que pienses que te quiero meter en mi cama simplemente, el sexo es parte de la vida y si lo tenemos en algún momento es porque ambos lo queremos y porque lo necesitemos… -Es que… Josh, yo también quiero estar contigo, mi mente mi cuerpo quieren estar contigo, pero se me es difícil no sentir desconfianza después de eso, solo necesito tiempo – lo último lo dijo como un susurro. -Lo sé, solo no quiero que cuando nos dejemos llevar un poco por la pasión no tengas miedo, yo me puedo detener en el momento que lo desees. -Te quiero Josh – su mano acaricia mi mejilla, yo pongo mi mano sobre ella cerrando mis ojos para que esa sensación tan placentera se guarde en mi memoria. HOLA A TODOS.. actualice antes de tiempo xq saldré de viaje... como les dije los próximos capítulo tendran mucho amor.. despues de todo ellos deben conocerse mejor y que su relación florezca... espero q escuchen las canciones de la historia porque en verdad las letras son beuans y se van enlazando con la historia..! AVANCE: La música suena y mi corazón empieza a brincar al reconocer la melodía, ( Nada se compara a ti - Carlos Baute ft Franco de Vita: www_youtube_com/watch?v=Bf19CqiTVj0 ) , mis ojos pican por las lágrima que trato de retener, la esperanza en mi corazón de que este chico me ama como yo a él crece. Él y Diego canta a dúo, aunque Josh no es un experto cantando no lo hace nada mal, aprecio de que haya pensado en esa canción, aprecio que se aprendiera la letras incluyendo que es en español. Todos los acompañan con las palmas incluso yo.[Chapter 28] Capítulo 28 Salimos de la cabaña para dirigirnos a la gran fogata que organizaron los chicos. Todos están bailando al ritmo de las melodías que Diego y su banda tocan con sus guitarras. Son canciones de amor muy bonitas. Hemos convertido esto de cantar y bailar en todas nuestras reuniones. -Por fin terminaron de hacer cosas obscenas estos tortolitos – Santy como siempre con sus comentarios, Josh me mira de reojo y luego me atrae hacia él. -Bueno si tienes razón Santy, ¿envidia? – hecho a reír por la cara que puso mi amigo -juegas sucio hermano – responde él con otra sonrisa. Diego empieza a tocar una canción que me encanta y simplemente tomo de las manos a Josh y lo llevo junto con las demás parejas que bailan. (Pídeme - Danny Ubeda www_youtube_com/watch?v=_ETZk70HH_A ) . Pongo mis brazos alrededor de su cuello y el envuelve mi cintura con sus brazos. Nos movemos de un lado al otro mirándonos directamente, me acerco a su oído y le susurro: - Espero que te guste esta canción, porque quiero dedicártela – y empiezo a moverme al ritmo de ella, ya que un poco rápida. Mientras nos balanceamos la canto en su oído y el besa mi cuelo cada cierto tiempo. Cuando termina la canción espero con ansias su respuesta, mientras nos seguimos balanceando con la nueva canción, pero él no me dice nada. -Alex! – me giro a ver quién me llama y es Diego -Creo que es hora de cantar nuestra canción – me ofrece su mano – Vamos -Ya voy, dame un minuto – me giro hacia Josh para ver un poco de celos reprimidos en su mirada – No te lo dije porque quería que fuera una sorpresa – entonces le doy un pequeño beso en la mejilla y camino hacia donde esta Diego listo con su guitarra, sentándome a su lado. -Bueno amigos, aquí hemos practicado una canción romántica en ingles a petición de esta pequeña, y aunque ella dice no ser cursi con esto ha demostrado que si lo es – todos empiezan a reírse por sus comentarios, sabiendo lo \"supuestamente anticursi\" que soy. La guitarra empieza brindar su melodía y yo simplemente busco al dueño de mi corazón con la mirada. En cuanto lo encuentro me pierdo en sus hermosos ojos y canto: (Just A kiss - Lady Antebellum www_youtube_com/watch?v=HbaH1odA-DE ) . Nuestra conexión nunca se rompió, mientras trataba de trasmitirle todos mis sentimientos a través de la melodía no podía evitar darme cuenta lo mucho que dependo de él, lo mucho que lo quiero y lo mucho que deseo que se quede a mi lado. Cuando terminamos todos nos aplauden, yo me levanto caminando hacia él que me recibe con los brazos abiertos, pero sin decirme palabras me acerca a él y deposita un tierno beso en mi frente. Luego de unas canciones más, todos nos dirigimos hacia la pista de baile donde cantaríamos karaoke y bailaríamos hasta el amanecer. Josh aún no dice ninguna palabra lo que me hace sentir asustada y cómoda al mismo tiempo. Seguimos abrazados mientras escuchamos a Diego cantando (Pienso en Ti – Jonnathan Luna www_youtube_com/watch?v=MkGC4AQTL70 ) . -Sabes esa canción dice mucho ¿no crees? – Josh rompe el silencio. -Si es muy bonita, cuando empezamos a salir él me la dedico alguna vez. -Bueno pues muy bueno escogiendo canciones, sabes – me estrecha más a él – aun no termino de escuchar toda tu música, debo admitir que me gusta tu tipo de variedad. -¿mi tipo de variedad? -Escuchas de todo un poco, pero al mismo tiempo está relacionado, quiero decir no son canciones al azar porque suenan bien, si no porque tienen algún significado. -Bueno eso es verdad, siempre busco canciones que me trasmitan algo no importa el ritmo - vemos a Diego venir hacia nosotros. -¿te gustó? – me pregunta -Si muy linda la verdad – tengo miedo que Josh otra vez sienta celos, y no sé cómo romper este incomodo momento, antes de poder decir algo Josh le ofrece una mano a Diego. -Amigo, lamento haberme comportado grosero contigo hace un rato – Diego lo mira con recelo pero estrecha su mano también. -No importa hermano. Yo también me sintiera furioso si alguien coquetea con mi chica, pero te aseguro que no tienes nada de qué preocuparte. -Lo sé – responde mi novio dándome un beso en mi coronilla, me hace sentir orgullosa saber que es capaz de aceptar sus errores y disculparse, ya no es el Josh arrogante que conocí en Denver. - Entonces nos vemos luego . -Espera – dice Josh, me suelta y se aleja con él, yo miro curiosa por saber de qué hablan, cuando veo que se dirigen al escenario. Yo me quedo anonadada sin saber qué pasa. Josh se sube con Diego al escenario, mi novio se acerca al micrófono -Buenoooo, Hola a todos, creo que ya me conocen, soy el nuevo en su grupo – todos rien – quiero dedicar esta canción a mi novia – me sonríe- Alex, esto es para ti La música suena y mi corazón empieza a brincar al reconocer la melodía, ( Nada se compara a ti - Carlos Baute ft Franco de Vita: www_youtube_com/watch?v=Bf19CqiTVj0 ) , mis ojos pican por las lágrima que trato de retener, la esperanza en mi corazón de que este chico me ama como yo a él crece. Él y Diego canta a dúo, aunque Josh no es un experto cantando no lo hace nada mal, aprecio de que haya pensado en esa canción, aprecio que se aprendiera la letras incluyendo que es en español. Todos los acompañan con las palmas incluso yo. -NADA SE COMPARA A TI, DESDE QUE TE CONOCI TE QUIERO A MORIR – Josh termina la canción y baja rápidamente del escenario y acude a mi encuentro, la música empieza a sonar y veo que todos empiezan a bailar, yo simplemente tengo ojos para él. Cuando llega, acuna mi rostro y me da un beso muy delicado pero muy dulce, cuando nos separamos no puedo evitar sonreír - ¿Por qué sonríes? - pregunta uniendo nuestras frentes. Yo abro los ojos y veo directamente a esas perlas marrones que me observan con un brillo en ellos. - Porque estoy feliz - responde y me sonríe. No me acostumbro todavía a sentir ese cosquilleo en el estómago y el escalofrío que me recorre mi columna vertebral cada vez que me roza con sus manos. Es una sensación nueva y gratificante. No puedo describir todo lo siento ahora porque mi cuerpo esta descontrolado, mi corazón salta de un lado a otro y todos mis músculos se vuelven gelatina ante sus fuertes brazos que me envuelven y antes esos labios que me devoran. -Me alegra ser el motivo de esa felicidad. Ok.. quizas fue exagerado el canto de Josh.. pero quise agregar un poco de música en verdad les recomiendo la canción PIENSO EN TI y NADA SE COMPARA A TI.. las letras me han llegado al corazón. Espero que me disculpen las faltas de ortografía, la verdad es que no tengo tiempo de revisar los capítulos muchas veces cuando los subo. Como ven las cosas se van poniendo calientes entre ellos y ya pude dejar atras el asunto con Darío, debo aclarar que él es un buen chico, que ama a Alex sinceramente, aunque como mucho cometió errores. les prometí unos capítulos mas de amor, quizas los encuentren un poco aburridos o lentos pero la verdad quiero que se de cuenta como la relación entre ellos evoluciona, porque no tendría sentido dar saltos y que las cosas queden a medias... Gracias por sus reviwes y mensajes con sugerencias de canciones. AVANCE: -Hola – me dice mirándome y acariciando mi mejilla, yo pongo mi mano sobre la de ella disfrutando esa sensación de su piel contra la mía - Hola princesa -Sabes lo mucho que te extrañe estos meses -Si lo sé, creo haberlo experimentado también – ella me sonríe y m corazón salta al saber que fui yo quien le saco esa sonrisa -¿ah sí? Pues yo te extrañe más que tú a mí - No lo creo princesa, yo me volví adicto a ti, así que estuve en estado de abstinencia, ¿sabes lo horrible que es eso?[Chapter 29] Capítulo 29 En verdad creo que esa canción fue lo mejor pude hacer, mejor que cualquier regalo, mejor que cualquier línea que pudiera decirle. Sé que la música es la mejor forma de trasmitirle un mensaje como ella lo hizo cuando canto para mí. Luego de horas de baile, claro, ella luciéndose y yo tratando de seguir el ritmo. No es que no sepa bailar pero en mi medio no bailamos este tipo de ritmos, vamos más por electrónica, hip hop y esos ritmos, en los cuales si soy bueno. Mientras ella fue al baño le pedí al DJ una canción en especial. Debía demostrar que estoy al nivel de mi novia bailarina. -Ya volví. -Bueno pues ahora te tengo otra sorpresa – le digo abrazándola por su espalda y besando su mejilla. -¿y qué es?- pregunta curiosa. -Ya lo veras – justo mi canción empieza a sonar, la suelto y me dirijo al centro de la pista donde todos automáticamente hacen un circulo a mi alrededor dejándome suficiente espacio. Con el ritmo en mis venas hago mi baile más complicada, lleno de giros, volteretas y todo lo que pueda hacer para lucirme. Todos me animan al parecer sorprendidos, algunos tienen celulares por lo que mañana seguramente estaré en youtube. Cuando termino todos me aplauden y trato de apaciguar mi respiración y recuperar mi aliento. Me abro paso hacia dónde está mi novia. -Waaaaao, eso fue fabuloso – ella me recibe emocionada entregándome una pequeña toalla para limpiar mi sudor. -Gracias, ¿en verdad te gusto? -Claro, siempre quise verte bailar así, nunca me lo mostraste aunque me dijiste que lo hacías. -Bueno, siempre hay que guara un As bajo la manga – me acerco para abrazarla, parece que ninguno de los dos podemos mantenernos alejados del otro, lo que para mí está bien. Bailamos hasta el amanecer hasta que el transporte llego por todos. Subimos y nos sentamos juntos, ella junto a la ventana y yo junto al pasillo. Todos estaban cansados y 15 minutos después de partir por este largo viaje, todos se quedaron dormidos; incluyendo a mi novia quien se acomodó en mi regazo, su rostro en mi pecha y mis brazos rodeándole. Se ve tan bella cuando duerme, aun espero el día en que su rostro sea lo último que vea al acostarme y lo primero que vea al despertarme. Su rostro es tan tranquilo y su respiración suave representa una melodía para mis oídos. Miro hacia el asiento de lado y ahí veo a Santy y Fernanda durmiendo, ella también está siendo abrazada por él, no sé por qué pero tengo el presentimiento que ahí hay algo más que una amistad, tendré que preguntárselo a mi novia. No sé cuándo ni cuanto dormí, pero cuando abro mis ojos miro a mi novia mirando el hermoso paisaje por la ventana, la estrecho más hacia mí y ella entrelaza nuestros dedos de ambas manos. -Sabes – supira – me encanta ver el cielo, me encanta que sea diferente a cada hora, y me encanta ver esos cambios – beso su cuello y ella sonríe – la luz del sol en la mañana lo hace una mezcla de gris y azul, al medio día es un azul brillante y el momento en que la luz se va todo se vuele rápidamente naranja, rojo, y negro cuando por fin sale la luna, todo es un cambio sutil, no puedo explicar porque me encanta, pero lo amo, es hermoso. -Bueno no tan hermoso como tú, pero entiendo lo que quieres decir - pongo mi mentón en su hombro. -Hola – me dice mirándome y acariciando mi mejilla, yo pongo mi mano sobre la de ella disfrutando esa sensación de su piel contra la mía. - Hola princesa. -Sabes lo mucho que te extrañe estos meses. -Si lo sé, creo haberlo experimentado también – ella me sonríe y m corazón salta al saber que fui yo quien le saco esa sonrisa. -¿ah sí? Pues yo te extrañe más que tú a mí. -No lo creo princesa, yo me volví adicto a ti, así que estuve en estado de abstinencia, ¿sabes lo horrible que es eso? – ella se levanta colocándose a horcajadas sobre mí, miro nerviosamente a otros y todos continúan dormidos. -Quieres saber ¿Cuánto te extrañe? – yo asiento y ella me besa intensamente, no dudo en corresponder la furia de su beso, nuestras lenguas danzan, nuestro labios se funden y no puedo evitar excitarme por esa acción. Mis manos viajan rápidamente desde sus rodillas hacia sus caderas y suben por los costados de su torso, lo que provoca un gemido de su garganta. Es imposible que mi amigo no reaccione a estos estímulos, porque empiezo a sentir como la sangre de mi cuerpo se concentra en él, obviamente no puedo pensar en qué hacer. Ella continúa besándome y yo no puedo detenerla, mejor dicho no quiero. Ella abandona mis labios y empieza a besar mi rostro dejando un rastro de besos desde mi oreja hasta mi mandíbula, cuando se detiene. Debió sentir a mi amigo golpeando su muslo, ella me mira sonrojada y no puedo evitar sonrojarme también. Ella se baja rápidamente de mí y se acomoda en su asiento, rápidamente la abrazo de la forma más dulce tratando de romper la incomodidad del momento. -Lo siento Josh – suspira – a veces se me olvida que eres un chico y que esas cosas pueden pasar. -No tienes por qué sentirlo, es normal, y mucho más cuando mi novia es tan sexy y hermosa, pero no vamos a avanzar más de lo que tú quieras. -Bueno tu amigo no dice eso exactamente – suelta una risa – ¿puedo confesarte algo? -Claro hermosa dime. -No quiero sexo, pero eso no quita que quiero avanzar un poco más que solo besos – inmediatamente su piel se vuelve roja como un tomate. -Bueno, estoy para servirte – yo también sonrío imaginándome la variedad de cosas que podemos hacer – siempre me he preguntado cómo puedes ponerte de ese color con tu piel morena. -Yo también quisiera saber eso, es otro misterio de la vida, ahora tratemos de dormir. -Tienes razón, solo espero que mi amigo también se duerma – ella me da un codazo en mi estómago – Auch, eso duele, no es mi culpa que lo alientes y luego lo abandones. -Basta Josh – me dice riendo – más vale que te duermas – son dejar de sonreír se acomoda entre mis brazos y ambos caemos nuevamente en un profundo sueño. Cuando llegamos era ya las 9 de la noche, deje a mi novia en su casa y llegue a la de mis abuelos. Acomode toda mi ropa en mi habitación, me tumbe en mi cama y tras horas de dar vueltas ya que no podía dormir decidí buscar mi guitarra. Salir al patio trasero y me senté bajo el pequeño manzano. La melodía simplemente salió (Give me love – Ed Sheeran à www_youtube_com/watch?v=GMnI6WzwFsM), el silencio de la noche y el silbido del viento me acompañaron para sacar lo siento. Cada día me siento más raro, pero no es ese tipo de rareza que está mal, sino todo lo contrario, por primera vez siento que mi vida está completa, por primera vez se lo que es la verdadera. El amor. El amor en esas pequeñas cosas, en esos pequeños detalles, en esas pequeñas sonrisas que son solo para mí. La amo, más que a nada, más que a mi vida, y no pienso perder eso por nada en este mundo. Si soy su felicidad lucharé por que así sea, si no lo soy viviré feliz si ella lo es. Daré todo de mí, buscare la manera, luchare contra todos los obstáculos por la única razón que me hace sentir completa, por ella. En 2 días cumpliremos 3 meses de novios y lo único que deseo es poder tener el valor de declararle mi amor y que ella sienta lo mismo. Sería la persona más feliz del universo, ser dueño de su corazón seria el mayor honor que puedo tener en esta vida. Compartir una vida con ella no será suficiente para agradecerle a la vida por ponerla en mi camino. Aunque mañana no la veré, pasado mañana será un día importante. Conoceré a su familia, no puedo ignorar lo nervioso que me siento con ello, necesito que me acepten, sé que eso es importante para ella y obviamente también para mí. Mañana tendré que comprar un traje de gala que no traje conmigo, ese día será el anuncio de compromiso de su hermano y también darán a conocer la fecha de la boda. Mi novia no pudo encontrar otro momento más adecuado, con los nervios aun sobre mi piel logro dormirme, obviamente pensando en ella. Me levante temprano para ir de compras, necesita encontrar unos regalitos, y conseguirme un traje. Cuando llegue a mi casa a almorzar, le envié un texto a mi novia. -\"Hey tú! Te has olvidado de mí! - \"Hola, Buenos días pequeño.. tú nunca dejas mis pensamientos, deberías saberlo.\" - \"Mi corazón dio un brinco con esas palabras ¿Cómo estás?\" - \" ;) la verdad nunca he sido buena con las cosas de chicas, esto de buscar vestidos con mi mamá y mis primas es muy cansado y frustrante.\" -\"¿puedes darte una escapadita? Necesito decirte \"Buenos días\".\" -\"Mmmm, eso suena bien, pero no creo que pueda desaparecer más de 5 mits, podría decir que estoy probándome un vestido ;) \" -\"¿En dónde estás? No importa si son 5 minutos, no serán suficientes pero apaciguaran a mi corazón por el resto del día.\" Me indico la dirección y salí hacia el centro comercial inmediatamente. Llegue al departamento de ropa, me pare frente a los vestidores y la busque con la mirada sin encontrarla, cuando alguien me tomo por el brazo y me atrajo dentro de uno de los vestidores. Me sorprendió este movimiento, cuando sentí sus labios sobre los míos y la común sensación electrificante que recorre mi cuerpo cada vez que nos besamos. Sus brazos se enredaron en mi cuello y los míos fueron a su cintura. El contacto de mis dedos con su piel desnuda hizo que me sobresaltara, moví mis manos recorriendo su espalda cayendo en cuenta que no traía ninguna blusa, solamente su sujetador. Nos separamos para respirar juntando nuestras frentes sin abrir los ojos. -Buenos días – le dije sonriendo contra sus labios, abrí los ojos y me hundí en la profundidad de su mirada. -Lo correcto sería decir \"Buenas Tardes\" ¿sabías? -Cuando estoy contigo pierdo la noción del tiempo – le doy un beso fugaz – por cierto ¿Qué fue eso? -No eres el único que extraña nuestro contacto – sonrío picara – abrí la puerta y ahí estabas, no podía permitir que mi mamá te vea. -Debo decir que me encanto eso – le digo en su oído gruñendo un poco. -Más vale que no mires hacia abajo Hutcherson, o te prometo que vas a extrañar en serio el que no te bese – la idea de verla sin blusa cruzo mi mente tan pronto como sentí su piel bajo mis dedos. -¿me estas amenazando? Tú eres la que provoca a mi amigo y luego tengo que pagar las consecuencias. -¿prefieres una ducha fría o una vida sin mis labios? -Eres muy mala… mala y calculadora – beso nuevamente pero esta vez mas dulcemente -Pero así como soy, tú me quieres – sonrío contra mis labios, cuando iba a responderle unos golpes en la puerta nos sobresaltaron a ambos. -Alex, te quedo ese vestido o vamos por otro – ella cubrió mi boca con su mano -Definitivamente debemos buscar otro, termino de vestirme y salgo -Ok, pero date prisa que aún tenemos mucho que comprar – esperamos a que se aleje de la puerta. -Pues creo que nuestros cinco minutos se acabaron – hizo un puchero que me estrujo el corazón- Mañana te quiero a las 10am en mi casa, se puntual por favor. -Estoy contando los minutos para volverte a ver – la beso con pasión sin querer separarme de ella, fue mi novia quien se separó de mi luego de ponerse su blusa, obviamente sin dejarme verla, y abrió la puerta. -Mañana Josh, se puntual – y cerró la puerta dejándome en un vestidor todo caliente y con mi amigo pidiendo su atención. Definitivamente esta niña me va a matar. HOLIS..! espero q les haya gustado el capítulo... no publicaré muy seguido xq ya regrese a clases, pero cuando publique los capítulos serán mas largos. Agradezco x sus reviews y nuevamente para las personas q me enviaron mns de si podía publicar la historia, claro q lo pueden hacer, solo avisenme para seguirles la pista.. Sigo aceptando sus recomendaciones de canciones para poderlas usar mas adelante. COMO VEN LAS COSAS SE VAN PONIENDO CALIENTES ENTRE ELLOS... PERO LOS SENTIMIENTOS DE CADA UNO SON INTENSOS, EL PROBLEMA VA EN QUE SON DE MUNDOS DIFERENTES, SOBREVIVIRÁ SU AMOR? QUIEN DIRA PRIMERO ESAS PALABRAS? AVANCE: -Es hora de que lo presentes a tu papá, está en el jardín – dijo mi abuela – tranquila si trata de ahorcarlo nosotros acudiremos en su ayuda –nos guiño el ojo haciendo a todos soltar carcajadas excepto a Josh y a mí. -No sé si eso me hace sentir aliviado o con ganas de salir corriendo – Josh me susurro y no pude evitar sonreír nerviosamente. - 3 Milet[Chapter 30] Capítulo 30 Toda mi familia estaba reunida en mi casa. Hoy mi hermano anunciaría su compromiso oficialmente con su novia Diana, y darían a conocer la fecha de la boda. Mis dedos se mueven sin que pueda detenerlos, quizás fue una mala idea escoger hoy para presentar a mi novio a toda mi familia. Pensé que mientras más gente este será menos incómodo y mis papas no tendrán oportunidad de hacerle el \"interrogatorio\", pero por los nervios que bailan en mi estómago, definitivamente no fue una buena idea. Miro mi reloj, debería estar ya aquí, le dije que sea puntual… Mierda!, más le vale llegar lo más pronto posible, antes de que sirvan los bocadillos y hagan el brindis. Suena el timbre de mi casa y salto rápidamente de mi silla dirigiéndome a la puerta. -Tranquila Alex, parece que tu fueras la que se va a casar – Andrea bromea por mi paso apresurada, mi papi me mira con el ceño fruncido y yo les regalo una sonrisa a todos tratando de ocultar mi nerviosismo. Cuando abro la puerta que da hacia la calle mi corazón pega un brinco cuando veo a mi sexy novio con un sombrero moderno y sus gafas oscuras que prácticamente me hacen babear. -Perdóname por la tardanza – toma mis manos y me jala hacia el dándome un tierno beso fugaz – tenía que traer unas cosas – me indica las bolsas que tiene en su mano derecha -No tenías que comprar nada -Tonterías, tengo que dar una buena impresión a mi futura familia – me besa la punta de la nariz – podrías sostener esto, hay algo que debo traer del auto -Claro – tomo las bolsas y él se dirige a mi auto, regresa con un ramo de rosas rojas - ¿es eso para mí? -Alex – mi mamá se asoma -¿Por qué tardan tanto? – mira a Josh y sonríe – Hola -Buenos días señora – Josh se acerca rápidamente a mi madre – un gusto conocerla -El gusto es mío ¿Josh, verdad? -Sí, el mismo – le ofrece el ramo de rosas – para usted señora -Oh, son hermosas, muchas gracias – mi mamá se entusiasma con las flores, le encantan los detalles, así que podría decir que Josh se la ha ganado – pero pasen, todos están en la sala, yo iré a poner estas flores en agua – ella entra rumbo a la cocina -Así que no eran para mí ¿eh? -Nop, para ti tengo otra cosa – no detenemos en el umbral de la puerta. -¿en serio? – mis brazos envuelven su cuello - ¿Qué?- desde el bolsillo de su chaqueta saca una pequeña caja de cristal que en su interior conserva 3 dientes de león perfectamente conservados -¿te gusto? – me quedo sin palabras, claro que me gusto, es un detalle muy hermoso, son esos detalles que me hacen quererlo más – Feliz Aniversario - sin perder el tiempo me acerco para besarlo lento y duro. -Ok, más vale que entres antes de que tu papá salga a buscarte – nos separamos al escuchar a mi prima Andrea –Hola Josh, es un placer conocerte – le ofrece la mano y Josh la saluda también – Creo que no es una buena idea que den ese tipo de espectáculos por hoy, al tío no le gustará nada. -Tiene razón mi vida – Josh me abraza por la espalda sonriéndome- quiero que mi nueva familia me quiera, no espero que piensen que soy una mala influencia. -Yo no diría mala influencia – dijo Andrea levantando las cejas – yo diría que te la quieres devorar, no creo que estén de acuerdo – su sonrisa pícara me provoco un sonrojo – Vamos adentro, tu hermano ya fue por la familia de su novia, aprovecha el tiempo antes que lleguen para presentar a tu novio-devora-labios. Soltamos unas carcajadas mientras nos dirigimos a la sala. Ahí estaban mis tíos y tías, mis primos y mi única abuela viva. Aunque lo niegue Josh estaba nervioso, mientras les presente a todos. Mi familia estaba muy feliz de que por fin les presente un novio. Todos lo recibieron con los brazos abiertos y él se los metió en su bolsa rápidamente. -Es hora de que lo presentes a tu papá, está en el jardín – dijo mi abuela – tranquila si trata de ahorcarlo nosotros acudiremos en su ayuda –nos guiño el ojo haciendo a todos soltar carcajadas excepto a Josh y a mí. -No sé si eso me hace sentir aliviado o con ganas de salir corriendo – Josh me susurro y no pude evitar sonreír nerviosamente. Salimos al jardín donde colocaron las mesas para el almuerzo. Mi familia es muy unida, todos nos apoyamos mutuamente y en verdad significa mucho para mí que aprueben a Josh. Mi papá estaba en el jardín recostado en la hamaca leyendo, nos acercamos a él tomados de las manos, debido a los nervios nuestro agarre fue fuerte, mi mami se acercó con nosotros. -Hola papi – él se incorporó rápidamente – te presento a Josh. -Mucho gusto señor – mi novio ofreció su mano rápidamente y mi papá dudo un poco en corresponder su saludo pero lo hizo. -Igualmente, pero tomen asiento – nos indicó las sillas y rápidamente nos sentamos – tenemos unas cosas que hablar antes de que lleguen los invitados. -Cariño, no seas duros con ellos, toda la familia ama a Josh, no se lo hagas difícil – mi mamá nos sonrío y se dirigió a la cocina. -Bien, iré al punto – su semblante se tornó serio – no me gusta la idea de que mi hija tenga novio, sé que ya es mayor y tiene todo el derecho, pero a ningún padre le gusta eso. Yo sé que ella ha tenido más chicos con quienes ha salido pero nunca nos presentó a alguien formalmente, eso quiere decir que eres importante, aunque no me gusto enterarme por programas de farándula su relación – tomo un poco de té que tenía a su lado volví mi mirada notando que todos estaban mirando por la ventana nuestra conversación, tuve que reprimir la sonrisa. -lo único que espero es que te comportes como un caballero, mientras estés aquí, considerando tu trabajo en EEUU eres bienvenido a esta casa a horas prudentes al igual que podrán salir juntos pero – dijo señalándome – tienes toque de queda a las 10pm – estuve a punto de protestar – no quiero protestas Alexandra, sé que ya tienes 20 años, pero es mi casa y mis reglas; además no quiero que interrumpas sus estudios así que te agradecería que tus visitas sean durante las vacaciones para facilitarnos y evitarnos los problemas. -Claro señor -Y por último quiero que hagas feliz a mi niña, aun no te conozco pero sé que la haces feliz, no quiero que la dañes y espero que siempre seas respetuoso, no me hagas arrepentir de darte esta oportunidad con mi niña. -No señor, puede estar tranquilo, nunca haría nada para dañar a Alex, ella es muy especial y también me hace feliz, la quiero y la respeto, agradezco su confianza no lo decepcionaré. -Eso espero - me acerque a mi padre, lo abrace porque me di cuenta que esto no era fácil para él. Deposite un beso en su mejilla susurrándole \"gracias papi te quiero mucho\", cuando me aleje miro a Josh – sé que no están casados pero igualmente BIENVENIDO A LA FAMILIA. Ambos se dieron un abrazo fraternal, lo que me hizo soltar el aire que no sabía que estaba conteniendo. Agradezco a Dios y a la vida por darme una familia tan comprensiva y a un novio tan bello. -Tengo un regalo para usted, señor – dice mi novio entregándole un paquete a mi papá. -No eran necesarios los sobornos – dice mi papá divertido abriendo el paquete, de donde aparece un vino – por esta vez lo aceptaré, este vino es delicioso, años que no lo he probado, debió costarte mucho. -No se preocupe, es lo menos que podía hacer, mi madre me castigaría si llegara con las manos vacías a otra casa. -Gracias Hijo, más tarde brindaremos tú y yo con este vino. Ayudamos a servir toda la vajilla y la comida, ya que pronto llegaría Andrés, su novia y la familia de ella. Es una chica muy linda, en verdad la llegue a apreciar y estoy feliz del compromiso de mi hermano, él se ve tan feliz. Espero yo ser así de feliz cuando me casé… -Robaría un banco por saber que estás pensando – Josh me saca de mis pensamientos abrazándome por la espalda y las mariposas de mi estómago no se hacen esperar. -En nada en especial – beso su mejilla – creo que todo salió maravillosamente y estuvimos preocupándonos en vano. -Tu familia es adorable, me siento muy cómodo con todos, por cierto ¿Dónde están las pequeñas Emily y Renata? quiero entregarles el regalo que les compre. -¿Eso era lo que estaba en las otras bolsas? – asintió – no debiste haberte preocupado. - No es molestia, muero por verlas y quiero que me acepten y la mejor forma de llegar a un niño es con dulces y juguetes. -¿te gustan los sobornos? Es bueno saberlo – le guiñé el ojo y su sonrisa pícara no se hizo esperar – vamos, deben estar arriba jugando en mi habitación. Subimos a mi habitación y encontramos a las pequeñas jugando con mis peluches – son hermosas las pequeñas, quisiera que mis hijos tengan ese color de ojos – dice Josh viendo a la pequeñas - Sabes tú eres igual a tu papá. -Lo sé, no tengo parecido con mi mamá.. Como viste todas mis primas y estas pequeñas son rubias, blancas y sus ojos son verdes con marrón como mi mamá, mi hermano y yo somos morenos como mi papá. -Sí, pero eso no te quita lo hermosa – dice besando mi nariz – además nuestros hijos tendrán muchas posibilidades de heredar los ojos de su abuelita, según la leyes de la genética. La idea de tener hijos con Josh me estruja el corazón de la felicidad, quizás nunca pase pero eso no quita que eso me haga feliz – bueno si, pero no me importaría que tengan tus ojos. -Yo quiero que tengan tu cabello y que hereden tu carácter – me envuelve en sus brazos. -No creo que sea una buena idea, mi carácter no es nada fácil de controlar – con sus labios alcanza el lóbulo de mi oreja succionándolo lo que me hace vibrar mi cuerpo. -No es fácil de controlar pero si de amar. -Sabes…- deposita más besos en mi cuello – eres…. Increíble.. no me dejas concentrar Josh. Él se ríe al verme afligida - yo solo estoy besándote. -Ese es el problema, no me dejas concentrar. -¿ah no? – antes de que me diera cuenta pasa su brazo por mis rodillas y me levanta del suelo y cuando iba a dejar escapar un grito él lo sofoco con un beso. Camino conmigo con mis brazos alrededor de su cuello y me deposito en mi cama sin romper nuestro beso que cada vez era más pasional. -Adess, ucaa – la pequeña Renata nos sacó de nuestra burbuja, ambos tratado de controlar nuestra respiración. Me levanto de la cama y hago lo que la pequeña quiere amarcándola. -¿tienes hambre pequeña? -Nooo- dice negando con su cabeza también. -¿entonces tienes sueño? – asiente y la acomodó en mis brazos para que pueda dormir. De las 2 pequeñas, Renata es la más apegada a mí, siempre que estoy con ella soy como su mamá, la cambio, le doy de comer, le hago dormir – Josh, pásame la manta que está en el sofá. Mi novio hace lo que le pido y vuelve a sentarse sobre mi cama sin quitarme la mirada. Cubro a la pequeña con la colchita rosa y empiezo a balancearla mientras le canto una nana. De seguro tiene tanto sueño porque rápidamente sus párpados caen. Siento los brazos de Josh envolverse en mi cintura y su mentón en mi hombro – Serás una madre estupenda ¿lo sabías? -Bueno quiero tener varios hijos, todos los que me pueda permitir – seguimos balanceándonos y yo tarareando la nana, pero sin dejar de mirarnos. Un nuevo capítulo... ¿que les pareció ambos tienen familias muy compresivas e impresionantes.. no necesariamente debe haber sufrimiento en la vida de las personas para que estas sean buenas.. es mi teoría.. De nuevo gracias x sus reviews y mensajes.. y es pero q compartan la historia para q nuevas personas opinen :) Solo para q se piquen (como dicen en mi país) Josh tiene un gran secreto sobre su relación con Alex y su carrera, pero ella tambien tiene un secreto sobre su vida q mas adelante afectará.. espero q sigan leyendo y lo descubran.. ¿Quisiera saber q opinan de los personajes? -Josh -Alex -Santy -Fernanda AVANCE: -Y tú no deberías provocarme – me toma de los hombros – eres mía, recuérdalo. -Un momentito..- la ira empezó a inundarme, no quiero tener otra vez esta pelea pero él tiene que entender – deja de tratarme como si fuera un objeto de tu propiedad, sabes que no lo soporto. -Y tu deja de darme motivos para tener que demostrar que estás conmigo – arrancó el auto sin darme tiempo a salir de este. Es la misma pelea siempre, sus celos e inseguridades, no le he dado motivos para que desconfíe. Además odio que me trate como un objeto, diablos, soy una persona, no pertenezco a nadie. El camino al cine es en silencio. La tensión entre nosotros es tan evidente que podría cortarse con cuchillo.[Chapter 31] Capítulo 31 Cuando dejamos a la nena durmiendo, tomados de la mano bajamos a la sala cuando Andrés llego con la familia de su novia, estaba presentado a todos. Apenas nos vio se acercó con una la chica que supongo es su prometida, dos señores que imagino son sus futuros suegro y otra chica más joven que podría ser la hermana de su prometida por el parecido. -Karen ya conoces a mi hermana y él es Josh su novio - la saludamos y Andrés nos sigue presentando -Señor Pedro señora Sofía ella es mi hermana Alexandra. -Mucho gusto – mi novia y yo los saludamos. -Y ella es Karen la hermana de Diana – la chica que estaba distraída de repente abrió los ojos como platos mirándome fijamente. -Oh por Dios, eres Josh Hutcherson – salto y envolvió los brazos en mi cuello, casi caigo por la fuerza que se abalanzo contra mí – no lo puedo creer, por fin te conozco, sabía que tu novia vivía aquí pero nunca pensé encontrarte – miré a mi novia que tenía un gesto incómodo y para evitar problemas con sutileza desenrollé los brazos de esta chica y la aleje de mí. -Dios Karen – dijo Diana – compórtate, puede que sea u ídolo pero eso justifica tu comportamiento, lo lamento Josh. -No hay problema- vi la decepción en los ojos de Karen - cuando saluden a todos podemos conversar si quieres? – su rostro se ilumino. -Con permiso, necesito ver algo arriba – mi novia con su ceño fruncido subió nuevamente las escaleras. Algo me dice que estoy en graves problemas, me disculpo y voy tras ella. La puerta de su habitación está cerrada por lo que toco para que me deje entrar. -Alex, ¿Qué pasa pequeña?- sigo tocando y no tengo respuesta – por favor, si hice algo que te molesto me disculpo pero habla conmigo princesa. -Lárgate Joshua – que diga mi nombre completo no es buena señal – no quiero hablar contigo. -¿hice algo de malo? – pregunte recostado contra su puerta, la sonrisa de mis labios ante la compresión del porqué de su actitud. -Si no quitas esa sonrisota de tu cara Hutcherson mucho menos te voy a abrir – reprimo una carcajada por su comentario, ella sí que me conoce. -No estoy sonriendo princesa, ahora ábreme por favor. -No te quiero ver, Josh. -Si no me quieres ver, ábreme la puerta y tapate los ojos – oigo como reprime una carcajada y quita el seguro de la puerta. Cuando entro, cierro la puerta detrás de mí y la encuentro sentada en el filo de su cama con sus manos sobre sus ojos. Me aproximo a ella y empiezo a hacerle cosquillas. Ella ser retuerce bajo mi cuerpo y rodamos por su cama. En medio de la risa caímos al piso, yo me di un buen golpe en mi espalda y ella cayó sobre mí. Cuando nos miramos, soltamos carcajadas más fuertes. Aproveche su distracción y ataque sus labios. Ella correspondió mi beso que estaba lleno de lujuria y diversión. -¿Con que no me querías ver, eh? - Esto no es precisamente verte – me dijo con un toque de sarcasmo, intento ponerse de pie, pero yo lo evito y ruedo nuestros cuerpos para quedar yo encima de ella. -Ahora me puedes decir porque estas tan enojada. -No debería decírtelo – me dice seria, por lo que decido persuadirla. -¿Ah no? – sostengo sus manos a cada lado de su cabeza y empiezo a dejar besos y pequeñas mordidas por su mandíbula y cuello. -No – dice soltando suspiros – has sido un niño muy malo. -Sí, muy malo.. – digo mordiendo el lóbulo de su oreja – deberías castigarme. -Definitivamente debería hacerlo – el tono de su voz tiene un tono pícaro que hace que todos mis sentidos estén alertas – debería evitar que me beses, eso es un buen castigo. Mi cara debe reflejar dolor, porque ella reprime carcajadas – No es justo Alex, ni siquiera sé porque estas enojada – hago una mueca de dolor y ella suelta carcajadas sin poder reprimirse más. -Deberías dejar de coquetear a todas esas chicas locas por ti. -¿Celosa? -Estás haciendo que tu castigo sea más grande Hutcherson. -No es justo Alex, no estaba coqueteando, tu viste que ella se me lanzo, yo solo no quise ser grosero – aunque amaba que este celosa no quiero pelear por cosas como estas – Además solo tengo ojos para ti. -Pues mantenla alejada de ti, tu eres solo mío, escuchaste – oírla hablar así me emociona enormemente, porque es verdad, soy de ella, pero es fantástico oírlo de sus labios. -Soy solo tuyo – beso su cuello lo que le provoca cosquillas – me mantendré lejos de ella, pero no me castigues. -Está bien, solo porque con ese castigo no eres el único que sufre – y sin perder tiempo nos lanzamos a otra sesión de besos. El resto de día lo pasamos sin contratiempos. Permanecimos juntos todo el tiempo. Cada vez que Karen intentaba acercarse, de la forma más educada que podía la evitaba. Debo admitir que es una chica bonita y muy insistente, pero no me interesa en absoluto meterme en problemas con mi novia por ella. La familia de Alex es muy graciosa y genial. Me aceptaron como uno de ellos y me sentí muy a gusto. Luego de la comida, del brindis y la petición formal de matrimonio, anunciaron la fecha de matrimonio. Será la semana antes de la premiere de Catching Fire, así que tendré que hablar con Steven para poder asistir. Ya me comprometí con Andrés en asistir y ser acompañante de Alex, ya que ella es una de las damas. Y más que todo porque no quiero a ningún chico con un brazo alrededor de mi chica. Hola.. estoy actualizando pronto porque ya termine un nuevo capítulo. ¿que les parece? lo celos son mutuos. ellos son una pareja de lo mas normal. pero no olviden que existen muchas mentiras de en medio. Creo que Darío ha desaparecido un poco verdad?. No crean que él es un villano.. todo lo contrario. Él es un chico que como todos cometió errores pero ama a Alex con todo su corazón y esta dispuesto a dar un paso atrás si es por su felicidad. Mas adelante lo volveremos a tener y lo conoceremos mejor.. así como a Fernanda y Santiago. Espero q compartan la historia para tener mas comentarios, les prometo que mas adelante habrá mas emocion, como les dije ahora su relación debe fortalecerse. Aunque ninguna a pronunciado las palabras mas reveladoras \"Te Amo\" ambos están seguros de sus sentimiento..! Gracias por sus reviews y mensajes..! AVANCE: -¿Te gusta lo que ves? – me pregunta con tono de picardía, mientras yo me acomodo en el asiento del copiloto cerrando la puerta. -Ni te imaginas – le respondo guiñándole el ojo. -Pues todo esto es tuyo, solo tienes que tomarlo. -Paso, tengo la suficiente mercancía como para adquirir más – su sonrisa cayó al entender mi chiste de mal gusto. Y no pude evitar echarme a reír.[Chapter 32] Capítulo 32 Con Josh hemos pasado prácticamente todos los días juntos. Gracias al cielo las vacaciones de esta temporada eran largas, así podría aprovechar a mi chico al máximo. Estas dos semanas solo han servido para reafirmar mis sentimientos por él. Cada día hemos aprendido cosas nuevas del otro, cada día somos más unidos, cada día estamos más enamorados. Bueno por lo menos de mí parte. Esta es la última semana que Josh estará conmigo, pronto el volverá a su trabajo y yo regresaré a clases… estoy lista para un nuevo año, cada vez más cerca de mi meta de ser médico. Estoy poniéndome perfume cuando mi celular suena, corro a contestar. -Hola cariño – saludo a mi novio. -Hola Pequeña, ya estoy en la entrada de tu casa, apresúrate o no llegaremos a tiempo para la película. -Dame 5 minutos, tengo que termina de arreglarme. -Tienes 2 minutos. -Josh… -Uno cincuenta y ocho, uno y cincuenta y siete… -Vale, ahora bajo – corto la llamada aun riendo por sus ocurrencias. Cuando abro la puerta del auto mi aliento se escapa por la imagen. Mi sexy novio usa una camisa gris pegada a su cuerpo resaltando sus músculos, su espalda ancha y sus sexys brazos. Mi boca se seca al imaginar pasando mis dedos por debajo de su camisa, recorrer con mis labios esa suave piel bronceada. Dirijo mi mirada a su cuello y cuando llego a su rostro me encuentro con su sonrisa de satisfacción por atraparme inspeccionándolo. -¿Te gusta lo que ves? – me pregunta con tono de picardía, mientras yo me acomodo en el asiento del copiloto cerrando la puerta. -Ni te imaginas – le respondo guiñándole el ojo. -Pues todo esto es tuyo, solo tienes que tomarlo. -Paso, tengo la suficiente mercancía como para adquirir más – su sonrisa cayó al entender mi chiste de mal gusto. Y no pude evitar echarme a reír. -Eso no fue gracioso Alex – me miro seriamente – No deberías de hablar de otra \"mercancía\" refiriéndote a tus exnovios. No puedo contener la risa por más tiempo y suelto carcajadas más fuertes y el me mira con enojo – Dios Josh.. perdón…. Es que… eres tan gracioso cuando estas celoso – trato de calmarme – solo lo dije por molestarte no deberías celarme por tonterías como esa. -Y tú no deberías provocarme – me toma de los hombros – eres mía, recuérdalo. -Un momentito..- la ira empezó a inundarme, no quiero tener otra vez esta pelea pero él tiene que entender – deja de tratarme como si fuera un objeto de tu propiedad, sabes que no lo soporto. -Y tu deja de darme motivos para tener que demostrar que estás conmigo – arrancó el auto sin darme tiempo a salir de este. Es la misma pelea siempre, sus celos e inseguridades, no le he dado motivos para que desconfíe. Además odio que me trate como un objeto, diablos, soy una persona, no pertenezco a nadie. El camino al cine es en silencio. La tensión entre nosotros es tan evidente que podría cortarse con cuchillo. Entramos en el estacionamiento subterráneo, apenas Josh para el auto yo me bajo de él y empiezo a caminar hacia la salida. Escucho su grito llamarme, su voz tiene un tono de rabia y frustración. Hasta que me alcanza 5 autos más allá sosteniéndome del brazo. -Mierda Alex, ¿Por qué siempre tienes que actuar como una niña cuando discutimos? – se a lo que se refiere, cada vez que me enojo prefiero hacer el voto de silencio porque si algo he aprendido en esta vida es a no hablar cuando estoy enfadada, cuando lo he hecho digo cosas de las que luego me arrepiento. -¿Alex? – sigo si responder y el me sostiene de ambos hombros. -Déjame ir, Josh. -NO! – me grita, lo que me hace estremecer, no he conocido ese lado lleno de ira suyo – No te iras hasta que arreglemos esto. -No hay nada que arreglar Josh – le digo con tono neutro, deteniendo que las palabras que en verdad quiero decir salgan por mi boca – Estoy harta de esta maldita pelea, estoy harta de tus celos estúpidos, estoy harta de que me trates como un objeto de tu propiedad, me oyes… HARTA. -Entonces vamos a decirnos verdades – su mirada es más dura – Pues yo también estoy cansado de tu falta de sensibilidad, cansado de tener que soportar que tus exnovios se metan en nuestra relación, harto de que seas inmadura y no soluciones las peleas que tenemos… -Ja ja ja, yo siempre trato de entenderte, pero tú eres el que no madura y supera mi pasado – mi tono de voz es fuerte, por suerte no hay nadie a nuestro alrededor- además yo no me acosté con ninguno de mis exnovios a diferencia de tu señor-soy-tan-irresistible y si tan cansado estas, ¿Por qué diablos no me dejas en paz? ¿si no me soportas porque simplemente no te largas? -Ahí estas de nuevo, prefieres evitarlas cosas en lugar de enfrentarlas. -Me largo – gire soltándome de su agarre y tratando de continuar mi camino, cuando él me agarro y me cargo en su hombro. -Bájame Josh – patalee y lo golpee con mis puños pero él no me bajaba, me llevaba hacia el auto . -No hasta que te comportes con un poco de madurez. -Pues tú tampoco eres precisamente maduro Josh . -Deja de golpearme, no te voy a soltar – con su mano libre abre la puerta trasera del auto y me deja caer en él, debo decir que no muy sutilmente. Estoy recostada en el asiento trasero, Josh sube también y cierra la puerta – Ahora si vamos a arreglar las cosas. No tuve tiempo de captar sus movimientos hasta el momento en que sentí su cuerpo sobre el mío y su boca contra la mía en un beso duro. Me siento desconcertada por su reacción, espero gritos y más pelea pero no que me besara. Cuando su mano acaricia mi cadera y mi muslo, la ira se esfuma y es reemplazada por lujuria y deseo. Me dejo envolver por su pasión y correspondo a su beso con la misma intensidad. Sus labios abandonan los míos y atacan mi cuello con pequeños besos y mordiscos lo que me hace soltar un gemido. Mis manos se filtran por debajo de su camisa, lo que me recuerda que es exactamente lo que quería hacer cuando lo vi hoy, mis uñas se clavan en los músculos de su espalda cuando el succiona el lóbulo de mi oreja. Sus beso bajan hacia mi escote y mil sensaciones empiezan a cosquillear en mi vientre y sé que él también está lleno de deseo cuando el bulto de sus pantalones empuja mi muslo. Nos separamos de un salto cuando escuchamos un coche arrancar a unos pocos metros de nosotros. Nuestras respiraciones salen agitadas y tratan de apaciguarse. Josh junta nuestras frentes, mientras acaricia mi brazo. -Ahora si vamos a hablar, si vuelves a comportarte de esa manera tendré que tomar medidas más extremas. -¿Tratas de sobornarme? – le digo con picardía y ambos reímos. -No quiero, escúchame bien – me sostiene el rostro con ambas manos – No quiero que estemos mal, perdóname lo que dije, pero aun no puedo lidiar del todo bien con los celos. Mi corazón se revuelve ante su disculpa – Yo también lo lamento, no es solo tu culpa, yo tengo mucho que ver en nuestras peleas… Me interrumpe poniendo un dedo sobre mis labios – Puede ser, pero tú no me has dado motivos para que yo desconfíe y tienes razón en enojarte por tratarte como un objeto, es solo que no quiero perderte. -No lo harás – su mirada refleja cariño y hace estremecer a mi corazón – soy solo tuya – ante mi declaración me besa suavemente. -Sabes – susurra en mi oído – lo mejor de las peleas son las reconciliaciones, antes no lo creía pero después de lo de hace un rato, empecé a ser creyente. Nuestra sesión de besos duro un poco más antes de que finalmente entremos a una sala de cine. Olvidamos nuestra riña y disfrutamos de la película y la compañía. Salimos tomados de la mano y nos sentamos en una mesa en una heladería frente al cine. El silencio en nosotros se propaga, aunque debo admitir que no es un silencio incomodo todo lo contrario, es un silencio divertido, sobretodo cuando veo a Josh mirarme sugestivamente moviendo sus cejas mientras con su lengua lame su helado muy sugestivamente. Las carcajadas se me escaparon tan fuerte que todo el mundo a nuestro alrededor giro para verme. Siento mi cara arder aunque mis risas no paran. -Eres….. un..payaso – le digo a Josh aun si poder dejar de reir – Ves.. lo que.. oca..ocasionas -Yo no tengo la culpa – me dice Josh fingiendo estar ofendido – yo debería estar enojado por burlarte de mi lengua -Pues tú y tu lengua son completamente ridículos – me hace señas para que me acerque a él y cuando lo hago susurra a mi oído -No te burles de mi lengua, porque ella puede querer venganza, y sabes lo que te puede hacer …- cuando niego con la cabeza él continua – pues puede mostrarte el camino al cielo y dejarte en medio camino, si sabes a lo que me refiero. Josh se aleja y me guiña un ojo pícaramente. Mi cara sigue ardiendo y cuando estoy apunto de responderle unas chicas nos interrumpen. -Oh por Dios! – grita la rubia número uno, que por cierto trae un escote muy provocativo y se inclina hacia Josh mostrándoles sus…..atributos. Mi sangre empieza a hervir – Eres Josh Hutcherson! -No puedo creerlo! – chilla la rubia número 2. -Pues sí es él – les digo luego de aclarar mi garganta, ellas me ignoran y regresan su atención a mi novio. -Debes darnos tu autógrafo por favor – le pide la rubia 2. -Debes tomarte una foto conmigo – pide la rubia 1 tomándole de la mano haciéndole ponerse de pie. Josh me mira ceñudo y yo le doy un asentimiento. Debo acostumbrarme a su fama y a sr perseguido por fans, aunque estas sean más bonitas que yo. -Voy al baño cariño – le digo mientras ese par están sobre el con sus celulares y una libreta. En el baño me lavo la cara tratando de serenarme. No debo desconfiar de él... Es su vida y él tampoco me ha dado motivos para sentirme celosa. Yo le he pedido que deje esas escenitas y yo tengo que hacer lo mismo con él. Después de todo la confianza es tan importante como el amor en una relación. ¿He dicho amor? Mierda… no se qué me pasa, en verdad debo controlar mis sentimientos, esas palabra ronda mi cabeza cada vez mas. Aún es demasiado pronto para sentir eso, debe ser que me encariñado mucho con él por eso es que estoy confundida. Si eso es, lo quiero mucho. Salgo del baño y cuando levanto mi mirada veo a Josh besando a rubia 1. Mi corazón se detuvo, literalmente. Mi aliento se quedó atrapado y un nudo en mi garganta, del tamaño de un balón, se formó. Reaccione unos segundos después cuando esa zorra soltó a mi novio. Por suerte tenía mi bolso conmigo, así que salí rápidamente de la heladería. Hice señas a un taxi para que parara, pero todos estaban ocupados. Por el vidrio de la heladería vi que Josh me buscaba y nuestras miradas se encontraron. El entendimiento de que yo lo había visto cruzo por sus ojos y trato de salir detrás de mí. Por suerte las rubias se atravesaron en su camino lo que le impidió avanzar a mí rápidamente. Debía escapar de ahí y ningún maldito taxi paraba. Vi un autobús estacionarse a 10 pasos de donde me encontraba y decidir subir en él. Cuando Josh salió a la calle no me encontró. Pude ver su desesperación mientras el autobús avanzaba y yo lo perdía de vista. Mis ojos picaban pero no dejaría que las lágrimas salgan. No aquí. Tuve que retener varios sollozos antes de llamar a una persona con quien necesitaba desahogarme. Marque su número y al tercer timbrazo contesto. -¿Alex? -Necesito verte, por favor. En veinte minutos te espero en Boccati – era un pequeño bar de comida rápida cerca de casa. -Claro, ahí estaré. HOOOOOOLA A TODOS... ESPERO Q LES GUSTE ESTE NUEVO CAPÍTULO :) TARDARÉ UN POCO EN ACTUALIZAR PORUE EN VERDAD ANDO APRETADA CON LA UNIVERSIDAD. PERO PROMETO HACERLO LO MAS PRONTO POSIBLE.. GRACIAS POR SUS REVIEWS Y MS¿NS.. REUCERDEN DEJARME SUS RECOMENDACION DE CANCIONES Q PODRIA USAR MAS ADELTANTE.. - 3 MILET AVANCE: Siempre que pienso en ella junto a mí y un \"para siempre\" no puedo evitar sentir que es todo lo que necesito. Amo actuar, amo mi vida, amo a mi familia, pero desde que la conocí siento que encontré una parte de mí, que no sabía que faltaba, pero que siempre fue necesaria; tan necesaria que ya no puedo vivir sin ella. Ella es todo para mí. Mil veces me maldigo por ser tan cobarde y no decirle que la amo con todo mi ser. Este miedo que siento a que ella no sienta lo mismo no me deja de perseguir, tengo terror de que si le digo lo que siento se asuste y me deje; moriría sin duda, prefiero tenerla de cualquier manera que no tenerla en absoluto.[Chapter 33] Capítulo 33 Hoy era un día perfecto, obviando la pelea con mi novia, pero la reconciliación fue exquisita; hasta que estas chicas se atravesaron. Mi novia había ido al baño mientras yo firmaba autógrafos y posaba para fotos con estas chicas. -Si yo fuera tu novia, no te dejaría tan solito- comento una de las rubias, que por cierto traía una blusa muy escotada y me daba la impresión de que trataba de provocarme. -No me dejo solo, solo fue al baño – le respondí tratando de que no me clave sus uñas rojas en mi cuello. -Pues yo no te perdería de vista – dijo acercándose a mí, envolviendo sus brazos en mi cuello – te cuidaría por lo que otras chicas pudieran hacerte, dejara en claro que eres mío – me susurraba en el oído – solo mío. No me dio tiempo para responder cuando sus labios estuvieron sobre los míos. Su acto me tomo por sorpresa y tarde unos instantes en reaccionar y alejarla de mí. Su sonrisa de coqueta me lleno de ira. No tenía palabras, pero si tenía un mal presentimiento, cuando vi a la rubia intentar besarme de nuevo la sostuve por lo brazos, busque con la mirada a mi novia y la encontré fuera de la heladería con una mirada de dolor. Mi cuerpo reaccionó y empecé a ir tras ella, no podía permitir que tuviera una idea errónea de lo que paso. Cuando avanzaba hacia la salida la rubia se atravesó en mi camino. -Tan pronto te vas mi amor – dijo poniendo su dedo en mi pecho – puedes llevarme a donde quieras si deseas otra probadita de mí – su comentario me dio asco, así que aparte su mano y trate de avanzar, pero siguió atravesándose. -Te juro que si no fueras mujer te partiría la cara – y la parte violentamente. Cuando salí a la calle no encontré a Alex. Mi cuerpo empezó a temblar por el sentimiento de impotencia. No puedo creer que esto esté pasando, no puedo perderla de esta manera tan estúpida. Necesito encontrarla, necesito que me escuche, necesito que confíe en mí. Llamo a su celular que me envía a buzón de mensajes, quiero buscarla pero no tengo idea de en qué dirección empezar. Mi mente se nubla, la desesperación no me deja pensar, no sé qué diablos hacer, ni a quien llamar. Decido ir por mi auto y buscarla en su casa. Cuando llego allí en un record de tiempo, espero no tener multas de tránsito, me doy cuenta que la casa está vacía. Los padres de Alex aún deben estar trabajando y ella o debe estar adentro y no me quiere abrir, o aún no llega a casa, si mi suerte es así de buena podre esperarla hasta que llegue y antes de que, conociendo su carácter, me cierre la puerta en mi cara. La oscuridad de la noche cae a mí alrededor y mi desesperación también va en aumento, sofocándome, haciendo que mi corazón se acelera y se detenga al mismo tiempo. Eso sucede cuando tengo miedo, y en este caso perderla es mi peor pesadilla. Siempre que pienso en ella junto a mí y un \"para siempre\" no puedo evitar sentir que es todo lo que necesito. Amo actuar, amo mi vida, amo a mi familia, pero desde que la conocí siento que encontré una parte de mí, que no sabía que faltaba, pero que siempre fue necesaria; tan necesaria que ya no puedo vivir sin ella. Ella es todo para mí. Mil veces me maldigo por ser tan cobarde y no decirle que la amo con todo mi ser. Este miedo que siento a que ella no sienta lo mismo no me deja de perseguir, tengo terror de que si le digo lo que siento se asuste y me deje; moriría sin duda, prefiero tenerla de cualquier manera que no tenerla en absoluto. Incluso si ella hubiera elegido a Darío, me conformaría con su amistad siempre y cuando me pertenezca de alguna manera, y por lo mismo no puedo perderla de esta estúpida manera. Miro 2 figuras acercarse hacia la casa. Se detienen al notar la presencia de mi auto. Mi corazón late desbocado y sé que es ella. Está con alguien a su lado, mis celos empiezan a calentar mi sangre cuando pienso que puede ser Darío. Ella no pudo haber acudido a él cuando tenemos problemas. Mis manos se vuelven puños, pero me relajo cuando me doy cuenta que es Santiago. Ellos caminan rápidamente hacia la entrada de la casa de mi novia. Salgo a su encuentro rápidamente cerrando con fuerza la puerta del auto. Ella se apresura a despedirse y trata desesperadamente de abrir su puerta cuando la alcanzo. La tomo del brazo mientras pronuncio su nombre, ella se zafa bruscamente de mi agarre, haciendo que mi corazón caiga en mil pedazos. -Alex por favor… - le suplico casi en un susurro. Pero su silencio me hace continuar – Por favor, escúchame, yo no tuve nada que ver con que ella me besará. -Si como no – el dolor y el sarcasmo en su respuesta fue como un golpe directo en mi estómago – no tuviste que ver nada cuando tus labios y los de ella se devoraban los del otro, ¿verdad? -No es así, Alex. Te lo juro, ella me beso, me tomo desprevenido, cuando reaccione tú ya te habías ido. -¿Y qué suponías que hiciera? ¿Quedarme a ver como \"mi novio\" me engañaba con una rubia oxigenada en mis narices? Perdóname si mi dignidad no me permite complacerte – otro golpe directamente en mi cara. -Alex, por favor… - logró abrir la puerta, pero se detiene de entrar ante mi súplica- confía en mí, no puedo perderte…. Por un momento nos quedamos en silencio. Mi corazón latía tan fuerte que casi podría estar seguro de que ella lo escuchaba. Tomó aire y habló – Solo vete Josh, ahora no puedo hablar contigo, no es un buen momento, no quiero decir cosas de las que luego me puedo arrepentir.. -Alex, no… - no puedo permitir que se vaya sin escucharme, cuando siento la mano de alguien detenerme. Santiago me mira con comprensión, no me había dado cuenta que aún estaba aquí. Él y Alex intercambiaron una mirada, de esas que son como conversaciones, la consecuencia de su amistad desde siempre. Una punzada de envidia me nace al sentir que él la conoce más que yo. Con un asentimiento hacia él y una mirada de dolor hacia mí, Alex cerró la puerta haciendo que mi corazón caiga cuando el golpe de esta sonó. Sentía que mi mundo se venía abajo, me sentía tan impotente por permitirlo. -Debes darle su espacio – la voz de Santy me saco de mis pensamientos – la conozco, ella te está dando una oportunidad, solo necesita calmarse y pensarlo… si la presionas harás que reaccione mal y una decisión apresurada e impulsiva no creo que te guste. -No puedo permitir que piense que la engañé… no puede dejarme… -Tranquilo, ella recapacitará, en serio… recuerda que la conozco mejor que tú aunque te duela, cuando ella esta disgustada es mejor dejarla que lo consulte con su almohada eso la hará razonar – suelto un suspiro – si ella estuviera segura de que tuviste la culpa te hubiera mandado al diablo y creéme que no quieres ser el que reciba toda su ira. -La quiero… -Lo sé, amigo – con su brazo me guío a mi auto – ahora ve a casa, veras que mañana todo se arreglará, confía en mí. Y confío en él. Enciendo mi auto y empiezo a regresar a casa con mi corazón destrozado. En el camino recuerdo el bar donde estuve la ocasión en que Alex me invito a ver una película a su casa. Esa vez no me emborrache, pero ahora creo que lo necesito. Por suerte mis abuelos no están en casa y no tengo que preocuparme en darles dolores de cabeza. Entro al bar con mis gafas y mi gorro. Me siento en la barra y pido una botella de whisky. Trato de dejar mi mente en blanco pero fracaso inútilmente. Casi sin darme cuenta he bebido casi toda la botella. Mi cabeza empieza a zumbar y mi estómago a revolverse. Tomo mi celular y marco su número, aún tengo la esperanza de que me conteste, de que me diga que todo estará bien, que todo este dolor estúpido se ira… al quinto timbrazo me contesta. -¿Qué quieres Josh? Te pedí que me dejes en paz. -Pues no… t…te de… dejaré en .. paz, hasta que me escucheeeeees. -Diablos Josh, ¿estas ebrio?- empiezo a soltar carcajadas por su deducción, pero mi risa tiene más sarcasmo e ironía que diversión. -Pues creo… que es lo más probable luego deeeee… una botella de whisky – y considerando el despecho con el que bebí, por lo roto de mi corazón. -Mierda Josh, ¿en que estabas pensando? – escucho como camina por su habitación – dime en donde estas. -Pues estaba pensando en que quería olvidar el dolor que siento por que no me quieres escuchar – no sé cómo pude decir esto sin balbucear – quería olvidar el dolor que siento con la posibilidad de perderte y…. estoy en un bar. -Es obvio de que estas en un bar, lo que quiero saber es la dirección - su voz sonaba exasperada. -Puesssssss, no lo sé. -Mierda, dale tu celular a un camarero. -¿Y si no quiero? -MIERDA JOSH! HAZ LO QUE TE DIGO. -Ok, no te enojes – le hago señas al camarero que me sirvió el whisky, veo como habla con ella y luego de un momento me regresa mi celular. No sé cuánto tiempo ha pasado cuando llamo al camarero – Por favor, quiero otra botella – pido cuando termine lo que faltaba de la otra. -No puedo, la señorita me pidió que no te diera de beber más y creo que es lo mejor, usted está en muy malas condiciones. -Pues no me importa, dame otra, si a ella le importará lo que me pueda suceder no me apartara de su lado, me dejaría explicarle, me creería, confiaría en mí… - prácticamente balbucee lo último – dame otra botella… -Basta Josh – su voz casi hace que me caiga de mi asiento – Nos vamos, ahora. Ella se acercó a mí. Tomo mi billetera y pago por el whisky que había bebido. No pude quitar mi mirada de ella. Cuando ella se dio cuenta de que la estaba mirando me hablo – No pensarás que yo iba a pagar por eso. Negué con la cabeza – No, no era eso… ¿Qué haces aquí? -A diferencia de lo que dijiste en tu patético discurso de borracho, si me importa lo que te pueda suceder – uhhh ese fue un golpe directo en la boca del estómago. Se acercó a mí y paso mi brazo alrededor de sus hombros y me ayudo a ponerme de pie. Salimos del bar, ella prácticamente arrastrándome aunque trate de facilitarle el trabajo. Llegamos al estacionamiento y mientras ella abría las puertas del auto y me ayudaba a acomodarme en el asiento del pasajero note que usaba ropa deportiva. Su cabello estaba recogido en un moño alto lo que dejaba que el aroma de su perfume se filtre por mis sentidos. Me puso el cinturón de seguridad, cerró mi puerta y fue hacia su asiento. Salimos del estacionamiento, no me importaba a donde me llevará, lo importante es que ella está aquí, conmigo. -¿tus abuelos están en casa? – Cuando negué con la cabeza ella continuó - ¿tienes llaves de tu casa? Asentí. Ella no dijo nada más y eso dolió mucho más aun – Alex, yo… -Shhh, no digas nada Josh, ya llegamos a tu casa – evidentemente ella tomo mis llaves de la guantera y abrió el garaje. Guardo el auto y me ayudo a bajar. Prácticamente me arrastro hasta mi habitación. Me condujo directamente al baño cuando se dio cuenta de que tenía nauseas. Me coloco frente al inodoro y me dejo solo. Mientras regresaba el contenido de mi estómago, ella estaba de vuelta con una toalla la cual mojaba y la ponía en mi frente. Debo admitir que eso ayudó mucho, los paños y el hecho de que ella estuviera a mi lado. Después de que mi estómago estuviera completamente vacío ella me alejo del inodoro y limpio mi boca. Empezó a quitarme la camisa, por lo que me resulto gracioso, al darse cuenta de mi diversión, negó con la cabeza. -Más vale que quites esa tonta sonrisa, y te metas en la bañera – señalo la tina llena de agua, no me di cuenta cuando la había preparado. -Moriré de hipotermia si entro allí – espeté. - El agua esta tibia, suficiente para hacerte reaccionar sin que tengas frío – logró sacarme mi camiseta - ¿crees que puedas sacarte tus pantalones tú mismo? Negué con la cabeza, disfrutando cada momento, sabía que podía hacerlo pero disfrutaba ponerla en este aprieto. Ella soltó un suspiro de frustración y se acercó a mí, que ahora estaba sentado sobre la tapa del inodoro. Sus dedos temblaban cuando desabrochaba el botón de mi pantalón. Luego me quito mis zapatos y calcetines y mis pantalones. Ahí estaba yo, solo en bóxer frente a la chica que más deseo, en otra situación ella también estaría sin ropa a esta altura. Pero ver su ceño fruncido me muestra lo enfadada o preocupada, no puedo saber qué mismo, está en este momento. -Métete en la bañera, no pienso ayudarte en eso, dejaré ropa en tu cama para que puedas cambiarte e iré a la cocina a preparar café – empezó a salir del baño. -Alex, yo… -Ahora no es el momento Josh. -¿Y cuándo será el momento? -No lo sé, pero no es ahora, así que metete en esa bañera - y así se fue dejándome solo. Definitivamente el baño me cayó de maravilla. Ya no estaba tambaleándome al caminar y pude vestirme y recostarme para cuando ella volvió. Trajo consigo café y galletitas saladas. Dejo la bandeja en la mesita junto a mi cama y se acercó a mí. Aun no me hablaba y evitaba mi mirada deliberadamente. Me ayudo a sentarme acomodando almohadas detrás de mí. Me paso el café y las galletitas saladas. -¿Éstas segura de que no lo voy a devolver? -No tranquilo, la cafeína te hará estar más alerta y te quitará el vértigo y las galletitas ayudaran a calmar tu estómago. Mañana cuando despiertes deberás tomar 2 aspirinas las deje en el escritorio para que las tomes – estuvo en silencio mientras terminaba mi refrigerio, luego puso nuevamente la taza en la mesita – Es mejor que duermas, ahora me tengo que ir. La tome del brazo cuando disponía a ponerse de pie – No te vayas… por favor.. – ella me dio una mirada de angustia, tire de ella hacia mí y susurré en su oído – Por favor, Quédate… -No puedo Josh, me salí a escondidas de mi casa, cuando mis papás despierten y no me encuentren estaré en graves problemas. -Si se dan cuenta, les dices que salimos a correr como lo hacemos todas las mañanas, por favor Alex, no quiero estar solo, no te quiero lejos de mí sin que solucionemos las cosas… -Ahora no es el momento para hablar Josh.. -Lo sé, mañana hablaremos, ahora solo quiero tenerte conmigo, por favor – ante mi petición ella se quitó sus zapatos. Me hice a un lado haciéndole espacio y levante las cobijas para que pueda meterse dentro de ellas. Alex dudo un poco pero se acostó de espaldas a mí. Puse mi brazo para que lo usara como almohada y envolví el otro alrededor de su cintura atrayéndola a mi cuerpo. Tenía miedo de que se resistiera o me alejara pero no lo hizo, así que me aferre a ella como si mi vida dependiera de ello. Cada parte de mi cuerpo que estaba en contacto con el de ella quemaba, no había ningún espacio entre nosotros y aun así no era suficiente. No había nada sexual en este tipo de contacto, era más íntimo que eso, era un estado de paz y felicidad a pesar de nuestra actual situación. Sentí como mi respiración se volvía suave y rítmica al igual que la de ella, mis ojos se cerraban y antes de que cayera en los brazos de Morfeo le susurré. -Quédate conmigo…. Hola a tod s.. actualice mas pronto xq termine un nuevo capítulo :) gracias por seguir leyendo, por sus reviews y mensajes. espero sus comentarios y sugerencias de música y sobre que quisieran que pase e la historia. pueden ver que tienen problemas como todas las parejas. no todo es color de rosa. cuando su relación se solidifique vendrá lo bueno :) AVANCE: -No, no te prometo – me mira seriamente – prefiero que me insultes, que me golpees, pero no me alejes, créeme que no me importaría recibir todo esa mierda con tal de no sentir que me quieres lejos… -Josh…[Chapter 34] Capítulo 34 La luz empieza a filtrarse bajo mis párpados, y mi cuerpo se siente tan cómodo y relajado que no quiero despertar. Abro mis ojos cuando los recuerdos de lo sucedido anoche vienen a mí. Encuentro a Josh mirándome fijamente, mí impulso es de sonreír, pero recuerdo que estoy enfadada, no tanto como ayer, así que la reprimo. El acaricia mi mejilla con sus dedos. -Esto es lo quiero para mi vida – sus dedos bajan a mi mentón y acarician mis labios – despertar todos los días contigo en mi brazos, que seas lo último que vea en la noche y lo primero que mire en la mañana…. No respondo. Aún estoy enfadada con él, no por el beso. Luego de reflexionar me di cuenta que él no tuvo la culpa, soy mujer y mi sexto sentido sabe que esa rubia oxigenada se metió con él. Pero si me molesta que haya bebido hasta la ebriedad y más que todo su discurso donde dudo que yo me preocupe por él. Toma mi rostro en sus manos y se acerca para besarme. Me es difícil resistirme, pero no quiero hacerlo, porque si lo beso me perderé en él y nunca aclararemos esto, no podemos dejarlo pasar; pongo mi mano sobre mi boca y al notar el dolor que cruza su mirada, doy la excusa más estúpida. -Aliento mañanero – su rostro se relaja un poco, y creo que cayó en mi mentira, la verdad es que no me siento fuerte para besarle. -Eso no me importa, solo quiero sentirte aquí conmigo – su dedo se enreda en uno de mis rizos. -Por si no te has dado cuenta estamos en una misma cama. -Sabes que no es eso a lo que me refiero – su mirada seria me hace suspirar – necesito saber que estamos bien, que estamos juntos. Que estas aquí porque quieres, diablos, porque me quieres. -Te quiero, eso no lo puedo cambiar – el cerro sus ojos cuando admití que lo quería y yo me sentía como una gran imbécil – No es algo que tenga un botón de apagado. -Por favor, por favor, por favor, necesito que estemos bien, necesito que me creas que yo no quería besarla, necesito que creas que lo que siento por ti es más grande que yo, pero es sincero…. Nunca, te haría daño. -Lo sé… - su suspiro de alivio me inunda pero en sus ojos veo miedo, y la verdad es que soy yo la que debería disculparse por siempre actuar de forma impulsiva y no aclarar las cosas, pero la verdad es que yo soy así… prefiero apartar a la gente para no decir cosas que luego me arrepentiré, pero las palabras quedan atrapadas en mi garganta. Me acerco a él y lo beso. Le toma solo un segundo en devolverme el beso. Es dulce, tímido, como esos primeros besos en lo que temes hacer algo malo. El acaricia mi mejilla y yo paso mis palmas por toda su espalda. Sus labios dejan los míos y mi cuello recibe toda su atención ahora. Deja pequeños mordiscos y lametones que me vuelven loca y hace que mi temperatura se eleve. -Josh, basta – digo riéndome - me haces cosquillas. -Amo tu risa – me dice besando el escote de mi camiseta en V. tomo su rostro en mis manos y lo acerco para que me mire. -Lo siento, perdóname por actuar así, pero esta soy yo, tengo toda esta mierda de carácter, pero créeme cuando te digo que nunca pensé que me engañaste, solo estaba molesta por la idea de otra chica besándote – el me besa la nariz – Cuando me cierre de esa manera otra vez, no pienses que te voy a dejar, solo necesito tiempo para pensar, no quiero decir o hacer cosas que luego me arrepentiré solo por rabia… prométeme que me darás mi espacio. -No, no te prometo – me mira seriamente – prefiero que me insultes, que me golpees, pero no me alejes, créeme que no me importaría recibir todo esa mierda con tal de no sentir que me quieres lejos… -Josh… -No Alex, para eso estoy aquí, para querernos, para comprendernos... Es obvio que tendremos peleas, pero son cosas que debemos superar, así que tú prométeme que no me alejarás en una próxima ocasión – no sé qué decirle, son estas cosas las que me hacen amarlo, que me hacen quererlo. Al ver que no responde empieza a besarme de nuevo en el escote provocándome cosquillas y mi risa no se hace esperar – Promételo Alex o te harás pipi por las cosquillas que te haré. -Basta Josh… para… para, por favor – sus manos acarician mis costillas y en verdad estoy a punto de hacerme pipi – Ok, te lo prometo… pero, para... por favor. Sus manos se detienen y trato de controlar mi respiración. Su sonrisa se hace evidente y su cuerpo se cierne sobre mí. Decido hacer algo, tengo que castigarlo por las cosquillas. Paso mis brazos por sus hombros y lo atraigo a mí. Beso su mandíbula y mordisqueo su oreja. Él suelta un bufido de placer y sé que voy por buen camino. Deslizo mi mano por debajo de su camiseta sin dejar de besarlo. Acaricio sus abdominales y deslizo mi mano por la pretina de su pantalón. Suelta un gemido que lo sofoca en mi cuello. Sus brazos me atraen hacia él. Sigo acariciando sus músculos y un bulto se forma en sus pantalones. No sé por qué, ni como tengo la valentía para hacerlo, pero lo hago. Meto mi mano por debajo de su ropa interior y acaricio su miembro. La respiración de Josh se entrecorta y los gemidos que salen de su garganta hacen que mi emoción crezca. Sus manos bajan a mis caderas y las sostiene firmes a cada lado. Sus labios juegan con mi oreja y cada gemido de su garganta acaricia mi rostro. Su miembro se endurece bajo mi mano, lo acaricio en toda su longitud, mi mano viaja de arriba abajo y siento como su dureza crece aún más. Hecha su cabeza hacia atrás, con sus ojos cerrados y es cuando aprovecho y mis labios caen en su cuello. Luego de un pequeño mordisco y succión mi trabajo está hecho. Acelero el movimiento de mi mano hasta que sus gemidos son constantes y su pulso se siente en mis dedos. Luego de un par de caricias más, su miembro expulsa su semen derramándose en mi mano a la vez que un sonido gutural sale de su garganta, resultado de haber llegado al orgasmo. Sus brazos caen a cada lado y su respiración agitada trata de normalizarse. Retiro mi mano de su erección y me acomodo en la cama a su lado. Por un momento solo se escuchó su respiración, hasta que él rompe el silencio. -Eso fue excelente – se acomoda cerniéndose sobre mí – gracias mi niña, eso ha sido el orgasmo más excitante, maravilloso y perfecto que he tenido - mis mejillas se calientan y deja besos en todo mi rostro – Me siento tan mal por no regresarte el favor, pero si me dejas puedo hacerlo. -No – le digo deteniéndolo cuando se abalanzaba sobre mi boca – No es el momento pequeño, necesito llegar a mi casa. -Por favor, por favor, por favor, por favor… - parece un niño pequeño cuando hace esos pucheros y me mira con ojitos del gato de Shrek. -Noooo – me envuelvo en su cuello y lo atraigo para besarlo, él se deja llevar. Amo el peso de su cuerpo sobre el mío – Mas te conviene que yo no esté en problemas por venir a tu rescate. -Gracias por eso – sus labios se pegan a mi frente – no sabía que otra cosa hacer, pero me alegra que me buscarás, me hace sentir que en verdad te importo.. -Josh, tú me importas y mucho... Nunca lo dudes. – y otra vez mas estamos envueltos en apasionados besos. Giramos en la cama, en momentos yo encima de él y en otros lo contrario. Solo un segundo sentí la caída. El golpe sordo del cuerpo de Josh contra el piso y yo sobre él. Rei por su cara de dolor – No me mires así Josh, fue tu culpa por no controlar esas hormonas. -Nada de eso señorita, mis hormonas se alborotan porque tú las provocas. -Claro, culpa a la chica que te da un orgasmo para saciar tus deseos. -Eso es diferente – dice girándonos en el piso, ahora él sobre mí – cuando hagamos el amor todo será perfecto, no será por un ataque de hormonas alborotadas, será porque es el momento adecuado, porque nos…..- amemos, amor, eso diría yo. No puedo evitar la sensación de felicidad cuando él dijo \"hagamos el amor\" no simplemente sexo. No me siento lo suficientemente valiente para decirle cuanto lo amo, así que simplemente lo beso una vez más entreteniéndome con su labio inferior. -No me provoques Alex. No sé si pueda detenerme si llegamos muy lejos. -¿Y qué si quiero provocarte? ¿y qué si no quiero que te detengas? – le sonrío con picardía. -Te encanta jugar con fuego – susurra contra mi cuello – Pero no lo dices en serio ¿verdad? Me mantengo en silencio disfrutando su rostro de súplica. La verdad es que la idea de él y yo juntos cada vez es más atractiva – No, por ahora. Lo giro sobre su cuerpo y me pongo de pie – Es hora de que me vaya. -Espera, me doy una ducha y nos vamos. Tenemos que aprovechar nuestro últimos días – lo que me hace recordar que en 2 días Josh viajará de nuevo a su vida sin mí. Trato de que no se me note la tristeza, así que simplemente asiento. Él me abraza y yo me refugio en sus brazos. Miro nuestro reflejo en el espejo de su armario. Cuando él estira su cuello para besarme la frente miro el gran trabajo que hice en su cuello y hecho a reír con grandes carcajadas. Josh se separa y me mira con incredulidad, sigue mi mirada hacia el espejo y nota el motivo de mi diversión. Se mira en el espejo más de cerca y yo trato de reprimirme: él me mira a través del espejo con una mirada seria, por un momento tengo miedo de que se enfade, pero cuando su mirada se vuelve divertida me relajo. Se acerca a mí y me toma por la cintura y nuevamente me está haciendo cosquillas. -¿Crees que es divertido? Ahora tendrán que ponerme maquillaje para disimular tremendo chupetón. -Para Josh, por favor… - las cosquillas siempre me descontrolan, pero el deja de hacerme reír y me aprieta hacia él. -Eres muy inteligente mi pequeña celosa. Ni siquiera sé cuándo lo hiciste – su risa es contagiosa - Marcarme como vaca, no lo puedo creer. Pero bueno, eso demuestra que estamos en la misma onda, las grandes mentes piensan igual. -¿A qué te refieres? – le miro incrédula. El me arrastra hacia el espejo y tomándome del mentón gira mi cuello hacia un lado. Justo en la base de mi cuello está un tremendo chupetón. La sonrisa se extiende por su cara y yole doy un golpe en su brazo. -Auch..! eso dolió, ahora también tendré un morado ahí. -No tenías derecho Josh, ¿Cómo pudiste hacerlo? ¿Qué les diré a mis papis? ¿Cómo mierda lo taparé? Odio las bufandas. -Te lo merecías, señorita-excito-a-mi-novio-para-marcarlo-como-vaca -sin-que-se-de-cuenta. -Dios… como te odio, más te vale conseguirme maquillaje antes de que me lleves a casa. Luego de un guiño, entro en su baño. Cuando salió con una toalla envuelta en sus caderas el muy cínico la dejo caer y se vistió en mi frente. Obviamente cubrí mis ojos. Pero sus comentarios picaros me hicieron reír. Cuando volví a casa tuve suerte que mis papis, creyeran que fui a correr con Josh. Un problema menos. Pasamos los siguientes 2 días juntos, la mayor cantidad de tiempo posible. Y como tradición el último día fuimos a nuestro escondite a las afuera de la ciudad. Permanecimos abrazados mientras la oscuridad nos abrazaba. Josh consiguió anillos hechos de un material parecido a la madera, donde estaban grabados nuestros nombres. Y tal como en las bodas, cada uno coloco un anillo al otro, como señal de promesa. Lo acompañe hasta el aeropuerto de la capital como la última vez. Josh compro mi boleto de vuelta, para cuando él se embarcara para regresar a EEUU. La prensa nos sorprendió nuevamente pero Josh no dio declaraciones. La despedida fue igual de dura como la última vez. Ahora ya no tenía miedo de que lo nuestro se acabara cuando él se vaya. Ahora el dolor era provocado por la anticipación a extrañarle. El beso de despedida fue tierno, dulce y lleno de promesas. Hubo lágrimas de mi parte cuando lo perdía de vista en el túnel de abordaje. Hubo lágrimas de mi parte cuando regresaba a mi casa. Pero también hubo sonrisas por los recuerdos de los bellos momentos que vivimos este verano, no cambiaría nada de lo que hemos vivido, ni siquiera las peleas. Dos días después, Josh y yo pudimos hablar. Él estaba instalado leyendo otros guiones para sus nuevos proyectos y yo estaba lista para regresar a clases. Josh prometió venir a la boda de mi hermano la semana antes del estreno de CF, aunque no quería complicarle las cosas, la esperanza de verlo antes de lo estimado lleno de felicidad mi corazón. En la red había nueva información sobre Josh y yo. Empezando por videos de su baile cuando recién llego al inicio del verano hasta fotos de él llegando a su país, donde para mala suerte se notaba mi chupetón dando a la prensa puerta abierta para especulaciones sobre nuestra vida íntima. Ya no era tan incómodo ver noticias sobre mí. Me doy cuenta que la vida del espectáculo es así de complicada, cada día nuevos chismes, criticas. Lo único que importa es que se quién es Josh y que ante todo debo confiar en él. También el hecho de que todo mundo sepa nuestra relación me hace sentir más segura de nuestra relación. Por lo menos tengo más certeza de que todo es real. HOLAAA..! actualice temprano xq ultimamente me han dado atacazos escribir. tengo una nueva visión de como irá la historia. por el momento todo será feliz, pero recuerden que no todo dura x siempre..! gracias por sus reviews y mensajes. gracias por compartir la historia :) solo les aviso que para el final falta muchisisisimo, no podemos ponerlas tan fácil a los protagonistas verdad? les comento que ya encontré una canción preciosa que Josh dedicará a Alex. espero que la busquen y me digan que opinan. se llama: Estaciones - Pacho Marchan Y como ven su relación se torna un poco Hot :) ahora Josh regresará a su vida, pero como lo que nos interesa es su relación resumiré en un capítulo el tiempo que le toma volver :) espero sus reviews, comentarios, recomendacione... AVANCE: -Josh, estas descuidando tu trabajo, apenas tienes tiempo para descansar y viajas para estar con ella. No estas prestando la atención necesaria a tu vida, prácticamente vives por ella. Me preocupa que te enfermes, además….. No sé qué responder, por un lado me siento furioso porque sé que ella piensa que lo de Alex es pasajero y no puede ver que en verdad estoy feliz - Además ¿qué? -Necesito saber si se están cuidando, Josh. No es momento para que tengas un hijo. No eres lo suficientemente maduro para ser padre, dañaría tu vida, tu carrera. Sé que siempre tomas tus precauciones, pero estas tan cegado que tengo miedo que quedes atrapado en algo que no quieres…. - Milet 3[Chapter 35] Capítulo 35 Llegue a Kentucky casi a las dos de la mañana. Les dije a mis padres que no era necesario que me recogieran, pero aun así fueron por mí al aeropuerto. Es muy bueno estar en casa con mi familia, en verdad los he extrañado… Mucho pero nada comparado con el sentimiento por estar lejos de Alex. Fui un cobarde en no decirle que la amo. Me prometí a mí mismo decirle aunque ella no sienta lo mismo, trataría con todas mis fuerzas que ese sentimiento crezca en ella; pero fui muy cobarde y no lo hice. Amo mi país, amo mi trabajo, amo a mi familia, pero nada se compara a lo que siento por ella. Quisiera dejarlo todo por estar a su lado, tengo el dinero suficiente para tener una buena vida con ella, pero no sé cómo reaccionaría ella si se lo propusiera. Por eso quiero estar seguro de sus sentimientos por mí. Porque yo quiero sacrificarme, no quiero que ella deje a su familia y a su vida que la hacen feliz, pero yo si la amo como para dejar todo por ella. Me revuelvo en mi cama, la luz se filtra por la ventana. Miro el reloj que está en mi parador y veo que ya es medio día. Aunque quiera no puedo seguir durmiendo. Estas últimas noches han sido muy largas. Me aferro a los recuerdos de ella entre mis brazos. ¿Cómo pude acostumbrarme con solo una noche a su cuerpo y el mío juntos? Espero poder volver a dormir cómodamente, aunque sé que eso es imposible, ninguna cama, ninguna otra cosas hará que esa experiencia sea superada. El haber dormido con ella. Que ambos despertáramos en los brazos del otro es algo incomparable y aún más íntimo que si hubiéramos tenido sexo. Decido levantarme. Salgo hacia la cocina donde encuentro a mi madre preparando el almuerzo. La abrazo por detrás y beso su mejilla. Ella me sonríe pero siento cierto tipo de preocupación de su parte. Así que me acomodo en el mesón de la cocina, antes de hablar con ella. -¿Qué sucede mamá? -Nada hijo, ¿Por qué piensas eso? -No mientas Michelle, te conozco, sé que estas preocupada por algo. -Bien pues si – me mira seriamente – estoy preocupado por mi hijo mayor. -¿Por mí? – me sorprende escucharla, a decir verdad no creo que haya sido más feliz en mi vida como lo soy últimamente. -Si… bueno creo que lo de tu novia se te está yendo de las manos. -¿Qué? No! ¿Por qué piensas eso? -Josh, estas descuidando tu trabajo, apenas tienes tiempo para descansar y viajas para estar con ella. No estas prestando la atención necesaria a tu vida, prácticamente vives por ella. Me preocupa que te enfermes, además… No sé qué responder, por un lado me siento furioso porque sé que ella piensa que lo de Alex es pasajero y no puede ver que en verdad estoy feliz - Además ¿qué? -Necesito saber si se están cuidando, Josh. No es momento para que tengas un hijo. No eres lo suficientemente maduro para ser padre, dañaría tu vida, tu carrera. Sé que siempre tomas tus precauciones, pero estas tan cegado que tengo miedo que quedes atrapado en algo que no quieres…. -Alto ahí – detengo su discurso, antes de que diga algo en contra de mi novia de lo que pueda arrepentirse – primeramente mamá aprecio tu preocupación pero es MI vida, lo siento, sé que soy grosero pero no me gusto lo que dijiste. Amo a esa chica y tener hijos con ella en verdad me hicieran de lo más dichoso. Pero sé que aún no es el momento. Solo para que sepas, nosotros aún no hemos estado juntos de esa manera. Mi madre suelta el aire que estaba conteniendo – Aunque no te niego que es algo que quisiera que pase, pero ella no está lista, así que por favor deja de pensar que ella solo está interesada en mi fama y en mi dinero o que quiere atraparme; te aseguro que no tiene ni un pelo de ambición e ella. Yo la amo, si mamá por primera vez estoy verdaderamente enamorado, estoy dispuesto a dejar todo si ella me acepta en su vida… -¿Y ella te ama? – me interrumpe, mi cabeza cae al piso. -No lo sé mamá, creo que me quiere y muchas veces pienso que me ama pero no estoy completamente seguro. De lo que si estoy 100% seguro es que hare lo posible para que me llegue a amar como yo. -Hijo, te aseguro que si ella te ama no dejará que dejes todo tu mundo por ella, el amor es sacrificio, sí, pero también es compartir, buscar lo mejor para el otro. -Solo sé que estoy dispuesto a hacer todo por ella – mi mamá me abraza - ¿a qué viene todo eso de tu interés por mi vida sexual? Me toma del mentón y levanta mi cuello – Bueno, creo que esto muestra que no simplemente se besan – sonrío divertido por sus suposiciones. -Además mira esto – se acerca al computador que esta prendido y empieza a mostrar videos y fotos de mi verano. Incluso el video de mi baile, de mi cantando y un video de cuando bailábamos en la fogata y nos besábamos. No sé cuándo mi vida se hizo así de pública, antes no me molestaba pero ahora ver esos encabezados en las notas me da un apretujón en el estómago, recordando que yo provoque esto. Lo más reciente, mis fotos en el aeropuerto con Alex. En ambas muestran de cerca nuestros chupetones y el encabezado \"Picantes imágenes de Josh y Alex\", \"estos chicos ya duerme juntos y por lo que se observa su relación paso de picante a salvaje\" y muchas cosas así. -Bueno me alegra de que me lo hayas dicho hijo, perdóname por meterme en tu vida, pero es difícil no preocuparse, soy tu madre y eso hago. No podía creer que exista una chica tan perfecta. Como la describen Connor, tú y tus abuelos pareciera que hablan de un ángel, no de alguien real. -Pues ella es un ángel, mi ángel. -Estoy ansiosa por conocerla – mi mamá me abraza de nuevo – confío en ti Josh, sé qué harás lo mejor, pero recuerda lo que te dije sobre el amor y el sacrificio. Y… ten cuidado, cuando alguien ofrece su corazón como tú lo estás haciendo, es más fácil que te hagan daño. Solo di un gracias por su preocupación. Amo a mi mamá y en verdad quiero que este de orgullosa de mi. Luego de instalarme por fin pude hablar con mi novia. Extrañaba verla, aunque sea por video conferencias, ella es como el aire para mí, es todo lo que quiero. Le pido perdón por causarle tantos problemas con la prensa, porque su vida ahora es pública y llena de mentiras. Ella me dice que no es mi culpa, que no se puede hacer nada con la prensa especuladora. Si tan solo supiera que todo es mi culpa, no sé cómo lo tomaría, no sé si soy lo suficientemente valiente para decirle y arriesgarme a perderla. No. No lo soy. Me sumerjo en mis nuevos proyectos, entro de nuevo en rutina donde trabajo, paso tiempo con mi familia y hablo con mi novia por videoconferencia. Cada vez nuestras conversaciones son mas calientes y tienen mucha picardía, lo que me provoca un dolor físico por no tenerla a mi lado y mas aun cuando tengo que sumergirme en duchas frías. - Hijo ¿crees que podamos usar tu computadora para hablar con tus abuelos?- mi papá me dice mientras terminamos de cenar. -Claro papá. -Entonces ve por ella ahora mismo -Yo voy – dice Connor corriendo hacia mi habitación. -¿Por qué la urgencia? -Hoy es su aniversario y tenemos que felicitarles – es cierto, lo había olvidado. Si me hubiera acordad hubiera pedido a mi novia que les prepare algo especial. Después de todo debo agradecerles por recibirme cada vez que viajo para estar con Alex. Nos amontonamos alrededor de mi laptop, esperando que mi abuelo conteste la videollamada. -Hola Familia – mi abuelo con contesta, y me doy cuenta que esta vestido muy elegante. -Hola Papá ¿no interrumpimos verdad? Solo queríamos felicitarlos por su aniversario. -Oh muchas gracias, esperen llamo a mi esposa – escuchamos como llama a mi abuela – estábamos por salir a festejar con… -Hola Familia – mi abuela lo interrumpe empujándolo de la vista de la cámara. -Hola Abuela, Feliz Aniversario – la felicito y toda mi familia hace lo mismo. -Muchas gracias, sobre todo gracias a ti Josh por la sorpresa - ¿sorpresa? ¿a qué se refiere? -Yo no… -Estábamos por salir a la reservación que preparaste, es un gran detalle. Tu novia en verdad nos dio una gran sorpresa cuando llego con un ramo de rosas y con las reservaciones – sonrío ante las ocurrencias de mi novia. Seguramente dijo que todo era mi idea para no recibir elogios. -Abuela ¿Alex está ahí? -Si aquí esta, escuchándote. Solo que no quiere verlos, ya sabes lo tímida que es. – dice mi abuela sonriendo más allá de la cámara, seguramente a mi novia. -Alex mi vida, asómate quiero presentarte a mi familia – grito a través de la cámara, lo que hace reir a mi familia. Veo como mi abuela tira de ella para poder verla. Se sienta frente al computador y sonríe. Puedo ver que está nerviosa. -Hola pequeña – la saludo – no seas tímida, mira este es mi papá Chris y mi mamá Michelle, a Connor ya lo conoces. -Hola – dice ella con una voz muy dulce – mucho gusto en conocerlos señor y señora Hutcherson, hola Connor. Mi mamá y papá también la saludan de una manera muy formal. Decido hacer bromas para que se aligeren las cosas y muy pronto todos estamos riendo. -Gracias Alex por lo de mis abuelos – le guiño el ojo para que me entienda que agradezco que se haya preocupado por hacerme quedar bien con mis abuelos y sobretodo porque se interesa por mi familia. -No tienes por qué agradecer – nos quedamos mirándonos a través de la cámara. Otra punzada de dolor me llega al darme cuenta que no la tengo cerca, quisiera abrazarla, besarla y muchas otras cosas que no sería correcto nombrar. -Bueno gracias por acordarse familia, peor es hora de que nos retiremos o perderemos nuestras reservaciones – mi abuelo nos quita de nuestra ensoñación. Nos despedimos todos deseándoles suerte. Cuando la imagen de mi novia desaparece me quedo viendo la pantalla. -No lo puedo creer, entonces es cierto – mi papá empieza a reír – Mi hijo está enamorado, hasta le brillan los ojos cuando la mira y suspiro por lo menos 10 veces mientras ella hablaba. -Y eso que no le has visto cuando esta con ella, parece un perrito faldero – dice Connor y le lanzo una mirada de cállate-o-te-calló. -No es gracioso, ya se los dije, estoy enamorado. -Una cosa es escucharte, pero otra cosa es verlo – dice mi papá dándome unas palmaditas en el hombro. -Bueno ya no lo molesten – interrumpe mi mamá – Me pareció una chica muy agradable en especial en el hecho de que se preocupe por tus abuelos y te haga quedar bien, no creas que no me di cuenta que no tuviste nada que ver con su sorpresa de aniversario, espero tener tiempo de conocerla mejor. No te averguences por lo que este par te diga. Cuando tu papá andaba detrás de mí era más cursi que muchas veces me provoca nauseas a mí mismo. Y Connor con su nueva novia es igual de empalagoso. Me río de ellos cuando fruncen el ceño sin poder defenderse de mi mamá. Ahora yo soy el que se burla de este par. Así siguen pasando los días. A veces me estreso por las obligaciones que tengo que cumplir. Pero solo el hecho de hablar con mi niña hace que mi mundo vuelva a ser perfecto. Estoy en Los Ángeles con Connor. Tuve que venir a arreglar unas cosas de trabajo y aprovecho para asistir a la fiesta de mi amigo Avan. Regreso a mi departamento para prepararme, cuando entro en la habitación de Connor lo encuentro en videoconferencia con mi novia. Mi novia. Ambos están riéndose y me saludan dándose una mirada de complicidad. -Hola pequeña – saludo a mi novia y ella me envía un beso volado - ¿De que hablaban? Ellos se miran y sonríen. Sé que esconden algo y me siento celoso de mi novia por ganarse la confianza de mi hermano más que yo, y de Connor por tener secretos con ella, que yo no conozco. Es estúpido lo sé, pero no puedo evitarlo. -Nada – dice ella. -Ok, no le digan nada al hermano y novio. -No es nada malo Josh, solo son cosas entre Connor y yo. -¿desde cuándo existen Connor y tú? -Oh por Dios, Josh. ¿No estas celoso, verdad? - pregunta Connor carcajeándose. -No puede ser hermano, en verdad estás loco – todo esto me hace enfadar. Pero después de pensarlo bien creo que tienen razón. -Olvídenlo, Connor ve a prepararte para la fiesta de Avan – Connor entra en su baño y yo me acomodó para conversar con mi novia. -Así quee….. ¿Cuál es el secreto? -No te puedo decirlo, por algo es un secreto. -Por favor, por favor, por favor… -Ok, odio tus pucheros, pero promete que no le dirás nada a Connor – cuando asiento, continua – Connor está confundido sobre su nueva novia. Él cree que ella quiere dar el siguiente paso, pero no está muy seguro. No sabe qué hacer, no quiere presionarla, quiere hacer lo correcto. -Mmmmm, interesante… y ¿Por qué no me pregunto a mí? -Porque eres hombre Josh, él necesita saber si las señales que ella le da en verdad son lo que él piensa. -¿Y tú que le dijiste? -Según lo que me conto Connor, ella quiere tener sexo con él. Además ya estuvieron a punto de hacerlo. Solo le aconseje que si en serio van a tener sexo, la haga sentir como la chica más especial, y que sean responsables. -No puedo creer que mi hermano tendrá sexo con su novia antes que yo. -¿Así que esto se trata de una competencia? – me pregunta molesta. -No, no, solo… solo… es que me sorprende que mi hermano ya haya crecido, solo es eso. No tiene nada que ver con nosotros no teniendo sexo, cuando estemos listos lo haremos. Aunque espero que sea pronto – lo último lo digo casi susurrando, pero cuando Alex frunce el ceño sé que me escucho -No Alex, no quise decir eso... mierda no se ni lo que digo… -Cállate Josh – ella me mira ceñuda – no empeores las cosas. -No te enojes por favor – hago un puchero esperando que ella me perdone, pero lo que en realidad logra es que se eche a reír. -Definitivamente no puedo con tus pucheros, son demasiado ridículos - El alivio me recorre rápidamente. -Es que soy adorable, no puedo evitarlo. -No, lo que eres es ridículo – ella se ríe aún más duro – bueno me tengo que ir, tengo turno esta noche. Diviértete en la fiesta de Avan. -Solo voy por no fallarle, pero dudo que me divierta sin ti. -Vamos Josh, no me hagas sentir culpable. Yo también salgo y me divierto. Claro que te extraño pero no puedo hacer nada más. Tú querrías que me divierta, yo espero lo mismo. -Si tú lo dices, pero es obvio que pensaré en ti todo el tiempo. -Tú también estas en mi mente en cada momento, Josh. Ahora más te vale divertirte. Me despides de Connor. Te quiero Josh. -Yo te amo – mis palabras quedan en el aire porque ella ya se desconectó. Llegue a la fiesta de Avan. Connor es muy amable y de pronto se perdió de mi vista con un grupo de chicos salude a todos pero no tenía ánimos de entablar conversación con nadie. Solo podía pensar en que si mi novia estuviera aquí se hubiera ganado a todos rápidamente, disfrutaría de las bebidas, de la música… -No lo puedo creer Hutcherson, tienes una cara de me-quiero-largar-de-aquí – Avan me abraza mientras se burla. -No lo tomes a mal Avan pero… no estoy muy a gusto. La fiesta está buena pero no me hayo aquí. -En verdad el amor te pego duro amigo. -Es lo que todos dicen, pero sabes, no me importan lo que crean, yo soy feliz. -Y yo estoy feliz por ello. ¿Cuándo tendré el placer de conocerla? Si es tan especial como para tenerte así quizás puede robártela, después de todo soy más guapo que tú – le lanzo una mirada mordaz que lo hace reír – Tranquilo Hermano, era broma, no me mates. -Pues no me pareció gracioso – un sentimiento de melancolía me atravesó – no te imaginas como quisiera que este conmigo en estos momentos, cada vez es más difícil no extrañarla. Hay veces que creo que me desmoronaré, en las que quiero hacer mis maletas e ir tras ella… -No lo dices en serio ¿verdad?, ¿quieres dejar toda tu vida por una chica? No pensé que estuvieras tan atrapado. -Pues lo estoy, créeme que si estuviera completamente seguro de que ella me ama, no esperaría más. Apenas termine las grabaciones de Sinsajo y me estuviera mudando. -¿Aun no sabes si te ama? -algunas veces pienso que sí, pero….Aún no se han dicho las palabras. -Mi experiencia sobre mujeres me dice que ella está esperando que tú seas el primero en decirlas. Lo que no entiendo es porque aún no lo has hecho si está claro que lo que sientes es fuerte. -No es tan fácil Avan ¿Y si es demasiado pronto? ¿y si no siente lo mismo? -Si tú te pudiste enamorar en tan corto tiempo ella también pudo. Solo tienes que confiar en que ella sea sincera, debes arriesgarte. Esas palabras son fuertes, si las dices no habrá vuelta atrás, pero si no te arriesgas puedes perderla. Supón ella siente lo mismo y esta tan insegura como tú. Ella puede cansarse si piensa que lo de ustedes no llegara a nada. -Eso es estúpido, yo la amo, quiero pasar mi vida entera con ella, que se la madre de mis hijos, la mujer con la que despierte todas las mañana… - ¿Y ella lo sabe? – Me interrumpe Avan – Ello no va a adivinar, debes decírselo. Prométeme que lo harás la próxima vez que estés con ella. Si no lo haces, se lo diré yo. -Ni siquiera la conoces… -No será difícil encontrarla. Existe algo llamado internet por si no sabías. Me rio por sus ocurrencia y le doy un abrazo de agradecimiento – Te lo prometo. -Más te vale, ahora…. -Hola Josh – una vocecita nos interrumpe. Obviamente la reconozco. Definitivamente no debí haber venido. -Hola Shannon – Saluda Avan, yo solo le doy un asentimiento con mi cabeza. -¿Puede hablar contigo Josh? -Ok, ya no soy solicitado aquí, nos vemos luego – le doy una mirada a Avan de súplica, pero el solo se va sin mirar atrás. -Josh, te he extrañado mucho – dice poniendo su dedo en mi pecho, quiero alejarla pero sé que haría un escándalo si lo intento – me alegra que hayas venido, tenemos mucho de qué hablar. -¿Ah si? No recuerdo que tenga algo que tratar contigo. -No te hagas el difícil mi amor, sabes que los dos tenemos gran química. -Tienes razón, yo tengo mucha química con mi novia y tú me imagino que con alguien. -¿Aun no te cansas de esa oportunista? – Mis manos se vuelven puños – ya veo que no, pero o te preocupes, no soy celosa, puedes seguir con ella hasta que te canses. Mientras tanto nosotros podemos disfrutar y ella no se enterará – sus manos se envolvieron alrededor de mi cuello, me apresuró a quitarlas de ese lugar. La sujeto de sus muñecas para que me mire. -Nunca, escúchame bien, NUNCA vuelvas a dirigirte a mi novia con palabras despectivas. Lo de nosotros siempre fue un error. No te quiero cerca de mí ni de ella. -Te vas a arrepentir Josh por humillarme de esta manera. Me rogaras que vuelta a ti. -Tú eres la única que se humilla a sí mismo – me fui dejándola ahí antes de que pierda la paciencia. Me despedí de todos, por suerte Connor decidió venirse conmigo. Rogaba porque los días pasaran rápidamente. Las grabaciones de Sinsajo me tenían atareado. Por suerte Steven logro conseguirme espacio para poder acudir a la boda de Andrés. Apenas estaría unos días y tendría que viajar directamente a Londres para la premiere de Catching Fire. Unos días no serían suficientes para estar con ella. Pero ya lo tenía decidido. Le diría que la amo, y se ella me amaba luego de terminar esta premier y la filmación armaría mis maletas y me iría a vivir lo más cerca de ella. Quisiera pedirle matrimonio, pero creo que eso será más adelante, dudo que lo acepte ahora. Invertiría mi dinero en negocios, si fuera con ella sería mucho mejor. Lo único que deseo es tenerla a mi lado. En estos momentos solo puedo dar gracias porque sobreviví a este tiempo y estoy cada vez más cerca de ella. Estoy contando los minutos para encontrarnos. Solo quisiera que este avión aterrice ya. Hola de nuevo... se q dije q tardaría en actualizar pero ando con ataques de escribir... en verdad estoy en clases y en lugar de entender me viene una nueva idea.

UNA ENRADADA CANCIÓN DE AMOR porque es una enredada historia y una canción es uan historia. bueno ahora no suena muy lógico pero en mi cabeza lo hizo :) AVANCE: -Hola – mi sonrisa era estúpida en mis labios pero no podía evitarlo – me alegra de que ya estés aquí. Yo también te he extrañado mucho. -Muy bien ahora vamos por un café. Luces cansada y tenemos mucho que ponernos al día. -Tú lo único que quieres es que este despierta para besuquearnos. -Besuquearte en estos momentos encabeza mi lista de prioridades nos leemos luego . - Milet 3[Chapter 36] Capítulo 36 Mis ojos se cierran mientras estoy sentada. Tres malas noches, dos por tunos y una por estudiar. Definitivamente voy a dejar de cubrir a mis amigos en sus turnos. En el baño mojo mi rostro con agua fría para tratar de despertar. Acomodo mis cosas en mi casillero y encuentro un mensaje de Santiago diciéndome que no podrá venir a retirarme pero que lo hará Darío. Las cosas entre nosotros dos no son exactamente lo mejor, pero lo llevamos bien. Salimos de vez en cuando hablamos de todo y de nada a la vez. Él no ha hecho ningún comentario sobre mi relación, por lo que se lo agradezco. Los únicos momentos incomodos son cuando él me mira tiernamente, cuando me acaricia por cualquier cosa. Muchas veces estuvo a punto de besarme, lo sé por la forma en que me veía. Pero aprecio que no lo haya hecho, porque no sé si hubiera sido capaz de detenerlo. Amo a Josh, pero eso no quita que aun sienta algún tipo de cariño por él y sé que le hago daño, me duele hacerlo, no sé cómo compensarlo. Después de marcar mi tarjeta de salida me dirijo a la cafetería del hospital para encontrarme con él. Apenas me ve sus ojos se iluminan y una punzada de culpa me azota. Me acerco lentamente a él para saludarlo siendo recompensada por un beso en mi mejilla de su parte. -Hola Hermosa. Te ves cansada. -Gracias por el cumplido, dudo que me vea bien con estas ojeras. -Pues las orejas en ti se ven maravillosas, solo por ello tal vez se pongan de moda. Lista para irnos. -Claro, vamos – el me guía hacia la salida – Me preguntaba si quieres ir por un café conmigo. La verdad no creo que tenga nada de malo, el café definitivamente me caerá de maravilla así que acepto. Él toma mi bolso y envuelve su brazo alrededor de mis hombros. Me siento un poco incomoda pero cansada como para rehusarme. -Sabes… -empieza a decirme – siento como que nada ha cambiado, que somos otra vez solo tú y yo… te extraño, quisiera poder estar contigo. Sé que eso no es posible pero tan solo necesito que sepas que no puedo dejar de quererte. Soy consciente de que eres feliz, y estoy satisfecho con ello. Lo único que me hace feliz es que tú lo seas. Solo quiero saber si aún sientes algo por mí, no importa si es algo pequeño, solo necesito saber si al menos tengo un espacio en tu corazón que sea solo mío. -Darío, yo no sé qué decirte. -No tiene nada que decirte Darío. Y te agradecería mucho si dejaras de abrazarla- esa voz hizo que mi corazón se acelerara. Giramos para ver a Josh mirándonos con el ceño fruncido. -Josh – con un grito corrí hacia él y me recibió con los brazos abiertos. -Hola pequeña, no te pregunto si me extrañaste porque ya veo que lo hiciste. -Debiste llamarme y decirme cuando llegabas. -Quería darte una sorpresa – dijo besando mis labios. -Pues sí que es una sorpresa – soltó Darío. -Tú no te metas, es la última vez que te veo tan cerca de MI novia. -Basta Josh – le di una mirada dura mientras me apartaba de él – Darío solo me llevaba a casa, no hizo nada malo así que compórtate con él. -Si Josh, no entiendo el porqué de tus celos. Deberías estar seguro de que ella te quiere. Deja de ser inseguro. -Darío – llamé su atención, lo conocía bien, quería hacer enojar a Josh. -Lo siento Alex, es fácil hacer enojar a tu novio. Creo que me voy, nuestro café queda pendiente – con un asentimiento se fue hacia su auto. Me gire para enfrentar a Josh que me miraba ceñudo. -¿Qué hacías con él? -¿Vamos a empezar con esto de nuevo? Porque si es así no estoy de humor – empecé a caminar sin rumbo. Sentí como Josh corrió hasta alcanzarme y me abrazo por mi espalda. -Perdóname por favor. Soy un experto en dañar momentos especiales. – beso mi cuello y con eso toda mi furia se evaporo. Me giro para enfrentarlo y luego de una demostración pública de afecto, hablo:- Hola hermosa, no sabes cuánto te extrañe. -Hola – mi sonrisa era estúpida en mis labios pero no podía evitarlo – me alegra de que ya estés aquí. Yo también te he extrañado mucho. -Muy bien ahora vamos por un café. Luces cansada y tenemos mucho que ponernos al día. -Tú lo único que quieres es que este despierta para besuquearnos. -Besuquearte en estos momentos encabeza mi lista de prioridades – tomó mi mano y me jalo al auto. Condujo hasta un local de comida rápida. -Espérame aquí, voy por la comida – le sujete la mano antes de que salga del auto, tirando de él hacia mí para juntar nuestro labios. Hubo algo en ese beso que me hizo amarlo más. Acaricio mi mejilla y juntó nuestras frentes. -¿Y eso fue por…? – porque te amo, quería gritarle. -¿Debo tener una excusa para besuquearte? -Pues no, puedes besuquearme cuando quieras – me dio un beso fugaz antes de dirigirse por el estacionamiento. Estuve a punto de decirle que lo amo. Pero mi inseguridad se interpuso otra vez. Me acomodé en mi asiento y decidí dormir un poco ya que suponía que Josh tardaría. Luego de pelear contra el incómodo asiento me cambien al de atrás. Apenas me recosté mis ojos se cerraron y fui consumida por el sueño. Mi cuerpo estaba tan relajado, como en mucho tiempo no estuvo. Hubo un sonido de golpeteos y un aroma varonil que me envolvía. Mi temperatura era adecuada y la posición de mi cuerpo era cómoda. Mis ojos luchaban por abrirse mientras volvía al mundo consciente. Sentí unos pequeños roces, delicados como una pluma en mi rostro que al mismo tiempo me provocaba cosquillas. Cuando unos labios se posaron en mi frente fue cuando mis ojos se abrieron. Lo primero que caí e cuenta es que llovía; lo segundo es que aún estaba en el asiento trasero del auto de Josh y una manta me cubría. Por ultimo note sus brazos envolviéndome como un bebé, mi oreja en su pecho donde el golpeteo de su corazón endulzaba a mi oído. Su mano jugaba con un mechón de mi cabello y mientras sonreía movía el mecho por mi rostro. Le sonreí de regreso y sus labios cayeron sobre los míos. -Perdón por despertarte, pero no pude resistirme. -Perdóname por dormirme. Tú viajas para estar conmigo y yo me quedo dormida en tu auto. -No te disculpes… verte dormir es tan hermoso como besarte – otra vez me sonríe – estabas cansada, ni siquiera sentiste cuando conduje hasta aquí y te acomode entre mis brazos. -Creo que cuando me abrazaste fue cuando más profundo dormí. Eres una estupenda almohada. -Quisiera que siempre pudiéramos estar así. Tú entre mis brazos donde nada ni nadie más que nosotros existan. -Fuera perfecto si pudiéramos hacer eso, lástima que no todos los sueños se cumplen, -Si me lo pidieras, dejaría todo y viniera aquí – su respuesta me toma por sorpresa. Fuera mi mayor deseo cumplido el que Josh esté todo tiempo a mi lado. Pero eso significa que él tenga que dejar todo lo que ama por mí. Lo amo pero no puedo permitirle que haga eso. Me quedo en silencio sin saber que decirle. Su sonrisa decae provocándome una punzada en mi pecho. – No es necesario que me respondas, no te aflijas por una respuesta – me sonríe, pero la sonrisa no llega a sus ojos. Lo único que puedo hacer es besarlo. Mi beso es urgente, es mi forma de distraerlo del dolor y trasmitirle mis sentimientos. Me coloco ahorcajadas de él y abandono sus labios para centrar mi atención en su cuello. Sus manos sujetan mis caderas. Sus dedos acarician mi piel y de sus labios escapan gemidos. Mordisquee su labio inferior y sentí su miembro luchan por salir de sus pantalones. Mi boca succiono el lóbulo de su oreja por lo que él nos cambió de posición recostándome sobre el asiento y cerniéndose sobre mí. Nuestras bocas jugaban con la del otro y ambos emitíamos gemidos bajos cuando nuestros cuerpos chocaban. Mis piernas se envolvieron en su cadera haciendo que nuestra temperatura aumente aún más sobre todo en esa estrecha zona de contacto. Tire de los bordes de su camiseta y él se la saco arrojándola hacia la parte delantera del auto. Logre hacer que giremos; ahora él estaba de espaldas sobre el asiento y yo nuevamente a horcajadas. Admire su torso desnudo. Él es hermoso. Mis dedos tocaban sus músculos bien formados que bajo mi toque se contraían y su suave piel que me invitaba a probarla. Deje un rastro de besos por sus clavículas y mordisquee su pezón provocándole un gruñido más fuerte. La excitación de ambos era inminente. Por primera vez decidí dejarme llevar. Las consecuencias vendrían luego; y deje de pensar cuando acarició mi abdomen por debajo de mi blusa y sus labios consumieron los míos. Un golpe en el vidrio nos sacó del trance que estábamos. Ambos miramos hacia el vidrio para encontrarnos con un oficial de policía. Ni siquiera nos dimos cuenta cuando había dejado de llover. Me retire de encima de Josh hacia un lado. Este agarro su camiseta que había caído sobre el volante poniéndosela. -Quédate aquí – dijo y bajo del auto cerrando la puerta tras él. Mis mejillas se pusieron caliente y no podía creer lo estúpidos que fuimos. ¿Qué dirían mis padres cuando me tengan que recoger en la comisaría? ¿Qué encabezados tendrán las revistas si se enteran de esto? Qué vergüenza. Me acomode mi ropa y me pase al asiento del copiloto. Cubrí mi rostro con mis manos y quería llorar por los malditos problemas que mis hormonas causaron. Cuando la puerta se abrió y Josh subió no me atreví a mirarlo y volví a cubrirme el rostro. -Alex ¿Qué pasa? – dijo tratando de quitar mis manos del rostro – Todo está bien, tranquila. -Josh, somos estúpidos ¿Qué dirán todo el mundo si vamos a la cárcel por tener sexo en vía pública? -Buenoooo, todo mundo piensa que ya hemos tenido sexo – me miro divertido – pero no te preocupes, gracias a mi encanto y a mi bolsillo no tendremos problemas. Ahora no quiero verte así mi niña. Nada de tristezas, mejor déjame besuquearte un poco más. -Estás loco – no pude evitar sonreír ante sus ocurrencias- y claro que no me besuquearas más, por lo menos no mientras sigamos aquí. Me guiño el ojo y condujo hacia su casa. Sus abuelos no estaban. Algo que no es poco común ya que por sus negocios estaban fuera mucho tiempo como mis padres. Vimos una película recostados en su cama. Y nuevamente quede dormida en sus brazos. Me despertó cuando llego la pizza que había pedido, luego de cenar se dispuso a llevarme a mi casa obviamente luego de una sesión muy placentera de besuqueos. Hola a tod s... seguimos con los capítulos cursisss..ok no, románticos .. tendremos un poco mas de estos..! les daré una pista de que pasará mas adelante.. mucho mas adelante x lo menos en unos 10 capítulos mas. escuchen: TE QUISE OLVIDAR - MDO. el próximo capítulo tendrá una revelación importante, esperenlo ansiosas :) antes de avanzar mas, su relación debe hacerse fuerte no creen?

No me pondría eso ni en un millón de años. -¿Por qué no? Te vieras espectacular con esto. -Tú solo buscas una manera de dejarme lo más desnuda posible. -Yo siempre te quiero desnuda, pero verte en un traje como este es todo lo que un chico quiere.- la sonrisa en mi cara debió ser tan grande que ella suspiro y negó con su cabeza. -Como te odio.[Chapter 37] Capítulo 37 Llegue a la casa de mi novia. Música sonaba por su ventana abierta. Decidí entrar a buscarla ya que tenía sus llaves que olvidó en mi auto. Sabía que estaba sola y decidí sorprenderla. Cuando subía las escaleras empezó a sonar una canción en una tonada muy dulce. Y fue más dulce cuando ella empezó a cantarla. Su voz y la melodía eran preciosas. Cuando entre su cuarto me di cuenta que estaba en el baño y decidí recostarme en su cama. (It´s Only Love – College 11: www_youtube_com/watch?v=od7hKl5Re1M ). Sin duda estaba enamorada. Uno no podría cantar con tanto sentimiento si no sintiera lo que dice. You are the life in me (Tú eres la vida en mí) My favorite melody (Mi melodía favorita) You are what makes me strong (Tu eres lo que me hace fuerte) An angel sent from above (Un ángel enviado desde arriba) Your love sets me free (Tu amor me hace libre) Forever the harmony (Siempre la armonía) This fits my song (Esto encaja con mi canción) Don't you know it's only love? (¿No sabes que es sólo amor?) Mi corazón golpeteaba por la esperanza de que ella me amara como yo lo hago. Ese cosquilleo en mi estómago que empecé a sentir desde que la conocí también se hizo presente. Ella cantaba muy hermoso, puede que sea mi novia pero debo admitir que su voz es única. Si ella quisiera pudiera dedicarse a cantar. Estoy seguro que le iría muy bien. Ella sale de pronto meneando sus caderas y girando, lo que atrae mi mirada directamente a su lindo trasero. Sus ojos están cerrados mientras canta la última parte de su canción y cuando cae en cuenta de mi presencia sus mejillas se tornan rojas. -Espero que estuvieras cantando pensando en mí. -Solo tú estás en mis pensamientos – se acercó a besarme, cuando se agacho sus rizos hicieron cortina alrededor de nuestros rostros – Ahora me puedes decir ¿Cómo diablos entraste? -Dejaste tus llaves olvidadiza – dije besando su nariz – ahora más vale que te apures porque Santiago nos está esperando. -Así que él también vendrá. ¿no podrías decirme a dónde vamos? Por lo menos para saber que tengo que llevar. -No, y lo único que debes llevar es tu hermosa presencia. Y nada de pucheros Alexandra. – le advierto cuando empieza a fruncir sus labios. Cuando hace eso solo quiero besarla. -Bien vamos. Pero no te besaré hasta que sepa a donde vamos – ahora soy yo el que hace pucheros – Jaaaa Golpe directo a tu ego Hutcherson. Salimos de su casa a recoger a Santiago. Él me ayudo a planear lo del lugar así que tenía que llevarlo. Viene con su nueva novia, Lisset, sé que a Alex no le agrada mucho, pero no lo demuestra. Yo tampoco estaba muy a favor de la chica, es decir, es educada pero me comía con la mirada y no quería que su novio se moleste conmigo. Creo que Santiago debería estar con alguien con carácter como Fernanda. Llegamos a la hostería. Era un lugar muy bello. Tenía un lago con botes, bosques para cabalgata y una gran piscina con agua termal. Como era jueves no habría gente lo que nos daría más privacidad. Nos bajamos del auto. Abrace a mi novia por detrás y caminamos hacia el lago. Nos detuvimos ahí. Puse mi mentón en su hombro y ella apoyo su cabeza en la mía. -¿Qué te parece? -Es hermoso. Siempre quise venir aquí, me lo recomendaron mucho pero siempre se presentaba algo. -Me alegra que estés aquí conmigo. -Cuando estoy contigo todo es una nueva y maravillosa experiencia – sus palabras hacen que mis piernas se vuelvan gelatina y como el hombre primitivo que soy la beso. Tomo sus piernas y la levanto, ella las envuelve en mi cintura. Nuestro beso es lento, dulce, pero de los mejores que nos hemos dado. -Ustedes dejen de besuquearse, vamos a cabalgar – Santy nos llama. La bajo con cuidado y tomo su mano. Le doy un beso fugaz y vamos a buscar nuestros caballos. Los cuatro dimos una pequeña cabalgata. Me divertí mucho mientras Alex y Santy contaban sus anécdotas médicas. Algunas no tenían idea de qué diablos decían pero su risa era contagiosa. Cuando Alex aceleraba el paso de su caballo venían imágenes a mi mente en los que yo la llevaba a ver el ocaso. Los dos en un caballo, ella aferrada a mí para protegerla. Fuera más fácil si en verdad pudiera protegerla. Cada vez que me pongo muy sobreprotector ella me pone en mi sitio. Un golpe directo a mi ego. Luego de la cabalgata fuimos a almorzar. Decidimos caminar un poco cada pareja por su lado. -¿Nunca has pensado en hacer de cupido entre Santiago y Fernanda? -Eso no es necesario, ellos ya fueron algo y créeme su relación fue intensa. -Lo sabía. Estaba seguro de que ahí hubo algo. -Bueno pues eres perceptivo porque el resto de personas no se da cuenta. -¿Por qué terminaron? -Muchas cosas. Estaban los exs de cada uno, además sus personalidades chocaban mucho. Ninguno de los dos cedía cuando se les metía algo en la cabeza. Muchas veces tuve que intervenir. -Yo creo que ellos son perfectos juntos. Habrá que hacer algo para que se reúnan. -Ni se te ocurra hacer de cupido, Josh. No quiero que Fernanda sufra. Aunque ella no lo admita ella sigue enamorada de él. Pero aunque Santy es mi amigo le hace daño. -Ok, pero insisto que deberíamos hacer algo – la tomo de mi mano – Vamos – y la dirijo a la piscina. Cuando Alex la vio me miro con ceño fruncido. -Me trajiste a un lugar donde puedo nadar ¿Cómo se supone que lo haga si no traje ropa adecuada? Mierda Josh, porque no me dijiste – sabia de su fascinación por nadar pero tengo preparado otra estrategia para que mi morbo de hombre y mi viejo amigo disfrute un poco. -Si te lo decía arruinaría la sorpresa – le digo abrazándola – vamos a comprarte un traje adecuado. -Sabes que aquí venderán de esos trajes de poca tela, no mi blusa y mi short. -Habrá algo que puedas usar, a menos que no quieras nadar en esta caliente piscina. -Algo me dice que tu planeaste esto – me mira aun con su ceño fruncido. Me acerco y lo beso. -Vamos a conseguirte un traje de baño, princesa – la lleve a la tienda de regalos donde vendían también trajes de baños. Gracias al cielo tenían solo trajes de 2 piezas. Agradezco a la vida por mi suerte. Cada uno era más sexy que otro. Encontré un traje rojo que apenas eran 2 triángulos pequeños en el busto y un hilo en la parte inferior. Mi mente morbosa viajo rápidamente a imágenes de ella usando esto. -No tientes tu suerte Hutcherson. No me pondría eso ni en un millón de años. -¿Por qué no? Te vieras espectacular con esto. -Tú solo buscas una manera de dejarme lo más desnuda posible. -Yo siempre te quiero desnuda, pero verte en un traje como este es todo lo que un chico quiere.- la sonrisa en mi cara debió ser tan grande que ella suspiro y negó con su cabeza. -Como te odio – capte la sonrisa del chico que atendía la tienda. No quitaba los ojos de Alex mientras ella excavaba entre los modelos de trajes de baño. Los celos empezaron a burbujear al pensar en él imaginándose a mi novia con poca ropa. Le di una mirada de furia y por suerte el chico era inteligente y se puso a guardar los trajes que descartamos. Seguí fantaseando un poco más con los trajes hasta que Alex se decidió por un traje violeta con lunares de varios colores. Era muy sexy también, para nada vulgar. No podía esperar verla usando solo eso. Le acompañe a los vestidores. Me puse mi traje y salí para encontrarme con Santy y Lisset nadando en la piscina. Me zambullí en la piscina y con Santiago empezamos a hacer competencias de nado. Cuando Alex salió, estaba cubierta con su toalla, era un poco frustrante pero sabía que tendría que quitarse esa toalla para entrar. -Alex, ya entra en la piscina, no seas gallina – le grito Santiago. -No te burles, esto de andar mostrando mucha piel no es mi estilo – cuando dejó caer su toalla definitivamente mi corazón se detuvo y mi viejo amigo despertó de un brinco. Gracias a los cielos porque estaba dentro del agua. Su figura podría hacer babear a cualquiera. Por primera vez pude ver su abdomen. Era delgado, era plano pero no se veía forzado como el de una modelo, todo lo contrario, era natural con un pequeño gordito que la hacía humana y no superficial. Sus largas piernas llamaron toda mi atención. Definitivamente ese traje de baño era el suyo. Esta noche tendría que darme una ducha muy fría y encargarme de mi viejo amigo. Ella salto a la piscina de un brinco en la parte más honda y nade rápidamente a ella cuando recordé que no sabe nadar. Aunque sé que su técnica de flotar nunca le ha fallado no puedo evitar ser sobreprotector. La alcancé cuando se sujetó del borde de la piscina. La encarcele con mis brazos mientras giraba para enfrentarme. -Tú si sabes cómo dejar sin palabras a un chico, pequeña. Definitivamente eres la mujer más sexy que he conocido. En estos momentos envidio a esos benditos pedazos de tela que te envuelven. -Pues estos únicos pedazos de tela que uso se quedaran en donde están, Hutcherson. Si tientas tu suerte saldrás muy mal parado. -Tal vez quiera tentar mi suerte, Alex. -Te Odio – me dice lanzándome agua para apartarme. -No puedes odiarme- le digo haciendo un puchero. La hago girar, para que queda a espaldas de mí. -¿Porque no puedo odiarte?- me pregunta y yo me aferro a ella con mis brazos. Es ahora o nunca. Me acerco a su oído y le susurro mi mayor secreto. -Por qué te Amo, Alex... Hola a Todos... actualice pronto :) agradezcan q no keria estudiar y use de excusa esto..! xfn las palabras tan esperadas no creen? ahora deberán esperar x la respuesta de Alex..! Aprovecho la oportunidad para contarles algo. -Tenía 2 mejore amigas, eran mellizas. ambas se llaman Alexandra. comparten el mismo primer nombre. como les dije una de ellas falleció. pero aun tengo a una de mis mejores amigas q se llama Alex. ella y yo extrañamos mucho a su hermana. para no dejarles con mucho incógnita esta son sus iniciales: Alex 1 - JA y Alex 2 -PA -le dije a JA que escribiría un fic sobre Josh algun momento. le envié el link de la novela diciéndole que encontré el fic y q lo leera xq la protagonista llevaba su nombre. Hoy cayo en cuenta que se trataba de mi fic y se emociono. aunque dice q es injusto porque ella ama mas a Josh que su hermana (PA q es kien falleció). Así que quedamos en q también podría tratarse de su historia. me pidio q suba un nuevo capítulo asi que se lo deben a ella. Perdonenme si tiene faltas de ortografía xq subo sin revisar. gracias x sus reviews. les pido q porfavor se tomen un minuto SOLO UN MINUTO en dejarlo... eso m impulsa a seguir actualizando xq se que lo están leyendo.. solo ese favor les pido :) AVANCE: -Este es mi lugar favorito del mundo….-suspira- no sé qué voy a hacer sin ti, no quiero regresar, ¡Alex pídemelo! ¿Qué? Otra vez con lo mismo. Giro y veo que no hay nadie cerca, Santy y Liss debieron ir a cambiarse. -Josh por favor no me pidas eso. -¿Por qué? ¿No me quieres a tu lado? - Milet 3[Chapter 38] Capítulo 38 -Te Odio – digo lanzándole agua. -No puedes odiarme- dice haciendo un puchero y me hace girar, quedando a espaldas de él. -¿Porque no puedo odiarte?- él me abraza fuertemente, y se acerca a mi oído para susurrarme. -Por qué te Amo, Alex – mi cuerpo se pone rígido ante sus palabras, es la primera vez que Josh me dice que me ama, siempre me dice que me quiere, que me extraña, que soy importante para él pero es la primera vez que dice estas palabras, mi cuerpo se pone tenso y sé que lo siente y afloja su agarre, yo giro y lo veo directo a los ojos. No puedo descifrar lo que piensa. ¿Esta triste? ¿Desilusionado? ¿Espera que yo diga que lo amo también? ¿Lo hago? Claro que lo hago, después de lo ocurrido con Darío, sé que mi corazón quedo devastado, pero Josh se ha colado bajo mi piel, si él me deja no sé qué haría, caería de nuevo en esa depresión, mi corazón quedaría hecho pedacitos y esta vez no habrá quien lo vuelva a armar, es eso lo que siento por Josh. Lo amo. Me doy cuenta que he creado una necesidad por él, él se ha convertido en mi razón para seguir, el dueño de mi alegría, de mi tristeza, de mi vida, es más vital que el propio aire ¿Lo amo? SI.. Definitivamente lo hago. -Alex sé que es muy pronto para decirlo, bueno quizás pienses eso pero yo estoy seguro….-me mira fijamente con una dulce mirada- no quiero tu respuesta, en verdad, no quiero abrumarte, pero ya no resistía más, necesitaba decírtelo, tengo la necesidad de decírtelo desde que empezamos nuestra relación, no sé cómo, no sé cuándo, ni por que fue tan rápido. Pero desde que te conocí en Denver no he podido sacarte de mi mente, y ahora mucho menos de mi corazón, me di cuenta que lo que sentía por ti era el sentimiento más puro y fuerte que experimentado en mi vida – pasa su mano por su cabello, mostrando frustración- Alex perdóname en serio, no sé qué haría sin ti, olvídalo, no te abrumaré más, todo a su tiempo, olvida mis palabras, no quería arruinar el momento… Lo corto rápidamente con un beso, siento que él se sorprende al inicio y luego se deja llevar profundizándolo, es un beso dulce, pero en verdad las palabras se quedaron atrapadas en mi garganta, era la única forma que cerrará su sexy boca y no arruinara el momento con sus disculpas, yo lo amo también, esa es mi verdad, muchas veces quise decírselo pero me alegro de que él lo haya hecho antes. Se separa de mí con una gran sonrisa, y me sujeta por los hombros sin borrar el contacto visual. -Entonces, no estás enojada conmigo?- niego con la cabeza. -Es un alivio mi princesa- quiero decirle lo que siento pero las palabras siguen atoradas en mi garganta- en verdad no quería perderte por esa tontería de mi parte. -No es un tontería –espeto rápidamente, y le doy un tierno beso en el comisura de sus labios. -Te amo princesa –suelta un suspiro- la gran pregunta es…-vacila un momento- Tú.. Me.. Amas, real o no real? Dios, una sonrisa atraviesa mis labios, sabe cómo llegar a mí, a través de frases que me encanta, no ha olvidado ese juego que mantenemos sobre libros y frases, él es mi Peeta… ok no, él es mi Josh, MÍO, este hombre maravilloso que dice amarme. -Real, Josh….- suelto un suspiro- Real. Veo como sus ojos se iluminan, y me miran tan dulcemente, siento como mi cuerpo se relaja al haber confesado este sentimiento, en verdad me encuentro en las nubes, en un cuento de hadas, del que no quiero salir. Estoy enamorada, perdidamente y jodidamente enamorada de este hombre… mi corazón está en sus manos, él puede hacer lo que quiera conmigo. Junta nuevamente nuestros labios, de una manera tierna, como si yo fuera de cristal y temiera romperme. Su contacto hace que me estremezca, que mi cuerpo quiera más de él, no quiero separarme, no quiero que me deje, no quiero que se vaya… -Hey, consíganse un cuarto, dejen de comer pan frente al pobre- dice Santy gritando muy divertido. Nos separamos rápidamente y giro hacia él y su novia – Que andes necesitado porque Liss no te da lo que urgentemente veo que necesitas no es razón para que dañes nuestro momento – digo guiñándole un ojo. -Juegas sucio Alexandra….- dice muy seriamente y se hecha a reír. Me giro a Josh llevando mis brazos a su cuello, y muy seductoramente le digo – En que estábamos? Él me mira tímidamente, lo que lo hace lucir dulce y mi corazón se estremece, tengo tanta suerte, no sé qué maravilla hice para merecerme este hombre- En que la mujer más bella del mundo me dijo que me amaba. Me sonrojo, no se la razón, pero me siento tímida con él, después de tanto tiempo mi corazón en verdad se abrió, él logro armarlo, dejarlo como si nada hubiera pasado, derribar todas mis defensas y adueñarse de él. -Te amo Josh, este amo con todo mi ser, eres…- me mira fijamente- eres mi vida ¿sí? No soy buena con las palabras, no sé cómo expresarme correctamente y explicarte la profundidad de lo que digo, pero es lo mejor que puedo hacer, decirte que te amo. -Y amo que me lo digas, yo sé que no es fácil, a mí también se me hizo difícil decirte por el miedo al rechazo, pero me siento la persona más dichosa de este universo por escucharlo de tus hermosos labios – pasa su pulgar por mi labio inferior- ¿Qué hiciste conmigo Alex? ¿Cómo pudiste cambiarme tanto? ¿Hacerme creer en verdad en el amor? ¿Hacerme amarte de esta manera? - ¿Sabes que podría preguntarte lo mismo?- le digo frunciendo el ceño. -Esas palabras hicieron que mi corazón salte, señorita. -Me complace escucharlo señor Hutcherson- me guiña un ojo y me atrae hacia él, sosteniéndome como si no quisiera dejarme ir, como si quisiera q estuviéramos juntos, mejor dicho fusionados por siempre, a lo que yo considero una magnífica idea, él hunde su rostro en mi cabello. -Este es mi lugar favorito del mundo….-suspira- no sé qué voy a hacer sin ti, no quiero regresar, ¡Alex pídemelo! ¿Qué? Otra vez con lo mismo. Giro y veo que no hay nadie cerca, Santy y Liss debieron ir a cambiarse. -Josh por favor no me pidas eso. -¿Por qué? ¿No me quieres a tu lado? -Claro que te quiero a mi lado, pero no puedo hacer eso, tú amas tu trabajo, amas actuar, amas a tu familia que viven en EEUU. -Pero te amo más a ti…..- me separa de él, paso su mano por su cabello, me doy cuenta que lo hace cuando se siente frustrado o confundido- Alex quizás suene obsesivo, pero te necesito cerca, lo dejaría todo por ti, solo tienes que pedírmelo y lo dejo todo…. Tengo dinero, puedo mudarme aquí e invertir en un negocio, mi familia puede venir conmigo si lo desean, o pueden venir de visitas cuantas veces quieran, yo…. – su voz se quiebra – solo quiero estar contigo ¿si? -Josh, yo te amo, y nunca, escúchame bien, nunca pediría que sacrifiques algo por mí – además, no quiero bajarme de esta nube, pero si las cosas no funcionan el habrá dejado todo por algo que no funcionó, no quiero ser pesimista y no quiero terminar este sueño, pero es la realidad. -En verdad no sé cómo responder a eso –me dice abrazándome nuevamente. -Josh, no llevamos ni 6 meses juntos, somos jóvenes, tenemos toda una vida para estar juntos, ahora solo tenemos que seguir así – tomo su mentón y levanto su rostro- si superamos esta prueba que implica la distancia nada nos separará. Suspira y niega con la cabeza –Alex, ¿no sé qué voy a hacer contigo? Derribaste todas mis buenas excusas y argumento para convencerte, pero has hecho que mire todo de una diferente manera, está bien, seguiremos así, pero quiero que te quede claro que por estar a tu lado, todo lo que haga será insuficiente, todo lo que abandone lo dejaré feliz porque lo hago por la persona más maravillosa de este mundo, no sería un sacrificio. -No quiero que hagas nada, tú haces mucho solo ofreciendo dejarlo todo, quizás yo también deba hacer sacrificios… Josh no cambiaría ni un pelo de ti… te quiero así y como eres, actuando o no, con dinero o sin él, con fama o sin ella… si te retuviera conmigo ahora no me sentiría completamente feliz. Su mirada refleja desilusión. -Porque te amo - suspiro – porque quiero que en verdad seas feliz, completamente, que seas tú mismo en todo sentido y si abandonas tu trabajo y a tu familia quiere decir que estas cambiando y por mí- le doy un tierno y fugaz beso- todo a su tiempo mi amor. Sonríe dulcemente, acaricio su mejilla con mis dedos - Mi amor, eso suena tan bonito – suspira y atrapa mi mano sosteniéndola contra su mejilla- tu ganas princesa, todo a su tiempo, pero…. -¿Pero..?- cierra sus ojos y suspira -Quédate conmigo - suelta dulcemente, en verdad amo ese juego de frases. -Siempre, Josh, siempre… Salimos de la piscina dispuestos a cambiarnos, fuimos hacia los vestidores. Yo entre en uno y Josh en otro. Él se quejaba por que no podíamos quedarnos más tiempo. Luego de minutos de luchar contra los nudos de mi traje de baño decidí pedir ayuda. -Josh, ¿estas vestido? -No aun, recién me acabo de secar ¿Por qué? ¿Quieres verme desnudo? – aunque no le vea puedo saber que tiene una sonrisota picara en su rostro. -Estúpido, quería que me ayudes con estos nudos de mi brasier. -Listo, espérame me pongo de nuevo mi traje de baño – escucho como abre la puerta de su vestidor – déjame entrar. Lo dejo pasar y cierra la puerta tras de él, me giro quedando de espaldas hacia él. Josh desata primero el nudo superior, siento que sus dedos tiemblan, aunque no entiendo la razón, desata el segundo nudo yo coloco los brazos sobre mi pecho evitando que mi brasier caiga – Gracias. Siento como el recorre mi espalda desnuda con la yema de sus dedos, dejando fuego sobre mi piel a su paso. Besa mi hombro y hace un camino con su boca por mi cuello hasta llegar a mi oreja derecha, donde le brinda un mordisco exquisito a mi lóbulo. Siento como un nudo se hace en mi vientre. Debo admitirlo yo también quiero más de él. Lo quiero lo más cerca humanamente posible que se pueda. Me dejo llevar por mis instintos, giro para encontrarme con sus ojos sobre mí, esa mirada llena de pasión, que seguramente yo también tengo. Alcanzo sus labios en un beso intenso, no me importa si me ve desnuda levanto mis brazos hacia su cuello y la parte superior de mi traje cae al suelo. Siento el calor de nuestros cuerpos juntos, piel sobre piel, mi torso desnudo contra el suyo, es una sensación exquisita. Él desliza sus manos por mis costados sin romper nuestro beso. Sujeta mis caderas y me levanta depositándome sobre la encimera del vestidor. Envuelvo mis piernas en sus caderas, estamos más cerca que nunca, pero siento que no es suficiente, necesito más de él. De este hombre tan maravilloso que ha llegado a mi vida. -Te amo Josh – le digo contra sus labios, él corta el beso, nuestras frentes chocan, el sujeta mi rostro con ambas mano y me mira sonriente. -Y yo te amo con toda mi alma, mi vida y mi corazón, de la forma más pura e inmensa que alguien puede amar a otra persona, eso nunca cambiará Alex, yo soy tuyo, y quiero que seas mía. -Lo soy Josh, soy tuya, quiero ser tuya – Josh sabe de lo que hablo, quiero estar con él de la forma más íntima que se puede, aunque me he negado todo es tiempo a esto, lo quiero. -Yo también quiero hacerte mía, y ser tuyo, pero este no es lugar- dice mirando alrededor – quiero que cuando estemos juntos sea porque los 2 estemos decididos, no porque yo haya provocado a tu cuerpo esta reacción, quiero que sea especial para ti, como lo será para mí. -Bueno, es obvio que no será tu primera vez – pone su dedo en mis labios. -Claro que será la primera vez – suspira – será la primera vez que este con la mujer que amo, la primera vez que haga el amor, será realmente especial para mí. Sus palabras hacen un nudo en mi corazón, me quiere, en verdad me quiere, y me respeta. Quiere todo de mí, no solo mi cuerpo. Lo beso, no quiero perderlo nunca. -Creo que deberías vestirte, aun no te he visto desnuda pero si lo hago no vamos a salir de aquí – cierra sus ojos y se suelta de mi agarre, se agacha y alcanza mi brazier, me lo da a ciegas - Vístete mi vida – sale de mi vestidor. Salgo ya cambiada y lo veo ahí esperándome, no puedo evitar sonrojarme. Me mira con una dulce sonrisa y yo también le sonrío y paso por su lado. Cuando su brazo me jala. -No me digas que estas avergonzada – yo mantengo mi mirada al suelo – Vamos preciosa, nunca te avergüences de lo que ocurra entre nosotros, eres lo más lindo que tengo – me toma de la barbilla y junta nuestras frentes – eres el ser más perfecto que existe. -¿Ah sí? – lo miro a sus preciosos ojos. -Eres- me besa – mi tesoro –beso – lo más grande que tengo – beso – te quiero – beso- con toda mi alma –beso – mi vida – beso – y mi corazón, eso nunca lo dudes. -Y tú eres todo para mí Josh – lo abrazo como si no quisiera soltarme, y precisamente es lo que quiero – Nunca me dejes por favor. -Nunca lo haría, sería como perder la vida, incluso si muero quisiera hacerlo entre tus brazos – nos fundimos en otro beso. Cada vez la necesidad de sus labios sobre mí crece. Abrazados fuimos a encontrarnos con Santy y su novia. Volvimos a la ciudad. Mañana será la boda de mi hermano y no nos veremos hasta el evento. Esta vez yo fui la que conduje. Es algo que me encanta hacer. Todo el tiempo nuestras miradas se cruzaban, todo era dulce, tierno, todo es diferente. Ahora sé que lo amo más. Luego de despedirnos con un gran beso, me acomode en mi cama a pensar. Todo mi día ha sido maravilloso. En realidad con Josh siempre es así. Con esas simples palabras todo cambia, se hace más fuerte una relación y un sentimiento. Mis ojos empiezan a cerrarse cuando mi celular vibro con un nuevo mensaje de Josh. -\"¿qué es un punto verde en una esquina?\" -\"¿Qué? O.O \" -\"Una arveja castigada jajajaja… admítelo.. te reíste :P \" -\"Claro que no, fue pésimo\" – la verdad es que si reí, pero debido a sus ocurrencias algo que nunca admitiría. -\"Aburrida… linda noche mi amor\" -\"Linda Noche 3\" Me estaba quedando dormida y me reí otra vez pensando en la bendita arveja cuando mi celular otra vez vibro. -\"Yo sé que te reíste\" – y sí, ahora si lo hice. Me carcajee leyendo su mensaje. Este chico era un ocurrido. Dormí con una gran sonrisa en mi rostro, esperando que nada me la pueda quitar. Hola a todos..! Bueno q les precio? espero mucho sus reviews. Ya era hora q esos admitieran que se amaban, ahora su relación esta consolidada. espero q hayan escuchado la canción q les deje el anterior capítulo. Hoy xfin llegue al capítulo q le daría la vuelta a todo. Es la base de la historia, pero no quise avanzar muy rápido a ese punto. asi q esperen ansios s el capítulo... tan tan tan... 41 Quisiera q cuenten lo q imagina q pasará. Con que creen q se enfrentaran mas adelante. -Gracias sus reviews. espero q los dejen. les toma menos de 1 min..! AVANCE: - Oh por Dios, estas hermosa – le digo ofreciéndole mi mano para bajar los últimos escalones – Tu novio es afortunado. -SI es muy afortunado de tenerme – la acerco a mí y deposito un beso en su exquisito cuello – no deberías hacer eso. Él es muy celoso, no quiero darle motivos de que desconfíe. Además lo amo con todo mi corazón nunca haría algo que sea malo para él. -Pues él te ama también, y daría todo por ti – envuelvo mis manos en su cintura atrayéndola para que nuestros rostros queden juntos. -¿Cómo lo sabes? – sus labios se ven provocativos con ese brillo labial. No puedo apartar mi mirada de ellos. Saber que son míos y puedo poseerlos. -¿Quien no lo haría? ¿Quién no amaría a la más hermosa persona del mundo? Si él no te amara fuera el mayor de los estúpidos. Por suerte para él te conoció y te amó en un instante[Chapter 39] Capítulo 39 Desperté feliz luego de soñar con ella. Ahora ya no es solo un sueño, es una realidad. Ella me ama como yo a ella. Es difícil imaginarse que alguna vez me sentiría de esta manera. Es verdad que el amor te cambia la perspectiva de la vida. Antes solía burlarme de las personas que actuaban raro. Ahora lo comprendo todo. Me despido de mis abuelos quienes me desean suerte, subo al auto y manejo por la ciudad por un rato hasta que por fin puedo ir a su casa sin parecer demasiado ansioso. Quiero verla, estoy ansioso y todavía falta media hora antes de ir por ella a la boda. Espero que le guste lo que he preparado. Reviso mi aspecto por millonésima vez, al saber que no puedo hacer nada más para verme mejor me rindo. Me acerco a la puerta para tocar al timbre cuando esta se abre y salen la mamá, el papá y el hermano de Alex.- Hola Josh – me saludan todos. -Josh en el mueble deje tu chaleco y corbata, nosotros ya nos vamos para la iglesia. Alex está terminando de arreglarse, llévala contigo y por favor no tarden – me dice mi suegra. Asiento y ellos rápidamente parten en el auto. Entro en la casa y encuentro el complemento de mi atuendo sobre el mueble de la sala. Me coloco el chaleco y me acomodo la corbata. Son de color dorado, muy elegante en combinación con mi camisa blanca y mi pantalón negro. -Alex, será mejor que bajes – le grito, y la verdad no me interesa si lleguemos tarde. Quiero verla. -Estoy bajando – y ahí es cuando se corta mi respiración. Cuando aparece en mi campo visual luciendo más bella que nunca. Su figura esbelta y su piel morena resaltan con su vestido dorado. En la parte superior el corte es recto con un pequeño encaje brillante en el filo. Se ajusta a su busto de una manera muy seductora. Mis manos pican al saber que puedo tocarlos pero aparto esos pensamientos morbosos rápidamente. Por debajo de su busto inicia la falda de una tela muy delicada que cae sutilmente. No es ajustado, es holgado pero se pega a su figura suavemente llegando a la mitad de su muslo donde sus largas y hermosas piernas lucen largas y contorneadas finalizando con sus tacos de aguja negros. Su cabello recogido en un moño alto dejando a la vista su exquisito y provocador cuello donde un collar con una perla única cuelga. Varios rizos caen alrededor de su peinado enmarcando su rostro. Su maquillaje es muy sutil. Sus ojos enmarcados de color beige y negro y sus pestañas más largas de las que nunca he visto. Sus labios de un rojo no muy fuerte aparentan haber crecido aún más. Mi boca literalmente cayó. Mi baba debe estar a punto de caer cuando ella continúa bajando las escaleras. - ¿Y bien? ¿Cómo estoy? - Oh por Dios, estas hermosa – le digo ofreciéndole mi mano para bajar los últimos escalones – Tu novio es afortunado. -SI es muy afortunado de tenerme – la acerco a mí y deposito un beso en su exquisito cuello – no deberías hacer eso. Él es muy celoso, no quiero darle motivos de que desconfíe. Además lo amo con todo mi corazón nunca haría algo que sea malo para él. -Pues él te ama también, y daría todo por ti – envuelvo mis manos en su cintura atrayéndola para que nuestros rostros queden juntos. -¿Cómo lo sabes? – sus labios se ven provocativos con ese brillo labial. No puedo apartar mi mirada de ellos. Saber que son míos y puedo poseerlos. -¿Quien no lo haría? ¿Quién no amaría a la más hermosa persona del mundo? Si él no te amara fuera el mayor de los estúpidos. Por suerte para él te conoció y te amó en un instante – ahora si tuve que besarla. Y fue de esos besos que sabes que conducirán a algo más. Mis manos viajaron al dobladillo de su vestido y mis dedos quemaron cuando entraron en contacto con la piel de sus muslos. Sus uñas se clavaron en la parte posterior de mi cuello. Nuestras lenguas se enredaban, danzaban. La pasión entre nosotros cada vez se desataba con más facilidad. Mis dedos llegaron a su ropa interior, sentí el encaje y lo recorrí con mis dedos la cinturilla ganándome un gemido que se escapó por sus labios. Eso me hizo recobrar la conciencia. No podemos hacer esto este día. Debe ser especial no un arranque de pasión. Además tenemos que irnos hacia la iglesia. Seguí besándola pero acomode su vestido. No quería mirar sus muslos y ropa interior porque esa sería mi perdición. Rompí nuestro beso, mas por su seguridad porque con ella dudo de mi control. Sus labios estaban hinchados por el beso y esa mirada de deseo provoca que mi cuerpo quiera tomarla sin consideraciones. -Creo que deberíamos irnos – le digo aun jadeando. -Tienes razón – se gira hacia el espejo buscando algo en su bolso. La tomo de mi mano atrayéndola hacia mí. -¿Qué crees que estás haciendo? – la tomo de nuevo por la cintura. -Busco mi brillo labial, por si no te diste cuenta está por toda tu cara y ya no en mis labios. -No lo harás hasta que lleguemos a la iglesia. A menos que quieras ponértelo a cada momento – mis dedos acarician su labio inferior – Necesito otra sesión de besuqueos antes de tener que pasar un montón de horas contigo comportándome frente a tu familia. -Estoy seriamente pensando en ponerte a dieta de besos – me sonríe pícara. -No juegues con eso Alexandra. Eso no nos conviene a ninguno de los dos – le muerdo el labio inferior. Lo tironeo un poco y cuando ella quiere que profundicemos el beso. Me alejo y tiro de ella fuera de la casa porque si no salíamos ahora, nunca lo haremos. Partimos hacia la iglesia, era una pequeña capilla y estaba llena de amigos, familiares. Steven me había sugerido que contrate seguridad, no le dije nada a Alex pero hable con Andrés. El comprendió la situación, pensé que se enfadaría pero no, me permitió hacerlo, tanto ara la iglesia como para el local donde será la fiesta. No quería que fotógrafos y periodistas irrumpan este evento tan importante en la familia de novia. Nos preparamos para ingresar a la iglesia. Todas las damas, incluida mi novia, se ubicaron en una sola columna junto con sus parejas. Algunos rostros eran conocidos como Fernanda con Santiago que estaban a 2 lugares de donde nosotros, también estaba Karen quien me comía con la mirada. La mamá de Diana entrego a las 8 chicas un pequeño ramo de rosas cremas unidas a una liga para colocarse en la muñeca. La tome y se la puse a mi novia. Deposite un beso en el dorso de su mano y su cara se tornó roja cuando noto que todos nos miraban. Mire por su hombro como un fotógrafo era llevado por 2 tipos enternados que supongo son los agentes de seguridad encubiertos. Me alegra que mi novia no se haya dado cuenta. La música sonó y la corte de honor empezó a avanzar. Le ofrecí a mi novia mi brazo en forma de gancho haciendo una reverencia y ella con una tratando de reprimir una sonrisa engancho su brazo en el mío. Avanzamos por el pasillo de la iglesia que estaba adornado de flores. Aunque era una pequeña capilla era realmente hermosa, sin duda una magnifica elección. Nos ubicamos 4 parejas en los asientos a cada lado del pasillo. Luego ingreso Andrés de la mano de su mamá y el papá de Andrés de la mano de la mamá de Diana. Él se veía nervioso pero feliz. Se ubicó en el altar. Las notas de la marcha nupcial sonaron y Diana apareció en la entrada junto con su padre. Su mirada fija en la de Andrés y la de él también en ella. Todo el mundo desapareció a su alrededor mientras se juntaban en el altar, el amor entre ellos era evidente. Una punzada de envidia me ataco al darme cuenta que no habrá nada que los separe, serán ellos dos por siempre; como yo deseo que se con Alex. La miro. Su mirada esta fija en su hermano y su cuñada. Tiene una sonrisa en su rostro, está feliz por su hermano. Me prometo a mí mismo hacerla feliz. Cuando nos casemos le daré la boda de sus sueños, le daré el mundo entero si es que lo quiere, todo por verla feliz. Y ese día cuando ella diga \"SI\" será el más feliz de mi vida porque sabré que se me ha entregado el universo, porque eso es ella mi universo. La ceremonia fue muy bonita, el sacerdote hizo muchas bromas sobre su futura vida e hijos que todos reímos. Toda la ceremonia mi mano estuvo enlazada con la de mi novia, nuestras miradas de complicidad se hicieron presentes. Cuando se dieron el beso luego de que fueron declarados marido y mujer todos nos paramos a aplaudirlos y nos dirigimos hacia la entrada para arrojarles arroz en su salida. Posamos para fotos de recuerdo junto a los recién casados y luego fuimos hacia el local donde llevaría a cabo la recepción. Alex viajo conmigo en mi auto, junto con otros invitados a quienes di un aventón. En el local mientras esperábamos la llegada de los novios, Alex termino de presentarme a su familia y otros amigos cercanos a la familia. Muchas chicas me comían con la mirada, me pidieron autógrafos, me pidieron posar para fotos; sabía que esto le molestaba a mi novia, pero nunca me reprocho nada. Me senté en la mesa principal junto a los padres de los novios. Me sentí poco incómodo, aunque internamente quería formar parte de esta familia. Alex insistió en que yo soy parte de ella, pero creo que lo hizo para no dejarme a mi suerte con todas esas fans por ahí de invitadas. Los novios llegaron y luego de palabras de agradecimiento, brindis y otras tradiciones que acostumbran aquí, los novios tuvieron su primer baile que fue un ligero vals. Nuevamente aplaudimos a los novios y Andres me hizo una seña indicándome que era momento para mi sorpresa. Me levante de la mesa, mientras la nueva música sonaba, la llaman pasodoble es otro baile tradicional. -¿A dónde vas? – me detuvo mi novia. -Voy al baño, ahora regreso – deposite un beso en su frente y corrí hacia el estacionamiento por mi guitarra. Regrese justo a tiempo para cuando el maestro de ceremonias anunciaba mi número. -Ahora tenemos un pequeño número para los recién casados de parte del cuñado del novio – todo mundo murmuro felizmente por la broma sobre mí y mi novia. Los novios se sentaron en la mesa. Me dieron un pequeño banco, acomodaron el micrófono y yo sitúe mi guitarra. Mire hacia la mesa donde mi novia tenía una mirada interrogante. -Buenas noches con todos los presentes, como saben soy Josh el novio de Alex, la hermana de Andrés – todos reían ante mi nerviosismo – De corazón deseo que los recién casados tengan una vida feliz, el amor entre ellos flota en el aire así que no dudo de que son el uno para el otro. Ahora dedicaré una canción, espero me disculpen por aprovecharme de su tiempo, pero va para mi novia.- todos ríen nuevamente y busco a Alex con la mirada. Cuando sus ojos encuentran los míos toco las primares notas de la canción. ( Estaciones – Pacho Marchán : www_youtube_com/watch?v=zzs4hwqD7gM ) . Gracias al frío de hoy hoy puedo acercarme puedo darte mi calor ofrecerte mis brazos brindarte todo mi amor es tan perfecto Y si sale el sol me encantaría mirar tus ojos, hombros, tu piel y el color el brillo en tu cabello que combina en tu interior yo estoy seguro Que hoy quiero agradecerle a Dios por vos por la lluvia y por el calor por el frío y el resplandor que producen tus ojos con la luna o sol amor que hoy quiero cantarte a ti y agradecerle a la vida que te tengo aquí que no me importa el mundo si no estás junto a mí Escucho muchos \"Awww\" \"owww\" y suspiros por parte del público, pero lo único que me hace feliz es su mirada en mí. Su sonrisa, sus ojos, el amor que me muestra. Todo eso solo para mí. Soy tan afortunado. Que en verano en otoño tu pelo se ve bien ya sea suelto o con moño las hojas de los árboles que juegan con el viento hacen que tu parezcas la princesa de mi cuento y en invierno hace frío pero no se compara cuando tú no estás conmigo todo se vuelve triste todo se encuentra vacío eres la primavera que llega a entibiar mi río Que hoy quiero agradecerle a Dios por vos por la lluvia y por el calor por el frío y por el resplandor que producen tus ojos con la luna o sol amor que hoy quiero cantarte a ti y agradecerle a la vida que te tengo aquí que no me importa el mundo si no estás junto a mí Sus ojos me miran con amor, quiero que sepa que cada palabra que le canto sale directamente de mi corazón. Que estas palabras son solo para ella, que agradezco a la vida por ponerla en camino, que ella es mi vida, nunca, nunca la dejaré ir porque están necesaria como el aire para seguir viviendo. Que quiero ser rayo de sol que seca aquella lágrima en tu corazón regalarte mi vida en una canción regalarte el sonido de un te quiero eres el agua en mi desierto quiero ser parte de ti ser las cuatro estaciones que te harán feliz ser tu mundo en la mañana ser el ángel que te cuida en plena madrugada ser el viento que te toca ser la lluvia que te moja se desliza por tu boca dibujar una sonrisa en tus labios muy despacio no importa el tiempo no hay prisa -Te Amo Alex – todo el mundo aplaude mientras me retiro. Con mi guitarra voy a su encuentro. Ella ya está parada esperando por mí. Le doy la guitarra a Santiago que ha llegado a donde estamos. Tomo sus manos y la acerco a mí. -Te amo Josh – ella es quien junta nuestro labios en un beso dulce, tímido. Aplausos suenan a nuestro alrededor pero siento que solo somos ella y yo. Nos separamos lentamente, nuestras miradas dicen todo lo que queremos decir - Creo que ahora es mi turno. Ella me deja ahí y si acerca a Andrés. Conversa con él y luego van hacia el Dj. Me quedo parado siguiéndola con la mirada. Ella toma el micrófono y se acerca al centro del salón. -NO puedo creerlo – la mamá de Alex me sorprende – Va a cantar. Ella tiene pánico escénico cuando canta. -¿En serio? – le pregunto porque muchas veces le he visto cantar con público. -Ella canta en un karaoke o con sus amigos, donde el número no supere a treinta personas – tiene razón – pero no se atreve cuando hay tanto público por eso no acepto ser la solista en el grupo de Diego. Aquí estamos casi 300 personas, si va a cantar por ti en verdad te quiere. Mi corazón se derrite. Por suerte no tuve que responder por que la voz de mi novia sonó en los parlantes. -Hola a todos, familia y amigos. En verdad esta noche es muy especial para nuestra familia. Les agradezco su presencia para festejar nuestra felicidad. Ahora tengo una nueva hermana, eso me hace muy feliz porque la verdad mi hermano ya me tenía harta, necesitaba más de poder femenino – todos ríen ante su broma – Todos aquí somos testigos de su amor, muchos envidiaran ese sentimiento tan verdadero que ellos tiene. De corazón deseo su mayor felicidad. Ahora voy a quitarles otra vez el protagonismo de esta noche porque necesito compartirles una pequeña historia. Era verdad, el amor entre los nuevos esposos se notaba a metros de distancia. Ellos eres definitivamente e uno para el otro – Hace un año maso menos estuve en otro país, lejos de mi familia en un nuevo mundo. Conocí un chico. Mejor dicho choque con un chico. Nuestra forma de presentación no fue exactamente la mejor ni común – sonrío al recordad como choque con ella en esas escaleras – él era especial, diferente. Venia de un mundo muy distinto al mío. Pero también era muy lindo, dulce y terriblemente arrogante. En algún momento llegamos a ser muy buenos amigos, de esos que son uña y mugre, obviamente él era la mugre. Todos reían ante sus ocurrencias, en especial yo porque sabía exactamente a qué se refería – Por cuestiones de la vida y los típicos malentendidos nos alejamos. Regrese aquí con mi familia sin despedirme, sin decirle donde buscarme. Solo tenía buenos recuerdos de ese lindo chico. Pero el destino, Dios, yo que sé, nos juntó. Él mundo resulto ser de lo más pequeño y ahora lo tengo aquí. Es mi amigo, mi confidente, mi novio. Sigue siendo ese chico dulce, sincero y arrogante, por supuesto. Y lo más importante… lo amo. Muchos Awsss hicieron eco cuando una canción empezó a sonar. No la había escuchado pero sería una de mis favoritas por el hecho de que ella me lo cantará. Y así lo hizo. Como siempre, cuando nuestras miradas se encontraron y todo el mundo desapareció. Solo escucha su voz cantando cada nota. (Algo más – Quinta estación : www_youtube_com/watch?v=VQpB_Ftox7w ) Es algo más que la distancia que el dolor y la nostalgia sabemos que eso no nos va a separar Es darte un beso cada noche que tus manos me enamoren y que lo nuestro crezca cada día más Porque somos algo más... Siempre admiro la pasión con lo que hace todo. Es de esas personas que trasmite todo lo que tiene y siente en lo que hace. Es por es que sé que es sincera con sus palabras. Ella me ama. Soy un maldito afortunado por tenerla. Ella es todo lo que quiero. Y yo sé que no es querer porque en tus ojos yo me puedo perder contigo olvido lo que es temer acaso no sabes que tú eres para mí la noche, el día en mi vivir la sangre en mis venas lo doy todo por ti contigo el mundo no tiene final y el tiempo no se nos va a acabar Y con esa estrofa termino transformando mi corazón en gelatina. Cuando terminó la canción hubo muchos aplausos por parte de los invitados por su impecable interpretación. Pude notar lo difícil que era, no soy un experto en música pero las notas eran difícil. La voz de mi novia era envidiable, definitivamente ella debería dedicarse a eso. Se acercó a mí y la recibí con los brazos abiertos. Le susurre un \"te amo\" en su oído y ella me susurró un \"yo también\". -Bueno tórtolos su momento ya ha pasado, ahora vamos a festejar – Andrés nos saca de nuestro trance mientras la música suena y lleva a su esposa a la pista de baile. Bailamos como hace mucho tiempo no lo hacíamos. Baile con mi nova, con Fernanda, con mi suegra hasta con Diana. El único momento en el que me sentí incomodo fue cuando Alex bailo con Darío. Tuve que contener a mis puños para no romperle la cara cuando la saco a bailar. Aprovecho un baile lento, y coloco sus brazos en la cintura de mi novia. Solo podía verlos hablar, reír. Mierda. Quería saber de qué hablaban, porque se reían, era mi novia. Yo era el único con derecho de hacerla reír. No podía evitar los celos, pero tuve que evitar la confrontación. No podía pelear con mi novia. Debía confiar en ella, debía recordar que ella me amaba. Apenas terminaron de bailar fui hacia ella. La bese un poco desesperado. Santiago tuvo que llamarnos la atención para evitar que alguien nos viera en la situación un poco comprometedora en la que terminamos. Salimos hacia el jardín que tenía el local. Era muy hermoso y acogedor. Una gran pileta iluminada rodeada de flores de varios colores con reflectores hacía un ambiente romántico. La tome de la cintura y nos sentamos en la pequeña banca que daba frente a la pileta. Nos acurrucamos muy juntos. -La boda estuvo perfecta. Ellos se veían muy felices – ella rompió el silencio. -Si fue perfecta – besé su frente - ¿Quisieras que tu boda fuera de esta manera? – mi curiosidad ante sus deseos fue más grande que mi miedo a incomodarla con ese tema. En verdad estoy seguro de que compartiré mi vida con ella y quiero darle la boda de sus sueños cuando eso ocurra y sería muy bueno tener una idea. -La verdad sí, es muy bonito una boda tradicional. Primero el matrimonio civil y luego por la iglesia. Aun sueño entrar vestida de blanco, caminar hacia mi futuro marido, y todos los que me quieren ahí, apoyándome en esa nueva vida. Aunque… -¿Aunque? -Quizás sea egoísta pero una vez escuche un mito que si tuviera la oportunidad lo quisiera cumplir. -¿Mmmm? - ¿Has escuchado sobre Le Temple de l'Amour? – negué con mi cabeza – bueno, se considera una tradición casarse un 14 de febrero en alguna capilla o sitio donde haya una representación de cupido. Ya sea en Londres, Grecia, Francia, Roma; cualquier lugar. El mito es que si te casas en esa fecha junto a cupido, tu amor será bendecido por los dioses. Nada ni nadie los podrá separar porque es un lazo puro que existirá para siempre. -¿Así que sueñas con casarte en alguno de esos sitios? ¿Qué tiene de egoísta? -Bueno, el sueño consiste en que solo mi futuro marido y yo nos escapemos juntos y nos casemos en ese templo. Solo nosotros dos. De todos los sitios que he visto quisiera que sea en Le Temple de l'Amour. Es algo casi imposible, nunca se ha celebrado una boda en ese lugar. Quiero ser la primera en unir mi vida con esa persona que ame tanto en ese lugar. Una punzada de dolor me atraviesa cunado ella se refiere a otra persona para compartir su vida. Ella no tiene planes conmigo en el futuro. Quizás sea porque aun duda de mis sentimientos o aun duda de que nosotros estaremos siempre juntos. Yo ya he planificado mi vida a su lado, cualquier otra cosa es impensable. Trato de no afligirme por ello. Tengo que lograr ser ese hombre con el que ella sueña en escaparse a ese lugar especial. -¿Y en dónde está? Me imagino que en Francia por el nombre. -En el Jardín Inglés del Petit Trianon en Versalles – recuerdo haber escuchado sobre el Pequeño Trianon. Es un palacio en Francia construido al estilo griego. Los jardines de Versalles son muy conocidos. Nunca he ido ahí pero me han dicho que son maravillosos. -¿Así que te gusta lo griego? -La verdad es que sí. Siempre me han interesado los mitos, historias griegas y romanas. Me encanta conocer nuevas cosas sobre las diferentes culturas. Algún día tendré que conocer todas las maravillas del mundo. Es uno de mis deseos. -Espero que me incluyas en tu viaje – acuno su rostro entre mis manos para poder mirarla a los ojos. -Eres el único con quien quiero compartir ese viaje – me besó. Tierno. Dulce. Suave. Perfecto. Como todos sus besos. Sus palabras más la dulzura de sus actos me hace amarla aún más. Si eso es posible. Con ella siento que soy real. Siento que soy único, especial, amado. No importa mi fama, mi dinero, mis defectos. Solo importa lo que ella ve en mí. Por eso es que la amo tanto, porque ella me hace ser y sentirme una mejor persona, porque no hay nada más especial que esto que tenemos. Así estuvimos un momento más. Solo degustando el uno del otro. Temiendo el momento en que tengamos que separarnos, pero amando cada instante que permanecemos juntos. Volvimos a la fiesta más tarde. Pero ahora éramos otros. Nos amábamos. Yo la amaba y haría cualquier cosa en este mundo para que esto nuca se acabe. Todo estuvo espectacular. Desde que había confesado mis verdaderos sentimientos, la relación con mi novia dio un giro de 360°. Cada segundo que pasamos juntos se siente como único. Todo es maravilloso cuando estoy con ella. Hasta ver una simple película con ella es un momento especial. Pero tuve que regresar. Tuve que dejar a la chica de mis sueños. A la dueña de mi corazón. Tuve que volver a mi país. A mi trabajo, a mi vida, con mi familia. Mi corazón se rompió otro poco, como cada vez que me despedía de ella. Tendría que esperar hasta febrero, sus próximas vacaciones para poder verla. Si iba antes, mis suegros se enfadarían por interferir en sus estudios. Además dudo que ella me preste la suficiente atención cuando está estudiando. No quiero ser un estorbo y no quiero que se sienta mal por no dedicarle el tiempo necesario. Pero contaba cada día, cada minuto hasta poder verla de nuevo. Ni todas las videollamadas, ni llamadas telefónicas, mensajes, nada compensaba el tenerla tan lejos de mí. Hola de nuevo..! lamento por no haber actualizado antes, he estado muy llena y no he podido escribir un nuevo capítulo pero para que no desesperen les dejo aki este :) espero que les guste Como le dije ya tengo listo el capítulo (CAP 41) donde en verdad la historia comenzara. era lo que tenia planeado desde un inicio pero no quise llegar muy pronto ahí. Espero leer los comentarios sobre la música que he adjuntado, algunas quizás nunca hayan escuchado, pero esa es la idea, que conozcamos cosas nuevas. agradezco sus sugerencias, como han visto algunas ya la hemos usado. lo difícil es encontrar la situación, por eso cada cierto tiempo hago un capítulo donde pueda ponerlos :) así que los tendrán. Quisiera su opinión sobre la canción que Josh canto. la verdad cuando escuche el cover me enamore de la letras. supe que era lo que buscaba, algo sencillo pero profundo :) ahora tengo una nueva canción favorita :) del mismo cantante encontré otra canción que la usaremos mas adelante. es igualmente precisa para el momento. Gracias por sus reviews y pm... y les pido que sigan dejándolos por que esa es mi recompensa, no les toma mas de un minuto :) NOS LEEMOS LUEGO AVANCE: -Lo siento Alex. -¿Lo sientes, porque? -Porque no puedo dejar de amarte, porque cada vez que te tengo cerca quiero tenerte entre mis brazos y besarte. Porque cada vez que te veo con él me siento como un estúpido por haberte perdido, por haber prácticamente arrojado a sus brazos. Lo siento, lo siento por no poder ser solo tu amigo. Lo siento, por esto… - Milet 3[Chapter 40] Capítulo 40 -Hola hermosa – la voz de Darío me saca de mi sueño en el auto de Santy. En lugar de haber dormido anoche, pase en internet para ver la premier de Catching Fire y poder ver a mi novio. Muchos le preguntaron por nuestra relación, sobre los videos que misteriosamente llegaron a las redes de Josh dedicándome una canción en la boda de mi hermano igualmente mi propio video con mi canción. No me gustaron los comentarios que decía que yo usaba la fama de mi novio para lanzarme de cantante; esa no era mi idea, esa nunca he querido ser famosa y mucho menos estoy interesada en la fama de mi novio. También había fotos de nosotros, fotos privadas que solo Josh y yo poseíamos. Traté de hacer que no me importe, pero la verdad es que si me molestaba el no tener mis propios recuerdos y que estén en la boca de todos. -¿Alex? Tierra llamando a la luna – Darío me saca de mi ensoñación cuando chasquea los dedos e mi frente. -Perdón, me perdí en mis pensamientos. -Un millón de dólares por saber en qué piensas – dice acomodándose a mi lado en el asiento de atrás. -No es nada. -Vamos Alex. Somos amigos. Confía en mí- y lo hice, le conté todo sobre la prensa. Por los acosos, por las fotos de nosotros, muchas que solo las teníamos Josh y yo. Ya no puedo salir de mi casa en paz con amigos porque al siguiente día hay una noticia de que engaño a Josh o cualquier mentira más – Hermosa, cuando te hiciste novia de Josh sabías que cosas así pasarían. Pero no debe importarte lo que digan de ti. Los que te queremos sabemos que cosas son ciertas y cuáles no. En cuanto a sus fotos privadas, puede que Josh las publique, no quiero hablar mal de él, pero desde que ustedes empezaron su popularidad ha subido mucho. -Josh es incapaz de hacer eso, él sabe que odio la prensa. No pudo hacer eso. -Yo solo decía. Mejor trata de no afligirte y vamos por un café. Luego te llevaré al médico. Tu mamá me pidió que te lo recuerde y me parece muy mal que olvides algo tan importante como tu salud. -No tú también, no quiero regaños – le digo haciendo un puchero. -Nada de es señorita, tu salud es muy importante. Tú sobre todas las personas debe estar pendiente de ir al médico. – le sonreí y partimos hacia una cafetería. Luego de nuestro café me acompaño al médico que hizo todos los exámenes que correspondían. Por suerte ahora solo era una revisión cada 6 meses. En algún momento llegue a odiar ser una paciente. Así pasaron los días. La navidad llego en un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Darío me acompaño a hacer las compras de navidad. Últimamente pasábamos más tiempo juntos. Era inevitable, después de todo alguna vez fuimos amigos, no era algo que podía tapar con un dedo. La navidad fue muy bonita. Noche buena con mi familia y amigos. Por supuesto con una llamada de mi novio. Me hizo llegar un pequeño regalo con su abuelo. Fue un hermoso perro peluche que abrazaba una almohada donde la foto de nosotros dos, que nos tomamos en la boda de mi hermano y usamos de perfil en las redes sociales, estaba pintada. Amo sus detalles. Amo que recuerde esas pequeñas cosas que vivimos. Lo que más extraño de él son precisamente los detalles que suelen pasar desapercibidos. Como aprieta mi mano cuando esta tenso. Como levanta sus cejas cuando piensa algo sucio. Como pasa sus dedos por su cabello cuando esta frustrado. Sus pucheros absurdos cuando trata de convencerme de algo. Son esas las cosas que más me hacen añorarle. La navidad vino y se fue. Hoy era año viejo. Mi familia y la familia de mis amigos asistimos al centro de la ciudad, donde veremos un espectáculo de fuegos artificiales cuando el nuevo año empiece. Nos encontramos con Fer, Santy, Darío, mis primos y primas. Todos hablamos de muchas cosas, reíamos, aún faltaban casi 4 horas para la media noche. -Alguien debe ir por la bolsa de intenciones a mi auto – dijo Santiago. Desde que éramos pequeños teníamos la tradición de apuntar en unos papelitos nuestras intenciones, propósito y deseos el primer día del año; y el último día lo quemábamos. -Yo voy – dije poniéndome de pie y tomando las llaves de su auto. -Te acompaño – dijo Darío. Nos encaminamos hacia el auto, atravesando la multitud de gente. Caminamos hablando de tonterías. Riendo. Cuando llegamos al auto no encontrábamos la bolsita. Buscamos en la guantera, en los bolsillos de los asientos pero no había rastro de nuestra bolsita. Ambos nos subimos en el asiento trasero para buscarla. La encontramos en el portamaletas. Ambos nos apoyamos en el asiento para impulsarnos atrás y cogerla pero algo nos hizo perder el equilibrio y caímos ambos en el portamaletas. Yo estaba sobre él prácticamente y nuestras carcajadas no se hicieron esperar. Nos miramos por un momento aun sonriendo cuando su mirada se tornó seria. -Lo siento Alex. -¿Lo sientes, porque? -Porque no puedo dejar de amarte, porque cada vez que te tengo cerca quiero tenerte entre mis brazos y besarte. Porque cada vez que te veo con él me siento como un estúpido por haberte perdido, por haber prácticamente arrojado a sus brazos. Lo siento, lo siento por no poder ser solo tu amigo. Lo siento, por esto… Antes de que yo pueda reaccionar tenía sus labios sobre los míos. Sus manos atrayéndome hacia él. Su beso era desesperado, sus labios que antes se sentían suaves ahora eran duros, groseros. Nada se comparaba a los besos de Josh, los cuales a pesar de que podrían ser duros y pasionales eran dulces y delicados. Darío movía con fuerza sus labios. Su lengua acariciaba mi labio inferior intentando profundizar el beso. Una parte de mí, muy pequeña quiso responder a ese beso. Quizás fue la costumbre, se sentía tan familiar, tan normal besarlo. Mis labios temblaban, mi cuerpo temblaba, no sé como pero ahora él estaba sobre mí. El aún me besaba, yo solo estaba quieta pero no lo apartaba. No quería causarle más dolor. Suficiente provoque cuando lo deje por Josh. Maldita sea. ¡Josh!. Tomo todas mis fuerzas apartarlo. Logre que soltara mis labios aunque la posición de nuestros cuerpos era la misma. Su respiración era agitada. Nuestras miradas se encontraron y pude ver el dolor en ellos. Cerré con fuerza mis párpados, esto debía ser una pesadilla, una broma de mal gusto. Sentí que una gota cayó sobre mi mejilla. Cuando abrí mis ojos pude ver sus lágrimas. Mi corazón literalmente se rompió. Verlo llorar por mi culpa era una punzada directo a mi corazón. Logre sentarme y lo abrace. Lo atraje hacia mí y el vino sin resistirse. Oculto su rostro en mi cuello, su aliento y sus lágrimas en mi piel. Mis ojos también rebosaban de lágrimas. Él era mi amigo, a pesar de todo siempre estuvo para mí. Lo amé. Lo amé mucho, pero ya no. Mi corazón pertenece a otra persona. Nos quedamos así por un momento. Luego fue el quien rompió el silencio. -Lo único que quiero es que seas feliz, mi amor. Es lo único con lo que puedo sobrevivir, saber que tú encontraste la felicidad. Si algún día cambias de opinión, yo estaré esperándote con los brazos abiertos. Siempre estarán dispuestos para ti. Ahora solo permíteme ser tu amigo, te prometo que no volveré a besarte si tu no quieres, pero por favor no me alejes. Eso me rompería. -No lo haré, te lo prometo – nos quedamos abrazados por otro rato. Luego decidimos bajar del auto. Caminamos por entre la multitud, hasta que abrí mi boca para recordarle algo necesario - Darío, yo…. Yo le diré a Josh lo que sucedió. No puedo mentirle. -Lo entiendo. Si él me patea el trasero por besar a su chica lo entenderé. Y si tienes algún problema por eso, solo dímelo. Le diré la verdad. Yo fui el que te beso. -Gracias – me regalo una sonrisa que no llego a sus ojos. Este chico siempre será importante para mí. No lo amo como antes, pero lo quiero y no quiero perderlo. Cuando nos acercamos a nuestros amigos mi celular vibró. En la pantalla apareció el nombre de mi novio, mi estómago dio un vuelco. No sé qué hacer. Pienso en no contestarle, pero eso solo traerá más preguntas. Cuando la segunda ronda de timbrazos empieza decido contestar. -Amor, te extrañado mucho. Como quisiera que estuvieras aquí a mi lado – sonrío antes sus palabras - ¿Por qué no contestaste antes? -Yo también te extraño amor, lo siento, el ruido no me permitió escuchar la llamada. -No lo lamentes, preciosa. Antes de que me cuentes en donde estás tienes que prometerme algo. -¿prometerte algo? Mmmmm depende de lo que sea. -Nada malo, solo debes prometerme que la próxima vez estarás conmigo para festejar el nuevo año. Pienso en viajar contigo a Australia y ser los primero en festejarlo. Tú y yo juntos, sin nadie más. Por favor mi vida. Solo di que sí. -Si Josh, es lo que más quisiera. Te lo prometo. -TÚ me haces feliz princesa. No sabes cómo te amo. -Yo también te amo mucho – le digo. Lo amo. Lo amo mucho, pero no sé cómo decirle lo que acaba de pasar con Darío. No quiero que se enoje, no quiero que piense que lo engañe. -¿Qué pasa princesa? No me digas que nada porque te conozco bien –mi pulso se acelera. Mi garganta se cierra. No sé cómo decirle, tengo miedo. Mucho miedo de perderle - ¿Alex? ¿Qué está mal? -Josh… - las palabras forman un nudo – Josh… -¡¿Josh?! ¡¿Josh qué...?! – Me pregunta molesto – Mierda. Tenía un mal presentimiento, sabía que algo malo pasaba. Dime que pasa Alexandra. Ahora. -Darío me besó – lo se dije casi susurrando, pero era la verdad y esperaba que me creyera o por lo menos me dejara explicarle. Lo amo. No quiero perderlo. HOLAAAA.. Perdonen la ausencia.. pero ando un poco atareada..! ¿Que les pareció? como les dije tendremos el capítulo donde la historia empezará con su giro.. 41...41...41..! en verdad kisiera saber que opinan xfavorxfavor dejen sus reviews.. eso es lo q m anima a seguir escribiendo.. cuando no hay reviews me desanimo un poco.. no les toma ni un minuto :( quiero saber que creen q pasara .. si tienen alguna sospecha... ademas sigan mandando sus recomendaciones musicales.. como han viso algunas ya han salido pero otras lo harán pronto.. solo busco el momento indicado..! Les dejo una sorpresa: fue la sinopsis q escribi para la historia pero tiene limites de caracteres asi que lo recorte.. aki va: Alex regresa de su viaje de estudio de los Estados Unidos a su país natal en Latinoamérica… de regreso a su vida real, mejor dicho su vida normal… su familia, sus amigos, universidad, sus amores… pero hay algo que ella no espera encontrarse, alguien que conoció durante su viaje, alguien famoso que ella tuvo el disgusto de conocer, con quien vivió buenos momentos pero también momentos decepcionantes. En su reencuentro crecerá un gran amor ¿Quién diría que un amor de cuento de hadas, tan hermoso y perfecto puede estar rodeado de tantas inseguridades? En verdad espero mns y reviews suyos... animenme a seguir con la historia :) AVANCE: -¿Qué? NOO..! Josh escúchame. -¿Qué quieres que te escuche? – Me estoy rompiendo – que lo besaste, que te diste cuenta de que lo amas a él y lo nuestro es un error ¿es eso? Porque si es así no es necesario que me lo digas, ya lo sé. Escucho que solloza por el teléfono, y me siento tan culpable por herirla, pero ella me hirió a mi primero. Trato de tranquilizarme, por ella, porque la amo y no quiero que llore – Perdóname Alex, solo dime lo que tienes que decirme. -Vete al diablo, Josh... Piensa lo que quieras, no quiero saber nada de ti – y con eso corto la llamada.[Chapter 41] Capítulo 41 -Darío me beso – sentí como mi mundo quería caerse en pedazos. En todo el día tuve una sensación de ansiedad. No sabía porque. Sabía que algo malo ocurriría y ahora siento un gran dolor en mi corazón. Si ella lo había besado es porque aun lo ama, con ese beso debió darse cuenta de que lo prefiere a él antes que a mí. - ¿No dices nada? -No soy yo el que debe hablar- estoy enojado, frustrado, triste, desolado y quiere que yo de explicaciones. -Josh te lo estoy diciendo porque no quiero que haya secretos entre nosotros, la confianza es la base de toda relación. Solo quiero que me dejes explicarte como paso, para poder… -¿Dejarme por él? – solo la idea me ahoga. -¿Qué? NOO..! Josh escúchame. -¿Qué quieres que te escuche? – Me estoy rompiendo – que lo besaste, que te diste cuenta de que lo amas a él y lo nuestro es un error ¿es eso? Porque si es así no es necesario que me lo digas, ya lo sé. Escucho que solloza por el teléfono, y me siento tan culpable por herirla, pero ella me hirió a mi primero. Trato de tranquilizarme, por ella, porque la amo y no quiero que llore – Perdóname Alex, solo dime lo que tienes que decirme. -Vete al diablo, Josh... Piensa lo que quieras, no quiero saber nada de ti – y con eso corto la llamada. Mis manos se cierran y forman puños. Golpeo el marco de la puerta lleno de frustración. Mi mamá viene a verme cuando el estruendo por arrojar mi lámpara le advirtió de mi humor. Me siento en mi cama y cubro mi rostro con mis manos, no voy a llorar. No lo haré. -Diablos Josh ¿Qué sucede? -Ella me dejo – es lo único que puedo decir. Mi madre se sienta a mi lado y me abraza. Cuando logra tranquilizarme le cuento sobre la llamada, ella me escucha pacientemente, cuando termino me ve con rostro de molestia - ¿Qué? -Eres un tontito Josh. Tendrás que llamarla y disculparte. Espero que no te la ponga difícil, que no sea cabezota como tú. -No escuchaste que ella me dejo por él. -Lo que escuche es que mi hijo es un dramático, que asume cosas que no son y termina haciendo daño a otras personas y a él mismo – yo la miro seriamente, se supone que debe apoyarme – Alex fue sincera, ella te ama y por eso no te oculto lo que paso, quería que tú confiaras en ella. Pero tú solo la acusaste de traicionarte, de no amarte, de dejarte. Asumiste lo peor Josh, tú mismo la empujaste lejos. No pensaste que tal vez sea como ella lo dijo. Él la beso. Él. No ella. Ahora más vale que encuentres la forma de hablar con ella. No es buena idea que comiencen el año disgustados. Me quedo pensando en las palabras de mi mamá. Me doy cuenta de que tiene razón, de que asumí lo peor y me deje arrastrar por la ira. Tomo mi teléfono y marco su número. No contesta. Me envía a buzón. Intento de nuevo y de nuevo y nada. -Soy un estúpido – golpeo con mi puño la pared. -Es obvio que no te contestará. Tienes otra forma de comunicarla, el número de su hermano de un amigo, alguien que te pueda ayudar – tiene razón. Marco el número de Santiago y al tercer timbrazo me contesta. -¿Josh, que sucedió con Alex? -¿Esta ella bien? Necesito hablar con ella. -Esta con Fernanda. La llevó a tomar aire porque estaba llorando y no quería que su familia la viera así. Pero dime que sucedió. -Tu hermano. Fui un estúpido Santiago. Fui el mayor de los estúpidos. Necesito hablar con ella. -No estoy seguro de cómo ayudarte, pero… - su voz se desvaneció al otro lado. -¿Josh? – otra vez mi ira burbujeaba. -¿Estas contento de lo que provocas Darío? -No, no lo estoy. Pero tú eres el estúpido por herirla y creer que ella te engañaría. Fui yo quien la beso. Ella no me correspondió. -Se eso – le grito. -Ahora lo sabes. Deberías haberlo sabido antes de ser un idiota con ella – eso fue un golpe a mi estómago. Tiene razón. Tiene malditamente toda la razón. – Nunca me gustaste Josh, pero como yo tengo gran parte de culpa en esto haré que hables con ella. Llámame en 15 minutos y más te vale preparar una buena disculpa. Maldigo mil veces por depender de ese estúpido para recuperarla. Si la pierdo por esto no sé cómo seguir. Soy un tonto, un celoso, pesimista. No la merezco. Pero soy tan egoísta como para no rendirme. Los minutos parecen horas. Mi mamá me observa caminar por mi habitación, ella solo está ahí, apoyándome. Ms dedos tiembla cuando marco nuevamente el número de Santiago. Al tercer timbrazo contestan. -¿Josh? – su voz hace que mi corazón salte. -Alex por favor, perdóname, perdóname fui un idiota. El mayor de los idiotas, me deje llevar por los celos, por la ira. Te amo y tengo mucho miedo de perderte, tengo miedo de que te des cuenta que no soy lo suficientemente bueno para ti y me dejes. Mi amor, necesito que perdones mis estupideces… no puedo vivir sin ti… te amo. Ella se queda callada por un momento. Su silencio me mata, es como si mi vida se escapara lentamente mientras espero su respuesta – Te amo Josh – todo el aire que estaba reteniendo se escapa. -Te amo, te amo mucho, muchísimo, más que a mi propia vida princesa. ¿Me perdonas? -Sí, Josh. Temía que respondieras de esa forma. Tenía miedo de perderte, de que creyeras que te engañe, creí que estaba preparada para tu reacción, pero no. Me dolió mucho. – una punzada de culpa me atraviesa- Darío dijo que debía comprenderte, que él también hubiera actuado de esa manera. -Gracias mi amor, te prometo. Te juro que te escucharé la próxima vez que algo así pase. -Esperemos que no haya una próxima vez- me la imagino sonriendo. -Te amo, Alex. Eres mi vida, eres mi razón para despertarme cada día, la dueña de mis sueños, de mis anhelos. Tienes razón cuando dijiste que la confianza es básica es una relación. Y lo es. Aunque a veces la verdad pueda doler, es necesaria. Te amo pequeña, es por eso que reaccione así, no porque no confíe en ti, sino porque soy inseguro de mí mismo. -Yo soy la que no es lo suficientemente buena para ti, Josh. No tienes que dudar que te amé. Nunca lo hagas. Por favor. -No la haré. Te lo prometo. – desde ahí hablamos por más de una hora. Evitamos el problema que tuvimos y hablamos de las cosas que queremos para nuestro nuevo año. Nuestro planes, nuestros deseos, todo lo que queremos hacer juntos. De pronto un gran estruendo se escuchó en su lado. Los fuegos artificiales seguramente estallaban. -Bueno aquí ya es año nuevo. Feliz año mi amor. – aquí falta casi una hora. El tiempo con ella se me fue volando. -Feliz Año mi amor. Espero que este nuevo año sea el mejor, que podamos estar juntos, que podamos seguir amándonos, juntos. Siempre juntos. -Yo igual – me dice ella – es hora que vaya a desear feliz año a los demás. Felicita de mi parte a tu familia y más te vale disfrutar la fiesta de tus amigos hoy. -Si estuvieras conmigo seguro la disfrutaría – después de medianoche, Avan me recogerá para ir a la fiesta de año nuevo de unos amigos. Le conté a Alex y ella quiere que lo disfrute ¿Cómo la disfrutaré sin ella? -El próximo año estaremos juntos ¿lo recuerdas? Ahora me voy. Te amo, Josh. -Te amo, Alex. Más de lo que puedes imaginarte – con un beso muy sonado corta la llamada. Mi corazón vuelve a seguir su ritmo. Gracias al cielo que no la perdí. No sé qué hubiera hecho de ser el caso. Salgo de mi habitación hacia la sala. Mi familia estaba de visita y solo me separe de ellos para llamar a mi novia. Me siento avergonzado por que ellos noten lo tonto que fui. Por suerte todos comprendieron, mi mamá les había hablado de la situación. Cuando la media noche llego, todos nos deseamos éxitos en el nuevo año. Luego me despedí cuando Avan llego por mí. La fiesta era en el salón de un hotel. Cuando llegamos saludamos a todos nuestros conocidos. Charlamos, bailamos, bromeamos, tomamos. De todo un poco. -Hola Josh – la vocecita de Shannon interrumpió mi charla con mi amigo Logan. Sacudí mi cabeza para enfrentarla. Mi humor no soportaría sus sermones. -Hola Shannon – ella me sonrío. Logan se fue para dejarnos solos. Ella levanto una copa con una bebida rosa. -Acéptala Josh, vengo en son de paz – tomo con recelo la copa que me ofrece – solo quería disculparme por mi actitud. Reflexione y me di cuenta de que tienes razón, lo nuestro ya es pasado. Lo único que quiero es que me permitas ser tu amiga, por lo viejos tiempos. Su declaración parecía sincera. Ella me sonríe y le devuelvo la sonrisa - ¿Amigos? – me pregunta alzando su copa. -Amigos – asiento y chocamos nuestras copas. Bebí todo el contenido de mi vaso. Me fui hacia el baño por mis urgencias fisiológicas. Me sentía un poco mareado. Cuando caminaba de regreso al salón de fiesta alguien tapo mis ojos. Cuando pude apartar sus manos y gire, me encontré con una gran sorpresa. Ahí frente a mí, estaba mi novia. Tan hermosa como siempre, sus rizos alborotados, su mirada penetrante. - ¿cómo? – le pregunte. Era imposible que ella estuviese aquí. No me respondió, simplemente se abalanzo sobre mí y se posesionó de mis labios con un beso hambriento. Me arrastro hacia los elevadores que estaban tras nosotros. Nunca rompimos nuestro beso mientras subíamos por el ascensor y me arrastraba hacia una habitación. No sé cómo consiguió ese cuarto pero ahí estábamos, besándonos con desesperación. Nuestra ropa volaba por todas partes, nuestros labios seguían luchando. Caímos en la cama, éramos un montón de brazos y piernas. Nuestra ropa interior también se fue y entré en ella. La hice mi mujer como lo he estado deseando. Quizás fue un poco pasional, esperaba hacer que su primera vez fuera especial y dulce no como ahora, pero ya no había nada que hacer. Caímos rendidos luego de llegar al éxtasis. La acerqué a mí y la envolví con mi cuerpo. Mis ojos se cerraban por el cansancio. Con mi último aliento le susurré en su oído: -Te amo Alex, más que a nada, te amo – y así caí en los brazos de Morfeo. Soñando por lo que paso esta noche, soñando con una vida a su lado. Me desperté por el sonido de mi celular. Tenía programada la alarma todos estos días para ir a correr temprano en las mañanas. Mi pantalón estaba en el suelo junto a la cama, lo alcance y lo apague. Tarde un momento en reconocer que esta no era mi habitación. Mi cabeza daba vueltas, palpitaba. Trate de recordar que paso sin moverme mucho por miedo a que las náuseas me atraviesen. Recordé la fiesta, recordé mi charla con Shannon. Una imagen de mi novia en este sitio vino a mi mente. Ella y yo pasamos la noche juntos, pero eso es imposible, ella está lejos. Cuando hablamos anoche ella estaba en su país. No pudo haber llegado aquí tan rápido. Siento un presencia detrás de mí. Giro para encontrarme a una chica desnuda de espaldas a mí en la cama. Aun dormida. Me pongo de pie de un salto. La miro detenidamente. Cuando ella gira hacia mí es cuando sé que estoy perdido. Mierda. Mil veces: MIERDA..! HOLAAAA..! xfin les dejo el capítulo que tanto les he venido anunciando- ahora si tienen una idea de que pasará.. así que por favor quiero leer sus reviews sobre que creen que pasara... pueden darme algunas ideas...! Desde mañana empezaré exámenes así que no estoy tan segura de poder actualizar. LES TENGO UN PROYECTO: necesito que me sugieran canciones románticas en todos los ritmos que puedan, salsa, merengue, cha cha cha, tango, música tradicional, baladas antiguas, disco... todos los ritmos.. ya me entenderán mas adelante para que es... ya tengo la idea pero quiero empezar a recolectar la música... se los agradecería muchisisisimo.! Como siempre espero sus reviews, no les toma ni un minuto :) gracias x todo.. nos leemos luego :) AVANCE: -Alex, mi amor perdóneme por favor, lo lamento mucho… - su voz tenía un tono de tristeza. -No te aflijas por no llamarme un día. Creo que puedo sobrevivir a eso. -Te amo. Lo sabes ¿verdad? – su voz expresaba desesperación lo que empezó a preocuparme. -Lo sé. Yo también te amo. Josh… ¿está todo bien? – él se demora en responder lo que me hace preocuparme aún más.[Chapter 42] Capítulo 42 -¿Qué medicamento prescribo? – Fernanda me pregunta mientras trabajamos en nuestro turno de externado en el hospital. -Amoxicilina más ácido clavulánico. Creo que viene en jarabe de 250 mg en 5 mililitros en frasco de 60 mililitros. También dale paracetamol, 5 ml cada 8 horas por tres días para la fiebre – nos encontrábamos medicando a un niño de 5 años con amigdalitis. Desde que estamos en tercer año tenemos que cubrir ciertas horas en el hospital, donde hipotéticamente tratamos a los pacientes, antes de aprobar el tratamiento uno de nuestros tutores confirma si lo hicimos bien. En verdad es un trabajo cansado pero te deja muchas recompensas, te hace querer seguir estudiando aunque sabes lo duro que es. -No sé cómo puedes aprenderte todas las dosis y presentaciones –me dice Fernanda mientras nos acomodamos en los asientos junto al escritorio. El reloj indica 3am. – Odio Farmacología. -Eso es gracias a Josh. -¿Qué tiene que ver Josh en que te sepas las dosis de medicamento? -A veces pasamos horas en videollamadas y ya no tenemos de que hablar así que él se pone a tomarme la lección de medicamentos. Ahora lo hacemos todas las noches y aunque no lo creas él se sabe mejor que yo, tiene una excelente memoria. -Me imagino que es por memorizar sus líneas. ¿Y has hablando con él desde noche vieja? -No, no hemos coincidido en el chat ni nada. Pero apenas han pasado 2 días, pronto se reportará. -Por suerte no eres de esas chicas que se obsesionan por saber cada paso que da su novio. -Lo que Josh y yo tenemos funciona porque nos tenemos confianza. Yo le puedo decir cualquier cosa y él igual. -Bueno pues te envidio hermana. Tu novio es un chico fantástico además de que tiene un trasero fabuloso. -No dijiste eso ¿verdad? – su sonrisa satisfecha me provoca querer golpearla y echarme a reír – no le viste el trasero de mi novio, Fernanda. -Que te puedo decir. Soy una chica y tengo ojos. Y ese trasero definitivamente debía ser analizado. -Ese trasero es mío, y te agradecería que no fantasees con él. -Eso es imposible. – la miro ceñuda y ella se hecha a reír. Yo también lo hago luego de darme cuenta lo estúpida que soy sintiendo celos por tonterías. Mi celular suena interrumpiendo nuestra risa. Lo reviso encontrándome con la mara de mi novio en la pantalla – Bueno ya era hora que Romeo llamara. -¿Cómo sabes que es él? -Es fácil. Tus ojos se iluminan cada vez que piensas o pasa algo que se refiere a él. Anda contéstale yo voy al baño – sonreí ante su afirmación y atendí la llamada. -Hola pequeño, extrañaba oír tu voz – mi emoción era palpable. -Alex, mi amor perdóneme por favor, lo lamento mucho… - su voz tenía un tono de tristeza. -No te aflijas por no llamarme un día. Creo que puedo sobrevivir a eso. -Te amo. Lo sabes ¿verdad? – su voz expresaba desesperación lo que empezó a preocuparme. -Lo sé. Yo también te amo. Josh… ¿está todo bien? – él se demora en responder lo que me hace preocuparme aún más. -Sí – su aliento se escapa de alivio – todo está bien. Solo necesitaba oír que me amas, que todo está bien. Lo necesitaba tanto… -Yo también te extraño – no se en que momento toda esta conversación se convirtió en esta charla sumamente extraña. -Siento que me ahogo cuando estoy lejos de ti, Alex. Soy obsesivo, celoso pero te amo. Te amo con todo mi corazón. Nunca lo olvides. Eres la única persona con quien quiero compartir mi vida, la única persona con quien quiero un para siempre… -¿Estás seguro de que todo está bien? – no puedo evitar tener un mal presentimiento. Pero no estoy dispuesta a dejarme llevar por ese sentimiento. Si él dice que todo está bien pues confiaré en él. -Mientras tú me ames todo estará bien – nos quedamos en silencio por un momento. Solo escuchaba su respiración al otro lado de la línea.- ¿Cómo va el turno? -Bien, está muy tranquilo. Y ¿Cómo está tu trabajo? -Bien. Tengo que prepararme para las regrabaciones de Sinsajo, pero todo está muy bien. Estoy tratando de que Steven me despeje todo para febrero, no dejo de extrañarte. -Ya quiero que estés aquí. – hablamos un rato más sobre cosas al azar. Cuando todo fue más fluido me relaje. Sabía que todo estaba bien por lo menos ahora. Él solo quiso hacerme saber que me amaba no había nada escondido en ello. Mis semanas fueron muy pesadas, con deberes, prácticas y exámenes. Con Josh casi no hemos podido hablar. Nuestras conversaciones se han reducido a un simple \"Hola\" \"¿Qué tal tu día?\" \"Hablamos luego\" \"Te amo\". Terminé mis exámenes, y aunque debería festejar no es así. Mi día fue de mal en peor. Desperté con un dolor de cabeza y mareo muy fuertes. Perdí toda mi mañana en trámites que me pidió mi mamá. Cuando me dirigía al hospital y una lluvia torrencial me atacó y llegué empapada. Fui a mi turno y un pequeño paciente con quien me había encariñado falleció. Algo en mi corazón se removió. Su nombre era Daniel y tenía 6 años. Sufría leucemia, recibía quimioterapias pero no fue suficiente para salvarlo y... no estuve aquí para despedirme. Era mi pequeño noviecito. Todos los días tenía una nueva broma para mí, era un pequeño diablillo. Su muerte me trajo tantos recuerdos. Todas esas veces que sentí que mi vida era frágil y le rogué a Dios que me diera la oportunidad de vivir, si lo hacía nunca dejaría de luchar nunca dejaría que nadie me derrumbe. Esa noche cuando Josh hablo conmigo y me preguntó le conté todo lo malo de mi día. Cuando le hablé de Daniel, él no comprendió del todo. Odie su comentario: \"Ves morir gente a diario, no digo que sea bueno pero no debería afectarte tanto\". Nadie nunca entendería lo identificada que me sentía con ese niño. Era como revivir una y otra vez esa tortura de morir lentamente. Decidí terminar con la conversación porque es un tema que no quiero tocar ni terminar provocando una pelea. Cuando desperté hoy, Josh había publicado para mí una canción (Bad Day – Daniel Powter: www_youtube_com/watch?v=3u90rd8vnyQ ) . Aunque era motivo de polémica en Facebook y twitter me saco una sonrisa al recordar que lo tengo a él y que trata de comprenderme a pesar de todo. -Hola pequeña, otra vez vine por ti. Santy estaba dormido, por lo tanto yo te llevaré, el vendrá con Fernanda más tarde – Darío estaba recostado contra su auto, esperándome. Normalmente siempre viajamos juntos a la universidad no importa el horario. Si tenemos una hora libre antes de clases, aprovechamos para estudiar en la biblioteca. Mi turno hoy empezaba a las 7 y el de ellos a las 8 de la mañana, todo porque me tocaba presentar un caso clínico. -Perdóname por ponerte en esos apuros – digo subiéndome en su auto – no sé cómo ellos pueden ponerse de acuerdo cuando están solos, pero si estuviera yo ya se habrían sacado los ojos. -Ya sabes que para mí es un placer pasar tiempo contigo y… creo que cuando están solos se olvidan sus diferencias y solo actúan sus hormonas – cuando lo mire interrogante, se dio cuenta que no sabía de lo que estaba hablando – No debí decir eso. -Dime lo que sabes – lo amenacé – o te torturaré hasta que confieses. -No debería ser yo quien te diga eso pero… - tomo aire antes de dar su discurso que sabía que no me gustaría – El otro día llegue a mi casa y sorprendí a Fernanda y mi hermano besándose en la sala, cuando notaron mi presencia se separaron. Cuando pregunte que pasaba dijeron que él tenía algo en su ojo y ella se lo estaba quitando. Fingí creerles para no entrar en conflicto. Sabes no me agrada nada. Mi hermano tiene novia y aunque no me agrade del todo no está bien que juegue con ella. - Lo sé, no sé qué hacer. No puedo meterme en sus vidas y si ninguno de ellos me tiene confianza como para contarme no puedo hablar. -Ellos te tiene confianza, pero hay cosas que uno no las habla – lo miro, su expresión de dolor me intriga – como cuando tu volviste y no nos hablaste de Josh… nos tenías confianza pero hubieron cosas que te hicieron no contárnoslo. -Ok, entendí el punto – una punzada de culpa me atravesó. -¿Cómo te fue ayer? – no sé por qué pero le conté todo mi día. Él siempre ha sido de esos chicos que me hacen hablar como loca sin parar. Cuando llegue a la parte de Daniel, pude notar que su rostro se tornó dulce. -… y siento como si todo es una mentira y él está bien. Se salvó, se curó. Nada malo le pasó. -Es mi idea o te sientes identificada con él? – Su intuición certera me intriga, él es de esas personas que me conocen bien - Estás de cierta forma reviviendo el pasado, es por eso que te duele. Mira Alex… Tú has pasado por mucho, has vivido cosas que nadie debe vivir, pero eso te hizo fuerte, te hizo la gran persona que eres. Tú eres de las pocas personas que salió adelante. No te culpes. Sé que estás pensando, puedo ver tus engranajes funcionando, estas cuestionándote cada punto de tu vida, sintiéndote culpable de estar viva y que ese pequeño no. -Yo no… -Sí, lo haces. Escúchame bien. Dios sabe porque hace las cosas. La muerte, las enfermedades, las cosas que se atraviesan en tu camino aparecen por una razón. Nadie tiene la vida comprada, vinimos al mundo por una razón y hasta que no cumplamos nuestra misión, seguiremos aquí. Reflexione por sus palabras. Tal vez tiene razón, me siento mal porque ese pequeño haya fallecido, tenía una vida larga por delante y todo se esfumo tan rápido. Él se fue y yo sigo aquí. Son cosas de la vida que aunque parezcan injustas, suceden. – Gracias, en verdad te debo mucho. -No tienes de que agradecerme. Amo cuando soy el único que te comprende, me hace sentir especial – la conversación se tornó incómoda. Cuando quise cambiar de tema, mi celular vibro, mostrándome la foto de mi novio en la pantalla. - Hola mi amor. -Hola Josh – de reojo vi a Darío sujetar el volante tan fuerte que sus nudillos se pusieron blancos. -¿A que no adivinas que hago? -No, dímelo. -Bueno, acabo de terminar de vestirme para la filmar el programa de San Valentín de Late Show with David Letterman. -¿En serio? – Amo ese programa – Waooooo y ¿qué hiciste? ¿De qué se trató? ¿Cómo fue? -No diré nada. Tendrás que verlo por ti misma pequeña. No hay discusión con ello. -Como te odio. -No lo haces. Me amas con todo tu corazón y no puedes vivir sin mí. -Que ego tan grande tienes. -Es la verdad – miré nuevamente a Darío que tenía su ceño fruncido. -Josh, hablamos luego ¿sí? Te quiero. -Alex, yo… - y corte la llamada. -No era necesario que hagas eso – su tono de voz definitivamente tiene un toque lastimero. -Si le daba rienda suelta a Josh hablaríamos por horas – mi celular vibro nuevamente, pero desvíe la llamada. Luego arreglaría las cosas con Josh – Ahora estoy hablando contigo. -No es algo que prefieras muy seguido. -Tú siempre me entiendes. Eres él único que entendió verdaderamente como me sentía. La cosa no es a quien prefiero o no. Lo que tú y yo tenemos es diferente a lo mío con Josh pero es igual de importante – las conexiones con las personas siempre son diferentes pero eso no le resta importancia al cariño, amistad y el amor. Nos quedamos en silencio hasta llegar al estacionamiento del campus. Luego de estacionar, él gira hacia mí y extendió una mano para acariciar mi mejilla. -A veces se hace muy difícil no sentir celos – sus dedos rozan la línea de mi mentón – Gracias, gracias por no alejarte de mí. Nos miramos por un instante. Él se acercó a mí. Iba a besarme, no podía permitir eso. Tire de mi cuerpo hacia atrás, él comprendió mi señal y no intentó nada mal. -¿Tu hermano ya preparó las maletas? – cambie de tema para evitar la incomodidad. -Sí, las hizo anoche. Estaba emocionado porque su extensión sea en la playa. -No es en la playa. La comunidad está cerca, pero no en la orilla – recordé mi plan frustrado con Josh. Él no podrá venir estas vacaciones. Había planeado encontrarnos el último día de la extensión, nuevamente y luego pasar dos días en la playa. Aprovechábamos la oportunidad porque mis papás no sabrían, ellos nunca me dejarían hacer un viaje a solas con mi novio por obvias razones. Pero en este caso diría que el viaje duro un par de días más, algo que ha pasado antes. Pero se presentó algo y Josh no vendrá. Me dolió mucho. Me duele, pero no puedo hacer nada por eso. -Bueno, pero igual pueden pegarse una escapadita ¿no? -Espero que sí – nos despedimos y asistí a mi último turno de este año. Mis maletas estaban listas. En un par de días viajaríamos a la comunidad donde cumpliríamos con nuestro servicio comunitario. Josh no ha mencionado nada acerca del hecho que le corte la llamada, porque estaba con Darío. Supongo que imagina lo que pasó y trata de no abordar el tema. Seguramente terminaríamos en pelea. Cuando hablamos ayer me hizo prometerle ver el programa de San Valentín de Late Show with David Letterman. No era necesario que me lo pida. Siempre lo veo. Me acomode en mi sillón con cientos de palomitas de maíz y soda que Fernanda trajo. Ella se está asegurando de que lo vea. Una misión a la que Josh le envió. El show empezó. Y mi corazón salto de emoción cuando David presentó a los asistentes y mi novio apareció. Ese chico volvía locas a todas con su carisma. Pero lo que más me emociono fue cuando la entrevista empezó. Holaaa...! se que es un capítulo no muy emocionante después del anterior, pero no tengo mucha creatividad en exámenes. pero me pareció importante hacerlo para recalcar ciertas cosas: 1) Josh y su actitud después lo que le paso, sabemos que Alex ha sido sincera con cosas que han pasado como el beso de Darío, pero lo de Josh es mas grave. sera capaz de decirle la verdad? 2) A veces cuando estas entre un dilema las personas que menos esperas te entienden de mejor forma , no siempre las personas que esperas y eso es importante porque Darío no es malo, es el chico perfecto para Alex, la ama, la entiende y comprende, pero no siempre la prefección es lo que queremos verdad? Espero que me tengan paciencia :P y agradezco y pido que me sigan mandando música, necesito canciones en todo tipo de ritmos, canciones romanticas, en salsa, tango, chachacha cualquier ritmo que se les ase por lamente asi sea de esas canciones que su mamá escuchaba , miesntras la letra tenga un lindo significado :P Gracias x sus reviews y mns y pido que los sigan dejando con sus comentarios, recomendaciones, ideas y con lo creen que pasará. no les toma ni un minuto y eso me motiva a inspirarme y escribir más rápido :) Nos leemos luego :P AVANCE: -Bueno, creo que las mujeres tienen alguna técnica para siempre hacernos sentir culpables. -No es cierto – replica Jennifer – Lo que sucede es que los hombres se limitan a pensar con su \"pequeño cerebro\" de ahí abajo. Para ellos es sí o no, nunca tal vez. Por suerte las mujeres si usamos nuestra cabeza y estamos abiertas a más posibilidades, además tenemos nuestro don de hacerles entrar en razón – aplausos del público y risas no se hacen esperar. -Mejor no opino sobre ello – brome David – entonces Josh, todos queremos saber cómo fue tu encuentro con el amor y cuando supiste que esa chica era para ti. - Milet 3[Chapter 43] Capítulo 43 Bienvenidos a este especial de San Valentín – David presentan el programa. Estamos vario invitados, entre ellos mis amigos Avan y Jenn. Luego de varias bromas, empieza la ronda de preguntas acerca de amor, relaciones, citas y SEXO. -Así que Josh – Me llama David- actualmente eres conocido por ser parte de una relación muy llamativa. Las chicas están locas por la dulzura que demuestras a tu novia. A pesar de todas las barreras que se les atraviesan siguen juntos y creo yo, mas enamorados que nunca. Quisiera que nos contaras como inició tu relación de \"Cuento de Hadas\" como todos la llaman. -Para empezar, es verdad que cada día amo más a esa chica, aunque lo de \"Cuento de Hadas\" muy difícilmente otorgaría a nuestra relación. Lo nuestro es de lo más normal. Nos queremos, apoyamos, extrañamos y también peleamos. -Por suerte siempre ha habido reconciliación – dice David. -Gracias al cielo que sí – mi tono desesperado y aliviado le saca una risa a la audiencia- Aunque debo adjudicarme que la mayor parte del tiempo siempre es mi culpa. -Bueno, creo que las mujeres tienen alguna técnica para siempre hacernos sentir culpables. -No es cierto – replica Jennifer – Lo que sucede es que los hombres se limitan a pensar con su \"pequeño cerebro\" de ahí abajo. Para ellos es sí o no, nunca tal vez. Por suerte las mujeres si usamos nuestra cabeza y estamos abiertas a más posibilidades, además tenemos nuestro don de hacerles entrar en razón – aplausos del público y risas no se hacen esperar. -Mejor no opino sobre ello – brome David – entonces Josh, todos queremos saber cómo fue tu encuentro con el amor y cuando supiste que esa chica era para ti. -Bueno David, la historia es muy interesante – sonrío recordando la forma en que conocí a la niña de mis ojos- La conocí en Denver cuando estuve allí para entrenarme y hacer un comercial. -Eso desmiente nuestras teorías. Todos especulábamos que se habían conocido en alguna de tus vacaciones en su país. Mejor cuéntanos que hacía ella en Denver. -Alex estuvo allí para estudiar. Vino a un curso para perfeccionar su dialecto en inglés. -Sabemos que estudia para médico, espero que me permitas acudir a consulta con ella alguna vez – sonríe – cada vez nos intrigas más. Mejor sácanos de la duda y dinos como se conocieron porque al parecer es una historia entretenida. -Como te dije yo vine porque acepte hacer un comercial donde tenía que bailar salsa – todo me miran con intriga – Soy un pésimo bailarín, mejor dicho era pésimo en ese ritmo; así que pedí que mi pareja no sea una bailarina profesional para que ambos nos moldeemos juntos y no sentirme ignorante en el tema. -Josh no quiso lastimar su ego. Los hombres piensan con su cerebrito – Se burla Jenn. -Así que los productores habían conocido a mi novia en una discoteca, la vieron bailar y le propusieron el trabajo. Por suerte para mí, ella acepto. -Entonces aprendieron juntos y se enamoraron como en esa película. Mmmm – David reflexiona por unos segundo – Step up. -Ojalá hubiera sido así – les aseguro – No solo mi ego quedo seriamente lastimado cuando esta chica me humillo bailando. En serio parecía profesional. Además logre que me odiara el mismo día. -Seguramente le contaste uno de tus chiste maslo – Avan bromea sacando risas a todos- con eso cualquiera te odiaría. -Cuéntanos Josh ¿Qué hiciste? – pregunta David. - El primer día de práctica para el comercial llegue tarde. Subí las escaleras del edificio corriendo y choque con alguien, pero no di importancia al incidente. Cuando me presentaron a Alex, me encontré que era la persona con quien choque y resulta que ella había recibido la peor parte del choque con un buen golpe en la cabeza por mi culpa. Ella me odiaba por eso. - Jajajaj. ¿Y qué fue lo que te dijo cuándo te reconoció como su atacante? -La primera palabra que la escuche decir refiriéndose a mí fue…. ESTÚPIDO. Luego trate todo el día de bromear con ella. Le coqueteé. Puse todo mi encanto y ella tenía uno de esos rostros donde parece que fuera a vomitar en cualquier instante. -Definitivamente causas ese efecto en todas las chicas – se burla Jenn y el público se echa a reír más fuerte. -Me costó mucho hacer que me perdonara y que me dirija la palabra. -¿Y cuándo te diste cuenta que querías a esa chica? -Ese mismo día, fue amor a primera vista – aún recuerdo el impactó que causo en mí – trataba de coquetear con ella. Creo que llegué a cansarla con mis intentos que ella me espetó algo en español esperando que no supiera de qué hablaba. Sus palabras fueron lo más dulce que ha llegado a mis oídos, y ahí supe que estaba perdido. -¿Y qué fue lo que dijo? – David se inclina curioso hacia mí. - ESTÚPIDO, EGOCÉNTRICO, ENGREÍDO.. Como dije, Con ello me conquistó. Las risas no pararon por un buen rato. Y los recuerdos me hacían sonreír aún más – Eso sí que es una forma de enamorarse. Cambiando de tema. Ya nos dijiste que por lo general tu eres el culpable de sus riñas ¿En qué crees que fallas? -La cosa es que me he convertido en un chico celoso. No puedo soportar a otro chico cerca de ella. Me vuelvo primitivo. Luego de mi típica demostración de territorio, ella explota y es cuando se desata la guerra. -¿Qué dice ella sobre eso? - Bueno, una vez la bese frente a su ex y cuando estuvimos solos ella dijo algo como: \"Solo te falta marcarme como de tu territorio, obviemos la parte de los líquidos de tu vejiga, por favor\" – lo último lo dije con una voz aguda de mujer tratando de imitarla. Reímos un poco más con las ocurrencias de Jenn. Avan y los otros invitados también contaron sus anécdotas. Trate de evitar el tema del sexo, no solo por el hecho de que al parecer era él único en abstinencia, no me agradaba la idea de que la vida íntima de mi novia este en boca de todos, eso era algo solo de nosotros, no complicaría más las cosas de lo que ya lo he hecho. -Me han hecho reír esta noche con sus ocurrencias. Nos acercamos al final del programa, pero antes, nuestro querido Josh ha preparado algo especial para su novia y para todos – esa es mi señal. Espero que mi novia vea este programa. Steven dijo que sería un poco de buena publicidad y la verdad mi corazón quiere gritarle al mundo que la amo y ella a mí. Me pongo de pie y me ubico en el asiento que me preparan. Tomo mi guitarra y las luces se apagan, luego una me ilumina. -Quiero dedicar esta canción a la chica más hermosa de este mundo. A esa niña que se metido en mi piel y se ha adueñado de mi corazón. Te amo Alexandra, más que nada. Lo único que quiero que sepas es que… soy tuyo… (I'm yours – Jason Mraz: www_youtube_com/watch?v=sdUc_aDQ6aw ) Pronuncié cada palabra con todo mi corazón en ello. Muchos aplausos y Awss se escucharon pero yo solo deseaba que ella lo escuchara. Necesitaba que ella supiera que la amo, que soy suyo. Sé que lo hice fue estúpido. No sé cómo paso, en que momento estuve tan borracho que perdí la cabeza. Mi corazón, mi mente y mi cuerpo creyeron entregarse a mi novia esa noche. Pero el destino me jugo una mala pasada. Me maldigo mil veces por haber ido. Me maldigo mil veces por haberme acostado con Shannon. Me maldigo mil veces por no ser lo suficientemente sincero para decirle lo que sucedió. Cuando desperté al día siguiente y me di cuenta de lo que sucedió mi mundo se derrumbó. Sabía que la perdería. Ella nunca podría perdonarme por esto. Por más excusas que pusiera, por más cosas que le dijera, la perdería. Ella me dejaría. Soy un cobarde, pero simplemente no puedo. No puedo perderla. Soy egoísta, soy un vil mentiroso pero no sé qué más hacer. Cuando desperté a Shannon ella me dijo que yo fui tras ella y la lleve a esa habitación. No recuerdo nada de esa noche. Lo único que pude hacer fue llamar a Steven. El vino en nuestro encuentro y llevo a Shannon al médico. La obligo a tomarse la \"píldora de emergencia\" para evitar un posible embarazo. Él cree que ella lo planeo pero no hubo manera de comprobarlo. Por lo menos no tengo que preocuparme por un hijo que no deseo. Sé que sueno ruin, pero soy un egoísta. Solo quiero a mi novia como la madre de mis hijos. Ahora solo me aferraba a que mi error no me quite lo que más amo en esta vida. Steven está tratando de encontrar alguna forma legal para que Shannon no abra su boca. El me apoyo en el hecho de que no quiero arriesgar mi relación, todo lo contrario a mi mamá. Fue la única a quien le conté lo que pasó. Ahora está muy decepcionada. No por el hecho de que engañara a mi novia, ella también piensa que todo fue planeado. Le decepcionó mi posición de no ser sincero con Alex. Pero maldita sea si no me entiende que no quiero arriesgarme a perderla. Me muero, literalmente si la pierdo. La culpa me persigue. Cuando la llame fue un momento de debilidad. Tenía miedo de que ella ya supiera, tenía miedo de haberla perdido. Me di cuenta de que presintió algo, pero lo dejo pasar gracias a Dios. Ahora solo podía esperar que Steven salvara mi pellejo y todo pasaría. La culpa me oprimiría al inicio pero pasaría… nada comparado al dolor que me destrozaría si ella me dejara. La canción termina y David despide el programa. Me despido de todos y me escapo al baño, necesito hablar con mi novia. - Hola mi amor – amaba como sonaban esas palabras en mis labios. -Hola Josh – su tono fue dulce, pero tenía un tenue tinte de inseguridad. -¿A que no adivinas que hago? -No, dímelo. -Bueno, acabo de terminar de vestirme para la filmar el programa de San Valentín de Late Show with David Letterman. -¿En serio? Waooooo y ¿qué hiciste? ¿De qué se trató? ¿Cómo fue? -No diré nada. Tendrás que verlo por ti misma pequeña. No hay discusión con ello. – ella tenía que verlo, tenía que escuchar las cosas que die. Ella necesitaba saber lo importante que era para mí. -Como te odio. -No lo haces. Me amas con todo tu corazón y no puedes vivir sin mí. – al igual que yo. -Que ego tan grande tienes. -Es la verdad – si lo tengo. Me siento como el hombre más afortunando del mundo gracias a ella. -Josh, hablamos luego ¿sí? Te quiero.- no me gusto la forma en que lo dijo. No fue un \"te amo\" todo se redujo a un \"te quiero\". Era como si quisiera deshacerse de mí. -Alex, yo… - cortó la llamada. Volví a marcar su número y me mando a buzón. Debía estar en algo. No quiero ponerme en plan celoso e inseguro, no tengo ningún derecho a hacerlo después de lo que hice. Así que solo lo dejo pasar. Mientras esperaba abordar el avión que llevaría a ella, mi celular vibró y su rostro apareció en mi pantalla. Moría por contestarle, pero sabía que no podría guardar silencio y quiero darle la sorpresa. Fernanda me ayudo a planearlo. Le dije a mi novia que no podría ir. Así que será una sorpresa cuando llegue a la velada de despedida de su extensión. Luego de ello pasaremos 2 días en la playa. Y la noche de San Valentín tengo preparado una sorpresa. Solo espero superar esto. El no ser sincero con ella me mata lentamente, pero hay cosas que no se pueden evitar. Hooooola a todos :) estoy muy emocionada porq solo faltan 9 días para ver CF. Aki les dejo este nuevo capítulo, ya saben la calma antes de la tormenta (o es al revés) Hoy terminé un capítulo (47) q me tomo varios días no tenia idea de como escribirlo, uds me entenderán cuando lo lean. tratare de escribir algunos capítulos estos días para tener de reserva cuando este atareada y no hacerles esperar mucho..pienso ser mas constante en actualizar.. estoy pensando en los miércoles y sábados o domingos. 2 caps x semana. los próximos serán mas largos. la verdad tengo una idea de cmo avanzar la historia aunque aun no se que tan larga será, creo q eso vendrá conforme avance.

Un brazo se envuelve en mi cintura y otro por encima de mi pecho, mi única reacción es patear lo que nos hace perder el equilibrio a ambos y caemos de bruces en el agua. No sé como pero tome aire mientras caía. Me zafo de esos brazos y trato de avanzar hacia la orilla. Por suerte no es muy profundo y doy pie rápidamente cuando me vuelven a tomar y me giran. Siento unos labios sobre los míos y tengo la experiencia más rara de mi vida. Mi mente dice que grite, que me aleje pero mi cuerpo y mi corazón me hacen quedarme. Respondo a ese beso.[Chapter 44] Capítulo 44 -Maldición – grito desesperada – estos mosquitos me van a comer viva. -Te dije que usaras repelente – Diego me contesta divertido. Saca algo de su mochila – Debería dejar que sufrieras por cabezota, pero soy demasiado bueno para verte sufrir. Ahí va – me lanza su repelente. -Discúlpame por odiar oler a esa cosa – le devuelvo su botellita – es asquerosa. -Pero si sales vestida de esa manera – hace una seña señalando mi atuendo – debes buscar una manera de protegerte. Miro la forma en que estoy vestida. Un short jean, una blusa azul de tiras y mi cabello metido dentro de una gorra. Mis botas de caucho que me dieron en la comunidad aunque no son lindas son prácticas cuando andamos por el barro como ahora. Estamos caminando hacia una pequeña comunidad para administrar vacunas contra el paludismo al pequeño grupo que vive ahí. No se puede acceder en auto solo dos horas a pie. Diego y yo nos ofrecimos de voluntarios junto con el médico de la comunidad. La idea era escaparnos de recoger todo los instrumentos, camas, cocinas, todo lo que trajimos para la extensión. Prefiero mil veces esto que a ese horrible trabajo. -Si me ponía cualquier otra cosa encima iba a morir de insolación. -Yo pensé que querías obtener un bronceado – Diego siempre me saca una sonrisa. Caminamos por otro rato cuando divisamos la comunidad. Llegamos y nos ponemos manos a la obra. Vacunamos alrededor de 45 personas. Tardamos unas 5 horas y ya estábamos de camino nuevamente al campamento. Por suerte la noche había llegado y el calor había disminuido considerablemente. Lo único difícil era no tropezar con la maleza o alguna piedra en el camino. Diego iba detrás de mí. Caminos en silencio porque estábamos cansados por el día. Lo único que quería era llegar al campamento, pegarme un baño en el río y meterme en la cama. Mañana iríamos a un centro turístico y celebraríamos el final de otra extensión más. Y por la noche nuestro transporte vendrá para llevarnos nuevamente a casa. -Luz! Veo la luz – grita mi amigo dramático haciéndonos reír cuando las luces del campamente asoman entre la vegetación. -Nunca he conocido a nadie más dramático que tú. Deberías ser actor – le aseguro. -Tienes razón. Tú tienes una debilidad por actores. Quizás tenga mejor suerte si lo soy – su comentario fue como un balde de agua fría. El mira mi cambio de humor y cambia de tema para evitar la incomodidad. -Te ves horrible – me dice Fernanda en cuanto me ve. -Si quisiera alguien que me diga lo obvio fueras la primera a quien buscara – ella me da u guiño divertido, pero algo en su expresión me dice que está nerviosa. Es la forma de parpadear cada 4 segundos. La conozco como la palma de mi mano – Vamos. Suelta la sopa. -¿De qué hablas? – me pregunta ahora parpadeando más seguido. En verdad está escondiendo algo. -Dímelo Fernanda. Escondes algo. No lo niegues. Te conozco como la palma de mi mano. -Vale. Si escondo algo pero no te diré ahora. Lo comprenderás luego. Ahora te sugiero que vayas por un baño. Apestas. - Definitivamente te encanta recalcar lo obvio. Ahora voy. Me acompañas? – el sitio donde tomamos nuestro baño está a 5 minutos a pie. El río en ese lugar se amplía formando una especie de lago no correntoso donde podemos nadar y es perfecto para bañarnos. Pero no me agrada la idea de ir sola de noche a ese sito. - No puedo, soy la encargada de preparar los bocadillos para más noche – le frunzo el ceño para tratar de convencerla – tranquila no te pasará nada. Te aseguro que disfrutaras. Yo me encargaré de que nadie más vaya. Así tienes todo el sitio para tú y tú…. Tus pensamientos. -Estas actuando demasiado raro. No entiendo ni mierda de lo que dices. Y como me siento desesperada por un baño indagare luego. Gracias por ser tan buena amiga y abandonarme sola. -Me amarás luego – me grita mientras me tomo el camino al rio llevando mi toalla, jabón, shampoo, y todo lo que necesito para volver a estar decente. Camine en medio de la maleza hasta llegar al claro donde podría bañarme, mientras avanzaba escuchaba a los animales a la distancia y el sonido de los grillos en el monte. Cuando llegue ahí me sorprendí al notar que no necesitaba encender la linterna que traje. La luna y las estrellas iluminaban todo. La luz blanca recaía sobre el agua y la vegetación. Un paisaje realmente hermoso. Tanta belleza me recordó a mi novio y una punzada de añoranza me ataco. Quisiera que estuviera aquí conmigo para poder disfrutar de esto. Lastimosamente no lo podré ver. Quería pasar San Valentín con él. El año pasado debido a nuestra pelea en Denver no nos vimos. Decido quitarme esos pensamientos de mi mente y ver el lado positivo. Algún día estaremos todo el tiempo juntos. Acomodo mi toalla y mis instrumentos de aseo cerca de la orilla para luego poder alcanzarlos, cuando escucho una rama crujir detrás de mí. Giro y busco con mi mirada algún intruso. -¿Alguien ahí? – pregunto varias veces y nadie me responde. Me estoy volviendo paranoica. Tal vez fue un animalito que pasaba por ahí. Empiezo a trepar por las piedras hasta llegar un poco alto para poder saltar. Prefiero entrar en el agua fría de un solo golpe antes de arrepentirme. Cuando subo un poco me detengo a admirar la vista un momento más. Es hermoso. Me preparo para saltar al río, lo hago con todo mi ropa puesta. Así aprovecho y se lava un poco. No sé porque me acobardo un poco. La idea de que la temperatura del agua este muy fría no me reconforta. Así que cierro los ojos y avanzo lentamente a tientas hacia el extremo de la roca, cuando siento que me sujetan desde atrás, tomándome por la cintura. Mi impulso es gritar pero de mi boca no sale más que un gemido. Un brazo se envuelve en mi cintura y otro por encima de mi pecho, mi única reacción es patear lo que nos hace perder el equilibrio a ambos y caemos de bruces en el agua. No sé como pero tome aire mientras caía. Me zafo de esos brazos y trato de avanzar hacia la orilla. Por suerte no es muy profundo y doy pie rápidamente cuando me vuelven a tomar y me giran. Siento unos labios sobre los míos y tengo la experiencia más rara de mi vida. Mi mente dice que grite, que me aleje pero mi cuerpo y mi corazón me hacen quedarme. Respondo a ese beso. Cuando mis sentidos se tranquilizan y vuelven a funcionar me doy cuenta porque todo es tan familiar. Josh está frente mí. Sosteniéndome entre sus brazos, besándome desesperado. La furia dentro de mí se empieza hacer presente por lo que simplemente actuó. Mi mano voló más rápido que mi pensamiento y se estampó en su mejilla. Mi mano ardió. Su mirada incrédula me hizo enfurecer aún más. – Eres un estúpido - grito exasperada- Nunca vuelvas a hacer eso otra vez. Maldita se Josh, casi me muero del susto. Su rostro se llenó de culpa cuando mis sollozos aparecían. Pensé que iba a ser mi fin, que iba a morir ahí mismo, en ese hermoso lugar. Josh se acercó y me abrazo. Llore contra su pecho mientras el rogaba por mi perdón. – No pensé que te asustarías tanto. Lo lamento mucho, por favor… no llores, me rompe el alma verte así- me atrajo hacia él aún más fuerte y estuvimos en esa posición por un momento más hasta que pude tranquilizarme y evaluar la situación con calma. Él solo quiso darme un sorpresa, pero…. Sentí que era mi fin. Tuve mucho miedo. -¿Qué haces aquí Josh? – rompí el silencio antes de que se vuelva incomodo – Me dijiste que no vendrías. -Quise darte una sorpresa – vaya que me sorprendió – perdóname por asustarte, no pensé que reaccionarías así… -Tranquilo, todo está bien – envuelvo mis brazos en su cuello y beso el punto bajo su oreja que le provoca cosquillas – me alegra que estés aquí. Soltó el aire que retenía en suspiro y me dio una sonrisa delicada, pero aun cautelosa – Tenía que festejar San Valentín contigo. No podía perderme otro año. Te tengo preparada una sorpresa. -¿otra? – beso su nariz juguetonamente. Disfruto cada momento, de su toque, del cálido contraste entre la temperatura del aire y del agua que nos rodea - ¿Qué sorpresa? -Mmmm tendrás que esperar hasta mañana pequeña curiosa – tomo mis muslo y los levanto, inmediatamente envolví mis piernas en su cintura – Ahora déjame besuquearte antes de que explote de necesidad. Nuestros labios se juntaron. Desesperados en un inicio, tratando de recuperar el tiempo perdido, pero luego llevaron un ritmo lento. Disfrutando cada roce, reconociéndose, encontrándose como si fuera agua para dos sedientes en el desierto. Nadamos, jugamos, hablamos, y por supuesto, nos besamos. Las siguientes horas fueron maravillosas. Existamos n un mundo que solo era nuestro, un paraíso donde solo importabamos nosotros. Eso es lo maravilloso del amor, donde nunca es suficiente y a la vez es todo lo que basta para ser feliz. Él es el único con quien siento eso. Lo amo. -Te amo princesa. Eres todo lo que necesito para ser feliz, todo lo que quiero... – sonrío con sus románticas declaraciones – eres todo para mí, Alex. -Tu eres todo mi mundo – le susurré en su oído – ahora es mejor que vayamos a cambiarnos. -¿No podemos quedarnos aquí? – su puchero siempre me arranca una risa. -Nooooooooooooouuuuuuuuu. Debemos cambiarnos, además a estas horas deambulan animales y no quiero encontrarme con una serpiente nadando con nosotros. Su rostro de terror apareció ante la mención sacándome carcajadas – No me digas que tienes miedo a las serpientes, Josh? -No te burles – respondió a la defensiva – solo no me gusta tenerlas cerca. Vámonos de aquí – me arrastró hacia la orilla lo más rápido que pudo. Recogió mis cosas y emprendimos nuestro viaje de regreso con los demás prácticamente al trote. No podía dejar de reír. Era inevitable – Basta Alex, no te burles de mí. Me haces sentir mal que yo tenga miedo a algo y tu no. -No debes sentirte mal por eso. Todos le tenemos miedo a algo. -Tú no. Hasta ahora no conozco algo que te de miedo. Yo siempre soy el debilucho de nosotros dos. -Así te quiero mi amor – me cuelgo de su cuello para besarlo, casi perdemos el equilibrio pero valió la pena – eres la persona más valiente. Sé que siempre estarás allí para protegerme. -Tienes razón. Siempre te protegería – mis cosas cayeron al suelo y nuevamente enganche mis piernas a su cintura – Nunca me has dicho a qué le tienes miedo. Sé a qué le tengo miedo. Lo que ocurrió hace un momento me lo demostró. Pero decido meditar para darle la respuesta adecuada, tiene mucho que ver con algo que aún no le he contado a Josh, pero sus besos en mi cuello no me dejan concentrarme – Siempre buscas la manera de hacerme perder la cabeza. -Yo solo soy el de los labios – sonríe contra a piel de mi clavícula. -Mmmm le tengo miedo a…, no sé cómo decirlo… mi temor es.. -Qué asco. Ustedes parecen dos adolescentes que intentan devorarse el uno al otro – Fernanda nos alcanza con Santiago a su lado – Aquí habemos gente sana. Traten de controlarse por favor. -Vamos Ferny, déjalos que sean felices. No seas envidiosa – Santiago la reprende pícaramente –Si quieres te puedo dar una probadita de lo que ellos están haciendo. -Ni en tus mejores sueños – con Josh no podemos retener la risa. Esos dos tienen peleas infantiles todo el tiempo. Avanzan el camino restante delante de nosotros aun discutiendo. -Chicos gracias por ayudarme con esto – les grita mi novio. -Todo sea por el amor – le respondió Santiago. -No seas patético Santiago – le regaño Fer – de nada Josh. -Debí suponer que todos ustedes estaban detrás de esto. No puedo creer que me ocultaran cosas y dicen ser mis amigos. -Lo siento amiga – Santy me sonreía – pero todos tenemos un precio y él alcanzo el nuestro. -¿Ah sí? – Mire a mi novio que sonreí divertido - ¿Qué fue lo que le ofreciste? -No sé si deba decirte – beso mi nariz. Yo hice un mohín sabiendo que lo haría hablar – les ofrecí irnos dos días a la playa con todo pagado junto con nosotros. Y antes de que digas algo ya están hechas las reservas y arreglado lo de tus papás. -¿mis papás? – la verdad es que me emociona la idea pero me preocupa tener problemas con ellos. -Los llame y casualmente les dije que la extensión tardaría un par de días más – dijo Fernanda. -¿Y no se preguntaron porque llamaste tú y no yo para informarles? – Josh me abrazo por detrás y empezó a besar mi cuello. -Deja de preocuparte amor. Solo di que SI y todos felices- sus labios devoraron los míos empezando a emocionarme la idea de él y yo solos. -No van a tener sexo frente a nosotros ¿verdad? – Fernanda hizo un sonido de vómito y nos separamos para reír por sus ocurrencias – Le dije que estabas en una comunidad donde no había señal, que saliste de emergencia y me pediste que los llamara. Además dijeron que no hay problema que se quedarían unos días para resolver unos problemas con las casas. Mi familia, mis papas, tíos y otros, tienen una empresa de construcción de casa y edificios por todo el país. Es por eso que viajan constantemente para controlar que todo vaya bien. Todos me miraban intrigantes. Santiago estaba tan emocionado que hacía unos de sus pucheros patéticos. Josh también hacia uno de esos. Tenían todo planeado, no podía quitarles la emoción, así que hice lo correcto. -Está bien iremos. Hola a todos... un nuevo capítulo... no quiera que esperaran mucho así que aquí lo tienen.. gracias por sus mns y reviews y les pido que los sigan dejando, no les toma ni un minuto y esa es mi motivación :) sigan enviando sus canciones.. ya saben de todo tipo de ritmo con letras que tengan un significado :) dejen sus comentarios de que creen que pasará mas adelante, quiere saber sus hipótesis :) Ando medio apurada, asi que me despido :) - Nos leemos luego - 3 Milet AVANCE: -No me quiero imaginar cómo sería si viviéramos juntos. -Seguramente no te dejara salir de la cama y no precisamente porque estuviéramos durmiendo. -¿Ah sí? – se incorpora acomodándose lo mejor posible sobre mí. Con su índice traza la línea de mi mandíbula y la desliza por mi cuello. Su mirada es seductora, y cuando muerde su labio inferior sé que estoy condenadamente perdido – y.. ¿Qué se supone que haríamos en una cama si no vamos a dormir?[Chapter 45] Capítulo 45 Desperté con una gran sonrisa en mi rostro y un gran dolor en mi espalda. Abrí los ojos cuando la luz se filtraba por mis párpados. En mis brazos estaba Alex. Luego de bailar toda la noche quedamos dormidos en una hamaca, ella sobre mí, aunque adoro la posición mi columna opina lo contrario. Los demás partieron de regreso maso menos a las tres de la mañana. Fernanda y Santiago desaparecieron. Pero nosotros nos dormimos aquí junto al río. Hoy tengo planeado una gran velada. Mañana será San Valentín y quiero hacer algo especial, algo que nunca olvide, que le haga amarme más. Todo eso ya está preparado, solo necesito un poco de ayuda de Fernanda para que todo esté completo. La escucho suspirar y una lenta sonrisa se pasma en su rostro. Seguramente su sueño es muy bueno, espero que yo esté en él. Como siempre, no puedo resistirme y mis inquietos labios empiezan a hacer su trabajo en todo su rostro. Ella empieza a reír aun con los ojos cerrados y a revolverse sobre mí. Ese contacto hizo que mi pequeño amigo empezara a saltar, la vergüenza me atravesó, no quería que ella pensara que solo tenía sexo en mi mente. -Nunca me dejas dormir, tienes algo contra mí - siguió sonriendo. Bese sus labios sus párpados aun cerrados, sus mejillas. -Lo siento, pero eres irresistible- le digo la verdad. -No me quiero imaginar cómo sería si viviéramos juntos. -Seguramente no te dejara salir de la cama y no precisamente porque estuviéramos durmiendo. -¿Ah sí? – se incorpora acomodándose lo mejor posible sobre mí. Con su índice traza la línea de mi mandíbula y la desliza por mi cuello. Su mirada es seductora, y cuando muerde su labio inferior sé que estoy condenadamente perdido – y.. ¿Qué se supone que haríamos en una cama si no vamos a dormir? Su juego me excita aún más. No sé cuánto tiempo más voy a soportar sin abalanzarme sobre ella y hacerla gemir de placer – Pues te dejaría completamente desnuda, te recorrería cada parte de tu cuerpo con mi boca, te haría gemir y alcanzar la gloria con mi nombre saliendo de tus labios. Y lo repetiría todo una y otra vez. -Ohhh – besa mi mandíbula, me sorprende que su sonrojo no haya llegado y amo que sus ojos reflejen deseo - ¿Qué tal si yo quiero jugar algo diferente? -Espero que no estés hablando algo relacionado con cincuenta sombras de grey, porque si quieres jugar de esa manera deberías avisarme para mandar a construir un cuarto rojo – la idea de disfrutar de esa manera el sexo en cierta forma me emociona, no el hecho de usar sado si no de saber que podemos jugar y probar cosas nuevas para nuestro disfrute. -No puedo creer que leíste cincuenta sombras – me da un suave golpe en el hombro – eres un pervertido Josh. -¿Y tú como sabes de que se trata? Es obvio que lo has leído, pequeña pervertida – ella se sonroja y me divierto de su vergüenza. Empiezo a hacerle cosquillas y ella explota en risas. Nos revolvimos en nuestro estrecho espacio, hasta que por alguna razón caí de bruces al piso y ella sobre mí. -Debo dejar de caer de esta manera – ella se sienta sobre mi amigo y no puedo evitar un gemido se me escape. Me mira divertida con su sexy ceja levantada. -SI lo he leído, es una linda historia de amor. -Si seguro que solo es por eso – la atraigo hacia mí para volver a besar y ella me lo pone fácil. La beso con pasión y necesidad. Ella se restriega sobre mí. Definitivamente está excitándome más y cuando un gemido escapo de su garganta confirme que ella también iba por mí mismo camino. -Oh por Dios – la voz de Fernanda nos interrumpe, nuevamente. Definitivamente ella siempre es inoportuna, pero simplemente no puedo enojarme con ella - ¿Tengo que lanzarles agua para separarlos como si fueran perros? -No gracias, quiero conservarme seca hasta llegar a la playa – mi novia se pone de pie y me ofrece su ayuda para hacer lo mismo. -Odio tener que interrumpir siempre su locura hormonal, pero el taxi ya está aquí. Santiago está subiendo las maletas. Fernanda empieza a regresar hacia la plaza. Mi novia la sigue pero yo tiro de su mano hacia mí para besarla nuevamente. Ella me besa y sonríe. - Te amo pequeña pícara. -Son incorregibles – grita Fernanda y avanza haciendo sonidos de asco. Viajamos por 2 horas hasta llegar al hotel que reserve. Busque este sitio porque tiene playa privada donde no habrá mucha gente que busque tener fotos o autógrafos. Es una medida de seguridad más para mi novia que para mí. No queremos que sus padres nos interrumpan. Además el dueño me ayudo a completar mi sorpresa para que la velada sea estupenda. Bajamos y rápidamente la recepcionista salió a nuestro encuentro. Me saludaron muy atentamente pues sabían quién soy. Subieron nuestro equipaje a la habitación que reserve. Era un minidepartamento, un recibidor y 2 habitaciones cada una con su baño. Las chicas tomaron uno y yo compartiría otra con Santy. Después de acomodar mi equipaje me dirigí a buscar a mi novia. Cuando iba en camino la puerta sonó. Abrí y recibí el almuerzo que pedimos. Rápidamente todos salieron de su habitación como si no hubieran comido en días. Nos acomodamos cada uno con su plato y charlamos. -Entonces… ¿Cuál es el plan para hoy? – mi novia pregunta. -Eso deberías preguntarle a tu novio, él te tiene preparado una sorpresa – dijo Fernanda. -¿Ah sí? ¿y qué haremos, Josh? -No sabrás hasta que llegue el momento. Por cierto es hora de que se vayan chicas, quiero que estén listas a tiempo. Por favor Fer tráela a tiempo. -Odio cuando hablan como si no estuviera aquí… y ¿A dónde se supone que vamos? -Pues tu novio me dio su tarjeta de crédito para una tarde de chicas. Tenemos que encontrar algo fabuloso para ti – Alex me mira con un poco de disgusto. Sé que no le agrada la idea de una tarde de chicas y mucho menos que yo pague todo. -No tienes que gastar tu dinero en mí – me dice mirando al piso. Me acerco a ella y hago que mire tomándola del mentón. -Me gusta gastar dinero en ti. Tú me das más de lo que el dinero puede comprar…me amas, jodido, estúpido, celoso, arrogante, famoso... me amas… así que considéralo un regalo para mí. Verte usar algo lindo es una de mis fantasías. -Eres el chico más cursi que conocí – se sienta en mi regazo a horcajadas y besa mi nariz. -Debes admitir que amas mi lado cursi - mis manos se aventuran debajo de su blusa, adoro la sensación de su piel bajo mi tacto. -Yo amo todo de ti – me da un pico. -¡Ya basta! – Grita Fernanda – no van a tener sexo en frente de nosotros. Vámonos Alex, sus demostraciones públicas de afecto me provocan nauseas. Tira del brazo de mi novia casi haciéndole que caiga, por suerte la agarre. La lleva prácticamente arrastrando a la puerta. Alex se sujeta del marco mientras Fernanda tira de ella. Corro hacia ella y la beso nuevamente mientras disfrutamos del disgusto de Fer y la risa de Santy. Cuando por fin se fueron me quedo con la sonrisa más tonta en mi rostro. Amo a esa chica, amo sus locuras, amo cada parte de ella, su personalidad, su esencia, su cuerpo. Oh sí!, amo su cuerpo. -En verdad son el uno el otro – Santy palmea mi hombro – Me alegra de que ella encontrara a alguien como tú, se nota que la amas. -Lo hago, la amo con todo mi corazón. -Bien, espero que sean felices, y quiero ser el padrino de uno de sus mellizos. -¿cómo sabes que tendremos mellizos? – la idea suena interesante, pero la forma en que asegura que tendremos 2 hijos de una me intriga. -Ohhhh, aún no lo sabes. Debes preguntarle a tu novia – su expresión de burla me intriga más. Definitivamente es algo que mi novia me tiene que decir. -¿Qué hay entre tú y Fer? – le pregunto, ahora que hay más confianza. La intriga me mata. -Solo somos amigos… muy buenos amigos – lo dice en un tono pícaro lo que me hace entender a qué tipo de amigos se está refiriendo – no me malinterpretes, ella es preciosa, cualquier hombre con dos ojos quisiera meterla en su cama. Pero ese carácter… Me vuelve loco, amo que me discuta todo, me provoca cerrar es boca con un beso, pero al mismo tiempo me da ganas de estrangularla. -¿Estás enamorado de ella? – no puedo evitar comparar sus sentimientos con los míos cuando conocí a Alex. Ella provocaba que quisiera besarla y al mismo tiempo ahorcarla por no ceder a mis encantos y llevarme la contraria en todo. -No – su respuesta fue contundente – sé que tuvimos nuestro pasado pero no estoy enamorado de ella. Solo es deseo, pasión y lujuria. Es difícil dejar esos hábitos con ella. Es tan buena en la cama. Cuando estamos juntos pareciera que vamos a incendiar todo a nuestro alrededor. -No necesitaba esa información sobre ella, pero creo que lo que están haciendo está mal. Ella te quiere, y le estás haciendo daño. -¿Qué ella me quiere? ¿Has visto como me trata? Como la peor peste que existe, no me soporta. -No te soporta pero no pueden quedarse solos porque dejan salir sus instintos y no lo niegues porque tenemos pruebas. -¿Alex lo sabe? – me pregunta preocupado, cuando asiento continua – Mierda, ella me debe odiar ¿no es así? -Le duele que su amiga sufra y que ustedes no tengan la confianza para contárselo pero no te odia. – le tranquilizo – se sincero conmigo Santy ¿en verdad no sientes nada por ella? Se queda pensando por una rato. Con sus codos en sus piernas y sus manos acunando su nariz. – Ella me dejó. Ella terminó con lo que teníamos, no fui yo. No le importó que yo la quisiera. Un día le dije que la amaba y al siguiente día ella terminó conmigo, así de simple me votó de su vida. No tiene derecho a reclamarme nada ni a hacerme sentir mal por lo que suceda. -¿Aun la quieres? – sentí tristeza por su estado. Yo sabía que si aún le duele es porque aun la ama. -Tengo a Liss, ella me quiere solo que no puedo evitar estar con Fernanda. Es mi talón de Aquiles, cada vez que la beso se me olvida que me rompió el corazón. Quisiera olvidarme de ella, de verla como una simple amiga – sus ojos se cerraron y me sentí mal por hacerlo recordar – Tenía planeado un futuro con ella. Quizás fui el primero de los chicos que soñaba con una vida con ella, muchos hijos, una casa, un perro. Fui tan iluso, pensé que ella me amaba pero me abandonó, no me quiso en esa época y mucho menos me quiere ahora, solo me usa porque sabe que somos buenos en la cama juntos, es todo lujuria. -Pero te sigue buscando, siguen encontrándose. -Si me busca porque aún no ha logrado convencerme de acostarme con ella. No lo hemos hecho desde que terminamos. Solo nos hemos besado y quizás un poco más, pero no me atrevía a tomarla porque tengo miedo de que se olvide de mí una vez que lo consiga y sé que si la tengo de esa manera me derrumbaré. Ya no quiero ser el chico patético que ella abandona. -¿Y si ella te dijera que te ama? -No me ama – me contesta frustrado. -¿Y si si? Hipotéticamente si supieras que ella te ama ¿lucharías por ella? -No lo sé y no quiero pensar en eso, no quiero ilusiones ni falsas expectativas. Me ha costado mucho estar bien, ahora tengo novia y aunque la traicione tengo la esperanza de que algún día la amaré. -Gracias por contármelo, significa mucho que confíes en mí de esa manera. Debes saber que las cosas pasan por algo. -Suenas a Alex, ella siempre dice eso. – se pone de pie y con un movimiento tonto nos damos un abrazo de apoyo – Dejémonos de niñerías y vamos a arreglar todo para tu cita. Chocamos nuestros puños y me acompaño a la cabaña que conseguí para arreglar todo para esta noche. Sería perfecto, sería la cita perfecta con la que cada chica sueña, un recuerdo que nunca olvidaría. Ya le he dicho que la amo, ahora necesito hacerle saber que haría todo lo necesario para que sea feliz. Le regalaría las estrellas, le regalaría el mundo si me lo pidiera. Aun mi conciencia me culpa por ocultarle lo de Shannon, pero soy tan egoísta que no quiero arriesgarme a que ella no me perdone. Hola a todos... aki les dejo un nuevo capítulo.. pensaba subir 2 pero no hubo reviews del anterior :/ asi que prefiero guardarlos para cuando los estén leyendo..! Estoy tan emocionada x CF.. aun no salgo del estado MENTALMENTE DESORIENTADA x a película... asi que hoy no les daré mi opinión..! Como siempre les agradezco por leerlos y espero sus comentarios con sugerencias, música, y espero en verdad sus ideas o suposiciones de que va a suceder..! la verdad es que tengo la idea pero no el tiempo par desarrollarla.. no sabria decirles cuantos capítulos faltan pero esperamos que sean muchos :) nos leemos luego - 3 Milet AVANCE: -Sí, sí creo, ahora dame ese vestido porque nos lo llevamos. Hoy te vestirás, te maquillaras y quedaras súper sexy, saldrás con tu sexy novio y disfrutaran la velada, se besuquearan, hablaran, se volverán a besuquear y espero que tengan sexo. Empiezo a reír, esta chica siempre consigue matarme de la risa –Tú siempre piensas en sexo. -¿y tú no?[Chapter 46] Capítulo 46 -Ustedes son imposibles, sé que están enamorados y toda esa locura pero si no tienen sexo rápido van a explotar y lo van a hacer el rato menos pensado y quizás sea en público. Río de los comentarios de Fernanda mientras me pruebo el vestido. Cuando salgo para mostrárselo ella da un silbido. -Creo que encontraste el adecuado – me acerco al espejo y giro ante él. Este vestido me hace sentir sexy. Es de color rojo. Un corpiño abraza mi busto donde la tela se extiende como pliegues delgados en varias direcciones y nos pequeños apliques le dan el brillo necesario para lucir elegante pero no muy llamativo. Por debajo del busto caen varias capas de tela que terminan en puntas en diferentes direcciones terminando cada una de ella sobre mi rodilla. Es simplemente mi estilo. Ajustado en el busto, con un escote delicado y holgado en la falda - ¿crees que le guste? – pregunto nerviosa, no sé porque pero la idea de esta noche me pone nerviosa, como si fuera una primera cita. -Le encantará, te lo seguro. Él te amaría aunque uses un costal de papas, así que relájate. Me miro otra vez en el espejo y ahora si estoy segura de que lo amará. Regreso al vestidor y me lo quito. Miro la etiqueta el precio y es cuando un balde de agua fría me cae. -No voy a comprar esto, es demasiado caro. -Uhh, recuerdas – dice levantando la tarjeta de Josh – novio con dinero, tarjeta de crédito a nuestra disposición. -No me siento cómoda gastando tanto dinero en mí. -Antes de que des tu discursito creo que ya deberías saber que a Josh no le interesa, él no piensa que seas una interesada, él está seguro de tu amor así que deja de un lado ese estúpido orgullo y usa la maldita tarjeta. Además como él dijo, ese regalo también es para él. -Tú crees… -Sí, sí creo, ahora dame ese vestido porque nos lo llevamos. Hoy te vestirás, te maquillaras y quedaras súper sexy, saldrás con tu sexy novio y disfrutaran la velada, se besuquearan, hablaran, se volverán a besuquear y espero que tengan sexo. Empiezo a reír, esta chica siempre consigue matarme de la risa –Tú siempre piensas en sexo. -¿y tú no? Mírame a los ojos y dime que no quieres desesperadamente tener sexo con Josh – es lo que más deseo, pienso para mis adentros – lo vez, mueres por tener sexo con él. Quieres agarrar ese delicioso trasero y reclamarlo como tuyo y creo que es la hora. Ya no tienes nada que te lo impida, él ya te demostró que te ama, viaja por ti, vive y respira por ti. Ahora depende de ti darle, mejor dicho darse ese regalo por su bien y el de todos los que tenemos que presenciar sus demostraciones de afecto. -Es que… es que…. -Es que nada. Dime, dime que dudas de que te amé y te entenderé porque no quieres hacerlo – reflexiono por un momento y se la respuesta. Él me ama como yo a él, es todo lo que necesito saber. -Tienes razón – le sonrío y tomo su mano – vamos, necesito comprar unas cosas más antes de volver. Salimos de la tienda y entramos a la que estaba buscando. Conseguí exactamente lo que quería. Cuando caminamos de regreso al hotel, vi un centro artesanal y hubo algo que me llamo la atención. Era tallado en madera, una flor, cada pétalo era perfectamente tallado y formaba coronas, varias capas y en la parte superior había un vidrio de forma redonda simulando la parte central de la flor. La tome entre mis manos. Encajaba perfectamente en ellas. -Es única en su especie. La hice yo mismo – un anciano me sonrío – tiene una sorpresa. Puedo tallar 4 frases en letras muy pequeñas que no se notaran, pero si te acercas y observas por el vidrio se verán claramente. Si giras capa por capa de pétalos aparecerá una frase diferente. Me acerque al espejo y tenía razón, era una especie de lupa. Y fue cuando supe que era el regalo perfecto para Josh y sabía exactamente lo que quería que dijera. Volvimos al hotel y nuestra suite estaba vacía. Fernanda me arrastró a nuestra habitación, me empujo a la ducha y se dedicó a arreglarme. No sé cuántas horas pasaron pero mi trasero dolía de estar sentada dejando que ella me preparará. Se dedicó a ordenar rizo por rizo algo que yo nunca he hecho y le tomo demasiado tiempo, primero crema para peinar, luego lo peinaba, lo acomodaba y finalmente un poco de spray para que permanezca de esa manera. Mi maquillaje fue sexy en realidad. Mis ojos tenían el estilo ahumado y mis labios eran rojos como el vestido. Todo el conjunto era perfecto. El atardecer estaba cerca para cuando empecé a colocarme mi vestido, alguien golpeo la puerta. Santy entro a nuestra habitación con un pequeño arregla floral de esos que los envuelves en tu muñeca. -Te ves preciosa pequeña, tú príncipe está esperando en el recibidor. -Gracias – dije poniéndome de pie – los quiero chicos, por favor no se maten mientras estemos fuera. Feliz San Valentín. Les di a cada uno de ellos un abrazo y salí de la suite, baje por el ascensor y cuando se abrió mi boca se secó. Ahí estaba Josh, con un pantalón negro y una camisa de gasa blanca con los dos botones superiores sin cerrar mostrando un ligero vello de su pecho. Si creí que mi boca se secó, cuando me miro y una gran sonrisa se formó en su rostro prácticamente empecé a babear. Tomo mi mano donde tenía el pequeño arreglo flora y la beso inclinándose como se acostumbraba en otras épocas. -Es un placer mi preciosa dama – me ruborice, sin sentido, pero lo hice – estas preciosa princesa, siempre lo estas pero esta noche más. -Y usted también señor Hutcherson, muy elegante. -¿Solo elegante? Dame más crédito – me atrajo hacia él desde mi cintura. -Eres un engreído – le di un pequeño pico – Estas muy guapo, ¿feliz? -Solo un poco, ahora vamos que tenemos una noche larga. Salimos del hotel tomados de la mano y el me dirigió hacia la orilla. Cuando la arena no me dejo caminar porque mis tacones se hundían, decidí quitármelos, pero Josh me cargó en sus brazos. Me abrace a su cuello mientras el sonido de las olas y el viento marino nos acompañaban. -¿A dónde vamos? -Ya casi llegamos y lo sabrás pequeña curiosa. Me llevo en brazos hasta que en nuestro campo visual apareció una pequeña cabaña, la luz se filtraba por sus ventanas a pesar de que aún no era oscuro afuera. Tenía una gran terraza con vista al mar y grandes ventanales que reflejan la belleza de su diseño interior. Josh me bajo al inicio de los escalones que nos dirigían a la entrada. -¿Cómo conseguiste este lugar? -Un chico tiene sus contactos – cuan levante mi ceja, continuo – el dueño del hotel es el dueño y me lo presto luego de firma unos autógrafos y posar para unas fotos. -Ja te aprovechas de los demás solo porque eres famoso. -En otras condiciones me sintiera mal por ello, pero por esta vez me alegro de haberlo hecho. Abrió la puerta y me permitió avanzar primero. El decorado de la cabaña era muy hermoso, tenía un estilo rustico, muebles muy esponjosos acomodados y con muchos cojines alrededor de una chimenea que estaba encendida. Podía ver el pasillo que llevaba a las habitaciones, pero Josh me dirigió hacia la terraza donde había una mesa para dos, con platos listos para degustar, con flores y velas decorando y champagne enfriándose a un lado; no lo había notado cuando nos aproximábamos a la cabaña. -Por aquí mademoiselle – reí con su imitación de acento francés, fue totalmente ridículo – no me juzgues, apenas domino el español no puedes esperar que hable un correcto francés. -¿Así que esta es la gran sorpresa? -Primero cenemos y conforme avance la velada lo descubrirás – ambos nos sentamos y empezamos a cenar. La comida estaba exquisita, era una mezcla de mariscos cada uno en diferentes salsas. Reímos toda la cena, burlándonos por el pésimo acento de Josh y mi nulo conocimiento sobre el idioma. Mi novio destapó el champagne y nos sirvió dos copas. Nos pusimos de pie y fuimos hacia el barandal para apreciar el atardecer. Me entrego la copa y con su mano libre me atrajo hacia él. -Quiero brindar por ti, por nuestro amor, por lo felices que somos, por lo felices que seremos. Quiero brindar para agradecer a la vida por ponerte en mi camino y porque nunca nos separaremos. Quiero brindar por que te amo como nunca nadie te amará porque nadie podrá hacerlo de la manera que yo lo hago. Lágrimas amenazaban por salir, las palabras quedaron atrapadas en mi garganta, solo pude acercare y besarlo. Un beso sutil, delicado y dulce, donde le decía lo mucho que lo amaba y lo agradecida que estaba por tenerlo. El levanto su copa y yo la mía, cuando el líquido pasó por mis labios, sentí un pequeño golpe contra ellos. Mire mi copa y encontré un pequeño anillo en él. Termine el líquido y lo tome entre mis manos. Era una pequeña banda de plata que se juntada formando el signo del infinito. Su delicadeza y sencillez la hacía hermosa. Mire hacia Josh que había asentado nuestras copas en él barandal y me miraba fijamente. -¿Infinito? – le pregunte. Él tomó el anillo y empezó a deslizarlo en mi dedo anular izquierdo. -No es un anillo de compromiso, aunque algún día te pondré uno de esos en tu dedo. Es un anillo de promesa, un anillo que quiere decirte que mi amor por ti es indescriptible y nunca tendrá final. Un signo de que pase lo que pase lucharé por ti. -Te amo Josh – no besamos, y fue otro beso sutil. Como si nuestros labios quisieran memorizar el recuerdo. Un beso perfecto. -¿Eres feliz princesa? – junto nuestras frentes. -Lo soy… mucho. -Pues ahora vamos adentro por tu otro regalo. -¿Otro? – le pregunte y se alejó de mí para ir en busca de él. Cuando regresó tenía un paquete rectangular. Me lo entrego y rasque el papel que lo envolvía – Oh Josh. -Tenía que completar la colección – tenía \"Sinsajo\" entre mis manos, lo abrí y descubrí que también estaba autografiado. -Adoro tus ocurrencias pequeño – el sol empezó a ocultarse por el horizonte, el atardecer estaba en su más bello auge. Deje el libro sobre la mesa y tome su mano para llevarlo hasta la orilla. Caminamos por la terraza, bajamos por las escaleras, caminamos un poco por la playa. En el mismo momento que mis pies entraron en contacto con la arena, desee quitarme los zapatos para poder sentir esa adorada textura entre mis dedos. - Será mejor que ambos nos quitemos nuestros zapatos – sonrió, hicimos lo que sugirió - ¿tienes frío?- con mis dedos le hice una seña con la que le daba a entender que solo tenía un poco de frío. Josh me impulso con su mano para que caminará delante de él, sorpresivamente la mano que llevaba entre las suyas cambio de lugar para dividir en dos mi pecho - Dame tu otra mano - le tendí mi otra mano y volvió a repetir el procedimiento en sentido contrario, mis brazos quedaron cruzados en torno a mi pecho, como si me abrazara a mí misma pero con las manos de mi novio entre las mías y mi cuerpo apoyado al suyo- crees que puedas caminar así conmigo?- pregunto apoyando la cabeza en mi hombro, asentí. Caminos hasta donde la arena estaba mojada por la marea, los últimos rayos de sol se colaban por entre las nubes tiñendo todo de naranja. Josh se separó de mí solo el tiempo necesario para extender la manta sobre la blanca arena, acomodarse en ella y acomodarme a mí entre sus piernas. Me recosté contra su pecho, lista para contemplar el atardecer y las olas del inmenso océano que teníamos frente a nosotros. Juntos. Con nuestros dedos entrelazados y la mirada al infinito. El cielo naranja cambio a purpura y fue cuando apareció la primera estrella. -Pide un deseo – le dije. -Tengo todo lo que deseo justo aquí –bese su mejilla. Mi chico era cursi. -Pues yo ya pedí mi deseo. -y supongo que no me lo dirás ¿verdad? -Si te digo no se cumplirá. -Esta vez lo dejare pasar solo porque quero que todos tus sueños se cumplan – este chico sabe cómo hacerme sonreír tontamente. Luego de un rato de silencio, me preguntó – Santy mencionó algo sobre tu familia que tenía que ver con mellizos. -Oh… si te lo digo debes prometer no asustarte – asintió animándome a continuar – en mi familia la mayoría de mujeres se embarazan en su vida por lo menos una vez de mellizos. Ya conociste alguna de mis primos y primas mellizas. Conoces a mi prima Patricia y a las nenas que son mellizas, aunque primero tuvo una sola niña. Mi mamá también tuvo mellizos. -¿En serio? -No te lo había contado. Andrés tuvo una melliza, pero falleció luego de nacer porque mi mami tuvo un problema de presión alta durante el embarazo y el parto. Pero también hubo mellizos ahí. -Eso suena interesante. ¿Por qué tuve que prometer que no me asustaría? -Creo que todos los chicos huirían al pensar que por un desliz o lo que sea tendrán que criar a dos niños de una. -Otros chicos quizás, pero yo fuera el hombre más feliz teniéndote embarazada y muchos más de dos muchachotes, porque espero que sean niños, sería más rápido formar mi propio equipo deportivo aunque dos princesas a quienes cuidar, engreír, mimar no estaría mal. Pero cuando fueran adolescentes voy a tener que cuidarlas porque definitivamente no tendrán novio por lo menos hasta los veintiuno, espera no hasta los treinta porque… Le tape la boca con mi mano para que se callara. Empezó a hablar como loco y tenía que reflexionar sobre su discurso. - ¿En verdad quieres que tengamos niños? Es decir… ¿Tú y yo? -Eso sería otro sueño cumplido y con tu condición genética podremos armar nuestro propio equipo, no estoy seguro si de futbol o baloncesto, creo que podrían entrenar ambos, y las niñas podrían ser porristas, pero no me opongo si quieren practicar otro deporte… Tuve que cubrir su boca nuevamente. Una gran sonrisa en mi rostro se plasmó, imposible de quitarla. Cuando quite mi mano él me sonreía también - ¿Qué? – me preguntó. -Eres un chico especial Hutcherson. -La idea me emociona demasiado. Tener una docena de pequeños llamándome papá y a ti mamá, corriendo en el patio de nuestra casa, haciendo travesuras, jugando con nuestros perros. Serán preciosos, sobre todo si se parecen a ti, si sacan tu talento, tú dulzura, tu carácter… -¡Josh! – Le grite para que parara de hablar - ¿Una docena? ¿Pretendes tenerme embarazada hasta que me llegue la menopausia? Y también quiero dos gatos persas. No pensé que su sonrisa podía agrandarse más pero lo hizo. Mi corazón se sentía tan feliz al planear un futuro juntos. Y sé que el compartía esa misma felicidad – Te amo, y seré el más feliz cuando cumplamos esos sueños. Podemos tener los hijos que quieras, uno o cien, lo que a ti te parezca bien y claro que tendremos gatos, todos los que quieras. -Bueno, el número de niños será el que Dios quiera darnos, y quisiera que fueran muchos también, pero no creo que sea buena idea tenerlos muy seguidos, quiero poder darles el tiempo suficiente a cada uno. -Lo que tú quieras, mi amor. Me has hecho el hombre más feliz de la vida. He estado soñando con el momento en que habláramos de nuestro futuro y ahora no puedo esperar a empezar a hacer ese futuro. Ambos estábamos extasiados, y sé que este es el momento perfecto para terminar de amarnos. Para consumar nuestro amor, para dejarnos llevar por la pasión. – Entonces empecemos. Me coloque a horcajadas sobre él y lo bese de la forma y con la fuerza que sé que lo hace gemir. Sus manos fueron a mis muslos y viajaron de arriba abajo y de regreso por ellos, quemando la piel que tocaba. Me frote sobre él para encenderlo más y que no hubiera duda de lo que quiero hacer. Se separó de nuestro fogoso beso y trato de normalizar la respiración. - ¿Estas segura? No quiero que te sientas obligada por todo lo que ha pasado esta noche. No me importa si tengo que esperar hasta casarnos para hacer el amor. Solo quiero que estés segura, que no te arrepientas luego, porque habrá un punto en que no pueda parar. Pero si dices que pare ahora, no me importará porque te amo y no importa esperar. Así que por favor dime si estas segura. -¿Me amas? – mire a sus ojos donde sus respuesta gritaba. -Más que a mi vida. -Entonces si estoy completamente segura – me puse de pie y tire de él. Recogió la manta e hizo una especia de bolsa para nuestros zapatos. Luego en cargo entre sus brazos aun llevando el bulto. Me llevo por las escaleras y arrojo nuestras cosas en algún sitio mientras me llevaba dentro de la cabaña. Me llevaba directo a una habitación cuando le hice una seña de no querer ir ahí. Me siento como si invadiera un lugar que no es mío así que prefiero quedarme en la sala. Conmigo aun en sus brazos, tiró todos los cojines al suelo, sobre la esponjosa alfombra que se encontraba frente a la chimenea. Me recostó sobre ella y los cojines con delicadeza, sin romper el contacto visual. Y ahí me beso, como si fuera el elixir para la vida eterna, como si mis labios fueran agua y él un sediento en el desierto, como si su vida dependiera de ello. Creo que así era porque la mía si dependía de él y sus besos. Y fue así como me llevo hacia las puertas del cielo. HOOOOOLA :) COMO LES PROMETÍ LOS CAPÍTULOS SON MUCHO MAS LARGOS..

NOS LEEMOS LUEGO -3 MILET AVANCE: Sus manos tomaban mi camisa y trataban de tirar de ella pero el nerviosismo le hacía fallar. Me la saque yo mismo de un tirón y la arrojé lejos. -Fanfarrón. Ella me miro como si fuera lo que más deseaba e esta vida. Recorrió con sus dedos todo mi torso con suma delicadeza, como si quisiera memorizar la textura de mi piel. Llego al botón de mi pantalón y lo deshizo. Me lo quite rápidamente, no podía negar lo ansioso que estaba. -Tú aún llevas ropa, tendremos que solucionar eso[Chapter 47] Capítulo 47 Sus labios bajo los míos se sentían como piezas que fueron alguna vez separadas y ahora encajaban. Mi cuerpo temblaba ante la anticipación, era como si fuera mi primera vez, porque lo era, era la primera vez que haría el amor, una primera vez para ambos y quería que fuera inolvidable. Los besos se tornaron más apasionados, abandone sus labios para ocuparme de su exquisito cuello. Lamí, mordí, bese esa zona que tanto me gusta y cuando un gemido escapo de su boca me sentí al borde de la excitación. -Josh, por favor…. – su voz apenas era un suspiro, solo la escuchaba porque mi oído estaba cerca de su boca.- Josh, para…- Parar no, por favor, no ahora. Me tomó toda mi voluntad detener mis manos viajeras y poner una buena cara antes de mirarla. Sus labios estaban hinchados y su respiración era irregular y superficial. Sus ojos me pedían que siguiera pero su boca me hizo detenerme. -Aun no te doy mi regalo – me sonrío divertida. -Puedes dármelo luego – volví a atacar su cuello. -Prefiero hacerlo ahora – no sé como pero se escabulló por debajo de mí y me dejó ahí todo \"emocionado\". Logré sentarme con dificultad ya que estos pantalones dejaron de ser lo suficientemente cómodos hace ya un buen rato. Cuando regresó tenía algo entre sus manos. Se puso de rodillas enfrente de mí y me entregó una pequeña cajita. Me sonrío cuando empecé a retirar el papel que la envolvía. Era una flor tallada en madera, una artesanía en verdad preciosa y en su centro un pequeño círculo de vidrio le daba el detalle perfecto. -Es hermoso. Gracias. -Eso no es todo tontito, tienes que mirar por el vidrio. A pesar de la poca luz, la cual apenas provenía del fuego de la chimenea, pude observar que el espejo hacia una especie de lupa y había una frase que podía leer en el fondo. La leí en voz alta – Quédate conmigo… Siempre. -Sé que es cursi, pero creo que tiene algún significado importante para nosotros. -Si – me quede mirando esas palabras, cuando ella tomo la rosa y giro una de las capas de pétalos y me hizo una seña para que la viera nuevamente – Te Amo y es REAL. - Perdóname por ser una tributo obsesionada. Vamos gira de nuevo. – lo hice y procedí a ver la siguiente frase. -Agradezco a Dios por haberte puesto en mi camino, eres todo para mí. -Tú también lo eres pequeña, eres todo lo que necesito para vivir. -Vamos, gira de nuevo. Es la última y podemos regresar a lo que estábamos – su mirada pícara me hizo reír. Así que de nuevo me acerque para leer. -Mi amor por ti es infinito, más que el universo, Te amo, mil veces TE AMO. Quiero compartir un para siempre solo contigo. Alex. – me quede meditando sus palabras. Ella había pensado en un futuro juntos antes de nuestra conversación y eso me emociona aún más, saber que ella me ama con la misma intensidad que yo. -Ahora sí, deja eso a un lado y continuemos donde nos quedamos. – lo deposite con cuidado en uno de los muebles. Era lo más bonito que me han regalado, de pronto lo único que importaba es tenerla entre mis brazos. Me puse de pie y le ofrecí mi mano. -Baila conmigo, princesa. -No tenemos música, pequeño – dijo mientras se ponía de pie. Me acerque al estéreo y me di cuenta que no tenía discos que poner. Busque en un memoria interna donde encontré una única canción, gracias al cielo que era una que he querido dedicarle a mi novia pero no encontraba el momento, creo que este es el adecuado. Pulse play y me acerqué a ella. (You and Me – Lifehouse: www_youtube_com/watch?v=rSTejLuYENM ) La apreté a mi cuerpo por su cintura y sus brazos se enrollaron en mi cuello. Le susurré un PARA TI, en el oído y nos balanceábamos al ritmo suave de la canción mientras nuestras miradas no se despegaban y nuestros corazones golpeteaban al ritmo de la melodía. Ese era yo, un hombre perdidamente enamorada, queriendo explicar la grandeza de mis sentimientos mediante una melodía, solo para ella. La canción termino y ella me besó. La canción volvió a repetirse debido a que era la única que existía, pero nada más importo cuando sus labios acariciaban los míos. Sus manos tomaban mi camisa y trataban de tirar de ella pero el nerviosismo le hacía fallar. Me la saque yo mismo de un tirón y la arrojé lejos. -Fanfarrón. Ella me miro como si fuera lo que más deseaba e esta vida. Recorrió con sus dedos todo mi torso con suma delicadeza, como si quisiera memorizar la textura de mi piel. Llego al botón de mi pantalón y lo deshizo. Me lo quite rápidamente, no podía negar lo ansioso que estaba. -Tú aún llevas ropa, tendremos que solucionar eso – empecé a acecharla cuando ella me detuvó y me empujó contra el mueble. Me senté de golpe. Ella retrocedió unos pasos, para que pueda admirarla. Sus manos viajaron hacia su espalda y el sonido de su cremallera bajando hizo que mi excitación aumentara aún más. -Gracias por lo de tu tarjeta, pero tengo que informarte que tu cuenta saldrá un poquito alta este mes – me guiño un ojo con picardía. -El dinero no importa, pero no creo que un simple vestido me deje en banca rota. -Oh, es que no fue solo un vestido – la tela roja se deslizo por su cuerpo y formó un montón a sus pies. Ella lo arrojó hacia un lado antes de mirarme con expectación. Esa mujer y su exquisito cuerpo estaban frente a mí luciendo con la lencería más sexy de encaje negro que alguna vez pensé verla. Era hermosa, malditamente hermosa, tanto que dolía. -Gracias al cielo existe Victoria Secret – tomo sus manos y la atraje hacia mí. Se sentó a horcajadas, con sus rodillas a cada lado de mis piernas. – si tuviera que quedarme en banca rota por comprarte lencería, maldita sea que no me importaría en absoluto. Trabajara como animal solo por verte así de sexy. No sé qué hice para merecerte pero soy un maldito afortunado. -Eres un sucio. -Tú eres la sucia por provocarme de esta manera. Pero sabes que te verás aún mejor sin esas pequeñas piezas – de un toque abrí la llave de su sujetador, me miró con intriga – He tenido un poco de práctica. Trate de besarla pero ella se alejó de mí. Se puso de pie nuevamente y con un movimiento fluido como si bailara se quitó ese pedazo de tela que afloje y lo arrojó hacia un lado. Y ahí fue cuando me quede sin palabras. Otra vez termine sentado en el sofá. Lo único que puedo hacer es abalanzarme hasta ella para capturar sus labios. Ella responde ante mi beso, que cada vez se hace más demandante. Sin darme cuenta tengo ambas de mis manos agarrado a su cintura de una manera bastante posesiva, y ella se acomoda nuevamente sobre mis piernas, con las suyas en mis ambos lados. Ella sigue demandante con sus besos al igual que yo, ni siquiera sé si ahora mismo está siendo consciente de lo que está pasando, pero lo que sí puedo asegurar es que mi \"amiguito\" es demasiado consciente. Hermosa, esta mujer es lo más hermoso que existe en este universo. La sensación que me dio al sentir su pecho desnudo sobre el mío me hizo exhalar una gran cantidad de aire por la boca y escuchar sus pequeños gemidos de satisfacción mientras me deleitaba con su cuello hacia crecer mi lujuria. De alguna manera logro ponerme de pie con ella en mis brazos. La depositó como si fuese un bebe en la alfombra mientras me recostaba sobre ella. Besé su frente, sus ojos y por último en sus labios, solo que esta vez nuestros labios lucharon por la dominación. Nos giró quedando ella sobre mí. No podía dejar de gemir al sentir su lengua en mi boca cuando se encontraron de nuevo. Mordió mis labios suavemente y luego los chupo. Su boca, su lengua, sus labios, todo se sentía de maravilla. Quería más y ataque su boca, rogándole para que me diera más de lo que necesitaba. Mis manos se volvieron avariciosas en su cuerpo, viajaban por todo su cuerpo reconociendo cada centímetro de su tersa piel. Con sus brazos alrededor de mi cuello se pegó a mí, y antes de dejar caer mi peso sobre ella mis pantalones volaron. Se retorcía bajo mí, sabía que estaba lista tal como yo lo estaba. Separe de ella para admirarla por otro momento, su cabello un poco enredado, sus mejillas sonrosadas, sus labios entreabiertos, su piel uniforme y sus senos… ohhh, sus senos. Lleve mi boca a su seno izquierdo comencé a repartir pequeños besitos en todo su contorno, cuando la punta de su pezón se irguió, indicándome que ella era susceptible a mis caricias, lo atrape con mis labios y empecé a succionar con vehemencia a lo que Alex me respondió llevando sus manos a mi cabello. Use la misma dedicación a su otro seno y sonreí como estúpido cuando un largo suspiro/gemido escapó de sus labios. Abandone su pecho, sin despegar los labios de su piel dibuje un camino por su abdomen. Cuando llegue a su ombligo y lo acaricie con mi lengua deleitándome con más gemidos de satisfacción de su parte. Continúe mi viaje hasta que me encontré con esa pequeña pieza de encaje sexy que ella uso para mí. Mi ego masculino creció inmediatamente mientras delineaba con mis labios el contorno donde se fusionaba el encaje con su piel. Necesitaba quitar esa barrera de en medio. Con mis dedos tome la pieza y la miren antes de procedes. Con un asentimiento, tire de la pieza hacia abajo. Cuando la saque por sus pantorrillas comencé a dar pequeños besos en esa zona y tracé la ruta de regreso desde sus pantorrillas hasta sus muslos dejando un camino húmedo a todo lo largo. Cuando llegue a su intimidad, mi lujuria me incito a poner mis labios ahí. Ella soltó un gran gemido cuando la besé. Quería verla llegar a un orgasmo de esta forma, pero este no era el momento adecuado, más adelante quizás tendríamos la oportunidad, Dios quiera que sí, era una meta por cumplir. Aparte esas fantasías de mi mente y volví a subir marcando el camino que me llevaría a sus labios, pasando por su abdomen y el valle de sus senos, por su clavícula donde me detuve algunos segundos. Besar su cuello me pareció sumamente interesante al descubrir que con cada chupada provocaba que se restregara un poco a mí, pase por su oreja no sin antes regalarle un mordisco a su lóbulo lo que hizo que comenzara a reír, arrancándome a mí una gran sonrisa pues Alex tenía la peculiaridad de que en esa zona cualquier caricia le producía cosquillas, subí hacia su mandíbula por allí solo la acaricie con la punta de mi nariz, cuando estuve cerca de sus labios fue ella la que me deposito un sencillo pero que a mí me pareció un hermoso beso en mi nariz. -Te quiero dentro de mí – me pido con esa mirada llena de deseo. Deseo por mí. Soy un maldito afortunado. Lo que más deseaba, era sentirla, y disfrutar de ella de lo que quisiera darme. Cumpliría todos sus deseos, solo debe pedírmelo. Me acomodé un poco entre sus piernas, roce su entrada con mi miembro a lo que ella dio una gran bocanada de anticipación. – Esto va a doler, si quieres que me detenga, solo dilo. Ella solo me besó con fuerza y correspondí con la misma entrega mientras me hundía en ella quitando toda barrera que indicaba su pureza – Eres mía. Sus ojos se cerraron por un momento, debió sentir dolor. Quisiera quitar ese dolor, no quiero que ella sufra. Empecé a retirarme cuando ella me apretó con sus piernas envueltas en torno a mi cintura. – Tranquilo, está bien. Dolió, pero estoy bien, no te detengas. -Te amo – necesitaba decírselo. Necesitaba que supiera que haría todo por ella, que estaba feliz por hacer el amor, que soy el más afortunado por tenerla. -Yo también te amo – besé las lágrimas que resbalaron a cada lado de su rostro. Me sentía tan bien dentro de ella. Encajamos muy bien. Como si siempre hubiéramos sido el uno para el otro. Me separé de ella y volví a entrar, con toda la delicadeza que pude y su rostro se contrajo de dolor como mi corazón al verla sufrirlo – Tranquilo, estoy bien, es normal ¿recuerdas? Mi cuerpo se está adaptando a tu no tan pequeño amigo dentro de mí. Sonreí cuando su tono pícaro se hizo presente al nombra a \"mi amigo\" – Tienes razón, mi amigo es un graaaaaan amigo. -Fanfarrón – ambos nos carcajeamos durante un rato y luego la beso. Con mis brazos la pego más a mí, cuando ella me susurra: -Hazlo de nuevo. -¿Otra vez? No quiero que te duela. -Hazlo – salí y entre nuevamente y esta vez su rostro se relajó. -¿Una vez más? – le pregunto cuando mi cuerpo empezó a encenderse nuevamente. -Una vez más – arremetí contra ella nuevamente, cuando vi que se relajaba y los gemidos abandonaban sus labios por el placer lo hice con más fuerza y más rápido. Luego ella empezó a levantar sus caderas para encontrarme en medio camino. Yo estaba tan caliente, tan al borde del éxtasis. Nuestros gemidos resonaban en el silencio de la noche y empezamos a ahogarlos con nuestros besos. La besé aún más duro, mientras mis manos acariciaban y me ayudaban a mantener el ritmo en sus caderas, su cuerpo se balanceaba en clara amenaza de lo que se convertiría en pocos minutos esta danza intima. Me permití ir más profundo cuando enrosco sus piernas alrededor de mi cintura apretando fuerte. Sus talones presionaban en mi trasero volviendo más loco aun. Sus manos viajaron rápidamente para acariciar desenfrenadamente mi cabello. A los pocos minutos, después de que mis arremetidas fueron más rápidas arrebatándonos a ambos unos cuantos gemidos y uno que otro gruñido, la sentí tensarse en su interior sus manos acariciaban desenfrenadamente mi espalda, sus gimoteos se hicieron más fuertes, mi nombre salía de sus labios sin cesar, pero antes de que llegara al climax, me tomó del cabello suavemente y me obligó a mirarla. Mis labios descendieron sobre ella, y la besé con ferocidad, queriendo hacerle saber lo mucho que esto significaba para mí. Estaba alcanzando las puertas del cielo cuando mi cuerpo se estremeció mientras mi orgasmo me alcanzó, logre decirle que la amo con mi último aliento, antes de caer cubriendo su cuerpo con el mío. Ella gimió audiblemente cuando sintió la calidez de mi esencia dentro de su cuerpo, llegando al cielo solo un segundo después de mí. Yo respiraba entrecortado y enterré mi cabeza en su cuello mientras con mi mano acariciaba la tersa piel de uno de sus pechos. Con la boca, le prodigaba suaves besos en el cuello. Cuando me sentía un poco más calmado levante la mirada para verla, y ella me miraba a los ojos. -Te amo Josh… esto fue perfecto. -Tú eres perfecta. Te amo hermosa – me acomode lo suficiente para besar el exilir que me brinda el sentir sus labios contra los míos. No pude evitar sonreír, ella también lo hacía y quise congelar ese momento para siempre, porque este era nuestro mundo perfecto, estos éramos nosotros, amándonos con todo lo que tenemos, con nuestros corazones, nuestras almas y cuerpos… Nada ni nadie me alejará de ella. HOOOOOLA... q tal? es la primera vez q escribo este tipo de interacción hot.. espero haberlo hecho bien.. algo interesante pero no muy pasado :) espero sus comentarios.. animenme a seguir escribiendo y perdon x la demora tratare de actualizar lo mas pronto posible... sigo esperando sus comentarios con recomendaciones musicales, predicciones sobre que sucedera.. denme ideas.. ando medio bloqueada :) gracias x sus reviews y pm :) nos leemos luego :) -3 Milet AVANCE: Regrese al recibidor cuando Josh volvía por el pasillo desde su habitación. -Bien, los encontré – me dijo en tono serio. - Me van a escuchar esos dos – amenace furiosa. Trate de dirigirme a la habitación de Josh y Santy pero mi novio me bloqueo el paso. -No puedes entrar ahí. -¿Por qué no?[Chapter 48] Capítulo 48 Recosté mi cabeza sobre su pecho mientras nuestras respiraciones se normalizaban. Podía sentir el golpeteo de su corazón bajo mis dedos, sus golpeteos eran cada vez era más lentos al igual que mi pulso. Su mano acariciaba mi brazo y el silencio que nos envolvía era cómodo. La canción aun sonaba en el estero y a lo lejos el choque de las olas en la orilla eral lo único que acompañaba al sonido de nuestras respiraciones. -¿Estas bien? – Josh besó mi coronilla. -Mmmm muy bien – ronronee, mientras enlazaba mis piernas con las suyas – fue algo…. Espectacular, mejor de lo que me había imaginado. -¿Así que te lo has imaginado? Eso es muy sucio de tu parte – su ceja de levantaba y la picardía de su mirada me hizo sonreír a un más. -Bueno, pues tú eres el gran culpable de que mi mente inocente ahora divague sobre tú sobre mí, desnudo, gimiendo, besándome… -Ok, si sigues hablando me vas a tener gimiendo y haciéndote gemir de nuevo…. – luego de un par de besos dulces, acuno mi rostro con sus manos, sus pulgares acariciaban mi mandíbula – Te amo… siento que la palabra se queda corta pero no encuentro una mejor. Eres todo lo que necesito, lo que siempre he querido. Gracias por esta noche, gracias por hacerme feliz… -Tú también me haces feliz, Josh. Nunca pensé que esto se pueda sentir por una persona. Creí haber amado antes pero no se compara, no fue así de grande. Solo puedo pensar en lo feliz que me siento, en lo completa que es mi vida cuando estas a mi lado… - nos quedamos en silencio por otro momento. Recordé lo que Josh me pregunto ayer. Creo que es el momento de que le cuente mi secreto. - Sabes… tengo miedo a darme por vencida – él me mira incrédulo – tengo miedo de cansarme y dejar de luchar... tengo miedo de morir… porque no peleé lo suficiente. -Creo que todos tenemos miedo a morir… -No, no entiendes, Josh – su semblante se tornó triste, por lo que continúe – cuando tenía 6 años me diagnosticaron leucemia. Estuve muchas veces al borde de morir, por la misma enfermedad, por infecciones oportunistas, porque la quimioterapia deñaba mi riñón. Cualquier cosa me quería matar. Estuve por 3 años en tratamiento hasta que por fin estuve sana. Cada día despertaba con miedo de que sea el último. Esperaba que me reclame por no haberle dicho antes, pero el solo me apretó más contra él. Lágrimas empezaron a caer por mis mejillas, per sus labios estaban ahí para secarlas – Una niña de 6 años tiene su vida planeada. Quiere ser la princesa de su historia. Crecer, encontrar a su príncipe, tener bebés…. Tener su \"felices para siempre\". Yo solo sabía que no iba a tener eso. Mis lágrimas caían mojando su pecho. Josh no dijo nada, solo me abrazaba. Es todo lo que podía hacer, las palabras no hacían falta en estos momentos. Todo lo que necesitaba era a él, su amor, su apoyo, su comprensión. - Es por eso que se me hace difícil planear un futuro. Sé que las cosas nunca son seguras. -Es por ello que te sentiste tan mal cuando aquel pequeño falleció. Te sentiste identificada y sufriste y yo no te supe entender - Nos quedamos otro largo momento en silencio - Permíteme que te de tu final feliz. Permíteme darte todo lo que deseas y mereces. Quiero ser el príncipe y darte tu historia feliz. Eres la persona más fuerte que he conocido, sé que nunca dejaras de luchas, no puedes, no serías tú si te dieras por vencida. Te amo y solo para que lo sepas, mi mayor temor es perderte. -Te amo tanto Josh, nunca… nunca me dejes – y entre besos las lágrimas se fueron y volvimos a hacer el amor. En total fueron cuatro veces más en las que terminamos dejándonos llevar por la pasión, hasta que nos dormidos en los brazos del otro. Cuando desperté aun esta enredad entre los brazos de Josh. Mi espala en su pecho y nuestros brazos aferrado al cuerpo del otro. Con cuidado de no despertarlo, salí de nuestra cama improvisada. Nuestra ropa estaba tirada por todos lados. Encontré mi ropa interior y me la puse. Miré mi vestido pero decidí ponerme la camisa de Josh que lucía mucho más cómoda. Salí a la terraza para contemplar el amanecer. La brisa fría de la madrigada golpeó mis mejillas haciéndome estremecer por la temperatura. Sentí los brazos de Josh enredarse a mi alrededor. Recosté mi cabeza en su hombro y sus labios en mi cuello me relajaron aún más. Miramos juntos con el sol salía y el día se levantaba. Los colores del cielo cambiaban, mi mundo cambiaba, era otro después de anoche. -Esto es hermoso – susurré. -No tanto como tú – pude sentir su apreciación de mi traje por un momento y luego me atrajo de nuevo - y mucho más en mi camisa… y ni se diga desnuda, eso no tiene comparación – definitivamente mi cuello y mi rostro deben estar rojos, siento la sangre calentar esas partes – definitivamente tengo que saber cómo puedes ponerte de ese color con el tono de tu piel. -Probablemente es un misterio que nunca resolverás. -Vamos preciosa – tiro de mi hacia el interior de la cabaña – es momento de que alimente a mi mujer. -Yo no tengo hambre. -Pues yo sí – una sonrisa pícara se extendió por su rostro. -¿Y que se te antoja? - A ti – me cargo en sus brazos y yo enrede mis piernas en su cintura. Una vez más terminamos haciendo el amor. Pateo mi trasero mentalmente por no haber hecho esto antes y me pregunto si algún día me cansaré de ello. Luego nos duchamos juntos, supuestamente para ahorrar tiempo pero creo que fue una muy mala idea ya que la limpieza quedo en segundo plano al igual que apresurarnos, nos vestimos y empezamos a volver al hotel. Apenas eran 8h30 de la mañana pero teníamos que regresar con nuestros amigos. Conociendo a Fernanda y Santiago, temía que ya se hayan sacado los ojos; además teníamos este día para disfrutar en la playa antes de volver. Tomados de la mano, atravesamos toda la playa. Ambos descalzos. Nuestros dedos en la arena que apenas se calentaba con el sol mañanero. Jugamos durante todo el camino, muchas veces él me cargaba y me amenazaba con lanzarme al mar. Todo era como un cuento de hadas… era mi historia feliz. Cuando entramos en nuestra habitación, lo primero que vimos fue las botellas de licor en el pequeño recibidor, luego caí en cuenta que el sofá estaba volteado sobre su respaldar, los almohadones tirados por todos lados como si in tifón hubiera arruinado la habitación. Me solté de Josh y fui a mi habitación en busca de Fernanda. Cuando entre en la habitación que compartía con ella estaba vacía. Por lo menos no la habían destrozado. Regrese al recibidor cuando Josh volvía por el pasillo desde su habitación. -Bien, los encontré – me dijo en tono serio. - Me van a escuchar esos dos – amenace furiosa. Trate de dirigirme a la habitación de Josh y Santy pero mi novio me bloqueo el paso. -No puedes entrar ahí. -¿Por qué no? – tenía que mandarlos por un tubo. -Digamos que no fuimos los únicos que disfrutaron la noche – me tomo un par de segundo entender sus palabras. -Diablos. ¡No puedo creerlo! ¿Qué mierda estaban pensando esos dos? - Otra vez intenté ir a esa habitación, pero Josh me sujeto de la cintura – Déjame, maldita sea Josh. Ellos están locos. Sobretodo Santiago. Su agarre no se aflojaba - Fernanda lo quiere y él se aprovecha. Tiene novia, Josh. Dudo mucho que deje a Lisset ¿Dónde deja eso a mi amiga? -Cálmate Alexandra – yo seguía pataleando. Josh me sostuvo contra la pared, tomo mis muñecas y las sujeto a cada lado de mi cara. Sin que pudiera reaccionar, su beso me arrastró en un torbellino pasional. Hizo que me olvide de todo y más cuando levanto por mis muslos posicionándome en sus caderas. Podía sentir cuanto me deseaba. Mis manos instintivamente se enredaron en su cuello. Mis dedos se hundieron en sus cabellos atrayéndolo más aún, si eso era posible. Mi cuerpo reaccionaba a su contacto. Un pequeño CLIC nos sacó de nuestro trance. Ahí estaba mi amiga, envuelta en una sábana fugándose de la habitación y encontrándonos a nosotros bloqueando su ruta de escape. Su rostro se tornó rojo y una sombra de vergüenza apareció. No fue precisamente encontrarme a Josh y a mí a punto de tener sexo. Ella sabía que lo habíamos atrapado. Nos rodeó y fue hacia nuestra habitación cerrando la puerta tras ella. Josh me dejo en el piso Alex, conozco a Santiago desde hace poco y estoy seguro de que él no se aprovechó de ella. Ambos son adultos, saben en que se metieron. Nosotros no somos nadie para juzgarlos. Asentí y fui hacia mi cuarto. Cuando entré Fernanda seleccionaba su ropa para tomar un baño. Me dejo caer sobre mi cama. Ninguna de nosotros hablaba, ese si era un silencio incómodo. -Así que no tuvieron suficiente anoche ¿eh? – me pregunto con un toque de sarcasmo. -No trates de voltear las cosas, Fernanda. Yo no fui la que se acostó con un chico que tiene novia. -Literalmente tú eres la novia del chico con el que te acostaste, así que él si tiene novia – ambas nos reímos ante su brillante deducción. Pero la risa de mi amiga pronto se convirtió en sollozos. Corrí a abrazarla. Acaricie su espalda mientras lloraba, que decía que todo iría bien hasta que se calmó y pudo hablar. -Soy una imbécil, Alex. No sé cómo pudo pasar. En un momento estábamos tirándonos cosas, gritándonos y al siguiente estábamos besándonos. No lo detuve – sollozó- no quise detenerlo. Quise que ocurriera. Alguna parte tonta de mi albergaba la esperanza de revivir lo que antes teníamos. Fui tan estúpida. -No lo eres… simplemente lo quieres.. -Lo amo Alex. Lo amo con todo mi corazón y aunque quise engañarme a mí mismo negándolo, ya no puedo. Él no va a dejar a su novia. Me lo dijo anoche mientras nos besábamos y aun así quise tenerlo para mí. -Lo voy a matar, voy a tomar su cuello y torcerlo y … -No harás nada - me gritó - vas a olvidar todo lo que viste y sabes. Vas a ser mi amiga y hacer estoque te pido. No quiero volver a tocar ese tema, no quiero que le reclames nada. No quiero ninguna mirada de desprecio por tu parte hacia él. -No puedo dejarlo así. -Si eres mi amiga lo harás. Promételo Alexandra – su mirada de súplica me estremeció. Sabía que si no se lo prometía ella se enojaría conmigo por siempre. Y como dijo Josh, no somos quienes para juzgarla. -Te lo prometo – con ello me abrazó y luego entro en el baño. Yo también me cambie de ropa antes de que saliéramos a nuestro paseo por la playa. Josh había limpiado el recibidor para cuando salí de mi habitación. Santy se mostraba serio como Fernanda pero ninguno dijo nada. Se trataron como si nada hubiera pasado. Debo admitir que hicieron un buen trabajo porque el resto de día todos disfrutamos de nuestra excursión, aunque eso pareciera improbable. Mis hormonas aún estaban un poco revueltas. Cada vez que Josh se me acercaba quería saltarle y quitarle la ropa ahí misma. Parecía una adolescente descontrolada. No me imagino como será dormir sola sin él ahora, no puedo creer que una sola noche haya bastado para acostumbrarme a esa cercanía. Ahora comprendo cuando decían \"el amor pone tu mundo patas arriba\", mi mundo ahora es otro todo por Josh. Hola a tod s..! ¿que les pareció? Quería ir atando cabos que deje sueltos por ahí. También creo que es importante resaltar la historia de Santy y Fer ellos tendrán su papel mas importante mas adelante. El viernes salí con amigos y ya tengo preparadas muchas canciones nuevas, mas las que me han enviado. también mi mama aporto con algunas de su gusto, aunque un poco antiguas pero lo importante es el mensaje. He conocido nuevas canciones, espero que ustedes también. Quisiera saber si hubo alguna nueva para ustedes, alguna que les encantó o les impersionó? díganme cual es..! Esta semana quizás no actualice porque ando en verdad muy ocupada, llena de pruebas, trabajos. espero me entiendan. gracias por sus reviews, pm, sugerencias. espero sus comentarios, quiero saber lo que piensan que sucederá mas adelante..! Nos leemos luego -3 Milet AVANCE: Empecé a besarla de nuevo, mordí su oreja provocando un gran gemido. Ella estaba tan excitada como yo, no entiendo el porqué de detenerme. Y ahí está, otra vez empujándome con sus brazos cuando la recosté en el sofá. -¿Por qué tenemos que detenernos? – mi tono era patético. -No vamos a hacer esto, Josh…[Chapter 49] Capítulo 49 Estábamos viendo una película mientras almorzabamos, (cómo perder a un hombre en 10 días), le prometía a Alex que jamás llegaré a su casa con un perro. Solo éramos ella y yo en la casa de mis abuelos. Ellos como siempre salieron de viaje, lo que a mí naturalmente me beneficia. Tener a mi novia para mi solito es un regalo, no es que no aprecie el hecho de que ella es querida por mis abuelos, pero siempre que ella está aquí ellos me la secuestran. Ella empezó a lavar los platos cuando terminamos y yo limpie la mesa. Mientras ella terminaba, apagué la TV y fui en su busca. Envolví mis brazos en su cintura y empecé a depositar besitos en su cuello. -Basta Josh, me haces cosquillas – con su mano me lanzó agua en la cara. -Que graciosa. No me tientes a vengarme, porque tengo muchas ideas y no son sanas. -Cómo te conozco me imagino que esas ideas tuyas tiene que ver conmigo sin ropa y en horizontal – ella sí que me conocía. - Puede ser horizontal, pero deberías saber que hay muchas poses que podemos hacerlas parados – la toalla con la que se secaba las manos golpeo mi cara. - ¡lo sabía! Eres un sucio, Hutcherson. -Acepto mi culpa – me acerque a ella y tome su mano – vamos, quiero que escuches algo. La lleve hacia el jardín trasero. Ella se recostó sobre la hamaca y yo en un banco junto a ella. Tome mi guitarra, me disponía a cantarle.- Me he dado cuenta que nunca te he dedicado una canción de esta manera. Solo tú y yo. Ella se acercó y beso mi mejilla, luego se volvió a recostar. Mis dedos empezaron a entonar mi guitarra y mi mirada no se apartó de sus preciosos ojos marrones. (Kiss me – Ed Sheeran: www_youtube_com/watch?v=YmQiJOaI3QI ) El dedicarnos canciones era algo muy significativo entre nosotros. Muchas veces hace falta de una melodía para decir ciertas cosas que no se pueden expresar solo con palabras. La música nos abre un mundo de posibilidades para decir lo que sentimos y hoy quiero decirle que la amo con todo mi corazón. Unos rayos de sol se filtran entre las hojas del árbol que nos cubre y caen sobre su rostro formando figuras en su piel. Me pierdo en sus ojos marrones, siempre me ha encantado los grandes y expresivos que son. Todas las noches, es lo único que vive en mis sueños, esa mirada que de alguna manera me pertenece. Mientras sigo cantando ella cierra sus ojos. Siento el irresistible impulso de lanzarme sobre ella y besar esa sonrisa de su cara, pero primero termino mis acordes. Las últimas notas surgen de mi guitarra y no sé porque siento timidez, como si mi alma se hubiera desnudado. -Eso… fue hermoso, Josh. Gracias – su mirada soñadora me enloquece, así que me acerco y beso su mejilla – quisiera hacer lo mismo, pero nunca pude aprender a tocar la guitarra. -Yo podría enseñarte – le ofrezco. -Mmmm no creo que te convenga ofrecerte. Diego lo intento alguna vez pero en realidad soy un desastre. Un ataque de celos me atravesó rápidamente, pero desapareció cuando me di cuenta que yo podría enseñarle y seria otra cosa de la que sentirme orgulloso, algo más que indique que soy parte de su vida. Insistí para que me permitiera enseñarle, aunque se rehusó por un buen rato, terminó aceptando. Durante el siguiente par de horas impartí mis clases personalizadas de guitarra, algo que supuse que sea fácil pero luego de 2 horas, empecé a darme por vencido. -Olvídalo, me doy por vencida, no quiero volver a tener una guitarra en mis manos. -Lo lograrás – aunque pienso que le costará mucho – solo tienes que dedicarte, aprendiste los acordes rápidamente, solo tiene que dominar el rasgueo hasta que suene bien… -Admítelo Josh, en lugar de entonar en la guitarra creo que la destroce, hasta mis oídos sufrieron – se sentó de golpe en el sofá con los brazos cruzados y un ceño fruncido. No la dejaría salir de esta. -Solo debes intentarlo más – me siento junto a ella y acerco a besar esa arruga entre sus cejas que se forma cuando está molesta – no dejaré que abandones esto. Pude ver como por su mente cruzaron muchas ideas y cuando sus ojos reflejaron entusiasmo. Se acercó a mí lentamente y salto quedando a horcajadas sobre mí. Mi sangre empezó a acumularse en cierta zona cuando empezó a besarme y a restregarse contra mi cuerpo. -En lugar de perder el tiempo con la guitarra podemos hacer esto – con que ese era su plan. -No te será tan fácil zafarte de esta Alexandra – ella se apartó de mi de un brinco y mi cuerpo inmediatamente extraño su cercanía. -Tú te lo pierdes – empezó a caminar hacia la cocina – mis besos o las clases de guitarra? Tú eliges. Mi elección fue obvia. La atrape en la cocina. La bese con deseo. Mis manos agarraron sus muslos, la levantaron y la dejaron en la encimera. Ella enrollo sus piernas en mi cintura. De alguna manera logre llevarnos a la sala. La ubique en el sofá y me cerní sobre ella. -Josh, basta – me empujo con ambas manos. La mire con suplica porque no me creía capaz de detenerme, estaba demasiado caliente. Dudo que una ducha fría pueda solucionar el entusiasmo de mi amigo. -Noo, por favor – digo estrechándola aún más por su cintura – No me dejes así. Cuando no respondió me separe de ella. Cruzó los brazos bajo su pecho lo que hizo que resaltaran aún más y mi mirada lujuriosa acabó allí. Me patee mentalmente al recordar que podría estar enojada por culpa de mis alborotadas hormonas. Su ceño fruncido me confirmo mi sospecha. Sostuvimos la mirada hasta que decidí hacer algo que sabría que la haría reír. -Basta Josh, tus pucheros son patéticos – estaba seguro de que reprimía la risa, así que hice un puchero más estúpido aun y ella empezó a reír descontroladamente. Me acerque a ella y nuevamente la estreche hacia mí tomando su cintura. Mordí el lóbulo de su oreja, eso siempre la volvía loca – Josh, para. No vamos a hacer esto… -¿Por qué no? – ronroneé en su cuello. Cuando ella trato de alejarme de nuevo me detuve. – No puedes para por favor. No puedes emocionar al pequeño Joshi y luego dejarlo así. -¡No lo hiciste! – su rostro se tornó rojo y una gran risa se preparaba para salir. -¿No hice qué? -Oh por Dios. ¿Le pusiste nombre a tu pene? – ahora si cayo de bruces en el sofá carcajeándose y yo tuve sentimientos encontrados. Por un lado me sentí ofendido porque ella no le daba el debido respeto a mi amigo y por otro lado me excite aún más cuando sus labios dijeron \"pene\". Amo cuando habla sucio. -¿Por qué no iba a hacerlo? Él merece un nombre. Tiene vida propia y tú sobre todas las personas debería saber eso. T encanta jugar con él. Y cuando tú estás cerca él salta de la emoción- señalo el bulto en mis pantalones. -Probablemente eso es lo más ridículo que he escuchado – su risa me contagio y ambos reímos. Empecé a besarla de nuevo, mordí su oreja provocando un gran gemido. Ella estaba tan excitada como yo, no entiendo el porqué de detenerme. Y ahí está, otra vez empujándome con sus brazos cuando la recosté en el sofá. -¿Por qué tenemos que detenernos? – mi tono era patético. -No vamos a hacer esto, Josh… no sin protección - ¡¿Protección?! ¿Quién puede pensar en protección en estas situaciones? -¿Por qué no? Ya lo hicimos sin \"protección\" ¿Por qué te preocupas por eso ahora? - Porque cuando lo hicimos estaba al inicio de mi ciclo, es muy poco probable de que quede embarazada. Pero ahora no vamos a arriesgarnos. Así que tendrás que usar un maldito condón si quieres hacer esto. - No por favor – era patético – contigo por primera vez no me cuide porque sé que si algo sucede será solo para unirnos más…. Fue una sensación increíble – me sonrío y una punzada de culpa me atravesó porque puede que este mintiendo. Esa noche con Shannon no me cuidé, por eso tuve que obligarla a tomar un anticonceptivo de emergencia al siguiente día; pero hasta ahora ni yo comprendo cómo pasó eso, como me acosté con ella. No recuerdo lo que sucedió, solo sé que me desperté a su lado pensando que era mi novia. No recuerdo anda sobre el sexo, ni siquiera había pensado que no me protegí hasta que Steven planteó la duda. Aparto los pensamientos, no es momento de echar todo a perder. Eso es parte del pasado. -¿Qué pasó con lo de empezar nuestro equipo deportivo? ¿No era por eso que hicimos el amor? –Sip. En verdad mi tono de voz era lastimero. La quería, mejor dicho la necesitaba y no tenía un maldito condón en esta casa. Su risa sonó en medio de nuestro silencio – Eres ridículo mi vida. Y no… No vamos a empezar con nuestro equipo deportivo, no ahora, todavía tenemos cosas que vivir. Yo aun dependo de mis padres… -Pero yo trabajo y nos podríamos casar cuando quieras, te mudarías conmigo o mejor aún buscaremos nuestra propia casa y empezaremos nuestro propio hogar… -¡Josh! - ella me detiene con una gran sonrisa – estas divagando. Yo quiero terminar de estudiar y con un bebe no va a ser fácil. Y no digas que contrataras a alguien porque no comparto la idea de alguien criando a mis hijos. Ellos tienen derecho a tener toda mi atención, además pretendo aportar algo en nuestro matrimonio, no pienso depender de ti – terminó su discurso aun con una sonrisa y no pude evitar abrazarla. Debería sentirme un poco enfadado porque ella no quiera aceptar mi dinero, después de todo no me imagino con nadie más compartiendo mi vida. - Con que… te casarás conmigo ¿eh? – la sola mención de la idea me hacía feliz. La sonrisa de su rostro me complacía aún más, rodo sus ojos mientras negaba con su cabeza. -Mejor vete a conseguir preservativos. Aquí te espero – gemí cuando me di cuenta que no podría convencerla y que la farmacia más cercana estaba a tres calles. Encogí mis hombros y empecé a dirigirme a la puerta. Caminar resultaba complicado, con mi amigo aun emocionado y tratando de escapar de mis pantalones. Solo escuche a Alex reírse por mi forma de caminar. La haría pagar por esto. De alguna manera logre llegar a la farmacia y pedí un paquete de condones. Me gane unas miradas de burla de un par de chicas que seguramente notaron mi estado por mi manera de caminar. Espero que sea por eso y que no hayan notado al pequeño Joshi pidiendo comprensión. Cuando atravesé la puerta mi novia no estaba ni en la sala ni en la cocina. Todo estaba en completo silencio y empecé a sentir miedo de que tal vez ella se fuera dejándome así. Ella es tan cabezota que haría eso. Voy a mi habitación y cuando atravieso la puerta mi boca se seca. Ella siempre me impresiona. Esta ahí con una camisa mía y con sus botas negras de tacón de aguja que llegan a sus rodillas. No lleva nada más, ya que sus pezones aparecen en la tela que los cubren. -¿tratas de matarme? – porque me estaba matando, una muerte dulce. -Si no te gusta puedo irme – su tomo inocente me enciende más. Su cabello suelto me trae, esas piernas torneadas y largas con esas botas y con mi camisa que apenas cubre el inicio de sus muslos me vuelven loco. Avanzo hacia ella que está sentada en el borde de mi cama. Me inclino y sus brazos van a mi encuentro. La beso. Me besa. De alguna manera estoy recostado en mi cama con ella sobre mí. Sus piernas a cada laso. Mis manos viajan de arriba abajo en sus muslos. Sus labios se adueñan de mi cuello y sé que estoy perdido. Nuestra ropa voló por toda la habitación. Exploramos el cuerpo del otro entre besos y risas. Éramos la combinación perfecta. La recosté sobre su espalda, hice mi camino de besos desde su mandíbula a su ombligo. Mi lengua jugó con él para luego seguir mi camino hacia abajo. Pero antes di un mordiscón al pequeño bultito de la cadera de mi novia. Amaba eso de ella, saber que era una persona real que no se obsesionaba con su cuerpo. Ella contuvo el aire cuando recorrí con mi lengua su intimidad. Trato de detenerme pero no se lo permití. Su rostro se tornó rojo por un momento pero cuando el placer la atravesó dejo de resistirse. Mi lengua y mis dedos jugaban con su intimidad llevándola rápidamente al clímax. Cuando su orgasmo llego pude saborear su dulzura. Mientras ella trataba de recuperarse, aun con su respiración agitada la besé. Los besos eran nuestro leguaje, cualquier mensaje podía ser trasmitido cuando nuestros labios luchaban con los del otro. En estos momentos le decía que la amaba, que cada beso, cada caricia, cada pequeño gesto me hacía amarla aún más. -Nunca imagine que harías eso – su respiración aún no se normalizaba completamente. -Mmm pues tengo un gran repertorio – su ceño se frunció y trate de relajar la situación – hay varios libros que comparte ese tipo de información educativa – resalte lo educativo. -Solo espero que no hables de 50 sombras de Grey porque no te dejaré darme latigazos. Mis carcajadas se ahogaron contra la piel de su cuello – Pequeña pinocho, dijiste que solo lo habías leído por la historia de amor. Tranquila, recuerda que estamos aquí para complacernos. Ella también se echó a reír – Pues compláceme. Te quiero dentro de mí. Me cerní sobre ella, me acomodé entre sus piernas listo para fundirme en su cuerpo. Me acerqué para besarla pero ella me detuvo y estiro su brazo hacia la mesita tomando uno de los condones donde los había puesto. La miré insistiendo en que olvide el tema de anticoncepción pero ella solo negó con la cabeza. No tuve más remedio que complacerla y así hicimos el amor. A pesar de que había pasado apenas 1 semana desde nuestra primera vez esta vez incluso fue mejor. Sabía que siempre sería mejor. Holis..! me extrañaron? lo siento si no actualizo seguido pero ando en verdad muy llena en la universidad y los capítulos que debo escribir necesitan mucha concentración ya me entenderán cuando los lean. Prometo los días que tengo de vacaciones por navidad escribir algunos para no hacerles esperar tanto. Gracias por sus mensajes y recomendaciones y la música que han enviado, siganlo haciendo porque mientras mas tenga de donde elegir mejor :P no importa el ritmo, mientras sea mas mejor y si son salsa, merengue, tango lo que sea mejor. Ya entenderán mas adelante en donde entra esta situación. Sigan dejando sus reviews, xfa. cuando un cap no tiene reviews en verdad no me animo a seguir publicando. Animenme. no les toma ni un minuto. y quisiera saber que creen que sucederá, es bueno saber si estoy dejando las pistas suficientes y de paso quizas tenga ideas :P Aquí les dejo un avance interesante ... Nos leemos luego -3 Milet AVANCE: Ira, dolor, celos, rabia, duda, resentimiento. Todos esos sentimientos me atraviesan. Mi cuerpo empieza a temblar. Fernanda nota mi cambio y toma mi celular. - No crees nada de lo que dice aquí ¿verdad? Porque déjame decirte que fueras estúpida si lo haces. Esa chica solo esta dolida. Ella lo quiere y él la rechaza y busca la manera de acabar tu relación. -No sé qué pensar. -No seas tonta. No dudes, Josh no te haría eso. Él te ama, cualquiera puede verlo. -¿Y si es verdad? -¿Dudas que te ama?[Chapter 50] Capítulo 50 - Te Amo – gimió Josh cuando llego a su clímax, cayendo sobre mi cuerpo sin salir de mí. Nuestras respiraciones trataban de normalizarse. Yo besaba la piel de su cuello. Era salado por su sudor pero a la vez era dulce. Salió de mí y con cuidado se quitó el preservativo, luego me acerco a su cuerpo caliente. Yo enredé mis piernas con las suyas. -Parecemos conejos – él se echó a reír y beso mi frente – esto para nada es un día de compras y cine. Supuestamente salimos hoy a comprar unos pequeños recuerdos para que Josh se los lleve a su familia y amigos, pues en 2 días volvía a Los Ángeles. Luego de eso íbamos a ir al cine, pero mientras aparcamos el auto en el estacionamiento oscuro las cosas se calentaron un poco. En realidad fue mucho, porque terminamos saliendo del auto y entrando en el primer hotel que encontramos. Desde que retomamos nuestra vida \"activa\" hace más de 2 semanas no hemos pasado más de un día sin terminar en algún sitio haciendo el amor. -Esa frase se la usa para cuando tiene millón de hijos, y como tú nos has obsequiado una caja de condones dudo que pueda aplicarse con nosotros – Josh siempre \"olvidaba\" el preservativo pero yo siempre lo recordaba, aun no estaba preparada para ser madre – y tú fuiste quien me provocó. -Solo te besé. Y fue apenas un pico. -Eso es suficiente provocación desde mi punto de vista. -Estás loco. -Tú me vuelves loco – y nuevamente se cernió sobre mí. Estábamos listos para otra ronda pero su teléfono sonó. -Contesta Josh – le pedí y sonó más como un gemido mientras sus labios mordisqueaban mi cuello. -Puede esperar. -Contesta. Puede ser importante – lo empuje y el hizo un de esos pucheros patéticos y contesto. -Hola abuela. Espera un momento pongo alta voz – eso hizo y coloco el celular en la mesilla junto a la cama y volvió a acercarse a mí cubriéndonos con las sábanas. Él estaba totalmente debajo repartiendo besos en mi abdomen -Hola Alex – me saludo su abuela – espero no interrumpir nada. -No se preocupe, no ha interrumpido nada. -Oh que bien. Quería saber si puedes venir a merendar hoy? -NO PUEDO – grité. Y Josh rio porque sabía que era su culpa. El mordió el interior de mi muslo izquierdo, de seguro hizo un chupetón. Últimamente me los hacía por todo el cuerpo. – Quiero decir, no puedo hoy abuela. Sip. Abuela. Desde que Josh y yo andamos me pidió que le dijera abuela, ya que no tiene ninguna nieta mujer solo chicos – Tengo una reunión familiar, pero otro día con todo gusto – lo último lo dije con un grito ahogado ya que Josh seguía haciendo de las suyas conmigo. -Basta Josh, deja que tu novia se pueda concentrar. No seas goloso – mis mejillas ardían. Sentía toda mi sangre drenarse a esa zona. No puedo creer que ella suponga que estamos teniendo sexo. Bueno es verdad pero es realmente incómodo. -Tengo que aprovechar el poco tiempo que me queda – el muy descarado salió de debajo de las sábanas con una gran sonrisa mientras contestaba. -No me imagino como serías si vivieras cerca de ella todo el tiempo. -Pues creo que nunca nos verías abuela. La encerraría conmigo todo el tiempo. -Holaaaa, estoy aquí – no sé cómo vería a la abuela de Josh a la cara la próxima vez. -Lo siento Alex. Podría ser mañana. No acepto un NO como respuesta. Quiero una cena con mis nietos antes de que Josh se vaya. -Claro, mañana no tengo problema. -Nos vemos mañana pequeña. Josh llega pronto a casa y deja a tu novia en paz. Soy joven para tener bisnieto – con eso corto y mi vergüenza provoco el sonrojo más grande de la historia. Josh empezó a reírse. -Auch – chillo cuando mi puño golpeo su brazo – no te avergüences mi vida, mi abuela comprende lo que hacemos los jóvenes en estos tiempos. Sabe que no soy chapado a la antigua. -Ni me lo recuerdes, señor yo-follo-en-mi-primera-cita. - Jajajaj pensé que ya habías olvidado esa entrevista. Lo dije porque era verdad, eso hubiera hecho, fui sincero. Si tú me lo hubieras permitido, habríamos acabado así el día que te conocí en Denver. -Antes o después del golpe en mi cabeza? Se ríe y luego pone una expresión como si estuviera pensando –Definitivamente después. Te veías tan sexy con esa mirada de que querías ahorcarme. Y quise devorarme tu boca cuando me insultaste en español. -Nunca cambiarás, debería resignarme. -Me amas así, eso es lo que importa – su mirada se tornó tierna – contigo siempre puedo ser yo mismo. - Si te amo – nos besamos y de pronto necesitaba saber la hora. Tengo que llegar pronto a casa o estaré en medio de un interrogatorio. Estiro mi brazo para tomar el celular de Josh y veo que tiene una foto de nosotros en su fondo de pantalla que rápidamente cambia a una foto mía que no reconozco - ¿Y esta foto? -Oh, bueno es una larga historia- toma su celular y la busca. Me enseña y la puedo ver mejor ahora que no hay letras. Ahí estoy yo cantando con Melissa. Recuerdo que fue la primera noche que regrese de Denver, cuando volví con Darío – Te busque muchas veces en Denver, en serio intente disculparme pero tú ya te habías ido. Cuando te encontré aquí, Connor encontró tu Facebook y vi tus fotos. Vi esta y me sentí decepcionada porque no sabía que cantabas, te quería y no sabía muchas cosas de ti. -Oh – no tenía como responder. -Esa foto me hizo querer conocerte más, claro si tú me perdonabas – le sonreía y el beso mi nariz – quisiera saber que canción cantabas. Busco en mi memoria los recuerdos de esa noche. No puedo evitar recordar sobre Darío pero bloqueo rápidamente esos recuerdos – Bueno es una larga historia. Melissa y yo hemos sido amigas por siempre. Cuando éramos niñas cantamos esa canción en un festival y muchas veces la repetimos aunque no esté de moda. -Podrías cantármela, aunque sea solo una estrofa. – sus ojos son suplicantes. Él se sienta apoyándose en el espaldar de la cama y yo me acomode de espaldas a su pecho y empiezo mi canto. Yo quiero que me quieras como soy yo quiero que me quieras porque si Un palacio en el espacio solo para ti Yo sueño que me sueñas en color Viviendo y desviviéndote por mí para ti todo mi amor To-do mi, Todo mi amor Paulina Rubio (todo mi amor - www_youtube_com/watch?v=P-HKKB3iZRc) - Te quiero tal y como eres – fue todo lo que dijo Josh. Nos vestimos y salimos de ahí. Tuvimos cuidado porque últimamente teníamos reporteros que \"misteriosamente\" se topaban con nosotros. No quería una charla sobre sexo de mis padres. Pueda que tenga 20 años pero para ellos soy su niña. Compramos todo lo que necesitábamos. Por suerte en una sola tienda encontramos toda la variedad de recuerdos que Josh llevaría. Me dejo en mi casa justo a tiempo para bañarme antes de que mis padres y los invitados llegaran. En media cena llego un mensaje a mi celular de Josh, por suerte lo tenía en vibrador. \"Algo que como piedras y vuela\" \"¿o_O?\" \"Un comepiedras volador.. jajaja admítelo siempre te ríes con mis chistes\" \"Deberían prohibirte tratar de hacer chistes. Si te lanzas de comediante perderías la camisa\" \"Ok, necesitaba saber de ti y no sé qué más hacer\" \"Estuvimos juntos hace 3 horas\" \"A mí me parecen 3 años\" \"Exagerado :P \" \"Igual me amas… ¿por qué no estoy invitado a la cena familiar?\" \"Porque es FAMILIAR… te suena\" \"¿Por qué esta Fernanda contigo, si es una cena familiar?\" \"Porque la cena es con la familia de ella. Son negocios.\" \"Baaaah, creo que hablaré con tus papás de negocios, quizás quieran venderte. ¿Cuánto crees que me pidieran por ti?\" \"Me estas tratando como un objeto de nuevo?\" \"Noooo, mi amor. Solo era una broma. No te enojes\" \"Jajajaja Caíste! :D \" \"Eres mala, casi se me para el corazóm . Pensé que te enojaste!\" \"Pues me voy a enojar si no dejas de escribirme. Mi mamá ya me está dando puntapiés por debajo de la mesa\" \"Ok. Solo porque no te quiero enojada. TE AMOOOOO. Nos vemos mañana. Sueña conmigo ;) \" -Tanta dulzura entre ustedes me dará diabetes – Fernanda a mi lado se ríe. Cuando mi celular vuelve a vibrar, señal de que me llego un correo – Dile a Romeo que no es buen momento, tu mamá está a punto de secuestrar tu celular. Mi mamá se vuelve loca con los modales. Por suerte ella se retira al baño y puedo abrir mi correo. Me sorprendo al ver que no es de Josh como yo suponía. \"De: desconocido. Asunto: Saludos. No sé tú, pero yo no pudiera estar con alguien que me engaña. Solo estoy siendo una buena chica y haciendo mi buena acción del día. Josh te engaña conmigo. Cada vez que te deja a ti vuelve a mí y lo disfrutamos en grande. Te usa solo porque vio algo en ti que le gusta, tú sabes cómo son los hombres, pero a quien quiere es a mí. Así que me hicieras un gran favor si dejas de molestarlo. PD: no ha gritado mi nombre mientras te folla? - Shannon\" Ira, dolor, celos, rabia, duda, resentimiento. Todos esos sentimientos me atraviesan. Mi cuerpo empieza a temblar. Fernanda nota mi cambio y toma mi celular. - No crees nada de lo que dice aquí ¿verdad? Porque déjame decirte que fueras estúpida si lo haces. Esa chica solo esta dolida. Ella lo quiere y él la rechaza y busca la manera de acabar tu relación. -No sé qué pensar. -No seas tonta. No dudes, Josh no te haría eso. Él te ama, cualquiera puede verlo. -¿Y si es verdad? -¿Dudas que te ama? -No es eso…- me detengo a pensar de que ella tiene razón. Shannon esta dolida, además Josh nunca me ha dado razones para desconfiar. Solo mis inseguridades están saliendo a flote – tienes razón, solo es difícil ser indiferente cuando estas cosas aparecen. -No quiero imaginar lo que hará Josh cuando lo sepa. -Josh no lo sabrá. No se lo voy a decir ni tu tampoco. Ambas olvidaremos que esto pasó. -Creo que deberías decírselo. -No quiero que sepa que dude de él. Bueno no lo hice pero no quiero llenar de preocupaciones nuestra relación. -¿Y si te sigue molestando? -Si lo hace, le diré a Josh. Por suerte no volví a tener noticias de Shannon. Tampoco le dije a Josh lo del mensaje. Solo me dedique a disfrutar los últimos días con mi novio que pasaron volando. Ahí estábamos, despidiéndonos, esperando que lo llamen para abordar su avión de regreso. Otro tiempo sin él, sin su presencia y sus caricias. No se cómo soportarlo. Anuncian que debe abordar su vuelo y yo me aferro a él con toda mi alma. No puedo evitar llorar. Siempre lo hago, pero el solo saber que estará lejos me rompe. -Tranquila mi amor. Algún día estaremos juntos, nada nos podrá separar. Aunque estemos lejos te llevo en mi corazón, en mis pensamientos. Te amo mucho pequeña. -Ya no puedo estar sin ti. Pero al mismo tiempo sé que estamos haciendo lo correcto, tú amas tu hogar, tu trabajo… -No tanto como te amo a ti. Puedo dejarlo todo por ti, si me lo pides. -No puedo. Quiero ser yo quien de ese pasó. Yo puedo ser médico en cualquier lugar, pero tú perteneces a ese mundo. -¿Harías eso por mí? ¿Dejarías toda aquí solo por mí? – me pregunta esperanzado. -Claro que lo haría, Josh. Te amo, solo te necesito a ti para ser feliz. -Te amo - nos besamos, suave y dulcemente hasta que llamaron de nuevo para que aborde su vuelo. Tomo su maleta y avanzó hacia el túnel de abordaje. Giro antes de ingresar, soltó su maleta y corrió de vuelta hacia mí. Me levanto del piso y me besó con fuerza como si necesitara es beso como si pudiera morir si no lo consigue. -No me importa nada Alex, si somos jóvenes o diferente, nada más importa. Promete que te casarás conmigo cuando regrese. Esta será la última vez que nos separaremos. Quiero una vida contigo, nada me hará cambiar de opinión. Días, meses, años, no me importa, solo quiero compartir mi vida contigo – se arrodilló frente a mí y tomó mi mano donde aún tenía el anillo que me regalo – Te amo Alexandra ¿quieres casarte conmigo? Debería pensarlo, debería analizar mi respuesta pero solo dejo que mi corazón responda – Si Josh. Me casaré contigo. Cuando vuelvas me casaré y me iré contigo. No importa donde mientras este a tu lado. Te amo. La sonrisa más grande se formó en su rostro. Besó mi anillo y luego me cargó y me besó en los labios. Dio giros conmigo en sus brazos y la poca gente que quedaba a nuestro alrededor aplaudió. Cuando la última llamada para abordar sonó. Me pusó sobre mis pies y se despidió con un beso, antes de decirme – Te amo, Alex. Hasta el infinito. -Hasta el infinito – murmuré para mí mismo mientras veía el avión despegar. Había algo en mi pecho que sabía que no iba a estar bien, pero aparte estos sentimientos rápidamente. Hooooola.. ¿Que les pareció? todo va mejor que bien en la historia no creen? Como prometí actualice lo mas pronto que pude :) espero hacerlo pronto.. gracias x sus reviews y comentarios espero q los sigan dejando para mi es muy importante y me motiva seguir :) Espero saber que creen q sucederá...! para mi es importante saber si han captado las pistas q he ido dejando :P Nos leemos muy pronto :P -3 milet AVANCE: -Me sorprendí cuando me enteré. -¿De qué mierda estás hablando, Liam? – me acerque a él con furia. -Cálmate Josh – Jenn me agarro del brazo, creo que temía que golpeara a mi amigo – Explícate Liam, que sabes sobre el tema? intrigadas?[Chapter 51] Capítulo 51 – Te amo Alexandra ¿quieres casarte conmigo? Ninguno de los dos puede soportar esta situación. Nos amamos no tenemos por qué esperar más. Solo necesito su respuesta – Si Josh. Me casaré contigo. Cuando vuelvas me casaré y me iré contigo. No importa donde mientras este a tu lado. Te amo. La sonrisa más grande se formó en mi rostro y mi corazón se salió del pecho solo por la felicidad. Besé su anillo y luego la levante y besé. Giro con ella, sentía como si pudiera volar. La gente a nuestro alrededor aplaudió. Nunca creí que una frase me haría más feliz en la vida. Ella acepto ser mi esposa, no hay manera de que alguien me arrebate este momento. Cuando la última llamada para abordar sonó. Me despedí con un beso, ahora sé que los siguientes besos que nos daremos serán cuando estemos casados, cuando ya nada nos pueda separar– Te amo, Alex. Hasta el infinito. Y así abordé mi avión como el hombre más feliz de este mundo contando los minutos para volver a ella porque mi vida lejos de Alex simplemente estaba vacía. Llegué a casa de mis padres, a diferencia de otras veces no me consumía la tristeza de la distancia. La extraño sí. Mucho, pero la felicidad que me invade es por la certeza que será la última vez que me separe de ella por tanto tiempo. La próxima vez que nos alejemos por cualquier circunstancia, ella tendrá un anillo en su dedo y todo el mundo sabrá que es mía. No habrá forma de separarnos. Le conté a mi mamá sobre mi propuesta de matrimonio, ella en verdad me felicito. Creí que quizás se oponga, no lo sé, celos, inseguridad, cualquier cosa por la que las madres se oponen a que sus hijos se casen; pero no, ella estuvo en verdad feliz por mí y más cuando le dije que Alex no quiere que abandone mi vida, que iría conmigo hasta el fin del mundo. - Es lo que te dije hijo. Cuando hay amor, no es sacrificio lo que hagas para asegurar la felicidad de esa persona; pero aun así siempre que ambas personas den de su parte demuestra la solidez de sus sentimientos. Mi madre siempre fue sabia. Es una mujer luchadora que ha enfrentado mucho y esas experiencias le han servido para guiaros a través de toda la vida. - Josh – de repente su sonrisa se borró y su ceño se tornó serio – el matrimonio es un gran paso, es algo que te marca que te ata a una persona de por vida. No importa si existe el divorcio. El hecho de haber planificado tu futuro con otra persona es una huella que siempre existirá, debes pensar bien, estar seguro… -Estoy seguro de esto – afirmo interrumpiéndola – la amo, no me imagino mi vida con nadie más. -Yo sé que sí…- vacila un poco – lo que quiero decir es que la base de toda relación, todo matrimonio es el amor, el respeto y sobretodo… la confianza – ahora sé a dónde quiere llegar. -Mamá – la miro fijamente – no se lo diré. No voy a arriesgarme, menos ahora cuando tenemos planeado un futuro juntos. Es algo que NO está en discusión. -Si ella se entera cuando estén casados… no quiero ni pensarlo. Los arruinará, y si tienen hijos... -Es por eso que nunca lo sabrá, así no nos afectara – mi voz tiene un toque de rabia. -La verdad siempre se abre camino, tarde o temprano – le doy una mirada dura. No quiero pensar en esa posibilidad. No acepto la idea depender. Mi mamá me deja en paz, pero puedo notar cierto toque de decepción hacia mí. Logré preparar mis cosas para mi próximo viaje. Tengo unas cosas pendientes en Los Ángeles y luego viajaré para las grabaciones de mis escenas en Sinsajo. Prendí mi computador esperando encontrar a mi novia conectada, pero me lleve una gran sorpresa cuando encontré una canción de su parte en mi muro. Yo era el que siempre hacia esto de publicar cosas en redes sociales. Ella siempre pensó que es mejor no darle mucha comidilla a la prensa, por eso me sorprende y al mismo tiempo me provoca una punzada de culpa porque ella se adapta a las circunstancias a pesar de que no le gustan y yo gano de ello, mi popularidad sube. Ahora la prensa estará sobre nosotros, sobre los motivos de que mi novia también comparta sus sentimientos en las redes. La escucho y su letra me hace vibrar. Te extraño pequeño. \"We were made for each other out here forever, I know we were. All I ever wanted was for you to know everything id do, id give my heart and soul. I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah\" ( Fuimos hechos el uno para el otro, aquí para siempre, se lo que somos. Todo lo que siempre quise que supieras fue que lo haría todo, daría mi corazón y mi alma. Me cuesta mucho respirar, necesito tenerte conmigo) (When you're gone – Avril Lavigne: www_youtube_com/watch?v=FD4-nqH0820 ) Esta niña me volvió loco. No sé cómo explicar mi fascinación por ella, la palabra amor no basta. Amo que ella demuestre sus sentimientos al mundo, me hace sentir más importante. Busco rápidamente la canción exacta para la ocasión. De alguna manera el buscar canciones para el otro es nuestra forma de decirnos lo que sentimos sin necesidad de hablar. \"Cuando sonríes, el mundo entero se detiene y se te queda mirando, porque linda, eres asombrosa, Así como eres… ERES LO QUE MAS QUIERO MI PRINCESA\" (Just a way you are – Bruno Mars: www_youtube_com/watch?v=aHvb-j5z_es ) De alguna manera el tiempo pasa más lento que lo normal. Cuento los días, minutos, incluso los segundo para volver a estar con ella. Han pasado 3 semanas y aunque hablamos a diario no compensa el hecho de tenerla entre mis brazos, de besarla, de… hacerla mía. Hasta verla dormir es un total privilegio. Su rostro no es pacífico como el de otras personas cuando duerme. Hasta en eso ella es especial. Su rostro toma diferentes expresiones, su ceño se frunce y se relaja; sus labios se mueven, forman pucheros y sonrisas; es inevitable no probar un poco de esa perfección con mis labios. Siempre termino despertándola. Esa necesidad y dependencia por ella, en lugar de destruirme como una droga, me hace crecer. Desde que la conocí he cambiado. He conocido un mundo nuevo donde el dinero, la fama y todo lo que me rodea no importa. Creí ser parte de ese mundo pero con ella descubrí uno mejor. El pitido de mi celular me despierta. Alcanzo con mi mano el molesto aparato y contesto sin mirar de quien se trata. -¡¿Una Demanda?! ¿Es en serio? – esa voz me resulta chillona y familiar, aunque me provocará una fuerte dolor de cabeza sé que es por una buena causa -¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto, Josh? Te acuestas conmigo, luego me desechas como si no valiera nada y por último pides una orden de alejamiento. -No sé cómo tienes el descaro de llamarme y decirme esas cosas – mi voz era fría aunque tenía todas las ganas de gritarle – no sé qué paso esa noche, pero estoy seguro que estas detrás de lo que pasó. -¿Estas sugiriendo que te drogué o algo parecido? Que poco hombre eres al no aceptar que me deseabas y por eso terminamos haciendo el amor. -No te atrevas a decir eso. Nunca hicimos el amor, tuvimos sexo y no estoy sugiriendo, te lo estoy diciendo, estoy seguro de que me diste algo para hacerme perder la conciencia. Sabías que estaría tan lleno de culpa que no se me pasaría por la mente el hecho de hacerme pruebas de sangre o algo – quería tenerla frente a mí y estrangularla por su cinismo – Mas te vale alejarte de mí si no quieres tener problemas, Shannon. Haz el favor y aprende a valorarte, ten dignidad… -¡No me hables así Josh!, te arrepentirás por tratarme así – y con eso colgó. No pude evitar sentir miedo, temía que ella pudiera hacer algo o peor aún decirle a Alex. Necesitaba comunicarme con Steven. Marqué su número de celular y me envió a buzón. Tal vez estaba en una reunión. Encendí mi computador y le envié un correo electrónico contándole sobre la llamada de Shannon. Podía confiar en que él resuelva todo, además él está muy interesado en que nada de esto se sepa, afectaría mi reputación. Traté de concentrarme en el trabajo pero me resulto muy difícil. Confundí mis líneas y muchas veces tuvieron que sacudirme para llamar mi atención. – Vamos Josh, no sé qué te sucede pero solo haz un esfuerzo más. Terminemos esta escena y concluimos por hoy. Gracias al cielo Francis era una persona comprensiva. Cuando alguno del elenco tenía uno de esos días difíciles el trataba de ponernos las cosas más fáciles. No sé cómo logre terminar la escena y regresé rápidamente a mi camarote. Hice lo único que me podía aliviar en estos momentos. -Hola pequeño – mi novia me saludaba con cariño y solté el aliento que estuve reteniendo. -Hola mi amor – me quede en silencio tratando de tranquilizarme. El alivio me inundaba lentamente. -Mmmmm no quiero decir que no me alegra tu llamada pero ¿a qué se debe? – la verdad es que habíamos acordado solo llamarnos a cierta hora donde no interfiera con nuestras otras actividades. -Solo me desperté extrañándote… mucho – me la imagine sonriendo con mis palabras. -No eres el único que extraña a alguien. -¿Ah sí? ¿Debería ponerme celoso? – mi humor mágicamente cambia cuando hablo con ella. -No lo sé. Puede que sí. – Su voz era juguetona – extraño a mi novio enormemente, cuento cada minuto para verlo ora vez. -Pues yo cuento cada segundo así que te extraño mucho más que tú a mí. -Solo te gusta llevarme la contraria – afirmó - ¿Qué tal la filmación? -Bien, aunque… hoy estuve un poco distraído, pero Francis es genial, así que no me regañó. -Distraído ¿eh? Espero que no trates de echarme la culpa – si supieras… -Pues SI tienes la culpa. No dejo de pensar en tenerte en mi cama… desnuda… gimiendo mi nombre… volviéndote loca con mis besos – empecé a sentir calor con solo imaginármelo. -Por favor dime que no hay nadie a tu lado escuchando – me eché a reír. -¿Solo piensas decirme eso? ¿Qué pasa con mis necesidades?- Esta vez sí estaba necesitado y caliente. -NO vamos a tener sexo telefónico – antes de que sugiera algo ella exclamó – y mucho menos por video chat si es lo que estás pensando. -¿y qué pasa con el pequeño Joshi? Está emocionado tratando de salir – sus carcajadas no se hicieron esperar. -Pues tendrás que contentarle con Manuela, esas dos partes de tu anatomía de seguro que se llevan bien. -Si lo hacen, sobre todo desde que te conocí, mi mano y mi pene se llevan muy bien. -¡Josh! – chilló. - Está bien… el pequeño Joshi y Manuela tendrán un reencuentro memorable. Pero te advierto que estos serán sus últimas escapadas. Cuando te vuelva a ver ellos terminarán con esa relación porque pienso casarme lo más pronto contigo y buscar una manera de que no te alejes de mi por más de 1 km. - ¿Y si tengo que ir a dejar a la escuela a los niños? Tengo que alejarme de ti. -Corrección! Te tendré en mi cama todo el tiempo posible y la única manera de que te alejas de mí por más de un kilómetro es que estés luciendo un gran anillo con mi nombre en él. -¿Me estás tratando como un objeto de tu propiedad? Bien podrías ponerme una placa como a una mascota – esto ya no iba por buen camino. -No te enojes. Solo quiero alejar a todos de ti. Eres mi precioso tesoro, me moriría si te pierdo. -No hables de muerte, sabes lo que pienso sobre ello – si lo sé. Es su mayor miedo. -Lo siento, pero es la verdad. Ahora tú eres mi corazón, si te pierdo me estarían arrancando la vida. Te amo princesa. -Te amo Josh – la dulzura con la que lo dijo derritió mi corazón. Unos golpes en la puerta de mi camarote resonaron. – Vamos atiende antes de que derribe tu puerta. Nos vemos luego pequeño – un beso sonoro se escuchó a través de la línea antes de que la llamada se cortara. No sé porque pero el miedo volvió a mí rápidamente, tenía la sensación de que algo malo pasaría. Los golpes de mi puerta volvieron a sonar y la abrí rápidamente encontrándome con Jennifer. Se abrió paso en mi camarote y avanzo hacia mi cama. Se lanzó sobre ella hasta quedar recostada. Fui tras ella y recogí algunas cosas que estaban tiradas por el suelo. Hoy no había tenido tiempo de arreglar mis aposentos. Sentía su mirada en mí; estudiaba cada momento que daba. -Bien – ella rompió el silencio – Vas a decirme que te pasa. Y no digas que nada porque aunque no te conociera tan bien como lo hago sé que algo sucede. Todo mundo se dio cuenta, así que suelta la sopa. No podía discutir con ella, después de todo era como una hermana así que solo le conté todo. Ella escucho cada palabra que dije sin interrumpirme, solo me dejó desahogarme. - Estas metido en un gran lío – dijo cuando termine – estoy de acuerdo con tu mamá. Debiste ser sincero, decírselo y mucho más cuando estás seguro de que Shannon causó todo. No te niego que es un gran riesgo, pero si en verdad te ama sabrá que dices la verdad. Pero si ella se entera lo que ocultas inmediatamente pensará lo peor y no tendrás manera de defenderte. El que nada debe nada teme. -Para ahora es tarde… -Nunca es tarde, puedes ser honesto y más si quieres una vida feliz con ella. Tienes que liberarte de esa culpa o cada vez que la veas te sentirás más por mentirle, eso en caso de que ella no se entere. La verdad siempre sale a la luz. -Lo mismo dijo mi mamá – le sonreí porque era mi amiga, porque estaba ahí para mí. Le agradecí su comprensión y su cariño. Le prometí pensar en mi siguiente movimiento. Pasaron los días, ya era un mes desde que regresé. Estábamos grabando, cada día era más complicado que el anterior. Era cansado, trabajábamos de sol a sol. Jenn me envidiaba porque luego de terminar estas escenas yo terminaría mi parte y tendría mis merecidas vacaciones, mientras que ella y Liam y gran parte del set tenía aun un par de meses más de grabación, yo solo tendría que regresar para regrabaciones. Es una suerte para mí que no se grabe en orden. El sitio donde nos encontrábamos estaba un poco lejos de la ciudad más cercana. La señal de celular era prácticamente nada, ni se hable de la no existencia de internet. Estaba completamente incomunicado con mi familia y lo más importante con mi novia. He meditado lo que tengo que hacer y aunque tengo miedo debo hacer lo correcto. Le contaré a Alex lo que sucedió. Lo mejor sería que se entere por mi boca para que sepa que soy honesto con ella y que no la engañé. \"El que nada debe, nada teme\" ¿no? Mi novia puede ser cabezota pero tiene un inmenso do de amar a todo el mundo y perdonar, de comprender y entender, y sobre todo de encontrar el lado bueno de todo lo que se le atraviesa en la vida. Espero que ella encuentre el lado positivo de esto porque yo tengo… miedo. -Estoy muerta – Jenn se lanza en mi sofá apenas abrí la puerta – Estas grabaciones ponen a prueba mi resistencia – asiento porque estoy cansado también. Me siento a su lado. Me estiro sobre la mesita de té y no puedo evitar revisar mi celular, sé que la señal es nula pero me siento ansioso por no hablar con mi novia. -Ja eres un posesivo – ella se burla – date por vencido, la señal aquí no permite que viaje ni un mensaje de texto. Dale a tu novia un descanso de ti. Ya debe estar harta. -No me parece gracioso - ella me amaba nunca se cansaría de mí. -No sé cómo un chiste puede producirte tanto dolor – se burló nuevamente – debiste ver tu cara. Anímate, pronto se acabará todo, podrás hablar con ella, luego verla, te casarás con ella, tendrán muchos hijos, luego envejecerán juntos y cuando mueran podrán pedir que entierren sus cadáveres en la misma fosa… -Ya entendí – le dije riéndome – viste mi futuro justamente como lo he planeado. -Ya sabes, soy psíquica. -Sip, tienes algo de bruja – ambos reímos - ¿Por qué tarda tanto Liam? Liam había ido a la ciudad a conseguirnos películas y muchas, muchas golosinas para una noche de relajamiento y ocio. Ya era hora que regrese. Justo en ese momento las ruedas del auto que llevó sonaron. -Hablando del rey de Roma… Fuimos hacia él emocionados por las golosinas. Necesitamos mucho de azúcar mala, esa que te daña los dientes y te hace engordar. Liam nos miró como si estuviéramos locos. Jenn ya tenía la boca llena de nachos. -Por lo menos permitan que la comida llegue dentro – él se burló. Cada uno agarramos varias bolsas y empezamos a llevarlas a mi casa improvisada (era un camión adaptado para que estemos cómodos. Cada uno de los tres tenía el suyo) cuando Liam mencionó algo que me descontroló. -No me habías dicho que ya terminaste con tu novia. Pensé que era la chica de tus sueños. Deje caer las bolsas y gire para enfrentarlo -¡¿QUÉ?! Liam me miró como si me hubiera crecido otra cabeza. No sabía de qué diablos hablaba pero tenía un muy mal presentimiento. -Me sorprendí cuando me enteré. -¿De qué mierda estás hablando, Liam? – me acerque a él con furia. -Cálmate Josh – Jenn me agarro del brazo, creo que temía que golpeara a mi amigo – Explícate Liam, que sabes sobre el tema? -Yo solo… cuando estuve en la ciudad entre en un cafetería y en la TV salió una nota sobre tu ruptura. Todo mundo quiere saber qué paso. Nadie sabe porque terminaron. -Ella y yo no hemos terminado. NO SE QUE MIERDA ME ESTAS DICIENDO. -Yo pensé que no me lo habías dicho porque no tenía importancia o se te olvido. -TODO LO QUE RESPECTA A ELLA ES IMPORTANTE – le grité – voy a averiguar que pasó. Avance hacia el auto. Jenn y Liam metieron las cosas en mi camión, cerraron la puerta y fueron a mi encuentro en el auto. Yo ya hubiera partido si no fuera porque Liam tenía las llaves. Conduje como un loco, por suerte para mí y otros conductores la carretera estaba prácticamente vacía. Mi forma de conducir eres peligrosa pero Liam y Jenn no dijeron nada. En menos de 1 hora estaba en la ciudad. Lo primero que hice fue marcarle a mi novia y no contestó. Mi desesperación creció a un más. Estaba a punto de explotar. Iba a marcar por milésima vez cuando entró una llamada. Solo contesté. -¡¿ALEX?! – mi tono desesperado era evidente. -Soy Steven. He tratado de llamarte ¿puedes decirme que es lo que está pasando con tu novia? -No tengo ni puta idea. No sé porque esos rumores, tú debes estar al día dime lo que sucede. -Bueno tu noviecita te eliminó de Facebook y te dejó de seguir en twitter. Apenas los medios se dieron cuenta supusieron que su relación terminó, ya que ella eliminó toda foto y publicación sobre ustedes dos. La llamé pero no quiere contestarme. -No me contesta a mí. No sé lo que está pasando, Steven. -Te conviene averiguar y arreglar lo que sea lo más pronto posible. Llámame si puedo ayudar. Cortó la llamada y seguí intentando llamarla. No tuve respuesta así que revise mis redes sociales y efectivamente era cierto. No solo me había eliminado de Facebook si no estaba bloqueado, no podía tener acceso a ella. Algo muy malo estaba pasando. Mi miedo más terrible se hizo realidad. Quizás ella se enteró ¿cómo? No lo sé. De pronto las amenazas de Shannon se hicieron presentes así que llame a esa bruja. -¿Qué hiciste? – pregunte en cuento me contesto. -Vaya vaya, si es el nuevo chico soltero. Supongo que es cierto, de no ser así no me llamaras con ese tono de ¿furia? ¿dolor? ¿desesperación? Te dije que pagarías. La vida misma se encarga de hacerte pagar. ¿Por qué no me dices que hiciste? Te aseguro que yo no tengo nada que ver. -No te creo. -Cree lo que quieras. Te dije que te arrepentirías y estoy feliz de no haber movido ni un solo dedo – por alguna razón sé que ella no dijo nada. Luego de cortar con ella marque a alguien que sabría me ayudaría. -No sé qué mierda le hiciste a mi amiga Josh pero más te vale arreglarlo – Fernanda. Acaba de confirmar que está pasando algo grave. Tenía la esperanza de que fuera un error, que ella quería eliminar las redes sociales o alguien jackeo sus cuentas, cualquier cosa. -No sé Fernanda, no sé lo que pasa. Acabo de enterarme que no tengo novia y nadie me dice que mierda sucede. La llamé mil veces y no me contesta. Tienes que decirme lo que sucede. -MI amiga está destrozada. No quiere decirle a nadie lo que sucedió solo no quiere saber nada de ti. Nos pidió que no te nombráramos, que olvidemos todo. Pero es imposible hacerlo viendo lágrimas en su rostro. Se ha encerrado en su habitación, solo sale para clases y no quiere hablar con nadie. Todos estamos preocupados. -Necesito hablar con ella. -¿No me estás escuchando? Ella no quiere hablar con nadie. -Tengo que hacerlo. -Entonces ven y arregla lo que sea que está pasando. -Eso haré. Corte con ella y llamé a Steven. -Necesito un vuelo inmediatamente. Voy a arreglar esto. De alguna manera él consiguió un vuelo para las siguientes 4 horas. Volví a recoger mis cosas y salí inmediatamente hacia el aeropuerto, tendría que viajar a Kentucky por mi pasaporte y luego iría pro ella. Francis me entendió perfectamente. Dijo que no me preocupara, que adelantarían las filmaciones para que las escenas en las que me necesitaba vinieran después de que arregle mis problemas. Gracias al cielo por alguien como él. No quería más problemas en este momento. Tenía miedo, estaba desesperado y mi corazón dolía. Necesitaba encontrar la manera de solucionar lo que sea que está sucediendo. NO, NO, NO, NO PODIA PERDERLA. No ahora cuando ella era todo mi mundo. Hoola a todos... ¿Que tal? ya no los hice esperar tanto.. la verdad es q he podido escribir un poco este feriado..! ¿Que les pareció el capítulo?

Mi alama se rompía y mi corazón se hacía pedazos. Mi pecho dolía y se me hacía difícil respirar. Logre llegar a mi cama y hacerme un ovillo. Quería gritar, quería regresar el tiempo y evitar que ese ser ruin entré en mi vida, quería abofetearme por ser tan estúpida. Quería que el dolor se detuviera. Mi mente colapsó en algún momento. Ya no lloraba, ya no sentía nada. Solo era un cascarón vacío, un desastre que no pensaba y ya no sentía. Solo respiraba porque era algo que no controlaba.[Chapter 52] Capítulo 52 - No sé por qué no se abre mi correo – estaba furiosa, tenía que enviar un trabajo a mi profesor y mi maldito correo no se abría. -Tranquila, ¿segura que ingresaste bien tu clave? – Fernanda al teléfono trataba de tranquilizarme. -Claro que lo ingresé. Esta cosa esta loca. Tal vez Josh cambió la contraseña y olvidó decírmelo. Lo voy a matar, te lo juro. -¿Por qué no creas otro? – me preguntó. -Falta 3 minutos para la hora de entrega, no voy a alcanzar. Maldita sea – de pronto un idea vino a mi cabeza – ya se lo que voy a hacer. Nos vemos luego. -Santiago dijo que a las 8. Tenemos el tiempo justo para llegar a la película. -Ya entendí, bye – corté con ella y rápidamente abrí el correo de Josh. Ambos teníamos las claves de todo lo que corresponde al otro. Adjunte mi trabajo y lo envié. Justo a tiempo, por suerte. Di un suspiro de alivio, era un trabajo muy importante pero como siempre tengo mi mala costumbre de dejar todo para el último. Eliminé el mensaje de su bandeja de salida. Decidí eliminarlo de su papelera, era la primera vez que he usado las claves que me dio. Era una emergencia, pero quería eliminar toda huella de que estuve aquí. Abrí mi mensaje y pulse suprimir, cuando de repente un mensaje apareció frente a mí. Era de Steven y el asunto decía \"URGENTE\". Algo me impulsaba a leerlo, pero no quería invadir su privacidad. Iba a cerrar cuando me pareció haber visto mi nombre. Lo leeré después de todo Josh me dio sus claves, me tiene confianza. Quizás sea algo que ya sé. \"De: Steven A. Para: Joshua H. Asunto: ¡URGENTE! Tranquilo todo está solucionado. Soy un maldito genio. La orden de restricción salió a tu favor. Ella no podrá acercarse a ti ni a tu novia y mucho menos abrir la bocota. Hablé con su agente y está de acuerdo en que no puede decir nada sobre lo que sucedió en ustedes, después de todo Alex y tu son la pareja del momento, todo el mundo sabe cómo se aman y un poco de infidelidad de tu parte dañará tu reputación y la de Shannon se irá a los suelos por ser la intrusa. Todos aman a tu novia. No me lo agradezcas, para eso soy tu agente. Gracias al cielo me llamaste enseguida si no estuvieras metido en un maldito lío. Te imaginas que hubiera pasado si Shannon quedaba embarazada por tu insensatez? Tu popularidad estaría por los suelos y estuvieras en camino de tener un personita que te diga \"papi\". Por suerte tuve la gran idea de comprar una píldora de emergencia. Bueno no voy a recalcar lo obvio. Pero NO puedes decírselo a tu novia, no puedes correr el riesgo de que te deje. Gracias a ella y mis geniales ideas tu popularidad esta por los cielos. Eres un chico talentoso, trabajador, amoroso, tierno y todo eso gracias a que accediste a hacer lo más pública tu relación. Cualquier cosa estamos en contacto, Joshua. Te enviaré los documentos que debes firmar, es el acta de confidencialidad entre Shannon y tu\" Me quede helada. Mi aliento quedo atrapado en mi garganta como un nudo. Trataba de razonar lo que había leído, filtraba la información muy lentamente. Mi cerebro asimilaba, y mi corazón no quería creerlo. La palabra zumbaba en mi mente: TRAICIÓN. Lágrimas empezaron a caer por mis mejillas. El entendimiento llego a mí y me destrozó como un tornado. Tomó todos mis recuerdos, mis sentimientos más puros, los elevó por el cielo y los dejo caer destrozados. Josh se había acostado con Shannon. Me había engañado, ella me lo dijo y yo quise creer en él ciegamente. Me engañó, eso es todo. Solo me usó como entretenimiento, para sexo y resulta también que para elevar su popularidad. El dolor aumentaba mientras el entendimiento se hacía más claro en mi mente. Mi corazón quiso detenerse varias veces. Él me mintió, jugó conmigo. Dijo que me amaba y solo era parte de un maldito plan a su conveniencia y yo como estúpida caí. Todas las señales estuvieron ahí y no quise verlo, debí hacer caso a mis instintos. Sabía que él me haría sufrir, nunca se fijaría en alguien como yo. Llegué a pensar que en verdad me amaba, creí ciegamente en sus palabras, en sus caricias y todo era parte de un maldito plan. Ahora estoy aquí destrozada sin idea de cómo seguir. Tomé una bocanada de aire y sequé mis lágrimas. Aunque era inútil porque seguían viniendo. Leí todos sus mensajes. Eliminados, enviados, recibidos. Tenía que saber todo lo que sucedió. Descubrí que se acostó con Shannon en año nuevo. Me sentí una completa estúpida, yo preocupada por aquel beso que Darío me dio y él revolcándose con otra tipa. Quizás esa no fue la primera vez, quizás me engaño más veces y Shannon ahora dejó de conformarse con lo poco que recibía de él y quería más, por eso la orden de restricción, era un ser ruin que solo le importaba su fama. Ahora comprendo porque la prensa sabía dónde encontrarnos, porque misteriosamente conseguían fotos que solamente las teníamos nosotros. Me sentía usada, me sentía una completa imbécil y más que todo me sentía destrozada. Mi alma se rompía y mi corazón se hacía pedazos. Mi pecho dolía y se me hacía difícil respirar. Logré llegar a mi cama y hacerme un ovillo. Quería gritar, quería regresar el tiempo y evitar que ese ser ruin entré en mi vida, quería abofetearme por ser tan estúpida. Quería que el dolor se detuviera. Mi mente colapsó en algún momento. Ya no lloraba, ya no sentía nada. Solo era un cascarón vacío, un desastre que no pensaba y ya no sentía. Solo respiraba porque era algo que no controlaba. Las llamadas de mis amigos llegaron, aun no quería hablar con nadie. No sé de donde obtuve las fuerzas para enviar un mensaje y decirles que sentía un mal. Después de todo no era una mentira, aunque \"mal\" no definía el hecho de que estuviera hecha pedazos. Las horas avanzaban y daban paso a un nuevo día. El único movimiento que noté fue el de la luna que aparecía fuera de mi ventana. No quería pensar, no quería sentir. Sabía que sería insoportable, la realidad me destruiría y muy probablemente no habría forma de escapar. NO. No podía dejar vencerme. No podía permitir que ese maldito ganara. Tenía que levantarme y seguir. Demostrarle que no me pudo vencer a pesar de todo. Encendí el computador y empecé a borrar cada foto, cada recuerdo que me conectara a él. Dejaría de aprovecharse de mí. Tal vez debería decirle al mundo lo que hizo… pero no me siento capaz, a pesar del dolor aun lo amo. Maldita sea... lo amo. Le iba a dar todo, le entregué mi vida en bandeja de plata y ahora sufro las consecuencias por ser tan ingenua y creer que los cuentos de hadas existen. Ese sería mi secreto, no se lo diré a nadie, yo no era así de ruin para hacer daño otras personas a pesar de que se lo merezcan. Simplemente tendré que avanzar, que seguir. De alguna manera. Pasé esos dos días encerrada en mi habitación. Tenía que pensar en cómo seguir, tenía que crear un estrategia para que mi vida volviera a tener sentido. Las lágrimas regresaron y decidí dejarlas caer, tal vez si lloraba todo lo que podía el dolor disminuyera. Obviamente la noticia de la ruptura viajo rápidamente. Tuve a mis padres preguntándome las razones al día siguiente pero simplemente les dije que todo se acabó y que me duele mucho pero no podía seguir, no quería hablar del porqué. Gracias al cielo ellos lo aceptaron y me apoyaron. Podía notar la preocupación por mí en sus ojos, pero estuvieron ahí sin decir nada más. Las llamadas de Steven tampoco se hicieron esperar. No quería tener nada que ver con ese estúpido que estuvo tras todo este maldito plan. Apagué el maldito teléfono, ya no quería volver a saber de ellos. No quería volver a saber, ni siquiera pensar en Josh Hutcherson. Fernanda me encontró en clases la siguiente semana. Había evitado a todos por varios días, no quería dar explicaciones, no quería que vieran lo acabada que estaba. Prácticamente vivía porque no había forma de morir. Continuaba porque tenía que hacerlo, pero la mayor parte del tiempo era un cascarón vacío hasta que llegaban los recuerdos y las lágrimas hacían su presencia. Ella quería muchas respuestas pero al ver mi estado solo me consoló. Me dijo que todo estaría bien y quería creerle. Realmente necesitaba creer que todo iría bien. Santiago y Darío también estuvieron ahí, sin preguntas ni respuestas. Cuando Darío me abrazaba no podía evitar sentir una punzada de culpa, él me lo había advertido y yo simplemente no quise hacer caso. Quisé cegarme voluntariamente a la realidad. Me levante cada mañana, me vestí, asistí a clases, estudié. No sé si a eso se le pueda llamar vida pero era todo lo que tenía ahora. Salí de mi turno en el hospital y caminé si rumbo con audífonos e mis oídos, pero la música ahora era un simple zumbido que me alejaba del mundo. Me encontré con un bar karaoke y entré. La mayoría eran hombres de más de treinta que me veían como un bicho raro. Me sentía como un bicho raro. Había una idea que me rondaba todo el día. ¿Y si él regresaba? ¿Y si venía a pedirme perdón? ¿Qué iba a hacer? No podía caer de nuevo, sabía que mis sentimientos por él, a pesar de todo, seguían presentes, pero también estaba el dolor, la rabia y… el odio. Alguien me dio un trago, lo tomé de un bocado y casi inmediatamente sentí el mareo de mi cabeza. Le pedí al encargado del karaoke que me pusiera alguna canción sobre desamor, me dijo que hoy era día de rancheras y me sugirió la canción. Conocía la letra así que subí al escenario. Casi caí en el último escalón, el mareo era intenso, quizás se debiera a ese trago, o tal vez a estos días llenos de tensión, de insomnio y lágrimas. Tome el micrófono y los llevé a mis labios. Cuando la canción empezó muchos aplaudieron. Fijé mi mirada en un punto en el escenario hasta que unos ojos hicieron contacto con los míos. Reflejaban dolor, pena, culpa. Parpadeé para asegurarme de que fuera real. Tal vez me estaba volviendo loca. Sacudí mi cabeza y empecé la letra. (El último Adiós – Paulina Rubio: www_youtube_com/watch?v=jNLU_A1d_60 ) Las calles son más grandes desde que tú te has ido hay que reconocer que nada me hace bien porque no puedo verte Mis días sin tus noches sin horas ni minutos son como un frío puñal que hieren y atraviesan, este corazón. Un día mi mundo era perfecto y todo se derrumbó en un segundo. Fijé mi mirada nuevamente en la figura creada por mi imaginación. Era lo que más quería y al mismo tiempo odiaba. Las palabras salieron tan sencillamente, quería que sintiera lo que pensaba, aunque actuar era otra cosa. Por las buenas soy buena, por las malas lo dudo puede perder el alma por tu desamor, pero no la razón Yo soy toda de ley y te amé, te lo juro pero valga decirte que son mi palabras el último adiós, el último adiós. Podía cegarme por todo lo bello que viví con él pero ya no pienso seguir tapando el sol con un dedo. Es un desgraciado y lo sigo amando. Hice contacto visual con mi imaginario Josh que ahora estaba a unos pasos de mí debajo del escenario. Aunque vengas de rodillas y me implores y me pidas aunque vengas y me llores que te absuelva y te perdone Aunque a mí me causes pena he tirado tus cadenas y te dedico esta ranchera por ser el último adiós. NO, no puedo perdonarlo. Ni siquiera sé porque pienso que él tiene la idea de disculparse conmigo. Después de todo esta farsa se acabó, Josh debería sentirse alegre de no tener que fingir más sus sentimientos por mí. Aunque vengas a implorarme a pedirme y a suplicarme aunque vengas y me llores que te absuelva y te perdone Aunque a mí me causes pena hoy yo tiro tus cadenas y te dedico esta ranchera por ser el último adiós. Esos ojos no dejaban de mirarme mientras el público aplaudía. Mi mente en verdad me jugaba una mala pasada. Un tipo se acercó a los pies del escenario y me hizo señas para que saltara. Mi estúpido cerebro aceptó y salté. El extraño detuvo mi caída y sus manos se posaron en mi cintura. -Una niña tan linda como tú no debería sufrir por amor. Ese tipo a quien dedicaste esa canción no merece la pena si te perdió – debía admitir que era guapo, me perdí en sus ojos verdes que me miraban con deseo. Sus manos se posaron peligrosamente en mis caderas - Un clavo saca otro clavo. Si quieres podría ayudarte a ser ese clavo. - Eso no es necesario – esa voz cortó mi respiración, definitivamente estaba al borde de la locura – Quita tus manos de MÍ novia. En ese momento me di cuenta que no era mi imaginación y esto era real. Ira, ira pura atravesaba mis venas. Envolví mis brazos alrededor del cuello del tipo ignorando a Josh – Claro que puedes ser ese clavo, solo tienes que sacarme de aquí. El tipo me sonrió y me atrajo hacia él aún más. Empezó a dirigirme hacia la salida cuando cayó al suelo. Josh le había dado un puñetazo en la mandíbula. Se veía furioso pero mi ira era mayor. -¿Qué mierda te pasa? – le grité. La multitud se acumuló a nuestro alrededor y alguien ayudó a ponerse de pie al tipo. -Le dije que quitara sus sucias manos de ti y no escuchó – gritó dirigiéndose de hacia el tipoel cual ya estaba listo para devolver el golpe pero me interpuse. Le di una mirada y un asentimiento y se calmó. Giré para encontrarme a Josh con sus manos hecho puños y con su mirada llena de dolor y rabia. No sabía que hacer ni que decirle ni mucho menos el porqué estaba aquí. Me abrí paso entre la multitud y salí hacia un frío y lluvioso exterior. Caminé lo más rápido que pude. El cielo reflejaba lo que estaba sintiendo, ocultando las lágrimas y los sollozos que emitía. Seguí por la orilla del río, el camino era difícil. Resbalé en una vereda y raspé mi rodilla. El dolor que sentí no era comparable con el dolor de mi corazón. No tenía la suficiente fuerza para ponerme de pie. Me quede ahí en un charco de lodo llorando. Unos brazos se envolvieron a mí alrededor y de pronto estaba siendo llevada en brazos por Josh. Lo odiaba, pero aun así me aferre a él. Su aroma penetró mi nariz, su tacto nubló mi vista, solo pude pensar en el hecho de que estaba a mi lado. Me llevó bajo el amparo de un árbol, muy pocas gotas se filtraban pero el viento igualmente se filtraba en mis huesos. Se sentó en el suelo con su espalda contra el tronco y yo en su regazo. No podía dejar de llorar. La temperatura de mis lágrimas contrastaba la frialdad de su piel. Empezó a susurrarme muchas palabras, pero mis oídos zumbaban. Solo entendí muchos \"Lo siento\", \"te amo\" pero eran palabras vacías, palabras que ya no creía. Palabras que solo me causaban dolor porque sabía que no significaban nada para él. No entendía cómo podía ser tan ruin como para seguirlas diciendo, ¿quería seguirme usando? ¿le importaba más su fama y popularidad que el hecho que destrozó mi vida? Con toda mi fuerza logré apartarme de él y ponerme de pie de un solo brinco, volví a emprender mi camino bajo la lluvia y el me siguió. -Alex, tienes que escucharme – sonaba desesperado pero ya no confiaba en él – Por favor, no puedes dejarme, necesitas saber, necesitas entender lo que pasó… -¿Qué quieres que entienda? – la furia dentro de mí hablaba – Me engañaste, me usaste solo para aumentar tu fama, me dijiste las palabras que necesitaba oír para utilizarme en tu beneficio. Ya lo entendí, no es necesario que me lo expliques. -No son así las cosas, te juro que no es así – tomó mi brazo para detenerme. Sus ojos suplicantes me miraron. -¿Ah no? ¿no me engañaste? ¿No te acostaste con Shannon? – una parte de mí quería que lo negara, pero sabía que no lo iba a hacer. Cuando no respondió mi corazón se rompió aún más, si eso era posible – Si vez, lo entendí perfectamente. Seguí caminando, no sé como pero mis pies se movían. Me detuve cuando escuche sus próximas palabras – Te amo. Mi furia explotó como un volcán, caminé de regreso hacia él y le di una cachetada. Su cabeza giró hacia un lado y el eco del golpe resonó por encima de la lluvia – No vuelvas a decir eso. Tú no sabes lo que es amar. De alguna manera me sentí mucho mejor luego de decirle eso, así que solté todo lo que sentía - ¿Esa era tu idea? Buscaste a una estúpida para usarla para aumentar tu fama y luego ¿Qué? ¿Me ibas a dejar? ¿Por qué? Porque no te abrí las piernas lo suficientemente rápido que buscaste a otra. Apuesto a que me ibas a terminar pero fui tan estúpida que me acosté contigo y encontraste juguete nuevo – empecé a reírme como loca –y todas esas palabras de \"me quiero casar contigo\" \"quiero una vida juntos\" no puedo creer que me tragué todas esas mentiras. Bien Josh, te mereces un Oscar por tu actuación, caí redondita a tus pies. Su expresión me hizo pensar que en verdad le importaba, pero ya sabía lo buen actor que era. Traté de avanzar nuevamente pero tomó mi brazo – No fue así… no sé qué pasó esa noche. Creo que Shannon me drogó o algo, el licor, las hormonas, maldita se no sé. Pasó y cuando me di cuenta quería morir porque sabría que me dejarías. -Si creíste que te drogó ¿por qué no me lo dijiste? -Si te lo decía, ¿me hubieras creído? – lo medite durante un momento. La verdad es que no se la respuesta. -Tal vez. Quizás me hubiera molestado en ese momento pero el hecho de que me lo hayas dicho hubiera planteado dudas de tu culpabilidad. El que nada debe nada teme. Y tú lo ocultaste porque temías lo que hubiera pasado. -Temía perderte – gritó desesperado. -Pues felicidades. Me perdiste. Hoooolaaa..! Felices fiestas..! lamento actualizar hoy, lo q sucedió es q el 24 se quemó el dispositivos del internet y no me lo arreglaron si no hasta ayer..! ¿Qué les pareció el nuevo capítulo? Ahora ya saben cómo descubrió e engaño de Josh. La canción la puse en último minuto, pues con mis amigos reunidos ayer nos pusimos de Karaoke luego de una presentación de mi mejor amiga y ella cantó esta canción y pensé q era adecuada para una decepción aunque pasada de moda..! Pido disculpas x las faltas de ortografía q cometó sobretodo por las tildes, cuando escribo lo hago rápido y a veces se me pasa y word no lo detecta como falta xq la misma palabra sirve en presente como pasado (donde debe llevar tilde) Espero actualizar lo mas pronto posible y espero ver sus comentarios con lo q creen q pasará, para mi es necesario xq quiero saber si estoy dejando las correspondientes pistas q enlacen la historia :) Gracias x sus reviews y mensajes y espero que los siga dejando, no les toma ni un minuto y me motivo a seguir escribiendo :) nos leemos luego -3 Milet AVANCE: Nadie nunca entendería el dolor que siento. Esa desesperación que me destruye. El amor es tan maravilloso cuando lo tienes a tu alcance pero también es capaz de desvanecerte cuando lo pierdes. Trataba de seguir adelante. En serio lo intentaba, no por mí, si no por otros; por mi madre, mi hermano, toda mi familia, mis amigos. Decepcioné a una persona, no lo volvería a hacer con ellos, no merecían vivir preocupados por mí y mi mundo destrozado. Trataba con todas mis fuerzas, pero mis esfuerzos eran inútiles.[Chapter 53] Capítulo 53 -Pues felicidades. Me perdiste - su tono sarcástico fue como otra bofeteada. Ella seguía caminando y no fui capaz de dejarla ir. No sabía que más decir, no tenía argumentos pero me negaba a perderla. Me duele hacerla sufrir, me duele que sea la razón de sus lágrimas. Soy un canalla, un imbécil, un ser despreciable que hirió a lo que más amaba. Apenas bajé del avión y vine a buscarla. La vi salir de su turno y caminar sin rumbo fijo. No sabía que decirle, como abordarla solamente la seguí. Cuando entró en ese bar y la vi cantar, cada palabra me hizo sentir peor. Porque no era ella la única que sufría, también yo me estaba rompiendo por dentro. Cuando ese tipo la agarro y ella quiso irse con él sentí morir. Ella era mí, siempre sería mía. Me dolió ver que ella defendía a aquel extraño, pero después de todo yo me gané su desprecio. Cada palabra que dijo era verdad. Todo se veía así de ruin, yo era el malo de la película. Todo pudiera explicarse si ella creyera que la amo, para ella solo soy el ser que la usó y lastimo. Nuevamente tropezó pero se puso de pie antes de que yo pueda ayudarla. La lluvia seguía cayendo a cantaros y me di cuenta de que si no hacía algo la perdería para siempre. Corrí hacia ella, me atravesé en su camino. Me lanzo otra mirada llena de ira cuando la tome por sus hombros. -Nunca te mentí sobre mis sentimientos. Lo de hacer nuestra relación publica fue idea de Steven que lamentablemente acepte. Lo de Shannon fue un error algo que no sé cómo diablos sucedió. Pero tienes que entender que lo único cierto es el hecho de que te amo. Te amo con todo mi corazón y no estoy dispuesto a perderte. Estoy dispuesto a luchar hasta conseguir tu perdón. Nunca mentí cuando te dije que eras la única persona para mí, te quiero en mi vida. Para siempre, Alex. Ella quiso apartarse pero la tenía bien sujeta. A pesar de la lluvia pude ver sus lágrimas derramarse. Mi corazón se hacía más pequeño, se rompía en miles de pedacitos. La abracé, la envolví con todo mi cuerpo y aunque ella no respondió a este acto me sentí de cierto modo aliviado de que no me apartara – Te Amo, Alex. Nunca quise hacerte daño. -Lo hiciste… mucho – y con eso destrozó mi alma. Deje caer mis brazos. -Ya no quiero hacerlo – era verdad. Haría lo que fuera por quitar ese dolor. -Pues vete, si de en verdad te importo aunque sea un poco vete y no me busques. Me hace daño tu presencia. Ella empezó a caminar y en un intento desesperado la sujeté y la besé. Ella quiso apartarse al inicio pero se rindió ante mi desesperación. Tenía que aceptar la diferencia. Ya no eran esos besos que me hacían vibrar, que me hacían desatar mi pasión, era el beso en que sabía que todo estaba perdido. Ya no había amor, bueno yo sabía que ella me amaba y yo a ella, pero ya no fue lo que nos trasmitíamos. Yo mostraba mi desesperación ante el peligro de perderla y ella el dolor y la furia que sentía hacia mí. No sabía que más hacer. Afloje mi agarre y ella aprovechó para zafarse. El dolor atravesó mi rostro y luego mi estómago cuando caí de bruces al piso. Ella me había dado un puñetazo y un rodillazo que me dejaron sin aire. Puede verla ahí de pie contemplándome. -Nunca vuelvas a hacer eso, y nunca vuelvas a buscarme, Joshua. Este es el Adiós. Deslizó el anillo que le había regalado y lo dejo caer a mi lado. Ahora si se marchó sin que nada pudiese hacer. La vi desaparecer de mi campo visual sintiéndome inútil por no poder hacer algo. Este era el final de mi historia de amor. Tomé el pequeño objeto de plata entre mis manos. Logré ponerme de pie y enseguida note la sangre que goteaba por mi nariz. De alguna manera llegue a casa de mis abuelos quienes me llevaron al médico. Efectivamente esa chica tenía un puño tan duro que rompió mi nariz. Los medicamentos para el dolor me sumieron en un sueño profundo. Por lo menos ahí estaba lejos de mi triste realidad. Cuando desperté mis abuelos preguntaron lo que me había pasado, lo único que pude responder fue que perdí lo que más quería. Regrese a Kentucky a la casa de mis padres. Nadie hizo preguntas estúpidas sobre qué pasó solo estuvieron ahí para mí. Debieron suponer que mi gran mentira salió a la luz, pero nunca obtuve un \"te lo dije\", solo palabras de apoyo. Me aferre a ese anillo, era mi promesa de una vida juntos, de un amor más grande e infinito que pudiera haber existido. Ahora solo eran recuerdas y promesas que quedaron en el aire. Necesitaba hacer que ella sepa lo que siento, solo había una manera, esperaba que llegue a sus oídos. Publique esta canción, sabría que si el mundo la escucha habría más posibilidades de que ella la escuche. \"Debí haberte aprovechado mientras te tenía\" (The Mess and Made: Parachute www_youtube_com/watch?v=AWlTNXv1cU8 ** ) . De alguna manera regrese a las grabaciones luego de una pequeña cirugía para arreglar mi nariz. No era el mismo, era un simple cascarón pero trate de dar lo mejor de mí en el trabajo. Por lo menos un aspecto de mi vida estaría cubierto. Había hecho un desastre de mi vida, pero no tenía idea de cómo avanzar. Sabía que había perdido, de una manera injusta, pero perdí. De alguna manera los días pasaban pero para mí, solo era un borrón. Me torturaba por ser estúpido y no haber sido sincero. Por las noches me recostaba mirando al techo sin poder hundirme en el sueño hasta muy avanzada la madrugada. Era miserable. Sostenía el pequeño anillo entre mis dedos. Era lo único que me quedaba y nadie podría arrebatármelo. Recuerdos, muchos recuerdo. Eran lo único que me mantenían cuerdo, lo único bueno en mi vida, lo único que me permitía seguir respirando. Estaba harto de todos diciéndome que avanzara, las mentiras de que todo estaría bien. Nada lo estaba y nunca más lo estará mientras no esté ella. Alex. Mi Alex. Mi primer día sin ti – Enanitos verdes: www_youtube_com/watch?v=tnKPeUFjboU \"No estoy acostumbrado a mi primer día sin ti, Que aún digo nosotros cuando estoy pensando en ti.\" Nadie nunca entendería el dolor que siento. Esa desesperación que me destruye. El amor es tan maravilloso cuando lo tienes a tu alcance pero también es capaz de desvanecerte cuando lo pierdes. Trataba de seguir adelante. En serio lo intentaba, no por mí, si no por otros; por mi madre, mi hermano, toda mi familia, mis amigos. Decepcioné a una persona, no lo volvería a hacer con ellos, no merecían vivir preocupados por mí y mi mundo destrozado. Trataba con todas mis fuerzas, pero mis esfuerzos eran inútiles. Muchas veces buscaba la manera de saber de ella, muchas veces me sorprendí marcando su número con la esperanza inútil de que ella me respondiera, pero toda esa ilusión moría cuando sonaba su voz en su buzo de mensaje diciéndome que no se encontraba disponible, que dejara un mensaje si era necesario y ella llamaría luego. Sabía que no lo haría. Ella no me llamaría. Cada vez que sentía que no podía dejar las cosas de esta manera buscaba saber de ella. Ni Fernanda ni Santiago respondían mis llamadas. Solo podía acudir a mi hermano, por lo menos a través de él y las malditas redes sociales podía tener una pista de lo que ocurría con ella. Al parecer había salido adelante. Sin mí. Recuerdos de Amor – Victor y Leo: www_youtube_com/watch?v=hLZJc95GQvE \"Necesito urgente que tú sepas de mis sentimientos, llego a casa no te veo y tengo ganas de salir corriendo. Siento que la soledad y el silencio me abrazan, Mi alegría pasó, solo el recuerdo de amor, no pasa\" Dedicar canciones me hacía sentir… mejor. Ante todo el mundo era un chico enamorado, desesperado por conseguir el perdón de su chica. Nadia sabía la razón, ella no había dicho nada. Sabía que muchos buscaban la respuesta. La atormentaban a ella como lo hacían conmigo. Pero por sus pocas declaraciones solo eran para pedir que la dejaran en paz. Steven me pidió que de jara de hacerlo. Su teoría decía que iba a pasar de ser enamorado a patético. No era bueno para mí y no me importaba. Lo único que me importaba era que ella supiera, de alguna forma, de lo arrepentido que estoy, lo miserable que es mi existencia sin ella. Quiero que sepa que lo amo. Me encerraba en mi habitación casi todo el día. Meditar me hacía bien. Mi familia ya no intentaba sacarme de ahí. Una noche salí y escuche sus voces en la sala, me aproximé. Apenas noté sus siluetas en el sillón cuando la televisión llamó mi atención. La presentadora hablaba sobre todas las teorías que habían ocasionado mi ruptura, entre ellas infidelidad. Mentiras y verdadero cercanas, si tan solo ellos supieran. -Bueno, ninguno de los dos quiere contarnos que sucedió – comentó – esperemos pronto tener a respuesta, pasaron de ser la pareja más enamorada a ser dos chicos con el corazón destrozado. - Josh quiere recuperarla, hemos visto el millón de mensajes que le ha dedicado a través de canciones – comentó la otra presentadora – pero ella se rehúsa. Debió ser algo muy grave para rechazarlo de esa manera. Si te soy sincera extraño a esos dos declarándose su amor, sus fotos, sus canciones y videos. Todo… Eran tan dulces. -Hablando de canciones y videos, tenemos uno de esta chica. Al parecer ella ha entrado en un concurso de bandas en su ciudad. Sabemos lo bien que canta, además gano mucha fama con su romance por lo que tendrá apoyo y una ventaja sobre otro grupos. Este video se filtró de las eliminatorias para el concurso, donde la veremos interpretando una canción de la que estoy segura va con dedicatoria. Veamos a continuación. Empezó el video. Ahí estaba ella, ante su imagen mi corazón salto, sentada en un pequeño banco con un micrófono en su mano. A su lado estaban Diego en un teclado y Darío en una guitarra. Una oleada de furia me atravesó. Era de esperar que esos dos se aprovecharan de que ahora está fuera de juego. Tres jueces estaban a un lado y le dieron la señal para empezar. Su voz… ansiaba tanto escucharla una vez más, pero su canción me llenó aún más de culpa, si eso era posible. Equivocada – Thalía: www_youtube_com/watch?v=kLx-dezVaRk. Sí. Definitivamente era para mí. Me aferré a esa imagen de ella. Triste pero decidida. Si ella aun me amaba buscaría la manera de dejar de hacerlo y superarme. Sabía que lucharía para lograrlo… y la odiaba por ello. Odiaba saber que me olvidaría y yo me quedaría estancado en el dolor de mi pérdida. Cuando mi familia notó mi presencia, la imagen de Alex desapareció de la pantalla dando paso a otra disputa sobre lo sucedido entre las presentadoras. Me encerré de nuevo en mi habitación. Dolía. Dolía mucho ser el culpable de su dolor y l mío. Nos amábamos, nos pertenecíamos. Merecíamos otra oportunidad. Tenía que de alguna manera pedirle que nos la diera. No lo merecía, pero necesitaba hacer el intento. De entre miles de canciones encontré la que necesitaba, con la esperanza de que la escuchara y de que de alguna forma ocurriera un milagro. Arena entre mis dedos – Luis Ernesto Pérez: www_youtube_com/watch?v=7JtYpDdd3T0. \"Y cómo hacer para olvidarte, mariposa sin color. Como olvidar lo que hemos vivido, no lo borra el corazón. Dime cómo hacer para arrancarle las manecillas al reloj, y que este amor no se nos valla como: Arena entre mis dedos\". Quizás si recibí un milagro porque esa misma noche mi celular vibró. Un número del extranjero, no era conocido pero el código si era lo suficientemente familiar para que la esperanza aflore nuevamente mientras presionaba la tecla para contestar. -Alex – un susurro, era todo lo que mi garganta permitía con el nudo que se había formado. -No… soy yo – cada gramo de ilusión se difuminaba al escuchar la voz de Fernanda. Me deja caer en mi cama con la mirada fija al techo. -Dejaste de evitarme? – sonó más como una pregunta que como una afirmación. -Escucha Josh…no sé qué mierda pasó entre mi amiga y tú, no sé qué hiciste o porque todo terminó así pero no llamé para eso. No me reclames el haberte dado la espalda, pero Alex es como mi hermana y siempre estaré de su lado. Debió haber sido muy grave… pero no es por eso que te estoy llamando. -¿entonces qué es? -Ella te necesita. -Yo también la necesito, pero ella no quiere saber nada de mí. Ella dijo que le hacía daño el solo tenerme cerca… ya no quiero herirla. - Lo sé, pero… necesito que traigas tu trasero aquí de inmediato – ella sonó desesperada – ella no puede enfrentar esto sola. Te necesita aunque se niegue. Un miedo enorme me recorrió al pensar que algo malo podría haberle sucedido - ¡¿Qué pasó? ¿Está bien? Dime que tiene! – grité desesperado. - Ella no piensa decírtelo, sé que me matará por esto pero mereces saberlo. Aun no lo confirma pero es lo más probable…- ella se quedó en silencio aumentando mi desesperación. -¡¿QUÉ? ¿QUÉ LE SUCEDE?! Tomo una gran bocanada de aire antes de continuar. Sabía que sus siguientes palabras cambiarían mi vida. - Está embarazada. Hooooolaaaa.. les dejo este capítulo xq saldré todo la semana de viaje asi q no podre actualizar :( q tal ese final? les dejo con la duda ** No encontré el video original con letra pero amo PARACHUTE y si buscan el video verna q Jenn Law aparece en él Gracias por sus mensajes y leer mi historia, disculpen las faltas de ortografía pero no tuve tiempo de revisarlo :P Espero suss comentarios sobre q creen q sucederá? esta vez creo q si les deje intrigados.

Contemplábamos juntos el atardecer. Yo entre sus piernas, refugiada en sus brazos. Me sentía segura. Feliz. Me aferré todo lo que pude a la sensación, sabía que terminaría, debía aprovechar cada instante.[Chapter 54] Capítulo 54 Las últimas tonadas de guitarra sonaron. Ne deje caer sobre el sofá del ático de Diego. En realidad estaba muy, muy cansada. Mi cabeza daba vueltas y mi almuerzo amenazaba con salir. - ¿Estas bien? – Me preguntó Darío sentándose a mi lado – Estás pálida ¿necesitas algo? -No. Estoy bien – puse mi mano sobre la suya para calmarlo. Últimamente tenía muchos mareos. Debía ser el cansancio tanto físico, mental como emocional. -Bebe un poco – Diego me ofreció un vaso con jugo. Era mora. Delicioso – Gracias – le sonreí. -Necesito a mi solista estrella sana. Quiero que mañana estés lúcida. Si pasamos las eliminatorias serás famosa. Había aceptado ser la solista de su grupo para un festival de bandas. Melissa estaba enferma, le quitaron sus amígdalas, ahora necesitaba reposar su voz. Me negué al inicio, no estaba de ánimos, aun no estoy completamente bien, dudo que alguna vez lo estaré; además estaba mi pánico escénico a las multitudes y desconocidos. Fue porque me negué cuando recién inició la banda. Pero Diego necesitaba el dinero del premio. Cualquier suma que pueda ganar en estos momentos ayudaría, pero el premio resolvería todo, juntaría el dinero para la cirugía de su mamá. Ella fue siempre buena conmigo cuando Diego y yo éramos novios; necesita el dinero para la prótesis de su rodilla, la operación y la recuperación. Si yo podía ayudar, por supuesto que ayudaría. - Yo creo que estamos listos, lo mejor será descansar – ofreció Darío. Diego está muy ansioso porque todo debe salir perfecto. Entiendo porque esta tan obsesionado con practicar. - Tranquilo, un ensayo mas no hará ningún mal – me puse de pie de un salto. Mi cabeza dio vueltas y todo se oscureció a mí alrededor. Estaba de regreso en los brazos de Josh. Contemplábamos juntos el atardecer. Yo entre sus piernas, refugiada en sus brazos. Me sentía segura. Feliz. Me aferré todo lo que pude a la sensación, sabía que terminaría, debía aprovechar cada instante. Cuando abrí mis ojos tarde un minuto en reconocer el lugar. Era la habitación de Diego, había estado aquí muchas veces. A un lado estaba Darío acariciando mi mejilla. En su rostro una sonrisa pero en sus ojos preocupación. Diego, Fernanda y los demás chicos e la banda me miraban de la misma forma. -¿Te sientes mejor? – dijo ella acercándose, no sabía a qué hora llegó. Asentí con la cabeza. Me miro con reproche. La semana pasada casi me había desmayado frente a ella. Insistió en ir al médico, pero me rehusé adjudicando al estrés y cansancio - ¿Pueden dejarme sola con ella? Necesitamos hablar. Su voz era seria. Uno por uno abandonó la habitación. Darío cerró la puerta tras él. Fernanda me miró inquisitivamente. - ¿Qué? – le espeté. - ¿Cuándo tuviste tu último período? – me tomó unos segundos entender su pregunta y el porqué de ella. - No estoy embarazada – aseguré enfadada. La verdad no recordaba la fecha con todo lo sucedido. No tenía cabeza para enfocarme en nada más que tratar de reparar mi vida. - ¿Ah no? No puedes estar segura. Ni siquiera recuerdas la fecha de tu maldito periodo. No recuerdo haberte acompañado a comprar tampones o toallas higiénicas últimamente. Has tenido mareos, hiporexia**, y acabas de tener síncope**. Y tampoco es que sigas siendo virgen. - NO… ya no lo soy – dije gruñona. No podía estar embarazada. No ahora – nos cuidamos ¿sí? Usamos preservativos. -Los anticonceptivos pueden fallar, lo sabes. Además, en medio de toda su locura hormonal pudieron descuidarse. Dime que no estás segura que no tuvieron sexo sin protección alguna vez. Dudé. Lo habías hecho. Solo una vez. Era imposible. – No, vale. La primera vez en la playa no nos cuidamos, pero era prácticamente imposible que quedada embarazada. Apenas días atrás había tenido mi período. No eran mis días fértiles. -Y de eso han pasado casi 3 meses. No recuerdas haber tenido tu período luego y tienes los síntomas. Debes aceptar o evidente y planificar lo que vas a hacer. Voy a conseguir una cita con tu ginecóloga – marcó su celular y empezó a hablar. Sus palabras era un zumbido. No podía estar embarazada. No ahora. Él sabría que es suyo y no necesito algo que me até a él. No lo quiero de nuevo en mi vida, y tampoco podía enfrentar algo como esto. Sola. Empecé a sollozar y a hiperventilar. Estaba al borde de un ataque de pánico. Fernanda colgó y trató de tranquilizarme. No podía respirar, me estaba ahogando. Mi mundo está colapsando, incluso aunque me empeñaba en reconstruirlo. De alguna manera logré tranquilizarme. Me enfoqué en cualquier cosa. No podía pensar que estaba embarazada, todo era pura coincidencia. Las eliminatorias del festival me mantuvieron lejos de mis pensamientos. Clasificamos, estábamos dentro de los 32 grupos que actuarían en el festival por un premio de 7000 dólares. En 3 días concursaremos y en 2 sabré que me deparará el futuro. Las malditas 48 horas pasaron lentamente. Ahí estaba yo. Ansiosa esperando mi turno. Fernanda se encontraba a mi lado diciéndome que no todo estaría bien. Nada estaba bien. No me atreví a hacerme una prueba casera. Necesitaba estar segura. Me llamaron, era mi turno. Mis manos sudaban, tropecé varias veces en el camino. Me senté frente a mi ginecóloga. Ella me conocía desde hace mucho, también fue mi profesora en cierta ocasión. -Alexandra, es un gusto verte ¿Qué te trae por aquí? – no sabía que responderle. Ninguna palabra coherente salía de mí. - Quiere saber si está embarazada – Fernanda respondió por mí. La doctora frunció el ceño y luego me miró. Entendimiento y comprensión pasaron por sus ojos. Ella preguntaba y Fernanda respondía por mí. La fecha de mi última menstruación, síntomas… - Bien. Te haremos unos exámenes para confirmar o descartar. Fernanda por favor, ve a caja, paga por esto – le entrego los pedidos de exámenes – sube al departamento de imagenología y habla con la licenciada. Dile que necesito una ecografía de urgencia. Fernanda salió del consultorio dejándome sola con la doctora. Ella se sentó donde mi amiga estaba antes y me abrazó. Me rompí. Necesitaba un abrazo maternal y no podía recurrir a mi madre. No quería decepcionarla. Sollocé en su hombro, me sentía desorientado. - Tranquila, todo estará bien – logre tranquilizarme cuando volvió a hablar – No sé lo que paso con tu novio, pero él tiene que saberlo. Estés o no embarazada no puedes enfrentar esta situación sola. - No puedo decírselo – susurré. - No eres la única que es responsable de ese bebé. Él participó en esto tanto como tú, y aunque estén distanciados por cualquiera que fueran las razones, no puedes negarle el hecho de que podría ser padre. Y tú no debes pasar sola por esto. No te digo que regresen con él, pero tener su apoyo ayudará. Te lo aseguro. Traté de meditar lo que decía pero mis pensamientos eran nublados por la desesperación de no saber qué me iba a suceder. -No quiero meterme en tu vida, Alex. Eres una gran persona. Fuerte. Quizás las cosas que te suceden son solo pruebas. Duras, muchas veces dolorosas, pero te harán más fuerte aun – me ofreció un pañuelo – Ustedes eran una linda pareja. Se amaban, era evidente. Nunca los vi personalmente pero el hecho de poder admirar sus sentimientos a través de una pantalla mostraba lo mucho que se querían… ignoró que sucedió, pero tal vez esta sea una señal o una oportunidad para juntarlos. - No puedo perdonarlo – ella solo me miró y volvió a abrazarme. Cuando volvió Fernanda fuimos directo a mi ecografía y luego me extrajeron sangre. Nos sentamos a la espera de los resultados. - Debes decírselo – soltó mi amiga – él merece saberlo. Estés o no embarazada, Josh debe saber que existe la posibilidad. -No le dirás – le conocía lo suficiente como para saber que ella tenía la intención de abrir su boca si yo no le decía – él perdió ese derecho cuando se acostó con otra. Mi furia fue quien habló. Inmediatamente quise regresar esas palabras a mi boca. No le había dicho a nadie lo que pasó. Ese iba a ser mi secreto. Era lo suficientemente patética, no quería a nadie más siendo parte de mi humillación. -Oh – dijo y me abrazó – lo siento tanto. No sabía, no… ¿estás segura? – le conté todo lo que descubrí y mi último encuentro con Josh. Debo admitir que desahogarme me hizo sentir mejor. - Es un imbécil. Lo voy a matar – antes de que pudiera responder a eso, una enfermera me llamó. - Los resultados ya los tiene la doctora. Está esperando para hablarte de ellos. Me apresuré a regresar al consultorio. Necesitaba terminar con esto de una vez. Me senté en el sillón y esperé ansiosa la respuesta. -No estás embarazada – me tomó una eternidad comprender. El alivio invadió mi cuerpo en oleadas y pude soltar el aire que estaba reteniendo. -¿Está segura? – preguntó Fernanda y la doctora asintió – entonces ¿por qué tiene esos síntomas? - El hemograma** reveló hemoglobina y hematocrito bajo**, también trombocitopenia** lo que explicaría el mareo y el síncope. - ¿Y la amenorrea**? – pregunté. - Sabes que algunas mujeres se les desregula su ciclo cuando tienen sus primeras relaciones sexuales, sumando tu anemia y el estrés que has sufrido no es de dudar que tu sistema colapsó. La ecografía indica ovarios poliquísticos que es la razón que no tengas tu período menstrual. Aún estaba en shock. Después de todo, mi vida no se desmoronó completamente como esperaba. La doctora empezó a recetarme – Bien. Vas a tomar tabletas de hierro y ácido fólico para esa anemia, vitamina K para mejorar tu coagulación. Por favor, aliméntate saludablemente, trata de dejar el estrés y descansa. Necesitas regresar la homeostasia** a tu organismo. Para los quistes en tus ovarios tomarás anticonceptivos, así regularemos tu ciclo y si deseas puedes seguirlos tomando para evitarte estos sustos nuevamente. Eso era innecesario. No corro peligro de embarazarme, no voy acostarme con nadie. Tomé la receta y agradecí a mi ginecóloga. Le debía el alivio que ahora sentía. Fernanda no dijo en el camino a casa. Era lo mejor porque yo tampoco quería hablar. Empezaría a reconstruir mi vida desde aquí. Ya no tengo nada que me ate a Josh más que los recuerdos. Entonces ¿Por qué el alivio no era suficiente para hacerme feliz? ¿Por qué la idea de haber estado embarazada de alguna manera me traía consuelo? Hoooolaaa ¿que tal? les asusté con el anterior capítulo. Aki les dejo el significado de los términos médicos que use... es lo más lógico que usen entre ellos ese lenguaje: Hiporexia: disminución del apetito Síncope: pérdida de la conciencia, lo que decimos desmayo cuando la persona queda inconsiente Hemograma: examen de sangre. Hemoglobina y hematocrito bajo: signos de anemia Trombocitopenia: plaquetas (células que intervienen en coagulación) estan bajas Amenorrea: falta del ciclo menstrual mas claramente el sangrado Homeostasia: sinónimo de equilibrio. les comento que el próximo capítulo tambien será contado desde el punto de vista de Alex. Espero ansiosa sus comentarios sobre que les ha parecido y que creen que suceda luego, creanme que estoy dejando ciertas pistas que más adelante las impresionaran ;) eso espero. Gracias x sus reviews y PM, espero q los sigan dejando, solo les toma un momento :P Nos leemos luego -3 Milet AVANCE: - Alex. ¿Tu última canción fue un mensaje para Josh? – me quede helada. No quería hablara de Josh, no quería saber nada sobre nuestra relación. - No fue un mensaje para nadie. Solo fue una canción. – le espeté furiosa. Odiaba la prensa. Odiaba que quisieran meterse aun en mi vida. -Sabemos que no nos dirás porque terminaron – habló otra entrevistadora - ¿Sabes que mucha de tu popularidad y del apoyo del público se debe a tu relación con él?[Chapter 55] Capítulo 55 - Tranquila, todo irá bien – la sensación de su mano en mi mejilla era mejor que un calmante. - Eso espero. Todo tiene que resultar. - Claro que ganaremos. Somos buenos y tenemos una solista estupenda – le sonreí por el halago. - Hablando de Diego ¿Dónde está? El festival está a punto de empezar. -Lo voy a llamar – se volvió en busca de sus celular y yo intente relajarme. Había mucha gente e iban a escucharme cantar. El complejo tenía a más de 20 mil personas que estarían listos para burlarse si me equivoco. La ansiedad volvió. -Tenemos un problema - dijo Darío y todos nos volvimos para verlo – Hubo un accidente en la carretera a las afueras de la ciudad y bloquearon la vía. Diego quedó atrapado en ese tráfico. Dijo que tratará de llegar por otra vía pero le tomará por lo menos unas 2 horas – me puse nerviosa, porque Diego era el solista principal y yo solo practiqué 3 canciones. No pensaba improvisar. - Si terminamos primeros esta ronda, pasaremos directo a los cuartos de final. Le daremos el tiempo suficiente para que llegue – todos asentimos a la sugerencia de Arturo – Darío, tú inicia y Alex luego. Si ganamos puntos extras por cantar en inglés y desenvolvimiento en el escenario, pasamos. Éramos 32 bandas. Para esta primera ronda dividieron en 4 grupos. Cantaremos 2 canciones cada banda. Los que terminen primeros de cada grupo pasan a ser de los 8 finalistas. Los otros 4 cupos resultaran de las bandas que termine primeros en otra ronda. Los jueces nos calificaran sobre 10. Evaluaran música, la voz, pero también podemos ganar puntos extras por nuestro desenvolvimiento escénico, coreografías, música en otros idiomas, claro si lo hacíamos bien. Planeamos nuestra estrategia, seleccionamos las canciones. Darío iniciaría y luego sería mi turno. Avanzamos al escenario cuando nos llamarón. Había mucha gente. Cada uno tomó su lugar y yo me acerqué a tomar un micrófono, sería la voz de apoyo para Darío. Él se acercó y me ayudo a colocarlo. Estaba tan nerviosa que era inútil con mis manos. -Solo se tu mismas- me susurró – olvídate de esa gente o mejor aún, imagínalos en ropa interior. Sonreí tontamente y me relaje. La canción empezó. No sé cómo él podía improvisar, admiraba su coraje. Las notas de cada instrumento sonaron. Perfecto. Estos chicos eran realmente geniales cuando se trataba de música. La voz de Darío se escuchó en medio de los gritos de la multitud reconociendo el tema musical. Fue una gran idea empezar con aquella canción. (Solo Aquí – Airbag: www_youtube_com/watch?v=GjGXH4XvVOo ) Darío sabe muy bien como impresionar al público. No solo su voz, él tiene carisma y es… sexy. Debo admitirlo, eso fue lo primero que me encantó de él. Su cabellos castaño claro y sus ojos verdes complementan perfectamente a esa blanca piel y sus rasgos delicados. No tiene parecido con sus hermanos. Me miraba. Le sonreí de regreso. No quería pensar que me dedicaba la canción. Mis sentimientos estaban muy escondidos este momento. Las últimas tonadas sonaron y el ritmo cambió drásticamente, dando paso a mi canción. Caminé hacia adelante del escenario tratando de calmar mi ansiedad. Miré a Darío y él me dio un asentimiento para seguir. Ahora él era mi segunda voz. Empecé a cantar (Don't Speak – No Doubt: www_youtube_com/watch?v=5B1bf2Am4qY ) . Gracias al cielo que los micrófonos eran manos libre porque de lo contrario lo hubiera dejado caer de los nervios. Solo canté. Cada segundo se fue haciendo más fácil. No me equivocaría y al parecer le agradaba al público. Quizás era la pasión con lo que lo hacía, el sentimiento de tristeza de esta melodía no tenía que fingirlo porque lo sentía. La letra de mi canción de alguna manera me hirió. No quería pensar en Josh, pero es imposible cuando toda canción me gritaba en la cara algo sobre él. Baje de escenario emocionada por el rugido de aplausos dirigidos a nosotros. A mí. Salté en los brazos de Darío y él me recibió con entusiasmo. Estaba realmente contenta. Esperamos nuestras calificaciones. Fue un total de 35,5. Obtuvimos dos 8, un 9.5, y un nuevo por parte de los cuatro jueces. También nos dieron 1 punto adicional. Estaba segura de que pasamos a cuartos de final, era muy difícil superar esta calificación en una primera ronda. Escuchamos a otras bandas, eran muy buenas competidoras, pero tendremos que encontrar la forma de ganar. Éramos parte de los 8 finalistas. Cuando faltaba poco para nuestro turno Diego llegó. No nos dio tiempo de regañarlo porque tuvimos que subir al escenario. Para los cuartos de final hicieron un sorteo. Formaron parejas y el mejor puntaje de los dos grupos avanza a las semifinales. Nuestra banda rival era buena. Con Darío nos colocamos nuevamente nuestros respectivos micrófonos y él agarró su guitarra. Seríamos las voces de apoyo para Diego. Él era apasionado, es una de las cosas que me había encantado de él. Su canción que había escogido lo demostró. (Volverme a enamorar – Jonathan Luna: www_youtube_com/watch?v=HmEjtwRrCVU ) . Recuerdo que me había dedicado esta canción para pedirme que sea su novia. El público estaba en sus manos. Ellos amaban esa pasión, su energía y su voz. Por ellos su calificación fue 37 y pasamos a las semifinales. Ahora sabía que ganaríamos. Si dábamos todo de nosotros alcanzaríamos nuestra meta. Me preparé para mi siguiente canción. Ya no sentía ansiedad por el público, todo lo contrario, me sentía completa y no perdida como días atrás. Cuando avanzaba al escenario, Darío me intercepto. Todos estaban ubicándose y nos quedamos solos. Nuestras miradas se encontraron, sabía que me besaría. Tal vez debería dar la vuelta a la página y corresponderlo. Pero no pude. Me aparte y subí a ocupar lugar dejándolo ahí. Me concentré en mi canción. Definitivamente esto parecía una gran indirecta. No me importa. Solo la cantaría. (We are never ever getting back together – Taylor Swift: www_youtube_com/watch?v=BKuYCD5Fl-0 ). La canción le encantaría al público. De eso se trataba el festival después de todo, agradar al público. No me debía importar si esto iba a influenciar en la vida de Josh. Ya no debía importarme. Obtuve un 37, nuestro contrincante un 35. Estábamos en la final. Nos darían un tiempo para recuperarnos y cantaríamos la ronda final. Nos llevaron a una sala donde nos entrevistarían para un programa de TV. Este festival era famoso en realidad. De aquí han salido muchas bandas buenas. Además del dinero también nos darían un contrato para diferentes presentaciones durante todo el año. Los entrevistadores empezaron a felicitarnos. Nos dijeron que éramos los favoritos. Eso era bueno. Pero todo se arruinó cuando me preguntaron a mí. - Alex. ¿Tu última canción fue un mensaje para Josh? – me quede helada. No quería hablara de Josh, no quería saber nada sobre nuestra relación. - No fue un mensaje para nadie. Solo fue una canción. – le espeté furiosa. Odiaba la prensa. Odiaba que quisieran meterse aun en mi vida. -Sabemos que no nos dirás porque terminaron – habló otra entrevistadora - ¿Sabes que mucha de tu popularidad y del apoyo del público se debe a tu relación con él? Me quede helada. No lo había pensado y me sentí más furiosa. Josh no debería tener nada que ver con esta parte de mi vida. Yo me había ganado esos aplausos por mi esfuerzo no a costa de su fama. - Puede que la gente me conozca por esa relación, pero estoy segura que el apoyo se debe al buen trabajo que hicimos – mi voz era un poco altanera – Si ganamos lo haremos porque somos buenos – ahora estaba enfadada – Quisiera que dejen de meterse en mi vida. Miles de personas cortan a diario y no tienen a personas indagando en su vida para saber que paso. Ya supérenlo y déjenme en paz. Salí de esa sala furiosa. Estaba harta, realmente cansada de que mi vida sea pública. Estaba cansada de que Josh todavía tenga que ver algo conmigo. Quería superarlo pero no podía si todos los ámbitos de mi vida tenían que relacionarse con él. -¿Estas bien? – la voz de Darío resonó en este pasillo vacío. -Si… lo estoy. Solo un poco enfadada – se acercó y sentó junto a mí. -Tranquila. Les cerraste la boca por completo, dejarán de molestarte – me sonrío – Nada de lo que dijeron es verdad. Josh no tiene nada que ver con tu triunfo. Eso era exactamente lo que quería oír. Lo abrace. Y él me envolvió. Siempre lograba hacerme sentir mejor. Nos separamos cuando todos se nos unieron. Nadie dijo nada sobre la entrevista y agradecí eso. Darío se retiró al baño y nosotros nos colocamos en un lugar cómodo para escuchar. La ronda final empezó. La otra banda sería la primera en participar. Todas eran chicas y eran realmente buenas. -Debemos buscar una canción para ganarles – tiene razón, tenemos que ganar puntos, lo ideal sería un dúo y una canción en ingles nos diera más opción. -¿Y si cantamos Just give me a reason? -Sería genial – Diego casi grita – debemos decirle a Darío, a ustedes les sale perfecta esa canción. -Alto, no se lo digas – me mira con cara intrigado – me refiero a que el dúo lo hagamos tu y yo. -Alex, las notas son muy altas y agudas, yo no puedo cantarlas. -Por favor Diego, no me pongas en esta situación, las cosas con Darío aún son incómodas y cantar juntos quizás sería hacerle entender algo que no es – en verdad es algo que disfrutábamos hacer juntos, cuando cantábamos todo el mundo se desvanecía, solo éramos nosotros. -Ok, es mejor que te prepares ya casi terminan – me dice señalando al escenario. Estoy nerviosa en verdad, es una canción difícil, pero tengo que hacer esto por Diego y su familia, todo debe salir bien, debo concentrarme y olvidarme de mis problemas. -Tranquila Alex, la canción te saldrá perfecta – La voz de Darío me sorprende, él me dedica una sonrisa y yo sonrío en respuesta – me alegra verte sonreír – acaricia mi mejilla – recuerda que siempre estoy junto a ti, nunca lo olvides. -Darío, yo…. -Vamos, es nuestro turno – Diego y los otros chicos empiezan a subir al escenario para nuestra última canción. -Es tu momento Alex, no dejes que él te quite eso – Darío sube los escalones y me ofrece su mano en ayuda. Sé que lo que quiere decir, sé que se refiere a Josh. No puede quitarme esto, porque me quito mucho más. Me robó el corazón. El saber que no estoy embarazada me trajo 2 sentimientos contradictorios, por una parte es un alivio, no me imagino siendo madre aún y mucho menos negarle a mi hijo un padre, si la prueba hubiera dado positiva yo no se lo habría dicho, sé que no puedo perdonarlo aunque sea injusto que mi hijo no tenga padre. Pero al mismo tiempo me llena de tristeza, ese bebé hubiera sido mi propio pedacito de Josh, del amor que yo le di y que él nunca sintió; ahora no tengo nada de él, solo los hermosos recuerdos y la amargura que me rodea. Lágrimas quieren escapar de mis ojos, no puedo llorar aquí enfrente de todos. Camino por el escenario hacia el borde mirando todo el tiempo al piso. Me siento con mis pies flotando en el aire tratando de que las lágrimas no se rieguen. Miro directamente a mis muslos mientras las notas del piano suenan. (Just give me a reason – Pink ft. Nate Ruess: www_youtube_com/watch?v=iwjyIlZSBGg ) Right from the start (desde el principio) You were a thief, you stole my heart (Fuiste un ladrón, robaste mi corazón) And I your willing victim. (Y yo soy tu víctima voluntaria) Como la letra de esta canción: confié en él, le di mi vida y solo fui su víctima, él solo me uso y me traicionó, nunca me amó. I let you see the parts of me (te deje ver las partes de mí) That weren't all that pretty (que no eran tan bonitas) And with every touch You fixed them ( y con cada caricia las arreglabas) Le di todo de mí, le entregue mi vida en bandeja de plata, le di todo lo que soy y él simplemente lo arrojo a la basura. Sigo mirando mis muslos, aun no estoy lista para enfrentarme al público, quizás crean que simplemente es actuación sobre el escenario y no mis sentimientos derramándose como lágrimas. Now you've been talking in your sleep oh oh (ahora estabas hablando mientras dormías) Things you never say to me oh oh (sobre cosas que nunca me dijiste) Tell me that you've had enough (dime que ya te cansaste) Of our love (de nuestro amor) Our love (nuestro amor) Siempre me preguntare que hice mal, él me dijo que me amaba, que yo era su todo; pero la realidad estuvo siempre escondida a mis ojos. Es hora de que siga adelante, sé que no me enamoraré nunca más, porque mi corazón se fue con él y ahora estoy vacía, simplemente vacía. Nunca sabré en que fallé, todo fue tan perfecto, nunca pensé que estábamos mal, pensé que nuestro amor era real. Levanto mi mirada para continuar cantando, miro que él público esta emocionado por la canción. Darío tiene razón, este es mi momento. Just give me a reason (solo dame una razón) Just a little bit's enough (tan solo una es suficiente) Just a second we're not broken just bent (solo un Segundo, no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) It's in the stars (está en las estrellas) It's been written in the scars on our hearts (ha sido escrito en las cicatrices de nuestros corazones) We're not broken just bent (no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) En cuanto escucho la voz de la siguiente estrofa me sorprendo al no escuchar a Diego. Giro mi rostro para encontrarme a Darío cantando viniendo hacia mí. Hecho una mirada fugaz a Diego quien solo se encoge de hombros. En verdad. Lo. Voy. A. Matar. I'm sorry I don't understand (lo siento, no lo entiendo) Where all of this is coming from (de donde viene todo esto) I thought that we were fine (creí que estabamos bien) oh we had everything (lo teníamos todo) Darío está de pie a mi lado cantando, levanto mis piernas y las coloco sobre el escenario. Nuestras miradas se cruzan y la química es innegable cuando cantamos, nos perdemos el uno en el otro, ahora sé que esto dejo de ser sobre Josh, ahora es sobre nuestra historia, sobre Darío y yo… Your head is running wild again (tu cabeza esta imaginando cosas otra vez) My dear we still have everythin' (querida, todavia lo tenemos todo) And It's all in your mind (y todo está en tu mente) Yeah, but this is happenin' (si, pero esto está sucediendo) Él se arrodilla frente a mí, y con su dedo índice me señala y me toca justo por encima de mi corazón. Sus ojos me trasmiten furia, ira, y dolor. You've been havin real bad dreams oh oh (has estado teniendo unos sueños muy raros) You used to lie so close to me oh oh (solías acostarte tan cerca de mí) There's nothing more than empty sheets (no hay nada más que sábanas vacías) Between our love, our love (entre nuestro amor, nuestro amor) Oh, our love, our love... (oh, nuestro amor, nuestro amor) Me ofrece sus manos y en menos de un segundo estoy de pie frente a él. Nuestros dedos enlazados y cantamos el coro sin romper nuestra mirada: Just give me a reason (solo dame una razón) Just a little bit's enough (tan solo una es suficiente) Just a second we're not broken just bent (solo un Segundo, no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) I never stopped (nunca me detuve) You're still written in the scars on my heart (tu segues escrita en las cicatrices de mi corazón You're not broken just bent (no estas rota, solo algo torcida) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) Me alejo de él caminando hacia el extremo del escenario mientras nuestras voces suenan con intensidad, no puedo mirarlo, sé que le hice daño quizás la vida me está regresando lo mismo por hacerlo sufrir, solo puedo mirar al cielo mientras cantamos, siento su voz acercándose a mí: Oh tear ducts and rust (oh los conductos lagrimales se corroen) I'll fiz it for us (yo los arreglaré por nosotros) We're collecting dust (estamos acumulando polvo) But our love's enough (pero nuestro amor es suficiente) You're holding it in (tú lo estas sosteniendo) You're pouring a drink (te estás sirviendo un trago) No nothing is as bad as it seems (no, nada es tan malo como parece) Giro y ahí está, ofreciéndome su mano, pero sé que significa algo más, sus ojos ahora reflejan esperanza. We'll come clean (hablaremos con la verdad) No dudo en tomarla, aunque no lo ame, él siempre estará conmigo. Nos tomamos de la mano y nos juntamos, nuestros cuerpos apenas separados. Moviéndonos al ritmo de la canción. Él me hace girar, bailamos con nuestro canto sin dejar de mirarnos. Inevitablemente ligeras sonrisas aparecieron en nuestras bocas. Just give me a reason (solo dame una razón) Just a little bit's enough (tan solo una es suficiente) Just a second we're not broken just bent (solo un Segundo, no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) It's in the stars (está en las estrellas) It's been written in the scars on our hearts (ha sido escrito en las cicatrices de nuestros corazones) We're not broken just bent (no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) Él me ofrece su brazo y yo me envuelvo en el dando giros, él público aplaude pero no les prestó atención. Este es mi momento, bueno nuestro momento. Just give me a reason (solo dame una razón) Just a little bit's enough (tan solo una es suficiente) Just a second we're not broken just bent (solo un Segundo, no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) It's in the stars (está en las estrellas) It's been written in the scars on our hearts (ha sido escrito en las cicatrices de nuestros corazones) We're not broken just bent (no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) Mis manos se enredan alrededor de su cuello juntándonos y sus manos en mi cintura. Toma una de mis manos mientras canto las últimas estrofas, la besa y la coloca en su corazón, dejando su mano sobre la mía. Oh, we can learn to love again (oh, podemos aprender a amar otra vez) Oh, we can learn to love again (oh, podemos aprender a amar otra vez) That we're not broken just bent (que no estamos rotos, solo algo torcidos) And we can learn to love again (y podemos aprender a amar otra vez) Cuando las últimas notas del piano suenan, él se acerca y besa mi mejilla. No se cómo pude dejarlo de amar. Él es magnífico, y me ama. Ahora que Josh no está quizás pueda remediar mi error, espero que no sea tarde. Merezco una nueva oportunidad para enamorarme. Merezco amar otra vez. HOLLLAAAA... OK EL CAPÍTULO ES MUY MUSICAL, PERO TENÍA Q HACERLO..! Quizas me quieran matar x hacer q Alex piense muy pronto en rehacer su vida pero ya veran el próximo capítulo.. lo que quería logra con ese capítulo es mostrar el enfado de Alex xq las personas crean q solo consigue cosas x haber estado con Josh...!

Nos leemos luego -3 Milet AVANCE: Camino por los pasillos, diviso a mi chica al final de los pasillos. La ira nuevamente quema en mis venas cuando veo a Darío con sus brazos alrededor de su cintura. Los observo por varios minutos hasta que él la abandona para ir en busca de los demás chicos. Alex está sentada en una silla mirando sus manos, cuando camino hacia ella. No se percata de mi presencia hasta que me paro delante de ella y hablo – En verdad te luciste – ella tiembla al reconocer mi voz y cuando levanta su rostro para encontrarme me lanza una mirada llena de odio.[Chapter 56] Capítulo 56 Apenas deje las maletas en casa de mis abuelos y vine al festival. Mi corazón late con fuerza mientras más me acerco a ella. Ahora hay algo que nos ata, será más fácil que ella me perdone si la tengo cerca y si tengo que recurrir a un hijo para recuperarla no me importará, necesito que amé nuevamente. Me pongo una gorra, una bufanda y gafas tratando de que nadie me reconozca, si ella sabe que estoy aquí muy probablemente me evitara. Compro mi entrada y me asombra la cantidad de gente que ha llenado el complejo. Un grupo acaba de terminar la canción y anuncian el último grupo antes de la premiación. Me abro paso entre la multitud tratando de reconocer a alguien que me ayude a encontrarla cuando me toman del brazo bruscamente haciendo me girar: -¿Qué diablos haces aquí, Josh?- es Fernanda, y por su tono me imagino que Alex le conto lo que paso entre nosotros, por suerte no lo hizo antes porque si no yo no me hubiera enterado de lo de mi hijo. -Me imagino que ya lo sabes Fer, pero en verdad no sabes lo arrepentido que estoy, necesito verla, necesito que me perdone y más ahora con…- iba decir lo de mi hijo pero veo a Santiago llegando a nuestro lado – tú me entiendes, yo la amo. -La verdad no entiendo tu manera de amar Josh, yo pensé que eras alguien bueno para ella, y con respecto a lo que hablamos anteayer… es mejor que hables con ella. -Necesito encontrarla…- escucho la voz de ella sonando, giro al escenario. Ahí está la dueña de mi corazón, sentada al filo del escenario cantando, nunca pensé que haría algo como esto, ella tiene miedo escénico, yo sé que siempre canta en karaoke y todo pero solo con personas de confianza y que son pocas no antes multitudes, estoy en verdad orgulloso de ella. Detrás de ella miro que Diego le entrega el micrófono a Darío y una punzada de celos enseguida me ataca. Cuando ellos cantan juntos nace una conexión, los veo y para ellos no hay nadie más en el mundo cuando cantan. No puedo perderla, no ahora, no cuando tengo la oportunidad de recuperarla. Me duele verlos en el escenario, ella le dedica esa mirada tierna que debería ser solo mía, ellos disfrutan en el juntos cantando, la conexión entre ellos es inevitable, se mueven no apartan la mirada y mi sangre hierve de celos. Mis manos se vuelven puños cuando él besa su mejilla. -Después de todo creo que ellos son el uno para el otro – Fernanda y sus comentarios hacen que mi corazón se parta en millones de pedazos. -Pero….. Pero yo la amo, ella es mi vida, no me importa nada, absolutamente nada está bien sin ella a mi lado….- mi voz se quiebra, miro al escenario y los 2 grupos finalistas están en el escenario. Miro a mi niña y la sangre cada vez hierve más en mis venas cuando el brazo de Darío esta sobre sus hombros. No puedo resistirme, ese estúpido aprovecha todas las oportunidades para acercársele. -Bueno ha sido una competencia muy reñida, pero los ganadores de los siete mil dólares y los otros premios es…. La banda número 67 – veo como Alex salta y abraza a Darío, ganaron, ese es el número de su banda, estoy feliz por ellos cantaron fenomenal pero odio verla con otros, odio que él se parte de este momento de felicidad y yo no – Creo que todos están de acuerdo ahora nos dedicaran 2 canciones de despedida. Las otras bandas se retiran y veo como Alex toma el micrófono – Muchas gracias a todos por su apoyo, espero que les guste esta canción – el grito de las multitudes no se hace esperar cuando la canción empieza a sonar: (Ya no quiero – Jesse y Joy www_youtube_com/watch?v=PNNMgzVXUbg ) Una de las cosas que me enamoro de esta chica es la pasión que le pone a todo lo que hace, ver como se iluminan sus ojos cuando su cerebro maquina alguna locura, son esos detalles los que me enamoraron y ahora está cantando y puede que sea presuntuoso pero sé que esa canción va para mí. A pesar de todo ella me ama, y sufre tanto como yo por mis errores. Es algo que nunca me perdonaré. Mi corazón se estremece cuando ella canta sobre quererme olvidar. Es algo que nunca debo permitir que ocurra. Ella termina su canción y rápidamente Diego se acomoda en una silla con su guitarra – Hola a todos nuevamente, esta será nuestra canción de despedida, en verdad agradecemos mucho su apoyo…. Esta canción va para una niña muy especial que se ha metido en mi corazón muy profundamente, no me importa que ella no este conmigo, yo siempre seré feliz mientras ella lo sea, siempre seré su amigo…..como pueden haber notado ella brilla con luz propia – mira a Alex. Mierda! todos quieren aprovecharse de mi metida de pata para conquistarla. (Fantasía – Ariel Cordero: www_youtube_com/watch?v=vZcG93K-078 ) Definitivamente si fuera una chica moriría con esa canción, y eso es lo que más me enfurece, que todo mundo quiera con mi chica. Todo el público se vuelve loco cuando bajan del escenario, la gente empieza a caminar en dirección de las puertas de salida y yo en dirección contraria. Avanzo hasta los camerinos, un guardia me permite entrar luego de revelarle mi identidad y darle un pequeño soborno. Camino por los pasillos, diviso a mi chica al final de los pasillos. La ira nuevamente quema en mis venas cuando veo a Darío con sus brazos alrededor de su cintura. Los observo por varios minutos hasta que él la abandona para ir en busca de los demás chicos. Alex está sentada en una silla mirando sus manos, cuando camino hacia ella. No se percata de mi presencia hasta que me paro delante de ella y hablo – En verdad te luciste – ella tiembla al reconocer mi voz y cuando levanta su rostro para encontrarme me lanza una mirada llena de odio. -¿Qué haces tú aquí, Josh? – mi corazón se detiene al escuchar la rabia en su voz. -Tenemos que hablar mi vida…. - No te atrevas a decirme mi vida – me interrumpe – tu y yo no tenemos nada de qué hablar, pensé que ya todo quedo claro la última vez que nos vimos- ella se levanta para irse pero yo la detengo sujetando su brazo – Suéltame, maldita sea Josh, déjame en paz. - No Alex, tenemos que arreglar las cosas – la tomo por los hombros para que me mire – necesito otra oportunidad, necesito que me perdones. No puedo concebir mi vida sin ti. -Eso debiste pensarlo antes de engañarme, eso es algo que nunca podría olvidar, simplemente….- ella suelta un suspiro – ya no puedo confiar en ti, y si no hay confianza no hay nada. -Por favor, te necesito en mi vida, no me dejes… -Tú fuiste el que lo arruinó todo, maldita sea, no quieras echarme la culpa, dejar todo el peso de nuestra relación sobre mis hombros, asume tu responsabilidad y déjame en paz. -No puedo Alex, entiéndeme, sin ti mi vida no vale nada, tienes que darme la oportunidad… Solo una, prometo no defraudarte. - Solo déjame en paz, vuelve a tu vida, haz como si nunca me conociste, olvídate de mí… -No puedo… -Si puedes, lo hiciste cuando te revolcaste con esa zorra sin recordar que tenías novia, ahí no tuviste problema para olvidarme, ahora lárgate, yo también tengo derecho a ser feliz, no te quiero volver a ver en mi vida – mi corazón se hizo pedacitos ante el desprecio de su voz, me siento mal recurrir a esto, esperaba que ella me diera la oportunidad de enmendarme. -Por nuestro hijo, él o ella merece una familia que se quiera y esté junta – ella se sorprende ante mi mención del bebé. - ¿qué quieres decir con eso? – su voz se torna nerviosa. -Sé que estas embarazada Alex y sé que es mío, cuando hicimos el amor no nos cuidamos y aunque descartamos la posibilidad… es mi hijo. -Voy a matar a Fernanda, lo juro – la tomo del brazo y la jalo hacia una puerta de un armario cuando escuchamos voces venir por el pasillo. -Alex, nuestro hijo merece una oportunidad de una familia feliz, y solo tú puedes darle esa oportunidad si me la das a mí. -Tan solo no puedo permitirte que me hieras de nuevo, no puedo…- su voz tiemble- y no estoy embarazada, solo estoy enferma, ayer me lo confirmó mi ginecóloga así que no puedes agarrarte de eso… No puedo creer que uses ese argumento, nunca pensé que cayeras tan bajo Josh – la miro a los ojos y sé que me está diciendo la verdad, el pequeño rayo de esperanza que existía en mi corazón por ser padre y que ella me perdonara desapareció. -Estoy desesperado, tienes razón no debí usar eso, pero no sabes cómo me siento. -No eres el único que la pasa mal Josh, no eres el centro del mundo – ella camina hacia la puerta. -No soy el centro del mundo, pero tú si eres el centro del mío. -Lástima que esas palabras ya no las pueda creer – la detengo antes de que salga. -¿Ya no me amas? – nos miramos a los ojos, pero ella no me responde y sin poderlo evitar sale hacia el pasillo y desaparece. Trato de retener las lágrimas de frustración que se quieren escapar de mis ojos, trato de que mi corazón siga latiendo porque no quiere seguir adelante. -No sé lo que paso entre ustedes, pero si quieres seguir tratando, hoy iremos a un bar a festejar el triunfo – giro para ver a Santiago detrás de mí – Toma – me entrega una tarjeta – aquí tienes la dirección, pero por favor no digas que yo te la di no quiero que me odie. -Gracias. -No sé si lo mereces, alguna vez te dije que te partiría la cara si la hacías sufrir, pero sé que ella sufre por no tenerte y verte que quieres estar con ella me hace saber que en verdad la quieres… -¿No deberías ayudar a tu hermano? -Mi hermano la ama, pero ella te ama a ti, ante todo está su felicidad, Darío perdió su oportunidad. Él algún día encontrara a alguien y sé que esa persona no es Alex – me da unas palmaditas en mi hombro – Nos vemos en el bar – sigo con mi mirada cuando se marcha por el pasillo, en verdad él es un gran amigo. Acudí a la dirección de la tarjeta. Apenas baje del taxi y note la enorme cola para ingresar en el lugar. La fila no avanzaba y me dirigí adelante donde estaba un guardia cuidando la entrada. El sujeto trato de hacerme retroceder pero rápidamente me reconoció y su semblante cambio. - Señor Hutcherson. Ya no hay lugares disponibles, está completamente lleno. Solo podemos hacer un espacio en la zona VIP. - Lo tomo – dije y me dirigió adentro. Apenas ingrese al pequeño vestíbulo pude ver un escenario para karaoke, mesas dispuestas en alrededor y el bar. Me pareció ver a Santiago ahí y traté de ir hacia ahí pero el guardia me guío hacia un lado donde subí unas escaleras. El segundo piso me otorgaba una vista de todo el primer piso, especialmente el escenario. También había unas pequeñas escaleras que descendían hacia este por si alguien de esta zona participaba en el karaoke. Me ubiqué al borde de la barandilla y rápidamente ubique a Alex. Estaba en una mesa junto a varios de sus amigos. Eran los chicos de la banda. Reconocí a Arturo, Santiago, Fernanda, Diego y… Darío. Mi manos se cerraron en puños cuando vi que junto su frente a la de mi novia. Ese maldito imbécil tenía sus manos sobre ella. Quería golpear su cara y destrozarla por aprovecharse del hecho que no estamos juntos. No podía apartar mi mirada de ellos, me dolía, debería ser yo el que la consuele. Debía ser yo la última persona que le haría daño. Solté el aire que retenía cuando vi a ella apartarse. La vi acercarse a Fernanda y conversar. No sabía qué hacer, no sabía cómo actuar, lo único que no podía era dejar de mirar. Quizás sintió mi mirada pero ella giró y nuestros ojos hicieron contacto. Ninguno apartó la mirada enseguida. Quería trasmitirle lo que sentía pero solo pude sentir su ira y dolor. Se puso de pie. Se acercó al escenario donde habló con el encargado de las canciones. En cuanto terminó de cantar el sujeto que estaba en el escenario ella subió. Me miró, me trasmitió más de su odio. Me miro todo el tiempo durante su canción. ( Échame a mí la culpa – Ricardo Montaner: www_youtube_com/watch?v=Jbkzp7jGgmA ) . Cada palabra me dolía. Me lo merecía. Merecía su desprecio pero no podía hacer lo que me pedía. No podía apartarme. Se bajó de escenario con la cabeza en alto. Sabía que me había hecho daño. Tal vez eso le traería un poco de consuelo pero para mí era cada vez más difícil. Sentía que se volvía inalcanzable. Por la siguiente hora nos dedicamos a encontrarnos con la mirada. Todos sus amigos se habían dado cuenta de mi presencia, pero lo único que me interesaba era poder llegar a ella. La veía hablar con ellos, la veía beber demasiado licor. Vaso tras vaso ella se lo tomaba de un solo trago. Apuesto a que para esta altura debía estar haciendo efecto en su sistema. Ella le quitó a Darío una copa de lo que apuesto es whisky. Tomó el vaso en su mano derecha y la dirigió hacia mí como si brindará y luego lo bebió. Eso me molestó en verdad. Yo estaba aquí preocupado por ella tratando con todas mis fuerzas poder derribar esa muralla que construyó y ella se burlaba de mí. Me puse de pie y baje hacia el escenario. Escogí mi canción y tomé el micrófono para dedicarle cada palabra. Necesitaba encontrar la manera de llegar a ella. La mire y me miró. Le canté. (Imagíname sin ti – Luis Fonsi: www_youtube_com/watch?v=7cwHUKLYqig ) . Me bajé rápidamente y caminé hacia ella. La música empezó a sonar nuevamente en los parlantes dándonos un descanso de las actuaciones. Me paré delante de su mesa. Sus amigos me vieron con furia y enojo, especialmente Fernanda y Darío. - ¿Qué haces aquí? – me preguntó este con furia. Lo ignoré. Ignore a todos. Solo me dirigí a ella. - ¿Quieres bailar conmigo? – le extendía mi mano. Ella la miró dudando en qué hacer. - No va a bailar contigo – resopló Fernanda enojada. Yo solo seguí mirándola. Luego de un momento asintió. Todos nos miraron sin saber que hacer mientras ella se abría paso hacia mí. Tomó mi mano pero las chispas que siempre saltaban cuando nos tocábamos ya no estaban. Nos ubicamos en la pista donde otras parejas bailaban una canción suave que brindaba intimidad. La acerqué a mí tomándola por su cintura, ella solo se dejó conducir pero sus brazos estaban colgados a cada lado. A momentos parecía que iba a perder el equilibrio, definitivamente el alcohol estaba haciendo de las suyas en su sistema. Debía aprovechar la pequeña oportunidad que tenía de estar cerca de ella. Me acerque a su oído y le susurré: – Necesitamos hablar. Hoooola..! hoy me di cuenta q son 6 meses desde q empecé a publicar esta novela... no pensé q haya transcurrido tanto tiempo :P ¿Qué les pareció el reencuentro? muy frío? faltó algo? pues ya verán lo q se viene quiero saber sus comentarios... ¿qué creen q sucederá ahora? El siguiente capítulo es largo y quizás no tenga mucho q ver con lo que les interesa pero mas adelante entenderán q de importancia tiene :) lo verán el miércoles :) Gracias x reviews y Pm xfs no olviden dejarlos, para mí es importante saber q están siguiendo la historia :) Nos leemos luego - 3 MILET AVANCE: -Por favor…. – susurró. Estaba ante mí de rodillas, rogándome una nueva oportunidad, para él, para nosotros. Me pedía confianza, pero yo ya no tenía. -No puedo – lo miré hasta que mis ojos se nublaron por la lágrimas. Me pareció ver que sus ojos también se llenaban de lágrima pero quizás solo fue mi corazón haciéndome ilusionar. No podía dejarlo ganar, ya no quería hacerle caso. La última vez que me deje guiar por el terminé así. -Por favor – me suplico una vez más. Apoyo su frente en mis rodillas mirando hacia el suelo. Tiré de mis manos y él no hizo nada por retenerlas y dejo caer sus brazos a cada lado de su cuerpo.[Chapter 57] Capítulo 57 - Necesitamos hablar – puede que sí, pero no quiero. Sin embargo me dejo arrastrar por Josh. Me lleva atravesando la multitud. Cuando suena un canción. -Espera – tiro de su brazo. Él me mira un poco frustrado – Quiero bailar esto contigo – arrastré las palabras. Definitivamente estoy ebria. Debí notarlo cuando el piso empezó a girar a mis pies al igual que él techo. -Alex… necesito que hablemos – me miró una vez más y se acercó a mí. Puse mis brazos alrededor de su cuello y me pegué a él lo más que pude. Mis labios rozaban su oreja. Sus manos se depositaron en mi cintura. (Dicen – Juan Fernando Velasco: www_youtube_com/watch?v=KcgeV4VHUig ) . Empecé a marcar un ritmo mientras me movía al ritmo de la canción, moviéndome de derecha a izquierda 1..2…1.2…1..2…1.2…. Le canté al oído la letra. Dicen que el tiempo es el mejor remedio para olvidar, dicen que no hay mal que dure cien años y no es verdad, dicen que del odio al amor solamente un paso hay y aunque lo intento mil veces no puedo dejarte de amar Se alejó un poco de mí mientras examinaba mi rostro. Sentí como las lágrimas rodaban por mis mejillas. Ya no me importaba que me viera llorar. Quería que se sienta culpable por lo que me hizo. Necesitaba que sepa lo ruin que es por presentarse otra vez ante mí. Intento, en verdad lo hago, quiero dejarlo de amar y no puedo. Dicen que la distancia es el olvido y a mí me da igual Porque por más que me alejo en mi mente te escondes y Estas (enloqueciéndome) Dicen y dicen frases sin sentido y están tan mal porque no saben porque no han sentido el dolor de amar, cuando no se puede olvidar... Se supone que amar debe ser felicidad no dolor, pero eso es todo lo que siento. Dolor… y un vacío inmenso en mi corazón. Esa letra me estaba haciendo daño. Él debió notarlo porque no me dejó continuar y me llevó fuera del local. Nos alejamos un poco de la entrada. Encontró una banca y me sentó. Ahí caí en cuenta que estábamos en un parque. Podía escuchar a penas el sonido de los grillos y a la vez uno que otro auto pasar. Josh se arrodilló frente a mí y limpió con sus pulgares mis lágrimas. Traté de mantenerme firme, en mirarlo con rabia, pero mi corazón anhelaba su contacto. -Alex… - se pasó la mano por el rostro – No sé qué hacer. No sé de qué otra manera pedirte una nueva oportunidad. Solo sé que no concibo mi vida sin ti… si me das una oportunidad… solo una, prometo hacer todo lo que esté en mis manos, entregaré mi vida a demostrarte lo mucho que te amo… -Tú no me amas – lo corté. Estaba enojada y dolida… y borracha. Tenerlo aquí me lastimaba… me consumía lentamente. -Te amo, te amo mucho…- tomó mis manos entra las suyas y empezó a besarlas – cometí un error, un estúpido error. Me arrepiento, cada segundo desde que sucedió. Pero necesito que confíes en mí y me creas lo que te digo. No sé qué sucedió, creo que fue una trampa, yo… yo nunca te haría eso. Por lo menos no en pleno uso de mis sentidos. Te amo, te amo más a que mi propia vida, Alex. Eres la dueña de mi corazón y mi alma, si tú me dejas… no me queda nada. Quería creerle. Quería creer que cada palabra que me decía era verdad. Pero no podía. Simplemente no podía arriesgarme a que me haga daño nuevamente. Mi corazón nunca volvería hacer el mismo ahora y no soportaría otra decepción. -Por favor…. – susurró. Estaba ante mí de rodillas, rogándome una nueva oportunidad, para él, para nosotros. Me pedía confianza, pero yo ya no tenía. -No puedo – lo miré hasta que mis ojos se nublaron por la lágrimas. Me pareció ver que sus ojos también se llenaban de lágrima pero quizás solo fue mi corazón haciéndome ilusionar. No podía dejarlo ganar, ya no quería hacerle caso. La última vez que me deje guiar por el terminé así. -Por favor – me suplico una vez más. Apoyo su frente en mis rodillas mirando hacia el suelo. Tiré de mis manos y él no hizo nada por retenerlas y dejo caer sus brazos a cada lado de su cuerpo. Nos quedamos en esa posición. Yo sentada llorando y él con su cabeza en mi regazo. Pasaron minutos o quizás horas, no estoy segura. Pero esta cercanía a cada instante era más insoportable. El licor dejó de hacer efecto. Mi cabeza estaba lúcida, podía pensar mejor. Venir con él fue una mala idea definitivamente. Trate de ponerme de pie y Josh se estremeció. Mientras el trataba de levantarse yo ya estaba por lo menos 10 pasos lejos de él. Empecé a correr, no soportaba estar ahí con él. Mi ser entraba en conflicto, mi corazón rogaba por él y mi mente quería apartarlo, no podía controlar lo que me sucedía y tenía miedo de explotar. Él me alcanzo apenas salí del parque y me empujó contra una pared. Traté de zafarme pero su cuerpo me aprisionó – Déjame ir – mi voz era un susurro. Su cercanía me afectaba, no me permitía pensar. -¿Ya no me amas? – otra vez la maldita pregunta. No podía entender que si fuera así de fácil dejarlo de amar pudiera echarlo de mi vida fácilmente – Dímelo… si ya no me amas no tengo razón para estar aquí. Mi vida basta con verte feliz así no sea conmigo. Pero si amas no me pidas que deje de insistir, no concibo mi vida sin ti, eres mi vida, mi todo…. Mi hogar. Y con esas palabras mi corazón se hizo pequeñito. La intensidad de su mirada me hizo dudar. Yo lo amaba, tal vez lo que sucedió era como él lo dijo. Una trampa. Josh sí me amaba, si nos daba una oportunidad él lucharía por mí y todo volverá a su lugar. \"No seas tonta\" me gritó mi mente. Y si todo era otra de sus mentiras? Y si solo quería seguirme usando? No sabía que pensar. Solo pude perderme en su mirada esperando por una señal para saber qué hacer. Hacer lo correcto, para mí… para todos. Sus ojos no me dejaron cuando su mano acarició mi mejilla y lentamente se deslizó hacia la parte posterior de mi cuello. Me iba a besar. Si lo hacía estaba perdida. Perdería todos mis argumentos porque él me poseería. Mi cuerpo, mi alma y mi corazón lo anhelaban; si obtenían un poco de él no se conformarían, lo tomarían todo. Sus labios apenas rozaron los míos cuando un estridente sonido me trajo a la realidad. Aparté a Josh rápidamente y busque mi celular que estaba guardado en mi bota. Josh maldijo por lo bajo mientras yo me fijaba en la pantalla para ver quién era. Me sorprendí mucho al ver la foto de Peter en la pantalla. -Peter, Hola – salude. -Alex… - su voz se quebró y escuche sollozos al otro lado de la línea. -¿Qué pasa Peter? – Josh se sorprendió de mi angustia y se acercó a mí. -Mi mamá está mal – sollozó nuevamente. -¿Qué sucedió? – Kristin era como otra madre para mí – Peter, por favor dime que está pasando. - Mi mamá se puso mal. La encontré desmayada y la traje al hospital. El doctor dice que es grave – su voz se quebró – ella quiere verte, Alex. Necesitas venir lo más pronto posible, antes de que… muera. Me quedé helada. No quería que Kristin muriera. Esto no estaba pasando, era una pesadilla. Mi cuerpo se tensó y mi respiración quedó atrapada. Empecé a sollozar, mi pecho se sacudía, pensé que golpearía el piso pero unos brazos me acunaron. Vi a Josh tomar mi celular y hablar pero no entendí lo que dijo. Me abrazó mientras sollozaba y me susurró palabras tranquilizadoras al oído. Recuperé mi voz – Llévame con ella. Él asintió. Tomamos un taxi a mi casa. En el camino llamé a mis padres y les expliqué la situación. Me dieron su permiso para hacer este viaje, ellos sabían lo importante que era Kristin para mí, y lamentaron no poderme acompañar. Una hora después estaba en carretera abierta hacia la capital. Josh consiguió 2 boletos de avión apenas llegáramos allí. No hablamos en el camino pero estaba muy agradecida por su ayuda. No podía entender porque sucedían cosas malas a las buenas personas. Kristin vivía más de 20 años con diabetes e hipertensión arterial. Ella era fiel a su tratamiento, no puedo entender porque de pronto está grave. Mi mente entra un estado entre el sueño y la vigilia sin llegar a los extremos durante el viaje. Mi cabeza dolía quizás por el licor, quizás por el hecho que he llorado mucho o tal vez solo porque ya no soporta más aflicciones. Gracias a Peter y sus abogados no tuve problemas para salir del país. La última vez que viaje fue gracias a un permiso como estudiante, ahora era un permiso especial. Estaba sentada junto a la ventanilla del avión cuando Josh se sentó a mi lado ofreciéndome una bebida. La rechacé, no tenía estómago que resistiera alimentos. -Debes comer, Alex. Sé que en estos momentos es lo que menos te interesa pero es necesario. Por favor – me ofreció nuevamente el vaso humeante – Necesitas estar fuerte… por ti… por Peter. La tomé porque tenía razón, necesitaba tener energía para lo que vendría. Josh me dio una media sonrisa cuando le regresé el vaso vacío. Traté de acomodarme para dormir pero luego de una hora de intentos sabía que había fallado miserablemente. Josh lo notó e hizo algo que me recordó que lo de Kristin no era mi único problema. Levanto el brazo del asiento y me acuno en sus brazos. Dejé que ese abrazo me relajará, no quería pensar en nuestros problemas, había cosas más importantes que eso. Mi cuerpo reconoció su cercanía inmediatamente y se relajó. Noté el cansancio acumulado y mis defensas cayeron como siempre lo hacen cuando Josh está a mi lado. Sollocé en su pecho. El dejó desahogarme. Escucho cada palabra, cada lamento, cada maldita idea que salía de mi boca sobre Kristin. La injusticia divina de que una persona una buena tengo un final triste y temprano. - Tú siempre dices que las cosas suceden por alguna razón… Todo estará bien. Sucederá lo que tenga que suceder y será porque Dios, el destino, lo que sea lo quiso así. Solo tienes que ser fuerte ante las adversidades, por ti, por todos – sabía que lo que decía era verdad. Por lo menos no trato de decirme palabras estúpidas de que todo se arreglaría. Todo lo contrario, cada palabra que pronunció era verdad y sabría que tendría que ser fuerte. Pero no podía enfrentar esto sola, necesitaba de alguien… lo necesitaba a él. -Quédate conmigo – hundí mi rostro en el agujero de su cuello – no me dejes pasar por esto sola. -No lo haría – besó mi frente – nunca te dejaría sola. No mientras tú no me alejes… y aun así lucharía contra ello. No dijo más y yo no respondí. Solo me deje consolar por sus brazos y así pude caer rendida en los brazos de Morfeo. Llegamos a una clínica en Los Ángeles. Kristin había estado en un viaje de negocios cuando se puso mal. Josh me llevó a su departamento, no me negué porque no sabía a donde ir y no quería atormentar a Peter con ese problema. Luego de un baño partimos Cerrar los ojos no ayuda. El miedo arde más brillante en la oscuridad. Cuando llegamos ahí vi rostros conocidos. Familia de Kristin. No les agradaba mi presencia así que solo me limité a saludarlos. -Alex, llegaste – Peter se apresuró a mí y me abrazó. Me aferré a él y ambos sollozamos. Él era mi hermano, necesitaba de mi apoyo. -¿cómo está? – le pregunté cuando nos sentamos en la sala de espera. -El médico trato de explicarme. Dice que su corazón está fallando y que sus riñones también están afectados por la diabetes lo que complica todo. Por favor habla con él, tú lo entenderás de mejor manera. -Iré a hablar con él – le aseguré - ¿Y Pool y Loise? – me inquietó no encontrarlos, eran los único de la familia de Kristin a quien agradaba. -Se fueron de misioneros a Sudáfrica y no he podido localizarlos – me explicó – me sentía solo. No sabía que hacer… gracias por venir. - Siempre estaré aquí para apoyarte hermano. No estás solo, además tu familia también está aquí – incline mi cabeza señalando al grupo de personas que me nos observaban con mala voluntad unos pasos más allá. -Son unos hipócritas. Solo está aquí porque esperan que mi mamá les herede su dinero. La única verdadera familia que tengo son Pool, Loise y tú. Lo abracé. Sé que el dolor que siento no se compara al que él siente pero no lo dejaría nunca solo. Nos separamos cuando Josh apareció con el médico tratante de Kristin. - Me pidieron que le explicara el estado de la paciente – miró a Josh y luego a mí. - Necesito saber a qué grado está su cuadro. Ella se estaba siendo rigurosa con el tratamiento, incluso su presión arterial no subía de 120/80 hasta lo que yo recuerdo. ¿Tiene refracción al tratamiento? – hable un poco en término médico para que entendiera mi nivel de conocimiento. Se me hacía más fácil escuchar la explicación desde el punto de vista médico y no una explicación para familiares. - Ha entrado en grado de insuficiencia cardiaca global. Estamos hablando de un grado cuatro. La enfermedad progresó tan rápido debido a la afectación renal por la diabetes. Llegó un grave edema agudo de pulmón. El sincope posiblemente se debió a la hipoxemia cerebral. Tiene ortopnea y la administración de oxígeno no está resultando eficientemente. Tiene refracción a digitales, estamos administrando dobutamina y dopamina ¿sabes lo que significa? – asentí – con su permiso debo retirarme. En un momento de lucidez me pidió que Peter y Alexandra entren a verlo. He pedido a la enfermera que les permita entrar, ella los llamará cuando Kristin esté despierta. Vi como el médico desaparecía por el pasillo. En pocas palabras Kristin estaba en el grado más crítico de su enfermedad. Su riñón falló e hizo que se acumulara líquido haciendo que su corazón se sobrecargue de trabajo y se acumulara líquido en sus pulmones. No podía respirar y el oxígeno no mejoraba el cuadro. Los fármacos de primera elección ya no funcionaban, estaban usando medicamentos betaadrenérgicos que eran la última opción. En cuanto su corazón ya no responda a ellos… Kristin morirá y no habrá nada que podamos hacer. Traté de explicarle a Peter lo que sucedía. No quería hacerlo pero él me pidió que sea sincera. Cuando nos llamó la enfermera ambos nos preparamos para lo peor. Josh tomó mi mano y beso mi frente susurrándome \"Se Fuerte\". Estaba agradecida con él por estar aquí. Entramos en la sala de cuidados intensivos. Ambos ahogamos un sollozó cuando vimos el estado de Kristin. Podíamos ver el esfuerzo que hacía al respirar. Su cuerpo estaba hinchado por la retención de líquidos y su piel era pálida y fría. -Hijos…- su voz era un susurró y le costaba mucho esfuerzo emitirla. Sin poder evitarlo, lágrimas se derramaron por mis mejillas. -No te esfuerces mamá – le dijo Peter acunando su mano. -Mi hora a llegado… lo siento. Pronto veré a tu padre y a mi pequeña… quiero que sigan adelante. Tienes que ser fuerte hijo, ser siempre la persona que eres. No te dejes vencer – inevitablemente Peter también empezó a llorar. -Alex… - su mirada hizo conexión con la mía – eres muy linda niña, una linda persona… lucha por lo que quieres… - asentí – Te considero otra hija… no dejes sola a mi hijo. -No lo haré. Es mi hermano como tú eres otra madre – ella sonrío. - Me alegra que sea así. Espero que aceptes lo que tu madre te quiere dar – no entendí lo que se refería, iba a preguntárselo cuando ella continuo – Antes de irme quiero darles mi bendición… hijo, te amo, me hiciste muy feliz y estoy orgullosa de ser la madre de una persona tan valiosa. A cada uno nos dio la bendición y un último beso. Ambos sabían que sería la última vez que veríamos a Kristin. Ella se despidió de nosotros y nosotros de ella. Esa noche ella falleció. Su corazón solo resistió lo suficiente para darnos su último mensaje. Amanecimos esperando poder retirar su cuerpo. Gracias al cielo Josh se encargó de buscar esos papeles y a los médicos para firmar porque Peter y yo estábamos aturdidos por el dolor de la pérdida y la \"supuesta familia\" de Kristin también nos acompañaba en el dolor. Los servicios fúnebres empezaron al siguiente día. La velaría ese día y mañana, luego la cremarían. No nos separamos de su ataúd en ningún momento. Pasamos noche y día en el salón donde se velaba su cuerpo. Josh no se apartó de mi lado. Estuvo ahí murmurándome palabras de resignación. Fue mi roca, también para Peter. Gracias al Cielo Pool y Loise llegaron. No sé cómo los localizaron pero fueron de gran ayuda. Eran las únicas personas que entendían lo que sentíamos. Luego de la ceremonia religiosa se llevaron el cuerpo y fue cuando la realidad nos golpeó más duro. Nunca volveríamos a verla. Me aferré a Josh y sus brazos estuvieron ahí para mí. No sé cuántas lágrimas el secó de mis mejillas, no sé cuantas palabras de consuelo me susurró pero para mí bastaba el hecho de que no se separará de mi lado en todos estos días. No quería pensar en lo que esto significaba, no era momento de analizar nuestra situación. Toda la gente empezó a retirarse cuando nos entregaron la pequeña hurna de plata con sus cenizas. Peter haría que las coloquen junto con las de su padre y su hermana. -Es hora de irnos - me susurró mi hermano – Vamos al departamento. Me di cuenta de que Pool y Loise también irían, además de toda su familia. No quería causar inconvenientes ni incomodidades. Prefería irme a un hotel por lo menos no me encontraría con personas que no me querían ahí. -No te preocupes, tu apartamento debe estar lleno – con mi cabeza apunte a su familia. -Haremos lugar, no te preocupes – me miró esperanzado. Josh debió entender mi dilema porque intervino. - Tranquilo Peter, ella se va conmigo a mi departamento. Ahí están sus cosas y estará más cómoda – Peter me miró interrogante. Él debía saber que ya no estábamos juntos. - Iré con él – lo tranquilice. -Mañana se dará la lectura al testamento de mi madre. Tienes que estar presente – de su traje sacó un tarjeta. – Tienes que estar ahí a las 11 am. Josh encárgate de que llegué. -No entiendo – dije. -Mi mamá te incluyo en su testamento – pude observar cómo algunas personas giraron a vernos cuando Peter dijo esto. -No necesito nada – susurré. -Ella no merece nada, solo es una oportunista. No tiene derecho. – dijo una mujer. Era una hermana de Kristin. -Cállense – gritó Peter – No ofendan a mi hermana. Ustedes son los que no tienen derecho a nada. Nunca estuvieron ahí para mi mamá. No quiero escuchar ningún comentario más. Todos quedaron en silencio. Peter me abrazó y yo le susurré un \"gracias\". Josh me sacó de allí y me llevo a su departamento. Me senté en el sofá y él fue a prepararme un té. El cansancio pudo conmigo y apenas me sentí cómoda caí dormida. Hooooola de nuevo :) aki esta el capítulo, un poco largo, pero creo q no necesitaba detallar mas. Espero q no les haya aburrido toda la terminología médica, trate de explicarles lo mejor que pude para q entendieran lo q sucede. Quizás soy cruel por matar a Kristin pero me entenderán xq lo hice. Les cuento q estoy en exámenes finales, y solo tengo 2 caps mas escritos, espero tener tiempo de escribir un poco luego del viernes (es el examen mas importante) para poder actualizar el domingo, de otro modo lo haré el próximo miércoles :) espero me comprendan he estado muy estresada x los exámenes y sin inspiración, quede estancada en un capítulo :/ Lo bueno es q si todo sale bien con la universidad tendré unas buenas vacaciones en las q pienso adelantar todo lo q puedo (espero poder terminarlo aunq x un lado extrañaré mucho la historia) para no tenerlas esperando mucho ;) Gracias x sus mensajes y reviews, para mí es muy importante saber lo q piensan. sigan dejándolos xfa :P Perdonen faltas ortográficas, nunca tengo tiempo de revisarlas y el capítulo siempre terminó publicándolo como lo escribí, si encuentran alguna no duden en avisarme para poder corregirlo en mi archivo. BLARALU: Me emocioné mucho leyendo tu review, no te preocupes no dejaré la historia inconclusa. me prometí no hacerlo y suspendí las otras ideas q tenía hasta terminar con esta.

Espero q te haya gustado el capítulo. Nos leemos luego -3 MILET AVANCE: - ¿En qué piensas? – pregunté. Ella giró y me enfrentó. - Todo es muy surrealista, no parece real. No sé qué pasará mañana. Alcancé su mejilla con mi mano y ella no se alejó – Todo parece un sueño. Últimamente no hubiera imaginado tenerte así nuevamente.[Chapter 58] Capítulo 58 La veía dormir en el sofá. Me senté frente a ella en mi pequeña mesita. Solo quería contemplarla, era la encarnación de un ángel. No me atrevía a tocarla. Se veía tan frágil, tan delicada, tan lejos de mí. Podía estar a menos de un metro de mí pero la verdad era que ahora estaba en un sitio inalcanzable. Antes a pesar de la distancia que nos separaba su corazón, su alma siempre estaban a mi lado. Me dolía verla sufrir. Dolía. Mucho. Y no podía hacer nada para evitarlo. Sus rizos se esparcían como una cortina. Me acerqué a ella y coloqué aquellos rebeldes que caían sobre su rostro detrás de su oreja. Decidí tomarla entre mis brazos y la llevé a mi habitación. Era la más cómoda y tenía una vista hermosa. Esperaba que ella se fijara en ello. La coloqué en mi cama y le quité sus zapatos. Quería retirarle esa ropa molesta pero no me atreví a invadir su privacidad. Sé que es estúpido, la había visto mil veces desnuda pero no creía que era correcto ahora. No merecía ese derecho. La metí bajo mis sábanas y la arropé con las cobijas. Ella se revolvió un poco y abrió sus párpados somnolientos. -Shhhh – le susurré – Tranquila. Solo recogeré unas cosas y me iré a la otra habitación. Descansa. Di la vuelta en busca de mi pijama cuando su mano sujetó mi brazo – No me dejes sola, por favor. Quédate conmigo, Josh. -¿Estás segura? – me arrodillé para quedar a nivel de su rostro. Quería que su respuesta sea afirmativa. Tener la oportunidad de dormir con ella nuevamente era un regalo del que estaría eternamente agradecido, pero al mismo tiempo no quería incomodarla. No tenía derecho a causarle más daño. - Si no lo estuviera, no te lo pediría - un toque de sarcasmo. Decidí obviarlo y aproveché la oportunidad. - Solo me cambiaré – me acerqué a mi armario y tomé una sudadera que es con lo que normalmente dormía - ¿No te importa que duerma solo con esto? Ella me sonrío. – No me importa si a ti no te importa que me quite esta ropa. Recordé que ella se sofoca por la noche por lo que su ropa siempre era ligera – Claro que no – le lancé mi sudadera y decidí que lo mejor sería dormir solo con mis boxers. De pronto sentí mucho calor. Me quité mis zapatos, mis calcetines y el resto de la ropa. Cuando giré tuve que reprimir un gemido. Pude ver como abría el broche de su sujetador, se lo quitó lanzándolo al montón de mi ropa que había dejado en el piso. Aunque solo vi la piel de su espalda no podía evitar reaccionar de esta manera. Sabía lo que se sentía esa piel bajo mis dedos. Se quitó sus pantalones y rápidamente se colocó mi sudadera. Tuve que girar y meterme al baño. Definitivamente una ducha de agua fría ayudó pero desconfiaba de la reacción de mi cuerpo cuando la tuviera cerca. Cuando volví a mi habitación ella estaba nuevamente recostada, mirando hacia la ventana. Era una muy bonita noche, a pesar de la luz de la gran ciudad podíamos ver la gran luna que adornaba el cielo. Me acerqué lentamente y me metí bajo las cobijas. Estábamos cerca, sentía el calor que su cuerpo irradiaba pero a mi parecer está demasiado lejos. - ¿En qué piensas? – pregunté. Ella giró y me enfrentó. - Todo es muy surrealista, no parece real... No sé qué pasará mañana. Alcancé su mejilla con mi mano y ella no se alejó – Todo parece un sueño. Últimamente no hubiera imaginado tenerte así nuevamente. Temí dañar el momento cuando las palabras escaparon. Pero ella no se apartó a pesar de ello – No quiero hablar de nosotros, Josh. - Yo necesito que lo hagamos. - No esta noche, por favor. No quiero pensar en ello. Solo necesito que alguien me abracé. - Puedo hacer eso – le respondí divertido y ella me compensó con una sonrisa. Se colocó de espaldas a mí. Me apegué a ella. Alargué mi brazo para que ella apoye su cabeza y mi otra mano se envolvió en su cintura. Me sentía como en un sueño. Ya no estaba en esa maldita pesadilla, ahora la tenía a mi lado nuevamente. No pude evitar sonreír. Era raro hacerlo luego de tanto tiempo. - Gracias… - ella rompió el silencio – no solo por abrazarme esta noche. Gracias por acompañarte estos días… sé que no estamos bien pero nunca olvidaré lo que hiciste por mí. - No tienes que agradecer. Tú sabes porque lo hice. – quería que ella reconozca mis sentimientos, quizás de esa forma vería lo mucho que la amaba. - La verdad es que ahora no lo sé. Mejor dicho no sé qué creer… no hablemos de ello ahora ¿sí? - ¿Cuándo querrás escucharme? –Mi tono era un poco furioso – lo siento, no quiero abrumarte, pero entiende mi desesperación. - Mañana. Cuando volvamos de la lectura del testamento. - Esta bien – otra vez silencio – Gracias por permitirme abrazarte. No eras la única que necesitaba esto - Ella giró y quedamos de frente. Nuestros alientos se mezclaban. Si quería podía besarla, nada me lo impedía – Te necesito tanto, Alex. Te… Ella puso un dedo sobre mis labios – No lo digas… por favor. - Necesito que lo sepas. Nunca lo he dejado de hacer y nunca dejaré de hacerlo… dijiste que no sabes o no me crees porque no me quiero separar de tu lado, pero si escuchas las palabras mil veces quizás pueda convencerte de que es cierto – tomé aire antes de continuar – te... Me silenció pero esta vez con sus labios. Al inicio me tomó por sorpresa pero mi cuerpo y mi corazón respondieron casi de inmediato. Necesitaba tanto esta sensación, necesitaba demasiado sentirme completo nuevamente. Como un deshidratado o hambriento, este beso me volvió a la vida. Me hizo consciente de cada célula de mi cuerpo. No me había dado cuenta en verdad el grado en que la añoraba, era mucho más de lo que creía. Apenas era un roce de labios, solo ternura nada pasional. Solo delicadeza y amor. Cuando ella se alejó volvía sentir ese vacío. Abrí mis ojos y me encontré con los de ella. – Tienes razón, no hace falta que te diga mis sentimientos, tengo que demostrártelos. Alex solo me abrazó y se acurrucó a mi lado. Levanté su mentón solo para un beso más, otro sencillo roce de labios que me acompañará en mis sueños. Me aferré a ella como si mi vida dependiera de ello y la verdad es que lo hacía, sin ella no tenía vida. Caí en un sueño profundo, algo que no había hecho en mucho tiempo. Me desperté cuando la luz se filtraba en mis párpados. Pensé que había sido un sueño pero sentir su cuerpo contra el mío me trajo una esperanza a que esta pesadilla en la que vivía terminará. Con mucho esfuerzo me alejé de ella. Salí de la habitación sin antes depositar un beso en su frente. Fui en busca de comida, con el viaje mi despensa estaba vacía. Quería prepararle un desayuno delicioso. No podía evitar sentirme emocionado, esto era lo que he querido desde que la conocí: despertar a su lado en mi cama, desayunar juntos, todas las cosas que hace una pareja que ha unido su vida para siempre. Cuando entré por la puerta a mi departamento me encontré con ella usando mi portátil en el mesón de mi cocina. Me detuve un momento para admirar su belleza. Su cabello despeinado y esas piernas torneadas que me volvían loco. Sin duda mi ropa lucía mejor en ella que en mí. Cuando notó mi presencia cerró la página en la que navegaba inmediatamente dando paso a mi fondo de pantalla, una foto de ambos en la boda de su hermano. Alguien tomó esa foto mientras ambos sosteníamos la mirada encerrándonos en nuestra burbuja. Amaba esa foto. Ambos miramos la pantalla por unos instantes hasta que ella cerró la tapa del computador. - Lamento haberlo tomado sin tu permiso, necesitaba revisar unas cosas. - No te preocupes – respondí dejando las cosas sobre el mesón - ¿Qué deseas desayunar? Hoy seré tu chef personal. - La verdad es que no tengo hambre. - Nada de eso señorita – me paré frente a ella – Nos has comido bien últimamente, no acepto un no por respuesta o me veré obligado a darte de comer en la boca como a una niña pequeña. Ella me sonrío y mi corazón casi sale de mi pecho – Vale. No discutiré más, no quiero que me traten como una niña pequeña, ya soy una mujer. - Una muy bella – no pude evitar recorrer con mi mirada todo su cuerpo una vez más y ella se sonrojó. - Voy a arreglarme. Tomaré una ducha si no te importa. - Adelante, mi casa es tuya. Pero aún no has dicho que te apetece. - Sorpréndeme – me dijo dirigiéndose a mi habitación. Pude tener una vista completa del balanceo de sus caderas y su hermoso trasero. Tranquilo pequeño Joshi, debes calmarte. Respira, respira. Cuando regresó pudimos desayunar juntos. Aunque solo se escuchaba el sonido de los cubiertos chocando con la vajilla, me sentía en cierto modo satisfecho. Amaba tenerla en mi cocina. Ella se ofreció a limpiar todo mientras me cambiaba de ropa. Por suerte el lugar donde nos citó Peter estaba solo a unas calles. Llegamos al sitió acordado y Peter ya estaba ahí. Saludo a Alex y a mí. Nos presentó al abogado que daría lectura al testamento. Pasamos a la oficina y empezó. La familia de Peter resultó ser multimillonaria. Tenían residencias por todo el mundo y una empresa de inversiones que daba estupendas regalías. Me di cuenta que ellos no vivían según sus ganancias. Recuerdo su casa en Denver era lo suficientemente cómoda, para nada ostentosa. Todas las propiedades quedaron a nombre de Peter ya que estaban a nombre de ambos padres. En cuanto hablaban de la empresa, Peter había heredado el 40% de las acciones de su papá, Kristin era dueña del otro 40% y lo repartió entre Peter y Alex. El otro 20% de las acciones pertenecía al hermano de Kristin, Pool. Alex era millonaria ahora. A pesar de que solo era un 20%, las regalías eran extraordinarias, no tendría que preocuparse por el dinero nunca más en su vida ni en la de su descendencia. - No puedo aceptarlo, Peter. Ese dinero es tuyo. - Nada de eso, mi mamá no quería que te preocuparas por el dinero, quería que sigas estudiando. Además serías de gran apoyo para mí en la empresa. Cumplirías el papel que quieras. - Yo no sé nada de negocios. - Puede contratar un abogado para que administré su parte – sugirió el licenciado. - No será necesario. Confío en Peter, sé que el podrá administrar todo como ha venido haciéndolo. - Si deseas puedes contratar ese abogado – respondió Peter – no me molestaré por ello. - Nada de eso hermano, confío en ti. Y ya se en lo que quiero intervenir. No lo haré ahora pero voy a informarme, quiero impulsar el área social en las empresas que invirtamos, claro si eso es factible. - Sabía que serías de gran apoyo – Peter abrazó a Alex – Bienvenida a la empresa socia. - Solo necesitamos que firmen estos papeles e iniciaré el trámite de transferencia de acciones a su nombre, señorita. Me informó Peter que usted no vive aquí. Hasta cuando permanecerá en el país, si requiere podré apresurar los trámites. - Mi vuelo sale mañana a las 11am, compré hoy el boleto de avión en línea. Si tengo que firmar podría regresar o puede enviarme los documentos. No es necesario apresurar las cosas por mí. Eso me dolió. El hecho de que ella planee dejarme, sin siquiera habérmelo contado. Sé que no tengo derecho, ella puede hacer lo que quiera con su vida, pero no se detuvo ni un instante en pensar en lo que siento. - Yo tengo que viajar hoy a Boston, se presentaron unos pequeños inconvenientes allá. - Entonces debemos despedirnos. Pero seguiremos en contacto socio. Acordaron enviarle los oficios necesarios a Alex cuando estuvieran listos. Se despidieron del licenciado y luego entre ellos. Alex murmuró palabras de apoyo y Peter también. Organizaron maneras de pasar juntos vacaciones y luego se despidieron con un gran abrazo y unas cuantas lágrimas. Volvimos a mi departamento, no hablé en todo el camino. Me sentía herido. - ¿Te vas mañana? – el dolor de mi voz era evidente. - Así es – susurró sentándose en uno de los sofás en mi sala. Nos quedamos en silencio por otro largo momento – ¿No te importa si hago la cena yo? - Claro que no – no podía seguirle mirando – Iré a tomar un baño y descansar. - Vale, te llamo cuando este todo listo. Tomé un baño y me dejé caer en mi cama. Escuchaba como se movía en mi cocina, había puesto música en mi estéreo y la tarareaba. No sabía que iba a hacer, no quería que se vaya, no podía perderla. Pero ella no tenía problema con irse y olvidarme. Eso dolía. Estuve recostado hasta que me llamó para cenar. Lo hicimos en silencio y luego ambos limpiamos todo. Era hora de hablar. Hooola como están? actualice, se q un poco tarde pero lo hice... ¿qué les pareció? y lo mas importante ¿qué creen q sucederá a partir de ahora? Les cuento que sigo estancada en un mismo capítulo. no me gusto mucho como quedó, esperaba que fuera de otra manera pero no se q me sucede, creo q ando sin inspiración pero con todo espero q les guste :) Me han preguntado xq hice todo un enredo con lo del posible embarazo de Alex y xq lo descarté. la verdad es q ese capítulo tuvo ciertas pistas muy importantes q lo entenderán mas adelante.. No solo lo hice x llamar la atención. Sigo en exámenes quizás sea eso lo que me mantiene bloqueada pero creo q los capítulo estan entendibles...! Gracias x sus reviews y PM.. digan dejandolos xfa... en verdad no saben como me decepciono cuando no dejan ninguno :/ quiero saber q opinan y sus sugerencias.. sobretodo que creen que sucederá mas adelante :) Nos leemos luego :) -3 MILET AVANCE: Hoy me siento triste, no puedo evitarlo tú me pides que me aleje, que te deje y que me olvide de este sentimiento, de todo este tiempo tantos besos de ternura, me parece una locura que hoy me digas que nuestro amor es un problema sin solución sabes bien que no es tan fácil, no es tan fácil olvidarte y no me quieras matar de amor si sabes bien que este corazón sin tus besos ya no late, no hace más que recordar tu voz[Chapter 59] Capítulo 59 - ¿Te vas? – me preguntó sentándose a mi lado. - Eso parece – le respondí nerviosa. Mi corazón se encogía – Es mejor empezar a reconstruir mi vida lo más pronto posible. - ¿Y qué pasará con nosotros? ¿Qué pasará... conmigo? ¿En dónde quedo yo, Alex? - Esa es tu decisión, Josh. Yo ya tomé la mía y te la dije. - No es así, Alex – su voz sonaba llena de ira – Tú estás tomando la decisión por mí. Lo que yo quiero de mi vida es pasarla a tu lado, pero tú simplemente me apartas, decides que ya no me quieres en tu vida. - ¿Y qué quieres que haga, Josh? ¿Qué olvide tu engaño? Pues no puedo, no puedo perdonarte. No permitiré que me hagas más daño del que me has hecho. Ya no hay un nosotros – inevitablemente las lágrimas rodaban por mis mejillas – No puedo olvidar, no quiero tener que recordar el dolor que siento cada vez que te vea. - Pero yo te amo. Necesito que me ames lo suficiente y confíes en mí cuando te digo que yo también fui una víctima. No eres la única que sufre con esto. Siento que mi vida se cae a pedazos, quiero despertar de esta pesadilla, quiero regresar el tiempo y evitar el daño. - No puedes… - ¿Por qué no confías en mí? – me preguntó en un susurro. - ¿cómo puedo hacerlo? Te di todo lo que soy Josh, pero me mentiste. Me usaste como un barandal solo para escalar en tu popularidad y pretendes que te crea que no me engañaste, que solo fuiste otra víctima ¿cómo quieres que confíe en ti? Su expresión fue como si le hubiera dado un puñetazo. Me miró lleno de dolor – Tienes razón, no puedo pedirte eso… solo puedo pedir una nueva oportunidad. Nos quedamos en silencio. Mi corazón anhelaba el poder darle esa oportunidad, poder creerlo, pero había algo que no me lo permitía – Te Amo. No quiero perderte…no puedo perderte. Soy egoísta por quererte para mí, siempre supe que no te merecía pero no puedo renunciar a ti. Su cercanía me abrumaba como sus palabras. No sabía cómo podía decir esas palabras tan fácilmente. El amor no mentía. Josh no sabía lo que era amar. - ¿No me amas? ¿Dejaste de amarme? – fue un susurro, uno que llego a estremecer mi alma, despertando la necesidad de perderme en sus brazos. Nada cambiaría mi decisión ahora. Solo tenía que encontrar la manera de finalizar este capítulo y dar la vuelta a la página. Mi vida últimamente estaba llena de pérdida, pero esta vez quería mi adiós. Si pudiera dejar de amarlo tan rápidamente como había aprendido a hacerlo esto fuera diferente. Sabría qué pasaría, que lo olvidaría… mucho me temo no conseguirlo. Ataqué sus labios. Lo sorprendí pero se dejó llevar. Ese sería mi adiós, mi punto final. Agarré el dobladillo de su playera y tiré de ella hacia arriba. Lo empujé contra el sofá y me senté a horcajadas sobre él besándolo con furia. - Alex… - sofoqué sus interrogantes con mi boca. No quería que piense en lo que estábamos haciendo. Quería que solo se concentrara en mi cuerpo, en mi piel, en nuestra conexión. Me restregué contra él tratando de que pierda la cabeza. Lo logré. Quitó mi camisa y mi pantalón, dejándome solo con mi ropa interior. Se puso de pie sosteniéndome y yo enredé mis piernas en su cadera ganándome un gemido de su parte. De alguna manera me sentí poderosa. Podía hacer lo que quisiera con él. Me llevó a su habitación y me dejó en su cama cerniéndose sobre mí. Desabroché sus pantalones y él se los quito junto con sus boxers. Noté la gran excitación que tenía mientras seguía besándolo. Hizo un camino con su boca desde mi cuello, pasando por mi clavícula, llegando al valle de mis senos donde deshizo el broche de mi sujetador ayudándome a quitarlo. Continúo con su camino de besos hacia mi abdomen deteniéndose a jugar con mi ombligo. Me saco varios gemidos de excitación. Con sus dientes tomó un lado de mis bragas y las deslizó por mis piernas. Terminaron en algún lado del piso. Su boca fue a mis pantorrillas continuando con su paseo por mi cuerpo. Cada caricia de sus labios y lengua eran suaves y relajadas. No hambrientas ni exigentes… eran dulces. Volvió a cernirse sobre mí completamente y buscó mis labios – Eres la mujer más hermosa que existe, por dentro y por fuera. Eres un tesoro. Mi tesoro… Traté de retener las lágrimas pero me sentía vulnerable bajo sus besos. Trató de separarse de mí cuando notó como estas se deslizaban por mis mejillas pero envolví mis piernas en su cintura para evitarlo. Me miró y por sus ojos pude ver todo tipo de sentimiento y en ese momento supe que en verdad me amaba - ¿es esto una despedida? Su rostro reflejaba miedo y dolor. No le pude contestar. No quería hacerlo porque yo tampoco quería aceptarlo. Lo besé con furia con pasión, entregando mi alma en ese beso. Suavemente entro en mí. Ambos gemimos ante la sensación. Encajábamos perfectamente – Te Amo… jodidamente… demasiado. No podía hablar, si lo hacía me quebraría en ese momento. Empezamos con nuestra danza que nos conduciría al éxtasis. El silencio era llenado por nuestros gemidos y suspiros. Su aliento era cálido en mi cuello mientras dejaba besos ahí. Nos entregamos el uno al otro. Cuerpo, alma, corazón, ahora no eran solo uno. Podía ver el miedo, el dolor y el amor a través de sus ojos. Pero ahora era tarde… el amor ya no era suficiente. Llegamos a las puertas del cielo al mismo tiempo. Su cuerpo cayó rendido sobre el mío pero nunca perdió contacto con mis ojos. Cuando nuestras respiraciones se normalizaron, él habló – No hagas esto, Alex. No nos hagas esto. - Shhh – pusé mi dedo en sus labios – es hora de dormir. Deposité un pequeño beso en sus labios y me aferré a él. Cumplió mi deseo. No dijo nada más, solo nos arropó con las cobijas y me abrazó. Esta sería mi última noche entre sus brazos. Sin poder evitar mis lágrimas me aferré a él y caí en un profundo sueño. Desperté con el sonido de rasgueó de una guitarra. Abrí mis ojos y vi a Josh sentado frente a mí son su guitarra. Noto mis ojos abiertos y empezó a cantar. (Nuestro Cuento de Amor – Ariel Cordero: www_youtube_com/watch?v=degrz4ZwJGQ** ) Hoy me siento triste, no puedo evitarlo tú me pides que me aleje, que te deje y que me olvide de este sentimiento, de todo este tiempo tantos besos de ternura, me parece una locura que hoy me digas que nuestro amor es un problema sin solución sabes bien que no es tan fácil, no es tan fácil olvidarte y no me quieras matar de amor si sabes bien que este corazón sin tus besos ya no late, no hace más que recordar tu voz Dolía. Dolía mucho cada palabra. Mi alma se quebraba ahora ya que mi corazón no podía destrozarse más de lo que ya estaba. Dime que no es cierto, que todo es un sueño y pronto estaré despierto para continuar con nuestro cuento tú serás mi reina, yo seré tu reino y cada parte de mi cuerpo será tuyo al cien por ciento Y no me digas que nuestro amor es un problema sin solución sabes bien que no es tan fácil, no es tan fácil olvidarte y no me quieras matar de amor si sabes bien que este corazón sin tus besos ya no late, no hace más que recordar tu voz Quería obligarme a olvidar todo y refugiarme en sus brazos, pero mi razón no podía, no podía simplemente olvidar. Tampoco podía dejarlo de amar. Dime que no es cierto, que todo es un sueño y pronto estaré despierto para continuar con nuestro cuento de amor.. nuestro cuento de amor… Nos miramos durante un momento, él esperando mi respuesta y tratando de que mi firmeza no se derrumbará. Me puse de pie y pase a su lado saliendo de la habitación. Busqué mis cosas en la habitación de huéspedes y me vestí. No podía seguir soportando su presencia, no podía soportar el dolor de su cercanía. Arreglé mi maleta. No busqué la ropa en el cuarto de Josh, ya no la necesitaba. Solo me traerían recuerdos. Cuando estuve lista, Josh había servido el desayuno. Comimos en silencio. Luego me llevó hacia al aeropuerto. Ninguno rompió el silencio. Estuvo a mi lado todo el momento, incluso en la sala de espera. – Gracias por haberme dejado quedar en tu casa. Me miró pero no me respondió. - Vuelo 97-C, por favor abordar por la puerta número 18 –anunciaron por los parlantes. Llegó la hora. Sería el definitivo adiós. Me quedé congelada tratando de no pensar en lo que significaba. -Por favor Alex no puedes irte – Josh tomó mis manos y cayó de rodillas frente a mí. Las lágrimas no se hicieron esperar, rodaban por nuestras mejillas – Alex, te amo, por favor perdóname, no sabes cómo me arrepiento a cada segundo de lo que paso, por favor, por favor, no me dejes, no sé qué hacer sin ti a mi lado… Mi corazón se estrujaba con cada palabra, yo también lo amaba y quisiera que mi corazón lo perdonara como también quisiera que lo olvidara, pero sé que eso es imposible, siempre lo amaré pero no puedo estar con él cuando parte de mi lo odia por haberme traicionado – Josh, yo…. No puedo, no puedo olvidar, perdóname…. Su mirada de dolor hace que mi alma se rompa, ¿Por qué simplemente no puedo olvidar y perdonar?, ¿Por qué nos hago esto a los dos? Simplemente no puedo, nunca he sido de las personas que olvidan, siempre he tenido miedo de que si perdono las personas me vuelvan a defraudar – Te amo... – me dice Josh en un suspiro – Solo dime si tu aún me amas… Mis rodillas caen y ahora que estamos a la misma altura puedo ver más el sufrimiento de sus ojos que seguramente reflejan el mismo dolor que siento yo – Josh… no puedo, en verdad… - las lágrimas continúan cayendo por sus mejillas, y mi mano se levanta para acariciar su mejilla. Mis dedos acarician su rostro tratando de memorizarlo como lo han hecho otras veces, él cubre mi mano con la suya, y cerrando los ojos recuesta su rostro contra mi mano y se aferra a ella como si su vida dependiera de ello. -Última llamada para el vuelo 97-C, por favor abordar por la puerta número 18 – Josh se tensa al escuchar mi llamado, aunque no quiera, debo irme. Esta es la despedida, y la verdad no sé cómo sobreviviré después de este adiós. -Josh... te amo – no se en que momento me acerque a él y lo besé, con desesperación, con deseo, con amor, porque esta sería la última vez que lo haga, la última vez que pruebe sus dulces labios. Mis brazos están alrededor de su cuello y los suyos se aferran a mi cintura con tanta fuerza que me saca el aire, pero no me importa. Nuestro beso termina por la sensación de ahogo, yo me zafo de sus brazos y me pongo de pie. Él hace lo mismo y me vuelve a abrazar, yo me quedo estática con mis brazos muertos a cada lado de mi cuerpo. Josh besa mi frente y me moja con sus lágrimas. -Nunca dejaré de luchar – me dice rozando mis labios con los suyos, yo me alejo tomando mi maleta, pero él no deja ir mi mano – Nunca… -No lo hagas… yo no quiero que luches – y con eso me voy. No miro atrás porque sé que no soportaría ver el dolor que refleja. Entro en el túnel de abordaje aun con lágrimas en mi rostro. Me preparo para una nueva vida sin él, aunque la verdad no estoy segura de cómo será. La sensación me trae un deja vu de la primera vez que volví a mi país, cuando estaba segura de que no lo volvería ver. ¿Quién diría que nos volveríamos a encontrar? ¿Quién diría que algo tan bonito acabara así? Hoooola :) ¿que les pareció el capítulo? La verdad es q hubo algo que no m gusto.. estos capítulos han sido difíciles de escribir xq no se como explicar correctamente lo q cada uno debe sentir :) pero espero q les guste..! Pronto saldré de vacaciones y espero poder inspirarme mejor y tener las ideas mas claras :) La canción me encanta. Es el cover de un amigo.

Ella es una fantástica persona que le dio una maldita oportunidad. Ahora el viene a hacerse la víctima porque ella le dejó después de lo que él le hizo. No pudo mantener su maldita polla dentro de sus pantalones. Fue tu culpa, Josh. Más vale que ahora la dejes en paz o te la veras conmigo.[Chapter 60] Capítulo 60 Solo debe ser una pesadilla. No puede terminar todo así. No puede. Estoy solo acurrucado en la soledad de mi habitación. Recordando que hace solo unos días tenía a la niña de mis ojos en mis brazos. Ahora se ha ido. Sin más. Quizás ocurra un milagro, quizás ella me perdona o encuentre la forma de volver a ella. Quizás ella si esté embarazada y solo lo dijo para alejarme. O ahora lo está luego de nuestra última vez. No nos cuidamos sería lo más natural. Tengo que encontrar la manera de saberlo. Escucho pasos en mi casa, tal vez sea ella. Necesito que sea ella. - Esto es un asco hermano – dice Connor entrando a mi habitación - ¿desde cuándo no has limpiado? Te ves asqueroso. No respondí, no tenía fuerzas. Mi brote de esperanza había desaparecido nuevamente. - Vine a pasar un lindo fin de semana con mi hermano mayor antes de que regresé a su trabajo – no respondí de nuevo – Mamá ven a ver esto. Connor salió y mi mamá entró en mi habitación. Ella sabía que todo fue mal. Se sentó a mi lado y me abrazó. Pude derrumbarme sabiendo que ella me sostendría. Lloré. - Tranquilo hijo. Todo estará bien. - Nada estará bien. Ella se fue y no quiere que la busque. Perdí todo lo que amo. Me dejó desahogarme. – Supongo que esto quiere decir que no voy a ser tío – Connor sostenía un paquete de píldoras anticonceptivas – Lo encontré en el baño de la habitación de huéspedes. Mi pequeña tonta ilusión quedó destrozada.- Ya veo que estuviste con alguien – dijo mi mamá. Miró la habitación y encontró la ropa de Alex. - Es de ella. Tenía la esperanza de que estuviera embarazada o que ahora pudiera quedar en estado pero ya veo que no. La perdí para siempre. Ella se fue… me dejó. - Basta Josh – dijo mi hermano – No te la merecías. - Basta Connor – le espetó mi madre. - Es la verdad. Ella es una fantástica persona que le dio una maldita oportunidad. Ahora el viene a hacerse la víctima porque ella le dejó después de lo que él le hizo. No pudo mantener su maldita polla dentro de sus pantalones. Fue tu culpa, Josh. Más vale que ahora la dejes en paz o te la veras conmigo. Salió furioso de mi habitación y luego escuchamos el golpe de la puerta de entrada. Sabía que tenía razón, sabía que nunca la merecí, ella era un regalo, una bendición que yo no supe cuidar y ahora la perdía. - Es hora de que salgas de aquí, hijo. Debes seguir con tu vida. - ¿Cómo? – no tenía idea. ¿cómo puedo avanzar sin razones para seguir? - Viviendo día a día. Veras que con el tiempo te recuperas. - Lo dudó – mi mamá me miro con tristeza – lo intentaré. Por ti. Antes de regresar a mi trabajo decidí enviarle un mensaje. Tenía que intentarlo, no puedo simplemente resignarme. Grabé un video cantando una canción de cómo me sentía. (La herida – Ariel Cordero: www_youtube_com/watch?v=OUlTvjJ1SVU ) Lo que me pasa Hoy que ya no estás conmigo Tu silueta se me pierde entre las sombras De esta amarga soledad Y lo que siento Si te busco y no te encuentro Solo quedan los recuerdos De un pasado que ya nunca volverá No queda nada De tu aroma ya en mi almohada Ya tus gestos, tus palabras Se las fue llevando el vientouuuoo Y aquí en mi pecho Solo queda el descontento De no haberte dado tanto Como lo que tú buscabas en mi piel Sobre tu cuerpo Fui dejando mil pedazos de mi corazón Sin tus besos solo encuentro la desilusión Por qué solo pienso en ti Y de tu amor solo quedo la herida Y miro al cielo a ver si hallo el consuelo En algún lugar recóndito del tiempo De esta amarga soledad Y en otros besos Hoy te busco en otros brazos Te imagino en otro rostro en otro cuerpo Me doy cuenta q no estas Ya nada queda De tu amor ya nada queda Tu color de luna llena Se lo fue llevando el tiempooouuo Y aquí en mi pecho Solo queda el descontento De no haberte dado tanto Como lo que tú buscabas en mi piel Sobre tu cuerpo Fui dejando mil pedazos de mi corazón Sin tus besos solo encuentro la desilusión Por qué solo pienso en ti Y de tu amor solo quedo la herida No quería ocultar mis sentimientos de ella, tenía que asegurar que ella sepa que la amo. Quizás aún exista una esperanza, no me importa aferrarme a lo que sea. Pero todo eso se derrumbó cuando una mañana decidí ir con Jenn a desayunar en una cafetería. Nos sentamos a esperar nuestra orden, cuando en el televisor apreció uno de esos programas de farándula. No le tomé importancia hasta cuando la nombraron. - Todos teníamos esperanza de que la parejita del año arregle sus cosas, pero creo que un nuevo galán apareció para impedirlo. Nos enviaron este video exclusivamente tomado hace 2 días, en exclusiva solo para ustedes. Y empezó el video que rompió mi corazón. o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o Trataba de conciliar el sueño pero era imposible. Los recuerdos me invadían mi mente y mi corazón, tal vez era el hecho de que si toda hubiera seguido bien estaríamos celebrando nuestro primer aniversario. 1 año. Ahora es nada. Tiempo perdido. Corazones y almas rotas. Quería aferrarme a algo, algún pensamiento que me mantenga cuerda y no deje caer en la desesperación. Muchas veces he pensado que todo fue un sueño, una loca ilusión creada por una adolescente sobre un enamoramiento de su ídolo. Pero no es así. Todo es cierto y la realidad es dolorosa. Aparto los pensamientos y trato de dejar mi mente en blanco. Me revuelvo entre las cobijas y cierro mis ojos apretando mis párpados cuando los sonidos de una guitarra suenan en la calle. Me levanto y colocó mi bata para evitar el frío. Me acerco mi ventana y diviso a las figuras en la calle. Sonrío. Salgo de mi habitación y voy hacia el pequeño balcón donde puedo ver mejor y ellos a mí. Darío y los otros chicos de la banda están ahí, cada uno con algún instrumento: guitarras, bombos, incluso una pandereta. Han colocado un equipo de ampliación. Darío se encuentra sentado, con su guitarra y un micrófono, cuando nuestras miradas se encuentran, su voz se cola en mi corazón. (No se sienta sola – Pacho Marchán : watch?v=O1LoOEeAzhA ) No se sienta sola, ud no está solitaa.. solo míreme a los ojos y dese cuenta que tiene un corazón que la cuida… ya cambie esa carita, Busco frases dentro en mi mente, pa consolarla y hacerla sonreír No entiendo la razón pero saber que hay personas que me quieren… especialmente de esa manera me hace sentir mejor. Sonrío. Una auténtica sonrisa. No sé, piense que yo quiero aprovechar pero puede acercarse un poco más, solo sepa que este loco de amor, quiere un chance para entrar en su corazón. Que por las noches cuando duermas tu pienses en mí, mi amor que por las noches cuando reces tu pidas por mí que no nos puedan separar. Que cuando estemos tu y yo mirando al cielo, tocando estrellas, refugiados por la luna formando una cuna de pasión que cuando… oyendo una canción de amor tú me imagines cerca de ti... No se sienta sola, ud no está solitaa… solo míreme a los ojos y dese cuenta que tiene un corazón que la cuida... ya cambie esa carita, Busco frases dentro en mi mente, pa consolarla y hacerla sonreír. No sé, piense que yo quiero aprovechar pero puede acercarse un poco más, solo sepa que este loco de amor, quiere un chance para entrar en su corazón. Me apresuré a salir a la calle para encontrarme con él. Apreciaba mucho todo lo que ha hecho por mí últimamente. No dejaba que me deprima, estaba ahí para mí para no dejarme caer en mi miseria. Realmente aprecio eso. Que por las noches cuando duermas tu pienses en mí, mi amor que por las noches cuando reces tu pidas por mí que no nos puedan separar que cuando estemos tu y yo mirando al cielo, tocando estrellas refugiados por la luna formando una cuna de pasión que cuando oyendo una canción de amor tú me imagines cercad de tiiiiii. Quiero rehacer mi vida y no encuentro las pautas, pero quiero… estoy dispuestas a dejar que la cosas sucedan… si Darío esta en mi camino, pues lo recibiré con mis brazos abiertos. No se sienta sola y dejese querer al roce de sus manos, sintiendo su piel Levante esa carita que la quiero ver La luz de su sonrisa que me da el valor Pa confesarle lo que siento con temor Que todo lo que digo no sea suficiente Son esos ojos suyos lo de mi canción… Ahora me perdí en su mirada. Pude recordar los motivos por los que me enamoré de este chico alguna vez. Tan solo dese cuenta que este loco amoooor Espera por su amoooor, No es solo una ilusión Y este es el momento para estar los dos No se sienta sola, ud no está solitaa… solo míreme a los ojos y dese cuenta que tiene un corazón que quiere latir en su piel… Terminó su canción y me acerqué a él. Estábamos a menos de 20 cms cuando nuestras miradas se cruzaron y se quedaron ahí por un momento. Quizás fueron segundo o minutos, pero esos ojos verdes me mostraban esperanza y anhelo. Lo quería en mi vida. Pero tendría que pensar muy bien su papel. Su rostro se acercó al mío y pude desviar mi cara por lo que sus labios dieron en mi mejilla. Él sonrío. - Tranquila… soy lo suficientemente paciente para esperarte. - No estoy preparada… aun. No sé cuándo lo este. - No me importa… solo quiero tenerte a mi lado – tomó mis manos entre las suyas –haré lo posible por recuperar tu amor. Besó mi frente con dulzura yo pude evitar refugiarme en sus brazos. Tenía mucho en que pensar. o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o Sé que a ella le llegaron las palabras de la melodía. Lo vi en sus ojos. Mi corazón quería salirme del pecho y al mismo tiempo sentía que en cualquier momento querría detenerse. Cuando ella llegó a él supe que la había perdido. Estuvieron uno frente al otro por un momento y luego él la beso. No vi el beso porque alguien cubrió la escena pasando delante de la cámara pero quedó muy claro lo que sucedió y más cuando la última imagen del video era la de ellos abrazados. La perdí. - Sé que es una pregunta estúpida... – Jenn trató de llamar mi atención ya que yo no quitaba mis ojos de la pantalla aunque ahí no había nada que me interesara ya - ¿Estás bien? No lo estaba. Estaba dolido y furioso. No entendía como ella podía pasar la página y olvidarse de mí tan fácil y rápidamente. Hice algo impulsivo. Tomé mi celular y marqué. Ella no sería la única con alguien a su lado. Ya me canse de sufrir y que a ella no le importe ni un poco. - ¿Josh? - Clau… Hola – Claudia era una chica genial. Trabajamos juntos hace casi dos años y sé que no me es indiferente. En los últimos días nos hemos encontrado en varias ocasiones y ella no dudó en mostrar su interés. - Debo admitir que me sorprende tu llamada. - No debería hacerlo. Te dije que te llamaría. ¿Estás libre esta tarde? – Jenn me miró y negó con su cabeza. Sabía lo que pretendía pero no me importaba si era lo correcto. Necesitaba llegar al final con esto. - Claro… - acordamos el lugar y la hora para encontrarnos. Colgué y me enfrenté a Jenn. - NO puedo creer que hagas esto, Josh. No puedes actuar impulsivamente, te harás daño y se lo harás a esa chica. No puedes enfocar tus decisiones en los que tu exnovia haga. Tienes que dejarla atrás. - Eso es lo que voy a hacer. Confía en mí – sé que tiene razón, pero yo también tengo mis razones. Si ella puede rehacer su vida yo también. - Hola Josh – guau. Esta chica vino dispuesta a impresionarme. Llevaba una falda corta que apenas cubría su trasero y una blusa blanca prácticamente transparente que me dejaba apreciar su figura y su sujetador. -Clau. Estás hermosa – besé su mano y la invité a sentarse. Hablamos sobre muchas cosas, no sabía cómo tocar el tema que quería. Pero no fue necesario porque ella tomó la iniciativa. - Hace tiempo que no me divertía tanto – admití. - Buenoo…. – ella se acercó a mí y empezó a mover su dedo índice por todo mi pecho – Podemos divertirnos así siempre. - Me halagas – dije con mi tono coqueto. - Debo admitir que siempre me has gustado, Josh. Pensé… que tenía una oportunidad contigo cuando trabajamos juntos pero tú nunca me miraste. Me gustas, Josh. Mucho. Y si quieres darme una oportunidad sería muy feliz. En serio no sabía que responder, mejor dicho lo sé, para eso he venido aquí pero una parte de mí no quiere. - Me gustas también – era verdad, era una buena chica, linda y divertida. Pero no era Alex – Quiero ser sincero contigo… - Sé que la relación con esa chica iba en serio. No te preocupes por ello. Seré paciente y estoy segura de poder ayudarte a olvidarla. Solo necesito esa oportunidad. Para ti, para mí. Para nosotros. - No será fácil… - aunque ella decía justamente lo que quería, me sentía culpable. Tenía que hacer esto – Pero si estás dispuesta a ello… Me cortó con un beso. Sus labios eran suaves y coquetos. Respondí a ese beso y aumenté su intensidad. Sus brazos fueron a mi cuello y mis manos a su cintura. Debo confesar que de cierta manera disfrute el contacto de sus labios. Me hizo sentir deseado y querido. Sé que es patético pero necesitaba sentir ese tipo de contacto, pero por más que tratara, mi mente y mi cuerpo sabían que no era Alex. Nunca sería ella. Y debía empezar a vivir con ello. Ahora tenía una nueva novia. Luego de dejarla en su departamento y despedirme con un beso. Fui a un bar. Compré una botella de ron y trago tras trago la terminé. Desde mi celular le envié un mensaje a su Whatsapp. Quizás era el último recurso que tenía. Aun no me había bloqueado. Adjunte el enlace de una canción. No me importa que mi corazón se vuelva a romper porque ella no me contestara. Con la cantidad de alcohol en mi cuerpo que tengo este momento nada importa de verdad. Parte de mí quería saber de ella una vez más. Hoooolaaa :) ¿Quéles pareció? estos chicos buscan reemplazo rapidamente eh? bueno la verdad es q no he tenido tiempo ni inspiración para escribir mas pero no quería dejarles sin cap :) les cuento q ya casi terminó mis exámenes y solo dudo de una materia... espero no dar exámenes supletorios aunq no estoy segura :/ Van a encontrar muchos de estos capítulos en los q haya versiones de ambos.. creo q hay cosas q serían mejor q los cuente el otro y no quería que el cap sea demasiado corto.

Josh. Seguir sin él se sentía como navegar por la vida sin brújula, me sentía perdida y desesperada por encontrar alguna señal para llegar a un lugar seguro. No quería llorar pero si mi corazón necesitaba lágrimas para lidiar con ello estaba en obligación de dárselo.[Chapter 61] Capítulo 61 - Estoy embarazada. No podía creerlo. Lo sospechaba, pero no podía estar segura. - ¿desde cuándo lo sabes? – me aferré a mi amiga en un abrazo. - Lo sabía desde que no llegó mi periodo y ahora tengo 18 semanas de embarazo. No sé qué voy a hacer. Me sentía pésimo por ser una mala amiga. Abracé a Fernanda mientras lloraba. Había notado los síntomas el mes pasado, tampoco le pregunté si se había cuidado cuando estuvo con Santiago en la playa después de lo que me dijo cuándo pensé que yo estaba embarazada de Josh. - ¿Por qué no me lo dijiste cuando supiste? – me dolía que me oculte cosas. - Tenía miedo. No sabía qué hacer. Quise… quise abortar ¿vale? – me impresionó esa confesión. Ella era un mar de lágrimas - Y no quería que te decepcionaras de mí. No pude. Es mi hijo y suyo. Es un pedacito de ambos. Estaba confundida y luego Josh y tú… no podía abrumarte más. - Oh por Dios – la abracé más fuerte y lloré con ella – soy una pésima amiga, Fer. Tu estuviste ahí para mí y yo te defraudé. - Tú tenías mucho con lo que lidiar. Yo no… no podía empeorar las cosas para ti. - ¿Y qué hay de ti? Necesitabas a alguien – me necesitaba y yo solo me concentré en mis problemas. Estuvimos así por otro momento. Yo consolándola, susurrándole palabras de aliento. Sé lo que siente, lo experimenté en carne propia. Se siente sola. Perdida. Desorientada, sin saber que le depara el futuro. - Mi mamá ya lo sabe – suelta – Se siente decepcionada. La decepcioné pero finalmente me apoyará. Pero será difícil. Tendré que decir adiós a la oportunidad de obtener una beca para un posgrado. Tendré que buscar empleo inmediatamente. Mi mamá dijo que ayudará a cuidarlo. - Tranquila. Habrá maneras. Hay muchas personas que estudian y son madres. Tú sabes que pagan bien si trabajas como residente. Lo bueno de ser estudiante de posgrado es que nos aseguran un trabajo como residentes en algún hospital o clínica mientras terminamos de estudiar. - Pero ese dinero no será suficiente para pagar mantenerme al bebé y a mí y encima un préstamo si no consigo una beca. - Pero tú no eres la única responsable de ese bebé. Santiago tiene que ayudarte con ello – al oír el nombre de mi amigo empezó a sollozar de nuevo. - Debe estar en camino. Mi mamá dice que es lo mejor, que es algo que ya no podré ocultar por mucho más tiempo y que mi bebé necesita un padre. - Es lo justo… para todos. Como si fuera invocado, Santiago entró en la habitación de Fernanda. Nos miró preocupado al notar que habíamos llorado. - ¿Qué sucede? Fernanda se sentó derecha y se secó las lágrimas. Él la vio con preocupación y curiosidad. Se acercó a ella, se puso en cuclillas y tomó su mentón - ¿Qué sucede, chica bonita? Sonrío al recordar la forma en que él la llamaba cuando estaban juntos. Eran la pareja perfecta. Se querían. No tenían que haberse separado. Ahora tendrán un hijo. Tal vez eso les ayude a reconocer lo que sienten. Sé que mi amiga lo quiere y según Josh, Santiago siente lo mismo aunque esté con Lisset. Josh. Siempre está presente. Cada día era más difícil. Lo extrañaba malditamente, pensaba en el cada momento que mi mente no estaba ocupada. Aun no podía superarlo. Me concentré en Santiago secando las lágrimas de mi amiga con sus pulgares. Se aman. Es evidente. - Estoy embarazada. Santiago de un salto se apartó de ella. Pude ver como se tensaba al entender sus palabras. Sus manos se volvieron puños y su pecho subía y bajaba con furia. Me tomó un momento entender su reacción. Él no sabía que era su bebé. Mi amiga sollozó con más fuerza viendo su reacción, seguramente malinterpretando la razón de su comportamiento. Santiago se veía furioso y tomó el pomo de la puerta para irse cuando me vi en la obligación de aclarar las cosas – Es tuyo. Creo que su corazón se detuvo y luego comenzó a bombear con más fuerza. Me miró expectante y luego miró a mi amiga. Se acercó a ella, se sentó a su lado y la abrazó. Ella se aferró a él como si su vida dependiera de ello. - ¿Es verdad? – le preguntó tomándola del mentón para hacer contacto visual. Cuando ella asintió él miró a su vientre. Aun no era evidente a pesar de que ya estaba casi de 5 meses. Seguramente son sus genes. Fer tiene una prima que estaba cerca de dar a luz y apenas se le notaba un pequeño bultito. – Nosotros solo estuvimos una vez juntos y eso es hace meses. - ¿Estás dudando de mí? – dijo mi amiga alejándose de él. - No es eso. Es solo… es que… diablos, no sé cómo decirlo sin que lo tomes como una ofensa. Iba a matarlo. Sé que no era su intención pero sus tonterías estaban dañando más a mi amiga – Tiene 18 semanas, solo que no se le nota. Él se acercó a ella con cara de disculpa. Ella se apartó pero él la atrapo en un gran abrazo y un instante después en un cálido beso. Yo ya no hacía falta aquí. Decidí salir de ahí cuando Fernanda envolvió sus brazos en el cuello de mi amigo. Cerré la puerta y fui hacia la sala para encontrarme con la madre de Fernanda que al parecer iba de salida. - ¿Qué tal todo por ahí? – dijo señalando con su cabeza la dirección de donde venía. - Creo que mejor de lo que esperábamos. Tenía que salir de ahí antes de que tanta dulzura me provoque diabetes. - Me alegro. – sonrío – debo admitir que no esperaba ser abuela tan pronto. Sé que será duro para ellos, pero también sé que lo lograrán. Se quieren y eso es mucho más de lo que otras parejas tienen en casos similares. - La tendrán difícil pero nos tienen para ayudarlos. - Eres una buena chica, Alexandra. Algún día tú también serás feliz – esperaba que eso fuera cierto – Ahora tengo que irme. No te importa quedarte sola ¿verdad? - Tranquila. Vaya con cuidado, yo le aviso a Fer. Me dejó sola en el salón. Temía estar sola. Mis pensamientos me envolvían y no podía evitar deprimirme. Mis pensamientos siempre terminaban en una persona. Josh. Seguir sin él se sentía como navegar por la vida sin brújula, me sentía perdida y desesperada por encontrar alguna señal para llegar a un lugar seguro. No quería llorar pero si mi corazón necesitaba lágrimas para lidiar con ello estaba en obligación de dárselo. Mi celular vibró en el bolsillo de mi chaqueta. Lo tomé y abrí el mensaje que había llegado a mi Whatsapp. \"Es en serio? Xq él? Tan rápido dejaste de amarme? Dame la fórmula para olvidarte como tú lo haces conmigo xq en verdad no encuentro manera de seguir sin ti...\" Su mensaje fue como una daga para mi corazón y más aún cuando su siguiente mensaje era una canción que terminó destrozándome el alma. (Here Without you – 3 Doors Down: www_youtube_com/watch?v=Ok71HEaE75Q ) . Escuché cada palabra de la maldita canción mientras mis lágrimas rodaban por mis mejillas. No traté de detenerlas, no tenía sentido alguno. No importa el tiempo que transcurriera el dolor no disminuía y me estaba ahogando en mi propio sufrimiento. No sabía si contestarle o no. Me imagino que él supone que estoy con Darío pero no es así, no puedo pasar la página tan fácilmente como él. Trato de relajarme dando profundas respiraciones. Encuentro el control del televisor y lo enciendo. Necesito distraerme con algo antes de que explote. Pero no fue la mejor idea. Me di cuenta cuando terminé en un programa de chismes. Ahí mismo decía de la nueva relación de Josh con su co-protagonista Claudia Traisac. Muestran un video de ellos besándose en una cafetería asegurando que la escena fue tomada este mismo día. No sé porque pero tomé una foto con mi celular a la pantalla y se la envié. \"Basta, Josh. Se nota que no puedes superarme. Respeta a tu novia y no vuelvas a buscarme. Además no eres nadie para juzgarme con quien estoy. Tú ya has hecho tu vida, deja de interferir en la mía. ADIÓS.\" Cada palabra dolió. Me sentía como una estúpida. Una vez más me dejé convencer por sus palabras para luego estrellarme contra el muro de la verdad. Solo haré una cosa más por él antes de dejarlo ir. Me prometo a mí misma superarlo. Regresaré con Darío. Trataré de todas las formas inimaginables de amarlo y seré feliz con él. No habrá más Josh en mi vida. Hooolaaa..! en verdad quiero saber q opinan... pensaba en dedicar un capitulo para el romance de Fernanda y Santiago pero no quería salirme de la historia :) También se que estos capítulos no son los mas emocionantes.. les pido q me perdonen pero me falta inspiración y tiempo (época de exámenes :/) también espero q entiendan el conflicto de sentimientos de Alex y Josh al quererse y no poder estar juntos y la necesidad de avanzar. Algunos mns me han preguntado xq no elegí q Alex sea de EEUU o le puse nombre a un país en especial... bueno no la puse en EEUU xq quería un amor a la distancia y ademas la debilidad de Josh x las latina .. yeah! y no sabía que otro país de latinoamerica poner.. como les dije yo soy de Ecuador, y muchas veces describo cosas de mi entorno. como la ciudad de Alex. Les sugiero que busquen datos sobre mi ciudad CUENCA..! x ejm el hecho de que haya varios parques junto a ríos.. Mi ciudad es atravesada por 4 ríos y a las orillas tienen los llamados parque lineales que estan llenos de arboles, plantas y es hermoso para caminar.. son seguros :) Lo de la facultad de medicina q esta junto a un hospital y al parque \"El paraíso\" todo eso lo describí basándome en mi ciudad.. quizás en alguna otra oportunidad ponga nombre.. pero bueno espero q se hayan imaginado el lugar justo como quise describirlo :P les dejaré un link en mi perfil para q puedan verlas :) www_fanfiction_net/~milet7393 .. se q son muchos :P.. solo copien los links :) espero q los vean y me digan q les pareció.. yo disfruto de esos paisajes todos los días :) Como les dije ando en época de examen y un pokito complicada... espero poder escribir pronto para no hacerles esperar mucho :) Gracias x sus reviews y pm :) sigan dejandolos y diganme q creen q sucederá :) ...- Nos leemos luego ...-3 MILET AVANCE: Bufé - ¿Mi ejemplo? En todo caso fui yo quien siguió su ejemplo. Yo empecé mi relación con Darío luego que él con Claudia. Me miro inquisitivamente – No sé qué decir. Ayúdame a entenderlo. Ustedes se aman, son infelices separados. Son miserables, se extrañan, tratan de avanzar pero no pueden. ¿Por qué no están juntos?[Chapter 62] Capítulo 62 No le respondí. No podía, me sentía hipócrita reclamarle algo y al mismo tiempo furioso porque ella fue quien se refugió en los brazos de su exnovio. Me levanté de mi cama y fui a mi baño. Mi aspecto en el espejo era horrible. Tenía ojeras muy grandes, se notaba el cansancio en mi rostro. Pero era inevitable. Prefería no dormir a enfrentar las imágenes de ella con otro que brillaban en mis sueños. No soportaba la idea de ella con otro. Ella era mía. Era… Dos semanas y aun no tenía el valor de devolver su mensaje. Moría por saber de ella pero sus respuestas me hacían daño. Mi celular sonó. Era Steven. - Enciende tu televisor ahora – no me detuve a saludarlo y lo hice. Pregunté que canal y lo sintonicé. - Días atrás tuvimos noticias de la parejita más nombrada de este año. Cada uno tiene su nuevo romance así que debemos resignarnos a no verlos juntos – dijo una presentadora. - Si te soy sincera, yo amaba verlos juntos. Ellos emanaban amor a cientos de kilómetros. Pero así son las relaciones. Terminan. - Tengo que diferir contigo. Amo las nuevas parejas. Josh y Claudia y sobretodo Alex y Darío. Ese chico ha logrado llevarse con el corazón de muchas chicas con la forma de declararse a su novia. Y era necesario, tenía gran competencia. Superar a Josh Hutcherson no era una tarea fácil. - Por cierto, debemos aclarar que ahora son Alex y Darío son novios oficialmente. Lo sé. Todos pensamos que ya lo eran luego de esa romántica serenata pero al parecer nuestra chica lo hizo esperar para dar su respuesta hasta el día de ayer donde aceptó su proposición durante una presentación de su banda. La chica también es romántica. A continuación el video que todos esperamos ver. - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - ¿Estás segura de querer cantar está canción? - No pretendo que entiendas pero necesito decir mi último adiós. - Tranquila – Darío acariciaba mi mejilla – Haz lo que necesites hacer. Te lo dije. Esperaré por ti toda la eternidad si es necesario. - ¿Aún quieres estar conmigo? Sonrío – La propuesta sigue en pie. Besé su mejilla y me preparé para la presentación. Cantábamos en la inauguración de un nuevo parque recreativo. Subimos al escenario. Todos los chicos estaban emocionados. Gracias al triunfo en el festival musical ahora teníamos pequeños contratos. No necesitaba el dinero, pero los demás sí. Además me servía de distracción, amaba cantar. Las tonadas empezaron y me preparé para cantarla. De alguna forma esperaba que Josh la escuchara y entendiera. Era mi forma de pasar la página. Era mi adiós. (GoodBye – Miley Cyrus: www_youtube_com/watch?v=ofeDkncAy6A ) Sentí cada palabra. Me dolía el corazón pero ahora estaba decidida a superarlo. No podía pasar la vida hundiéndome en el recuerdo de Josh. Mientras terminaba la canción busqué la mirada de Darío. Ese dulce chico que me quería a pesar de todo lo que le hice. No lo merecía, pero haría lo posible por hacerlo. Terminé la canción y lo enfrente. Nuestros ojos se encontraron y pronuncié las palabras que daría inicio a mi nueva vida. – Acepto… Sí. Le tomó un segundo entender lo que quería decir. Dejo su guitarra y se acercó a mí. Me abrazó y luego tomó mi rostro con ambas manos y me besó. Le devolví el beso. Me sentía segura y amada. Necesitaba sentir ambas cosas. - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O La juzgué. Y volví a perderla. Ahora ella tenía a otro. Ver eso beso me destrozó. Nadie se dio cuenta de que esa canción era una despedida. Un adiós… para mí. Apagué el televisor y me dejé caer en el sofá. Ya no podía recuperarla. Ya no tenía caso gritarle mis sentimientos porque ella ya no los quiere. Me encerré todo el día a pensar. Debería dejarla ir, pero no quería. Sin embargo estaba lejos y no podía alcanzarla. Mi puerta se abrió dando paso a mi mamá y a mi hermano. Pensé que estaban en Kentucky. - Hola mamá – trate de sonreí - ¿Qué hacen aquí? - ¿Otra vez hundiéndote en tu miseria? – mi hermano me mira enfadado. Espero que algún día me perdone por lo que hice. Él quiere mucho a Alex y para él soy un villano. - Basta Connor – dijo mi madre furiosa – sé que quieres a esa chica pero las cosas sucedieron. Josh es tu hermano y cometió un error. No necesita que lo atormentemos toda la vida por ello. Somos su familia, debemos apoyarlo. Connor bajó la mirada – Perdón hermano. Mamá tiene razón. - No hay problema, hermano. - Así me gusta – nos abrazó mi mamá – Nos vamos a pasar con tus abuelos. Entendí lo que eso significaba. Ni siquiera me invitaban. Sabrían que no soportaría tenerla cerca. - Entiendo. Saluden a los abuelos de mi parte. - Nos vamos mañana. Quería muchas cosas. Quería ir con ellos, verla, besarla y no soltarla nunca. Pero no podía. Trataba de pasar todo el tiempo con mi mente ocupada. Pasaba con Claudia y sí, me había acostado con ella pero era solo sexo. No sabía si alguna vez volvería hacer el amor. No quería ver televisión por miedo a encontrarme con alguna noticia sobre que me lastimara más. La última vez que lo había hecho hablaban sobre su amistad con mi hermano Connor. Él había publicado una foto con ella y con Darío. Me sentía de cierto modo traicionado y envidiaba que él pudiera tenerla de algún modo. Así sea como amiga. También me enteré de que Santiago y Fernanda se casaron. Me alegro por ellos. Al menos pueden ser felices junto a la persona que aman. Le envié un mensaje de felicitación a mi amigo. Me comentó sobre el embarazo de ella. Lo envidiaba. Hubiera querido ser yo el que se casaba y tenía en camino un bebé. Pero no fue así. Y me siento solo. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - Vamos Alex. Solo un momento. Puedes decirle a tu novio que venga a cenar con nosotros – la abuela de Josh insistía en que me quedará a cenar. La había acompañado al médico. A pesar de lo que paso con Joshua no podía alejarme de su familia. Ellos no tenían la culpa, no podía juzgarlos por lo que me había hecho y además les tenía un gran cariño. - No quiero molestar – además me sentía incómoda con Darío cenando con los abuelos de mi ex. - Por favor, Alex. Te tengo una sorpresa – me miró con dulzura. No me pude negar. - Esta bien – bajamos del coche y entramos. - Quédate aquí. Voy por tu sorpresa – me senté en el sofá de la sala y llamé a Darío para avisarle de los nuevo planes. - Hola, pequeña. - Hola, pequeño. Te llamo para avisarte que hubo un cambio de planes para hoy. - Mmmm? Escucho. - SI quieres negarte estás en todo tu derecho. - Dímelo rápido. Me estas asustando. - Bueno. La señora Hutcherson nos invitó a cenar. No pude negarme, lo intenté. - Sabes lo incómodo que es eso – hice un sonido de afirmación – Bueno, mientras estés a mi lado estaré bien. Voy a mi última clase y luego voy para allá. - Eres un sol, pequeño. - Todo por ti – sonreí – Por cierto Fernanda me pidió que te dijera que si podías hacer la cita con la ginecóloga para ella mañana. No encuentra su celular y ahí tenía el número telefónico. - No hay problema. Ahora lo hago. - Nos vemos pronto… te amo. – me quede congelada. No podía responderles como él quería por suerte el cortó la llamada y no me vi obligada a decir algo que no sentía. Me acerqué a la ventana a contemplar el bello jardín. Marqué el número de la ginecóloga. Me contestó su secretaria. Solicite el turno y di los datos de mi amiga. - Es una cita para control del embarazo ¿verdad? - Sí. Queremos una ecografía, esperamos saber el sexo del bebé. - ¿Cuántas semanas de gestación tiene la paciente? - 20 semanas. - Listo. La cita queda para mañana a las 4 de la tarde. - Muchas gracias – asentí. Guardé mi teléfono y giré para encontrarme con una visita inesperada. - ¿Estás embarazada? – dirigió su mirada a mi vientre. Llevaba mi típica blusa ajustada en el busto y floja en el abdomen. Podría ocultar un vientre abultado fácilmente. Pero este no era el caso - ¿Es de mi hijo? Negué con la cabeza. Estaba sorprendida por su presencia. Nunca pensé conocer a mi exsuegra de esta manera – No lo niegues. Hace 20 semanas estabas con mi hijo. Ese bebé es mi nieto ¿verdad? Recupere mi voz – No estoy embarazada. La cita es para mi amiga. - Ohh – se quedó sin voz – Perdóname. No quise entrometerme de ese modo. - Pierda cuidado. Entiendo sus razones – sonreí tratando de tranquilizarla. - Es un gusto conocerte en persona, Alex - me ofreció su mano. - Igualmente señora Hutcherson – le di un cálido apretón. - Llámame Michelle, por favor. – me gusto su actitud. Su sonrisa era genuina – Admito que hubiera preferido conocerte en otras circunstancias. Pareces una buena chica. Ahora sé lo que ve mi hijo en ti. Mi corazón se encogió. No sabía que responderle. Por suerte un ángel me salvó del momento incómodo. - ALEX! – gritó Connor y corrió hacia mí. Me lancé en sus brazos. Extrañaba a mi amigo – Te extrañé pequeña. - Yo también. Nos sentamos en una charla muy animada. Agradecí a ambos por no sacar el tema de Josh a colocación. Escuchamos el timbre. Darío había llegado. Traía consigo un pie de fresa. Uno de mis favoritos. La madre de Josh se sorprendió un poco cuando luego de saludar a la abuela, se acercó a mí y me dio un pequeño beso en los labios. Esto era incómodo. - Hola – me susurró. Pasó su brazo alrededor de mi cintura. - Les presentó a Darío… mi novio – lo último lo dije casi en un susurro – A Connor ya lo conoces. Ella es Michelle, su mamá. - Mucho gusto – Darío saludo con un beso en la mejilla a mi ex suegra y le dio un saludo de chicos a Connor. Fue incómodo. La manera en que Michelle miraba a mi novio, quizás se pregunte que veo en él y lo compara con su hijo. No lo sé. Pasamos a cenar. Debo agradecerle a Connor por mantener una conversación relajada. Sus abuelos le hacían preguntas a Darío. Era gracioso porque era como escuchar a mis papás. Le decía que si me hacía daño le harían pagar. Sonreí. Me sentía querida. Darío mantuvo entrelazados nuestros dedos todo el tiempo. De vez en cuando me miraba, podía ver el cariño que emanaba. También besaba mi mejilla. A Connor y a sus abuelos no les afectaba este gesto, pero pude ver que Michelle se revolvía incómoda en su silla. - Estuvo delicioso el pie, Darío – dijo la abuela - Debes decirme dónde comprarlo. - La verdad… - dijo sonrojándose – lo hice yo. No podía llegar con las manos vacías. - Pues te felicito, eres un excelente repostero – es verdad. Este niño cocina delicioso. - Ya que mi novia no le gusta cocinar, uno de nosotros debe alimentarnos cuando vivamos juntos - Casi escupo el jugo que estaba tomando. Él estaba hablando de vivir juntos ¿boda? ¿WTF? Todos tuvieron la misma reacción: sorpresa – Es decir, si algún día vivimos juntos. Mi mamá siempre nos decía a mi hermano y a mí que saber cocinar bien era una de las mejores maneras de conquistar el corazón de una mujer. - Es verdad – dijo el abuelo – a mi mujer le gustaba mucho los pancakes que preparaba. A veces pienso que se casó conmigo solo por eso. Todos reímos y la conversación se relajó. - Alex. ¿Puedo hablar contigo un momento? – Michelle estaba de pie. Todos nos miraron expectantes. Sabían cómo yo perfectamente de que íbamos a hablar. Salimos al jardín posterior y nos sentamos en la misma banca que tantas veces habíamos usado Josh y yo. Se mantuvo el silencio por un momento y fue ella quien lo rompió. - ¿Eres feliz? - Si – no era completamente una mentira. Ella me dio una media sonrisa. - ¿Eres realmente feliz? ¿con… él? No quería responderle. Darío me hacía feliz, no me dejaba deprimirme y siempre me sacaba sonrisas. Pero no era lo suficiente para sentirme completa. Solo con Josh había sido completa y realmente feliz, al igual que ahora era miserable por él. - Ese silencio lo explica… ¿Aún quieres a mí hijo? – No quería responder a eso – Él es miserable. Quizás más que tú, pero sufre y me parte el alma verlo de esa manera. - No creo que sea tan miserable. Tiene a alguien nuevo en su vida… solo se siente mal por lo que me hizo – sabía que mis palabras no eran verdad. Muy dentro de mí sabía que Josh me amó de alguna manera – Ahora tiene a Claudia… se recuperará. - Está con ella porque quiere superarte así como tú lo haces. Quizás lo hizo por seguir tu ejemplo. Bufé - ¿Mi ejemplo? En todo caso fui yo quien siguió su ejemplo. Yo empecé mi relación con Darío luego que él con Claudia. Me miro inquisitivamente – No sé qué decir. Ayúdame a entenderlo. Ustedes se aman, son infelices separados. Son miserables, se extrañan, tratan de avanzar pero no pueden. ¿Por qué no están juntos? - Porqué él me engañó – grité exasperada – me usó. Le di todo, mi corazón, mi alma, mi vida y él solo me utilizó a su conveniencia. No puedo… no puedo perdonar ni olvidar. No sabe lo que haría por poder hacerlo. Lo amo, ese es el maldito problema. No puedo dejar de hacerlo, no es algo que tenga un interruptor para poder acabarlo. Pero tampoco me siento lo suficientemente fuerte para volver a su lado. Sé que como soy, sé que cada vez que lo mire recordaré todo y al final me haré y le haré más daño. - Mi hijo nunca te hubiera engañado. Te amaba, realmente. Vivía por ti. Eras su mundo... Eres su mundo. Deberías confiar en él. - No puedo – empecé a sollozar – no puedo confiar en él. Mi corazón no puede creerle al 100%. Puedo tratar pero siempre estará esa duda. No puedo ser feliz así. Lamento si no es lo que quiere oír. Lamento si cree que soy una mala persona, lamento lo que sea que su hijo siente. Pero por primera vez en mi vida quiero ser egoísta y vivir por mí. Vivir para seguir adelante y buscar mi felicidad y en esos planes no está Josh. Me miró tristemente y me abrazó – Lo siento. Tenía que entenderlo. Me duele ver a mi hijo destrozado, pero tienes razón. No te considero una mala persona. Todos buscamos nuestra felicidad y tomamos las decisiones que creemos que son las correctas. Espero que así sea. Por tu bien y el de todos. Volvimos con los demás. De alguna manera me sentí cómoda con ella. Había dicho lo que tenía que decir. Todo fue mucho mejor. Aproveché esos días para salir con Connor. Era un buen amigo. Nos acompañó a la boda de mis mejores amigos. Cuando estábamos en la fiesta de la boda decidí salir un momento al jardín de la recepción. Hacía frío por lo que me aferré a mi abrigo. Me senté y miré al cielo. Era una linda noche. Me traía recuerdos. Recuerdo estar sentada en este mismo lugar con Josh en la boda de mi hermano. Fue luego de decirnos \"te amo\". Esa noche planeamos muchas cosas, prometimos muchos más. Solo fueron palabras. De pronto mi celular y el de Connor vibraron en mi bolsillo al mismo tiempo. Mi amigo me había dado a cuidar su móvil. En mi móvil había un nuevo mensaje de Whatsapp. Era de Josh. Sabía que el mensaje de Connor era de él. No sé por qué pero decidí comprobarlo. Leí primero el mensaje de Connor. Josh envió la foto que nos habíamos tomado ayer con Darío y él en el cine. También adjunto el link de una canción y un mensaje: \" Haz que lo escuché\" Miré mi mensaje y tenía la misma foto y canción, pero con un mensaje diferente: \" Siento tanto quererte y no tenerte. Quisiera convencerte y convencerme de que estoy bien, pero ya no quiero mentir más. Envidio a Connor por tenerte cerca…\" Y ahí estaba yo otra vez llorando por nosotros. Soy masoquista. Abrí el enlace para escuchar la canción (Si la vez – Franco de Vita & Sin Bandera: www_youtube_com/watch?v=nweWaRpg9Qo ) y sollocé con cada palabra. No respondí. Yo ya había dicho mi adiós. Necesitaba que él me dejara ir. Hooollaaa? Ok se q estoy alargando lo evidente q pasará pero tenía muchas ideas vagas y quería ponerlas en los capítulo... aun estoy peleando con el Cap. 64...! En realidad se me hace difícil especificar los sentimientos. Quiero q Alex trate de avanzar y tenga dudas de su decisión xq parte de ella se siente traicionada pero otra parte sabe que él la ama y no haría eso. pero todo es una confusión. A Josh quiero darle un toque impulsivo y dolido. saltar a una relación rápidamente pero al mismo tiempo no tiene intenciones de avanzar.. ¿Les gusto la manera de conocer a la madre de Josh? fue algo que se me ocurrió derepente.. espero q estos capítulos con las 2 versiones no los confunda o aburra :) Bueno les comento que quizás no logré actualizar el día miércoles... hoy en la noche viajo de extensión.. creo q en la historia les explique de q se trata... tengo que cumplir ciertas horas de servicio a la comunidad cada semestre.. en verdad es una bonita experiencia. Lo malo es q en las comunidades no hay internet...! y regresó el día viernes... tengo q acabar el cap 64, pero tnego un pequeño capítulo reservado para el prox domingo :) Q tengan una linda semana.. gracias x sus reviews, recomendaciones y sigan dejandolos xfa :P Espero sus comentarios sobre sus expectativas, recomendaciones.. si no puedo actualizar el miércoles lo haré el próximo domingo ;) Nos leemos luego -3 MILET AVANCE: Sabía que tenía a Darío. Sabía que había salido adelante, pero yo seguía siendo masoquista, seguía buscándola a pesar de que acepté el hecho de que no volvería. Ella ya había reconstruido su vida como me dijo que lo haría y sabía que algún momento tendría que decirle adiós, pero me negaba a dejarla ir sin que sepa todo lo que siento.[Chapter 63] Capítulo 63 *3 MESES DESPUÉS* Sentí unos labios sobre los míos. Sonreí. Amaba despertar con ella a mi lado, luego de soñar con ella. Mi vida estaba llena de ella. - ¿Alguien despertó de buen humor hoy? – y ahí estaba. Volví a la realidad cuando reconocí esa voz. No era Alex. Esta era mi realidad. Frote mis ojos con mis puños para que se acostumbraran mejor a la luz. Ahí estaba Claudia desnuda sobre mí. Estábamos envueltos por las sábanas de su cama. Había venido a visitarla en Madrid y como lo más natural de una pareja terminamos durmiendo juntos y como cada mañana luego de que teníamos sexo me sentía como la mierda. Ella se acercó más y me besó. Le correspondí. Ella era una buena chica. Era hermosa, era cálida, humilde, especial. Pero no era Alex. Nunca nadie sería ella y de alguna manera por fin estaba entendiendo. Pero eso no quería decir que había logrado sacarla de mi corazón. Ella siempre sería dueña de esa parte de mi vida, pero de alguna manera tenía que seguir. Le enviaba miles de mensajes, de canciones, pero nunca me respondía y eso me dañaba a un más. Sabía que los leía, el bendito whatsapp me lo decía y eso era aún peor. Sabía que tenía a Darío. Sabía que había salido adelante, pero yo seguía siendo masoquista, seguía buscándola a pesar de que acepté el hecho de que no volvería. Ella ya había reconstruido su vida como me dijo que lo haría y sabía que algún momento tendría que decirle adiós, pero me negaba a dejarla ir sin que sepa todo lo que siento. Salí a pasear con mi novia. Mañana estaría de regresó en Los Ángeles con ella. Esa era nuestra relación que de cierto modo me agradaba no tener que fingir todo el tiempo que estaba a gusto con ella a mi lado porque no era así. Me sentía un maldito manipulador. Pero ahora ella vendría conmigo por unos días. Cuando llegamos a mi departamento empecé a desempacar antes de meterme a dormir en la cama. Claudia se instaló en la habitación de huéspedes. No le había gustado la idea pero le dije que solo quería que dejara ahí sus cosas. Le aseguré que dormiríamos juntos. Lo haríamos, pero no en mi cama. No en donde había compartido con Alex, donde habíamos hecho el amor por última vez. Claro que eso no le dije a mi novia. Abrí uno de mis cajones para guardar mis camisas y encontré algo que me trajo recuerdos dolorosos. Su ropa. La tomé en mis manos y la acerqué a mi rostro. Aún tenía su aroma, esa fragancia que extrañaba. Volví a guardarla antes de que las lágrimas y los sentimientos oscuros me envuelvan. Ya estaba cansado de sufrir, de llorar y de lamentarme. Nada solucionará lo que pasó, podría lamentarme todo lo que quisiera pero nada me haría recuperarla. Me tumbé en mi cama y estire mi mano hacia el pequeño cajón alcanzando ese pequeño anillo. Lo tomé con delicadeza y me puse a inspeccionarlo. Le había hecho millones de promesas, había planeado un futuro juntos y las circunstancias dañaron lo más bonito que había tenido en mi vida. Infinito. Era la cantidad de amor que sentía por ella. Claudia entró en mi habitación vestida con su muy ligera pijama. Coloqué el anillo rápidamente en su lugar de nuevo. Ella no lo notó y se deslizo sobre mí empezando a besarme. Quería perderme en sus besos, quería con todas mi fuerzas amarla y poder hacerle el amor. Pero sabía que no podía. Era sexo. De algún modo salimos de mi habitación y terminamos en la de visitas. Me dejé llevar por sus caricias y nuestra ropa terminó en el piso. Nuestros gemidos rompieron el silencio cuando recorríamos el camino al éxtasis. Ella gemía mi nombre y en lugar de excitarme me hacía más consciente de que no era Alex. Cerré mis ojos y ordené a mi mente recordar su cuerpo. Me perdí ante el recuerdo de su piel, de cada curva de cada caricia y alcancé el clímax con su imagen en mi mente. En el último momento tuve que retener el \"te amo\" que siempre le decía. Casi había olvidada que no era ella a quien acaba de tener en mi cama. Claudia se durmió casi inmediatamente. Se aferró a mi cuerpo pasando una pierna sobre las mías, abrazando mi cuerpo y descansando su cabeza en mi pecho. Se sentía mal. Ese no era su lugar. Espere a que estuviera lo suficientemente dormida y salí de la cama colocándome mi bóxer. Fui hacia la pequeña terraza tomando mi celular en el camino. Me estremecí cuando el frío aire nocturno se sintió en mi piel. Escribí y envié el mensaje antes de que pudiera notar lo que hacía. Mi vida estaba arruinada y tenía que culpar a alguien. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O Mi celular vibró y me despertó de mi sueño. Tarde un momento en darme cuenta que no estaba en mi habitación. Sentí el brazo de mi novio apretarme contra él. Recordé lo que había pasado anoche. Finalmente nos habíamos acostado. Era sexo… y del bueno. Fue una manera de escaparme de mis pensamientos. Perdí mi cabeza cuando llegué al clímax y por un breve instante dejé de pensar en Josh para el siguiente recordarlo intensamente y sentirme mal por desear que hubiera sido él quien me besaba en lugar de Darío. Me convencí de que necesitaba dar este paso con él para poder quitarme a Josh de mi piel pero ahora dudo que haya sido una buena idea. Me sentí tan ruin cuando Darío me dijo lo mucho que me amaba mientras me besaba y se aferraba a mí antes de dormirse. Soy una mala persona. Solo busco lo que me conviene, solo lo uso para mi beneficio y ahora tengo que hacerme cargo de mi estupidez. Quizás algún día llegue a amarlo como lo merece. Tengo que hacerlo. Él se merece que lo haga feliz y que lo amé con total entrega y la misma fuerza con la que me ama. Me estiró para tomar mi celular. Tengo un nuevo mensaje en mi whatsapp. Tomo una bocanada aire antes de leer el nuevo mensaje de Josh. \"Sabes… me arruinaste por completo. No puedo acostarme con nadie sin tener tu recuerdo rondándome ¿cuál es tu secreto? Dímelo porque no sé cómo continuar con mi vida sabiendo que en algún lado estas tú. Cada día me despierto pensando en ti y cada noche me voy a dormir sabiendo que estás en mis sueños. No soy feliz, Alex. No lo soy y necesito desesperadamente tener un motivo para seguir o una forma de lidiar con esto que siento. Te amo princesa. No trato de ocultarlo aunque esté con alguien más. Eres lo mejor que me ha sucedido y no me arrepiento ni un solo segundo de haberte conocido. Me haces una mejor persona y amo quien soy ahora, pero no puedo seguir sufriendo y lamentándome por lo que sucedió. Tú ya me dijiste adiós, me borraste de tu sistema y no volverás. Pero no sé cómo hacer lo mismo. Ayúdame.\" Mi corazón se estrujo al saber que él sufría. No sabía si creerle, no debería pero lo hacía y me sentía como basura. Todo lo que sucedía era mi culpa, aunque quisiera negarlo pero ya no había vuelta atrás. Ya no dañaría a más personas. No podía dejar a Darío solo para arriesgarme a estar con Josh. No solo por Darío, sino también por mí, no volvería a arriesgarme, nunca más. Me había cuestionado la posibilidad de darnos una oportunidad pero con lo que sucedió esta noche ya no podía. Estos días mi orgullo se había escondido y dejo de cegarme, pensé en mi última noche con Josh, había sentido lo mucho que me amaba, nadie podía ser tan buen actor. Pero luego me cegué nuevamente con el dolor. Todo en mí es una locura y montón de confusión. Tal vez decía la verdad, tal vez debería confiar en él. Ahora era tarde. Ya no quería seguir siendo una mala persona. No merecía obtener lo que quería si otras personas sufrían, no podía ser tan egoísta. Mi estómago dio vueltas ante la imagen de Josh acostándose con alguien más. Sé que es hipócrita de mi parte tener esas sensaciones, pero simplemente no puedo evitarlo. Aun lo amo y aun siento celos por imaginar sus manos y sus labios en otra persona. Tenía que encontrar la manera Ahogué el sollozo que se liberaba en mi garganta. Tomé varias bocanadas de aire para tranquilizarme y evitar las lágrimas. Pensé en lo que le respondería. Lo mejor para todos. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O \"Tal vez lo que necesitas es dejarme ir… decir tu adiós. Por tu bien y por el mío tenemos que… avanzar\" Cierta parte de mí estaba feliz por recibir una respuesta de ella, pero mi otra parte se rompía al leer sus palabras. Dolían porque sabía que era verdad, porque yo mismo había pensado en eso, pero saber que ella quiere que me olvide para siempre… que \"avance\" lo hacía real. Y la realidad dolía. \"Tal vez…\" fue lo único que respondí. Ella lo leyó pero no respondió. Tal vez debía hacer lo que me pedía. Tal vez… Estuve días pensando en que hacer. Quería luchar, mi alma me pedía buscar la manera de recuperarla. Me senté en la mesa de un bar con mi amigo Avan. Ambos estábamos brindando por nuestra mala suerte en el amor. Y quizás se nos pasaron un poco los tragos. Pero disfrutamos la velada. Era un bar latino y un sujeto con guitarra empezó a cantar y tan pronto como escuché la letra me derrumbé. (Después de ti – Alejandro Lerner: www_youtube_com/watch?v=XuIPbPFwb6A ) Lloré como un niño porque esa melodía decía exactamente lo que pienso. Me acerqué al sujeto cuando terminó la canción. Tropecé con cada mesa y silla en el camino. Le pedí el nombre de la canción y 5 minutos después la tenía publicado en todas las redes sociales y en un mensaje hacia ella. No lo leía. Necesitaba que lo leyera. Marque su número, no me importaba si la despertará de su dulce sueño. Le diría que la amaba y que regresaré por ella. No importa con quien este o que tan cabezota es. Ella me ama tanto como yo a ella y haré todo lo que sea necesario para que me acepte de nuevo. Volví a marcar cuando no contesto mis dos primeras llamadas, pero no me preparé para escuchar cuando descolgaron el teléfono. - Hooola – fue un bostezo de una voz masculina que reconocí casi inmediatamente. Mi corazón se detuvo. Bueno no literalmente porque aun lo sentía latiendo en mi pecho, pero de alguna manera se detuvo y se destrozó como si fuera de cristal. - Bueno? – la voz de Darío resonaba en la bocina. Tal vez ella había olvidado su teléfono y él lo tenía. - Mmmm ¿quién es? – y fue ahí cuando mi alma murió. Su voz a través de la bocina. Ella estaba durmiendo con él. Ella hizo el amor con él. – ¿Hola? No soporté y corté la llamada antes de arrojar mi teléfono lejos. Me senté en la vereda y lloré aún más que antes. Entendí porque quería que la deje ir. Ella había dejado de amarme y ahora lo quería a él. Ella era feliz con él y yo opacaba su felicidad. Ella quería que yo avance porque… porque era ella. Ella no podía ser feliz si alguien no lo era. Ella quería que yo sea feliz. Pero no entendía que yo no podía serlo sin ella. Pero esta vez no dejaría que ella se sienta culpable por mí. Dejaría que sea feliz con él y avanzaré de algún modo. Hooooolaa ? alguien ahí? :( ya nadie comenta y eso q he actualizado lo mas pronto q pude :/ Ya regresé de mi viaje y ya estoy de vacaciones... ahora podré escribir un poca mas centrada (eso espero) ojala pueda inspirarme y actualizar mas veces a la semana :P ¿que les pareció? ¿creen q estoy siendo cruel con Josh de esta manera?

Espero q las sigan dejando... tengo las ideas claras de que va a suceder aunq aun me pelo con las situaciones.. pero bueno gracias x quienes estan pendientes de la publicaciones..! nos vemos el miércoles...! -z3 MILET AVANCE: - Eso no te da motivos para humillarme – si las miradas mataran… - sabía que la querías, pero pensé que querías olvidarla. Me prometiste intentarlo, Josh. Estoy harta de que me uses, sé que yo te lo permití pero porque pensaba que querías avanzar y luego pensé que me querías, pero no… prefieres seguir hundiéndote en tu miseria por esa… por esa zorra estúpida que se revuelca con otro.[Chapter 64] Capítulo 64 Josh. Él había llamado y Darío había contestado. No sabía que pensar, no podía volver a dormir. Darío había caído casi enseguida en un sueño profundo. No le dio importancia a una llamada errónea. Eso le dije. Salí de su cama y de su casa sin ser detectada. Llegué a mi solitaria casa. Estaba ya acostumbrada a estar sola los fines de semana. Eso me servía para pensar. Abrí el mensaje que me había enviado y abrí el link. Como otras veces había logrado romperme el alma con otra canción. Pero ya había tomado mi decisión y no me iba a echar para atrás. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - No puedo creer que me hagas esto, Josh – entendía perfectamente el disgusto de Claudia. La hice el centro de los chismes de farándula cuando publiqué esa bendita canción. Todos supieron que era para Alex. - Lo siento, Clau. Sé que no es excusa pero estaba borracho. - Eso no te da motivos para humillarme – si las miradas mataran… - sabía que la querías, pero pensé que querías olvidarla. Me prometiste intentarlo, Josh. Estoy harta de que me uses, sé que yo te lo permití pero porque pensaba que querías avanzar y luego pensé que me querías, pero no… prefieres seguir hundiéndote en tu miseria por esa… por esa zorra estúpida que se revuelca con otro. - Basta – le grité – No te atrevas a hablar mal de ella. - Es la maldita verdad, Josh. - Si tanto te molesta… puedes irte – lo dije con mi voz calmada – no necesitas que te siga usando y haciéndote pasar un mal rato. - ¿Es eso lo que quieres, Josh? ¿Quieres que me vaya? Asentí. Estaba haciendo daño a una persona inocente. Decidí dejar de ser egoísta. Claudia tomó sus cosas y se fue. Solo escuché el portazo que anunció su partida. Era lo mejor. Y ahora haría lo mejor para ella. Le diría \"Adios\". Busqué una hoja de papel y empecé a escribir. Escuchaba la música de mi computador que había obtenido de ella. Había canciones de todo tipo, en todo género e idioma. Mientras escribía escuche una y decidí enviarla. Era antigua en cierto modo. Recordé escucharla una vez en su casa en la radio de su mamá. Pero sería un aviso. \"Espero que seas feliz… siempre estaré para ti (Un buen perdedor – Franco de Vita: www_youtube_com/watch?v=sbwVfGzsfnk ) \" Espera su respuesta. Pude ver la vece que en la aplicación apreció \"escribiendo\" pero nunca me llego nada. Quizá ya no tenía nada que decir. O quizás sí… - Alex – susurré cuando contesté su llamada. - Hola Josh – también susurró. Un silencio largo se extendió. - ¿Es ese tu adiós? - No – sonreí – no es mi adiós… aún. - ¿Aún? Así que… decidiste dejarlo. - No es algo que tenga que elegir. Pero tengo que hacerlo. – era un estúpido, estaba haciéndole sentir culpable y eso era exactamente lo que no quería – Lo siento. No quiero que te sientas mal por mí. Solo… solo quiero que seas feliz y si quieres que avance, que olvide todo lo que vivimos y que te diga \"Adiós\" pue así será. Solo si me prometes que estoy haciendo lo correcto y que con eso serás feliz. Verdaderamente feliz. Más de lo que yo pude hacerte sentir. No me respondió de inmediato. Pasaron segundos o quizás minutos donde solo escuchamos la respiración del otro. Parte de mí, esa parte egoísta quería que se negara y me dijera que no podía ser feliz sin mí. Justo como yo sentía. - Lo prometo – y otra vez esa sensación de que mi corazón se detuvo. Corté la llamada porque necesitaba respirar. Necesitaba planear mi vida, buscar la manera de avanzar. Continúe escribiendo aquella carta. Sería mi definitivo adiós. Diferentes sentimientos me invadieron mientras las palabras eran plasmadas en papel. Sentí ira, desilusión, amor, añoranza. No podía creer que todo se acabe de esta manera y yo era quien diría la última palabra. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - La pequeña Ana es preciosa – comentó mi mami mientras llegábamos a la casa. Fernanda había dado a luz a una muy hermosa pequeña de piel blanca y cabello rubio como su madre pero con ojos marrones y rizos alborotados como su padre. Era preciosa. Mi nueva niña mimada. La relación entre mis amigos no podía ser mejor. Su vida sería dura pero se quería. Pensar que a otras parejas un embarazo los aleja y a ellos los ha juntado. Me sentía emocionada por esa pequeña. En cierto modo envidiaba a mi amiga por su suerte. Tenía problemas, muchos, pero tenía a un gran hombre a su lado y ahora tenía una familia a quien amaba y a quienes a amaban. No quiero decir que no tengo personas que me quieren pero de cierto modo envidio lo que tiene. - Es la combinación perfecta de ambos. Fui a mi cocina por un vaso de jugo. Estaba sedienta. Habíamos ido a visitar a Fernanda en su casa, hoy le dieron el alta en el hospital. - Hay algo aquí para ti – gritó mi mami desde la sala. Fui hacia ella y me entregó una carta. La tomé extrañada. Nunca había recibido una. Verifiqué la dirección y llegué a la conclusión de que era de Josh. Parte de mí no quería abrirla porque sabía que me haría daño, pero él había prometido dejarme ir. Tal vez esto era su adiós. Trate de obviarla todo el día. Por la noche me senté en la terraza mientras contemplaba la luna. Todos habían ido a dormir, necesitaba ese tiempo a solas para leerla. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O – O Hola, mi amor… Quizás la palabra ahora te disguste, pero para mí es importante que sepas que te amo. ¿Te extraño… lo sabes? A veces me gustaría preguntártelo, pero en mi interior sé que lo sabes… Todas las noches pienso en ti antes de dormir y pido a esa persona que un día me concedió el milagro de conocerte hacerte feliz que me conceda otro porque sé que fuiste feliz conmigo. Desde que te fuiste me duele el corazón, me duele el alma, siento como si hubiera corrido 20 kilómetros por una cuesta en un día de sol porque me duele todo el cuerpo, no respiro bien, no duermo bien, no vivo bien. Solo quiero que vuelvas…quiero volver a tenerte y aprovechar cada segundo que di por sentado, pesando que siempre estarías ahí para mí. A veces me es muy difícil estar aquí sin ti, pero quiero demostrarme que puedo ser alguien más después de ti, no quiero depender de ti, pero… Te extraño, te necesito, me hace falta a veces que me abraces y que me digas que todo va a estar bien. Me volví tan adicto a tenerte que te seguiría hasta el Infierno… aunque creo que ya estoy en él. Estoy rodeado de personas con buena intenciones que dicen: \"La vida debe continuar, todo pasará\" no tienen ni mierda de idea. No puedo \"continuar\" o \"avanzar\" más sin ti de lo que podría si la mitad de mi cuerpo fuera cortado. Mi vida, mi corazón y mi alma están unidos a las tuyas. Mi vida en sí depende de la tuya. Me muevo, respiro, sigo pero realmente no vivo sin ti. Todo lo que mantiene mi corazón latiendo es la maldita esperanza de que algún día tal vez vuelvas. Sabes… Nunca pensé que me enamoraría realmente, muchas veces veía a personas sufrir por amor, por relaciones que no les llevaban a ningún lugar, por incompatibilidad y cosas así. Pero lo que realmente quise tener fue lo que veía en mis padres. Ellos eran diferentes pero se aceptaban así como eran. Así que un día me formulé: Algún día conoceré a una chica, que sabrá como soy, como duermo y como se ve mi cara cada mañana; sabrá que puedo ser muy estúpido y pendejo a veces, que programas amo ver y que música disfruto; sabrá cómo me río, mis gustos, mis defectos, mis virtudes, lo enojón que soy, lo celoso y posesivo; conocerá todos y cada uno de mis defectos y amará cada parte de mí imperfección y yo la amaré de la misma manera… ¿te preguntaras si encontré eso? Lo hice. Encontré eso y mucho más en ti. Alex. Hasta tu nombre es perfecto. Amo cada parte de ti, incluso cuando eras necia. Amo esa tenacidad de llevarme la contra. Podría llenar millones de hojas escribiendo cada cosa de ti que amo, pero no tendría sentido. Estoy desnudando mi alma por ti. Te estoy diciendo mis sueños, mis anhelos y mis temores. Cuando te fuiste de Denver, la primera vez, temía no verte nunca más. Me di cuenta que me había enamorado, me había enamorado perdidamente de una chica de rubios alborotados y ojos de color café que con cada gesto ponía mi mundo de cabeza. Y también te había perdido y había sido verdaderamente miserable. Pero había vuelto a encontrarte y te había sentido tan cerca de mí, lo que era aún peor para mi corazón enamorado. Había llegado al cielo cuando me dijiste que también me amas. Había conocido la verdadera felicidad contigo. Jamás podría borrar el olor de tu piel, ni la dulce tortura de tu tacto. Jamás podría olvidar como era perderme en ti mientras hacíamos el amor. Nunca pensé que nuestra historia se convirtiera en una novela pesimista ¿Por qué dos personas que se aman no pueden estar juntas? ¿Por qué tenía que ser todo tan difícil? ¿Por qué tenía que pasarnos esto a nosotros? Son tantas preguntas que nunca tendrán respuesta. Nunca pensé en perderte. No me había preparado para el dolor que vendría con ello. Y nunca podría hacerlo. En mi interior siempre serás mía, así como yo seré tuyo para siempre, aunque saber eso no aliviaba mi dolor. Me arrepiento de las cosas que no te he dicho y de las pocas que si dije, me arrepiento de no haberte contado lo que paso con Shannon antes de que te enteraras de esa manera. Pero sobre todo me arrepiento de dejarte ir. Sé que tienes a alguien y aunque me duela admitirlo sé que podría hacerte feliz. Esa es tu manera de seguir al igual que yo. Quizás pienses que quiero llenar ese espacio que dejaste… es así… trato de hacer eso. Me miento a mí mismo cada día. Sé que no hay la más mínima probabilidad de que eso suceda pero no puedo ni quiero dejar de luchar… pero tú no me dejas. ¿Sabes qué? Ahora me doy cuentas que no soy yo el único culpable de esto. Nunca podría haberte engañado, eras… eres mi vida. No lo hice en pleno uso de mis facultades, pero ¿de qué me sirve eso ahora? Tú ya me juzgaste y emitiste tu veredicto. Fuiste TÚ quien no nos dio una oportunidad. Fuiste TÚ quien decidió que yo te engañaba. Me dijiste que si no había confianza no podía haber una relación y que tú habías perdido esa confianza en mí. Mi pregunta es ¿Cuándo pasó eso? ¿Cuándo dejaste de confiar en mí? ¿Por qué no creíste en mis palabras? ¿Qué hice para perder eso que teníamos? No confiabas en mí antes de que sucediera lo de Shannon, porque si lo hubieras hecho no estaríamos en esta situación. No sé lo que hice para merecer esto… es tarde para obtener respuestas porque sé que no me las darás y no insistiré en ello. No trato de culparte, solo trato de entender y decirte lo que pienso. No puedo dejar de amarte, no sé cómo lo haces. No sé si solo soy yo el que no puede pasar la página o simplemente no me amaste de la misma forma que yo a ti. No quiero imaginar eso… quiero convencerme de que lo que tuvimos fue REAL, porque para mí lo fue. Te amé, con la misma intensidad, con todo mí ser. Aun lo hago. Dijiste tu ADIOS. Escuché la canción y dolió. Mucho. Dolió porque no entendía como nuestra relación de me fue de las manos. Quisiera abrir los ojos y descubrir que todo esto es un mal sueño. Quisiera despertar contigo a mi lado, quisiera ser tu \"vivieron felices por siempre\", quisiera… Este es mi ADIÓS, dejaré que vueles lejos de mí aunque eso me esté destruyendo… solo quisiera que regreses a mí. Siempre estaré dispuesto a tenerte conmigo de nuevo… Adiós, mi amor… Se feliz. P.D: ( Intocable – Alex Syntek: www_youtube_com/watch?v=xYW1Q8nyU-4 ) escúchala, es la última. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O – O Mi pecho apretaba y mi respiración quedo atrapada. Mientras escuchaba la canción que había enviado. Mis manos temblaban y mis lágrimas caían sobre el escrito dejando la tinta borrosa en su lugar. Lloré. Lloro por todo lo que he perdido. Lloro por la ira en sus palabras. Lloro porque se rindió. Él dijo que lucharía por mí y sé que soy injusta porque yo mismo lo alejé pero no puedo evitar que mi corazón duela. Lloro por los recuerdos… por el día en que lo conocí y me enamoré perdidamente. Lloro por que la chica que conoció ese día ya no está. Lloro porque no sé qué hacer con la persona que queda. Lloro por un futuro incierto y una vida que reconstruir. FIN FIN? Ok no es el fin de la novela pero si de la primera parte. Holaaaa actualicé antes...! ¿que les pareció? los cap ya no son tan largos pero espero q les haya gustado. nunca pensé que podría ser tan difícil escribir un carta pero tarde mas de 3 semanas en dejarla lista..! espero que haya trasmitido lo que en verdad quería. La primera canción me la sugirió mi mami y la segunda me ayudo a inspirarme mientras escribía. Ahora en verdad espero sus opiniones sobre que sucederá. tengo muchas ideas revueltas y no me caería mal unas pocas mas...! Gracias por haber leído hasta aquí. en verdad no saben lo importante que ha sido para mi saber que siguen la historia y leen lo que escribo.. y también que perdonen mis faltas de ortografía que son consecuencia de mi flojería al no revisar antes de subir :P Como dedicatoria de esta historia va para mis 2 mejores amigas, aunque una de ella no esté con nosotros se que amaría la historia tanto como su hermana.. y se que ella la ama ;) Nos leemos luego - :) MILET (Solo x esta vez no habrá AVANCE)[Chapter 65] Capítulo 65 *9 MESES DESPUES* - No puedo creer que estemos aquí – dijo Fernanda metiendo la última caja a nuestro nuevo departamento. -Pues créelo rubia – dijo Santy abrazándola desde atrás – Estaremos aquí por un largo tiempo. - Extraño mucho a nuestra pequeña – dijo mi amiga – estoy feliz de estar aquí y sé que es por una buena razón pero dejar a mi pequeña me rompió el alma. Peter nos había encontrado un departamento cómodo muy cerca a nuestras universidades. Estábamos mudándonos porque en apenas 3 días empezaríamos todos nuestros posgrados y maestrías. Gracias al dinero que me dejó Kristin pude pagar mi posgrado sin deudas como tenía planeado hacerlo y también el de mis amigos. Santy y Fer se negaron pero tuve que buscar maneras de convencerles. Como me nombraron la madrina de Ana me valí de eso para asegurarles que sería lo mejor para el futuro de su pequeña si ellos estudiaban. Ofrecieron pagarme todo algún día, les dije que aceptaría eso si ellos aceptaban mi ayuda ahora. Los 3 íbamos a Harvard. En cuanto a Darío él consiguió una beca para su maestría en Ingeniería y Arquitectura en la Universidad de Boston. Estoy tan feliz de que todos estemos aquí. - Tranquila, el tiempo pasará volando. Parece que recién fue ayer cuando nos graduamos de la preparatoria. - Ya verán que mi pequeña sobrina estará muy bien sin ustedes. Tiene unos abuelos muy consentidores – dijo Darío abrazándome también. - No sé ustedes pero yo estoy realmente cansada – dijo Fer. - Pues mejor nos vamos a la cama – aseguró su esposo sonriéndole – tenemos que estrenar nuestra nueva habitación. - No quiero saber lo que harán – grité mientras iba a la cocina por un poco de agua y un ibuprofeno. Tenía un poco de dolor de cabeza. Posiblemente por el viaje, el ajetreo y el cambio de horario. Cuando regresé la pareja feliz había desaparecido y Darío contemplaba su maleta que estaba en medio de la sala. El departamento tenía 3 habitaciones. Obviamente Fer y Santy iban a compartir una y se suponía que las otra dos eran para Darío y yo. Sabía que era la hora de dar un gran paso. Sé que viviremos juntos pero no es lo mismo que compartir habitación. - ¿Tu habitación o la mía? – pregunté. - ¿Qué? – pregunto curioso. - ¿Qué habitación prefieres que usemos? ¿La tuya o la mía? Sinceramente me gusta más la mía. Tiene una hermosa vista del parque. - ¿Hablas en serio? – Pregunto animado- ¿Quieres que vivamos juntos? - En realidad vamos a vivir juntos de todas maneras, pero si lo que estas preguntando es si quiero que tú y yo compartamos habitación la respuesta es sí. No creo haber visto una sonrisa tan grande en su rostro alguna vez. Me tomó entre sus brazos y besó con fuerza. Respondí a su beso con la misma pasión, después de todo esto me hacía feliz también. - Vaya, gracias señorita. Hmmm, creo que tienes un poco de fiebre. Me temo que voy a tener que recetar reposo en cama inmediatamente – me dijo con su voz coqueta y un destello malvado en su mirada. Me eché a reír por sus ocurrencias y envolví mis brazos en su cuello – Eso probablemente debió ser lo más cursi que alguna vez he oído. - ¡Oye! ¡Pensé que era uno de mis mejores trabajos! – Se alejó de mí y se quitó su camiseta lanzándola a mi cara, agarró su maleta y empezó a ir hacia nuestra habitación – Bueno, yo voy a seguir las órdenes del médico, incluso si tú no lo haces. Pero si decides ser una buena chica tendrás recompensa. Ante tal invitación nadie podría negarse. Fui tras él. Hicimos el amor toda esa noche. Ambos compartíamos la misma pasión y entrega. Éramos buenos juntos. Este era el comienzo de nuestra nueva vida. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - ¿Y conseguiste alguien que te guste? – gritó Avan en medio de todo el ruido de la fiesta. - La verdad es que aquella de allá – apunte con mi vaso de ron hacia la morena sentada en un taburete 4 puestos más allá. - ¿Hablas en serio? – me sorprendí con su pregunta. No encontraba lo malo en la chica. Era ardiente. Le di una mirada de intriga y él prosiguió: - Veamos, es morena, con rizos enmarcando su cara. Cabello castaño oscuro y ojos marrones. ¿No te recuerda a alguien? Porque a mí me parece que estás buscando la versión de tu exnovia para follártela. Fue un golpe a mi ego. Tenía razón. Era la viva imagen de Al…. De ella. Sacudí mi cabeza para despejar mis pensamientos. Ella no tenía nada que ver en mi atracción hacia esa chica. Avan era un paranoico. - Vamos amigo. Yo ya superé todo lo que tiene que ver con ella. - Si como no – sarcasmo – es por eso que ni siquiera puedes pronunciar su nombre. Otro golpe directo a mi ego. Le di una mirada mordaz y me acerqué a la morena quien me aceptó con los brazos abiertos. De alguna manera terminamos en su departamento. Ni siquiera llegamos a su habitación y terminamos follando sobre la alfombra de su recibidor. Cuando me perdí en la sensación del orgasmo grité un nombre. No fue hasta que la chica me preguntó quién era \"Alex\" con un rostro lleno de furia que me di cuenta lo estúpido que fui. No solo por haberla nombrado si no por el hecho de que no había podido superarla. Me había estado mintiendo a mí mismo todo este tiempo. No quería admitirlo, Avan tenía razón. No podía olvidarla, ni siquiera podía decir su nombre sin que mi corazón duela. Tuve que largarme de ese lugar antes de que la morena me lanzara un zapato y antes de que mi alma se derrumbara y empezara a llorar ante el recuerdo de la persona que más he querido en esta vida. No podía superarla ni avanzar. Ese amor tan grande que aun siento me llevaría a mi propia destrucción y aunque trate de evitarlo u ocultarlo pareciera que el sentimiento ha crecido como una mala enfermedad, sin necesidad de alimentarlo. La odio por haberme hecho amarla así y me odio por no poder dejarlo de hacer. Hooolaa... lamento no haber actualizado ayer, mi internet se volvió loco.. quería darles este pequeño cap x San Valentín :) ¿Que les pareció? se que es corto pero espero q les agrade.

Nos leemos luego :) -z3 Milet AVANCE: No puedo decirle por qué no quiero ir, en verdad no soportaría verlo, puede que haya pasado más de un año pero aún me duele. No me malinterpreten. Amo a mi novio pero sé que aún tengo cierto sentimientos por él ¿rabia? ¿ira? ¿dolor? no lo sé pero no sé cómo se comportará mi corazón el tenerlo tan cerca.[Chapter 66] Capítulo 66 *3 MESES DESPUÉS* - Me tengo que ir pequeña. No me mires así. Solo serán 3 días no me extrañaras. - Claro que te extrañaré. No me gusta que viajes tanto. Me tienes muy abandonada – le dije a mi novio. Sabía que no podía evitar que se vaya pero odiaba que este lejos de mí. De cierto modo me volví adicta a su presencia, todo iba bien cuando él estaba a mi lado. - Tú sabes que si no fuera porque tengo que ir me quedaría contigo. Mis noches sin ti a mi lado son demasiado largas, Princesa. Tenía razón. Tenía sus responsabilidades pero odiaba que tenga que viajar. Su maestría en ingienería lo obligaba a viajar por todo el país en sus pasantías que eran parte de su materia de diseños modernos y contemporáneos. Últimamente me sentía abandonada. Algunas veces era incomodo salir con mis amigos, todos tenían novios y yo iba de violinista. - Sabes que te quiero, Alex. Eres todo lo que necesito para estar completo. No me lo hagas más difícil, de por sí, una parte de mí se queda contigo. - Lo lamento – le digo haciendo un puchero – pero no puedo evitar extrañarte tanto. Te amo, pequeño. No anticipé su reacción pero se acercó y poso sus dulces labios sobre los míos. Fue un beso delicado pero al mismo tiempo ansioso. Cuando se alejó, por falta de aire, pude ver una de sus grandes sonrisas en su rostro. - Y yo te amo más de lo que puedes imaginar – con que era eso. Traté de hacer memoria y me di cuenta que era la primera vez que decía esas palabras. Y no me arrepentía, lo amaba con todo mi corazón. Él era mi vida y no pudiera sentirme completa sin él a mi lado. - Debes irte o note ataré a mi cama. - Eso es algo que me gustaría – Me guiñó - Te amo – dijo contra mis labios en un último beso de despedida. Tomó su pequeña maleta y salió. Me vestí y salí al encuentro de una persona especial. Hacía mucho que no lo veía y aunque me trae recuerdos, tengo que enfrentarlo. No puedo esconderme de mis problemas por siempre. - ¡CONNOR! – Chilló de emoción abrazando a mi amigo. - Pequeña, te extrañé demasiado. No puedo creer que estés aquí – envuelta en sus brazos me levantó del suelo y giró conmigo. - Eres fuerte, niño – le dije mientras entrabamos en la heladería. - Tengo 19 años, la misma edad que tú cuando te conocí, ya no deberías tratarme como un niño. - Vamos – me senté frente a él – Sabes que eres como un hermano menor para mí. - Y tú eres mi molesta hermana mayor – en ese momento llegó la camarera y tomó nuestra orden. En seguida nos trajo nuestros helados. De mora para Connor y de Oreo para mí**. - ¿Qué tal la mudanza? ¿Cómo te sientes viviendo aquí? - Fue ajetreado – le respondí – pero es una experiencia nueva. Antes extrañaba a todo mundo y eso que tenía a Peter y a Kristin. Ahora extraño a mis padres, sí, pero tener a mis amigos conmigo lo hace fantabuloso. Es como esas típicas ideas de adolescente en las que vives con tus amigos sin supervisión. - Genial, dales saludos de mi parte – asiento. Su mirada se torna seria - ¿Cómo… van las cosas con Darío? No entiendo por qué le cuesta tocar el tema. Quizás solo me imagino su incomodidad. – Demasiado bien. Vivir juntos nos ha unido aún más, si eso es posible. - Ya veo que eres feliz. – definitivamente su tono melancólico no viene de mi imaginación. - Si… lo soy – le digo insegura. No porque no sea feliz si no por su actitud. Lo miro inquisitivamente preguntando con mi mirada la razón de su actitud. - Lo siento. Me prometí mismo no tocar el tema, pero… es que… - se sonroja y me mira apenado – estoy feliz de que tú lo seas. Sabes que te quiero y me importas mucho. Pero también quiero a mi hermano y me duele que él no haya conseguido lo que tú… De alguna manera mi corazón se estremece y se llena de diversos sentimientos. Todos contradictorios. Luchan dentro de mí y esta vez gana la tristeza - ¿él no es feliz? Niega con la cabeza. Parte de mí se siente mal por ellos, pero otra parte no cree esas palabras. - Sé que es su culpa y créeme que pienso que se lo tiene merecido por haber sido una canalla, pero sé que no puede olvidarte, sé que te ama. Mi aliento queda atrapado ante esas palabras. No sé qué pensar pero estoy segura de que no creo eso. Yo superé lo nuestro, él pudo hacerlo de la misma manera ¿verdad? - No fue solo su culpa - las palabras brotaron de mí sin siquiera pensarlas. Connor me mira con curiosidad y expectativa y ni yo mismo se lo que he dicho. Buen si sé. Muchas veces cuando mis sentimientos se alejan y me dejan penar con cabeza fría me cuestionó todo. Muchas veces llegó a la conclusión que fui la culpable de todo por desconfiar de él. Nunca me dio razones para hacerlo y sé que me amo. Lo supe la última vez que hicimos el amor. Y son esos momentos cuando moría por llamarlo y pedirle una nueva oportunidad hasta que muchas razones para no hacerlo se hacían presente: 1) Darío, no podía arriesgarme a dejarlo por algo que mi corazón quería; él me amaba y me había recibido con los brazos abiertos a pesar de todo, 2) Rabia, cuando recordaba que Josh sí me dio razones para desconfiar; me usó como un maldito escalón para su fama y yo era una estúpida por haber confiado en él y por seguir pensando en lo que teníamos. Pero eso era antes. Ahora amo a mi novio y lo que tenía con Josh está totalmente superado. - Llegué hace 3 meses ¿Por qué hasta ahora te veo, muchachón?- un cambio de tema para aligerar el ambiente. - Aunque te cueste creer soy un niño de mamá. No deja que abandoné Kentucky, a menos que sea con ella, con papá o Josh – creo que hice una mueca de dolor al escuchar su nombre pero Connor continuó – así que cuando mi hermano me invitó a esta premier tomé la oportunidad de venir aquí. Tenía que verte pequeña. - ¿Debería sentirme alagada? – Reímos – Es bueno verte. ¿No le dijiste a nadie, verdad?- tenía miedo de que Josh supiera que estoy cerca. Parte de mí creía en las palabras de Connor, probablemente Josh aun me ama y me buscaría. No quiero que vuelva a interferir en mi vida. - Tranquila. Puedes confiar en mí, aunque por más que no diga nada no podemos ir en contra del destino. - ¿Destino? ¿De qué mierda hablas? - Puedes pensar que soy un cursi pero creo que cuando 2 personas están destinadas a estar juntos el mundo se vuelve un pañuelo lleno de posibilidades para forjar el camino que ha trazado para ellos. - Vaya que si eres cursi – le sonreí. Sabía lo que estaba diciendo, y me estaba de alguna manera afectando. Cosa que no debería. Cambiamos de tema y hablamos de cosas triviales y divertidas. Para el medio día almorzamos juntos y nos despedimos. Prometí ir a visitarle en Kentucky cuando pudiera al igual que él intentaría venir por mí. Pasé la tarde con Fernanda ayudando a empaquetar la ropa que había comprado para su pequeña y que enviaría por correo. Sonó el timbre y Alyson, nuestra nueva mejor amiga estadounidense, llegó con una inesperada proposición. - Tenemos que ir a la premier de hoy. Es lo mejor que ha sucedido en Boston en años. Y quizás es la última vez que veamos a todo el set de sinsajo reunido. Fernanda prácticamente escupió la bebida que estaba tomando y mi respuesta llego un poco deprisa y con un tono de voz grosero. - No. No puedo decirle por qué no quiero ir, en verdad no soportaría verlo, puede que haya pasado más de un año pero aún me duele. No me malinterpreten. Amo a mi novio pero sé que aún tengo cierto sentimientos por él ¿rabia? ¿ira? ¿dolor? no lo sé pero no sé cómo se comportará mi corazón el tenerlo tan cerca. - Vamos Alex, por favor, tienes que ir conmigo a la premier, además amas Los Juegos del Hambre, que mejor que ir a ver a todos sus actores y te aseguro que mis hermanos nos tienen reservados unos puestos excelentes. -No puedo Alyson, en verdad, Darío regresa en un par de días y no le avisé… - además dudo que le gustaría la idea. -Por Dios Alex, no me vengas con excusas tontas. Tú no pides permiso a nadie, vamos Alex, podrás conocer a Jenn, yo sé que amas su trabajo. -Y pensar que pudiste ser su amiga – dijo Fernanda en español. -Cállate Fernanda – le respondí también en español. -Pues más vale que inventes una buena excusa o mejor vayas. -Odio que hagan eso, saben que no hablo español – Alyson me mira con su expresión suplicante – Por favor Alex, te juro que si me acompañas te deberé cualquier favor, te cubriré el turno que quieras no importa si es navidad. -Está bien, voy pero me deberás un gran favor. – acepté porque no podía pensar en ninguna maldita excusa. y además ella estaba usando esa carita de perrito atropellado que sabía usar para que yo no pueda negarme a nada. -Espero que se diviertan chicas, consigan autógrafos y fotos – Fernanda tiene un turno en la clínica. -Lo haremos – chilla Alyson, en verdad admiro su entusiasmo – Ahora vamos a arreglarnos, si estamos bonitas tal vez Josh o Sam se enamoren de nosotras, ya sabes amor a primera vista. -Eso no lo dudes, quisiera ver la reacción de Josh al verlas – Dice Fernanda con un tono sarcástico, y se caya al ver mi mirada mordaz. -¿de qué habla? -De nada, Fer siempre hace comentarios estúpidos, ahora vamos y ayúdame a ver que ropa debería usar. Dos horas más tarde estábamos arregladas y en camino a la Premier. Una multitud de personas estaban alrededor del teatro, lo que me alivia porque muy difícilmente alguien me reconocerá entre tanta gente, y con ese \"alguien\" me refiero a Josh. -Mis hermanos están adelante, Vamos – toma mi mano – tenemos que llegar a ellos. Caminos en medio de la multitud, algunos nos veían enojados por avanzar adelante. Mi alivio se desvaneció cuando llegamos a la barra de seguridad junto a la alfombra roja, no era lo que había planeado. -Alex, ellos son mis hermanos Paul y Luke – dos chicos altos, musculoso, rubios y muy bien parecidos me saludan – y mi primo Clapton – me señala a otro chico con la misma contextura, obviamente son familia. -Mucho gusto. -Igualmente – respondieron todos al unísono, luego de una larga conversación y bromas entramos en confianza, son buenos chicos y mus graciosos, es así como me enteré que están aquí desde la noche anterior, todo para complacer a su pequeña Alyson admiradora-compulsiva-de-las-estrellas-de-Hollywood. -Miren ya va empezar, allá esta Willow y Sam – la multitud grita cuando los actores empiezan su recorrida por la alfombra roja y obviamente yo al ser una gran fan también estoy emocionada. Logré tener autógrafos de Sam, Liam, de la misma Suzanne Collins, y espero poder tener de Jenn ahora que la veo acercarse por la alfombra. -Jenn, aquí por favor – chilla Alyson a mi lado, estuvo a punto de reventar mi tímpano, obviamente Jenn se acercó a nosotras, Alyson empuja su libreta de autógrafo a ella. Se ve una chica muy dulce en persona, la admiro por su trabajo y por tener los pies sobre la tierra a pesar de su fama - ¿Para quién el autógrafo? – pregunta Jenn con una gran sonrisa. -Para Mí, Alyson, tu mayor admiradora – no sé porque siento un poco de vergüenza ajena y Jenn se ríe por el entusiasmo de mi amiga, le devuelve la libreta y Alyson finge desmayarse de la emoción. Jenn toma mi libreta y me pregunta: -¿Siempre es así de efusiva? – dice aun riéndose. -Esa es su personalidad – le sonrío de regreso. -Por cierto, amo tu cabello – me dice Jenn – todos esos rizos perfectos enmarcando tu rostro, en verdad quisiera que ese estilo vaya conmigo, porque los amo, pero mi cabello es muy liso. -Gracias, aunque es muy difícil mantenerlos así. -¿a quién dedico el autógrafo? – me pregunta Jenn señalando mi libreta. -Para Alexandra, por favor – ella escribe. -Mucho gusto Alexandra – me responde mientras firma, de pronto la multitud grita. -Oh por Dios, es Josh –grita Alyson y mi corazón se para literalmente, mi mirada se dirige al inicio del recorrido y ahí está. Hermoso, sexy, tan bello como siempre, no puedo dejar de mirarlo. -Uy, en verdad ese hombre te cautivó – me dice Jenn mirándome, sacándome de mi ensoñación. Pero todo mi mundo se detiene cuando nuestras miradas se encuentran, solo existimos nosotros, nuestra conexión fluyendo, atrayéndonos y no reacciono hasta que él dice mi nombre en voz alta y empieza a venir hacia mí. Jenn me mira intrigada y puedo ver en su rostro el reconocimiento. -No lo puede creer, así que tú eres su Alex – cuando dice la palabra \"Su\", algo se remueve en mi interior, rápidamente le quito mi libreta y empiezo a atravesar la multitud antes de que Josh llegue a mí. -No. Espera Alex- Jenn me llama. -Gracias por todo – le digo alejándome, atravieso a multitud lo más rápido que puedo, escuchando los gritos de Josh y Jenn llamándome. Cuando logro salir del montón de personas las lágrimas fluyen por mis mejillas. -Alex espera por favor – la voz de Alyson me hace detenerme, me seco las lágrimas con la manga de mi suéter, cuando su mano se posa en mi hombro -¿Estás bien? -Si… bueno en realidad me duele la cabeza por eso salí de ahí, me voy para el departamento ¿si? -Perdóname amiga. -¿perdonarte? ¿Por qué?, mejor tu perdóname por arruinarte la noche – ella me da una sonrisa. -Debí reconocerte, soy fan de Josh desde hace mucho, no sé cómo no pude darme cuenta que eres su exnovia – una punzada atravesó mi corazón - , debo admitir que me siento traicionada por que no me lo hayas contado, te considero casi una hermana Alex, pero me siento más mal conmigo por obligarte a venir – soltó un suspiro – Cuando Josh dijo tu nombre y Jenn se refirió a ti como \"Su Alex\" todo vino a mí, te reconocí de inmediato y fue cuando me di cuenta por qué no querías venir -Aly, no te dije no porque no te tenga confianza, sino porque es un capítulo en mi vida que quedo cerrado y no quise revivirlo. -¿lo quieres aun? – Cuando no respondí ella continuo – porque él aun te quiere, debiste ver su rostro cuando te vio y mucho más la desesperación cuando te fuiste. -Eso no es posible, él nunca me quiso. No como yo a él. -Podría saber que paso con ustedes? – me miro con comprensión mientras caminamos por la calle – un día eran la pareja más famosa, los más cursis, los más felices y al siguiente día él te suplicaba una oportunidad, te dedicaba canciones, te pedía perdón por algo que solo ustedes saben, pero nunca volvieron a estar juntos… solo después sabía que cada uno tenía una nueva relación, aunque el terminó con Claudia casi en seguida, me imagino que tu pareja era Darío. Asentí – Te lo voy a contar pero tienes que prometer no decírselo a nadie y más que todo que no volveremos a tocar el tema. -Vale – le conté sobre mi noviazgo con Josh, como nos conocimos en Denver, como nos reencontramos en nuestro país, como encontré el mail donde confirmaban que él me había usado para subir su fama y me había traicionado con su exnovia – No lo puedo creer, ¡que imbécil! ¿ y que hizo cuando tú te enteraste? -La verdad es que me busco para que le diera una oportunidad, pero es obvio que no quería saber de él, el regreso acá y luego de unos meses me busco porque se enteró que estaba embarazada. -OMG! Estuviste embarazada de Josh.! ¿Qué paso con su bebé? -Fue una falsa alarma, pero lo que más me dolió fue que él quiso valerse de un bebé para obligarme a que lo perdoné – su rostro de sorpresa me ínsito a continuar – luego tuve que viajar a Denver porque una persona muy importante estaba enferma, recuerdas que te hable de Kristin. -Sí, la señora que te dejó herencia, la mamá de Peter. -Bueno, cuando me enteré que ella se estaba muriendo, yo estaba con Josh, él estuvo conmigo durante el velorio y los asuntos legales de mi herencia, luego el día que regresaba a mi país le pedí que no me siguiera, que entendiera que lo de nosotros terminó… -Así que no te busco – lo dijo como afirmación más que como pregunta. -No. Si lo hizo, de alguna manera logró enviar mensajes whatsapp, correo y otras redes sociales, continuo publicando canciones haciendo que todo mundo supiera que yo ya no lo quería – suspire – ¿puedes imaginar lo frustrada que me sentía?, además de que todo mundo lo compadecía a Josh, yo era la mala de la película, él tenía que hacerlo público lo que aumento mi ira, después de haberme usado para elevar su fama el debió aprender, pero no siguió siendo egoísta… ahí fue cuando acepte a Darío, justo al día siguiente que Josh anunció su romance con Claudia.- hice una mueca de dolor ante los recuerdos – Él me escribía pidiéndome perdón cada vez… tenía a Claudia y aun así me buscaba, ese no era el hombre de que me enamoré, hasta que un día se cansó y dejo que siguiéramos adelante. Me dijo su Adiós. -Bueno eso es algo triste, que algo tan bonito terminara así. -Sí, es un capítulo que no quiero recordar, quiero olvidarlo, pero es tan difícil, cada vez que veo una foto de él, una película, o tan solo algo que me lo recuerde siento como mi corazón y mi razón entran en disputa, sé que ya debería olvidarlo, pero el dolor sigue tan vivo como cuando me enteré que me engañó. -¿Aun lo amas? – me negué a responder, no creo que algo que te cause tanto dolor sea en verdad amor - ¿amas a Darío? - Lo amo – dije sin duda. Pero a veces pienso que más que amarlo lo necesito, él ha sido una razón para no sumirme en la tristeza – lo quiero, sí. Mucho. Pero él es la única persona para mí. Lo de Josh es cosa del pasado, algo superado. -Pero Josh sabe que estas cerca ¿Qué harás si te busca? -Dudo que lo haga, pero la ciudad es grande. -Pero… él aun te quiere, estoy segura, te buscará, deberías darle otra oportunidad. -No tengo porque dársela. ¿para qué? Soy feliz con lo que tengo, lo único que él trajo a mi vida fue dolor. Aun si lo siguiera amando, no lo perdone antes, estoy segura de no poder perdónalo ahora. -Pero… - la interrumpí. -Pero nada Alyson, ya te conté lo que querías saber, ahora olvidaras el tema como me lo prometiste. -Está bien, pero deberías pensarlo. - No hay nada que pensar. ** Helado de Oreo: no se como sí LLAME en sus Información countries Pero es mi helado Favorito Que normalmente es de coco o vainilla estafa galleta oreo en EL :) ¿De Qué les parecio?

Cuando sus manos y mis labios estaban por todas partes, cuando éramos solo ella y yo contra el mundo, donde solo nuestro amor y la pasión reinaban.[Chapter 67] Capítulo 67 El sol se filtra por las cortinas de mis ventanas, mis ojos rechazan la luz, no quiero despertar, no después de ese sueño, mejor dicho de los recuerdos que llenaron mi mente anoche. Sobre todo no quiero volver a la realidad donde no la tengo a ella, donde la perdí. Mi subconsciente siempre me juega mal, me trae recuerdos de nuestros momentos felices, y como en este caso me hizo soñar con la vez que la hice mía. Cuando sus manos y mis labios estaban por todas partes, cuando éramos solo ella y yo contra el mundo, donde solo nuestro amor y la pasión reinaban. Abro mis ojos cuando el sonido de la puerta de mi baño se abre. Cuando Claudia sale envuelta en una toalla luego de su ducha es cuando recuerdo la noche anterior y la vergüenza que siento por haberla usado provoca una punzada de culpa. -Que bien que te hayas despertado – dice ella mientras se coloca sus bragas, estudio su cuerpo desnudo, obviamente soy hombre pero he descubierto que un cuerpo bonito no es suficiente para hacerte sentir mejor, es sexo no hacer el amor. - Clau..mmm.. yoo..- no sabía cómo empezar a disculparme. -Venga Josh, no quiero oír tu frasecita de \"lo de anoche fue un error\", ya hemos pasado mucho por ello, y en verdad ya me cansé de escucharla cada vez que terminamos durmiendo juntos – otra punzada de dolor me ataca, ella ya no es mi novia, yo mismo acabe con nuestra relación pero muchas veces hemos terminado teniendo sexo, yo sé que ella me quiere pero yo solo lo uso como una forma de escape, la razón de que mi culpa aumente. -Realmente lo siento Clau, pero si fue un error que espero no volver a cometer – lo último lo dije como un susurro. -Sabes Josh, en verdad ya me estoy cansando, terminaste nuestra relación, pero cada vez terminamos en sexo, no es justo para mí, yo te quiero y tú simplemente sigues pensado en otra mujer cuando estás conmigo. -No es así Clau, yo… -¿no es así? Anoche cuando lo estábamos haciendo gritaste su nombre, Josh – me mira con exasperación – Yo sé que la quisiste pero debes seguir adelante, ya pasó más de 1 año Josh, ya déjala ir y sigue con tu vida. No sé qué decir, a veces pienso que nunca la dejaré de amar – En serio, debes seguir con tu vida Josh, ella es feliz sin ti y tu debes hacer lo mismo – se sienta a mi lado y toma mi mano – y si lo permites yo quiero ser esa persona que camine junto a ti. -Clau yo…- ella me besa, no respondo a su beso, pero me sorprende su actitud. -Piénsalo si – y se fue sin poder responderle, tengo que pensar, quizás es hora de que trate de rehacer mi vida, ella está lejos y no puedo hacer nada, pero solo quiero una señal para saber qué debo hacer. Dios..! Dame una señal de que debo hacer, por favor. Decido concentrarme en otra cosa, tengo que ir a la tintorería por el traje adecuado para la Premier de Sinsajo II, después de que termine todo esto pensaré en lo que hare con mi vida y la propuesta de Claudia. Luego de prepárame para la premier, me dirijo hacia ella. Apenas bajo de mi auto la multitud ruge mi nombre. Avanzo sonriendo por la alfombra, más adelante observo a Jenn firmando autógrafos, cuando mi mirada se cruza con la chica a quien Jenn da su autógrafo. Mi corazón literalmente se detuvo, mi respiración se volvió irregular. No podía ser ella, debía ser un sueño. Parpadeo y me doy cuenta que la escena es real. Ella está aquí, está muy cerca... si pedí a Dios una señal para saber que hacer creo que esta es. La dueña de mi corazón está a poca distancia. Su rostro es tan bello como siempre, su cabello que antes llegaba a su cintura ahora apenas llega a sus hombros haciendo que sus rizos alborotados enmarque su rostro, ahora son de color negro azabache, el castaño que la caracterizaba ya no está. Pero por mas cambio aún sé que es ella, tan solo ver su mirada, esos ojos color del ébano que siempre reflejan su alma, pero ahora me miran con un sentimiento que no puedo descifrar ¿odio? ¿duda?¿sorpresa? quizás ¿amor?, quisiera que fuera amor. De mis labios se escapa su nombre, lo que nos hace reaccionar. Ella toma la libreta de las manos de Jenn y empieza alejarse entre la multitud. Jenn y yo gritamos su nombre. No puedo dejar que se vaya, pero no puedo atravesar la multitud. Empiezo a regresar por la alfombra por donde llegue, tengo que encontrarla, hablarle aunque la verdad no sé qué decirle. Claro que lo sé, necesito decirle que aun la amo, que nunca dejaré de hacerlo. Pero una mano me sujeta del brazo. -No puedes irte Josh, esta premier es importante. -Necesito encontrarla, Jenn. -Dudo que lo hagas, si sales de la alfombra la multitud te atacarán, además ella ya debe estar lejos. -Pero necesito hacer algo – ella me mira comprensiva y me toma de la mano llevándome hacia donde estaba Alex, se acerca a dos chicos altos, musculoso, rubios. -Hola Chicos, soy Jenn aunque creo que eso ya lo saben – ellos se ríen de su comentario. - Soy Paul y él es mi hermano Luke – dice uno de ellos señalando a su hermano. -Mucho gusto chicos, pero necesito que me hagan un favor. -El que tú quieras – contesta Luke con tono coqueto. -Necesito encontrar a la chica que estaba con ustedes, la chica morena con los rizos alborotados. -¿Alex? – pregunta Paúl y al solo escuchar su nombre mi corazón salta como loco – Es la amiga de mi hermana, pero solo eso sé. -Necesito su número o dirección para poder contactarla, no es para nada malo. -Bueno...- dice Luke dudando – nosotros podríamos obtener esa información... -Se los debería por siempre – grita Jenn. -Solo si aceptas tomar un café con nosotros – Me da ganas de golpear a este imbécil por sus intentos de coqueteo, mis manos se vuelven puños. -Claro – dice Jenn – dame tu número y yo te llamaré para que podamos reunirnos - Ellos sonríen y le pasan un papel con un número escrito en él. -Esperamos a que nos llames. - Y yo espero que averiguen toda la información posible, a más tardar los llamo pasado mañana -Claro, esperaremos ansiosos – Jenn se despide de ellos y tira de mi hacia el centro de la alfombra, donde todos los fotógrafos nos miran intrigados. Mierda, olvide que ellos estaban aquí y mañana esto será una gran noticia. Espero que no hayan reconocido a Alex. -Ahora más te vale poner una sonrisa en esa cara, yo conseguiré la información que necesitas de esos dos. -Gracias Jenn, en verdad no tengo como agradecerte. -Me debes una Hutcherson, pero quiero que la busques y la recuperes, sé que aun la amas y creo que ella a ti. -De eso no estoy muy seguro. -Cállate Joshua. Las mujeres tenemos un sexto sentido y yo vi cómo te miro, si no le importaras ella no hubiera reaccionado así… Quizás ese sentimiento este escondido pero de que hay algo ahí, lo hay… Además tú nunca fuiste el mismo desde que terminaron y quiero de regreso a mi amigo. Yo solo la abrazo. Quiero mucho a esta chica. Pase el resto de la noche fingiendo que mi atención estaba en esta premier. Pero mi mente, mi alma y mi corazón vagaban entre los recuerdos y la imagen de ella esta noche. Pedí a Dios una señal de que hacer con mi vida. Ahora sé. Él me la trajo de nuevo a mi vida y no desperdiciaré esta oportunidad para recuperarla. Hooolaaa.. se que quieren matarme x actualizar ahora pero creanme que no pude hacerlo antes...! estoy atascada en un cap.. odio cuando sucede esto y en verdad me esta costando asi que quiero su opinion? - Prefieren 2 caps largos o varios caps cortos q actualizaría a mas tardar pasando un día. ... xfs ayudenme a decirdir quiero terminar con esta etapa dificil para poder seguir con lo interesante ;) Espero sus reviews.. xfs no dejen de dejarlos (suena redundante). quiero saber que piensan..! AVANCE: No podía amarlo todavía ¿verdad? Pensar en él solo me llenaba de malos sentimientos que no eran propios de mí. Pero con Darío… con él todo era feliz. Me sentía segura, amada, segura. Sabía a qué atenerme con él, sabía que nunca me decepcionaría de nuevo. Ya no es el mismo adolescente hormonal que jugó con mi inexperiencia, ahora es un hombre decidido, luchador que daría lo que fuera pro verme feliz. Es todo lo que necesito.[Chapter 68] Capítulo 68 - ¿Cómo quieres que reaccione, Alexandra? Me despierto hoy con la noticia de que MI novia fue a reencontrarse con su EXnovio. ¿Cómo piensas que me siento? – Darío gritó exasperado al otro lado de la línea. Entendía su disgusto. En verdad. El chisme se había regado rápidamente. Para el siguiente día una foto de Josh yendo hasta mi lugar detrás de la barra de seguridad y yo alejándome apareció en todos los noticieros de farándula. Los encabezados no ayudaron en absoluto. La noticia sobre el hecho de habíamos regresado o que yo fui a verlo arrepentida de haberlo dejado anteriormente. En algunas decían que yo había buscado esta ocasión para avisar a Josh sobre nuestro hijo que mantenía \"oculto\". Quería contarle a mi novio lo que había sucedido pero no pude contactarlo y cuando lo hice había obtenido toda su rabia y frustración. - Lo siento ¿vale? - ¿Lo sientes? Eso no soluciona nada. Si querías volver con él solo debiste decírmelo, Alex. – Suspiró y habló con voz más calmada - Yo solo quiero verte feliz aunque me duela tu decisión. En este momento siento que estoy perdiendo lo más valioso que tengo. Y me duele que no te hayas detenido a pensar en mí solo un instante. Hubiera querido que me digas lo que en verdad sentías. ¿sabes? Cuando dijiste que me amabas… pensé que por fin te había recuperado, que la vida me sonreía, que tendría todo lo que necesitaba. Me duele perderte. - Darío, por favor escucha…- lo interrumpí. Él se quedó en silencio. Tomé una larga respiración y medité las palabras que diría. No podía perderlo por una estupidez – Te amo. Lo digo en serio. Sí, cometí un error pero te juro que lo hice porque no pude encontrar una excusa para no ir. No pensé que nos encontraríamos… - Sabías que él estaba ahí. Era obvio que lo encontrarías – su tono exasperado me enfureció. Desde que empezamos a hablar solo he escuchado reclamos y cada vez que trataba de excusarme y hacerle entrar en razón él me debatía. Yo estaba disculpándome, abriéndole mi corazón y él solo estaba cegado por los celos y la rabia. - Déjame terminar, maldita sea. – Grité – SI. Sabía que ahí estaría Josh, sabía que lo vería pero eso no significa NADA. Cree lo que quieras, ya me estoy cansando de esto. Cometí un error. No pensé que él me vería pero lo que importa aquí es que te quiero a ti. Él es cosa del pasado y si me pierdes no será porque me volví a encontrar con Josh si no por tu maldita actitud y tu maldita desconfianza a mis sentimientos. Colgué. Estaba furiosa y herida. Cuando sus constantes llamadas me acecharon apagué mi celular y me hice un ovillo y en mi cama. Era verdad lo que le había dicho a Darío. Lo amaba. El ver a Josh no podía cambiar mis sentimientos. Él era parte de mi pasado, un pasado que odiaba y aunque no era distante todavía vivía en el dolor que Josh me causó. Y ese mismo pasado me estaba causando problemas ahora. No podía amarlo todavía ¿verdad? Pensar en él solo me llenaba de malos sentimientos que no eran propios de mí. Pero con Darío… con él todo era feliz. Me sentía segura, amada, segura. Sabía a qué atenerme con él, sabía que nunca me decepcionaría de nuevo. Ya no es el mismo adolescente hormonal que jugó con mi inexperiencia, ahora es un hombre decidido, luchador que daría lo que fuera pro verme feliz. Es todo lo que necesito. Con Josh desde un inicio todo fue inesperado. Había puesto muchos anhelos y esperanzas en algo que sabía que iba a terminar mal. Pero fui ilusa y me arriesgué a pesar de que era consciente de lo que sucedería. Pero ¿cómo le dices a tu corazón que está equivocado? ¿Cómo le explicas que la persona que lo hace despertar no es la adecuada? Verlo de nuevo me hizo… no sé lo que me hizo. Sé que aún existe esa atracción. Es algo que quizás nunca se rompa o tal vez el tiempo lo logré. Pero solo es eso. Solo debía ser eso. No iba a cambiar mi vida por la inestabilidad que Josh me ofrecía. Ni siquiera sabía porque me estaba cuestionando la idea de tener a Josh nuevamente en mi vida. Era estúpido. Ambos hemos avanzado, nuestras vidas son diferentes, ya no hay forma de que vuelvan a colisionar ¿verdad? Caí en un profundo sueño donde me rondaban hermosos ojos marrones rodeados de oscuras pestañas. Sentía la luz filtrarse bajo mis párpados pero no quería abrirlos. Sentí un aroma familiar envolverme y ligeros toques por todo mi rostro. Fue cuando unos labios cayeron sobre los míos cuando abrí mis ojos para encontrarme con el rostro de mi novio. Lo alejé de mí suavemente lo que provoco una mueca de dolor por su parte. Apoyé mi espalda en la cabecera de la cama y crucé mis brazos, debía recordar que estaba enfadada. Él sentó en el borde de la cama y pude ver que sostenía una única rosa roja en sus manos. Nos quedamos en un incómodo silencio hasta que él hablo. - Temí perderte. Tuve tanto miedo de que me dejarás por él. No desconfío de ningún otro pero no puedo ser indiferente a él. Fue la persona más importante en tu vida y aunque me duela aceptarlo es verdad. Cuando me enteré de que se reencontraron parte de mí se dio por vencida. No podía luchar contra él porque sería ir contra ti, contra tu felicidad y lo último que deseo en esta vida es quitarte las oportunidades de tener una vida plena – suspiro y continuó hablando sin apartar la vista dela rosa – Luego me dijiste lo que pasó y tenías mucha razón al decir que son mis inseguridades lo que te alejarían de mí. No él… soy estúpido y actué con el ser más deplorable por miedo. No es excusa pero no tengo otra. Y si todavía quieres estar conmigo te prometo no dejarme cegar otra vez de esta manera, porque ahora sé que me amas y yo te amo más que nada en esta vida y no cambiaría nada de lo que tenemos. Todo el enfado que sentía se esfumó con sus argumentos. Cada palabra era la más pura verdad y si me ponía en sus zapatos yo habría actuado de la misma manera. – Si no me perdonas dedicaré cada segundo de mi vida en convencerte de lo estúpido que soy y lo enamorado que estoy de ti. No tendría que esperar. No había nada que perdonar. Entendió mi mensaje cuando me estrechó más contra él en el apasionante beso que yo inicié. Cuando entró en mí lo hizo lo más lento posible. A diferencia de nuestros últimos encuentros, donde las hormonas nos controlaban, disfrutamos cada instante de lo que teníamos. En medio de besos dulces y muchos \"te amo\" llegamos al éxtasis. Lo que sucedió, para bien o para mal, nos unió aún más. Ya no habría medio e inseguridades por fantasmas del pasado. Hoooola...! es bonito actualizar tan pronto aunq admito q dudo como estan quedandolos caps... pero quiero avanzar toda est parte dela historia muy rapidamente. Tenía planeado hacer algo largo.. x eos les pedí varias canciones.. pero he decidido ahcerlo conforme vaya saliendo.. ya me queda solo 1 semana de vacaciones y quiero apreovechar lo mas q puedo avanzando en la historia.. sobre todo esta parte queme estoy quedando estancada :) Creo q actualizare el viernes :) Espero sus reviews aunq sean chiquititos quiero saber lo q opinan q sucederá :P - Nos leemos luego - z3 MILET AVANCE: - ¿Lo seguirás negando? – le pregunté irónico. - Vale. No es asunto tuyo el hecho de que ella viva o no aquí. El hecho de decirte no cambia las cosas. Ella no va a volver contigo. Entiéndelo de una vez, Josh.[Chapter 69] Capítulo 69 Cuando llegué al hotel que me hospedaba encontré que mi hermano ya estaba dormido. No sé por qué pero me sentía traicionado. Sé que él sabía que ella estaba tan cerca por eso insistió tanto en venir aunque sabía que no podíamos hacer anda juntos debido a la premier. Él nunca negó el hecho de que seguía en contacto con ella y yo no era tan egoísta como para exigirle lo contrario. Herido decidí dormirme. Ya en la cama pensé que tal vez era una coincidencia. Mi hermano no me traicionaría ¿verdad? Él sabe lo importante que es ella para mí. Tal vez ella no se lo dijo para evitar que me lo comente. Porque eso es lo que hacen los hermanos. Confían unos en otros. Él sabe que es mi vida. Decidí dejarlo pasar. Mi hermano es leal a mí. Solo sería un estúpido desconfiando de las personas que quiero. Me levanté con los pasos de Connor en el pequeño salón donde se encontraba un gran televisor. Cuando salí de mi habitación escuché la ducha del baño encenderse. Encendí el televisor e inmediatamente un programa de chismes mañaneros anunciaba una nota sobre… Alex y yo. Hablaban sobre nuestro reencuentro y mostraron un video de toda la escena. - Donde hubo fuego cenizas quedan – comentó una de las presentadoras – pensamos que anoche en la premier de Mockingjay II fue su reencuentro pero ahora tenemos nueva información que nos hace pensar que ellos han regresado y lo han tenido oculto del mundo. Bueno esa es una de las teorías. - Si te soy sincera creo que ambos parecen sorprendidos cuando se encontraron en el video. En especial Josh. Si estuvieran juntos no veo el motivo de su huida, que a mi parecer es lo que ella hace. Es ilógico- comentó otra presentadora. - A menos que ellos nos digan no lo sabremos, pero yo creo que pronto sabremos la verdad. Ahora luego de comerciales tendrán el video en que se basa la nueva teoría. Miren a continuación. Y en ese momento aparece una foto de Connor y Alex hablando en n heladería. La imagen se mantiene por unos segundos e inmediatamente aparecen los comerciales. Traición. Es la palabra que ronda mi mente. En ese momento sale mi hermano frotándose la cabeza con una toalla. Toda la ira contenida en mí se desata y cuando me doy cuenta estoy empujando a mi hermano contra una pared. - ¿POR QUÉ DIABLOS NO ME DIJISTE QUE ELLA ESTA AQUÍ? - ¿De quién hablas? – me pregunta nervioso. Nunca es bueno mintiendo. - No me vengas con tonterías. Se supone que eres mi hermano. Sabes lo importante que es ella para mí y no tuviste la decencia de decirme que ella está tan cerca. – con mi puño golpeo la pared a unos centímetros de su cara y camino hacia la sala aun frustrado – Anoche la vi. Estaba… hermosa. No esperé volver a verla y estaba ahí mirándome. Por un instante olvidé todo lo mal que me ha sucedido desde que ella me dejó y al siguiente instante ella huía de mí. Fue cuando comprendí que nunca podría dejarla ir. Luego me di cuenta que tú sabias todo y no me lo dijiste. - No lo sabía. – mintió. Lo supe cuando desvío la mirada - Puede que ella solo esté de paso. Que estuviera aquí no quiere decir que viva aquí. Justo en ese momento apareció el video de Connor y Alex juntos. Charlando. Riendo. Maldita envidia, ese debería ser yo. Connor hizo una mueca. Las entrevistadoras hablaron sobre el hecho de los lazos familiares que daban lugar a esta nueva teoría. - ¿Lo seguirás negando? – le pregunté irónico. - Vale. No es asunto tuyo el hecho de que ella viva o no aquí. El hecho de decirte no cambia las cosas. Ella no va a volver contigo. Entiéndelo de una vez, Josh. Dio un buen golpe a su puerta y se encerró todo el día en ella hasta la hora que tenía que ir al aeropuerto para viajar a casa. No dijimos ni una sola palabra acerca del tema. Apenas nos dijimos un \"nos vemos\" antes de que ingrese a la sala de espera. Cuatro días después estaba intranquilo, no podía sentarme. Lo único que calmaba mi ansiedad era caminar como loco por todo mi apartamento. Cuando sonó el timbre estaba al borde de la locura. Me apresuré a abrir dando paso a Jenn que se apresuró a desplomarse en mi sillón. - ¿Qué averiguaste? – mi tono definitivamente era lastimero. - Que la bendita chica es malditamente rica, inteligente y una santa- eso ya lo sabía. Necesitaba saber su dirección y cosas sobre su vida – Todo lo que me dijeron lo consiguieron de su hermana. Al parecer viven en el mismo complejo de apartamentos y son compañeras en el posgrado de oncología infantil. - ¿Tienes la dirección? – Por supuesto –me paso un papel – Vive en ese edificio aunque no sabían exactamente en qué piso. Estudia en Harvard. Es una chica inteligente y con dinero para estar allí. Sus prácticas las realiza en Hospital General de Massachusetts y en el Hospital de Niños Boston. También me dijeron que según les había contado su hermana estudiaba un curso a distancia de administración de empresas lo que le sirve para hacer su manejo en sus negocios. Dedica su dinero en mejorar el departamento de recursos humanos y está creando proyectos de beneficencia para construir hospitales y casa de acogida para familiares de enfermos. En serio, esa chica tiene un buen corazón. ¿Cómo pudiste dejarla ir? Sabía del gran corazón y la gran persona que era. Mi mueca de dolor hizo que Jenn me diera una sonrisa de disculpa. Si hubiera sido por mí nunca se hubiera ido de mi lado – Como si fuera pocos cada 2 sábados trabaja voluntariamente en un refugio de animales para la calle. Esa chica no tiene tiempo libre desde mi punto de vista. ¿Le debe algo al mundo o simplemente es una santa? ¿qué haces? - Voy a buscarla – le respondí terminando de colocarme mi chaqueta. - Estás loco. No puedes hacer eso. - Claro que puedo y lo voy a hacer – dije buscando mis llaves. Jenn me sujeto del brazo. - Ellos me dijeron que ella vive con su novio – me tomó un momento entender. Me dejé caer sobre el sofá – Ella vive con su novio y sus dos mejores amigos ¿Vez por qué no puedes ir? - Maldita sea – gimo. ¿Porque todo tiene que ser tan malditamente complicado? ¿Por qué simplemente no puedo tener lo que más quiero? - No creo que presentarte en tu puerta y decirle: \"Hola Alex, sé que no hemos hablado en más de un año pero te amo y estoy aquí para que dejes a tu novio por mí\". - No te da el sarcasmo, Jennifer. - Y tú no puedes ser tan tonto. - Vale – levanté mi brazos con furia – Tú eres la que me dijo que ella me sigue queriendo. ¿qué se supone que haga? - Si, se lo que dije pero no puedes simplemente aparecerte. Tienes que estar seguro de lo que sientes y si realmente quieres interferir en su vida. - Claro que se lo que siento. Nunca, en todo este tiempo deje de amarla ¿por qué nadie puede entender que no es algo pasajero? Lo que siento por ella jamás cambiará y sí que quiero interferir en su vida. No debí permitir que ella me deje, ni haberme alejado. Lo que nos pasó fue injusto, ambos nos pertenecemos. Y si yo no pude olvidarla estoy seguro que lo mismo le pasa a ella. - Puedes tener razón. Sé que vi algo de amor en ella en medio de toda la conmoción pero… -¿Pero? – la verdad es que no quería saber los peros. - Pero quizás ella sea feliz y no te necesite. Sé que no es lo que quieres oír pero tal vez si deberías renunciar a la idea de tu y yo juntos. Ella te amó, y quizás aún tiene algo de ese sentimiento porque como tú dices lo de ustedes fue algo… grande. Pero ella tiene una vida, un novio, una carrera, no puedes simplemente aparecer y complicarle la existencia. Si te acercas a ella y la confundes o aún peor te rechazas solo habrás empeorado las cosas para ambos. Debes pensar muy bien lo que harás. Sabía que tenía razón pero no podía dejarla ir otra vez. Cada día me arrepiento de haber enviado esa carta y no buscarla. Pero mi amor por ella es puro y mi felicidad es la de ella. Necesito pensar, así que salí de mi departamento dejando a Jennifer ahí. Caminé por horas. No supe a donde iba o tal vez sí. Mis pasos me llevaron a ella. Leí su dirección y comprobé que de algún modo llegué a su casa. Me senté en un pequeño banco en el parque frente al edificio donde ella debía vivir. Sonreí al notar su debilidad por los parques. Recuerdo su fascinación por la naturaleza. Ella soñaba con una casa rodeada de gran espacio verde donde pudiera respirar aire puro. Le había dicho que cuando viviéramos juntos compraríamos una casa en medio de un bosque y junto a un arroyo donde solo seríamos ella y yo disfrutando de nuestra compañía. Donde nuestros hijos crecieran rodeados de lo hermoso que hay en esta vida y aprenderían a apreciar los pequeños detalles que en verdad son importantes para ser feliz. Todo quedó solo en palabras. Recuerdo cuando tomaba el camino más largo de su casa a la universidad solo para caminar en medio de las flores y árboles junto al río. Recuerdo haberla besado muchas veces rodeados solo de un cielo estrellado. Sonrío ante los recuerdos. Miro hacia la entrada de su edificio y me estremezco cuando la veo. Estoy a una distancia segura para que no me vea pero yo sí puedo reconocerla. Ella está con un niño que no debe tener más de 12 años. Tomados de la mano cruzan la calle hacia donde estoy. Me muevo rápido unos metros y busco un lugar seguro. Ellos compran un helado y empiezan a caminar por los senderos del parque. Los sigo. Ahora que la tengo cerca no puedo alejarme. Mientras ellos continúan su marcha empiezo a notar detalles que me di cuenta hace un par de noches. Su cabello ahora es corto. Apenas rozan sus hombros y ahora son de color negro. No sé por qué cambio su estilo pero definitivamente hace que luzcan más seria, más adulta y madura pero sigue siendo increíblemente bella. Sus rizos enmarcados hacen su rostro más delicado y su pequeña nariz respingona más fina aún. Recuerdo estar obsesionado con sus pequeñas pecas y manchas de sol en su nariz y sus mejillas. Con ese color de cabello su piel se ve más clara y apuesto que sus pecas resaltan. Muero por poder besarlas. Lo que me preocupa es su figura. No me malinterpreten. Con ese top y ese short jean se ve extremadamente sexy. Sus piernas siguen luciendo hermosas y atrayentes; su cuello y sus hombros siguen siendo completamente besables. Sus curvas siguen siendo sensuales y… me están excitando este preciso momento. Trato de respiran antes de que mi amigo se despierte aún más y termine sin poder caminar. Como decía, a pesar de que sigue siendo la mujer más bella y más sexy, luce delgada. Apostaría a que ha perdido más de 5 kilos desde la última vez que la vi. Me preocupa. Sé qué ella no haría una dieta para mejorar su figura. No es de esas chicas superficiales obsesionadas con su cuerpo. Por esa razón me preocupa. Tal vez este enferma o el estrés de su vida ha provocado esto, pero quisiera asegurarme de que esté bien. Los seguí por todo el parque y su camino de regreso. Ellos ríeron, jugaron y conversaron durante todo el trayecto. Estaba estúpidamente celoso de un niño. Quería ser ese niño. Quería hacerle reír como lo hace él. Cuando entraron en el edificio y desapareció de mi vista volví a sentirme desolado. Solo. Pero estaba más decidido que nunca. La recuperaría. Y si ella ya no me amaba volvería a reconquistarla. Ahora tenía un plan. Hooolaaa :) Muy bien mátenme..! se que prometí actualizar el viernes pero creanme que no he podido escribir y hoy salgo de viaje.. regreso el miércoles justo para actualizar :) Estoy concentrandome lo mas que puedo para avanzar en la historia :) ¿que les pareció? mucho drama...! la verdad es q no soy amiga del drama y los giros del destino pero son necesarios y trato de hacerlo sutil :P Por favor.. sigan dejando sus reviews sobre q les parece y que creen q sucederá. eso es importante xq necesito saber si estoy dejando las pistas suficientes :P No me matén.. trataré de actualizar... es dificil escribir cuando uno se estanca en ciertos cap x eso decidí avanzar rápido..! Nos leemos luego :) -z3 MILET AVANCE: El pánico me atraviesa cuando llego a ella. La tomo por los hombros y la sacudo pero no responde. Recojo sus cosas, las pongo en mi bolsillo y levanto su cuerpo en mis brazos. Gracias al cielo estuve aquí y puedo ayudarla. No quiero ni imaginarme que hubiera sucedido si estaba sola. El camino es largo de regreso a la parte poblada del parque. Cuando llego ahí rápidamente hago parar un taxi quien nos lleva al hospital más cercano.[Chapter 70] Capítulo 70 Tenía prevista mi estrategia. Después de planearlo por muchos días, lo hacía cuando no estaba acechándola. Muy acosador lo sé pero era inevitable. Sabía cada movimiento de cada día de su semana. Era una rutina que muy pronto alteraría. Noté que pasa mucho tiempo sola. Su novio viaja mucho y sus amigos, Santiago y Fernanda, Trabajan duro. Ahora mi plan. En realidad tengo 2 pero dado lo desesperado que estoy hoy la abordaré en su trote matutino de los sábados. Es el único día que puedo porque su troté de miércoles lo hace con su novio y el del viernes con Alyson o con ese pequeño que parece que la sigue como un pollito a una gallina. Lo sé. Sigo celoso del chico. Patético. Ella empezó a correr por los senderos. Sabía que se adentraría a la zona que llega al pequeño arroyo. Son como 3 kilómetros, muy pocas personas van por ahí. Luce una camiseta de tiras ceñida a su cuerpo y una licra que llega a sus rodillas. Como siempre. Odia el calor por eso busca la menor cantidad ropa. Sonrío al darme cuenta que no ha cambiado. La sigo a una distancia segura. Ella se concentra en su trote que no es muy rápido. La escucho tararear canciones que escucha a través de sus audífonos. Cuando llega al arroyo se sienta en una piedra junto a este y empieza a respirar. Dejando de lado sus audífonos se acomoda en el suelo para realizar estiramientos. Luego de un momento la veo ponerse de pie y sujetarse de uno de los árboles. Creo que ha llegado mi momento. Empiezo a avanzar hacia ella. Cuando solo falta unos pasos me doy cuenta de que algo no está bien. Escuchó su respiración superficial y la veo aferrarse al tronco del árbol y es cuando grito su nombre que la veo desplomarse contra el suelo. El pánico me atraviesa cuando llego a ella. La tomo por los hombros y la sacudo pero no responde. Recojo sus cosas, las pongo en mi bolsillo y levanto su cuerpo en mis brazos. Gracias al cielo estuve aquí y puedo ayudarla. No quiero ni imaginarme que hubiera sucedido si estaba sola. El camino es largo de regreso a la parte poblada del parque. Cuando llego ahí rápidamente hago parar un taxi quien nos lleva al hospital más cercano. En el camino llamo a una amiga de mi mamá que trabaja ahí para que tenga todo preparado. Lo que me preocupa es que aún no recupera la conciencia. No le puede pasar nada malo. No a ella. Cuando llegamos a Emergencia del hospital me ayudaron a colocarla en una camilla y empezaron a ingresarla. - Josh – me llamó una voz conocida. Tuve que parar para hablar con ella mientras tanto las enfermeras se llevaban a Alex. Sentí inmediatamente un dolor físico por dejarla. - Tía Jules – ella me abrazó. - ¿Qué fue lo que sucedió? ¿Quién es ella? Podrías explicarme – me dijo en un tono mandón maternal. - Ella es mi exnovia. Estaba haciendo ejercicio y se desmayó. Tienes que curarla. Lo que sea que tiene – ella me invadió de preguntas sobre cómo pasó, hace que tiempo ocurrió, si se golpeó su cabeza cuando cayó. Trate de responder de la mejor manera posible pero estaba desesperado por verla y comprobar que está bien. – Tía, necesito que ella no se entere quien la trajo aquí. - ¿Por qué? - Bueno… es que… no quiero que se enteré de que estaba siguiéndola. - ¿Qué mierda, Josh? Eso lo sabrá, Michelle. Ante la mención de mi madre no pude evitar temblar – Tía Jules, yo amo a esa chica. Hoy iba a tratar de recuperarle y cuando me acerqué se desmayó. No quiero que piense mal de mí. Solo quiero una página en blanco para tratar de nuevo. Me miró con entendimiento y agradecí de salvarme de un regaño por parte de mi madre. En ese momento entró la enfermera para avisarnos de que Alex estaba despierta. Me sentí feliz por saber que estaba bien. – Muy bien voy para allá para hablar con ella. Necesito que le hagan un hemograma y una prueba de embarazo. Embarazo. La palabra resonó en mi mente por un largo rato. No podía pasar eso. Ella no podía estar embarazada de Darío. No podía asimilar la idea de ella teniendo una familia con alguien más que no sea yo. - ¿Puede… puede ella estar embarazada? – pregunté a mi tía luego de que la enfermera salió. - No lo sé, Josh. Pero debemos descartar esa posibilidad como causa de su síncope. ¿Por qué? ¿hay la posibilidad de que esté embarazada? – Empezó a faltarme el aire - ¿es tuyo? Negué con la cabeza. Estaba a punto de sufrir un ataque de pánico. El mundo no podía ser tan cruel conmigo. Mi tía me dio un vaso con agua y trato de tranquilizarme. Creo que mi mente se nubló y no podía pensar. Ella salió para ir a revisar a Alex y yo me quedé a la espera de resultados. Sabía que esa información cambiaría el rumbo de mi vida. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O Dejé a Darío en la ducha luego de una sesión mañanera de buen sexo. Aunque creo que ya hice el ejercicio necesario me vestí para salir a correr un poco como todos los sábados. Aunque era temprano el sol era fuerte en realidad. Odiaba tanto calor. Tarareaba una de mis canciones favoritas. Amaba el rock latino y este grupo en especial. Recuerdo escuchar desde que era una pequeña de 4 años. (Lamento Boliviano – Enanitos Verdes: www_youtube_com/watch?v=khbDnLqe_Wk&feature;=kp ) . Cuando llegué al pequeño riachuelo empecé a sentirme un poco mareada. Debía ser el calor. Trate de hacer ejercicios de relajación y respiración, pero empecé a tener dificultar con respirar. Me puse de pie y me aferré a un tronco para tratar de que mis pulmones puedan obtener todo el aire posible. Pero no funcionaba y empezaba a nublarse. Antes de que todo se volviera negro escuché una voz llamarme. Esa voz sonaba y hacía estremecer mis recuerdos y mi corazón. La sentía familiar. Demasiado familiar. Siento mis párpados pesados y trato de abrirlos. La luz me ciega durante un momento pero cuando la recupero identifico el lugar casi enseguida. Un hospital. No recuerdo lo que sucedió. Me desmayé es lo único de lo que estoy segura, pero no tengo idea como llegué a este lugar. Una enfermera entra y me saluda. Trato de preguntarle qué sucedió y como llegue a este lugar pero solo me dice que el médico que me está atendiendo me hablara sobre ello. Me toman muestras de sangre, seguramente para tratar de detectar que me pasó. Luego llega mi doctora. Es una señora de unos cuarenta años. Su rostro es amable. - ¿Cómo te sientes Alex? – me sorprende que sepa mi nombre. - Bien... creo. ¿Cómo sabe mi nombre? ¿Cómo llegué aquí? – necesito respuestas. - Un joven te encontró desmayada en un sendero y te trajo a este lugar. Él chico me dijo tu nombre, creo que lo encontró en tu celular o algo, realmente no lo sé ¿Recuerdas que te sucedió? - Solo recuerdo que me asfixiaba – mi cabeza está dando giros. - Será mejor que te recuestes mientras llegan los resultados. Descansa, sería buena que duermas un poco. No es lo mismo dormir que desmayarse. Luego podrás llamar a alguien para que venga por ti. Antes de que se fuera llamé – Podría agradecerle a la persona que me encontró de mi parte. Podría hacerle venir para agradecerle personalmente. Quería hacerlo. No quiero imaginar lo que me habría sucedido de no ser encontrada. Tengo la mala costumbre de alejarme mucho y el sendero que suelo usar es muy solitario. - Claro. Él está muy preocupado por ti. No sé porque eso sonó como algo personal. Trato de no pensar en ello y cierro mis ojos para sumergirme en los brazos de Morfeo. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O No sabía que pensar. No quería que estuviera embarazada. De ser así tendría que renunciar a ella y sé que no estoy dispuesto a ello. Tendría que dejarla ir antes de siquiera volver a tenerla. - Bien. No está embarazada puedes respirar – dijo mi tía entrando en el consultorio. El alivio me inundó inmediatamente y creo que sonreí. - Creo que no te sientes preparado para ser padre. - No es eso – confesé – quiero recuperarla, tía. Quiero volver con ella y si hubiera estado embarazada hubiera perdido mi oportunidad. - Esté o no embarazada no deberías perseguirla. Eso es raro, Josh. Terminarás asustándola. No me importaba lo que dijeran. La reconquistaría. El plan A no funcionó, por suerte tenía un plan B. - Ella quiere ver a su salvador para agradecerle. ¿Qué se supone que haga? - Dame 15 minutos y te diré que hacer – me levante y corrí hacia la puerta – ahora regresó. Salí a la calle y avancé al centro comercial más próximo. Busque un servicio de telefonía móvil y contraté otra línea. Esta sería especialmente para ella. Entraría en su vida de una forma que no espera. Ni siquiera sabrá cuando ni como llegué. Volvería a ser mía. O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - O - Bien, ya tengo tus resultados – dijo la Doctora Julianne entrando por la puerta – al parecer tienes un severo caso de anemia. Te recetaré hierro, ácido fólico y vitamina B12. Espero que tu dieta sea balanceada, a sus debidas horas, descanso y ejercicio moderado y por favor, nada de estrés. Suspiré aliviada. Solo era anemia. Estaría bien. - En cuanto a tu salvador… él tuvo que irse pero me pidió que te diera esto. Me tendió una hoja de papel doblada por la mitad. La doblé y la guardé en mi bolsillo. También me devolvió mi celular y luego de entregarme la receta partí a mi departamento. Ella sugirió que llamará par que vinieran por mí pero no quise preocupar a nadie por una simple enfermedad. Mientras volvía en el taxi, tomé el papel que me entregó la doctora y leí la nota destinada para mí. \"Sé que no te lo esperabas pero me alegra que estés bien. Me diste un gran susto. Sé que no me conoces pero yo me muero por conocerte. He querido llegar a ti y presentarme en varias ocasiones pero el destino no ha querido que sucediera. Ahora tengo mi oportunidad pero no quiero interferir en tu vida. Solo quiero contarte mi historia, de la forma en que mi vida ha trascurrido y ahora llegaron a ti. Espero que no me consideres un acosador y espero saber de ti. – R\" Adjuntó un número móvil. Seguramente esperaba que intente comunicarme con él. No sé por qué pero la idea me pareció fascinante. Me quedé pensando en su nombre. ¿R? Había un millar de nombres con esa letra. Será difícil averiguar quién es. Pero no puedo evitar la emoción de tener a alguien quien me escuché y no espera nada de mí. Dijo que no quería interferir en mi vida. Eso para mí es perfecto. Aunque… tampoco podía arriesgarme a confiar mis cosas a un extraño ¿y si era un acosador? Él dijo que no lo era. Pero es obvio que no lo admitiría. Pasé días con la duda de que hacer y la curiosidad por saber quién es y qué sucedería. Muchas veces estuve a punto de presionar enviar un mensaje a este número, y al mismo tiempo había algo que me detenía. Aunque… le debía las gracias por haberme ayudado. Y antes de que me diera cuenta ya había enviado el texto a su número. Hoooola :) no me maten.. no es mi culpa no haber atualizado ayer.. con el problema de google chrome, tambien tuvo problemas... ye recién me dejo publicar :) Q les parece? reencuentro... les haré sufrir un pokito antes de q se reencuentren.. pero cmo vieron muchas teorías son acertadas...! les diré que me quedan pocos días de vacaciones así que estoy apreovechando xq estos caps me estan costando mucho en escribirlos, pero bueno trataré de no demorar :P Como siempre agradezco sus reviews y mensajes... no saben lo feliz q me hace leerlos.. xfa sigan dejándolos :) -z3 Nos leemos luego :) MILET AVANCE: \"No es un cumplido… ante mis ojos eres la más hermosa niña. Sé que no tengo oportunidad contigo, de todos modos. Es por eso que no me presenté. No me preguntes de donde te conozco o cualquier otra cosas para saber quién soy, porque no quiero tener que mentirte. He esperado por mucho tiempo la manera de tenerte de alguna manera en mi vida.\"[Chapter 71] Capítulo 71 \"Hola. Solo quería agradecerte lo que hiciste por mí. Me hubiera gustado conocerte y agradecerte personalmente :) \" Creo que mi corazón salto de emoción y ahora tenía un grave problema tratando de que no se salga de mi pecho. Pensé que nunca me escribiría, que mi plan no funcionaría pero aquí esta. Le intrigué y ahora tengo la oportunidad de entrar de nuevo en su vida sin temer su rechazo. Debo ser su amigo, su aliado. Tiene que llegar a necesitarme y porque no, enamorarse de mí. A muchos les has pasado ¿Por qué no a mí? No me interesa como van las cosas. Solo quiero tenerla de algún modo. \"Me conoces. No tienes nada de que agradecerme. Puedo contarte un secreto?\" Me emocioné como adolescente con su primera novia a quién tratas de conquistarla con textos y cuando la tienes en frente no sabes que decirle. \"Claro, puedes decirme lo que quieras ;) \" \"Ese día tuve el valor para hablar contigo. He tratado mucho tiempo de hacerlo pero no sabía la manera. Y cuando caminé hacia ti te vi caer. No quiero que pienses que soy un acosador… lo único que quería era tener la oportunidad de tener a la niña más hermosa en mi vida, de alguna manera\" Espero que esto no le asusté. Supe que cometí un error en cuanto se lo envié. No pude ocultar mi interés por ella. Mi nerviosismo aumento cuando no respondió y estuve a punto de gritar por la estupidez que cometí, cuando sonó mi celular. \"Gracias por el cumplido… supongo que es una suerte de que estuvieras ahí ¿Xq no te presentaste en el hospital? ¿De dónde te conozco?\" Aunque estaba aliviado porque aún no perdí la oportunidad que había conseguido, sabía que no podía ser sincero con ella. \"No es un cumplido… ante mis ojos eres la más hermosa niña. Sé que no tengo oportunidad contigo, de todos modos. Es por eso que no me presenté. No me preguntes de donde te conozco o cualquier otra cosas para saber quién soy, porque no quiero tener que mentirte. He esperado por mucho tiempo la manera de tenerte de alguna manera en mi vida.\" \"No sé qué decirte. Me siento halagada y al mismo tiempo intrigada. Pero ya veo que no podré convencerte para que me digas quien eres. Me alegra que no quieras mentirme, pero yo no te puedo dar nada a cambio. Solo mi amistad…\" \"Eso es lo que quiero. Ser tu amigo. Que puedas confiar en mí (aunque dadas las circunstancias será difícil). No tienes que darme nada a cambio. Quiero esa amistad, quiero escucharte cuando me quieras contar algo y quiero poder compartirte lo que siento.\" Por ti…quería escribir esas palabras. Quería decir que la amaba pero no podía. No arruinaría esto. Y así empezó nuestra \"amistad\". La escribía a diario y ella me respondía con el mismo entusiasmo. Al inicio no sabíamos que tema abordar pero de a poco fuimos adquiriendo confianza. Me di cuenta de pequeños detalles que antes no estaban y ahora sí. La chica que conocí era completamente abierta a decir lo que pensaba y gritar sus sentimientos, mientras que esta chica era más reservada y cuidosa, en cierto modo podría decir que tenía miedo de que la defrauden. Parte de mí se siente culpable por haber logrado cambiar esas cosas en ellas. Nunca imaginé que después de lo que le hice ella seguiría siendo la misma. Yo no soy el mismo. Ya no trataba de saber quién soy. Ahora era su confidente y su amigo. Y por ahora eso me bastaba. \"¿cómo amaneció la más hermosa princesa?\" Sé que era cursi, no podía evitarlo. Al inicio no le gustaban mis halagos, decía que eran comprometedores porque ella tenía novio y permitir que alguien la tratara de esa manera era incorrecto. Pero le aseguré que no interferiría en su relación pero que no quería mentirle y si ocultaba lo que siento por ella estuviera mintiendo. No le había dicho expresamente que estaba enamorado de ella. Alex suponía que yo era un extraño que se enamoró platónicamente de ella y ahora era su amigo. Mientras le siguiera prometiendo que no interferiría en su vida todo estaría bien. \"Zzzz Zzzz Estoy muerta y no puedo dormir :P PD: Buenos días\" \"¿Alguna razón xq no puedas dormir? Tienes que descansar princesa. No quiero que vuelvas a enfermar\" Me aterra pensar en que pueda desmayarse nuevamente. Ayer mientras le observaba en su trote matutino pude ver que le faltaba el aire. Estuve a punto de correr hacia ella, levantarla en mis brazos y llevarla un médico. Por suerte nada sucedió y ella regresó bien a su departamento. Parte de mí quería volver a ser su héroe. Quería volver a estrecharla entre mis brazos. No había notado el hecho de que le había sostenido entre mis brazos por primera vez en mucho tiempo. Había sentido su piel, acariciado su cabello y respirado su aroma para volver a perderlo de la misma manera. \"Odio dormir sola. Antes tenía calor durante las noches, ahora muero de frío y cuando Darío no está no concilio mi sueño Zzzz Zzzz ;) \" Auch. Ella y su novio durmiendo no era exactamente la mejor imagen en mi mente. \"Tendremos que solucionar eso. Si yo fuera tu novio no te dejará sola ni un instante. No podría arriesgarme a perder mi más grande tesoro. Será mejor que tomes un té y a la cama señorita. Usted necesita dormir luego del turno. Sueñe con los angelitos\" No quería dejar de hablar con ella. Pero quería que se metiera en la cama y descansara. \"Soñaré contigo, angelito ;) \" Amaba esa parte coqueta de ella. Sabía que no lo decía en serio, era parte de su personalidad pero no evitaba emocionarme con la posibilidad de su interés en mí. \"Más vale que yo esté en tu mente, princesa\" \"Xq?\" \"Xq tú siempre estás en mis pensamientos. Es lo justo. Eres todo lo que puedo pensar y es lo mínimo que podrías hacer luego de convertirme en un perrito desolado buscando cariño, niña hermosa\" \"Si quisieras buscar novia, la conquistarías con esas frases :P Eres mi pequeño secreto! Hablamos luego Zzzzz Zzzzz\" Me gusta ser su pequeño secreto. Algo que aprecie tanto que solo lo quiera conservar para ella. Y sabía que iba por buen camino, sabía que ahora era parte muy importante de su vida y pronto llegaría a ser indispensable. Hoooola...! se q es tarde pero no se q sucede con la pagina que no quiere adjuntar los nevos caps :) pero creo q ya le cogí la maña..! Mañana regresó a clases... deseenme suerte..y sobretodo q tenga tiempo para seguir escribiendo frecuentemente :P ¿que les pareció? había planeado varios caps de este tipo pero decidí acortarlo para q no se aburran..! en verdad espero sus reviews aunq sea pequeñitos :P Tengo q ir a domir así q nos vemos el miercoles :) -Z3 MILET AVANCE: No quiero pensar en lo que esto significa. Sé muy bien que soy un amor platónico para este chico pero me duele porque lo he llegado a apreciar mucho, lo considero un amigo y no me gusta que mis amigos sufran. Me siento mal de pensar que en verdad está enamorado y yo le estoy dando alas de algún modo y al mismo tiempo hablándole sobre mi grandiosa relación.[Chapter 72] Capítulo 72 - OH Por Dios! OMG! OMG! – esa vocecita chillona no me dejaba dormir. Traté de bloquearla con la almohada sobre mi cabeza pero seguía sonando – Tú novio es maravilloso. Tengo que hacer que Santiago me compre algo tan bello como eso. - ¿De qué mierda estás hablando? – me había despertado y estaba de muy mal humor. - Primero. Feliz Día de la Amistad. – se abalanzó sobre mí en un abrazo de oso que yo correspondí. No recordaba la fecha. No sería un día feliz para mí sin Darío a mi lado. – Ahora tienes que venir a ver lo que mi adorado cuñado te ha enviado por este día. Me emocioné al pensar que Darío si recordó este día. Ambos hemos estado tan hundidos en nuestros mundos que pensé que se pasaría como a mí. Me levanto contagiada del entusiasmo de Fernanda. Vamos hacia nuestra sala y me encuentro con el más hermoso ramo de flores. Es un jarrón de cristal grande lleno de lirios stargazer con orquídeas de diversos colores. También tiene aliento de bebé de varios colores y una que otra Fresia. Es el ramo más hermoso que he visto y además es tan enorme que ocupa toda nuestra mesa de centro. Me acercó al ramo y observo su belleza. Su aroma me envuelve. – Lo tuvieron que traer entre dos personas. Darío te conoce perfectamente… A un lado tiene una pequeña tarjeta. La tomo y la saco de su pequeño sobre mientras Fernanda sigue parloteando de lo romántico que es mi novio en comparación del suyo. \"Si me pidieras las estrellas buscaría la manera de conseguírtelas… Espero que te hayan gustado, hermosa. Tenía que buscar algo que se comparara con tu belleza pero en el mundo no hay tanta perfección. Sé que no tengo derecho a esto pero... Sé mi Valentín. – R\" Al otro lado de la tarjeta había otra nota con un link. Me acerqué al portátil de Fer que estba encendido y tecleé el enlace. La canción empezó a sonar y leí el mensaje. (Stop and Stare –One Republic: www_youtube_com/watch?v=GmxqECd5wYA ) \" CREO QUE ME ESTOY MOVIENDO PERO NO VOY A NINGÚN LADO…Te has convertido en mi brújula, pequeña. PERO ME HE CONVERTIDO EN LO QUE NO PUEDO SER…He cambiado por ti. No quiero invadir tu vida, no quiero dañar tu equilibrio. He tratado tanto evitar no sentir esto, pero es inevitable no haberme enamorado y no desear poder tener una oportunidad…\" No quiero pensar en lo que esto significa. Sé muy bien que soy un amor platónico para este chico pero me duele porque lo he llegado a apreciar mucho, lo considero un amigo y no me gusta que mis amigos sufran. Me siento mal de pensar que en verdad está enamorado y yo le estoy dando alas de algún modo y al mismo tiempo hablándole sobre mi grandiosa relación. - Debes tener un muy buen regalo para tu novio – aseguró mi amiga – No sabía que le gustará este tipo de música. - No son de Darío – aclaro mientras busco mi móvil. Recuerdo haberlo escuchado sonar en medio de mis sueños. - ¿De quién son? – ella tenía la tarjeta y la leía. Me sentí incómoda mientras lo hacía. Mi privacidad se sentía invadida. – Oh. Este chico esta re-loco de amor. ¿Quién es? No quería admitirlo, pero sabía que ella me sacaría la verdad. Le conté todo, desde mi desmayo hasta nuestras constantes conversaciones. - ¿Piensas que estoy haciendo mal? - No lo creo – dijo – No puedes evitar gustarle a los demás y nunca le has mentido. Has sido sincera con él. No puedes hacer nada más y tampoco él te lo está pidiendo. Eres un buena amiga y por lo que dices él también lo ha sido, no tienen por qué cambiar las cosas. Además, él ha prometido no interferir en tu vida, a menos que te guste… ¿te gusta? - ¡¿Qué?! ¡NO! Es decir, es una linda persona y me hace sonreír pero no me gusta en ese sentido. Siento como si lo conociera y a veces tengo la sensación que él me conoce mejor que yo misma. Ella se queda mirando al techo pensativa. Odio esa cara, sé que está uniendo puntos y pronto saldrá alguna de sus locas ideas – Dices que no sabes de donde lo conoces y que tampoco él quiere decirte. También piensas que él te conoce mejor que tú misma. ¿No has pensado que… puede ser Josh? Empiezo a reír sin parar de una forma histérica. Parte de mí encuentro su comentario una estupidez y parte de mí, aunque no debería, le duele por la imposibilidad. - No sé qué te provoca tanta risa, Alexandra. Es lo más posible si me lo preguntas. Encaja perfecto en todo. Al ver su rostro serio me tranquilicé - ¿es en serio? Fer! Josh ya paso de mí como yo de él. Además no hay ninguna posibilidad de que él sepa que vivo aquí. - ¿Cómo sabes que no se lo dijo Connor? - Lo sé. Connor nunca me traicionaría y además dudo que a Joshua aún le importe algo de mí. - Espero que estés en lo cierto. No quiero ni imaginarme que sería de tu vida si este chico fuera él. - Solo es un amigo. No voy a cambiar a mi amoroso novio por nadie. - Eso espero. Darío te ama en verdad y no quiero verle herido. - Nunca lo haría. Lo amo también. Lo hacía. Amaba a mi novio. ¿Quién no podía amar a una persona tan dulce, sincera, cariñosa y especial? Sin duda yo lo amaba. Cogí mi celular lista para responder cuando me di cuenta que no tenía idea de que decirle. Tenía que agradecer el detalle, eso era seguro, pero no sabía cómo enfrentarme a esto de su enamoramiento. Tal vez no creía que era verdad o pensé que era algo platónico pero el detalle me indicaba algo grande. Me entran unas ganas de golpearme. Si en verdad este chico está enamorado de mí le he hecho mucho daño hablándole de mi novio y nuestra relación. Y se lo fatal que se siente eso. Lo experimenté en carne propia cuando Darío tenía novia y yo ella su \"amiga-con-quien-se-besaba-en-cada-encuentro\". Él me hablaba de su relación y yo no podía dejar de escuchar porque parte de mí se sentía importante para él. Pensaba que me consideraba de alguna forma para confiar en mí aunque eso me doliera. \"Gracias por el detalle\" fue lo que envié. 10 segundos más tarde tuve un mensaje de respuesta. No quería pensar que estaba ansioso por mi reacción. \"Estaba nervioso de q no te gustara. Feliz día hermosa :3 \" \"Por supuesto que me gustó. No sé cómo lo supiste pero las orquídeas y los lirios son mis favoritos ¿Xq las elegiste?\" no podía evitar la curiosidad. \"Me parecieron que van contigo. Las vi y supe que te gustaría, pero no puedo negar que estaba nervioso por equivocarme…\" \"Xq lo hiciste?\" tenía que preguntar y esperaba que entienda lo que quería decir. \"Xq? Lo sabes. No he ocultado lo que siento por ti\" \"No… no lo has hecho, pero siento que esto no está bien\" \"No digas eso x favor… no quiero perder esto. Te prometí no interferir pero no pude resistir darte las flores. Perdóname…\" Me sentí triste. Él se había vuelto de alguna manera mi confidente. Mi amigo, alguien que no me juzgaba y podía contarle todo, cosas que a veces no puedes decirle a otra persona. Tampoco quería perder eso. Era egoísta porque sabía que podía hacerle daño. \"Ntp. Las flores están hermosas. A veces siento q me conoces mejor q nadie\" \"Solo me dejo llevar x lo q m dicta el corazón\" No sabía que responder así que no lo hice. Trate todo el día de pensar en otras cosas sin lograrlo. Me sentí de una manera… extraña. Este chico era dulce, atento y… me moría por saber quién era, pero sabía que si llegaba a saber quién era la magia se terminaría. No me malinterpreten. Amaba tener un amigo como él y era lindo sentirse querida por alguien más. Si lo conocía no podría mirarlo de la misma manera, por algunas razones: 1. Podría querer pasar tiempo con él lo que conllevaría a darle razones para meterse en mi vida y complicarla; 2. Podría sentirme incómoda al conocerlo, descubrir que no es la persona que me imagino y perder a mi confidente; 3. AUNQUE NO LO CREO PERO ES UNA POSIBILIDAD, podría gustarme. Mucho. Mejor dejaba de pensar en todas esas cosas que solo complicaban mi existencia. Más tarde recibí un mensaje de mi novio diciendo \"feliz día\" y disculpándose por haberse olvidado. Me recompensaría la próxima semana cuando volviera. Sería unas largas noches sin él. Tomaba la merienda con Fer cuando mi celular vibró. - Oh Oooh. Creo que Romeo llama – le fulminé con mi mirada mientras leí el mensaje. \"Lo siento. Olvídalo todo, toma mi regalo como una muestra de mi sincera amistad. No soportaría perderte\" Lo pensé muy bien y mientras tecleaba el texto para decirle que no había problema recibí otro. \"Creo que debería contarte mi historia. La forma en que llegué a ti… si tú quieres escucharme\" Me agradó la idea. Quería saber sobre él. Yo había compartido mucho de mi vida y no tenía idea de quién era. \"Me gustaría escucharla… bueno técnicamente leerla\" \"Hagamos más interesante. Es una historia triste hasta que llego a la parte que entras en mi vida. Me resulta difícil contártela, que tal si te la cuento de poco a poco?\" \"Vale ;) \" \"Lo que en realidad me interesa es que sepas la forma en que me sentía. Eso te lo trasmitiré por canciones… te apuntas?\" \"Dale..! quiero tratar de descifrarte\" \"Tendré q hablart de ti. Promete que no te enfadarás\" \"Tranquilo, quiero escuchar todo, tal y como quieras decírmelo. Es la manera de conocerte mejor\" \"Ahí te va… Conocí a una niña que me volvió loco y me dio esperanzas de que tal vez podría ser feliz después de todo lo que he pasado… La vi una mañana caminar con un niño a comprar un helado. Vi como disfruta de esas pequeñas cosas como saborear aquel postre, levantar su rostro al sol, respirar el aire puro de la naturaleza; cosas que las personas muchas veces damos por sentado y no nos detenemos a analizar. Fue cuando comprendí que la quería en mi vida x siempre de cualquier manera, ya que solo con contemplar su sonrisa devolvió los colores a mi vida. Mi vida, que luego de tener un corazón roto se había vuelto monótona; solo consistía en respirar y hacer lo q tenía que hacer\" (Me and you – Fall out boy: www_youtube_com/watch?v=UkbJcGNfygs ) Sabía que se refería a mí y saberlo no me hizo sentir triste por él. De alguna forma logró asentar una calidez en mi corazón. Y fue así como empecé a descifrar a este niño. Hooola...! es mirécoles y no he escrito anda.. jaja ok estoy en eso..! Como les dije tendremos algunos de estos caps...! pero solo un par mas..! ¿Qué les parecio? y ¿QUE CREEN Q PASARÁ? Es obvio q habrá un reencuentro ¿cómo creen q serán? Gracias x sus reviews y mensajes...! es muy importante para mí q los lean y saber q piensan..! Gracias x sus deseos.. estoy tratando de acomodarme a mis nuevos horarios pero no se preocupen..no dejaré la historia.. tengo ideas muy claras para avanzar pero aun no decido el final. No les aseguro q sea algo feliz o triste, o q ella se quede o no con Josh.. eso dependerá de como vaya la historia..! Como me preguntaron si estudio medicina estoy en 4to año.. solo me kedan 3 ciclos para terminar :P asi q perdonen si meto mucho de esto en la historia, creanme q trato q sea entendible para los lectores q no saben del tema :P -z3 Nos leemos luego ...MILET.. AVANCE: Y quiero que ud ya sepa cómo estoy yo con esta alegría en el corazón, que usted me regala escuchando esta canción. SOLO QUERÍA DECIRLE UD ES HERMOSA…[Chapter 73] Capítulo 73 Amaba poder saber de ella y de alguna manera hacerle saber cómo me sentía con respecto a lo que nos sucedió. A lo que era mi vida sin ella. Me sentí mal cuando tenía que mentir ciertas cosas para que no se diera cuenta, pero trataba que fuera lo mínimo. Trataba de dejar cosas abiertas para que ella llenara los espacios como mejor le convenía a su mente. - ¿Por qué tan feliz hijo? – me preguntó mi mamá. Obviamente debía notar mi gran sonrisa luego de pasar largos ratos chateando con Alex. No hablábamos siempre de mi historia. Le dije que le iría contando de poco a poco. Ella dijo que me tomara el tiempo necesario pero de alguna forma no podíamos dejar de escribirnos. Parecería que ya no hubieran temas, pero siempre teníamos algo nuevo que contarnos y discutirnos. - La vida es bella, mamá. ¿Por qué no sonreír? – suspiré lo que la hizo sonreír. - No es que no me alegre verte así, pero quisiera saber a qué se debe – dijo mientras revolvía los huevos para mi desayuno favorito. Omelette. - ay Mamá – suspiré – solo el amor puede hacer un mundo tan maravilloso. - Mmhmm Amor. ¿Así que hay una chica? – metí la pata. Ahora me interrogará hasta que suelte la sopa. - Sí… hay una chica – admití – pero no te pienso decir nada más que eso. - Entonces no se trata de Claudia ¿verdad? - Nopi- dije divertido mientras empezaba a devorar mis huevos. - En realidad no interesa quien sea. Lo que importa es que luego de mucho tiempo te veo feliz. Luces diferente… radiante. En mucho tiempo no te veía así. Pensé que no te recuperarías de perder a Alexandra, muchas veces quise buscar a esa chica y hacerla reaccionar, pero me alegra que hayas encontrado a una nueva persona a quién querer. Estoy orgullosa de ti por avanzar. Si supieras mamá. Si supieras que nunca podré dejar de amar a esta chica. Ella es la única razón para ser feliz. La única que podré amar y me hace sentir completo. - No diré nada – no quería mentir. Salté de mi asiento y corrí a mi habitación mientras mi mamá me llamaba. Era inevitable que se diera cuenta que algo no andaba bien. Me imagino que mi niña debe estar ya en su trote mañanero. Llamo a la florería más cercana y pido mi orden junto con el mensaje. Más tarde estoy llamando a Steven para arreglar los últimos detalles de mi nuevo proyecto. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Estaba llegando a mi departamento. Subía estas tormentosas escaleras hasta el tercer piso. Tenía que hacer deporte pero no me agradaba la idea. Era de esas personas que prefería estar en la cama todo el día pero era médico y recomendaba a mis pacientes hacer ejercicio, muy hipócrita de mi parte no seguir mi consejo. Llegué a la puerta de mi apartamento y encontré un pequeño ramillete de orquídeas pequeñas de varios colores. La recogí y encontré una pequeña tarjeta. Entré en mi departamento mientras leía la tarjeta. El computador de Santy estaba en nuestra mesa de computador así que lo encendí. Ingreso el link mientras escuchó la melodía. (Usted es hermosa – Fausto Miño: www_youtube_com/watch?v=xCbsRl0R6vM ) \"Y quiero que ud ya sepa cómo estoy yo con esta alegría en el corazón, que usted me regala escuchando esta canción. SOLO QUERÍA DECIRLE UD ES HERMOSA… no sabes cómo quisiera decírtelo en persona… lindo día, princesa\" Una pequeña sensación de calidez se asentó en mi pecho. Este chico cursi puede conquistar a quien quiera con sus detalles. Busco un jarrón para las orquídeas y los coloco sobre la mesita junto a mi cama. Saliendo de mi habitación me encuentro con Santiago tomando su desayuno. - Buen día – me saluda metiéndose una tostada en la boca. - Hola Melenudo – digo frotando sus rizos alborotados. - Basta. No inicies una guerra que no podrás terminar. - No me retes – dije mientras me servía un poco de yogurt y me sentaba frente a él. Me quedó mirando como si me inspeccionara de pies a cabeza - ¿qué? - Casi no te he visto últimamente y ahora noto algo diferente. Te veo más… delgada. ¿Estás haciendo una de esas dietas como Fernanda? Últimamente nunca nos encontramos. Cuando tengo turnos nocturnos ellos los tienen durante el día y visceversa. - Naaaaa ya sabes que mi único placer en esta vida es comer. - Si – sonrió maliciosamente – sobre todo a mi hermano. - Eso es un tema que no voy a tratar contigo. - ¿Por qué no? Podría darles algunos consejos sobre todo porque quiero un compañerito de juego para Ana – le envié una de esas miradas matadoras – Vale. Como te iba diciendo te noto más delgada. Es como cuando vez a alguien a los tiempos y te das cuenta de esos cambios que no notas cuando pasas a diario con esa persona ¿has estado enferma? - No para nada. Tal vez es el montón de estrés que me ha hecho perder peso, pero estoy bien. - ¿Segura? – preocupación se refleja en sus ojos. - Segura – con un beso de despedida se va a sus clases. Tomo una ducha rápida y rápidamente tomo mi celular. \"Gracias el detalle\" \"¿te gustó?\" \"Claro\" \"Y la canción?\" \"Muy hermosa… gracias\" \"No tienes q agradecer… sabes q es lo q pienso. Qué tal si te cuento un poco más de mi historia?\" \"Vale, pero ya no quiero que me hables de mí… quiero saber más\" \"Conocí a esta chica un día de invierno. Suena a poesía pero es como lo recuerdo. Recuerdo que era un día un poco frío a pesar de que el sol brillaba pero ella trajo esa calidez a mí. Era hermosa, me impresionó. No se dejó intimidar x mí actitud de macho alfa. Me puso en mi lugar al mismo tiempo que robó mi corazón. Quise conocerla y así me fui enamorando. Cometí muchos errores, muchas estupideces y perdí muchas oportunidades con ella. Pero de alguna manera logré q me amara y me aceptara en su vida…\" \"¿te amó? Ya no lo hace? Xq?\" \"Muchas preguntas que te las iré respondiendo de poco a poco. Aunque no sé si aún lo hace. Solo te diré q cometí muchos errores, además de q el destino contribuyó en quitármela\" \"El destino puede ser cruel…\" \"A veces… pero también te regala nuevas oportunidades y esta vez no pienso cometer los mismo errores\" Las semanas pasaron y mi vida seguí siendo complicada. En el sentido de que todo era ajetreado, mi trabajo, estudio todo se confabulaba para no darme un momento libre. Y no era solo yo, así era la vida de todos a mí alrededor. Había momentos en que quería gritar porque no tenía a nadie con quien desahogarme y luego recordaba a este chico que se había ganado parte de mi corazón solo por mensajes. Hoy era mi noche libre y mañana tampoco tenía nada de trabajo-clases. Decidí empezar un buen libro. Las horas se pasaron volando, me sumergí completamente en él. Era una historia sobre un chico que tuvo un accidente y cuando despertó en una clínica una chica, que aparentemente era una paciente, le dijo que había quedado paralítico. Él por supuesto sintió morir. Se dio cuenta de muchas cosas que sucedían a su alrededor con respecto a su vida y al mismo tiempo conoció a esta chica que se llamaba Olivia quién lo intrigaba y le fascinaba. Pero había algo que no concordaba y yo me estaba desesperando por saber que era cuando la puerta se abrió y mi novio me miraba desde el umbral de la puerta. Sonreí. Había extrañado mucho tenerlo. La beca que había ganado lo tenía prácticamente todos los fines de semana fuera, en alguna otra ciudad con obras monumentales que tenía que estudiarlas, al igual que sus lunes-viernes llenos de proyectos.. - Hola – dijo con una voz sensual aun parado en el umbral de la puerta. - Hola – dije suavemente mientras colocaba el separador de hojas y dejaba mi libro en la mesita junto a nuestra cama - ¿No deberías estar a cientos de kilómetros de mí? - Supongo, pero decidí ceder mi puesto a otra persona porque quiero pasar el cumpleaños de mi sexy y ardiente novia con ella. Tenía razón. Mañana es 23 de marzo y sería mi cumpleaños. Lo había olvidado completamente. 23 años. ¿Quién lo diría? Hubo una etapa de mi vida que no pensé ni llegar a los 12. Se acercó lentamente, se subió en la cama. Empezó a besar mi pie derecho y subió dejando besos y mordiscos por mi pierna hasta cernirse completamente sobre mí. - Te he extrañado mucho – susurre cuando su rostro estaba sobre el mío. Y era verdad. Extrañaba su cercanía, sus caricias. No solo el sexo, claro que extrañaba eso también, extrañaba tenerlo junto a mí. - Yo también a ti. Tenemos toda esta noche para desquitar estos 3 meses de abstinencia. - ¿3 meses? – Pregunté divertida -¿Estás contando? - 3 meses y cuatro días. Por supuesto que estoy contando. Nos besamos y desatamos todo el anhelo que hemos guardado el uno por el otro. Amaba la manera que me hacía sentir, la forma en que acariciaba mi cuerpo como si lo adorara. Somos muy buenos juntos. Como era de suponerse, mi primera noche libre en mucho tiempo no estuvo muy tranquila que digamos. Mis planes de un sueño profundo se vieron ocupados por otros placeres. Y cuando el sol se filtraba aun estábamos en otra ronda. Darío gimió mi nombre cuando llegó a su orgasmo un instante luego del mío. Cayo a un lado y rápidamente me envolvió en sus brazos mientras tratábamos que nuestra respiración se normalice. - Eso… estuvo bien – soltó una suave risa con mi comentario. - Creo que no hice mi trabajo lo suficientemente bien. Esperaba un \"Excelente\" \"fabuloso\" \"eres una semental\" - Debes estar bromeando ¿semental? – pregunté soltando risas. Él depositó un beso en mi frente. - ¿Dónde está tu hermano y Fer? - Los convencí para que tengan una noche lejos de nosotros. Creo que fueron con Alyson a su casa de campo o algo así en las afueras de la ciudad. Necesitaba darte tu regalo de cumpleaños. - Y fue un muy buen regalo – nos besamos dulcemente. - Espero que no tengas quejas. Hice mi mejor esfuerzo. - ¿Sobre qué tengo que quejarme? Logré llegar a un millón de orgasmos provenientes de chico ardiente. - ¿lo hiciste? – sonrió con malicia – un chico ardiente ¿eh? ¿Alguien que conozca? - Tal vez lo conozcas. Tiene un cabello rubio oscuro muy suave y los más increíble ojos verdes que jamás haya visto. Una sonrisa adictiva y una voz profunda que me vuelve loca. ¿Te suena familiar? Puso un rostro de \"lo estoy pensando\" lo que logró que pusiera los ojos en blanco – No. No lo conozco. - ¿Seguro? Bueno, también es un increíble besador, muy inteligente y dulce ¿mencioné que tiene unos asesinos abdominales definidos? Darío se echó a reír mientras me coloca sobre su cuerpo. – Como dije, él es jodidamente increíble. Incluso es un estupendo amante. Eso es mucho contra que competir. - Sí, estoy seguro de que lo es. ¿Salta edificios muy altos de un solo salto, puede volar por los cielos o tiene súper fuerza? - No lo creo. Y te aseguro que no tiene visión de rayos X porque de ser así no le emocionaría tanto quitarme la ropa. - Ningún hombre se resistiría a verte sin ropa. ¿Dijiste que era un buen amante? – me dejó acostada contra la cama y volvió a cernirse sobre mí – Tengo una competancia que ganar, nena. Y volvimos por otra ronda de grandioso, estupendo y fabuloso sexo. Sin duda, amaba a mi semental. Hoola... no me maten.. sali de viaje y llegué en la madrugada... luego fui a clases y recién tengo oportunidad.. tengo q ir a hacer turno en el hospital, pero les dejo x akí. espero sus opiniones y predicciones... la fecha del cumple de Alex se me ocurrió xq analice q había dado pistas y deía ser entre el mes de marzo y abril entonces escogíesta xq tiene q ver algo con THG.. espero q se den cuenta q relacion tiene :P :) gracias x leer y xfa dejen sus reviews :) los amoooo :) nos leemos luego -z3 MILET AVANCE: Cuando di la vuelta para enfrentarla ella me sorprendió abalanzándose sobre mí. Sus labios hicieron contacto con los míos.[Chapter 74] Capítulo 74 Puede que mi novio había rechazado su viaje pero tenía que ir a la universidad. No habíamos dormido pero aun así se bañó y se fue a clases. Hacía un lindo día y no tenía que hacer así que me dispuse a ir al parque. Le había dicho a Darío de mis planes y él me alcanzaría para el almuerzo ahí. Traería nuestra comida. Tomé mi guitarra, hacía tiempo que no tocaba, no quería perder la práctica luego de lo mucho que me costó aprender. Si, había aprendido a no destrozar mi guitarra y todo el mérito se lo debo a mi novio y sus incentivos. Cuando cerraba la puerta de mi apartamento me encontré con mi amiga Alyson quien me recibió con un abrazo de oso por mi cumpleaños y un pequeño obsequio que guardé en mi bolsa. Le invité a ir conmigo al parque. Nos instalamos en un pequeño claro y toqué las canciones que ella pedía. - Amo como cantas Alex. En serio. Tienes que preparar una canción para mi súper fiesta de cumpleaños. - Ni loca, rubia. He tenido suficiente de presentaciones musicales en mi vida. - Vamos no puedes negarte. Es mi cumpleaños. - No tengo tiempo para practicar-buscaba alguna excusa convincente. - Falta casi 4 meses. Solo una canción, por favor – hizo su típico puchero que nunca fallaba en mí. - Vale. Pero tu buscarás la banda y le diras que canción practiquen. - Lo tengo todo arreglado. Hablamos de otras cosas y de un momento a otro, se puso de pie. - Me tengo que ir. Nos vemos luego. No me dio tiempo de despedirme cuando la vi corriendo en dirección fuera del parque. Seguí tocando y cantando aquellas melodías que relajaban. (Love Story – Taylor Swift: www_youtube_com/watch?v=7fxQk_Tjxu4 ) - Ya llego tu Romeo – la voz de mi novio me sorprendió. Le sonreí – pensé que llegarías más tarde. - Una clase se suspendió así que tuve tiempo de ir por tu regalo y venir antes. - Creí que tu regalo me lo habías dado anoche. - Eso solo fue el calentamiento – puso mi guitarra a un lado y me cernió sobre mí – Pero si quieres repetición, puedo dártela. Envolví mis brazos alrededor de su cuello - Solo una probadita – y por supuesto probé el sabor de sus labios en ese hermoso lugar. Mi chico dulce me había comprado un lindo collar con un dije en forma de corazón con la piedra del mes de mi nacimiento. Comimos los sándwiches que trajo y pasamos toda la tarde cantando. Juntos. Era más de lo que podía pedir. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O No tenía ni idea de que obsequiarle. No podía dejar pasar su cumpleaños. Nunca pude festejarlo con ella, siempre arruiné las cosas antes de que llegue el día. Fui a la joyería. Quería algo que ella pueda usar pero no encontré nada que me parezca especial para ella. De alguna manera fui a dar en un centro artesanal. Anduve por todos los puestos hasta que unos pequeños colgantes. Era plata. Una larga cadena sencilla muy delicada con un único colgante. – Es un llamador de ángeles – dijo el dueño del puesto. El dije consiste en una bola de plata con diseños. Dentro de ella hay una piedra preciosa. - Son talismanes. La leyenda dicen que tienen la facultad de proteger a quien lo posee y de favorecer su bienestar. Hubo uno que me llamó la atención. El diseño en plata tenía aspecto de enredaderas que enjaulaban a un círculo mitad rojo y mitad rosa. El dueño me dijo que era rubí y cuarzo rosado. La primera piedra se utiliza para abrir el corazón y fomentar el amor y la segunda conocida como la piedra del \"amor gentil\", traía la paz y la calma a las relaciones y también era excelente para curar las heridas emocionales, disipar la negatividad y restaurar la armonía después del conflicto. Perfecto. - Es un regalo hermoso. No solo por lo que representan las piedras si no por el hecho de que regales un llamador de ángeles muestras tu interés por la seguridad de esa persona. Me habló sobre la historia de estos. Los llamadores de ángeles producen un sonido armonioso y agradable, como el de unas campanitas, que según la tradición, atrae y avisa a nuestro Ángel de la Guarda de que necesitamos su presencia. A los ángeles les encanta este sonido, probablemente por la transmisión de las vibraciones metálicas y gráciles; si, además, es utilizado por un humano, los ángeles reciben un mensaje extra que les informa de que están siendo llamados por un ser al que aman. La leyenda cuenta que, hace miles de años, los humanos vivían en contacto directo con sus Ángeles de la Guarda, y que por alguna razón seguramente vinculada al Pecado Original, tuvieron que dejar de vivir conjuntamente con ellos. Los ángeles, apenados por la pérdida de la compañía de los humanos, los seres que más amaban, obsequiaron a éstos con colgantes esféricos de plata para que al agitarlos sonaran como campanillas. Estas esferas eran un símbolo de protección. Los ángeles se despidieron de los humanos y les explicaron que, aunque ya no los volvieran a ver, si se sentían en peligro, desprotegidos o simplemente tristes, sólo necesitaban agitar la esfera, ya que, cuando escuchara su sonido, el ángel de cada uno acudiría en su ayuda o compañía. Me perdí en el armonioso sonido que emitía y sabía que había encontrado algo verdaderamente especial y significativo para mi niña. Sin duda lo compré. Ahora tenía que planear como dárselo. Compré un lirio stargazer y até una pequeña bolsita con el amuleto a él. La pusieron dentro de una caja y envolvieron con un moño rojo. Partí hacia su casa buscando la manera de hacerle llegar mi regalo. Diera mi vida por poder dárselo personalmente, pero por ahora tendría que conformarme. Me detuve en seco cuando la vi salir con su amiga. Se veía feliz. Hace muchos días que no la había visto sonreír de esa manera. Las seguí, era algo involuntario. Las vi acomodarse en el suelo y cantar. Fue cuando noté la guitarra sentí una punzada de añoranza. Recuerdo las veces que habíamos terminado haciendo el amor debido a que ella no lograba tocar y busca la forma de distraerme para no insistir. Estoy seguro de que Darío fue quién se encargó de enseñarle. La idea de ellos haciendo lo mismo que nosotros no se veía bonita en mi mente. Su amiga que si mal no recuerdo se llama Alyson se despide de ella y empieza a caminar hacia mí. Trato de ocultarme tras el árbol en que estoy esperando que ella pase de largo pero no lo hace. Estaba Jodido. - Mira a quien tenemos aquí – se puso justo frente a mí – Joshua Ryan Hutcherson. Sabía que eras tú. No sabía que responderle. Había sido atrapado y lo único que podía pensar era en cómo evitar que mi plan se vaya por los suelos. Nos quedamos por unos minutos mirándonos. Ella adoptó una postura con sus manos en su cadera y yo decidí darle la espalda. No podía pensar con sus ojos escudriñándome. Vi a Alex cantar, de cierta forma su imagen me tranquilizaba. Ahora trataría de convencer a esta chica de que no diga nada. Cuando di la vuelta para enfrentarla ella me sorprendió abalanzándose sobre mí. Sus labios hicieron contacto con los míos. No pude reaccionar, todo esto me parecía irreal. Fue cuando ella me empujó contra el árbol que traté de apartarla pero ella no lo permitía. Estaba aferrada a mí como un mono a su mamá. Fue cuando escuché una voz a mis espaldas que comprendí todo. - Vamos Alyson, por lo menos llévatelo a una habitación. Es de mal gusto ver esos espectáculos. - Tú haces lo mismo con Alex, Darío. Así que ahórrate los comentarios – vi como ella miraba a Darío por sobre mi hombro. Le saco la lengua – No le digas a tu novia, no quiero charlas. - Vale. Nos vemos, Ally – ella dijo adiós con su mano – Nos vemos chico, no dejes que ella te devore. Levanté mi mano en señal de victoria y escuché sus pasos alejarse. - Eso estuvo cerca – dijo Alyson apartándose de mí – SI no hubiera estado aquí, ese chico te hubiera encontrado y no quiero pensar lo que habría pasado. - Gracias – murmuré. Había sido irresponsable y nada precavido. - Vamos – ella tomó mi mano – Tienes mucho que explicar. Me deje guiar por ella al complejo de departamentos. Me llevó al que supongo es el suyo. - El departamento de abajo es donde vive Alex – dijo cerrando la puerta – por si necesitabas saber. Asentí. Mi mente estaba en blanco y solo estaba esperando que mi mente idee algo para salir de este aprieto. –Te pusiste pálido. Tranquilo, no voy decir nada. - ¿No lo harás? – pregunté esperanzado. - Nop. Aunque debería echarte de cabeza por rechazar de esa manera mi beso. Lastimaste mi ego. Me tomo un instante darme cuenta que estaba bromeando. – Lo siento por eso, pero la única chica que quiero besar ni siquiera piensa en mí. - No creo eso. Creo que ella siente algo por ti, todavía, aunque no lo admita o no lo sepa ni ella. - ¿Te ha dicho algo? ¿Te ha hablado de mí? - Solo un resumen de su relación el día de la premier. Por cierto, debería patearte en las pelotas por engañarla. No puedo creer que seas de esos hombres. - No lo soy – empecé a exasperarme. Estoy cansado de que crean que soy el malo de la película. – No la engañé. No sé qué sucedió estoy seguro de que me drogaron, yo nunca le haría eso a la persona que amo. Alexandra es todo para mí. Pero ella no me creyó, desconfió de mí y tuve que dejarla ir. Suspiré. – No sé cómo he llegado hasta aquí sin ella. No sé cómo he vivido desde que me dejo pero no pienso volver a cometer esa estupidez. Quiero recuperarla. - Ella tiene a Darío. - ¿Crees que no lo sé? Ella le dio una nueva oportunidad y sé que él la merece porque nunca se rindió. Pero yo también merezco una nueva oportunidad, yo también merezco ser feliz y sé que ella fue feliz conmigo. No es justo lo que sucedió. - La vida no siempre es justa - me dijo – Voy a decirte lo que yo veo. Creo en todo ese rollo de las almas gemelas, en que a pesar de las cosas el destino se encargará en juntarlos. – Tomo aire y su rostro se tornó serio – Cuando conocí a Alex y Darío supe que se querían. Él la miraba con total entrega y devoción; ella lo miraba con cariño pero no de la misma forma que él. Aun así es fácil darse cuenta que se quieren. - Eso no ayuda a sentirme mejor. - Cállate y escúchame – su actitud me hizo sonreír. Empezaba a caerme bien esta chica – No es por presumir pero soy de esas personas con mucha percepción. Como te dije sabía que ellos se querían y es obvio que se desean. Hay veces que se pegan unas escapadas para… - Al punto – gemí. No podía seguir escuchando. La simple idea de ellos juntos me revolvía el estómago. - Ups. Lo siento. Bueno a pesar de eso me tomó solo un instante, solo una vista de ustedes 2 tan cerca, con sus miradas conectadas y supe que estaban destinados el uno para el otro. Fue algo irreal. Parecía que para ustedes el tiempo se detuvo y una burbuja los envolvió. No sabía cómo describir pero estoy segura de que son almas gemelas y de alguna manera estarán juntos. Quiero contribuir ahí. - ¿Qué puedes hacer tú? No me malinterpretes pero ni siquiera yo tengo idea de que hacer. No veo cómo puedes ayudarme. - Habrá maneras. Por lo pronto tienes una aliada. Dime que has hecho hasta ahora. Le conté todas las cosas que hemos hablado con Alex y también le di mi versión de la historia. Alyson era una chica vivaz llena de energía. Cuando se emocionaba me recordaba a esos niños hiperactivos que comían mucha azúcar. Hablamos mucho sobre mi tema favorito. Alex. Lo maravillosa que ella era y las cosas que me había perdido de su vida. Ally me sugirió que la enfrentará pero aún no estaba listo. Mi plan era ganármela. Ilusionarla, enamorarla, cualquier cosa, pero necesitaba un sentimiento de su parte hacia mí. Un sentimiento bueno. Por lo pronto me ayudo hacer llegar su regalo. Alyson tiene una llave de su departamento. Cuando entramos en aquel departamento me vi envuelto por una gran nostalgia. Había fotos de ellos por todos lados. No solo era Alex, también Santy y Fer con su pequeña. Envidiaba lo que ellos tenían. Hubiera dado todo en el mundo por estar en el lugar de ellos dos con Alex. Me detuve frente a una foto de Alex y Darío. Ella estaba cargada en su espalda envolviendo sus brazos alrededor del cuello de Darío. Están felices. Duele. La amo demasiado y no quiero que pierda, no quiero quitarle nada que la haga feliz. - No creo que ver eso te haga bien – dijo Ally. - ¿Estoy siendo egoísta? – Pregunté frustrado - ¿está mal querer tenerla para mí y hacerla feliz? La amo demasiado, Ally. Lo único que en verdad espero en esta vida es que ella sea feliz. Que todo lo que desee lo obtenga. No quiero pensar que yo fuera de su vida sea lo que se necesita para eso. - No pienses así. Tienes que hacerle frente a esto. Estoy completamente segura de que ella aun siente algo por ti. Tal vez ni ella se dé cuenta pero necesitas hacer que ella tomé una decisión. Como dijiste los suyo no fue justo y por eso mismo debes luchar contra eso. Si al final ella no te elige, pues deberás ser hombre y aceptarlo. Ahora debes darle una oportunidad – dijo dejando mi paquete sobre un sofá. - ¿Una oportunidad? - Una oportunidad de ser verdaderamente feliz. Una oportunidad de estar con la persona que en verdad ama. Una oportunidad de elegir con quien quedarse sin que el odio, el orgullo y los engaños la cieguen. Solo depende de ti darle eso. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Regresé al departamento con mi novio. Mis amigos habían llegado cuando entramos por la puerta. Ambos se acercaron a felicitarme por mi cumpleaños y me entregaron un pequeño presente. Mi perfume favorito. - Este paquete creo que es para ti – me dijo Fer señalando al sofá. Tomé el paquete. Lo abrí para encontrarme un hermoso lirio que tenía sujeto una pequeña bolsita. La abrí y encontré un llamador de ángeles. Era hermoso. Había querido conseguir por mucho tiempo uno y no había tenido una oportunidad. Era una joya preciosa y sabía perfectamente quien la había enviado aunque no tuviera tarjeta. - Eso se ve caro – dijo mi novio - ¿Quién lo envió? - No estoy segura – mentí. - Es un regalo con mucho valor sentimental. Quiero saber quién te lo envió – note que el tono de mi novio estaba lleno de enfado. Giré ara encontrarme con su rostro. Si, estaba celoso. - Creo que debe ser de Mathew – dijo Fernanda.- Aun cree que tiene oportunidad con Alex. Casi beso a mi amiga por su capacidad de improvisar. Mathew es nuestro vecino del piso de abajo. Tiene 11 años y vive con su papá. Es un amor de niño y presume que soy su novia. Era obvio que Fernanda se dio cuenta de quién me envió este regalo. Por eso la amo, porque siempre sabe cómo actuar. Es muy buena mintiendo a diferencia de mí. - Pues se gastó un buen dineral en eso… Hermano, ese chico quiere robarte a tu novia – dijo divertido Santiago. - ¿Debería preocuparme porque me cambies por un pequeño galán? – preguntó mi novio mientras tomaba el llamador de ángeles y lo colocaba en mi cuello. - Tal vez – respondí coqueta. Aliviada de que creyera esa mentira. Odiaba mentirle. Este asunto se me estaba empezando a ir de las manos. No pienso poner en peligro mi relación con Darío por algo que no me lleva a ningún lado. - Debería mostrarte lo que yo puedo hacer y ese pequeño no – me cargó en sus brazos y me llevó a nuestra habitación. Definitivamente no cambiaría a este chico con nadie. Hoola :) se que quieren matarme x no actualizar el miércoles pero creanme que no tenía ningun cap nuevo. espero no tener q retrasarme así nuevamente pero se acabaron estos caps tediosos :) muy pronto tendremo el gran reencuentro.. espero q me digan como creen q será..! ¿Q les pareció este cap? ¿Creen q Alex sienta algo aún x Josh? ¿Q hará JOsh para recuperarla? y ¡ que opinana de la nueva aliada de Josh?

Fer y yo trajimos la maleta de Darío desde el departamento, ya que él tiene que viajar a sus pasantías y no tenía tiempo de ir al departamento. - Mira. Es por allá- señalo mi amiga el letrero con una flecha que indicaba por donde debíamos ir. Caminamos hacia la cafetería, cuando entramos empezamos a buscar a mi novio desde la puerta. El sitio está repleto y luego de un momento me fije en una mata de cabello rubio muy familiar. Me fije en mi sexy novio que lucía una camisa ceñida a su cuerpo, de un tono verde militar que combinaba con sus ojos y un jean negro que se ajustaba perfectamente a sus piernas, sus muslos, su duro trasero…. Estaba empezando a calentarme. Él tenía sus manos entrelazadas con sus codos sobre la mesa. Fue cuando me fije a quien estaba prestando atención. Una rubia se encontraba sentada al otro lado de la pequeña mesa. Se veía emocionada mientras relataba su historia. Era delgada y su cabello de un rubio que casi era blanco; su figura aunque delgada tenía sus curvas. Reajustaba sus lentes sobre aquella nariz respingona, no podía obviar lo hermosa que era. Se balanceaba de adelante-atrás mientras relataba su historia. Con su dedo enrollaba un mechón suelto y batía sus pestañas constantemente. Un signo de coqueteo evidente. Algo hirvió e mi sangre. Vi a Darío hablar y pude ver la atención, la devoción y la dulzura con la que esta chica miraba a mi novio. Sin duda estaba enamorada. - Tienes pelea, muchacha – me dijo Fer. Le di una mirada mordaz y empecé a avanzar rápidamente hacia aquella mesa llevando la maleta a cuestas maniobrando porque no choque con nada en mi carrera. - Será genial ver todos esos rascacielos. Algún día juro construir uno de esos – dijo la rubia cuando me acerqué. Ella se veía tan emocionada y no dejaba de acariciar el brazo de mi novio. Tuve que carraspear para que me prestaran atención. Mi novio alzo la mirada y me sonrío. Espere que estuviera nervioso o algo por el estilo. Ella esta interesada en él y él le estaba dando alas. - Hola pequeña – se puso de pie para saludarme, su intención era darme un tímido beso pero cuando vi a la rubia mirarme con desdén aproveché para prenderme de sus labios y darnos de esos besos que siempre nos hacían terminar en la cama. - Ustedes son asquerosos – oí decir a Fernanda. Cuando nos separamos, él me miro extrañado. Giró hacia la rubia y le dio una mirada de disculpa lo que obviamente me provocó una explosión de ira. - Ahí está tu maleta. Disfruta tu viaje. – salí dispara de ahí. Más vale que nadie se atravesara en mi camino porque no iba a detenerme y estaba dispuesta a patear traseros. En algún momento perdí Fernanda pero era algo que no me interesaba. ¿Cómo se atrevía ese… estúpido a dejarle que esa oxigenada le toque? ¿No se supone que es solo mío? ¿Dónde está el amor que dice tenerme? Ash… Algo me empujó contra una puerta a mi derecha. Era un armario lleno de escobas, trapeadores y demás accesorios de limpieza. La puerta se cerró con un clic dejándome sumida en la oscuridad. Unos labios se cernieron sobre los míos y unas manos aferraron mi cadera contra ese cuerpo tan familiar, aquel cuerpo que tantas veces había recorrido y me había dado millares de placer. Los labios de mi novio dejaron los míos y empezaron a recorrer mi cuello haciendo que se escape de mí varios gemidos. Sus manos fueron a mis muslos y de un solo tirón me empujó contra una pared permitiéndome enrollar mis piernas alrededor de su cintura. - Eres mía, Alex… - susurró – y yo solo te pertenezco a ti. Recordé el motivo porque estaba enojada y me aparté de él de un solo empujón. Darío volvió a aprisionarme con su cuerpo y ni por más empujones ni golpes que daba se apartaba. – ¿Ya te cansaste? - No, pero lamentablemente tú eres más fuerte, solo son intentos en vano. - Bueno, ahora es mi turno – mi espalda estaba contra la pared y sus manos acariciaban mis mejillas. Posó su frente sobre la mía – No tienes por qué enojarte de esa manera. Ella no significa nada para mí. Solo es mi compañera y estábamos teniendo una charla común. No tienes por qué estar celosa. - Ja… ¿Quién dijo que estaba celosa? Mi enojo no tiene nada que ver contigo. - Vamos chiquita, no mientas. Vi tu mirada y tu reacción, la posesividad que marcaste en ese beso. Deberías saber que soy tuyo, no tienes por qué hacerlo de esa manera. Tú eres la dueña de mi vida y mi corazón. Nadie más puede distraerme de la manera que lo haces, nadie más puede hacerme tener esta necesidad por alguien como tú…- sus palabras eran susurradas y prácticamente sobre mis labios. – Admite que estabas celosa. Quiero saberlo, quiero saber que no soportas la idea de alguien más a mi lado; quiero saber de esa necesidad que tienes por mí… - Esa chica – dije frustrada – te tocaba, te veía como algo que le pertenecía. Y tú eres mío… Y lo besé para probar mi punto y Darío me correspondió con la misma devoción. El beso se nos escapaba de las manos, empezamos a acariciarnos por debajo de la ropa. Fue mi novio quien pudo detenernos antes de hacer algo indebido, mejor dicho, en el lugar indebido. - No tienes de que preocuparte, solo tengo ojos para ti, Alexandra. - Pero… pero ella está enamorada de ti y es hermosa y por lo que vi es divertida para poder tener tu atención. - Es una buena chica, es inteligente y si es guapa pero nadie podrá ocupar el lugar que tú tienes en mí. Ella es tímida y yo su único amigo, puede que este enamorada, pero no tiene ninguna oportunidad mientras estés tu aquí – dijo señalando su corazón. - Lo siento… me sentí insegura. Es que no quiero perderte, Darío. Te amo mucho y no puedo evitarlo. Solo la idea de tu y ella… y estarán juntos en Dallas, solos, casi un mes. No puedo solo ignorarlo – dije irritada. - Pues tendrás que confiar en mí como siempre. Nunca te he dado motivos para que no pienses que haría todo por ti y te sería fiel. Tenía razón. Él nunca me había dado motivos. Pero me era tan difícil confiar 100% en alguien. Ya me había hecho tanto daño una vez… - Confío en ti… Me beso y luego de un momento salimos de ahí. Lo vi partir con aquella chica, embarcarse en aquel avión. Estaría lejos de mí por un largo tiempo y ahora no solo estaría llena de añoranza sino también de dudas…. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O \"Trate tanto de que me perdone… no sabes la desesperación y la desolación que sentí cuando la deje ir. Muchas veces quería retractarme, buscarla, luchar por ella… tenía miedo de que me rechazara. Es estúpido xq ya la había perdido e intentarlo me daba más oportunidades pero no me atreví. Soñé que ella me buscaba, que ella recordaba todo lo q vivimos y todo lo q logramos juntos y no era yo quien la dejaba ir, era yo quien la reconquistaba… quisiera volver atrás...

Una canción empezó a sonar y fue como si mi mundo se hubiera detenido. (You and Me – Lifehouse: www_youtube_com/watch?v=rSTejLuYENM ) Mi mente record cada beso, cada caricia, cada susurro de amor. Recordó el sonido de las olas, el sonido de nuestros besos en medio de la noche. El latido de nuestros corazones y la forma que nuestras almas se entregaron. Lágrimas se acumularon en mis ojos y las vi caer sobre el papel. - ¿Estas bien? – me preguntó Fer. - Apaga eso – me puse de pie y prácticamente corrí hacia mi habitación. Cerré con llave y me eché a llorar. No entendía como una canción podía hacerme revivir todo eso con tanta claridad. Josh… No podía dejar de tenerlo presente a cada momento. Había días en los que cada detalle me recordaba lo que teníamos. Nunca me sentí sola cuando estaba con él, a pesar de que estaba lejos, a pesar de que no nos veíamos, él siempre estaba conmigo. Quiero superar eso, pero no puedo. No puedo olvidar cada cosa, no puedo dejar de pensar que en algún lugar él esta y podría aun amarme.

Le había prometido a Alyson cantar su canción favorita en su cumpleaños. Como la fista era de disfraces escogí un vestido de princesa color violeta con volantes blancos. Era muy ceñido, me hacía lucir sexy. Era estilo colonial. Esos vestidos con faldas anchas, corsé ajustado y un muy bondadoso escote el cual dejaba a la vista mi cuello y mis hombros, con sus pequeñas mangas que apenas cubrían 5 centímetro de mis brazos. La parte superior era encarrujada a nivel de mi busto y por debajo de este se extendía la gran y bombacha falda. El secreto de este vestido es que la falda era desprendible y por dentro lleva un conjunto del mismo color pero la blusa se extendía hasta mis caderas sonde partía la corta falda de color negro que llegaba a medio muslo. Había conseguido medias tipo malla que llegaban sobre mis rodillas donde tenía un pequeño lazo como detalle y acompañado de mis tacones, por supuesto. Esa era la parte sexy. Esta noche quería sentirme de esa manera. Algo dentro de mí quería salir, quería sentirse bonita. Fer me había conseguido una peluca de cabello liso color rojizo oscuro. Dijo que esta noche debería ser otra. Ella entendía lo que quería y no me juzgó por el hecho de querer ser admirada. A veces las mujeres queremos sentirnos deseadas. Mientras termina de poner los últimos ganchos para sostener mi nuevo cabello, mi computador emitió un pitido señal de invitación a videoconferencia. - Hola preciosa – dijo mi novio a través de la pantalla. - Hola, galán – respondí emocionada. Había pasado 2 semanas desde que se fue a Dallas. - Te ves hermosa. Creo que no deberías ir de esa manera, habrá muchos fijándose en ti y tratando de abordarte – me dijo serio. Mi chico estaba celoso. Fer había salido para dejarnos un poco de privacidad. – Pues no iría sola si mi novio estuviera aquí y no tomará cada oportunidad para irse lejos. - Vamos Alex, sabes que no es cierto. Solo estoy sacando el máximo provecho a mi beca. - Pero no necesitas tomar todas las pasantías que te ofrecen. – dije molesta – y mucho menos si tienes que viajar con rubias que se mueren por ti. - No vamos a tener esta pelea, Alexandra. No quiero pelear contigo, solo quería ver como estabas, desearte suerte, decirte lo mucho que te quiero… Mi ira estaba esfumándose ante sus palabras. Él nunca le había importado el mi horario ni mis deberes y yo le hacía problema por ellos solo porque me sentía sola y lo extrañaba. Fue cuando la puerta de su habitación se abrió y cierta rubia apareció con una caja de pizza. – Lo siento por la tardanza, la pizzería estaba repleta… Darío me miro y la miro a ella. Quería agarrarlos y darles unos buenos golpes. No podía creer eso. Él sabía cómo me sentía sobre ella y la metía a su habitación de noche para hacer quien sabe que cosas. La rubia me miró a través de la pantalla – Lo siento… yo volveré luego… Mire a Darío que intentaba decirme: - No es lo que parece, Alex… Lo interrumpí con un gran – Se acabó, Darío. Lo nuestro llegó hasta aquí – cerré la tapa de mi portátil con un gran golpe. Tomé 2 largos suspiros para retener mis lágrimas. No iba a llorar por nadie nunca más y tampoco iba a arruinar mi maquillaje. Mi celular empezó a sonar. No quería hablar con él. Decidí apagarlo y lanzarlo a algún lado. Me retoqué el brillo labial y me coloqué mi llamador de ángeles. Necesitaba que alguien cuide de mí. Salí de mi habitación. - ¿Que sucedió con Darío? Llamó y dijo que necesita hablar contigo. Le dije que te habías ido. - Terminamos. Y no quiero hablar de ello, Fernanda. – le dije antes de que empezara con el interrogatorio. - Encontré esto en la entrada – dijo mostrándome un nuevo lirio con una tarjetita. – Ese chico está loco por ti. Deberías cortarlo de raíz. - ¿Por qué iba a hacerlo? Ya no tengo novio y ese chico ha sido el único que demostrado verdadero interés en mí, últimamente – dije molesta. Me puse mi abrigo y fui a en busca de mi bolso. Regresando a la sala escuché la canción que seguramente estaba en aquella tarjeta. (Corazones Rotos – Tercer Mundo: www_youtube_com/watch?v=zF5GU8CrGh0 ) La letra me llegó pero no entendía lo que quería decirme. Normalmente este chico cuando me dedicaba una canción me enviaba un mensaje adicional explicándome la parte que quería que escuchara o tuviera significado, pero esta vez la tarjeta solo decía \"Otra vez estoy aquí, para ver si esta vez, tal vez, puedo convencerte q vuelvas…-R\" Esta vez no era una declaración de amor… era un mensaje que se podía interpretar de miles de maneras. - Nos vemos luego – dije a mi amiga mientras salía por la puerta. La música aún sonando. Algo dentro de mí me decía que esta noche cambiaría mi vida nuevamente. Hooola :) actualicé asi que no me maten.. les pido paciencia en cuanto al capítulo que actualizo entre semana. Les diré que lo que hice en este cap planeaba hacerlo en varios capítulos pero como les dije me pareció q es sería muy aburrido. En verdad quiero saber que creen que va a pasar. el próximo cap les dará una idea mas clara del reencuentro. recien lo terminé. pense hacer el reencuentro en aquel cap pero me en cuanto me di cuenta ya había escrito 4 páginas asi que esperarán una cap mas :P Quiero saber sus predicciones... quiero saber que esperan de la novela y q creen q sucederá... cmo les dije tengo las ideas claras sobre que pasará y creo q les gustará.

No sabía cómo actuar y no sabía la reacción que ella tendría al volverme a ver. No sé cómo hablarle y ni cómo actuar a su alrededor. Lo único de lo que estoy seguro es que será pronto. No sé qué cambió en nuestra relación pero me estoy desesperando del hecho que ya no me responda. Quizá descubrió quien soy o tal vez crucé la línea en algún momento, pero necesito saber de ella y ya veo que lo que he tenido hasta ahora no me llevará a ningún lado.[Chapter 76] Capítulo 76 Estaba sentado en una esquina de este bar observándola. Tenía ojeras y la veía más delgada aun. Era preocupante verla en ese estado. Estaba con Alyson. Ella me había llamado y me dijo donde estarían. Así que vine inmediatamente solo para sentirla cerca y experimentar esa sensación de calidez en mi pecho que se desata solo con verla. Ambas estaban en una pequeña mesa junto al escenario donde un chico cantaba una lenta balada acompañado de su guitarra. Las veía hablar, reír. Amaba poder apreciar nuevamente su sonrisa. Ideas de mí quitándome esta gabardina, las gafas y el gorro, ir hacia ella, tomarla entre mis brazos y besarla llenaban mi mente y hacía latir mi corazón con más fuerza. Ya no podía estar lejos de ella. Ya no me conformaba con simples mensajes, con miradas furtivas desde lejos. Necesitaba más. Necesita tenerla de alguna manera. Cualquiera que sea la manera. La vi ponerse de pie y acercarse al escenario. Habló con el chico que ya había terminado su canción. Él le dio su guitarra y ella subió al escenario sentándose en un taburete. Acomodó la guitarra y acercó el micrófono a su boca. Volvería a escucharla cantar. No podía evitar sentirme emocionado. El chico de la guitarra se colocó en la batería que estaba también ahí y le dio una señal a Alex para empezar. El golpeteo de los instrumentos empezó y mucha de la gente de otras mesas emitió silbidos. Y yo espere escuchar la dulce voz de la niña de mis ojos. (Monsson – Tokio Hotel: www_youtube_com/watch?v=k0xav3SDGWU ) . Me perdí en su rostro y en sus expresiones. Me perdí en la pasión que ponía en cantar. Me perdí en el anhelo que me invadía por no poder estrecharla. Nunca debí dejarla ir. Hice lo más fácil y rompí mi promesa. Le dije que siempre lucharía incluso si era contra ella y fue exactamente lo que no hice. Termina la canción y hace una pequeña reverencia por los aplausos del público. Obviamente los cautivó con su talento. Se acerca a Alyson y se despide. La veo salir apresurada del lugar y estoy dispuesto a seguirla cuando una mano me detiene. Alyson me indica que vamos a la mesa donde estaba antes. Aunque quiero ir tras mi niña sé que no resolveré nada. - Ya no puedo más, Alyson. Ya no me conformo con seguir así. Quiero poder estar con ella, hablarle. Quiero ser parte de su vida, maldita sea. - Esa es tu decisión, Josh. Pero debes saber que una vez que lo hagas las cosas no son seguras. Puedes ganar como perder. - Pero me siento peor sin hacer nada. Quiero luchar, quiero pelear por ella, no me importa si eso significa ir contra ella. Alyson me sonrío – Esa es la actitud. Tenía que pensar en que iba a hacer y que iba a decirle. No sabía cómo actuar y no sabía la reacción que ella tendría al volverme a ver. No sé cómo hablarle y ni cómo actuar a su alrededor. Lo único de lo que estoy seguro es que será pronto. No sé qué cambió en nuestra relación pero me estoy desesperando del hecho que ya no me responda. Quizá descubrió quien soy o tal vez crucé la línea en algún momento, pero necesito saber de ella y ya veo que lo que he tenido hasta ahora no me llevará a ningún lado. Luego de pensarlo toda la noche, lo que obviamente me dejo una ojeras horribles, decidí que este sábado sería el gran día. Ese día ella tendrá que ir a su trabajo voluntario en el refugio de animales. No podrá escapar si piensa hacer, no podrá recurrir a su novio porque está de viaje; así que tendrá que escuchar todo lo que tengo que decir. Que es lo que exactamente no sé. Cuando amaneció apenas pude contener mi entusiasmo y prácticamente corrí hacia aquel refugio. Tuve esperar casi media hora hasta que el letrero de Cerrado cambiara. Una señora de unos 60 años según cálculo me atiende. Me recuerda a mi abuela por su calidez. Le dije que mi nombre es Ryan y como supuse no me reconoció lo que sería de gran ayuda para evitar la prensa y por supuesto dañar mi sorpresa. Le dije mi interés de colaborar un día. Me explico que la ayuda se repartía en 3 grupos por cada día, por lo que tendría que venir cada dos semanas. Pareciera que el mundo confabula a mi favor. Me ofreció 2 turnos en los que podía trabajar que según entendí eran los únicos en los que faltaba personal. - El turno 3 del viernes le falta una persona para completar el grupo aunque quisiera que de haber la posibilidad te inscribieras en el grupo 2 de los sábados. Estábamos completos pero 2 de los chicos pidieron un cambio de grupo debido a sus trabajos y solo quedó una de las chicas. Aunque no lo creas el sábado es un día tranquilo pero no es justo que todo ese trabajo lo haga una sola chica. - Claro, los sábados son perfectos para mí – no podía ocultar mi maldito entusiasmo al saber mi suerte. Trabajaré solo con ella. - Te caerá muy bien Alexandra, es una chica muy trabajadora y entusiasta. - Estoy seguro – luego de arreglar todo lo necesario me despedí y empecé a buscar la manera de que él sábado llegara lo más rápidamente. Mi mamá vino de visita y trató de sacarme la razón de que permaneciera en Boston y no haya ido a casa. Tenía métodos de persuasión muy drásticos, como esconder las llaves de mi moto, no hacerme mis hot-cakes, pero de alguna manera resistí. Mañana sería sábado y estaba demasiado impaciente. Alex no me había respondido ningún mensaje y estaba seguro que cuando nos encontráramos ataría cabos , si es que no lo ha hecho ya, y sabrá que su \"amigo-enamorado-del-chat\" se trata de mí así que siento la necesidad de darle alguna señal para que tenga más tiempo de asumirlo y nos ahorre un poco de preguntas. OK. La verdad es que quiero que se entere lo más pronto posible que estoy de regreso en su vida. Cuando me preparé para dormir y supe que llego el momento de pelear. Tendría que vencer esa tenacidad y esas barreras que ella seguramente pondrá para protegerse y apartarme. Será la lucha más difícil de mi vida. Pretendo ganarla pero aún no sé qué estrategia usar. ¿Cómo vences a la persona que amas? Cerré mis ojos luego de haber hecho una oración a Dios, al universo incluso a Buda si es que existe. Necesitaría todo el apoyo del universo para lo que vendría a partir de aquí. Mis párpados pesaban y mi cabeza daba vueltas cuando abrí mis ojos. Sentí mi garganta reseca y dolía. Traté de hablar pero eso dolía aún más. Connor entró a la habitación y abrió mis cortinas. – Es hora que te levantes o llegarás tarde a donde sea que vayas. Gemí cuando la luz llegó a mis ojos – Tienes mal aspecto, hermano. Mamá… Grito y quería darle un gran golpe por hacer a mi cabeza sufrir aún más. Mi mamá atravesó la puerta y rápidamente se apresuró a tomarme la temperatura. Su mano se sentía fría contra mi piel caliente. – Voy a llamar a un médico. No te muevas de esa cama. - Alto – exclamé. Sentí que mi garganta se desgarró y mi voz sonaba muy gruesa. – Solo tráeme un espejo y un baja lengua. Connor se echó a reír y fue a mi baño a traer lo que pedía. - ¿Ahora te crees médico? – dijo entregándome las cosas. Tome el abaja lenguas y me observé en el espejo. Amigdalitis. Había pasado el suficiente tiempo con Alex para saber identificar una infección tan común. Había pasado horas ayudando a que memoricé medicamentos, dosis y tratamientos. Sabía que para mí afección necesitaba tomar una tableta de 400mg de ibuprofeno cada 8 horas por 3 días para la fiebre e inflamación y tomar antibióticos. Podía optar por una ampolla de penicilina de 1'2 lo que tendría que hacerlo un doctor ya que ni en la farmacia tienen permitido inyectar sin receta médica y nadie conocido lo haría. Pero si podía comprar amoxicilina. Tabletas de 500mg cada 8 horas por 3-5 días y estaría como nuevo. Le pedí a Connor que compre mi medicación en la farmacia mientras yo tomaba un baño. – Deberías quedarte en cama, hijo. - No puedo, tengo cosas que hacer. - Nada es más importante que tu salud, Josh. Deberías ir a un médico y no automedicarte. - No me estoy automedicando. Se prácticamente todos los tratamientos para toda clase de infecciones. Alex… aprendí de ella. – su nombre ya no dolía al pronunciarlo pero decirlo frente a otras personas resultaba raro, era como compartir un secreto que solo me pertenecía a mí. - Vaya. Que hables de ella es un avance. – suspiró – Josh, quiero que seas sincero. Sé lo que sucedió en la premier, sé que la volviste a ver y algo me hace pensar que tu cambio de actitud se debe a ella, ¿estoy en lo cierto? A veces pienso que mi madre tiene dotes de adivina. Siempre consigue sacarme la verdad y sabe cuándo estoy mintiendo. Hice un pequeño asentimiento con mi cabeza y mi madre tomó un gran suspiro antes de continuar: - No sé qué decirte, Josh. Pensé que al fin estabas avanzando pero estoy empezando a dudar que algún día lo logres y mucho menos si no pones de tu parte. ¿Regresaste con ella? - Ojalá fuera así, mamá. Solo la he visto y hoy es el día en que me encontraré con ella, por eso necesito estar bien mamá. No puedo perder esta oportunidad con ella. La quiero de regreso a mi lado. Ahora sé que sin ella no tengo vida. Mi madre me regala una mirada que roza la frustración y el entendimiento – Que sea lo que Dios quiera, Josh. Mi hermano regresó con el medicamento y con ayuda del baño me sentí muchísimo mejor. Me vestí rápidamente y tomé a un taxi para llegar justo a tiempo al refugio. La encargada me entregó un uniforme de color azul marino de mi talla y unas botas. Empecé mi labor de limpiar el patio donde permanecían los cachorros. Me tomó un buen rato movilizarlos al otro patio. Empecé a barrer y tomó demasiado tiempo ya que casi nunca había usado una escoba. Todo sea por el amor, me dije a mi mismo. Empezaba a desesperarme. Ya era hora de que Alex hubiera llegado. Terminé rápidamente de barrer y recoger todas las \"gracias\" de los pequeños. Usé la manguera y lavé todo para luego traer a los cachorros de regreso a su ahora limpio hogar. Casi era medio día y mi niña no había llegado. Como había terminado mi tarea me acerqué a Martha a ver si podía sacar algo de información. - Pensé que conocería a mi compañera. - Oh, es cierto – dijo mientras apuntaba algo en su agenda – Alexandra me pidió el día libre. Dijo que era el cumpleaños de su amiga y tenía que ayudarle a preparar todo. Por supuesto no me negué, ella ha hecho todo el trabajo sola por algún tiempo. Se merecía un descanso. Me sentía decepcionado por no poder verla. Todo esto no servía de nada. - Veo que ya terminaste. Alex vino ayer y dejo adelantando su trabajo así que no tienes nada más que hacer. Si quieres puedes irte temprano hoy. - Gracias. Luego de mudarme de ropa salí del refugio si una idea de que hacer. No podía esperar más, este sería el día en que estaría de regreso a su vida. - Hola – respondí cuando mi celular vibró. - ¿Josh? – era Avan – Hermanoo ¿ qué le sucedió a tu voz, estas irreconocible. - Amigdalitis – respondí serio. Su risa estridente no me causaba ninguna gracia en estos momentos. - Vamos, Josh. Suenas a Arnold Schwarzenegger en Terminator con esa voz profunda. Te juro que quiero escucharte decir: Hasta la vista, baby. - No estoy para bromas, Avan. - ¿No deberías estar feliz? Se suponía que para estas horas estaría con Alexandra. ¿Qué sucedió? Le conté lo de su día libre y como no tenía una maldita idea de que hacer. Avan era el único que sabía la verdad sobre lo que estaba haciendo con Alex. Además de Alyson… Oh mierda. Alyson. Era su cumpleaños. Ella me lo había dicho. Ella iba a hacer una fiesta, por supuesto. Alex estaría ahí. Sería el momento ideal. - Te llamo en un rato – dije y corté. Marqué el número de Alyson. - Hola – saludo suavemente. - Ally. Necesito ir a tu fiesta. ¿Alex estará allí, verdad? - Afirmativo – su tono era raro, entonces comprendí que posiblemente se encontraba con ella – dame un momento. La escuché hablar con alguien y luego de un momento volvió a mi llamada. – Listo. Alexa acaba de irse. Va a arreglarse para mi fiesta. ¿Así que quieres venir? Que conste que te invité. - Lo siento, Ally. Estaba muy distraído y ni se me paso la idea de que ella estaría ahí. Que estúpido que soy. - Eso ya lo sé. - Bueno quiero ir. Decidí que hoy será el día en que la enfrentaré. Necesito dos invitaciones. - Vaya. Ya era hora que te animaras. Dejaré en la entrada dos invitaciones a tu nombre. Recuerda que tienes que llevar disfraz. - Te debo mucho, Ally. Feliz Cumpleaños. Me despedí y marqué a Avan que contestó al segundo timbrazo. – Amigo, necesitamos ir de compras. Hoooola :) apenas acabo de escribir el cap 77 y actualicé... me costó mucho.. Hay 2 tipos de caps en los q me estanco: 1) los q sirven para rellenar entre sucesos 2) desisivos q cuestan q queden como uno quiere Bueno este erea el segundo tipo :P como ya les dije será el cap del reencuentro.. ahora si tengo q concentrarme un poco mas... espero q me tengan paciencia con el cap del miércoles... la verdad es q la universidad me consume y cuando llego a mi ksa estoy mas cansada q nunca..! espero q les haya gustado este cap... y ahora tienen mas idea de cmo será el reencuentro.. ¿q creen q sucederá? ¿cómo creen q será?

Lo siento si lo que te dije te incomodó pero creo que necesitabas ayuda. - No la necesitaba, puedo defenderme sola – lo dijo secamente y fue como si me hubiera abofeteado. Luego de un momento suspiro y su voz se suaviso – Lo lamento. Ha sido un mal día. Gracias por tu ayuda. - Míralo de este lado. Esos chicos creen que soy un suertudo por tener a una sexy chica como mi novia. Sonrío – Gracias por el cumplido.[Chapter 77] Capítulo 77 - Dime porque tengo que vestirme así. - Porque eres un buen amigo y me acompañarás a esa fiesta y te asegurarás que no me eche para atrás. - Más te vale que hayan chicas lindas. Necesito disfrutar la velada, también. - Alyson es muy linda. Puedo presentártela. - Olvídalo. Prefiero buscar mi propia presa yo mismo – dijo acomodándose su capa – solo quiero tener de donde escoger. - Es probable que por lo menos una chica te guste. Terminamos de vestirnos. Los únicos disfraces disponibles y no muy ridículos eran de príncipe para mí y de mosquetero para Avan. Antes de salir tome la medicación para evitar sentirme enfermo. - No olvides tu corona, príncipe – se burló Avan colocándola en mi cabeza – Insisto que siendo tú hubiera conseguido una chaqueta de cuero y gafas oscuras, combinadas con esa voz te juro que ninguna chica se resiste al efecto terminator. Le di un golpe en su espalda mientras nos dirigíamos al taxi que nos esperaba. Mientras nos llevaba al local empecé a sentirme impaciente. Mi corazón latía más rápido y un nudo en mi garganta empezaba a formarse. Cuando nos detuvimos frente al hotel y bajamos, por un momento sentí que el mundo cayó sobre mis hombros. Mi pecho apretó y tuve que tomar una gran bocanada de aire para poder seguir. Los guardias de la entrada nos dieron paso y nos entregaron unos antifaces. Eran aquellos que llegaban hasta tu mandíbula y subían nuevamente hasta el puente de tu nariz y volvía a bajar. De esa manera solo dejaba libre la boca. Prácticamente no podías reconocer a nadie si solo te fijabas en el rostro. - Creo que la chica invitó a todo Boston – aseguró Avan lo que probablemente era cierto. El lugar era realmente enorme. Tenía un escenario en el fondo donde tocaba un banda y tenía un segundo piso donde también bailaban parejas y aun así estaba completamente lleno. Debía al menos haber unas 600 personas disfrazadas. Podía ver la cabina del Dj junto al bar. Trate de buscar a Alex con la mirada en medio de toda la multitud pero no tuve suerte. Le hice una seña al emocionado Avan, que se deleitaba con ciertos disfraces y provocativos escotes, para dirigirnos a la parte superior. Subimos las escaleras en forma de caracol y nos acercamos a la barandilla para tratar de localizarla. - ¿La encontraste? – gritó sobre la música que provenía en este momento de la banda. Tenía una buena vista pero no lograba ubicar a mi niña. Negué con la cabeza. – Deberíamos bailar mientras la buscas. - Si quieres baila tu – apenas lo divisaba con las luces que parpadeaban. - No seas aburrido – me dijo y le dedique una de mis miradas de enojo. Lo vi bailar con algunas chicas. Debía admitir que la idea del disfraz nos facilitaba mezclarnos con la gente sin recibir más atención de la debida. Ya llevaba media hora buscándola y solo había localizado a Alyson en su disfraz de enfermera sexy, quien había subido al escenario a agradecer a los invitados por su presencia y a anunciar una nueva canción de la banda. Avan regresó a mi lado – Chico, tienes que bailar. La música esta fabulosa – dijo emocionado moviéndose al ritmo de la canción que sonaba. - No he venido a bailar. Necesito encontrarla. - Como tú digas, abúrrete, amargado. Yo acabo de ver a cierta princesa peliroja – señaló a una chica junto al escenario que conversaba con el solista de la banda – debiste verla bailar. Esos movimientos me conquistaron. Algo me dice que debajo de esa gran falda se encuentra un pervertido y precioso secreto. Observé a la pareja conversar animadamente. Por la actitud del chico, obviamente estaba coqueteando y no era discreto apreciando el favorecedor escote de ella. Vestí un traje colonial que se ajustaba a su busto de una manera sexy sin llegar a lo vulgar. Su cabello, que al parecer era rojo con apenas recogidos unas mechas para darle diseño, caía sutilmente por su cuello y hombros descubiertos. La falda que se extendía por debajo de su busto se veía pesada pero, como dijo Avan, te daba la intriga de descubrir que había oculto en su interior. Aparté mi mirada de ella. No había venido aquí para enredarme con una sexy chica. Vine aquí para recuperar a la otra mitad de mi alma. - Oh no. No me digas que va a cantar – volví la mirada y la vi subiendo al escenario. Alyson la alcanzó en una esquina y le ayudó a desprenderse de aquella falda revelando un traje realmente favorecedor y unas sexys piernas en mallas y tacones. Obviamente los chicos se volvieron locos y chiflaron, incluido Avan que parecía hipnotizado con ella. Avanzó y tomó un micrófono mientras el resto de la banda se ubicaba en sus respectivos lugares. Empezó a sonar la melodía. – Wooooa. No esa canción – gimió mi amigo. Fue cuando la chica se retiró su antifaz lanzándola a un lado y se acercó a cantar que supe que había encontrado lo que vine a buscar. (You don't know me – Elizabeth Gillies: www_youtube_com/watch?v=Vgw5pUxnPVk ) Me perdí en su canción y sus movimientos. No solo el hecho de que era una profesional en el escenario, si no estaba la pasión que ponía, la forma en que trasmitía su mensaje. You think you know me (Tú piensas que me conoces) But you don't know me (pero no me conoces) You think you own me (Tú piensas que eres mi dueño) But you can't control me (Pero no puedes controlarme.) You look at me and (tú me miras y) there's just one thing that you see (sólo hay una cosa que puedes ver.) So listen to me (Así que escúchame) Listen to me (¡Escúchame!) Sus movimientos complementaban su voz y el ritmo de la canción. You push me back (Tú me empujas de nuevo) I push you back (Yo te empujo de vuelta) Harder, harder (Más fuerte, más fuerte) You scream at me (Tú me gritas) I scream at you (Yo te gritaré) Louder, L-L-L-L-Louder (Más fuerte, M-M-M-M-Más fuerte) I'm dangerous so I'm warning you (Soy peligrosa así que te estoy advirtiendo) Cause you're not afraid of me (pero tú no me tienes miedo) And I can't convince you (y no puedo convencerte) You don't know me (No me conoces) Para la segunda estrofa usó al solista de la banda, que se encontraba a un lado del escenario, tomándolo de su corbata desaliñada, para el espectáculo atrayéndolo hacia ella como si todo el acto fuera dirigido hacia él. You think you got me (Piensas que me tienes) But you don't get me (pero no me has conseguido) You think you want me (Piensas que me quieres) But you don't know what you're getting into (Pero no sabes en lo que te estás metiendo) There's so much more to me (Hay mucho más de mí) then what you think you see (de lo que crees ver) So listen to me (así que escúchame) Just listen to me (¡sólo escúchame!) Pude ver la sorpresa y el deseo del chico al tenerla así de cerca. Estuve a punto de ir por él y golpearlo por querer a MI chica, cuando ella lo apartó de un empujón para cantar el coro otra vez. You push me back (Tú me empujas de nuevo) I push you back (Yo te empujo de vuelta) Harder, harder (Más fuerte, más fuerte) You scream at me (Tú me gritas) I scream at you (Yo te gritaré) Louder, L-L-L-L-Louder (Más fuerte, M-M-M-M-Más fuerte) I'm dangerous so I'm warning you (Soy peligrosa así que te estoy advirtiendo) Cause you're not afraid of me (pero tú no me tienes miedo) And I can't convince you (y no puedo convencerte) La veía cantar con mucho sentimiento, como si en verdad sintiera cada palabra que decía. Le dolía. Había dolor en su voz, pero también había algo que cambió en ella, algo que no había notado antes y no podía identificarlo. That you don't know me (de que no me conoces) And the longer that you stay, (y mientras más te quedas,) the ice is melting (el hielo se está derritiendo) And the pain feels okay, it feels okay (heyy) (y el dolor se siente bien, se siente bien) La vi cantar en el suelo aquella estrofa. Estaba sentada sobre sus pantorrillas mientras llegaba perfectamente a aquellas notas altas. Se puso de pie y movió sus caderas tan sensualmente que estoy seguro que más de la mitad de chicos presentes tenían una gran erección. You push me back (Tú me empujas de nuevo) I push you back (Yo te empujo de vuelta) You scream at me (Tú me gritas) I scream at you (Yo te gritaré) Louder X9 (Fuerte X9) Cuando volvió a cantar el coro empezó a caer espuma del techo y todos gritaban y saltaban mientras disfrutaban del espectáculo. You push me back (Tú me empujas de nuevo) I push you back (Yo te empujo de vuelta ) Harder, harder (Más fuerte, más fuerte) You scream at me (Tú me gritas ) I scream at you (Yo te gritaré ) Louder, L-L-L-L-Louder (Más fuerte, M-M-M-M-Más fuerte) I'm dangerous so I'm warning you (Soy peligrosa así que te estoy advirtiendo) But you're not afraid of me (pero tú no me tienes miedo) And I can't convince you (y no puedo convencerte) I don't have to (no tengo que hacerlo) I think you know me (pienso que no me conoces) Alyson le sorprendió con un abrazo cuando terminó de cantar. Los aplausos y ovaciones no se hicieron esperar. – Creo que estoy enamorado – dijo Avan – Lizzie morirá cuando le diga que alguien cantó su canción mucho mejor que ella. Escuchaba a mi amigo pero no podía retirar mi mirada de ella. No podía identificar lo que había cambiado. Empezó a sonar otra canción por los parlantes. La reconocí, era una de sus favoritas (Insonmia – Craig David: watch?v=ImlJaSpoqw4 ) . Se juntó con Alyson y empezaron a moverse al ritmo de la canción. Se acercaron al borde del escenario y varias manos deseosas de tocarlas las ayudaron a bajar de un salto. - Con tu permiso amigo, pero he de ir al encuentro del amor de mi vida. Eso me hizo reaccionar mal. Tomé a Avan de su ropa y lo empujé contra la pared al inicio de las escaleras. – No te atrevas ni siquiera a mirarla. - Vamos hermano, no te comportes así. ¿Qué te sucede? Si quieres a esa chica debes dejar que ella decida, yo no me opong…- y vi cuando el entendimiento llegó a su rostro – Asi que ella es Alex. Mmmhmmm. Tienes buen gusto hermano. - Mas te vale alejarte de ella – lo solté y volví a la barandilla para tratar de localizarla. La veía desplazarse con una copa en su mano y bailando. Se abría camino y por la dirección suponía que iba hacia la puerta que daba paso al jardín posterior. - Vamos amigo, no sabía que era ella. No te pongas de ese modo, sabes que no soy así – dijo poniéndose a mi lado. Volteé para enfrentarlo. Sentía como la vergüenza me azotaba por mi reacción exagerada. - Lo siento. Es que pensar en otra persona cerca de ella… no me detuve a pensar… la mitad de chicos aquí la están mirando como un bocadillo…. MIERDA – grité exasperado. - No te preocupes por mí. Más te vale que vayas por ella, como dijiste, no soy el único que quedó impresionado. – señaló hacia un lugar próximo a la puerta donde se la vi dirigirse. Ahí estaba ella y un maldito la estaba sosteniendo del brazo. Vi que trataba de zafarse sin lograrlo. La sangre volvió a hervir en mis venas. Bajé como alma que lleva al diablo. De alguna manera avancé muy rápido hacia donde ella estaba que era prácticamente el lado puesto de donde yo la miraba. La gente me dio paso, quizá fue la furia que emanaba, o quizá alguna fuerza superior me estaba facilitando las cosas para llegar a ella. El tipo la seguí sujetando, tratando de atraerla hacia él. Cuando llegué ahí lo agarré del brazo que sujetaba a mi chica lo que le hizo soltarla y girar para enfrentarme – Déjala en paz. Es MÍ novia. Gruñí. Lo examiné. Era un poco más alto que yo pero mucha más delgado. Estaba dispuesto a enfrentarme pero yo estaba confiado en ganarle muy fácilmente. Después de todo había entrenado la mayor parte de mí vida para estar en forma. Sé cómo noquear a alguien. - Pues tu noviecita es una calientapollas. – mi puño hizo contacto con su mandíbula. Su antifaz fue a dar a algún lado. No tuvo tiempo de reaccionar a mi golpe y terminó en el piso. Estuvo dispuesto a pararse y querer devolverme el golpe y yo definitivamente estaba dispuesto a molerlo a golpes luego de haber hablado de esa manera. Pero dos chicos, que supongo que eran sus amigos se interpusieron. No me importaba patearles el trasero a ellos también. Uno de ellos ayudó al tipejo a ponerse de pie con su labio sangrante. El otro me hizo frente. – Lo lamento. Está borracho. No sabe lo que dice. Todavía estaba lleno de furia. Quería golpearlo más, se merecía cada uno de mis golpes. Miré hacia Alex que me veía un poco perturbada y fue cuando toda esa ira se esfumó. – Llévatelo de aquí. Y recuérdale que nunca debe dirigirse a una mujer de esa manera. Espero que ese labio le refresque la memoria de que el nació de una mujer. Para cuando trate de alejarme solo vislumbre a Alex salir por aquella puerta hacia el jardín. Tomé una bocanada de aire y fui tras ella. No me había dado cuenta del calor que hacía adentro hasta que mi piel se estremeció con el contraste de temperatura. La busqué con la mirada y la encontré sentada al borde de la piscina. Me acerqué a ella lentamente. Tomé una bocanada de aire, algo que ayudaba con mi nerviosismo, y me senté junto a ella. Alex levantó la mirada y volvió a fijarse en el agua de la alberca ignorándome completamente. Vi cómo contenía su frustración y su rabia. En otras circunstancias ella hubiera dejado salir todo eso ya sea como gritos o lágrimas. Ahí comprendí en que había cambiado. Era dura. Ya no era la misma chica dulce que confiaba en todos, ahora su presencia mostraba fuerza y se imponía. Entendí que ya no se derrumbaba por cualquier altercado, todo lo contrario, nada la desarmaría. Y eso me dio miedo. De cierta manera estaba fuera de mi alcancé. Me sería muy difícil liberarme de toda esa protección que ella mismo se había impuesto. Permanecimos ahí por un buen momento. Ella no dio ningún reconocimiento de mi presencia. La escuché suspirar. Sus manos fueron a su cabeza y se retiró la peluca. No había cuestionado por qué traía el cabello de esa manera hasta que la vi dejarla a un lado y retirar los ganchos de su cabello liberándolos de esa prisión. Sus rizos fueron cayendo de poco a poco. No pude evitar que el anhelo de enredar mis dedos en ellos me llenara. Era lo que más quería en este momento. Cuando terminó, tomó una bocanada de aire y levanto la mirada hacia mí. – No sabía que tenía novio. Respuesta ingeniosa. – ¿No lo tienes? Mi pregunta era ingeniosa aunque sabía la respuesta. Pero lo siguiente que salió de su boca me tomó por sorpresa. – No hasta lo que yo recuerde. Nada de novios ni otros compromisos. No podía creer que Alyson no me lo hubiera dicho porque Alex no es de esas personas que escondan su relación con otro fin. – Vale. Lo siento si lo que te dije te incomodó pero creo que necesitabas ayuda. - No la necesitaba, puedo defenderme sola – lo dijo secamente y fue como si me hubiera abofeteado. Luego de un momento suspiro y su voz se suaviso – Lo lamento. Ha sido un mal día. Gracias por tu ayuda. - Míralo de este lado. Esos chicos creen que soy un suertudo por tener a una sexy chica como mi novia. Sonrío – Gracias por el cumplido. - Me gusta tu sonrisa. Debería siempre sonreír. – me perdí en su mirada. No podía creer que estaba tan cerca, pero sentía que no era lo suficiente. Ella aparto sus ojos de mí. – Vale. También he tenido un mal día. ¿Quieres contarme que sucedió? - Ni siquiera te conozco – respondió con un tono un poco más seco. - Te sentirás mejor si sueltas todo. Además soy un desconocido, no sé nada sobre ti, seré imparcial y quizás nunca me vuelvas a ver – como si fuera posible que la deje ir de nuevo – así que no te preocuparas que divulgue tu secreto. La vi dudar y luego me contó. Me dijo sobre su pelea con Darío. Trato de no darme muchas explicaciones pero entendía perfectamente su frustración, después de todo sabía lo que estaba sucediendo con ella. Parte de mí se sentía feliz de que ella este libre pero mi otra parte sabía que ella sufría por él y también sabía que había actuado impulsivamente y que solo son sus celos actuando. Darío nunca le haría eso, aunque me cueste admitirlo. - Creo que exageras – le dije cuando termino – no te enojes, es normal que sientas celos pero si él no te ha dado motivos para dudar ¿Por qué hacerlo ahora? - Es exactamente porque me siento mal en estos momentos. Sé que actué impulsivamente y no me detuve a pensar. Es que… tengo miedo de que me hagan sufrir… de nuevo. Lo último lo dijo como un susurro pero lo escuché y sé que se refería a mí. No sabía que sentir ni que decirle. - ¿Y qué hay de ti? – me preguntó. - ¿Qué quieres saber? – le pregunté. - Bueno, obviamente no quiero saber tu nombre porque dejarías de ser un desconocido y eso me pondría en una cuestión embarazosa ¿No tienes una chica que trate de golpearme por llevar el título de \"tu novia\"? No pude evitar reír. Con ella nunca podía aburrirte. – No. No corres peligro. - Y debo suponer que no tienes ninguna historia que te rompa el corazón. - En realidad sí. Hay una chica que me tiene loco. – suspiré – ella es… única. Pero tiene novio, y no quiere saber de mí. - Eso es triste – asentí. - ¿Has jugado alguna vez al juego de la estrella? – pregunté. Negó con la cabeza. – Es algo que leí en un libro y me parece que puede entretenernos en este momento para dejar de hablar de cosas tristes. - Así que lees ¿Qué libro era? - Te lo digo si juras no reírte. - No tengo porque reírme. No es nada malo que leas. - Era un libro de chicas. - Soy una chica. No lo encuentro lo malo. - Soy un chico y se supone que no debo leer ese tipo de libros. Se echó a reír y mi corazón se emocionada al escuchar cada sonido que emitía - ¿Qué libro era? - Shut out de Kody Keplinger. - Bueno, está en la cima de mi lista. - Para jugar tienes que elegir una forma. Cualquier cosa. Y yo tengo buscar en las estrellas como si fueran puntos. Comienza. - Mmmmm no tengo idea – dijo pensativa mirando al cielo estrellado. - Solo escoge una figura – le dije. - Bien. Un triángulo.- me respondió y sonreí. - ¿Qué sucede? – preguntó. - Diste la misma respuesta que la chica del libro. Además es demasiado fácil. – actué rápidamente y tomé su mano. Fue como si una descarga eléctrica nos atravesara. Estoy seguro de que ella también la sintió porque quiso retirar su mano aunque no se lo permití. Guíe su mano y apunté el cielo y especialmente a 3 estrellas formando el triángulo. Cuando terminé deje ir su mano lentamente. - ¿lo ves? - Interesante – dijo. Su voz se notaba una tanto nerviosa. – Ahora es mi turno. Debes formar… una jirafa. Se volteó rápidamente y en sus ojos pude ver desafío – No es justo. Eso es difícil. - De eso se trata el juego. Quien no pueda formar la imagen pierde. – ella miró al cielo y supé que encontraría la jirafa que le pedía. Ella nunca abandona un reto. Le mostré mi índice para que lo usara como señalador. Cuando tocó mi mano no pude evitar estremecerme nuevamente por la sensación de su contacto. Extrañaba mucho esto. Logró formar la jirafa, obviamente. - ¿Crees que podrás ganarme? – pregunté. - Que comience el juego – sonreí de nuevo cuando la semejanza de sus palabras con las de aquel libro. Jugamos, formando locas figuras y hablando de cosas triviales a la vez. - Acabo de ver una figura. ¿Crees que puedas adivinar qué es? - Por supuesto – respondió. Tomé su mano y dibujé muy despacio cada línea. Ella observaba detenidamente y se dejó guiar hasta que terminé. - Un corazón – susurro. No pude contenerme más. La tenía tan cerca y ella dejo de mirar el cielo y ahora me observaba detenidamente como si quisiera leer mi mente a través de mis ojos. Cerré mi mano sobre la suya y me incliné hacia ella. Tenía miedo de que me apartara pero no lo hizo. Era el momento ideal y la situación ideal. Nada podía contra eso. Cuando el primer roce de labios llegó una parte de mí volvió a la vida. Se sentía tan natural. Se sentía perfecto, único, justo como lo recordaba. Ahuequé su mejilla con mi mano y profundicé aquel beso. Era dulce, tierno pero lleno de sentimientos que no identificaban. Yo sabía que lo que trasmitía era amor, pero no tenía idea de lo que ella sentía ¿duda? ¿nerviosismo? ¿emoción? No estoy seguro. Pero lo que sí sé que esto no podía ser mejor. Sus ojos se habían cerrado mientras me inclinaba a ella pero parte de mí quería que me viera y me reconociera. Quería que sepa quién la estaba besando. Sus manos viajaron a mi cuello y acariciaron mi mandíbula. Ese contacto me hiso estremecerme. Envolví mis brazos en su cintura y tire de ella hacia mí más cerca aun. sentí el roce de mi nariz con la de ella, de nuestras mejillas y nuestros labios. Sentí sus cabellos bajos mis dedos de la misma manera que sus dedos exploraban mi cabeza. Nuestro beso terminó y abrimos los ojos. En ese momento pude ver un montón de emociones pasar por su rostro. En medio de todo lo que más resaltaba era la confusión. Desvíe mi mirada por un instante y vi mi antifaz en el suelo. - ¿Josh? Hoooola :) no los decepcioné... pude actualizar.. bueno les dire q acabo de terminar el siguiente cap.. es cortito pero no estoy muy segura de él. no me convence pero creo q lo dejaré de esa manera hasta mientras :) QUIERO OPINIOOOOOOOOOOOOONES :) Imaginaron el reencuentro de esta manera?

Esta conversación era absurda y no nos llevaba a ningún lado. - La verdad es que no sé porque estamos hablando de ello. No sirve de nada que toquemos ese tema. Ni siquiera tiene sentido que estemos el uno frente al otro.[Chapter 78] Capítulo 78 - ¿Josh? – mi mente estaba confundida y mi corazón había detenido su curso. No estaba segura de lo que veía. Parecía que alguien me estaba jugando una mala pasada. Cerré mis ojos y trataba de controla mi respiración. Tenía sentido. Ahora podía entender la familiaridad con este chico. Ahora comprendía porque sus labios sobre los míos se amoldaban de la forma más natural. - Alex – susurró. Tuve que mirarlo y enfrentarlo. Sus ojos me veían suplicantes haciendo que mi corazón se estrujara. Sentí como mis ojos se llenaban de lágrimas. Su mano se alzó y se acercó a mi mejilla. Su piel se sentía suave contra la mía. Tuve que apartarme porque su presencia me hacía sentir débil. Me puse de pie, tomé mi peluca y corrí de regreso a la fiesta. Lo escuché llamándome y venir detrás mío. Atravesé la multitud de alguna manera. Temía desmayarme en cualquier momento. No quería enfrentarlo. No soportaba su cercanía. Me dolía. Me hacía cuestionarme todo lo que sucedió. Me hacía recordar lo feliz que había sido a su lado y la duda de que fui injusta con lo que nos sucedió. Ningún maldito taxi aparecía. Empecé a correr sin dirección, lo más rápido posible pero él me alcanzó en algún momento. Me tomó del brazo y aunque trate de zafarme no lo logré. - Déjame – sollocé – me haces daño, Josh. No me refería a lo físico, me refería a la forma en que mi mente, mi alma y mi corazón se enfrentaban con ideas contradictorias. Esa presión me estaba comiendo viva. No había vuelto a llorar por nadie. Ni siquiera por mi novio. Prometí no dejarme derrumbar por cualquier cosa. Pero Josh no era cualquier cosa. Él era quien más me había causado dolor. La última persona por quien derramé lágrimas y la razón por la que ahora mis ojos querían hacerlo, nuevamente. Su agarre se aflojó pero no me dejo ir. Nuestros ojos se encontraron por un largo rato sin que ninguno supiera que decir. - Lo lamento – dijo. - ¿Qué cosa? – pregunté en un susurro. - Todo… no quise engañarte – me quede pesando. ¿no quiso engañarme? ¿Se refiere a que no quiso cachonearme con esa chica? ¿Admitiría que fue su culpa? – No quise ocultarte quien era. Solo te quería cerca… pensé que me reconocerías. Con que era eso – Lo siento por no poder reconocerte con una máscara que prácticamente cubría toda tu cara y ¿qué le pasó a tu voz? – definitivamente hubiera reconocido su voz en cualquier lado, pero estaba diferente de como la recordaba. - Amigdalitis – noté que me había soltado. Estaba a dos paso de mí, mirando directamente pero notaba su cuerpo tenso, como si estuviera alerta para corres por mí si tratara de escapar. Levanté mi mano hacia su cuello y presioné suavemente alrededor de su traquea buscando cadenas ganglionares. Las encontré, por lo menos no mentía. Sus ojos se habían cerrado bajo mi tacto, su respiración se notaba entrecortada. Aparté mi mano. - ¿Qué estas tomando para la infección? – quizás hablaba mi instinto médico o quizás solo quería desviar el tema de nosotros. - Amoxicilina e ibuprofeno. - Bien. En un par de día estarás como nuevo. - Lo sé. Aprendía de la mejor doctora – podía verlo estudiándome. Notaba su miedo por cada palabra que decía. Empecé a caminar a lo largo de la calle. Él camino a mi lado - ¿De qué se trata esto Josh? - ¿Esto? – escupió la palabra como si yo hubiera dicho algún insulto – Se trata de que no he podido olvidarte. De que cada día sin ti me resulta demasiado difícil que el otro. Se trata de que hice una promesa y pretendo cumplirla. Solté un bufido – Prometiste no hacerme daño. No lo cumpliste. - No me refiero a eso. Prometí luchar por ti. Recordé todas las veces que habíamos dicho aquellas palabras, aquellas promesas que se quedaron en el aire junto con los recuerdos. - Lo hiciste… creo que todos hacemos promesas que no siempre llegamos a cumplir. - Yo pretendo cumplir esa promesa – aseguró. Esta conversación era absurda y no nos llevaba a ningún lado. - La verdad es que no sé porque estamos hablando de ello. No sirve de nada que toquemos ese tema. Ni siquiera tiene sentido que estemos el uno frente al otro. - Puede que tú no encuentres sentido, pero yo he esperado esto demasiado tiempo – tuve que detenerme y mirarlo. - ¿No hablas en serio? Pude ver como mi pregunta lo irritaba aún más. Sus ojos mostraba la ira que lo rondaba. – Maldita sea. Nunca en mi vida he estado más convencido de algo – gritó – tu no entiendes lo que ha sido este tiempo para mí. 2 AÑOS, ALEX. 2 años en que me he estado sintiendo culpable sobre si hice lo correcto. 2 años en los que no he hecho nada más que pensar en ti y la manera de recuperarte. - Basta – grité – 2 años, Josh. Debiste superarlo. No sé qué mierda piensas que haces. No puedes buscarme y pretender que obvie las cosas que sucedieron y el tiempo que pasó. Lo nuestro terminó. Entiéndelo. Supéralo. No puedes venir e interferir en mi vida porque tienes un maldito capricho. No soy tu juguete, Joshua. Su rostro se tornó sombrío como si lo hubiera golpeado. – Lo nuestro terminó. No sé si fue o no tú culpa. Parte de mí te creía, pero no podía olvidarme de la parte que dudaba de ti. ¿Cómo quería que te creyera si me habías dado razones para desconfiar? Te amaba. Eras mi vida. Di todo lo que era para ser merecedora de tu amor pero resulta que tú eras quién no me merecía. No solo te acostaste con esa, me usaste para ser popular. ¿Cómo pretendías que confíe en ti luego de eso? – mi voz era más calmada, pero sentía que cada palabra rompía mi corazón en trocitos nuevamente – No puedes simplemente dejarme, y luego volver después de 2 años esperando que te haya perdonado y reciba con los brazos abiertos. - Yo no te dejé, Alexandra. Tú me obligaste a alejarme. - No importa como pasaron las cosas. Sucedió. Se acabó. - Te amo. Entiéndelo. Te amé desde el instante en que te conocí, te amé todo el tiempo que te tuve a mi lado, te amo ahora y te amaré hasta el día que me muera. ¿Cómo puedes esperar que me quede de brazos cruzados? ¿Cómo pretendes que me olvidé de lo único verdaderamente importante en mi vida? Y fue cuando mis lágrimas rodaron inconsolablemente. \"Te Amo\". Parecía tan convencido, tan seguro de sus sentimientos hacia mí. ¿Cómo podía seguirme amando? No entiendo. Si yo no hubiera tenido a Darío a mi lado para avanzar y lograr que lo quiera de esa manera estoy segura de que tampoco hubiera podido olvidar a Josh. Pero él tampoco estuvo solo, él fue el primero en buscar a alguien con quien \"superarme\". - No digas eso. - ¿Por qué no, Alex? – había logrado arrinconarme contra la pared de un edificio y su mano acariciaba mi mejilla. Mi corazón latía desbocado ante la sensación. – ¿Porque no puedes creer que nada hará que me olvide de ti? Te lo dije… eres lo más maravilloso que he tenido. No puedo perderte. No volveré a dejarte ir. Tuve que apartarlo porque mis pensamientos estaban enredándose. – Sorprendentemente decides eso luego de tanto tiempo. Justo luego de que nos encontráramos. Desde mi punto de vista lo que tienes es un capricho. Volvió a empujarme contra la pared y aprisionarme. – No tienes derecho a juzgarme. - No te estoy juzgando. Estoy diciendo lo que veo. Te conozco… - No me conoces – me interrumpió dando un golpe a la pared con su mano. Apoyó sus antebrazos en la pared a cada lado de mi cabeza aprisionándome completamente – Si me conocieras no hubieras dudado de mi amor por ti. Si me conocieras sabrías que nunca dejé de amarte… si me conocieras sabrías que voy a luchar por ti. Su mirada viajaba de mis ojos a mis labios. Quería que me besara. Mi cuerpo estaba anhelando su cercanía, su contacto. Sabía que estaba mal, sabía que no debería desear esto de esta manera. Debía apartar todos esos sentimientos y dejarlos en el pasado donde debían esconderse. De alguna manera, sacando fuerza de voluntad de algún lado logré apartarlo. – Ya no tiene caso, Josh. No voy a discutir lo que sientes pero necesitas superarlo. Solo debes decidirte como yo lo hice. - Claro que esta vez será mi decisión. No dejaré que vuelvas a elegir por mí, Alexandra. ¿y sabes que elijo? Elijo luchar. Elijo cumplir mi promesa aunque eso incluya ir en tu contra. - No sé qué esperas sacar de todo esto. Yo ya pasé la página y tengo una vida. Tú no estás en ella, ya no. Logré que un taxi se detuviera. Abrí la puerta y entré. Josh no me permitió cerrar la puerta. La sujetó. Pude verlo, emanaba seguridad. Algo me decía que no iba a desistir. - Te venceré, Alexandra. Lucharé por lo nuestro. – Por un momento bajo la mirada a mi cuello. Seguí su mirada a mi llamador de ángeles. Su rostro formó una sonrisa. – Ni siquiera tu ángel podrá salvarte de mí. Cerró la puerta y el taxi arrancó. Él entendimiento llegó a mi como una oleada que arrastró toda la paz que creí tener. ¿Cómo pude ser tan estúpida? Fernanda tenía razón. Fue él. Josh era quién me escribía. Ahora todo concordaba. La familiaridad, la historia, todas esas veces que me identifiqué con él, todas las veces que recordaba a Josh. Tenía razón. Él había empezado esta guerra sin que yo me hubiera dado cuenta. Ahora solo tendría que jugar y ganarle. Hooola :) Aquí tienen la primera charla.. como les dije no quedé totalmente satisfecha xq siento q estoy avanzando muy rápido pero decidí dejarlo como estaba :) como les dije lo q sucedera acontinuación sera en el transcurso de 6 meses debido a q necesio q coincidan en fechas :) ya me entenderán...

Me miro por un momento y negó con la cabeza riendo – Él estaba muy, muy preocupado por ti. ¿Cómo lo descubriste? - Digamos que fue bastante obvio una vez que se presentó frente a mí.[Chapter 79] Capítulo 79 Una bruma se acumulaba en mi cabeza además del constante palpitar. Dolía. - Alex – una voz llegó a mí y retumbo exacerbando mi dolor. - Alexandra – seguían llamando – Alex. Reacciona. Santiago trae más hielo. Mis párpados pesaban como si les hubieran atado ladrillos, no podía abrirlos. Las palabras y el ruido a mi alrededor provocaba más sufrimiento a mi cuerpo. Logré abrir mis ojos y mientras enfocaba a mí alrededor la luz me deslumbro provocándome un gemido. - Gracias a Dios – Fer estaba a mi lado. Vi a Santy entrar con una bolsa de hielo que Fer envolvió en una toalla antes de ponerla en mi frente. Pude sentir el choque de temperatura. Tenía fiebre. - ¿Cómo te sientes? – preguntó mi amigo. - Como la mierda – literalmente - ¿Qué me sucedió? - Lo más probable es que tengas una infección. - Eso ya lo sé – era una respuesta estúpida – quiero decir ¿desde cuándo estoy así? – pude ver por la ventana que afuera estaba oscuro. Lo último que recuerdo es haber llegado a mi departamento y meterme en la cama. Eso quería decir que habían pasado solo unas horas o lo más probable que había amanecido y anochecido nuevamente. - Nosotros llegamos al medio día. Te vimos dormir asi que te dejamos continuar y nos fuimos a descansar. Me levanté por agua y te escuche hablando. Cuando vine a verte noté que tenías fiebre y estaba delirando. No reaccionabas y empezamos a tratar de bajarte la fiebre con medios físicos** - me ayudó a sentarme acomodando almohadas. - Me siento fatal – no terminé la frase y empecé a toser. Me pasaron un pañuelo para cubrir mi boca. Mi amiga me dio tapotaje** cuando se dio cuenta que tenía expectoración. – Mierda. - Hora de comprobar el diagnóstico. Alcanzó mi estetoscopio y empezó a examinar mis campos pulmonares. Inspeccionó, palpó, percutió y auscultó**. - ¿Condensación? – pregunté cuando terminó. Ella asintió. - No sé cómo te contagiaste de neumococo pero tenemos 2 opciones. Empezamos con el tratamiento empírico ** o vamos al hospital para hacerte todo el procedimiento**. Traté de decidir qué hacer. No recuerdo haber estado en contacto con ningún paciente con neumonía por lo que definitivamente había contraído una NAC**. - Tratamiento empírico. No pienso moverme de esta cama – no era totalmente una irresponsabilidad iniciar un tratamiento sin confirma el diagnóstico. Los médicos de áreas rurales normalmente tenían que hacerlo al no tener acceso a pruebas de laboratorio y radiográficas. Solo se basaban en la clínica para iniciar un tratamiento. Solo en caso de complicaciones o de presentarse criterios de hospitalización se trasladaba a un centro de salud mayor para dar un tratamiento más dirigido. Pero en el caso del área urbana, siempre se hacían primero los exámenes complementarios antes de medicar. Pero no quería hacer algo grande de una infección que a la final iba a ser tratada en casa. Santiago volvió de la farmacia con mis antibióticos. Había amanecido y me sentía culpable por evitar que descansaran luego de su turno. – Me voy a preparar – dijo él. Le di un gracias por preocuparse. Antes de ir a clase vino a despedirse, dejando claro que cualquier cosas que sucediera conmigo le comuniquen inmediatamente. A Fer le dio un beso y se fue. Ella me miro inquisitivamente - ¿qué sucedió con Darío? - Está disfrutando de sus veladas con cierta rubia – recordé todo el coraje que sentí cuando los vi juntos. - Sabes que estas exagerando ¿verdad? Ni tu puedes creer que él te engañaría. Sabes lo mucho que te ama. Solo son celos. SI. Son celos y lo que más me duele es que tiene razón al igual que Josh. Incluso él aceptó que Darío no es capaz de traicionarme de esa manera. Pero la culpa que siento no es solamente por haber actuado impulsivamente y terminar nuestra relación. También esta ese beso. Puedo echar la culpa a estar herida por lo que imaginé que sucedió entre esos dos, hasta podría justificarme por haber bebido, pero la verdad estaba en que quise ese beso. La necesidad de que esos labios toquen los míos había sido grande que no pude apartarme cuando sucedió. Y lo que más me molesta es que esa atracción se debe a él. Solo la he sentido por Josh. Es como si mi cuerpo, mi alma y mi corazón se lanzaran por él sin que mi mente lo reconociera siquiera. No quiero ni cuestionarme el porqué de eso. - ¿Qué tiene que ver Josh en todo esto? – su pregunta me dejó helada. No tenía manera de enterarse lo que sucedió – Lo mismo pregunto ¿Por qué metes a Josh en esto? Mi tono salió más duro de lo que traté que sonara. – Cuando te escuché delirar solo decías su nombre. Era como si lo llamaras. Así que relacioné tu drástica soltería con él. No puedes culparme. Quería contarle todo. Necesitaba tanto, tanto desahogarme con alguien. Necesitaba que alguien me dijera que debo hacer. – Bueno, creo que tendrás que hablar con Darío, será mejor que esperes a que regrese. Ahora descansa chiquilla. Luego de que se fue me envolví en mis cobijas y traté de bloquear mi mente. No me sentía lo suficiente mente fuerte para enfrentar la realidad. Josh estaba de regreso en mi vida. No creo haber dormido lo suficiente porque cuando abrí mis ojos me sentía más fatigada aun y desconcertada. No estaba en mi habitación, estaba en un hospital. - ¿Cómo te sientes Alex? – una voz un poco familiar llamó mi atención. Era una doctora, su cara se me hacía conocida, aunque no lograba identificarla. Dejó a un lado mi historia clínica en la que estaba escribiendo y se acercó a mí. – Nos diste un buen susto. Yo era quien estaba asustada. No sabía que había sucedido no como llegué aquí. - ¿Qué paso? El rostro de la doctora era dulce e impartía confianza. – No recuerdas nada ¿verdad? – negué con la cabeza – Te pusiste mal. Tu cuadro empeoró. Tus amigos te encontraron con insuficiencia respiratoria y te trajeron. Llegaste cianótica**. - ¿Por una simple neumonía? – no podía creer que me había puesto de esta manera. Debí haberme contagiado de algún agente nosocomial**. - ¿Qué fue: Pseudomona, estafilococo, klebsiella**? - Ninguno – respondió – eso es lo interesante. - No creo que he podido ponerme tan mal por simple neumoco. Además no recuerdo que me hayan hecho un cultivo. - Llegaste soporosa** pero si pudimos hacer un cultivo de esputo. El resultado fue que tenías neumonía por estreptococo piógenes. De ahí la evolución tan rápida. Me quede meditando lo que me decía. No había contraído ninguna enfermedad por algún germen agresivo todo lo contrario, un germen muy común. Era muy conocido por provocar, amigdalitis, otitis media, sinusitis e infecciones leves especialmente respiratorias. Pero normalmente no era causa de neumonías debido a que la inmunidad del cuerpo no dejaba que se propagué más allá de la garganta. Pero cuando la inmunidad se veía muy comprometida era posible esta infección que podía llegar a ser muy grave sobre todo por su evolución rápida que generaba un cuadro clínico severo pudiendo a llegar rápidamente a sepsis**. - ¿Qué tan mal inmunológicamente estoy? – pregunté irritada. - Esperaba que preguntaras eso. La biometría** muestra niveles normales de leucocitos con un 60% de neutrófilos - me dijo seriamente. Debía sentirme aliviada debido a que mis niveles eran normales hasta que entendí lo que se refería. Tenía una infección, una grave. Mis defensas deberían estar elevadas. Mis leucocitos deberían estar por encima de los límites normales. Lo que quiere decir que mis células de defensa estaban bajas por lo que facilitó la infección y el hecho de que estén en niveles normales de gente sana es porque se elevaron debido a esta. - Vamos. No te preocupes. Ahora estás bien. Luego de que te recuperes tendremos que solucionar esto. Podría ser cualquier cosa desde un simple estrés el que está afectando tus células. Te suministramos filgastrim** por lo que has estado evolucionando favorablemente. Ahora solo tienes que recuperarte. -Asentí – Gracias. Ella volvió a tomar mi historia clínica para continuar escribiendo su reporte mientras mi mente empezó a divagar el porqué de mi enfermedad. No tarde mucho en darme cuenta quién haba sido la fuente de estreptococo. Josh. Maldito. Tenía amigdalitis y me beso. Yo sé que no se le cruzó por la mente contagiarme en algún momento. Tampoco puedo culparlo porque mi cuadro haya llegado a ser tan grave. Si mi sistema inmune hubiera estado normal a lo mucho hubiera tenido una amigdalitis también. Ok. No es su culpa. Solo quiero alguien con quien enojarme. Y ese bendito beso me está complicando la existencia. - ¿Doctora Julianne? – sabía que me parecía familiar. Solo pensar en Josh y recordé donde la había visto. - ¿Si? – preguntó. Era hora de comprobar algo, aunque estaba casi completamente segura de que era Josh mi anterior salvador. - Fue Josh ¿verdad? ¿Quién me trajo aquí la vez que me desmayé? Me miro por un momento y negó con la cabeza riendo – Él estaba muy, muy preocupado por ti. ¿Cómo lo descubriste? - Digamos que fue bastante obvio una vez que se presentó frente a mí. Volvió a mirarme divertida – Ese chico te quiere, Alex. No lo digo solo porque lo aprecio. Ese día vi la devoción, el amor y la verdadera preocupación de alguien que en verdad ama. Aunque sus métodos para reconquistarte sean un tanto locos. - Ni que lo diga. – volvió a sonreír y salió de la habitación. No tuve tiempo de meditar todo lo que había ocurrido cuando Fernanda y Santiago llegaron y me bombardearon con preguntas, discursos de preocupación. - Mi hermano está muy preocupado – dijo Santy. - Al igual que Peter – dijo rápidamente Fer. - Ustedes solo se dedicaron a decirle a todo mundo que estaba enferma. - No a todo mundo. Solo a ellos dos aunque si no mejorabas íbamos a llamar a tu mamá. - Gracias al cielo que no lo hicieron – probablemente mi mamá hubiera tomado el primer avión. - Ahora tienes que recuperarte, descansar, dejar el estrés, descansar…. - Ok. Ya entendí.- dije irritada. Ellos empezarían a tratarme como si estuviera inválida. - Algo me dice que decirte no es suficiente. No te dejaré salir de tu habitación toda la semana. Por cierto ya avisé de tu enfermedad en la universidad y en las clínicas. Definitivamente me volverían loca. Se fueron cuando la hora de visitas terminó. Por la ventana de mi habitación veía avanzar la noche. No podía dormir a pesar de que mi cuerpo se sentía cansado. El reloj de la pared indicaba que eran las 10 de la noche cuando mi puerta se abrió. Divisé un gran ramo de lirios y rosas de diferentes colores. Alguien lo traía pero no pude verlo porque el ramo lo cubría. Con su pie cerro la prueba tras sí. Caminó hacia la mesa junto a la ventana que estaba vacía y dejo el ramo. Debía imaginarme quien era. Josh. - Me tenías preocupado. Al mismo tiempo dije - ¿Qué haces aquí? Sonrío. Y fue de esas sonrisas coquetas por las que sus fans se volvían locas – Ya veo que estás bien. Parece que tienes la energía suficiente para golpearme. - Eso es precisamente lo que haré si no te largas. Él ignoró completamente mi amenaza y tomó una silla colocándola junto a mi cama y sentándose. – Nos diste a todo un buen susto. Moría por venir a verte pero sabía que tus amigos estarían aquí. - ¿Cómo mierda te dejaron pasar? Las visitas terminaron hace horas. - Contactos – dijo presumidamente. No pude evitar rodar los ojos. Como aún seguía recostada me giré dándole mi espalda. Una clara invitación de que quería que se marchara. – Alex. No sabía que tenías esos modales. Ni siquiera me has dado las gracias por las flores. - No las quiero. No tienes derecho de reclamarme nada. No se cómo pero él se subió en la cama y se acomodó sobre mí. Estaba peligrosamente cerca. Sus piernas a cada lado de la mías y sus brazos a cada lado de mi cara. Tuve que tomar un gran suspiro para intentar que mi corazón se tranquilizara. - Apártate – dije. - ¿Por qué? – dijo con una sonrisa arrogante. Esta invasión de mi espacio personal no me deja pensar – Porque puedo contagiarte. – estúpida excusa. Pero mi mente no pudo recordar las otras razones por las que debería aparatarse. - No me importaría contagiarme si eso significa estar cerca. - Así como no te importó contagiarme – eso sí que lo hizo apartarse. Así de rápido como había estado sobre mí se había retirado. Su mirada ahora era tormentosa. - ¿Eso es verdad? – asentí – Lo siento tanto. Pude ver el remordimiento en sus ojos y no pude dejar de sentirme mal. – Bueno, mi sistema inmunológico tampoco ayudó mucho. Y ahí estaba otra vez esa sonrisa – Es mi idea o tratabas de consolarme? - Solo decía la verdad. Ahora por favor vete. Creí que habías entendido mi punto. No te quiero en MI vida. - Y yo pensé que entendiste que esta vez tú no tenías la última palabra. – no me había dado cuenta que su mano había estado a mi lado hasta que sentí su caricia en mi mejilla. Mi suspiro de frustración al parecer lo divirtió. – No sé qué hacer contigo, Joshua. No sé qué pretendes con todo, mejor dicho, se lo que pretendes pero no entiendo porque no aceptas que nada de lo que planeas pasará. - Ya lo veremos – dijo muy cerca de mi rostro. No pude evitar perderme en sus labios. Maldita sea, no debería querer que me bese. Cerré mis ojos. – Estoy cansada, Joshua. No pienso gastar mis pocas energías en ti. Sus labios estaban sobre mi frente. Solo ese pequeño contacto hizo que mi corazón lata desbocado y todos mis sentidos se despertaran queriendo más de él. - Lastimosamente para mí, no me veras en una larga temporada. Tendré que trabajar y tú tendrás tiempo para pensar en nosotros. Eso no quiere decir que desapareceré del mapa. Estaré en contacto. Sus labios cayeron sobre los míos con la misma rapidez con la que los dejaron. No tuve tiempo de reaccionar. Antes de cerrar la puerta me miró. – Te veo pronto, cariño. Y se fue dejándome con el corazón desbocado y mi mente en conflicto. Tendría que prepararme para la guerra. Hoooola :) ya volví.. se que quieren matarme pero no o hagan :P Mi vida estos días ha sido muy caótica y el tiempo y la inspiraicón no han llegado...! pero bueno ahora voy a ponerme al día...! aun estoy esperando los reviews del anterior cap.. espere muchos comentarios para saber q opinaban y no obtuve ninguno :( TÉRMINOS MÉDICOS Medios físicos: cuando se trata de reducir la fiebre por medios como agua fría, duchas. es decir, sin medicamentos. Tapotaje: palmaditas en la espalda por todo el campo pulmonar que ayuda a expulsar las secreciones Inspección, palpación, percusión y auscultación: técnicas de semiología para diagnosticar enfermedades. en este caso en la inspeccion de toraz podíamos encontrar tiraje intercostal, palpación la expansibilidad y elasticidad del torax disminuida, percusión encontramos matidez (aire reemplazado por líquido por lo que da un sonido sordo) y auscultación principalmente estretores (sonidos patologicos) y murmullo vesicular (ruido normal paso aire a los pulmones) disminuido. etos son signos clásicos que dan sospecha a neumonias. Tratamiento empírico: para dar antibioticos uno se debe asegurar que tipo de agente es el causante pero el procedimiento es demorado y caro. el tto empirico es la adminitracion de antibioticos sin que sepa con seguridad el agente pero se apunta a los agentes mas comunes como en caso de la neumonía el streptococo pneumoniae (neumococo) o varios medicamentos q cubran todos los agentes posibles. este tipo de tratamiento se da a nivel de comunidades y muchos consultorios q no tienen acceso a hospitales con mejores tecnicas de diagnostico. Procedimiento hospitalario: en este caso de nuemonia. cuando llega un paciente y presenta estos síntomas se lo evalua y dependiendo del estado se inicia un tratamiento empirico o procede a realizar estudios si hay gravedad como radiografia de torax para ver el daño pulmonar, examen de sangre para ver la elevacion de células comunes en infecciones y cultivos de esputo para determinar el agente. NAC: Neumonía adquirida en la comunidad. es decir q no son adquiridas dentro de un hopital. el germen mas comun es el neumococo. Cianótica: labios, piel, mucosas moradas. Nosocomial: infecciones adquiridas en centros médicos por lo general los germenes son menos comunes o mas agresivos y resistentes a los tratamientos. Pseudomona, estafilococo, klebsiella: agentes que causan neumonías mas graves. tambien nosocomiales. Soporosa: es un estado entre alerta y somnolienta. Sepsis: es la respuesta del organimos ante una infeccion grave. es uan estadío que complica la vida del paciente. las bacterias llegan a la sangre (septicemia) y pueden viajar a otros organos causando daños. Biometría: examen de sangre donde principalmente se ven valores de celulas sanguineas. Filgastrim: nombre comercial del un medicamento \" factor estimulante de colonias\" que hace que estimula a las células sanguineas de defensa (leucocitos: linfocitos, neutrófilos, basófilos, etc) a q se reproduzcan y maduren. espero no haberles confundido mucho pero no puedo evitar el uso de terminos. espero haber explicado bien la enfermedad de Alex xq creanme q es importante. mas adelante entenderán. En un mensaje me preguntaron q libro es el q Alex lee en el cap 73. el de su cumpleaños.. había olvidado por completo nombrarlo.. es uno de mis libros favoritos. se llama BLINK ONCE de Cylin Busby.. se los recomiento totalmente. AHora si gracias x seguir leyendo a pesar de q estos capítulos no estan tan emocionantes y espero sus reviews.. creanme q es desesperante no saber si estan leyendo o no... si veo q hay reviews y opiniones talvez actualice el viernes... animenme :P ando un poco deprimida :P Nos leemos luego :) -.-.-.-.-.-.-.Z3 MILET AVANCE: - Michelle habló conmigo. No es buen momento para que regreses con ella, por lo menos no lo hagas público. Muchos creen que aún estás con Claudia. No se vería bien. - No voy a permitir que opines nuevamente acerca de mi vida personal. Tú fuiste en parte culpable de que la perdiera, y para tu información ella aún no me acepta de regreso.[Chapter 80] Capítulo 80 - Estás imposible, Josh. Te necesito concentrado. - Vale. No me regañes. Cualquiera puede olvidar ciertas cosas. - Si olvidaras una cita de un día es razonable – gimió Steven – Pero tu olvidaste una cita de 4 meses, Josh. Estás completamente distraído. - Mi mente ha estado en cosas más importantes. Y si dejaras de regañarme podría ocuparme en dejar todo listo. - Tu vuelo sale mañana a las 9am. ¿Podrías decirme en que andas metido? - Digamos que me volvieron el sentido a mi vida. Steven rodó los ojos. – Déjame adivinar. Alexandra. Mierda. Creo que soy demasiado obvio o él es un adivino. - ¿Cómo lo sabes? - Michelle habló conmigo. No es buen momento para que regreses con ella, por lo menos no lo hagas público. Muchos creen que aún estás con Claudia. No se vería bien. - No voy a permitir que opines nuevamente acerca de mi vida personal. Tú fuiste en parte culpable de que la perdiera, y para tu información ella aún no me acepta de regreso. - Sinceramente espero que regreses con Claudia. Esa chica te está haciendo perder la noción de lo que en verdad importa – dijo caminando hacia la puerta. - Lo que en verdad me importa es ella. Nos vemos en Paris. – dije cerrando la puerta de mi apartamento. No entendía como pude olvidar mi viaje. Este nuevo proyecto lo había aceptado hace meses. Maldita sea mi suerte. 4 meses ¿Cómo se supone que estaré 4 meses lejos de ella? Según mi contrato estaré de regreso para navidad. Hice una llamadas para dejar todo arreglado en mi ausencia. Lo típico de cada viaje. Desde quien cuidará mi departamento hasta quien llevará mis maletas mañana al aeropuerto. - Ally ¿cómo estás? – contesté mi celular. - Josh. Tengo que contarte algo… - ¿Es sobre Alex? ¿Te dijo algo de nosotros? - Es sobre Alex, pero… ¿se encontraron? – es cierto. No tuve la oportunidad de contarle a Alyson sobre lo que sucedió en su fiesta. - Si – dije entusiasmado – y la besé y hablamos y aunque no fue como hubiera querido le dije que esta vez no la dejaré ir… - Esta hospitalizada. - ¿Qué? – grité - ¿Qué sucedió? - Tranquilo, Josh. Está bien. Neumonía. La internaron pero está bien. - ¿Estás segura? – no entendía como ella podía estar tan tranquila y yo sentía que mi mundo estaba sacudiéndose. - Sí. No dramatices. No te niego que se puso mal pero ahora está estable. - ¿Dónde está? – me dio la dirección del hospital que fue el mismo al cual yo le había llevado la vez que se desmayó. Agradecí su información y llamé a mi tía Jules. Ella me confirmó su estado. Me explicó que era una infección un poco extraña y se debía a que estaba con las defensas de su organismo bajas. Eso en verdad me preocupo. Tenía un mal presentimiento sobre ella teniendo problemas de salud a cada momento. Partí al hospital, necesitaba verla, pero antes pare para comprarle un ramo de flores. - Josh – tía Jules me vio llegar y cuando vio las flores sacudió la cabeza en manera de negación. – Mejor me ahorro comentarios. Me costó mucho conseguir que te dejaran pasar fuera del horario de visitas. Espero que arregles las cosas con ella. - Eso pretendo tía. No sabes cuánto la amo. - Es una buena chica. Pero no estoy segura de que sea fácil convencerla. Ahora ve por ella que solo tienes una hora para verle. Le di un abrazo de agradecimiento y partí a su habitación. No puedo negar que sentí miedo cuando giré la perilla de aquella puerta pero entré rápidamente. Busqué donde dejar las flores antes de mirarla. La encontré con una expresión de duda mientras me miraba. Estaba pálida, delgada, con ojeras. Hermosa. Ella siempre se veía hermosa para mis ojos. - Me tenías preocupado. Le dije y ella al mismo tiempo me preguntó - ¿Qué haces aquí? Sonreí. Ella siempre tenía que darme pelea. Nada de lo que hiciera va a resultarme fácil. – Ya veo que estás bien. Parece que tienes la energía suficiente para golpearme. - Eso es precisamente lo que haré si no te largas. – algo en esa actitud estaba provocándome y no estoy hablando precisamente de rabia. La ignoré y me senté en su frente – Nos diste a todo un buen susto. Moría por venir a verte pero sabía que tus amigos estarían aquí. Tía Jules me informó de todo el movimiento en su habitación. Sabía que Darío no había venido. Seguramente está en sus pasantías. Que estúpido. - ¿Cómo mierda te dejaron pasar? Las visitas terminaron hace horas. - Contactos – verle rodar los ojos hacia que quisiera tomarla en mis brazos y torturarla con besos, como antes. Me encantaba su actitud de niña como ahora cuando se recostó dándome la espalda. – Alex. No sabía que tenías esos modales. Ni siquiera me has dado las gracias por las flores. - No las quiero. No tienes derecho de reclamarme nada. – las únicas respuestas que obtenía de ella era cuando estaba molesta. Tendría que jugar esa carta. Trepé sobre ella quedándome muy cerca de su rostro. La sorprendí. - Apártate – exigió. - ¿Por qué? – tenía su boca muy cerca de la mía, no desaprovecharía el momento. – Porque puedo contagiarte. - No me importaría contagiarme si eso significa estar cerca. – nada me importaba si podía estar a su lado. - Así como no te importó contagiarme –sus palabras me llegaron como un balde de agua fría. Me tomó un momento entender bien lo que quería decir y tenía razón. Yo estuve enfermo cuando la besé, era posible haberla contagiado. - ¿Eso es verdad? – no quería pensar en que era el culpable de que estuviera de esta manera– Lo siento tanto. Dudó por un momento. Su voz se tornó dulce y juguetona – Bueno, mi sistema inmunológico tampoco ayudó mucho. No pude evitar sonreír. Era la primera respuesta que obtenía de ella que no sea grosera. – Es mi idea o tratabas de consolarme? - Solo decía la verdad. Ahora por favor vete. Creí que habías entendido mi punto. No te quiero en MI vida. – las palabras dolían a pesar de que sabía que llegarían. - Y yo pensé que entendiste que esta vez tú no tenías la última palabra. – yo también tenía mucho que decir. Estaba frustrada y enojada. – No sé qué hacer contigo, Joshua. No sé qué pretendes con todo, mejor dicho, se lo que pretendes pero no entiendo porque no aceptas que nada de lo que planeas pasará. - Ya lo veremos – no pude evitar acercarme a esos labios, eran mi tentación. Mi cercanía le afectaba de alguna manera. Ella cerró sus ojos. – Estoy cansada, Joshua. No pienso gastar mis pocas energías en ti. Dejaría la pelea por hoy. Besé su frente y la sentí estremecerse. Punto para Josh! - Lastimosamente para mí, no me veras en una larga temporada. Tendré que trabajar y tú tendrás tiempo para pensar en nosotros. Eso no quiere decir que desapareceré del mapa. Estaré en contacto. Antes de irme tenía que buscar un pequeño incentivo que me fue regalado por ese rápido beso. – Te veo pronto, cariño. Dolía dejarla pero por ahora sería lo mejor. El viaje estuvo realmente largo o quizás solo fue la añoranza que sentía por alejarme una vez más de ella. Había salido del hospital. Alyson me mantenía al día en todo lo que se refería a ella. Había pasado una semana desde que me fui. Demasiada tregua. Ahora empezaba mu guerra contra ella. Primer paso: que sepa lo mal que la he pasado sin ella y cuanto aun la amo. Segundo paso: reconquistarla. Tercer paso: nunca dejarla ir. Encontré la canción perfecta y se la envié. Preparado para su respuesta. Quizás sean insultos, o volverá a decir que desaparezca. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O De tardes negras que no hay tiempo ni espacio y nadie nunca entenderà quedarte puedes porque la vida duele duele demasiado aqui sin ti y lucho contra el silencio hablando con el y he limado tu ausencia solo junto a mis brazos y si me quieres tú ya no me veras si menos me quieres yo mas estaré allí y si me quieres tú ya no me veras si menos me quieres yo mas estarè alli yo mas estarè alli, alli, alli Lo jurooo No tuve vida sin ti, pero ahora no perderé la oportunidad. Siempre estaré allí. (Tardes Negras – Tiziano Ferro: www_youtube_com/watch?v=zuVTDid8kUs ) \"Basta Joshua\" Habían pasado horas para decidirme a contestarle. Al inicio pensé que si respondía le daría importancia pero luego me di cuenta de que tendría que enfrentarlo en algún momento. Es mejor que sepa que estoy dentro de esta guerra. Tal vez tenga suerte y cuando él note que no podrá ganarme porque voy a enfrentarlo y nunca me doy por vencida se canse´. Bah. No tengo tanta suerte. \"Dame una razón\" Definitivamente no entendía a este tipo. Ya le había dicho que no lo quiero en mi vida ¿Qué otra razón necesita? \"No te soporto\" No era todo verdad. Lo que no soportaba era mi reacción cuando estaba cerca. \"Eso no decían tus labios\" ¿Cómo se atrevía…? Mi ira de alguna manera se desató y me encontré esperando que contestara. - Te amo – dijo cuándo contestó dejándome sin habla - ¿Alex? ¿Estás ahí? Me tomó un instante recuperarme - ¿Cómo te atreves a decirme eso? - ¿Qué te amo? Eso lo sabes, no entiendo porque te sorprende. No es algo que haya ocultado alguna vez – podía escucharlo reír. - Como tú digas. Me refiero a lo de mis labios. Sabes muy bien que no te besé. - Si mal no recuerdo tu lengua llegó a mi garganta y tus manos se enredaron en mi cabello haciendo perder mi máscara. También recuerdo ciertos gemidos por tu parte, la forma en la que te acercaste a mí y como tomé tu rostro entre mis manos…. - Basta – interrumpí. La forma en que lo decía me hacía revivir aquel momento y mi corazón empezaba a descontrolarse. – Tú me engañaste. Si hubiera sabido que eras tú jamás te hubiera dejado acercarte. - ¿Así que prefieres besarte con cualquier extraño? Me hieres, cariño. Pensé que era especial. - Esta conversación se está tornando totalmente ridícula. Lo diré una vez más, Joshua. Olvídate. De. Mí. - ¿Crees que no lo intenté? – Ahora había furia en su voz - ¿Crees que no traté de olvidarte? ¿Crees que me quede de brazos cruzados mientras tú me sacabas de tu vida? Pues no, Alexandra. No me enorgullece que mi maldito mundo gire a tú alrededor pero no pienso dar un pie atrás. - ¿No entiendes que yo ya pase de ti? – lo había hecho. Últimamente estaba dudando eso. - No, es verdad. Yo sé lo mucho que me amabas, al igual que yo. si yo no pude olvidarlo ¿por qué tu podrías? Aquí lo que sucede que te gusta mentirte a ti mismo solo porque estas herida y no quieres reconocer que lo que en verdad pasó es que encontraste la primera oportunidad para escapar de nuestra relación. - Tienes razón. Yo te amaba, Joshua. Eras mi vida ¿por qué diablos iba a querer escapar? – su razonamiento era ilógico. - Por tus malditas inseguridades. No podías creer que lo que teníamos era real. Siempre buscaste los \"peros\" a todo. Pero esta vez no dejaré que decidas porque estás llena de miedo. Temes que me acerque y te demuestre que estoy en lo cierto y que aún me amas. Te conformas pensando lo peor de mí para no enfrentar la verdad. No sé porque sus palabras me cayeron como un balde de agua helada. No era verdad. Yo no usé su traición como una forma de escape. Yo lo amaba. Estaba segura ¿verdad? - Aléjate, Joshua. - No puedes refutar mis palabras ¿verdad? – la ira e sus palabras me golpearon aún más – Deja de decirme Joshua. No me gusta. - Me importa una mierda lo que te guste. Corté la llamada furiosa. Furiosa con él por echarme la culpa de lo que paso. Furiosa con él por hacerme dudar. Maldito seas Josh Hutcherson. Me envolví en mis cobijas y trate de dormir. Esa absurda conversación solo me provocaba dolores de cabeza. Me sumergí en un mundo de sueños, mejor dicho recuerdos. Recordé el primer beso, la primera canción. El primer \"Te amo\" y nuestra primera vez. ¿Por qué todo tenía que ser tan complicado? La bruma del sueño se estaba despejando cuando sentí un brazo a mí alrededor. No podía evitar sonreír. Recordé la primera vez que había dormido con Josh. La manera en que se había aferrado a mi cuerpo para conciliar el sueño, como si yo fuera su única preocupación y el tenerme a su lado le traía la paz que necesitaba. A pesar de que me había enfadado mucho con él aquella vez por haber permitido que esa rubia oxigenada lo besara, fue un momento especial. Solo recordarlo hacía que mi pecho se llenara de calidez. Cuando me moví ese brazo se apretó más alrededor de mi cintura. Giré para encontrarme con Josh y me encontré con la maldita realidad. No era él. Me empujé lejos de su abrazo. Darío se despertó inmediatamente poniéndose de pie evitando caer al suelo. Le tomó un momento darse cuenta de lo que sucedía. Lo había apartado porque no era Josh, no porque estaba enfadada con él. Reconocer eso fue como una bofeteada. - Lo siento – dijo mirándome fijamente. – No quise despertarte cuando llegué. Mi mirada era cautelosa. Recordé porque estaba enfada con él pero también recordé que él nunca me traicionaría. Solo eran mis estúpidos celos. Me había dejado llevar por ellos y había terminado nuestra relación. Y luego… Y luego besé a Josh. Ahora la culpa empezaba a llenarme. Darío no me había engañado pero yo si lo había hecho. No me había detenido a pensar en él desde aquel beso. Me había hundido en mis pensamientos referentes a Josh que no me había dado cuenta hasta ahora que había traicionado a mi novio. - ¿Aún estás enfadada? – preguntó temeroso sacándome de mis pensamientos. No podía contestar. No podía ser tan hipócrita. Lo había dejado por acusarlo de engañarme y yo SÍ lo había traicionado. Avanzo hacia mí. Apenas sentí la cama hundirse bajo su peso cuando tomó mi rostro en sus manos. – Te juro que nada paso. Yo nunca podría mirar a otra persona que no seas tú. Alex, te amo y he sido un completo estúpido. Nunca debí dejarte tanto tiempo. Te prometo ya no dejarte. Si me aceptas de regreso las cosas van a cambiar. Soy un tonto por obsesionarme con las pasantías. No me di cuenta que te estaba dando motivos para desconfiar hasta que te perdí. ¿Podía sentirme más culpable aún? Él estaba asumiendo toda la culpa de lo que pasó. Ni siquiera sabía lo ruin que había sido. - Cuando Fernanda me dijo que estabas hospitalizada pensé que iba a morir. No encontré ningún maldito vuelo hasta anoche. Lo lamento tanto. Me necesitabas cerca y yo estaba a cientos de kilómetros. Debí estar a tu lado, cuidarte, mimarte. Mi voz seguía sin llegar así que hice algo más ruin aún. Me acerqué y lo bese. Pude sentir como soltaba el aliento que estaba reteniendo mientras me acercaba más a él con sus brazos. - ¿Entonces estamos bien? ¿Vuelves a ser mi novia? Solo asentí. No podía dejar de sentirme culpable y más aún cuando me estrecho más para volver a besarme. Era una mala persona. No lo merecía. Lo mínimo que debía hacer era decirle lo que había sucedido y esperar que me perdone. Y sabía que lo heriría. Aunque… habíamos terminado. Teóricamente no lo he traicionado. No me quiero justificar, sé que lo que hice estuvo mal, pero no quiero perderlo. Además no puedo dar un paso atrás. Josh no puede interferir en mi vida. Yo amaba a mi novio y no podía perderlo ahora ni nunca. - ¿Qué paso con tu \"amiga\"? – pregunté. - Te juro que entre Sidney y yo no hay nada. Ella es tímida. Digamos que era su único amigo. - ¿Eras? - Sí. Era. Si tu no quieres que me acerqué a ella no lo haré. No me importa. No hare nada que te haga daño. ¿Podía hacerme sentir peor? – No tienes que hacer eso. Confío en ti. Si dices que nada paso, te creo. No tienes por qué dejar de ser su amigo. Besó mi frente – ¿Cómo te sientes? – dijo después de un momento. Estábamos recostados. Mi cabeza estaba en su pecho y su brazo acariciaba mi espalda. - Mucho mejor. Aunque estoy harta de tener que descansar. - No digo que me alegre que estés enferma, pero estoy feliz de que estés descansando. Sabía que esto iba a pasar algún momento. Estas bajo demasiado estrés. Prométeme que tomaras con calma. - Tranquilo. Lo haré. No quiero volver a pasar por esto. – besó mi frente antes de caer dormido. Se aferró a mí y yo correspondí a ese abrazo. Me dormí sintiéndome como la peor persona de este mundo. Hooola :) Traté de subir el cap ayer pero no me lo permitió así que lo hice hoy... el próximo lo subire a mas tardar el lunes :) La canción de este cap me encanta. me pareció perfecto ponerla..! No tengo mucho q decir xq tengo q ir a estudiar, asi que en verdad espero sus reviews. Esa es mi gratificación. no saben lo emocionada q me siento en leerlos...! Xfa sigan dejando sus predicciones.. ¿que crean q sucederá? Sin mas preambulos... nos leemos luego :) -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET AVANCE: Me congelé por un momento al escuchar sus palabras. Antes tenía mucho miedo de pensar en un futuro porque no creía que en verdad tenía uno. Había tenido tanto miedo de que mi enfermedad regrese y que todos mis planes se esfumen. Solo Josh había hecho que piense en una vida con él, un futuro juntos y una vida plena. Pero todo había quedado en palabras y escuchar ahora a Darío no me causaba emoción precisamente.[Chapter 81] Capítulo 81 *DÍAS, SEMANAS, MESES DESPUES* Quiero volver a empezar, Alex. Te necesito tanto. Siempre lo he hecho. (The Scientist – Coldplay: www_youtube_com/watch?v=0iZmr39BB-c ) O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Siento haberte lastimado, es algo con lo que tendré que vivir todos los días. Y por todo el dolor que te hice pasar, desearía poder quitártelo. Y ser el que te seca todas las lágrimas. Tú eres la única razón por la que estoy vivo. No me pidas que no lo intente. (The Reason – Hoobastank: www_youtube_com/watch?v=KzoQUjIVd40 ) O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Solo llamé para decir \"Te amo\". Para decirte lo mucho que me importas.

(I Can't Help But Love You - Tyler Brown Williams: www_youtube_com/watch?v=WxweR8TudZY ) Solo quiero una oportunidad de recuperarte. Lo que nos sucedió no fue justo, necesito que lo seas conmigo. Lo que no es justo es q aún me busques. No es justo que me hagas sentir culpable. No es justo, Joshua. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - Hola Josh. - Ally. Es un gusto hablar contigo. - Waoooo ¿a qué se debe tanto entusiasmo? – preguntó divertida. - Debe ser el espíritu navideño. - La navidad hace feliz a todos. ¿Cómo está todo en Paris? - No estoy ahí. Estoy de camino a Kentucky, estoy esperando mi avión en New York. - Genial. Me estaba sintiendo mal por ti pensar que estarías solo en estas fechas. - Gracias al cielo no es así. Aunque si te soy sincero preferiría pasar con otra persona. - ¿Alex? – hice un sonido de frustración – Bueno, ella viajo a su tierra con todos. - Así me enteré – había visto fotos de ella con su familia. - Vamos. Nada de tristezas. Pronto todo se arreglará. - ¿De verdad crees eso? A duras penas ella me responde algún mensaje. Siento que debería estar a su lado si en verdad quiero recuperarla. - Todo a su tiempo, pequeño. ¿Cuándo estarás definitivamente de regreso? - Febrero. Luego de año nuevo tengo que regresar a Paris y estaré de regreso. - No falta mucho. En todo caso tienes tiempo de planear tu estrategia. Creo que es hora de que Darío también sepa que estás de regreso. - ¿Tú crees? – claro que quería que él se enterara. Pero no quería tenerlo prevenido. - Es lo más justo. Es la única forma de hacer que Alex enfrente lo que siente. Mientras te mantengas al margen ella no tiene nada que pensar. Hazla decidir. - ¿Y sí no me elige? – no quería pensar en esa posibilidad. - Primero lucha. El ganar o perder viene al último. - Eso no es lo que quería escuchar. - Solo digo la verdad. Bueno me tengo que ir. Feliz Navidad, Josh. - Feliz Navidad, Ally. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - Feliz navidad, pequeña – me dijo mi novio sobre mis labios. Nos separamos para abrazar al resto de nuestros amigos y familiares. Habíamos viajado Santy, Fer, Darío, Peter y yo para pasar navidad y año nuevo con mi familia. Tuve que convencer a Peter para venir. No quería que pasara otro año solo en estas fechas. Él es mi hermano, no podía dejarlo. - Feliz Navidad, hermano – Peter me abrazo con mucha fuerza. - Feliz Navidad. Te tengo una sorpresa. – dijo mi hermano llevándome hacia la cocina. - Aun no es momento de dar regalos. - Bueno mi regalo aún está bajo el árbol pero no puedo esperar más para decirte. - Suelta la sopa, entonces. - Todo está listo para que inicies con los proyectos. Los accionistas dieron luz verdad para que uses el nombre de la empresa. - Eso es genial – había podido estudiar y desarrollar la manera de implementar mejoras en el departamento de recursos humanos, pero quería crear una fundación de ayuda para hospitales de bajos recursos. Necesitaba el nombre y el apoyo de la empresa para respaldar. Había propuesto mi proyecto a los demás accionistas y a la junta directiva. A pesar de que los dueños eran Peter, Pool y yo necesitábamos la autorización del resto de inversionistas. Peter había estudiado las probabilidades para llevar acabo todos los proyectos. Su idea era encontrar otras personas u organizaciones que deseen involucrarse ya sea como cofundadores o solo como donadores que apoyen la cusa. - Eso no es todo. Me llamó Collins y dijo que definitivamente él será un cofundador. No pude evitar gritar y abalanzarme sobre Peter. Ryan Collins era uno de los hombres más influyentes y adinerado que he conocido. Sus empresas van desde industrias de alimentos hasta cine. Especialmente en el mercado europeo. Había tenido la oportunidad de presentarle mi proyecto y el hecho de que quiera apoyarme como cofundador en verdad da excelente respaldo y beneficios. No pude ocultar mi entusiasmo en toda la noche. Todo iba cada vez mejor. Ya avanzada la velada mis amigos y sus familias empezaron a retirarse a sus casas. Volverían mañana temprano para desayunar mientras abrimos nuestros regalos y luego ir a la iglesia. - Deja a Ana conmigo. Si la despiertas ahora no te dejará dormir – la pequeña había quedado dormida hace mucho y la habíamos recostado en mi habitación. - ¿Estás segura? – preguntó mi amiga. - Claro. No habrá problema y tendré a quien abrazar. - Yo quiero quedarme y que me abraces – dijo mi novio llegando a nosotros y besando mi mejilla. - No cuentes con ellos jovencito – dijo mi padre. Todos reímos. Era algo incómodo. Mis padres no estaban muy felices cuando se enteraron que Darío y yo compartíamos habitación en Boston. Pensé que se armaría la tercera guerra mundial pero de alguna manera lo tomaron bien. Aunque nos dieron la charla de protección. Fue traumante que tus padres hablen de tu vida sexual a tus 23, casi 24 años. Es algo que mi mente trata de bloquear. - Pues yo aceptaré la oferta de mi cuñada – dijo Santy abrazando a Fer – Necesito festejar la navidad con mi esposita. La forma sugerente de su voz y el movimiento de cejas nos hizo reír a todos. Fueron a despedirse del resto mientras yo me despedía de Darío. - A veces pienso que estaban mejor cuando se odiaban. Eran menos asquerosos. - Naaaaaaa. Era patético escuchar a mi hermano llamar a Fernanda en sus sueños. - Es bueno que sean felices – los miro a la distancia a mis amigos tomados de las manos y cada vez más enamorados que antes. - Nosotros también lo somos y lo seremos. Nos casaremos, tendremos niños, un trabajo, una casa. Todo lo que necesitemos para ser felices. Me congelé por un momento al escuchar sus palabras. Antes tenía mucho miedo de pensar en un futuro porque no creía que en verdad tenía uno. Había tenido tanto miedo de que mi enfermedad regrese y que todos mis planes se esfumen. Solo Josh había hecho que piense en una vida con él, un futuro juntos y una vida plena. Pero todo había quedado en palabras y escuchar ahora a Darío no me causaba emoción precisamente. - Te están esperando – le dije sin responder a su comentario. - Nos vemos más tarde. Feliz navidad. Se fue dándome un beso. Luego de ayudar a mi mamá a limpiar todo subimos a descansar un poco. Empecé a recostarme junto a Ana cuando mi celular vibró con una llamada. Ni siquiera vi quien era y conteste. - Hola – susurré adormecida. - Feliz Navidad, cariño. - Josh… - respondí frustrada. - Nada de eso, Alex. No quiero que estés enojada. Es navidad. Tiempo de paz, amor… tiempo de perdón. He pasado toda la noche esperando el momento adecuado para llamarte y desearte lo mejor esta navidad. Tenía un punto. – Gracias, supongo. - ¿Estás sonriendo? – preguntó. Tomé conciencia de mí mismo y si, estaba sonriendo. – Es el mejor regalo de navidad. Haber podido conseguir una sonrisa tuya en lugar de desprecio. - En estos momentos ni siquiera puedo pensar en una respuesta. Tengo sueño. - Lamento no dejarte dormir. Pero yo no podía hacerlo sin escuchar a la persona más importante e mi vida en estas fechas. No sabes cómo quisiera estar a tu lado. Puedo contarte un secreto. - Mmhmm. - Creo en Dios, pero no soy la persona más religiosa, exactamente. Fui hoy a la iglesia, luego de escuchar al coro, recé. - ¿Rezaste? - Sí. Le agradecí a Dios por ponerte en mi vida de nuevo y le pedí la oportunidad de hacerte feliz. Eso sí que me despertó. – Joshua… - No digas nada. Solo quería decírtelo. Te amo tanto, Alex. Te amo tanto que duele. Te necesito tanto que me asusta. No sabes cuánto daría por tener el poder de retroceder el tiempo y no haberte dejado ir. - No puedes… - Lo sé... – susurró dejándonos en silencio por un rato. – feliz Navidad, mi amor. - Feliz Navidad – susurre antes de que escuchar el sonido que indicaba la terminación de la llamada. Mi corazón dolía aunque no entendía la razón. Esto se estaba tornando difícil. Hooola :) cumplí lo prometido.. actualicé hoy... se q es corto pero creanme q me costó escribirlo..

Nunca pensé que sería algo incómodo estar con ella. Pero parte de mí no quería presionarla aún más. Cenamos en silencio. - Alex… - levanto su mirada. – No quiero que estés enfadada. Solo quiero tener una noche normal. Como antes… - Ya no es como antes, Joshua. – Dejó los cubiertos a un lado – No puedes pretender que olvide todo lo que ha sucedido y simplemente pensar que todo regresaría.[Chapter 82] Capítulo 82 *SEMANAS DESPUES* \"Cada paso que doy, cada dirección que voy. Me hace falta como aire al respirar. Voy tropezando en tu recuerdo, casi loco, casi cuerdo, me hace falta como aire al respirar. (Aire al respirar – AU-D: www_youtube_com/watch?v=aQHqytL-jLU )\" \"¿Cuándo vas a parar?\" \"Nunca dejare de amarte… ¿eso contesta tu pregunta?\" \" :/ \" O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - Bueno Alexandra será un placer trabajar contigo. - Muchas gracias señor Collins. No sabe lo emocionada que estoy. - Dime Ryan, socia. Y sé que lo harás bien. Más tarde me pongo a buscar donantes para la causa y espero convencer a algunos conocidos que se apunten en forma permanente como fundadores. - Es lo que necesitamos. Le enviaré el proyecto inicial a su correo. - Estaba pensando en un par de fiestas de caridad. Puedo invitar a unas celebridades y otros socios. Daríamos a conocer nuestro plan de trabajo al mismo tiempo que recaudamos fondos. La gente rica ama este tipo de eventos. Podemos hacer una aquí en Boston y otra en cualquier ciudad. Los salones de recepción de mis hoteles están a tu disposición. - Claro. Empezaré a organizar todo. Usted solo dígame la lista de invitados y lo que necesito. - No te preocupes. Tú solo da ideas de lo que exactamente quieres hacer. Te enviaré a mi asistente ella se encargara de lo demás. – Empezamos a caminar hacia el ascensor – Peter me dijo que estudiabas. - Sí. Estoy haciendo mi posgrado pero confíe en que no interferirá en nuestros planes. Este semestre estoy tomando menos materias para poder organizarme mejor. - ¿Eso no demorará tu graduación? - Sí. Pero es lo mejor que puedo hacer. Para mí este proyecto es primordial, conseguir mi título solo tardará un poco más, pero lo conseguiré. - Me agradas, chica. – me dio un abrazo cuando llegamos a la puerta del edificio. – estamos en contacto. Corrí a contarle todo a Peter. No podía creer que todo estuviera sucediendo. Mi novio me llevo a cenar fuera en San Valentín. Todo en mi vida parecía encajar excepto… - ¿Qué quieres Joshua? - ¿Seguimos en lo mismo? Odio que me llames así. - Estoy a dos segundos de colgar. – tuve que ir al baño para responder su llamada. Cada vez que ignoraba se dedicaba a insistir hasta que conteste. - Solo quería decirte que estoy de regreso en Boston y… quiero verte. - No – dije rápidamente. Mi corazón por alguna tonta razón estaba latiendo desbocado. - ¿No? Vamos Alex, sabes que no dejaré de insistir hasta que aceptes. Y es mejor vernos en algún lugar neutro a menos que desees que vaya a buscarte. - ¿Algún día me dejaras en paz? – solté frustrada. - No voy a responder a eso. Ahora. Necesito verte. - Yo no quiero. - No me tientes, Alexandra. Sabes que no dudaría en irte a buscar. - Joshua… - En mi departamento. A las seis. En un mensaje te envío la dirección. Colgó antes de poder decirle que no iba a ir. Regresé con mi novio aun sin saber qué hacer con Josh. ¿Qué se supone que debo hacer? - ¿Todo bien? – dijo mi novio cuando volví a mi silla. - Si – respondí dudosa - ¿Recuerdas a Regina? - Tu compañera de posgrado ¿verdad? - Sí. Bueno me llamo a pedirme que cubra su turno de hoy – odiaba mentir – ella me ha cubierto un montón de veces y al parecer tiene una cita esta noche. - ¿toda la noche? – gimió. - No lo creo. Desde las seis en adelante. Si su cita termina pronto vendrá a relevarme. – era la excusa más creíble pero tenía que justificar el hecho de que no pasaré la noche en el hospital. - Rayos. Tenía planeado una velada romántica. Hace tiempo que no hemos… Tenía razón. Nuestra vida era ajetreada y pasamos largas temporadas sin sexo. – A veces creo que solo me quieres por mi cuerpo. Trate de sonar graciosa pero en medio de la bruma que envolvía mi mente, el tono de mi voz fue más duro. Mi novio tomó mi mano y la besó. - Claro que no, Alexandra. Sabes que te amo con todo mi corazón. Cada parte de ti. Lo que tenemos es especial y si, amo hacer el amor contigo… - Lo sé… lo siento. No quise que suene así. Quería bromear. -Tampoco es malo que te recuerde lo mucho que me importas. Volvimos a nuestro departamento. Me puse mi uniforme de residente para no levantar sospechas. Me despedí y partí al encuentro con Josh. No podía evitar preguntarme: ¿qué mierda estaba haciendo? O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Ella tenía que venir. Sabe que soy capaz de cumplir mi palabra. No podía dejar de moverme alrededor de mi departamento. Contaba los segundos para que llegara. Quería tanto verla. Logré sentarme en el sofá porque temí que en mi estado golpear algo. Sonó el timbre y creo que di un salto y corrí a la puerta. Ahí estaba la niña más hermosa mirándome con su ceño fruncido. Vestía su traje de residente, era azul marino, un simple pantalón no muy ajustado y una blusa de manga corta y cuello en v con el logo del hospital. Pero en ella lucía como un traje de pasarela. - Alex… - susurré. No podía dejar de mirarla. Tenerla de nuevo tan cerca era un sueño. - Bien. Ya me viste. Ahora me voy. – se dio vuelta y empezó a caminar por el pasillo. Me apresuré a retenerla atrapándola por su cintura. - No tan rápido pequeña. Tenemos que hablar. - Suéltame, Joshua – siguió tratando de avanzar – No quiero verte y no tenemos nada de que hablar. - Sí que tenemos. – la cargué sobre mi hombro y la dirigí a mi departamento. Ella gritaba que la soltara y daba muy buenas patadas y golpes con sus manos. Una vez adentro la dejé en mi sofá. Se puso de pie inmediatamente acomodándose su ropa. Le tomó un momento analizar todo a su alrededor. - ¿Qué es esto? – había pasado toda la tarde decorando. Llene mi sala de flores y velas y preparé una cena romántica. - ¿Una cena? – me sentía entusiasmado por la idea de que les guste mi detalle. - Ya me había dado cuenta de ello – dijo sarcástica. Su mirada estaba concentrada en la mesa para dos con velas, flores y champagne. Me acerqué por detrás y pasé mis brazos alrededor de su cintura. Esperé que se apartara pero estaba tan absorta en sus pensamientos que no se dio cuenta hasta que deposité un beso en su cuello. - ¿Qué crees que estás haciendo? – dijo en un susurro. Mi beso definitivamente le afectó. Sentía como su aliento quedaba atrapado. - Festejando San Valentín con el amor de mi vida – ella giró para enfrentarme. La estreché a un más para que no pudiera escapar. Nos perdimos en la mirada del otro por unos segundos hasta que ella escondió su mirada. - No sé que estoy haciendo aquí contigo. - Cenar. – me sentí mal al ver su rostro afligido. Sé que prácticamente la obligué a venir pero era la única manera. Con todo el dolor del alma la dejé ir, pero tomé su mano dirigiéndole a la mesa – Espero que aun te guste la lasaña. Nos rodeaba un inmenso silencio mientras servía la cena. Nunca pensé que sería algo incómodo estar con ella. Pero parte de mí no quería presionarla aún más. Cenamos en silencio. - Alex… - levanto su mirada. – No quiero que estés enfadada. Solo quiero tener una noche normal. Como antes… - Ya no es como antes, Joshua. – Dejó los cubiertos a un lado – No puedes pretender que olvide todo lo que ha sucedido y simplemente pensar que todo regresaría. - Sé que no puedo hacer eso. Lo hubiera intentado, Alex. Pero no voy a renunciar a ti. Ya no. No me importa lo que tenga que hacer, si tengo que empezar de nuevo, si tengo que volver hacer que te enamores de mí, solo quiero volver a vivir. Sin ti no tengo vida. - Pues yo ya tengo una vida y tú no estás en ella – dijo poniéndose de pie. Dolían sus palabras pero sabía que las diría. Estaba preparado. Llegué hasta a ella y la apreté contra la pared. Todo mi cuerpo en contacto con el suyo. - ¿Entonces que soy? ¿Un fantasma? Claro que estoy en tu vida. Solo no lo quieres aceptar. Su respiración era errática. No decía nada, solo me miraba. Me acerqué a su cuello y lo acaricie con mis labios. Su cuerpo se estremecía con cada roce. - Deberías dejarme ir antes que mi rodilla este donde te duele. Reí. Esa era la chica que tanto amaba. Astuta, fuerte. Nunca se rendía sin una batalla. - Nada se compara con el dolor que he sentido todo este tiempo sin ti a mi lado. La besé. No podía contenerme más. Necesitaba tan desesperadamente sus labios, necesitaba tanto su cercanía para no pensar en sus palabras. En las que decía que no me quería cerca. Era cierto cada palabra que dije. Sin ella no tenía vida. Pensé que me apartaría, pero el alivio llegó a mí cuando sus manos sujetaron mi camisa atrayéndome aún más y sus labios se movieron al ritmo de los míos. Gemí. No pude evitarlo al sentir como nuestros se amoldaban al del otro. Deje sus labios para poner toda mi atención en su cuello. Se estremecía con cada toque, como siempre lo hacía. Mis manos bajaron a su cadera y luego a sus muslos. Ahora era ella quien gemía y me pude sentir poderoso. Volvía a tener el control. Tomé sus muslos y la levanté. Ella envolvió sus piernas haciendo que nuestras caderas chocaran sacándonos a ambos gemidos de placer. La llevé a mi habitación y la deje en mi cama sin despegarme de ella. Sus manos desabotonaban mi camisa y las mías se filtraban bajo su uniforme para acariciar su piel. Definitivamente estaba en algún sueño. Pero se sentía tan real y tan bien tenerla de nuevo conmigo. Mi camisa cayó al suelo. Detuvimos nuestros besos por un momento. Ella me miraba tan intensamente. Sus dedos acariciaron mi pecho bajando en una línea desde mi clavícula hasta mi ombligo. Deseo. Aun me deseaba como yo a ella. - Es mi turno – susurré. Tome el dobladillo de su blusa y se la quité. Mi boca se secó por la vista. Su hermosa piel morena brillaba con la poca luz que se filtraba desde la sala. Su sujetador negro abrazaba su busto. Mis labios fueron ahí. Rozaron la tersa piel de sus senos para luego hacer su camino de regreso a su cuello y a sus labios. Sus manos viajaban por mi espalda incendiando cada parte que tocaba. Mi cadera chocó con la suya llevándonos al límite de la excitación. Empezamos a movernos de esa manera. Ambos encontrándonos en la mitad del camino y llevándonos al borde. Tendría que estar pronto dentro ella porque si seguíamos a este ritmo no iba a durar mucho. Un sonido estridente empezó a perturbar nuestra burbuja. Era el maldito teléfono. - Deberías contestar – su voz parecía más un gemido. - Si me necesitan volverán a llamar. – volví a atacar sus labios mientras el teléfono seguía sonando. - Hola ¿Josh? Que mal que no estés en casa. Trate de llamar a tu celular pero tampoco tuve éxito. Estoy en Boston y pensé en buscarte para… recordar viejos tiempos. Llámame en cuanto puedas, no importa la hora. Estoy quedándome en el mismo hotel que la última vez. Puedes venir. Te estaré esperando. – la voz de Claudia desapareció luego de un pitido. Había olvidado por completo la contestadora. Ambos nos habíamos detenido cuando el mensaje inició. Abrí mis ojos para encontrarme con la mirada fría de Alex. Mierda. Trate de besarla pero ella me empujó con sus brazos y piernas logrando apartarme. Se puso de pie y tomó su blusa. - Alex… - llamé pero ella continua su labor de acomodar su ropa ignorándome completamente. – Alex. Por favor. Tuve que sostenerla de sus hombros y plantarme frente de ella para que me mirara - ¿Qué? - Lo que escuchaste… no es lo que piensas. Yo… no estoy con…- trataba de explicarle que no tenía nada con Claudia, aunque ella hubiera hecho parecer lo contrario. - No me importa, Joshua. Haz lo que quieras, es tu maldita vida. Solo déjame en paz. – de nuevo se escabulló y se encaminó a mi sala. No quería que se fuera. Deberíamos estar haciendo el amor. No debería estar viéndola irse de nuevo. - No puedes irte, Alex. - Sí que puedo – dijo tomando el pomo de la puerta. - No – empujé la puerta cerrándola. - ¿Cómo qué no? – su voz derramaba furia. - No puedes irte. No después de lo que pasó. - No pasó nada. - ¿Nada? – le interrumpí - ¿Y que fueron todos esos besos? Estuviste a punto de ser mía, Alexandra. Lo que pasó no es \"nada\". - Eso fue un momento de debilidad. No tiene importancia para mí. – esas palabras fueron como una bofeteada. - No hagas esto – dije acercándome. – No digas que no sentiste nada, porque para mí fue lo más maravilloso que me ha ocurrido en mucho tiempo. No pudiste no sentirá nada. - Olvídate de mí Josh – abrió la puerta. – Ve a divertirte con tu… lo que sea y olvídate de mí. - Nunca – dije antes de que cerrara la puerta tras ella. No entendía como terminó un momento perfecto de esta manera. Maldita sea mi suerte. Hooola :) volví... en verdad lamento tanto mis retrasos continuos pero como les dije la proxima semana empiezo mis examenes y resulta que soy la penultima en la lista asi que tengo que presentar millones de trabajos ademas de q los profesores siempre deciden mandar debers y tomar pruebas al último... :) no me maten. Querían un poco de amor/acción ps espero q les haya agradado :) El prox cap lo subiré el día jueves :) Como les dije estoy tratando que la historia avance un poco más rápido aunque admito q a momentos no queda como espero. ¿que les pareció? ¿que creen q pasará? en verdad quiero leer sus opiniones :P He notado que estoy cometiendo muchas faltas ortográficas, espero que me disculpen pero la verdad es q no reviso los capítulos antes de subirlos..! gracias x sus reviews, sobretoso a las personas q se toman un minuto para dejarlos.. no saben lo mucho que me incentiva.. sigan dejándolos :) nos leemos luego -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET AVANCE: \"Q se supone q estás haciendo?\" \"Estaba soñando contigo, ahora respondiendo tu mensaje ;) \" \"JOSHUA... NO JUEGUES CONMIGO!\"[Chapter 83] Capítulo 83 Llegué a mi departamento apenas logrando retener mis lágrimas. Frustración. Era una estúpida. Había dejado que un beso nublara mi mente y mi razón. Había dejado de pensar y simplemente retrocedí en el tiempo. Mi cuerpo, mi alma, toda yo había despertado con esos besos. Y si no hubiera sido por esa llamada habría terminado acostándome con Josh. Era una estúpida. ¿Cómo pude permitir que eso sucediera? Y lo que es aún peor ¿cómo pude querer que sucediera? Puedo mentirme a mí mismo pero no lograría nada. Una parte de mí quiso ese contacto. Una parte de mí aún se aferra al recuerdo de sus dedos en mi piel y sus labios en los míos. Me había perdido en la intensidad de su mirada y en la fuerza de su toque. Había querido volver a ser uno con él. Por un momento olvide quien era. Olvide el daño, los malos ratos. Había olvidado que el ya no tenía cabida en mi vida. Me había olvidado de Darío. Darío. Dormía plácidamente en nuestra cama. Su brazo asomaba sobre el edredón. Trate de no despertarlo mientras me cambiaba y me metía en la cama. Extendió su brazo a mí alrededor. Estrechándome a su cuerpo. – Mmmm ¿Por qué usas mangas largas? Había notado. Normalmente duermo lo más ligera posible pero no soportaría el contacto de sus dedos en mi piel. Aun sentía el toque de Josh. Aún tenía la sensación de sus dedos acariciando mis brazos. Tenía que olvidarlo. – Tengo frío. No dijo nada más. Su respiración se volvió lenta señal de que había sido consumido por el sueño. Aunque creía que no era posible pude dormir, pero mis suelos estuvieron llenos de recuerdos de esta noche. Cuando desperté decidí olvidar todo. No tenía caso torturarme con cosas que no valían la pena. Bloquearía los recuerdos y buscaría soluciones. Pero mis intenciones acabaron cuando esa maldita canción estaba por todo lado. En la televisión, en la radio, en redes sociales y como mensaje en mi celular. Maldito seas, Josh Hutcherson. Quiero que sepas, que junto a todo lo demás, no dejaré que esto se vaya. Estas palabras son mi alma y mi corazón y sabes que me aferraré a este momento, mientras mi corazón sangra por demostrártelo… y no te dejaré ir. (With me – Sun 41: www_youtube_com/watch?v=0S5HPYE3Tkg ) NO QUERÍA QUE ESE MOMENTO TERMINE JAMAS… DONDE TODO ES NADA SIN TI… Apague la radio y el televisor para no escuchar la maldita canción y los malditos chimes de la prensa y sus teorías sobre el misterioso amor de Josh. Pero aún seguía escuchándola, el maldito sonido provenía de mi vecino quien tenía todo el volumen activado. Quería lanzarle un maldito zapato para que apagara esa cosa. Trate de tranquilizarme y me aleje lo más rápido posible de ese lugar. Necesitaba bloquear todo. Llegue a mi salón de clase un poco más calmada. Alyson se sentó junto a mí al mismo tiempo que nuestro profesor apagaba las luces y empezaba su charla con diapositivas. - Tienes una cara terrible ¿qué está mal? - No estaba de humor para hablar con nadie. – Vamos Alex, es solo una canción. Nadie sospecha que va para ti. Aunque todos saben que te ama nadie sospecha que se ven. - ¿Cómo mierda sabes eso? – ahora estaba más que enojada. Con ella. - Lo sospeché. – dijo divertida – Ahora pon tu atención en los neuroblastomas. Miraba pasar las diapositivas y gesticular al conferencista pero no tenía ni una mierda de idea de lo que hablaban. No podía dejar de pensar en la maldita canción. No podía sentir cada palabra como un golpe en mi estómago. Más tarde estaba en mi turno en el área de oncología. - Hola Sammy – dije a la pequeña de 5 años. Su rostro se iluminó al verme llegar. - Alex. Te extrañé. – sus bracitos estaban alrededor de mi cuello. - Yo también, princesa. ¿Cómo te sientes hoy? – la deje en su cama y tomé su registro clínico para mirar su evolución. - Estoy bien pero tengo sueño y no puedo dormir. - ¿Te duele algo? ¿La cabeza? – negó. - Solo no me gusta estar aquí. Extraño mi cama y si no estoy cansada no puedo dormir y las enfermeras no me dejan hacer nada ¿cómo se supone que gaste mis energías? Sonreí. Esta niña era terriblemente inteligente. – Si te portas bien, tomas toda tu medicina y obedeces a las enfermeras te prometo que pronto saldrás de aquí. Sus labios hicieron un puchero y se cruzó de brazos mostrando su frustración - ¿Y eso cuándo será? - Pronto. Cuando puedas salir de aquí te llevaré al refugio de animales para que me ayudes ¿ok? - ¿Me prometes? – su rostro se iluminó. Le mostré mi dedo meñique y ella lo enredo con el suyo. - Prometido. Pero ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer. Mi humor mejoró completamente luego de visitar a mi pequeña. Aquella niña había robado mi corazón desde que la conocí. Fue de mis primeras pacientes en emergencia. Tenía linfoma y estaba siendo tratada con quimioterapia y luego de una terapia se había descompensado demasiado. Llego a emergencia en muy mal estado. Afortunadamente pudimos reestablecerla pero decidimos internarla hasta que termine sus terapias. Entendía su frustración, un hospital no era el ambiente más feliz del mundo y estar todo el día en él resultaba deprimente. Sus padres venían cada vez que podía. Su madre la visitaba por lo menos una vez al día. Era una mujer agradable pero podía ver reflejado el dolor y la frustración por no poder hacer más por su pequeña. - Peter – saludé a mi hermano cuando contesté su llamada. - ¿Dónde estás? – sonaba preocupado. - Saliendo de mí turno. ¿Pasó algo? - Mmmmm – sonaba preocupado – depende de cómo tomes lo que te tengo que decir. Puedo ir por ti y hablamos. - Dale. Te espero. Veinte minutos después estaba cerrando la puerta del auto de Peter. - ¿Te parece bien si vamos a cenar? Asentí y llamé a Fernanda a avisarle mi cambio de planes para que nadie se preocupara. Lo más lógico sería hablar con mi novio pero no he podido mirarlo a los ojos y su voz solo me haría sentir más culpable. - ¿Qué sucede? Me estás preocupando – dije mientras se sentaba frente a mí en la pequeña cabina del restaurante. Habíamos pedido cada uno una hamburguesa y una malteada. - Alex… - dudó - ¿Has estado en contacto con Josh? Me congelé. ¿Cómo se enteró? Mierda. Esto iba por mal camino. - ¿Por qué? - Bueno… él… vino a verme hoy. – MIERDA – No hablamos de ti. No exactamente. Él… quiere invertir en la fundación. Dejó un cheque con su donación y me pidió que le explicará todo para participar de forma más permanente… quiere estar dentro, así como Collins. Maldito seas, Josh. ¿No podía solo dejarme en paz y largarse con su novia? - No estoy diciendo que Josh tenga motivos ocultos. Todo mundo sabe que es una persona caritativa y siempre participa en campañas y todo eso, pero… él podría hacerlo en cualquier otro lado, así que supongo que tú estás implicada en su interés. Quiere esto y estoy seguro que su apoyo ayudará mucho como el de cualquier otro pero no estoy seguro de como tú te sientas con ello después de… de lo que tuvieron. - Lo voy a matar – apoye mis codos en la mesa y tapé mi rostro con mis manos - ¿No puede simplemente dejarme en paz? - Se han visto – dijo afirmando en lugar de preguntar. La camarera nos sirvió nuestra orden por lo que pude evitar responder por un momento. – No sé qué decirte. Pero esta vez tienes que pensar muy bien en qué hacer. Ahora no solo eres tú, también está el proyecto. Josh es una figura pública que seguramente atraerá la atención de personas interesadas en ayudar. Su donación sirve de mucho pero… apoyo lo que tú decidas. - Tienes razón.- la tenía pero me estaba poniendo entre la espada y la pared. Dejar que Josh invada mi vida de esa manera seguramente me va a traer más problemas de los que ya tengo. Tendré que verlo seguido y él tendrá la perfecta excusa para inmiscuirse en mi camino. Me había atrapado, completamente. - Piénsalo. Yo te apoyo en lo que decidas. No sé qué haya pasado entre ustedes ahora, puede que ni siquiera importe porque cada uno tiene su vida, pero no quiero que te haga daño esa decisión. Harás lo correcto. - Quisiera tener esa misma confianza en mí que tú tienes. Por suerte Darío dormía para cuando llegué a mi departamento. Me recosté a su lado y él inmediatamente me envolvió entre sus brazos. Se sentía mal. Terriblemente mal e incorrecto. Alcancé mi celular de la mesita cuando noté que estaba completamente dormido. \"Q se supone q estás haciendo?\" \"Estaba soñando contigo, ahora respondiendo tu mensaje ;) \" \"JOSHUA... NO JUEGUES CONMIGO!\" \"Nunca lo haría. Si te refieres a mi interés en tu proyecto es eso. Quiero estar ahí. Me parece una magnífica idea y está muy bien diseñado. Quiero ayudar, quiero trabajar y sacarlo adelante. Y SÍ. También lo hago por ti. Es mi manera de asegurar tenerte cerca. Dos pájaros de un tiro.\" \"No te quiero ahí. No te quiero en ningún lado en mi vida\" \"Cariño, puedes rechazar mi oferta y no dejarme está ahí. Pero no saldré de tu vida.\" \"Te odio\" \"No lo haces. Me amas, solo eres lo suficientemente orgullosa para no aceptarlo\" No respondí. Estaba enojada por su actitud. Estaba enojada conmigo por no poder detenerlo. Le había dado el suficiente material para jugar conmigo. \"Aún recuerdo tus besos. Aun siento tu piel bajo mis dedos. Aún estoy lleno de anhelo por no haber llegado al final contigo. Maldigo al destino por eso. Pero te recuperaré. Así me cueste la vida, Alex.\" Hooola :) aquí está el cap q prometí ayer...! Se que muchos deben estar odiandome x como se ve todo. Parece que cada capítulo va de mal en peor para esos dos. Yo mismo me odio por complicar todo pero como me dijo mi profesor de psiquiatría: SI QUIERES QUE UNA PERSONA REFLEXIONE SOBRE SU VIDA, TOME DESICIONES IMPORTANTES, ENFRENTE SUS MIEDOS DEBES SOMETERLES AL CONFLICTO y eso es lo que estoy haciendo. Hay veces que quiero solucionar todo en un capítulo pero al mismo tiempo me doy cuenta que si quiero q sea todo creíble no puedo xq han pasado por mucho como para que se resuelva todo de manera muy simple. Se que Josh está haciendo todo lo posible por recuperarla y ella esta decidida a apartarlo pero tiene q saber que ella era \"feliz\" sin Josh, no puede solo recibirlo de regreso. x eso elconflicto para q enfrente lo q en verdad siente. y creo q llegarán a odiarla. como les he dicho antes estoy tratando de avanzar rápido estos caps para que no me odien mucho y para que disfruten de momentos lindos, llenos de amor entre esos 2.. ! Gracias x sus reviews y espero q los sigan dejando :) en verdad quiero saber q opinan y q creen q pasará :) Nos leemos el domingo :) .-,.-.-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: Ella tiene miedo. Tiene miedo de que todo lo que digo es verdad. No quiere aceptar lo que siente, prefiere estar en negación y no enfrentarse a la realidad. No son solo mis ilusiones. Lo sentí. Sentí su entrega aquella noche. Sentí como su corazón latía bajo mi tacto y como su alma abrazaba la mía con anhelo. Simplemente no se puede entregar a una persona de esa manera si no la más.[Chapter 84] Capítulo 84 - Creo que te estás pasando de la raya. – murmuró Avan. - ¿Qué se supone que haga, entonces? - No sé pero en lugar de enamorarla debe estar cabreada. Sonreí. Sin duda estaba cabreada, pero sabía que era una manera para llegar a ella. Sabía que mientras más frustrada se siente, más se cuestionaría sobre lo que pasa entre nosotros. - Te aseguro que lo está. - ¿Por qué mejor no la dejas en paz y buscas una chica que te corresponda? Claudia estaría más que dispuesta. Esos comentarios solo me hacían sentir sombrío. – Sabes que no puedo. Lo intenté. - Puedes intentarlo de nuevo. – sugirió esperanzado. Simplemente él no entendía que mi corazón siempre le pertenecería a ella. Si Alex no volvía a mí tendría que buscar la manera de permanecer en su vida aunque me mate verla con otro. Pero hay algo. Una pequeña esperanza. Algo que me dice que no me dé por vencido. Quise verla en su cumpleaños, pero trabajó todo su día. No contesta mis mensajes. Está desesperada porque la deje en paz. No quiere enfrentarme. Es por ello que no la dejo en paz. Ella tiene miedo. Tiene miedo de que todo lo que digo es verdad. No quiere aceptar lo que siente, prefiere estar en negación y no enfrentarse a la realidad. No son solo mis ilusiones. Lo sentí. Sentí su entrega aquella noche. Sentí como su corazón latía bajo mi tacto y como su alma abrazaba la mía con anhelo. Simplemente no se puede entregar a una persona de esa manera si no la más. Luego de que Avan se vaya me vestí y preparé para los eventos de hoy. Esta noche la veré… a ella y a su novio. Estaba prácticamente iniciando la primera batalla. Cuando llegué al hotel donde se llevaría a cabo el evento de presentación del proyecto, estaba casi lleno. Había mucha gente influyente y famosa conocida del medio en que me desenvuelvo. - Sr. Collins – busqué a mi nuevo mejor amigo. - Josh. Es un gusto verte por aquí. – me ofreció su mano. - No podía faltar. Estoy muy interesado en ser parte de todo esto – no sabe cuánto. - Esa era la idea de hacer esta pequeña reunión. Mientras más donativos y personas quieran colaborar sacaremos adelante cada una de las propuestas. Yo me enamoré del proyecto en cuanto lo leí. Es una forma de ayudar a la comunidad de una manera útil. Créeme que ya he hecho todo lo de los donativos y caridad y no he sentido que ha servido de algo, no he mejorado la vida de esas personas. Garantizar en lo posible la salud de todos esos niños me hace sentir satisfecho. - Creo que tu entusiasmo bastaría para convencer a todos. - La verdad es que estoy muy entusiasmado. Ayer mi socia, Alexandra, me llevo a visitar el área de oncología del hospital donde trabaja y poder hacer algo por todos esos niños, esas familias me ha entusiasmado. - Definitivamente quiero estar adentro. – y aunque mi motivación era egoísta también quería ayudar. - Solo tienes que llamar a mi asistente y ella te dirá que tipo de donaciones puedes hacer. - Buenoooo… estaba pensando en otra forma de colaborar. Quiero estar de lleno en el proyecto. Dedicarle mi tiempo a que todo se lleve a cabo. – no solo dedicaría mi vida al proyecto, estaba dedicando mi vida a Alex. - Eso es fantástico, Josh. Tengo que presentarte a mi socia. Es una chica encantadora, muy inteligente. Es la visionaria de todo esto. La amarás. – Ya lo hago – Collins me miró sin entender lo que dije así que decidí ser sincero. Le conté un poco de mi historia. Lo suficiente para que entendiera lo mucho que la amo. Había trabajado para él y sabía que tenía un hilo romántico. - El mundo es un pañuelo pero voy a ayudarte en lo que pueda. Alexandra es una gran chica y tú también lo eres. Sabía que la conocía de algún lado pero no la relacioné contigo. - Ella es… mi vida. La quiero de regreso. - Pues es una buena noche para empezar con ello. Ahí está – dijo viendo sobre mi hombro. Giré para ver a la hermosa mujer de la que estoy locamente enamorado más radiante que nunca. Sonreía mientras saludaba a varias personas. Su vestido rosa brillaba en su piel morena. Su cabello peinado en un moño alto mostraba aquel cuello que hace unos días había besado. Tenía que admitir que prefiero sus rizos sueltos para enredarlos en mis dedos. Nuestras miradas se cruzaron y pude sentir aquella conexión. La fuerza que me arrastraba hacia ella. Retiro la mirada cuando Darío tomó su mano para seguir su camino. - Es la hora, Josh. – dijo Collins. Allá voy. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - ¿Te dije lo hermosa que luces? – Darío susurró en mi oído antes de tomar mi mano y entrar en el gran salón. Todo estaba perfectamente organizado y no se debía precisamente a mi trabajo. La asistente del Sr. Collins se encargó de cada detalle de ambas veladas. La primera aquí en Boston y la siguiente, la próxima semana en Los Ángeles. - Sí. Lo hiciste en el departamento, en el taxi y ahora. - Pues lo estás. Acostúmbrate a escucharlo. Besé su mejilla antes de empezar a saludar a los invitados. Muchos me felicitaron por el proyecto y mostraron su entusiasmo. Estaba encantada ver la gran acogida que hemos tenido. En medio de todos los saludos mi cuerpo se estremeció. Una sensación que no podía identificar se disparó por todo mi cuerpo. Levanté mi mirada y me encontré con aquellos ojos marrones a quienes tanto les temo. Nuestras miradas se encontraron y mi pulso se aceleró. Mi cuerpo reconocía su cercanía antes de que mi cerebro si quiero lo detecte. Mi corazón se volvía loco cuando mis ojos lo encontraban. No podía dejar de mirarlo. Darío tomó mi mano volviéndome a mi realidad. La realidad en la que no podía permitirme ser afectada por un chico que no es para mí. Sujeté fuertemente la mano de mi novio cuando vi a Josh venir en mi dirección. Finalmente todo saldría a la luz. Ahora todo sería real. Su encuentro, la amenaza de su presencia en mi vida. - Alexandra – no había notado al Sr. Collins. La mano de mi novio se tensó en la mía y supe que había notado a Josh. Era algo obvio pues estaba parado a dos pasos de nosotros junto a Collins con una sonrisa satisfecha. - Sr. Collins ¿cómo está? – me concentré en el rostro de mi socio tratando de evitar lo inevitable. Sabía que Darío estaba mirando a Josh. - Encantando por el éxito de la velada. No sé si tienes el gusto de conocer a Josh – señalo al susodicho a su lado, lo que me obligó a mirarlo – Está interesado en participar en el proyecto como parte activa. Maldito, rufián. Tenía que recurrir a Collins. Podía negarme si nadie sabía de sus intenciones pero ahora no podía evitar una maldita razón para alejarlo sin que suene egoísta (por mi total \"desprecio\" hacia él) o patética (por no poder separar mi vida personal de las otras). - De hecho tengo el gusto de conocerla – maldita sonrisa. Me ofreció su mano y tuve que aceptarla. No podía ser maleducada. Al estrecharla sentí como la mano de mi novio me sujetaba más fuerte aún. - Mucho mejor si se conocen, hará las cosas más simples. – aseguró Collins. - Darío – Josh le ofreció a mano a mi novio quien acepto su saludo. Por un momento se miraron desafiándose el uno al otro. Temía que en cualquier momento empezarán los golpes. - Si tenemos el gusto de conocernos – tenía que romper la tensión. - Ya envié todo lo necesario a Peter para analizar la posibilidad de mi participación – dijo Josh mirándome fijamente. Ni siquiera disimulaba su interés. - Lo estamos analizando – en cuanto las palabras salieron de mi boca supe el gran error que cometí. Darío me miró cuestionando y tratando de entender mis palabras. - Pues no creo que haya ningún inconveniente. He trabajado con Josh en otras situaciones y se de primera mano el empeño que pone en cada proyecto. Quería vomitar. Me sentía entre la espada y la pared. - Lo mejor sería que traten el tema con más tiempo – sugirió mi novio, en su voz se notaba el enojo. – Si nos disculpan debemos buscar a Peter. - No hay problema. Nos veremos para cuando empiece la presentación. ¿Vamos, Josh? Quiero presentarte a algunos socios. Me miró por un momento más, su sonrisa de satisfacción no se borraba de la cara. Me ofreció su mano en señal de despedida, le di la mía y él deposito un beso el torso. – Nos vemos luego. Lo vi seguir a Collins y lo odié por el infierno que acaba de desatar. Darío tiró de mí fuera del salón. Llegamos al recibidor del hotel y de ahí una pequeña sala que se encontraba vacía. Sabía que estaba furioso y no estaba preparada para lo que venía. - Lo has visto ¿verdad? – dijo enfrentándome – has estado en contacto con él y encima está dispuesto a inmiscuirse en tus asuntos. - Yo… - Ni siquiera quiero saber si ha pasado algo entre ustedes – gritó. - No ha pasado nada – mentí. Era una mentirosa. – Si lo he visto pero nada ha pasado. Solo lo veo como una persona que quiere formar parte de este proyecto. - Y supongo que lo aceptarás ¿verdad? - No lo sé. No quiero pero no tengo una buena excusa para no aceptar. - Si no quieres verlo simplemente puedes negarte, Alexandra. – grito furioso. Me estremecí. Nunca lo había visto de esta manera. – Si lo dejas entrar estarás dándole lo que quiere. No estoy ciego, Josh aún te quiere a su lado. Te comía con la mirada, ni siquiera disimuló ante mi presencia. - ¿Cómo se supone que me niegue? No puedo decirle a Collins que rechazó la ayuda que necesitamos simplemente porque tú no quieres a mi exnovio cerca. - Ves lo que digo. Tú deberías quererlo lejos, no solo yo. Sabes que su presencia solo complicará nuestra situación. - No tiene por qué serlo, Darío. Te amo. A ti, no a él. Nuestra relación ya es historia. Cada uno tiene su vida. ¿Piensas que te dejaría solo porqué él este de regreso? ¿Te he dado motivos para que desconfíes de mis sentimientos? Era una persona horrible. En algún momento me había convertido en una mentirosa, traicionera y manipuladora. - No. No me has dado motivos pero no lo quiero cerca de ti. Pero ahora me los estás dando, me has ocultado que lo has visto, me has ocultado que quiere ser parte de tu fundación. - Sí. Te he ocultado porque sabía cómo reaccionarías no porque suceda algo más. Peter me dijo sobre sus intenciones y aunque no quiera tengo que hacer lo que sea mejor para la fundación. No puedo mezclar mis problemas personales con esto. Si quiere estar dentro tiene que cumplir con ciertos requisitos y Collins debe aprobarlo al igual que yo. - Niégate. No puedes dejar que entre en tu vida tan fácilmente de nuevo. – su voz era una súplica. Sabía que tenía razón, Josh nos traería problemas pero no podía dejarlo fuera sin una buena razón me convertía en una persona más egoísta aún, al no dejar de lado mis prejuicios por el bien de los demás. - Si Collins lo aprueba yo tendré que hacerlo. Sin una buena razón no puedo negarme. Darío me miró por un momento y luego dejo escapar un bufido. – ¿Es eso? ¿No lo dejas fuera porque no puedes negarte o no lo dejas fuera porque no quieres apartarlo de ti ahora que regresó? No podía estar hablando en serio ¿verdad? Yo ya no quería a Josh en mi vida y él debería saberlo. Simplemente estaba entre la espada y la pared y tenía que hacer lo correcto. Josh ya no era para mí, ya no sentía nada por él… ¿verdad? - Estas siendo injusto conmigo. - No me has respondido. – dijo mirándome fijamente. - Después de todo este tiempo… no me conoces – debería saber que ya no quiero a Josh. Él es ahora el hombre de mi vida, le he dado todo de mí y él simplemente piensa lo peor. – Deberías irte. - Debería - dijo mirándome seriamente – Pero no te dejaré cerca de él. Aprovecharía mi ausencia para acercarse a ti. - Claro que se acercará y claro que lo tendré que ver, no solo está noche quizás muchas veces. Que este o no sola no cambiará lo que siento ni lo que pienso. Prefiero que te vayas. No estoy cómoda aquí contigo. - No esta noche. – tomó mi mano y me llevo de regreso al salón. No tuve tiempo de reprochar porque estábamos rodeados de gente. Su brazo rodeo mi cintura acercándome a él como si todo estuviera bien. Como si nada hubiera pasado y fuéramos la pareja de siempre. Peter nos hizo una señal para acercarnos a la mesa en que se sentaba. Pude ver nuestros nombres en ella y me senté donde me correspondía con Darío a mi lado. Collins se apresuró a tomar su lugar entre mi novio y Peter. Trataba de prestar atención de su conversación pero mi mente divaga en todo lo que sucedía. Por culpa de Josh, mi relación estaba al borde y me había convertido en una persona que vil. El brazo de Darío se aferró con fuerza a mi cuerpo sacándome de mis pensamientos. Miré para encontrarme con sus ojos llenos de furia y dirigidos a algo sobre mi hombro. Seguí su mirada para encontrarme con Josh sentado a mi lado. Simplemente genial. Me apreté a mi novio y me concentré en ignorarlo. Collins dio inicio al evento agradeciendo la presencia de los invitados, también dio una breve presentación de todo el proyecto y la forma en que pueden participar y hacer donativos. Recibió muchos aplausos al igual que yo luego de que mi socio me presentara como la mentora de todo. Luego de todo el protocolo procedieron a servirnos la cena. Ignorar a Josh fue de cierta manera fácil ya que no intento nada y permaneció callado. Mientras cenábamos pude mirarlo de reojo. Su ceño estaba fruncido. Estaba molesto y no entiendo la razón. Si tengo algo que ver con su actitud no me interesa, él sabía lo que hacía. Cuando nos sirvieron el postre lo atrapé mirándome. Nuestros ojos hicieron contacto y rápidamente miré hacia otro lado. Me sentía incómoda con su presencia. Si él quería podía decirle a Darío todo lo que ha sucedido desde que nos vimos, no estaría impresionada si lo hiciera, pero una parte de mí sabía que no abriría su boca. Odiaba sentir que me tiene en sus manos. Miré a mi novio quien estaba concentrado en su charla con Peter, Collins y un socio de este. Capté un poco de la conversación. Hablaban sobre proyectos hoteleros, obviamente mi novio estaba tan absorbido por su pasión que yo podía pararme en la mesa y hacer un streptease sin que él gire a mirarme. - ¿Vas a ignorarme toda la noche? – la voz de Josh hizo que me estremeciera – Te advierto que haré una escena si sigue con esa actitud. - ¿Me estás amenazando? - Solo estoy diciendo lo que pienso. De alguna manera tengo que lograr que me hables. - Lo único que logras es cabrearme. - Siento eso, pero no se me ocurre otra manera. Solo quiero tener una conversación decente contigo. No quiero tener que defenderme de tus ataques cada vez que nos encontramos. - ¿Estás haciéndote la víctima? Esto es el colmo. – él lograba enfadarme. - No. – dijo pensativo – ves a lo que me refiero. Cada vez que quiero hablar contigo solo me respondes como si fuera lo peor que existe. Ni siquiera me tratas como una persona. Un valde de agua cayó sobre mí. ¿En verdad me había convertido en una perra amargada? Con él parece que sí. Pero Josh es tan… molesto, irritante. – Lo siento por eso. Tienes razón. A pesar de todo no debería comportarme como una perra contigo ni con nadie. Mi comentario lo hizo sonreír – No quiero que te sientas mal por mí. Solo quiero poder charlar contigo sin que alguno de nosotros quiera estrangula al otro. - No se me había pasado por la mente estrangularte. Eso dejaría mucho rastro. - Creo que puedes ingeniar algo mejor después de todos esos capítulos de CSI y Bones. ¿aún los ves? Una sensación de calidez me azotó al notar que recordaba esos detalles. – Cuando tengo tiempo. Aunque tengo programado para que se grabe los capítulos cuando no estoy y los veo de corrido en mi tiempo libre. Aun me obsesiona. - Es bueno saber que algunas cosas no cambian. Me sentía cómoda hablando con él de esta manera. Mientras la palabra \"nosotros\" no entre a colocación todo estaba bien. - ¿Aun vez Naked Science? - Por supuesto. Cada vez aprendo algo nuevo. Las camareras retiraron la vajilla que quedaba dejando un jarrón de agua y vasos para cada uno. Una de ellas le guiñó a Josh y señaló con un gesto de su cabeza a la servilleta sobre la que colocó su vaso. Se fue con una gran sonrisa. Josh tomó la servilleta y me mostró el número que aquella chica había apuntado. - ¿Te pasa seguido? - No mucho. Admito que me encontrado con personas más creativas. De alguna manera la idea de chicas lanzándose hacia él me molestó más de lo que debería. En realidad no debería molestarme en lo absoluto. – Es bueno que tengas de donde escoger. - No me interesa. Si tú pusieras tu número en este papel me importaría. – dijo sonriendo abiertamente. - Creo que ya tienes mi número. - El detalle está en que me lo des porque quieres que lo tenga. Eso me daría la excusa perfecta para llamarte, escribirte y decirte lo hermosa que eres. De alguna manera estoy emocionada y horrorizada por su audacia. Sabía cómo embelesarme con sus palabras.- ¿De verdad estas coqueteando conmigo con mi novio justo aquí? Miró sobre mí hacia Darío que aún estaba embelesado en la conversación y había abandonado su agarre sobre mi mano. - Darío está ocupado. Al parecer su charla es más interesante que… otras cosas. – suspiró y me miró fijamente. Supe que aquel cómodo momento se había esfumado. – No quiero enojarte pero mereces más que esto. Mereces a un hombre que te tenga en primer lugar dentro de sus prioridades. - Soy su prioridad – dije en un susurro. - No parece.- dijo mirando a mi novio nuevamente - ¿recuerdas cuando estábamos juntos? Nunca te puse en un segundo lugar. Siempre fuiste mi todo, Alexandra. Cada minuto era insuficiente para adorarte y cuando estábamos separados seguías siendo todo lo que pensaba. Eras la razón de que mi corazón latiera, la dueña de cada aliento. Eras… eres el motivo por el cual sigo cada día. Muchas veces te ofrecí abandonar todo por ti, no me arrepiento de lo que dije porque cada palabra es verdad. Nada es un sacrificio mientras te tenga como recompensa. Mereces ese tipo de amor y mucho más. Mi pecho apretaba y mis ojos se humedecían. No entendía como unas palabras tan dulces podían abrir heridas tan grandes. Me puse de pie en busca de un lugar seguro. Un lugar lejos de Josh y de mi novio. Un lugar en donde mi corazón no duela y mi alma no se rompa. Hooola :) Aki estoy con un nuevo cap.. debería estar estudiando pero nooo.. estoy escribiendo :) ¿Q les pareció? creo q cada vez me enamoró ma de Josh... y personalmente amé escribir el sigueinte capítulo... Se q m odia x complicar todo.. lo lamento muchoooooooooooooooo..!

Por lo pronto hasta el cap 90 veran mucho conflicto y quizas no les agrade el punto a donde va a llegar.. pero de ahí tendremo un poco mas de acción.. se los prometo y luego vendrá esta sección de la q les hablaba. :) Espero ansiosa sus comentarios y predicciones.. gracias a quienes se toman un momento para esciribirme.. no importa si es para decirme que no les gusto... x lo menos se q logró alguna emoción :) Nos leemos luegooo.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET AVANCE: - Esto no tiene sentido, Josh. – su aliento rozaba con el mío. Estaba perdiéndome en el millón de sensaciones que ella provocaba. Nadie podía cortar ese hilo que nos conectaba. Esa atracción que nos había unido desde el día que nos conocimos. - ¿Qué cosa? - Moví mi cabello a un lado y acerqué su cara a mi cuello, envolviéndome a un más en su aroma. Cerró sus ojos cuando mis labios se posaron en su hombro haciendo que se estremeciera y que un pequeño suspiro escapara de su boca. No podía negarlo. Yo también podía afectarla de la misma manera que ella a mí. Mantuvo sus ojos cerrados mientras respondía – Esto. Tú y yo. No tiene sentido.[Chapter 85] Capítulo 85 La vi correr lejos de mí. No era lo que esperaba después de declararle mi amor pero debí suponer que le haría daño. Soy un imbécil. Miré al estúpido de su novio que ni siquiera se había percatado de que ella no estaba. Caminé en la dirección que tomó. El baño de mujeres. Debí suponerlo. Vi salir a dos señoras de ahí, esperé un momento por si alguien más salía y luego de un momento entré. Nuestras miradas se encontraron a través del espejo. Eché el cerrojo a la puerta del baño y la enfrente. Ella bajo la vista al grifo y metió sus manos en el agua. Su cercanía provocaba que todo mi ser quisiera saltar sobre ella. Su perfume llegó a mi nariz envolviéndome en ese dulce y atrayente aroma. - Este es el baño de mujeres – dijo aun mirando sus manos. - Lo sé. - ¿Entonces qué haces aquí? – preguntó mientras tomaba una toalla de papel para secarse. - Tenía que verte a solas. - ¿Para qué? – odiaba cuando preguntaba cosas obvias solo para ganar tiempo. - ¿Crees que necesito una razón? - Si – su voz sonó duro, pero tenía un tono de nerviosismo que ella trataba de esconder. No quería hacerme ilusiones pero sentía que mi cercanía también le afectaba. - ¿Por qué? – empecé a acercarme. A su vez, ella retrocedía hasta que se encontró con una pared. - Porque no somos nada y no quiero tenerte cerca. Eso te lo dejado claro todas las veces que nos hemos encontrado. - ¿Por qué? – estaba frente a ella. Trataba de encontrar su mirada. - ¿Necesito una razón para no quererte cerca? Porque tengo una lista de la que podrías elegir si quieres verla aunque creo que eres lo suficientemente inteligente para saber cuáles son mis puntos. - Amo cuando usas el sarcasmo – apoye una de mis manos contra la pared a nivel de su cabeza – Esa parte tuya de responder tan rápidamente de una manera inteligente siempre me ha parecido intrigante. - Gracias. Me alegra saber que soy un objeto de estudio. - Este no es momento para sarcasmo, Alexandra. - Tienes razón. Es momento de que yo regresé con MI novio. – recordar a ese me dolió. Cuando ella estaba cerca de mí no podía más que pensar en su presencia mientras que ella siempre lo tenía presente. - No te vayas - le susurré suplicante cuando trato de pasar junto a mí. De alguna manera ella volvió a estar contra la pared y mis antebrazos apoyados en ella a cada lado de su cabeza. Nuestros rostros solo estaba a centímetros. - Esto no tiene sentido, Josh. – su aliento rozaba con el mío. Estaba perdiéndome en el millón de sensaciones que ella provocaba. Nadie podía cortar ese hilo que nos conectaba. Esa atracción que nos había unido desde el día que nos conocimos. - ¿Qué cosa? - Moví su cabello a un lado y acerqué mi cara a su cuello, envolviéndome a un más en su aroma. Cerró sus ojos cuando mis labios se posaron en su hombro haciendo que se estremeciera y que un pequeño suspiro escapara de su boca. No podía negarlo. Yo también podía afectarla de la misma manera que ella a mí. Mantuvo sus ojos cerrados mientras respondía – Esto. Tú y yo. No tiene sentido. - Yo diría que tiene mucho sentido. – Mis labios subieron hasta su oreja acariciando todo el trayecto. Amaba sentirla reaccionar bajo mis caricias. Lo que no soportaba es que ella tratara de ocultarlo. - No – susurró – Ya no tiene sentido para mí. Todo quedó en el pasado. Su tono era suplicante. No sabía a quién quería convencer pero solo basto esa pequeña vacilación en ella para devolverme todas las esperanzas a mi vida. - ¿Estás segura de que ya no sientes nada por mí? ¿Qué todo quedó olvidado en el pasado? – susurré en su oído. - S-si - su voz se entrecorta y yo le levanto el mentón lentamente hasta quedar de nuevo viendo a sus ojos. - Entonces… - por impulso me voy acercando cada vez a ella - sería bueno recordar - le digo ya muy cerca de sus labios, sintiendo el roce de su nariz - ¿no lo crees? - No. Por favor, no lo hagas – me rogó, pero no podía acceder a su petición. - ¿Qué cosa? – susurré mientras pegaba mi cuerpo al suyo completamente. - No me beses – me suplicó – Por favor. No lo hagas. - ¿Por qué? – yo sabía el millón de \"porques\" que ella podría decir pero quería que ella me diera un valido. Un porque que me impida luchar contra esto que siento, pero creo que no lo hay. - Porque nada cambiara… - No me importa ni una mierda - y como lo hice cuando eramos novios, le acuné la cara con mis manos y acorté la poca distancia entre nosotros, sellando nuestros labios en un beso que puede explicar tantas cosas y hacer sentir muchas a la vez. Mis labios la besan con ternura y me corresponde. Ella lleva sus manos alrededor de mi cuello y yo la apego más a mí rodeándola a la altura de su cintura. Mientras le demuestro mi amor por ella en este beso, descubro que estoy haciendo lo correcto. Luchar por ella es lo que debo hacer. Ella es la chica de mis sueños, la única que siempre podrá hacerme sentir completo, es todo lo que necesito para ser feliz. Tomé su cabello y la atraje más cerca de mí, si eso era aún posible. Dejé el beso dulce para pasar a devorar sus labios con desesperación y pronto ambos estábamos jadeando. Mis dos manos no eran suficientes para tocarla. Mi cuerpo ansiaba su contacto de una manera casi enferma. La necesitaba como si fuera droga. Mordí su labio inferior para después acariciarlo lentamente mi lengua. Eso la hizo gemir provocando que me excitara. Nos separamos lentamente, manteniendo nuestras frentes unidas. Ella intentaba recuperar el aliento con grandes bocanadas de aire, mientras que yo sentía como si por primera vez en mucho tiempo volvía a respirar. Sus ojos ahora me miraban y aunque esperé encontrar amor en ellos no pude evitar sentirme alegre de que reflejaran duda. Ella tenía un conflicto interno y eso bastaba para mí. Por ahora. - Dime que no sientes nada por mí - la desafié – Dime que este beso no significó nada para ti y hazlo mirándome a los ojos. - No te amo – susurró. Aunque debería dolerme esas palabras supe que mentía. No quiero decir que ella me amé, tal vez ella mismo sabía que sentía. Pero había algo ahí. - Puedes decirme miles de veces que no me amas, Alexandra. Puedes mentirme y mentirme a ti misma diciendo que no sientes nada, quizás tu misma no lo comprendes. ¿Pero sabes qué? Nuestro amor fue algo grande y aunque trates de esconderlo sé que está ahí, en algún lugar. Puedes hacerme daño con tus palabras y tratar de alejarme, puedes besar a otro hombre, y negar mil veces que esto que hay entre nosotros existe - dije poniendo una mano en su corazón - Esto siempre te delatará. Tu corazón siempre te guiará hacia mí porque soy lo que en verdad necesita. Me sentía tan bien diciendo esas palabras. Ella me apartó y empezó a dirigirse hacia la puerta. La sujeté de su mano obligándola a mirarme. - Déjame ir – susurró. Sabía que no se refería a este momento. Sabía que hablaba de su vida, ella quería que abandonara esta lucha. - Nunca – respondí antes de soltarla y verla salir por aquella puerta. Salí del baño y abandoné la fiesta. No soportaría verla de nuevo al lado de ese. En este momento me sentía lo suficientemente feliz como para permitir que algo me quité el entusiasmo por haber logrado lo de hoy. Ella tenía que amarme. En algún lado estaban todos esos sentimientos por mí. Y tendría que sacarlos de alguna manera. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O ¿Era verdad? ¿Aún lo amaba? Lo deseaba, Sí, eso había quedado demostrado con todos esos besos y esos arranques. Pero no podía amarlo. Ya no. Había pasado por tanto para rehacer mi vida y en verdad era feliz sin él. ¿Cómo puede afectarme tanto su toque? ¿Cómo puede herirme de esa manera cada palabra? No lo sabía ni lo entendía pero tampoco quería cuestionármelo. Solo era consciente que mi vida iba en caída y directo a una maraña de problemas que no sé cómo afrontar. Volví a mi lugar en aquella mesa. Había logrado que mi respiración se tranquilice y que mi corazón dejara de latir erradamente. Josh no estaba en su lugar, por lo menos había hecho algo bueno por mí, si se hubiera quedado no sabría cómo actuar. Darío me miro ceñudo cuando me senté a su lado. Todos los invitados estaban bailando o dialogando y mi novio se había quedado solo en aquella mesa. - ¿Dónde estabas? – me pregunto con su voz rebosando de ira. - En el baño – traté de que mi voz sonará tranquila. No quería pensar en qué hacer, si debo decirle o no. no quería enfrentar la realidad en la que era una pésima persona, que había engañado a mi novio y no se decidía a enfrentar la situación. - Casualmente te vas cuando Josh también lo hace. – obviamente no se le pasaría eso por desapercibido. - No quiero reclamos. Solo vengo por mi cartera y me voy. – así lo hice. Tomé mis cosas y salí a la calle en busca de un taxi. Darío estuvo a mi lado justo cuando el auto se paró junto a la acera. Subí y él lo hizo tras mío. El viaje al departamento fue totalmente silencioso. Miraba por la ventana las luces de la calle tratando de concentrarme en ellas. No quería pensar en lo que iba a pasar pero sabía que tendría que tomar una decisión. Ambos entramos en nuestra habitación. Me senté en la cama. Vi a Darío armar su maleta y no sabía qué hacer para detenerlo. Parte de mí quería que se quedara y me abrazara pero otra parte me culpaba por lo hipócrita que era. Abrió su portátil que estaba sobre el escritorio junto a ventana y lo vi enviar un mensaje a su profesor. Seguramente confirmando su asistencia para esta pasantía. Él se había negado ir para acompañarme en estos dos eventos, ahora él quería estar lo más lejos posible. Se encontró con mi mirada y habló. - ¿Vas a negarte que Josh entre en tu sociedad? - No puedo hacerlo. No tengo motivos para rechazarlo. - Bien. Pues tienes que elegir entre él o yo. No lo quiero en mi vida. - Estas siendo tan injusto, Darío. - ¿Yo soy injusto? ¿Y quién piensa en lo que siento? Nadie. No lo quiero en mi vida ni la tuya y él esta obstinado en estar en ella. ¿Cómo puedes pedirme que lo acepte sabiendo que quiere apartarte de mi lado? - Josh puede quererme pero yo no a él. Eso debería ser suficiente para ti. - Pues no lo es. – tomó su valija y fue a su puerta. – Me voy a un hotel esta noche. Nos vemos en dos semanas y espero en verdad que tomes la decisión correcta. Se fue. Me dejo sola cuando más confundida me sentía, cuando más lo necesitaba. No fue necesario decirles nada a mis amigos, de alguna manera, Santiago y Fernanda se enteraron de todo lo que sucedió y obviamente estaban de acuerdo con Darío. Sabía que tenían razón pero no podía huir de lo inevitable. No podía detener mi vida simplemente porque Josh está en ella. No tiene nada que ver con lo que hubo o hay entre nosotros. ¿Verdad? Para el día martes mi mente seguía enredada y no tenía idea de que sucedería en mi futuro. Debía reunirme con Collins y Peter en el despacho de mi hermano. Luego de clases acudí a mi cita. Pulsé el botón para llamar el ascensor que inmediatamente de abrió. No había nadie en él. Cuando las puertas se cerraban una mano evito que lo hicieran haciéndolas retroceder dando paso a un invitado a quien había tratado de evitar. Empecé a jugar en mi celular con el fin de evitar su mirada. Ignorarlo sería lo mejor por ahora. - No has contestado mis llamadas – dijo Josh, pero aun no quería contestarle – Ni mis mensajes. Me da la impresión que estás evitándome. No pude evitar reír. Él podía lograr eso siempre. – No quise darte esa impresión. Cuanto lo lamento. - No hay problema – mis ojos seguían pegados a mi celular – mientras no lo vuelvas a hacer será suficiente. Y deberías dejar el sarcasmo cuando te disculpes en otra ocasión. Me obligué a mirarlo - ¿Qué quieres? - A ti. – siempre esas malditas respuestas que hacía a mi corazón saltar. - Sabes perfectamente que no me refiero a eso, Joshua. - Lo sé pero me encanta recordártelo. – Ahí estaba otra vez esa sonrisa coqueta – Además lo que más quiero en esta vida es a ti lo demás siempre será secundario. No había notado que se había acercado y había logrado acorralarme contra la pared. Sus brazos sujetando la barandilla a cada lado de mi cuerpo evitando que mi escape. - Que pena que en esta vida uno no consiga todo lo que quiere. – lo desafié con mucha dificultad. Su cercanía nublaba mi mente completamente. - Uno tiene que luchar por lo quiere. No puedes dejar todo en manos del destino. Su aliento estaba contra mis labios. Sabía que iba a besarme y sabía que como en otras ocasiones no podría resistirme. Solo la anticipación de su contacto hacía que mi pulso se acelerara. Oímos un carraspeo y nos alejamos rápidamente. Ninguno de los dos se había dado cuenta que el ascensor se había detenido y que sus puertas se habían abierto dando lugar a Peter y a Collins observándonos. La mirad de mi hermano estaba llena de incertidumbre. Le hice una pequeña señal, mientras salía del ascensor, para indicarle que luego hablaríamos. Saludé a Collins y luego los cuatro pasamos al despacho. Había llegado mi hora de decidir. Sabía que tenía que hacer lo correcto y dejar mis problemas a un lado. Pero una parte pequeña de mi conciencia me decía que Darío tenía razón y lo mejor era apartar a Josh lo más posible de nuestras vidas. El silencio fue un tanto incómodo hasta que un golpe en la puerta. Un hombre de uno 35 años diría yo entró y saludo a Collins y a Josh. - Este es Steven – dijo Josh. No debería molestarme pero recordar que este hombre tuvo mucho de la culpa en lo que ocurrió con Josh me hacía odiarle en cierta manera. – Él es Peter y esta hermosa dama es Alexandra. El tal Steven dio un recorrido por todo mi cuerpo. Me sentí incómoda bajo su inspección. – Mucho gusto – dijo besando mi mano. – Ahora entiendo porque mi representado no puede dejarte ir. - No estamos aquí para discutir asuntos personales – aseguré incómoda. No estaba segura si Collins sabía nuestra historia. Solo complicaría más las cosas. - Además de hermosa, inteligente y suspicaz. – Sí. Este tipo ya me cayó mal. – Tiene razón. Josh está decidido a estar dentro de su proyecto. Lo estudié y en verdad es muy bueno, consistente. Debo felicitarte por la idea y la forma de proceder. - Gracias – dije mirándolo fijamente. - Como dije, mi representado quiere ser parte de esto y como ven tiene todo lo que necesita. - Conozco a Josh y se lo entusiasta que es. Estoy seguro de que se entregará por completo. – dijo Collins sellando mi destino. No puedo ir en contra de mis socios. La fundación en sí lo necesita a él. - Será una trabajo duro – aseguró Peter mirando a Josh. - Lo sé. Un poco de trabajo es lo que necesitamos. - Si todo va como hasta ahora el próximo año a más tardar tendremos que iniciar con la construcción de centros médicos y tendrás que viajar para controlar su proceso. - Eso está solucionado – dijo Steven – Josh tiene proyectos en su futuro pero él estará tomando un año de descanso que puede iniciar en unos pocos meses. Como dices, si todo va como hasta ahora podemos hacer coincidir sus vacaciones con los proyectos. No tenía salida. – Entonces no tenemos más que discutir. Solo… firmar. Peter me miraba incrédulo mientras Josh le daba un apretón de mano a Collins. Hizo lo mismo con Peter y luego se acercó a mí. – Ya tienes lo que querías. - Una parte, sí. Pero aun no tengo lo más importante. - Espero que en verdad te entregues a esto. No lo hagas solo por… - dudé, no quería ser tan egocéntrica. - Lo hago por ti, sí. Pero también lo hago por es una excelente manera de ayudar. Peter, Collins y Steven analizaban los papeles que Josh debe firmar, ajenos a mi charla con Josh. – Me tengo que ir. Anuncié. Me despedí de ellos y luego le ofrecí mi mano a Josh. – Nos vemos pronto socia. Socio. ¿En qué diablos me había metido? Hooola :) lamento la tardanza... como dije estoy en exámenes y luego de dar uno fui al cine.. quería ver divergente pero con mis amigos hicimos piedra, papel o tijera y ganaron.. terminamos viendo spiderma 2..! aun no puedo ver divergente :/ La verdad es q no iba a actualizar xq no he tenido tiempo de escribir debido a los exámenes pero decidi publicar este cap xq quizás no pueda actualizar el domingo :P no es seguro, el día martes tengo el examen mas dificil y no tengo tiempo de escribir aunq tratare de hacerlo.. espero sepan disculparme x esta vez :/ ¿Q les parecio? no se xq pero me encanta cuadno escribo capítulos intensos ...!

Cuando empecé el fic no pensé que fueran mas de 50 caps exagerando pero me doy cuenta q no tengo la hablididad de las escritoras de poder resumir todos esos sentimientos y eso en una pag... ! Espero q no les aburra, pero decidí continuar hasta el final aunque ahora estoy haciendo que todo suceda mas rapido en lugar de redactar 4 caps de cada cosa. :) gracias x sus reviews y xa sigan dejandolos.. quiero saber q creen q pasará? Nos leemos luego.. lo más pronto q pueda :P .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: - Creo que ya hemos discutido antes esto. ¿Me amaste Alex? – Tenía que preguntar para que ella entendiera mi punto - ¿en verdad llegaste a amarme de la manera en que no puedes vivir sin esa persona? ¿Me amaste de la manera en la que tu corazón solo latía cuando estaba cerca y cuando estábamos separados era como ahogarse permanentemente? Pudiera decirte millones de cosa más sobre el amor verdadero y como me sentía respecto a ti. Un amor así no puede olvidarse, Alex. Tú juras que ya no me amas y que no sientes nada, por eso necesito saberlo. ¿Me amaste?[Chapter 86] Capítulo 86 Mierda. - ¿Qué haces aquí, Claudia? – mi tono sonaba grosero por lo que rápidamente añadí – Quiero decir, que no esperaba verte aquí. - Yo tampoco esperaba verte. Mi agente me dijo que sería importante presentarme en este evento. Collins ha enviado invitaciones a toda la comunidad actoral de España. Estaba en Los Ángeles así que decidí asistir. Leí un poco sobre la iniciativa de colaborar con hospitales con pocos recursos y todo y en verdad es una propuesta muy agradable. - Lo sé – mi niña es muy inteligente. - ¿Y tú que haces por aquí? ¿Qué te parece si entramos y continuamos nuestra conversación? – me ofreció su mano. Dudé en tomarla. Esperaba que mi niña aun no haya llegado. Me había encontrado con Claudia antes de ingresar al salón donde se llevaría a cabo otro evento para recaudar fondos para la fundación. Atravesamos las puertas atrayendo la mirada de gran parte de invitados. En esta ocasión no pudimos evitar la llegada de la prensa. Ayudé a Claudia a buscar su mesa que casualmente estaba en la misma que la mía. Mi puesto estaba junto a Alex, algo que debo agradecer a Collins y su asistente. El lugar de Claudia estaba frente a mi lugar, pero ella decidió sentarse a mi lado para seguir conversando conmigo. Maldita sea mi suerte. Distinguí a Peter saludar a algunos invitados. De su mano iba mi niña. Hermosa como siempre. Su vestido verde esmeralda lograba un hermoso contraste con su piel. Era un traje sencillo, por delante llegaba a su cuello donde se sostenía con un delicado nudo. Dejaba sus hombros y su espalda completamente desnuda hasta su cintura. Su falda llegaba un poco antes de sus rodillas. Su cabello recogido en un moño que dejaba escapar algunos rizos y su rostro con maquillaje muy natural a excepción de su brillo labial rojo. Me perdí en ella. Pareciera que el mundo se volvía borroso y lo único claro en mi vida era ella. Sus gestos, su sonrisa, todo era mágico. - ¿Josh? – llamó Claudia sacándome de mi ensoñación - ¿Qué sucede? - Nada. – volví mi atención a ella quien me miraba interrogante. Giró para seguir mi mirada, miró a Alex y frunció el ceño. - ¿Quién es ella? - Mi socia. – Respondí dudoso – Es la mentora de todos estos proyectos. - ¿Estás dentro de esto? – preguntó sorprendida. - Sí. Esta semana arreglé todo para ser socio. Probablemente hoy lo anuncien. - Disculpa. Creo que estás en mi lugar. – su voz me hizo estremecer. Levanté mi mirada para encontrar la de Alex muy seria. Veía a Claudia con cierto enojo. Me di cuenta que estábamos muy cerca el uno de otro. Si no supiera que mi mente buscaba signos de esperanza juraría que estaba celosa. - ¿Perdón? – respondió Claudia mirándola con desdén. - Mi lugar – apuntó al nombre sobre la mesa. Claudia giró hacia el nombre leyéndolo. Sé que el reconocimiento sobre quien era esta chica y lo que significa para mí llegó en un segundo. – Si querías traer acompañantes debiste avisar para que asignaran lugares continuos. La voz de Alex fue seca cuando se dirigió hacia mí. – Ella no… no estoy… - Mi lugar está en frente. Solo me acerqué a saludar a Josh – dijo Claudia poniéndose de pie. Las vi mirarse con desdén. Ambas lucían una postura amenazadora. No quería llenarme d e ilusiones al pensar que mi niña esta celosa, pero era obvio que Claudia no le agradaba y tenía que aligerar el ambiente. - Claudia, ella es Alexandra, mi socia, mentora de todo el proyecto. Alex, ella es Claudia. - Mucho gusto – dijeron ambas sin apartar la mirada. - ¿Qué cuentas, Josh? – Peter llegó a nuestro lugar. Se percató de la confrontación entre mis dos exnovias. – Alex, antes de que te acomodes en tu lugar quiero presentarte a unas personas. - Creo que me voy mi lugar – dijo Claudia mirándome – Espero que podamos estar solos luego, Josh. – dijo con una voz en sensual en una clara invitación a un tema para adultos. Vi a las manos de Alex apretarse en puños cuando Claudia besó mi mejilla para dirigirse a su lugar. La mesa era lo suficientemente amplia para no poder llevar una conversación de un lado al otro. - Hola – dije en un susurro a mi niña quien tenía una mirada enojada. - Hola – dijo antes de marcharse nuevamente con Peter. Estaba enfadada, de eso no había duda. Lo que me interesaba era saber el porqué. Volvió a sentarse en su lugar ignorándome completamente. Ya era hora que empezara a olvidarse de esa actitud. - ¿De nuevo vas a ignorarme? – se estremeció con mi voz pero no miró – Lo mejor será que dejes esa actitud. Vamos a pasar mucho tiempo juntos. Tratemos de llevar la fiesta en paz. - Tienes razón.- suspiró – Será mejor que discutamos lo vamos a hacer. - ¿Qué se supone que significa eso? – su tono no me gustaba. Sabía que su mente estaba maquinando algo y no me iba a gustar. - Que tenemos que buscar la manera de pasar el menos tiempo posible juntos y por el bien de todos poder soportarnos el uno al otro. - Tú eres la única que finge que no me soporta y lo del tiempo no será necesario. Somos personas adultas capaces de separar el trabajo de nuestra vida personal. Eso lo demostraste cuando me aceptaste.- sabía que yo no podría separar esas dos cosas pero ella no tenía por qué saberlo. - No lo sé, Josh. No sé qué sucederá con mi vida ahora. Dame tiempo ¿sip? Su voz mostraba derrota. Me acerqué a ella y tomé su mentón para que me mirara. – Sucederá lo que tenga que suceder, Alex. Te prometo que pondré todo mi esfuerzo en esto. - No solo es esto, Josh. Esta mi vida. Por primera vez tuve una riña con mi novio y todo es tu culpa. Por primera vez mis amigos no están de acuerdo conmigo y me ignoran. Me he convertido en una mentirosa, he traicionado a mi novio. Me sentía culpable. Podía entender lo desolada que se sentía y la verdad es que en ningún momento pensé mucho en las consecuencias que tendría. Quería decirle que todo iría bien pero la verdad ni yo sé lo que sucederá. Busqué su mano que reposaba en su regazo y diría lo que primero atravesara mi mente. Le diría que todo estaría bien porque ella siempre me tendría a mí. Velare por su bienestar y felicidad. Le daría el mundo entero si me lo pidiera. Solamente la quería de nuevo a mi lado. - Tienes que subir – dijo ella apuntando al escenario. No me había dado cuenta que Collins había hecho la presentación del evento y probablemente mi presentación ya que todos me miraban curiosos. Me paré de golpe y avancé hacia mi socio. Di un pequeño discurso lo más rápido posible para volver donde Alex. Cuando me senté a su lado no tenía nada en mi mente que pudiera decirle. Mi mirada era intensa sobre ella y de un momento a otro sus mejillas se sonrojaron. Parecíamos adolescentes. Recordaba las veces en que su piel se tornaba de aquel color, a pesar de que su tez era morena. – Nunca entenderé como puedes adquirir ese color. Ella giró su rostro molesta, como si la hubiera ofendido. Busque su mano y ella la apartó. –Alex. Ella solo me enfrentó molesta y me retó con su mirada. – Tus ojos molestos sobre mí son inquietantes. Deja de mirarme como… como si yo… - ¿Cómo si tu fueras lo único que deseo? Pues eso es exactamente lo que sucede. – anuncié - ¿Tengo ojos molestos? Bueno, déjame que me haga a un lado con mis ojos y tendré unas serias palabras con ellos acerca de su molesto y maleducado comportamiento contigo. - ¡No me hables de esa manera, Joshua! Te dije que no quiero que juegues conmigo. - Vale. No te enojes, no era mi intención que te enfades. - No estoy enojada – protestó y forzó una sonrisa en su rostro – Estoy sonriendo. - Tu sonrisa no llega a tus ojos. - Es porque no me siento cómoda y no tengo motivos para sonreír. – hice una mueca de dolor ante sus palabras, seguramente. Trate de romper la tensión y buscar una nueva forma de aliviar la situación. Las peleas constantes no ayudaban. - ¿Sabes por qué los elefantes no pueden chatear? Me miró curiosa y una media sonrisa se abrió paso en su rostro - ¿Otro de tus chistes malos? No lo sé. - Porque le tienen miedo al ratón. Era un chiste malo, pero ella no pudo evitar reír. – Fue muy malo. - Lo importante es que te reíste. – ella seguí riendo y negando con la cabeza. Estar con ella era tan fácil cuando me dejaba entrar. De pronto su risa paró y me miró fijamente. - ¿Se supone que debo cuidarme de tu novia o tú le explicaras que no hay nada entre nosotros? - ¿Eh? – no sabía de qué hablaba. - Claudia – señaló con su cabeza hacia el otro lado. – No ha dejado de apuñalarme con sus ojos. Si las miradas mataran estuviera destrozada y ella estaría bailando sobre mi cadáver. Miré a Claudia al otro lado. Está conversando con un joven quien al aparecer estaba interesado en ella pero su mirada esta fija en Alex. Ni siquiera había caído en cuenta que yo la miraba. - No somos nada… ella y yo, quiero decir. - Tu y yo tampoco. Ella piensa que tiene derecho sobre ti y que nosotros tenemos algo. Apreciaría que me libraras de su sed de venganza. Aún recuerdo a cierta exnovia tuya. Sabía que otra mueca se formó en mi rostro. Debía admitir que Alex había aprendido a usar sus palabras de forma hiriente. – Lo siento por eso. Claudia es diferente a Shannon. Puede que te odie y todo pero ella sabe que tú eres la única dueña de mi corazón. Ella sabe perder. - Eso no me reconforta, exactamente. Me sentiría más segura si le dices que lo de nosotros ya es historia. - No haré eso. - ¿Por qué no? – preguntó irritada. - Porque sería mentirle. Lo de nosotros no ha terminado. Tomo una gran bocanada de aire que soltó lentamente antes de hablar. – No puedo entenderte. Te he dicho una y mil veces que entre nosotros no puede haber nada más. ¿Por qué no comprendes eso? ¿Por qué no sigues con tu vida? Se nota que Claudia está enamorada de ti. Tú mismo dices que es una buena chica. Solo tienes que darle esa oportunidad. - Creo que ya hemos discutido antes esto. ¿Me amaste Alex? – Tenía que preguntar para que ella entendiera mi punto - ¿en verdad llegaste a amarme de la manera en que no puedes vivir sin esa persona? ¿Me amaste de la manera en la que tu corazón solo latía cuando estaba cerca y cuando estábamos separados era como ahogarse permanentemente? Pudiera decirte millones de cosa más sobre el amor verdadero y como me sentía respecto a ti. Un amor así no puede olvidarse, Alex. Tú juras que ya no me amas y que no sientes nada, por eso necesito saberlo. ¿Me amaste? Nuestras miradas conectaron y esa sensación en la que todo el mundo desaparece regresó. No había contestado a mi pregunta pero no era necesario porque yo sabía la verdad. Ella me había amado y en alguna parte de su corazón, esos sentimientos permanecían guardados. Quería leer su alma a través de sus ojos, quería sentir su calor a través de sus labios. Su mirada iba de mis ojos a mis labios mostrándome que ella pensaba en lo mismo. – Es hora de tu acto. La voz de Peter llamó la atención de mi niña reventando nuestra burbuja. Ella se puso de pie y me miró: - Necesitas una respuesta y te la daré. Luego subió al escenario. La velada estaba siendo animada por una banda musical que al parecer iba a tocar para mi niña. La música empezó. Me concentré en ella y la vi cantar al público sin siquiera mirarme. (El primer día del resto de mi vida – La Oreja de Van Gogh: www_youtube_com/watch?v=nx75SH02Vcw ) Era sin duda una profesional cantando. Se movía y cantaba perfectamente. Me miró luego de un instante, para ser exacto, luego de un estribillo. Se enfocó en mí y supe que me daría su respuesta. Pero te quise como a nada más, como al respirar, te quise como el fuego al viento en una noche de San Juan. Y ahora que me voy me das la luna sobre el mar, ahora que no hay más destino que el camino en soledad. Ya queda poco por decir, y poco para recordar, que llora el río cuando pasa porque nunca volverá. Ahora tenía mi respuesta salida de sus propios labios. Se bajó del pequeño escenario y se encontró con Peter con quien empezó a charlar, obviamente tratando de evitarme. Iba a ir tras ella porque ahora me debía muchas más explicaciones. Me amó y como yo le dije, ese tipo de amor no termina. Hooola :) se que dije q no actualizaré hoy pero lo hice, pero no prometo mucho el miércoles, de ahí podré seguir publicando normalmente, incluso mi horario de clases cambiará y esta un poco más cómodo.. ¿Q les pareció? en verdad quiero saber q piensan y q creen q sucederá... me odiarán estos caps xq todo solo se complicará pero ya vendran tiempo diferentes :P Sobretodo en el próximo cap :/ ¿La canción? un amigo me traumó conella y me pareció ponerla, fue algo de último momento. Gracias x sus reviews y xfa sigan dejandolos :) PD: Blaralu, aunque atrasado espero q hayas tenido una lindo cumple :) me di cuenta q cumples el mismo día q Katniss :P Nos leemos luego :) .-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: - No pensé que volverías con él – giré para encontrarme con Claudia – Muy buena estrategia el dejarlo sufrir por un par de años para aceptarlo de vuelva. Corriste con suerte que él no se enamorara de alguien más. - No fue ninguna estrategia y no estamos juntos. – traté de que mi voz sea suave. - Pues deberías aclarárselo a él. Te mira como si fueras de su propiedad.[Chapter 87] Capítulo 87 Había sido una estúpida dedicándole aquella canción. Me había dejado llevar por el momento. Ahora le había dado los suficientes motivos para seguir con su lucha. Tendría que buscar la manera de que entienda que a pesar de lo grande que fue mi amor por él, había terminado. - Alex ¿podemos hablar? – Josh había llegado hasta donde estaba con Peter. - No creo que sea el momento. Collins iniciará la subasta – señaló mi hermano. - ¿Subasta? – preguntó Josh. - De chicas, para bailar. No me mires así Hutcherson, es una forma divertida de recolectar donativos.- dije cuando Josh frunció el ceño. - ¿No vas a participar, verdad? - Claro que lo haré. Las reglas solo dicen chicas solteras no hay ningún otro requisito. Me tomó del brazo - No estás haciendo esto. - No te estoy pidiendo permiso. – retiré mi brazo bruscamente y me dirigí a la fila de chicas que se apuntaron para participar. Debía admitir que las celebridades eran entusiastas. - No pensé que volverías con él – giré para encontrarme con Claudia – Muy buena estrategia el dejarlo sufrir por un par de años para aceptarlo de vuelva. Corriste con suerte que él no se enamorara de alguien más. - No fue ninguna estrategia y no estamos juntos. – traté de que mi voz sea suave. - Pues deberías aclarárselo a él. Te mira como si fueras de su propiedad. - Él sabe que no hay nada entre nosotros. Tengo un novio y una vida en la que Josh no participa. - Espero que sea cierto porque lo quiero para mí. Pienso hacer todo lo posible por tenerlo y preferiría que no interfieras. – quería que mi puño conecté en su cara bonita. - Todo tuyo. Si quieres te lo envuelvo para llevar. - Odio el sarcasmo, Alexandra. - Y me odias porque Josh me ama, Claudia. No sé qué me impulsó a decir esto pero esa bruja me volvía loca. Era mi turno para la subasta. - Aquí tenemos a esta hermosa dama. Tengo el gusto que sea mi socia, les diré que es una chica muy divertida y muy inteligente, además de guapísima. – me presentó Collins y muchos chicos chiflaron – Como hicimos con las otras chicas, empezaremos con 5 mil dólares para quiénes quieres obtener un baile con ella está velada. - 10 mil dólares – gritó un joven unas mesas más atrás de la mía. Recuerdo que Peter me lo presentó pero no recuerdo su nombre. - 15 mil – dijo Peter que me guiño un ojo. - 20 mil – volvió a gritar aquel extraño chico. - 25 mil – dijo otro invitado. Era un joven que aparentaba unos 28 años. Creo haberlo visto en televisión pero no recuerdo precisamente en qué programa. - Creo que hemos roto algún tipo de record – dijo Collins – 25 mil a la una, 25 mil a las dos… - 50 mil dólares – dijo Josh. Muchas personas se sorprendieron por tan generosa donación, yo sabía que lo hacía por otras razones. - 60 mil dólares – anunció Peter. Debió ver mi mirada torturada. - 100 mil dólares – gritó Josh. Todos disfrutaban de la disputa. Le hice una señal a Peter para que abandonara la disputa. No tenía caso seguir sabiendo que Josh no daría su brazo a torcer. - 100 mil dólares a la una, 100 mil dólares a las dos, 100 mil dólares a las… - VENDIDO – anunció Josh provocando risas de los invitados. Ignoré su mirada y me situé junto a las demás chicas que ya habían sido subastadas. Me alejé lo mayormente posible de Claudia que me miraba furiosa desde otro extremo. Collins anunció el baile y las parejas formadas en la subasta empezaron a justarse. Josh estuvo a mi lado en un abrir y cerrar de ojos ofreciéndome su mano. En cuanto nuestros dedos se tocaron mi cuerpo se estremeció por lo que intenté retroceder pero Josh me sujetó y me atrajo a su cuerpo antes de tener la oportunidad de alejarme. Su mano en mi cintura hacía que me estremeciera. Podía saborear aquella sensación de calidez que llenaba todo mi cuerpo cuando me tocaba. Estaba viviendo de recuerdos. Cada vez que lo tenía cerca lo único que hacía era rememorar sus besos, el olor de su piel y las veces que me había dicho que me amaba. Mi cuerpo anhelaba tanto su contacto y este tipo de cercanía pero mie mente disputaba entre lo bien que se sentía mi cuerpo y lo mal que estaba haciéndole esto a mi vida. Josh me atrajo más cerca de él, haciendo que sea inevitable mirarlo a los ojos. Si giraba mi cabeza para evitar su mirada, lo único que lograría seria rozar sus labios. Mi mente corría de aquí para allá, de posibilidad en posibilidad, pero en todas ellas me encontraba con la misma pared. Podía dejarme llevar por esto y darle una oportunidad a lo que tenemos. Aunque me cueste admitirlo entre nosotros había… mucho. Pero dar ese paso sería darle la razón. Arriesgarme a algo incierto y todo este tiempo me había refugiado en la seguridad que mi novio me ofrecía. Y había sido feliz. ¿Cómo renunciar a eso? ¿Cómo puedo dejar ir todo lo que tenía por algo que no me garantizaba nada? Eso era. No podía hacerlo. Tenía que terminar las cosas entre Josh y yo para siempre. - Tu perfume me vuelve loco. – Susurró en mi oído – Tu piel me atrae, me hace querer tocarla y querer besarla. - No podemos seguir haciendo esto. – dije en un susurro. La lenta música nos envolvía. - No, no podemos. Pero tú te resistes y mientras lo hagas no podemos hacer nada más. - No podemos seguir jugando. Estoy haciendo daño a muchas personas con esto. Josh me miró y me llevó lejos de la pista hacia el jardín posterior que caracterizaba a los hoteles de Collins. Cuando dejamos atrás la música nos detuvimos para hablar. - Me he convertido en alguien que no soy desde que regresaste. Gasto mis energías en evitarte, en insultarte y hacerte entender que esto no es posible. He mentido a muchas personas, he jugado con la confianza de personas a quienes quiero. He traicionado a mi novio. Lo he engañado. ¿Desde cuándo soy ese tipo de persona? Pude verlo reflexionar y por sus ojos pasó una oleada de dolor. No espere que me besara pero de un momento a otro sus labios estaban sobre los míos en busca de hacerme retroceder. Era demandante y apasionado. No pude resistirme y me dejé arrastrar por la intensidad del momento. De algún lado el recuerdo de mi novio llegó llenándome de culpabilidad. Pude detener el beso pero no pude evitar que Josh continúe abrazándome. - Te amo tanto, Alex. - No hagas esto. Yo no puedo amarte de la misma manera. Debes entenderlo porque está haciéndonos daños a ambos y estamos arrastrando a más personas en ello. Se apartó de mí tan rápido que la pérdida de su contacto casi fue dolorosa. – No puedes estar hablando en serio, Alexandra. - Lo hago. Lo nuestro terminó hace mucho y es lo que debes entender. Te amé. Con todo mi corazón, como nunca he amado a alguien. Ahora amo a alguien más y necesito que me dejes ir para poder ser feliz. - ¿Y yo qué? – pregunto con su voz llena de dolor. - Si no me dejas ir no podrás ser feliz. - Tú eres mi felicidad – gritó exasperado. - Pero tú no eres la mía. – aseguré. Mi corazón se rompía en pedacitos con mis palabras. – El amor no puede ser egoísta. - No soy egoísta, Alexandra. Te amo y quiero que seas feliz. - Entonces demuéstrame lo mucho que me amas y déjame continuar con mi vida. – Me acerqué a él y tomé su rostro para que me mirara - Déjame ser feliz con la persona que en verdad quiero a mi lado. Sus ojos se llenaron de dolor y sabía que lo estaba rompiendo. Mi corazón se hizo chiquito pero había tomado la decisión y él tenía que entenderlo. Sus labios besaron los míos una vez más antes de que se alejara corriendo y desapareciera de mi vista. No debería pero dolía verlo irse. De alguna manera Josh Hutcherson había vuelto a romper mi corazón. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O No entiendo nada. ¿Qué más puedo hacer que no haya hecho más? ¿Me quieres? ¿No? ¿Entonces xq nos haces esto? No sé qué más hacer para recuperarte, no sé qué más decir para que me quieras de regreso. (Responde – Diego Gonzalez: www_youtube_com/watch?v=d_TJ4B1HAaE ) O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O El estridente sonido de mi celular me despertó. - ¿Hola? – murmuré adormilada. - ¿Esperas que no desconfíe de ti? – la voz de Darío era furiosa. - ¿De qué hablas ahora? - Mierda – gritó exasperado. Muy pocas veces usaba ese tipo de lenguaje por lo que definitivamente me asusté – Enciende el televisor. Canal 43. Alcancé el control que estaba en mi mesita e hice lo que me pidió. Ahí estaba un maldito programa de farándula mostrando fotos mías y de Josh de la velada pasada. Hablaban de nuestra reconciliación y de la hermosa pareja que hacemos. Confirmaron que el proyecto de la fundación había sido mi idea y mi buen novio estaba apoyándome. Maldita sea. - No es lo que piensas, Darío. - Ya no sé qué pensar – dijo con la voz más calmada. - Acepté a Josh en el proyecto. Y Sí, tendré que verlo, pero le he dejado claro las cosas. - ¿Qué más da que le digas que lo quieres lejos si le permites estar cerca? - No puedo esconderme y evitarlo por siempre. No puedo dejar que mi vida terminé o inicié porque él está cerca. No voy a irme con él. No lo amo. Deje de hacerlo hace mucho. Eres el único que no entiende esto. - ¿Y se supone que tengo que aceptar que este cerca de ti? No confío en él. - Pues tienes que confiar en mí. Si en verdad me amas y si en verdad debemos estar juntos nada podrá separarnos. ¿En verdad crees que volvería con Josh? mejor dicho ¿confías en mí? Si era sincera él no debería confiar en mí. Lo había engañado después de todo. Pero necesitaba saber que él lo hacía y que podíamos luchas contra lo que fuera porque yo no iba a dejarlo si él no me apartaba. Pero no dijo nada. La línea solo era llenada por el silencio respondiendo mi pregunto. - Es todo lo que necesitaba saber. Corté la llamada y él no intento volver a llamar. Tal vez este si era el fin de nuestra historia. HooolA..! no quise dejarles sin cap y aunq es cortito tendran q conformarse xq no he escrito mas :/ Tengo q correr asi q solo espero sus reviews como siempre y se q me odian.. lo lamento pero creanme q pronto cambiara la situación :) ¡q creen q sucedera? quiero saber sus predicciones Nos vemos el domingo Nos leemos luego .-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE Alex se merecía lo mejor y posiblemente lo tenía. Siempre supe que no la merecía pero tenía la esperanza de algún día llegar a ser lo que ella necesitaba. Estaba dispuesto a dar todo por ella. Eso debería ser suficiente. Pero no lo era.[Chapter 88] Capítulo 88 Me sentía… vacío. Esa era la palabra. Sentía que mi vida no tenía sentido, carecía de luz y color. Volvía a ser monótona. Volvía a vivir porque tenía no porque tuviera una motivación. ¿En verdad había perdido? ¿En verdad ella no me amaba? ¿Cómo puede eso ser posible? ¿Cómo puede acabarse así algo tan hermoso? ¿Por qué ella puede dejar de amarme y yo no? ¿En verdad era eso posible o simplemente no quiere lidiar con lo que tenemos? Es la única explicación. Ella no quiere aceptar lo que siente y pretende refugiarse en lo que tiene. Nadie puede olvidarse de un amor tan grande. Ni siquiera ella. Ha pasado casi una semana desde que me alejé de ella con el corazón destrozado ante sus palabras. Mi cabeza solo ha dado vuelcos y recorridos en laberintos para tratar de entender lo que en verdad sucede. Ella me pidió que renuncié a ella pero como hacerlo si ella es lo único por lo que en verdad vivo. Solo su cercanía, su voz, una pequeña mirada es suficiente para que cada célula de mi cuerpo se sienta viva y satisfecha ¿cómo renunciar a eso? No puedo. La buscaré, la besaré y le ofreceré el mundo. Tendrá que repetirme esas palabras, mirarme a los ojos y decirme que no me ama y que lo prefiere a él sobre mí. Esperaba que terminara su turno para confrontarla. Me coloqué junto a la ventana de la cafetería que se encontraba frente al hospital. Parecía que el tiempo no pasaba con la suficiente rapidez. La ansiedad me invadía y ya no podía esperar más. Estaba dispuesto a fingir desmayarme con tal de poder buscarla. Me puse de pie y antes de poder atravesar la calle lo vi. Estaba apoyado en un poste a un lado de la salida de principal. Llevaba un ramo de rosas y un gigante oso de peluche que tenía amarrado a su pata un globo en forma de corazón con la inscripción: \" Lo Siento, Te amo \". Me quedé congelado ante la escena. Vi a ella salir del hospital con su uniforme y su cartera. Se sorprendió al verlo ahí parado esperando. Darío sonrío y ella devolvió la sonrisa. Sus ojos se iluminaron cuando se acercó a él. Darío dejó en el suelo las rosas y el peluche para poder recibirla en sus brazos. Sus labios se encontraron en un profundo beso. Alcancé escuchar las palabras \"Lo siento\", \"yo también\", \"Soy un tonto\" y… \"te amo\". Dolía presenciar toda la escena. Me sentía un intruso en aquel cuadro. Ellos se querían, se necesitaban el uno al otro y yo solo había llegado para tratar de desaparecer eso. Las mismas preguntas volvía a revolotear en mi cabeza ¿Por qué ella podía dejar de amarme y yo no? Tal vez era porque ella tenía a la persona correcta. No puedo negar que Darío es una gran persona, es guapo, inteligente, luchador. La ama y estaría dispuesto a todo por ella. ¿Por qué no enamorarse de alguien como él? Ahí tenía mi respuesta. Los vi alejarse tomados de la mano y sumergidos en un plática feliz. Me dolía el corazón. Alex se merecía lo mejor y posiblemente lo tenía. Siempre supe que no la merecía pero tenía la esperanza de algún día llegar a ser lo que ella necesitaba. Estaba dispuesto a dar todo por ella. Eso debería ser suficiente. Pero no lo era. Tenía razón. Debía dejar ese egoísmo y permitirle ser feliz. Si Darío era lo que ella necesitaba para eso pues ella lo tendría. Aunque solo pensar en renunciar a ella me estaba matando. Era egoísta. Mucho. Pero tenía que dejarla ser feliz porque yo la amaba y quería que fuera así. No había insistido en buscarla, ni en hablar con ella. Solo buscaba la manera de aceptar esta realidad y encontrar la solución para no salir más herido aun. \"Moriría por ti. Por ti movería cielo y tierra si pudiera. Cuanto daría por tenerte a mi lado, Sin ti me sentiría acabado. Ya la han visto por ahí... Siempre tan distante e intocable como siempre. Eres el cielo y el infierno de mis sueños. Y te he soñado tantas veces. - /3 - No podría estar sin ella, Me moriría del dolor... No podría soportarlo, Cuando no siento su calor... (Nubes Negras – Los de Adentro: www_youtube_com/watch?v=SUZwz7NBl_8 ) \" Quería que aquella letra llegara a ella y aunque daba mucho de qué hablar a la prensa, no importaba. Los días habían pasado y sabía que de alguna manera tendría que enfrentarla tarde o temprano. Era sábado. Solo había pasado una semana pero sentía como que había transcurrido años. Hoy era su día libre. Una corazonada me dijo dónde encontrarla y afortunadamente acerté cuando la vi sentada sobre un pequeño tronco junto al lago del gran parque frente a su departamento. El sendero para llegar ahí no era muy transcurrido. Fue el mismo lugar donde se había desmayado. Pequeña testaruda. No había aprendido la lección. No debería alejarse de la civilización, algo podría pasarle. Veía su espalda pero percibía el sonido de su voz y de su guitarra. (Last Kiss – Taylor Swift: www_youtube_com/watch?v=w037zxiBTOM ) Me detuve a escuchar cada palabra que salía de su boca y parte de mí quería creer que aquel recuerdo del que hablaba… aquel último beso. Pero tenía que aceptar que la realidad no era así. Espere hasta que terminara de cantar para acercarme. Debió escuchar mis pasos porque giró hacia mí. Nuestras miradas se encontraron y por primera vez no obtuve un saludo grosero de su parte. - Hola – fue un pequeño susurro. - Hola – respondía llegando a ella y sentándome a su lado. Ambos teníamos nuestras miradas en el agua del lago. El viento corría y formaba pequeñas ondas en la superficie. - ¿Cómo estás? – preguntó luego de un rato. Giré para mirarla y ella me dedicó una pequeña sonrisa. - Bien. Creo. – respondí con sinceridad. - Josh… no quiero hacerte daño. Lamento mucho lo que está sucediendo y no sé qué hacer para remediarlo. - ¿Puedes amarme? O aún mejor ¿puedes retroceder el tiempo a cuando estábamos juntos y éramos lo único que anhelábamos del mundo? - No puedo – susurró. Volví a mirar el agua. Había venido por una razón. Necesitaba que sea feliz y de alguna forma no perderla por completo. - ¿Puedes ser mi amiga?- pregunté finalmente – Quiero que seas feliz, Alex. En verdad. Me he portado cómo un canalla por mi egoísmo. No pretendo que me entiendas pero espero que me perdones. No pienso interferir más en tus sentimientos pero… pero quiero estar en tu vida. - ¿Crees que eso estaría bien? – preguntó. Se puso de pie y avanzo a la orilla. Tomo una piedrecitas y empezó a lanzarlas tratando de hacer que den brincos sobre la superficie. La seguí. - No estoy seguro. Pero es lo que necesito. – fui sincero. Sabía que su cercanía me haría daño, pero no mucho más que su ausencia. – Fuimos amigos antes de ser algo más. Quiero eso. Quiero recuperar una parte de lo que perdí. - Tienes razón… Amigo. Me acerqué a ella y la envolví en un gran abrazo. Al inicio se tensó pero luego se relajó y envolvió sus brazos alrededor de mi cintura. Sabía que había hecho lo correcto. Podía verla con otro pero no soportaría perderla completamente. Cuando nos separamos nuestras miradas conectaron. Era de esos momentos en los que tenías que besar a alguien. Era inevitable. Y estuve a punto de hacerlo pero tuve que retenerme. Suspiré y dije – Esto será difícil. Ella asintió – Lo será. Pero podemos trabajar en ello. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - Deja de mirarme, Josh. - Disfruto mirarte sonrojada – dijo aún sin dejar de mirarme lo que obviamente me hizo continuar sonrojada. - Detente. Siento mis mejillas arder. - ¿Solo por qué te estoy mirando? – pregunto coqueto acercándose a mí. - Tus ojos son molestos y no puedo concentrarme cuando me miras de esa manera. - No puedo evitarlo. Eres fascinante cuando te concentras. Frunces el ceño y tus labios cuando algo no está como te gustaría. Mi sonrisa se esfumo. – No deberías decirme esas cosas. - Lo siento – dijo entendiendo mi punto – Somos amigos y no debo hacer comentarios incómodos. - No hay problema. Ahora más nos vale terminar esto. Tengo hambre. - Pues llegó tu salvación. – la voz de mi novio nos sorprendió a ambos. Se acercó y me saludo con un beso, que intenté que fuera breve pero fallé totalmente. A pesar de que Darío no soportaba a Josh terminó aceptando su presencia y nuestra \"amistad\". Josh se había comprometido a no interferir en nuestra relación y hacer lo posible para recuperar nuestra amistad. Nos costó mucho pero creo que vamos en buen camino. Incluso mi novio se ha relajado con él, aunque no son los mejores amigos, se tratan con respeto y a excepción de esas ocasiones en las que se comporta como el hombre de las cavernas marcando su territorio todo entre ellos es tranquilo. Al inicio todo era realmente extraño. Ambos teníamos miedo de ponernos en situaciones incómodas y muchas veces nos rodeábamos de silencios incómodos. Luego de un par de meses hemos superado esa etapa y a pesar de que aún existen esos momentos en los que sus comentarios están fuera de lugar en lo que conlleva una amistad, los superamos fácilmente. - Josh – dijo mi novio con un asentimiento que Josh aceptó y lo regresó. - ¿Cómo ha estado tu día? – pregunté. - Clases. Nada nuevo. ¿Cómo va su trabajo? - Nos encanta ejecutar los proyectos. El problema es la bendita planificación. – respondió Josh. - Quisiera saltarme este paso. Odio hacer informes y odio detallar cada cosa – dije haciendo un puchero. - Más te vale terminar pronto porque quiero invitarte al cine. – dijo mi novio besando mi frente – Les traje unos sándwiches. Me imaginé que no han almorzado. - Te adoro – le sonreí mientras el sacaba nuestra comida. Aunque trate de ignorarlo, noté la mueca de dolor de Josh cuando pronuncié esas palabras. - Debo alimentar a mi princesa. Me tengo que ir a clases. Nos vemos en la noche – dijo besándome – Nos vemos Josh. Una vez que se cerró la puerta me encontré con un Josh con una gran sonrisa fingida. - Incómodo ¿eh? - Es un buen chico. Entiendo porque lo amas. Silencio incómodo que fue interrumpido por mi teléfono sonando. Contesté y empecé una rápida pero alegre charla con mi madre. Me contó todas las nuevas de la familia, sobre el trabajo y me dijo lo mucho que me extraña. No pude evitar que una lágrima se derramara. A pesar de que mi vida era buena, los extrañaba montón. - Te llamo el domingo mami. Te quiero mucho. - Yo igual pequeña – dijo antes de cortar la llamada. - Creo que nunca terminaremos si seguimos así – le dije a Josh que leía el informe pero su rostro reflejaba una sombra de tristeza. Me acerqué a su asiento y me incliné a su lado tratando de llamar su atención - ¿Qué pasa Josh? Se negó a mirarme por lo que tuve que tomar su mentón para que me mire a los ojos. – Sabes que puedes confiar en mí. ¿Qué sucede? - No quiero llenarte de mis problemas – aseguró tristemente. - No digas eso. Soy tu amiga, estoy aquí para lo que necesites. - Amiga – repitió como si tratara de convencerse. – Tus padres te quieren mucho y se quieren mucho entre sí. Me di cuenta lo que ocurría en su corazón. Tal vez Josh era un hombre independiente, peor por dentro aún era un niño, un niño que le dolía la situación de sus padres, un niño que extrañaba a su familia unida. - ¿Cómo lo llevan tus padres? - Bien. – suspiró y se puso de pie – Pasan tiempo juntos, no pelean, son buenos amigos. Mi papá aun pasa con nosotros navidad y año nuevo y es… lindo. Esos momentos hacen que me olvide de la triste realidad. Mi corazón se hizo chiquito cuando vi sus ojos cristalizarse. Me senté en el sofá y le ofrecí mi mano a Josh. Dudó pero la tomó. Ambos nos estremecimos por el contacto pero no nos soltamos. Tiré de él para que se siente junto a mí. Lo hizo y luego me abrazó. Él necesitaba ese abrazo y al parecer yo también. Me sentía tan segura, tan cálida entre sus brazos. – Tus padres te quieren Josh y yo sé que les duele haberse separado, pero aunque cuesta aceptarlo, la distancia es lo mejor en muchos casos. - Lo sé – susurró. Su mentón que se hallaba en mi hombro se movió y sentí su nariz en mi cuello. Millones de sensaciones explotaron en mi cuerpo cuando su cálido aliento acariciaba la piel sensible de mi cuello. Sus dedos recorrían mi espalda haciendo más consciente de su contacto. Sus labios rozaron mi cuello y no pude evitar gemir. Ante esto Josh empezó a besar mi cuello y subió hasta mi oreja dejando todo un trayecto de besos en su camino. Quise dejarme llevar por esas sensaciones pero en el fondo sabía que estaba mal. - Josh – susurré su nombre. Al parecer lo hizo reaccionar porque inmediatamente volvió a abrazarme. - Lo siento mucho. No quería dejarme llevar… - se disculpó – Solo… cuando estoy contigo se siente… tan bien, Alex. Es como estar en un lugar cálido y seguro donde todo está y estará bien. Se siente como estar en mi hogar. - No hay problema… amigo – creo que escupí la última palabra. No sé a quién trataba de convencer repitiéndola una y otra vez. Lo entendía. Cuando estaba con él me sentía de la misma manera. - Te quiero… mucho. - Yo también, Josh. Te quiero. Hooooola :) perdon la tardanza.. se q siempre tengo una excusa pero les cuento que estoy de viaje y no conseguí internet el día de ayer :) No puedo quedarme mucho tiempo asi que espero en verdad q me digan q piensan.. q creen q sucederá? No me odien x complicarlo todo.. lo siento mucho..! Gracias x sus reviews y Mensajes.. sigan dejandolos.. son importantes para mí :P Nos leemos lugo .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: No me dirigió la mirada en ningún momento. Se sentó frente al ordenador y se concentró en lo que la pantalla le mostraba. - ¿Y estas molesta por…? - No estoy molesta. - No es lo que parece. - ¿Tengo alguna razón para estarlo? - Bueno no… eso creo.- dije dudando. No sabía lo que le molestaba en realidad. Esta mañana se veía tan cálida. - Ahí tienes tu respuesta. No estoy molesta.[Chapter 89] Capítulo 89 Odiaba tanto a la feliz parejita. Bueno, no los odiaba en sí. Odiaba esos momentos en que se perdían el uno al otro y se olvidaban de que yo estaba ahí. Se olvidaban de que no era un espectador más. Era el chico que aún amaba con todo el alma a esta chica de la que intentaba ser solo un amigo. Los vi darse su último beso de despedida antes de separarse. Alex entró en el edificio y me apresuré a seguirla. Llegue justo para entrar juntos en el ascensor. - Hola – me saludó y por un momento mi corazón se detuvo a notar su cálida sonrisa. Quería malditamente ser la razón de toda su felicidad pero tenía que aceptar que no era de esa manera. - Hey – saludé de regreso. - ¿Por qué tan serio? – preguntó. De alguna manera su rostro curioso había adquirido un temple adorable. ¡Porque mi corazón sigue loco por ti! ¡Porque me destroza verte con otro! ¡Porque quiero tan desesperadamente dejarte de amar! – No estoy serio. - Vale. Si no quieres contarme no tienes por qué hacerlo. – sabía que estaba cabreada. Pero no podía decirle lo que en verdad sentía ya que eso solo complicaría nuestra relación que aunque sentía que no era suficiente estaba feliz por tenerla. Me mataba verla con otro pero era mejor que perderla por completo. La puerta del ascensor se abrió y ella salió hecha una furia de ahí. Fui tras ella a nuestra oficina, donde trabajamos armando todos nuestros proyectos y propuestas. Había empezado a denominar este lugar como nuestro. Alex había atravesado la puerta y se detuvo tan a prisa que prácticamente choqué con ella. La sujete por la cintura antes de que golpeé con el piso. - ¿Qué sucede? - pregunté. Tenía su mirada fija y seguí su dirección para encontrarme con la persona que había decidido sorprenderme. - Hola, Josh. Siento presentarme de sorpresa pero quería verte. Tu secretaria me dejó pasar para esperarte. - Claudia – saludé sorprendido. Alex aún la miraba fijamente sin pronunciar palabra alguna. Claudia la estaba ignorando deliberadamente. - Sé que nos veremos está noche pero no puedo esperar a contarte las buenas nuevas. – caminó hacia mí esquivando a Alex y lanzándose hacia mí en un abrazo que me vi forzado a responder. Mi niña solo nos miró y se apresuró a salir de nuestra oficina. Quería tanto seguirla y decirle que Claudia no significaba nada para mí. No como ella. Pero no tenía caso complicar las cosas. - Bueno. Dime cuál es la buena nueva. – le dije a Claudia invitándola a sentarse en el sofá. - Me aceptaron Josh. Me dieron el papel. - Eso es fantástico – no pude evitar sentirme alegre por su logró. - Me mudaré a Los Ángeles la próxima semana. Estaremos tan cerca, Josh. La ilusión de su voz me hizo sentir de una forma que no comprendía. Parte de mí quería amar a una persona como ella, que está dispuesta a hacer todo por mí, pero al mismo tiempo sabía que no podía obligarme a sentir o dejar de sentir algo por una persona. Eso solo venía con el tiempo. - En verdad estoy feliz por ti, Claudia. Tenía razón cuando te dije que tu oportunidad llegaría cuando menos lo esperas. - No sé qué haría sin ti. Probablemente me hubiera vuelto loca – dijo abrazándome una vez más –Me voy para no quitarte más tiempo. Quiero estar perfecta para ti esta noche. Necesito festejar esto y tú eres la única persona con la que quiero celebrarlo. No me dio tiempo de responder porque besó mi mejilla y salió por la puerta. Ni siquiera me dio tiempo de analizar las palabras cuando Alex regresó a nuestra oficina. No me dirigió la mirada en ningún momento. Se sentó frente al ordenador y se concentró en lo que la pantalla le mostraba. - ¿Y estas molesta por…? - No estoy molesta. - No es lo que parece. - ¿Tengo alguna razón para estarlo? - Bueno no… eso creo.- dije dudando. No sabía lo que le molestaba en realidad. Esta mañana se veía tan cálida. - Ahí tienes tu respuesta. No estoy molesta. – el tono de su voz me indicó que guardara silencio. Trabajamos en silencio durante el resto de la mañana. Para el almuerzo ella pidió que le trajeran un sándwich de la cafetería y continuó trabajando. El ambiente era tenso que se podía cortar el aire con un cuchillo. Casi era la hora de irnos pero quería hacerlo dejándola enfadada. – Lo siento. - ¿Por qué? – preguntó aun mirando la pantalla. - En realidad no estoy seguro. Si quisieras explicármelo me harías un gran favor. Pero no quiero que estemos enojados. No soporto esa tensión entre nosotros. - No tienes nada de que disculparte. Yo solo… - se detuvo antes de terminar su frase y mi mente enamorada llenó los espacios dejados con millón de escenas donde ella me decía lo celosa que estaba de pensar en mí y Claudia. - ¿Tu solo…? – insistí. Ella negó su cabeza. - Solo tengo un mal día. Lo siento si te hice sentir incómodo. Si quieres irte hazlo. Me parece que tienes una cita. – su tono sonó duro aunque estaba seguro de que ella no quería que sonara de esa manera. - La tengo. - Ella no me agrada pero no soy quien decide. – soltó sin más. Su comentario me hirió y al mismo tiempo me enfureció.- Tienes razón. Tú no decides. - Debo estarle juzgando mal. Ella debe ser increíble para que tú decidas pasar tu tiempo con ella. Ninguna chica ha logrado tu atención por toda una semana. No puedo creer que ella haya estado tan pendiente de mí que notará que toda la semana había salido con Claudia y mucho menos que supiera de mis absurdas y fallidas citas con otras chicas. - Ella… es especial. -¿Estás enamorado de ella?- preguntó directamente. -¿De quién? – pregunté para evadir el tema. Porque con ella siempre era sincero y si respondía tendría que decirle que la única persona a quien amo es a ella. - De ella. - Tu mismo has dicho que he salido con muchas chicas. Especifica quien. – solo necesitaba más tiempo para idear una forma de salirme de esta incómoda conversación. - Claudia, ¿lo estás? -¿Estoy qué?- -¡No me des vueltas! ¿Estás enamorado de Claudia Traisac? -No- porque mi corazón es tuyo. Tuve que morderme la lengua para evitar que las palabras salieran. -No suenas muy convencido. -Es difícil comprender. -Haber si entendí, ¿No estas convencido de estar enamorado, o no estás convencido de no estar enamorado? -Creo que no estoy seguro de lo que siento. -¿Por qué no lo estás? -¿Enamorado o convencido? – pregunté. -Da lo mismo. – dijo irritada. Levanté mis manos en señal de rendición. - Me voy – dijo después de un momento. - ¿Estás celosa? – pregunté antes de que atravesara la puerta. - No tengo porque estarlo. - No entiendo tu actitud, entonces. -Solo estoy siendo una buena amiga y preocupándome por ti. Pero si te sientes mejor no volveré a opinar sobre tu vida. -Tu opinión es importante para mí, Alex. No sé qué me impulsó pero mis labios se estamparon con los de ella. Me aleje a la misma velocidad con la que me había acercado. Ella respiraba pesadamente sin apartar su mirada furiosa de mí. Su rostro adquirió un tono morado. —Vamos, respira Alexandra. Apretó los puños con fuerza y explotó — ESTOY RESPIRANDO. —Pues no lo parece. Tu tono morado lo delata ¿Por qué estás tan alterada? Estaba siendo absurdo pero no tenía idea de cómo salvar la situación. —Me besaste. —Sí. Lamento eso pero no pude evitarlo. - No puedes seguir haciendo eso. Somos amigos. Los amigos no se besan y mucho menos si tienen parejas a quienes les deben respeto. - No lo sabrán. Solo fue un momento de debilidad. No hagas drama de esto. Solo olvídalo. Me miró detenidamente antes de hablar - A veces pienso que tu madre no te quería y te dejo caer más de una vez, idiota. La vi partir sin poder evitarlo. Mi mente me recordaba que tenía que haber salvado la situación no empeorarlo. En fin… mañana sería otro día. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - ¿Sigues enfada? – preguntó Josh mientras se acomodaba a mi lado en el asiento del avión. - No estoy enfadada. – lo reté con la mirada provocando una gran sonrisa en su rostro. - Lo estás y no entiendo por qué – dijo - ¿Es por Claudia? - ¿Por qué sigues insistiendo con eso? - Porque te enoja todo lo que se relaciona con ella. Y cuando me besó hoy… - Ni me recuerdes ese beso – dije en un susurro. No entiendo que me sucede pero no soporto que esa… chica este cerca de Josh. Esa bruja lo besó solo para provocarme. Se dio el lujo de venir a despedirlo en el aeropuerto y de restregarme en mi cara que había pasado la noche con Josh. - No entiendo porque te enojas, la única razón que encuentro es que estés celosa, lo que no tiene sentido. - Ella no me agrada. - Ya lo dijiste – nos ajustamos nuestros cinturones para que el avión despegue – Sinceramente espero que llegues a conocerla. Es una chica muy especial y la veras mucho a mi alrededor. - ¿Así que oficialmente es tu novia? – la idea me molesta demasiado. - Aun no lo hacemos oficial, pero pronto… - ¿Qué te detiene? - ¿La verdad? – preguntó escéptico – Ni yo sé lo que me detiene. Ella… es linda y me quiere y yo a ella pero no de la misma manera. - Si no la quieres porque estar con ella. - Has escuchado el dicho: \"Si no puedes estar con la persona a la que amas… - Ama a la persona con la que estás – terminé la frase por él. La idea de Josh amando a otra persona me resultaba… impensable. Y no debería ser de esa manera. - Anoche… ella solo durmió en mi departamento. Nosotros no… - Es tu vida Josh – pero me sentía tan aliviada de saber que no se acostó con ella. Nos quedamos en silencio sin nada más que añadir. Traté de acomodarme para dormir. Teníamos una gran agenda mañana y apenas he tenido la oportunidad de cerrar mis ojos en una corta siesta en 48 horas de turno. El bendito asiento era realmente cómodo. – Ven acá – dijo Josh ofreciéndome sus brazos para acomodarme. No sé por qué, sabía que estaba mal, pero acepté. Mi cabeza se acomodó en su pecho y sus brazos me envolvieron de una manera que parecían piezas de rompecabezas que encajaban perfectamente. Me dormí en la calidez y la protección que solo él me ofrecía. Desperté cuando sentí que algo rozaba mi rostro. Un suave toque en mi frente y luego en mi mentón. Abrí mis ojos para encontrarme con el rostro de Josh sonriendo. Era imposible no regresarle la sonrisa. - No puedo resistirme cuando tu rostro hace todas esas caras, además estamos por aterrizar. Me alejé suavemente de su abrazo y por alguna razón me sentí vulnerable al perder su contacto. Bajamos en silencio y fuimos por nuestras maletas. Salimos en busca de un taxi. – Bienvenida a Kentucky. Nos dirigíamos a su casa. Tendremos un millón de eventos y reuniones esta semana en Unión y Josh había insistido que nos quedáramos en su casa. Estoy pensando seriamente que no es una buena ida. – No creo que deba quedarme en tu casa. Será mejor que me vaya a un hotel. - Tonterías. Estaremos más cómodos en mi casa. Si tenemos que trabajar hasta tarde podemos hacerlo ahí. Además mi familia estará gustosa de que te quedes con nosotros. – me miró suplicante – Vamos Alex. Solo soy un amigo que invita a su amiga a quedarse con su familia. - Vale, solo porque quiero ver a Connor. Llegamos a la que supongo es su casa. para el dinero que Josh tiene supuse encontrarme con alguna mansión o algo por el estilo pero me encontre algo que me gusto mucho mas. Una villa acogedora, con un gran jardín delantero, con grandes ventanas y puertas de madera. Me gustó mucho. - Bienvenida a mi hogar. – dijo tomando mi maleta y abriendo su puerta delantera. Por dentro el decorado era aun mas hogareño. Una sala con muebles cómodos frente a un televisor, un comedor, una cocina con aparadores de mármol y madera. Y una puerta de cristal que dejaba a la vista una gran patio posterior. Josh se apresuró a salir al cesped y a abrazar a dos perros que corrieron hacia él. - ¡Diesel! ¡Nixon! Los extrañé muchachos- dijo acariciandola cabeza a ambos. – Ven aca, Alex. Quiero presentarte a mis hijos. Me acerqué y ambos canes corrieron hacia mí. Tuve que reprimir un gemido cuando se abalanzaron sobre mí. De alguna manera tropecé y caí de bruces. Un de ellos lamís mi cara y el otro mi mano. – A un lado muchachos. - decía Josh ofreciendome su mano para ponerme de pie. – Te aman. ¿Estás bien? - Tranquilo. Mi trasero aun duele pero nada que no pueda controlar. – le dije dandole un ligero codazo - Debo admitir Hutcherson que no espere que con tus genes tengas hijos tan lindos. - Ja, Ja. Que chistosita. – empezó a ahcerme cosquilla y nuevamente tropecé. Caí de bruces y el sobre mí. Mi risa era histérica. - Basta Josh. Me voy a hacer pi-pi – dije entrecortadamente. Pero nada lo detenía de hacerme reír. Sus manos estaba en todo mi torso y no podía respirar normalmente por la risa. Luego de un rato se detuvo. Miré hacia arriba y su rostro estaba a tan solo unos centímetros del mío. Su cuerpo había terminado sobre el mío de alguna manera, enjaulandome. Su mirada intensa flotaba de mis ojos a mis labios y yo hacía lo mismo. Se que lo iba a pasar y a difrencia de la otra noche, esta vez queria, no, necesitaba que me besará. - Josh – nos apartamos de un salto cuando Michelle lo llamó. Fue realmente incómodo. Era obvio que ella vió lo que iba a pasar pero disimulo con mucho tino. Me recibió con sus brazos abiertos. Ella era encantadora, obviamente algo que sus hijos heredaron. Me dijo lo feliz que estaba porque Josh esté en casa y por aceptar quedarme en ella. – Te quedarás en la habitación que era de Josh. - ¿Y él donde se quedará? - Con Connor o en el sofá. – dijo el susodicho mientras llevaba mi maleta dentro de la que supongo es su habitación. - De verdad no puedo permitir eso. No es justo. lo mejor sería que vaya a un hotel. - Por supuesto que no. Vamos Alex, no es ninguna molestia. Es más amo ese sofá – dijo guñándome el ojo. No pude evitar sonreír. - Ustedes dos… estan..? no..? Juntos? – balbuceó Michelle. - No – respondí seriamente, al mismo tiempo que Josh dijo – No, lamentablemente. - Ok. Solo quería asegurarme en lugar de suponer cosas. Bajo las escaleras, dejándonos solos. – No quiero molestar, Josh. - Vamos, Alex… - dijo sentandose sobre su cama, mientras yo examinaba su habitación - Sabes lo muchó que soñé con que esto sucedería algún día. - ¿Ah sí? – sabía que estaba tocando un tema incómodo pero la curiosidad me ganó. - Sip. Soñaba con traerte a mi hogar. Cenar con mi familia, salir a pasear a mis cachorros. Que durmieras en esta cama. Poder hacerte el amor en estas sábanas mientras evitamos gritar con miedo de que mis padres o mi hermano nos esuché. - Mmmmm. Pervertido – dije tratando de romper la tensión. - Quiero hacerte una propuesta, como el buen amigo que soy – él estaba dando unas palmaditas al colchón a su lado por lo que me senté. - Suéltalo. - Mi mamá irá hoy por mi hermano a la casa de mi tía y se quedarán a cenar. Me propusó que vayamos pero le dije que será mejor descansar. Normalmente ellos suelen quedarse hasta muy tarde. ¿Quieres ver una película conmigo? - ¿Lo dices en serio? - Claro. Somos amigos. No tiene nada malo que hagamos cosas de amigos. – su entusiasmo era contagioso. - Vale. Ya llegada la noche, Michelle se despidió para ir a la casa de su hermana. Nos dio una mirada ni-se-les-ocurra-deshonrar-mi-casa antes de salir porla puerta. Hicimos un sorteo de las películas que tenían disponibles en la casa y nos acómodomos en el sofá para ver Batman. Obviamente Josh estaba muy feliz. La película empezó y ambos nos acomodamos en el sofá de frente al televisor. No era muy grande, pero la distancia entre ambos lo era. En algun momento durante la película nuestras manos concidieron en el tazón de palomitas y ese simple rocé me hizo estremecer. - ¡Tienes frío? Puedo conseguirte una manta – no espero mi respuesta, se levantó y tomó una manta afeltapada del armario y la colocó sobre mí. Se sentó a mi lado tirando de la mant para que cubra su regazo. Maldita manta. No era lo suficientemente grande por lo que tuvo que acercarse mas. Colocó su brazo detrás del sofá, muy cerca de mis hombros. Podía sentir el calor de su cuerpo invitando a acurrucarme con él. Y acepto su invitación. De alguna manera nuestros cuerpos estan en contacto y sus brazos se envuelven en mi cuerpo. - ¿Esto está bien? – pregunta temeroso. - Sí – digo segura. Se supone que debe estar bien. Muchas veces hemos estado así de cerca,no entiendo por que estoy tan afectada en estos momentos. - Bien – dice mirando a la pantalla del televisor. Trato de concentrarme en aquella película que he visto un millon de veces pero en esta ocasión siento que no tengo idea de que trata. Mi mente solo se centra en él. Mi ojos tardan en abrirse y estoy mirando un pecho con el queno recuerdo haberme quedado dormida. Levanto mi barbilla para encontrarme con el suave rostro de Josh dormido. En algún momento se había desplazado debajo de mí y había llevado nuestros pies al sofá. No me resisto a tocarlo y trazo mi dedo por cada delicado rasgo de su rostros hasta que llego a sus labios. No es correcto querer tocarlos ni muhco menos besarlos. Pero me atraen y me provocan como si fueran agua y yo murierar de sed. De mucha sed. Me detengo cuando me doy cuenta que su respiración ya no es calmada. Miro sus ojos y están abiertos observandome. Siento mi piel tornarse roja. – Holap. - Hey – le digo intentando salir de él pero no hay lugar para poner mis manos, por lo que termino rodando sobre él y con su ayuda terminamos volcandonos fuera del sofá. Josh aterrizando sobre mí. - ¿Estás bien? – me da la impresión de que trata de aguantar la risa. - Te estás riendo de mí. - No lo hago. – dice ahogandos e n risa – Lo siento pero por primera vez eres tú quien golpea el suelo. Es bueno variar de vez en cuando. - Imbécil. - ¿Dónde te duele? - Mi hombro y sobretodo mi cadera que golpeó el suelo. De pronto su rostro se torna intenso y en un abrir y cerrar de ojos siento sus labios sobre mi hombro derecho y juro por Dios que el dolor se esfumó siendo reemplazado por grandes olas de calor. Un gemido. Un gran gemido se me escapa cuando sus labios tocan mi cadera descubierta, y que mi camisa se había levantado. Pero él no se detiene y un camino de besos sube por mi torso y a pesar de que son dejados sobre mi ropa se sienten como si fueran sobre mi piel. Su aliento cálido llega a mi cuello y me veo envuelta en millares de sensaciones estimulantes y maravillosas. Su rostro ahora está sobre el mío y quiero desesperadamente que me bese. Lo necesito. A él. A sus labios. Pero se aparta tan rápidamente que que hace lanzar un gemido lamentable. Quiero preguntarle que lo detuvo porque obviamente yo estaba mas que dispuesta. La respuesta llega a mí cuando el sonido de la puerta de su cochera cerrandose me indica que su familia esta de regreso. Una vez de pie nuestras miradas se encuentras. – Lamento mucho. Te juro que no volverá a sucerder, pero por favor no me alejes. - Tranquilo – no era solo su culpa – Es dificil pero lo intentaremos con mas fuerza… amigo. - Alex – miro a Connor correr hacia mí. Un último vistazo a Josh que camina de una manera muy rara por las escaleras me recuerda lo difícil que se está volviendo esto. Hoooola... pueden matarme pero acabo de llegar de mi viaje y lo primero q hice fue publicar y eso q aun no terminó el siguiente cap :) Tengo q ir a dormir así que seré breve.

Distinto. Cálido. Me hace perder muy fácilmente la cabeza. Me dejo llevar por cada caricia, por cada palabra, por cada gesto. Se veía tan hermoso con todos esos pequeños, simplemente no pude resistirme, no pude evitar que mi corazón latiera de esa manera por él, no pude evitar querer sentirlo cerca. Pero tampoco pude responder sus preguntas. No podía dar respuestas a lo que ni yo mismo sabía.[Chapter 90] Capítulo 90 Me encontré con sus ojos mirándome fijamente. Ya no entendía su actitud ni sus acciones. No estoy loco y no estoy tan desesperado que imagino cosas. Sé que ella está celosa de la posibilidad de alguien más en mi vida. Sé que cuando está conmigo solo es capaz de sonreír a excepción de aquellas veces en las que entra en conflicto. Sé que se deja arrastrar por las sensaciones que mis caricias le brindan. la he visto perder la cabeza bajo mi toque, estremecerse bajo mi tacto… perderse con mis besos. La vuelvo loca. De deseo. De lujuria. Y de algo más que diría es amor pero no quiero darle nombre. Lo de ser amigos no solo me consume a mí; ella también está afectada, estoy seguro. La he atrapado mirándome muchas veces, de una forma protectora, dulce, intensa… reclamándome con suyo. Como miras lo que es de tu propiedad y lo que… amas. Camina decididamente hacia mí. No puedo evitar que mi corazón lata desbocado al ritmo de sus pasos. Mis manos por alguna razón tiemblan y me aferro al pequeño niño que tengo entre mis manos tratando de que no se note. - Serias un buen niñero – dice señalando con su cabeza el monto de pequeños que están a mi alrededor reclamando atención. Habíamos inaugurado la nueva área oncológica infantil en un hospital de mi ciudad de origen. Todo gracias a nuestras gestiones. Por insistencia de mi niña nos escapamos del banquete y nos quedamos jugando con todos los niños a quienes nuestro trabajo les favorecía. - Creo que les agrado. - Ni que lo digas – le paso al pequeño que tenía entre mis brazos quien inmediatamente empezó a jugar con su cabellos. La escena se veía completamente encantadora. Una punzada de añoranza me atravesó al recordar todas aquellas veces que hablábamos de nuestros hijos. Nuestra familia. Aun deseo tanto tener eso con ella. El pequeño jugaba con ella, al mismo tiempo me hacía un gesto con su manito para que me acercara. Obedecí. No sé qué me impulsó a enredar mis brazos en su cintura desde atrás. Apoye mi mentón en su hombro y para mi sorpresa, Alex no me apartó. Me miró a los ojos y me regaló una dulce sonrisa antes de volverse a encontrarse con el pequeño. Todo se sentí tan correcto. Tan familiar. Tan… tan mío. Ella era mía, no importaba lo que dijera. Nos pertenecíamos. Su lugar estaba entre mis brazos. Ella se relajaba en mis manos, ella sonreía en mis brazos. ¿Por qué no puede ser de esta manera por siempre? Dejo al pequeño en el suelo que arremetió a correr con los demás por toda la sala de juegos. Claramente podía acostumbrarme al millón de gritos y desorden de pequeñuelos, si la tengo a ella de esta manera: mis brazos estrechando su cintura, su espalda relajada contra mi pecho, el latido de su corazón bajo mi tacto. Me provoca. Besé la parte posterior de su cuello. Y para hacer más asombroso mi día, sus manos tomaron las mías entrelazando nuestros dedos. Tenía que mirarla, necesitaba ver sus ojos y tratar de entender el significado de sus acciones. Giré su cuerpo para enfrentar su rostro al mío. Un segundo más tarde nuestras miradas conectaron. Dos segundos luego nuestros labios se amoldaban a los del otro. No tengo idea de quién inició el beso, pero el simple hecho de que ella corresponda a cada rocé de mis labios era lo suficiente para invitarme a continuar. Me llevaba volando al cielo y estaba caminando en las nubes. Había alcanzado el paraíso. O tal vez era el infierno porque maldita sea, sentía que ardía. Sus brazos alrededor de mi cuello, sus manos jugando con mis cabellos. No había ningún espacio entre nosotros. - Alex… - gemí contra sus labios. - Shhh- respondió evitando que me quejara. ¿en serio ella creía que iba a protestar por esto? Si me siento en el maldito cielo. Consciente del espectáculo que dábamos a los niños tire de ella hacia el armario que estaba a un lado. No deje sus labios ni un segundo. Cuando el clic que indico el cierre de la puerta sonó, sus manos viajaron al dobladillo de mi camisa liberándola del pantalón y luego trabajando en cada botón. Su tacto en mi pecho desnudo prendió fuego en toda mi piel. Tomé sus muslos y la arrincone contra la puerta permitiendo que enrolle sus piernas en mi cintura. Mi boca se deleitaba con la piel de su cuello y sus hombros desnudos gracias a su maldita y ardiente blusa strapless. La amaba tanto que no me importaba su rechazo. Me conformaba con estos extraños momentos en que el mundo y la situación que nos rodeaba no importaban en absoluto. Dos golpes en la puerta nos volvieron a la realidad. Nos quedamos paralizados con el temor de ser atrapados. Otro par de golpes acompañados de una gran risa – Oh. Vamos chicos. Tienen la noche para dejarse llevar. Los quiero en cinco minutos en el banquete para el brindis y tú discurso, Alexandra. Escuchamos a Collins alejarse riendo. El momento pasional desapareció completamente. Ahora era tiempo de lamentarse por lo que no debería haber ocurrido. En verdad estaba preparado para que sus palabras rompan mi corazón pero Alex no dijo nada. Me pasó mi camisa que había terminado en algún lado. Se acomodó su ropa y abrió la puerta para salir. Me apresure a retenerla, tomando su brazo. – Quiero hablar. Ella se volvió a mí besándome con intensidad, cerrando así nuestra conversación. Se fue luego del beso, dejándome solo para lidiar con el millón de preguntas. ¿Qué había sucedido? Y ¿Qué se supone que significa esto? O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O No podía seguir durmiendo. No entendía que sucedía conmigo. Desde que llegué aquí prácticamente estoy lanzándome sobre Josh cada vez que no puedo reprimirme. Me olvido de que él ya no me pertenece. Me olvido de tengo a otra persona en mi vida. Me olvido de que no debería desearlo bajo ninguna circunstancia. Pero estar lejos de todos esos malos recuerdos, estar en su mundo. Distinto. Cálido. Me hace perder muy fácilmente la cabeza. Me dejo llevar por cada caricia, por cada palabra, por cada gesto. Se veía tan hermoso con todos esos pequeños, simplemente no pude resistirme, no pude evitar que mi corazón latiera de esa manera por él, no pude evitar querer sentirlo cerca. Pero tampoco pude responder sus preguntas. No podía dar respuestas a lo que ni yo mismo sabía. Pateo mis cobijas y decido ir por un vaso con agua. Aunque la luz ya se filtra por las ventanas, en la casa aun reina el silencio. El agua fría me refresca pero mis pensamientos están tan enredados que no podré volver a dormir. Salgo hacia la sala cuando me encuentro con una escena que roba mi aliento. Josh dormía en el sofá donde hace unas noches ambos lo habíamos hecho. A sus pies Paws y Jell-O, sus gatos, estaban acurrucados. Estaba recostado de lado con sus dos manos juntas pegadas a su mejilla como si fuera una almohada. Adorable. Dulce. Fascinante. Sexy. La imagen me atrajo y de pronto encontré de cuclillas frente a su rostro. Admirando cada rasgo, cada línea de su rostro. ¿Por qué tiene que ser tan guapo y sexy? ¿Por qué no puedo olvidarte? ¿Por qué no puedo dejarte ir? Podría mentirme y mentirle siempre, pero lo cierto que no puedo verte solo como mi amigo. Hay muchas cosas más, sin contar la atracción y la química. Simplemente prefiero no darle nombre. Mi dedo tocó su frente y acarició su nariz, luego sus mejillas y finalmente delinee sus labios. Su sueño siempre había sido profundo así que sabía que no se despertaría. Me concentré en sus suaves labios, quienes últimamente me habían mostrado las puertas del cielo. Quería sentirlos… tanto. Me acerqué esperando que no se despertara, esperando que un simple roce me bastara. - ¿Alex? – Michelle estaba mirándome estupefacta al pie de la escalera. Cuando me sorprendió me aparté de golpe que casi provoca que besara el suelo. - yo… lo.. no.. lo siento – no sabía cómo explicar la situación. - Deberías bañarte para que estés lista a tiempo. – solo asentí y subí por la escaleras esquivándola. Alcancé a escuchar como llamaba a Josh para despertarlo cuando cerré la puerta de su baño. Mi mente estuvo totalmente bloqueada mientras me bañaba y me ponía mi vestido azul floreado de verano. No sabía cómo acomodar mi cabello y mucho menos sabía cómo maquillarme. Un par de golpes en la puerta me volvieron a mi realidad. Josh se encontraba al otro lado vestido con un pantalón jean, una playera y una camisa a cuadros. Totalmente comible. - Estás preciosa – dijo mirándome de pies a cabeza deteniéndose a nivel de mi busto donde el leve escote enseñaba un poco de mi busto. - Gracias. Puedes usar tu baño. – ambos chocamos en el ligero espacio cuando él intentó entrar y yo salir. Nos miramos fijamente por un largo momento y de poco a poco esa conexión que se formaba cuando estábamos solos y así de cerca estaba desatándose. Él veía mis labios y yo quería que me besara rápido. Y él quería hacerlo de no ser por Michelle que nos miraba desde la puerta de su habitación. Me deshice rápidamente de la incómoda posición. Mire a Michelle que tenía el ceño fruncido y esperaba que dijera algo. - No sé qué hacer con mi cabello – no sabía que más decir. - Puedo peinarte. Si quieres. – una dulce sonrisa se extendió por su rostro. Me senté frente a su aparador lleno de maquillajes, perfumes y otros objetos personales. Tenía una foto de ella junto a su exesposo y sus dos hijos a un lado. - Tres hombres contra una mujer. - Y aun así yo los dominaba – dijo divertida – aunque admito que quise una chica para poder equilibrar un poco. - Cuando Josh y Connor se casen tendrá chicas que se unan a su equipo – sus dedos que trabajaban trenzando mi cabello se detuvo. - No quiero ser imprudente pero… no entiendo lo que ustedes dos están haciendo. No quiero meterme en sus vidas, nunca lo he hecho con mi hijo pero tengo que decirte lo que pienso. Tal vez no nos conozcamos lo suficiente pero te aprecio, Alexandra. A pesar de todo, a pesar de las veces que vi a mi hijo llorar por que rompiste su corazón, creo que llegaste para bien. Terminó de trenzar mi cabello en manera de una diadema y empezó a aplicar crema en mis rizos. Nuestras miradas se encontraron en el espejo. – De Josh nunca has escuchado de todas sus aventuras. Tal vez lo ocultaba bien o tal vez no era tan famoso como para que alguien le interese hacer publica esa información, pero hubieron muchas, Alex. Yo no apruebo esa fase de la vida de mi hijo. Puede ser el siglo XXI pero no creo que sea correcto que alguien se acueste con personas que conocen a o mucho unos minutos. Tampoco espero que esperen al matrimonio, ni siquiera yo lo hice. Pero creo que por lo menos debes crear un vínculo de cariño y confianza para llegar a ello. Josh cambió contigo. Se dio cuenta de lo valioso que es hacer el amor comparado con tener sexo. Y eso aprendió de ti. Me sonrojé. No me sentía cómoda tratando mi vida sexual y la de su hijo. – Te agradezco por ello. Hubiera querido que seas parte de mi equipo femenino. - Me hubiera sentido honrada que usted forme parte de mi familia – contesté sinceramente. - Josh nunca superó tu pérdida. Sufrió. Sufre mucho por ello. No me gusta verlo de esa manera y no te estoy pidiendo que remedies eso. Respeto tu decisión de no estar con él, porque no lo amas o porque tus razones , como su engaño, son fuertes. Pero, Alex… - suspiró – Estos días los veo y me encuentro con dos personas enamoradas no con un par de amigos. Cualquier persona que no conozca su historia se encontrará con dos chicos que tienen fuertes sentimientos por el otro pero tratan de reprimirlos y ocultarlos. - Yo no… - No te culpo, Alex – me interrumpió – No te echo la culpa, tampoco creo que estás jugando con mi hijo. A mis ojos, tú también estas confundida y no sabes lo que quieres. Solo te pido como madre, mujer y amiga que busques lo que en verdad quieres. Que encuentres lo que en verdad sientes. Por primera vez se egoísta y elije por ti. Elige tu felicidad que no siempre será el camino más fácil, pero si haces lo que dicta tu corazón ira bien. Aceptémoslo, alguien saldrá daño de esto pero si esa persona es Josh lo aceptaré y él lo hará algún día. Seguirá a delante. Mientras más pronto elijas, mejor para todos. Sin una palabra más salió de su habitación dejándome sola con cada una de sus palabras rebotando en mi mente. Pero cuando empezaba a analizarlas, Josh apareció en la puerta ofreciéndome su mano para acudir a nuestra cita. Estuve perdida en mis pensamientos, reflexionando cada palabra de Michelle. Josh intentó iniciar una charla pero mi falta de concentración lo impedía. Estábamos invitados a un picnic organizado por la esposa de Collins. Muchos asistentes eran personas que participan en nuestra causa. Me acerqué a tomar un poco de ponche. Todos estaban muy alegres y un poco tomados. - ¿Te gusta el ponche? – dijo Josh abordándome. - Este bueno – respondí suavemente. - ¿Podemos hablar? - Vamos Josh – la voz de Collins nos interrumpió. – Ponte unos apntalodes, échatela a los hombros y llévatela como un hombre, por el amor de Dios. Los invitados nos miraron y empezaron a reír. ¡Qué vergüenza! Sabía que tenía que hacer algo para aligerar el ambiente. - Hombre de las carvernas – dije en tono divertido – No es el estilo de Josh. - Beso. Beso. Beso – Collins gritaba y el resto de invitados empezaron a corear con él. Miré a Josh en busca de ayuda. - ¿Puedo llevarte a todas mis citas? – le preguntó divertido. - Por su puesta. Te diré lo que tienes que hacer a cada momento.- todos rieron con los comentarios de Josh y Collins – Primero coges a la chica y la agarras por… - Me alegro de que la testosterona no sea una enfermedad contagiosa – la esposa de Collins le interrumpió. Tomó su brazo y se llevó a su marido que estaba un poco ebrio. Nos dio una mirada de disculpa al pasar a nuestro lado. - Vamos - Josh tomó mi mano y llevo por toda la recepción disculpándonos por la premura de nuestra partida. El viaje en auto fue un borrón y pronto estuvimos sentados en la oscuridad y en el silencio de su auto dentro de su garaje. - No podemos seguir haciendo esto. – esas palabras me sonaban conocidas. - No podemos fingir que no están pasando cosas entre nosotros – replicó. Sus manos se aferraban al volante. - No puede pasar nada, Josh. - ¿Por qué, Alex? ¿Por qué negarlo? - Porque lo elijo a él, Josh – mis palabras le produjeron que su rostro se contrajera de dolor. Pero él no sabía que cada palabra que salía de mi boca me hacía el mismo daño que a él. - Entonces… ¿Volvemos a lo de amigos? - Si tú quieres – suspiré – pero debemos hacerlo mejor. Su frente reposaba en el volante. No me miró a los ojos cuando respondió. – Si quiero. Hoola :) Se q quieren matarme pero en realidad van a tener q tenerme paciencia. mi nuevo horario es completamente loco de lunes - jueves... y la verdad q no he escrito nada... no iba a publicar pero decidí q no es justo.. apenas llevo unas pocas lineas del siguiente cap q es lo q tiene de avance.

Quería decirle que había sentido sus labios, sus caricias, sus suspiros. Pero mi pedido llegó. - ¿Tienes tiempo para un café? - Claro. – salí detrás de él y llegamos a una cafetería. Nos sentamos en silencio mientras esperábamos nuestros pedidos.[Chapter 91] Capítulo 91 Me detuve en seco cuando lo encontré en la joyería. Había encargado una pulsera para el cumpleaños de mi mamá y venía a retirarla. Mientras esperaba, Darío entró por la puerta. - Josh – saludó en mi dirección, luego de hacer su pedido y sentarse a mi lado a esperar. - Darío – saludé de regreso. Iba a tratar de entablar a una conversación cuando una de las personas que atendían se acercó a él con una pequeña cajita. Reveló un anillo de compromiso, delicado, sencillo, precioso. Mi aliento se quedó atrapado al entender el significado de esto. - ¿Crees que le gusté? – preguntó. Me tomo cada gramo de mi energía responder – Es su estilo. - Tengo el anillo, ahora tengo que buscar la ocasión para proponérselo. Iba a gritarle que había sido engañado. Quería decirle que ella había estado al borde de ser mía. Quería decirle que había sentido sus labios, sus caricias, sus suspiros. Pero mi pedido llegó. - ¿Tienes tiempo para un café? - Claro. – salí detrás de él y llegamos a una cafetería. Nos sentamos en silencio mientras esperábamos nuestros pedidos. - ¿Sabías que yo le di su primer beso? – No y no quería saber eso. – Con mi hermano habíamos conocido por años a Fernanda, siempre nos reuníamos para un partido de baloncesto cada viernes. Un día Fer llegó con Alex diciendo que era su nueva vecina. Me impresionó desde aquel momento. Era dulce, divertida, sincera y muy hermosa. Jugamos un partido entre nosotros y en algún momento su tobillo se dobló. No lloró a pesar de que su tobillo se inflamo terriblemente. La llevé en brazos a su casa y ella se aferró a mí. Era una sensación extraña, como si ella perteneciera a ese lugar entre mis brazos. Sonrió y sacudió su cabeza mientras seguía recordando – Le pregunté porque no lloró, mientras le colocaba una bolsa de hielo que me dio su mamá, yo personalmente hubiera hecho el gran drama. Quizás le inspiré confianza porque terminó contándome su historia. Leucemia. Había sufrido los peores dolores, un tobillo no era nada. Nos volvimos buenos amigos y cada día me gustaba más. Era… perfecta. - Lo sé – aseguré. - Cumplió 16 años y le hicimos una pequeña reunión para festejarlos. Había tenido un accidente días antes por lo que estaba enyesada por una pequeña fractura en su pie. Jugamos a la botella y los 2 señalados tenían que encerrarse en una de las habitaciones. La llevé en brazos cuando la botella nos apuntó a los dos. Mientras la depositaba en su cama ella me hizo cosquillas y caí sobre ella. La besé. No pude resistirme más, necesitaba probar esos labios que se burlaban de mi cada día, pero inmediatamente luego sabía que lo había hecho mal. No la merecía. Nadie la merecía. – suspiró – una semana después conseguí novia y evité a Alex a toda costa. Santiago que andaba con Fernanda le había confesado que aquel era su primer beso. Me sentí como la peor basura. Seguí evitándola y convenciéndome a mí mismo que estaba enamorado de mi novia. - Ella tuvo novios. Varios. Pero sus relaciones no duraban mucho. Ingresó a la universidad y fue compañera de mi hermano. Ella estaba mucho a mí alrededor. Nuestra relación de amistad de alguna manera regresó en parte a ser la misma. Pero metí la pata cuando no puede resistirme a sus encantos y nos besamos. Y volvía a pasar una y otra vez cuando nos quedábamos solos. Me atraía tremendamente, eso es lo que quería pensar. Solo atracción física. - Aprovechábamos cada momento para dejarnos llevar. Cuando ella estaba dispuesta a entregarse a mí, supe que me amaba y yo era el estúpido que se aprovechaba de eso y no le daba su lugar. Quería convencerla y convencerme a mí mismo que podía estar con ella y no era porque la amara. Mientras quitaba su ropa le dije que solo era físico, que la atracción era fuerte y que solo sería sexo. Ella huyó y no la seguí porque yo suponía que era lo mejor. La amaba tanto. Llegué a entenderlo cuando la vi irse, pero definitivamente yo no la merecía. Tendría que hacer lo necesario para cambiar eso. Me dolió saber que se iba a Denver, pero eso me daría tiempo de arreglar las cosas. Contaba cada día para su regreso. La besé en cuanto la tuve en mi frente. Tenía a la chica de mis sueños, la chica que amaba a mi lado. Nunca esperé que ella te conociera. El resto de la historia ya la conoces. - No puedo creer que la perdí – dije frustrado. - Ambos tuvimos oportunidades. Lo único que quiero es que ella sea feliz y si tú lo hubiera logrado o hubiera interferido, Josh. Lo juro. Pero ella ahora es mía. La amo. Y te pido que la dejes ser feliz conmigo. Entendí que él verdaderamente la merecía. Mi parte egoísta no quería resignarse a perderla pero tampoco podía hacer a un lado sus decisiones. Su felicidad. Así que busque una respuesta que me dejara conforme: - Mientras ella te elija, no interferiré. Lo vi marcharse con aquel anillo, temiendo el día en que lo vea en su dedo. Horas más tarde estaba en el bar más cercano al hotel donde Claudia se quedaba, esperándola. Apenas recuerdo su llegada, nuestras copas brindando y a ella tirando de mi ropa en su habitación. La cabeza me palpitaba cuando desperté con su cuerpo enredado al mío. Lo que sucedió no había sido un error. Lo había hecho porque necesitaba una forma de escapar de mi cruda realidad. Necesitaba sentirme querido, deseado, pero no debería haber usado a Claudia para ello, pero tampoco me arrepentía. Abandoné su hotel sin decirle palabra alguna. Pasé por mi departamento para cambiarme y tratar de comer algo. Alex apareció en nuestra oficina casi a las 5pm. Cada paso en mi dirección provocaba un dolor profundo en mi cabeza. – Tienes resaca – dijo viéndome tendido en el sofá. Buscó en su cartera y luego me pasó un par de pastillas y un poco de agua - ¿Alguna razón para emborracharse o simple diversión? - No quiero hablar del tema – dije recordando la razón de terminar así. - Entonces duerme por un rato, gruñón – una tímida sonrisa bailaba en su rostro. Me preguntaba el porqué. No quería suponer que era por la propuesta de Darío – Yo seguiré donde nos quedamos. - Debo ayudarte. - No me sirves en ese estado. Duerme pequeño. – acarició mi frente y eso fue lo suficiente para sumirme en un profundo sueño. Cuando desperté todo estaba oscuro. Por la ventana veía la oscuridad de la noche filtrarse. Alex tecleaba en la computadora. Su rostro era iluminado por la luz de su pantalla y una lámpara a su lado. Caminé hacia ella. - Vaya, ya despertaste. ¿Te sientes mejor? - Nop – dije sentándome a su lado. - ¿Te duele aún? Puedo darte otro ibuprofeno. - No es eso. Estoy como nuevo, pero no debería haber dejado que hagas todo el trabajo. ¿Puedo ayudar en algo? - En realidad estoy a punto de imprimir el documento. - Oh – me sentía agobiado – Lo siento. - No es nada. Tú también has tenido que trabajar más cuando yo he venido somnolienta de mis turnos – se levantó aponer papel en la impresora. - ¿Qué hora es? - Casi media noche. - No puedo creer que no me despertaras – había dormido casi 7 horas. - Olvídalo. Necesitabas descansar. Mejor ven que quiero mostrarte algo. – me ofreció sus manos y me llevó al sofá nuevamente. – Cierra los ojos. - ¿Para qué? - Por una vez en tu vida no seas terco y haz lo que te digo – obviamente obedecí. La escuché caminar por la oficina y luego sentí su peso hundirse a mi lado en el sofá – Aún no los abras. - Vamos, me estoy desesperando. – el pitido del reloj indicando que era media noche invadió el silencio. - Ábrelos – lo hice y me encontré con su rostro muy cerca del mío. En sus manos tenía un pastelillo bañado en chocolate con mi nombre en él escrito con crema y una pequeña vela encendida. – Feliz Cumpleaños, Josh. Había olvidado completamente la fecha. 25 años. Pareciera que el tiempo se hubiera detenido cuando la conocí hace 5 años. Y no puedo creer que ella lo hubiera recordado. - ¿Es para mí? Su risa nos inundó - ¿Ves a otro Josh por aquí? - No, pero es bueno asegurarse. - Pide un deseo. Lo pedí. Pedí más oportunidades como está. Pedí por una vida con ella porque era lo que más deseaba. Pedí ser el único dueño de su corazón y en verdad espero que mi deseo se cumpla. Soplé la velita y ella aplaudió. - Ahora debes morderlo – dijo acercando el pastelillo a mi boca. - Solo si lo compartimos – le di una mordida y luego ella. Un poco de chocolate quedó alrededor de su boca, me aproximé a ella para limpiarla. Nos estremecimos cuando mis dedos tocaron su piel. Nuestras miradas se encontraron y lo siguiente que supe es que nuestros labios estaban en contacto. El mundo desapareció a nuestro alrededor. Solo éramos ella y yo. No entendía porque ella negaba lo que teníamos y porque razón no podía elegirme a mí, si juntos éramos perfectos. Lastimosamente la realidad llegó a ella y la sentí tensarse. No podía dejar que esto terminara mal, nuevamente. Mis manos fueron a sus costillas y empezaron a hacerle cosquillas. Se retorcía bajo mis manos tratando de escapar. En medio de su desesperación su codo golpeó mi mandíbula y terminé en el suelo. - Oh por Dios. Lo siento. - No te preocupes – dije sobándome mi mandíbula. Eso dejaría un gran golpe. - Lo siento. No quería golpearte. No deberías haberme hecho cosquillas. - Quería hacerte reír. ¿Cómo se ve mi cara? Ella frunció su ceño – Mañana tendrás un gran moretón. - Me lo merezco. Si alguien pregunta voy a decirles que estuve en una pelea de bar. - ¿Te da vergüenza decir que una chica te golpeó? - No es eso. – dije seriamente – Me preocupa que te encierren por violencia doméstica. Ambos nos echamos a reír. – Tuvieras que visitarme en la cárcel. ¿Imaginas los titulares? El famoso Josh Hutcherson maltratado a golpes por una chica. - Sería una gran vergüenza. - Será mejor que nos vayamos – no quería que este momento termine. Tomamos nuestras cosas y le acompañé para conseguir un taxi. Antes de que suba en él ella me enfrentó: - No hagas planes para más tarde. Te llamó luego. Se fue dejándome emocionado por la posibilidad de que ella quiere pasar tiempo conmigo. Hooola ... bueno tengo q correr de turno.. esta semana q paso y la q vienen tratan de matarme.. tengo clases todos los días de 7am a 9pm... no resisto mas.. asiq tendrán q disculparme un poco :P Quería q escucharan la versión de Darío ahora espero sus reviews.. ¿Que creen q sucederá?

A Great Big World & Christina Aguilera - Say Something www_youtube_com/watch?v=BZxUv3y1LYU[Chapter 92] Capítulo 92 - ¿Qué haces? – preguntó Fernanda. - Un pastelillo – respondí mientras sacaba del horno el postre ya listo. - ¿Por? –su mirada inquisitiva surgió. - Por Josh. Por su cumpleaños. Pero aun necesito que se enfríe antes de decorarlo. - Oh… ¿Cómo va su \"amistad\"? - Nuestra amistad va bien. Agradecería que no insinúes que algo funciona mal. - Yo no he dicho nada – levantó sus manos en señal de rendición. - Pero estas pensando, así que suéltalo. Si lo que te mueres por decir. - Él te ama. - Dime algo que no sepa – con ella podía ser sincera. - Tú también – iba a replicar pero ella continuó - Sientes algo fuerte pero no quieres reconocerlo. - Es mi amigo. Por supuesto que lo quiero. Ella me dio una mirada irritada y sacudió su cabeza – No sé lo que estás haciendo pero deberías dejar de mentirte a ti misma – tomó su bolso – nos vemos luego. Dale un abrazo de mi parte. Me recosté en el sofá y tome un libro. Tenía que matar el tiempo mientras el pastelillo se enfríaba. Mi celular vibró y la cara de mi novio apareció en la pantalla. - Hola, pequeño – saludé. - Hola princesa ¿cómo estás? - Bien. Un poco sola. - Desearía estar contigo. Es raro tener el departamento tan solo y aun quiero estrenar ese sofá. - Sucio – reí pero sentí como parte de mí le disgustaba esa idea. - Sabes que no puedes resistirte. ¿Dónde están todos? No he visto a mi hermano cuando me fui. - Fernanda acaba de irse, tiene turno hasta mañana y tú hermano salió de la ciudad para una campaña de vacunación. - Oh vaya. Quisiera estar contigo para mimarte. - No te preocupes. Josh y yo debemos terminar unos informes hoy. No sé qué tiempo nos tome pero estaremos ocupados. - Pasas más tiempo con él de lo que me siento a gusto. - Nada de celos. Prometiste confiar en mí. – en cuanto las palabras salieron de mi boca la culpa me atravesó. - Solo digo lo que pienso. Confío en ti completamente. Me tengo que ir, pequeña. Ya tengo que embarcar. - Vale. Te quiero. Que tengas un buen viaje. - Te amo, Alex. Sus palabras invadieron mi corazón pero no era una sensación cálida, todo lo contrario, sus palabras solo me invadían de dudas y culpa. No tuve tiempo de meditar porque una nueva llamada entró en mi celular. - ¿Hola? - ¿Alexandra? – la voz de una mujer sonaba al otro lado. - Sí. - Oh que alivio. No sabía si este era tu número. Habla Jenn. - ¿Jenn? – no tenía idea de quien era. - Jennifer Lawrence. Deberías reconocerme, dijiste que eras mi fan – me quedé en silencio – Solo bromeaba. Necesito un favor. - Dime – aún estaba impresionada por su forma rápida de hablar. - Avan, Liam y yo estamos preparando una pequeña fiesta para Josh. Una sorpresa, solo amigos íntimos. Necesitamos que lleves a Josh al sitio donde será. Ya lo intentamos, pero no acepto salir con ninguno de nosotros, pero estamos seguros de que contigo iría al mismo infierno. - Deberías hablar con Claudia. Ella es su… algo. Estoy segura de que puede ayudarte. - Por favor, Alex. Ambas sabemos que era la única con poder sobre Josh y entre nosotros Claudia no me agrada mucho. Vamos, tienes que ayudarnos. - Vale. Envíame un mensaje con todo lo que tengo que saber. - Nos vemos chica. Decoré el pastelillo y salí de mi departamento. Cuando llegué Josh estaba tirado en el sofá. Sus ojos rojos y parecía que cada paso que daba le producía dolor. Tenía resaca y muy mal humor. Luego de darle medicación lo deje dormir. Me dediqué a terminar nuestro informe. Su imagen era tierna. Su rostro relajada y cada rasgo se suavizaba haciéndolo lucir como un niño. Escuché que murmuraba algo y me acerqué. No me resistí a acariciar su rostro. \"Alex\" salió de sus labios. Mi corazón se hizo chiquito y se llenó de calidez. Besé su frente y volví a mi trabajo. No quería analizar lo complicado que eran mis sentimientos. Cuando despertó y comimos su pastelillo, sus ojos no me abandonaban. Cuando nuestros labios se encontraron, toda mi resistencia se iba por un desagüe. Mi mente se quedaba en blanco y oleadas de placer me envolvían. Recordar la situación que vivíamos me llenaba de pesar y culpa. Era cobarde. Prefería mantenerme en negación. No analizar lo que sucedía, no admitir que era una mala persona, no complicarme con reconocer sentimientos. Su rostro se iluminó cuando le dije que no haga planes porque la pasaríamos juntos. Dormí casi todo el día. Me desperté 3 horas antes de lo que acordé con Jenn. Había enviado la dirección que al parecer era una casa fuera de la ciudad. Por lo menos 2 horas de recorrido. Tomé mi auto que rara vez usaba. Llegué al departamento de Josh y le envié un mensaje avisándole que estaba estacionada en frente. Bajé del auto para tomar un poco de sol mientras esperaba. - ¿Tu novio te permite estar aquí? – la vocecita de Claudia me irritaba. ¿Qué mierda hacía aquí? - No es de tu incumbencia. Además, no necesito el permiso de nadie para hacer lo que quiero. Mi novio confía en mí. - Pues está ciego al no darse cuenta de lo que pasa. - Y según tú ¿qué es lo que pasa? – le desafié. - Pasa que eres una zorra que tiene novio y que se acuesta con su ex. - ¿Se supone que porque tú lo dices tengo que ofenderme? Para que lo sepas, ante mis ojos no eres más que una buscona que salta a la cama de chico que no te quiere y que posiblemente nunca lo haga porque esta locamente enamorado de mí. – Quería herirla. Estaba siendo cruel. Ella no se merecía que le echara en cara sus problemas pero era quien me había ofendido primero. - Eres una… – sabía la siguiente palabra y también anticipaba la cacheteada que me iba a dar, pero la mano de Josh la detuvo. - No te atrevas a tocarla – él le advirtió. - Ella me insultó – dijo haciendo un mohín. - Tú me ofendiste primero. Si te dolió fue por algo. La verdad duele, querida. - Alex - la voz de Josh era una clara advertencia de que parara. - ¿Qué haces aquí, Claudia? - Es tú cumpleaños… esperaba que nosotros… - titubeaba – Pensé que luego de la otra noche… Fue pero que un cacheteada entender a lo que se refería. Me sentía traicionada. Me dolía. Ellos había estado juntos y aunque no debería importarme, mi corazón se rompía en pedazos. - Te espero en el auto – dije abriendo la puerta. De alguna manera esperaba que Josh aun viniera conmigo. Puse música a todo volumen mientras evitaba poner mi mirada en ellos. Vi a Claudia irse enojada y un momento después Josh se acomodaba en el asiento de copiloto. Arranqué el auto en silencio y me metí rápidamente entre las calles siguiendo mi ruta. Josh no intento hablar conmigo aunque sentía como retenía. Fue una mala idea ayudar a Jenn. Antes de tomar el último desvío detuve el auto. Josh me miro sorprendido. – ¿Vamos a hablar? - No tenemos nada de qué hablar. – alcancé una venda que estaba en mi bolso – Solo cúbrete los ojos con esto. Me miró preocupado pero tomó el pedazo de tela – No entiendo. Quiero saber lo que piensas. - Si te refieres a lo de Claudia no tengo nada que decir. Es tu vida, Josh. Ella no me gusta pero ´tu haz dejado claro que es tu vida. Ahora quiero que te vendes los ojos. Me miro por un momento y luego hizo lo que le pedí. Envié un mensaje a Jenn para avisarle nuestra llegada ante de conducir hasta el conjunto de cabañas que habían reservado. En cuanto me estacioné aprecie todo. Un lago, un muelle y unas ocho cabañas dispuestas en círculo sobre una plazoleta donde habían decorado con luces, mesas con bebidas y comida. A un lado estaba un DJ con todo su armamento. Debería preguntarle a Jenn a que se refería con amigos íntimos porque aquí había más de 50 personas. Todo estaba en silencio, así que baje del auto y corrí a abrirle la puerta a Josh. - Vamos – dije tomándolo de sus manos. - No estarás planeando asesinarme. Acepto un secuestro. - Cállate y camina. – todos los invitados estaban en silencio. Guié a Josh para ubicarlo en el centro de la plaza, mientras todos tomaron sus lugares. Jenn me dio una señal y quite su venda. Todos gritaron \"SORPRESA\" y empezaron a cantar \"Happy Birthday\". Josh estaba sorprendido pero se animó mucho con su sorpresa. Todos se acercaron a felicitarlo y pronto empezó la música a sonar. Muchos bailaban, conversaban, incluso algunos jugaban cartas. El ambiente era muy cómodo y entretenido. - Alex – Jenn llegó a mi lado con su novio – Gracias por traerlo. Este es Nick. - Un gusto – respondió. - Igualmente – respondí. Ellos fueron junto al resto de personas que bailaban. Me senté en un rincón observando a todos por un largo momento. - Vaya. Por fin te llego a conocer – me giré para encontrarme con Avan. No nos habían presentado, pero sabía quién era. – Hola, Alexa. - ¿Alexa? Eres de las pocas personas que me dicen así. No recuerdo habértelo sugerido. - He oído hablar tanto de ti que creo que ya te conozco – dijo señalando a Josh quien habla con un grupo de chicas. Sin duda era el alma de la fiesta. - Me imagino. Vale, puedes llamarme como quieras. - Gracias por ayudarnos con lo de Josh – dijo ofreciéndome un poco de ponche. - No fue nada. Él es mi amigo, es lo menos que podía hacer. - ¿Sabes que él no quieres ser solo tu amigo, verdad? - Pues así son las cosas. Somos amigos. - Vale, no te enojes. ¿Bailamos? – dijo ofreciendo su mano. - No trates de ligarte a mi chica – Josh llegó a nosotros envolviendo sus manos en mi cintura y colocando su mentón en mi hombro. - ¿Tu chica? – preguntamos Avan y yo al mismo tiempo. - Sí. Mi chica. – aseguró Josh mirándome a los ojos. Su aliento olía a alcohol y lo sentía tambaleándose. No puedo creer que este en el camino a la ebriedad tan pronto. El silencio se extendió por un momento. - ¿Quieres cantar algo, Alexa? - ¿Alexa? – preguntó Josh mientras yo respondía – Claro. Me dirigí hacia el DJ mientras pensaba en una canción. Jenn me alcanzó en el camino. También estaba tambaleándose. - Es el cumpleaños de Josh, Alex. Canta algo para él. Una canción que te recuerde lo que sientes por él. – asi como llegó se fue. Gire para encontrarme con Josh aun junto a Avan. No apartaba su mirada de mí. Sus ojos se veían tristes. Pensé en la canción. Tenía que esperar que termine otro de los invitados antes de que sea mi turno de karaoke. Subí al improvisado escenario que solo sobresalía unos 50 centímetros del suelo. Recordé como me hacía sentir Josh cuando recién lo conocí y como me siento ahora cuando él está cerca. Tomé el micrófono y lo mire. En verdad no esperaba que se diera cuenta que la canción era para él porque no quería sembrar falsas esperanzas. (Heart Attack – Demi Lovato: www_youtube_com/watch?v=fZL8UfSMPwQ ) But you make me wanna act like a girl,( Pero me haces actuar como una chica) Paint my nails and wear high heels...( Pintar mis uñas y usar tacos altos) Yes you make so nervous (Si, eres tu, me pones muy nerviosa) that I just can't hold your hand! (que solo no puedo agarrar tu mano) You make me glow, (Tu me haces brillar) But I cover up, won't let it show. (pero yo lo oculto,no lo mostrare, entonces) So I'm putting my defenses up, (Estoy poniendo mis defensas en alto) Cause I don't wanna fall in love! (Por que no quiero enamorarme) If I ever did that, (Porque si lo hago) I think I'd have a heart attack! (Creo que tendría un ataque al corazón) Esta canción quise dedicársela desde que lo conocí, porque él me hacía sentir diferente, él me hacía ser mejor. Si no tengo cuidado podría fácilmente enamorarme de él si es que no lo estoy ya. Mejor no pensar en ello. Terminé la canción con aplausos y camine hacia donde estaban ellos pero Josh me alcanzó en el camino. Me detuvo sosteniéndome del brazo un poco fuerte. Su aliento lleno de alcohol me llegó: - Lamento que tu novio no estuviera aquí para escucharte. Pero esta va para ti. Se subió al escenario y pidió una guitarra. Ajustando el micrófono y con la mirada fija en mí canto. (You Don't See Me - Safetysuit: www_youtube_com/watch?v=S0qRx5YYcoU ) I'd like to hold you (Me gustaría sostenerte) Here in my arms (Aquí en mis brazos) And have you never leave. (Y que nunca te vayas.) And I'd like to give you (Y me gustaría darte) All that I have (Todo lo que tengo) To have you stay with me. (Para que te quedes conmigo.) But you, you don't see me. (Pero tú, tú no me ves) Él no entendía que el problema era en que lo veía de la manera en que no debería. Lo deseaba. Él era mi debilidad y no podía dejarme vencer, tenía que luchar contra eso. Sostuvimos la mirada olvidándonos del mundo. No podía decirle que su dolor era también el mío. Avan tiró de mi brazo hacia el muelle donde un grupo de chicos jugaba con naipes. No eran juegos de mesa. Estaban formando dos hileras en cada extremo una mesa, una con naipes y tora vacía. Tenían que pasar los naipes de un lado al otro solo con la boca. Gana la hilera que pase más naipes en cinco minutos. - Ven a jugar – me invitó Jenn que estaba en una de las hileras junto a su novio. Me coloque a su lado completando el número requerido en esa fila. - Listos – gritó un chico quien tenía un cronómetro. - Esperen – gritó Josh llegando a mi lado. Miró a Jenn tiernamente. - Vale. Puedes tomar jugar pero necesitas alguien que complete el número en la otra fila. - Avan. Por favor. – Avan negó con su cabeza y se ubicó en la otra hilera. Josh se acomodó a mi lado. Yo evitaba mirarlo pero sentía sus ojos taladrándome. - Listos – volvió a gritar el chico con el cronógrafo – 1…2… Vamos. Empezamos a pasar las cartas con rapidez. Era complicado pasar de una persona a otra porque no había manera de asegurarse que la otra persona la tenía sujeta. Si la carta caía teníamos que volver a empezar. Por suerte manteníamos un buen ritmo. - Quedan 9 – avisó el chico cronógrafo – 8…7…6… La carta estaba con Jenn quien le pasó a Josh. Me puse en posición para recibir el naipe pero Josh la dejó caer en el último segundo y estampó sus labios con los míos. Fue brusco e intenso. Su lengua invadió mi boca y sus manos apretaron mis caderas pegándome a su cuerpo. Escuchaba chiflidos y ovaciones que iba desapareciendo. Josh estaba empujándome mientras no besábamos. En algún momento había correspondido a la exigencia de sus labios. Habíamos llegado a la parte trasera de una cabaña. - Para, Josh. – necesitaba que él se detuviera porque yo no me sentía capaz de hacerlo. Mi espalda chocó con la pared. – Por favor. Para. Se detuvo y me miró. Dolor apareció en su rostro y sus ojos se cristalizaban por las lágrimas. – Duele tanto, Alex. Tenerte cerca y al mismo tiempo no poder tenerte como quiero… ¿Porqué no puedes elegirme? - Las cosas son así, Josh. ¿Por qué no te buscas otra chica que no te vaya a herir? – era una mentirosa. Yo no podía estar bien sabiendo que él estaba con alguien más. Era egoísta pero en este momento necesitaba disminuir su dolor. Giró y dio un puñetazo en la pared y luego reposó su frente. Suspiró y luego giró para enfrentarme. - Porque te amo, maldita sea. Algo dentro de mí quería que le respondiera: \"Yo también\", pero sabía que no era así. No podía ser así, simplemente era atracción y sentimientos enredados. Sus ojos exigieron una respuesta que no estaba dispuesta a darle. Cerró sus ojos y volvió a abrirlos revelándome su alma llena de dolor y resignación. Tomó mi mano y me llevó de regreso a la fiesta en silencio. Me dejó con Avan quien trataba de entretenerme pero no podía quitar mis ojos de Josh quien iba de mesa en mesa tomando todo el licor. Estuve a punto de correr un millón de veces cada vez que lo veía tropezar. Estaba ebrio. Me atrapó mirándolo. Fue hacia el DJ y hablo con él. Luego se acercó a mí, caminando con dificultad. Me tomó del brazo y me llevo hacia el improvisado escenario. Fue un poco brusco. Me pasó un micrófono. - Yo también quiero un cierre- dijo empujándome al centro. Observe que casi todos los invitados estaban en el estado de Josh. Él consiguió otro micrófono e hizo una señal para que la música comenzara. Mi corazón se estrujó cuando escuché la canción. Él esperaba que la cante, pero la letra solo haría que mi dolor aumentara junto con el suyo. Tal vez eso era lo que él quería, que sienta su dolor. (Say Something - A Great Big World & Christina Aguilera: www_youtube_com/watch?v=BZxUv3y1LYU ) Say something I'm giving up on you (Di algo que estoy renunciando a ti) I'll be the one if you want me too (Yo seré el único si me quieres también) anywhere I would have followed you (en cualquier lugar te hubiera seguido) Say something I'm giving up on you (Di algo que estoy renunciando a ti) Aunque no quiera admitirlo una parte de mi corazón es completamente suyo. Él no entiende que no es fácil para mí. Me duele hacerle daño, porque también el daño me causa dolor. And I am feeling so small (Y me siento tan pequeño) it was over my head (estaba sobre mi cabeza) I know nothing at all (No sé nada en absoluto) And I will stumble and fall (Y voy a tropezar y caer) I'm still learning to love (Todavía estoy aprendiendo a amar) just starting to crawl (apenas comenzando a gatear) Cada palabra se sentía como una punzada en mi alma. Puede que nadie mas no preste atención pero no importaba. Era el momento de Josh de decir lo que siente. Me lo dicho con palabras, pero escucharlo cantar es mil veces más doloroso y profundo. Say something I'm giving up on you (Di algo que estoy renunciando a ti) I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you (Lo siento que no podría llegar a usted) anywhere I would have followed you (en cualquier lugar te hubiera seguido) Say something I'm giving up on you (Di algo que estoy renunciando a ti) De sus ojos se escapaban lágrimas. Mientras seguía cantando pase mis dedos por sus mejillas para secarlas. Me sujetó de los hombros para fijar nuestras miradas. And I will swallow my pride (Y voy a tragarme mi orgullo) You're the one that I love (Tú eres el único a quien amo) and I'm saying goodbye (y estoy diciendo adiós) Say something I'm giving up on you (Di algo que estoy renunciando a ti) I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you (Lo siento que no podría llegar a usted) anywhere I would have followed you (en cualquier lugar te hubiera seguido) Say something I'm giving up on you (Di algo que estoy renunciando a ti) Say something... (Di algo...) Ambos teníamos lágrimas. Él se apartó de mí y se alejó. Lo vi tropezarse y corrí tras de él. Se encontraba tirado en el suelo sin poder ponerse de pie. Trate de levantarlo sin éxito, él no colaboraba. Unos brazos lo tomaron por sus costados y lograron ponerle de pie. Reconocí a Liam. No lo había visto en toda la noche. - Gracias. - Creo que somos los únicos sobrios. Un gusto en conocerte, Alexandra. - Igualmente. Parece que todo mundo me conoce. - Eso es porque Josh no deja de hablar de ti. – Miré a Josh que a duras penas se mantenía de pie y que balbuceaba sonidos incoherentes. – Vamos. Pueden quedarse en la cabaña que me asignaron. Luego buscare a Jennifer y me quedaré en su cabaña. - ¿Nuestra cabaña? - Creo que Jenn pensó que Josh y tú se quedarían juntos. – dijo moviendo las cejas de una manera sugestiva. - Ni siquiera debería enojarme. Será mejor que lo recostemos. Llevamos a Josh a rastras hasta una de las cabañas. Solo constaba de una habitación con su propio baño. Logramos dejarlo en la cama. - Espero que puedas descansar. Cualquier cosa que necesites me buscas – dijo Liam junto a la puerta. - Creo que lo tengo controlado. Gracias. – Liam cerró la puerta cuando se fue. Me volví para encontrarme con Josh sobre la única cama, con sus brazos y piernas extendidas y su mirada perdida en el techo. Solté un suspiro de resignación y decidí que por hoy dormiríamos juntos. No es algo que no haya pasado en otra ocasión. El alcohol impregnaba su ropa así que empecé a tirar de su playera. —Tú eres hermosa, Alexandra. – su mirada esta fija en mí. —Y tú estás muy ebrio. – repliqué mientras luchaba con su ropa. —Pero no miento, créeme. Eres la chica más bella, hermosa, dulce, fantástica e impresionante del mundo. – su mirada era dulce aunque su ceño era serio. —Ya basta, Josh… - dije luchando ahora con sus zapatos. Estiró su mano y sujetó un rizo de mi cabello enredándolo en su dedo. —Tu cabello es hermoso, también. Cuando se riega como cortina en mi almohada yo… pierdo el control. En medio de toda mi frustración por este día me reí. Él estiro sus manos hacia mí y las coloco en mi cadera haciendo que mi cuerpo se deslizara sobre el suyo. Estaba tan ebrio que dudo mucho que recuerde algo de este día. — ¿Intentas seducirme con halagos, Josh?- trabajaba en el botón de su pantalón. —Definitivamente no voy a seducirte, eso quedo bastante claro. No lo he logrado antes, mucho menos ahora. Los halagos solo se me escaparon, fue como pensar en voz alta y ambos sabemos lo que pienso de ti. —¿Entonces estamos en el momento de las confesiones? – empecé a tirar de su pantalón para que se meta en la cama. —Deberías decirme algo también para sentirme menos estúpido y rechazado. No sabes cómo duele sentirse así. —Tú eres… sexy. – dije mientras tiraba de las mantas para cubrirlo - Probablemente te dejaría seducirme si no estuvieras tan ebrio. — ¿Me dejarías? —Es lo que has hecho estos últimos meses y ambos sabemos que has logrado mucho. —Soy más divertido y audaz cuando estoy ebrio. Deberías dejarme seducirte ahora. —Lo que deberíamos hacer ahora es dormir. Mañana vas a despertar con un terrible dolor de cabeza y yo necesito descanso para enfrentarme a tu mal humor. – No podría tener mal humor si me despierto y te encuentro a mi lado. – sonreí con sus dulces palabras mientras me desvestía. Debería tener más recelo pero a fin de cuentas Josh me había visto desnuda muchas veces. Me metí bajo las sabanas solo con mi top y mis bragas. – Duerme pequeño – dije acariciando su frente. Sus ojos estaban fijos en mi rostro. – Quiero estar contigo, cada día, como ahora. – Sabes que no podemos. – suspiré resignada. – La vida es tan injusta a veces – sus manos se envolvieron atrayéndome más a su cuerpo - ¿Sabes lo interesante del amor? – Nop. – Nunca crees realmente que existe hasta que llega y entonces conoces a una persona y tu vida cambia para siempre. Lo ideal sería que consiguieras ser feliz. – Algún día serás feliz, Josh. Ahora debes dormir. – Agitó su cabeza en negación - ¿Te sientes mejor? – Estoy bien – escondió su rostro en mi cuello. – ¿Crees que puedas dormir? – Eso depende de ti. – susurró. Su aliento en mi piel me hacía estremecer. – ¿Depende de qué? – De si me vas a dejar besarte esta noche. Dudé por un segundo. Debería decirle que después de todo lo sucedido no deberíamos, pero no quería entrar en conflicto y además también quería ese beso – ¿Solo un beso? – Me conoces mejor que nadie, Alex. Besarte nunca es suficiente, pero por hoy me conformaré. Sus labios se amoldaron a los míos en un tímido beso que no exigía más a diferencia de los otros que nos hemos dado. Terminó muy rápido para mi gusto. Josh se aferró a mi cuerpo y luego de un momento su respiración se volvió calmada indicando que se había dormido. Otra vez decidí huir de mis pensamientos, pero sabría que llegaría la hora de enfrentarme a la realidad y atenerme a la consecuencia de mis actos. Hooooola :) Lo siento x no actualizar el domingo pero en ultimo momento decidí q el cap no tenía mucha emoción y decidí juntar dos par terminar la escena. tambien me di cuenta que no había hecho un cap musical en mucho. :D Creo q ya están cansadas de esas arremetidas deluno con el otro... escenas de besos que no llevan a nada.. pero creanme que ya se acabaran.. solo quería poner a Alex en la situación. Quería que ella baje sus defensas, se deje llevar y llegue a dudar.. tanto que no quiere analizar sus sentimientos.. pero como dije llegará el momento en que tenga que enfrentarlo aunq falta muchos caps para ello. Los próximos 2 caps quizas les emocione... para mi son difíciles escribirlos pero tratare hacerlo el fin de semana :D Ya tengo mi esquema de la historia pero la verdad no esperaba que fuera tannnn larga. pero como dije aun no tengo la capacidad de los escritores de resumir millones de cosas en un cap.. necesito 5 x ello :P Espero sus reviews y gracias a los que siguen dejándolos. Espero leerlos y en verdad saber que creen q pasara.. hay ciertas cosas q deje sueltas en los anteriores caps pero pronto volveran y quizas me odien x ello xq llegaran cuando menos se esperan :/ Espero actualizar los mas pronto.. no habrá avance xq no tengo nada en el nuevo cap... lo lamento :) -Nos leemos luego .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET[Chapter 93] Capítulo 93 – No debería ayudarte. Me matará si se da cuenta. – No lo hará, tranquilo. – Si no resulta debes cumplir lo que prometiste. Lo hago solo por eso. – Es mi última oportunidad, Peter. Ella no va a reconocer lo que siente. Necesito ese tiempo para demostrarle lo perfecto que somos juntos sin tener a Darío de por medio. Te juro que si ella no me elije me olvidaré de ella. Me alejaré aunque eso me cueste la vida. – Solo quiero que esta situación se resuelva lo más pronto posible, pero si ella de entera que te ayude en esto, me odiará. – Si ella sospecha o se da cuenta que planeé todo, asumiré la culpa. Ni siquiera te nombraré. – ie tranquilizándolo. – Eso espero. Suerte. – Gracias Peter. Corté la llamada. En verdad estaba agradecido por su ayuda. Todo lo que dije era una absoluta verdad. Si esto no funcionaba renunciaría completamente a ella. Desde mi cumpleaños las cosas se habían tornado insoportables. Ella se había ido en algún momento en la madrugada. He intentado hablar con ella pero no me lo permite. Se muestra distante y no me dirige mas que las palabras necesarias y una sonrisa cortez. Casi no la he visto. Evita quedarse a solas conmigo. si tenemos que trabajar en algun proyecto, ella envía por correo lo que ha avanzado y me pide que lo complete o revise. Evita encontrarse conmigo poniendo estúpidas excusas. No puedo soportar su indiferencia. Esa sonrisa triste que me ofrece cuando me ve. Necesito que acepte sus sentimientos por mí. No puedo dejar que siga evadiendo y mientiendose a sí misma sobre lo que siente. Parte de mí la entiende. Estar con su novio es de cierta forma seguro. Ella lo quiere pero estoy seguro de que no lo ama y necesito mostrarle eso en un lugar donde el resto del mundo no interfiera en sus razones. Si luego de esto ella no me elie, ya no habría nada mas que hacer. No puedopasarme la vida confundiendole y haciendome daño. Por lo menos hoy no puede escaparse. Pasaré por ella ya que debemos ir a una cena para firmar lo papeles necesarios para un nuevo convenio. Debemos firmar los tres: Alex, Collins y yo. espere por mas de 20 minutos en el estacionemiento antes de ir a buscarla. Pregunté en recepción por ella y terminé en el area oncológica. Podía imaginarme en quien se había entretenido. Cierto angelito compite conmigo por su atención. Estaba sentada en la cama de Sammy con ella en un brazo y en el otro con un libro. Me acerqué lentamente y escuché el relato que leía. \"Te amo\" - dijo el principito... -\"Yo también te quiero\" - dijo la rosa. -\"No es lo mismo\"- respondió él... \"Amar es la confianza plena de que pase lo que pase vas a estar, no porque me debas nada, no con posesión egoísta, sino estar, en silenciosa compañía. Amar es saber que no te cambia el tiempo, ni las tempestades, ni mis inviernos. Amar es darte un lugar en mi corazón para que te quedes como padre, madre, hermano, hijo, amigo y saber que en el tuyo hay un lugar para mí. Dar amor no agota el amor, por el contrario, lo aumenta. La manera de devolver tanto amor, es abrir el corazón y dejarse amar.\" -\"Ya entendí\" - dijo la rosa. - \" No lo entiendas, vívelo\" - agregó el principito. - ¿Es verdad, Alex? – preguntó Sammy. - ¿Qué cosa pequeña? - Amar a alguien es así de grande. - Pues sí, cuando te enamores de alguien lo entenderas. - ¿Has amado de esa manera, Alex? – mi chica asintió con mirada triste - ¿Cómo se llama? Ansiaba esuchar su repsuesta. Esperaba que sus labios digan mi nombre, pero Sammy me vio antes de que mi niña pueda responder. – Josh. - Hola princesa – dije besando su frente. Luego mire a Alex. – Hola. - Hola – respondió. - ¿Alguna vez haz amado a alguien, Josh? – la inocente pregunta de Sammy hizo que mi corazón se partiera. Alex se puso de pie rapidamente. - Ahora regreso. Voy por mi bolso para que podamos irnos. – dijo saliendo de la habitación. - Si. He amado y aún amo mucho a una persona. - Escuché a mi prima decirle a su amiga que el amor duele. ¿Es cierto? – preguntó preocupada. - En ocasiones. - No debería doler. ¿El amor te ha hecho sufrir? – sus pregutnas aunque inocentes estaban cavando mas en la llaga de mi corazón. Asentí. - ¿Si sabías que te iba doler, lo hubieras evitado? Pensé por un largo momento en mi respuesta. – Creo que si alguien me hubiera advertido que dolía el enamorarse, hubiera hecho lo posible por evitar enamorarme de ella. Pero eso es una completa mentira. La habría amado de todas formas. – lo digo ms para mí que para ella. Eso hizo que sonríera – Alex y tú son lindos cuando están juntos. ¿Se aman? Quisiera decirle que sí. Pero era exactamento lo que pensaba averiguar. Decidí cambiar de tema cuando vi a Alex acercandose. – Ya conseguí tu regalo de navidad. - ¿Qué es? – pregunto emocionada brincando sobre la cama. - No te lo puedo decir. Será una sorpresa. - Pero yo no te he regalado nada. - ¿Sabes que regalo me gustaría que me hicieras? – ella asintió – Un beso en la mejilla. Envolvió sus bracitos en mi cuello y posó sus labios en mi mejilla. - ¿Qué les ha regalado a Josh? – preguntó a Alex – Él vino por ti en medio de este frío. Pudo haberse enfermado. - Supongo que tendré que pensarlo y conseguirle algo – concedió Alex. - Pero te iras en 2 días y no verás a Josh. Deberías darle un beso en la mejilla, también. - Tal vez podría pensar en otra cosa – contestó Alex con un rostro lleno de molestia. - Alex me llevará mañana a jugar en un parque. Consiguió permiso para que me dejen salir. Es mi regalo. Todo un día conmigo. – la pequeña saltó emocionada. - Me gustaría que me regalaras lo que le darás a Sammy – dije entusiasmado, pensando en la posibilidad de tener todo un día con ella. - Me quedo con el beso – dijo tratando de sonreír pero dandome una mirada mordaz. - Que mas podría pedir por navidad que un beso de dos damos preciosas. Alex se acercó a mi lentamente y sus labios tocaron mi mejilla. Moría por girarme y atrapar su boca con la mía. No lo hice, tendría que ser paciente. - ¿Ustedes se aman? – preungtó Sammy. Ambos nos quedamos helado. - Somos amigos – dijo Alex. – Nos tenemos que ir. Nos vemos mañana pequeña. - ¿Puede venir Josh con nosotros, Alexa? Me estudió por un momento pero no se negó. Ambos nos despedimos con un beso de Samantha antes de salir. Llegamos al estacionamiento en completo silencio. Por alguna razón quería ese beso que no le di antes. De un solo movimiento le acorralé contra la pared. - ¿Somos solo amigos? – susurré en su cuello. Como siempre, ella se estremeción bajo mi tacto. - Amigos. Eso es todo. – dijo nerviosa. Sonreí ante su reacción. Me acerque a sus labios y mordí el inferior provocandole un gemido. – Amigos a quienes les gusta hacer esto – volví a morder sus labios. Dos minutos mas tarde ella me empujó y no pude hacer otra cosa mas que sonreír por su disgusta. Puede que este enojada conmigo pero creo que esta mas cabreada consigo misma por dejarse llevar. - ¿Por qué sigues haciendo esto, Josh? - ¿Qué quieres decir? – traté de acorralarla nuevamente. - No puedes seguir haciendo esto. No puedo fingir que somo amigos si sigues besandome, tentandomé. Para, Joshua. No mas besos, no mas caricias, no mas tocarme. Esto no es usto para mí. ¿tienes…. Alguna idea de lo loca que me estoy volviendo? ¿tienes una maldita idea de lo confundida que estoy? Eso era exactamente lo que quería. - ¿Te vuelvo loca ahora? ¿Estás confundida ahora? - Basta, Josh. Para. Esto debe terminarse. - Esto no sucedería si no tuvieras dudas. Si me correspondes es porque sientes algo. Si te vuelvo loca es porque me permites entrar en ti. Admite lo que sientes, Alexandra. Me miró irritada – Si sigues haciendome esto yo no… no podemos ser amigos. - No es una buena razón para parar. Tú bien sabes que no quiero ser solo tu amigo. Quiero mas. Quiero todo de ti. Alex… No puedo vivir sin ti… - Si que puedes… lo has hecho, Josh. - Si, pero no quiero. – grité exasperado. - Pues esto es un ultimatúm. O lo tomas o lo dejas. Decidi dejarlo ahí. Pronto tendría respuestas. Cumplimos con nuestro horario del día. Ella no permitió que la llevara a su departamento, la deje porque tendrá que lidiar conmigo al siguiente día. Cuando llegué al hospital, Alex ya estaba con Sammy esperandonos. Decidimos ir por comida, ensalda de frutas, lo mas saludable para Sammy. Luego la pequeña nos pidió que le llevemos a un parque. Fuimos a uno que por suerte estaba vacío, asi que la pequeña podría disfrutar plenamente. Apenas bajó del auto se echó a correr hacia la resbaladilla. - Vengan – nos gritó. Miré a Alex quien se veía feliz contemplado a la pequeña. Su felicidad era contagiosa. - ¿Vamos? – le pregunté. -Atrápame si puedes – dijo golpeando mi pecho y corriendo tan rápido como pudo antes de que pudiera darme cuenta de lo que estaba pasando. -No lo creo pequeña – grité corriendo tras ella. La alcancé en medio camino levantando en mis brazos. Nos hice girar y recosté en el suelo poniéndome a horcajadas sobre ella haciéndole cosquillas sin piedad. Su risa era muy fuerte. Casi no podía respirar. – Basta me haré pis, Josh.- dijo agitadamente. -Te lo mereces, pequeña tramposa – miré a Sammy quien había entrado en aquellos juegos de túneles dejándonos fuera de vista. Antes de que pudiera reacciona, estampe mis labios sobre los suyos, era otros de esos besos que se desataban últimamente, apasionado y creciente como un incendio. Nos separamos por falta de aire, ambos estábamos sonrojados y no sabíamos que decir para romper la tensión. Como siempre ella me correspondía. Pensar que apenas anoche estaba haciendo un gran problema de ello. Era por eso que no podía dejar de luchar por ella. Aun podía tenerla solo debía ser paciente y tener esperanza. ¿Quién podía fingir este tipo de entrega hacia una persona, que dice no sentir más que amistad? No dijo nada luego, ni siquiera me reclamó por el beso. Dejamos a Sammy en el hospital y luego la lleve a su departamento. Estacione frente a su puerta, apagando el motor de mi auto. Ambos nos quedamos en silencio. - Nos vemos luego de año nuevo – dijo sujetanto la manija de la puerta. - ¿No me darás regalo de navidad? - El beso en la mejilla era tu regalo. ¿Quieres algo mas? - Quiero uno en los labios. - Ja – bufó – creo que has conseguido muchos de esos, ultimamente. - Quiero un beso que tú inicies. No uno que te viste obligada a corresponder. – era llo que mas deseaba. - No. - ¿No? - No. – dijo cruzando sus brazos sobre su pecho – Si seguimos de esa manera no se a donde vamos a parar. - Yo tampoco lo sé, pero no me importa. Es lo que quiero ahora, me vale mierda el futuro. - No nos veremos en un par de días, necesito que pienses lo que quieres. – Si supiera mi plan. - Lo haré, si tú lo haces. – dije seriamente – Por favor, Alex. Estarás lejos de tu novio, necesito que pienses en mí. Tu mejor que nadie sabe lo felices que somos juntos, aun tenemos esa chispa y sé que puedes amarme. - No puedo hacerle eso a Darío. – dijo mirando sus manos. Pero su respuesto me esperanzo mas porque por primera vez admitió la posibilidad o él hecho de que estar conmigo no es descabellado. Nuestra mayor dificultad es su novio. - Pero tampoco puedes mentirle. Él merece a una persona que lo ame y que su corazón no piense en otra persona. Y tu mereces estar con la persona correcta. - Mi corazón es solo suyo – dijo furiosa pero al mismo tiempo su voz engendraba duda. – Adios, Josh. Sostuve su brazo. – ¿Lo pensarás? - Lo pensaré. Un día despues, la veía abordar su vuelo a Aspen donde pasaría navidad y año nuevo con Peter quien nunca llegará porque cancelarán su vuelo. Yo de \"casualidad\" tambien me quedaré en Aspen y como soy tan buen amigo, disfrutaré con ella estas fechas para no sentirnos solos. Le mostraré lo feliz que podemos ser juntos. Es mi pultimo esfuerzo porque ya no tengo fuerzas para seguir luchando contra ella. Me hace daño ver que mis itnentos se va por la borda. Abordé en el último segundo. Peter fue quien consiguió asientos para ambos que obviamente estaban uno junto al otro. Estaba listo para enfrentarme con su disgusto. Pero cuando llegué me encontré con mi niña dormida. Ella y su maldita manía de dormir durante los vuelos. Me acomodé a su lado y con cuidado retire su cinturon de seguridad y tiré de su cuerpo al mío enredandola en mis brazos. Creí que despertaría, pero no lo hizo. Me llené de calidez sentirla de ese manera. Un gran suspiro salió de sus labios , acompañado de mi nombre. No pudé evitar besar su frente deseando que ese susurró no haya sido parte de mi imaginación. Debí haberme quedado dormido en algú momento. Desperté cuando la sentí apartarse de mis brazos bruscamente. Abrí los ojos y me encontré con su mirada furiosa. - ¿Qué mierda haces aquí? – preguntó. Que empiece la guerra. Hooola a todos...! Espero q no me hayan extrañado mucho..! ¿Que les pareció? Josh esta competamente decidido. ¿Cómo creen que piensa en recuperarla? Bueno les diré que el próximo cap es el q les he venido prometiendo. Gracias a todos x seguir leyendo aun.. la verdad no se como es que la historia se volvio taaaaan larga, pero realmente espero q lean hasta el final :) Gracias x sus reviews y espero q sigan dejandolos..! amo leerlos.. me hace querer seguir escribiendo..! Días antes leí un review y en verdad estaba muy preocupada. Luego relaí toda la historia y me di cuenta que no debería importarme. Me decía qu estaba creando una Mary-Sue en . le de lo que se tratab y pensé que había cometido muchos errores si esa era la impresión que daba de mis personajes.. pero cuando releí todo me di cuenta que es absurdo pensar eso. Nadie es perfecto y no pretendo hacer a un personaje perfecto ni reflajr lo que yo quisiera ser en él. La historia la empecé xq una amiga me convenció no para reflejar ningun deseo oculto de mi personalidad. Ademas no pienso que mis personajes sean perectos especialmente \"Aex\" es obvio que desde el punto de vista de Josh será todo ideal porque está enamorado, pero yo creo que Alex es una persona insegura, orgullosa, cabeza hueca, egoíast, que muchas veces no está dispuesta reconocer errores o enfrentar sus miedos y a que ademas necesita estar con una persona para snetirse amada. No le veo la perfección. Y si dice que es de las típicas que todas aman pues bueno la version es contada desde su punto de vista, ella se rodeara de persona quienes le aprecian. Siempre se quejan de que las historia son las típicas de la niña rica perfecta que tiene q bajarse de las nubes o de la chica pobre o nerd que encuentra un chico y descibre q es bonita y popular. esa nuna fue mi idea, quise formular un personaje normal, con todos sus defectos y virtudes, y quizas exagere un poco con la historia de sus enfermedad y que ahora tiene dinero y q quiere ayudar a los demas. y es es xq quiero hacerlo xq tuve a una amiga q falleció con lecucemia y ella decía que si vivia haría lo posible por ayudar a los demas. Bueno.. eso era todo lo que quería decir.. espero que sigan leyendo y a las personas que no les guste pues les invitó a no seguir la historia. nadie les obliga..! :) Gracias x todo.. nos leemos luego :-.-.-.-.-.- MILET AVANCE: - En realidad quisiera saber porque estas vestido como si estuvieras listo para descansar en lugar de usar ropa adecuada para el clima que tendras que enfrentar. - Porque es lo que pienso hacer. Espero que lo que estes preparando sea chocolate. Amo ver peliculas tomando chocolate. - ¿Perdón? – estaba empezando a enojarme nuevamente – Luego del chocolate, te largas. - No puedo. - ¿Qué se supone significa eso? - No puedo. Cuando fui por mi ropa trate de abrir la puerta del garage y no cedía. Puedes mirar por la venta y ver que la ventisca ha levantado un muro de nieve por lo que la puerta no cede. Y por lo visto la nieve no va a para. Asi que estoy atrapado aquí.[Chapter 94] Capítulo 94 No había dormido toda la noche. Mi mente iba y regresaba a un mismo punto. Josh. No podía sacarlo de mí. No podía dejar de pensar en él comoalgo mas que amigo. No podía quitarme la sensación de sus labios y sus caricias de mi piel. No podía apartarlo. Me levanté al mismo tiempo que mi novio. Él y mis amigos partían hacia nuestra tierra a pasar las fiestas. Yo había prometido quedarme con Peter en la casa de Aspen y mi vuelo salía mas tarde asi que aun tenía tiempo de empacar. Me despedí de los chicos. Realmente los iba a extrañar pero no podía dejar a mi hermano solo. Hice mis maletas y partí hacia el aeropuerto. Creo que me quede dormida un par de veces en la sala de espera. La mala noche me pasaba factura. Apenas mi cabeza tocó el asiento me sumí en un sueño profundo. Cuando despertaba, todo en mí se sentía tan cómodo y relajado como hace mucho no había sucedido. Para ser mas específica, eso solía suceder cuando dormía con Josh. Cuando abrí los ojos me encontré con un rostro conocido que oslo me hizo aferrarme a él por unos segundos mas hasta que el conocimiento llegué a mi y me de cuenta que esto no debería estar pasando. Me aperté rapidamente de sus brazos. Estaba furiosa. Él no debería estar aquí. Abrió sus ojos sorprendido. – ¿Qué mierda haces aquí? — Hola – dijo frotándose los ojos. – Alguien despertó de mal humor. —Estoy a un segundo de golpearte y gritar. – en serio lo haría. —No entiendo porqué. – dijo haciendose el desentendido. —¿No vas a responderme? —Si hablas del hecho que ambos coincidieramos en el mismo vuelo no dejaré que me eches la culpa. Yo solo abordé y te vi. negocié con tu vecino de asiento para cambiar de lugar. Pensé que te alegraría viajar con un amigo. —Algo me dice que no te crea. – esa sonrisa en su rostro no me daba confianza. —¿En qué soñabas? —No cambies de tema, Josh. Algo aquí huele muy mal. —Te juro que me bañe. Vamos, Alex. Tu mejor que nadie sabe que las casualidades existen. Ademas yo no sabía que vendrías a Aspen. Según yo, tu viajabas con tus amigos. Iría con mi familia, pero ellos viajaron donde mis abuelos. Aspen es un muy buen lugar para vacacionar. ¿No me dirás que soñabas? Aun no confiaba en él pero tenía un punto. Nadie mas que mis amigos, Peter y mi familia sabian de este viaje. Decidí relajarme por un momento. —No lo recuerdo. —Dijiste mi nombre. – aseguró sonriendo. En algun momento sus manos habían llegado a parar en mi cintura provocando un creciente calor en mi cuerpo. — ¿De verdad? Espera ya recuerdo. Tuve un sueño realmente estupendo. — ¿Ah, sí? – preguntó acercandose a mí. Con su mirada fija en mis labios. Si seguía acercandose de esa manera volveremos a caer en nuestro círculo vicioso. —Sí, ha sido el mejor funeral al que he asistido. Empezó a reir contra mi cuello. Su aliento hacía que me estremezca. Tenía que apartarse pronto. Ya sabía que yo no podái hacerlo. —No creo que soñaras con mi funeral. —Digo en voz baja. —En realidad creo que tenías un sueño erótico conmigo. Ahora yo reía —Estás loco. Lo último que soñaría es a nosotros en esa situación. Y para invalidar mi punto, Josh dio un mordisco en mi cuello haciendome gemir. Es obvio que nosotros en esa situación es exactamente lo que mi cuerpo pide. —Requerimos el uso de sus cinturones de seguridad para el aterrizaje. Gracias por usar nuestros servicios, esperamos que hayan tenido un viaje placentero y que su estadía sea de la misma manera. Felices Fiestas. – dijeron por altavoces. Ambos nos separamos e hicimos lo que nos pidieron. Aterrizamos y desembarcamos. Ambos fuimos por nuestros equipajes. Quise apartarme de Josh todo el tiempo pero él siempre estuvo a mi lado siguiendome. Salí por la puerta principal y trate de detener un taxi sin éxito. El clima era pésimo. Estaba nevando y los únicos taxis que llegaban habían sido pedidos con anticipación. Dedí haber pensando en eso. – Si dejaras de ignorarme nos hubieramos ido hace 20 minutos. Hace frío. - ¿Te das cuenta que no hay un maldito taxi? - Seeeee. Siempre debes llamar para reservar uno. - Supongo que tienes uno. –dije rodando los ojos. - En realidad alquilé un auto que debe estar en el estacionamiento. Me entregaron las llaves en información. Puedo llevarte. - No gracias. Prefiero esperar. - Prefieres morirte de frío que aceptar mi ayuda. Que madura eres. – su comentario me hizo enojar aun mas. - Vale. Vamos entonces. Su maldita sonrisa de satisfacción apareción en su rostro. Me quitó mi maleta y empezó a camianr hacia el estacionamiento. Lo seguí hasta el auto que había alquilado. Colocó nuestro equipaje en el portamaletas y se acercó a abrir la puerta del copiloto. Dejé escapar un bufido antes de sentarme y colocarme el cinturon de seguridad. Salimos del aeropuerto. El tiempo realmente era malo. Nevaba mucho y había viento. Avanzamos lentamente por la vía. - ¿Tienes la dirección? – le mostré mi celular donde tenía todos los datos de la casa de Peter, bueno tambien era mía. – Bien. Conozco donde es. Asentí. - ¿No vas a hablarme? – ignoré su pregunta. Encendió la radio. Iba cambiando de estación a otra hasta encontrar una con señal clara. Paró en una cuando la canción de coldplay empezaba. Josh empezó acantarla. Pude ver que me miraba de reojo. (Yellow – Coldplay: www_youtube_com/watch?v=QCS5Ib5fPgc ) Look at the stars, (Mira las estrellas) Look how they shine for you,(Mira como brillan por ti) And everything you do,(Y todo lo que haces) Yeah, they were all yellow. (Si, ellas eran todas amarillas) I came along, (Yo vine) I wrote a song for you, (Escribí una canción para ti) And all the things you do, (Y todas las cosas que haces) And it was called \"Yellow.\" (Y fue llamada \"Amarillo\") So then I took my turn, (Así que luego tomé mi turno) Oh what a thing to've done, (Oh que cosa para haber hecho? And it was all yellow. Y fue llamada Amarillo) Your skin (Tu piel) Oh yeah, your skin and bones, (Oh sí, tu piel y huesos) Turn into something beautiful, (Se conviertieron en algo hermoso) And you know (y tu sabes) You know I love you so, (Sabes que te amo tanto) You know I love you so. (Tú sabes que te amo tanto) Mientras sonaba el estribillo, Josh me miró. – No seas amargada, Alexandra. Amas la canción y mueres por cantarla. Hazlo. – Con el ritmo empezó a hacer movimeintos ridículos con su cabeza y su cuerpo. No pude evitar reír. Era facil contagiarse de su humor. Dejé mi enfado de un lado y empecé a cantar con él. I swam across, (nadé al otro lado) I jumped across for you, (Salté de un lado a otro por ti) Oh what a thing to do. (Oh que cosa para hacer) Cuz you were all yellow. (Porque eras toda amarilla.) Ambos cantabamos a todo pulmón. I drew a line, (dibujé una linea) I drew a line for you, (Dibujé una línea para ti) Oh what a thing to do, (Oh que cosa para hacer) And it was all yellow. (Y era toda amarilla) Your skin (Tu piel) Oh yeah, your skin and bones, (Oh sí, tu piel y huesos) Turn into something beautiful, (Se conviertieron en algo hermoso) And you know (y tu sabes) For you I'd bleed myself dry, (Por ti me desangraría) For you I'd bleed myself dry. (Por ti me desangraría) It's true, look how they shine for you, (Es verdad, mira como brillan para ti) Look how they shine for you, (Mira como brillan para ti) Look how they shine for... (Mira como brilla) Look how they shine for you, (Mira como brillan para ti) Look how they shine for you, (Mira como brillan para ti) Look how they shine... (Mira como brilla) Look at the stars, (Mira las estrellas) Look how they shine for you,(Mira como brillan por ti) And all the things that you do. (Y todo lo que haces) Era inevitable tener estos momentos con Josh. Era un salto al pasado, a esas épocas en la nos conocimosy disfrutabamos de una canción. Tenía que admitir que con Josh no era necesario besos y caricias para atraerme o desatarmis sentimientos; eran estos momentos los que me hacían dudar sobre mis decisiones, estos pequeños detalles con los que me sentía en el lugar mas feliz del mundo. A pesar del clima y de nuestro lento avance llegamos a la dirección. Pude ver la casa sobre la colina rodeada de una gran cerramiento y una gran puerta. La ventisca había aumentado. - Gracias por traerme – dije a Josh. Iba abrir la puerta, sujeté mi abrigo lista ara enfrentarme a la ventisca. - Alto ahí. No se te ocurra bajar. - ¿Cómo se supone que entre? – pregunté. – Tengo que ingresar el código en el panel junto a la entrada. - Dámelo. - Josh.. - Dámelo – repitió. Rodé los ojos y se lo di. Josh se bajó del auto y corrió hacia la entrada. Debio ingresar el código porque la puerta empezó a abrirse. – Dios. Hace un frío tremendo. - Pude haberme quedado aquí. - Estas loca. Tienes casi 200 metros que caminar. Habrías muerto congelada. – Josh avanzó por el camino de entrada. Había un garaje a un lado de la csas que estaba cerrado. Intenté bajarme pero Josh corrió y la puerta se elevó permitiendonos ingresar en él. Inmediatamente despues la puerta se cerró. Cuando me bajé sentí el frío filtrarse a pesar de que la puerta estaba cerrada. Me apresuré en busca de las llaves que Peter me había dado para abrir la puerta que deba a la parte interior de la casa. Josh entró con mi equipaje detrás de mí. Me apresuré a buscar la calefacción de la casa y la encendí. No había conocido esta casa pero debo decir que tiene un ambiente rústico muy acogedor. Una sala con una gran chimenea, una terraza donde apreció un jacuzzi, 3 habitaciones, cocina. - Me recuerda a cierta cabaña… - dijo Josh en voz baja. Seguí su mirada a la alfombra frente a la chimenea y llegue al entendimiento de su comentario. La cabaña donde nos habíamos entregados por primera vez era demasiado parecida. Bloqueé rapidamente los recuerdos que llegaban a mi mente, no podía pensar en eso en estos momentos. - Deberías cambiarte de ropa antes de que te marches. Te prepararé algo caliente. – practicamente le castañeaban los dientes. Peter había encargado a las personas que hacía la limpieza llenar la despensa con todo lo necesario. Josh buscó un parad de ropa en el auto, tomó una ducha. Como si mis hormonas no estuvieran exaltadas, tuvo que aparecerse solo con un pantalón de chandal, descalzo y mojada. Todo su torso desnudo brillaba por las gotas que se deslizaban con sus movimientos. Él frotaba su cabeza con la toalla tratando de secar su cabella. Literalmente empezaba a babear. - ¿Te gusta lo que ves? – preguntó guiñandome un ojo. - En realidad quisiera saber porque estas vestido como si estuvieras listo para descansar en lugar de usar ropa adecuada para el clima que tendras que enfrentar. - Porque es lo que pienso hacer. Espero que lo que estes preparando sea chocolate. Amo ver peliculas tomando chocolate. - ¿Perdón? – estaba empezando a enojarme nuevamente – Luego del chocolate, te largas. - No puedo. - ¿Qué se supone significa eso? - No puedo. Cuando fui por mi ropa trate de abrir la puerta del garage y no cedía. Puedes mirar por la ventana y ver que la ventisca ha levantado un muro de nieve por lo que la puerta no cede. Y por lo visto la nieve no va a parar. Asi que estoy atrapado aquí. Me acerqué a la ventana para confirmar lo que Josh había dicho. Evidentemente había un gran muro de nieve contra la puerta. Golpeé mi frente contra la ventana. Esto no podía estar sucediendo. Por suerte el teléfono de la casa sonó. Corrí a contestar. - ¿Alex? - Oh. Peter. Gracias a Dios. ¿Estás ya en el aeropuerto? – necesitaba urgentemente no ser la única atrapada con Josh. - Mmm. Tengo malas noticias. Cancelaron mi vuelo por el tiempo y no estan seguros de cuando volvera a la normalidad. Consulte en información y me dijo que realmente no tenga esperanzas por en estas épocas generalmente se cancelan todos los viajes por las grandes ventiscas. No sabes lo mal que me siento Alex. Evité que viajes con los chicos y te quedaras atrapada en esa casa sola en noche buena y no se cuantos días mas. Lo siento tanto. Estoy tratando de comunicarme con los encargados de la casa para que se puedan quedar contigo en la noche cuidandote. No es seguro que estes sola. Definitivamente estaba llena de mala suerte. Mi situación no podía empeorar más pero tampoco queria arruinar la navidad de nadie. No necesito que nadie cuide de mí. - No será necesario que llames a nadie. - No me siento segura que estes sola. En ocasiones si el clima es malo, suele haber cortes de electricidad y… - No estoy sola. – le interrumpí. – Me encontré con Josh en el aeropuerto. Él se ofreció a traerme pero la vestisca dejó atrapado su auto en el garage. - Bueno por lo menos ninguno de los dos estará solo esta noche. Lo siento tanto, pequeña. - No te preocupes, Peter. Son cosas que pasan. - ¿No estas enojada conmigo? - No es tu culpa. Será meor que vayas con Pool y Loise para que tampoco estes solo. Nadie merece soledad en noche buena. - Eres un angel. Feliz Navidad hermana. - Feliz Navidad, Peter. Dejé el teléfono en su lugar lista para enfretar la situación. Josh se había acomodado en el sofá frente al gran televisor. No se de donde, pero había conseguido un par de mantas. Preparé palomitas de maíz en el microondas y serví el chocolate caliente. Le entregué una taza y coloque las palomitas en la mesita de centro. – Vamos. Sientaté a mi lado. Hace frío. - No gracias. Estoy bien. - Vamos Alex. – seguí en mi lugar. Josh suspiró y su rostro se tornó serio. – Prometiste pensar en nosotros. Solo se que esta es la oportunidad perfecta para descubrir lo que sentimos sin que haya otras personas de por medio. - Que estemos aquí juntos no hace desaparecer el mundo. - Dame esa oportunidad. No pierdes nada. Esto ayudará a que hagas lo correcto. Un día no querrás despertar con la duda de que hubiera sucedido si me dabas una nueva oportunidad…. - Ok. – interrumpí sentandome a su lado. Seguía sin querer escuchar su discurso. Solo viviría el ahroa, luego vera lo que pasa. Josh me estrechó contra él y nos cubrió con las mantas. Vimos un maratón de \"Solo en casa\" aunque lo habíamos visto un centenar de veces. Macaulay Culkin/Kevin era un genio. No podíamos parar de reír. Había oscurecido en algun momento y a pesar de la calefacción, la temperatura había descendido. - Creo que deberíamos cenar. Te parece bien si preparo algo y tú te duchas antes de que se ponga mas frío. – sugiró Josh. - No se si confiarte la cena de noche buena. Quiero algo delicioso. – bromeé. - Déjame sorprenderte. Quiero consentirte. - Vale. Me voy al baño. Me duché lo mas rápido posible. A pesar de que el agua caliente era delicisa el frío seguí filtrandose. Yo le adjudico a los grandes ventanales. Me vestí con unos pantalones cortos y una blusa de manga larga. - Si tienes frío deberías ponerte un pantalón. – dijo señalando mi atuendo. - No juzguez señor calenturiento.- se echó a reír. - Vamos. Ayudame picando las fresas. La crema esta casí lista. Josh había preparado un delicioso arroz navideño con pequeños cuadritos de pimiento rojo y verde. Había descongelado filete y los había preparado con una salsa. De postre había brownies con crema y fresas. Definitivamente agradecía que uno de los dos supiera lucirse en la cocina. La cena estuvo deliciosa. Hablamos de muchas cosas y no paramos de reír. No me había dado cuenta lo inmerso que estaba Josh en mi vida. Mis amigos, mi trabajo, mi fundación. Josh estaba en todo. Limpiamos todo y nos disponíamos a ver otra pelicula cuando todas las luces se apagaron. - Maldición – dijo Josh. – Busca unas velas. - Peter dijo que esto podía pasar. - Deberíamos buscar un lugar donde dormir lo mas caliente posible o donde menos frío haga. La temperatura descenderá mas y nos costara mas entrar en calor mas tarde. Estudié un momento lo que eso significaba. - ¿Estás diciendo que dormiremos juntos? - ¿De nuevo? - Vamos, Alex. No pienses que es intencional pero lo mejor sera que entremos en calor. Si cada uno esta en una habitación nos congelaremos. Entre los dos estaremos mas abrigados. Su lógica era razonable. No dije nada. Lo seguí por toda la casa. – Este será el lugar. En la habitación mas grande había un pasadizo hacia el baño. Lo usaban como ropero. No tenía ventanas y no se filtraba el frió como en las habitaciones. Josh arrastró el colchón de la habitación con dificultad y lo colocó en la mitad. la ropa que estaba en las perchas las colocó alrededor. Trajó las mantas y cobijas de las otras habitaciones. Me mantuvé de pie mirando el lugar donde dormiríamos. Ambos. Solos. Sin que nadie puede interrumpir si algo pasa. Ninguno de los dos está ebrio. Josh regresó con un par de velas que las aseguró sobre el aparador. – Será mejor que nos recostemos. Capítulo 94 No había dormido toda la noche. Mi mente iba y regresaba a un mismo punto. Josh. No podía sacarlo de mí. No podía dejar de pensar en él como algo mas que amigo. No podía quitarme la sensación de sus labios y sus caricias de mi piel. No podía apartarlo. Me levanté al mismo tiempo que mi novio. Él y mis amigos partían hacia nuestra tierra a pasar las fiestas. Yo había prometido quedarme con Peter en la casa de Aspen y mi vuelo salía mas tarde asi que aun tenía tiempo de empacar. Me despedí de los chicos. Realmente los iba a extrañar pero no podía dejar a mi hermano solo. Hice mis maletas y partí hacia el aeropuerto. Creo que me quede dormida un par de veces en la sala de espera. La mala noche me pasaba factura. Apenas mi cabeza tocó el asiento me sumí en un sueño profundo. Cuando despertaba, todo en mí se sentía tan cómodo y relajado como hace mucho no había sucedido. Para ser mas específica, eso solía suceder cuando dormía con Josh. Cuando abrí los ojos me encontré con un rostro conocido que oslo me hizo aferrarme a él por unos segundos mas hasta que el conocimiento llegué a mi y me de cuenta que esto no debería estar pasando. Me aperté rapidamente de sus brazos. Estaba furiosa. Él no debería estar aquí. Abrió sus ojos sorprendido. – ¿Qué mierda haces aquí? — Hola – dijo frotándose los ojos. – Alguien despertó de mal humor. —Estoy a un segundo de golpearte y gritar. – en serio lo haría. —No entiendo porqué. – dijo haciendose el desentendido. —¿No vas a responderme? —Si hablas del hecho que ambos coincidieramos en el mismo vuelo no dejaré que me eches la culpa. Yo solo abordé y te vi. Negocié con tu vecino de asiento para cambiar de lugar. Pensé que te alegraría viajar con un amigo. —Algo me dice que no te crea. – esa sonrisa en su rostro no me daba confianza. —¿En qué soñabas? —No cambies de tema, Josh. Algo aquí huele muy mal. —Te juro que me bañe. Vamos, Alex. Tu mejor que nadie sabe que las casualidades existen. Ademas yo no sabía que vendrías a Aspen. Según yo, tu viajabas con tus ía con mi familia, pero ellos viajaron donde mis abuelos. Aspen es un muy buen lugar para vacacionar. ¿No me dirás que soñabas? Aun no confiaba en él pero tenía un punto. Nadie mas que mis amigos, Peter y mi familia sabian de este viaje. Decidí relajarme por un momento. —No lo recuerdo. —Dijiste mi nombre. – aseguró sonriendo. En algun momento sus manos habían llegado a parar en mi cintura provocando un creciente calor en mi cuerpo. — ¿De verdad? Espera ya recuerdo. Tuve un sueño realmente estupendo. — ¿Ah, sí? – preguntó acercandose a mí. Con su mirada fija en mis labios. Si seguía acercandose de esa manera volveremos a caer en nuestro círculo vicioso. —Sí, ha sido el mejor funeral al que he asistido. Empezó a reir contra mi cuello. Su aliento hacía que me estremezca. Tenía que apartarse pronto. Ya sabía que yo no podái hacerlo. —No creo que soñaras con mi funeral. —Digo en voz baja. —En realidad creo que tenías un sueño erótico conmigo. Ahora yo reía —Estás loco. Lo último que soñaría es a nosotros en esa situación. Y para invalidar mi punto, Josh dio un mordisco en mi cuello haciendome gemir. Es obvio que nosotros en esa situación es exactamente lo que mi cuerpo pide. —Requerimos el uso de sus cinturones de seguridad para el aterrizaje. Gracias por usar nuestros servicios, esperamos que hayan tenido un viaje placentero y que su estadía sea de la misma manera. Felices Fiestas. – dijeron por altavoces. Ambos nos separamos e hicimos lo que nos pidieron. Aterrizamos y desembarcamos. Ambos fuimos por nuestros equipajes. Quise apartarme de Josh todo el tiempo pero él siempre estuvo a mi lado siguiendome. Salí por la puerta principal y trate de detener un taxi sin éxito. El clima era pésimo. Estaba nevando y los únicos taxis que llegaban habían sido pedidos con anticipación. Dedí haber pensando en eso. – Si dejaras de ignorarme nos hubieramos ido hace 20 minutos. Hace frío. - ¿Te das cuenta que no hay un maldito taxi? - Seeeee. Siempre debes llamar para reservar uno. - Supongo que tienes uno. –dije rodando los ojos. - En realidad alquilé un auto que debe estar en el estacionamiento. Me entregaron las llaves en información. Puedo llevarte. - No gracias. Prefiero esperar. - Prefieres morirte de frío que aceptar mi ayuda. Que madura eres. – Su comentario me hizo enojar aún mas. - Vale. Vamos entonces. Su maldita sonrisa de satisfacción apareción en su rostro. Me quitó mi maleta y empezó a camianr hacia el estacionamiento. Lo seguí hasta el auto que había alquilado. Colocó nuestro equipaje en el portamaletas y se acercó a abrir la puerta del copiloto. Dejé escapar un bufido antes de sentarme y colocarme el cinturon de seguridad. Salimos del aeropuerto. El tiempo realmente era malo. Nevaba mucho y había viento. Avanzamos lentamente por la vía. - ¿Tienes la dirección? – le mostré mi celular donde tenía todos los datos de la casa de Peter, bueno tambien era mía. – Bien. Conozco donde es. Asentí. - ¿No vas a hablarme? – ignoré su pregunta. Encendió la radio. Iba cambiando de estación a otra hasta encontrar una con señal clara. Paró en una cuando la canción de coldplay empezaba.

(Por ti me desangraría) It's true, look how they shine for you, (Es verdad, mira como brillan para ti) Look how they shine for you, (Mira como brillan para ti) Look how they shine for...

Josh regresó con un par de velas que las aseguró sobre el aparador. – Será mejor que nos recostemos. Tragué saliva y me acomodé a su lado. Josh envolvió sus brazos a mi alrededor. Mi espalda estaba contra su pecho y el silencio nos envuelve. Finjo dormir pero se que no lo logro, mi respiración me delata. - ¿Por cuánto tiempo vas a fingir que duermes? – su aliento hace cosquillas mi nuca y cuello provocando que mi piel se erice. Estoy lista para responder pero me doy cuenta que si hablo solo confirmaría que estoy despierta y solo trato de evitar tener una conversación con él. Vuelvo a cerralos, porque sé que él querra hablar de nosotros y yo no no puedo decir lo que él quiere oir. Lo que incluso una parte de mí quiere decir. Sus manos en mis caderas me giran hasta quedar frente a frente, pecho a pecho. Sus ojos brillan en la oscuridad y yo siento su aliento en mi cara. Su mano empieza a deslizarse por mi costado. Retengo la respiración porque su aroma esta invadiendo mis sentidos y nublando mi mente. Llevandome a un mundo donde me pierdo entre las sensaciones. Mirándonos fijamente el uno al otro no hablamos, aunque se que él se muere por hacerlo. Pero no es necesario, se lo que me dirá, me imagino cada palabra. Sus ojos viajan a mi boca enviando oleadas de deseo por todo mi ser. - Esto es un sueño – susurró. Tenía razón. Debo estar soñando. Porque en la vida real nadie se olvida del mundo por una caricia. En la vida real nadie puede echar a perder su vida por un chico que una vez ya le engañó. En la vida real no podías estar enamorada de una persona y morirte por entregarte a otra. Su mano subía y bajaba lentamente. Sentía que cada caricia me quemaba a su paso y a la vez me decía que quería más de él, que no estaba siendo suficiente. Entonces mis labios se aventuraron a pasar por sus mejillas, luego bajaron a su mentón y cuello. En cuanto a Josh, decidió que sus manos viajaran a través de mi cuerpo debajo de la ropa, pasándolas con mucho cuidado, incluso puedo decir que su toque era temeroso. Me perdía en el millar de sensaciones que me invadían y sabía que todo lo que habíamos hecho había llegado a su punto de culminación. Este era el siguiente paso. Mañana sería el día de arrepentimientos, pero hoy, hoy solo podía pensar en él. Un pequeño pitido proveniente de su reloj, indicando que era ya la media noche, nos detuvo por un momento. Miré a este chico. A pesar de la oscuridad sabía que me miraba y podía imaginar lo que vería en sus ojos. Deseo… Amor. - Feliz Navidad, Josh – dije antes de que nuestros labios se encontraran. Al principio fue solo un roce y luego fue intensificándose. Mis brazos rodean su cuello y él me va acercando más, tomando mi cintura y luego acariciando mi espalda lentamente. Puedo sentir los latidos del corazón de Josh que parecieran que estuviera emparejándose con el mío y uniéndose en una sola melodía. Nuestros labios se rozaban una y otra vez, encontrando el ritmo perfecto. Nuestras manos exploraban más del otro, dejándose guiar por ese ritmo que habían encontrado nuestros labios. Cada uno se aventuró más que el otro en llegar a lugares que nos hacía perder la cabeza. Nos permitimos disfrutar de dichas caricias y del hecho de que nuestras bocas marcaran el paso de la situación. La ropa se había ido en algún momento. No sé quién le quito a quién cada prenda pero ahora el contacto piel contra piel hacía todo mejor. Josh estaba sobre mí. No dejaba mis labios pero al mismo tiempo sus manos estaban por todas partes. Gemí cuando jugó con mis pezones y mis senos. Gemí cuando nuestras intimidades se rozaron. Gemí cuando juntó nuestros dedos y colocó mis manos sobre mi cabeza aprisionándome con todo su cuerpo. Ambos estábamos realmente excitados. Necesitaba mucho que alivie esa sensación de vacío en mi centro así que envolví mis piernas en su cintura. – Por favor…. – gemí contra sus labios. Me miró por un momento antes de hacer lo que pedí. Sujetó mis caderas con sus manos y de una sola estocada me embistió. La sensación nos llevó casi al límite a ambos. Tuvimos que parar por un momento para controlar nuestras respiraciones. El vaivén de nuestra danza erótica fue aumentando en velocidad. Nuestros gemidos eran ahogados en los labios del otro. Aunque quisimos retenerlo llegamos al límite muy rápido. Si nos comparábamos con hambrientos, diríamos que esto era la comida de las que nos privaron y ahora no podíamos evitar consumirla lo más pronto posible. Mi cuerpo empezó a convulsionar al mismo tiempo que sentí la calidez de Josh derramarse en mi interior. Habíamos alcanzado juntos el orgasmo. Nuestros cuerpos no daban para más. Todas nuestras energías fueron gastadas en esa entrega. El remordimiento empezaba a llegar, pero Josh disipó esos pensamientos cuando me tomó entre sus brazos nuevamente para aferrarme a su cuerpo. Sus labios hacían caminos por todo mi cuello al igual que sus manos por mi cuerpo. No eran caricias que inducían a algo más, eran caricias que no puedes dejar de darle a la persona que quieres porque pareciera que tus manos no pueden despegarse de su piel. -Te amo Alex – dijo Josh entre beso y beso, entre caricia y caricia. De esa manera, entre sus brazos, caí en un sueño profundo. - Esto es un sueño – susurró. Tenía razón. Debo estar soñando. Porque en la vida real nadie se olvida del mundo por una caricia. En la vida real nadie puede echar a perder su vida por un chico que una vez ya le engañó. En la vida real no podías estar enamorada de una persona y morirte por entregarte a otra. Su mano subía y bajaba lentamente. Sentía que cada caricia me quemaba a su paso y a la vez me decía que quería más de él, que no estaba siendo suficiente. Entonces mis labios se aventuraron a pasar por sus mejillas, luego bajaron a su mentón y cuello. En cuanto a Josh, decidió que sus manos viajaran a través de mi cuerpo debajo de la ropa, pasándolas con mucho cuidado, incluso puedo decir que su toque era temeroso. Me perdía en el millar de sensaciones que me invadían y sabía que todo lo que habíamos hecho había llegado a su punto de culminación. Este era el siguiente paso. Mañana sería el día de arrepentimientos, pero hoy, hoy solo podía pensar en él. Un pequeño pitido proveniente de su reloj, indicando que era ya la media noche, nos detuvo por un momento. Miré a este chico. A pesar de la oscuridad sabía que me miraba y podía imaginar lo que vería en sus ojos. Deseo… Amor. - Feliz Navidad, Josh – dije antes de que nuestros labios se encontraran. Al principio fue solo un roce y luego fue intensificándose. Mis brazos rodean su cuello y él me va acercando más, tomando mi cintura y luego acariciando mi espalda lentamente. Puedo sentir los latidos del corazón de Josh que parecieran que estuviera emparejándose con el mío y uniéndose en una sola melodía. Nuestros labios se rozaban una y otra vez, encontrando el ritmo perfecto. Nuestras manos exploraban más del otro, dejándose guiar por ese ritmo que habían encontrado nuestros labios. Cada uno se aventuró más que el otro en llegar a lugares que nos hacía perder la cabeza. Nos permitimos disfrutar de dichas caricias y del hecho de que nuestras bocas marcaran el paso de la situación. La ropa se había ido en algún momento. No sé quién le quito a quién cada prenda pero ahora el contacto piel contra piel hacía todo mejor. Josh estaba sobre mí. No dejaba mis labios pero al mismo tiempo sus manos estaban por todas partes.

No eran caricias que inducían a algo más, eran caricias que no puedes dejar de darle a la persona que quieres porque pareciera que tus manos no pueden despegarse de su piel. -Te amo Alex – dijo Josh entre beso y beso, entre caricia y caricia. De esa manera, entre sus brazos, caí en un sueño profundo. Hooooola..! Q les pareció? definitivamente no soy buena escribiendo lemmons... me toma mucho trabajo y tiempo que decidí dejarlo simple.. han estado esperando esto? EN verdad quiero saber lo que creen q sucederá a partir de este punto. Será un inicio de algo bueno? o solo el final de loq ue aun no empieza? Alex tomará su desición? No me hagan caso...! pero xfa dejen sus reviews... muchas gracias por seguir la historia y por su apoyo cada capítulo..! Sin mas que decir me despido.. nos vemos el próximo domingo :) AVANCE: - ¿Sabes el daño que me estás haciendo? – pregunté irritado. Sabía que había llegado la hora de hacerle enfrentar a la situación porque ella se preocupaba de no herir a todas las personas en el mundo excepto a mí. - ¿Sabes como siento verte deseando que lo de anoche no hubiera ocurrido cuando para mí fue como volver a respirar? Dime que sientes, Alex… dime que significo para ti…[Chapter 95] Capítulo 95 Desperté aunque no quería abrir mis ojos. Para que volver a la realidad si el mundo de los sueños era lo que quería. Me tomó un momento recordar donde estaba y en que situación me encontraba. No pude evitar sonreír recordando la noche anterior. Por primera vez creo que que la suerte me sonríe también. Mi coche atrapado, el corte electrico que nos llevoa dormir juntos. Y vaya que \"dormimos\". Estiré mi brazo para atraerla hacia mí. Me encontré con su sitio frío, señal de que se había ido hace un buen rato. Hubiera deseado ser yo quien la hubiera despertado a besos. Había sido maravilloso volver a tenerla entre mis brazos. Volver a hacer el amor. Volver a sentir esa entrega. Parece tan irreal que aun me cuesta creerlo. Ambos necesitabamos tanto esa cercanía. Todo era tan diferente a tener sexo. En mucho tiempo, es la priemra vez que despierto y estoy feliz de lo que sucedió porque aunque hubo pasión y deseo, tambien hubo lo mas importante… amor. Ese tipo amor que se construye sin contacto físico, sin besos, solo a base de detalles, de pequeñas cosas que te hacen querer a esa otra persona, ese amor genuino, ese tipo de amor que lleva al cielo… el amor que duele mas. Busco mi boxer y me lo pongo. Ya no hace frío, seguramente la electricidad volvió y la calefacción hace su trabajo. El olor a café me envuelve haciendo que mis tripas se revuelvan. Hambre. Alex está de espaldas huntando mantequilla en las tostadas mientras canta. Ella siempre canta, me alegra saber que noha perdido esa costumbre. Lleva puesta su pijama mientras se balancea. Tengo que controlar a mi amigo que despierta ante la escena de su lindo trasero moviendose. Me acerco sin hacer ruido. Decido envolver mis brazos en su cintura. No se aparta pero su cuerpo se tensa. Esto no debe ser bueno. - Feliz Navidad, mi amor. – digo desando su mejilla. No responde a mi saludo. Esto va de mal en peor. Trato de serenarme, quiero entenderla, quiero que me diga porque está tan distante sin presionarla. No quiero arruinar el momento con mi desesperación. - ¿Pasa algo? Trato de que mi voz sea calmada mientras giro su cuerpo para que me enfrente. Sus ojos miran al piso. - ¿Alex? – tiembla ante el sonido de mi voz. Tomó su mentó para mirarla a sus ojos, que empiezan a cristalizarse. - ¿Qué sucede, pequeña? Y llora. La estrechó y ella envuelve sus brazos aferrándose a mí. No quiero verla de esa manera, me rompe el corazón. Se que se siente culpable por lo que sucedió. Yo me siento mal de que ella se sienta de esa manera pero no cambiaría nada de lo que sucedió, soy egoísta pero para mi fue lo mejor. Lo que me duele y temo es que ella se arrepienta. No quiero entender como algo tan maravilloso puede causarle tanto dolor. - Shhh. Tranquila. Todo pasará. – cada lágrima suya me destrozaba. - Soy una mala persona, Josh. Soy ruin, soy mentirosa… soy lo peor. - No digas eso porque no es verdad. – le estreché mas aún. La deje sollozar por otro momento mientras se aferraba a mí. El sonido de la tostadora hizo que se aparte de mí. En silencio terminó de servir el desayuno. Observé todo su trayecto. Ya no lloraba pero su rostro era reflejo de culpa. Desayunamos en silencio y le ayudé a limpiar todo. Quería gritar cada vez que la veía estremecerse cuando había contacto de nuestra piel. Esperé pacientemente a que terminara. Cuando se secaba las manos envolví mis brazos en su cintura, nuevamente. Antes de que apartara la giré hacia mí, sujeté sus caderas sentandola en el mesón y me coloqué entre sus piernas. Mis manos subían y bajaban por la tersa piel de sus muslos. No podía esconder su mirada de esa manera. - No sabes cuánto tiempo he pasado pensando en ti y soñando con esto. Nunca olvidaré esto y estoy seguro de que tú tampoco lo harás. Y no quiero que te arrepientas, quiero que desees que vuelva a suceder. Quiero que olvides todo. Lo prometiste, Alex. Este tiempo era para mí, para nosotros. - No puedo hacer desaparecer el mundo. - ¿Sabes el daño que me estás haciendo? – pregunté irritado. Sabía que había llegado la hora de hacerle enfrentar a la situación porque ella se preocupaba de no herir a todas las personas en el mundo excepto a mí. - ¿Sabes como siento verte deseando que lo de anoche no hubiera ocurrido cuando para mí fue como volver a respirar? Dime que sientes, Alex… dime que significo para ti… - No quiero hablar de esto… ahora. - ¿Entonces cuándo? – practicamente estaba rogándole. Quería huir de la situación podía ver el miedo en su cara. – Si quieres que nos olvidemos del mundo no vamos a hablar de sentimientos ni del pasado. Si quieres que estos días seamos solo nosotros no me acorralarás para que tomé una desición, solo nos dedicaremos a ver que sucede ¿de acuerdo? Estaba escapando otra vez. Sabía como manipularme. Tenía que decidir entre tenerla completamente por unos días o enfrentarme a ella hasta que acepte lo que siente y muy probablmente perderla para siempre. Tomé la desición cuando sus labios tomaron los míos. Decidí aprovechar estos días, luego vería la forma de hacer lo que se necesita. Yo tambien podía jugar esto y mover las cartas a mi favor. – Lo haré si prometes que no te veré arrepentida ni triste en ningun momento. Sus piernas se habían enredado en mi cintura y mis manos ya estaban quitando su ropa. ¿Estaba haciendo bien? ¿Debería dejar que se salga con la suya solo porque le deseo tanto? Alex mordió él lóbulo de mi oreja haciendo que mi cuerpo responda por mí. Ya no hay vuelta atrás. Tomé su trasero y la llevé conmigo a la sala. Quería que fuera especial, querí que recordara lo especial que era cuando estabamos juntos. Así que la deje sobre la alfombra. Besé suavemente su mejilla luego de cernirme sobre ella. Su reacción a mi tacto es evidente, cada toque la hace temblar. Nos besamos lentamente meintras sus manos se aventuran por mi pecho. Mi cuerpo responde con rapidez a su caricia entrando en combustión. No lo puedo evitar, probar su cuerpo me provoca un hambre voraz y repentino que me asediará por siempre. Deseo mas contacto, necesito mas de su piel. Tiro de su playera lentamente, ella me facilita levantando sus brazos. Mi boca va a su clavícula mientras mis manos bajan sus pantalones cortos, ella termina el ttrabajo empujando su prenda con sus pies. Ella me empuja hacia arriba logrando sentarme para poder colocarse a horcajadas. mis dedos quitan su braziers revelandome su torso desnudo. Mis labios trazan un camino entre sus pechos para luego degustar cada uno de ellos. Mi lengua acapara sus pezones exitandonos a ambos. Ella balancea su cadera provocandonos una ola de calor que rrecorre nuestros cuerpos produciendo gemidos que ahogamos en la boca del otro. Paso mus dedos sobre su ropa interior y disfruto de su temblor. La recuesto nuevamente en la alfombra y me adueño de una de sus piernas. Subo por ella dejando un camino de besos hasta llegar a su intimidad depositando unos besos. Sujeto con mis dientes sus bragas y las deslizo hacia abajo. Me desago de mi ropa interior mientras asciendo por su vientre con mis labios. La rodeo con mis brazos atrayendola hacia mí al mismo tiempo que me dejo caer boca arriba llevandola sobre mi cuerpo. Bajo mis manos por su espalda, su cintura hasta sus gluteos, que aprieto para hacerle gemir. Los sonidos de su boca me llevan al extremo. Una de mis manos abandona su gluteo para adentrarse en la cara interna de sus muslos y estimula el lugar que muero por entrar. Suspira, resopla y gime. Toma mi mano alejandola de ese lugar, luego se posiciona sobre mí acomodando su entrada sobre mi palpitante ser. Mi mano va a su rostro, ella deja caer su mejilla sobre ella. Ella empuja mi mienbro muy dentro mientras nuestros ojos se encuentran. Nos desvancecemos en cada embestida. Nunca he visto espectáculo mas maravilloso que verle ahora cabalgarme. Cada movimiento nos lleva al límite, cada gemido nos pide más. Si tan solo me hubiera dicho que me ama. Despues de tanto tiempo quiero poder creer al menos eso. Tiró de su espalda para que mi boca viole a la suya. – Josh… El sonido de su voz me llevó al extasis derramando mi calidez dentro de ella lo que la hace llegar a su orgasmo. Muerdo sus labios mientras la siento convulsionar sobre mí. Aun quiero mas de ella. Quiero aprovechar cada minuto de esto y pienso cumplir cada una de las fantasías que he tenido con ella. Dejo que su cuerpo repose boca abajo en la alfombra mientras su respiración se normaliza. Me coloco a un lado para poder besar su espalda. Hago un camino húmedo desde su cuello hasta sus glúteos donde me deleito mordiéndolos. Coloco mi cuerpo sobre el de ella separando sus piernas. Entrelazo nuestros dedos fijandolos en el suelo a cada lado de su cabeza antes de entrar en ella de una sola estocada. Esta posición me hace llegar más profundo y en cuestion de pocas embestidas ambos llegamos juntos al éxtasis, nuevamente. Sin salir de ella dejo que mis labios paseen de nuevo por sus hombros y cuello. Cada uno de sus gemidos quedará grabado en mi mente asi como el sabor de su piel. Con ella todo es más intenso. Es fácil sacarse la ropa y tener sexo; he hecho eso muchas veces. Pero abrir tu alma y dejar que alguien descubra tus miedos, tu futuro, tus sueños cuando tu espiritu esta conectado con otra persona… eso es verdaderamente hacer el amor. Tomo la manta que estaba sobre el sofá y nos cubro. Luego de esto nos merecemos un buen descanso. Y es así como nos sumimos en el sueño. Alex cumplió su promesa. No volví a verle triste o estresada mas. Disfrutabamos cada momento juntos, hablamos de muchas cosas, hicimos largas caminatas por el bosque de la propiedad, cocinamos juntos y hacíamos el amor cada instante. Nos olvidamos del mundo. La realidad estaba muy lejos de nuestro perfecto mundo. Esta era la vida que realmente he querido, mi vida a su lado. Ella era mi vida. Aunque teníamos muchos lugares a los cuales ir, decidimos quedarnos en la casa para no correr el riesgo de que alguien me reconociera. Sabía porque ella lo hacía aunque yo me moría por gritarle al mundo que ella era mía. Devoré sus labios cuando el nuevo año llegó para luego meterla entre las sábanas nuevamente. Hemos sido creativos, nuevas formas de hacer el amor, nuevas posiciones y nuevos lugares. Mañana tendríamos que volver a nuestra realidad y no dejaba de cuestionarme como iba a ser. A quien elegiría, en que momento diría que me amaría o que no. Me prometí a mi mismo que ella me daría su respuesta antes de volver, mientras me sumergía en su cuerpo nuestra última noche. Le dije que la amo mientras me sumía en el sueño aferrado a su cuerpo. Soñé con la vida que quería a su lado. Cada detalle, desde nuestra rutina diaria, hasta la escuela de nuestros hijos. Desperté sin ella a mi lado. Fui en su busca y no encontré nada. Busque por la casa y por los alrededores. Regresé a nuestra habitación y encontré que su maleta no estaba. Se había ido. Ella había huido. Pero esta vez no dejaré que se escape. Hooooola? Alex está un poco manipuladora, no creen? No me maten estoy en exámenes, recien termino el día martes espero q me tengan paciencia. pronto estaré de vacaciones y espero poder terminar de escribir la novela :) Realmente sin mas q decir tengo q seguir estudiando.. espero sus reviews, gracias a los q los dejan.. x cierto tendrán muchos lemmons en los siguientes capítulos :) Nos leemos luego :) ...-.-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: No entendía como una persona era capaz de quitarme la voluntad. No sabía como resistirme a sus caricias. No podía quedarme sin esto. - ¿Él te hace sentir de esta manera? - su mano viajaba por la car interna de mi muslo a ese punto que tanto reclamaba atención. - ¿Él puede hacerte perder la cabeza con su toque? - Josh…- suspiraba contra su cuello. Él sabía como torturarme, sabía lo vulnerable que estaba en estos momentos y los usaba para interrogarme. - Dímelo, Alexandra.[Chapter 96] Me había preparado para este momento durante todo el día y aún no tenía idea de como iba a lidiar. Tampoco encontraba explicación para el tipo de persona que me he convertido. Evadía mis problemas, engañaba a las personas que amaba, jugaba con los sentimientos de otras. Pero no podía detenerme. Sabía que todo estaba mal pero no quería perder lo que tenía. Darío era mi sitio seguro. Podía confiar plenamente en que él no me engañaría, él siempre estaría a mi lado con sus brazos abiertos porque me ama. Josh… Josh era fuego. Josh era descontrol. Josh era pasión y desenfreno. Podía borrar el mundo a mi alrededor con su toque. Podía hacer que lo desee tan desesperadamente que la necesidad por él es igual que mi necesidad por aire. No me había costado esfuerzo olvidarme del mundo mientras estuve con él. Sentí culpa, es verdad, pero cuando me concentré en él, todo desapareció. Solo eramos Josh y yo en nuestra burbuja y era como retroceder en el tiempo a cuando nos pertenecíamos uno al otro. Ya no era así. Hemos recorrido un largo camino desde ahí que solo logra separarnos. No entiendo como él no puede ver eso. En medio de todo he descubierto que me amó, me ha hecho dudar sobre su traición, pero también he olvidado todo eso, y aunque él pueda creer que no estoy con él porque aun me duele lo sucedido con Shannon, no es verdad. Eso no se me ha pasado por la cabeza. Pero no puedo estar con él porque nuestros destinos fueron por diferente camino y aunque él trate de volver a juntarlos no podrá ser. No puedo lanzarme a sus brazos solo porque él lo quiere. Ni siquiera estoy segura de mis sentimientos hacia él como para arriesgarme a perder todo lo bueno que tengo por algo que quizás no sea mas que desenfreno, hormonas o deseo. Él quiere que lo elia pero no lo voy hacer. Josh no es mi elección, mi novio sí. Pero una parte de mi corazón no quiere alejarlo. No soportaría su lejanía. Ahora tengo que encontrar la forma de alejarme de él sin que mi corazón lo extrañe porque me conozco y nunca podré ser feliz si no lo hago de esa manera. Pero para ello no puedo decirle mi deisicón aún, pero tampoco puedo comportarme como una zorra y caer en su cama por su toque. No puedo seguir engañando a Darío. Ya de por sí no tengo idea de como mirarlo a los ojos. Josh ha estado en silencio desde que llegó. Había venido a nuestra oficina para enviar unos correos. Mary, la secretaria de Peter, me pidió que revise unos balances, ella tenía preparado toda una presnetación. Sabía que tomaría tiempo pero me insistió que si terminabamos hoy podría deshacerse de tarea por el resto de la semana. Me acomodé en la silla del escritorio mientras ella me explicaba todo. Josh llegó en mi busca. Usé a Mary como excusa, pero mientras mas tiempo concurría mas pronto llegaría el momento que había evitado ayer cuando me fui mientras él aún dormía. - Como pudieron ver todo está dentro de lo establecido, pero si desean implementar mas publicidad tendrán que renegociar con la empresa. - Nuestro actual contrato dura hasta abril. ¿verdad? – preguntó Josh. por lo menos uno de nosotros prestó atención a lo q Mary decía. Yo solo me perdí en mis pensamientos. - Correcto. Sería mas factible si realizan un contrato nuevo luego que termine este antes de pasar por toda la renegociación. - Para abril ya habremos terminado todo el papeleo para la contrucción del hospital en Kentucky, podríamos enfocar la publicidad en la contrucción de este. - Es una buena idea – concluyó Mary mirandome en espera de aprobación. - Si. Es una buena idea. - Gracias por quedarse escuchándome. En verdad, mañana tengo mucho trabajo. - No te preocupes Mary. – dije con una sonrisa. - No hay problema. Nos quedaremos un rato más firmando y haciendo lo que nos corresponde para que mañana puedas enviar a quienes debes y estes mas tranquila. – hice una mueca cuando entedí las intenciones de Josh. - ¿Necesitan algo antes de que me vaya? – preguntó Mary mientras recogía sus cosas. - No, gracias. ¿Podrías avisarle al guardia nocturno que nos quedaremos en la oficina? - Claro. Hasta mañana. - Hasta mañana – dijimos a la vez. Me senté frente al computador tratando de concentrarme en los valores que tenía que estudiar antes de firmar. Sabía que Mary había hecho un buen trabajo pero nuestra responsabilidad es siempre estudiar todos los movimientos antes de aprobar algo. - Sabes que todo está bien. Solo debemos firmar. - Quiero revisar todo. - Lo que quieres es evadirme. – dijo enojado. Odiaba cuando Josh se cabreaba porque sus palabras solían hacerme daño. Se quedó en silencio un momento. - ¿Porqué te fuiste? Tomé aire y respondí suavemente. – Tenía que hacerlo. Tenía que volver al mundo real y si hubieras estado conmigo lo habría complicado todo. - Eso no es excusa. – se pusó de pie y empezó a caminar por la oficina. Sus manos se aferraban a sus cabezas. – Estoy harto de este juego. Necesito respuestas ahora, Alexandra. Quiero saber que va a pasar con nosotros. No sabía que responder porque no podía dejarlo ir aún. Por suerte mi celular sonó en mi bolso dandome unos segundos mas de ventaja. Josh lo alcanzó antes y pulsó el boton de contestar poniéndolo en altavoz. - ¿Alex? – La voz de mi novio resonó por toda la oficina. Josh se tensó, sus manos volviéndose puños. - Darío… - Hola, cariño. ¿Dónde te has metido? Te he llamado todos los días desde que me fui y mira la hora que te encuentro. Estuve a punto de volver, pero Peter me explicó de la tormenta en Aspen. Te he extrañado tanto, mi vida. - Yo también – dije suavemente sin quitar mi vista de Josh. - Bueno, no tendrás que extrañarme más. Estoy en el aeropuerto esperando mi vuelo. Mañana estaremos juntos y sabes que no pienso separarme más de ti. - Pensé que regresabas la otra semana. - Cambie mi vuelo, no podía estar mas sin ti. Solo yo regreso ahora. Pensaba en que podemos tener tiempo solo para nosotros. Aún quiero estrenar ese sofá. El puño de Josh provocó un estruendo en la pared. No podía controlar lo que Darío decía, él debería entender eso. - Me llamas para ir por ti al aeropuerto. Tengo que irme, pequeño. - Te amo, Alex. Corté la llamada sin responder. La frente de Josh estaba apoyado en la pared. Me acerqué lentamente aun sin saber que decir. Me tomó por sorpresa cuando me atrajo a su cuerpo y me besó desesperadamente. Me tomó un segundo responder, sabía que no debía pero simplemente no podía controlarme. Sus manos estaban por todo lado. Su boca devoraba la mía pidiendo rendición. Los botones de mi blusa salieron disparados por todo lado cuando él se dispuso a quitármela. Tomó mis muslos para enredarlos en su cintura, dejando que mi espalda chocara con la pared. No entendía como una persona era capaz de quitarme la voluntad. No sabía como resistirme a sus caricias. No podía quedarme sin esto. - ¿Él te hace sentir de esta manera? - su mano viajaba por la car interna de mi muslo a ese punto que tanto reclamaba atención. - ¿Él puede hacerte perder la cabeza con su toque? - Josh…- suspiraba contra su cuello. Él sabía como torturarme, sabía lo vulnerable que estaba en estos momentos y los usaba para interrogarme. - Dímelo, Alexandra. – había logrado deshacerse de nuestra ropa. Su toque me tenía gimiendo desperada por más. Él rozaba su miembro con mi feminidad llevándome en el camino del éxtasis sin dejarme tocar la meta. Mi cuerpo dolía literalmente. – Nadie puede darte lo que yo. nadie puede hacerte sentir de esta manera. Tenía razón. Con él todo era diferente. Josh siempre fue un punto debil. – Para Josh… El roce de nuestras intimidades estaba matándome - ¿Por qué? - No esta bien – no podía formular pensamientos coherente. - Dime que necesitas, dime que solo yo te hago sentir de esta manera y le daré a tu cuerpo lo que necesita. – por mas que quiera resistir no puedo. - Sí – gemí. - ¿Sí qué? – quería matarlo y torturarlo como él lo estaba haciendo. - Te necesito. – sus tortura continuaba – Solo tú me haces sentir de esta manera… por favor. Giró mi cuerpo y me apretó contra la pared. De una sola estocada entró en mí aliviando el dolor que me infringía. El vaivén de sus caderas me llavaba al límite. No tenía necesidad de pedir que cambaira el ritmo porque él me conocía de tal manera que sabía cuando necesitaba que aumentara la velocidad. El orgasmo me atravesó devastandome por completo. Josh sostuvo mi cuerpo tembloroso entre sus brazos y me recostó en el sofá acomodandome sobre su cuerpo. No pensaba con claridad pero de cierta manera sabía que no podía perder esto. Lo necesitaba, no podía dejar de tenerlo de esta manera pero también lo odiaba por torturarme y hacerme necesitarlo. Sus labios rozaban mi frente. – Solo contigo estoy completo. - Te odio. No puedes jugar conmigo de esta manera solo para que te diga lo que quieres escuchar. Su mano subía y baja por mi espalda desnuda. – Es lo mismo que tú hiciste comigo en Aspen. No me odias. Te odias a ti mismo por no tener el control. Sabes que me deseas y no puedes vivir estar sin mí. Tienes razón, escucharte admirtir que soy él unico que puede desarmarte de esa manera es lo que quería oír pero es algo que ya sabía. La diferencia con tu novio u otras personas es que nosotros hacemos el amor por eso todo es tan diferente, fuerte… perfecto. - Es sexo. Te deseo, me atraes, eso es todo. - Basta.- su tono era serio y seco. – Deja de escapar. Se sincera contigo misma. No respondí a sus acusaciones. Hoy estaba tan decidida a terminar con esto y ahora simplemente no puedo y de alguna manera debo recuperar el control. - ¿Me amas? – susurró. El tono esperanzado de su voz se coló en mi corazón y mi alma queriendo que responda. Pero llené el espacio con mas silencio mientras meditaba mi siguiente movimiento. - ¿Quieres esto, Joshua? Es lo único que puedo darte. No voy a dejar a Darío por ti y la única forma en que me puedes tener es de esta manera, pero si vamos a hacer esto se acabaron las preguntas absurdas sobre mis sentimientos. No más celos y reclamos. No mas palabras de amor. Solo tu y yo teniendo sexo. Una declaración de amor y se terminó. Si quieres un poco de mí tendras que aceptar lo que te doy. Me miró por un momento, su rostro serio tratando de analizarme. Tal vez esperaba encontrar que mis palabras era una broma, ni yo misma sabía lo que hacía. No encontraba otra manera de que esta situación mejorara. – No puedes hacerme esto, Alexandra. ¿quieres que sea el otro?¿ Quieres que me contente con solo sexo? Alex yo quiero todo de ti. No quiero sus migajas, quiero cada momento, cada pensamiento, cada sentimiento que tengas. Quiero que respires y vivas por lo que tenemos. ¿cómo puedes pedir que me conforme con menos de eso? Me estás matando, ni siquiera se como soporto verte con él y me pides que no diga nada cuando vea que te toca sabiendo que yo también tengo. No puedo compartirte… - Eso es lo que quiero. Acabas de mostrar un punto, te deseo y no puedo resistirme a esto – dije señalando ambos – pero no voy a perder lo que tengo por una simple aventura. Es tú decisión, Josh. Me quieres de alguna manera, pues es lo único que puedo ofrecerte. La persona que hablaba definitivamente no era yo, era una persona cruel y manipuladora, y una persona que no metía las consecuencias y el daño que cada acción provocaba, pero no encontraba otro manera. Josh se puso de pie y empezó a vestirse. Podía ver su conflicto interno. Traté de vestirme con la poca ropa que aquí no había sido desgarrada. Antes de salir por la puerta se detuvo para encontrar mi mirada – Lo pensaré. En cuanto se fue, las lágrimas desbordaban mis mejillas. No podía evitar que me doliera tanto como a él, no podía evitar que parte de mi corazón le pertenezca y se rompa por su dolor. Al final ya había puesto las cartas sobre la mesa, ya sólo quedaba ver qué era lo que sucedía. Sabía que habría consecuencias y daños pero mi muy cobarde yo sé arriesgaba. Cuando llegué a mi departamento horas despues, encontré maletas en la entrada. Darío había llegado. Entré a nuestra habitación y escuché el agua en la ducha. Me pusé ropa más cómoda y me acomodé en mi escritorio a estudiar. - Hola – dijo mi novio saliendo de la ducha solo envuelto en una toalla. - Hola – dije fingiendo una sonrisa. - ¿Qué sucede? – dijo preocupado. Se pusó sus pantaloncillos rapidamente antes de acercarse a mí. - Nada. Lo siento. Deberías tener un mejor recibimiento pero… estoy cansada. – me dirigió una sonrisa antes de atraerme a sus brazos. - Te extrañe tanto, amor. - Yo tambien te extrañé – sus labios acariciaban mi cuello y sus manos se filtraban bajo mi camiseta. – Estoy cansada. No quería acostarme con él, pero tampoco quería que pensara que algo iba mal – Esta bien. Habrá tiempo para esto luego. Vamos a dormir. Nos acomodamos en la cama. Sus abrazos encerrándome. Me había puesto una playera de mangas largas porque de alguna manera el contacto de su piel me hacía sentir peor. Culpable. Además mi mente solo quería regresar a esa cabaña en Aspen donde mi mundo parecía perfecto. HOOOOOLA :) Me extrañaban? :) ¿Que les pareció? ahora si tienen una clara pista de la corta etapa q vendrá... xfa dejen sus premoniciones.. estoy ansiosa x leer sus comentarios.. denme algo con q alegrarme..! sin mas q decir me retiro a estudiar :D Noss leemos pronto :) .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET AVANCE: – No te sorprendas tanto, no es algo que no conozcas. - Te gusta ponermelo dificil ¿verdad? – dije mientras le veía meterse bajo el agua desnuda. - Tú insististe en el baño. - SI pero nunca pedí que te desnudarás en mi delante. - No seas hipócrita. Te gustó el espectáculo.[Chapter 97] Corrí tras ella bajo la lluvia. Fui a verla en su trabajo y a lo lejos divise como corría por la calle, seguramente para tomar un taxi. Me apresuré a alcanzarla. Me sorprendió ver que en lugar de tratar de para un auto cruzo la avenida y siguió caminando en dirección de su departamento. Siempre testaruda, nunca pensaba en que podía enfermarse. Aligeré mi paso para detenerla. Necesitaba habalr con ella y lo mejor sería que lo hicieramos en mi departamento a un par de calles en la otra dirección. La llamé por su nombre pero ella no dejaba de caminar por lo que tuve que sujetar sus hombros para detenerla. – Mierda Joshua, casi me sacas el corazón del susto. Su expresión por un momento me hizo reír. Llevaba sus audífonos, ahora entendía porque no me habia escuchado. Tiré uno de ellos antes de responder. - No escuchabas cuadno te llamaba. Además, no entiendo como puedes andar por la calle bajo la lluvia. Enfermarás. - No es de tu incumbencia. La lluvia me relaja… me ayuda a pensar. - Y vaya que tienes mucho que pensar… - Sí, aunque no lo creas no tomo desiciones importantes a la ligera. – me dijo retándome. - ¿Así que pensaste durante mucho tiempo en la manera de convertirme en tu amante? Vaya, eso es una novedad Alexandra, pensé que eso había sido resultado de la emoción del momento. Mi mejilla ardía luego de su golpe. Su expresión llena de ira me dijo que había ido demasiado lejos. Lo había hecho pero ver la poca importancia que ella le daba a mis sentimientos me hacía hervir por dentro. - Vete al diablo, Joshua. Tú eres quién me busca, tú… tú me atormentas para que cambie decisiones que ya estan tomadas, tú me orillaste a esto y me lo echas en cara. Eres un maldito estúpido, engreído. No entiendo como pude dejarte entrar en mi vida de nuevo. Soy una tonta por pensar que podías envajar en mi vida sin hacerme daño. Es lo único que has hecho desde que te conocí. Sus palabras fueron como bofeteada. Parte de mí se alegraba en verla frustrada. Ojalá de esa manera entendiera como me siento con sus desiciones, pero saber que solo tiene presente los malos momentos, que me diga que solo le causo dolor me hace sentir despreciable. - No quería decir eso – traté de explicarme – Vale. Si quería decir cosas que te hagan daño, pero entiende que para mí no es sencillo aceptar que la única manera en que puedo tenerte es si te comparto con otra persona. Me duele hacerme a la idea de verte con alguien mas quien puede reclamarte como su propiedad, gritarle al mundo que te tiene y yo solo conformarme con mijagas.. con escasos momentos que quiera ofrecerme. - No tienes porque hacerlo si no quieres. – susurró tristemente. Me percaté del espectaculo que estabamos dando. Varias personas se había detenido a ver nuestra discusión a pesar de la lluvia. – Vamos a mi departamento y hablemos. Por suerte no se resistió y caminamos bajo la lluvia, que había aumentado, hacia mi departamento. Ninguno dijo nada en todo el trayecto hasta que cerré la puerta. - Debería quitarme esta ropa para no mojar tu piso. ¿Puedes prestarme algo? - Claro, pero lo mejor será que tomes una ducha. Estás temblando. – lo hacía, el frío se filtraba por nuestra piel, sus labios estaban morados y sus dientes castañeaban. - Si no te importa, prefiero irme cuanto antes, asi que dime lo que tengas que decir. – me quedé en silencio intentado descifrar la rudeza de sus palabras. Ella puso sus ojos en blanco y se dirigió a mi baño. Caminé detrás de ella para saber que se proponía. Ya en mi baño abrió la ducha y pronto el vapor del agua caliente empezó a filtrarse mientras ella se quitaba su ropa mojada. Me quedé mirandola fijamente mientras peleaba con su pantalón que se había adherido como una segunda piel. – No te sorprendas tanto, no es algo que no conozcas. - Te gusta ponermelo dificil ¿verdad? – dije mientras le veía meterse bajo el agua desnuda. - Tú insististe en el baño. - SI pero nunca pedí que te desnudarás en mi delante. - No seas hipócrita. Te gustó el espectáculo. – de alguna manera una gran carcajada hacía camino a mi garganta. - Vale. Lo admito. Verte desnuda siempre será un placer y mas aún si soy yo quien realiza el proceso pero el hecho de que sugiriera una ducha era porque me preocupa tu salud, no espera semejante premio. - Como digas. Será mejor que me digas tu respuesta, Josh. Quiero irme lo más pronto posible. No era díficil decidir. Ya había preparado mi respuesta cuando fui en su busca. Practicamente se lo había dicho antes. Había dicho lo mucho que me dolía aceptar ese tipo de cosas cuando yo quería mas, pero el problema es que cuando amas te aferras tanto a esas pequeñas posibilidades, a esas migajas porque es lo único que te puede hacer feliz. Me desvestí rapidamente y me metí con ella a la ducha sorprendiendola con un beso que obviamente no rechazó. - ¿Es eso un sí? – Asentí – Sabes las reglas, Josh. No mas declaraciones de amor, ni celos ni exigencias. Esto será sexo, solo eso. Repítelo. Dolía escuchar sus palabras y dolía decirlo. Tambien estba convencido de ganar tiempo y de alguna manera buscar la forma de que ella se quede conmigo. Traté de sonar convincente. – Solo sexo. - Bien – dijo antes de que sus labios devoraran los míos. No esperé ni un segundo antes de responderle con la misma intensidad. La hice mía en la ducha, disfrutando de la calidez de nuestros cuerpo y del agua. Tendría muchas cosas que afrontar de ahora en adelante. No sabía como prepararme para verla con él sin saltar sobre ella y gritar que era mía. No entendía la forma en que ella podía desligar los sentimientos de cada acto. No comprendía como yo podía olvidar el mundo solo por mas instantes como este. Hicimos el amor por todo mi departamento. Todo se había convertido en arranques pasionales, en nuevas maneras de disfrutar, y para mí era entregarme a la chica que robó mi corazón con solo una mirada. Debo aceptar que mucho fue mi culpa. Primero trate de meterla en mi cama sin preocuparme en sus sentimientos, luego la engañé. No quisé hacerlo, Dios sabe lo que haría por retroceder el tiempo y no haber caído en la trampa de Shannon, pero yo le di a Alex razones para desconfiar por lo que no puedo culparla completamente. Utilicé nuestra relación para elevar mi fama, además que le oculté lo de Shannon, pero nadie podía entender el miedo que tenía de perderla. Ahora estamos de esta manera. Encontrandonos furtivamente, desatando nuestros deseos en los lugares menos esperados, en mi departament, en nuestra oficina, en nuestro auto, incluso en el cuarto de residencia de su trabajo. No voy a negar lo emocionante que ha sido cada uno de los encuentros, me siento como un adolescente con su primera novia lleno de hormonas alborotadas, pero toda esa felicidad se esfuma cuando tiene que irse o cuando su novio la busca. Muchas veces he tenido que retener mi ira cuando él llamaba o ella tenía que dejarme por volver a su lado. Por suerte no he tenido que verlos juntos, no quiero ni imaginar como haré cuando eso suceda. Ahora mi mano se filtraba bajo su uniforme. Teníamos que reunirnos para firmar unos papeles de compra de unos lotes por lo que nos reunimos en nuestra oficina con los abogados, Collins, Peter y el notario. Ni bien se depidieron, le acorralé contra la puerta en un necesitado beso. Sus dedos se enredaban en mi cabello mientras mis labios se apoderaban de su cuello, con cuidado de no dejar marcas. Tiré de la blusa de su uniforme sacandola por la cabeza para revelar su piel morena adornada con un sexy brazier. Hice un camino de besos por su cuello bajando hasta el valle de sus senos. Me detuvé bruscamente cuando en su brazo encontré un gran hematona con forma de dedos. Gruñí por dentro de solo pensar en quién pudo sujetarla con tal rudeza. - ¿Qué pasa? - ¿Quién te hizo esto? – gruñí. Ella miro su brazo y me miró incrédula. – Alexandra, si ese estúpido te agredió te juro que lo voy a matar. - No seas dramático. Este moretón me lo hiciste tú, en uno de nuestros arranques. No creía que yo hubiera llegado a ser tan brusco como para maltratarla de esta manera. Puse mis dedos encajándolos con los del moretón y efectivamente eran de mi tamaño. – Lo siento. - No te preocupes – dijo enredando sus brazos en mi cuello para besarme – No es tu culpa, no fuiste brusco. Es solo que tengo cierta fragilidad vascular y un toque medio fuerte me produce hematomas. En pocas palabras mi piel es delicada. No me sentía feliz con su explicación. – Mira. – dijo apartándome y tirando del elástico de su pantanlon para revelarme sus muslo. Evidentemente habían varios moretones en ellos, muchos de ellos alargados como dedos. - ¿Estás segura de que eso es normal? – pregunté preocupado. - No es algo de lo que debas preocuparte. Aunque debo admitir que ha sido una hazaña cubrirlos. Ahora ven aquí y bésame. – Acepté su invitación aun con preocupación. Temía hacerle daño con mi toque. – Josh, deja de tocarme como si fuera de cristal. Traté de disipar mi mente, ella consiguió hacerlo cuando sus manos viajaron por mi pantalón. Era facil olvidar el mundo cuando solo eramos nosotros. Me costaba no gritar que la amo cada vez que le hacía mía, pero no quería arriesgarme a su enojo y perderla. Su celular emitió un pitido y ella se apartó de mí para leerlo. – Me tengo que ir. Es tarde. No quería preguntarle porque la premura si hace unos segundos ella era la interesada en arrancarme la ropa. No podía parecer celoso. – No puedes dejar así de animado al pequeño Joshi. Ella se echó a reír mientras acomodaba su ropa. – Puedes arreglarle una cita con Manuela. Tengo un asunto urgente que resolver. No quería masturbarme, quería que ella se ocupe de mí. - Alex- llamé antes de que llegue a la puerta. - ¿Qué pasa? - No seas maleducada y despídete como se debe. – ella solo puso los ojos en blanco y se acercó para besarme. No dudé en aprisionarla con mis brazos y mis labios. - Deja de torturarme. No puedo quedarme, Joshua. Me dio un último beso antes de salir por la puerta y como siempre empecé a extrañarla. Me gustaba dormir con ella, es fabuloso abrir los ojos y que su rostro sea lo primero que veo. Pero no eran todas las noches, me imaginaba que su excusa para salirse de su departamento era algun turno porque siempre llegaba con su uniforme de residente. También sabía que cuando Darío no estaba, ella llamaba a mi puerta y pasábamos todo el fin de semana encerrados en mi departamento. Se había convertido en una rutina luego de más 2 meses de tener esta \"relación\". - Hola, Claudia.- contesté mi celular mientras abrí la puerta de mi departamento. - Josh ¿Cómo estás? – su tono era un poco cauto. - Todo bien. Y ¿Cómo estas tú?. - Bien. Gracias por preguntar. Estoy en Boston y quería ver si quieres venir conmigo al cine. Pensaba en rechazarla pero me di cuenta que no tenía planes para hoy y no quería pasarmelo solo pensando en Alex. – Vale. ¿A qué hora es la función? - A las 7. Podemos encontrarnos en el cine o en tu departamento. - Mejor paso por ti en una hora. - Vale. Te espero. – su voz emocionada me hizo sentir culpable. No quería darle ningun tipo de señal que pueda malinterpretar mis intenciones con ella. Me dí una ducha rápida, no estaba sucio, cimplemente me sentía rodeado del perfume de Alex, y creo que por hoy no debería pensar ella. Seguramente ella ni siquiera me recuerda. Claudia se subió a mi moto de un salto y se aferró a mi muy animada. Discutíamos sobre que película ver. Yo quería ver Rápidos y Furiosos 9 mientras ella quería ver una de drama. Finalmente acepté ver su película ya que ella fue da la idea. Por dos horas me senté a su lado tratando de concentrarme en la trama y evitando que Claudia haga algún movimiento conmigo como tomarme de la mano, poner su cabeza en mi hombro o besarme. - ¿Qué te pareció? – dijo mientras salíamos de nuestra sala. Estaba aferrada a mi brazo. - Interesante. – traté de ser amable. - Josh. – una voz me llamaba, giramos para encontrarnos con que era Darío quien decía mi nombre acompañado de su novia. - Qué coincidencia encontrarlos aquí. – dijo mas alegre de lo normal. Por alguna razón entrelacé mis manos con las de Claudia lo que no pasó por desapercibido para Alex que miraba fijamente esta unión. - Hola, Josh. es bueno verte. – Alexandra frunció el ceño mientras observaba a Claudia. Darió abrazó su cintura atrayendola hacia él. - Como veo que estos no nos presentarán, soy Darío. – Dijo ofreciendole una mano a Claudia. - Soy Claudia. – respondió muy sonriente. - Un gusto. ¿Están llegando o ya se van? – preguntó Darío. - Estamos saliendo. Pensaba en que podíamos ir a comer algo. – dije mirando a Claudia. En verdad no había planeado nada pero quería ver si podía provocar a Alex. - ¿Y ustedes? - Igualmente. – dijo una seria Alexandra. - Alex quería ver Rápidos y Furiosos y no pude hacer mas que consentirla. Ya sabes como es cuando quiere algo. –Darío besó la mejilla de su novia y ella enredo su brazo a su cintura. Tuve que retener la rabia. - Admite que estuvo fantástica – dijo ella mirandolo a los ojos con dulzura. - Fue buena. Solo te aviso que no vendré a verla de nuevo, conociéndote la veras diez mil veces antes de cambiar a otra. - Ese es el plan. – me sentía como intruso mientras los miraba conversar en su búrbuja. - ¿Tienen algo que hacer? Si lo desean pueden acompañarnos a comer. Mi novia quiere ir a McDonalds. Lo que quería era largarme de este lugar y llevarmela conmigo a algun sitio en que la pueda hacer mía. Pero no era posible así que lo único que podía hacer era buscar la manera de ver si puedo provocar alguna reacción en ella. - Yo me apunto. ¿Qué dices Claudia? Aunque pensé que no le gustaría la idea se le notaba entusiasmada. – Me fascina la idea. Caminamos por la calle hacia el local de McDonalds. Alex iba abrazada a Darío y yo llevaba a Claudia de la mano. - ¿Qué tiene esa chica que todos babean por ella? Me sorprendió su pregunta. Su voz sonaba llena de resentimeinto. – Difícil de explicar. - Es que simplemente no entiendo. Ni siquiera es tan bonita como para presumir de ello, tampoco tiene un cuerpo espectacular como otras chicas con las que has salido. A mi parecer es una perra presumida que no se conforma con tener la atención de un solo chico. - No la insultes. - Solo estoy diciendo lo que pienso. No entiendo que le ven. - Puede que no sea la mas bonita o tengo el mejor cuerpo para otros, pero para mí ella es MI BONITA. Su forma de ser, su entrega, su pasión, su corazón, su alma. Es de esas personas que tienen los pies sobre la tierra y tratan de dar lo mejor de ellos. Es humana y se equivoca pero siempre trata de se una mejor persona. Es difícil explicar que es lo que exactamente te enamora de una persona, yo diría que es todo en sí, sus virtudes y defectos, todo te enamora. - Llegamos – dijo entusiasmada mi niña interrumpiendo mi discurso a Claudia. Buscamos una mesa y nos ubicamos cada pareja. Me senté frente a Alex. Cada uno hizo su pedido. - ¿Qué tiempo llevan juntos? – preguntó Claudia. - Tres años y medio. – Contestó Darió besando el dorso de la mano de Alex. Tuve que retener las ganas de vomitar. – Estamos festejando nuestro aniversario. - Vaya. Eso es mucho tiempo. – Solo pensar todo el tiempo que he perdido sin ella. - Si me perdonan voy al baño antes de que nos traigan la comida. – dijo Alex poniendose de pie. - ¿No han pensado en casarse? – la pregunta de Claudia me tomó desprevenido. - ¿Puedo contarte un secreto? Ya compré el anillo hace rato ¿verdad Josh? – preguntó el estúpido muy orgulloso. – Pero no he encontrado aún la ocasión de darselo. Pense en San Valentí pero estuve fuera de Boston. Ahora tenía planeado darle en su cumpleaños en 3 semanas pero Alex viajará con Josh y Collins. Lamentablemente no puedo ir debido a mi carrera. Sonreí para mis adentro recordando el festejo que tuvimos en San Valentín con Alex. Fue hermosos hacer el amor rodeado de velas en la bañera. Ahora yo tendré la oportunidad de disfrutar con ella este viaje. Podemos olvidarnos otra vez del mundo. - ¿Viajaras con Alex, Josh? - Ehh sip. Collins es parte de una sociedad de hoteleros de las Islas Malvidas. Nos invitó a pasar una semana en uno de ellos aprovechando una junta que celebran entre los propietarios, con la esperanza que alguno de ellos se sume a nuestra causa. - ¿Islas Malvidas? Waooooo. He escuchado que es hermoso. Todo un paraíso. ¿Y Alex consiguió permiso en su trabajo? – Quería preguntarle a Claudia como estaba tan enterada de la vida de Alex. - Si. Logró disipar su agenda. Incluso esta haciendo turnos extras, cambiando turnos de sus compañeras para tener libre esas 3 semanas. Estos últimos meses casi no nos vemos. No sabes lo decepcionado de no poder estar con ella ahí. Hubiera sido un lugar hermoso para pedirle que se case conmigo. - Yo creo que el lugar no importa. Deberías pedirle matrimonio lo más pronto posible. – Quería que Claudia cierre su boca. Por suerte Alex volvió y se sentó de nuevo en su lugar. - Casi no logro salir del baño, estaba repleto. – Dijo con una sonrisa. - Debía ir contigo. Como nuestra comida aun no llega creo que aprovecharé el momento – dijo Claudia levantandose. - Nunca entenderé a las mujeres. – dijo Darío. - Ja. Los hombres son más confusos. Sabes, se me acaba de antoja un helado de crema de los que venden enfrente – dijo señalando el local por la ventana – Quiero uno de mora y vainilla. - Vale. Ahora regreso. ¿Quieres un helado, Josh? - Estoy bien. – dije tratando de no sonar molesto. Espero que Darío se alejara antes de enfrentar a Alex. - ¿Este es tu asunto \"urgente\" por resolver? Si quería festejar tu aniversario con tu novio podías hacer menos drama para dejarme. - No empieces con reclamos, Joshua. Mi relación con Darío no es de tu incumbencia, ademas tú tampoco perdiste el tiempo recurriendo a Claudia. - ¿Esperabas que me encierre en mi departamento a esperar que te dignes a darme mas de tu tiempo? - No. – dijo enojada. – Pero no tienes que recurrir a ella, precisamente. - ¿Estás celosa? - ¿Celosa, yo? ¿De Claudia? Debes estar bromeando. - Entonces no entiendo porque tu aversión a ella. A tu novio parece caerle de lo mejor. - Sabes… prefiero que te calles. No quiero discutir contigo. Ademas no deberías estarme reclamando, estás rompiendo parte de tu trato. - Pues me vale mierda nuestro trato. - ¿Quieres terminar con esto? – dijo señalandonos – Pues bien, se acabo. Haz lo que quieras con esa… no me interesa tu vida Josh, pero agradecería que no te involucres en la mía. Estaba a punto de explotar por su esúpida actitud. Tomé su brazo fuertemente, ella trató de zafarme. – Esto no se acaba aquí, Alexandra. - ¿Pasa algo? – la voz de Claudia me hizo soltarla. - Nada. Solo estábamos ajustando detalles de nuestro viaje. Darío llegó luego de un momento con el famoso helado al mismo tiempo que nuestra comida. Alex y yo no hablamos mas de lo necesario durante el resto de la velada, solo cuando Darío y Claudia nos preguntaban algo, ya que ellos llevaban todo el peso de la conversación. La despedida fue tensa. Sabía que en dos semana estaríamos viajando juntos y otra sería la historia. Probablemente olvidaremos esta tonta discusión y nos dedicaremos al otro. Claudia trató de besarme cuando la dejé en su hotel. Su tono desilusionado cuando no se lo permití me lleno mas de cula. ¿Por qué no podía simplemente olvidarme de Alex y ser feliz con alguien más? ¿Qué me había hecho ella para que mi corazón y mi alma se aferraran de esa manera? Nunca tendría respuesta, de lo único que estaba seguro es que nunca dejaría de amarla. Hooola a todos.. les cuento que ya estoy de vacaciones.. agradezco a todos quienes me enviaron sus buenos deseos :) Quería emepzar a actualizar de nuevo 2 veces x semana pero esta vez tendrán que esperar hasta el miércoles xq hoy voy a dejar que desinfecten mi computadora y hasta q me la devuelvan y me ponga a escribir está largo :P Sin mas q añadir, como siempre agradezco sus reviews y espero q los sigan dejando con sus predicciones y comentarios :P Nos leemos luego :) .-.-.-.-.-..z3 Milet AVANCE: En dos semanas, Josh y yo estaríamos lejos de toda esta locura. Saldremos en un par de días. No quería arruinar nada. Quería esto. Por lo menos si mi vida se estaba esfumando quería tener cada segundo de toda la felicidad que podía obtener y sabía que solo Josh podía hacerme olvidar del mundo. – No se lo diga a nadie, por favor. - Deberías decir a tu familia. Necesitas su apoyo. Ello no sabrían nada. – Lo sabrán si el diagnóstico se confirma. No quiero preocuparlos. - Entiendo. Vendré mas tarde para la cirugía.[Chapter 98] Capítulo 98 - ¿Estás bien, Alex? Tenía nausea, mi cabeza daba vueltas, tenía frío y sentía que cualquier momento todo se volvería negro. – No, Ally. Me siento mal. Me ayudó a sentarme en alguna silla del corredor. Tocó mi frente y luego mi pulso. – Estás helada , taquicárdica y tu pulso es filiforme*. Déjame tomar tu presión. Sacó su tensiómetro de su bolso y me lo colocó. – Estas hipotensa, Alex. ¿Qué sucede? Mi mente estaba al límite de la inconsciencia, pero traté de responder. – Llevo con mi período mas de 10 días. Estoy perdiendo mucha sangre. Ayúdame por favor. – me sentía ansiosa. Mi mente nublada apenas notó que me llevaron a un hospital. Ally consiguió ayuda para trasladarme y ni bien llegué ella les explicó que al parecer tenía metrorragia* y me colocaron suero para reponer líquidos y medicación para que se deteniera mi sangrado. Le pedí que no llamara a nadie hasta saber que es lo que tengo. Una cara conocida vino a mi encuentro. – Alexandra. Siempre es un gusto verte pero me sentiría halagada si me visitaras sana. Sonreí. – Doctora Julianne. Creáme que a mí tampoco me gusta enfermarme. - Nos diste un buen susto. ¿Cómo dejaste que te pasara esto? - Muchas cosas en mi cabeza. Pensé que pasaría. Su mirada de reproche me hizo sentir mal. – Alexandra. Desde que te conozco has tenido anemia, has sufrido infecciones que una persona sana no debería sufrir. Ahora vienes con sangrado intenso y si mal no recuerdo estás tomando anticonceptivos por lo que esto no debería suceder. Eres médico, deberías preocuparte con tales signos de alarma. – Pasó su mano por mi brazo y su mirada se detuvo en mi moretón. - ¿Moretones? ¿Qué está sucediendo? Y fue cuando la cruda realidad me atravesó. No había querido pensar en que algo malo me sucedía. – Tienes anemia, tu coagulación no esta bien. Creo que sabes perfectamente lo que estoy pensando que tienes. La palabra resonaba por mi mente pero no podía decirla. Si lo hacía la realidad vendría sobre mí y aceptar que estoy muriendo me iba a destruir. – Yo… yo tuve leucemia cuando era niña. - ¿Aguda o crónica? ¿Linfocítica o mielocítica? – empezó a acribillarme con millares de preguntas sobre mi enfermedad. Traté de explicarle lo mejor que pude, intenté imaginarme que solo era alguien a quién le contaba mi historia no a una persona que me decía que estaba enferma de nuevo y que yo simplemente no quería verlo. - Leucemia mieloide crónica – dijo cada palabra como si intentara convencerse ella mísma – Es muy rara en niños. Esperemos que todo sea coincidencia y no hayas remitido. Cada palabra me estaba hundiendo como si el peso del mundo estuviera cayendo en mis hombros. Me puse a llorar sin poder evitarlo. ¿Quién no lo haría en mi caso? Julianne me abrazó y me aferré a ella mientras sollozaba. Mi vida se caía en pedazos, simplemente estaba destinada a terminar mal. Quizás ese era mi castigo por jugar con los sentimientos de otras personas. Quizás ese era mi castigo por engañar a mi novio, por no poder dejar ir a Josh. - Programaré una biopsia de médula lo más pronto posible, pero los resultados demorarán debido a que ahora todo ese tipo de exámenes lo enviamos a un laboratorio especializado y están teniendo ciertos problemas. Quiero verte en dos semanas. En dos semanas, Josh y yo estaríamos lejos de toda esta locura. Saldremos en un par de días. No quería arruinar nada. Quería esto. Por lo menos si mi vida se estaba esfumando quería tener cada segundo de toda la felicidad que podía obtener y sabía que solo Josh podía hacerme olvidar del mundo. – No se lo diga a nadie, por favor. - Deberías decir a tu familia. Necesitas su apoyo. Ello no sabrían nada. – Lo sabrán si el diagnóstico se confirma. No quiero preocuparlos. - Entiendo. Vendré mas tarde para la cirugía. Asentí y ella se fue. Traté de poner mi mente en blanco. Allyson entró en mi habitación. - ¿Te sientes mejor? - Si. Solo tuve un gran desequilibrio hormonal, pero todo está solucionado. - Me preocupaste mucho. Tu médico me dijo que pasarás aquí la noche para observación. - Sí. No se lo digas a nadie, Ally. No quiero preocupar a nadie. - Si es lo que quieres – dijo dudosa. - Te quiero, pequeña. ¿Podrías buscar mi celular? Cuando me lo entregó llamé a mi novio para decirle que tenía un turno inesperado hoy y que no llegaría a dormir. No preguntó nada y solo escuché como se lamentaba de no verme mucho ultimamente. Lo evitaba deliberadamente. Trataba de quedarme el menor tiempo posible a su lado. No le esperaba despierta o no llegabaa dormir en absoluto con excusa de algun turno. No quería su toque, no podía soportar su tacto en mi piel y mucho menos acostarme con él. Sabía que se frustraba pero era lo suficientemente bueno para no reprocharme nada. Me llevaron al quirófano y me hicieron todo el procedimiento para extraer médula de mi hueso iliaco. Pasé la noche pensando en todo lo que ha ocurrido mi vida. No me quedaba duda de que tendría que aprovechar cada segundo de lo que me quedaba y tampoco quería que nadie sepa de mi problema. Todo era mi culpa, un castigo, karma, cualquier cosa pero mi culpa a fin de cuentas. No pude dormir, solo llorar durante horas. La doctora Julianne fue la primera en aparecer al sigueinte día. - Veo que estás mucho mejor. Ni bien se detuvo el sangrado y con la reposición de líquidos tu presión arterial se estabilizó inmediatmaneto. No veo sentido tenerte aquí mas tiempo, pero si te sientes mal tienes que regresar. - Gracias. – era lo único que podía decir. - Vamos a hacer todo lo posible para que estés bien. Solo debes poner de tu parte. Insisto en que necesitas el apoyo de tus seres queridos, no puedes afrontar esto sola, Alexandra. Nadie puede hacerlo. - Se los diré si tengo que hacerlo. Gracias por dejarme ir tan pronto. Dejé que me retirara las agujas por donde me canalizaban los líquidos y busquá mi ropa. – En dos semanas hablaremos. – asentí aunque no pensaba volver en busca de los resultados. Prefería no saber la realidad. Si mi vida iba a terminar no quería pensar en ello cada minuto. – Una cosa mas. No anticonceptivos. Quizás para tratar la menorragia o metrorragia ayuden pero en tu caso si es lo que sospechamos solo puede acelerar un proceso que no queremos. Si el sangrado regresa tendremos que tomar otras medidas. Entendía perfectamente lo que decía. Luego de despedirme volví a mi departamento y me dispuse a descansar. No podía abusar de mi leve recuperación. No se cuanto dormí pero supongo que mucho porque ya había oscurecido nuevamente. A pesar de que no había provado bocado tampoco tenía hambre. Solo quería acurrucarme en mi cama y bloquear al mundo. Volví a quedarme dormida y me desperté cuando unos labios viajaban por mi cuello. – Hola, dormilona. Se había metido bajo las cobijas y pude darme cuenta que estaba desnudo. Sus manos se filtraban bajo mi ropa. – Tengo sueño, Darío. - Si sigo por este camino estoy seguro de que el sueño se te quitará. – su manos masajeaban mis senos. La sensación era horrible. Traté de apartarlo pero él seguí devorando mis labios con sus manos por todos lados. - Basta, Darío. No quiero. – sus manos iban a la cinturilla de mi pantalón. - ¡DÉJAME!. Se apartó de un golpe. Podía ver la furia en su mirada mientras yo acomodaba mi ropa. - ¿Qué diablos te sucede, Alexandra? - Nada. Solo estoy cansada. ¿Es tan difícil entender eso? - No es eso. Algo te sucede. Siempre estás cansada, siempre estás fuera, siempre excusas. Pareciera que cuando te toco sientes asco. Cuando te beso… pareciera que quieres salir huyendo. - No es así… - SI ES ASÍ. Ya no hablas conmigo, pasas metida en tu trabajo o en tu bendita empresa. Ya no puedo seguir de esta manera. Necesito a mi novia de vuelta. – gritó frustrado. Se acercó al armario y sacó un poco de su ropa. – Cuando decidas hablar conmigo, cambies tu actitud o te olvides cualquier maldita cosa que te haga comportarte de esta manera me buscas. Dio un portazo cuando se fue y escuché el golpe seco de otra puerta al cerrarse, suponía que era la habitación que usabamos para visitas que en un inicio estaba destinada para él. Abracé mis rodillas y me acurruqué en mi cama para llorar. Era lo uncio que podía hacer ahora. Llorar por mis pérdidas, llorar por lo que voy a perder y solo contemplar como mi vida se acaba. Darío me ignoraba completamente durante los siguientes días. Fer y Santy supusieron que era uan típica pelea de enamorados que pronto se solucionaría pero yo sabía que era algo más. Algo había muerto en nuestra relación, y no fue por nuestra discusión, es algo que ha venido sucediendo de poco a poco. Llegó el día del bendito viaje. No podía esperar salir de esto y olvidarme de este maldito mundo por un instante. Esperaba a Josh en la sala de embarque. Teníamos planeado hacer una escala en Dubai por cuestiones del vuelos y luego llegaríamos a nuestro destino. Mi mente quería vagar a mi situación. Trataba de bloquear todos esos pensamientos pero hacerlo consumía toda mi energía. Cuando volví a ser conciente de entornor me percaté de un grupo de chicas estaban amontonadas a un lado emitiendo chillidos. Estiré un poco mi cuello y encontré con la causa de tanta locura. Obviamente Josh Hutcherson causaba revuelo a todo lugar que iba. Muchas veces nos habíamos visto interrumpidos por alguna fanática que moría por tener su autógrafo o una foto. Muchas de ellas eran agradables, pero tambien muchas de ellas bailaban sobre mi cadaver en su imaginación. Su mirada encontró la mía y se abrió paso entre su club de fans para llegar a mí, obviamente siendo perseguido por toda ese grupito. – Hola, hermosa. Su saludo hizo que todas sus locas fans me mirran y no de una manera muy bonita. – Joshua. Él levanto su ceja. - ¿Joshua? ¿Estamos con formalidades de nuevo? Eso significa que sigues de mal humor. - Tú provocas mi mal humor. – Su grupito de fans pasaban sus miradas de uno al otro. - Bueno. Por suerte para mí tendremos mucho tiempo juntos que me dedicaré a compensarte y hacerte cambiar de humor. Iba a responder pero la primera llamada de nuestro vuelo se anunció asi que tomé me puse de camino al avión. Josh no pudo seguirme de inmediato ya que debía complacer primero a sus fanáticas. Me acomodé en mi asiento colocandome el cinturón de seguridad , aunque aun no despegaramos, y como siempre me dispuse a descansar. No sabía porque podía relajarme perfectamente durante los vuelos y al parecer estuve demasiado cansada porque me quedé dormida tan plácidamente que me perdí el despegue y varias horas de vuelo. - Despierta, pequeña.- sentí un breve sacudón – Vamos, Alex, necesitas comer. Medio dormida devoré la comida que Josh había acomodado en mi mesita y volví a dormir. Horas mas tarde me desperté envuelta por unos brazos y los sonidos de profundas respiraciones. Esto de acurrucarnos mientras dormimos se está volviendo costumbre auunque debo decir que es una costumbre muy placentera. Busque mi Reader y continué la lectura que tenía pendiente, depsues de todo no podía descuidar mis estudios a pesar de mis cortas vacaciones. Despues de otro par de horas de largo vuelo, Josh no había despertado y había annuncaido nuestra llegada a Dubai. Estaba muy emocionada de estar en un nuevo país y que decir de un nuevo continente a pesar de que no saldremos del aeropuerto. Empujé a Josh tratando de que despertará sin éxito. Los hombres podía dormir como piedras. – Josh.. – tironeé su oreja, un mechón de cabello y su labio inferior sacandolé un bufido pero aun sus ojos no se abrían. Lo tomé como algo personal así que mi dedos empezaron a hacerle cosquillas. Él solo de retorcía de un lugar a otro pero sus ojos seguían cerrados por lo que me vi obligada a buscar otra manera de despertarlo. Con suidado me senté a horcajadas de él, mis manos paseaban por su cuello y pude sentir como se estremecía bajo mi toque. No me di cuenta que él había sujetado mis caderas y de un movimiento nos giró a ambos dejandome atrapada contra el asiento y él sobre mi devorando mis labios en un beso que obviamente fue correspondido. Por primera vez agradecí que viajemos en primera clase donde los asientos solo eran para dos personas en lugar de tres porque él espectaculo que estabamos dando era lo suficientemente subido de tono como para que se le prohiba la vista a niños. La mano de Josh se filtró bajo mi playera y masajeo mi seno provocando que gimiera. Este chico me hacía perder toda cordura. – Mmmhmm – un carraspeo hizó que nos quedáramos congelados en nuetro lugar. – Deben colocarse los cinturones de seguridad, estamos por aterrizar. Nos quedamos en la misma posición hasta que la azafata avanzará a otro sitio. Cada uno volvió a su sitio. Me sentía tan avergonzada, podía sentir como el rojo invadía la piel de mi cuello y cara. Aterrizamos y nos dispusimos a desmebarcar. Fuimos los últimos pasajeros en salir. La azafata que nos había encontrado con las manos en la masa estaba esperando en la puerta de salida. Sus ojos brillaron con un destello de lujuria cuando vio a Josh. no pude evitar poner mis ojos en blanco y no me quedó desapercibido el guiño que Josh le dio de regreso. Maldito coqueto. Teniamos que esperar dos horas antes de que nuestro vuelo salga. Aproveché para ir al baño y refrescarme. Cuando regresé a la cafetería un trío de chicas estaban ocupando los asientos sobrantes de nuestra mesa con sus miradas perdidas en un muy entusiasmado Josh. Era tan imbécil y descarado que coqueteaba con medio mundo en mis narices y luego se atrevía a declararme su amor. Aunque mi bolso seguía en esa mesa decidí sentarme en otra y hacer mi pedido, luego iría por mi billetera. En algún momento Josh aterrizó en la silla a mi lado. - ¿Porqué tan sola, cariño? - ¿Ya te cansaste de ser el centro de atención? Me miró divertido. – Alguien está celosa. - Ya quisieras que estuviera celosa. Pero va a ser una alrgo viaje si cada vez que te encuentres con una chica les des una mirada de dormitorio. - ¿Mirada de dormitorio? – me miró con una gran sonrisa - ¿Leíste eso en otro libro? - Tal vez…- respondí. Su suspicacia hacía que mi enojo se evaporara. - Deberías saber que la única persona a quién le dedicaría una \"mirada de dormitorio\" eres tú. – susurró. – Eres la única que chica que quiero en mis sábanas envuelta en mis brazos y bañada de mis besos. No lo olvides. Cada una de sus palabras solo provocaban que quisiera sonreír y lanzarme a sus brazos, pero algo dentro de mí quería castigarlo. No le dirigí la palabra durante el vuelo. Ambos dormimos el resto del viaje. En verdad el cambio de horarios nos estaba debilitando. Aterrizamos en Malé que es la capital de Maldivas mientras estaba oscuro. Era una ciudad realmente hermosa. Pasaríamos la noche en un hotel en ese lugar y al siguiente día partiríamos a uno de los centros turíticos en otra de las islas. Nos dieron una habitación para cada uno pero no tenía sueño así que decidí ir por chapuzón en la piscina. Me coloqué mi traje de baño bajo una corta falda jean y una blusa de tirantes. Cuando llegué a la alberca me encontré con un glorioso y mojado Josh nadando. Se percató enseguida de mi presencia y me ofreció una de sus sonrisas matadoras. – Veo que estamos en la misma onda. - No podía dormir y quería relajarme. Me acomodé en una amaca y él se acerco nadando a mi lado. – Puedes quitar el aliento a cualquier hombre. - Mmmhmmm – murmuré tratando de sonar desinteresada. Salió del agua y se acercó a mí. Gotas caían sobre mi cuerpo mientras el trataba de cernirse sobre mí. Me levanté rapidamente esquivandolo. – Disculpa pero tengo que cambiarme. Quiero zambullirme. Esperé alguna astuta respuesta pero solo me encontré con sus tormentososo ojos mirándome con deseo. Tiré de mi blusa y la aventé a algun sitio. Con suma lentitud desabroché mi falda y la desplacé suavemente por mis piernas para aventarla junto a la bulsa. Podía escuchar su respiración agitada. No era la única que deseaba por tener mas del otro, pero por hoy tendría que contenerme. Salté al agua de un solo brinco y naée hasta el extremo opuesto saliendo rapidamente. La mirada de Josh haría que cualquier chica se sintiera como una diosa. Sus ojos intensos sobre mí despertaban más anhelo y enviaba calor a cada célula de mi cuerpo. Caminé rodeando la piscina y me acerqué a recoger mi ropa. Normalmente no soy tan atrevida pero me aseguré de que tenga una gran vista de mi trasero cuando me agaché por mis prendas. Luego caminé hacia la puerta de salida, dispuesta a regresar a mi habitación. Antes de atravesar el umbral, escuché a Josh decir: - Si quieres jugar con fuego, prepárate para quemarte. *Metrorragia: Hemorragia anormal q se produce en el útero. Hoooola :) ¿cómo están? No me maten x lo q esta pasando.. yo creo q se venía venir y en verdad esa siempre fue la dirección de la historia. ¿Que creen q sucederá?

Sus ojos se llenaron de alarma y tan rápido como apareció se esfumo. Pudo haber sido mi imaginación ya que no entendía la razón para que ella tuviera miedo de mi tía. - No contestes, por favor. Se acercó rapidamente a mi lado. - ¿Porqué?[Chapter 99] Capítulo 99 - ¿Sabes que te ves hermosa?- ronroneé detrás de ella. Lucía un delgado vestido de playa que deja ver su trae de baño por ser levemente tranaparente. Cuando bajé a desayunar, lo primero que vi fue su figura sirviendose un poco de fruta. Simplement no resistí envolver mis brazos a su cintura y susurrarle. – Bueno gracias, pero agradecería que no te tomes estas atribuciones conmigo. Me molestó su actitud y mi muy posesivo yo, la abrazó mas fuerte y besó su cuello. – No entiendo porque, si lo único que quiero es consentirte. - Vaya, gracias por tu consideración – dijo mientras se desplazaba por un poco de jugo – Pero realmente no es necesario y estás atrayendo mucha atención sobre nosotros. - No me importa. – pues era la verdad, no me interesaba lo que otros digan. - A mi sí, Joshua. – de alguna manera se escabuyó de mis brazos y se acomodó con su bandeja para servirse su desayuno. Me serví mi desayuno y me senté a su lado. – Te extrañé anoche. Una sonrisa quería tirar del borde de sus labios. – Vaya eso es novedad. - No lo creo. No te imaginas como deseé que vinieras a mi habitación y poder estrenar esa gran cama. Quería pobrar nuevas… formas de hacerte mía. - Si mal no recuerdo, nuestra aventurita terminó. Mi mano se aventuró en su muslo y subí acariciando la cara interna de su muslo. Sostuvo los cubiertos con fuerza tratando de reprimir un gemido. Conocía tan bien su cuerpo que sabía como provocarla. - ¿Vendrás conmigo esta noche? – mordí él lóbulo de su oreja. - Tal vez…- gimió llevando su rostro al mío para fundirnos en un descarado beso. Nuestras lenguas se encontraron en su ya conocida lucha por el dominio y mis manos ya estaban en sus caderas apretandola contra mí. - Vamos chicos, dejen los espectáculos para otro momento. – la risa de Ryan Collins nos separó.- Pero no pongan esas caras. Yo tambien se lo que es ser joven y estar enamorado. ¿Les importa si me siento con ustedes? Alex estaba completamente avergonzada pero Collins logró disipar esa tensión mientras nos ponía al día sobre todo lo que tendríamos que hacer. Cada uno se retiró para prepararse para el almuerzo ejecutivo donde mi chica tendría que dar un presentación sobre los programas y las formas de participación en la fundación esperando tener apoyo de estos grandes empresarios. Ver la forma en que se desenvolvía ante todos, como se concentraba para exponer sus ideas correctamente y la forma en que medía sus palabras para responder ante cualquier duda de alguna manera me pusó caliente. Esta chica podía ponerme caliente con culauqier cosa que ella hiciera. Varios de ellos estuvieron interesados y les repartí a cada uno una copia de todos los documentos para que puedan analizarlos con sus asesores. Ellos estarían en esta convención de hoteleros por unos días más y al final de esta nos darían su respuesta mientras nosotros. Por la tarde decidimos pasear por Malé. Era una isla muy pequeña, solo tenía 4 barrios a parte del aeropuerto, centro comercial y la cadena de hoteles. Las demas islas estaban llenas de cadenas de hoteles, cada una a su estilo, incluso algunas islas estaban completamente deshabitadas. Mientras hacíamos fila para comprar entradas para el Museo Nacional tomé sus manos entrelazando nuestros dedos y para mi sorpresa ella no los alejó. Pasear con ella de esta manera, como si fueramos una pareja normal en un día de paseo, se sentía tan familiar, tan normal y cálido como todas las veces en que nos olvidabamos del mundo y solo existimos nosotros. Ella me pidió ir a una farmacia asi que aproveché para comprar algunas bebidas que quería meintras ella compraba sus \"cosas femeninas\". Luego regresamos al hotel para recoger nuestras cosas ya que nos hospedaríamos en otra de las islas durante un par de semanas. Un hidroavión nos llevó a un paraíso llamado Isla Vaadhoo tan pronto bajamos del muelle fuimos recibidos por uan comisión de empleados enviados por nuestro afitrio. La isla no era grande pero lo suficiente para que nos tome varias horas recorrer todo su perímetro. - Jóvenes – dijo el gerente del hotel de la isla – es un gusto hospedarlos. No se quedarán en los bungalows que están observando – señaló a la cadena de cabañas sobre agua que se disponían a nuestro alrededor – El señor Ryan nos ha encargado que los llevemos a su bungalow privado al otro lado de la isla, espero que se encuentren muy a gusto en nuestras instalaciones, nosotros estamos a su servicio solo tienen que avisarnos lo que requieren. Agradecimos sus atenciones y luego de una muy larga caminata llegamos al otro lado de la isla a nuestra cabaña privada. Todo el paisaje era una maravilla, y cada detalle de este paraíso nos envolvía. Nos dejaron en la entrada antes de despedirse. Cuando los vimos desaparecer de nuestra vista me apresuré a tomar a Alex en mis brazos. – Bájame, Joshua. - Quiero hacer esto bien. Atravesar el umbral contigo en mis brazos es un sueño que quiero cumplir. - Se supone que eso lo haces cuando te casas no cuando estás de vacaciones. - Pues vamos a pensar que esto es una especie de luna de miel. Por un momento pensé que me mandaría por un tubo pero lo que hizo me sorprendió aún mas. Envolvió sus brazos en mi cuello y selló mis labios con los suyos en uno de esos besos llenos de significado, el cual no podía descifrar, un beso que no pide más, es uno de esos besos que es solo para disfruta la cercanía, el tipo de beso que le das a una persona que de verdad quieres. Atravesé con ella todo el puente de madera hasta la entrada de nuestra cabaña, fue un poco díficil abrir la puerta con ella en mis brazos pero de alguna manera lo hicimos. La dejé sobre sus pies una vez dentro mientras observabamos nuestro lugar temporal. La palabra que quería decir era \"hogar\" por que con ella me sentía de esa manera. - Genial. Esto es fabuloso. – Hizo un recorrido brincando de unlado al otro. El bungallow solo tenía una habitación, un baño, un pequeña sala y cocina. Todo muy acogedor. Fui tras ella cuando se perdió en la habitación. Había una gran cama enla habitación ademas de un armario. Una gran puerta de cristal daba paso a un pequeño balcón con un barandal de madera que se encontraba sobre el agua, dandonos una hermosa vista del mar. Ella miraba al horizonte, por un momento quería acercarme y estrecharla contra mí, pero me detuve cuando noté que su mirada estaba llena de tristeza. Tristeza, nostalgia, culpa, remordimiento… podía ser cualquiera de esos sentimientos pero sabía que no debí interrumpilar. Fui por nuestros equipajes en la orilla y regresé para acomodarlos en nuestra habitación. no habíamos hablado de nuestra última discusión y a mi parecer era lo mejor. Perdernos en nuestro propio mundo olvidando todo lo que sucedió antes y sucedería luego era lo que ambos necesitabamos. Solo queríamos un refugio en brazos del otro. Volvió a la habitación cuando yo guardaba nuestra ropa en el armario. Silenciosamente ella se unió a mi labor con sus cosas. No me gustaba el silencio. – Me robaste un beso. Por un momento dejó su tarea y me miró. – Si esa persona está dispuesta a dartelo no se considera un robo. - Me siento usado. – ella sonrío tontamente agitando su cabeza. – Necesito mi beso de regreso. Me miro divertida e hizo como si estuviera pensando. - Si le robas un beso a alguien, ¿cómo haces para devolvérselo? - Pues yo exijo que busques la manera de compensarme. - Creo que tienes demasiadas recompensas. Consigues todo lo que quieres. – por un momento se quedó callada y pude ver como la tristeza se filtraba en su alma. Quería preguntar porque estaba llena de esos sentimientos pero decidí no hacerlo. A veces es mejor no saber. - No tengo todo lo que quiero y mucho menos todo lo que necesito. – el ambiente se tornó serio y era lo que menos quería. – Lo único que quiero es que me beses. Definitivamente necesito ese beso de regreso a mis labios. Ella sonrío aunque aun notaba la tristeza en sus ojos. Se acercó a mí ahuecando mis mejillas y para posar sus labios en mi mejilla, en mi mentón finalizando en mi boca. Se retiro tan pronto como me besó para luego dirigirse a la cocina. Terminé con nuestras cosas antes de reunirme con ella para comer sus sanduches. Mientras limpiabamos todos decidí romper la tensión, asi que le sorprendí con cosquillas. Trató de huir mientras yo corría tras ella, ambos sumidos en risas. Como siempre termianos en el piso ella riendo y tratando de apartarme y yo con mis manos en sus costillas. – Basta, por favor… Decidí que era suficiente de cosquillas y la ayudé a ponerse de pie mientras aun le costaba respirar. – Te odio… - Bahh, no lo haces. - No pongas a prueba tu suerte, Hutcherson. - Admite que no vives sin mí – dije atrayendola por la cintura. Amaba cuando coqueteabamos de esta manera. - ¿Sabes? Si tuviera una pistola con dos balas y estuviera en una habitación con Hitler, Bin Laden y Tú… te dispararía dos veces. No pude evitarlo y me eché a reír en el hueco de su cuello. Ella siempre era ingeniosa. – Debería dejar de usar frases que lees. - No leí eso – dijo tratando de sonar seria, podía darme cuenta como retenía su risa – Lo vi en televisión. Ambos nos soltamos en carcajadas antes de iniciar una sesión intensa de besuqueo que fue interrumpida por el pitido de mi celular. Me aparté de ella para alcanzar mi telefono. – Es la tía Julianne. Sus ojos se llenaron de alarma y tan rápido como apareció se esfumo. Pudo haber sido mi imaginación ya que no entendía la razón para que ella tuviera miedo de mi tía. - No contestes, por favor. Se acercó rapidamente a mi lado. - ¿Porqué? Se tomó un momento para contestarme mientras mi celular seguía sonando. – Porque no quiero saber del mundo. Solo quiero que seamos tu y yo. Algo en mí se esperanzó por sus palabras. Ella me quería, de alguna manera ansiaba tambien esos momentos únicos que solo eran de nosotros. Tenía razón cuando decía que saber del resto del mundo solo arruinaría nuestra burbuja. Apagué mi teléfono y lo dejé donde estaba antes de concentrarme nuevamente en ella. Nuestros besos fueron tornándose intensos y suavemente estaba tirando de ella hacia la habitación. Cuando caímos sobre la cama ella nos detuvo. - ¿Qué sucede? - Tengo que darte algo. – Se puso de pie tan rápido y busco algo en el armario. Me sorprendí cuando me ofreció una caja de condones. - No entiendo – dije enojado. - Tienes que usarlos. No es dificil de comprender. Me dolió pensar que ella no quería tenerme de esa manera. En toda mi vida, solo con ella no he tenido que protegerme, y si lo he hecho fue porque ella me lo pidió. Nunca me importó si corríamos el riesgo de tener un bebé porque solo nos hubiera unido de una manera mas fuerte ¿y ahora que? ¿De repente se siente incapaz de entregarse a mí completamente? - ¿Por qué? - No metas a tu ego en esto – ella me conocía mejor que nadie. Obviamente sabía lo que pensé. – Solo no es momento para tener un bebé y… tuve que dejar los anticonceptivos… me hacía daño. Solo te estoy pidiendo que cuides de mí. – sus palabras calaron en mi corazón – Confío en ti Josh. Tú bien sabes que cuando estamos juntos pierdo completamente la cabeza y necesito que tú seas capaz de protegernos a ambos. Algo en su voz dulce y seria hizo que mi corazón se estremeciera. Tenía razón, debía protegerla. Tomé la caja a regañientes y la coloqué en el cajón de nuestra mesita junto a la cama. Ella me brindó una sonrisa antes de regalarme un pequeño beso en la mejilla. – Voy a preparar nuestra cena. Quiero pasear por la playa luego. Yo solo asentí y me dediqué a pensar en lo sucedido. Ella me pidió que la protegiera porque no quería tener un hijo. Pero un hijo de ambos era lo que yo más he querido en esta vida. Sabía que me amaba, estaba completamente seguro de que sus sentimientos por mí eran tan fuertes como los míos pero ella no quería aceptarlo y yo le he permitido que ella se esconda y no enfrente lo que siento. Temo por el momento en que ella se aleje completamente de mí solo por su obstinación y la pierda de una vez. Un hijo. ¿Podría ser una solución? Obviamente un hijo crearía un lazo indestructible entre nosotros. Un hijo nos vería obligados a vernos por siempre, un hijo nos ataría de alguna manera. Aunque ella no me quisiera en su vida, por ese hijo tendría que aceptarme cerca y eso me compraría tiempo para buscar la manera de retenerla para siempre a mi lado. ¿En verdad podría traicionar su confianza de esa manera? Los accidentes pasan, podría echarle la culpa a un condon roto o un descuido del momento, podría encontrar millares de excusas sobre lo sucedido pero en el fondo siempre sabré que yo fui el culpable. Soy consciente de que ella estaría enamorada de la idea de ser madre en el mismo instante en que lo supiera, pero mi corazón no quiere traicionarla. La amo, el amor no traiciona. Mis pensamientos van y vuelven a la idea. Alex me llama a cenar. Me hizo olvidar todo mientras nos sumíamos en una conversa divertida sobre frases de libros. Nos perdimos la puesta de sol. Me ofrecí a limpiar mientras ella se cambiaba de ropa. Tuvo la grandiosa idea de nadar por la noche. El ambiente caluroso hizó que me quitara mi playera solo para quedar en mis pantaloncillos para nuestro paseo. Ella salio en su traje de baño y como siempre que la veía de esa manera necesite de todo mi autocontrol para no saltar y llevarmela al dormitorio. Salimos de la mano a la playa para encontrarnos con el mas hermoso paraíso que jamas hemos visto. Las fotografías sobre el mas de las estrellas que habíamos visto en internet no tenía comparación esto. No podías diferenciar el cielo del mar. Parecía que había estrellas por todo lado en medio de la oscuridad. Las olas sonaban llenando el silencio de la noche y en la orilla con el movimiento de la marea se podía dislumbrar la luz dejada por el agua creando un margen de luz. - Hermoso – coincidí con su comentario, todo era tan subrealista. Ella tomó mi mano y tiró de mi hacia el agua. – Vamos. Su entusiasmo era totalmente contagioso. Corrí con ella por la orilla. Jugamos persiguiendo la olas sin atrevernos a entrar. Me sentía como un niño. No tenía presiones ni malos sentimientos, solo alegría. Ella hizo que cayera en la arena cuando me metió el pie. Tomé sus rodillas y la cargué sobre mi hombro mientras ella pataleaba. Nos metí a ambos en el agua fría. Auqnue el ambiente era totalmente cálido la corriente de agua era fría. Alex chilló cuando volvió a la superficie luego de sumergirla. Sujeté su cintura cuando intentó sumergirme a mí. Instintivamente enrolló sus brazos a mi cuello para fundirnos en una sesión de candentes besos. Me sentía en el mismisimo cielo. Pasamos toda la noche jugando en el agua y en la orilla. Para la madrugada, yacíamos en la orilla recostados, su cabeza en mi pecho son sus brazos envueltos en mí. Mi brazo doblado tras mi cabeza y el otro exploraba de arriba-abajo en su espalda. - Esto es maravilloso. - Es un paraíso. – ella seguía viendo al cielo – Son hermosas. - Solo son gigantes bolas de gas ardiendo a millones de kilómetros de distancia. Se echo a reír –Oh por Dios. ¿No acabas de citar a El Rey León, verdad? - Tal vez…- ella carcajeó mas fuerte – Oye… Pumba en un Jabalí muy sabio. Ambos reímos por un momento antes de de quedarnos callados por otro rato mientras pensaba en como decirle lo que siento. - No me refería solo al lugar. – Ella levantó su cabeza para mirarme. - Hablo del momento. Solo contigo compartiría esto. Solo contigo el mismísimo infierno me parecería un paraíso. El silencio nos envolvió y por un instante quisé tragarme cada una de mis palabras - Josh… - dijo lentamente – Hazme el amor. La calidez que me invadió con cada una de sus palabras era inexplicable. Había dicho \"Hazme el amor\", no sexo. Amor. De alguna manera volvimos al bungallow entre besos y caricias. Me detuvo cuando quise llevarla a la cama y nos llevó al baño para una ducha que duro mas de lo que debía en medio de nuestros besos. Envolví una toalla en su cuerpo para secarla e hizo lo mismo conmigo. Dejamos atrás el baño para sumergirnos en nuestro mundo. Nos metimos bajo las sábanas disfrutando el contacto de nuestra piel con la seda. Esta vez saboreamos cada segundo de nuestro contacto. Cada beso… Cada caricia… Cada mirada… Fue dulce cada contacto. Llegamos a estar excitados muy pronto a pesar de que nos tomamos nuestro tiempo. – Josh… te quiero dentro de mí, ahora. No tenía que pedírmelo de nuevo. Me posicioné para complacerla. Alcancé el preservativo que Alex había sacado del cajón luego de salir de la ducha. Vi aquel paquetito como si fuera el culpable de mis problemas. No lo era, pero también me daba la oportunidad de conseguir lo que quería. ¿Seré capaz de traicionar su confianza? No, pero… era mi única oportunidad. Rasgué ante su mirada el paquetito y fingí colocármelo. Para ese momento le había hecho perder la cabeza con mis caricias. No se daría cuenta. Nos sumergimos en nuestra armoniosa danza. Siempre mirándonos a los ojos, disfrutando cada toque. Bebiendo cada segundo. Ella llegó al éxtasis mordiendo mi hombro para ahogar su gemido y un segundo después lo hice yo gimiendo su nombre. Me puse de pie y fui al baño a dejar el preservativo \"usado\" y volví para aferrarme a ella. Escuché su respiración tranquila y supé que se había dormido. Había traicionado su confianza. La había engañado pero, la amaba como nadie nunca podrá hacerlo. Era mi vida, mi aire y lucharía por siempre por ella. El fin justifica los medios ¿no?. EN la guerra y el amor todo vale ¿verdad?. - Te amo… - dije al silencio mientras besaba su frente y trataba de dormir. Solo espero que lo que he hecho no me haga perder lo poco que tengo de ella. Hooooola :) Ahora si dejen sus reviews quiero saber q piensas... me pongo triste cuando no leo ninguno :/ como ven todo avanza más rápido y eso es xq la historia está próxima a terminar... quiero saber q creen q pasará.. se q estoy siendo cruel y la verdad q desde el incio de la historia esta planeado el engaño de JOsh y la enfermedad pero lo demás se fue dando con el desarrollo. Espero poder terminar de escribirla antes de q termine las vacaciones :) No estoy muy conforme de la manera q están quedando los caps pero espero q no les parezca aburridos :P Ansío leer sus reviews :) Nos leemos luego :) .-.-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: - No. Tienes que alejarte de mí, Josh. – ¿No entiendes que quiero que tengas a alguien? Quiero que tengas una vida, cuando yo me vaya, porque sé que me amas. Quería gritarle cada una de esas palrbas. – No puedo seguir con esto si sé que es todo lo que quieres. Esto debería ser una forma de… relajarnos, divertirnos, lo que sea. No debería ser la razón por la que vivimos. - Para ti soy solo un juego ¿eh? – se apartó de mí y empezó a vestirse. - ¿Tan insignificante soy que no merezco una oportunidad contigo?[Chapter 100] Capítulo 100 Brazos calientes me encerraban. Era una prisión pero estaba muy feliz de estar ahí. Josh dormía profundamente, sentía su aliento en la parte posterior de mi cuello. No quería dejar la comodidad que me rodeaba así que decidí aprovechar el momento un poco más. Recordé todo lo que sucedió la noche pasada. A diferencia de otras veces todo fue… suave. Creo que saboreamos cada segundo y nos tomamos tiempo para saborear cada sensación tal y como… nuestra primera vez. No debería haber dicho esas palabras ¿Hacer el amor? ¿En serio? No se puede hacer el amor si no se ama y yo ya no amo a Josh ¿verdad? Solo lo uso para olvidarme del mundo porque cuando estamos juntos somos fuego. - Hola – ronroneó Josh en mi cuello. Ni siquiera me di cuenta cuando había despertado. Sus manos empezaron a recorrer mi cuerpo. - Hora de levantarse, dormilón. – dije tratando de escapar de sus brazos pero él solo me apretó más aún. - Vamos. Sabes que quieres quedarte un rato más conmigo. Amas la sensación de nuestros cuerpos desnudos tanto como yo. - Ja. Ya quisieras que sea así. – Seguía intentando alejarme de su cuerpo – Ahora déjame salir. Pero Josh logró dejarme de espaldas en la cama y se cernió sobre mi cuerpo. De pronto hacía mucho más calor. - Eres una mentirosa – susurró mientras rozaba sus labios con los míos – Enfadona, caprichosa – su voz ahora era lenta y grave – Sexy y obstinada… pero igual me tienes loco – finalizó capturando mis labios. - Vaya que sabes como halagarme. Empezó a hacerme cosquillas y de alguna manera rodamos por la cama y el terminó bocabajo sobre el colchón y yo sentada a horcajadas sobre su trasero. – Oh Dios, he tenido muchas imágenes tuyas montandome de esta manera. - Eres un sucio – golpeé su cabeza lo que provoco su risa. De pronto sentí algo deslizandose por mi nariz. Pasé el dorso de mi mano por ella y se manchó de sangre. Me levanté de un brinco y me apresuré al baño. Tomé una de las toallas para detener la hemorragia. - ¿Estás bien, Alex? – Josh hablaba desde el otro lado de la puerta. Por suerte había cerrado con llave. - Estoy bien. – me acomodé en el piso y contra la pared, inclinando mi cabeza hacia atrás para disminuir el sangrado. Tenía miedo de que no se detuviera. Recuerdo que acudí varias veces a emergencia cuando era niña por epistaxis* descontroladas. Así fue como me diagnósticaron. - ¿Segura? – su voz notaba preocupación - ¿Necesitas algo? - No pasa nada – mi voz sonaba rara con la presión ejercida en mi nariz – Solo necesito unos minutos. Cosas de chicas. - Vale. – sonaba inseguro – Estaré en la cocina. Escuché sus pasos alejarse y cuando estuve segura de que no escucharía me eché a llorar. Relamente quería gritar y romper cosas, quería destruir todo, justo como me sentía. Todo caía en pedazos. Mordí un poco de la toalla para reprimir el grito y sollocé un poco más antes de tranquilizarme. Respiré hondo muchas veces tratando de tranquilizarme. Gracias a Dios el sangrado se detuvo. Me metí a la ducha para bañarme, de paso lavaría la toalla y no dejaría rastro de lo sucedido. Con un poco de delineador de ojos, no se notaba que había estado llorando. Fui al encuentro de Josh. Debía de olvidarme de todo, esa era la idea de este viaje, eso incluye la bendita leucemia. —TENGO HAMBRE. — Grité haciéndolo salar del susto. — Que susto. – dijo sosteniendo su pecho donde está su corazón. No pude evitar reír. —Soy espejo y me reflejo. —Que graciosita. Estaba preparando un poco de tocino. ¿Quieres? —Estoy a dieta, prefiero ensalada ¿Tienes?— Hice un mohín sabiendo lo ridícula que debo lucir. — Pues, si creo que tengo algo que te puede gustar. Tengo un gran pepino, Alexandra, con gusto te lo doy si es que quieres. – Sus ojos eran juguetones y sus cejas se elevaban de forma sugestiva. — Lo siento, pero he dicho que quiero un pepino, no un pepinillo, Joshua. Me miró ofendido —Que graciosita. — Debiste ver tu rostro, fue todo un poema. – No podía dejar de reír – Quiero el tocino. — No debería darte nada por ser una niña tan mala. Me puse de pie a su lado – Quiero mi tocino – y otra vez hice pucheros ridículos. Josh sonrío y me sirvió mi desayuno. Y así pasaron nuestros días, todo era natural. Como si llevaramos años haciendo esto de dormir juntos, pasar el día iguales, cocinar para el otro y tener largas charlas de cosas sin importancia. Sus labios estaban por todo lado cuando desperté de mi largo sueño.- Basta Josh. me haces cosquillas. - Abre los ojos y me detendré. – hice lo que pidió y me sorprendí verlo tan sonriente. Escaneé por un minuto la habitación y me encontré con un pastel. – Feliz Cumpleaños. Ahora eres oficialmente una chica de 25 años. - Se supone que una chica debe ocultar su edad, no celebrar que se hace mas vieja y arrugada. - Ni aunque tuvieras cien años dejarías de ser hermosa. La belleza de tu alma se reflejaría. – sus palabras hicieron que mi corazón se hinche. Posé mis labios en su mejilla lo que le hizo sonreír. - Vaya, es bueno saber que estás feliz en tu primer cumpleaños a mi lado. – su voz tenía un poco de duda. - ¿Primero? – traté de recordad haber festejado mi cumpleaños con Josh. - Si. Siempre arruiné las cosas antes. – la tristeza de sus palabras me hizo estremecer a pesar del calor. - El año pasado me diste un llamador de ángeles. Aún lo conservo. Es…– El mejor regalo que alguien me ha dado. – precioso. - Por lo menos alguien puede cuidarte cuando yo no este cerca. – me envolvió en un fuerte abrazó – No se que sería de mí si algo te sucede. Me tensé. Por un momento me pregunté si sabía mi situación. Quizas habló con Julianne y ella le dijo, pero él me prometio aíslarse del mundo. – Prefiero tenerte lejos aunque eso me mate lentamente a perderte definitivamente. Te amo. - No digas eso, por favor. – No me refería al \"Te Amo\". Me gusto escuchr eso. Me refería a sus palabras sobre estar perdido sin mí. Muy pronto tendría que vivir esa vida y no podía soportar si él no siguiera adelante por mi culpa. - Lo siento, pero es cierto. Te amo mas que nada. Te amo y nunca dejaré de hacerlo. Te amo, Alexandra. Lo único que quiero es que seas feliz, no importa si no es a mi lado. - Josh, yo … - pusó un dedo sobre mis labios. - No es necesario que digas nada. Solo prométeme que un día hablara conmigo sobre lo que tenemos.- Sus ojos eran suplicantes, si supiera que ese \"algun día\" quizás no llegue. - Lo prometo. – Mentira. El resto del día fue igual de especial que los otros. No podía entender como de fácil era para nosotros olvidarnos del mundo. Por lo menos para mí el era la causa de que mi mundo se desvaneciera, se volviera feliz. Josh hizo que el día de mi cumpleaños valiera cada minuto. Pero los días pasaron demasiado rápido. Estabamos de regresó en Malé para recibir respuestas de nuestros posibles nuevos donativos. Gracias al cielo tuvimos mas respaldo del que esperabamos. Nuestro vuelo salía en la mañana y está era nuestra última noche. Terminé de darme una ducha dispuesta a dormir cuando un par de golpecitos sonaron en mi puerta. Sonreí, sabía que debía ser Josh. Abrí la puerta y me encontré con su sonrisa coqueta. Todo su cuerpo apoyado contra el umbral. - Vienes por mas acción ¿eh? – el brillo travieso de sus ojos me atravesó. - ¿Piensas que los hombres solo piensan en sexo? – entró cerrando la puerta tras él. - No. – dije terminando de secar mi cabello – Tambien piensan en cerveza. Se echó a reír mientras se recostaba contra la puerta y cruzaba sus brazos. Sexy. - Tú y tu boca inteligente. Recogí mi cabello con un moño. – Espero que hayas estado pensando en mí mientras te duchabas. El tono grave de su voz enviaba millares de oleadas por mi cuerpo. – Si, pensé en ti. – sus labios estaban en mi cuello - Hay otra cosa que estuve pensando mientras me duchaba. Gimió - Ten piedad de mí, mujer. No insinúes que piensas en mí mientras te duchas. Soy solo un hombre y esas cosas me hacen reaccionar. – señaló su entrepierna ya abultada. - Eres un sucio – le dije riendo y dándole una palmada al Pequeño Joshi sobre su pantalón. - Y eso te encanta porque tú – dijo dando un beso en mi nariz – Eres una pequeña sucia también y adoras que te hablen sucio. – Sus manos deshicieron el nudo de mi bata. – Te vuelve loca que te digas todas sesas fantasías sucias que quiero hacerte. – Sus manos ahora viajaban por mis muslos y mis caderas. Gemí cuando sus caricias llegaron a mi intimidad. – Y lo que más te hace perder la cabeza es que te haga vivir cada una de esas \"cosas sucias\". Este chico me volvía loca. Suavemente me empujó al colchón donde me dejé caer de espaldas. -¿Cuánto miden tus piernas?- sus labios estaban en mi tobillo. - No tengo idea. No es información que necesite saber. - Mmmm. No estoy seguro. Será mejor medirla. - Sus labios besan mi tobillo – Uno. - ¿Estás midiendo mis piernas con besos? - Dos – dio luego de besar donde terminó el beso anterior. Él seguía dejando besos en mi pierna. - ¿De dónde sacaste esa unidad de medida? - Contigo todo es posible si se trata de besos. – continuó su recorrido añadiendo ciertos lametones haciendome retorcer de cosquillas. – 26 besos. Nada, nada mal. Sacudí mi cabeza reprimiendo mi gran sonrisa – Ven aquí sucio y haz lo que viniste a hacer. Terminamos en mi cama luego de incontables calientes y \"sucios encuentros\". La oscuridad se iluminaba tenuemente, señal de que el sol estaría próximo a salir y nosotros no habíamos dormido nada. Por suerte nuestro vuelo sería largo. La lengua de Josh hizo contacto con la piel de mi hombro. – Ahora no soy él único sucio. Bufé. – Debiste darme una advertencia. Perdí mi tiempo con el baño y secando mi cabello. - Auch – dio sobándose el brazo – No me maltrates. - Eres un quejica. - No lo soy. – Iba a contradecirlo pero decició callarme con un beso. Nos quedamos en silencio acurrucados mientras el amanecer nos envolvía. – Dijiste que estabas pensando en algo cuando te duchabas… - Si…- No quería hablar de ello. El mundo volvía a estar sobre mis hombros. - Dime. – Su cuerpo estaba bocabajo, abrazado a mis caderas con su cabeza en mi vientre. - Josh… No quiero perder esto. Cuando estoy contigo olvido el mundo y en verdad es… genial. – No encontraba las palabras correctas – Pero no puede seguir si tú te sigues aferrando a mí o esperando algo que no voy a corresponder. No puedes continuar con escenas de celos, no puedes seguir declarándome tu amor. - Pero… - No, Josh. Podemos seguir haciendo esto pero tú tienes que tener una vida en la que yo no esté involucrada. Busca a una chica – aunque eso me maté de celos – con quien puedas estar y planear a largo plazo. Alguien con quien puedas casarte, tener hijos…. No sé. Pero necesitas a alguien. - Te necesito a ti – sus palabras susurradas fueron un puñetazo a mi corazón. - No. Tienes que alejarte de mí, Josh. – ¿No entiendes que quiero que tengas a alguien? Quiero que tengas una vida, cuando yo me vaya, porque sé que me amas. Quería gritarle cada una de esas palrbas. – No puedo seguir con esto si sé que es todo lo que quieres. Esto debería ser una forma de… relajarnos, divertirnos, lo que sea. No debería ser la razón por la que vivimos. - Para ti soy solo un juego ¿eh? – se apartó de mí y empezó a vestirse. - ¿Tan insignificante soy que no merezco una oportunidad contigo? Iba a decirle que ese no era el caso, pero no podía hacerlo sin encontrar una respuesta lo suficientemente convincente. Él tomó mi silencio como una afirmación a su acusación. – Vale. Entendí. Solo sirvo para sexo, no soy lo suficiente para ti como para que puedas amarme. - No es así, Josh. – tomé su brazo per él lo apartó bruscamente como si mi contacto lo hiriera. - Es así y ¿Sabes qué? Seguiré tu consejo, buscaré a alguien que si me amé pero lo haré cuando me plazca. Y aunque me quiera negar se que esto entre nosotros seguirá pasando asi que no te preocupes por perder a tu juguete. La fuerza con la que azotó mi puerta al salir provocó un estruendo que nubló mis oídos. Nuevamente las lágrimas se desplazaban por mi rostro. Últimanete todo lo que hacía era llorar. Pero él no entendía y yo no podía decírselo. Me estaba muriendo y no podía permitir destruir la vida de nadie a mi paso. Aunque él me ame y por esa misma razón no podía dañarlo. El vuelo de regreso fue totalmente frío. Josh no me hablaba y su mirada era vacía. Quería que me abrazara, quería sentir el calor de su cuerpo al estrecharme, pero me ignoró todo el camino. Ni siquiera habló conmigo mientras esperabamos nuestro vuelo de Dubai a EEUU. Era de noche cuando llegamos a Boston. Una torrencial lluvia nos rodeaba. Hasta el cielo reflejaba mi confusa vida. Tomé aire antes de habalrle. – ¿Nos vemos el lunes en la oficina de Peter? Se estremeción con mi voz. – Steven ira para firmar lo que necesitas. Yo… viajaré a Kentucky unos días. - Oh… - mi voz se quedó atrapada. Me sentía herida. Él quería alearse de mí, que era justo lo que debía hacer pero mi corazón dolía con su desición. Creo que mi rostro debió darle una señal de como me sentía porque su ceño se suaviso. – Necesito un poco de tiempo, pero estaré de regreso. Besó mi frente antes de caminar delante de mí y alejarse. Mi vida seguía cayéndose a pedazos y no podía hacer nada para reponerla. Hoooola :) No puedo quedarme mucho pero como siempre solo quiero agradecer sus reviews y pedirles que dejen más donde me digan que els parece y q creen q sucedera? La historia está proxima a terminarse y en verdad agradezco tanto por leerla hasta este punto. Creo q he escrito 2 historias en 1 :P Actualizaré lo más pronto :) Nos leemos luego :) .-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET pd: La historia está publicada en wattpad :) www_wattpad_com/user/Milet7393 AVANCE: – Ally. – contesté cortesmente. – ¿Alex está contigo? – su pregunta me dejó helado. – No he hablado con ella desde que volvimos de Malvidas hace más de un mes. – Vaya. ¿Problemas en el paraíso? Ignoré su comentario. – ¿Qué sucede? – No la encuentro. No la he visto en toda la semana.[Chapter 101] - ¿Has hablado con ella? – preguntó mi mamá mientras me servía el desayuno. - No. – me ha costado mucho no llamarle, buscarle, saber de ella. Practicamente he pensado en que estará haciendo, si estará con él, si me extrañará, si por lo menos uno de sus pensamientos están dirigidos a mí. – Ella debería buscarme. Si me quiere lo hará. - Oh vaya – puso frente a mi un omellete - ¿Dónde quedó el chico no-puedo-vivir-sin-ella? ¿Te rendiste? - No - aunque debería – Solo… ya no sé que más hacer, mamá. Ya no tengo idea de como conquistarla, de como hacer que se quede conmigo. Necesito que me elija. A mí. ¿No valgo lo suficiente como para que ella me ame? Quería llorar. No era solo frustración, era dolor… puro, puro dolor. Mi mamá se acercó a mí y me abrazó. Lloré. Hace mucho tiempo que no lo hacía, pero estaba lleno de tantos sentimientos, tanta inseguridad, tanta pena y dolor, tanta desesperación. Muy pocas personas me han visto de esta manera y una de ella es mi madre, la otra \"mi chica\". Romperme de está manera de alguna forma me hacía sentir… mejor, de alguna forma es como volver a respirar luego de que pude sacar todo, pero el hecho de llorar era lo que no me hacía sentir precisamente bien. – Shhhh, Tranquilo – mi mamá secó con sus pulgares mis lágrima y me hizo mirarla. – No tienes que conquistarla, ella está tan enamorado como tú de ella solo que no se da cuenta. Vales mucho, Josh. Llegará el momento en que se de cuenta del error que está cometiendo. – ¿Cuándo será eso? Cuando tenga 80 años y tenga nietos con otro tipo. No importa la veces que le diga que la amo, ella solo quiere usarme para sexo. Nunca es sexo, por lo menos para mí. Ella quiere que busqué a alguien más, y no puedo, ella es la única a quien quiero y no se cuanto durará lo poco que tenemos. Temo el día en que me diga que se acabó. ¿Cómo viviré sin ella? – Si algo he aprendido en esta vida es que las cosas suceden por algo. Cada situación por más difícil que sea solo es para cumplir una misión. Muchas de ellas te hacen más fuerte y quizas esa es la razón para que lo ustedes sea tan complicado. Si llegan… cuando lleguen a estar juntos su relación será indestrutible. – Asentí no muy seguro. – Ella te ama, Josh. Yo se que tú estás desesperado por encontrar esa seguridad de que no la perderás pero ponte un segundo en sus zapatos. Tú vives en un mundo donde las apariencias son todos y muchas personas solo buscan de ti la manera de sacar beneficio. Ella salió de su zona segura, de una relación estable y de una vida tranquila, para aventurarse en una relación problemática. Se enamora perdídamente solo para enterarse que su novio la usó como escalon de fama y encima se acostó con otra chica. Eso la destrozó. Alex trató de rehacer su vida, olvidando todo lo malo y de un momento a otro tú vuelves y haces un caos de su existencia. Le confundes. No puedes esperar que ella se arriesgue por ti nuevamente. Es una persona y tiene miedo del daño, además ella no quiere hacer daño a más personas con sus decisiones. ¿Qué harías tu en su caso, Josh? Con la mano en el corazón ¿Te arriesgarías? Entendí su punto. Ni yo se lo que hubiera hecho en su lugar. – No sé. – Las personas no somos conocidas precisamente por tomar desiciones acertadas. Solo desesperadas, las que nos parecen mejor en el momento. – ¿Qué hago mamá? – esa era la pregunta que quería saber. – Paciencia. Es lo único que debes tener. El tiempo pondra cada cosa en su lugar. Y no basta con que le digas que la amas. Un hecho vale mas que mil palabras. Mi madre era sabia. – Te quiero mamá. – Dije dandole un abrazo. Mi celular sonó en ese momento. – Ally. – contesté cortesmente. – ¿Alex está contigo? – su pregunta me dejó helado. – No he hablado con ella desde que volvimos de Malvidas hace más de un mes. – Vaya. ¿Problemas en el paraíso? Ignoré su comentario. – ¿Qué sucede? – No la encuentro. No la he visto en toda la semana. Nuestros turnos no son los mismo y se que aun asiste a ellos pero no a clases en la mañana. Había estado preocupada por ella pero muy ocupada. Decidí buscarla en su apartamento hoy. Fer me recibió con la noticia que desde que ustedes volvieron, ella se está quedando con Peter. No volvió a su apartamento y no quiso decir a nadie el porqué. Aunque Fer asegurá que es porque tuvo una pelea con Darío. Debió ser algo grande. – tomó una respiración – Su celular está apagado. No se a quien llamar ara preguntar por ella. Pensé que quizas estaría contigo. – No lo está. – Un mal presentimiento se asentó en mi pecho. – Salgo hoy para Boston, te llamo en cuanto sepa algo. Me despedí de Ally y rapidamente empecé a empacar. Mi mamá solo me ayudo, ella siempre me apoyaba incluso sin preguntar. El viaje fue corto. Apenas llegué a mi apartamento llamé a Peter. – ¿Dónde está? – Hola, Josh. ¿Cómo estás? Yo muy bien, gracias por preguntar. – el tono burlón de su voz me hizo enfurecer. – Ella está conmigo. – ¿Está bien? ¿Porqué no ha ido a clases? – sueno como un acosador. – Veo que estás muy informado. No se ha estado sintiendo muy bien, por las mañanas. Quizás una infección, pero esta bien. – Quiero verla. – Me lo esperaba. Hoy es su día libre y se que estará todo el día en casa. – Gracias, Amigo. – No me lo agradezcas. Necesita salir de ese estado de ánimo y algo me dice que quizas tú eres el único que puede hacerlo. Te envió un mensaje con el código de acceso. Sus palabras me llenaron de calidez y de alguna forma, de alivio. Llegué lo más rapido posible a su departamento, el guardia me dejó pasar. Tomé una gran bocanada de aire antes de ingrsar el código en el panel junto a la puerta que me dio paso. Había estado aquí otras veces, pero por primera vez sentí que el silencio que me rodeaba me asfixiaba. Me dirigí a las habitaciones, habían tres, una de ellas de Peter. Me asomé en una de invitados e inmediatamente me vi envuelto en un perfume conocido. La puerta del baño estaba cerrada y el sonido de la ducha me indicó que había escogido la habitación correcta. Me senté nerviosamente en el borde de su cama. Solo saber que pronto la volvería a ver me llenaba de nervios, cosa que era ridícula porque solo la había visto hace un poco mas de un mes, pero recordar lo difícil que había sido estar lejos de ella me hacía no quere volver a vivir esa pesadilla. Cuando salió envuelta solo en una corta toalla que apenas cubría las partes más importantes, me toco usar toda mi fuerza de voluntad para no lanzarme sobre ella. Estaba sorprendida de encontrarme ahí, que por un momento le vi tratar de formular palabras sin lograrlo. – ¿Qué haces aquí? – Necesitamos hablar. – Aunque no sabía precisamente que ibamos a decir. – Si, pero no es el momento, Josh. Necesitas irte. Ahora.– La urgencia con la que pedía que me fuera me causaba un fuerte dolor en el pecho. – ¿Por qué? – Porque sí. Josh por favor, te prometo que hablaremos sobre todo lo que quieras pero tienes que irte. Por favor. – me suplicó. Parte de mí quería exigir una respueta mas explicativa pero por esta vez haría lo que me pedía, después de todo conseguí que aceptara hablar conmigo. – Solo quiero que las cosas sigan como lo han estado haciendo. – Si, lo sé. Es algo que ambos necesitamos... Ya hablaremos.– me sentía frustado por su necesidad de alejarme. Di la vuelta y apoyé mi frente en la pared tratando de tranquilizarme y hacer caso a su petición.– Josh, yo.. La puerta a mi lado se abrió un poco y la voz de Darío se hizo presente. – Alex. Ya estoy aquí. – La ira y el dolor empezarón a fluir por toda mi sangre. Ella seguía escogiéndolo a él sobre mí. Solo quería que me largara para poder estar con él. Gracias a que me encontraba a un lado, tras la puerta que Darío no se percató de mi presencia. Los ojos de Alex se dispararon de angustia. Me miró y luego a él. Se acercó rapidamente a la puerta y estampó sus labios con los de él. Darío no tardó mucho en colocar sus manos por todas partes del cuepo demi chica. Quería golpearlo, sacar toda la mierda de él por tocarla de esa manera. Ambos siguieron su ruta dentro del dormitorio. Estaba a punto de gritar cuando la mano de Alex se sacudió indicándome que pudiera salir. Me detuve un momento cuando la mano de Darío acariciaba el muslo de ella. Tomó todo de mí salir de esa habitación. Casi de inmediato la puerta se cerró fuertemente como si sus cuerpo hubieran chocado contra ella lo que probablemente sucedió. Debía largarme de ahí, pero mi muy masoquista corazón quiso escuchar lo que pasaba. Los besos cesarón porque sus voces llenaron el silencio. – No pensé que aceptaras verme luego de lo estúpido que fui. Y no puedo creer que me tomara dos meses para reaccionar. – Tal vez me enteraría porque estaban distanciados. Parte de mí anhelaba que yo fuera el culpable. – Escúchame, por favor. Fui un completo imbecil. Nunca debí tratarte de esa manera y mucho menos exigirte que me demuestres lo que sientes por mi. Nuestra relación siempre ha sido algo más que solo sexo. No es excusa, pero me estaba volviendo loco. Parecía que te estaba perdiendo, ya no querías estar conmigo y en verdad extrañaba tenerte de esa manera. Se que estuve siendo paranoico porque me parecía que cada beso y caricia que te daba te hací querer salir corriendo, pero mi mente solo viajaba en que quizás ya no me amabas más. – pudé escuchar como tomaba aire. – Lo siento. Por ser alguien que no mereces, lo siento por mis inseguridades, pero temo perderte. Y tú… estabas pasando mucho tiempo con Josh y eso me estaba volviendo loco. Tenía que quedarme callado y no decir nada pero en mi interior sabía que solo era miedo de que si preguntaba, admitieras que quieres estar con él y dejarme. – No sabía que te sentías de esa manera – la voz de Alex era calmada pero estaba teñida con tristeza. Sabía que era la culpa que la atravesaba. – Lo siento por no detenerme a pensar en ti. No volvera a suceder. – Te amo ¿Si? – No hubo más palabras, apenas escuchaba el sonido de sus besos y se que probablemente estarían a un paso de acostarse. Mis manos se volvieron puños y tuve que salir corriendo de ese lugar. No podía tenerlos cerca de esa manera. No podía quitarme las imágenes que bailaban en mi mente sobre ellos haciendo el amor. Compartiendo lo que ella y yo teníamos. Quería olvidar todo, al menos por un instante. Necesitaba sacarme de la cabeza a ella y solo conocía una forma. Estacioné en el bar mas cercano y entré apresurado. Me hice dueño de una cabina y un par de botellas de whisky que se fueron vaciando rápidamente. Desde que la conocí nunca había sido tan feliz y tan miserable en mi vida. Cada lágrima, cada sonrisa, ¿en verdad vale la pena tanto dolor? Sabía la respuesta aunque no era exactamento lo mas sano y cuerdo. El amor… ella valía totalmente la pena. Y saber eso no me hacía sentir precisamente mejor. Después de todo, pareciera que el amor es como un accidente, si no te mata, sales herido. Siempre siempre daño. Es como la guerra, duele cada batalla pero nunca dejas de luchar. Puede que al final alguien gane, pero siempre habrán pérdidas. Y este momento yo soy quién está destruido. Yo soy quien está perdido. Por un momento medité cada cosa y el millar de preguntas volvían a mi cabeza pero todas se centraban en una: ¿Me ama?. Sería suficiente saber lo que siente. Si no lo hiciera, tendría que renunciar a ella, pero si es feliz yo también lo soy. Regresé a todos lo eventos de esta noche. A cada palabra que ambos dijeron y caí en cuenta en el problema que habían tenido. Todo era porque no había estado juntos. Ella no ha dejado que élla toque y mi muy aburdo corazón crece al pensar que se debe a mí. Si es así ellos no han estado juntos desde navidad. Cada palabra ahora parece definitiva, cada acción pareciera que nos lleva al límite y con todas esas cosas aún hemos estado juntos. ¿No debería ser esa una señal? Nos conocimos hace un poco mas de 5 años y nuestros caminos se han cruzado y separado varias veces. ¿El destino nos quiere juntos o separados? Lo único que deseo es que el dolor termine porque siento que… ya no puedo más. Saqué mi celular y me costó mucho buscar su número. Definitivamente estaba ebrio pero eso no me impediría buscarla. Tenía que verla, tenía que responderme muchas preguntas y no soportaba una segundo más de saber que ella está con él. Hooola :) pueden creer q quiero subir este corto capítulo desde el miércoles? Bueno aquí lo tienen y agradezco muuucho sus reviews.. no saben como me alegra leerlos :P Como siempre quiero saber que piensan que pasará,,, cómo serán los eventos futuros? Espero poder actualiza máximo el lunes.. creanme q les gustará el nuevo cap :P Nos leemos luego :) .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-Z3 MILET AVANCE: – Quiero verte ahora. Por favor, no… no me dejes. – Parecía que sollozaba y saber eso me estaba hundiendo en tristeza. – No puedo, Josh. Hablaremos en otro momento. – Espera – gritó – Si no hablas conmigo ahora te juro que ire en busca de Darío y le diré todo. Maldita sea, eso es lo que debería hacer, pero te estoy dando uns salida, la tomas o la dejas. – No podía creer que me estaba amenazando. Maldito idiota. – Voy en camino. Estoy entrando en mi auto.[Chapter 102] Capítulo 102 Apenas Josh salió de la habitación empujé a Darío contra la puerta para cerrarla. Esperaba que Josh se hubiera ido enseguida, pero no podía arriesgarme a que Darío lo encontrara aquí y mucho menos conmigo solo cubierta por una toalla y con Josh derramando sus sentimientos. Darío besaba mis labios y muy a mi pesar lo correspondía. Sus manos ávidas estana por todo lado e iban en rumbo a algo que tenía que evitar. Se separó de mis labios por un momento y junto nuestras frentes. – No pensé que aceptaras verme luego de lo estúpido que fui. Y no puedo creer que me tomara dos meses para reaccionar. – Me había llamado está llamada y rogado que habláramos. Le dije que si y el di el código de acceso. – Escúchame, por favor. Fui un completo imbecil. Nunca debí tratarte de esa manera y mucho menos exigirte que me demuestres lo que sientes por mi. Nuestra relación siempre ha sido algo más que solo sexo. No es excusa, pero me estaba volviendo loco. Parecía que te estaba perdiendo, ya no querías estar conmigo y en verdad extrañaba tenerte de esa manera. Se que estuve siendo paranoico porque me parecía que cada beso y caricia que te daba te hacía querer salir corriendo, pero mi mente solo viajaba en que quizás ya no me amabas más. – Eso era lo que sucedía, no sabía exactamente que sentía y no quería desperdiciar lo que queda de mi vida en tratar de descubrirlo. – Lo siento. Por ser alguien que no mereces, lo siento por mis inseguridades, pero temo perderte. Y tú… estabas pasando mucho tiempo con Josh y eso me estaba volviendo loco. Tenía que quedarme callado y no decir nada pero en mi interior sabía que solo era miedo de que si preguntaba, admitieras que quieres estar con él y dejarme. Claro, que dudaba de Josh. fui ingenua al pensar que lo había superado, auqnue siendo realista tenía todas las razones. – No sabía que te sentías de esa manera. Lo siento por no detenerme a pensar en ti. No volvera a suceder. De verdad lo sentía, porque al parecer no me detengo en pensar en nadie cuanto tomo mis decisiones aunque yo creía que sí. – Te amo ¿Si? – sus labios volvieron a estar sobre los míos de una manera dulce. Y traté de dejarme llevar por el beso. Tal vez si encontraba mis verdaderos sentimeintos por él, tdo volvería a estar en su lugar. Pero se sentía tan, tan incorrecto besarlo. No podía solo olvidarme de Josh, de cada caricia, de cada beso, cada de broma y de cada instantes juntos. Sería mas fácil si yo tambien pudiera dejarlo ir. La mano de Darío tiraba de mi toalla y tuve que detenerlo. – No quiero pelear, no quiero que dudes, pero no me siento bien como para hacer esto ahora. Tomó un lento suspiro pero sonrío. – No hay problema con eso. Me conformó con sostenerte en mis brazos. ¿Estás bien? Ally está muy preocupada contigo desde que no has ido a clases. - Solo me he estado sintiendo un poco enferma. Creo que contraje algún virus estomacal. Practicamente devuelvo toda mi comida y siento como si fuera a desmayarme. - Oh. ¿No deberías ir al médico? – lo miré inquisitivamente – Ok. eres médico. ¿No deberías medicarte? - Normalmente los virus cumplen su ciclo vital y desaparecen, solo estoy esperando por eso. - Te ves cansada. ¿Te parece si voy por algo que podamos comer y luego dormir? Asentí y él se disparó por la puerta. Decidí vestirme con ropa abrigada y cómoda. Me entretuve leyendo mientras Darío regresaba. Trajo hamburguesas para cada uno. Apenas abrió la bolsa y el olor grasoso se filtró en mi nariz que me apresuré hacia el baño antes de que todo mi estómago se derramara en el cuarto. No tomó mucho para que el vómito se detuviera. Darío me paso una toalla húmeda para que me limpiara y me llevó a la cama. Su mano acariciaba mi frente y fue lo último que recordé antes de quedarme dormida. Me deperté por el sonido de mi celular envuelta en los brazos de Darío, quien se había acurrucado a mi lado. Era Josh. Me levanté con cuidado de despertarlo aunque sabía que cuando él dormia no había poder humano que lo despierte. Salí de la habitación y me di cuenta que la puerta de Peter estaba cerrada asi que me dirigí a la sala antes de contestar. - ¿Qué sucede? – había un montón de ruido al otro lado. Probablemente Josh se encontraba en una fiesta. – Ya no puedo más, Alex. Ya no… te necesito tanto… que duele. – Las palabras de Josh causaron dolor al mismo tiempo que me confirmaron lo ebrio que estaba. – ¿Porqué estuviste bebiendo? Empezó a reír de forma descontrolada. – Te llamo para hablarte de mis sentimientos, te desnudo y mi alma y lo único que te importa es que he estado bebiendo. ¿Cómo puedes ser tan cruel? – Josh. No es momento de hablar. Ya hemos pasado por esto otras veces, nunca logras nada cuando te emborrachas. – Si logro algo. Logro que te preocupes por mí y que me busques. – Parte de mí se enojaba por su seguridad. Él estaba malditamente manipulandome. – Será mejor que encuentres una manera de ir a tu casa. Ya hablaremos luego. – Estaba decidida a cortarlo de raíz. – Quiero verte ahora. Por favor, no… no me dejes. – Parecía que sollozaba y saber eso me estaba hundiendo en tristeza. – No puedo, Josh. Hablaremos en otro momento. – Espera – gritó – Si no hablas conmigo ahora te juro que ire en busca de Darío y le diré todo. Maldita sea, eso es lo que debería hacer, pero te estoy dando uns salida, la tomas o la dejas. – No podía creer que me estaba amenazando. Maldito idiota. – Voy en camino. Estoy entrando en mi auto. – No puedes conducir en ese estado. – ¿Ahora si te preocupas por mí? Estaré ahí en 20 minutos, si no estás en tu entrada, juro que diré todo. – Y el maldito cortó la llamada. Sabpía que cumpliría su amenaza y más en ese estado que no tenía inhibiciones y las palabras solo salian de él. Rapidamente busqué un abrigo y me puse un par de zapatos cómodos. Dejé una nota para Darío, mintiendole que tenía turno y que lo llamaré en cuanto este mejor. Salí del departamento sigilosamente. La noche era fría, solo esperaba que Josh se diera prisa y también rezaba porque no le pasara nada mientras conducía en ese estado. El chillido de los frenos de su camioneta debieron alertar a todo el barrios de su llegada. Me aproximé hacia él que había \"estacionado\" en media vía. Me dirigí al lado del conductor y abrí la puerta. Su cara estaba contra el volante y apenas pudo girar para mirarme. – No tengo idea de como pudiste conducir así. – Podía haberle pasado un millon de cosas. Gracias a Dios no fue así. – Es solo el destino que quiere que estemos juntos. Me protege. – Me costó no poner los ojos en blanco. Logré colocar a Josh en el asiento del acompañante y ajustar su cinturón de seguridad. Me puse tras el volante y me dirigí a su departamente. El guardia nocturno me ayudó a llevarlo a su piso y dejarlo en su cama. Josh se había quedado inconsciente en el camino. Nunca lo había visto de esta manera. Logré quitarle su ropa y colocarle un pantalón chandal y una camiseta, comodós para dormir. Logré conseguir una cubeta justo a tiempo antes de que derramara todo su contenido estomacal en el piso. Me costó mucho sostenerlo para que no cayera de la cama, al igual que asi no logró retener mi propio estómago. Nunca había tenido asco a nada pero últimamente mi estómago no recibía bien casi ningun alimento. Puse una toalla húmeda sobre su cabeza y busque su botiquín. Alguna vez dejé mi bolso de medicamentos aquí y le sugerí a Josh que los guardado. Gracias al cielo lo había hecho y encontré el querido complejo B. Tuvé que rodarlo para dejarlo boca abajo. Solo rogaba que no vomité sobre la cama. Había quedado nuevamente inconsciente. Inyecte la sustancia en su nalga y fui a buscar un poco de café. Me tomé un poco de tiempo porque Josh tenía brownies y últimamente mi fascinación por el chocolate había ido en aumento. Cuando regresé lo encontré mirando al techo con sus brazos extendidos en toda la cama. – ¿Te sientes mejor? – me miró por un momento luego sus ojos volvieron al techo. Seguía esperando por su respuesta, aunque sabía que todavía lso efectos del alcohol debía nublar su mente. Me acerqué lentamente y me senté en el borde de la cama. – ¿Te acostaste con él? Su pregunta me tomo desprevenida pero me dio las respuestas que necesiatab para saber como terminó de esa manera. Pensé en decirle que no era su asunto, pero ante mi silencio las lágrimas empezarón a caer por sus sienes. Soy ruin, pero él merece la verdad. Me acurruqué a su lado, descansando mi cabeza en su brazo. Él no trató de estrecharme ni tampoco me alejó. Besé su sien probando la sal de sus lágrimas. – No lo hice. No… no pude. Su brazo se enredó en mi cintura y su calidez me alivio. – ¿Porqué? – balbuceó. – Él no eres tú. – Sabía que esas palabras cambiaban todo pero él merecía la verdad. – ¿Me amas? – su voz era la de un niño. – Porque yo te amo demasiado y creí que si tomaba lo que me ofrecías sería suficiente pero… no lo es. Solo ver que tu lo quería cerca y a mí lejos me destrozó. Cada vez que lo elijes a él sobre mí… me destruye y ya no estoy seguro de cuanto aun quede de mí que no este roto. No pude evitar llorar. – No quiero que estés roto, yo quiero que seas feliz. Mereces ser feliz, pero yo no soy la personas adecuada para ti. Mira como mis estúpidas decisiones nos han destruido. Yo no te merezco. – Tú mereces el mundo... – No, yo.. soy lo peor que hay, soy ruin, cruel, mentirosa y estúpida. Tú mereces a alguien quién te ame con la misma intensidad que tú,alguien que sea bueno, alguien que esté contigo toda una vida y que no se esté…– muriendo. Me interrumpí. – ¿Qué? ¿Qué no se este qué? – No soy yo. Suspiró. – Si tan solo me dijeras lo que sientes por mí… por lo menos debo agradecer que estés aquí conmigo. – Tú mismo lo dijiste – sonreí – Siempre consigues mi atención. – Lo que yo quiero es tu corazón. – Ya lo tienes. – Debes conseguir a esa persona. Buscalá. – No quiero. – Por mí. No puedo – morir – vivir tranquila si tú no eres feliz. Se aferró a mí – No prometo nada. Esa noche me aferré a él con la misma fuerza que Josh. No quería dejarlo, quería tragarme cada palrabra y quedarme para siempre en sus brazos. Pero había una dura realidad, cada vez me quedaba menos tiempo y lo último que quería era hacerle, hacernos mas daño. Me fui en la madrugada. Alejarme de su lado fue lo mas díficil que he hecho. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Sabía que se había ido antes de abrir mis ojos. Aunque parte de mí quería ir tras ella decidí ir paso a paso, que pasara lo que tuviera que pasar, pero yo ya no pensaba hacer más. Ni para abandonar ni para intentar. La cabeza me palpitaba como si un martillo estuviera haciendo su labor en mi cerebro. Alcancé el agua y las píldoras que me había dejado y me las tomé. El día estaba nublado, iba acorde a como me sentía. Casi no recordaba nuestra conversación, de lo único que estaba seguro es que ella no se había acostado con su novio y que yo derramé mis sentimientos como un río, nuevamente. Me quedé todo el día en cama, no tenía hambre, solo tomaba agua. Para la noche llamé a mi mamá y le puse al tanto de todo. Me dijo que mantenga las esperanzas y que todo estaría bien pero sabía que la realidad no era como ella lo pintaba. Al siguiente día mientras desayunaba mi telefono sonó con una llamada de Claudia. – Clau ¿Cómo estás? – Hola, Josh. Estoy en Boston, tengo unos días libres de grabaciones y estoy viajando a mi casa. Mi vuelo sale a media tarde y quería saber si quieres almorzar conmigo antes de que me vaya. La idea no me agrada en realidad pero, ¡Qué diablos! No podía amargarme toda mi vida. – Vale. ¿Dónde nos vemos? Cuando llegué a nuestro punto de encuentro, Claudia ya estaba esperandome. Debo decir que se veía genial con su corta falda y esa blusa roja. Ella podía impresionar a cualquier chico. Hablamos durante horas sobre sus proyectos y por un momento olvidé todos los problemas. Claudia siempre fue y sigue siendo agradable cuando no hablamos de nuestra relación. Ya en la tarde la llevé al aeropuerto para que se embarcará camino a España. – Bien, fue un gusto verte. Llámame cuando regreses. – Quiero que hagas algo por mí. – Claro. Lo que quieras. Claudia se acercó a mi y me besó. Fue rápido y debo decir que placentero. Se que suena estúpido pero tener el conocimiento de que alguien estaría dispuesto a todo por ti de alguna manera te llena de confianza. – Piensa en mí, por favor. Se fue sin esperar respuesta. Quizás la vida me estaba cerrando puertas y abriendo una ventana con Claudia. No podía pensar de esa manera. Publiqué un mensaje en mis redes sociales, para ella: Nunca digas nunca mientras no lo sepamos..! /3 :/ (Never say never – The Fray: www_youtube_com/watch?v=4nsFRDQgrik&hd;=1 ) Aunque intente nunca dejaré de amar a Alex. Ahora solo esperaré que ella venga a mí. Ya le he dicho lo mucho que la quiero. Si mi mamá tiene razón lo que ella necesita es poder confiar en mí y sentirse segura de que lo único que haré es amarla y esperar que sea feliz. Se que es eso, ella me dijo que necesita qu cuide de ella cuanod me dio esos preservativos y yo fallé. No puedo seguir haciéndolo. De aquí en adelante no habra ninguna otra chica en mi vida, solo ella. Y eso será hasta que ella decida que hacer. Pero mi maldito plan se fue por el desagüe cuando prendí la televisión por la noche. Otra vez los malditos medios complicaban mi vida. Hablaban de mi relación con Claudia, de mi mensaje para ella y mostraron un video de nuestro beso en el aeropuerto. Para ahora Alex debió haberlo visto. Maldita sea mi suerte. Hooola :) estoy de viaje pero decidí darles este cap. Lamento por no poder actualizar muy seguido y en verdad espero q me tengan paciencia con estos capítulos porque en realidad me falta tiempo y son difíciles de escribir... espero sus reviews :) Nos leemos luego .-.-. MILET AVANCE: - No más de lo que ella nos lo hace a nosotros. – Sus palabras llenas de rencor fueron como una cacheteada. - ¿Por qué no puedes confiar en mí? Alex… ella me besó, me pidió que piense en ella, que le de una oportunidad a nuestra relación pero es imposible y no me canso de decirte lo mucho que te amo. - Vete, Josh. – Fer lo empujaba contra la puerta. Josh se dejaba llevar ante mi silencio. - Alex… por favor. – suplicó. Me quedé en silencio mientras Fer lo sacaba.[Chapter 103] Capítulo 103 Había regresado a mi departamento y compartía cama con mi novio, pero no habíamos hecho nada. No podía soportar que me tocará pero disimulaba bien frente a él. Mi estómago aún me obligaba a correr en las mañanas. - ¿Estás bien? – Fer se encontraba en la puerta del baño. Cuando terminé me pasó una toalla húmeda. Solo asentí mientras me recostaba contra la pared. - ¿Qué sucede? - Solo un virus… ya no estoy segura. Fer se sentó a mi lado en el piso del baño. – Lo siento… Se que no he sido la mejor amiga que debería ser. Sé que te he abandonado y he fallado de un millón de maneras distintas obviando cosas que han estado ahí por encerrarme solo en mi mundo. Quiero que vuelvas a confiar en mí, Alex. Siempre nos hemos contado todo sin juzgarnos, y se que algo te sucede y me siento tan mal por no ser esa amiga en quién puedas refugiarte. - No solo has sido tú… yo también me encerrado en mí misma. - Las cosas pueden cambiar. Puedes decirme lo que sucede, sé que necesitas sacarlo porque puedo ver la tormenta en tus ojos. Me abrazó y no sé que me hizo empezar a llorar. Ella me dejó hacerlo sin preguntar más. Necesitaba tanto tener a alguien a mi lado. Cuando pude calmarme nos acomodamos en mi cama frente al televisor mientras empezamos a hablar. Ella me contó sobre el millón de cosas que me he perdido sobre su vida, sobre sus sentimeintos por su esposo y su pequeña. Hasta que llegó mi turno. - ¿Que te encuentres de esa manera tiene que ver con Josh? – soltó. Podría decir que parte era mi enfermedad pero de cierta manera eso era soportable, la verdad es que la manera en que Josh se había marchado me había dejado completamente triste. Lo extrañaba malditamente demasiado. - Él no quiere saber de mí. Lo herí. - Sabes que puedes decirme lo que sea y no te juzgaré ¿verdad? – asentí y empecé con mis historia. Le conté todo lo que había sucedido con Josh, sin dejar por alto nada. Para cuando terminé ella se quedpo en silencio. – Guauuuu. Tenemos mucho que discutir pero ahora vamos por lo más importante. ¿Hay la posibilidad de que estés embarazada? EMBARAZO. La palabra resonó por toda mi cabeza mandando una oleada de miedo por todo mi cuerpo. Me estremecí. No podía estar sucediendo. No había manera. Bueno si había manera, había tenido sexo… mucho sexo con Josh y ahora tenía… tenía síntomas de embarazo, pero nos protegimos. Usamos protección. - Oh por Dios.- sollocé. – No… no puedo… - Será mejor que nos aseguremos. – dijo mi amiga. Tomé mi celular. Tenía una aplicación donde controlaba mi ciclo y efectivamente, tenía 2 meses de retraso. ¿Cómo pude no haberme dado cuenta? Pensé que quizás podía ser por la medicación que me adminsitraron por mi sangrado excesivo causó eso, pero… ¿Cómo ignoré el resto de síntomas? - Será mejor que nos aseguremos. Luego encontraremos la forma de… de solucionarlo. - Lo voy a tener. Es mi… bebé. – no podíadejar de temblar. Pronunciar cada palabra me costaba mucho. Todo era irreal, esto no me estaba pasando a mí. - No me refería a que vayas a abortar. Yo sé que no lo harías. Me refería a como lidiaras con Darío y con Josh. - Oh por Dios. Darío. – Él nunca me perdonará que lo haya traicionado de esa manera. Me odiará. - Shhh, vamos tranquila.- Me tomó un momento más dejar de llorar. Quería gritar. Si pensaba que mi vida no podía complicarse más ahí estaba mi respuesta. – Voy a llamar a una amiga para ver si puede reemplazarme, y luego iremos a hacerte un examen solo para estar seguras. Asentí. Me concentré e el televisor tratando de no caer con un ataque de pánico. Mi mundo volvió a detenerse cuando Josh apareció en la pantalla besando a Claudia. Ella se fue y él tenía una gran sonrisa en su rostro. El programa decía que las imágenes fueron tomadas ayer. Adjuntaron una cación que Josh había dedicado a su nueva novia. Nunca digas nunca mientras no lo sepamos..! /3 :/ (Never say never – The Fray: www_youtube_com/watch?v=4nsFRDQgrik&hd;=1) - Creo que todos deberíamos seguir el consejo de Josh: Nunca digas nunca. Nosotros que suponíamos que ellos nunca regresarían pero aquí tenemos la muestra de que no es así. El resto de comentarista dieron opiniones antes de cerrar su programa. Me quedé mirando la pantalla mientras las lágrimas volvían a derramarse por mis mejillas. Maldito. Él me había abandonado. Se que yo le pedí que hiciera exactamente eso, que busqué a alguien a quién amar y se olvidé de mí, pero él lo huzo cuando más lo necesitaba. No me había percatado que mi amiga había regresado pero su rostro expresaba lo mismo que yo. Rabia hacia Josh. - Deberías tomar un ducha, ya conseguí uan cita para ti. Asentí y me metí bajo el agua. Me costó toda mi fuerza poner mi mente en blanco para poder tranquilizarme. Me vestí como autómata, solo respiraba porque mi cuerpo lo exigía. El timbre sonó y un momento despues escuché a Fer gritar. - ¿Qué demonios haces aquí? Me estremecí cuando esuché la voz de Josh. – No tengo tiempo para discutir contigo. ¿Dónde está? - Lárgate, Josh. No tienes derecho de estar aquí luego… - Veo que estás al tanto de todo. – la voz de Josh se oía más cerca. - Eres un imbécil. No tienes nada que hacer aquí. Debería irte con tu novia, no creo que le haga alguna gracia saber que estás aquí. - No me importa una mierda. – Josh empujó mi puerta. se detuvo un momento cuando me vio. Me exámino de pies a cabeza y sabía muy bien que mi aspecto me delataba. Él sabía que estuve llorando. Y lo pero, sabía que había llorado por él. – No la besé. Me tomó 2 segundos entender sus palabras. – No me impor… - No me digas que no te importa. – sus manos agarraron mis brazos. – SI no te importará no estarías de esta manera porque se que te duele. Aunque no quieras admitir tus sentimientos sabes lo mucho que te odias la idea de alguien a mi lado, asi como yo odio saber que estás con otro. - Vete – gemí. Mi mirada estaba en el suelo. - Vete, Josh. Le haces daño. – dijo mi amiga. - No más de lo que ella nos lo hace a nosotros. – Sus palabras llenas de rencor fueron como una cacheteada. - ¿Por qué no puedes confiar en mí? Alex… ella me besó, me pidió que piense en ella, que le de una oportunidad a nuestra relación pero es imposible y no me canso de decirte lo mucho que te amo. - Vete, Josh. – Fer lo empujaba contra la puerta. Josh se dejaba llevar ante mi silencio. - Alex… por favor. – suplicó. Me quedé en silencio mientras Fer lo sacaba. Él tenía razón, yo había dañado lo que había entre nosotros. Yo nos había lastimado a ambos. Y ahora estoy tan perdida, tan… sola. Y lo necesito. A él. Fer regresó a mi lado. – Luego discutiremos lo que acba de pasar. Primero tenemos que… saber lo que tienes. Fer condujo todo el camino a mi cita médica. Cuando llegamos al hospital, ya conocido, no tuve que esperar para pasar a consulta. La doctora rapidamente me sacó una muestra de sangre y la envio al laboratorio mientras me hacía un millón de preguntas. Empezó a examinarme. - ¿Has tenido tos o alguna infección de vías aereas recientemente? - No. ¿Algo malo? - Me parece que tienes ciertos estertores. Pero puede que todo sea pasajero si no te has sentido mal. - No, nada de fiebre. Pero si me siento rara prometo tomar antibióticos. Dos golpes en la puerta. – Puedes vestirte, esos deben ser los resultados. - Me pidieron que te entregué estos resultados. Creo que debes felicitar a la futura ma… - La doctora Julianne se setuvo cuando me vio. Miró de mí a los resultados. Yo me quedé estupefacta al entender lo que ella decía. Iba a ser mamá. – Alexandra. Tú… ¿es de Josh? La doctora que me atendía se quedó en silencio tratando de entender la situación. Yo aún no me recuperba por la noticia de que pronto me convertiría en madre y que el padre de mi hijo era Josh no mi novio. La doctora Julianne se acercó a mí. - ¿Josh lo sabe, Alexandra. - Acabo de enterarme. Es de él pero… no se lo diga. - No puedes pedirme que me quede callada. No estas pensando en ocultarselo ¿verdad? - Se lo diré, pero… necesito tiempo. – en algun momento las lágrimas volvieron a caer en mi rostro. Pensé que luego de tanto llorar ya o debería tener lágrimas. – Por favor… Ambas doctoras me miraron. Tomé mi resultado y me apresuré a salir del consultorio. Un momento despues escuché la voz de Julianne llamándome. Me alcanzó en el ascensor. – No has contestado mis llamadas. Te dije que no podías quedarte embarazada estas poniendo en riesgo tu vida y la de ese bebé. Tienes Leucemia, Alexandra. ¿cómo pudiste ser tan irresponsable? - Lo sé…- lo sabía pero no quería que me reclamara. Sabía que cada maldita decisión que habái tomado me estaba matando ahora. - ¿Por lo menos has conseguido un médico? – negué con la cabeza. – Debemos empezar el tratamiento ahora. Debes quedarte, tal vez… podamos hacer algo. Ahora hay tratamientos que no ponene en riesgo la vida del feto. - Lo sé… prometo volver. Solo… necesito tiempo. necesito pensar. Necesito saber que hacer. - Eres una bomba de tiempo en estos momentos. – habíamos llegado al estacionamiento. - Por favor… mañana estaré aquí. Solo necesito un par de horas. – algo en mi voz hizo que no insistiera y me dejó ir. Me acomodé en el asiento de pasajero y le di mis resultados a Fernanda. Los leyó y luego me abrazó. Volvimos a nuestro apartamento en silencio. Hoy solo seríamos las dos. Darío estaba de viaje y Santiago de turno. Ya de noche me sirvió un té y se sentó a mi lado. - Lo amas ¿verdad? - ¿A quién? – pregunté mirando a la pared. - ¿A Josh? - No… no lo sé. - Pues yo si lo sé. Lo amas. Siempre lo has hecho es por eso que no puedes dejarlo ir porque aunque en tu mente sabes que debes mantenerte lejos, porque te hirió y debes refugiarte en Darío; tu corazón y tu alma te piden a Josh. Por algo vas a tener su bebé, por algo has alejado al mundo de ti para que nadie te pida que lo abandones, por algo sufres con su ausencia. - Pero Darío… - Alex. Darío fue tu primer amor y él lo jodió todo y aun así le diste una nueva oportunidad. ¿Sabes porque te cuesta tanto darle una nueva oportunidad a Josh? Porque sabes que si él te falla será tu final. Él tiene ese poder porque tú lo amas con desesperación. – Suspiró. – No te niego que me hubiera gustado que te quedes con Darío y lleguemos a ser familia. Pero tú no la amas y si no lo dejas ir nunca amará pasara de ti. No es amor si no eres correspondido, es solo ilusión, capricho. Ustedes se llevan bien pero tienen más una relación de amigos que necesitan sentirse queridos y seguros con alguien más. - No, no lo sé… - Lo sabes Alex, solo… no quiero aceptarlo. No quieres arriesgarte. Lo amas tanto que te asusta que él tenga ese poder sobre ti. Pensé por un momento en sus palabras y recordé cada momento vivido con Josh. Cada momento en que me perdía en su mirada y sus caricias. Cada momento en que sentía que mi vida tenía sentido y que estaba segura. Todos esos momentos solo éramos Josh y yo. Pero yo lo quería conmigo… aunque no lo mereciera. - Gracias… - Solo quiero que hagas lo correcto para ti. Todo se arreglará aunque parezca que no. Ahora dile a Josh que será padre, que lo amas con desesperación y que cada vez que lo miras mueres por arrancarle la ropa y que te haga gemir… No pude evitar reír. – Vale, hablaré con el primero, luego… tendré que decirle a Darío. - Algo me dice que aún no has decidido, pero cuando hables con Josh, míralo a los ojos y deja que tu alma y tu corazón digan lo que sientes. No lo reprimas. Le di un abrazo y marqué el número de Josh. Mis manos temblaban y sabía que quizás esta era mi última oportunidad. – Hola – susurró. - Hola. ¿Puedo… puedo hablar contigo? - Sabes que eso es lo que más quiero. Que hables conmigo. - Tengo… algo que decirte. – mi voz no dejaba de temblar. - ¿Es algo bueno o malo? - Aún no lo sé, pero… tengo que decírtelo. - Ohh. ¿Quieres que vaya por ti? - No. Podemos encontrarnos en… - pensé un momento el lugar - en la heladería a la que fuimos la última vez. ¿En una hora? Recuerdo que encontramos una heladería artesanal. Probamos todos los sabores y terminamos ambos con dolor de cabeza. – Sí. Nos vemos ahí. - Estaré ahí. – su era tonos suave. Ambos nos quedamos en silencio sin querer cortar la llamada. - ¿Josh? - ¿Sí? – dijo con cautela. Tomé una gran bocanada de aire antes de preguntar lo que más quería saber. - ¿Aún me amas? - Eso nunca lo dudes. Sonreí. – Entonces creo que lo que te gustará lo que te tengo que decir. Corté antes de que me pregunte mas y le diga todo. No pude evitar que una gran sonrisa se formara en mi rostros y que mi corazón latiera desbocado por la anticipación. - Suerte. – me dijo Fer mientras tomaba mi bolso. – No es necesario que vengas hoy noche. Necesitan \"reconciliación\". - Eres terrible. – le di un gran abrazo. – Gracias. - Para eso está una mejor amiga. Me apresuré a tomar un taxi. El tráfico era insostenible por lo que me bajé a un lado de la calle. Si atravesaba a pie el parque frente a la heladería llegaría mas rápido que en auto. Pensaba en como decirle a Josh que sería padre. Muchas veces él había dicho que quería un niño, pero es muy diferente decirlo y vivirlo en realidad y mucho más en nuestras circunstancias. Y está de por medio nuestra relación y todos los problemas que nos rodean. No se si él pueda perdonarme, no se si yo pueda perdonarme por lo que he provocado. Y de repente lo vi... Estaba al otro lado de la calle, dentro de la heladería junto a la ventana, con un lirio en sus manos. Parecía encerrado en su propio mundo, ajeno a lo que pasaba a su alrededor. Mi mente gritando su nombre, deseando que levantara la vista y me mirara, entonces lo hizo, pude ver sus ojos y en ese momento supe que estaba jodida. Jodida, loca y estúpidamente enamorada de él. Había querido negar la magnitud de mis sentimientos por él pero llegó la hora de dejar de mentir a todos y a mí mismo sobre lo que sentía. Mis miedos e inseguridades me han evitado ser feliz desde un inicio. Josh tenía razón cuando dijo que yo sabía que él no me había engañado, tenía mucha razón cuando dijo que era la única que nos apartaba. Lo que sentía por Darío nunca se compararía con lo que sentía por Josh. Era el momento de tomar la decisión. Sé que dolerá, sé que le haré daño pero lo haré mucho más si no lo dejo libre y lo sigo engañando nos haré daño a ambos, porque nunca lo llegaré a amar como se lo merece y el nunca tendrá la oportunidad de ser amado de esa manera. Caminaré hasta a Josh, lo besaré y tal vez terminemos haciendo el amor. Le diré la manera en que me siento. Pediré perdón por haber sido tan estúpida y necia y por habernos negado la felicidad. Lucharé por enmendar mis errores y por hacerlo feliz. Nos amaremos y enfrentaremos cada problema juntos. Tenemos muchas vidas en nuestras manos, no solo la de nuestro hijo, si no también la mía. Me había estado echando a morir pero ahora tengo algo porque vivir. Y de alguna manera siento en mi corazón que podemos lograrlo. Empecé a avanzar en su dirección y sentí como el corazón se me aceleraba. No entendí por qué pero mi respiración era lenta y entrecortada. De un momento a otro todo se tiño de negro y un dolor en mi costado como puñalada que me cortó la respiración fue lo último que sentí. -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-. Hoooola :) Se q me extrañaron :P tendrán que tenerme mucha paciencia para los próximos capítulos ahora que ya estoy en clases.. ¿Q opinan del capítulo? y lo más importante ¿Q creen q sucederá? se q quizas quieran matarme x poner las cosas de esta manera y quizás con el próximo capítulo me maldigan pero no crean q soy tan mala :) Espero ansiosa sus comentarios. les agradezco por el tiempo q se toman para leer la historia y para comentar :) Nos leemos luego :) .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- z3 MILET AVANCE: ¿Bebé? Mi alma cayó al piso. Si antes estaba perdido ahora me sentía en un laberinto sin salida. Fer hablaba de un bebé. De un embarazo y yo sabía que si ese bebé existía era… era mío. Mis manos fueron a mi rostro. Oh por Dios.[Chapter 104] Capítulo 104 - ¿Aún me amas? - ¿Cómo podía dudarlo, aún? La calidez y timidez de su voz me decía que no dudaba, solo que necesitaba oírlo. - Eso nunca lo dudes. – Entonces creo que lo que te gustará lo que te tengo que decir. – Iba a preguntar pero ella cortó la llamada. Por alguna razón algo en mi corazón me decía que tal vez llegó el momento en el que todo iría bien. Me apresuré a conseguir una de sus flores favoritas. Mi corazón brincaba de entusiasmo mientras los minutos corrían, pero había una sensación helada, como un mal presentimiento que me rondaba. Me senté a esperarla en una mesa junto a la ventana. No pude evitar sonreír al recordar cada gesto, cada risa, cada caricia. Ambos somos cobardes, ambos amamos escapar del mundo al nuestro en lugar de enfrentarnos a nuestros propios demonios. Al inicio pensé que solo era ella la que evadía sus problemas pero me doy cuenta que yo le dejaba porque temía que al hacerlo ella finalmente la balanza no se incline a mi favor. Recordar la forma en que la conocí,hasta ahora no me hago la idea de como pude ser tan idiota y haber sido un grosero con ella. Ese choqué con ella le provocó una contusión en su cabez, al mismo tiempo que golpeó mi corazón para que solo pueda latir a su ritmo. Aun recuerdo nuestro primer beso mientras jugabamos twister. ¿Cómo olvidar cuando había admitido que había deseado que nuestros labios se encuentren? Son pequeños momentos que siempre atesoraré. Observó mi reloj y veo que llega tarde. Espero que no me deje plantado porque eso sería destrozar completamente con el punta pie final. Pero se qué no haría, lo escuché en su voz, en la esperanza que envolvía su pregunta sobre si aún la amaba. Ella llegará. La gente a mi alrededor empezó a asomarse a la ventana murmurando. Me fijé en lo que veían y noté una ambulancia estacionada, paramédicos apartando a los transeúntes. Esa sensación helada de posó en mi corazón haciendome entender que algo iba relamente mal, haciendome entrar en desesperación. Salí de la heladería corriendo hacia donde estaba la multitud. Me abrí paso de alguna manera y me encontré con la imagen más espantosa. Ella. La dueña de mi corazón sobre la camilla, con los paramédicos a su lado ajustando correas, examinándola. Mi mirada fue al suelo donde se había estado y pude ver una pequeña mancha de sangre. Volví mi miarada a ella, sus labios estaba morados con un ligero rastro de sangre, debía costarle respirar au inconsciente porque rápidamente le colocaron una mascarilla de oxígeno. La alejaban de mí y eso me hizo reaccionar. Grité su nombre y corrí hacia ella. – ¿Eres un familiar? – me preguntó un paramédico. – Ella… es, ella es mi mujer. – Quizás no tenía derecho de llamarla así pero mi corazón y mi alma fueron los que respondieron. – Entonces suba. – me ayudaron acomodarme a un lado y colocarme un cinturón mientras la ambulancia arrancaba y los médicos le atendían. Uno de ellos estaba comunicándo el estado de Alex al hospital donde nos dirigíamos avisándo su estado. Traté de entender lo que decía. – Paciente femenino en síncope con disnea, cianosis, taquipnea, taquicardia, aparente hemoptisis y su temperatura de 38.5°C. Presenta estertores crepitantes diseminados por ambos campos pulmonares, presión de oxígeno de 50 mmHg, Presión CO2 de 35mmHg. Diagnóstico presuntivo Tromboembolia Pulmonar. Estamos administrando oxígeno y canalizando vía venosa periférica. Solicitamos ingreso en cuidados intensivos, TAC y preparación para cirugía menor de adminsitración de cateter central de confirmarse diagnóstico. Maldita sea. No entendía casi nada de lo que hablaban y la ignorancia me sumía mas en la deseperación. Tenía su mano entre las mías y estaba completamente helada. No sabía que tenía ¿qué le estaba sucediendo? Y ella no depertaba, sus labios eran morados a pesar del oxígeno. Llegar a emergencias se sintió como una eternidad lo que en realidad debió ser menos de 5 minutos. Rapidamente la ingresaron por emergencias donde varios médicos empezaron actuar. No dejé ir su mano mientras pude estar a su lado. Me obligaron a dejarla. Mientras desaparecía de mi vista ella se llevaba parte de mí. Me senté en el suelo y apoye mi cabeza contra la pared. No entendía nada, no podía hacer nada mas que esperar mientras el miedo y la impotencia me seguía invadiendo. Pasaron horas y no obtuve noticias. Me vi obligado a llamar a mi tía Julianne, que no estaba de turno, para decirle lo que había pasado. Me dijo que estaba en camino. Cuando llegó, inmediatamente atravesó la puerta que me separaba de mi niña y reapareció horas despues cuando me sentía al borde de un colapso nervioso. - ¿Cómo está? ¿Qué tiene? ¿Porqué nadie me dice que diablos sucede? – mi desesperación no me dejaba pensar. - Cálmate, Josh. Necesito que estés tranquilo para lo que te tengo que decir. – Su tono de voz era triste y desolado. Estaba temiendo lo peor. - Dime lo que sucede. – Supliqué. - Vamos a mi consultorio. – Empezamos a caminar en esa dirección cuando un rostro conocido y preocupado estaba en información. Me reconoció y empezó a camianr en mi dirección. - ¿Qué sucedió, Josh? ¿Qué le pasa? – Fer estaba desesperada. – Dime, maldita sea. - ¿Cómo… cómo te enteraste? - Trabaja aquí. Alguno de sus compañeros me llamó. Dime que diablos tiene. – Nunca había visto a Fer de esa manera. Estaba al borde de las lágrimas. - Vamos a mi consultorio y les diré… - Mi tía Julianne trato de encaminarnos pero Fer se dirigió a ella. - ¿Esta bien? ¿Ella…- por un momento Fer me miró y titubeó en su pregunta – el bebé? ¿Bebé? Mi alma cayó al piso. Si antes estaba perdido ahora me sentía en un laberinto sin salida. Fer hablaba de un bebé. De un embarazo y yo sabía que si ese bebé existía era… era mío. Mis manos fueron a mi rostro. Oh por Dios. – Veo que no te lo dijo, aún. – dijo mi Tía Julianne dándome a entender que ella tambien lo sabía. – Ella te lo iba a decir hoy. – Fer intervinó. – ¿Es que todo mundo sabe que voy a ser padre menos yo? – grité frustrado. Algunas personas se detuvieron a mirarme. Mi tía nos arrastró a su consultorio. – Ella… Josh, ella te iba a decir. Te lo juro, nunca quisó ocultartelo y… y no se que sucedió. ¿Qué tiene? – su mirada cayó en mi tía quien se había sentado en su sillón detrás de su escritorio. – Esto es difícil. – Traté de tomar una gran respiración porque algo en mi corazón me decía que no eran buenas noticias. – Se confirmó el diagnóstico de TEP** – ¿TEP? ¿Cómo diablos puede tener eso ella? – gimió Fer. Yo no sabía de que hablaban, solo entendía que era grave. – Alexandra tiene… leucemia. – Y con una sola palabras mi mundo cayó en pedazos. No pudé moverme. Me había quedado completamente en shock otra vez en un día. – No entendio que sucedía pero ella… lo sospechamos y nunca vino por sus exámenes. Pensé que tal vez estaba trantándose ya con un especialista por lo que no insisití. Debí hacerlo, ella... no estaba bien. Algo en ella se estaba dando por vencida. – ¿Desde cuándo lo sabe? – preguntó Fer. – Un poco más de 3 meses. La internaron porque sufrió de metrorragia y le extragimos médula ósea. – Su rostro estaba lleno de frustración. – Creo… creo que se estaba dejando morir. Sus palabras apretaron mas mi pecho. – No lo sabía. – Nadie más lo sabía. Hoy me prometió que volvería, me pidió un poco de tiempo porque todavía no asimilaba que estaba embarazada. Dijo que iba a volver. – ¿Cómo está? – no entendía como Fer a pesar de sus lágrimas podía hacer la preguntas que yo no quería. – Su leucemia entro en fase proliferativa y su desequilibrio causo CID** lo que le llevó a desarrollar la tromboembolia. Estamos haciendo todo lo posible para sacarla de esto. Está estable pero en cuidados intensivos. El neurólogo sugirió mantenerla sedada para evitar su desgaste. El oncólogo está estudiando su caso para ver que tratamiento iniciar. Pero su condición es delicada, y hasta que no estemos seguros que hay avances no podemos dar un pronóstico. - ¿Y… y el bebé? – mi voz había regresado. Ante mi pregunta, su mirada cayo al piso. Sus ojos se llenaron de lágrimas. – Le dije que no podía quedarse embarazada. Lo siento tanto, Josh… - se acercó a mí y me abrazó. – No… no pudo ser. Su cuerpo no resistió y perdió su bebé. Lágrimas empezarón a rodar por mi rostro. Los sollozos de Fer llenaban el silencio que me rodeaba. La razón de mi existir estaba debatiéndose entre la vida y la muerte y una parte de ella se estaba dejando morir. Había perdido a mi hijo. Había perdido a mi hijo y yo era el único culpable de ese gran dolor. Ella me lo había dicho y yo había jugado a ser Dios y traicionarle. Nos he causado a ambos un dolor irremediable. Si ella sobrevive… ¿Me perdonará? ¿Me podré perdonar yo mismo al haber causado tal daño? Abrí la puerta para largarme, pero la voz de mi amiga me detuvo. – Ella… quería a su bebé. Te iba a decir que iban a ser padres y que… que te amaba. Iba a disculparse por todo y hacer lo correcto. Salí del consultorio y volví a mi lugar junto a cuidados intensivos. No me movería de aquí hasta que ella este bien y pueda decirle lo mucho que lo siento. Si ella no me perdonaba esta vez aceptaría su desición. Simplemente ella me odiaría como yo me odiaba en estos momentos pero necesitaba decirle cuanto me arrepiento de todo. Había arruinado nuestras vidas y lastimado a quién mas quería en el mundo. Mi cuerpo dolía luego de horas en esa misma posición. Los médicos entraban y salían sin darme respuestas. Tampoco evitaban que siga en ese lugar, tal vez mi estado les daba pena. No entedía como podía suceder esto cuando todo iba a mejorar. ¿En verdad ella iba a decirme que me amaba? ¿En verdad había estado a punto de ser padre? Había tantas cosas que asumir y sentía que no tenía la madurez para manejarlo todo. Me atormentaba la idea de que ella se estaba dejando morir ¿Porqué? No entendía como una persona tan vital, tan alegre, tan vibrante podía querer morir. No quería pensar que su cobardía la llevo a esto en lugar de enfrentar nuestra situación. Parte de mí estaba furioso con ella por ello, pero no era yo quién debería juzgarla, al fin y al cabo yo había jugado con su vida al dejarle embarazada. - Deberías descansar. – La voz de Santiago me sorprendió. - No puedo irme de aquí. Por lo menos hasta que ella este bien. – No le haces ningun bien a nadie si tú tambien enfermas. Por lo menos busca un lugar más cómodo. – Me ofreció un café que acepté gustosamente. Logré ponerme de pie y me encaminé a una pequeña sala de espera donde Fer se había acurricado en su sillon a dormir. – Lamento que este sucediendo todo esto. – Podía ver la preocupación de Santy en sus ojos. – Me contó todo… lo siento por su bebé. – ¿No estás molesto porque ambos engañamos a tu hermano? Una sonrisa sarcástica apareció en su rostro. – No soy la persona mas indicada para juzgar eso. Yo tambien dejé embarazada a una chica que no era mi novia ¿recuerdas?. A mi hermano le dolerá mucho pero si algo he aprendido con lo que vivimos Fer y yo, es que cuando hay sentimeintos tan fuertes, aunque nuestras mentes se nieguen, nuestros corazones ciegan a nuestro cerebro y caemos directamente en los brazos de las personas que en verdad necesitamos. – No sabes cuanto daría por retroceder el tiempo. Cambiaría muchas cosas. Evitaría todo lo que nos separó. En algun momento sucumbí al cansancio. Lo primero que vi cuando abrí mis ojos fue a mi madre. No pude ni preguntarle lo que hacía en este lugar porque me encerró en un abrazo. Al parecer mi tía le había informado la situación de Alex y tomó el primer vuelo para hacerme compañía. Le conté todo, incluyendo lo de mi bebé y lo culpable que era de concebirlo. – En ese momento lo vi como la única salida. ¿Y si no me perdona, mamá? ¿Cómo voy a seguir viviendo si ella me llega a odiar? Yo mismo me odio en estos momentos. No dijo nada, quería encontrar las palabras correctas pero no había nada que me podía hacer sentir bien en estos momentos. Tía Julianne me llevó a su consultorio para presentarme al médico oncólogo que trataba a mi niña me explicara la situación. – Quiero entender todo. – pedí al Dr. Cooper. – Primero que todo debe quedarte claro que hay varios tipos de leucemia. Alexandra tiene Leucemia Mieloide Crónica. Esto quiere decir que está atacando solo a las células mieloides que son: neutrófilos, monocitos, basófilos, eosínofilos, que son células de defensa; plaquetas, eritrocitos. Y su desarrollo se ha dado durante meses que a diferencia de la leucemia aguda que una vez que se desata lo hace con síntomas y compromete inmediatamente la vida. Ella ha entrado en remisión, es decir, que su enfermedad de la niñez ha regresado. Ya de por sí es un caso raro de leucemia en niños, este tipo de enfermedad es más común en adultos. No es algo raro que la leucemia remita luego de su tratamiento y aparente cura. Me costaba un poco seguir lo que me decía, sabía que lo estaba explicando de la forma mas entendible. – El cáncer son células que acumulan daños y por alguna razón mutan, volviendose inmortales que se reproducen rapidamente pero no cumplen la función que debería, por lo tanto utilizan espacio y nutrientes. Los síntomas que se desarrollan dependen de cada fase y de cada célula afectada. En la leucemia mieloide crónica tenemos 3 fases: Crónica, acelerada y blástica. - La fase crónica donde la enfermedad se instaura progresando muy despacio. Se puedepermanecer estable durante mucho tiempo. Los síntomas de esta fase de la enfermedad dependen de las células que por lo general son resultado de la disminución de su número. Puedes tener anemia y fatiga por los niveles bajos de eritrocitos, pequeños sangrados por disminución de plaquetas, o ser suceptible a infecciones por disminución de leucocitos. Pueden sufrir fiebre, pérdida de peso, también. Cada síntoma me recordaba a Alex. Sufrió varios desmayos por anemia, había perdido peso y le había dado neumonía por un simple contacto. – En la fase acelerada aparecen más síntomas o bien se agravan los anteriores, pudiendo dar lugar a grandes sangrados, infecciones, etc. La fase blástica, lás células cancerosas pueden ocupar gran parte de la médula ósea. Los glóbulos blancos inmaduros no maduran, y por tanto no pasan a ser glóbulos blancos funcionales, al igual que el resto de células que empiezan a provocar un desequilibrio total del cuerpo. Esta fase es más parecida a una leucemia aguda, por lo que es una urgencia médica. – ¿En qué fase está? – Entró en fase blástica y está teniendo una complicación llamada CID o coagulación intravascular diseminada. – El doctor tuvo que ver mi incrdulidad porque prosiguió con su explicación. – ¿Recuerdas que las plaquetas forman trombos para evitar hemorragias? Eso fuera de los vasos sanguíneos, pero normalmente este mecanismo no se activa dentro de los vasos, solo cuando hay laceraciones. El desorden celular ha activado ese mecanismo y las plaquetas han formado trombos por todo su organismo y estos quedan atrapados en vasos pequeños lo que provocan que no llegue sangre a estos y mueran. Varios trombos se juntaron e infartaron a sus pulmones por lo que ella ingresó con TEP. De alguna manera todo lo que me explicaba me llevaba a la misma conclusión: mi niña puede morir. – Esos trombos cerraron los vasos de la nueva placenta. Por eso perdieron a su bebé. Si hubiera estado en una fase previa hubieramos comenzado inmediatamente con el tratamiento y evitado esto. Con los tratamientos de la actualidad se han logrado culminar con embarazos en estas situaciones y visto nacer niños perfectamente sanos. – La mención de mi bebé me apretaba el corazón haciendomé sentir culpable. Parte de mi propio odio quería escapar echándole la culpa a Alex por echarse a morir y permitir que su enfermedad llegará a este punto. Pero no era correcto, ella… ella no quería un bebé. – ¿Puedo verla? ¿Por qué no despierta? ¿Por qué la sedan? – Este momento la tenemos aíslada. Estoy estudiando su caso y estoy listo para empezar con la quimioterapia pero primero necesito sacarle del CID. Está con anticogulantes muy fuertes por lo que debemos controlar que no haya sangrados. Debemos evitar que los trombos dañen su corazón y cerebro porque dejarí daños irrevocables si nole causa la muerte. – La mención de perderla enviaba escalofrío en mi columna. A pesar de lo que estaba viviendo no podía ni siquiera imaginar la posibilidad de que me la quiten de esta manera. – Estamos haciendo todo lo posible, Josh. – Mi tía apretó mi hombro. – Quiero verla. – Su estado es crítico, pero haré que la veas. – Dijo el doctor. Iba a agradecerles por su paciencia cuando un interno entró apresurada por la puerta. Un mal presentimiento se instauró en mi pecho. – Doctor… la paciente está convulsionando. Hooola :) antes de que me manen esperen al próximo capítulo :D Como pueden ver meto mucho historia en un capítulo ya no me tomo muchos... Ahora les pido paciencia, ahora no tengo verdaderamente naaaada de tiempos, pero no piensen q dejaré de actualizar. La verdad no estoy muy conforme de como están quedando lo capítulos pero no quiero hacerles esperar x lo q estoy subiendolos apenas terminó de escribirlos.. les invitó a seguirme en mi cuenta de wattpad: www_wattpad_com/user/Milet7393 La historia ahí va retrasada, pero es donde publicaré mis siguientes historias. claro esta vez mas cortas.. aunque estoy pensando en adaptar mis nuevas historias a una version de Josh y punlicarlas aquí.. aun no lo decido pero pronto les estaré informando al respecto.. Gracias x sus comentarios, no saben q tanto me emociono en leerlos... gracias por seguirme hasta este lugar.. a mi parecer la historia ya debió volverse aburrida luego de tantos capítulo pero sigo teniendo de mismo apoyo de su parte :D Nos leemos pronto .-.-.-.-.-.-.-z3 MILET AVANCE: – ¿Y si no lo hace? ¿Si su cuerpo no puede respirar por sí solo? – mi voz se estranguló mientras hablaba. – Si su cuerpo no puede cumplir una función básica tendremos que hacer más estudios más extensivos. La tomografía que le practicamos hace unos días no muestra zonas extensas de infarto en la masa cererbral pero podría haber en la zonas que controla sus funciones vitales primordiales. De ser el caso inmediatamente volveríamos a intubarla y… ustedes tendrán que decidir que haremos en el futuro. – ¿Habla de… de desconectarla?[Chapter 105] Capítulo 105 La estoy viendo mirando a traves del cristal. Está pálida, está delgada y esta dormida. Agujas por todo su cuerpo; un gran tubo entra en su boca y se que gracias a él aun respira. Se que está viva, el pitido de una de las máquinas me avisa que su corazón, aunque débil, sigue su marcha. Si tan solo abriera sus ojos. Extraño el brillo en ellos. Necesito saber que sigue ahí, que no se ha ido aún. Todavía me persigue el miedo que me provocaron las palabras de médico. Ella entró en crisis. Convulsionó. Probablemente partes de su cerebro resultaron afectadas, era lo que mas temían. Casi una semana después de eso aún sigue dormida, en un coma inducido por medicamentos. Temen que vuelva a empezar en un status epiléptico pero más temen que cuando deba abrir los ojos no lo haga porque pueda tener muerte cerebral. Pero los estudios de hoy dijeron que hay signos de función cerebral y como el protocolo médico exige, empezaron a quitar la medicación. Mi tía logró filtrarme aquí para verla. Parte de mí está aliviado de comprobar que aun esta viva, pero la otra parte daría lo que fuera por estar en su lugar. - La Doctora Julianne quiere verlo. – No quería irme tan pronto, aunque aparentemente he estado parado aquí por mas de 2 horas, pero no quería tentar mi suerte , además, si mi tía me estaba buscando debía ser para algo importante. Luego de dejar la ropa que me pidieron use para entrar en cuidados intensivos me dirigí a su consultorio. Toqué la puerta y la voz de mi tía me invitó a pasar. Me detuvé sorprendido ante los rostros conocidos que me esperaban, pero él que más me desconcertó fue el de Darío. Su mirada estaba llena de preocupación, de dolor y rabia. Llegó la hora de enfrentarlo. El otro rostro pertenecía a la mamá de mi chica. No había pensado en volver a verle. Sus ojos estaban llenos de lágrimas y podía ver la preocupación endureciendo todo su rostro que alguna vez me recibió con una gran sonrisa. - Les pusé al tanto de todo. – Podía ententeder la rabia, él sabía que el bebé no era suyo. Empezó a dirigirse a la puerta. Tendría que habar con él, despues de todo me metí en su relación, lo mínimo que merece es una respuesta. Traté de ponerme en su camino. – Darío… – No te atrevas a decirme nada, Josh. Eres la última persona a quien quiero ver. – Su mano sujetaba mi camisa. – Te pedí que te alejaras. Me dijiste que no interferirías. Mereces que saque toda la mierda de ti. Mereces que destrocé tu bonita cara… – No es momento de peleas – la mamá de Alex tomó del brazo a Darío. Le dio una mirada suplicante logrando que me suelte. Cerró de un portazóla puerta a mi lado. – Gracias. – murmuré mirando al piso. No era lo que esperaba pero ella envolvió sus brazos en mi cintura y empezó a sollozar. Me sentí tan aliviado de que no me odiara. Había engañado a su hija, había dañado la relación de ella y le había dejado embarazada a propósito, aunque ella no supiera de ello. – Lo lamento. – dijo secandosé los ojos. – Todos nos sentimos perdidos por lo que está pasando. Debes perdonar a Darío por reaccionar así, pero no es fácil perder a una persona de esa manera, mejor dicho, enterarte que perdiste sin darte cuenta. – No es él único que se siente mal. – Lo sé. Yo tengo miedo de mi hija pero tú… ustedes perdieron a su hijo… lo siento. Conozco el dolor de perder un hijo y… no quiero repetirlo. – Debemos confiar en Dios. Él hará que salga de esto. – Mi tía trataba de consolarla. Los horas transcurrieron sin ningún progreso. Se convirtieron en días y casi en una semana solo esperando que despertara. Mi madre y la de Alex se volvieron buenas amigas. Era bueno para ella tener a alguien quien le distraiga de caer en la desesperación. No sabía que mi madre hablara español. Fer tenía a Santiago para no dejarla derrumbar ante la preocupación, ambos pasaban todo el tiempo que disponían libre en el hospital. Peter tambien venía cada vez que podía. Ninguno tenía vida. Darío… bueno, él pasaba todo el día aquí, esperando al igual que yo alguna noticia. Nunca se acercaba y evitaba encontrarse conmigo a como de lugar. Ya nos permitían entrar a verla en el horario de visitas, por lo menos a traves del cristal de su habitación. Por mí la observara todo el día, pero a duras penas cuento con minutos, ya que su mamá, sus amigos y Darío ocupan todo el tiempo. Él suele demorarse, creo que intenta que yo no lo vea. Por suerte las enfermeras me compadecen y me permiten escabullir fuera de horario. Decidí ir por un café y le ofrecí uno a mi exsuegra. – Gracias. – ¿Alguna noticia nueva? – Me tomé tiempo para ir a mi apartamento y bañarme. – Ninguna.– Dijo angustiada. – No se preocupe, dicen que las malas noticias son las primeras en llegar. – Eso me temo. – Dijo tensandosé mientras veía mas alla de mí. Seguí su mirada y encontré al oncólogo viniendo a nosotros. – Necesito consultar unas cosas con usted. ¿Podemos ir a mi consultorio? – Claro. – Decidí quedarme en mi asiento aunque moría por ir con ella y saber de que se trata esto, pero no había sido invitado. – ¿Vamos, Josh? – Su invitación me sorprendió.– Cualquier cosa que me digan tienes que saberlo tambien, tienes todo el derecho de opinar sobre mi hija. Tomé su mano y fuimos hacia el consultorio. Nos acomodamos frente al escritorio y luego el doctor empezó su explicación. – Alexandra no responde. Aunque las pruebas que hemos realizado nos da altas expectativas no podemos seguir de esta manera. Lo que les voy a decir será duro, pero necesito su autprixación. – la mirada seria del médico enviaba oleadas de miedo a mi cuerpo. – Necesitamos retirar la intubación, necesitamos que su cuerpo respire por su cuenta… – ¿Y si no lo hace? ¿Si su cuerpo no puede respirar por sí solo? – mi voz se estranguló mientras hablaba. – Si su cuerpo no puede cumplir una función básica tendremos que hacer más estudios más extensivos. La tomografía que le practicamos hace unos días no muestra zonas extensas de infarto en la masa cererbral pero podría haber en la zonas que controla sus funciones vitales primordiales. De ser el caso inmediatamente volveríamos a intubarla y… ustedes tendrán que decidir que haremos en el futuro. – ¿Habla de… de desconectarla? – mi mundo se seguí desmoronando. No podía perderla, no podía morirse y esa decisión no podía estar en nuestras manos. – Es mejor no adelantarnos a los hechos. Necesito que firme la autorización para el procedimiento. – No… no puedo… no… – Empezó a llorar. Mis ojos tambien se llenaban de lágrimas y de miedo. Ambos nos abrazamos mientras él médico nos dejaba solos. – No le puedo hacer eso a mi hija. No puedo jugar con su vida. Trate de ser razonable y pensar en lo que el médico nos dijo.– Él dijo que sería lo mejor. Así podremos saber que va a pasar. Yo tampoco quiero que le pase nada.. si ella… si ella se va yo me voy con ella, pero verla de esa manera me mata, nos está matando a todos. Meditó mis palabras. Yo solo esperaba estar haciendo lo correcto, pero cada palabra que dije era la pura verdad. El doctor volvió . – ¿Está seguro de que es todo lo que puedo hacer? – Es lo único que podemos hacer. Tendremos respuestas y expectativas sobre lo que pasará. Es mucho mejor que la incertidumbre. – Lo que decía el médico era cierto. La incertidumbre puede destruirte lentamente. – Entonces firmaré. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Aunque lo he dicho otras veces, nunca en mi vida he sentido tanto miedo como ahora. Podría pensar que está dormido pero la cantidad de tubos y cables que salen de ella no me permite hacerme la idea. Esta mañana el padre de Alex llegó. Había tenido que solucionar unos asuntos de su trabajo antes de viajar. Su hermano no pudo viajar debido a que su esposa está cerca de dar a luz. Cuando mi suegro se enteró de todo lo sucedido, por un momento pensé que me golpearia. Ante sus ojos yo era la persona que había hecho daño a su niña en el pasado y ahora lo seguía haciendo. Había interferido en la relación estable de su hija, la había embarazado además de que, a su parecer, nada bueno podía venir de mi. A momentos pensaba que eso era cierto. Su esposa intervino y evitó el conflicto. También convenció de que yo debía estar presente este momento. Darío tuvo un problema con ello. Estamos en su habitación. No había podido estar así de cerca de ella. Todo era irreal. - Estamos listos - anunció el médico. Un equipo de médicos y enfermeras se colocaron alrededor de la cama. El ambiente era tenso, como si preparan para un guerra. El médico empezó a retirar las estructuras que sostenían dicho tubo dejándolo libre para extraerlo. Con un asentimiento hacia la enfermera ella detuvó el respirador artificial y él empezó a retirar dicho tubo. La sala se lleno de silencio. Mi mirada estaba en su pecho. Su pecho quieto. No se movía Respira, por favor. Tienes que respirar, vida mía. Todos conteníamos el aliento, pero sabía que el personal médico estaba listo para volver a unirla al respirador artificial. Respira, Alex. Tienes que hacerlo pequeña, tienes que vivir, tienes que… No podía dejar de temblar. Sabía que han pasado segundo pero se sentía toda una eternidad. Ahogué un sollozó. El aire se quedó atrapado en mis pulmones sin poder escapar. - Respira – afirmó el médico al mismo tiempo que vi su pecho inflarse. Una y otra vez, su pecho subía y bajaba. Alguien lloraba, estaba rodeado de sonidos pero no podía apartar mi mirada de ella. Era su madre, quien llena de lágrmias se abrió paso y le abrazó. Aun no despertaba pero respiraba y eso era más que suficiente por ahora. - Todo esta bien. – la mano del padre de Alex estaba en mi hombro y en sus ojos no había enojo. Mis manos fueran a mi rostro y noté la humedad por mis mejillas. Por un momento creí que me desmayaría. La vida había vuelto a mí, cada respiro de ella nos traía vida a ambos. Salí de la habitación. Ya afuera le dije las buenas nuevas a Fernanda y los demás. A pesar del enojo de Darío en verdad lo vi sonreír en mucho tiempo. – Esa es mi chica – Dijo. Por un momento quería golpearlo. No era su chica. Pero tuve que reprimir, era normal que se exprese de esa manera, a pesar de todo, aún era su novia. Ya por la noche, el oncólogo nos hablo de su estado. Despertaría, que pudiera respirar por sí mismo solo nos descarataba completamente un daño cerebral letal, ahora todo dependía de ella. Aún permanecería en cuidados intensivos, pero él médico aseguraba que solo sería cuestión de tiempo para que ella abra sus ojos. Lo preocupante era la respuesta de su enfermedad a los tratamientos. Nos explicó que la quimioterapia administrada nos dio los resultados esperados e iniciarían con fármacos mas fuertes. Era un valde de agua fría para todos. Esa noche convencí a los padres de Alex que descansarán. Les juré que los llamaría si pasaba algo. De todos modos nadie tenía permitido estar cerca de ella por ahora. A regañientes todos fueron a descansar, por lo menos hoy habíamos tenido una victoria y podría de alguna forma dormir mas tranquilos. Tía Julianne y sus amigas me filtraron en el área de cuidados intensivos ya avanzada la noche. Me quedé en el umbral de la puerta para observarla. Además de una intravenosa, el oxígeno que le administraban por puntas nasales y una máquina que controlaba su ritmo cardiaco ya no tenía más aparatos. Por lo menos estos no se veían tan invasivos. Ahora si podía imaginarme que solo dormía. Tomé una silla y me situé a su lado. Tomé su mano y entrelazando sus dedos con los míos me aferré a ella. Sentía su pulso, el mío se acoplaba al ritmo del suyo. Escuchaba el dulce sonido del aire al entrar y salir de su pecho. Definitivamente era mi nuevo sonido favorito. El sueño me perseguía y mi cabeza se tambaleaba de un lado al otro. Mis ojos se cerraban. Lo bueno es que si lo hacían mi último recuerdo sería el de su rostro. Creo que soñaba o tal vez recordaba. Cada momento, cada sonrisa, cada caricia, cada beso. Sabía que debía luchar, sabía que las cosas estaban difíciles pero si podíamos vencer a la muerte, podía vencer al dolor y a su necedad. Ella valía cada momento. Ella valía todo sacrificio. El frío de la madrugada se filtraba en mi piel. Pero lo que me devolvió a la realidad fueron los suaves toques que bailaban en mi cabeza, jugando con mi cabello. Mi rostro buscó la fuente de aquellos toques y se encontraron con los mas grandes ojos cafés mirándome. Mi corazón saltó cuando la dueña de esos ojos habló: - Josh… Hooola :) he querido publicar este capítulo toda la semana.. pero esperaba algun review :/ Bueno.. no me odien demasiado... se q estoy siendo cruel... mucho pero no puedo evitarlo.. esta era la idea desde q empecé a escribir... pero como ven las cosas suceden mas rapidamente :D Espero ansioooooosa sus comentarios.. xfa no me dejen sin ellos.. solo les toma unos minutos ;) Trataré de actualizar lo más pronto ya que desde el lunes tendré un horarios un poco más cómodo x un par de semanas... lo malo es q estoy llena de pruebas :( Nos leemos luego .-.-.-.-.-.z3 MILET AVANCE: – Rara. ¿Qué.. qué sucedió? – Te desmayaste, te pusiste mal. Tú.. tú no despertabas y te ponías peor. Y dijeron que quizás no puedas despertar luego… no podía soportarlo, pero.. pero despertaste y…. – Él balbuceaba y no entendía que decía, solo podía notar que estaba a punto de llorar nuevamente – nuestro bebé… Me tomó por sorpresa. – ¿Nuestro bebé? ¿Sabes… sabes que yo… que estoy embarazada?[Chapter 106] Capítulo 106 Mi cuerpo estaba pesado. Lo sentía amortiguado, lograr moverlo era una tortura. No necesitaba abrir mis ojos para saber donde estaba. El olor a limpio y antiséptico delataba a cualquier consultorio u hospital. Lentamente logré abrir mis ojos encontrandome con la luz que entraba por el pasillo. Mi gargante se sentía rasposa y adolorida. A mi lado, en una mesita, había agua embotellada. Tomó toda mi energía extender mi mano y alcanzarla. Mis músculos estaban agarrotados, como si hubieran pasado días sin ser usados. El agua alivió mi garganta, tuve que evitar llorar cuando abrí mi boca y el dolor de mover mi mandíbula me azotó. Lo último que recuerdo fue dolor. Mucho dolor y la desesperación al no poder respirar. Pero ahora estaba a salvo. Y de una u otra manera espero que mejor. Tenía que vivir. Por mi hijo y… por Josh. Tendría mucho que explicar y será díficil pero si algo me pasa, si no lo logró, Josh tendrá a nuestro bebé. Tengo que sobrevivir por él, tengo que resistir hasta que mi pequeño llegue. Poco a poco tomo conciencia de mi cuerpo y siento un peso contra mis piernas. Con mi cuello rígido trato de ver mejor al chico dormido a mi lado. Sus manos se aferraban a mi manta. Mi mano viaja a su cabello y empiezo a jugar con él. No recuerdo que lo haya tenido tan largo, sin duda he estado tan dsitraída que se me pasó por alto. Lo siento revolverse y gira su rostro para enfrentarme. Sus ojos se abren aún más, como si estuviera sorprendido. No entiendo a que se debe su sorpresa, es verdad, me desmayé pero despertaría en cualquier momento. Su reacción en shock me parece exagerda. Sus ojos siguen mirándome y me doy cuenta que no está respirando. Por un momento no encuentro mi voz, y tratar de hacerlo lastima mi garganta pero de alguna manera lo hago. – Josh… - Estás despierta – susurra luego de un momento. - Si – mi voz es tan rasposa como se siente mi garganta. – Estoy bien. Mis palabras rompen algo en él y un segundo despues se brazos están envolviéndome. - Estas bien. No puedo creerlo, temí tanto que no volvieras. – Su voz empezó a perderse. Sabía que estaba al borde de las lágrimas y sinceramente no lograba entender su reacción. - Josh… - Te amo tanto. – sus manos abarcaban mis mejillas y su frente pegada a la mía. Sus lágrimas caídas se derramaban en mi cuello. – Lo siento… lo siento. Perdóname, por favor. No, no sabes el infierno que he estado viviendo… - Tranquilo. – mumuré enroscando mis brazos a su cuerpo. Mi abrazó lo hizo llorar aún mas. - No me odies – dijo en mi cuello – No puedo soportar perderte. No puedo… Nos quedamos de esa manera por un momento. Cuando logró calmarse acercó la silla a la altura de mi cabeza y se sentó aferrándose a mi mano. - ¿Cómo te sientes? – Rara. ¿Qué.. qué sucedió? – Te desmayaste, te pusiste mal. Tú.. tú no despertabas y te ponías peor. Y dijeron que quizás no puedas despertar luego… no podía soportarlo, pero.. pero despertaste y…. – Él balbuceaba y no entendía que decía, solo podía notar que estaba a punto de llorar nuevamente – nuestro bebé… Me tomó por sorpresa. – ¿Nuestro bebé? ¿Sabes… sabes que yo… que estoy embarazada? SU mirada fue al suelo, las lágrimas brillaban por sus mejillas. Le había hecho daño, él sabía que se lo había ocultado. – Te lo iba decir. – No era excusa, se lo iba a decir. – Créeme, Josh, te lo iba a decir, no quise ocultartelo. Él seguía sin mirarme. No quería que me odie, yo le iba a decir que lo amaba, le iba a decir lo mucho que lo siento por ser una estúpida, le iba a decir que ibamos a ser padres y que si me aceptaba teníamos que hacer mucho para estar juntos. – Josh… – ahora era yo quien lloraba. – No me odies, por favor. – Fue mi culpa. Fue mi culpa que quedarás embarazada. Traicioné tu confianza… pero lo vi como la única salida, no… no podía perderte. – Su mirada era tormentosa. – Son cosas que pasan, Josh, pero ya no importa. – Importa porque tú me pediste que cuidara de ti. – Tomó una bocanada de aire. – Yo sabía que si te embarazabas no podrías alejarte de mí y tú… tú ibas a dejarme y Darío te iba a pedir que te casaras con él… lo siento. Dolía. Dolía tanto saber que me traicionó pero al mismo tiempo tenía que entenderlo. Él tomó una medida desesperada y si no hubiera sido por ello yo nunca habría reconocido que lo amaba. Yo también he estado desesperada. No quería dejarlo ir aunque sabía que debía hacerlo y que pronto me iría. Me estaba echando a morir solo porque no quería enfrentar lo que sentía. Le tenía mas miedo a mis sentimientos que a la misma muerte. – Todo irá bien… yo tambien hice muchas cosas que no debí… yo… yo estoy enferma. – Leucemia. – escupió la palabra. – Aún tienes que echarle ganas a eso. No puedes morir Alex, no puedes dejarte ir. Si tu te vas yo… yo me muero contigo. – No voy a morir. – No por lo menos hasta que me aseguré de que nuestro hijo y él esten bien. – Lamento por no decírtelo, no se lo que pensaba, simplemente no encontraba algo por lo que luchar. – ¿Ni siquiera yo era una buena razón? – preguntó dolido. – Pensaba que estarías mejor sin mí. – Las palabras saliedon de mí y me di cuenta que era verdad. Yo hacía que Josh sufriera y sin mí quizas estaría mejor. – Tú.. tú eres el aire para mí. ¿Cómo estaría mejor sin ti? Cuando él lo dice me doy cuenta de lo estúpida que fui. – Lo siento ¿si? No quiero que me odies, quiero que me ayudes a luchar. Quiero que quieras mucho a este bebé. – Dije acariciando mi vientre. – Él no tiene la culpa por las malas decisiones que he tomado en mi vida. No lo odies por mí culpa. Sus ojos fueron a mi vientre y su mirada se llenó de dolor. Supe que algo iba mal. – ¿Qué le pasó? ¿Qué… qué tiene mi bebé? – No pudo…– su voz se rompía. – No soportó lo que te sucedió. Lo perdiste. El tiempo se detuvo para mí. Todo volvió a ser oscuro en mi vida. Mi bebé se había ido. Por mi culpa. Él no había resistido mi enfermedad. Si yo hubiera estado bien o sin tan solo hubiera evitado que mi enfermedad avanzara… Había matado a mi bebé. Hice lo único que sentí adecuado. Lloré y grité. Lo hice por el gran dolor que sentía. Lo hice por la culpa que me embargaba. Lo hice porque aún existía en este mundo injusto del que ya no quiero formar parte. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Me sacaron de la habitación. Aún podía escuchar sus sollozos y gritos desesperados. Fue la señal para que médicos y enfermeras llegaran y me alejara de su lado. Fue mi culpa. Ella sufría por mi culpa. Porque yo puse en ella un hijo que no debía llegar y ahora que lo perdió y sufre me odiará. - ¿Qué sucedió, Joshua? – Dentro de la sala de UCI todo estaba iluminado por focos, no podías distuinguir que hora del día era. Ya fuera de está la luz de la mañana se filtraba y evidentemente mi tía había llegado. - Despertó. – ¿Y eso no debería ponerte feliz? ¿Porqué está en ese estado? ¿Qué diablos hiciste? – Lo sabe. Sabe que perdió a nuestro hijo. Unos segundos de silencio y luego: – Eres un estúpido. ¿Cómo pudiste decírselo? – No podía mentirle. – gemí. – ¿Sabes lo que has hecho? ¿Pensaste solo un segundo en lo que conseguiste diciéndole? – Se iba a enterar de todos modos. – Si, se iba a enterar, luego de que le explicaramos lo que sucedió, luego de que le hayamos examinado y descartado que una noticia como esa no le provoqué una recaída, luego de que un psicólogo se lo diga evitando que caiga en depresión. Maldita sea, Josh, dices que amas a esa chica y arruinas cada oportunidad que tienes. – Mi tía estaba completamente enojada. Muchas personas pasaban y trataban de no ser tan obvias con lo que escuchaban.– Esa chica se estaba echando a morir y el hijo que concibió le dio ese motivo por seguir peleando y tu vienes y le dices que pedió a la única razón por la que ella quiere seguir. ¿Ves lo que hiciste? Si. Volví a arruinar todo. Volví a dañarla y a herirla. Solo quería ser sincero, solo no quería mentir mas. - Tuvieron que sedarla. – Anunció una enfermera cuando mi tía consultó. – El doctor Cooper está examinándola. – Iré a verla. Tú ve a hablar con su familia y amigos y dale las buenas nuevas. – Sabía que estaba enojada, yo mismo estaba enojado conmigo. – Quiero verla. – No es lo mas sensato en estos momentos. Podrás verla cuando se recupere y eso si… ella quiere verte. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Nuevamente abrí mis ojos. Mi mente estaba nublada y se sentía pesada. Gemí de dolor. – ¿Alex? – La voz de mi madre me sorprendió. – ¿Mamá? – Su cuerpo se apretó contra el mío. Ambas nos fundimos en en abrazos y sollozos. – No sabes lo feliz que me siento de verte, hija. Estaba tan preocuapda, tan angustiada. Tú no despertabas. – Otra extraña reacción. Cualquiera creería que pasaron días. Un momento. Mi mamá estaba en Boston. Ella no pudo llegar aquí en cuestion de horas. – ¿Qué me paso, mamá? ¿Por qué todo mundo actúa como si hubiera estado dormida toda una eternidad? – Solo un poco más de 15 días. Es suficiente para alterarnos a todos. ¿15 días? – ¿15 días? – No entiendo muy bien lo que sucede, solo se que es porque – su voz se quebró – porque entraste en remisión pero.. tú ya sabías eso. – Su voz estaba llena de dolor y decepción. – Lo siento, mamá. – Dije cuando ví las lágrimas caer por su rostro. – Yo no sabía como afrontar todo. Lo siento, no quise hacer daño a nadie. – No se que está pasando por tu cabeza, pero no puedes simplemente echarte a morir. No solo es tu vida, Alexandra. Habemos tantas personas que te queremos y tú simplemente decides morir. – Lo siento. –murmuré. Era todo lo que podía decir. Sabía que le había decepcionado. – No sabes el dolor que se siente saber que tu hija se está muriendo y no puedes hacer nada. No, no sabía el dolor de eso. No sabía lo incapaz que ella debía sentirse. Pero sabía lo que era el dolor de perder a un hijo. Porque mi bebé estaba muerto y todo era mi culpa. Mi mamá debió darse cuenta de sus palabras. – Lo siento tanto. Yo no… no quisé decirlo de esa manera. Hija, lo siento. Tu bebé debe estar en un mejor lugar. – Su abrazó fue más fuerte mientras mis sollozos se ahogaban en su hombro. – Tú bebé esta ahora con su tío. En un mejor lugar. Le diste al cielo un nuevo angelito. Había olvidado que mi mamá tambien perdió un bebé. Ella se había preparadado tanto para tener sus mellizos, pero solo mi hermano vivió. Yo apenas me había hecho a la idea de que iba a ser mamá. – Tendrás otros bebés. La vida sigue cariño y ahora tienes un angelito que te cuida. – No. No tendría mas niños porque pronto me reuniría con mi pequeño o pequeña. La verdad es que no sabía cómo sentirme. Por un lado estaba mi dolor, pero también sabía que Josh sufría. Él también había perdido su bebé . Pero él tenía mucho por lo que vivir. El podría encontrar una persona quien le haga feliz y tener muchos hijos más. Yo... yo ya no podría soportar la culpa, no podía ser lo que él necesitaba. No después de haber matado nuestra hijo. Tuve muchas visitas. Fue bonito ver a mi padre, Santiago, a Fernanda. Incluso fue una agradable sorpresa ver a Michelle. No esperaba que ella estuviera tan alegre al verme. Ella, como todos, sabían lo que había hecho y no creo que este fascinada con la forma en q traté a su hijo. Ella debe saber que soy la única culpable de perder a su nieto, pero la forma en que me abrazó se sentía genuino. Aunque apreciaba su apoyo no eran las personas que precisamente quería y temía ver. Mi médico, el doctor Cooper, me explicó todo y obviamente mi situación no era la mejor. Para ser sincera no estoy sorprendida. Sabía a lo que me atenía cuando dejé que mi enfermedad progrese, pero luego de perder a mi hijo ya no me interesa lo que me suceda. Solo por él quería vivir. – Josh quiere verte. – La doctora Julianne me miró interrogativa. Ella comprendía lo que sentía, por eso pide mi permiso. – Yo… no es lo mejor. No quiero verlo. Su mirada se volvió triste, pero a la vez comprensiva. – Más tarde vendrá el doctor Tepper. – ¿El psiquiatra? No lo necesito. – Lo necesitas aunque no quieras reconocerlo, Alexandra. No solo por el hecho de que te estabas echando a morir lo que claramente podía definirse como suicidio, si no que además, has pasado por mucho, tu bebé, tu enfermedad. Se fue sin recibir respuesta. Odiaba cuando me imponían cosas. No estoy depresiva, simplemente ya no quiero seguir así. Fui sincera. Le conté todo al psiquiatra. Tal vez él entendiera lo que siento y sé que no se lo dirá a nadie más. – A mi parecer Josh y tú son un par de chicos enamorados que tienen una carga pesada de desconfianza y culpa. – Tal vez… – Él lo está pasando muy mal. Lo vi está mañana tratando de escabullirse para verte. Se enteró que tú no quieres verlo y creeme cuando te digo que no he visto nunca a nadie más abatido. Él te ama, y tú igual. No huyas de eso, le haces mas daño de esa manera. – Pero voy a morir… – No digas eso. No pienses en eso. Se que tu situación no es la mejor. Perdiste a tu bebé y te sientes culpable, pero no es así. Son cosas que suceden, Alexandra, pero alejar a Josh no ayuda a ninguno de los dos. Él se siente miserable porque también cree que es su culpa que su hijo muera y al mismo no puede hacer nada para evitar que tu vida se escape. Su único consuelo es verte y tú le quitas eso. – Tomó una gran bocanada de aire. Escuchar esas palabras me hacía sentir peor, si eso era posible. – Alexandra… si tu mueres será el final de ese hombre. Caerá en hoyo del cuál sera practicamente imposible de sacarlo. Se preguntará cada día si pudo hacer algo más… – Por eso debe alejarse. No sufrirá… – Si, lo hará. Pero si tu mueres y él estuvo a tu lado, le dolerá. Mucho. Pero tendrá el consuelo de que tuvo tu amor, que hasta él último minuto lo amaste de la misma manera. Y si cae en ese hoyo por lo menos le podremos decir que tú no querrías verlo de esa manera. Y él lo sabrá, porque tú se lo diras siempre… si es que las cosas se ponen mal. Si es que las cosas se ponen mal. No creo que podrían ir peor. – Hola. – Estaba tan metida en mis pensamientos luego de que el médico se fue, que no había notado a la figura en mi puerta. – Darío… Se que quieren matarme, lo siento tanto x desaparecerme de esa manera. Mi tiempo es limitado y no tengo inspiración :'( tengo que corres así q les dejo este cap,... no quedó como hubiera esperado pero espero que sea de su agrado. Muchas gracias x sus reviews y espero no tardar mucho en actualizar...! Sigan dejandolos... no saben como amo leerlos... ;) MILET:) AVANCE: – Lo siento. – Dije en un susurro. – Creo que un \"lo siento\" no resuelve nada. – Lo sé. Solo quiero que sepas que nunca quise hacerte nada de esto. – ¿No quisiste? – preguntó irónico y obviamente su pregunta fue acertada. ¿No quise? No fue la palabra correcta, lo correcto hubiera sido \"no debí\".[Chapter 107] Capítulo 107 No podía verla. Tenía prohibida la entrada por que ella lo pidio así. Yo me estaba muriendo lentamente cada segundo sin poder verla. Se que esta bien, lo dicen todos, pero no poder constatarlo yo me estaba ahogando. Le había causado dolor y sabía que debía alejarme. Había traicionado su confianza por mis propios motivos egoístas. ¿Dónde quedó ese chico que decía que sería feliz mientras ella lo sería asi sea con otro? No lo sé, solo encuentro a un hombre desesperado, con muchos errores, lleno de egoísmo y… amor. No puedo justificarme con esa palabra. El amor no traiciona y yo lo he hecho, pero sin ella… no se como vivir sin ella. Veía entrar y salir a personas por aquellas puertas, me decían que estaba bien pero no era suficiente. Ya mas tarde todos fueron a casa, ya no había caso quedarnos toda la noche porque nada cambiaría pero yo simplemente me negaba a poner mas espacio entre nosotros. Para la mañana había llegado a mi límite y empecé a idear un plan. Horas mas tarde, tuve que sobornar a un interno para que me prestara su uniforme. Me aseguré que todo estuviera listo para el cambio de turno, ya que mi tía terminaría su turno y entre llegadas y salida de personal médico habría menos personas que puedan atraparme. A veces mi estatura me traía problemas, como ahora cuando tuve que doblar las bastas del pantalón prestado. Me costaba hacerlo ya que mis manos por alguna razon temblaban. No estaba preparado para enfrentarla pero sabía que teníaque hacerlo. Tenía que rogarle por su perdón y por una oportunidad. Confiaba en que si estabamos juntos todo iría mejor. Mi aliado distrajo al guardia de la entrada y aproveché para entrar. Tenía que ir lento para no levantar sospechas. Fingía leer una historia clínica que encontre en la estación de enfermería. Las persianas de su habitación estaban entreabiertas. Me detuve un momento para tomar un respiro y me asomé con cuidado. El aire quedó atrapado en mis pulmones. Mi corazón quedó destrozado ante la imagen. Ya no conseguía encontrar la manera de tenerla. Ya no sabía que más hacer para que se quede a mi lado. Ella iba a tener un hijo mío. Ella había estado enamorada de mí, Fer lo dijo, ese día ella iba a decirme que me amaba. Salí de ese lugar lo más rápido posible. Si no hubiera sido porque tuve que devolver el uniforme habría echado a correr, no quería meter en problemas a nadie más. Como siempre quise refugiarme en el alcohol, no era correcto ni sensato pero la mayoría de veces me había traído recompensas. Había logrado que el dolor desapareciera por un momento mientras me inundaban los recuerdos y al mismo tiempo me habían llevado a ella. Ella me cuidaba y se preocupaba, eran los sentimientos más reales que había sentido de ella. Yo siempre sestía dolor y me sumía en la desesperación. Yo siempre le buscaba y hacía lo imposible por ser feliz. Hacía sacrificios, le entregaba mi vida y ella siempre volví a él. Aún la imagen de su beso rondaba mi cabeza llenandome de ira. Ahora entedía la razón porque ella no me dejaba verla. Solo era el recuerdo de su traición. Debía convencerme de que siempre lo elegiría sobre mí. – Aquí estás. – Si. Había llamado a Claudia porque necesitaba que alguien cuide de mí. – ¿Puedes pedirme un poco de vodka? – Basta, Josh. – dijo molesta. – Estoy harta de verte destruirte por esa chica. Ten un poco de dignidad, ten un poco de amor propio. – Si no quieres verme, vete. Solo quería alguien que se preocupe por mí. – Sabes que no me iré. Sabes que me preocupo por ti, pero tambien me duele verte de esta manera. No eres justo conmigo, Josh. Te quiero, estoy enamorada de ti y tengo que soportar que me uses a tu conveniencia cada vez que ella te hace a un lado. Podía entender su rabia porque cada palabra era cierta. La miro y veo a una gran chica, una de la que quisiera tanto poder enamorarme. Tomé con cuidado su mejilla y luego aventuré mi mano por su cuello. Suavemente la atraje hacia a mí y a pesar de su rabia no puso resistencia. Mi corazón gritaba que no era lo correcto pero mi mente quería demostrar lo contrario. Mis labios se acoplan a los suyos, sin dejar de lado la sensación de no pertenecer a este momento. No eran los labios correctos. – ¿Y eso fue por...? - preguntó cuando nos aportamos. – Fue un beso de despedida, Clau. Tienes razón, no mereces esto, mereces a una persona que se entregue a ti por completo. Eres grandiosa y debes encontrar ese amor por el que respiras. No soy yo esa persona. - apunté cuando iba a replicar. - El verdadero amor siempre será correspondido y yo siempre amaré a Alex. Lo siento por haber sido un imbécil. Pude ver en su expresión que estaba dispuesta a seguir luchando, ella entendía la importancia de luchar por lo que sientes. - ¿Estás seguro de que ella te corresponde? Porque siento que no y a mi parecer ambos estamos en las mismas condiciones, yo contigo y tu con ella. No quiero perder la oportunidad si no estás seguro. Ella tenía un punto. Quizás era un tonto, después de la escena que presencié, pero aún me dejaba conducir por lo que mi corazón me dictaba. - Estoy seguro. Lo que no se es que sucederá con nosotros. Aunque el licor hacia efecto en mi aún razonada lo que decía y sabía que está despedida dolorida de alguna manera. Me encontraba melancólico y triste. Me aferro a Claudia cuando me abrazó. - Espero que todo vaya bien. Espero que ella se recupere y tengan una vida plena, pero si en algún momento te das cuenta que ella no es para ti, búscame. Siempre ocuparás un espacio en mi corazón, Josh. Ademas, siempre tendrás una amiga aunque debes darme un tiempo para asimilarlo. Sonreí.- Tranquila, ya encontraré quien me escuche en estos momentos, pero dame un mes para que te busque. Ante todo, fuiste y eres mi amiga. Levantó una copa. – Ahora brindemos por esos amores difíciles y complicados. – Salud – Dije levantando mi copa. Tomamos hasta que practicamente estuvimos inconscientes y balbuceabamos incoherencias. Mas tarde nos encontrabamos de camino hacia alguna parte, ya que nos echaron del bar. Ni siquiera recordaba porque había bebido, solo que mi corazón aun dolía y tenía que volver a algún lugar. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Debo admitir que lo último que quería hacer era enfrentarlo. Para esta hora el debía saber todo, conocer mi traición. Debe odiarme. Mis ojos cayeron al suelo instantaneamente. Sentía vergüenza. El podía reclamarme un millón de cosas y yo no tenía ninguna posibilidad de defenderme. No quiero que me odie. Yo lo amo. No de la manera en que amo a Josh. Lo que me habian dicho sobre nuestra relación es verdad. Todo era una ilusión, una salida segura para un par de chicos que sentían un cariño especial y una lujuria inespereda. Pero no ese tipo de amor, era algo mas…. Fraternal, como un hermano, como un amigo a quien aprecias demasiado. Debi aceptar eso hace mucho tiempo. Nos hubiera ahorrado todo este enrollo. Lo vi tomar aire para empezar su discurso. – Lamento si interrumpo, pero vamos a llevarle a su nueva habitación. – Una enfermera apareció en la puerta. – Adelante. – Dijo Darío. Ayudo a la enfermera en mi traslado a una habitación normal, fuera de cuidados intensivos a pesar de que según mi doctor y mi historia clínica, que obviamente leí sin permiso, mi condición era precaria. Tomé una baño y definitivamente eso logró milagros con mi cuerpo que paso de ser una masa entumecida excepto por mi pierna izquerda que aun era torpe y no me permitía estabiliazrme de pie. Al parecer todo mi episiodio dejo sus secuelas aunque todos afirmaban que pudo haber sido peor, que definitivamente era una sobreviviente. La verdad me daba igual, solo quería que todo acabara. Darío no me dejo en ningun momento, incluso ayudo a mudarme de ropa, despues de todo no había nada que ocultar, pero aun así me sentí incomoda que me viera de esa manera. Luego de dejarme completamente instalada, la enfermera nos dejo solos. Tomó una silla y se sento junto a la cama. – No se ni por donde comenzar. – Lo siento. – Dije en un susurro. – Creo que un \"lo siento\" no resuelve nada. – Lo sé. Solo quiero que sepas que nunca quise hacerte nada de esto. – ¿No quisiste? – preguntó irónico y obviamente su pregunta fue acertada. ¿No quise? No fue la palabra correcta, lo correcto hubiera sido \"no debí\". – Ya no se puede regresar el tiempo, Alexandra. No te voy a negar que me duele mucho pero sinceramente lo vi venir. – ¿Siempre dudaste de mí, verdad? – No dudé de ti, Alex, dudé de lo que teníamos y no fue hasta que Josh volvió que me di cuenta de que lo de ustedes nunca terminaría. Tenía la esperanza de estar equivocado. – se veía enojado y triste. – Te amo, Alex y se que somos muy buenos juntos, podemos ser lo que el otro necesita pero aunque hagamos todo lo posible no estamos destinados a estar el uno para el otro. Te conozco y se que no quisiste hacerme daño, no se porque lo hiciste tampoco, supongo que simplemente lo de ustedes los llevó a esto. – Te amo también…. – Pero no de la manera en que deberíamos, ¿verdad?. – Asentí. Él me conocía totalmente. – Ya no hay nada que podamos rescatar ademas que nuestra amistad quizas y supongo que yo tambien debo buscar a alguien que me ame de esa manera que tu a Josh. – Mereces que te amen… lo siento por no poder haber sido yo. No es dificil amarte, es facil enamorarse de ti. Sonrío. – Hubiera querido que tú te enamores de mi, no de la idea mí. – Estuve enamorada de ti… – Eso fue hace mucho tiempo y lo arruiné. Era joven y estúpido y perdí mi oportunidad contigo. – Su mano tomó la mía. – No existe el \"si hubiera\" y no voy a fingir que no me importa y que no me heriste, porque lo hiciste… Me heriste y rompiste mi corazón, pero no gano nada comportándome con idiota, eso no va hacer que retroceda el tiempo, no va devolverte a mi lado y no va a hacer que me ames como yo quiero. No pude evitar mis lágrimas cuando vi sus ojos cristalizarse. – Siempre he querido lo mejor para ti. No es justo lo que te está sucediendo… – Es un castigo… – No. No lo mires de esa manera, no has hecho nada para que te suceda algo como esto. – Te traicioné. – Alex… estando conmigo te traicionabas a ti mismo. Querías tanto amarme y olvidar a Josh que no te permitías simplemente ser feliz y volver con él. Si algo malo has hecho eso debió ser castigo suficiente, no esto. – Tengo lo que merezco. – No digas eso. No es justo que sufras. No… no debiste perder a tu bebé, no deberías estar entre la vida y la muerte. – La mención de mi bebé me hizo sollozar. Sus brazos me envolvieron permitiendome desahogar. – No debería pasarte esto pequeña, no a ti. – No se si es o no justo pero quiero que termine…. Quiero irme con mi bebé. – Shhhhh, no hables así, Alex. – sus pulgares limpiaban mis lágrimas - Se que duele ahora, se que todo lo ves oscuro pero todo pasará. Te recuperarás, te casarás, tendrás muchos hermosos pequeñitos y serás feliz. Solo tienes que esperar. No puedes echarte a morir, no puedes dejarnos sin luchar… – Ya no tengo fuerzas, Darío. Ya no encuentro nada bueno por lo que deba vivir. – ¿Y Josh?– La mención de su nombre hizo que mi corazón se estremeciera de dolor. – ¿Qué va a ser de él si lo abandonas sin luchar? – Él no merece sufrir. Él no merecía que lo utilizara de esa manera. Maté a nuestro bebé, Darío. Le he causado dolor tras dolor, ni siquiera yo entiendo como puede seguirme amando. Debería odiarme… – Nunca te odiaría, como yo tampoco podría hacerlo. Solo eres una ser humano que cometió errores y si él comprende eso y sigue intentandolo porque sabe que vales la pena la lucha, yo seguiría haciendolo si supiera que tengo alguna oportunidad. – suspiró – Iba a pedirte que te casarás conmigo. Josh lo sabía. No sabes lo feliz que me hizo decírselo. En mi mente vino el recuerdo de Josh diciendome que Darío quería casarse conmigo. Fue el estímulo que hizo que la idea de embarazarme le sonará atrayente. – Yo… - No tienes que decir nada. Solo quería que sepas que soñaba una vida contigo, lo mucho que deseaba que me dijeras sí y poder quedarme contigo por siempre. – La forma en que lo dices… cualquier persona diría que soy única o especial. – Lo eres, eso no lo dudes. Tienes todo lo que una persona quiere. – No se como puedes estar aquí consolandome cuando deberías estar gritandome por todo lo que hice. – Creéme que estuve enfadado. Quería romperle la cara a Josh por no haberte dejado en paz y a ti quería reclamarte todo pero como te dije, no hubiera sacado nada de ello mas que alejarte y eso no quiero. – Deberías… pareciera que daño todo lo que amo. – Cada cosa irá cayendo en su lugar, pero depende de ti. Tú mejor que nadie sabe lo que lo que las ganas de vivir pueden lograr en alguien. Pequeña, tienes mucho por lo que vivir aunque no lo creas. Tienes tu familia, tienes tus amigos… tienes a Josh. ¿Quieres remediar lo que has hecho? lucha, no lo abandones, demuéstrale que todo ese amor que se tienen sirve de algo. ¿Crees que no lo mereces? Pues llega a merecerlo, pelea por quedarte a su lado como siempre debio ser. – Toda esta conversación es subrealista. – Tienes razón, nadie imaginaría que yo fuera quien te insista que busques a Josh. – Eres maravilloso. – Maravilloso y sexy, no lo olvides. – Este chico siempre podía hacerme sonreír. – Este chico sexy debe irse. Pronto empezaran a llegar todos a visitarte y yo tengo que ir a clases, quisiera quedarme… – Ve, tranquilo, que te quedes no hará que me cure. Mi comentario le sacó una amarga sonrisa. – Lo sé, solo tú puedes cambiar eso. Quiero… quiero pedirte algo. – No creo ser útil en muchas cosas pero adelante, dime. – Un beso… quiero un último beso.– Dijo muy seriamente. Me sorprendió su petición, aunque sentía que estaba traicionando a Josh decidí hacerlo. – Si no quieres, no tienes que hacerlo. – Quiero hacerlo. Por un momento el silencio nos rodeó. Suavemente su mano fue a mi mejilla para luego viajar a mi cuello. Muy despacio nuestros labios se encontraron empezaron a bailar entre sí. No había lujuria pero si cariño. Muchas veces me preguntaba que era lo que faltaba cuando estabamos juntos, ahora sabía que a pesar de lo mucho que nos queríamos, no había amor. – Una vez mas no hace daño. – Podía sentir su sonrisa contra mis labios. – Será dificil olvidarme de esto. Me encanta como se siente. – Mas te vale nunca repetir esas palabras a tus futuras novias. No quiero mas enemigas, por favor. – Siempre les diré lo especial que eres para mí. Además, si llego encontrar a la chica de mis sueños, tendré que amarle mas que a ti, si no no vale la pena. – Creeme que la encontraras, solo debes estar dispuesto a las posibilidades y anunciar que estas soltero. Harán fila por ti. – Es lo que todo hombre sueña. – Junto nuestros labios una vez mas. – Nos vemos luego pequeña. – Nos vemos semental. Oí su risa por todo el pasillo. Me alegra no haberlo perdido. Mas tarde llegaron mis padres y mis amigos. Escuchaba las mismas palabras de todos. Debes luchar. Quería decirles que no podía, que llega un punto en la vida en el cual dejas de pensar en la muerte con miedo para pensarla como una solución, como una forma de escapar del dolor. Solo eran palabras vacías de personas que me amaban. No tenían significado para mí. Decidí dormir apenas se fueron, pensar solo me hacía daño, soñar me permitía ser feliz aunque sea por un rato. Desperté con el sonido de voces en el pasillo. Reconocí la voz de Josh aunque practicamente balbuceaba. – Señor, no puede quedarse aquí en ese estado. – Tengo que verla. Mi puerta se abrió dos segundos después y un muy borracho Josh apareció apenas sosteniendose. Llevaba una guitarra y su ropa muy desaliñada. – Tengo algo… Tengo decirte algo. Empezó a reír por su propia falta de coherencia en sus frases. – No puede quedarse en ese estado. Llamaré a seguridad. – No lo haga. – rogué a la enfermera. – Por favor. Es mi culpa que este así. Haré que se comporte, lo prometo. Me dio una mirada seria antes de asentir e irse. Debió darse cuenta lo dificil que debía ser para alguien ver morir a otra persona y más aun si la ama. Josh se dejó caer en el sofá y trató de entonar en su guitarra. (Otra vez – MDO: www_youtube_com/watch?v=6t-6y261KEw ) . ) . Cada frase me dolía. No entendía su estado pero sabía que quería decirme algo. Dejé que termine su canción aunque parte de mí quería abrazarlo al ver sus lágrimas rodar mientras cantaba. Empezó a sollozar y yo lo hice también. Estiré mi mano hacia él y no dudó en tomarla. Mi corazón temía que me rechazará por el millón de veces que yo lo había alejado. – No me alejes, Alex. – Rogó. Si supiera que mi corazón quería abrazarlo y nunca soltarlo, pero aun creía que lo mejor sería si él se alejara. Pero solo por esta noche, solo por esta vez quiero permitirme la dulzura de estar a su lado una vez mas. – Sube a la cama. Se acercó a mi. Indique que quitara su abrigo y sus zapatos para que setuviera más cómodo. A pesar de su estado, no le costo mucho acomodarse a mi lado y envolverme en sus brazos. Envolverme de paz y calidez. – Te amo tanto que no soy capaz de vivir sin ti. – Eso me temo. – Respondí a un Josh sumido en un profundo sueño. – Yo tampoco puedo vivir sin ti. No lo haré. No viviré, pero tu sí. Mañana sería otro día para buscar soluciones. Para encontrar la manera en la que el chico que amo pueda ser feliz cuando me vaya. Hola :) me extrañaron? lo se lo se.. quieren matarme y torturarme leeentamente. Se que me pierdo mucho pero deben entender q ademas del tiempo ando sin inspiración, lo bueno es q pronto se terminará ... no es bueno.. me he encariñado demasiado con la historia :P Precisamente no esta quedando como querría pero tampoco se como mejorarlo... tenía este cap casi listo desde el sábado y no pude terminarlo hasta hoy.. espero poder actualizar el próximo miercoles antes de entrar a exámenes :( Espero ansiosaaaaaa sus reviews para saber que creen q sucederá y sinceramente creo q amarán el próximo capítulo. Pd: BLARALU: jeje gracias x publicar la historia, actualmente la publico en wattpad y me han pedido permiso para publicarla. se los daré luego de q tu termines :D no les dejes con mucha intriga :) MILET 3 AVANCE: - Nada… olvídalo. – dije secando mis lágrimas con mi antebrazo. - ¿Lloras por ese beso? – preguntó sentandose frente a mí. – No te entiendo, Alex. Me pides que me olvide de ti y te duele verme con otra. Explicame por que te juro que no se que es lo que en verdad quieres. - Vete Josh. – supliqué. Estaba siendo cruel. Tomo mi rostro. - Mírame - No le hice caso, cerré los ojos más fuerte – Alexandra, mírame. Abrí los ojos para encontrarme con dolor en su mirada. - Te lo preguntaré por última vez ¿Por qué demonios llorabas? - Su frente se pegó a la mía.[Chapter 108] Capítulo 108 No sabía como había llegado a su lado, solo sabía que estaba con ella por que mi corazón había dejado de doler. Abrir mis ojos fue una tortura. Maldito alcohol, mi cabeza dolería por un buen tiempo. Su respiración, mi nuevo sonido favorito, era todo lo escuchaba. Sus manos se aferraban a su pecho mientras mis brazos la envolvía. Toque cada rasgo de su rostro, era hermosa. Nadie podía decir que estaba muriendo. Ni yo podía creerlo aún. No solo la estaba matando su enfermedad, ella se estaba dejando morir completamente y yo no podía hacer nada. Ella me apartaba y no podía entender porque aunque se que debería. Por mi culpa ella llegó a perder a nuestro pequeño dejándola destrozada, algo me decía que no era eso. Algo en mi corazón me decía que ella no me culpaba pero aun así quiere que me aleje. Necesito encontrar la manera de que me deje entrar, de que acepte lo que sentimos el uno por el otro y que luche. - No puede quedarse por más tiempo. Si lo ven, estaré en problemas. – dijo una enfermera. - ¿Cómo llegué aquí? - Estaba ebrio preguntando por ella en UCI, le dije que estaba en otra habitación pero que no podía quedarse en ese estado. Tuve que perseguirle por el hospital. Tuvo suerte de no encontrarse con nadie de seguridad. Luego cuando llegó aquí… ella me pidió que lo dejara quedarse. - ¿Ella... ella quisó me quede? No pude evitar ilusionarme. En momentos como estos cualquier muestra de cariño hace que mi alma se llene de más esperanzas. - Si, pero debe irse ahora. Por favor, permitirle quedarse no fue correcto. Tenía razón, no podía permitir que tenga problemas pormi culpa. Volví a ver a mi niña que aún dormía placidamente, no quería dejarla, quería que se levantara a mi lado, quería que se diera cuenta que juntos podríamos lograr todo. Me levante con cuidado de despertarla. Trate de acomodar mi ropa. Antes de salir encontré mi guitarra, ni siquiera recuerdo que hice con ella. En camino a la salida me encontré con mi tía que solo me hizo un asentimiento para que la siguiera a su consultorio. - ¿Cómo está ella? – pregunté. - No mejor. – suspiró. – El tratamiento no ha dejado que su enfermedad progrese pero no ha hecho nada para mejorar. Por el momento está estable, debemos tener confianza en que todo la terapia empezará a funcionar pronto. Todo eran malas noticias. – No se que decir. Solo que me siento derrotado. No se como ayudar. - Sé lo que debes hacer. - Ilúminame, entonces. – Reproché disgustado. - Dale esperanza, dale algo por lo que vivir. Un motivo para que quiera seguir. - ¿Có… cómo? - No estoy seguro de cómo pero tu debes saberlo. Ámala Josh, demuestrale que vale la pena luchar, demuéstrale que ustedes merecen una oportunidad. Muestrale cada cosa buena que hay. – Me abrazó. – Para empezar, puedes sacarle una sonrisa. Tenía razón. La amaba y todo era posible con amor. Y sabía perfectamente cómo podía sacarle una sonrisa. - Solo deseame suerte. Salí totalmente decidido. Había recorrido un largo camino como para darme por vencido ahora. En el pasillo me encontré con Alex en una silla de ruedas siendo llevada por un enfermero. Su rostro se tornó serio cuando me vio. - Hola. - Hola. – dijo suavemente pero sin hacer contacto visual. - ¿Podría dejarnos a solas por un momento? – pedí al enfermero quien se retiró de inmediato. - Veo que estás mucho mejor. - No estoy seguro de lo que hice anoche, pero no lo cambiaría por nada. Necesitaba tanto verte, que me hayas alejado me mataba. Se que debes odiarme… - No te odio, Josh… - la sinceridad de su voz me dio un profundo alivio. – Solo sería mejor si te mantienes lejos. - No digas que es mejor para mí. Solo dejame quedarme a tu lado. – Tomé su mentón para mirarla directo a los ojos. – Alguien que ama de la manera que yo lo hago no puede mantenerse lejos. Se quedo un momento en silencio ntes de decidirse a mirarme. – No mas palabras de amor, Josh. Por favor. No quiero mas declaraciones, ni siquiera una insinuacion y podrás verme cuando quieras. Era un precio alto, pero me estaba dando una salida. – Hecho. - Me tengo que ir. Yo tengo mi primera sesión de radioterapia. Regresar a la realidad sobre su enfermedad me cayó como un balde de agua fría. – Claro, ve. Nos vemos luego. Besé su mejilla antes de decirle al enfermero que continuara su camino y dirigirme a mi nueva misión. Punto número uno: conseguir una sonrisa genuina. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O– O – O – O – O – O – O Tomografías, ajustes, radioterapia, aíslamiento, pruebas, etc. Me regresaban a mi habitación casi 4 horas después. En el pasillo escuché la voz de Josh y el sonido de su guitarra. Me tomó dos segundos darme cuenta que era una de esas canciones que aparecen en alguna de las series en Disney Chanel. Abrí mi puerta y me llevé una gran sorpresa. Unos pequeños brazitos se arrojaron a mi cuello practicamente sacandome todo el aire. Estreché a mi pequeñuela contra mí. – Alex, te extrañé mucho mucho mucho. ¿Por qué estás aquí? Josh me cantaba mis canciones favoritas. Él canta bonito. Fue a mi casa y le pidió a mi mami que me deje ir con él y me compró un helado de chocolate antes de venir aquí. La energía de Sammy se contagiaba fácilmente. – Gracias por traerla. – Le dije a un muy sonriente Josh. Me ayudaron a llegar a mi cama. Sammy rapidamente subió a mi lado hablando a mil por hora sobre su regreso a la vida escolar. Ahora estaba sana, y crecía como cualquier niña de su edad. Recuerdo lo raro y emocionante que se siente salir de un hospital y poder correr, jugar, sin temer hacerte un gran moreton un buen golpe que pueda provocarte una hemorragia. - ¿Cuándo me llevarás de nuevo a un parque, Alex? – preguntó mi pequeña entusismada. - Te llevará cuando salga de aquí.- contestó Josh. No quería responder esa pregunta porque no podía prometerla algo que iba a cumplir. - ¿Lo prometes? – preguntó con los ojos abiertos como platos. No quería decepcionarla. Josh me miraba intensamente sabiendo exactamente lo que pensaba. – Lo prometo princesa. Un abrazo y un beso después empezó a saltar en mi cama. – Josh, deberías cantarle una canción a Alex, como las que me cantaste a mí. - Mmmmmm, no estoy seguro de ello. – dijo mirándome. Habíamos quedado en nada de declaraciones, insinuaciones, ni palabras de amor. Sin duda una canción iba a ser dificil. – Creo que tengo la indicada. - Si me dices la canción puedo cantarla contigo. Josh tomó a Sammy y le dijo algo en el oído, haciendola sonreír. Se colocó en una silla y empezó a tocar. Como buena fan de Disney Channel reconocí la canción. (Not a love song – Ross Lynch: www_youtube_com/watch?v=bdmv-bsMo-Q ) Mi mirada y la de Josh se cruzaron sin separarse durante toda la canción. Sammy cantaba en voz alta bailando por toda la habitación. Cuando terminó de cantar Josh se sentó tambien en mi cama. – Si lo analizas detenidamente no he roto mi promesa. No es una canción de amor. Me eché a reír sin poder evitarlo. El era tan tonto y absurdo y aun así podía llenarme de alegría. Pasamos el resto de la tarde jugando con la pequeña, hace mucho tiempo no me había divertido de esa manera, olvidandome de todo lo malo que ha sucedido. Luego decidimos ver una película de barbie que pasaban en televisión. No pude evitar notar la cecanía de Josh. Su espalda estaba contra el espaldar de la cama, mi cabeza en su hombro y mi cintura envuelta por su brazo con Sammy entre nosotros. Debíamos ser un cuadro conmovedor. Josh recibió un mensaje. – Sammy, tú mamá ya vino por ti. Está esperando fuera. - No quiero irme.- dijo haciendo un puchero. - No queremos que tú mama se enoje. – le dije acariciando su rubio cabello que había brotado luego de la terapia. – Podrás visitarme cuando quieras. - Esta bien. Te visitaré hasta que te cures y luego me llevarás al parque. - Trato. – Dije dandole un beso. Josh llevó a Sammy con su mamá avisándome que volvería. Empecé a cambiar de canales para ver algo de noticias. Había estado fuera del mundo mucho tiempo. Como siempre terminé con un programa de espectaculos que captó mi atención ya que anunciaron una noticia sobre Josh. Odio estos programas, habían sido una gran piedra en el camino durante toda nuestra relación, pero no podía evitar verlos cuando hablaban de él. Quería cerrar mis ojos cuando vi aquel video. Había sido tomado la noche anterior. No pude evitar que lágrimas se derramaran por mis ojos. Mi corazón se deshacía en pedazos, lo que era ilógico ya que era lo que se supone que quería: que Josh continuara con su vida. Pero verlo besar a otra chica, a Claudia, no deja de dolerme. Se supone que esos son mis labios, se supone que cada caricia debería ser para mí porque yo la inspiro. Vivo en un mundo de imposibilidades, de cosas que no deberían ser pero son. Debería poder quedarme a su lado, no verlo querer a alguien más, como probablemente está pasando. No pude sostener el sollozó que se escapó desde mi alma. - ¿Porqué lloras? Josh había regresado y se apresuró a mi lado. Aunque ya había terminado la nota apagué el televisor rapidamente. Tení la esperanza que no se diera cuenta de lo que vi. - Nada… olvídalo. – dije secando mis lágrimas con mi antebrazo. - ¿Lloras por ese beso? – preguntó sentándose frente a mí. – No te entiendo, Alex. Me pides que me olvide de ti y te duele verme con otra. Explicame por que te juro que no se que es lo que en verdad quieres. - Vete Josh. – supliqué. Estaba siendo cruel. Tomo mi rostro. - Mírame - No le hice caso, cerré los ojos más fuerte – Alexandra, mírame. Abrí los ojos para encontrarme con dolor en su mirada. - Te lo preguntaré por última vez ¿Por qué demonios llorabas? - Su frente se pegó a la mía. - No quiero verte con ella. - Susurré con nuevas lágrimas en los ojos. De verdad estaba siendo patética, esas palabras no debí decirlas. Estaba arruinando todo lo que quería para él. -¿Por qué? -Yo... -¿Tú que Alexandra? Dilo de una maldita vez. – Su nariz estaba en mi cuello, rozandolo suavemente, haciendome desear su contacto.. - Te amo – le dije con más fuerza de lo que esperaba. - Tenías razón, estoy loca de amor por ti. No pude decir más porque tomó sus labios y los juntó con los míos. Fue comosi hubiera encendido un gatillo, porque su contacto me llevo al cielo por un momento. – Entonces, quédate conmigo… Sus ojos me miraban llenos de esperanza y amor. Quería tanto decirle que sí, que solo quiero estar con él, que es todo lo que deseo, pero no puedo. No puedo atarlo a una vida que quizás se acabé pronto. – No puedo… Se apartó de mí como si mi contacto le hiciera daño. Caminó varias veces por la habitación, frustrado. – Tú... – dijo señalándome con su dedo – Tú no quieres que yo esté contigo, ni tampoco que esté con otras personas… ¿Qué tan miserable esperas que sea para que estés feliz? - No… yo no quiero que seas miserable. Quiero que seas feliz. – Las lágrimas seguían cayendo por mis mejillas. - ¿Entonces porque no me dejas estar contigo? – prácticamente suplicaba. - ¿Porque no puedes amarme…? Fue como si hubiera encendido el interruptor de furia. – Discúlpame si te ofendí con tanto amor. Lamento mucho si no soy lo suficiente para ti. Perdóname por darte todo lo que soy. – Su sarcasmo me hería. Él no entendía que solo trataba de protegerlo. No quiero arrastrarlo conmigo, porque él me ama de la misma manera que yo a él. Si algo le sucediera, yo simplemente moriría con él. Pero yo ya no quiero seguir en este infierno. Ya no puedo más… ya no puedo vivir con culpa, ya no puedo seguir haciendo daño a todos los que me rodean. - Lo siento. – Lo sentía. Lo sentía por no ser lo suficientemente fuerte como para levantarme y seguir luchando. Lo sentía por no poder evitar hacerle daño. Una vez estuvo a mi lado. Su mano se aventuró por mi cuello hasta la parte trasera y la otra viajaba por mi brazo. – Solo dime una vez que me amas. Quiero saber que no fue solo un sueño y tal vez así pueda entenderte porque no lo hago. No entiendo cómo puedes decirme esas palabras y mantenerme lejos. - No puedo.- Susurré. Mi aliento se mezclaba con el suyo. - Dime… solo una vez más. – Mis ojos estaban cerrados. - Cada vez que lo digo se vuelve más real y no quiero hacerte más daño… no puedo… porque no quiero que te duela cuando me vaya… La compresión llegó a él con mi confesión. Quería tragarme mis palabras. - No te vas a morir. - Si lo voy a hacer… yo ya no quiero estar aquí, ya no tengo ganas de seguir, ya no… - ¿Me amas? Dímelo… Por favor. – Suplicó. - Te amo. – Respondió mi corazón y mi mente no pudo hacer nada para retener las palabras. Sus labios eran suaves con los míos. No había pasión ni desesperación. Solo dulzura. Solo breves roces, breves juegos de nuestros labios con los del otro. Breves caricias llenas de dulzura. - Entonces lucha, Alex. Si me amas, vive por mí y te prometo que no volverás a sufrir este tipo de dolor nunca más. Te prometo hacer que cada día de tu vida valga la pena. Me desviviré por ello. Solo… acéptame a tu lado y déjame que destruya el mundo y rompa los cielos para darte todo lo que te mereces. - No puedes prometerme eso… debes odiarme… debes ser feliz… - me atragantaba en mis sollozos. Me colocó sobre su regazo y yo me deje encerrar en sus brazos. – Te amo y tú eres mi única felicidad. Se que si estamos juntos saldremos de esta, solo tienes que confiar en mí lo suficiente como para creer en que todo estara bién. – tomó mi rostros entre sus manos. - ¿Confías en mí? Tenía que decir, si lo hacía sería el fin de lo que hay entre nosotros. Sería lo mejor para él. Pero era tan egoísta. Lo amaba con locura y a pesar del dolor que siento sabía que él podría hacerme completamente feliz. Confiaba en él. – Confío en ti. Creo que ambos soltamos lágrimas. En cuanto dije sus palabras sabía que tenía una larga batalla, porque ya no luchaba por m vida, si no por lo de la persona que mas amaba. Nos acomodamos en mi pequeña cama, aferrados al otro. Josh jugaba con mis dedos. A pesar de la felicidad que emanaba, sabía que algo le molestaba.- ¿Qué es? Me miró por un momento antes de entender mi pregunta. Yo lo conocía tan bien como él y Josh lo sabía. - ¿Cómo van a ser las cosas ahora? ¿Estás conmigo? ¿Sigues con Darío? Sonreí. Mi chico celoso, ni porque le decía lo mucho que lo amaba, que solo por él seguiría viviendo deja sus inseguridades. – Darío….se acabó. - Pero… pero ese beso.. - ¿Nos viste? – pregunté sorprendida. - ¿Es por eso que te emborrachaste? – asintió con timidez. – Fue… una despedida. Ambos comprendimos que lo de nosotros no era exactamente verdadero amor. Tarde o temprano ibamos a terminar aceptandolo, auqnue no debía ser de esta manera. – Nunca debí engañarlo de esa manera. Él no lo merecía, pero no quería que Josh se sintiera mal. – Digamos que éramos dos personas que caminaban juntos pero con distintos destinos. Debía llegar el momento en que cada una girara hacia su lado. - Me encanta cuando sacas tu vena poética. – besó mi frente – Ya quiero gritarle al mundo que estamos juntos. Se siente… se siente como un sueño, aun no puedo creer que es verdad. Temo que en cualquier momento abrá los ojos y me de cuenta que no he podido recuperarte. Que aun estás en brazos de otro y que yo no puedo seguir aunque sepa que eres feliz. Siempre he sido egoísta en lo que se refiere a ti. Podía decir miles de veces que mietras tu seas feliz yo también lo sería pero lo cierto es que solo quiero que seas feliz a mi lado. - Lo siento por todo. – las palabras salieron de mi corazón. – Lo siento por estar llena de inseguridades y no haberte creído cuando me dijsite que no quisiste engañarme. Me asusté, Josh. He tenido una buena vida pero también he vivido momentos oscuros. Tenía miedo de que todo lo que teníamos, todo ese amor me iba a destruir y fue fácil dejarlo ir a la primera oportunidad. No creo que haya desconfiado de ti, creo que desconfie de mi mísma, de no ser lo suficientemente buena para ti como para que en verdad me ames y no me dejes por alguien más. Te he hecho pasar por tanto, te he obligado a demostrarme de mil maneras que harías todo por mí…. No fue justo… - Tampoco fue justo lo que nos sucedió… pero ahora es tiempo de preocuparnos por nuestro futuro y no por el pasado. Ya no podemos cambiarlo. Solo quiero pasar cada minuto posible del resto de mi vida contigo. - Yo también, mi Peeta.- fue un lindo detalle que usase esa frase.- Tenemos mucho por que luchar. - No te dejaré sola, nunca. – susurró. - ¿Es una amenaza? Su sonrisa coqueta apareció. - Es una promesa. Hooola :) perdonen x perderme creanme cuando digo q el tiempo no m alcanza y mas aun q empiezo exámenes.. tenía este cap desde la semana pasada pero no m convencía del todo.. creo q la reconciliación debía ser mas... intensa, pero no creo que lo logré, asi que espero q les guste. :P Quedan muy pocos capítulos, no se cuantos exactamente, pero como ven a los chicos les queda todavía una pelea más.. q creen q sucederá? QUisiera saber lo q esperan para el final.. quieren epílogo? diganme su final hipotético y q quisieran leer si hay epílogo :) Nos leemos lo mas pronto q pueda :P MILET AVANCE: - No se como no puedes tenerme asco. – No me gustaba escuchar hablar de sí misma con desprecio. – Quizás me quede sin cabellos, mi piel se volverá gris, endelgazaré hasta quedar solo huesos. Voy a estar horrible… ¿Me querrás en ese estado, Josh? Tome sus mejillas y limpié sus mejillas con mis pulgares. Sus ojos estaban rojos y su piel pálida reflejaba su estado. – Te querré mas que nunca… te he amado desde que te conocí, te amo hoy, te amaré siempre y mucho mas cuandome doy cuenta lo dificil que es amarme y como luchas por seguir solo por nuestro amor. – Sus ojos ya cristalizados querían derramar más lágrimas. - Espero que eso resuelva tus dudas.[Chapter 109] Capítulo 109 Todo se sentía tan irreal. No podía creer que ella era mía nuevamente. Solo mía, no debía compartirla con nadie. Y me amaba. Lo había dicho. Ella había dicho que amaba. Me amaba tanto que quería asegurarse de que yo pudiera ser feliz cuando ella… cuando ella se fuera. Pero ella no iba a morir, no lo iba a permitir. Sería su roca, sería su sostén mientras ella lucha por vivir, por mí,por nuestro amor. Ahora sabía las verdaderas razones por las que ella me quería lejos, ahora sabía por que lo de nosotros siempre fue tan dificil. Todo me hace amarla aún más, dedicar mi vida por completo a su cuidado, a idolatrarle como se lo merece. Ninguno le había dicho a nadie que ahora estabamos juntos. Quería gritarlo a los mil vientos pero lo mejor era ser prudente y avanzar paso a paso. - ¿Sabes lo mucho que amo abrazarte de esta manera? – Ya la noche nos rodeaba y no me había separado en todo el día de ella. Nos habíamos acurrucado en su pequeña cama mientras conversábamos de un montón de cosas. Las enfermeras iban y venían, nuestro cuadro debió parecerles conmovedor porque nadie mencionó que no debía tomarme esas atribuciones en un hospital. - No deberías acostumbrarte, no creo que nos dejen repetir este día. – su mano acariciaba mi mentón. – Debieron notar lo feliz que soy ahora. No quieren quitarme eso aún… La tristeza inundaba su alma, podía verlo en sus ojos. – No eres la única que está feliz. ¿Y sabes que es lo meor de todo? Que habrá muchas de estas ocasiones. Sonrío tristemente. – Eso espero. Mis manos se aventuraron por su cintura, quería estar totalmente en contacto con ella, quería que no nos separara ni un centímetro. Quería fundirme a su cuerpo. Correspodió a mi beso con la misma fuerza que yo imponía. Estaba en el mismísimo cielo, pero, diablos si sentía que ardía. - Deberíamos detenernos. – Murmuró tomando mi labio inferior entre sus dientes. Si seguía por este camino pronto tendría que echarle llave a la puerta. - ¿Quieres que nos detengamos? – gemí en su cuello. - No. No quiero, pero debemos. – sus voz se había convretido en gemidos, también. Ninguno se detenía. - JOSHUA. – la entridente voz de mi tía nos hizo saltar del susto. Practicamente caí de la cama. – No puedo creer esto. Están en un sitio público. Tú…- dijo apúntando a Alex con el dedo. – Tienes una intravenosa que está llenandose de sangre por tanto movimiento. - Lo siento tía pero debes entendernos. - ¿Qué debo entender? – dijo colocando sus manos en la cintura. - Mira a esta chica. – dije señalándo a mi niña. - ¿Te das cuenta lo sexy que es? ¿cómo puedo resistir no tocarla? ¿Sabes la respuesta? No. No puedo apartar mis manos de ella, cada vez que la tengo cerca me caliento y me derrito como una helado en un día soleado. Lo admito, con ella soy un manojo de hormonas, y… donde reina hormona? - No manda neurona. – respondió Alex completamente sonrojada pero con una gran sonrisa. Mi tía no pudo evitar reírse. – Me alegra que estén juntos, chicos, pero que sea la última vez que deshonran este lugar. Una gran sonrisa se formó en mi rostro. Alex leyó mi mente. – No lo digas. - Oh sí. – respondí mirandola ponerse totalmente colorada. – Pues mi querida tía. Lo que acabas de presenciar no es nada comparado con las otras cosas que hemos hecho aquí. Asi que tu querido hospital ya ha sido \"deshonrado\". Una almohada golpeó mi cara. Las voces de ambas mujeres se escucharón por la habitación. – JOSH. Me eché a reír. Abracé a mi chica. – Lo siento mi amor, pero mi tía debía saber que ya no había nada que pudiera hacer. - Te odio. – El rubor de su rostro le hacía ver mas viva. - Solo venía a decirte que mañana empezarás con un nuevo tratamiento. - ¿Quimioterapia? – preguntó Alex y mi tía asintió. - Se supone que debo decir como vas a sentirte, pero lo sabes.- El rostro de mi niña se volvió sombrío mientras asentía. – No puedes quedarte otra noche aquí, Josh. - Pero… - Nada de \"pero\". Mañana te conseguiremos un permiso pero hoy no. – odiaba cuando usaba el tono de mamá regañona. – Nos vemos mañana. - No me quiero ir. - Tienes que. Debes descansar, tiene un aspecto horrible. – Su mano acaricó mis mejillas y mentones haciendo que mi barba emitiera un sonido al rozarla. – Mereces un buen sueño, una buen baño y una buena comida. - Lo único que quiero es quedarme a tu lado. Posó sus labios sobre los míos. –Ve, Josh. – Su mirada me decía que no la contradijera. - Esta bien. Pero no te desharás tan facilmente de mí. Estaré aquí temprano. - No tan temprano. – la miré inquisitivamente. – No… no quiero que me veas en… esa situación. No me costo mucho entender a lo que se refería. Había leído sobre los efectos secundarios de la quimioterapia. Ella no quería que la viera en esas condiciones. Aún no comprendía que mientras voy a estar a su lado en todo momento. - No digas eso, cariño. – entrelacé nuestros dedos. – No me separeré de ti para nada. En la salud y en la enfermedad ¿verdad? Sonrío. – Esos son los votos de un matrimonio. - Lo sé. Pero nos casaremos una vez que pasemos por esto. Pero te amo ahora y eso no va a cambiar aunque no tengas un anillo en ese dedo. Quiero cada momento, te quiero en las buenas y en las malas. Solo… ¿Qué harías tú en mí lugar? – tomé su mentón para mirarla – Se que harías lo mismo. Que no me dejarías por nada, porque me amas y eso es lo que hace el amor. Abrazar las cosas buenas y malas. - Te amo. – susurró. La noche fue larga sin ella. Tenía miedo de que al alejarme de ella pueda cambiar de opinión con respecto a nosotros. Pero tenía que tener confianza, ya no había espacio para las inseguridades. Cada segundo se hizo eterno hasta que pude volver a su lado. Llegué justo a tiempo para ver al oncólogo colocar la medicación. Me acomodé a su lado envolviéndole en mi brazo. Bese su frente y ella me regalo una sonrisa triste. Nos dejaron solos. Alex veía como el líquido caía gota a gota para ingresar en su sangre. Lo veía como si fuera el culpable de todo. - ¿Cuándo aprendiste a nadar? - Se sorprendió por mi pregunta trivial. – En Malvidas nadabas, ya no solo flotabas. Quería saber cuando aprendiste. - No lo sé, supongo que solo era cuestión de patalear. Cuando recién entre al posgrado tenía que obtener maneras de relajarme y había una piscina cerca de mi casa… creo que en algún momento aprendí. - Eso es estupendo. Ya no tengo que preocuparme porque te ahogues. Aunque pensándolo bien, tendré que buscar otra excusa para darte respiración boca a boca. - Tú siempre buscas excusas para besarme. – Empezó a sonreír antes de que su rostro se tornara afligido. Le pasé rapidamente el recipiente que había dejado la enfermera. Vació lo poco que contenía su estómago. Arcada tras arcada sentí como se le iban las fuerzas. Daría cualquier cosa por estar en su lugar con tal de no verla sufrir de esa manera. Hizo gargaras con agua antes de recostarse a un lado en la cama dándome la espalda. No sabía que decirle para que se sintiera mejor. Ella estaba tan llena de frustración como yo. Sentí su cuerpo estremecer por los sollozos que ya no podía retener. - Tranquila – acaricié su brazo. - No deberías estar aquí. No soporto que me veas de este modo. – Lo díficil era hacerle entender que no me alejaría de ella por nada pero que al mismo tiempo quería salir corriendo porque odiaba verla de esa manera. - No me voy a ir. Siempre, ¿recuerdas? – Logré acercarle a mi cuerpo. – Voy a vivir contigo para siempre. Tendrás que ver mi mal aspecto, mi desorden y muchas cosas peores. Y aprenderemos a amar esas cosas. - No se como no puedes tenerme asco. – No me gustaba escuchar hablar de sí misma con desprecio. – Quizás me quede sin cabello, mi piel se volverá gris, endelgazaré hasta quedar solo huesos. Voy a estar horrible… ¿Me querrás en ese estado, Josh? Tome sus mejillas y limpié sus mejillas con mis pulgares. Sus ojos estaban rojos y su piel pálida reflejaba su estado. – Te querré mas que nunca… te he amado desde que te conocí, te amo hoy, te amaré siempre y mucho mas cuando me doy cuenta lo dificil que es amarme y como luchas por seguir solo por nuestro amor. – Sus ojos ya cristalizados querían derramar más lágrimas. - Espero que eso resuelva tus dudas. Sus brazos se envolvieron en mi cuello. Esperaba que mis palabras no dejaran duda a mi devoción por ella. Nos acomodamos en la pequeña cama. Alex se quedó dormida en mis brazos. No se dio cuenta cuando cambiaron su medicación. Yo solo no podía alejarme de ella ni un instante. Estaba decidido a no dejar que flaquee. Al parecer yo también había dormido porque cuando abrí mis ojos me encontré con mis suegros mirandonos atentamente. Alex aún dormía plácidamente y algo me decía que no despertaría. Estaba agotada. - ¿Alguien me explica que pasa? – dijo mi suegro mirando de nosotros a su esposa. - ¿Deberíamos llamarte hijo o aún es novia de Darío? – dijo mi suegra. - Te juro que ya no entiendo la dinámica de esta chica y sus novios. No logró acostumbrarme a uno y ya está con otro. Eso lo heredó de ti. – No pude evitar que se me escapara una risita ante la cara de angustia del padre de Alex. - ¿De mí? No lo creo señor tengo 3 novias al mismo tiempo. Si mal no recuerdo tú eras un mujeriego. – Reprochó mi suegra. Definitivamente era divertido escucharlos. - No tendrán que preocuparse mas por eso. Ahora estamos juntos y será así por siempre. - Eso ya lo he escuchado. – dijo mi frustrado suegro. - No dejaré que se me escape. - Eso dijiste la última vez. Prometiste que no le harías daño. Entendía su posición. – Basta. – interrumpió la mamá de Alex. – No es momento de discutir cosas que ya pasaron. Me alegran que esten juntos, Josh y espero que esta vez sea la definitiva. - Ya no hay nada que nos separe. – aseguré confiando en que sea de esa manera. - Eso espero. – Su ceño triste me dio una pista de hacia donde iban sus pensamientos. – Tienes que sacarla de ese hoyo en que se ha metido. - Ella… me prometió luchar. Le prometí el mundo a cambio. Pude ver una sonrisa sincera en el rostro de ambos. – Si logras que no se de por vencida, no tendremos manera de compensartelo. – Dijo mi suegro. - No hay anda que compensar… si algo le sucediera… no puedo estar sin ella. Que Alex este bien es todo lo que necesito. – las palabras salían de mi corazón. - ¿Cómo estuvo el tratamiento? – preguntó con cariño su madre, mientras acariciaba la frente de Alex. - Mucho vómito. Está cansada, dudo que despierte hoy. Asintió tristemente. – Lo imagino. Gracias por estar con ella, se que en mejores manos no puede estar. Imagino que tu eres quién solicito el permiso para pasar la noche aquí. Quisimos conseguir uno pero ya lo conseguiste. - Lo… lo siento por tomar esas atribuciones. No quiero dejarla ni por un segundo… no pensé en que usted…- me sentía averginzado. - Tranquilo. Lo mereces. Nosotros nos hemos tenido que ocupar de un millar de trámites. El seguro, el posgrado, el hospital. Todo es una locura en este país con sus benditas leyes. - Ella entenderá porque no estan aquí. Creo que se siente mas aliviada mientras menos personas la miran atravesar por esto. – Ni siquiera quería que yo la mire en ese estado. - Me rompé el corazón pensar que tiene que pasar por todo esto nuevamente. – su voz se rompió en la última palabra. - Será mejor que volvamos mañana temprano. No es bueno despertarla, tiene que recuperar sus energías. – mi suegro abrazó a su esposa. - No la dejaré ni un momento. - Repetí. – Vayan tranquilos. Se despidieron y me agradecieron nuevamente. Podía entender los sentimientos de incapacidad que tenían al no poder hacer nada por su hija. Me separé un momento de Alex para poder ponerme ropa más cómoda. Me había asignado un sofá cama para dormir pero en cuanto apagaron las luces del pasillo, me escabullí junto a mi niña. Desperté cuando pequeños roces jugaban en mi rostro. Abrí mis ojos para encontrame con los de mi chica confirmandome que todo era realidad. – Buen día. - Buen día, pequeña. - La enfermera de turno dijo que si no utilizabas el sofá-cama esta noche, se aseguraría de que duermas en el suelo. - Nada hará que duerma lejos de ti. – mi niña sonrío y con ello mi día se iluminó. - Ayer vinieron tus papás. No quisieron despertarte pero se sienten mal por no poder estar mucho tiempo a tu lado. - No tienen porque estarlo, me imagino el trabajo que les he dado por estar aquí. – dijo aflijida. - No digas eso, pequeña. – Besé su frente. – Nada de culpas. Nos quedamos acurrucado un rato más rodeados por el cómodo silencio, hasta que ella lo rompió. - ¿Qué… que sucedió con Claudia? - Habías tardado en preguntar. – Había querido aclararle lo de ese beso desde que sucedió pero tantos acontecimientos me lo habías quitado de la cabeza. – Fue una despedida, un último adios. - ¿Porqué tuvo que ser un beso? – preguntó molesta. - ¿Sabes que podría hacerte la misma pregunta, verdad? – dije llenandome de ira al recordar su imagen con Darío. – No pensé que alguien nos grababa. - Admítelo Josh, tú vida personal es de conocimiento público. – Tenía razón. – Han había constantes en nuestras relación. Prensa entrometida detrás de cada uno de tus pasos, mis malas decisiones y tus borracheras. Son cosas con las que debemos empezar a lidiar de mejor manera. - Lo siento. Amo actuar pero no soy feliz con todo el paquete. Y lo de las boracheras… digamos que fue una forma de escape, mi subconsciente sabía que no me dejarías en ese estado, cada vez conseguía tu atención, conseguía que me buscarás… conseguía mucho. - No lo vuelvas a hacer. – dijo seriamente tomándome del mentón. – Por lo menos no lo hagas por esos motivos. - No creo que vuelva a hacerlo. Ahora te tengo y no necesito de nada para tener un poco de ti. Su mirada se volvió sombría. – No quiero que pienses que no estoy cumpliendo lo que te prometí, porque en serio, estoy luchando, pero si algo me pasa… no… no recurras a ello ¿Sip? Oírle decir eso me rompía. – No digas eso… - Tenemos que ser realistas. Entendía lo que decía, pero en mi mente no cabía esa posibilidad. – Prométeme por nuestro amor y por nuestro niño que darás todo de ti. Sus ojos se cristalizaron ante la mención de nuestro bebé, pero sabía que no sería una promesa vacía si lo juraba por él. – Lo prometo. Lucharé hasta el final… por ti. - No solo por mí, debes hacerlo por ti. - Lo hago por ti… por ti y por que quiero tener la oportunidad de tenerte. Eso es por mí, si no cumplo ello estaré muy enfadada. Quiero una vida a tu lado. Sus palabras hicieron que mi corazón se acelerara. – La próxima vez que me embriague será contigo y en una noche de juerga. Sonrío - Gracias por quedarte a mi lado. - Siempre. No puedo creer q estemos tan cerca del final... no se como terminar la historia, no se como asimilarlo... me he encariñado tanto con los personajes... espero q les haya gustado el capítulo. lamento por demorar tanto pero estoy en exámenes y creanme que no avanzo mucho. Espero q me sigan en wattpad: www_wattpad_com/user/Milet7393 donde publicaré mis próximas historias :) espero su apoyo con ellas y estoy complacida porque hayan seguido la historia hasta ahora... igual quiero leer sus comentarios sobre lo q creen q asar y como quieren q acabe todo.. si desean epílogo y esperan leer en él :P Sin mas tiempo (xq tengo q estudiar pediatría :( ) me despido :) Nos leemos luego .-.-.-.-MILET AVANCE: – No se lo digan a Josh… por favor. Sus miradas incrédulas me atravesaron. – Es una buena noticia para él. Deberías decirle la buena nueva, necesita algo para que no esté tan… afligido. Sabía que Josh se mostraba fuerte a mi lado y que fuera de aquí podía desmoronarse. Odiaba destruirlo solo por mi egoísmo a retenerlo. – Por favor. Tengo mis razones.[Chapter 110] Capítulo 110 - ¿Podría acercarme mi historia clínica? – la enfermera me vio nerviosa ante mi petición. Quería verla, nadie me decía mi situación y no saberlo me deseperaba. Josh había ido a su departamento a cambiarse y aprovecahría para ir por la empresa y traer mi computadora. Quería trabajar, me sentía tan inutil y frustrada. La enfermera regresó con mi ficha. Nadie podía negarse a entregar un documento que era de mi propiedad. Lo tomé con cautela. Empecé desde el inicio, analizando en que estado llegué a este lugar. Algo en mi orden de ingreso llamó mi atención, fue escrita por un paramédico. Paciente femenino encontrada en síncope con disnea, cianosis, taquipnea, taquicardia, aparente hemoptisis y su temperatura de 38.5°C. Presenta estertores crepitantes diseminados por ambos campos pulmonares, presión de oxígeno de 50 mmHg, Presión CO2 de 35mmHg. Diagnóstico presuntivo Tromboembolia Pulmonar. Se administra oxígeno y canaliza vía venosa periférica. Solicitamos ingreso en cuidados intensivos, TAC y preparación para cirugía menor de adminsitración de cateter central de confirmarse diagnóstico. Llamada a emergencia por desconocidos, pero reconocida por el Sr. Joshua Hutcherson quien asegura que \"es su mujer\" y la identifica con sus respectivos datos. Su estado no permite indagar sobre la situación por lo que se debe interrogar más adelante. \"Su mujer\". No podía evitar que mi corazón se hiciera chiquito. Lo amaba. Amaba tanto a Joshua Ryan Hutcherson que casi era insoportable. Se me hacía tan fácil escapar de todos los sentimientos y dejarme morir… pero su amor me mantenía aquí, viva, luchando. No quería decepcionarlo, tampoco quería que me viera de esta manera. Su cercanía me impulsaba a seguir pero al mismo tiempo no soportaba verlo impotente por no hacer nada. Quería tanto la oportunidad de poder tenerlo, quería tanto una vida a su lado. Sabía que quería salir corriendo cada vez que veí como mi estómago devolvía todo, cada vez que cepillaba mi cabello en la mañana y millares de ellos quedaban atrapados en el peine, cada vez que me ayudaba a bañarme y veía que mis huesos empezaban a marcarse. No soportaba eso, no soportaba ponerlo en esa situación. No soportaba hacerlo sufrir, pero él se negaba a dejarme sola. Había prometido que lucharía y cumpliría mi promesa, pero a veces su presencia me abrumaba y quería dejarlo todo ahí y morime de una vez por todas. Asi todo acabaría más rápido. No pude evitar llorar cuando leí el reporte sobre la pérdida de mi bebé. Fue mi culpa, no pude hacer nada, no logré ni hacerme a la idea por completo de que iba a ser madre cuando se esfumó de mis entrañas. Muchos pensarína que la forma en que desperté de la crisis apenas con una leve parálisis de mi pierna, que se solucioanría con la fisioterapia que recibía diariamente, era un milagro. Pude nunca haber despertado, muchas veces me cuestiono si no habría sido eso lo mejor. Leía mi último reporte solo para que mis miedos acrecentaran. No mejoraba. La leucemia no cedía, y aunque no progresaba, estaba un paso de una recaída que podría ser mi fin. ¿Qué sería de Josh? Por ello quería alejarlo, pero era tan egoísta que no soportaba más la distancia y le había permitido entrar. - Gracias. – dije a la enfermera cuando le devolví la ficha. Su mira era de pena, debía conocer mi situción. Traté de sonreírle y ella lo hizo de regreso. Casi al mismo tiempo que se fue, Peter y mis padres llegaron, entusiasmados y con nuevas noticias. - Tenemos algo que proponerte. – dijo mi entusiasmada madre sentándose a mi lado. - Das miedo cuando te pones de esa manera. – su entusiasmo era arrollador. - Peter estuvo investigando… - empezó mi padre con cautela. – Le pidió a la doctora Julianne un resumen de tu caso y lo envió a Institute of Cancer Research. - ¿A Londres? – pregunté sorprendida a mi hermano. - Estudiaron tu caso y dijeron que si aceptas… puedes someterte a un tratamiento experimental. Tienen muy buenas expectativas sobre él, ya lo han probado en otros pacientes con casos parecidos al tuyo y han dado resultados. – Podía entender el entusiasmo de todo mundo. Algo dentro de mí tambien se lleno de esperanza. Quizás pudiera cumplir mi promesa de quedrme con Josh. – Necesito leer toda esa información. Quiero saber de que se trata. - Josh fue por tu computadora, ¿verdad? – Asentí. – Te lo envío al correo y la dirección para que puedas contactarte con ellos. Mi madre empezó a llorar y mi padre le abrazó. En realidad debería estar feliz porque hay una esperanza. - ¿Por qué lloras mamá? Me miró aún con lágrimas. – Temía que no aceptarías, que te dejarías morir. – dijo entercortadamente. Me sentí culpable al llenarles de tanto dolor. Debían sentirse tan impotentes al verme enferma y dejandome ir. – Lucharé mamá. Haré lo posible por estar bien. Todos me abrazaron y sabía que en verdad estaban ilusionados con esta nueva oportunidad. Yo tambien lo estaba, y rezaba porque resultara. Antes de que se vayan tuve que hacerles una petición. – No se lo digan a Josh… por favor. Sus miradas incrédulas me atravesaron. – Es una buena noticia para él. Deberías decirle la buena nueva, necesita algo para que no esté tan… afligido. Sabía que Josh se mostraba fuerte a mi lado y que fuera de aquí podía desmoronarse. Odiaba destruirlo solo por mi egoísmo a retenerlo. – Por favor. Tengo mis razones. Los tres asintieron aunque no aprobaran mi resolución. Mientras trataba de comer mi almuerzo, no tenía hambre, solo lo hacía porque me había comprometido a hacer lo posible para mejorara; Josh llegó. Una sonrisa apareció en mis labios cuando lo vi atravesar el umbral. Su cabellos aún estaba húmedo, había rasurado su barba y lucía una sexy camisa blanca y sus jeans. Totalmente devorable. - Me alegra verte comiendo. – dejó mi computadora en el sofá y se sentó en mi cama. - Tengo que hacerlo aunque mi estomágo se rehusa a mantenerlo dentro. – le sonreí. – No deberías sentarte ahí, las enfermeras te quieren comer vivo. - No te preocupes por eso, no hay nada que uan caja de bombones a cada una no pueda solucionar. - Eso sumado a tu coquetería.. uff, caen a tus pies. - Mientras la chica a quien amo este a mis pies, y ellas me dejen estar cerca, todo se vale. Hice a un lado mi plato y empujé la mesilla para darle mas espacio a Josh que rápidamente se puso a mi lado. – Solo en mí deberías usar tus encantos. Voy a ponerme celosa si sigues por ese camino. Siento que cada vez que te giras ellas aprecian tu trasero. Apenas podía reprimir mi risa. – No deberías verlo de esa manera. Tú sabes que todo este cuerpito caribeño y este delicioso trasero es solo tuyo. Ahora sí no pude evitar reír a carcajadas fuertes. Aun con los labios de Josh sobre los míos apenas podía dejar de hacerlo. – Déjame besuquearte. Me costó mucho dejar de reír para dejarme llevar por la intensidad del beso de Josh. Sus manos se habían filtrado entre las sábanas y bajo mi bata hospitalaria. Sus dedos subían y bajaban por mis muslos, mi cadera y mi abdomen. Sus labios iban de los míos a mi cuello. Enredé mis dedos en su húmedo cabello acercándolo más, si eso era posible. Podía perderme en él y olvidarme del mundo solo con su toque. Este chico despertaba todos mis instintos, invadiéndome de necesidad por él. - Josh…- gemí. Mi voz apenas era un susurro gracias a que mi aliento quedó reprimido en mi garganta. - Te necesito tanto, tanto. – su voz vibraba en mi cuello encendiéndome más. - Yo… yo también. – El fuego que ardía en mi interior me consumía lentamente y sabía que la única formade que no combustione viva era teniendole dentro de mí. Dos golpecitos en la puerta y Josh se apartó de mi. Gemí totalmente frustrada. Estaba tan caliente y necesitada de él. Quien fuera sería mejor que tenga una muy buena razón o realmente iba a estrangularlo. Josh acomodó su camisa, colocándose varios botones que había abierto y se acercó a abrir la puerta. La tía y la mamá de Josh entraron. Se detuvieron un momento para observarnos a ambos que teníamos los rostros sonrojados. - Creo que hicimos bien en tocar. – Dijo Michelle. No pude evitar sonrojarme aún mas. - Ya no hacer con ellos y sus hormonas. – Aseguró Julianne. Michelle se echó a reír. – Si siguen en ese camino no tardaré en ser abuela. Debió ser un comentario que no haga reír, pero sus palabras tocaron uan delicada vena en nuestro corazón al recordar a nuestro bebé. El ambiente se tornó tenso. Michelle se acercó y depositó un beso en mi frente. – Me alegro que estés mejor. - Gracias. – Le había tomado cariño a la madre de Josh, era una persona sincera. - Necesito que me acompañes, Josh. – dijo mirando a su hijo. – Lo siento por robártelo pero este muchacho ha descuidado un montón de obligaciones y Steven me ha pedido que lo haga ponerse al día. Eché una mirada de reproche a Josh quien levanto sus manos en señal de rendición. – Lo había olvidado, pero me pondré al día… no te enojes. Su mirada era cautelosa. – No deberías descuidar tus obligaciones por mí culpa, Josh. Si tienes cosas que hacer, hazlas. A mí no me pasará nada si no estás todo el tiempo a mi lado. No… no quiero que compliques tu vida por mí… - No lo digas. – me reprimió con disgusto. – He sido irresponsable pero no es tu culpa. Soy yo quien no quiero separarme de tu lado. Odio… odio cuando piensas que eres una carga, Alexandra. Estoy aquí a tu lado porque te amo, no porque seas una obligación. - Vamos, chicos. No tienen porque discutir. – Michelle tomó a su hijo del hombro. – Ambos tienen que buscar el equilibrio… no tienes porque ser brusco, Josh. Ella solo no quiere complicar tu vida. - Pues quiero que entienda que quiero estar a su lado, no importa que. Lo hago porque quiero, porque la amo… - dijo enojado mirándome – Te amo. Entiendelo. No eres una carga, no eres una complicación ni una obligación. No me dio tiempo de responder porque salio furioso de la habitación. Michelle solo me dio una mirada de disculpa antes de ir tras él. Quería llorar, en verdad. Sabía que me amaba y no quería que tome mi comentario de esa manera, solo quería que su vida no se viera complicada por mi condición. Es por eso que no quería a Josh a mi lado, lo necesitaba mucho, pero sentía que debía pasar por esto sola, porque simplemente estaba consumiendolo a él como mi enfermedad me consumía a mí mismo. Tomé mi desición. Probablemente Josh no me perdoné por lo que voy a hacer, pero necesitaba hacer esto por mí mismo. - Debes perdonarlo, se que no quisiste provocar eso en él. Todos estamos estresados y preocupados, eso nos pone sensibles. - Lo sé. No me gusta verlo estresado todo el tiempo. Quiero… quiero que este feliz, que siga con su vida, su trabajo, que haga lo que tenga que hacer. Su preocupación por mí no lo deja, no duerme bien, ni come bien. Se que me amá, pero no soporto que siga sacrificandose por mí de esa manera. Diosa sabe que lo amo tanto como para no querer consumir su vida. Pude ver que entendía lo que decía. – ¿Es por eso que no le has dicho que probablemente tendrás que ir a Londres? - Ya es un hecho. Quiero ir. Quiero intentar todo lo que esté en mis manos para seguir. Se lo prometí, pero…. No estoy segura de quererlo ahí. No si su vida va girar en torno a lo que me sucede, se que no es feliz, se que me ama y quiere estar a mi lado, pero no estará completo mientras yo este aquí. - Arreglaré todo para tu partida, no creo que nos tome más de un par de días. Sinceramente no se que aconsejarte. Solo espero que tu desición sea la correcta. Se que tienes razón y se que será una gran sacrificio estar sin Josh. Eso demuestra lo mucho que lo amas, quieres verlo feliz en lugar de atarlo a tu lado. No se como lo vea él. - Quisiera que lo entendiera. Él solo pensaría que no lo amo lo suficiente como para permitirle quedarse conmigo, pero no es eso… - Lo sé. Esperemos que entienda tu sacrificio. - No se lo dirá ¿verdad? Me sonrío tristemente. – Es tu desición. No me corresponde decírle, pero no desaparezcas completamente. Hazle saber lo mucho que lo amas y que lo haces por el bien de ambos. - Si vuelvo… espero que me perdone, porque se que va a dolerle. - El amor lo puede todo, Alexandra. Y ustedes han pasado por mucho como para que algo así los separe. - Eso espero. Lo que iba a hacer sería duro, pero era lo correcto. Necesitaba que Josh siga con su vida y yo necesitaba atravesar esto por mí mismo. Josh era mi roca, pero tenía que salir adelante por mi cuent tal y como él tenía que vivir por sí mismo. Cuando ambos podamos vivir por nosotros mismo, podremos vivir por alguien más. No vi a Josh en todo el día y tampoco vino en la noche a quedarse conmigo. Debía aún estar enfadado. La noche se hizo larga, me había acostumbrado tanto a dormir envuelta en sus brazos. Al siguiente día el único Hutcherson que llegó fue Connor. Me alegraba tanto verlo, y tener con quien conversar. Me moría por preguntarle por Josh, pero una parte de mí no quería saber de él, quería que él viniera a mi lado. - Josh se fue a Los Ángeles. – Connor soltó despues de un rato. Debió notar mi indesición. - Oh… - fue lo único que pude responder. - Le ofrecieron un nuevo papel. Uno importante y… él lo iba a rechazar porque quería quedarse a tu lado. A mi corazón lo invadió una oleada fría. – No me lo dijo. - Creo que no quería que te sintieras culpable por rechazar el papel. Pero ayer lo llamaron y le insistieron para que acuda a la audición. - Me alegra que audicionara. Lo último que quiero es que deje de hacer lo que le gusta por mí. – Era verdad, pero dolía que no pudiera confiar en mí lo suficiente para decirme lo que le sucedía. - No estes triste pequeña. - Mejor hablemos sobre ti. Estoy harta de todos preocupados por mí, nunca he sido buena siendo el centro de atención. – Traté de sonar animada. Hablamos por horas sobre su relación. Al parecer Connor era un enamorado empedernido. Pasaba de chica a otra y de todas creía que eran el amor de su vida. Pase 2 días más sin Josh, al mismo tiempo que arreglaba todo para mi partida. Empecé a escribir una carta para el chico que amaba. El día anterior a mi partida, la última noche en este hospital me eché a llorar. Me sentía tan sola y extrañaba tanto a Josh. No quería irme, sobretodo no quería irme sin verlo una última vez y decirle lo mucho que lo amo. Debí quedarme dormida, y debí estar soñando que esta otra vez en sus brazos. Sentía que mi corazón amoldaba al ritmo del suyo. Mi mano se aferraba a su pecho no queriendo que se vaya de nuevo. - Soy un tonto. – lo escuché decir. – Lo siento tanto. Abrí mis ojos lentamente para encontrarme con unos bellos ojos atormentados. – Lo siento también. - No debí reaccionar de esa manera, solo no soporto que pienses que lo que hago por ti es por algo diferente a lo mucho que te amo. - Se que me amas, y se que esto es duro. – susurré mirando a sus ojos. – No sabes lo que daría por evitarte estas preocupaciones. Quiero que seas feliz y que tu vida no sea tan complicada. Quiero que hagas lo que te gusta y no lo pospongas por mí. - No es un sacrificio, no tengo vida sin ti. – Sus palabras aunque me hacían amarlo más, me confirmaban que estaba haciendo lo correcto. - Te amo, Josh. No olvides nunca. – Mis manos rodeaban su cuello jugando con los mechones de su cabello. – Todo lo que haga, todo.. será porque pienso en ti y porque quiero que seas feliz. Nunca olvides eso, nunca olvides que eres el único dueño de mi corazón, de mi mente y de mi alma. Sus labios rozaron los míos. – Me alegra escucharlo, pero siento como si fuera una despedida. Puse mis labios sobre los suyos para evitar tener que responder. Estuvimos un momento más saboreando nuestra cercanía para luego sumirnos en el sueño en los brazos del otro. No sabía cuando tendría este privilegio neuvamente, quizas nunca más disfrute de la sensación de los brazos de Josh, asi que traté de guardar cada momento en mi mente. El amanecer llegó muy rápido. No quería tener que separarme de sus brazos pero sabía que en cualquier momento saldría por esa puerta y me daría el último beso en quizá, si corría con suerte, en mucho tiempo. - Hola. – Dijo cuando abrió sus ojos. - Hola. – Respondí a su sonrisa. - Me alegra que estemos bien. No sabes lo mal que me siento por haberme ido. - Todo está olvidado. - Será mejor que me vaya. Tengo que ir a cambiarme antes de ir a firmar unos papeles en la fundación. – Le había dado todos los derechos para que él tome las desiciones por ambos. Se acercó para darme un beso en los labios y luego en la frente. – Nos vemos luego, pequeña. Volveré lo más pronto posible. Me aferré a su mano antes de que se aleje lo suficiente. Me miró interrogativo. - ¿Sabes que te amo, verdad? Mi pregunta debio sorprenderlo, pero no dudó en contestarme. – Lo sé. Me amas tanto como yo a ti. - Recuerdalo siempre ¿Vale? - Vale. – Aunque él no sabía de que iba toda esta declaración, yo me sentía ams tranquila sabiendo que hasta el último momento él sabía mis sentimientos. Le di un último beso, lento, dulce. Saboreé cada instantes porque sería el que lleve en mis recuerdos. No duró lo que hubiera querido, pero sería suficiente para recordarnos a ambos lo mucho que necesitabamos el uno del otro. - Te amo. - Te amo. Fueron nuestras palabras de despedida. Dolía mi corazón dejarlo ir. Ayudaron a prepararme para mi traslado. Llegaría justo para mi vuelo sin tener que esperar por el despegue. Antes de dejar mi habitación, deje sobre mi almohada un carta para él. Julianne me proemtió asegurarse que él la leyera. Ahí le pediría perdon por dejarlo a un lado, y le explicaba mis razones. En verdad esperaba que me perdonara y tener la oportunidad de volver a su lado. Ahora era mi turno para luchar por mi vida, y poder darle ese regalo a Josh. Una vida plena sin preocupaciones. Solo esperaba la oportunidad de vivir. Solo esperaba que Josh me quiera a su lado, después de todo. O_O_O+_O¨+ Hoola :) Me extrañaron? bueno q tal el nuevo capítulo.. creo q un poco confuso verdad... acabo de terminar el próximo aunque no estoy conforme tendré toda la semana para mejorarlo, pero no quería hacerles esperar. Gracias x sus reviews.. sobretodo.. gracias BLARALU x publicar la historia y tus comentarios.. en verdad me gusta tu opinión y espero q también tengas suerte en tus estudios. buscaré mas tiempo par terminar la historia, sobretodo porque quiero que los últimos capítulos sean como espero aunque aun no estoy segura de como terminar así que acepto sugerencias. :) Nos vemos luego.. espero sus comentarios sobre q creen q sucederá :) AVANCE: Mis decisiones desde que nos conocimos solo nos han conducido por un camino de tristeza. Mira donde terminé yo, echándome a morir porque no tenía motivos, porque no quería enfrentarme a todo lo que había causado. Recuerdo que un día me di cuenta que le tenía mas miedo a mis sentimientos que a la misma muerte. Y sigue siendo así Josh, tengo tanto miedo a lo que sentimos el uno por el otro, tengo miedo por ti, porque se que ambos tenemos el poder de destruir al otro.[Chapter 111] Capítulo 111 Estaba realmente enfadado, sentía que ella estaba llena de pesimismo, de culpa, de sentimientos malos y no podía hacer nada para cambiarlo. Sentía que me dejaba fuera, sentía que le estorbaba tenerme todo tiempo a su alrededor. Me sentía frustrado por verla de esa manera, inutil al poder hacer nada para que ella este bien. No podía dejar de pesar de que se estaba muriendo y no podía hacer nada para evitarlo. Solo cuando la tenía cerca podía llenarme de tranquilidad, como si de alguna manera aferrarme a ella aseguraba su vida. Mi vida no está complicada por quedarme a su lado, mi vida se complicaba cuando ella pensaba que lo que hacía era un sacrificio. Estaba tan enfadado, era como si todas mis preocupaciones y frustraciones que habían estado embotelladas habían decido escapar de un solo golpe. No quería desquitarme más con ella así que decidí alejarme. La extrañaba, mucho. Pero necesitaba tiempo para mí, tiempo para reformular mi vida, tiempo para saber que voy a hacer, como voy a lograr que la chica por quien vivo no muera. Había recibido una de las tantas llamadas para mis nuevos proyectos. Steven estaba tan frustrado antes mis negaciones. – Necesitas por lo menos considerarlo, Josh. Es tu gran oportunidad, es un papel importantes y si lo haces bien, como siempre, te doy una año para que protagonices y estes de camino a un Oscar. Practicamente me dijeron que el papel es tuyo pero tienes que cumplir con el protocolo y audicionar. - Steven… - No lo digas. Sé que tu novia… quieres estar a su lado, pero piensa en que algún momento esto pasará y no querrás encontrarte con tu carrera terminada. Solo audiciona, si aseguras el papel luego puedes ver si lo rechazas o no, pero todos sabrán que ese papel era tuyo. Tenía razón, no podía continuar dejando mi vida en \"STOP\" y maldita sea si sabía que Alex tampoco quería que eso sucediera. Acepté viajar para la audición. Quizás unos días lejos me ayudarían a reflexionar. Me rompía dejarle sin decirle pero tampoco estaba preparado para enfrentarla sin un plan. Audicioné y conseguí el papel. Me dieron tiempo para decidir si quería llevar acabo el proyecto pero estos días me dieron lo necesario para reformularme. Había sido un tonto, había sido explosivo y me apresuré al tomar mis desiciones. Solo era mi frutración quien me llevo a dejarle por unos días. Ella tenía razón, si yo estuviera en su lugar querría exactamente lo mismo. No soportaría que su vida se vuelva un desafío solo por mi condición. Pero podía hacerlo funcionar, estaba tan seguro de que podía arreglar todo. Si estaba con ella podía todo. Juntos buscaremos la solución, una mejor forma de adaptarnos para que la cosas sean mas llevaderas. Aún tenemos el mayor de los problemas, no podemos dejar nuestras vidas porque estamos admitiendo la derrota, estamos dejando que la sombra de la muerte nos invada. Volví lo más rápido posible en su busca. Era muy tarde cuando llegué a su habitación y la encontré dormida. No pude evitar acurrucarme a su lado, ella inmediatamente se aferró a mi. - Soy un tonto. – Lo era, y nos había causado daño. – Lo siento tanto. No me importaba que no me escuchará, se lo diría mil veces porque es lo mínimo que podía hacer. Pedir perdón. Abrió sus ojos lentamente, fijando su mirada en mí. – Lo siento también. Sabía que mi reacción tambien debó llevarle a plantearse lo que había hehco mal. - No debí reaccionar de esa manera, solo no soporto que pienses que lo que hago por ti es por algo diferente a lo mucho que te amo. - Se que me amas, y se que esto es duro. – No era duro amarla, era dura nuestra situación. – No sabes lo que daría por evitarte estas preocupaciones. Quiero que seas feliz y que tu vida no sea tan complicada. Quiero que hagas lo que te gusta y no lo pospongas por mí. - No es un sacrificio, no tengo vida sin ti. – Era exactamente lo que sentía. Podía seguir actuando, podía salir y divertirme pero unca estaba completo si ella no era parte de mi vida. - Te amo, Josh. No olvides nunca. Todo lo que haga, todo.. será porque pienso en ti y porque quiero que seas feliz. Nunca olvides eso, nunca olvides que eres el único dueño de mi corazón, de mi mente y de mi alma. Me gustaba escuchar esas palabras. Que la persona que amas te diga que te corrresponde es uno de los mejores sonidos que podrías escuchar. Aunque no podía quitarme la sensación de que sus palabras tenía un tono triste. – Me alegra escucharlo, pero siento como si fuera una despedida. No respondió a mi afirmación pero un momento despues estabamos besandonos y disfrutando nuestro contacto, para luego sumiernos en la calidez de nuestra cercanía. Dormir a su lado era completamente un lujo que no quería volver a perder. Ya al amanecer lo primero que vi al abrir mis ojos fue su mirada. No identificaba lo que había en ella porque parecía estar llena de sentimeintos contradictorios. - Hola. - Hola. – Respondió con una sonrisa. - Me alegra que estemos bien. No sabes lo mal que me siento por haberme ido. – Quería que lo supiera, que reconocía y admitía mi error completamente. - Todo está olvidado. – Me alegraba que fuera así y que nuevmente estuvieramos bien. Inmediatamente empezaría a organizar de mejor manera nuestras vidas. - Será mejor que me vaya. Tengo que ir a cambiarme antes de ir a firmar unos papeles en la fundación. – Sabía que eso le alegraría, saber que todo estaba en marcha y como debiera ser. – Nos vemos luego, pequeña. Volveré lo más pronto posible. Su mano atrapo la mía evitando que me fuera. Sus ojos estaban llenos de determinación. - ¿Sabes que te amo, verdad? Me sorprendí por su afirmación y mucho más por la necesidad que vi en ella de saber la respuesta. – Lo sé. Me amas tanto como yo a ti. - Recuerdalo siempre ¿Vale? No sabía si debía indagar aún mas en lo que pasaba por su mente. Decidí dejarlo pasar. – Vale. Nos besamos. Fue… perfecto, pero no podía quitarme la sensación de que algo iba relamente mal. - Te amo. – me despedí. - Te amo. – Respondió inmediatamente. Miré a sus ojos fijamente antes de irme. Su mirada era mía, su corazón era mío. No sabría que hacer si la perdía. Pase el día de un lado para el otro, definitvamente necesitaría mas de 24 horas para solucionar todo lo que estaba pendiente sobretodo con respecto a la fundación. Los trámites eran la especialidad de mi chica por lo tanto la encargada, ahora me siento mal por haberle dejado todo eso a su cargo. Luego 2 horas de espera en el centro de registro de propiedad decidí que por hoy no haría nada más. Necesitaba ver a mi chica, estar con ella, luchar a su lado. Había ignoradado el mal presentimiento en mi pecho durante todo el día, pero mientras más me acercaba al hospital, aquel iba en aumento. Ya por el pasillo que conducía a su habitación empecé a correr, escuché mi nombre de los labios de mi tía Julianne llamarme pero obvié y seguí mi camino. Me detuvé en seco al encontrarme con una habitación vacía. Hubiera pensado que no estaría allí porque pudieron llevarle para algún exámen, terapia, cualquier cosa, pero había algo diferente. No estaban sus fotos ni las flores que compro para ella todos los días, solo estaba… vacía. - Josh… - Mi tía me había alcanzado. La miré supe que la habitación vacía tenía un significado que no me iba a gustar. Mi corazón empezó a latir rapidamente y un miedo se instauró en mi cuerpo. No pudo pasarle nada ¿verdad? Esta mañana estaba bien, no podía ponerse mal de un momento a otro. - ¿Está… está..? - Esta bien. – aseguró. – Esperemos que pronto este mejor. Empezaba a desesperarme. Quería explicaciones, sentía que me estaba perdiendo en un montón de ira, furia y especialmente me sentía traicionado. Solo entendía que ella se había ido y no dudó ni un momento en dejarme atrás. - No entiendo. – no lo hacía, ella me amaba, yo lo hacía, por dejarme sin más. - Dejo algo para ti. - Hizo un gesto hacia la cama donde yacía una sobre blanco que no había notado antes. Me acerqué a tomarla. Abrí la carta sentándome en aquella cama donde había compartido la seguridad de nuestra cercanía las últimas noches. Y a pesar de eso pudo dejarme sin un poco de remordimiento. - Te dejaré solo… no la juzgues, ella en verdad te ama.- Cerró la puerta dejándome mi espacio. ¿cómo se suponía que continuara mi vida sin ella? Se lo había dicho miles de veces, yo no tenía vida sin ella, pero no dudo en dejarme sabiendo que tendría que reformular mi vida, que buscar soluciones, sabiendo que había roto mi corazón y destrozado mi alma al dejarme atrás. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O Se que debes estarme odiando estos momentos y no sabes lo mucho que me duele ello. Se que debes preguntarte como pude hacerte eso, dejarte sin mirar atrás, pero creeme cuando te digo que me destrozó irme. Te amo, Josh. Recuerda eso, recuerda que eres la razón por la que sigo aquí. No dudo de tu amor, ni por un segundo, hemos pasado por tanto como para que yo aún tengas dudas de tus sentimientos. No es por eso que me fui. No me fui por que no te ame, ni por que piense que tú no la hagas. Me fui porque nos amamos demasiado. ¿Cómo puede tener sentido eso? Lo tiene, Josh. Mis decisiones desde que nos conocimos solo nos han conducido por un camino de tristeza. Mira donde terminé yo, echándome a morir porque no tenía motivos, porque no quería enfrentarme a todo lo que había causado. Recuerdo que un día me di cuenta que le tenía mas miedo a mis sentimientos que a la misma muerte. Y sigue siendo así Josh, tengo tanto miedo a lo que sentimos el uno por el otro, tengo miedo por ti, porque se que ambos tenemos el poder de destruir al otro. Josh… si algo te pasará sería mi fin y se que lo mismo va para ti. Mereces a una persona que pueda vivir por si misma, que pueda reponerse antes las dificultades y luchar por lo que quiere. Prentendo ser esa persona Josh. Pretendo curarme, pretendo tener mi vida a tu lado, pero necesito hacerlo por mí misma sin la preocupación de estar destruyendo tu vida. La persona que merezca el placer de compartir su vida con la tuya será quien este a tu lado para ayudarte a cumplir tus metas. Amas actuar, amas el baloncesto, amas salir con tus amigos, amas colaborar, amas ser solidario, amas muchas cosas y no has hecho nada de ello por volcar tu vida entorno a la mía. Lo normal sería que ambos volcaramos nuestras vidas al del otro sin tener que detenerlas porque uno de los dos muere. Lo que trato de decir es que estoy detruyendo tu vida, no eres feliz, Josh, no puedes serlo si solo te dedicas a darme fuerza para que siga y dejas tu vida y todo lo que amas a un lado. No te niego que yo haría lo mismo, pero no quiere decir que este bien. Quiero que tengas de vuelta todo lo que has dejado por mí, quiero que seas el chico que disfruta de cada uno de sus días haciendo lo que ama. Quiero ese chico feliz, no al chico preocupado, estresado y desesperado que ha estado a mi lado estos días. No me busques, Josh. Si me amas tendrás que dejarme ir, necesito encontrarme a mí misma, reconciliarme con lo que soy porque siento que no merezco lo que tu me das. Siento que despues de todas las cosas malas que hice no merezco tu amor. Ni yo entiendo como puedes perdonarme y seguir jurando tu amor por mí despues de todo. Pero quiero, Josh. Quiero lo que me ofreces, quiero que me ames y quieras estar a mi lado. Necesito merecerte. Recuerdo las palabras de Darío cuando me estaba echando a morir. Me dijo que si no creía merecerte luche por cambiar eso, que te demuestre que puedo vivir por ti, que puedo seguir… pretendo hacer eso. Quiero salir adelante, quiero poder ponerme de pie por mí misma y cuando lo haga volveré a ti. Si muero quiero que sepas que te amé hasta el último momento, y si es posible, despues de muerta te amaré aún mas y solo espero que encuentras la felicidad. Pero si te soy sincera no quiero morir y perderme el privilegio de tener cada segundo de mi vida a tu lado. Si vivo prometo volver por ti, prometo llamar a tu puerta y decir que estoy lista para entregarme a tus brazos. Solo espero que llegues a entenderme y que para es momento aún me quieras a tu lado. No te estoy pidiendo que me esperes porque eso sería injusto de mi parte. Solo te digo lo que quisiera si vivieramos en mundo en que los deseos se cumplen. La idea de todo esto es que sigas con tu vida y si en el camino encuetras a alguien a quien amar, pues hazlo, Josh. Amalá como solo tu lo haces, entregandote en cuerpo y alma. Te prometo no interferir y ser feliz porque tú lo eres. Eres lo que más amo en esta vida, Joshua. Pienso en ti con cada latido de mi corazón, simplemente porque ya no es mío. Te pertenece y me gusta que así sea porque en mejores manos no podría estar. Hasta pronto, mi amor. Solo recuerda que mi único deseo es poder tenerte. No me odies, no lo soportaría, pero tampoco te odiaría si lo haces. Se feliz, Josh. Mi corazón y mi alma siempre estarán contigo. 3 Alex. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O \"Te extraño cada día más. Quiero tanto envolverte en mis brazos, besarte decirte lo mucho que te amo y nunca más dejarte ir. Entiendo, Alex. Entiendo lo que esperas de ambos, solo anhelo por el momento en que nos volvamos a encontrar. (I won´t give up – Jason Mraz: watch?v=E5Auah8HYNM&list;=UUXb5dwR1WcQ-OxS10J0PaMA ) O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O \"Te amo, Josh. Gracias por no odiarme, no sabría como soportarlo. Yo seré todo lo que quieres… (I will be – Avril Lavigne: watch?v=3j9G0yzrGFY ) O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - ¿Lo extrañas? – preguntó mi mamá mientras guardaba mi ropa limpia. - Demasiado. A veces quiero llamarlo y decirle que venga por mí. – Conteste mirando a mi celular y pensando exactamente en hacer eso. - Deberías hacerlo, ya puedes recibir visitas. Te ayudará verlo. Había estado sometida a un tratamiento muy dificil. Químicos muy potentes que me había dejado con mis defensas por los suelos. Había estado aíslada del mundo por casi 3 meses. Apenas podía ver a mi madre a traves de un cristal y hablar con ella mediante un intercomunicador. Ahora mi nueva terapia era menos invasiva y tenía mi propia habitación, no muy diferente a la de un hotel, y mi madre podía quedarse conmigo. - No me siento lista, mamá. - Entiendo. - Tal vez cuando este completamente sana. - Peter me dijo que pregunta por ti a diario. Está trabajando en su nueva película, se ha hecho cargo de todo en la fundación pero no deja de pensar en ti. Creo que merece una llamada, asi sea para decirle que estás bien. - Tal vez lo haga. O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O – O - Te conozco, Josh. Se que no estás bien aunque quieras aparentar lo contrario. - No aparento nada, Clau. Todo mundo sabe lo mal que me siento por…- Hasta decir su nombre dolía. Cada vez que la nombraba tenía la esperanza que aparecierá frente a mí solo para desilusionarme cuando nada sucedía. - Lo sé. Lo siento, solo… extraño al viejo, Josh, que a pesar de no tener a su chica a su lado no se daba por vencido. - Es diferente. – suspiré´resigando. – Antes tenía que pelear y sabía con quien me enfrentaba. Ahora… no lo sé. De lo único que estoy enterado es que sigue viva. Son 6 meses que no se nada de ella mas que algún mensaje, alguna canción. Quiero oír su voz, quiero que me diga que aún me ama y que no ha encontrado a nadie que me reemplace. Claudia empezó a reírse. – No puedo creerlo. A pesar de todo, aun dudas de su amor. ¿celos? - Lo sé. Está mal, pero quiero que regrese y a veces pienso que ese es el motivo porque no vuelve. Una llamada. Es todo lo que necesito. - Todo a su tiempo, amigo. Ella te ama, no olvides eso. Aunque mi corazón lo sabía, mi mente divaga entre un millón de posibilidades pesimistas. Ya llegada la noche, en mi cama, me disponía a tratar de fugarme a ese mundo de sueños donde estábamos juntos. Haría lo posible porque sucediera pero mi impaciencia me hacía entrar en desesperación. Abrazaba mi almohada tratando de engañar a mi cuerpo que era ella a quien tenía entre mis brazos. Ya entre la bruma de mis sueños escuché el pitido de mi celular. Estiré mi mano para tomarlo y lo llevé a mi oído. Debía ser algo realmente importante para no enojarme con quien me había despertado. - Hola. - Hola, Josh. – su voz tímida despejó totalmente mi sueño o simplemente estaba en uno donde podía volver a escucharla claramente. - Alex. O+-+O+-+O+-+O+-+O+-+O+-+O+-+O Hooola :) me he perdido pero en verdad q no he podido. Pasé toda la semana enferma, con mucha fiebre y 2 días internada, ahora tengo que igualarme a mis clases e ir a mis turnos perdidos.y encima de todo tengo q terminar mi protocolo de tesis :( Creanme q no tengo idea de como terminar, tengo muchas ideas sueltas pero llegue a un punto en q no se como escribirlo... solo diré q el epílogo será largo con episodios de diferentes fechas. Me ayudaría mucho saber q es lo q uds esperan. Les pido paciencia por lo menos estas 2 próximas semanas en las q tengo que igualarme con mis estudios :) Nos leemos pronto. MILET AVANCE: - El problema Alexandra es que en verdad no sabes que es lo mejor para mí. Solo asumes lo que tu conciencia cree que es correcto. Yo reconocí mi error, tenías razon sobre lo mal que llevaba mi vida mientras lidiaba contigo y lo estaba solucionando, ahora espero que reconozcas tu error al dejarme atrás. Todo iría mejor si estuvieramos juntos.[Chapter 112] Capítulo 112 - Me alegra oírte, Josh. – la voz de ambos era incrédula y en la de él resaltaba la sorpresa. - Esa debería ser mi línea. No… no puedo creer que me llamarás. – sonaba extasiado. – No puedo creer que me dejarás. - Dijiste que entendías porque lo hice. - Lo entiendo, comprendo las razones en las que basas tu teoría sobre que estaré mejor si me dejas atrás. Lo entiendo, eso no quiere decir que este de acuerdo. - No… - Déjame terminar. – me interrumpió. – Necesito que escuches antes de que desaparezcas. Alex, me equivoqué, se que no manejé bien las cosas y si me pongo en tu lugar se que querría exactamente lo mismo. Mi forma de depender de ti y tu situación era como aceptar la derrota, estábamos dejando que nos consumiera pero me di cuenta de mi error, lo estaba intentado, Alex. Te juro que quería cambiar las cosas, ser quien necesitabas… no debiste irte. Te extraño más que nada, no puedo dejar de pensar en ti ni por un segundo, me duele en cada respiro, me duele cada noche cuando no te siento a mi lado. ¿Sabes lo horrible que han sido estos meses para mí? ¿Tienes idea lo mucho que quería buscarte? Te lo dije una vez: no puedo \"continuar\" o \"avanzar\" más sin ti de lo que podría si la mitad de mi cuerpo fuera cortado. Alex, nos amamos, no le temas a eso. No vamos a destruirnos el uno al otro por estar juntos, pero si lo harmos si nos mantenemos alejados. - Lo comprendo ahora. – Era verdad. Sabía que irme lejos de él no había estado bien, porque no lo había hecho por las razones correctas. Lo había echo por mí, por que me sentía culpable. – Te extraño, tambien. No imaginas lo dificil que ha sido para mi estar lejos, sabiendo que podrías venir a mi con un llamado… - ¿Por qué no lo hiciste? ¿Por qué dejarme en lejos si tanto me extrañas? – escucha el dolor en sus palabras. - Lo necesitaba, Josh. Necesitaba reconciliarme conmigo mismo para poder hacerlo con mis sentimientos hacia ti. Duele, Josh. Me duele tanto todo lo que ha sucedido que a veces siento que ya no puedo más… - Lo prometiste...- susurró. – Prometiste luchar. - Lo estoy haciendo. Primero luchaba por ti, porque me lo pediste pero conprendí en algún momento que necesitaba hacerlo por mí también. Recuerdas que mi mayor miedo era darme por vencida sin luchar lo suficiente y estaba haciendo eso exactamente: me estaba fallando a mí mismo. Luego de eso debía llegar a merecerte, a reconciliarme conmigo mismo y con el mundo. – Repetía las palabras que he querido que entendiera desde un inicio. - ¿Lo lograste? – la esperanza en su voz hacía que mi corazón duela. Me sentía culpable. - Estoy trabajando en ello. Por un momento el silencio nos embargó. - ¿Cómo estás? - Mejor. Soy optimista al respecto. – Mi voz tenía un leve tinte de frustración. - ¿Por qué tardaste tanto en llamar? ¿Sabes cuan desesperado estaba? - Lo he querido hacer desde que me fui. Llamarte. Pero no me sentía lista. Hace un par de meses lo iba a hacer y… algo salió mal. – No puedo evitar estremecerme recordando lo muy al borde de morir que tuve por una gran recaída. – Solor quería serla primera en decirte… Feliz Cumpleaños. - Lo había olvidado. Es como si el tiempo fuera distinto… pareciera que fuera más lento, que cada segundo es interminable al no tenerte; pero cuando miro hacia atrás parece haber pasado demasiado deprisa. - Siento lo mismo. Todo es tan dificil sin ti. Te amo tanto, vivo solo por ello, vivo solo por la esperanza de que pronto cada cosa estará en su lugar y no dejo de decirme que todo sería más facil para mí si tu estas a mi lado… pero es mi propio egoísmo lo que nos ha hecho daño durante todo este tiempo. Debo pensar en que es mejor para ti. - El problema Alexandra es que en verdad no sabes que es lo mejor para mí. Solo asumes lo que tu conciencia cree que es correcto. Yo reconocí mi error, tenías razon sobre lo mal que llevaba mi vida mientras lidiaba contigo y lo estaba solucionando, ahora espero que reconozcas tu error al dejarme atrás. Todo iría mejor si estuvieramos juntos. - No me arrepiento, Josh. Hice lo que creí mejor, y algo me dice que te tienes de vuelta tu vida. Estás trabajando, nuevos proyectos, nuevos amigos… - ¡PERO TU NO ESTÁS A MI LADO! – gritó. – Nada tiene sentido, no puedo celebrar mis logros porque no te tengo, no puedo alegrarme de salir con mis amigos porque no tengo a mi chica de quien presumir; no puedo bailar con nadie porque mis manos solo anhelan el contacto con tu piel… mi vida, es vacía sin ti. Tengo que preguntarme porque respiro cada mañana, porque sigo aquí si no tengo una razón para sentirme completo… y ahí recuerdo que tú estás en algun lado, que me amas aunque no entienda tu forma de hacerlo… ya no puedo seguir así, Alex. Necesitas decidir si me quieres o no a tu lado, en estos momentos, porque si seguimos así por mucho amor que nos tengamos vamos a terminar haciéndonos mas daño del que nos hemos hecho. - No quiero hacerte daño, Josh. Nunca… - Dime lo que quieres, Alexandra. Dime que me necesitas y tomaré un avión inmediatamente… - la esperanza de su voz me decía que mi decisión marcaría el destino de nuestra relación. Pensé bien en mi respuesta, en lo bueno y malo que implicaba tener a Josh a mi lado estos momentos. Él tomó mi silencio como una respuesta. – Eso es todo, no puedo hacer nada si no me quieres a tu lado. - Josh… - Que tengas una vida feliz. – No podía creer que todo se estaba acabando y no podía hacer nada. Tenía tantas cosas que decir, tenía tanto que demostrar solo que aún no me sentía lista. – Feliz Cumpleaños, Josh. – mi voz se quebraba al tratar de retener el sollozo que aplastaba mi garganta. - Gracias, Alexandra. Varios pitidos a través del teléfono resonaron por un momento invadiendo mi cerebro y golpeando mi cráneo. Mi cuerpo se había quedado rígido y aún tenía el teléfono en mi oreja. No entendía nada, no entendía como podían dañarse las cosas de un momento a otro y siempre terminar siendo yo la culpable. Tal vez sería mejor así. Para él… Para mí… Quizás definitivamente no somos el uno para el otro. Quizás cada uno lucha contracorriente y es por eso que todo es tan complicado. Mis siguientes días fueron tan monótonos como pudieran ser. Me despertaba cuando tenía que iniciar mi tratamiento. Soportaba por horas la administración dolorosa de medicamentos. No había llorado en lo que iba del tratamiento pero esta vez permití dejarme ir en medio del dolor, era lo único que me sentía viva, porque solo era un cuerpo que respiraba porque era automático, comia porque me lo ponían en frente y seguí porque era lo que debía hacer. El dolor hacía que los pensamientos en mi mente se centrara, agruparan y por lo tanto, me atormentaban. Mi corazón dolía, pueden decir que solo es un músculo que reacciona a las variaciones de mi sistema nervioso simpático y para simpático pero en estos momentos puede asegurar lo muy roto que está, lo muy débil que late. Siento que lo llama. Mi corazón lo llama. Mi alma lo quiere de regreso. Mi cuerpo lo quiere a su lado. Y ese dolor era el que sentía todos los días, se despertaba conmigo en las mañana y me abraza en las noches para mecerme mientras dormía. Quería cambiara las cosas…. Quería regresar el tiempo y saber que hacer para no terminar de esta manera. Lamentablemente no vivimos en un mundo donde podemos depender de los deseos. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O Cada día era casi insoportable. Dolía. Pero no tenía las fuerzas para cambiarlo. Fui radical pero ese momento estuve dolido y furioso. Ahora siento que cada respiración, cada latido, duele. Porque ahora parece definitivo. Creía que si le ponía entre la espada y la pared ella accedería. No creí que me saldría el tiro por la culata. Ahora a cada momento quería pedirle perdón, pero algo en mí lo evitaba. Quizás era el orgullo. El orgullo no es un buen consejero. Y sabiendo eso no la he buscado… solo he dejado que pase el tiempo. He logrado que mi corazón se duerma y he llegado a fingir tan bien que estoy de la mejor manera que yo mismo termino creyendomelo. Soy un excelente actor. Pero mientras el sueño me acoge en sus brazos, solo pronunción un nombre. De la persona que amo y nunca dejaré de amar. Alex. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-** 1 AÑO DESPUES**O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-* Me detuve en la entrada para observar mejor aquel edificio. Me demoré haciendo todo el recorrido de arriba abajo llenandome de recuerdos. Por un momento temo entrar, temo que la fuerza con la que los recuerdos vuelvan a mí puedan derrumbarme. Temo que la nostalgia me vuelva a hundir en aquel hoyo del que casi no logro salir. Pensr que todo comenzo en este lugar… Nuestra historia ha sido complicada, pareciera que todo comenzó hace un millón de años en lugar de apenas 7. Con suavidad recorró la estancia, fijándome en cada detalle. Todo se ve igual, como si el tiempo no lo hubiera afectado de la manera en las que nos ha hecho a los demás. Pulso el botón del ascensor e inmediatamente las puertas se abren. Los recuerdos empiezan a llegar, en verdad trato de mantener la compostura. El ascensor sube y pronto llegará al último piso. Debí hacer caso a Peter y dejar que él venga. Algo en mí me aseguró que nada pasaría y no quería dejar todo el trabajo a mi hermano que tendría que buscar tiempo para fijarse en cada detalle, despues de todo, mi fundación era quien iba a adquirir el edificio para su uso. Las puertas se abrieron dándome paso al vestíbulo donde había aprendido a bailar con él. Solo faltó echar una mirada, mirar el piso alfombrado y los espejos en las paredes para que las lágrimas picaran en mis ojos. Fue una muy mala idea venir aquí. Tomé una bocanada de aire para evitar sollozar y di media vuelta en busca de las escaleras. Tendría que llamar a Peter para que me disculpe con el contratista y asignar una nueva cita, en la que yo este más preparada para enfrentar la lluvia de recuerdos que me trae este lugar. Avanzaba lo más rápido que me permitían los tacones y escalones mientras mi vista se nublaba por las lágrimas. Estaba llegando a la segunda planta lista para girar en la esquina y continuar bajando cuando choqué con un muro sólido pero extrañamente suave Un segundo después me precipitaba contra la pared para posiblemente rebotar contra ella y estrellarme luego en el suelo. Realmente no me importaba. Tal vez ese dolor físico ayude a distraerme del dolor de mi alma. Pero no sentí dolor, lo contrario, su aroma invadió mis sentidos y la calidez de sus brazos a mi alrededor me llevaron a creer que posiblemente estaba inconsciente y mi subconsciente me llevaba a un mundo de fantasía. Empecé a sollozar en su pecho, mientras sus manos acariciaban mi cabellos. Mis dedos se aferraron a su camisa, temiendo que pronto llegaría a mi la realidad y no podría sentirme completa de nuevo. - Lo siento…- susurraba al Josh de mis sueños. Con cuidado una mano viajó a mi mentón y lo levantó para encontrarme con sus ojos. Había dolor en ellos pero tambien había amor. Amor. Quizás no lo había perdido como había pensado. Por lo menos mi sobconsciente no se había hecho a la idea de esa pérdida. - Aún te amo, Alexandra. Un segundo despues sus labios estaban sobre los míos trayendo a la vida a cada célula de mi cuerpo, despertando mi corazón de su letargo, haciendo que mi alma regrese a mi cuerpo, quitándome la razón y la conciencia de mi miseria para perderme en él. - Josh… - sollocé sobre sus labios. Una sonrisa se formó en los suyos. - Bienvenida, mi amor. - hooola :) me extrañaron? les diré que yo si... he estado enferma y llena de pruebas y trabajos.. les cuento que estoy escribiendo el último capítulo. me siento tan rara terminando la historia que en verdad siento que lo que he escrito no es suficiente para terminar :( Tendrán que ser un poquito mas pacientes ya que quisiera tener listo los primero caps de mi proxima historia. Gracias x sus comentarios y espero ansiosa por leer sus opiniones, sobretodo lo que esperanpara el final.. aun estoy trabajando en él :P Nos leemos pronto :) MILET AVANCE: - Tú no querías que te esperara… - Se lo que dije, pero no era lo que en verdad quería. Lo sabes, Josh. Sabes que te amo, sabes que eres el único. – Sus ojos aún tenían lágrimas y por un momento su mirada se detuvo en mis ojos llenándose de miedo. – Tú…¿Tienes a alguien?[Chapter 113] Capítulo 113 Me sentía extraño estar de nuevo en aquel sitio. Era como regresar en el tiempo porque a este lugar sin duda no había cambiado nada. La fundación iba a adquirir precisamente este edificio. Que irónica coincidencia. Entré lentamente al ya conocido recibidor. Presioné el botón de llamado del ascensor. El panel superior indicaba que se encontraba en el último piso y aún no descendía. Decidí tener paciencia. Luego de un momento recordé que no soy para nada paciente y mucho más cuando había algo que me decía que corra, que este alerta. Algo dentro de mí hacía que mi corazón se acelerara… era como si estuviera ansioso, a la expectativa por algo. Empecé a subir por los escalones rapidamente, ya que la inesperada energía que atravesaba mi cuerpo no me dejaba ir lento. Mi corazón se aceleró aún mas en cada paso, y no creía que era por el ejercicio. Llegue a la estancia de la segunda planta y rapidamente empecé con el segundo piso cuando choqué con algo. Alguien. Fue inesperada y fugaz la reacción que tuvo mi cuerpo para alcanzarla y detener su caída, tal y como debí hacerlo en aquella ocasión. Era imposible no reconocerla al instante, era imposible no estrecharla entre mis brazos. Había soñado tanto con volver a verla, con volver a sentirla. Quería que ella regresará, quería ser yo quien la recibiera con los brazos abiertos y no quien la buscará. Por primera vez desde que se fue pudé sentirme en paz, pude volver a respirar, volví a sentirme vivo. Empezó a llorar aferrabada a mi pecho. Mis manos acariciaban su cabello, trantando de tranuilizarla sin poder creer aun que en verdad esto erá pasando. Tantos meses de espera. Tantas noches llenas de temor por perderla, por no tener la oportunidad de buscarla ya sea por esa maldita enfermedad o por mi estúpido orgullo. - Lo siento…- sus palabras rompieron mi corazón porque sabía que ella tambien tenía tanto miedo de haberme perdido por sus desiciones. Tome suavemente su mentón para mirarla. Esperaba que pudiera leer mis pensamientos y lo que mi alma gritaba como siempre ella podía hacerlo. Sus ojos estaban llenos de arrepentimiento y suplica y yo era el único que podía apartar esos sentimientos. - Aún te amo, Alexandra. – No quería que lo dudara. Ambos estabamos hechos el uno para el otro, aunque eso sonará cliché, pero era la única forma de explicar lo mucho que nos necesitábamos. No resistí por mas tiempo, tenía que besarla. Tenía que volver a sentirme vivo, tenía que traer de regreso la felicidad a mi vida y solo sus labios podían hacerlo. Un beso. Poetas y escritores a traves de los tiempos se han esmerdado por escribir grandes obras en base a lo mágico de un beso. Un beso que puede trasmitir desde ternura hasta pasion, desde deseo a desesperación, desde añoranza a felicidad o tristeza, pero nadie nunca sentirá ni vivirá lo que estamos sintiendo con este beso. Nos amamos, nos hemos besado millón de veces, pero este beso se siente como el primero. Muy pocas personas han tenido la oportunidad de que su primer beso lo hayan entregado a su verdadero amor, pero nadie nunca ha tenido la oportunidad de vivir nuevamente su primer beso y con la ese alguien que es dueña de tu corazón. Juro que me sentí de esa manera. Ese beso era tan especial como el primero que das en la vida, y el primero que das a la persona que amas. Si creía haber conocido el cielo, diría que no tiene comparación con esto. - Josh… - Su nombre en mis labios me hizo sonreír. - Bienvenida, mi amor. Ambos sonreímos sobre los labios del otro, y en medio de sollozos y sonrisas volvimos a besarnos. Suavemente la atraje con cuidado sobre mi cuerpo alejándonos de los escalones para terminar en el sofá de la estancia de ese piso. Me acomodé sobre el sofá y ella se colocó a horcajadas en mis piernas. En otras ocasiones la intensidad de nuestros besos y caricias nos llevaría directo a una situación en que la ropa sobra pero esta vez cada acto solo era porque lo necesitabamos. Necesitabamos la cercanía, necesitabamos aferrarnos al otra y a la idea de que esto era realidad. - No sabes lo mucho que esperé esto, temía que nunca podría volver a tenerte. - La tristeza de su voz me envolvía. - Tú no querías que te esperara… - Se lo que dije, pero no era lo que en verdad quería. Lo sabes, Josh. Sabes que te amo, sabes que eres el único. – Sus ojos aún tenían lágrimas y por un momento su mirada se detuvo en mis ojos llenándose de miedo. – Tú…¿Tienes a alguien? Empezó a apartarse de golpe. Tomó todo de mi fuerza retenerala. Sabía que su llanto aumentó y paso de ser una de felicidad a uno de pérdida. – No, Alex. – Me costaba mucho porque no me escuchaba y no hacía mas que luchar con apartarse de mí. - Déjame, Josh. – rogó sollozando. – Lo prometí… si tú encontrabas a alguien yo no iba a interferir. Lo lamento. - Solo te quiero a ti. - No, Josh. – Su mirada estaba escondida bajo su cabello. – Yo… yo siempre seré un desastre, siempre complicaré tu vida… será mejor si tienes a alguien más. No te preocupes por mí… Tomé su rostro entre mi manos para que sus ojos puedan leer los míos. – No existe nadie más. Nunca habrá nadie más porque simplemente no existe nadie más para mí que no seas tú. Y sí, eres un desastre y me complicarás mi vida, pero quiero eso para mí, tu desastre y tus complicaciones, eso me basta para ser feliz. Solo quería que te retractes, solo quiero escuchar que no vas a dejarme nunca más y no soportas la idea de alguien que no sea tú a mi lado. Sus labios estuvieron nuevamente en los míos atacandome con intensidad, no me tomó mas de un segundo en responder. - ¿Fue eso un sí? - Eso fue un te amo y siempre serás él único. Nunca te dejaré por ir porque no permitiré que nada me aleje de ti nunca más a menos que tu me quieras apartar. No imagino mi vida si tú no estás en ella, no te quiero con nadie más, eres solo mío como yo soy solo tuya. No hay palabras suficientes para expresar exactamente lo que siento por ti. Decir \"te amo\" no basta para explicar lo que significas, no basta para decirte que eres todo lo que necesito, que eres la razón por la que vivo. – Tomó aire. – Me he equivocado tantas veces pero lo único que no me arrepiento es haber abierto mi corazón a ti, aunque creo que ni siquiera tuve oportunidad de decidir porque tú te adueñaste sin que me de cuenta. No se lo que ves en mí, pero espero que siempre lo encuentres porque no quiero perderte. Quiero que siempre me ames. Nos aferramos en un gran abrazo llenándonos de la calidez que la cercanía del otro. Luego de un momento decidí iniciar una conversación. - ¿Cuándo llegaste? - Hace 3 días. – Tres días en los que pude tenerla. - ¿Cuándo pensabas buscarme? – No quería reclamarle nada pero necesitaba respuestas. - La verdad, no estoy segura. Quería saber sobre ti, si tenía aún la posiblidad de luchar. Creí que seguirías mi consejo… - Ya no tiene caso de que hablemos sobre esto. – Su cabeza se acomodó en mi hombro como una niña pequeña. – Lo importante es lo que vamos hacer de aquí en adelante. - Hemos perdido mucho tiempo. – concordó besando mi mentón logrando que me estremeciera. – Ahora que lo pienso, en estos momentos debería estar con un contratista. - Yo igual. Nos tomó un momento entender la situación. – Peter. – Ambos entendimos su enredado plan para reunirnos. - Personalmente cuando lo vea le daré un beso. – aseguré. - Tus besos son solo míos, Hutcherson. No hagas que me ponga celosa. – dijo juguetona. - Todo yo te pertenezco, Alexandra. – Dejé un pequeño beso en su nariz. – Supongo que no hay ningun contratista por hoy. Deberíamos ir a…. algún lado. Se colocó a horcajadas nuevamente. – Acabo de mudarme a mi nuevo apartamento en el mismo complejo de edificios que Peter. Las cosas aún están en cajas pero… quiero que lo veas. Personalmente me encanta. - ¿Qué pasó con tu otro departamento? - Darío, Fer y Santy viven en él. No sentí correcto regresar ahí. Es hora de empezar mi propia vida y puedo permitirme un nuevo departamento. - Entonces vamos. – dije levantándola en mis brazos y poniendome de pie. – Quiero conocer mi nuevo lugar. Luego de un momento me hizo dejarla en el suelo. Le ofrecí mi mano y ella entrelazó nuestros dedos sin dudarlo. Podía caerse el mundo en estos momentos y no me importaría porque con ella a mi lado podía abrir el cielo y destruir el infierno. No hicieron falta palabras en el camino hacia su nuevo departamento, ambos estábamos completos por estar con el otro. Solo bastaba mirar sus ojos para darme cuenta lo mucho que ella me quería. Estábamos listos para empezar de nuevo. Somos todo lo que necesitamos. Había cajas por todo lado. El departamento era espacioso con una habitación principal con hermosa vista y 2 habitaciones adicionales. Una cocina, un comedor, una sala. – Creo que es muy grande para ti sola. - También he pensado en ello, pero me di cuenta que en realidad no estaré sola. - ¿Eso quiere decir que estoy totalmente invitado a quedarme? – Posé mis manos en su cintura y le acorralé contra el mesón de la cocina. Levanté su cuerpo para que se sentará sobre él y sus pierna se enrollarón a mi alrededor. – Porque yo soy una persona que se toma muy en serio las invitaciones, así que prepárate para verme aquí a diario porque pienso estar el menor tiempo posible sin ti. - Pues fíjese señor que me ha entendido mal. – Sus dedos jugaban con mi cabello. – Lo que quiero decir es que usted está invitado a hacer de este sitio su lugar permanente. - ¿Estás pidiendo que viva contigo? – pregunté emocionado. – Di que sí, por favor. No me hagas rogar. - Si, Josh. Quiero que vivas conmigo. Quiero que traigas tu ropa y compartir el armario, quiero que me acompañes y decicir nuestro muebles y cortinas y hacer de este lugar un hogar para los dos. No tiene sentido esperar mas tiempo si ambos sabemos que estaremos juntos. Por un momento quisé llorar, por que tenía miedo de que este sea un sueño. – Alex… desde que éramos novios siempre soñé con un futuro a tu lado, esperaba planear cada cosa de nuestras vidas… no sabes lo feliz que me siento. - Yo también. – su mano acarició mi mejilla, coloqué la mía sobre ella. – Será mejor que nos pongamos manos a la obra con mis cosas por lo menos. Mañana podemos traer las tuyas. Pretendo estrenar hoy este lugar. - Quiero quedarme de esta manera por siempre. - Nada de ello, señor perezoso. Tenemos tiempo de sobra para esto. Pasado mañana regreso a mi posgrado y pretendo que este departamento este listo. - ¿Regresarás a clases? – pregunté anonadado. En realidad quería todo su tiempo para mí y sabía perfectamente sus horarios. - Pretendo graduarme el año siguiente asi tenga que doblar turnos. - Si crees que es lo mejor… - Es lo que quiero, Josh, y necesito tu apoyo en esto. - Sabes que te apoyaré en todo lo que necesites. Sonrió y depositó un beso en mis labios. Empezó a caminar limpiando la leve capa de polvo con un paño. Era una trabajo pesado pero estaba feliz de mover pesadas cajas solo por ella. Pedimos pizza para cenar y me dediqué a lavar la vajilla que usamos mientras ella se daba un baño. Decido a tomar una ducha antes de dormir me encontré con ella envuelta en una toalla. Tenía toda la intención de quitar esa toalla de su cuerpo y dedicarme a adorarlo toda la noche. Hicimos contacto visual y ella se aferró a ese bendito pedazo de tela. – Ni se te ocurra, Joshua. Quiero dormir y mañana tenemos un día muy pesado. Tú tomaras una ducha y yo me encargo de llamar a Peter y a mi mamá para que no se preocupen sobre mi paradero. Haciendo pucheros me dirijí a la ducha. La verdad era que yo también estaba muy cansado pero la idea de mi chica en mis manos podía recargarme rápidamente. Cuando salí del baño completamente desnudo me encontré con mi chica ya metida bajo las sábanas mirando por la ventana. Me uní a ella sacándola de su ensoñación. Nuestros cuerpos desnudos se amoldaron perfectamente, como piezas que caían en su lugar, al fin. - Se siente… perfecto. – Su cabeza sobre mi pecho, mis manos acariciando su espalda. - Es irreal. No creí volver a tener un momento como este. Te extrañé demasiado, Josh. - Me conformó saber que estás sana, y que la vida nos ha ofrecido una nuevo comienzo para estar juntos. - 8 meses sin una sola célula maligna en mi cuerpo. Me dieron el alta, aunque tengo que ir al médico cada mes durante un tiempo. - Algo dentro de mi corazón me dice que no volveremos a pasar por eso. – entrelacé nuestros dedos y besé esa unión. – Y estaremos juntos para siempre. Sonrío. - Para siempre es un largo tiempo, pero será insuficiente si estás a mi lado. ***Hooola :) bueno, les dire que no me convenció el capítulo pero no he tenido tiempo de analizarlo y no quería hacerles esperar mas... tengo que correr a seguir estudiando así q solo dire que espero sus reviews :) MILET AVANCE: - ¿Recuerdas mi fantasía? - ¿La de hacerme el amor en esta cama mientras intentábamos que tú familia no nos escuchará? Por supuesto ¿cómo podría olvidarla? – dijo cepillando su cabello. – Pues tienes mala suerte, chico porque tampoco tendrás suerte estos días. - Ni me lo recuerdes. – dije sentándome en la cama.[Chapter 114] Capítulo 114 - ¿Te gusta el verde para nuestra habitación? – Josh me enseñaba una cortina. Estábamos comprando muebles para nuestro departamento. - No. Quiero algo más acogedor. - Mientras no sea rosa. – Siguió mirando diseños de tela. – Creo que encontré lo que quieres. Me acerqué a su lado y me enseñó las cortinas que definitivamente me convencieron. Era una mezcla de negro y blanco, moderno y acogedor. – Perfectas. - Sabría que te gustaría. – dijo besando mi mejilla. – Queremos estás. La vendedora nos sonrío. - ¿Algo más en que pueda ayudar? - Creo que tenemos los suficiente para nuestro nuevo hogar. – Josh sonreía cada vez que pronunciaba las palabras \"nuestro\" y \"hogar\", no quería admitir lo emocionada que me sentía también. - Les entregarán los muebles, las alfombras y las cortinas por la tarde, y las lámparas y otros adornos mañana temprano. - Muchas gracias. – Dijo mi… ¿novio?. Yo asentí hacia la vendedora y me dejé arrastrar por Josh. - ¿Qué somos, Josh? – pregunté una vez en la calle. – Quiero decir ¿Qué tipo de relación tenemos? ¿cómo debo presentarte? – por alguna razón necesitaba escuchar esas palabras de sus labios. Hizo que nos detuvieramos un momento. Había cierta mirada traviesa en su rostro. – Podría decir que eres mi novia, pero siento que es insuficiente. Aún no estamos casados, así que no puedo decir que seas mi esposa… no me importa las denominaciones, Alex. Lo que importa es que nos pertenecemos el uno al otro… ante el mundo puedes decir que soy tu novio, muy pronto tu prometido y algún día tu esposo, pero siempre serás mía… mi mujer. - Eres tan cursi, mi vida. – Tomé su rostro entre mis manos para deleitarme con sus labios. – Tienes razón, te pertenezco, soy solo tuya. - No me beses de esa manera a menos que quieras que demuestre lo mucho que me perteneces en este lugar. Sabía que era el momento de tocar cierto tema y creo que no va a tomarlo de la mejor manera. - ¿Josh… me querrías si te dijera que no puedo estar contigo de esa manera por 4 meses más? Su rostro se contrajo de una manera extraña. – Explícamelo, por favor, por que creo que entendí mal. Esto iba a ser dificil. – Josh, tengo prohibido tener relaciones sexuales por 4 meses mas. Una vez que tenga 1 año sin remisión tengo visto bueno para ello. - ¿Por qué? – preguntó claramente irritado. Varias personas giraron a observarnos. - Porque no puedo quedar embarazada de nuevo y no puedo usar anticonceptivos. - Pero podemos usar preservativos ¿no? – preguntó esperanzado. - No, Josh. No puedo confiar esta vez en eso. – Su rostro se tornó oscuro y en sus ojos leí lo que ocurría. – No te culpo, no es que no confíe en ti, lo que nos ocurrió antes fue un accidente. – Me aseguré de fijar su mirada sobre la mía para que se diera cuenta que todas mis palabras eran sinceras. – Un condón puede fallar, puede romperse… hasta podemos olvidarnos en uno de nuestros arranques. Tú como yo sabes como de fácil es perdemos en medio de nuestras caricias. - ¿Sabes lo dificil que será tenerte tan cerca y no tenerte de la manera que deseo? Dime por favor que es una mala broma. – Sus manos en mis caderas y mis brazos en su cuello. - No hagas pucheros, pequeño. Entenderé si no estás dispuesto a seguir… - Calla tontita. – dijo poniendo un dedo en mis labios. – Sabes que lo nuestro es mucho más que sexo, no niego que será difícil, por no decir casi imposible pero te digo lo mismo que te dije cuando éramos novios: espararé por siempre si es necesario porque nada es mejor que hacer el amor contigo. - Estás haciendo que me sienta mal. Sonrío. – Solo por ti pequeña, solo por ti haría cosas como esta. Te amo tanto que a veces tengo miedo de la intensidad de mis sentimientos. ¿Cómo no podía amarlo aún más? ¿Cómo no enamorarse de él cada día mas? La respuesta era fácil: NO PODÍA, él era todo lo que quería en esta vida. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-* - Bienvenidos. – Mi madre nos envolvió en un gran abrazo. - Gracias, Michelle. – Dijo mi chica devolviéndole el abrazo a mi madre. – Perdón la tardanza, perdieron nuestro equipaje en el aeropuerto. - Pierde cuidado. Pero apresurense a instalarse que todos están ansiosos por la cena. No nos dejó acercarnos a la sala donde las voces del resto de mi familia nos llamaban ya que nos empujó por la escalera. Déjamos nuestras maletas y abrigos en mi habitación. – Es raro regresar a este sitio. - ¿Recuerdas mi fantasía? - ¿La de hacerme el amor en esta cama mientras intentábamos que tú familia no nos escuchará? Por supuesto ¿cómo podría olvidarla? – dijo cepillando su cabello. – Pues tienes mala suerte, chico porque tampoco tendrás suerte estos días. - Ni me lo recuerdes. – dije sentándome en la cama. Odiaba no poder tocarla como quería. Quería tanto hundirme en su cuerpo… estos últimos meses han sido tan… difíciles. Teníamos que tener cuidado ya que muchas veces de un simple beso habíamos acabado practicámente entre las sábanas. Habíamos llegado a un acuerdo de como mantenernos entretenidos evitando el coito, pero sinceramente los juegos previos no se comparan con la sensación de fusionar nuestros cuerpos. - Los días siguen pasando, pronto podremos hacer lo que sea. – Se colocó a horcajadas sobre mí. – Podremos hacer todo lo que quieras, dejaré que hagas conmigo lo que quieras. – Sus labios en mi cuello me volvían loco. – Y yo podré hacer contigo lo que me apetezca. Pienso recompensarte por tu paciencia. - Si sigues de esa manera no estoy seguro de que mi paciencia dure mucho. Sus labios dejaron mi cuello para encontrarse con los míos. Gemí y no pude evitar el calor que invadió todo mi cuerpo. Amaba cuando ella desataba su pasión, hacía que cada célula de mi cuerpo se estremeciera. Dos golpes en la puerta bastaron para que mi chica se apartara. – Mas les vale no estar desnudos porque estoy a dos segundos de tumbar esta puerta. Alex se apresuró a abrirla y se abalanzó sobre Connor quien la recibió sin preambulos, como si esperara esa reacción de mi chica. – Estamos esperándolos para cenar. - Pues vamos. – dijo mi chica. - ¿Vienes, mi amor? - Vayan ustedes, yo… solo… iré pronto. – no pude evitar sentirme incómodo. Me revolví incómodamente tratando de que mis vaqueros tengan mas espacio para mi pequeño Joshi ya despierto. - Vale. No tardes. – Me guiñó antes de desaparecer. La muy maldita sabía lo que había provocado en mí. Me tomó 10 minutos y mucha agua helada para estar en mejores condiciones. Saludé a toda mi familia quienes se había acomodado alrededor de la mesa listos para la cena navideña. Todos amaban a mi chica, ella los tenía a todos en su bolsillo y eso solo me hacía amarla aún mas. Por suerte habían dejado un lugar para mí a su lado. Tan pronto como me senté nuestros dedos se entrelazaron. Le dediqué una mirada para encontrarme son su bello rostro adornado por una sonrisa. Todos estaban atentos a sus palabras y no pude evitar sentirme como en el mismo paraíso. Despues de todo lo que hemos vivido, a pesar de cada lágrima, todo ha valido la pena si el resultado seguía siendo este: ella conmigo. Me acerqué a su oído para susurrarle: - Te amo. Me devolvió la mirada. – Yo te amo más. – respondió depositando un fugaz beso en mis labios. Toda mi familia, mis padres, mi hermanos, tíos y primos empezaron a aplaudir. Mi chica se sonrojó y yo la atraje hacia mí. Tomé mi copa de champagne y me preparé para realizar el brindis. – Solo quiero brindar por el gran amor que tengo a mi alrededor. Que la felicidad nos invada no solo está navidad, si no todos los días de nuestra vida. – levanté mi copa - Brindo por esta navidad, brindo por todos ustedes familia… y brindo por Alex, el amor de mi vida. Salud. - Salud. – brindaron todos. Y realmente quería congelar este momento por siempre porque de todos mis momentos felices este sería uno de los mas preciados. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-* - No sabes lo mucho que me alegra verte. – No pudé evitar enredar mis brazos alrededor de su cuello. Sus manos estrecharon mi cintura pegándome completamente a su cuerpo. - Me alegra tanto verte bien.- Darío acarició mi mejilla. - Gracias. Estar de regreso es genial. – No había visto a Darío desde que partí a Londres, nos habíamos mantenido en contacto a traves de mensajes. Cuando regresé el se encontraba disfrutando sus vacaciones en nuestro país y apenas había vuelto me buscó. - Puedo imaginarlo. – Su brazo envolvió mis hombros y empezamos a caminar. – Un pajarito me contó que regresaste con Josh y que vive con él. - No deberías consultar con pajaritos, podrías habérmelo preguntado. Por cierto, tú hermano es un chismoso. – Ambos reímos por que era verdad, Santy era peor que una señora solterona y criticona. - Sabes… estoy feliz por ti y Josh. Merecían una oportunidad, me alegra que dieras el gran paso. - Tarde o temprano iba a ocurrir. Terminaríamos viviendo juntos, era inevitable, para que esperar más. Deberías visitarnos en algún momento. Me miró pensativo. – No creo que Josh este feliz con mi visita. - Oh vamos, Josh sabe que lo amo y que tú nunca saldrás de mi vida. Eres importante, Darío. - Lo sé, lo sé. – Tocó con su índice la punto de mi nariz. – Tú siempre serás una parte importante de mi vida pero admite que tu novio es un manojo de celos. Pensaba refutar pero él tenía razón. Josh era un chico celoso. – Bueno, se le pasará algún día. No puede celarme con todos mis amigos. - Algo me dice que tiene algo contra mí. – No pudimos dejar de reír. Llegamos a una heladería y nos sentamos a charlar. Era cómodo poder tenerlo de regreso, a pesar de todo, a pesar de nuestro pasado, Darío es maravilloso, tenía razón cuando decía que era fácil enamorarse de él porque es una persona llena de virtudes. El problema erradicó en que él no era para mí. A pesar de lo que le hice no me guarda rencor y ahora somos verdaderos amigos. Creo que toda la situación nos hizo madurar a ambos, ahora sabemos que nuestra relación despues de todo no era sana, y en algún momento ibamos a terminar golpeándonos contra una pared de realidad. Luego de un instante una rubia conocida atravesó la puerta. Pude ver el brillo en los ojos de aquella chica cuando localizó a Darío aunque creo que mi presencia no le agradó demasiado. Darío le recibió con un pequeño besos en sus labios, todo un caballero. – Me alegra que llegarás. – Susurró. - ¿recuerdas a Alex, verdad? - No creo que me haya olvidado luego de todas escenas que hice. – Era un tema incómodo hablar sobre nuestra realción pero lo mejor que podíamos hacer era tomarlo con humor. – Es un gusto poder conocerte finalmente de la manera adecuada. Mis palabras la hicieron relajarse. – Mucho gusto, Alexandra. Soy Sidney. Se sentó junto a Darío quien rápidamente pasó su brazo sobre sus hombros para sujetar su mano, entrelazando sus dedos. Hacían una linda pareja. – Me alegra que estén juntos. – Lo decía de corazón. – Este chico merece lo mejor, te has sacado la lotería, chica. - Tampoco soy un ángel. - Lo eres. – dijimos ambas al unísono y empezamos a reír. Decidí que está chica me agrada y si era la indicada para Darío yo daría todo de mí para tener una buena relación con ella. - Será mejor que me vaya. – dije mirando la hora, debía ir o llegaría tarde a mi turno nocturno. – Son bienvenidos a visitarme cuando quieran. Josh se alegrará en conocerte, Sidney. Le tomó un buen rato darse cuenta de lo que quería decir, meintras que Darío lo captó de inmediato y ambos reíamos como desquiciados mientras nos depedíamos. Me di cuenta que cada cosa iba cayendo en su lugar. Me alegraba se haber hecho lo correcto con respecto a Darío y dejarlo ir. Él merecía encontrar ese amor único como el que yo tenía. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-* En medio de mis sueños sentí que llegó a mi lado. Estiré mi brazo para que su cuerpo desnudo entre en contacto con el mío. Ninguno de los dos usaba nunca ropa para dormir. - No quería despertarte. – Sus labios rozaron los míos. - Me hubiera gustado esperarte despierto, pero el sueño me venció. - No es bueno que te desveles. – Su cabeza se posó sobre mi pecho. - Deberías saber que cuando no estás mi manera de no extrañarte es contar los segundos para verte, además, esta cama es muy grande sin ti. Se río. – Esta cama es tan grande que podría entrar 5 personas más. Ella siempre hacía bromas sobre el tamaño de la cama que compré, decía que le tomaba todo la mañana arreglarla. – Cuando tengamos hijos tendremos espacio suficiente para dormir todos juntos. - Solo lo dices para que me conforme y no te obligue a lavar las sábanas y cobijas. – Pasó su mano por mi abdomen haciendo que me estremeciera. – Sabes… hoy vi a Darío. Sabía que no debía pero no pude evitar enojarme ante su mención. – No me siento completamente feliz por eso. - Por Dios, Josh.. ya deberías superar esos celos. Él es mi amigo y una parte importante de mi vida que nunca desaparecerá, sería más fácil si empezaras a aceptarlo. - No puedo olvidar que él te tuvo. Mi corazón duele solo de recordarlo. - En realidad él nunca me tuvo por completo porque siempre te pertenecí. – Su mano acarició mi mejilla. – Además él ya tiene a alguien. ¿Qué mas quieres que haga para demostrarte que no siento nada por él y que tú eres él único para mí? - Cásate conmigo. – dije en tono duro. – Eso me quitaría cualquier duda. No era la primera vez que se lo proponía, mas siempre recibía la misma resúesta. - Me lo estás ordenando. – Dijo divertida. – ¿Cómo se supone que acepté? - Lo siento. No quiero ordenarte, te lo estoy proponiendo. ¿Aceptas? – Quiero tanto que acepte de una vez por todas ser mi mujer. - No, pero gracias por preguntar. – Estampó sus labios con los míos. Gemí frustrado y exitado. - No es justo, quiero que tu apellido sea Hutcherson. - Oh vamos Josh, tenemos tiempo para ello. Organizar una boda lleva mucho tiempo y trabajo, no quiero contratiempos hasta que me gradué. – Para lo que faltan aún muchos meses. - Siempre evades el tema. – hice un puchero. - Y tú eres un niño caprichoso. – su tono de voz era divertido. - Solo quiero que aceptes casarte conmigo, nos comprometamos, fijemos una fecha para despues de que te gradúes. – Mi tono de voz era patético. - Esa no es manera de pedir algo tan importante. – Ella se divertía totalmente con mi actitud. – A las mujeres nos gusta la creatividad y el romance. - Entonces… ¿Si logró algo completamente cursi, aceptarás? –Tal vez. – dijo mientras dio un gran bostezo. - Dulces sueños, mi amor. Han sido varios intentos fallidos pero tenía el plan perfecto, no solo para que nos comprometamos si no para apresurar la boda. En una semana estaríamos en París. Logré convencerla de que merecíamos unas vacaciones y aprovecharíamos sus 2 semanas libres que gracias al cielo coinciden con San Valentín. Sería el momento perfecto para iniciar una nueva etapa con la persona que más amo. Hooola :) no tarde tanto esta vez.. la verdad es que el sábado pude escribir mucho :) Solo quiero decir que estoy muy muy agradecida x seguirme hasta aquí, por seguir la historia y dejar siempre susu comentarios...

Espero que el final les guste, q en realidad está costando mucho... no se como terminarlo, tengo la idea pero quiero lograr que en verdad llegue a sus corazones :P Soy cursi.. lo sé Nos leemos luego :D MILET AVANCE: - ¿A dónde vas tan apresurada? – preguntó acerándose a mi. Di un paso atrás instintivamente. Alguien me debía una explicación. – Oh, vamos. No te enfades. Me encontré con unos conocidos y perdí el sentido del tiempo. - ¿Y no pudiste llamarme? – Pusé mis manos en sus caderas. Su mirada cayó en mi cuerpo, un toque de lujuria brilló. – Te ves tan sexy cuanto te enfadas. – Nuevamente empezó a acercarse a mi y me vi obligada a retroceder hasta que me encontré con la cama. - Me estás mintiendo, Hutcherson.[Chapter 115] Capítulo 115 – Primera Parte. - Es hermoso. Mucho mejor que todas esas fotos. – No podía dejar de ver las luces alrededor de la Torre Eiffel. Desde nuestra habitación la vista era maravillosa. - No tan hermoso como tú. – No había notado que Josh había salido de la ducha. Apenas habíamos llegado al hotel. - No puedo esperar para recorrer todo. - Me encanta cuando estás así de emocionada. – Estampé mis labios con los suyos en un ávido beso que no dudó en responder. - A mí me encantas tú. Un montón de besos después nos dispusimos a comer la cena que pedimos. - ¿Quieres que vayamos a algún lugar esta noche? - La verdad estoy tan cansada que no disfrutaría del paseo. ¿Te parece si dormimos? - Lo que tu prefieras. – me sirvió una copa de vino tinto. - Estás planeando algo. – Aseguré. Josh estaba demasiado condescendiente y eso solía pasar cuando se sentía culpable. - Nada de eso… solo tenía ganas de salir, pero estás cansada… - Si quieres salir puedes hacerlo. Estaré bien, pequeño. - No sería lo mismo sin ti. – Me moví de mi lugar para sentarme en su regazo y abrazarlo. - Quiero que te diviertas, Josh. No todo el tiempo estaremos juntos, además no tiene nada de malo que cada uno haga cosas por su lado. – Besé su nariz. – Ve, toma una copa en el bar, juega en el casino, haz lo que desees. Solo regresa pronto para que descanses porque mañana serás solo mío. - Soy tuyo en todo momento, aunque me encuentre lejos. – Sus manos empezaron a jugar por todas partes de mi cuerpo. Una oleada de deseo empezó a invadir mi cuerpo, sentía como cada una de mis células despertaba anhelando su toque. - Estás torturándome, Josh. – Mi voz sobre sus labios eran un gemido. - No tanto como me tortura tenerte cerca y no poder tocarte como quisiera. - ¿Alguna vez hablé sobre mi obsesión con sus manos? ¡Oh, Sus manos! Eran tan grandes y gruesas que no me imaginaba como hacía para que se sientiesen tan delicadas sobre mi piel. - Es hora de que te vayas. – No quería apartarlo pero era más frustrante cuando llegabamos más lejos y teníamos que parar. - Si así lo prefieres. – Me levanté de su regazo dándole espacio para que se alistará, al mismo tiempo me preparé para ir a la cama. – Duerme bien, amor mío. Con un beso en los labios y uno en la frente lo vi salir de la habitación. Debía estar muy cansada porque me dormí inmediatamente. Desperté con la luz del sol que iluminaba la habitación. Estiré mi brazo y me encontré con el otro lado de la cama vacío. Josh no había llegado y me empezaba a preocupar. Busqué una bata y me la coloqué dispuesta a ir en su busca. Justo cuando tomé el pomo de la puerta, está se abrió dando paso a Josh. Me tomó un momento analizarlo y notar que en realidad parecía muy descansado para que supuestamente haya pasado toda una noche de juerga. Cuando Josh no dormía lo suficiente solía tener una ojeras tremendas. - ¿A dónde vas tan apresurada? – preguntó acerándose a mi. Di un paso atrás instintivamente. Alguien me debía una explicación. – Oh, vamos. No te enfades. Me encontré con unos conocidos y perdí el sentido del tiempo. - ¿Y no pudiste llamarme? – Pusé mis manos en sus caderas. Su mirada cayó en mi cuerpo, un toque de lujuria brilló. – Te ves tan sexy cuanto te enfadas. – Nuevamente empezó a acercarse a mi y me vi obligada a retroceder hasta que me encontré con la cama. - Me estás mintiendo, Hutcherson. - ¿Porqué haría yo eso? – Había alcanzado el nudo de mi bata deshaciéndolo. - No lo sé, pero no me gusta. – Sus labios fueron a mi hombro empezando un camino hacia mi cuello. – Estaba preocupada. Creí que algo te sucedió y tú apareces tan campante, fresco como una lechuga. No tienes rastros de haber tenido una noche en vela. Sus manos sujetaron mi rostro fijándo nuestras miradas. – Lo lamento, no planeaba llegar tan tarde y debí llamarte para avisar. No lo volveré a hacer. Lo prometo. Ahora vamos a disfrutar de nuestro viaje. En algún lugar entre mi cuello y mis labios, los besos de Josh hicieron que me olvidara de mi enfado. No es fácil mantenerte enojada si lo único que sentías era deseo. Este chico me hacía perder la cabeza. – Es hora de prepararnos para nuestra visita turística. Sin reprochar y aún acalorada por nuestro beso me apresuré a ducharme. Josh tomó nuestra camara y nuestro bolso y salimos del hotel. Todo estaba lleno de corazones y flores. Había olvidado que era San Valentín. Me sentí fatal por no haber conseguido algo para Josh. Llegamos a una plazoleta frente a la torre Eiffel. Muchas personas se detuvieron a contemplar la vista. Habían millones de globos rojos con formas de corazones flotando hacia la torre. Me apoyé en torso de Josh mientras este me abrazaba. – Lamento por no darte nada. - No es necesario. – Respondió besando la parte posterior de mi cabeza. - Tú me trajiste en este viaje. Quisiera darte algo. - Puedes darme algo. – Me giró hasta encararme. – Puedes darme la respuesta que quiero. Sabía que se refería al hecho de poner una fechaa nuestro matrimonio. – No puedo darte una respuesta si no haces la pregunta. – Si supiera que vas a decir \"SI\" te pediría que te casaras conmigo ahora mismo. Pero prefiero asegurarme que tu respuesta sea afirmativa y que todo sea perfecto. – Así que todo perfecto ¿eh? ¿crees que eso es importante para mí? – Amaba que se preocupara de cada detalle solo para complacerme. – Puedo hacerlo ahora si me vas a decir que sí. –Tienes testigos – Señalé a la gente que camina a nuestro alrededor. – Así que será mejor que lo hagas bien. Josh asintió y se arrodilló. – Oh, vamos. Estaba de broma – Dije intentando levantarle. Toda la gente estaba mirándonos. – No. – Insistió Josh – Me voy a quedar aquí hasta que me prometas que te vas a casar conmigo, que vas a ser la madre de mis hijos y que me vas a advertir cuando haga el ridículo. – Si quieres empezamos ahora mismo – Contesté – Estás haciendo el ridículo. Todo mundo se quedo a nuestro alrededor para observarnos. No podía creer que Josh estuviera haciendo este tipo de bromas. Estaba roja como un tomate con mi vista clavada en todas las personas. Me volví para ver a Josh y mi corazón se acelero. Me di cuenta que no era una broma. Podía ver el brillo de esperanza en sus ojos mientras sujetaba mi mano y no dejaba de mirarme. Saco del bolsillo de su pantalón una cajita y mi corazón se acelero. - Alex. – Dijo serenamente mientras abríala cajita mostrando un delicada anillo de plata con un gran diamante en él. Mi corazón siempre ha sido suyo, y nuestro estado civil no iba a cambiar mis sentimientos. Había querido esperar porque en verdad el tiempo juega en nuestra contra. Pero a final de cuentas siempre mi respuesta sería si. Las lágrimas empezaron a caer, eran lágrimas de felicidad porque hubo tantas veces en mi vida que creí que nunca podría hacer así de feliz. Lo amo, y soy feliz cada segundo que estoy con él. Ahora o más adelante, teníamos que dar este paso, despues de todo ya habíamos dado inicio a nuestra vida. - Sí, Josh. – No creo poder intensificar la oleada de emociones que atravesaron sus ojos. Sabía que él tambien quería llorar, pero no iba a hacerlo, porque ante el resto de gente, él era un macho bien macho y como todo buen macho, no lloraba. Era mi hombre de las cavernas. Suavemente deslizó la sortija en mi dedo para luego ponerse de pie y juntar nuestras frentes. -¿Que dijiste? – Su aliento y el mío se mezclaban. - Que sí y que te amo. - repetí - No te escucho. – Gritó. - Josh hay mucha gente aquí. Ya le dimos suficiente espectáculo. – A pesar de la emoción por la situación me sentía avergonzada. -No me importa, lo único que quiero es oírte gritar que me amas y que aceptas ser mi esposa. Si no lo haces en 5 segundos te juro que voy a GRIT…- Cubrí con mi mano su boca, porqué había empezado a gritar. - Te amo, Joshua Ryan Hutcherson.- Dije más alto dándole gusto. - Mas fuerte. Grítalo. Puse mis manos en un círculo sobre mi boca y nariz, simulando un megáfono para que todos me escucharan. - TE AMO JOSHUA RYAN HUTCHERSON Y SI, ME CASARÉ CONTIGO. No se quién inicio el beso pero no pude ser más que dar todo de mí en él. Estaba feliz, estaba enamorada y ahora estaba comprometida. La gente a nuestro alrededor empezó a aplaudir, no pude evitar reír. Solo Josh Hutcherson podría lograr algo como esto. Se apartó de mi e hizo una reverencia hacia su público. Yo solo le di un puñetazo en el brazo. – ¿Tan pronto y ya estamos con maltrato doméstico? - Te lo mereces por disfrutar tanto de la atención y por avergonzarme. – Las personas aún sonreían por vernos juntos. - Solo quería asegurarme de tu respuesta. – Besó mi mano donde ahora estaba mi anillo de compromiso. - ¿Cuándo lo conseguiste? – Había algo peculiar en él que me hacía vagamente familiar. - En realidad lo tenía desde hace mucho. – Me fijé nuevamente en mi sortija, cuando el recuerdo llegó a mí sentía nuevamente que quería romper en lágrimas. – Lo conservé cuando me lo regresaste, lo mandé a la joyería para que lo bañaran en plata y le colocaran la piedra. Sentí que era el correcto para ti como lo fue en esa ocasión. Había olvidado el anillo de plata que Josh me dio nuestro primer San Valentín juntos. Nuestra primera vez… Josh tenía razón, era el correcto. - Gracias, Josh. Gracias por todo, por resistir todo lo que te he hecho pasar y por seguir a mi lado. Te amo tanto que estoy tan impaciente por convertirme en tu esposa. - ¿Es eso verdad? – Dijo sosteniendo mi rostro. Asentí, porque me había dado cuenta que no importa cuando nos casemos. Siempre será especial. – Por que te tengo otra proposición. - ¿Otra? No creo que sobrevivir a otro de estos espectáculos. Su rostro volvió a tornarse intenso y esperanzado. – Alex. Quiero que nos casemos hoy. Me tomó un par de segundos entender lo que decía. Estaba sorprendida y empecé a pensar en los porque no era una buena idea hacerlo. Josh no me dejó responder porque siguió con su discurso. – Aquí mismo, en Francia. Está todo listo, Alex. Nos casaremos en Versalles, en Temple de l'Amour como siempre has soñado. En San Valentín. Será la primera boda que se celebre ahí mismo. Hagámoslo, Alex. Es nuestro momento. Podrías adjuntar millares de razones para decir que está era una locura, pero ver a Josh emocionado, haciendo lo posible por cumplir cada uno de mis locos sueños me hacía amarlo aún mas. Locura es amar a alguien de esa manera, y locura sería no abrazar todo lo que me ofrece. - Estoy lista si tú lo estás. – Me levantó entre sus brazos y empezó a girar conmigo. Ya no me importaba que otros nos miraran. Este era el día más feliz de mi vida y era todo lo que importaba. Cuando me dejó sobre mis pies, entrelazamos nuestros dedos y nos apresuramos a nuestro hotel. Josh había preparado todo para nuestro traslado a Versalles, para nuestra boda. Incluso había traído desde nuestro hogar el vestido que mas le gustaba. Aún no había tenido oportunidad de estrenarlo, fue un simple día de compras, cuando lo vimos Josh lo quiso inmediatamente. Era rosa pálido que se podía confundir con blanco. Era de encaje, ceñido al cuerpo, terminaba un poco mas arriba de mis rodillas. El escote era recto pero se extendía hacia mis brazos, dando la apariencia de pequeñas mangas y cayendo hacia atrás para dejar gran parte de mi espalda desnuda. Me encantaba. Josh me dejó en la habitación ya que él se prepararía por separado. En la calle me esperaba un transporte para mi sola que me llevaría a aquel lugar. Cada minuto en la espera me emocionaba más. No eran nervios, era pura ilusión. Era un sueño. No se cómo lo logró Josh pero todo era magnífico. Desde la entrada había millares de velas encendidas guíando mi camino. La noche iba cayendo y con la tenue luz del crepúsculo toda la vegetación de los jardínes tenía un brillo especial Podía ver el iluminado sitio donde estaba el famoso \"Temple De L'amour\", frente a él había un pequeño lago donde millares de velas flotaban en él. Definitivamente Josh había estado muy seguro de mi respuesta. Y hablando de Joh, ahí estaba, tan sexy como siempre. Lucía un esmoquin negro con su camisa blanca. Tenía una sonrisa tan grande que podía ver sus brillantes dientes desde donde estaba. A un lado estaba la persona que llevaría a cabo la ceremonia. Cuando nuestros manos se encontraron mi corazón saltó de felicidad. La ceremonia inició, la verdad no sabía si era francés, italiano o latín, pero solo me concentré en la mirada de Josh. - Tenías todo preparado. ¿Qué hubiera pasado si decía que no? - Sabía que me dirías que sí. – El tamaño de su ego me cegaba. Por un momento el silencio nos rodeo. El señor que celebraba la ceremonia miraba a Josh interrogativamente. Le tomó un instante entender que quería. Me miró fijamente. – Sí, acepto. Me imaginó que repitió la misma frase hacia mí y respondí lo mismo que Josh. – Sí, acepto. Y con un beso sellamos el inicio de nuestra vida. ¿Han escuchado alguna vez que las personas vivimos por un momento en nuestras vidas? Pues estaba segura que este era ese momento que marcaba mi vida. Hooola :) Feliz Navidad ho ho ho ho OK NO, Solo estoy emocionada xq lean este cap, la verdad no lo revisé para nada, ni siquiera una leída pero espero q les guste :) Les cuento q ya terminé de escribir el epílogo y aun tengo sentimientos encontrados porque no quiero terminarla :P Espero sus comentarios, gracias x dejarla y por seguirme hasta aquí :P Nos leemos luego :D MILET PD: Regresé a Twitter Milet7393 AVANCE: - No pienses eso, Josh. Estoy bien mientras este a tu lado y amas tu trabajo, no quiero que dejes algo que te hace feliz. - Tu serías más feliz allá, quiero que estés en tu lugar. Tomo mi rostro entre sus manos para obligarmea mirarla. - Estoy hecha para estar justo donde tú estás.[Chapter 116] Capítulo 115 – Segunda Parte No creía en realidad que esto estuviera pasando, se sentía como un sueño y sin embargo sabía que algún día sucedería pero se veía tan lejano el momento que no me hago a la idea de que esté sucediendo. Ella estaba sencillamente hermosa, la emoción de su alma brillaba en sus ojos, la luz de la noche adornaba su piel. Nunca en mi vida había estado tan seguro de querer algo hasta que puse mis ojos en ella. Y a pesar de todo, del dolor y las lágrimas, de los sacrificios, no cambiaría nada porque conseguí lo mas preciado. Su corazón. Su alma. Su amor. Me di cuenta que el encargado de llevar la ceremonia, algo así como un pastor o padre que bendecía la ceremonia, que en realidad era símbolica porque legalmente no estamos casado, se había quedado en silencio mirándome interrogativamente. No entendía nada de todo lo que había dicho antés pero supe lo que tenía que decir ahora. Era lo mismo que he querido decir en los últimos 7 años. - Sí, acepto. Sentí el pulso de mi novia acelerarse aún más y no dudó en responder cuando le hicieron la misma pregunta. – Sí, acepto. Y de muchos felices momentos junto a ella, este se convirtió en mi favorito. Una frase más que supongo que era algo como: \"Puede besar a la novia\" se dijo, y aunque no hubiera significado eso, fue exactamente lo que hice. Con cuidado acaricié su mejilla y deslizé mi mano hacia su mentón para suavemente atraerle hacia mí. Primero una suave toque de labios, luego una mordida a su labio inferior. Mis manos viajaron por us brazos hasta enrollarse en su cintura, de la misma manera que sus brazos en mi cuello. El inicio de un beso más demandante me llevabo casi al límite así que decidí tomarlo con calma. Ya habría tiempo para eso. De sus labios pase a sus comisuras y luego a sus mejillas con delicados toques lo que logró hacerla reír. – Te amo, mi bella esposa. - Yo lo amo más, mi asombroso esposo. – Sus manos jugaban con los mechones de mis cabellos en mi nuca. - ¿Cuándo hiciste todo esto? Fue… Dios… fue todo un sueño, Josh. - Ayer… bueno, en realidad empecé a planearlo cuando aceptaste el viaje. Ayer tuve que moverme para conseguir las velas, el transporte, y las otras cosas de la ceremonia. Solo me faltaba que tú aceptes. - Creo que acabas de eclipsar a mi pequeña parte adolescente que era cursi. – Besó mi nariz. – Asi que estuviste toda la noche preparando esto. – No tomó mucho tiempo, pero si regresaba cuando aún estabas despierta lo hubieras descubierto. – Ella siempre sabe cuándo miento. – Pedí otra habitación para descansar mientras esperaba y me dormí. No fue mi intención quedarme toda la noche lejos de ti. – Ya no importa. Ahora quiero disfrutar de mi luna de miel. No pude evitar que una enorme sonrisa estúpida se instaurara en mi rostro. – Tengo otra sorpresa para ello. – ¿Ah sí? ¿Debo suponer que estaré de acuerdo? No creo estar lista para otra sorpresa. – Ven. –Tomé su mano y la dirigí entre los árboles hacia su sorpresa. Había quedado perfecto. Logre conseguir una carpa de seda para darnos intimidad. Estaba completamente iluminada por velas. – Es hermoso, Josh. No entiendo como conseguiste todo esto. – Ser una celebridad tiene sus ventajas. Nuestra boda fue la primera en este lugar y cerraron las entradas muy temprano para preparar todo. Estamos lejos del mundo. – Le estreché nuevamente. - Es nuestra noche y lo único que quiero es dedicarme por completo a ti. Quiero adorarte, quiero ser tuyo y hacerte mía… – Es un buen momento para decir que ya pasaron 4 meses. – Dijo picaronamente. – Lo sabía. Incluso llamé a tu médico y me dio el visto bueno. – Eres terrible. – Y me amas. Y yo te amo también. – La levanté en mis brazos y ella se sujetó de mi cuello. – No puedo hacer nada más que pensar en que soy un maldito afortunado, en que tengo todo lo que quiero y que eres mía para toda la vida. A veces tengo miedo de que nada sea real o que pueda perderte… – Nunca me perderás. Estás atrapado conmigo por siempre, en las buenas y en las malas, cuando esté de mal humor y cuando cumpla alguna meta y yo para ti seré lo mismo. – Si caigo, ¿caes conmigo? – No. – Fruncí mi ceño. – ¿No crees que te dejaré caer, verdad? No, Josh. Mientras estemos juntos no habrá razón para dejarnos vencer y no ser felices. No creía que pudiera pasar pero la amo más que hace un segundo. Nos abrí paso dentro la carpa. Ahí estaba un gran colchón de agua sobre la alfombra, también muchas velas que habías perfumado el ambiente y muchos pétalos de rosas repartidos. Lo admitía, era un romántico. No necesitaba que ella hablara para saber que le encantaba todo. Giró hacia mí para besarme suavemente mientras sus manos trabajaban en mi saco y luego en mi corbata. Admitía que una parte de mí moría por llevar todo más rápido, pero prefería saborear cada momento. Sus manos empezaron a trabajar en los botones de mi camisa, abriéndolo, uno a uno para dejar un beso en cada pedazo de piel que dejaba al descubierto. Logré quitármela antes de concentrarme en dejar besos sobre sus desnudos hombros. Mis manos viajaron a la cremallera de su vestido y una vez que estuvo abajo, acaricie su piel. De alguna manera, aquel hermosos vestido cayó a sus pies como un montón de tela, y como siempre me quedé estupefacto ante tal belleza. Mirar su piel brillar bajo la tenue luz de las velas tan solo en bragas era un maravilloso espectáculo que envió ondas de calor a mi pequeño Joshi que reaccionó inmediatamente. La beso desesperadamente porque ahora no estoy seguro de poder resistir más aunque quisiera. Son casi dos años de la últimas vez que estuvimos juntos y maldita sea si he resistido como un campeón. Viví una prueba que cualquier hombre no debería verse sometido así que ahora mi cuerpo prácticamente convulsiona solo de anticipación. Nuevamente la levanté en mis brazos para depositarla sobre las sábanas. Me alejé de ella y me acerqué hacia un reproductor de música que había traído conmigo. No hizo falta que ella preguntara que hacía porque la canción nos envolvió rápidamente. (You and me – Lifehouse: watch?v=rSTejLuYENM ) - Se convirtió en mi favorita. – La dulce sonrisa de su rostro no dejaba de enamorarme. - Es nuestra canción. Siempre, siempre, tú y yo. Avancé con cuidado hasta llegar a su altura. Me dediqué a susurrar la letra de la canción en su oído mientras acariciaba con mi nariz esa zona sensible de ella. Quería dar a entender que este era un nuevo inicio, tal y como lo fue nuestra primera vez. La canción se repetiría una y otra vez, de la misma manera que aquella ocasión. Comencé mi recorrido húmedo por todo su cuerpo. Beso a beso quería adorarla de la manera que se lo merecía. Quería poder demostrar con mi cuerpo el tamaño del amor que le tenía aunque eso sin duda era imposible porque ni siquiera decir \"infinito\" se aproximaba. Retiré sus bragas y con su ayuda mi pantalón y mi ropa interior. Me dejó sobre mi espalda para sentarse a horcajadas sobre mí. Ahora era yo quién gemía con cada cosa que sus labios hacían. Mis manos recorrían cada centímetro de su piel, reclamándola como su dueño. Mis labios querían saborear todo de ella, logrando beber el elixir de su alma. Mi corazón latía desbocado por su presencia porque sin duda era ella quién marcaba el ritmo de mi vida. La dejé sobre su espalda porque en medio de todas las sensaciones necesitaba recobrar algo de control en mi cuerpo. Empecé a masajear sus senos y acariciar sus muslos. Subí lentamente mi mano, acariciando la cara interna de su muslo hasta llegar a su centro que me confirmaba lo deseosa que ella estaba de hacerle mía. Separé sus muslos y me acomodé sobre ella para penetrarla rápidamente logrando sacarnos a ambos un largo gemido. No me moví, porque estuve a punto de correrme por la intensa sensación. Cuando pude controlarla empecé a moverme. Coloqué sus piernas sobre mis hombros para así poder profundizar mis estocadas. Me deleitaba completamente con sus gemidos, ella confiaba ciegamente en mí que me entregaba su cuerpo, su alma y su corazón sin discusión. Y eso para mí era lo más importante – Oh, Dios mío, Josh. – Mi nombre en sus labios me llevó al límite. Me apresuré con las estocadas y con mi mano llegué a aquel punto donde se unían nuestros cuerpos para acariciarlo llevándola instantáneamente al éxtasis. Me derramé dentro de ella cuando sus paredes se contraían sobre mi pequeño Joshi. Tomó todo de mí no dejar caer mi peso sobre ella por lo que me acomodé sobre mi espalda y le atraje sobre mí. Se dejó llevar por mis brazos y acomodó su cabeza en mi pecho. – Estábamos muy deseosos. – Eso es poco. Estaba empezando a volverme loco sin poder poseerte. – Tú me posees, Josh. Cada pedacito de mí es tuyo. – Besó mi pecho. – Me encanta escucharte decir eso. – Me revolví para dejarla nuevamente sobre su espalda. – Muchas palabras, es hora de volver a nuestra luna de miel. Perdí la cuenta de las veces que la hice mía. Nunca más me privaría de esto. Ella era mi completa perdición. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-* Ví los virretes de graduación volar por los cielos. No podía estar mas orgulloso de mi niña. Me acerque a ella y la levanté por la cintura para empezar a girar. Dio un grito por la sorpresa. - Felicidades Doctora Alexandra Hutcherson, Oncóloga. - Aún no soy la señora Hutcherson, no legalmente por lo menos. - Para mí lo eres. – Entrelacé nuestros dedos. – No puedo esperar a mañana. Estoy ansioso por escuchar las palabras del cura: \"Puede besar a la novia\" y hacerlo frente a todo el mundo. - Y si que será medio mundo. No debimos dejar que nuestras madres prepararan todo, he firmado mas de 500 invitaciones. - Dales ese gusto. Si supieran que hicimos otra ceremonia y ya estamos casados, aunque no legalmente, estarían resentidas de por vida. Les debemos eso, auqnue fue mala idea que firmaramos personalmente nuestras invitaciones, ¿no podíamos contratar un caligrafista? - Según tu mamá eso era una falta de respeto. – Dijo mi niña haciendo una mueca. - Pero nadie notaría la diferencia. - Según mi mamá eso pesaría en nuestra conciencia. No pude evitar reír. Ahora creía que presentar a nuestros padres había sido mala idea. Se tratatabn como si conocieran de toda la vida, como mejores amigos y se unían en nuestra contra. Nos apresuramos a llegar junto al resto de invitados, donde se encontraban nuestros padres, nuestros amigos, incluyendo a Darío, y uno que otro familiar. Todos alegres por el triunfo de mi niña y ansiosos por nuestra boda al siguiente día. Habíamos reservado en un restaurante para celebrar el nuevo logro de mi niña, le costo mucho ponerse al corriente pero lo logró y tal como lo había decidido se graduó en la siguiente promoción. Cuando llegamos ahí no pude evitar notar a los paparazzis. Habíamos sido la comidilla de la prensa desde que se anunción nuestro compromiso. Mi niña frunció el ceño cuando los flashes empezaron a azotarnos. Detengo su paso sujetandola de mis manos y sorprendiendola con un gran beso. Cuando terminó ella me mira confundida. – Acabas de darles de que hablar. – Por lo menos ahora publicaran algo que sí paso. – Dije divertido. – Publicaran nuestro beso, y empezarán nuevos rumores. Probablemente me tendrán embarazada con tú bebé. – No quería decir lo mucho que me emocionaba esa idea. – Voy a confirmar la llegada de los gemelos en navidad. – No pudo evitar reírse. Logramos entrar en el restaurante. – Mas te vale conseguir muchos papeles para que puedas mantenernos. – Y mas te vale darme muchos bebés que mantener. – Ya veremos. – No pude descifrar el brillo de su mirada. Quería preguntar pero ya nos habíamos reunido con los demás para el festejo. Ya por la tarde, todos nos presuramos a tomar el avión que nos llevaría a Kentucky donde todo estaba practicamente listo para nuestra boda. El jardín de mi casa era lo suficientemente grande para colocar a casi 800 personas, eso y el hecho que tuve que comprar el lote vacío que se extendía desde el jardín posterior de mi casa hasta la otra calle. En cuanto nos instalamos en nuestros asientos en el avión, mi niña se acurrucó contra mí y se durmió automáticamente. Desde mi asiento escuchaba el parloteo de nuestra familia, pero lo único que en verdad me emocionaba era ver a mi niña dormir. Mi ángel era hermoso, y yo había sido bendecido por tenerla. Había sido un reto ubicar a tanta familia que había viajado para nuestra boda en los hoteles más cercanos a mi casa, y fue mas que un reto preparar la cena para todos en mi casa aquella noche. Y a pesar de eso, disfruté cada minuto. Miré a mi chica con sus padres y sabía lo feliz que estaba de estar a su lado y con todas las demas personas que viajaron desde su país para acompañarla. Sabía que por mí ella se quedaría en los Estados Unidos, no quería ser un sacrificio. Mi madre nos envió a dormir pronto, pudé escuchar muchas bromas sobre que no debería ver a la novia antes de la boda pero definitivamente no pasaría esta noche sin ella. Ambos tomamos una ducha antes de acurrucarnos bajo las sábanas. Mi boda era mañana y la verdad es que no estaba nervioso. Solo complacido, porque boda o no, nada haría que pierda a esta niña. - ¿Estás lista para mañana? - Sip. Estoy completamente lista y segura para ser la señora Hutcherson. ¿Y tú? - Por supuesto… solo… solo quiero darte todo lo que quieres, mi vida y siento que serás mas que feliz de regreso en tu tierra junto a tus seres queridos. - No pienses eso, Josh. Estoy bien mientras este a tu lado y amas tu trabajo, no quiero que dejes algo que te hace feliz. - Tu serías más feliz allá, quiero que estés en tu lugar. Tomo mi rostro entre sus manos para obligarmea mirarla. - Estoy hecha para estar justo donde tú estás. No hubo duda en sus palabras lo que me inidicaba que no mentían. – No creí que fuera posible, pero te amo mil veces mas que hace unos segundos. Un par de besos mas tarde decidimos dormir. No recuerdo lo que soñé pero se que fue una gran sueño porque cuadno desperté me sentía completamente feliz. Abrí mis ojos para encontrarme con los de mi niña mirándome. - Hola, dormilón. – Sus labios besaron mi mentón. - Hola, pequeña. ¿Hace mucho que despertaste? - Un poco, digamos que nuestras madres madrugaron y su parloteo no me dejó dormir más. Envolví mis brazos en su cintura y giré con ella hasta dejarle sobre mí. – Tenemos un día duro ¿eh? - Me siento culpabe por no haberme encargado de ningún detalle sobre mi boda. - Olvída eso. Ahora quiero besarte antes de que me lleven y me mantengan lejos de ti. – Empecé a besar su cuello. - Se supone que no deberíamos estar juntos hasta despues de que el cura diga: \"los declaro marido y mujer\". - Recuerda que esta no es nuestra primera boda, no pasamos juntos aquella noche así que cumplimos la tradición. - Estás loco, mi amor. – Sus labios tomaron posesivamente los míos. - Siempre es un gusto estar contigo. Quiero proponerte algo… Dentro de unas horas me caso y quiero invitarte a mi boda. Sonrío divertida. - Felicidades, ¿cómo debo ir vestida? - De novia. - Tengo el traje perfecto para eso. – Ella siempre me seguía la corriente. Y nuevamente empezamos una sesión de calientes besos, hasta que unos golpes acecharon nuestra puerta. – Alexandra, despídete de tu chico, tienes 5 minutos para hacer que se vaya o yo mismo entraré y lo sacaré a patadas. No me importa si está desnudo, créeme que disfrutaría de un vistazo de su trasero, tengo una seria obsesión con él. Alex empezó a reír. - ¿Debo preguntar? - Solo si ella intenta morder tu trasero nos preocuparemos. No pude evitar besarla de nuevo mientras reía. - ALEXANDRA. – Gritó Fernanda nuevamente. Ambos reímos. - Será mejor de que te vayas o ella es capaz de entrar aquí. No quiero sus manos cerca del trasero de mi chico. - No te preocupes, este sexy trasero siempre será solo tuyo. – Me coloqué un pantalón de deportes y una camiseta antes de inclinarme por un beso se despedida. Era un adicto a sus labios. - Nos vemos pronto. No tardes - Ahí estaré, seré la de blanco. – Guiñó su ojo. Mi sonrisa enamorada permaneció durante todo el día. Todo era una locura, gente entraba y salía preparando todo: comida, decoración, música, etc, etc, hasta que por fin llegó la hora. Los invitados estaban ya listos frente al improvisado altar de rosas que habían colocado y por primera vez desde que esta locura comenzó, empecé a ponerme nervioso. Mis padres se acercaron a mí. Fue bonito verlos juntos, como si no se hubieran divorciado. Me dieron un gran abrazo y un beso cada uno. - Estamos orgullosos de ti, hijo. – Dijo mi padre. Me costó mucho no llorar, solo asentí porque si decía una palabra estaba seguro de que me rompería. Por suerte la música que indicaba mi entrada empezó por lo que ofrecí mi brazo a mi madre quien me acompañaría al altar. Tras de ella mi padre acompañando a la madre de Alex y luego nuestros padrinos y damas de honor donde estaban nuestros amigos, empezando con Fer y Santy, Peter y Alyson, y terminando con Jenn y Liam, incluso Darío y Avan con sus novias. Todo mundo sonreía, incluso había lágrimas de felicidad en los ojos de nuestras madres, y debí admitir que aunque disfrute mucho de nuestra boda solitaria, no se comparaba con el hecho de compartir tus felices momentos con tus seres queridos. Y de pronto la marcha nupcial empezó y juro que mi corazón se detuvo cuando la vi. Era un ángel, era magnífica y hermosa, era un sueño vestido de blanco y caminando lentamente hacia mí. Su vestido era precioso, muy de su estilo, siempre dejando los hombros descubiertos y ajustado a nivel de su busto para luego caer a sus pies de forma suave, formando una cola hacia atrás. Traía un velo que caía sobre su rostro. Estuve tan embobado que no me di cuenta que estaba frente a mí. Su padre me ofreció su mano. Entrelacé nuestros dedos. – Hazla feliz, Josh. - Lo haré. – Respondí a mi suegro, porque era verdad, me desviviré por ello. Suavemente levanté su velo para despejar su rostro. Me miraba de la misma manera que yo, completamente embobados. Giramos para encontrarnos con el sacerdote y dar inicio a la ceremonia. No preste atención a ninguna palabra de la ceremonia, solo me perdí en su mirada, en su sonrisa, y el orgullo que sentía ahora que podía gritar al mundo que ella era mi esposa…. Mi mujer. Mi niña me dio un apretón de manos para indicarme que debía repetir lo que el cura decía. Con todo el amor que pude expresar, dije mis votos: - Yo, Joshua, te quiero a ti, Alexandra, como esposa; me entrego a ti, y prometo serte fiel en las alegrías y en las penas, en la salud y en la enfermedad, todos los días de mi vida. Me sentí tan feliz de decir cada palabra y ansioso por escuchar las mismas palabras de ella: - Yo, Alexandra, te quiero a ti, Joshua, como esposo; me entrego a ti, y prometo serte fiel en las alegrías y en las penas, en la salud y en la enfermedad, todos los días de mi vida. El sacerdote tomó nuestras alianzas y las bendijo. - El Señor bendiga estos anillos que vais a entregaros uno al otro en señal de amor y de fidelidad. Me ofreció una. Sabía lo que tenía que decir, así que la tome con sumo cuidado y empecé a deslizarla en el dedo de mi amada. – Alex, recibe esta alianza en señal de mi amor y fidelidad a ti. Mi ángel tomó su otra alianza. - Josh, recibe esta alianza en señal de mi amor y fidelidad a ti. - Sin más preámbulos, los declaro marido y mujer. – Eran las palabras que estaba desesperado por escuchar. – Puedes besar a la novia. Me acerqué con cuidado, apenas rocé mis labios con los de ella y me aparté lo suficiente para que nuestras frentes estén juntas sin que nuestras bocas se encuentren. Tome su rostro con mis manos. - Te amo. – Susurré. - Te amo más. – respondió con una gran sonrisa. Todos aplaudían y besé a mi chica como debía hacerlo. – Les presento al señor y señora Hutcherson. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O La puerta de nuestra habitación se abrió. Alex se dispuso a entrar pero la detuve para tomarla en mis brazos. – Quiero hacerlo bien, como la tradición manda. - Esto ya lo hiciste en Maldivas, creo que hemos destruido las tradiciones. - La intención es lo que cuenta ¿No? – La dejé con cuidado sobre nuestra cama. Me senté al pie de la cama y tomé sus pies para empezar a masajearlos. Había escuchado decir que estaban adoloridos antes de salir de la recepción y quería que esté relajada porque quería bailar una pieza más. - Tus manos son mágicas, Hutcherson. - Mágicas y traviesas. Y están muy inquietas, quieren quitar tu vestido. - Pronto lo harán. Por suerte pude quitarme el traje de novia antes de venir aquí, lo amé pero pesaba demasiado. - Te veías preciosa en él. – La atraje hacia mí hasta que se sentara en mi regazo. – Quiero bailar contigo una última pieza el día de hoy. - ¿No puede esperar a mañana? Mis pies aún me matan. - Será lento, lo prometo. - Vale. Me acerque al reproductor de música y puse la melodía. En cuanto encontré su mirada pude notar como las lágrimas caían por su rostro. (Desde que te vi – Natalino: www_youtube_com/watch?v=ntwbycbPrTY ) La tomé entre mis brazos y ella apoyo su rostro en mi pecho. Empezamos a movernos al ritmo lento de la canción. No pude evitar susurrarle las palabras de aquella canción. Mis manos alcanzaron el cierre de su vestido negro. Recorrí con mis dedos su piel desnuda. - No puedo creer que recordaras eso. - Como olvidarlo, tú mismo lo dijiste: es la canción más perfecta que he escuchado e iba a llegar el día que te la dedicaran, y todo sería perfecto, porque tú me amas y yo te amo… Esa siempre será nuestra historia. - Te amo tanto, Josh. Te amo hoy y mañana lo haré aún más. Mientras la besaba, mis manos deslizaron su vestido hasta que solo era un montón de tela en el piso uniéndose luego mi propia ropa. La recosté en el colchón y yo me cerní sobre ella, mi mano viajo desde su cuello para bajar entre sus senos y hacia su abdomen. Amaba el abdomen de mi chica, tenía un pequeño rollito que se sentía suave. – Tienes una pequeña pancita aquí. Abrió sus ojos alarmantemente, probablemente no tomaría mi comentario como un cumplido. - ¿Te molesta? ¿Crees que me veo mal? - Todo lo contrario, solo en ti una pancita pudiera ser tan sexy. – Para confirmar mi punto, posé mis labios sobre su ombligo. – No sabes cómo quisiera que tengas una gran pancita llena de mis bebes. Lo decía en serio, era lo que más deseaba en estos momentos. Era un buen momento para empezar a cumplir ese sueño, por lo que volví a besarla con pasión. Ella me detuvo. - Tengo un regalo, para ti. - No tienes que darme nada, cada día a tu lado es un regalo. - Es importante. - Luego me lo das. – Gruñí. - Debe ser ahora, por favor. – Me dejé caer hacia un lado frustrado. Ella se puso de pie. - Volveré antes de que digas otorrinolaringología. - Otorrinolaringología, otorrinolaringología. – Dije instintivamente. - Bueno quizás un poco más lento. Desapareció en el baño para regresar inmediatamente con una pequeña cajita dorada con un moño rojo entre sus manos. Parecía de esas en las que venían esos bolígrafos caros. Definitivamente no entiendo su insistencia con tal regalo. - Gracias. – Dije tomando la caja. Me apresuré a dejarla sobre una mesilla para atraerla de nuevo hacia mí. Ella correspondió a mi gran beso. - ¿No vas a abrirla? - Está bien. – Tomé con cuidado la caja y la abrí rápidamente. Le di un vistazo fugaz y rápidamente me dirigí a ella para proseguir en lo que estábamos pero antes de decir palabra algo me llamó la atención y tuve que volver a mirar la caja. – Oh por Dios. – No pude evitar temblar. – Oh, Dios. Dime que es verdad. - No jugaría con algo así. - ¿Segura? – No podía evitar estar inseguro, a veces tenía miedo de tanta felicidad. Mi mirada estaba fijo en el objeto entre mis manos. Sentía como las lágrimas querían derramarse. – Es lo más probable. Estás pruebas dan falsos negativos, no falsos positivos… así que… - Estás embarazada. – Me costaba creerlo. - Lo estoy, Josh. Serás padre… seremos padres. - Tendrás un bebé mío y tuyo. – Quería convencerme. La miré inquisitivamente, ella solo tenía una gran sonrisa en los labios. - ¿Estás embarazada de un bebé? Rodó los ojos. – Si estuviera embarazada de un perro, me preocuparía, pero estoy 100% segura que es un bebé. Eso me hizo salir de mi estado de trance y dejé a un lado la cajita donde estaba la prueba de embarazo para poder abrazar a mi niña, quien me acababa de dar el mayor de los regalos. - Te amo tanto, Alexandra. Gracias… gracias por aceptar ser mi esposa y por darme este milagro. – La llevé conmigo hacia la cama para sentarla en mi regazo. – Gracias. – Beso – Gracias. – Beso. – Gracias. - Tengo miedo, Josh. – Dijo tristemente. – Estoy tan emocionada, pero tengo tanto miedo de perderlo como pasó antes… - No digas eso, todo estará bien. Yo siempre estaré a tu lado y afrontaremos todo lo que se nos atraviese. - ¿Juntos? Tomé su rostro en mis manos – Juntos por siempre mi amor. - ¿Lo prometes? - Lo prometo y lo juro, pero no solo vamos a prometerlo… Vamos a cumplirlo. Quería gritar de felicidad, realmente me sentía la persona más afortunada. Quería agradecerle a Dios, a la vida, al destino o cualquier identidad que me dio este regalo. – Soy tan afortunado al tenerte… Toda mi vida se ha destinado a buscar el amor de mi vida. - ¿Lo encontraste? – Besé su frente antes de responder. - Lo encuentro cada día en la misma persona.

Me costó mucho sentarme, el dolor había ido en aumento todo el día. Definitivamente estas no eran contracciones de Braxton Hicks** y el dolor en mi espalda se volvió insoportable. - ¡JOSH, DESPIERTA! – Necesitaba ir al médico urgentemente, por suerte había llegado a la semana 36 de gestación, es mucho más de lo que otras madres han logrado. - Mmmm Hmmm – Susurró entre sueños así que seguí sacudiéndolo. - ¿Qué sucede? - Es hora, Josh. – El miedo de que algo malo sucediera empezó a filtrarse en mí. - ¿Hora de qué? ¿Ya amaneció? Maldita sea. No era como en novelas cuando el chico sabía perfectamente que era lo hora de que sería padre. – Josh… YA VAS A SER PADRE, MALDITA SEA. – Grité porque una contracción me atravesó. Se levantó de un brinco prácticamente cayendo de la cama. - ¿ESTÁS BIEN? ¿LLAMO AL MÉDICO? ¿TE LLEVO AL HOSPITAL? RESPIRA PROFUNDO, LO TENGO CONTROLADO, TODO ESTA BIEN. – HAZ EL FAVOR DE CALMARTE. – Gemí, por suerte la contracción estaba pasando. Calculé el tiempo y tenía una frecuencia de 4 contracciones en 10 minutos, estaba entrando en fase activa. – Estoy bien, solo llama al médico y dile que vamos en camino, que tengo 4 contracciones en 10 minutos con intensidad de 2 cruces y duración de 30 segundos, aún no rompo membranas, el entenderá todo eso. Y luego llama a mi mamá y tú mama y diles que es hora. - OK, OK. – Empezó a correr hacia la puerta. - ¡JOSH! - ¿Qué? ¿Te duele? – Preguntó angustiado. - Ponte algo de ropa. – No pude evitar reír en medio de toda esta locura. Se veía tan lindo nervioso. Vio su cuerpo desnudo y se apresuró a vestirse. Nos habíamos acostumbrados a dormir sin ropa, mucho más yo que me sofocaba fácilmente por el embarazo. Siempre tenía un vestido ligero y una bata junto a la cama por cualquier circunstancia. Lo vi correr fuera de nuestra habitación con el celular en la oreja. Tomé una respiración profunda cuando vino otra contracción, era todo lo que podía ser. Rezaba internamente para que todo saliera bien. Y Si corría con suerte llegar a la clínica antes de que rompiera membranas, eso daría tiempo para que el obstetra tome decisiones. Mi madre y mi suegra atravesaron la puerta rápidamente. Michelle se dirigió a mi armario para tomar la pequeña maleta que teníamos preparado con todo lo necesario para mi estadía en la clínica. Mi madre vino a mi lado para ayudar a vestirme. No fue tan difícil ponerme de pie, en cierta forma alivió el dolor. Ambas tenían rostros preocupados pero actuaron con tranquilidad a colocar mi bata y dirigirme hacia el auto que Josh, mi padre, el padre de Josh y Connor tenían listo. Josh había conseguido una Minivan para poder movilizarnos cuando fuéramos varios. Aún no la había estrenado y esta era una gran ocasión. Habíamos conseguido una casa a las afueras de Denver e inmediatamente luego de casarnos empezamos con la remodelación convirtiéndola en nuestro nuevo hogar. Era una gran casa, teníamos que contratar ayuda para la limpieza, pero al mismo tiempo se sentía acogedora, probablemente era el calor de un hogar. Estábamos rodeados por enormes jardines, desde el cerramiento teníamos que recorrer unos 200 metros para llegar a la entrada principal, y por atrás se extendía un gran espacio verde que llegaba hasta un pequeño arroyo, incluso había un pequeño bosque. Podíamos apreciar el maravilloso paisaje desde nuestros grandes ventanales, era nuestra pequeña mansión. Me recordaba a la casa de los Cullen de crepúsculo pero mucho más bella. Habíamos pasado horas con el arquitecto para diseñarla a nuestro gusto. Josh quería un cuarto de juegos, yo quería un cuarto tranquilo de lectura muy aparte del estudio. Josh quería una cancha para baloncesto y yo quería una de fútbol. Por suerte logramos el equilibrio. Hoy era nuestra primera noche en ella, Habíamos trasladado casi todo de nuestro apartamento los anteriores días y habíamos decorado todo. Josh me sorprendió con Baby Shower sorpresa en la tarde, es la razón por la que sus padres y los míos se habían quedado en nuestro nuevo hogar. Mi hermano se había despertado en medio del ajetreo, decidió quedarse en la casa con su esposa y su pequeña, de todas formas no podía hacer nada más. Estábamos demasiadas personas en camino a la clínica, 6 en realidad, y solo una de esas personas tendría que ser atendida. El padre de Josh fue quién condujo todo el camino hacia la maternidad con mi padre de copiloto. Connor, su madre y la mí entablaron una conversación sobre sexos y posibles juguetes y ropa que tendrían que comprar, en el asiento más posterior. Josh y yo nos encontrábamos en el asiento de en medio, estaba recostada en su regazo tratando de respirar profundamente cada vez que venía una contracción. Me di cuenta que Josh no había dicho ni una sola palabra. Miré hacia arriba para encontrarme con su ceño preocupado pero con la mirada perdida. Levanté mi mano para acariciar su rostro lo que le trajo a la realidad. - ¿Estás bien? Sonrío. Su mano empezó a subir y bajar por mi hombro. – Esa debería ser mi línea. No soy yo quien está en trabajo de parto. - Eres tú quien está preocupado y con la mirada perdida. Reprimí gritar en la última palabra porque una contracción fuerte me atravesó. Tardo mucho tiempo y cuando mi útero se relajó líquido amniótico empezó a salir de mí. Había roto membranas. - Apresúrate, Papá. Por favor… - Gimió Josh completamente desesperado. Yo también me preocupe, porque esto daba menos tiempo de acción al médico, y más aún cuando teníamos que viajar más de una hora desde nuestra casa para llegar a la maternidad. - Tranquilo, Josh. – Dije acariciando su mano. – Esto es normal, nada pasará, aún falta mucho tiempo para que seamos padres. Me miró, y aunque quisiera ocultarlo, su rostro estaba lleno de miedo. – No sabes cómo te quiero, mi vida. Eres… eres lo más preciado que tengo. No pudiera vivir si algo te sucediera. - Shhh. – Puse un dedo en sus labios. – No digas eso, amor, nada malo pasara. Para la mañana, seremos padres. Solo besó mi frente, me acurrucó contra él y entrelazó nuestros dedos. El tiempo pareció interminable en medio de las dolorosas contracciones. Josh soportó a mi lado, sabía que quería gritar o salir corriendo, porque él igual que yo odiaba verme sufrir. En la clínica estaba todo listo y me ingresaron rápidamente. Un tacto vaginal y una ecografía después determinaron que tenía dilatación de 10 centímetros, estaba en expulsivo** y que daría a luz de parto natural y no cesárea como era lo más probable. Me trasladaron a la sala de parto. Josh me acompañaría, sabía que no sería bonito y no me hubiera enfadado si prefería esperar, pero él nunca me dejaría sola. El obstetra entro y empezó a realizar la debida asepsia y colocación de campos. - ¿Es seguro el parto eutócico? - Tranquila Alexandra, un embarazo como el tuyo siempre es de riesgo por las posibles complicaciones y lo más probable era que teníamos que hacer cesárea pero no será necesario. Estás en expulsivo y ya hay encajamiento, posición cefálica ambos. Todo irá de maravilla. El alivio me inundo. – Gracias. Josh entró en la sala y se apresuró a mi lado. Entrelazó nuestros dedos. No pude evitar reír cuando noté lo pálido que estaba, ni siquiera mencionaría la posibilidad de que se fuera porque no lo haría y yo tampoco quería que se vaya. – Tranquilo, todo irá bien. - Lo sé. Mi corazón me dice que todo irá bien. Solo espero ser un buen padre. - Lo serás. Serán maravilloso, tan bueno que terminarán odiándome porque tendré que ser la estricta para equilibrar. Sonrío y besó mis labios. - Bien, Alexandra. – Dijo el obstetra. – Ya está aquí. Vamos a pujar cuando llegue la contracción. Mientras más sostengas el pujo será más fácil. - Tú puedes. – Dijo Josh justo cuando me atravesó la contracción. Mantuve con toda mi fuerza en mantener la contracción mientras sentía un gran dolor. Había visto millones de partos y sabía que lo mejor era tomar aire rápidamente y continuar la contracción así evitando que el bebé retroceda y salga a la primera. El dolor fue grande y luego disminuyó drásticamente. – La cabeza está fuera. Una contracción más y habrá salido por completo. Josh dio un vistazo y su rostro se volvió más pálido aún. – Nunca volveré a ver de la misma manera tus partes de señorita. Empecé a reír mientras otra contracción me atravesó y supe que mi bebé había salido. Casi lloré cuando lo colocaron sobre mi vientre mientras pinzaban el cordón umbilical esperando que deje de latir para cortarlo. – Hazlo, Josh. – Dijo el obstetra y Josh se apresuró a cortarlo. Era la cosita más hermosa que podía existir. El pediatra encargado lo secaba y succionaba sus secreciones nasales y orales. Me costó mucho apartar mis ojos de mi bebé para mirar a Josh quien tenía una mirada de adoración a nosotros. Lágrimas en sus ojos. Abracé a mi pequeñito para abrigarlo. – Ya eres padre, Josh. Me miró totalmente embobado. – Soy padre de una hermosa niña. Gracias, Alex. No me había dado cuenta de que había dicho el sexo de mi nena. El doctor llamó a Josh para cortar el cordón umbilical pero inmediatamente regresó a nosotras. - Hora de nacimiento 4h03 am. APGAR 9 al minuto. – Dijo la pediatra. - Lista extracción placentaria. – Escuché decir al obstetra. Nosotros seguíamos embobados en nuestra pequeña, que se había calmado. Yo acariciaba su espaldita por debajo de la toallita con quien la calentaba y Josh acariciaba su cabecita, a pesar de que ya le había colocado un gorro. - Cárgala, Josh. – Mi esposo obedeció justo a tiempo antes de que otra gran contracción me atravesara. - Encajó perfectamente, Alexandra. – Dijo el obstetra y no pude estar más que feliz, siempre había el riesgo de cambio de posición**. – Empieza a pujar cuando quieras y mantén sostenida la contracción. Josh había entregado a nuestra pequeña al pediatra quien continúo con el procedimiento rutinario. Entrelazó nuevamente nuestros dedos y besó mi frente, susurrándome un \"te amo\" al oído. Nuevamente un gran dolor me atravesó mientras pujaba. Solté la contracción y volví a tomar aire para rápidamente volver a pujar y no dejé de hacerlo hasta que escuché el llanto de mi bebé. Abrí mis ojos llenos de lágrimas, por el dolor y por la emoción. De la misma manera que en mi niña, colocaron el nuevo bebé en mi vientre mientras lo calentaban y succionaban. Mi esposo besó mis labios y acarició a nuestro pequeño. - ¿Qué es? – Preguntó a la otra pediatra que ahora atendía a este bebé. - Es un hermoso varoncito. No podía creerlo. Nuestros mellizos habían llegado al mundo ya. Una hermosa nena y un hermoso varón. Por suerte estábamos preparado para ello. Cuando nos dijeron que tendríamos 2 bebes decidimos no saber el sexo. Habíamos preparado ropa para niño y niña cubriendo todas las posibilidades. Fue un alivio que fuera mellizos, ya que un embarazo gemelar siempre tenía más riesgos. Pero ahora nada importaba, porque ambos estaban sanos, según los pediatras. Luego de la extracción de la segunda placenta, de un examen ginecológico para evitar complicaciones y del terrible masaje para asegurar el globo de seguridad de pinard**, me pasaron a una sala de observación. Josh estuvo a mi lado todo el tiempo. – Deberías ir a avisarles a todos que estamos bien. - No quiero separarme de ti. – En sus ojos había tanta adoración que no me sentía merecedora. - No me pasará nada. Los pequeños tendrán que pasar por un motón de protocolos y en una hora a más tardar me pasaran a una habitación con ellos. Los demás deben estar ansiosos. No merecen estar tan preocupados. - Está bien. – Dijo a regañientes. Empezó a ir hacia la salida cuando regresó rápidamente sorprendiéndome con un intenso beso. – Te amo. - Te amo. Estaba tan cansada que me quedé dormida, desperté cuando ambos pediatras y mi obstetra llegaron con mis bebés. Me felicitaron por mi actitud valiente en el parto, por mis bebes sanos quien a pesar de ser levemente prematuros** no tuvieron ninguna dificultad y serán dados de alta muy pronto. Cuando se fueron no pude evitar observarlos detenidamente. Mis angelitos eran preciosos. No podía asegurar a quién se parecía cada uno, pero estaba seguro de que no podría haberme enamorado tan rápido de nadie como lo hice de mis hijos. Ya en mi habitación toda mi familia entró como una manada de animales para conocer a los nuevos integrantes. Todos estaban llenos de júbilo al conocerlos, y no se diga de Josh que no se separaba más de 5 minutos de sus hijos o de mí. Así comenzó nuestra nueva vida de padres, una vida muy, pero muy ajetreada pero maravillosa. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O Un sonido de llanto resonó en la oscuridad. Estaba muy, pero muy cansada. Mi mente estaba despierta pero mi cuerpo no quería salir de la cama. Otra vez el sonido de llanto inundó el silencio, haciendo que me removiera incómoda. Esperaba que mi querido esposo se levantara por la nena para no tener que dejar mi deliciosa cama. Y el llanto se volvió mas fuerte, ya que mi pequeña caprichosa estaba acostumbrada a que no le ignoremos. Me revolví en las sábanas y Josh empezó a roncar. Rápidamente descubrí que estaba despierto y que solamente fingía. A decir verdad, él no roncaba, pero yo solía molestarlo con eso hasta que se convenció de ello. Me acurruqué contra Josh aún con los ojos cerrados y empecé a juguetear con su abdomen suavemente, como si fuera accidental. Bajé por su ombligo hasta llegar al pequeño Josh quien saltó bajo mi toque. Tuve que retener una risita cuando el rostro de Josh se contrajo bajo mi toqué. Abrió los ojos de golpe cuando agarré a su amiguito y este practicamente vibró. Gruñó, pero se levantó de la cama rápidamente para ir por nuestra pequeña. - Mas te vale estar desnuda cuando regrese. Me eché a reír. Habíamos echo un trato sobre quién atendería a la bebé. Habíamos quedado que quien se despertara, es decir, quien abriera los ojos tendría que ir a su cuidado. Así que había usado una sucia estrategia. Josh volvió con nuestra pequeña Emily en sus brazos. Apenas tenía 6 meses y aún no se acostumbraba a dormir en su habitación. Me acomodé hasta lograr sentarme para recibir a mi pequeña hambrienta en los brazos. Empecé a a amantarla mientras acariciabia sus pequeños rizos, eso solía relajarla. Levanté mi mirada para encontrarme con la de mi marido en nosotrosas. – Podía mirarlas todo el día. Son preciosas. Dos gotas de agua. Era verdad, Emily tenía mucho parecido a mí, su tez morena con sus rizos negros alborotados y sus ojos tan oscuros como los míos. - ¿Y los pequeños? – Pregunté porque sabía que él siempre revisaba a los otros pequeños. - Christian se quedó dormido abrazado a Rixon y Kristin se ríe dormida por lo que supongo que tiene un buen sueño. – Mis pequeños mellizos tenía 3 años. Había sido todo un desafío cuidarlos pero la madre de Josh estuvo a mi lado todo el tiempo para ayudarme. - Esta niña tambien se durmió. ¿Quieres dejarla en su cuna o prefieres que se quede con nosotros hasta el amanecer? – Eran las 6h30 am. - La cuna, quiero mucho a mi princesa pero tengo que cobrar una deuda a cierta pequeña tramposa por despertarme de una manera muy sucia. Se apresuró a tomar a la niña y a dejarla en su habitación. Yo aproveché para quitar mi pijama, que usábamos por el frío de la temporada, para recibirlo. Practicamente saltó sobre mí y me regaló un beso que hizo que todas mis células se estremecieran. - Nunca me cansaré de ti, me tienes completamente loco. - Mucho bla bla y poca acción, Hutcherson. Aprovecha el tiempo. Nos fundimos en nuestra loca lujuria. Podían pasar los años pero seguíamos deseándonos el uno al otro como al inicio. Cuando hablabamos de hacer el amor eramos un manojo de hormonas y sentimientos. Llegamos al éxtasis con un \"te amo\" de ambos antes de ir por otra ronda. Y otra… Y otra… O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O Un sujeto se acomodó en el asiento de atrás. Tenía una grasiento hot-dog, podía percibir su cubierta grasienta hasta aquí. Iba a vomitar. - ¿Estás bien? – Preguntó Michelle. – Te pusiste un poco verde. - Estoy bien. – Traté de inhalar un poco de aire puro. - ¿Segura? – Tenía el rostro preocupado. Mis pequeños mellizos empezaron a gemir en sus asientos en busca de atención. - Queremos cola, mami.- Dijo Christian. - ¿Puedes llevarlos? – Pregunté a Michelle. La verdad era que temía ponerme de pie y desmayarme. - Claro. Vamos pequeños. – Tomó a cada uno de la mano. - ¿Te traigo algo? - Solo agua. Apenas se fueron el equipo volvió a la cancha luego de su descanso. Era el último tiempo, e ibamos empatando. - Papi. – Señaló mi chiquita Emily. La tomé de su asiento para colocarla en mi regazo. Ella se desvivía por su padre y él la mimaba demasiado. Agitó sus manitos para saludar a su padre que estaba listo para jugar. Miró hacia nosotros y envió varios besos voladores. Era un maldito coqueto. La audiencia fanática de él emitió varios suspiros. Josh, como todos los años, jugaba un partido en apoyo para su fundación SBNN y todas nuestra \"pequeña familia\" vino al partido. El árbitro dio inicio al juego y no pude evitar gritar en apoyo a mi esposo. Incluso dije una mala palabra al miembro de otro equipo que le dio un codazo a mi chico. - Tranquila, Alex. Me sorprendí por la voz que me parecía conocida pero no podía reconocerla. Giré para encontrarme con un muy viejo amigo. – PABLO. Coloqué a mi pequeña en su asiento antes de envolverlo en mis brazos. – Es bueno verte, pequeña. - Digo lo mismo, vaya… - dije examinándolo de pies a cabeza. – Te ves genial. Era verdad, cuando pensaba en Pablo solo recordaba a un chico alto y delgado que parecía más a un adolescente. Ahora es todo un hombre, un cuerpo grueso y bien formado y una barba muy profesional. - Tú sigues siendo la misma hermosa chica de siempre. – No pude evitar sonrojarme. – Vamos, no estoy coqueteado contigo… bueno si, lo hago pero es por la costumbre, sé que estás casada. Miró hacia Josh. - Sí, estoy felizmente casada. Pablo se inclinó para saludar a mi pequeña quien le ofreció su manito. Mi pequeña educada. – Es preciosa, muy parecida a ti, debo decir. - Gracias, en realidad tengo 2 pequeños más. Se echó a reír. – No pensé que Hutcherson tenía madera de padre. - En realidad, si fuera por él, cada año tuvieramos uno. – Y era verdad. Pero a favor de Josh, la idea no me sonaba descabellada. - Sabía que terminarías con él. - ¿En serio? – Estaba sorprendida, despues de todo Josh había interferido en los intentos de Pablo para conquistarme. - Lo supe totalmente, desde la vez que nos interrumpió diciendo que era tarde y eso que aún no lo conocía, simplemente me di cuenta que estaba celoso y cuando lo veía mirarte, te veía como el mayor tesoro, con completa adoración y cuando nos abordó en nuestra cita ya no era el único que veía al otro de una manera diferente. Tú estabas enamorada de él. - No es cierto. – Me quejé. – En aquel entonces apenas lo conocía, no podía estar enamorada. - Pues lo estabas y no te dabas cuentas. Me quedé pensando en sus palabras y dirigí mi mirada a mi chico justo cuando metió una canasta, giró a mirarme y sonrío, luego sus labios formaron una linea tensa. Su mirada estaba fija en Pablo, quien tenía su brazo en mi hombro. Mi pequeño celoso. El pitido que anunciaba el fin del partido sonó y Josh practicamento corrió hacia nosotros ignorando por completo a la fanaticada. En el mismo momento regresaron mis pequeños con mi suegra. Los mellizos corrienron hacia su papá quien los alzo en sus brazos. Llegó a mi lado con una sonrisa cautelosa. – Hola, mi vida. – y aunque sus manos estaban ocupadas, pudo encerrarme en un posesivo beso. - Josh, ¿recuerdas a Pablo? – Dijé señalando a mi viejo amigo. Lo miró de pies y cabeza por un buen momento hasta que pudo recordar. Y su rostro se tensó aún más. – Tranquilo, Josh, solo me acerqué a saludar a mi vieja amiga, me alegra mucho verla tan feliz a tu lado. Las palabras fueron sinceras, por lo que Josh no tuvo otro remedio que relajarse. Desde ahí en adelante todo fue bien. Hablamos sobre las cosas que hemos hecho en los últimos años. Incluso le invitamos a cenar a nuestra casa. Ya en la noche nos preparabamos para ir a la cama. Mañana sería otro día muy ajetreado. - Fue bueno verlo. – Dijo Josh. – Me gustó aclararle que yo fue quién ganó tu corazón. – No sabía que era una competencia. – Odiaba los comentarios en los que yo terminaba siendo un objeto. – No lo era y sin embargo fui el ganador. – Abrazó mi cintura y empezó a besar mis hombros. Me deje caer contra su pecho. – Tú siempre serás mi trofeo y nuestra familia mi mejor premio. Si he hecho algo importante en esta vida es haber logrado tener tu corazón y tener a esos pequeños. Son lo mejor que tengo, son mi mejor regalo. – Él es un gran chico, creo que nuestra relación hubiera ido bien. Un gruñido y una mordida al lóbulo de mi oreja, después empezó a pasear sus manos por mi vientre. – Ni siquiera acepto la idea. Tú siempre serás mía, siempre estuviste destinada para mí. Sus manos masajearon mis senos. – Además ningún hombre te haría sentir como yo, pequeña lujuriosa. Me volteó para atacar mis labios, su lengua rápidamente se abrió paso, logrando que mis sentidos se rindieran ante él. No pude evitar dejar escapar muchos gemidos. – Tengo que ir a revisar a Emily. – Susurré. Mi aliento no podía emitir más que un leve sonido. – Ella duerme, al igual que Kristin y Christian, y… cuando los niños duermen, los papis juegan. – Me gusta jugar. – Mordí su labio inferior. – Eres muy traviesa, mi pequeña lujuriosa. Y maldita sea si no amo eso de ti. Me tienes como un tren. No hicieron falta más palabras porque lo empujé sobre la cama para iniciar nuestro juego favorito. O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O*-*O No era la primera vez que había asistido a una premiere de Hollywood con Josh y sin embargo, aún no me acostumbraba a la cantidad de atención sobre mí. Esta ocasión era muy especial, y mi esposo estaba muy nervioso por la nominación como MEJOR ACTOR. Algo dentro de mí decía que ganaría ese Oscar, se lo merecía completamente. Además, me convenía que estuviera de buen humor para la noticia que tendría que darle luego. - Sabes que estás completamente hermosa con ese vestido. Un diseñador me había convencido para usar este salvaje vestido rojo. Iniciaba alrededor de mi cuello para caer delicadamente en un escote que llegaba hasta abdomen, mostrando la piel entre mi busto; no tenía espalda y la falda era larga con un apretura en mi pierna izquierda que llegaba muy arriba de mi muslo. Me sentía un poco fuera de mi ambiente pero tenía que aceptar que lucía sexy. – Me alegra que después de 3 hijos pudiera entrar en algo como esto. – Siempre serás la chica más sexy que he conocido. – Su aliento en mi cuello me estaba haciendo perder la conciencia. – Aunque tengas 10 hijos más, lo que por cierto quiero. Me perdí en su mirada. Tomé un respiro. – Tengo algo que decirte. Josh, yo… – GANASTE, JOSH. – El grito de Avan nos sorprendió. Ninguno de los dos entendía que diablos quería decir. – Sube, Josh. Ve a recibir tu premio. Un segundo después me di cuenta de que Josh había ganado un Oscar y que lo había mostrado en las pantallas durante las nominaciones y no nos habíamos dado cuenta porque estábamos en un momento íntimo. Qué vergüenza. Josh me dio un largo beso antes de dirigirse al escenario. La presentadora bromeó disculpándose con Josh por habernos interrumpido. De seguro, yo estaba más roja que mi vestido. Josh tomó su premio y empezó con su discurso agradeciendo a toda su familia, amigos y todos quienes estuvieron en el rodaje y quienes vieron la película. – Sinceramente, esto no podría estar sucediendo si no fuera por ellos. Estoy muy orgulloso por este galardón casi tanto como el orgullo que siento por mi hermosa esposa y mis pequeños. Muchos Awws se escucharon y la presentadora volvió a bromear. – Todos fuimos testigos de la devoción a tu esposa. Tenía la intención de presentar otro premio antes de interrumpirte. Creo que todos tuvimos un vistazo de amor verdadero. – Hubiera preferido que pases a otro premio, en verdad. – Pero si solo falta, MEJOR PELÍCULA, esa es la más importante de la noche. – Todos reían ante sus bromas. – Lo siento por pensar así, pero tengo mis razones y mis prioridades. Mi hermosa esposa, Alexandra. – me señaló. – Estaba a punto de confesarme que está nuevamente embarazada de dos pequeñuelos. Me lo ha estado ocultando durante días ¿Puedes imaginarlo? Todo mundo empezó aplaudir y yo quedé con la boca abierta. Maldito. Me había preocupado tanto en buscar la manera de darle esta noticia y él ya la sabía. – Lo siento, mi amor, llamaron del obstetra para decir que habías olvidado tus vitaminas prenatales y luego encontré tu ecografía. Quería que me lo dijeras, pero estabas demorando. – Luego se dirigió al público. – Este sin duda, es de los mejores días de mi vida. Gracias por el premio. Los aplausos sin duda resonaron y aunque inmediatamente anunciaron la ganadora de MEJOR PELÍCULA DEL AÑO, todos estaban encantados con Josh y nuestro anuncio. – Te voy a matar. – Dije cuando se sentó a mi lado con una sonrisa engreída. – No querrás dejar a tus pequeños huérfanos y menos a ellos que aún no me conocen. – Su mano acarició mi vientre. – Vamos a ser padres de nuevo y estoy tan feliz por ello. Cada día me vuelvo a preguntar si puedo amarte aún más de lo que ya lo hago y cada día descubro que te amo mil veces más. – No eres el único que se enamora más a diario. Siempre serás tú el dueño de mi corazón y la única persona con quién quiero escribir mi historia. – Nuestra historia sería muy… enredada. – Sujetó mi mano para entrelazar nuestros dedos y volver a colocarlos sobre mi vientre. – No considero que es una novela, sería más como poesía o una canción. – ¿Una enredada canción? – Dijo sonriente. –Sí, sin duda: Una Enredada Canción de Amor. Sus labios sobre los míos son todo lo que necesito. Miro sus ojos y no puedo hacer nada más que dar gracias. Gracias por tenerlo, gracias por amarlo y gracias porque él me ama. He aprendido varias cosas, entre ellas que vale la pena seguir aunque sea duro, porque con los bellos momentos se aprende que aunque las lágrimas nos puedan ensuciar el rostro, también nos limpian el corazón. Ahora se que hay cosas por las que merece la pena vivir la vida. Fin.

Este embarazo me estaba maltratando demasiado. Los pequeños eran grandes y no me dejan descansar con sus constantes movimientos. Amaba la sensación de vida dentro de mí pero sinceramente quería que ya salieran. Por lo menos ya no tenía nauseas, ya solo era mucho cansancio. El horno emitió un sonido y me apresuré a sacar la carne para la cena. Me costó agacharme y me costó enderezarme nuevamente sin apoyo ya que mis manos estaban ocupadas. – Deja eso, Alex. – Michelle se apresuró a quitarme de las manos la cacerola. – Tienes que descansar, niña, no estás en condiciones de ajetrearte mucho. – Me siento como una inútil. – Mi suegra ha estado cuidando de mí estas últimas semanas desde que mi obstetra pidió que repose. Tuve amenaza de parto prematuro, por suerte solo eran contracciones y no hubo ruptura de membranas. El tratamiento fue eficaz pero el descanso fue la primera orden del médico. – Nada de eso. Para eso estoy aquí, para cuidar de ti y mis nietos. – Si tan solo pudiera trabajar… – Ni se lo menciones a Josh. – Sabía exactamente cómo reaccionaría Josh si le decía la idea. Josh me había obligado a pedir una licencia por mi condición aunque traté de convencerlo que solo daría consulta y estaría prácticamente todo el día sentada. Cada vez que quería tocar el tema terminábamos enfadados y peor aún lograba hacerme sentir culpable porque él solo se preocupa por mí y nuestros niños. – Me siento inútil, me siento como un estorbo y me siento horrible. – Las lágrimas empezaban a picar en mis ojos. Ninguno de mis anteriores embarazos me había sentido tan deprimida como en este. Me sentía una completa inútil porque ni siquiera podía cuidar de mi esposo y mis niños, aunque amaba a mi suegra no era correcto que fuera ella quién se haga cargo de MI HOGAR. La dejé sola en la cocina porque no quería que me viera llorar. De la forma más rápida que pude moverme me apresuré a mi habitación y cerré la puerta. Me dejé caer contra la puerta mientras las lágrimas inevitablemente rodaban por mis mejillas. Dos golpes en la puerta. – Alex… ¿Estás bien? – Lo estoy. – Dije lo más serenamente posible. – No quiero cenar, solo me iré a dormir. – No es bueno que no cenes. – Solo quiero dormir, por favor, Michelle. Debió notar que no daría mi brazo a torcer. – Esta bien, cualquier cosa que necesites, llámame. Me quedé ahí un momento más, con el rostro escondido entre mis piernas. Mi postura disminuía el espacio para mis pequeños que no tardaron en retorcerse dentro de mí. Ni siquiera había pensado en ellos. Soy una mala madre. Logré ponerme de pie y decidí dormir. Me quite la ropa que usaba, ya nada me quedaba, todo eran pantalones y camisetas deportivas anchas, muchas ellas de Josh, pero eran lo único que podía ponerme. Me miré al espejo. Mi piel de mi rostro estaba llena de manchas, mis senos se desbordaban de mi sujetador, mi vientre enorme estaba lleno de estrías que parecía en cualquier momento se rompería. Dichas manchas blancas habían invadido mis muslos y mi trasero. Era un completo desastre, estaba horrible, eso explicaría porque Josh ya no quiere hacerme el amor. ¿Quién podría desearme? Ya no quería llorar, siempre que lloraba tenía luego jaqueca y por mi embarazo no podía tomar la medicación que me calmaba. Me vestí y me metí bajo las mantas tratando de dormir aunque era demasiado pronto para ello. Podía escuchar a mis tres pequeños corretear fuera de la habitación. No quería que me vieran de esta manera, soy su mamá y debo brindarles lo mejor de este mundo, no llenarlos de preocupaciones por mi situación. Me debí quedar dormida, porque empecé a volver en mí cuando unos pequeños toques acariciaban mi frente. Abrí mis ojos para encontrarme con la mirada de Josh y una sonrisa triste. – Mi mamá dijo que no te sentías bien y debía dejarte dormir, pero no pude evitar tocarte cuando tu rostro hace todas esas muecas. Siempre me ha cautivado verte dormir, podría pasar horas solo mirándote. – No pude evitar sonreír, aunque fue una triste sonrisa. – ¿Puedes decirme lo que sucede? No dije ninguna palabra. No quería decirle lo que él ya sabía, que me había convertido en bulto nada útil, que era una desgracia como madre y como mujer. Como no respondí, él se quitó su ropa y de un salto se metió bajo las mantas al otro lado. Me atrajo a su cuerpo y sus brazos se envolvieron sobre mi vientre. Después de todo este tiempo su contacto era liberador. Podía pasar mi vida envuelta en sus brazos, hacer de almohada su pecho y percibir su aroma. Los latidos de su corazón eran fuertes pero calmados, me envolvían de paz y anhelo. Sus labios se posaron en mi frente, recordándome lo dulce que era y las cosas que me hacían amarlo cada día más. – Te amo. – Sentí que debía decírselo en este momento. Él era todo lo que necesitaba y todo lo que quería. Él me hacía feliz y dichosa, me hacía querer vivir y me hacía sentirme viva. No sé qué sería de mí si lo perdiera. – Te amo también, Alex. – Logró hacerme girar hasta que nuestras miradas conectaran. – Debería decírtelo más a menudo. – Lo dices todos los días cuando nos despedimos. – Sonreí. – Lo sé pero es una costumbre decírtelo de despedida, aunque eso no quita que se verdad. Debería decirlo de una manera diferente, como la primera vez que te dije, mostrándote que cada palabra sale de mi corazón. – ¿Aún me amas como cuando nos conocimos? – Nunca mi voz debió sonar tan insegura. – No, te amo más. Cada día me enamoro un poco más de ti, pienso que nadie podría amar tanto como yo lo hago y cada día descubro que estoy equivocado. Suavemente acerqué mis labios a los suyos, disfrutando cada momento y cada sensación. Entendía lo que decía, cada día mis sentimientos por él se hacían más grandes, cada día me daba cuenta que no podía concebir mi vida sin él y nuestros pequeños. – Quiero saber lo que tienes, Alex. No sabes lo mucho que me lastima verte llorar y no poder hacer nada para solucionar lo que te tiene mal. – Apartó un mechón de mi cabello. – Si tú no estás bien, yo tampoco lo estoy. Eres la mitad de mi corazón… y si una parte de él no funciona bien solo soy un enfermo más. ¿Cómo poder negarme a algo que él me pide si me mira como si fuera lo más maravilloso del universo? – Yo… - Me era difícil aceptar lo que tenía que decir. – Tú… – No hago nada bien, Josh. Siento… siento que soy una inútil, que ni siquiera puedo cuidar de ustedes que son lo que más amo. Ya ni siquiera soy lo suficientemente mujer para que me desees a todas horas…. – Alto. – En algún momento había empezado a llorar. Los dedos de Josh se posaron en mis labios. – Alexandra, eres una madre abnegada que se desvive por dar lo mejor de sí a sus pequeños, eres una gran profesional y una gran persona. No eres una inútil. Simplemente tienes que descansar, por tu bien y el de los pequeños. Admito que quizás te he abrumado con todos mis cuidados, es solo que no puedo arriesgarme a que algo te sucediera. – No me va a pasar nada… – No. Espero que no. – El dolor en su voz me hizo sentir culpable por preocuparlo de esa manera. – Y olvida eso de que no te deseo. Si por mí fuera estaría dentro de ti todo el tiempo. No sabes lo mucho que me ha costado no tocarte y más ahora cuando luces tan bella con esta pancita y ese brillo especial en los ojos. He comprobado que soy un hombre demasiado fuerte. – Pues no me has tocado en un buen tiempo. – Necesitaba tanto su contacto. – No hablo de sexo, pareciera que tuvieras miedo de tocarme. – Tengo miedo de empezar y no poder detenerme. El doctor dijo que no podíamos tener sexo. – A mí no me dijo nada. – Murmuré. – Es por las prostaglindanas. Me eché a reír. – Prostaglandinas – Me di cuenta que lo que decía Josh era irrefutable y verídico. – No creo que el doctor te explicara ello. – En realidad dijo: \"No sexo, no se discute\" así que me dediqué a buscar la razón porque si no la encontraba definitivamente no iba a privarme de estar contigo. En internet encontré información que decía que el semen del hombre tienen prostaglandinas y esas cosas pueden desencadenar contracciones y por lo tanto parto. – Así es. Por eso prohíben el sexo en el último trimestre. – Por eso nos lo prohibieron ahora. Ahora con la cabeza fría y con las palabras de Josh me sentía calmada y al mismo tiempo tonta por no recordar aquello. – Pensé que era porque me encontrabas horrorosa. Mírame, soy un desastre llena de manchas y estrías, ya no tengo una figura bonita que puedas adorar, ni puedo usar maquillaje para verme bonita. – Ningún maquillaje te hará lucir más hermosa de lo que eres. Puede que no recuperes esa figura exuberante o que tu piel tenga marcas pero siempre serás la mujer más preciosa que existe. Todos esos problemas han sido por tener a nuestros pequeños y no sabes lo orgulloso que me siento de que los hayas tenido sabiendo lo que podía pasar. – Sus manos empezaron a masajear mis senos. – Siempre serás sexy y siempre te desearé porque estar contigo, hacer el amor contigo, no se compara con nada del mundo. – Me siento como una tonta. – Pues eres mi tontita. – Se cernió sobre mí con cuidado de mi vientre. – Ahora déjame besarte, no me importa si luego me siento frustrado por no tenerte, solo quiero que sepas que nunca dejaré de amarte. Me besó y se sintió abrasador. Volvía a sentirme deseada y amada. Había sido una tonta por llenarme de inseguridades pero es algo lógico cuando temes no ser suficiente y perder lo que más quieres. – Tengo algo para ti. – Josh se apresuró por su saco y extrajo una caja. Con cuidado la abrió revelando un collar con una gran dije redondo con grabado en forma de lirio. – Es hermoso. No debías comprarme nada. – En realidad tenía preparado llevarte a cenar fuera, un paseo en medio de la noche y una sesión de besuqueos. – ¿Algo que festejar? – En realidad sí, mi despistada esposa. En pocos minutos será San Valentín y festejaremos 5 años de nuestra boda. Era tu regalo de aniversario. Me sentí tan estúpida al no recordar la fecha y me hacía amarlo aún más que él recordara. – Lo siento por arruinar la sorpresa. Yo… no tengo nada para ti. – Estar a tu lado cada día es un regalo. Solo quería recordar el día más feliz de mi vida, pero todo queda en segundo lugar cuando se trata de ti. No has arruinado nada, prefiero tener este momento, hace mucho que no hemos estado verdaderamente solos, que no podido dedicarme a escucharte como debiera, ni siquiera he podido consentirte. – Tú me consientes demasiado. – Eso le hizo sonreír. – Hago todo un drama y tú ni siquiera te molestas. – No digas eso, no puedo enfadarme contigo. – Tomó el collar entre sus manos y las depositó en las mías. – Ábrelo. No había notado que era un guardapelo. Con cuidado encontré un broche y la abrí revelando dos fotos de Josh y yo. Una foto en la que yo estaba en sus brazos, ambos mirándonos embobados. – Fue la primera foto que nos tomamos, aparte de las del comercial. – De alguna manera nunca me había fijado en aquellas fotos, ahora que lo veo, teníamos la mirada de amor. Ya en esa época estábamos locos el uno por el otro aunque ni nosotros mismo lo notáramos. La otra foto fue en aquel partido de fútbol, la primera foto de novios. – Aún recuerdo estar frustrado porque tu atención estaba en el juego y no en mí. – Fue la primera vez que hablaste de tener niños y que debían gustarles el baloncesto. – Ahora tendré mi propio equipo. – Cerró el guardapelo y me lo colgó alrededor del cuello. – No quiero imaginarme como reaccionarás si no les gusta el baloncesto. – Seré un entrenador frustrado pero igualmente los amaré con todo mi corazón, casi tanto como amo a su hermosa madre. Acaricié su rostro disfrutando la sensación. – Eres todo lo que quiero. – Y siempre seré lo que deseas y necesitas. – Juntó nuestras frentes apenas rozando nuestros labios. – Sabía que los príncipes azules no existen, pero por ti estoy dispuesto a pintarme de azul si eso te hace feliz, todo por quedarme contigo la eternidad. Lo amaba mucho más que hace unos segundos. Ambos buscábamos ser lo que él otro necesitaba sin darnos cuentas que éramos eso y todo lo que queríamos. El pitido de su reloj anunció la media noche. – Feliz San Valentín, amor. – Dije contra sus labios. – Feliz Aniversario, vida. – Sus dientes atraparon mi labio inferior. – Apenas son cinco años pero siento que ha sido toda una vida. – No imagino otra forma de pasar mis días si no es contigo. Después de todas estas horribles semanas me siento en paz. Envuelta por sus brazos en medio de la noche, escuchando el latido de su corazón en mi oído, sé que este es y siempre será mi sitio ideal. – Tengo que contarte algo – dijo de repente, su voz era seria – Quiero saber qué opinas, no he aceptado porque no sé cómo te sientas respecto a ello. – ¿Es sobre el nuevo proyecto? – Si. – Se sentó frente a mí mirándome fijamente. – Hoy me informaron sobre el elenco que ya confirmó… Shannon está entre ellos. Escuchar su nombre dolió. Abrió una herida que aún estaba allí, ya no sentía traición solo sentía ira por lo que ella hizo. No encontraba las palabras adecuadas, no me gustaba la idea. – ¿Qué piensas? ¿Debo llamar y renunciar? – No. – Aunque no la quiero cerca de él ni por 100kms. – Confío en ti. – ¿Si ella intenta algo? ¿Confiarás en ella? He cometido un millar de horrores en mi vida por desconfianza e inseguridades, es el momento de ser madura y mostrar que no dudo ni un segundo de su amor. Es quizás la única manera de cerrar un capítulo inconcluso y una herida vieja. – Me importa una mierda lo que ella intenté. Confío en ti, son tus decisiones y sé que me amas y nunca harías nada para dañar lo que tenemos. Si ella intenta besarte o seducirte, la mandas al diablo y te alejas. No se trata de lo que ella haga, solo es una piedra en el camino que ya sobrepasamos, todo esto es acerca de mí confiando en ti y haciéndote saber que sé lo seguro que está mi corazón en tus manos. Me apretó fuertemente contra él. Sentí un ligero tirón en mi vientre. – Eres… eres maravillosa. Me dejé besar un momento más. Volví a sentir un tirón más fuerte. –Basta de halagos, es hora de acción. – No podemos. – dijo sonriente. – No hablaba de ese tipo de acción. – Señalé envolviendo mis manos en mi vientre. Ahora entendía porque mi espalda me había dolido más durante todo el día. – Trae el auto, Josh. Tus regalitos están en camino. No tenía miedo. No como la primera vez. Sabía que todo estaría bien. Se puso pálido y se apresuró por mis cosas. Lo vi correr de un lado al otro en la casa asegurándose que nuestros pequeños estén bien e indicándole a Michelle lo que sucedía. Me colocó una bata abrigada y me cargó en sus brazos hasta el coche. Condujo todo lo rápido que pudo hasta la puerta del hospital. Apenas estacionó, volvió a ponerme en sus brazos a pesar de que yo le recordé que tenía piernas y podía caminar. Justo antes de que ingresemos a maternidad, atraje su rostro para un beso. – Estoy segura de que amarán el baloncesto. – Besé su mejilla. – Feliz San Valentín, cariño.
