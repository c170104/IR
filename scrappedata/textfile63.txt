I know this is a stretch for a story, but just go with it, please? I came up with the idea after watching the movie trailer for \"Guardian: Cemeteries and their Sentinels\" which is a new book project by Angi Sullins and Silas Toball. It can be found at www(dot)duirwaighgallery(dot)com as well as other inspirational videos, and mystical and fantastical works of art by many great artists. WARNING: This is not a happy story, and there is a character death. To me, this story symbolizes the end of my writing fanfiction for The Net. It's time to move on to bigger and better things and no one seems interested in anything else I've written for this show recently. I'm still thinking about writing the sequel to Still Running, entitled I'll Be Your Angel but that will probably be my last piece. If anyone wants me to work on it, let me know! Otherwise, newer projects, namely fanfic for CSI, will take precedence. I welcome all comments, except flames, and I would love to hear what you think! If you stop by to read this, please don't walk away from it without posting your thoughts. I need to know that what I'm doing here for one of my most favorite shows is appreciated. Thank you! And I'm sorry this A/N was so long. Here's the story. I hope you like it. âœ¢ Jacob awoke with a start. Feeling soft grass under his hands he slowly got to his feet. Looking around, he realized it was nighttime and no moon was out. His brain felt as if it had been in a deep fog for a long time and he shook his head to clear it. Events and people he knew came whooshing back to him. \"Where am I?\" he asked himself, turning around where he stood, wary of walking anywhere least he bump into something. \"Angel?\" he called. Remembering her beautiful face, her angelic voice, his heart hurt not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. He prayed that she was ok, wherever she was. He hoped Sean hadn't finally gotten her. \"Angel?\" he called again, louder, uncertainty filling his voice as he began to worry that something had gone terribly wrong. \"A light might help,\" came a deep voice from the darkness Jacob didn't recognize. A light appeared, bright, white, held aloft in a man's raised hand high above his head of silvery grey hair. He was wearing a long white cloak, a hood running down the back. He looked at Jacob. \"Do you recognize where you are now?\" he asked. Jacob looked around again, now able to see headstones lined up in neat rows. In the distance he could barely make out a few old trees and several statues amongst the graves. He turned back to the man, a feeling of horror coming over him. \"Who are you? And what happened to Angela? Where is she?\" \"I am called The Messenger,\" the man said. \"I was sent from Heaven to tell you what happened.\" \"What? What do you mean? This doesn't make sense. Is it Halloween? Is this some kind of sick joke?\" \"This is no joke Jacob Gabriel Resh!\" The Messenger almost seemed angry before his features softened and he continued, \"Do you remember the last battle with the Praetorians?\" Jacob's mind flooded with the memories: He and Angela had been in his basement working, to find the Praetorians while his Nana baked chocolate chip cookies in the kitchen upstairs. It wasn't supposed to go down like it did. They were supposed to find the Praetorian Headquarters, but instead the Praetorians had finally located Sorcerer. His computer system warned him that it had been hacked. Angela made a quick call to Mariano while Jacob tried to divert the hack. But time didn't afford them anything and Jacob was glad Mariano had furnished them with guns the last time they'd met. He heard Nana call his name in a frantic voice before bullets rang out and he knew she was gone. The Praetorians came down hard and swift with no mercy. Jacob and Angela hardly had time to reach for weapons and cover themselves. When Mariano and his men finally arrived all hell broke loose and Jacob was separated from Angela. Looking up from dealing a death blow to a Praetorian, he saw Sean Trelawney with his gun aimed at Angela, ready to fire. Jacob screamed her name and ran for her with all of his strength and will. He dove into her, knocking her to the ground just before Trelawney pulled his trigger. She wasn't moving as he covered her body with his own and sent a return shot in Sean's direction, watching the man fall to the ground. The rest of his memory was blank. \"She's dead?\" he asked The Messenger, not wanting to believe it was true. \"Have a look at yourself.\" Confused, Jacob looked down at his hands. They were so pale he could see the grass beneath his feet through them. His wide eyes sought The Messenger's and the cloaked man pointed toward a gravestone next to Jacob. He turned and read: Jacob Gabriel Resh 1981-1999 \" The best Sorcerer an Angel could ever want.\" \"I'm dead,\" Jacob tried to come to grips with the news, but couldn't. \"Where's Angela? What happened?\" \"You saved her life and she's been watching over you ever since.\" The Messenger shined his light higher and Jacob saw two stone hands resting on his tombstone. A robed and hooded stone figure stood behind his tomb, her head bowed, strands of hair falling out. Around her waist, a sheath had been buckled, a grand sword at her side. Bending down on one knee to see her face, a lump formed in Jacob's throat. She held an expression of resolute will and a softer expression of eternal sadness. \"Angel?\" he whispered. The features were so much like her that Jacob's heart began to crack at the fear that coursed through him. \"Tell me she survived them,\" he begged the cloaked man behind him. \"She did. Angela Marie Bennett is her sole identity now. She came to visit you everyday for the first six months after the fight.\" Jacob's eyes widened again. \"She did?\" \"Everyday. But during one of her visits the graveyard's Gatekeeper told her about the Seven Guardian Stars aligning and how other tombstones came to have Guardians.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jacob asked, finally prying his eyes away from the statue at his grave and turning back to The Messenger. \"I know this might be hard to understand, but after death some people have Guardians to protect them while they rest. It's usually for the Guardian, because they can't stand to be parted from a loved one.\" Jacob looked back at Angela and wondered how this stone figure had come to be here, at his grave, looking like her. Had she really, actually loved him? Was this really her? \"A simple ritual is done. Angela came to the church and asked to be your Guardian.\" \"MY Guardian?\" Jacob was surprised. \"She said that the great Sorcerer needed a Guardian she was the one for the job. I got her the robes and sword she would need. I taught her how to used that sword. She practiced hard with dedication everyday before and after visiting you for another six months. She made sure she was ready by the first night of the alignment. And she was. She's more deadly with that sword than anyone else I've taught,\" The Messenger paused, as if remembering their swordsmanship classes together. He continued, \"the ritual requires that she stand here, as she is now, for all seven days before she turns to stone as your Guardian. But should anyone attempt to do harm on you she'll break free to protect you and return to frozen stone again afterward.\" \"How...how long have I been...been...dead?\" \"Some people wake up instantly after death, some take weeks, months, others take years. You've been gone two years. She's been your Guardian for one.\" \"Why isn't her name on the stone too?\" \"She is neither dead nor alive. She just is. And she will be until her years on earth are up. When she would normally pass on had she not done this, she will meet you in the next world, no older than when she turned to stone. When she does, her name will be added beside yours.\" \"She did this for me?\" Jacob asked, still in shock. \"For me?\" \"She loved you very much.\" \"She never said anything,\" Jacob's voice was low as he turned back to Angela, resting a hand on hers. \"And neither did I.\" Upon closer look he saw wet tracks running down her face from her eyes. She was crying silent tears for him. \"Angel?\" Her hand felt soft, the way he remembered them when they were both still alive, though it still resembled the grey stone. With the sound of stone grating on stone her head came up and she looked him in the eyes with a blank stare that was somehow still her. She moved her other hand on top of his. \"Angel, I love you. I'm sorry I never told you before,\" Jacob whispered. I know, Jacob. I love you too and I'm sorry I never said anything either. Her lips never moved but he heard her beautiful voice talking to him all the same. \"I'll be waiting for you.\" I'll be there as soon as I can. Her hand lifted from his and came to rest against his face for a moment before falling back to its place on his tombstone. Her head bent again and he no longer felt the soft skin of her hands but the rough stone. Tears tracked his face where her hand had been. \"How long would she have lived?\" \"That, I cannot tell you, for even I do not know.\" There was a long pause as Jacob stared at Angela's stone form, hands resting on his tombstone, her head bent, tears dripping from her face to land with heavy splashes onto his stone. \"Do you have any more questions before I must go?\" Jacob thought for a moment and shook his head. \"Then I wish you the best.\" The Messenger's light went out but a new light brightened in front of Jacob. It came from Angela, about where her heart should have been, Jacob guessed, a feeling of wonder coming over him. \"She has found the light from within that I told her to look for after you'd woken from your long sleep,\" The Messenger's voice explained in the darkness behind Jacob. \"That light is for you. And only you will be able to see it once I'm gone.\" Jacob only nodded. After another long pause he felt a breath of hot wind and knew The Messenger was gone, finally leaving him alone with Angela's stone form. He placed a hand on each of hers, and, with tears coursing down his cheeks he looked up into her resolute face. Among the hardened will and eternal sadness he found another expression that hadn't been there before: eternal love. Feeling her warm light seeping into him through his hands, he smiled through his tears. \"Thank you, Angel. Thank you very much.\" The End A/N: Please do not forget to post a review. Thanks.

Thanks to the former for sharing, and to the latter for writing. Space Needle to Stratosphere Dinner was a sublime and magnificent affair. Angela was pleasantly surprised by what a fantastic cook Sean was. He diced, sautÃ©ed, baked, and garnished, working the kitchen in a manic frenzy, but somehow managing to steal kisses from her every fifteen minutes. It was not immediately obvious, but he maintained an organized efficiency amidst the apparent chaos and made the entire process look effortless. Angela found it immeasurably sexy and could not tear her eyes from his busy hands. How many times have we sat like this, just us two? \"No, really! There must be something I can do.\" She laughingly insisted for the fifth time, in between sips of an exquisite glass of wine he had poured for her. Her legs were crossed and dangling off of a high bar stool. She leaned across the kitchen island, on which her Sean was rapidly chopping up garlic, and whispered conspiratorially, \"Would you like some music? I could sing for youâ€¦\" He burst out laughing. \"I appreciate the thought, Darlingâ€¦\" Another kiss, chaste and sweet. \"â€¦ Alright, since you insist so hard on assisting me â€“ \" He made a great show of looking around the kitchen for some chore for her before turning back. \"Yes?\" Angela smiled sweetly at him. The wine was giving her a lovely buzz, and he looked damn good in his black button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. \"I could use some compliments. How about you tell me what a strong and handsome man I am, and how sexy everything I'm doing is? You know, sport commentary styleâ€¦\" \"Oh!\" She giggled and sat her glass down, beginning to recount everything he was doing with great flattering exaggeration. She stopped and stared when he opened the oven door and took out the glazed salmon, followed by scallops with honeyed walnuts, mushroom stuffed with buttered beef and onions, and generous sides of snow peas and potato au gratin. The presentation for every dish was flawless. \"Sean, this looksâ€¦ just amazing!\" She felt overwhelmed by the decadent feast spread before her eyes. Sean was looking immensely pleased with himself. \"Well, it's your first dinner at home sinceâ€¦ the incident. It's cause for celebration. For a while there, I thoughtâ€¦\" He sobered up for a few seconds, and then the smile reappeared. \"I'm the luckiest man alive, Love, to have you back by my side.\" His serious face grew blurry, and Angela hastily dabbed tears from her eyes. She leaned over and kissed him, her hand cradling his face. \"Thank you,\" she murmured. \"Mmmm.\" He looked into her eyes. Then he straightened up, poured himself a glass of wine, too, and raised it. \"Cheers to second chances.\" Angela grinned and clinked her glass against his. They began eating. Everything was delicious and seasoned to perfection. However, she was secretly disappointed that none of the food rang any bells in her mind. She had hoped that his cooking would somehow taste familiar. Give it a little more time. It's only been two days! \"So I was thinking we could use a little vacation. How do you feel about spending your sick leave in Vegas? It was one of our favorite vacation spots.\" There was a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \"I'd lose track of the time playing poker, and you went to so many shows, you should get paid writing for travel guides.\" \"Yeah?\" Angela thoughtfully chewed her scallop. The mini-explosions of flavors in her mouth were a little distracting. She swallowed, \"Sounds good to me. We do have those two weeks off, right?\" He nodded. Plans were made to leave for Sin City in two days. Full and still-buzzed from their mind-blowing dinner, Angela helped her husband clean up, insisting that since he had done all the cooking, chipping in for the aftermath was the least she could do. Her stern gaze made Sean relent and they chattered happily as the mess was quickly cleared away. There was an undercurrent of intimacy sharing the mundane tasks, and when Sean had put the last plate in the dishwasher and set it to run, she found herself staring into his eyes. The sudden silence felt charged, and she did not dare break the spell. He leaned in and captured her lips. Angela draped her arms around his shoulders and opened her mouth to him. When he groaned and picked her up, she straddled her legs around his waist and let him carry her up the stairs and into their bedroom. They fell heavily into the huge, luxurious bed with their limbs entwined. Sean's lips and hands were everywhere, roaming freely and inching her sundress up to reveal more skin. His stiffness pressed insistently against her thigh, and when he cupped a hand and gently squeezed her left breast, Angela moaned into his mouth. Encouraged, he yanked the dress over her head and it went sailing to the floor. He sat up and unbuttoned his shirt impatiently, while his eyes raked over her near-naked body with a hungry lust. Even though Angela was now only clad in her bra and underwear, she felt feverish in the heat of their contact. He kissed her deeply then trailed his lips down her jawline, to the crook of her neck, to the valley between her breasts. His voice was husky when he spoke, \"I'd be lying if I didn't admitâ€¦ I've been looking forward to this moment, you and me alone, since seeing you in the hospital.\" Angela felt her heart jump. In the blink of an eye, she had shoved him off and tore across the room, stopping at the doorway. Her face was deathly pale as she stared at her husband, half naked on the bed and gazing at her in shock. Her heart was racing and she felt goosebumps breaking out all over. \"Honey â€“ everything ok?\" Sean stammered weakly. Angela could not speak. She felt slightly insane, but in her mind, her Sean was looming over her, holding onto her tightly with a knife pressed against her throat. What was that all about? Where in the world did that image come from? \"Iâ€¦ I don't knowâ€¦\" It was the truth. A little voice in her mind was telling her to tread the water very carefully right now. \"Umâ€¦ I thoughtâ€¦ did youâ€¦\" Do NOT say the first thing that pops into your head. Count to three. Oneâ€¦ twoâ€¦ threeâ€¦ \"Sweetie?\" Sean had swung his legs over the bed and was walking rapidly to her. She stared at him, torn between the instinct to share the impossible image that came to her mind and her impulse to turn and flee. He put his arms around her and gently embraced her. \"I'm sorry, Angela. I keep forgetting not to rush you. Please forgive me.\" Her face pressed against his bare shoulders, Angela nodded. Once again, she felt safe in his arms. But she needed time â€“ alone time â€“ to process what had just happened. Her gut feeling was telling her to examine that bizarre moment in private. She looked up into his warm, worried eyes and forced a smile. \"It's ok. I think it's just been a long day. I'm more exhausted than I realize. I thinkâ€¦ I'll probably have a bath and turn in for the night.\" Disappointment fleeted across his face, but it was gone in the next moment and he nodded in understanding. \"Yes, of course, that sounds like a good idea. I didn't mean to push you. We will take as much time as you need.\" He paused for a moment. \"I love you, Angela.\" She gently extricated herself from his arms, grabbed a change of clothes, and walked as quickly as she can toward the bathroom without running. At the door, she paused and turned around. He was still standing in the same spot, watching her with an inscrutable expression on his face. As hard as she tried, Angela could not decipher what he was thinking. \"Thank you for dinner. It was lovely.\" She said in an attempt to smooth over the awkward moment. Something was very, very wrong, and the air itself seemed to hum with a sinister quality. He nodded, and she disappeared into the bathroom, shutting the door gently behind her.

Angela awakes in the afternoon, remembering her chat with Sorcerer earlier. She knew she needed to find some files on herself. The Praetorians must have saved files of her, and there must be some evidence she can unlock using her recently aquired knowledge of their methods of encryption. [Ohhh... That little nap felt good.] Angela mumbled to herself as she combed her hair back a little and sat down at the table in her livingroom. It wasn't actually *her* livingroom, it was a hotel room at a Ramada Inn. She stays at various hotels to keep herself safe from Trelawney's search for her. She will be moving out of her current hotel on Wednesday. Angela sat down on one of the soft seats at the livingroom table. In front of her was her taptop. She flicked it on, and the screen transmitted light to her face. It took her about a minute to connect to her ISP (Internet Service Provider) and when she did, she saw that she had an e-mail message. The message's origin was not shown. It had been sent by anonymous means. Once Angela opened it, she found that it was encoded. The encoding message used was simple ROT13. Angela clicked an onscreen button and the message was unencoded. The message read: Angela, You do not know who this is. I work under Trelawney's command at the Praetorian Guard. I have learned of your story, and I would like to help you. I have a disk with evidence that can clear your name. I know that there is no way for you to know whether I am who I say I am, or whether I am loyal to the Guard. I will leave the disk at the Snow CyberCafe. You know where it is located. Look in the disk drive of computer number 13 once inside. You will see that inside of the drive is a white disk. Take the disk out of the cafe, and decrypt it. The encryption method used can be broken by running a \"ripper\" over it. You will probably recognize the method of encryption anyways. Well, I wish you luck. [Wow,] Angela thought to herself after reading the message. [I wonder who would want to help me...] After thinking about it for a few minutes, she got up and walked out to her car. She was going to drive to the Snow CyberCafe, not too far from the hotel. She had written down the computer number, and she had saved the e-mail message on her computer so that she might be able to use it in the future for something. Inside the Snow CyberCafe... Angela walked into the lobby where all the computers were. Each computer had a small table of which the computer rested on. Also, every computer had a number above it. Angela looked around the personless lobby for computer number thirteen. After a few seconds, she found it and walked over to it. She looked at the computer. It was a recent addition to the cafe. She looked into its disk drive and found the white disk. Angela had her laptop in the car, so she walked out of the cafe with the disk and stuck the disk into her laptop. Contents... She opened the disk. A prompt came up that asked for a password. Angela ran a cracker on it, searching for the number/letter combination that would allow access. It took roughly ten minutes to find the password. Once she found it, she entered inside of the disk. She could see quite a few folders, and they all had her name on them. It was a relief that the folders were labeled with her REAL name, Angela Bennett. It was a name that she didn't get to hear too often. She looked into the folders. In one of the folders, she found her picture and saw her real name and a profile. Everything was correct. Also, there was a section explaining her identity theft. This disk would be the one to free her from the charge of murder. She would have to keep it safe, though, in order to claim her innocence... __To_Be_Continued__ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ In this little segment, Angela was told of a disk that could prove her innocence, and she will next have to try to keep the disk protected. In some of the upcoming stories, you will read of the battles she has to fight to protect the disk, and more than likely, you will see who the person was who gave her the disk.

This time she had some information to inform Sourcerer of so that he could make and analysis. The information was about Praetorian Guard information she had stolen with a computer. She had gathered info about finances, data security, and disposal of delicate information. The info she had stolen was on a disk that she downloaded it to from one of the Praetorian's main computers. The information was encrypted, but fortunately, the encryption method was old enough to be recognized by a recently aquired encryption scanner. Angela had run the scanner and found out that the encryption method wasn't all too complicated. Any programmer could have compiled the means. Once she figured out the method of encryption, she had run a \"ripper\" on the encryption program and stripped it down to bare coding. Then she had found the passwords written within the encoding. The passwords were on a \"rotary.\" They rotated, and every day the program required the user to know the newest password. Within a few minutes, Angela saw the familiar username \"Sourcerer\" on her screen. \"Hello, Angela.\" Sourcerer's voice came through the speakers of Angela's laptop. \"Good morning, Sourcerer. I trust you are doing well.\" \"You trust correctly. What is on your mind?\" \"I have stolen some information from one of the Praetorian Guard's main computers.

So, he just called her \"that brown haired woman\" until everyone knewnwho he was talking about even before he'd uttered a word. And soon, theynjust told him the news without him having to ask. The answer was alwaysn'no.' No, was good, and bad in this case. Good because that meant thatnthere was a chance that Sean or the cops could find her and that she wasnsafe from them. And it was bad, because this meant that Jacob didn't knownwhere she was. She could have been terribly wounded somewhere on her own,nor who knew what else. Jacob waited and worried about Angela for almost a whole year,nwondering what he should do, and if he should leave town and go search fornher on his own. Not like he'd have much luck finding her after all thisntime. She'd had lots of practice hiding from Sean, and the authorities. Shenwould be good at it now, too good even, for him to find her. Then one day Jacob was putting his gun away and talking to a fellownofficer about a recent case, when the officer suddenly burst out, \"Therenshe is! There's Lix Marx! Right here in your own house!\" he had alreadyngone for his radio as Jacob turned around. Angela was indeed standing there, but one look at Jacob in hisnuniform and she took off running with tears streaming down her face. \"Angel? Angel wait!\" Jacob quickly changed into a pair of old jeans, a t-shirt, andnsneakers so that he'd look more like his old self, they way she'd remembernhim, though without the bleach in his hair. He ran off after her. Up aheadnhe could still see her running. She didn't look very stable and he wonderednhow she kept going. She ran into a barn and Jacob followed her. He foundnher slumped down in a corner. She did not look good at all. Her clothesnwere tattered and torn all over, her face was pale, she was covered in cutsnand bruises , and she was very thin. \"Angel?\" Jacob walked over to her. \"Jacob? Is it really you?\" \"Yes, it's me.\" He sat down and pulled her into his lap. She threw her arms aroundnhim in a hug, thankful that she'd found him. \"Were you wearing a police uniform?\" she asked after letting him go. \"I was.\" Angela bolted upright and tried to get away but Jacob held her backnand brushed the tears from her face. \"Angel, listen to me. I thought that by becoming a cop I could helpnyou better. But then you disappeared and I never saw you or heard from younuntil now.\" She began to shake a little as if she was cold. Jacob grabbed annearby blanket, brushed off some hay and wrapped it around her. She didn'tnsay anything. \"Angel, what happened to you out there?\" Jacob held her close and she rested her head against his chest so shencould hear his heart beating. \"Lots of things happened to me. Mostly I ran. I had to run a lot, younknow, from Sean. He almost got me a few times, but I managed to get away. Inslept whenever and wherever I could, and ate when I could too. I tried tonsave my money so that it would last. I ran out the other day.\" \"It's OK, Angel, you're safe now. Just promise me you won't run awaynagain for so long without contacting me somehow. I was really worried aboutnyou.\" \"I promise.\" They were silent for a while.n\"When was the last time you slept?n\"That depends. Do you mean a really good nights sleep or the last time Ingot any sleep at all?\"n\"Both\"n\"Well, the last time I slept at all was probably four or five nights agonand the last time I slept really well, that was the last time I was on yourncouch.\"n\"When was the last time you ate?\" \"I don't know. The day before yesterday maybe.\" \"Oh God...We need to get you home, so you can rest and get some food.nEverything will be much better from now on, I promise.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You found her!\" several cops ran into the barn. \"Good job Officer Resh! You found Liz Marx. But might I ask what younare doing?\" \"Her name is not Liz Marx. It's Angela Bennett.\" \"Well, whatever, she's still under arrest.\" \"No she's not. She's innocent. She hasn't done anything, least of allnkill someone. And can't you tell she's not well? She's had a lot happen tonher in the past year.\" \"So? If she's sick we'll send her to a hospital before prison.\" \"She's not going to prison if I have anything to say about it.\" Jacobnstood up, still holding Angela tightly against him wrapped up in thenblanket. \"Jacob, I want to go home, take me home,\" Angela said quietly. \"We're going home now,\" Jacob said, carrying her past the othernofficers and out the door. \"As of today, right now, I quit. You'll have mynbadge and gun on your desk in the morning.\" \"No, Jacob, don't quit.\" \"If it means protecting you, I'll do anything.\" Jacob took her back to his house where he put her in his own bed, andnmade her some soup and some tea. But by the time the food was ready, Angelanwas sound asleep. He pulled up a chair and rested his chin in his rightnhand and gently brushed the hair off her forehead while he watched hernsleeping peacefully. He then began to talk quietly to her as she slept, \"I know it mightnbe awhile before you're back to your old self again, I know. But you'renback, where you belong, and I'm here now, to make sure nothing happens tonyou. I promise the cops will leave you alone. I'll make sure they don'tntake you away to prison. As for Sean? Well, he night be a bit harder tondeal with. But when you're stronger, well, then we can deal with himntogether. Some day, we will get rid of him, once and for all and then wencan lead a normal, peaceful life together. Oh, and Angel....I love you.\" ","Summary":" The Net: \"Take Me Home\" The policemen had finally cut Angela loose.

Mark is justnsome random guy I stuck in here, he's not anyone from the show or anything.nAs for the bar, well, I needed a place where they could meet, kinda likenCD's Bar And Grill on Walker, Texas Ranger. It's like a regular hang out,nthough here they're only there once. Also, the spaces between paragraphsnindicate POV change between Jacob and Angela. Hope you understood allnthat! Anyway, enjoy! The Net: \"Engagments\" Jacob left the jewelry shop the same time Mark walked in. They saidn'hi' and went on their separate ways. Jacob went back to his dorm roomnwhere he was in the middle of packing his stuff and thanking God thatncollege was now finally over. He took the little black box out of hisnpocket and opened it. Inside was a beautiful diamond ring, and tomorrownnight he was taking her out to dinner. That's when he planned to ask her.nThey were going to the best restaurant in town, The Victorian. He knewnshe'd say yes. She had to! He put the ring away and continued to pack. Angela was at the bar the next day where she met Jacob. \"So, Jacob, are you going to tell me why we're going to The Victorianntonight?\" she asked. \"Nope. It's a secret.\" Jacob smiled with a sparkle in his eyes. \"Hmmmm, you're gonna make me guess huh?\" \"Even if you guess right, I won't tell you one way or the other.\" Knowing that it would be something good, since it was coming fromnhim, she said with a smile on her face, \"Oh darn. I guess I'll just have tonwait then.\"n\"Don't worry Angel, it will be worth the wait.\" Jacob just loved talking to Angela. Just being with her, in the same room,nfilled his heart with a certain joy that he'd never known before. \"ANGEL! There you are! I've been looking all over for you!\" Mark camenover and pulled Angela to the center of the room. \"Everyone, may I havenyour attention please!\" Everyone in the room turned to face him. \"I have anproposal to make, to my special Angel here.\" Jacob cringed. Mark had stolennhis nick name for Angela. \"So, here goes, Angel, marry me?\" David pullednout a little black box that contained an engagement ring.nAngela's hands went to her mouth and Jacob's heart pounded. She gasped, andnsaid yes. The crowd cheered and Jacob's heart broke into a million littlenpieces. Quickly he turned and stumbled out of the room and into the brightnsunlight. Up until now, he'd had no reason to hate Mark. True, he knew Marknliked Angela, he just never thought it would go this far! Angela turned from the crowd around her to see Jacob leave. She wanted tongo to him but the crowd wouldn't let her. She turned back to Mark who wasnsmiling from ear to ear. She smiled too. If Jacob had been there he'dnnotice something was wrong. Her smile suddenly wasn't true. He'd know. Henwas her best friend. She wanted him to say this engagement was OK. If hensaid no she wouldn't go through with it. But he had left so abruptlynwithout even saying goodbye to her. Angela almost felt like crying when shenshould be happy. Why had he left? She wondered. Was there some important thing he hadnto do? Or was there something more? Jacob ran back to his dorm room and finally finished packing. He lugged hisnbags and boxes out to his car. When he was done he went back to the roomnfor anything he had left behind. He saw a small black box with somethingnglittering in it on the floor. He slowly picked it up to see what it was.nIt was the engagement ring he had bought the day before. It seemed tonscream a happiness he would never know. Today, he would find a new home fornthe ring. Now, never hoping to return to where she lived, he left his dorm.nHe loved her too much to stay. Mark had already left the bar a half hour ago, leaving Angela sitting there, not knowing what to do, and still wondering why Jacob had left all of a sudden. Her thoughts fell on comparing Mark and Jacob. Mark liked to be the highlight of everything. He also had tons ofnmoney from his father and he could be very snobby at times. She knew henwanted her as a girlfriend, well fiancÃ© now, soon to be wife. He'd shown itnalmost right from the very moment when they'd first met. He was alwaysncomplimenting her, and wanting to buy her things. Sometimes she felt he wasngoing a little overboard, but he liked being that way and there seemed tonbe no way of stopping him. He also therefore liked taking her out to dinnernat the most expensive restaurants around. And though she did enjoy them onnoccasion, he never liked anything else.nJacob, on the other hand, didn't want to be the highlight of everything,nthough if someone else put him there, and it didn't last long then it wasnOK. He was also nice to just about everyone he met. She didn't know what henthought of her, besides as a very good friend. Though Jacob always had thisnquiet way of admiring her, he hardly ever said anything directly to her outnloud nor did he buy her tons of unnecessary things, but she could read itnin his eyes; Deep blue pools of eyes she felt like she could stare intonforever, given the chance. They'd hung out together almost everyday, andnhad gone out to dinner or lunch on a number of occasions, though nevernanything as upscale as The Victorian. He had almost no money to his namenwhatsoever. So from this she knew, whatever he had hidden up his sleevenfor tonight must be something special.nThey were both so different, so much opposites. After debating the issue,nshe knew what must be done. She had to go see her best friend. She went tonJacob's dorm room, hoping to find him there, still packing. The place wasnempty except for a small black velvet box. She picked it up and stared atnit. It was as empty as the room. Taking it with her, she left. Her heart ached to see him already. And then, there he was standing anfew feet away from her. He was talking to someone. She couldn't tell whonbecause of a huge bush that was in the way. \"Look, I'm not asking much. Just promise me you'll take real goodncare of her,\" Jacob was saying. \"Sure I will,\" Mark answered. Jacob turned and walked away as the skies suddenly opened up and rainnbegan to pour down on them, in a million tiny droplets. Angela moved sonthat she could see Mark. She watched him smile to himself as she got soakednby the rain. She didn't care about getting wet. Jacob was leaving! Hendidn't even need to say it. She just knew. The way he had asked Mark tontake care of her, the way he had slowly turned around and slowly walkednaway, they had said more to her than anything in the world. He didn't wantnto go. She didn't want him to leave either. He was her best friend, or wasnhe more than that? The thought came up so quickly. Maybe she really didncare more about him than she had thought. But she couldn't think about thatnnow. She was engaged to someone else. She had to remember that. There wasnno choosing between them. Mark had already asked, and she'd said yes. Evennso, she still wanted to see Jacob. She wanted to hear him say he was OKnwith her marrying Mark because maybe his leaving the bar so fast meant thatnhe wasn't OK with it. \"Angel, what are you doing here? You're getting soaked!\" Mark said,nupon finding her out in the rain. She looked up at him. \"Mark, was that Jacob?\" \"Oh yeah! He just left. Said he had one more stop to make before he'snoutta this place for good.\" \"Did he say where he's going?\" \"Don't worry, he's not going to see you!\" His quick, sharp wordsnstung her heart a bit, and her eyes sprang full of salty water, thoughnthrough the rain he couldn't tell. \"Now, I was thinking we could donsomething tonight, you know, to celebrate.\" He took her hand and lookedndown at her ring, praising himself for buying such an expensive ring. \"No. Jacob and I had a date tonight at The Victorian and I don'tnintend on breaking it.\" \"Jacob? But you're engaged to me now, not him. Besides, he's leaving.nSo, where shall we go? I'll take you to The Victorian.\" \"NO! Look, I'll see you later. I've got to find Jacob!\" Angela rannoff. Jacob stood on the bridge overlooking the small river. In his hand was thenring. All he wanted to do was throw it in the water and get away from thisnplace. He'd probably get into an accident somewhere out on the road, but hendidn't care. There was no use in caring anymore. He pulled his arm back tonthrow the ring when he felt someone grab his hand. \"Jacob don't...\" No! his mind screamed. He hadn't wanted to see her again for fear hisnheart would break all over again. \"No,\" he said out loud. He couldn't bear to look at her as the rainncontinued to come down in sheets. He knew full well that it was Angela, hisnAngel no longer. \"Angel, I mean Angela, please, just go away and leave menalone.\" \"It's OK, Jacob, I'll always be YOUR Angel. I mean it Jacob. I lovenyou.\" He turned around and his eyes met hers. \"Angel,\" he whispered. Henfound himself wrapping his arms around her, giving her a warm hug. \"I lovenyou too.\" Angela only held onto him tighter. \"But, can I ask younsomething?\" \"What?\" She asked, letting go of him. \"What about Mark? And how did you find me here?\" Angela thought about it for a few minutes. \"Anytime something's wrongnJacob, you come here. I knew something was wrong the way I've seen younacting today ever since he proposed. \"Oh. But, when did you see me?\"n\"When you left the bar, and then again not that long ago, talking to Mark\" \"Wait, you saw that?\" \"Yeah, I didn't hear everything you said though.\" \"Oh. So what about Mark then?\" \"Well, I knew something was wrong and that you were going to leave me. And I didn't want that. Mark wanted to take me out to dinner tonight to celebrate our engagement, but I said no cause you and I had a date. Well, he got kinda mad at me, and basically said you didn't matter anymore cause I was engaged to him and not you. But see, you do matter, and if he wasn't going to accept you being in my life too, well, then he could just say goodbye to the both of us then.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry Angel, for wanting to leave and all, I just...\" \"No, look, if I'd had a clear head about me when he asked, thisnwouldn't have happened. I mean, I was just so surprised, I didn't know whatnto say or anything.\" \"It's OK, the whole thing is over now, we can just forget it evernhappened.\" This time it was Angela who hugged him. And they didn't part untilnMark's voice could be heard through the thick rain. \"Get away from mynfiance! If you want me to take care of her! Angel, come over here, you'llnbe safer with me.\" \"That's 'Angela' to you!\" she shouted to him. She took off the ringnMark had given her and handed it to Jacob. \"I believe you were going tonthrow something earlier? How about this?\" He took it from her and threw it with all of his might into thenraging river below. Ignoring Mark's ranting and raving, Jacob turned backnto her. He still held his own ring in his tightly clenched fist. \"Angel,nthere's something I have to tell you..I..yesterday..well, I got younsomething...I was going to give it to you tonight..at dinner.but.well, Inmight as well ask you now..I don't think I could wait..after all that'snhappened..\" \"Go ahead..\" \"Angel, will you marry me?\" He opened his hand to reveal the ring innhis palm. The most beautiful ring she'd ever seen. On a golden band therenwas a diamond with a smaller fire blue spinal stone on one side and a topaznon the other, one signifying his birth month, and the other the month shenwas born in. Once again, for the second time that day, her hands went to her mouthnin surprise. She gasped. \"Jacob, it's beautiful! I love it! Of course younknow I'll say yes! And this time I know what I'm doing!\" Jacob slipped the ring on her finger. \"Oh my God, you know I never even suspected..This is.this is.wow! Indon't know what to say!\"nShe looked up at him, into his deep blue eyes and before she knew what wasnhappening, their lips met in a slow soft kiss. When they pulled apart,nJacob just held her there in his arms, thankful that he hadn't left afternall.n\"Angel, I think we're going to have to skip The Victorian tonight. Ournreservations were for half an hour ago. They've probably already been givennaway to someone else. I'm sorry.\" he whispered in her ear.n\"That's OK. I don't mind. We're both totally soaked, and right now I justnwant to go home with you,\" she whispered back. ","Summary":" Note: This is after the Praetorians have been gotten rid of.

The events andnincidents occurring in this piece are fictional. If these events occurred,nit is pure coincidence. This piece is not meant to slander actual names ofncelebrities, directors, or motion picture studios. It was created fornpersonal enjoyment and for the insanity of entertainment business. I am anfan of the Columbia Pictures film The Net and hope those who read, enjoy.nThank you. * THE NET: THE LOST SCRIPT (THE SETTING) PRE-PRODUCTION:nTHE SCRIPT IS SOMEWHERE, BUT WHERE? Columbia Pictures held their final meeting in the boardroom to executenproduction for their latest film \"The Net.\" Irwin Winkler and hisnproduction entourage gathered around the waiting room in a football huddlenpulling hair, spilling coffee, and filling the room with cigarette smoke.nThere is a lot of \"hot air\" in the motion picture business before the filmnis actually put into motion, and included in today's events was a nurse onncall to insure Columbia to measure blood pressure and an Intern who wasndesigned to specifically take food orders from the big shots in thenboardroom. Scattered around the waiting room area were a couple ofnentertainment magazines, coffee cups, and ash trays. Irwin Winkler, thendirector of The Net, finally decided to sit down on the grey colored lovenseat to relax and gather his thoughts. He began massaging his temples. Henwas more concerned whether Sandra Bullock and Jeremy Northam would sign tonthe lead roles of Angela Bennett and Jack Devlin. The studio feared thatnThe Net would turn into another \"SPEED\" by signing Bullock. There weren'tnany buses, heavy explosives, and there wasn't Keanu Reeves in this budget. A majority of the employees at the studio acted as if they were on SPEED,nignoring the reference to the blockbuster film, but the illegal drugs whichncould easily be bought outside the studio. Northam on the other hand, anCambridge Englishman and sophisticated actor of particular parts was also anconcern for the studio. Expensive merchandise are trained actors withnextensive expertise in playing the roles of seductive and powerful leadingnmen. The character of Jack Devlin was seductive, charming, and anninsensitive bitter bastard. They needed to see force and dedication innseeking a diskette from Bullock's character. This included a stipulation innthe contract that Northam needed to know how to drive a boat whilenintoxicated after a few Mexican drinks. He needed to learn how to use ansilencer on Bullock's character inside the confines of a comfortable boat.nNortham also needed to desire Bullock's character sexually which wasn'tnvery hard with actresses before since most of them desired him personally. Many thoughts were surging through Winkler's mind while staring at thendoors of the executive boardroom . \"Why wasn't I invited?\" Winkler thoughtnto himself. Perhaps Hugh Hefner was in the boardroom showing off Playboynbunnies to the black tie executives. Cocktail wieners, margaritas, andnfresh marijuana could also contribute to this closed door meeting. Another issue of concern. What Internet interface was Bullock's characterngoing to use in her role? The entourage called AOL America Online, but CEOnSteve Case wasn't available and had already booked a deal for a film calledn\"You've Got Mail,\" the catchy AOL phrase now a major motion picturenproject. Winkler decided that the Internet program Angela Bennett would usenwould be a basic net service not available to those who see the film. ThennWinkler shrugged. The marketing behind this film is hideous. There arenmillions of Internet users and if the studio had a deal with an actual netnprovider, the studio may have profited more cash and gained further fanninterest. Delusional fifteen year olds may have wanted to know what it wasnlike to be Angela Bennett and what it would be like to explore Mexico withnJack Devlin. Since no one thought on the level of net merchandising, thenfake net provider for the film would include a website callednPIZZA.NET.COM, where Angela could order pizza from her computer and chargenthe small fee of $14.00 dollars to her VISA or MASTERCARD. (We do not seenher VISA or MASTERCARD in the film, but we assume she has one) What idiotncharges $14.00 to their VISA or MASTERCARD? Being that Winkler was annAmerican Express card holder, he began to transform his mind in the waitingnroom of the executive offices. Ignore audience reaction and hire DennisnMiller as a psychiatrist. The doors of the boardroom opened like heaven's gates opening to the dead.nLight shed on Winkler's entourage and his own face. Finally, relief. Henfelt like he had become a slave imprisoned at Columbia Pictures. The blackntie executive group walked towards the entourage staring at them like mice.nWinkler's group felt a sigh of relief yet didn't stare directly at theirneyes. Was their radon spreading in the room? Their eyes seemed to glow red,ndirectly from hell. A larger, heavy set man smoking on a cigar approachednWinkler and his entourage. \"Well it looks like you have yourself a done deal Winkler. We are grantingnyou your budget.\" He patted Winkler on his back and blew some cigar smokenin his face. A pale faced Winkler suddenly turned to a rosy red SantanClaus. God had answered his prayers and the film was a done deal. Now,nthere was so much to do and so little time. To be continued.. ","Summary":" *The story created here on FANFICTION.NET is fictional.

Things are not the same as they are on the show, but I do put some explanation in so that you understand why things are the way they are, though it might be a bit long. Well, anyway, read, enjoy, and post a comment to tell me what you think! Thanks! The old cement building was hardly usable anymore with no glass where the windows should be and no electricity. The yellow paint was chipped and peeling, revealing the cold hard cement and the only running water went to a large fountain on the first floor. The fountain was a wide circular bath three feet deep and made with an array of colorful tiles still intact from the building's days of glory. In the center stood an angel, her wings outspread, and the vase she held running over with water into the pool below. On the second floor of the old building a few families who could hardly afford bread for the day had chosen rooms and moved in. Bare mattresses lined the floors, a few crates here and there filled with personal possessions could be found, or a box of old clothes. Nothing more. Wanted for cyber crimes she didn't commit under a name that wasn't hers, Angela Bennett lay on the narrow twin-sized mattress letting her mind wander at will. She wanted to get up and start rummaging for food, find an outlet of electricity and an internet connection to see what Sean Trelawney and his goons were up to. But she wasn't alone on the thin mattress. While she lay on her side, Jacob was right behind her, sleeping soundly with his arm draped over her. To disturb him would be wrong. He'd been up late the night before playing with the children in the building and when they refused to go to sleep without a bedtime story from him their parents had let him fulfill their wishes. In consequence, he'd gone to bed exhausted but happy. Angela thought of the events that had led them to the abandoned building in the middle of a forest clearing nowhere near civilization with it's inhabitants invisible to the outside world. Images of Jacob's grandmother falling to the ground with a bullet lodged in her forehead filled her mind. Sean was laughing with glee, the gun still in his hand as Angela watched from behind a bush, unable to save Nana before getting away. He didn't know who he'd killed and he really didn't care. He had the house burned then, Greg pouring gas throughout each room and Kelly lighting the match. The only two home at the time of their invasion had been Nana and Angela herself. Had he known he was taking Sorcerer's home away, Sean would have been even happier. As it was Sean only knew Angela was staying in the house, not who she was staying with. An added helper was that Jacob was at school. Angela thanked God everyday that Jacob was still alive and that Sean didn't know who he was. After that day, she and Jacob had made a pact to stay together for as long as they could, viewing that they only had each other now. After several months of wandering and evading the Praetorians, they'd stumbled upon the lonely building and decided to camp out there for a few days. Everything was quiet for the first few hours until an older woman appeared in front of them, startling Jacob who jumped to his feet intent on defending himself and Angela before he realized she meant them no harm. A trickle of people filed into the room as they began to understand that Jacob and Angela weren't there to report them but were also homeless. They were nice people, down on their luck, broke, squatters with nothing to lose but this last roof over their heads. They quickly became the family that both Angela and Jacob had lost and they'd decided to stay. It was out of the way, no one would find them there. One of the families gave them a twin mattress and they chose a room and moved in like everyone else. The feeling was almost overpowering. A bond had formed between all of them. They were one giant family coping with life together. Sharing a twin mattress with him wasn't as bad as she thought. Now she enjoyed the feeling of his arm around her and his body pressed up against hers, helping to keep her warm on cold nights. She remembered the first time he'd told her he loved her. She'd been afraid because she'd missed her period for two months straight. When she finally screwed up the nerve to tell him he said he'd scrounge up enough change to go into town and get a home pregnancy test for her. The morning he left he turned to her and looked her deep in the eyes and said: \"Angel, I love you. And whether you are pregnant or you're not, I will always love you. If you are, I will support you all the way. I will always be here for you either way. OK?\" She nodded dumbly as tears began to slip down her face. He wiped them away with his fingers before leaving a tender kiss on her lips. \"I love you,\" he said again. She pulled him into a long hug. \"I love you too,\" she whispered. \"Please, just come back, OK? I don't care if you can't get it, just come back.\" Now, one month later, without disturbing him, she rested her hand on her stomach, still surprised to know that she was three months pregnant with their baby. The thought still scared her, after all, she was a fugitive running away from the law because they thought she was someone else and from Trelawney who wanted God only knew what from her. How was she going to have a child in the middle of all that? Jacob was wonderful, despite everything. He wanted to be there for her. He wanted to have this family, no matter what they were running from. And she could tell, by the look in his eyes, he wasn't just saying it to make her feel better. Every night it seemed she told him she wasn't sure she could do this and every night he'd calm her fears and tell her she could do anything. She'd survived the Praetorians this far, one more hurdle would be a piece of cake. But she still wasn't sure. \"They come! They come!\" an urgent woman's voice came from the doorway, breaking into Angela's thoughts. She looked up into the frightened face of Maria who kept ringing her hands together. \"Who's here? What do you mean?\" Angela whispered, still not wanting to wake Jacob. \"The men you tell about! In big cars! They come! I see! I see them!\" A flashback to several weeks ago reminded Angela of the night she and Jacob had finally told the members of their adopted family a little about the Praetorians. Angela gently moved Jacob's arm and bolted to her feet, leaving him to sleep alone. Running to an empty window she saw three hummers bearing down the old dirt road and her heart beat faster and faster. \"I not know you!\" the woman said, backing away. \"I not know you! I tell them that!\" \"Thank you,\" Angela said before dashing towards the angel on the first floor. Around the edge of the room were small storage cupboards. She would crawl into one of those to hide. There was no evidence that she lived here and they didn't know Jacob. She prayed they wouldn't hurt anyone as she curled up inside the cupboard, her knees to her forehead, and closed the door. Silent tears ran down her face at the thought of what she'd just done to Jacob. He had no warning Sean was coming. Just a rude awakening by a steel toed boot perhaps and when he awoke, she'd be gone. She didn't want to scare him, but it was too late now. She heard the hummer engines stop right outside the front door. Heavy boots thundered into the building. \"Nice fountain,\" she heard Sean's voice say, just outside her cupboard. \"Find me Angela Bennett! I want no stone unturned!\" Heavy boots marched away, separated. Some went upstairs, others checked the rest of the first floor. When the heavy boots came back more shoes shuffled along and she knew they'd taken her new family, brought them down to see Trelawney. \"Ah, squatters, I see,\" Sean said to himself. \"Do you know this woman?\" \"No, I not know her!\" Marie said. Others chimed in with similar answers, but she didn't hear Jacob's voice. \"You there! Boy! Have you seen her?\" \"N...no. No, I haven't seen her,\" came Jacob's terrified voice, no doubt worried more about her than scared from Sean. \"No? No, are you sure?\" A blade. That was the sound of a blade being drawn! \"Because if you don't tell me where she is now, I'll just have to slit your throat and then where would we be, eh?\" \"She...she left...yesterday...didn't say where she was going!\" Jacob sputtered. \"And what if I don't believe you? Do you still want me to slit your throat?\" A small cry escaped Angela's lips at the thought of Jacob dead. Her cupboard door swung open with the help of one of Trelawney's goons to reveal the scene before her. Sean did have a long knife at Jacob's throat, only now, everyone had taken their eyes off him and were looking at her in surprise. \"Ah, Angela, so good of you to join us! I thought you'd be here soon,\" Sean said. Angela looked beyond them to the angel and knew what she had to do to protect Jacob and their baby. Crawling out she made a dash for the water.[Chapter 2] ThenNet: \"The Dying Pool\": Chapter 2 \"Stopnher!\" Sean yelled at his goons. Severalnmen in heavy armor tried to stop her but she squeezed through andndived into the pool towards the center. Under water now, she let allnof the air inside her escape in large bubbles. Her body rose to floatnon the water, head, arms, and legs hanging down. Running out of airnand trying not to breath Angela unconsciously opened her mouth tonsuck in large lungfulls of air, and got water instead. She gulped fornmore air, needing that precious air to keep her alive, yet refusingnto pull her head above water. Sean was up there, and if he found outnabout the child, he'd have a field day. This would save them all.nJacob could stay with their new family. Sean didn't know who henwas. He would leave the rest of them alone, she hoped. Blacknessnencroached on her vision, little by little. Acceptance of her fatenwas the only thing keeping her under the water, that and thenknowledge that Jacob would be safe. Barely she heard someone shout tonget her out. Trelawney maybe? There was a huge splash beside her, shenfelt the waves rocking her and strong familiar arms taking hold ofnher body before everything went black. Thennext thing she felt was water coming up out of her lungs, back up hernthroat, and out her mouth. Hands were pumping her chest as fast asnthey could. A voice. Familiar. \"PleasenAngel, please don't do this to me! I love you! I need you!\" Openingnher eyes she saw Jacob leaning over her, his hands on her chest and anfacial expression that said he'd been shaken to the core of hisnsoul. When he saw her eyes open he grabbed her into a hug and refusednto let go. She looked over at the pool, her grave no more and thoughtnof Sean knowing about the baby. She struggled out of Jacob's gripnand ran for the pool and the sanctity of the angel presiding over it.nClimbing over the edge she fell into the water, letting all her airnescape once again. Another splash, this time sooner than the last,nand those strong familiar arms pulling her up before she lostnconsciousness. Still in the water Jacob held her arms by her sides,nforcing her to look at him. \"Talknto me, Angel. What's wrong? What's going on? What did he do tonyou?\" he asked, a tone of urgency to his voice. \"No!nLet me go!\" Angela struggled to get free. Shenwas strong, but Jacob managed to hold his grip on her. \"Whynare you doing this?\" he asked. Throughnthe water dripping down his face she could see the fresh tearsnfalling from his eyes. She collapsed into his arms, letting him holdnher for a few minutes before helping her to the edge of the poolnwhere they sat down together. \"Why?\"nhe asked again, this time in a more gentle voice. Shenturned away, staring at the water. \"I know what Sean would do if henfound out...about...you know...\" she stumbled over her words,nresting her hand on her stomach. \"I thought maybe, I'd save younand the baby. I can't be a mother now. I've got to get this babynout!\" \"There'snno way. You know we can't afford that and...\" \"Therenare other ways. We can do it.\" \"No.nI don't want to risk your life for anything. I need you, Angel.nYou've given me a purpose in life. If you leave me, I have nothing.nI can't bear to lose you. I love you, Angel. And trust me when Insay we'll work through this together. OK? I know we can do it.nTogether we will be a family and beat Sean Trelawney.\" \"Thennpromise me this...\" she began, turning back towards him. \"Inwill promise you anything in the world.\" Shensmiled a faint smile before continuing, \"when this is over andnwe're not being chased anymore...promise me,\" she looked down atnhis soaked jeans. \"Promise me you'll marry me,\" she finished inna rush. Angelanlooked to either side at the water and the dry floor, and then at hernhands as she felt Jacob take her left hand in his. He had alreadyntaken off his class ring and was now slipping it onto her finger. Hentook her chin in his now ringless hand and lifted her head so thatnher eyes met his. \"Doesnthat answer your question?\" Shencould only nod, choked up with emotion as she was. Jacob leaned innand kissed her tenderly on the lips. \"Oh!nCongratulations!\" Maria exclaimed, coming out from another room. Itnwas then that Angela realized Sean and his goons were gone. \"Where...wherendid...?\" \"Oh,nMr. Hung got him alright!\" she said, motioning them to follow her. Innthe other room they found their family standing around a man tied upnon the floor. Sean Trelawney. \"Wherenare his people?\" Angela asked. \"Oh,nwhen they see what I do to him, they run away like sissies!\" ansmall Asian man said, nodding towards Jacob and Angela in a gesturenof welcome. Henproceeded to leap into the air and perform a perfect kick beforenlanding. He smiled as a moan escaped from Sean's mouth. He began tonwake up, trying to clear his head. \"Whatnuse do we have of him?\" Angela asked Jacob. \"Well,nif we keep him here he can't chase us anymore.\" \"Goodnpoint. I like it.\" Angelanstepped forward to stand in front of Sean and before anyone couldnobject she'd given him a front kick to the throat, killing himninstantly. \"Thanknyou Sean Trelawney. If it weren't for you, I never would have metnJacob. And thank you, Mr. Hung, for teaching me that move.\" Angelanbowed towards Mr. Hung and he nodded. Shenthen stepped back to stand beside Jacob, putting an arm around him asnhe put one around her and resting her head against his shoulder. Shenwas glad to have Sean out of the way, to have this family, and evennhappier to have Jacob by her side. If anyone had told her when they'dnfirst met that he'd end up as her lover, fiancee, and eventualnhusband, she would have laughed in their face. Back then he was justna skater boy with beached hair but he'd grown and changed sincenthen and he cared more about her than any other man she'd ever met. Itnwas a match made in heaven as one of their new family membersnadmitted he was an ex-priest and in front of the angel in thenfountain he married them one beautiful June morning just the daynbefore Ayanna Maria Resh was born.

It had been ten long years. And now just when he thought she could help it all came crashing down around him. Walking into the room and sitting himself down in front of the screen he found himself unable to think, unable to figure out why, why now? Why when he needed her again, needed her the most did it have to end up this way? After years of work, years of protecting others he found himself stumbling across an old friend. One that he had many encounters with years before when she was on the run trying to protect herself. It was his fault it had happened, and she reminded him constantly after they had first met face to face. Before then he had hidden himself, only watching, directing her to the next place, sending her to help others that were in danger. It was his fault she had to run, his fault they had caught her, his fault when she was hurt, but every time he would help her, every time he would arrange for someone to be there to help her. When she was in danger it was then that he had revealed his identity. It had taken a lot for him to do that, a lot for him to present himself in person knowing that she wouldn't believe it was him, knowing that she wouldn't believe a kid. But she did and they became close, working together to stop disasters, working together to protect the country. Sometimes they couldn't help, sometimes they were too late and good people, and people who they knew were killed because of what they knew, because of who they knew. Once they had brought the organisation down they knew it was time to move on, she had been offered a position within a government security agency whilst he decided to remain anonymous and continue with his life that he had. \" We'll keep in touch\" she had said as she was leaving \" No doubt\" he replied \" I'll see you around\" \" That you shall\" he paused as she climbed into her car \"I'll be following your footprints\" he yelled as she drove away And now she was gone, they had finally succeeded in what they always aimed for.

The day had been uneventful, which was a welcome relief from her usual days of being on the run. She was glad to be away from the city, even though she had spent most of her life growing up in the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle. She had finally settled into a small town just outside of Chicago, it was quaint and felt like it had been left behind in the Victorian era. The people were very friendly and and the community was small and private enough that she could blend in without worrying about the praetorians finding her. She knew it would take her a while to be able to let down her guard, to actually relax for once, but she hoped it might become normal for her once again. There was always a struggle within her, one side that wanted peace in this lifetime and another that could not rest after all she knew about the praetorians and their control over what seemed like the entire world. She decided she wanted a rest. She could pick up the fight again, but for now she needed respite, some time to gather herself. Sorcerer had agreed to cut off communication with her as a precaution. She knew he never intended to put her in harms way but it was a lot to ask of her to always be the one to face the praetorians with him being safely hidden behind the scenes. It had taken it's toll on her physically and emotionally. She wondered if Trelawney would ever stop hunting her, and if he'd be able to find her even here in this remote little town. Angela didn't want to think about it. She finished the last sip of her tea and settled into bed. It felt nice to be in an actual bed; not a couch, a cot in a shelter or even the horrible beds in the cheap motels she would occasionally have to hide out in. A real bed, and it was HER bed inside HER apartment. Angela pondered all the things she had taken for granted before, simple things like this. The night had an eerie ambiance ripe for visions and nightmares. She could hear the autumn wind howling outside her window and the newly fallen leaves dancing upon the cobblestone. The street lamps cast long shadows across Angela's window, more than once she imagined she seen something more there than trees. She knew it was her anxiety causing her to see things that weren't real and she was so exhausted it wasn't long before she drifted off to sleep, the deepest sleep she had had in a long time. ...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~...~ Angela awoken suddenly, she felt as if something had startled her awake but she could not remember if it was something in her dream or something real. She looked around in the darkness and did not see anything amiss in her room. She got up and went to the window, peering out to the street below. It was quiet and still. She guessed it must have been a nightmare which woke her, It certainly wasn't an unusual occurrence these days. She closed the blinds and turned to go back to sleep. When Angela turned she was suddenly filled with terror at the sight of a shadowy male figure between her and the bed. Angela went to let out a scream, but the figure rushed her and had her mouth muffled before she even had a chance to make a sound. She struggled to break free from the intruder but he had a firm grip on her. Angela threw wild punches and kicks and was finally successful in landing a swift kick to his shin, disabling him long enough for her to run. She darted towards the door but before she could make it the man had already seized her once again and she landed hard on the floor. Before she could even turn to fight him, he had a rag pressed tightly over her mouth, one she quickly realized was soaked in chloroform. Angela let out a muffled cry as she felt her consciousness drift away.[Chapter 2] Angela awakened in a dark basement. Her eyes darted around for any sign of her attacker, but there was only cold darkness and the occasional sound of water dripping from the old overhead pipes. She found herself on a small dank bed that looked like it was from an old asylum. Angela tried to move but realized her hands were secured to the posts of the headboard. She struggled to free her wrists from the restraints but is startled by a buzz emanating from the upper corner of the room. She hadn't noticed the camera mounted on the ceiling in the dim lighting. Who was watching her? and how long had she been there? Angela's fear started to turn to anger. She wanted answers. She began shouting to the camera, not sure if anyone was on the other side to hear her. The only reaction she got was a rhythmic electronic blinking light and silence. After a few minutes she gave up and slumped back against the iron headboard, the cold bars pressing uncomfortably into her back. She hoped this entire night was a dream, maybe it was another one of her nightmares. Just then Angela heard a distant metal door open with a creaky groan followed by footsteps. A well dressed man entered from the dark corridor. \"Well, look who's awake...\" the mysterious man said as he smoothed his overcoat, stopping at the foot of Angela's bed. \"Who are you...?\" Angela observed the man standing before her, wondering if he was another praetorian. He certainly looked the part. \"Who I am is not important Angela. You see, all you need to know is I am a business man. A business man rather gifted at certain tactics. How should I put it?...\" The man stroked his chin and smiled. I offer... \"resource gathering solutions.\" \"What the hell are you talking about!?\" Angela questioned with a tone of anger and frustration in her voice. \"Well it's really rather simple my dear. It's opportunistic headhunting. See, I've been tracking you for some time now, ever since I caught wind the praetorians had you at the top of their wish list...I'm willing to guess they'll pay handsomely to have you delivered to them.\" The man's smile now spread from ear to ear, no doubt with his imagining of the riches he would soon be enjoying. \"You are insane! You captured me to sell me to the praetorians? Do you really think they are going to give you a penny? They are ruthless and will simply kill us both after they get the information they need.\" \"True, but there is one praetorian whom you mean more to... I'm willing to bet he would accept my terms to have you in his personal possession...\" \"Trelawney...\" Angela murmured under her breath. \"Yes...He is rather fond of you. Perhaps too much for his own good.\" The man turned and started to pace around Angela's bed. \"Trelawney is dangerous and you are going to get yourself killed!\" Angela yelled, but received no reaction from the man. \"Please let me go...Angela pleaded. He's not going to give you what you want, you have to believe me. He's going to kill you. They are dangerous people, you have no idea what you've brought upon yourself.\" \"Silence!\" The man yelled as he lunged at Angela grabbing her by the hair and pulling her head back. Angela panicked as the man reached into his coat, pulling out a knife. \"I wonder if you'd be worth the same amount to him dead? Maybe I should send him a memento so he takes me seriously...\"Angela screamed as he cut a piece of her hair off. The man let out a wicked laugh. \"Do you really think you will get away with this?\" Angela sobbed, horrified by the man's actions. \"If you think for one second...\" \"Enough!\"...\"Playtime is over darling, I have work to do.\" The man walked over to a table and picked up a large roll of duct tape. He tore off a large piece and placed it firmly over Angela's mouth. \"You be a good girl or else I'll be sending you to Trelawney in pieces...\" The man exited the room, locking the large metal door behind him.[Chapter 3] Sean Trelawney was sitting at his desk, surveying files related to a covert military operation he was currently leading up. \"There can be no mistakes this time...\" he said to himself. Completely absorbed in his work, he failed to notice Mr. Olivier enter the room. \"Trelawney\" Somewhat startled, he turned to face the chairman who had an expression of grimace mixed with concern. \"Yes, Mr. Chairman?\" \"We just received a rather troubling message... it seems an extortionist has somehow \"acquired\" our Ms. Bennett.\" the chairman raised an eyebrow and adjusted his grip on his walking cane. Trelawney's eyes grow wide. \"Acquired?\"... \"Where is she being held?\" \"If we knew that we'd have her already Trelawney\" the Chairman remarked, turning to look out Trelawney's office window onto the main floor of the praetorian headquarters. Trelawney glanced down at his desk, his eyes shifting back and forth in deep thought. \"We are holding a video conference meeting with this man in an hour, we need to formulate a plan on how to deal with him. He has a valuable asset, but he thinks he's holding all the cards. We must take control of the situation...\" The chairman turns back to Trelawney; whom is still in contemplation. Trelawney suddenly glances up to face the chairman, as if awakened from a spell. \"Rest assured Mr. Olivier, I will rectify this situation...\" A dark and bitter grin forms across his face. Trelawney was slowly pacing back and forth in his office when a voice came over his intercom summoning him to the conference hall. Trelawney entered cautiously, taking his place at the table alongside the other leaders of the praetorians. He addressed them in his usual cool demeanor, attempting to mask his feelings of concern with stoic indifference, something he'd gotten very good at over the years. He couldn't remember the last time he let any tender feeling slip through and make him appear weak. That was how he got where he was, by being cool and calculated. There was no place in his world for feelings, at least that was what he used to think until he met her. She had compromised everything, making him feel things he didn't want to. At first it was just a physical attraction to her, something simple he could just call \"lust\". But after a while he started to feel things beyond that like affection, tenderness, longing...She would haunt him day and night, he could not stop thinking about her. Pursuing her became an obsession he cleverly disguised as unwavering obedience to the organization. But in truth, he wanted to capture her for himself. Trelawney's contemplations of Angela were interrupted when a dark, well-dressed man appeared on the giant conference video screen. \"Well! A formal meeting. Does this mean the praetorians are ready to take my offer seriously?\" The man gloated with a satisfied smile. \"Where's the girl?\" Trelawney asked with audible agitation in his voice. \"So hasty... First, you will agree to my terms and conditions...and most importantly, my price\" \"Our organization does not make deals with extortionists, especially amateurs...\" Trelawney sneered. \"If I am such an amateur, then why do I have within my possession the woman your entire organization has not been able to capture? I believe even you have failed at retaining her, Mr. Trelawney.\" Mr. Olivier interrupted \"Why should we even believe you have Angela? Stop wasting our time and show us the girl if what you say is true\" \"My pleasure Mr. Olivier, see for yourself...\" The video feed cut to Angela, whom was still in her night gown tied to the iron bed. \"She's quite lovely, it would be a shame if we cannot reach an agreement...\" \"My price is rather reasonable, I believe. 30 million dollars... You have 24 hours, after that, her condition becomes less... desirable...\" \"We won't pay for damaged goods... No harm is to come to her.\" Trelawney ordered with glaring eyes. \"The condition I deliver her in is entirely up to you, Trelawney.\" \" Contact me when you have the money...\" The screen suddenly went black, Trelawney's scowl still frozen where the man was a moment ago. Mr. Hearney broke the silence, \"Maybe we should just let him kill her, do we really need this girl? Perhaps he'd be doing us a favor...\" Trelawney turned sharply to him \"Angela Bennett is our one link to Sorcerer...We lose her, we lose any chance of finding him.\" \"Maybe we can use this situation to our advantage...\" Mr. Olivier mused aloud, as he stroked his chin, deep in thought. \"If Sorcerer is made aware that Angela has been captured, he will attempt to rescue her. We then can capture him and Angela simultaneously.\" \"That's an intriguing idea sir, but we still have no idea ourselves where she is.\" Trelawney said with a furrowed brow. \"That's why we let Sorcerer figure that out for us, Trelawney. Angela is only significant to us for her ties to Sorcerer. If we figure out a way to bait this extortionist on an unsecured transmission, Sorcerer will surely track him down for us. He will try to save her, and even if he fails and Angela dies, we still get him. He's all we need, and this situation may deliver him straight into our hands.\" Mr. Olivier said with an expression of satisfaction. \"sir...I...\" Trelawney interjected \"Yes, Trelawney?\" the chairman said with irritation in his voice. \"I believe Angela Bennett holds more value to us than just in finding Sorcerer. Her advanced skills could be a powerful asset to us...\" \"What makes you think she'd ever agree to join us Mr. Trelawney?\" Mr. Olivier sneered. \"I can be very...persuasive, sir\" Trelawney stated with a smug grin. \"Yes, and that has worked out so well in the past with her, hasn't it?...\" Mr. Olivier sarcastically scoffed. Trelawney, defeated, overted his gaze downward. \"We sacrifice the girl if necessary Trelawney! End of discussion...\" Mr. Olivier ordered as he abruptly stood and exited the conference room. The rest of the praetorians stood and followed behind the chairman. Each giving a glance to Trelawney before exiting. Trelawney was left alone, deep in conflicting thought as to what he should do next. ","Summary":" It was half past midnight and Angela was enjoying her usual cup of hot chamomile tea before bed.

This girl wasn't at all what he was expecting. From the way Marissa had described her, he had thought she'd be primitive-like. Practically feature-less and homely, with the intelligence of an ape. But she wasn't. Not quite. She wasn't the usual definition of 'beautiful', per se. But for his peculiar taste she nearly fit the bill. She had long, golden hair, and piercing blue eyes. Her skin was admittedly more 'detailed' than he would prefer, but not overly freckled or porous. And her body, though not girly in proportions, had a certain appeal to it, if he were being honest with himself. Normally, Isaacs was never one to get distracted on a job. He'd always thought himself too good for that. But because this girl was a special case; because she was different from any other target he'd dealt with; he let his guard slip. But only for a second. Consequently, that was all it took for her to out maneuver him and land a punch square on his face. Effectively knocking him straight. Isaacs then watched her retreating figure as she scaled a tall freight box, and disappeared into the night. Gently touching the spot along his jawline where her fist had made contact, he winced at the intense pain that shot through him. Despite this, however, a small smirk still managed to creep up on his lips, and bring color into his cheeks. She was much more than any old 'project', that he was sure of. Despite her incredible combatant skills and strength, she was still a girl. And as far as he was concerned she couldn't out best him. Not in a fair fight, anyway.

Enjoy ^.^ Soft golden light from the small reading lamps spilled over the various plane riders as they whiled away the hours until they landed. Many were asleep, fatigue from both jet lag and a job well done lulling them to spread out on the butter soft couches of the private jet and catch up on a few hours of sleep. However two of the occupants were at the back of the plane, one mulling over a small netbook while the other was trying to coax his friend to relax. \"We're done, habibti . We can relax now,\" Dark liquid eyes moved from the pale form to the netbook that was taking up so much of her attention. \"I'm not tiered, Gabir.\" Gabir shook his head at the all too familiar line. \"You never are, Hanna. But that does not mean you should not sleep. Rest.

Their last. Gabir took a moment to savor that thought. For too long he and the others, survivors of the Galinka project, had been trying to find others like themselves and stop various agencies from hunting them further. It had taken some time, but they now were able to live without fear of dying or worse. Now all that was left to decide what they wanted to do with their freedom. Of the five that still remain three of them had homes that they wished to return to, lives that they wanted to pick back up without the constant threat over hanging them. But he and Hanna did not have such things to go back to. \"You both should be resting,\" A deep voice said off to Gabir's left. They both looked up into the face of Matthew Collur. Once a top level CIA operative and part of the Galinka program, he had been sick at what had happened and the mass killing of the children and parents. He had taken his own charge, Jennica, and ran; much like Erik had done with Hanna. But where Erik had stolen away to a far off cabin in the middle of an icy tundra, Matthew had stayed closer to society, on the fringes to keep from the CIA's radar, but still within reach of his contacts and resources. Over the years he had cultivated both the wealth and resources that they would later come to use to track down others like Hanna and Gabir. Unfortunately of the twenty children that had originally been part of the program only five remained, all lucky enough that their handlers, parents, saw the mass slaughter of children and innocent women as wrong. \"I'm trying to get her to sleep, but she isn't listening to me,\" Gabir replied, glancing at Hanna who was glaring at her friend before turning to look up at Matthew. \"I can't sleep. I have too much on my mind so I'm trying to jot everything down,\" Hanna replied, turning back to her work. Matthew smiled softly as he reached out and lowered the lid. Blue eyes, questioning and dark, looked up at him. \"We're done Hanna. That's all that matters. Reports will be written, final touches will be made, but you're free.\" Hanna didn't reply, instead looking down at the computer lid. Free. Freedom. Not having to answer to anyone or anything, not having to fly out at all hours for missions, or go into a situation knowing she may not come out. Free. She didn't know how to feel about that. She caressed the keys beneath her fingertips, feeling their warm and worn smooth surfaces. No more reports to be written up or comuniques to see to. They had won their freedom, after so long. They didn't have to be pawns in some political game. \"Free.\" The word was said so softly Matthew almost didn't hear it, but the desolate tone and turned down eyes sent anger pouring into his stomach. Girls Hanna's age should have been worrying about boys and school and finding a job. Not learning what it was to be like everyone else, even with the simplest things. They all had to learn that in one way or another, but Erik had isolated Hanna so severely she had had not contact with anyone until her very early teens. He reached over and covered her hand drawing large blue eyes up to him. \"You are. And you have the whole world to live in now. No more hiding. No more fighting.\" Hanna nodded, a small smile twitching the corner of her lips. \"Okay.\" \"So get some sleep. You two are going to stay with me and Jennica for a time until you get your feet under you. So don't worry about that.\" \"Great. Free room and board,\" Gabir grinned broadly, rubbing his hands together like a little kid that just got another dessert. The childish behavior broke through Hanna's resolve and she laughed at her friend's antics. \"Not entirely free. You will have to find a job and school,\" Matthew said, unable to hold back his own smile. Ever since finding him four years ago he could only think of a handful of time he had seen Gabir without a smile on his face or laughter in his voice. He was always the first to crack a joke to ease tension and didn't ever need an excuse to throw together a party. 'We're alive! That's celebration enough.' \"Fine fine.\" The exaggerated pout on his lips belied any true aggravation. Matthew stood from his seat and looked back at the two. \"Sleep. We'll be in London soon and move from there.\" Both nodded and bid him goodnight as he walked to the front of the plane where Jennica was sleeping. \"So, are you finally going to turn in?\" Gabir asked, turning back to Hanna. Hanna nodded, shutting down the computer and stowing it in the satchel by her feet. Both stretched out and turned off the light, cloaking both of them in darkness. Hanna took a deep breath, letting it out and feeling her tension slip with it. Next to her she could already hear Gabir's soft snores. For a moment her mind wandered back to when they had first met and the snoring had kept her awake endlessly. She chuckled as she remembered one time nearly knocking him off the bed to get him to turn over. Her mind moved from the memory of Gabir's indignant sleepy face, to another that she had not seen for seven years. The only other person besides Gabir and Erik that she had allowed close if only for a short time. Green eyes sparkling alight with campfire and music. A warm smile shadowed beneath a blanket. An equally warm hand reached out and rested on her shoulder. \"Rest habiibi. Keep that image of her, but sleep.\" Gabir's voice was gentle, not breaking the quiet that had fallen in the cabin. \"It will make for pleasant dreams I think.\" Hanna turned towards him, barely making out his dark eyes in the shadows. \"Do you think we'll make it?\" Gabir's hand moved from her shoulder to clasp her hand, giving it an encouraging squeeze. \"After all of the things we've been through, living a regular life,\" Gabir paused and the white of his teeth became visible as he grinned. \"And finding your lady love will be a piece of cake.\" Hanna was thankful for the darkness as it helped to hide the flush brought on by her friend's words. She turned over, never losing contact with her friend, but gave him a small nudge with her other hand. \"She's not my lady love.\" \"Not yet. Sleep.\" Hanna smiled and closed her eyes, this time feeling fatigue finally come. She was swept into peaceful slumber with the comfort of Gabir so close and the warm familiarity of green eyes watching through her dreams. habibti - beloved (meant in friendship) ","Summary":" Notes: I don't own Hanna or any of the characters from the movie, but the OCs are all mine.

Lucia walked in quick confident strides. She could tell she was being followed. The follower was a middle aged man with a goatee. '6ft, weight undetermined, Caucasian, most likely a hired thug, judging by the cheap jeans and leather jacket.' She listed the information in her head, which she gathered from a quick glance as she was pretending to tie her runners. A normal person would feel trapped. Their palms would sweat, their stomach would slosh undigested material around otherwise causing 'butterflies', perhaps they would try to run or shake him off, perhaps they might go into a public area and hide amongst the crowds. Would they be afraid? Yes. Wouldn't you? Lucia felt none of these things. She hadn't even a developed concept of them. A fourteen year old young woman, unarmed, on her own and she felt nothing. Her mind just went through the procedure. \"Follower is unsuspicious. No other potential followers recognised. \" She was in a crowd. Busy pedestrians were on their way to work and other casual duties. She saw what she needed. \"Elderly pedestrian. Female. Dependant on walking stick. Small handbag on right shoulder.\" The old woman was hobbling along, looking quite lost. Lucia tracked her movements as a fox tracks a wounded rodent. The pensioner meanwhile clutched her bag cautiously as the crowd pushed her around like a plastic bag caught in the breeze. Lucia felt no pity. She saw opportunity. The woman pushed through the crowd to a garda, who stood by his car, carelessly chatting on his mobile to someone Lucia didn't care about. When the elder was but a metre from the garda, she wheeled around and pretended to just notice the follower who, realising he had been spotted, began to thrash through the sea of people. She ran at the woman. 'What are you-'was all the old woman had time to say before the youth kicked the stick from under her to causing her to lose her balance. Lucia made a useless effort to pull the handbag from the lady's grasp. The garda spotted the commotion and sprinted over to the scene. He grabbed onto Lucia's waist and pulled her off. Lucia had to concentrate to stop herself from pushing free from the garda's clutches. 'What are ye at?' He shouted into her eardrum, as he dragged her away from the shocked elder. Someone from the crowd moved over to the baffled woman and helped her up. Blood oozed from a shallow cut on her thumb. Lucia probably scratched it in the tussle. The dismayed woman looked at the girl, her creased face filled with venom. 'How dare you!' she spat. Lucia began to cry. 'I-I am sorry. He said he'd kill me if I didn't. Please don't let him hurt me.' She wailed. The garda screwed up his face. 'Easy there. Whose gona hurt ya?' She pointed at someone in the crowd. He had a goatee and wore cheap jeans. He froze in the middle of bounding toward them. He then turned around and plunged through the crowd in haste. 'Stop!' The garda called, releasing Lucia and chasing after the thug. She was free now and nobody was following her. The old woman waved her stick, encouraging the garda. 'Go on get him! Bloody hooligan!' The old woman seemed a lot more confident now. Perhaps it was just being lost which unnerved her. Nobody was watching so she stopped crying. She felt something. It was like her heart was sinking and pressure was building in her head. She wanted to properly cry now, her breathing became sharp gasps. She must have felt it before. Lucia was never able to identify emotions. It was difficult for her. The emotion she was feeling was obviously a sense of frustration, but she did not know that. She had grown up giving names to what she felt instead of relating them with other people. She looked again at the old woman, who was still watching the garda chase the thug into the sunset. She decided to name the feeling- lost. She felt lost. She wanted to go somewhere quiet now. 'Hold on there.' Someone said in a commanding voice, grabbing her by the arm. It was another garda. He wore the signature high visibility jacket. His face had a fat moustache filled with crumbs. In his free hand was a steaming cup of hot coffee. 'I believe you owe this woman an apolo-.' This was as far as he got. Lucia felt what she called orange. It was her favourite colour when she was younger and when she felt orange she did bad things so she named it orange, so as to make herself feel better. It had no effect though, she still did \"bad things\". In a quick move she freed herself and attempted to knock the cup into his ugly face. Her aim was to blind him but the hot tea only scalded his neck and arm. 'You little whore!' He yelped. She took a deep breath through her nose, smelling coffee and began to run. The garda chased after her like a bull in the Spanish bull fighting festival. The coffee had only succeeded in slowing him down. Lucia would have to outrun him. This wasn't easy because of the fact people get out the way when they see a guard running whilst no-one did the same with Lucia. In fact three people jumped out and tried to stop her. Those people got a fright and her fist in their guts. She came to some stairs and leaped down them. At the last step she tripped. Her body smashed against the pavement. Her shoulder stung and her palms had scratched against the pavement causing skin to peel. When she tried to move her ankle screamed in protest. It felt tender, even the slightest movement was agony. She could hear the patter of the garda puffing down the stairs. She held her breath and lifted her body up. She hobbled as fast as she could up to an old building site and stopped under a graffiti covered bridge. It was covered with beer cans and cigarette butts. It smelt of sewage. Lucia would have run further. She stopped when she saw a figure at the other side of the wide tunnel under the bridge. This figure had a goatee. He looked surprised at first but then happy. 'Fancy this darlin.' He said reaching into his jacket. He was foreign. His accent was West Virginian. She took a deep breath. She was determined to escape free. In that breath she noticed a faint smell among the sewage. It was coffee. She didn't even have to look behind to know that the garda was there. The man with the goatee took out a switch blade and clicked it. 'Well howdy there sir, I was just about to pick up my little sis from school when she went all skrits and I had to chase her all the way down here. Very sorry.' 'Yeah? Then what's the knife for?' The American frowned darkly. 'So I can gut ya like a fish when you come over here. Got it?' 'I am warning you. I will use this.' He said holding out a can of pepper spray. 'You think that'll stop me from stabbing your eyes out. Come on try it Irishman.' He taunted raising his hands. It was another opportunity. Lucia took advantage of it. With her good foot she propelled herself towards him and kneed the thug in the groin. He wailed and buckled. In the heat of the moment she forgot to move her head to the right and his forehead smashed into her. She bit her tongue; she tasted the iron tang of hot blood in her mouth. But she had to ignore it. Her hand shot out and palmed his face. It was a convenient way of giving your victim a concussion without the burden of hurting your knuckles. Her other hand grasped where he was holding the knife and she dug her nails into his skin. His grip loosened and the knife was now in her possession. She wasted no time, plunging the weapon where his diaphragm would be. She pushed him away and took a few steps back, keeping a safe distance. The American groaned. His knees buckled and he collapsed to the ground. She turned to the garda who held the spray in shaky hands. He opened and closed his mouth as if wanting to say something but lacking the words. Lucia took the knife and held it to her neck. 'W-wait don't.' 'I am tired of killing.' She announced, her words slightly slurred. Her accent was rich and almost unique. It surprised the garda. 'Put that down. You can stop killing. I will help you.' She looked at the pepper spray then back to the man's face. He took the hint and hitched spray back into his belt. 'Okay? Now put it down.' She stared at him for what seemed like an eternity. Slowly, she put the knife on the ground and stepped away from it. The garda walked over to her. 'Alright now. Where's your family?' Lucia leapt at his face. She bit into his cheek, feeling the blood dribble down her chin. She held on, grinding her teeth deeper into the soft flesh. She let go and reached for his belt as he held his hands up to his face and took the spray. The garda screamed almost inhumanly as she burned his wound. He held up his hands to stop it and flung out wildly. Lucia stopped when he was on the ground. Now she had to act fast. She approached the dying American. 'Why did you attack?' 'I just wanted to show you a good time.' The American gibbered, his face pale from blood loss. Lucia looked at his wound then at the pepper spray. She wondered something. The garda began to scream again. So she hobbled away. She had tried to clean up the blood in a nearby puddle. But it was dry and stuck to her clothes. The water had turned crimson. At least she had been prepared for this. She was taught how to survive. But she still needed her family. They were essential for now. But what should happen if they become a burden? Lucia needed to talk to Soot. She was like Lucia. She was family. Lucia hoped she wasn't dead yet. ","Summary":" WAITING Life is always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act.

There was a split second of disbelief when it happened, but he refrained from touching the kissed area of skin, for fear of disturbing the thin layer of lipstick that was undoubtedly there. Although it wouldn't be the first time that she had asked him for a favor, it would be the first time that she had begged him for one. And with that kiss, that simple peck on the cheek, she was indeed begging. Never before had she let those tender lips grace his pale cheek, not even when he had attempted to bribe her all those years ago. And even now, with the intense heat flooding his cheeks, and the wonderful aroma of her honey-scented breath fannning over his face, he could not believe that what he was feeling was real. He gasped quietly to himself, jerking his head ever so slightly to the right as he gripped the bar's countertop in an attempt to keep his knees from buckling right underneath him. She slowly pulled her face from his, eyes as lit as ever, and expression hard and serious. If that kiss didn't prove she meant business then nothing did, and his heart would be left to ache forevermore. But that, he knew, he could endure no longer. So he steadied himself, and took a deep breath. Whatever she was to ask of him, then and there, he'd do it. Whatever she wanted to seek would be sought , whoever she wanted to kill would be offed .

In fact, the only training they had, had came from the oldest member of their 'team'. They were an odd little band of fighters, sure enough. There was Issacs â€“ the leader â€“ Titch â€“ the muscles â€“ and Razor â€“ the brains. Issacs was the oldest of them; the one who had trained them. Truly...trained doesn't sound right, to fully describe the relationship between them. Issacs had practically raised them. There was a time long ago, when Titch wasn't Titch, Razer wasn't Razer, and Issacs wasn't a man who was â€“ basically â€“ insane. Titch used to be known as Viktor, and Razer as Dmitri. They were brothers, Viktor being the elder of the two. They didn't live in a nice community, where food was as easy to come by as air...no, they lived in an area that could only be a mere step above the sewers... O_.~â€¢*'*â€¢~._.~â€¢*'*â€¢~._.~â€¢*'*â€¢~._O A scrawny boy with dirty black hair glanced around the corner of a graffiti-marred building, eyes narrowed in concentration. There were several people around, though most looked to be asleep, or too-far-gone mentally to be concerned about. A dreadful smell wafted through the air, but the boy seemed unaffected by it. He slipped around the corner, a frown planted firmly on his serious features. The boy was indeed very thin, and quite dirty. A long grimy shirt seemed to be his only form of clothing. A small and quiet voice interrupted his concentration. \"Brat?\" it whispered in a thick accent. \"Brother?\" \"What is it? I am trying to concentrate!\" the older boy snapped in the same odd language the other voice had used. Another pale and gaunt face appeared, along with the same grubby clothes and mangy mane as the older boy. \"I am sorry, brother. Are you trying to find us food?\" The older boy closed his eyes, this sentence obviously upsetting him. \"You should not be concerned about such things.\" Though the boys were very similar in looks, the younger had an innocent look in his eyes. \"But brother-\" \"No. Go back to the shed.\" The younger boy complied. The older boy took a couple hesitant steps away from the building, blue eyes darting everywhere. Suddenly a scream rippled through the air, coming from the alley the younger boy had disappeared into. \"Dmitri!\" the older boy yelled, tearing back down the narrow passageway. He came to the end of it, where a small shack comprised of boxes and newspapers stood â€“ but he didn't concern himself with that. His little brother was pushed up against a dirt-caked wall by a large man â€“ a man whose hands were touching the younger boy. \"You there! Get the fuck away from my brother!\" the boy shouted. \"V-Viktor? He is hurting me...\" That was the last straw. Viktor lunged at the man, beating him and clawing at his arms â€“ basically doing anything he could to get the man away from Dmitri. Despite his emaciated form, Viktor knew how to use his small amount of strength to his advantage. The man stumbled back, blinking slowly in shock. Dmitri yanked on his underclothes, pulling them back into place, and adjusting his shirt. Viktor stood protectively in front of his brother, as the man advanced again. \"Oh, bu' wa'n't through wit' 'im yet...\" The dirty man said. Dmitri whimpered, gathering fistfuls of his brother's shirt into his small hands. \"You are done with him. Leave.\" The man kept advancing, a nasty gleam in his eyes. Viktor started shaking, pushing himself and his little brother farther into the wall. \"I said l-leave!\" The man was so close now- A sharp splitting sound echoed through the alley, and the man stopped walking. The boy's froze, as the man turned towards the mouth of the alley, a single word leaving his mouth. \"You...\" The disgusting man collapsed, blood pooling around him. Dmitri curled into his brother's side, arms hugging him tightly. Viktor, however, looked towards the opening, eyes widening. A man stood there. He was dressed sharply and cleanly, unlike the man that had hurt Dmitri. He had short blond hair, and was rather muscly. He was also holding a gun. The new man strode down the alleyway, gun still at the ready. He pointed it at the body, kicking the side of the corpse. He nodded his head sharply, obviously pleased, before turning the gun on the two brothers. Viktor maneuvered them around, so Dmitri was hidden behind him. The man just stared at them with stony eyes, mouth pressed into a thin line. \"Please,\" Viktor pleaded in his native tongue. \"Please, we mean no harm.\" The man blinked, before uttering something in a language unknown to the boys. He tried saying some things in various other languages. Finally, the man said, \"English?\" \"Da, I know a little,\" Viktor said quietly. Dmitri was quaking horribly behind him, a few small moans the only indication that he was in pain. The blond man slowly lowered his gun, looking at the boys. He noticed how undernourished and dirty they were, and his eyes softened slightly as he kneeled down to their height. \"Where do you come from. Have you any parents?\" \"No...we live in the shed,\" Viktor said quietly, nodding his head towards the stack of trash. \"I see... My name is Issacs, by the way,\" the man â€“ Issacs â€“ said. Viktor bit his lip, before saying, \"My name is Viktor, and my brother is called Dmitri.\" A large blue eye poked around his brother, tears still swimming in it. \"Ah. It is a pleasure to meet you...Are you all right?\" Issacs asked, adjusting something around his ear. \"I am fine...but that man...he hurt my brother...\" Issacs's eyes darkened. \"I see...\" He yanked something out of his ear, tossing it aside. \"Perhaps...perhaps I can help you two...\" Dmitri came out of hiding, looking at the man. Viktor bit his lip, unsure. \"M-Mister Issacs? Do...d-do you have any f-food?\" Dmitri asked hesitantly. Viktor set a warning hand on his brother's shoulder. Issacs gave a small, almost sad smile. \"No, I have none on me...but...at my house I have a lot...would you perhaps like some?\" Dmitri nodded quickly, reaching for the man's hand. Viktor stopped him. \"I am being sorry, Mister Issacs. We cannot go with you...\" Issacs sighed. \"I understand. I will bring you food though; I promise.\" And he did. For a few weeks, the blond man brought them food and blankets. The boys didn't notice how he became unkept; they felt safe and protected for the first time in their life. O_.~â€¢*'*â€¢~._.~â€¢*'*â€¢~._.~â€¢*'*â€¢~._O Eventually, the boys trusted Issacs enough to live with him. They didn't stay anywhere for long; Issacs was on the run, you see. But it made no difference. Issacs raised them, trained them, and cared for them. They got their nicknames, and they became killers-for-hire. They got good. They got mentally scarred and shattered. Somehow, though, Dmitri was able to keep a little bit of his childlike innocence. He smiled, laughed, and enjoyed candy. He laughed at movies, read books when he could, and even flirted with girls on occasion. That's why it hurt the other two men more than any physical wound could, to see him dead, deep slashes across his chest. Viktor just stood there, arm holding his side from where the metal shipping box had slammed into him. Issacs stared at the youngest boy, his face a mask of sadness and anger. \"She will die. Hanna will die.\" Viktor said simply, an unwilling tear running down his scarred face. Issacs picked up the smaller boy, Dmitri's blood tainting the bright jumpsuit. \"She will indeed,\" he said, hugging the dead boy close.

Movie spoilers, obviously. Summary: Sophie looks for Hanna in everyone, yet she's still surprised when she finally sees her. Femslash. I wrote this a long time ago and figured I might as well post it. That summer touring the Mediterranean was like a dream in her life. No one in her family ever discussed what had happened. It was safe to say they'd never go back to Spain again. Once they'd arrived back at their dull home in Britain, Sophie had gathered her courage and done an internet search. There was no information about a \"Hanna\" with no last name. But there had been an article on Grimmoire House in Berlin, of a set of unsolved murders: three men dead in a park nearby and a man found tortured to death inside the abandoned amusement park. And last, an American woman Marissa Viegler, found dead at the parkâ€”wounded by an arrow and shot in the head with a bullet. She had nightmares about what had happened, about her friend, Hanna, killing that man with a knife. Dead, just like that. She'd probably done the same to all those people in Berlin. But where was Hanna? Despite herselfâ€”her helpless anger at not understanding what had happened, about who her friend wasâ€”Sophie was glad Hanna hadn't been found dead. But then summer had ended, and she went back to school. Her family continued its silence on the strange events of that summer, and Sophie began to stop thinking so constantly about Hanna. Eventually it just faded away, at least until she saw a painfully skinny blonde girl or heard someone shout, \"Hanna\" to a school chum. If only Hanna hadn't been so sincere, so sweet, so painfully naÃ¯ve. If only she hadn't kissed Sophieâ€”the first kiss in Sophie's life that had actually meant something, the one that sent shivers all the way to her toes and made her catch her breath. If only Hanna had done to her what she'd done to that Spanish boy, then maybe Sophie could let it all go instead of forgetting for a little while only to suddenly feel everything rush back in memory. But, even those sharp reminders faded somewhat. Especially through university, when she was busy with classes and girlfriends and life swept her away when it moved faster than ever. Until one winter night when she was walking along a busy street on her way to a get together with her friends, she turned her head and saw her. The long, wild blonde hair was still down, though not as unkempt as before. She was still painfully thin, wearing Converse and jeans and a thin hoodie as if the cold was nothing to her. In the red and orange luminescence of the bars along the street, she could make out her sharp, clear eyes and the dusting of freckles across her cheeks. Those eyes were riveted on a group of street musicians playing for the crowd. (The memory arose, of Hanna sitting so still, rapt in the Spanish musicians. She'd sensed it more keenly than the kiss she'd let that Spanish boy take.) Sophie stepped away from her friends and said weakly, \"Hanna.\" Hanna turned her head, saw her, and just looked at her. Then she gave the faintest smile before turning on her heel and disappearing into the street. \"Wait!\" She didn't know why she'd shouted that word, not when Hanna could be a murderer or a spy or even some sort of mutant. The same instinct that compelled her to shout after Hanna also churned her feet forward, and she ran into the street, shouting again, \"Hanna!\" She was blind to her surroundings, and a car blared its horn as tires squealed. Then there was an iron grip on her shoulder, tugging her sharply off her feet and into the safety of the curb. \"Hanna,\" she gasped, reaching out touch Hanna's face. The same placid face, with the same penetrating eyes. Then Hanna turned her gaze across the street. Sophie followed her gaze and saw the knot of her friends shouting after her. \"Let's go. Can we go somewhere?\" Sophie wished her voice weren't so desperate. Hanna studied her. Then she nodded. She released Sophie's shoulder from her grip, and Sophie caught her arm, thinking of the regret she'd had since she'd realized she was \"one of those lesbians\" that she hadn't pressed for a stronger kiss, hadn't slipped her hand between Hanna's legs and shown her what it was like. Hanna walked them to the subway, where they took the tram across the city. Hanna sat with the stillness of an animal, not stiff but simply unmoving. She watched everything with her eyes. She kept that animal awareness in their short walk to her apartment building, and she surveyed everything within her home with the guarded look of someone looking for something out of place. \"Are they still after you?\" The placid face twitched. Hanna shook her head. \"No.\" \"There were four men dead,\" Sophie whispered. \"In Berlin. And that woman. That woman came and talked to us, Hanna. She said your father killed your mother and he wanted to kill you too. I didn't believe her, but Waltâ€¦ Walt told her where you were going.\" \"It's alright,\" Hanna said. Sophie shivered a heavy weight of guilt lifted from her shoulders. \"You were okay? Did she come after you? Did she mean it, about your father?\" \"She killed my mother,\" Hanna replied. Sophie let out an involuntary moan. \"And my father. But I killed her. She was the only person who knew about me. No one has tried to find me again.\" She was weak and lightheaded. And a little surprised someone like Hanna owned a couch. She sank into it gratefully, feeling her stomach slowly settle. \"I'm sorry I followed you. I'm sorry I ran away from you. I'd never seen anything like that. You just killed him. Just like that.\" \"He was going to hurt you.\" Hanna slowly sat down next to Sophie on the couch. She stared at her hands and seemed to vibrate with pent up energy. \"Are you still my friend, Sophie?\" she finally asked. There was a catch in her voice as if she was nervous about the answer. \"I don't know,\" Sophie whispered. \"I just know I've thought about you so much since then. I was scared of you, and I was scared for you. I'veâ€¦ I've never thought of anyone the way I've thought of you, not even my girlfriends or my best friends. Or my family.\" \"Did she hurt you?\" Hanna asked haltingly. \"No.\" Sophie shook her head. \"She just asked us a lot of questions about you. And Walt told her where you were going and she just let us go. I think my parents thought she was going to kill us. I did. Nobody talks about it at all now.\" \"I'm sorry I put you in danger.\" \"We weren't hurt,\" Sophie said again. Finally Hanna met her eyes. Sharp blue, with such lovely dark to blonde eyelashes. \"You're sure you're safe?\" \"Yes.\" After a moment, Hanna got up and went to the kitchenette of the apartment. Sophie held her breath, remembering the skinned squirrelsâ€”and the horrible sense of betrayal at waking alone after such an emotionally intimate night. (She remembered their feet brushing, the feel of Hanna's hand on her face, the sweet scent of her breath under that blanket.) When Hanna withdrew a plate of Chinese leftovers, she let out a sigh of relief. \"I was afraid you'd pull out a rat or something.\" A slow, honest smile. \"I'm not sure I trust the safety of rat flesh in the city.\" \"You're so weird.\" Sophie laughed softly, but her laughter turned into tears. \"I thought I'd never see you again. And I'm so glad I have, that I am.\" Hanna settled up against her and folded Sophie into her arms. And Sophie turned her face to Hanna's and kissed her. It was shaky and odd, but those tingles were full-blown shivers of passion, and Sophie hadn't felt this kind of pleasure even having sex with any of her exes. \"I think I'm in love with you, Hanna,\" she admitted. She drew back and held her breath, waiting for Hanna's reaction. Hanna smiled. Then she blushed and giggled. And then she leaned in for another kiss. Distantly, Sophie heard the microwave beep, but by that time they'd lain down on the couch. Hanna's hands rubbed her scalp and massaged her hips. Sophie gasped. \"Oh. Have you done this before?\" \"No,\" Hanna replied. She pulled off Sophie's shirt and settled back against her, her hands now occupied with Sophie's breasts. It was wonderful. Better than Sophie had ever imagined sex could ever be. There was passion, but through it all there was that quiet stillness of emotional intimacy that they'd shared that night under the blanket in their tent. Quiet words punctuated by soft touch, in a soft cocoon under the comforter on Hanna's bed. Sophie awoke a little while later. She was alone in bed. In a panic, she fell out from under the warm comforter and caught Hanna, standing at the door with a bag over her shoulder. \"You aren't going, are you?\" she asked, her tone shaky and hurt. Hanna's mouth opened, then she sighed. \"You're safe. You said you were safe. Why are you leaving?\" Hanna seemed to look inside herself. Then she smiled almost ruefully and dropped her backpack on the floor of the apartment. \"Do you want something to eat?\" Sophie stamped her foot. \"I want you to promise me you won't leave again!\" \"I promise,\" Hanna said firmly. And that was that. \"I can make some waffles,\" she said clearly. \"I'll eat part of yours.\" Hanna cocked an eyebrow. \"I'll make you one.\" \"I can't eat the whole thing.\" \"Then I'll finish it.\" Well, she had to be pushy about something, and if it was sharing food, Sophie could deal with that. Oh, god, it felt like she'd already resigned herself to being with Hanna. Being with her, which sounded permanent. A few minutes later, Sophie held a plate with a large, golden waffle on it. The syrup bottle sat between them on the bed. Hanna watched Sophie as she ate, a soft smile on her lips that with any other person, Sophie would distrust. With Hanna, though, Sophie just smiled back. True to her word, Hanna finished her waffle and began to eat the majority of Sophie's. \"You enjoy eating so much,\" she said at last. \"That hasn't changed.\" \"I never knew food could be so expressive.\" \"Expressive?\" Hanna nodded. \"In the forest, there was not variety. Not like here.\" \"So if I say you must have grown up in the woods, it's true.\" Hanna laughed and nodded. She set her empty plate on the bedside table and hugged her knees, smiling at Sophie as she watched her. She blushed faintly. \"I didn't think sex could be so expressive either.\" \"I didn't either,\" Sophie admitted softly. She trailed her fingers down Hanna's hand, brushing over scars on her knuckles and the long, strong length of one finger. Sophie shivered despite herself, remembering the sureness of those hands in several capacities. \"What do you do?\" Sophie finally asked. \"Things. I work here and there.\" \"Doing what?\" Hanna shrugged. \"I worked at a music store. And I worked at a mechanic's. Now I'm working in a kitchen at a French restaurant. They let me eat free.\" \"They let you cook?\" \"No. I bus tables and clean up the kitchen. They let me cut the meat too.\" \"No shit,\" Sophie had a mind to say. She couldn't stop her grin. Hanna smiled back. \"So you live here now?\" \"Yes. I like it.\" \"It's funny. I've been here since I started university in this town. I wish I had seen you before.\" \"I've seen you,\" Hanna said. She looked over her knees almost shyly at Sophie. \"Sometimes.\" \"Will you keep seeing me?\" she asked. Hanna's brow furrowed. \"I want to keep seeing you. Like this,\" Sophie spelled out. She twined her fingers in Hanna's. \"Do you want to too?\" \"Yes.\" Hanna almost bit the word off in her haste to say it. It reassured Sophie a little bit. That maybe Hanna had thought of her as much as she'd thought of Hanna. Come what may, at least they had that. It would be enough. -end- ","Summary":" Cocoon Fandom: Hanna (movie) Pairing: Sophie/Hanna Rating: T Warnings: I'm assuming a happier end t"},{"Movie":"Hanna","Title":"The MMA Way","Author":"Ififall","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9912959","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Strong Language.

She raised the gun and Erik twisted her arm. Marissa dropped it. Erik leapt on top of her banging her face into the sidewalk. By the time she turned on her back Erik pointed her own gun in her face. Hanna heard the gun-shot and dropped to her knees on the grass. The grass tickled her palms and she just wanted to lie on the ground forever stop time and rewind it. But she couldn't. Now she was on her own and knew that she would just have to keep running until Marissa found her. She had no idea what had happened to Sophie and her family, so she went to stay with Knepfler. He asked her where Erik was but she wouldn't answer. \"Let me make you a waffle. You'll have a cooked egg this time my dear\" Knepfler said raising a frying pan in the air. Knepfler was like the eccentric Uncle she'd never had. She liked Listening to him talk about his job, his life, his hobbies, his friends and her Mother. Knepfler described Johanne like a Princess, like she was almost too good to be true. Hanna would have stayed longer, but when she found out that Marissa's thugs were onto him, she told Knepfler that she had to leave. \"Sweetheartâ€¦..noâ€¦.\" Knepfler said, shaking his head, but she packed her bags that night. She found Knepfler's email address under her pillow. When she figured out how to make one of her own, she'd contact him. Hanna managed to charm a farmer and his family, when she helped track down one of their sheep. They offered her a room if she helped with the chores. She agreed, but all that hard labour wasn't enough for her. In her spare time she went to the city and quickly joined a gym. She was hitting a punching bag when she noticed some guy on a treadmill. She looked at the speed it was almost a level twenty. She'd never seen that before she punched the bag a few times before going on the treadmill next to him. She deliberately went faster to get his attention. \"Woah\" The guy said looking at her speed level. \"You're fast too\" Hanna said. The guy shrugged and kept running. While running next to the guy, she saw advertisement for roommates. But she didn't think anything of it until she went back to her farm. Marissa had gotten to the farming family. They'd all been shot, even the teenagers. Hanna went back to the gym and called the number on the \"Room-mates wanted\" flyer. \"Yeah?\" The guy said. \"Hiâ€¦I'm looking for a room to rentâ€¦ummâ€¦.can we meet?\" She asked. \"Yeahâ€¦I'm here\" The guy said Hanna looked around at saw the tread-mill guy holding up his phone. The guy introduced himself as Nick and they sat down in the gym cafÃ©. \"Soâ€¦.need a room?\" Nick asked. \"Yesâ€¦.quickly\" Hanna told him. \"You work?\" Nick asked. \"Noâ€¦.but there are adverts on the gym window\" She said. Trying not to appear rude Nick asked her where she was from. Hanna gave him her trained answer. \"I lived in Leipzig, population zero point seven million peoples. We lived at number seven, Vicenza Platz. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I used to go to school at The Klaus College Gymnazium and my best friends were Rudy Gunter and Clara Scheitz. Do you like Dogs? I had a dog called Trudy\" She said. Nick nodded. \"Soâ€¦ummâ€¦.if I don't callâ€¦then ummâ€¦..bad news\" Nick told her. He didn't call but that didn't stop Hanna from setting up camp across the street from his place. Nick knew what she was trying to do, but he couldn't do anything until he saw her fighting skills. Some guy had taken Hanna's phone, before Nick came out to help she kicked the guy in the chest and threw him on the ground. After the guy ran away Nick checked up on her. \"You into MMA?\" Nick asked. \"Kind of\" Hanna said. \"You should meet someone\" Nick said. After a recommendation from Nick Diaz, Hanna was sharing a place with UFC Fighter Miesha Tate. She was pretty and girly. At first glance Hanna never would have guessed that she was a fighter. Miesha trained Six days week at the gym and invited Hanna to come with her. Hanna enjoyed it and it wasn't long before she got a sponsor who assigned her a manager. Within a Month she had her first MMA match. It was against a girl called Jan Finney. It was easy for Hanna she able to take her down and dominate her. She won over Finney in round two by punches. She screamed as the Referee held up her hand. Herself, Miesha and her friends went out to celebrate. As it was her first match, she invited Nick, just to say thanks. \"Can't stay\" Nick told her as he drank his bottled water. \"That's okayâ€¦.is your Little Brother here?\" Hanna asked. \"Ummmâ€¦Miesha told me about him\" Hanna said. \"No, my coach is\" Nick said pointing at a guy in a hat. Hanna thought she recognised him and went over to say hello. \"Hiâ€¦so you train Nick?\" Hanna asked Nick's coach slowly. \"Yes, Nick Diaz has potential. He could be the best\" The coach said. Hanna recognised the voice. But it couldn't be him. She reached for his hat, but the coach pushed her arm away and tripped her up.

Marissa, the proper Marissa, lies dead at her feet, red hair splayed around her like a halo. Her father is dead too, even her grandmother. Her mother has been dead for years. Her father-who-is-not-her-father is dead, her mother is dead, Marissa is dead, her grandmother is dead, her mission is complete. She doesn't know what comes next. She hasn't trained for this, not without her father. In these last few days she's already learnt exactly how out of touch with the real world she is, no matter how beautiful it is. She doesn't understand any of it, how it works. She only understands the next kill, her next job. And she already knows that is wrong. She is wrong. Her medical records tell her that - abnormal. There is nothing left of her, nothing that she understands. She doesn't understand any of it. What can she do now? Hanna stands there in the amusement park, Marissa at her feet, and can only think of one name, one place to go now that everything is done. Sophie. When she closes her eyes sometimes she screams. Her mother and father had never forgiven her for encouraging Hanna to join them, not after the night they spent under the watch of the men with guns. Sometimes Sophie wonders if the government wanted to kill her for what she saw that night, only she was grateful that they hadn't. She had never been so angry with her brother as when he'd told the red headed woman where Hanna was headed, the one with a lethal smile and razor teeth, and the gun that gleamed in the darkness. Sophie wondered if Hanna was still alive. She wondered if the red head was still alive. She wondered how much longer she would be alive. Her parents heard her scream sometimes, and next thing she knows she's having regular meeting with a psychiatrist. But this psychiatrist is used to handling things like the deaths of terminally ill parents and the suicide of friends. Not a fifteen year old that slides a knife through another person's throat like she's cutting butter. Sophie has a bit too much fun dragging the memory out, just to watch the psychiatrist's knuckles turn white as she clutches at the table in front of her. But she doesn't tell the psychiatrist that it isn't Hanna she's afraid of. There has always been some sort of electricity between the pair, something neither of them could identify, that Sophie suspected Hanna had never even understood. Even Sophie isn't quite sure what it is, this bond between the pair of them. She isn't afraid of Hanna, what she saw that night. Instead she sees Hanna turning to her when she calls, and missing knife that sinks into her gut, blood spewing out over the pavement. In her dreams Hanna yanks the knife back out, drives it into her chest and then backs away from Sophie. A mirror always appears then and she looks into her own face, blood splattered and horrified and watches Hanna run through the mirror, away from her and that terrified look on her face. Sophie is alone. At other times she doesn't pull the knife out of her gut, sliding to the floor, and when Sophie reaches her she doesn't have a pulse, her cheeks whiter than ever. On those days she screams louder than ever. Only parts of these aren't a dream. Hanna hadn't run from her, Sophie had, but the look on her face had been the same; and she can still see the sadness in Hanna's eyes as she'd backed away. Tonight is no different. She wakes up gasping for breath, feeling as though she is sinking. She doesn't feel alone. \"Hello?\" She calls softly into the night. There is no response and Sophie feels silly despite herself, shifting herself more comfortably in her bed. \"Hello,\" a familiar voice says back. Sophie almost falls out of bed. Hanna floats like a wraith, into the sliver of light that slides through the gap in the curtains. She looks like a ghost and Sophie feels the urge to touch her, to feel her blood under the skin in spite of her paleness. She doesn't look to have changed at all, not one bit. She still has her accent, and her blonde hair, and that almost permanently puzzled look. \"Hanna...\" Sophie breaths like a prayer. \"Hello Sophie.\" Sophie launches herself at the other girl, feeling the hands tighter on her like they were ready to snap her neck if she made any sudden movements. She stills, but somehow is unafraid. Hanna knows that and doesn't know why. She can feel Sophie's pulse beneath her fingers but it is steady and slow, not at all worried, in spite of the dangerous position she is in. She supposes this is trust. She doesn't know what to think of this. Slowly, ever so slowly, Sophie slides her hands up over Hanna's and rests them there for a moment before prising Hanna's fingers away. \"Are you alright?\" \"I am fine.\" \"I'm glad.\" She puts a hand to Hanna's pale cheek. \"I was worried about the red headed woman.\" \"You don't have to be. Not anymore,\" Hanna says clinically, and Sophie can already guess so she doesn't ask. \"Are you alright?\" Hanna has a considering look on her face, like she's trying to work it out for herself. \"No. Not yet. But I will be.\" Sophie pulls Hanna down beside her. \"What do we do?\" Hanna asks barely more than a whisper. \"I tell my parents you're staying. Then we do whatever you want to.\" \"Music,\" Hanna says into the silence. \"I'd like to listen to music.\" \"First thing tomorrow,\" Sophie confirms, brushing a kiss on the blonde girls forehead. They fall asleep holding hands and Sophie can feel Hanna's pulse underneath the friendship bracelet she gave her. She is not alone. Hanna is alive.

Open your life, open your hands. ~ \"I don't want to live a small life\" by Mary Oliver The forest is not silent in the aftermath of the gunshot. Around her, Hanna can hear the flutter of a dozen wings as birds take to the sky. A few stay in the trees but shriek in alarm. She stands there long after the birds have fled or settled back on their perches. The only sounds then are the rustling of the leaves on the trees and her slow, even breaths. Her right side throbs from where the bullet grazed her; she presses her free hand where it hurts the most, feels her blood, warm and sticky, where it's seeped through her clothes. The gun is heavy in her hand, but she doesn't let go. The weight of it, the pain in her side, both momentarily ground her and ease the empty feeling in her heart, in her head. Her grandmother is dead. Mr. Grimm is dead. Her father who was not her biological father is dead. Marissa is dead. Her already small world, composed of family, enemies, and allies has dwindled toâ€” Sophie. It is, Hanna thinks, entirely possible that Sophie and her family are dead. They spent too much time with her, became liabilities. If they are dead, then there are four more deaths on her conscience. Hanna remembers the warmth of Sophie's lips against hers, the candy-sweet taste of her mouth. Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles. Hanna had thought kissing would be difficult when she read that in her book, but it had been easy, kissing Sophie. Hanna wipes her prints off the gun with a part of her shirt not stained by her own blood and drops the gun next to Marissa's body. She's not going to hurt anyone else, not ever. After a moment, she wipes her prints from the arrow as well. Then she turns away. Let those that find Marissa's body bury her; Hanna will not waste her strength. Hanna will bury her father and tend to her wounds, and then she will look for Sophie and her family. If they are dead, she will bury them as well. (Although perhaps they would have preferred cremation; she will have to study the preference rates of cremation versus burial for Great Britain.) If they are alive, she willâ€” She pauses, her mind blank. Her father had taught her to survive in the wild, to speak many languages, to defend herself, to kill. He had not taught her what to do once Marissa was dead. Perhaps he had not known himself. Then again, perhaps he had thought he would survive and they could learn together what came next. Her future stretches out before her, her path uncertain and full of decisions that only she can make for herself. Hanna takes in another breath, lets it out slowly. It is strange, she finds, having choices, being able to decide between more than two options (flip the switch or don't, kill Marissa or die). She speaks her options softly to the warm air. \"Find Sophie. Discover more about my DNA. Listen to as much music as I can.\" Each choice seems to have a sweet taste on her tongue, even though she knows, objectively, that the words have no flavor. Her side throbs and she winces. \"Tend to my wounds,\" she amends. \"Then find Sophie.\" At this particular moment in time, waking in a cold sweat in a bed that's still unfamiliar even after three months, Sophie hates everything and everyone. Her parents took the whole \"we picked up a hitchhiking teenage freak with a creepy government woman after her\" thing pretty hard, dragging Sophie and Miles back to the UK and settling them down in what her mum calls a \"stable environment\" and Sophie calls dead boring. Being stuck in one place for more than a month is awful . Sophie doesn't understand how people can go about their dull lives with their dull routines and not die of fucking boredom. What really takes the cake, though, is that after the third or fourth time Sophie wakes up screaming from nightmares, her parents decide she's been traumatized and needs therapy. Sophie could have told them that therapy is even more traumatic than watching Hanna slit someone's throat, but no one listens to her. She finds herself subjected to a pair of idiotic therapists who want her to talk about her feelings. Sophie veers between two ways of driving both therapists up the wallâ€”being absolutely silent the entire session, or describing in slow, awful detail the way the knife had slid across that man's throat. One therapist actually looks like she's going to vomit, which Sophie counts as a win. Sophie doesn't bother telling them that the nightmares aren't about Hanna killing that man. The nightmares are about Hanna seeing her and hesitating, about the man turning the knife on Hanna instead while Sophie runs towards them, always too late to stop him. Some of the nightmares aren't even about Hanna and that man. Some are about Hanna standing in a vague, dark room that must be Grimm's house, with that creepy red-haired woman standing in the shadows, waiting for her to turn around. God, Sophie is never going to forgive Miles for telling that woman where Hanna went. Some nights Sophie wakes up and thinks about stealing some money out of her mum's purse and just going. She could get to Germany easily, she thinks, find Grimm's house, see if Hanna's there, and maybe even learn if that red-haired woman caught her. Most of those nights she doesn't get any further than halfway down the stairs before she realizes she's being stupid. If Hanna hasn't been caught by that woman, then she's probably on the run. She doesn't need Sophie getting in the way. Right now, though, she hates everything. She's just woken up from another nightmare where the red-haired woman had caught Hanna. Everyone else is asleepâ€”when she goes out into the hallway, the lights are off in her parents' bedroom and she can hear Miles snoring loud, snuffling sounds that means he's probably getting a cold. The house is always too small after one of her nightmares, the walls pressing in from all around. She needs to get outside, get some fresh air, or she's going to scream, and then her parents will hire a third useless therapist. She takes the stairs carefully, stepping over the loose board that always creaks and wakes her dad. She goes outside, breathes in the autumn air. Someone must have burned their leaves earlier; she can smell the smoke in the air. Sophie doesn't smoke, mostly because she hates the smell and how it gets into everything , but right now she wishes she had a cigarette. She wants to keep her hands busy, have something to do other than pace around her front yard at two in the morning like a crazy person. \"I am a crazy person,\" she says. She rolls her eyes. \"Great, now I'm talking to myself like an even crazier person. Brilliant.\" \"Is it considered a sign of mental instability to speak to yourself?\" a quiet, familiar voice asks from the shadows, sounding puzzled. Sophie doesn't shriek, but it's a very near thing. Her heart leaps into her throat and for a moment she can't breathe, too busy turning to stare wildly into the shadows of the tree. The moon's nearly full; when Hanna steps out into the moonlight, her pale hair and even paler face shine like a beacon. \"You,\" Sophie says when she gets her voice back. \"I thought you wereâ€” Miles told her where you were going, it wasn't me, I swearâ€” I thought she'd found youâ€”\" God, she's not going to do something as ridiculous as cry, she tells herself, but there are tears in her eyes anyway and her breath comes out as a sob. \"She did find me,\" Hanna says simply. \"What happened?\" Sophie asks though she's not certain she wants to know. \"She killed my father. I killed her.\" \"Oh.\" Sophie doesn't know what to say to that. It's not funny like the way Hanna had explained her mum's death and made Sophie's dad choke on his drink. Hanna spoke in the same quiet tone she did before, but now her frame's gone tense, her body curling in on itself like she's in pain. Sophie steps forward, wraps her arms around Hanna. Hanna's stiff in her arms for a second, still and unyielding like stone, and then she gives out a little sigh and lets her head drop to Sophie's shoulder. \"Just so you know, killing people is not what normal teenagers do,\" Sophie says, her lips brushing Hanna's hair. \"But it sounds like that woman deserved it.\" Hanna makes a soft sound, though whether it's agreement or just a murmur of acknowledgement that Sophie's talking, Sophie can't tell. \"You're not going to be going round killing anyone else, right?\" Sophie asks. Hanna's not here to kill them all in their beds, she knows, not when she remembers the pained look in Hanna's eyes when she'd turned from the man she'd killed and seen Sophie staring at her. \"No,\" Hanna says. \"I don't want to hurt anyone else. I told Marissa that, but she wouldn't listen.\" She's quiet for a moment, and then says, almost matter-of-factly, \"I have looked for you for some time. I didn't think you'd come back to Great Britain.\" \"Yeah, well, Mum and Dad got freaked and decided Miles and I needed to have some roots or some other nonsense.\" \"Roots?\" \"Yeah, you know, live in one place for a while and make some friends that you know for longer than two weeks. Well, maybe you don't know. You probably traveled all over the world with your dad.\" \"That sounds nice,\" Hanna says, still resting her head against Sophie's shoulder. \"And my father and I lived in the same cabin for my entire life until I met you.\" Hanna's practically leaning her entire frame against Sophie, nearly dead weight. Sophie wonders if Hanna's about to fall asleep, a suspicion which is confirmed in about two seconds by Hanna saying, \"I'm tired.\" Sophie huffs out an exasperated sigh. \"Then come in, idiot. I've got a bed and everything, which is probably better than whatever bed of leaves you slept in last night.\" Hanna raises her head at that, blinks her pale blue eyes at her in that befuddled way Sophie remembers so well. \"I didn't sleep on a bed of leaves. I slept on a park bench,\" she says. \"Oh yeah, because that's much better,\" Sophie scoffs. She takes Hanna's hand, gives it a tug. \"Come on, let's go to bed. Nobody should be awake at 2 in the morning.\" \"Okay,\" Hanna agrees. She follows along obediently, avoiding the same step that Sophie does. It isn't until they get into Sophie's room that she speaks again. \"Will your parents be upset with me?\" Sophie snorts. \"Who cares? Mum hated the red-haired woman, though, so you've got her sympathy. Just don't mention the whole killing people thing and we'll be set.\" She tugs Hanna onto the bed, unwilling to let go, even if it makes getting off her shoes a little awkward. \"Come on, take off your shoes and let's go to sleep. I'm tired and I need my beauty sleep.\" They crawl under the covers, lying face to face. Sophie can feel Hanna's breath on her lips. It's a weird feeling, but sort of nice, in a way that makes Sophie's stomach flutter. \"Being a lesbian wouldn't be too bad, if it was with you,\" she whispers, watches the way the moonlight catches on Hanna's lashes as Hanna blinks and shifts closer. \"So we are still friends?\" Hanna asks. \"Of course, dummy. Why wouldn't we be?\" \"You saw me kill someone,\" Hanna says flatly. \"You looked upset.\" \"Course I was upset, that was the first time I'd ever seen someone die, much lessâ€”\" Be murdered , Sophie's going to say, but then thinks better of it. \"â€”in front of me. It was a shock, that's all. We're still friends.\" Hanna's silent for a moment, and Sophie wishes she could read her expression. \"Good,\" Hanna says at last, and rests her hand on Sophie's hip. Her hand's warm, the heat of her skin soaking through the thin fabric of Sophie's pajama bottoms. Sophie leans forward, kisses her. It's a soft kiss, nothing like when she snogged that Spanish boy or the boy in Greece; this one's slow and sleepy. When they break off the kiss, they just stay close. Sophie finds herself slowing her breathing to mimic Hanna's until they're breathing in sync. \"I'm glad you came here,\" she confides. \"Everything was dead boring.\" \"I'm glad I came here too,\" Hanna says. She's silent for so long that Sophie's half-asleep when she speaks again. \"Tomorrow. Tomorrow I would like to listen to music.\" \"Sure,\" Sophie says sleepily, \"I've got loads of music.\" Hanna's smile is the last thing she sees before she falls asleep. ","Summary":" Look at me.

It kicks up the stray pale waves of her hair into her face, but she doesn't care or even seems to notice. The broken woman that now lies on her back looking up into her face with a mixture of terror, curiosity and awe. She clearly doesn't know how to react or much of anything else, but the end flickers in her cold eyes. No longer a threat, but somehow is able to strike a sliver of a cold and unknown emotion in her that she still is unable to name, like lightning rattling in her ribcage and seizing her heart - maybe this is the fear that father spoke of, she thinks to herself, the words echo within her mind,â€¦ the only father I was ever granted. These thoughts are soon pushed into the back of her mind to ruminate and find anchor in the garden of her mind for later preening. The cold steel pickles her hand and fingertips. She can feel her pulse beat and radiate down to her fingertips to mix with the chill of the metal pumping against it, her fingers carry their own pulse as she rights the pistol in her hand. She breathes in and out steady and sure, just like her father taught her. She looks down emotionless and blank faced as she saysâ€¦ \"I just missed your heartâ€¦\" She pulls the trigger BAANNGGG! It's over. She watches the life drain from her eyes and flesh as her life essence recedes in on itself, like a supernova only it does not create something unimaginably dangerous and beautiful, it merely ceases and stops, a means to an end, and Marissa Wiegler is over. The shot still rigs off the rusting metal and rotting wood, she cannot tell if it is actually still ringing or if her brain has not caught up with reality. She knows Marissa is dead, she does not even have to bend down to verify the kill, to press her fingers against the pale skin she knows is already growing cold. Never has a kill affected her this much, she has executed countless victims since the week or so before, and without effect, never stopping never relenting to the instinctive reaction to murder that is coded deep in the recesses of her DNA. But that reaction, that instinct is for the weak. Until now, she is forced to cope with this new emotion. Only this time she knows it does not have a name. It is one of those emotions, the one we have, as humans, always struggled to convey outwardly no matter how hard we try. The kind that humanity has left to drift aimlessly without a tile or a label, a description or a definition. The kind that floats out in a dark void of our subconscious destined to remain uncharted and unexplored by our delicate constitutions. As we are deathly afraid of the black voids of ourselves. The very meaning of our id, it will remain nameless wild and untamed, until we come to a point where we need that word to describe this unique drive or lack thereof. Perhaps that is its destiny not to be misconstrued and abused but to remain anonymous, only for us to ponder and then to ultimately accept without question. And that is just the ways she likes is, she doesn't have to explain herself anymore, she embodies the rogue, her ultimate is to be freeâ€¦ Her heightened senses quickly synapse the smell of death and metallic blood rising in the air, she knows it partially her own, which is another reason she needs to flee. Others are soon to follow. Her flight instinct activates and she deftly careens up the indentations of the rusting metal slide. Once she reaches the flat landing she strides confidently, without fear and with a touch of irony into the gaping jaws of the wolf's mouth. Although, she can't help but grasp her abdomen as the blood still flows, the pain is minimal but Marissa did meet her target. The slide opening seems to dementedly invite her in, the harmless fairy tale come to lifeâ€¦ come back to haunt her. Even with the stench of blood shrouding her body she takes the invitation and covers herself in the darkness that the cave offers. She is Hanna- and big bad wolves no longer scare her, but her future does. Fear what is fear, she wasn't programmed to feel fear. \"I'm not meant for that.\" she half whispers, as her words devoid of emotion, reverberate through the tunnel of the amusement park's wolf jaws, and flow out into the air to meet the void- just like the uncertainty ahead.

She thinks it's quite pretty. It's really the only gift she's ever been given. Sure, she's had birthdays, but this doesn't count, right? This was for no special event, so surely this mustn't count. She looks to her left. She'd found some change on the streets and managed to buy herself another bus token. A sign out her window says 'Now Entering Morocco'. Her eyes flutter closed as she thinks of all the places that Sophie might be. Her family travels the countryside, and she knows that there isn't a very good chance that Sophie's family would appreciate her coming back but, really, she has no where else to go. Her hand grasps the fabric of the grey jacket that Sophie lent her just where her heart is, and she wonders if anything special was done to it, too. Freak. Hanna jerks her head to her left and she sees two girls to her left, giggling, and she knows she shouldn't be so paranoid when no one is even talking to her but she doesn't care much for that word anymore. She doesn't realize she's staring until one of the girls shifts and whispers something to the other while looking back at her. She turns back forward and remembers to tell herself that they're not the enemies, she doesn't have any anymore. She tries to close her eyes but only images of Sophie and her father appear beneath her eyelids and she doesn't want to think of her father anymore, he isn't really hers to claim. So instead, she focuses on Sophie. She remembers the way her lips felt when she kissed her that night under her covers, and she remembers how much Sophie cared for her when she had no where to go, and how she followed her despite telling her not to. She remembers Sophie's brown hair and how it reminded her of her father's brown hair, and how gorgeous it looked on her. She thought about her tan skin compared to hers that was as pale as snow. She also remembers how it felt to see the hurt in her eyes when Sophie watched her kill someone, and then vowing that after Marissa, she wouldn't hurt anyone else because Hanna doesn't have anyone else and she needs someone to hold onto. Realization hits like an anchor to her chest and she tries to absorb the fact that Marissa may have killed her - she knows that Marissa must have tried to get information out of her. And if she knows Sophie, she knows that she wouldn't have said anything. But she doesn't want to believe that so she tries to get back to looking out her window, concentrating on the smallest things she sees, like the dark of the moon - and how it looked so much different in Finland. \"You getting off here?\" The bus driver twists in his seat to look back at her. \"Where are we?\" She asks him, looking out the window for signs that may tell her where she is. She's been on this onebus for a while now, but she's still not sure if she's where she wants to be. She has had to switch buses a few times. She looks back and she sees nothing but empty seats and wonders when the two girls left. \"A little out of Morocco. Can't take you much further, young lady. Out of my bus district.\" Hanna briefly wonders why he can't seem to speak in full sentences, but decides to let it go, she has no more enemies. They were not raised under the same circumstances. Perhaps he did not have proper teachers. \"Is it alright if I stay on for a little longer?\" He nods in response and turns back around, pulling out onto the street once more. / Hanna thinks she must have fallen asleep because when she opens her eyes again she is being shaken by the bus driver and she has a tight hold on his hand, but he only seems slightly alarmed. \"Time to get off, sweetie.\" As much as she hates that word, she stands up and as she gets to the last step of the bus, she turns around. \"I am sorry for grasping your hand. Thank you for taking me this far.\" She steps out of the bus and makes her way down the side of the street. She never thought that buses took you on main highways but she supposes that the bus driver must have taken her this far. She notices that she's nearing the end of the highway about after thirty minutes or so of transitioning between running and walking, trying to remember that she doesn't have to run anymore. The road turns to gravel and only a two-way street is there now. She pulls her I.D. out of her jacket pocket and wonders why she still has it, the reserved space for a picture empty. She slides it back in and decides to bother with it later. She comes to trailer park after trailer park, but none of them hold the face that she really wants to see. / By morning, she has looked through more than eight different trailer parks in various cities, but she can't find Sophie or her family anywhere. She begins to assume after the 6th park that they were all killed, but the promise of a new clearing keeps her looking. She's far out of Morocco, she knows. She finds herself in a smaller town, with a more countryside feel. These people speak Arabic as well. This isn't a trailer park, but a motel buisness, but an RV parked in the grass makes Hanna glance twice before sprinting into the area. What are the chances? Hanna doesn't even know the statistics of this even being possible, because it's so improbable, completely and totally insane, that she doesn't want to know. Short locks of brown hair catch her attention as they're loading into a vehicle. Hanna runs as fast as she can, she runs until she can feel her pulse beat in her legs, but she doesn't even make it to them before they pull out of the inn. She runs behind the vehicle, still as they pull onto the highway, and even with her inhuman strength she struggles to keep up. Horns blare behind her but she's not paying attention, all she cares about is finding Sophie and listening to her ramble obnoxiously but Hanna always thought that that was one of her best qualities, and she'd be better off dead if this was taken from her, too. Hanna reaches the side of the vehicle, and she swears her heart stopped when she saw her. She looked the same as she always did, but it was her. It was her. It was Sophie. She screams to the top of her lungs, and she knows that Sophie does the same when she catches a glance at her, running to the front of the vehicle and Hanna's sure telling her mother to pull over. When she does - pull over, that is - Hanna has to move out of the way at how abrubtly the huge van hauls to the side. \"Sophie, what are you-\" Hanna hears Rachel's voice trying to call out to Sophie, but she's already throwing the door open. Sophie stops a few feet in front of her and neither girls say anything for what seems like hours. \"Hanna?\" Sophie breathes. Hanna nods and doesn't understand when she sees Sophie release a few tears, but when she throws her arms around her she doesn't try to. \"I knew you'd come back.\" Sophie whispers in her ear, holding on to her as tight as she can as if she fears that she might go away again. But Hanna knows what it's like to be without her and she knows that if she has no place in this world, even if she's a freak, then she might at least have this.

Sophie was half out the door too when she heard her parents shout. She spun around to see a menacing youth waving a gun at them through the passenger window and shouting in German. The sight of the cold, gleaming metal of the barrel filled her with instinctive fear. The boy pushed away from the van with a final shout and sprinted after the others into the dockyard. Miles began to sob. Desperately Sophie looked between her family and the night. She was terrified of those men but she couldn't leave Hanna. Trying to stop fear from taking over she flung herself out the door and hit the asphalt. As she pounded away from them she could hear her parent's screaming out her name. Resolutely ignoring the tears that wanted to fall at the panic in their voices she sprinted as fast as she could in the direction Hannah had disappeared. The wet concrete caught the flickering lights of the dockyard. The result was an eerie yellow glow over everything. Somewhere nearby she could hear the low rumble of heavy machinery. Gasping for breath Sophie skidded to a halt in a corridor created by shipping containers. They loomed three stories high on either side, casting long shadows on the ground. As she regained her breath she could hear a faint whistling. Wildly she spun around, trying to guess the direction. The shelter of the containers hushed all the outside sounds. All Sophie could hear was the sound of her own heart pounding in her chest and the steady footsteps that accompanied the whistling. A thud to her left caught her attention. Something- someone- flashed passed at the end of a long corridor. It wasn't Hanna. The movement spurred Sophie into action and she took off in the opposite direction. She had guessed right- the whistling grew fainter. She wanted badly to call out to Hanna. She had no idea what she was doing here. She had no idea what she was going to do. It had been pure instinct, compassion, friendship which had driven her out the van and across the yards. Coming towards a wall of containers Sophie stopped. Timidly she approached the corner and peered around. It was empty. Glancing behind her and seeing that it was deserted she risked walking out into the wide road between containers. She began to edge forward, glancing around her. Suddenly there was an explosion of movement in front of her. She stopped dead. Three people whirled around each other, limbs connecting and bodies thudding against the hard metal walls. It was Hanna. In shock Sophie fixed on her friend's long blond hair as she spun and fought with the two youths. As she had one of them pinned up against the wall, her arms equally defending herself and cutting into the boy, she momentarily glanced over her shoulder. She looked right at Sophie and in the split second her eyes widened in shock and fear. \"Hanna?\" Sophie called weakly. The angry eyed, violent fiend before her wasn't the girl she had befriended...was she? One of the boys followed Hanna's gaze and spun around. Sophie knew she should turn and run but she couldn't move. She was equally terrified by and drawn to the events before her. The youth faced Sophie, a twisted grin spreading across his face as he took a step towards her. Suddenly Hanna was there, firmly placing herself between Sophie and the boy, her body tensed for action. They danced around each other, one darting forward and the other skipping away. Then, the first move was made and Sophie could only watch helplessly as they matched each other, strike for strike, blow for blow. Soon though, Hanna had the upper hand. She hurled the boy towards the metal wall. She glanced at Sophie again in the pause it took the boy to get back up. Sophie met her gaze with an expression of complete fear. Their communication was cut short as both girls were distracted by the glint of metal as it sliced through the air. The boy had produced a blade and launched himself at Hanna again. It was all so fast that Sophie couldn't quite work out what happened. Somehow Hanna deflected the blade as it was driven towards her and the next second she was behind the boy, two angry red streaks blooming across his chest. Without hesitation or mercy Hanna pulled him towards her and slid the blade swiftly across his throat. Viciously she pushed him against the wall and drove the blade once, twice, three times into his gut. As his blood spread over her hands she threw a pleading, desperate look at Sophie. A look that cried, 'please, you are the only friend I have ever had, please, understand...' But Sophie couldn't understand it all. She had thought Hanna was just a girl like her, a little strange sure but not...a killer. In a moment she would regret for the rest of her life she broke Hanna's gaze and turned, fleeing as fast as she could away from the girl. Unblinking, with blood dripping from her hands, Hanna watched her go. She had lost her only friend in the world.

No copyright infringement is intended. A/N : This is a fic for the movie \"Hanna\" starring Saoirse Ronan, Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana. I was inspired by the intrigue of Cate's character, the \"evil\" Marissa Wiegler. There's SO much more to her, in my mind, and exploring that uncharted territory is fascinating and quite fun. I wanted to delve into her background, since when I initially saw the movie I had the feeling that she and Erik might have been romantically involved when they were in Berlin and that Hanna was actually their child. I was wrong, but that's what fanfic is for, right? ;) It's rather undignified, she believes, the way her life is to unceremoniously end. In the middle of an abandoned roller coaster track in the middle of a dilapidated amusement park, bruised and bloodied, with a wild haired waif aiming her own gun at her. Marissa does not move. It would be inefficient to do so when she clearly knows what is to follow. She has never been anything but efficient in her life. She sees no reason to cower at the end of it. As she vaguely regards the girl whom she has waited for and pursued longer than she would like to admit, she is arrested by a familiar gleam in those cold blue eyes and just for a second, she can't breathe. It's not because there's an arrow lodged in her stomach. She keeps breathing despite it all, her body unwilling to give up the fight even though her mind tells her in clinically detached terms that it's over. There comes a point in one's career when right and wrong lose their distinctions, but it is often difficult to say exactly when that is. Marissa had never been one for introspection until she met him. She was a relic of the Cold Warâ€”of the days when young people fresh out of Ivy League schools were recruited by middle aged men to serve their country. She'd gone to Georgetown, graduated with degrees in international relations and German. The fact that she began working for the Agency less than a year after graduation spoke volumes of her caliber as an officer. She was stationed in East Berlin before the wall fell, and she learned hard lessons fast. Adapt or die, as they say. She had some scars to show for her days in communist Europe that she now keeps safely hidden beneath tailored Prada and Armani. She had been in the process of recruiting a man to spy for the United Statesâ€”a man who had just crossed over from east to west and she was asking him to return the place he fled to spy for them. By her fifteenth (or was it twentieth?) recruitment, she liked to think she had mastered the art of remaining inwardly detached while projecting a deceptive warmth. The truth was that people were drawn to the ice in her veinsâ€”she was an unyielding force in a shaky situation. His name was Erik. He spied for them because she made him believe that it was right, that it was the correct thing to do. He brought back information for her about the Russians' attempts to create \"super-soldiers\" and despite the preposterous name of the project, her superiors took it seriously. Living as she did in Berlin was not conducive to a social life. Perhaps she never really had one, as she studied hard in school almost to the point of self destruction. She treated her career with the same devotion although she couldn't afford to drive herself to quite the same extreme as she did then. Handling a 22 caliber Ruger whilst half asleep didn't do anyone any good, even if it was a mere lady's pistol. That's not to say she didn't work the social and diplomatic circuits. That was quintessential to the job in fact, and she was one of those women who were well aware of her presence yet seemed to be unaware of her ominous allure. Many an ambassador had turned their gaze her way and all she had to do was flick her eyes once in their direction, then turn away as if they were beneath her notice. A subtle shrug of an unclothed shoulder, a display of calculated vulnerability-irresistible to men in power. Each recruitment was a slow seduction, but at the end of the night they were offered an American passport and CIA protection instead of the obvious. Pathetic, and an easy way of covertly gathering what she needed to know. One night in Erik's hovel of an apartment about three blocks away from the lab that housed their great efforts changed everything. She might have blamed the shitty wine that she might have had too much of, but she remembered the way her hands trembled as she dropped her glass as well as the way neither of them cared about the freshly stained carpet. When she received the orders to terminate the project, she was momentarily blindsided with anger. They risked everything to get the scientists and materials to make this cockamamie idea work, and now when it was about the come to fruition they were pulling the plug. Her credibility as a recruiter would immediately suffer. She had no choice but to accept it; the fact that Langley's betrayal would mean she would lose face. For some, things like this ended careers. Half an hour later she has come to terms with it, is ready to cut and run as she'd been trained to do so long ago. Erik however, regards her with a cool gaze as she notifies him. His eyes are guarded and she is dismayed that she can no longer read him. He bids her good day and she is left standing alone in her office. When she receives the news that he is gone, that one of the patients and her child is gone as well, she sees red and is all too happy to take her orders this time. Langley wanted all vestiges of the experiment gone. She wants retribution badly, she wants nothing more than to be rid of the ache in her chest and she loads her gun in preparation. She welcomes the chilling detachment that had been her constant companion, but which had deserted her for some time since she met him. One, two, three, four shots ring into the dusky air. She throws herself to the ground, ears buzzing as the car speeds by. Jumping up, she sees it's crashed into a tree and she's running toward it. It's empty. A figure is sprinting in the distance and she knows in her heart that it's him, carrying the child to safety. She can't get to him but she runs anyway, the veil of red marring her vision never lifting until she's face to face with the woman responsible. She is standing over her, the washed-up singer they found in an abortion clinic and Marissa has never hated anyone more. \"You will never, ever have her.\" The other woman whispers triumphantly. Marissa looks at her, lying on the ground looking for all the world like a pitiful fallen doe, misty eyed and utterly innocent. Her hatred flares, filling her completely so that she takes extraordinarily savage pleasure in pulling the trigger and firing once, twice, thriceâ€¦ It is more than a decade before she sees Erik again, and in that time, she's never been able to forget the doe-eyed singer she shot dead in a meadow in the German countryside. He shoots the door and kicks it down, knowing that she is on the other side undoubtedly armed and dangerous as ever. He goes inside anyway. It is confidence and thoughts of his daughter that allow him to stride forward. She's standing in the middle of her shot up living room, staring at him with those wide blue eyes. He's struck by the rawness there, when in his memory they seemed to be carved from coldly glittering diamonds rather than betray any emotion so human as fear. She drops the gun and it clatters when it hits the wooden floor. He watches her and is suddenly reminded of the spilled wine, all those years ago. \"Marissa.\" He says simply. He too lowers his weapon, though he does not drop it. She looks strangely fragile. It is as if she is unconsciously seeking to destroy the previously immutable image of her that he has clung to and even relied upon all these years. She hasn't changed yet the woman before him now is completely foreign. \"You fucking bastard.\" With the ten feet between them, he still feels like he's been slapped. There is nothing to say. Tenderly he relearns the curves of her frail shoulders, her waistâ€”painfully thin now, her slender hips. He traces the faded scars on the alabaster skin of her lower back and she clutches him to her. He whispers to her in German, she responds with her lips and brutal teeth. This is not love; this is years of bitterness and forced isolation on both parts. They're back in his shithole apartment in Berlin and the gunshots that haunted him for more than a decade have relented, at least for the moment. He's never held her like this before. It is a novelty after the perfect storm that posited them in this situation; that he gets to trace lazy patterns along her side. He's still marveling at her mussed auburn hair, still short, still vibrant against her skin. His gaze is like a caress ghosting over the spots where he left marks upon her skin; just below her jaw upon her slender neck. How he once cherished the delicateness of her neck, her noble cheekbones...Then he knows she is watching him and disengages from her. Words are unnecessary and unwelcome. This changes nothing between them, the game is still afoot and he knows this. He only wonders how far she'll let him get before she resumes her deadly intent. She lets him leave at dawn. When she returns from brushing her teeth, the bed is made as if he was never there. She is not hurt. Because she knows that their time will come again, and she will not be so friendly in spite of the damned ache in her chest.

Raised in the forest, surrounded by snow and beasts and nothing, it was a pretty simple and effective code by which to live. Point being, it was the only way to live. Hanna had known one purpose throughout her life; kill Marissa Wiegler. This mission was outlined with the rule, Adapt or die, and it meant everything to Hanna. Success meant freedom, integrating into modern society, moving on with her life. Killing Marissa meant music. It meant electricity and television and electric tea kettles. It meant a new life, with her father, where they wouldn't have to hide in the wilderness and hunt deer. It meant that Hanna could learn through experience, and not from the cold, lifeless pages of books. It was feeling, where she had been genetically altered not to feel. It was people; their lives and how they were different, how they interacted with each other. Success meant Sophie, and as Hanna approached Marissa's prone form, she knew that victory was hers. \"I just missed your heart.\" The bullet was released, and it tore Marissa's life away, and all of Hanna's restraints, as well. As she turned away, intent on losing herself to the world and the CIA agents bound to follow her, Hanna knew she had spoken those last words not to Marissa, but to someone else entirely. Sophie sat in the holding tank, terrified, for herself, for her family, and even Hanna. But the image of Hanna murdering in cold blood chilled the English teen to the core. As freaky as Hanna was, Sophie had liked her. But no matter how perfect Hanna's aim was, Sophie knew the other girl would never pierce her heart. And, somewhere off the grid, laying low until she could better blend with society, Hanna felt a single tear escape one stunning blue eye. Arrows really weren't her strong point.

Marissa Wiegler was dead before the sounds of the gunshot had stopped reverberating through the equally dead theme park. Hanna let the gun slip from her bloodied grasp, ignoring the clatter as it hit the metal surface of the slide. Then, she walked. She went from metal to tracks to a long dirt path. She couldn't run, she didn't have the energy. She felt weak and getting weaker. Blood continued to leak out of her side and stain her clothes red. She heard the sirens get slowly louder. She stepped out onto the street. The sirens were deafening. She couldn't see much, her vision had blurred into a wave of blue and red. She heard someone shout something in German, something about the floor. She looked down, confused. \"What about the floor?\" she asked before she collapsed into darkness. 0o0 Joe Marsh stepped out of the Berlin Tegel Airport, dragging his cheap suitcase behind him. He was a short stocky man, his haggard face, thinning hair and ill fitting suit gave him the look of a man with the weight of the world resting on his shoulders. He grumbled into his phone \"Where are you? I don't see you.\" He glared up and down the street until his attention was finally caught by the man waving at him franticly. The man was younger than Joe, Clean shaven and well dressed. Joe stomped down to other CIA agent, pushing his way through the crowd. \"David?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Take me to the hospital then.\" About an hour later Joe and David were observing the girl lying in a hospital bed. 'She's very pretty' thought Joe to himself. She wasn't exactly a supermodel. But she was still beautiful, almost like something from a fairy tale, like an elven maiden or a fairy princess. He could see why the nurses had taken to calling her ''sleeping beauty''. \"Are we sure it was Marissa that shot her?\" Asked Joe. \"Ballistics confirms it was Marissa's gun that fired the bullets that killed Heller and shot the girl.\" \"They got ballistics overnight?\" Asked Joe incredulously. \"This is Germany Joe.\" Chuckled David \"And I suppose it helps they're really pissed about all this. Anyway, We know Marissa shot Eric because she did it in broad fucking day light and she was seen doing it by about 20 people. We think she shot the girl. The German government aren't going to arrest the girl for killing Marissa. The evidence is circumstantial, any case would get hacked to pieces in court.\" Joe facepalmed \"This whole thing is just a huge fucking mess.\" He looked again at the girl. If the doctors were right she would make a full recovery, She was either very lucky, or hard as nails. \"So why are we here?\" David winced \"This is where things get really fucked up.\" \"4 people are dead!\" Exclaimed Joe. David continued as if Joe had never spoken \"This girl doesn't exist.\" \"What?\" Asked Joe in confusion and annoyance. \"She wasn't found with any Id, and so far no records appear on any German database. No photos, No dental records. Nada.\" \"Can you please get to the part where any of this is our problem.\" Growled Joe. \"It's a bit complicated. You see, When the ballistics team ran the tests on Marissa's gun they realised it matched another round used in another murder. One Katrin Zadek, the mother of a woman supposedly killed by Erik Heller in the 90's, Johanna Zadek. One hunch and an overnight DNA comparison service later and we know know that this girl is Katrin Zadek's descendant. And given that Katrin only had one daughter, We can presume that this is Johanna Zadek's daughter.\" \"And?\" Asked Joe. \"Well when Johanna disappeared...\" \"Disappeared?\" \"Yeah. Well when she did the German police had a number of leads, one of which was Johanna's then boyfriend, William Walker.\" Joe blanched \"Would this be the same William Walker that is running for congress.\" David nodded, Joe's face fell into a mask of disbelief \"As in William ''I'm a family man and have been happily married for 20 years'' Walker?\" David nodded again \"It's gets worse.\" \"How?\" Asked Joe bluntly. \"If Walker is this girls father, he would be her only living relative and as such required by law to care for her.\" \"Shit.\" Muttered Joe. He gazed at the girl through the glass window of her room. She looked so peaceful, Her soft breathing almost in time with the beep of the machine monitoring her vitals. \"Although even if she's not Walkers daughter the Germans want shot of her. So far as they can tell she's not technically a German citizen and have ordered her extradition.\" \"But we don't even know where she's a citizen of yet!\" \"Unless she turns out to be Walkers daughter, At which point she becomes an American citizen.\" \"Oh come on! They're just making this up as they go along now.\" \"Well at this point they kind of have to Joe. This has never happened before.\" Joe sighed \"And what if she isn't Walkers daughter.\" David chuckled grimly \"Then she is a German citizen after all and becomes a ward of their state. Once we've taken her back to Germany.\" Joe nodded \"Right so... Wait what do you mean ''back to Germany''.\" \"They want us to take her as soon as she's discharged.\" Explained David. \"Why are we doing all this for the German authorities?\" Asked Joe. \"So they don't tell the press or anyone else that the whole thing was a CIA operation that screwed the pooch so hard the pooch is on Gerry Springer with the resulting child.\" Answered David \"You've got a way with words David.\" \"Thank you sir.\" \"Which means you can tell the girl about her situation when she wakes up.\" \"What about you sir?\" Asked David. \"I've got to go back to America, and tell a newly elected congressman that he may have a daughter he never new about.\" \"And his wife.\" Added David. \"And his wife.\" Confirmed Joe. 0o0 Hanna's eyes opened slowly. She was in a large white bed in a small, blurry white room. The only sound was a soft beeping coming from her left and her own breathing. Slowly her vision cleared to reveal power blue walls illuminated by a harsh halogen light. She looked to her left. The beeping was coming from a monitor that displayed a dizzying range of information. Her eye was caught by a bag of fluid hanging from a metal stand. Her eyes followed the clear tube attached to the bag till it reached her arm. She could feel the catheter under her skin. It took her no time at all to decide she didn't like the feeling at all. Her other arm moved sluggishly, weakly as her fingers slowly found their way to the tube in her arm. \"I wouldn't pull that out if I were you.\" Said a voice. Hanna looked up into a kindly, middle aged man's face. His dark hair was cropped short and a little messy. \"Hello.\" He continued \"My name is David Miles, I work for the CIA.\" Hanna visibly tensed, David immediately put out his hands to reassure her \"Don't worry, I'm not here to arrest you. I'm here to help.\" Hanna regarded him for a moment. She didn't know anything about him beyond his name and his place of work, but she knew in her gut she could trust him. \"Where am I?\" She asked finally. \"You're safe. You're in a hospital in Berlin. What's your name?\" Hanna was unsure for a moment, she thought for a moment she should give the cover story her father, no not her father, Eric had given her. But, she couldn't, she was tired of running and lying. \"Hanna.\" She said finally. \"Hello Hanna. It's my job to tell you about what's happening. First; You are not in any trouble, Neither we or the German government have any plans to arrest you. Understand?\" \"I think so.\" She Answered. David smiled \"Good. Now Hanna I'm going to ask you a few questions, you do not have to answer but it would make my job of looking after you a lot easier of you did.\" \"Ok.\" \"Where have you been living?\" \"Iceland, with my fath-Eric Heller.\" \"Father?\" \"He said he was my father.\" Hanna's voice cracked. She felt the pressure of tears behind her eyes. But she refused to let them loose. \"Ok.\" David had pulled out a notepad and was scribbling down everything Hanna had said. \"Why did you kill Marissa Wielger?\" \"I didn't want to.\" Sobbed Hanna quietly \"But she was trying to kill me.\" David raised an eyebrow \"Do you know why?\" \"No. Eric said that she killed my mother but didn't say why.\" \"Right. Do you know where you were born?\" \"A town in Poland called Galinka.\" \"Ok. That should be enough for now. Now this could be a bit confusing but we're going to have to take you to America as soon as you're feeling better.\" \"Why?\" Asked Hanna, Her confusion evident on her face. \"I can't tell you right now. But as soon as I can I will.\" Promised David, Hanna believed him. David stood up to leave, He gave her one last reassuring smile before he turned to open the door. \"David.\" Said Hanna tentatively. He turned back to her \"Does this mean we're friends?\" \"Yeah, Sure.\" He said. Hanna gave a small smile. And David could have sworn the room got a little bit brighter. 0o0 Joe scowled as he dragged the heavy case from the boot of his car. He was jet-lagged, tired and hungry. And now he had to potentially ruin a family. He was not having a good 24 hours. He looked at his watch. Christ was that really the time, it felt like it should be the middle of the night on Monday, not mid-morning Saturday. He stomped up to the house. Ignoring the well tended garden and the two small children playing with a large Doberman. He didn't ignore the young man on the veranda with his girlfriend. Mainly because he looked a couple of years older than the girl in Germany. This could get very awkward. \"Hey.\" Said the young man, Confused. Joe realised he had been staring slightly. \"Hello. Is William Walker in today?\" Asked Joe tiredly. \"I'm William Walker.\" Said the young man warily. Joe raised an eyebrow \"William Walker Senior.\" He clarified. \"Who's asking?\" Challenged the boy, Standing up. He was well built and handsome. The football jersey from a local high school marked him as probably being a jock. \"Someone who doesn't have time for this.\" Growled Joe, pulling out his badge. The boy visibly paled at the CIA Id. \"Daaaaad!\" He called loudly. A tall man rounded the corner of the house. He was almost an exact copy of the younger William Walker, only aged to a sort of rugged perfection. His khakis and blue shirt were stained with engine oil. He smiled at Joe as he wiped oil from his hands with a rag. He introduced himself with a large smile \"William Walker.\" He thrust out his hand which Joe took lightly, Not wanting to stain his hands with grease. \"Joe Marsh.\" He flashed his badge again which Mr Walker seemed to take in stride. \"I'm here to ask you a few questions could we please go inside. \"Of course.\" He opened the door for Joe and they stepped inside. 0 \"Nicole! We have a guest!\" Shouted Mr Walker. He was answered by a woman's voice asking \"Are they staying for lunch?\" \"Of course.\" Answered Walker. \"Oh no I couldn't.\" Said Joe instantly. \"Oh don't worry about. Besides you look famished.\" Laughed Walker. And Joe realised he hadn't had a proper meal since before he had left for Germany, over 24 hours ago. It had been coffee and airline snacks ever since. He looked around the dining room. It was dominated by a long oak table, polished to a mirror shine and laden with food. He looked around to see that 4 children had gathered around the table in various seats. Two boys, One of which was William Walker Jr. The other Joe didn't know the name of. He looked to be about 8 years old. And two girls, one was Williams Jr girlfriend the other (about 15 years old) bore a striking resemblance to her mother who had also joined the assemblage. Nicole Walker looked like she had stepped straight out of Stepford Wives. Except her clothes which were on the cutting edge of fashion. The whole family looked at him expectantly. \"I shouldn't. But I am starving.\" Relented Joe. \"But first I need to take some blood.\" Walker stopped in his tracks \"What? Why?\" He asked as Joe put the case down on a nearby chair. Joe opened the case and pulled out a pair of medical gloves which he quickly slipped on. \"Whoah!\" Said Walker \"I'm not giving you anything until tell me what's going on.\" Joe looked around at the confused/outraged faces of Walkers family. \"You really don't want to know that yet.\" He sighed. \"Well I hope you have some kind of warrant for this.\" Rumbled Walker. As if on cue Joe pulled a white envelope from the case and passed it to Walker. Walker ripped open the letter and skimmed over it's contents. Joe could almost see his eyes stop at the words ''comparative DNA test''. \"Fine.\" Mumbled Walker as he thrust out his hand. Joe tried to be gentle as he could as he took a thimble full of Walkers blood. He handed the visibly angry man a small plaster as he inserted the sample into the machine. \"We should get the results in a few minutes.\" Explained Joe. \"Well you might as well eat something.\" Said the confused Mrs Walker. Joe nodded his thanks as he took a plate of chilli. The next few minutes were almost painfully tense as the machine in the case whirred and buzzed. Joe seemed to be the only person eating as he hoovered up his plate of food. The rest of the family exchanged puzzled looks while Walker himself simply stared at his plate of cooling food. A short while later the machine gave a series of short bongs that signified the completion of it's analysis. Joe stood and inspected the short print out that showed the results. He sighed heavily before sitting back down and giving Walker a pointed look. \"William what is it?\" Asked Nicole. Walker almost whispered \"Kids I need you to got to your rooms.\" \"Dad what's goin-\" Began the younger Walker. \"NOW!\" Boomed Walker. \"I should take Jenny home.\" Whispered the lad as he and his girlfriend stood up. \"William. What is going on?\" Demanded Nicole as the children slowly crept from the room. Joe pulled a notepad and pen from his pocket and looked up at Walker, Who glared down at him. \"Mr Walker.\" Began Joe. Prompting Nicole to circle round the table so they were both opposite Joe. \"I would like to point out at this stage you are not under any suspicion. You are firmly in the clear for every crime connected with this case that we know about .\" Joe emphasised the last part dangerously. Both the Walkers tensed. \"But the fact is you could not possibly have committed any crime that could possibly have something to do with this case.\" \"What is going on.\" Growled Walker. Joe sighed deeply \"Mr Walker what exactly was your relationship to Johanna Zadek.\" Nicole spoke first \"Oh that trollop.\" She scoffed angrily \"She was just his P.A. When he was in Germany. And those idiots in the German police were convinced he had something to do with her running away from home.\" \"Mr Walker.\" Probed Joe. \"It was just a fling.\" He whispered. Nicole went white. \"William?\" She asked quietly \"What does she want?\" Asked William quietly. \"Ms Zadek has been dead for 14 years. But that fact is more or less unconnected with the matter at hand.\" Joe paused and looked Walker in the eye. \" Mr Walker, are you aware that at the time of her disappearance Ms Zadek was 1 month pregnant.\" Mr Walker shook his head dumbly \"Well she was. And she did carry the child to full term. That child is currently lying in a Berlin hospital bed. And the test I just performed has confirmed with a high level of probability. That you are her father.\" Nicole Walker shot up out of her chair and ran from the room to the kitchen. The sound of retching soon followed. Mr Walker looked unsure as to whether he should go after her or stay in the same room as the stony faced agent. The sounds of his wife being violently sick pulled him into action. He sped to the other room. Soon after the muffled sound of angry screaming emanated from the other room, soon followed by a dejected Mr Walker. Joe heard the beep of his phone informing him that he had received a text. He took a moment to read the text and give Walker a moment to collect himself. \"Why are you telling me all this?\" Asked Walker angrily \"What made you come here and ruin my life like this?\" \"Because as soon as a small amount of paperwork is done you will be her legal guardian.\" \"WHAT!\" Thundered Walker \"Why me?\" \"Because you will be her only living relative\" \"I won't take her in.\" Insisted Walker. \"The law says you will.\" Said Joe dangerously. \"She will be here in a few days.\" Joe stood up to leave. He packed up his notepad and testing apparatus and left the shocked Walker with his troubles. 0 Walker stepped into the kitchen where his wife was nursing a freshly poured glass of wine. She looked at him from her seat next to the breakfast bar. She didn't even try to conceal the malice in her eyes. He grabbed a beer from the fridge before sitting down opposite her. For a few moments they were both silent. The deathly silence was broken by Nicole. \"How could you?\" She hissed in confusion and anger. \"I. I... I'm sorry.\" \"SORRY FOR WHAT?! THE ''FLING'' OR THE CHILD YOU HAD WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?!\" Screamed Nicole, jumping out of her chair. \"I didn't know about the girl!\" Pleaded Walker. \"Because that makes it so much better!\" She shrieked. \"It happened years ago Nicole! It was just a stupid mistake!\" \"I don't care! You've ruined everything!\" Nicole slumped back down into her seat. \"It's not just my fault you know.\" He whispered angrily. \"The way you were acting when I left the country I didn't think I would have a marriage to come home to.\" Nicole looked up at Walker through tear stained eyes. \"Either way,\" He continued \"We're not getting a divorce...\" \"I don't care about your stupid political career.\" Spat Nicole. \"That's not why.\" Whispered Walker softly. He slowly took Nicole's hand into his own. \"I still love you Nicole, Even if you don't want me to any more.\" At that moment the front door of the house opened quietly and shut slowly. William Jr. poked his head round the corner, his face a mask of concern and fear. \"Are you guys alright?\" He asked nervously. \"Yeah we're fine.\" Answered Nicole quickly as she gripped Walkers hand a little tighter. 0o0 Hanna sat up in her bed. She had spent the last 2 days lying in a hospital bed, a little weak but no worse for ware. And she was bored to tears. She had never spent such a long time completely inactive. Usually she was hunting or training, or helping her fath- Eric, make repairs to the hut. The closest thing she'd had to activity was telling David her story, about her life in Finland by the lake. And then about why she had travelled to Germany. And why she had wanted to kill Marissa. Hanna had asked David about Sophie, if he knew what had happened to her. He said he would look into it but had made no promises. He didn't seem hopeful. He had tried to put on a brave face, but once Hanna had explained to him the rules of being friends (namely; No lying), he had told her the truth. In all probability either Marissa or Issacs had killed them. She had cried that night. The soft swish of the door heralded the beginning of what had swiftly become the highlight of Hanna's day. David's daily visit. \"Hello Hanna.\" He greeted with a smile. \"Hello.\" She smiled back. He pulled up a chair to the side of Hanna's bed and gave a her a small smile. \"The doctors tell me you should be well enough to leave the hospital.\" Hanna grinned from ear to ear \"When?\" She asked excitedly. \"Today.\" Smirked David. \"So we're going to America today?\" Asked Hanna. \"Yes.\" Sighed David \"Which means I've got to tell you about where you will be living.\" David paused and looked directly at Hanna. Who met his gaze with her own questioning look. \"There's no way to soften this so I'll just say it. Hanna, we found your biological father.\" Hanna's face went black, her eyes wide from shock. After a few moments if silence she finally spoke \"Who is it?\" \"He's a US citizen named William Walker. He's currently running for Congress.\" Hanna spoke to herself softly \"The national legislative body of the US, consisting of the Senate, or upper house, and the House of Representatives, or lower house, as a continuous institution.\" She listed quickly. David whistled, impressed \"Even I didn't know all that.\" Hanna looked at him questioningly \"I thought the House of Representatives and Congress were different things.\" He revealed sheepishly. \"Anyway, yes. William Walker. And slightly more importantly, I couldn't find your birth certificate in any records so far.\" David paused for a moment \"Which means you have actually fallen into a weird, sort of, hole, in international law.\" \"Hole?\" Asked Hanna. \"Technically you don't exist.\" He revealed with a laugh. Hanna frowned, not really understanding. She was fairly certain she did, in fact, exist. David gave a small laugh \"Don't worry about it.\" He paused as a nurse entered the room and began to detach Hanna from various medical devices. \"Come on.\" He said finally \"Let's get you home.\" Hanna suspected he didn't mean Finland. Please Review[Chapter 2] Hanna VS Real Life Hanna VS Documentation Shopping: The activity of buying things from shops Hanna watched fascinated as the carousel moved slowly round. Bag after bag moved past her. Occasionally someone would step past her, pick one or two up and lug them off towards the exit. She looked out for David's bag. She didn't have one of her own. She was wearing her only possessions in the world. A thin jacket, a thinner shirt, jeans and trainers. The same clothes she had been given by Sophie what felt like a small lifetime ago. The only visible difference was that they were slightly cleaner. \"Where the hell is it?\" He mumbled. Probably think she couldn't hear. \"There!\" She said excitedly as it tumbled down the chute. She skipped forward and lifted the bag easily from the conveyor belt. \"Thanks.\" Said David with a smile as he hefted it from her grasp. He looked down at the bag and back at Hanna. \"What now?\" She asked expectantly. 0 David led Hanna out of the Airport towards a black car parked in a VIP spot, The CIA logo emblazoned on it's side. Getting Hanna to the car was rather difficult as she kept walking into things and people. Her attention had been thoroughly grabbed by the huge glass and concrete structure that was Washington international airport. As they slowly approached the car a tall dark woman climbed out of the driver side. Her long black hair held back tightly, not a single hair was out of place. A stark contrast to Hanna who's shock of blonde hair only added to her skins ghostly paleness. \"Agent Miles.\" She greeted with a smile. \"Agent Hollis.\" He greeted back with a tired sigh. \"That bad huh?\" \"I swear to god the guy next to me smelt like a used diaper.\" Muttered David \"At least she slept well.\" He pointed a thumb towards Hanna who had since become fascinated by a parking meter. \"So that's the talk of the office.\" She stated more than asked. \"She really killed Wiegler?\" \"Yep.\" Answered David \"With a bullet from her own gun no less.\" \"I met Marissa once. She was a scary woman.\" She looked at Hanna closely \"She looks like an odd one.\" \"Hanna!\" Called David. The young girl scampered over and looked up at Agent Hollis. \"This is Agent Sarah Hollis.\" Introduced David \"Sarah, this is Hanna... We haven't come up with a surname yet.\" \"What do you want to be called?\" Asked Sarah. Hanna's eyes danced for a moment as she thought deeply. \"I don't know.\" She answered finally. \"Well. We'll get to that.\" Said David with a smile. 0 Sarah watched as Hanna became increasingly fascinated by the sights rushing past the car as it travelled through Washington. David was sat next to Hanna observing her closely. \"The city stifled her.\" Muttered Hanna, almost to quiet to hear. \"Stifled who?\" Asked Sarah. \"Rachel.\" Breathed Hanna \"Emotionally, creatively, spiritually.\" Sarah and David shared a glance via the rear view mirror. \"Rachel was Sophie's mother, wasn't she?\" Asked David quietly. Hanna just nodded. David cleared his throat before speaking again \"Hanna. I'm afraid you have a somewhat busy day ahead of you. We're going to a State Department office to get you a passport, a social security card and a certificate of US citizenship.\" \"I'm a US citizen?\" Asked Hanna quietly. \"Technically yes. Your mother was German but your father is American. As your only living relative you'll be living with him so we thought it was best to make you an American citizen.\" \"With my father?\" Asked Hanna. \"Who is he?\" \"We'll get to that.\" Said Sophie \"But first we have to get your documentation. Then we're going to the shops to get you some clothes.\" Sophie smiled at Hanna before turning into a large car park. 0 Hanna looked down at her passport and a memory flashed. A man with straggly hair, wild eyes and a large paper flower. In a thin room, in a fairy-tale house. \" Not you. Not you, my dear, but everyone else. We need paper and computers so we don't have to ask people their names or look them in the face. You have a good face. You look just like your father. And you walk like him, too.\" Hanna wondered if she did look like her father. Or if she looked like Eric Heller. She looked down at her name. Hanna Zadek. David had asked her what she wanted to be called. When she said 'Zadek' he had looked surprised. \" Why not take your father's name?\" He had asked. \" I want to be like my mother.\" She had answered. Sarah looked over Hanna's shoulder. \"Not a very nice photo.\" she said matter-of-factly \"But then again they never are.\" She sighed \"Mine makes me look like a fish.\" She giggled. Hanna looked at her owlishly. Sarah looked away sheepishly \"But now we get to go shopping.\" \"Women and shopping aye.\" Cut in David. He walked up the corridor holding a big brown envelope which he passed to Sarah \"Here's the rest of her documents. Where are you taking her shopping then?\" He asked. \"Target. I've only got a budget of a hundred dollars.\" Sighed Sarah. \"What's Target?\" Asked Hanna, handing her passport to Sarah. \"A shop that sells everything.\" Answered David. He turned to Sarah \"I'm off, I've got to debrief with Joe.\" \"Your leaving?\" Hanna said, with a note of confusion. David smiled warmly at her \"I'll see you again tomorrow, before you meet your father and his family. Well I suppose they'll be your family soon.\" \"I'm not meeting him today?\" \"It'll be a bit late in the day to meet him once we've been shopping. He lives almost an hour away by car.\" Supplied Sarah. \"We'll be spending tonight at a motel and tomorrow me and David will drive you down to Fountain. It's the town where you'll live.\" \"I think you'll like it.\" Says David, tying to cheer Hanna up. But she doesn't smile, she only looks back down to her passport photo. \"Anyway, I've gotta go. See you tomorrow Hanna.\" David gives her a small smile before turning around and walking off to call a taxi. Sarah tentatively threads an arm around Hanna's shoulders \"Don't look so glum Hanna.\" She says quietly \"We get to go shopping. Even if it is Target.\" 0o0 \"Hey Joe.\" Greeted David with a smile. The bedraggled and visibly tired agent waved back absent mindedly. David chuckled quietly at the older agent as he gave his computer an angry growl. \"The computer fighting back?\" He asked, suppressing a laugh. \"Are you sure she said she was from Galinka?\" Asks Joe while continuing to frown at his computer. \"Positive. Why?\" Asked David. \"Because this place doesn't seem to exist.\" David pulled a chair from another desk and sat beside Joe at his computer \"Are you sure?\" \"I'm sure.\" Said David, annoyed \"I tried the CIA database, I tried the FBI database, I even tried Google. All I got was some Russian model. Did you know that galinka is old Greek for 'calm'? Because that's all I found out!\" \"Did you try the old paper files?\" Asked David thoughtfully. Joe gave David a cool look. \"I'm not going rooting through almost sixty years of boxes in a dusty warehouse for some sixteen year old girl.\" \"Her name's Hanna.\" Commented David with an infuriating smile \"And I'll go look for it. You're obviously busy doing... whatever it is you've been doing.\" Joe's cool look turned to a look of annoyance. \"I've been co-ordinating with the Child Protection Service to get William Walkers home checked for suitability. Without letting anyone who might alert the press know why.\" Joe buried his head in his hands \"It's been a fucking nightmare!\" David gave Joe a pat on the back \"It'll get easier. She'll be out of our hands soon.\" David stood up to leave \"I'll go see what I can find in storage.\" 0o0 William Walker sighed as the shockingly fat woman wobbled up his stairs. The oak floor creaked as she stepped across the landing towards his old study. He was not happy that his files, computer, hunting trophies and liquor cabinet were now scattered around the house until he could find a new place for them. Except the liquor itself which was hidden on the top shelf in the kitchen. The fat woman, apparently named 'Janice', finally waddled over to his old study. \"So this is where she'll be sleeping?\" Asked Janice. Looking around the room from the doorway. It contained a reasonably sized bed, a chest of draws and a bedside table. They were a mix of primary colours and clashed horribly with each other and the dark pine wood panelling ' which I won't even be able to enjoy now ' thought Walker to himself. \"It seems nice. You've clearly spent a lot so far.\" Walker put on his polite public voice \"Well yes- wait? What do you mean so far?\" Janice turned and spoke in an annoyingly calm voice. \"Well she'll require a school education, possibly some new clothes and a similar level of disposable income to her new siblings.\" Walker almost exploded in rage ' I don't even want her here! Why should she get the same as my real kids! ' But he didn't. She was a voter, and possibly a whistle-blower to the press. So instead he said \"Of course, we wouldn't want her to think she was unwanted.\" In his 'press conference' voice. Janice smiled, convinced. \"Of course we will be making regular visits.\" She said as she hobbled past Walker to the stairs. Walker gritted his teeth as she began to descend them even more slowly than she had ascended them. \"Hello Mrs Walker.\" she called to the woman at the bottom of the steps. Mrs Walker stared not so much daggers as broadswords as the CPS woman and Walker. Nicole Walker took a small sip from her wine and replied \"Nicole, please.\" icily. Janice gave a small huff as she reached the bottom of the stairs \"It's nice to see you again Mrs Walker.\" She said, oblivious to Nicole's cold demeanour. \"So Janice.\" Began Walker as he ushered her towards the door \"the CPS will be discrete about all this won't it?\" He asked worriedly \"It's just with my career...\" He heard Nicole give a short mocking laugh from behind him and he once again gritted his teeth in annoyance. \"Don't worry Mr Walker. You can rely on me to keep this a secret.\" She tapped her nose consiprationally \"Anyway, I'm no one to judge. The stuff I get up to when my husband is away.\" She laughs as Walker suppresses a grimace \"It would curl your hair. Anyway I must be off.\" Walker opens the door as quickly as he can and Janice squeezes herself through the doorway. Walker smiles and waves as she trots down the garden path. Past Jenny and Simon Walker as they play with Frank the Doberman. \"So now we tell the kids.\" Calls Nicole from the dining room. Walker slams the door shut and follows the sound of wine being poured into a glass. \"How many bottles is that?\" He asks acidly. \"Only my second glass today.\" Replies Nicole calmly. \"But now we have to tell the kids.\" She reminds him \"No, wait. You have to.\" She looks at Walker with a vicious smile as she takes a sip from her glass. \"We'll both do it.\" He says. \"HA! Like that's ever gonna happen!\" Laughs Nicole \"This is your mess, you can deal with it. What's it you say in your campaign messages.\" She begins to imitate his gruff voice \" Like I tell my kids. You've got to own your decisions. \" She laughs \" And when I'm in congress you'll see. My office will make sure you know what's happening. That rich. Makes me laugh every time now.\" Walker sighed as Nicole walked past him to the living room. He knew she was right. He'd have to tell the kids tonight. 0o0 Sarah smiled as she and Hanna stepped out into the sun of the parking lot. \"You know you are really easy to shop for.\" She comments to Hanna who was inspecting one of her bags contents. Mostly they contained plain t-shirts and denim jeans. \"We've still got some money left. You know what, I'll take you down to American Apparel. See of we can't get you a set of clothes for occasions.\" \"What would be the difference?\" Asked Hanna, confused. Sarah shrugged her shoulders \"They'll be nicer. And better made.\" Hanna thought back to something someone had told her; \" The better made something is, the longer it lasts and the more use you get out of it before you need a new one.\" Eric had told her that. Sarah saw Hanna's face fall somewhat so she added \"Come on. You might learn to enjoy shopping if you do it at a good shop.\" Hanna smiled up at her shyly \"Ok then.\" 0o0 A brown A4 envelope smacked into Joe's desk. \"This was surprisingly easy to find.\" Said David with triumph. Joe grabbed the envelope \"What is it?\" He asked. \"The only CIA file that has the keyword 'galinka' attached to it.\" He answered \"It's just a list of names.\" Joe opened up the envelope to find a single sheet of paper. The words 'project galinka' was printed in black across the top. And underneath was a list of names including Marissa Wiegler, Eric Heller and a few others. Mostly they were German sounding names, all prefixed with 'Dr'. But a couple were more English. \"I've checked most of the names already.\" Commented Joe \"Researchers in genetics, most of them would have been Nobel Prize winners if it weren't for the fact they were Nazis.\" \"Nazis?\" David sat down opposite Joe \"Smuggled out of Germany after World War Two for Operation Paper-clip.\" Joe looked at the paper in front of him. \"What does this have to do with Hanna?\" He asked himself, out loud. \"I'm willing to bet that Dr Somers can tell us.\" Answered David. Joe looked at him questioningly \"He's the only guy on the list who's till alive. But not by much, he's almost a hundred.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Florida, a retirement home in Jacksonville.\" Says David. Joe stood up suddenly \"Well then we'd better get moving before he dies on us.\" 0o0 \"This is nice.\" Said Sarah as she showed Hanna a long white dress \"What do you think?\" Hanna inspected it, not really knowing what she was looking for. \"It's white.\" She said finally. Sarah sighed theatrically \"Yes I know it's white. Would you like to wear it?\" \"Why?\" Asked Hanna. Sarah opened her mouth to give an answer but didn't say anything. She waited and thought for a moment before speaking \"Well nicer clothes feel nicer to wear. And you look nicer. Which makes you- well it makes me feel nicer.\" Hanna nodded with vague understanding \"Would you like to try it on?\" Asked Sarah. Hanna nodded again and took the dress from Sarah. \"Where?\" She asked. Sarah looked around for a changing room and spotted a teenage girl wearing a name-badge. \"Excuse me!\" She called. The girl turned and spotted Hanna inspecting the dress in her hands. She almost hopped over to the two of them. She gave Sarah a big smile \"Hey there I'm Kate.\" Hanna looked up from the dress straight into Kate's eyes. Dark hazel framed by Kate's fiery red hair. Hanna blushed slightly before greeting Kate quietly \"Hello. I'm Hanna.\" Kate blushed back and averted her gaze from Hanna's ice blue eyes. Sarah took all this in with a small smile. \"She'd like to try this on please.\" She said, stifling a giggle. Kate and Hanna snapped out of whatever had taken a hold of them. \"This way to the changing rooms.\" Said Kate, embarrassed. She led them through the shop to a bank of curtained off changing rooms. Hanna disappeared inside with the dress leaving Kate and Sarah alone outside. After a brief moment Kate coughed nervously. \"So are you Hanna's friend or...?\" \"A family friend.\" She told her. Kate rocked on her heels for a moment before speaking again \"She's got a nice accent. Where's she from?\" Sarah sat down on a nearby stool. \"Why don't you ask her.\" She answered. The cubicle's curtain slid open to reveal Hanna in a long white dress. Her straggly hair cascaded down around her shoulders. The only thing that looked out of place on the young woman was the pair of filthy white trainers she was wearing. \"That looks good on you.\" Commented Sarah with enthusiasm. Hanna looked down at herself and frowned. \"Really?\" She asked \"How can you tell?\" \"You can just tell. And you look very pretty.\" Hanna continued to look unconvinced. Sarah nudged Kate in the elbow, gave her a pointed look and nodded in Hanna's direction, who was inspecting herself in a mirror. \"You do look very nice.\" She said somewhat timidly. Hanna turned to Kate with a smile \"If you really think so.\" Kate nodded furiously before turning to Sarah, who had a slightly triumphant look about her. \"Will you be buying the dress today?\" Asked the enthusiastic shop assistant. Sarah nodded and told Hanna to change back into her shirt and jeans while Kate told Sarah where to find the tills. After Sarah had paid for the dress, she and Hanna made to leave. Just as they reached the door Kate came jogging up. \"Sorry.\" She said to Hanna \"I just wanted to ask. Where are you from?\" Hanna looked to Sarah who just gave a shrug. \"From the forest.\" She answered. And for a moment Kate's face became and ocean of wonder and curiosity. Then Hanna and Sarah left. 0 Sarah watched Hanna through the rear view mirror as the young girl inspected the dress in more detail. \"So.\" She said, after a while. \"Kate seemed nice.\" Hanna answered in her usual quiet fashion \"She was nice.\" \"I think she liked you. Thought you were nice as well.\" Hanna answered this assertion with a small blush. Sarah swallowed and gathered her courage \"Did, Eric Heller ever explain the birds and the bees to you Hanna?\" Hanna blushed even redder \"He explained reproduction. But he never explained what to do when you feel, affection for someone.\" Sarah suddenly became very aware she was talking to someone who'd had all of two friends in her whole life. And had actually spoken to less than a dozen other human beings. \"Well. You just talk to them.\" Hanna looked at Sarah, almost pleadingly \"About what?\" \"Well, anything. Films, books, music. Whatever you're both interested in.\" Answered the Agent \"If I were you. I would wait till the weekend, go to the shop and ask her out for coffee. If she says yes, you both go to the nearest coffee place and talk for a while.\" Sarah stopped her explanation to pull into a motel car-park. \"Just be confident.\" She added \"But most of all be yourself.\" Please remember to review ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own, nor claim to own Hanna which is the property of it's rightful owners.

Part 1 of 3: Treats Winter was the bad time. Cold, dark, wet. The old cabin was creaky and full of holes. At night it could be bad, if the wind was blowing from the east, away from the tree line and cutting through the chinks in the rough-hewn boards. Hanna thought sometimes the little cabin would blow away in the wind and land far away, on the icy lake, partially frozen this time of year and susceptible to breakages. Her father said this could not happen, and so far it never had. The summers were warm and bright, green, with the birds back in their homes. Summer was the best time. They stayed up late, when the sun didn't set until after midnight, her father reading from the books, or telling her stories. Hanna liked the stories best. It was summer now. The lake was melted, even if never warm. The quiet was gone. Footsteps were muffled in the snow, sound absorbed in the airy ice clinging to tree branches. Stalking was easy in winter, and that meant it was easy to be stalked. Hanna did not rest easy when she could be hunted. Summer was dry branches on the ground and crackling leaves underfoot. She knew how to navigate them. Her father did too, but few others could. She was safe. Safer. Closer to it. One day that summer her father packed a sack full of something she didn't see. He didn't leave very often. Sometimes once a year, sometimes less. He left nineteen months ago and was gone eight days and seventeen hours. Hanna was scared then. But she was bigger now, almost nine, and she wasn't very much afraid anymore when she saw he was leaving. She set down the ax. The blisters were coming back on her hands, softened from last year when she'd last chopped wood. During the winter the logs were too frozen to chop, so they used collected wood from the forest floor. Her father always had her chop the wood. He was stronger, but it was her job. \"I am leaving for the town,\" he said. He stopped halfway between the door and the woodpile, looking down the path that led away, far away to places Hanna had never been. He had put on his knit cap to cover his unruly hair. Hanna asked him about it once and he said it was so the locals didn't stare. She wondered if people would stare at her if she went to the town. Maybe if she had a hat like that, he would let her go sometime. Hanna picked up her ax again. Her father did not like her to be idle. She gripped it firmly, left hand around the neck, closer to the top, right hand about the middle, thumbs wrapped around . Her fingers didn't reach all the way. He said she'd grow into it. She heaved it above her shoulder, swinging it past her legs, and connected the arch to the lug of wood on the tree stump. As the ax fell she loosened her grip slightly, allowing the momentum of the head to give extra force to the blow. This made up for her limited upper body strength. The wood split cleanly. \"We are low on ammunition,\" she said to her father. She gave him a glance now and then, in between throwing the split wood onto an ever-growing pile and replacing it with a chunk of log. \"Nine millimeter, eight gauge, and twenty-four,\" she said. He kept watching the path, as if expecting something to come down it. He always expected that. Hanna did too. No one had ever come down it before, except her and her father. But they kept expecting it just the same. It was safer that way. \"I counted. You are off a little. We still have two hundred rounds of the twenty-four.\" Hanna thought about that. He corrected her often. \"Better to have too much than too little,\" she said eventually. She saw him nod. \"I will be gone until next week. Maybe a little later,\" he said. That was normal. The town was four days journey away. Sometimes he found a ride and hitched part of the way. That allowed him to go faster, but even so, it was unlikely to take less than seven days. It felt like too long. Hanna always worried. \"Don't talk to strangers, Papa. And don't forget to always wear your hat,\" she said. He smiled a little, although she did not see it. An eight year old girl would be here defenseless in the woods, and she worried about him. But, of course, she was not defenseless. \"I want the smokehouse repaired by the time I am back,\" he said. \"And your lessons read every night. No skipping. I'll know if you do.\" Hanna believed him. \"Stay in at night. And keep the Rules.\" Hanna nodded. The Rules were sacred. Don't let anyone see you. Don't leave the woods. Keep on guard. Adapt or die. He hitched his pack further up his shoulders, eyes on his daughter. \"Goodbye, Hanna,\" he said. Hanna dropped the ax and ran to him. She closed her tiny arms around his waist with surprising strength. \"Take me with you. I will keep you safe,\" she whispered. Her father swallowed hard. Her little heart beat like a rabbit's against his stomach. \"No. I have something important in the town. You will stay.\" \"What if you get lost?\" the little girl responded, voice muffled against his coat. \"I'm much too clever to get lost. Did you ever hear of your father getting lost?\" \"No,\" she said, but she bit her lip. Hanna did not cry much. Even as a baby she hadn't, and she didn't now. Her father held her for a moment. Then he said, \"How about this. We'll use the radio. I take one, and you use the one in the cabin. You check on me every night. I'll tell you when I'm coming home.\" Her eyes lit up, she smiled, and nodded. She scampered to the cabin, emerging a moment later with an ancient looking two-way radio. He put it into his pack. \"We'll check in every night at twenty-one hundred hours. Affirmative?\" \"Affirmative,\" Hanna said, the word coming out with military precision from an eight year old's mouth. He scooped her up and hugged her. He whispered into her ear, \"Remember, don't leave the forest, no matter what happens. Promise me.\" \"I promise,\" she said. \"Good.\" He set her down. \"And since you're such a good girl, I'll give you a treat, just this once.\" Hanna tried to hide her smile. Treats were rare, and it was not a good idea to get too excited over them. But she was. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a ball wrapped in brightly colored paper. He held it out to her and she stared at it for a good long second before snatching it up. She held it up to her eyes, then sniffed it. \"It's bubble gum,\" her father said. \"I think you will like it.\" With great concentration, she pulled the ends of the wrapper, slowly rotating it from its paper prison until the thing was unwrapped. The ball inside was chalky pink. \"Just chew. Don't swallow.\" She popped it into her mouth, and said through a sticky sugary smile, \"Thank you, Papa.\" He nodded and began down the path. \"Papa!\" Hanna called. He stopped and turned. \"I don't know how to blow bubbles!\" \"I'll teach you when I get back, Hanna.\" He waved and she waved back. He went down the long path to the town while Hanna tried to teach herself to blow bubbles.[Chapter 2] Hanna is the property of Focus Features. Part 2 of 3: Tricks In the summer, Hanna's home was very bright. The sun stayed up for hours and the night was short. Her father explained this to her by reading from the books. Latitudes above 60 degrees north remained exposed to the rays of the sun for approximately sixteen hours during the months of June, July, and August, with the length of days decreasing by six minutes daily after June 21. He had read this four times already and Hanna still did not quite understand it. It was nearing twenty-one-hundred hours. Hanna observed the two-way radio from its perch on a shelf opposite the fireplace. It was a very ancient and special machine. Her father told her once how he had purchased it from a black marketeer in East Berlin before she was born. Hanna could not picture what East Berlin looked like. Her father told her it was a bad place, so maybe it was better if she couldn't. The radio was not dusty. Her father kept it covered under an oiled cloth that was never removed. It operated by petrol, which they could not get very often. It was always kept full from the five litre can stored under the floor, in case it was ever needed. Now and then, Hanna's father checked the machine, running a cloth over the shiny parts and observing the fuel level. So far, they had never needed it. Hanna wondered why her father wanted to keep it if they had no use for it. She was not usually allowed to touch it, although her father had taught her how. He showed her the knobs which supplied power, the tuning mechanism, the frequency controls, how to hold the microphone and earpiece and speak into it. The radio was a source of wonder and Hanna was excited to use it. She thought about her father, far away on the road to the town, with the portable set stashed away in the pack. He would be setting it out on a table or similar surface now, adjusting the frequency, checking the fuel, just as she was. This image made her smile. With deliberate motions, she turned the radio on. It emitted a high-pitched whine, crackling static floating through the cabin. She felt a thrill go through her. Tonight she would talk to her father on the radio! There were no clocks in the cabin. Instead, Hanna used a small aluminum wristwatch that had no bands. Her father called it post-war, although she was not exactly sure what that meant. It was inscribed in Cyrillic words on the back that said it was made in Uzbekistan. Hanna supposed this meant it was Soviet. Most of all, it worked, and it was only a few minutes before twenty one hundred hours. She adjusted the frequency knobs. Her father was out there, doing the same. If Hanna had been the kind of girl who had learned how to giggle, she would have now. Instead, she turned it to the correct frequency with calm deliberation. The static grew less violent. Crackly snow came through the headset. She checked the watch again. It was time. \"Papa?\" When he taught her how to use the radio, her father had instructed her to use Japanese when speaking through it. Their region had minimal Japanese speakers, so they would not be listened to. \"It's Hanna. It's twenty one hundred hours. I turned it on like you said. And I remembered to use Japanese. And I read my lessons, really.\" She really had, and she hoped her father believed her. The static poured through her ears. She held down the receiver and spoke again. \"Papa. Are you there? It's me and I'm waiting.\" She lifted the receiver and waited. Nothing. Hanna became alarmed. When her father set a schedule, it must never under any circumstances be broken. His exact orders must be followed with military precision promptly and accurately. To deviate from established orders was to risk exposure, intelligence breakdown, and death. Hanna pressed the receiver again. \"I know you didn't forget, Papa, so why aren't you answering me?\" When Hanna encountered an obstacle, she did not become afraid. She evaluated the situation and determined a course of action that optimized favorable results. She assessed her current position. Her father was not using his radio. He was either unable to operate it, or unable to reach it. In the first case, he could be in a location outside the radio's range. Underground, or behind a solid obstacle such as a mountain. The radio may have broken during his journey. In the second case, he might be away from his pack. Or it might have been stolen. Hanna did not think her father would have ever allowed this. He could be injured to the point of incapacitation. Or captured. Or dead. Hanna was not afraid. She was only gripping the microphone with white knuckles because she was concentrating, that was all. The journey to the town took three and a half days. He had left thirty four hours ago. He would still be in the forest unless he had acquired impromptu transportation. Even then, averaging forty kilometers an hour, providing he'd found transportation immediately upon reaching the road and used it the entire twenty nine hours minimum, that would make him at least eighty kilometers from the town. There were no habitations between the points. There was the possibility of migrant hunters camping along the way. This happened infrequently, however, and was not likely. He was in the forest. Maybe on the road. Where was he? The weather was fair. Twenty degrees Celsius, too warm to risk hypothermia or danger from exposure. It had been dry the past week. Eighty kilometers distant was close enough that she would see storm clouds if further south was receiving rain. There were no sizable predator populations above 58 degrees north. Wolf populations had been decimated by five decades of government-affirmed predation. Bears avoided the tundra and were little threat during the summer months. Her father knew how to handle wildlife. So where was he? Human presence was limited. Occasional foresters and hunters, typically in the autumn months. Infrequently backpackers and sight seers during spring and summer. No military action nearby. No habitations. Unknown hostile parties were possible. Hanna breathed hard. She wasn't afraid. But where was he? \"Papa? Papa? You must be in the forest because you can't have traveled more than ninety kilometers in thirty nine hours and there are no bears or flash floods and I made sure you had the Luger and the watch says twenty one hundred fourteen and you promised you'd check with me.\" She forgot to speak in Japanese and she remembered after a moment to let the receiver down so she could hear a reply. But there wasn't one. It was not dark outside. Hanna thought about the sun's rays hitting above sixty degrees north for much longer than they should all the way into August and wondered if her father saw the light wherever he was. She stared at the radio with its gentle humming sound fueled by petrol and listened to the empty static over the headset. Click. Click. She froze. She turned everything off in her mind and listened to the radio. Click. She didn't dare press the receiver to speak, for fear she would miss it. Static. Then, faintly, a human voice. A murmur, inaudible, shuffling sounds. A metallic clink. Then, a human sound again. A groan. Her father's voice. \"Papa? Papa?\" her voice pitched to frenzy as she depressed the receiver in panic. \"...Hanna...I...\" Garbled noise, and she heard with a throb in her chest what was unmistakably a cry of pain. \"Papa!\" Hanna stared at the tiny blinking diode of the radio. It blinked red and faint. \"Help me...Hanna...\" She screamed, wordlessly, no longer worried she wouldn't hear what was on the other end. She jumped from the table, almost upsetting the radio, and threw off the headset. On the scarred wood of the rough hewn boards, the static continued, pulsing through the headset like endless snow.[Chapter 3] Part 3 of 3: Test During the last winter, when the snow piled up too high to leave the cabin, Hanna's father had taught her how to use RDF triangulation. He showed her the little box that found the direction of the radio source, and how to use a map and compass points to determine where the transmission came from. Hanna found it difficult, but she'd gotten it in the end. The radio direction finder was tucked in her pack, alongside the most accurate map she had of the forest, and a compass. She walked at a brisk pace, occasionally breaking into a trot, westward through the forest. If she walked too slowly, she heard her father's cries replaying in her head. The first set of directional readings had been taken at the cabin. 160 degrees. She repeated it so she wouldn't forget. Once she was a mile or so distant from the cabin, she would take another reading. But only if the radio was still transmitting. Was it? It had to be, her father needed it to be so she could save him. Then she would use the pair of readings to triangulate the source. 160 degrees, don't forget. Hanna was out of breath when she stopped to use the RDF. She hoped it was far enough now to give an accurate reading. She spread the folded map on the ground and took out the heavy box, all dials and switches. She tried to remember how her father had said to set them up. 160 degrees. She tuned it in. There was no frequency responding. But there had to be, her father needed her. She tried it again, stood with it above her head, pointed it in different directions. No, no, no. Hanna did not know how to pray. The books mentioned these things sometimes, but she had never seen anyone doing it, and had never thought about it much. As she kneeled on a patch of damp earth next to the map, though, she wished with all her might that she would pick up her father's signal again and be able to find him. It was as good as a prayer for a girl who didn't know how. The RDF gave a bleep. Hanna scrambled up and adjusted the knobs. 230 degrees. Was it the right radio signal? It did not occur to her that it might be someone else's. She plotted it on the map, and with a stubby pencil, drew the lines from 160 degrees to 230 degrees. They crossed in the end point of a triangle, and Hanna knew where her father was. She moved fast. The miles sped past her and she became tired, but she kept going. She tried to keep on the watch for enemies, but she could not pull her thoughts from the single-minded pursuit of those coordinates on the map. Three miles left, then two. She stopped only to check her bearings on the compass. It was getting dark. At home, Hanna was not afraid of the dark. She knew the cabin and the lake and woods around it and she had her father there to protect her. Here, she was afraid. She held her pistol and tried to be brave. It must be close now. She slowed, feeling the tightness in her chest. If the enemy was nearby, she wouldn't be able to fight them if she couldn't catch her breath. Her father needed her to be ready to fight. The pistol in her hand, she moved cautiously, watching for evil things to leap out at her. She almost missed it. Something caught the corner of her eye and she turned back to look again. There, a flash of something gray and smooth, foreign in the tangle of branches and leaves. Cautiously, her pistol at the ready, she moved towards it. The leaves were still damp here and softened her footsteps. The gray thing was a corner, and she saw the rest of it was some kind of flat, even rock in the shape of a little house. She had never seen one before, but she knew it was a guard shack. Guard shacks meant people. People meant enemies. Hanna crouched beneath the cover of a pine tree., her breathing hard. There appeared no one about. She scanned the treetops, looking for blinds that might conceal the enemy, but there was nothing. It was very quiet. There were no trails coming from the shack, no roads for vehicles or even footpaths. No way to know if anyone even used it. Next she examined the shack. It was small, about eight feet square. The roof was rusted tin but looked strong. There was one door and no windows. It had no other features. This was very strange. Papa had never mentioned a guard post out here, so far away from the town. Did he even know about it? What if someone had set it up a long time ago so they could spy on her and her father without them ever knowing? Maybe the spies had captured her father and now hid inside this very shack. Hanna shivered under the pine tree. She crouched down low as she snuck away from the tree. She moved in a wide circle around the shack, hugging the trees and scrub . She saw nothing that indicated human presence in her perimeter sweep. On the back side of the shack, however, she found a small ventilation grate set into the lower wall. It was so small that in a year or two she would not be able to fit into it, but she thought just maybe she could do it now. Hanna was a careful girl. She waited outside the shack, occasionally circling around again, for the better part of an hour, in case the enemy showed up. But no one did, so she crawled closer to the shack, as silently as she could. Finally, she made it to the wall with the grate. She paused, examining the smoothness of the building, wondering how they found a rock in such a perfect shape. She held her ear to it and heard nothing. She removed her pack but kept the pistol. The grate was metal and she could see no method of its fixture to the wall. With her fingernails, she tried to pry it away. It did not budge. She used a stick as a wedge between the grate and the wall until it snapped in her hands. Sucking in a breath, she tensed and waited to be found. No one came. Rummaging in her pack, she removed a knife and slowly, slowly, slid it under the grate. It made a soft rasping sound as she ran it all along the edges, but she thought the grate felt a little looser now. With renewed conviction, she set to work gently levering open the grate. It took a long time. Hanna was aching when she realized the grate was almost free. Careful not to rush ahead and make an unnecessary noise, she kept working the knife until the grate, with a gentle grinding sound, freed itself into her hands. She held her breath. This was it. She checked her gun again and pushed herself into the square of blackness. Inside, it was dark. Hanna got her head and shoulders in and was working on freeing her lower body when she heard a click. Instantly, her gun was in her hands, her arms swung around and pointing at the source of the sound, finger on the trigger and icy cold. \"You're too late,\" someone said. From the opposite corner of the room, a gas lamp hissed into life. \"I already killed you,\" said her father. Hanna saw him from upside down, gun automatically readjusting until he was in its sights. He was not bloody and beaten. He looked clean and sad. He was not wearing his hat and in his hands was a shotgun, held loosely and pointed at her. \"Toss it away,\" he told her, and she skidded her gun towards his feet. He did not pick it up. \"Now you must come in,\" he said. Hanna finished scrambling through the vent. By the light of the lamp she saw the room held only a wooden desk with some kind of fancy machinery on it. She recognized a radio transmitter but the rest was foreign to her. Her father stepped forward. \"Kneel, \" he said, and he gestured to the center of the floor. Hanna did. She was ashamed. She had broken the Rules. She had been stupid and reckless. She had made her father sad. Her father began circling her as she stared at the floor. \"What did you promise me, Hanna?\" \"I would stay in the forest. No matter what happened.\" She was glad she did not have to see her father's eyes. \"You have violated the Rules. You disobeyed orders and botched a rescue attempt. Now you and your team are dead. I did not think you would come so quickly,\" he said softly. \"You lied to me,\" Hanna whispered. \"Everyone will lie to you! They will tell you whatever they want to manipulate you and make you do what they want you to do! They all want to use you! Will you let them play with your emotions so they can use you, Hanna?\" \"I thought you were in danger, Papa.\" Her voice became tremulous, her downcast eyes watery. He exploded. \"I do not matter! You are the one who is important, you are the one who must remain safe! If I am in danger you must let me die! I told you that, Hanna! I must keep you safe!\" The girl's shoulders heaved. \"I didn't want you to die, Papa,\" she said through sobs. He stopped circling, the shotgun dipping to the ground, his face crestfallen as he watched the girl trying desperately to stifle her sobs. He felt himself shaking and sucked in a breath, reminding himself what he had to do. After a few moments he set the shotgun down on the desk. He stood in front of his daughter. \"Hanna. Stop crying,\" he said, his voice firm and gentle. Like a good soldier, she did. \"You must promise me forever that if I am in danger, you will save yourself instead of me.\" Hanna looked up, her face pink from crying, clean trails of tears cutting through the dirt on her cheeks. \"I promise forever, Papa,\" she said with solemnity. He nodded, held a hand to her and pulled her up. Retrieving the guns, they left the shack. Hanna's father went around the back and replaced the ventilation grate. \"It was a decent job,\" he told the girl, and she smiled. \"Now we will go home,\" he said, and he swung Hanna onto his back, where she wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his middle. He held the shotgun in one hand and Hanna's pack in the other, and he walked back through the forest, towards the cabin, carrying his daughter.

He wanted to sprint to her side and sweep her off her feet; he wanted to be her knight in shining armor. But he knew better. He trusted what Kate had warned with desperation on her last letter. He calmly sat down on a bench outside of one of the shops across from Kate. He waited. Then, it happened. \"Someone call 911!!!\" Kate screamed at the top of her lungs as she checked the overturned station wagon. She helped the man out of the car. Then, she helped to escort everyone safely and soundly out of the smashed up bus as sirens blared through the air. Alex stood up and smiled to himself as he walked back to where he had come from.

On good days, he wonders if he can make the distance. On bad days, he has moved on entirely, only remembering her as a ghost in a forgotten dream. Listen in to his thoughts. o Unseasonable weather always reminded him of her , of Kate. He remembered the miraculous way, that balmy February, they had met. Christ , it was hard to forget. Who would have thought that they could communicate through words written on paper, delivered, miraculously and ghostlike, though their mutual letter box? It began that day back in 2004, when he had just moved into the picturesque house on the lake his father had designed and built. It had been vacant for quite some time and in need of some tender love and care. No sooner had he moved in than he'd received a note from the so-called (and non-existent) \"past tenant\", thinking her quite insane. They began leaving notes for each other, conversing. It took a while for them to figure out that they were communicating from the same day only two years apart! Him being in the past and she supposedly in the future. Once they got past that initial disbelief and, not to mention, surprise , it had all unfolded naturally. In fact, so effortlessly one could almost suspect their growing relationship was divinely inspired. Their bantering chit-chat had unfolded spontaneously, each of them savouring the little notes they received from the other. Soon, it no longer seemed to matter that the very fact they could talk was itself a bizarre miracle. It had almost become commonplace, well, except for the time loops and paradoxes that sprung up now and then as her past intersected his present. Her past she could not change, but his present was still very much under his control and guidance. She wrote him and asked that he pick up her prized copy of Jane Austin's Persuasion , which she had left at a train station and was subsequently never seen again. That was when he had gotten his first glance at the dark-haired beauty with the mysterious but sad eyes. To say he had been hooked would be an understatement. By some miracle, in the form of his pet dog (that had turned up the day he moved into the Lake House, before going on to be her pet dog years later) he had been led to Kate's boyfriend's, Morgan's, house. Alex, realising that the Kate Morgan was seeing was the same as his Kate, took advantage of his hospitality and his invitation to attend Kate's party. There they had kissed, she \"meeting\" him for the first time, unaware of who he was. He, knowing she would meet him in the future and begin to fall for him. The kiss had obviously been fated, anyone could have seen that. Even Kate, in the future, eventually put two and two together and realised it was him. It was all so entwined; that was one reason it was so romantic. Sure, it would have been romantic if they met in real time and dated in the ordinary way. But this time loop thing went beyond romance and into the realm of magic or, perhaps, divine intervention. So what did it all mean? Really, what did it? Nowadays, Alex honestly had to wonder. So much time had passed for him. Not Kate though â€“ she was spared that. It was June of 2007 and she had only been corresponding with him via the Lake House mailbox for one year and a bit. But for him, he had known her since the start of 2004! He had already waited two years, at the end of which his life had been saved by her. He knew that it was he who had been hit by that bus whilst crossing the road to Daley Plaza, hit and killed. It had begun the whole chain of events that led her to feel homesick for the Lake House and pay it a visit. There she had found the letter he had posted for herâ€¦.and it all had begunâ€¦. But in this version of reality, he was not dead. Eventually she had realised that, on that fateful Valentine's day, the man she had tried and failed to save was Alex. By warning him in advance, she had stopped him just in time, stopped him from trying to meet her. For a relationship that was so fated even time couldn't keep them apart, Fate sure was making it hard for them now! Or more correctly, for him . He could not touch her now, could not reach out or contact her. Painfully slowly, she was going through the stage right now of writing the very letters that he had received and cherished in 2005. It was new to her, and exciting. It wouldn't be until the day they tried to meet in Il Mare, the day he never showed because he had been killed by the bus, that she would walk away. So despondent had she been by his no-show she had broken it off. It had been their first and only spat, and it resulted in her halting her correspondence with him. She wasn't to know he couldn't show up at the restaurant because he had been dead. He couldn't change the situation whilst she was telling him that, in her time, he was the one who was a no-show â€“ he couldn't control that. She thought he didn't care, but of course he did, and nothing could have prevented him that day from meeting her, nothing, that is, except Fate. How could he argue with Fate? Fate had stopped him cold because, presumably, it wasn't time. Fate had divine timing mapped out; and seemingly by going against that time, he would flatten himself under a heavy vehicle. He knew she was waiting for him now! Well, her in the future was waiting for him. Her in the now hadn't even argued with him yet. But he knew the future because she had finally broken her silence and reached out over time to tell him of his fate. She wrote to him from Valentine's day 2008. She saved his life in 2006 and told him toâ€¦. wait. Alex, I know why you didn't show up that night. It was you at Daley Plaza that day. It was you. Please, don't go. Just wait. Please don't look for me. Don't try to find me. I love you. And it's taken me all this time to say it, but I love you. And if you still care for me, wait for me. Wait with me. Just wait. Wait. Wait two years, Alex. Come to the Lake House. I'm here. Her meaning was clear; it was all clear. He couldn't go near her or touch her â€“ it added up to unforseen tragedy and bus flattenings. He could not deliberately affect her \"now\" (which was his past.) She was supposed to fight with him, leave him, then renew her relationship with her old boyfriend, Morgan. If Alex chimed into her life, swaggered in now, all that had happened in his past would be rewritten. It was the time loop. It was death or tragedy to mess with it, that much was clear. Only by waiting two years, by reaching \"the date\" as he called it - the very day she wrote that last letter, could they begin on the same page, thus escaping the paradox of intersecting his past and her future. And he had meant to wait. It seemed such an easy task, after all. It required no action; in fact it demanded no action. Simply by existing and being there on that day in 2008, he knew she would be at the Lake House, waiting for him too, loving him. It was only time. Just time. But maybe, after all, it was too much. Because time changed too much. While for her a matter of minutes would pass between writing that note and meeting him there, for him it was two years. A lot changed in two years. Love could vanish in two years. Faith could be lost. He could be lost, and he felt lost right now. He didn't know if he could keep the faith. In fact, he rather suspected that he had already lost it somewhere on the way. Somewhere along the way of waking up every morning alone, of having no one to chat to during the day, having no one to come home to at night. It gives a man a lot of time to think, and to doubt. Doubt nagged at him, causing him to question. One degree left of questioning was disbelief. It had all been so strange in the first place, miraculously so; how could he possibly keep up that belief now that he was here alone, waiting, unable to contact her, unwilling to take the risk to watch her even? Faith and belief evaporated on the wind. Did he ever really love this woman he'd only met in the flesh once ? Was it a ridiculous and cruel joke? He was at the point where days went by when he forgot to think of her, then weeks could go by with him engrossed in his life, such as it was, with not a single thought or memory of her. Too much time . He had been waiting since 2004, and had a little less than one year left, but stillâ€¦.one year! He doubted it was worth it, to be brutally honest. If another woman came into his life now, he would take her. Hell, he'd snap up any opportunity if it came his way. Not due to desperation, but simply to make a life, like all normal people did. Yet no one else had come along, so far. But if they did, he wouldn't hesitate. He wondered if that was really the mentality of someone who was waiting for their love to come back to them. He knew it wasn't. Whatever business Fate had in connecting the two of them and promising him a chance with her in the futureâ€¦.it was clearly wrong. Perhaps that is just how Fate worked. It was at this point he realised he had fizzled himself out. That first year had been wonderful for him. Constantly giddy with what they were doing, with their special, almost inter-dimensional, communication. Not to mention how much he had worshipped her. Oh yes, he had, feverishly longing to touch her, to have her. He had been waiting even back then. As Fate had it, he never knew he would have to keep on waiting. The first blossom of love was spent alone with her paper notes and a promise, words! Those fervent years of wishing for her, wasted. Now the bloom had fallen off the rose, the promise became meaninglessâ€¦ time, endless time stretching on as it always did. The odyssey over, the endingâ€¦.unwritten, true, but too far off for him to care. He couldn't hold onto that intensity of feeling for four whole years . Something had to give, and it had. Now he just hoped that she would understand. He knew he had no intention of waiting for her now. He had moved on, without knowing or meaning to, but nonetheless he had. She would get over it. She would just be glad that he was alive, that she had changed the course of his history and that Valentine's at Daley Plaza. And they would be friends. She had left him once for Morgan; she had not given him a second chance. Now he too had wandered, and she would have to accept it. Just good friends, nothing more. Wandering through the blind spot, knowing she could not write to him of the future any more, he was content. She would understand, and they would be friends. Now, he really had to get back to his life, plant his feet on the ground once more, and forget about any of this inter-dimensional, time loop stuff involving romance, love and Fate. He'd been there and done that. Now, despite the one date he still had with her on the Valentine's of 2008, it was time to simply live in the real world. It was the only healthy and sane way to live, and he embraced it. Inter-dimensional romance only led to heartache and endless questions. But he was on the right path now, wasn't he? Wasn't he? He really wished he wasn't the only person to have this happen to them. Why couldn't someone else tell him what to do? He just needed someone else to guide him. He didn't have the answers and could no longer satisfactorily wait for them. It was just thatâ€¦.This Never Happened Beforeâ€¦ ","Summary":" Can Faith Hold? o Alex begins to doubt his experiences with Kate during his two year wait for her. "},{"Movie":"Lake House","Title":"Worth the Wait","Author":"nothingtolose18","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7530340","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Reviews are love. No, I don't own The Lake House, Sandra Bullock, or Keanu Reeves. Just a little oneshot I wanted to write for a movie I adore. It doesn't go exactly by the movie-although the plot is generally the same, I've changed the words and inserted a lot of thoughts and things. Hope you enjoy! Much as Kate tried to fool herself, she wasn't really over Alex. She'd catch herself thinking about him often, even when she was around Morgan. Then she'd remind herself of that embarrassing night at the restaurant, where she'd sat, like an idiot, by herself all night waiting for a date that didn't show, and she'd try to push Alex out of her mind. Still, he wouldn't leave. But time was creeping forward, and it wasn't bringing her any closer to her mystery man. She thought again of the little girl she'd been checking up on that night in the hospital, who told her about her mother and how she was always looking for someone better. Kate thought that maybe that was what she had been doing herself. How did she know that Alex was truly out there, and that he loved her? Morgan was here and now, and he loved her in his own way, and maybe that was enough. Maybe that was who she was meant to be with. And so, despite her feelings for Alex, Kate stayed with Morgan, and they began to plan their life together. Kate kept Alex close to her heart, but he began to fade into the background slowly. Morgan was a good guy underneath it all, and she knew that he wouldn't leave her stranded. Morgan was nothing if not dependable. Finally, Valentine's Day of 2008 rolled around. Kate had gotten Morgan a little Valentine card for the occasion, though she wasn't expecting anything in return. Morgan loved her, but he didn't really pay attention to any dates beside business dates. She wasn't sure he would even clue in until she told him herself. She and Morgan had an appointment that day at Visionary Vanguard Associates, a new up-and-coming architect office. They were planning on doing renovations to their home, which delighted Morgan. Kate liked coming up with new ideas, but she still longed to live in her lake house. Still, she knew that Morgan, with his busy work schedule, would never agree to live in the house on the lake. He needed to live in the hustle and bustle of the city. The appointment time rolled around, and she met Morgan at the architect's office. He had just gotten off work. They sat together in the chairs in the waiting room, and she produced the Valentine's Day card for him. \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. She could see it took a minute for the gears to click into place, but when they did he looked properly ashamed. \"I'm so sorry Kate, it completely slipped my mind.\" \"It's okay,\" she said with a smile, patting his hand. She'd been expecting that response. \"Open it!\" At that moment, the office door opened. Morgan hurriedly stuffed the card into his jacket pocket. A young man greeted them with a friendly smile, shaking both their hands. \"Henry Wyler. Hope I didn't keep you waiting long?\" he asked, standing aside to allow them room to enter. \"No, not at all,\" Morgan said pleasantly, sitting down at the table in the middle of the room. He waited for Kate to sit down, and when she didn't he glanced up at her, confused. \"Kate? Are you..?\" Something had caught her eye. She was staring, transfixed, at a drawing of the lake house hung on the wall â€¦ her lake house. She stepped forward, enthralled, and laid one hand delicately on the surface. \"Who drew this?\" she asked in amazement. \"My brother Alex,\" Henry said, and the pride was evident in his voice. \"Did you know him?\" Kate's heart began to pound as she put two and two together. Alex â€¦ an architect â€¦ my lake house â€¦ it has to be him! \"Yes, I do. Do you have a number or address where I could get in touch with him?\" she queried, still staring at the beautiful sketch of her former house. She knew that Morgan was probably wondering what the hell was going on, but suddenly the need to see, actually see, Alex was so strong that it was almost palpable. Maybe they could work things out. Maybe she'd been too quick to throw away their relationship. Henry cleared his throat uncomfortably, and something about the way he did so made Kate turn to look at him. \"I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but my brother passed away â€¦ two years ago today, actually. There was an accidentâ€¦\" His face was still open and friendly, but it was easy to detect the sadness in his eyes. Time stood still. The world was suddenly spinning at a much slower speed, and it was all Kate could do to not fall down. Her legs buckled at the knees precariously. \"What?\" She was aware of the fact that her voice was high-pitched and shrill, and that she was dangerously on the verge of tears. \"No, he didn't. That can't be right.\" Henry shook his head, looking at her curiously. She wondered how much, if anything, he knew of her. \"I'm so sorry.\" Suddenly it was hard for Kate to breathe. She remembered what she'd done on February 14th, 2006. She remembered it quite well, because for a while it had haunted her dreams. She'd held a man in her arms and watched him die before her eyes. She'd struggled to save him, but had had to let him go. Suddenly the details bubbled to the forefront of her mind; the face she'd been too busy trying to save to recognize. The tousled hair, the chiselled features. The very same man she'd kissed two years before at her birthday party, the man to whom she'd confessed things she would never have thought of telling Morgan. It was Alex; it had to be Alex. Suddenly Kate was running; running out of the office and out of the building and out onto the streets, running as fast as she could, running in her heels even though they pinched her toes painfully. She could hear Morgan yelling behind her, and she knew that he, and the rest of the city, probably thought she was crazy, but she didn't care. She had to get to the lake house. It was too late in her time, but it may not be too late in his. She fell, panting, into the driver's seat of her car and turned it on as quickly as she could. She had to get to the lake house and send him a letter. Once again, time was her greatest hurdle, keeping her from the man she finally realized she loved. \"Please don't cross that street,\" she begged aloud, blaring her horn at the car in front of her, who was taking his sweet time driving even though the light had just turned green. She didn't want to have an accident herself, but she still couldn't help speeding her way to the lake house. Luckily, traffic wasn't too heavy, and she made it there fairly quickly. Still, her heart was pounding with fear as she screeched to a halt in front of her former home. She quickly hauled out the pad of paper she'd began keeping in her glove compartment after beginning correspondance with Alex. She didn't have time to begin with pleasantries. She started to write. Alex, I know that you want to be with me. But please, wait. Wait for me. Don't cross that street when you see me. Just wait. I'll be here on Valentine's Day of 2008, at the lake house. I love you. I've finally realized that I love you. Please wait. Please. It's the only thing I ask. Don't try to find meâ€¦just wait. She hurriedly jumped out of the car, not bothering to shut the door behind her, and stuffed it into the mailbox. \"Please,\" she whispered, praying that she wasn't too late to save him. \"Please, please, please wait. Don't cross that road, Alex. Wait.\" The minutes seemed to drag by, and the overwhelming emotions began to take their toll on Kate. Oh God, I was too lateâ€¦ Tears were streaming down her face as she waited, terrified of what she was going to do if he didn't show up. Finally, an old blue car made its way around the curve and into the lot. A man jumped out, and all they could do was stare at each other. She was in shock, seeing the face that she'd last seen two years ago as he lay dying in the middle of the road, the face of the man that she felt certain she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. Back then, that man had been a stranger to her, but through some miracle, some wonder, he'd become something much more to her. This must be how destiny felt. \"You waited,\" she breathed, and suddenly they were kissing with a passion that Kate had never felt before. She didn't want to ever let him go. \"I waited,\" he echoed, pulling away long enough to smile down at her. \"And it was one hell of a wait, let me tell youâ€¦\" \"Mine, too,\" she confessed, interlocking her hand with his. \"Was it worth it?\" \"Definitely,\" he whispered, squeezing her hand as they began making their way down the walkway to their lake house. \"Definitely.\" ","Summary":" A/N: Reviews are love.

He had never met such a beautiful, intelligent, beautiful, perfect woman before, absolutely not. Sure, he had relationships before, but most of them had been flings, or turned ugly. At the beginning, it was mostly the girls who sought him out, who giggled and blushed flirtatiously while asking him out. When he agreed, it was mostly to humour them. But this was different. He felt an attraction towards this lady, this stranger he only knew from her letters, that he couldn't resist. Somehow, deep inside him. He felt that she was different. In some way that he just couldn't explain. She wouldn't call herself a playgirl. She went to clubs, she couldn't deny that, she drank, yes, but in her dictionary that hardly constituted as being a playgirl. She had a few relationships before, but most of them just didn't work out. The guy was too demanding, maybe, or too busyâ€¦there were loads of reasons. But here she was, at her birthday party, swaying to a love song in the arms of a guy she had just met. Unbelievable. I met you and now I'm sure When Morgan had called his girlfriend Kate and said that she was a doctor, he felt his heart stop, his breath catch in his throat. Was this the same Kate they were referring to? If so, Kate had a boyfriend? He felt his heart sink. She was living with him, so they had to be pretty close. Then why did she say she was single? And why did she act like she was interested in him? Maybe she wasn't, maybe it was just his imagination fooling him. Regardless, he had to see her. So he went. When he saw her, he knew instantly. It was her. Even dressed casually, she looked wonderful. When she unlocked the door, the room was all dark. She paused, then sighed resignedly. Morgan was late home again. But the lights flicked on and Morgan led a group of people, singing a birthday song, holding out a layered cake with candles on top. \"ohhhâ€¦\" she let out, delighted that Morgan had thought of organizing this for her, for even remembering her birthday. She noticed a man in the crowd, standing directly behind Morgan , waving tentatively and diffidently at her. He was dressed in a brown pullover and pants, but he looked really handsome. Their eyes locked for a fleeting moment and he smiled. Unconsciosuly, she grinned back, feeling her stomach flutter. This never happened before He tightened his grip around her and she let herself be pulled closer. It was a long time since he had danced with a girl so intimately, isolated in the soft moonlight. He didn't know about her, but he thought it was a really romantic atmosphere. It had been a long time since his last true love and he had forgotten how it felt like, to hold a woman, so pliant, so vulnerable, so trusting, in his arms. She rested her cheek against his chest. A voice inside her was screaming hysterically, \"what do you think you're doing, Kate? Here you are, at your own birthday party, dancing with a guy you barely know! Why??? Stop right now, before Morgan sees!\" the other one was completely oblivious to everyone and everything around her as she murmured inwardly, \"Mmmmâ€¦this feels goodâ€¦this guy is hot and Morgan hardly dances with me. In fact, he never has. This guyâ€¦I don't know how to say it, but he's not just some ordinary guy. I've got this feeling about itâ€¦he's importantâ€¦\" \" Bullshit! You're kidding yourself, you're fantasizingâ€¦how can he be someone important in your life? Yes, he'll be important if Morgan comes out now and breaks up with you because of him!\" but the other voice was reveling in the pleasure she felt, too content and happy to retort. Now I see, this is the way it's supposed to be He was invited as a last-minute guest by Kate's boyfriend; he really had no right to be standing there dancing with the birthday girl. Mona seemed to like him, but that feeling wasn't mutual. He went along with her because he didn't want to hurt her, and he had been so relieved when Jack ran away just when she was asking him out. He had been racking his mind frantically for a way to demur without offending her; thankfully she seemed to have forgotten. He had come to love writing to Kate and anticipating her replies. He had only known her then by her prose, by her style of writing, the way she worded her sentences, her handwriting. But words were more important than he anticipated: especially in a place where only they could exist. But now, he could finally meet her, talk to her, more importantly, dance with her...he was elated. Guilt ebbed in her like a wave, coming and going . She felt like she was having an extra-marital affair. Angrily, she tried to shake it away. This was ludicrous! She wasn't married or even engaged to Morgan, why should she feel that way? Anyway, Morgan had not exactly been an awesome and supportive boyfriend. This...this was different. This felt right. Morgan should be the one dancing with her, though, not staying inside to entertain the guests. If she confronted him, she could just imagine his reaction, \" Are you crazy, Kate? those people are your friends, people who care about you, and some of them are my business associates! I don't want to ruin my reputation, or have people think i'm an ungracious host, you know!\" he wouldn't understand. People would not hold it against him, they understand. Anyway, who cares...he had probably not even noticed her absence. I met you and now I see He remembered how her eyes seemed to twist into his (he couldn't think of any other way to describe it) when they first met. At that time, he felt like some connection had been made, some invisible bond had been forged. They were connected, really, in many ways. They were both to live in the lake house, just at different times; they were both single, and kinda lonely; they both needed each other. It paine dhim, actually, to know that although he had many memories of their correspondence (he didn't think 'courtship' was the right word), she didn't know that two years later, she would be so close to him, although time was the barrier that stood between them. To her, he was probably just some dashing stranger and this dance, however important to him, was probably just for fun to her. Her hands ran down his shoulders and rested on his back. She felt his muscles beneath his shirt: so tense, so taut, such a palatable feeling. He seemed perfect to her. This is the way it should be He swayed to ther rhythm, pulling her with him. she wished this song would last forever...well, a little longer, at least, so they could keep on dancing. This is the way it should be for lovers Lovers? Is that what he could call them? well, in 2006, maybe, but certainly not now. He glanced at Kate's face. Does she know that two years later, we would be penpals, not in different countries, but in different times? She wished she could consider the both of them lovers. He was good-looking, an architect, and he just seemed so...she struggled to find a word that aptly described him, but found words instead: gentle, funny, nice, charming...she could go on forever. From their brief conversation, she already knew so much about him. She felt like she had known him for her whole life. Okay, she knew Morgan loved her, he wasn't that bad actually( though in the looks factor he was just average) and it was incredibly sweet of him to organize a birthday party for her. She remembered all too well what had happened the year before. He was in Dubai at that time, and although he called back, just like any other day, he didn't mention it at all. It was only a month later when he realized and in a panicked frenzy he apologized and got her a present. She forgave him; after all, he was a busy man, but she still felt hurt sometimes. They shouldn't go it alone He wished this night would last forever. He knew this night would be his only opportunity to meet her, to hold her in his arms. It was a good thing Morgan was in the house, far away from them. The fact that Kate was dancing willingly with him had to mean her relationship with Morgan had to be strained. She had been a popular girl in school last time, friends with almost the entire school cohort, sought after by most of the guys. But after she got her degree and went out to work, she lost contact with most of her friends. Lonely was an understatement. That was why she agreed when a man in a cafe introduced himself as Morgan--she couldn't even remember the name of the cafe--and subsequently asked her out. She just didn't want to walk the tumultous path of life alone. it's not so good when you're on your own No one could live a lonely life, that was human nature, no doubt about it. Most people didn't fear death, the great dark curtain that signified the end of a performance; instead, it was the prospect of loneliness that scared them. he imagined going about his life in solitude, and shuddered involuntarily. He needed his friends, he needed his family, he neede her. She clung onto him tightly. So come to me. now we can be what we wanna be I wish, he thought bitterly. Why did fate have to be so cruel to place them two years apart?why did she even have to have a boyfriend? For a moment, she imagined what it would be like if Alex was her boyfriend. They could go for dinner together, he wouild make her laugh, maybe they would dance like this again. What did he do during his free time? Did he play tennis, golf, billiard? Did he like to watch movies? Did he have any siblings? There was so much about him that remained a mystery to her; she yearned to find out more. I love you and now I see He loved her, no doubt about it, but he daren't admit it. What if she didn't feel the same way? What if she just wanted a normal friendship?What if he was rejected? He had to be sure before telling her. He was a coward, he knew, but women, they were so unpredictable. Love. That word ha dleft her lips a long time ago and had never been uttered again. Yes, she loved Morgan in the beginning, but now she was not so sure. Once upon a time they had smiled when just looking at each other, had kissed so lovingly, every chance they had, had went out for candlelit dinners. He had even given her roses on Valentine's Day. But he was a busy man, and had to travel quite frequently. She soon found out, no matter how many calls he made, no matter how many times he reaffirmed his love for her, that distance diluted the once fiery passion between them. This is the way it should be He pulled her closer to him, knowing that when the music stopped, he would leave, and who knew when they would meet again? The song's going to end soon, she realized ruefully. she shut out her mind and enjoyed the last moments. This is the way it should be for lovers, they shouldn't go it alone, it's not so good when you're on your own I'm very sure, this never happened to me before, I met you and now I'm sure This never happened before This never happened before As the music slowly faded into nothing, she lifted her head from his shoulder, and gazed at him. he leaned slightly towards her, a little tentative. She parted her lips invitingly, her heart palpitating painfully in her chest. His warm, soft lips landed on hers and she closed her eyes, letting her senses and emotions overcome her. It was like a dream, a fantasy she wished would never end. \"Kate.\" The voice sounded far away, but she realized, with a jolt, that it belonged to Morgan. She stumbled away from Alex frantically, her body still tingling all over. \" I...was just talking to Alex about the...uh...lake house.\" she scrambled for an excuse, her face flaming, her eyes unable to meet Morgan's. Morgan stared at her unblinkingly. \"Great.\" he echoed hollowly. And just like that, it was over. Between Morgan and her, a thin film appeared, that slowly, meticulously seperated them. But what hurt her more was that Alex was gone from her life forever. For him, he couldn't meet her anymore, so her treasured that memory. That night, she had danced and kissed a random stranger (or so she thought); for him, a lover. Please review! concrit and whatever else will be appreciated , as this is my first songfic.

Of course he'd known that for a long time - four years of time. But having her right here in front of him, that made everything different. All the times he'd thought about this moment he'd imagined it would have a dreamlike quality, that he'd be always be wondering if it was real, if they were really together at last after so long. But to his surprise it wasn't like that. She was so unquestionably real, so warm against his skin, so utterly familiar. In all his time at the Lake House he'd never felt this at home. They pulled away from the kiss slowly, and Alex felt his heart skip more beats than he was sure was healthy. He'd seen her in glimpses - through a cloudy train window, in the darkness of a garden - but the clear light beside the Lake House she was breathtaking. He didn't know how he'd ever survived all those months without her. The thick, beautiful hair that framed her face, her classic features. Those eyes, there could never be any words that would ever describe the depths of those eyes of hers. They walked together down towards the Lake House, arms around one another. Not rushing, because now, ah - now they had all the time in the world. \"How did you do it?\" Kate was looking up at him, her slender fingers warm around his own. She was shaking her head slightly, hair bouncing softly. He paused, collecting his thoughts - it was difficult to do, with her standing so close. His concentration was undeniably sketchy. \"I told my brother once, that you were more real than anything I'd ever known. It... was the first time I'd said that I loved you out loud, though I'd known it in my heart for longer. That was after we stopped writing. And I remembered how it felt, to be without you.\" He saw the gleam of a team at the corner of her eyes, and gently brushed them away with his fingertips. \"It wasn't easy to wait, but knowing that there was hope, remembering how I was without your letters, and knowing however bad it was then it would be a thousand times that good if I could wait.\" She reached for him then, the smile lighting up her whole face. And as he kissed her for the third time, every barrier fell away. There were no doubts, no questions. Just him, just her, her soft lips against his, her hand pressed against his chest, his arm curving around her waist. He wasn't sure which one of them began it, though he was aware of her red coat dropping to the ground, then his jacket. She pulled the turtleneck up over his head, her blouse was unbuttoned. He wrapped her close and lifted her, walking backwards into the bedroom, where they left a further shedded trail of shoes, socks and pants that led to the bed. He awoke to the gentle drumming of rain upon the roof. The first thing he saw was Kate's sleeping face - she hadn't woken up yet. She was lying curled against his side, one arm curved over his chest, a leg edging over the side of his. It brought an instant smile to his face, but also a twinge of worry. How was he ever going to leave this woman again? Work was going to be problematic. He wondered briefly how many days holiday he could get away with before deciding he didn't care. Nothing mattered more than Kate, not now. He was a little worried about what was going to happen next, more for Kate's sake than his own. It had been a lot for her, he knew, learning about his death, coming to the Lake House to try and stop him. To her this must be happening at a lightning pace, for him - well, he'd had a long time to think about it. For now, he lay back, propping his cheek in his hand, watching her sleep. He couldn't get his fill of her, and he knew he never would, and even better than that he never had to. She stirred before she woke up, finding a pair of gentle dark eyes and a welcoming smile greeting her. Warm surprise lit up her face, and Alex thought it might be one of his favourite expressions of hers. \"Alex?\" she whispered, and there was a question in his name. \"I'm here.\" He replied, reaching out a hand and resting his palm against her cheek. The wonder on her face was incredible, sending his heart going at a pace he was certain must be audible to her. He had to smile at her, and she returned it, though when she glanced down at the covers a faint blush tinged her cheek, clearly recalling the events of the previous night. He rushed to assure her, suddenly anxious they'd crossed that line too quickly for her. \"You don't have to feel any pressure... I'm sorry if I-\" She cut him off by catching hold of the hand still alongside her face, turning the palm inwards to plant a kiss there. \"Don't be sorry. I don't have any regrets.\" she assured him, twisting slightly to plant a kiss on his cheek. He couldn't help turning towards her, catching her lips with his. \"None?\" He checked, speaking without breaking the kiss. She nodded slightly, finally pulling back and running her fingers through his ruffled hair. \"None. But what I do need is a shower.\" He couldn't let her go without another kiss first. She grinned, ducking her head a little shyly before slipping from the bed. \"Ah! Cold!\" she complained, bolting towards the bathroom. Alex grinned - he hadn't taken his eyes off her for a second. There were definitely perks, he decided, to a house with glass walls. \"Maybe the lack of clothes has something to do with that?\" He called cheekily, and heard a laugh in response. Showered, dressed and breakfasted, they sat side by side on the porch, against the wall so the rain still falling didn't drench them. Kate's head was tucked on Alex's shoulder, her hand tracing light patterns over his propped-up knee. There were few nicer sounds, Alex reflected, than the rain on the surface of the lake. \"Alex?\" Except, for possibly, that voice. \"Hmm?\" \"What do we do now? Where do we go from here?\" He turned to look at her and smiled slightly. \"Well, looks like we're stuck indoors for now. Coincidentally that's quite okay by me, I should add.\" He kissed her ear and grinned. She laughed and snuggled a little closer to him. \"I'm serious, Alex.\" He sat back a little and turned to face her. \"Okay, really. Right now, there is exactly one thing on my mind -you. I don't want to go to work, I don't want to leave the Lake House, I do not want to leave your side. And I don't want to push you into anything you're not ready for, but you should know that... I'll do this any way you want. I'll spend as much or little time here as you want me to, and you don't have to feel any pressure.\" She had been watching him quietly, letting him speak and thinking how lucky she was. All he was concerned about was her. Everything he'd gone through, all the time he'd spent waiting for her. \"Alex, you don't have to do that. It wasn't just you waiting.\" she curled her hand behind his neck and gave him a quick kiss. \"I don't want to be away from you anymore.

Logically, he knew he shouldn't, but he did. He could still feelnthe breeze from the passing bus â€“ the bus which, according tonKate's letter, should have killed him. He was alive, as alive thisnmoment as he had been a moment ago, but somehow the sunlight seemednbrighter, the unusually balmy day warmer. He opened the letternand read it again. It was you in front of that bus. Waitnfor me. I'm at the Lake House. Don't go . Her letter hadnsaved his life; her letter had nearly taken it. The hint of where ,nthat she would be in Daley Plaza that Valentine's Day, had been anlure to him, honey to a bee. He could still see her, chattingncheerful to a plump older woman. He wondered who the other womannwas. Maybe her mother. He liked that thought, that she valued hernfamily more than he had valued his, that she would take her lunchnbreak on such a lovely day to spend it with her mother in the warmnFebruary sunshine. There were no busesncoming now, but he could feel a pull in the back of his mind, anninsistent tug like an unruly child. They had changed the future . He wasn't much of a reader, but weren't there movies like that,nmovies that told what happened if you changed the course of fate? Henwas alive when he should be dead; what would happen if he went overnthere now, introduced himself to Kate, asked her out? She wouldn't go backnto the Lake House. She wouldn't find his letter, the first onenthat he had written in reply to hers. They wouldn't start theirnaching correspondence that would alternate enthrall and tease him. They might not fall in love at all. He took a step back,nshaking his head. No, she had to go to the Lake House. He hadnconfidence in the universe's ability to right itself; she would gonanyway. Maybe someone at the hospital would irritate her, maybe shenwould get a call from that odious ex of hers and she would flee. Either way, she would go. With one last look,ndrinking her in, he returned to the little office he and Henry hadnstarted. It was only two years; he could wait. Perhaps he couldnlook out for her, as well. The months went by; no,nthe months crawled by. Sometimes he would sit in the windownof the little cafÃ© across the street from her apartment at thentime she said she usually went home, watching for her little Mustangnto pull in when she returned from the Lake House. Once, he hadndriven slowly by the Lake House, watching her frantically scribbleninto a leather notebook. He remembered that day, the first day theynhad written, and the thought of watching from her side had drawn himnlike iron filings to a lodestone. He had never thought of himself asnparticularly poetically-minded, but he liked that analogy. She wasnhis lodestone, the compass to which he fixed his heart. It was two years. Hencould wait. He nearly abandoned hisnvow to wait when the day they had agreed to meet at the restaurantnarrived. He sat on a bench across the street from Il Mare, one handnclutching the back like a lifeline as he twisted to watch thenentrance, the one holding tightly to a bouquet of roses. They werendark red, and the smell rose around him in the night like fragrantnghosts. There. Kate steppednout of her dark orange Mustang, radiant in a beaded black dress. Shenwas perfect; lovely. She entered the restaurant, her shouldersnsquared confidently; happy to be one of the few who would be allowednpast the revered portal â€“ one of the few with a reservation madentwo years before. He watched the hostess greet her with a smile andndawning recognition, the holder of a mysterious reservation made twonyears before. They disappeared into the bowels of the restaurant andnhe half-rose, gripped by the urge to go with her, to meet as they hadnpromised. Luckily, his handngripped the roses quite as strongly as the urge gripped him. Thenflorist had been lax, and a thorn dug into his palm, distracting him. With a hiss of pain, he glanced down at the single drop of bloodnwelling in his palm. The sight of blood sobered him and cleared hisnmind; she didn't think she loved him yet, not really. It was thenseparation that caused that, and with the separation came the letternthat would save his life. That night, he drove tonthe Lake House and put one of the roses in the mailbox, along with anletter of instruction. As he did it, the knowledge of what he didnthat night blossomed in his mind; he had pressed it between the pagesnof Persuasion , wrapped the whole in layers of plastic, and putnit under one of the floorboards of Kate's yet-unfinished apartment. It was two years. Hencould wait. Alex avoided her thenrest of that year. He didn't want to see her get back togethernwith Morgan, her odious no-longer-ex. He threw himself into hisnwork, all the while aware of two timelines still in his mind. Hencould feel the one where his life ended abruptly, the sense of itngrowing more urgent as Valentine's Day drew nearer. If Kate didn'tnwarn him, would he still die in front of the bus? Would the him that was here vanish like a soap bubble? But she had to feel itntoo; it was like there were two different realities in his mind. Henknew what he had to do, and on February 14 of 2008, the date on thentattered, much-folded letter he still carried, he took his brothernHenry aside as the office opened, before Kate and Morgan, their firstnclients of the day, arrived. \"She's going to asknabout me,\" he told Henry in a whisper, glancing at the rest of thenstaff. \"Who?\" Henry'snface creased in surprise, glancing around as well. \"Kate. Our client. She's Kate .\" He nodded at the dawning understanding onnHenry's face. \"She can't know I'm alive. You have to tellnher I died in front of Daley Plaza two years ago today. I was hit byna bus.\" \"What? Butâ€¦ younweren't. I mean, no one died in front of Daley Plaza two years agontoday. She'll know it's a lie.\" Henry frowned, a creasenappearing between his eyes. \"No she won't,nbecause she'll have the memory of it. I remember it, the feelingnof being hit, the blackness, but I also remember not beingnhit. She has to think I died two years ago, or I will. Do you see?\" Henry looked completelynconfused, and Alex didn't blame him. He was confused as well, butnhe knew this was how it had to be. \"No. But I'll do what younask. Who should I take it with me for the consultation, then?\" They settled onnVanessa, who could be trusted with this sort of fabrication. Shenread romance novels, Henry told her; she would think the whole thingnterribly romantic and would play along. Alex hid in the closetnnext to their little conference room, the one with the thin wallnadjacent to the conference room that had been necessary to isolatenthe room from the sounds of the lobby. He could hear every word thatnwas said; the exclamations of happiness over their design, thenback-and-forth between Henry and Kate over minor changes. Morgan, hennoticed, was silent, as though this idea was all Kate's, and he hadnno opinions at all. He heard the ritualnwords of farewell as Kate and Morgan, happy with the design, got upnto leave. He heard the pause as she saw his drawing of the LakenHouse. Her question to his brother â€“ who drew that? â€“nHenry's answer that Alex, his brother, had drawn it. Where cannI find him? Kate asked â€“ Henry, sounding nervous and not nearlynsad enough, responding that, I'm sorry, he passed away two yearsnago today. Where? Asked Kate, sounding shocked, tearsnclogging her throat. Alex swallowed, feeling guilty and excited allnat once. Guilty â€“ he was causing her pain, lying to her like this. Excited â€“ it was two years today. Two years . He couldnhold her soon, he could feel the anticipation building. Daley Plaza, Henry toldnher. He was hit by a bus. A moment of shocked silence, and thennclatter of heels as Kate dashed out of the office, Morgan following anmoment later, shouting questions. Alex waited, counting heartbeats,nand then opened the door. Henry was waiting for him, looking evennmore puzzled than before. \"She didn't evennlook surprised. It was like she remembered the same thing you do,nthat bus accident that never happened.\" Shaking his head, Henryndismissed the whole business as strange before giving his big brotherna broad grin. \"Well, it's about time. Go get her, would you?\" Alex didn't wait anmoment longer. He sprinted down the stairs to where he had left hisntruck, hidden around the side of the building, and headed for thenLake House, his heart in his throat. Wait for me. I'm at thenLake House. She was waiting for him at the Lake House. It had been two years. He wouldn't have to wait any longer. ","Summary":" Alex felt different Alex felt different.

The attractionnbetween them was undeniable and she found herself in his arms fasternthan she could have imagined. \"You waited,\" shenwhispered. Withoutnsaying a word, he kissed her. This wasn't just any ordinary kiss,nit was two years full of waiting, two years of longing, and most ofnall, it was a kiss fueled by love.

It felt like a warm bath on a freezing cold day or the bestnpiece of chocolate cake you've ever eaten when all you've beennwanting is chocolate for two years. It was as if they fit together,nperfectly. He kissed her, and kissed her, and hated the idea ofnstopping. He'd finally made it back to her and he never wanted tonlet go.

I wanted to share everything with you.\" \"Theynare beautiful. I can't wait to read them,\" she smiled through herntears. \"You don't have to.\" He replied.

Shernhad had a traumatic day in many ways, and even though things werernfinally all right, he knew all too well how it could have gone.

The hardestrnbecause there had been days when he had wanted to seek her out sornbadly he couldn't stand it, and the easiest because he had known thatrneverything would be worth it in the end.

She alwaysrnheld back, kept things to herself and worried about what tomorrow would bring.rnThese were not true love. True love had found Kate Wyler in the form of an old mailbox,rna gorgeous lake house and a precocious dog named, Jack. Then it all happened. The letters, the sadness, thernuncertainness. He made it to that mailbox, when she feared he would not orrncould not. He never left her, even though he had two years to do so. Alex Wylerrnwas a loving soul and he felt for her what she felt for him. He opened her uprnto more things than she ever knew existed and unlocked something inside of herrnthat no man could ever have. She set his mind racing, enchanting her with everyrnmoment of intimate interaction. Now, it was more than letters.

Where is she?\" \"Calm down, sir,\" the desk nurse responded. \"What is your wife's name?\" He ran his hands through his hair and exhaled loudly. \"Angela Trelawney. The news report said she was here. I need to see her. Is she all right?\" She looked at him cautiously, then glanced down at the phone. \"Hold on, sir. You'll need to speak to the officer in charge.\" She pressed a button and spoke quietly into the receiver, keeping her eyes on the 40-ish man dressed head to toe in J. Crew. He paced nervously until a large-bellied plainclothesman with a cheap tie and a service pin approached. The detective held out his hand. \"I'm Lieutenant Wise. Can I help you, sir?\" Trelawney took his hand and pumped it earnestly, sincere worry oozing from every pore. \"Yes, please, Lieutenant. My name is Sean Trelawney, my wife Angela is here.\" Wise motioned to the nurses' break room to the left of the charge desk. \"Why don't we step in here, sir?\" Trelawney followed him into the brightly lit room and sat opposite the aging officer at a round, Formica-topped table. Faxed slogans like \"It's hard to fly with the eagles when you're surrounded by turkeys\" were taped to the walls, in between OSHA and EEOC posters. The fluorescents gleamed off the bright pink scalp of the cop, whose thinning white hair stuck straight up in a military burr. \"Now,\" said Wise, \"what makes you think your wife is here?\" \"They showed her picture on TV, they said she was injured. I drove straight down from Seattle as soon as I heard.\" \"What was your wife doing down here all by herself, Mr. Trelawney?\" \"Hiking. She's a programmer, and she likes to get away by herself a couple times a month.\" \"Where does she work?\" \"Copper Canyon Technologies. It's an IT - information technologies company. Look, can I see my wife, please?\" Wise settled his rump back in the plastic seat, which creaked in protest. \"Well sir,\" he said, \"you have to understand my position. I can't just hand her over to any ya-hoo who walks in off the street. Do you have some proof of who you are, and your wife's identity as well?\" Trelawney looked confused for a moment, then began patting his jacket and pants. \"Well, I don't have Angela's ID, she had that with her.\" He pulled out his wallet and flipped through it. \"But here's my driver's license, and my work security pass. Oh, wait - - here's our wedding picture.\" He pulled out the two-by-four color glossy and handed it to Wise. A smiling Angela in white dress and veil stood close in a three-quarter shot to a tuxedoed Trelawney. 'Kelly is going to get a bonus for this one,' he thought with an inward smirk. Wise studied the photo briefly, then looked up with a smile. \"You can't much beat that, can you? If you don't mind, though, I'd like to call your company, just to provide a little extra verification.\" Trelawney pulled out a business card. \"The number's at the bottom. Ask for Don Smith. He supervises both of us.\" \"Husband and wife team, huh?\" Trelawney smiled, concern for his injured wife tightening the corners of his mouth. In five minutes, Wise returned to take him to Angela. She looked better than he thought she would. The doctor explained that she'd suffered a concussion in the fall, which had resulted in partial amnesia. Her memory would most likely return in a few weeks, although she might never recall the accident itself. Trelawney cautiously approached her bedside, and was relieved to see a complete lack of recognition in her eyes. He bent down over her and gently brushed her bangs away from her face. \"Angela, honey,\" he whispered, \"I've come to take you home.\" She blinked, her eyes traveling from him, to Wise, to the doctor, and back again. \"Who are you?\" \"I'm Sean, honey. I'm your husband. Don't worry, the doctor says you'll remember everything in a day or two. We can go home now.\" \"I want her to follow up with a neurologist. I'll give you a couple of names on the way out,\" the doctor said, then left the happy couple, plus Wise, to themselves. Angela looked to the portly detective for assistance. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Trelawney. I checked everything out. You'll be okay. I'm sure your husband will take good care of you.\" Trelawney turned and shook the detective's hand. \"Thank you for all your help, Lieutenant.\" As he left, Angela shifted in her bed, moving slightly away from her husband. \"I don't understand,\" she said. \"If we're married, where's my wedding ring?\" He smiled. \"Right where you left it, on the kitchen counter.\" He sat down on the edge of the bed and she scooted even further away. He covered her hand with his, his eyes warm with understanding. \"Don't worry, Angela. I know you don't remember me, but the memories will come back. Until then, I'm not going to pressure you. I -\" he looked down at the hand cradled in his own. \"I love you, Angela.\" She remained silent, unsure what to say. He stood up and picked up an overnight bag. \"I brought some of your things from home.\" He looked around awkwardly. \"I'll just wait outside until you get dressed.\" Standing outside the hospital door, he had to congratulate himself on his performance. He'd hit every nuance of the loving, concerned husband just right.[Chapter 2] They stopped for dinner at a cliffside restaurant that overlooked the sea. Candles flickered at each table, their glow supplemented by muted track lighting around the walls. The Wynton Marsalis Quintet played on the sound system, muting the sound of the surf far below. The hostess seated them, and Trelawney studied Angela's face as she gazed at the stormy ocean. He wanted her. He wouldn't lie to himself about that. If he'd ever had the chance before, he would've taken her. But this would be much more satisfying. She wouldn't fight, true, but she wouldn't run away either. She looked back at him, her brown eyes wary and confused. He was so caught up in his fantasies that he forgot his lines. All he could do was smile at her. That seemed to be all she need though, as she smiled in return. \"You do look familiar to me,\" she said. \"And my name sounds familiar. I just can't remember anything. What am I like? What kind of person am I?\" His smile widened. \"Well, you're beautiful, obviously.\" She blushed. \"But you're also smart - brilliant, in fact. You're determined and honest, loyal, idealistic. You're a good person, Angela Trelawney.\" She looked down at her place setting, composing herself before she continued. \"How long have we been married?\" \"A year. Here, let me show you our wedding picture. Maybe that'll trigger some memories.\" He pulled the photo out and handed it over, watching her face as she studied the image. She looked up. \"Do - do you mind if I keep this?\" He shook his head. \"Do we have children?\" \"Not yet. We were, ah, going to start working on that this year.\" \"Oh.\" To her great relief, the waiter arrived to take their orders. Her gaze returned to the whitecaps far below. She knew she had fallen into a ravine in the woods, because the nurses had told her that. She knew that she had apparently been hiking alone, because the police had told her that. And she knew what Sean had told her. Funny. It seemed strange to think of him as \"Sean,\" and not \"Trelawney.\" But why? It was some comfort, at least, to find something familiar. \"Would you like to dance?\" She looked up to find him standing beside her, a hand held out. In her confusion, she acceded, although she didn't really want to. She wasn't sure she knew how to dance. Trelawney led her to the small area in the center of the room where two or three couples were dancing cheek to cheek. Shirley Bassey's smoky voice sang as Trelawney pulled her into his arms. His chin rested against her hair, and as they danced, he let his lips drift down to place a soft kiss on her forehead. \"I was frantic when I heard about your accident. The thought of losing you forever . . \" he hugged her tighter. \"I just couldn't bear it, Angela.\" He sighed. \"You're everything to me.\" She relaxed into his arms. She felt so safe there. She closed her eyes and savored the sensation. Safety. Rest. It seemed like eons since she had last experienced them. Suddenly, the face of a young blond man flashed into her mind. It was just a second, and then it was gone. Her body tensed again. \"What's the matter?\" She shook her head. \"Nothing.\" The song ended and they returned to their table. She raised her eyes to his. \"Sean, was I attacked?\" His hand, reaching for his wineglass, froze. He blinked. \"No. Not as far as I know. Why? Do you remember something?\" \"No.\" She hesitated. \"It's just that when we were dancing, I felt so safe . . Trelawney smiled and squeezed her hand. \"And then I got this memory, or an image, or something . . . of this guy. And suddenly, I felt afraid.\" Trelawney's brow furrowed. \"What did he look like?\" Angela smiled and shook her head. \"That's what's funny. He looked like a surfer.\" He grinned. \"Probably one of the hikers who rescued you. You had a pretty good fall, you know. All the images and emotions are just getting jumbled up.\" She visibly relaxed. \"You're probably right. Sean,\" she said, \"thank you.\" \"For what?\" \"For taking care of me.\" \"I love you, Angela. I'll always watch over you.\"[Chapter 3] Jacob was on his way to the hospital when the news broke over his Walkman. The injured hiker had been identified and returned to her family. When the new jockey gave her name as \"Angela Trelawney,\" he went one way and his board went the other. \"Nice move, dude!\" a couple of passing teen queens hooted. He picked himself up and raced back to his room at the inn. Setting up his notepad, he quickly hacked into the hospital computers. \"Angela Trelawney. Spouse: Sean Trelawney. Address: 181 Ventura Street, Seattle.\" 'Why would they pull something like this when they could just have her arrested again?' Jacob wondered. He dialed the number listed in her hospital records, fully expecting to be politely informed that the number was either disconnected or wrong. What he got was Trelawney's voice on an answering machine. Jacob held the receiver at arm's length and stared at it, slack-jawed. \"What the hell?\" he whispered. Angela had to admit, it was a pretty house. The prairie-style home spread out across the hilly landscape, half a mile off the road. Discreetly placed lights had illumined the drive and house upon their approach, accenting the perfect geometric angles of the architecture in relation to the undulating curves of the Washington countryside. Trelawney put the Range Rover in park and hopped out to open the door for his wife. He held her hand as they climbed the stone steps to the entrance, where he whooshed a laughing Angela off her feet and over the threshold. \"What are you doing?!\" \"Making a memory,\" he said with a smile. He carried her into the living room and set her down. \"You don't remember the first time I did this, so I thought I'd refresh your recollection.\" His arms were still around her and she found herself staring into his hazel eyes. In the sudden silence, he leaned in for a kiss. When she returned it, he clasped her tighter, and her arms wrapped around him. She pulled away. \"I - I'm sorry. I'm not ready yet.\" He cleared his throat. \"I understand.\" \"Um. I'm going to take a bath.\" He turned away. \"Okay.\" \"Um?\" He looked over his shoulder. \"Where's the bathroom?\" \"Oh. It's off our room. Top of the stairs, bathroom's on the left, next to the fireplace.\" \"Thanks.\" He watched her retreat up the staircase. He figured one hundred push-ups ought to take care of it. Angela emerged from the bathroom wearing a berry-colored silk chemise. As it so happened, Trelawney had made sure that all of her sleepwear came from Victoria's Secret. There were no flannel pyjamas to be found in the house. He was already between the sheets and had a fire going in the fireplace. She padded over to the opposite side of the queen-sized bed and slipped under the covers. She closed her eyes, and a small sigh escaped her. \"Tired?\" he asked. \"No. It's just good to be home.\" He lay down on his side, facing her, one arm under his head. \"I feel like I haven't been home in ages, you know?\" she continued. \"Mm-hmm.\" He reached out and her eyes flew open. \"No, I just want to hold you,\" he assured her. He inched forward and pulled her gently into his arms. Within five minutes, she was asleep.[Chapter 4] She was lying on her back in the sand, staring up into a gray sky. She could hear the roll of the surf nearby, and the seagulls calling to each other. The blond guy sat beside her. He was smiling down at her, and she didn't feel the least bit afraid of him. Instead, she felt like she was home. She longed to reach up and touch his face, but something held her still. She wanted to tell him to pull her into his arms, but when she spoke, no sound came out. She began crying and was awakened by her loneliness, to find herself cradled in her husband's arms. He seemed like a good man. He seemed to love her. She was grateful for that. But as she studied his face as he slept - trying to tell herself that this was her husband, the man she loved - the face of the blond man kept insinuating itself in her memory. She rested her head on her husband's chest. Who was the blond? What role did he play in her life? She considered getting up and searching the house for some clue to his identity, but fell asleep again before moving a centimeter. ****************************** \"Angela?\" Jacob looked around the dimly lit motel room, an exercise which took him a total of two seconds. He remembered where he was, and sat up in bed. Reaching down, he pulled the Seattle street map onto the bed and flicked on the lamp. With his finger, he traced the route from the motel room to Ventura Street. He wondered if he could just waltz in and get her. Somehow, he doubted it. Trelawney was likely to have an electrified fence, pitbulls, and all manner of security devices around his house. Even assuming he could get in, there was no guarantee Angela would come with him, unless she remembered. He had to make her remember. If only there was some way to get an e-mail to her. The Sorcerer's voice would surely trigger her memory, enough to get her to meet him somewhere. But all this speculation was moot, because there was no way to get an e-mail to her without Trelawney intercepting it. Face to face was his only hope. He hopped into the shower, hoping to make himself presentable. He wondered if she believed Trelawney, believed she was his wife. If so, she might be lost forever. Jacob rested his forehead against the cool white tile, letting the hot water trickle over his skin. He had never really stopped to think how important Angela was to him, but she was. She was his touchstone. What would become of him without her in his life? That was why he'd sent her that first e-mail, the one that turned her life upside down. He'd wanted an ally, yes, but more than that, he'd wanted a friend. He'd been dreaming, before he awoke; dreaming of Angela. They were lying on the bed together, on their sides, facing each other and talking over the day's events like they'd gotten into the habit of doing. She was saying something, and laughing, when she'd started to fade away. He reached out and managed to caress her lips before she disappeared altogether. As he stood in the shower, he imagined her arms wrapping around him, her head resting against his back. With a groan, he wiped the water off his face and shut the tap off. Daydreaming wasn't going to bring her back. It was time to get to work. ****************************** \"You see? I told you.\" Angela looked up from her cereal to see her husband holding aloft a small gold wedding band. \"Right where you left it.\" He walked towards her from he kitchen sink, and pulled her hand to him. \"Let me do the honors,\" he said. \"Again.\" He slipped the ring onto her finger and sat down next to her, one arm across her shoulders. \"Do you feel up to getting out today?\" he asked. She sipped her grapefruit juice before answering. \"What did you have in mind?\" \"I thought we could ride up to the Farmer's Market, do a little shopping, and have lunch together.\" \"Don't you have to go to work?\" \"No,\" he said too quickly. \"Mr. Smith has given us some time off until you get back on your feet.\" \"Us? You mean, we work together?\" Trelawney took a sip of his coffee, averting his eyes in the process. He set it down gently on the mission table before answering. \"Yes. We work for Copper Canyon Technologies. You're a computer programmer.\" \"Copper Canyon . . . \" Angela stared unseeing through the floor-to-ceiling window that comprised one entire wall of the kitchen. The rolling hills were lush with greenery, from the rich kelly of the weedless lawn to the green-black of the ancient firs that skirted the yard. None of it registered with Angela, who saw only a desert landscape. \"I work with computers . . . at Copper Canyon.\" It was part statement, part question. Her husband smiled nervously. \"Yes. You're one of the top employees.\" She faced him again. \"And you're a programmer too?\" \"No, I'm just in administration. They leave all the brain work to geniuses like you,\" he said, chucking her under the chin with a wink. When she didn't reply, but continued to stare blankly into space, he added, \"So, do you want to come into town with me? I'm planning a special dinner for us tonight, and I thought you could help me pick out the ingredients.\" He paused. \"And, well, I just want to spend some time with you, Angela. I know it makes you uncomfortable to be alone with me right now, and I'm trying really hard not to pressure you.\" He looked down at her hand cradled in his. He pressed it to his lips before staring soulfully into her eyes. \"But I miss you, Angela. I miss you so much.\" She melted at the sight of the tears welling up in his eyes, and pulled him into her embrace. \"I'm sorry.\" She buried her face in his shoulder. \"I know this is difficult for you, and I know you're being patient, and I love you for it.\" Trelawney smiled. \"Of course I'll go with you. Just give me an hour to shower and get dressed, okay?\" He nodded, bravely holding back his tears. She gave him a quick kiss, then headed upstairs. Trelawney pulled her bowl of cereal over and finished it.[Chapter 5] They were wandering through Farmer's Market when Angela saw him - the blond guy. He was standing across the street, in the doorway of a coffee house, looking straight at her. Sean was several booths up, mulling over a collection of mangoes and star fruit. She glanced his way once, then took out across the street. The blond guy turned out of the doorway and around the corner, heading up Pike Street towards Century Square. She jogged across the road and followed him. He looked over his shoulder, then picked up the pace. She pursued, until they were both running full out. He zipped around a corner and she dogged him. She took the 90-degree turn into an alley way, and found herself face-to-face with the man who had been haunting her. Only now did she realize the danger she had placed herself in. She considered backing up, running back to Sean, but the need to know, to solve this mystery, overwhelmed any other considerations. Before she could demand answers, he said softly, \"Hello, Angel.\" Something melted inside her at the sound of his voice. She wasn't afraid, not now. She remembered her dream of last night, the closeness she had felt with him, the warmth. \"Who are you?\" she whispered. \"I'm Jacob, remember? Sorcerer.\" \"Sorcerer? What does that mean? How do I know you?\" She paused, scanning his face. Her voice lowered. \"Are we lovers?\" Jacob's blush began at his collar and worked its way up to the roots of his hair. He swallowed hard, and looked away for a second before answering, \"No. No, we're not lovers.\" He laughed. \"Not that you don't keep trying, though.\" In spite of herself, Angela smiled. \"Then who are you?\" \"I'm your friend. You're in danger. Don't you remember? Think back to what you were doing in California.\" \"I was hiking. I needed some time off from work.\" \"Work? Is that what he told you?\" he demanded. \"What who told me?\" she asked suspiciously. \"Trelawney,\" he spat. She edged away. \"I lost my memory. My husband has had to fill in a few details for me . . .\" \"Husband!\" Jacob knew that was the story Trelawney had fed the authorities, but he somehow never completely believed that Angela would fall for it, not the way she felt about Trelawney. Unbidden, an image of Angela in the smarmy Trelawney's embrace imprinted itself in his mind, and a jolt of what he would later refuse to admit was jealousy surged through him. It was apparent to Angela, though. Jacob grabbed her arms. \"You haven't slept with him, have you?\" She struggled to escape, finally jerking herself free. \"Leave me alone! Stay away from me, whoever you are.\" She turned and ran. He went after her. \"Angel, wait!\" Passersby stared, and a couple of beefy guys blocked his path. \"Are you bothering that lady?\" Behemoth Number One said to him. \"No, we were just having a little lover's quarrel.\" Jacob tried to move past him, but Behemoth Number Two pulled him back. \"Well, it looks like you both need a time-out. Why don't you leave the little lady alone.\" It was an order, not a question, and the question would have been moot anyway. Angela had disappeared back into the depths of the market. 'Reunited with her loving husband, no doubt,' Jacob thought grimly. - \"Where'd you go?\" Sean put his arm around her shoulder and pulled her close. She was still slightly out of breath, her face a little flushed from the sprint back. He frowned. \"What happened?\" Without conscious thought, she lied. \"Oh, I went across the road to see what they had at the coffee shop. I had a near miss with a cyclist on the way back.\" She smiled convincingly. He grinned. \"Your accident karma is piling up this week. You'd better stay close to me from now on.\" He gave her a quick, unexpected, open-mouthed kiss, then led her onward towards the fish market. Angela's head was reeling from her physical response to his casual kiss, as well as the emotional storm of the confrontation with Jacob. She pushed her thoughts of the young blond man - whoever he was - away, wrapped her arm around her husband's waist, and concentrated on the array of seafood before them. As they strolled through the market, Sean's hand continually rubbed her shoulder, her neck, her back, and once or twice settled for a brief caress on her hips. With each touch, she found her thoughts of Jacob fading, and longed to be at home where she was safe. With her husband. But that word brought to mind Jacob's jealous accusation, and a niggle of doubt prodded her consciousness. Why would Sean say he was her husband if he wasn't? Well, okay, there was a rational answer to that one. But what about the wedding photo? You couldn't argue that away. She reached down to her purse and longed to pull her wallet out, to examine the photo, to reassure herself that reality was what she thought it to be. She couldn't do that though, not in front of Sean. \"Tell me about our wedding,\" she asked suddenly. \"What?\" \"Our wedding. What was it like?\" \"Hmm,\" he looked up to the timbered rooftop for inspiration. \"Well, you were radiant, of course. I was devilishly handsome.\" They both grinned. \"My best man - do you remember Jimmy?\" She shook her head. \"Well, at the reception, Jimmy got absolutely trashed, said something obnoxious to the minister, and then mooned him.\" Angela shrieked with laughter, and he continued with his reminiscences. \"Let's see. The prime rib was overdone, and I had to physically restrain you from punching out the caterer.\" \"No way!\" She laughed. \"Absolutely! My hand to God, Angela. Of course, you were a little tipsy yourself by then.\" She smiled and shook her head. \"What song did we dance to?\" \"All of Me.\" \"Hmmm.\" She frowned. \"Nope, means nothing to me.\" \"Oh, come on, you remember.\" He took her in his arms and danced her around in the aisle. \"'All of me! Why not take all of me? Can't you see, I'm just no good without you.'\" His voice was awful, and they both cracked up at the sight of other shoppers staring in wonder at the pair of weirdos fox-trotting in the squid section. She punched his arm playfully. \"Stop it! Come on, just buy the stupid fish and let's go home.\" He halted, looked at her and smiled. \"What?\" she asked. \"Nothing. I just like the way you said that.\" He held her gaze moment. \"You're right. It's time for us to go home, Mrs. Trelawney.\"[Chapter 6] \"What progress are you making, Mr. Trelawney?\" Trelawney shut the door of the study. He could hear Angela moving about in the kitchen, putting the groceries away, but he wanted to make sure she didn't overhear any of this conversation. \"She's being drawn in, Mr. White. I expect she'll be ready to join the Guard within two weeks.\" There was silence on the other end of the line. Silence, then, \"Two weeks is a long time, Mr. Trelawney. Even for a honeymoon. Is that what this is?\" Trelawney wheeled around in his desk chair, straightening the framed wedding photograph on the right-hand corner of the oaken mission table, then neatly ordering his pen, his paper and his laptop computer. \"No, sir,\" he said evenly. \"But you must understand, this is a delicate operation. The Guard, as you know, is accustomed to scorched earth tactics, but this is a heart-and-mind war. We need to win her over to our side, and convince her that our mission is hers. With Angela Bennett as our ally, we are far stronger.\" \"Stronger than if she were dead?\" his boss asked. Trelawney's heart thudded in his chest. \"Yes,\" he answered. White paused. \"Good enough, Mr. Trelawney. Two weeks. If she hasn't come aboard by then, you kill her. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, sir. I agree completely.\" He ended the connection, then sat there, staring into space. It was a full 60 seconds before he was able to breathe again. His eyes focused on their wedding picture, and he smiled. That was a good story he'd come up with about \"Jimmy,\" the drunken best man. It was exactly what she needed to hear, exactly what she'd expect her husband to remember, rather than details about the colors of the dresses, and what type of flowers she'd carried. He picked up the photo and stared at it, smiling. Angela opened the door and peeked in. \"Can I come in?\" His smile broadened, and she entered, crossing to where he sat. \"What are you looking at?\" Then she saw it. \"Just reminiscing some more,\" he said. He pulled her down onto his lap and caressed a strand of hair that fell across her cheek. His hand trailed down her arm, coming to rest on her thigh. He could see the pulse jump in her neck, the sudden flush on her skin. \"Groceries all put away?\" he murmured. \"Mm-hmm.\" She settled against him, one arm around his shoulders. \"Who was that on the phone?\" \"Our boss. He's getting anxious to have you back already, but don't worry. I told him you need at least two weeks.\" She sighed. \"Well, that's good, since I don't remember what I do anyway.\" She fingered the laptop computer on his desk, flipping it open. \"You say I'm a programmer?\" \"Yes.\" He closed the laptop. \"But not now, you're not.\" He caressed her face, and their mouths met. Angela's toes curled inside her running shoes, every nerve ending in her body alive to his touch. Jacob never entered her mind. - Jacob had already been and gone. He took the opportunity while \"the Trelawneys\" were shopping to reconnoiter their place in the Seattle suburbs. The rich Seattle suburbs. It was the type of community where Microsoft upper management racewalked in the evening with their significant others before retiring to the hot tub for a glass of wine and some moderately illegal activity. What Jacob Resh accomplished in that community, however, was highly illegal activity. He disarmed the Trelawney alarm system and took the opportunity, while the happy couple was out, to hook up a wiretap to the phone and modem lines. He also programmed into the alarm system an alternate password, to allow himself free reign of the household without being burdened by all that bothersome, felonious hardware. One thing he wasn't blessed with, however, was inconspicuousness. He would have loved to have been staked out down the block in his car, but rich folks seem to be suspicious of bleached-blond teenage boys in Rent-a-Wrecks, especially when said boys are parked in front of the rich folks' homes for hours on end. As such, he reluctantly cruised back to the motel room, and set up shop farther than he would've liked. As he waited, and listened, and waited, he worried about Angela. Brooded about her. And his stomach churned when he thought of her with Trelawney. Had he pushed her into Trelawney's arms this afternoon? He was stupid, stupid, stupid for reacting so strongly. He should have known better. She had amnesia, she thought she was alone in the world. Of course she was going to cling to the one person who seemed to know her, who seemed to offer her safety. And what had he, Jacob, offered her? A jealous tantrum. No, not jealous, he corrected. Concerned. That's it, concerned. He cared about Angela. He just wanted to protect her, that's all. 'I mean,' he thought, 'it's not like we're in love or anything.' No, of course not. Sure, he flirted with her, but it was just a game. Right? But if she had ever said yes - what then? Jacob sighed and slumped in the worn, faded easy chair. 'In a heartbeat,' he thought. 'One single heartbeat.' His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the phone ringing. Not his phone, Trelawney's. Jacob switched on the recorder and slipped the headphones onto his ears. Fire and ice battled inside him as he listened, the ice of fear at what Mr. White had planned for Angela, either way. The fire came from what he knew Trelawney's plans were. He had made those intentions quite clear. The conversation ended, and Jacob switched off the recorder. That was it. That was how he got Angela back. Just play the tape for her. He'd break in tonight, lure her away from Trelawney, and let her listen for herself. And as a backup, he'd bring a tape of 'the Sorcerer.' That suave English accent would win her over, surely. If only he could sound like that in real life. ","Summary":" \"My wife,\" he asked breathlessly. \"I need to see my wife.

She was delicate, my wife, delicate like glass. That was why I built her a glass house. It reflected her. Still, she never really saw the adoration behind the project. She simply scoffed and went off with the children. Deep down, I was hurt. The Lake House wasn't meant to be my crowning achievement- the perfect home for my wife and family. In the end, it turned out that it wasn't. The scenic woods surrounding the Lake House were her secret hide-away. Once I went looking for her there and found her wrapped up in a sort of fantasy. It wasn't immediately apparent, but as she gazed out from the rock were she was sitting; one could see her eyes dancing. For a moment I watched her. I hadn't seen her happy in at least a year. I whispered her name, and she snapped out of whatever beautiful daydream she was having. She snapped at me, and I retreated back to the Lake House and my study. From that moment onward, I totally immersed myself in my work, not wanting to see the pain or anger that her eyes betrayed so often now. She became like shattered glass. My sons felt the repercussions the most, especially Alex. Eventually, no longer wanted to be in my presence. Then one day, she left. She mustered up all the courage that resided in her petite body and left. In my wildest dreams, I never thought that my wife would ever leave me. By now, I am certain that she's rebuilt herself and probably made herself stronger. She probably has had other loves and other beautiful houses. I hope, though, that she never forgets me and her glass house. A/N: Please R&R;! There will be a companion fic, in Alex's mother's POV coming soon.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own Lake House. A/N: Just for your information, this chapter is set just a little bit before Alex buys the Lake House. Mother's POV The dried leaves crackle under my feet as I step out of the car. It's been so long since I've been here. The place looks so weathered now, the flower boxes that hang have broken. Once upon a time my ex-husband made those beautiful flower boxes. The glass structure glares back at me. It seems to taunt me. You foolish woman! The Lake House cries. You gave up so much happiness! \"I didn't know! The eyes of my heart were shut!\" I shout at the house in return. I'm glad that the Lake House is located in such a remote area, or people would've thought that I belonged in a straightjacket. Perhaps I did. I had never been the same since the last time I walked out the Lake House's door. When I first met him, I was young, still in high school. He had a few years on me- he was in his first year of college then. We became good friends, and, one night, as I sat there, admiring his architecture sketchbook, he leaned over and kissed me. And then I kissed him back. My parents strongly disapproved of me dating a boy more than a year older than me, so I tried to forget him, although I never succeeded entirely. A few years later, I was standing in the concession stand at the movies with my then-boyfriend when a man accidentally bumped into me. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. \"It's fine,\" I rejoined, lifting my head. I froze. It was him. As in any good romance, the fire of our old love was rekindled and it all led to marriage. In the beginning our marriage was ideal and wonderful. I gave birth to two sons- Harry and Alex. They brought so much joy into our life, or at least to mine. When not caring for the boys, I would sit by his side as he designed new buildings. He always said that I was his inspiration. Apparently, he didn't always need me by his side for inspiration. He locked himself away in his study and sketched and sketched and sketched all day and through the night. One day he announced that he was building a house for us on the nearby lake. His \"crowning achievement\", he called it. He told me that the house was to be an attempt at capturing my spirit in a piece of architecture. I snapped at him, asking him how he could possibly know me. I stormed out of the room and left him to his own thoughts. When he moved Alex, Harry, and I into the house, I was shocked at the main construction material used- glass. \"A glass house!\" I had cried. \"Why did you build a glass house?\" \"Because you are like glass,\" he replied. I decided that one day I would prove him wrong. Even in my quest to become less like glass, my idealistic side won me over for at least an hour every day. Often, I would sit in the woods surrounding the Lake House and loose myself in my past memories of my husband. The first time we met, our reunion, in the first few years of our marriage were replayed like a movie in my head over and over again. I must've looked half dead to anyone who would've seen me. Finally, the day came when I proved my husband that I wasn't like glass. On that day, before the sun had even risen, I walked out off the Lake House for the final time, leaving him and the children alone. Heaven knows how he felt when he woke to find me not at his side. The years went on, and I wandered about the country, not sure where I belonged. I went to modern metropolises such as New York and Los Angeles as well as beautiful, old cities steeped in history such as Boston and Savannah. Once, I came close to marriage, but I broke the engagement out of fear. Now I suppose I've come full circle, for I find myself back at the Lake House. Perhaps I am like glass.

Fun not profit Owen stares aimlessly out of the window in his hotel room, his father is taking some calls from work again, no doubt flying off tonight...huge surprise there. Abandoning Owen again. It was what he was best at. He couldn't even give Owen one night. Just one night of being a father, or pretending to be. It didn't really matter anyway. After all that Owen Matthews had been through recently he was beyond caring. Although not even that was true... His head was a mess. A fuzzy,tangled web of lies and paranoia. \"Wonder who is to blame for that\" Owen whispers to the empty room. Looking around he sighs and walks tiredly over to the bed. He slumps down into it and shuts his eyes for a brief moment. His eyes flash open. Just as he thought...no sleep for him tonight. And perhaps a lot of nights yet to come. He was blaming himself for everything that went on. He knew logically it was Dodger that was to blame, she was the one who had set this whole game up. Game. She was still in his mind, still manipulating his thoughts. \"Damn hormones.\" He half laughs. But what if it was something more? He felt a connection with Dodger. Or at least what he thought was a connection. And he could swear that it wasn't entirely one sided. But maybe she was still just playing mind games with him. Maybe it was all part of her well thought out fabricated little plan. The same plan that was allowing her to get away with murder...literally. Everything had fallen into place exactly how she wanted it to. Her last words still resonated through his head: \"Even if that were true...Who would believe you?\" He had to stop thinking about her or he would drive himself insane. She is a killer. Then again so was he, accidental or not. Heartless. How heartless did you have to be to pull a trigger. A Manipulator. He set the game up as much as she had. A ..Wolf. With that last thought Owen realised. He had to decide, was he a sheep? Or a Wolf? Owen was startled as the door was knocked. His father walked in, and half attempted to smile at him. A poor effort at best, but Owen appreciated the effort nonetheless. He loved his father for all his faults, which there were many of yes. He was a well established business man. He didn't have time to waste. He didn't have time to spend with his messed up teenage delinquent of a son. There Owen was doing it again. Blaming himself. He was aware of what was coming next. He had already figured out that his father would pre-occupy himself with work, and make up a petty excuse that he had to fly back home for some reason or another, to escape from having to spend time with him. Was it really that bad...spending time with him? Everyone left him at some point. Owen was more than aware of that fact. Regardless of circumstances the outcome was always the same. His Mum. Dad. Friends. Dodger... During the time Owen had been thinking about this, his father had already babbled out a half assed excuse and was putting on his overpriced flashy suit jacket. Oh how he must feel important wearing it. Having power and control over his employee's. Anything to compensate for having a son that had been kicked out of more schools than he could remember and now caught up in a murder or manslaughter investigation as it no doubt would be cast off as. His father walked over to him and touched his shoulder awkwardly. Way to go dad, you really out done yourself this time. Owen smirked as he thought. \"There see, I knew that would put a smile on your face\" Owens father smiled. \"What would put a smile on my face?\" Owen stated confused. His father stared at Owen for a moment. He looked worried. \"The letter. On the table. Like I just said. Weren't you listening to me. Look O, I know things haven't been easy on you, you've had a hard time of it lately. I'm willing to give it another go, back home I mean, if you like. I will pull some strings get you back into one of those schools or something. What do you think?\" What do I think. Owen ponders. He wants to try again, let me live at home with him. Go back to one of those schools. Let's face it after Westlake Prep those schools seem as though the will have the 'Welcome Back' mats out. He called me 'O'. Hasn't done that since I was 10. Maybe he wants to change. Spend time with me, maybe even take some time off work. A flicker of hope. \"I mean I know we can work it out.\" His father says hopefully. \"We could work out a routine, I work away from home 2 or 3 weeks a month but I can manage my time, I could call Paul in accounts and...\" Owen's flicker of hope had burned and consumed. He knew that it wouldn't work. His father was lucky if he could manage one whole week at home. And out of that he would have all the phone calls, emails, beeper alerts, home interviews and all the other rat race junk that would always occupy his father's time. Owen would get bored...lonely. His dad would eventually stop making the return trip each month because of 'work commitments'. Owen would accidentally or on purpose get into trouble one way or another. And then it would be just phone calls between his dad and him. And then...it would be voice mail. How he hated voice mail conversations with his dad. Owen cleared his throat. \"Yeah. That sounds great dad. I think we can make it work too.\" Owen knew that if he rejected his dad now there would be nothing left. His dad was all he had. He would wait and see how things go. He had to stay here for a while yet anyway because of the investigation. Couldn't shoot someone then fly off the next day. Would look bad...worse even. His head was too full of thoughts to think straight just now. \"Okay O. I will phone you tomorrow when I arrive, see how you are. Get some sleep son.\" The look on his dad's face told him he too was skeptical but he wanted to give it a go. So, Owen would too. He would give him this one last chance. \"Oh and remember the letter Owen, reception said it was important. Night\". With that his father walked over to the door, picked up his suitcase and turned to smile before closing the door behind him. It shut with a slight bang. A hollow noise that made Owen feel alone. Again. If his dad was serious about giving their relationship another chance he would have stayed. Waited with him until this whole incident was sorted out. Then again, leaving was what his dad did best. Owen shook his head. \"Time will tell I suppose\" Owen muttered to the room. He walked over and closed the curtains, turned the bedside lamp on and was stepping towards the TV to switch it on hen he noticed a letter. And it was addressed to him. That was strange he thought. Then he realised who the letter was from. The handwriting was the exact same. The letter had to be from Dodger. Owen's first reaction was to rush downstairs and see if she was still there. But he didn't move. He took the letter in his hand and sat on the edge of the bed. He felt strange. He couldn't find the word for what he was feeling. But he was feeling. Which was more than he could say for the past 24 hours. Nothing. Nothing but despair, regret and emptiness. Isolation most of all. But he didn't feel that now. With the letter from Dodger in his hands he felt...excited,his heart was beating faster and he had butterflies in his stomach. He should feel disgusted perhaps even scared. But he didn't. For the first time in years he felt like someone hadn't left him. Someone cared enough to stay. Regardless of what was in the letter he knew that Dodger was thinking about him. And for an unknown reason...that gave him hope. More hope than the thought of rebuilding the doomed relationship with his father. More hope than anything he could think of. And at that moment Owen realised that Dodger was important to him. He still has feelings for her. He opened the letter. He unfolded it and stared at the piece of paper. He couldn't help himself, but he smiled. All the letter said was: \"Knock. Knock.\" And had a small emblem at the bottom of the page. It was a wolf. 'What else', he smirked. With that he folded the letter back up, slipped it inside the envelope and sat it on the bedside table. He expected a visit from little red riding hood soon. Tonight perhaps. He hoped. About an hour later he was still waiting. He had decided that it may be another game and so was getting ready for bed. He knew he wouldn't be able to sleep but he went through the motions anyway. He had took a quick shower, really quick as he didn't want to be caught off guard. As much as he wanted to believe that Dodger wanted to see him, to talk or something he was aware that maybe she wanted to leave no loose ends. So he was a little on edge to say in the least. He had just put on a clean white t-shirt and fastened his belt buckle on his black jeans when he heard two knocks at the door. He stilled. Owen walked over to the door not quickly but not slowly either. He opened the door wide and found a room service assistant. He sighed. The girl looked at him with one eyebrow pointed up. She looked maybe 19, skater girl style or maybe rock chick he wasn't entirely sure and didn't want to dwell on it. She had her ears pierced several times and her headphones were hanging from her collar with loud rock music coming from them. He though it was Nine Inch Nails that he could hear, and just smiled at her. \"Sorry, I was expecting someone else\". Owen explained. The room service girl smiled back. \"It happens.\" She glanced at the note in her hand. \"Your dad ordered this for you before he left, said he thought you wouldn't be sleeping. Even at this time.\" Owen glanced at his watch and noticed it was 11.30pm. Time seemed fuzzy today. Last night he fell asleep surprisingly easily, after everything that had happened at the police station he was shocked that he slept. He suspected his dad had gave him something to help him sleep though, doctors orders no doubt. But tonight. He was the most awake he had ever been in his life. \"Guess he was right then. Good old dad\" Owen stated sarcastically. \"Right there with you guy. I'm Jill by the way. Call if you need anything else\". Owen could have swore she was flirting with him. He was flattered. Owen smiled back at her with his most charming smile and said: \"Yeah, I will do. No problem Jill, see you around hopefully. I'm Owen in case you were wondering\" With that she started walking away, smiling at him and made her way down the hall to the next room that was on her list he assumed. Owen closed the door gently and smiled as he rested his head against the door frame. A while later he had half eaten the dinner his dad had got delivered for him, set it aside and put on the pair of converse that were sitting beside the bed. He glanced over at his hoody on the chair. He was glad he had left the hotel earlier today and picked up some new clothes and things, complimentary of his dad of course. He hadn't bought much. A backpack, a black pair of converse, two pairs of jeans, a few t-shirts and a hoody. That was much more his style than the preppy clothes he had been forced to wear at most schools he attended...however briefly. He wanted to be comfortable and be himself. At the end of the day he knew that was the only thing he had left. He had tidied up a little and was anxiously awaiting what he was beginning to doubt. Was Dodger going to come? Did he want her to? Why was she coming? Was he safe? All these thoughts had been clouding in his head since he received the letter almost two hours ago. Owen turned to look at the door as he heard approaching footsteps. Followed by two clear knocks. \"Speak of the devil.\" Owen stated. He had no doubt this time that the person on the other side of the door was Dodger. Owen gulped. Took a deep breath and walked over to the door. He paused for a split second as his hand was on the handle. He closed his eyes. Opened them, and pulled open the door quickly before he changed his mind. His eyes met hers. The moment was intense as both of them stood there not knowing what to say or do. Just caught up in their intimate eye contact. Dodger made the first move, as he suspected she might. And as confident as ever, she asked: \"So, are you going to invite me in then Owen?\" With a smile that he wasn't sure if it was genuine or wolfish. Owen smiled. \"That's the question now isn't it...\" After a second of thought Owen smiled back a replica of the smile he had just received. \"Come in Dodger\" Now Dodger was the anxious one. With that she stepped across the threshold of the hotel room door and brushed passed Owen. Owen was nervous, but he was acting calm and confident. Dodger had picked up on this the minute she had stepped in and he shut the door almost on his own hand. But she wasn't going to give him a hard time for that. He was trying to impress her, you think he would have learned. She knew what she had done was wrong. She felt guilty about it but she had decided that she wasn't going to go to jail for it. She tried to resolve it in her head as not her fault. But even she knew better. Dodger was blaming herself as much as Owen was blaming himself - Only she wasn't making it as obvious. And she would never let herself be vulnerable enough to let anyone else know either. \"Have a seat if you like...\" Owen said weakly. \"Thanks\" Dodger replied as she sat on the edge of the table facing the bed. Okay she hadn't expected it to go like this. This was really awkward. She expected shouting, screaming and blame. She expected him to tell her to never come near him again, threaten her and possibly even get violent. She deserved it after all. But to her surprise Owen sat down on the corner of the bed and looked at her. \"How are you?\" She said instantly regretting asking such a stupid question. She had tricked him, manipulated him and got him to kill someone. Of course he wasn't okay. She knew he had a crush on her, and the truth was she had a soft spot for him too. She knew he was the kind of guy that would love her and be gentle and look after her forever if she let him. Part of her wanted that. But part of her wanted more. Wanted to be surprised. To be passionate, rough, raw...exciting. Just like the game was. She hadn't meant to take it that far really, she just wanted to be in control and give everyone a good scare. But she got so jealous and one thing lead to another and now, now everything was a mess. She just wanted to prove that she was playing Chess and everyone else - the sheep - were playing checkers. As she had once told Owen. She had to tell him this, get him to believe her. She didn't know why she was seeking his approval and understanding but she felt remorse...for hurting him, if nothing else. \"I'm not so great to be honest. I'm sure I don't need to remind you why...\" Owen paused. \"Look, I don't know why you are here. Is it to laugh at me some more? To show you have the bigger balls or something. Because really there is no need. I already feel like an idiot, a dumb ass and Crichton in comparison. That what you want to hear?\" Dodger looks at the floor. \"Bigger balls good to know\" Dodger smirks. Owen laughs as does Dodger. \"Thank God...tension was getting to much for even me there Owen\" Owen looks at her. The smile stays. He knows it should fade and he should be angry at her. Tell her how wrong she was but he just can't seem to force himself to take the moral high ground with her. \"I'm about to do something I know you want Owen\" Owen gives her a flirtatious glance to further ease the tension that is still there. Dodger almost blushes. \"I'm sorry Owen. I'm sorry it was you and not me. And I'm sorry I hurt you...It was the last thing I ever wanted to do you have to believe me. I know you don't care, probably never want to see me again and I understand that.\" She sighs. \"An apology. You came here to give me an apology. Here I thought it was to tie up some loose ends. Make it look like an accident or something\" Owen jokes. \"Contrary to popular belief Owen...no. I wouldn't do that.\" Owen gives her a telling look. \"Not to you I wouldn't. I.. I promise\" Dodger manages to say. \"I believe you. Not many would, but I do.\" Owen states. Dodger can't believe he actually accepted her apology. She never expected him to. She realises that Owen doesn't have a silly immature high school crush on her, she realises for the first time that he actually cares about her. Regardless to her rejecting him. Showing him she doesn't think of him like that. He still cares whether he wants to admit it or not she can see it. And it makes her smile a genuine smile for the first time in years. A smile with no ulterior motives behind it. Dodger walks over to Owen and does something truly unexpected. She hugs him. She feels safe when she is with him, like she doesn't have to be thinking about everything else she has going on in the world, she can simply rely on him. And feel comfortable. Warm. Secure. The problem was she didn't want a good guy. She wanted a bad boy, the kind of guy that would keep her on her toe's. The kind of guy that intellectually was her equal and that she could have real passion with. Burning...Consuming...Passion. That's what she wanted in a relationship. Or what she thought she wanted. That's what she thought she had with Mr Walker...Rich, but it turned out she was simply one of his toys. Maybe gentle was better. Owen genuinely was a good guy. Perhaps a good guy is what she needed. Owen was immediately shocked. But after a few seconds he eased into the hug. He still had feelings for Dodger, but he would suppress them. She clearly didn't want him. She wanted the bad boy thing. She thought he was a clear good guy. What she didn't know...was that Owen had been a bad boy. Why else did he get kicked out of so many schools. He had had flings with teachers too. He had definitely had his fair share of bad boy days. But he was over it. He was trying to be a good guy. And it had been working for him recently. Until Dodger. If she wanted a bad boy, she was going to get a bad boy. Owen tightened the embrace. He moved his hands to her lower back. And put his head on her shoulder. Dodger breathed in, enjoying the embrace. She noticed that Owen was too. She moved with intent, it was safe to say she had his attention. \"Owen... I think I like you. A lot more than like actually. Problem is, I want a bad boy, one that will surprise and challenge me. Intellectually, physically, mentally. Everything. But I know that deep down you are a good guy. You feel guilty about everything that has happened. You feel remorse. You don't want to take the game any further, and I do. But I don't want to hurt you again, so what I think we should do is walk away from this. We both have feelings for each other, but it's just hormones that's it. If we settle at that then none of us get hurt. Okay?\" \"I don't know what you want from me Dodger. You don't know what you are asking me to be again\" Owen lifted his head to look at Dodger as he was speaking. Dodger looked up too. \"Again...?\" Dodger inquires. \"Yeah Dodger, again.Twenty Seven odd schools. Countless incidents. I've been trying to be a good guy as that's what I thought you wanted. Turns out, being me is what I should have done. Just because I'm the bad boy type doesn't mean I can't care about you without going soft. That's what you've been missing Dodge. That's the reason you weren't happy with Rich. And that's the reason I shot without hesitation as the I pulled the trigger. That's the kind of guy I am. I fight for what I want.\" \"And right now I want you Dodger\" Owen leans in to kiss Dodger passionately. Dodger is stunned. One minute she feels sorry for Owen because she thinks he is the white cap, stand up guy and the next he is telling her who he actually is.Who he has been. And who he is. He shot Rich for her...knowing? Dodger is trying to take all this in. She grins. Feeling accomplished. Feeling like she truly has won...but something a lot more than just the game this time. She kisses Owen back with more force. She let's her hands wander, Owen notices and complies. This is the passion that she wants. This is the intellect,mentality...everything that she wanted. But what is better, is that she knows that as much fun she will have exploring this new found aspect of bad boy in Owen, that after that she will have what she has actually always wanted but couldn't word...love. Owen will be there for her, but he will definitely challenge her as well. Something she was eagerly awaiting to discover. \"Owen...why didn't you kiss me like that in the library?\" Dodger jokingly comments. Owen gazes more intensely and charmingly than anyone ever has into her eyes. \"Had to save something for the aftermath Dodge\" He grins seductively and closes in for another kiss as he directs Dodger over to the bed. Owen had made his decision. He never like playing a sheep. Being a Wolf was natural to him, as it was for Dodger. This was going to be fun. \"Let the games Begin...\" They both said in unison. The End...Or is it?

I'm way too busy to right stories,in fact the only reason i got this one up was because I'm on vacation in Florida. well,this story is how i think the movie should have ended and,if any one is wondering when there done reading there is no teacher student relation ship but for Becky and walker (AKA Jon Bon Jobi) \"Tom, stop!\" Owen bolted down the stairs. \"Tom\" The silver PT drove out of site. Owen looked around the parking lot with despair,then he saw something that he jerked with joy about. It was Mr. Walkers black Chrysler. He ran up to the side door,and tried the handle. It was locked. Pulling his sleeve up over his hand he smashed out the glass. Owen reached in and pulled the door open. He dashed up the steps,his temples pounded harder with each step. Once he made his way to the top of the stairs he made his way through the head master's office, to Mr. Walkers office. He braced him self as he went toward the door,then shouldered his way into the room. Panting he looked around the empty room. He jumped when the ringing of the telephone entered his ears. Owen slowly made his way to the phone, waited a second, then picked it up. \"Hello?\" \"Owen?\" \"Dodger?\" \"what are you doing in rich's office?\" \"I'm trying to get help. Where are you?\" Silence. \"I just found Mercedes...Shes dead...What do we do?\" \"Tom and Regina already left.

I'll meet you in your room.\" \"No, i'm on my way to you.\" \"Be careful.\" \"I will\" \"Badger?\" \"Yeah Owen?\" \"I-..I love you\" \"Owen...\" There was a scream,Owen turned to look out the window. Badger was being chased by the wolf! Hes knife raised above his head. The line went dead. Owen pulled the keys out of the drawer and ran for the door as Mr. Walker stepped through the door way. \"Where the hell were you?! Badger's being attacked. Mr. walker glanced at the keys in his hand. \"You lier.\" \"What?\" \"I heard what you said on the phone,Owen.\" \"So what?\" \"I know what you were going to do. You were going to take my car and use it to take Badger away! And then you were going to the authority's and get me arrested.\" It was then Owen noteist that Mr. Walker was wearing a Grey jacket and black gloves,he looked like he had just came in from a hunting trip. In the pocket of the jacket was something heavy,something that could be a gun. \"No,i was going to take her and get help.\" \"From what?\" \"The wolf\" \"You mean the hoax?\" Mr. Walker reached into the pocket with the gun. \"Now i'm going to ask you again...From what?\" \"The Wolf\" \"I'm sorry Owen,thats the wrong answer\" At the same time as he drew the gun, Dodger walked in. \"Hello Dodger, i'm sorry but i'm going to have to kill your boyfriend here.\" \"what?!\" \"You heard me\" \"Wait\" \"what?\" Mr. Walker turned his attention to dodger. \"Owen now!\" Owen jumped him as his back was turned. Dodger took cover as the two young men fought over the gun. BAMMM. The gun went off,and Mr. Walker stood holding the gun in his right hand. The red stain grew on Owens shirt as he fell in a heap to the floor. \"Oh my god! Owen!\" \"Your next bitch\" Suddenly the door burst open and police officers came storming in. Two hours later. Randall, graham and cop. \"It was...I don't know what to say. It was just for fun, we had...We had been playing this game, and we decided that...\" \"We decided to work together tonight. We were trying to scare Owen and Mercedes...because they got every one in trouble before.\" \"Listen, we didn't think that anything was going to happen.

Dodger stood with her arms crossed as her dad walked up to her,offering a plaid coat. \"No, thanks, Dad.\" She crossed her arms again and started to cry as two cops walked by with Rich. He glared at her nostrils flaring. The officers shoved him into the car and took there seats. They started the car and drove off. 48 hours later Owen opened his eyes for the first time in a 48 hours. Pain shot through his body. His Dad was sitting beside him, reading a magazine. \"Dad..?\" His father looked up from his magazine. \"Owen..,are you alright?\" \"I'm not sure...\" \"I have good news\" \"Um.., what is it?\" \"They ran ballistics on the handgun. It turns out to be the weapon the police were looking for in the shooting of that local girl.\" \"Really?\" \"It appears you got shot by a wanted murderer.\" \"How do they know it was him?\" \"It seems he was involved with the victim at some point. They checked his credit card bill and found out he that he'd purchased two airline tickets last month. One in his name, the other in the girls.\" \"Do they know why he killed her?\" \"My attorney says they're calling it a crime a passion. No one knows that truth with these things.\" There was a knock on the door and a doctor walked in. \"Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Matthews but some of your sons friends are here to see him.\" \"Its going to be okay, Son. I promise.\" Mr. Mathews walked out and seven teen's walked in. \"Dodger.., Tom.., Randall..., Lewis..., Mercedes...,Regina..., Graham...\" Dodger stepped up,she placed a rose in the flower pot beside Owens bed. \"Owen we are all really sorry,it was a stupid prank,..I'm SO sorry...\" Randall stepped up next. For once his face was't grim, it was filled with sorrow. \"I'm really sorry man\" \"Yeah O-Dog, me too...\" Tom stepped up. \"I got you this...\" Tom handed him a black-berry. \"I broke your old one at the party\" Graham spoke up. \"Guys, shouldn't't we give this two some time alone?\" Not after long Dodger and Owen were alone. \"Thanks for the rose\" Owen placed his new cell phone on the table beside the rose. Owen looked into Dodger's eyes, and she looked back. They slowly moved together and kissed. \"I thought you Warren't a fan of PDA?\" Dodger blushed to this. \"I..umm..i-i..\" \"relax I'm kidding\" Three months later. Owen sat at his laptop typing an assignment. Owen now had his own room,and a new teacher had taken Mr. Walker's place. There was a knock on the door and Dodger slid her slim frame into the room. \"Watcha working on?\" \" A as-\" There was a bleep from the computer sceen.

But he also knew that whatever it was that Owen was doing with his tongue felt so incredibly good and he didn't really care that this was the new guy and that Dodger had already warned him that Owen was hers. Well, to bad for that bitch 'cause Owen was just to good to pass up and it was time that Dodger relearned that the shepherd wasn't always safe from the wolves. And Tom was a wolf in every sense of the word. There was a time and place for everything, Owen knew this. But he also knew that the way the tall and muscular man above him was ravaging his body was a thing that made his toes curl and his back arch. Poor Owen never knew what was happening, never knew about Tom licking his chops at the fellow boy's back as Owen went about his merry way, entertaining teachers and other students, only few knowing the dangers and plans that lurked in Tom's mind while Randall, Lewis, and Graham threw their heads back and laughed outrageously at thier leader's intentions and waited excitedly for the happenings to occur. There was a time and place for everything, Dodger knew this. But she also knew that her new little lamb had been gobbled up by a wolf and then spit back out to form another creature that was just as perversely beautiful and ferociously elegant. Owen had become an almost perfect replica of his master. And Tom smiled his beautiful Devil's smile and stood behind his new protÃ©gÃ© as he introduced the new and improved Owen to the rest of the group and every onecringed but Randall who was enthralled completely by this new pup of magnificent proportions. There was a time and place for everything, Randall knew this. But he also knew that this new kid was too much to resist and he forgot about Tom's clear and rather vicious warnings. And then he made his move and later wished he hadn't, because in all the time that he had spent with Tom, he knew how dangerous Tom could be toward others who fucked with what was his so when he saw those moss green eyes darkened in malice of the purest kind, he knew that he had royally screwed up. Therefore, Randall made his apologies to this Alpha Male, slunk away with his tail between his legs, and never forgot the one rule again that you do not fuck with what or who belongs to Tom, because if you do, you're a dead man. There was a time and place for everything, everyone knows this, its common sense and is burned into the fibre of every being. But, sometimes, there are periods when common sense deserts us for a better master and we are left to lick our wounds alone. Therefore, when Owen allowed Tom to become his master, he knew not of the privileges that came with such a title, he knew not of the jealousies or the hatred that was bestowed upon him from behind smiling faces. However, there was one thing that he did know, that whenever Tom came inside him for what seemed like the hundredth time in a single night and the lay sweating beside each other, revelling in the aftermath, he knew that his father had finally done something right. The real question of everything was... why in the hell was he thinking about his father after he just had been fucked by his jock roommate?

He was stuck inrna state of mind between total clarity and chaotic confusion, so hisrnbrain seemed to be dealing with this by affecting a sort of murkyrnclarity. It didn't really make any sense, but Owen had other thingsrnto focus on besides the irrationality of what he was feeling rightrnnow. But he couldn't seem to figure out what those other thingsrnwere. And as time oozed by, Owen felt himself slipping deeper andrndeeper into his own confusion. TOM This is friggin'rnridiculous, thought Tom. He was sitting on the sofa of his livingrnroom, staring blankly at the TV, the remote long forgotten in hisrnhand. He had been sitting this way for at least an hour. The studentsrnhad all been sent home after the recent murder of that teacher. Whatrnwas his name again? Tom couldn't seem to remember. He didn'trnparticularly care either. His mind had been flinging questions suchrnas these at him for the past hour, unrelentingly. He knew he wasrnprobably trying to distract himself. From Owen. Ever since he had metrnOwen, Tom had an increasingly hard time keeping him out of his mind.rnOwen was everywhere, his classes, his school dorm, even hisrndreams. It hadn't taken him long to realize he was attracted tornOwen. Everything Owen did had seemed amazing. How he typed, how hernheld his fork when he ate, how he mumbled in his sleep. Tom knew sornmuch about Owen that he sometimes feared he was turning into somernfreaky stalker. Everything about him fascinated Tom, right down tornhis accent. He was British, right? What's it like inrnBritain? Wondered Tom. \"Damn it!\" he exclaimed, pounding hisrnhand against the coffee table and smashing the long ignored remote inrnthe process. He didn't really care about the remote though. Hisrnparents would probably be upset over the remnants of the \"clicker\"rnwhen they got back from wherever they were. The remote was theirs,rnjust like this house was. Tom had been living at the school dorm uprnuntil this point. He wondered if he would have to go to a differentrnschool now. The school was unlikely to reopen after all the crap thatrnhad happened there. What would another school be like? He realized that hisrnbrain was trying to do the weird distracting thing to him again andrnmentally swore at himself. He didn't want to think about Owen, butrnhe didn't want to be playing these damn mind games with himself.rnThere didn't seem to be much else to do though, as the remote wasrnnow broken and Tom felt too lazy to go turn on the TV. Yeah, that wasrnthe reason. He purposely omitted the fact that he hadn't felt likernturning on the TV when he had the remote right there, intact, in hisrnhand. Or the fact that the TV was only about two meters away. Hisrnmind pointed these out to him, but Tom was feeling to tired to arguernwith himself. And, since he didn't feel like playing weird mindrngames, that only left him one choice: think about Owen. Yeah, he knewrnhis logic sucked, but he was arguing with himself. He wasrnpretty sure that now he was totally beyond making any sense. Did I just thinkrnthe word \"totally?\" wondered Tom. Now he was really starting to scare himself. )0(W(E)N( She said no onernwould believe me. Owen knew this was true. He didn't even wantrnto believe it. It was just one more time that Dodger was right. Asrnalways. Owen was ratherrnsurprised that nobody had told him to go home yet. Maybe the peoplernhere weren't used to inmates refusing to leave when they had thernchance. Inmate. Convicted criminal. Owen turned these words over inrnhis head. They seemed to be more and more sinister every time. Owenrnhad never expected to be labeled as any of these things. Until now,rnthose words had seemed rather distant and frightening. Sure, therernwas that time at his old school, but this time seemed different forrnsome reason. Maybe it was because the first time he could hardlyrngrasp the reality of what had happened. This time, time in prisonrnwas an all too real possibility. There was no escaping his fate, andrnwhen the hearing came, he knew his words would have little to do withrnthe court's decision. It was in the hands of lawyers and judgesrnnow, people he had never met. People who would take one look at thernrecords and dismiss this as an easy case, Owen feared. He remembered when hernwas a kid, and he and his family had been eating dinner. The TV hadrnbeen on, and a news reporter had been talking about a teenage boy whornhad stolen a car. They interviewed the boy's parents, who tried torndefend their son's actions. Owen's mother had then announced inrndisgust that if her son ever went to jail, she wouldn't even go tornpay his bail. And she hadn't come.rn She had stayed at home while Owen's father had paid for the bail.rnNot that Owen could blame her. No parent wants their kid to become arncriminal, and Owen's mother had always had very high moralrnstandards and an even stronger will to stand by her words. She didn'trncare to hear Owen's side of the story, the fact was, he was a criminal. He had killed someone. And Owen was forced tornaccept the rationality behind these accusations. And the rationalityrnwas, they were true. )T(o(M) Tom withdrew his carrnkeys from his coat pocket. He unlocked his car, a red van he hadrnbought used for cheap. It appeared that the previous owner hadrnattempted to commit vehicular suicide with it. He yanked hard at therndoor to the car, which reluctantly opened. One of the hinges alsornsnapped off, and the door was hanging kind of crooked now. Tomrndecided to ignore this new mutilation to his car and stepped inside,rnpulling the door shut behind him. He drove off as fast as he couldrnto get to Owen. He had decided that itrnmade the most sense to go right to where Owen was. As Owen obviouslyrnhad no intention of leaving his thoughts, Tom decided that it wasrnbetter to at least hang out with the real thing. At least it madernmore sense than going over previous conversations in his head. When Tom had heard thernrumors that Owen had been arrested for the murder of their teacher,rnTom had never believed them. Owen wouldn't do anything like that,rnhe was a good guy. And even if Owen had killed the guy, there had tornbe more to the story. There had to. Tom had to be therernfor Owen. As a friend, he told himself. As a friend. Owen had justrnbeen arrested, and Tom figured the last thing he needed was Tomrnblurting out all the stuff he felt. Tom had tried many times to makernhimself stop thinking of Owen as having even the slightestrnpossibility of being more than a friend. Owen liked Dodger.rnTherefore, he did not like Tom. Amazing Tom logic to the rescuernagain, thought Tom sarcastically. There had been a fewrntimes when Tom had tried to tell Owen how he felt. He had just toldrnhimself \"Tell him, he might return your feelings. Who gives a fuckrnabout Dodger?\" but then he had seen how close the two of them were.rnIt had made Tom angry at first. First he was angry with Dodger, thenrnat himself for thinking that way. Why couldn't he be happy forrnthem? Since then, he had tried to hide those ugly feelings of anger,rnas well as those feeling of love he had felt for Owen. It had been anrnuphill battle, but Tom felt he had mostly succeeded. Untilrnnow. His feelings for Owen had resurfaced, stronger than ever. And herndidn't want to repress them ever again. He knew that was a stupidrnthing to think, it would probably be bad for both of them, but Tomrncouldn't stop feeling this way. His feelings for Owen were maybernthe strongest emotion he had ever felt. It was like if he stoppedrnhimself from thinking about Owen, Tom would never be able to feelrnagain. Tom almost snorted out of disgust at his overly dramaticrnthought. What theâ€¦ how can I almost snort? OWEN Owen was standing up,rngazing across the room at the door, and contemplating leaving. Hernwasn't quite sure where he planned to go, but he certainly wouldn'trnbe allowed to stay here forever. He couldn't go home due to massivernshame and he couldn't go to school either, due to it being a crimernscene. He didn't really want to be around people right now. Hernconsidered the prospect of wandering aimlessly around town. He couldrnjust go for a walk, but as this was a metropolitan area the chancesrnof avoiding all people were sparse. (T)o(M) Damn traffic. Damnrnrain. Tom shot a death glare at the car in front of him. The rainrnpounded hard against the windshield of his car and as the wipersrnsteadily swung back and forth, Tom became more and more impatient.rnEvery ominous swish reminded him of how slowly he was moving.rnHow long he was taking to get to Owen. The rain had made the roadsrnslippery, coloring the tarmac, or whatever the stuff on the road wasrncalled, a shimmery black colour. The annoyingly cheerful voice of thernradio announcer had said that a car had spun out of control due tornthe slippery road conditions and had blocked up traffic. Thernannouncer had then proceeded to tell a bad joke about roosters. Tom slammed his headrnagainst the headrest and groaned in exasperation. This was taking forever . He could run faster than this. And as the windshieldrnwipers swooshed and swished and made every other damn onomatopoeiarnseemingly possible, and then some, and the line of cars in front ofrnhim still refused to move, Tom decided to do just that. Run. Hernstepped out of the car, despite several protests and yells from therndrivers behind him. Ignoring a particularly nasty threat, he slammedrnthe door behind him. He took off at a dangerously fast sprint as therncar door fell to the asphalt with a harsh clatter, raindrops clinkingrnagainst the rusted metal. He ran as fast as herncould, not even taking the time to think. The rain forced his brownrnhair down into a helmet-like shell, a few points sticking to his facernand blocking his eyes. His jacket absorbed the liquid, forcing therncold water against his warm skin. Not once did Tom ask himself why hernwas doing this. No, that's wrong, he did. The thought forced itselfrnto the surface of his consciousness several times. But Tom simplyrnforced it back down, as far away as possible. Because something wasrntelling him that if he focused on that question too much, answeredrnit, everything would end. He had to get to Owen. He had to run. Thatrnthought was the only engine that propelled Tom into this mad dash. Tom's fast pacernproved to become impossible to continue, and as his breath came inrngasps and his legs began to feel heavy, he realized he had to slowrndown. He did this reluctantly, but as common sense and physicalrnexhaustion proved to be stronger than his legs, he slowed down hisrnpace slightly. Not very much, but enough to keep him from passing outrnfrom lack of oxygen at least. Fatigue weakened Tom; his pace slowingrnand questions once more clamoring into his consciousness. He tried tornfocus on small goals, a bench, a streetlight. Then, force of will andrna sense of duty to Owen made him stop. He didn't need small goals;rnhe only had one goal he needed to accomplish; to find Owen. Tom oncernmore took off in an insane rush. (O(w)e(n)&)T)o(m) Owen sat down oncernmore and sighed. This exercise was getting exhausting on so manyrnlevels. He had spent the last few minutes (hours? Seconds? Days? Hernhad long since lost track of time.) Standing up and walking to therndoor, then changing his mind and going back to the little metalrnfolding chair in the corner. He caught himself about to repeat thisrnprocedure once more, then stopped himself. Then, he thought whyrnnot I might actually get out the door this time , and did it allrnover again, exactly the same. Or it would have been. He probablyrnwould have repeated this simple procedure a considerable number ofrntimes, all exactly the same way. But this time, it wasn't the same.rnBecause this time, the results of this much tested procedure did notrngo according to Owen's hypothesis. This time, the outcomernwas compromised by a very moist figure emerging through the door. It took Owen a momentrnto realize what exactly he was looking at. \"Tom?\" he askedrn(rather hesitantly for fear that he might actually be talking to somernlarge animal). \"Yeah,\" gasped thernfigure. It pulled its hood of from it's head, revealing pricks ofrnsopping brown hair, showing that it actually was Tom. \"What'srnup?\" he asked, for lack of anything cleverer to say to break thisrnawkward silence. Owen hesitated, andrnthen began to tell Tom everything that had happened. Owen was quiternsurprised that Tom actually listened to his story, intently, thernwhole time he talked. At first Owen suspected that it was a joke,rnthat Tom was only pretending to listen. But as time went on, and Owenrnbegan to wonder what the punch line could possibly be, he realizedrnthat Tom was serious. Tom never said anything the entire time, butrnOwen could see from his expression and unwavering gaze that he wasrnlistening. \"And the worst thingrnis, she was right. Nobody will believe me. No matter what I say, itrnsounds crazy,\" finished Owen. \"I do,\" said Tomrnquietly, staring down at the floor. \"Huh?\" asked Owen,rnnot quite sure what Tom was talking about, or even if Tom was talkingrnto him. \"I believe you,\"rnstated Tom. He lifted his head to meet Owen's eyes, and it was deadrnobvious from his somber expression that he meant what he was saying. Then Owen, withoutrnthinking, leaned forward and kissed him. On the mouth. Owen wasn'trnquite sure why, he thought that it might have been something to dornwith the lighting in the room making Tom look very attractive. That,rnof course, is hogwash. The lights were extremely harsh and not at allrnflattering, especially to someone of Tom's complexion. Also, Tomrnwas dripping wet, which would have made him glow eerily in thisrnlighting. The only beautiful light in the room was the new light inrnwhich Owen was seeing Tom. On the other hand,rnaesthetically pleasing lighting was the last thing on Tom's mind.rnHis eyes widened in surprise as he realized what was happening. Allrnhis senses lit up with the excitement and pleasure of finally havingrnhis dream realized. His dream, which up until now had seemed sornunbearably impossible. When at last theyrnpulled apart, both were gasping for breath. \"Erâ€¦ I'm sorry forrnthatâ€¦ I don't quite know what came over meâ€¦ I think thernlightingâ€¦\" stammered Owen, his face turning bright red. \"Ah, who cares aboutrnthe psychology behind it all,\" said Tom, waving a handrndismissively. He leaned forward and kissed Owen. Owen, deciding thatrnTom had the right idea, kissed him back. THE END I finally got to usernthe word hogwash somewhere! Yay (happy dance).

This is a one shot. Disclaimer: I don't own Cry Wolf. Why would anyone think I do anyway? When did the game become real? When did it start to matter? Dodger couldn't answer these questions. She had gotten everything she wanted. She had won the game. She had succesfully manipulated her friends and eliminated her enemies. It had all felt so surreal. She was standing over that girl, gun in hand. She wasn't really sure if she intended on pulling the trigger or not. That was the reason she was standing there, but she had never really thought this far ahead. Sure, she had planned it all out, in meticulous detail, but it was so different in reality. Then it was like she had been watching from overhead, out of body. The girl was dead, and Dodger walked away. Dodger didn't regret doing that. The girl deserved it. She had walked back in silence, consumed with a bizarre feeling. Not regret, Dodger had done what she had to. But she was surprised how easy it had been to do that. She wasn't really sure what she had expected, it was just one simple motion after all. She had planned it all out, but it was so weird now that it was over. Then he came along. The new kid. He seemed so perfect for her plan, so naive and trusting. She controlled him, manipulated him into doing what she wanted. It was just a few more lies. Those beautiful lies she used to lead him on. And he followed her, never suspecting that she was really the \"Wolf.\" He trusted her, and she took advantage of that trust. Eventually she began to believe the lies herself. She knew it sounded stupid, but she actually had felt something for the new kid. She told herself it was all an act, but as time went on it became easier for her to believe that what she was saying was true. Maybe some of it was. Then it was all over, as fast as it had began. He was the one who was punished, he was the one who took the fall. His only fault was his trust in other people. Misplaced trust, but there was something about his trustingness that Dodger admired. She had never been like that, ever. Sure, she used to be more trusting than she was now, now that she had been betrayed. But she had always been a rational person. If she saw a problem she got rid of it, simple as that. Couldn't Owen see that she was just a problem for him? Was he really so blind to reality? Some people just never know when to give up. In a game like this, lives are like money. They are gambled, they are wasted, and they are stolen. Some people never know when to forfeit. How can you be so blind as to think that there can be any winners in a game like this? She had come as close to winning as it was possible, right? Damn Owen. Why did he have to prove that she was indeed capable of emotion, just when she had done everything perfectly? Why did she have to fall in love again, knowing that was what had caused her so much grief before? It was so much harder to let go of everything when someone kept trying to hold on to her. He had stolen away her indifference, her perfect little fortress. And now, she felt so frail, defenseless, and disgustingly human.

The Professor was said to have killed the young girl. 'A crime of passion' they called it, but only two people really knew the truth. Dodger, a sassy, hot-tempered, young woman who is attending her second semester of her senior year at West Lake and Owen, the sweet nice guy, who fell for Dodger only a few months before. He had shot the Professor and was expelled from the school and almost was sent to jail, but they ran ballistics on the gun and it was the gun that was used to kill the young woman in the woods. Now as the seven friends are entering their second semester of their senior year and there are two new students on campus. Twins Riley and Ryan Samson transferred here from a prep school in Ohio. The students are being to pick up the pieces and the 'Liars Club' is beginning to re-assemble. They are holding their first game again tonight. Riley, the new roommate of Dodger, was sleeping soundly in her bed when she heard a tap at the window. She mumbled for Dodger to go see what it was, and after hearing the window open she assumed Dodger was leaving and she could finally get some sleep. Only moments later Dodger was shaking her awake, telling her that they were going to the chapel and to be ready in the next two minutes or they were going to drag her out of her bed with no make-up and in her pajamas. Riley groaned as she pulled on a pair of jeans and long sleeve shirt over her camisole. She quickly applied a thin layer of chap stick and some cover-up to hide her bags, since she had gotten about six hours of sleep total in the past four days. After getting dressed, Dodger opened the door and immediately shut it. She whispered that the RA was still patrolling the halls, even though it was two in the morning. Luckily they were only on the second floor and their window wasn't that high off the ground. She looked down at the ground with a looming felling. Dodger secured the window with a ruler and threw down her stepladder, incase the RA was still patrolling the halls when they got back. Riley sat on the windowsill, Dodger coaxing her down. She took a deep breath and jumped down. After getting up off the ground, she landing funny and fell on her bum, they walked towards the abandoned chapel. They met up with Tom and his new roommate Ryan, Riley's twin brother. Ryan wrapped his arms around Dodger's shoulders and placed his head on her head. Tom rolled his eyes and Riley pretended to gag. They made it to the chapel last; everyone was already there. They all mumbled a finally and Riley picked the empty bench at the front and laid across it, tired as hell. Shutting off the lights, Dodger went around and picked a random person to be the wolf. The lights went back on and they began to play. First to go was Mercedes and Lewis followed after her when she blew up at him. Then Randall got out and next was Regina was left out next. Tom was voted out and then Riley was being voted out. She rolled her eyes as she lifted up her shirt to show she had no mark. She was about to walk out of the chapel when she heard a noise coming from inside a room. She quickly opened the door, finding Regina and Randall making out. She closed the door as the two blushed and yelled at her. She walked out of the chapel, her heart racing slightly. She walked about twenty yards before she heard something behind her. She walked slightly faster and the footsteps got faster. She broke into a sprint and then felt arms grab her from behind. They grabbed her around the waist and around the mouth. She broke free and turned around, Tom. \"God damn it Tom, you fucking freaked me out\" she said a bit breathless. He just laughed and began walking towards her dorms. \"What were you doing out here anyways?\" she asked him \"you got voted out ten minutes before I got out\" \"Just wanted to scare someone,\" he said smiling. She rolled her eyes and caught up to him \"So why are you going towards my dorm?\" she asked. \"What's with the 20 questions?\" he asked her. She shrugged and they stayed in silence until they got to her window. She climbed up onto the stepladder, grabbed hold of the window ledge, and pulled herself up. She turned around and waved good bye to Tom. She pushed up the window and climbed in, replacing the ruler so Dodger could get back in when she showed up. She took off the long sleeve shirt and jeans and put back on her shorts. She climbed back into bed and fell asleep.

This is dedicated to her, and I'm sorry it took me so long to write. Disclaimer: Cry Wolf not mine. Going Somewhere This party sucked. Arnlot. Someone had brought arnlight machine that caused the entire room to pulsate with tie-dyernradiance in rhythm to some truly awful pop music. No one was dancing,rnand Tom certainly couldn't blame them. The crowd was composedrnmostly of freshman, the geeky kind â€“ and not even the interestingrngeeky kind. One was telling lame jokes to a small crowd that hadrnflocked around him and was giggling nervously. There were a few bowlsrnof junk food set out along with a tub of non-alcoholic punch. Tomrnrolled his eyes. This really did suck. The faculty had thrownrnthe party for the students, saying it was a \"reward for their hardrnwork.\" Tom knew that was a load of shit. The party was a thinlyrnveiled attempt at distracting the student body from the recentrnmurder, and the knowledge of that weighed in the minds of all thernattendees, haunting them. Tom winced at the metaphor. Most of his friends hadrnbailed to go to the chapel. Playing Cry Wolf so soon after the murderrnwas creepy, but it somehow seemed preferable to blotting the incidentrnfrom their minds with a stupid celebration. Tom would have been withrnhis friends in a heartbeat if not for his father. A few weeks ago, arnteacher had caught Tom sneaking out. Tom had said it was a one-timernthing, and though the teacher seemed to fall for it, his father hadrncorrectly suspected otherwise. \"If you pull a stunt like thatrnagain, I will have you forcibly transferred out of that school,\"rnthe man had threatened, and his son knew he wasn't bluffing. Tom'srnfather was a forceful man, as the thin pale scars on Tom's legrnreminded him â€“ when he was thirteen his father, in a fit of rage,rnhad pushed him down in the middle of the street. Tom landed on arngrate and should have probably gotten stitches, but his parents hadrnkept him home, not wanting hospital staff to ask questions. This wasrnthe same; Tom wasn't being warned to protect him from the killer,rnbut to protect the family name. You know what? Screwrnthe family name. Tom was ditching this shit party. No one askedrnquestions as he walked out the door, just followed him with theirrneyes as though they wished they were doing the same. He walked downrnthe halls with purposeful strides, each step bringing him closer tornthe chapel, his friends. Free from his father's grasp. \"Hello, Tom.\" Thernvoice shocked him back to his surrounding. A security guard stoodrnstationed by the door, smiling sickeningly at him. Damn it! \"Yo,\" saidrnTom coolly. His father had probably sent this dude to keep watch onrnhim. Okay, that was probably paranoid, but it didn't seem thatrnunlikely. \"Out for a stroll?\"rnasked the guy. \"I was actually justrnheading back to the dorm. I'm tired, planning on turning in early,\"rnlied Tom. The guard nodded asrnthough he believed that bull. Tom turned and began to walk towardsrnthe dorms, in the complete opposite of the direction he had beenrnheading. Once he was sure he was out of the guard's field ofrnvision, Tom felt his shoulders relax. Where now? the corridors seemedrnto ask. He could actuallyrndo as he said and go to his room. He wouldn't sleep, of course, butrnhe could use his computer. Maybe some of his friends would be backrnfrom the chapel soon and they could IM. The silence in his roomrnwas so heavy it seemed to push down on his lungs, making each breathrna conspicuous effort. Was this better or worse than the party? Hernreally couldn't say. The two mattresses seemed daunting, pointingrnout that he was the only one without a roommate. Sometimes he likedrnthe privacy, but right now he wished there was someone he could talkrnto. The school yearbook wasrnsplayed out on his desk and Tom gravitated towards it. Not seeingrnanything else to do, he flopped down on his bed and flipped throughrnit. There was a picture of him, looking weirdly young, as he alwaysrndid in photographs for some reason. A row down was Randall, grinningrnironically as the light flashed off his many facial piercing. Hernnever took anything seriously, did he? Dodger looked sophisticated,rnas always. And Regina lookedâ€¦ Regina. She was harderrnto sum up in a few words; he couldn't quite place why. Pretty? He'drnnever really thought of her that way. Or at least, he tried not to.rnShe was a friend, a rival, a weird but admittedly sort of cool girl.rnShe was Regina. And she was beautiful.rnThe realization shocked him. How could she be beautiful? She gratedrnon his nerves like no other human being ever had, all they did wasrnbicker. And she wasn't obviously pretty, was she? He reexamined thernphoto. She had energetic eyes behind black-rimmed glasses and wasrnflipping her hair in a parody of those shampoo commercials, smilingrnmischievously as she did so. And for some reason he couldn't quiternplace, she wasâ€¦ beautiful. Man, why was he getting so sentimental?rnThat wasn't him, he didn't see her that way. She was just fun tornargue with. Her eyes seemed to be looking straight into him, readingrnhis mind. Judging by her expression, they found what they saw highlyrnamusing. But that wasrnridiculous, it was just a photograph. \"If you're going tornjack off to my yearbook photo, at least do it when I'm out of thernroom,\" said a voice from behind him. Tom jumped and wheeled around.rnStanding right there was Regina. She continued speaking, \"I mean, Irnknow I'm gorgeous, but please restrain your urges.\" Tom felt anger risingrnup in him. This was how he normally felt around her, which reassuredrnhim a bit. That is, until embarrassment followed. Trying to hold onrnto that anger, he said, \"What are you doing here? This is the boys dorm!\" She rolled her eyes.rn\"Really?\" she asked sarcastically. \"I was wondering why therernwere so many guys here.\" \"What are you doingrnhere?\" Tom demanded. She shrugged \"I lost,rnthen I left. Figured you could use some company, since you're allrnalone here.\" He couldn't tell if she was mocking him, but forrnsome reason he was glad she had come. Suddenly the doorrnburst open and Randall burst in. \"Yo, Tom-a! Yours truly scoredrnsome beer and spiked the punch, you gotta see what the freshmen arerndoing whoaaaaâ€¦.\" He trailed off abruptly, eyes landing on Regina.rn\"Whoooaaaa,\" he repeated, and began to retreat. \"Come back herernRandall, before you go tell the whole school whatever your sick mindrncame up with!\" Regina shouted, running after him. Once again, Tom wasrnalone. But it seemed different this time, the knowledge that Reginarnhad come to visit him making him feel oddlyâ€¦ happy. Her presencernseemed to light up the room like glowing letters reading \"REGINArnWAS HERE.\" - - - The lights of policerncars flashed red and blue off the wide eyes of scared and disorientedrnstudents. They answered questions in breaking voices. They sought outrntheir friends or stood aloof and cold in the night air. Tom was stunned. Whatrnhad happened to Owen? What had happened to everyone? He spottedrnRegina in the swarm of students and police. He noticed she was one ofrnthe aloof ones, shivering with a few tears rolling down her face,rntrailing mascara after them. Tom raised a hand to his face and foundrnhis eyes were wet too. He realized he wasn't angry, he was deadrnterrified andâ€¦ sad. And he wanted to help Regina, to do whatever itrntook to make her feel better. He wrapped his armsrnaround her in what he hoped was a comforting gesture. It must havernbeen, because she leaned in against him, her head against hisrnshoulder. Her body was reassuringly warm against him. \"Where do we go fromrnhere?\" she asked quietly, meeting his gaze. \"We goâ€¦ somewhere,\"rnhe said, hoping it was the right thing to say. \"We fix things. Makernthem how they should be.\" As soon as the words were out of hisrnmouth he wanted to take them back. It was such a stupid thing to say,rnso simplistic and textbook. But Regina seemed to accept it. Close against him, shernintoned, \"Let-let's fix things together. I'll go there withrnyou.\" \"Yeah. Sounds like arnplan.\" ","Summary":" I would like to thank fl29dwnlover for the idea of writing a Tom/Regina fic.

The people here seem nice so far. Elizabeth thought as she tried to calm herself. It was amazing how nervous one could get on the first day of school wasn't it? A bell rang from somewhere over her head and teenagers started flocking towards the school doors. She quickly ran her had through her long blonde curls and then scratched at the back of her head with her newly manicured nails. Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward, her black heels making a faint clicking sound as other students rushed past her in an effort to avoid being late for class. \"Owe!\" she exclaimed as someone clipped her hip with something sharp. Liz looked up, her eyes narrowed, but not so much to her surprise, the person had simply continued. \"This is going to be long week,\" she groaned trying to hide her Australian accent. xXx \"Hey!\" A male voice shouted as Liz collided with something hard. Her papers went flying through the air and the book she had just picked up from the library fell to the ground. \"I am so sorry!\" Liz exclaimed as she quickly went to picking up the papers, her accent smothering her voice causing whoever she had ran into too laugh. \"You don't have to do the whole fake accent thing,\" he said helping her stand up. \"â€¦Excuse me?\" she asked glancing at his brown eyes before she realized that the front of her body was now wet. Looking down at her clothes, and then at his wet body, she spoke again. \"Why am I wet?\" \"Oh, sorry about that, me and some of the guys went swimming. I'm tom by the way,\" Tom offered his hand and she shook it firmly. \"Liz and it's not a problem, rather refreshing.\" She smiled. \"Tommy, who's your new girlfriend?\" Anotherâ€¦ gentleman said coming up behind him and throwing his arm around Toms neck. He was soaking wet just as Tom was; only he had the bright idea of wearing no shirt. \"Uhâ€¦ Liz, this is Randallâ€¦\" She looked him up and down, catching a glimpse various piercings. \"Shiny,\" she smirked. Randall's smile immediately disappeared and he played with his lip piercing with his tongue for a moment before he spoke again. \"I see you're already training a new bitch.\" He commented to Tom and Liz quickly shot back. \"I see you are one.\" He played the lip piercing again for a long moment and Liz found herself feeling rather uncomfortable. \"And what we? Miss Goodie Tooshoo?\" She took a step towards him, \"You got a problem with it, ring boy?\" Liz flicked at on of his nipple piercings and he moved closer towards her, their bodies were almost touching. \"I bet you haven't let a needle touch your skin in your life.\" Randall challenged, Liz grinned and turned to Tom. \"Hold my papers?\" she held them out for him and he took them confused. Turning around, Liz pulled her shirt up and used her thumb to pull the top of her jeans down slightly. Revealing a large, blue, flowery tattoo. She heard either Randall or Tom whistle and she turned back to them. Lifting her shirt just above her belly button, she showed off her navel piercing. \"No more piercings?\" Tom teased as she let her shirt fall back down. \"None that you're likely to see,\" she grinned. Then taking her books from Tom's hands she sidestepped the two and continued down the path. \"I didn't think Australians could be gay.\" Randall muttered sorely. TBC...?[Chapter 2] I'mnYour Wolf ChapternOne Liz groaned inwardly asnthe Miss Dodds, the math teacher, handed out two new worksheets fornhomework. After a moment, she realized she was not alone in herndistaste for the teachers idea of a fun evening. \"But the welcome backndance is tonight!\" A tall red head in the front exclaimed,ncrumpling up her homework and tossing it at the teacher. \"No way amnI doing math instead of getting ready!\" She rolled her hazelneyes, she didn't like the idea of having homework, but she was notnabout to ditch her responsibility just to get ready for some stupidndance. Who in their right minds schedules a dance the second weeknof school? No one even has dates! But Liz was wrong. Andnthat night as she trudged into dark, loud and crowded gym, she foundnout that most everyone had a date to that dance. Most everyone butnher that is. She stood at the door, drumming her nails on the side ofnher short skirt, trying to decide whether she should turn back or trynand dance by herself and hope someone talks to her. She really didn'tnwant to go back to her dorm room, not after all the trouble had gonenthrough getting ready for the dance. She had spent almost an hour onnher dark makeup, and nearly two hours making sure that her curls justnright. She didn't just want them down like they had been all day,nno, she had pinned them up in what she thought was a very sexy updo. Her outfit had beenneasy enough, knee high black leather boots, fish net leggings a shortnskirt and a black halter top. It would be a shame to have gottennready but not even go! Liz smiled to herself,nshe took a deep breath and then stepped into the gym. For a momentnshe felt as though her sense were having an over load. The music wasnso loud she could feel her body jump slightly in beat with the bass.nThe colored lights were flashing and spinning, almost making herndizzy. \"I didn't thinknyou'd show up!!\" Someone shouted in her ear, trying to be heardnover the music.

For a long moment,nshe was frozen, and then she started for the door as the musicnstarted up again.

Diclaimer: I don't own the characters, I'm borrowing them for this story Dream Sequence: Avoid suspicion . . . Manipulate your friends . . . Eliminate your enemies . . . \"Honestly, Owen, even if that were true... who would believe you?\" End Sequence. Owen's eyes snapped opened and he quickly sat up. Sweat ran down his face and his nicely toned chest was heaving as if there wasn't enough oxygen in the world to save him. Once his breathing was under control his eyes strayed over to his clock. The numbers 3:47 glared back at him. He sighed, knowing that he would not be getting anymore sleep that night. Sleepily, he rubbed his eyes and got to his feet then walked towards his shower. He turned the hot nozzle to full blast and watched as the water erupted like a volcano, the clear drops cascading down the linoleum walls. After stripping down to his birthday suit, Owen stepped into the scalding water and put his head underneath the showerhead, letting the water flow down his face. Owen didn't know how long he had stayed like that under the water when his phone rang. He let out a groan and quickly stepped from his haven scrambling to find a towel to cover himself with. His wet hand grabbed onto the flashing numbers and quickly clicked the ON button. \"Hello?\" his English accent flowing smoothly through the air. \"Hey Owenâ€¦ it's Tom,\" the familiar voice spoke. Owen unconsciously cringed at the realization of Tom; one of the people who set him upâ€¦ was one of the members of the group that pushed him to shooting an innocent man. \"What do you want Tom,\" he asked, his voice instantly cold and as empty as his heart felt. A sigh was heard through the phone. \"We heard that the charges were droppedâ€¦ and we also heard that you could come back to schoolâ€¦\" \"I'm not going back Tom,\" Owen interrupted. \"Oh come one man! You know, I'm sure Dodger misses you, she's been extra PMSIE lately,\" Tom tried to convince Owen; unaware that the red head had indeed been responsible for every problem Owen had suffered through. \"I'm sure she has,\" Owen muttered, purely disgusted by the thought of the girl. Another sigh. \"Well if you change your mind, we'll still be here, even though I'm pretty sure we're the last ones you'd wanna lay your eyes on.\" \"Maybe we'll talk again soon, goodbye Tom.\" And with that, Owen clicked the OFF button and set the phone back on its charger.

At the end of the last story (Cry wolf 1) Mr Walker was shot dead by Owen in what he thought was self defence. Dodger had manipulated every one into thinking it was a game, but it was very real. Mr Walker was blamed for the death of a young girl named Becky. But only Owen knows the truth. He is blackmailed in to secrecy as if Mr Walker is not a murderer then he killed an innocent man and will be locked away for it. Although Dodger had ended her affair with the teacher at West Lake Preparatory Academy she now yearned for the taste blood. She loved the manipulation and games she played. She loved to see people scared out of their wits. And most of all she loved making sure that someone else got blamed. This time she's back and ready to kill another victim with the help of her new found friends at Eastern Dale Academy. Same game, Different rules \"Are you ready for tonight?\" Dodger whispered, because her teacher was a control freak and didn't allow any talking whatsoever. \"Yeah we can use that abandoned warehouse. No one has been there in ten years. They think it's haunted. \" Marie whispered back getting caught by Mr Dutchman who slammed his ruler on her desk. \"This is a class room not a party miss Colorina. What did I say about talking? Don't do it! Detention after school! And if I hear you speak another word you will have a week's detention!\" She sat back in her chair thinking of a way to get back at him, maybe give him a little scare. The active blonde girl was into pranks. One time the lunch lady's hair turned purple for some un explained reason. Of course that was her work. There were many others that came after: Worms in a kids lunch, whoppy cushion with the micro phone, changing the impromter to say rude and insulting things about students they didn't like ect. She got better every year with the help of her friends, although she didn't like to admit it. They all arrived at the abandoned warehouse at 8.This was the first time they had been there as Dodger had just transferred from West Lake Preparatory Academy where a serial killer named the wolf orginated. This was unknown to this group of friends or even thier school because they were thousand of miles away in a different country where the wolf was free to strike again. It was pitch black outside except for the glow of the full moon. They all sat in a circle ready to play- cry wolf. They flashed their torches in an idiotic manner, trying to psych each other out. \"Everybody hand your money in.\" Dodger walked around gathering the green dollars. \"I'm going to secretly pick one person in the group to be the liar, the wolf. The rest of you are sheep. You must convince the rest of the group to vote out the wolf. If you to the money is all yours. But if the wolf wins the cash is theirs.\" They all close their eyes and dodger walked around waiting to mark the wolf. There were six of them all together: Marie, a fair haired girl who loved pranks, Tenequa; an Asian model that gets all the boys, Sam the art prodigy, Greg the computer genius ,Rover the best poker player in town and Dodger the mysterious one. Dodger approached a blonde boy by the name of Rover. He had his hair spiked up with gel and sunglasses covered his face. He was quite muscular in build as was visible because he was wearing a singlet for a top. She marked him as the wolf, using the red lipstick from here pocket. \"You can open you eyes now let the lies begin.\" \"I think Marie is the wolf\" Sam called out. \"You're just trying to blame it on me when really you're the wolf.\" \"Whoever thinks Sam is the wolf, raise you hand \", everybody raises their hand. \" Do you seriously think it me?\" \"Yes\", the voices echoed throughout the dark and gloomy building. \"Show the mark\" dodger said knowing it wasn't him. He lifted up his shirt showing only pale white skin and no trace of any lipstick. He walks out of the room cursing at the others. The wolf is still not found. One by one they are all voted out until only Rover andTenequa remained. Rover was victorious. He had one their first ever game of cry wolf. \"Well done. The best of the amateurs.\" \"Amateur?\" \"You haven't seen nothing yet\" Dodger stated with a mysterious grin on her face. \"Here you are its all yours\", dodger gave him the money he had one. Rover stood there for 5 minutes blank faced wondering what she meant. \"You were the wolf huh? I should have guessed! You were all ways the best bluffer in poker\", Marie admitted. \"I can't believe you voted me out! I told you it was him\", Greg the guy with the electric blue hair shoutedthe group\"Hey calm down I bet it was just beginners luck right\", Rover reasoned. \"I still lost my money!\" , a few of them rebelled. \"Next time you'll be paying up, I guarantee it.\" \"Oh really you wanna bet on it\" \"Hell yeah\", Greg shouted. Dodger just laughed knowing they would only be two easy to fool. \"Wanna pull a prank on Mr Dutchman today?\" Marie asked the group. \"I don't know wont he gives us like a thousand detentions for this?\" Tenequa said, standing up. \"He's never going to find out, so how can he punish us?\" She slouched back in her chair. \"Why don't we set up a ton of paint above the door? The when he opens it will spill all over him.\" \"Ok but this time make sure it's permanent. \"It's going to be so funny\" \"I wanna catch the look on his face on my camera.\" \"Wont that is a little suspicious that you knew it was going to fall on his head?\" \"Maybe Ill just have a psychic vision.\" Late at night she decided to post the story on the school forum about a killer (a new one this time) wearing black sunglasses with a white rim, a blue balaclava over his head A skull tattoo on his right arm and he carried a gun with him and used it to kill a girl that died last night. The killer admitted to killing this girl and said he would do it again. The killer said he would come to our school and shoot one person per night and they would never find him. She posted this letter on rover's computer (she broke in and took it that night and retuned it in the morning) so he would be blamed if anyone found out. Dodger knew this would work because she had done it before. Rover awoke to hear the police at his door.\" Young man it is not funny to post a comment from a \"serial killer\" and claim to have been involved in a murder. The family of the woman were out raged when they found out some kid had claimed to have killed Amerie!\" \"Rover you are going to have a whole month of detentions for this!\" \"What serial killer? What are you talking about? I didn't do anything!\" \"Drop the innocent act, Im not buying it.\" The police have decided not to take further action. But if this happens again you will be expelled and will never set foot in this school again! Rover realised they were serious and immediately came to the conclusion that he got pranked. He walked over to Marries dorm room and knocked on the door. \"Marie did you pull that prank on me?\" What prank?\" \"You know what prank! How could you do this? Now Im going to have detention for a lifetime!\" \"Wow I'm flattered she said blushing slightly But It wasn't me maybe Mr Dutchman has sworn revenge against you for that prank you pulled\" She said laughing her guts out.\" \"You mean the prank you pulled?\" \"Whatever, I didn't have you computer last night did I?\" \"No I had it. Someone must have broken in. But who?\" He paced back and forwards wondering who this mystery person was.\" \"It could be Ross he's all ways had a thing against you ever since tenth grade when you beat him in poker and took all his money.\" \"Ah he's just a sore loser. I don't think he's smart enough anyway\" \"good point\" \"Maybe the killer broke into your dorm and wrote it?\" He looked at her strangely. \"Hey it's just a suggestion.\" \"I have to figure out who did it otherwise they'll do it again and I'll be expelled. You should ask Greg he's the computer genius he nodded as he turned around and left the room.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Setting the trap \"Someone stole my computer last night\", dodger claimed, making up a believable alibi. \"Someone snuck into my room and wrote about a serial killer on mine. Now I have detention for a month.\" Rover explained in an upset voice. \"Looks like it may be the same guy\" Dodger said further defining her \"apparent\" innocence. \"Let's ask Greg to check it out.\" She nodded smiling maliciously as soon as he turned his back. \"I'm pretty sure someone hacked Greg claimed, furiously typing on the keyboard. Next time get an anti hacking program installed\" he said a tone suggesting it should have been done long before. \"Whatever, Rover shrugged in annoyance. \"It doesn't look like there's anything I can do Greg said thoughtfully.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Breaking in... \"But why would the janitor enter my dorm room? It just doesn't make any sense\" \"Why don't you go ask him yourself?\" Greg said annoyed that Rover couldn't stop talking about the night before. \"I swear he was wearing a mask to cover his identity, he has to be hiding something.\" \"Are you sure you're not just making this up?\" \"I saw him with my own eyes\" \"look I bet cha it was just some kid trying to steal some stuff, Marie added \"I mean no ones that good except for me of course but I was here so it wasn't me.\" \"Then why do you look so suspicious?\" Dodger questioned. \"Me? What about you? How come you didn't see the cameras go blind? How come you didn't see anything?\" \"Before the cameras went out I saw something\", she explained as she examined the footage once more. The fiery red head paused the tape and in turn looked back at the group as they glared in astonishment. In the far corner of the screen they saw a heavily shrouded man steadily pull out a hand gun and shoot the video camera. \"I came to check it out, but he had already disappeared. If we want to find this guy we've got to be one step ahead of him. At break let's break into the janitor's office and see what he's hiding in there. Be careful though we don't want him to find out what were doing.\" The murderer left his office and ventured into the corridors to the clean the floors. \"He's gone, here's our chance. They waited a little while just to make sure. \"Did you get the distraction ready?\" \"Yep there will be a food fight in no time.\" Rover reassured his companion. Did you bring the hair pin?\" Tenequa handed the hair piece to Dodger. She began fiddling with the lock carefully, only taking a few moments to open the pale coloured door. It slowly creaked open revealing a perfectly spotless room. \"Look around, but leave everything exactly where you found it\". \"Mop, bucket, cloth\", Greg said unenthusiastically while throwing the items aside. \"We should have hooked him up in a lie detector, but no were doing it the hard way. Besides there nothing here but mops, and buckets and janitor stuff, and you know why? Because it's a janitors office! I don't know what you guys expect. I mean if he's a serial killer do you think he'd be stupid enough to hide his weapons in here? When the cops came this would be the first place they'd look. The stuffs probably buried under his house. We'd have more luck looking in a grave yard if you ask me\" \"We didn't ask you, did we?\" \"Oh my god!\" Marie stood there with her mouth thrust open. \"I think I've found something, its, its...\" she spoke with hesitation in her voice. They all rushed in immediately and looked around trying to find it. \"What is it?\" they questioned. \"I can't see anything, maybe we should look in that closet, it seems suspicious .It has a lock on it but I think I can unbolt it\", Dodger said ignoring her as if she knew where the real evidence was hidden. \"Where exactly did you find this object?\" Rover interrogated in disbelief. She lifted up a black balaclava and placed one hand on her hips. \"Interesting that it wasn't there before\" Rover said. \"Then why is there blood on it?\" \"Maybe because you put it there!\" \"Is there any blood on my hands?\" She faced her palms towards them. Rover seemed not the slightest bit amused by this and walked up to her. He pulled up her cotton sleeves to reveal her arms. There was not a trace of blood to be seen. \"What? That's impossible! I know when you're faking. I'm never wrong.\" She produced a cunning smirk as they debated whether this was true evidence or not. \"How do we know it's not tomato sauce or something?\" \"Would I lie to you guys? All just for a prank?\" \"Its fake blood isn't it?\" \"Now where in the world would I find fake blood?\" \"Hand it over.\" \"Why so you can use it to trick me? I don't think so.\" \"How do I know you're not going to pull another prank?\" \"You don't\" He snatched the tube from her. \"Don't worry there's more where that came form\", she said as she gave him a cheeky smile. \"Guys I think we should get back to our investigation now, you know before break ends.\" Sam interrupted, slightly annoyed. \"Wait was that you before on the camera pretending to be the janitor?\" Greg asked curiously. \"No would you think that?\" \"Well since you have the same mask and you're the one who 'saw' the janitor it does look pretty suspicious if you ask me.\" \"You're the one who said let's split up. It's not my fault you're so impatient\" \"There was no blood on the mask last night\" Sam said- (being an art student he pays a lot on attention to detail). He also added that the balaclava was blue not black. \"There's no time for jokes, we need to hurry before he comes back and sees us. Who knows he could be the killer and if he is we don't want him to find us searching though his things otherwise we'll be goners. \" Dodger turns her attention to the closet. \"I think there may be something in there though. We need to open it. Anyone got some tools?\" foot steps could be heard form outside. \"Quick hide!\" jingle, jingle . The sound of keys moving about echoed through the room. Click . The door knob turned. Creek . The door swung open at a snails pace. The man stormed in carrying his trusty mop and bucket. \"Stupid kids starting a food fight, he growled. Making me have to clean it up and throwing crud at me. One of these days I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.\" He took the silver painted keys and unlocked the bolt on the mysterious cupboard. His eyes searched for something important. Something very important. The janitor reached for the item rapped in a turquoise cloth. He wiped the cloth over it like a man would with a gun. \"It's the hand gun\" Dodger whispered \"Shh! he'll hear us\", A voice whispered back. The man froze and glanced around the room. \"Is anyone in there?\" He examined the ground for footprints and dirt. \"I think someone's been in here, but the real question is who? He picked up the mask that Marie had accidentally dropped. He placed it in his bucket under other items so it was no longer visible to the naked eye. The whole group was shocked. They never thought this would happen. They never thought he would find out. But how did he find out? That was a question they would never find out. He was going to murder them using the gun. And no one would find out because he would hide the evidence and no one would suspect a janitor, no one but them. \"Now where is my ammunition?\" He smiled showing his crooked teeth all prodded and bent out of place. \"Hehe\", he chuckled. \"I'll show them sneaky little buggers. Their not going to see the light of day when I'm through with them.\" He pulled off the cloth and loaded the gun. The janitor's eyes glowed with rage and hate. He laughed manically and pointed the gun at the wall. It pointed towards Rover. He stared intensely at the spot as if he knew the blonde boy was hiding there. He crept closer, still aiming with the gun. He stood there behind the curtain, careful not to make any sudden moves in hope that the gun wasn't actually aimed at him. Adrenaline rushed through his body. His muscles pulsed, ready for impact. Sweat trickled down from his forehead and dipped down to the floor. His breathing became slow and deep. Rover's heart pounded, getting faster and faster every second. Time slowed down. A moment felt like days as he came to the realization that within minutes he would be dead. Click , the safety clutch was flicked of. He steadied his hand and slid his fingers across the weapon so they could just feel the trigger. Rover crossed his arms over his chest protecting himself. \"Bye-bye, you little pest!\" the earth seemed to stop moving for a split second and then... bang!! Bang!! To be continued...

Ever sincenAmy and her friends heard about the people who played Cry Wolf andnthen it turned out that one of the girls were just playing a prank,nthey were obsessed. Every other night they got in their chat roomn\"cry wolf\" on AIM and played together. The shepherd was alwaysnJohn. He wasn't into playing, just picking the sheep and thenwolves. Amy loggednoff, happy that Aaron was kicked out first, and went to get ready fornschool. There she would meet all her friends in the hall wayâ€¦So,nshe got her book bag and went out to the bus. Today was the last daynbefore Winter Breakâ€¦She couldn't wait to be free for 2 and a halfnweeks to do ANYTHING with her and her friendsâ€¦Even play Cry Wolfâ€¦ To bencontinued.[Chapter 3] -1CHAPTERn2: At school. \"So,nAmy, being a bitch as always?\" Aaron asked Amy. Amy smirked atnAaron and continued to walk to home room. The teacher clicked allnover on her computer as Amy looked through her agenda. WOOT! No homenwork for 2 whole weeks! That's what she couldn't wait for. Thenannouncements came on, yada yada yada, the same old crap about itnFINALLY being winter break, and then Period 1. Orchestra. Shenstrummed and strummed away until it was Period 2-3. Shawntenand her walked into class and sat down next to each other. Shawntenwas black, had short black hair, black eyes and loved to wear allnsorts of colorful clothes. The reason why Shawnte was in the CryWolfngame was because she and Amy had a class together. Shawnte had beennquiet and never spoke a word. But Amy talked to her so much that shenjust started talking more and more. Shawnte usually just playednCryWolf to be with the \"in\" crowd. Well, technically, but shenstill liked the game! Amy really got her interested in it. They'dnspend hours laughing and talking, and sometimes when Shawnte wasnlucky, she would win. But most of the time people picked her to leavenbecause she kept talking to Amy. Thenperiod ended and they all stormed out to period 4-7. The next classnAndrew and her shared. Shawnte was too, but she was seated across thenroom due to talking to Amy so much. Andrew was skinny, wavy dirtynblond hair and blue eyes. He usually would wear a simple brownnAbercombie shirt and shorts, and sandals, even though it was Winter.nHe was pretty dumb but liked wild life like frogs and stuff. He knewnAmy through Aaron, even though he just thought Amy was a pain in thenass. Plus Amy would call him like 5 times a day, which got quitenannoying. \"What's today's homework?\" Andrew would ask Amy. Henhad trouble doing homework. Periodn8 is Lunch. EVERYONE who played CryWolf with Amy had lunch together.nAaron was there, who had curly blond hair, puppy dog eyes that werenblue and a smile that was captivating-but not to Amy. He was roughnand tough on the outside but on the inside was deep and emotional.nThen John who had silky straight brown hair and slanted eyes thatnwere a lily pad green. He had a sense of humor but was as quiet as anmime. Kind of like Shawnte before she met Amy. Amy had never reallyntalked to John that much, so didn't know too much about him. Annanhad long straight blonde hair and big brown eyes. She had a big smilenthat was always on and had a laugh like a queen. She got perfectngrades and would never be seen without make up. Samantha was the onlynone on the chubby side. She was a cheerleader and had dyed blondenhair. She was always doing a cheer for everyone and laughing her headnoff. The last was Ryan who had long brown hair that went down to hisneyes and a piercing on his tongue. He was one of those punk/ska kindanguys. He was an out cast so Amy brought him in the group. Periodn9-11. WHAT A NAME! English class. The teacher was hilarious andnalways had Amy laughing so hard that everyone turned to look at her.nShe walked out of the class at the end of the period to 12thnperiod, where it was Gym! She set all her books down, got changed,nplayed dodge ball, got dressed again and ran out to the bus.nFINALLY-it was Winter break! ","Summary":" Intronto: CryWolf 2: The Wolf Who Cried Sheep Plot: When angroup of teenagers play the online game "},{"Movie":"Hanna","Title":"Are We Going To Kiss Now?","Author":"ShyRainbow","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8476401","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I don't own anything, yo. Are We Going To Kiss Now? The first thoughts of Hanna were something along the lines of sore loser and mentally insane. Both of which was right, proven when Sophie first spoke to Hanna, during ridiculous Math class. Sophie needed the answers to the Mathematic problems that were quite due at the end of the class period. Her friends did not have this gods-forsaken class. The option to cheat was shot down when the stupid-polka-dot-tie-wearing teacher would not allow Sophie to move near Richard Rivers who was a wiz for numbers. It only leads Sophie to three options of whom she could copy off of: Ugly, crooked-nose Johnny Vroom; creepy-ass Jasper Lily; or the new, foreign girl Hanna. \"Hey.\" Sophie said to pale girl. The said girl quickly, accurately turns her head and looks at Sophie for a few seconds, surprised. The blonde girl just stares. Sophie stared back, a bit weirded out, \"Hello?\" Hanna does not reply, rather she quietly looks at Sophie as if she has no idea what she was suppose to be doing at that very moment. Sophie slightly raises one of her eyebrows. She should be annoyed with the odd girl but something in the foreign girl's bright blue eyes didn't bug Sophie as much as it should. \"Don't you speak English?\" It wasn't a rude question. Well, Sophie likes to think it wasn't. \"It's not your fault if you can't. M.I.A. didn't speak English 'till she was eight, because she was, like, a refugee or something from Sri Lanka. Now she's a pop star, in America too.\" Sophie looks and shrugs at the quiet girl. \"But don't worry if you can't speak English yet.\" The foreign student blinked as if she was taking all of this information and processing it over a few times. Suddenly, the teacher called all the class work to be turned in. And on that day, Sophie only got two answers right, without the help of that freaky foreign girl. Sophie groaned loudly when she got home. \"Got the cramps?\" asked Sophie's British mother, Rachel, who was drawing circles on a map of Eastern Europe for their bi-annual family holiday road trip. \"I know some excellent remedies to ease the blood flo â€“ \" \"Mum!\" Sophie yelled. \"Gross! Miles is right there.\" Her dad asked, \"Sophie, how was school? Lovely?\" He was fumbling around with a broken controller for the television. \"I remember my high school years! Well, a bit of it. Since I was never at one place.\" It was her mother, reminiscing out loud like the usual. Sophie rolled her eyes, annoyed by her parents. \"It was just splendid, dad.\" \"You don't sound chirpy,\" Sophie's dad noted while tinkering the controller, \" â€“ this damn deviceâ€¦\" \"It's school, dad, and could you stop messing with that thing? You're never going to fix it.\" Sophie's annoyance drips through her sentence. \"It will, dear. Just need to read the blasted manualâ€¦ Where is the manual? Rachel?\" \"You mean the yellow book? I threw it in the recycling, just now. Shouldn't waste the trees, Aunt Sucksby would say.\" \"Miss Sucksby's a bit not right in the head, Rachelâ€¦\" The man sighed, \"Sophie, can you be a dear and fetch it for me?\" Sophie groaned with annoyance and shoved open the door. The recycling bin was in the front of their small lawn. Sophie walked towards the bin and opened the lid. It only took her a few seconds to find the yellow manual. When Sophie closed the lid, she was scared out of her wits when she saw the freaky foreign student standing right in front of her. \" Shit !\" Sophie shouted and nearly jumped out of her skin. \"What the actual fuck ?\" Sophie stares at the newcomer incredulously, \"Are you, like, one of those weird lesbo stalkers that's been on London news? I mean it's not like I have anything going at odds with lesbians. Although you don't look lesbo, besides that tacky, worn sandal and gross robe. Are you a lesbo? Wait , you don't speak English.\" Blinking, the blonde girl looks at Sophie, then slowly opens her mouth to speak. \"Who's she?\" Miles asked, suddenly, staring at the blonde stranger while asking his sister. \"She can't speak English. She's a lesbo stalker. She's from America like M.I.A.\" Sophie answered Miles' question as he looks at the stranger. \"I'm from Germany,\" the blonde girl spoke; her pronunciation was precise, and one could definitely tell she was not from around the United Kingdom. \"Oh,\" Sophie looked at the foreign girl, taken back by her answer. \"I lived in Leipzig, German city. Population 0.7 million peoples. We live at number seven, Weissingerplatz. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I also have a dog called Trudi.\" Sophie and Miles stared at the blonde strangerâ€¦ \"We had a dog called Vincent. He went mad and died,\" Miles told the girl. \"She's beautiful. I wish I had a body like hers. Well, her boobs are a bit too ginormous. Pretty sure she got boob implants.\" Sophie emphasizes her point by motioning her hands over her own breast. Hanna looks at her movements and tries to understand the teenage girl. \"Super models love plastic surgery and boob jobs. They have tons of husbands, too.\" \"Sophie, stop that nonsense,\" it was Sophie's dad who is never in agreement with his growing teenage daughter. Sophie's parents are at odds with their daughter's generation. They're now trying to adapt into the newer, mainstream generation while still holding on to their ideals and social liberationâ€¦ Pretty much old farts, Sophie would say. \"My mum's against plastic surgery.\" Sophie animatedly explains to Hanna. Her face crinkles, \"Like, it doesn't bring a natural aura or something.\" Sophie looks at Hanna disbelievingly, \"Mum doesn't even wear makeup.\" \"I don't. I think it's dishonest.\" The mother nods in agreement. Hanna turns to look at the mother. \"This is my face. Take it or leave it! If you study History of Art, Anthropologyâ€¦\" \"Here we goâ€¦\" Sophie mumbles and sips her cup of soft drink. \"She got a first in Cambridge,\" quipped Sebastian as he tore a piece of chicken. They were having 'lunchinner' â€“ Sophie's mother would call it â€“ which was a meal between lunch and dinner to which Hanna has never heard of before. Not even in her encyclopedia. \"â€¦ You learn that that red lipstick mimics arousal and suggests the geography of the labia minora.\" Rachel continues, pointing at her light, pale lips. \" Vomitorium .\" Sophie sticks out her tongue in disgust. \"Stop that, Sophie.\" Sebastian nagged at the teenage girl. \"Where as I have a lot of natural red pigments in my lips, and so I really don't need it,\" the mother finishes with an air of self-defined dignity and great liberation. Hanna slightly nods, taking in this newfound information. \"What? This is embarrassing!\" Sophie argued. \"Just grow up! Alright?\" \"Grow up?\" Sophie asked with defiance towards her father. \"Yeah!\" \"Oh, because yesterday mum was saying how I shouldn't act beyond my years.\" Sophie says while glaring at her dad. \"No, it leaves her with mixed messages, darling. Because we're trying to communicate to her how to enjoy childhood.\" Rachel explains while picking at her food and giving some to Miles. \"I just want her to stop saying 'vomitorium,' alright?\" Sebastian annoyingly states as he picks at his chews. Miles pretended to vomit, just to spite his father. \"Hey! That's not funny,\" says Sophie's dad. Rachel shakes her head in annoyance and continues to feed her son. Hanna with a ghost of a smile amusingly watches the display between the family members. She was truly enjoying their presence. \"So, Hanna,\" Sebastian started, talking to the silent German girl. \"It is Hanna, right?\" Hanna nods and grabs a piece of chicken placed around the table, enjoying the taste of the seasoning and texture. Different from deer meat. \"Oh. I'm Sebastian Lyall, Sophie's dad. This is Rachel, the mum.\" The man introduced. \"You live around here, don't you?\" Sophie glances at Hanna, interested in the quiet girl. \"We live at number seven,\" Hanna answered. \"That's just around the corners,\" Sebastian stated. Noticing that Hanna used a plural pronoun, he asked, \"You live with your father and mother?\" \"My mother is dead.\" \"Nice one, dad!\" said Sophie as she gave her dad a glare. Sebastian ignored his daughter's remark, \"I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my mum when I was very young, soâ€¦\" \"It is all right, it happened a long time ago.\" Seeing as how Hanna brushed the subject easily and seems okay with it, Sophie's mom politely asked, \"Hanna, what did your mum die of?\" \"Three bullets,\" Hanna stated casually while looking at the mother as if it was the most normal answer. Sebastian choked on his drink and some of the soft drink came through his nostrils. \"That's appalling!\" Sophie's mom said, shocked. Miles nods in agreement. Sophie was weirdly impressed. A/N: Hey. I liked the movie. I liked the characters. I liked the soundtrack. I'm sorry if my british-ness does not shine through the story. I'm writing for the fun, so go along with it. I love the writing in the movie, so you will be seeing me throw in every good quote that I deem fitting into my not-beta'd story. Cheers.[Chapter 2] \"And M.I.A. was born in London. Unbelievable, right?\" It was another school day that was nearing the weekends. Sophie was leaving her house when she spotted Hanna down the road. They had decided to walk together. Hanna nods, trying her best to keep up with the English girl's conversation. The brunette was very talkative, Hanna noted. The German girl found herself confused and lost whenever the English girl would talk. Maybe it was her fast British accent. But, Hanna enjoyed being around the English teenager. They were in school hallway. Sophie notices some boys across the hall. Spanish boys. The brunette winks at them and turns to Hanna, \"Weekend, busy?\" \"Weekend?\" Hanna repeats. \"Have you got anything to do?\" \"No.\" \"Yes, you do.\" \"I do?\" Hanna confused, once again. \"You're coming sleepover at mine's,\" Sophie smiles mischievously, \"on one condition.\" \"What?\" Hanna curiously leans in closer to Sophie because the English teenager was lowering her voice. \"Those boys, over there. Spanish. Gorgeous.\" Sophie informs Hanna, as her pale hazel eyes glances at the Spanish boys leaning on the lockers. Hanna turns her head fully towards them and notices two of the Spanish guys looking over at them. \"No, don't stare at them.\" Hanna looks back at Sophie. \"Don't go all pruny about it, like my mate Paula,\" Sophie jokes, continuing to talk about the Latino boys across the hall, \"They haven't got their eyebrows waxedâ€¦ or anything!\" Sophie smirks with excitement. \"Good.\" Hanna nods, still lost, but decided by Sophie's expression that this was a great, positive thing. \"Anyway, we're going out tonight and you're coming along,\" Sophie looks at Hanna, seeing if she needs more persuasion to usher the German girl. \"Alright.\" Hanna agrees automatically. Sophie smiles at the pleasant surprise of how quickly the German girl agreed to tag along. \"God, you're not hard to convince!\" Sophie states while raising her eyebrows, quickly liking the quiet foreign teenager, \"Hoe.\" \"Who?\" Hanna asked, infinitely confused. Sophie quickly glances at Hanna's attire. \"Have you got anything to wear? You can't wear that, obviously. You look like some mad German.\" And with that, Sophie walks down the hall to her next class, leaving a confused Hanna behind to wonder what they were talking about. It turns out that Sophie and Hanna had a few more classes together. Certainly, literature class was included in their conjoined classes. Sophie thinks the literature teacher is a bitch spawned from hell. Marissa Wiegler. \"Passed your summer essays, children.\" Sophie never liked her thick Southern accent from gods-knows-where. Probably from hell. Since she was a she-devil; Marissa even had the red hair to prove her association with hell. \"Miss Wiegler, is it okay if we did not do the correct heading?\" A random student asked. The teacher gave a sadistic smile. \"Sorry, darling. It's an automatic zero.\" Sophie looked at Hanna across the room and rolled her eyes. Sophie believes the teacher was such a sour puss because her husband left her after she had an abortion. Or miscarriage. Or something like that. \"Can we please put the papers in alphabetical order, kids? We aren't in elementary anymore!\" The she-devil hissed at her class as she shuffled the papers being turned in. \"Are there anymore papers? I will not accept them as late work.\" Some students were hastily walking towards her desk to turn in their printed out essays. Hanna walked up and placed her loose-leaf paper in the right position of order. Marissa glanced at the new face in her room, albeit every student was a fresh face since she never taught a Junior class before. But, somehow, Marissa found this pale, foreign girl incredibly irritating. Perhaps it was because Hanna's essay was a piece of loose-leaf paper rather than a print paperâ€¦ \"Hm?\" Marissa hummed, \"Are you new, sweetheart?\" Hanna, not knowing that the teacher was addressing her, ignored the literature teacher and went back to her seat. Marissa saw this as extremely disrespectful and gripped her chalk eraser tightly. \"Hanna, was it?\" Marissa smiled, that which never reach her eyes. Sophie always felt chilly in Wiegler's presence whenever she shines those insanely bright teeth. Psycho as hell. Hanna nods, studying the teacher â€“ not liking her aura. It was not friendly or comforting compared to Sophie's and her family. She was on guard. \"Don't you speak English? Where are you from?\" The teacher looked at Hanna like she was an experiment. A little piggy in a pen. \"I lived in Leipzig, German city. Population 0.7 million peoples.\" Hanna answers the teacher. The teacher, surprised by Hanna's answer, stares at Hanna, dumbfounded. Hanna continues, \"I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I also have a dog called â€“ \" Marissa automatically thinks Hanna was smart-mouthing her. \"Enough!\" Marissa's patience wearing thin. The class was dead silent, and Sophie tried her best not to snicker or else she would set the world on fire due to Marissa's anger rising. That girl is so weird, Sophie smiles and covers her mouth.[Chapter 3] A/N : Apologizing in advance for throwing in a lot of grammatical errors and movie quotes. Hanna was supposed to meet up with Sophie around 11 PM in Sophie's home. However, it was already a bit late after 11 PM when Hanna arrived at Sophie's house. Sophie mentioned something about sneaking Hanna in, so that must have meant that Hanna had to go in Sophie's house unnoticed. So, the window to the living room was broken from the hinges and that was how Hanna came into Sophie's house. Hanna blindly, yet agilely, guided her way towards the English teenager's room, already memorizing the length of the living room. \"Oh, my God!\" Sophie gasped when she turned around to find Hanna at her door, \"What are you doing here?\" Sophie was suppose to open her window for Hanna to come inâ€¦ \"I came through the window,\" said Hanna. \"You broke my window?\" Sophie asked, incredulously. When Hanna nodded, Sophie gasped, \"Hanna, you are so mental! My dad would have a heart attack when he sees it and who's done it.\" \"Will you have to tell him?\" Hanna asked as her pale, blonde eyebrows knitted, troubled. Sophie laughed, \"Of course I'm not going to tell him!\" She smirked at Hanna, \"Rather, I think it's brilliant.\" Hanna smiled with relief. \"Now about that fugly robe you've been wearingâ€¦\" Sophie places a finger on her chin. Glancing at the time, she blindly grabbed some jeans that were too short for Hanna and a random t-shirt. They were running a bit late to meet the boys. And without looking, Sophie took the pink tutu and gave it to Hanna, rushing out the window. The Spanish boys' names were Feliciano and Jose. The girls met up with the boys around a playground area that was close to Sophie's house. Both of the boys brought their motorcycle. Hanna rode with Feliciano while Sophie called dibs with Jose who â€“ by the way â€“ was the hottest man ever to walk in Junior year, according to Sophie. \"Are you scared?\" Feliciano asked Hanna as they rode down the empty streets. They all weren't wearing helmets, making a much more daring experience which made Sophie excited. Sophie squealed in excitement at how fast they were riding. \"Of what?\" Hanna asked and smiled as the wind passes through her hair and on her face. She closes her eyes and breathed in the air, enjoying every second of the freedom. Feliciano smiles, quickly taking a liking to the oddly dressed German girl. The boys brought Hanna and Sophie to a Spanish bar and grill, saying it was Feliciano's uncle that owned the grill. The uncle greeted the girls happily and told the teenagers they were hosting a small bonfire in the back where there was bound to be traditional Spanish music and dancing. Sitting around the small fire, Hanna witnesses the Spanish culture and watches in awe at how fun everyone was having. Music. A combination of sounds with a view of beauty of form and expression of emotion. Feliciano glances at Hanna and smiles at how the girl was enjoying herself. The Spanish boy reached his hand to tap the German girl's shoulder to bring her somewhere that was quiet. But just as he touched her shoulder, Hanna grabbed his wrist with a hard grip and stared at his hand. Feliciano blinked and slowly pulled his arm back, leaving Hanna to continue watching the dancing and guitar playing of his uncle. In the corner of Hanna's eyes, Hanna saw Sophie leaning towards the other Spanish boy, Jose. Hanna turned her head to look at what exactly Sophie was doing â€“ she wasâ€¦ kissing, was it? Hanna looks at Feliciano, to which the boy quickly notices the direction Hanna was looking at beforehand. He awkwardly smiles and points to a quieter environment since he assumes Hanna were a more reserved girl than her friend Sophie. The German girl quickly glances at Sophie â€“ who was kissing excessively, like she was eating his face , Hanna innocently noted. Sophie catches Hanna's glance and rolls her eyes at the German friend. Sophie mouths, \" go with him !\" Hanna stared at Feliciano. When they moved a few feet away from the dancing group of Spanish music, Hanna and Feliciano sat awkwardly next to each other on a bench. Feliciano discreetly cast a quick glance in Hanna's direction. He was never a ladies' man like his mate, Jose. But he really did want to kiss this quiet German girl. She was his type â€“ blonde, pale... And he really, really wanted to kiss the girl. Feliciano deeply exhaled. So, with this newfound courage, Feliciano scooted closer to the quiet girl. \"Kissing.\" Hanna states, out of the blue, while casting a quick glance to Feliciano. The Spanish teenager blinks. \"Is that what we are building up to?\" \"Would you like to?\" asks the Spanish boy, lowly â€“ casting his eyes over Hanna's lips. \"Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles, and 112 postural muscles. The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle,\" Hanna looks at Feliciano, the action caused their face to come closer, \"because it is used to pucker the lips.\" Feliciano does not reply, rather he very much wanted to kiss the girl. He leaned closer to Hanna and placed his hand on her cheek. And just when he barely grazed her white skin, Hanna throws Feliciano to the ground and holds his head in a tight grip that was found in professional wrestling. \"Hanna! You mentalist !\" Sophie yelled, while holding hands with Jose as they got off the ground to look at Hanna and Feliciano. \"Please tell your friend I just wanted a k iss !\" Feliciano's voice breaks as Hanna adds more pressure onto her elbow that was stabbing his neck, never straying her eyes away from the strange offender that was in her space just earlier. Personal space is very important, Papa taught her. Hanna had no idea who this person was, and he decided to touch her without her permission. \"Hanna!\" Sophie shouts. She thought Hanna was weird but to pull off this stunt when she was not looking, un-fucking-believable! \"Should I let him go?\" Hanna asks Sophie, still alert and holding him down. \"As opposed to what ? Yes , you should let him go!\" Sophie remarked loudly, irritated. Hanna leans in closer to Feliciano, quickly analyzing that he was not a threat if she drew near. \"I am going to go now.\" Feliciano frighteningly replies, \"Okay.\" \"It was nice.\" Hanna sincerely states. Then, she smiles down at Feliciano.[Chapter 4] \"Honestly, Hanna,\" Sophie starts as they walked down the sidewalk towards their neighborhood, \"You are so not right in the headâ€¦ It's a good thing that the bar was close, ain't it?\" They walked around Sophie's house to the English girl's room, the window opened for the girls to slip through. After the girls quietly settled in Sophie's room, they laid on the ground full of blankets and pillows since Sophie's bed would not fit both of the girls. Even so, Sophie and Hanna lay closed to each other â€“ their feet tickling one another's legs. Sophie giggled when she remembered how Feliciano was so shaken with Hanna that he did not want to be alone with her anymore. \"You scared him to his wits! I thought you were going to kill him. Where'd you learn to do that?\" Hanna smiles as she looked at the ceiling of Sophie's small room. \"My father taught me.\" Sophie stares at ceiling, too. \"Hanna?\" The English girl turned her head to look at Hanna. The said German girl turned her body to face the brunette. Their legs touching, rather than just their toes. \"You have friends in the UK?\" Hanna looks at Sophie, \"Are we friends?\" \"Yes,\" says Sophie, \"I like you.\" \"I'd like to have a friend,\" Hanna softly says. \"I mean, you're a freak and everything,\" Sophie rolls her eyes, \"but I like you.\" \"I really like you, too.\" Hanna's toes accidentally tickle Sophie's front calf. Sophie twitches slightly, as her knee was her tickle spot. And she isn't quite comfortable being tickled thereâ€¦ \"Where did you say you were from? Lip-zig?\" \"Leipzig.\" Hanna corrects, \"I lived in Leipzig. Recently.\" \"Haven't you got friends there?\" Sophie asks, curious and intrigued by the strange girl. \"Papa and I travel a lot.\" Hanna closes her eyes â€“ Sophie lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding. \"The Eastern side of Europe. Most particularly, Northern Finland.\" Sophie raises her eyebrows, \"Have you been to all different types of school?\" Hanna opens her eyes to reveal those bright, crystal eyes that shine throughout Sophie's room. \"Papa schooled me.\" \"Oh,\" Sophie breathed, feeling a bit tired. She closed her eyes. \"That sucks.\" \"Can we still be friends?\" Hanna asked, hopeful. Sophie opened her eyes to see Hanna with that innocent glint in her eyes that Sophie seems to see quite clearly at this time of night â€“ or morning. \"Did I say the wrong thing again?\" Sophie shakes her head then smiles. She quietly got up and went towards her book sack. She pulled a bracelet out of its pocket department. Then, she went lay down next to Hanna, this time facing towards her. Hanna sees the geometric designs on the stringed bracelet as Sophie grabs her wrist to tie the bracelet. \"Keep this. It's a friendship bracelet.\" After she tied it on Hanna's wrist, Sophie continues, \"I got it at Morocco last holiday van-trip with my family. Talk about boring, the trip that is.\" Hanna gently touches the bracelet with the most care Sophie's ever seen. Then, Hanna softly says, \"Thank you.\" The blonde looks at Sophie with those blue eyes that seem to look through everyone. Their legs brushing against one another as Hanna slowly leans closer to Sophie â€“ whose heart was rapidly beating. Her eyes closing ever so slowlyâ€¦ Their lips just a breath away. Lips barely , like a feather, brush one another. \"It's the German girl.\" Sophie jumped at the sound of her little brother's voice. Her heart jumped then sped back to her rapid beating from just a moment ago. Hanna barely reacts but her eyes were already aimed at the other sibling of the household. He was standing at Hanna's doorway, which surprised Hanna because she would have heard the door open. \"Miles, get out of my room!\" hissed Sophie while she rubbed her eyes, feeling tired suddenly. \"But, why is the German girl here?\" Miles drowsily asked, confused. He, too, rubs his eyes. Sophie groaned and threw a pillow at Miles, \"Get out!\" \"Ow!\" The pillow landed on his face. He stuck out his tongue, \"I'm telling mum!\" When he saw that Sophie was ready to aim another pillow in his direction, Miles left while slamming Sophie's door. \"For fucks sake!\" Sophie hissed, feeling a headache coming along. Hanna smiles with amusement.[Chapter 5] Sophie woke up to find that she was sleeping on the floor alone. She drowsily got out of her room. She never noticed that her window was wide opened. When she came outside her room, the British girl could hear the teapot steaming. \"Mum! The tea!\" Sophie yelled, annoyed because the teakettle was bugging her the fucking hell out of her. The brunette glances around the small kitchen, \"Where's Hanna?\" She sat herself at the small round table. \"Fixed the controller?\" Sophie's mother runs towards the stove as Sebastian comes from the television room, holding the still-to-be-fixed remote. \"Tea, dear?\" \"I had some, already,\" Sebastian dismisses his wife's offer. He looks at his daughter, \"Hanna? The German girl?\" \"Yes, her . Who else?\" Sophie remarked with an attitude. Sophie's dad stares at his daughter. Sophie gives him a look, \" What ?\" \"Why was the telly room's window-lock jammed open?\" The dad asks, giving Sophie an accusing look while he placed the controller on the table. \"Why are you staring at me, as if I've gone and done the crime!\" Sophie says defensively and took a sip of her mum's freshly brewed tea. \"Sebastian, you can't just off-the-bat accuse Sophie of such indecency,\" Rachel nags her husbands, blowing her cup of hot tea, \"it'll mean we, as parents, don't trust her as much as we should; therefore, it will cause a big drift in our relationships with our children.\" \"Just another thing I've to fixâ€¦\" mumbled Sebastian. He pulled open his yellow manual, \"Anyone speak Arabic? This bloody piece of junk comes from Morocco.\" Suddenly, Hanna opens the door to the house holding a skinned bird from lord-knows-where and slams the dead animal on the table. Hanna â€“ out of breath â€“ smiles with sincere innocence, \"I brought breakfast.\" Her chest heaving up and down like she ran twenty miles. Sophie screams in shock and disgust, \" Gross !\" \"So, Hanna.\" Sophie's father started, \"Where's your father?\" Sophie looks at Sebastian, giving him a face â€“ sick of his intruding and pointless questions towards her new friend, \"Hanna, I could do you a make-over if you'd like?\" \"Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a makeover, sweetie.\" says Sophie's mother. \"Some people don't believe what you do, mum.\" Sophie rolled her eyes for the millionth time, \"Maybe she likes making the best of herself.\" Rachel looks at her daughter, with patience, \"No, Sophie, I just don't believe fourteen year-old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars. It objectifies them.\" Sophie sticks out her tongue, tired of talking to her mum. She grabbed a teacup and poured tea for herself again. \"He is on a business trip,\" answered Hanna towards Sebastian's question, looking at the teacup Sophie was sipping out of. \"In Germany.\" \"Oh. Germany, huh?\" Sebastian stated. Sophie's mother smiles at Miles who has just woken up. The man continued, \"How long will he be gone for?\" \"A few weeks.\" Hanna answered, not really paying to mind Sebastian's incredulous looks of worriedness. She was interested at the strange beverage Rachel and Sophie were sipping. Sophie noticed her stares and offered Hanna her cup. \"Would you like some?\" Hesitant, Hanna nods, \"Please.\" Hanna's eyes lit up when the liquid flowed down her throat. \"It tastes like music.\" \"You're so weird, aren't you?\" Sophie stares, never getting used to the strangeness that is this German girlâ€¦ \"Quite impressed with how you take care of yourself while he's away.\" Sebastian commented, watching Hanna take a sip from his daughter's cup. \"My father encourages me to be independent,\" Hanna sips more of Sophie's tea. Sophie leans on her hands and watches Hanna drink her mum's herbal tea, while listening to the conversation. She snickers when Hanna burnt her tongue when she didn't blow the liquid. \"You see, that's wonderful,\" the Bohemian woman exclaimed, standing up to look over the cooking at the stove â€“ the smell spreading throughout the household, \"I was backpacking at your age.\" Hanna poured more tea for herself whenever she finished the cup. Miles obnoxiously poked Sophie in the side of her stomach to annoy the living hell out of his sister. The brunette smacked Miles' hands away. The mother continued excitedly, \"I spent a heavenly summer, just island hopping around Greece!\" \"Bed hopping around Greece, more like it!\" Sophie's dad quipped while examining the controller booklet. \"What?\" Rachel asked, defensively. \"No, no. It's valuable.\" The husband said, \"Our experience makes us who we are. Isn't that right, kids?\" Hanna nods her head. What the family was going on about was completely different to what Hanna and papa discussed about daily. It was different. Hanna doesn't judge them, rather, she enjoys them very much. Almost as much as this certain drink.[Chapter 6] \"Dad! Just buy a new controller for the telly, you're wasting your time.\" The English teenager watched her dad messed with the device for far too long. Plus, it was pretty sad how he couldn't fix the controller. She walked away from the kitchen table, pulling out her cellphone. \"I could! I could fix it!\" Sebastian exclaimed, not giving up, \"Never buy from sketchy markets, kids.\" The tea was long drained, thanks to Hanna. The animal that Hanna had caught was cooked, and the English family cautiously ate it but ultimately enjoyed it in the end. \"If I could read these bleedin ' Arabic symbols!\" Sebastian scratched his head. Hanna stopped messing with Miles' gaming device, as she glanced at Sophie's dad. She spotted the yellow book full of Arabic writing. \"May I?\" Hanna asked Sebastian, meaning to look at the yellow book. Sophie was sitting in the telly room, which was connected to the kitchen because the house was pretty small. After sending a quick text message to Jose, she looked over to the kitchen where Hanna and her family were, interested. He nodded, confused to what the 17 year old could possible do with a foreign, Arabic manual. Hanna quietly grabs the yellow booklet. Her clear blue eyes quickly scan the pages. A few second later, \"It says to press a red button.\" Sebastian glances at his wife. He, then, looks down at the black device. He turns it over a few times, \"You sure there is a red button on here?\" Hanna flips the pages of the square manual, \"Found under the battery slot.\" \"Hm?\" The English man looks closely at where the batteries would be placedâ€¦ \"Well, lookie here. A red button.\" He pressed the button and placed in new batteries. He angled the controller towards the TV, and it turned the device on automatically. However, the television produced only a static screen of grey. \"Damn cable!\" \"How fabulous!\" Rachel gushed at Hanna's bilingual abilities. \"Sebastian's been losing his mind over that silly thing for days.\" Sophie was impressed, once again by the German girl. Mentally noting that the cable needs to be dealt with, Sebastian looks over at Hanna. \"That's just great!\" Sebastian smiled and laughed, \"Where'd you learn Arabic, Hanna?\" \"I like Arabic very much. It's like Japanese, it's big.\" Hanna places the manual down and continues to play with Miles' gaming device â€“ amazed by its exterior and moving pictures. Sebastian raises his eyebrows at Hanna. This girl is something else â€¦ Sebastian smiles with a sigh when he notices the German teenager was certainly holding Miles' gaming console wrong side down. It was Saturday, and the weather was wet. Sophie was loudly complaining how it was a perfect weekend wasted because the wet weather would kill Sophie's fun mood if she stepped out of the house. Rather, in all actuality, Sophie was really lazy to leave the house that day. The teenage girls were in the telly room, on the strange colored sofa that could barely fit three people at best. Hanna watched with full attention to what Sophie was doing, curious and interested. Sophie notices Hanna looking in her direction after she was done texting Jose and checking her mini-games' progression. The brunette smiles, \"Don't you have a cellphone? This precious thing is, like, my lifeline. Without it, I'd die. \" Hanna's eyes widen. \"No, I've never had one.\" \"Haven't you seen these before?\" Hanna shakes her head. Sophie looks at Hanna with shock and disbelief, turning her torso towards the blonde teenager. \"Never ever?\" Hanna nods her head, solemnly yet still had that clueless aura around her. The brunette's mouth was wide open, shocked. \"Mum! Hanna lives in the medieval times!\" Hanna was caught by surprise with Sophie's reaction and shouting. Miles pretended to be sword fighting when he heard Sophie shouted about medieval times. \"I have a romantic view of those simple times,\" Rachel says, writing notes on the European map, \"chamber pots and all.\" Sophie stares at Hanna, incredulously. \"You're really odd.\" Hanna blinks, not sure what to say. Sebastian, who was fixing the mysteriously jammed window, lectures Sophie how that is very rude but the teenager ignored her dad. Sophie, then, remembers how Hanna was homeschooled â€“ and God knows how weird those kids are! The English teenager pulls out her phone, \"But it's fine, I guess. Look.\" Sophie scoots closer to Hanna on the worn-out sofa, turning on her touch-screen device. Their knees bumping into each other's, Hanna unnoticeable twitches by the sudden contact. However, Hanna watches, in astonishment. Sophie presses her fingers on the lit-up screen. \"Cool, huh? I can talk to people, like, instantaneously. Or send pictures, with a few tapping here and there.\" The English teenager looks at Hanna who was watching Sophie's every moment like a puppy. The brunette raises her eyebrows, finding Hanna's expression really adorable. Sophie taps on a certain area and lifts her phone at Hanna's direction. And snaps a picture of Hanna looking clueless. Sophie laughs and continues to snaps more picture of Hanna looking lost. The German girl grabs a hold of the rectangle device and examines the screen. Hanna heard about telephones when she and her father were in Spain; her father had read about it to her. Alexander Graham Bell was credited with inventing the first telephone. Hanna even seen a picture of a telephone, but this rectangle device in her hand was not what she saw. Hanna lifts the phone up and was sincerely excited to see that the cellular telephone was like a telescope. She could see Sophie through the device. \"I can see you,\" said the German teenager, smiling. \"Duh, it's a picture-phone. You know, a camera and a phone, put into one. Every kid in grade school has it.\" Sophie rolls her eyes, \"It's like you've lived in the forest all your life.\" \"Yes.\" Hanna simply replies, distracted. Sophie blinked, caught off guard with Hanna's straight-cut affirmation to her rhetorical statement, which turned out to be true... Not noticing Sophie's stunned silence, Hanna pressed a red symbol on screen, managing to take a picture of a surprised Sophie. The blonde smiles and continues to press the red symbol; she liked the sound it made every time she pressed the red symbol. The German also liked how Sophie looked in the small device, thus she made it her priority to snap as many pictures of Sophie in the device. Then, Hanna aims it at every direction of the telly room and took a still-picture of every spot around her. She took a picture of Sebastian walking out of the house to look at the window from outside, Rachel singing a tune produced by a small machine, and Miles trying to plug a wire into the wall for his bigger gaming device. \"Hey!\" Sophie says, \"You're wasting my memory!\" The English girl tries to snatch her phone away from Hanna, but Hanna skillfully and instinctively dodges Sophie's invading hands. Sophie moves towards the phone since it was out of her reach, while annoyed with the blonde teenager. Hanna continues to take pictures, not really paying attention to Sophie, because Hanna was really enjoying the small rectangle device and how it could still movement and save it in the phone. Sophie growled in annoyance as she grabbed Hanna's shoulder to make it more accessible to reach the device. Sophie put all ounce of her body weight on Hanna â€“ which made Hanna's torso twists towards Sophie â€“ to reach the touch-screen phone. \"Hah!\" Sophie victoriously shouted, grabbing her phone from the pale girl's hand. The English teenager notices that she had a few new text messages. Sophie glances down at Hanna, \"Jesus Christ, Hannâ€¦â€“ \" The brunette stops her sentence when she realizes the closeness of Hanna's face. Sophie notices the pale freckles on the German girl's nose and the scarce dark blonde hairs on her eyebrows. Hanna stares up at Sophie from the angled position they were in â€“ Sophie was practically on Hanna's chest. The English teenager was frozen at her spot for some odd reason. Maybe it was because of Hanna's clear, strikingly blue eyes. Or maybe Sophie just wanted to examine Hanna's face a bit more. Either way, Sophie was still on top of Hanna. Sophie could not tell what Hanna was thinking â€“ the girl was emotionless, most of the time â€“ but Sophie could tell that Hanna's face was coming closer and closer each second. The blonde teenager was leaning up, closer to Sophie's face. All Sophie could hear was the sound of someone's obnoxiously loud heartbeat. It surely wasn't hers, no siree! But the sound grew louder and louder as Hanna slowly leans closerâ€¦ The noise of a gunshot awakes Sophie from her position, making her jump back to the other side of the sofa. Hanna immediately reacts to the noise by casting her eyes to where the sound was coming from. The gun noise being produced was coming from a square box â€“ was it a \"telly,\" that they called it? Like when Sophie showed Hanna her cellular phone, Hanna's attention laid on the television and the gaming device Miles was playing with. \"Miles, turn it down a notch!\" Sophie's father demanded, never turning away from the window. \"I could hear it out here, and boy, was it loud! Nearly gone deaf.\" Hanna decides to sit next to Miles on the ground, watching the English brother play his gaming console. Hanna sat, next to Miles, bemused. She would look between Miles and the screen â€“ alert and cautious whenever there was a shooting on the screen. \"You caught the sickness, Sophie?\" Sebastian asked, glancing at his teenage daughter through the window, \"Your face is as red as your Uncle Ellis during News Years morning when he's drunk a load.\" Sophie sat clinging to the sofa's armrest, dumbfounded and really rather hot. A/N : Hanna's a secret genius isn't she? But, yeah, pretty boring, build-up chapter, but these next couple chapters will be fun. Sorry for the long pauses in updating this story. The only blame is myself, since I have these on and off inspirations, but I will finish this story. Anyways, stay tune people![Chapter 7] \"Since your father is away,\" Sophie smiles with mischief, \"you're totally allowed to do whatever you want, right?\" Hanna sips her chocolate milk. \"I think so.\" The English teenager gleefully claps her hand, causing Hanna to look at Sophie. \"Great! What say we go to that Friday party everyone's been talking about, where alcohol is involved! And tons of cute boys. Jose's coming. Oh! Even his cousin, Feliciano.\" Sophie smiles with a knowing look at Hanna, \"Rumor has it Feliciano's been asking about you.\" The English teenager pops a French fry in her mouth, \"F.Y.I that boy is one tough nut to crack, if you know what I mean. For years, Paula tried asking him out but he just wouldn't budge. Paula's a romantic.\" Hanna grabs a fry from the plate. The girls were in a fast-food restaurant. Sophie had skipped lunch during school and dragged Hanna along when she had spotted her in the school's hallway at the end of school hours. But, it wasn't like Hanna had some place to go. The German girl enjoys the company of the English teenager, very much. \"I don't know what you said or did to that boy, but he's like a lovesick puppy now. Maybe he likes it rough, like, BDSM, Femdom, and rough kinky stuff.\" The English teenager winks at her German friend and offers her a French fry. Hanna happily takes the fry, not exactly sure what candy Sophie was talking about. BDSMâ€¦ Femdomâ€¦ Kinkyâ€¦? \"So?\" Sophie asks with expectance. \"Wanna come or what?\" \"Okay,\" says the blonde girl, continuing to sip her chocolate milk. Hanna really likes it whenever Sophie's eyes would smile whenever Hanna would agree to do things with Sophie. It made Hanna want toâ€¦ be closer to the English girl. It was finally Friday, and Hanna and Sophie were getting ready to go to the big party. Sophie's parents aren't aware of such a late gathering, because Sophie's dad would have a fuss about it and would, then, not allow Sophie to go. It was too much of a bother to tell the parents, so that's why Sophie and Hanna were going to sneak out. \"I don't know why I'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me.\" Sophie says while applying makeup on Hanna. \"Maybe even Jose would not want me anymore.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Though quite frankly I don't need more digits than I've got right now.\" Sophie brags, maybe telling the truth â€“ maybe not. \" Tons. Tons and tons of boys' cellular digits.\" Hanna watches herself in the mirror on Sophie's desk. Black ink over here eyes, strange thick substance over her lipsâ€¦ Almost a woman, but it doesn't look right on her. She licks the lipstick and sees her true lips, \"It's like paint.\" \"Don't lick it off.\" Sophie nags, her eyes lingering on Hanna's lips. She finishes Hanna's face and looks at her in the mirror, \"You're pretty. You know that?\" Sophie says, fully examining Hanna. Sophie did like her work, but personally and deep inside of her, she liked Hanna without the makeup. However, she quietly admires her amateur makeup work and Hanna's prettiness. \"Am I?\" Hanna asks, still staring at the stranger in the mirror. \"Of course you are.\" Sophie states matter of factly, \"You've got pretty eyes and you're tall. I always wanted to be tall. If you were a man, I might fancy you.\" The brunette laughs, joking possibly â€“ Sophie wasn't sure. \"I'm not a man,\" replies Hanna seriously. Sophie laughs even more, while walking towards her closet. \"Does your wardrobe only consist of big Djellaba and orange jumpsuits?\" Sophie looks with disgust at Hanna's attire. \"It's a lot like you're screaming ' off-limits ' to the boys.\" The brunette looks through her closet, catching Hanna's confuse stare. \"You know. Like quail or lesbo. Muff muncher or kitten charmer.\" Hanna briefly glances at her orange sleeves then at Sophie, mildly puzzled, \"What?\" After fitting Hanna into a much better looking attire, Sophie called her friend, Susan, to pick up her for the party. Susan â€“ an English teenager with dyed black hair and neon rainbow highlights with an attitude to match it â€“ arrived at Sophie's neighborhood with a shiny, new vehicle. Hanna thought the vehicle could not hold more than two people, but it turns out that it could. They were certainly in the car, driving around the corners here and there â€“ slowly reaching their destination. Hanna could not follow the English girls' conversation. So, the pale teenager decided to play with the buttons on the door. She was surprised when the glass went down into the door, and Hanna felt the wind blowing. \"Your blondie mate, did her mum dropped her on her noggin, or something?\" Susan asked, while glancing at her car mirror to see the German girl closing her eyes and genuinely enjoying the car wind. Like some mental person. Sophie was applying a bit of cherry lip-gloss, \"She's like that Brian kid in Tech class. Homeschooled.\" The brunette didn't like how Susan was belittling Hanna, but Sue was her BFF since middle school. Sophie changed the subject, \"Say, your dad bought a new car?\" Susan smiles, \"Yeah, you like? I quite think he won't mind me taking it for a spin tonight.\" The girl sharply turns a corner, knowing that the party was near because the sound of electronic music was slowly growing louder. \"Sue, you deviant!\" Sophie laughs, smacking her lips to spread her cherry substance all across her lips. The brunette casts a quick glance to her friend in the backseat. Hanna was still enjoying the night's warm air, her hair blowing back from the wind. Sophie rolls her eyes. They had arrived. Cars were parked all down the street. The house that was containing the party was colorful with bright rays of light and loud music, people were scattered everywhere on the massively large, well-cut lawn. It was obvious that the party not only had high schoolers but college students. Sophie didn't even know the person who was hosting the party, but she did know that the house was fucking huge. \"Oh, my bleeding Jesus.\" Sophie gaps, looking out the window. It was like a world event with all the neon lights. Just the front lawn was like five acres, at best guess. The teenager parked on the curb, away from most of the cars. Her excitement heightens with the thrill of disobedience. Susan was also speechless with the mansion, but shrugged it off, grinning excitedly. \"Sophie, have you got your cell? Keep it on at all times, if you feel like leaving. But, hear good, hey? I'll beat you if you ruin my intimate time with the boys.\" The English friends exchange mischievous smiles. \"Lets fucking party!\"[Chapter 8] Hanna was lost. She had walked in the bright, white building with Sophie and the girl with dyed hair â€“ what was her name? â€“ but, somehow, along the way, Hanna found herself surrounded by faceless people and really, really loud music that Hanna did not really enjoy. She pushed and fought through the crowd, disliking the stench that enamored the sweaty crowds. And how the faceless people were yelling and shouting unpleasantly, for reasons that Hanna could not understand or comprehend. It was all very bizarre to the German girl who has been homeschooled since she was of youth. So, the German teenager was a bit lost. In a huge building. There were plenty of hallways and about forty rooms, all so white and bright. She was walking down a hall with a lot of people scattered in pairs and doing what Sophie was doing to Jose at the Spanish barâ€¦ Eating one's face. Hanna nimbly avoids the couples that were hugging excessively while making strange, throaty noises. The blonde girl walks down the never-ending hall. In front of Hanna was a great, tall door with beautifully crafted decorations engraved in the cream white stone. It was simply pretty, that Hanna slowly traces her fingers over an angel's face. There was noise coming from behind the door. Hanna held her breath, to concentrate on the soft noise. It was music. Not the loud, beeping music coming from down the house where many people were sweaty and on each other, but this music was richer and had a natural sound to it. It reminded Hanna of the guitar instrument, yet not exactly. The German girl tried turning the golden door handle but it was locked. The pale girl, then, decides to lie on the thick carpet to try to fully capture the sound. Placing her ear near the open area under the door, Hanna found that she did hear the music more clearly. Hanna found this type of music more comforting; she closes her eyes, enjoying the sound. She breathes in the beautiful sounds. \"Hanna?\" Hanna looks up towards the person calling her. It was that boy. He had the earring and dirty blonde hairâ€¦ \"It's me.\" The guy flashes a smile, placing the red cup on a nearby table-stand. \"Feliciano.\" He wipes his hands on his swimming attire. \"Hi.\" Hanna greets, still lying on the ground. The boy fidgets nervously when silence had fallen upon their conversation. \"Um, so. What are you doing?\" His accent shines through his question. \"I saw Sophie near the pool, thought that you didn't cameâ€¦ You don't look like a party person. But, uh, you did came.\" He glances at Hanna, alcohol making his face warm â€“ or was he blushing? â€“ he mumbled, \"Do you wanna go outside? I mean if you want. The house is pretty big and stuffyâ€¦\" \"It's a very big house.\" Hanna brings herself off the carpet, missing the sounds of the rich music. \"Can we find Sophie?\" Feliciano blinks and smiles. He didn't think that Hanna would talk to him after what happened at his Uncle's bar. His embarrassment at the bar caused him to avoid Hanna but he felt drawn to the girl. \"Okayâ€¦ uh, sure! She was with Jose and Susan, playing bear pong.\" He laughs, grabbing his cup of alcohol and leading the way, \"My cousin can get a bit weird when he's drunk.\" After a long walk through the house with Feliciano's awkward glances, Hanna and Feliciano had found the place where Sophie and other people were playing Ping-Pong. Hanna thought the smell was a bit overwhelming to her sensitive nose. Hanna decided to leave the small garage where they were playing the 'bear pong,' due to the smell. Fortunately, the German girl had found a secluded area behind the well-kept bushes near the garage. The loud music was giving Hanna a headache, and the people screaming and laughing were no better. The terrible noises combined into a terrifying crescendo. \"H annaaa !\" Sophie called, a bit loudly and hysterically. Hanna did not mind Sophie's voice, it was different. It was, surprisingly, calming. The German turns around to see that Sophie was wobbling her way towards the German girl. Hanna quickly walked up to the English teenager before the brunette tripped on her own feet. The blonde was confused and cautious, seeing that Sophie was a bitâ€¦ not focused, \"Are you sick?\" \"I don't feel sick.\" Sophie giggled. \"I feel absolutely fuck -tastic-fun!\" The brunette encircled her arms around Hanna, embracing her and bringing Hanna closer to her heated, alcohol-induced body. Hanna tensed up, because she wasn't use to physical touching like hugging. Hanna and her father didn't hug often, and it shows through Hanna's defensive, tense stance. \"God, don't be so upâ€¦ â€“ \" Sophie hiccupped and placed her face in the crook of Hanna's neck, \"uptight, like pruny Paula when she sees people in birthday suits!\" Hanna awkwardly stands there as Sophie hugs her, but when Sophie starts to push all her weight on the German girl, she held the English girl up with her arms. The English teenager starts to hum the obnoxious music from the party, going along with its beeps and traumatizing beats. \"What do you call this music?\" Hanna asks, curious to know what it is. Most likely to avoid it in the future. \"What?\" Sophie shouts, not catching what she said. The music blaring and increasing as the night goes on. Hanna leans closer to Sophie's ears, \"What is this music called?\" Sophie smiles at Hanna from the crook of the girl's neck. She turns her head and whispers into Hanna's sensitive ears, \" Banging .\" Sophie's breath smells like the party. The German girl gingerly nods her head, shivering when Sophie's breath tickled her ear. But, the name, it was fitting. The people would get lost into it, and they would jerk violently to this sound. It was actually pretty humorous to watch the people dance to this 'Banging' music. \"Hey Hanna, you're really, really, really pretty,\" Sophie slurs. She nuzzles Hanna's neck, causing Hanna to twitch. But slowly, Hanna grew more comfortable with Sophie's invasion-of-Hanna's-space, and she came to really like Sophie's arms around her â€“ so, Hanna tighten her arms around Sophie's waist, not really liking the smell of the drink on her English friend but genuinely enjoying her touch. \"I fancy you, even if youâ€¦ ain't a man.\" The English teenager giggled and lifted her head towards Hanna's face. She placed a soft kiss at the corner of Hanna's painted lips, leaving a cherry mark on the pale of Hanna's skin. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own anything, yo. Are We Going To Kiss Now? The first thoughts of Hanna were so"},{"Movie":"Lake House","Title":"They Were Meant For Each Other","Author":"hansolofan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3211015","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hi! I usually do Star Wars and Indiana Jones fics, but the Lake House was such a wonderful, beautiful movie that I want to write on that too. This fic is rather lengthy, but please bear with me and read through it. Then click that little button at the bottom of the page and review! Sandra and Keanu rock! Entry I Feb 13, 2006 Today I received another letter from Alex. He said he would wait for me for two years and 1 day, he wouldn't mind at all. As long as he could meet me. I hate this cruel act of fate, to put us 2 years apart. We can't even meet! Even he exists as a distant memory, or he waits two years. Well, at least Fate created the mailbox, our only means of communication. I really pity him. Just for me, he has to wait for two years, while to me, it's only one day. If Fate had to, just had to put us apart, it should've put me in 2004; him, 2006. Then I would suffer instead of him, but I don't mind. Because I love him. I really don't know why. I still remember that day in 2004, when I turned 32. Morgan had organised a birthday party for me, somehow managing to invite a whole lot of people as well as my relatives. One of them was Alex. Obviously I didn't know that 2 years later, I would be writing to him almost everyday, and thinking of him almost every waking moment. But I liked him then. He had dark hair, deep, brown eyes and a really amazing, somewhat impish smile. He had been so charming, so gorgeous. I realize I probably sound like some adolescent thinking of a first love, but really, because of his words, because of his looks, because of his smiles, I love him. I had offered to dance with him then, I don't know why. It occurred to me that that party was arranged by Morgan, for me, if he saw me dancing with another man...that thought crossed my mind for a fleeting moment, but vanished as Alex grinned and took me in his arms. It felt so wonderful; even now, I can remember the feel of his sleeve against my skin, his arms encircled loosely around my waist. Morgan never kisses me, or hugs me, and rarely displays any affection. He is always so absorbed in his work that he hardly has time for me. Alex and I danced in the fading moonlight, then as the song, This Never Happened to me Before by Paul Mccarthney, neared its end, I lifted my head and gazed at him. Then we kissed. His lips were against mine; his hand rested on my hip. I heard my blood thunder in my ears and threaded my hand through his hair. That kiss was passionate, poignant, bittersweet; bitter because we each had our own lovers( or something like that, at least), sweet because for the time being, we didn't have to care about that at all. That kiss had a great impact on me, and I remember every detail. After I started writing to Alex, it became even more meaningful, and memorable. I don't know why I believe that's him. Maybe I just want to. The only proof--if that's what it's counted as--is his word. For all I know he might be an old, wizened man, with ten children and eight dogs, writing just for the sake of doing so. Or worse still, he could be some six-year-old who borrows his father's fountain pen and some sheets of light blue deckered paper just because he wants to win a dare. he might not even be a 'he'! But he sounds so sincere, and I can't wait to meet him tomorrow, to talk to him, to eat with him, to finally sit opposite him and gaze into his eyes after two agonising years. I really hope he waited, and that he's that nice guy oozing laconic charm that his letters portray him as. Kate Forster Entry II Feb 14, 2006 Suddenly, I'm afraid. What if he doesn't like me? What if, in those two years, he had found another girl, and he was going to tell me that three hours later? What if he didn't even wait for me? He arranged for us to meet at Il Mare, this lovely French restaurant in downtown Chicago. I heard they have lovely seared foie gras and escargot is their specialty. It is really expensive though. Alex is clearly out to impress me, and I'm not sure if that's a good sign. I've already decided to wear later. I had chosen it yesterday, after I had read his letter. It's bright red, and quite--how do you say it--wide at the shoulders, exposing quite a fair amount of flesh and cleavage. Okay, maybe I'm out to impress him too. I really want it to go well. I want to see him later, handsome and dapper. I want to muse over the menu with him, our heads bent, so close that they almost touch. I want to eat while talking to him, gazing at him, at that face so familiar though I last saw it two years ago. After that, I want to feel his hand over mine, and squabble with him over who to pay the bill, only to have him decline politely, always the chivalrous guy, and insist on paying himself. I want him to hold my hand as we walk towards the carpark, to give me a goodbye kiss and tell me that he really enjoyed himself. I really want all that to happen. It's been so long since i've felt like this. My love for Alex, even though i have only met him once, grows at an incredible rate. I haven't had a serious relationship for a long time, except Morgan, of course, although i don't really consider it so. It's one-sided liking, definitely not mutual; personally, I think he's rather horrible. He is only pleasant when around me, other than that, he's fussy, bossy and childishly petulant. Because of that, our 'relationship' is hardly progressing, not that i want it to. But for Alex, it's different. When I think of him, this pleasant feeling wells up inside me, and the time he kissed me comes back to me in flashes of memory. I have to get ready now, so I can't write any more. Kate Forster Entry III Feb 14, 2006 It's half-past seven, he was supposed to arrive half an hour ago. To get my mind off him, I'm scribbling furiously on my napkin with a pen the maitre'd so kindly provided me with. I can't believe he's not here yet! He promised; he said he wouldn't mind waiting two years; he seemed so desperate to see me! Yet he's not here! Oh god, I need to calm down, a lone tear just trickled down my cheek and landed on the table and there's this idiot at the next table casting covert and somewhat lascivious glances at me, making me feel uncomfortable. It's only seven-thirty, I know how bad the traffic is in Chicago, he might be stuck in a jam somewhere, impatiently glancing at his watch now and then while trying to rush here. I have to be patient. He will come. He has to come. Kate Forster Entry VI Feb 16, 2006 I waited, until about nine. He didn't come. It's obvious that he isn't serious about this, isn't serious about me. I just wrote a letter to him, ending our relationship once and for all. Now, I just want to forget him, and continue with my life. He has hurt me enough already. Yesterday, I was so miserable. i really thought he had cared, that he would go. Was it really too much to ask for? I was obviously disillusioned. It won't work, and it never will. I cried myself to sleep last night, and at the hospital, I told Anna everything, choking with sobs. She was furious at him, called him a bastard and said other things that made me laugh. I felt a little better, and now I'm calm and composed, ready to forget him. And even though I still think of him quite often, I will forget him, eventually. And I will, I hope I will, go on with my life as if nothing happened at all. People like him, are just not worth thinking about. Kate Forster Chapter 2 will be posted soon, and don't worry, Alex and Kate will be together![Chapter 2] Thanks to Sarah, who has been reviewing almost all my fics. Thank you so much for your support, you're a great friend! Please read and review! Please! Because normally if one of my stories doesn't have a lot of support( reviews, actually) or if it doesn't fare well, I will either stop writing or delete it. I'm considering doing that to this, but it'll be a pity though, since I enjoy writing the Lake House fanfiction. Please review and tell me what you think. Entry V Feb 15, 2008 I chanced upon this pack of papers when I was looking for a leash I'm sure I bought for Jack but mysteriously disappeared. It's tied together with the letters I exchanged with Alex, and had just sat in the corner of the dark, gloomy attic collecting dust for two years. It's quite an interesting experience looking at these papers that reflected and charted my relationship with Alex, in its early stages, that is, and its abrupt, heart-wrenching end. Well, I'm happy to say that just yesterday, we had, seated at the sofa, read this together. I was still a little stunned then, by what had happened just now and other startling revelations I had just learned of. His hand, resting on mine, caressing it gently, seemed so surreal. Was it really there? Was he really sitting just inches away from me? Or was this just a mirage, a figment of my imagination? I wonder if he knows that his mouth moves almost subconsciously as he reads. When he read Entry IV, and my heart constricted, making me feel a familiar pang of pain, he turned to me. I looked into his eyes. They were large and expressive, seeming to reflect sorrow, happiness, and ultimately, love. He apologized. \"It's not your fault. Please don't say that.\" I smiled, intertwining my fingers with his. He smiled back at me. We kissed again, just like before that, when it seemed like we would never stop. I felt elated and contented, a feeling of satisfaction that I had never felt before rose inside me. Jack barked all of a sudden, and I jumped, turning a little to look at her. Her leash dangled from her mouth. My smile widened, if that was possible. What a clever dog, for her to find it herself. Alex was still nuzzling my cheek gently and I turned back to him. We kissed again, then I pulled away. \"Let's go for a walk,\" Alex said, voicing out what was in my mind. I agreed. \"But I have to change first.\" I said, smiling. I think that was the first time I smiled so much and so sincerely. I walked into my room, turning to close the door behind me. After pulling on a pair of dark blue trackpants and a lavender t-shirt, I put on a pair of earrings and walked out. Alex was standing at the window, his back to me. I followed his pensive gaze. The thing that had captured his attention was a tall, bright green tree. It seemed radiant, hale. It reminded me of the time I told Alex that I missed it, not knowing that he would promptly send one over to the patch of grass outside the window of my apartment. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it, delighted, actually; not only because of its mere presence but rather because Alex had cared, had loved me enough to bring a tree or a seed or whatever form it was in all the way from the quiet outskirts of Chicago to the busy, bustling downtown district, just for me. \"I love that tree,\" I informed him as I stepped forward. He turned around, startled, and smiled warmly at me, opening his mouth to reply. \"I love the tree you planted for me too.\" I added. \"Good. At least I didn't drive it all the way there and plant it for nothing.\" He said. I bent down and picked up Jack's leash. Alex took my other hand and we walked out. As we walked, we talked. He asked me about my life, my job, my 'boyfriend', my dog. He wondered why Jack was called Jack although she was female. I told him that it was because I didn't know her gender at first, and didn't think of checking, since she looked so aggressive and well, male. By the time I found out, the name had stuck. We shared angry words about Morgan and he answered my questions in full pretty frankly, seeming to trust me enough to reveal everything about his personal life. That made my heart swell with joy and without the slightest hesitation I kissed him soundly, on the lips. After a while, we sat down on the grass, staring at the lake, its vast, placid waters. Alex wrapped his arm around my shoulders, pulling me closer. I leaned against him as we looked at the sunset. I had imagined this moment countless times, now that it had actually happened, I was ecstastic. It turns out, when something one wishes for come true, the feeling of joy is even more overwhelming. We sat there, leaning against each other and watched the sky in silence. It was a myriad of colours, a repertoire not only consisting of shades of red but also purple. A large previously blank canvas, became a work of art. We sat there, and enjoyed the sunset together. At moments like those, there was no need for words. Kate Forster Entry VI Feb 16, 2008 Yesterday, I slept with Alex. No, I don't mean I, you know, made out with him or other images that sentence had conjured up in your mind. We just shared a bed, that's all. It's weird, how people always associate sleeping with someone to having sex with that person, which, in my opinion, is quite an erroneous misconception. Does that mean that if two people of the opposite sex sleep together, they will end up having sex. Okay, maybe that's true for normal cases, but not for Alex and I. He's not the kind that goes out with hot chicks or has one-night-stands on a regular basis. He hasn't made any advances at me, except to kiss me and say that he loves me, that's all. Which shows that he's not in this for the sex and that me being beautiful( that's what he said, but I think he's wrong, of course) is not the main reason he loves me. I guess that's why I love him. He's different, in a good sense. Anyway, on the way back after dinner in the city, I asked him if he could stay at the lake house with me tonight, instead of going back to his apartment. He looked stunned, and my cheeks burned and I sorely regretted my visceral actions. He soon regained his composure and agreed. I could almost hear a hint of joy and doubt in his reply. Where was he going to sleep? I'm sure that question lingered in his mind, but he managed to restrain himself. I thanked him for agreeing gratefully. Well, the truth is, I asked him to do so because I was scared. Scared to wake up and find out I'm still the lonely, unsignificant person I was in 2006. Scared to go to his apartment and find that he had somehow went back to 2006 and that I would not be able to meet him. Scared that I would never be able to see him again, that I won't be able to hold his hand, kiss him, breathe in the musky scent he always seems to possess. Once we reached there, I changed into a nightgown, while Alex had a drink. The garment I wore was lavender, and was my favourite one. When I walked into the room, he looked surprised. Then he smiled, the smile I had gotten used to and loved, and said that I looked beautiful. That flattered me, I admit and I opened my mouth to reply when he leaned forward, cradling the glass in his hands, and looked at me quizzically, \"So where are we going to sleep?\" \"Uh...\" To tell the truth, I haven't really thought of that. \"I'll sleep on the couch and you can sleep on the bed.\" There was actually another bedroom in the house, but since no one else lived with me, I had converted it to a study and mini library, so that was out of question. \"No,\" Alex objected. \"I'll sleep on the couch, and you can sleep on the bed.\" I shook my head firmly. \"But I live here, so that means you're the guest, so you have to sleep on the bed.\" My words were accompanied with an insistent glare, but he merely laughed. \"You look cute like that. No, I won't sleep on the bed, you're the lady, so you can sleep on the bed.\" We stared at each other, then at the same time, we rushed for the couch. Alex got there first, and I ended up on top of him. We laughed, and I clutched his hand. Then I was suddenly aware that his nose was barely inches from mine, and that I was sprawled on top of him, on a couch. I stopped laughing, and so did he. There was a viscous, awkward silence, but I made no move to get off. Well, I kind of liked it there. Then he seemed to make a decision, and he kissed me, pulling me even closer than before. I felt a warm feeling of pleasure, but after a while, I pulled away. Swallowing, I haltingly suggested,\"Alex, why don't we...\"my voice trailed off. \"Why don't we what?\" he asked, evidently puzzled yet hopeful as well. I stared at him. Oh my God, he's gorgeous. \"Why don't we sleep together on the bed, I mean, not that kind of sleep together, just...\"My cheeks flamed. \"Okay, if that's alright with you,\" he replied easily. He took my hand and led me there. I lay down and switched off the light. Feeling his arm wrap around me, I tensed, just a little. But he noticed it, and paused. I shifted closer to him, and in the end, I fell asleep in his arms, dreaming of him the entire night. Kate Forster[Chapter 3] I'm in a pretty good mood today- my internet connection finally came back on and my results were pretty good- so I'm posting two chapters at one go. Hope you guys don't mind. Please read and review! oh and thanks to all my reviewers, you guys are the best! Entry VII March 10, 2008[Chapter 4] Entry X March 14, 2008 Alex Wyler. That's a nice name. There's some kind of ring to it, and it completely suits him. To me, after I heard of Alexander the Great and his kingdom Macedon, there's some kind of heroic connotation to it, and I envision a tall, handsome man with fair hair, with a gentle but firm demeanor and a great sense of humour. And all those very desirable qualities can be found in Alex, except that his hair is dark, not fair, which is not necessarily a bad thing, considering I can't imagine him with yellowish or straw-coloured hair. I seriously don't know what's wrong with me. When I woke up this morning, I immediately saw Alex's face grinning at me, which, I tell you, is honestly creepy. Then as I showered, I wondered what he was doing then. And as I ate and got ready, I thought about him, his face, his expression, what he looks like when he's angry, sad, or when he professes his love for me, every subtle nuance of his face. What's more, I'm writing this in the morning sitting in the car in an attempt to get my mind off him, only to find that I can hardly think of anything else to write about. This is completely crazy. If this is what love is supposed to be like, I really understand those people who swear they will never get involved in a relationship. Although it's, well, frustrating to be thinking about him the whole morning, at least he's good-looking. I really have to get going now, or I'll be late. Kate Forster Entry XI March 15, 2008 Alex came to look for me yesterday. Apparently he wasn't sure which department I was in, so he found out the time my lunch break is from Stacey at the counter. Then, Stacey said, he came back and requested ever so politely that she tell me that he's waiting at the waiting room. He was a tall, good-looking guy with dark hair and 'smoky eyes', Stacey said, grinning slyly, and all the women below forty were asking if he was available. \"Do you know him?\" Stacey asked. \"Uhâ€¦I think so.\" I started towards the door of the waiting room. \"Is he your boyfriend?\" Stacey called. My boyfriend? To tell the truth, I had never thought of him that way. I paused, my hand on the doorknob. Smiling mysteriously at Stacey, I turned and went in. It was Alex, after all. He stood up when he saw me, tangibly relieved. The room was empty except for him. He was wearing a white, button-down shirt, his tie loosened. He really did look gorgeous. Starting forward, he crushed me into a hug, surprising me. \"Are you alright, Kate? I was worried about you after yesterday.\" I nodded. \"uh-huh, you really cheered me up\" I smiled gratefully. I really was feeling a lot better that morning. \"That's good.\" \"You look really handsome today.\" I said, teasingly. He ducked his head, running his hand through his hair, embarrassed. \"Well, I just happened to get good genes.\" We laughed, and he pulled me to him to him for a kiss. His hand circled my waist, pulling me even closer as his lips moved almost imperceptibly. I kissed him back, enjoying myself immensely. At that moment, the door opened and I heard a voice I recognized as Anna's. \"Kate? Stacey said I'll find youâ€”Oops! Sorry!\" I hurriedly pulled away, feeling my face redden. \"Wait, Anna, it's okay. Uh, this is Alex.\" \"Oh! So this is Alex,\" she shook his hand, grinning at me. \"All the ladies outside were gushing about how charming you are.\" Before Alex could respond, Anna continued, \"Well, I'll leave you two alone then. Ta-ta!\" She breezed out of the door. I could see from the little rectangular window on the door that as soon as Anna stepped out, an excited posse of girls surged forward, hounding her with questions. \"Oh no.\" Alex said, sounding bemused. \" You're nicer and more beautiful than any of them, why should they bother?\" I gasped, shocked. \"No, I'm notâ€¦\" \"Aw, come on, stop denying it. You wanna go for lunch with me?\" I nodded, trying not to appear too eager. \"Great, come on, let's go.\" He slipped his hand around my waist and we walked out of the door together. Kate Forster Entry XII March 20, 2008 I've been really busy lately, with hardly any time to write here. Alex has got a big project too, so we hardly meet. His brother, Simon, told me that he's clocking over twelve hours a day, and from his voice over the phone, I can tell he's really exhausted. I miss him, frankly speaking, and I wish he'll take some time to rest before he falls ill. But when I tell him that, he assures me, quite convincingly, that he does, and that he's absolutely relaxed, no pressure at all. Then he thanks me for my concern, said that he really needs to get back to work now, and that he loves me. Recently, I called and checked on this patient I used to have. Her name is Andrea Davis, and she was only twelve when I became her main oncologist. Leukemia had wrecked her, making her look emaciated and weary perpetually, but she still maintained a cheery manner. She was diagnosed when she was five, but had been fighting tirelessly all these years. At a certain point after chemotherapy, she contracted pneumonia and was put in the intensive care ward. It seemed like this time, she wouldn't make it, that ironically, she would not die in the hand of the illness that had been tormenting her for seven long years, instead, it was another illness she had contracted in the course of treatment that would destroy her, take her life. And there was nothing I, or any of the other doctors, could do about it. I told Mr and Mrs Davis, Matt and Alice respectively, one night. \"Andrea is not taking this very well. As you know, chemotherapy made her extremely vulnerable to any other illnesses, so right now, she's placed on a respirator, which is breathing for her right now. The board of oncologists and radiologists held a meeting, and we decided, it's time to let go.\" They looked stunned. Alice clutched her husband's arm. \"Let go?\" she echoed hollowly. \"Are you sure?\" I wish she knew how hard it was for me to give her my one-word answer. Matt patted Alice's hand reassuringly, brushing away tears. \"Do you remember, when she was six, the oncologist at Minnesota said that she would only live one year, at the most? Well, it's been six, you know she's been incredibly strong. The person lying comatose on the bed right now is no longer her. It's an empty husk that used to contain her, but not anymore. \" he said quietly. The next day, they signed the papers to switch the respirator off two days later. The next day, Andrea woke up. I had never believed in miracles. But after I personally saw Andrea open her eyes and say hello weakly to me, I did. Because children, they beat the odds all the time. Her condition improved tremendously after that, and now, she's eighteen and a national debater. I think that showed no matter what, no matter how grave and dire the circumstances, one should never ever give up, just like Andrea. At that time, I realized how lucky I was. And now, I'm even luckier than before. Now, I have Alex. Kate Forster I hope everyone will be patient, since i expect a lot of you guys are bored by now :-). But after all, alex and kate are a normal couple so these kinda stuff will happen on quite a frequent basis. Anyway, the next chapter will be a lot more emotional and well, sad... For now, Please read and review![Chapter 5] Thank you so much once again to all my wonderful reviewers! And to the three reviews who were very alarmed when i wanted to delete this story--please review too! Anyway, i just realized i'm into the fifth chapter of this fic and i have not posted a disclaimer at all. Well, now i'm going to, before someone sues me. :) Disclaimer: the lake house and all associated characters in the movie itself belong to Alejandro Agresti and the crew. And i'm not Alejandro Agresti or the crew. Entry X11 April 1, 2008[Chapter 6] Gosh, i know this is really short...but i wanted to end this thing without adding other things in...those'll come in the next few chappies...anw, hope you like this and pls review:) Entry XVII April 22, 2008[Chapter 7] Entry IIX May 4, 2008 During break today Anna pulled me aside. \"Kate, today is my niece's birthday! You looked after Andrea Davis, right? Well, my niece is eighteen, so can you help me buy a present later?\" 'Sure!\" I replied instantly. Then I frowned. \"I'm not sure what she'll want though.\" 'Oh at least you're not as clueless as me...so let's go the mall after our shifts, kaes?\" How hard could it be anyway, to choose a present for a teenager? Very hard, i later found out. We went to so many shops just to find a perfect present...and in the end, I don't even think we did find it... Manicure shop: \"Jess loves doing her nails, but she probably has all the colours.\" Clothes: \"She's a HUGE shopaholic, but I don't know her size...and no, I can't guess...and what if we buy a piece of clothing that she already owns?\" \"Embarrassing.\" \"Exactly.\" Records shop: \"I don't even know what kind of music she likes!\" In the end, we decided to go for dinner first. As I had a spoonful or noodles, I spotted the bookstore opposite. It spanned the whole level. I hurriedly swallowed the noodles. \"Does she like books?\" \"Yes! She loves them!\" \"Why don't we go to the bookstore later and have a look?\" I suggested. \"I don't really fancy going to another of the twenty-over shops left in the mall.\" We went there and browsed around. After much consideration, Anna decided to buy a book regarding fashion. \"I'll buy this for her.\" I said, holding up a hardcover bestseller. Anna looked shocked. \"No! You don't have to buy anything for her, I just wanted your help that's all!' \"No it's all right, I want to give her a present.\" I persisted. \"Kate! There's no need to!\" Anna was becoming increasingly alarmed. When I showed no sign of changing my mind, she tried a different tack. \"Oh no. I feel sooooo ashamed, Kate, you probably think I asked for your help in the hope you'll got one for her as well...\" \"Oh stop it Anna,\" I dismissed her, grinning. \"Do you think she'll like this?\" After purchasing the books, Anna drove us to her house. The girl who opened the door was tall, with long blonde hair and a slim figure. She shrieked in delight, throwing her arms around Anna's neck. Anna introduced me to her and she hugged and thanked me for the present too. She surveyed me for a moment. \"Kate, will you get me another present?\" \"Jessica!\" Anna admonished, shocked. \"Anna, you'll find this fun too.\" she grinned devilishly and turned to me. \"Will you?\" \"Yes if I can,\" I replied with a great sense of foreboding and trepidation. Her eyes lit up and she pulled me into the house. \"My parents aren't home, and now I'm eighteen, I want to go with the bar with you and Anna!\" I must've looked relieved, because she continued, \"That's not all, Kate. You have to wear what I tell you to do.\" \"What?!\" I exclaimed. \"You promised!\" She waggled her finger at me severely. \"Besides, I just want you to wear this halter-top and mini-skirt. Nothing too skimpy. It'll look good on you!\" \"Nothing too skimpy?\" I echoed faintly. \"come on!\" In the end, I had to wear this light pink halter-top that bared my midriff, and a white mini-skirt that totally defies 'mini'. That was seriously mortifying. Anna looked amused and apologetic at the same time while Jessica was jumping around in barely suppressed glee. At my request (no way was I walking down the road in that), we took a taxi to the bar Anna and I usually frequent. The bartender recognized me and winked. \"Alex gone, huh?\" \"No!\" I hurriedly corrected him. \"He's not 'gone'!' \"She has a boyfriend?\" Jessica asked Anna excitedly. \"Really? What does he look like?\" Anna grinned. \"Well..I think he's quite cute, yeah.\" I glared at her playfully. \"Aw, come on he is!\" Anna insisted. I tucked my hair behind my ear and drank some of the drink Jess ordered. She seemed to know her way around here pretty well...i listened, a little bored, as Jess jabbered on excitedly about all the hot guys. Then suddenly she shrieked. \"Oh do you see that guy coming in with the other guy? He's hot! He's waayyyy too old though...\" Jess drooped a little then perked up. \"Maybe he's gay.\" Anna poked her, not looking in that direction. \"Don't say that! They're probably related or something...\" Jess pouted indignantly. \"You don't have a boyfriend, right? Well he's around your age!\" With a sigh, Anna turned around, then shrieked too. I groaned inwardly. Not her too... \"Kate!\" she hissed. \"It's Alex!\" I stared at her numbly then glanced in that direction. He was walking in with Henry, wearing a white shirt and pants. I glanced around wildly. \"Oh shit! I have to hide!\" \"Oh what's the big fuss?\" Jess asked indifferently. \"Oh he's looking in this direction! Hey!\" She waved her arms wildly, shouting. Anna clamped her hand over her mouth. \"Don't!\" But he had already heard. He glanced in this direction and froze when his eyes met mine. After a moment of him gaping open-mouthed at me, I smiled sheepishly. He grinned, making his way over. \"See what you did?\" Anna hissed angrily at Jess. He came over and kissed me gently on the cheek. \"Hi I didn't know you're here. Hi Anna, and...\" \"Jess. Anna's my aunt.\" she said. \"So you're Kate's boyfriend?\" \"Yeah...which reminds me, that's a rather different attire today huh?\" His eyes roamed over me and I blushed embarrassedly, feeling very cold and bare all of a sudden. \"No it's not me...\" I hastily corrected him. \"It's not me, it's this...this girl.\" I jabbed my finger viciously in Jess's direction. \"Yup!\" Anna piped up. \"Kate agreed to give her something, then she said she wanted Kate to wear that.\" She crossed her legs and sipped her drink. \"Don't worry, your girlfriend is not a slut or anything...\" I elbowed her. \"hey!\" Alex smiled. \"Well that's a relief. Since we're here, do you want to dance? You guys don't mind right?\" \"Of course not! You two go enjoy yourselves...\" With a smile of anticipation, I hopped off the stool. Alex took my hand and led me to the centre of the floor. As we started to dance, Alex leaned to me and whispered, \"I think you look great.\" I blushed. \"I'm not ever going to wear like this again.\" I declared. \"Aw.\" Alex observed playfully. I hit him playfully on the arm. \"Stop it, Alex!\" We continued dancing, pressed up tight against each other. Then the song ended and I gazed at him. He bent down and kissed me tenderly, slowly. His arm came to rest on my back as I gripped him, melting into his arms, tingling all over at his touch. The rest of the night passed in a hazy blur. I remember dancing some more with Alex, drinking some more, chatting with them. And I remember the world tilting crazily around me as I grabbed the table edge for balance. It had been a long time since I last drank; after I met Alex (i mean physically, of course), I didn't find any sorrows I desperately needed to drown. The last thing I remembered before I passed out was Alex's arms around me, lifting me up. I woke up the next day with a splitting headache and feeling grumpy and moody. Gritting my teeth in pain, I got up somnolently and headed blearily to the kitchen. Good thing it was Saturday. I didn't fancy facing work or Anna, for that matter. Oh my god that was so embarrassing! Fainting in front of everyone after all of three glasses. i wonder what Alex thinks of me and my low alcohol tolerance now. ugh. Speaking of which...how did I get here? I remember quite clearly I passed out in the bar. And why was I wearing a dressing gown? I undid the sash and was a little relieved and disappointed to see my clothes were still on. Alex was a gentlemen, after all...but...aw too bad...Gulping down a glass of juice, I noticed a small slip of paper on the dining table, held down by my handbag. Dear Kate, I hope you're feeling alright...honestly i never realized you to faint after just 3 glasses. well anyway in case you're wondering, i put on the dressing gown for you. in case u get cold at night in those clothes you were wearing. yup. and u really should eat more. you're awfully light...but then easier for me to carry you, huh:) love, Alex P.S. do take care of yourself. ppl normally do not faint after just three glasses. maybe u're not well. i dunno...you're the doctor... If you're feeling up to it, wanna go out today? I smiled as I picked up the phone to call him. How could I miss a chance to go out with him? Kate Forster ","Summary":" Hi!

What if Angela was lost after the battle at Praetorian Headquarters? For three years. And what if Elizabeth Marx was still wanted by the FBI, by Jacob's new boss? He would do anything, even risk losing his job with the CIC to find Angela. But can he bring back the real Angela from years of torture or is she fated to be Liz Marx for the rest of her life? WARNING: this is a tragedy. Angela may never be the same again, mentally, after what happens here. It's not pretty. Wrist slashing, rape, beatings, and other bad things are mentioned. You have been warned. If you don't want to read it, that's fine, you can stop here. Comments are appreciated. Constructive criticism is helpful for me as a writer, but flames are not. Thanks! And enjoy the story! Chapter 1 \" We're putting you on an old case,\" Jacob remembered his boss saying as he walked down the sidewalk of the small town. \"You've probably heard of her: Elizabeth Marx, the computer terrorist. She's still on the run from the police, pops up every now and again in some internet chat room and then disappears before anyone can trace her. However, with your computer skills, I'm hoping you can bring her in. Not only that, but I think you could be charming enough to entice her in willingly if need be.\" It had been three years since he'd heard that name, since she'd disappeared. So many bodies had come out of that travel agency. So many without life. And even though Walter Cizelski had taken him in, given him a job working for the FBI, he wasn't allowed to see who any of the bodies belonged to. And no one had mentioned Angela at all. He couldn't see the case files because he'd been involved in the case personally. So whether she'd just disappeared or died Jacob didn't know, until Walter had brought up Liz Marx, unaware that the two were one and the same. Jacob had been sending out coded messages for the past few months that only Angela could read. Only one response had told him she was alive. Nothing more. Yet someone was searching for Sorcerer. Had been for three years. The trail this person left, however, was not Angela's trail. Even if she was trying to hide from someone else, he would recognize her hand print on the searches. Though no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't decode them to determine who it was. Until now. At first the search beacon was strong with no tracks at all. But it was weakening over time, leading Jacob to this small rural town in the middle of Illinois that looked more like something out of an old western with Clint Eastwood. They didn't even have a police station, let alone a hospital or a fire house. A quick flash of his badge in the country store had brought him some answers, even if they were strange. \"I haven't seen it, but they say it's evil! That it'll eat you in your sleep!\" one elderly man said. \"When I said 'anything odd' I didn't mean ghost stories for children,\" the FBI Agent corrected. \"No! Tain't no ghost story!\" a woman exclaimed. \"They keep it chained up like a dog. So's it won't hurt no one.\" \"Where?\" \"Up on the hill. But don't go up there! Please, Mister! It will kill you!\"Children's stories. That's all it was. But he'd go up there and see for himself anyway. What he was looking for wasn't in this backwater town even if the codes had led him here. âœ¢ News had spread fast about this strange man going to see the evil creature chained on the hill. Men, women, and children lined the streets as he walked past. The women crossed themselves and kept the children back, who stared up at him in awe. \"You're crazy,\" the men said. \"You're gonna die up there and we ain't gonna come after ya if'n ya call for help.\" Jacob only nodded and continued down the street towards the old dirt road leading up the hill. When he'd arrived at the top he found a large, well-kept stone mansion that looked so out of place from the western town belowBehind the mansion there was a large dog chained to a pole in the ground. From a distance it appeared to be curled up in a ball, enjoying a late-afternoon nap in the sun. Was this what the townspeople were so afraid of? Jacob let out a small laugh and turned to head back to town when a familiar voice caught his ear. \"Elizabeth!\" He turned to see someone yank on the chain. The dog slowly stood up. On two feet. Jacob stopped laughing and stared as he realized it was a woman. The man took the chain off the thick collar around her neck and attached a leash before they went inside. He was shocked out of his mind, unable to move. So this was what the locals were afraid of? She hadn't looked scary, but why chain her up if she wasn't? He'd come here on business, searching for Elizabeth Marx. He'd also come for personal reasons, to find Angela Bennett. That had been a woman, he'd called her Elizabeth. That voice had been familiar too. But he couldn't place it. \"And who might you be, wandering this far from town?\" Jacob jumped clear out of his skin at the sudden voice and whipped around to see Mr. Olivier, once a higher-up in the Praetorian ranks. With trembling knees, Jacob thanked God none of them knew who he was. \"Didn't mean to scare you there,\" Mr. Olivier said, leaning on his cane. He didn't seem overly evil just then, but he wasn't smiling either. \"No, no, it's ok,\" Jacob worked the puzzle in his mind. \"I'm looking for work, actually.\" \"You are, are you?\" Jacob bit back the fear rising within him. This man was supposed to be dead. Died at the home he'd been sent to in order to deal with his alcohol problems. And if he wasn't dead, then who else wasn't? \"What's your name?\" \"Um, Jones Davey.\" \"Well, Jones, you just call me Mr. Olivier. Maybe we can work something out. What line of work are you interested in?\" \"Anything really. My mom kicked me out and I've got nothing,\" he said, playing off of the fact that he still looked young enough to be a teenager. \"Ah, well then follow me, lad. We'll find ya something I'm sure.\" Entering the mansion, Jacob saw a grand old place turned technological with hand print readers at nearly every door. In his mind he went over the ways to get around retinal scans and hand print readers. Mr. Olivier left him alone in a small room to talk to the higher-ups. The place wreaked of Praetorians, no matter how old fashioned this room looked with its fireplace, couch, end table, and two matching chairs. He'd pushed his biggest fear to the back of his mind, too afraid to even think it, least it come true. But he knew it was. The Praetorians weren't dead by whatever luck they possessed and Angela hadn't been able to change her identity back. He'd found Elizabeth Marx and as much as he was glad he'd found her, he was also afraid for her. If they'd been keeping her this long chained like a dog...His Angel, treated like...He had to put those thoughts out of his mind. Elizabeth was here now, trapped and he was here to get her out. To bring Angela home. He slipped his badge down his pants so that it wouldn't be found. These were the Praetorians and they would take no chances. The door opened and both Mr. White and Sean Trelawney came in followed by Mr. Olivier. \"Did you check him out?\" Mr. White asked, looking back towards Sean. \"I found nothing.\" Jacob was glad the alias he'd created for his last case was working quite well. All three men looked him over for a few seconds before he stood up and introduced himself. \"Hi, Jones Davey. And you are?\" he stuck out his hand. \"Mr. White, Mr. Trelawney, and you've already met Mr. Olivier.\" The Praetorian leader did not return the handshake. \"Our janitor just quit. You take the job and you get a room. Small. But you won't need much. And you won't be able to leave the grounds. Ever. You will have no contact outside and whatever you see here stays here. Got it?\" \"I got it and I'm in.\" Mr. White turned to Sean, \"pat him down and show him what to do.\" Trelawney nodded as the other two left the room. \"You look familiar,\" Sean said as Jacob allowed him to search for weapons. \"I don't know why cause I've certainly never seen you before,\" Jacob said, getting an odd sensation from having his arch enemy pat him down. The enemy he hadn't seen in three years and had not expected to see ever again. How the hell were they all still alive?! \"Though I've been told I have a memorable face.\" Once pronounced clean, Sean lead him out of the room. The place was huge with a maze of hallways and rooms. The walls were a dark wood paneling, the furniture was all dark wood, and any thing else was a dark green. Dark, dark, dark. It was all dark. \"So, what group is this? What's your name? Who do you belong to?\" Jacob asked. Sean looked rather annoyed at having been given this chore as he turned and said \"We're an elite government agency. That's all you need to know.\" \"Ah, the secrecy bit. I get it.\" Sean showed him his room which was so tiny it could only hold a twin bed and a night stand. Only slightly bigger than a closet. \"I certainly hope you're not claustrophobic,\" Sean grinned. After showing him where all the bathrooms and livingrooms were that he'd have to clean Sean took him up to the third floor. \"Whatever you see here, stays here. Got it?\" Jacob nodded as Sean pointed towards two closed doors at one end of the wide hallway. \"And you do not, I repeat, DO NOT go through those doors. You do, and you're dead.\" \"Um, yeah, got it.\" \"The only time you ever come up here is to clean out the dog's cage.\" \"Dog?\" \"Yes. Over here.\" Sean moved a painting of flowers to reveal a small red button high up on the wall. Pushing that button, a bit of dark wood paneling rose to reveal a jail cell-like door leading into a small room, smaller than his. A thin, old pillow and two old blankets covered the floor. The back wall was already lifted to reveal a tile floor and what looked like a toilet from Jacob's vantage point. The sound of a long electric shock and someone moaning made the FBI agent turn towards the double doors as they slammed open against the walls. A woman was on her knees. Mr. White was behind her and he pushed her out into the hall. She fell forward and Jacob was able to see a thick metal collar around her neck. \"Get back to your room!\" Jacob gasped as she stumbled to her feet. Angel! She was so thin and her neck was red and raw where the collar had dug into her skin. As she scrambled towards him and the dog's kennel he saw her eyes no longer bright and welcoming but clouded over, showing a person who'd shut down and shut everyone out. Sean grabbed Jacob's shoulder and pulled him away as he pressed the red button again. The bars rose into the wall and she slipped into the kennel. \"Wait! She's the dog?!\" \"You didn't see that Davey.\" \"I need an explanation here!\" \"She has a mental disorder. She identifies more with the dogs than us humans. Now, you'll want to start at the first floor and work your way up when you clean,\" Sean said, steering Jacob towards the stairs. âœ¢ That night Jacob lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. Flashes of Angela so thin he could see her ribs through her soiled nightgown came flying at him whenever he attempted to close his eyes, and refused to go away. It made him sick to his stomach just thinking of what they had done to her and he didn't think it would ever go away, the sickness, the pictures, the thoughts. For the rest of his life he would remember what they did to her, how they treated her. Even if he was able to get her away from here and to safety. He would always remember, and he would always hate them for it. Always.[Chapter 2] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 2 Uponndunning the navy blue jump suit the next morning Jacob noticed deep,ndark circles under his eyes. \"Youncan't afford the be scared of what you see here,\" Sean said,nplacing a hand on his shoulder. \"Nor can you afford to lose anynsleep. Now get cleaning. I'll be checking up on you throughout thenday. You don't want to quit like the last guy.\" \"Yesnsir,\" Jacob said, remembering his days in FBI training at Quantico. Seannleft and he began his cleaning, starting with the first bathroom onnthe first floor. With his mouth set in a grim line and his eyesnalmost glowing with hatred he cleaned everything until it sparkled innthe light. He toiled all day, scrubbing and dusting. Bynthe time he'd reached the top floor it was already getting dark. Henstood in front of the painting of flowers with a cleaning bucket bynhis side and a rag in his hand. Stepping forward he moved thenpainting and pushed the small red button. The dark wood paneling wentnup and the barred door remained. Inside,nAngela had curled herself into a tiny ball on top of both blankets.nThe moment she saw him she bolted to a corner farthest away from him.nShe regarded him carefully, never taking her eyes away from him. Anhand fell onto Jacob's shoulder and he was pushed to the floor. Mr.nWhite stood there, a cross expression on his face as he put thenpaneling back down. \"Younmust always ask for permission before you clean that. You must notnhave any contact with her at all. Now, go down to the kitchen and getnyour dinner. When you come back up she will be gone and you cannclean. Go.\" Jacobnturned and went to the kitchen as instructed, anger welling up in hisnheart. How could they treat her like that? How could they? The cooknput a bowl and a spoon in front of him as he continued to cook a chopnof lamb for the dinning room table. When he was done eating thengruel, Jacob washed the bowl and spoon and put them away asninstructed by the cook. âœ¢ Thenwood paneling and the metal bars were both up, revealing an emptynplace. Jacob pushed a bucket of soapy water in and crawled after it.nNothing here had been cleaned in a long time. He did his best tonignore that fact as he scrubbed away at the blood stains covering thentiny bathroom floor, sink, and toilet. There was nothing else in thenroom besides a small cake of soap. Not even a hand towel. Thenblankets and pillow case were so dirty Jacob tossed them out into thenhallway while he scrubbed the walls and floor of the tiny sleepingnarea. He then took the dirty blankets and pillow case to the laundrynroom and selected fresh laundry to replace the old. He met SeannTrelawney at Angela's cage, but ignored his loathsome presence asnhe got down on his hands and knees to take the blankets inside andnmake up her \"bed\". \"Whatnthe hell do you think you're doing?\" Sean asked. \"Her blanketsnare blue and those are pink!\" \"Thenold ones were dirty so I put them in the laundry.\" \"Well,nI don't care if they were dirty! Go back and get them!\" Jacobngot up and went. When he came back with the dirty laundry Sean wasnstill there, watching him get back on his hands and knees. As Jacobnpushed the laundry in, Sean hit the red button, making the metal barsngo down onto his wrist. Jacobncried out as he was pinned and a considerable weight was attemptingnto crush his bones. \"Inthink, Jones, that you really ought to quit. Because you're stillndoing it wrong! What are you trying to do?\" \"Justnmaking her bed.\" \"Shencan make it herself!\" Seannhit the button a few more times before the bars let Jacob's wristngo and it was already purple and puffy. A severe kick from Trelawneynsent him flying down the stairs. Hitting the wall with a sickeningncrunch he got back on his feet. He heard shuffling behind Sean as thengoon watched him. \"Getnyour bucket and get out of here.\" Thenwood paneling was already back down when he reached the top of thenstairs. A small patch of soiled blue blanket had caught under thenpaneling and was being tugged on from the inside. Withndowncast eyes Jacob grabbed the cleaning bucket and returned to hisnroom. He sat down heavily on the edge of his bed, his head in hisnhands as tears slipped down his face, soaking his shirt. âœ¢ Hoursnlater, eyes red-rimmed and his wrist still throbbing, he got out ofnbed and snuck back upstairs to face the flowers. Raising both thenpaneling and the bars he saw her scurry into a corner. \"Angel!nCome on, let's get out of here!\" Shensat in the corner, her knees drawn up to her chest, her arms wrappednaround her. She didn't move or talk. \"Angel,nit's me! Come on, we've got to get out of here! Before they catchnus!\" Henstarted to crawl inside to help her out when she pulled her kneesncloser to her body to get as far away from him as possible. Henstopped. Her eyes showed no recognition of him at all. Only fear. \"Angela?\"nhe asked, in a softer voice. \"Do you know who I am?\" Shenonly stared at him. He could see how frail she was, how the thicknmetal collar dug into her skin, making her neck bleed. He wantednnothing other than to hug her, carry her out of this prison to safetynand care for her and tell her everything would be alright. But shendidn't know who he was. Jacobncrawled backwards until only his head was inside. \"I'mna friend,\" he said. \"And I don't want to hurt you.\" Hencringed at having to say these words to her. \"I want to help you.nYour name's not Elizabeth Marx. It's Angela Bennett. And I'mnJacob. Jacob Resh. Your friend. I can't stay long or they'llncatch me. But I'll be back tomorrow night. I promise.\" Seeingnher there, pressed into the corner, afraid of him, afraid of her ownnshadow, pulled at his heart and made him want to kill thosenresponsible for what had happened to her. âœ¢ Backnin his room he had a hard time sleeping again. He knew he would havento take things slow with her, gain her trust over time. And duringnthis time he could figure out a way to kill the Praetorians once andnfor all, and save Angela from this horrid life. Thennext day Jacob flew through his work, ignoring Sean who always seemednto be standing over his shoulder. When dinner time came he ate thenfood quickly and on his way out stole an apple and a roll. âœ¢ Whennhe opened the paneling and the bars that night after everyone hadngone to bed Angela had once again curled up into the corner. Jacobntossed both the apple and the roll in as peace offerings and as extranfood in her small diet. \"Younknow I've been searching for you for three years,\" he said whilenshe grabbed the food and nearly inhaled them both. \"I wish I couldnhave saved you that day, Angel. You don't know the agony I'venbeen in since you disappeared, trying to find you. Do you remembernlife before you came here?\" he asked, wondering if she'dnforgotten that as well as him. She'dnfinished eating and sat huddled in the corner, looking at him butnwith only the remembrance of seeing him the night before in her eyes.nNothing more. \"Well,nyou were once a great computer programmer who'd taken a homelessnwoman, Tilly, off the street and given her a job and a place to stay.nBut then I came along and sent you a message you weren't supposednto see. But you only knew me as Sorcerer back then.\" Atnthe mention of his online identity Angela's demeanor changed. Shenrecognized the name. \"Younknow about Sorcerer?\" Jacob asked, clueless as to why she'dnremember Sorcerer and not the man behind the online mask. Butnshe wasn't going to tell him anything and Jacob was worried thenPraetorians had done something to make sure she couldn't talk.nTears welled up in his eyes at the thought. \"Didnthey do something to you? Can you talk? Please talk to me Angel!\" Whennshe didn't respond he said, \"Angel, I love you, and I would donanything for you.\" \"Gonaway,\" her voice was hoarse and weak, but he heard it. Hensmiled through his tears and thanked God she could still talk. Andnthen thought over the words he'd just told her. And he knew theynwere true. Deep down inside his heart, he loved her. He wasn'tnrisking his job in the FBI for nothing. Looking up at Angela he sawnthat she had grabbed a blanket and wrapped it around her up to hernchin. \"Angel,nI love you. And if I lose my job for saving you then so be it. You'renmore important to me than any job. Than anything. Look, I've got tongo. But I'll be back tomorrow night. OK?\" Whennshe only stared at him he got up and put the paneling back down.nHeading back to his room he thought about how he would break her out.nHe would have to change her identity first then get her out. But innorder to change her identity he would have to find the main computer.nWhich meant he would have to gain clearance to the secure areas ofnthe mansion. âœ¢ Anweek later he was able to enter her cage while she sat in the cornernand ate the food he'd brought her. He'd gotten close, but as henreached out to touch her face she shrank away from him. He took hisnhand away, a hurt look on his face. He talked to her about nothingnimportant. Just talked in as gentle a voice as he could manage. Andnwhen he left he made sure to tell her he loved her, even if shendidn't understand him. âœ¢ \"Ah,nso you must be the new janitor I heard they hired to replace Jack,\"nJacob heard one night while he was eating his dinner. Henturned to see a tall skinny guy grabbing a plate and loading it withnfood. The man sat down and shook hands with Jacob. He was bald, butnlooked a little more respectable than everyone else Jacob knew to benthere. \"Inam,\" he replied. \"Name's Jones. And who might you be?\" \"Oh,nI'm the other janitor. James.\" Jacobnstared at him in surprise. \"What?nYou mean there's two of us? And they don't split up the work morenevenly?\" \"OnlynI'm authorized to view what goes on behind closed doors. A lot ofntimes I have to clean up blood and things. I get the harder, dirtiernprojects.\" \"Blood?\" \"Oh,nit's nothing. Mostly it's just dusting and moping.\" âœ¢ Overnthe next few nights Jacob became closer to Angela. He brought her hisnwhole dinner, preferring to go hungry rather than watching hernstarve. Hisnstomach growled as she shoveled food into her mouth with her fingers,nignoring the silverware that had fallen to the floor. She looked upnat him while she kept eating. Hennodded towards the food. \"That's my dinner. You'll have tonpardon my stomach.\" Shenstopped eating, her hands dropping to her lap. \"Eat,neat,\" he said. \"I've got to take that plate back before theynnotice it's gone.\" Shenlowered her eyes and began eating again, this time more slowly. âœ¢ WithnJames, Jacob learned to get up early for the good food. They wouldneat breakfast together and whoever was the first to the kitchen wouldndo the cooking. While they ate, and while he cleaned the mansion, annidea began to form in Jacob's mind. Even though he wasn't allowednaccess to certain parts of the place, he was learning his way around,nlistening in on conversations earned him a lot of information aboutnwhat went on behind closed doors. He knew he had to find away intonthe room where they kept taking Angela when she wasn't in her cagenor chained up outside like a dog. As henspent long hours dusting the railing near the top floor he heard thencries and the moans of pain behind the closed double doors. They werenhurting her everyday. And everyday the other janitor would be callednin to clean something up. It broke Jacob's heart to hear thosensounds and to know they were coming from Angela, but at least theyngave him a plan to get back there. âœ¢ \"Whyndon't you hit me...like they do?\" Jacobnhad been sitting beside Angela while she inhaled his dinner. Hernvoice startled him. He looked up and she was watching him, holdingnhalf a roll in her hand. \"Theynhit you?\" Shenput the roll back on the plate and lifted her dirty white shirt tonreveal black and blue marks all over her upper body. Jacobnwas speechless as he reached over to hug her, offer her some form ofncomfort, but she pulled away from him and curled herself up into thencorner, hugging her knees. \"I'mnnot going to hurt you,\" he said. \"Angel, I would never hurt you.nI love you.\" Shensaid nothing more. Only stayed in the corner. Jacobnlooked at his watch and realized he'd already been there too long. \"I'vengot to go. But I promise, Angel, I'm going to get you out of here.\" Shensaid nothing so he left, taking the plate and leaving her the othernhalf of the bread, which she didn't touch until the paneling wasnalmost to the floor.[Chapter 3] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 3 Thennext morning Jacob made sure he was up before both the cook and thensecond janitor. He began making eggs and toast and poured two glassesnof orange juice before scouring the cabinets until he found what henwas looking for: several different pain medications. Taking a pillnfrom each bottle he dumped them into one of the glasses of juice,nbefore setting the glasses on the table next to the food. He didn'tnhave long to wait when the other janitor came in and sat down tonbreakfast. He gobbled down the food on his plate and gulped down hisnorange juice before leaving with Jacob to start the day's cleaning.nNot even half an hour later Trelawney came downstairs, very irrate,nto find Jacob cleaning a bathroom. \"Wenneed you upstairs. Now,\" he said. \"Leave this bathroom. There'sna more important blood bath on the top floor. Get moving!\" Trelawneynfollowed Jacob up every flight of stairs as he wondered who's bloodnhad been spilled and where. Reaching the top floor he noticed thatnAngela's cage was open and she was gone. Jacob's musclesntightened and his heart began to pound. If they hurt her...if theyndid anything to her... \"Ourndoctor is busy with the other janitor pumping his stomach so you'llnhave to play doctor too,\" Trelawney said, taking the lead to thendouble doors he'd been forbidden to enter. \"Turns out he's verynsick. Lucky him.\" Uponnentering the rooms the first thing Jacob noticed was Angela on thenfloor in the center of the room sitting in a puddle of blood. Hernknees were drawn up to her chest but she wasn't hugging them. Shenwas hugging her right arm which was bleeding profusely. Her face onlynshowed the amount of pain and fear she was in. Jacobnran in and fell on the floor at her side. She slowly looked up as ifnshe was expecting the doctor. But when she saw who it was, hernfeatures softened and she almost smiled. Jacob didn't dare talk tonher at all as he gently reached over and took her right arm in hisnhands and looked closely at the blood. \"Inneed medical supplies!\" Jacob barked at all the Praetoriansnstanding above them, watching him work. \"Now! And paper towels!\" Someonenset a small kit beside him on the floor and a towel roll that wasnalmost gone. He was gentle in his work, cleaning her wound as best asnhe could with the paper towels. This way he was able to get a clearnview of what had happened to her to know how he should treat thenwound. While her hand was in his, it felt like the Praetoriansnweren't there, standing around them. He lifted his eyes to see hernwatching his face, her eyes big and round, as if she was surprised atnhis gentleness. Thenwound wasn't as bad as he'd feared. Though it did look a lot likena shallow knife wound. But once the blood was gone he had hernbandaged up in no time. \"Howndid this happen?\" he finally asked. \"Yournjob right now is to clean and patch, to make sure she stays alive fornus. Not to ask questions,\" Trelawney answered. \"Shenbetter not die because of your stupid actions, Trelawney,\" Mr.nWhite said, from his chair some distance away. \"We still need hernto tell us where and who Sorcerer is. No matter how long it takes.\" Sonshe'd been the one searching for him after all, searching undernPraetorian rule. And that was why she remembered Sorcerer. But itndidn't explain how she forgot about Jacob. Displeased by Sean'snobvious actions, but unwilling to risk everything right then andnthere, Jacob kept his mouth shut, while he finished bandaging hernarm. He was also glad to hear that last little tidbit about himself,nto know that he was who they were really after and not Angela. And tonthink that Sorcerer was in their midst already and they had no clue!nJacob would have laughed out loud if they hadn't been there. Thinkingnback to Angela, he knew he'd begun to win her trust the momentnshe'd let him take her arm. Although what choice did she have withnthe Praetorians there anyway. They'd said they wanted her alive, nonmatter what. They wouldn't let her bleed to death, even if it wouldnmean she wouldn't be in any more pain. Whennhe was done she was whisked away back to her cage and he was left tonclean up the pool of blood on the floor, as he furtively cased hisnsurroundings. Alongnone wall was a row of computers. In the opposite corner sat annelevated desk, rounded outward with a computer facing a large paddednswivel office chair. One look told Jacob that was the computer henwould need when it came time to break Angela out. âœ¢ Thatnnight as Jacob lay in bed unable to sleep he knew he couldn't letnAngela suffer any more. They had already beat her and cut her, henwouldn't, he couldn't, allow it to go on any longer. He had tonbreak her out. Duringnhis work as janitor he'd watched Sean and the others carefullynenter the code and press their hand against the palm reader to enterneach room. The computer in his mind told him just how he couldndisable one of them to disable them all. There would be no alarm onnany door so Jacob could walk freely throughout the mansion. And justnbefore he and Angela left, he would reset every alarm to a differentntune. Lock every Praetorian inside. The fire he had planned for thenkitchen stove would handle the rest. It would be a piece of cake ifnit all went well. ButnJacob knew he couldn't wait any longer. He knew they were hurtingnher, and it was hurting him. Letting it happen while he desperatelynplanned an elaborate escape and got to know more of the mansion wouldnonly give him more and more guilt than he already had. He thought henhad a fool-proof plan, but what if it backfired? He felt he needed anbackup plan. But that would take time. Time he didn't want tonwaste. Henknew now that when they broke into the original PraetoriannHeadquarters in New York City that they should have had a backupnplan. They should have had some way to communicate. Maybe then shenwouldn't have disappeared into the hands of the Praetorians fornthree years. Jacobngot up and put on his own clothes, slipping his CIC badge into hisnpocket, and left the room. His first stop was to the first alarmnsystem he came to on his way towards the kitchen. Pulling the covernoff he pulled a few wires and mixed them up, resetting them in newnplaces. The alarm went dead within seconds, allowing him to open thendoor without a problem. The next alarm he came to was already dead,nproving he'd successfully knocked them all out at once. Enteringnthe kitchen he knew he wouldn't have much time as he searched thencupboards looking for the vegetable oil. When he found it, he beganndumping it over the floor on his way to the gas stove in the farncorner. He dumped it all over the stove and turned each burner onnhigh before making a run for it. Now he would have to hurry. Hendashed up the stairs, past Angela's cage, and into the large roomnwhere he'd treated her wound earlier. There was a hand gun sittingnon the desk next to the computer. Checking to make sure it wasnloaded, he slid it into the back pocket of his jeans incase he needednit later. Pulling up the screen he was almost surprised to findnAngela's record up on the screen already. Someone had been staringnat her picture for a long time. This just made things that muchneasier for him. Jacob grinned as he threw in computer codes andngained access to her files. He changed her identity back to AngelanMarie Bennett, but then stopped. Henknew they'd done horrible things to her. She wasn't the samenperson anymore, and he doubted she ever would be again. She wouldnneed someone to look after her. He couldn't leave her alone, andnwhat if Walter, his boss, found her. He wouldn't believe Jacobnabout the Praetorians changing her identity. He'd see her only asnElizabeth Marx, no one else. Henwent back to her name and gave her a new last name to protect her atnall costs. Sliding the cursor down to \"relatives\" he typed: \"Lastnsurviving relatives: one brother, Jacob Gabriel Resh.\" He knew henloved her more than a brother should, but he was willing to donwhatever it took to ensure her safety. Savingnher file, he deleted it from the screen, only to find his own picturenstaring back at him underneath hers. Below was his real name and hisnrank as an FBI agent. They'd found him out. But it didn't matternanymore. As of tonight they would all be dead. They couldn't killnhim. Not when Angela was still alive and still needed his help.nOpening his file he quickly added in Angela Marie Bennett Resh as hisnone surviving sister and saved it. Timenwas running out and he knew it. He could feel the heat from the firenalready, though he wasn't sure if that was just his nerves kickingnin or if it was real. Either way, he needed to hurry. Sliding opennSean Trelawney's desk drawer he found what he was looking fornburied in the back. A key. A small key, he knew went to the collarnAngela wore around her neck. Runningnout of the room towards her cage to finally set her free, he wasnstopped in his tracks by the couple coming up the stairs. His eyesnwent wide and his hands began to shake. It was Sean with his hand onnAngela's shoulder. She had fresh bruises on her face and she wasnwalking slowly, as if the monster had hurt her in other places asnwell. Jacob knew, without having to ask, what had happened. Sean wasnin his pajamas. She was hurt. There was no need for interrogations.[Chapter 4] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 4 \"Ah,nAgent Resh. I assume you've figured everything out, have you? Thinknyou can get away with her? Save your bonnie lass? Eh?\" Jacobnwas thankful that the Praetorians slept further away from thenkitchens. Sean had no clue the mansion was burning down as he spoke.nAnd he wouldn't know until it was too late. \"Sonyou know who I am,\" Jacob said. \"What's it to you? If you killnme, someone will come looking for me, you know.\" \"I'vengot FBI clearance. I can easily get rid of you without anyonensuspecting a thing.\" Jacobnnoticed that Angela wasn't even crying. She hardly seemed affectednby what had obviously occurred between she and Sean. That only servednto let Jacob know this wasn't the first time, and he shuddered atnthe thought of what the man had been doing while he had her for threenwhole years. \"Well,nperhaps it would please you to know that I was sent here to arrestnLiz Marx in the first place,\" Jacob tried. \"Yes,nthat you were, I'm sure. But that's not the real reason you came.nYou have personal involvement in her case. You wouldn't turn herninto the FBI. That's why we were brought in, to capture her andnmake sure she didn't escape again.\" \"Thatndoesn't work for me, Sean Trelawney. I know all about thenPraetorian Guard. You're not real FBI. You were never RCMP, or anyncop for that matter.\" \"Hmmm,nyes, I thought you might. Being Sorcerer and all. Of course, you werenthe one we were after all along. And we knew you'd do anything tonget her back. We knew you'd show up for her. And now we've gotnyou.\" \"That'snonly what you want to think. You don't have me, Trelawney. You onlynwish you did.\" Regainingncomposure, Jacob reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pullednout the hand gun he'd grabbed from Sean's desk and grinned. Thenpoor man in his pajamas wasn't carrying a weapon on him. Jacobnwatched the man's eyes widen as he inched to the wall, his handnstill on Angela's shoulder, and reach for the closest alarm system.nWithout looking at it, he punched a code into the keypad, probablynalerting everyone of his imminent danger. When nothing happened henglanced at the system and did a double take. \"Yes,nSean, I am smarter than you think. The alarm systems are all dead.nNot only that, but I think you'll find, if you go down to thenkitchen a fire is well under way. You're all going to die here,nwhether you want to or not, while Angela and I make our escape.\" Trelawney'sneyes went wider with fear. \"Letnher go.\" ThenPraetorian's grasp loosened on her shoulder. Jacob motioned for hernto come to his side. She left Trelawney, and walked slowly to Jacob.nWhile Jacob was happy, nearly elated that she'd willingly switchednsides to join him, he knew she was only following orders. \"Getndown on your knees,\" Jacob instructed Trelawney. \"Hands behindnyour head.\" Seanndid as he was told, though with a slight chuckle. \"What, you'rengoing to arrest me? What good is that going to do? I've gotncontacts. I'll get out of it slicker than a whistle.\" \"Inwasn't planning on arresting you,\" Jacob put the muzzle of thengun to the back of his head. \"I was planning on sending you tonhell.\" Henpulled the trigger once and watched as his enemy fell to the floor inna heap. Thrusting the weapon back into his pocket, he turned to findnAngela curled up in a ball on the floor, tucked as far as she couldninto the corner. Already he could smell smoke and knew this time itnwasn't his mind playing tricks on him. \"Comenon, Angel, we need to get out of here,\" he spoke soothingly to her,nas he approached her. Shenpulled away from him, staring at him in fear. She didn't know himnanymore. And in his attempts to reacquaint her with who he was, he'dnleft out the fact that he'd had FBI training. He could handlenweapons, he could arrest people. He wasn't exactly the Jacob she'dnremember. \"Angel,nI promise, I'm not going to hurt you. I changed your identity back.nThe cops can't touch you now.\" Fallingnto his knees beside her, he felt hot tears sliding down his face. \"I'venspent all this time looking for you. I know the FBI wants to arrestnyou as Liz Marx. But they can't. You're not her, and I won'tnlet them. Angel, I...\" he knew he had to tell her the truth aboutnher new identity. He couldn't leave that out, like he'd left outnhis training earlier. \"I put you in as my sister. I can take carenof you that way. Make sure no one hurts you ever again. I love you.nPlease, Angel, just believe me. You've got to believe me!\" Smokenwas starting to billow up the staircase, and he knew the fire wasnspreading faster and faster as he spoke. \"Younhave to come with me. I'm not leaving here without you. Even if itnkills me.\" Angelanlooked from the smoke to Jacob and back again. \"Please!\"nhe begged. Shenlooked up into his worried eyes, and slowly reached her arms out tonhim. Relief flooded Jacob's veins as he picked her up into his armsnand held her close. Dashing down the smoke filled stairs he wishednhe'd also had firefighter training as well. The second floor wasnalready wreathed in flames. The main stairs were crumbling betweennthe second and the first floors. Changing direction Jacob ran for thenback staircase near his tiny closet of a bedroom. They were fillednwith smoke, but no flames yet. He charged down them and stopped innhis tracks. Therenwas no way he was going to get through without getting burned. Thenfloor was covered in flames. But he had to get through, he had to getnAngela out of there, and he had to find an alarm system to lockneveryone else in, to ensure their death. He pulled Angela closer tonhim and tried to cover her face as he ran through the fire to thenclosest door. Hencould feel the heat breaking his skin open, as he did his best tonprotect Angela. Reaching the door after what seemed like forever,nJacob pulled the cover off the alarm system, and rewired it beforenthe fire had a chance to reach that far. He slipped through the frontndoor just as the fresh oxygen reinvigorated the fire and it burstnafter him until the door shut and locked behind him. Reaching thenmain gate, he disarmed the gate's separate alarm system and escapednwith Angela, hearing the screams of the Praetorian Guard as they wokento the sound of the roaring fire, and the smoke filling theirnbedrooms. Standingna long distance away Jacob set Angela down and wrapped his armsnaround her as they watched the mansion burn together. Tears slippedndown his face and dripped onto her shoulder. They'd done horriblenthings to her. They'd killed the Angela he knew. But she was freenof them now. Free to start her life over again. And he would be withnher every step of the way. Oncenhe was sure there was no possible way a single Praetorian couldnescape the eternal fires of hell he'd thrown them into, he tooknAngela's shoulders in his hands and turned her around to face him.nHer eyes were big and sad. But also scared, as if she had no cluenwhat was in store for her next. The place that had been her home fornthree years, the place she'd never left, had just been destroyednand she was outside the gate standing with a man she hardly knew. \"I'vengot the key, to take that collar off,\" he whispered, as if shenwould bolt and run away if he spoke any louder. Shenstood there, without saying a word, letting him take charge of her,nof her life, of her body, because that was what she was used to fornthe last three years. She'd forgotten everything else. This wasnwhat she knew. If Jacob took down the Praetorians, it stood to reasonnhe would be her keeper from now on, holding her as a slave in his ownnhouse. Henreached into his pocket and brought out the key. \"I'mnjust going to take it off. Can you just stand still for me? I promisenthis won't hurt.\" Henwas a little apprehensive about taking it off. Her throat was so rawnand he could clearly see bits of dried blood here and there. Having andoctor present might be a good idea, but Angela wouldn't trustnanyone else. It would take too long. Slowly he reached out and tooknhold of the harsh metal collar. Angela flinched but didn't make ansound. \"Itnwill be ok. I'm going to do this as quick as possible. Ready?\" Shennodded, as if she had no other choice. Before he could change hisnmind, Jacob thrust the key into the lock in the collar on the side ofnher neck, and turned. Pulling the collar open he made sure the hingenon the other side didn't pinch her. When it came loose its weightnpulled it to the ground. Underneathnwas a terrifying site. Much of her skin had been rubbed completelynraw by the collar and what little that had been left had gotten stucknto the metal and ripped away when it fell. Fresh blood came to thensurface of her skin, and began running down her neck to soak into thenone piece of clothing she owned. Withoutnthinking Jacob took off his own shirt to stop the bleeding. But uponnseeing him shed his clothing Angela took a brief step backward, eyesnwide with fear, staring at him. And Jacob knew why. Hotnstinging tears came to his eyes, as he tried to sooth her, \"It'snok, Angel. I'm not going to hurt you. I promise. I promise I won'tnhurt you. I won't let anyone hurt you ever again. It's just thatnyou're bleeding. I want to stop the bleeding,\" he tried, doingnhis best to hold back the tears. \"Can I? Can I stop the bleeding?\" Henoffered his shirt to her and without a sound she took a step towardsnhim, allowing him to carefully wrap the soft cloth around her woundednneck. \"Angel,nI've got a car not too far away from here. If it's still there, Inwant to head into Chicago since we're close. I can get us a hotelnroom there, and patch up your neck, get you some new clothes. Ok?\" Angelannodded submissively. He wanted nothing than to shake her and tell hernthat if she didn't want that she could say so. But he couldn't.nHe needed to take care of her. It would be a long, slow process tonget her back to her old self, or as close to her old self as he couldnget her. No matter how much he told her right now that she was hernown person, that she could make her own choices in life, she wouldnstill do whatever he told her. Besides that, he was all she had. Itnwasn't like she could go somewhere called 'home' or go tonanother hotel on her own. She had no money. She had nothing. ExceptnJacob. \"Cannyou walk?\" he asked. Shennodded again and they started off. Jacobndidn't know what else to tell her, there was so much, so he keptnquiet instead and led her back into town to the small side streetnwhere his car was miraculously still parked. Well, it was a standardngovernment issue car, no one would mess with it, for fear of thengovernment coming after them. Thentown was still sound asleep this late at night. With the mansion sonfar up the hill no one heard or saw a thing. Everyone slept on. Andnfor that, Jacob was great full. Approachingnhis car Angela stopped short and stared at it. It could have beennsimilar to what the Praetorians had kidnaped her in that fateful daynthey tried to get her identity back. And that could have been thenlast time she saw a car. Anything was possible. Jacobnfound himself consoling her again, letting her know that everythingnwas ok. He helped her into the car and buckled her seatbelt for hernbefore closing her door and walking back to the trunk where he openedna small suitcase on wheels and brought out a clean t-shirt to slideninto. Angelanwas silent the whole way into Chicago, as silent as she had alwaysnbeen. Jacob was hoping within a few days he could take her in to seenthe doctor he'd played online chess with a few years ago, back whennhe had still been Sorcerer. He'd treated a bullet wound she'd hadnonce and because she knew the great Sorcerer he hadn't gone to thencops. He would be the one, the only one, to trust with Angela'snhealth. But first Jacob had to get her out of her shell a little bit.nIf she didn't remember Jacob, chances are she wouldn't remembernSteven Graff either. Thosenhot, stinging tears he'd held back earlier returned in a rush andnran down his face to soak his shirt. He wanted nothing right thennother than to stop the car and gather her in his arms and sob untilnhe was as dry as the desert. But he knew he couldn't. She would shynaway from him and he had to be strong for her, to help her get strongnagain. Severalnhours later they arrived at a large hotel and he was able to get themna room in the back, where they could come and go through a backnentrance. \"Arenyou ready?\" he asked when he'd parked the car right next to thenrear door. Therenwas no response from her for several seconds and then, in a barelynaudible whisper, \"yes.\" Thenwhole ride from the small town to the big city she'd starednstraight ahead, never moving her head to look out the side window ornto rest it in a hand. Nothing. And now he understood why. Not onlynwas it probably ingrained in her from her years at the Praetoriannmansion, but her neck was probably stiff, and very painful. He'dnchecked it once when he'd stopped at a drug store to get somenmedical supplies. It had stopped bleeding, though his shirt wasnsoaked red. Oncenupstairs, he was unsure how to proceed. Lord knew she needed anshower, and badly. But she also needed to have her wounds looked at.nWhich should be done first? And then there was the problem ofnclothes. All she had was what she had on, and that would be thrownnout as soon as she took it off to shower. \"Thenbest I have to offer you right now is what I packed for myself,\" hensaid as she sat down on one of the beds he'd motioned to. \"Inpromise they're clean.\" \"Ok,\"nshe whispered. \"You'dnbest take a shower first. Just be careful of your neck. Before younchange I'll bandage your neck for you.\" Angelangot up and headed for the bathroom. She was taking what he said asnorders. All he wanted now was some form of rejection from her. Fornher to not want to shower. For her to turn around and say 'no'.nBut she didn't. He wanted to offer to help, knowing what hernbathroom at the mansion was like, with no shower, not even a bathtub.nBut he also knew that was a bad idea. He had to build her trust backnup again, slowly. Even if it killed him.[Chapter 5] The Net: Dog: Chapter 5 An hour later she was finally washed, dried, bandaged, and curled up in a ball under the covers of a hotel bed wearing Jacob's own pajamas. She looked unsure of things. And he remembered the dirty blankets she'd been sleeping on for three years. The bed was almost foreign to her. She seemed uncomfortable because she wasn't used to it, not because it wasn't comfortable. Or perhaps because of time spent with Sean and who knows how many of the others. Jacob cringed at that thought as he climbed into the other bed in a t-shirt and boxers. He pulled the covers up over him before reaching for the light switch above the night stand between the two beds. He stopped when he saw her. \"Angel, everything's going to be ok now. You're safe. You have your life back. Tomorrow we can get you some clothes that will fit you. I know this will take time. You've been kept...\" Jacob tried to say it. Tried to say where and how she was kept. But he couldn't. \"You've missed the outside world for so long. But you'll get back to it. You'll remember how things go.\" Her brows furrowed in confusion while he spoke. \"I know you don't understand everything. But you will. It will all make sense eventually.\" He reached for the light switch again. \"And Angel, don't ever forget that I love you. Ok?\" \"I won't,\" she whispered. Jacob turned out the light, but he didn't close his eyes. He was tired, after everything that had happened but there was no way he could fall asleep now. He lay in the darkness wondering if Angela was sleeping or what was going through her mind if she wasn't. He was thankful the town had been close to Chicago. The doctor that had healed Angela's gunshot wound years ago would be able to help again. As soon as Angela was ready for the world, he would take her to see Dr. Steven Graff, the man he'd played online chess with as Sorcerer. Just how he would deal with his boss, Walter Cizelski, he had no idea. He had a feeling he would have to quit his job, find something else to keep him and Angela afloat. But he was also afraid to leave her anywhere alone for a long time after what she'd been through. But taking her on the job wouldn't be a good idea either. Who would hire a young guy who had a tag-a-long girl who never said a word and always looked forlorn. Not that these things wouldn't change with time. But then a thought occurred to him. Angela had once held a job where she was able to work at home, fixing computers. Why couldn't he do the same thing? He smiled sadly in the night, wishing he hadn't had to make decisions like that. Sure he could do it. Sure he might even enjoy such a job. But the reason for it was what made him wince. And Sean Trelawney along with all the other Praetorians were already dead so he couldn't exact any more revenge on them. He had to turn his energies to Angela, to help her get better as best he could. She would need all of his love and support. Without warning there was a thud and Angela's voice cried out in the darkness. Jacob snapped the light back on and found Angela on the other side of her bed on the floor, pulling at the blankets, trying to drag them off the bed towards the corner of the room. When she saw Jacob jump out of bed she let go of them and scrambled into the corner. Tears ran down her face and he saw her blink several times, trying to swallow the lump in her throat and to stop crying. Her luck was fading fast as more tears followed the first and she began to sob. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" she apologized over and over again. Jacob went quickly to her side and knelt close to her, wanting to take her in his arms and hold her until she was as dry as the Nevada desert. But he wasn't sure she would accept him. Would she think he was going to do something Sean had done to her? But he couldn't let her stay like that, crying in the corner, alone. He had to do something. He had to hold her. Reaching out to her he gently placed a hand on one of her knees that she'd brought up to her chest. She was holding her hands in front of her face, as if she could hide from him that way. As if he would get angry at her for crying. She looked up at his touch with fear in her eyes. He didn't move his hand. Nor did he say anything. Until then all he'd done was tell her how much he loved her and would never hurt her. But he'd never shown her. Really shown her. There was more ways then one to win her trust. She continued to watch him, the fear lessening in her eyes as the minutes crawled by. The tears continued to spill from her eyes though she'd stopped sobbing. And then she lowered her hand from her face and placed it on his. He wanted to take her hand in his, but he remained still, letting her take the lead. A long time went by and she looked from his face to where their hands were together, one on top of the other. She moved hers, felt the softness of his hands and then took it in hers in a hard grip as more tears came pouring from her eyes and she began to sob again. She pulled his hand towards her, and he took the cue moving to sit beside her and finally pull her into his arms and let her cry herself out. Awhile later she'd cried herself to sleep in Jacob's arms, gripping his hand in hers. He still had no clue what had set her off, but she was over it. And she'd let him come to her. It was no longer the fact that Jacob was in charge. She'd let him come. She'd let him hold her while she cried. And now she was sound asleep in his arms, her head resting on his shoulder. With his free hand he grabbed the end of the blanket she'd been trying to pull off the bed and yanked it toward them, carefully wrapping it around her to keep her warm. Slowly he closed his own eyes and fell into the first deep, restful sleep he'd gotten since losing her so many years ago. âœ¢ There was a loud bang and Jacob was jerked awake with Angela. Lifting his head and straining to see through his sleep-filled eyes with a stiff neck and body from sleeping on the floor Jacob saw several men running into their hotel room. \"FBI! Stand up! Hands in the air!\" Walter's voice rang through the room loud and clear. Angela was sitting up beside Jacob, her eyes wide, unsure what to do. Jacob took her hand in his and held it tight, to ensure her that everything would be ok. She pulled out of his grasp and scrambled further into the corner, curling up into a ball. \"Walter? What are you doing here?\" Jacob stood up, clearing his eyes with the back of his hands. \"Saving your ass. What's going on? I send you on a case and you don't report back? You've been gone for over a month without contacting me! Jane Faraday said she saw you here with Liz Marx. Tell me what's going on. You're supposed to be arresting her and bringing her in.\" \"Walter...look...it's not that simple.\" \"Right. Sure. Arrest her,\" he ordered the other agents beside him, obviously on loan from the regular FBI that didn't handle internet crimes. \"What?! You can't arrest her!\" \"Why not? She's Elizabeth Marx. You knew this had to happen. Why are you protecting her?\" The two men moved towards Angela who tried her hardest to sink into the walls behind her. \"She's my sister,\" Jacob said, trying to be brave. \"She's my sister,\" he said again, trying to convince himself as much as Walter. \"You don't have a sister, Jacob.\" \"I do. Her name is Angela. Angela Marie Bennett Resh.\" \"Long name. Why isn't she talking?\" Walter called the men off her and she relaxed slightly. \"She's been through a lot recently...\" Walter cut him off, \"She's got a lot of bruises. How did those happen?\" \"She was kidnaped. They hurt her.\" \"How come I never heard about any of this? And why does she look like Elizabeth Marx?\" \"It's a long story, and I don't know,\" Jacob said, answering both questions. Walter smirked and came further into the room, holstering his gun and resting his hands on his hips. \"Resh, you realize this looks bad for you. I don't care if she is your sister. I am your boss. You do work for the FBI. This could break your career.\" \"I don't care about that. I just want to keep her safe.\" \"Awww, that's so touching and sweet.\" The other two agents smirked with him. \"Throw some clothes on Resh,\" Walter said, throwing him a pair of pants that were on the floor near the FBI's feet. Jacob did as he was told and turned to see Angela cowering in the corner, her eyes filled with fear as she looked from Walter to Jacob. Walter approached Angela who tried to disappear into the walls again. She looked up at him before turning her eyes to the ground and hugging her knees as close to her body as she could. Jacob's boss turned and walked out of the room, telling the two agents to stay there and keep an eye on Jacob and Liz. Jacob glared at Walter's retreating back and walked back over to Angela intent on sitting beside her to comfort her. One of the agents got in his way. \"No. You stay apart from her. Far apart. Sit there,\" the agent said pointing towards the bed Jacob had been in the night before for a short period of time. Jacob did as he was told until Walter came back into the room. \"Got a psychologist on her way to look at her.\" \"What?!\" Jacob bounded from his seat to confront his boss. \"Sit your ass back down Resh. I need to be clear of this situation before I make a decision one way or the other. You claim she's your sister Angela Resh. But when I hired you your only relative was your grandmother and she died two years ago. She also happens to look a lot like Liz Marx. Come on, Resh, you went to Quantico, you've been working for me for three years now, you should understand where I'm coming from. When Jane contacted me the only thing we could think of was that Liz Marx had kidnaped you and had you under her control.\" Jacob slowly nodded as he sat down again. Of course he did understand. It did make sense, from Walter's point of view. He just didn't want to let go of Angela so soon after finding her and getting her to safety. He just didn't want anything to happen to her. Didn't want her to be scared. She didn't know Walter. \"You,\" Walter spoke to the agents. \"Take her into custody. The psychologist will meet you at the county courthouse in half an hour. Do not let her out of your sight. In fact, it would be best if you handcuffed her to one of you to make sure she can't escape. And Resh, don't say one word. Not one single word. Or I'll have you arrested for assault and battery. Maybe even rape, the way she's acting.\" Jacob could only stare at his boss, eyes wide, for a few seconds before his mouth caught up with his brain. \"But you know me, Walter! You know I would never...\" \"No. I thought I knew you. But now...\" \"It's a long story, I know.\" \"Look, I told you, one word. And you've already said too many. Shut up. Now.\" Jacob did as he was told, watching the agents pull Angela roughly from the floor and threw one half of the cuffs around her wrist and the other around one of the agent's wrists. She looked back at Jacob as they led her to the door. The look in her eyes clearly said she didn't want to leave. \"Go with them,\" Jacob told her, ignoring Walter's command. \"Everything will be ok,\" he said, doing his best to calm her fears with his voice, praying that he would be able to see her again. Soon. Angela dutifully followed the agents but never took her eyes off Jacob until he couldn't see her any more. A/N: If you're liking this story so far, please post a review and let me know! If there's something that's bothering you about it, let me know that too! I know this story sounds rushed, and I appologize for that, I really was rushing to finish it. But if there's anything else you find wrong or whatever, I'd still like to know. It would mean a lot to me to get at least one review from someone, whether you liked it or not. Please, and thanks![Chapter 6] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 6 Walterngrabbed the wooden desk chair and spun it around so that he could sitnbackward on it and face Jacob. \"So,nit's a long story. This much I know. And it's time you tell menhow it goes. We've got all the time in the universe.\" Jacobngulped. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" \"Trynme. Maybe I won't believe you, but I want to hear your side of thenstory before I hear hers. Or did you two collaborate your stories sonthat neither one of you can be caught lying.\" Jacobncouldn't believe his ears. True Walter wasn't the best boss innthe world, but he'd never been this bad before. Walter had beennlooking for agents to populate his new FBI program known as the CICnor Center for Intrusion Control. He needed people who were excellentnat computer work because he wasn't, but he knew the internet needednpolicing. When Jacob had been arrested at the Praetorian Headquartersnin New York City the FBI recognized in him exactly what Walter wasnlooking for. So, when he was found innocent in what had gone down,nthey sent him to Quantico for training and gave him to Walter. Truthnbe told, no one liked Walter much. Or his idea of policing theninternet. No one thought the CIC would last long, so they'd pickednJacob, just a kid at the time, mostly to get back at Walter and tonensure the CIC's failure. Things had gone the opposite since then,nhowever. Together Jacob and Walter had arrested many criminals andnthe CIC was becoming bigger and bigger as time went on. Just a yearnafter they'd formed the CIC another agent had come on to the team,nand then another a year after that. Both guys stayed in Seattle,nkeeping their home base running whenever he or Walter went out onncases. Now he was beginning to see why people despised him so much. \"Younknow about my history, before we met, how I was arrested, right?\"nJacob asked, figuring he'd do best to start at the very beginning. \"Sure,nI read the report. You broke into a travel agency, but didn't stealnanything. What's that got to do with this?\" \"Everything.\"nJacob sighed and started with the day he'd sent Angela the messagenshe wasn't supposed to see. The message he'd finally managed tonsend the sister he'd never met before. The sister he hadn't evennknown he had until he'd begun digging up information about hisnfather. Their father. He'dnjust gotten to the end of his story when Walter's cell phone rang. \"Walter,\"nhe answered. \"Yes. He's right here. We're at the hotel...No.nWhat did she say?...Great. Just great...You want tontalk...yeah...yeah sure...Room 1110.\" Walternhung up his phone and reattached it to his belt. \"Jane'sncoming over to talk to you.\" \"How'snAngela,\" Jacob asked, trying to ignore the pain in his heart. \"Theynadmitted her to the hospital. She's too thin, undernourished, hernthroat looks like someone took a swipe at it with something sharp,nshe's been beaten near to death, possibly raped, and she's weak.nShe also won't say anything to anyone, terrified out of her mind.nProbably afraid if she talks her attacker will come after her I bet.nThat's usually how it is.\" \"Butnthey're dead. I just told you. They're dead. They won't comenafter her again. I was trying to tell her...\" Therenwas a loud knock on the door and Walter got up to answer it. JanenFaraday walked in with a purpose to her heeled steps. Her lips werenpursed and she looked angry, also perhaps just a little bit happy,nsince she didn't like either Jacob or Walter. \"Walter,nwould you excuse us for a moment. We need to have a privatenconversation.\" Withoutna word, Jacob's boss left the room. Jane grabbed the chair he'dnbeen sitting in and spun it around before sitting down, her legsncrossed. She pulled out a small tape recorder from her suit jacketnpocket and hit the record button. \"So,nJacob, you were sent out to find and arrest Elizabeth Marx. Is thatncorrect?\" she asked. \"Yes,nI was.\" \"Andnlet me get this straight, you thought that because she was a criminalnsomeone wanted by the FBI for a bunch of computer crimes you couldnhave your way with her? You thought you could beat her and rape hernonce you had her under custody?\" Jacob'sneyes widened with horror and his heart pounded at the accusations.n\"No! No, that's not it at all! You didn't talk to Walter. Injust explained it all to him.\" \"Yeah,nwell he's not one of my most favorite people in the world and Inhardly trust him. Especially when you work for him. So explain it allnto me. How does a criminal you're supposed to bring in wind upnbeaten and starved to death while you're cavorting around withoutnchecking in with Walter as to your whereabouts?\" \"She'snmy sister,\" Jacob explained once again. A single tear slid down hisnface. \"She's my sister. I haven't seen her in a long time, andnI was on the Marx case when I suddenly found her, and she was in suchna state, I had to take my time to get her out of her situation...\" \"Cutnthe crap and the tears. You're an FBI agent for gods sake.\" Jacobnwiped his tears on the back of his sleeve and started at thenbeginning as he had just done for Walter, telling the story of thenPraetorians chasing Angela. \"LikenI buy that load of crap. You hurt her. And even though she wasnsupposed to be sent to prison, she'll be going to a nut house,nthanks to you. And you, you'll be the one going to prison.\" Janenstood up with a huff and went to the door. Walter had been standingnon the other side of it, half listening in, judging by the way he wasnleaning towards the crack. \"Walter,nget your ass in here. Your agent screwed up, and now I have to dealnwith it. If this in anyway comes back to you, you can be sure I'llnbe happy to slap those handcuffs of yours on your wrists right afternI slap them on his.\" \"Hey,nI had nothing to do with this!\" Walter tried to defend himself. \"Right.nSure you didn't. Or is it that CIC is failing after all, and you'renjust trying to defend your best agent so it doesn't all go down thentoilet. Well, let me tell you something, Walter, you'd best tellnthat little agent of yours never to do this again, because I hatendefending criminals who are too scared shitless to talk!\" Andnwith that last angry outrage, Jane Faraday stalked out of the roomnslamming the door behind her. Walter didn't even look at Jacob asnhe passed by him, grabbing the chair he'd been sitting innpreviously and moving it so he could sit in front of the tv. Henswitched it on to a news channel and slouched in the wooden chair,nstaring at the screen. Jacobnonly sighed and looked away from his boss, to the corner where he'dnspent the night with Angela. \"She'snmy sister,\" he whispered to himself. \"I would never hurt mynsister.\" Anotherntear made its way down his face. He'd gotten so close to her lastnnight, she'd allowed him to hold her while she slept. And now she'dnbeen taken away from him. Chances were that he would have to worknhard to regain that small amount of trust all over again if he everngot her back. If he was ever allowed to see her again. He didn'tnknow what she was going through just then, but it couldn't be good.nHis boss's boss said she was scared shitless. All he wanted to donwas find her and hold her, let her know everything would be ok, thatnhe'd always be there for her, no matter what, that he wouldn'tnlet anyone hurt her ever again. But he couldn't. There seemed to benno way to prove that it wasn't him that hurt her. No way at all. Walter'snphone rang and he put the tv on mute before answering it. A fewnminutes later he hung up and turned to Jacob. \"Thendoctors at the hospital had to drug her just to be able to knock hernout to treat her wounds. The psychologist hasn't even had a chancento talk to her yet her condition is so bad. Just thought you'd wantnto know.\" AndnWalter turned back to the news. Jacobnturned onto his side to face the wall away from his boss. He feltnlike a scared five year old, as he tucked his knees up underneath hisnchin and hugged himself, wishing he was hugging Angela instead. Henwanted to be with her now more than ever. \"Everything'sngoing to be ok,\" he whispered to her, as if she was there in frontnof him. As if he wasn't the scared one. \"I promise, I'll comensee you soon. They'll take good care of you, I'm sure.\" âœ¢ Thenday slowly passed on and turned into night. Several agents had comenat Jane's request to keep an eye on Walter and Jacob, standingnguard outside their hotel room door. At least they allowed Walter tonorder Chinese take-out for dinner. Jacob grabbed his own dinner andntogether they ate in silence. Notnknowing what else to do, Jacob curled up under the covers of the bednhe'd been sitting on and closed his eyes, saying a silent prayernfor Angela before managing to fall asleep. âœ¢ Nonword came about Angela for several days and Jacob was gettingnworried. The only other person he and Walter had seen was someonenfrom the local Crime Lab, asking for a sample of Jacob's DNA. He'dnonly been there five minutes, taking a quick swab of his mouth beforenhe was gone. AsnJacob paced the length of the small room, anxious to escape the darknprison they were held in, with no sunlight allowed in because of thendark curtains, his mind came up with all sorts of reasons why theynhadn't heard anything. The most frequent excuse was that she wasnsilent and they were waiting for her to admit every wrong Jacob hadnever done to her. But he knew she wouldn't because it wasn'tntrue. He'd never hurt her. He'd always been kind and gentle, evennwhen he'd picked up her frail body the night of the fire andnwhisked her away from the burning mansion. She wouldn't saynanything against him. Unless they forced her. She'd been used tontaking orders from the Praetorians. This might turn out to be nondifferent. Anothernthought was that something had happened while they were treating hernwounds and complications had risen. This only scared him more. Whatnif they'd accidentally hurt her? What if something had gonenterribly wrong? Jacobnsilently begged for some news of Angela. Any news at all had to benbetter than pacing the small room with no news. Had the psychologistngotten a chance to talk to her? What was the prognosis? Would Angelanget better as Jacob wished every single day? Or was she fated to staynthe way she was for the rest of her life? Maybe this was why theynrefused to call. Or maybe they were steadily building a case againstnhim. He sighed. Anything was possible. Anything at all. Withneach passing night he slept less and less, becoming more worried fornher. Walter seemed to be just fine other than pissed because he wasnstuck in a tiny room with Jacob. He slept fine. But Jacob tossed andnturned, remembering that night he'd seen Sean Trelawney coming upnthe stairs with his hand on Angela's shoulder. The night he knewnjust how bad everything was for her beyond the beatings. Tearsnpricked at his eyes as they seemed to do every night since she'dnbeen taken away from him. There was nothing he could do for her. Theynwere both in the hands of the law now. And even though he was part ofnthat law, that didn't matter. He was suspected of being a dirtyncop, a dirty FBI agent. Things could only go downhill from here. Fornhim at least. He prayed that they would take good care of Angela, getnher over her issues, help her become the woman she was before shendisappeared so long ago. There was a chance she would be ok. âœ¢ Fivendays after Angela was taken Jane Faraday barged into the hotel room. \"Shencan't even eat with a knife and fork! What the hell did you do tonher?!\" the woman screamed at Jacob the moment she set eyes on him. \"Intold you what happened!\" \"Yeah,nwell the psychologist wants to talk to you. So hurry up and get innthe car.\" Jacobngot off the bed, hoping against all hope that he might be able to seenAngela. But he made sure he didn't look happy on the outside as hencalmly walked over to Jane and held out his hands to her. \"Youngonna cuff me when you take me downtown or what?\" he asked. \"Justnget your ass out here. Walter, you stay put. I want to talk to younlater.\" Thenride to the local police station was quiet and uncomfortable. Jacobnwanted to ask her how Angela was, if she was getting any better, butnhe decided against it. It wouldn't help his case and it would onlynanger her more. Whennthey arrived she led him down several cramped and crowded hallwaysnpainted an ugly green that had gotten dirty over the years. There wasnalmost no room to move in the place but when people saw an angry JanenFaraday FBI agent coming, they quickly stepped out of the way. Shenopened a door to their left and shoved Jacob inside, slamming thendoor shut behind him. He found himself in an interrogation room withna man in a white lab coat. \"Younmust be Jacob Resh, have a seat,\" the man motioned to the metalnfolding chair opposite the table he sat at. \"I'm Dr. Vecchio.\" \"You'renthe psychologist who looked at Angela, right?\" \"Yes,nthat's correct.\" \"Hownis she?\" \"I'mnsorry but I can't discuss that with you. We're here to talk aboutnyou.\" \"Injust need to know that she's ok. Please. It's been too long...\" Thendoctor cut him off. \"Why don't you tell me what happened.\" \"ButnI've already told both my boss and his boss.\" \"Comennow, Agent Resh. You are an FBI agent, surely you know how many timesna suspect must repeat a story?\" \"What,nso now I'm a suspect?\" \"Younabove all else should know the adage that no one is ruled out at thenstart of an investigation, especially those closest to the victim.nNow, would you please recount your story, one more time?\" Jacobnsighed before giving in and retelling it again, doing his best tonremember exactly what he'd told Walter and Jane Faraday aboutnAngela being his sister. \"Thatnexplains a lot,\" Dr. Vecchio said in deep thought as he studiednJacob. \"Likenwhat?\" \"Intold you already, I can't speak to you about her.\" \"Doc,nshe's what this is about. It's all about her. What does itnexplain?\" \"Thenbruises. The fact that she's nearly skin and bone. The fact thatnshe doesn't use utensils when she eats. The evidence of rape.\" Thisnwas the last place Jacob wanted to be. He didn't think he couldndeal with talking about Angela like that much longer. He wanted tonforget that it had ever happened. How many times had they hurt her,nhe didn't want to know. Once was one too many. \"Butnit doesn't prove that you weren't the one who beat her, who rapednher.\" \"You'rennot a cop and this isn't an investigation,\" Jacob said, a littlentoo hotly. \"I'mnsorry. You're right. I'll leave matters of the police to AgentnFaraday.\" \"Please,nDr. Vecchio, I just need to see her. Can I see her? I need to knownthat she's alright.\" \"No.nI'm afraid I cannot allow that. At least for a few more days. I'mnstill trying to verify her condition and I can't have youncontaminating anything. Nothing against you personally, younunderstand. This is the way I can prove your innocence, if you arenindeed innocent. And if you go in there and talk to her, Faraday willnonly assume you're telling her to keep her mouth shut about younhurting her or you'll kill her. And you know where that could go.\" Jacobnnodded. \"Yes, I know. But please, can you at least tell me if she'sngetting any better? Is she eating more? Is she healthier, physicallynat least?\" Thendoctor sighed and looked at Jacob a moment before responding, \"Thisnis all I can tell you. She's better than when I first saw her, butnnot by much.\" \"Thanknyou Doctor,\" Jacob said with a faint smile that only lasted ansecond. \"That's all I needed to hear.\"[Chapter 7] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 7 \"Rapenkit came back on Jane Doe,\" Jane Faraday said the next day back innthe dark hotel room with Walter. \"And you're lucky Resh. Althoughnresults indicated that she was raped repeatedly over a long period ofntime, you've been cleared of that charge.\"Jacob was aware thatnhe'd be cleared. It didn't take a dummy to figure that one out. \"Whyndid you call her Jane Doe? Her name is Angela.\" \"Whynyes, it actually is. Surprising, isn't it?\" she asked, lookingnover at Walter sitting on the opposite bed from Jacob. \"AngelanMarie Bennett Resh. Sole surviving sister to one Jacob Gabriel Resh,naccording to her record.\" Walternsaid nothing, just sat there, staring at both of them lookingnstunned. \"Inhad a Crime Scene Investigation team find the mansion you talkednabout Resh. They're going through their findings right now as wenspeak. Hopefully we'll know more in the next few days as they piecenthe evidence together along with what Dr. Vecchio has to say. So wencan't get you on any rape charges, but I'm sure something elsenwill stick. See you later boys.\" Withnthat, Jane left the still dark hotel room. Jacob leaned back againstnthe pillows on his bed with a sigh. He was glad he'd been cleared,nbut not entirely happy. Walter only leaned forward to look at Jacob. \"Younknow they shut down CIC.\" Jacobnlooked at him. \"They did what?\" \"Theynshut down CIC. Until this is all over. Thanks to you Dave and Benncan't keep the home fires burning. They can't work on cases. Theyncan't do shit! Because of your stupidness. I'm stuck here,ndepressed as hell, unable to do my job. Thanks, Resh. Thanks a lot.\" \"You'renwelcome,\" Jacob grumbled. \"You know this isn't what I wanted.\" \"Inknow. You were planning to spirit her away without telling anyone.nYou were going to quit the CIC.\" \"Howndid you know?\" \"Injust do. But what I don't know is why.\" \"Becausenshe's my sister!\" Jacob stared at his feet in dejection. \"Thenmen who did this to her are gone. Dead from the fire. So there'snnothing left for me to do except to keep her safe and to help her getnback her life.\" \"Keepnher safe from who?\" Walter asked, still leaning towards him fromnthe edge of his own bed that had once been Angela's. \"Fromneveryone. From people who would want to hurt her like that again. Andnfrom the law. From doctors who would want to throw her into a mentalninstitution. From people who would want to poke and prod her in annattempt to understand what she went though, what she's goingnthrough now, and to determine what they should do with her. She'snconfused and scared. That would only make it worse. It took me anwhole month for her to trust me just a little bit because she was sonscared. Because she'd forgotten who I was. After three years ofntheir torture she didn't even remember who I was.\" Jacobnremembered going to her that first night, remembered the feeling innhis heart when she only stared at him in fear when he said he wasngoing to get her out of there. Claspingnhis hands together in his lap he continued, \"If I could have gottennher out of there any sooner, I would have. If I had known theynwere...but I didn't...until that last night. But if I had...I wouldnhave acted sooner. Whether she trusted me or not. She never deservednthat. And she doesn't deserve this.\" Walter'snface softened at Jacob's words. \"Younwere cleared of the rape charges. I'm sure you'll be cleared ofneverything else. But I don't know what the doctor is going to saynabout releasing her to you. And what about your job?\" his bossnasked in a much kinder manner. Jacobnlooked over at him, surprised by his change of temper. The mannactually seemed to be siding with him now. \"I'mnsorry Walter. But she's going to need me 24 hours I think. If theynrelease her to me I will have to quit. I'll help you get anreplacement.\" \"Whatnwill you do then?\" \"Worknfrom home. I've been thinking about it, and Angela used to worknfrom home a long time ago. She was a computer programmer, one of thenbest. That's what I'll do. I can work, earn money, and take carenof her at the same time.\" Walternonly nodded before leaning back against his pillows and staring offninto space. \"Ifnwhat you say is true,\" he said all of a sudden. \"that thesenpeople did what you say they did to her for three years, if you'rencleared...I...I would want her to be released to you. If she reallyndid know you once under good terms for a long length of time, itnwould make sense that you take care of her. Especially if you carenabout her as much as I think you do. I don't think I would want tonsee things turn out any different and I know you'd get me the bestnprogrammer in the world.\" Jacobnturned his head to look back at his boss, surprised yet again. But henknew Walter wasn't always as angry as he had been for the lastnweek. \"No.nThat I can't do.\" \"What?\"nWalter wore a confused look on his face. \"Incan't get you the best programmer. Because Angela is the best. Shenwas amazing the last time I saw her. I looked up to her abilities.nNine years older than me she had way more experience than I did atnthe time. If they hadn't gotten her on that day, you would havenhired her over me in a split second. And it would have been yourndecision not someone else. But I can get you the next bestnprogrammer.\" \"I'llntake whoever you can get, Jacob. I just wish I could have met Angelanback then.\" \"Yeah,nme too.\" Regret filled his voice as he whispered the words. Regretnthat he hadn't had voice communication with Angela that day. He'dnknown they were going into danger taking down the Praetorians with anband of Mariano's men and he'd been worried. He should have beennmore prepared. Jacobnwent back to staring at his shoes and Walter lay his head back tonstare at the ceiling. Inside his mind Jacob remembered Angela as shenhad been, strong, vibrant, the woman no Praetorian would ever bringndown. He saw her beautiful smile, the way she'd been with Marianonthe first time he'd secretly seen her in person before showingnhimself as Sorcerer. But the moment she was to succeed they'dngained the upper hand. They'd been the ones to gain control. He sawnher at the mansion standing up in the yard with a chain attached tonher neck the moment he realized who she really was. He saw hernbruises, deep and purple. He saw her sitting on the floor in a puddlenof blood from her arm. And he saw her walking slowly up the stairsnwith Sean Trelawney behind her with his hand on her shoulder. Thenlook on her face was one he would always remember but couldn'tndescribe. Such sadness and despair that she'd accepted as the restnof her life. They'd ruined her. \"She'snnot ruined,\" he heard Walter's voice from somewhere nearby. \"I'mnno psychologist but I'm sure the real Angela must be in therensomewhere just waiting for the right moment to come out.\" Jacobnblinked his eyes several times before he saw Walter reaching out tonhim with a Kleenex in his hand. \"Thenright moment when she knows she's safe and you'll be there fornher like you always have been.\" Itnwas then Jacob realized his shirt was soaked and wet tracks had madentheir way down his cheeks and neck. He'd been caught crying by hisnboss. His cheeks turned red at the thought. \"SomenFBI agent I am. I'm falling apart at the seems.\" \"Nonyou're not. Jacob, of all the people I know, in a situation likenthis, you're the strongest. Most of them would have given up. Wouldnleave her to the doctors, walk away, and forget she exists. Mostnwouldn't do everything they could to get her out of thosenconditions themselves. And yes, most of the people I know are cops ornFBI agents.\" \"Tellsna lot about our profession.\" Jacob sighed, \"I just want her safe.nIs that too much to ask?\" \"No.\" âœ¢ \"ThenDNA we found...\" Jane paused for a moment and started again. \"ThenDNA we found inside Angela belonged to fifteen different people, allndescribed the same and all in different forms of law enforcement.\" Itnhad been two days since Jacob's conversation with Walter and henfelt like he'd started to go insane since then already. They'dnhad no news. No visitors. Nothing to do. Nothing. Nothing except hopenand pray for Angela's safety. Even though Jacob hated Jane Faradaynfor doing this to them when she walked into their hotel room he'dnbeen glad to see her. He'd almost smiled too, and he saw a smallnbit of relief on Walter's face as well. Her news, however, was notnsurprising. He knew Sean Trelawney. She didn't. He was just gladnshe didn't have bad news for him, either that they'd proved he'dnhurt Angela or that something horrible had happened to her. Now,nas they listened to Jane he and Walter sat on their beds, the tvnmuted between them. Walter seemed more interested in what she had tonsay than Jacob. \"Allnmale,\" she continued. \"Dan Dalsburg was in the FBI, ChadnKensington was in the NSA, Michael Vale was in the RCMP...\" Jacobncut her off, \"RCMP?\" he questioned. \"RoyalnCanadian Mounted Police.\" Jacobnnodded, remembering their time in Canada running from Sean whilentrying to save the life of a girl younger than Jacob had been at thentime. \"Thesennames were obviously aliases all for one man. We checked each agencynand none of them had records of him.\" \"Theynwouldn't,\" Jacob said. \"Trelawney knew how to cover hisntracks.\" \"Whatndid CSI find at that mansion?\" Walter asked. \"They'renstill processing the evidence. When they're done I'll let younknow.\" Jane'snvisits were always short and aggravating. Even though Jacob was gladnfor some interaction besides the one he was constantly having withnthe tv, she still annoyed him quite a bit. She only stopped by tongive them the facts on what they were finding. She would have calledninstead had she not wanted to see their reactions to what she said.nShe also just wanted to check up on them to make sure the guard wasnstill outside their door and they hadn't decided to flee anywhere. \"Bynthe way Resh, Dr. Vecchio wants to see you. There's a uniform whonwill take you to his office.\"[Chapter 8] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 8 Thenofficer parked in front of a large sign which read 'ChicagonHospital of Mental Health' and opened Jacob's door for him. Ifnthis was where the psychologist's office was, then this was alsonwhere Angela was being kept away from him and he didn't want to goninside. Itnlooked like an old place, built in the 1940's perhaps and he wasnafraid of what he would find inside. Patients chained to their beds,nlaying in their own waste until an uncaring nurse found them severalnhours later, attendants making fun of and taking advantage of them.nAngela, alone, chained in a corner, perhaps beaten for not talking.nBut Dr. Vecchio was a nice guy. He wouldn't let anything happen tonher. Would he? Jacobngot out of the back of the cruiser and let the cop lead him inside tonthe doctor's office. The walls were a calm but warm peach colornwith a cream trim. The floors were white and nearly squeaky clean. Anfew wheelchairs lined the hallway. Thenrecreation room halfway down the hallway was open and Jacob could seenseveral patients dressed in baggy sweat pants and t-shirts huddlednhappily around a tv while two others battled each other on the pingnpong table, the ball slapping against their paddles in an almostnhypnotic rhythm. Nonenof the other doors were open. He listened for screams of pain orncalls for help and heard none. \"Dr.nVecchio will be right with you,\" the doctor's secretary said whennthey arrived at his office on the fourth floor. Jacobnlooked up when he heard a door open. The doctor stood in the doorwaynwith a surprised look on his face. \"What?\"nJacob asked, standing up. \"Please,ncome in.\" Insidenthe office, Jacob was expecting a dark wooden desk and two chairs fornhim to pick from. He was expecting it to be posh, large, with lots ofndiplomas on the wall. But that wasn't the case. Instead, he found ansmall, simple room with two leather chairs, both of which looked softnand comfortable. There were two tables one at either chair and eachnheld a box of tissues while one also held two folders, a yellow memonpad, and a pen. Jacob recognized his name as well as Angela's onnthe folders. \"Younlook tired,\" Dr. Vecchio commented as he sat down in the chairnopposite Jacob and picked up the note pad and pen. Jacobnblinked and wiped at his eyes with his fingers. He was tired. Tirednof everything, and tired of being able to do nothing. \"I'mnsorry, Doc.\" \"Nonneed to be sorry, Jacob. I would just like to ask why you're sontired. How have you been sleeping lately?\" \"Sleep?nWhat's that? I hardly know what you're talking about,\" Jacobnreplied in a dry tone. \"I can't sleep. I worry too much. I'mnbored. Spend all my time in bed propped up by pillows watching tv. Mynboss's boss has us locked in the damn hotel room with a watch guardnout front to make sure we don't escape on her until she can prove Inraped and beat my sister.\" \"You'renharboring a lot of anger. Are you sure she's out to get you?\" Jacobnsighed. \"When my boss thought it was a good idea to start the CICnto police the internet everyone laughed at him. They thought it was andumb idea. When he asked for agents who knew computers to populatenhis agency they laughed even harder. Then I came along. Once theynwere able to prove that I was innocent in my case they sent me tonQuantico for FBI training because I'm good with computers. They didnit to make fun of Walter, thought they gave him the lowest of the lownwhen they sent me to CIC. No one thinks highly of us. No one thoughtnwe'd be able to pull off the arrest record we've got. They gavenus two more recruits, but they still laugh. Even Jane, his boss. I'mnglad I have a job I like, one that pays well, without even finishingnhighschool. And it helped me to find Angela. I wouldn't benharboring any anger if they respected the CIC and what we do. Inwouldn't have this anger if Jane Faraday didn't have it in hernmind that I would deliberately hurt my own sister! She was the onenwho took Angela away from me and is keeping me cooped up in a darknhotel room night and day. I just want to be with Angela. Is that sonhard to ask?\" \"Yes.nIt is, I'm afraid. I understand where you're coming from but nownthat this has turned into a governmental matter there's no goingnback. I'm keeping a close watch on Angela to make sure she'snhealing well mentally and physically.\" \"CannI see her? Please? You don't have to let me in the room with her.nYou don't even have to let her know I'm there. I just want to seenher. I need proof that she's ok. Please, doctor, you don't knownwhat this is doing to me!\" \"I'mnafraid I can't. Not right now.\" \"Butnwhy not? I know you're watching her, but this won't affect that.nShe won't even know I'm there. Hell, she hardly knows who I amnanyway.\" \"I...Incan't. That's all,\" there was a worried look in the doctor'sneyes. \"Somethingnhappened!\" Jacob's head snapped towards the psychologist. \"Whatnhappened?! Tell me what happened to her! Did someone hurt her? Whatnhappened?! Is she ok?\" \"She'snfine. Just fine,\" he said, the worried look still there. \"Nonshe's not. I can tell. You've got to let me see her! Please!\"nJacob begged. \"I need to see her!\" Dr.nVecchio sighed before motioning for Jacob to get up and follow him.nLeaving the office they went to a small room next door. Jacob foundnthat his hands were balled into fists at his sides as he contemplatednwhat could have happened to her. If anyone touched her he would bensure to rip their heart out. Thenroom was small and dark with only a bare lightbulb hanging from thenceiling. Jacob was familiar with the setting. Normally he would benlooking through a dark window onto an interrogation room. But here,nthe glass looked into a stark white, padded room. It was almostnimpossible to tell the padded bed apart from the rest of the room.nBut he had no problem finding Angela, tucked into the corner of thenroom, still wearing his pajamas. She was curled up into a ball, hernknees as close to her chest as she could get them. But she wasn'tnhugging them. Both her hands seemed to be cradled in her lap. Thenlook on her face betrayed her inner feelings. She was sad, lost, andnconfused. And she wanted to disappear into the wall again. But thisnwas nothing that new. Jacob had seen her like this before. Did itnmean she wasn't getting any better? She certainly looked like shenmight be eating better. If only a little. And her neck seemed to havenhealed. The bandages had been taken off and only minimal scaring wasnleft, thank God. Shenmoved slightly and looked to be rubbing her wrists against her legs.nThat's when he saw them. The fresh bandages. On her wrists. Fresh.nThey were fresh. \"Hernwrists. What happened?\" Jacob asked, his voice oddly calm. \"It'snbeen rough since she came from the hospital. She...she...tried to cutnherself. Several times. That's why we put her in here. Shenrepresents a danger to herself and to everyone else right now.\" Ansingle tear tracked it's way down Jacob's face as he watched hernrubbing her bandaged wrists against her legs harder now, intent onnrubbing them off, or worse. \"OhnGod,\" he whispered. \"Why? Why did she do it?\" \"I'mnafraid I don't know. She won't say anything to anyone. She won'tnlet anyone near her. They tried to give her fresh clothes. When shencut herself on a nail from the bed in her other room they had tonsedate her quickly in order to stop the bleeding and get her cleanednup. We thought maybe it was just an accident that first time. But shendid it again the next day. And the next. We moved her here, but she'sndetermined to get those bandages off. She wants out of this world,nand I'm doing all I can to keep her here as long as possible.nSomething horrible happened to her and I want to bring her back tonour world where she belongs. It's just going to take some time.\" Angelanrubbed her wrists with more determination as tears began to roll downnher cheeks. \"Letnme see her. I might be able to help her.\" \"Incan't let that happen. I'm sorry.\" \"Nonyour not! You just want to observe her for a long time. To determinenwhat should happen to her. To determine what ward she should be putninto. The insane ward or the one where they inject her and she'sngone from the world, from me, forever because you don't thinknthere's a damn thing that can help her.\" \"Youndon't understand Agent Resh. She's trapped in her own world rightnnow. There's nothing I can do to get her out. She doesn'tnunderstand anything. She won't talk to me. She won't let anyonennear her.\" \"Thennhelp her to understand!\" Jacobnturned from Angela to face the doctor, this time with more tearsnfreely flowing down his face. \"Watchingnher isn't going to do shit, doctor! When I was with her, she talkednto me! We talked. It took a long time, but I got her to trust me anlittle. She let me pick her up and carry her out of that place.\" \"Thosencircumstances were different. Her life was at stake.\" Jacobnwiped his tears away before looking back at Angela who'd stoppednrubbing her wrists. She drew her knees closer to her chest and satnthere, sad and confused, waiting for the end, waiting for someone tonrescue her. He wanted nothing in the world just then other than to benable to run to her side and hold her tight, to let her know thatneverything would be ok. That he would always be there for her, nonmatter what. She needed to understand that. \"She'snnot your sister, is she?\" the doctor inquired all of a sudden. Jacob'snhand had found it's way to the glass as he watched her on the othernside. Beforenhe knew what he was saying the words tumbled from his mouth, \"Youndon't know how hard I've fallen for her. And when she wentnmissing for three years, I nearly lost it. When I found her again,nwhen I saw what they'd done to her it was like they'd taken mynheart and smashed it to bits with a sledge hammer even long after itnhad stopped beating. We used to be so close. And then she didn'tneven remember who I was. It tore me up. I had to save her any way Incould. I had to get her out of there. I knew it wouldn't be easynbecause she wasn't the same anymore. People would question hernsudden appearance and want to take her away from me. So I made her mynsister to protect her. To keep her safe. I know she'll never be thensame again, Doctor. I know that. But I have to do whatever it takesnto help her and keep her safe.\" \"That'snthe only thing she's ever told me.\" \"What?\"nJacob looked back at the doctor. \"WhennI asked about you, if you'd ever hurt her all she said was 'he'snsafe'. When I asked about other people hurting her she never saidnanything, just had a faraway look in her eyes.\" Jacobnsmiled through his tears as he glanced back at Angela, his hand stillnon the glass. He'd gotten through to her. She knew he was safe,nthat he wouldn't hurt her or let anyone else harm her. She knew! Oh,nAngel. I love you so much.[Chapter 9] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 9 Backnat the hotel room late that night several emotions were floodingnJacob all at once. He was happy because Angela understood that henmeant her no harm. He was sad because she was still there, being heldnaway from him, and probably still not knowing who he was. He was alsonangry because they wouldn't let him help her when he knew he could.nHe'd gotten this far with her. She knew he was safe, that wasnsomething more than they had. All they were doing was observing her,ntrying to determine what should happen to her, but doing nothing tonhelp her. Sure the doctor was a nice guy, but she needed help, notnobserving! Ifnonly he could get to see her in person, to be able to touch her, tonhold her tight against him, to talk to her, she might come out of hernshell a little more. She might try to leave her private world behindnand rejoin his. If only. Why couldn't the doctor try to help hernthe best he could and then determine what should be done with her?nNot helping her wasn't going to do shit. Jacob'snhand curled into a fist and he punched the pillow beside his in thendark several times. He wanted to cry all of these emotions out ofnhim so there was a chance of getting some sleep at the end, but henwas as dry as the Nevada desert and no tears would come. \"Jacob?nYou ok?\" he heard Walter's voice in the darkness with a hint ofnworry to it. Jacobnrolled over onto his back. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\" \"Youndidn't sound fine. Look, I know it's annoying when the CSIs takenso damn long to get through evidence, but they have to put the piecesnof the puzzle together from scratch to figure out what happened. Younknow that. In a few days, hopefully they'll be able to putneverything together. Jane said your case was the top priority rightnnow.\" \"Right.nGood I suppose. But not fast enough.\" \"Look,nthere's nothing we can do to speed anything up. The doctor has tonbe clear about what happened to Angela. He has to make sure it wasn'tnyou...\" Jacobncut him off, \"He knows it wasn't me. Angela told him.\" \"Butnshe could be saying that from fear that you'd go after her again ifnshe told the truth. I know you didn't hurt her, but she doesn't.\" \"NonWalter, she hasn't spoken more than two words to anyone since shenleft me. When he asked if I hurt her all she said was 'he'snsafe'. When he asked if other people hurt her she didn't answer,nbut he read it in her face. God, Walter, they need to be helping hernright now, not trying to figure out the past. She's sitting in thencorner of a padded room trying to slit her wrists any way possible. Inwas able to talk to her a little. She would respond to me. It tooknawhile, but she did. They're not doing anything for her. Justnobserving. That's not going to do shit.\" Jacobnsighed, his anger boiling down to desperation. \"Intold you once before, the evidence looks good in your favor. Ifnthings go according to how I think they will, you'll walk out ofnhere and I'm sure they'll release her to you.\" \"Nonthey won't. They put her in that padded room because she's andanger to herself and to others, he said. And if they're not doingna damn thing to help her, she won't get better. She'll steadilynget worse again. They'll never let her out of there.\" \"Justngo with the flow for awhile Jacob. That's all you can do. Ride thenwave, at least until you're completely cleared of this mess. Thennyou can worry about getting her released. Because even if she wasnperfectly fine and back to normal, they would never release her tonsomeone who might have raped and beat her. I know it will be hard,nbut clear yourself first, then get her out of there. Ok?\" Asnmuch as he didn't want to, Jacob saw the logic, and nodded hisnhead, forgetting Walter couldn't see him in the darkness of thenroom. \"Jacob?nOk?\" \"Yeah,nI got it. Ok,\" he sighed. \"I'll ride the wave. But I promisenyou it won't be a long one.\" \"Indon't believe it will be a long one. If you are innocent, itnshouldn't take the CSIs long to figure that out. Just get somensleep. You'll need it soon enough.\" âœ¢ Severalnmore days went by slowly though by now Jane had allowed an officer tonaccompany Jacob to the hotel's small gym so that he could at leastnget some exercise in. He felt like a lump on the bed and was afraidnhe wouldn't be able to help Angela at all if he didn't get somenmovement in besides pacing the small room. Nownhe felt like he was doing something for Angela, even if it wasn'tndirectly helping her right that second, it would help her later on,nand it made him feel better. Gave him different scenery to look atnbesides the dark hotel room. Thenofficer's cell phone beeped. Jacob kept jogging on the treadmillnbut turned his attention to the cop's conversation. He was stillnwaiting on news from the CSIs findings. Hopefully this would be thenphone call he'd been waiting for. \"AgentnFaraday's upstairs. CSI findings came in. Let's go.\" Jacob'snnerves kicked into high gear as he slowed down and got off thentreadmill, grabbing a towel to wipe the sweat off his forehead. Thisnwas it. This was the moment that would make or break him, dependingnon what they found. He could only pray for Angela's sake that theynhad good news for him. Uponnentering the room Jane Faraday took a quick step away from Jacob whennhe entered still covered in sweat from his morning jog. She held andisgusted look on her face and he couldn't be sure whether it wasnbecause he was sweaty or because she didn't like the news she wasnabout to deliver. Or both. \"AgentnResh, good to see you,\" she said in an icy tone when he sat down tonface her while continuing to towel himself off. Henonly nodded in greeting and waited for her to make her announcement. \"Asnyou are probably aware, Resh, that fire you set to the mansionndestroyed nearly everything.\" Jacob nodded. \"However, you shouldnbe glad the town is small. They don't have a fire engine and no onenheard anything at all. So that made the CSIs job easier tracking thenevidence. There were a few rooms that were not touched.\" Jacobnflinched, imagining which rooms had been left. Perhaps they'd foundneveryone alive, trapped in their bedrooms, begging to be let out, tontell their half of the story. His stomach tied itself into one giantnknot. \"Severalnbedrooms were untouched, three to be exact. And one odd room tuckedninto a wall underneath the remains of a painting. They found everyoneninside dead, most of them died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Onenman was out in the hallway in front of the small room in the wall.nHe'd been shot to death in the back of the head. When they ran hisnprints, thank God he wasn't burned after he was shot, they foundnthat his identity matched those 15 others from various lawnenforcement agencies.\" Jacob'snheart pounded, this could still turn out bad for him. He refused tonlook at either Jane or Walter as she continued her long story. Henknew she would keep the important information he so desperatelynneeded to hear until the very end. \"Hisnbedroom was the only one that held any real evidence pertaining tonthe case. They found evidence of sex between him and Angela.nHandcuffs still attached to the headboard had bits of her skin innthem.\" Jacobnshook his head. He didn't want to hear this. He didn't want tonhear it. She'd been so scared, so compliant. She wouldn't havendared escape that night, no matter what that man did to her, yet henhandcuffed her to the bed anyway! The sick bastard. His stomach,nstill tied in a knot began to churn and he could feel the bile risingnup into his throat as he jumped from the bed and made a dash for thenbathroom. \"Younhave to hear this, Resh,\" Jane said when he came back fromndepositing everything he'd eaten that morning into the toilet. Hisnheart was still pumping wildly and he could feel the paleness in hisnown face. \"Yes,nshe was raped by him. Yes, he handcuffed her to the bed to make surenshe didn't try to escape. And yes, they found evidence that he'dnbeaten her too, thrown her up against the headboard and smacked hernaround.\" Jacobnclosed his eyes but opened them again when unwanted pictures ofnAngela in Sean's bed came flooding into his vision. If Sean hadnstill been alive Jacob was sure he would have found him and beat himnto a pulp. But he wasn't. And he couldn't. \"She'dnnever been in the other bedrooms we found.\" Atnleast it had only been Sean hurting her in that way. \"Thenmen we found in them don't seem to have any identities at all. Theynprinted them, but found nothing. Did a DNA search and still came upnempty. They're still working on it. The last room they foundnuntouched was the small room under the painting in the wall. A mostnunusual room. And obviously where they had been keeping Angela.nLocked in a cage, just as you'd said.\" Jacobnprayed all this evidence would set him free. Would prove he wasn'tnconspiring with the Praetorians to hurt her like this. \"Outsidenthe mansion they found the collar you'd taken off her. There wasnevidence that she'd been wearing it a long time and it was heavy.nThey found your prints on it, of course, because you took it off thennight you escaped. They also found the prints of the man who rapednher. And the other men. They also found the chain that they'dnattached to her collar when she was outside. You're lucky, Resh.nThis looks like it might be proving you innocent. But you did burnndown the house, and killed everyone inside.\" \"Jane,nlook at the evidence!\" Walter finally spoke up. \"What were thesenmen doing? Half of them have no identities or fifteen for one man!nSomething fishy was going on there. You've got that one man fornraping her and beating her. What more do you need? Jacob was onlyndoing what he had to in order to save Angela and himself. I'mnsurprised she wasn't dead a long time ago. What on earth wouldnposes them to keep her that way for so long? God...\" Jacobnlooked up at his boss and realized he hadn't told them everything. \"Theynwere looking for me,\" he said. \"A long time ago in the 80's theynhad this operation called Copper Canyon. They called togethernmilitary philosophers, theologians, chaos theorists, analysts,ncomputer geeks. They were looking to create a world widencommunication system called Global Village. Anyone working on thenproject had no clue what they were doing. They didn't even know whonanyone else was because they used fake names.\" \"I'vennever heard of it. What does this have to do with them searching fornyou? You were only a kid at the time.\" Walter asked while Janenlooked on with evident interest. \"Inwas a kid, yes. But my father was one of those they called on to worknfor them. His fake name was Sorcerer. When I grew up and got intoncomputers I used that as my screenname. I didn't know what hadnhappened to him. He just one day up and left my life so I was kind ofnbent on finding him. Everything lead me to the Praetorian Guard andnCopper Canyon. Once they found out I knew their secrets they wantednme gone. But I'd found out another key piece of evidence. Angela'snfather also worked for them. So I contacted her to see if she knewnanything...\" Jacob stopped, realizing that he'd just outednhimself and Angela. NownJane Faraday was watching him with an even more intent interest. Shenwas staring at him, and so was Walter. \"Yes,nI talked to Dr. Vecchio the other day. He told me what you said,\"nJane said with a smirk. \"I'mnsorry,\" Jacob looked toward the ground. \"Yes, it's true.\"[Chapter 10] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 10 \"What'sntrue?\" Walter asked clueless as to what they were talking about. \"Angela'snnot my sister.\" \"WHAT?!nBut your file...\" Therenwas nothing more Jacob could do now except to explain the facts asnthey had really happened. He felt ashamed because he'd creatednanother fake identity for Angela. But one meant to protect her, notnsend the cops chasing her to arrest her. \"I...letnme tell the story. I'll explain everything.\" \"Sonyou lied with the last long story you gave us,\" Jane suggested. \"Notnentirely. No. Look, I contacted Angela, gave her a message Inimmediately wanted to take back. I was hiding under my screenname. Inknew no one could track me. But she wasn't. She was a programmer,nthe best in the world, but she didn't know the extent of theninformation I was giving her. Once The Praetorians caught wind ofnher, they had to catch her so their secret wouldn't get out. Theynhad her real name so they changed it to that of Liz Marx, a knownnfelon, so that if she ever escaped their grasp the cops were sure tonpick her up and they could swoop down and grab her. That's why SeannTrelawney had so many fake ids. \"Theyndidn't know I wasn't my father. They just knew someone going bynthe name of Sorcerer who had worked for them in the past was walkingnaround with secret information and they wanted me dead. So they triednto use Angela to get to me. But she didn't know who I was for anlong time. I helped her a lot, and we managed to foil thenPraetorian's new plots every time, but they were still after us.nWhen she got to New York where I was living I let her know who I wasnand we began working together in person to take them down. \"Thenlast time I saw her, we'd gathered some friends and finally had anlocation of their headquarters. We were going in to get Angela'snidentity back. I called the FBI to let them know that Liz Marx wouldnbe there at a certain time, knowing she'd have her own identitynback by then and they would finally learn about the Praetorian Guard.nIt was a fool proof plan. Except I didn't think aboutncommunication. Angela went down underneath the travel agency withnMariano and I stayed on top, using codes to break down doors so shencould have access. I didn't have any contact with her and that wasnmy fault. I should have thought of it. \"IfnI had, maybe they wouldn't have been able to grab her and escapenout the back door. Maybe they wouldn't have hurt her for threenyears while I slogged through FBI training and a new job, trying tonact normal while inside I was falling apart with worry. Wonderingnwhere she was, and what had happened to her. For three years theynwere using her to search for me. I knew someone was looking for me onnthe internet, but I had no idea it was her. It wasn't her handnprint on the searches so I didn't think it was her. I thought itnwas some kid who'd heard about the great Sorcerer online and wantednto find me to get my autograph or something. Not that that would evernhappen. It wasn't until I found her that I realized her hand printsnwouldn't be on those searches because the Praetorians were rightnbehind her watching her search for me. She was doing what they asked,nbut she was still hiding from me to protect me. Doing what theynwanted, but coming up empty every time.\" Jacobnsighed, his hands trembling. For Walter's benefit, he continued thenstory, \"For three years they told her her name was Elizabeth Marx.nThey erased her memory some how. She doesn't know who I am. Shendoesn't know who Angela Bennett is. When I broke her out of therenand changed her identity back, I knew I had to do something to keepnher safe from the world. Making her my sister was the only thing Incould think of, to ensure no one would try to take her away from me.nI didn't want her to be hurt again.\" Everyonenwas silent for a long time. Jacob could feel both of them watchingnhim and he didn't know what to do. He'd just bared his soul tonhis boss and his boss's boss. Things couldn't go well from here.nHe tried to calm down and get his trembling hands under control butnnothing seemed to work. Finally he held his hands out to Jane. \"Arrestnme if you want. I know I killed all of them in the mansion. I meantnto. They deserved what they got. And if you have to arrest me fornthat, then go ahead. I wouldn't have done anything else.\" \"Putnyour hands down,\" Jane said. \"I believe I still have morenevidence to give you.\" Jacobnlooked up at her with surprise. She hated him, he knew that. So whynwasn't she arresting him? It made no sense. \"Inhad the CSIs dig up back cases on Liz Marx. What they found wasninteresting. Her files said she'd committed several crimes worthngoing to prison for. But there was no evidence of any kind to provenit. There was nothing else in her files either. No address, nonfamily, no nothing. It's like she only existed to commit crimes andnthen disappeared. Your story is holding true Resh.\" Hopensprings eternal. \"I'vengot a judge looking at all the evidence outside of the courtroomnright now to determine what should happen with you. Since you'venrevised your story some, I'll need you to go downtown and repeat itnall to an officer who will record it for the judge. And please, takena shower before you go.\" âœ¢ \"Sincenit's been a few days,\" Dr. Vecchio said as Jacob sat in hisnoffice in the comfortable chair opposite the psychologist. \"I wouldnlike to see you two interact.\" Jacobnstared at the man in complete surprise. \"What?nI thought you couldn't...didn't want to...\" \"Well,nI do. I've seen you a few times, I've been observing Angela and Inwant to observe you two together.\" \"Butnwhy? I'm confused.\" \"Because,nI need to see how you interact to be able to determine what shouldnhappen to her. Please be aware that while you're with her, I willnbe watching you and listening to everything you say. And this doesnnot mean you will be leaving with her today. It does not mean younwill ever leave with her. That will take awhile for me to decide.nDon't get her hopes up. You will have fifteen minutes with her. Nonmore. You also may not give her anything. I don't care what it is.nShe gets nothing. Understand?\" \"Yes,\"nJacob managed to choke out, too shocked and excited by the chance tonsee her again. Dr.nVecchio lead him out of the office to another door just past thenviewing room they'd been in before. He opened a heavy metal doornand motioned Jacob inside before closing it behind the FBI agent. Jacobnfound himself in the stark white padded room he'd seen Angela innseveral days before. Her padded white bed was in the left cornernahead of him, and there was Angela, curled up in a ball, in hisnpajamas in the right corner, her head buried in her knees. She hadn'tneven seen or heard him come in. Jacob walked forward a few steps,nmoving slowly. It had been a long while since he'd been in a roomnwith her. She was still pale and thin, but her bruises had started tongo away at least. No one was hurting her here. He thanked God fornthat. He stepped closer but didn't want to startle her. \"Angel?\"nhe called out in a near whisper. Slowlynshe raised her head and looked at him. There was still a small amountnof fear in her eyes coupled with confusion and that feeling of beingnlost he'd seen a few days ago. She stared at him, before rubbing atnher eyes with her fingers. She looked at him again. \"Jacob?\"nher voice was tentative, quiet, but he heard her. Henwalked quickly to her side and fell to the floor. He thought he'dnbeen dry as the desert but now tears welled up in his eyes andnspilled over the edge down his face. \"Yes,nI'm here,\" he choked out. \"I'm here.\" Withoutnthinking, he wrapped her up in his arms and pulled her towards him inna tight embrace. Her arms reached out slowly, as if she was unsurenwhat to do before she'd returned the hug. \"Younremembered,\" he voiced when he finally let her go. Shennodded. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered. \"I forgot you, to protectnyou.\" Thisnwas the most she'd ever said to him. Probably the most she'd evernsaid to anyone in three years. His heart soared. He felt like he wasnsitting on a cloud just then. She'd remembered him after all. Andnshe was talking. There was hope after all. If the doctor had anynsense at all he would be sure to release her into Jacob's custody.nShe would be ok. \"It'snok. Everything's going to be ok. They're gone now. All of themnare dead. They can't hurt you anymore,\" he reminded her. Aboveneverything else he wanted to tell her how the case was going, thatnthere was a chance she could go home with him if things passed withnthe doctor and the judge, but that would give her false hope if itndidn't happen. He didn't want to think about how much that wouldnhurt her if he told her there was the possibility of her going homenwith him and then it didn't happen. This time he would be the causenof her pain. And he didn't want that. \"Theynknow you're not my sister now,\" he told her instead. \"It kindnof came out by accident. I was only trying to protect you. I'm surenthey'll change your name back.\" Angelanshook her head but didn't say anything, looking agitated. \"They'llnonly take off my last name. They know you're not Liz Marx. It'snok.\" Shenvisibly relaxed a little. \"Younneed to tell Dr. Vecchio what happened. That can only help.\" Shenlooked up into his eyes, fear suddenly filling hers as she curlednback up into a ball and tried her hardest to disappear into thencorner. \"Babynsteps, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Angel. It's ok. You don'tnhave to tell him anything,\" he sighed. \"I'm doing my best tonget you out of here, but I can't promise anything. The cops think Inhad something to do with what happened to you the past three years.nI'm trying to get us both out of this situation. But I can't donit alone. I need you to help me.\" Angelantore her eyes away from his and looked down into her lap, at hernfreshly bandaged wrists. The look in her eyes told him she wasnashamed for something, that she didn't feel she could help. Jacobnreached out and gently took her wrists in his hands. She tried tonpull away but his gentleness kept her there. \"Whatnhappened, Angel?\" he questioned. Shenstared at her wrists and didn't respond. \"Comenon. You can tell me. I won't get mad at you or anything. Inpromise,\" Jacob begged. He took her chin in his hand and raised hernhead so her eyes met his. \"Please?\" Angelanonly shook her head and averted her eyes to the white padded floor. \"Jacob?\"nDr. Vecchio's voice broke the silence and Jacob looked up to seenthe man standing in the doorway. Itnwas time to go and it was breaking his heart to have to leave hernthere alone. He looked back at Angela who refused to look at him. \"Angel,nbefore I go, I need to give you something.\" That got her attention.nShe raised her head to look at him. Jacob could feel tension comingnfrom the other side of the room, from the psychologist. \"It's notnsomething physical,\" he clarified for both of them. \"But it'snall I've got.\" Their eyes met, and hers seemed locked onto hisnfor the first time since he'd walked into the room, as if shenwouldn't take them away for anything, no matter what he said. \"Inlove you, Angel,\" he whispered. \"And don't you ever forgetnthat. No matter what happens. Ok?\" Shennodded her head and he got to his feet. At the door he stopped andnturned back to see Angela staring after him, the look in her eyesnclearly saying she didn't want him to leave. His heart broke into anmillion little pieces once again as Dr. Vecchio pulled him from thenroom and shut the door.[Chapter 11] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 11 Jacobnsat in the back of another police cruiser as he was driven to thenChicago Hospital of Mental Health once again the following week. Dr.nVecchio had called earlier that day and invited him over for dinner,nexplaining that he was to have dinner with Angela. The good doctornhad had nurses attempt to teach Angela how to use utensils and eatnproperly but they'd failed. He wanted to see how Jacob would do. Tonwatch them interact again to see if there was any hint of past abusenfrom Jacob, and also to see if Jacob could indeed teach her to eatnmore successfully than his nurses. Whennhe arrived there was a small square table set up in an otherwisenempty room just down the hall from Angela's white padded room. Twonchairs had been placed at either end. Two sets of silverwarenaccompanied two napkins and two full glasses of water. The doctorntold Jacob to have a seat and he would bring Angela out in a fewnminutes. Whennhe brought her in she looked unsure of herself. She'd showered notneven an hour ago and her hair was still wet. But it didn't matternto him. Even in his over large pajamas on her small frame she wasnstill the woman he'd fallen in love with so many years ago. He knewnthis was a new setting for her, and knew it would be awkward for bothnof them. Whennshe sat down the doctor nodded at Jacob and left as a nurse broughtnthem each a plate of macaroni and cheese along with peas and greennbeans. Food Angela probably hadn't had in three years. It would bennear impossible and messy to eat the pasta with her fingers so therenwas no way the Praetorians would allow that on her menu. \"Dessertnwill be out when you're ready,\" the nurse said before leavingnthem alone, closing the door on her way out. Angelanlooked up from her plate of food to Jacob sitting across from her. \"Hi,\"nhe said, not knowing what they should talk about, or if he shouldnjust dig in and start eating. She was still thin, but she looked anlittle better than the last time he'd seen her. She wasn't asnpale anymore and some bruises had disappeared all together. He wasnhappy for that. She no longer had bandages around her wrists too. Nownhe could clearly see the stitches it had taken to sew up her deeplyncut skin, could see the scar tissue that had finally begun to grow. \"Hi,\"nshe whispered, still looking unsure of the whole situation. \"It'snok,\" Jacob told her. \"I know you haven't done this in awhile,nbut you'll catch on quickly. Just follow me and do what I do.\" Jacobnpicked up his fork and stabbed a few pieces of macaroni and cheesenand ate them. Angela watched him before looking down at her utensilsnand studying them a few seconds before selecting the fork. She heldnit as if she was holding a knife and about to stab something. Shenattempted to get some pasta onto her fork but it hit the edge of thenplate and slipped from her sweaty grip. She looked up at Jacob andnthen back down at her plate in shame. \"Here,nhold it like this,\" Jacob held up his fork to show her. Shenshook her head. He got up and went around the table to stand behindnher. He picked up her fallen fork and gently took her right hand innhis and positioned the utensil correctly in her hand. She carefullynwatched his movements as he proceeded to take her hand with the forknand scoop up some of the macaroni and cheese. \"See,nit's not that hard,\" he said, letting her hand go as it stayed innthe air, holding the fork with the pasta on it. Somenof the piled high pasta fell off, back onto the plate. She quicklynshoveled the rest into her mouth before dropping the fork back to thenplate and chewing, thoughtfully, savoring the food she hadn't hadnat the mansion. Jacobnwent back to his seat and picked up his fork, but he didn't takenanother bite. Instead, he watched Angela struggle to get the hang ofnher fork. This was one thing he couldn't understand. How couldnsomeone forget how to eat with utensils? But then, he hadn't beenntrapped with the Praetorians for three years forced to eat with hisnhands crappy food that probably shouldn't even go to the birds. Hencould only be patient with her, take his time, and help her out thenbest he could. Thinkingnabout it, he'd ended up staring at his own plate for a few seconds.nThe clatter of a fork meeting a plate brought his head up with ansnap. \"Incan't do this!\" Angela cried out before abruptly standing up andnknocking her chair to the floor. She turned and ran for the corner ofnthe room where she hugged her knees to her chest and tried tondisappear. Jacobnwaited only a second before following her to the corner and sittingndown beside her. Tears streaked down her face as he turned to facenher. He gently brushed them away with his thumb. \"Yesnyou can. Angel, I know you can do this. It may take a few tries, butnyou'll get the hang of it. I promise.\" Angelanshook her head and stared at the ground though she looked like shenhad something to say. \"Tellnme what's wrong,\" Jacob coaxed. \"You can tell me anything. Incan't help you if I don't know what's wrong.\" When she didn'tnrespond he continued, \"Angel, this is not the Praetorian mansion.nYou're not going to be punished for saying something. Even if yountell me you hate me and want me to go away and leave you alone. Inwill do anything you ask. But you have to talk to me.\" Withoutnlooking at him she slowly began to speak, \"It's not just...notnjust this...it's...everything...I know I wasn't...wasn'tnalways...like this...but...but...I don't remember how I was...Inremember knowing you...but not the specifics...I remember having anlife...but not what it was...\" \"Don'tnyou worry. We'll take baby steps and I'll be with you every stepnof the way. Eventually you'll be yourself again. It'll benalright. You won't need to face the world until you feel good andnready. Until then, you can drop your fork as many times as you'dnlike.\" Ansmall smile found it's way to her lips and she raised her eyes tonhis. \"You...younmean it? I...I feel like...like a bumbling idiot...\" Jacobnput an arm around her and pulled her close. \"Of course I mean it. Inwouldn't have said it otherwise. And you're not a bumbling idiot.nYou're a smart woman. Now, what do you say we find out what's onnthe menu for dessert?\" \"Butnwhat about dinner?\" \"Whoncares. It's probably cold now anyway. And some nice comfort foodnwould be great right about now, for both of us.\" Jacob stood up.n\"You stay right here and I'll be right back.\" Henwent to the door and found the same nurse who'd delivered dinnernwaiting outside with two cups of cold chocolate pudding. \"Thatnour dessert?\" \"Yup.\" Hentook them from her and set them on the table. Angela started to getnup as he placed a spoon in each cup. \"Staynright where you are honey, the dessert is coming to you,\" hensmiled. \"But...Dr...Ve...\" \"Babynsteps, Angel. Remember? If it's more comfortable over here becausenit's what you're used to, you can learn to eat over here instead.nLearn one thing at a time. Sitting at a table is overrated anyway andnbesides, chocolate pudding is more fun to eat and easier.\" Hengave her one of the cups and she took it in her hands. \"Now,nwatch me. I'll make this simple and easy.\" Hengrasped his spoon like a baby in a highchair would and spoonednchocolate pudding into his mouth. Angela watched him and then did thensame, successfully getting most of the pudding into her mouth. Ansmall bit landed on the tip of her nose. Jacob grinned. \"Inshould have thought to bring a camera,\" he laughed. Shenfrowned. \"You'vengot pudding on your nose,\" he said, reaching out to wipe it awaynwith his finger. Angelanpulled away, back into her corner, watching him. Jacobnwas left wondering what he'd done to upset her. \"I'm...I'mnsorry, Angel. I...don't know...\" Shenonly shook her head and looked sadly down at her pudding beforensetting it down on the floor and wrapping her arms around her knees. He'dnforgotten about everything, about the past three years. What they'dndone to her. In one second he'd forgotten. And now she was curlednup in a ball in the corner, trying to get as far away from him asnpossible. All over one simple movement. Just the chocolate pudding onnher nose. Nothing more. Jacobncould feel hot stinging tears pricking at his eyes when the doornopened with a loud creak. Angela buried herself into the corner andnrefused to look up. Dr. Vecchio stood in the doorway motioning fornJacob to leave. Slowly the FBI agent put down his pudding and got tonhis feet. He wanted to talk to Angela so that he wouldn't benleaving on a bad note. But he was sure she wouldn't listen to him.nShe wasn't even watching him leave as he slowly walked away, hisnhead still turned to face her.[Chapter 12] ThenNet: Dog: Chapter 12 TogethernJacob Resh and Walter Cizelski sat in Dr. Vecchio's waiting room,nwaiting to speak to the doctor. Inside his office they could hearnseveral voices arguing over something. \"Look,nI don't have any reason for this not to happen!\" Dr. Vecchio'snvoice came through the wall. \"From everything I've seen he'sntelling the truth. And she trusts him. A lot more than she trusts menand the rest of the staff.\" \"Andnthe CSI's report doesn't say anything about him physicallynhurting her from what I read,\" another male voice said. \"Thatnwould be Judge Hollister,\" Walter clarified in a whisper. \"They'rentalking about our case. Angela's case,\" Jacob sounded surprised.n\"So that's why they wanted both of us here. They're talking itnover and they're going to tell us what's going to happen. OhnGod...\" Jacob was suddenly nervous. \"What if...what if...\" \"Shutnup!\" Walter hissed. \"And calm down. If you want this to come outnin your favor, you've got to act calm and professional. If younbreak down now there's no way they'll release her into yourncustody.\" Jacobnchoked back a sob and sat up straight, taking deep breaths to calmnhis nerves. Thendoor opened and Jane Faraday stood there, staring at them a momentnbefore motioning them to enter the room. \"Ah,nAgent Cizelski,\" the older judge greeted Jacob's boss with anhandshake before turning to him. \"And you must be Agent Resh.\"nThey shook hands. \"Yes,nSir,\" Jacob replied, feeling like a child to the man, even thoughnhis white hair and plaid button down shirt did make him seemnfriendly. Everyonenwas crammed into the tiny office sitting on folding chairs in ancircle. Two chairs were left, and Jacob gratefully sat down in onennext to Walter, unsure how well he would be able to stand up if thennews turned bad. He was afraid he was already a little light headednfrom his nerves. He clasped his hands together in his lap and refusednto let them go. \"So,nI suppose we should get started here,\" Jane said. \"For thenrecord, I want everyone here to know that Angela's real and fullnname is Angela Marie Bennett. The Resh which was added on has beenntaken off.\" She turned to look directly at Jacob, staring deep intonhis eyes. \"You're one very lucky man,\" she said, her voicenintimidating enough to make him nearly wilt under its power. \"CSIncleared you. And with all that rubble, I have not a clue how theynfigured out what really happened. But they say you're clear.\" Reliefnhit Jacob in the head like a twenty pound hammer and he struggled tonstay sitting upright, to look as if nothing was wrong. \"Thanknyou.\" \"Don'tnthank me. Thank the evidence. Because I wouldn't have been sonnice.\" Jacobnnodded and looked over at the judge and Dr. Vecchio who had yet tonspeak. Thenpsychologist spoke up first, \"Jacob, I don't know how you did it,nbut you managed to make a connection with Angela when my nurses, andnmyself, couldn't. You managed to get her to at least attempt to eatnwith silverware, when my staff couldn't. I know the last time younwere here things didn't end on a happy note. That's to benexpected. But you've always been there for her, and that's whatnshe needs, to know that someone will always be there for her, nonmatter what. \"Rightnnow, she's going through a rough time, after three years of beingntreated like an animal now she suddenly has to relearn humannbehavior. She will never be the same way you knew her years ago.nBecause of the way they treated her, she will always have a flight ornfight mentality. In her case, it will be more of a flight than anfight, but with enough patience and time she might regain enough ofnher old self to hold down a possible job. Maybe. There are nonguarantees about any of this. As you probably know already, even thensmallest of things could set her off. What you view as normal couldnhave her hiding in a corner.\" Jacobnnodded, remembering the chocolate pudding on Angela's nose, justnwhen he thought he'd gotten close to her. But he didn'tnunderstand why the doctor was going into such detail to himnspecifically and not to everyone in the room. \"It'snbeen awhile since you've last seen her and her stitches have comenout. She hasn't tried anything since that dinner, but that doesn'tnnecessarily mean anything. As I said, even the smallest of thingsncould set her off and have her trying to cut her wrists again. Younshould be careful to keep all sharp objects away from her as much asnpossible. And always keep an eye on her.\" \"Younlook confused,\" Judge Hollister commented. \"You've been clearednby the CSI. I personally looked over the evidence myself and couldnfind nothing to arrest you on. I looked over Dr. Vecchio's notesnhere, and found nothing that says she can't go home with you.\" Jacobnstared at the judge in shock. Surely they weren't granting hisnwish? Surely the judge hadn't just said she could go home with him?nThat she was being released into his custody? Jacob wasn't surenwhether he should be up out of his seat and jumping for joy or...ornwhat? He was still in shock, too surprised to move a muscle, letnalone get up and dance around the room. \"Angelanis being released into your custody under one condition,\" the judgensaid. \"A psychologist will visit you both once a week and reportnback to me. If it looks like anything wrong is happening, if she cutsnher wrists once, she'll be brought back here within a heartbeat andnyou will be denied visitation rights. Understood?\" Jacobncould only nod his head as thoughts raced through his mind. Angelanwas being released to him. He was being allowed to take her home andncare for her. No one would ever hurt her again, as long as he lived.nOf course, his apartment was too small for both of them. He hated thenthought of having to move her too many times. But he would take hernhome if he could, get her settled in for awhile and do some apartmentnhunting. They needed a place big enough for both of them, but alsonone where he could work from. A home office, a big home office wasnimportant. A place with lots of windows. No. No, he would have to getnAngela's opinion about the windows. Though he wanted a place thatnwas sunny, and happy, if she didn't want... \"Jacob?\"nDr. Vecchio brought Jacob back to the present. \"Angela's in hernroom and a nurse is waiting to let you in if you'd like to tell hernthe news.\" \"Yes,nyes I would,\" Jacob stumbled over his words as he stood up. Walterngrabbed his hand and gave it a quick squeeze before he was out thendoor and standing in front of Angela's room. He took a fast breathnand walked in to find Angela in her usual place. He stopped in thenmiddle of the room not wanting to intrude on her personal space afterntheir last encounter. \"Angel?\"nhe breathed, his heart racing. Shenlooked up from her lap with sad eyes. When she saw who it was, shenblinked but didn't take her eyes away from him. She was wary ofnhim, on her guard, and it made him sad. She shouldn't have to benthat way. Not around him. He was there to help her. To protect her. \"Angel,nI'm sorry. I didn't mean for that dinner to turn out that way. Injust forgot. That's all. And I'm sorry. It won't ever happennagain. I promise.\" Herngaze fell to the floor in front of her, letting her guard down. Jacobnwalked over to her and sat down in front of her, leaving two feetnbetween them. \"Inknow you might never forgive me for any mistakes I may make. Butnthat's ok. I respect that. I'm going to be doing the best I cannto help you get better from here on out.\" Shenlooked back up at him with questioning eyes. \"BothnDr. Vecchio and the judge assigned to the case have agreed to releasenyou into my custody.\" Henwaited, letting that sink into her mind to see what her reactionnwould be. Her face betrayed no emotions but then she spoke, \"I'mnsorry,\" she whispered. \"I'm learning. And everything is scary.\" \"No,nAngel. No. You have nothing to be sorry for. After what thatnsonofabitch did to you.\" Jacob felt the tears coming to his eyesnagain, and wanted nothing other than to hold her tight. But he wasnafraid to move any closer. He wanted everything to go smoothly. Thisnwas a big event. And nothing could go wrong. \"You'll remember thensun,\" he said through his tears. \"You'll remember life.\" âœ¢ Severalnnights later after Jacob had gotten into his makeshift bed on thencouch he lay back and thought about the past few days. They'd beenngiven a private jet on loan from the FBI to get them back home tonSeattle, Washington that much quicker. Angela had been silent thenentire way home. She'd been quiet a lot lately, in her own world.nBut he couldn't really blame her. This was a new situation for her.nHis apartment was a new place and he'd broken the news only a fewnhours ago that he would be looking for a bigger place and he wantednher help in the search. Henwas beginning to learn to read her body language as if she wasnspeaking to him. She'd nodded her agreement to the new place, butnshe hadn't been happy about it. Reallynthough, there was nothing he could do. He only had one bed here. Theynneeded a larger place. Once there, all the moving would be over andnshe could finally settle in for good and get comfortable. She couldnfinally have a place she could call home. Fornnow, he was just doing his best to get her used to sleeping in a bednagain. The morning before when he'd gotten up he'd found herncurled up in the corner with a blanket wrapped around her. He'dnfound the same thing again this morning, but he was sure with timenshe'd adjust. Time was what she needed. Jacobnyawned and closed his eyes as he slowly began to fall asleep, glad tonknow that she was finally safe. No one would ever touch her again. Thensound of something hard falling on the coffee table in front of thencouch he was sleeping on, broke Jacob out of his deep sleep.nStruggling to sit up, he wiped the sleep from his eyes and wasnsurprised to find Angela curling up beside him under the blanket. \"Angel?\" Onnthe table he saw what had woken him up and his heart stopped beating.nHe stared at the object, remembering Dr. Vecchio's words back atnthe Chicago Hospital for Mental Health, \" She...she...triednto cut herself. Several times. That's why we put her in here. Shenrepresents a danger to herself and to everyone else right now...Wenthought maybe it was just an accident that first time. But she did itnagain the next day. And the next. We moved her here, but she'sndetermined to get those bandages off. She wants out of this world,nand I'm doing all I can to keep her here as long as possible.\" Thennhe remembered the scene from the kitchen earlier that day when Angelanhad accidentally knocked a glass off the table. He saw it shatteringnin slow motion on the floor and remembered picking up the pieces,ntelling Angela that it was ok, that she wasn't in trouble fornanything. Thisnwas the closest she'd willingly gotten to him, and the closestnshe'd willingly been to sleeping in a bed. He had to give her that.nBut inside, his heart was trembling. What had she done? Looking backnat the glass he realized there was no blood on any of its sharpnedges. She hadn't done it. She hadn't cut herself. Henlooked down at her in his arms and found her as close to him as shencould get with her head buried in his chest. She'd willingly takennthe first big step towards getting over what the Praetorians had donento her. She'd given up the glass and come to him. Even if shenwasn't talking to him Jacob knew everything was going to be ok. Itnwould take a long time, but everything would be ok. Lettingnher get comfortable in his arms as she fell asleep he laid his headnback down on the pillow above hers and thanked the world forneverything he had right there.

And this is a newer edited version of the story that was already posted. It starts off just after Angela and Mariano are arrested by the FBI near the end of the episode \"Zero.\" The song \"Kentucky Rain\" by Elvis was the inspiration for this story. In past stories I always thought Praetorian HQ was in a bank, but it's not, it's in a travel agency, so that's fixed here. Sorry this took so long to finish! And don't forget to post a review! Even if you've read most of this before, a few things have changed. It says I updated this in January 2007 with chapter 12, and it wasn't finished then. But after finishing it, I went back and made some chapters longer, so as of May 2007 the story is complete and there are 12 chapters, they're just longer now. If you've already posted a comment, you can still post another one(just don't sign in and you can post as many as you want!) Thanks in advance, and thanks for past comments which kept me going! You guys are awesome! Chapter 1 Angela was led out of the Mattimoe Travel Agency in handcuffs along with Mariano and his gang after finally taking down the Praetorians and taking back her rightful identity. She looked around for some sign of Jacob. Perhaps he was in a police cruiser or perhaps he had gotten away. One look told her he wasn't in any of the cars on the scene which meant he must have gotten away. After she had put on the orange jumpsuit they gave her upon entering the prison, she was ushered down a long corridor of jail cells, all of them filled with women wearing the same jumpsuit. They took her to the last one and slid the barred door open. \"Here you go, Missy. You're lucky. You get a cell all to yourself\" the guard said before pushing her inside and sliding the barred door closed. Angela stood there, staring out into the hall, holding onto the bars, wondering where Jacob was. If he hadn't already been caught, arrested, and sent to prison, then for sure he must have escaped. This meant that he could get her out of jail and Mariano and his friends too! But how would he do it? Angela sighed and went to sit on the small cot in her cell. Who knew just how he would get her out of there? Jacob was resourceful, he would come up with something, he always had before anytime she had been in trouble. Her eyelids began to fall as she yawned. Breaking into Praetorian Headquarters had been a whole lot harder than she had thought. She was on the cot, with her knees drawn up to her chest and her arms wrapped around her legs, deep in thought, when her cell door was opened. She looked up to see another woman being ushered into her cell. She had dirty blond hair and bulked up arms. She squinted at Angela as if checking her over to make sure she was worthy enough to be sharing a cell with. \"You've got company, Missy. Be nice!\" the guard said as he closed the door. She could hear the sound of his boots ringing on the cold concrete floor, as he walked back down the hallway. \"What're you starin' at?\" the other woman asked. \"Nothing,\" Angela said with a sigh, resting her chin on her knees. \"Yeah, you better be starin' at nothin'!\" Where was Jacob when Angela needed him? Though that made her sound weak, like she couldn't even defend herself against another woman. \"Off the cot!\" \"What?\" Angela asked, startled out of her thoughts. \"You heard me! Get off the cot!!! It's mine now! You've had it all to yourself for too long now. Hurry up! Off the cot!\" Slowly, Angela got up. The woman pushed her away and sprawled out on the thin mattress as Angela went to sit in the farthest corner away from her. For awhile, neither spoke a word to the other. The woman stayed sprawled out on the cot while Angela curled up in her concrete corner. Where was Jacob? He should have gotten her out by now. He must have an elaborate plan or something. This was going to be even harder than breaking into Praetorian Headquarters. \"So, what're you in here for?\" the woman asked. Angela sighed, \"Nothing.\" \"Nothin'! God, you really are dumb!\" Angela only stared at the wall in front of her. \"Hey!\" They both looked up when they heard a voice from the hall. There was a guard standing there looking at Angela. \"Yeah! You! Come on! Someone's here to see you!\" Jacob! Angela quickly got to her feet and followed the guard. She was led down the hall to another room, where she met a man in his middle forties with dark hair. Not a young man, seventeen years of age with bleach blonde hair. \"Don't tell me, I know. Jacob sent you and you're supposed to be my lawyer, right?\" \"Umâ€¦â€¦I'm sorry, Ms. Bennett, but I don't know any Jacob,\" he said. Had she heard him right?! He didn't know who Jacob was, but even so, he had called her by her real name, not Marx, the name the Praetorians had given her. \"I know, he probably told you not to mention his name to protect himself, I understand. Forget I said anything.\" \"But, I don't know who he is. Honest. And I'm not here as your lawyer.\" What?! Thenâ€¦..where was Jacob? What had happened to him? Why wasn't he trying to get her out of here? Had the police gotten him too? Or had something else happened to him? \"My name is Walter Cizelski. I'm here on part of the CIC.\" \"CIC?\" \"Center For Intrusion Control\" \"Oh. What charges am I being brought up on? I have a right to know, you know.\" \"You're not being brought up on any chargesâ€¦.well, that is, if you accept my offer.\" \"What offer?\" Here's where Jacob comes in. He knows about him. This Walter guy wants me to give up Jacob, I just know it! \"I'm looking for agents to populate the CIC.\" \"What? What did you just say?\" \"I want you to go to Quantico , get some FBI training, and then work for me in the CIC.\" \"What? What exactly is the CIC anyway? And why? Why would you want me? I'm in jail, aren't I?\" \"We police the internet. I'm sure you know how much crime happens online, and no one's taken the initiative to police it yet. I want to do that. I know how good you are with computers. And I know you're innocent. So, if you take my offer, I'll get you out of jail. Mariano and his friends already walked earlier today.\" \"They did?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where's Jacob?\" \"I don't know. I told you that already.\" \"Jacob Resh? He was with me in all this, he helped me out. Are you sure the cops didn't get him too. Or did something else happen to him? He was there at the travel agency where I was arrested. He was breaking into the their computer system. He's got to be somewhere!\" \"I have no clue who you're talking about. No clue at all. Now, what about the offer? If you don't take it, you'll have to go to court and you'll probably end up with a life sentence in jail. If you take the offer, you leave jail right now, with nothing on your record. And you'll have a job.\" \"I'll take it.\" Maybe this way she could find Jacob. She knew he was out there somewhere. He was probably just hiding out somewhere until he felt safe enough to come out. But it was ok. Wherever he was, she was sure he was ok. He had to be. \"OK, well, I need to go talk to a few people about this, get it finalized. I'll see you later.\" A guard came in and walked Angela back to her cell after Walter left. When she was ushered into the cell, her cellmate didn't even look up at her. She was lying on the cot, her hands behind her head, and her eyes closed. Angela sat in the corner. She couldn't seem to get him off her mind. She knew there had to be a logical reason why Jacob hadn't contacted her. He could take care of himself. She knew this, but she still couldn't seem to get him off her mind. She couldn't seem to stop worrying about him. He was fine though, she know he was. He had to be. But then where was he? Maybe if she took this job she was just offered she'd be able to find him. Right, like he'd ever think to look for her there. He'd never find her in an FBI office! \"Hey!\" Angela looked up to see her cellmate looking at her. \"So, was he the one that's been on your mind this whole time?\" \"What? Who?\" \"The guy that was just here to see you?\" \"How do you know it was even a guy?\" \"Cause, I just know these things. So? Was he?\" \"No, someone else.\" \"Lawyer?\" \"Um, yeah.\" She didn't need to know about the job. She wouldn't know the difference. Whatever. Hey, how did she even know she had a guy on her mind? Well, they were not like that anyway. But she still couldn't get him out of her brain. \"So, then it must be your husband on your mind then?\" \"I'm not married.\" \"Ah sure you are. A guy that's on your mind twenty-four/seven. You're married. Whether by a priest or not, you're married if you think about him that much. I certainly hope he thinks about you just as much, otherwise it's a one sided marriage.\" \"I told you, we're not married.\" \"Yeah right. That's just what you WANT to think.\" Angela turned her head away as a single tear slowly made its way down her cheek. He had to be out there somewhere. He just had to be safe and OK. \"Hey! I was talking to you!\" Turning back, Angela quickly wiped the tear away. \"Were you crying?\" \"No.\" Two hours later, another guard came back for Angela. Quietly, without a word to the other woman, she walked out of the cell and down the hall with the guard. She was lead into a beige room with only a chair and a table inside. On the table were her clothes and a yellow envelope containing her personal things. She took off the orange jump suit and put on her old clothes and took her watch and wallet out of the envelope. She was then lead out to Walter who was waiting for her. \"Glad to be out of there?\" he asked. \"Yeah, I am.\" She gave a slight smile as they walked outside to his waiting rental car. If Jacob didn't go to her, she had to go to him, wherever that was. She couldn't leave him out there alone. \"Where are we going? You know I have no place to live, right?\" \"We're basing our operations out of Washington State. Your apartment is still there, still in your name. Past rent and all utilities have been paid by the government. We've got a plane to catch in two hours.\" Angela stared at him in awe. \"You would do that for me?\" she asked. \"The government did. Not me, personally. Besides, I know how good you are. You're exactly what we need.\" Stepping out of Walter's actual government issue grey Ford Angela felt odd to be back home. It had been almost a whole year since she'd seen her old apartment. She wasn't sure if she was elated at everything being over, or afraid of finding some long dead Praetorian inside. Looking from the apartment building to the street her eyes widened to see her old, rusted out, blue Jetta sitting at the curb. \"That's my car...\" \"And these, I do believe, are your keys,\" Walter said, handing her a set of keys. \"Here's my business card, call me in the morning and we'll discuss what's what, then, ok?\" \"Yeah sure. Hey, really, thanks for everything. I really appreciate it.\" \"No problem. Just don't forget to call me. Remember I hold the keys to your future. If you don't call I can have cops on your doorstep faster than you can blink.\" \"Don't worry, I won't forget.\" Entering the long abandoned apartment, she found the place to be in the same mess it had been in when she'd last seen it, running away from Sean Trewlawney, wherever he was now. She walked through the kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom, and found that nothing seemed to be missing though a lot was still broken and her plants were dead. Pulling her empty wallet out of her pocket, she sat down on the couch in the living room. She looked around her, at all of her things, thrown every which way, by the man who had chased her for over a year and had tried to kill her on a number of occasions. Remembering just how easily Sean had gotten to her, she didn't feel very safe there anymore. She opened her wallet to see how much money she had for a hotel room, and then remembered she had no money left to her name. But, just before she closed her wallet, she discovered that it wasn't as empty as she had thought. In shock, she pulled out a photograph. \"Jacob!\" she exclaimed out loud, covering her mouth with her hand. \"Oh my God! I never put this in hereâ€¦\" she whispered to herself. \"How did this get here?\" It was a photo of Jacob, she hadn't even known she'd had. She recognized the picture as his senior high school photo. He was wearing the traditional tux complete with his bleached hair. Handsome? Oh yes! And cute too! Holding the picture close, she suddenly remembered something, got up and went into her bedroom. Under the bed she found her old lock box, miraculously untouched. She unlocked it, and to her relief, found one hundred dollars in cash inside. Taking the money, her wallet, keys, and Jacob's picture, she set them all down on the coffee table. In the closet she rummaged around through everything that had been thrown around and misplaced. Finally, she came up with a picture frame as empty as her wallet. She put Jacob's picture in it and put it in a duffle bag with the rest of the stuff she had gathered up as well as some clothes, tooth brush, and a few other essential items lying around the house. Throwing the bag over her shoulder, she left the apartment and drove to the nearest motel. After booking a room for the night, she took out Jacob's picture and set it on the night stand. Everything else she left in the bag. Ever since the Praetorians had started chasing her, she'd always been prepared to run at a moment's notice. Forgetting to turn the lights out, she got into bed, and lay there, staring at Jacob's picture, unable to fall asleep. For so long, she'd been staying in hotel rooms, alone, and with Jacob. They seemed almost like home now and she wasn't sure she could ever get used to staying in the same place for too long, afraid of who might find her even though Jacob could be one of those people. She knew he could take care of himself. He'd proved it on a number of occasions. So why was she so worried about him? Why did she feel this way? No easy answer came to her that night.[Chapter 2] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 2 In the morning, Angela pulled out Walter's business card, and called his number from the hotel room. He gave her directions to a music store and told her to meet him there in half an hour. Angela quickly changed into some fresh clothes and paid for the room. She then threw her bag into her car and went to the nearest Dunkin' Donuts, buying one old fashioned donut and a small coffee, black, which was all she could afford. She finished the donut and half of her coffee on her way to meet her new boss, pulling up to the music store at the same time he was getting out of his own car. \"Nice timing!\" he said when he saw her. \"Thanks. So, what are we doing here at a music store? I thought we were FBI.\" \"Well, almost FBI for you. You still have to go through eight weeks worth of training.\" Walter opened the door and they went inside. Upon entering the store, Angela noticed that every classical CD that ever existed lined the walls. No other music could be seen, no pop, country, rock, or rap. \"OK, well, this is our office.\" \"What? A music store? Are you kidding?\" \"Nope. The store is just the front. Back here,\" Walter lead her to another room through a curtain. \"This is the official office.\" Several desks lined the back wall, each with a computer on it. But the computers had not been put together yet. Cords lay everywhere, monitors lay on shelves, separate from everything else, along with several printers. Boxes littered the floor along with bubble wrap and lots of plastic. \"I'm sorry,\" Walter apologized. \"I know nothing about putting these things together. I tried. Honest. It just wasn't working out.\" Angela sighed, a slight smile on her face. \"Well, be glad you hired me then.\" She grabbed a monitor from the shelf and set it down on a desk. Looking around the room she grabbed several cords and hooked them into the computer, linking the monitor to it, and plugging it in. \"Software?\" she asked. Walter handed her a bunch of CD-ROMs, and she inserted the first one into the computer after turning it on and waiting for it to boot up. While the programs installed, she grabbed more monitors, printers, cords, set them together on desks, and continued to hook things together. Walter could only stand there and watch her. \"OK, Walter, test run of this computer,\" Angela said, sitting in front of one they'd set up to be a locator, able to find the last place someone had been.[Chapter 3] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 3 Dear Jacob, I've been here two days, at Quantico that is. Skate and I are in the same shooting class together. It was interesting. Learning how to shoot, didn't think I'd ever have to do that. It was really boring too. Two hours of learning how to handle a gun and clean the thing. I guess next class we actually get to shoot targets or something, finally. As Skate said, this part's the easy part. It's the shooting that's hard. We'll see, I guess. All my other classes went ok too. Not much to talk about there, just learning the ways of the FBI: how to handle certain cases, and how to arrest someone, the many different laws and stuff like that. It's too bad I didn't go through all this before I met Trelawney. I could have had him cooking in jail a long time ago! Trust is a hard thing. Especially after the Praetorians. But you know that already. It's going to take me a long time to earn that back. I think I could get to trust Skate more than I currently do. He's ok. One of the better guys here, that's for sure. Drakes is a bully, untrustable to the core. But Skate's ok. He's really the only person I talk to here besides Walter. Walter, well, he says he knew I was innocent from the start. Figures he would have to since he hired me and got me into training. But I still would never be able to tell him everything. I couldn't. He doesn't believe me anyway. About you. But you, you're at the top of my list. I know I could trust you with my life. Lord knows I've had to many times. I can tell you everything. You know, I'm sorry. I have to apologize about that first night when you showed up. You turned out to be the best guy in my life. And I'm going to renew my search for you as soon as I get out of Quantico and back to the real world. I miss you Jacob. -Angel BANG![Chapter 4] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 4 Angela took Skate to the music store and showed him into the back room, full of computers. \"Wow! I can already tell this will be a fun job.\" \"Glad to hear it.\" Walter said, looking up from a screen in front of him covered in a coded message he was trying to decode. \"What's that?\" Angela looked over his shoulder. \"Someone put a virus in one of the Green Savings Bank's major computers and it keeps bringing up this code, but I can't figure out what it's supposed to mean.\" \"It's not supposed to mean anything Walter,\" Angela said. \"Trace the code.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"They're not professionals, whoever did this. Trace the code and you can figure out where the virus came from.\" \"Oh, right.\" They watched, as on the screen, a line began to bounce around between images of computers. The screen zoomed out for a moment, then zoomed back in and the line finally stopped. Walter pulled up the particulars of the computer. A few days later Angela was curled up on her bed writing in her journal when Skate came into the room. He was holding a carton of cookie dough ice cream in one hand and a spoon in the other.[Chapter 5] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 5 \"I figured it out,\" Walter said as soon as she'd walked in the next door. \"Erin Jack's been playing with us. He's been giving us clues to his location, wanting us to play his game. Angela, remember that last message he sent a few days ago? I think I finally cracked it. Listen to this...\" \"I quit,\" Angela said, cutting her boss off in mid-sentence. \"What?\" Walter looked up from his computer in surprise. Skate stood behind her and shrugged his shoulders. \"I tried to convince her not to, Walter. But I just couldn't. She's dead set on going.\" \"Going? Going where? What are you talking about?\" Angela sighed. \"I need to find Jacob. Not knowing where he is, is bothering me too much. It's ruining my work. I can't concentrate on anything. It's just best if I go out and search for him.\" \"But...but...What about the case? Erin Jack's the biggest case out there, if we can catch him...\" Walter struggled to understand everything and comprehend that she was leaving. \"I just wanted to come here and tell you myself. I'm sorry, Walter, but this is just something I have to do.\" Before she could change her mind, Angela had turned around and left the music store. Out on the road Angela drove for many hours, not even sure where she was going, before stopping at an internet cafÃ© for lunch. She hooked up the new laptop she'd bought a few days before and started up the new program CIC had gotten which she'd borrowed to aid in her search for Jacob. No one had yet had a chance to use the program at work, it was so new.[Chapter 6] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 6 Angela woke at the feel of a thick rope holding her wrists in place, holding her still. She blinked and looked around her, struggling to remember where she was. A cold breeze blew in from the open window nearby, raising goose bumps on her bare breasts. She looked down and found her body naked on the bed. \"You are so beautiful.\" She looked beside the bed and found the priest there, kneeling on the floor, no longer wearing his white collar, his head just inches from her own. She stared at him, and tried to get up, but her wrists were bound to the bed frame. Jacob lay in the stairwell for a few seconds, waiting for them to catch up to him and take him away to their new headquarters. Life was over. They would just keep chasing him down. Any little bit he succeeded in living after this would only end up being his running away while they chased him. There would be no relaxing on a sunny beach. Not even college and a good job was an option.[Chapter 7] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 7 The next morning after finding another cheep motel and attempting to get a good night's sleep she wandered into the small grocery store next door to find some cheep cold cereal for breakfast. Surveying the cereal she heard the sound of a plastic bag popping open and the concealed air being released from the next isle over. \"You can't eat that! You have to pay!\" one of the store clerks exclaimed. Standing on tip-toe Angela peered over the shelves to see a young brown haired teen reach into his pocket and pull out some loose change while still madly chowing down on the bread in his other hand. Just then, as the clerk was counting the change and frowning at the small amount, the front door opened and the trench-coated men walked in, their large weapons raised. The clerk froze and Jacob dashed away, with no place to go. Angela ripped her service gun out of it's holster by her hip and leaped out into the main isle, firing her gun at the men while she grabbed Jacob's arm and held on tight. The men were stunned, and stopped dead in their tracks for a second, just enough to let Angela and Jacob get away. She pulled him out of the store's back door and over to her motel room where she quickly locked and secured the door. Looking out the peep hole she watched the men leave the store and walk across the street into another store. They came out seconds later and headed down the street in the other direction. Turning to face Jacob who'd sat down on her unmade bed, Angela only stared at him, unsure what to say. \"Why didn't you call me or something?\" she finally asked. \"Like I knew your number or where you were living?\" \"You're a computer geek, just like me. Of course you could figure that out. Jacob, I could have been helping you!\" \"No. No. No. They wanted me all along. They were only using you to get to me. And when you finally had your life back, I didn't want to ruin that.\" \"Yeah, but I was picked up by the FBI.\" \"What?! You mean? Your name?\" \"I'm an agent now. So why wouldn't you want me on your side?\" \"Agent?\" \"Yup.\" Angela showed him her badge, and her weapon which was now safely back in her holster. \"I have a new name. Erin Jack.\" \"Wait...Erin Jack? That's the biggest case out there right now. Shit. This explains why your social never worked when I tried it. Damn, I wish I'd known. But what about the messages? The FBI's been getting cryptic messages from Erin.\" \"They're fake. Sent out by those Trenches. They want me to be caught so they can take me. Same as Trelawney always did before.\" Angela pulled the pack of cigarettes out of her pocket, and took one out of the box. \"Angel?\" Jacob looked at her with a confused look on his face as she lit the cigarette and stuffed it in her mouth. She sat down and stared at the floor, inhaling the nicotine. \"It's a recent habit,\" she said, finally looking up at him. \"I used to smoke sometimes in college. I quit cold turkey when I graduated. But since losing you, my life hasn't been the same. This whole thing has been crazy. It's been getting to my brain. My boss and co-worker think I'm going insane. Sometimes I think I am too. This helps me calm down.\" A worried look crossed his face. But he did not get up and take it from her. \"I'm OK, really,\" she said, seeing the look. \"But tell me about them. Who are those creepy guys?\" \"The Praetorians. I told you, they were using you the whole time to get to me. But they didn't know who I was at the time. And now they've figured it out and know who I am.\" \"Jacob, those were not the Praetorians. I saw them. They couldn't be.\" \"They are. The new Praetorians. Super high tech. It takes me days to get their locators off me. And with one of those, they don't have to keep a close watch on me. They just have to look at their computer screen and know were I am at all times.\" \"Damn.\" She looked back at Jacob and noticed for the first time the dark rings underneath his eyes, signaling his lack of sleep in a long time. \"You need sleep,\" she said. \"No. I can't. I shouldn't even be here talking to you. They'll find me easily. You're only next door to that store. I need to go.\" He was also thin, as if he hadn't eaten in a long time either, and the way he'd chowed down on the bread earlier, further proved this thought. \"You need to eat too. I'm not letting you go.\" She looked around the room for something to eat and found a box of cereal she hadn't even known she'd grabbed lying on the floor by the door. \"Look, I've got several clips left, we'll be fine here. But you need food and rest.\" \"And you need to stop smoking.\" She ignored that last comment and grabbed the box, handing it to Jacob, who tore it open and began to thrust handfuls of the fruity Os into his mouth and chew furiously. \"I'm sorry there's no milk,\" she said, staring at him, just glad to know that he was alive and safe. All she could do was stare at him, amazed to see him once again. Her mind flashed back to meeting Walter and then Skate at Quantico and she regretted that Jacob hadn't been there to share in those moments. Jacob hadn't said a word while he ate and when he was done he closed the box and threw it on the bed. \"I should go,\" he finally said. \"No. You need rest.\" \"Angel, they'll find me here. I don't want to bring you into this. And I have to stay one step ahead of them.\" \"Jacob, you brought me into this back when I got that message I wasn't supposed to see, before I met Sean Trelawney. You brought me into this, and I'm not getting out until we're both out. You have no idea what my life has been like without you, and I don't want to go through that again. Together we'll beat them. And this time we'll win. I promise. Now get some sleep. I'll keep watch. I didn't go to Quantico for nothing.\" Jacob sighed and moved back towards the pillows. A slight scream escaped his lips as he moved. \"What's wrong?\" Angela asked. \"Nothing. Nothing. Don't worry. I'm fine.\" But he wasn't fine, and it was obvious in the way he gritted his teeth as he moved to lay down. Angela hurried to his side and sat down. \"Tell me what's wrong.\" \"It's just the locators. I'll be fine.\" \"Explain these locators.\" He sighed. \"They shoot me with a laser when they think I'm going to get away and it hits me, clings to me, and to get it off I have to erase the codes so they can't be used anymore.\" \"Where do they hit you?\" \"Usually my back. Since I'm running away.\" \"Roll over. Let me see.\" \"No, Angel, please.\" \"Roll over.\" Jacob reluctantly did as he was told and Angela moved his shirt to see his back. In his lower back she found something metal that had clamped down hard into his skin. A small bit of dried blood surrounded it. There was another one near his right shoulder blade. But while this one had no dried blood his skin was blue and puffy around it. \"Oh my God. Jacob, you need to get these taken care of. Get them out of you.\" \"I can't. What doctor would be able to? What doctor in his right mind would look at those, and without questions, say 'yeah, sure, I can get those out for you' like I had rotted teeth or something. Besides, it would come up on the radar screen. The Praetorians would know about it and know where I am and it would be a big mess.\" \"I know a doctor who used to play online chess with my best friend. I'm sure he would help. Without questions.\" \"Steven Graff, of course.\" \"Get some sleep. In eight hours I'll wake you and we can get out of here. I think I might have just enough money to rent a car and get us out to Chicago.\" Angela pulled the covers up over him and taking the cereal box she went back to the chair she'd been sitting in earlier. She watched Jacob close his eyes and slowly fall asleep as she took her gun and laid it out on the desk to be ready in case of an emergency. Her one bag was already packed and ready for her to leave in a hurry. She began to eat the rest of the cereal, careful not to wake Jacob with loud movements. Seven hours later Jacob shot out of bed, his eyes wide. \"They're coming!\" he exclaimed, getting out of bed as fast as possible while gritting his teeth from the pain in his back. Angela jumped to her feet, dropping the empty cereal box to the floor, grabbing her weapon and her bag. Running out the door Jacob looked up the street to their right and saw the trench coated men coming their way. He pushed Angela to the left. \"MOVE!\" he roared and together they ran down the street and onto a side street, where they turned down another street and ran like hell. \"Ang! Jump in!\" Angela stopped at a familiar voice calling her name. \"Angel, move!\" Jacob urged her on but she hung back and turned to see her old car in the next street over. In the driver's seat was Skate with the window rolled down waving her over. She pulled Jacob's arm and ran towards the car. She opened the back door and pushed him inside and slid in beside him. \"Angel, what are we doing?\" Jacob asked in confusion. \"Skate, drive! Get us out of here! We need to get to Chicago. I hope you know the way!\" Skate stepped on the gas peddle and the car sped forward. \"No, I don't really. But I'm sure we can stop and ask for directions.\" \"No. We've got Praetorians on our heels. Advanced Praetorians.\" \"I thought they were gone!\" \"They're not. Now drive!\" \"Who's he?\" Jacob finally asked. \"And how does he know about the Praetorians?\" \"His name's Skate. Skate, this is Jacob. I met Skate at Quantico and he now works with me.\" Jacob gave her a look that clearly asked whether or not she trusted him and she nodded. \"You never did tell me what you do within the FBI,\" he said. \"We help police the internet.\" Jacob snorted. \"Good one. Good one. Not with these jokers still alive you can't.\" Angela nodded again. \"I know.\" \"What's in Chicago? If you don't mind my asking,\" Skate asked. \"Does Walter know you're out here?\" \"Walter?\" \"Boss.\" Jacob nodded. \"You asked me a question back at Quantico, about what I would do if someone shot you? Remember that?\" \"Of course.\" \"I stand by that answer I gave you. When your car was done in the garage and they called me to pick it up, I just packed up and left. Told Walter I needed to take a week off from work after he dropped me off to pick up your car. And that was that.\" Jacob looked surprised, and almost scared to know that there was another man in her life who had already devoted himself to her while he'd been gone. \"So, what's in Chicago?\" Skate asked again. \"A doctor. We need to get him to a doctor. ASAP.\" \"I'll have to get gas soon.\" \"Just get us as far away from here as you can before we make any stops.\" Angela sighed. \"We'll also need to get some food.\" \"Got that covered. There's a cooler in the trunk with all my stuff.\" \"You're awesome Skate.\" \"Thanks.\" Angela turned to Jacob to see the dark circles under his eyes had not moved since she'd last seen them. \"It's going to be a long ride. You should lay down and get some rest.\" Jacob only looked at her and then behind them, out the back window. \"Don't worry, you're safe. I'll take care of you, make sure nothing happens to you.\" She watched as his eyes drooped closed for a few seconds before his eyelids popped back open. She reached out and took him into her arms, pulling him towards her so that his head was resting in her lap. He closed his eyes at her bidding and was soon asleep. \"Ang, do you know how far it is to Chicago from here? I know we're almost over the boarder and out of Washington, but do you know?\" Skate asked. \"I know it's far. But there's a doctor there that can help him.\" \"What's wrong. Why can't he see a doctor here? I'm sure we've got someone in Washington State that can...\" \"No. You don't understand. They've done something to him. I can't explain it. But this doctor will help him. He helped me once when I was shot. He used to play Chess online with Jacob, and...just get us there, OK?\" \"OK, but how serious is this?\" \"I don't know. I don't know fully what they did to him.\" \"I think you'd better get plane tickets.\" \"I can't risk it. I don't have names. They know me. If I buy tickets and they find out I'm with him, it'll all be over. They'll get me too. Change me back to Liz Marx and then I can't help him.\" \"Ang, you're forgetting something. We're FBI. We can make aliases. Easy as pie. When we stop for the night I'll make us some. And then we can get plane tickets and get him there faster.\" There was a long pause and then, \"I can see it in your eyes.\" \"What?\" Angela had been watching Jacob sleep, still glad to see him again, glad to know he was still alive and in her arms. She just wanted to hold him tight to never let him go, but she was afraid of hurting him with the trackers still in his back. And she didn't want to wake him up. She looked up at Skate who briefly looked back at her. \"I can tell how much you care about him. The way you're watching him, and caring for him. Most people wouldn't go to all this trouble for someone unrelated to them.\" \"You're going through all this trouble too, Skate.\" \"No. It's not the same. You're more emotionally attached than I am. To him. It's something I can't explain.\" Angela nodded silently, having gone back to watching Jacob while he slept. \"We are related,\" she said after awhile. \"Sean Trelawney did that to us. The Praetorians. Both our fathers worked for them once, and died under their hands. They brought us together. And there's nothing that can change what happened or pull us apart. It's just a fact of our lives now.\"[Chapter 8] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 8 Stopping at a cheap motel the next night Angela sat beside Jacob while Skate was in the shower. In her hand she clutched the journal she'd been writing in ever since she's entered the front gate at Quantico many months before. \"Jacob, losing you ruined my life. I vowed to find you again, no matter what it took, or how long. Even if you had gone back to New York and never wanted to see me again, for whatever reason. Now that I've found you, I'm not letting you out of my sight until this is all over and you decide to leave. With that being said, this belongs to you.\" Angela handed him her journal. \"What's this?\" he asked. \"Everything I wanted to tell you since getting out of jail after taking down Trelawney. You don't have to read it if you don't want to. But I addressed it to you, so it's only fair that you have it.\" Jacob's eyes grew wide at her words and almost seemed to be smiling but he was speechless, unable to say a word. \"When I say I missed you, Jacob, I really mean that.\" Skate came out of the bathroom wearing an old t-shirt and his boxers, intent on getting some shut-eye. \"I'm gonna take a quick shower, and then I'll stay up and keep watch,\" Angela said, heading to the bathroom and leaving Jacob to mull over everything she'd just told him. \"You said they were gone,\" Skate said, looking over at Angela in the front passenger seat while he drove. Jacob was asleep in the back seat, using Angela's fleece jacket as a pillow, and his own as a blanket. \"Ang, you told me you'd defeated them. So how did they come back? I thought they were dead?\"[Chapter 9] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 9 Angela caught Jacob as he fell and carefully lowered him to the ground. \"Jacob? Jacob speak to me! What's going on?\" \"Angel, Angel...I hurt...\" Angela looked up, desperately searching for Skate when a rental car came speeding over to them and screeched to a halt a few feet away. Skate jumped out of the driver's seat. \"What happened?\" \"I don't know!\" Skate opened the back door as Angela picked Jacob up into her arms and got him into the back seat of the car. She got in beside him and held him close as Skate sped away and followed her directions to the hospital. Fifteen minutes later Skate pulled up in the Emergency Room parking lot and opened the door for Angela as she struggled to get Jacob out of the back seat. He was heavy, and still in pain as he moaned from her touch.[Chapter 10] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 10 Angela pulled Skate with her as she ran away from the hospital building and the jumping Trenches. Behind an ambulance, they hid from the Trenches view. She let go of his arm and checked to make sure all of her clips were in place. So far she hadn't fired a shot, but she wasn't going to go down with a full clip left in her gun. No way. She looked over at Skate who was breathing heavily. \"You OK?\" \"Yeah, fine.\" Angela poked her head out to see the Praetorian Trenches coming towards them with a measured walk, as if they were in slow motion. Seeing her, one aimed his gun, but she was quicker, squeezing off a few rounds into the man's stomach. She watched him double over for a second before standing back upright and firing off a round. Angela hid behind the ambulance to avoid the shot, but the weapon he had was more than just a gun. The round hit the ambulance and she felt the vehicle rock with the force and then the explosion a second later. She covered her head and neck to avoid getting hit by flying debris before making a mad dash for cover further away. \"Shit, what was that?\" Skate asked, when they'd found a new ambulance. \"I don't know. But I shot him, Skate. I know I did!\" She looked back to see all five Trenches still walking towards them in the same measured pace they'd been using all along. She returned to Skate. \"This is it. I'm going out there. I'm going to blast their heads off. And hope it doesn't come to hand to hand combat. If it does, then it does.\" Angela looked back to get a bearing on the Praetorians before dashing out there. \"Oh shit!\" \"What?\" \"Our boss is here! He's coming this way!\" \"Boss? Our boss? You mean Walter? Walter Cizelski?\" Skate asked in near confusion. \"Hi guys.\" Walter came around the ambulance and crouched with his two agents. \"Mind telling me what's going on here? Who are those guys?\" \"Long story. Can't really explain it,\" Angela said in a hurry to get back out there and kill the Trenches. Skate piped up and spoke quickly, \"basically, these are the remnants of the guys who changed her identity, and changed Jacob's. We found them going after Jacob, saved his life, he's in ER going through surgery, and now we're after these guys, looking to do them in. And, I think having another hand in this would help a great deal. These guys are nasty.\" \"I'm going out!\" Angela called, and made a mad dash around the ambulance and into plain sight of the Trenches. She began firing her gun into another of the trench-coated men, unsure which one she'd hit previously because they all looked the same and none of them seemed to carry wounds at all. She emptied her gun into the trench and he went down, falling to his knees. Reaching into her pocket she took another clip out, let the old one go, and slid the new one in, as another trench aimed his gun towards her and prepared to fire. She ducked and rolled, avoiding the missile like projection by a few inches. She came up in time to see the Trench she'd downed, get back up again. He had no wounds or injuries at all. This was going to be harder than she'd imagined. None of them had picked up their pace, they were so sure of themselves killing her and Jacob. Even as she ran, their pace never picked up, their long legs eating up the parking lot as they walked. Bullets sounded from behind her, but not those of the Trenches. As Angela turned back for a brief second, she saw Skate and Walter coming out from either side of the ambulance firing every bullet they had together. She whipped back around, and while they had gotten the attention of the Trenches she dashed back towards them, hoping to somehow get one of their own weapons to kill them with. Obviously, her own standard issue FBI piece wasn't going to amount to a hill of beans in this mess. She ran as hard as she could, and jumped onto the back of the last trench, and began to unclip the extra weapon strapped to his back. The Trench dropped the gun in his hands and reached over his head to grab her and pull her forward. Briefly she saw Walter motion Skate towards the fallen weapon as he kept their attention in the other direction. Angela was launched forward, the Trench having a tight grip on her shoulders. Once she was over his head, he flipped her over and wrapped his arms around her stomach. Walter was engaging the other four Trenches, to keep them busy, while Skate had picked up the dropped weapon and heaved it onto his shoulders. \"Shoot him Skate!\" Angela shouted. He looked worried, trying to aim the large weapon that almost looked too big for him. But the Trench was holding Angela in front of him as a shield. If Skate missed the trench and killed Angela, the Trench's job would have been done easily, and he'd only have three more people to kill. \"Aim for his head! Do it!\" she screamed, struggling in the Trench's arms to lower his head so that she would be slightly shielded herself and his head would be a better target. \"You can do it, Skate! Just shoot!\" The Trench held on tight, and refused to let her go, no matter how much she struggled. His muscles bulged in his arms and she wondered what would happen if she happened to bite him. But viewing what these guys were like, she doubted much would happen. He probably wouldn't even feel it. Skate was still trying to aim the giant weapon on his shoulders, and she could see his hands shaking. \"Remember training, Skate. You're my last chance! I know you can do it!\" Skate looked up at her, a sudden calmness in his features. He looked at the Trench's head above hers and a fierceness came into his eyes. He pulled the trigger on the weapon, and the missile-like projection shot out towards Angela and the Trench. She pitched her body forward with all of her strength as the missile hit it's target and the Trench went down, roaring like an injured lion on the African plains. He let go of Angela and she hit the ground rolling. Getting up she watched as the Trench stared at her, confused for a second, as a small metal spider clamped into his face and sunk into his skin. Two seconds later his head blew up. His body began to shake, and then was still before he collapsed. \"Nice job Skate!\" Angela high-fived him before spinning around to see how Walter was faring. Skate pulled the trigger on his weapon as he aimed it at another Trench but it wouldn't shoot. He pulled it again, and again it wouldn't shoot. \"I'll keep them busy. You figure that out!\" Angela called, running towards Walter, who was slowly backing away from the four other Trenches as they advanced on him, in their calculated movements. Upon seeing Angela approaching, one of them broke off from the group and began advancing on her. \"Oh shit,\" she said under her breath, as she began backing up. Looking back, while keeping the corner of her eye trained on the Trench she carefully avoided Skate, and headed towards the building, intent on circling it in hopes of finding some way to take him out. The only way so far seemed to be his own weapon, but she didn't have one, and couldn't get one that easily. This was going to be tricky. The Trench kept advancing on her, though he didn't aim his weapon and shoot her while he had the opportunity. None of them had. The only time they'd used their weapons, she realized, was to blast the ambulance away. To better see their quarry. And it began to make a little sense. These guys didn't want things simple, quick, and easy. If they had, Jacob would have been shot to death a long time ago and she'd be searching for him for the rest of her life. This guy wanted to trap her, and somehow make her life miserable. Though what he would do to her, and the others to Walter and Skate, she didn't know. But she thought it would be worse now that she had managed to get Jacob into the hospital and Skate had killed one of their own. Angela backed up into a wall, and realized that what she'd been thinking about had come true. The Trench had her trapped. He smiled an evil smile, as she turned to see that she had indeed backed right up to the outer wall of the hospital. But luck was on her side after all. There was a door not three feet away! She inched her way towards the opening, and slid through the small crack in the door she created. She dashed down the hall a short ways until she heard the door opening behind her. The Trench was coming inside. Angela began backing up again, in order to keep an eye on the Trench at the same time. \"What the...\" \"You can't be in here with him! Get him out of here!\" Nurses, and doctors screamed in alarm, and ran in every direction, as Angela continued down the hall, backward, her gun trained on the trench, knowing it would do know good. But also knowing it was her only hope. Her only chance. \"Clear the hall!\" Angela shouted to anyone who happened to be behind her. \"Clear the hall! Coming through!\" There were more frightened screams, as people ran, and carts and wheelchairs were moved out of the way, by hands reaching from doorways. Angela turned a corner and kept going, kept shouting. Though by now all the hallways seemed to have emptied of people and anything else that might have been in her way. The trench, calmly walked with Angela, following her every move, but still refusing to aim his weapon or attack her in any other manner. It seemed as if he was waiting for her to crumble in front of him. The way he kept following her, with such steadiness, and never backed down, with the size of his body and his weapons, he expected her to fall before him, afraid of him, before he came down on her. But she wasn't about to crumble in front of him. When it came to Jacob's life she would do anything to keep him alive. And she wasn't afraid of anything. Least of all a large bald man dressed in a long trench coat carrying a huge weapon. Or several of these men. Especially when they refused to use their weapons. This was only giving her a chance to kill him. She just had to find that chance. The hospital had become silent since she'd entered with the Trench and she could easily hear heart monitors beeping, and a few whispers from darkened rooms as she passed by. \"Tweezers, please,\" she heard a familiar male voice say, and she knew where she was. Looking to her left, she walked past the only room that had lights on inside. Dr. Steven Graff looked up to see her go by with her gun drawn, still trained on the Trench. Without a single hesitation he went back to the complicated surgery he was performing. \"Hang in there, Jacob,\" she whispered to the unconscious figure on the operating table. \"Just hang in there.\" Her eyes back on the Praetorian following her, she continued to lead him through the hospital, not knowing where she was going. He held his weapon across his chest and it never moved once. The man didn't even seem to be breathing at all. Only his legs and feet moved. The rest of him seemed to be one solid unmoving mass. Except for his eyes. No matter which way she went, his eyes always followed her and his feet led him to her, one step at a time. A bright light suddenly filled the hallway as she made a right hand turn. Glancing behind her Angela saw two double glass doors. She swung her head back around to watch the Trench as she backed toward the doors. Together they swung outwards, as she approached, and a few seconds later she was back outside, relieved that nothing had happened inside with so many innocent people. And with Jacob. \"Ang! Look out!\" Skate's voice caught her attention just as something caught her left foot. She stumbled over something and fell backwards. Bullets rang out into the air, taking the Trench's attention away from Angela. When she looked up she saw Skate firing his gun in the general direction of the Trench who'd been following her. Then she looked to see what she'd tripped over and saw one of the Trenches own weapons. Her chance had arrived. Without a moment to loose she swiped it off the ground, surprised at it's heaviness, and swung it up onto her shoulder, her knees almost buckling at the heavy weight. The missile-like projection fired off not even a second after she'd pulled the trigger and she watched as the Trench went down on his knees. A metal spider clamped onto his chest before digging it's claw-like legs into his skin. Moments later, his face a picture of confusion and agony, the Praetorian Trench let out a lion's howl before falling to his death. \"Nice job Angela,\" Walter congratulated her. She let the weapon fall to the ground with a loud thump before she saw Walter and Skate coming over to her. Two other Trenches lay sprawled on the pavement. And the others didn't seem to be anywhere nearby, whether they were alive or not. \"What happened to the other two?\" she asked. \"Don't know,\" Skate said. \"They disappeared while we were dealing with the other one. Managed to kill him, though it took some dealing.\" \"So, why'd they leave? That doesn't make sense?\" \"I can't answer that either,\" Walter said. \"I'm guessing they went to get more reinforcements when they realized how tough we are. Either that, or they went to tell their boss that we were beating their butts pretty good.\" \"Their boss is dead. They're not telling Mr. White what went down just now,\" Angela pointed out. \"And they don't need reinforcements,\" Walter said. \"Not with the strength these guys have.\" \"Well, we did kick their butts. But still...\" Angela heaved a heavy sigh before leaning against one of the white pillars holding up the portico. Fishing around in her pocket she came out with a cigarette and her lighter. Walter looked at her in surprise. \"Since when do you smoke?\" he asked. \"Long story.\" \"Yeah, everything with you is a long story.\"[Chapter 11] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 11 \"I'm sorry Walter,\" Angela said, looking into the eyes of her suspicious boss, while still being well aware of the Trenches bodies around them in a public place. \"So, why don't you tell us what you're doing here. How'd you find us? And why?\" \"My boss, Jane Faraday, whom you haven't met yet, called to tell me that my two agents apparently had Erin Jack in custody and were on a plane headed for Chicago. See, you didn't turn in your badge and weapon when you quit, so technically you're still FBI. She wanted to know why you were going to Chicago. I happened to be nearby working on a case, which I'm glad I was, since you didn't answer your cell phones when I called. So, I tracked you down. And here I am. Now, I've told my half of the story. You need to tell yours. What happened to Erin Jack, and who are these guys?\" \"Walter, it's a long story,\" Angela began. He gave her a angered look. \"I'm just warning you, Walter. You know about the Praetorians, who went after me. Who changed my identity, my life. It was all a front. Because I'd gotten an email I wasn't supposed to see, they thought I had ties with Sorcerer, and were using me to get to him. All they wanted was Sorcerer. But in the process I found out about their dealings so they couldn't leave me alone. Sorcerer, Jacob, thought that once they were on to me, he could help me get rid of them and they would never find out about him. Well, near the end, they did. They learned that Jacob Resh and Sorcerer were one in the same. Just before we took them down. However, they had a contingency plan, in case something should happen to them. They created the Trenches here, how I don't know. Who they really are, I don't know either. But these guys were sent out to get rid of every last person who knew anything about the Praetorians. Basically, if they died before they caught Sorcerer, there was no way he was going to escape their grasp. And so these Trenches followed him, put trackers in him. And he ran from them all this time. Until I found him. And we've been running from them ever since.\" \"So, why here? Why did you come all the way to Chicago?\" \"Because there's a doctor here who used to play chess with Sorcerer online. And once, when I was shot, he told me to come here, that the doctor would help me, without going to the police. What these Trenches did to Jacob, was so...so...no other doctor would have done anything to save him. I knew we had to bring him here.\" \"And Erin Jack? Where's he in all of this?\" \"Just before we stormed the Praetorian's headquarters when I got my own identity back, they figured out who Sorcerer was. And they changed his name. To Erin Jack. He's innocent Walter. He hasn't done anything that they've said he has. Those messages were fakes from the Trenches. They were hoping we'd catch him and turn him over to them. The same thing Trelawney tried with me.\" The look on Walter's face was skeptical. \"I know it's hard to believe. But it's true!\" Angela put out the small stub left of her cigarette just as several state police cars sped into the parking lot and came to a screeching halt. \"Walter, we need to keep this under wraps. I don't want the wrong people to see these Trenches, or their weapons. In fact, I want a look at one of those guns. I want to learn how it works, how it ticks. We still have two more of them to go after.\" Walter nodded as he turned to the policemen. \"Skate, I need you to do me a huge favor.\" \"Anything.\" \"I need to go look at those guns, figure them out. But I don't want to leave Jacob either. Will you stay here, and keep an eye on him? My cell phone's on. Call me if anything happens. OK?\" \"Yeah, sure.\" Angela watched Skate turn and enter the hospital before joining Walter with the state police. \"We've got a few weapons experts on staff, sure,\" one of them was saying. \"Great, I need to meet them, take a look at these guns,\" Angela said. \"You go with them, I'll wait for the coroner,\" Walter suggested. \"Where's Tim?\" \"He's waiting for news on Jacob. Told him to call me if anything happens.\" Walter made a face that clearly said he didn't want Skate waiting around, and that Jacob would be just fine without him, but he went with it just the same. \"Thanks Walter,\" she said, picking up a gun and throwing it over her shoulder as she approached the rental car and prepared to follow one of the police cruisers to the station. A few hours later, after having received no phone calls from Skate, Angela left the police station and headed back to the hospital.[Chapter 12] The Net: Still Running: Chapter 12 On the way to the airport Angela met up with the two weapons experts who handed her a belt with two holsters. They both contained brand new weaponry and she pulled one gun out to survey their work before sliding it back into it's holster with a grin, and strapping it on. Landing at the small airport in New York, Angela kept a tight grip on Jacob as she helped him slowly descend the stairs. Once at the bottom, she told the pilot to be ready to go in five hours. He nodded and climbed back into the plane to taxi off the runway, while Angela and Jacob waited for their car to pick them up. While they waited something else came for them instead. Two large men approached, wearing long concealing trench coats, carrying big weapons across their chests. \"Angel...I can't run...I can't...\" \"I've got them, don't worry,\" Angela said, a seriousness coming over her that he'd never seen before. Gently, she let him fall to the ground, to make him a smaller target before standing up right, ready to face the last two Praetorians head on. Together they walked toward her in their same steady stride, but she refused to move. And they came closer, and closer, slowly closer with every step. She could feel Jacob behind her on the ground, could feel his love for her emanating from him, and the strength building up within her own body, the strength to protect him at all costs. The Trenches stopped only a few yards away, and aimed their large weapons at Angela, knowing she was protecting their quarry. Without another thought, she dropped to the ground, avoided being shot by a tracker, and rolled, coming up with both sleek new guns drawn and aimed at her targets. Within seconds she'd pulled both triggers, and watched as missile-like projections shot out and hit both Trenches. Metal spiders clung to them, their claw-like legs digging into both men's skin. They went down, like a knife cutting through butter. \"Nice work!\" Jacob exclaimed just as their car finally arrived. \"I didn't know you were that talented with weapons.\" She reholstered the guns and helped Jacob back onto his feet. \"It's all in the training.\" \"Um, what happened here?\" The driver asked, surveying the two dead Praetorians. \"Long story, I can't explain it,\" Angela said. \"You must be Angent Mackey, I presume?\" \"Ah, yes. And you're Agent Bennett? Is that,\" he looked at Jacob. \"Is that really Erin Jack? You caught Erin Jack?!\" \"No. This is not Erin Jack,\" she said. \"Now look, I need you to do me a favor. We can find our way around the city no problem. What I need you to do is call FBI headquarters and get the coroner out here. Have him call my boss Walter, head of CIC, and he'll get the facts from him, about what to do with the bodies. OK? You just stay here with them, make sure nothing happens to them. Got that?\" \"Yeah, yeah sure.\" \"Good.\" \"We're going to need a hotel room,\" Angela commented in the car on the way to FBI headquarters in New York City. \"Why?\" \"Because that agent recognized you as Erin Jack, wanted criminal.\" \"Yeah, well, I find it amazing he recognized me, but not Liz Marx.\" \"Jacob. I'm only thinking of your safety. Besides, you won't be allowed inside Evidence Lockup anyway because you're not an agent.\" He sighed. \"Oh, fine.\" \"You know, it was bad enough when I was Liz Marx, and you were only Sorcerer. I had to do all this on my own, creating new identities along the way. You're one lucky man, to have me on your team, cause I am FBI. This stuff comes easily now. Besides, I still have that cd you gave me ages and ages and ages ago. Don't you worry, I'll have you a new identity in no time!\" Jacob smiled. \"You know, I always knew you were going places.\" Showing the agent on duty her ID, Angela was buzzed into Evidence Lockup, where she began searching for Sean Trelawney's computer from Praetorian Headquarters. Luckily, it was about the only thing there that hadn't been blown to bits. Searching the dates on each of the evidence boxes, she finally found the one she was looking for. Several boxes were marked with the case number and the date. She pulled them all down and opened each one on a nearby table, reading the tags attached to everything within each box. \"Computer located in private office\" read the tag she was looking for and she lifted the heavy computer out of the box and began to set it up. She slipped Jacob's cd into the drive and waited for the proper screen to pop up. She'd already put a virus on the computer when she had altered her own identity, and now it was still working in her favor. \"Sean, you are the butter,\" Angela said to the computer. \"And I am the knife.\" She pulled up Erin Jack's records and inserted the name Jacob Gabriel Resh, along with the rest of his important information. Hitting the enter key, she changed Jacob's identity back to his own. But before she put the computer away, she pulled up another file, and entered in some new code while taking out some of the original. Now, both her file and Jacob's was permanent. No one could tamper with either one and change their identities ever again. Satisfied, she unhooked the computer and put it back in it's box before heading back to the hotel, where Jacob waited for her, probably bored out of his mind watching tv. \"I've got good news!\" Angela exclaimed, opening the hotel room door. No one greeted her exclamation. The tv was off and there was no other sound within the room. Angela opened the door further and walked in, wild thoughts flying through her mind of kidnappers, other creepy men the Praetorians might have hired should the Trenches fail. But Jacob was there after all, sleeping soundly. Angela's heart melted as she lay down beside Jacob and watched him sleep, letting him get the rest he needed. On the night stand was the journal she'd used to write to Jacob. So he'd had the chance to read it. She'd written a lot of personal things in it. But nothing she didn't want him to know. He needed to know those things. Angela wrapped an arm around him gently as he slept. She had him back. And on top of that, he wasn't going to leave her ever again, either by force or by his own choice. \"I'm here with you, Angel. And I always will be. Don't you ever forget that.\" There wasn't a chance in hell she'd ever forget him saying that. Or his words after that: \"I love you too.\" Who knew she would have fallen for a handsome guy nine years younger than her? Age didn't matter though. Nothing else mattered except that he was with her and he was ok. She didn't have to worry anymore. And if they did end up growing old together, when she became an old wrinkled prune, she could smile and laugh at all the other old wrinkled prunes who had equally wrinkled prunes for husbands while hers was still young and handsome. The thought alone made her smile as she curled up closer to Jacob and waited for him to wake up. He'd pretty much said he was hers, after all. Jacob's beautiful blue eyes blinked open. \"Hey, you didn't wake me?\" he asked groggily. \"It's been a long day and you needed your rest.\" \"How'd it go?\" \"You're a free man, Jacob Gabriel Resh,\" Angela said with a smile. \"Ah, thank you!\" \"You know what this means?\" \"It's over.\" \"It's over. The Praetorians are gone. Every last one of them. And we both have our correct identities. I feel like we should be celebrating somehow, but nothing seems appropriate.\" \"I already am celebrating. Just by being here with you, and knowing it's all over. You know, I'll be celebrating for the rest of my life. Every time I take a plane somewhere, every time I go out in public and don't have to hide myself anymore.\" \"That's a great feeling. I think I might finally get to enjoy it myself.\" With his back still numb from the painkillers, Jacob carefully rolled onto his side so that he could face her better. \"I read your journal.\" \"And?\" Angela tried not to look too scared. After all, everything she'd written was meant for Jacob to read. Everything. But she was still a little squeamish at the thought of what his opinions would be. \"It means a lot to me that you did that,\" he said. \"I wish I could have been there. I missed your graduation. And I wasn't there to hold you together when everything fell apart. I wasn't there to kick that priest's ass either, but you did, so that's ok. By the way...you go girl! You kicked some guys ass, and that rocks!\" Angela grinned. \"Glad you think so.\" \"And you being an FBI agent is cool. Ultra cool. I still can't believe it. I hope you thanked Sean for that one, because if it wasn't for the Praetorians, you wouldn't have this awesome job.\" \"I did thank Sean. I thanked him for bringing you and me together. I wouldn't want to be running away from trouble with anyone else in this world.\" \"Awww thanks, hun.\" \"So, what now? What are your plans?\" \"My plans?\" \"You haven't finished high school yet. And what about college?\" \"I've got half a school year left to finish. If I finish that I can apply to Washington State University. That's near you.\" \"Are you sure you want to do that?\" Jacob looked deep into her eyes before responding. \"Yes, I'm sure.\" Angela smiled. \"You know, all those months running from the Trenches without you, I thought I was going insane. I got used to waking up with you, having someone there beside me fighting the bad guys. Not having you with me...I tried to forget you,\" he whispered as a single tear rolled down his cheek to soak the pillow beneath his head. \"Tried to go on. You had your life back and I didn't want to get in the way of that. I'd already ruined it once. But I missed you too much.\" Angela rested her hand against his face and wiped his tears away with her thumb. \"You didn't ruin my life Jacob. You made it that much better. And I couldn't be any happier right now.\" He smiled through his tears just as Angela's cell phone went off. \"Damn, it's probably Walter,\" she said, picking it up. \"Hello? Yes...oh, right...we're on our way, sorry.\" Jacob dried his eyes while she talked. When she hung up he looked at her quizzically. \"Pilot. We're late.\" \"And I was comfortable too,\" he complained, when she pulled him off the bed, laughing. As Angela opened the door Jacob took her hand in his and they went out into the world together. THE END A/N: I hope you enjoyed this story, and again, I'm soooo sorry it took me so long to finish it! But it's done now, and please feel free to post any comments. I like to know how I'm doing, so if you found something that needs editing, let me know. And of course, if you really liked it, I want to know that too! Two notes about this story: one, I know Eric Szmanda has brown eyes but I gave him blue here, sorry about that! The sequel will have them brown, and hopefully I'll get that fixed here someday soon. Two, Originally, before I took this chapter down for editing and completion, it was unfinished at chapter 12. When it was completed, the chapters were realigned and now it finishes at 12 chapters, which is why one comment says \"please continue\" at the last chapter. Also for your information there might be a sequel coming out sometime in the future called \"I'll Be Your Angel\". It was hand written a long time ago for the show, before this piece was ever even dreamed of. So, if it does become a sequel to this, it's going to need some major updating to flow with this piece, as well as to be typed up in the first place! You want a short description of it? Here you go: \"Angela is injured in the line of duty and possibly disabled for the rest of her life. Will she be able to keep her job and will the only guy she's ever loved stick by her side through the pain?\" Written up on the fly, so it's not perfect, but let me know what you think! Do you want to read this story? I'd love to hear your reactions! Thanks all! And thanks for reading Still Running, even if you don't post a comment, and especially if you started reading it years ago before I finished it. Sorry for the wait, and thanks for sticking with it! You guys rock! ","Summary":" The Net: Still Running A/N: Just so you all know, this is about the TV show, and NOT the movie!

Thanks! âœ  Guards on either side of Angela and behind her held AK-47s at the ready as Trelawney lead her down a long hallway. Just the day before she and Jacob had been minding their own business, plotting revenge against the Praetorians when they'd been set upon by Sean himself. The last thing she remembered before waking up in a cold dark room was a cloth covering her mouth. When she'd woken up, she was on a cement floor of an empty room and her hands were handcuffed behind her back. After spending a night pacing the dark room her enemy had finally come to collect her to do whatever evil deed he had planned. She could only hope he was taking her to see Jacob before he possibly finished her off for good. Sean took her into a room reminiscent of a high-tech hospital's emergency surgery room complete with medical equipment ranging from stethoscopes to computerized surgery devices. He stepped aside, to allow Angela a better view of the room. She saw a sleek metal operating table, and on that table, was Jacob. He looked to be unconscious, and he was strapped to the table. \"Jacob! What did you do to him! Is he OK!\" \"Oh, he's just fine. No need to worry. Now, if you just sit right here, then maybe he'll come around soon.\" \"What's that supposed to mean? How is my sitting down supposed to help him? That doesn't make any sense!\" \"Oh trust me, it will. It will. Now, just sit in this chair here.\" Sean motioned to a chair nearby. Angela sat down and before she could say anything the guards had her hands uncuffed and strapped to the chair. \"What's going on! What are you doing! Get away from me!\" Trelawney had pulled out a syringe and handed it to a doctor in a lab coat who had just entered the room. He began aiming it for her arm. Angela tried to move, but the restraints prevented her from doing so. She felt the slight pain of the needle entering her skin, and she closed her eyes tight. A few minutes later she felt the needle moving a bit. She opened one eye to see that he was changing the vile, taking out the previous empty one now filled with a red liquid and inserting another empty vile. Her whole body shivered and she closed her eye again. She didn't know exactly how long she sat there, but she was beginning to feel a little faint. And then, the needle was taken out of her arm. She was handed a glass of water as Sean emptied all ten vials of her blood into a sippy cup meant for children. He then covered it, and sat it down on a nearby table. Suddenly, Jacob began to stir and wake up. \"Angel?\" He looked in her direction. \"Where are we? What happened?\" \"Here kid, drink this and you'll feel a lot better,\" the doctor instructed as he handed Jacob the sippy cup, after unstrapping him from the table. Jacob took the cup from him and gulped down it's contents like there was no tomorrow. When he'd finished, he licked his lips and looked around for more. His eyes widened when Sean Trelawney came into his view. \"Hello, Jacob Resh.\" \"YOU! What's going on! What did you do to her?\" \"Oh I wouldn't worry about Angela, after all, you're the one on the operating table.\" \"What?\" \"You want to know what you just drank that tasted so good?\" Jacob didn't say anything, just stared at the man. \"That was Angela's blood.\"[Chapter 2] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 2 A/N:nI should also place a thank you to those who have comments on thenpreviously unedited version! Thanks! You guys rock! (And help me tonkeep my pen in gear on the paper!) âœ  Jacobnnearly choked when he heard Trelawney's words. \"Pardon me?\" \"Younheard me. And from now on, that's the only thing that will keep younalive.\" \"Whâ€¦whaâ€¦.what?\" \"Wenchanged your genes to that of a vampire. Vampires, as you know, drinknblood, and only blood. But we made you a little special. Not just anynblood will do for you. We took a sample of Angela's blood awhilenback when she'd been shot. Yeah, she left quite a bit of bloodnlying around. So, we took some and formulated your genes to hernblood. So, you're slightly different than that of a regularnvampire.You have to have Angela's blood and no one else's. Or younwill die.\" Seanntook the restraints off Angela and left the room with the doctor.nJacob got off the table and backed cautiously away from Angela. \"Pleasentell me I didn't just drink your blood! Please tell me I didn't!\"nhe begged, looking very frightened to know that her blood had tastednso good. Angelangulped. \"You did.\" Jacob wilted to the floor on the spot. She rannto him and knelt over his body. \"Wake up! Come on Jacob! Wake up!\" Slowlynhe opened his eyes and looked up at her. \"Angel, I'm scared. Indon't want to drink your blood!\" \"It'snOK. Don't think about that now! I just need you to help me findnaway out of here.\" \"um,nyeah, OK.\" Angelanhelped him to his feet, and they left the room, finding no guards innthe hallway. They searched for a way out, finding an unguarded doornnot too far from the surgical room. They slipped out into the inkynblack night. They found the way back to their hotel room and bothncollapsed wearily on the bed. \"Thatnwas too easy an escape,\" Jacob commented. \"Ofncourse it was. Now he doesn't have to keep chasing us. With you thenway you are now, we're both guaranteed to die, no matter whatnhappens to him. And maybe because you're different light won'tnaffect you. If you go out into light and die, that leaves me stillnalive, which defeats his purpose.\" Angelanshivered. She'd said it so calmly, as if she were talking aboutnLouis and Lestat from Interview With a Vampire. But then the realitynhit her. She wasn't talking about some characters from a novel or anmovie. She was talking about Jacob. Her best friend. This wasn'tnfiction. This was real life. \"Angel,nit's not true. What he said. I'm not going to believe it at all.nWhat I drank was just cranberry juice, or something. Now, I am goingnto bed and when I get up in the morning I'm going to have a hugenplate of scrambled eggs, toast, and bacon. And I'm going to enjoynit! Good night, Angel.\" Jacobnpromptly turned over and fell asleep. Angela got up and went over tonthe other bed. She slowly got underneath the covers and turned outnthe light. Lying on her side, she watched Jacob's outline rise andnfall as he breathed, before she too, fell asleep. âœ  Thennext morning Jacob had his plate of scrambled eggs, toast, and baconnfor breakfast. Angela had a bowl of cereal. Afterwards, they packedntheir things and went to another hotel in another town. \"God,nI am so hungry!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Butnyou practically just had breakfast!\" \"Inknow, I know.\" Theynsat around the room until it was lunch time, with nothing else to do.nJacob ate THREE ham and cheese sandwiches along with a tall glass ofnmilk. Several days went by. Jacob kept eating regular food, and lotsnof it. But something was wrong. He was getting weaker, staying in bednmore, and his clothes seemed to be getting too big for him. \"Jacob,nwhat's wrong?\" Angela finally asked. \"Indon't know,\" he spoke as if something was in his mouth. \"Comenon, sit up and I'll massage your back and shoulders for you.\" Jacobnweakly sat up. Angela put her hands on his shoulders, but immediatelynpulled them away. \"What?\"nThere was still something in his closed mouth. Shencautiously touched his arm and drew back her hand in horror. \"Jacob,ncan you take your shirt off?\" he shook his head. \"Do you mind ifnI?\" He shook his head 'no' again. Gently, she lifted the shirt,nbut before she was able to get it off, it dropped back into place.n\"Oh my God. Jacob, you'reâ€¦.I can clearly see each of yournribs! And every other bone you've got! How come you never toldnme about this!\" He just looked sadly at her, his mouth closed.n\"Jacob? What's in your mouth? Why won't you talk to me?\" Hensaid nothing. \"Open your mouth.\" He shook his head. \"JACOB!nNOW!\" He only shook his head harder. \"Jacob! Please!\" shenbegged. Slowlynhis mouth opened to reveal a set of vampire-like fangs. Angela jumpednback and he closed his mouth. \"Indidn't want to scare you,\" he said.[Chapter 3] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 3 \"Ohnmy God. Um OK, Jacob you just lie back down and I'll be rightnback!\" Angela said, getting up and going to the door. \"Don'tnleave me, Angel! Please don't!\" \"It'snOK, I'll be back soon!\" And with that, she was gone. Shencame back awhile later with a small bag and a mug. The bag she put onnthe table, the mug she took to the bed. She gently lifted Jacob'snhead off the pillow and put the cup to his lips. \"Here, drinknthis.\" \"No.nAngel, I won't. I can't. I told you before I'm not going tondrink this.\" He pushed the cup away. \"Jacob,nyou don't have a choice. I'm not just going to stand aside and donnothing while you starve to death.\" \"Angelâ€¦..\" \"Drink.\" Henlooked up at her. His eyes were filled with sadness. \"Angel, Indon't want to hurt you. Please don't.\" \"Jacob,ncome on, you have to. I don't want to lose you, no matter whatnhappens, you're still my best friend. I don't care if you have tondrink my blood to live. I'll do whatever it takes to keep younalive. Now, will you please hurry up and drink this?\" She put thencup back to his lips and he reluctantly gulped it down. \"Why don'tnyou go to sleep for awhile, I'm sure you'll feel much better whennyou wake up.\" \"Angel,nyou're not going to leave me, are you?\" \"No,nI won't leave you.\" She put the cup on the night table and layndown beside him. \"Just close your eyes and go to sleep. I'm notngoing anywhere.\" Shenput an arm around him tentatively. When she did, she could feel hisnribs slightly less than before. Her blood was working fast inside hisnbody. They both fell asleep and didn't wake up until it was dinnerntime and Angela got up to draw more blood for Jacob with the needlenfrom the small bag. âœ  Everydaynfor breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she would draw a cupful of her ownnblood and give it to Jacob to drink. And everyday, he got stronger,nhis ribs and bones stopped showing, and his fangs receded completelyninto his gums from lack of use. He started to leave the hotel roomnmore often. They would go out and do things together, like shopping,nor going to the movies. They began to have a life again, except fornthe fact that Sean Trelawney was still chasing them and Jacobncouldn't eat in public. \"Angel,ndon't look now,\" Jacob said one day while they were out on thenstreet. \"But Sean's standing over there. He saw us! Run!\" Jacobngrabbed her arm, and together they ran up the street. \"Innhere! Hurry! He won't find you in here!\" Angela and Jacobnfollowed the youngish voice into a dark doorway. Theynslipped through the door and into a dark room. Hands thrust them intona closet and closed the door behind them, just as the main door wasnpushed open menacingly. \"What'snthis? Who are you? What's going on?\" an elderly man's voicenasked. \"I'mnlooking for a teenage boy and a girl in her twenties. They came innhere,\" Sean said. \"No.nNo one came in,\" the older man replied. \"No one's been in herenfor years besides myself. I think I would know if someone else was innhere.\" \"Yes,nwell, I'm very sorry to disturb you.\" Thendoor was opened and shut, Trelawney having left the building. Thencloset door was opened allowing Jacob and Angela to come out. Whennthey did, they found Mariano standing before them. \"Mariano!nWhat are you doing here!\" Angela asked. \"Justnhelping out an old friend. Come on we've got to get you out of herenand out to the Compound. Thanks Dad,\" he said to the older man. \"Nontime to explain! Let's go!\" Angelanand Jacob were shuffled out to a waiting car out back by several mennwearing dark clothing and carrying heavy machine guns. \"What'snthe Compound?\" Angela asked when the car was underway. \"We'venformed a military group and we were just waiting to find you two. Nownthat we have, we're ready to move.\" \"Whatndoes that mean?\" \"We'renattacking Praetorian Headquarters tomorrow.\" \"Younknow where it is!\" \"Justnfound it. And tomorrow, we go in.\"[Chapter 4] The Net: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 4 The Compound, they learned when they got there, was an underground bunker with a store room full of weapons, a meeting room, and several bedrooms. \"OK, it's getting late, you should get some sleep for tomorrow. Jacob, there's one bed left in the guy's room. Angela, I'll show you to your room,\" Mariano said. \"No. He stays with me,\" Angela countered. \"What?\" \"You wouldn't understand if I told you.\" \"Alright, fine, if that's the way you want it. Follow me. I'll show you to your room.\" He led them down the hall to a small bedroom. \"I'll see you in the morning. Tomorrow we go in there with guns blazing!\" with that, Mariano left them alone. Angela sat down on the double bed and pulled out a syringe from her back pack. Jacob turned and watched the closed door for intruders as she stuck the needle into her arm and began drawing blood. \"It's ready,\" she said when the cup was full. Jacob went over and took it from her. He drained it and licked it clean while Angela put the syringe away. \"Get some sleep. We'll talk in the morning.\" \"There's only one bed, Angel.\" \"And it's a double. Get in, we'll make this work.\" \"Alright, if you say so.\" Angela turned away from Jacob and began to change into her night clothes. When she was done and had turned back, Jacob was already in bed lying on his side. She got into bed behind him and put an arm around him, holding him close. \"Don't worry, everything will be alright.\" \"I hope so.\" âœ  The next day after Jacob had his breakfast privately, in their bedroom and Angela had eaten with everyone else, they all met in the meeting room to discuss the events of the day. \"OK, Angela, we need you to go in with us. Here's your gun.\" She took the weapon Mariano offered her. \"And last, but not least, Jacob, we need you to bypass security and get us in there. Can you do that?\" Jacob slowly nodded. \"Good. I want everyone ready. We leave in five,\" Mariano finished. \"Angel, we need to talk.\" Jacob led her back to their room. \"Angel, what if something happens to you? What am I going to do?\" She was already writing something on a sheet of paper. \"Here,\" she said, handing it to him. \"This will hopefully ensure that no matter what happens to me, you'll get my body, also hopefully, before my blood's gone.\" Jacob read the note, then just stared at her. \"So you can keep yourself alive for as long as you can.\" \"Oh God.\" Jacob sat down hard on the bed with his head in his hands. \"I couldn'tâ€¦.I just couldn'tâ€¦..\" \"We're out of time. We have to go.\" Angela pulled him to his feet and they went to join the others. During the quiet ride, Jacob recalled every word of Angela's note with a tremor in his heart: \"To whom it may concern, no matter what happens to me, my body, under any circumstances, must go to a certain Jacob Resh, BEFORE I go anywhere else!\" It was signed \"A.B.\" When they got to their destination he realized that they were at a bank. Mariano went in with his men first. Angela and Jacob followed behind. When they were finally allowed entrance, everyone had been locked up in the vault. \"But,\" Mariano said. \"That's not all the people. Get going Jacob.\" Angela squeezed his shoulder and he went to work on the computer in front of him. He looked up from his work briefly to see Angela head down a flight of stairs along with the others. He went back to work, unlocking the doors that she would encounter along the way. Not being able to communicate with her was the worst part of it all. She was going into danger without him, in a sense. This had almost nothing to do with him needing her to live. No, this went deeper than anything he'd known or felt before in his life. He didn't know what it was, only that he had to keep his mind on business or else something could go wrongâ€¦â€¦. Finally, Jacob was able to unlock the very last door. He could only hope for the best and hope that he'd see her again. He crossed his fingers. \"OK, kid, put your hands up and don't move!\" Jacob did as he was told, but turned around slowly to face several armed policemen.[Chapter 5] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 5 Everynsingle gun was aimed at him. One of the policemen put his weapon awaynand handcuffed Jacob's hands behind his back. The others left thenroom and ran down the stairs Angela had taken with Mariano. Jacob wasnpushed out to a police cruiser and put in the back seat. The copnstood guard outside. A few minutes later Jacob watched as Angela andnMariano were led out in handcuffs along with a few of Mariano'snmen. Angela stopped by the police car that held Jacob. \"CannI talk to him for a second, please?\" she begged the cop. He lookednat Jacob with his sad face and opened the door. \"Hey, don'tnworry,\" she said. \"Everything's going to be fine. I'll get usnboth out of this fix and then we'll be free of this whole messnforever. OK?\" \"So,nyou mean you really are A.B. and not L.M.?\" \"Yes,nJacob, I really am Angela.\" Jacobnsmiled quickly at her, before she was lead away to another policencruiser. They were all put into prison, each, at opposite ends of thenbuilding. For three days, Angela said nothing to anyone. She couldn'tnstop thinking about Jacob, and how he must be starving. But was henOK, other than that? Was he being treated OK? She had no way ofnknowing. No way at all. Nor did she have any idea how to get them allnout of there. âœ  \"Ms.nBennett, there's someone here to see you,\" a guard said,nunlocking the cell door. \"Jacob?\"nshe asked, hopefully expectant. \"No.nIt's a Mr. Walter Cizelski.\" \"Who?\" \"Anlawyer or something. You're very inquisitive today, aren't you?\" Angelanwas quiet again on the walk to the interrogation room. Walter wasnthere, in a plain brown suit sitting at the table. \"Arenyou my lawyer?\" she asked. \"Because of you are, there's anothernguy here who needs your help as well.\" \"No,nAngela, I'm not your lawyer. Because you don't need one. Look,nI'm here to give you a job opportunity, and if you take it, well,nlet's just say it's your 'get out of jail free card.'\" \"Tellnme more.\" \"Well,nI work for the FBI and they want me to head up a subdivision of it,nknown as the CIC. Center For Internet Control. I would send you outnto Quantico for training and then you'd work for me, policing theninternet, and stopping computer crime. What do you say to that?\" \"Iâ€¦..thisnis too good to be true!\" \"Inhave been studying up on your case. I know what you've beennthrough. Look, I know you might not trust me, but right now, I don'tnthink you've got any other choice. You know they'll put you awaynfor life if they want. I wouldn't take those chances if I werenyou.\" \"IfnI take this, will you let my friends go?\" \"Alreadyndone. I just watched Mariano and his buddies leave before I came innhere.\" \"AndnJacob? What about him?\" \"I'mnafraid he's going to have to stay. He's just a kid yet. A littlenjail time would do him some good. Teach him what he's done.\" \"No!nYou don't understand! You have to let him go! Look, I want both ofnus, Jacob, and I, out of here TODAY! If you can't handle that, thennforget the job.\" \"OK,nfine. I'll see what I can do.\"[Chapter 6] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 6 Annhour later Angela was set free. After she had changed out of thenorange jump suit, and back into her own clothes, she stood besidenWalter, and waited for Jacob. \"Whynisn't he here yet?\" she asked after they'd been standing therenfor a long while. Anguard walked over to them. \"We have a problem, sir,\" she spoke tonWalter. \"The boy won't leave his cell. He keeps asking to seenAngela.\" \"Alright,nlet's go.\" Thenthree of them went to Jacob's cell, where a crowd of guards andndoctors had gathered. Angela and Walter pushed their way through tonthe cell and found the door wide open. Jacob was huddled in thencorner, knees brought up to his chest and arms around his knees. Hisnbright orange suit looked huge on him. \"He'snbeen like that all day,\" a doctor said. \"And he hasn't eatennanything since he got here!\" Everyonenwas staring at him like a monkey in a cage, waiting to see what henwould do next. Angela rushed forward into the cell and fell to hernknees beside Jacob, wrapping her arms around him as she did so. \"Everything'sngoing to be OK, Jacob. I'm getting you out of here now.\" \"Thanks,nAngel,\" Jacob said weakly. Angelanlooked up at the crowd in front of the cell, still looking at him.nThe doctor wrote something on a clip board and looked back at thenteen. \"Something'sngoing to have to be done with him. I think something's wrongnmentally. We'll run some testsâ€¦..\" \"Leavenhim alone!\" Angela shouted, cutting him off. \"And stop staring atnhim like he's some kind of monster!\" Her arms encircled Jacobntighter. \"Because he's not a monster! He's a normal human beingnjust like you and I! Just go away and leave him alone!\" Thenguards and doctors left at Walter's nod. Angela carefully picked upnJacob's nearly rail thin body and left the cell. \"Hasnyour teeth grown back yet?\" she asked. \"Theynonly just started. They're still small yet.\" \"Good.\" Jacobnrested his head on her shoulder. \"Who's that guy?\" he asked,npointing to Walter. \"I'llnexplain later.\" \"Angela,ncan you please explain what's going on? What's wrong with him?nWhy won't he eat? And how can you just pick him up like that?\" \"Walter,nyou ask too many questions. Maybe someday I'll be able to tell you.nBut I can't right now. OK? You've got to trust me about this, thensame as I've got to trust you about that job.\" \"Yeah,nOK, fine. But I'm letting you know I don't like it.\" \"Fine.nJust leave us alone for a week. Give us time to recuperate.\" \"Indon't like this.\" \"Yeah,nwell you're not the one who's starving, now are you? I need tonget him home and take care of him as quickly as possible.\" \"Alright!nAlright! I got your old apartment back. Here.\" Walter handed hernthe keys. \"And, there's your car.\" He pointed up the street anways at a small blue car. \"Thanks.\"nAngela took the car keys from him and carried Jacob over to her car.nWalter followed to help with the doors. \"Look, Walter, I'll callnyou at the end of a week. I just want to spend some time with him andnmake sure he's OK.\" \"Alright.nHere's my number.\" Walter handed her a business card. \"But atnthe end we're going to have to talk about that job and sending younto Quantico .\" \"Sure.\" Then,nwith Jacob lying down in the back seat of her car, Angela drove homento her old apartment, which she hadn't seen in over a year. âœ  Enteringnher apartment, she found it just as she's left it that one rainynnight so long ago. Several dead plants were overturned, dirt spillingnout of their pots onto the floor. Her desk chair lay on the floornhalf way across the room from her computer which had been hacked intonand the insides stolen. The cushions from her sofa had been spreadnthroughout the apartment while the sofa itself was pulled away fromnthe wall. Shenfelt a tremor in her heart at the sight but she quickly ignored it.nShe had work to do. Holding the door open with a brick, she carriednJacob inside and set him down gently on her double bed. She pullednthe covers up over him. \"Jacob,nI'll be right back. I just have to go to the store.\" \"Angel,nI'm hungryâ€¦\" he whispered. \"Inknow, Jacob, I know. I'll be right back to get you something toneat.\" And with that, she quickly left. Whennshe came back, she thrust the new needle into her vein and beganndrawing blood. She grabbed a cup from the kitchen and filled it upnbefore bringing it to him. His eyes were closed when she saw him. \"Jacob,nJacob, wake up.\" Slowly his eyes opened. \"Here.\" She lifted hisnhead off the pillow and held the cup to his lips. He began to drink.nHe breathed deeply when he was done. \"Thanks,nAngel.\" \"Nonproblem. Just try to get some sleep,\" she said, resting a hand onnhis warm forehead. She brushed his hair back from his beautiful blueneyes. \"Wherenare you going?\" he asked, his voice slightly stronger. \"I'mnjust going to clean this place up, since Sean messed it all up. Don'tnworry, I'm not going far. Alright?\" Just call me if you neednanything.\" Jacobntried to nod but his eyes closed and he fell asleep before he could.nAngela left the room and quietly closed the door behind her. She thennwent about putting her apartment back to order, after the trauma itnhad seen over a year ago.[Chapter 7] The Net: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 7 \"Angel!\" Angela heard Jacob call her name a few hours later. She looked at her watch. It was time for dinner. Almost without a second thought, she drew some blood and filled a mug. She took it to him and sat down on the edge of the bed while Jacob drank the mug dry. \"How are you feeling?\" she asked when he was done. \"Much better, thanks to you.\" \"That's good. And those teeth?\" \"Happily going away.\" \"Awesome!\" \"Angel, can you tell me what happened? With Sean? And that guy you were with today?\" \"Well, we went in with guns blazing. I got my name changed a lot of people died, and we got arrested, as you know. But I have no idea what happened to Sean.\" \"Oh, and the guy?\" \"He's going to be my new boss. He asked me to work for him in the CIC, which stands for Center for Internet Control, which is a division of the FBI.\" \"How the heck did you manage that!\" \"I don't know. But I told him I wouldn't take it unless he got you out of jail. He did and I have to call him in a week after you're well again. And after that, I do believe we're off to Quantico .\" \"Cool!\" \"Yeah, it is. Now, you get some rest while I get my own dinner and then I'll be back.\" \"Yeah, OK.\" Angela stood up and went to the door. \"Hey, Angel?\" She turned back. \"What?\" \"You have a nice apartment.\" \"Thanks.\" âœ  One week later, Jacob was back on his feet and feeling fine as they stood in front of a small music store. \"Now, you're sure you're up to this?\" \"Yes.\" \"OK. Are those teethâ€¦â€¦\" \"Angel! They're gone! OK? Now, let's just go in there and get this over with!\" \"OK, alright. Let's go.\" Together, they walked into the store. A man in his thirties stood behind the counter. \"Angela.\" \"Walter. This is Jacob. Jacob, this is Walter.\" \"Hi. Um, I guess I should thank you for getting me out of there,\" Jacob said. \"No problem. OK, Angela, we need to talk about Quantico . Um, can we talk in the back room?\" Walter glanced in Jacob's direction. \"Yeah, sure. I'll be back,\" she said to Jacob, who watched her follow Walter into the back room before he began to wander around the music store, checking out the CD's for sale. Mostly though, it was all Mozart, and Bach, and any other classical artist known to man. All boring stuff. He didn't listen in on Angela's conversation with Walter until he heard her say twelve words: \"I'll go, but only as long as you grant me one favor.\" Then, he was all ears. \"Alright,\" Walter was saying. \"I'll give you one favor, depending on what it is.\" \"I need you to let Jacob come with me.\" \"Nope. Sorry. I can't do that.\" \"Well, you have no choice, either I don't go to Quantico and don't work for you or else Jacob comes with me and I do go and work for you. It's your choice. What's it gonna be?\" There was a deep silence in the back room for awhile, and then Walter finally spoke, \"Alright. Fine. He can go. BUT, I don't want him getting in the way and causing trouble.\" \"Don't worry. I promise he won't get into trouble.\" âœ  That following week, the three of them boarded a plane and flew out to Quantico, Virginia where Angela was to start her FBI training. Jacob went to all of her training sessions and watched her learn to fight and to shoot. \"OK, Angel, I'm going to try to block any move you make, alright?\" he said, standing in the practice ring opposite her. \"Are you sure you want to do this? I could hurt you, you know.\" \"Sure you could. But you need to practice and you need someone to practice with. Besides, after all I've done to you, I deserve any pain you put me in.\" \"Jacob, don't say that. You can't help what happened.\" \"Are you gonna practice or what?\" Angela sighed and began to throw some punches at him. With the blue pads, he blocked every move. \"You're getting good at this, Jacob.\" \"That's what I get for watching you, I guess.\" She broke off from the punches and randomly threw in some kicks among other things. These were not always blocked, though she never kicked hard enough to hurt him. \"Come on, let's get this show on the road, shall we?\" Angela said, throwing another punch at him. Jacob threw down the pads and blocked her with his arm. As he did so, his other hand turned into a fist and sailed into her stomach. Her right arm came down to sweep his hand away before grabbing hold of his other wrist. Pulling him forward she twisting around to hold his arm over her shoulder. \"Aaach! You're good!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Yes, that was good,\" John, her trainer said, coming in. \"Looks like you need to brush up a bit, Jacob,\" \"Yeah, I noticed,\" Jacob said, with a slight smile. \"Alright, you can end this and go practice your shooting now. After that I'll let you go to lunch,\" John said before he left. \"Why did he have to mention lunch?\" Jacob asked. \"Can you wait for awhile?\" \"I think so.\" \"Good, let's go.\" Together, they went out to the shooting range. Jacob sat on a bench several yards away and watched Angela as she shot several bulls eyes in a row. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye Jacob saw someone turn out of the line of FBI trainees practicing their shooting skills. He was standing up and running in two seconds when he saw the man aim his weapon straight at Angela.[Chapter 8] The Net: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 8 Jacob screamed Angela's name as he tackled the guy. The man fell to the ground and his gun slid a short distance away. Jacob turned him over and stared in shock at Sean Trelawney lying on the grass below him. \"Ah, so you're still alive, Resh. How's Angela? She run out of blood yet?\" Jacob punched him in the face, making his nose bleed. \"You should know! You were about to kill her!\" \"Was I? I had no idea.\" Letting his anger build up inside him until he couldn't hold it in any longer, Jacob proceeded to beat him into a bloody pulp. Punch after punch, he kept it up, letting his anger out through each hit. Before he knew what was happening, gentle hands were pulling him to his feet. He found himself wrapped in Angela's arms. He felt her body shudder when she saw who was lying on the ground. She held him tighter. Both Walter and the paramedics arrived on the scene. \"He's dead,\" one of the paramedics told Walter before carrying Sean away on a stretcher. \"What's going on? Who was that?\" Walter asked. \"That was Sean Trelawney,\" Angela said, her arms still around Jacob. \"Heâ€¦.he wasâ€¦.a praetorian. Third in command. He escaped that day we were arrested.\" \"He was going to kill her,\" Jacob said. \"I saw him. He had his gun out. He was going to kill her!\" \"It's OK, Jacob. I'm OK. We're all OK. Come on, let's go back to my room for awhile.\" Angela led him back to the single room she lived in while in training, leaving Walter to stare after them. They sat on Angela's bed and she held his head against her chest to try to comfort him. \"No. Angel, I can't do this. I can't be near you,\" he said a few minutes later. \"Why? What's wrong?\" \"I can smell your blood. And my sense of smell had been growing stronger lately, especially when I'm near you and hungry.\" Angela let him go and got up to get the syringe and a cup. \"Remember, only half full. We can't have you collapsing on the field.\" \"I know, I know.\" There was a knock at the door as Angela handed the cup to Jacob. Quickly she put away the syringe and went to answer the door. Walter came in. \"We need to talk,\" he said. \"About Jacob.\" \"What about him?\" Angela went over to the bed where Jacob was sitting. She took the clean cup from him and set it on the night stand. \"He killed a man today. Please don't pretend you don't know that. You know what this means. He has to go to court andâ€¦â€¦.\" \"No! He can't!\" Angela sat down behind Jacob and put her arms around him again. He just sat there and looked up at Walter along with Angela. Both had a certain sadness in their eyes. \"Angela, he spent time in jail for what he did before. Obviously that wasn't enough.\" \"Look, Walter, I was trying to regain my identity then, he was only helping. You have no idea what the Praetorians were like. What they could do. Sean was one of the worst of them all. He'd kill anyone in an instant if he had to, just to get what he wants.\" \"He was going to kill her!\" Jacob spoke up. \"I was only protecting her! I only did what I had to!\" \"Look, the main thing this comes down to, is that Iâ€¦..weâ€¦.need you to protect him from the law and any Praetorians still out there, if there are any, or else I can't take that job. I know I keep asking you for things, but it's only because he can't go to jail. We can't be separated for longer than a day. And, no, I can't tell you why. Maybe someday, but not now. You wouldn't understand. Can you just trust me on this? Please?\" Walter thought it over then sighed. \"I don't know why, but I'm going to say yes.\" \"Thank you, Walter. Thank you so much!\" âœ  Several weeks later, Angela stepped off the small stage and into Jacob's waiting arms. \"You did it! You made it!\" he exclaimed. \"You graduated from Quantico! I knew you could do it!\" She hugged him back, thanking him, before walking to the back of the room to see Walter, her arm draped around Jacob's shoulders. \"Well, you finally made it. Welcome aboard.\" \"Thanks,\" she said as they shook hands. âœ  \"I'm back, Angela!\" Walter called from the music store half of the CIC two months later. \"I brought us lunch!\" \"Um, yeah, OK! I'll be out in a minute!\" she called from the back room as she quickly pulled the needle from her arm. The curtain separating the two rooms flew back and Walter came in, carrying a paper bag. He stopped in his tracks when he saw her, sitting at her desk with a syringe and mug full of red liquid. Angela looked up and gulped.[Chapter 9] The Net: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 9 \"What's going on?\" She stood up. \"Don't ask.\" She gathered up the supplies and covered the mug. \"Just don't ask.\" She walked past him, taking the paper bag from him. \"Is this my lunch?\" \"Um, yeahâ€¦.\" Walter dumbly stared after her as she left the store, got into her car, and drove away. She arrived at Jacob's college dorm a few minutes later, to find him already waiting for her, holding the door ajar with his foot so it wouldn't lock him out. \"Boy am I glad to see you! You have no idea!\" He let her inside. \"Well, my roommate is gone for awhile so we have the room to ourselves.\" \"That's good because we need to talk.\" \"About what?\" Jacob led her upstairs to the second floor, room 234. \"I'll tell you later.\" When they were finally in his room with the door closed and locked and sitting on his bed eating and drinking their lunch she explained what had happened. \"So, he knows?\" Jacob asked, when she'd finished. \"No. He doesn't. Well, not everything. I don't want to have to explain to him what he saw. Neither of us is going to tell him, not one word. OK?\" \"Course. Wouldn't dream of it. I don't think I want to know what he'd do if he found out.\" \"Me too.\" \"So, what are we going to do for dinner tonight?\" \"My place? Six pm ?\" \"I'm there.\" \"Yeah, I know you are.\" âœ  Having no classes, Jacob spent the next day at CIC with Angela. And after spending the whole morning in the back room doing nothing but watching her work, he suddenly walked back out into the music store, without a single word. Angela got up and went to the doorway. \"Jacob?\" He only looked at her sadly and retreated to the other side of the room. Walter, who'd been standing behind the counter, watched them. \"What's going on?\" he asked. Angela nodded in Jacob's direction. \"His nerves are acting up. I'll have to get his medication.\" \"What? I didn't know about this!\" \"Of course, do you think we'd tell the whole world about it?\" \"Wellâ€¦..Iâ€¦.\" \"Jacob, I just remembered that I don't have it with me so you'll have to come with me.\" He madly shook his head just as the phone began to ring. \"I can't do it!\" he choked out. Walter answered the phone and a few seconds later he hung up. \"I've gotta go! Someone's got a lead on that virus creator guy we've been looking for. I'll be back soon. Don't need backup!\" And with that, Walter was gone. \"Angel, please don't tell me you don't haveâ€¦.\" \"I do. Don't worry, it's in my car.\" Quickly she ran out to the car and came back with the supplies. She went into the back room and stayed there for several long minutes. When she finally came out, she held a cup in her hand, which she set down on the counter. She went back into the other room as Jacob took the cup and gulped its contents down. He followed her. \"Thanks Angel. You don't know how much better I feel.\" \"Yeah, can you tell me what happened?\" \"It was my sense of smell acting up again and I had deep hunger pains all of a sudden. The only thing I could smell was your blood. I justâ€¦.I had to get away before I did something to hurt you.\" \"OKâ€¦â€¦.I think I get it.\" \"It's been happening to me. It seems to grow worse every time.\" \"So, am I to believe that when you suddenly get up and leave the roomâ€¦â€¦that means you'reâ€¦â€¦..you'reâ€¦..\" \"Yes, that means I'm hungry.\" Angela sat down at her desk. \"I guess I can handle that.\" \"Angel, you shouldn't have to handle this.\" Jacob set the cup down on her desk, licked spotlessly clean. He walked around the desk to her side and gave her a hug. \"This shouldn't be happening. You shouldn't have to go through this.\" \"Jacob, there's nothing we can do.\" \"Actually, there might be something.\" \"What?\" \"I can't tell you, and ruin the surprise. But I'll let you know if it works.\" He headed for the door. \"Jacob, wait!\" He turned back. \"Will I see you for dinner then?\" He hesitated only slightly before saying he would. He then left, with that same sadness in his eyes that had been there since Sean had turned him into a vampire, only now, it seemed to be deeper than ever possible. Angela missed the tear escape his eyes and roll down his cheek, as he walked away. âœ  Angela waited impatiently as the phone rang later on that night, until someone finally picked up. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, Walter, have you seen Jacob anywhere recently?\" \"No, why would I have seen him? What's wrong Angela?\" \"I haven't seen him since he left CIC at lunch time.\" \"Yeah, so what's wrong with that? He's a college student, what do you expect? He's probably just out partying with his friends.\" \"No! Jacob wouldn't do that. He's not into partying. Look, we were supposed to have dinner together and he never showed up. I called his dorm room and his roommate said he never came home after he left in the morning. It's now after eleven pm ! I'm worried about him! This isn't like him at all! Something's wrong!\" \"Angela, calm down. I'm sure nothing's wrong. He's in college. I'm sure he can take care of himself. Why don't you just go to bed and I'm sure he'll show up in the morning.\" \"You'd better be right!\" Angela hung up with her boss, and did as he'd instructed, though her heart told her something was terribly wrong. Something's just not right! I know it. Something's wrong but I don't know what to do! âœ  The next morning, while she drank a single cup of coffee for breakfast, the doorbell rang. She jumped from her chair, spilling coffee all over her bathrobe. She ran to the door and flung it open, expecting to see Jacob standing before her. \"Hi, ma'am, I just need you to sign for this package.\" It was a UPS delivery man in his brown uniform. \"What? What package? I didn't send for anything.\" \"Your name is Angela Bennett, right?\" \"Yes, that's me.\" \"Well, it says to Angela Bennett, right here. Can you sign here please?\" he handed her an electronic clip board and she signed her name. \"Who's it from?\" \"I don't know,\" he said, handing her the small box before going back to his truck. Angela went back inside her apartment. Quickly, she grabbed a knife and opened the box. Inside, she found a note and underneath that she found crumpled paper surrounding and cushioning a smaller box. She unfolded the note and read: Dear Angel, This is just something I wanted you to have. Take care of it for me, please. Whatever you do, Angel, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I just need sometime alone for awhile. Don't worry, I'll see you laterâ€¦. Love, Jacob[Chapter 10] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 10 Notnquite knowing how to react, Angela put down the note and picked upnthe smaller box. Upon getting it open she found Jacob's high schoolnclass ring. Her heart stopped for a moment as she took the ringncarefully out of the box and held it in her hands. I knew somethingnwas wrong. I knew it. Jacob's not coming back. He knows he can'tnstay alone for too long. God, I've got to find him! Angelanunconsciously slipped the ring onto her left ring finger and pickednup the phone. She dialed a number and waited while it rang on thenother end. \"Hello?\"ncame a groggy voice. \"Walter,nI'm not coming into work today.\" \"What'snwrong?\" \"Jacob'snin trouble and I need to find him. I don't know where he is.\" \"Angela,nyou don't know he's in trouble. He probably just forgot aboutndinner last night and right now he's most likely still out partyingnwith his friends.\" \"Jacobndoesn't party! How many times do I have to tell you that! And Indo know he's in trouble. He hasn't eaten since lunch yesterday.nDon't ask how I know. I just do. He also sent me a package in thenmail.\" \"What?nWhy would he do that? What's in it?\" \"Indon't know why he did it. But his class ring from high school wasnin it along with a note.\" \"Well,nwhat did it say?\" Angelanread him what Jacob had written. \"Don't you see how he's inntrouble? Can't you tell something's wrong?\" \"Apparentlynhe just wants time alone. I mean, you practically mother him all thentime. I'm surprised he hasn't left sooner.\" \"Walter!\" \"Sorry.\" \"Yeah,nwell why would he want time alone without his ring? What does thatnhave to do with anything?\" \"Hownshould I know?\" \"Look,nJacob hasn't been his normal self for about a year now. And younweren't there yesterday when he left. He had this really sadnexpression on his face.\" \"Whynisn't he himself?\" \"Iâ€¦Incan't really tell you.\" \"Whynnot? How can I help you if I don't know what's going on?\" \"Injustâ€¦..he's got some kind of disease. The doctors don't knownwhat it is. He won't eat unless I make him.\" \"Whyndidn't you tell me that sooner? I mean, I'll admit that doesn'tnmake much sense, but I'll go along with it anyway.\" \"Injust need you to help me find him. Come on Walter! This is urgent! Ifnhe doesn't eatâ€¦..\" \"OK,nOK, I'll meet you at the office in half an hour.\" \"Good,nand we're taking my car.\" \"Fine.\" Angelanhung up and got ready to go, ignoring the coffee she'd spiltnearlier. âœ  Innthe car, Angela gripped the steering wheel so hard her knuckles andneven her nails were white. Both arms were white too. She drove slowlynalong, her eyes peeled for signs of Jacob. \"Angela,nit's been five days. You've been driving for five days straight!nDon't you think it's been long enough? We've been all over thisncity. We haven't found him yet. I think we should either call thencops and file a missing person report or abandon this whole thing. Inmean, I don't know how you are able to stay awake. I haven'tnslept in five days and I'm tired. I can't keep going like this!\" Thencar braked to a sudden halt, surprising Walter. \"NO!nI'm not giving up! You wanna get out and go home! Then go! Get outnof here! I'll continue on my own! I don't need you! But I'm notngiving up until I find him!\" \"No,nI'll stay,\" he said wearily. \"Thisnis the longest he's ever been without food. And we're not callingnthe cops!\" Angela said as the car continued forward again. \"Whynnot?\" \"They'llncall for an ambulance. They won't know what's wrong with him ornhow to help him. I can't have that.\" Shenslowed down quickly to a sudden halt again, throwing Walter andnherself forward a bit. \"What?\"nhe asked. \"That'snhis car! That's Jacob's car!\" \"Whatnwould he be doing in the deserted parking lot of an old factorynfifteen miles out of town that's been empty for twenty-five years?\" Angelanignored him as she sped across the parking lot. She stopped justninches from Jacob's red Dodge Intrepid. She rushed over to the carnand looked inside. Jacob was there, lying in the backseat, his eyesnclosed, and his body rail thin again. She could plainly see his ribsnthrough his t-shirt. She tried the door but it was locked. So werenall the others. She looked around wildly for something to break thenwindow. Finding nothing, she quickly raised her elbow and smashed hernway into the car with a brute force neither Walter, nor she, evernrealized she had. She unlocked the door from the inside and climbednin alongside Jacob. She found a note in his hand. Prying it lose, shenread: Angel, I'mnso sorry, but this was just something I had to do. I couldn't bearnto see you hurting because of me. Having me around was only ruiningnyour life. This way is better for both of us. At least one of us willnsurvive Sean. I thank you for all you've done. You've been anwonderful friend, the best I've ever had. Thank you. Thank you sonmuch. May you live on to lead a wonderful life! I'm sure I'll seenyou on the other side when your time eventually comes. Thank you andngoodbye for now. Love,nJacob. Tearsnsprang to her eyes and rolled down her cheeks as her hand covered hernmouth. \"Oh my God! How could he do this to me! Jacob! No! You can'tndo this! No! You can't leave me!\" She brushed the tears from hernface with the back of her hand. \"So this is your big plan, huh?nThis is it? This is what you had in mind? The big plan you couldn'tntell me about! How could you! How!\"[Chapter 11] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 11 Quickly,nAngela looked around the car until she found an old mug in the frontnpassenger side seat. She grabbed it and a piece of glass from thenwindow and proceeded to cut her arm while Walter watched, very muchnconfused. A look of deep pain covered her face as she bit her lip tonkeep from screaming. Her eyes were shut tight, squeezing out tears ofnpain, as the glass slit her arm. She filled the mug with blood,nlacerating her arm several times to get enough blood. Finally,nWalter came to in a snap from his confused state. \"Angela! What arenyou doing! Do you want to kill yourself!\" Shenput the cup to Jacob's lips, now ignoring the pain in her arm andncommenting out loud, \"God, if he hasn't smelled me by nowâ€¦..Godnplease! Let him still be alive! Please! I'm begging you! Jacobnplease! Don't do this to me!\" \"Angela,nwhat's going on? What are you talking about? Him smelling you?nWhat's that about? I demand to know!\" Jacobnlips parted slightly by the cup and Angela could tell his fangs werenback again. She tilted the cup a little and watched as a little bitnof blood passed into his mouth. Immediately, his eyes popped open.nShe helped him sit up and held the cup to his lips again. He greedilyngulped it down, licking it clean afterwards. He then looked up atnAngela's obviously relieved face. \"Whyndid you do that, Angel?\" he finally asked. \"Yeah,nI would like to know that too!\" Walter said. Angelanlooked from her boss back to Jacob. \"I did it to save your life!nI'm not going to let you die Jacob. No matter what the reason! Indon't want to lose you.\" She took his ring off her finger andnplaced it back on his hand. \"Angel,nplease, I don't want you to have to go through this! Please!\"nJacob begged. \"I'mnsorry, Jacob, but I am going to go through this. I want to see younalive and well. I want to see you around. I'm not going to lose younand that's final. There's nothing more to tell you.\" Jacobnsighed and closed his eyes. \"Jacob?\" her voice was full ofnconcern. \"I'mnOK. I'm just weak andâ€¦..if I could get awayâ€¦â€¦I would.\" \"Right.nDon't worry, I'll have you home and taken care of in no time.\"nShe brushed some glass off his boney legs and got out of the car,nclosing the door gently behind her. She brushed glass out of the carnwheel's way. \"Walter, here are my keys, I need you to speed backnto my place as fast as you can. I'm going to follow you.nHurry!\"Angela jumped into Jacob's car, picked up his car keysnfrom the floor and started the engine. Walter already had thenflashing light on the roof of her car as she sped out of the parkingnlot. \"Hold on!\" she said to Jacob as she followed her car. âœ  Theynarrived safely at her front door not long after. Walter watched fromnthe bedroom doorway as she carried Jacob inside and put him in hernown bed. \"Walter, I'll talk to you in a few minutes.\" Shenclosed the door and went back to Jacob, taking the syringe from thendrawer of her night table, where she'd put it after coming homenfive nights ago. \"Angel,nplease don't! Not again so soon,\" Jacob begged weakly. \"IfnI don't, you'll die.\" \"Yournarm.\" Shenlooked down to see that her arm was still bleeding from the glassncuts. A long trickle of blood had slowly made its way down her whitenarm to her wrist. \"Oh.\" \"Here,nlet me? I think I can make it stop bleeding. Can I?\" Jacobnweakly reached out for her arm. She let him have it, not knowing whatnelse to do. Trying to ignore what was happening to her, she closednher eyes. It was one thing to fill a cup with a syringe, and have himndrink from that. But to have his tongueâ€¦.licking her arm, that wasnanother thing all together! She knew though, that if he didn't,nshe'd be wasting precious blood, and he needed all that she couldnspare. Slowly, his tongue made its way up her arm to the many slashnmarks made by the car's window glass. Gently, he began to suck onnthe bleeding slits in her skin. She was acutely aware of his fangsntouching her skin and she knew he could easily have sucked her dry.nThis could be her death. She had to put all of her trust into him.nFeeling his mouth on her arm, gently sucking her blood, she began tonrelax, succumbing to his blood searching mouth, letting him have hisnway with her arm. He sucked lightly, never too hard, as her bloodnflowed easily at first into his waiting mouth. And then, just asnquickly as it had started, he was finished. He licked the slits a fewnextra times to ensure no more blood would escape her body, and thennhe let her arm go. She slowly opened her eyes and looked at him. \"Indon't think it'll bleed anymore. Just wrap it in something, anhuge band-aid or something. OK?\" \"Yeah,nsure.\"She looked at her arm. Though she could still see where she'dncut herself, there was no more blood. She looked back at him.n\"Thanks.\" \"Nonproblem. Are you going to tell him the truth? I mean, he saw usnbefore, in the car,\" Jacob said, referring back to Walter, stillnwaiting for Angela to talk to him. \"Indon't knowâ€¦.\" \"Justntell him. If he leaves us, we'll deal with it. We've dealt withnworse before. We'll deal with whatever happens. Now, Walter's outnthere waiting, and then get some rest yourself.\" \"Yeah.\"nShe looked at him for a few seconds before leaning over and kissingnhim gently on the lips. When she pulled away his eyebrows were raisednin surprise and amazement. \"Jacob, just please promise me you won'tndo that again. You really scared me when you did that.\" \"Inpromise.\" \"Thanks.nI'm just glad to have you back safe and sound.\"[Chapter 12] ThenNet: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 12 \"OK,ncan we talk now?\" Walter asked when she came out of the room tonwash the cup in the sink. \"Yes.nWhat do you want to know?\" \"Inknow the last time he ate was five days ago, but I could clearly seenhis bones.à¾­nThatnshouldn't happen that quickly, should it? And then his teeth.nSomething was wrong with them. I didn't get a good look at them,nbut I could definitely tell something was wrong. And then the capernof it all, you gave him blood to drink and it woke him up!nItâ€¦..itâ€¦.it made him better somehow! I don't understand. What'sngoing on with him?\" \"Firstnof allâ€¦..\" Angela felt woosey and light-headed suddenly as shenstruggled to hold on to the edge of the sink. Her grip wasn'tnstrong enough and she collapsed on the floor. \"Arenyou OK?\" Walter grabbed a hold of her arm to support her. \"Hownmuch blood did you give him?\" \"Notnenough. I need to go lie down,\" she said as he helped her to thencouch in the living room. He sat in a chair facing her. \"Now, as Inwas saying, first of all, there's nothing wrong with Jacob'snteeth. Nothing at all.\" \"Whatndo you mean? I sawâ€¦I don't know what, but he's never had teethnlike that before!\" \"Ofncourse. They're fangs. You've probably never seen fangs before.nEspecially in a human.\" \"WHAT!\" \"Donyou believe in vampires?\" \"Whatndoes that have to do with anything?\" \"Justnanswer the question.\" \"Well,nI don't know. I'm not sure.\" \"Younbelieve in Big Foot, right?\" \"Um,nyeah, I guess so. Why?\" \"Thennit shouldn't be too hard for someone like you to believe innvampires.\" \"Oh.nI supposeâ€¦.\" \"Look,nJacob is a vampire.\" Therenwas a deep silence in the room. Angela looked up at the ceiling,navoiding Walter's stare. She'd spilled the truth. Now all she hadnto do was wait for him to think it over and make a reply. She couldnenvision him yelling and running out of the room. She'd never seenhim again. She'd have to move. Take Jacob somewhere else. Findnanother job. Somehow, keep him safe. But keep him safe she would,nsomehow, someway, until the end, when she ran out of blood for him.nShe would do it no matter what it took. \"OK,\"nWalter said slowly. \"How? Why? He wasn't born that way, was he?\" \"Younwanna know how ruthless the Praetorians are? Sean made him this way.nBefore that he was a normal guy. But Sean kidnaped us and changednJacob's genes to that of a vampire who requires only blood tonlive.\" A scared look quickly covered Walters face, as if he wasnwondering why he was there, in an apartment with a starving vampirenwho could easily kill him. \"But it's not as simple as that,\"nAngela continued. \"Only blood will keep him alive and normal foodndoes nothing for him. In the beginning he ate more food than I'venseen all at one time and he grew as thin as he is now. It gets evennworse though, and here's where you don't have to worry about yournown life. He can only drink my blood. Sean had his vampire genesntuned to my blood. I guess is a good way to put it. It was Sean'snway of slowly killing us both. He may be dead himself now, but we'renstill gonna die a lot sooner than we normally would, thanks to him.nAnd that's why he went with me to Quantico. Why we don't part.nAnd it's also why I 'mother' him, as you put it.\" \"I'mnsorry about that. I didn't know. You just obviously care about himndeeply. Otherwise he'd have been long gone by now. I mean, you'dnhave to, knowing that he's going to slowly kill you over time. I'mnsorry, I didn't mean to put it like that. I guess it makes somensense. I still find this a bit hard to believe. But what aboutnthoseâ€¦.thoseâ€¦.teeth? He doesn't have them all the time, doesnhe? And what about daylight? Isn't that supposed to kill vampires?\" \"No.nIt's only when he goes hungry for a long time that his teeth grownback. Usually I use a syringe and fill a cup for him. Then, since hendoesn't need the teeth they recede back into his gums.\" \"Oh.\" \"Andnas for the daylight, don't believe everything you see on TV and thenmovies. He's different than them, and I don't mean just cause henonly needs my blood. Those on TV aren't real. Jacob is. If he couldndie from the light he could accidentally kill himself and I'd stillnbe alive, destroying Trelawney's plans for our deaths.\" âœ  Afterneverything had been explained and Walter decided to leave, to digestnall this weird information back home, Angela got off the couch andnwent back to her bedroom, to check on Jacob. Quietly opening thendoor, she leaned against the doorframe and watched Jacob sleepingnsoundly in bed. She felt a sudden urge come out of nowhere to go wrapnher arms around him, hold him safe within her arms while he slept.nShe remembered him telling her to get some rest, and a wave ofntiredness fell over her, and filled her veins, as her body strugglednto make up for the blood she had just lost to him. But Walter'sncomment remained in her head as well. Jacob WAS killing her slowlynover time. Jacob was right, she'd have a normal full life withoutnhim killing her with his need for her blood. He was killing her. Andntoday, he'd had his first experience sucking blood right from hernbody. Who knew what would happen if she did decide to sleep with him.nSometime in the night he could get hungry and she'd never wake upnin the morning. But then, he was killing her anyway. She was going tondie soon when she eventually ran out of her precious blood. Ifnanything happened in the night, it would only speed up what was toncome. She would put her trust in him again, trusting that she'dnwake up in the morning to a hungry Jacob patiently waiting for hisncup. She closed the door quietly behind her and went over to the bed,nlightly climbing over him to the other side. She wrapped her armsnaround his bone thin body, holding him close and safe. Howncould you do that to me? You scared me to death! I need you in mynlife, more than you think I do. After all we've been through Incan't live without you. Please, don't do that ever again, please!nShe begged silently as more tears spilled down her cheeks. Please![Chapter 13] The Net: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 13 Angela moaned and rolled over, her senses slowly coming to from her night's deep sleep. When she was fully awake, she realized that Jacob was too. He was still weak, but he turned over to face her as best as he could. \"Angel, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I didn't mean to hurt you. I only thought it would be better that way. I thought well, they expected us both to die, but that way, at least one of us could make it, and then we could finally say we beat the Praetorians. And at least one of us would go on to lead a full life. We both know I can't. But there's a chance for you. I'm really sorry. Really. You know, I woke up in the night, and couldn't go back to sleep cause what I did just wouldn't leave my mind. I never dreamed I'd end up hurting you by doing that. Angel, I'm sorry, and I promise I won't do that again, OK? I promise.\" \"It's OK. I probably would have done the same if I were in your shoes.\" \"Yeah, and I wouldn't have let youâ€¦..\" Jacob sighed. \"I guess I should have thought of that.\" \"Stop worrying over it. It's over. You're back here where you belong. Now look, why don't I go get breakfast for both of us as well as the TV and I'll come back here and we can spend the day watching TV in bed all day? Sound like fun?\" \"Yeah, sounds good. Don't know what else I'd do otherwise.\" Angela got up and went to the kitchen. As she was cooking eggs for herself, and drawing blood from the arm that wasn't bandaged, the phone rang. Pulling the full syringe out of her arm, she picked it up. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, Angela, it's me, Walter.\" \"Walter? What's up?\" \"I was praying you'd be up. I've got some great news for you!\" \"Um, OK, what?\" \"After we talked yesterday, I did some thinking. And I know this doctor, he believes in Big Foot too, in case you're wondering. Well, I talked to him last night. And he said he could help.\" \"Help? What do you mean?\" \"He might be able to change Jacob's genes back again. You know, back to a normal human, instead of a vampire.\" There was a long silence on her end. \"Angela?\" \"Are you serious! Can he really do that!\" \"He thinks so. Of course, there is no guarantee. Either he'll be back to normal or he'll remain the way he is now.\" \"When can he do this?\" \"Whenever Jacob's well again. Whenever he can make it in. There's just one catch.\" \"What's that?\" \"Well, besides there being no guarantee, you can't go with him. You both need to stay as far apart as possible.\" \"Oh. How long will this take? Do you know?\" \"Well there's no guarantee there either. Maybe a week, possibly two. Hopefully no more than that.\" \"OK, wow, this is just amazing! Well, let me talk to Jacob, see what he thinks of all this.\" \"Sure.\" âœ  When Angela got back to Jacob, all she carried with her was the cup of blood. \"What happened to your breakfast?\" Jacob asked. \"I was talking on the phone to Walter, and I wasn't paying attention to it, and well, the eggs burned.\" \"Oh. That's too bad. The poor eggs! Being burned like that!\" And there it was, as Angela handed him the mug, she heard it, the hint of his old self showing through the curtain of sadness that had draped itself over the both of them. And now, having his old self back for good might become a reality. When the mug was clean he looked up at her. She had a weird look on her face. \"What? What's wrong?\" \"Jacob, you're, you're, I can't explain it. But, you haven't made a comment like that sinceâ€¦.sinceâ€¦well, since before Sean made you this way.\" \"Yeah, so? What about it? What are you getting at?\" \"Walter called this morning to say that he knew a doctor that might be able to make you normal again.\" \"WHAT! Are you serious!\" \"I am.\" \"Tell me about this!\" \"Well, it could take a week, maybe two. I can't go with you. And, it might not work. You might come back still needing blood.\" \"I'll take that chance. When do I go?\" \"When you're well again, if you want. No sooner than that, but any time after.\" \"OK, I'm all for it!\" \"Alright. I'll go call him back now, and then try to make my breakfast again. Maybe I'll just have a bagel or something.\" âœ  The following week Angela stood in front of her apartment facing Jacob. She reached out and pulled him into a tight embrace. \"I'm gonna miss you,\" she said. \"I'll miss you too.\" \"Just promise me you'll come back to me. Human or vampire, I don't care. I just want you to come back. OK? Will you promise me that?\" \"Of course.\" \"And if you need ANYTHING, you call me. OK?\" \"Yeah, OK.\" When they finally pulled apart Jacob took his class ring off and put it back on Angela's hand. \"Jacobâ€¦.\" \"Just hold onto it for me, until I come back.\" \"Alright.\" Jacob got into his Intrepid with its new window and Angela watched him drive away before she left for work. âœ  \"You've been very quiet lately, I've noticed,\" Walter casually mentioned a few days later. \"Since Jacob's not here, I figured you'd be worried or something.\" \"You just thought I'd be wondering out loud how he's doing over and over again, right?\" \"Well, yeah, I supposeâ€¦..\" \"I am worried about him. I wonder every second, if this is gonna work, and if he's gonna be OK. I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut, so I don't bother others like you. I'm keeping my worrying and hoping to myself.\" \"Oh, I see.\" \"God, I wonder, what's going to happen to him. Is he going to be OK? Will this work?\" She saw Walter giving her a look. \"Yeah, I know. I justâ€¦I guess I can't keep it in for too long. Oh, this HAS to work! It just has to!\" âœ  Two weeks later, Angela sat at her desk typing a report on her latest case when suddenly she felt arms encircling her. Someone leaned around and kissed her full on the lips. She was so surprised and shocked she stood up and whirled around to attack. When she saw who it was she quickly changed modes and literally bear hugged him. \"Jacob! You're back!\" She let him go and looked him over. He wasn't thin or boney at all, and he hadn't had her blood in two whole weeks! \"Thanks to that guy, I'm back to normal now! On Monday I had spaghetti for dinner. Tuesday I had French toast for breakfast, tacos for lunch, and turkey and potatoes for dinner. Wednesday I had pancakes, ham and cheese sandwich, and fried chicken. Thursday I had cereal, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a salad, and macaroni and cheese! And that was only last week!\" \"Oh my God! You look so great! This is so awesome!\" \"Wanna celebrate?\" \"Celebrate? Jacob, I think we'll be celebrating our whole lives!\" He threw an arm around her shoulders. \"I talked to Walter and he's giving you the day off so we can spend it together however we want!\" \"Then what are we waiting for!\" ","Summary":" The Net: \"The Need For Blood\": Chapter 1 A/N: This is an edited version of the previous story, th"},{"Movie":"Net","Title":"Nightmare On The Highway","Author":"QueenOfTheUniverse","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1353711","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ThenNet: Nightmare On The Highway: Chapter 1 Jacobnleft the University of Washington's library ahead of hisnclassmates. He looked at his watch and hurried over to his car. \"Goingnto Angela's for dinner?\" one of his friends asked. \"Yeah,nactually I am,\" he replied. \"You'renso lucky man. What did you tell her to make her want to cook fornyou?\" someone else asked. \"Injust told her the truth: that we'd be working late on a project fornclass and that by the time we would be finished the dinning hallnwould be closed. She offered to make me dinner. That's all. Now, Inreally need to get going. I have to be there by eight-fifteen, andnit's eight now. So, I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" \"Yeahnsure, see ya!\" Jacobngot into his car and sped out of the parking lot. He drove down thenfamiliar back roads to Angela's apartment, excited about havingndinner with her, when he saw an orange barrier in the road up ahead.nHe slowed to a stop and saw a huge hole in the road on the other sidenof the barrier. Jacob sighed heavily and looked at the clock. It readneight-ten. Sighing again, he slowly turned his car around and headednback the way he had come. He'd have to take the long way now. Backnout on the highway, he drove for awhile as he watched the sun sinknlower and lower until it was pitch black out. He was forced to turnnon his headlights as he continued on. He searched for the right exitnbut couldn't find any at all. Jacob kept on driving, growing morenand more worried by the minute. Picking up his cell phone, he dialednAngela's number. There was no ringing sound at all when he put thenphone to his ear, only static. He hung up and looked at the clocknagain. Eight-ten. His watch said the same thing and the second handnwasn't moving. MaybenI should turn around, he thought. But if I do, I'll run intonthat road block again and there's no getting around that thing. Andnon top of that, I don't know any other way to Angel's other thannthese two. I guess the only thing I can do is keep going the way Inam. So,nhe kept driving, seeing no exits, no buildings, no people, no roadnsigns, no nothing at all, just highway stretching out in front and innback of him as far as the eye could see. There was no other cars onnthe road either. He tried calling Angela's again, but still, therenwas only static. On the road, there wasn't a single exit, nonhouses, no people, no signs. No signs of life. Turning on the radionand wishing desperately to be able to see Angela soon, he got onlynstatic there too and turned it off. Both his watch and the clock innhis car still read eight-ten, even though it seemed like he'd beennon the road forever. It seemed like this was taking way too long tonget to Angela's, even by highway instead of his usual shortcut. Allnof a sudden there was a man standing in the road in front of him.nJacob swerved to miss the guy but his tail end knocked him to thenground. The front right tire tipped off the road and then the wholencar went with it, rolling over and over down the hill until it hit antree. Jacob sat there for awhile, resting his head on the side of thencar. He could feel blood running down his face as he opened his eyesnand blinked. He looked around and realized that his car was on itsnside and he couldn't get out. ThanknGod I wore my seatbelt, I think it just saved my life. But what aboutnthe other guy? I hope he's alright. I didn't see him standingnthere. He's the first person I've seen on this road too. I wondernwhat he was doing out there in the middle of the road anyway? I can'tneven call for help or see if he's ok. No one would hear me throughnthis glass even though it's busted in several places. God, what amnI going to do? No one's going to find us out here in a millionnyears. And Angel's going to get worried. à¾­Hensighed heavily. If only I could see her again, that would be thenbest thing in the world![Chapter 2] ThenNet: Nightmare On The Highway: Chapter 2 Jacobnwaited and waited for what seemed like forever. He sat in onenposition, trapped in his car by the seatbelt which had saved hisnlife. The belt was now jammed between the door and his seat. All hendid was breath. He had even ceased to think by then. Anlong time passed by until he finally heard sirens coming his way.nThey stopped somewhere nearby and he just barely heard a woman'snvoice screaming something he couldn't understand. Seconds later hensaw several people running towards the car. He watched them,nhelplessly, as they sized up the situation. One of them ran back tontheir vehicle, and soon returned carrying some sort of machinery.nJacob then watched in horror as the guy began to saw through part ofnthe door to his car. They pried the rest of the door off with a crownbar. \"Arenyou alright?\" someone asked when the door was finally off and theynwere able to get to him. \"Inthink so. But what about the man I hit? The guy in the road?\" \"There'snno one out there anywhere or we would have seen them. Come on, let'snget you out of here to a hospital. You've had a pretty bad accidentnhere.\" Carefully,nthey lifted him out of the totaled car and onto a stretcher. Meanwhile,nAngela paced the kitchen floor of her apartment, nervously, as shenheld the phone to her ear. \"Walter, look, it's almost elevennthirty and he was supposed to be here over three hours ago! I triedncalling his dorm but no one answers the phone. He hasn't called ornanything. I tried his cell phone too, but no one answers thereneither. What on earth could have happened to him!\" \"I'mnsure he's probably just out partying with friends or something.\" \"No.nHe would have called. And besides, he was looking forward to dinnernhere tonight.\" \"Well,nthen, I don't know what to say.\" \"God,nWalter, I mean, anything could have happened to him. Anything atnall.\" \"Indon't know what to tell you.\" \"Walter,nyou said that already.\" Suddenly there was a beep through thenphone. \"Oh, I've got a call coming in. I'll call you back,\"nAngela said, hanging up with her boss to take the other call.n\"Hello?\" \"Hi,nis this Angela Bennett?\" \"Yes,nit is.\" \"Hi,nthis is the Fletcher Memorial Hospital calling to tell you that wenhave a Jacob Resh here. He needs you to come pick him up.\" \"What!nWhat happened to him! Is he alright!\" \"He'snfine. He was in a car accident but he only ended up with a fewnscrapes.\" \"Oh,nthank God! I'll be right there.\" Angelanhung up, grabbed her keys, cell phone, and jacket as she ran out thendoor to her car. Once on the road, she called Walter and told him thennews. Finally arriving at the hospital awhile later, she didn'tneven bother to lock the car door, as she ran into the hospital. Annurse showed her the room where Jacob was waiting for her. She ran tonhim and threw her arms around him in a thankful he was alive embrace. \"Angel!nBoy am I glad to see you!\" he exclaimed. \"AndnI'm extremely glad to see you too! Extremely glad to see you alivenand OK! You have no idea how worried I was about you when you nevernshowed up!\" Jacob smiled briefly. \"Well come on, let's get younhome, so we can finally have dinner, and you can tell me whatnhappened along the way.\" Afternpaying the hospital, they got into Angela's car, and began the longndrive back to her place. Along the way, Jacob told her what hadnhappened. \"Ohnmy God. Jacob, I justâ€¦..I can't believe he just disappeared likenthat. That no one saw him after you did.\" \"Yeah,nI must not have hit him at all like I thought I did. And then he mustnhave just left as soon as possible.\" \"Indon't believe he didn't stop and help or even call for helpnbefore he left.\" \"Yeah,nI'm just glad that woman came by and was able to get help. Yeah shendidn't have a cell phone or anything, but she did go get someone,nsupposedly, anyway. That's what the hospital people told me.\" \"Injust don't get one thing. You said all the road signs were gone?nBecause I know I'm seeing them now.\" \"Inknow. I don't get it either. But they were gone. I swear as sure asnI'm sitting here!\" \"Well,nI don't care whether they were there or not, I want you to stay atnmy apartment tonight. You can have the pullout couch.\" \"Alright.\" Angelanturned off the main road onto a dark and very twisty back road. \"Angel,nremember this is the road I told you about withâ€¦\" Rounding ancorner, they came upon the road block. \"...that barrier,\" Jacobnfinished. Thenonly difference this time, was a man standing in front of it wavingnhis arms to get them to stop. Blood covered his face and body. \"Ohnmy god! That's the guy I almost hit!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Inmust have hit him cause he didn't have all that blood before!\" Angelanbraked the car to a quick stop. \"Jacob,nyou didn't get a good look at him before did you?\" Thenman started to stumble towards the car. \"No.\" \"Looknnow.\" \"HOLYnSHIT! That's Sean Trelawney!...butâ€¦butâ€¦.I thought henwasâ€¦.he was dead!\"[Chapter 3] ThenNet: \"Nightmare On The Highway\" part 3 Angelanthrew the car into reverse and they sped backwards away from Seannuntil she could turn around. Then they headed out onto the highway.nAngela was doing ninety miles an hour out of sheer terror,nremembering that bright sunny day on the FBI training field whennshe'd seen her enemy shot to death by Walter. She'd watched Seannleave this life, herself. She was sure he was dead. But yet, therenhe'd been at that road block. \"Whatntime is it?\" she asked. Jacobnlooked at his watch. It still read 8:10pm . Her clock read 11:45 .n\"It's 11:45 ,\" he said. \"Oh.\" Shenlooked in her rearview mirror and saw someone coming up close inntheir car, now that they were out on the highway. She was still doingnninety. No one else would be doing the same unless they were out tonget her and Jacob. But who would do that besides Sean? Angelanscreamed and stepped on the gas peddle. Jacob watched the speedometernneedle slowly pass one hundred and then one hundred ten. \"Angel?\" \"Sean'snbehind us!\" she exclaimed. Henturned in his seatbelt to see bright headlights trying to keep upnwith them. He faced forward again and watched as the signs along thenroad began to disappear again. There were no exit ramps or sidenroads. à¾­Itnwas just as it had been before. \"Jacob!\"nAngela's voice was terrified. \"Yeah?\" \"Tellnme you see road signs and things!\" \"Indon't,\" he said truthfully, as he put a hand on her arm in annattempt to calm her down a little. His attempt failed as Sean drewneven closer. She pressed further down on the gas. Fornseveral miles Sean stayed a foot or so behind Angela and Jacob. Butnthen everything changed when her car suddenly jolted forward. \"He'snhitting my bumper!\" Jacob grabbed hold of the door handle and thenseat he was in. Trelawney rammed into her car again. \"Jacob, myncell phone's in the glove box. Call Walter!\" Jacobnreached for the phone as the car lurched forward again. He was thrownnback against the seat, but he had the cell phone in his hand. Hendialed her boss's phone number. It rang on the other endâ€¦..and itnrangâ€¦..and it rang. Then it went to static. He hung up and triednagain, but it was only static. The phone was dead the same as his. \"Itnwon't work.\" \"Oh!nGod, we're gonna die! We are gonna die!\" \"Angel,ndon't say that! Look at what we've been through already!\" \"Yeah,nbut Sean's supposed to be dead! I watched him die myself!\" \"It'snjust a dream! One of us has to wake up! That's all this is!\" \"Nonit's not Jacob!\" \"Hownwould you know!\" Sean'sncar rammed into theirs harder than ever before. Angela's handnslipped off the steering wheel and hit a jagged edge on the stereonthat had gotten scraped accidentally a few days before by a sharpnobject. Her breath caught in her throat for a second. \"Arenyou OK?\" Jacob asked. Shenpulled her arm up, and saw blood trickling down her arm. Grabbingnonto the steering wheel, she pressed the car to go faster. \"Thisnis how I know this isn't a dream! God, that hurts! Owwwww!\"[Chapter 4] ThenNet: Nightmare On The Highway: Chapter 4 Grittingnher teeth to keep her mind off the pain in her hand, she grabbed thensteering wheel with both hands and continued down the highway at anbreakneck speed. The pain slowly lessened, but Sean's hitting hernbumper surely did not. Angela and Jacob were jerked forward smorentimes than they could possibly count. A newnsound suddenly rent through that of her engine pushing itself to thenlimits. There was a loud bang and a bullet came whizzing through hernback window! It sped between them and right out the windshield,ncausing it to crack all over the place. \"Jacob,nI can't see where we're going!\" Jacobnducked in his seat so that he could look through a portion of thenglass that didn't have any cracks. \"Justnkeep going straight! You're doing fine! OK, turn ahead! Turnnslightly to the right!\" Jacobngave her directions and she followed through, keeping them on thenroad. Though mostly, the road was straight, there were, on rarenoccasions, slight turns. Even through those turns, Sean managed tonkeep up with them and to keep hitting her bumper. One particularntime, he rammed into them pretty hard; harder than usual. Angela andnJacob both lurched forward, but whereas Jacob had nothing immediatelynin front of him save his seatbelt, Angela was thrown into thensteering wheel. She let out a scream of pain. Jacob jerked his headnto look worriedly at her. \"I'mnOK, I'm OK,\" she breathed, sitting up straighter and pushing thengas pedal all the way to the floor, making them go even faster. Jacobnwas thrown back in his seat from the force of their speeding, thoughnhe still managed to direct her which way to go. Another shot rangnout, and this time the whole back window was gone when Jacob chancedna look. The bullet buried itself into the back of Jacob's seat. Henadvised Angela to stay low in her seat so Sean Trelawney couldn'tnsee them very well. \"Wherenis this road taking us!\" Jacob asked out loud. \"Indon't know, but wherever it is, it had better be better than wherenwe are now!\" Thencar lurched forward again, and this time there was another strangensound accompanying the one of her car being rear-ended constantly.nShe looked in the rearview mirror and saw to her horror that thenwhole back end of her vehicle had been smashed in! There was a hugendent the size of both her and Jacob's bodies put togethernunderneath what used to be the back window. Angela's face wasnalready white and Jacob's was growing paler by the second. \"Ohnmy God! Jacob we're running out of gas! I forgot to fill itnafter work today! We're almost empty!\" \"SHIT!\"nthe teen shouted. He looked back quickly, to see that Sean wasn'tngoing to be losing them anytime soon. He looked through the glassnagain. \"I see something!\" he shouted in excitement.n\"Something's up ahead!\" \"Hownfar!\" \"Maybe,nwell, I'm not sure. All I can see is a faint light. Maybe a mile orntwo.\" \"Indon't know if I can make it!\" \"TrynAngel! Just try! That's all we can hope for!\" A/N:nThanks for all of the reviews so far! You guys are awesome![Chapter 5] ThenNet: Nightmare On The Highway: Chapter 5 Whilenwilling the car to go forward, Jacob chanced a look at Angela'sndashboard clock. He realized then, that it's time, 11:45,couldn'tnpossibly be correct. He'd remembered giving her that same time anlong while ago. He shuddered and looked behind him. Miraculously,nSean Trelawney was several car lengths behind them, and they seemednto be slowing down! \"Inthink he's slowing down!\" Jacob exclaimed. Angelanbreathed a huge sigh of relief. \"Of course,\" she said, her voicena bit shaky, \"that doesn't mean he'll stop chasing us!\" \"How'renwe doing? The gas holding out OK?\" \"Barely.\" Jacobnfaced forward again and watched as the tiny light he'd seen begannto get bigger and bigger the closer they came to it. His eyes widenednat the sight for it turned out to be nothing other than a small motelnwith a single gas pump out front. Angela slowly eased her car intonthe parking lot. It was almost empty. \"OK,nhere's the plan. Angel, you fill the tank, I'll go in and see ifnI can call Walter. If anything happens out here, give me a shout, K?\" \"Yeah,nsure.\" Jacobnran into the front desk of the motel. There was an older man there,npossibly in his late fifties, early sixties. He had short hair, oncenblack, but now turning grey. He put down the newspaper he was readingnwhen Jacob came in. \"Whatncan I do for you? You'd like a room?\" \"Isnthat a real working gas pump out there!\" he asked, nearly out ofnbreath. \"YupnGot a real working pool out back too if you want.\" \"CannI borrow your phone for a second? This is an emergency!\" \"I'mnsorry. But my phone's dead. Been dead for about a week now. Don'tnknow when it's gonna come back either. You wanna room?\" \"Iâ€¦No.nHere.\" Jacob dug deep into his pockets and pulled out a twenty andnhanded it to the guy. \"For gas.\" Goingnback outside, he found Angela just finishing up with the pump. \"Indon't see Sean anywhere. Any luck with Walter?\" \"No.nPhone's dead.\" \"Great.nWell, you think we should risk getting a room? Perhaps let this wholenthing blow over and see what happens in the morning?\" \"Well,nI don't see what else we really can do except keep driving, thoughnwhere this road is taking us, I haven't the foggiest clue.\" \"OK,nI'll go park this around back, hopefully, Sean won't see it backnthere.\" \"I'llnget the room then. Meet you out front.\" A fewnshort minutes later they found themselves standing in the doorway ofna room in the back. There was only one bed. Angela sighed. \"Inguess we'll just have to make due. Let's get in here beforensomeone sees us!\" Thendoor was shut behind them and bolted to the hilt with all of thenavailable locks. Angela collapsed on the bed. Jacob joined her. \"God,nwhat are we gonna do?\" she asked. \"How on earth are we supposednto outwit him or kill him? I mean, isn't he supposed to already bendead?\" she asked. \"Inonly wish I had answers for you. But I don't. I don't havenanything.\" \"Inwanna go to sleep. But I don't know if I should.\" \"I'llnstay awake and keep watch. I'll let ya know if anything shouldnhappen.\" \"Butnwhat about you? You need sleep too.\" \"I'llnwake you up in a few hours, then you keep watch and I'll sleep.nSound good?\" \"Yeahâ€¦..yeahâ€¦.itâ€¦..doesâ€¦..\"nAngela had closed her eyes while they talked, and she was alreadynmumbling on her way to sleep. Meanwhile,nJacob amused himself by playing games on the pad of paper on thennight stand, playing X's and 0's among others. After awhile, henpicked up the phone to test it himself, and got nothing. There wasn'tna single sound at all, not even the dial tone. He lazily put it backnand started doodling on the paper again.[Chapter 6] ThenNet: \"Nightmare On The Highway\" part 6 Suddenlynthe thought occurred to Jacob to look at the alarm clock to check thentime. He found it blinking 12:00 . \"Damn,\" he said under hisnbreath as he sat back against the headboard next to Angela'snsleeping form. He stared at the TV for a long time. How long, hendidn't know. Angela moaned and rolled over in her sleep taking himnout of his trance-like state as she threw an arm around him. Jacobnshook his head and looked down at her. She was still sound asleep,nand had no idea that she was practically hugging him. Watching her,nhe found himself putting an arm around her. Itnwas a typical ultra cheap hotel room. One small TV with no remote,nwhich probably didn't work anyway, sat on the dresser. The dressernitself was covered in peoples initials and anything else they couldnscratch into the surface. Next to the dresser was an old beat up andnbadly bent metal folding chair. Only God knew what that had been usednfor in a place like this. Beside the bed, there was a likewise beatnup and scratched night table, with nothing but a lamp and a clocknthat couldn't tell the time. The bed itself wasn't in great shapeneither. The sheets and the comforter needed to be cleaned, badly, andnthe headboard and footboard, both resembled the night stand and thendresser in all the carvings they sported. Neithernhe nor Angela had been in the bathroom to see what that was like, andnhe wasn't sure he even wanted to know. Jacobndecided to keep himself both awake and busy by reading what he couldnof the carvings. Most of which consisted of initials surrounded bynhearts and plus signs. He sighed heavily. Not knowing what time itnwas, was really starting to get annoying. Never before had thisnbothered him. He'd gone hours without knowing before, but then,nhe'd had the info handy incase he ever did need to know. Now, hencouldn't have it, and that was getting to him. Angelanwoke up with a start just then. He took his arm from around her asnshe sat up. \"YounOK?\" Jacob asked. \"Yeah,nhas anything happened?\" \"Nope.nNot a thing.\" \"Donwe know the time yet?\" she asked as she struggled to wipe the sleepnfrom her eyes. \"Inwish.\" \"Mmmmmmmâ€¦.well,nI guess you should try to get some sleep then. I'll keep watch.\" \"Yeah,nright.\" Jacobnslid down so that his head was resting on the pillow he'd recentlynbeen sitting on when there was a weird noise at the door. \"Whatnwas that?\" Angela asked. \"Indon't know.\" He sat up again. \"It sounded like somethingnscratching the door. Probably just an animal out there, like ansquirrel or something.\" Theynboth stared at the door for awhile before Jacob slid back down again,nintent on getting some shut eye. \"Justnan animal like I said. It's gone already.\" Butnthen the odd scratching noise started up again, and this time itndidn't stop. Jacob bolted upright. He and Angela looked at eachnother. He watched Angela slowly get off the bed and tip-toe over tonthe door. She put her eye up to the peep hole to see what couldnpossibly be on the other side scratching at the door.[Chapter 7] ThenNet: \"Nightmare On The Highway\" part 7 A/N:nDon't forget to R+R too! Constructive comments are always welcome!nProof that fans of my work are out there, is always a wonderfulnthing...enjoy! -IW \"Wellâ€¦.whatnis it?\" Jacob asked, almost afraid to hear the answer. WhennAngela turned back to him, her face was covered in a look of terror.nHer eyes were wide open and she stood there, staring at him,nseemingly trying to scream, though no sound came out. She wasnbreathing heavily. \"Angel,nare you OK?\" he whispered. \"Who was it?...It wasn't Sean,nwas it?\" he finally asked when she didn't respond to any of hisnearlier questions. Allnshe could do was nod. \"OhnGod. Um, what are we going to do?\" he asked out loud as he lookednwildly around the room. His eyes fell on the old chair. Picking itnup, he ran to the door. \"Angel, I want you to open the door, andnquickly get out of the way. OK?\" Shennodded, and on his say so, she threw open the door, and stepped outnof his way. He ran through, wielding the chair. He felt it come intoncontact with something hard, and saw Sean Trelawney fall to thenground out of the corner of his eye. Throwing the chair onto hisnprone body, Jacob ran towards the car, with Angela running closenbehind. \"Givenme the keys!\" he called as he was closer to the driver's side.nShe tossed them to him and they both got in. Speedingnaway, Jacob looked into the rearview mirror to make sure Sean wasnstill on the ground in front of their hotel door. The ground,nhowever, was empty of his body. Jacob shivered and looked forward tonthe highway ahead of them as he pulled out of the parking lot. \"What'snwrong?\" Angela asked. \"Sean'sngone already.\" Angelanlooked back to confirm what he'd said and screamed. Jacob peeredninto the rearview once again and froze, his foot on the gas and hisneyes on the mirror, on the bloody man in the back seat.[Chapter 8] ThenNet: Nightmare on the Highway: Chapter 8 Jacob'sneyes grew wide and he turned in his seat to make sure the mirrornwasn't lying to him. As he turned, he saw a drop of blood fall tonthe shoulder of his seat, soaking into the fabric in an instant. Seanngrinned at him, and gave a little evil laugh. Blood ran in rivuletsndown the side of his face. Jacob breathed out slowly before turningnback to the road. With grim determination, and no warning, he spunnthe car around to face the other way. Angelanscreamed, though her seatbelt kept her in place as Trelawney wentnflying to the other side of the car. Sean's head cracked againstnthe side of the car but he recovered quickly. Sitting up, he reachednhis hands over Angela's head rest and looped his arms around hernneck, choking her. \"Jacob!\"nAngela managed to get out, feeling Sean's icy skin against hers. Jacob'snbreathing came faster matching his heart in a race against time. Whatnwould he do? What could he do? He wondered, shutting off the car'snengine. Sean grinned at him, and choked her harder while Angelansqueezed her fingers between his wrists and her neck. Jacob watchednher face turning red, before turning in his seat to face them withnhis whole body. Trelawney turned his eyes back on Angela and seemednto caress her body and undress her with his look alone. While he wasnpreoccupied, Jacob reached out with his right leg and stung Sean innhis side, knocking him into the backseat and forcing him to let go ofnAngela. WhilenSean was stunned Jacob climbed into the backseat with him and begannpummeling his icy body. Angela got into the driver's side andnwatched the fight. Trelawney managed to get in several good punchesnto Jacob's head while the young man attempted to unlock the door onnthe other side of his enemy. His head snapped backwards and Sean wasnable to climb over him and deliver many more punches to his torso.nJacob moaned and tried to get up, but Sean had him pinned. Angelangot out of the car, ran around to the trunk and pulled out a crownbar. Opening the back side door, she swung the crow bar high in thenair and let it come crashing down on Sean Trelawney's back. The mannlet out a loud scream and his body crumpled over Jacob. Angela threwnthe bar down, grabbed him by his ankles and hauled him out onto thenpavement. Wasting no time, she'd grabbed the crow bar again beforenhe had time to get up and come after her. She began waling his body,nwatching as large welts began to rise from his skin. Surprisingly,nit was Jacob who wrapped his arms around her from behind to keep hernfrom doing more damage. He ushered her back into the car. \"Comenon, let's get out of here. I think he's gone. I think it's allnover. Finally,\" he said, starting the car up again, turning itnaround and driving away. Angelanwas visibly shaking as road signs began appearing on the side of thenhighway once again. A large sign came into view up ahead and as theynneared it, they found a hotel, the parking lot filled with cars. \"Angel,ncalm down. It's OK. We beat him! It's over!\" \"Howncan you be so sure? I saw him get shot. I watched him die before mynvery own eyes, yet he came back!\" \"It'llnbe fine. Trust me. Now look, let's just get a room for the rest ofnthe night and forget everything that just happened.\" Jacobnparked the car and they got out. \"Andnwhat about Walter? Do you even know where the hell we are? What willnWalter say when I'm late for work? And don't you have class innthe morning?\" \"No,nmy morning class is Thursdays. Tomorrow's only Tuesday. And younknow we can call Walter and just explain that we went on a littlenroad trip and you might be a little late, that's all. I'm surenhe'll understand.\" Angelangave a sarcastic laugh. \"No he won't. This is not just somenlittle road trip. It won't fly. Not with him. He's in the FBI!\" \"Yeahnand so are you. Look, don't worry about it. We're getting a room.nWe'll just spend the night relaxing. Forget what happened, get somensleep. And we can head back tomorrow. It'll all be like nothingnever happened.\" \"Riiight.\" WhennJacob approached the counter to reserve a room for the night the mannin the maroon suit looked at him with a surprised look on his face,nbefore bringing his hand up to his own face and gently touching it,nas if something was there that couldn't be touched roughly. Jacobnremembered the fight in the car and shook his head. \"Don'tnworry. It's nothing. I'm fine. I just need a room for the night.\" \"Yeah,nsure,\" the man said, still distracted by Jacob's face. Flippingnthe lights on in their new hotel room, Angela was able to see Jacob'snface in a clear light. Her breath caught in her throat and shenstifled a cry before pushing him into a chair and ripping her pursenopen. She pulled out several band-aids and some Neosporin and kneeledndown in front of him. Hisnface was covered in bruises, some of which had swollen and some hadnbroken open. Squeezing some of the ointment onto her fingers, shengently spread it onto his wounds. He jerked back, surprised at thenpain. \"Ow!\" \"I'mnsorry!\" \"No,nit's not you. Damn! That hurts!\" Shenfinished applying the Neosporin and taped him up with band-aids. Whennshe was done Jacob stood up to look at himself in the mirror andnsighed when he saw his face covered in band-aids and bruises. \"Whatnif he comes back?\" \"Angel,nwe're here to forget everything.\" Jacobnwent over to the bed where she was sitting and pulled her up besidenhim, his arm around her. \"Justnforget it all. Forget everything that's ever happened. You are annamazing, no, the best, most amazing, computer programer in the world!nYou're known as Angela Marie Bennett and no one has ever known younas anything else. You and I met on a singles cruise last year, andnever since then, we've been hitting it off really well...\" \"Jacob!\" \"What?nI was just trying to paint a grand picture. You mean that wasn'tngrand enough? Well, then, let's see...\"[Chapter 9] ThenNet: Nightmare On The Highway: Chapter 9 A/N:nI know people are reading this, but there are no new reviews orncomments. I'd really like to know how I'm doing! It would mean anlot to me to get a comment or suggestion or whatever. If I gotnsomething wrong, let me know that too! Thanks! And by the way, thisnnightmare is hardly over! \"Jacob...\" \"Yeah?\" Angelansnuggled closer to him and rested her head on his shoulder. \"Thanknyou.\" \"Fornwhat?\" \"Forneverything. For being Sorcerer and helping me through the Praetoriansnthe first time, for being you and just being here with me. No onenelse has ever stuck by me like you have. And...and I just don'tnknow what I would have ever done without you.\" Jacobntook her chin in his hand and turned her head to face him. \"Angel,nwhen I first met you I had this feeling in me that something wasngoing to happen. I don't know what but I couldn't leave you. Itnwas like there was glue between us. And after the Praetorians wentndown, that glue was still there. And I can sense that whatever wasngoing to happen still hasn't happened yet. And it's not that Incan't leave you. I just don't want to.\" \"Whatnare you saying Jacob?\"Angela asked, her face just an inch from his. \"I...\"nJacob stammered and looked back towards the old television set as hengulped down the wad of spit that had collected in his mouth. Henturned back towards her and said the words he'd been holding backnfor so long. \"Angel, I love you.\" Hernbreath caught in her throat as she stared into his beautiful blueneyes, great pools letting her into his soul. And she knew he wasntelling the truth. \"It'sntoo much to hope for,\" she whispered. \"Whatndo you mean?\" \"Inalways wanted you to. Right from the start. Even when I hated younwhen I found out who you really were. But I kept telling myself thatnit was too good to be true. Too good to hope for.\" \"Well,nit's true Angel. I do love you. And I would do anything for you.\" \"I'mnnot hearing this. Jacob, I love you. I love you. I love you. But thisnis just a dream. This whole thing is a nightmare. Just Trelawney'snplot to lure me out or something. But...\" Jacobnleaned in then and kissed her. Cradling her head in his hands hendidn't let go for a while. When he did Angela's head wasnspinning. \"It'sntrue. This is happening. This is real,\" she breathed. \"Sean isnback.\" \"Wasnback, hun. You killed him pretty good with that crow bar, remember?\" \"Butnhe was killed with a bullet once before and he managed to rise fromnthe grave after that. What makes you think he won't come back afternsome beating. We didn't even bury him this time.\" Jacobnkissed her gently on the lips. \"Don't worry. The nightmare isnover. Why don't we both just try to get some sleep. I'm sure thatnwill help. We're tired and we've been through a lot. That's notngoing to help our brains.\" \"I'mnnot sure I can sleep after everything that's happened tonight.\" \"Justnget comfortable. I'll turn on the TV for awhile and I'm sure itnwon't take long for you to fall asleep.\" \"Yeah,nOK, sure,\" Angela said, getting comfortable, leaning against Jacobnas he switched on the TV. Anyoung woman with shoulder length brown hair was on the TV sitting innfront of a tiny laptop, apparently having a conversation with someonenelse: \" Jacob,nthat can't be. Sean Trelawney knows where I am. All the time henmanages to find me. You've got to stay away. If he were to find younand figure out who you are...\" \" Angel,nit wouldn't matter either way. I'm here to help you and I'm notnbacking down from them!\" A young teenage voice came across thencomputer as his words came onto the screen. Innthe room, Angela turned to Jacob and they looked at each other withnquizzical expressions on their faces. Angela wrapped her arms aroundnhim and stared at the TV. Jacob didn't even try to change thenchannel, wondering what was going on. Onnthe TV Angela packed up her T46 laptop and left the small diner she'dnbeen in. Walking down the street, backpack slung over one shoulder,nshe was careful to look around her and keep an eye on hernsurroundings.[Chapter 10] ThenNet: Nightmare on the Highway: Chapter 10 Thenscene changed on the TV to reveal a dark, garbage filled ally way. Andark form was walking towards the camera crew and withing a fewnseconds the form was revealed to be a man. A man they both knew well.nSean stepped out of the shadows with an evil grin on his face. \"I'mngonna get you this time, Angela,\" he said to the camera. \"I'mngonna get you.\" Andnwhen he reached the lens, and was so close Angela and Jacob could seenthe fibers on his shirt and the pores on his face, he kept coming.nThey stared with wide eyes as his lifted a foot up and into thencamera. But the camera didn't stop him. His foot came through thenTV screen and into their hotel room. \"Jacob!nHe's not dead! I told you he wasn't dead!\" Angela shouted,ngripping Jacob as hard as she could without taking her eyes off thenTV. Twonhands came out next, holding onto the sides of the TV they pulled thenrest of Sean's body through. Jacobnwas shaking with a fear he'd never known before. Sean was no longernhuman. He just couldn't be. He was no longer easy to deal with, nonlonger a bumbling idiot of a Praetorian. Now, he was a bumbling idiotnwho could come back to life at will. Jacob tried to remain calm fornAngela's sake, but it didn't work. He knew Sean was after her,nand if he could come back to life like this, then he'd do anythingnto get her. SeannTrelawney grinned as he walked towards the couple on the bed. \"I'mnhere for you Angela,\" he said, pulling a gun out from behind hisnback and aiming it at her. \"Why don't you just come with me. Comenquietly and no one will get hurt.\" Angelanlooked briefly into Jacob's eyes as if to tell him how much shenloved him before slowly getting off the bed. \"No!\"nJacob jumped to his feet. \"No! Take me instead! Please. I will donanything for her. Take me, and leave her alone. You don't neednher.\" \"Jacob!\"nAngela turned to him, fear in her eyes. \"Ah,nsuch a noble cause.\" Sean looked from one to the other beforenmotioning Angela back onto the bed. \"You stay here, sweetheart. Onenmove after him, and he's a dead boy. Got it?\" Angelannodded furiously, pleading with her eyes to Jacob not to do this. Henshook his head and went to Trelawney's side. The Praetorian grabbednhis shoulder with one hand and with his gun in the other he suddenlynbegan to lift off the ground. Angela's mouth dropped open and Jacobnuttered a small cry of surprise when Sean pulled him upwards towardsnthe ceiling. The Praetorian's head disappeared and his neck andnshoulders. Jacob flinched as his own head neared the ceiling. But henwent straight through as if nothing was there. He came up into thenmotel room above theirs. The room was dark and the bed appearednempty. Sean kept floating upwards, taking Jacob with him. Goingnthrough the second ceiling Jacob found himself outside, on the roofnof the motel. \"Whatnare you going to do with me?\" Jacob asked when Sean came back downnto the roof once Jacob was through. \"Well...\"nSean was cut off by something catching the corner of his eye. Hengrabbed Jacob's shoulder again and pulled him to the edge of thenroof. Jacob looked down to the hard pavement where one car sat in thenparking lot and gulped. Trelawney pushed him over, while stillnholding onto his shirt. Jacob screamed for Trelawney to bring himnback up, but the Praetorian was hardly paying attention as Angelancame into view, panting from her sprint up the stairs. \"Intold you not to follow us or I'd have to kill him. Did you reallynwant to risk his life?\"[Chapter 11] ThenNet: Nightmare on the Highway: Chapter 11 A/N:nI now know how this story is going to end! Yay! And the ending isnnear.

Anyway, please do enjoy and letnme know what you think! Thanks! \"Angel!nThe remote!\" Jacob screamed when he saw it in her hand. Shenlooked down as if she hadn't remembered grabbing it. \"Usenit on him! He came from the TV, remember? Kill him with it, Angel!\" Sean'sneyes went wide for a second as he continued to hold Jacob over thenedge of the roof. Then he smiled. \"I'mnreally not sure you want to be doing that, Angela. One click fromnthat remote and I may be gone, yes, but what about the kid? Huh?nHe'll just fall to the ground down there.\" Seannleaned over the edge to see the ground far below. Jacob screamed asnSean moved, pushing him farther out from the roof. \"No!\"nAngela yelled. \"Please! Don't let him go!\" \"Pushnthat button sweetheart and I'll have no choice.\" \"Don'tncall her sweetheart,\" Jacob glowered at Trelawney. \"Angel, justndo it. He'll be gone. Out of your life. You'll be free from thenPraetorians. Free! Just push the button!\" Jacobnlooked from Angela to the ground far below, as Sean yanked him closernto the roof again. He screamed, waving his arms and legs aroundntrying to get a hold onto the edge of the gutter. Trelawney pushednhim back out again to prevent him from gaining the hold. Angela'sneyes went wide, staring at them, her hands motionless around thentelevision remote. Jacob'snface changed all of a sudden, the fear in his eyes gone, his mouthnset in a line. He looked at Angela, straight into her eyes. \"Angel.nI love you.\" \"Awww,nhow touching,\" Sean said, pulling Jacob back before pushing him outnagain. Thenyoung man's eyes went wide with fright again, for just a second,nbefore his features set again. \"Do it Angel. Just do it. There'snnothing else you can do. Push the button. I love you, Angel.\" Angela'snwide eyes went from Jacob to Trelawney and back again as she took anslow step backwards. \"Inlove you Jacob,\" she said and pushed the power button on thenremote. In anflash Sean Trelawney was gone and Jacob was falling. \"JACOB!\"nAngela screamed, running towards the edge of the building. Henthrew his body at the building and grabbed a hold of the gutter asnhis body fell towards the hard pavement below. The gutter cracked onnboth sides of him as it took his full weight and he fell several moreninches, clinging for his life. Not daring to look down, he looked upnnow, into the face of Angela, her brows furrowed in worry as shenreached out to grab his hand. Her hands were shaking and she wasnbreathing hard, saying \"Oh God, oh God...\" over and over again.[Chapter 12] ThenNet: Nightmare on the Highway: Chapter 12 Seeingndeep into her fear filled eyes, Jacob saw the woman he loved. Thenwoman who wouldn't let him fall to his death, no matter how scarednshe seemed on the outside. As the gutter cracked further he let gonwith his right hand and swung it upwards into her hard grasp. Withnbrute strength she pulled him back up onto the roof. Withoutneven stopping to catch her breath Angela threw her arms around Jacobnas soon as she knew he wouldn't fall. \"Ohnthank God you're alright. Thank God.\" Jacobnsaid nothing, just held her close, his eyes shut tight. A single tearnmade its way down his cheek. Anfull fifteen minutes later they got up and went back down to theirnroom. Angela gathered her purse and headed for the door. Thentelevision screen was black as Jacob straightened out the bed covers. \"We'llnjust get a different room for the night,\" he said. \"No.nI want out of this place. Now.\" \"Butnwhere will we go?\" \"Home.nLet's go home. We can sleep all day once we get there. I'll justncall Walter and tell him I need to take the day off. I just want tongo home.\" \"OK.nWe can go home.\" Togethernthey left for the parking lot and got into Angela's car. Drivingndown the deserted highway the hotel disappeared into the darknessnuntil their own headlights were all they could see in the darkness. \"Staynthe night,\" Angela said, breaking the silence. \"What?\" \"Inreally just don't want to be alone right now.\" \"Oh,nthat's so sweet, Angela,\" another voice spoke up. \"How come Innever got an invite like that?\" Theynboth turned in their seats to see Sean Trelawney in the back seatnagain. \"What?nHow?\" Jacob sputtered. \"Ah,nnow, now. That was just my TV image, children. This is the real me.\" Jacobnnoticed that Sean looked a little off from before. He seemed fainter,nas if, if he tried hard enough he would be able to see right throughnthe man. Angelanspun her head back around and kept her eyes on the road through thenmaze of cracks in the windshield. \"Now,nI'm going to do what I tried to do on the roof back there. Onlynthis time,\" he cocked a gun, \"I'm going to do it right.\" Henbrought the weapon into plain sight as he leveled it and aimed it atnJacob's head. The gun went off as Angela's hands left thensteering wheel. She leapt towards Jacob, pushing him forward, as thencar lurched off the road and the bullet lodged into her arm. The carnfell down a grassy incline and smashed into a tree at the bottom.nAngela was thrown back into her seat. Jacob's head came withinninches of hitting the windshield before he was slammed backwards.nWhen they'd caught their breath, they looked back to see Sean stillnsitting in the back seat, though his body seemed to be fading fromnexistence right before their eyes. Jacob began to see the back of thenseat the man was sitting on. \"Whatnthe...What's going on?\" he asked, bewildered by the disappearingnenemy who hadn't been hurt by gun shot or by the car smashing intonthe tree. \"Damnnit!\" Trelawney swore. \"That was my last chance to kill you both.nShit. I can't kill you. Aren't you lucky.\" Angelangripped her right arm in her left, trying hard to keep the flow ofnblood under control. \"What do you mean?\" \"You'llndo anything for each other. Damn it. You'll risk your lives forneach other. True Love. That's what it is. True love is preventingnme from killing you. Or anyone else from killing you for that matter.nOh, how I hate True Love!\"[Chapter 13] ThenNet: Nightmare on the Highway: Chapter 13 SeannTrelawney was looking paler by the second as more and more of thenback seat could be seen through his body. \"ThenDevil gave me one chance! One last chance to get you! And I failed.nCause you can't kill True Love. Guess it's back to the fireyngates of hell for me. After all, Saint Peter wouldn't take menbefore. He certainly won't take me now. Damn True Love! Damn it allnto hell.\" Therenwas a sudden, loud, pop and Sean Trelawney was gone. Thenwindshield shattered, raining broken glass on both of them. Jacobnclosed his eyes against the glass and when he opened them again,nAngela was staring at her arm. \"Mynarm feels tingly,\" she said. \"It didn't feel like this lastntime I was shot in the arm?\" \"Takenyour hand away, let me see how bad it is.\" Angelanmoved her hand to reveal the area where she'd been shot but Jacobncouldn't see a bullet wound. Only a massive bruise the size ofnChina remained along with the blood that had already poured forth andnstained both their skin and clothing. \"Whatnthe...what happened?\" Angelangot up the nerve to look at her arm and was taken aback by thenmissing bullet hole. Jacob,ntaking her arm gently in his hand, twisted it around a little to seenthe other side. Not even a scratch existed. \"Howndo you feel?\" he asked. \"Infeel fine. The tingling sensation just stopped.\" \"Weird.\" Jacobnsat back in his seat and sighed. \"I bet that's the same tree Inhit before too.\" Sirensnrent the air as several police cars and an ambulance arrived on thenscene. A familiar face appeared at Jacob's window. \"FBI!nWhat the hell they doin' callin' FBI in on a simple carnaccident?\" Jacob asked, smiling up at Walter as he rolled down hisnwindow. \"Whatnthe hell happened! You guys OK?\" Angela's boss asked, a worriednsound in his voice. \"Yeah,nyeah, we're fine,\" Angela said. \"We just ran off the road. Mynhand slipped. What are you doing here Walter?\" \"That'sna lot of blood for your hand to have slipped, Angela. What happened?\"nWalter opened Jacob's door and helped the college freshman out as anuniformed officer helped Angela. \"Intold you, Walter. My hand slipped and we ran off the road.\" \"Fornthree days?\" \"Whatndo you mean? It's Tuesday. By now.\" \"TrynFriday.\" \"What?\" \"Yountwo have been missing for three whole days!\" \"No.nBut. It was only one night. Jacob? Right?\" \"Yeah,none night. I know it was.\" \"Well,nI would certainly like to know exactly what happened to you two.nThree days missing and you show up 500 miles from home on anlittle-used highway closed for major renovations and repaving. Now Inwant some answers.\" Jacobnand Angela only stared at him, trying to comprehend the truth. \"Walter,\"nJacob began. \"You believe in Big Foot, right?\" \"What'snthat got to do with this? You didn't see him, did you?\" \"Younbelieve the Praetorians really did exist, right?\" Jacob asked as annEMT escorted him to a stretcher beside the ambulance to check himnover. Angela followed close behind with another EMT. \"Ofncourse.\" \"Donyou believe in heaven and hell?\" \"What'snthis all about?\" \"Younkilled Sean Trelawney, right?\" The EMT's had them both sit up onntwo stretchers before pulling out stethoscopes and blood pressurencuffs \"Yes,nI did! Now stop asking all these questions!\" \"Hencame back from the dead.\" \"What?\" \"Couldnyou just calm down for a second and breath deep for me,\" the EMTnasked, putting his stethoscope on Jacob's chest. Jacob turned fromnWalter and breathed as instructed until the EMT was done with thenstethoscope. \"ThenDevil granted him one last time to try and kill us both,\" Jacobnexplained. \"Ohnmy God. This is nuts. You need to seek some help. The accidentnscrewed up your brain somehow. Angela? How are you feeling?\" \"I'mnOK.\" \"Good.nI'm not sure I want to know what really happened beyond the factnthat you're both physically OK.\" Walternshook his head and went back to his car to wait for the EMTs tonfinish checking them over. \"Jacob?\"nAngela asked. \"Yeah?\" \"Movenin with me.\" \"What?nMove in?\" A grin spread across Jacob's face. \"That's the bestnthing I've heard in a long time, Angel. Besides the fact that Seanncouldn't kill us.\" \"Indon't mean just move in. Move in, and marry me.\" Jacob'sneyes went wide as he studied the seriousness on her face and the hintnof worry in the way she held her hands so tight they were turningnwhite. Ignoring the EMT administering a blood pressure cuff to hisnarm he got off the stretcher he'd been sitting on and rushed overnto Angela, throwing his arms around her. \"Ohnmy God, Angel, I love you. This is the moment I couldn't miss!\" \"Isnthat a 'yes'?\" Takingnher head between his hands Jacob leaned in and kissed her. \"Yes,\"nhe breathed when he let her go. Shengrinned. \"Um,nI hate to interrupt,\" an EMT said, \"But we still need to finishnchecking you over.\" \"We'renfine,\" Jacob said. \"But...\" \"We'renfine,\" he said again, taking Angela's hand and pulling her offnthe stretcher. Henlooked up at the sky and spread his arms upwards. \"Because SeannTrelawney can't kill True Love!\" he shouted for the whole worldnto hear.

It was raining hard,rnheavy drops splattering against the windows of the bus as it plowedrnahead. Inside the vehicle, a thin pale man in a shabby coat watchedrnwith disinterest as the world passed him by. The driver was keepingrnan eye on him via the rearview mirror; he sensed the stranger to bernthe troublemaking type. The traveler had not yet spoken a word duringrnthe entire lengthy trip, but other passengers seemed to pick up thernsame vibe about him and kept at a distance from the brooding fellow,rnleaving him to gaze at the empty night streets undisturbed. The tires ground to arnhalt against the pavement and the bus doors groaned in protest beforernthey resigned themselves to flapping wetly in the wind. The man inrnthe coat was the first to depart, but, just before doing so, he may have uttered one word: \"Thanks.\" His voice was quiet andrnsurprisingly non-threatening; sadder than it was angry orrnintimidating. He may have had a slight accent, but the driverrncouldn't place it. But maybe he hadn'trnsaid that. Judging by the loud storm outside, the shuffling ofrnpassengersâ€¦ there was a lot of white noise floating about, wasn'trnthere? It could have just been footsteps, the wind, myriad things.rnHis imagination. The driver found thernpossibility that he had imagined it oddly comforting, so he clung tornthat. The man was now out of sight, as were his other passengers. Hernembarrassedly realized he'd been daydreaming and hastily closed therndoors and started to drive off. The weather was still terrible. But if he hadn'trnimagined itâ€¦ Enough, he toldrnhimself. It was no use obsessing over something so insignificant. Besides, how much couldrnyou really tell from just one word? â€¦ The figure walked downrnthe street with quick purposeful strides. Aside from his coat, hisrnclothing was obviously new: Plain white t-shirt, dark expensivernjeans, a black ball cap. He was soaked but seemed to pay this nornmind, despite the waterfall falling from the brim of his cap directlyrnin front of his eyes. His eyes scanned hisrnsurroundings meticulously as he trekked, taking in every suburbanrndetail. The sky was a strange mix of navy blue and generic grey, arnhuge dome hanging low overhead. Dark trees whipped around, bentrnprecariously by the same heavy winds that flung a constant barrage ofrnraindrops his way. Spotting hisrndestination, the man quickened his pace and ascended the walkway.rnAfter pressing down harder than necessary on the button, he couldrnmake out the sound of the doorbell reverberating through the house.rnOther than that, there was no response. He rang again, and this timernhe heard movement from inside. A moment later, the door was jerkedrnopen to reveal a static-haired, bleary-eyed man wearing jeans and arnfaded shirt that looked like he had just thrown them on now. \"Dude,rndo you realize what time it is?\" he groaned. \"No, actually.\" \"Well, what do yournwant? You selling something?\" the tired guy asked aggressively. \"Don't yournrecognize me, Tom?\" Tom squinted hisrnbloodshot eyes at the traveler, scrutinizing him. Surprise suddenlyrnlit up his features, jolting him to full consciousness. \"O-Dog?\"rnhe said, disbelievingly. \"Yeah. Can I comernin?\" \"Sure,\" said Tomrndazedly. Inside, Tom handed Owenrnsome dry clothes and towels and started the coffee maker up. Thernplace was dark; though the curtains were open there was hardly anyrnlight outside to come through the window. Tom flicked a few switchesrnand the dwelling filled with yellowish light. Owen did as Tomrndirected him and silently took a seat at a kitchen chair, the towelsrnwrapped around him like blankets. Out of his tatteredrncoat, Owen looked very much the same as when Tom had last seen him.rnHe'd gained some weight, but not in a bad way, just as part ofrngetting older. It had been nearly ten years. Owen still lookedrnyoung and, aside from being too pale, healthy. Only his eyes gave anyrnindication of what he had gone through. They were wide and haunted,rnlike a TV show child-abuse victim's. \"I was worried yournwouldn't let me in,\" Owen intoned, breaking the silence. \"Of course I let yournin. You're my friend,\" Tom said. \"We haven't spokenrnsince high school.\" \"I know. But we canrnfix that now.\" \"You're not afraidrnof me,\" Owen remarked. \"Why?\" \"Well, why would Irnbe?\" reasoned Tom. \"I killed someone.rnEven with self-defense reducing the term, they ruled I was guilty.\" \"And since when havernI ever cared what \"they\" say?\" \"You mean, yournbelieve I was set up? Owen waited for confirmation. Tom sighed. \" Yeah. Irndon't think you'd have done something like that yourself.\" \"Thanks. Thatâ€¦ thatrnmeans a lot to me. That at least one person believes me.\" \"Hey, what arernroommates for?\" That caused a ghost of a smile to appear on Owen'srnface. \"That reminds me: How long do you plan on staying here,rnanyway?\" \"I'm sorry, Iâ€¦ Irndidn't mean to intrude. I can book into a hotel if that would berneasier for you,\" said Owen. \"No! That's notrnwhat I meant, I was just wondering how long you'd be in town andrnall.\" \"Oh. Well, I guess itrnwill take as long as I need to do what I came here for.\" \"And that would be?\"rnasked Tom, raising an eyebrow. \"I came to catch uprnwith someone,\" said Owen. \"And by someone yournwould meanâ€¦ me?\" inquired Tom. \"No, though it isrnnice to see you again. I came to find Dodger.\" Tom looked at himrnquizzically. \"Dodger? This 'cause you guys used to have a thingrnin high school?\" \"Actually, it'srnbecause she's the one who set me up.\" Tom paled. \"No,\" hernsaid shakily. \"No, that can't be right. I've known her forrnyears, we've gone for coffee together, kept in touch. I moved here because she said the job opportunities were good. You'rernsaying Dodger did it?\" Owen only nodded. Theyrnsat wordlessly for a moment, just listening to the coffee machinernburbling and the clock ticking away the seconds. Through the window,rnTom saw that a few rays of sun were managing to stretch their wayrnover the grey clouds. He stood up and poured them both a cup ofrncoffee, taking a long swill from his. It was scalding hot, but hernfelt he needed the energy as soon as possible. He was feeling veryrntired, and he didn't like the sensation one bit. \"Dodger did it,\"rnhe repeated into the silence. Turning to Owen, he said solemnly,rn\"Just be careful, man.\" â€¦ What's wrong withrnthis picture? Dodger's vivid bluerneyes scanned the classroom calculatingly, quickly picking out whatrnhadn't been there before: A tall neatly-dressed young man wasrnleaning against the back wall, nonchalantly watching the studentsrninteract. He was pale with curly light brown hair that fell in wavesrndown to just below his shoulders. A student teacher? She hadn'trngotten any notice about one. He suddenly looked up and gazed straightrnat Dodger, and she felt herself tense up, a bit embarrassed to havernbeen caught staring. He began to walkrndirectly in her direction. \"Oh, hello,\" he said casually. \"Isrnthis the advanced literature class?\" \"Yes, it is. Newrnhere?\" Dodger responded. Up close she saw he had deep brown eyesrnand soft features. \"Completely. I lookrnlost?\" Dodger smiled at that.rn\"No, actually. But I teach here and you do look unfamiliar. I thinkrnI'd remember if I'd met you before.\" He returned her smilernwith a friendly grin. \"Yes, I'm told I'm a pretty memorablernguy.\" They both jumped a bitrnat the jarring sound of the bell. \"Time for class.\" It was notrnDoger but the newcomer who stated the obvious, barely audible underrnhis breath. Momentarily, students ceased their conversing (or atrnleast reduced the volume a bit) and piled into their respectiverndesks. Dodger turned to thernnewcomer to tell him she'd find a place for him â€“ but he wasn'trnthere. \"Whereâ€¦\" she trailed off. At the front of the classroom,rnthe newcomer stood before the students, radiating authority. Shernrealized all the chatter in the room had ceased as the class lookedrnto him expectantly. It was a bit of an unprofessional way ofrndirecting himself, but she had to admit he did a good job of gettingrnthe students' attention. \"My name is KylernMcDermott,\" he began. \"I am a new student at this school and willrnbe attending this class.\" Wait. Student? He seems so much olderâ€¦rnThe fact that he was a student made his sudden speech much more cockyrnand justâ€¦ odd. Despite this he somehow managed to come across asrnformal and polite, even to Dodger. Her pupils weren't mocking himrneither, which was highly uncharacteristic of them. \"I apologize for anyrnconfusion that may have been caused by my arriving in the middle ofrnthe term. There was an incident at my former school that required myrnimmediate transfer.\" Incident? Dodger made arnmental note to look into that. \"Thank you for yourrnattention,\" he concluded, taking a seat in an empty desk near thernfront of the class. â€¦ Despite her surprisernthat morning, Dodger's day seemed to be progressing uneventfully.rnHer class that morning concluded in what seemed like seconds afterrnMcDermott's speech was over. She didn't see him again all day,rnnot that she really expected to considering the large number ofrnstudents attending the school. As she was driving the half-hour triprnback to her house, she recalled her plan to find out why he hadrntransferred. She couldn't quite place what, but there was somethingrnabout him she found oddly fascinating. Perhaps it was just that hernwas new, a mystery. She unlocked the doorrnto her house and stepped inside. That was strange; the lights werernon. She always turned them off before she left; it was routine. \"Dodger,\" a malernvoice stated. Startled, she glanced around herself, eyes coming tornrest on the man seated rigidly on a chair in her dining room. \"What are you doingrnhere? Who are you?\" she demanded. She knew she'd pissed a lot ofrnpeople off in the span of her life; it was part of being anyone in arnposition of authority. But she honestly had no idea who this was. \"Oh, you forgot me?rnTom didn't recognize me either, but I thought you at least would.rnThen again, I suppose you haven't seen me since high school.\" Owen.[Chapter 2] Eye of the Storm Chapter Two Smoldering â€¦ \"What do yournwant?\" Dodger finally asked. She was wracking her brain tryingrnto figure it out, but it just didn't make sense. He'd served hisrnsentence, so why not just move on? Admittedly, if it had been her shernwould have come back for revenge, but Owen had always been differentrnthan her. But time had changedrnhim. His brown eyes had lost their innocent, vulnerable quality, andrnnow all that remained was an intense, stony gaze, like he was takingrneverything in and wasn't particularly pleased with what he saw. Asrnthey stood there in the dim light, his mouth tonelessly formed thernwords, \"For you to be sorry.\" She replied, \"I'mrnsorry. Will you go now?\" Despite trying to keep her voicernequally toneless, the slightest hint of mockery crept in. Owen shook his head,rnexpression unchanging. Dodger had always beenrntalented at reading people, since she was a child. People were morernmathematical than they liked to admit, and for all their apparentrnirrationalities, it was just a matter of figuring out the formula.rnCrack that, and one could analyze anyone in but a moment - and hidernanything for as long as required. She had tricked people into givingrnher material things, power, even relationships. Anything she wanted,rnbecause she knew the formula. But this was different.rnShe wasn't the type to feel fear, but she was bothered. Notrnonly was Owen not acting like himself, he wasn't acting human. \"You misunderstandrnme. I have no desire for an apology. I want you to be sorry,\" saidrnOwen. Revenge? That had beenrnher first instinct, the logical path of action as well as the typicalrnemotional response. Across the table was a heavy iron paperweight. Hernwas going to hit her over the head with it. One hard whack, and thatrnwould be it. Or maybe he'd brought his own weapon. He didn't know thernpaperweight was going to be here, and he'd had time to plan this out.rnNothing spur of the moment whatsoever about this. Of course, Dodgerrnkept weapons of her own concealed around the house. Still slung overrnher shoulder, her purse contained the standard can of pepper spray,rnas well as a switchblade and a syringe full of a deadly, not tornmention highly illegal, poison. Perhaps it was a bit of overkill,rnpardon the pun, but she knew something like this would happenrneventually. She realized her hand was gravitating towards thernswitchblade. As Owen rose, herrnbreath caught in her throat. This was it, kill or be killed. Or both.rnMaybe he'd torture her? What she'd done to him had affected his lifernfor years, would probably always have some effect on him; he'd wantrnto do something lasting to her. She wouldn't allow him thernsatisfaction - that was what the syringe was for. Even a few dropsrnwould result in instant death. Technically, she supposed death wasrnsomething lasting, but it came eventually to everyone and she hadrnalways been unusually indifferent to the matter, to her advantage.rnFaced with death staring her directly in the face, she noted withrndull surprise that she had broken out in a cold sweat. Maybe she wasrna bit afraid. Huh. All these thoughts ranrnthrough Dodger's mind in the span of mere seconds, her naturallyrnabnormally fast thinking speed accelerated to the breaking point byrnfearâ€¦ or whatever it was. Images flashed behind her eyes â€“ rain,rnknives, blood, guns, glasses, metal piercings reflecting the light ofrnthe stars; an entire album of photographs taken subconsciously duringrnthose two nights she had played the angel of death, accompanied byrnstaccato piano music that came from nowhere. Owen. This was itâ€¦ But he didn't killrnher. He stood before her, leaned in and kissed her quick and hard onrnthe mouth before calmly walking out the door. Dodger ran out afterrnhim, shouting, \"Hey! Wait!\" but he didn't, couldn't becausernhe was long gone. It startled Dodger when it occurred to her thatrnafter he'd kissed her, she must have simply stood there like anrnidiot, lost in lack-of-thought. Her lips still tingled. It wasn't arnsentimental metaphor but a fact, although it was uncharacteristic ofrnher. Even her own body had betrayed her. What would she say whenrnshe saw Owen again? In fact, would she even see him again? Shernsomehow thought so, although that may just have been thernuncharacteristic sentimentality talking again. The criminal alwaysrnreturned to the scene of the crime, but Owen wasn't the criminal. She was. And she hadn'trnreturned. Yet. Not knowing what elsernto do, Dodger went to bed without bothering to eat or change, andrnsoon fell into a troubled sleep. â€¦ \"Yo! McDermott!\" By now the rain hadrnceased, and the thick grey clouds begun to disperse, allowingrnbrilliant blades of sunlight to infiltrate the forest. Wildrnevergreens towered overhead, and moss and other small plants carpetedrnthe muddy forest floor. To the casual observer, this would seem to bernone of the few retreats left untouched by deforestation, urbanrndevelopment, humanity in general. That is, until thernhouse came into view, along with the scruffy-looking teenage boyrnrunning out of it. Although nowhere close to the height of thernancient trees, the structure looming ahead was far from modest.rnCalling it a mansion would be more accurate than to refer to it as arnhouse. A rich, decadent mansion, at least from the outside. But Kyle,rnwho had seen the contents countless times, knew otherwise. \"Kyyy-lllle, get overrnhere already!\" Shut up! The scruffy boy was bouncing on thernballs of his feet with anticipation. Kyle actually slowed downrnslightly, amused at how each squelching step must be agony for thernimpatient other boy. \"Hello, Erik,\"rnacknowledged Kyle as he let himself in through the screen door.rnTaking a seat on a dilapidated old-fashioned chair, one of the sparsernfurnishings Erik had managed to salvage from outside a house on trashrnday, his eyes narrowed on the sticklike figure standing across thernroom, back arched as she gazed out the window. She was here.rnCarol. Although she was arn17-year-old girl, Carol took androgyny to a whole new level, whetherrnintentionally or not. With pale skin and freckles, as well as shortrnwild brown hair that looked as though it had never seen a comb in itsrnlife, Kyle did not find her the least bit attractive. Gawky and bony,rnshe was weak on so many levels. She obviously wanted people to likernher, despite having no social skills whatsoever and only everrndressing in cheap baggy pants and black heavy-metal t-shirts. Todayrnwas no exception; as she turned to face him, Kyle took in today'srnshirt, emblazoned with laughably poorly drawn blue-skinned zombies,rnno doubt from some album's cover art. She looked surprised to seernhim, but he reminded himself Carol always looked surprised, due tornher oddly wide eyes which were further magnified by her bent-uprnlopsided glasses, making her look like some freakish insect. Kyle wasn'trnparticularly fond of people in general, but he reserved a specialrnbrand of loathing strictly for Carol. Not that he let her know this,rnof course. Yes, he would subtly remind her of her own weakness, butrnalways while maintaining a faÃ§ade of friendship. He wasrnskilled at concealing his true feelings, a talent that came in greatrnuse for a person as full of hate as himself. Occasionally Kyle hadrnthe disturbing inkling she was aware of his hatred towards her, butrnhe always attributed such thoughts to paranoia and simply dismissedrnthem. Carol suffered from a well-deserved inferiority complex andrnprobably thought everybody hated her. Kyle would have beenrnall too happy to avoid all association with her, but she and Erik hadrncome as a package deal. And as much as Kyle detested being reliant onrnanyone else, he knew he needed Erik. At least for the time being. Kyle had met both Erikrnand Carol last year, on the first day of high school. He'd been onrnthe bus, and had just taken a seat near the front, by himself sincernhe saw no one he wished to socialize with. He sat there simplyrnlistening to the other students converse on the off-chance someonernsaid something that would prove useful. \"I've beenrnresearching, and I'm more convinced than ever that Owen was neverrnguilty.\" Kyle's ears pricked up upon hearing the boy's voice,rnand he turned all his focus to that discussion. \"I know. I mean, hernhad no motive.\" This voice was impossible to place on the genderrnspectrum. Rough and awkward sounding, like a rarely utilized toolrnthat had grown rusty. It really sounded likernthey were talking about the Westlake Prep Murders. But honestly, sincernwhen was that the type of thing people discussed on the bus? Kylernswiveled his head. One of the participants was an unhealthy-lookingrnteenager of indeterminate sex. The other was a chubby guy with longrngreasy brown hair, old unfashionable clothing that had probablyrnformerly been his father's, and the unpleasant beginnings of arnbeard. Obvious socialrnoutcasts. The only people whornwould possibly discuss this kind of thing on a school bus. Kylerndecided he would wait before approaching them; though he wasrncharismatic and knew it, he was also well aware that appearing toorneager around those kind of people, especially on his first day atrnthis new school, could effectively destroy his reputation before herneven had a chance to build it up. There was a high probability thisrnwas a false alarm, and he didn't want to find out these people knewrnnothing about the incident after blowing his chances of socialrnacceptance. So he waited patiently,rnsimply continuing to listen. He learned their names, Carol and Erik.rnHe learned his instincts had been correct, and they were outcasts.rnAnd he learned this wasn't a false alarm â€“ they really did knowrnthe case, maybe even better than he himself, though Kyle found themrnrather too sympathetic towards Owen. They weren't of the few whornclaimed Dodger was behind it all simply because they wanted anrnalternative minority opinion. They sincerely believed Owen had toornmuch \"moral fiber\" (not enough guts, Kyle knew they meant) to dornsuch a thing on his own free will. The teacher had been a sleaze,rnundoubtedly, but murder just didn't fit his patterns of behavior uprnuntil his death. Kyle himself had been arnlong-time lurker of such speculative websites and was familiar withrnthe sources quoted by Erik and Carol, such as the fan-madernpsychological profiles. The computer database at the high schoolrnwhere years ago it all went down had been hacked when a teenagerrnhalf-way across the country had realized the administration neverrnbothered to change the password from \" DEFAULT .\" The hackerrnhad accessed the records of all those involved, shared them with thernpeople on the murder's discussion \"fan\" websites. All grades,rnreport cards, and teacher's comments became public knowledgeâ€¦ ifrnone knew where to look. The speculators, most of them only teenagersrnthemselves, had no idea where the information came from, but had usedrnit to construct the psychological profiles. The administration stillrndid not know of the breach of security; indeed, only one person inrnthe world did. That person was Kyle,rnbecause he had been the hacker. And despite Erik and Carol'srn(especially the latter's) sappy over-sentimentalism, he believedrnthey were right about one thing: somehow, Dodger had been behind it.rnThe comments the teachers made about her were much the same as thosernKyle's teachers made about him: intelligent, popular, manipulative.rnOf course, that last comment was only made by teachers they had hadrnvery early in their school lives, before they'd learned tornmanipulate even teachers into seeing them as flawless. He had waited a fewrnweeks before approaching the Vultures, as those in thernmurder-obsessed \"community\" were known. During this incubationrnperiod, he never made more than brief eye contact, and they neverrnexchanged a single word. At least in person.[Chapter 3] Eye of the Storm Chapter Three Preparing â€¦ A few days before theyrnfirst spoke to Kyle, both Erik and Carol established close on-linernfriendships with a fellow murder enthusiast who went by the name ofrnWestlakeWolf. Meanwhile, Kyle wasrndeveloping his brand-new online alias: called WestlakeWolf, ofrncourse. Also unknown to Erik and Carol, Kyle had hacked into bothrntheir email accounts (Carol's security question had been \"What isrnmy dog's name?\" and she had answered it herself in her profile onrnone of the sites. It was a wonder someone hadn't gotten around tornhacking in sooner). He was already an expert on their hangouts,rninterests, musical tastes, habits, and personalities in general â€“rnand he had never even spoken to them face to face. He was prepared. So one day in thernhalls, after school had let out, Kyle approached the pair. Hernappeared completely casual about it; walked past their lockers on hisrnway to the door, turned around and did a double take. \"Say, haven'trnI seen you guys around?\" he'd said. Erik had answered him.rn\"Yeah, you're on my bus. In my calc class too, right? Advancedrnplacement 2B?\" \"Uh huh,\" agreedrnKyle, smiling shyly. Erik continued, \"I'mrnErik, and she's Carol.\" Kyle didn't actually give a shit aboutrnCarol â€“ after corresponding with her, he already knew too muchrnabout her to see any point in establishing a friendship with therngirl. She was strange, stupid, and just plain boring to him. He'drnseen her type before â€“ weak and trusting. True, they could bernuseful in some situations, but Kyle wanted to avoid spending any morerntime around her than strictly necessary. Erik was much morernintriguing. Possessing of a sharp, cynical sense of humor, not tornmention some interesting theories, he'd be of much more use, asrnwell as entertainment. Though Carol might be naÃ¯ve, heRrnrevolting innocence was not something that could be easily cast off.rnOn the other hand, Erik would be easy to manipulate, shape intornwhatever Kyle wanted him as. And what Kyle wanted was an accomplice. Oh yeah. He knew theirrntypes. Still playing the shyrnfaÃ§ade, Kyle introduced himself. He listened to Erik andrnCarol's introductions and small talk for a while, nodding along andrnoccasionally interjecting with short, polite monosyllables. Finallyrnhe asked, \"So, what kind of stuff are you interested in?\" \"The Westlake Preprnmurders,\" Carol answered, without the slightest hesitation. Erik threw a look ofrnmild annoyance her way. \"He doesn't want to hear about that kindrnof stuff, Car.\" \"Actually, I find itrnkind of interesting. Fascinating, really,\" encouraged Kyle. \"You know about thernmurders?\" said Erik. His eyes lit up. \"Of course. Whornhasn't?\" Erik nodded hisrnagreement. \"Yeah, but most forgot after the initial hype died down.rnThe public memory is pretty sad. It's a wonder the news doesn'trnstart out with 'Previously, on the news: Five seconds ago, yournheard me speak.'\" \"True,\" repliedrnKyle, laughing. \"Test time,\"rnannounced Carol, looking Kyle straight in the eye. \"Who do you think did it?\" Kyle appeared to thinkrnfor a moment. \"You knowâ€¦\" he pronounced, \"I'm ratherrnsuspicious of Dodger.\" Carol immediatelyrnhugged him, and Kyle awkwardly put his own arms around her, though herndidn't much like the feeling of her bony chest pressed against him. \"Welcome to the club,rnman.\" Erik had beamed as he extended a hand. Kyle took it, grinningrnback. And together with Erikrnand Carol, he had continued his research, hacking, and tracking,rnalways careful to remain several steps ahead of his assistants.rnFinally, a few months ago, there had been a breakthrough, and theyrnwere able to locate Dodger using her credit card information andrncookies placed on her computer. Kyle had thus decidedrnto meet and analyze her. He didn't know what Erik or Carol expectedrnhim to do now that he had found her, or even if they had planned thatrnfar. But he had. Now, in the badly litrnroom, Erik took a seat opposite Kyle and Carol, remaining standing,rnsaid, \"So? Did you find her?\" A smile found its wayrnonto Kyle's face. Probably the first genuine smile he had everrnaimed at her. \"Yeah, it's her all right.\" As much as Kylerndisliked Carol, he had to admit she had her uses. For one, she was arnconduit for information on Erik. And after all, it was her that hadrnfound them this place. According to Carol, her parents had gonernthrough a messy divorce in which they had both fought viciously overrnwho got custody of her. In an attempt to convince her to live withrnhim, her father had begun construction on an extravagant house in thernforest, knowing she loved nature. Just as the house was nearingrncompletion, he died of a stress-induced stroke, leaving the housernforever unfinished. Kyle had a great dealrnof difficulty believing this story. First of all, who would willinglyrnlive with Carol, much less fight over her? And if her family couldrnafford to build mansions, why did she look like an extremely tallrnstarving twelve-year-old boy? She ate wolfishly whenever she hadn'trn\"forgotten\" to bring lunch money. Not to mention the crappyrnclothes. But truth be told, Kyle didn't give a damn where she hadrngotten the place, because the important thing was simply that theyrnhad it. And it figuredrnprominently in his plan. â€¦ When Tom woke up thernnext morning and stumbled torpidly into the kitchen, he was greetedrnby the sight of Owen cooking. For a moment he simply stood there,rnfrozen by the strange sight, as Owen dexterously multitasked,rnadjusting the temperature of burners and flipping sizzling food overrnwith a spatula. Tom had never seen him like this. Not in high school.rnHe hadn't been morose or anything, but he wasn't really Mr.rnBright-An'-Cheerful either. He'd always been the kind of guy yournknew had seen a lot. So why would he lighten up after this wholernshitstorm? \"Good morning, Tom,\"rnOwen greeted him, serving up pancakes. \"Guess it went well,\"rngrunted Tom. He'd never been a morning person. \"Thanks.\" Hernaccepted a plate of pancakes and began to eat hungrily. \"Yes. It went veryrnwell, in fact.\" Tom looked directly atrnthe other man as they both sat down. Very seriously, he said, \"Look,rnOwen. Can I ask what you're trying to accomplish? If the copsrndidn't believe you before, what makes you think you can incriminaternher now?\" \"I don't want tornincriminate her. I want to make her sorry,\" Owen said simply. Tomrnwasn't sure what he meant by that so he decided to let it go. \"Whyâ€¦rnwhy did she do it?\" he finally asked. \"Long story.\" \"We got time.\" Owen sighed. \"Sheâ€¦rnshe was betrayed.\" Right then, Owen beganrnto tell Tom the whole story. Everything the police had left out, allrnin meticulous detail. A ridiculous conspiracy that no one wouldrnbelieve. Except Tom did believernit. Hell, how could he not? The way Owen told it, with the strangerncombination of pain and steel flowing like a river through the tale.rnIt explained a lot, even if it left even more unanswered. Or at leastrnunresolved. It was almost enough tornmake Tom lose his appetite. Almost. Tearing off a formidable hunk ofrnpancake and swallowing past the lump in his throat, Tom stated, \"Sornnow you're going to betray her.\" Owen shook his head.rn\"No. She doesn't trust me, so there's nothing to betray. Shernhas no faith in me. Only her misconceptions. And I'm going tornshatter those.\" He clenched his hands into fists, probably not evenrnaware he was doing it. Tom stole a glance outrnthe window. A dark cloud once again settled over the town, erasingrnthe sun's light. It was beginning to drizzle, tiny raindropsrnhitting the roof and leaves and pavement in disorderly drumbeats.rn\"Shit weather again,\" Tom noted in a mumble. â€¦ Dodger was distracted.rnNot that anyone would ever have guessed, of course. Her daily routinernrequired but a fraction of her concentration, after all. Shower andrnget dressed. Eat breakfast. Drive to the school. Simple. Hand outrntests and worksheets. Give speeches she could come up with inrnseconds. Answer questions from students. Still simple. Figure out what to dornabout Owen. Really not so simple. Thus she was habituallyrngoing through her day, her thoughts sounding like a rip-off of arnMasterCard commercial as she sat at her desk, twisting a lock of redrnhair around an index finger. Pencils scratched frantically on paperrnas her students struggled with a pop quiz â€“ her way of getting arnfew moments to herself. No questions allowed. Just write it. There was reallyrnnothing she could do legally. Or illegally, for that matter. Changernthe locks, watch her back. That didn't count for much. If she movedrnaway, he'd probably still find her eventually. Besides, she wasn'trnabout to let him control her life that way. If she moved it wouldrnjust be forfeiting, and Dodger never gave up until she won. He wasn'trnabout to best her at her own game. Why had he kissed her?rnDodger bit the tip of her tongue, tasting the warmth and iron of arnsmall amount of blood as it spread around the inside of her mouth. Itrndidn't make sense. She was a logical person, and she understoodrnpeople. The two concepts might seem incompatible, but she had made itrnwork up until this point, hadn't she? She understood reason. Andrnshe knew how unreasonable human nature could be. Owen didn't love her.rnHow could he? You couldn't love someone who betrayed you, stolenrnyears of your life, used you and marred your future. Maybe it wasrnjust plain lust. He was a man, after all, and she was an attractivernwoman. Some people went for being mistreated. In a weird way, it wasrna turn-on for some people. Owen had never seemed like that to her; hernwas easily lead, got himself into situations, but he would neverrnadmit to himself that he wanted that enough to act on it outright,rneven if there was a subconscious drive. Besides, lust was a messy,rnunplanned thing. This had a premeditated feel to it. The bell rang, jarringrnher from her thoughts and sending the students from the room. A pilernof tests accumulated on her desk in the time span of seconds. She began marking,rnabsentmindedly looking the sheets over. She didn't usually markrnduring school hours like this. She wasn't a procrastinator, butrnstudents and teachers alike might become suspicious if she went overrnall the tests in the fifteen-minute morning break. They'd think shernwasn't taking her job seriously â€“ or that she was smarter thanrnshe let on. And those assumptions, especially the latter, could landrnher in a whole lot of complications. But she was markingrnnow. It was a way to direct a small portion of her thoughts away fromrnthe black hole of the Owen situation. Once she got through thisrnclass's stack of papers, she pulled another pile of tests out of arndrawer in her desk and set to work on them. Unfortunately they werernmultiple choice, and she only had to look at the answer key once inrnorder to know which circles got a checkmark for being filled in. Itrnwas too easy. Twelve done, another nineteen to â€“ Wait. She paused, redrnpen hovering in mid-air. She flipped back a few pages, to checkrnsomething. Maybe she was being paranoid, but at least it gave herrnsomething to do. Besides, it wasn't paranoia if someone really wasrnout to get you. She found the testrnquickly, a single unremarkable sheet of paper festooned with redrn'X's. She took out the answer key, rechecked it. She took out thernoriginal booklet of test questions and compared them. This wasn't right.rnSomething was definitely up. She stood, gravitatingrntowards the telephone on her wall, the telephone that was connectedrnto every other telephone in the building. Slowly, almost reverently,rnshe began dialing. She spoke briefly, then put the receiver down withrna soft click. Pretty soon, the voicernof the secretary at the office boomed over the intercom: \"KylernMcDermott, please go to your homeroom. Kyle McDermott, to yourrnhomeroom. Immediately.\"[Chapter 4] Eye of the Storm Chapter 4 Slipping â€¦ \"I'm sure you knew this was inevitable.\" \"I was wondering when you'd come get me.\" \"Would you mind telling me what this is?\" \"My test.\" \"I know that.\" Kyle smiled embarrassedly. \"I'm sorry. Of course you knew that. Iâ€¦ I didn't do very well, did I?\" \"No.\" Dodger fixed him with a stern gaze. \"In fact, you received a lower mark than you would have if you'd guessed on every question. Why is that, Kyle?\" The boy looked down at his feet. \"I justâ€¦ I wanted you to know that I didn't understand the subject. I was worried I'd just barely pass and thenâ€¦ you know, get a crappy final grade.\" Dodger nodded, though she didn't believe his explanation for a moment. She wondered if he picked up on the suspicion in her expression; he seemed like he'd be aware of such subtle hints. \"Would you like remedial lessons?\" \"W-with you, you mean?\" \"Yes, until you understand the subject.\" \"I'd like that very much professor. Thank you. Thank you.\" \"Go to your next class. I'll write a note to explain why you're late. \"Thank you.\" Dodger handed him the note and with the awkward bow of a teenage boy who watched too many late-night Japanese movies, Kyle was gone. No, she didn't believe his explanation. Kyle was smarter than he let on, but he wasn't as sly as he thought. He was a hormone-driven teenager; she was attractive. Instant romantic dramedy fodder. Truth be told, she was flattered, though she knew better than to let it go to her head. Kyle liked her. If she had actually been in a romantic dramedy, she would have said something along the lines of, \"You still got it, girl.\" Dodger Allen's life was of an entirely different genre. Normally she would have brushed Kyle's advances off quick and clean, but this was anâ€¦ abnormal situation. She could use an ally, willing to sacrifice himself for her. Even if he was unwilling, he had a good chance of doing that anyway. Or, rather than an ally and more likely, in the event of something happening with Owen, she would have a scapegoat. With only a school wall between himself and Dodger, Kyle couldn't contain a smile. He knew better than to think this would be easy â€“ the execution of the plan. But it was, so far, going along perfectly. He played the smitten student role well. So many people modeled themselves on stereotypes; it was hardly a challenge to imitate. But Dodgerâ€¦ she wasn't a stereotype. She wasn't a stupid ditz. She was cunning. She had depth. And she'd fallen for his act. He had to admit, he was rather fond of her. But she was dead wrong to think his fondness for her would distort his judgment in any way. -.-.-. Dodger was feeling a great deal more in control of herself as she left work later that day, taking a detour through the park. Though not sentimental, she did have an appreciation for beauty. Beautiful people, music, nature â€“ all were soothing. If it wasn't for her own beauty, combined with the lust and vanity of others, her life would have taken a completely different, likely less interesting path. Yes. She was in control. The air smelled sweet and earthy, the scent carried by the gentle breeze that seemed to be all that remained of the storm. The vivid green grass between her feet was adorned with a smattering of water droplets, glimmering in the bright sunlight. Dodger ran a hand through her long red hair, feeling the fine strands slip through her fingers. For another moment, close to the surface, she was fine. She was admiring a row of blue, white-capped mountains on the horizon when her eyes suddenly shifted focus to the foreground. For a split second, she was clueless as to what her body was trying to tell her. Then she saw him. His so-familiar profile brought her out of her trance. As she called out his name, his head snapped up and they made eye contact, his eyes immediately going deer-in-the-headlights wide before he spun around and broke into a sprint. She ran after him, her long legs easily falling into the quick, loping rhythm, entire body having long ago memorized the flow. Her breaths were measured, calculated and unstrained, and the bottoms of her runners gripped the ground as her feet adeptly found hold on the earth each time they came down. Even if she'd worn heels that day, she probably would still have outrun him â€“ she'd always been the superior athlete. The distance between the two sprinters quickly closed, and Dodger was finally able to make a grab at his elbow. Thrown off balance, at the same time his foot entangled itself in a tree root and he crashed down face-first on the wet grass beneath the sycamore trees, taking Dodger with him (It's like a bad movieâ€¦). He pulled himself out from beneath her slight mass, and though his eyes darted in all directions, he made no move to escape. Sensible of him, thought Dodger. Though a bit late. She looked around, saw a few people talking/walking/mingling off several meters away. The two of them were invisible, obstructed from view by the surrounding flora. \"Why did you run from me, Tom?\" she asked evenly. \"I thought you were someone else. A girl. One I dated, I mean. Things ended badly.\" He stood, brushing dirt and mud off her jeans. Dodger also rose, leaning casually against a tree trunk. \"You've been talking to Owen, haven't you?\" \"No!\" She allowed her expression to soften, become sympathetic. \"Tom, he came to visit me. Iâ€¦ I don't think he's well. Jail's been hard on him.\" \"Okay, I saw him. But I really did think you were my ex, that's why I ran!\" Dodger decided it wasn't worth it to bother arguing. \"Never mind. Is Owen staying with you?\" \"No,\" said Tom, shaking his head. \"He stopped by, but he's gone now.\" Dodger carefully studied his face. Stony, unexpressive. He was telling the truth. Lies were always obvious with him, and like many guys he tried to avoid \"doing\" emotions. \"Okay,\" said Dodger. She exhaled. \"Okay. Sorry.\" \"Jesus, Dodger.\" Tom brushed his hair back with his hand. He was still breathing hard. \"What was that about?\" \"Hey, chill,\" she said, trying to bring the tone back to the usual easy casualness between them. She really did find Tom quite likeable. He was direct, easy to read. She always knew all about him. It was reassuring. She winked at him. \"You've been avoiding me lately. I wanted to know what was going on.\" \"Yeahâ€¦ things have been crazy.\" \"Tell me about it,\" said Dodger with a small laugh, and they parted ways after making lunch plans. If Owen tried anything more, perhaps Tom would be closer to the information than she, and she could easily fish it out of him. Dodger smiled. She was in control. -.-.-. \"She knows.\" Owen looked up from the brown bag of food Tom had brought back from a nearby Jewish deli, but he continued to rifle through it. \"Dodger, you mean?\" he asked. \"What does she know?\" \"About you. About us.\" Tom was pacing, his eyes darting around the room. Owen had located sustenance and began eating, taking the time to swallow a mouthful of bagel and lox before replying, \"Tom, you make it sound like a conspiracy.\" \"Well, isn't it?\" Tom said, anger flashing in his wide eyes. \"If it's true, and she finds outâ€¦ screw it, I don't even know what I'm doing involved in all this!\" \"You're not involved!\" Owen stood up, somehow managing to look authoritative despite the bagel he was waving about. \"Remember that. This is my problem, not yours. She can't blame any of this on you.\" \"Damn it, Owen! What exactly are you planning on doing to her?\" \"I'm going to make her sorry,\" said Owen evenly. \"But what does that mean?\" \"You'll know when it happens.\" Owen calmly sat down, going back to his lunch. \"Now then,\" he said once he'd finished the bagel, \"you say Dodger knows I'm here?\" \"Uh huh. Well, I have the suspicion she knows, at least. I got this vibe from her, like she was trying toâ€¦ I don't know, read my mind.\" Tom gave a shaky shrug. \"It sounds so stupid to say it.\" \"It doesn't. I know what you mean.\" \"Just, when I was talking to her, it got so weird. You know, I really got the feeling she could have done it.\" 'It' being killing people. It was like she could do that without batting a perfectly made-up eye. \"I suppose I should leave, then. Thank you for your hospitality.\" Owen stood once again as he spoke, and he made his way towards the door. \"Wait!\" said Tom, surprised by the other man's abruptness. \"Where are you going?\" Owen turned his neck slightly so that he spoke vaguely in the direction of the inquirer. \"Why do you ask, Tom?\" The corners of Owen's mouth turned up in a small smile. \"It's none of your business. Not like we're co-conspirators or anything of the sort.\" \"Well, let me know if there's anything I can do for you, in any case.\" \"Trust me; if anything comes up, you'll know.\" And Owen was gone as suddenly and as enigmatically as he'd appeared. -.-.-. Dodger arranged with Kyle to meet after school each weekday for approximately an hour. These meeting were held in her classroom, when most of the staff had already left the building. \"I think I'm starting to understand,\" said Kyle one day, a few weeks into their lessons. \"The subject, you mean?\" said Dodger. She was scrawling notes on the blackboard, causing a light snowfall of white chalk dust to fall at her feet. \"Yes, that too.\" Kyle, standing at Dodger's side, leaned in towards her, gently touching her hand as he took the chalk, It wasn't clear who initiated it, but suddenly their mouths were touching, and they were kissing, hard. It was a long time before Dodger was able to process what was happening and pull out; but it was already far too late, Kyle smiled before calmly turning to the chalkboard and, in a few deft strokes, completing Dodger's unfinished sentence. \"By the way,\" he said, \"I'm having a party this weekend. You're invited. Will you be there?\" \"Yeah,\" said Dodger. There was nothing else she could say. She'd let it go too far. She was barely aware as Kyle gathered up his books and backpack and left the room without looking back. She could get out of this. She knew she had gotten out of worse before. He wouldn't be able to stop thinking about her now. She could use him against Owen. Somehow. Had she established anything besides that vague initiative? She could confuse Kyle. Keep him guessing. Have him defend her against Owen when she tracked him down. But if he found her first? That didn't change anything, she could keep Kyle close by as much as she had to. Owen wasn't as strong (no, that wasn't the word, but she couldn't stop her thoughts to find the right one) as her â€“ he'd get emotional. Careless. Leave hints. And Kyle would be there when he finally appeared. That was why she had done it. She sank down to her knees, the cold of the checkerboard tiles on the floor making her shake as they touched her legs. She put her forehead against the wood of the desk and started to cry. If any staff members had stayed late and somehow seen her misconduct, they might pity her and stay silent, seeing what she was going through. An observer might even think love was somehow, mysteriously involved. And if Kyle was somewhere outside, watching her, seeing her, he'd feel guilty. Feel he owed her. He'd be loyal. Screw it, she was making this up as she went along. She had no idea what had happened or what would happen now. She only knew she would have to be careful. Her vision obscured by tears, she never bothered to look up at the blackboard. Even if she had, her brain might not have been able to sort the symbols into any logical sequence. Behind her, in her own neat, confident script, the words, \"Philophobia, from the Latin prefix \"Philo-\" and the word \"Phobos\" means\" stood out stark white against their black background. In curly, elegantly thought-out letters, Kyle had concluded the sentence with \"fear of love.\" The period at the end made it all look so final, but like the rest of the sentence, it was wiped away early the next morning by the school custodian and a bucket of soapy water. -.-.-. \"Yo Carol! Catch!\" On reflex, the teenage girl made the assumption it was Erik calling her, and she looked up just in time to be hit in the face with a raw egg. She stood wide-eyed and silent as she watched the boys bike away, laughing. Their bikes swooshed and clanged as they cut through the air, chains, wheels, and spokes spinning with mechanical enthusiasm. \"Freak!\" one cyclist shouted, and one â€“ she couldn't tell if it was the same guy â€“ raised a middle finger. None of them looked back at her. Her classmates disappeared between rows of houses as the grey sky roiled above the rooftops. Carol wiped as much of the thick, translucent liquid off herself as she could, spitting out the bitter globs that had found their way into her mouth. She stared down at the shattered eggshell at her feet, laying there like abstract art, surrounded by a pool of spattered liquid. She resumed walking. She hated the people at her school. This was the third egg this semester. The boys were actually not as bad as the girls â€“ at least the former were direct. They didn't go around behind her back, starting rumours and throwing her books in the toilet or telling the counsellor she was creepy and morbid and probably mentally ill. At least, they didn't do that as far as she knew. For some reason, nothing she did at school was right. If she talked, she was annoying. If she didn't talk, she was a freak. Her classmates stuck pencils in her curly hair when she sat in class, and between classes sneered, \"you know you're a girl, right?\" Every day, for eight and a half hours, she was surrounded by people who made her feel intrinsically wrong. So many times she'd had the urge to burn that hated place to the ground. Erik was the only thing that stopped her. When they were together, laughing and complaining about the assholes who surrounded them, it felt somehow noble. Like it was the two of them versus the world, rebels against high school's fascist atmosphere. As if this hellhole was a trial to overcome, not a punishment for being somehow broken. It was good to have a friend. Even just one. By the time she stopped home to shower and change, the egg had coagulated in her hair, on her clothes, even on her eyelashes. The white and yellow goop stuck out hideously on the black. She was feeling a great deal cleaner once she'd washed and gotten ready to head out to meet Erik. A couple years back, she would have had to sneak out to see him. Her mother was rather paranoid about her children leaving the house, especially when it came to Carol and That Strange Boy. She'd pronounced the phrase like a proper name. Somehow, her mother had gotten it into her head that Erik was the reason for her daughter's oddness. She was the type of woman who never allowed herself to consider that her own flesh and blood could ever be simply, unaccountably different. But her mother was asleep, as she was most of the time these days. A bottle of painkillers lay open on her bedside, a wad of drool leaking from the corner of her mouth. Carol closed the bedroom door harder than necessary, knowing her mom wouldn't be lucid enough to respond even if it did wake her up. It was a weird feeling, wishing her mom would scream at her. Wishing she'd just do something . Carol opened the door to the fridge, but no food had magically appeared. She made a mental note to go to the bank and withdraw the limited funds in her account to buy groceries for herself and Benny, after she was done at the forest house. She had some money from her job as a cashier at the grocery store, though they didn't give her a lot of hours. She didn't know how to small talk the customers, so they tended to avoid her till, which management didn't take kindly to. As her shoes squelched through the forest, she felt the tension slowly unknotting, though her stomach continued to gnaw at itself. \"Hey!\" she called out once she saw the house, spotting Erik on the roof. He was hammering, the beat steady and loud as it traveled through the trees. He grinned at her, mouth full of silver nails. A red halo leaked around the edges of his silhouette in the light of the setting sun. \"Nice to see you're finally here.\" He climbed down the ladder, then leaping the length of the last few rungs. \"Yeah. Daniel and his friends held me up.\" \"Are you all right?\" His smile had vanished. It was painful to see him serious â€“ Carol hated when he worried about her. \"I'm fine,\" she said. She released a long breath. \"I just can't believe Kyle invited those ass-wipes to the party.\" \"Well,\" said Erik, a hand on his forehead as he blocked out the bright sun and stood back to survey the roof, like he was saluting his own work, \"he must have a good reason. Kyle's a smart guy. Maybe Daniel will be a decoy.\" Carol had to grin. The idea of Daniel as live bait for a murderer was appealing. \"He hates me, you know.\" Erik looked at her oddly. \"Of course I know that. I thought we'd established that in fifth grade when he put on a show for the neighbourhood of him feeding his dog your skateboard.\" \"Not Daniel. Kyle.\" \"He does not hate you.\" \"Have you seen the way he looks at me?\" The words came out more frantic than intended. \"Look,\" said Erik calmly, \"he would have told me if he didn't like you. He tells me these things.\" \"Did he tell you what exactly he's planning to do with a serial killer at my house?\" \"She's not a serial killer.\" \"Yes, she is. She killed more than one person.\" \"But she didn't have a signature to her crimes.\" \"Dude, just answer my question.\" Erik picked up a rock and threw it hard and far into the forest. \"Okay, he told me some things. But I really don't know why he'd invite Daniel.\" \"What did he tell you?\" Her frustration fizzled beneath genuine excitement. The party was this weekend, but she'd been anticipating it for what felt like forever. Any scrap of information felt like an early birthday present, like her father used to send her when she was a kid, when she believed he would come rescue her from her life. \"Only what I have to do,\" said Erik. \"Just tell me already!\" \"Okay. Inside.\" Carol couldn't help the leap her insides did when he opened the door for her. As the two teenagers sat on the dark, mismatched furniture of the place that felt like hers, even if the law would say otherwise, Erik told Carol everything he knew and she listened with rapt attention. \"Wow,\" she said when he had finished. \"That'sâ€¦ intense, man. Do you think you can actually go through with this?\" \"I have to, don't I?\" said Erik, and Carol thought she detected a note of glumness in his voice. She didn't answer. She couldn't help but wonder if she too had a place in this plan, and whether she would even know if she did.[Chapter 5] Hello, and thank you for reading this story. After two years since I last worked on it, I have felt the inspiration to come back to it. I would like to thank -xXxBlonde ambitionxXx-, who submitted a review which reminded me that this story existed. I have now decided to finish this story. There will be a few more chapters, probably around three to five, which shall be posted quite shortly if all goes according to plan. Please review, as I would very much appreciate it and they encourage me to write faster. I think I should mention that the opinions expressed by characters are not necessarily my own. Reading over this, many of the things Kyle thought about Carol were extremely offensive and disturbing. They were meant to be, as Kyle is not a good person, but I am worried I went too far. So if anyone was bothered, I am truly sorry. Eye of the Storm Chapter Five Falling Dodger knew better than to try to evade the party. She could admit to herself that she had made a severe mistake â€“ thrown off by all the commotion with Owen, she had acted carelessly and allowed Kyle to have power over her. If he told anyone what had happened between them, she would be out of a job at the least. She was a good judge of what people would believe, and Kyle's story was much more convincing than any lie she could come up with. Private lessons. After hours. Like that didn't sound suspicious. Even if he admitted to initiating it, she hadn't resisted. He could even claim she had led him on. Had she led him on? Dodger thought about it during the series of long bus rides, listening to the clink of small change as people boarded, the rattle of gravel hurtled against the bus by wind. It was not a pleasant topic to think about, but Dodger knew the most dangerous lies were the ones people told themselves. And she was getting old. Older. She was only in her late twenties, but most of the people she had grown up with seemed to suddenly be married. She had recently run into a woman at the supermarket whom she had gone to high school with, and who had informed Dodger she was in the process of working through her second divorce. Dodger didn't need anybody. In fact, a long-term relationship sounded like a pain. Having to spend so much time around one person, especially when most people were moronic. Having to learn all their flaws, every irritating detail. Having to expose her own irritating details to them. She didn't like that, the need to either truly trust or to fake it. She didn't need it. But it would have been nice if someone had offered. She had to wonder what was the problem, that no one even seemed to be even trying to get close to her as of late. She knew that many of her friends from high school were in the same situation. Tom, for example. But he was... different, wasn't he? He had never been the same since the murders, suddenly drawing inward and becoming much more somber. She couldn't be like that. One thing she could not stand the thought of being was obviously damaged. -/-/- Flashback To say it wasn't a very good party was like saying Atlantis was a bit damp, or that Darly, the woman he'd asked to be his plus-one, was sorta starting to irritate him. This party was shit. Not the shit, just shit. \"Retro\" music played over the crummy speakers, laced with static whenever it hit certain notes, the kind of songs that were considered classic even though Tom had to wonder whether anyone liked them when they first came out. The only thing he could find of value in the blare was that it managed to drown out some of the conversation. He marched through the buffet line, determinedly fixated on his food and the number of minutes until it would be acceptable to leave. As he returned to his table, he briefly debated whether he could take one of the empty seats that wasn't beside Darly without pissing her off and causing a racket, and concluded that he couldn't. As he sat down beside her, she promptly threw her arms around him and squealed \"Tommy!\" \"Hey,\" said Tom, pretending to be fascinated by his napkin. The fabric was embroidered with the words \"WESTLAKE PREPARATORY, FIVE YEAR REUNION\" in silver thread. Darly resumed a conversation with a woman sitting to her left, the date of a guy Tom remembered as being named Jack or Jeff or something. He was also sitting with them, clad in a black suit and red tie, looking politely disinterested. The picture of success, and, though he'd been polite to Tom, Tom couldn't help the twinge of dislike he felt whenever he looked at the other man. Their table was also populated by a black-haired, olive-skinned woman in a purple dress, who was on her way to getting some sort of complicated university degree (Tom couldn't remember what she was studying â€“ when he asked it had been a long word he hadn't understood), a frazzled blond woman named Joan, her frazzled husband Steve, Joan and Steve's two extremely emotional infants (who were currently screaming gibberish at each other as they dueled over a soda cracker), and Randall. When Randall had shown up, Tom had experienced a wave of... triumph? relief? upon seeing the other man was alone. This was followed by a surge of embarrassment at having such a selfish thought. Grow up, Tom. He was too old for the teenage desire to outdo his friends in their romantic exploits. He awkwardly put his arm around Darly, who looked surprised but pleased at the gesture and leaned her head against his shoulder. She was warm, and it felt good to have her there. Yes, she wasn't perfect, but neither was he. Tom felt like he was pretty much as imperfect as a person could get and still manage to function in a relatively normal manner. He had met Darly at work â€“ they were both checkoutpeople at the supermarket. It wasn't what Tom had pictured himself doing, but he hadn't really pictured himself doing anything. His father had wanted him to be an engineer, and Tom had tried that. He'd enrolled in the classes. But as the days went by, he found himself more and more bored with it, until he skipped more days than he went. Now that he was living on his own, far from his family, he found no drive to learn the subject. He'd switched to distance learning, but hadn't completed the assignments or written enough tests to get credits. His part time job became full time, and the days passed in a lazy haze. He didn't know very much about Darly. She managed to talk a lot and yet say very little. They watched movies together sometimes, and she was always kind to him. If he was sick from work she would visit his house to make sure he was okay. They went for walks and picnics sometimes, and she would hold his hand and smile up at him with such honest happiness that in those moments he couldn't help but like her quite a lot. When she was silent like that, she somehow managed to be so much more expressive and real than when she was talking, as usual. She went on and on about soap operas and about her fish, and about things that she found funny but Tom didn't even find interesting. She wore too much sparkly makeup and too many pink hair clips, and Tom always got the impression she was trying to appear younger than she was. He didn't have a number for her age, but she had some crows' feet and her forehead was creased. Darly was trying to hide her age. Tom was trying to hide his aloneness. All these polite people were trying to hide the fact that they were competing over who was more successful, and all this pleasant chatter was just an attempt at hiding that barely anyone here had kept in touch. Nothing at this party was real. Maybe that was fitting for a high school reunion after all. He drained his glass as someone made a speech he didn't listen to. Afterwards, Darly gave an account of all the fascinating things everyone else at the table had been up to, which was made bearable only by the two more glasses of alcohol Tom consumed. He noticed Randall didn't seem to be engaged in the conversation much either, and felt a bit better. A flash of red caught his eye, and Tom excused himself, giving Darly a kiss in the hopes it would dissuade her from following him. It did, and she went back to chattering with the rest of the table about Tom's life. As Tom walked away, he caught the word \"fascinating\" in her voice and snorted. It was hard to think of anyone with a less fascinating life. He followed the red sheen. \"Dodger, yo,\" he said. Dodger was wearing a blue dress and dangly silver earrings shaped like feathers, which were bobbing along as she talked to a man in a dress shirt. \"Hi Tom!\" she said warmly. \"You remember Jonah, right?\" \"Hey,\" said Tom, waving at the man, who grabbed his hand and shook it. \"So what have you been up to?\" said Jonah, and Tom wondered if he was imagining the pompous tone in his voice. \"Oh, you know, the usual stuff,\" said Tom. \"School?\" said the man, and Tom suddenly felt like a teenager talking to an adult. \"You know it,\" said Tom with a giant fake-ass grin. The man launched into a description of his own \"fascinating\" life, and Tom felt his eyes glazing over. When Dodger excused herself to go talk to someone else she'd seen, Tom followed her. \"How do you stand it?\" he said in an undertone. \"Stand what?\" said Dodger. \"Everyone here is so... so fake.\" She laughed. \"They were the same five years ago. Did you really expect them to change?\" He thought he saw something in her eyes for a moment. Like for one split-second she could have started to cry. But then it was gone, and he pushed away the thought. This was Dodger he was talking to. One of the strongest people he knew. He was probably more likely to burst into tears than she was. \"Are you okay?\" he asked, before he could stop himself. It was the alcohol: goodbye impulse control. \"Fine,\" said Dodger, her voice a bit high but that was probably due to confusion at his question. \"So, who's that girl you came with?\" \"Darly. I work with her.\" \"Is she always like this?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"You know you can do better, right?\" He was silent. \"Sorry,\" said Dodger. \"I wouldn't know what to say to that, either.\" \"So...\" said Tom, \"did you come with someone?\" Dodger jabbed a thumb in the direction of one of the suits. \"Oh,\" said Tom. \"He looks... cool.\" \"Yeah. Between you and me, he's one of the most excruciatingly uninteresting people I've ever met.\" She sighed. \"You can probably tell I've been drinking.\" \"So have I,\" said Tom. \"You want to go outside for some air? Come back in when we're sober?\" \"Will this party be tolerable then?\" \"No, but it will be over.\" He followed her into the night. The parking lot was quiet and empty of people. Filtered though the walls, the soft thump of music was almost pleasant. Overhead, the moon and stars were bright. They walked, Dodger's high heels clicking on the pavement, the slightly-too-long ends of Tom's pants scraping on the ground. It did feel better out here. Clearer. \"So how did you meet...\" Tom tried to remember the man's name and couldn't recall Dodger mentioning it, \"that guy?\" \"A coworker set us up. I guess she thought I was really boring.\" Dodger laughed quietly. \"Or maybe she just didn't like me much.\" They were in a park area now. The river flowing beside them was shiny and black. Tom kicked a rock into it and listened to the satisfying splash. The rush of water was calming. They walked in silence for a while. \"You're not, you know,\" said Tom suddenly. \"Huh?\" \"Boring. You're not.\" \"That's sweet of you.\" And then they were quiet again. Tom had expected something to happen. It was the right night for it, the right feeling. They were both intoxicated. But nothing happened. At least, nothing he could explain. It was quiet, and comfortable, and he was... happy. But when they got back to the party, which felt like years later, like worlds later, he wasn't lying when he told Darly that nothing beyond friendly interactions had happened between him and Dodger. It felt strange when he went back into the school, too bright and warm and loud. Darly had approached him and stiffly announced they were to go back to the car. \"She's just a friend,\" Tom heard himself say. \"We went out for some air.\" Darly didn't respond. She sat down in the passenger seat. \"You have no right to be angry!\" said Tom. \"Drive,\" said Darly. He drove. \"Drop me off at my place, please,\" said Darly. \"Sure,\" said Tom. \"Listen, why are you so ups-\" \"I'm not upset,\" said Darly. But to Tom's horror, she started to cry, eyeliner trailing blackly down her face. \"Do you... want anything?\" said Tom, each word so uncomfortable it was like the syllables had turned into bricks. \"Just time,\" said Darly. Her voice was so different from usual. Plain. Broken. \"Are you mad at me?\" \"No.\" She paused. \"I'm mad at myself.\" \"What?\" \"I let myself...\" she hiccoughed. \"Hope. Ridiculously. I wanted to be the one that helped you, that made you happy. But... this distance is always going to be here, isn't it?\" Tom wasn't sure what to say. If he asked \"What distance?\" it would be a lie, to pretend he didn't feel it too. But if he said \"Yeah\" it would probably make her cry more. So he said nothing. He dropped her off and then returned to his own house, where he fell asleep to an awful movie and then showed up late for work the next day. -/-/- The bus came to a halt at a station in the town where Kyle used to attend school, and Dodger heard the rush of air and felt the vehicle deflate a bit as the doors opened. She stepped off and walked towards the red brick building ahead. The mouse brown hair of her wig fluttered around in the wind, and she absently patted it down. Once inside the school, she quickly examined herself in the bathroom mirror and once again came to the conclusion that her disguise was satisfactory. She knocked on the door of the guidance office, and was greeted by a middle-aged woman with cropped blond hair. \"Ah, you must be Ms. Nithiska,\" said the woman, unaware that the real Bethany Nithiska was currently unconscious, after Dodger had followed her home and attacked her from behind with a chloroform-soaked rag, leaving her on her couch where, hopefully, Bethany Nithiska would assume she had simply fallen asleep after a hard day's work as guidance councellor. \"Yes,\" said Dodger. \"And are you Mrs. Hopson?\" \"I am she. Do come in.\" As Dodger sat down in her office, Mrs. Hopson said, \"And as I understand it, you are here regarding Kyle McDermott?\" \"Yes,\" said Dodger. \"I hope you can see he is a good student.\" Hopson looked slightly worried. Dodger reassured her, \"Yes, he definitely is. But he seems somewhat distracted, and I think I could better help him if I knew the reason why he was transferred.\" \"It was not due to any wrong he committed,\" said Hopson. \"I'm sure it wasn't,\" said Dodger. \"He helped the school, in fact. He happened upon a plot by another boy to stage an... an attack upon the student body. Kyle reported it and the other boy was investigated and expelled. Somehow, Kyle's name was leaked as the one who had reported the boy, and as the boy had a large and rather threatening group of friends, it was decided it would be in the interest of Kyle's own safety to be transferred to another school.\" Dodger nodded somberly. Mrs. Hopson said, \"If you would like, I can give you the name of the boy and the psychiatrist he was sent to. They may be able to provide more insight into the occurrence, as I only dealt with Kyle, who was, understandably, quite upset at the time.\" The blond woman wrote down two names on a piece of paper and handed them to Dodger. \"Thank you,\" said Dodger. One of the names sounded familiar, and yet she couldn't place where she had heard it before.[Chapter 6] A/N: Sorry this is not the most exciting chapter. The next ones are going to make up for it, I promise. Eye of the Storm Chapter Six Connecting \"It's important you understand, Darren isn't a bad kid,\" Marianna said to the young woman seated at the other end of her polished wooden desk. This wasn't where Marianna saw her patients. She conducted her sessions in the room out front, a spacious, comfortable area, windows positioned so as to always allow as much clear, bright light as possible to enter. This section of her office was reserved for paperwork, and meetings of a less personal nature. \"His situation,\" Marianna continued, \"has been difficult lately.\" \"So I've heard,\" said the visitor with a nod. She was in her late twenties, sporting shoulder-length brown hair and a tan pantsuit. She had introduced herself as Brienna James, guidance counselor at a new alternative school Marianna hadn't heard of before. To Doctor Marianna Hampton, Brienna James came across as serious and focused. \"It will be good for him to go back to school,\" said Marianna. \"He's not the type to be content with isolation.\" \"Students like him are precisely why Westbough Academy was set up,\" said Ms. James. \"His grades were high before he was expelled, correct?\" \"Yes. His teachers agree that, academically speaking, he was above average.\" \"And you can report that his behavior has stabilized?\" When Marianna didn't answer, the other woman said, \"Is something wrong?\" \"I need a moment to answer your question about Darren,\" said Marianna, looking down at her hands as she spoke. \"In terms of behavior, he hasn't been lashing out. But on an emotional level... he's still deeply upset. I don't intend to dissuade you from allowing him into your school â€“ I think it would be beneficial to him to be around others his own age who might... understand. But you should know that he is unhappy at this point. He refuses to talk about what happened.\" She paused. \"I trust you know the details of the incident?\" \"To a general degree,\" said Ms. James. \"You should know that he could have reduced his sentence. The files found on his computer had no indication that he intended to use them. If he had said they were simply an... experiment, he would likely have been only suspended. Even if he confessed that he intended to put the plan to use, I imagine he would have been sent to counseling and given a leave of absence rather than outright expelled. It was his refusal to confirm nor deny what he was being accused of which caused the authorities at his school the greatest distress.\" \"Why would he have received such a minor penalty if he had been planning to use them?\" Brienna was clearly interested, to the point that her professional manner began to slip. There was something odd about her eagerness, Marianna thought. Something odd about her in general, perhaps, but it was hard to know exactly what was off. She found herself thinking how much she would have liked to be in the outer room, asking Brienna questions and figuring out what was going on in her mind. \"Honestly, I do not believe he would have been able to go through with it,\" said Marianna, \"and I think his teachers, as well as anyone who knew him, would have to agree. Various tests have been conducted, of course, and they clearly show that he is not a psychopath, nor suffering any other severe mental imbalances. Simply from talking to him, I cannot imagine he could be the type to injure or kill one person. To say that he would do such a think to many... the thought of it is outright bizarre.\" -/-/- After leaving Doctor Marianna Hampton's office, Dodger considered changing her disguise again. This was risky, what she was doing â€“ taking on the identity of someone who, as far as she knew, had never existed. If she been able to plan this in advance, she would have disguised herself as someone who had been alive at one point or another, probably someone around her age who had died prematurely on some other part of the globe. But there wasn't time for research, so she improvised. Continuing to insist she was Bethany Nithiska was more risky, as the real Nithiska would be waking up soon, and, if Dodger continued to use her identity, might cause some commotion by being in two places at once. Dodger decided that, for now, it was best to remain as Brienna James. Hampton seemed like the type of woman who would check up with the boy to see what had happened during his meeting with the new guidance counselor. From what Hampton had said, talking to Darren could prove quite interesting. It wasn't Darren she intended to find out about, but rather Kyle. How had Kyle found out about Darren's plan, his computer files documenting his intent to injure or kill many ?And yet, Darren was the kind of person who had too many inhibitions to go through with it. Dodger had him pegged as an outcast, so why would social, outgoing Kyle know him? All she knew was that Kyle was becoming more and more interesting. When she arrived outside Darren's house, she saw the lights were on inside. Loud music was pulsing through the walls, thrashing guitars and a heavy drumbeat. The singer screamed indecipherably. She rang the bell to no response, then knocked. Then rang again. \"Darren! Get the door!\" shouted a male voice. The music abruptly stopped. The sound of footsteps coming down the stairs. \"What?\" said an irritated teenage voice as the door opened inward. A short, skinny boy with a lot of facial piercings appeared in the doorway, glaring at her behind a fringe of blue and grey hair. The glare had the opposite of the effect he was probably going for, and made him look even smaller and younger than he would have otherwise. Despite the piercings, it was hard to believe he was a high school student. He looked fourteen at most. \"Are you Darren?\" said Dodger. The boy nodded. \"My name is Ms. James. I am a guidance counselor at a new school. We were wondering if you would be interested in attending.\" She got the impression Darren was resisting a powerful urge to slam the door in her face then and there. \"Yeah,\" he said sarcastically, \"right. Your school wants me.\" \"Why shouldn't we?\" \"Do you think I'm an idiot? When you say 'school', you're talking about juvie, right? Or maybe the funny farm?\" \"Just a school,\" said Dodger softly. \"Look,\" said Darren, \"I know when I'm being lied to. After what I did, no school is going to want me. I've accepted that. Now let me be.\" \"Doctor Hampton recommended you.\" At the name of his therapist, Darren's glower vanished. He glanced behind him, then said to Dodger, \"Okay. I'll talk to you. But can we walk?\" -/-/- Darren walked in silence with the woman for two blocks before saying anything. Then he blurted, \"I was considering dropping out. Before they expelled me, I mean.\" \"How come?\" said Dodger. \"I'm guessing you talked to my teachers. Good grades, right? Shit load of good that does to make high school more tolerable.\" -/-/- Flashback Darren looked down at the bottle in his hand, the white plastic unpleasantly bright in the harsh lights of the guys' washroom. He unscrewed the cap and poured several small, red pills into his palm. Darren took a deep breath, then threw his head back and dropped the capsules into his mouth. It was hard to swallow past the lump that had appeared in his throat. He twisted the tap and stuck his head under, gulping down water and pills. He emerged, throat sore, gasping for breath. He poured more pills from the bottle. Repeated the process until the container was empty, then went into a stall, locked the door and waited to die. He waited for half an hour, feeling nothing but the agitated tremble of his heartbeat, pumping through his palms and the soles of his feet. Then, gradually, a fever poured over him. His insides were on fire. He shook, cold sweat soaking his clothes. He couldn't breath, couldn't stand. He slumped down from his sitting position, sprawled on the floor like a broken toy. Powerless to escape as images raced through his mind. The pixels of his computer screen alight with the school test database he'd been hacking. The tests he'd printed off, solved. Gavin Trent's grin as Darren handed them over. Proud slaps on the back, invitations to parties, smiles from Gavin and his friends. Darren's friends, he had thought. The test that had ruined everything. The one that landed on his desk and he gaped at in horror, every question altered from the online. A trap, to catch the cheaters. Everyone angry at him, glaring at him. Slaps on the back now hard enough to bruise. A barrage of jokes with Darren as the punchline. Gavin offering him a chance to redeem himself. Telling him to hack the diploma exam, make sure all of them passed their high school courses. Darren's refusal and the way Gavin's face distorted, the way he shoved Darren into the wall behind and twisted his arm, as Darren cried out in surprise and pain and Gavin and his friends roared with laughter. The shoves and trips that appeared from all direction whenever he walked down the hall. The jeers and whispers. Words appearing on his desk overnight, that he scrubbed off in the hopes no one would see them. The day when, after school, he had been grabbed, dragged through the halls and shoved into a locker. He watched through the thin slots as hands fumbled with the lock, heard it click shut and clank against the metal, heard the sounds of his own hyperventilation and of departing footsteps and fading laughter. The fight with his brother the next day, when they'd finally let Darren out in the morning, and he came home shaking and vomiting and refused to say where he'd been all night. Darren's vision faded. Everything swarmed with black sand, like malfunctioning pixels. Then â€“ a voice. \"Hey, are you okay? Darren? Is that you?\" A face appeared under the stall door. He thought he recognized the person. Kyle Something. He was popular. But Darren couldn't be sure it was him. Couldn't be sure it was anyone. Maybe a hallucination, he thought dimly. Darren felt like he was disintegrating, getting smaller. Even the pain was subsiding. \"I'm coming in.\" Kyle clambered over the door, dropped down in front of him. \"What did you take?\" Darren tilted his head towards the bottle splayed on the floor. \"You're dehydrated. Just a second.\" Kyle unlocked the door, walked out. Darren felt profoundly lonely. And then Kyle returned. Hands cupped full of water. \"Drink.\" He did. It felt like life flowing back into him. Kyle brought him more water, and more. Darren's vision began to return, and he started to be able to feel his body again. \"Are you strong enough to stand now?\" \"Yeah,\" said Darren. His voice sounded awful, like a toad's croak. He got to his feet, Kyle helping him. They walked over to the tap. Kyle supported him as he drank more and more. \"You should eat something,\" said Kyle. \"It will slow down the rate at which your body absorbs the medication. It will make it so you can handle it. Come to my house.\" They left the school. It was spring but it was cold, the white of the sunlight reminding Darren of ice. \"My friend is sick,\" Kyle explained to the bus driver, and Darren felt his heart explode. Friend. -/-/- Dodger and Darren walked the cooling autumn landscape, dwarfed by the deep green trees. Darren said, \"I didn't know what I was doing with my life. Everything I'd been counting on wasn't there anymore. I had nothing.\" He let out a rattling sigh and, for the first time, met Dodger's eyes. \"And then I met this guy, Kyle McDermott. And everything changed.\" -/-/- In the next chapter: Dodger is recognized. Tom begins to investigate what exactly is going on. Where is Owen, and how does he keep getting into Dodger's house?[Chapter 7] Eye of the Storm Chapter 7 Emptying -/-/- \"Kyle was.... I thought he was great, okay?\" said Darren, as though t was a challenge. Dodger nodded. \"He was the first person who was actually there for me, you know? Well, besides my brother.\" \"How did you two meet?\" asked Dodger. \"He, um, helped me out of a bad situation.\" Darren paused, then added quickly, \" He was always doing that, getting me out of trouble. No one beat me up anymore after he started hanging out with me.\" \"What did he do to change things?\" \"He just... he was Kyle. You'd understand if you met him. Hell, even Gavin â€“ the asshat who started the kick-around-Darren club â€“ was scared of him. I mean â€“\" Darren looked puzzled by his own terminology â€“ \"...scared, that's not the right word. They respected him, I meant. Everyone liked Kyle.\" He looked as though he was going to say more, then stopped. \"So,\" said Dodger, \"what happened?\" \"You know, I really don't think I need to say any more. You probably know all about how everything got messed up.\" \"I'd like to hear your side of it.\" \"My side doesn't matter! I'm a freak, I was expelled, and people are going to believe whatever they want!\" He looked away from Dodger, but continued to walk beside her. She touched his shoulder. \"Have you tried changing their minds?\" \"Look at me. Blue hair, face full of metal, no street smarts and a weak personality â€“ no one would be surprised if I just dropped off the map. Maybe it would be better that way. No one would miss me.\" \"What about your brother?\" \"He's... I don't need to disappoint him anymore. I'm an embarrassment as a brother.\" \"He said that?\" \"No, but I know it's true. He took me in because I ran away from our parents, but all I really did was go from being dependent on them to dependent on him. I hate that.\" He let out a long breath. \"How great would that be, to not need anyone, to be perfectly well-off as a single unit?\" \"Most people aren't like that.\" \"Kyle was.\" \"Let's turn around,\" said Dodger. \"It's starting to get dark.\" She didn't think this would take much longer. \"Do you still keep in touch with Kyle?\" \"No.\" Dodger was silent, knowing he would say more. Several minutes later, he did. \"I can't. It's over between us â€“ he turned me in.\" \"How do you know?\" \"He told me. He told everyone.\" \"Are you angry with him?\" \"No.\" He looked her in the eye. \"No, I don't feel anything. Completely fucking blank.\" He laughed and turned away again. \"I just realized it, that's what this is. I have felt nothing since he betrayed me. It's like I'm dead.\" \"I'm sure you must care â€“\" \"No, I don't.\" \"- about something.\" \"Believe me, I wish I did.\" \"If you didn't care,\" said Dodger, as gently as she could, \"why did you refuse to talk about what happened?\" \"Because... because it was stupid, I guess.\" \"Will you talk about it now?\" He hesitated. Shrugged as though trying to shake off something unpleasant. \"Sure. Why not? Spill the entire, idiotic story and lie empty at you semi-sensible shoes.\" He paused, \"I like computers. It's something Kyle and I had in common. I was mostly into games and.... programming. I made this mod â€“ this, um, edit of a game. It was supposed to, like, look like... like our school. And I cast, um, Gavin and his friends as the enemies, I made characters that looked like them, and I... fought them.\" \"How did you fight them?\" \"It was a shooting game.\" \"And your teachers saw it and thought it was some sort of plan?\" \"Yeah. Well, it was pretty realistic and stuff, I had the security systems in the game set up like at school, I knew how to disable them â€“ but it was just stress-relief! The game's probably what stopped me from actually... nevermind.\" \"And then what happened with Kyle?\" \"He hacked into my computer one day at my house. I went to get a drink and came back to my room to find he was looking at my game. He said... he said I was going too far, and that he was reporting me for my own good. And then he left.\" Darren pressed a hand to his forehead. \"It didn't make sense, that was the main thing that got to me.\" \"How come?\" \"His games were way more realistic. He was the one who taught me how to program in the security systems, how to disable them... showed me how to modify the faces so they looked like real people. He made a really famous, popular mod. It's modeled after a real series of murders. You can find it online, it's called Wolf Mod.\" Dodger froze. \"Wolf Mod,\" she repeated. \"Yeah, you know the Westlake Prep murders? Well, it was a long time ago, but it's still pretty famous. It's based on those. My brother was â€“ hey, Ms. James? Are you okay?\" \"Yes,\" lied Dodger, forcing herself to walk. She knew the blood had drained from her face, she felt like running, or shouting, or standing very still, becoming a statue and standing forever until acid rain tore her apart. \"I just remembered something I have to do, I had better be getting home.\" Thankfully, Darren's house was in view. \"Oh. Okay. It was, um, nice talking to you.\" \"Yes, thank you for talking to me. It was very helpful.\" \"Well... that's good.\" Darren ascended the path to his house, and the front door opened. A person looked out, a man Dodger's age with as many piercings as Darren but stronger features and dark hair. Dodger quickly turned away, her heart skipping like a stuck record. Walked to her car as calmly as she could, conscious of her movements, trying to seem like anyone but herself. -/-/- \"Who was that?\" said Randall. \"Some guidance councilor,\" shrugged his younger brother. \"What was her name?\" Urgency burned in his voice, clearly startling Darren. \"Um, I think she said it was Ms. James.\" \"I have to make a phone call,\" said Randall. \"Okay,\" said Darren, confused. A moment later, Randall was flipping through a dog-eared notebook he hadn't used in years and yet still kept in easy reach. The name he was looking for caught his eye, and he punched the number he'd scrawled underneath into his phone. Three rings later, a voice on the other end said, \"Hello?\" \"Hi Tom. It's Randall.\" \"Oh, Um, hey, what's up?\" \"I know we haven't talked in ages but, um, I have a question.\" \"Okay.\" \"Is Dodger a guidance counselor? \"What? No, she's a teacher. High school.\" \"She told me brother she was a guidance counselor.\" \"Are you sure it was her?\" \"Yeah. She looked worried about something, and people are... you know, pretty recognizable when they're showing emotion like that.\" \"Okay,\" said Tom, \"I understand what you mean.\" His response surprised Randall, who added, \"And she had brown hair.\" \"She must have been wearing a wig.\" \"Why is she doing this?\" \"I don't know,\" said Tom. \"But I'm going to find out what the hell is going on.\" -/-/- As Tom hung up the phone, he knew what he had to do â€“ Owen would have some idea what was going on, he must be involved in it somehow. The problem was, Owen had given no clues as to where he had gone, and Tom knew the other man didn't have a cell phone. \"I like to be able to be away from everything, sometimes,\" Owen had explained. Well, he'd certainly got away. Tom looked out the window and saw the weather was decent. The storm clouds seemed to be blowing out, and the setting sun streaked the blue sky with amber. He decided to go for a drive. It had been a while since he'd really gone out, taken the car and just moved, beyond his usual chores of work, home, grocery story. There was so much out there, and as he felt the power of the vehicle under his control, the steering wheel humming under his hands, he was tempted several times to get on the highway, get out of town, go somewhere crazy. Leave this place and everything he owned behind. He resisted it â€“ he'd gotten good at crushing those feelings. He went into every hotel in the town, which only amounted to three. And at each of them, the secretaries shook their head, saying no one by that name had checked in. Owen was either out of town, using an alias, or had done something else entirely. Tom sensed that Owen wouldn't leave. He'd come here to do something, he wanted Dodger to be sorry for what she'd done, and he hadn't accomplished that yet. Owen wouldn't be using a fake name, either â€“ he wasn't sure how he knew this, but Tom was sure Owen wouldn't lie. That only left the last option, didn't it? Oh balls. He walked around a bit, saw, predictably, no indication of Owen, then got back in his car and headed for home. What an amazingly meaningful outing, he thought bitterly as he waited for a light to change. This was the way to Dodger's house, he noted. It was so strange to think that his friend, the girl who he had chatted with over coffee, was a murderer. It was a long time ago, but still â€“ to have the capability to do something like that... It was like they were talking about two different people, he couldn't process that the Dodger Allan he knew would do... that. So why did he take Owen's word for it.? He still had the route to her house memorized. The light changed and, instead of going straight to his place, as he'd planned, he took the turnoff. -/-/- Somehow, as Dodger walked towards her house, she was neither surprised nor particularly bothered to find the lights on. She opened and stepped through the unlocked door, took a quick look around, and said coolly, \"Hello, Owen.\" \"I was wondering when you'd show up,\" he said. From the sofa, he clicked the remote and the television show that had been playing vanished with a soft pop , replaced by a blank, black screen. \"Anything good on?\" she asked, kicking off her shoes and sitting down beside him. \"Not really.\" \"It figures. When you really need them, distractions are hard to come by.\" \"Rough day, I take it?\" \"You could say that.\" This was ridiculous. He had broken and entered, and they were talking like they were old friends (or something more). In less than 24 hours, she would be at a party hosted by a possible sociopath who knew the details of her past. She knew she should be angry, terrified, planning, plotting, running, fighting, pulsing with adrenaline, and yet... She felt as calm and blank as the television in front of them. Like all the emotions and ideas had played through, leaving her an empty vessel. It didn't feel bad. \"Can I ask you a question?\" she said, \"'Course,\" said Owen. \"How do you keep getting in?\" He reached into his pocket. \"Key,\" he said with a faint smile, holding it up. A small metal ring was threaded through the hole, though there were no other keys attached. This seemed meaningful to Dodger, though she couldn't say why. It wasn't for any intelligent reason, just one of those spontaneous observations that seemed to fit things together. \"Where did you get it from?\" \"Don gave it to me?\" \"Who?\" \"You don't remember the names of people you give your keys to?\" There was no mocking in his voice. In fact, he sounded almost... sad? She thought hard. Don. Guy in a suit. \"Oh, Don,\" she said, with what she hoped was a nonchalant hand gesture. \"Yeah, I had a... thing, with him. It's over now. How did you know about him?\" \"I asked about you at the school where you worked. Said I was a friend. Your coworkers seemed surprised.\" She said nothing. \"You don't have many friends, do you?\" More non-mocking. If it had been a taunt she could have gotten angry, but she was left with a vacuum. She felt like she might collapse in on herself. \"I don't need many friends,\" she said. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" \"Do I seem like the type who would?\" \"No.\" \"Exactly.\" She moved closer to him, put her arms around him and leaned in to his chest, towards the warmth of his body and the soft beat of his heart. The room was full of weapons and poisons. She could kill him, and he knew that. Kyle could kill her, could be planning it right now. She was going to that party. In the harsh contrast of life and death, she was brave. He put his arms around her, too.[Chapter 8] Eye of the Storm Chapter Eight Rationalizing ... Erik was going to die. Stop that, Carol told herself. You're jumping to conclusions. Fine, her brain countered. Erik is going to be alone with a serial killer. Want to take your own guess at the outcome? Shut up. But Erik wasn't like her. Kyle liked Erik, so he was safe, right? Kyle wouldn't let Dodger do anything to his friend. She made herself focus on the sound of her footsteps as she paced the wooden floor of the forest house. Outside, a woodpecker trilled. None of this managed to slow the speed of her thoughts. She wasn't like Erik. She didn't need to be popular. And though the thought of getting a confession from Dodger was exciting as a fantasy, she couldn't truthfully say she wanted this party. Her happiest moments were alone in her room, lying on her back in the dark, thinking of nothing but the sound in her headphones. Or with Erik, sitting on the roof in the forest, laughing about bad movies and playing Gameboy between the trees. Now Erik was always busy with Kyle, or talking about how great Kyle was or how awesome the party was going to be. He seemed more excited to be helping host a party than by the prospect of catching a murderer; so excited that Carol knew she had no way of backing out. She wanted him to be happy. But it had been weeks since she'd been able to listen to music without panicked thoughts intruding on her peace. And she couldn't even bring herself to go up to the roof anymore. Not when she knew what was in the attic she would have to climb through. ... Dodger hadn't played computer games in years, but the controls were easy to figure out. First person shooter. Of course it was. But the ammo meter in the side of the screen alerted her she only had a single bullet. Interesting twist. Kyle McDermott had rendered the halls of Westlake with meticulous accuracy, despite the blocky graphics of the game â€“ the information section in the file indicated it had been released three years prior. Unlike many of her students, Kyle had an attention span. A few details were off. Randall's piercings on the wrong side. He sprawled on the ground in the dark room, covered in the blood she knew was really a mix of corn syrup and food colouring. She raised the gun and blasted a hole in his chest, and he slumped forward. His whole body curved as though the wound had its own gravity. Fake blood mixed with real (no, digital, it's all fake, she reminded herself) and shone black in the darkness. Game over. Restart? This time, she hung back in the shadows. The Owen character walked through the hall, arms vibrating with what must have been meant to be panic. She watched as the brown-haired boy removed the gun from the desk, and she watched as Rich walked in to find him. The two engaged in an argument, entirely silent â€“ there was no sound in the game. But when Owen fired, the noise of the shot seemed to reverberate inside her, an echo from across years. The screen went black and gave her the option to play again. This time she shot Owen. He bent down to open the desk, then collapsed forward in a broken mess of blood. She looked at the real Owen, seated beside her at the computer. His eyes were fixed on the screen, but his expression betrayed nothing. His hands were folded on the table, perfectly still. He could have been watching a laundry detergent commercial for all the emotion he displayed. Restart. She shot Rich. She shot a stranger in the hallway. She fired randomly in frustration, bounced the bullet off a trophy case and killed her own character. Restart, restart, restart. Then she noticed, during the close-up of her own death, something behind her. This time she turned around, waited for the thing to draw nearer. It was a figure. A girl with red hair. And she wasn't following Dodger's character, but like Dodger, was following Owen as well. That part he'd got wrong. Dodger would never have risked implicating herself, would never have been so close to the scene â€“ no matter how much she'd wanted to see it. (Had she wanted to see it? There seemed to be a difference between wanting someone to die and wanting to be there when it happened, but she wasn't sure why there should be. It wasn't like her, not logical, thinking this way.) But the rest was disturbingly accurate. Whereas the other character's features were rough approximations, the representation of Dodger was painstakingly detailed, from the shape of her eyes and nose to the colour of lipstick she'd worn in those days. Dodger clicked. Her doppelganger's knees gave out as a dark hole blew through her chest, crumpling her against a wall. The doppelganger let out a ragged breath â€“ it took Dodger a moment to place why this disturbed her. It was the first sound in the game. Her eyes were still open, still the exact shade of blue as the real Dodger's. The camera zoomed in. Dodger's wound was a focal point â€“ even her inides had been rendered in extreme detail. A tide of blood swelled with each heartbeat. Then nothing. Zoom out. For the first time, the appearance of the player character became visible. A boy in his late teens with curly brown hair stood above the body of Dodger Allen and smiled. ... \"Can't say I'm surprised,\" said Dodger. \"So someone did believe me,\" said Owen quietly. \"No,\" said Dodger. \"He doesn't care about you. He knows how I think.\" Still quiet, Owen said, \"Did you love him?\" Dodger's mind gradually recovered from the nonsequiter and figured out who \"he\" referred to. She had never been easily emotional, nor sentimental in the least. She got a thrill out of being the best at things, and for most of elementary school, she'd studied hard, or at least, she'd studied. Pulled As in all her classes. But by the time middle school hit, she'd lost interest - she knew she could easily place highest, so what was there to prove? Nevertheless, she retained information well, and continued to score high marks, though less conspicuously. Not that she had lost interest in being the best. She simply took an interest in less academic areas. As a teenager, she had always been popular. She was good at talking, able to pick up on her conversational partner's interests and appeal to them. She and her friends would break into abandoned houses to play games and tell ghost stories - they never scared her, but she enjoyed their reactions to her own tales. They spent nights in construction sites, talking in the splintery rafters until dawn spread red ink over the horizon. She loved staying up late. Exhaustion tilted her perception just a bit off-kilter, so that her skin hummed and her eyes clung to colours so bright they stung. She felt invincible. And yet, at the same time, exhausted was the only way she felt like she had anything in common with the people around her. Rich was like that - another thrill. Lighting her up with points of energy the way only something forbidden could. He was the first person she'd kissed where she'd actually felt something, a wave of enjoyment coming over her body and taking her over. All her other kisses had been pieces of plots, steps in a plan, but now she wasn't thinking of the future. In a dark classroom with the sound of footsteps outside, for one of the few times in her life, she was happy. The other girl shouldn't have been a shock. Rich was like her, after all, going after what he couldn't have, chasing after excitement. But she disliked the irony - all her life, she'd wanted to relate to other people. Now she finally found someone like her, and rage blackened her insides every time she thought of the bastard. And she couldn't stop thinking about him. She dreamed about him, woke up with the wave of his energy subsiding from her, hollowing her out. He came into her thoughts when she saw a man with blue eyes, when someone with similar posture passed her in the halls. She was so angry all the time, and he didn't even know it. He pressed himself against her in his car as though nothing had changed, on the outskirts of town where city lights couldn't touch them. She watched the grey ceiling of the Toyota and fantasized about digging her nails into his back until she saw blood. At least rage was better than emptiness. \"No,\" she told Owen, knowing she could gain nothing by answering otherwise. \"It was exciting, that's all.\" His eyes were on the window. Streetlights glowed around the neighboring houses, fogging out the stars with light pollution. \"You definitely do think differently.\" \"How so?\" She was genuinely interested in his answer, and why he'd decided to tell her this now. \"I thought if I understood what you did, maybe I could forgive you. But you never lost control, did you? You wanted him dead, and you planned it out - you don't regret it, do you?\" She didn't answer. \"You're going to die if you go to this party.\" She shrugged. Her insides felt even blanker than usual. \"Are you still going to go?\" \"Of course.\" \"Why?\" She kissed him on the cheek, to confuse him, or for some other reason she didn't understand. \"I don't like losing control.\" ... \"You're awake.\" Carol's mother looked up from the refrigerator at the sound of her daughter's voice, smiled from underneath her tangled hair. \"You're home,\" she said. Carol didn't answer. She kicked off her shoes and left them askew on the floor. The way her mother used to hate, when she still had the energy to hate things. Her mother ignored the shoes. \"How was your day?\" Ignored the fact it was no longer any time close to day. \"Fine.\" She began to walk from the room, and her mother called, suddenly. \"I think the new medicine's working.\" \"That's good.\" She heard the older woman walking towards her, but didn't turn around. \"I was wondering if you wanted to do something tomorrow? We could go to the mall, or maybe watch a movie, like we used to?\" \"I have a party tomorrow.\" \"Oh.\" Her mother's voice was hurt. Carol glanced at her; she was still doing her best to smile. Her eyes were red-rimmed and the colour of shallow water. Carol quickly looked down at her own socks, instead. \"Whose party is it?\" \"Just some friends'.\" And she walked to her room, finally resolved that she would be at the forest house tomorrow. ... \"Hello?\" \"Hey, uh, is Erik there?\" \"This is Erik.\" \"Oh. Hey, it's Darren.\" Pause. \"Sorry, who is this?\" \"Darren. I used to, uh, go to your school.\" \"Sorry man, I'm not -\" \"You're Kyle's friend.\" Pause. \"What's your last name?\" \"Julian\" \"How did you get this number?\" \"The phonebook, asshat.\" \"I'm hanging up now.\" \"Wait, wait - I'm sorry. Wait. I haven't got out of the house much lately, my social skills got shitty, I'm sorry.\" \"Why are you calling me?\" \"Well... so, this guidance counselor came to my house yesterday, wanted to talk about what happened -\" \"You mean you planning to kill everyone?\" \"How many times do I have to fucking tell you guys -\" Deep breath. \"Look. Kyle's not a good guy, okay?\" \"And I should take your word for this.\" \"I was his friend too, okay?\" \"He never mentioned you.\" \"We weren't friends in public, okay? Just like you are with him.\" \"How did you know we were friends?\" Darren pauses, this time. \"I looked online. There were message boards with him and two other people. Carol had her name listed on one of them - I tried calling her house first, but no one answered. I figured the other guy had to be you.\" \"Um... I'm sorry, man, but I'm not sure -\" \"The Westlake Prep boards! All that fucking murder shit you guys are all obsessed with!\" \"Okay, okay, stop yelling, relax. Yeah, Carol and I hang out there. And we did talk to Kyle about that stuff. But he never told us he had an account.\" \"WestlakeWolf, remember?\" \"...That was him?\" \"Yeah.\" Darren breathes loudly on the other end, coming down from his previous explosion. \"He never mentioned that.\" \"It's him.\" \"I believe you.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Damn. Didn't see that coming.\" Pause. \"No one seems to believe me much, lately.\" \"Would you be able to tell me what happened with him?\" \"Yeah.\" A single laugh, more like a choke. \"Man, I'd be fucking honored.\" ... Friday morning, students noticed that, for the first time they could recall, Ms Allen looked tired. Her hair had been pinned back in a bun, and her cover-up failed to fully hide the circles under her eyes. When the bell rang, Kyle made a show of very slowly filling up his bag. Barely a second after the last other student had left the room, he approached her desk. \"I hope we're still on for tomorrow.\" \"I wouldn't miss it,\" said Dodger. She smiled for the first time that day.[Chapter 9] Eye of the Storm Chapter Nine Driving He slept with his back to her, or at least pretended to sleep. Both in their day clothes, on top of the covers. Lying down because there was nothing left to talk about, or no words for what they wanted to say. The sun breathed pink into the sky. She remembered neither falling asleep nor waking up, but something had brought her to this day. The day of the party. And of all things, she felt relieved. She walked to the kitchen and slid couple slices of bread into the toaster. Her eyes flitted over the newspaper as the clicking of the toaster oven ticked through the room. A few minutes later, a dark shape materialized in her peripheral vision. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"I didn't get a lot of sleep.\" The chair creaked gently as he pulled it across the floor and sunk down into a sitting position. She looked up from the paper - the words weren't staying in place in her head anyway. Owen's eyes were more shadowed than usual. \"Why do you care what happens to me?\" she said. \"Does there have to be a reason?\" \"Yes.\" The toaster dinged, and she stood, scraped the toast onto a plate with a fork. She thrust one piece at him and kept the other to herself. When she bit down, the taste was like ashes. But it was good to have something to chew on. He remained sitting as she leaned against the counter. He said, \"It's hard when someone you know dies.\" She looked at him. \"Even someone you hate.\" \"I don't hate you.\" \"Then you're an idiot.\" \"Maybe.\" He watched as she took a bite of the toast. If he wasn't so crazy, she would have felt self-conscious. As it was, she couldn't see him judging her - at least, not according to any rules she could make sense of. Dodger turned her head. The clock read 7:37 in red letters. Almost eleven and a half hours until the party. She knew she'd be counting down all day. \"I'm going to buy a gun,\" she said. He nodded. \"You don't already own one?\" \"Surprisingly, I live a pretty safe life here.\" \"Do you like it?\" \"I think so. I'm getting used to it, at least.\" \"This isn't what I expected you would be like now.\" \"You either.\" Since she figured the moment couldn't get any more surreal, she said, \"Would you like some cereal?\" \"I'm okay.\" With barely a pause, he added, \"I think I'll come along to the party.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" She couldn't think of any reason. \"Just don't.\" \"What I do isn't particularly any business of yours.\" \"It is in this case.\" She set her glass of water down, with a great effort not to slam it. \"Besides, it's dangerous.\" \"I find it difficult to believe you have my best interests at heart.\" She walked closer to him, straightened her posture. Said very quietly, \"Then why do you even care what happens to me?\" He looked back into her blue eyes and didn't say anything. She kissed him, hard and fast. Because she wasn't sure what else to do. Because she wanted to feel something. She wasn't sure if she did. Not what she wanted to feel, at least. His lips were soft. His mouth tasted the same as hers, tasted of the toast they'd both eaten. She waited for him to push her away, or slide his hands under her clothes, but he did neither. He kissed her back. For some reason, she felt as though she was about to cry - not the sadness, but the sense of something inside her trembling. A fragile part she thought she'd long ago killed. She pulled away, finished her water, and went to get dressed. His eyes followed her as she left the room, but he didn't stand up. ... \"What's up?\" Erik's head darted from side to side, long hair whipping at the sides of his face. \"Not here.\" \"But no one's here yet.\" \"I know, just... not here, okay?\" \"Okay.\" Carol followed him through the trees, away from the forest house. Moss squished under her shoes and branches snapped, setting off bursts of birdsong. They walked until the house was invisible behind the trees, along an erratically curving route Erik orchestrated. His steps were quick and jerky, like an overwound toy. In the years they had known each other, Carol didn't think she had even seen him run - all his energy seemed to go into his elaborate hand gestures. Now, as he struggled to climb over moss-furred logs without reducing his pace, Carol would have laughed if not for the certainty that something was wrong. Finally, he sat down on a large, grey root. \"So what's going on?\" said Carol, trying to keep her voice casual. \"I think - Kyle might be up to something.\" \"Oh. Really?\" She wasn't going for sarcasm, but it was hard to fake surprise. Interest, however, was still there. \"Yeah. I got a weird phone call yesterday. You know Darren from school?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"He was the kid who got expelled for making those plans - that game design, where he shot people.\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yeah. So like, he phoned me out of nowhere, and he told me to watch out for Kyle. That he set him up, and if we're his friends... he might do something bad.\" \"Any thoughts on what kind of something bad?\" He shook his head miserably. \"Look,\" said Carol, touching his arm. \"Are you really going to believe what some stranger says about him?\" \"No, but you told me you didn't trust him either.\" \"That meant something to you?\" \"Yeah, of course. You're the smartest person I know.\" \"Oh. Thanks.\" Her face felt warm. \"He does like you, though. And from what he told you - he wants to do something good, doesn't he? If he gets the confession, and Owen goes free -\" \"Owen's out.\" Erik moved his hands through his hair, making it stand up oddly. Underneath, his face was green-white. \"I checked, and his sentence was supposed to be seven years, like Kyle said - but they let him out early. Good behavior.\" \"But... then what else could he want?\" \"I don't know. But I have to go along with it, don't I?\" Carol wished she could say no. ... Dodger was not particularly fond of guns. They were obvious. Traceable. Though she'd found them useful when she was younger, she'd aquired a taste for subtler methods. She hadn't attempted to physically harm anyone since high school. She knew she could do it, so what was the point of rehashing that? Nothing was interesting if it wasn't a challenge. But she knew the importance of being prepared. She carried poisons in her purse, and she'd attained a firearms liscense years before. Just in case. The handgun now rested in her bag beside the switchblade, not intended for harm, but for a threat. A teenager might not fear the vial of poison, but she'd seen enough of Kyle's game to know he had a fixation with firearms. Killing him would bring needless complications; the cover-up would be difficult to pull with so many partygoers around. Possible, obviously - Kyle intended to do the same to her, and intoxicated teenagers wouldn't be the most observant witnesses. But her being there, older and not to mention a teacher, already implicated her as a figure of suspicion. She intended to get through the night with as little bloodshed as possible. And truth be told, she was rather looking forward to the excitement. Genuine excitement was hard to come by. \"There's the turn-off.\" Owen pointed from the passenger seat. The location was far out of town, an hour past city limits. Dodger had marvelled that anyone would show up, then recognized the area as being much closer to Kyle's old school. The one where he'd apparently been unpopular - though Dodger very much doubted the truth to that. If Kyle was as proud as she was as a teenager - and his figure in the video game, triumphantly waving his murder weapon, led her to believe he was - he'd never be able to stand for that. He had to be in control at all times. He had to be loved. Love gave him power over people. The sky darkened as the blue Mazda moved down the highway, layers of trees skimming past the window. The air was heavy with forest-sounds of cracking branches and the screech of hawks. Even in the car she could smell the pine. Past the canopy, a grey plume wavered towards the low red sun. A bonfire. This must be the place. She and Owen had passed most of the ride in silence, despite his occasional remarks on directions. He'd stepped through the door of the passenger seat as she set off to buy the gun, and that was that - she knew arguing would only make her frustrated, and as appealing as a hot rush of anger sounded, she had to be clearheaded tonight. When she'd returned with the gun, Owen had calmly asked her whether she intended to kill Kyle. \"Of course not,\" she said. For reasons she couldn't understand, something inside her had twinged painfully at his question. He didn't answer. They drove in silence. As they drew nearer the smoke, more sounds filled the air. The bass drum of too-loud, too-far music. Wordless young yells. She pulled up in a grey parking lot, alongside nine other cars - some battered but expensive, others cheap and out-of-date but meticulously cared-for. Teenager cars. And there were the teenagers, gathered around the orange flicker of flames, silver cans scatterred around their feet. Most of them stood, holding on to their girlfriends and boyfriends and sticks with charred, forgotten marshmallows. A few sat on mossy logs. One boy, on the porch of the huge, unpainted mansion behind the other kids, was instantly recognizable. He walked towards them, smiling. \"I didn't think you'd come,\" he said as Dodger opened the door above the asphalt. \"I keep my word,\" she replied, taking the hand he offered as she stepped out into the blue dusk. Kyle glanced toward Owen. \"And who is this?\" \"A friend,\" said Dodger. \"Owen,\" said Owen, stepping out to join them. Kyle's expression changed to something unreadable for a moment, then back to a smile. \"Pleased to meet you.\" The two shook hands. Then Kyle said, \"Unfortunately, the party is by invitation only...\" Grimacing as though this information pained him, despite him being the one to make these rules. \"That's fine. I was just leaving.\" \"Alright,\" said Kyle. He smiled at Dodger, slipped his fingers between hers. \"After all, you're here with me.

My grandfather built this house whennmy dad was eight. What is your dad's name? I think my dad works withna Thomas. I am not sure. Andrew and Leaha are my best friends too. Today, while my mom and I werentalking at the plaza here in Chicago, someone was crossing thenstreet. There was a car and a bus .It collided. The person got intonthe middle of it. He passed away in my arms. It was the mostndevastating thing. Mom told me to take sometime off from thenhospital. I was crying. I kept thinking about his family.nWhat would happen to them? I mean, they would be pretty upset. Anyway, the date is 2009. Not 2007.nI was adopted then. I have been a Wyler for 7 years. I was 16 inn2007 Sincerely, Allison Wyler.

He decided to write her back. Itncouldn't be, could it. Could he be writing to a girl from the future?
